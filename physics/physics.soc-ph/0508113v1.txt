Abstract

I propose the coeﬃcient, th, and its modiﬁcation Nt which in a simple way reﬂect dynamics of
scientiﬁc activity of an individual researcher. I determine th as a time period (from some moment in
the past till the present moment) during which papers responsible for 1/2 of the total citation index
were published. Parameter Nt represents average of the citation index over this period: Nt = C.I./2th.

Introduction

The problem of estimation of an impact of a scientist (or a group of them) is an actual one (see, for
example, [1] and references therein). Still, in many countries, for example in Russia, citation index
(C.I. hereafter) or its modiﬁcations are not widely used. Only now, especially in front of a possible
reorganization in the sphere of science, russian scientists and oﬃcials start to discuss problems related to
quantifying a scientiﬁc impact of individual researchers or their groups.

The task to quantify scientiﬁc output is non-trivial as many components are involved, and it is
impossible to describe fairly quality of a scientist by a single parameter (to prove harmony by algebra1).
The total impact can be more or less given by the C.I. (we do not discuss here such disadvantages of this
parameter as dependence on research topics, inﬂuence of promotion of results, personal contacts, etc.).
However, the structure of C.I. of a scientist (if it is mainly determined by a single paper with very high
C.I., or by several of them with medium C.I., or by numerous papers with very small C.I., etc.) is lost
when only one simple parameter is used. Diﬀerent modiﬁcations can be suggested. Recently, Hirsch [2]
proposed an interesting coeﬃcient which supplements the standard C.I. This parameter is sensitive to
the structure of C.I., i.e.
it can describe if the index is dominated by few papers or not. However, all
these parameters do not reﬂect dynamics of scientiﬁc activity. Below we propose a simple estimate which
can distinguish if the C.I. of a scientist is due to recent or old publications, so in principle it is possible
to estimate how it is probable that the scientist produce an important result in near future.

Time, years

Figure 1: A simple illustration of scientiﬁc activity of three scientists with the same total C.I., but with
diﬀerent distribution of important papers over time. On the vertical axis I show the number of citations
at the present moment to papers published in a given year.

2 Characteristic time

There were many attempts to include dynamics into bibliometric studies (see, for example, the citation age
in [1] which reﬂects the citation history of a given paper). It is important to determine a characteristic
time interval not arbitrary, but individually for each scientist. For example, one can think about a
minimum time (min ∆t) in a scientiﬁc career of a person, when papers responsible for 1/2 of the total
C.I. were published (obviously, for scientists who did the main contribution in one paper or in a set of
papers published during a short time min ∆t is short, vise versa for those who continuosly published
papers of the same level min ∆t is comparable with the duration of the career).
If one adds to this
min ∆t another parameter - time interval separating the present moment t0 from the end of the period
responsible for min ∆t - then we have a rough ﬁgure of scientiﬁc activity of a scientists in time. However,
I think that a better parameter can be deﬁned for clearness.

Here I discuss a simple way to estimate a characteristic applicable to individual scientists. Up to my

knowledge such a parameter was not discussed before.

The idea is to deﬁne some characteristic time which can demonstrate how long ago a scientist published
papers which give the main contribution to the C.I. I propose the parameter th which is deﬁned as follows.
It is the time (from the present moment towards the past) during which papers that are responsible for
1/2 of the total C.I. were published. Let me examplify it.

Imagine three scientists (see Fig.1). All started careers simultaneously. At the present moment all
three have the same C.I.=5000. One published in 1965 a paper with C.I.=5000, and nothing after that.
For him th = 40 years. The second published a paper with C.I.=2500 in 1965 and another one with the
same C.I. in 1975. For him we obtain th = 30 years. The third one also had published in 1965 a top-cited
paper with C.I.=1000, and then every year published a papers all of which now have C.I.=100. For him
th = 25 years as 1/2 of his C.I. is due to papers published after 1980.

All these values can be compared with another two limits (again we consider scientists with career
started in 1965, and with present-day C.I. equal to 5000). The ﬁrst limit is the following, consider
a scientist with a constant rate of publications all papers of whom now have equal number of citations
would have th = 20 yrs. Note, that such a researcher actually demonstrate a growth of scientiﬁc output as
his/her later papers quicker gain citations. Another limit (see also below) is a scientist with a constant rate
of publications all of which gain citations also with a constant rate. For him/her we obtain th
28.3 yrs.
Clearly, among these ﬁve scientists with equal C.I. those who demonstrated more activity recently has
shorter th.

Figure 2: Constant citation rate per paper and contant rate of publications.

Let us discuss the ﬁfth case in more details (see Fig. 2.). Consider a scientist who publishes papers
with a constant rate during his scientiﬁc career, and these papers recieve a constant number of citations
per year. In this case the number of citations of papers published in a given year is proportional to time.
Let us denote the coeﬃcient (i.e. the number of citations in a year per papers published in a given year)
A and the durations of a career as Tcar. So, we have Ncit = At. The total number of citations is:

.

We want to obtain th:

So, we obtain:

C.I. = AT 2

car/2

C.I. = At2

h/2 = AT 2

car/4

th = Tcar/√2.

The value Tcar/√2 is in some sense a critical one. One can expect for scientists active in recent time

th < Tcar/√2 independent on Tcar.

The parameter th alone is not a very useful thing as it says nothing about the total impact. But it
can be useful to distinguish researchers who’s activity is not in the far past. Even for the same total
C.I. th is shorter for those who published papers with large impact later. Especially, th can be useful
when both young and more senior scientists are under consideration. It appears indeed capable to ideally
complement the standard C.I. or Hirsch’s parameter h.

The main disadvantage of th is the following: variations of this value are not very large. However, as
we propose this quantity as a secondary coeﬃcient (i.e. to compare researchers with similar C.I.) even
small diﬀerences (a factor

1.5 – 2) are important.

It is possible to modify th to include information about the total C.I. And in the following section I

∼

show a possible way to do it.

3 Average activity over the characteristic time

After we determine th we know a characteristic time scale of scientiﬁc activity of a researcher. Now what
we can do is to average its C.I. (or better 1/2 of C.I. as th is related to half of the total index, and letter
h comes from half) over th. We deﬁne

Nt = C.I./2th.

For the ﬁve scientists in the example above Nt = 62.5, 83.3, 100, 125, and 88.4 correspondently. For
the same total C.I. values of Nt are diﬀerent demonstrating the fact that the ﬁrst one was unactive for
a long time, and the periods of activity (and recognition of the results) of the third and the fourth ones
are closer to the present moment than for the rest two researchers (the ﬁfth scientist in the example
shows the same rate of activity as the fourth, but rates of citation have diﬀerent time behaviour). For
the same C.I. Nt can be diﬀerent up to a factor of a few (or even by an order of magnitude) if persons
have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent histories of scientiﬁc activity.

The main disadvantage of the approach is the possibility to have relatively high Nt just by self-citation,

i.e. by publishing a huge amount of papers refering to own previous publications.

4 Conclusions

I presented a simple estimate th of a time scale which demonstrates dynamics of scientiﬁc activity of
scientists. Also the parameter Nt = C.I./2th was proposed as a compromise between integral and dy-
namical characteristics of scientiﬁc impact. In my opinion th can be a good additional parameter to the
standard C.I. value.

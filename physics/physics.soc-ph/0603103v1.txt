Abstract

This paper continues a series of studies devoted to analysis of the bi-
variate probability distribution P(x, y) of two consecutive price increments x
(push) and y (response) at intraday timescales for a group of stocks. Besides
the asymmetry properties of P(x, y) such as Market Mill dependence pat-
terns described in preceding paper [1], there are quite a few other interesting
geometrical properties of this distribution discussed in the present paper,
e.g. transformation of the shape of equiprobability lines upon growing dis-
tance from the origin of xy plane and approximate invariance of P(x, y) with
respect to rotations at the multiples of π/2 around the origin of xy plane.
The conditional probability distribution of response P(y|x) is found to be
markedly non-gaussian at small magnitude of pushes and tending to more
gauss-like behavior upon growing push magnitude. The volatility of P(y| x)
measured by the absolute value of the response shows linear dependence on
the absolute value of the push, and the skewness of P(y| x) is shown to in-
herit a sign of the push. The conditional dynamics approach applied in this
study is compared to regression models of AR-ARCH class.

1 Introduction

Intensive investigations over recent decades have revealed statistically signif-
icant deviations from an assumption of independent identically distributed
(IID) increments that underlies the random walk model of stock price dy-
namics. A direct statistical evidence showing signiﬁcant deviations from IID
using a BDS test [2] was presented in [3]. The rejection of the IID hypothesis
also follows from the volatility - based test described in [4]. There is a number
of dependence patterns showing themselves in such stylized facts as statisti-
cally signiﬁcant autocorrelations at intraday timescales, volatility clustering,
leverage eﬀect, etc. [4, 5, 6, 7], as well as correlations between simultaneous
increments of diﬀerent stocks. Each of these eﬀects corresponds to some sort
of probabilistic dependence between the lagged and/or simultaneous price
increments and their moments.

In a series of papers [1, 8, 9] including the present one we study further
evidence of the presence of dependence patterns in ﬁnancial time series. An
approach we apply is based on the direct analysis of the multivariate prob-
ability distributions of simultaneous and lagged price increments for both
single stocks and a basket of stocks. A simplest case we concentrate upon is
that of the bivariate distribution describing the interdependence of two price
increments in two coinciding or non-overlapping time intervals. We also con-
sider a natural and transparent interpretation of the bivariate probability
distribution provided by its sections corresponding to the ﬁxed value of one
of the variables, i.e. conditional distributions.

Despite their fundamental importance, multidimensional probability dis-
tributions of stock price returns (increments) are, to the best of our knowl-
edge, not widely used. The bivariate distribution of returns in two consecu-
tive intervals was analyzed, in the particular case of Levy-type marginals, in
[10], where some interesting geometric features of this distribution both for
the case of independent and dependent returns were described. As discussed
in [11], the bivariate distribution in question can be considered as a ”ﬁn-
gerprint” reﬂecting the nature of the pattern embracing the two consecutive
returns. Let us also mention the ”compass rose” phenomenon [12, 13, 14]
and the discussion of return predictability in [12] and [14]. Another line of
research is an explicit analytical reconstruction of the bivariate distribution
in question using copulas, see e.g.
[15, 16, 17, 18]. There is a few stud-
ies devoted to a direct analysis of the conditional distributions. Recently
an analysis of volatility dynamics exploiting such conditional distributions

2

was described in [19]. The ﬁrst moment of the corresponding conditional
distribution for daily time intervals was studied in [20].

At the same time the main focus of the eﬀorts to quantify the conditional
dynamics of ﬁnancial instruments was on constructing and studying the re-
gression models, see e.g.
[6, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Each
of these models realizes a particular version of the conditional dynamics, in
which parameters of the conditional distribution describing the forthcoming
increment depend on lagged increments and moments. In the simplest ver-
sion of ARCH model [6, 22] this conditional distribution is gaussian with
a standard deviation depending on the magnitude(s) of one or more lagged
increments. In GARCH models [6, 23] the conditional standard deviation de-
pends on lagged standard deviation as well. As such conditionally gaussian
approach did not allow to describe an observed degree of fat-tailedness of the
increments, further development included considering fat-tailed conditional
distributions [25] and, in modern versions [27, 28, 29, 30], the fat-tailed and
skewed conditional distributions in which fat-tailedness and skewness are con-
ditional as well. A case of nonlinear dependence of the conditional mean of
forthcoming increment on lagged increments could most naturally be treated
within a class of threshold autoregressive models [21].

An approach based on constructing regression type models is, by deﬁni-
tion, a parametric one. Assuming some speciﬁc form of increment dynamics
one runs statistical tests to determine optimal values of the parameters in
question. Our approach [1, 8, 9] is, on contrary, inherently non-parametric.
We do not use any assumptions on the particular form of probabilistic links
between price increments. The analysis of price dynamics is made in terms
of direct examination of the observed multivariate probability distributions.
In our study of dependence patterns in stock price dynamics [8] a direct
examination of the moments of the bivariate distributions linking consecutive
returns of a stock and simultaneous returns of a pair of stocks was performed.
It was shown that some empirical features of the bivariate distribution in
question, e.g. conditional volatility smile, result from non-gaussian nature of
the distirbution.

In the preceding paper [1] we analyze the asymmetry properties of the
bivariate probability distribution P(x, y) of two consecutive stock price in-
crements x (push) and y (response) resulting in remarkable market mill de-
pendence patterns. In the present paper we continue the analysis of [1, 8]
by a more close inspection of the properties of the full bivariate distribu-
tion P(x, y) of increments and the conditional distribution of the response

3

P(y| x). Therefore, despite the fact that we do not discuss speciﬁcally the
market mill properties in the present paper, this paper still belongs to the
series of studies [1, 8, 9] under the umbrella title - ”Market mill dependence
pattern ...”.

The paper is organized as follows.

In paragraph 2.1 we describe the

dataset and the probabilistic methodology used in our analysis.

A detailed description of the results is given in paragraph 2.2. In 2.2.1
we study geometrical properties of the full bivariate probability distribution
P(x, y). First we show that the shape of the equiprobability lines of the
distribution P(x, y) changes upon growing distance from the origin of xy
plane. Another property of P(x, y) is its approximate invariance with respect
to rotations at the multiple of π/2 around the origin of xy plane. In 2.2.2
we switch to studying properties of the conditional probability distribution
P(y| x) and ﬁnd that the volatility of P(y| x) measured by the absolute value
of the response shows linear dependence on the absolute value of the push,
and the skewness of P(y| x) inherits a sign of the push.

In the discussion section of the paper we ﬁrst concentrate on non-gaussian
properties of both the full bivariate distribution P(x, y) and conditional one
P(y| x) (see paragraph 3.1). We discuss that the conditional distribution
P(y| x) tends to more gauss-like behavior upon growing magnitude of the
push.

Our studies of the bivariate distribution are, by default, also studies of
a special version of the conditional dynamics in which information on the
value of a price increment is fully accounted for in describing the probabilistic
pattern characterizing the next increment. It is therefore of direct interest
to compare our results with the ones obtained within the regression model
approach. This is done in section 3.2 of the paper.

The paragraph 4 ﬁnalizes the paper by describing main conclusions and

outlook of the future studies.

2 Properties of push - return distribution

An analysis of the properties of the push - return distribution described in
the present paragraph continues the study initiated in [1]. It goes into further
details in describing the unique properties of the geometry of the bivariate
probability distribution under consideration and analyzes moments of the

4

corresponding conditional distribution 2.

2.1 Data and methodology

Our study of high frequency dynamics of stock prices is based on data on the
prices of 100 stocks traded in NYSE and NASDAQ in 2003-2004 sampled at
1 minute frequency3.

Let us consider two non-overlapping time intervals of length ∆T1 and ∆T2,
where the interval ∆T2 immediately follows after ∆T1. We shall denote the
price increment in the ﬁrst interval p(t1 +∆T1)−p(t1) (push) by x and that in
the second one p(t2 + ∆T2) − p(t2) (response) by y. In this study we consider
∆T1 = ∆T2 = 1 min., 3 min., 6 min. The full probabilistic description in
xy plane is given by the bivariate probability density P(x, y). An analysis
of the full bivariate distribution P(x, y) is often facilitated by considering
its cross-sections corresponding to conditional distributions such as, e.g., the
conditional distribution of response at given push P(y| x) = P(x, y)/P(x).

Let us stress that our data set combines pairs of price increments for
all stocks belonging to the speciﬁed group (see Appendix), so that a set of
events (pairs of increments) uniﬁes all subsets of events characterizing indi-
vidual stocks. A further detailed study of general features of the probability
distributions P(x, y) and P(y| x) constitutes the main topic of the present
paper and comprehends the analysis of [1] .

Let us note that analogously to [1] in our analysis we use price increments.
The results obtained using returns are in qualitative agreement to the ones
discussed in the present paper.

2.2 Structure of the bivariate distribution

Let us discuss properties of the bivariate distribution P(x, y).

2Although an analysis of the properties of the bivariate probability distribution and
the corresponding conditional distribution presented in the present paper is self-contained,
we strongly refer to [1] for a more comprehensive picture.

tive features seen in Fig. 1, let us sketch proﬁles of the equiprobability levels
of P(x, y) in Fig. 2, where the xy plane is divided into sectors numbered
counterclockwise from I to VIII. The shape of equiprobability lines shown
in Figs. 1,2 can be described as a superposition of a basic regular pattern,
rhomboid in the vicinity of the origin and circular away from it, perturbed
in such a way that each of the even sectors (II,IV,VI,VIII) contains more

probability density than each of the odd ones (sectors I,III,V,VII). The ge-
ometry of unperturbed basic regular pattern (shown in brown in Fig. 2) can
be described as

|x|α + |y|α = const ,

(1)

where α ∼ 1 in the vicinity of the origin and α ∼ 2 far away from it.

An interesting property of the bivariate distribution P(x, y) is its ap-
proximate invariance with respect to rotations at the multiples of π/2. The
distribution geometry is quite nontrivial: as already mentioned, all even sec-
tors contain more probability density than the odd ones 4. In terms of sample
paths (pairs of increments) composed by increments ±ζ1 and ±ζ2 the exact
symmetry with respect to rotations at multiples of π/2 leads to the following
chain of equalities:

P(ζ1, ζ2) = P(−ζ2, ζ1) = P(−ζ1, −ζ2) = P(ζ2, −ζ1) .

(2)
4The nontrivial asymmetric properties of the distribution P(x, y) leading to the market
mill structure and z-shaped structure of the conditional mean response was analyzed in
full details in [1].

(3)
(4)

(5)

An approximate character of the symmetry with respect to rotations at mul-
tiples of π/2 shows itself in varying degree of proximity of the corresponding
distributions. To give a quantitative estimate of this proximity we consider
three bivariate probability distributions P π/2(x, y), P π(x, y) and P 3π/2(x, y)
obtained by rotating the original distribution P(x, y) at an angle φi = i · π/2,
where i = 1, 2, 3. To compute a distance between two matrices corresponding
to distributions P φi(x, y) and P φj (x, y) obtained by rotations of P(x, y) at
φi and φj respectively we ﬂatten each of them into a vector, normalize it
and compute a distance D1(φi, φj) ≡ distL1(P φi, P φj ) between these vectors
using the L1 (”Manhattan”) metric5. We ﬁnd

D1(0, π/2) = D1(0, 3π/2) = D1(π/2, 3π/2) = D1(π, 3π/2)

D1(0, π) = D1(π/2, 3π/2)

and

D1(0, π)
D1(0, π/2

=

D1(π/2, 3π/2)
D1(π/2, π)

= 0.34

Therefore we see that the rotation at π is a ”better” symmetry of the full dis-
tribution than the rotation at π/2 implying, in turn, that equality P(ζ1, ζ2) =
P(−ζ1, −ζ2) holds to a better accuracy than P(ζ1, ζ2) = P(−ζ2, ζ2).

2.2.2 Geometry of response proﬁle

A detailed view on the distribution P(x, y) is provided by examining the
corresponding conditional distributions such as, e.g., P(y|x) = P(x, y)/P(x)
describing the probabilistic shape of response y at given push x. In Fig. 3
we plot three cross-sections of the surface log P(x, y) corresponding to x =
$ 0.01, 0.07 and 0.25. We observe a clear change in the structure of the
response with growing push. Qualitatively this change can be described
by evolution of the parameter α in the stretched exponential distribution
Pα(x)(y) = N (α(x)) exp
from α(x) ∼ 1 at small |x| to
α(x) ∼ 2 at large |x|, so that the distributions looks evolving from the
squeezed tent-like at small pushes to almost gaussian at large ones. Note
that this interpretation is consistent with the suggested description of the
geometry of equiprobablity lines in Eq. (1).

2.2.3 Moments of conditional distribution

Let us ﬁrst consider a useful quantitative characteristics of a shape of the
distribution P(y| x), the conditional mean absolute response

h| y|ix =

dy| y| P(y| x) .

Z

(6)

The dependence of h|y|ix on the push x is plotted in Fig. 4. We see that
to a good accuracy the mean absolute response is linear in the absolute
value of the push, h|y|ix ∝ c0 + c1 |x|. Let us recall that the mean response
hyix is a nonlinear function of the push x [1]. As the absolute response is
a robust measure of volatility, in Fig. 4 we have an example of conditional
volatility smile or dependence volatility smile that was studied, in terms of
a standard deviation of normalized returns, in [8]. The dependence of h|y|ix
on x describes how much of response volatility is created for a given push.

Because of the sensitivity of the mean conditional absolute response to
the higher moments of the conditional distribution one can, by comparing
it to the value obtained for the Gaussian distribution with the same stan-
dard deviation, gauge the deviation of the distribution in question from the
Gaussian [7]. Let us thus consider the following ratio:

Figure 5: Relative distance from the Gaussian distribution ρx

pattern seen in Fig. 5 unambiguously shows the progressive ”gaussization” of
the response proﬁle with growing push. This is a highly nontrivial property
of the distribution P(x, y). The same question can be addressed by com-
puting the anomalous kurtosis of the conditional distribution. The results
obtained for anomalous kurtosis support the conclusion on ”gaussization”
but are rather noisy, especially for the case of 1 minute intervals.

The mean absolute response by default characterizes the symmetric com-
ponent of the conditional probability distribution P(y| x) with respect to the
axis y = 0. Asymmetry of P(y| x) with respect to this axis is characterized

11

r
by its odd moments. The ﬁrst moment, the mean conditional response, was
studied in detail in [1]. It was shown that the mean conditional response has
a nontrivial zizgag-shaped dependence on the push. To probe the asymmet-
ric contributions of higher order, let us consider the skewness V(x) of the
conditional response6

V(x) = R

dy (y − hyix)3 P (y| x)
x)3

(σy

,

(8)

where σy
x is the conditional standard deviation of response at given push.
In Fig. 6 we plot the skewness of the response for the same set of consecu-
tive time intervals. The pattern seen in Fig. 6 corresponds to an interesting
phenomenon. The asymmetry of the distribution of conditional response
characterized by skewness has the sign of the initial push, so that for nega-
tive pushes the response distribution is always negatively skewed, etc. Let
us note that the same conclusion can be reached by considering a robust
characteristics of distribution asymmetry, a diﬀerence between the median
of the distribution and its mean.

The generic symmetry properties of the distribution P(x, y) are best re-
vealed by considering its symmetry with respect to the axes y = 0, y =
x, x = 0 and y = −x (patterns I – IV) [1]. The patterns are of two types:
pattern I is equivalent to pattern III and pattern II is equivalent to pattern
IV. Pattern I was analyzed above, so let us consider pattern II. To analyze
the symmetry properties of the distribution P(x, y) with respect to the axis
y = x it is convenient to introduce the new variables

z = x + y and

˜z = y − x

(9)

so that in this case one deals with the conditional distribution P(˜z|z).

The dependence of the shape of P(˜z|z) on the ”push” z can again be

explored by considering the ratio

ρz =

h|˜z|iz
h|˜z|iG
z

≡

h| y − x|ix+y
h| y − x|iG

x+y

(10)

The ratio ρz is plotted in Fig. 7. The generic pattern is the same as in Fig. 5:
the distribution P(˜z|z) is progressively more and more gaussian with growing
|z|. The shape is somewhat diﬀerent though, so that the gaussization process
is diﬀerent in this case.

6Here we assume that the third moment of the conditional distribution exists.

3 Discussion

In the previous section we discussed a number of properties characterizing
the probabilistic dependence patterns relating stock price increments in con-
secutive time intervals. Our approach is based on the direct analysis of the
bivariate probability distribution dependent on the two price increments in
question P(x, y) and of the corresponding conditional distribution P(y| x).
We have concentrated on high frequency data with increments in time inter-

13

vals of length ∆T = 1 min., 3 min. and 6 min7.

3.1 Gaussization of conditional distribution at large

magnitudes of price increments

Let us ﬁrst discuss in some more details a remarkable property of gaus-
sization of multivariate distributions of price increments far away from the
origin in the xy plane. A ﬁrst hint comes from the analysis of the geometry
of equiprobability levels of the push - response bivariate probability distri-
bution P(x, y). As seen in Fig. 1 and sketched in Fig. 2, the geometry of
equibrobability lines changes from rhomboid in the vicinity of the origin to
circular far away from it, which is consistent with distribution changing the
shape from bivariate Laplace to bivariate gaussian one. This is, however, not
a proof of gaussization: a Laplace distribution with standard deviation of
P(y|x) growing with |x| leads to the same visual pattern.

Quantitative proof of gaussization comes from considering the ratio ρx
deﬁned in eq. (7) characterizing the shape of the conditional response distri-
bution. In this ratio the eﬀect of variable conditional standard deviation is
factored out. We have checked the gaussization of the bivariate distribution
P(x, y) along the two axes, y = 0 and y = x (see Figs. 5 and 7). The speed
of gaussization turns out diﬀerent, but the phenomenon itself is undoubtedly
present in both cases.

3.2 Conditional dynamics: direct analysis of multivari-

ate distribution vs regression models

Knowledge of full bivariate distribution fully speciﬁes corresponding condi-
tional distributions and, therefore, a particular variant of conditional dynam-
ics. As already mentioned in the introduction, the main body of research on
conditional dynamics in ﬁnancial markets was done within a paradigm of
regression models [6, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], in which con-
ditional distribution for the forthcoming price increment depends on lagged
increments and lagged conditional moments. In the simplest version of the
AR(1)-ARCH(1) model [6, 22] the conditional distribution of the return ry
7The results of [1] show that it is reasonable to expect that all the features discussed

in the present paper will hold at larger intraday time scales as well.

14

y = α + β r2

is gaussian, Law(ry) = PG(ry| µy, σy), where conditional mean µy and con-
ditional standard deviation σy depend on return rx in the previous interval,
µx ∝ rx and σ2
x. This setting is methodologically equivalent to
the one considered in the present paper in the sense that the only informa-
tion required for computing the conditional distribution for ry is the value
of rx, so that the conditional dynamics of AR(1)-ARCH(1) is fully described
by conditional distribution P(ry| rx). To match the features described in
the preceding [1] and present papers one would have to consider a nonlinear
dependence of µy on rx and construct a fairly complicated fat-tailed skewed
conditional probability distribution. Even forgetting for a moment about the
z-shaped dependence of mean conditional response on the push, meaningful
comparison could be with a version of ARCH(1) with a fat-tailed skewed
conditional distribution. As to the zigzag-shaped dependence of the mean
conditional response on the push, the most natural treatment could be given
within a class of threshold autoregressive (TAR) models [21].

To compare our results with the properties of autoregressive models con-
sidered in the literature let us consider the AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model [6, 23],
particularly its versions with fat-tailed [25] and conditionally fat-tailed and
skewed conditional distributions for residuals [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. In these
models conditional volatility is a function of both lagged returns and volatil-
ity, so a comparison with the results obtained using the bivariate distribution
P(x, y) is not direct. With this remark in mind, let us make some comparison
at the ”moment by moment” basis.

• The conditional mean in the AR(1) model is by default a linear function
of the push, µx ∝ rx. This is equivalent to an assumption of the
ellipticity of the underlying bivariate distribution P(rx, ry). As shown
in [1], the intraday conditional dynamics is characterized by a fairy
complex nonlinear z-shaped pattern of mean conditional response. To
take this into account one should generalize AR(1) to TAR(1).

• The conditional standard deviation σy in GARCH(1,1) models is a
y = const. + r2
x + εσ. This is consistent with

growing function of rx, σ2
the dependence smile discussed in [8] and shown in Fig. 3.

• The results obtained in the framework of generalized GARCH models
for the conditional skewness [26, 27, 28, 29, 30] (only the daily timescale
was considered) are somewhat contradictory. In [18, 27, 28, 29] a con-
clusion was that negative return is followed by negative conditional

15

skew - in agreement with the results of the previous section, while no
conclusion on the sign of conditional skew following the positive return
was reached. At the same time, the conclusion of [30] was that the sign
of conditional skew is always opposite to the sign of initial return.

• The main result on conditional kurtosis obtained within the generalized
GARCH approach was [28] that it is time dependent and not always
existent. A comparison with our result on the progressive gaussization
of the response distribution with growing magnitude of the push does
not seem possible.

Our method of directly analyzing the conditional distribution allows to
describe its properties in a model-independent framework. If analyzed from
the point of view of regressive conditional dynamics the results described in
the present paper and in the preceding paper [1] can be formulated as follows.
The conditional dynamics is

• nonlinear

• heteroskedastic as seen in the volatility dependence smile

• not conditionally gaussian

• characterized by conditional skew depending on the lagged increment

• characterized by conditional fat-tailedness that diminishes with grow-

ing magnitude of lagged increment

4 Conclusions and outlook

Let us formulate once again the main conclusions of the paper. Studying
the geometry of the full bivariate probability distribution P(x, y) and the
corresponding conditional distribution P(y| x) we have found that

• The shape of equiprobability lines of the bivariate probability distri-
bution P(x, y) changes from roughly rhomboid in the vicinity of the
origin to roughly circular far away from it.

• The conditional distribution P(y| x) is shown to become progressively
more gaussian at increasing push magnitudes. Analogous gaussization

16

takes place for conditional distribution considered with respect to the
axis y = x.

• The bivariate distribution P(x, y) is approximately invariant with re-

spect to rotations at multiples of π/2

• The conditional mean absolute response is linear in the absolute value

of push

• The skewness of the response distribution inherits a sign of the push

As was emphasized above in [1] and the present paper we study a com-
bined ensemble of all pairs of consecutive price increments from all stocks.
How is this overall geometry related to the geometric properties of individual
stocks? Only after answering this question can one come close to describing
the microscopic mechanism underlying the uncovered probabilistic depen-
dence patterns. This issue is analyzed in the companion paper [9].

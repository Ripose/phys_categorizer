We analyze an ideal gas like models of a trading market. We propose a new
ﬁt for the money distribution in the ﬁxed or uniform saving market. For the
market with quenched random saving factors for its agents we show that the
steady state income (m) distribution P (m) in the model has a power law tail
with Pareto index ν exactly equal to unity, conﬁrming the earlier numerical
studies on this model. We analyze the distribution of mutual money diﬀerence
and also develop a master equation for the time development of P (m). Precise
solutions are then obtained in some special cases.

1 Introduction

The distribution of wealth among individuals in an economy has been an
important area of research in economics, for more than a hundred years. Pareto
[1] ﬁrst quantiﬁed the high-end of the income distribution in a society and
found it to follow a power-law P (m) ∼ m−(1+ν), where P gives the normalized
number of people with income m, and the exponent ν, called the Pareto index,
was found to have a value between 1 and 3.

Considerable investigations with real data during the last ten years re-
vealed that the tail of the income distribution indeed follows the above men-
tioned behavior and the value of the Pareto index ν is generally seen to vary
between 1 and 2.5 [2, 3, 4, 5]. It is also known that typically less than 10% of
the population in any country possesses about 40% of the total wealth of that
country and they follow the above law. The rest of the low income popula-
tion, in fact the majority (90% or more), follow a diﬀerent distribution which
is debated to be either Gibbs [3, 6] or log-normal [4].

Much work has been done recently on models of markets, where economic
(trading) activity is analogous to some scattering process [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

12]. We put our attention to models where introducing a saving factor for
the agents, a wealth distribution similar to that in the real economy can be
obtained [7, 8]. Savings do play an important role in determining the nature of
the wealth distribution in an economy and this has already been observed in
some recent investigations [13]. Two variants of the model have been of recent
interest; namely, where the agents have the same ﬁxed saving factor [7], and
where the agents have a quenched random distribution of saving factors [8].
While the former has been understood to a certain extent (see e.g, [14, 15]),
and argued to resemble a gamma distribution [15], attempts to analyze the
latter model are still incomplete (see however, [16]). Further numerical studies
[17] of time correlations in the model seem to indicate even more intriguing
features of the model. In this article, we intend to study both the market
models with savings, analyzing the money diﬀerence in the models.

2 The model

The market consists of N (ﬁxed) agents, each having money mi(t) at time
N
t (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ). The total money M (=
i mi(t)) in the market is also
ﬁxed. Each agent i has a saving factor λi (0 ≤ λi < 1) such that in any trading
(considered as a scattering) the agent saves a fraction λi of its money mi(t)
at that time and oﬀers the rest (1 − λi)mi(t) for random trading. We assume
each trading to be a two-body (scattering) process. The evolution of money
in such a trading can be written as:

P

mi(t + 1) = λimi(t) + ǫij [(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj(t)] ,

mj(t + 1) = λjmj(t) + (1 − ǫij) [(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj (t)]

where each mi ≥ 0 and ǫij is a random fraction (0 ≤ ǫ ≤ 1). In the ﬁxed
savings market λi = λj for all i and j, while in the distributed savings market
λi 6= λj with 0 ≤ λi, λj < 1.

3 Numerical observations

In addition to what have already been reported in Ref. [8, 9, 10] for the model,
we observe that, for the market with ﬁxed or uniform saving factor λ, a ﬁt to
Gamma distribution [15],

P (m) ∼ mη exp(−m/T ),

is found to be better than a log-normal distribution. However, our observation
regarding the distribution D(∆) of diﬀerence ∆ ≡ |∆m| of money between
any two agents in the market (see Fig. 1a) suggests a diﬀerent form:

In fact, we have checked, the steady state (numerical) results for P (m) asymp-
totically ﬁts even better to (3), rather than to (4).

With heterogeneous saving propensity of the agents with fractions λ dis-
tributed (quenched) widely (0 ≤ λ < 1), where the market settles to a critical
Pareto distribution P (m) ∼ m−(1+ν) with ν ≃ 1 [8], the money diﬀerence be-
haves as D(∆m) ∼ (∆m)−(1+γ) with γ ≃ 1. In fact, this behavior is invariant
even if we set ǫij = 1/2 [18]. This can be justiﬁed by the earlier numerical
observation [7, 8] for ﬁxed λ market (λi = λ for all i) that in the steady state,
criticality occurs as λ → 1 where of course the dynamics becomes extremely
slow. In other words, after the steady state is realized, the third term con-
taining ǫ = 1/2 becomes unimportant for the critical behavior. We therefore
concentrate on this case in this paper.

4 Analysis of money diﬀerence

In the process as considered above, the total money (mi + mj) of the pair of
agents i and j remains constant, while the diﬀerence ∆mij evolves for ǫ = 1/2
as

(∆mij )t+1 = αij(∆mij )t + βij(mi + mj)t,

where αij = 1

dλ λγ = 2(1 + γ)−1,

giving γ = 1. No other value ﬁts the above equation. This also indicates that
the money distribution P (m) in the market also follows a similar power law
variation, P (m) ∼ m−(1+ν) and ν = γ.

5 Master equation approach

We also develop a Boltzmann-like master equation for the time development
of P (m, t), the probability distribution of money in the market [18]. We again
consider the case ǫij = 1

Analyzing money distributions in ‘ideal gas’ models of markets

6 Summary

We consider the ideal-gas-like trading markets where each agent is identi-
ﬁed with a gas molecule and each trading as an elastic or money-conserving
(two-body) collision [7, 8, 9, 10]. Unlike in a gas, we introduce a saving fac-
tor λ for each agents. Our model, without savings (λ = 0), obviously yield
a Gibbs law for the steady-state money distribution. Our numerical results
for uniform saving factor suggests the equilibrium distribution P (m) to be
somewhat diﬀerent from the Gamma distribution reported earlier [15].

For widely distributed (quenched) saving factor λ, numerical studies
showed [8, 9, 10] that the steady state income distribution P (m) in the market
has a power-law tail P (m) ∼ m−(1+ν) for large income limit, where ν ≃ 1.0,
and this observation has been conﬁrmed in several later numerical studies as
well [16, 17]. It has been noted from these numerical simulation studies that
the large income group people usually have larger saving factors [8]. This, in
fact, compares well with observations in real markets [13, 19]. The time corre-
lations induced by the random saving factor also has an interesting power-law
behavior [17]. A master equation for P (m, t), as in (9), for the original case
(eqns. (1) and (2)) was ﬁrst formulated for ﬁxed λ (λi same for all i), in [14]
and solved numerically. Later, a generalized master equation for the same,
where λ is distributed, was formulated and solved in [16] and [18]. We show
here that our analytic study (see [18] for details) clearly support the power-law
for P (m) with the exponent value ν = 1 universally, as observed numerically
earlier [8, 9, 10].

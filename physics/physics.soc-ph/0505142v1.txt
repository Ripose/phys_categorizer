Risk contributions in an asymptotic multi-factor framework

Dirk Tasche∗†

May 20, 2005

Abstract

So far, regulatory capital requirements for credit risk portfolios are calculated in a bottom-
up approach by determining the requirements at asset level and then adding up them. In
contrast, economic capital for a credit risk portfolio is calculated for the portfolio as a whole
and then decomposed into risk contributions of assets or sub-portfolios for, e.g., diagnostic
purposes like identifying risk concentrations. In the “Asymptotic Single Risk Factor” model
that underlies the most important part of the “Basel II Accord”, bottom-up and top-down
approach yield identical results. However, the model fails in detecting exposure concentra-
tions and recognizing diversiﬁcation eﬀects. We investigate multi-factor extensions of the
ASRF model and derive exact formulae for the risk contributions to Value-at-Risk and Ex-
pected Shortfall. As an application of the risk contribution formulae we introduce a new
concept for a diversiﬁcation index. The use of this new index is illustrated with an example
calculated with a two-factor model. The results with this model indicate that there can be
a substantial reduction of risk contributions by diversiﬁcation eﬀects.

Introduction

Credit risk, i.e. the risk that borrowers do not fully meet their obligations, is considered the most
important risk banks are facing. During the past decade, therefore, banks as well as banking
supervisory authorities put considerable eﬀorts in developing models for quantitative assessments
of credit risk. These eﬀorts were accompanied by a growing interest of the academic community
in credit risk models. Compared to models of market risk or actuarial models, credit risk models
have some interesting special features. In particular, they produce non-normal loss distributions
and reﬂect the empirically observed dependence of credit events.

While the more advanced large banks rely more and more on very sophisticated credit risk
models in order to take into account these features, banking supervisors worldwide intend to

implement a minimum standard of credit risk modelling which can also be met by smaller banks.
The process of designing this standard (“Basel II”) is coordinated by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Although some details are still under discussion, the BCBS
published at the end of June 2004 a framework with the status quo of its recommendations
(BCBS, 2004). Most important in this so-called “Basel II Accord” is the part on the “Internal
Ratings Based Approach” (IRBA) for the determination of regulatory capital requirements for
credit risk. It is regarded as a ﬁrst step towards a supervisory recognition of advanced credit
risk models and economic capital calculations.

According to the IRBA, the regulatory minimum capital for a credit risk portfolio is calculated
in a bottom-up approach by determining capital requirements at asset level and adding up them.
The capital requirements of the assets are expressed as 8 percent of the so-called “risk weights”.
The risk weight functions were developed by considering a special credit portfolio model, the
so-called “Asymptotic Single Risk Factor Model” (ASRF model, Gordy, 2003). This model is
characterized by its computational simplicity and the property that the risk weights of single
credit assets depend only upon the characteristics of these assets, but not upon the composition
of the portfolio (“portfolio invariance”). As a consequence, the model can reﬂect neither exposure
concentrations nor segmentation eﬀects (say by industry branches).

The model’s inability to detect exposure concentrations entails a potential underestimation of
the risk inherent in the portfolio, whereas its fault in recognizing the diversiﬁcation eﬀects fol-
lowing from segmentation could result in a potential overestimation of portfolio risk. The Basel
Committee decided to deal in Pillar 2 of the Basel II Accord (BCBS, 2004) with the potential
underestimation of risk concentration. As a consequence there is no automatism of extended
regulatory capital requirements for risk concentrations, but banks will have to demonstrate to
the supervisors that they have established appropriate procedures to keep concentrations under
control. Nevertheless, there are methods to measure quantitatively risk concentrations. A quan-
titative way of tackling the exposure concentration issue was suggested in Emmer and Tasche
(2005), for instance.

In the present paper, we suggest a minimal – in the spirit of Emmer and Tasche (2005) –
extension of the Basel II model that allows to study the eﬀects of segmentation on portfolio risk.
Admitting several risk factors instead of a single factor only and applying the same transition
to the limit as described in Gordy (2003), we arrive at versions of the model that remove the
no segmentation restriction. Alternatively, our class of models can be regarded as special cases
of the asymptotic models introduced by Lucas et al. (2001, Theorem 1).

As determining risk contributions or, economically speaking, capital requirements for assets or
sub-portfolios, is a main purpose when using credit risk models, deriving exact formulae for risk
contributions to “Value-at-risk” (VaR) and “Expected Shortfall” (ES) in the asymptotic multi
risk factors setting represents the main contribution of our paper to the subject. Our results
complement results on the diﬀerentiation of VaR and ES presented in Gouri´eroux et al. (2000),

2

Lemus (1999), and Tasche (1999). From a computational point of view, the resulting formulae
are more demanding than in the one factor case, and – necessarily, as otherwise diversiﬁcation
eﬀects could not be recognized – they are not portfolio invariant any longer. As an application
of the risk contribution formulae we introduce then a new concept for a diversiﬁcation index.
This index can be computed at portfolio as well as at sub-portfolio or asset level, thus allowing
for identifying the causes of bad diversiﬁcation. The use of these new indices is illustrated with
an example calculated with a two-factor model. The results with this model indicate that there
can be a substantial reduction of risk contributions by diversiﬁcation eﬀects.

The material presented here is closely related to work by Pykhtin (2004) and Garcia et al. (2004).
Pykhtin describes an approximation of multi-factor models by single-factor models, thus trans-
ferring the computational simplicity of single-factor models to multi-factor models. Garcia et al.
propose “factor adjustments” to the risk contributions from a single-factor model in order to re-
ﬂect diversiﬁcation eﬀects. As our results on the risk contribution formulae are not approximate
but exact they could be used for benchmarking the results by Pykhtin and Garcia et al.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the class of models we are going
to analyze and derive some basic properties. In Section 3 we shortly recall the Euler allocation
principle that justiﬁes the use of partial derivatives as risk contributions and derive then the
announced formulae for risk contributions to VaR and ES in the asymptotic multi-factor setting.
A potential application of the risk contribution formulae for the purpose of identifying sources
of concentration risk is suggested in Section 4 where a new concept for a diversiﬁcation index
is introduced. Section 5 gives a numerical illustration of a potential application of the formulae
and the diversiﬁcation index. We conclude with some summarizing comments in Section 6.

2 Asymptotic multi-factor models: basic properties

The starting point for the factor models1 we are going to consider is a random variable ˜L(u) =
˜L(u1, . . . , un) that reﬂects the loss suﬀered from a portfolio of n credit assets, with respective
exposures ui. The tilde indicates that we regard the original loss variable, without any approxi-
mation procedure. The variable ˜L(u) can be interpreted as the absolute loss, measured in units of
some currency. Then the ui are absolute exposures2 and amounts of money. Alternatively, ˜L(u)
can also be understood as relative loss, indicating the percentage of the sum of all exposures
that is lost. In this case the ui are non-negative numbers without units that add up to 1.

Formally, the original loss variable ˜L(u) is given as

˜L =

ui 1Di.

(2.1)

1See Bluhm et al. (2002) and the references therein for more information on credit risk models.
2ui may be thought as a face value multiplied with some factor that expresses the average loss rate in case of

default.

i=1

The term 1Di is the default indicator variable for asset i, i.e. it takes the value of 1 if i defaults
and 0 if not. As a consequence, the sum in (2.1) will be built up with only those ui’s that relate
to defaulted assets i. For factor models, it is quite common to specify the default events Di by

Di =

with the following for the involved constants and random variables:

•

The random variables S1, . . . , Sk are the systematic risk factors. They are assumed to
capture the dependence of the default events. In general, we have k
n. Within this
paper, we assume that the factor variables are standardized, i.e.

≪

E[Sj] = 0 and var[Sj] = 1,

j = 1, . . . , k.

(2.3)

The S1, . . . , Sk may be stochastically dependent, but they do not have do be.

•

The random variables ξ1, . . . , ξn are the idiosyncratic risk drivers. They are also standard-
ized, i.e.

E[ξi] = 0

and var[ξi] = 1,

i = 1, . . . , n.

(2.4)

ξ1, . . . , ξn, (S1, . . . , Sk) are stochastically independent. As a consequence, conditional on
(S1, . . . , Sk), the default events Di, i = 1, . . . , n are independent.

•

The constants ρi,j, i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , k are the factor loadings of the systematic
factors. We assume that

The constant ti, i = 1, . . . , n is called default threshold. It can be thought as a critical loss
in value of borrower i’s assets that causes the borrower to default on asset i. It is common
to derive ti from borrower i’s (assumed to be known) probability of default pi. Hence, we
determine ti such that

Assuming conditional independence of the default events, given the realizations of the system-
atic factors, entails by the law of large numbers that the loss variable ˜L(u) can be reasonably
approximated by a modiﬁed loss variable ˜˜L(u). The approximate loss variable ˜˜L(u) then de-
pends on the systematic factor only (cf. Gordy, 2003; Lucas et al., 2001). This is interpreted as
elimination of the idiosyncratic risk by diversiﬁcation. In general, the quality of the approxima-
tion depends on conditions like the number of credit assets in the portfolio, the granularity of
the portfolio, or the correlations of the asset value changes with the systematic factors. ˜˜L(u)
is obtained from ˜L(u) by replacing the default indicators 1Di with their best predictors given
(S1, . . . , Sk)]. Hence ˜˜L(u) is
the systematic factors, i.e. with the conditional probabilities P[Di
given by

Note that Gordy’s (2003) ASRF (Asymptotic Single Risk Factor) model is a special case of (2.8)

S is known
In case that an explicit representation of the conditional distribution of S1 given
(e.g. if S is jointly normally distributed), Equation (2.12a) (with F = 1) yields a more eﬃcient
way to calculate the distribution function of L(u) than Corollary 2.4 does. The reason is that
application of Corollary 2.4 would require evaluation of a k-dimensional integral if S had a
density, whereas the application of the following Proposition 2.5 would only require evaluation

Quantiles at high levels (e.g. 99.9%) are popular metrics for determining the economic capital
of portfolios. Within the ﬁnancial community, the α-quantile of a loss distribution is commonly
called Value-at-Risk (VaR) at level α. In case of the generalized loss variable L(u) we write

qα(L(u)) = qα(u).

(2.15b)

The quantiles of L(u) can be computed by numerical inversion of (2.14).

We conclude this section by providing two alternative formulae for the calculation of another
popular risk measure, the Expected Shortfall5, in the case of the asymptotic multi-factor model
under consideration.

Remark 2.6 The Expected Shortfall ESα(L(u)) = E[L(u)

3 Computing the risk contributions

When economic capital for a portfolio is determined by means of a homogeneous risk measure,
by the Euler allocation principle the risk contributions of assets should be calculated as partial
derivatives of the portfolio-wide economic capital with respect to the exposures. In this section
we ﬁrst recall the Euler principle and derive then formulae for the derivatives of Value-at-Risk6
as deﬁned by (2.15a) and Expected Shortfall as deﬁned in Remark 2.6 in the context of the
asymptotic multi-factor model of Section 2.

3.1 Euler allocation

Suppose that real-valued random variables X1, . . . , Xn are given that stand for the proﬁts and
losses with the assets in a portfolio. Let Y denote the portfolio-wide proﬁt and loss, i.e. let

The economic capital EC required by the portfolio is determined with a risk measure ̺, i.e.

Y =

Xi.

n

i=1
X

EC = ̺(Y ).

(3.1)

(3.2)

Deﬁnition 3.1 If ̺ is a risk measure and V, W are random variables such that the derivative
d
dh ̺(h V + W )
h=0 exists, then
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

̺(h V + W )

W ) =

̺(V

|

is called contribution of V to the risk of W in respect of ̺.

h=0

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Assumption 3.2 The risk measure ̺ is positively homogeneous, i.e.

for any random variable Z in the deﬁnition set of ̺ and h > 0.

6See Mausser and Rosen (2004) and the references therein for the practical issues when estimating VaR con-

tributions from statistical samples.

̺(h Z) = h ̺(Z)

If for every i the contribution of Xi to the risk of Y exists, then we have by Euler’s theorem on
the representation of positively homogenous functions

n

̺(Y ) =

̺(Xi

Y ).

(3.3)

The decomposition of the portfolio risk ̺ as given by (3.3) is called Euler allocation. The use of
the Euler allocation principle was justiﬁed by several authors with diﬀerent reasonings:

•

•

•

•

Patrik et al. (1999) argued from a practitioner’s view emphasizing mainly the fact that
the risk contributions according to the Euler principle by (3.3) naturally add up to the
portfolio-wide economic capital.

Litterman (1996) and Tasche (1999) pointed out that the Euler principle is fully compatible
with economically sensible portfolio diagnostics and optimization.

Denault (2001) derived the Euler principle by game-theoretic considerations.

More recently Kalkbrener (2005) presented an axiomatic approach to capital allocation and
risk contributions. One of his axioms requires that risk contributions do not exceed the
corresponding stand-alone risks. From this axiom in connection with more technical condi-
tions, in the context of sub-additive and positively homogeneous risk measures, Kalkbrener
concluded that the Euler principle is the only allocation principle to be compatible with
the “no excession”-axiom (see also Kalkbrener et al., 2004; Tasche, 2002).

3.2 Partial derivatives of VaR and ES

Before coming to the main result on the partial derivatives of VaR with respect to the exposures
of the assets in the portfolio, we will shortly discuss the case of Gordy’s (2003) ASRF model.

Example 3.3 In Gordy’s (2003) ASRF model Equation (2.10) reads

L(u) =

uj gj(X),

(3.4)

j=1
X
where X stands for a standard normally distributed random variable, the single systematic factor,
and the gj are strictly decreasing and continuous functions. As a consequence, the terms gj(X)
in (3.4) are comonotonic random variables. From the comonotonic additivity of VaR and ES
(see, e.g., Tasche, 2002) follows then for any α

(0, 1) that

qα(u) =

uj qα(gj(X))

(3.5a)

E[L(u)

qα(u)] =

uj E[gj(X)

gj (X)

qα(gj(X))].

(3.5b)

|

≥

|

≥

n

j=1
X

As the right-hand sides of (3.5a) and (3.5b) are linear in the exposure vector u, applying the
Euler allocation principle with partial derivatives with respect to the components of u yields
that the risk contributions to VaR or ES in the ASRF model model equal the corresponding
stand-alone risks.

In the following we compute the derivatives of VaR and ES in the context of an asymptotic
multi-factor model as given by (2.10). The validity of the results is subject to technical conditions
similar to those of Tasche (1999, Section 5). For reasons of readability of the text we do not
discuss these conditions here in detail.

Write again qα(u) for qα(L(u))) and (slightly modifying the notation from (2.11b) but keeping

certain expectations conditional on the portfolio loss equalling VaR.

Remark 3.7 At ﬁrst sight, formulae (3.11) and (3.13) look very much like corresponding for-
mulae for the derivatives of VaR and ES in Gouri´eroux et al. (2000), Lemus (1999), and Tasche
(1999). Note, however, that those formulae were not derived in an asymptotic multi-factor set-
ting like the ones here. On the other hand, the validity of the results by Gouri´eroux et al. (2000),
Lemus (1999), and Tasche (1999) is not restricted to the case of bounded loss variables of the
assets. Therefore, the results from this paper and the earlier results complement each other.

4 Deﬁning a diversiﬁcation index

During the last few years three properties of risk measures ̺ turned out to be potentially most
important:

•

Positive homogeneity. See Assumption 3.2 for the formal deﬁnition. This assumption
seems very natural as long as the asset or sub-portfolio under consideration does not
dominate the portfolio and is not subject to liquidity risk. Moreover, by (3.3), positive
homogeneity implies that, within a portfolio, the risk contributions add up to the total
risk. This additivity property is of high practical importance.

•

Sub-additivity. Sub-additivity of a positively homogeneous risk measures is equivalent
to the property that risk contributions are not larger than the corresponding stand-alone

13

risks. Speaking in terms of Sub-section 3.1,

̺(V + W )

̺(V ) + ̺(W ) for all V, W

̺(V

W )

̺(V ) for all V, W,

(4.1)

≤

⇔

|

≤

if ̺ is positively homogeneous (Tasche, 2002, Proposition 2.5).

•

Comonotonic additivity. Random variables V and W are called comonotonic if they
can be represented as non-decreasing functions of a third random variable Z, i.e.

V = hV (Z) and W = hW (Z)

(4.2a)

for some non-decreasing functions hV , hW . As comonotonicity is implied if V and W are
correlated with correlation coeﬃcient 1, it generalizes the concept of linear dependence. A
risk measure ̺ is called comonotonic additive if for any comonotonic random variables V
and W

̺(V + W ) = ̺(V ) + ̺(W ).

(4.2b)

Thus comonotonic additivity can be interpreted as a speciﬁcation of the worst case sce-
narios for the sub-additivity (4.1): nothing worse can occur than comonotonic random
variables – which seems quite natural.

Note that VaR is positively homogeneous and comonotonic additive but not sub-additive and
that ES is positively homogeneous, comonotonic additive and sub-additive (see, e.g. Tasche,
2002). As a consequence, ﬁnding worst case scenarios for given marginal distributions of V, W
in (4.1) is easy in case of ES (take the comonotonic scenario) and non-trivial in case of VaR (see
Embrechts et al., 2003; Luciano and Marena, 2003).

As for positively homogeneous, comonotonic additive and sub-additive risk measures nothing
worse than the comonotonic case can happen, it seems natural9 to measure diversiﬁcation by
comparison with the comonotonic scenario. This suggests the following deﬁnition10.

Deﬁnition 4.1 Let X1, . . . , Xn be real-valued random variables and let Y =
risk measure such that ̺(Y ), ̺(X1), . . . , ̺(Xn) are deﬁned, then

n

̺(Xi)

with ̺(Xi
index of sub-portfolio Xi with respect to the risk measure ̺.

|

Y ) being the risk contribution of Xi as in Deﬁnition 3.1 denotes the diversiﬁcation

9Martin and Tasche (2005) suggest another approach to measuring diversiﬁcation as they calculate the pro-

portions of systematic and idiosyncratic risk within the total risk of the portfolio.

10Without calling the concept “diversiﬁcation index”, Memmel and Wehn (2005) calculate a diversiﬁcation

index for the German supervisor’s market price risk portfolio.

14

If ̺ is sub-additive and positively homogeneous, then by (4.1) both DI̺(Y ) and DI̺(Xi
Y ) will
be bounded by 1. If ̺ is additionally comonotonic additive, then the bound 1 can be reached
by portfolios with comonotonic risks. Thus, with a reasonable risk measure, DI̺(Y ) being close
to 1 will indicate that there is no signiﬁcant diversiﬁcation in the portfolio. Similarly, a value of
DI̺(Xi

Y ) close to 1 will indicate that there is almost no diversiﬁcation eﬀect with asset i.

|

|

Note that VaR by practical experience can be considered an almost sub-additive risk measure
(but see Kalkbrener et al., 2004, for an example of a sub-additivity violation from practice). In
the following section we will illustrate the use of the diversiﬁcation indices from Deﬁnition 4.1
by a numerical example.

5 Numerical example

In this section, we illustrate the application of the formulae for the loss distribution function
(Proposition 2.5) and the risk contributions to VaR (Theorem 3.4) with a simple example. We
consider a special case of model (2.10) with two independent normally distributed systematic
factors and normally distributed idiosyncratic risk drivers as in Example 2.1.

We assume that all but one of the assets are exposed to the ﬁrst systematic factor only. Only one
asset in the portfolio has additionally got an exposure to the second systematic factor. By varying
the extent of this exposure to the second systematic factor we will obtain a dynamic picture of
the eﬀect of diversiﬁcation by dependence on more than one systematic factors. Additionally, we
will ﬁx the exposure to the second systematic factor but vary the weights of the assets within
the portfolio in order to get an impression of the dynamics of the diversiﬁcation indices deﬁned
in Section 4.

Note that our example model can be considered a special case of segmentation, as there is one
segment of assets with exposure to the ﬁrst systematic factor only and another (degenerated to
a single asset) segment with exposure to both systematic factors.

Example 5.1 Consider the loss variable ˜˜L(u) from Example 2.1 with independent standard
normally distributed systematic factors S1 and S2 and independent (also of (S1, S2)) standard
normally distributed idiosyncratic risk drivers ξ1, . . . , ξn. We consider the case of relative (to the
total exposure) loss, i.e. the case

n
i=1 ui = 1. Additionally we assume

so that all assets have the same probability of default. With respect to the correlations with the
systematic factors, we ﬁx some ̺

(0, 1) and let

i = 1, . . . , n,

The square-root representation in (5.2a) and (5.2b) was chosen in order to make the correlations
272). w = 1 means that we are in a single factor
comparable in size with those from BCBS (2004,
§
model, whereas w = 0 implies that the default indicator of the ﬁrst asset is independent from
the rest of the portfolio. Note that due to the almost homogeneous structure of the portfolio
under consideration the approximate loss variable ˜˜L(u) obtains a relatively simple form, not
depending any longer on n, namely

˜˜L(u) = u Φ

Since by independence of S1 and S2 the random variables S1 and √w S1 + √1
w S2 are both
standard normally distributed, both random parts of ˜˜L(u) are identically distributed. This way,
we ensure that in the example all observed diﬀerences in VaR or in the risk contributions are
due to the factor structure only.

For the ﬁrst calculations we choose

p = 0.1,

̺ = 0.1,

u = 0.1.

(5.4)

This choice is mainly driven by the desire to come up with illustrative results. Nevertheless,
the values from (5.4) are not too far away from reality, as 10% probability of default may be
observed in some retail credit portfolios. The value 10% for ̺ is somewhere in the center of
the span provided by BCBS (2004). A 10% weight for a single asset might appear quite high.
However, this single asset could be seen as having been created from a non-degenerated portfolio
segment by transition to the limit in the sense of (2.8).

In order to assess the impact of factor diversiﬁcation at portfolio level, ﬁrst we calculate11 VaR-
ﬁgures at diﬀerent levels both for the single factor model as in (5.3) with w = 1 as well as for the
two factor model with w = 0. Table 1 shows that the impact even in the case of an independent
second factor and for high levels of VaR remains limited.

This picture changes dramatically if we consider UL contributions with respect to VaR instead
of total UL. “UL” means “unexpected loss” and is deﬁned by choosing

̺(V ) = VaRα(V )

E[V ] = qα(V )

E[V ] = UL(V )

−

−

(5.5)

in Deﬁnition 3.1. In Figure 1 we plot the relative contribution to UL with respect to 99.9%-VaR
of the ﬁrst asset in the model in Example 5.1 against the extent of the asset’s exposure to the
ﬁrst factor (low values of w correspond to low exposure, values of w close to 1 correspond to high
exposure). It turns out that the size of the risk contribution of the ﬁrst asset can be reduced

11The more intricate calculations for this paper were conducted by means of the statistics software package R

(cf. R Development Core Team, 2003).

Exposure to 1st factor as fraction of correlation

In order to illustrate the functioning of the diversiﬁcation indices deﬁned in Section 4 we ﬁx the
exposure of the ﬁrst asset to the second factor by setting w = 0.5. We then make the weight u
(see (5.3)) of the ﬁrst asset in the portfolio move from 0% to 100%. We do so with two diﬀerent
values for the probability of default p of the ﬁrst asset. First, we choose the same parameter
setting as in (5.4). Then we change the value of p to 0.2. Figure 2 shows that the portfolio-wide
diversiﬁcation index identiﬁes a most diversiﬁed portfolio. In case of the fully symmetric setting

17

of (5.4) the most diversiﬁed portfolio is the one where the weights of the two assets are equal.
When the probability of default of the ﬁrst asset is changed to a higher value – 20% – the weight
of the ﬁrst asset in the most diversiﬁed allocation is reduced to a value signiﬁcantly less than
50% – as should be expected.

Exposure to 1st asset as fraction of total exposure

Figure 3 illustrates the connection between the two diversiﬁcation indices from Deﬁnition 4.1.
The solid line is – up to the scaling – identical to the dashed line in Figure 2, showing again the
portfolio-wide diversiﬁcation index of the loss variable from (5.3). The dashed line in Figure 3
reﬂects the corresponding risk contribution-based diversiﬁcation index of the ﬁrst asset. From
the deﬁnition of the risk contribution by means of a derivative (see Deﬁnition 3.1) follows that
the two lines intersect at just the weight of the ﬁrst asset that yields the most diversiﬁed
portfolio. According to Figure 3, well-diversiﬁed portfolios are those portfolios where portfolio-
wide and risk contribution-based diversiﬁcation indices are close together. A wide range of the
diversiﬁcation indices of a portfolio indicates that the portfolio is not very well diversiﬁed.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we have derived explicit formulae for risk contributions to VaR and ES in the
context of asymptotic multi-factor models, thus generalizing the capital requirements as provided
by the Basel II Accord in the context of the ASRF (Asymptotic Single Risk Factor) model. The
eﬀort needed for the numerical calculations is higher than in the ASRF case but, as a numerical
example shows, remains feasible at least in the case of two-factor models. The example also
indicates that the eﬀect of factor diversiﬁcation on portfolio-wide economic capital is moderate
but can be signiﬁcant for risk contributions of single assets or sub-portfolios.

The risk contributions we analyze in the ﬁrst sections of the paper can be used for calculating
diversiﬁcation indices for sub-portfolios or assets in a portfolio. If these indices, considered for
all the assets in the portfolio, take a wide range, then there is a high potential for diversiﬁcation
in the portfolio. If, in contrast, the range of the indices is narrow, there is no potential left
for diversiﬁcation by changing the weights of the assets in the portfolio. In this case, more
diversiﬁcation can be only reached by adding new assets or by removing assets from the portfolio.

This observation suggests the use of the newly developed diversiﬁcation indices for reﬂecting
factor diversiﬁcation: assets found well-diversiﬁed by an index close to the portfolio-wide index
could receive a reduction of capital requirements. The sizes of such reductions could be estimated
by means of an asymptotic two-factor model. Of course, the concrete choice of the model and
its underlying parameters might have a strong impact on the estimates. Further research in this
direction seems necessary.

Abstract

A large consensus now seems to take for granted that the distributions of empirical returns
of ﬁnancial time series are regularly varying, with a tail exponent b close to 3. First, we show
by synthetic tests performed on time series with time dependence in the volatility with both
Pareto and Stretched-Exponential distributions that for sample of moderate size, the standard
generalized extreme value (GEV) estimator is quite inefﬁcient due to the possibly slow con-
vergence toward the asymptotic theoretical distribution and the existence of biases in presence
of dependence between data. Thus it cannot distinguish reliably between rapidly and regularly
varying classes of distributions. The Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) estimator works
better, but still lacks power in the presence of strong dependence. Then, we use a paramet-
ric representation of the tail of the distributions of returns of 100 years of daily return of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average and over 1 years of 5-minutes returns of the Nasdaq Composite
index, encompassing both a regularly varying distribution in one limit of the parameters and
rapidly varying distributions of the class of the Stretched-Exponential (SE) and Log-Weibull
distributions in other limits. Using the method of nested hypothesis testing (Wilks’ theorem),
we conclude that both the SE distributions and Pareto distributions provide reliable descrip-
tions of the data and cannot be distinguished for sufﬁciently high thresholds. However, the
exponent b of the Pareto increases with the quantiles and its growth does not seem exhausted
for the highest quantiles of three out of the four tail distributions investigated here. Correl-
atively, the exponent c of the SE model decreases and seems to tend to zero. Based on the
discovery that the SE distribution tends to the Pareto distribution in a certain limit such that
the Pareto (or power law) distribution can be approximated with any desired accuracy on an
arbitrary interval by a suitable adjustment of the parameters of the SE distribution, we demon-
strate that Wilks’ test of nested hypothesis still works for the non-exactly nested comparison
between the SE and Pareto distributions. The SE distribution is found signiﬁcantly better over
the whole quantile range but becomes unnecessary beyond the 95% quantiles compared with
the Pareto law. Similar conclusions hold for the log-Weibull model with respect to the Pareto
distribution. Summing up all the evidence provided by our battery of tests, it seems that the
tails ultimately decay slower than any SE but probably faster than power laws with reason-
able exponents. Thus, from a practical view point, the log-Weibull model, which provides a

1

smooth interpolation between SE and PD, can be considered as an appropriate approximation
of the sample distributions. We ﬁnally discuss the implications of our results on the “moment
condition failure” and for risk estimation and management.

1 Motivation of the study

The determination of the precise shape of the tail of the distribution of returns is a major issue both
from a practical and from an academic point of view. For practitioners, it is crucial to accurately
estimate the low value quantiles of the distribution of returns (proﬁt and loss) because they are
involved in almost all the modern risk management methods. From an academic perspective, many
economic and ﬁnancial theories rely on a speciﬁc parameterization of the distributions whose
parameters are intended to represent the “macroscopic” variables the agents are sensitive to.

The distribution of returns is one of the most basic characteristics of the markets and many papers
have been devoted to it. Contrarily to the average or expected return, for which economic the-
ory provides guidelines to assess them in relation with risk premium, ﬁrm size or book-to-market
equity (see for instance Fama and French (1996)), the functional form of the distribution of re-
turns, and especially of extreme returns, is much less constrained and still a topic of active debate.
Naively, the central limit theorem would lead to a Gaussian distribution for sufﬁciently large time
intervals over which the return is estimated. Taking the continuous time limit such that any ﬁnite
time interval is seen as the sum of an inﬁnite number of increments thus leads to the paradigm
of log-normal distributions of prices and equivalently of Gaussian distributions of returns, based
on the pioneering work of Bachelier (1900) later improved by Samuelson (1965). The log-normal
paradigm has been the starting point of many ﬁnancial theories such as Markovitz (1959)’s port-
folio selection method, Sharpe (1964)’s market equilibrium model or Black and Scholes (1973)’s
rational option pricing theory. However, for real ﬁnancial data, the convergence in distribution to a
Gaussian law is very slow (Campbell et al. 1997, Bouchaud and Potters 2000, for instance), much
slower than predicted for independent returns. As table 1 shows, the excess kurtosis (which is
zero for a normal distribution) remains large even for monthly returns, testifying (i) of signiﬁcant
deviations from normality, (ii) of the heavy tail behavior of the distributions of returns and (iii) of
signiﬁcant dependences between returns (Campbell et al. 1997).

Another idea rooted in economic theory consists in invoking the “Gibrat principle” (Simon 1957)
initially used to account for the growth of cities and of wealth through a mechanism combining
stochastic multiplicative and additive noises (Levy et al. 1996, Sornette and Cont 1997, Biham et
al. 1998, Sornette 1998) leading to a Pareto distribution of sizes (Champernowne 1953, Gabaix
1999). Rational bubble models a la Blanchard and Watson (1982) can also be cast in this math-
ematical framework of stochastic recurrence equations and leads to distribution with power law
tails, albeit with a strong constraint on the tail exponent (Lux and Sornette 2002, Malevergne and
Sornette 2001). These frameworks suggest that an alternative and natural way to capture the heavy
tail character of the distributions of returns is to use distributions with power-like tails (Pareto,
Generalized Pareto, stable laws) or more generally, regularly-varying distributions (Bingham et
al. 1987) 1, the later encompassing all the former.

In the early 1960s, Mandelbrot (1963) and Fama (1965) presented evidence that distributions of
returns can be well approximated by a symmetric L´evy stable law with tail index b about 1.7.
These estimates of the power tail index have recently been conﬁrmed by Mittnik et al. (1998),
and slightly different indices of the stable law (b = 1.4) were suggested by Mantegna and Stan-
ley (1995, 2000). On the other hand, there are numerous evidences of a larger value of the tail
index b ∼= 3 (Longin 1996, Guillaume et al. 1997, Gopikrishnan et al. 1998, Gopikrishnan et
al. 1999, Plerou et al. 1999, M¨uller et al. 1998, Farmer 1999, Lux 2000). See also the various
alternative parameterizations in term of the Student distribution (Blattberg and Gonnedes 1974,

Kon 1984), or Pearson type-VII distributions (Nagahara and Kitagawa 1999), which all have an
asymptotic power law tail and are regularly varying. Thus, a general conclusion of this group of
authors concerning tail fatness can be formulated as follows: tails of the distribution of returns are
heavier than a Gaussian tail and heavier than an exponential tail; they certainly admit the existence
of a ﬁnite variance (b > 2), whereas the existence of the third (skewness) and the fourth (kurtosis)
moments is questionable.

These apparent contradictory results actually do not apply to the same quantiles of the distributions
of returns. Indeed, Mantegna and Stanley (1995) have shown that the distribution of returns can
be described accurately by a L´evy law only within a limited range of perhaps up to 4 standard
deviations, while a faster decay of the distribution is observed beyond. This almost-but-not-quite
L´evy stable description explains (in part) the slow convergence of the returns distribution to the
Gaussian law under time aggregation (Sornette 2000). And it is precisely outside this range where
the L´evy law applies that a tail index of about three have been estimated. This can be seen from
the fact that most authors who have reported a tail index b ∼= 3 have used some optimality criteria
for choosing the sample fractions (i.e., the largest values) for the estimation of the tail index. Thus,
unlike the authors supporting stable laws, they have used only a fraction of the largest (positive
tail) and smallest (negative tail) sample values.

It would thus seem that all has been said on the distributions of returns. However, there are dissent-
ing views in the literature. Indeed, the class of regularly varying distributions is not the sole one
able to account for the large kurtosis and fat-tailness of the distributions of returns. Some recent
works suggest alternative descriptions for the distributions of returns. For instance, Gouri´eroux
and Jasiak (1998) claim that the distribution of returns on the French stock market decays faster
than any power law. Cont et al. (1997) have proposed to use exponentially truncated stable dis-
tributions, Barndorff-Nielsen (1997), Eberlein et al. (1998) and Prause (1998) have respectively
considered normal inverse Gaussian and (generalized) hyperbolic distributions, which asymptoti-
cally decay as xa
b x), while Laherr`ere and Sornette (1999) suggest to ﬁt the distributions
of stock returns by the Stretched-Exponential (SE) law. These results, challenging the traditional
hypothesis of power-like tail, offer a new representation of the returns distributions and need to be
tested rigorously on a statistical ground.

A priori, one could assert that Longin (1996)’s results should rule out the exponential and Stretched-
Exponential hypotheses. Indeed, his results, based on extreme value theory, show that the distri-
butions of log-returns belong to the maximum domain of attraction of the Fr´echet distribution, so
that they are necessarily regularly varying power-like laws. However, his study, like almost all
others on this subject, has been performed under the assumption that (1) ﬁnancial time series are
made of independent and identically distributed returns and (2) the corresponding distributions
of returns belong to one of only three possible maximum domains of attraction. However, these
assumptions are not fulﬁlled in general. While Smith (1985)’s results indicate that the dependence
of the data does not constitute a major problem in the limit of large samples, we shall see that it
can signiﬁcantly bias standard statistical methods for samples of size commonly used in extreme
tails studies. Moreover, Longin’s conclusions are essentially based on an aggregation procedure
which stresses the central part of the distribution while smoothing the characteristics of the tail,
which are essential in characterizing the tail behavior.

In addition, real ﬁnancial time series exhibit GARCH effects (Bollerslev 1986, Bollerslev et
al. 1994) leading to heteroscedasticity and to clustering of high threshold exceedances due to a
long memory of the volatility. These rather complex dependent structures make difﬁcult if not
questionable the blind application of standard statistical tools for data analysis. In particular, the
existence of signiﬁcant dependence in the return volatility leads to the existence of a signiﬁcant

4

bias and an increase of the true standard deviation of the statistical estimators of tail indices. In-
deed, there are now many examples showing that dependences and long memories as well as non-
linearities mislead standard statistical tests (Andersson et al. 1999, Granger and Ter¨asvirta 1999,
for instance). Consider the Hill’s and Pickand’s estimators, which play an important role in the
study of the tails of distributions. It is often overlooked that, for dependent time series, Hill’s es-
timator remains only consistent but not asymptotically efﬁcient (Rootzen et al. 1998). Moreover,
for ﬁnancial time series with a dependence structure described by a IGARCH process, Kearns and
Pagan (1997) have shown that the standard deviation of Hill’s estimator obtained by a bootstrap
method can be seven to eight time larger than the standard deviation derived under the asymptotic
normality assumption. These ﬁgures are even worse for Pickand’s estimator.

The question then arises whether the many results and seemingly almost consensus obtained by
ignoring the limitations of usual statistical tools could have led to erroneous conclusions about
the tail behavior of the distributions of returns. Here, we propose to investigate once more this
delicate problem of the tail behavior of distributions of returns in order to shed new lights 2. To
this aim, we investigate two time series: the daily returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJ) Index over a century (kindly provided by Prof. H.-C. G. Bothmer) and the ﬁve-minutes
returns of the Nasdaq Composite index (ND) over one year from April 1997 to May 1998 obtained
from Bloomberg. These two sets of data have been chosen since they are typical of the data sets
used in most previous studies. Their size (about 20, 000 data points), while signiﬁcant compared
with those used in investment and portfolio analysis, is however much smaller than recent data-
intensive studies using ten of millions of data points (Gopikrishnan et al. 1998, Gopikrishnan et
al. 1999, Plerou et al. 1999, Matia et al. 2002, Mizuno et al. 2002).

First, we show by synthetic tests performed on time series with time dependence in the volatil-
ity with both Pareto and Stretched-Exponential distributions that for sample of moderate size, the
standard generalized extreme value (GEV) estimator is quite inefﬁcient due to the possibly slow
convergence toward the asymptotic theoretical distribution and the existence of biases in presence
of dependence between data. Thus it cannot distinguish reliably between rapidly and regularly
varying classes of distributions. The Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) estimator works bet-
ter, but still lacks power in the presence of strong dependence. Then, we use a parametric rep-
resentation of the tail of the distributions of returns of our two time series, encompassing both a
regularly varying distribution in one limit of the parameters and rapidly varying distributions of
the class of the Stretched-Exponential (SE) and Log-Weibull distributions in other limits.

Using the method of nested hypothesis testing (Wilks’ theorem), our second conclusion is that
none of the standard parametric family distributions (Pareto, exponential, stretched-exponential,
incomplete Gamma and Log-Weibull) ﬁts satisfactorily the DJ and ND data on the whole range of
either positive or negative returns. While this is also true for the family of stretched exponential
and the log-Weibull distributions, these families appear to be the best among the ﬁve considered
parametric families, in so far as they are able to ﬁt the data over the largest interval. For the
high quantiles (far in the tails), both the SE distributions and Pareto distributions provide reliable
descriptions of the data and cannot be distinguished for sufﬁciently high thresholds. However, the
exponent b of the Pareto increases with the quantiles and its growth does not seem exhausted for
the highest quantiles of three out of the four tail distributions investigated here. Correlatively, the
exponent c of the SE model decreases and seems to tend to zero

Based on the discovery presented here that the SE distribution tends to the Pareto distribution in a

2Picoli et al. (2003) have also presented ﬁts comparing the relative merits of SE and so-called q-exponentials (which
are similar to Student distribution with power law tails) for the description of the frequency distributions of basketball
baskets, cyclone victims, brand-name drugs by retail sales, and highway length.

certain limit such that the Pareto (or power law) distribution can be approximated with any desired
accuracy on an arbitrary interval by a suitable adjustment of the parameters of the SE distribution,
we demonstrate that Wilks’ test of nested hypothesis still works for the non-exactly nested com-
parison between the SE and Pareto distributions. The SE distribution is found signiﬁcantly better
over the whole quantile range but becomes unnecessary beyond the 95% quantiles compared with
the Pareto law. The log-Weibull model seems to be a good candidate since it provides a smooth
interpolation between the SE and PD models. The log-Weibull distribution is at least as good as
the Stretched-Exponential model, on a large range of data, but again, the Pareto distribution is
ultimately the most parsimonious.

Collectively, these results suggest that the extreme tails of the true distribution of returns of our two
data sets are fatter that any stretched-exponential, strictly speaking -i.e., with a strickly positive
fractional exponent- but thinner than any power law. Thus, notwithstanding our best efforts, we
cannot conclude on the exact nature of the far-tail of distributions of returns.

As already mentioned, other works have proposed the so-called inverse-cubic law (b = 3) based
on the analysis of distributions of returns of high-frequency data aggregated over hundreds up to
thousands of stocks. This aggregating procedure leads to novel problems of interpretation. We
think that the relevant question for most practical applications is not to determine what is the
true asymptotic tail but what is the best effective description of the tails in the domain of useful
applications. As we shall show below, it may be that the extreme asymptotic tail is a regularly
varying function with tail index b = 3 for daily returns, but this is not very useful if this tail
describes events whose recurrence time is a century or more. Our present work must thus be
gauged as an attempt to provide a simple efﬁcient effective description of the tails of distribution
of returns covering most of the range of interest for practical applications. We feel that the efforts
requested to go deeper in the tails beyond the tails analyzed here, while of great interest from a
scientiﬁc point of view to potentially help unravel market mechanisms, may be too artiﬁcial and
unreachable to have signiﬁcant applications.

The paper is organized as follows.

The next section is devoted to the presentation of our two data sets and to some of their basic
statistical properties, emphasizing their fat tailed behavior. We discuss, in particular, the impor-
tance of the so-called “lunch effect” for the tail properties of intra-day returns. We then obtain
the well-known presence of a signiﬁcant temporal dependence structure and study the possible
non-stationary character of these time series.

Section 3 attempts to account for the temporal dependence of our time series and investigates its
effect on the determination of the extreme behavior of the tails of the distribution of returns. In
this goal, we build a simple long memory stochastic volatility process whose stationary distribu-
tions are by construction either asymptotically regularly varying or exponential. We show that,
due to the time dependence on the volatility, the estimation with standard statistical estimators
may become unreliable due to the signiﬁcant bias and increase of the standard deviation of these
estimators. These results justify our re-examination of previous claims of regularly varying tails.

To ﬁt our two data sets, section 4 proposes two general parametric representations of the distribu-
tion of returns encompassing both a regularly varying distribution in one limit of the parameters
and rapidly varying distributions of the class of stretched exponential and log-Weibull distribu-
tions in another limit. The use of regularly varying distributions have been justiﬁed above. From
a theoretical view point, the class of stretched exponentials is motivated in part by the fact that the
large deviations of multiplicative processes are generically distributed with stretched exponential
distributions (Frisch and Sornette 1997). Stretched exponential distributions are also parsimonious

6

examples of the important subset of sub-exponentials, that is, of the general class of distributions
decaying slower than an exponential. This class of sub-exponentials share several important prop-
erties of heavy-tailed distributions (Embrechts et al. 1997), not shared by exponentials or distribu-
tions decreasing faster than exponentials. The interest of the log-Weibull comes from the smooth
interpolation it provides between any Stretched-Exponential and any Pareto distributions.

The descriptive power of these different hypotheses are compared in section 5. We ﬁrst con-
sider nested hypotheses and use Wilks’ test to compare each distribution (Pareto, Exponential,
Gamma and Stretched Exponential) with the most general parameterization which encompasses
all of them. It appears that both the stretched-exponential and the Pareto distributions are the best
and most parsimonious models compatible with the data with a slight advantage in favor of the
stretched exponential model. Then, in order to directly compare the descriptive power of these two
models, we use the important remark that, in a certain limit where the exponent c of the stretched
exponential pdf goes to zero, the stretched exponential pdf tends to the Pareto distribution. Thus,
the Pareto (or power law) distribution can be approximated with any desired accuracy on an ar-
bitrary interval by a suitable adjustment of the parameters of the stretched exponential pdf. This
allows us to demonstrate in Appendix D that Wilks’ test also applies to this non-exactly nested
comparison between the SE and Pareto models. We ﬁnd that the SE distribution is signiﬁcantly
better over the whole quantile range but becomes unnecessary beyond the 95% quantiles compared
with the Pareto law. Similar results are found for the comparison of the Log-Weibull versus the
Pareto distributions.

Section 6 summarizes our results and presents the conclusions of our study for risk management
purposes.

2 Some basic statistical features

2.1 The data

We use two sets of data. The ﬁrst sample consists in the daily returns3 of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average Index (DJ) over the time interval from May 27, 1896 to May 31, 2000, which represents
a sample size n = 28415. The second data set contains the high-frequency (5 minutes) returns of
Nasdaq Composite (ND) index for the period from April 8, 1997 to May 29, 1998 which represents
n=22123 data points. The choice of these two data sets is justiﬁed by their similarity with (1) the
data set of daily returns used by Longin (1996) particularly and (2) the high frequency data used
by Guillaume et al. (1997), Lux (2000), M¨uller et al. (1998) among others.

For the intra-day Nasdaq data, there are two caveats that must be addressed. First, in order to
remove the effect of overnight price jumps, we have determined the returns separately for each of
289 days contained in the Nasdaq data and have taken the union of all these 289 return data sets
to obtain a global return data set. Second, the volatility of intra-day data are known to exhibit a
U-shape, also called “lunch-effect”, that is, an abnormally high volatility at the begining and the
end of the trading day compared with a low volatility at the approximate time of lunch. Such effect
is present in our data, as depicted on ﬁgure 1, where the average absolute returns are shown as a
function of the time within a trading day. It is desirable to correct the data from this systematic
effect. This has been performed by renormalizing the 5 minutes-returns at a given moment of the
trading day by the corresponding average absolute return at the same moment. We shall refer to

3Throughout the paper, we will use compound returns, i.e., log-returns.

7

this time series as the corrected Nasdaq returns in contrast with the raw (incorrect) Nasdaq returns
and we shall examine both data sets for comparison.

The Dow Jones daily returns also exhibit some non-stationarity. Indeed, one can observe a clear
excess volatility roughly covering the time of the bubble ending in the October 1929 crash follow-
ing by the Great Depression. To investigate the inﬂuence of such non-stationarity, time interval,
the statistical study exposed below has been performed twice: ﬁrst with the entire sample, and
after having removed the period from 1927 to 1936 from the sample. The results are somewhat
different, but on the whole, the conclusions about the nature of the tail are the same. Thus, only
the results concerning the whole sample will be detailed in the paper.

Although the distributions of positive and negative returns are known to be very similar (Jondeau
and Rockinger 2001, for instance), we have chosen to treat them separately. For the Dow Jones,
this gives us 14949 positive and 13464 negative data points while, for the Nasdaq, we have 11241
positive and 10751 negative data points.

Table 1 summarizes the main statistical properties of these two time series (both for the raw and
for the corrected Nasdaq returns) in terms of the average returns, their standard deviations, the
skewness and the excess kurtosis for four time scales of ﬁve minutes, an hour, one day and one
month. The Dow Jones exhibits a signiﬁcantly negative skewness, which can be ascribed to the
impact of the market crashes. The raw Nasdaq returns are signiﬁcantly positively skewed while the
returns corrected for the “lunch effect” are negatively skewed, showing that the lunch effect plays
an important role in the shaping of the distribution of the intra-day returns. Note also the important
decrease of the kurtosis after correction of the Nasdaq returns for lunch effect, conﬁrming the
strong impact of the lunch effect. In all cases, the excess-kurtosis are high and remains signiﬁcant
even after a time aggregation of one month. The Jarque-Bera’s test (Cromwell et al. 1994), a joint
statistic using skewness and kurtosis coefﬁcients, is used to reject the normality assumption for
these time series.

2.2 Existence of time dependence

It is well-known that ﬁnancial time series exhibit complex dependence structures like heteroscedas-
ticity or non-linearities. These properties are clearly observed in our two times series. For instance,
we have estimated the statistical characteristic V (for positive random variables) called coefﬁcient
of variation

V =

Std(X )
E(X )

,

(1)

which is often used as a testing statistic of the randomness property of a time series. It can be
applied to a sequence of points (or, intervals generated by these points on the line). If these points
are “absolutely random,” that is, generated by a Poissonian ﬂow, then the intervals between them
are distributed according to an exponential distribution for which V = 1. If V << 1, the process is
close to a periodic oscillation. Values V >> 1 are associated with a clustering phenomenon. We
estimated V = V (u) for extrema X > u and X <
u as function of threshold u (both for positive
and for negative extrema). The results are shown in ﬁgure 2 for the Dow Jones daily returns. As
the results are essentially the same for the Nasdaq, we do not show them. Figure 2 shows that, in
95% of the sample, V increases with u, indicating that the
the main range
“clustering” property becomes stronger as the threshold u increases. The coefﬁcient of variation
has also been estimated for the Dow Jones when the time interval from 1927 to 1936 is removed.
Its maximum value decreases by one, but it still signiﬁcantly increases with the threshold u.

We have then applied several formal statistical tests of independence. We have ﬁrst performed
R2 test statistic,

The test has been performed up to q = 10 and, in every case, the null hypothesis is strongly
rejected, at any usual signiﬁcance level. Thus, the time series are heteroskedastic and exhibit
volatility clustering. We have also performed a BDS test (Brock et al. 1987) which allows us to
detect not only volatility clustering, like in the previous test, but also departure from iid-ness due to
non-linearities. Again, we strongly rejects the null-hypothesis of iid data, at any usual signiﬁcance
level, conﬁrming the Lagrange multiplier test.

3 Can long memory processes lead to misleading measures of ex-

treme properties?

Since the descriptive statistics given in the previous section have clearly shown the existence of a
signiﬁcant temporal dependence structure, it is important to consider the possibility that it can lead
to erroneous conclusions on the estimated parameters as previously shown by Kearns and Pagan
(1997) for integrated GARCH processes. We ﬁrst brieﬂy recall the standard procedures used to
investigate extremal properties, stressing the problems and drawbacks arising from the existence
of temporal dependence. We then perform a numerical simulation to study the behavior of the
estimators in presence of dependence. We put particular emphasis on the possible appearance of
signiﬁcant biases due to dependence in the data set. Finally, we present the results on the extremal
properties of our two DJ and ND data sets in the light of the bootstrap results.

3.1 Some theoretical results

Two limit theorems allow one to study the extremal properties and to determine the maximum
domain of attraction (MDA) of a distribution function in two forms.

First, consider a sample of N iid realizations X1, X2,
, XN. Let X ∧ denotes the maximum of this
sample. Then, the Gnedenko theorem states that, if, after an adequate centering and normalization,
the distribution of X ∧ converges to a non-degenerate distribution as N goes to inﬁnity, this limit
distribution is then necessarily the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution deﬁned by

that the existence of non-degenerate limit distribution of properly centered and normalized X ∧ is a
rather strong limitation. There are a lot of distribution functions that do not satisfy this limitation,

Thus, the Generalized Pareto Distribution has a ﬁnite support for x < 0.

The form parameter x
is of paramount importance for the form of the limiting distribution. Its
sign determines three possible limiting forms of the distribution of maxima: If x > 0, then the
limit distribution is the Fr´echet power-like distribution; If x = 0, then the limit distribution is
the Gumbel (double-exponential) distribution; If x < 0, then the limit distribution has a support
bounded from above. All these three distributions are united in eq.(2) by this parameterization.
The determination of the parameter x
is the central problem of extreme value analysis. Indeed, it
allows one to determine the maximum domain of attraction of the underling distribution. When
x > 0, the underlying distribution belongs to the Fr´echet maximum domain of attraction and is
regularly varying (power-like tail). When x = 0, it belongs to the Gumbel Maximum Domain
of Attraction and is rapidly varying (exponential tail), while if x < 0 it belongs to the Weibull
Maximum Domain of Attraction and has a ﬁnite right endpoint.

3.2 Examples of slow convergence to limit GEV and GPD distributions

There exist two ways of estimating x . First, if there is a sample of maxima (taken from sub-samples
of sufﬁciently large size), then one can ﬁt to this sample the GEV distribution, thus estimating
the parameters by Maximum Likelihood method. Alternatively, one can prefer the distribution
of exceedances over a large threshold given by the GPD (7), whose tail index can be estimated
with Pickands’ estimator or by Maximum Likelihood, as previously. Hill’s estimator cannot be
used since it assumes x > 0, while the essence of extreme value analysis is, as we said, to test
for the class of limit distributions without excluding any possibility, and not only to determine
the quantitative value of an exponent. Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks,
especially when one has to study dependent data, as we show below.

Given a sample of size N, one considers the q-maxima drawn from q sub-samples of size p (such
, x ) in (4) by Maximum Likelihood. This procedure
that p
yields consistent and asymptotically Gaussian estimators, provided that x >
1/2 (Smith 1985).

The properties of the estimators still hold approximately for dependent data, provided that the
interdependence of data is weak. However, it is difﬁcult to choose an optimal value of q of the sub-
samples. It depends both on the size N of the entire sample and on the underlying distribution: the
maxima drawn from an Exponential distribution are known to converge very quickly to Gumbel’s
distribution (Hall and Wellnel 1979), while for the Gaussian law, convergence is particularly slow
(Hall 1979).

The second possibility is to estimate the parameter x
from the distribution of exceedances (the
GPD). For this, one can use either the Maximum Likelihood estimator or Pickands’ estimator.
Maximum Likelihood estimators are well-known to be the most efﬁcient ones (at least for x >
1/2 and for independent data) but, in this particular case, Pickands’ estimator works reasonably

In the presence of dependence between data, one can expect an increase of the standard deviation,
as reported by Kearns and Pagan (1997). For time dependence of the GARCH class, Kearns and
Pagan (1997) have indeed demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase of the standard deviation of the
tail index estimator, such as Hill’s estimator, by a factor more than seven with respect to their
asymptotic properties for iid samples. This leads to very inaccurate index estimates for time series
with this kind of temporal dependence.

Another problem lies in the determination of the optimal threshold u of the GPD, which is in fact
related to the optimal determination of the sub-samples size q in the case of the estimation of the
parameters of the distribution of maximum.

In sum, none of these methods seem really satisfying and each one presents severe drawbacks.
The estimation of the parameters of the GEV distribution and of the GPD may be less sensitive to
the dependence of the data, but this property is only asymptotic, thus a bootstrap investigation is
required to be able to compare the real power of each estimation method for samples of moderate
size.

As a ﬁrst simple example illustrating the possibly very slow convergence to the limit distributions
of extreme value theory mentioned above, let us consider a simulated sample of iid Weibull random
variables (we thus fulﬁll the most basic assumption of extreme values theory, i.e, iid-ness). We
take two values for the exponent of the Weibull distribution: c = 0.7 and c = 0.3, with d = 1
(scale parameter). An estimation of x by the distribution of the GPD of exceedance should give
estimated values of x close to zero in the limit of large N. In order to use the GPD, we have taken
the conditional Weibull distribution under condition X > Uk, k = 1...15, where the thresholds Uk
are chosen as: U1 = 0.1; U2 = 0.3; U3 = 1; U4 = 3; U5 = 10; U6 = 30; U7 = 100; U8 = 300; U9 =
1000; U10 = 3000; U11 = 104; U12 = 3

104; U13 = 105; U14 = 3

105 and U15 = 106.

·

·

For each simulation, the size of the sample above the considered threshold Uk is chosen equal
to 50, 000 in order to get small standard deviations. The Maximum-Likelihood estimates of the
GPD form parameter x are shown in ﬁgure 3. For c = 0.7, the threshold U7 gives an estimate
x = 0.0123 with standard deviation equal to 0.0045, i.e., the estimate for x differs signiﬁcantly

11

¥
¥
from zero (recall that x = 0 is the correct theoretical limit value). This occurs notwithstanding
9,
the huge size of the implied data set; indeed, the probability Pr X > U7 for c = 0.7 is about 10−
so that in order to obtain a data set of conditional samples from an unconditional data set of the
size studied here (50, 000 realizations above U7), the size of such unconditional sample should be
approximately 109 times larger than the number of “peaks over threshold”, i.e., it is practically
impossible to have such a sample. For c = 0.3, the convergence to the theoretical value zero
is even slower.
Indeed, even the largest ﬁnancial datasets for a single asset, drawn from high
frequency data, are no larger than or of the order of one million points4. The situation does not
change even for data sets one or two orders of magnitudes larger as considered in (Gopikrishnan
et al. 1998, Gopikrishnan et al. 1999, Plerou et al. 1999), obtained by aggregating thousands of
stocks5. Thus, although the GPD form parameter should be zero theoretically in the limit of large
sample for the Weibull distribution, this limit cannot be reached for any available sample sizes.

This is a clear illustration that a rapidly varying distribution, like the Weibull distribution with
exponent smaller than one, i.e., a Stretched-Exponential distribution, can be mistaken for a Pareto
or any other regularly varying distribution for any practical applications.

3.3 Generation of a long memory process with a well-deﬁned stationary distribu-

tion

In order to study the performance of the various estimators of the tail index x and the inﬂuence
of interdependence of sample values, we have generated several samples with distinct properties.
The ﬁrst three samples are made of iid realizations drawn respectively from an asymptotic power-
law distribution with tail index b = 3 and from a Stretched-Exponential distribution with exponent
c = 0.3 and c = 0.7. The other samples contain realizations exhibiting different degrees of time
dependence with the same three distributions as for the ﬁrst three samples: a regularly varying
distribution with tail index b = 3 and a Stretched-Exponential distribution with exponent c = 0.3
and c = 0.7. Thus, the three ﬁrst samples are the iid counterparts of the later ones. The sample with
regularly varying iid distributions converges to the Fr´echet’s maximum domain of attraction with
x = 1/3 = 0.33, while the iid Stretched-Exponential distribution converges to Gumbel’s maximum
domain of attraction with x = 0. We now study how well can one distinguish between these two
distributions belonging to two different maximum domains of attraction.

For the stochastic processes with temporal dependence, we use a simple stochastic volatility
model. First, we construct a Markovian Gaussian process
1 whose correlation function
is

Varying a allows us to change the strength of the time dependence, characterized by the correlation
length t =
1
ln a . When a = 0, the iid case is retrieved. In the following, we have chosen a = 0.95
and 0.99, which correspond to correlation lengths of about 20 and 100 lags respectively. For
simplicity, we will refer to the ﬁrst case as the “short-memory” process, while the second one will
be called “long-memory” process. This denomination is only for convenience and does not refer to
the conventional distinction between processes with short and long range memory (Beran 1994).

4One year of data sampled at the 1 minute time scale gives approximately 1.2
5In this case, another issue arises concerning the fact that the aggregation of returns from different assets may distort
the information and the very structure of the tails of the probability density functions (pdf), if they exhibit some intrinsic
variability (Matia et al. 2002).

ture with long memory and uniform marginals. In contrast, if one quantiﬁes the dependence by
the correlation coefﬁcient or the correlation ratio or other reasonable standard measures of de-
pendence, the monotonous change of variable (12) is no more innocuous as the correlation may
become as small as one wants under an suitable choice of a strickly increasing transformation (see
for instance (Malevergne and Sornette 2002) for a detailed discussion of the effect of conditioning
on correlation measures). However, in the present case, we can calculate exactly the correlation

For our purpose, the important point is to obtain a process with the correct asymptotic distribution
tails together with some dependence: this allows us to probe some impact of the dependence on
estimators and show that standard statistical estimators may become unreliable.

In the last step, we deﬁne the volatility process

which ensures that the stationary distribution of the volatility is a Pareto distribution with tail
index b. Such a distribution of the volatility is not realistic in the bulk which is found to be
approximately a lognormal distribution for not too large volatilities (Sornette et al. 2000), but is
in agreement with the hypothesis of an asymptotic regularly varying distribution. A change of
variable more complicated than (16) can provide a more realistic behavior of the volatility on the
entire range of the distribution but our main goal is not to provide a realistic stochastic volatility
model but only to exhibit a stochastic process with time dependence and well-deﬁned prescribed
marginals in order to test the inﬂuence of the dependence structure.

To summarize, starting with a Markovian Gaussian process, we have deﬁned a stochastic pro-
cess characterized by a stationary distribution function of our choice, thanks to the invariance of
the temporal dependence structure (the copula) under strictly increasing change of variable. In
particular, this approach gives stochastic processes with a regularly varying marginal distribution
and with a stretched-exponential distribution. Notwithstanding the difference in their marginals,
these two processes possess by construction exactly the same time dependence. This allows us to
compare the impact of the same dependence on these two classes of marginals.

3.4 Results of numerical simulations

We have generated 1000 replications of each process presented in the previous section, i.e., iid
Stretched-Exponential, iid Pareto, short and long memory processes with a Pareto distribution and
with a Stretched-Exponential distribution. Each sample contains 10, 000 realizations, which is
approximately the number of points in each tail of our real samples.

Panel (a) of table 2 presents the mean values and standard deviations of the Maximum Likeli-
hood estimates of x , using the Generalized Extreme Value distribution and the Generalized Pareto
Distribution for the three samples of iid data. To estimate the parameters of the GEV distribu-
tion and study the inﬂuence of the sub-sample size, we have grouped the data in clusters of size
q = 10, 20, 100 and 200. For the analysis in terms of the GPD, we have considered four different
large thresholds u, corresponding to the quantiles 90%, 95%, 99% and 99.5%. The estimates of x
obtained from the distribution of maxima are compatible (at the 95% conﬁdence level) with the ex-
pected value for the Stretched-Exponential with c = 0.7 for all cluster sizes and for the Pareto dis-
tribution for clusters of size larger than 10. For the Stretched-Exponential with fractional exponent
c = 0.3, we obtain an average value x
larger than 0.2 over the four different sizes of sub-samples.
Except for the largest cluster, this value is signiﬁcantly different from the theoretical value x = 0.0.
This clearly shows that the distribution of the maximum drawn from a Stretched-Exponential dis-
tribution with c = 0.7 converges very quickly toward the theoretical asymptotic GEV distribution,

14

while for c = 0.3 the convergence is extremely slow. Such a fast convergence for c = 0.7 is not
surprising since, for this value of the fractional index, the Stretched-Exponential distribution re-
mains close to the Exponential distribution, which is known to converge very quickly to the GEV
distribution (Hall and Wellnel 1979). For c = 0.3, the Stretched-Exponential distribution behaves,
over a wide range, like the power law - as we shall see in the next section - thus it is not surprising
to obtain an estimate of x which remains signiﬁcantly positive.

Overall, the results are slightly better for the Maximum Likelihood estimates obtained from the
GPD. Indeed, the bias observed for the Stretched-Exponential with c = 0.3 seems smaller for
large quantiles than the smallest biases reached by the GEV method. Thus, it appears that the
distribution of exceedance converges faster to its asymptotic distribution than the distribution of
maximum. However, while in line with the theoretical values, the standard deviations are found
almost always larger than in the previous case, which testiﬁes of the higher variability of this
estimator. Thus, for such sample sizes, the GEV and GPD Maximum Likelihood estimates should
be handled with care and there results interpreted with caution due to possibly important bias and
statistical ﬂuctuations. If a small value of x
seems to allow one to reliably conclude in favor of
a rapidly varying distribution, a positive estimate does not appear informative, and in particular
does not allow one to reject the rapidly varying behavior of a distribution.

Panel (b) and (c) of table 2 presents the same results for data with short and long memory, respec-
tively. We note the presence of a signiﬁcant downward bias (with respect to the iid case) in almost
every cases for the GPD estimates: the stronger the dependence, the more important is the bias.
At the same time, the empirical values of the standard deviations remain comparable with those
obtained in the previous case for iid data. The downward bias can be ascribed to the dependence
between data. Indeed, positive dependence yields important clustering of extremes and accumula-
tion of realizations around some values, which – for small samples – could (misleadingly) appear
as the consequence of the compactness of the support of the underlying distribution. This rational-
izes the negative x estimates obtained for the Stretched-Exponential distribution with c = 0.7. In
other words, for ﬁnite sample, the dependence prevents the full exploration of the tails and create
clusters that mimics a thinner tail (even if the clusters are occurring all at large values since what
is important is the range of exploration of the tail in order to control the value of x ).

The situation is different for the GEV estimates which show either an upward or downward bias
(with respect to the iid case). Here two effects are competing. On the one hand, the dependence
creates a downward bias, as explained above, while, on the other hand, the lack of convergence of
the distribution of maxima toward its GEV asymptotic distribution results in an upward bias, as
observed on iid data. This last phenomemon is strengthened by the existence of time dependence
which leads to decrease the “effective” sample size ( the actual size divided by the correlation
length l = (cid:229) C(t) = (1
1) and thus slows down the convergence rate toward the asymptotic
distribution even more. Interestingly, both the GEV and GPD estimators for the Pareto distribution
may be utterly wrong in presence of long range dependence for any cluster sizes.

a)−

−

To summarize, two opposite effects are competing. On the one hand, non-asymptotic effects due
to the slow convergence toward the asymptotic GEV or GPD distributions yield an upward or
downward bias. This effect seems more pronounced for GEV distributions and becomes more
important when the correlation length increases since the “effective” sample size decreases. On
the other hand, the presence of dependence in the data induces a downward bias and sometimes an
increase of the standard deviation of the estimated values. The qualitative effect can be described
as follows: the larger a is, the smaller is the x -estimate, provided - of course - that the “effective”
sample size is kept constant, everything being otherwise taken equal.

15

These two entangled effects, which sometimes compete and sometimes oppose each other, have
also been observed for non-Markovian processes drawn from Gaussian processes with long range
correlation. Thus, the existence of an important bias and the increase in the scattering of esti-
mates is a general and genuine progeny of the time dependence.
It leads us to the conclusion
that the Maximum Likelihood estimators derived from the GEV or GPD distributions are not very
efﬁcient for the investigation of the ﬁnancial data whose sample sizes are moderate and which
exhibit complicated serial dependence. The only positive note is that the GPD estimator correctly
recovers the range of the index x with an uncertainty smaller than 20% for data with a pure Pareto
distribution while it is cannot reject the hypothesis that x = 0 when the data is generated with a
Stretched-Exponential distribution, albeit with a very large uncertainty, in other words with little
power.

Table 3 focuses on the results given by Pickands’ estimator for the tail index of the GPD. For
each thresholds u, corresponding to the quantiles 90%, 95%, 99% and 99.5% respectively, the
results of our simulations are given for two particular values of k (deﬁned in (9)) corresponding
to N/k = 4, which is the largest admissible value, and N/k = 10 corresponding to be sufﬁciently
far in the tail of the GPD. Table 3 provides the mean value and the numerically estimated as
well as the theoretical (given by (10)) standard deviation of ˆx k,N. Panel (a) gives the result for
iid data. The mean values do not exhibit a signiﬁcant bias for the Pareto distribution and the
Stretched-Exponential with c = 0.7, but are utterly wrong in the case c = 0.3 since the estimates
are comparable with those given for the Pareto distribution. In each case, we note a very good
agreement between the empirical and theoretical standard deviations, even for the larger quantiles
(and thus the smaller samples). Panels (b-c) present the results for dependent data. The estimated
standard deviations remains of the same order as the theoretical ones, contrarily to results reported
by Kearns and Pagan (1997) for IGARCH processes. However, like these authors, we ﬁnd that the
bias, either positive or negative, becomes very signiﬁcant and leads one to misclassify a Stretched-
Exponential distribution with c = 0.3 for a Pareto distribution with b = 3. Thus, in presence of
dependence, Pickands’ estimator is unreliable.

To summarize, the determination of the maximum domain of attraction with usual estimators does
not appear to be a very efﬁcient way to study the extreme properties of dependent times series.
Almost all the previous studies which have investigated the tail behavior of asset returns distri-
butions have focused on these methods (see the inﬂuential works of Longin (1996) for instance)
and may thus have led to spurious results on the determination of the tail behavior. In particular,
our simulations show that rapidly varying function may be mistaken for regularly varying func-
tions. Thus, according to our simulations, this casts doubts on the strength of the conclusion of
previous works that the distributions of returns are regularly varying as seems to have been the
consensus until now and suggests to re-examine the possibility that the distribution of returns may
be rapidly varying as suggested by Gouri´eroux and Jasiak (1998) or Laherr`ere and Sornette (1999)
for instance. We now turn to this question using the framework of GEV and GDP estimators just
described.

3.5 GEV and GPD estimators of the Dow Jones and Nasdaq data sets

We have applied the same analysis as in the previous section on the real samples of the Dow
Jones and Nasdaq (raw and corrected) returns.
In order to estimate the standard deviations of
Pickands’ estimator for the GPD derived from the upper quantiles of these distributions, and of
ML-estimators for the distribution of maximum and for the GPD, we have randomly generated
one thousand sub-samples, each sub-sample being constituted of ten thousand data points in the

16

positive or negative parts of the samples respectively (with replacement). It should be noted that
the ML-estimates themselves were derived from the full samples. The results are given in tables 4
and 5.

These results conﬁrm the confusion about the tail behavior of the returns distributions and it seems
impossible to exclude a rapidly varying behavior of their tails. Indeed, even the estimations per-
formed by Maximum Likelihood with the GPD tail index, which have appeared as the least unreli-
able estimator in our previous tests, does not allow us to clearly reject the hypothesis that the tails
of the empirical distributions of returns are rapidly varying, in particular for large quantile values.
For the Nasdaq dataset, accounting for the lunch effect does not yield any signiﬁcant change in the
estimations. This observation will be conﬁrmed by the other tests presented in the next sections.

As a last non-parametric attempt to distinguish between a regularly varying tail and a rapidly vary-
ing tail of the exponential or Stretched-Exponential families, we study the Mean Excess Function
which is one of the known methods that often can help in deciding what parametric family is
appropriate for approximation (see for details Embrechts et al. (1997)). The Mean Excess Func-
tion MEF(u) of a random value X (also called “shortfall” when applied to negative returns in the
context of ﬁnancial risk management) is deﬁned as

MEF(u) = E(X

X > u) .
u
|

−

(22)

The Mean Excess Function MEF(u) is obviously related to the GPD for sufﬁciently large thresh-
old u and its behavior can be derived in this limit for the three maximum domains of attraction.
In addition, more precise results can be given for particular random variables, even in a non-
asymptotic regime. Indeed, for an exponential random variable X , the MEF(u) is just a constant.
For a Pareto random variable, the MEF(u) is a straight increasing line, whereas for the Stretched-
Exponential and the Gauss distributions, the MEF(u) is a decreasing function. We evaluated the
sample analogues of the MEF(u) (Embrechts et al. 1997, p.296) which are shown in ﬁgure 4. All
attempts to ﬁnd a constant or a linearly increasing behavior of the MEF(u) on the main central
part of the range of returns were ineffective. In the central part of the range of negative returns
X
> 0.025 ; q ∼= 96% for DJ data), the MEF(u) behaves

tail index of the distribution of X . For a Stretched-Exponential variable X with fractional exponent
c, it turns out that MLEF(u) behaves like a regularly varying function whose tail index equals
c.
Thus, in a double logarithmic plot, such a behavior is characterized by a decreasing straigth line
with slope
c. Sample estimates of MLEF(u) are shown in ﬁgure 5. On about 90% of the range
of the sample, the Mean Log-Excess functions behaves as expected for Stretched-Exponentially
distributed variables, while in the tail range (about 10% of the largest values), the results are
very confusing, due to the importance of the statistical ﬂuctuations. Such behavior of MLEF(u)
in the tails cannot be attributed deﬁnitely to a regularly varying or to a Stretched-Exponentially
distributed random variable. Therefore, a change of regime cannot be excluded in the extreme tail
of the distributions.

In view of the stalemate reached with the above non-parametric approaches and in particular with
the standard extreme value estimators, the sequel of this paper is devoted to the investigation of a
parametric approach in order to decide which class of extreme value distributions, rapidly versus
regularly varying, accounts best for the empirical distributions of returns.

4 Fitting distributions of returns with parametric densities

Since our previous results lead to doubt the validity of the rejection of the hypothesis that the dis-
tribution of returns are rapidly varying, we now propose to pit a parametric champion for this class
of functions against the Pareto champion of regularly varying functions. To represent the class of
rapidly varying functions, we propose the family of Stretched-Exponentials. As discussed in the
introduction, the class of stretched exponentials is motivated in part from a theoretical view point
by the fact that the large deviations of multiplicative processes are generically distributed with
stretched exponential distributions (Frisch and Sornette 1997). Stretched exponential distributions
are also parsimonious examples of sub-exponential distributions with fat tails for instance in the
sense of the asymptotic probability weight of the maximum compared with the sum of large sam-
ples (Feller 1971). Notwithstanding their fat-tailness, Stretched Exponential distributions have all
their moments ﬁnite6, in contrast with regularly varying distributions for which moments of order
equal to or larger than the index b are not deﬁned. This property may provide a substantial ad-
vantage to exploit in generalizations of the mean-variance portfolio theory using higher-order mo-
ments (Rubinstein 1973, Fang and Lai 1997, Hwang and Satchell 1999, Sornette et al. 2000, An-
dersen and Sornette 2001, Jurczenko and Maillet 2002, Malevergne and Sornette 2002, for instance
). Moreover, the existence of all moments is an important property allowing for an efﬁcient estima-
tion of any high-order moment, since it ensures that the estimators are asymptotically Gaussian. In
particular, for Stretched-Exponentially distributed random variables, the variance, skewness and
kurtosis can be well estimated, contrarily to random variables with regularly varying distribution
with tail index in the range 3

4.1 Deﬁnition of two parametric families

4.1.1 A general 3-parameters family of distributions

We thus consider a general 3-parameters family of distributions and its particular restrictions cor-
responding to some ﬁxed value(s) of two (one) parameters. This family is deﬁned by its density
function given by:

if x < u.

Here, b, c, d are unknown parameters, u is a known lower threshold that will be varied for the
purposes of our analysis and A(b, c, d, u) is a normalizing constant given by the expression:

A(b, c, d, u) =

6However, they do not admit an exponential moment, which leads to problems in the reconstruction of the distribu-

tion from the knowledge of their moments (Stuart and Ord 1994).

where G (a, x) denotes the (non-normalized) incomplete Gamma function. The parameter b ranges
from minus inﬁnity to inﬁnity while c and d range from zero to inﬁnity. In the particular case
where c = 0, the parameter b also needs to be positive to ensure the normalization of the probability
density function (pdf). The interval of deﬁnition of this family is the positive semi-axis. Negative
log-returns will be studied by taking their absolute values. The family (24) includes several well-
known pdf’s often used in different applications. We enumerate them.

processes (Sobehart and Farengo 2002, Biham et al. 1998, 2002).

Thus, the Pareto distribution (PD) and exponential distribution (ED) are one-parameter families,
whereas the stretched exponential (SE) and the incomplete Gamma distribution (IG) are two-
parameter families. The comprehensive distribution (CD) given by equation (24) contains three
unknown parameters.

This shows that the Pareto model can be approximated with any desired accuracy on an arbitrary

Another interesting behavior is obtained in the limit b

the Exponential model (Bouchaud and Potters 2000). Indeed, provided that the scale parameter u
of the power law is simultaneously scaled as ub = (b/a )b, we can write the tail of the cumulative
distribution function of the PD as ub/(u + x)b which is indeed of the form ub/xb for large x. Then,
ub/(u + x)b = (1 + a x/b)−

This family of pdf interpolates smoothly between the Stretched-Exponential and Pareto classes.
It recovers the Pareto family for c = 1, in which case the parameter b is the tail exponent. For c
larger than 1, the tail of the log-Weibull is thinner than any Pareto distribution but heavier than any
Stretched-Exponential7 . In particular, when c equals two, the log-normal distribution is retrieved
(above threshold u). For c smaller than 1, the tails of the SLE are even heavier than any Pareto
distributions. This range of parameter is probably not useful except maybe to account of “outliers”
in the spirit of Johansen and Sornette (2002); this will require a speciﬁc investigation.

4.2 Methodology

We start with ﬁtting our two data sets (DJ and ND) by the ﬁve distributions enumerated above (24)
and (26-29). Our ﬁrst goal is to show that no single parametric representation among any of the
cited pdf’s ﬁts the whole range of the data sets. Recall that we analyze separately positive and
negative returns (the later being converted to the positive semi-axis). We shall use in our analysis
a movable lower threshold u, restricting by this threshold our sample to observations satisfying to
x > u.

In addition to estimating the parameters involved in each representation (24,26-29) by maximum
likelihood for each particular threshold u8, we need a characterization of the goodness-of-ﬁt. For
this, we propose to use a distance between the estimated distribution and the sample distribution.
Many distances can be used: mean-squared error, Kullback-Liebler distance9, Kolmogorov dis-
tance, Sherman distance (as in Longin (1996)) or Anderson-Darling distance, to cite a few. We can
also use one of these distances to determine the parameters of each pdf according to the criterion
of minimizing the distance between the estimated distribution and the sample distribution. The
chosen distance is thus useful both for characterizing and for estimating the parametric pdf. In the
later case, once an estimation of the parameters of particular distribution family has been obtained
according to the selected distance, we need to quantify the statistical signiﬁcance of the ﬁt. This
requires to derive the statistics associated with the chosen distance. These statistics are known for
most of the distances cited above, in the limit of large sample.

We have chosen the Anderson-Darling distance to derive our estimated parameters and perform our
tests of goodness of ﬁt. The Anderson-Darling distance between a theoretical distribution function
F(x) and its empirical analog FN(x), estimated from a sample of N realizations, is evaluated as
follows:

where wk = 2k/(2N + 1), k = 1 . . . N and y1 6 . . . 6 yN is its ordered sample. If the sample is drawn
from a population with distribution function F(x), the Anderson-Darling statistics (ADS) has a

the c 2 for the c 2-statistic, or the Kolmogorov distribution for the Kolmogorov statistic. It should
be noted that the ADS weights the squared difference in eq.(34) by 1/F(x)(1
F(x)) which is
nothing but the inverse of the variance of the difference in square brackets. The AD distance
thus emphasizes more the tails of the distribution than, say, the Kolmogorov distance which is
determined by the maximum absolute deviation of Fn(x) from F(x) or the mean-squared error,
which is mostly controlled by the middle of range of the distribution. Since we have to insert
the estimated parameters into the ADS, this statistic does not obey any more the standard AD-
distribution: the ADS decreases because the use of the ﬁtting parameters ensures a better ﬁt to
the sample distribution. However, we can still use the standard quantiles of the AD-distribution
as upper boundaries of the ADS. If the observed ADS is larger than the standard quantile with
e ), we can then conclude that the null hypothesis F(x) is rejected
a high signiﬁcance level (1
e ). If we wish to estimate the real signiﬁcance level of the
with signiﬁcance level larger than (1
ADS in the case where it does not exceed the standard quantile of a high signiﬁcance level, we are
forced to use some other method of estimation of the signiﬁcance level of the ADS, such as the
bootstrap method.

In the following, the estimates minimizing the Anderson-Darling distance will be refered to as AD-
estimates. The maximum likelihood estimates (ML-estimates) are asymptotically more efﬁcient
than AD-estimates for independent data and under the condition that the null hypothesis (given by
one of the four distributions (26-29), for instance) corresponds to the true data generating model.
When this is not the case, the AD-estimates provide a better practical tool for approximating
sample distributions compared with the ML-estimates.

We have determined the AD-estimates for 18 standard signiﬁcance levels q1 . . . q18 given in ta-
ble 6. The corresponding sample quantiles corresponding to these signiﬁcance levels or thresh-
olds u1 . . . u18 for our samples are also shown in table 6. Despite the fact that thresholds uk vary
from sample to sample, they always corresponded to the same ﬁxed set of signiﬁcance levels qk
throughout the paper and allows us to compare the goodness-of-ﬁt for samples of different sizes.

4.3 Empirical results

The Anderson-Darling statistics (ADS) for six parametric distributions (Weibull or Stretched-
Exponential, Generalized Pareto, Gamma, Exponential, Pareto and Log-Weibull) are shown in
table 7 for two quantile ranges, the ﬁrst top half of the table corresponding to the 90% lowest
thresholds while the second bottom half corresponds to the 10% highest ones. For the lowest
thresholds, the ADS rejects all distributions, except the Stretched-Exponential for the Nasdaq.
Thus, none of the considered distributions is really adequate to model the data over such large
ranges. For the 10% highest quantiles, only the exponential model is rejected at the 95% conﬁ-
dence level. The Log-Weibull and the Stretched-Exponential distributions are the best, just above
the Pareto distribution and the Incomplete Gamma that cannot be rejected. We now present an
analysis of each case in more details.

be a straight line. Even in the tails, this is doubtful. To formalize this impression, we calculate the
Hill and AD estimators for each threshold u. Denoting y1 > . . . > ynu the ordered sub-sample of
values exceeding u where Nu is the size of this sub-sample, the Hill maximum likelihood estimate
of parameter b is (Hill 1975)

samples), the tail index estimator increases until u ∼= 0.04, beyond which it seems to slow its
growth and oscillates around a value
4 up to the threshold u ∼= .08. It should be noted that
the interval [0, 0.04] contains 99.12% of the sample whereas the interval [0.04, 0.08] contains only
0.64% of the sample. The behavior of ˆbu for the ND shown in ﬁgure 7b is similar: Hill’s estimate
ˆbu seems to slow its growth already at u ∼= 0.0013 corresponding to the 95% quantile. Are these
slowdowns of the growth of ˆbu genuine signatures of a possible constant well-deﬁned asymptotic
value that would qualify a regularly varying function?

≈

−

3

As a ﬁrst answer to this question, table 8 compares the AD-estimates of the tail exponent b with
the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates for the 18 intervals u1 . . . u18. Both maximum
likelihood and Anderson-Darling estimates of b steadily increase with the threshold u (except for
the highest quantiles of the positive tail of the Nasdaq). The corresponding ﬁgures for positive and
negative returns are very close to each other and almost never signiﬁcantly different at the usual
95% conﬁdence level. Some slight non-monotonicity of the increase for the highest thresholds can
be explained by small sample sizes. One can observe that both MLE and ADS estimates continue
increasing as the interval of estimation is contracting to the extreme values. It seems that their
growth potential has not been exhausted even for the largest quantile u18, except for the positive
tail of the Nasdaq sample. This statement might not be very strong as the standard deviations of the
tail index estimators also grow when exploring the largest quantiles. However, the non-exhausted
growth is observed for three samples out of the four tails. Moreover, this effect is seen for several
threshold values while random ﬂuctuations would distort the b-curve in a random manner rather
than according to the increasing trend observed in three out of four tails.

Assuming that the observation, that the sample distribution can be approximated by a Pareto distri-
bution with a growing index b, is correct, an important question arises: how far beyond the sample
this growth will continue? Judging from table 8, we can think this growth is still not exhausted.
Figure 8 suggests a speciﬁc form of this growth, by plotting the hill estimator ˆbu for all four data
sets (positive and negative branches of the distribution of returns for the DJ and for the ND) as a
function of the index n = 1, ..., 18 of the 18 quantiles or standard signiﬁcance levels q1 . . . q18 given
in table 6. Similar results are obtained with the AD estimates. Apart from the positive branch of
the ND data set, all other three branches suggest a continuous growth of the Hill estimator ˆbu
as a function of n = 1, ..., 18. Since the quantiles q1 . . . q18 given in table 6 have been chosen to
converge to 1 approximately exponentially as

instance, for a quantile 1

−
q is divided by a factor 10, the apparent exponent ˆbu(q) is increased by the additive
quantile 1
−
constant ∼= 1.45: ˆbu((1
q) + 1.45. This very slow growth uncovered here may
be an explanation for the belief and possibly mistaken conclusion that the Hill and other estimators
of the tail index tends to a constant for high quantiles. Indeed, it is now clear that the slowdowns
of the growth of ˆbu seen in ﬁgures 7 decorated by large ﬂuctuations due to small size effects is
mostly the result of a dilatation of the data expressed in terms of threshold u. When recast in the
more natural logarithm scale of the quantiles q1 . . . q18, this slowdown disappears. Of course, it is
impossible to know how long this growth given by (39) may go on as the quantile q tends to 1.
In other words, how can we escape from the sample range when estimating quantiles? How can
we estimate the so-called “high quantiles” at the level q > 1
1/T where T is the total number of
sampled points. Embrechts et al. (1997) have summarized the situation in this way: “there is no
free lunch when it comes to high quantiles estimation!” It is possible that ˆbu(q) will grow without
limit as would be the case if the true underlying distribution was rapidly varying. Alternatively,
ˆbu(q) may saturate to a large value, as predicted for instance by the traditional GARCH model
which yields tails indices which can reach 10
20 (Engle and Patton 2001, Starica and Pictet 1999)
or by the recent multifractal random walk (MRW) model which gives an asymptotic tail exponent
in the range 20

34)! If one believes
(respectively 50) would be attained for 1
10−
in the prediction of the MRW model, the tail of the distribution of returns is regularly varying
but this insight is completely useless for all practical purposes due to the astronomically high
statistics that would be needed to sample this regime.
In this context, we cannot hope to get
access to the true nature of the pdf of returns but only strive to deﬁne the best effective or apparent
most parsimonious and robust model. By comparing distributions of aggregated returns with their
corresponding reshufﬂed counterparts, Viswanathan et al. (2001) suggest that the fat tail nature
of the returns result mainly from the existence of long-range dependence, in agreement with the
construction of GARCH and MRW processes.

4.3.2 Weibull distributions

Let us now ﬁt our data with the Weibull (SE) distribution (27). The Anderson-Darling statistics
(ADS) for this case are shown in table 7. The ML-estimates and AD-estimates of the form pa-
rameter c are represented in table 9. Table 7 shows that, for the highest quantiles, the ADS for
the Stretched-Exponential is the smallest of all ADS, suggesting that the SE is the best model of
all. Moreover, for the lowest quantiles, it is the sole model not systematically rejected at the 95%
level.

The c-estimates are found to decrease when increasing the order q of the threshold uq beyond
which the estimations are performed. In addition, the c-estimate is identically zero for u18. How-
ever, this does not automatically imply that the SE model is not the correct model for the data
even for these highest quantiles. Indeed, numerical simulations show that, even for synthetic sam-
ples drawn from genuine Stretched-Exponential distributions with exponent c smaller than 0.5
and whose size is comparable with that of our data, in about one case out of three (depending on

24

the exact value of c) the estimated value of c is zero. This a priori surprising result comes from
condition (56) in appendix A which is not fulﬁlled with certainty even for samples drawn for SE
distributions.

Notwithstanding this cautionary remark, note that the c-estimate of the positive tail of the Nasdaq
data equal zero for all quantiles higher than q14 = 0.97%. In fact, in every cases, the estimated c
is not signiﬁcantly different from zero - at the 95% signiﬁcance level - for quantiles higher than
q12-q14. In addition, table 10 gives the values of the estimated scale parameter d, which are found
very small - particularly for the Nasdaq - beyond q12 = 95%. In contrast, the Dow Jones keeps
signiﬁcant scale factors until q16

q17.

−

These evidences taken all together provide a clear indication on the existence of a change of
behavior of the true pdf of these four distributions: while the bulks of the distributions seem
rather well approximated by a SE model, a fatter tailed distribution than that of the (SE) model is
required for the highest quantiles. Actually, the fact that both c and d are extremely small may be
interpreted according to the asymptotic correspondence given by (30) and (31) as the existence of
a possible power law tail.

4.3.3 Exponential and incomplete Gamma distributions

Let us now ﬁt our data with the exponential distribution (28). The average ADS for this case
are shown in table 7. The maximum likelihood- and Anderson-Darling estimates of the scale
parameter d are given in table 11. Note that they always decrease as the threshold uq increases.
Comparing the mean ADS-values of table 7 with the standard AD quantiles, we can conclude that,
on the whole, the exponential distribution (even with moving scale parameter d) does not ﬁt our
data: this model is systematically rejected at the 95% conﬁdence level for the lowest and highest
quantiles - excepted for the negative tail of the Nasdaq.

Finally, we ﬁt our data by the IG-distribution (29). The mean ADS for this class of functions are
shown in table 7. The Maximum likelihood and Anderson Darling estimates of the power index
b are represented in table 12. Comparing the mean ADS-values of table 7 with the standard AD
quantiles, we can again conclude that, on the whole, the IG-distribution does not ﬁt our data. The
model is rejected at the 95% conﬁdence level excepted for the negative tail of the Nasdaq for which
it is not rejected marginally (signiﬁcance level: 94.13%). However, for the largest quantiles, this
model becomes again relevant since it cannot be rejected at the 95% level.

4.3.4 Log-Weibull distributions

The parameters b and c of the log-Weibull deﬁned by (32) are estimated with both the Maximum
Likelihood and Anderson-Darling methods for the 18 standard signiﬁcance levels q1 . . . q18 given
in table 6. The results of these estimations are given in table 13. For both positive and negative
tails of the Dow Jones, we ﬁnd very stable results for all quantiles lower than q10: c = 1.09
0.02
and b = 2.71
0.07. These results reject the Pareto distribution degeneracy c = 1 at the 95%
conﬁdence level. Only for the quantiles higher than or equal to q16, we ﬁnd an estimated value c
compatible with the Pareto distribution. Moreover both for the positive and negative Dow Jones
tails, we ﬁnd that c
3.8, suggesting a possible change of regime or a sensitivity
to “outliers” or a lack of robustness due to the small sample size. For the positive Nasdaq tail, the
exponent c is found compatible with c = 1 (the Pareto value), at the 95% signiﬁcance level, above
3.2. For the negative Nasdaq tail, we ﬁnd that c decreases

almost systematically from 1.1 for q10 to 1 for q18 for both estimators while b regularly increases
from about 3.1 to about 4.2. The Anderson-Darling distances are not worse but not signiﬁcantly
better than for the SE and this statistics cannot be used to conclude neither in favor of nor against
the log-Weibull class.

4.4 Summary

At this stage, two conclusions can be drawn. First, it appears that none of the considered distri-
butions ﬁt the data over the entire range, which is not a surprise. Second, for the highest quan-
tiles, four models seem to be able to represent to data, the Gamma model, the Pareto model,
the Stretched-Exponential model and the log-Weibull model. The two last ones have the low-
est Anderson-Darling statistics and thus seems to be the most reasonable models among the four
models compatible with the data. For all the samples, their Anderson-Darling statistic remain so
close to each other for the quantiles higher than q10 that the descriptive power of these two models
cannot be distinguished.

5 Comparison of the descriptive power of the different families

As we have seen by comparing the Anderson-Darling statistics corresponding to the ﬁve paramet-
ric families (26-29) and (33), the best models in the sense of minimizing the Anderson-Darling
distance are the Stretched-Exponential and the Log-Weibull distributions.

We now compare the four distributions (26-29) with the comprehensive distribution (24) using
Wilks’ theorem (Wilks 1938) of nested hypotheses to check whether or not some of the four
distributions are sufﬁcient compared with the comprehensive distribution to describe the data. It
will appear that the Pareto and the Stretched-Exponential models are the most parsimonious. We
then turn to a direct comparison of the best two parameter models (the SE and log-Weibull models)
with the best one parameter model (the Pareto model), which will require an extension of Wilks’
theorem derived in Appendix D that will allow us to directly test the SE model against the Pareto
model.

5.1 Comparison between the four parametric families (26-29) and the comprehen-

sive distribution (24)

According to Wilks’ theorem, the doubled generalized log-likelihood ratio L

:

L = 2 log

max L (CD, X , Q )
max L (z, X , q )

,

(40)

has asymptotically (as the size N of the sample X tends to inﬁnity) the c 2-distribution. Here L
denotes the likelihood function, q and Q
are parametric spaces corresponding to hypotheses z and
CD correspondingly (hypothesis z is one of the four hypotheses (26-29) that are particular cases of
the CD under some parameter relations). The statement of the theorem is valid under the condition
that the sample X obeys hypothesis z for some particular value of its parameter belonging to the
. The number of degrees of freedom of the c 2-distribution equals to the difference of
space q
the dimensions of the two spaces Q
. We have dim(Q ) = 3, dim(q ) = 2 for the Stretched-
Exponential and for the Incomplete Gamma distributions while dim(q ) = 1 for the Pareto and the

and q

Exponential distributions. This corresponds to one degree of freedom for the two former cases and
two degrees of freedom for the later pdf’s. The maximum of the likelihood in the numerator of
(40) is taken over the space Q
, whereas the maximum of the likelihood in the denominator of (40)
is taken over the space q
, the likelihood ratio is always larger than
1, and the log-likelihood ratio is non-negative. If the observed value of L does not exceed some
high-conﬁdence level (say, 99% conﬁdence level) of the c 2, we then reject the hypothesis CD in
favor of the hypothesis z, considering the space Q
redundant. Otherwise, we accept the hypothesis
CD, considering the space q

. Since we have always q

insufﬁcient.

⊂

The doubled log-likelihood ratios (40) are shown in ﬁgures 9 for the positive and negative branches
of the distribution of returns of the Nasdaq and in ﬁgures 10 for the Dow Jones. The 95% c 2
conﬁdence levels for 1 and 2 degrees of freedom are given by the horizontal lines.

−

For the Nasdaq data, ﬁgure 9 clearly shows that Exponential distribution is completely insufﬁcient:
for all lower thresholds, the Wilks log-likelihood ratio exceeds the 95% c 2
1 level 3.84. The Pareto
distribution is insufﬁcient for thresholds u1
u11 (92.5% of the ordered sample) and becomes
u18 (7.5% of the tail probabil-
comparable with the Comprehensive distribution in the tail u12
ity). It is natural that two-parametric families Incomplete Gamma and Stretched-Exponential have
higher goodness-of-ﬁt than the one-parametric Exponential and Pareto distributions. The Incom-
plete Gamma distribution is comparable with the Comprehensive distribution starting with u10
(90%), whereas the Stretched-Exponential is somewhat better (u9 or u8 , i.e., 70%). For the tails
representing 7.5% of the data, all parametric families except for the Exponential distribution ﬁt the
sample distribution with almost the same efﬁciency. The results obtained for the Dow Jones data
shown in ﬁgure 10 are similar. The Stretched-Exponential is comparable with the Comprehensive
distribution starting with u8 (70%). On the whole, one can say that the Stretched-Exponential
distribution performs better than the three other parametric families.

−

We should stress that each log-likelihood ratio represented in ﬁgures 9 and 10, so-to say “acts
on its own ground,” that is, the corresponding c 2-distribution is valid under the assumption of
the validity of each particular hypothesis whose likelihood stands in the numerator of the double
log-likelihood (40). It would be desirable to compare all combinations of pairs of hypotheses di-
rectly, in addition to comparing each of them with the comprehensive distribution. Unfortunately,
the Wilks theorem can not be used in the case of pair-wise comparison because the problem is
not more that of comparing nested hypothesis (that is, one hypothesis is a particular case of the
comprehensive model). As a consequence, our results on the comparison of the relative merits
of each of the four distributions using the generalized log-likelihood ratio should be interpreted
with a care, in particular, in a case of contradictory conclusions. Fortunately, the main conclusion
of the comparison (an advantage of the Stretched-Exponential distribution over the three other
distribution) does not contradict our earlier results discussed above.

5.2 Pair-wise comparison of the Pareto model with the Stretched-Exponential and

Log-Weibull models

We now want to compare formally the descriptive power of the Stretched-Exponential distribution
and the Log-Weibull distribution (the two best two-parameter models) with that of the Pareto dis-
tribution (the best one-parameter model). For the comparison of the Log-Weibull model versus
the Pareto model, Wilks’ theorem can still be applied since the Log-Weibull distribution encom-
passes the Pareto distribution. A contrario, the comparison of the Stretched-Exponential versus
the Pareto distribution should in principle require that we use the methods for testing non-nested

27

Q
hypotheses (Gouri´eroux and Monfort 1994), such as the Wald encompassing test or the Bayes
factors (Kass and Raftery 1995). Indeed, the Pareto model and the (SE) model are not, strictly
speaking, nested. However, as exposed in section 4.1.1, the Pareto distribution is a limit case of
the Stretched-Exponential distribution, as the fractional exponent c goes to zero. Changing the
parametric representation of the (SE) model into

still follows Wilks’ statistic, namely is asymptotically distributed according to a c 2-distribution,
with one degree of freedom in the present case. Thus, even in this case of non-nested hypotheses,
Wilks’ statistic still allows us to test the null hypothesis H0 according to which the Pareto model
is sufﬁcient to describe the data.

The results of these tests are given in tables 14 and 15. The p-value (ﬁgures within parentheses)
gives the signiﬁcance with which one can reject the null hypothesis H0 that the Pareto distribution
is sufﬁcient to accurately describe the data. Table 14 compares the Stretched-Exponential with
Pareto distribution. H0 is found to be more often rejected for the Dow Jones than for the Nasdaq.
Indeed, beyond quantile q12 = 95%, H0 cannot be rejected at the 95% conﬁdence level for the
Nasdaq data. For the Dow Jones, we must consider quantiles higher than q16 = 99% -at least
for the negative tail- in order not to reject H0 at the 95% signiﬁcance level. These results are in
qualitative agreement with what we could expect from the action of the central limit theorem: the
power-law regime (if it really exists) is pushed back to higher quantiles due to time aggregation
(recall that the Dow Jones data is at the daily scale while the Nasdaq data is at the 5 minutes time
scale).

Table 15 shows Wilks’ test for the Pareto distribution versus the log-Weibull distribution. For
quantiles above q12, the Wilks’ statistic is mostly insigniﬁcant, that is, the Pareto distribution
cannot be rejected in favor of of the Log-Weibull. This parallels the lack of rejection of the Pareto
distribution against the Stretched-Exponential beyond the signiﬁcance level q12.

In summary, Stretched-Exponential and Log-Weibull models encompass the Pareto model as soon
as one considers quantiles higher than q6 = 50%. The null hypothesis that the true distribution
is the Pareto distribution is strongly rejected until quantiles 90%
95% or so. Thus, within this
range, the (SE) and (SLE) models seem the best and the Pareto model is insufﬁcient to describe
98%), we cannot reject any more
the data. But, for the very highest quantiles (above 95%
the hypothesis that the Pareto model is sufﬁcient compared with the (SE) and (SLE) model. These
two parameter models can then be seen as a redundant parameterization for the extremes compared
with the Pareto distribution.

6 Discussion and Conclusions

6.1 Is there a best model of tails?

We have presented a statistical analysis of the tail behavior of the distributions of the daily log-
returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and of the 5-minutes log-returns of the Nasdaq Com-

28

posite index. We have emphasized practical aspects of the application of statistical methods to this
problem. Although the application of statistical methods to the study of empirical distributions of
returns seems to be an obvious approach, it is necessary to keep in mind the existence of necessary
conditions that the empirical data must obey for the conclusions of the statistical study to be valid.
Maybe the most important condition in order to speak meaningfully about distribution functions
is the stationarity of the data, a difﬁcult issue that we have barely touched upon here. In particular,
the importance of regime switching is now well established (Ramcham and Susmel 1998, Ang and
Bekeart 2001) and its possible role should be accounted for.

Our purpose here has been to revisit a generally accepted fact that the tails of the distributions
of returns present a power-like behavior. Although there are some disagreements concerning the
exact value of the power indices (the majority of previous workers accepts index values between
3 and 3.5, depending on the particular asset and the investigated time interval), the power-like
character of the tails of distributions of returns is not subjected to doubts. Often, the conviction
of the existence of a power-like tail is based on the Gnedenko theorem stating the existence of
only three possible types of limit distributions of normalized maxima (a ﬁnite maximum value,
an exponential tail, and a power-like tail) together with the exclusion of the ﬁrst two types by
experimental evidence. The power-like character of the log-return tail ¯F(x) follows then simply
from the power-like distribution of maxima. However, in this chain of arguments, the conditions
needed for the fulﬁllment of the corresponding mathematical theorems are often omitted and not
discussed properly. In addition, widely used arguments in favor of power law tails invoke the self-
similarity of the data but are often assumptions rather than experimental evidence or consequences
of economic and ﬁnancial laws.

Here, we have shown that standard statistical estimators of heavy tails are much less efﬁcient that
often assumed and cannot in general clearly distinguish between a power law tail and a Stretched
Exponential tail even in the absence of long-range dependence in the volatility. In fact, this can be
rationalized by our discovery that, in a certain limit where the exponent c of the stretched expo-
nential pdf goes to zero (together with condition (30) as seen in the derivation (31)), the stretched
exponential pdf tends to the Pareto distribution. Thus, the Pareto (or power law) distribution can
be approximated with any desired accuracy on an arbitrary interval by a suitable adjustment of the
pair (c, d) of the parameters of the stretched exponential pdf. We have then turned to parametric
tests which indicate that the class of Stretched Exponential and log-Weibull distributions provide
a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt to empirical returns than the Pareto, the exponential or the incomplete
Gamma distributions. All our tests are consistent with the conclusion that these two model pro-
vide the best effective apparent and parsimonious models to account for the empirical data on the
largest possible range of returns.

However, this does not mean that the stretched exponential (SE) or the log-Weibull model is the
correct description of the tails of empirical distributions of returns. Again, as already mentioned,
the strength of these models come from the fact that they encompass the Pareto model in the tail
and offers a better description in the bulk of the distribution. To see where the problem arises, we
report in table 16 our best ML-estimates for the SE parameters c (form parameter) and d (scale
parameter) restricted to the quantile level q12 = 95%, which offers a good compromise between
a sufﬁciently large sample size and a restricted tail range leading to an accurate approximation in
this range.

One can see that c is very small (and all the more so for the scale parameter d) for the tail of
positive returns of the Nasdaq data suggesting a convergence to a power law tail. The exponents
c for the three other tails are an order of magnitude larger but our tests show that they are not
incompatible with an asymptotic power tail either. Indeed, we have shown in section 5.2 that,

29

−

98%), we cannot reject the hypothesis that the Pareto

Note also that the exponents c seem larger for the daily DJ data than for the 5-minutes ND data, in
agreement with an expected (slow) convergence to the Gaussian law according to the central limit
theory 10. However, a t-test does not allow us to reject the hypotheses that the exponents c remains
the same for a given tail (positive or negative) of the Dow Jones data. Thus, we conﬁrm previous
results (Lux 1996, Jondeau and Rockinger 2001, for instance) according to which the extreme tails
can be considered as symmetric, at least for the Dow Jones data. In contrast, we ﬁnd a very strong
asymmetry for the 5-minute sampled Nasdaq data.

These are the evidence in favor of the existence of an asymptotic power law tail. Balancing this,
many of our tests have shown that the power law model is not as powerful compared with the SE
and SLE models, even arbitrarily far in the tail (as far as the available data allows us to probe).
In addition, our attempts for a direct estimation of the exponent b of a possible power law tail
has failed to conﬁrm the existence of a well-converged asymptotic value (except maybe for the
positive tail of the Nasdaq). In contrast, we have found that the exponent b of the power law
model systematically increases when going deeper and deeper in the tails, with no visible sign of
exhausting this growth. We have proposed a parameterization of this growth of the apparent power
law exponent. We note again that this behavior is expected from models such as the GARCH or the
Multifractal Random Walk models which predict asymptotic power law tails but with exponents
of the order of 20 or larger, that would be sampled at unattainable quantiles.

Attempting to wrap up the different results obtained by the battery of tests presented here, we can
offer the following conservative conclusion: it seems that the four tails examined here are decaying
faster than any (reasonable) power law but slower than any stretched exponentials. Maybe log-
normal or log-Weibull distributions could offer a better effective description of the distribution of
returns11. Such a model has already been suggested by (Serva et al. 2002).

In sum, the PD is sufﬁcient above quantiles q12 = 95% but is not stable enough to ascertain with
strong conﬁdence a power law asymptotic nature of the pdf. Other studies using much larger
database of up to tens of millions of data points (Gopikrishnan et al. 1998, Gopikrishnan et al.
1999, Plerou et al. 1999, Matia et al. 2002, Mizuno et al. 2002) seem to conﬁrm an asymptotic
power law with exponent close to 3 but the effect of aggregation of returns from different assets
may distort the information and the very structure of the tails of pdf if they exhibit some intrinsic
variability (Matia et al. 2002).

6.2 Implications for risk assessment

The correct description of the distribution of returns has important implications for the assessment
of large risks not yet sampled by historical time series. Indeed, the whole purpose of a charac-
terization of the functional form of the distribution of returns is to extrapolate currently available
historical time series beyond the range provided by the empirical reconstruction of the distribu-
tions. For risk management, the determination of the tail of the distribution is crucial. Indeed,

10see Sornette et al. (2000) and ﬁgures 3.6-3.8 pp. 68 of Sornette (2000) where it is shown that SE distributions are
approximately stable in family and the effect of aggregation can be seen to slowly increase the exponent c. See also
Drozdz et al. (2002) which studies speciﬁcally this convergence to a Gaussian law as a function of the time scale level.
11Let us stress that we are speaking of a log-normal distribution of returns, not of price! Indeed, the standard Black
and Scholes model of a log-normal distribution of prices is equivalent to a Gaussian distribution of returns. Thus, a log-
normal distribution of returns is much more fat tailed, and in fact bracketed by power law tails and stretched exponential
tails.

30

many risk measures, such as the Value-at-Risk or the Expected-Shortfall, are based on the proper-
ties of the tail of the distributions of returns. In order to assess risk at probability levels of 95% or
more, non-parametric methods have merits. However, in order to estimate risks at high probability
level such as 99% or larger, non-parametric estimations fail by lack of data and parametric mod-
els become unavoidable. This shift in strategy has a cost and replaces sampling errors by model
errors. The considered distribution can be too thin-tailed as when using normal laws, and risk
will be underestimated, or it is too fat-tailed and risk will be over estimated as with L´evy law and
possibly with Pareto tails according to the present study. In each case, large amounts of money are
at stake and can be lost due to a too conservative or too optimistic risk measurement.

In order to bypass these problems, some authors (Bali 2003, Longin 2000, McNiel and Frey 2000,
among many others) have proposed to estimate the extreme quantiles of the distributions in a semi-
parametric way, which allows one (i) to avoid the model errors and (ii) to limit the sampling errors
with respect to non-parametric methods and thus to keep a reasonable accuracy in the estimation
procedure. To this aim, it has been suggested to use the extreme value theory12 . However, as
emphasized in section 3.4, estimates of the parameters of such (GEV or GPD) distributions can
be very unreliable in presence of dependence, so that such methods ﬁnally appears to be not very
accurate and one cannot avoid a parametric approach for the estimations of the highest quantiles.

Our present study suggests that the Paretian paradigm leads to an overestimation of the probability
of large events and therefore leads to the adoption of too conservative positions. Generalizing to
larger time scales, the overly pessimistic view of large risks deriving from the Paretian paradigm
should be all the more revised, due to the action of the central limit theorem. Our comparison
between several models which turn out to be almost undistinguishable such as the stretched expo-
nential, the Pareto and the log-Weibull distributions, offers the important possibility of developing
scenarios that can test the sensitivity of risk assessment to errors in the determination of param-
eters and even more interesting with respect to the choice of models, often refered to as model
errors.

Finally, an additional note of caution is in order. This study has focused on the marginal dis-
tributions of returns calculated at ﬁxed time scales and thus neglects the possible occurrence of
runs of dependencies, such as in cumulative drawdowns. In the presence of dependencies between
returns, and especially if the dependence is non stationary and increases in time of stress, the
characterization of the marginal distributions of returns is not sufﬁcient. As an example, Johansen
and Sornette (2002) have recently shown that the recurrence time of very large drawdowns cannot
be predicted from the sole knowledge of the distribution of returns and that transient dependence
effects occurring in time of stress make very large drawdowns more frequent, qualifying them as
abnormal “outliers.”

Table 3: Pickands estimates (9) of the parameter x
for the Generalized Pareto Distribution (7) for thresholds u corresponding to quantiles 90%, 95%, 99% ans 99.5%
and two different values of the ratio N/k respectively equal to 4 and 10. In panel (a), we have used iid samples of size 10000 drawn from a Stretched-Exponential
distribution with c = 0.7 and c = 0.3 and a Pareto distribution with tail index b = 3, while in panel (b) the samples are drawn from a long memory process with
Stretched-Exponential marginals and regularly-varying marginal.

Table 7: Mean Anderson-Darling distances in the range of thresholds u1-u9 and in the range u10-
u18. The ﬁgures within parenthesis characterize the goodness of ﬁt: they represent the signiﬁcance
levels with which the considered model can be rejected. Note that these signiﬁcance levels are
only lower bounds since one or two parameters are ﬁtted.

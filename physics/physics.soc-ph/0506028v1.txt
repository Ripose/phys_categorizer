Some general features of kinetic multi-agent models are reviewed, with particular attention to
the relation between the agent saving propensities and the form of the equilibrium wealth distribu-
tion. The eﬀect of a ﬁnite cutoﬀ of the saving propensity distribution on the corresponding wealth
distribution is studied. Various results about kinetic multi-agent models are collected and used to
construct a realistic wealth distribution with zero limit for small values of wealth, an exponential
form at intermediate and a power law tail at larger values of wealth.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Multi-agent models of closed economy systems have received considerable attention in recent years due to the
fact that they seem to predict realistic shapes of wealth distribution from very simple underlying dynamics, basically
equivalent to kinetic theory of ideal gases in classical statistical mechanics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
A notable plus-point of these simple models is represented by the ability to reproduce the main features of the empirical
wealth distributions: a Boltzmann distribution at intermediate values of wealth, and a power law at the highest values
(see e.g. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]). The power law form in the tail of the distribution was observed more than a century ago
by the economist Vilfredo Pareto [21], who found that the wealth of individuals in a stable economy has a cumulative
distribution F (x) ∝ x−α, where α, the Pareto exponent, has usually a value between 1 and 2.

In these models N agents interact exchanging a quantity x, which can be interpreted as representing any economic
entity contributing to the agent wealth, expressed in the same unit of measure, e.g. in monetary units. Depending on
the parameters of the kinetic model, in particular on the values of the saving propensities {λi} (i = 1, . . . , N ) of the
N agents, the equilibrium wealth distribution can be a simple Boltzmann distribution for λi ≡ 0 [1, 2, 5], a Gamma
distribution with a similar exponential tail but a well deﬁned mode xm > 0 for λi ≡ λ0 > 0 [6, 7], or a distribution
with a power law tail for randomly distributed λi [8, 10]. It has been recently recognized [10, 15] that the observed
power law arises from the overlap of Gamma distributions, resulting from (subsets of) agents with similar values of λ.
That is, in systems where saving propensity is distributed according to an arbitrary distribution function f (λ), agents
relax individually toward Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, similarly to systems with a global saving propensity λ0,
but with the important diﬀerence that in this case the various Gamma distributions with diﬀerent λ0 parameters will
overlap and provide the ﬁnal (power law) equilibrium distribution.

The aim of the present paper is to further investigate the relation between the saving propensity distribution and
the shape of the ﬁnal equilibrium wealth distribution, with particular attention to reproduce a realistic distribution.
In Sec. II we recall the main features of kinetic multi-agent models, while in Sec. III we consider how the equilibrium
distribution is aﬀected by a particular choice of the parameters of the saving propensity distribution and provide some
examples. Results are summarized in Sec. IV.

II. KINETIC MULTI-AGENT MODELS

In kinetic multi-agent models N agents interact with each other through a pair interaction – but this is only one
of the many possibilities – exchanging a quantity x, generally referred to as “wealth” in the following. Agents are
characterized by their current wealths {xi}, i = 1, 2, . . . , N and, possibly, by some parameters, such as the saving
propensity λi. The evolution of the system is then carried out in the following way. At every time step two agents i
and j are extracted randomly and an amount of wealth ∆x is exchanged between them,

It can be noticed that in this way the quantity x is conserved during the single transactions, x′
i and x′
x′

j are the agent wealths after the transaction has taken place.

i + x′

j = xi + xj , where

In the basic versions of the model the quantity x represents money and ∆x the money exchanged, assumed to have

a constant value [1, 2, 3],

or to be proportional to the initial values [5],

where ǫ is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 and ¯ǫ = 1−ǫ. The form of ∆x in Eq. (3) represents
a random reshuﬄing of the wealths of the two agents [5], since Eq. (1) can in this case be rewritten as

These dynamics rules, together with the constraint that transactions can take place only if x′
to an equilibrium state characterized by an exponential Boltzmann distribution,

i > 0 and x′

j > 0, lead

f (x) = hxi−1

exp(−x/ hxi) ,

where the eﬀective temperature Tλ of the system is just the average wealth (see curve λ = 0 in Fig. 1). Despite
its intrinsic simplicity, the basic model has the merit of having shown that economic interactions can be modeled in
terms of simple statistical mechanisms leading to corresponding universal statistical laws.

2. Models with a global saving propensity

A ﬁrst generalization toward a more realistic model is based on the introduction of a saving criterion. Agents save
a fraction λ (the saving propensity, with 0 < λ < 1) before entering a trade and only exchange the remaining fraction
(1 − λ) of their wealth, [6, 7]:

corresponding to a ∆x in Eq. (1) given by

x′
i = λxi + ǫ(1 − λ)(xi + xj ) ,
x′
j = λxj + ¯ǫ(1 − λ)(xi + xj) ,

∆x = (1 − λ)[¯ǫxi − ǫxj] .

The corresponding equilibrium distribution is well ﬁtted by the gamma distribution [12, 13]

f (ξ) =

1
Γ(Dλ/2)

ξDλ/2−1 exp(−ξ) ≡ γDλ/2(ξ) ,

as shown in Fig. 1. Here the dimensionless variable

is just the variable x rescaled with respect to the eﬀective temperature Tλ and

.

The parameter Dλ plays the role of an eﬀective dimension, since the Gamma distribution γn(ξ) given by Eq. (8) is
identical to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energy for a system of molecules at temperature Tλ in Dλ
dimensions (of course only for integer or half-integer values of n = Dλ/2) [13, 15]. In further support of this analogy,
it is worth noting that Tλ and Dλ are related to each other through an “equipartition theorem”,

The equivalence between kinetic theory and closed economy models, suggested by the basic version of the kinetic
multi-agent models [1, 2, 3, 5], can thus be extended to values λ ≥ 0 [15], as summarized in Table I.

While λ varies between 0 and 1, the eﬀective dimension Dλ increases monotonically between 2 and ∞. In fact in a
higher number of dimensions the fraction of kinetic energy exchanged between particles during a collision is smaller.
At the same time, the market temperature Tλ decreases with increasing λ, signaling smaller ﬂuctuations of x during
trades, consistently with the presence of a saving criterion, i.e. λ > 0. One can notice that Tλ = (1 − λ) hxi /(1 + 2λ) ≈
(1 − λ) hxi is on average the amount of wealth exchanged during an interaction between agents, see Eqs. (6).

power law breaking down as the distance between consecutive partial distributions becomes comparable with their width.

3. Models with a continuous distributions of saving propensity

As a further generalization, various investigations concerned models in which agents have realistically been diversi-
ﬁed from each other by assigning them diﬀerent saving propensities λi [8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 22]. In particular, uniformly
distributed λi in the interval (0,1) have been studied numerically in Refs. [8, 10]. This model is described by the
trading rule

or, equivalently, by a ∆x – as deﬁned in Eq. (1) – given by

x′
i = λixi + ǫ[(1 − λi)xi + (1 − λj)xj ] ,
x′
j = λxj + ¯ǫ[(1 − λi)xi + (1 − λj)xj ] ,

∆x = ¯ǫ(1 − λi)xi − ǫ(1 − λj)xj .

f (x) = x−α−1 ,

One of the main features of this model, which is supported by theoretical considerations [11, 14, 22], is that the wealth
distribution exhibits a robust power law at large values of x,

with a Pareto exponent α = 1 largely independent of the details of the λi-distribution. As remarked in Ref. [10], the
wealth distribution of the single agents are not of a power law type but have a well deﬁned mode and an exponential
tail, similarly to the case a global saving propensity λ0. The power law actually results from the overlap of these partial
distributions corresponding to the various λ’s, which are Gamma distributions, whose average value is proportional
to 1/(1 − λ) and thus extend to very large values of x [15]. These results are also in agreement with theoretical
approaches to kinetic multi-agent models [11, 14, 22]. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Arbitrarily small (random) irregularities in the distance between two consecutive values of λ close enough to 1, in a
uniform distribution of saving propensity, are ampliﬁed in the wealth distribution as a consequence of the correlation
between average wealth and saving propensity, resulting in isolated peaks in the wealth distribution [15]. This is
shown by the simple example in Fig. 3, where two distributions, in principle equivalent to each other since associated
to a uniform λ-distribution in (0,1), look actually quite diﬀerent: The ﬁrst distribution (left) has been obtained by
randomly extracting the values of λ with a random number generator in the interval (0,1). It can be noticed that
the corresponding equilibrium wealth distribution is more irregular than that obtained from the second distribution
(right), in which the values λi were set to be equidistant from each other in the interval (0,1) by deﬁning them as
λi = i/N . The deterministic and random uniform distributions are equivalent to each other in principle but not
in practice (within numerical simulations), where a ﬁnite number of agents is necessarily used. The reason is that
the λ values extracted randomly present ﬂuctuations and therefore wider intervals between neighbor values which
are ampliﬁed in the ﬁnal wealth distribution. Since in these numerical simulations one tries to mimic continuous
distributions by use of the smallest possible number of variables, it is convenient to avoid the irregular ﬂuctuations
present in randomly extracted sets of numbers and use a deterministically extracted sets {λi} of saving propensities.
This can be achieved easily with the method prescribed in Appendix A.

distributions of λ: A randomly generated λ-distribution (left) produces a wealth distribution which is more irregular than a

III. CONSTRUCTION OF A REALISTIC MODEL

Here we study how some aspects of the λ-distribution f (λ) inﬂuence the equilibrium form of the wealth distribution
f (x), i.e. its shape at smaller and the tail at larger values of x, and in particular under which conditions an exponential
and a power law can appear in diﬀerent ranges of the same distribution.

A. Wealth distribution at small and intermediate values of wealth

The equilibrium distribution of the basic model is the simple exponential function in Eq. (5). Such a form of
distribution decreases monotonously with x and does not have rich agents nor a power law tail, a point dealt with in
greater detail in the next section. In the small x limit, the exponential distribution is f (x → 0) > 0 which implies
that many agents have a wealth x ≈ 0. In fact the mode of the distribution is xm = 0 and the fraction of agents
outside a given interval (0, x) – which is just the upper cumulative distribution function – has a pure exponential
form, F (x) = exp(−x/ hxi). Real data about wealth and income distributions, on the other hand, show that wealth
distribution functions have a mode xm > 0 [17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. The introduction of a (global) saving propensity
λ > 0 solves this problem [6] since it leads to an equilibrium Gamma distribution [12, 13], which has a mode xm > 0
and a zero limit for x → 0, see Fig. 1. This functional form has been shown to interpolate well real data about income
distributions at small and intermediate values [16, 17, 26, 27].

B. The tail of the wealth distribution

The tail of wealth distributions is known to follow a power law with Pareto exponent between 1 and 2, depending on
the sample analyzed. The model under consideration, when saving propensities are continuously distributed, predicts
a power law tail in f (x), despite with a lower Pareto exponent α = 1, a feature which has been shown to be very
robust and independent of the details of f (λ).

Both numerical and theoretical analyzes of kinetic multi-agent models show that agents with large values of λ’s
(i.e. λ close to 1) give a major contribution to the power law tail. This is illustrated e.g. by the fact that when
the power law is decomposed into partial distributions of agents within a given interval of the saving propensity, the
partial distribution corresponding to the interval with the highest λ is in turn a power law, while the distributions
corresponding to lower values of λ are localized and have an exponential tail, as shown in Fig. 2. However, they sum
up to give a power law at lower values of x. All this suggests that the crucial factor for having a power law extending
beyond a certain value x is the highest λ present in the sample, that is the cutoﬀ of the λ-distribution.

Thus, rather than varying the functional form of f (λ), the inﬂuence of the cut-oﬀ λM of the λ-distribution – which is
a parameter characterizing numerical simulations as well as real systems – has been analyzed. A uniform deterministic

as described in greater detail in Appendix A.

In fact we found that varying the cutoﬀ λM inﬂuences in turn the cut-oﬀ of the wealth distribution f (x) and the
shape of the distribution at small x – but not the shape of the tail which remains a power law with exponent α = 1.
Decreasing λM has the eﬀect to decrease the interval of wealth x in which the power law appears, until it eventually
disappears for λM ≈ 0.92. Results are shown in Fig. 4, where the various curves represent the distribution functions
obtained for some values of the cutoﬀ λM chosen in the interval λM = (0.9, 0.9999) in a system of 105 agents. Curves
from left to right correspond to increasing values of cutoﬀ. The transition from an exponential to a power law form
of the wealth distribution, as the cut-oﬀ λM decreases, takes place by a shrinking of the power law interval, rather
than as a change of the functional form of the tail.

As a ﬁnal remark it is to be noted that the cutoﬀ of the λ-distribution is naturally linked to that of the x-distribution,

as a consequence of the correlation existing between average wealth hxi and saving propensity [15] in this model,

Here the constant on the right hand side of the equation is the same number for all the agents in the system. This
relation clearly shows that the highest average wealth is determined in turn by the highest λi.

hxii (1 − λi) = const .

C.

Superposing an exponential form at intermediate values and a power law tail

In real wealth distributions, an exponential form at intermediate values of wealth is known to coexist with a power
law tail at larger values [27]. The power law is mainly due to a small percentage of population, of the order of a few
per cent, while the majority of the population with smaller average wealth give rise to the exponential part of the
distribution. In this section we try to construct a realistic example of such a type of wealth distribution by collecting
some of the results obtained so far:

• A global saving propensity λ0 is associated to an equilibrium Gamma distribution, which always has an expo-

nential tail.

• A set of agents with a continuous λ-distribution produces a power law in the equilibrium wealth distribution.

FIG. 5: Numerical equilibrium wealth distribution of a population of 105 agents. One per cent (1000) of the agents have
uniformly distributed saving propensities in the interval (0,1), while the rest have λ = 0. Left (semi-log scale): Small x part

Numerical distribution (continuous line) compared with a power law ∝ x−2 (dashed line) and the same exponential function of
the left ﬁgure (dotted line). Peaks at high x are due to the ﬁnite resolution in λ, see Fig. 2 for an explanation of their origin.

• The average wealth hxii of an agent and the corresponding saving propensity λi are linked to each other through

Eq. (16), which implies that agents with high λ ≈ 1 contribute to the large-x part of the distribution.

It is then natural to ask if a suitable λ-distribution may lead to the desired equilibrium wealth distribution. To answer
this question we have constructed a hybrid λ-distribution – on the base of the results listed above and a very similar
prescription mentioned in Ref. [8]– in the following way:

• A small fraction of agents p0 with saving propensities λi uniformly distributed in the interval (0,1) according to

Eq. (A3).

• The remaining fraction 1 − p0 with a constant value of the saving propensity λ0.

The corresponding distribution for p0 = 0.01 (1 per cent) and λ0 = 0 is shown in Fig. 5, both in the small x-scale,
where the distribution has an exponential shape, and in the long x-range, where the power law with exponent −2,
which characterizes this type of multi-agent model, is observed.

It is noteworthy that the coexistence of an exponential and a power law tail is possible only for small values of p0,
in agreement with the fact that it is a small percentage of the population in real systems that is responsible of the
power law form of wealth distribution at large values of wealths. For larger values of p0 the exponential part shrinks
and the power law dominates. This eﬀect is in a sense contrary to that considered in Sec. II 3, where decreasing the
cutoﬀ of the λ-distribution induced a shrinking of the power law range.

It may be noticed that, due to the choice λ0 = 0 for that part of agents with a constant saving propensity, the
distribution in Fig. 5 still has a mode xm = 0. However, one recovers a distribution with a well deﬁned mode xm > 0
as soon as one chooses a λ0 6= 0. The distribution in Fig. 6 corresponds to a λ0 = 0.2 for 99% of the agents and a
uniform λ-distribution for the remaining agents.

D. Meaning of the saving propensity

The central role of the saving propensity λ – or risk aversion as referred to in Ref. [9] – for the considerations made
above is evident. However, it is to be remarked that the relation between saving propensity λi of an agent and the
corresponding average wealth hxii should not considered to be of a cause-eﬀect type. It is true that in the present
model the λi’s are ﬁxed parameters, so that the natural dynamical interpretation is that the saving propensity λ
determines the ﬁnal average wealth. However, in a real situation the value of λ itself may vary according to various
factors, e.g. the wealth itself: a high average wealth probably puts the agent in a situation which allows to carry on
trades investing the same amount of wealth while saving more respect to agents with smaller wealths. Therefore, the
model contains in its very dynamics a positive correlation between λ and hxi supported by real data [28] but leaves

the question of the actual dynamical relation between them to a more detailed microscopic analysis. Multi-agents
models like that considered here describe ﬂux of wealth on a mesoscopic level, i.e. on a coarse grained scale in time
or wealth, rather than reﬂecting the single agent strategy to save or reduce risks.

We have shown that within the framework of kinetic multi-agent models it is possible to obtain realistic wealth
distributions f (x) characterized by a zero limit for small x, and the coexistence of an exponential form at intermediate
and power law tail at larger values of x. In agreement with observations on real systems, this is possible only if the
percentage of rich agents does not exceed a critical threshold of the order of 1 per cent. Also, the model naturally
produces a positive correlation between average wealth hxi and saving propensity λ exhibited in real data samples.

APPENDIX A: EXTRACTION OF A VARIABLE λ WITH CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION F (λ)

It is possible to deﬁne a sequence of N numbers λi, i = 1, . . . , N , which becomes distributed according to an
arbitrary distribution function f (λ) = dF (λ)/dλ in the continuous limit (N → ∞), in at least two ways, randomly
or deterministically. The two methods are equivalent to each other only in the continuous limit, while in numerical
simulations a ﬁnite N is necessarily employed and they may provide diﬀerent results. As discussed in Sec. II 3, in
some cases it may be preferable to have a regular, rather than a randomly extracted sequence.

• Random extraction. A generator of random numbers φ, 0 < φ < 1, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1,
can be employed to extract a set of numbers λi distributed in the continuous limit according to an arbitrary
cumulative distribution function F (λ), with F (0) = 0 and F (1) = 1. The cumulative distribution function for
the random variable φ is simply F (φ) = φ and dF ≡ dφ is the (constant) probability to extract the next random

number between φ and φ + dφ. The algorithm is based on the identity dφ = dF = f (λ)dλ, which shows that if
values Fi are extracted randomly and uniformly in the interval (0,1), then the corresponding values λi obtained
by inverting F = F (λi) will be distributed with probability density f (λ).

• Deterministic extraction The same result can be obtained by a deterministic assignment of the values λi which
does not make use of random number generators. If the sequence {λi} is assumed to be labeled in increasing
order, i.e. 0 ≤ λ1 < λ2 < · · · < λN ≤ 1, then the function of i

increases monotonously with i and it is possible to invert it to express i as a function of λi to deﬁne the function

λ(i) = λi ,

F (λi) =

i
N

,

which represents the fraction of agents with saving propensity less or equal to λi: F (λ) is just the (lower)
cumulative distribution function and as such 0 < F (λ) < 1 for every λ, F (λ → 0) → 0, and F (λ → 1) → 1.
For instance the cumulative distribution function of a uniformly distributed variable λ in the interval λ ∈ (0, 1)
is just the linear function F (λ) = λ, with 0 < λ < 1. Then Eq. (A2) provides the corresponding deterministic
sequence as

λi =

i
N

,

i = 1, . . . , N .

If there is an upper cutoﬀ λM in the distribution, the equation is modiﬁed as in (15). In the general case of a
given cumulative function F (λ), it is suﬃcient to invert Eq. (A2) to obtain the sequence in the form λi = λ(i/N ),
i = 1, . . . , N , where λ(. . . ) is the inverse function of F (. . . ). The values λi thus obtained will be distributed in
the continuous limit with a probability distribution f (λ) = dF (λ)/dλ.

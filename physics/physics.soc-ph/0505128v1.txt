Abstract

We study spatial embeddings of random graphs in which nodes are randomly
distributed in geographical space. We let the edge probability between any two
nodes to be dependent on the spatial distance between them and demonstrate
that this model captures many generic properties of social networks, including
the “small-world” properties, skewed degree distribution, and most distinctively
the existence of community structures.

1 Introduction

Complex social networks arise in a wide range of contexts, for example as corporate
partnership networks [22], scientist collaboration networks [30], company director net-
works [41], ﬁlm actors networks [3], sexual contact networks [26], etc. Indeed, a lot of
attention has been given by both physical and social scientists in recent years to model
these networks so as to gain better understandings of their general structures as well
as their various functions like information ﬂow [18], locating individuals [1], disease
spread [26], etc. For a review of recent eﬀorts, see for example [40], [2] and [31]. While
there is an apparent increase in the number of network models in the literature, not all
of these models have taken full advantage of the sociological and psychological insights
on how social networks may be formed.

1.1 Spatial characteristics of social ties

The principle of homophily, or in essence “birds of a feather ﬂock together,” has been
ﬁrmly established by many empirical studies [24]. While we clearly tend to befriend
those who are like us, there are many situations where having a lot of friends like us

is simply because we are stuck with people who are like us in the ﬁrst place. For
example if you are a millionaire and all your friends are millionaires, it might simply
be because you were born into an elite family and live in an elite area so you only
know millionaires in your life, even though you do not actively choose to befriend
millionaires over non-millionaires. Therefore, it is useful to divide homophily into two
main types: baseline homophily and inbreeding homophily [24]. Baseline homophily
is attributed to the fact that we have a limited potential tie pool due to factors like
demography and foci of activities [13]. Inbreeding homophily is conceptualised as any
other kind of homophily measured over that potential tie pool — this may include
homophily regarding gender, religion, social class, education, and other intra-personal
or behavioural characteristics. While many network models have taken inbreeding
homophily into account [51, 42, 33, 32, 43, 46], they have generally assumed that there
are no baseline homophily eﬀects, i.e. the potential tie pool for all actors equals the
entire population. However, this is obviously not very realistic and baseline homophily
eﬀects can potentially have profound consequences on the structure of social networks.
A basic source of baseline homophily is the geographical space. As a matter of
simple opportunity and/or the need to minimise eﬀorts to form and maintain a social
tie [54], we can expect that we tend to form ties with those who are geographically
close to us. Thus, intuitively, this creates a very strong constraint on our potential
tie pool. In fact, there is ample empirical evidence that demonstrates this claim. The
earliest studies of which we are aware of date back to Festinger et al. [14] and Caplow
and Forman [9] both on student housing communities. The results showed that in
these rather homogeneous communities, spatial arrangement of student rooms/units
was an important factor in predicting whether two dwellers have at least weak ties.
Many other network studies also reached similar results, for example see [4, 5]. More
recently, Wellman [48] and Mok et al. [27] re-analysed Wellman’s earlier dataset on
Torontorian personal communities [49, 50] and noted that most personal friendships
were indeed “local,” contrary to the beliefs that recent technological advances have
freed us from spatial constraints. For instance, in [49] it was found that on average
42% of “frequent contact” ties live within a mere 1 mile radius of a typical person,
while the rest of his/her ties could be directed to anywhere in the rest of the world.

1.2 General features of social networks

Before embarking on specifying the model, we shall review some of the general features
of social networks. Not many current models simultaneously displays all of these. We
suggest that, by including baseline spatial homophily into our network model, one can
reproduce all the following features, at least in broad terms:

1. Low tie density. The number of possible ties in a network is theoretically
quadratic to the number of actors, but most networks realise only a tiny fraction
of these ties. The cognitive ability of human places an upper bound on the number
of ties one may maintain [11]. On the other hand, other factors corresponding to
baseline homophily can also play a role [13];

2. Short average geodesic distances. Geodesic distance between two actors is
deﬁned to be the length of the shortest connection between them. In large social
networks, it is believed that the typical geodesic distance between any two actors
remains small. This property was demonstrated empirically by Stanley Milgram

2

in his classical experiment in the 1960s [25], contributing to the popular saying
that no one on this earth is separated from you by more than six “handshakes”;

3. High level of clustering. Clustering is deﬁned to be the average probability
that two friends of an actor are themselves friends. Equivalently, it is a measure
of how having a mutual friend will heighten the conditional probability that the
two friends of an actor will be friends themselves. In their well-known article [47],
Watts and Strogatz demonstrated the importance of short-cuts in social networks
that simultaneously display high clustering and short average geodesic distances.
Such an idea of short-cuts dates back to Granovetter’s arguments on the strength
of weak ties [16];

4. Positively skewed actor degree distribution. The degree of an actor is the
number of social ties he/she has. In many social networks, a majority of actors
have relatively small degrees, while a small number of actors may have very large
degrees. This feature is displayed in a wide range of social networks. While it
is still debated whether generic social networks have power-law, exponential, or
other degree distributions, or indeed whether there is any generic distribution
at all [17], there is no doubt that degree distributions are in general positively
skewed;

5. Existence of communities. In many cases, clustering does not occur evenly
over the entire network. We can often observed subgroups of actors who are highly
connected within themselves but loosely connected to other subgroups which are
themselves highly inter-connected. We call these highly-connected subgroups
communities [28]. A long tradition in social network analysis has developed a
range of algorithms to identify these cohesive subsets of nodes [52].

An example of a social network that displays all of the above properties is a well-
known alliance network of 16 tribes in the Eastern Central Highlands of New Guinea
[39]1. The network is depicted in Fig. 1 where nodes correspond to tribes and ties
correspond to alliances between the relevant tribes. First of all, the density of the
network is fairly low (ρ = 0.24) given the small size of the network. The degree
distribution is positively skewed (skewness statistic = 0.99). The network is a “small
world” in which it has low median geodesic distance (2) and high level of clustering
coeﬃcient (clustering coeﬃcient = 0.63). Most importantly, two distinct communities
can be easily observed in Fig. 1: one is disjoint from the rest and is fully connected
(i.e. Nodes 1, 2, 15, and 16) and the other is highly connected within itself (i.e. Nodes
3, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12).

1.3 Random graph models

We here represent social networks by non-directed graphs. A non-directed graph is
deﬁned to be a pair (V, E), where V = {v1, v2, . . . , vN } is the node set denoting the
individual actors in the network, and E = {e1, e2, . . . , eM }, with each edge ei being an
unordered pair of nodes ei = (vr, rs) (r 6= s and vr,s ∈ V), is the edge set denoting
the social ties among the actors. A compact way to represent a graph is through its

adjacency matrix X = [xij], i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N} such that xij = 1 iﬀ (vi, vj) ∈ E,
otherwise xij = 0. In general, the size of the set V (or equivalently the dimensions
of X) is ﬁxed but whether an edge (vi, vj)t ∈ E (or equivalently xij = 1 in X) is
determined by a random process. Such a random process is deﬁned so as to reﬂect the
underlying social dynamics.

The simplest model for social networks is the Erd¨os-R´enyi or Bernoulli random
graph model, initiated independently by Paul Erd¨os and Alfred R´enyi [12] and Anatol
Rapaport [38], where the random process is a Bernoulli trial, i.e.

1, with probability p
0, with probability 1 − p

,

xij =

(cid:26)

(1)

where the constant p ∈ [0, 1] is called the edge probability.
In other words xij are
identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables. Due to
its simplicity, it is amenable to rigorous treatments. It is fairly straightforward to show
that the average geodesic distance between any two nodes is hriji ∼ ln N, a feature
that, as discussed above, resembles the property in some real networks. However the
level of clustering in this model can be shown to vanish as N → ∞ and it is one of
the major short-comings of this simple model in modelling social networks. Further,
Erd¨os and R´enyi showed that there is a critical edge probability pc ≈ N −1 at which
there always exists a connected component containing a signiﬁcant proportion of nodes
in the network (almost surely) [7]. Such component is known as the giant component.
For an extensive review of these results refer to Bollob´as [7] and Janson et al. [20].

1.4 The overview

The main advantage of the Erd¨os-R´enyi model is its simplicity. Although it does not
predict some of the generic features outlined above, it serves as a good foundation to
build more realistic models. In this paper, we study a generalisation of Erd¨os-R´enyi
random graph model for social networks which incorporates a simple baseline spatial
homophily eﬀect in the formation of individual network ties. We note that this class
of models is for a single snapshot of a network, thus temporal network dynamics are
not taken into account. In Section 2, we shall specify the model and examine some of
its basic properties. In Section 3, we shall outline our simulation methods and discuss
the main results. In Section 4, we shall demonstrate the application of our model in a
particular social network. In Section 5, we shall discuss the implications of the results
and describe ongoing research on this and more generalised models.

2 Spatial random graph model

First of all, we embedded the nodes of graphs in the Euclidean space R2 with a distance
function d deﬁned to map any unordered pair of nodes to a real number, i.e. d :
R2 × R2 → R. Further, d satisﬁes the standard triangle inequalities and the positivity
condition. Every node vi is assigned a coordinate (xi, yi)t according to some spatial
distribution and we deﬁne χ = {(x1, y1)t, (x2, y2)t, . . .} to be the location vector that
speciﬁcs the spatial locations of all nodes in a network. Further we shall use the
shorthand dij = d((xi, yi)t, (xj, yj)t) to denote the distance between nodes vi and vj.
Next, we assume that the spatial locations of the nodes are randomly scattered in

4

space (and therefore all locations are mutually independent as well). In other words,
we assumed that the points are distributed in space according to a homogeneous Poisson
point process (see for example [10, 21]). Recall that a Poisson point process with rate
ρ < ∞ in the d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd is a process such that:

• for all disjoint subsets A1, A2, . . . , Ak ⊂ Rd, the random variable denoting the
number of point in the each subset, N(A1), N(A2), . . . , N(Ak), are independently
distributed;

• N(A) has Poisson distribution; and

• E[N(A)] = ρ|A| for all A ⊂ Rd.

(2)

(3)

To model the baseline homophily eﬀect, we let the edge probability between two
nodes to be dependent on the spatial distance between them. That is, given a χ,
P (xij = 1|χ) = f (dij), where f : R → [0, 1]. Motivated by the discussion in the last
section, we shall consider the case where f is a simple step function, i.e.

P (xij = 1|χ) =

p + pb,
p − ∆,

if dij ≤ H,
if dij > H,

(cid:26)

where p is the average density of the network, H is the neighbourhood radius, pb is the
proximity bias which speciﬁes the sensitivity to geographical space by the actors on
establishing social links. Thus pb probabilistically controls the locations of potential tie
pool. Of course we have assumed that such a spatial sensitivity is the same for all actors
in the network. Further, ∆ = ∆(pb, H|χ) is some correction term. The correction term
∆ is introduced to maintain the expected average density to be a constant p, given χ,
for all feasible values of H and pb, i.e.

and there is no other substantive purpose. Without maintaining constant density, it
will be diﬃcult to isolate the eﬀects of pb and H on the graph’s structural properties
because of the confounding eﬀects from the varying expected number of edges in the
model.

To calculate ∆, we ﬁrst determine the number of all possible edges shorter than
the neighbourhood radius H in the network embedded in χ, call this number S≤H(χ);
when N is suﬃciently large (ignoring boundary eﬀects), S≤H(χ) ≈ Nπρ2/2. The
number of possible edges longer than the neighbourhood radius is therefore S>H(χ) =
N
− S≤H(χ). By deﬁnition the expected density within neighbourhoods is p + pb, so
2
the expected number of all realised edges within all neighbourhoods is (p + pb)S≤H. It
(cid:0)
follows that, in order to maintain density to equal p, the expected number of realised
edges outside the neighbourhood ought to be

p − (p + pb)S≤H. As a result,

0 ≤ p − ∆ ≤ 1. These conditions deﬁnes upper and lower bounds for pb given a p and

and
pb = 1 − p, i.e. when there is probability 1 that all pair of nodes less than distance
H apart will be joint and probability 0 otherwise, this model becomes the so-called
random geometric graph model [37]3. A typical instance of spatial random graph can
be found in Fig. 2.

It is convenient to express our model in the exponential form which ﬁts into the
exponential random graph network modelling framework. More details of the frame-
work can be found in Wasserman and Pattison [15, 53]. The modelling framework has
recently received renewed attention in the physics community, see [8] and [34] . Let x
be an instance of random graph with spatial locations of nodes speciﬁed by χ. Then
the general form of the probability function for obtaining x is given by

where H(x|χ) is the Hamiltonian of graph x given the locations of nodes speciﬁed by
χ and

P (X = x|χ) =

is the partition function of the model. The Hamiltonian can take any (sensible) form
to reﬂect the dependency of edges. The simplest choice is −H(x) = θ0L(x|χ), where
L(x|χ) = L(x) is the number of edges in the graph x independent of χ and θ0 is its
associated parameter. By tuning θ0, we can change the expected density of a typical
graph in the model. This gives us the classical Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph model [12]
as introduced in Section 1. To deﬁne H(x|χ) for our simple spatial model, we ﬁrst
deﬁne L≤(x|χ) =
i<j,dij>H xij be the number of edges
shorter and longer than H respectively, then the Hamiltonian for our model can be
written as

i<j,dij≤H xij and L>(x|χ) =

P

P

−H(x|χ) = θ≤L≤(x|χ) + θ>L>(x|χ),

where θ≤ and θ> are parameters whose values can be calculated directly from Eq. 2,
i.e.

θ≤ = logit(p + pb),

and

θ> = logit(p − ∆),

where logit q = log[q/(1 − q)]. Equivalently, we can also write the Hamiltonian in
another form: −H(x|χ) = θL(x|χ)+θ′L≤(x|χ), where L(x|χ) =
i<j xij (= L≤(x|χ)+
number of nodes within a node’s neighbourhood (not including itself) be E[s≤H ], we can then repeat
the above and arrive at a simpler form for the correction term,

3We also later become aware of a generalisation of the random geometric graph model called the
random connection model where the edge probability is taken to be a general decreasing function of
spatial distance, g [36]. In [36], some rigorous results regarding the giant cluster on the model has
been obtained, however, the main variable of their model is the Poisson rate ρ in space while keeping
g general. However here our focus on the function g.

former form of the Hamiltonian.

The simplicity of the Hamiltonian allows us to write down the partition function

However, as is the case in many other statistical mechanics models, equations like Eq.
11 are very diﬃcult to evaluate exactly as a general approach in not yet available.
In this study, we resort to using numerical simulations to explore the properties our
model.

3 Simulation results and discussions

The Poisson rate ρ and the neighbourhood radius are relative to each other, so we shall
always ﬁx ρ = 1 and vary H only. On the other hand, the choice of the value of H is
not crucial as long as H is suﬃciently large. When H is too small, the vast majority
of ties connected to a node are inevitably from the outside of the neighbourhood,
therefore, the model behaves as the simple Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph model. Here we
ﬁx H = 3/2. The main program of simulations below is to vary the proximity bias pb
and investigate the eﬀects on the overall structures of the graphs. We used a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method outlined in Snijders [44] for all our simulations. Each
individual data point below is a result of a simulation run (250, 000 Markov iterations)

7

of random graphs with 100 nodes on a ﬁxed χ. The burn-in phase for each run is
about 30, 000 iterations and statistics from this phase were removed before further
analysis. The estimates of the statistics are then calculated as the simple averages in
the post-burn-in phase. And we collect the estimates for six realisations of χ.

3.1 Number of short and long edges

In Fig. 3, we plot the average number of edges shorter than (hL≤(x)i) and longer than
(hL>(x)i) the neighbourhood radius; we called them short and long edges respectively.
When pb = 0, the opportunity tie pool of each node equals the entire population
In this case, since there are many more potential long edges than
(except itself).
short edges in the graph, the graphs are on average dominated by long edges. As
pb increase, the potential tie pool of each node concentrate more and more on the
population geographically close, so short edges dominate. The two scatter plots in Fig.
3 clearly display linear opposing trends. The linearity is simply a result of our model
deﬁnition, refer to Eq. 2. Also as pb increases, there is growing variance of statistics for
ﬁxed pb. It is because as the diﬀerence between short edge probability and long edge
probability grows, the graphs are more and more dependent on the conﬁguration of the
speciﬁc instance of the point process. However, as pb approaches 1 − p, the variability
decreases again. It is because the large pb values place signiﬁcant constraints on the
feasible instances of the point process and thus only a small number of instances χ are
feasible for large pb (see Eq. 4).

3.2 Small-world properties

Let us now investigate the eﬀect of pb on the global structure of the graphs. First
let us deﬁne the geodesic distance, or graph distance, between two nodes. Note that
this distance is independent of the spatial distance between the nodes involved. Given
a graph X = {xij}, let the geodesic distance between vi and vj, lij(X), be length of
the shortest self-avoiding path connecting vi and vj. If vi and vj are disconnected, we
assign lij = ∞. Now, given a χ, deﬁne

w(X) =

(cid:19)

to be the (harmonic) mean of lij(X) over all possible pairs on nodes in X. w(X) is
a simple measure of connectivity of G. Refer to the upper part of Fig. 4 for a plot
of hw(X)i against pb. From the plot, hw(X)i remains small for a large range of pb.
Then there appears to be a critical pb, as in the Watts-Strogatz model [47], that w
dramatically increases. This indicates a switch from the simple random graph regime,
where “short-cuts” between neighbourhood are abundant, to the random geometric
graph regime, where most edges are within each actor’s neighbourhood.

Further, we study the level of clustering in the model. Let t1(X) be the number
i<j<k xijxjkxik. Also
i<j<k xijxik. Then we

C(X) measures the overall level of clustering in a network or in other words how
much on average an actor’s friend’s friends are also the actor’s friends. By deﬁnition,
0 ≤ C(X) ≤ 1 for all X. Refer to Fig. 4 for a plot of the average hCi over all X in
the ensemble as we changes pb. This model also display similar behaviours as in the
Watts-Strogatz model, and there is a steady increase in its value as pb increases. The
source of this clustering is entirely spatial, i.e. triangles are likely to be formed simply
because of the fact that the involved nodes are closed to each other spatially.

Overall, there is a range of pb where the model display simultaneously relatively low
average path length and signiﬁcant level of clustering — a signature of a “small-world”
model.

3.3 Community structures

Although the clustering coeﬃcient deﬁned above measures the overall level of clustering
in a graph, there is the question of whether clustering is distributed evenly over the
entire graph on average, in other words, do the triangles in the graph tend to clump
together or not? The “clumpiness” of triangles can be measured by the number of
higher-order triangles. A 2-triangle is deﬁned to be the combination of two triangles
In general, a k-triangle is
sharing a common edge (which is called the base edge).
deﬁned to be the combination of k triangles all sharing a common base edge and let
tk(X) its number in X. Let gij(G) be the number of two-paths connecting vi and
vj, then a useful and convenient way to combine all tk(G) into a single measure is as
follows:

where λ is an arbitrary constant. For a detailed discussion of the motivation for this
deﬁnition, see [45]. A plot of hTλ(X)i for λ = 2 against pb can be found in Figure
5. There we can see a steady increase in T2(X) as pb increases. This suggests that
graphs have higher tendencies on average to form clumps of triangles — we call these
clumps communities — for large pb.
Inspection of instances of graphs when pb is
large suggests that the delineation of communities are determined by large gaps in the
spatial distribution of the nodes. This happens in spite of that fact that the nodes
are distributed uniformly randomly in space. This phenomena can be compared with
the observation that communities are likely to be separated by large streets, railroad
tracks, etc [23].

Now that we have shown that a typical graph in the model is likely to have strong
community structures when pb is reasonably large. One possible implication of having
such kind of structures is that the whole graph can be composed of disjoint commu-
nities. To detect whether it is the case, we consider the average size of the largest
connected component over the ensemble. We deﬁne the component size containing
node vi, γi(X), to be the number of nodes with ﬁnite path length from vi (including
itself), i.e. γi(G) =

i<j δ(lij < ∞), where δ is the normal delta function. Let

to be the number of nodes of X in largest component over all vi. We have plotted the
hΓ(X)i against pb in Fig. 6. When pb is small, a vast majority of nodes is contained
in the largest component. As pb increases, there is a higher chance that the largest
component no longer contains most nodes, leaving a signiﬁcant proportion of nodes in
smaller isolated components. The instance of network in Fig. 2 is an example of such
a situation.

3.4 Actor degree distributions

Fig. 7 shows the average degree distribution of graphs for various values of pb. They
are all positively skewed and as pb increases the corresponding degree distribution
has an increasingly fatter tail. As pb becomes very large, the distribution becomes a
bimodal distribution. This is due to the boundary eﬀect where nodes near the spatial
boundary of the graph are disadvantaged by having less possible neighbours within
their neighbourhood radius. This is conﬁrmed by the studying the correlation between
the spatial distance of nodes from the centre of a typical graph and the degree of the
nodes. A scatterplot for a typical instance can be found in Fig. 8 and in this case it is
found that there is a signiﬁcant correlation between the two (p < 0.01).

4 An oﬃce communication network

We can use our current model to gain insights into the underlying dynamics of a social
network. Our example here is a communication network of 33 individuals observed
over two days in a single-ﬂoor oﬃce as part of a large organisation in Australia [6]. We
deﬁne a communication tie to exist between two individuals if and only if each of the
two parties has sought information from each other more than three times over the two-
day period. This deﬁnition is to avoid brief idiosyncratic encounters that create much
noise on top of the regular communication pattern. The network is depicted in Fig.
9. The location of the nodes in the ﬁgure are the actual locations of the individual’s
cubicle or room up to a linear scaling. In particular, the dimension of the oﬃce space
is scaled so that all relevant locations ﬁts into a 1 × 1 unit square.

The network displays the generic features introduced in Section 1.2. First of all,
the density is low (ρ = 0.131). The degree distribution is (slightly) positively skewed
(skewness statistics = 0.303). The clustering coeﬃcient is high (0.389) while the median
geodesic distance is very small (2). Also, in a spatially rearranged layout of the network
in Fig. 11, one can easily identify the two distinct communities.

Indeed, one can reasonably conjecture that spatial process is important in this
communication network. To verify this, we use our current model and estimate the
model parameters, i.e. p, H, and pb (see Eq. 2). The empirical edge probability p(d)
is plotted in Fig. 10. It displays the expected big drop at the small values of d. Based
on this, we can ﬁt p(d) with a simple step function with some neighbourhood size H
such that the sum of squared errors is minimal. In this case, H is found to be 0.2. As
the overall density p is 0.131, the proximity bias pb is estimated to be 0.259, and the
correction term ∆ is estimated to be 0.0474. The large bias pb indicates that there is
a strong spatial component in the underlying social process.
4Note that one can alternatively derive the value of ∆ using Eq. 4.

5 Conclusion

In this study, we have performed Monte Carlo simulations on a class of spatial random
graph models. It has been found that the properties of these models diﬀers signiﬁcantly

from the simple Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph model.
values, the model displays simultaneously many general features of social networks
as discussed in Section 1 while the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph model fails in many
aspects.

We note that the properties of the model are similar to those of the well-known
Watts-Strogatz “small world” model [47] but that the current model has the advantage
of specifying an explicit probability distribution over the collection of all graphs with
a given number of nodes. It is also important to note that the clustering properties
of the current model arise entirely from the Poisson process describing node locations
and hence from a form of spatial baseline homophily. It is clearly an empirical question
whether such models for social networks provide an adequate descriptive account or
whether it is necessary to also incorporate inbreeding homophily eﬀects (as in exponen-
tial random graph selection models [42]) or endogenous network processes characteristic
of the Watts-Strogatz model [47] and more general exponential random graph model
speciﬁcations [8, 45, 53, 35, 19]. This is a question that has received little attention
in the network literature despite its fundamental importance to our understanding of
network evolution.

In order to identify models that provide a good match to empirical data, it will
be useful to construct a nested family of exponential random graph models that can
be used to evaluate the empirical evidence for spatial and other forms of baseline ho-

to empirical data immediately raises the possibility of at least two alternative concep-
tualisations of a spatial model: the ﬁrst, a geographical space, in which geographical
coordinates are associated with each node; and the second, a more abstract “social”
space, in which spatial proximities reﬂect baseline homophily across a broad range of
individual attributes. In each case, spatial locations may be observed or unobserved.
For the current model and the case of observed locations, it would be necessary to
estimate the model parameters p and H from the combination of location and net-
work data; in the case of unobserved locations, it would be desirable to use a version
of Hoﬀ, Handcock and Raftery’s [19] more general exponential random graph model
speciﬁcations to estimate model parameters from network data alone. More generally,
it would be desirable to construct within the exponential random graph model family,
models that also include inbreeding homophily and endogenous clustering eﬀects and
associated estimation methods.

The model described in this paper takes a useful ﬁrst step towards the construction
of such a family of models. The results presented here suggest that the ﬁt of models
to empirical data will need careful quantitative evaluation (e.g. as in [53, 45]) because
of the likely capacity of many models within the family to exhibit in broad terms the
commonly observed features of empirical social networks laid out in Section 1.2.

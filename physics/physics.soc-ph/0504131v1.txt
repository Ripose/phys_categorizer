Summary. A so called Zipf analysis portofolio management technique is introduced
in order to comprehend the risk and returns. Two portofoios are built each from a
well known ﬁnancial index. The portofolio management is based on two approaches:
one called the ”equally weighted portofolio”, the other the ”conﬁdence parametrized
portofolio”. A discussion of the (yearly) expected return, variance, Sharpe ratio and
β follows. Optimization levels of high returns or low risks are found.

1 Introduction

Risk must be expected for any reasonable investment. A portofolio should be
constructed such as to minimize the investment risk in presence of somewhat
unknown ﬂuctuation distributions of the various asset prices [1,2] in view of
obtaining the highest possible returns. The risk considered hereby is mea-
sured through the variances of returns, i.e. the β. Our previous approaches
were based on the ”time dependent” Hurst exponent [3]. In contrast, the Zipf
method which we previously developed as an investment strategy (on usual ﬁ-
nancial indices) [4,5] can be adapted to portofolio management. This is shown
here through portofolios based on the DJIA30 and the N ASDAQ100. Two
strategies are examined through diﬀerent weights to the shares in the portofo-
lio at buying or selling time. This is shown to have some interesting features.
A key parameter is the coeﬃcient of conﬁdence. Yearly expected levels of
returns are discussed through the Sharpe ratio and the risk through the β.

2 Data

Recall that a time series signal can be interpreted as a series of words of
m letters made of characters taken from an alphabet having k letters. Here

below k = 2: u and d, while the words have a systematic (constant) size
ranging between 1 and 10 letters.

Prior to some strategy deﬁnition and implementation, let us introduce a
few notations. Let the probability of ﬁnding a word of size m ending with a u
in the i (asset) series be given by Pm,i(u) ≡ Pi([ct−m+2, ct−m+1, ..., ct+1, ct; u])
and correspondingly by Pm,i(d) when a d is the last letter of a word of size
m. The character ct is that seen at the end of day t.

In the following, we have downloaded the daily closing price data available
from the web: (i) for the DJIA30, 3909 data points for the 30 available shares,
i.e. for about 16 years1; (ii) for the N ASDAQ100, 3599 data points2 for the
39 shares which have been maintained in the index, i.e. for about 14.5 years.
The ﬁrst 2500 days are taken as the preliminary historical data necessary for
calculating/setting the above probabilities at time t = 0. From these we have
invented a strategy for the following 1408 and 1098 possible investment days,
respectively, i.e. for ca. the latest 6 and 4.5 years respectively. The relevant
probabilities are recalculated at the end of each day in order to implement a
buy or sell action on the following day. The daily strategy consists in buying a
share in any index if Pm,i(u) ≥ Pm,i(d), and in selling it if Pm,i(u) ≤ Pm,i(d).
However the weight of a given stock in the portofolio of n assets can be
diﬀerent according to the preferred strategy. In the equally weighted portofolio
(EWP), each stock i has the same weight, i.e. we give wi∈B = 2/nu and
wi∈S = −1/nd, where nu (nd) is the number of shares in B (S) respectively
such that Σ[wi∈B + wi∈S] = 1, with nu + nd = n of course. This portofolio
management strategy is called ZEW P .

In the other strategy, called ZCP P , for the conﬁdence parametrized porto-
folio (CPP), the weight of a share depends on a conﬁdence parameter Km,i
≡ Pm,i(u) - Pm,i(d). The shares i to be bought on a day belong to the set B
when Km,i > 0, and those to be sold belong to the set S when Km,i < 0. The
respective weights are then taken to be wB =

, and wS =

3 Results

The yearly return, variance, Sharpe ratio, and β are given in Table 1 and Table
2 for the so called DJIA30 and so called N ASDAQ39 shares respectively as
a function of the word length m. The last line gives the corresponding results
for the DJIA30 and the N ASDAQ100 respectively. We have calculated the
average (over 5 or 4 years for the DJIA30 and N ASDAQ39 respectively)
yearly returns, i.e. E(rP ) for the portofolio P . The yearly variances σP result
from the 5 or 4 years root mean square deviations from the mean. The Sharpe
ratio SR is given by SR = E(rP ) / σP and is considered to measure the porto-
folio performance. The β is given by cov(rP , rM )/σ2
M where the P covariance

cov(rP , rM ) is measured with respect to the relevant ﬁnancial index, so called
market (M ), return. Of course, σ2
M measures the relevant market variance.
The β is considered to measure the portofolio risk. For lack of space the data
in the tables are not graphically displayed.

It is remarkable that the E(rP ) is rather low for the ZEW P , and so is the
σP , but the E(rP ) can be very large, but so is the σP in the ZCP P case for
both portofolios based on the DJIA30. The same observation can be made
for the N ASDAQ39. In the former case, the highest E(rP ) is larger than
100% (on average) and occurs for m =4, but it is the highest for m=3 in the
latter case. Yet the risk is large in such cases. The dependences of the Sharpe
ratio and β are not smooth functions of m, even indicating some systematic
dip near m = 6, in 3 cases; a peak occurs otherwise.

The expected yearly returns E(rP ) vs. σ are shown for both portofolios
and for both strategies in Figs.1-2, together with the equilibrium line, given
by E(rM )(σ/σM ), where it is understood that σ is the appropriate value for
the investigated case. Except for rare isolated points below the equilibrium
line, data points fall above it. They are even very much above in the ZCP P ’s.

vented two portofolios and maintained them for a few years, buying or selling
shares according to diﬀerent strategies. We have calculated the correspond-
ing yearly expected return, variance, Sharpe ratio and β. The best returns
and weakest risks have been determined depending on the word length. Even
though some risks can be large, returns are sometimes very high.

Abstract

We study the persistence phenomenon in a socio-econo dynamics model using computer simu-

lations at a ﬁnite temperature on hypercubic lattices in dimensions up to 5. The model includes

a ‘social’ local ﬁeld which contains the magnetization at time t. The nearest neighbour quenched

interactions are drawn from a binary distribution which is a function of the bond concentration, p.

The decay of the persistence probability in the model depends on both the spatial dimension and

p. We ﬁnd no evidence of ‘blocking’ in this model. We also discuss the implications of our results

for applications in the social and economic ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

The persistence problem is concerned with the fraction of space which persists in its initial

(t = 0) state up to some later time t. The problem has been extensively studied over the

past decade for pure spin systems at both zero [1-4] and non-zero [5] temperatures.

Typically, in the non-equilibrium dynamics of spin systems at zero-temperature, the system

is prepared initially in a random state and the fraction of spins, P (t), that persists in the

same state as at t = 0 up to some later time t is studied. For the pure ferromagnetic Ising

model on a square lattice the persistence probability has been found to decay algebraically

[1-4]

P (t) ∼ t−θ,

(1)

where θ ∼ 0.22 is the non-trivial persistence exponent [1-3].

The actual value of θ depends on both the spin [6] and spatial [3] dimensionalities; see Ray

[7] for a recent review.

At non-zero temperatures [5], consideration of the global order parameter leads to a value

of θglobal ∼ 0.5 for the pure two-dimensional Ising model.

It has been only fairly recently established that systems containing disorder [8-10] exhibit

diﬀerent persistence behaviour to that of pure systems. A key ﬁnding [8-9,11] is the appear-

ance of ‘blocking’ regardless of the amount of disorder present in the system.

As well as theoretical models, the persistence phenomenon has also been studied in a wide

range of experimental systems and the value of θ ranges from 0.19 to 1.02 [12-14], depending

on the system. A considerable amount of the recent theoretical eﬀort has gone into obtaining

the numerical value of θ for diﬀerent models.

In this work we add to the knowledge and understanding regarding persistence by presenting

the initial results for the persistence behaviour of a modiﬁed version of a recently proposed

spin model which appears to reproduce the intermittent behaviour seen in real ﬁnancial

markets [15]. In the next section we discuss the model in detail. In the subsequent section

we give an outline of the method used and the values of the various parameters employed.

Section IV describes the results and the consequent implications for using the models in a

ﬁnancial or social context. Finally, in Section V there is brief conclusion.

II. THE MODIFIED BORNHOLDT MODEL

The simulations were performed on a modiﬁed version of a spin model of ﬁnancial markets

proposed recently by Bornholdt [15].

In the original Bornholdt model, N market traders, denoted by Ising spins Si(t), i =

1 . . . N, are located on the sites of a hypercubic lattice. The action of the ith trader of

buying or selling at time step t corresponds to the spin variable Si(t) assuming the value +1

or −1, respectively. A local ﬁeld, hi(t), determines the dynamics of the spins. In particular,

hi(t) =

JijSj(t) − αCi(t)

Sj(t),

N

j=1

where the ﬁrst summation runs over the nearest neighbours of i only (Jij = J, for nearest

neighbours and Jij = 0, otherwise), α > 0 couples to the magnetization, and Ci(t) is a

second spin used to represent the strategy of agent i.

Subsequently, Yamano [16] worked with a model where the local ﬁeld is given by

hi(t) =

JijSj(t) − α |

Sj(t) | .

(2)

Although here the strategy spin is omitted, the coupling constant is retained. Furthermore,

the nearest neighbour interactions are now selected randomly, Jij = ±J. Each agent is

updated according to the following heat bath dynamics:

Si(t+1) =

+1



with q = [1 + exp(−2βhi(t))]−1,

with 1 − q,

(3)

where q is the probability of updating and β is the inverse temperature.

In this model

the return is deﬁned in terms of the logarithm of the absolute value of the magnetization,

M(t) =

N
j=1 Sj(t)/N, that is

P

Return (t) = ln | M(t) | −ln | M(t − 1) |

(4)

Simulations [16] in spatial dimensions ranging from d = 1 to d = 5 indicate that the

modiﬁed version of the model reproduces the required intermittent behaviour in the returns

for suitable values of the coupling constant and the temperature T ; these are listed in Table

Intermittent behaviour was observed in the returns when the

temperature was set at Tint as given above.

In this work we investigate the persistence behaviour of the model where the local ﬁeld is

given by equation (2) but the nearest neighbour interactions are selected from

P (Jij) = (1 − p)δ(Jij + 1) + pδ(Jij − 1),

(5)

. where p is the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds. Hence, we are interested in deter-

mining the fraction of traders who have been at time t either buying or selling continuously

since t = 0. We will also suggest a possible interpretation within sociophysics of the model

later on.

III. METHODOLOGY

As mentioned in the previous section, for each spatial dimension d we ﬁrst ﬁne tune the

temperature to reproduce intermittent behaviour in the returns. As can be seen from Table 1,

the temperature Tint(d) decreases with d. For a given dimension, all subsequent simulations

are performed at that temperature. Averages over at least 100 samples for each run were

performed and the error-bars in the following plots are smaller than the data points.

The value of each agent at t = 0 is noted and the dynamics updated according to equation

Initially, ni(0) = 1 for all i. It changes to zero when an agent changes from buying to selling

or vice vera for the ﬁrst time. Note that once ni(t) = 0, it remains so for all subsequent

where N = Ld is the total number of agents present.

P (t) = n(t)/N,

IV. RESULTS

We now discuss our results. In ﬁgure 1 we show a semi-log plot of the persistence probability

against time t for a range of bond concentrations 0 < p ≤ 0.5 for d = 1. It’s clear from the

plot that the data can be ﬁtted to

P (t) ∼ e−γt,

where we estimate γ ∼ 0.56 from the linear ﬁt.

Figure 2 displays the results for d = 2. Although once again there is evidence for exponential

decay, this time it would appear that the value of the parameter γ depends on the p. For

p = 0.1 we estimate γ ∼ 0.35. The results for the three-dimensional case are shown in

ﬁgure 3. Here we see clear evidence of the qualitative nature of the decay depending on the

bond concentration. For p = 0.5 we have behaviour very similar to the two cases considered

earlier, namely exponential decay. However, the decay is clearly non-exponential for p = 0.1.

The results in d = 4 are very similar to those for d = 3 and we will not present them here.

Instead, in ﬁgure 4 we show a log-log plot of the persistence against time for d = 5. The

decay of P (t) is seen to be heavily dependent on the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds.

For low values of p(≤ 0.3), we have a power-law decay at long times as given by equation

(1) with an estimated value of θ ∼ 0.5. For higher value of p the decay would appear not to

be a power-law but also not exponential in it’s nature.

p = 0.5 is very similar to that found in lower dimensions. The behaviour for p = 0.1 is clearly

non-exponential.

V. CONCLUSION

To conclude, we have presented the results of extensive simulations for the persistence be-

haviour of agents in a model capturing some of the features found in real ﬁnancial markets.

Although the model contains bond disorder, we do not ﬁnd any evidence of ‘blocking’ .

The persistence behaviour appears to depend on both the spatial dimensionality and the

concentration of ferromagnetic bonds. Generally, whereas in low dimensions the decay is

exponential, for higher dimensions and low values of p we get power-law behaviour.

The initial model was developed in an economic context. Power law persistence in the case

means the existence of traders who keep on buying or selling for long durations. Furthermore,

the presence of ‘blocking’ would be highly unrealistic for modelling the dynamics because

the traders would have access to a ﬁnite amount of capital.

One can also interpret the model in a social context. Here the value Si(t) = +1 or

−1 could represent an opinion. Here ‘blocking’ would be realistic and correspond to the

decay in the persistence probability would probably be an unrealistic model.

Hence, we can use the behaviour of the persistence probability a criterion to decide

whether we have a realistic economic or social model.

Recent developments on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) [1, 2], have raised the

proﬁle of the market operating mechanism, the “market structure”, employed by a stock

market. The two major stock markets in the U.S., the NYSE and the National Association

of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) National Market have very

different structures [3, 4], and there is continuing controversy over whether reported dif-

ferences in stock price behaviour are due to differences in market structure or company

characteristics [5]. As the inﬂuence of market structure on stock prices may be obscured

by exogenous factors such as demand and supply [6, 7], we hypothesize that modulation of

the ﬂow of transactions due to market operations may carry a stronger imprint of the in-

ternal market mechanism. To this end, we analyse times between consecutive transactions

for a diverse group of stocks registered on the NYSE and NASDAQ markets, and we re-

late the dynamical properties of the intertrade times with those of the corresponding price

ﬂuctuations. We report evidence of a robust scale-invariant temporal organisation in the

transaction timing of stocks which is independent of individual company characteristics and

industry sector, but which depends on market structure. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that stocks

registered on the NASDAQ exhibit signiﬁcantly stronger correlations in their transaction

timing within a trading day, compared with NYSE stocks. Further, we ﬁnd that companies

that transfer from the NASDAQ to the NYSE show a reduction in the correlation strength

of transaction timing within a trading day, after the move, suggesting inﬂuences of market

structure. Surprisingly, we also observe that stronger power-law correlations in intertrade

times are coupled with stronger power-law correlations in absolute price returns and higher

price volatility, suggesting a strong link between the dynamical properties of intertrade times

and the corresponding price ﬂuctuations over a broad range of time scales. Comparing the

1

NYSE and NASDAQ markets, we demonstrate that the higher correlations we ﬁnd in inter-

trade times for NASDAQ stocks are indeed matched by higher correlations in absolute price

returns and by higher volatility, suggesting that market structure may affect price behaviour

through information contained in transaction timing. These ﬁndings may have implications

for the use of transaction timing in the prediction of prices and risk management on different

stock markets.

The impact of market structure and associated rules of operation on market efﬁciency and stock

price formation have attracted considerable public attention in recent months [1]. This has also

been of concern to those involved in stock market regulation, on behalf of investors [1, 8], since

optimising market structure results in more effectively functioning markets [9] and increases a

market’s competitiveness for market share in listed stocks [10]. Recent comparative studies of

the NYSE and NASDAQ markets have primarily focused on stock prices to provide evidence

that market organisational structure affects the price formation process [9, 11, 12]. Speciﬁcally,

it has been shown that stocks registered on the NASDAQ may be characterised by a larger bid-

ask spread [13] and higher price volatility [9, 11, 12]. However, this is often attributed to the

market capitalisation, growth rate or the nature of the companies listed on the NASDAQ [5].

Furthermore, empirical studies have emphasized the dominant role and impact of trading volume

on prices [6, 7]; since traded volume is determined by investors it is difﬁcult to isolate the effects

of market structure on price formation.

To better understand the mechanism by which market structure may affect stock prices, we

study the information contained in the times between consecutive stock transactions. As market-

speciﬁc operations may modulate the ﬂow of transactions, we hypothesize that dynamical features

of transaction timing reﬂect the underlying market mechanism. Speciﬁcally, we ask if stocks of

companies with diverse characteristics registered on a given market exhibit common features in

their transaction timing, which may be associated with the particular market structure. Further,

we investigate how the dynamical properties of transaction timing relate to dynamical features of

price ﬂuctuations over a range of time scales, and whether market structure affects the temporal

organisation of price ﬂuctuations.

To probe how market structure inﬂuences the trading of stocks, we consider the two major U.S.

stock markets, the NYSE and the NASDAQ. All transactions on the NYSE of a given stock are

centralised and are controlled by a single human operator called a “specialist”, whose primary role

is to match together public buy and sell orders on the basis of price, in an auction-like setting [3].

2

The NYSE specialist is under obligation to maintain both price continuity and a “fair and orderly

market” [3]. The specialist is also under obligation to intervene, using his own ﬁrm’s inventory of

available stock, to provide liquidity in the event of an order imbalance, preventing sharp changes in

the stock price [3]. The NYSE regulations allow for considerable ﬂexibility within the specialist’s

operations [2].

In contrast, trading on the NASDAQ is decentralised, with trading in a given

stock managed by a number of dealers called “market makers”. Each market maker maintains

his own inventory of stock in order to buy and sell to the public [4]. In comparison, the NYSE

specialist rarely uses his own ﬁrm’s inventory: such transactions involve less than 15% of trading

volume [14]. Although several regional exchanges may trade NYSE listed stocks, price formation

has primarily been attributed to NYSE trading [15]. In contrast, the NASDAQ market relies on

competition between multiple dealers for public orders to facilitate the price formation process

[13]. Moreoever, a substantial fraction of share volume on the NASDAQ is not handled by dealers,

but is traded electronically via networks for small public orders and for institutional investors [4].

Such fragmentation of the NASDAQ stock market has been associated with higher price volatility

[9].

Here we ask to what extent such structural and operational differences between the NYSE and

NASDAQ markets affect the ﬂow of transactions. It is difﬁcult to answer whether differences in

intertrade times are due to individual company characteristics because the majority of empirical

studies have considered a single stock over a few months [16, 17]. Studies which considered the

intertrade times of a larger group of stocks did not ﬁnd common features in the intertrade times

and did not compare between markets [18, 19]. The only comparative study considered a single

NYSE and a single Paris stock, ﬁnding some differences in their intertrade times, but those may

well be due to a different culture of trading [20]. To probe for evidence of the impact of market

structure on the trading of stocks, we employ concepts and methods from statistical physics to

investigate the correlation properties of transaction timing for diverse companies, over time scales

ranging from seconds up to a year.

We examine one hundred stocks listed on the NYSE, from eleven industry sectors: Technology-

Hardware(5), Semiconductors(2), Pharmaceutical & Medical Equipment(10), Financial(8), Auto-

motive(9), Defense/Aerospace(9), Mining, Metals & Steel Works(8), Chemicals & Plastics(7),

Retail & Food(17), Petroleum, Gas & Heavy Machinery(10), Telephone Service Providers(7),

Electric & Power Services(8). We study the time intervals between successive stock trades, over a

period of four years - 4 Jan. 1993 to 31 Dec. 1996 - as recorded in the Trades and Quotes (TAQ)

3

database from the NYSE (Table I). We also analyse one hundred NASDAQ stocks from four-

teen industry sectors: Technology-Hardware(28), Technology-Software(16), Semiconductors(7),

Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology & Medical Equipment(12), Financial(5), Automotive(1), Steel

Works(1), Chemicals(1), Retail & Food(16), Petroleum, Gas & Heavy Machinery (2), Telephone

& Cable Television Service Providers(5), Services(2), Transportation(3), Electrical Apparatus(1).

We study the time intervals between successive stock trades as recorded in the TAQ database, for

twenty-nine companies over the period 4 Jan. 1993 - 31 Dec. 1996, and seventy one companies

over the period 3 Jan. 1994 - 30 Nov. 1995 (marked with (*) in Table II). For both markets,

we select companies with average market capitalisations ranging over three decades, and varying

levels of trading activity with average values of intertrade time between 11 and 640 seconds for

NYSE stocks, and between 5 and 680 seconds for NASDAQ stocks. In parallel with the intertrade

times, we analyse the prices for both sets of stocks over the same periods.

Like many ﬁnancial time series the intertrade times (ITT) are inhomogeneous and nonstation-

ary, with statistical properties changing with time, e.g. ITT data exhibit trends superposed on a

pattern of daily activity. While ITT ﬂuctuate in an irregular and complex manner on a trade-by-

trade basis, empirical observations reveal that periods of inactive trading are often followed by

periods of more active trading (Fig. 1). Such patterns can be seen at scales of observation ranging

from minutes to months, suggesting that there may be a self-similar, fractal structure in the tempo-

ral organisation of intertrade times, independent of the average level of trading activity of a given

stock.

To probe for scale-invariant features in the ﬂuctuations of intertrade times, we apply the de-

trended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) method, which has been shown to detect and accurately quan-

tify long-range power-law correlations embedded in noisy non-stationary time series with polyno-

mial trends [21]. We choose this method because traditional techniques such as power spectral,

autocorrelation and Hurst analyses are not suited to nonstationary data [22]. The DFA method

(DFA-l) quantiﬁes the root-mean-square ﬂuctuations F (n) of a signal at different time scales n,

after accounting for nonstationarity in the data by subtracting underlying polynomial trends of or-
der (l − 1). A power-law functional form F (n) ∼ nα indicates self-similarity and fractal scaling

in the ITT time series. The scaling exponent α quantiﬁes the strength of correlations in the ITT

ﬂuctuations: if α = 0.5 there are no correlations, and the signal is uncorrelated random noise; if

α < 0.5 the signal is anti-correlated, meaning that large values are more likely to be followed by

small values; if α > 0.5 there are positive correlations and the signal exhibits persistent behaviour,

4

where large values are more likely to be followed by large values and small values by small val-

ues. The higher the value of α, the stronger the correlations. The DFA method avoids the spurious

detection of apparent long-range correlations that are an artifact of polynomial trends and other

types of nonstationarities [22, 23, 24].

We ﬁnd that the ITT series for all stocks on both markets exhibit long-range power-law corre-

lations over a broad range of time scales, from several trades to hundreds of thousands of trades,

characterised by a scaling exponent α > 0.5 (Fig. 2). For all stocks on both markets we observe

a crossover in the scaling curve F (n) from a scaling regime with a lower exponent α1 over time

scales less than a trading day, to a scaling regime with an exponent α2 > α1 (stronger positive

correlations) over time scales from days to almost a year.

Further, we ﬁnd that this crossover is systematically more pronounced for NYSE stocks com-

pared with NASDAQ stocks. Characterising ITT ﬂuctuations over time scales less than a day,

we ﬁnd that NASDAQ stocks exhibit systematically stronger correlations than NYSE stocks, with
= 0.75 ± 0.04 (group
= 0.62 ± 0.03 (Fig. 2). In contrast, over time

horizons above a trading day, we ﬁnd that the correlation properties of ITT on both markets are

= 0.87 ± 0.09 (Fig. 2).

We next investigate how the correlation properties of ITT depend on the average level of trading

activity, and if this dependence differs with market structure. Since both sets of a hundred stocks

that we study on the NYSE and NASDAQ markets encompass a wide range of average trading

activity, we split both sets into six subsets with matching average ITT (IT T ) and approximately

equal numbers of stocks (Fig. 2b,c). Within each market we ﬁnd that over time scales less than a

day, the correlation exponent characterising the trading dynamics is larger for stocks with higher

trading activity (lower IT T ) (Fig. 3a). Surprisingly, this dependence persists over much longer

time scales, ranging from days to months (Fig. 3b). For NYSE stocks we ﬁnd a logarithmic
dependence of αIT T

on IT T . We then compare the scaling behaviour of ITT for each

and αIT T

1

2

subset of NASDAQ stocks with the subset of NYSE stocks with matching IT T . We ﬁnd that the
average correlation exponent αIT T

for the NASDAQ stocks is consistently higher compared with
IT TNASDAQ
the NYSE stocks for each subset, and that the difference α
1

− αIT TNY SE
1

is practically

1

independent of IT T (Fig. 3a). In contrast, there is no systematic difference in the values of the
average αIT T

for NASDAQ and NYSE stocks for subsets with matching IT T (Fig. 3b). These

2

5

observations suggest that the difference in the correlation properties of intertrade times of NYSE

and NASDAQ stocks is independent of the average level of trading activity.

Since for both NYSE and NASDAQ stocks we have chosen a range of market capitalisations,

industry sectors and average levels of trading activity, our ﬁndings of a crossover in the scaling

behaviour of ITT and stronger correlations over intraday time scales for NASDAQ stocks, support

our hypothesis that market structure affects the dynamics of transaction timing. However, more

established companies listed on the NYSE may be subject to different trading patterns when com-

pared with the younger and more rapidly growing companies on the NASDAQ. To verify that the

stronger correlations in ITT over time scales less than a day for NASDAQ stocks are indeed due to

market structure, we ask if the scaling properties of ITT systematically change for companies that

transfer from the NASDAQ to the NYSE. In particular, we investigate the trading dynamics of ten

companies that moved from the NASDAQ to the NYSE around the end of 1994 and the beginning

of 1995 (Table III). For each company, we analyse the ITT time series while the company was on

the NASDAQ and then repeat the analysis when the company was on the NYSE.

For all ten companies we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant change in the scaling properties of intertrade times:
a marked decrease in the strength of the power-law correlations within a trading day (lower αIT T

)

1

associated with the transfer from the NASDAQ to the NYSE (Fig. 4). There is however, no cor-

responding systematic change in the correlations over time scales above a trading day, consistent
with our ﬁndings of statistically similar values of scaling exponent αIT T

for the two groups of

2

one hundred stocks registered on the NYSE and NASDAQ (Fig. 2). Thus, our results indicate that

market structure impacts not only trading dynamics on a trade-by-trade basis [19], but also the

fractal temporal organisation of trades over time scales up to a day. The presence of stronger in-

traday correlations in transaction timing for NASDAQ stocks may be attributed to the multiplicity

of dealers (ranging from 2 to 50 per stock during 1994 [13]) and electronic methods of trading

(Electronic Communication Networks and the Small Order Execution System [4]), allowing the

NASDAQ to efﬁciently absorb ﬂuctuations in trading activity in almost real time [10]. In contrast,

for each stock on the NYSE, while there is the electronic SuperDOT routing system, each order

has to be exposed to and compared with outstanding orders, as the single NYSE specialist ﬁnds

the best bid to match an offer with [3]. This may lead to interruptions in the execution of a rapid

succession of trades on the NYSE, resulting in weaker correlations in intertrade times within a

trading day.

On the other hand, our ﬁnding of stronger power-law correlations for both markets over time

6

horizons from a trading day to several months (αIT T

2 > αIT T

1

) suggests that investors’ behaviour

is more coherent over longer time scales, as information driving trading activity takes time to
disseminate. Moreover, this can account for the similar values of αIT T

for subsets of NYSE

2

and NASDAQ stocks with matched IT T , since news and information driving trading activity are

exogenous to market structure.

Finally, we investigate if the market-mediated differences in long-range power-law correlations

in ITT translate into differences in the scaling behaviour of price ﬂuctuations of stocks registered

on the NASDAQ and NYSE markets. To this end, in parallel with ITT we analyse the absolute

price returns for each company in our database for both markets. For all stocks we observe a

crossover at a trading day in the scaling function F (n) of price ﬂuctuations [25], from weaker

to stronger correlations, corresponding to the crossover we observe for intertrade times. In addi-

tion we ﬁnd that over time scales less than a day, stocks with stronger correlations in ITT exhibit

stronger correlations in absolute price returns. In particular, we ﬁnd that the stronger correlations

in ITT associated with the NASDAQ market structure (α

nied by stronger correlations in price ﬂuctuations (α|RET |NASDAQ

1

> αIT TNY SE
1

), are accompa-

> α|RET |NY SE

1

) over time scales

within a trading day (Fig. 5a). We also ﬁnd evidence of a positive relationship between correla-

tions in ITT and correlations in price ﬂuctuations over time scales larger than a trading day for

NASDAQ stocks. In contrast, there is no corresponding positive relationship for NYSE stocks,

suggesting a weaker coupling between trading dynamics and price formation under the NYSE

market structure, over time horizons above a trading day. While previous work has suggested that

bursts of trading activity have an instantaneous impact on stock prices [19, 26], our results show

that the interaction between trading times and price formation may be more complex, where fractal

temporal patterns in ITT are linked with scaling features of price ﬂuctuations over a broad range

of time scales.

We then test whether long-range correlations in ITT may be linked with stock price volatility.

Previous studies have reported higher price volatility for NASDAQ stocks compared with NYSE

stocks [9, 11, 12]. We ﬁnd a positive relationship, with stronger correlations in ITT over time
scales less than a day related to higher daily volatility σRET , and that the NASDAQ stocks have
higher αIT T
and correspondingly higher σRET compared with NYSE stocks (Fig. 5b). This re-
lationship may appear to follow from our observation that αIT T

depends on IT T (Fig. 3a), and

1

1

previous studies which connect price volatility with periods of high transaction rates [16]. How-
ever, for the stocks in our database (Tables I & II), we ﬁnd no clear dependence between σRET

7

and average level of trading activity as measured by IT T (Fig. 5c). Thus the relationship between
and σRET suggests that information contained in the microscopic temporal structure of ITT
αIT T
1

is carried over a range of scales to impact daily price volatility.

In summary, our results indicate that market structure inﬂuences the correlation properties of

transaction timing, with stocks registered on the NASDAQ showing systematically stronger long-

range, power-law correlations within a trading day compared with stocks listed on the NYSE.

Moreover, stocks characterised by stronger correlations in their intertrade times exhibit stronger

correlations in their price ﬂuctuations and higher daily price volatility. Further, stocks registered

on the NASDAQ are characterised not only by higher volatility compared with NYSE stocks,

but also by stronger correlations in price ﬂuctuations over time scales less than a day, suggesting

an inﬂuence of market structure on the process of price formation over a range of time scales.

Understanding the scale-invariant properties of intertrade times is crucial to the development of

more realistic models of the price formation process [16, 18, 27, 28, 29] and its dependence

on market structure. Furthermore, these results are of interest in the context of the continuing

process of optimising market structure to maintain the efﬁciency and competitiveness of U. S.

stock markets.

Figure 1: Relationship between stock price and trading activity. Representative example of time

series derived from the Trades and Quotes (TAQ) database for transactions of stock in Compaq

Computer Corp. (CPQ) registered on the NYSE. (a) Price of CPQ stock over a three week period

from 20 Feb.- 8 Mar. 1996 (42606 trades). On 1 Mar. 1996 Compaq reported that it would cut

product prices in order to meet sales targets, leading to a drop in the stock price. (b) Intertrade

times (ITT) of CPQ stock over the same period. Data exhibit complex ﬂuctuations, a daily pattern

of trading activity (with short ITT at the open and close of a trading day and longer ITT in

between), and highly heterogeneous structure, as seen in the ﬂurry of trades following the price

drop. The relaxation time of the ITT response following the price drop extends over several days,

suggesting that information may be contained in the temporal structure of trading activity. Data

include transactions occurring between 9.30am and 4pm EST, excluding weekends and holidays.

Figure 2: Different correlation properties in intertrade times for stocks registered on the NYSE

and NASDAQ markets. (a) Root-mean-square ﬂuctuation function F (n) obtained using DFA-2

analysis, for the intertrade times (ITT) of stock in NASDAQ company Sun Microsystems

(SUNW) and NYSE company Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ). Here n indicates the time scale

in number of trades. We normalize the time scale n by the daily average number of trades for

each stock, so that a unit normalized scale indicates one trading day (marked by a dashed line).

The scaling curves are vertically offset for clarity. While both companies have similar market

capitalisations, industry sectors and average levels of trading activity (average ITT) and exhibit

long-range power-law correlations over a broad range of scales, the scaling behaviour of the

intertrade times for the two stocks is quite different. For CPQ we ﬁnd a pronounced crossover

from weaker correlations over time scales smaller than a day, to stronger correlations over time

scales larger than a trading day (α

). In contrast, the scaling function F (n) for

SUNW does not exhibit such a crossover, and we ﬁnd much stronger correlations over time scales
smaller than a trading day compared with CPQ (αIT TSU NW

one hundred NASDAQ stocks, of companies with a broad range of market capitalisations and

industry sectors. Stocks are ranked in order of decreasing average value of ITT (IT T ) (as in

1

Tables I & II), and are split into subsets (marked by vertical dashed lines) with matching IT T
and approximately equal numbers of stocks. We estimate αIT T
over scales from 8 trades to half
of the daily average number of trades (for stocks with fewer than 1.5 × 105 trades/year), and to
a third of the daily average number of trades (for stocks with more than 1.5 × 105 trades/year).
We estimate αIT T
averages and standard deviations of αIT T
market. Systematically higher values of αIT T
for the NASDAQ stocks (statistically signiﬁcant
difference with p-value p < 10−7 by the Student’s t-test) suggest an underlying inﬂuence of

, characterising correlation properties of intertrade times over scales above a trading day

(p = 0.03 by the Student’s t-test). We ﬁnd similar results when we analyse trading activity at high

resolution in terms of the number of trades per minute: a crossover at one trading day and stronger

correlations for NASDAQ stocks compared with NYSE stocks over time scales less than a day

(features which were not observed in previous studies [30, 31]). We further observe an increasing
trend in the values of αIT T

characterising the strength of correlations in ITT over scales from seconds up to a trading day, on

the average level of trading activity. Each datapoint represents the group average over a subset of

stocks, with a matching range of average intertrade times IT T for the two markets. Stocks are

grouped into subsets as indicated by vertical dashed lines in Fig. 2b,c. The consistent difference
in the scaling exponent αIT T

between NYSE and NASDAQ stocks suggests that independent

1

of company characteristics such as market capitalisation and industry sector,

the temporal

organisation of ITT within a trading day carries an imprint of market structure. (b) Dependence
of exponent αIT T

characterising correlations in ITT over time scales from a trading day to several

2

months, on the average level of trading activity. On both markets we observe similar behaviour
with no systematic difference in the values of αIT T

between NYSE and NASDAQ subsets of

2

stocks with matching ranges of IT T . These results suggest that over time horizons longer than

17

a trading day, the impact of market structure on trading dynamics is less pronounced as more

information is available to investors over longer time scales, driving their trading activity. The
2 > αIT T
resulting more coherent behaviour of investors is reﬂected in stronger correlations (αIT T

)

over longer time scales.

Figure 4: Correlation properties of intertrade times of companies that moved from the NASDAQ

to the NYSE during 1994-1995. (a) Fluctuation function F (n), obtained using DFA-2 analysis on

ITT of stock in the company Mid-Atlantic Medical Services Inc. while it was on the NASDAQ

(3 January 1994 - 29 September 1994) and then after it moved to the NYSE (30 September 1994

- 30 November 1995). Here n indicates the scale in number of trades and the vertical dashed

lines indicate the average daily number of trades while on the NYSE or the NASDAQ. The two

scaling curves are vertically offset for clarity. After the move to the NYSE there is a decrease

in the correlation exponent at time scales within a trading day and a pronounced crossover to

stronger correlations with a higher exponent at larger time scales.

companies that moved from the NASDAQ to the NYSE. Companies are ranked in order of
decreasing IT T while on the NYSE (as in Table III) and the scaling range for αIT T

is the same

as for the hundred NYSE and NASDAQ stocks (Fig. 2b,c). For all companies there is a decrease
in αIT T
1

after the move to the NYSE, indicating that the transition to weaker correlations in ITT

over time scales less than a day is due to the NYSE market structure and not to company-speciﬁc

characteristics.

We calculate price returns over 1-minute intervals and α|RET |
utes (≈ half a trading day, which is 390 minutes). The positive relationship between αIT T
α|RET |

indicates that stronger correlations in ITT are coupled with stronger correlations in price

over time scales from 8 to 180 min-

and

ﬂuctuations. This ﬁnding suggests that price ﬂuctuations are not merely a response to short-term

18

bursts of trading activity [16, 26]: rather the fractal organisation of price ﬂuctuations over a broad

range of time scales is linked to the observed underlying scaling features in the series of intertrade
times. Dependence of stock price volatility σRET on (b) the correlation exponent αIT T
and (c) the
average value of ITT for the same stocks as in (a). We calculate σRET as the standard deviation

1

of daily logarithmic price returns over six-month periods, averaging over all six-month periods

throughout the entire record of each stock. Our results show no strong dependence between stock
price volatility σRET and average level of trading activity, rather the volatility appears sensitive to

the strength of the temporal correlations in ITT. These ﬁndings suggest that scale-invariant features

in transaction times may play an important role in price formation. Furthermore, both dynamic

and static properties of stock prices appear to be inﬂuenced by market-speciﬁc features in transac-
tion timing: stronger power-law correlations in ITT (higher values of αIT T
are matched by stronger power-law correlations in price ﬂuctuations (higher values of α|RET |
higher volatility (σRET ), compared with NYSE stocks.

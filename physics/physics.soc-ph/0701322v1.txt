Abstract

We consider the coupled dynamics of the adaption of network structure and the
evolution of strategies played by individuals occupying the network vertices. We
propose a computational model in which each agent plays a n-round Prisoner’s
Dilemma game with its immediate neighbors, after that, based upon self-interest,
partial individuals may punish their defective neighbors by dismissing the social
tie to the one who defects the most times, meanwhile seek for a new partner at
random from the neighbors of the punished agent. It is found that the promotion
of cooperation is attributed to the entangled evolution of individual strategy and
network structure. Moreover, we show that the emerging social networks exhibit high
heterogeneity and disassortative mixing pattern. For a given average connectivity
of the population and the number of rounds, there is a critical value for the fraction
of individuals adapting their social interactions, above which cooperators wipe out
defectors. Besides, the eﬀects of the average degree, the number of rounds, and
the intensity of selection are investigated by extensive numerical simulations. Our
results to some extent reﬂect the underlying mechanism promoting cooperation.

1 Introduction

Cooperative behaviors are ubiquitous in real world, ranging from biological
systems to socioeconomic systems. However, the question of how natural selec-
tion can lead to cooperation has fascinated evolutionary biologists for several
decades. Fortunately, together with classic game theory, evolutionary game
theory provides a systematic and convenient framework for understanding
the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behaviors among selﬁsh in-
dividuals [1,2]. Especially, the Prisoner’s Dilemma game (PDG) as a general
metaphor for studying the evolution of cooperation has attracted considerable
interests [3].

In the original PDG, two players simultaneously decide whether to cooperate
(C) or to defect (D). They both receive R upon mutual cooperation and P
upon mutual defection. A defector exploiting a C player gets T , and the ex-
ploited cooperator receives S, such that T > R > P > S and 2R > T + S.
As a result, it is best to defect regardless of the co-player’s decision. Thus,
in well-mixed inﬁnite populations, defection is the evolutionarily stable strat-
egy (ESS), even though all individuals would be better oﬀ if they cooperated.
Thereby this creates the social dilemma, because when everybody defects, the
mean population payoﬀ is lower than that when everybody cooperates. In
a recent review Nowak suggested ﬁve rules for the evolution of cooperation
(see Ref. [4] and references therein). Most noteworthy, departure from the
well-mixed population scenario, the rule “network reciprocity” conditions the
emergence of cooperation among players occupying the network vertices [5].
That is, the beneﬁt-to-cost ratio must exceed the average number of neighbors
per individual. Actually, the successful development of network science pro-
vides a convenient framework to describe the population structure on which
the evolution of cooperation is studied. The vertices represent players, while
the edges denote links between players in terms of game dynamical inter-
actions. Furthermore, interactions in real-world network of contacts are het-
erogeneous, often associated with scale-free (power-law) dependence on the
degree distribution, P (k) ∼ k−γ with 2 < γ < 3. Accordingly, the evolution of
cooperation on model networks with features such as lattices [6,7,8,9], small-
world [10,11,12], scale-free [13,14,15], and community structure [16] has been
scrutinized. Interestingly, Santos et al. found that scale-free networks provide
a unifying framework for the emergency of cooperation [13].

From the best of our knowledge, so far much previous works of games on net-
works are based on crystalized (static) networks, i.e. the social networks on
which the evolution of cooperation is studied are ﬁxed from the outset and not
aﬀected by evolutionary dynamics on top of them. However, interaction net-
works in real world are continuously evolving ones, rather than static graphs.
Indeed, individuals have adaptations on the number, frequency, and duration

2

of their social ties base upon some certain feedback mechanisms. Instead of
investigating the evolutionary games on static networks which constitute just
one snapshot of the real evolving ones, recently, some researchers proposed
that the network structure may co-evolve with the evolutionary game dy-
namics [17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Interestingly, as pointed out in Refs. [18,19,22],
the entangled evolution of individual strategy and network structure consti-
tutes a key mechanism for the sustainability of cooperation in social networks.
Therefore, to understand the emergence of cooperative behavior in realistic
situations (networks), one should combine strategy evolution with topological
evolution. From this perspective, we propose a computational model in which
both the adaptation of underlying network of interactions and the evolution of
behavioral strategy are taken into account simultaneously. In our model, each
agent plays a n-round Prisoner’s Dilemma game with its immediate neigh-
bors, after that, based upon self-interest, partial individuals may punish their
defective neighbors by dismissing the social tie to the one who defects the
most times, meanwhile seek for a new partner at random from the neighbors
of the punished agent. We shall show that such individual’s local adaptive
interactions lead to the situation where cooperators become evolutionarily
competitive due to the preference of assortative mixing between cooperators.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the following section,
the model is introduced in detail. Sec. III presents the simulation results and
discussions. We ﬁnally draw conclusions in Sec. IV.

2 The model

We consider a symmetric two-player game where N individuals engage in the
Prisoner’s Dilemma game (PDG) over a network. The total number of edges
M is ﬁxed during the evolutionary process. Each individual i plays with its
immediate neighbors deﬁned by the underlying network. The neighbor set of
individual i is denoted as Ωi, which is allowed to evolve according to the game
results. Let us denote by si the strategy of individual i. Player i can follow two
simple strategies: cooperation [C, si = (1, 0)T ] and defection [D, si = (0, 1)T ]
in each round. Following previous studies [24,25], the payoﬀ matrix M has a
rescaled form depending on a single parameter,

M =



1 0






b 0




,

(1)

where 1 < b < 2.
In each round, each agent plays the same strategy with all its neighbors, and
accumulates the payoﬀ, observing the aggregate payoﬀ and strategy of its

3

(2)

(3)

neighbors. The total income of the player at the site x can be expressed as

Px = X
y∈Ωx

sT
x Msy,

where the sum runs over all the neighboring sites of x, Ωx. In evolutionary
games the players are allowed to adopt the strategies of their neighbors after
each round. Then, the individual x randomly selects a neighbor y for possi-
bly updating its strategy. The site x will adopt y’s strategy with probability
determined by the total payoﬀ diﬀerence between them [6,26,27]:

Wsx←sy =

1
1 + exp[β(Px − Py)]

,

where the parameter β is an inverse temperature in statistical physics, the
value of which characterizes the intensity of selection. β → 0 leads to neutral
(random) drift whereas β → ∞ corresponds to the imitation dynamics where
the y’s strategy replaces x’s whenever Py > Px. For ﬁnite value of β, the larger
β is, the ﬁtter strategy is more apt to replace to the less one, thus the value
of β indicates the intensity of selection.

In the present model, we assume each agent plays a n-round PDG with its
neighbors (n ≥ 1), and then m randomly selected individuals are allowed to
adapt their social ties according to the game results (1 ≤ m ≤ N). Here
the individuals are endowed with the limited cognitive capacities—each agent
records the strategies of its opponents used in the n-round game. Then they
are able to decide to maintain those ties from which they beneﬁt from, and
to rewire the adverse links. For the sake of simplicity, if someone is picked
for updating its neighbors, only the most disadvantageous edge is rewired. It
dismisses the link to the one, who defects the most times (if there exist more
than one individuals who defect the same maximum times, the one is chosen
at random), and redirects the link to a random neighbor of the punished (see
Fig. 1 as an illustrative example). The advantage of rewiring to neighbor’s
neighbor is twofold: ﬁrst, individuals tend to interact with others that are
close by in a social manner [28], i.e. friend’s friend is more likely to become a
friend (partner); second, every agent is seeking to attach to cooperators, thus
redirecting to neighbor’s neighbor will be a good choice since the neighbor
also tries to establish links with cooperators. Hence rewiring to a neighbor of
a defector is no doubt a good choice for individuals with local information
only [22]. Herein, the parameters n and m can be viewed as the correspond-
ing time scales of strategy evolution and network structure adaptation. As
our strategy evolution uses synchronous updating, while evolution of network
topology adopts asynchronous updating, in our case, the strategy updating
event proceeds naturally much more frequent than evolution of network struc-
ture (as N · n > m). Nevertheless, even though network structure adaption is

much lower than game dynamics, cooperation is still promoted by the eﬃcient
interplay between the two dynamics.

Let us point out the diﬀerences between our model and previous works. In
Refs. [18,19], the evolution of strategy adopted the “Best-Take-Over” update
rule where each agent imitates the strategy of the best neighbor. Besides,
individuals are divided into two types based on the payoﬀs: satisﬁed and un-
satisﬁed. If individual’s payoﬀ is the highest among its neighbors, then it is
satisﬁed. Otherwise, it is unsatisﬁed. The network adaptation dynamics is re-
stricted to the ones who are defectors and unsatisﬁed. Thus the unsatisﬁed
defector breaks the link with defective neighbor with probability p, replaces
it by randomly choosing agent uniformly from the network. More recently,
Ref. [22] proposed another minimal model that combined strategy evolution
with topological evolution. They used asynchronous update rule both for evo-
lution of strategy and structure by the Fermi function. In their model, topo-
logical evolution is manipulated in the following way: a pair of C-D or D-D
are chosen at random, the one may compete with the other to rewire the link,
rewiring being attempted to a random neighbor’s neighbor with certain prob-
ability determined by payoﬀ diﬀerence between them. Whereas in our model,
we argue that individuals are exclusively based on their self-interest. Even if
the individual is a cooperator, it could not bear the exploitation by defectors.
Furthermore, in our situation, individuals have enough inspection over their
opponents because they are engaged in a n-round PDG. Subsequently, each
agent can punish the most defective neighbor by dismissing the link, mean-
while seeks to establish links with cooperators. Especially, in our model the
agents are endowed with limited memory abilities by which they can punish
the most defective one. In addition, the way of associated time scales with
respect to evolution of strategy and structure is diﬀerent in our model from
the previous related works. As aforementioned, after playing n-round PDG
with neighbors, individuals update their local interactions according to the
game results. Such timely feedback mechanism is ubiquitous in natural world.

5

Besides, the adaption of network structure is much slower than evolution of
strategies in our model. Such feature reﬂects the fact that individuals may
not respond rapidly to the surrounding since maintaining and rewiring inter-
actions are costly to them. In previous investigations, the time scale often is
implemented in a stochastic manner. Although the implementation of time
scales in the literature is equivalent to our model in a way, our method may
be more plausible. Therefore, our model is diﬀerent from the previous ones
in these respects and captures the characteristics in real situation. In what
follows, we investigate under which conditions cooperation may thrive by ex-
tensive numerical simulations. And also, we show the eﬀects of the changing
parameters in our model on the evolution of cooperation.

3 Simulation results and discussions

We consider N individuals occupying the network vertices. Each interaction
between two agents is represented by an undirected edge (a total of NE). The
social networks are evolving in time as individuals adapt their ties. The aver-
age connectivity hki = 2NE/N is conserved during the topological evolution
since we do not introduce or destroy links. This point assumes a constrained
resource environment, resulting in limited possibilities of network conﬁgura-
tions. Besides, we impose that nodes linked by a single edge can not lose this
connection, thus the evolving networks are connected at all times. We calcu-

lated the amount of heterogeneity of the networks as h = N −1
(the variance of the network degree sequcence), where N(k) gives the number
of vertices with k edges. Additionally, in order to investigate the degree-degree
correlation pattern about the emerging social networks, we adopted the assor-
tativity coeﬃcient r suggested by Newman [29],

here ji, ki are the degrees of the vertices at the ends of the ith edge, with
i = 1, · · · , NE. Networks with assortative mixing pattern, i.e. r > 0, are those
in which nodes with large degree tend to be connected to other nodes with
many connections and vice versa.

The interplay between network structure and game dynamics is implemented
as following steps:

• Step (1): The evolution of strategy uses synchronous updating. Each agent
plays the PDG with its immediate neighbors for consecutive n rounds. After
each round, each individual adapts its strategy according to Eq. (3), and
records down the defection times of its every neighbors.

6

• Step (2): The update of individual’s local social interactions is asynchronous.
m agents are successively chosen at random to rewire the most adverse links
(if any) as shown in Fig. 1.

• Step (3): Repeat the above two steps until the population converges to an
absorbing state (full cooperators or defectors), or stop repeating the above
two steps after 105 generations.

We start from a homogeneous random graph by using the method in Ref. [30],
where all nodes have the same number of edges, randomly linked to arbitrary
nodes. Initially, an equal percentage of cooperators and defectors is randomly
distributed among the elements of the population. We run 100 independent
simulations for the corresponding parameters N, hki, n, m, b, and β. We
also compute the fraction of runs that ended up with 100% cooperators. If
the evolution has not reached an absorbing state after 105 generations, we
take the average fraction of cooperators in the population as the ﬁnal result.
Moreover, we observe the time evolution of the network structure and strategy,
including the degree-degree correlation coeﬃcient, the degree of heterogeneity,
the frequency of cooperators, the fraction of C-C/C-D/D-D links, etc. Finally,
we conﬁrm that our results are valid for diﬀerent population size N and edge
number NE.

We report a typical time evolution of the network structure as a result of the
adaption of social ties in Fig. 2, with relevant parameters N = 104, hki = 8,
b = 1.2, n = 6, β = 50, and m = 100. The emerging social network shows
disassortative mixing pattern, indicating that large-degree nodes tend to be
connected to low-degree nodes. The degree-degree correlation coeﬃcient r of
the network we started from is zero. Once the network structure adaption is in
eﬀect, disassortative mixing pattern will be developed. Since the rewiring pro-
cess is attempted to a random neighbor’s neighbor, thus the nodes with large
connectivity are more possible to be attached by others. Due to such “rich gets
richer”, inhomogeneity is induced as shown in Fig. 2(b). The amount of the
heterogeneity (degree variance) h increases in virtue of the rewiring process.
The inset in Fig. 2(b) plots the cumulative degree distribution of the station-
ary (ﬁnal) network, which exhibits high heterogeneity with a power-law tail.
Fig. 2(c) displays the evolution of cooperation. We ﬁnd that the frequency
of cooperators decreases at ﬁrst due to the temptation to defect, and then
because of the adaptive interactions, the cooperation level thrives gradually
and the population converges into an absorbing state of 100% cooperators.
The viability of cooperation is also in part promoted by the heterogeneity of
the underlying heterogeneity. From Fig. 2(d), we can see that local assortative
interactions between cooperators is enhanced by structural updating, while
assortative interactions between defectors and defectors is inhibited remark-
ably. The disassortativity between cooperators and defectors is promoted in
the beginning by strategy updating, however, being diminished eventually by
structural updating. Clearly, It is thus indicated that the interplay between

strategy and structure will facilitate the emergence of cooperation.

Let us consider the eﬀect of the amount of temptation to defect b to the evolu-
tion of cooperation. The relevant result is presented in Fig. 3. With increasing
b, the structural updating event must be suﬃciently frequent to guarantee
the survival of cooperators. In other words, the fraction of individuals chosen
for updating social ties should be accordingly increased to ensure the sustain-
ability of cooperators. When the value of b is enlarged, the defectors become
more favorable by the nature selection. Nevertheless, with the aid of struc-
tural updating, a small fraction of surviving cooperators promotes them into
hubs (large degree nodes), since they are attractive to neighborhood. Such
co-evolution of strategy and structure leads to highly heterogeneous networks
in which the cooperators become evolutionarily competitive as demonstrated
in Refs. [13,14,15]. For ﬁxed b, we observed a critical value mc for m, above
which the cooperator will wipe out defectors. For ﬁxed number of rounds n,
the critical value mc monotonously increases with increasing b, as shown at
the inset of Fig. 3. Therefore the prompt network adaption prevents coopera-
tors from becoming extinct, further, resulting in an underlying heterogeneous
social network which is the “green house” for cooperators to prevail under
strategy dynamics. Consequently, the entangled co-evolution of strategy and
structure promotes the evolution of cooperation among selﬁsh individuals.

gence of cooperation. Fix ﬁxed m and other parameters, there exists a critical
value for n, above which the cooperators will vanish as shown in Fig. 4. Indeed,
although the structural updating promotes the cooperators to a certain extent,
its role will be suppressed by the long-time strategy dynamics (corresponding

to large n). In our case, strategy dynamics is synchronous while structural up-
dating is asynchronous, namely, for each repetition in the simulations, strategy
updating happens at a frequency of N · n while the structural updating occurs
at a frequency of m. Hence the evolution of strategy is much more frequent
than that of structure. Thus, with large n, able defectors outperform coopera-
tors through strategy dynamics, even though the heterogeneity, resulting from

structural updating, is positive to evolution of cooperation. This result illus-
trates that even if the evolution of network topology is less frequent than the
evolution of strategy, cooperators still have chances to beat defectors under
appropriate conditions.

As is well known, cooperation is promoted in the situation where individuals
are constrained to interact with few others along the edges of networks with
low average connectivity [5,14,24]. To understand the cooperation in real-world
interaction networks of which the average connectivity is normally relatively
high, one needs new insight into the underlying mechanism promoting coop-
eration. Here, the role of average connectivity to evolution of cooperation is
inspected. In Fig. 5, it is shown that for increasing hki, the individuals must
be able to promptly adjust their social ties for cooperation to thrive, corre-
sponding to increasing m. Thus in order to explain the cooperation in commu-
nities with a high average number of social ties, the entangled co-evolution of
network structure and strategy should be taken into account simultaneously.
On static networks, maximum cooperation level occurs at intermediate aver-
age degree [31]. Moreover, when the connections are dense among individuals
(large average connectivity hki), cooperators die out due to mean-ﬁeld behav-
ior. Conversely, our results suggest that even in highly-connected network, on
account of the proposed structural adaption, cooperators can beat back the
defectors and dominate the populations.

Finally, we report the inﬂuence of changing intensity of selection β on the evo-
lution of cooperation in Fig. 6. It is indicated that reducing β will demote the
inﬂuence of the game dynamics, thereby increase the survivability of the less
ﬁt. Clearly, the smaller the value of β is, the smaller the critical value of m.
In fact, for small m, cooperators’ survival probability increases with decreas-
ing β although cooperators are generally less ﬁt. Such increased survivability
enhances assortative interactions between cooperators through network struc-
ture adaption. As a result, the critical value of m above which cooperators
dominate defectors decreases with decreasing β.

4 Conclusions

In summary, we have studied the coupled dynamics of strategy evolution
and the underlying network structure adaption. We provided a computational
model in which individuals are endowed with limited cognitive abilities in the
n-round PDG—limited memories for recording the defection times of oppo-
nents. After the n-round game, m randomly chosen individuals are allowed to
adjust their social ties based on the game results. The values of n and m are
corresponding to the associated time scales of strategy dynamics and struc-
tural updating respectively. We found that for a given average connectivity of

11

the population and the number of rounds, there is a critical value for the frac-
tion of individuals adapting their social interactions above which cooperators
wipe out defectors. In addition, the critical value of m above which cooper-
ators dominate defectors decreases with decreasing intensity of selection β.
Moreover, for increasing average connectivity, the individuals must be able to
swiftly adjust their social ties for cooperators to thrive. Finally, the emerg-
ing social networks at steady states exhibit nontrivial heterogeneity which is
the catalyst for emergence of cooperation among selﬁsh agents. To a certain
extent, our results shed some light on the underlying mechanism promoting
cooperation among selﬁsh individuals, and also provide an alternative insight
into the properties accruing to those networked systems and organizations in
natural world.

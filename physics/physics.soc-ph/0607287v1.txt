This paper describes an agent-based model of interacting ﬁrms, in which interacting ﬁrm agents
rationally invest capital and labor in order to maximize payoﬀ. Both transactions and production
are taken into account in this model. First, the performance of individual ﬁrms on a real transac-
tion network was simulated. The simulation quantitatively reproduced the cumulative probability
distribution of revenue, material cost, capital, and labor. Then, the response of the ﬁrms to a given
exogenous shock, deﬁned as a sudden change of gross domestic product, is discussed. The longer
tail in cumulative probability and skewed distribution of growth rate are observed for a high growth
scenario.

INTRODUCTION

The need for enterprise risk management, to improve
the business decision making process in a volatile envi-
ronment, has been increasingly recognized. It is essential
to develop a model that can capture various changes in
the business environment by considering the activities of
interacting ﬁrms. Many earlier studies in econophysics
have been concerned with the ﬁnancial market [1, 2], but
relatively few have addressed a fundamental understand-
ing of ﬁrm activities, such as derivation of the Pareto law
from the detailed balance condition, and the Gibrat law
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Quantitative discussions with existing
models have concentrated on the power index of wealth
distribution [10, 11, 12].

Existing agent-based ﬁrm models that are potentially
extensible to interacting ﬁrms are brieﬂy summarized and
their shortcomings are pointed out below. Simple mon-
etary exchange models have been developed by several
authors [13, 14, 15, 16]. A mean-ﬁeld version of these
models exhibits the stationary distribution of wealth with
a power-law tail for large wealth. The basic idea of this
model, that agents are randomly matched in pairs and try
to catch part of the otherfs wealth, might be problematic

∗Electronic address: yuichi.ikeda.ze@hitachi.com; Author to whom
correspondence should be addressed

from an economic point of view [17], despite the mod-
elfs success in reproducing a power-law tail. It is, how-
ever, noted that the random match problem was ﬁxed by
taking into account network structures, such as regular
networks and small-world networks, for neighbor agents
[15].

The gtheft and fraudh nature [18] of the above models
was resolved in a market mediated monetary exchange
model [19]. This model considers a market consisting
of N agents and two goods. Market mediated monetary
exchange is equivalent to maximizing the utility func-
tion of the Cobb-Douglass form. Although the monetary
exchange mechanism between agents is signiﬁcantly im-
provedCthis model is too simple to capture actual ﬁrm
activity. In particular, the aspect of production, which is
the most important economic activity for industrial ﬁrms,
is completely ignored. Thus, a market mediated mone-
tary exchange model is still unsatisfactory as a model of
interacting ﬁrms.

On the other hand, it is well known in economics liter-
ature that economic activities between industrial sectors,
such as production, can be analyzed by input-output
analysis [20]. Since input-output analysis is basically de-
signed to treat economic activities between industrial sec-
tors, its application to economic activities between ﬁrms
requires handling huge sparse matrices, which is compu-
tationally ineﬃcient. In addition, the dynamical aspects
of economic activities are neglected in input-output anal-
ysis. The next section describes our attempt to construct

a dynamical model of interacting ﬁrms incorporating pro-
duction activity.

In this paper, we propose a model of a ﬁrm network in
which interacting ﬁrm agents invest rationally in capital
and labor in order to maximize payoﬀ. Here, both trans-
actions and production are taken into account, in order to
create a realistic description of industrialized economies.
In the remainder of this paper, the agent-based model
of interacting ﬁrms, viewing inter-ﬁrm relationships as a
many-body problem, is explained (Section 2). Then, the
contents of ﬁrm data is described in Section 3; parameters
estimation and veriﬁcation of the model are described in
Section 4. Finally, the simulation results for the response
of the ﬁrm network to exogenous shock are discussed in
Section 5.

II. MODEL OF INTERACTING FIRMS

A new agent-based model which views inter-ﬁrm re-
lationships as a many-body problem is proposed in this
section to resolve the shortcomings of existing models
[21, 22, 23].
It is considered that a ﬁrm network con-
sists of interacting N agents, where value is added from
materials to end products through transactions and pro-
duction. It is postulated that past business performance
data is realized as a consequence of the Nash equilibrium,
which means each ﬁrm makes investment decisions in or-
der to maximize their payoﬀ under investment decisions
made by the other ﬁrms. Payoﬀ Pi of the ith ﬁrm is the
aggregated operating proﬁt:

Pi =

{Ri(t) − C(G)

(t) − riK (G)

(t) − L(G)

(t)},

where Ri(t), C(G)
(t), and ri are rev-
enue, materials cost, capital, labor, and interest rate for
debt, respectively. The suﬃx (G) indicates the Nash
equilibrium solution. Revenue R(t) of the ith ﬁrm is as-
sumed to be described by the time-evolution equation,

The second term of R.H.S. of Eq. (2) is an interaction
term due to business-to-business transactions, and is a
functional form of the product of the de-trended growth
rate δXi(t) multiplied by the interaction parameter kij,

fij = −kij(Xj(t) − XGDP (t))/σj .

(3)

Here Xj(t) = Rj(t)/Rj(t − 1) and XGDP (t) =
GDP (t)/GDP (t − 1) are the growth rates of Revenue of
the jth ﬁrm and gross domestic product (GDP), respec-
tively. Interaction between ﬁrms in Eq. (3) is written in
terms of the growth rate of revenue for transacting ﬁrms,
and contrasts sharply with the previous model [14], in

(cid:26)

If ﬁrm supplies product beyond demand, the price of the
product falls oﬀ. This causes saturation for revenue, but
does not aﬀect cost. As a result, there is lower proﬁt for
excess supply. The upper limit Si(t) is proportional to
GDP,

Si(t) = hiGDP (t).

Each ﬁrm has complete knowledge about the past in-
vestments of other ﬁrms. This assumption is called gper-
fect informationh. For a ﬁnite repeated game with per-
fect information, the Nash equilibrium of pure strategy
is obtained using backward induction [24]. In this model,
an approximate solution for the Nash equilibrium is ob-
tained using a genetic algorithm (GA) [25, 26]. The

FIG. 5: Obtained ﬁtness and aggregated proﬁt shows that all simulations reached maximum ﬁtness properly. Cases 1, 2, and

JPY. In the next section, parameter estimations and sim-
ulations are made for this ﬁrm network.

Analyzed transaction data is Nikkei transaction data,
which is part of the Nikkei Economic Electronic Data-
bank System. Field items of Nikkei transaction data
are (a) Name of ﬁrm, (b) Stock ticker, (c) Fiscal year,
(d) Type of transaction: supplier or customer, (e) Se-
quential number of transacting ﬁrm, and (f) Name of
transacting ﬁrm. The period of record is from JFY2000
to JFY2003. The number of ﬁrms recorded is approxi-
mately 13,000, and the number of transactions recorded
is approximately 110,000, for each JFY. Thus, each ﬁrm
lists an average of eight transactions. While the Nikkei
does not release its collection methods, it appears that
most of these data were obtained by questionnaires and
interviews.

A subset of a ﬁrm network was extracted by analyzing
transaction data and is shown in Fig. 3. The extracted
ﬁrm network consists of 16 listed ﬁrms belonging to a
conglomerate in Japan and those customers and suppli-
ers (79 ﬁrms) with revenue greater than 367, 740 × 106

IV. PARAMETERS ESTIMATION AND
VERIFICATIONS

Model parameters {ri, σi, kij , Ai, αi, βi, gi, hi, ∆Ki, ∆Li}

were estimated using ﬁnancial and transaction data for
ﬁrms and GDP data. A comprehensive description of
our parameter estimation can be found in [27]. In this
paper, only the estimation of the interaction parameter
is brieﬂy explained.

If the second term of R.H.S. of Eq.

(2) is replaced
by XGDP (t + 1), Eq.
(2) can be rewritten in vector
notation using the de-trended growth rate δXj(t) =
(Xj(t) − XGDP (t))/σj as follows:

δX(t + 1) = −kδX(t) + e.

(13)

Here a non-stationary process for revenue is rigorously
considered. The interaction parameter kij can be es-

timated using multi-regression analysis with Eq.
(13).
Hereafter, the interaction parameter estimated with Eq.
(13) is called gcross-correlation interactionh. If Eq. (13)
for the de-trended growth rate δXj(t) is approximated as
a stationary process, the following equation is obtained,

δX(t) = −kδX(t) + e.

(14)

Hereafter, the interaction parameter estimated with Eq.
(14) is called gsynchronous-correlation interactionh.

All parameters were estimated with data from JFY
1993 and JFY 2003. Simulations during JFY 1993 and
JFY 2003 were made with the estimated parameters and
initial values of JFY 1993 as veriﬁcation of the model.
Past GDP data from JFY 1993 to JFY 2003, shown in
Fig. 4, was used as input for the simulation. Four simu-
lation cases were set according to the type of interaction
and ﬁtness, as shown in Table I. Among the four cases,
Case 4 is expected to be the most accurate. Maximiza-
tion of ﬁtness was made using GA for the four cases,
with GA parameters as shown in Table II. Probabilities
of cross-over and mutation and fraction of elite were cho-
sen to obtain the fastest maximization of ﬁtness. The
number of generation was 100 for all cases. Fitness and
aggregated proﬁt is shown as a function of generation in
Fig. 5. Fitness and aggregated proﬁt are identical for
Cases 1 and 3 by deﬁnition. Fig. 5 shows that all sim-
ulations reached maximum ﬁtness properly. Aggregated
proﬁt, calculated using past ﬁnancial data, was 4.3×1013
JPY and compared with simulation results. Fig. 5 shows
that Cases 1, 2, and 4 approximately reproduced the cal-
culated value of aggregated proﬁt. However, simulation
results for Case 3 showed a large deviation from the cal-
culated value using past ﬁnancial data.

Simulation results of cumulative probability distribu-
tions for revenue, material cost, capital, and labor for
Case 4 were compared with past data in Fig. 6. Con-
siderable deviation is found in the tail part of the distri-
butions for revenue and cost, though agreement is fairly
good for capital and labor. Note that past data of cu-
mulative probability distribution is temporally stable for
capital and labor. If the cumulative probability distribu-
tion of capital and labor is stable, then the cumulative
probability distribution of material cost is stable through
Eqs. (4) and (5) in our model. In fact the simulation re-
sult in Fig. 6 (b) does not vary much with time, although
the data does vary with time. On the other hand, both
of simulation and data vary with time. This deviation
might suggest the need for a time-evolution equation for
cost, like Eq. (2) for revenue.

Simulation results of growth rate of revenue for Case 4
are compared with past data for JFY1994, JFY1998, and
JFY2003. Results are shown in Fig. 7. The left hand
side is the simulation, and the right hand side is past
data. Simulation and data do not agree very well, and
the growth rate distribution is wider for the simulation.
Although a detailed comparison of distribution shapes is
not possible, it seems that growth rate is sensitive for
accuracy.

where suﬃxes (S) and (D) indicate simulation and data,
respectively. Calculated relative error is shown in Table
III. Comparison shows that Case 2 is more accurate than
Case 1, and Case 4 is more accurate than Case 3. This
means that the decision making of individual ﬁrms led to
Nash equilibrium, not total optimization. Furthermore,
superiority of the cross-correlation interaction could not
be claimed from comparisons of Case 1 and Case 3, and
of Case 2 and Case 4. This means that de-trended growth
rate using GDP is an approximately stationary process.

V. SIMULATION WITH EXOGENOUS SHOCK

In this section the response of ﬁrms to a given exoge-
nous shock, deﬁned as a sudden change of GDP, is dis-
cussed. Three scenarios (high, medium, and low growth)
are given in Fig. 4 for JFY 2003 to JFY 2007 after the ex-
ogenous shock at JFY 2003. Performances of ﬁrm agents
for the high and the low growth scenarios were simulated
with initial values from JFY 2003.

Cumulative probability distributions for two scenarios
are shown in Fig. 8. A longer tail in cumulative proba-
bility was clearly observed for the high growth scenario.
In addition, calculated growth rates of revenue for two
scenarios are shown in Fig. 9. Mean, standard devia-
tion, skewness, and kurtosis of growth rate for the high
growth scenario are 1.113, 0.3618, 1.432, and 3.346, re-
spectively. Those for the low growth scenario are 1.101,
0.3273, 0.6320, and 1.007, respectively. This means that
a skewed distribution of growth rate was obtained for the
high growth scenario, as expected.

VI. SUMMARY

An agent-based model of interacting ﬁrms, in which in-
teracting ﬁrm agents rationally invest capital and labor
in order to maximize payoﬀ, was studied. Both transac-
tions and production are taken into account, to resolve
the shortcomings of existing models.

Cumulative probability and growth rate were simu-
lated in the period, where model parameters were es-
timated. The simulation quantitatively reproduces the
cumulative probability distribution of revenue, material

FIG. 6: Simulation results of cumulative probability distributions for revenue, material cost, capital, and labor for Case 4 were
compared with past data. Considerable deviation is found in the tail part of the distributions for revenue and cost, though
agreement is fairly good for capital and labor.

cost, capital, and labor. Comparisons between simula-
tions and data show that the decision making of individ-
ual ﬁrms led to a Nash equilibrium, not total optimiza-
tion. No apparent diﬀerence was observed for two kinds
of interactions. This means that a de-trended growth
rate using GDP is an approximately stationary process.
These comparisons suggest the need for a time-evolution
equation for material cost. Finally, the response of ﬁrm
agents to exogenous shock (the high and low growth
scenarios) was simulated. Cumulative probability and
growth rate distribution were compared for two scenar-

ios. A longer tail in cumulative probability and a skewed
distribution of growth rate were observed for the high
growth scenario.

Brieﬂy, our plans for further study are as follows. The
ﬁrst task concerns the asymmetric treatment of revenue
and material costs, i.e., only revenue is described by the
time-evolution equation and material cost is described
by the production function directly in the current model
(Eqs. (4) and (5)). The need for a time-evolution equa-
tion of material cost is suggested by veriﬁcation of the
cumulative probability distribution. Consideration of a

time-evolution equation of material cost is planned in the
next step. The second task concerns the static ﬁrm net-
work, i.e., the list of linked ﬁrms is obtained by analyzing
the transaction data of a certain ﬁscal year and is not up-
dated during the simulation. In fact, the functional form
of interaction in Eq. (3) is analogous to the inter-atomic
force of crystal lattice, where the equilibrium position of
the atom is assumed. Interaction without assuming equi-
librium position, such as the Lennard-Jones potential or
the Morse potential, might be required to consider recon-
nection of the ﬁrm network. Network analysis of multi-
year transaction data is strongly desired for this purpose.
The search for suitable data and its network analysis is
planned in the next step.

scenarios at JFY2007 are shown. A longer tail in cumulative
probability was clearly observed for the high growth scenario.

We study the interplay between evolutionary game and network structure and show how the dy-
namics of the game aﬀect the growth pattern of the network and how the evolution of the network
inﬂuence the cooperative behavior in the game. Simulation results show that the payoﬀ preferential

the power-law exponent γ controlled by a model parameter. Moreover, we investigate the average
path length and the assortative mixing features. The obtained results indicate that the network has
small-world and positive assortative behaviors, which are consistent with the observations of some
real social networks. In parallel, we found that the evolution of the underlying network structure
remarkably promotes the cooperation level of the game. Furthermore, we provide detrended ﬂuctu-
ation analysis for the time series of cooperator density. Interestingly, we found 1/f scaling behavior,
which suggests that a long-range correlation exists in the evolution of cooperation in the game.

Game theory provides a useful framework for describ-
ing the evolution of systems consisting of selﬁsh individ-
uals [1, 2, 3]. The prisoner’s dilemma game (PDG) as a
metaphor for investigating the evolution of cooperation
has drawn considerable attention [4, 5]. In the PDG, un-
stable cooperation is contrary to the real observations,
and this disagreement motivates numerous extensions of
the original model to better reproduce the emergence and
persistence of cooperation [6, 7, 8, 9]. Enlightened by the
work of Nowak and May [10], who ﬁgured out that the
PDG with a simple spatial structure can induce emer-
gence of cooperation, recent attention has been focused
on the eﬀect of the underlying network structure on the
cooperative behavior in the game [11, 12, 13]. With re-
cent discoveries of small-world and scale-free structural
features in the real-world networks, evolutionary games
are naturally considered on networks with these kinds of
properties [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Interestingly, San-
tos and Pacheco found that “scale free networks provide
a unifying framework for the emergence of cooperation”
[21].

Most studies of evolutionary games over networks are
based on static network structures. However, it has been
pointed out that the network structure may coevolve with
the game [22, 23, 24, 25], where each individual would
choose its co-players to gain more beneﬁts, which induces
the evolution of their relationship network. Such inter-
play between networks and the dynamics taking place
on them also exists in traﬃc-networked systems. Some
previous works about weighted networks suggest that it
is indeed the traﬃc increment spurs the evolution of the
network to maintain the system’s normal and eﬃcient
functioning [26, 27]. From this perspective, in the present
paper we propose an evolutionary network model with
respect to the interplay between the game and the net-
work for characterizing the dynamics of some social and
economic systems. In the model, each node represents

an agent who plays the snowdrift game (SG) with all its
immediate neighbors simultaneously. The SG, an alter-
native to the PDG, is proposed because of the diﬃculty
in accurately quantifying the payoﬀs [28, 29]. The SG,
equivalent to the hawk-dove game, is of much biological
interest. Since growth is a common feature among net-
worked systems [30], we assume that the network con-
tinuously grows by adding new agents to the existent
network. We focus on the evolution of the network struc-
ture together with the cooperative behavior reﬂected by
the density of cooperators. Simulation results show that
the obtained networks follow a power-law distribution,
p(k) ∼ k−γ, with exponent γ tuned by a model param-
eter. The average distance of the network scales loga-
rithmically with the network size, which indicates the
network has a small-world eﬀect. Interestingly, the assor-
tative mixing properties generated by our model demon-
strate that the model can well mimic some social net-
works. In parallel, with the expension of the network, the
density of cooperators increases and approaches a stable
value, which gives a new explanation for the emergence
and persistence of cooperation.

Let us ﬁrst introduce brieﬂy the snowdrift game. Two
players engaged in the SG have to choose between coop-
eration (C) and defection (D). In any encounter, if they
both take strategy C, both receive R payoﬀs; whereas
they get P payoﬀs if both choose D. If one takes action
D and the other takes C, the defector gains the highest
payoﬀ T while the cooperator gains the lowest payoﬀ S.
Thus, the rank of four payoﬀ values is T > R > S > P .
SG and PD diﬀers only by the ordering of P and S. Fol-
lowing common practice, the SG is rescaled with R = 1,
T = 1 + r and S = 1 − r, where r is a tunable parameter
ranging from 0 to 1. Thus, the payoﬀs can be charac-
terized by a single parameter without losing generality.
Although, compared with the PDG, the payoﬀ rank of
the SG favors the emergence of cooperation, the cooper-

ation is still unstable in the SG, which results from the
highest payoﬀ of D.

Our model starts from m0 = 10 randomly connected
nodes, each of which represents a player. Initially, the
nodes are randomly assigned to be either strategy C or D.
Players interact with all their neighbors simultaneously
and get payoﬀs according to the preset payoﬀ parameter.
The total payoﬀ of a certain player is the sum over all
its encounters. Then, every node i randomly selects a
neighbor j for possible updating its strategy. The proba-
bility that i follows the strategy of the selected node j is
determined by the total payoﬀ diﬀerence between them,
i.e.,

Wij =

1
1 + exp[(Mi − Mj)/T ]

,

(1)

where Mi and Mj are the total payoﬀs of i and j at the
moment of the encounter. T characterizes “noise” and,
following the previous works [31, 32, 33, 34, 35], we set it
to be 0.1. As time evolves, a steady state, reﬂected by the
density of cooperators, will be attained. Subsequently, a
new node with m (= 3) links is attached to the existent
network, preferentially choosing nodes with higher values
of payoﬀs, i.e.,

Πnew→i =

hMii + W
Pj(hMji + W )

,

(2)

where hMii and hMji are the total payoﬀs of i and j ob-
tained by averaging over 100 time steps in the case of
steady state. W is a tunable parameter, which reﬂects
the original payoﬀ values of the player when it joins into
the game system. For simplicity, we set W be a constant.
The value-based preferential selection takes into account
the “rich gets richer” characteristic and couples the dy-
namics of the evolutionary game and the evolution of

the underlying network. After a new node joins into the
network, all players’ strategies are reassigned randomly.
Then, repeat the above procedures, and the network size
gradually grows.

Numerical simulations are performed to quantify the
structural properties of the obtained networks. In Fig-
ure 1, we show the cumulative degree distribution Pc(k),
which is the probability of ﬁnding a node with degree
larger than k, in networks of size N = 10000. The distri-
butions clearly exhibit power-law behavior, Pc(k) ∼ k−γ,
in a broad range of degrees with a cut-oﬀ for very large
degrees. These results indicate that the empirically ob-
served scale-free structure can be generated from the cou-
pling of the game and the evolution of the network, which
may be an explanation for the heterogenous structure of
many social and economical networked-systems. More-
over, the exponent γ is a function of W , which makes
our model more general for mimicking a variety of real
networks. We have checked that the parameter r has
slight eﬀect on γ, while W plays a major role. We also
note that the observed power-law distributions are inde-
pendent of the time steps, which indicates that our model
has no ﬁnite-size eﬀect.

Average path length is a key measure for quantifying
the small-world eﬀect, which is widely observed in the
real world [36]. The average path length hLi of a network
is deﬁned as

where dij is the shortest path length from node i to node
j, and N is the network size. We perform simulations on
hLi as a function of network size for diﬀerent values of
parameter W . Each data point is obtained by averaging

that for all the values of W , hLi increases logarithmi-
cally with the growth of the network, but the slopes for
diﬀerent W show slight diﬀerences. These results demon-
strate that the small-world eﬀect can be reproduced by
the proposed model.

Another important structural feature useful for mea-
suring the correlation among nodes of a network is the
assortative mixing coeﬃcient A, or called degree-degree
correlation [37, 38], which is deﬁned as follows:

where ji and ki are the degrees of the two nodes at the
end of the ith edge, with i = 1, · · · , M (M is the to-
tal number of edges of the observed graph). Two main
classes of possible correlations have been observed in the
real world: assortative behavior if A > 0, which indicates
that large-degree nodes are preferentially connected with
other large-degree nodes, and disassortative if A < 0,
which denotes that links are more easily built between
large-degree nodes and small-degree ones. As demon-
strated in Ref [37], almost all social networks show pos-
itive values of A, while others, including technological
and biological networks, show negative A. However, the
mechanism that leads to the basic diﬀerence between
these two classes networks remains unclear [39]. We
calculate the assortative mixing coeﬃcient A to check
whether the generated networks by our model are suit-
able representations of social systems. Figure 3 shows A
as a function of parameter W for diﬀerent network sizes.
One can see that assortative behavior occurs as W in-
creases, which is essentially independent of N . Thus, the
stable assortative feature demonstrates that the model

can well capture the key distinguished structural prop-
erty of social networks.

So far we have studied the evolution of the underly-
ing network structure inﬂuenced by the game. Next, we
turn to the eﬀect of changing network structure on the
cooperative behavior in the game. The key quantity for
measuring the cooperation level of the game is the den-
sity of cooperators, ρC [15]. Figure 4 shows that ρC
depends on network size N for diﬀerent parameter W
in the case of r = 0.8, where ρC for each value of N
is obtained by averaging 200 time steps after the net-

increase of the network size by adding new individuals,
the cooperative behavior is remarkably promoted. When
the network is small and homogenous, cooperation rarely
occurs, reﬂected by ρC = 0; while as new nodes continu-
ously join into the existent network, the cooperation level
sharply increases, together with the emergence of hetero-
geneity of the network, which is a scale-free property.
In Fig. 4 (a) and (b), one can ﬁnd that after the net-
work size exceeds a speciﬁc value, approximately 2000,
ρC tends to be stable with small ﬂuctuations around the
average value. These results reveal that the growth of the
underlying relationship structure does contribute to the
emergence and persistence of the cooperation. Actually,
most real networks are not static but growing. From this
viewpoint, the ubiquitous cooperative behavior may be
produced by the common mechanism of network growth.
Moreover, the lower the value of W , the larger the stable
value of ρC . As shown in Fig. 1, lower W corresponds to
stronger heterogeneity, which results in a higher coopera-
tion level. Our study is consistent with the recent report

of Santos and Pacheco [21], who found that in sharp con-
trast with regular networks, cooperation denominates for
both PDG and SG on scale-free networks. As shown in
Fig. 4 (b), it is obvious that a larger r leads to a lower
cooperation level, because larger r is in favor of defectors.
The cooperation density ρC as a function of the payoﬀ
parameter r is shown in Fig. 5. One can see that ρC is
a decreasing function of r for all diﬀerent values of W .

To study in more detail the evolutionary behavior of
cooperation, we perform the detrended ﬂuctuation anal-
ysis (DFA) on ρC versus N . DFA method is usually
used for quantifying the correlation properties on the ba-
sis that a correlated time series can be mapped into a
self-similar process by integration [40, 41, 42, 43]. The
correlation can be reﬂected by the measure of self-similar
features. DFA can be applied to the non-stationary time
series. In the present work, during the evolution, ρC may
not reach a steady state, thus DFA method is preferred.
The DFA method is described as follows: (1) Consider a
time series g(i) (i = 1, · · · , N ), integrate the time series
k
g(i) and subtract the mean hgi, y(k) =
i=1[g(i) − hgi];
P
(2) divide the integrated signal y(k) into nonoverlapping
boxes of equal size n (scale of the analysis); (3) in each
box, ﬁt y(k) by a polynomial function, yf it(k), which is
called a local trend; (4) detrend the integrated time se-
ries, y(k), by subtracting the local trend, yf it(k), in each
box; (5) calculate the root-mean-square ﬂuctuations of
this integrated and detrended time series,

F (n) =

[y(t) − yf it(t)]2.

Repeat the above procedure over all time scales to get the

relationship between F (n) and n. Typically, a power-law
scaling F (n) ∼ nα exists between F (n) and n, where the
exponent α, called the correlation parameter or scaling
parameter, characterizes the correlation properties of the
time series. If α = 0.5, the series is uncorrelated; in the
case of α > 0.5 or α < 0.5, the series is positively cor-

f , which is usu-
ally called 1/f scaling noise and is widely observed in the
real world. Figure 5 shows F (n) as a function of n for
diﬀerent values of parameter W . Interestingly, for W =0,
perfect 1/f noise is reproduced. As far as we know, the
behavior of 1/f like scaling in the study of evolution-
ary game is rarely reported [20]. As W increases, the
long-range correlation is weakened, which is reﬂected by
the decrease of α. The observed non-trivial long-range
correlation indicates that the networks undergoes a self-
organized evolution process.

In summary, we have studied the interplay of the evo-
lutionary game and the relevant network structure. Sim-
ulation results indicate that both scale-free structural
property and high cooperation level result from the in-
terplay between the game and the network. Moreover,
the resultant networks reproduce some typical features
of social networks, including small-world and positive as-
sortative mixing properties. The DFA method is used for
analyzing the correlation of the time series of cooperator
density. The result shows that long-range correlation ex-
ists in the evolution of cooperation. However, some issues
still remain that deserve further study, such as the evo-
lution of connections among existing nodes, as discussed
in previous works [39, 44, 45].

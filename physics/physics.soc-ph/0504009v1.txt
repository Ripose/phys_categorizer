Abstract

In this study, we establish a network structure of the Korean stock market, one
of the emerging markets, with its minimum spanning tree through the correlation
matrix. Base on this analysis, it is found that the Korean stock market doesn’t
form the clusters of the business sectors or of the industry categories. When the
MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc.) index is exploited, we found
that the clusters of the Korean stock market is formed. This ﬁnding implicates that
the Korean market, in this context, is characteristically diﬀerent form the mature
markets.

1 Introduction

The stock price of a given company is a mutual inference of various infor-
mation, such as company revenue, competition performance, currency policy,
business barometers, political situation, and so on. In other words, when the
company price is estimated, there are numerous complicated factors that must
be confronted. In the stock market, all companies are interconnected and con-
sequently their stock prices are correlated. This correlation, known as the
potential of deep inner impact, forms the stock market network.

Network theory, a fruitful approach to analyzing complex systems, has been
extended into a wide range of subjects, including the Internet, WWW, biol-
ogy, and economy[1,2,3] since Erd¨os and R´enyi (ER) introduced their model,
which generates a random network with the number of nodes and connection
probability, known as the ER model[4]. A stock market is one of inhomoge-
neous network systems; every company has a diﬀerent revenue, performance,
stock price, market capitalization and name.

Recently, Barab´asi and Albert(BA) introduced the scale-free network[5]. Thet
constructed the network by the preferential attachment rule, the essential
point to understanding the stock market network. We consider the preferential
attachment rule as the connectivity of an inﬂuential company in stock market
- a more inﬂuential company has more connections with other companies.
The interaction strengths in the network system are important, many models
are binary networks, whose links have 0 (not connected) or 1 (connected).
Non-binary network, recently introduced by Yook, Jeong and Barab´asi(YJB),
takes a continuous weight between 0 and 1[6]. We regard companies as nodes
(vertices) of the network, their interactions between stock price changes as
links (edges) and correlation coeﬃcients as weights.

The minimum spanning tree (MST) is widely used to identify clusters of com-
panies and stocks[7,8], after Mantegna ﬁrst constructed the network based on
the correlations[9]. There have been several attempts to obtain clustering of
the stock market[10,11,12]. We choose the MST because simply observe the
topology of the stork market network by the MST.

While there has been an abundance of literature concerning mature markets
- especially, the US market - relatively little work has been published in con-
nection with emerging markets such as those of Korea, BRICs and Eastern
Europe. Mature markets have a long history, abundant liquidity and ﬁnancial
data, and also are characterized by market stability. These factors simplify
research on the mature market relative to that of emerging markets. The
model of the mature market cannot be applied to an emerging market[13] and
thus it seems likely that it will be necessary to determine the model that is
appropriate to each market.

We aim to explore the topological characteristics of the Korean market, a
representative emerging market. Kim et al. introduced a non-binary network
system showing scale-free behavior in the S&P500[14]. And we study the tax-
onomy and network topology of the Korean market. The S&P500 forms clus-
ters with the business sectors and the portfolio optimization with these clusters
is successful[8].

2 Financial Properties of the Korean Stock Market

The Korean stock market is much smaller than the US stock market. There
are two stock markets in Korea - the Korea Stock Exchange (KSE) and the
KOSDAQ. About 700 companies are listed on the KSE and the total market
capitalization is approximately $400 billion. In the case of the KOSDAQ, there
are 900 listed companies with $30 billion in market capitalization. In the NYSE
and NASDAQ, there are thousands of listed companies and the total market
capitalization is approximately $11 trillion. From above, we can calculate a
company’s average market capitalization of Korea and the US very roughly.
The US companies’ average market capitalization is ten times greater than
that of Korea, which is about $2 million.

The most important Korean stock index is the KOSPI200 with 200 com-
panies chosen by the KSE. Whereas the S&P500 contains companies listed
on the NYSE and NASDAQ, the KOSPI200 has only 200 KSE companies,
and no KOSDAQ companies. There are two well known methods to obtain
a stock price index; one is a price-equally-weighted index and the other a
value-weighted index. The DJIA index is calculated by the former while the
S&P index is by the latter. In the former, every company has the same in-
ﬂuencing power on the index despite diﬀerences in market capitalization. In
contrast, value-weighted indexes are suitable to measure the inﬂuencing power
of companies. The KOSPI200 is a value-weighted index and is appropriate the
purposes of this study.

Table 1 shows the market capitalization of some largest companies listed on
the S&P500 and KOSPI200. This quantity refers to the economic scale of a
given company and the fraction of total market capitalization in a stock market
such as a commodity market. (·) denotes their symbols. The total portions of
top 10 S&P500 companies are 22.82%, that of KOSPI200 are 49.13%. In the
KOSPI200, SEC, only one company, occupies 21.94%, but GE is only 3.39%.
It means that KOSPI200 index is more sensitive o the inﬂuence of a few top
companies.

Table 2 shows the KSE’s shareholdings by investor group. We can notice few
foreign investors having large companies’ stocks. Thus, the foreigner’s trading
pattern is important to the Korean stock market. A large part of luqiudity is
supllied by the foreigner. Thus, in spite of Korean prosperity, a recession in
the US can cause a slump in the Korean stock market.

3 Methodology

We create a network of KOSPI 200 companies; every node (company) has a
diﬀerent number of links (connections) and weights (correlations). In general,
we consider a large ﬁrm from the viewpoint of size, market capitalization and
share stock price to be dominan on the stock market. Hence, such a company
forms a hub in the network system. We call this company powerful.

We use the cross-correlations in stock price changes between KOSPI200 com-
panies from Jan. 2001 to Jun. 2004. Let Yi(t) be the stock price of company
i. Then, the log-return of the stock price is deﬁned as

Si(t) = ln Yi(t + ∆t) − ln Yi(t),

where ∆t means time interval. In this paper ∆t is one day. The cross-correlations
between stock i and j can be written as

ρij =

< SiSj > − < Si >< Sj >
i > − < Si >2)(< S2

j > − < Sj >2)

q(< S2

where < . . . > means a time average over the period. These correlation coeﬃ-
cients form a correlation matrix C. This matrix is a symmetric N×N matrix.
Then ρij varies between -1 and 1. If stock i and j are completely correlated
(anti-correlated), ρij = +1(−1). The case of ρij = 0 means they are uncorre-
lated.

Companies correspond to nodes, which are fully connected to one another
through N(N − 1)/2 links. Each link is assigned a weight wij(= wji), simply
deﬁned from the cross-correlation coeﬃcient; wij = ρij.

The inﬂuence strength (IS) is a physical quantity to measure how strongly a
node inﬂuences other nodes. This quantity is deﬁned as the sum of the weights
on the links incident upon a given node i,

(2)

(3)

qi = X
j6=i

wij,

where j denotes the links connected to the node i. Since the weight is dis-
tributed in the range [-1,1], the IS can be negative. Merely, we hope to de-
termine how strongly a given company aﬀects other companies, whether pos-
itively or negatively. Thus, we deal with the absolute magnitude of the IS;
|qi|

4 Characteristics of the Korean Stock Market

In Fig. 1, we plot the IS distribution PK(|q|) of KOSPI200. Kim et al. found
the IS distribution of S&P500 follows a power law distribution, PSP (|q|) ∼
|q|−η[14]. The exponent η is estimated to be ηSP ∼ 1.8. It is known that as
the degree exponent is smaller in SF networks, the connectivity of a node with
a large degree becomes higher, and hence the network tends to be more cen-
tralized to a few nodes. In other words, a powerful company is more powerful.
The IS component of the S&P500 is smaller than the degree exponent values
for SF networks in the real world such as the Internet and the World-Wide
Web[1,2]. However, we can’t ﬁnd power-law distribution in Fig. 1.

By Table 1, the largest company from the viewpoint of a market capitalization
in the S&P500 is General Electric (GE); its fraction of the total is 3.39%. In
the case of the KOSPI200, Samsung Electronics Corporations (SEC) occupies
this position; its fraction is 21.94%. As such, we consider the KOSPI200’s hub
to be more powerful, and the network is more centralized to this company
compared to the S&P500. However, Fig. 1 shows this assumption is not valid.

We obtain the asset tree through the minimum spanning tree (MST) to ﬁnd
the diﬀerence between the S&P500 and KOSPI200. GE can be considered
the hub of the S&P500’s MST[9,8]. However, we cannot ﬁnd any hub in the
KOSPI200. In general, investors of the Korean stock market consider SEC as
the center of the market and the KOSPI Index increases with an increase in
SEC value. However, the SEC is located far away from the center (Fig. 2).
This means the fraction of SEC’s market capitalization is large, and as such
the KOSPI Index moves with SEC while most companies’ stocks do not follow
this trend. Neither SEC nor the others in Table 1 is the center of KOSPI’s
MST. GE inﬂuences its neighbors. Hence, they move with its movement, and
the index follows the trend of GE. Even though SEC has a weak inﬂuence
on its neighbors, its market capitalization’s power is very strong (Table 1),
and as a result the index follows it. The weak inﬂuence of SEC means weak
weights of links and no preferential attachment. Hence, we cannot ﬁnd WSF
behaviors in the Korean market in comparison with the American market.

The American stock market is a mature market. There are numerous powerful
companies such as GE, Microsoft and Citigroup. These companies have similar
market capitalization and inﬂuence power on the market. In the Korean stock
market, an emerging market, there is a great gap between the SEC and the
others - even though, 9 companies of Table 1 - with a viewpoint of the market
capitalization.

We hope to make groups of stocks in the market. If we can make reason-
able groups of stocks, they can then be applied to the portfolio optimization

5

method. Before making these groups, we introduce some terminology. The
term branch is deﬁned as a subset of a tree, to all nodes that share a speci-
ﬁed common parent and cluster as a subset of a branch. There are two kinds
of clusters. One is a complete cluster and the other is incomplete. A com-
plete cluster contains all the companies of the studied set belonging to the
corresponding branch, so that none are left outside the cluster. Onnela et al.
found that clusters of S&P500 with business sector or industry categories are
mostly incomplete, but come very close to being complete clusters, only miss-
ing one or two companies of the cluster[8]. We consider this situation as a
complete cluster from the viewpoint of practical portfolio optimization. As a
result, portfolio optimization with this concept is successful. However, we can-
not make clusters of KOSPI200 with business sectors or industry categories.
In addition, they made the portfolio using the central node (GE), but the
KOSPI200 has no single central hub, and thus this method cannot be applied
to the Korean situation.

We attempted to make groups of KOSPI200 with other rules except business
sectors or industry category. Most Korean major companies are members of
conglomerate forms of enterprise. For example, Samsung Electronics Co. is a
member of Samsung Conglomerate; in Korea this is known as the Samsung
Group. This conglomerate is comprised of many companies, i.e., Samsung Elec-
tronics Co., Samsung Life Insurance, Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Samsung
Petrochemical Co., Samsung Corporation, and so on. They have deep relation-
ships and co-operation of ﬁnance, services, development, and so on. As such,
their stocks can be considered a group. However, we cannot ﬁnd any group
with Korean major conglomerates - Samsung, LG, SK, Hyundai, and so on.

We consider patterns of Korean domestic investor dealings in stocks. Foreign
investment patterns are important signals and information for the Korean
stock market. Domestic investors think foreigners deal with standards and
developed trading rules. Thus, they refer to foreign investor trading. We apply
the MSCI index to make groups of Korean stocks. Morgan Stanley Capital
International Inc. (MSCI) is one of the leading providers of equity indices and
oﬀers the most widely used international equity benchmarks by international
investors. MSCI Equity Indices are designed to fulﬁll the investment needs of
a wide variety of global institutional market participants. These include many
categories of indices, i.e. Sector, Industry Group and Industry Indices, Global,
Regional and Country Equity indices, and so on. We focus on the MSCI Korean
Index - one of the MSCI Country Equity Indices. Fig. 3 shows that we can
make groups with MSCI Index. While all of them are incomplete clusters, they
can be considered complete clusters from the viewpoint of practical portfolio
optimization. This is the most acceptable grouping method for the Korean
market.

5 Conclusions

We have studied the characteristics of the Korean stock market and obtained
some characteristics that diﬀer from the US market. The pertinent question is
why does the Korean stock market have diﬀerent properties? One possible rea-
son is the composition of ﬁrms. The history of mature markets is longer than
that of emerging markets. Thus, the mature markets have many companies
including several large ﬁrms. In the case of the Korean market, there are only
a few large ﬁrms, e.g. SEC; these corporations are very large in comparison to
others. As such, these large ﬁrms are separated from the other companies of
the market. This accounts for why there is no hub in the Korean stock market.
We don’t know yet whether this is the characteristics of emerging markets or
only Korean characteristics.

The other is the trading culture and globalization. Foreigner trading patterns
are much important in the Korean market. Globalization has progressed very
rapidly and the inﬂuencing power of a few developed countries has become
stronger and stronger. At present, many stock markets’ synchronization to
the US market is observed. In other words, the whole markets in the world
are synchronized. Thus, we can ﬁnd clusters in terms of the MSCI index. If a
speciﬁed company’s stock is included in the MSCI index, it is more synchro-
nized to the foreign market and regarded as a good company’s stock to the
Korean market.

All markets throughout the world have characteristics of their own. We need
to study each market with its own properties and make groups of markets.

We wish to thank S.-W. Son, O. Kwon and C. Kim for helpful discussions and
supports.

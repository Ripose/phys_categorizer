Abstract

We study the topology of several music recommendation networks, which rise from relationships

between artist, co-occurrence of songs in playlists or experts’ recommendation. The analysis un-

covers the emergence of complex network phenomena in this kind of recommendation networks,

built considering artists as nodes and their resemblance as links. We observe structural properties

that provide some hints on navigation and possible optimizations on the design of music recom-

mendation systems. Finally, the analysis derived from existing music knowledge sources provides

a deeper understanding of the human music similarity perceptions.

Music is ubiquitous in human societies. Music generates communities of musi-

cians [1, 2], communities of listeners. Nevertheless, the way music links people is

certainly diverse and sometimes unexpected. In this work we focus on networks

where musicians (or bands) are the fundamental nodes and are linked to others if

they perform or compose similar music. This information is extracted from main

on-line music recommendation systems: AllMusicGuide, MSN-Entertainment,

Amazon and Launch-Yahoo!. Music recommendation systems are constructed

to assist users to navigate through music collections, where navigation consists

of guided links among artists. When the user selects an artist, a certain num-

ber of alternative artists are suggested, which in principle should be of his/her

interest.

In our study of the structure of diﬀerent music recommendation systems

we ﬁnd characteristics which inﬂuence systems’ usability. Our results show

that despite some common features, such as small-worldness, diﬀerent network

characteristics exist, such as the link degree distribution. We show that there

exist a relation between the link degree distribution and the construction of the

networks. Networks constructed by collaborative eﬀort are scale-free whereas

networks with human experts supervising the links are exponential. This raises

a discussion on the main forces driving the creation of the networks and hence

their quality and potential uses. If preferential attachment takes place, as in

the scale-free networks under study, the recommendations are biased towards

popular items. On the other hand exponential networks are more faithful to the

underlying music similarity.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays access to music is possible by querying artists or song names —editorial data—

or browsing recommendations generated by collaborative ﬁltering —i.e: recommendation

systems that exploit information such as “users that bought this album also bought this

album”. An obvious drawback is that consumers need to know the name of the song or the

artist, or an important number of consumers must have heard and rated the music. This

situation makes it diﬃcult for users to access and navigate through the vast amount of music

2

composed and performed by unknown new artists, which is available on-line in an increasing

number of sites.

In this work, complex network measurements [3, 4] are used to analyse the topology of

networks underlying the main music recommendation systems. The properties that emerge

raise a discussion on the underlying forces driving collaborative systems and expert-guided

networks. We can also obtain some hints about how much of the network structure is due

to content similarity and how much to the self-organization of the network. Therefore, it

can shed new light on the design and validation of music similarity measures and its evalua-

tion [5]. Furthermore, it uncovers possible optimisations when designing music information

systems, such as the optimal number of links between artists or the shortest path from artist

to artist. In this sense, recommendation networks can be optimized by adding (or removing)

links to facilitate navigating from artist to artist in a short number of clicks. Finally, we can

obtain information about which artist has more links or which genres are more extended.

This kind of information may help to understand the dynamics of certain aspects of music

evolution, e.g: how did an artist get popular or how the music genres emerged.

II. GRAPH DATASET

We have gathered information from four diﬀerent music recommendation networks; All-

MusicGuide [6], Amazon [7], Launch-Yahoo!

[8] and MSN-Entertainment

[9], and we

have created a graph for each source, taking the ‘ ‘similarity” between artists as the linking

parameter. A graph is constructed as follows: each node represents a music artist whereas

an edge denotes a similarity among them. The decision to create a link between two artists

depends on the recommendation systems criterion, which can be diﬀerent from network to

network. Therefore, it is important to deﬁne how links between artists are created. The

main characteristics of each network are summarized as follows:

• MSN-Entertainment (MSN) is a portal to access multimedia content. Music can be

accessed using editorial metadata, i.e., artist name or song title, as well as navigating

through music styles. Another browsing feature, the SoundsLike Artists allows users to

navigate from artist to artist that sounds similar. Ratings of similarity between artists

are constructed from user contributions. It seems to follow a collaborative ﬁltering

approach [10] to create links between artists.

3

• Amazon is an on-line retailer of music, it uses item-to-item collaborative ﬁltering to

recommend albums and artists, based on consumer ratings and habits [10, 11]. We

study the network constructed by using similar artists’ links. It is worth noting that

in the Amazon network links are indirectly created by users whose knowledge of the

network nodes is limited.

• AllMusicGuide (AMG) is a database of music content covering facts about albums

an artists where several descriptions are considered, such as styles, moods, country

of origin, even the birth date of the artist. An editorial group, made of a substantial

number of music experts, is responsible of the addition of new nodes (artists) and

their connections. Contributions from the users of the system are also accepted, but

always under the supervision of the editorial group. In this sense, it is a network where

a ﬁltering process has been done. AMG deﬁnes diﬀerent networks, e.g.:

inﬂuences,

roots, performed songs by, and so on. In this work, in order to compare with other

music recommendation networks, we focus in the network of similarity between artists.

• Launch-Yahoo! (Yahoo) is a music entertainment portal which among other features

allows to navigate by similar artist. No information is given about how links between

artists are created. Nevertheless, as we will see, some conclusions can be extracted

from the analysis of the network properties.

As a general feature, all networks are directed, which means that an artist A (e.g. “Oasis”)

can be similar to an artist B (e.g. “The Beatles”), but not necessary in the opposite direction.

The number of artists (n) and links (m) of each network is summarized in Table I.

III. NETWORK PROPERTIES

Before going to the data analysis, let us introduce some deﬁnitions and concepts that

will be used in this paper. A network or graph is a set of nodes (also called vertices) con-

nected via links (also called edges). Networks connected by directed links are called directed

networks while networks connected by undirected edges are called undirected networks. In

order to take a decision about the network structure we have measured the following graph

parameters:

4

• Degree: The degree ki of a vertex i is the number of connections of that vertex and

hki is the average of ki over all the vertices of the network.

• Degree distribution: The degree distribution P (k) is the proportion of nodes that have

a degree k. The shape of the degree distribution can help to identify they type of

network: regular networks have a constant distribution, since all nodes have the same

amount of degrees, “random networks” [12, 13] —as described by the Erd¨os-R´enyi

model—have a Poisson degree distribution and “scale-free networks” have power-law

distributions
[20]. It is a standard practice to compute the cumulative degree dis-
tribution Pc(k) = Pk′>k P (k′) since it ﬁlters ﬂuctuations of P (k) which is frequently
rather noisy. In a directed graph (all graphs under study) we can calculate P in(k) and

P out(k) as the in and out degree (for incoming/outgoing links) respectively.

• Average shortest path: Two vertices i and j are connected if one can go from i to

j following the edges in the graph. The path from i to j may not be unique. The

minimum path distance or geodesic path dij is the shortest path distance from i to j.

The average shortest path over every pair of vertices is

hdi =

1
1
2n(n + 1))

dij

X
i≥j

The maximum geodesic path between any two vertices in the graph is known as di-

ameter.

• Clustering coeﬃcient: The clustering coeﬃcient estimates the probability that two

neighboring vertices of a given vertex are neighbors themselves. In music networks,

it relates to the probability that if artist A is similar to artist B and artist C, B and

C are similar as well. Following [14] the clustering coeﬃcient of vertex i is the ratio

between the total number yi of the edges connecting its nearest neighbors and the total

number of all possible edges between all these nearest neighbors. ci can be calculated

following the expression (see [14] for details):

Finally, the clustering coeﬃcient C for the whole network is the average over the

number of nodes n:

random network, d is the average shortest path, and dr is the corresponding shortest path for the

random network. The last two columns correspond to the exponents of the power-law decay of the

degree distribution for the incoming and outgoing links, γin,γout, of the graphs (we show exponents

only when we found power-law decay).

IV. NETWORK STRUCTURE

A common feature appears in all networks under study, they have small-world properties

[14]. The average shortest path d (see Table I) of all graphs is below eight and always in

the same order of magnitude as the shortest path of a random graph with the same number

of nodes and links. This indicates that despite the high number of nodes (artists) and

the sparsity of the network, a user can always jump from a node to any other by a short

number of jumps (i.e. links). At the same time, the clustering coeﬃcient C, is several orders

of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding random network. Both ingredients,

the low shortest path and the high clustering, are the typical characteristics of small-world

networks

[14]. Small-worldness is an interesting property for recommendations systems,

since it has been suggested that humans ﬁnd it easy to navigate in small-world networks

using only local information [15, 16, 17].

Concerning the average degree hki, we observe that it has a low value, in three of them

(MSN, Amazon and AMG) but it is higher in Yahoo (hki=62.7). As we will discuss in the

6

following section, the output degree tends to be bounded due to the usability constraints,

i.e. the number of output links has to ﬁt on a web page length.

The cumulative degree distribution Pc(k) (distribution of nodes with a degree equal or

higher than k) and speciﬁcally the way that Pc(k) decreases allows to classify the small-world

networks [18]. With this aim, we have analyzed the Pc(k) distribution for all networks and

we have found diﬀerences that are related with the internal structure and probably the

construction mechanisms of each network.

Fig. 1 shows the cumulative degree distribution of the incoming (a) and outgoing (b)

links of the MSN recommendation network. It is worth noting the diﬀerence between both

distributions. The incoming degree distribution P in

c (k) refers to artists who are similar to a
c (k) is related with the number of links pointing to an artist and in a certain

selected artist. P in

sense, it is an indicator of the inﬂuence of that artist over the others or how prototypical it

is for a certain type of music. On other hand, P out

(k) refers to the number of output links

c

from a given artists. The number of outgoing connections displayed to the user is limited

for practical reasons since networks are on-line systems where recommendations are shown

on a web page, e.g., it would be useless and impractical to propose 2000 connections. This

fact truncates the tail of the P out

c

(k) distribution since not all the similar artists are linked

and reduces the expected value of kmax [19] for scale-free networks.

c (k) of MSN [see Fig.1(a)] has a power-law decay (P (k) ∼ k−γ), as indicated by the
P in
straight line in the log-log scale. Networks with a power law decay are called “scale-free” [20]

since we can not identify a single characteristic scale. This kind of structure is common in

small-world networks but not universal, and has been reported in diﬀerent complex networks,

such as the WWW [21], the network of protein interactions [22] or the telephone call graph

[23]. The P out

c

(k) distribution of MSN shows that the outgoing links are limited to twelve.

Furthermore the fact that P out

c

(k) drastically falls at k = 7 reveals that each artist has

typically six outgoing links. This limitation has very likely been introduced by the system

designers. It levels the outgoing links of all nodes of the network and rules out any possibility

of showing a power-law decay.

Fig. 1 also shows the Pc(k) of Amazon recommendation network. P in

c (k) [Fig.1(c)] is

quite similar to MSN, which indicates that both networks have similar structure, at least

for the incoming links. We ﬁnd again a power-law decay, which indicates that Amazon is

scale-free. On the contrary, we ﬁnd diﬀerences at P out

(k), which keeps the power-law decay.

In the left column, the cumulative distributions P in

distributions P out

This is not common on this kind of networks since it means that the outgoing links are not

as limited as MSN, in fact there are nodes with more than 100 outgoing links [see Fig.1(d)].

The absence of strong restrictions in the outgoing connections of Amazon network allows

both cumulative distributions (incoming/outgoing degree) to have similar shapes.

In Table I we have indicated the values of the power-law exponents γ of Fig. 1 (see [24]).

In all cases, γ is within the common range of values of previously studied scale-free networks

[4].

In Fig. 2 we have plot the cumulative degree distributions of AMG and Yahoo networks,

since both behave diﬀerent from the previous ones. P in

Finally, we observe how Yahoo shows some similarities with AMG network. Yahoo has

an exponential decay for intermediate degrees of the P in

it is lost for both low/high degrees. When looking at P out

c (k) distribution [Fig.2(c)], although
(k) [Fig.2(d)], we see that the

c

highest number of nodes is limited to 40. Furthermore, it exists a typical number of ∼ 30

outgoing links of each network, as we infer from the constant value (close to one) of P out

c

from k = 1 to k ∼ 30. A similar characteristic was shown at the P out

(k) of MSN network

c

[Fig.2(d)] (in that case, outgoing links where set to kout = 5).

V. DISCUSSION

Some conclusions are drawn from the analysis of the networks’ structure. Roughly speak-

ing, we can say that we observe two types of network, one with power law distribution of

P in

c (k) and the second with an exponential decay. Since all networks are supposed to have

9

the same functionality, i.e. recommendation of music based on artist similarities, it would be

expected that all of them have the same kind of structure, nevertheless MSN and Amazon

are scale-free while Yahoo and AMG are exponential.

The reason of the structural diﬀerences could be explained by taking into account the

ground characteristics of music networks together with their linking criteria. From the point

of view of network categories [4], music networks can be considered as an information (or

knowledge) network [25] with a high social component. The structure of citations between

academic papers is a classic example of an information network [26]. In this sense, when an

artist plays similar music to other artists, is somehow “citing” their music. At the same time,

a social component is unavoidable, since people are the elemental nodes of music networks.

In both cases, social and information networks, scale-free structure has been reported [4].

This structure is associated with the preference of new nodes to associate with nodes with

high degree, i.e. with a high number of links [20].

MSN and Amazon are user-ratings and user-habits based networks. In both cases, links

between artists are created by user ratings, buying behaviour or downloads statistics ob-

tained from thousands of users in what is known as “collaborative ﬁltering” [10]. In such

setups, each user inputs information on some of the nodes. Then all the information is

aggregated and combined with the aim of predicting future ratings or, as explained in [10],

to calculate the similarity between nodes. Of course, users have higher probabilities of link-

ing artists (by rating or downloading) that he/she likes. Since some artists are much more

popular than others, they will get more links. From the obtained results, we ﬁnd that this

kind of collaborative ﬁltering leads to scale-free structure, at least for the case of music

recommendation networks.

In order to check the hypothesis that popularity is behind the scale-free distribution, we

use user behaviour information from Art of the Mix [27]. Art of the Mix (AOMix) is a

website dedicated to sharing of playlists submitted by a community of users. It contains

almost 100,000 playlists contributed by thousands of users. Playlist information from AOMix

has been previously used by [5, 29] as a source for music artist similarity. The underlying

assumption considers that artists that co-occur in the same playlist are somehow similar.

This is the idea behind “people who bought X also bought Y” commonly found on on-line

retailers such as Amazon. The properties of the network constructed adding a link between

any two artists that coincide in a playlist are depicted in Table II. The cumulative degree

10

distribution of AOMix is displayed on Fig. 3 and shows a power-law decay as MSN and

Amazon. Art of the Mix is originally a bipartite graph composed of playlist and artists nodes

that has been projected into an artist nodes graph. It is worth mentioning that all networks

built with collaborative-ﬁltering algorithms derive from originally bipartite networks: e.g.:

People who listened to this X also listened Y or People who liked X also liked Y. The use of

what people do with or say about items, hence the exploitation of information of bipartite

graphs, is the basis of collaborative ﬁltering [10, 11, 25].

Concerning the exponential scaling of Yahoo and AMG, we have no information about the

wiring mechanisms of Yahoo (due to their privacy policy). Nevertheless, the AMG linking

criterion is explained in detail in [6]. This recommendation network is characterized by an

editorial group of “experts” which supervises the wiring of the network. In this case, the

construction of the network is uniquely guided by similarity criteria, a fact that can not be

guaranteed in the case of user-rating or user-behaviour derived networks.

In addition, it

could be expected that human experts are in fact truncating possible scale-free by ﬁltering

links between normal artists and “hub” artists [28].

Related with the exponential decay of Yahoo and AMG, it is worth commenting another

network used by [5, 29] in a pursue of a ground truth for music similarity. During a web

experiment, named MusicSeer, users where asked to select the most similar artist to a given

one from a list of 10 possibilities. The properties of this human supervised network, where

users have been explicitly asked to focus on similarity, is shown in Tab II and its degree

distribution is depicted in Fig. 3 (b). In this case, as for Yahoo and AMG, an exponential

degree distribution is obtained, and it is another example of how similarity music networks

which try to avoid user-preferences are prone to have exponential decay.

Both networks’ degree distributions, AOMix and MusicSeer, are drawn next to each other

to highlight how diﬀerences in the construction mechanisms aﬀect the degree distribution.

Exponential degree appears when similarity dominates over artist popularity otherwise we

observe power-law decays.

A crucial issue of the quality of recommendation networks is how searchable they networks

are, that is, how easy is it for a user to ﬁnd a target quickly. The inﬂuence of the network

structure on the navigation has been addressed in the literature [15, 16, 17, 30, 31, 32].

Strategies for search in scale-free networks using local information have been proposed

by [30, 31]. The algorithm selects the nodes with highest degree and scales sublinearly

with the number of nodes. This type of algorithm cannot be exploited in the networks

at hand. Firstly, the power law is found for the in-degree distribution only. As we men-

tioned above, the out-degree distribution has a cut due to web page usability constraints;

the recommendation should ﬁt on a web page. The in-degree distribution is unknown to

the users, so it is unlikely that they choose the above proposed algorithm when searching in

the recommendation networks. Secondly, it is unrealistic to think that users of the network

can adopt such a search strategy but rather the selection of nodes will be guided by their

intrinsic qualities or some sort of underlying distance [16, 17, 32]. Kleinsberg showed that

lattices with random long-range links connected according to a distance dependent probabil-

ity distribution are searchable [15]. Sublinear searches can be obtained assuming small-word

regime and the existence of an distance between nodes [17]. Given its importance on the

application, more work in this direction needs to be addressed. It will be very interesting to

gather and analyzed statistics of navigation of real users of the system.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the structure of music recommendation networks by means of complex

networks analysis. We have found small-world properties in all networks, which have an

inﬂuence on the navigation properties of the network. Despite sharing the small-world

structure, we have found diﬀerences in the scaling of their degree distribution. Networks with

user-preferences (from users of the network) as the linking criterion have a power-law decay

of their degree distribution, i.e. show scale-free properties. On the other hand, networks

constructed by similarity criteria, lead to an exponential decay of the degree distribution.

We believe that the scale-free and exponential decay could be related with the social or

information nature of the network. When the music recommendation network is constructed

under supervision of an editorial group, similarity aspects take advantage over the social ones

and this reﬂected in an exponential decay of the degree distribution. On the contrary, it is

reasonable to expect that the social nature of the recommendation network increases in case

of user-preferences linking. Finally, we give some insights about navigation through these

kind of networks and address future work towards this point.

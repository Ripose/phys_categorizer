Abstract

We warn of the potential nuclear proliferation’s consequences of military
applications of nano- or microgram amounts of antimatter, such as triggering
of high-yield thermonuclear explosions, laser pumping, compact sources of
energy, directed-energy beams, and portable sources of muons.

Sir — The ﬁrst published account of success in immobilizing antiprotons in an
electromagnetic trap has been the subject of a recent leading article News and
Views editorial [1]. Although this article gives a good overview of the scientiﬁc
meaning of this historical achievement, it gives in our view a rather misleading
perspective on its likely military signiﬁcance [2].

It is true that for some applications of antimatter, such as antiballistic missile
or spacecraft propulsion, relatively large amounts of antiprotons are required. For
most other cases, the useful amounts are usually much smaller. For example, we
have calculated that less than a microgram of antiprotons is sufﬁcient to trigger a
thermonuclear explosion or pump a powerful X-ray laser [3, 4].

But antimatter is not only the most powerful of all high-explosives, it is also the
only feasible portable source of muons. In every antiproton annihilation, on the
average three muons are produced. These could be used to induce muon-catalysed
fusion reactions in a deuterium-helium-3 mixture, an attractive solution for a low-
weight neutron-free space nuclear reactor that could be operated in a continuous
or pulsed mode.

Furthermore, by collecting and cooling the muons (a relatively easy task com-
pared with that of cooling antiprotons [5]) a very intense beam could be formed

and sent into the atmosphere to guide, over a range of more than 10 km, a series of
powerful electron or proton beam pulses towards a target. More simply, stopping
the muons in a suitable material would generate an extraordinarily effective X-ray
lasing medium, for the two microseconds lifetime of the muonic-atoms.

In outer space, a very low intensity burst of antiprotons would be most suitable
for active warhead/decoy discrimination. In this and the two previous examples,
the needed amount of antiprotons is of the order of nanograms per engagement.
Conservative estimates of the technical problems involved in producing and ma-
nipulating microgram amounts of antimatter per day, show that known technology
is only a couple of orders of magnitudes away from meeting the challenge [4, 6, 7].

We are very much concerned by the implications for nuclear weapons prolifera-
tion of the undisputable scientiﬁc feasibility of several antimatter weapon concepts.
To develop such weapons would add considerable impetus to the current arms race.
We call for an immediate ban on all antimatter related research, especially since
this work is fundamental to many fourth-generation nuclear weapon systems.

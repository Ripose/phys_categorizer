We introduce an energy dissipation model for traﬃc ﬂow based on the optimal velocity

model (OV model). In this model, vehicles are deﬁned as moving under the rule of the OV

model, and energy dissipation rate is deﬁned as the product of the velocity of a vehicle and

resistant force which works to it. According to the results of numerical simulation on periodic

boundary condition, the energy dissipation depends on traﬃc conditions, such as congestion

(traﬃc jam), and therefore depends on parameters and initial conditions of the system. The

results of simulation indicate that, although the ﬂux of vehicles is not so diﬀerent between

at a state of free ﬂow and that of congestion, the energy dissipation reveals a burst at a state

of congestion. Additionally, how burst behaves depends on how congestion appears.

Introduction

Full Paper

A lot of researches have been done on traﬃc ﬂow model since 1950s when traﬃc systems

were developing in the real world. From the viewpoint of statistical physics, lots of traﬃc
ﬂow models were proposed1, 2). The optimal velocity model (OV model)3, 4) and the cellular
automata model (CA model)5) are examples of micro models, and ﬂuid model is an example
of macro models6, 7).

In the previous researches of traﬃc ﬂow, one of the main questions is how traﬃc congestion

(traﬃc jam) occurs and whether it is stable or not. In the research of OV model for example,

the method of linearizing analysis is applied and the conclusion is that congestion is understood

as some kind of phase transition of a system and its stability depends on parameters as well

as initial and boundary conditions. It means that, at least in the conventional OV model,

congestion is intrinsic phenomenon of a system and can appears without external forcing like

bottleneck of road.

In the previous studies, many works were done on vehicle’s ﬂux of spatial transportation

and stability of state, but almost none on energy dissipation. Originally, research of traﬃc

ﬂow has much relation to social issues like energy problems, so we think it is important to

consider the energy dissipation in modelling the traﬃc ﬂow.

In the viewpoint of engineering, the reseaches of one vehicle, including measurement of

fuel eﬃciency, have been done by many groups in automobile industry. But there are few

discussions of fuel eﬃciency of the total system of vehicles or their energy dissipation because

the whole system is too large to measure in the real world. So it is important to estimate what

happens in the real traﬃc by modelling the whole traﬃc systems and calculating the energy

dissipation of them.

We would like to understand physical feature of energy dissipation of traﬃc ﬂow but it

is not obvious from equation of motion of traﬃc ﬂow model. So we have to make a new

modelling of energy dissipation combining with a former model of vehicle’s motion. We use

the OV model to combine with our energy dissipation model. The OV model is simple but

describes well the appearance of congestion cluster in the system, thus it suits our energy

dissipation model. Although it has been pointed that the OV model has some problems by
comparison with empirical data, we use this model in this paper8).

In the following, we ﬁrst discribe the OV model on which we base (Sec.2.1) and then

propose an energy dissipation model (Sec.2.2). Next, we show a result of numerical simulation

(Sec.3) and do some discussion about results (Sec.4). Finally we give summary (Sec.5).

2. Models

2.1 Optimal velocity model

The optimal velocity model (OV model) was proposed by Bando et al. in 1995 and it has
been used and modiﬁed by many researchers in various ways until today3, 4, 8). The OV model

is one of micro models and it deﬁnes the dynamical equation of motion for each vehicle in one

dimensional space. The equation of motion is given as

where

dt2 xn(t) = a

(cid:20)

V (∆xn(t)) −

d
dt

xn(t)
(cid:21)

,

∆xn(t) = xn+1(t) − xn(t)

for each vehicle number n(n = 1, 2, ..., N ). N is the total number of vehicles, xn is the co-

ordinate of the nth vehicle and is a function of time t, ∆xn is its forward distance to the

preceding (n + 1)th vehicle, and a is a parameter called sensitivity which represents driver’s

response speed. We assume that ∆xn should be positive. The most important feature of this

model is assuming the “optimal velocity” function V (∆xn). The OV function is a function

of the forward distance ∆xn of vehicle number n, and having the properties: (i) a monotoni-

cally increasing function, (ii) |V (∆xn)| has lower and upper limit. The upper limit of the OV

function corresponds to vmax = V (∆xn → ∞). We adopt a functional form of V (∆xn) as

V (∆xn) =

∆xn − c

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

+ tanh

(cid:18)

w (cid:19)(cid:21)

,

which satisﬁes the properties (i) and (ii). Parametes c, d, and w control the shape of OV

function: c corresponds to the ∆x of inﬂection point of OV function representing the forward

distance in which the sign of increasing rate of vehicle’s optimal velocity changes; d represents

the forward distance where optimal velocity of vehicle becomes zero; and w determines the

slope of OV function. They all have dimensions of length. Fig. 1 shows the shape of V (∆x).

2.2 Modelling the energy dissipation

Full Paper

Now, we introduce our energy dissipation model. Vehicles move in resistant forces like air

drug, friction between road and tires, and so on. Conversely speaking, vehicles do work to

external environment. These works will ﬁnally be converted to heat and dissipate in the air.

That brings transport of energy from vehicles to the air. Therefore we deﬁne energy dissipation

rate of each vehicle jq as the product of vehicle’s velocity v and the total resistant force Fr

which work to each vehicle:

jq = Frv.

In this model, thermal eﬃciency of engine is not taken into account. Whether this treatment

is appropriate or not is such an important problem that we shall discuss it later. Then we

have to model the resistant force Fr working to each vehicle to consider energy dissipation

as a function of the state of a vehicle. We assume that Fr consists of three parts, deﬁned as

follow:

Fr = Fa + Ff + Fb

= (αv + βv2) + f + Fb.

Fa(= αv + βv2) is the air drug which is a function of the velocity of vehicle v. Ff contains
other frictions working to vehicle, which we assume being constant f . Fb is the braking force

which only appears when vehicle reduces its speed.

The problem here is how to deﬁne the functional form of Fb for eq. (5) where we have a

freedom of choice. To solve this problem, we consider the Newton’s equation of motion of a

vehicle. We deﬁne Fe as the force created by engine to move a vehicle ahead, then Newton’s

equation of motion of a vehicle may be written as

M

= Fe − Fr

dv
dt

where signs of Fr is deﬁned as positive when its direction is opposite to vehicle’s moving

direction, while that of Fe being positive when its direction is equal to vehicle’s moving

direction. M is the mass of the vehicle considered. Considering the OV model and eqs. (1)

and (5), the following equation is derived:

M a[V (∆x) − v] = Fe − Fb − (αv + βv2) − f.

When a vehicle is accelerating or moving with constant speed, the value of Fb must be zero

and the functional form of Fe is derived from eq. (7). But Fb is not zero when a vehicle is

deccelerating, and the functional form of Fe − Fb is derived as

Fe − Fb = (αv + βv2) + f + M a[V (∆x) − v].

We have to separate Fe and Fb to model Fe and Fb indivisually because we need a functional

form of Fb. Thus we set two types of assumption to separate them as;

for model type 1, and

Fb = −M a[V (∆x) − v]

Fe = (αv + βv2) + f

Fb = −(αv + βv2) − M a[V (∆x) − v]

Fe = f

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

for model type 2. Type 1 means that when a vehicle is reducing its speed, the braking force Fb

is used for deccelerating and the driving force Fe is for air drug and frictions. Type 2 means

that air drug is also used for deccelerating and Fe is just for frictions. So to speak, type 1 and

2 represent possible maximum and minimum power of engine respectively when a vehicle is
decelerating. Finally the total resistant force of nth vehicle F (n)
as follow depending on the sign of vehicle’s acceleration and the type of Fb,

is determined in three cases

r

(when accelarating or moving with constant speed)

F (n)

r =Fa + Ff

(when decelerating by Fb of type 1)

F (n)

r =Fa + Ff + Fb

n) + fn − Mna[V (∆xn) − vn]

(14)

=fn − Mna[V (∆xn) − vn].

(15)

Mn, vn and fn are the mass, the velocity and the constant friction of the nth vehicle respec-

tively. According to eq. (11), Fb of type 2 can be negative when the vehicle decelerates if
(αv + βv2) > −M a[V (∆x) − v]. Therefore we supplement to the model one additional rule

that Fb is replaced with zero if Fb < 0.

We numerically solve the diﬀerential equation (1), and caluculate the energy dissipation

rate for each vehicle and the total system using eqs. (16) and (17). We then integrate numer-

ically the energy dissipation rate with respect to time for getting the total dissipated energy

E during all the simulation time T . Then the time average of Jq is obtained as

(time average of Jq) = hJqi =

where hJqi has dimension of energy per unit time. In addition to the energy dissipation rate

of system hJqi, we would also like another coeﬃcient which has dimension of energy per unit

length to represent energy eﬃciency of vehicular transportation of system, so that we deﬁne

e which is the time average energy eﬃciency of one vehicle in system as

and the dependence of

hJqi and e on parameters.

3.1.2 Simulation conditions

We set a periodic boundary condition, in which vehicles move around circuit of length

L and (N + 1)th vehicle is identical to the ﬁrst one. Furthermore, circuit is regarded as one

dimentional and has no passing of vehicles. To avoid passing, sensitivity a is set larger than

0.8(1/s) throughout all simulations. We usually set the initial condition of coordinates and

velocities of vehicles as

∆xn(0) = xn+1(0) − xn(0) = L/N

vn(0) = V (L/N ),

while we impose ﬂuctuations of initial coordinates in some cases.

In this paper, we consider that number of vehicles N and sensitivity a are the parameters

which can be varied and other parameters are ﬁxed on constant value. Fixed parameters are

given simply and semi-realistically: (parameters of OV function) c = 35 m, d = 4 m, w = 10 m;
(parameters of energy dissipation model) α = 0, β = 1.12 kg m−1, Mn = 1800 kg, fn = µMng,
µ = 0.01(friction coeﬃcient), g = 9.8 m s−2(gravitational acceleration); L = 5000 m (circuit
length)9, 10). Using these parameters, we estimate the order of magnitude of each resistant

force as

Fa = (αv + βv2) ≃ 1000 N

Ff = f ≃ 180 N

Fb = −M a [V (∆x) − v] ≃ 18000 N,

(22)

(23)

(24)

where we set v = 30 m s−1 (maximum speed), a = 1.0 s−1 and V (∆x) = 20 m s−1. The
braking force here is that of model type 1. This estimation shows that the braking force is

much higher than air drug and constant friction.

3.2 Results

At ﬁrst, we use eq. (14) for resistant force and calculating energy dissipation rate. We
performed a series of simulations of OV model and the calculated energy dissipation rate j(1)
for a typical vehicle in a typical situation in Fig. 2. Table I is a list of some macroscopic

q

values corresponding to Fig. 2(a)-(d). The left side of Fig. 2(a)-(d) are plots of positions of

all vehicles(N = 120) on the circuit length L with time development (xn, t), where the line

which goes upper right in each ﬁgure is the trajectory of vehicle number one (x1, t). The time

duration T is ﬁxed as 1000 s throughout the simulations because any important event has

q which correspond respectively

already happened while the end of this period in almost all cases. The right side of Fig. 2(a)-
(d) respectively are diagrams of time development of v1 and j(1)
to the velocity and energy dissipation rate of the vehicle number one in the left ﬁgures. Fig.
2(a)-(d) are diﬀerent in the initial positions xn(0) and sensitivity a. Fig. 2(a) (a = 2.0 s−1) is
the result with no ﬂuctuation in initial condition given as eq. (20) and no congestion appears
in it. Fig. 2(b) (a = 1.0 s−1) is the result withe x100(0) being deviated by −20 m and there
appears one congestion. In Fig. 2(c) (a = 1.0 s−1), x20(0), x60(0) and x100(0) have deviations
of −20 m and there appears three congestions. Fig. 2(d) (a = 1.0 s−1) shows an example for
which all xn(0) have perturbations given randomly between −L/2N and +L/2N , and there

appears many congestions. In the right side of Fig. 2(a), there appears constant velocity and

energy dissipation rate with no ﬂuctuations. On the other hand we see ﬂuctuations of those

in the right side of Fig. 2(b)-(d). The energy dissipation rate shows “spike”-like shape and

large magnitude when the vehicle diminishes its speed. We call this eﬀect “energy dissipation

spike” of a vehicle. These ﬂuctuations are due to the appearance of congestions. These results

may be summarized that the more congestion clusters appear in the system, the shorter the

period of ﬂuctuation becomes.

of ﬂux of vehiclar transportation Q and (c) that of energy eﬃciency of one vhicle e versus

the total number of vehicles N in circuit, with ensemble-averaging of the initial coordinates

of vehicles where xn(0) has random ﬂuctuation between −L/2N and L/2N . It shows large

increase in energy dissipation rate hJqi and energy eﬃciency e, as well as two branches of

vehicular ﬂux Q in the middle region of N . We call this eﬀect “energy dissipation burst” of

vehicular system. This eﬀect represents that the system need much higher energy dissipation

because of the appearing of congestion clusters beside the system maintains its ﬂux of vehicular

transportation eﬀectively the same. It can be recognized that congestion occurs only in this

middle region, and there exist low and high density steady state ﬂow, which means density

of the system and the velocity of every vehicle are constant, in the left and right side of the

region. Fig. 3(c) shows that the steady state ﬂow with high density of vehicles brings more

eﬃcient energy dissipation for transporting vehicles than the ﬂow with low density. However

Fig. 3(b) shows this region corresponds to much lower in transportation rate.

Fig. 4 is a diagram which shows behavior of hJqi and e as a function of N and a. In

the ﬁgures, it seems that the width of middle region of N , which corresponds to the energy

dissipation burst region, is wider when a is smaller. And the burst disappears in the region of

large a, where no congestion occurs. The values of energy dissipation rate and energy eﬃciency

are not constant but show “mountain” like shape inside the burst region.

Another series of simulation like above have been done using eq. (15) for resistant force.

The resuts shows almost the same value and shape, and it is shown in Fig. 3 as an example.

4. Discussion

We ﬁrst discuss the implication of Fig. 2. According to Bando et al.3, 4), it depends on OV

function and sensitivity a whether congestion clusters appear or not. However it depends on

initial condition of vehicles how congestions appear, in particular the number of simultaneous

congestions. Energy dissipation rate of a vehicle shows spike when a vehicle reduce its speed

and consequently that of whole system with congestions shows burst. These eﬀects mean

that the energy dissipation by braking force is much more responsible for the total energy

dissipation than by air drug and frictions despite on account of relativly short duration of

appearing Fb in eqs. (14) and (15). It owes to the fact that Fb is larger in the order of

magnitude compared to other resistant forces as shown in eqs. (22), (23) and (24). The same

reason applies the fact that simulations with eq. (14) give almost the same results as that

with eq. (15). We wonder that the magnitude of burst would be too large so that we tried
to do some verifying simulations with unrealistically large air drug (α = 0, β = 11.2 kg m−1)
and large friction coeﬃcient (µ = 0.1). They also show the energy dissipation spike and burst

though thier values become small. According to Table I and above discussion, we can say that

energy dissipation burst is the feature of vehicular system with congestions: the less congestion

clusters appear, the less the total energy dissipation becomes.

Although the results of simulations appearing in Table I and in Fig. 3 indicate that the

ﬂux of vehicles is not so diﬀerent between at the state of congestion and the state of steady

ﬂow and relatively independent of the number of congestions, the energy dissipation rate

becomes much higher at the state of congestion than the state of steady ﬂow. Fig. 5 shows all

vehicle’s behavior in the phase space of the forward distance and velocity (∆x, v) with time

development on the state of congestions. It shows a hysterisis loop around OV function. This

closed curve has two cusp point: the upper one shows large ∆x and v which means vehicles

are outside of congestion and the lower one shows small ∆x and v which means inside of

congestion. When vehicles are leaving or entering congestion, they move counterclockwise on

this loop. According to ref. 4, vehicles always follow this loop as long as sensitivity a and OV

function V (∆x) are unchanged. From this story and Fig. 5(b) we recognize that vehicles show

almost the same behavior along this loop when they enter any congestions and reveal almost

the same magnitude of energy dissipation burst because of eqs. (9) and (11). We can say

that the energy dissipation rate hjqi and hJqi are in proportion to the incidence of congestion

clusters because they trace this loop faithfully whether the number of appearing clusters is

much or less. It corresponds to the results of numerical calculation of energy dissipation in

Table I. Fig. 6 additionally shows that the energy eﬃciency of one vehicle e is also in proportion

to number of clusters beside the average ﬂux of vehicular transportation Q keeps its value

almost constant. Furthermore, Fig. 4 shows that congention and energy dissipation burst do

not appear if sensitivity a of OV model is large enough.

According to the above discussions, we may conclude that we can reduce the total energy

dissipation of each vehicle and therefore of entire system in two ways. First, the sensitivity

a would be large enough so that not produce congestion as well as the resulting energy

dissipation burst. Second, when a is not large enough, we can reduce energy dissipation if

we can control the incidence of congestion clusters through controlling the initial positions of

vehicles or by some other means. In other words, when the traﬃc is crowded in the real traﬃc

expressway, you may be able to reduce energy waste without reducing transportation rate if

you stop traﬃc ﬂow at somewhere intentionally and make one big congestion.

But there still remains some questions. First, one might think that we should consider

the thermal eﬃciency of the engine of a vehicle in our model because energy dissipation

from the engine itself must occur when it works. In a real vehicle, the energy dissipation

from engine may show higher rate than that considered in our model because the maximum
thermal eﬃciency of normal vehicular gasoline engine reaches just 28-33%10 ). It will not bring

an essential diﬃcalty if the thermal eﬃciency shows constant value regardless of the state of

vehicle, we can calcurate entire energy dissipation from our simulation results by multiplying

the inverse of thermal eﬃciency. However, it might cause a qualitatively diﬀerent results if the

thermal eﬃciency depends on the state of vehicle and our simulation results may be changed.

One thing can be mentioned here that thermal eﬃciency has upper limit, which means energy

dissipation can be increased by the state of vehicles but never decreased because of variation

of thermal eﬃciency. Therefore the feature of energy dissipation burst will not be changed

even if a model contains the variation of the thermal eﬃciency explicitly.

There are also some problems on using models and simulation conditions. In this paper, we

solve the OV model numerically with periodic boundary conditions and calculate the energy

dissipation with a lot of parameters ﬁxed. The sequence of moving vehicles is deterministic as

long as we use the conventional OV model because it is described in the form of diﬀerential

equations, while a real traﬃc may contain some kind of noise inside the system. This eﬀect

may suppress the burst science the proper inclusion of noise to the traﬃc system may prevent

appearing of congestion and consequently the energy dissipation burst. Although the doubt is

not dispelled completely, it can be said that the noise-induced acceleration and deceleration

of vehicles would increase energy dissipation because of larger frequency of energy dissipation

spikes. Conversely speaking, we can reduce energy waste if we drive obediently under the rule

of the OV model without time lags in the real world.

There is also a problem of deﬁning appropriate ensemble for averaging simulation condi-

tions. The value and shape of diagrams in Fig. 4 might be changed if we put diﬀerent ensemble

though the feature of burst being unchanged. Therefore we have to consider how to set the

ensemble of simulation condition to show that the results of our simulation is universal in

the OV model and applicable to the real world. There is also a remaining question why the

rightside of Fig. 2 shows ﬂuctuations of the peak of hjqi, which may be due to the method of

simulation but is not sure for now.

For further studies, we should improve our simulation especially on how to control param-

eters and simulation conditions. Stochastically distributive parameters and open boundary

conditions should be considerd. We also have to improve our energy dissipation model in

paticular the modelling of resistant forces. It is also interesting to combine our energy dis-

sipation model to some other models, for example the coupled map optimal velocity model
(CMOV model) with random noise on velocity of vehicles8).

5. Summary

We presented an energy dissipation model for traﬃc ﬂow based on the one dimentional

optimal velocity model (OV model). Being simple and well describing the appearance of

congestion cluster in the system, the OV model is well suited model to introduce energy

dissipation. In our model, the energy dissipation of the whole traﬃc system is calculated

through modelling the resistant forces which work to each vehicle. We found that the energy

dissipation rate of each vehicle shows spike due to decceleration when entering congestions,

and its behavior in the phase space is almost always the same. Thus the energy dissipation

spike is the characteristic eﬀect of one vehicle, and the energy dissipation of total system

consequently shows burst when congestions appear. It is a feature of the whole vehicular

system. The energy dissipation rate is in proportion to the incidence of congestion clusters.

This implies that we can reduce energy dissipation of the traﬃc system with preserving ﬂux

of vehicular transportation if we can control the number of traﬃc congestions contained in

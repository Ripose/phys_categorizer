The Stock Price Distribution in Quantum Finance

Martin Schaden†
New York University, 4 Washington Place, New York, New York 10003

Abstract

A simple quantum model can explain the L´evy-unstable distributions
for individual stock returns found in ref.[1]. The tails of the short-term
cumulative distribution for the logarithmic return, x, scale as |x|−3, if the
”decay rate” of a stock, γ(q), for large |q| is proportional to |q|, q being
the Fourier-conjugate variable to x. On a time scale of a few days or less,
the distribution of the quantum model is shape stable and scales with
a single parameter, its variance. The observed cumulative distribution
for the short-term normalized returns is quantitatively reproduced over
7 orders of magnitude without any free parameters. The distribution of
returns ultimately converges to a Gaussian one for large time periods
if γ(q ∼ 0) ∝ q2. The empirical constraints suggest the ansatz γ(q) =
m2 + q2, which reproduces the positive part of the observed average

1 Introduction

The quest for a quantitative statistical description of stock price changes began
more than a century ago with Bachelier’s thesis2 that the price movements are
a random walk. Although Bachelier’s random walk has since been modiﬁed,
the eﬀort to model stock price movements by a stochastic process continues.

The computerized historic ﬁnancial records make a high precision statis-
tical analysis of the short-term returns possible. It is increasingly diﬃcult to
reconcile Bachelier’s conjecture with this new wealth of information on time
scales that are less than a few weeks.

To estimate the probability density function (pdf), pi(x; T ), for the ”re-

turn”, x, (the change in the logarithm of the price Si))

x := ln[Si(t + T )/Si(t)] = ln[Si(t + T )]

average. Reducing the time horizon to minutes oﬀers the additional advantage
of reducing the inﬂuence of changing macro-economic conditions.

The shortest time horizon investigated is T = 5 min and the analysis1 fol-
lows the stocks of the 1000 US companies with the largest market capitalization
over the 2-year period from January 1994 to December 1995. The result for
the cumulative probabilities of the normalized 5-minute returns (averaged over
all 1000 stocks) is reproduced in the log-log plot of Fig. 1. Also shown is the
average cumulative distribution found for the normalized daily returns. The
latter were obtained from the records of stock prices of about 16000 individual
companies over the 35-year period1 1962-96. Although the time scales diﬀer by
1 tradingday/5 min and involve a diﬀerent base of compa-
a factor of
nies, no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two sets of normalized
data is observed.

Apart from this remarkable scaling over vastly diﬀerent time scales and
many diﬀerent companies, the most interesting feature of the empirical (aver-
age) cumulative distribution is its pronounced power law behavior over

The exponent α is found to be close to 3. For T = 5 min, the best estimate for
α is 3.10
0.12 for the negative tail of the
empirical distribution1. For short time intervals T < 1 week the distribution is
only slightly skewed, but the eﬀect is found to become more pronounced with
increasing T . The observed skewness of the distribution could be caused by
a number of factors that all tend to distort its negative tail, such as the dis-
creteness of prices, bankruptcy regulations, etc.. We do not model such eﬀects
and for the purpose of this investigation replace the empirical distribution by
a symmetric one with the same positive part.

The empirical estimates of the power law exponent are well outside the re-
gion for L´evy-stable distributions, which would require3 that 0 < α
2. [The
observed power law thus refutes Bachelier’s conjecture, because the correspond-
ing distribution cannot be the result of a Markov process, i.e. a generalized
random walk. The probability density function (pdf) for T = 390 min
1 day
would otherwise have to diﬀer considerably in shape from the T = 5 min one,
since the 390/5 = 78-fold convolution of the latter is not shape-similar to itself,
since it is not a L`evy-stable distribution.] The power law tails could be due to

processes4. However, such stochastic processes generally depend on various,
quite unrelated, parameters, whereas most of the statistical information par-
ticular to any given stock is expressed by the average and the variance of its
return1. Stochastic processes furthermore do not prefer an exponent α

though power law tails with similar exponents have also been observed for the
cumulative distributions of market indices-5 as well as for commodity prices6.

2 Power Law Tails with α = 3 in Quantum Finance

The recently proposed quantum description of ﬁnancial markets7 oﬀers a sur-
prisingly simple and transparent explanation for the observed distributions. In
this framework it in particular is natural to ﬁnd that the tails of the cumula-
tive probability of short-term returns fall oﬀ as a power law with the exponent
α = 3.

of the pdf of a stock’s return. The essence of a quantum description is that this
pdf is interpreted as the square of the absolute value of an amplitude φ(x; T ),

If the temporal evolution (and thus the pdf) is invariant under the trans-
formation a x

Since the probability of zero return, p(0; T ), does not vanish, φ(x; T ) in this
case is symmetric and a function of x2 only. The asymptotic behavior of the
pdf p(x; T ) in Eq. (5) implies,

on the real axis and falls oﬀ like a power law for large values of x, we will
model it by a meromorphic function. The position and strength of the poles
in the complex plane then constitute the set of parameters describing the pdf
of the individual stock. The simplestb symmetric amplitude satisfying Eq. (7)
(a + ib) (the

real parameters a and b > 0 generally will depend on T ). One is thus led to

The two real parameters a and b on which it depends, can be related to the
variance of the distribution and its curvature at the origin. The variance of
the pdf of Eq. (10) is the square of the distance of the complex poles from the
origin,

The second (independent) parameter on which the pdf depends is the ratio
r = a/b, or, equivalently, the phase of z. The curvature of the pdf at x = 0 is,

In Fig. 1, the normalized cumulative distributions for ratios r = 0, 1, 3 are
shown together with the empirical data. Apart from an overall change in the
normalization of the tails, r changes the distribution qualitatively near g = 0.
The empirical data for individual stocks prefers small r < 1 and is consistent
with r = 0, i.e. with an amplitude whose poles are on or close to the imaginary
axis.

3 Quantum Stability

The good description of the empirical data by an ansatz for the pdf that is the
square of the absolute value of a meromorphic amplitude could be considered
fortuitous and in itself does not point to a quantum model. But the apparent
stability of the shape of this distribution over relatively long times does.

Quantum dynamics primarily describes the temporal evolution of the am-
plitude – the evolution of the corresponding pdf follows by Eq. (6) and is highly
non-linear. Whereas stochastic processes that give L´evy-unstable distributions
of the type Eq. (10) with the correct power law tails tend to be contrived, the
ansatz for the amplitude turns out to be absolutely stable under a relatively
simple and quite natural quantum dynamics.

To see this, consider the Fourier-transform of the amplitude of Eq. (8) with
the normalization Eq. (9). the contour integration about the simple poles of
the ansatz at
(a + ib) is elementary and gives the Fourier-transform
φ(q; T ),

z =

Z

For very short times, when the variance of the distribution, and thus a as well
as b are very small, ˜φ(q) essentially is constant over a wide range of q.
In
this case the corresponding amplitude Eq. (8) for the return is well localized
about x = 0, i.e. the initial price. The variance of the pdf grows with the

6

time horizon, but the normalized cumulative distribution remains the same if
the parameters a and b grow proportionally and the ratio r = (a/b) does not
depend on T .

In a quantum model, the temporal evolution of a state

where the symbol T denotes time ordering of the exponential factors (redun-

commute). To conserve probability in a complete Hilbert space, ˆHeﬀ (t) nec-
essarily would have to be hermitian and the state would evolve by a unitary
rotation. However, ˆHeﬀ(t) generally is not hermitian, if it describes the evolu-
tion within a subspace of the complete Hilbert-space, such as that spanned by
a single stock.

Comparing Eq. (16) with Eq. (15) suggests that the eﬀective Hamiltonian

γ(q) are both proportional to the magnitude of its wave-number q. If r = a/b
is constant, one can interpret b(T ) as proportional to the ”proper” time of a
stock, i.e. as the monotonically increasing parameter that characterizes the
evolution of the stock’s price distribution. b(T ) need not be proportional to
physical time or even to trading time (except perhaps for very long time scales).
The proper time of a stock could be some monotonically increasing quantity
that is even more relevant to the dynamics than a properly deﬁned trading
time, such as the overall number of trades, number of traded shares or similar.
2πb(T ) in the
amplitude
φ(q; T ) of Eq. (15) ensures that the pdf remains normalized to 1

given stock is again traded (for any price) after a time T , is the normalization

particle’s momentum or position if it is observed intact at time T .]

4 Ultimate Convergence to a Gaussian Fixed Point

The pdf would not be shape-stable in the quantum interpretation, if the expo-
nential in Eq. (15) were for instance multiplied by a polynomial in q, that is, if
the amplitude φ(x; T ) asymptotically behaved as a power law fall oﬀ with an
exponent other than 2. The exponent α
3 and the apparent stability of the
distribution thus are naturally linked by the fact that the stability in a quantum
model primarily concerns the evolution of the amplitude.
[In quantum the-
ory, a Kolmogorov-like convolution equation is satisﬁed by the Green-function
G(x, t; y, t′) rather than by the transition probability P (x, t; y, t′).] Although
the evolution of an amplitude of Lorentz type such as the one in Eq. (8) is
stable, there are of course other ﬁxed points. Of great interest is the Gaussian
one, because one does expect the pdf to eventually approach a Gaussian distri-
bution. Note that the Fourier-transform of a Gaussian amplitude is Gaussian
and that a Gaussian amplitude implies a Gaussian pdf.

∼

∼

The pdf p(x; T ) of individual stocks empirically1 begins to resemble a
Gaussian distribution only after several years. The results of the analysis1
for T = 16 days to T = 1024 days
4 tradingyears are shown in Fig. 2. The
slow rate of convergence to a Gaussian ﬁxed point suggests that it may be due
to macro-economic- and other factors such as stock splits, buy-backs, etc. that
are irrelevant for the short-term dynamics of a stock. Note that the positive
and negative tails of the cumulative distribution do not approach a Gaussian
at the same rate1. Although the replacement by a symmetric distribution thus
becomes questionable for long time scales, it nevertheless should be possible
to consistently describe the crossover from one (almost) ﬁxed point to another
within a single eﬀective quantum model. For simplicity and because it is a
ﬁxed point and consistent with the short-term data, we consider only the case
a = 0, i.e. a stock whose evolution is completely dominated by its ”decay rate”
γ(q).

cConceptually it would be more appropriate to include a factor 2πb in the relation Eq. (6)
between the conditional probability density and the square of the amplitude, instead of
normalizing the amplitude itself.

As Fig. 2 shows, the extended ansatz with a = 0 qualitatively and to some
extent even quantitatively reproduces the observed positive tails of the (aver-
age) normalized cumulative distributions of ref.[1]. The distributions for time
periods of T = 16, 64, 256 and T = 1024 trading days correspond to values of
the parameter s = 0.04, 0.16, 0.64 and s = 2.56. The approach to a Gaussian
ﬁxed point of the negative tails is much slower1. The fact that we are approx-
imating skewed distributions by symmetric ones may partly explain some of
the quantitative discrepancies visible in Fig. 2. Systematic deviations would
also arise due to less than perfect scaling of the individual stock distributions
for large T . The ”lightest” stocks (the ones with the smallest m) in this case
would begin to dominate the average of Eq. (3) at large normalized returns.
The ﬂattening out of the tails of the averaged cumulative distributions for
T > 16 days in this case could be understood as due to some ”lighter than
average” stocks.

The overall quality of this one-parameter ﬁt down to observed cumulative
probabilities of 10−5 nevertheless is rather encouraging. The parameter val-
ues of s that best ﬁt the individual distributions furthermore are proportional

10

to the trading time T , suggesting that the eﬀective Hamiltonian may be ap-
proximately time independent for suﬃciently long time intervals. One would
hope that this is true for any parameterization of the evolution, since most
monotonically increasing quantities that could be relevant for the evolution of
a stock’s price eventually do increase proportional to physical- (and trading-)
time.

5 Summary

∼

The power law tails of the cumulative distribution for short-term returns with
an exponent α
3 observed in ref.[1] are accurately modelled by pdf’s of the
form Eq. (10). These distributions can be understood and are naturally stable
in the framework of a quantum model of ﬁnance. The essential diﬀerence to
a stochastic process, is that a quantum model is primarily concerned with
the evolution of the amplitude, rather than directly with the evolution of the
probability density itself. A Lorentzian amplitude falls oﬀ as a power law with
exponent 2 and is shape-stable in its (quantum) evolution. This ansatz for
the amplitude corresponds to stocks that behave as ”free” quantum particles
with a decay rate γ(q) that is proportional to their wave-number
and with
a negligible frequency ω(q)
γ(q). The pdf of Eq. (10) corresponding to such
an amplitude quantitatively reproduces the average cumulative distribution
observed for normalized 5 minute and daily returns over 7 orders of magnitude
with no free parameters.

q
|

≪

|

The convergence to a Gaussian pdf over time horizons of several months
to years can be ensured by modifying γ(q) to a function with quadratic depen-
dence on q near q = 0. Neglecting any frequency dependence, the observed cu-
mulative distributions for the normalized returns1 are qualitatively reproduced
down to a cumulative probability of 10−4 for time periods up to 4 trading
years. As discussed before, the deterioration in the quality of the ﬁt to the
long-term distributions could partly be attributable to their skewness, which
is more severe for longer time intervals. It may also be due to some ”lighter
than average” stocks, which would begin to dominate the average of Eq. (3)
for high normalized returns, if the scaling of the individual stock distributions
for T > 16 days is less than perfect.

The proposed quantum model for stock price ﬂuctuations gives a surpris-
ingly quantitative and transparent explanation of the observed power law tails
in the short-term cumulative probability for individual stock returns. The
exponent α = 3 in this case is not be accidental and corresponds to a sta-
ble and simple quantum evolution. The advantage of this description over a
stochastic one could be that it provides for a minimal but consistent set of

11

(auto-)correlations without simulating a vast number of hidden and not so
hidden factors. The implications of this approach to ﬁnancial markets can be
further tested by considering portfolios of stocks and stock indices. It is en-
couraging that these empirically5 also tend to have relatively stable power law
tails with exponents that are rather close to α = 3. However, the distributions
for such composite instruments are richer even for short time horizons and
cannot (and should not) be quantitatively reproduced by the simple functions
that appear to describe the price distributions of individual stocks so well.

ematics department of the Courant Institute of New York University for their
hospitality and for organizing the very informative and accessible seminar in
mathematical ﬁnance, where I became aware of the empirical analysis discussed
here. I am very much indebted to Larry Spruch for his personal support.

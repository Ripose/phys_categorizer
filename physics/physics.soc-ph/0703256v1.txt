We present a model of interpersonal comparisons appearing as a generalization of a multi-state
model for elements with internal bias. This model was done following a previous work, where agents
with dissatisfaction compare them in between. The internal bias are the preferences pre-assigned
to each agent, and the states are represented by the visual contacts an agent makes to the baskets
of her neighbors. The topology of the comparisons is a random network. We proof that, when the
agents don’t have internal bias, this model could be approached to a potts model. We also compare
the behavior between altruistic and non-altruistic agents and we found that altruistic behavior alters
the robustness of the network.

INTRODUCTION

Complex networks connected by complex web like structures has been intensively studied, assuming that their
elements are homogeneous. Such networks could be generated by means of technical elements and be used for
communication [1] (airports, wireless links, internet, etc.) or could be deﬁned as communication between individuals
(social networks) [2].

We model agents that, after a distribution of goods, subtend a network of interpersonal comparison. The fair
distribution of goods is an old problem in mathematics that concern not only distribution of perfect divisible goods
(for example a cake), but also the distribution of for example CO2 emissions [3, 4]. Along this work we not search
for an optimal distribution, but analyse the ’feelings’ arising after this distribution is done. After a distribution takes
place, agents are allowed to make interpersonal comparisons, depending on how this distribution was done and how
were the individual satisfaction levels among the agents [5]. The mechanism is as follows: each agent is endowed with
a pre-established list of preferences that produce a bias in the distribution. Each agent tries to optimize the number
of elements she becomes according to this preference list. This bias appears not only as a pre-distribution but also
a post distribution mechanism: the agents are allowed to subtend a network of interpersonal comparisons according
to the preferences that were not fulﬁlled. Such network is basically an information-exchange network. This model
can be generalized for information networks that emerge in systems which are not symmetric and far from equilibria,
because of the individual bias.

The existence of individual bias (preferences) could change the topology of the network. This characteristic is
relevant for weighed unidirectional networks [6]. However, the general alternative proposed in this work may motivate
a new class of models for random networks. The nodes of our network are not only deﬁned by the agents, but also
by the material and cognitive possessions each agent has. Each state is not aprioristically deﬁned, but is computed
after the distribution process, depending on the individual bias. At diﬀerence with conventional models (for a general
review see [1]), our approach can concern the deﬁnition of elements (nodes of the comparison network), not only with
diﬀerent but also with changing identities.

An important task concerning random networks is to describe how its formation and connectivity are. For instance,
the analysis of distribution of connections per node has been analyzed for Internet [7]. In a previous work the connec-
tivity was only analyzed as a function of the kind of distribution [5]. But agents, making interpersonal comparisons,
are also exchanging information in form of visual contacts. This information can randomly be controlled, for example,
avoiding that an agent look into the basket of other agent in the neighbor. We call this mechanism censure. This
control is equivalent to a random breakdown, where elements in the network are randomly removed [1, 8]. If p is a
fraction of nodes under censure, then, after some threshold value pc, the network disintegrates it into smaller discon-
nected parts. Below the critical threshold value the network, connecting each of the nodes, persists. The random
breakdown of a network can be seen as an inﬁnite dimensional percolation.

Non homogeneous and constant nodes have been already studied [9]. As a diﬀerence our nodes also are able to
change their identities, making the inhomogeneities dependent on the time. The agents can behave in two diﬀerent
ways. Either they simply subtend a network of interpersonal comparisons after the distribution process, or they can be
altruistic. Altruistic agents are giving some of their owned goods to agents with a lower satisfaction level, attempting
to improve the welfare of the system. Each node consist of a cognitive part (the agent able to make decisions and
with a mental bias) and a material part (the basket with goods). Thus, a donation of a good implies an identity
change. By using this example we try to answer the question, if this change of identity may induce a change in the
percolation transition (breakdown of the connectivity of the nodes) of the network.

II. MODEL AND FORMALISM

Hamiltonian: The internal restrictions imposed to individual agents are the basis of a non-equilibrium state. For
instance, in the case of a distribution of goods, individual bias does not allow an equitable distribution. However, the
system tries to compensate this non-equilibrium state by means of interpersonal comparisons that could later imply
interpersonal exchange of goods. This situation has been previously implemented for individual agents randomly
matched according to similarity of preferences promoting exchange [10]. These comparisons are essentially an exchange
of information, because each agent gets ’visual’ information of the goods other agents owns. Each agent has a bias to
the kind of goods but not to the kind of neighbor agent. Therefore, this information exchange happens in a random
way, conforming a random network between agents. In the following part the deﬁnition of the Hamilton function for
the exchange and its states is done.

For each interpersonal comparison we deﬁne a Hamiltonian function in a similar way as for a multi-state system,
where the energy relation of the system is given by its connectivity [11]. The function Ei(j) depends on the order of
the restriction imposed to the system. Here, the restriction is the preference ranking in a system of envious agents.
If it is not possible to establish any comparison between two agents with the ﬁrst element of the list, then the second
element in the list is used as restriction to the comparison. We deﬁne here this restriction by Ck in the following form

An interpersonal comparison is allowed only if an agent express some dissatisfacion. This expression is more precisely
deﬁned in the following way

in eq. (2) bi are the baskets, where the agents store their goods after the distribution. Pi(l) is the preference list, that
depends on the class of goods l. Using this notion, the function Ei(j) has the following form

where Θ(x) is the step function, Bi are individual states, with k the number of elements into the basket bi of each
agent i and K the total amount of elements.

The equation 3 is the deﬁnition of the individual states of the system. The Hamiltonian is in general deﬁned as the

connectivity between diﬀerent states, and is given as the sum over i and j of Eq. (3)

This model belongs to a general class of models, which under some constrains appear like a conventional multi-state
system, like a potts model. This relation can be stablished if we suppose that there is only one element in the ranking
list, such that Ck = 1, and that the interpersonal comparisons are done around a basket with only one class of objects
bi(k0). Assuming that around these values bi(k) < bj(k) (k ≈ k0) one obtains

Ei(j) ≈ −

δ(bi(k) − bj(k))(bi(k) − bi(k0)).

which is similar in its form to the Hamiltonian of a Potts model, where bi represents N discrete states. In a multi-agent
system joined by a random network, N is the number of agents. Therefore, a link is formed between bi and bj only if
they are in the same state, that is, similar baskets and similar preferences [12]. In a similar way as in a Potts model,
the parameter η(i, j) is equivalent to the temperature of the system.

In a previous study, the identity of the elements has been deﬁned in a static form [5]. However, this identity can
change and be tracked. This assumption is more realistic to model multi-agent systems, than the consideration of
ﬁxed properties. We assume a pre-distribution inside the states bi previous to the conformation of the connections
between states. In our example of dissatisﬁed agents, this assumption is equivalent to altruistic agents that donate
the elements of their baskets to other agents.

Indeed, an additional equation of motion for the redistribution of the elements among the states bi must be

considered. A donation from agent j to agent i is given by

whereas for the agent j the following process (substraction inside the state bj) takes place

bi(t + 1) = bi(t) +

in both cases Nd represents the number of donators into the system and ω0 is the allowed interchange frequency. Both
equations of motion (10) and (11) are coupled to the equation of motion for the number of connected states in Eq.
(9).

The whole system is subjected to an initial non-symmetrical distribution G(K) of K elements among the agents. As
was deﬁned in a similar model [5], where the distribution function were deﬁned as a gamma function, the symmetry
of the distribution of goods among the individuals depends on a parameter A, i.e if A → 0, then the distribution is
not fair. This asymmetry sets the system out from equilibrium and motivates the interpersonal comparison. In this
context a question remains: is the information exchange, the initial distribution, deﬁned by A, or both parameters
relevant for the behavior of the system? Which of both parameters can modulate the interpersonal comparisons into
the system?

system. With less censure the agents are allowed to compare themselves, increasing the ﬂuctuations into the system.
In the present results, κ represents the censure (temperature) parameter, which is also equivalent to the breakdown
parameter of the network.

The control on the connectivity is equivalent to the random breakdown of networks, i.e. the number of agents that
are not able to exchange information is equivalent to remove the agent from the network. The principal observables
here are the fraction of nodes that resist to interpersonal comparisons as a function of κ. Using this notion, the
number of linked states C as a function of the frequency of information exchange f l was estimated. For f l = 0 the
system starts from a fully non-interconnected state. Whereas the system evolves, the connectivity between agents
increases. For f l → ∞ the system reaches an equilibrium. The time series for some states as a function of κ is shown
in Fig. 1.

For very low values of κ, there is a clear separation of linked and non-linked agents. Conform the connectivity
increases, the phase separation decreases. Eventually at some κc there is a mixture of linked and non-linked agents.
For values above this point the system saturates, i.e. reaches a maxima in the number of links between agents. The
number of linked states C is shown in Fig. 2. Here is important to observe that there is no complete mixture between
linked and non-linked agents for κ > κc. Given that in each iteration there are agents that are completely satisﬁed,
they are of course indiﬀerent to the modiﬁcation of the parameter κ, yielding a shift in the distribution of linked
agents.

FIG. 2: Non normalized density of states ρ(C) is presented for diﬀerent parameters κ (κ = 0.1 upper left, κ = 0.5 upper right,
κ = 0.8 under left, κ = 1 under right) and ﬁxed initial distribution A = 80. Due that there are agents that reach a high
satisfaction level in few iteration steps, there is no total mixture of satisﬁed and unsatisﬁed agents at κ ∼ κc.

The role of κ is decisive for the transition from fully interconnected agents to isolated ones. The phase behavior
of the density of states as a function of κ has been investigated and plotted in Fig. 3. Indeed, two main cases are
compared: when an initial distribution G(K) and interpersonal comparisons arises, and when an additional altruistic
distribution of goods between agents takes place. This comparison is made for a ﬁxed distribution A. In this plot the

5

fraction of the number of the non connected nodes in relation to the connected nodes (CN = C − CE) CN (κ)/CE as
a function of κ (normalized) is shown, where CE is the maximal number of connected nodes.

In both cases, the relative density of states decays in a lineal form, i.e. C ∼ κ. The slope of the curves depends
on whether there is altruistic exchange or not. This lineal dependence is valid for κ << κc. However, conform κ
approaches to its critical value, a non-linear behavior for values of CN /CE is found. For non altruistic agents there
is a small step for 0.92 < κ < 0.96. For κ > 0.96 the system reaches a saturation, and the relative density reaches a
plateau. This behavior could be related with ﬁnite size eﬀects.

The presence of altruistic agents makes the behavior of the system more interesting. The phase diagram has at
least two plateaus for κ < κc, one at κ = 0.92 and κ = 0.96. The last plateau is reached when the system is saturated,
i.e. for κ ≤ 1. One can assume that this eﬀect is due to statistical errors in the estimation of the results. However,
the error estimated is above the curve for non-exchange (see the inset of Fig. 2). Despite the network presents these
breakdowns, the network still preservesits robustness while κ increases. The transition in this case takes place for κ
larger than the transition without exchange.

FIG. 3: Phase diagram of the fraction of agents resistant interpersonal comparisons as a function of the random breakdown
of the network, given by the parameter κ. The behavior for both altruistic and non-altruistic agents is compared; both cases
were ﬁtet with a linear regretion, with two slopes B1 and B2. The behavior of altruistic agents for A = 40 is also shown.In the
inset the behavior of the curve close to the critical parameter κc is shown.

If altruism takes place, the interconnectivity cannot increase and an internal resistance grows until a new saturation
is reached. Indeed, this behavior can be described as a kind of fractional formation of interconnected agents, where
exchange between agents on k changes the internal energy of the system.

One can suppose that the initial distribution G(k) may change the phase behavior of the interconnectivity between
agents. The simulations performed for A = 40 show that the behavior is similar to A = 80 for κ < κc. This result
conﬁrms and generalizes the results obtained in a previous work [5]. For κ ∼ κc the fraction of agents resistant to
interpersonal comparisons is higher. This result is surprising but not strange, because the asymmetric the initial
distribution, the faster some agents can ﬁll their baskets, increasing the number of agents that are insensitive to
the parameter κ.
In both cases κc is a ﬁxed point. Hence, the symmetry of the initial distribution modify the
phase behavior of the system near the critical point, but not the whole behavior, which essentially depends on the
information exchange between agents and on the change of the states bi(k) by internal redistribution of k, i.e. on
information exchange and altruism.

IV. DISCUSSION

In general, the change of identity of the elements of a random network may inﬂuence its robustness. We were not
able to introduce a dramatic change in the robustness of the network; however, it is possible that extreme ﬂuctuations
in the identity of the elements may introduce changes, increasing the resistance to make new connections in the
network. In extreme cases such ﬂuctuations could break down the connectivity of the network. Other important
aspect is the deﬁnition of the network.
In speciﬁc problems, the identity of the elements may depend on initial
deﬁnitions that cannot be made ad-hoc, as has been shown in the present example of interpersonal comparisons.

6

Intuitively one can assume that altruism, or redistribution on the number of objects k among the agents, can avoid
the formation of interconnected states. However, the present results show that above a critical censure parameter κc
the system is fully interconnected. The eﬀect of altruism, as deﬁned for the present work, is remarkable for states close
to κc: it does not avoid the transition from connected to disconnected states, but oﬀers a resistance in the formation
of such connections

The modulation of the information exchange, i.e., the intensity of the censure, and not the distribution, is essential
in the control of interpersonal comparisons. However, the symmetry of the elements and their equilibrium, which
depends, in the present example, on the distribution of goods among the agents, have inﬂuence in the robustness
of the network. If the system is close to equilibrium, i.e. there is an equitable distribution (when the parameter A
is large), the agents have more chance to make donation of goods because there are more available goods to give,
modifying the frequency of interpersonal comparisons. Otherwise, the asymmetry of the initial distribution cannot
be prevented by donations and a network of comparisons emerges.

In the whole model the individual biases play a relevant role. They are relevant for the deﬁnition of part of the
nodes, of the interpersonal comparisons and the promoting of an altruistic behavior. Hence the formation of these
biases is relevant in the formulation of such kind of models. The simple variant adopted in this work is to deﬁne
them in a random way. However, information exchange should be also considered in more realistic models, not only
as simple interpersonal comparison, but also in formation and modiﬁcation of such biases.

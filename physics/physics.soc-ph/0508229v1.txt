Abstract
We consider the spreading and competition of languages that are spoken by
a population of individuals. The individuals can change their mother tongue
during their lifespan, pass on their language to their oﬀspring and ﬁnally
die. The languages are described by bitstrings, their mutual diﬀerence is
expressed in terms of their Hamming distance. Language evolution is deter-
mined by mutation and adaptation rates. In particular we consider the case
where the replacement of a language by another one is determined by their
mutual Hamming distance. As a function of the mutation rate we ﬁnd a sharp
transition between a scenario with one dominant language and fragmentation
into many language clusters. The transition is also reﬂected in the Hamming
distance between the two languages with the largest and second to largest
number of speakers. We also consider the case where the population is local-
ized on a square lattice and the interaction of individuals is restricted to a
certain geometrical domain. Here it is again the Hamming distance that plays
an essential role in the ﬁnal fate of a language of either surviving or being
extinct.

Keywords: evolution of languages, population dynamics, bitstring models

1 Introduction

Evolution of language attracts the attention of linguists, neuro- and computer-
scientists, as well as physicists. It concerns basic questions as the origin of speech,
the role of mimicry and movement, ﬁne and rapid motor control, but also language
development [1]. Language development refers to the individual level during child-
hood, but also to language evolution of mankind on a global scale. The evolution
of a single language as a function of time may refer to a transformation of this
language, say from ancient Latin to modern Italian.

When we talk about language evolution or language development in this paper,
we address the spreading, competition, extinction and dominance of languages as a

1

function of mutation and adaptation rates that characterize the individual speak-
ers. Similarly to the evolution of cultural traits for various cultural features to a
homogeneous or multicultural polarized state [2], one may ask here how an initially
multilingual population evolves: do the languages of individuals converge to a com-
mon “lingua franca” in the very end, or is a fragmentation into many coexisting
language clusters the ﬁnal state?

From daily-life experience it is intuitively clear that opposing tendencies are at
work: the convenience of having one common language and the deﬁnition of national
identity via language favor language dominance or fragmentation, respectively. How-
ever, when it comes to predictions for one of those scenarios, speciﬁc mathematical
modelling is needed to understand the transition between dominance and fragmen-
tation as various parameters change, and to predict more speciﬁc features of this
transition, e.g. whether it is sharp or smooth.

Evolutionary models for language development have only recently been proposed.
There are macroscopic models, formulated in terms of diﬀerential (rate) equations
for population rates (that speak a certain language)[3]. They are macroscopic in the
sense that the fate of individuals is completely ignored for language competition and
the population rates refer to average quantities. Stauﬀer and Schulze [4] performed
microscopic simulations of language populations. Individuals inherit their mother
tongue from their parents, with a certain amount of mutation. They change (adapt,
replace) their language during their lifespan, pass on their language to oﬀspring,
again with a certain amount of mutation, and ﬁnally die. The time evolution of the
population follows a Verhulst dynamics until a stable population size is achieved.
The individuals are described by bitstrings which code for their language. There
are as many diﬀerent languages possible in the population as bitstring states, that
is 2n if n is the length of the string.

In this paper we extend the simulations of Schulze and Stauﬀer to include the
measurement of the Hamming distance between the dominating languages. We also
generalize their model to implement the Hamming distance in the interaction of in-
dividuals. A language replacement is more likely to happen between languages with
small Hamming distance than with large one. Moreover, we locate the population
on a network (so far on a square lattice, for simplicity) to simulate the inﬂuence
of neighborhood. The neighborhood can refer to “external” (geometric) or “inter-
nal” (social) space. Individuals inﬂuence their various languages within a certain
neighborhood, the so-called interaction range.

In the simulations so far [4], all positions of bits within a bitstring are on an equal
footing; we do not attempt any mapping from features of languages like grammar,
syntax, vocabulary, to particular sequences of bits. Therefore, although languages
diﬀering by just one bit in their bitstring description would probably more appro-
priately be called dialects, our model is too rough for such distinctions. In principle,
it would be possible to reserve a certain part of the bit-sequence to grammatical fea-
tures, others to the vocabulary and so on; the rules for changing the bits would then
depend on the position in the string. Such generalizations are left for the future.

2

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present our model, in section
3 we summarize the results of the simulations and give a ﬁnal outlook in section 4.

2 The Model

In this paper we consider extensions of the model presented in [4]. The ﬁrst one deals
with a population with random interactions, independent of the spatial location of
individuals, the second one with a population living on a square lattice with free
and periodic boundary conditions, and a ﬁnite interaction range.

2.1 Language population with random interactions

We consider a population of individuals described by bitstrings of length n = 32; as
argued in [4], n = 30 is already considered suﬃcient for language simulations. The
position of a bit inside the string is given no speciﬁc meaning apart from its use
as coordinate to specify a certain language. All 2n possible diﬀerent realizations of
a bitstring are called languages. Two diﬀerent bitstrings are thought to represent
diﬀerent languages, even if they diﬀer just by one bit.

The number of individuals, i.e. the population size, evolves according to a Ver-
hulst dynamics. At each time step, an individual can either die, or live and give
birth to one oﬀspring with probability α. Here we have chosen α = 1 in all simula-
tions. This means that an individual has one oﬀspring once it survives at time step
t. Death occurs due to competition for resources, so that the probability for dying
is chosen proportional to the population size N at time t; that is, β · N(t). The
population size eﬀectively follows a dynamics determined by

dN(t)
dt

= α · (1 − βN(t)) · N(t) − βN(t)2

(1)

The gain term (ﬁrst term) on the r.h.s. of Eq.(1) reﬂects the rule that at time t,
only that fraction of the population which does not die at that time-step [that is,
(1 − βN(t))], can have an oﬀspring, with probability α. The loss term (second term)
is quadratic in N(t) to implement the competition for resources: death occurs with
a probability proportional to the current population size. A stationary population
size N0 is obtained for α and β chosen such that N0 =
(1+α)·β . In the simulation,
we chose α and N0 as independent parameters, and adjusted β accordingly.

α

As oﬀspring are born, they inherit their “mother” tongue from their parent
(parent in the singular, because, for simplicity, we consider asexual reproduction
within this model; sexual reproduction would oﬀer the interesting option for oﬀspring
to grow up bilingually [5].) With a probability p, the language of a newly-born can
undergo a mutation, in which one randomly chosen bit is switched from the value
inherited from the parent.

So far the model is similar to genetic models used in a biological context, e.g.
in the context of aging, in which individuals are born and die while their genes

3

suﬀer from (deleterious) mutations. In contrast to genes, however, languages can be
completely exchanged by their speakers during lifetime. It is not unusual for speakers
of a language minority to change their language to that spoken by the majority of
population. To model this behavior, an individual who speaks a language shared by
a fraction x of the population, can change its language with probability q · (1 − x)2
to the language of a randomly chosen individual. The parameter q is called the
language change parameter. (Note that the notation here for q is diﬀerent from that
in [4].)

Large populations (strictly speaking, large population densities) usually increase
the social pressure. Since it is often the social pressure that leads to a language
switch, we further multiply q · (1 − x)2 by N(t)/N0 so that the pressure is smaller
in the expansion period than in the stable state. The power of (1 − x), here chosen
as two, can be used to tune the “social pressure”. The larger the exponent the
less likely a switch in language of the minority speakers. The eﬀective exponent is
actually three, because there is also the possibility that the randomly chosen person
whose language is the new candidate for a switch, speaks the same language as the
original one.

We extended the simulations of Schulze and Stauﬀer to measure the Hamming
distance between languages.
(The Hamming distance between two bitstrings is
deﬁned as the number of bits at corresponding positions inside the string, by which
the two strings diﬀer.) The Hamming distance is a quantitative measure for how
much two languages diﬀer. In this paper we are interested in the Hamming distance
between the languages with the largest and the second largest number of speakers.
Are these languages similar or very diﬀerent? Moreover, this measure allows to
implement and model language barriers of the type that an Italian is more likely to
learn French than Chinese, since the learning eﬀort is proportional to the diﬀerence.
In an extended version of the former model, that we consider below, an individual
with language A switches to language B of another individual, randomly chosen
from the population together with m − 1 other individuals, but distinguished by
the fact that language B comes closest to A in terms of the Hamming distance. In
case that several candidates come closest to A, because they have the same shortest
distance to A, we take the ﬁrst one out of the selection process. For m = 1 the model
reduces to the former one. Again the switch is not deterministic, but happens with
probability q · (1 − x)2 · N(t)/N0.

To summarize: the parameters that govern language dynamics in these models,
are the number n of bits in a string coding a speciﬁc language, the birth rate α for
oﬀspring, the asymptotic population size N0 (implicitly determining the death rate
∝ β), the language mutation rate p, the language change parameter q, and, in the
extended version, the number m of individuals that is analyzed with respect to their
similarities, before the individual decides about a switch.

So far, all 2n diﬀerent languages, described by the state space of bit strings,
are treated on an equal footing. Eﬀective weights come only from their number of
speakers, but no intrinsic ﬁtness was assigned to languages within these models.

2.2 Language population on a lattice

In this model, the “language population”, is placed on a square lattice. This as-
signment allows the description of interactions that depend on the distance. The
distance may either represent the distance in Euclidean space or in internal space,
where “internal” can be e.g. “social”. The distance in Euclidean space plays a
role for modelling situations in which the pressure on people for learning a foreign
language is small when they live in the center of a large country rather than at the
border with another country. Due to modern communication channels, this distance
has lost its meaning to a certain extent, because an individual, exposed to a foreign
country, can keep and speak its mother tongue with friends via phone or internet.
In this case, the friends would represent the nearest neighbors on a square lattice
in internal space. Of course, the regular features of a square lattice look unrealistic
as compared to network topologies like small-world, hierarchical, or scale-free net-
works, but as we shall see below, we use the regular features only for deﬁning the
interaction range. Out of this interaction range, randomly selected sites are then
chosen for language comparison to decide which language is taken over.

For simplicity we suppress the aspect of population evolution: there are no birth
or death rates, and each lattice site is always occupied. To simplify the wording,
from now on we will no longer distinguish between an individual or speaker who
speaks a certain language, and the language itself, since individuals are exclusively
speciﬁed by their language (at a given site.) At each time step, each individual
can change its language with probability q, to a diﬀerent one chosen from those
within a given interaction range. The interaction range is deﬁned as a rectangular
region centered at the individual. The half-height ∆i and the half-width ∆j of this
region are parameters of the simulation. Both periodic and non-periodic boundary
conditions are implemented. In order to choose the language to which an individual
switches, we use a rule similar to the former model: the individual randomly selects
m languages out of the interaction range, and then chooses the one that is closest
to its own in terms of Hamming distance. Due to the random selection within the
interaction range, we actually use the regular features of the square lattice in a very
weak form. The selected candidates may be nearest, next-to-nearest neighbors or
the like. The ﬁnite size of the square lattice enters in case of non-periodic boundary
conditions via the interaction range that is chopped to ﬁt into the simulation area
when it touches the boundary.
In case of periodic boundary conditions, lattice
sites on opposite boundaries are identiﬁed as usual, so that the interaction range is
embedded in a torus.

In addition to language switches, at each time-step individuals mutate their
language with probability p by a one-bit mutation, as in the previous model by
Schulze and Stauﬀer. Due to the localization of speakers, the simulations amount
to an animation that shows the state of the language lattice at each time step.
Mechanisms such as language dominance or cluster formation are easily visualized
this way. (For language simulations on lattices see also [6].)

3 Results

3.1 Language population with random interactions

We performed simulations for population sizes N0 ranging from 1000 to 100 000 (in
factors of 10), for mutation rate and language change parameters from 0 to 1 in
various steps (see below), and for lengths n of the bitstrings with 16 ≤ n ≤ 32 in
steps of 1. We considered cases with language switch independent and dependent
on the Hamming distance (m = 1 and m = 4, respectively, in the notation of the
previous section.) In order to check the dependence on the initial conditions, we
focused on two cases; in the ﬁrst case we studied one initial speaker with language
zero and let the population grow until it reached its stable size; in the second case, the
population was initially comprised of the asymptotic number N0 of individuals, half
of them speaking language 00(16), and the other half speaking FF(16). Here we are
using a common notation for hexadecimal numbers, that is 00(16) = 0·160+0·161 = 0,
FF(16) = 15·160+15·161 = 255. In the bitstring, coding for language 255(10) ≡ FF(16),
n−8 zero-bits are followed by 8 one-bits, where n was usually chosen as 32. We were
interested in this latter case to see whether competition of two equally represented
languages leads to the dominance of one of them or to the rise of a third one.

Each simulation was run for 1000 time-steps, and the following parameters were

recorded every 10 steps

• the number of individuals in the population N(t)

• the number of languages with more than ten speakers nl

• the fraction of the population speaking the language of the majority f0(t)

• the fraction of the population speaking the language with the second largest

number of speakers f1(t)

speakers d0(t)

• the Hamming distance between the languages with the two largest numbers of

After the last time-step of each simulation, we recorded these parameters to-
gether with the bitstrings for the two “largest” languages in order to measure their
Hamming distance. As it turned out, already after less than a hundred iterations,
N(t), n1, f0(t), f1(t), and d0(t) reached their stable values in both cases, m = 1
and m = 4, so that 1000 time-steps were suﬃcient for the population to stabilize in
these properties.

3.2 Language switch independent of the Hamming distance

In our simulations, after 1000 time-steps, we observed essentially two scenarios. In
the ﬁrst one the language population is characterized by dominance of one language
that comprises the largest part of the population, while the rest of the population

is scattered between many small languages. The second scenario is fragmentation,
a state in which no language has signiﬁcantly more speakers than the others. The
dominance of languages is accompanied by the fact that in this phase the Hamming
distance between the two largest languages is usually equal to 1, that is, the smallest
possible value for two diﬀerent languages. Therefore, an even larger part of the
population speaks almost the same language. In the absence of a dominant language,
the Hamming distance between the two largest languages is large, about 16 (for
n = 32) in our simulations.

The way we have implemented the switch to another language supports language
dominance, since speakers of a minority language have a high probability to switch
to the majority language when they randomly select the language to which they
switch. On the other hand, mutation acts toward fragmentation by spreading the
speakers in language space. The result of these competing tendencies can hardly be
predicted intuitively. It was therefore analyzed in the simulations. The transition
between these two cases is sharp, it looks like ﬁrst order, and, all other parameters
ﬁxed, occurs at a critical value of the mutation rate, p0. This can be seen, for
instance, in Figure 1, where the relative size of the largest language is large for
p < p0 and almost zero for p > p0 (in Figure 1a the initial population contained only
one speaker of language zero, while it had N0 speakers in Figure 1b, half speaking
language 00(16), half FF(16). Therefore, initially, also in the latter case only the eight
most-right bits out of the 32 are ”used”, i.e. they are one, but later, during the
simulation, all other 24 bits may be switched to one due to the random mutations.)
As mentioned in [4], we also observed that at values p close to p0, it may be possible
to obtain both dominance and fragmentation in diﬀerent runs of the simulation.

The position p0 of the phase transition depends on a number of factors. Since

the mutation rate p acts toward fragmentation, while the language change param-
eter q acts toward dominance, p0 will obviously depend on q as it is already seen
from Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the critical mutation rate on the
language change parameter q for diﬀerent population sizes. As observed in [4], p0
also depends on the size of the population, although the tested range was varied
only between 1000 and 100 000 individuals, while in [4] it was varied up to 107.

simulation. In case the initial population starts with many speakers of two evenly
represented languages, here chosen as 00(16) and FF(16), the critical mutation rates
are larger than in the case of initially one individual, especially for large values of
the language change parameter q, Figure 3. This eﬀect can be explained by the fact
that it is harder to break the initially big domains of languages, in contrast to the
single speaker of language zero in the other case.

As we have seen above, in the case of dominance, one language has many more
speakers than all the others. Due to mutation, a fraction of these speakers switches
at each time step to a language that diﬀers from the largest one by a single bit.
In the stationary state, the number of speakers who switch to such a language,
is approximately equal to the number of speakers who switch back to the largest
population due to the option of a language switch. Since in this realization a single
mutation cannot change the language by more than one bit, languages that diﬀer
by two or more bits from the largest one are disfavored.

The eﬀect is seen in measurements of the Hamming distance (number of diﬀerent
bits) between the two largest languages. It is equal to one (rarely two) before the
transition (p < p0), and large (around 16 for n = 32 bits per language) after the
transition. Figure 4 shows this eﬀect also in dependence on the initial conditions.
The coincidence of the transition in the Hamming distance with the one in the
relative size of the largest language can be seen in Figure 5.

Moreover, we observed that in case of dominance, the ﬁnal largest language is one
of the initial languages, possibly with one or two bits mutated. In the case where
initially there is only one speaker of language zero, the ﬁnal dominant language
is thus expected to be language zero or a one- or two-bit mutation of it.
Initial
conditions with languages 00(16) and FF(16) lead to a ﬁnal dominant language that

is one of the initial two, up to a few mutations. Therefore we can neither describe
the evolution from ancient Latin to modern Italian as long as one-bit mutations
are unbiased, nor the creation of English out of ancient French and ancient German
within this model, as long as we only allow one-bit mutations and complete switches,
but no “superposition” of languages in analogy to the mixing of genes in biology
(cf. [7] for a proposal of a model in this direction.)

The previous results were obtained by using n = 32 bits per language. The
position of the phase transition is largely independent of the bitlength n. This can
be expected because the language switch, which is opposing dominance, is itself
independent of n. The critical mutation rate for various bitlengths is plotted in
Figure 6, for the case where in the initial state there was one speaker of language
zero. We observed the same eﬀect when we had in the initial state N0 speakers
equally spread among two languages.

In view of computational aspects we remark that bitstrings as long as 32 bits
(providing a large language space, but for the case of less large population size), were
eﬃciently treated by using a hash-table, so that the complexity of the simulation
was O(N), i.e. linear in the population size.

3.3 Language switch determined by the Hamming distance

In case the language switch depends on the Hamming distance, as described in sec-
tion 2.1, the formation of language clusters is more favored than the dominance
scenario as compared to the previous model (m = 1), since each individual is more
conservative in changing its language. Therefore the sharp transition that was ob-

there is no noticeable diﬀerence between the evolution for one or two initial lan-
guages, cf. Figures 7a and 7b. This supports the idea of the previous subsection
that the dependence on the initial conditions is related to the language dominance,
and since dominance in this model is disfavored, the inﬂuence due to dominance
should be less visible.

Figure 8: Phase transition in the Hamming distance between the two largest languages, in the
case of Hamming-distance dependent language change (with m = 4.) Values are averages of two
runs for each p. Asymptotic population size is N0 = 100 000 in both cases. a. Initially one speaker
of language zero. b. Initially N0 speakers evenly distributed among languages 00(16) and FF(16).

The crossover from dominance to fragmentation is still seen as a sharp transition
in the Hamming distance between the two largest languages. As it is seen from
Figure 8, the Hamming distance is equal to one up to a certain critical mutation
rate p0 and then rises rather abruptly to values larger than 10. Again, the position
of p0 is relatively independent on whether there were initially one or two languages.
We also observed a large variation of the Hamming distance for diﬀerent runs
at the same values of the parameters; changes as high as 30% were observed in the
case of fragmentation.

3.4 Language population on a lattice

In this paper we report on results of language evolution on a lattice that allow a vi-
sualization of the results, that is, we made snapshots of the language population on
the square lattice after each iteration. The simulations were performed on a square
lattice of size 400 × 400 with free boundary conditions, n = 16 bits, mutation rate
p = 0.01, language change rate q = 0.50, and interaction range 41 × 41. The number
of individuals considered for language change was m = 2. As it turned out in the
simulations, the parameters p and q of language mutation and language switch are
of little relevance for the outcome compared to the initial conditions, in contrast
to the simulations of the m = 1 model. Because of the similarity with the m = 4
model of the previous section, it is not surprising that we found a smooth crossover
from the dominance scenario, in which only a few languages survive, to the complete
fragmentation. Note that the m = 4 model and the m = 2 lattice population essen-
tially diﬀer by the location of the interaction range, here centered at an individual
and extended to a ﬁnite (possibly small) subset of the lattice in its neighborhood.

12

The former simulation was non-localized, i.e. any subset of m speakers could be
selected from the whole population. This diﬀerence is probably responsible for the
stronger dependence on the initial conditions that is observed here: when the mu-
tation rate is chosen small enough and the language change parameter large enough
to form stationary language clusters, the number of such clusters and their location
and shape are less likely “washed out” by random interactions, but determined by
the initial conditions of the simulation.

Based on the description of the model of section 2.2, a few general features of
these simulations can be deduced. It is seen in Figure 9 that the interface between

due to the curvature, the area

two languages is only stable if it is straight (if q > 0): an individual placed on
the border will probably change its language to the one that is predominant within
the interaction range centered at it. A curvature in the interface will make the
population on the concave side of the curvature to have less speakers within the
interaction range than the population on the other side; therefore, the former is
disfavored with respect to the latter language. Moreover, by this argument it can
be deduced that any cluster of one language completely surrounded by sites with a
diﬀerent language will not survive; due to the rule described above, it will shrink
continuously, until it becomes smaller than the interaction range; in this case it
quickly fades away as the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the interaction range
becomes larger and larger. This process can be seen in simulation snapshots. In
Figure 10 we see the time evolution (from left to right) of how a disk of one language
initially surrounded by a diﬀerent language eventually shrinks to zero. This fate of
a language island would change in an extended model, in which inhabitants of the
island can communicate (via internet, phone, satellite-TV) with remote speakers of
their own language.

In Figure 11 we see a stable coexistence of two languages across a straight bor-
der, with an inter-penetration depth that is determined by the size of the interaction
range. The ﬁgure on the left is taken soon after the beginning of the simulation,

an extended version of this model, one could imitate diﬀerent language policies in
neighboring countries, leading to asymmetrical penetration depths.

Beyond the coexistence of two languages along straight borderlines, we simulated
the coexistence of three languages, Figure 12 (again, time goes from left to right.)
The initial conditions had one language, in the shape of a square, in the middle of a
“gradient” of languages, where the languages were the same along horizontal lines,
and changing from line to line. The gradient of languages started from language
3500(16) (again in hexadecimal notation) at the top of the simulation space, and the
language code (in terms of integers) increased by one each line, up to CB00(16) at
the bottom with n−16 leading zero bits. Due to this gradient, none of the languages
outside the square is strong enough, and the engulfed language can “capture” the
middle of the simulation lattice. The gradient is transformed into clusters from which
only the upper and the lower two remain stable (as indicated in the outermost right
picture in Figure 12. Note that similar shades of grey at the top and bottom of the
picture do not necessarily correspond to similar languages.)

The language evolution presented in Figure 13 (time from left to right) shows
how a metastable state is reached, where three languages survive. The state shown
in the right picture survives for some time, but ultimately the upper language is

14

Figure 12: Simulation of the coexistence of three languages.

able to completely eliminate the lower two ones, because it initially occupies twice
the area of the other languages, and due to the interaction rules the probability for
switching to another language is proportional to the area this language occupies.

More interesting in this case is that the ﬁnal state of the simulation depends
on the Hamming distance between the three initial languages.
In Figure 13, the
Hamming distance between any two of the initial languages was equal to two. By
changing only the bitstring describing the upper language, so that the Hamming
distance between it and the lower-left one was equal to one, while the distance to
the lower-right language became three, we obtained the evolution from Figure 14,
If the language in

the lower-left quarter of the plane is close in terms of the Hamming distance to the
language in the upper half-plane, these two eliminate the third language and coexist
as a stable state. As explanation for the extinction of the third language in Figure
14, we note that the upper and lower-left coincide within the range of mutations
if the Hamming distance is small. An individual “living” at the conﬂuence of the
three languages, is going to be biased toward changing its language to the upper
population, because that is predominant within its interaction range. In the next
time-step, only a one-bit mutation can make this individual switch to the lower-
left language, while one time-step is not enough for it to mutate to the lower-right

15

one. In this way, the lower-left language has a slight advantage with respect to the
lower-right one, and we obtain the observed outcome. Stated diﬀerently, the upper
and lower-left languages coincide within the typical size of mutations; by arguments
analogous to those of Figure 10, the lower-right language then fades away.

It would be expected that even for larger values of the Hamming distances, for
instance, when the upper and the lower-left languages diﬀer by 2 bits, while the
diﬀerence between the upper and the lower-right languages is 3 bits, the lower-
left language would still have a slight advantage, and would eventually overrun the
lower-right one. That is indeed observed in simulations. As expected, however, the
time needed to reach the ﬁnal state is longer than in the previous case.

4 Summary and Outlook

4.1 Language population with random interactions

In the original model of Schulze and Stauﬀer, we observe sharp transitions between
phases of language dominance and language fragmentation, and along with this,
transitions between small and large Hamming distances between the two largest
languages, both types of transitions driven by the mutation parameter p for given
language change parameter q and total size N, or, alternatively, driven by q for given
p and N. The precise location of the critical mutation rate depends on the language
change probability q, the initial conditions and the population size. In the extended
model (m = 4), the transition between the dominance and fragmentation phases is
smoothed out, since the switch to another language happens more conservatively;
at the same time, the transition in the Hamming distance is still sharp. For m = 4,
the transitions are less dependent on the initial conditions, because dominance of a
certain language is less favored than in the original model.

In particular, we found in the scenario of language dominance that a population
evolution starting with one speaker initially, does not alter the initial language if the

16

population has reached its stable size and prefers one dominant language. This is
not surprising although unrealistic, because the one-bit mutations happen randomly
and the switches favor dominance. For a stable population size and two coexisting
languages in the beginning, the evolution favors a dominant language in the end
that is one of the coexisting initial languages rather than a “superposition” of both.

4.2 Language population on a square lattice

The evolution of the language population on a square lattice was visualized as a
function of time. The square lattice was only used to deﬁne the interaction range. A
number of m speakers was randomly chosen out of the interaction range and the one
with the smallest Hamming distance to a given language was used in the switch with
probability q. Here we found a sensitive dependence on the initial conditions, and
depending on the mutual Hamming distance, an initial set of two or three coexisting
languages turned out to give unstable, stable or metastable conﬁgurations. Here
further investigations are needed to predict the stability behavior beyond the level
of numerical evidence.

The models considered in this paper allow for several extensions. Biased mu-
tations (with r ≥ 1 bits mutated in a single event) are a necessary condition for
modelling language development from its ancient to the modern version of the lan-
guage. In the so-called language change, we considered only a full replacement of
one language by another one, randomly chosen. Neither the random one-bit muta-
tions nor the full switches will ever mimic the development of English out of ancient
French and ancient German. On a longer time-scale, the bitstring dynamics for
languages should imitate the interaction dynamics of parent genes in sexual repro-
duction, resulting in the genes of their oﬀspring. A description of this dynamics
would need, however, a deeper understanding of language evolution from the view-

Summary. Personal income distributions in Japan are analyzed empirically
and a simple stochastic model of the income process is proposed. Based on
empirical facts, we propose a minimal two-factor model. Our model of personal
income consists of an asset accumulation process and a wage process. We
show that these simple processes can successfully reproduce the empirical
distribution of income. In particular, the model can reproduce the particular
transition of the distribution shape from the middle part to the tail part. This
model also allows us to derive the tail exponent of the distribution analytically.
Keywords. Personal income, Power law, Stochastic model

1 Introduction

Many economists and physicists have studied wealth and income. About one
hundred years ago, Pareto found a power law distribution of wealth and in-
come [13]. However, afterwards, Gibrat clariﬁed that the power law is applica-
ble to only the high wealth and income range, and the remaining part follows a
lognormal distribution [7]. This characteristic of wealth and income was later
rediscovered [2][10][16][17]. Today, it is generally believed that high wealth
and income follow a power law distribution. However, the remaining range of
the distribution has not been settled. Recently an exponential distribution [5]
and a Boltzmann distribution [20] has been proposed.

To explain these characteristics of wealth and income, some mathematical
models have been proposed. One of them is based on a stochastic multiplica-
tive process (SMP). For example, the SMP with lower bound [9], the SMP
with additive noise [15][19], the SMP with wealth exchange [4], and the gen-
eralized Lotka-Voltera model [3][14].

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we empirically study the
personal income distribution in Japan. In Sec. 3, we propose a two-factor
stochastic model to explain income distribution. The last section is devoted
to a summary and discussion.

data, and total income (right).

2 Empirical study of the personal income distribution

In this article we use three data sets. We call them employment income data,
self-assessed income data, and income tax data for top taxpayers. The em-
ployment income data is coarsely tabulated data for the distribution of wages
in the private sector. This is reported by the National Tax Agency of Japan
(NTAJ) [11]. This is composed of two kinds of data. One is for employment
income earners who worked for less than a year, and we can acquire the data
since 1951. For example, a log-log plot of the rank-size distribution of the data
in 1999 is shown by the open circles in the left panel of Fig. 1. The other is
for employment income earners who worked throughout the year, and we can
acquire the data since 1950. For example, the distribution in 1999 is shown
by the open squares in the left panel of Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure the crosses are
the sum of these two data, and are almost the same as the distribution of
employment income earners who worked throughout the year.

The self-assessed income data is also reported by NTAJ. This is also
coarsely tabulated data, and we can acquire this since 1887. The income tax
law was changed many times, and so the characteristics of this data also
changed many times. However, this data consistently contains high income
earners. In Japan, in recent years, persons who have some income source, who
earned more than 20 million yen, and who are not employees must declare
their income. For example, the distribution in 1999 is shown by the open tri-
angles in the right panel of Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure the ﬁlled circles are the sum
of the employment income data and the self-assessed income data. However,
we use only the self-assessed income data in the range greater than 20 mil-

lion yen. This is because persons who earned more than 20 million yen must
declare their income, even if they are employees and have only one income
source. This ﬁgure shows that the distribution of middle and low income is
almost the same as that of the employment income. This means that the main
income source of middle and low income earners is wages.

In Japan, if the amount of one’s income tax exceeds 10 million yen, the
individual’s name and the amount of income tax are made public by each
tax oﬃce. Some data companies collect this and produce income tax data
for top taxpayers. We obtained this data from 1987 to 2000. For example, the
distribution in 1999 is shown by the open diamonds in the right panel of Fig. 1.
To understand the whole image of distribution, we must convert income tax
to income. We know from the self-assessed income data that the income of the
40,623th person is 50 million yen,. On the other hand we also know from the
income tax data for top taxpayers that the income tax of the 40,623th person
is 13.984 million yen Hence, if we assume a linear relation between income and
income tax, we can convert income tax to income by multiplying 3.5755 by
the income tax [1]. The dots in Fig. 1 represent the distribution of converted
income tax. This clearly shows the power law distribution in the high income
range, and the particular transition of the distribution shape from the middle
part to the tail part.

2.1 Income sources

Understanding income sources is important for the modeling of the income
process. As we saw above, the main income source of middle and low income
earners is wages. We can also see the income sources of high income earners
from the report of NTAJ. The top panel of Fig. 2 shows a number of high
income earners who earned income greater than 50 million yen in each year
from 2000 to 2003. In this ﬁgure income sources are divided into the 14 cat-
egories of business income, farm income, interest income, dividends, rental
income, wages & salaries, comprehensive capital gains, sporadic income, mis-
cellaneous income, forestry income, retirement income, short-term separate
capital gains, long-term separate capital gains, and capital gains of stocks.
The bottom panel of this ﬁgure shows the amount of income for each in-
come source. These ﬁgures show that the main income sources of high income
earners are wages and capital gains.

2.2 Change of distribution

The rank-size distribution of all acquired data is shown in the top panel of
Fig. 3. The gap found in this ﬁgure reﬂects the change of the income tax law.
We ﬁt distributions in the high income range by the power law distribution,
for which a probability density function is given by

p(x) = Ax

−(α−1),

where A is a normalization factor. Here α is called the Pareto index. The
small α corresponds to the unequal distribution. The change of α is shown by
the open circles in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. The mean value of the Pareto
index is ¯α = 2, and α ﬂuctuates around it.

It is recognized that the period of modern economic growth in Japan is
from the 1910s to the 1960s. It has been reported that the gross behavior of
the Gini coeﬃcient in this period looks like an inverted U-shape [18]. This
behavior of the Gini coeﬃcient is known as Kuznets’s inverted U-shaped rela-
tion between income inequality and economic growth [8]. This postulates that
in the early stages of modern economic growth both a country’s economic
growth and its income inequality rises, and the Gini coeﬃcient becomes large.
For developed countries income inequality shows a tendency to narrow, and
the Gini coeﬃcient becomes small. Figure. 3 shows that the gross behavior of
the Pareto index from the 1910s to the 1960s is almost the inverse of that of
the Gini coeﬃcient, i.e., U-shaped. This means that our analysis of the Pareto
index also supports the validity of Kuznets’s inverted U-shaped relation.

We assume that the change of the Pareto index in the 1970s is respon-
sible for the slowdown in the Japanese economic growth and the real estate
boom. In Fig. 3 we can also see that α decreases toward the year 1990 and

increases after 1990, i.e., V-shaped relation. In Japan, the year 1990 was the
peak of the asset-inﬂation economic bubble. Hence the Pareto index decreases
toward the peak of the bubble economy, and it increases after the burst of the
economic bubble. The correlation between the Pareto index and risk assets is
also clariﬁed in Ref. [16].

We ﬁt distributions in the low and middle income range by log-normal

distribution, for which the probability density function is deﬁned by

where x0 is mean value and σ2 is variance. Sometimes β
the Gibrat index. Since the large variance means the global distribution of the
income, the small β corresponds to unequal distribution. The change of β is
shown by the crosses in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. This ﬁgure shows that α
and β correlate with each other around the years 1960 and 1980. However, they
have no correlation in the beginning of the 1970s and after 1985. Especially
after 1985, β stays almost the same value. This means that the variance of the
low and middle income distribution does not change. We assume that capital
gains cause diﬀerent behaviors of α and β, and α is more sensitive to capital
gains than β.

1987 to 2000 (left) and a semi-log plot of them (right).

The top panel of Fig. 3 shows that the distribution moves to the right.
This motivates us to normalize distributions by quantities that characterize
the economic growth. Though many candidates exist, we simply normalize
distributions by the average income. The left panel of Fig. 4 is a log-log plot
of the cumulative distributions of normalized income from 1987 to 2000, and
the right panel is a semi-log plot of them. These ﬁgures show that distri-
butions almost become the same, except in the high income range. Though
distributions in the high income range almost become the same, distributions
of some years apparently deviate from the stational distribution. In addition
the power law distribution is not applicable to such a case. This behavior
happens in an asset-inﬂation economic bubble [6].

3 Modeling of personal income distribution

The empirical facts found in the previous section are as follows.

1. The distribution of high income earners follows the power law distribution,

and the exponent, Pareto index, ﬂuctuates around α = 2.

2. The main income sources of high income earners are wages and capital

gains.

3. Excluding high income earners, the main income source is wages.
4. The distribution normalized by the average income is regarded as the

stational distribution.

Hence, it is reasonable to regard income as the sum of wages and capital
gains. However, to model capital gains, we must model the asset accumulation
process. In the following we explain an outline of our model. Details of our
model are found in Ref. [12].

3.1 Wage process

We denote the wages of the i-th person at time t as wi(t), where i = 1
We assume that the wage process is given by

∼

N .

wi(t + 1) =

uwi(t) + sǫi(t)w(t)
w(t)

(cid:26)

if uwi(t) + sǫi(t)w(t) > w(t),
otherwise,

(1)

where u is the trend growth of wage, and reﬂects an automatic growth in
nominal wage. In this article we use u = 1.0422. This is an average inﬂation
rate for the period from 1961 to 1999. In Eq. (1), ǫi(t) follows a normal
distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, i.e., N (0, 1). In Eq. (1), s determines
the level of income for the middle class. We choose s = 0.32 to ﬁt the middle
part of the empirical distribution. In Eq. (1), w(t) is the reﬂective lower bound,
which is interpreted as a subsistence level of income. We assume that w(t)
grows deterministically,

w(t) = v

w(0).

t

Here we use v = 1.0673. This is a time average growth rate of the nominal
income per capita.

3.2 Asset accumulation process

We denote the asset of the i-th person at time t as ai(t). We assume that the
asset accumulation process is given by a multiplicative process,

ai(t + 1) = γi(t)ai(t) + wi(t)

ci(t),

(2)

−

where the log return, log γi(t), follows a normal distribution with mean y and
variance x2, i.e., N (y, x2). We use y = 0.0595. This is a time-average growth
rate of the Nikkei average index from 1961 to 1999. We use x = 0.3122. This is
a variance calculated from the distribution of the income growth rate for high
income earners. In Eq. (2), we assume that a consumption function, ci(t), is
given by

ci(t) = w(t) + b

ai(t) + wi(t)
{

w(t)
}

.

−

In this article we chose b = 0.059 from the empirical range estimated from
Japanese micro data.

3.3 Income distribution derived from the model

We denote the income of the i-th person at time t as Ii(t), and deﬁne it as

Ii(t) = wi(t) + E[γi(t)

1]ai(t).

The results of the simulation for N = 106 are shown in Fig. 5. The left panel
of Fig. 5 is a log-log plot of the cumulative distribution for income normalized

4 Summary

In this article we empirically studied income distribution, and constructed a
model based on empirical facts. The simulation results of our model can ex-
plain the real distribution. In addition, our model can explain the reason why
the Pareto index ﬂuctuate around α = 2. However there are many unknown
facts. For example, we have no theory that can explain the income distribu-
tion under the bubble economy, that can determine the functional form other
than the high income range, and that can explain the shape of the income
growth distribution, etc.

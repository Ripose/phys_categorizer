Abstract

Envy is a rather complex and irrational emotion. In general, it is very diﬃcult to
obtain a measure of this feeling, but in an economical context envy becomes an
observable which can be measured. When various individuals compare their posses-
sions, envy arises due to the inequality of their diﬀerent allocations of commodities
and diﬀerent preferences. In this paper we show that an equitable distribution of
goods does not guarantee a state of fairness between agents and in general that
envy cannot be controlled by tuning the distribution of goods.

Introduction

Envy is commonly deﬁned as a feeling with a negative character that aﬀects the
social relationships making it rather complicated to deﬁne and, therefore, to
measure. In economics this envy relation can be established as a phenomenon
that emerges after interpersonal comparisons between agents. From this point
of view envy can be considered as an economical observable that can be mea-
sured. We have developed a model with direct application in economics and
with potential applications in physics, in particular measurement problems,
which are related to conditional probabilities [11]. In this model we analyze the
emergence of envy in a network of agents with individual preferences according
to the restriction imposed by the preferences of the agents.

Previous investigations about similar systems are based on the development of
a single model that describes the dynamics between agents as the dynamics of
a network where the agents are in its nodes [2][3]. An equivalent concept has
been used by Donangelo et al. (2000) to model a network of trading agents as
an interaction rule [4]. The exchange between agents consist of goods as well
as information that can be quantiﬁed. In contrast to Donangelo’s model, our
motivation is to research interpersonal relations between the agents and to un-
derstand how the market motivates the evolution of these relations. This idea
has been studied some years ago with a ﬁnite number of agents and a ﬁnite
number of goods in economics without production; for instance, Schmeidler
et. al. (1972) made an analysis of the inﬂuence of prices into the envy relation
between agents [5]. This paper brings fundamental deﬁnitions to the concepts
of fairness, but depends on some trading properties for the agents and prices,
without consider the quality of goods or a fairness’ index. We do not model
envy as a network of trading agents related by envy relations. In contrast to
Schmeidler’s model, in the present case we analyze only the behavior of agents,
not the way they trade, as a function of parameters of allocation and the way
that agents compare in between. Because Emotions cannot be deﬁned in a
unique way, we develop a model that uses envy as a factor that modiﬁes the
conformation of a network based on information exchange. The exchange of
information is related to the behavior of envy in the system. We suppose that
an unidirectional exchange of information (each agent only observes her/his
neighbors) is made through perfect channels, that means there is no noise in
the transmission of information between agents. The existence of these chan-
nels ensure perfect comparisons, supposing that each agent has access to the
content of information, i.e., the kind and number of goods, assigned to other
agents. This situation can be imagined as a group of agents with television
set, an instrument to observe what other agents have, making them able to
compare their actual situation with the situation they look. A maximized al-
location must be Pareto eﬃcient where each agent is reaching the best stage
with its endowment (See for example Feldman and Kirman [8]). Otherwise,
the individuals search for a bigger allocation with a bigger welfare, motivated
for the possibility to get a bigger utility level reﬂected in their interpersonal
comparisons-. Given the diﬀuse deﬁnition of the notion of envy, we present
in the second part the fundamental concepts and theory from an economical
point of view. In the third part we explain the fundamental schemes and ideas
in the formulation of our model. In the fourth part we show the principal
results and in the ﬁfth part we explain the main conclusions obtained in this
investigation.

2 Fundamental economical concepts

In economics the ﬁrst concept of equity, as no-envy, is due to Foley (1967) [6],
introducing the concept of envy-free allocations: an allocation is equitable (or
envy-free) if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to his own. In this
case we can say, there is a situation with fairness deﬁned as no-envy.

The simplest problem of fairness is that of dividing a homogeneous commodity
among a set of agents with equally claims on it. In this case, equal division (or
equal income situation) is clearly the appropriate solution. If we want to have
eﬃciency of this type of allocation and preserve its property of symmetry, the
concept of fairness must be redeﬁned. An equilibrium state is deﬁned here as
the moment when each person chooses the most preferred bundle in his budget
set, and the choices exhaust the available supply.

An allocation is fair if it is envy-free and eﬃcient [10]. An allocation in a
walrasian equilibrium with equal-income is fair in this sense, but the converse
no longer holds at all. A walrasian equilibrium is deﬁned as a state where
the aggregate excess demand (sum of all individual demands minus sum of all
individual supplies) is equal to zero. So, if a bundle bi′ is preferred by agent i
to the bundle bi then the excess demand is diﬀerent to zero. Hence, when the
agents have equal initial endowments and equal possibilities in market, they
can easily reach their maximal utility getting a fair trade [5].

A distribution of goods is said to be envy-free when no one prefers anyone else’s
bundle of resources to her own. The suggestion here is that envy is not the
psychological motivation for the concern with equality, but rather that, where
a distribution in fact produces envy, this is a reason to doubt the fairness of
the distribution. But envy in this context is a technical term for any situation
in which someone prefers another’s bundles of goods, and does not refer to
the emotional syndrome with which this entry is concerned.

3 Model

For the construction of our model we deﬁne three basic elements: the ﬁrst one
is a set of diﬀerent goods G located in a depot. Our second element is a set
of agents with a list of preferred goods (called preference lists); and the third
element is a set of individual ’baskets’ where the agents can deposit the owned
goods after she pick up them from the set of goods.

According to the individual preferences, the agents search them into the avail-
able set of goods. If the searched good is no more available, the agent starts

3

Fig. 1. Schema a system of agents (represented by cranes), each one with a preference
list, taking goods from a depot. Here N is the kind of goods, N G is the number of
goods. Some goods are more numerous in the depot. The broad of the distribution
of N G is A.

to collect the second good from its list and so on. Each agent projects the
goods from the set of goods into his/her basket. This situation is represented
in ﬁg. 1: a group of cranes enter into a depot and take some stored goods (for
example cakes, programs, movies, etc.); each good in the depot is classiﬁed
and has an etiquette with a number. Thus in the depot there are N ’kinds’ of
goods. There is no production of goods and the number of agents along the
process remains also constant. So, when the crane takes an object there is a
depletion of one good in the depot. The amount of each kind of goods in the
depot is called the number of goods (NG).

Here there are not only a single but a multiple set of goods that can be
assigned to diﬀerent agents. Furthermore each driver has particular individual
preferences, absorbing a group of goods, of a determined kind, according to the
individual preference ci. Each agent is allowed to pick up a maximal number of
goods ’MaxNG’. The acquired goods are grouped in diﬀerent states, according
to their diﬀerent characteristics.

In ﬁrst a ﬁst group of simulations we keep the number of goods NG equal for
each kind of good in the depot. In a second group of simulations we introduce

4

diﬀerences in the number of available goods depending on each kind of them .
In this case, NG in each kind of goods, is not equally distributed; we deﬁne a
distribution function for NG that depends on an amplitude parameter A. So,
an equal distribution means a broad distribution amplitude A, while a narrow
distribution is deﬁned for a particular kind of goods.

Fig. 2. Plot of the distribution of goods for two diﬀerent distribution amplitudes.
The N axis represents the kind of goods available for the agents and the NG axis
the amount of elements in each kind of good. A is the parameter associated to the
distribution amplitude of goods.

Following the rule of Knuth, we deﬁne the distribution of number of goods
like a gamma distribution

NG(N)[A] = (1 + (πN)2)e[(A

where the parameter G0 represent the point where the distribution is centered;
so, if G0 = 2 then the amount of goods of kind G = 2 is bigger than the
amount of goods G 6= 2. In this equation the parameter A is the amplitude of
the distribution, i.e. the variation of this parameter produces an equitable or
inequitable initial distribution of goods in the depot. The gamma distribution
has been used in a variety of settings, including the incoming distribution and
production functions [14] and for this reason it is reasonable to introduce this
function in our model. An example of the applied distribution is shown in
ﬁgure (2).

Fig. 3. Schema representing, how envy emerges among the agents, for three agents
with similar preferences. The arrows represents the times the agent looks other
agents. Here each agent makes three comparisons with other agents, i.e. f l = 3.
These three agents has a similar preference list, but one of them did not get the
preferred good. The envy relation to the other agents is represented by the bold
arrows.

After the distribution of goods the agents are allowed to take a look into the
baskets of other agents and compare the owned goods with their preferences
lists. Some agents are satisﬁed because they ﬁlled their preference lists, while
other individuals did not get the goods they set in their preference list. These
last ones search into the baskets of other agents for their preferred goods.
This situation is represented in ﬁg. 3. Under this restriction, when an agent
establishes visual contact with the basket of other agent, ﬁnding there the
searched good, then an envy relation emerges. An agent is allowed to make
several visual contacts f l in diﬀerent times, i.e. the search options for each
agent increase with the time (this is represented as the arrows around each
agent), but only a limited amount of this visual contact represent an envy
relation (bold arows). The search option f l increase with the time and is a
variable in the present system. This variable have in the present model the
same meaning as time in conventional Montecarlo simulations.

Our model could resemble a measurement process. In the notation we employ

6

brackets for the representation of probabilities related to diﬀerent agents. This
notation is, however, used only for convenience and has in principle no relation
with quantum mechanics. So, the projection of a good from the depot into the
basket is represented by

P |Oi = |bi,

b

where |Oi symbolizes the space of goods (total endowment of goods in the
system) and |bi the space of goods that are owned by the agent (the basket
space). The projection operator ˆP is deﬁned in the appendix at the end of
this article.

We have interest in the case when each agent has a particular preference. Such
preferences are represented by the so called ’space of preferences’ |ck
i i, where
the index i symbolizes the agent number and k the kind of preferences of this
agent. A relation of orthonormality is established between the preference list
and the basket for each agent. The acceptance or rejection of a good done for
each agent is therefore given by,

cp
i |bk
j
D

E

= δpkδij.

This result represents the amount of goods obtained by each agent (and in
general the determination of the total amount of goods) as a probability de-
termined on the condition |ck
i i. By substituting equation (2) into equation (3)
becomes a mechanism similar to the Born rule, which is commonly used for
the determination of probabilities in physics [12].

If eq. (3) is equal to zero it is possible to recognize a state of unfairness, because
the agent never becomes what he/she is searching for. It is assumed that after
the distribution of goods is done, the agents remain in the same space and
that each agent is allowed to make ”visual contact” with other agents. This
particular case could be the origin of the envy relation between agents. So,
when,

then a network of envy relations emerges. This network is represented as

the envy in the system. A typical snapshot of this network is represented in ﬁg

Fig. 4. Snapshot of a random Network of interpersonal comparisons in a system of
envious agents. The nodes in the network represents the agents. The edges between
nodes are the envy relation between agents. The I and J axis is the space where the
agents are (each axis is normalized).

(4). The nodes in the network are the agents-baskets and the edges between
nodes the envy relation established from one agent into the basket of other
agents.

The agents are rational in the way they choose the goods but are irrational in
the way they compare themselves with other agents in the room. Furthermore,
we assume that there is no particular diﬀerence between agents. Therefore, the
search of goods into the baskets of her/his neighbors occurs in a random way,
i.e. we deﬁne in our model a random network of comparisons between agents.
The deﬁnition of this random graph is done by using the so called G(n, f l)
model, that means, for a set of n nodes there are f l assigned edges [18].

The number of nodes (agents) is constant. An envy network is conditioned
to the projection of goods (assignation of goods) into the basket of the agent
subjected to her/his preferences and emerges only when the system is out of
a Walrasian equilibrium. Our model is not a typical optimization problem,
where an optimal pay-oﬀ function (free energy for instance) represents a kind
of equilibrium. Instead, the pay-oﬀ function (envy) is a measure of how far the
system is from the equilibrium state (how much envy is there). We analyze the

I

8

connectivity dependence on the assignation of goods and not on the number
of agents (nodes) in the network [13].

The fairness state, and not the topology of the network, is the main problem
in this investigation. We have particular interest in the measurement of the
amount of agents with envy. For this reason envy is redeﬁned in our model
as the total number of edges in the network averaged by the total number of
nodes (agents), i.e

hEi =

f li/NAg,

X

(6)

where NAg is the total number of agents. There is a fairness state when
there are no connections between the nodes of the random network, i.e when
hEi = 0. Otherwise, we recognize the emergence of an envy state.

This network represents the unidirectional exchange of information between
agents, i.e., each agent looks into the basket of the other agents searching for
the goods of her/his preference. Because they can look but not take out goods
from the basket of other agents, emerges an envy relation due to interpersonal
comparisons (or envy as no fairness).

Is it possible to improve the fairness by increasing the amplitude of the num-
ber of goods? At a ﬁrst glance this is a plausible way to get a very small
envy network between the agents. We want to probe this hypothesis making
a variation of the amplitude of the distribution of goods A.

According to the conventional deﬁnitions of fairness, an allocation is fair when
it is also symmetric [15]. Theoretically, when an asymmetry is presented two
diﬀerent states are generated: inferiority, because an agent unsatisﬁed wants
the object or good that the other have (object of envy) and, on the other
hand, superiority, because an agent possesses a good that the others want.
In this case the distribution of goods is controlled in the object space as
|Oi = |NG(N)[A]i.

Then, we require the times each agent looks their neighbors (used as a time
parameter), f l as a variable and the number of kind of goods, NG (number
of goods), which depends on the distribution amplitude of the number of
elements for each kind of good, A. The envy state is therefore described as

hEi = hE(f l)[NG(A)]i,

(7)

The number of agents NAG that express envy is also an observable of the
system. The advantage is the potential comparison of this observable with
results obtained using interviews in real agents. This observable depends on
the envy relation between agents and therefore is also dependent on f l and

4 Results

We performed simulations with 100 agents and 100 diﬀerent kinds of goods.
The total number of goods in the system is determined in a random way
governed by the gamma distribution. Each agent can observe the basket of
the neighboring agents, following the observation frequency parameter f l.

In a ﬁrst simulation we ﬁxed the maximal number of goods MaxNG = 10,
keeping f l constant. The distribution of envy hEi as a function of NG is
presented in ﬁg. (5). The envy relation grows according to the increment of
the number of contacts assigned to each agent f l. For large amounts of allowed
comparisons this result ﬁts with an exponential function, suggesting that envy
is a kind of a Boltzmann distribution among the network. This analogy makes

possible to relate NG with a kind of temperature of the system.

A ”non walrasian equilibrium state” is reached when the agents are allowed
to explore all the baskets of the other agents. A fair state cannot be reached
by increasing the supply of each kind of goods. This mechanism seems to be
very clear in a society, where envy is the motor that ensures consumption.
Innovation is related to the increment of the kind of goods supplied in the
market. This increment shows that, contrary to an stagnation, there is still a
tendency to increase the consumption. In other words, innovation makes the
role of a ”thermostat” in a consumption society.

The analysis of envy as a function of MaxNG is shown in ﬁg. (6). The in-
crement of MaxNG generates a logarithmic increase of envy. This trend (the
shape of the ﬁt) does not depends on the number of comparisons allowed be-
tween agents. This is an empirical law that expresses how an increment in the
allocated number of goods is not a guarantee for the improvement of fairness
into a set of agents. Now, the problem is to implement this situation in an
asymmetric distribution of goods.

Varian (1974) has demonstrated the existence of fair allocations [10]. Also Kant
(1797) was called for better allocations that lower or suppress envy [16]. As
we shown in previous paragraphs, we search for a fair allocation by controlling
the distribution of goods through the amplitude parameter A. The expected

result is a low envy relation by broadly distributed amplitudes in the number
of goods. These allocations must appear as fair allocations.

In order to test the role of the distribution of goods in the allocations we
ﬁxed the number of kinds of goods in 100 and repeated our simulations for
envy as a function of f l and A. Given that the system is closed ( there are no
change in the amount of goods and agents and no change in the preferences
is introduced) then for f l → ∞ the system must reach an equilibrium state
in the distribution of envious agents. This result is corroborated in ﬁg.7. In
these simulations the eﬀect of NG(A0), the variation of the mean amount of
each kind of good, and NG(A) in NAG is analyzed. The number of envious
agents is again small when the number of goods of each kind is big. So for
< NG(A) >≈ 300 the number of envious agents is around the 5% of the
total number of agents, whereas for < NG(A) >≈ 100 the number of envious
agents is approximately the 15% of the total number of agents. If the number
of goods is inﬁnite, and there are only few agents, then the number of envious
agents is zero (in other words, envy state is equal to zero).

The variation of A has eﬀect in the distribution function. This computation
was made for NG(A0) = 100 and 100 agents. For A = 5 the simulations
show a very asymmetric and narrow distribution of envious agents, while for

12

A = 80 the distribution of envious agents is signiﬁcantly broader. Therefore,
an uniform distribution increase the number of potential envious agents. This
result also means that a non symmetric distribution boost the number of
envious agents with particular preferences. We can interpret these graphics
under the light of a planiﬁed economy, for example in a post-war system
where the distribution of goods was rigorously controlled -and the number of
goods is comparable to the number of agents in the system- and a capitalistic
system. In the ﬁrst case, no matter how uniform is the distribution of goods,
the probability to ﬁnd an envious agent never decreases. In the second case
the narrow distribution of agents shows the way, how the initial distribution
of goods can be adapted in order to satisfy the demand.

5 Conclusions and remarks

The construction of models of agents with particular features is hard to im-
plement and set the problem presented in the Arrows impossibility theorem.
Furthermore the comprehension of the emotional (subjective) component in
a trading network is fundamental for the development of strategies in order
to understand economical systems. The model presented here is a static por-
trait in a stage equivalent to a thermodynamic equilibrium state for a closed
system where a set of agents, with individual preferences, are allowed to take
objects from an initial distribution of goods. The results show, under which
conditions the agents are not satisﬁed with the goods, they are able to ac-
quire. Two equilibrium concepts arising, one from the economical theory and
the other from the statistical mechanics. These equilibria are required for the
construction of the present model. From an economical point of view, this sys-
tem is far from equilibrium (deﬁned as a walrasian one, where the sum of total
demands must be equal to the sum of total supplies of the economy) when the
agents develop interpersonal comparisons. Here, the number of interpersonal
comparisons is equivalent to the magnitude of an envy ﬁeld. From the physical
point of view, the system reaches an equilibrium state (statistical equilibrium)
when the agents are able to make enough interpersonal comparisons in order
to explore the whole space of agents; after large number of interpersonal com-
parisons it is possible to quantify a distribution of envious agents that does
not change in the time. Furthermore, the existence of a statistical equilibrium
is tested by simulations, based on a Montecarlo method.

The number of envious agents depends on the number of possible comparisons
and the amount of available goods in the system. For very few visual contacts
between the agents the envy level is zero, and only after long interpersonal
comparisons time the system reaches a stable envy state (remember: we do
not consider time directly, but the parameter of frequency of comparisons f l
as a measure of time). Also when the number of agents is small compared to

13

the number of goods, the number of envious agents tend to be zero. These
results imply a simple conclusion: agents with very good allocations and no
visual contact with other agents does not have any chance to develop envy.

The control of the distribution over the number of goods is a way to control
the envy state among the agents. However, the results obtained in the present
calculations are quite contra-intuitive: a uniform distribution of goods does not
decrease and restricts the number of envious agents. Contrariwise, a uniform
distribution increases the distribution of the number of agents that feel envy.

This model appears like a caricature of a society of agents with feelings. We
show what could happen when the information of the preferences of the agents
is accessible and the interaction is ﬁxed. In contrast, in a real scenario each
agent can develop particular strategies in order to get the goods that they
want and improve their welfare, formally represented by means of her/his
own utility function. Furthermore, the opinion of an agent is not ﬁxed and
could change when is exposed to information that change her/his ’minds’. A
good example is a magazine about mode and superstars, oﬀering new goods
that change the preferences of the people and the market supply. Therefore,
an interesting perspective of this investigation could be consider an evolutive
panorama.

While in the system remain agents wanting to have the goods that other one
have, we show in the present results the impossibility to reach the desired and
ideal walrasian equilibrium state by controlling the distribution of goods in
the depot, when the number of goods is limited. That means, an equilibrium
in the statistics implies a non walrasian equilibrium. Models that far from the
equilibria could be considered by introduce changes on the amount of goods
or agents in the system, or with dynamical preferences sets for the agents,
which changes able to adjust the available goods to the preferences lists for
the diﬀerent agents, improving the walrasian equilibrium.

There are no production or waste of goods and therefore when a good is
picked up from the space of goods one element is eliminated in this space.
This operation is represented by a ’destruction operator’ on the space of goods

goods).By means of an iteration we want to explore the total distribution of
the goods between the agents, under the assumption that goods are succes-
sively absorbed in this society. Taking the expression (A.1) it is possible to

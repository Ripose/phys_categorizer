Abstract

An interesting example for collective decision making is the so-called Mexican wave
during which the spectators in a stadium leap to their feet with their arms up
and then sit down again following those to their left (right) with a small delay.
Here we use a simple, but realistic model to explain how the combination of the
local and global interactions of the spectators produces a breaking of the symmetry
resulting in the replacement of the symmetric solution – containing two propagating
waves – by a single wave moving in one of the two possible directions. Our model
is based on and compared to the extensive observations of volunteers ﬁlling out the
related questionnaire we have posted on the Internet. We ﬁnd that, as a function
of the parameter controlling the strength of the global interactions, the transition
to the single wave solution has features reminiscent of discontinuous transitions.
After the spontaneous symmetry breaking the two directions of propagation are
still statistically equivalent. We investigate also how this remaining symmetry is
broken in real stadia by a small asymmetrical term in the perception of spectators.

1 Introduction

In recent years, the rapid development of observational methods and computa-
tional power has made it possible to accumulate data on the collective motion
of a large number of living organisms [1] and to investigate the few observed
universal patterns of motion also by computational tools and statistical physics

based models [2,3,4,5]. Similarly to collective motion, the number of partici-
pants in collective opinion formation and decisions is often very large; a key
factor is interaction (inﬂuence and imitation) between the participants, which
strongly reduces the number of possible global patterns (see, e.g., Ref. [6])
suggesting that the number of relevant parameters is small. Statistical physics
based models have been successfully applied in the analysis of collective opin-
ion formation and decisions as well. Unanimous and undecided election results
and cooperation phenomena have been described by models containing parti-
cles with a small number of allowed states and simple rules of interaction plus
external ﬁelds [7,8,9,10]. Surprisingly, within the same modelling framework
one can explain the shape of the transition measured for the cumulated binary
decisions of millions of humans in several further collective decision processes
of high public interest, such as birth rate and cell phone purchases [11]. In
addition, by allowing the particles to move, one can model, e.g., the spatial
separation of opinions [12].

The Mexican wave (also called La Ola), is produced by spectators in a sta-
dium, and it is a well-known example of an instantaneous collective decision.
Since its direction of motion is spontaneously selected after a rapid collec-
tive decision based on information of limited complexity, it can serve as a
paradigm for similar processes. Below, we ﬁrst give an overview of general ob-
servations and data collected on Mexican waves in our online survey. This is
followed by a detailed description of the simulation model we have used includ-
ing its local and global versions and later the incorporation of the observed
additional left-right asymmetry. Our results on the spontaneous symmetry
breaking transition and the additional left-right asymmetry are in Sections 4
and 5. Additional calculations and the abbreviated list of data we have used
(from videos and our online survey) are provided in the Appendixes. Note
that the full data set is available in the preprint version of this paper from the
ArXiv.org server. The same complete data set together with our simulation
and evaluation programs can be downloaded from the supplementary website
of this paper at http://angel.elte.hu/localglobal.

2 Observations and data on Mexican waves

2.1 General observations

The Mexican wave is launched by a small group of people, each of them
standing up within a short time interval, raising their hands high above their
heads and then sitting down. As this motion is repeated consecutively by
groups of close neighbors, within a few seconds a stable, linear wave with
constant amplitude, width and speed develops. Among the reports known to

2

us (see Appendix C) the symmetric solution, i.e., two waves started by the
same source and moving in opposite directions, occurs rarely and only by
the coordinated action of an experienced group. In a stadium one source can
usually trigger only one wave moving either left or right, and the direction
becomes clear short after the initiation. The mechanism of this rapid self-
organizing process can serve as a paradigm for situations involving limited
interaction and the selection of one option out of a small number of possible
choices, e.g., route choice behaviour in vehicle traﬃc [13] or the selection of
exits during pedestrian escape panic [5].

While the Mexican wave rolls, spectators try to predict when the (nearest)
wave will arrive at their seats and leap to their feet at that moment. During
stationary propagation around the stadium, both the wave and its velocity are
well-deﬁned and spectators can easily synchronize themselves to the wave’s
arrival time. During the short time interval of the initiation, however, the
wave’s direction is not yet known. Those who can see that the region of active
persons is moving towards them will be more likely to participate than those
who ﬁnd that this region is moving away from them. In other words, a person
is activated by the combination of two eﬀects: (i) many of the neighbors are
already active and (ii) the nearest active region (wave) is approaching. The
ﬁrst is a short range eﬀect, while the second is a long range eﬀect.

2.2 Data on Mexican waves from videos and our online survey

We have evaluated 15 recorded waves from videos and used an online survey
to collect additional information about Mexican waves (see Appendix C for
details). The waves on the videos were all one-directional, 7 of them propa-
gating in the clockwise and 8 in the counter-clockwise direction. From the 75
visitors of our online survey 46 stated that the wave’s preferred direction was
clockwise (right to left), 18 that it was counter-clockwise (left to right), and
11 mentioned no preferred direction.

An optional question was the geographical location of the visitor. Interestingly,
the ratio of votes for clockwise vs. counter-clockwise was 32 : 12 from North
America and 5 : 0 from Europe, while the same ratio was 2 : 5 from Australia.
In addition, some visitors explained in detail that the direction of the wave
strongly depends on the relative position of initiators compared to each other
and the position of obstacles close to the triggering group (see, e.g., the answers
of visitors No. 29 and 73 to the question “Does the wave have a preferred
direction?” in Appendix C). The interaction between the spectators in the
stadium was claimed to be local, global or both by 15, 37 and 17 people,
respectively. From these answers we concluded that (i) usually the wave’s
motion is inﬂuenced by both short range (watching one’s neighbors) and long

3

range interactions (watching the wave as a whole), and (ii) in most cases an
additional left-right asymmetry is also present in the system.

3 Modelling the Mexican wave

As in Ref. [14] we apply an excitable medium model to describe the Mexican
wave with each particle representing one spectator in the stadium. However,
while in Ref. [14] we concentrated on the propagation of the wave, in the
present model we intend to capture the main features of the initiation pe-
riod. Our description is inspired by the Greenberg-Hastings (GH) model of an
excitable medium [15]. In the GH model at the beginning of the simulation
each particle is in the excitable (also called resting or activable) state. If at
time t there is a suﬃcient number of active particles among the ith particle’s
neighbors, then the ith particle becomes active (excited) at the next time step,
at time t + ∆t. After it has been activated, the GH particle deterministically
steps through the na active states, and then the nr refracter states before it
returns to its original, excitable state. A particle can be activated only if it is
in the excitable state, and only active particles inﬂuence other particles.

3.1 Simulation details

For the simulations, the stadium was folded out to a rectangular lattice with
Lx × Ly lattice sites (seats). Rows of seats became parallel to the x axis,
boundaries were periodic in the x direction and non-periodic in the y direction.
The positive x direction in this coordinate system corresponds to the clockwise
direction in the stadium, while the y axis is pointing out from the stadium.
Stadia for major sport events usually hold 20, 000 −80, 000 seats with 60 −100
rows; in the simulations we have used Lx = 400 and Ly = 80 (corresponding
to 32, 000 spectators) as a representative size.

In the simulations the excitable state corresponds to a person sitting and
ready to take part in the wave. Active states correspond to raising hands
when standing up. Refracter states represent sitting down plus the time in-
terval when the person is already sitting, but not yet activable again. In real
situations, in addition to the active and refracter states, there is a short, but
ﬁnite delay between the time when a person decides to move and the time
when he/she actually starts to move. This delay is due to one’s reaction time,
and we model it by inserting nd “delay” states between the excitable state
and the active states. In summary, in our model after activation a particle is
ﬁrst “waiting” for nd time steps, it is active during the next na time steps,
then refracter for nr time steps, and then it returns to the excitable state.

4

In one simulation update (one time step) the ith particle is activated with
probability 0 < p < 1, i.e., moved from state 0 (excitable state) to state
1 (delay state), if (a) it is currently in the excitable state and (b) the total
activation eﬀect, Wi, on this particle exceeds the activation threshold, C. The
total activation eﬀect, Wi, acting on the ith particle is a combination of local
(short range) and global (long range) interactions:

Wi = Gi

wj→i ,

j6=i
X
j active

where Gi is the global interaction strength for the ith particle and the sum
contains the local eﬀect, wj→i, of each nearby active particle, j, on the ith
particle.

In the simulations for each particle along the y = Ly/2 line, the time of the
particle’s ﬁrst activation, was saved as a function of the particle’s horizontal
coordinate, x. After triggering a wave the survival time, tS, of the wave was
deﬁned as the time below which the ﬁrst activation times showed an increasing
function when moving away from the initiating spot both left and right.

3.2 Local version of the model

If we ignore the global interactions in Eq. (1), i.e., we set Gi = 1 for each i,
then

This is the local version of the model. A simple form for an isotropic, expo-
nentially decaying local interaction with characteristic length R is

Wi =

wj→i .

P

In a deterministic case when spectators are identical, the excitable ith particle
is activated, if the sum, Wi, of the local weights exceeds the activation thresh-
old, C. On the other hand, the activation of spectators in a stadium – just like
most processes involving living systems – is not entirely deterministic. In the
present model this noisy component is taken into account by using a stochas-
tic activation rule for each person: the activation threshold, C, is the same for

5

(2)

(3)

each particle, but the activation of a particle is not deterministic. If for the
ith particle the total activation eﬀect, Wi, is above the activation threshold,
C, then this particle is activated in the current time step with probability p
(0 < p < 1). This gives a diﬀerent response times for each particle.

3.3 Global version of the model

Started with a small group of active particles, the above isotropic local version
of the model produces – after a transient circular wave phase – two symmet-
ric waves propagating in opposite directions away from the triggering center.
However, all video recordings available to us show and an overwhelming ma-
jority of our online visitors report that already short after the triggering event
only one wave is present. Therefore, an intriguing question is how one of the
two waves is suppressed and the other is selected so rapidly. The key eﬀect
in selecting the wave’s direction in the model so quickly is the long range in-
teraction: if the active region (perturbation, wave) is moving towards (away
from) a particle, then this will make the activation of that particle more (less)
likely.

To take long range interactions into account, we computed the average x
distance of active particles from the ith particle, x (a)
, using an exponentially
decaying weight factor:

i

x (a)
i =

(a) ∆xij e−∆xij/X
(a) e−∆xij/X

.

P

P

Here the horizontal distance between the ith and jth particles, ∆xij, is the
shorter of the two possible distances allowed by the periodic boundary. The
characteristic length of the long range interaction is X (X ≫ R), and the
summation goes for active j (j 6= i) particles. Denoting by v (a)
the time
derivative of x (a)
and by S the sensitivity of spectators to this velocity, the
i
long range interaction term is

Note that v (a)
– the velocity of the active region as seen from the ith person
– is positive, if the active region is moving away from this person, and it is
negative, if the active region is approaching the ith person. In the S → 0 limit,
Gi is a step function and the decision about the direction of the wave is very
sharp. In this case one of the two directions is selected quickly and the wave
in the other direction is suppressed, because particles on that side “measure”

a positive v (a)
, and, consequently, Gi = 0 and Wi = 0. In the S → ∞ limit
the global interaction term will be a constant, Gi = 1, which gives the local
version of the model (Eqs. (2) and (3)). In the 0 < S < ∞ case an approaching
wave, i.e., v (a)
i < 0, will make the ith person more likely to participate, while
a departing wave less likely.

3.4 Default parameter values

Simulation updates were parallel and synchronized, and the time step was
constant, 0.1s. We started each simulation by triggering a small group of
particles: for each particle inside a circle with radius ρ = 3 and centered at
(Lx/2, Ly/2), we selected a (discrete) time point randomly from the interval
(0s, 1s), and moved the particle at this time point from state 0 (excitable
state) to state 1 (delay state). The time derivative, v (a)
, was computed with
Euler’s formula and a time step of ∆t = 0.5s. If at time t for the ith particle
either x (a)
(t − ∆t) was not available, then the long range interaction
i
, was replaced by 1. Default parameter values were R =
coeﬃcient, Gi
3, X = 100, C = 0.23, p = 0.9, nd = 1, na = 10, nr = 20. Distances
were measured in seats, time was measured in seconds. To compute the local
weights, we applied a cutoﬀ and restricted the summation to |~rij| ≤ 3R.

4 Spontaneous symmetry breaking

In our model the relative weight of global interactions is given by S. In the
S → 0 limit one obtains the isotropic local version of the model, where the
stable solution contains two oppositely moving waves. Raising S causes a
spontaneous symmetry breaking (global interactions are “turned on”), and
the symmetrical solution becomes unstable. If S is high, then soon after the
initiation one of the two directions is selected and propagation in the other
direction is stopped. Thus, S changes the symmetry properties of the stable
solution and can be used as a control parameter. Figure 1 shows how at diﬀer-
ent values of S either two oppositely moving waves develop from one initiating
source or one of the two directions is selected.

Since the control parameter, S, tunes the stability of the symmetric solution,
we have selected an order parameter measuring this stability. For a wave start-
ing oﬀ asymmetrically at the triggering spot the survival time is tS ≈ 0. On
the other hand, for an inﬁnitely stable symmetrical solution the survival time
is a constant ﬁnite value corresponding to the time needed for the two waves
to meet at the opposite end of the stadium. The main panel of Fig. 2 shows the
distribution of tS values as a function of the control parameter, S. We found

spectator is represented as one particle in a rectangular lattice. Shown are parts of
the simulation area at 0.5s, 1.5s and 8s after the triggering event (see Section 3.4 for
the default parameter values). Excitable particles are colored dark. The increasing
color brightness of active particles represents the diﬀerent stages while standing up,
the decreasing color brightness of the ﬁrst 10 refracter states represents the stages
of sitting down, while the dark color of the remaining 10 refracter states indicates
that the person is already sitting, though not yet activable again. Left column. If

that for a range of S values the distribution of tS has two distinct peaks, which
is analogous to the distribution of the order parameter in the vicinity of the
transition point in systems undergoing a discontinuous transition. The two
phases are the symmetric solution with two waves (high tS) and the asym-
metric solution, a wave moving either left or right (low tS). Since the size of
the initiating group is always ﬁnite (in the range of a few dozen particles), the
phenomenon is inherently mesoscopic and the transition is not very sharp.

The inset of Fig. 2 shows the average of the order parameter, htSi, as a function
of S at diﬀerent values of the long range interaction length, X. The transition
point scales as X −1/2, and the transition becomes sharper with increasing X.
This scaling is caused by (i) the uncorrelated random activation of particles
– both in space and time – in the triggering group and (ii) the locally linear
shape of the global interaction term as a function of the horizontal coordinate
(see Eq. (5)). A detailed derivation of this scaling is provided in Appendix B.

5 Left-right symmetry breaking

The above description assumes that during the triggering of the wave, the
participating spectators stand up in an uncorrelated fashion. In real situations,
however, additional, very fast interactions are present, and the decision about
the direction of the wave is usually faster than predicted here. It is well-known

9

that people inside the triggering spot inﬂuence each other both before they
start moving and also during the very short time interval of the triggering.
From the responses to our online survey (see Appendix C) we found that
one important additional eﬀect inﬂuencing the wave’s direction and stability
is the local geometry, e.g., the presence of obstacles around the triggering
spot. Also, people tend to react asymmetrically to disturbances occurring on
their left and right sides; this is caused by our physiological asymmetry and
our expectations. If by a combination of these eﬀects people react stronger
to stimuli on, e.g., their left, than to those on their right, then a wave will
most likely propagate from the left to the right, which is the counter-clockwise
direction in the stadium when watched from above.

To model the inherent local asymmetry during the triggering, we extended
the global version of the model and changed Eq. (3). In the local coordinate
system of the ith particle let ϕ denote the angle of ~rij pointing from the ith
particle to the jth particle. If ~rij points to the left (the clockwise direction
when watched from above), then ϕ = 0, and for ~rij pointing radially out
from the stadium, ϕ = π/2. We used the following direction-dependent local
interaction term (compare to Eq. (3)):

wi→j = K −1

i

e−|~rij|/R [(1 − δ) + δ cos (π − ϕ)] .

(6)

Similarly to Eq. (3), Ki is a normalizing constant chosen such that for the ith
particle the sum of wi→j (j 6= i) values is 1.

In the model, “switching on” the left-right asymmetry of local interactions has
two simultaneous eﬀects. (i) The balance between left and right moving waves
will be broken (see the main panel of Fig. 3): by increasing δ the probability
of the right moving wave, PR, will be dominant over the probability of the left
moving wave, PL. (ii) The spontaneous symmetry breaking transition will be
shifted (inset of Fig. 3). The inset of Fig. 1 shows that for all values of X, the
transition point of the spontaneous symmetry breaking is at approximately
SC(X) = 2(X/100)−1/2. This is the value of S, where the average survival
time of the symmetric solution (two waves), htSi reaches half of its maximum
value. However, with the same S values and δ > 0, the survival time of the
symmetric solution becomes signiﬁcantly smaller, i.e., the symmetric solution
is destabilized by the left-right asymmetry term.

Observe that in both cases the transition curves collapse when plotted as a
function of δX 1/2, i.e., the transition point, δC, scales with the global inter-
action length as X −1/2. This is the same scaling as the one that we have seen
earlier for SC in the spontaneous symmetry breaking, and it has the same two
reasons (see Appendix B for a detailed derivation): the random activation of
particles in the triggering spot is uncorrelated and the left-right asymmetry
term is a locally linear function.

Conclusions

We have presented a simple realistic model of an instantaneous collective hu-
man decision process, where the interplay of local and global interactions leads
to a spontaneous symmetry breaking. The decision we have modelled concerns
the direction of propagation of the Mexican wave (La Ola) in a stadium after
a small group of people stands up to initiate the wave. Although the situation
and the model we have considered is relatively simple, they give an insight
into the mechanisms by which quick decisions are made by groups of people.
Understanding such phenomena is important in various contexts including
the spreading of excitement in panicking crowds or during collective actions
of humans at gatherings and during collective ﬁnancial decisions.

Appendix B. Scaling of the transition point in the spontaneous sym-
metry breaking

To interpret the SC ∼ X −1/2 behaviour (see the inset of Fig. 2) consider the
ith particle, just outside the initial activation spot (a circle with radius ρ). The
horizontal (x) distance of this particle from the center of the spot is ℓ. When
the simulation is started, the ith particle is aﬀected by the active particles, j,
inside the spot. Since |∆xij − ℓ| ≤ ρ ≪ X, the exponential weight function in
Eq. (4) can be approximated with a linear function:

x (a)
i =

≃

During the initial triggering, activations occur with uniform spatial distribu-
tion inside the spot, and also with uniform distribution in time. Moreover, the
expected distribution of ηij values is symmetrical around 0 at any time point.

Thus, the process of the summation of ηij values is always a random walk
around 0, and the expected sum is proportional to the square root of the lin-
ear scale of the summed values. The variable part of ηij is ∆xij/X, therefore,
the linear scale is proportional to X −1, and the changing part of the above
sum scales as X −1/2. Similarly, the changing part of the average, η, and the
expected rate of change of the average, d
dt η, are both proportional to X −1/2.
Diﬀerentiating Eq. (8) with respect to time gives v (a)

The above approximation for the speed of the active region, v (a)
, is valid only
during the triggering. The v (a)
i ∼ X 1/2 proportionality means that (i) the
decision process is slightly faster for a larger global interaction length and (ii)
with a weak global interaction (X → 0) there is no spontaneous symmetry

Appendix C. Data on Mexican waves

Evaluation of recorded Mexican waves (videos)

Table 1 lists the 15 recorded Mexican waves we have evaluated: 14 of them
were waves rolling among the spectators in stadia and indoor halls built for
athletic events and holding up to 50, 000 spectators, while 1 of the waves (the
ﬁle is called sportwav.MPG) was performed on a sports ﬁeld by a group of
approximately 50 children. On all videos only one wave – moving in one of the
two possible directions – can be seen, in 7 cases it was a clockwise wave and
in the remaining 8 cases it was moving in the counter-clockwise direction.

Answers collected in our online survey

We have set up an online survey on Mexican waves at http://angel.elte.hu/wave.
→ select SURVEY in the top right corner. The answers to this survey between
July 2004 and August 2005 are listed below. The question about the geograph-
ical location of the visitor was added in September, 2004. A detailed evaluation
of the answers is given in Section 2.2 above.

I would tend to anticipate the movement, but would move at the same time as my immediate neighbors. Im the wave-
zealous type who wants to keep it going as long as possible.

Yes. Ive been in the small group trying to start one. It was not the size of the group, but the density that seemed to
matter.

left or giht will rise depending upon the direction they want it to go , and then the bloke next to him will rise, followed
by the guy next to him. Then everyone follows.

All waves I have been in have been clockwise, right to left.

I initiated a wave with a group of about ten friends at an Oakland Athletics baseball game in Oakland, California,
USA in 2004. The ten of us attempted to start a wave twice before strangers in our local area noticed and joined in the

initiation. By the fourth time the Wave was successfully launched to our joy.

* Does the wave have a preferred direction? (Clockwise or counter-clockwise?)

No its dependent on where the initiator, (i.e. the person lively enough to want to start the wave), sits in relation to
his friends. Since it cant be started by one person, not notifying a few people in row beforehand, the intiator will more
than likely get the people he knows at the furthest end to where hes sitting start it. Therefore it is dependent on the
intiators position among his friends.

Yes on a trip to Yankee Stadium New York(although Im Irish).I was there in a big group of international students I got
on well with. Proudly it was my idea to start it and yes the direction was pretty much set out since we got a few of us in
a row to do it. I remember we did it a few times since the ﬁrst didnt get a reaction. The second time I think there was
one random guy who did it and we cheered him. Then since I presume people around us were catching on to what we
were doing the third time it went to the end of the stadium. Now I say end of the stadium because Yankee Stadium(a
base ball stadium) is a crest shape i.e. its not a complete circle. Regardless I think a lot of people were starting to see
the little waves and a lasting wave was started (sadly not by myself but somewhere else). This wave when it reached
the side of the stadium the other side kept it going and around and around it went. I still feel I laid the ground work
for this lasting wave though.

In a medium-sized stadium, I have been able to start a wave with as few as one other person. We werent trying to go
a certain direction, but we must have inﬂuenced it because we were next to each other and we stood up at separated
times. It only seems to work if something has happened in the game that causes happiness in most of the spectators.

Yes. At the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor I experienced waves like none other I have experienced. It always
starts in a clockwise direction and at one point, through coordinating hand signals, the wave will change. There are
four potential changes. One is to speed up the wave such that it is nothing more than a quick ﬂash of the hands in the
air. The second is a slow down of the wave such that it appears it is moving in slow motion. The third is to reverse the
direction of the wave, and the fourth is to split the wave into two opposite-moving directions. This type of wave can be
witnessed at almost any University of Michigan football game. The coordinators of the changes are an informal group
of students located at the front of the student section of the 110,000-person football stadium.

Yes, my friends and I tried to initiate a wave once. Six of us were sitting together, but we couldnt have done it without
some nearby wave enthusiasts who noticed right away what we were doing. They helped us out, and timed their cheers
with ours.It took several attempts before we got the attention of enough people! I guess there were about a dozen of
us at the very beginning. We ﬁnally did end up trying to inﬂuence the direction of the wave - one of my friends ended
up getting out of his seat, and ran down the aisle yelling and waving his arms. Then he quietly went back to where he
started, and ran back the other way again, yelling and waving. The wave started to build up a few times, but always
died quickly. Suddenly, it seemed to hit critical mass - enough people had noticed what we were trying to do, and our
wave rounded the stadium three or four times.

I considered the motion fo the wave as a whole. If you follow your neighbors your reaction is too slow thereby putting

Always started by counting down slowly - and as loudly as possible - from 5. First two or three people (usually schoolboys
or fairly drunken fans!), or a larger group of friends, would start counting, then others would join in as the count got
down to 1. Successful waves started with a roar.

yes me and my friend to the left repeatedly jumped up with our arms straight up and made a whoah sound. While I
would say there was not a conscious eﬀort to send the wave one way or the other (because I think my friend and I both
assumed for whatever reason that it would naturally go clock-wise), I suppose our looking left could have inﬂuenced
the beginning direction- though alternately, perhaps we only looked left because that is where it was picking up. ???

Yes, the University of South Carolina Band (300 total members) initated a wave that went around the Williams Brice
Stadium at least 8 times. There were about 20-30 that initiated it, but we were in a group. We did start it on one side
and it picked up easily because we were in a large group of drunk college students. It was not done by all of the people
right when it started though because the people above us could not see that we were initiating it, but they caught it
the next time around. The only reason it stopped was because something really important happened in the game and
people stopped paying attention.

Yes, small waves during school events. A few of my friends & i would talk to the people around us & when enough
(more than half a dozen)would agree to participate in one, we would tell one side to start & then we would stand &
wait for the people next to us to go. By starting it we become the middle of the initial group so we call where it starts
by telling who to stand ﬁrst & then we follow & so on.

yes. It takes either a couple of very enthusiastice people or up to six people willing to help. I generally plant helpers in
the next sections of the stadium to help the wave continue. I have always tried to start waves in the counter-clockwise
direction by running with uplifted arms in the direction i wish the wave to proceed.

At Michigan Stadium, there is an entire sequence that occurs....ﬁrst a few rotations counter-clockwise, then it speeds
up, then slows down, switches to clockwise, then splits and two waves go simultaneously in two diﬀerent directions. its
amazing, really.

My experience is clockwise, but I was at a show recently where it was not a stadium and the wave started left to right
(from my left to my right) and then the people on the right of the audience triggered a reciprocal wave in the opposite
direction

Ive started a couple of waves. Typically I start with only a handful of people and then recruit those folks sitting near
us. Not consciously, but both times, I recurited people sitting to our left, therefore creating a clockwise wave.

We didnt really do much, we just yelled Una Ola!! una Ola!!!! (a wave!) and got up, and everyone followed. We indicated
as we yelled which way to go, and it came back to us as it ﬁnished on one side. It only took about ﬁve of us to start it.

Neighbour. THe moment he or she gets up, I start to. My imperfect reaction speed creates enough delay to continue to

The motion of the wave as a whole. In a baseball game, the focus of almost the entire crowd is on the wave, not on the
game. You cant help but follow the wave and anticipate its arrival. One of the things I noticed about your simulation is
that it will either die out immediately or propagate forever. My experience is that sometimes a wave will travel halfway
around the stadium before dying out completely. In terms of your model, the activation threshold varies in a systematic
manner (Usually the cheap seats have the easiest threshold, while the more expensive seats are harder to activate)

* Does the wave have a preferred direction? (Clockwise or counter-clockwise?)

It depends entirely on the person who starts it. I have seen waves go in both directions in the same stadium (at diﬀerent
events)

* Have you ever seen two waves initiated by a single source? (i.e., the wave leaving in both directions) If

No, since the person starting the wave indicates a preﬀered direction and either the wave follows him, or doesnt start
at all.

* Have you ever taken part in initiating a wave? What did you do? How many of you were needed? Did you

I have not started a wave myself, but I have been very close to and observant of those who did in several cases. It is
usually just one or two people near the front row of a section. He or they will stand up, turn around and try to get the
attention of the section he is sitting in, tell them they are going to do a wave, then count to 3. At 3 he raises his arms
up and to the side, and if he has room, he runs in the direction he wants the wave to go. It usually takes several tries.
If conditions are right, his section will react very well, but the wave will die out after travelling only a few sections.
People farther away just arent paying attention and dont notice the wave. After several attempts, the sections farther
and farther away start paying attention and the wave goes further before dying out. If the wave can make it through the
most heavily seated section with signiﬁcant energy, it will probably make it all the way around and be self-sustaining.
Sometimes it is the cheerleaders (in american college football games) who start it. They will run on the sidelines right
near the front row with a big ﬂag and start it. They usually take fewer tries to start a wave, but they are still rarely
successful on the ﬁrst try. I have seen waves in baseball stadiums and an american football stadium. Baseball stadiums
almost always have fewer rows of seats in the outﬁeld, and the most around home plate. Waves are usually started
by someone in the outﬁeld seats and sent towards home plate in whichever direction seems shortest. My local football
stadium has many fewer rows at one end zone (a U shape). Again, waves are usually sent in the direction of more seats.

I think its a function of the two. As I see it, in a normal stadium you are able to see very well the wave approach from
afar, but it is more diﬃcult to see where the wave is as it quickly approaches you. I considered the motion of the wave
as a whole for timing of when it would approximatly get to me and then I used my neighbours as the key signal as to
when I should stand.

* Does the wave have a preferred direction? (Clockwise or counter-clockwise?)

I think it depends on the stadium and the sparking group. My last wave experience it went counter-clockwise. Although
i could not see where it started, I think the sparking group was in the top level of left ﬁeld. There is a gap between
this area and right ﬁeld. The wave must go counter-clockwise if it is started there. It would be interesting to include a
description of the stadium and the location of the waves starting point in relationship to direction.

* Have you ever seen two waves initiated by a single source? (i.e., the wave leaving in both directions) If

No. I also think it would shorten the number of revolutions due to the law of deminishing returns.

We suggest that the geographical structure of networks have crucial inﬂuence on their percolation
thresholds, although these networks may have similar abstract topology structure. Then we propose
strategies of enhancing robustness of a geographic network (or constructing more robust networks)
and of immunization of a geographic network. Using the generating function formalism, we obtain
the explicit form of the percolation threshold qc for the small clustering coeﬃcient limit, which
might provide an analytical understanding for the strategies.

Complex networks (see reviews [1]) provide a powerful
tool to investigate complex systems in nature and society.
In many complex systems, the properties of networks are
aﬀected by the geographical distribution of the nodes,
for example, routers of the Internet and social networks
lay on the two-dimensional surface of the globe, neuronal
networks in brains occupy three-dimensional space, etc.
The transmission lines of power grid networks or the ca-
bles in Internet router networks are nearly always con-
necting the nearest spatial neighbors in order to reduce
the cost. So it is helpful to study the geographical com-
plex networks and it has attracted much attention re-
cently [2, 3, 4, 5].

In abstract geometrical viewpoints: an abstract set can
describe a general system, when some geometrical struc-
tures are added to the abstract set, the set can describe
a speciﬁed system. From this view, an abstract topology
network is an abstract set, consists of nodes and links,
and exists in a certain abstract space, devoid of metric.
Then, a metric can be added to the abstract topology
networks, here, the metric can be abstract, not only a
Euclidean metric. For example, in the citation network,
the metric may refer to how much the contents of two
papers correlate. For a particular abstract topological
network, embedding it into a suitable metric space could
be helpful to explore the network, e.g., the 2D global
metric can give a clear physical description for power
grid networks, Internet router networks and so on.

In this paper, we focus on the strategies of enhanc-
ing robustness and immunization in geographical com-
plex networks. Three kinds of geographical complex net-
works are investigated. The ﬁrst is the normal near-
est neighbor connecting model, as many authors have
considered [2, 3]; the second is a hollow model, in the
model there is a probability p of being forbidden to con-
nect their geographical nearest neighbors; the third is
a concentrated model, that is, long range connections
longer than a certain criteria depending on the degrees
are prohibited. By numerical simulations, the percola-
tion threshold qc can be inﬂuenced by their geographical
structures, qc(concentrated)> qc(normal)> qc(hollow).
Then we suggest a strategy (hollowing) of enhancing ro-

bustness of geographical networks: to redraw the edges
that have connected its nearest neighbors of a node to its
further neighbors. Complementarily, we suggest an im-
munization strategy (concentrating) for the geographical
networks: to cut down the edges to further nodes, leave
only those connected to the nearest neighbors. Finally,
we investigate the percolation threshold by a generating
function process in abstract networks, where cycles of or-
der 3 are considered. The analysis shows that the strate-
gies can be eﬃcient. Furthermore, the relation between
the percolation threshold and the clustering coeﬃcient
is discussed, and the theoretical analysis and computer
simulations are consistent.

Based on the lattice embedded model [2], we take the
geographical model as follows: (1) a lattice with peri-
odic boundary conditions is assumed; (2) for each node
in the lattice an integer k is assigned as the largest de-
gree it could have, a general distribution function of k
can be chosen. Here we take it as a power law one
k−λ, m 6 k (lattice embedded scale-free (LESF))
P (k)
k0 , m 6 k (lat-
or an exponential distribution P (k)
tice embedded exponential (LEE)); (3) a node is ran-
domly selected (say, i, with degree ki) from the lattice,
then, for the normal case, we connect node i to its closest
neighbors until its previously assigned degree ki is real-
ized, or up to a cutoﬀ distance A√ki(note that linking to
its neighboring sites is not always possible, in case that
the degree quota of the target site is already ﬁlled), where
A is large enough to ensure the degree quota can be al-
most ﬁlled, say, A = 7. For the hollowing case, node i
has probability p to start connections with its (n + 1)’th
nearest neighbor, then goes on with further neighbors,
and probability 1
p to be the same as that of the nor-

unless otherwise announces. This kind of networks will
be called hollow LESF (HLESF) or hollow LEE (HLEE)
networks due to degree distributions. For the concen-
trated case, A is set smaller than that in the normal case.
(4) the process is repeated throughout all the nodes in
the lattice.

where the diﬀerential of the size of the largest cluster as
a function of q peaks [7].
In our simulations, the net-
work size is 106, the minimum degree m is 4 for scale
free networks and 1 for exponential networks, and all the
data is averaged over 1000 ensembles, unless otherwise
indicates. Figure 1 shows a clear drop of the percolation
threshold qc in the hollow networks than in the normal
networks, for both the scale-free and exponential degree
distributions, and for both random failures and inten-
tional attacks, which testiﬁes the robustness of hollow
networks. The size eﬀect of qc for scale-free networks is
illustrated in Fig. 2. Similar to that proposed by Warren
et al. [3], the LESF and even the HLESF networks also
have non-zero percolation thresholds for λ lies in (2, 3).
Still, the drop in qc for hollow networks is apparent.

The amendment in hollow networks is small in view of
the physical space, as Fig. 3 shows, the average spatial
length
of the edges dose not increase much. When λ
is large for scale-free network or when k0 is small for ex-
ponential network, the average degree
is small, then
most edges are connected with nearest spatial neighbors
for normal networks or connected with second nearest
spatial neighbors for hollow networks, the diﬀerence be-
is almost 1; but when λ is small (the real situa-
tween
decreases,
tions) or k0 is large, the diﬀerence between
and in the limiting cases, goes to 0. Thus the cost of
constructing hollow networks still remains low, but they
are more robust than the normal model since under the
same conditions they have lower percolation thresholds
(see Fig. 1). This gives a general suggestion on con-
structing more robust real functional networks, such as
the Internet, the power grid network, etc., that arrange
the edges to connect neighbor nodes as far as possible.
Although it may cost a little more, it will stand a much
reduced risk in case of node failures.

FIG. 4: (Color online) Random percolation thresholds vs the
rearrange probability for LESF networks.

Figure 4 illustrates the eﬃciency of the hollowing strat-
egy for enhancing robustness of geographical networks.
The rearrangement of edges is carried out as follows: For
each node, it has probability p to cut down the edges that
linked to its ﬁrst n’th nearest neighbors, then reconnect

them to further nodes if they have not connected before.
In this case, the degree distribution deviates a little for
small k, i.e., around about 10. The strategy could be
usefull in case to maintain the global functions of real
world networks during some emergencies, such as the
epidemic occurrence, eruptions of electronical virus, or
cascade failures of power stations, etc.

FIG. 5: (Color online) Properties of concentrated networks.
Squares are the average degrees, circles are the random perco-
lation thresholds, and triangles are the clustering coeﬃcients.
The degree distribution assigned is scale free, with λ = 3.0.

For concentrated networks, since it mainly concerns
with geographical based immunization strategies [8],
we will focus only on concentrated scale-free networks.
When the cutoﬀ parameter A is small, the long range
connections are prohibited, thus the degree distribution
would deviate from the originally assigned one. We ob-
served that for λ = 3.0, when A is large enough that a
node i can connect more than its nearest ki neighbors,
the percolation threshold only varies a little, as shown
by Fig 5. This means that the long range connections
play a less important role in the LESF model than in
the small world models [9], since the long range con-
nections in the small world models can be really long,
as long as the largest spatial distance, but in the LESF
model, even the long range connections are somewhat lo-
cal. When A is small, the percolation threshold increases
almost linearly as A goes smaller, indicates that for the
concentrated networks (this is indeed the case during an
epidemic when most people are staying home or using
immune measures such as wearing respirators etc.), it is
much easier to be immunized. This could be caused by
the destruction of the network structure, which could be
illustrated by the transition of the average degree and
the clustering coeﬃcient for A around 0.5 (see Fig 5).

In [10, 11] a generating function process is applied on
the percolation problem of random networks (limits to
tree like networks for large network size), and obtains
the percolation threshold as the condition that the aver-
age cluster size diverges, or equivalently, the average size
of clusters that reached by following an edge diverges.

For uniform occupations (or random failures), the perco-
lation threshold is known as qc =
[10, 12].
For a network with non-zero clustering coeﬃcients, there
exist some triplets or cycles of order 3. If the clustering
coeﬃcient is small, the generating function process can
be extended to cope with the random percolation prob-
lems on such networks as follows.

For a uniform occupation probability q, the generating

The probability of the number of outgoing edges by fol-

if the two target nodes have a common edge, the number
of outgoing edges connected to new nodes reduces 2, thus
is generated by x−2F1(x)2. It is convenient to deﬁne

size distribution of the cluster that reached by following
two edges and when the two target nodes have a common

in Fig. 6, in which the networks used in simulation are
generated using a rewiring process [14] on random graphs
with the prescribed degree distributions. For hollow net-
works, they have more edges connecting to new nodes
instead to inter-connect the existed nodes in a cluster;
while for concentrated networks, the percentage of inter-
edges increases. This could contribute to the shift of
the percolation thresholds in the hollow and concentrated
networks (Fig. 1 and 5). Figure 7 displays the clustering
coeﬃcient C for both normal and hollow networks. The
decrease in C for hollow networks is clear, which is con-
sistent with the drop of the percolation threshold qc for
such networks.

FIG. 7: (Color online) Clustering coeﬃcients of the networks.

for large C, or when the network has highers order cycles,
which has less inﬂuence than triangles [15], the percent-
age of inter-edges will further increase, thus the percola-
tion threshold will be even higher. This means that when
a network is more clustered, it will be less robust. In view
of epidemic spreading, the more clustered network will be
easier to be immunized.

In short, we have studied the inﬂuence of the geograph-
ical structures to the percolation behavior of complex
networks. When a network is densely connected in view
of geography, it will be sensitive to either kind of percola-
tion. When it is loosely connected, it will be more robust.
Thus for geographical networks, we suggest strategies of
constructing robust networks or making a network more
robust and of immunization. And analytical understand-
ings are provided by generating function formalism.

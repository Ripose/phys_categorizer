We show here that the Pareto power law distribution observed in an ideal gas-like trading market
model (with random saving propensity of its agents) and the Gutenberg-Richter like distribution for
the overlap measure between two Cantor sets (as one moves uniformly over the other in a dynamical
model of earthquakes) have a common origin. The identiﬁcation of this common generic origin helps
in developing generalized views and understanding of such diverse phenomena.

PACS numbers: 87.23.Ge;89.90.+n;02.50.-r,05.45.Tp

Recently we have shown that a Pareto tail [1] in the in-
come (m) distribution

P (m) ∼ m−(1+ν); ν = 1

(1)

in a trading market model [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] occurs, for
m → ∞, when in an ideal gas like model [3] each agent
is identiﬁed with a gas molecule but having a (random)
saving propensity (λ) and each trading as an elastic or
money conserving collision. The steady state money dis-
tribution in the model is Gibbs-like for λ = 0, Gamma
distribution [2, 4] for ﬁnite λ and have got a Pareto
tail with ν = 1 for most of the analytic distributions
of λ among the agents [5]. In another model of earth-
quake [9], where one Cantor set (representing, say, the
rough fractured surface cross-section of the earth’s crust)
moves with uniform velocity over another (representing,
say, the relatively moving tectonic plate; fractured sur-
face cross-section), the contact area or overlap s (between
the two sets) distribution D(s) between the two sets have
a Gutenberg-Richter like power-law variation:

D(s) ∼ s−γ; γ = 1.

(2)

In both the cases, we get simple power law behavior
(ν = γ = 1). Although they have been derived sepa-
rately in the two models, employing both numerical and
analytical methods, we show here a common feature in
the two models and the precise (common) origin of the
power law in the resulting money or overlap distribu-
tions in the models. The derivation here indicates that a
common logarithmic interval in m or s in the respective
models, with a more or less ﬂat distribution otherwise,
results in the above power laws.

THE MARKET MODEL

Let us consider the ideal-gas model of a closed eco-
nomic system where total money M and total number of
agents N is ﬁxed. No production or migration occurs and
the only economic activity is conﬁned to trading. Each
agent i, individual or corporate, possess money mi(t) at
time t. In any trading (see Fig. 1), a pair of traders i and

j randomly exchange their money [2, 3, 4, 6], such that
their total money is (locally) conserved and none end up
with negative money (mi(t) ≥ 0, i.e, debt not allowed):

mi(t) + mj(t) = mi(t + 1) + mj(t + 1);

(3)

time (t) changes by one unit after each trading.

We have already shown that the steady-state (t → ∞)

distribution of money is Gibbs one:

P (m) = (1/T ) exp(−m/T ); T = M/N.

(4)

when there is no restriction in the traded amount apart
from (3). When each agent saves a ﬁxed fraction λ (1 ≤
λ < 1) of its money at anytime and λ is uniform for
all the agents [4], a Gamma distribution appears in the
steady state.

When we consider the eﬀect of distributed savings,
Pareto law appears [5] in the income distribution. The
evolution of money in such a trading can be written as:

mi(t+ 1) = λimi(t)+ ǫij [(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj (t)] ,
(5)

mj(t+1) = λjmj(t)+(1−ǫij) [(1 − λi)mi(t) + (1 − λj)mj(t)]

(6)
where λi and λj being the saving propensities of agents i
and j. The agents have ﬁxed (over time) saving propensi-
ties, distributed independently, randomly and uniformly
(white) within an interval 0 to 1; agent i saves a random
fraction λi (0 ≤ λi < 1) and this λi value is quenched for
each agent (λi are independent of trading or t).

Starting with an arbitrary initial (uniform or ran-
dom) distribution of money among the agents, the mar-
ket evolves with the tradings. The average steady state
money distribution is found to follow a strict power-law
decay. This decay ﬁts to Pareto law with ν = 1 [5, 8]
(see inset of Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 shows the numerical result for money distri-
bution Pλ(m) for diﬀerent λ, when one selects all the
agents with a ﬁxed value of λ from the ensemble (of dif-
ferent λ’s) and averages over them. As one can see, the
agents with λ → 1 are responsible for the Pareto tail and

FIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the trading process: agents

respective money (before trading), changing over to mi(t + 1)
and mj (t + 1) after the trading has taken place.

they also share the maximum of the money in the market
in general.

We now have rigorous derivations [2, 7, 8] of the Pareto
distribution in this random-saving gas model [5], starting
from scattering calculations of the transport contribu-
tions and solving them in the steady state. Here, we give
a simple derivation of the asymptotic result (1). Since
(see Fig. 2) the Pareto tail is contributed here essentially
by the agents who save a high fraction of their existing
wealth (λ → 1), the second term in (5) or (6) disappears.
The money redistribution equations then become simple

random variable, but ﬁxed (over time t) for i-th agent.
However, for the i-th agent, the partner j in the trad-
ing/scattering process in (5) changes in time (λj ≡ λt).
If we multiply therefore (5) and (6) in the large λ limit,
we get

(mimj)t+1 = λiλt(mimj)t

Denoting log(m2) by x, eqn. (7) can be rewritten (in this
limit of λ’s) as:

x(t + 1) = x(t) + δ,

where δ (= log λiλt and 0 ≤ λi, λt < 1 and λt changing
over time t) is a random number. As such, the map
equation (8) is that of a random walk and therefore the
distribution for the ‘displacement’ x in time τ will be
given by

However, as the relaxation time τ for the stationar-
ity of the distribution in such models scales with N , the
number of agents in the market, and N → ∞, the expo-
nential term in (10) becomes a very weak function of m
and one gets

THE FRACTAL OVERLAP MODEL OF
EARTHQUAKE DYNAMICS

Next, as a geometric model [9] of the stick-slip dy-
namics between the (rough, fractured) tectonic plates,
we consider here the overlap sets of two identical frac-
tals, as one slides over the other (representing the tec-
tonic plate motion). Study [9, 10, 11] of the overlap
distribution P (s) for the overlap set s deﬁned at vari-
ous (sliding) positions of the two fractals gives (2). In
particular, the distribution D(s) for two regular Cantor
sets (at ﬁnite generation n; see Fig. 3) shows [9, 10] a
Gutenberg-Richter type behavior (2) and with extrapo-
lated (n → ∞) exponent value γ = 1.

Bhattacharyya [11] has recently studied this distribu-
tion for two Cantor sets with periodic boundary con-
ditions and each having dimension log 2/ log 3.
It was
shown, using exact counting that if s ≡ 2n−k (n is the
generation number) then the probability ˜D(s) to get an
overlap s is given by a binomial distribution [11]

which, together with the appropriate measure of the in-
terval ∼ d(log s), reduces to the Gutenberg-Richter law
(2). In both the cases, while the original (Gaussian or
binomial) distributions became very weak functions (of
m and s respectively) because of the scaling by inverse
of N (number of agents in the market) or by inverse of
n (number of generations in the Cantor set), the choice
of appropriate interval leads to the respective power laws
(1) and (2). These derivations clearly indicate the uni-
versality of the exponents ν = 1 = γ. In particular, the
Gutenberg-Richter exponent value γ = 1 in (2) is seen
to be clearly independent of the fractals employed and
should be of much more generality. It may be mentioned
that a somewhat similar common origin for the laws of
Benford and Zipf was noted recently by Pietronero et al
[12].

Noting that ˜D(s)d(log s) ∼ D(s)ds, we again ﬁnd D(s) ∼
s−γ, γ = 1, as in (2). It may be noted that this exponent
value γ = 1 is independent of the dimension of the Cantor
sets considered (here log 2/ log 3).

It may be mentioned here that this d(log s) interval
in comparing
was missed from the consideration [11]
˜D(s) with D(s) and the Gutenberg-Richter like power
law (2) did not appear in the results. This consideration
clearly restores comparisons with the earlier renormaliza-
tion group [9] and numerical [10] results.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In the trading market, we show that the money ex-
change equations (5) and (6) reduce to random stochastic
map (7) in the limit of high saving propensity, where the
money accumulates, as shown by earlier numerical stud-
ies. Using the transformation x = log(m2), the above
map equation (7) could be reduced to that of a ran-
dom walk and hence the distribution reduces to Gaus-
sian one. This, together with the proper measure of the
interval d(m2) the distribution P (m) becomes (1) in the
large m limit. In the two-fractal overlap model, the over-
lap distribution is given by a binomial distribution (12) ,

The distribution of numbers in human documents is determined by a variety of diverse natural and
human factors, whose relative signiﬁcance can be evaluated by studying the numbers’ frequency of
occurrence. Although it has been studied since the 1880’s, this subject remains poorly understood.
Here, we obtain the detailed statistics of numbers in the World Wide Web, ﬁnding that their
distribution is a heavy-tailed dependence which splits in a set of power-law ones. In particular, we
ﬁnd that the frequency of numbers associated to western calendar years shows an uneven behavior:
2004 represents a ‘singular critical’ point, appearing with a strikingly high frequency; as we move
away from it, the decreasing frequency allows us to compare the amounts of existing information
on the past and on the future. Moreover, while powers of ten occur extremely often, allowing us
to obtain statistics up to the huge 10127, ‘non-round’ numbers occur in a much more limited range,
the variations of their frequencies being dramatically diﬀerent from standard statistical ﬂuctuations.
These ﬁndings provide a view of the array of numbers used by humans as a highly non-equilibrium
and inhomogeneous system, and shed a new light on an issue that, once fully investigated, could
lead to a better understanding of many sociological and psychological phenomena.

Already in the early 1880’s, Newcomb [1] noticed a
speciﬁc uneven distribution of the ﬁrst digits of num-
bers, which is now known as Benford’s law [2]. The
observed form of this distribution indicates the wide,
skewed shape of the frequency of occurrence of numbers
in nature [3, 4, 5] — for illustration, and to clarify the
question, note that in these ﬁrst two sentences the nu-
merals 1, 2, 3, 5 and 1880 all occur twice. Benford’s law is
directly derived by assuming that a number occurs with a
frequency inversely proportional to it, meaning that the
frequencies of numbers in the intervals (1, 10), (10, 100),
(100, 1000), etc. are equal. Yet, this assumption lacks
convincing quantitative support and understanding, in
part due to scanty data available. In our days, this prob-
lem can be tackled by resorting (with the help of search
engines) to the enormous database constituted by the
World Wide Web.

One should note that the profoundly wide form of the
distribution of numbers in human documents is deter-
mined by two sets of factors. The ﬁrst includes gen-
eral natural reasons of which the most important is the
multi-scale organization of our World. The second are
‘human factors’ including the current technological level
of the society, the structure of languages, adopted nu-
meral and calendar systems, history, cultural traditions
and religions, human psychology, and many others. By
analyzing the occurrence frequency of numbers we can
estimate the relative signiﬁcance and role of these fac-
tors.

man documents, allowing us to eﬀectively study their
statistics by using search engines, which usually supply
the approximate number of pages containing the Ara-
bic numeral that we are looking for. In this respect, the
WWW provides us with huge statistics. Yet, the frequen-
cies of occurrence of distinct kinds of numbers are very
diﬀerent [6]: for example, one can see that 777 and 1000
occur much more frequently than their neighbors (Table
I). Here we report on the markedly distinct statistics of
diﬀerent types of natural numbers (or, rather, positive
integers) in the WWW documents, collected through the
currently most popular search engine [7]. We consider
separately (i) powers of 10 and (ii) non-round integers,
and ﬁnd that in both of these cases, the number N (n)
of pages containing an integer n decays as a power law,
n−β, over many orders of magnitude. The ob-

inverse proportionality for their frequency of occurrence.
Note that previously scale-free (i.e. power-law) distri-
butions were observed for processes in the WWW [8, 9]
and its structural characteristics [10, 11]. However, and
in contrast to these studies, we use the WWW as a
database for measuring one of the basic distributions in
nature. In order to explain the observed distributions, we
treat the global array of numbers as a non-equilibrium,
evolving system with a speciﬁc inﬂux of numbers, and, as
a reﬂection of this non-equilibrium nature, we ﬁnd a ‘crit-
ical behavior’ of N (n) in the neighborhood of n = 2004
(the current year at the time the measurements were
made): near this point, the frequency of WWW docu-
ments follows a power law, N (n)

n)−α.

(2005

Finally, we show that the statistics of variations of the
frequencies of WWW pages which contain close numbers
of the same kind, dramatically disagrees with the stan-
dard distribution of statistical ﬂuctuations. We observe,
namely, that the amplitude of these variations, δN (n), is
much greater than what would be expected for standard
statistical ﬂuctuations. Consequently, the frequencies of
pages containing diﬀerent numbers ﬂuctuate not inde-
pendently, these ﬂuctuations being a reﬂection of those
of the inﬂux of numbers.

Current-year Singularity

In the second week of December 2004, we obtained the
frequency of WWW documents corresponding to positive
integers n in the range between 1 and 100,000 (Fig. 1a).
This plot contains a set of regularly distributed peaks,
which indicate that diﬀerent types of numbers occur with
very unlike frequencies. For example, the number of
documents containing round (ending with 0) numbers is
much higher than that for non-round numbers. Further-
more, the special number 2004 occurs with a remarkably
high frequency: 3,030,000,000 pages. For comparison,
among 8,058,044,651 WWW pages covered by the used
search engine, a single character string a occurs in about
8,000,000,000 pages, while the numbers 0, 1 and 1000
occur in 2,180,000,000, 4,710,000,000 and 154,000,000
pages, respectively. The high, asymmetric peak of N (n)
around n = 2004 (Fig. 1b) is naturally identiﬁed as the
contribution of documents containing numbers associ-
ated to years; below n = 2005, this peak can be ﬁtted

ity of 2004, N (n) increases with n much faster than the
total number of pages in the WWW grows with time,
which indicates that there are many pages with numbers
associated to years that disappear from the WWW (or
at least, are updated) after a while. Indeed, our observa-
tions prove that the amount of pages holding a number
n < t (where t is time measured in years) in the region of

amounts of pages with non-round numbers taken from rela-
tively narrow intervals (50 numbers). Each interval is centered
at the hni coordinate of a circle. The dashed line has slope
−1.3. Note that the power-law behavior is observed over 6
orders of magnitude. Non-round numbers occur much less
frequently than powers of 10, which explains the essentially
narrower range of numbers in this plot than in Fig. 2a. For
instance, presently, and as far as search engines report, there
are no WWW documents with the number 12345789013.

and, contrastingly, (ii) non-round numbers (i.e.
those
with a non-zero digit in the end) which are, on aver-
age, the most indistinctive ones, therefore occurring with
the lowest frequencies. It is worth remarking that, even
though the non-round include many peculiar numbers,
such as 777 for example, we ﬁnd that their contribution
does not change the statistics noticeably.

n−β, where β = 0.50

The strikingly high frequency of occurrence of pow-
ers of 10 in the WWW allows us to obtain the statistics
for numbers up to 10127 (Fig. 2a), a range that is re-
stricted by the limited size of strings being accepted by
the used search engine (128 characters). Two distinct re-
gions are seen in the distribution. The region of relatively
‘small’ numbers, up to 1011 (Fig. 2b), is of a power-law
form, N (n)
0.02, hence close to

1/√n ; note that this exponent is much

smaller than 1 and far smaller than the values of the ex-
ponents of typical Zipf’s law distributions [11, 12], these
being mostly in the range between 2 and 3. For com-
parison, the occurrence frequencies of a character string
baaa . . .a of varying length were also measured, a quite
diﬀerent, far from straight line, dependence having been
observed (Fig. 2c). For n larger than 1011, we observe an
extremely slow decrease of the frequency of occurrence of
pages containing powers of 10 (Fig. 2a). It is worth not-
ing that the crossover between these two regimes turns
out to be rather close to the maximum 32 digit binary
number, which is about 0.4

1010.

The slope of the dashed line is −0.5. We emphasize that the

tinct classes (Fig. 1a), is a slowly decreasing dependence.
Nevertheless, it can hardly be ﬁtted by any power law
because it is, in fact, the result of the superposition of
distributions of distinct kinds of numbers, which, in turn,
are power laws having diﬀerent exponents. In order to
proceed, we then compare the statistics of the WWW
documents which hold two ‘extreme’ types of numbers:
(i) powers of 10, which should occur with the highest
frequencies due to the common decimal numeral system,

4

instead, we explain the reason for the unusual small val-
ues of exponents which we observed — β = 0.5 and 1.3
(Figs. 2b and 3), while typical Zipf’s law exponents are
2 and greater. At least, Zipf’s law exponents must take
values greater than 1. At ﬁrst sight, this diﬀerence seems
surprising, since the mechanisms of the power laws are
quite similar. But, importantly, these two sets of expo-
nents are deﬁned for diﬀerent distributions. In our non-
traditional case, the observed power law describes the
behavior of the frequency of WWW pages with a given
natural number n, namely N (n)
In contrast,
typical Zipf’s law exponent γ occurs in a power law for
a quite diﬀerent quantity: in our terms, this quantity is
the amount, m(N ), of distinct numbers, where each of
them occurs in every of N Web pages. So, we have the
N −γ. One can show that the exponents

β and γ satisfy a simple relation, β = 1/(γ
1) [18]. As
a result, if the γ exponent is greater than 2, which is typ-
ical for simple linear growth processes, the β exponent is
smaller than 1, as in Fig. 2b. On the other hand, non-
linear growth may produce exponents γ below 2, which
gives β greater than 1, as in Fig. 3.

there is only one factor in the evolution of the array of
numbers which can break the statistical independence of
ﬂuctuations, namely, the variation of the inﬂux of num-
bers. So, the observed proportional law proves that the
variations of the occurrence frequencies of numbers are
an outcome of the ﬂuctuations of their global inﬂux in
the WWW.

Discussion and Conclusions

These observations suggest a new view of the array
of integers in the WWW (and in nature) as a complex,
evolving, inhomogeneous system. The statistics of num-
bers turns out to be far more rich and complex than one
might expect based on classical Benford’s law. More-

the frequencies of pages containing non-round numbers versus
their mean values, hN i, on a log-log plot. The data (circles)
were obtained resorting to the same intervals as in Fig. 3.
Next to each circle the average (non-round) number, hni, for
the corresponding interval is indicated. The dashed line has
slope 1. One can see that phN 2i − hN i2 ≈ 0.1hN i for hN i >
103.

For properly measuring the occurrence frequency of
non-round numbers, we use a set of intervals selected
in their wide range, each of which having a width of 50
numbers, so that the relative variation of the frequency of
WWW pages inside a speciﬁc interval is suﬃciently small.
In addition, these intervals are chosen far from the powers
of 10, whose close neighborhood includes numbers, such
as, for instance, 1009, that occur more often and whose
distribution does not follow a clear power law. Within
each of these intervals, we take the average values of n
and N (n), and denote them by
, respectively;
i
the resulting dependence (Fig. 3) has a prominent power-
law region with exponent β = 1.3
0.05, which strongly
diﬀers from that ascertained for powers of 10. As num-
bers grow, the ratio of the amount of WWW documents
with powers of 10 to that with non-round numbers in-
creases, following the n0.8 dependence.

A few mechanisms generating power-law distributions
[12] are known [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Most of these mech-
anisms explain power laws as a result of a speciﬁc self-
organization of a non-equilibrium system, and we treat
our observations in the spirit of these approaches. Evi-
dently, the array of numbers in human documents is an
evolving system, and the stochastic growth of this array
is due to a permanent inﬂux of numbers, added with new
documents. The added numbers (among which may also
occur new distinct ones, that were not employed pre-
viously) are chosen from a distribution which is deter-
mined by the one for the existing numbers. Here we do
not discuss a speciﬁc model exploiting this mechanism
and generating the observed complex distributions, but,

5

over, our ﬁndings provide a tool for extracting meaning-
ful information from statistical data on the frequency of
occurrence of numbers. As an illustration, consider the
two integers, 666 and 777, with clear associations. We
ﬁnd that these numbers occur in the WWW with fre-
quencies of 11,800,000 and 13,600,000 pages, respectively,
which are 1.25 and 1.65 times higher than, on average,
the occurrence frequencies of their non-round neighbors.
These deviations are to a great extent higher than what
one would anticipate from the relative amplitude of ﬂuc-
tuations, 0.1. Therefore, we can reasonably compare the
amounts of pages containing 666 and 777 obtained after
subtracting the numbers of pages holding the neighbors
of these two integers. These subtractions give 2,400,000
and 5,400,000 pages for 666 and 777, respectively. It is
the diﬀerence (or, rather, the relative diﬀerence) between
the two last amounts that should be used as a starting
point for a subsequent comparative analysis. The pro-
posed approach is very suggestive. Indeed, by analyzing
the frequencies of occurrence of speciﬁc ‘popular’ num-
bers with clear interpretations one could evaluate the rel-
ative signiﬁcance of the corresponding underlining factors
of this popularity.

Many more questions lie ahead: How do the occur-
rence frequencies of speciﬁc numbers vary in time? How
do diﬀerent numbers correlate and co-occur in WWW
documents? It is well known that humans can easily
memorize only up to rather limited sequences of digits

[22, 23], which are, therefore, many times replaced by
words (like, for instance, the IP addresses of computers).
Then, how does the statistics of numbers relate to the
organization of human memory and to semantics? Our
ﬁndings quantitatively show the key role of the common
decimal numeral system — a direct consequence of the
number of ﬁngers. How do other numeral systems (the
binary system, for example) inﬂuence the general statis-
tics of numbers?

The global array of numbers is surmised to be a “nu-
meric snapshot of the collective consciousness” [6]. So,
the study of their statistics could lead to a better under-
standing of a wide circle of sociological and psychologi-
cal phenomena. The distribution of numbers in human
documents contains a wealth of diverse information in
an integrated form. The detailed analysis of the general
statistics of numbers in the WWW could allow the eﬀec-
tive extraction and evaluation of this hidden information.

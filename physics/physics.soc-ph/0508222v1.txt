Understanding widely scattered traﬃc ﬂows, the capacity drop, platoons, and
times-to-collision as eﬀects of variance-driven time gaps

We investigate the adaptation of the time headways in car-following models as a function of
the local velocity variance, which is a measure of the inhomogeneity of traﬃc ﬂow. We apply
this mechanism to several car-following models and simulate traﬃc breakdowns in open systems
with an on-ramp as bottleneck. Single-vehicle data generated by several ’virtual detectors’ show
a semi-quantitative agreement with microscopic data from the Dutch freeway A9. This includes
the observed distributions of the net time headways and times-to-collision for free and congested
traﬃc. While the times-to-collision show a nearly universal distribution in free and congested traﬃc,
the modal value of the time headway distribution is shifted by a factor of about two in congested
conditions. Macroscopically, this corresponds to the ’capacity drop’ at the transition from free to
congested traﬃc. Finally, we explain the wide scattering of one-minute ﬂow-density data by a self-
organized variance-driven process that leads to the spontaneous formation and decay of long-lived
platoons even for deterministic dynamics on a single lane.

INTRODUCTION

One of the open questions of traﬃc dynamics is a mi-
croscopic understanding of the observed wide variations
in the time-headway distributions [1, 2] that are closely
related to the wide scattering of ﬂow-density data in
the congested regime [3, 4], see, e.g., Refs. [5, 6] for an
overview. Apart from their wide variations, the aver-
age values of the time headways depend strongly on the
traﬃc density. For congested traﬃc, the modal value,
i.e., the value where the distribution has its maximum,
is larger by a factor of about 2 compared to free traf-
ﬁc. Figure 1(a) shows a typical example obtained from
single-vehicle detector data of the Dutch freeway A9 from
Haarlem to Amsterdam.

With the increasing availability of single-vehicle data
[1, 2, 7], further statistical properties of traﬃc became
the subject of investigation such as the velocity variance
as a function of the traﬃc density [8], or the distribution
of the times-to-collision (TTC), which plays an important
role for traﬃc safety [9, 10].

In this paper, we therefore propose a variance-driven
adaptation mechanism, according to which drivers in-
crease their safety time gaps T when the local traﬃc
dynamics is unstable or largely varying. This adapta-
tion is, e.g., reﬂected in the empirically observed increase
of the variation coeﬃcient V = θ/¯v and oﬀers a safety-

oriented interpretation of the capacity drop, i.e., the sig-
niﬁcant reduction of traﬃc ﬂow when it becomes unstable
[11, 12, 13].

Variance-driven time headways can also qualitatively
explain the distribution of times-to-collision, which is sur-
prisingly invariant with respect to density changes (com-
pared to distance, time gap, or velocity distributions).
Times-to-collision are, therefore, not only an interesting
measure for traﬃc safety, but also a meaningful variable
of behaviorally-oriented traﬃc models based on the phys-
ical approach of invariants [14, 15].

The variance-driven increase of the safety time gap
T may also be seen as an alternative to a frustration-
driven increase of T after a long time in congested traﬃc
[2, 16, 17, 18]. Moreover, it potentially overcomes the
criticism of traﬃc models with a fundamental diagram
by Kerner [6], as it causes a pronounced platooning eﬀect
when traﬃc ﬂow is perturbed or unstable. This guaran-
tees a wide gap distribution which is the main prerequi-
site to reproduce the wide scattering of ﬂow-density data
in congested traﬃc [3, 4].

Previous explanations of the wide scattering of ﬂow-
density data include stochastic eﬀects [19, 20], and sus-
tained non-equilibrium states caused by dynamic insta-
bilities such as stop-and-go traﬃc [16]. Stochastic terms
are included in most cellular-automaton traﬃc models
[21, 22] and also in some car-following models, e.g., in
the Gipps-model [19] or in recent car-following models
proposed by Kerner [23] or Wagner [24]. Another expla-
nation of the scattering is based on the heterogeneity of
vehicles (such as cars and trucks) and driving styles (such
as defensive or aggressive) [12, 25, 26]. However, while all
these eﬀects can possibly account for the observed vari-
ations of time headways and times-to-collision, at least
for a given traﬃc density, the scattering of ﬂow-density

data would be smaller than observed due to the aver-
aging implied in aggregating single-vehicle data to, e.g.,
one-minute data [4].

In the next section, we will introduce the mechanism
of variance-driven time headways (VDT) in terms of a
’meta-model’ which can be applied to a wide range of
car-following models. Section III introduces a general
method to add ﬂuctuations to car-following models. In
Sec. IV, we apply the VDT mechanism to three micro-
scopic traﬃc models and compare ’virtual-detector data’
directly with empirical ﬁndings. We found that this sim-
ple mechanism can semiquantitatively explain all the mi-
croscopic and macroscopic empirical ﬁndings mentioned
above. In the concluding Sec. V, we discuss the eﬀects of
the VDT mechanism in terms of a spontaneous formation
and decay of vehicle platoons, and point to applications
in the ﬁeld of traﬃc control and driver-assistance sys-
tems.

II. VARIANCE-DRIVEN ADAPTATION OF
THE TIME HEADWAY

We will formulate the variance-driven time headways
(VDT) model in terms of a meta-model to be applied to
any car-following model where the time headway T0 for
equilibrium traﬃc can be expressed by a model parame-
ter or a combination of model parameters.

The basic assumption of the VDT is that smooth traﬃc
ﬂow allows for lower values of the time headway than
disturbed traﬃc ﬂow where the actual time headway

T = αT T0

(1)

≥

is increased with respect to T0 by a factor αT
1. Fur-
thermore, we characterize disturbed traﬃc ﬂow (such as
stop-and-go traﬃc) by relatively high values of the veloc-
ity diﬀerences between following vehicles. Since a driver
in vehicle α must assess the heterogeneity of traﬃc ﬂow
in situ, any measure for the heterogeneity may only de-
pend on the immediate environment. One of the simplest
measure satisfying this requirement is the local variation
coeﬃcient

where the local velocity average

the sake of simplicity we will skip the vehicle index α
here, and in all subsequent equations. In this work, we
will set n = 5 in most cases, i.e., the adaptation of the
drivers is assumed to depend on the own velocity and the
velocities of the four nearest vehicles in front.

This quantity can be empirically determined if single-
vehicle data are available. Figure 1(c) shows an example

for the Dutch freeway A9 between Haarlem and Ams-
terdam. Notice that, for a given local density ρ, the
variation coeﬃcient Vn = √A is related to the variance
prefactor A(ρ) introduced in the macroscopic gas-kinetic-
based traﬃc (GKT) model [8].

Let us now assume that the multiplication factor αT of
the time headway is adapted instantaneously to a traﬃc
situation according to

αT = min (1 + γVn, αT sup max) .

(5)

Here, αT sup max denotes the maximum multiplication
factor for the time headway for traﬃc ﬂows of maximum
unsteadiness, and

γ =

(6)

the sensitivity of the time headway to increasing velocity
variations.

In summary, Eqs.

(2) - (5) imply that the neces-
sary time headway for safe driving depends on the ve-
locity variance of the surrounding traﬃc. This propo-
sition of variance-driven time headways (VDT) can be
applied to any time-continuous car-following model in
which the time headway can be expressed by a model
parameter or a combination of parameters. Some ex-
amples are the optimal-velocity model (OVM) [27], the
velocity-diﬀerence model (VDIFF) [28], the intelligent-
driver model (IDM) [29], or the Gibbs model [19].

The VDT has three parameters, namely the number n
of vehicles used to determine the local velocity variance,
the maximum multiplication factor αT by which the time
headway is increased compared to perfectly smooth traf-
ﬁc, and the sensitivity γ. For the special case n = 2, the
VDT acceleration depends only on the velocity diﬀerence
to the immediate predecessor, i.e., one obtains a sim-
ple car-following model depending only on the immediate
predecessor (at least, if this is the case for the underlying
car-following model). However, the model yields more re-
alistic results for a larger number of vehicles, therefore we
will assume n = 5 in all simulations (see Table I). Larger
values for n will not change the dynamics signiﬁcantly.

The parameters αT and γ can be determined from em-
pirical data of the time-headway distribution for free and
congested traﬃc, and from the observed maximum vari-
ation coeﬃcient Vn sup max. Figure 1 shows these data
for the Dutch freeway A9 from Haarlem to Amsterdam
[2]. Figure 1(a) shows that the locations of the maxima
(modal values) of the time-headway distributions for free
and congested traﬃc diﬀer by a factor of about two. We
therefore set αT sup max = 2 in all simulations. The pa-
rameter γ can be determined by the approximate relation

throughout this paper for all simulated car-following mod-
els. The strength of the acceleration noise (cf. Sec. III) was
set to 0.1 m2/s3.

III. ACCELERATION NOISE

Fluctuating forces in microscopic traﬃc models are
used to globally describe all inﬂuences that are not mod-
eled explicitly such as imperfect estimation capabilities
[14], lack of attention, or simply the fact that drivers
do not always react identically to a given traﬃc situa-
tion. Fluctuation terms are part of nearly all cellular
automata (the most popular example being the Nagel-
Schreckenberg model [21] and models derived from it
[30]), but are less commonly used in time-continuous car-
following models.

Since the VDT is essentially based on ﬂuctuations of
the velocity, it is to be expected that purely deterministic
underlying models yield unrealistic results due to the lack
of an initial source triggering the ﬂuctuations. Therefore,
we consider additional acceleration ﬂuctuations when ap-
plying the VDT to a deterministic model.

For simplicity, we will just add a white (independent
and δ-correlated) noise term [31] to the deterministic car-
following acceleration a sup (det)α according to

˙vα = a sup (det)α(t) +

Q ξα(t).

(8)

Here, Q denotes the ﬂuctuation strength (cf. Table I),
and the white noise ξ(t) is assumed to be unbiased and
δ-correlated:

eﬀects of the ﬂuctuation term on the velocity, we note

that

It turned out that the deviations between F sup num(v, t)

that, for suﬃciently small time steps δt, the result is
independent from δt and agrees with the analytic solution
to the stochastic diﬀerential equation (8).

We have checked this for the random walk and linear

good agreement between the numerical results from the

discussion).

(see Ref.

In summary, Eqs.

(8) - (12) can be considered as
a general approach to add acceleration noise to time-
continuous deterministic car-following models. Clearly,
δ-correlated noise terms are unrealistic in many respects.
Therefore, we have also simulated more realistic time-
correlated and multiplicative noise, which clearly de-
scribes the human origins of acceleration noise better [14],
but we found no qualitative diﬀerence.

In the following, we will apply the VDT to three
car-following models, namely the intelligent-driver model
(IDM) [29], the optimal-velocity model (OVM) [27], and
the velocity-diﬀerence model [28], which augments the
OVM by a term proportional to the velocity diﬀerence.
We will also simulate heterogeneous traﬃc consisting of
a mixture of these models.

For the purpose of reference and in order to discuss
the coupling to the VDT, we shortly present the model
equations, i.e., the acceleration functions, of these mod-
els.

The IDM acceleration ˙vIDM(s, v, ∆v) of a vehicle as a
function of the (net) distance s to the predecessor, the
velocity v, and the velocity diﬀerence ∆v (positive when
approaching) is given by

The coupling (1) of the VDT to the IDM is simple, since
the desired time headway T is already an IDM parame-
ter. We used T = T0 = 0.7 s as minimum value which
can be increased up to T = 1.54 s corresponding to
αT sup max = 2.2 (cf. Table I). To ﬁnd an appropriate
coupling of the VDT to the OVM and VDIFF models,
we note that the parameter L deﬁnes a typical interac-
tion range and, consequently, the desired time headway
s/vopt(s) is essentially proportional to L/v0 in these mod-
els. Therefore, we coupled the VDT to the OVM and the
VDIFF models by setting L = L0αT with αT according
to Eq. (5).

In order to distinguish between freely moving and fol-
lowing vehicles, we need at least two vehicle types (’cars’
and ’trucks’) with diﬀerent desired velocities v0. For all
models, we have set v0 = 35 m/s for ’cars’, and v0 = 25
m/s for ’trucks’ and simulated a truck percentage of 20%.
Notice that v0 is a common parameter of all three mod-
els. Because we want to introduce as little complexity
as possible, we did not distinguish cars and trucks with
respect to other parameters. Furthermore, we used the

same vehicle length lveh = 5 m for both vehicle types in
all simulations.

The remaining IDM parameters are the minimum gap
s0 = 3 m, the acceleration a = 1 m/s2 , and the comfort-
able deceleration b = 1.5 m/s2 . For the OVM, we used
the relaxation time τ = 0.4 s and the form factor β = 1.
Furthermore, we set the interaction length L0 = 13 m
for cars and L0 = 10 m for trucks. Thus, the eﬀective
time headway is about the same for both types. For the
VDIFF, we used the same values for L0 and β as for
the OVM. Furthermore, we used τ = 2 s and the sensi-
tivity coeﬃcient λ = 1 s−1. For all models, we set the
ﬂuctuation strength Q = 0.1 m2/s3. For comparison, we
simulated also the deterministic VDT-IDM for which the
ﬂuctuation strength is Q = 0. The parameters were cho-
sen such that the traﬃc dynamics was comparable to the
Dutch freeway A9 freeway data with respect to the form
of the fundamental diagram, capacity, and stability.

We have simulated a single-lane road section of total
length 15 km with an on-ramp of length Lrmp = 200 m
located at xrmp = 12 km (Fig. 2) from which a constant
ﬂow of 400 vehicles/h merges to the main road. To keep
matters simple, we have avoided explicit modeling of the
merging of ramp vehicles to the main road. Instead, we
have inserted the ramp vehicles centrally into the largest
gap within the 200 m long ramp section. In order to gen-
erate a suﬃcient velocity perturbation in the merge area,
the speed of the accelerating on-ramp vehicles at the time
of insertion was assumed to be 50% of the velocity of the
respective front vehicle. It turned out that the perturba-
tions induced by the slower merging vehicles were crucial:
When simulating merges with the same velocity as the
main road vehicles, the onset of traﬃc breakdown was
markedly delayed indicating the role of perturbations for
traﬃc optimization (see Sec. V below).

We initialized the simulations with very light traﬃc of
density ρ = 3 vehicles/km and an initial velocity of 100
km/h. The details of the initial conditions, however, are
not relevant unless they lead to an immediate breakdown
of traﬃc ﬂow. To generate congestion, we have increased
the inﬂow of vehicles to the main lane linearly from 300
vehicles/h at t = 0 s to 3000 vehicles/h at t = 2400
s. Afterwards, we decreased the inﬂow linearly to 300
vehicles/h until t = 4800 s. In case the inﬂow exceeded
capacity, we delayed the insertion of new vehicles at the
upstream boundary.

The update time step of the numerical integration
scheme was δt = 0.05 s for all models. Runs with smaller
time steps yielded essentially the same results.

investigations of single-vehicle data have
shown that the distributions of net time headways diﬀer

•

The modal value (location of the maximum of
the probability density) of the time headway is
markedly higher (about twice as high for the VDT-
IDM) in congested traﬃc compared to free traﬃc.

•

The values for Tα form a broad and asymmetrical
distribution.

•

The diﬀerent underlying models, particularly deter-
ministic and stochastic variants, yielded the same
qualitative results. Remarkably, the velocity vari-
ance depends only weakly on the noise.

Notice that the VDT only prescribes that the time head-
way increases with the variance. The dependence of the
variance (and thus the average time headway) on the traf-
ﬁc situation results from the traﬃc dynamics. Moreover,
all statistical data were obtained from identical vehicles
(the ’cars’). Since all cars have the same unique equi-
librium relation between velocity and net distance s, the
wide and bimodal distributions are an interesting result,
particularly for the deterministic case.

Nevertheless, the peaks of the simulated distributions
are higher and sharper that those in the empirical data
(cf. Fig. 1) The lacking quantitative agreement in this
case can be explained by the wide variation of individu-
ally preferred time headways of drivers, i.e., in the varia-
tions of the driving style [4], which was neglected in our
simulation for reasons of simplicity. To test this assump-
tion, we have simulated a mix of all three models. The
resulting time-headway distribution for congested traf-
ﬁc and the variance as a function of the density repro-
duces the observed data nearly quantitatively as shown
in Fig. 5.

For the sake of simplicity, we will, however, not incor-

porate heterogeneity in the rest of this work.

Further dynamic microscopic aspects of traﬃc can be
captured by the ’times-to-collision’ (TTC) τα sup T T C
which is deﬁned as the time interval after which a vehicle
α would collide with its predecessor provided no decel-
eration would take place. Negative TTC values denote
’virtual’ collisions in the past. We extract the value of
τ sup T T Cα from the single-vehicle data by the relation

τ sup T T Cα =

vα

vα−1 ≈

,

(19)

where sα is the net distance inferred from the data.

Instead of plotting distributions of the TTC directly,
we present, in Fig. 6, distributions of the inverse of the
TTC, which we denote as ’relative approaching rate’

rα = 1/τ sup T T Cα.

(20)

This has the advantage that the interesting range of small
positive and negative values of the TTC is magniﬁed and
there is no divergence for the equilibrium state, i.e., vα =
vα−1. We have obtained the following main results:

•

•

•

Both in the models and in the empirical data (cf.
Fig. 1), the distribution is nearly symmetrical with
respect to positive and negative values of rα.

For the OVM and VDIFF, the width of the dis-
tribution is nearly the same for free and congested
traﬃc, in agreement with the empirical data, while
the variance of the IDM distribution is too small
for free traﬃc.

For the IDM, the peaks of the distribution are lo-
cated at rα = 0 (i.e., equilibrium traﬃc is the most
probable state, in agreement with the data) while
the peak for congested traﬃc is shifted towards neg-
ative times-to-collision in the other two models.

V. DISCUSSION

7

In the variance-driven time headway (VDT) model put
forward in this paper, the desired safety time headway is
a dynamic variable increasing with the local velocity vari-
ance. This provides a mechanism for a spontaneous for-
mation and decay of long-lived but non-permanent pla-
toons: If traﬃc ﬂow is stable, initial velocity diﬀerences
decrease, leading to decreased values of the local variance
and thereby to low values of the desired time headway
and a high dynamic road capacity. Because of the conser-
vation of the vehicle number, this automatically leads to
platoons and to large gaps in front of the slowest vehicles
(’trucks’). For suﬃciently high traﬃc demands the short
time gaps may result in unstable traﬃc ﬂow, leading to
higher values of the variance. This, in turn, causes spon-
taneous braking maneuvers of the drivers which further
increase the velocity variance. Finally, this breaks up
the whole platoon resulting in a traﬃc breakdown with
a distinct capacity drop.

Our intention is to propose a simple model for this
variance-driver mechanism. Therefore, we have ne-
glected, e.g., ﬁnite reaction times or more elaborated con-
cepts of anticipation which are contained, for example, in
the human driver model (HDM) [14]. Furthermore, we
have modeled ﬂuctuations in the simplest possible way.
In the following, we want to discuss our main results

in the light of the ’VDT mechanism’:

•

•

•

The distribution of time headways in free traﬃc
is broad and asymmetric both in the determinis-
tic and stochastic cases, although all vehicles (cars
and trucks) have the same time-headway param-
eter. The reason is that the time headway de-
pends dynamically on the velocity variance. Conse-
quently, even the deterministic driver-vehicle units
do not have a unique fundamental diagram.

The averaged time headway in congested traﬃc is
almost twice of that in free traﬃc (Figs. 1 and 3),
which is related to the higher values of the velocity
variation coeﬃcient for congested traﬃc compared
to free traﬃc.

Apart from the IDM, the distribution of the relative
approaching rates (inverse of the times-to-collision)
is nearly independent of whether traﬃc is free or
congested. This is a result of several antagonistic
eﬀects: In congested traﬃc, the velocity correlation
rvα,vα−1 between neighboring vehicles, the variation
coeﬃcient V , Eq. (2), and the time headway T ,
Eq. (1), are all higher than in free traﬃc. In the
approximate expression for the standard deviation
of the relative approaching rate deﬁned in Eq. (20),

FIG. 7: Simulated ﬂow-density data of the VDT applied to
the IDM at two ’virtual detectors’ with a sampling interval of
Taggr = 60 s (a) with ﬂuctuations; (b) without ﬂuctuations;
(c) without ﬂuctuations and on-ramp vehicles merging with
the speed of the vehicles on the main road rather than half of
it as in (a) and (b).

•

On a macroscopic level, the VDT reproduces the
wide scattering of data points in the ﬂow-density
diagram calculated from one-minute data (Fig. 7),
and the capacity drop at the transition from free to
congested traﬃc (Fig. 7(a)).

8

In presenting our simulation results, we have emulated
the available data analogously to real traﬃc data. For
example, we did not use the full information of all vehi-
cle trajectories for plotting the spatiotemporal dynamics
of the velocity. Instead, we have restricted ourselves to
’virtual detectors’, as this approach allows a direct com-
parison with empirical traﬃc data.

We note that an understanding of the eﬀects of the ve-
locity variance is crucial for devising measures to avoid
traﬃc breakdowns: The VDT feedback mechanism is
triggered most likely near sources of sustained veloc-
ity variations, for example in the merging, diverging, or
weaving zones near freeway intersections, but also the
noise term plays a role. To illustrate that, we have intro-
duced a sustained velocity perturbation in all simulations
of Sec. IV and in Figs. 7(a) and (b) by letting acceler-
ating ramp vehicles merge with only half the velocity of
the vehicles on the main road. In simulations where the
ramp vehicles entered with the speed of the vehicles on
the main road, we observed a markedly delayed traﬃc
breakdown occurring only after a traﬃc-ﬂow peak near
3000 vehicles/h instead of 2500 vehicles/h, cf. Fig. 7(c).
The subsequent breakdown, however, was more severe
showing not only ’synchronized traﬃc’ but also jammed
traﬃc with nearly vanishing ﬂows. Eliminating the noise
term alone had a smaller eﬀect (Fig. 7(b)).

Thus, it is essential to avoid merging and diverging
maneuvers at high velocity diﬀerences, e.g., by increasing
the length of the acceleration lane at on-ramps and oﬀ-
ramps. Another measure to reduce the velocity variance
are speed limits which can be simulated with the VDT as
well. Furthermore, since lane changes constitute another
source of velocity variance, we expect a strong coupling
of lane changes to the longitudinal dynamics by the VDT
mechanism. In particular, a multi-lane generalization of
the VDT [33] might yield a fully quantitative explanation
of bottleneck eﬀects introduced by weaving zones and oﬀ-
ramps.

Finally, the distinct increase of the time headways
after traﬃc breakdown opens up vehicle-based options
to increase traﬃc performance and stability by means
of adaptive-cruise control (ACC) systems. Such driver-
assistance systems, which accelerate and brake automat-
ically depending on the distance to the preceding vehi-
cle and its velocity, are already commercially available
for some upper-class vehicles. By a suitable strategy for
varying the time headways of ACC systems as a function
of the traﬃc situation, the unfavorable human behavior
can be partially compensated for. First simulations of
such ACC-systems show promising results [34].

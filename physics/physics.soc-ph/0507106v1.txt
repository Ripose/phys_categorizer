We study the structure of the network representing the interurban commuting traﬃc of the
Sardinia region, Italy, which amounts to 375 municipalities and 1,600,000 inhabitants. We use
a weighted network representation where vertices correspond to towns and the edges to the actual
commuting ﬂows among those. We characterize quantitatively both the topological and weighted
properties of the resulting network.
Interestingly, the statistical properties of commuting traﬃc
exhibit complex features and non-trivial relations with the underlying topology. We character-
ize quantitatively the traﬃc backbone among large cities and we give evidences for a very high
heterogeneity of the commuter ﬂows around large cities. We also discuss the interplay between the
topological and dynamical properties of the network as well as their relation with socio-demographic
variables such as population and monthly income. This analysis may be useful at various stages in
environmental planning and provides analytical tools for a wide spectrum of applications ranging
from impact evaluation to decision-making and planning support.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The informatics revolution has enabled the systematic
gathering and handling of a large array of large scale net-
works data sets, enabling the analysis of their detailed
structural features.
In particular, mapping projects of
the WWW and the physical Internet oﬀered the ﬁrst
chance to study the topology and traﬃc of large-scale
networks. Gradually other studies followed describing
population networks of practical interest in social sci-
ence, critical infrastructures and epidemiology (Albert
and Barab`asi, 2002; Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2003;
Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2004). The possibility of
accessing and mining large-scale data sets allows a more
detailed statistical analysis and theoretical characteri-
zation of correlation patterns, hierarchies and commu-
nity structure of these networks, along with the setup of
new modeling frameworks. In particular, the systematic
study of these systems has shown the ubiquitous presence
of complex features, mathematically encoded in statisti-
cal distributions with heavy-tails, diverging ﬂuctuations,
self-organization and emerging phenomena and patterns.

The statistical properties induced by these complex
features indicate the presence of topological and struc-
tural properties that do not ﬁnd an explanation in the
paradigm put forward by Erd¨os and Renyi with the ran-
dom graph model (Erd¨os and Renyi, 1960). Indeed, even

if the Erd¨os-Renyi model rationalizes the small-world
property of networks (i.e. the short distance measured
in number of links among nodes), it fails in reproduc-
ing the high level of local cohesiveness observed in many
networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). Additionally, sev-
eral of these networks are characterized by the statistical
abundance of nodes with a very large degree k; i.e. the
number of connections to other nodes. For these ’scale-
free’ networks, the degree probability distribution P (k)
spans over a wide range of k values which signals the ap-
preciable occurrence of large degree nodes, the ’hubs’ of
the system. Finally, it is important to remark that the
topological features of networks turn out to be extremely
relevant since they have a strong impact in assessing their
physical properties such as robustness, vulnerability, or
the ability to spread a disease (Barab`asi and Albert,
1999; Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2003; Pastor-Satorras
and Vespignani, 2004).

More recently, the activity on complex networks has
been extended to the characterization of weighted net-
works. This representation allows the consideration of
features pertaining to the dynamics and traﬃc ﬂows oc-
curring on networks, adding another dimension in the
description of these systems. Also in this case, the
analysis and the characterization of weighted quanti-
ties have pointed out the presence of large scale hetero-
geneity and non-trivial correlations (Barrat et al, 2004).
The weighted graph representation provides valuable el-
ements that open the path to a series of questions of fun-
damental importance in the understanding of networks.
Among those, the issue of how dynamics and structure
aﬀect each other and the impact of traﬃc ﬂows on the
basic properties of spreading and congestion phenomena.

Finally, it spurs the more theoretical questions on how
all these properties may be considered in generative net-
works models.

In the realm of urban and environmental planning, spa-
tial analysis and regional science, the interest for com-
plex networks has noticeably increased during the last
years. In his investigation of the structure of the mod-
ern urban fabric, Salingaros (2001 and 2003) invokes the
concepts of small world network and scale free proper-
ties and suggests a parallelism between the city and an
ecosystem. Starting from the principle that connective
webs are the main source of urban life, Salingaros invites
planners to apply complex networks analysis to under-
stand properties such as resilience and self-organization.
While these studies are mostly based on conceptual ar-
guments, other authors (Shiode and Batty, 2000; Batty,
2001 and 2003) promote the development of quantitative
analyses with a twofold perspective: (i) explaining the
behavior of complex networks such as the world wide web
in terms of geography, demography and economics; and
(ii) improving the eﬃciency of advanced spatial analysis
GIS-based tools, by integrating the foundation of com-
plex networks analysis into geographic information sci-
ence. Batty (2001) along with Salingaros acknowledges
the existence of a link between eﬃcient urban connectiv-
ity and self-preserving behaviors and fosters the develop-
ment of complex networks to study the functional mech-
anisms of cities. It is interesting to note that a similar
approach has been extremely fruitful in the study of the
Internet in relation with the geographical and social en-
vironment (Yook et al, 2002; Gorman, 2001; Barth´elemy
et al, 2003; Gorman and Kulkarni 2004; Pastor-Satorras
and Vespignani, 2004; Schintler et al, forthcoming).

In the domain of geographic information science, Jiang
and Claramunt (2004) proposed to use complex network
tools to investigate quantitatively the urban space syn-
tax. Aiming at the improvement of the eﬀectiveness
of network GIS advanced analysis, they use topologi-
cal measures of connectivity, average path length and
generalised clustering to compare three large street net-
works of the cities of G¨alve, Munich and San Francisco.
Fertile research directions are also currently explored in
the domain of transportation systems and human traﬃc
analysis. For example, the small-world properties of the
Boston subway system have been characterized by Latora
and Marchiori (2000-2003) and Sen et al (2003) studied
the topology of the Indian railway network. At the urban
level, a network study has been carried out by Chowell et
al (2003) using large scale simulations (with census and
demographic data integration) in order to describe urban
movements of individuals in Portland, Oregon (USA).
On a larger scale, recent studies have focused on the net-
work properties of major transportation infrastructure
such as the US Interstate highway network and the air-
port network. (Gastner and Newman, 2004; Guimera et
al, 2003). Finally, Barrat et al (2004) have provided the
ﬁrst study of the worldwide airports network including
the traﬃc ﬂows and their correlation with the topologi-

2

cal structure. In this research area, the network approach
might provide relevant information on issues such as traf-
ﬁc analysis and risk assessment in case of damages and
attacks.

In the present work we use a network approach to
study the Sardinian inter-municipal commuting network
(SMCN), which describes the everyday work and study-
led movements among 375 municipalities in the Italian
region of Sardinia. We obtain a weighted network rep-
resentation in which the vertices correspond to the Sar-
dinian municipalities and the valued edges to the amount
of commuting traﬃc among them. We provide a detailed
quantitative study of the resulting network, aiming at
a ﬁrst characterization of the structure of human traﬃc
at the inter-city level and its relation with the topologi-
cal structure deﬁned by the connectivity pattern among
cities. Very interestingly, while the network topology ap-
pears to ﬁt within the standard random graph paradigm,
the weighted description oﬀers a very diﬀerent perspec-
tive with complex statistical properties of the commuting
ﬂows and highly non-trivial relations between weighted
and topological properties. We discuss these properties
in relation with the geographical, social and demographi-
cal aspects of the system and show the potentiality of the
network approach as a valuable tool at various stages of
the policy-making and environmental planning process.
In the next sec-
tion, we describe the dataset. In section 3, we carry out
the analysis of the topology of the network. In section

network and in section 5, we discuss the implications of

logical and weighted network analysis results with socio-
economic characteristics of the Sardinian municipalities
and we discuss their relations. We ﬁnally summarize our
results in section 7, while in section 8 we discuss the dif-
ferent research directions that this work suggests.

The paper is organized as follows.

II. SETTING THE CASE STUDY: DATA AND
GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES

Sardinia is the second largest Mediterranean island
with an area of approximately 24, 000 square kilometers
and 1, 600, 000 inhabitants. Its geographical location and
morphological characters have determined an important
history of commercial and cultural relations with trans-
borders external communities and have also favoured the
development of a strong social identity and of impor-
tant political movements toward self-reliance and auton-
omy. At the date of 1991, the island was partitioned
in 375 municipalities, the second simplest body in the
Italian public administration, each one of those generally
corresponding to a major urban centre (in Figure 1, on
the left, we report the geographical distribution of the
municipalities). For the whole set of municipalities the
Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) has issued

the origin-destination table (ODT) corresponding to the
commuting traﬃc at the inter-city level. The ODT is
constructed on the output of a survey about commut-
ing behaviors of Sardinian citizens. This survey refers
to the daily movement from the habitual residence (the
origin) to the most frequent place for work or study (the
destination): the data comprise both the transportation
means used and the time usually spent for displacement.
Hence, ODT data give access to the ﬂows of people regu-
larly commuting among the Sardinian municipalities. In
particular we have considered the external ﬂows i
j
which measure the movements from any municipality i
to the municipality j and we will focus on the ﬂows of in-
dividuals (workers and students) commuting throughout
the set of Sardinian municipalities by all means of trans-
portation. This data source allows the construction of the
Sardinian inter-municipal commuting network (SMCN)
in which each node corresponds to a given municipality
and the links represent the presence of a non-zero ﬂow of
commuters among the corresponding municipalities.

→

FIG. 1: Geographical versus topologic representation of the
SMCN: the nodes (red points) correspond to the towns, while
the links to a ﬂow value larger than 50 commuters between
two towns.

The standard mathematical representation of the re-
sulting network is provided by the adjacency matrix A of
elements (aij). The elements on the principal diagonal
(aii) are set equal to zero, since intra-municipal com-
muting movements are not considered here. Oﬀ-diagonal
terms aij are equal to 1 in the presence of any non-zero
ﬂow between i and j (i
i) and are equal
to 0 otherwise. The adjacency matrix is then symmetric
and describes regular bi-directional displacements among
the municipalities. The adjacency matrix contains all
the topological information about the network but the
dataset also provides the number of commuters attached
to each link. It is therefore possible to go beyond the mere
topological representation and to construct a weighted
graph where the nodes still represent the municipal cen-
tres but where the links are valued according to the ac-

tual number of commuters. Analogously to the adjacency
matrix A, we thus construct the symmetric weighted ad-
jacency matrix W in which the elements wij are com-
puted as the sum of the i
i ﬂows between
→
the corresponding municipalities (per day). The elements
wij are null in the case of municipalities i and j which
do not exchange commuting traﬃc and by deﬁnition the
diagonal elements are set to zero . According to the as-
sumption of regular bi-directional movements along the
links, the weight matrix is symmetric and the network is
described as an undirected weighted graph. The weighted
graph provides a richer description since it considers the
topology along with the quantitative information on the
dynamics occurring in the whole network. It is however
important to stress that while the nodes correspond to
municipalities located in the physical space, the graph
representation does not contain any information explic-
itly related to geographical distances and other spatial
characteristic of the network. The deﬁnition of a net-
work representation that correlates topological and traﬃc
characteristics with the spatial properties of the SMCN
requires more reﬁned investigation and will be presented
elsewhere (De Montis et al, forthcoming).

III. THE ANALYSIS OF THE TOPOLOGICAL
PROPERTIES OF THE SMCN

In this section, we analyze the topology of the SMCN
and we propose possible territorial explanations for our
ﬁndings. This network is relatively small being charac-
terized by N = 375 vertices and E = 16, 248 edges. The
degree k of nodes, which measures the number of links
of each node, ranges between 8 and 279 and exhibits a
high average value . The degree can be considered as a
ﬁrst indication of the topological centrality of a vertex:
the importance of the corresponding municipal centre as
attraction point for commuters in the network. A mea-
sure of the topological distance within the network is
given by the shortest path length deﬁning the distance
between nodes in terms of links to be traversed by us-
ing the shortest possible path between the nodes. On
the average, the shortest path length is l
2.0, while
the maximum length is just equal to 3. These values
are small compared to the number of nodes, in agree-
ment with a small-world behavior for which l typically
scales as the logarithm of N . Further information on
the network’s topology is provided by the degree distri-
bution P (k) deﬁned as the probability that any given

tinguish between an ’exponential’ network similar to the
usual random graph for which P (k) decreases exponen-
tially fast, and scale-free networks indicative of hub-like
hierarchies for which P (k) decreases typically as a power
law (Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Amaral et al, 2000). In
the present case, the degree probability distribution is
skewed and is relatively peaked around a mean value of
order 40 (Figure 2). The tail of the distribution contains

outliers with respect to a regular exponential decay, sig-
naling the presence of municipal hubs, which exchange
commuters with many others municipalities. However, a
closer inspection of the distribution tail shows that the
decay is not compatible with a heavy-tailed distribution.
The tail has indeed a power-law behavior however with
an exponent that ensures the convergence of the relevant
moments of the distribution and does not imply a scale-
free heterogeneity. In particular, the variance converges
to a ﬁnite limit for inﬁnitely large systems in contrast
with scale-free networks, which have an inﬁnite variance
for inﬁnite size networks.

A further relevant topological quantity is the clustering
coeﬃcient deﬁning a measure of the level of cohesiveness
around any given node. It is expressed as the fraction of
connected neighbors

C(i) =

2Ei
ki(ki −

1)

(1)

where E(i) is the number of links between the neighbors
1)/2 is the maximum num-
of the node i and ki(ki −
ber of possible interconnections among the neighbors of
the node. This quantity is deﬁned in the interval [0, 1]
and measures the level of local interconnectedness of the
network.
If C(i) = 0, the neighbors of the node i are
not interconnected at all, while C(i) = 1 corresponds to
the case where all the neighbors are interconnected. A
large clustering thus indicates the existence of a locally
well-connected neighborhood of nodes. It is often conve-
nient to average C(i) over all nodes with a given degree
k obtaining the clustering spectrum

C(k) =

1

N P (k) Xi/ki=k

C(i)

(2)

where N P (k) is the total number of nodes of degree k.
In Figure 3, on the left, we plot the clustering spectrum
of the SMCN: we observe a decaying behavior with C(k)
that varies from 0.8 to values lower than 0.2. This indi-
cation of a decreasing clustering suggests that the SMCN

behaves like other studied real networks, in that low de-
gree municipalities belong to well interconnected working
or studying communities while the high degree vertices,
the urban hubs, connect otherwise disconnected regions.
It is worth noting that this result is similar to the one
obtained by Chowell et al (2003) for urban movement.
There is a striking diﬀerence however since the SMCN
is topologically very close to a random graph while the
network studied in Chowell et al (2003) is a scale-free
network. This similarity with a random graph is also
conﬁrmed by the average value of the clustering coeﬃ-
cient
= 0.26, that results to be of the same order of
the clustering coeﬃcient theoretically computed for the
case of a generalized random graph, which is

Another important property is the degree similarity of
the neighbors of a node. This is measured by the average
degree of the nearest neighbors of a given node i

knn(i) =

where
(i) denotes the set of neighbors of i. Analogously
to the clustering coeﬃcient, we can average the assorta-
tivity over nodes with a given degree leading to

V

knn(k) =

N P (k) Xi/ki=k

knn(i)

(5)

This spectrum measures the tendency of vertices to be
connected with vertices with the same degree properties.
If knn(k) increases with k, nodes have a tendency to con-
nect to nodes with a similar or larger degree and the
network is said to be assortative. In contrast, if knn(k) is
decreasing with k, small degree nodes connect preferen-
tially to hubs and the network is deﬁned as disassortative.
The result obtained for the SMCN is shown in Figure 3,
on the right, and displays a knn with decreasing trend.
This result seems to indicate that the SMCN belongs to
the class of disassortative mixed networks. The disas-
sortative behavior is typical of technological and trans-
portation network and signals the presence of a global

hierarchy in which the hubs tend to provide the connec-
tivity to the small degree nodes at the periphery of the
network.

IV. THE SMCN WEIGHTED NETWORK
ANALYSIS

The ODT dataset provides the number of commuters
among municipalities, allowing the construction of the
weighted graph representation of the SMCN. The anal-
ysis of these commuting ﬂows informs us on the system
dynamical behavior and on the needs of the commuters
in terms of regional transportation services and infras-
tructure. This information might provide relevant indi-
cation to researchers and decision-makers for addressing
environmental policies and planning.

A. Weight analysis

i ≈

w
h

The values of the weights between pairs of vertices
ranges between 1 and wmax = 13, 953 with an average
value
23 much lower than wmax. This fact is a sig-
nature of a high level of heterogeneity in the SMCN, since
a peaked distribution of weights would very unlikely give
a maximum value that is 3 orders of magnitude larger
than the average.
Indeed, the probability distribution
P (w) that any edge has a weight w displays a power-law
w−γw with an exponent γw ≈

FIG. 4: On the left: Log-Log plot of the probability distri-
bution of the weights (the straight line is a power law ﬁt of
exponent 1.8). On the right: Log-Log plot of the probability
distribution of the strength (as a guide to the eye we also plot
a power law ﬁt of exponent 2).

Another relevant quantity that characterizes the traﬃc

is given by the strength of a node, deﬁned as

s(i) =

wij

Xj∈V(i)

(6)

This quantity corresponds to the total traﬃc commuting
in the town i and can be considered as a measure of the
traﬃc centrality of a municipality. For the SMCN, the
strength varies between 1 and 64, 834 while its average
value is equal to 1, 010. The probability distribution of
the strength P (s) that any given node has a strength s is

5

s−γs with exponent
ﬁtted by a power-law regime P (s)
2 (Figure 4, on the right). The strength provides an
γs ≈
intuitive parameter for the description of the centrality
of Sardinian municipalities according to the actual traﬃc
handled generated and received by the municipality.

∼

In the ﬁrst instance, the variation in the weight and
strength values implies that commuters’ ﬂows are dis-
tributed in a broad spectrum with a large heterogeneity.
It is worth commenting the implications of a power-law
behavior of the statistical distributions P (s) and P (w).
This behavior deﬁnes the so-called heavy tailed distribu-
tions which have a virtually unbounded variance. A pe-
culiar fact about a distribution with a heavy tail is that
there is a ﬁnite probability of ﬁnding vertices with weight
or strength much larger than the average value. In other
words, the consequence of heavy tails is that the average
behavior of the system is not typical. The characteristic
weight (or strength) is the one that, picking up a vertex at
random, should be encountered most of the times. This
is evident in the bell-shaped distribution observed for the
degree of the SMCN, in which the average value is very
close to the maximum of the distribution and represents
the most probable value in the system. On the contrary,
the distributions shown in Figure 4 are highly skewed.
Vertices have an appreciable probability of having large
strength values, yet all intermediate values are probable
and their mean does not represent any special value for
the distribution. The power-law behavior and the rela-
tive exponent thus represent a quantitative measure of
the level of heterogeneity of the network’s traﬃc.

Another important question concerns the distribution
of the traﬃc among the diﬀerent roads. All the con-
nections could carry a similar ﬂow or on the contrary
one connection could dominate. A convenient measure
of this is given by the disparity (Barth´elemy et al, 2005),
deﬁned as

Y2(i) =

Xj∈V(i)

2

We computed the value of Y2 for each node and we
average these quantities for each degree in order to ob-
tain Y2(k). The result is shown on Figure 5, on the
left. We obtain here an average behavior of the form
kY2(k)
0.4. This result shows that
the weights on the links attached to a given node are
very heterogeneous. In other words, there are only a few
dominant connections, while the traﬃc on all the other
roads is very small.

B. The analysis of traﬃc-topology correlations

∼

kβ with an exponent β

In order to inspect in more detail the relation be-
tween the degree and the traﬃc, we show in Figure 6
the strength of nodes as a function of their degree. De-
spite the existence of inevitable ﬂuctuations, we observe
over a wide range of degrees a power-law behavior of the
form s(k)
Indepen-
dent weights and connectivities would give a value β = 1
(Barrat et al., 2004) and the result obtained here reveals
that there is strong correlation between the traﬃc and
the topology. The strength of the nodes grows faster
than their degree: the more a municipality is connected
with other centres the much more it is able to exchange
commuters’ ﬂows or, in other terms, the traﬃc per con-
nection is not constant and increases with the number of
connections.

The presence of weights also alters the deﬁnition of
other structural measures. For instance, the standard
topological clustering coeﬃcient used in the previous sec-
tion needs to be augmented by the inclusion of the actual
traﬃc. In order to understand the weight structure and
their relation with topology, the weighted clustering co-
eﬃcient can be deﬁned as follows (Barrat et al, 2004)

Cw(i) =

si(ki −

(8)

where alm is an element of the adjacency matrix and

6

1) is a normalization factor which ensures
where si(ki −
that Cw(i) belongs to [0, 1]. As for the topological case
it is possible to average over all nodes of same degree k
obtaining the clustering spectrum Cw(k). The weighted
clustering coeﬃcient counts for each triple formed in the
neighborhood of the vertex i the weight of the two par-
ticipating edges starting from i. In this way, we are not
just considering the number of closed triangles but also
their total relative weight with respect to the vertex’
strength. In the case of random networks Cw = C but
in real weighted networks, we can however face two dif-
ferent situations. If Cw < C the topological clustering
is generated by edges with low weight and therefore the
cohesiveness is less important in terms of traﬃc proper-
ties. On the contrary, if Cw > C we are in presence of
a network in which the interconnected triples are more
likely formed by edges with larger weight. We show in
Figure 7 (on the right) an example of such a situation.
It is clear that the interconnected triple has a major role
in the network dynamics and organization, and that the
clustering properties are not completely exploited by a
simple topological analysis. The weighted clustering co-
eﬃcient takes into account the weighted elements by an
appropriate mathematical form.

In the SMCN the values of the weighted clustering co-
eﬃcient are larger than the corresponding topological val-
ues Cw > C (Figure 7, on the left) over the entire range
of degree values. In contrast with the topological cluster-
ing, the weighted clustering coeﬃcient is approximately
constant over the whole range of connectivity. This re-

sult reveals the existence of a rich-club phenomenon in
that important cities form a group of well interconnected
nodes and that weight heterogeneity is enough in order
to balance the lack of topological clustering. The rich-
club phenomenon implies that in the SMCN the intercon-
nected triplets are more frequently built by edges with a
higher weight (Figure 7, on the right): in terms of local
cohesiveness of workers’ and students’ commuting sys-
tem, two diﬀerent destinations available from a given city
are more likely to be connected if the traﬃc ﬂow leading
to them is large. Similarly to the weighted clustering, we

need to integrate the information on weights in a sensi-
ble deﬁnition of assortativity/disassortativity. This can
be easily done by introducing the weighted average de-
gree of the nearest neighbors of a given node i

FIG. 8: On the left, top: weighted assortativity; on the
left, bottom: relative diﬀerence between the weighted and the
topological assortativity; on the right: a diﬀerence between
the weighted and the topological assortativity indicates that
large cities are connected by large ﬂow links.

In this case, we perform a local weighted average of
the nearest neighbor degree according to the normalized
weight of the connecting edges. This deﬁnition implies
that kw
nn > knn if the edges with the larger weights
are pointing to the neighbors with larger degree and
nn < knn in the opposite case. The kw
kw
nn thus mea-
sures eﬀective aﬃnity to connect with high or low degree
neighbors according to the magnitude of the actual in-
teractions.
In the SMCN the weighted average degree
of the nearest neighbors displays a slightly increasing
pattern, which is a signature of assortativity (Figure 8).
This result is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the
topological disassortativity and indicates an aﬃnity of
high-degree municipalities with other large centers with
which they exchange high number of commuters: hubs
have more frequently large traﬃc ﬂows with municipal-
ities with the same or higher-order degree. This phe-
nomenon is illustrated on Figure 8, on the right:
large
weights connect hubs while the connection with nodes of
smaller degree has smaller weights.

V. DISCUSSION: THE SMCN AND ITS
RELATION WITH REAL ENVIRONMENTAL
SYSTEMS

A. Topology and environmental properties

The ranking connected to the degree (Table 1), an in-
dex of topological centrality, conﬁrms the existence of ad-
ministrative and socio-economic hierarchies: among the
hubs, Cagliari is the most populated and regional capi-
tal town, Nuoro, Oristano and Sassari are province cap-
ital towns, Macomer and Quartu Sant’Elena are emerg-
ing productive and residential centres. While the SMCN

network is not scale free, the analysis of the degree prob-
ability distribution still reveals the presence of a rela-
tively large number of well-connected towns that attract
commuters from a fairly high number of satellite cen-
ters. The behavior of the clustering coeﬃcient versus
the degree indicates that for k < 50 the clustering is
relatively high and is a signature of the fact that small
towns (small k) form very well connected clusters of mu-
nicipalities exchanging students and workers. On the
contrary, hub-towns (k > 50) have less cohesive neigh-
borood since they have commuting ﬂows with several dif-
ferent local clusters of municipalities not interconnected
among them. This kind of star-like topology with large
municipalities acting as hub for several smaller groups
of municipalities is conﬁrmed by the analysis of the av-
erage nearest neighbor degree spectrum suggesting that
the SMCN belongs to the class of dissassortative mixed
networks. In this case, high degree hubs link preferen-
tially with low degree municipalities. This topological
analysis would suggest the existence of inter-municipal
commuting districts of small towns, which pivot around
a few urban poles and could be interpreted as the sig-
nature of a phenomenon often observed in urban and
transportation systems when top functional rank towns
attract commuters from small centers, behaving as urban
poles. In such an environment, citizens of the satellite
centers, being interested to regional-level services such
as public administration, health and ﬁnance, prefer com-
muting to the pole rather than to a peer level town. The
heterogeneity detected in the pattern of municipal cen-
ters could be seen as functional to an eﬃcient behavior
of the whole network, since each urban hub exchange
commuters, and thus goods, services and revenues, with
several small size towns. Turning to the geographical
displacement of the hub centers, we can note that as ex-
pected they are located far away from each other. The
distance between Cagliari and Sassari is equal to 210 Km,
while from Cagliari and Nuoro to 160 Km, with respect
to a total length of the island equal to 230 Km.

B. Traﬃc and environment in the weighted
characterization of the SMCN

The heterogeneity of the weights, as we saw in the pre-
vious chapters, is very high. This implies that the links
are not all equivalent and thus warns against any inter-
pretation based on the sole topology. Indeed, the analysis
of the weighted network introduces new insights in the
interpretation elaborated on the result of the topological
properties under a variety of perspectives.

Since the weights are distributed in a very heteroge-
neous pattern, the corresponding commuters’ ﬂows dis-
play a wide range of values, which reﬂects the existence
of a territorial hierarchy embedded and supported by the
underlined transportation network. Precise indications
emerge about dominant relations between some of the
major poles of the island (Table 2): Cagliari, Sassari,
Olbia, Assemini, Porto Torres and Capoterra.

In particular, the analysis of the strength probability
distribution shows that municipalities identiﬁed as topo-
logical poles behave also as attractors of traﬃc ﬂows.
The strength is broadly distributed along the nodes, re-
vealing a strong hierarchical dominance of the dynamic
hubs over other smaller level centers. The analysis of the

and the larger their traﬃc centralities (ie. their capac-
ity to attract Sardinian commuting students and work-
ers). The ranking of Sardinian municipalities according
to their strength is reported in Table 3.

From the behavior obtained for the disparity (Fig.
5), we see that only few connections emerging from the
hub-towns carry a large amount of traﬃc, indicating a
strong hierarchy and heterogeneity also in the local struc-
ture of the ﬂows connecting large municipalities of the
SMCN. This mirrors the underlying road network struc-
ture, which comprises a very small set of main highways
(state roads), a large set of medium-sized roads (provin-
cial roads) and a very large set of local roads (munici-
pal roads). In particular, the link Cagliari-Sassari corre-
sponds to state road number 131, named ’Carlo Felice’
that is the highway crossing longitudinally the island and
can be considered as the backbone of the SMCN struc-
ture to which the lower hiearchical levels transportation
structures connect.

The use of the traﬃc information provides further in-
sight on the structure and hierarchy of the network. In
particular the diﬀerence detected between weighted and
topological clustering coeﬃcients weighted versus topo-
logical assortativity indicates the presence of a distri-
bution of traﬃc ﬂows that might be indicative of what
sometimes is referred to as the rich-club phenomenon.
Indeed, it is possible to observe that large traﬃc ﬂows
are characterizing the commuter traﬃc among munici-
palities with high centrality ranks as measured in terms
of degree and strength. The accumulation of weight on
these centers attenuates the decaying of the clustering
and average nearest neighbour spectrum that appears to
invert their behaviour by using the weighted deﬁnitions.
This is the sign of the existence of a backbone of com-
muting patterns among large municipalities which are
all interconnected, while the ﬂows toward peripheral mu-
nicipalities are indeed of small size. According to this
picture, small municipalities are mostly connected each
other through small traﬃc links, which correspond to
the underlying second or third order roads. This com-
pletes the topological information and oﬀers a clear pic-
ture of the ordering principles of the SMCN, in which
a large number of small-size cities tend to become satel-
lites of higher rank municipalities, shaping an overall net-
work structure widely punctuated with star-like subsys-
tems pivoting around important urban poles connected
through dominant roads and the corresponding traﬃc
ﬂows. In this respect it appears that the network analysis
presented here is able to provide an extremely detailed
and quantitative characterization of the structure of the
inter-urban traﬃc system.

C. Relating topology and traﬃc to socio-economic
phenomena

relation between strength and degree shows that traﬃc
grows superlinearly with the degree conﬁrming the fact
that the more the topological hub-towns are connected

In this section, we provide a discussion of the emergent
topological and traﬃc properties in relations to the de-

mographic and economic properties of the towns of the
SMCN. In the previous sections, we observe that the val-

ues of degree k and of the strength s, as indexes of topo-
logical and weighted centrality, conﬁrm quantitatively
historical structural hierarchies among Sardinian towns.
The heterogeneity of the strength and the degree can be
visualized as shown in the thematic map representations
of Figure 9.

We explore now in quantitative terms the relation be-
tween the network properties and the environmental and
economical indicators. One goal is to inspect whether
the commuting network hubs correspond to economically
relevant towns. As a measure of social and economic cen-
trality of each town, we consider two variables: the total
resident population (pop) in 1991 (Istat, 1991) and the
average monthly income (mmi). The average monthly in-
come, an index of urban aggregated wealth, is deﬁned as
the product of the average monthly income per worker
times the number of workers (Carcangiu et al, 1993).
A map representation using these indicators is shown in
Figure 10.

In Figure 11, we plot the variable pop as a function of
the degree k and the strength s and we observe a clear
positive correlation. The association between the popu-
lation and these variables has a power-law behavior with
two diﬀerent exponents related by a factor 1.9. This is
expected since we have already observed that traﬃc and
degree are related by an empirical law s k1.9. This implies
that if the population has a scaling pop sa, the simple sub-
stitution of variable yields pop k1.9a. This is conﬁrmed
in the analysis where the slopes of the two curves are
related by a factor close to two. It is interesting to note
that the population scales almost linearly with the traﬃc
which suggest that a constant fraction of the population
of every city commutes to another town, irrespectively of

In Figure 12, the monthly municipal income (mmi)
is plotted versus the degree k and the strength s. A
positive correlation is signaled by a linear behavior on
a log-Log scale which indicates the presence of a power
law association. Also in this case, the exponents of the
two relations conﬁrm the general result of a quadratic
relation between strength and degree.

The results of this section conﬁrm that the central-
ity measures (strength and degree) display trends consis-
tent with the behavior of social and economic indicators
such as population and income. In this sense, the higher
the network centrality of a node, the higher is its demo-
graphic and economic size. The aforementioned territo-
rial size measures, pop and mmi grow much faster with
the degree k than with the strength s. We can therefore
identify a group of variables related to population (s, pop,
mmi) that are correlated by association laws with a be-
havior very close to the linear one. Their relation with

ﬂows indicating a kind of adaptive equilibrium of a soci-
etal system. It is interesting to note that the worldwide
airport network exhibits association trends among the
network infrastructure and the population size very sim-
ilar to those observed in this study (Barrat et al., 2004),
suggesting a possible level of universality. The detailed
study of other commuting and transportation networks
is however needed in order to gain further insight on this
issue.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the inter-urban commuting system of the
island of Sardinia has been represented as a weighted net-
work. This representation allows the quantitative char-
acterization of the capacity of attraction of each urban
center on workers and students. By comparing the dif-
ferent levels of hierarchies emerging in the network with
the pattern of demographic and economic poles we shed
light on several structural and organizational properties
of the inter-municipal traﬃc system.

At ﬁrst sight, the SMCN is similar to a small-world
random (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). The clustering or-
ganization of the SMCN however diverges from the usual
random paradigm and similarly to other technological
networks, such as the airline network, suggests a hi-
erarchy of nodes where small municipalities are locally
densely interconnected, while large municipalities (re-
gional hub) provide the long range connectivity for dif-
ferent areas of the islands otherwise disconnected. This

10

picture is reinforced by the evidence of a disassortative
mixed network where the hub municipalities are found to
act as star-like vertices connecting on average municipal-
ities with low degree and low centrality ranking.

The weighted representation of the network allowed
by the inclusion of traﬃc data complements the result-
ing picture with important information relating the com-
muter traﬃc to the available topological connectivity. We
ﬁnd that both the weights and the strengths are very
broadly distributed, conﬁrming the necessity of including
those measures in a realistic description of the SMCN. In
particular, the probability distributions of weights and
strengths (commuter traﬃc handled by the municipal-
ity) display a power-law regime over a wide range of de-
gree values: the SMCN behaves as a scale-free weighted
In addition, the traﬃc is strongly correlated
network.
to the connectivity of the municipality and moreover, as
shown by the disparity, it is largely concentrated on a
very few links. This indicates that the more a town is
connected, the much more it attracts commuters along
a small number of dominant roads. Our analysis of
weighted clustering suggests that important towns form
a group of well-interconnected centers. It also shows that
in the SMCN the main fraction of traﬃc exchanges oc-
curs among the hubs of the network: hub centers accu-
mulate their commuter traﬃc to same or higher order
municipalities. In terms of environmental system anal-
ysis, a large number of small-size centers are commut-
ing satellites of higher rank municipalities. The SMCN
appears as widely punctuated with star-like subsystems
pivoting around important urban poles connected prefer-
entially through high traﬃc roads. In addition, the fact
that the weighted clustering coeﬃcient is large for the
whole range of connectivity suggests that on the local
scale there are micro-commuting basins, rationalized as
inter-municipal districts of highly clustered small towns,
which pivot around a few urban poles belonging to macro
commuting basins.

Interestingly enough, there are striking similarities for
the weight distribution and the clustering obtained in
the present study with those obtained for the networks
of population movements at the urban level (Chowell et
al, 2003): this evidence suggests the existence of a set of
basic mechanisms leading to common features in trans-
portation systems at various granularity levels. In Table
4, the main characteristics of diﬀerent transportations
networks at diﬀerent scales are shown. In particular, it
seems that while the topological properties can vary, the
broadness of the traﬃc distribution is a common feature
to all these networks. Another common feature is the
existence of correlation between the traﬃc and the topol-
ogy.

Finally, the existence of the municipality hierarchy
that we have uncovered with the help of a weighted net-
work analysis is conﬁrmed by comparing demographic
and economic urban polarization in Sardinia. Popula-
tion and wealth, as proxies of the endowment of local
resources, display a positive correlation with topological

and dynamic centrality, strengthening the value of the
network approach as a general tool for the analysis of
inter-urban transportation systems.

VII. OUTLOOK

The results of this investigation open further questions
that are currently under study. The indication of net-
work centrality provides a powerful measure of similarity
of the municipalities in attracting workers and students
daily, more work however is needed to tackle the prob-
lem of the precise identiﬁcation of the communities of
workers/students commuting in Sardinia and their ge-
ographical basins. These studies may provide insights
for bottom-up processes of decision-making and planning
based on the deﬁnition of the existing emerging behaviors
of the citizens. Finally, the SMCN is obviously not inde-
pendent from geography and space. It refers to a phys-
ical network, mostly based on road systems, which dis-
play precise geographical characteristics. Further studies
which include spatial aspects of the network are currently
under progress. This forthcoming analysis will hopefully
provide decision-makers and planners with relevant indi-
cations on the global eﬀect of new infrastructure.

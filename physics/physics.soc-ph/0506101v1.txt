Abstract

We investigate the Heston model with stochastic volatility and exponential tails as
a model for the typical price ﬂuctuations of the Brazilian S˜ao Paulo Stock Exchange
Index (IBOVESPA). Raw prices are ﬁrst corrected for inﬂation and a period span-
ning 15 years characterized by memoryless returns is chosen for the analysis. Model
parameters are estimated by observing volatility scaling and correlation properties.
We show that the Heston model with at least two time scales for the volatility
mean reverting dynamics satisfactorily describes price ﬂuctuations ranging from
time scales larger than 20 minutes to 160 days. At time scales shorter than 20 min-
utes we observe autocorrelated returns and power law tails incompatible with the
Heston model. Despite major regulatory changes, hyperinﬂation and currency crises
experienced by the Brazilian market in the period studied, the general success of
the description provided may be regarded as an evidence for a general underlying
dynamics of price ﬂuctuations at intermediate mesoeconomic time scales well ap-
proximated by the Heston model. We also notice that the connection between the
Heston model and Ehrenfest urn models could be exploited for bringing new insights
into the microeconomic market mechanics.

1 Introduction

In the last decades the quantitative ﬁnance community has devoted much
attention to the modeling of asset returns having as a major drive the im-
provement of pricing techniques [1] by employing stochastic volatility models
ameanable to analytical treatment such as Hull-White [2], Stein-Stein [3] and
Heston [4] models.

Despite diﬀerences in methods and emphasis, the cross fecundation between
Economics and Physics, which dates back to the early nineteenth century (see
[5] and [6]), has intensiﬁed recently [7]. Following the statistical physics ap-
proach, substantial eﬀort has been made to ﬁnd microeconomic models capable
of reproducing a number of recurrent features of ﬁnancial time series such as:
returns aggregation (probability distributions at any time scale) [8,9], volatil-
ity clustering [11], leverage eﬀect (correlation between returns and volatilities)
[12,13], conditional correlations [14,15] and fat tails at very short time scales
[7]. A central feature of economical phenomena is the prevalence of intertwined
dynamics at several time scales. In very general terms, one could divide the
market dynamics onto three broad classes: the microeconomic dynamics at the
time scales of books of orders and price formation, the mesoeconomic dynam-
ics at the scales of oscillations in formed prices due to local supply and demand
and the macroeconomic dynamics at the scales of aggregated economy trends.

The literature on empirical ﬁnance have emphasized the multifractal scaling
[16] and the power law tails of price ﬂuctuations. However it has been shown
[17] that very large data sets are required in order to distinguish between a
multifractal and power law tailed process and a stochastic volatility model.
In this paper we, therefore, deal with the mesoeconomic dynamics as it would
be described by the Heston model with stochastic volatility and exponential
tails.

Recently, a semi-analytical solution for the Fokker-Planck equation describing
the distribution of log-returns in the Heston model has been proposed [8]. The
authors were able to show a satisfactory agreement between return distribu-
tions of a number of developed market stock indices and the model for time
scales spanning a wide interval ranging from 1 to 100 days. More recently,
the same model has also been employed to describe single stocks intraday
ﬂuctuations with relative success [10].

In this paper we show evidence that the Heston model is also capable of
describing the ﬂuctuation dynamics of an emerging market price index, the
Brazilian S˜ao Paulo Stock Exchange Index (IBOVESPA). We employ for the
analysis 37 years of data since IBOVESPA inception in January, 1968 and

approximately four years of intraday data as well. In this period the Brazilian
economy has experienced periods of political and economical unrest, of hyper-
inﬂation, of currency crises and of major regulatory changes. These distinctive
characteristics make the IBOVESPA an interesting ground for general mod-
elling and data analysis and for testing the limits of description of the Heston
model.

This paper is organized as follows. The next section surveys the Heston model,
its semi-analytical solution and its connection to Ehrenfest urn models. Section
3 discusses the pre-processing necessary for isolating the ﬂuctuations to be
described by the Heston model from exogenous eﬀects. Section 4 describes the
data analysis at low (from daily ﬂuctuations) and high (intraday ﬂuctuations)
frequencies. Conclusions and further directions are presented in Section 5.

2 The Heston Model

2.1 Semi-analytical solution

The Heston Model describes the dynamics of stock prices St as a geomet-
ric Brownian motion with volatility given by a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (or Feller)
mean-reverting dynamics. In the Itˆo diﬀerential form the model reads:

dSt = St µtdt + St√vt dW0(t)
dvt =

θ] dt + κ√vt dW1(t),

γ [vt −

where vt represents the square of the volatility and dWj are Wiener processes

The volatility reverts towards a macroeconomic long term mean squared volatil-
ity θ with relaxation time given by γ−1, µt represents a drift at macroeconomic
scales, the coeﬃcient √vt prevents negative volatilities and κ regulates the am-
plitude of volatility ﬂuctuations.

As we are mainly concerned with price ﬂuctuations, we simplify equation (1)
by introducing log-returns in a window t as r(t) = ln(S(t))
ln(S(0)). Using

2.3 Relation to Ehrenfest Urn Model

The Ehrenfest Urn (EU) as a model for the market return ﬂuctuations has
been studied in [18], in this section we observe that Feller processes as (1) can
be produced by a sum of squared Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes (OU), and
that OU processes can be obtained as a large urn limit for the EM.

To see how those connections take shape we start by supposing that Xj are
OU processes:

dXj(t) =

Xj(t) dt +

dWj(t),

b
2

−

a

(15)

where dWj describe d independent Wiener processes. In this case the variable
j (t) is described by a Feller process as (1) [19]. The volatility

Using the deﬁnition of v and the properties of the Wiener processes it follows
that:

The volatility process in (1) can be recovered with a few variable choices:
κ2
a = κ, b = γ and θ = d
γ . A dynamics with vanishing probability of return

to the origin requires the volatility to be represented by a sum of at least two
elementary OU processes, equivalently we should have α = d

1.

2 ≥

An OU process can be obtained as a limit for an Ehrenfest urn model (EM).
In an EM N numbered balls are distributed between two urns A and B. At
each time step a number 1, ..., N is chosen at random and the selected ball
changes urn. We can specify S(n) = (s1(n), ..., sN (n)) as the system microstate
indicates that the ball j is inside urn A if
at instant n, where sj(n) =
N
j=1 sj(n), which dynamics
sj = 1, we also can deﬁne the macrostate M(n) =
is described by a Markov chain over the space 0, ..., N with transition matrix
given by Q(k, k+1) = 1
= 1.
−
An imbalance in the population between the two urns generates a restitution
force and, consequently, a mean reverting process for M(n). Applying the
thermodynamic limit N
, rescaling time to t = n/N and introducing a

rescaled imbalance variable as:

we recover an OU process:

Using this connection we could speculate on a possible microscopic model
that would generate a stochastic dynamics as described by the Heston model.
Supposing that market agents choose at each time step between two regimes
(urns) that may represent diﬀerent strategies, such as technical and fundamen-
tal trading or expectations on future bullish or bearish markets, imbalances
between populations in each regime would be a source of volatility. In this pic-
ture, the condition d

of volatility would be driving the market. We shall develop this connection
further elsewhere.

3 Data Pre-processing

3.1 The data

Two data sets have been used: IB1 consisting of daily data from IBOVESPA in-
ception on January, 1968 to January, 2005 and IB2 consisting of high-frequency
data sampled at 30 second intervals from March 3, 2001 to October 25, 2002
and from June 6, 2003 to August 18, 2004.

3.2 Inplits and Inﬂation

The dataset IB1 has been adjusted for eleven divisions by 10 (inplits) in-
troduced in the period for disclosure purposes [20] and also for inﬂation by
the General Price Index (IGP) [21]. In ﬁgure 1A we show the discount fac-
tor from date t to current date T , IT (t), used for correcting past prices St as
ST
t = StIT (t). Figure 1B shows the resulting inﬂation adjusted prices. The
hiperinﬂation (average of 25% per month) period from January 1987 to July
1994 is also indicated in both ﬁgures by dashed lines.

ory. B: Historical autocorrelation function measured with 250 days moving windows
for one day lag. The behavior became compatible with a random walk after the Col-
lor Plan in 1990.

3.3 Detrending

For our analysis of price ﬂuctuations it would be highly desirable to identify
macroeconomic trends that may be present in the data. A popular detrend-
ing technique is the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) ﬁltering [22] which is based on
decomposing the dynamics into a permanent component, or trend xP (t), and
into a stochastic stationary component x(t) as r(t) = xP (t) + x(t) by ﬁtting
a smooth function to the data. Any meaningful detrending procedure has to
conserve statistical properties that deﬁne the ﬂuctuations. However, in our
experiments we have noticed that the HP ﬁltering may introduce subdiﬀusive
behavior at long time scales as an artifact when applied on ﬁrst diﬀerences of a
random walk. In this paper, in the absence of a reliable detrending procedure,
we assume that the major long term trend is represented by inﬂation.

3.4 Autocorrelation of Returns

In the period span by data set IB1 the Brazilian economy (see [23] for a brief
historical account) has experienced a number of regulatory changes with con-
sequences for price ﬂuctuations. In [23] it has been observed that the Hurst
exponent for daily IBOVESPA returns shows an abrupt transition from an
average compatible with long memory (H > 0.5) to a random walk behavior
(H = 0.5) that coincides with major regulatory changes (known as the Collor
Plan). We have conﬁrmed the presence of memory by measuring the autocor-

relation function for the entire time series (ﬁgure 2A). We have also measured
the historical autocorrelation for one day lags using a 250 days moving win-
dow and conﬁrm an abrupt behavior change coinciding with the Collor Plan in
1990 (ﬁgure 2B). As the Heston model assumes uncorrelated returns and this
feature only became realistic after the Collor Plan, the following analysis is
restricted to a data set consisting of daily data from January 1990 to January
2005 (IB3).

3.5 Extreme Events and Abnormal Runs

Abnormal runs are sequences of returns of the same sign that are incompatible
with the hypotheses of uncorrelated daily returns. We follow [24] and calculate
for the data set IB3 the statistics of persistent price decrease (drawdowns)
or increase (drawups). We then compare empirical distributions of runs with
shuﬄed versions of IB3. In ﬁgure 3B we show that a seventeen business days
drawdown from March 7, 1990 to March 29,1990 is statistically incompatible,
within a 98% conﬁdence interval, with equally distributed uncorrelated time
series. Observe that the largest drawup shown in ﬁgure 3C correponds to the
subsequent period from March 30, 1990 to April 5, 1990 and that the Collor
Plan was launched in March 1990. We therefore expunged from data set IB3
abnormally correlated runs that took place in March, 1990.

4 Data Analysis

4.1 Low Frequency

After deﬂating prices and expunging autocorrelated returns, four independent
parameters have to be ﬁt to the data: the long term mean volatility θ, the
relaxation time for mean reversion γ−1, the amplitude of volatility ﬂuctuations
κ and the correlation between price and volatility ρ. It has become apparent in
[9] that a direct least squares ﬁt to the probability density (4) yields parameters
that are not uniquely deﬁned. The data analysis adopted in this work consists
in looking for statistics predicted by the model that can be easily measured
and compared. In the following subsections we describe these statistics.

4.1.1 Long term mean volatility θ

The second relaxation time can be introduced into the original Heston model
by making the long-term volatility ﬂuctuate as a mean reverting process like:

where dW2 is an additional independent Wiener process. The autocorrelation

The autocorrelation function ﬁt in ﬁgure 4C indicates that relaxation times are
of very diﬀerent magnitudes and that it may be possible to solve the Fokker-
Planck equation for such model approximately by adiabatic elimination. We
pursue this direction further elsewhere. It is worth mentioning that another
tractable alternative for introducing multiple time scales for the volatility is a
superposition of OU processes as described in [26].

The long term volatility θ and the relaxation time γ−1 have been estimated in
the previous sections. As discussed in section 2.3, the constant α is related to
the number of independent OU processes composing the stochastic volatility
process as d = 2α. To avoid negative volatilities, α
1 is required. We,
therefore, assume α = 1 and calculate the amplitude of volatility ﬂuctuations
from (26) yielding κ = 0.0032(10).

4.1.4 Correlation between prices and volatilities ρ

A nonzero correlation between prices and volatilities in (2) leads to an asym-
metric probability density of returns described by (4). This asymmetry can be
estimated either by directly computing the empirical distribution skewness or
by calculating the empirical leverage function (13). Both procedures imply in
computing highly noisy estimates for third and fourth order moments. In this
section we propose estimating a conﬁdence interval for ρ by computing the
L), where L corresponds to a data set containing
posterior probability p(ρ
the empirically measured leverage function for a given number of time lags.
Bayes theorem [27] gives the following posterior distribution:

The time scale separating micro and mesoeconomic phenomena is shown to be of

4.2 High Frequency

4.2.1 Autocorrelation of intraday returns

Our main aim is to describe the ﬂuctuation dynamics at intermediate time
scales of formed prices (mesosconomic time scales) by a model which assumes
uncorrelated returns. The price formation process occurs at time scales from
seconds to a few minutes where the placing of new orders and double auction
processes take place. We propose to ﬁx the shortest mesoeconomic time scale
to be the point where the intraday autocorrelation function vanishes. In ﬁgure
7 we show that the intraday return autocorrelation function vanishes at about
20 minutes for each of the 4 years composing data set IB2. We, therefore,
consider as mesoeconomic time scales over 20 minutes.

4.2.2 Eﬀective duration of a day

At ﬁrst glance, it is not clear whether intraday and daily returns can be de-
scribed by the same stochastic dynamics. Even less clear is whether aggrega-
tion from intraday to daily returns can be described by the same parameters.
To verify this latter possibility we have to transform units by determining the
eﬀective duration in minutes of a business day Tef f . This eﬀective duration
must include the daily trading time at the S˜ao Paulo Stock Exchange and the
impact of daily and overnight gaps over the diﬀusion process. The S˜ao Paulo
Stock exchange opens daily for electronic trading from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. local
time and from 5:45 p.m. to 7 p.m. for after-market trading, totalizing 8h15min
of trading daily.

To estimate Tef f in minutes we observe that the daily return variance v(1d)
is the result of the aggregation of 20 minute returns, so that, considering a
diﬀusive process, we would have:

v(1d) =

v(20min).

20 days and γ−1

It has been already observed that the volatility ﬂuctuation dynamics are mean
reverting with at least two time scales γ−1
1 year. Con-
sidering the longest relaxation time we estimate Tef f by estimating the mean
daily volatility for each one of the years in IB2. In ﬁgure 8A we show lin-
ear regressions employed for estimating the mean daily variance v(1d) for each
year in IB2 following the procedure described in section 4.1.1.. In ﬁgure 8B we
show linear regressions employed to estimate v(20min), the eﬀective duration
conﬁdence intervals are obtained from (29). The mean 95% conﬁdence interval
over the 4 years analysed results in IC95% (Tef f ) = [9h10min, 9h56min] what
is consistent with 8h15min of daily trading time plus an eﬀective contribution
of daily and overnight gaps.

4.2.3 Probability density of intraday returns

For evaluating the probability density of intraday returns we have reestimated
the mean volatility θ and the amplitude of volatility ﬂuctuations κ along the
period 2001-2004 represented in the data set IB2. We then have rescaled the
dimensional parameters as θ(ID) = θ/Tef f , γ(ID) = γ/Tef f and κ(ID) = κ/Tef f .
Having rescaled the distributions describing our ignorance on the appropriate
returns we have employed Monte Carlo sampling to compute conﬁdence inter-
vals for the short time lags appoximation of the theoretical probability density
described in (9). In ﬁgure 9 we compare the resulting conﬁdence intervals and
the data. We attain reasonably good ﬁts for the longer time scales, as we ap-
proach the microeconomic time scales the theoretical description of the tails

5 Conclusions and Perspectives

We have studied the Heston model with stochastic volatility and exponential
tails as a model for the typical price ﬂuctuations of the Brazilian S˜ao Paulo
Stock Exchange Index (IBOVESPA). Prices have been corrected for inﬂation
and a period spanning the last 15 years, characterized by memoryless returns,
have been chosen for the analysis. We also have expunged from data a draw-
down inconsistent with the supposition of independence made by the Heston
model that took place in the transition between the ﬁrst 22 years of long
memory returns to the memoryless time series we have analysed.

The long term mean volatility θ has been estimated by observing the time
scaling of the log-returns variance. The relaxation time for mean reversion
γ−1 has been estimated by observing the autocorrelation function of the log
returns variance. We have veriﬁed that a modiﬁed version of the Heston model
with two very diﬀerent relaxation times (γ−1
1 year) is
required for describing the autocorrelation function correctly. We have used
the minimum requirement for a non-vanishing volatility α
1 to calculate
the scale of the variance ﬂuctuation κ. Finally, we employed the Bayesian

statistics approach for estimating a conﬁdence interval for the volatility-return
correlation ρ, as it relies on a small data set to calculate a noisy estimate
of higher order moments. The quality of the model is visually inspected by
comparing the empirical probability density at time scales ranging from 1 day
to 160 days, with conﬁdence intervals obtained by a Monte Carlo simulation
over the maximum ignorance parameter distributions. We have also shown
that the probability density functions of log returns at intraday time scales
can be described by the Heston model with the same parameters given that
we introduce an eﬀective duration for a business day that includes the eﬀect
of overnight jumps and that we consider the slow change of the volatility due
to the longer relaxation time γ−1
2 .

It is surprising and non-trivial that a single stochastic model may be capable
of describing the statistical behavior of both developed and emerging markets
at a wide range of time scales, despite the known instability and high sus-
ceptibility to externalities of the latter. We believe that this robust statistical
behavior may point towards simple basic mechanisms acting in the market
microstructure. We regard as an interesting research direction to pursue the
derivation of the Heston model as a limit case for a microeconomic model
like the minority game [28]. For this matter we believe that the connection
between the Heston model and Ehrenfest urns may be valuable.

Perhaps the search for underlying symmetries and simple basic mechanisms
that can explain empirical observations should be regarded as the main con-
tribution of Physics to Economics. This contribution might be particularly
useful to the ﬁeld of Econometrics in which a common view is that a theory
built from data ‘should be evaluated in terms of the quality of the decisions
that are made based on the theory’ [29]. Clearly, these two approaches should
not be considered as mutually exclusive.

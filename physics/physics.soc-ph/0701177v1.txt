Abstrat

The model system is the random Erdös-Renyi network with enhaned lusterization and

Ising spins s = ±1 at the network nodes. Mutually linked spins interat with energy J . The
network parameters are: N = 104
nodes and the average node degree < k >= 4. The Curie
(J > 0) and freezing (J < 0) temperatures Tc are obtained with using the Monte-Carlo
heat bath algorithm, as dependent on the lustering oe(cid:30)ient C . For J > 0 Tc wanders
around 3.0 J when C inreases from almost zero to 0.26. For J < 0 the freezing temperature
dereases with C from 1.5 |J| to zero. The results are preliminary. The disussion is in terms

of the soial networks.

1 Introdution

Random networks - systems with random topology - appeared about nine years ago [1℄ as a

sub jet of interdisiplinary interest with appliations in many sienes, from transport to biology

[2, 3, 4℄. Most of e(cid:27)ort is onentrated on the topologial struture of growing networks, where

the sale-free degree distribution has been found. Here we are interested in the soial networks [5℄.

As it was reognized many times and remarked e. g. in [6℄ the soial networks have not sale-free

topology. They ould be modeled by the lassial Erdös-Renyi networks ([2, 7℄), but there the

lustering oe(cid:30)ient of these networks is too small [6℄. On the other hand, it is obvious that the

topology itself does not re(cid:29)ets the rihness of behaviour of the soial systems. It is worthwhile

to develop theoretial desription of these systems with more degrees of freedom. The simplest

method is to deorate the network nodes with additional variables, as Ising spins s = ±1. These

spins are not statistially independent, but interat. Two basi ases: ferromagneti interation

whih prefers the same sign of neighboring spins, and antiferromagneti interation, whih prefers

their di(cid:27)erent signs, were introdued in Ref. [8℄ and [9℄, respetively. In eah ase, the interation

is in ompetition with some noise, ommonly modeled as thermal noise. In numerous ases, a

variation of the noise intensity leads to a phase transition, from the phase with ordered spins

(low noise) to the phase of disordered spins (large noise). The amount of noise where the ordered

phase disappears is omparable to the Curie temperature in ferromagnets. In fat, spin degrees

of freedom ruled by some stohasti evolution has been used many times to desribe soial

proesses, as for example the opinion dynamis [10℄. In these works, ordering an be treated

as a demonstration of a olletive behaviour despite of the presene of a noise. When we deal

with the soial systems, a soiety an be modeled by the network and the Curie temperature

an be treated as a measure of an ability to a olletive ation of the soiety. This ability is

1

expeted to depend on the topology of interpersonal bonds. In our soiophysial parallel, the

Curie temperature depends on the topology of the investigated network.

The ase of antiferromagneti interation is also of interest for soiophysis. As it was argued

only reently [11℄, a dihotomous behaviour is found in some irumstanes, as buying or selling

[12℄, dove or hawk strategy [13℄ and others. Then the topology of the soial network is partiu-

larly important beause of the frustration e(cid:27)et, whih removes the unique and deep minimum

of the magneti energy.

Instead, numerous loal stable or metastable states appear, and the

struture of the set of these states remains unsolved [14℄. We note that the magneti behaviour

of antiferromagneti growing networks was found to be surprisingly rih [15℄.

Here we are interested in the Erdös-Renyi random network deorated with Ising spins, with

ferromagneti or antiferromagneti interation. To enhane the lusterization oe(cid:30)ient, we

apply the algorithm proposed in Ref.

[16℄ for the growing networks; it is easy to generalize it

for the random networks. Our aim is to investigate, how the lustering in(cid:29)uenes the ritial

temperature. We note that the Curie temperature for the random network was obtained by

Sumour et al.

[17℄. However, up to our knowledge the lusterization oe(cid:30)ient has not been

varied in these networks.

Reently, the same problem for J > 0 was onsidered [18℄ in the hierarhial network, designed

by Watts et al.

[19℄. In that network, the lustering is ontrolled by the probability of linking

di(cid:27)erent lusters. Varying it, one moves from a random network to a set of separate lusters.

The obtained Curie temperature varied from 3.3 J (where J is the Ising exhange integral) to

zero in a step-like way, very sharply. Here we ask if the transition temperature varies with

the lusterization oe(cid:30)ient in the onventional random networks, whih have been disussed in

literature more thoroughly and seem to be more general.

2 The results

At the (cid:28)rst stage of the simulation, a random network is onstruted. The starting point is a set

of N = 104

nodes. A link is plaed between eah two nodes with the probability p. Next, nodes

are seleted with two or more neighbours, and a new link is plaed between eah pair of the

neighbours with probability p′
2N , and the average degree is 4. The lusterization oe(cid:30)ient C is de(cid:28)ned as the average over
nodes i = 1, ..., N of the loal oe(cid:30)ient Ci , where

. In this way, the whole number of links in the network is equal to

Ci =

2yi
ki(ki − 1)

(1)

ki is the degree of i-th node i. e. the number of nodes linked to i, and yi is the number of links
between these ki nodes. Maximal value of Ci is one. The oe(cid:30)ient C varies from almost zero
(when p = 4/N and p′ = 0) to 0.26 (when p = 2.6/N ). One timestep is equivalent to N attempts

to (cid:29)ip a spin.

Considering the ase of J > 0, we alulate the average magnetization against time, M (t),
in the paramagneti phase. Initially, all spins are set to +1. The relaxation time τ is taken

as the number of steps when the average spin is 1/e. The Curie temperature is found from an

extrapolation of 1/ln(τ ) to the temperature axis. The obtained urves are presented in Fig. 1.
As we see, the obtained Curie temperature Tc seems to derease with the lusterization oe(cid:30)ient
C , but the variation is smooth and almost invisible within the statistial errors. This behaviour
aords with the one for the hierarhial topology [18℄, where Tc = 3.3 or zero, with almost

sharp transition between these two values. There, the transition appears beause a division of

the network into separate lusters. Here we do not deal with this e(cid:27)et, beause the mean degree

our results with the plateau of Tc , visible in Fig. 5 of Ref. [18℄.

In the ase with J < 0 we expet the geometrial frustration e(cid:27)et to be present in the system

[20℄. This plus the topologial disorder allows to expet that at low temperatures, the system is

in the spin-glass phase. We alulate the Edwards-Anderson parameter q , de(cid:28)ned as [14℄

where < ... >t is the time average. In Fig. 2, the results on q against temperature are shown
for four values of the lusterization oe(cid:30)ient C . Clearly, the transition temperature dereases
with C . Still, the transition seems fuzzy; our next step will be to improve the statistis and to

investigate the size e(cid:27)et.

3 Disussion

For the ase of a ferromagnet, where J > 0, the smooth derease of the Curie temperature
with the oe(cid:30)ient C marks the fat that the ordered phase is more fragile if the system has

the lustered struture, despite the existing links between the lusters. As it was disussed in

[18℄, the soiologial ounterpart to what we do is the problem of 'weak ties', i. e. relatively

rare ties between highly lustered soial groups. It was onviningly argued by Granovetter [21℄

that a single tie between groups plays an essential role in di(cid:27)usion of innovations and large-sale

soial organization. Considering an antiferromagnet we take into aount that e(cid:27)ets of soial

interations are sometimes inoherent, that the soiety an be polarized in some way and that

it is possible that inreasing of the density of soial ties an be in on(cid:29)it with an ability to (cid:28)nd

best solutions to everyday problems. In this sense, geometrial frustration ombined with noise

an re(cid:29)et some soial phenomena whih disable a oherent soial ation.

One of multiple open questions is if the magneti phase transition is an appropriate metaphor

to illustrate soial states. Being itizens of our soieties and groups, we are onvined that indi-

vidual opportunities of a response to a given historial situation di(cid:27)er strongly from one human

being to another. Statistis an re(cid:29)et this variation only partially; the distribution of possibil-

ities - whatever their de(cid:28)nition ould be - varies in time and an be non self-averaging. Then,

the reality is omposed of statistial properties of rowds and individual ation of the power.

Obviously, our onsideration deals only with the former fator. Still, in many irumstanes

rowds prevail [22℄ and the statistis should work well.

Summarizing, we gave omputational arguments that a lustering of the soial struture

makes a olletive ation less likely, beause partiular lusters/groups beome partially separated

and the ontats between them are hindered.

In the ase of a ferromagneti oupling, the

transition temperature varies with the lustering oe(cid:30)ient only slightly or it remains onstant.

In the ase of an antiferromagneti oupling, the dependene is lear and strong. The result

agrees with a ommon sense, with the speial ase of a ferromagneti hierarhial network [18℄

and with the onlusions of the Granovetter's work [21℄.

We modify the model of Deﬀuant et al. to distinguish true opinion among others in the fashion
of Hegselmann and Krause (http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/9/3/10.html). The basic features of
both models modiﬁed to account for truth seekers are qualitatively the same.

Keywords: Monte Carlo simulation, sociophysics, opinion dynamics

Introduction. Opinion dynamics simulations1,2,3,4
(see Ref. 5 for review) seem to be the most fashionable
part of sociophysics6. When your girlfriend asks you ‘Do
I look ﬁne?’ you may use the Sznajd model2 to answer
this general question as Sznajd agents behave similarly
to magnetic spins: they are allowed to have only two
opinions si ∈ {0, 1} — for example ‘yes’ or ‘no’. But
‘How am I
when the question is open — for instance:
looking like today?’ — the space of possible answers en-
larges drastically. The correct answers are ‘Super!’ and
‘Exceptionally!’ but not ‘O.K.’ or even ‘nice’. The lat-
ter is reserved for the same question but about a pretty
girl starring in any Hollywood movie. For modeling such
opinions the Hegselmann–Krause3 (H-K) or Deﬀuant et
al.4 models are more appropriate as they oﬀer a contin-
uous interval of possible opinions si ∈ [0, 1].

Now, you and your interlocutor may have a wrong
opinion about your girlfriend. The truth may be else-
where. The modiﬁcations of H-K model which allow to
introduce truth seekers among exchanging their opinions
agents were presented very recently in Ref. 7.

In this paper we would like to check if the same is
available for Deﬀuant et al. model4 were Assmann8 had
already introduced a multitude of truths.

The model. In the original Deﬀuant et al. model two
persons (let say i and j) exchange their opinion about
given topic if their current opinions do not diﬀer more
than conﬁdence level ε, i.e. when |si − sj| ≤ ε. In such
case, after discussion their change their opinions slightly,
i.e.

si → si + µδ
sj → sj − µδ

,

(

(1)

where δ = sj − si and µ ∈ [0, 1/2] describes a speed of
opinion changes.
If their opinions are too distant, i.e.
|δ| > ε, the agents do not change their opinions at all.

To account for the true opinion Hegselmann and
Krause introduced two additional parameters: T ∈ [0, 1]

and αi — which represent the true opinion and the
strength of the attraction to the truth for i-th agent,
respectively7.

With these two additional terms Eq. (1) for the Def-

fuant et al. model becomes

(

si → si + µ[αi(T − si) + (1 − αi)δ]
sj → sj + µ[αj (T − sj) − (1 − αj)δ]
The case αi = 0 (i = 1, · · · , N ) corresponds to the orig-
inal Deﬀuant et al. model and for αi = 1 (i = 1, · · · , N )
agents do not exchange opinions each to other but tends
towards the true one.

The results. In Fig. 1 the results of simulation are
presented for opinion dynamics of N = 500 agents with
initially randomly chosen opinions si (the same for all
sub-ﬁgures). The model parameters are shown in the
headline of all sub-ﬁgures. In Fig. 1(a) the opinion dy-
namics governed by original Deﬀuant et al. model is
presented (αi = 0 for all i). In Fig. 1(b) all agents are
the truth seekers. In Figs. 1(c)–(e) half of agents is the
truth seeker (αi > 0, marked as green) while the second
half is not (αi = 0, marked as red). In Fig. 1(f) only 2%
agents search for the truth. Parts c/d, c/e, c/f diﬀer only
with T , ε and the fraction of the truth seekers, respec-
tively. For N = 102 and 103 the results are qualitatively
the same.

The obtained results support the observation from

Figs. 1–8 in Ref. 7.

In conclusions, the Deﬀuant et al. model4 with neces-
sary modiﬁcations which allow to simulate true opinion
among others gives qualitatively the same results as the
H-K model modiﬁed for the same purpose7.

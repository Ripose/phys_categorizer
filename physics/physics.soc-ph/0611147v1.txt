1 Introduction

During the last few years various models of networks [1, 2] have become a
powerful tool for analysis of complex systems in such distant ﬁelds as Internet
[3], biology [4], social groups [5], ecology [6] and public transport [7]. Mod-
eling behavior of economical agents is a challenging issue that has also been
studied from a network point of view. The examples of such studies are mod-
els of ﬁnancial networks [8], supply chains [9, 10], production networks [11],
investment networks [12] or collective bank bankrupcies [13, 14]. Relations
between diﬀerent companies have been already analyzed using several meth-
ods: as networks of shareholders [15], networks of correlations between stock
prices [16] or networks of board directors [17]. In several cases scaling laws for
network characteristics have been observed.

In the present study we consider relations between companies in Poland
taking into account common branches they belong to. It is clear that com-
panies belonging to the same branch compete for similar customers, so the
market induces correlations between them. On the other hand two branches
can be related by companies acting in both of them. To remove weak, acci-
dental links we shall use a concept of threshold ﬁltering for weighted networks
where a link weight corresponds to a number of existing connections (common
companies or branches) between a pair of nodes.

2 Bipartite graph of companies and trades

We have used the commercial database ”Baza Kompass Polskie Firmy B2B”
from September 2005. It contains information about over 50 000 large and
medium size Polish companies belonging to one or more of 2150 diﬀerent
branches. We have constructed a bipartite graph of companies and trades in
Poland as at Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Bipartite graph of companies and trades.

In the bipartite graph we have two kinds of objects: branches A =
1, 2, 3....Nb and companies i = 1, 2, 3......Nf , where Nb – total number of
branches and Nf – total number of companies. Let us deﬁne a branch ca-
pacity |Z(A)| as the cardinality of set of companies belonging to the branch
A. At Fig. 1 the branch A has the capacity |Z(A)| = 2 while |Z(B)| = 3
and |Z(C)| = 1. The largest capacity of a branch in our database was 2486
(construction executives), the second largest was 2334 (building materials).

Let B(i) be a set of branches a given company i belongs to. We deﬁne a

company diversity as |B(i)|. An average company diversity µ is given as

For our data set we have µ = 5.99.
Similarly an average branch capacity ν is given as

and we have ν = 134.

3 Companies and trades networks

The bipartite graph from Fig. 1 has been transformed to create a companies
network, where nodes are companies and a link means that two connected
companies belong to at least one common branch. If we used the example
from Fig.1 we would obtain a companies network presented at Fig. 2.

We have excluded from our dataset all items that correspond to com-
munities (local administration) and for our analysis we consider Nf = 48158
companies. All companies belong to a single cluster. Similarly a trade (branch)

network has been constructed where nodes are trades and an edge represents
connection if at least one company belongs to both branches. In our database
we have Nb = 2150 diﬀerent branches.

4 Weight, weight distribution and networks with cutoﬀs

We have considered link-weighted networks. In the branches network the link
weight means a number of companies that are active in the same pair of
branches and it is formally a cardinality of a common part of sets Z(A) and
Z(B), where Z(A) is a set of companies belonging to the branch A and Z(B)
is a set of companies belonging to the branch B.

Let us deﬁne a function f A
the branch A, otherwise it is zero.

wAB = |Z(A) ∩ Z(B)|

Using the function f A

k the weight can be written as:

The weight distribution p(w), meaning the probability p to ﬁnd a link with a
given weight w, is presented at Figure 4. The distribution is well approximated

with large weights. The maximum weight value is wmax = 764, and the average

equals hwi = 4.67.

Using cutoﬀs for link weights we have constructed networks with diﬀerent
levels of ﬁltering. In such networks nodes are connected only when their edge
weight is no less than an assumed cutoﬀ parameter wo.

A weight in the companies network is deﬁned in a similar way as in the
branches networks, i.e. it is the number of common branches for two companies
— formally it is equal to the cardinality of a common part of sets B(i) and
B(j), where B(i) is a set of branches the company i belongs to, B(j) is a set
of branches the company j belongs to.

Using the function f A

k the weight can be written as

wij = |B(i) ∩ B(j)|

wij =

i f A

The maximum value of observed weights wmax = 207 is smaller in this
networks than in the branches network while the average value equals hwi =
1.48. The weight distribution is not a power law in this case and it shows an
exponential behavior in a certain range.

Similarly to the branches networks we have introduced cutoﬀs in companies
network. At the Fig.5 we present average degrees of nodes and maximum
degrees as functions of the cutoﬀ parameter wo. We have observed a power

while for companies networks αf = 2.13 ± 0.07 and βf = 1.55 ± 0.04.

5 Degree distribution

We have analyzed the degree distribution for networks with diﬀerent cutoﬀ
parameters. At Fig. 6 we present the degree distributions for companies net-
works for diﬀerent values of wo. The distributions change qualitatively with
increasing wo from a nonmonotonic function with an exponential tail (for
wo = 1) to a power law with exponent γ (for wo > 6).

Values of exponent γ for diﬀerent cutoﬀs are given in the Table 3.
Now let us come back to branches networks. At the Fig. 7 we present a
degree distribution for wo = 1. We observe a high diversity of node degrees
— vertices with large values of k occur almost as frequent as vertices with a
small k.

For a properly chosen cutoﬀ values the degree distributions are described
by power laws. For wo = 4 we see two regions of scaling with diﬀerent expo-
nents γ1 and γ2 while a transition point between both scaling regimes appears
at k ≈ 100. The transition appears due to the fact that there are almost no
companies with diversity over 100, so branches with k > 100 have connections
due to several companies, as opposed to branches with k < 100 that can be
connected due to a single company. However the probability that many com-

panies link a single branch with many diﬀerent others is low, thus the degree
probability p(k) decays much faster after the transition point. In the Table 4
we present values γ1 and γ2 for diﬀerent cutoﬀs wo.

It is important to stress that in both networks (companies and branches)
the scaling behavior for degree distribution occurs only if we use cutoﬀs for
links weights, compare Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. It follows that such cutoﬀs act as
ﬁlters for the noise present in the complex network topology.

6 Entropy of network topology

Having a probability distribution of node degrees one can calculated a cor-
responding measure of network heterogeneity. We have used the standard
formula for Gibbs entropy, i.e.

The entropy of degree distribution in branches networks decays logarith-

mically as a function of the cutoﬀ value (Fig. 8)

S = −

p(k) ln p(k)

The behavior has the following explanation. Diversity of node degrees is
decreasing with growing weight cutoﬀ values wo. Larger cutoﬀs reduce total
number of links in the network what leads to a smaller range of k and thus to
smaller values of kmax and hki. The relation between S and hki is presented
at the Fig. 9, where a logarithmic scaling can be seen

with β1 = −0.174 ± 0.006. In branches networks the logarithmic behavior is
present for the whole range of k with β2 = −0.111 ± 0.004.

8 Conclusions

In this study, we have collected and analyzed data on companies in Poland.
48158 medium/large ﬁrms and 2150 branches form a bipartite graph that
allows to construct weighted networks of companies and branches.

12

Link weights in both networks are very heterogenous and a corresponding
link weight distribution in the branches network follows a power law. Remov-
ing links with weights smaller than a cutoﬀ (threshold) wo acts as a kind of
ﬁltering for network topology. This results in recovery of a hidden scaling rela-
tions present in the network. The degree distribution for companies networks
changes with increasing wo from a nonmonotonic function with an exponen-
tial tail (for wo = 1) to a power law (for wo > 6). For a ﬁltered (wo > 4)
branches network we see two regions of scaling with diﬀerent exponents and
a transition point between both regimes. Entropies of degree distributions of
both networks decay logarithmically as a function of cutoﬀ parameter and are
proportional to the logarithm of the mean node degree.

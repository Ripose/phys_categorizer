We analyze the directed, weighted and evolutionary Austrian airline ﬂight network. It is shown
that such a speciﬁc airline ﬂight network displays features of small-world networks, namely large
clustering coeﬃcient and small average shortest-path length. We study the detailed ﬂight informa-
tion both in a week and on a whole. In both cases, the degree distributions reveal power law with
exponent value of 2 ∼ 3 for the small degree branch and a ﬂat tail for the large degree branch. Sim-
ilarly, the ﬂight weight distributions have power-law for the small weight branch. The degree-degree
correlation analysis shows the network has disassortative behavior, i.e. the large airports are likely
to link to smaller airports.

Network behaviors emerge across many interdisci-
plinary sciences and attract many researchers to study
the network feature by analyzing diﬀerent statistical sam-
ples. So-called network is a set of items, which we will
call vertices or sometimes nodes, with connections be-
tween them, called edges. Systems with the form of net-
works are distributed over the world. Examples [1, 2, 3]
includes the Internet, the World Wide Web (WWW), so-
cial networks of friends, networks of business relations be-
tween companies, neutral network, metabolic networks,
food webs, distribution networks such as blood vessels or
postal delivery routes, networks of citations between pa-
pers, networks of paper collaborators, network of publi-
cation download frequency [4], and many others. Even in
nuclear fragmentation, the hierarchial distribution of nu-
clear fragments emerges by Ma’s nuclear Zipf-type plots
around the nuclear liquid gas phase transition, which also
shows a similar character to the scale free network [5, 6].
In a pioneering work of Barabasi and Albert, they
found that the degree of node of Internet routes, URL
(universal resource locator) - linked networks in the
WWW satisﬁes the power-law distribution [7, 8], also
called as the scale-free networks. The degree distribu-
tion of a scale-free network is a power law,

Pk ∼ k−γ,

(1)

where γ is called the degree exponent. In addition, there
are other two main topological structures of complex net-
works: random-graph models [9] and small-world net-
works [10]. The research on random graphs was initiated
by Erd¨os and R´enyi in the 1950s. It has shown that the
degree distribution of a random graph is of Poisson type,
P (k) = e−hkihki/k!. Small-world networks are somehow
in between regular networks and random ones [11].

In this work we study the ﬂight network aﬃliated with
Austrian Airline company. The main purpose is trying
to shed light on understanding the real topological struc-
ture and inherent laws of ﬂight network design of a spe-
ciﬁc airline company. We compare some features of the
ﬂight network with those of the above three categories
of networks. To this end, we would like to check the

similarities and diﬀerences among possibly diﬀerent net-
works. Some studies have been performed for the ﬂight
networks, such as for international transportation airport
network [12, 13, 14] as well as the US and China ﬂight
networks [15, 16]. Some interesting features have been
demonstrated for such ﬂight networks, such as the small-
world property: high clustering coeﬃcient, small diam-
eter and hierarchical structure. However, our present
work is diﬀerent in motivation and results. The previous
ﬂight network involved in a whole national or interna-
tional airport networks, which did not care about the
detailed information of the ﬁghts which were operated
by a speciﬁc airline company. This national- or world-
wide ﬂight network is large scale [12, 13, 14] but it is
the result of collective role from the various Airline com-
pany networks. Therefore, it is of interesting to survey
a particular airline ﬂight network instead of a whole na-
tional or international- wide ﬂight network. Based upon
this motivation, we will investigate a smaller network of
the ﬂights aﬃliated with a speciﬁc airline in the present
work. As an example, we have investigated the ﬂight
network of a central European airline company, Austrian
Airline. The ﬂight information is available in the web
page, http://www.aua.com/

In the ﬂight network, vertices are the airports and
edges are the ﬂights connecting two airports. There are
some features of the structure of ﬂight networks: (1) the
network is directional. All the ﬂights are directed, sorted
as outgoing and incoming. (2) the network has weight.
To reﬂect how busy a certain line is, it is important to
record the exact number of ﬂights between any given air-
port i and j [15], even to record the seat numbers avail-
able in diﬀerent ﬂights [12]. (3) the network may be a
little diﬀerent day by day in a whole week. Hence, the
weekly ﬂight information partially involves the informa-
tion on evolution of the ﬂight network. Our data contain
a whole week information of around N ∼ 134 airports
and 9560 ﬂights. The detailed numbers of the airports
and ﬂights are listed in Table I. For the ﬂights number, it
is the largest on Monday and the smallest on Saturday.
The paper is organized as follows. First we present
a sample of the ﬂight network in Friday and its degree

distribution. Then we give the results of the ﬂight weight
distributions, of the clustering coeﬃcient, of the diameter
and of the assortative coeﬃcient, respectively. Finally a
summary is given.

The degree k of a given vertex is the number of ver-
tices linked to it. The spread in the vertex degree is
characterized by distribution function Pk, which gives
the probability that a randomly selected vertex has ex-
actly k edges [17]. Figure 1 shows a topological structure
of the Austrian airline ﬂight network on Friday, where
each airport is expressed by a node and the ﬂights are
connected by the lines between two nodes. The Vienna
airport is the dominative airport operated by the Aus-
trian airlines, which has naturally the largest amount of
edges. There are several major airports, such as Paris,
Frankfurt etc, which have frequent ﬂights to connect with
other small airports operated by the Austrian Airlines.

For comparison, the Erd¨os and R´enyi-type random net-
work structure which has the same vertices N = 136 and
mean degree hki = 1.31 is also plotted in the ﬁgure. The
obvious diﬀerent topological structure is there.

Figure 2 shows the three kinds of degree distributions
which the direction is concerned. Pk(in) and Pk(out) rep-
resent the frequencies of incoming and outgoing of ﬂights,
respectively. Pk(all) is used when we do not distinguish
outgoing and incoming ﬂights, i.e.
it is just the degree
number which is regardless wether the ﬂight is outgoing,
incoming, or both of them. Note that the present de-
gree distribution is not cumulative distribution as done
in Ref. [15, 16]. Even though the statistical ﬂuctuation
could keep large in degree distribution in comparison
with the cumulative distribution, the distribution can
give the direct probability how many Austrian Airline
ﬂights are coming or taking oﬀ.

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate two segments: the ﬁrst

one follows the power-law Pk ∼ k−γ when k < 7 and

the second one is the ﬂat tail distribution when k ≥ 7,
which is basically related to some largest airports which
serve for Austrian Airlines. This behavior can be par-
tially attributed to diﬀerent mechanisms between small
airports and large airports. For example, they have dif-
ferent growth rates since the construction of small air-
ports or the ﬂight line extension to small airports by the
Austrian Airlines is much easier and faster than that of
large airports. In the following, we can extract the expo-
nents of the degree distribution for small airports which
Austrian Airline covers. When k < 7, the mean weekly
value of γin, γout and γall correspond to 2.61, 2.63 and
2.47; Exponents in each day in Figure 2 are listed in Ta-
ble I. The average degree of the ﬂight network is given by
hki = 1
N Pi ki. The average hkiall = 1.30 . That means
each airport is linked to 1.3 other airports for the ﬂights
aﬃliated with Austrian Airlines. Similarly, hkiin = 1.279
and hkiout = 1.277. In details, hki on each day are listed
in Table I.

Our degree distributions are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
those of random graphs. In a random graph of the type
studied by Erd¨os and R´enyi, each edge is present or ab-
sent with equal probability, and hence the degree distri-
bution is binomial or Poisson distribution in the limit of
large graph size. Real-world networks are mostly found
to be very unlike the random graph in their degree dis-
tributions. The degrees of the vertices in most network
are highly right-skewed. This is the case of the present
ﬂight network. From the exponents γ of diﬀerent days
in a week as shown in Table I, we can ﬁnd that expo-
nents γin,out and γall on Saturday are the largest and on
Monday are basically the smallest. Similarly, the mean
degrees of ﬂights on Saturday and Monday are signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent:
it is the smallest on Saturday and the
largest on Monday, which is in consistent with the largest
value of γ on Saturday and the smallest on Monday. This
is also not contradicted with the diﬀerence of total day-
ﬂight number between Saturday and Monday as shown
in the same table. In other words, Monday is the busiest

n

ﬂight transportation day and Saturday is the most unoc-
cupied ﬂight transportation day for the Austrian Airline.
This can be partially related to the behavior of human
business travel.

Since the ﬂight network involves in transportation ﬂux,
the weight is important and can reﬂect some information
of the whole network. As shown in Fig. 3, the ﬂight
weight distribution in a week has a power-law distribu-
tion in the small weight branch,

Pn ∼ n−γf light ,

(2)

where n is the exact number of ﬂights between any given
airport i and j. The exponents of γf light of diﬀerent days
in a week are shown in Table I. The mean exponent of a
week is 1.33. Again, there is a diﬀerent value for working
days and weekend. The exponent γf light is around 1.2 in
working days but it shifts dramatically to larger values
on Saturday and Sunday (see Table I). Again, the value
of Saturday is the largest and the one of Monday is the
smallest. The larger γf light means the steep slope, which
results in the smaller mean weight. Therefore, the values
of larger γf light can be attributed to the declining ﬂight
number on weekends.

A common property of social networks is a clique form,
representing circles of friends or acquaintances. This in-
herent tendency to cluster is quantiﬁed by the clustering
coeﬃcient [10]. Let us focus ﬁrst on a selected vertex i
of the network, having ki edges which we call the nearest
neighbours of i. The maximum possible edges among ki
neighbours is ki(ki − 1) = 2. We use Nreal to denote
the number of edges that actually exist. The clustering
coeﬃcient of vertex i can be written as

Ci =

Nreal
ki(ki − 1)/2

(3)

and the clustering coeﬃcient of the entire network is
deﬁned as C = 1
N Pi Ci. The clustering coeﬃcient
C of the Austrian Airline ﬂight network in a week is
0.206. We also calculate C on each day (see Table 1).
In contrast, we compare C of our ﬂight network with
that of a random graph which has the same N and
hki. In such a random graph, the clustering coeﬃcient
is Crand = hki/N = p = 0.01 where p is the connection

probability. Thus, C in our ﬂight network is much larger
than that in a random graph.

Diameter called the characteristic path length in small-
world networks is the average shortest-path length be-
tween any two airports in the system [8]. The diameter
of our ﬂight network is deﬁned as

1

D =

N (N − 1) X
i6=j

dij

(4)

where dij is the minimum number of edges traversed from
vertex i to vertex j. The diameter of the ﬂight network
reﬂects the average number of least possible connections
between any two airports. The shortest path lengths of
the whole ﬂight network are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, with the
probability 0.018, 0.641, 0.278, 0.050 and 0.013, respec-
tively. This implies that from airport i to j, there will be
basically not more than three connections (the shortest-
path length of 1 means a direct ﬂight) where the prob-
ability is smaller than 10%. The diameter of our ﬂight
network is D = 2.383, which means that on the average
there will be 1.383 connections from airport i to j. Us-
ing the same approach, we compare the D of our ﬂight
network with that of the random graph. The diameter
of the random graph is Drand = ln(N)/ln(hki) = 18.67
[11]. In other word, the diameter of our ﬂight network
is signiﬁcantly smaller than the one of the random graph
with the same nodes and mean degree.

Many networks show assortative mixing on their de-
grees, i.e., a preference for high- degree vertices to attach
to other high-degree vertices, while others show disas-
sortative mixinghigh-degree vertices attach to low-degree
ones. Quantitatively, the degree-degree correlation coef-
ﬁcient (also called assortative coeﬃcient) can be written
as

r =

where ji and ki are the degrees of the vertices at the ends
of the ith edge, with i =1,..., M. As Newmann showed,
the values of r of the social networks have signiﬁcant as-
sortative mixing. By contrast, the technological and bio-
logical networks are all disassortative [18]. In this work,
we also check the coeﬃcient r and we list those values
of each day in Table 1. As we expected the values are
all negative, which means the ﬂight network is disassor-
tative. In other word, the large airports are likely to link
to smaller airports. This fact is in agreement with many
technological and biological networks [18]. The value of
Saturday shows the largest.

In summary, our analysis demonstrates that the Aus-
trian Airline ﬂight network displays the small-world prop-
erty: high clustering coeﬃcient and small diameter. The
clustering coeﬃcient C (0.206) is greatly larger than that
of a random network with the same N and hki (0.01 for
C) while the diameter D (2.383) of the ﬂight network is
rather small which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the value
of the same random network. The degree distribution
for small airports is power law with exponent 2.47 for
undirected ﬂight networks. Also the ﬂight weight dis-
tributions have power-law distribution with exponent of
approximately 1.33. Further, the network shows disas-
sortative behavior which indicates that the large airports
are likely to link to smaller airports. In a whole week, the
power-law exponents of the degree and the ﬂight weight
distributions show diﬀerent values for Monday and Sat-
urday. The smallest exponent for Monday corresponds to
the busiest ﬂight transportation day and the largest ex-
ponent on Saturday corresponds to the most unoccupied
ﬂight transportation day for the Austrian Airline.

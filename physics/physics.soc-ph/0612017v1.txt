Directed or Undirected? A New Index to Check
for Directionality of Relations in Socio-Economic Networks

Giorgio Fagiolo∗
(Dated: November 2006)
Abstract
This paper proposes a simple procedure to decide whether the empirically-observed adjacency or
weights matrix, which characterizes the graph underlying a socio-economic network, is suﬃciently
symmetric (respectively, asymmetric) to justify an undirected (respectively, directed) network anal-
ysis. We introduce a new index that satisﬁes two main properties. First, it can be applied to both
binary or weighted graphs. Second, once suitably standardized, it distributes as a standard nor-
mal over all possible adjacency/weights matrices. To test the index in practice, we present an
application that employs a set of well-known empirically-observed social and economic networks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the last years, the literature on networks has been characterized by exponential growth.
Empirical and theoretical contributions in very diverse ﬁelds such as physics, sociology,
economics, etc. have increasingly highlighted the pervasiveness of networked structures.
Examples range from WWW, the Internet, airline connections, scientiﬁc collaborations and
citations, trade and labor market contacts, friendship and other social relationships, business
relations and R&S partnerships, all the way through cellular, ecological and neural networks
[1, 2, 3, 4].

The empirical research has thoroughly studied the (often complex) topological properties
of such networks, whereas a large number of theoretical models has been proposed in order
to investigate how networks evolve through time [5]. Structural properties of networks
have been shown to heavily impact on the dynamics of the socio-economic systems that
they embed [6]. As a result, their understanding has become crucial also as far as policy
implications are concerned [7].

The simplest mathematical description of a network is in terms of a graph, that is a
list of nodes
and a set of arrows (links), possibly connecting any two nodes
[8, 9]. Alternatively, one can characterize a network through a N
N real-valued matrix
, where any out-of-diagonal entry wij is non-zero if and only if an arrow from
W =
node i to j exists in the network. Entries on the main diagonal are typically assumed to be
all diﬀerent from zero (if self-interactions are allowed) or all equal to zero (if they are not).
In binary networks all
Networks are distinguished in binary (dichotomous) or weighted.
links carry the same intensity. This means that in binary networks a link is either present or
not, i.e. wij
. In this case, W is called an “adjacency” matrix. Weighted networks
allow one instead to associate a weight (i.e. a positive real number) to each link, typically
proportional to its interaction strength or the ﬂux intensity it carries [10, 11, 12, 13]. Any
non-zero entry wij thus measures the weight of the link originating from i and ending up in
j, and the resulting matrix W is called the “weights” matrix [17].

}

Both binary and weighted networks can be undirected or directed. Formally, a network is
= j. This means that in undirected
undirected if all links are bilateral, i.e. wijwji > 0 for all i
networks all pairs of connected nodes mutually aﬀect each other. One can thus replace
arrows with non-directed edges (or arcs) connecting any two nodes and forget about the
implicit directions. This greatly simpliﬁes the analysis, as the tools for studying undirected
networks are much better developed and understood. Directed networks are instead not
symmetric, as there exists at least a pair of connected nodes wherein one directed link is not
= j : wij > 0, but wji = 0. Studying the topological properties
reciprocated, i.e.
of directed networks, especially in the weighted case, can become more diﬃcult, as one has
to distinguish inward from outward links in computing synthetic indices such as node and
average nearest-neighbor degree and strength, clustering coeﬃcient, etc.. Therefore, it is
not surprising that the properties of such indices are much less explored in the literature.

(i, j), i

From a theoretic perspective, it is easy to distinguish undirected from directed networks:
the network is undirected if and only if the matrix W is symmetric. When it comes to the
empirics, however, researchers often face the following problem. If the empirical network
concerns an intrinsically mutual social or economic relationship (e.g. friendship, marriage,
business partnerships, etc.) then W , as estimated by the data collected, is straightforwardly
symmetric and only tools designed for undirected network analysis are to be employed. More
generally, however, one deals with notionally non-mutual relationships, possibly entailing

directed networks. In that case, data usually allow to build a matrix W that, especially in
the weighted case, is hardly found to be symmetric. Strictly speaking, one should treat all
such networks as directed. This often implies a more complicated and convoluted analysis
and, frequently, less clear-cut results. The alternative, typically employed by practitioners in
the ﬁeld, is to compute the ratio of the number of directed (bilateral) links actually present
in the networks to the maximum number of possible directed links (i.e. N(N
1)). If this
ratio is “reasonably” large, then one can symmetrize the network (i.e. making it undirected,
see [3, 14]) and apply the relevant undirected network toolbox (for alternative techniques cf.
[15, 16]).

−

≃

This procedure has an important drawback.

If the network is weighted, the ratio of
bilateral links does not take into account the eﬀect of link weights.
Indeed, a bilateral
link exists between i and j if and only if wijwji > 0, i.e.
irrespective of the actual size
of the two weights. Of course, as far as symmetry of W is concerned, the sub-case where
wij >> 0, wji

0 will be very diﬀerent from the sub-case where wij

wji > 0.

In this paper, we present a simple procedure that tries to overcome this problem. More
speciﬁcally, we develop a simple index that can help in deciding when the empirically-
observed W is suﬃciently symmetric to justify an undirected network analysis. Our index
has two main properties. First, it can be applied with minor modiﬁcations to both binary and
weighted networks. Second, the standardized version of the index distributes as a standard
normal (over all possible matrices W ). Therefore, after having set a threshold x, one might
conclude that the network is to be treated as if it is undirected if the index computed on W
is lower than x.

≃

Of course, the procedure that we propose in the paper is by no means a statistical test for
the null hypothesis that W involves some kind of symmetry. Indeed, one has almost always
to rely on a single observation for W (more on that in Section V). Nevertheless, we believe
that the index studied here could possibly provide a simple way to ground the “directed vs.
undirected” decision on more solid bases.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we deﬁne the index and we derive its basic
properties. Section III discusses its statistical properties, while in Section IV we apply the
procedure to the empirical networks extensively studied in [3]. Finally, Section V concludes.

contrary, when there are no bilateral links, b(A) = 0. Hence,
S(A) = N −1

N +1, as shown in Lemma 1. Obviously, the
larger b(A), the more the graph G is undirected. As mentioned in Section I, b(A) can be
employed to check for the extent to which directionality counts in G. However, such index
is not very useful in weighted graphs, as it does not take into account the size eﬀect (i.e.
the size of weights as measured by aij

To do so, for each N

In this section we study the distribution of the index S as deﬁned in eqs. 3 and 8. Indeed,
despite the range of S does not depend on N, we expect its distribution to be aﬀected by:
(i) the size of the matrix (N); (ii) whether the underlying graph G is binary (aij
)
or weighted (aij

uniformly-distributed over [0, 1]. We then estimate the distributions of S in both the binary
and the weighted cases, and we study their behavior as the size of the graph increases. Let
us denote by mB(N) (respectively, mW (N)) the sample mean of the index S in the binary
(respectively, weighted) case, and by sB(N) (respectively, sW (N)) the sample standard
deviation of the index S in the binary (respectively, weighted) case. Simulation results are
summarized in the following points.

}

1. In both the binary and the weighted case, the index S approximately distributes as
a Beta random variable for all N. As N increases, mB(N) decreases towards 0.50
whereas mW (N) increases towards 0.25. Both standard deviations decrease towards
0. More precisely, the following approximate relations hold (see Figures 1 and 2):

both well approximated by a N(0, 1), even for small Ns (N
10). Indeed, as Figures
3 and 4 show, the mean of the distributions of SB and SW vs. N converges towards
zero, while the standard deviation approaches one (we actually plot standard deviation
minus one to have a plot in the same scale). Also the third (skewness) and the fourth
moment (excess kurtosis) stay close to zero. We also plot the estimated distribution
of SB and SW vs. N, see Figures 5 and 6. It can be seen that all estimated densities

and (m∗(N), s∗(N)) are as in eqs. 9-12. Since we know that S∗(X) is
where
approximately N(0, 1), we can ﬁx a lower threshold in order to decide whether the network
is suﬃciently (un)directed. For instance, we could set the lower threshold equal to 0 (i.e.
equal to the mean), and decide that if S∗(X) > 0 (above the mean) we shall treat the
network as directed (and undirected otherwise). More generally, one might set a threshold
R and conclude that the graph is undirected if S∗ < x. On the contrary, one
equal to x
should expect the directional nature of the graph to be suﬃciently strong, so that a digraph
analysis is called for.

To test the index against real-world cases, we have taken the thirteen social and economic
networks analyzed in [3], see Table I [19]. All networks are binary and directed, apart from

and undirected ). Table I reports both the index S and its standardized versions S∗,

Suppose to ﬁx the lower threshold equal to zero. Padgett’s networks, being undirected,
display a very low value (in fact, the non standardized index is equal to zero as expected).
The table also suggests to treat all the binary trade networks as undirected. The same advice
applies for Freeman’s networks, which are instead weighted. The only networks which have
an almost clear directed nature (according to our threshold) are Krackhardt’s ones. In that
case our index indicates that a directed graph analysis would be more appropriate.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we have proposed a new procedure that might help to decide whether an
empirically-observed adjacency or weights N
N matrix W , describing the graph underlying
×
a social or economic network, is suﬃciently symmetric to justify an undirected network
analysis. The index that we have developed has two main properties. First, it can be applied
to both binary or weighted graphs. Second, once suitably standardized, it distributes as a
standard normal over all possible adjacency/weights matrices. Therefore, given a threshold
decided by the researcher, any empirically observed adjacency/weights matrix displaying a
value of the index lower (respectively, higher) than the threshold is to be treated as if it
characterizes an undirected (respectively, directed) network.

It must be noticed that setting the threshold always relies on a personal choice, as also
happens in statistical hypothesis tests with the choice of the signiﬁcance level α. Despite
this unavoidable degree of freedom, the procedure proposed above still allows for a suﬃcient
comparability among results coming from diﬀerent studies (i.e. where researchers set diﬀer-
ent threshold) if both the value of the index S and the size of the network are documented
in the analysis. In that case, one can easily compute the probability of ﬁnding a matrix

9

with a lower/higher degree of symmetry, simply by using the deﬁnition of bounds (see eq.
15) and probability tables for the standard normal.

A ﬁnal remark is in order. As mentioned, our procedure does not conﬁgure itself as
a statistical test. Since the researcher often relies on a single observation of the network
under study (or a sequence of serially-correlated network snapshots through time), statistical
hypothesis testing will be only very rarely feasible. Nevertheless, in the case where a sample
of M i.i.d. observations of W is available, one might consider to use the the sample average
of the index (multiplied by √M ) and employ the cental limit theorem to test the hypothesis
that the observations come from a undirected (random) graph.

APPENDIX A: PROOF OF LEMMA 1

Points (1) and (2) simply follow from the deﬁnition in eq. 3. As to (3), let us suppose that
there exists a matrix A satisfying the above restrictions and such that

j6=i a2
The best case for such an inequality to be satisﬁed is when the the left hand side is minimized.
This is achieved when there are N(N
1)/2 entries
equal to zero in such a way that aij
= j (e.g., when the upper diagonal matrix
is made of all ones and the lower diagonal matrix is made of all zeroes). In that case the
left hand side is exactly equal to

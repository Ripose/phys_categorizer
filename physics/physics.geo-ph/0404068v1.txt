Abstract

The distribution of inter-occurrence time between seismic events is a
quantity of great interest in seismic risk assessment. We evaluate this
distribution for diﬀerent models of earthquakes occurrence and follow two
distinct approaches: The non homogeneous Poissonian and the non Pois-
sonian one.
In all cases we obtain either a power law or a power law
damped by an exponential factor behaviour. This feature of the distri-
bution makes impossible any prediction of earthquakes occurrence. Nev-
ertheless it suggests the interpretation of the earthquake occurrence phe-
nomenon as due to some non-linear dynamics to be further investigated.

1 Introduction

Seismology can be deﬁned as the science of earthquakes and studies mainly the
physics of the earthquakes sources, the elastic wave propagation and the occur-
rence of earthquakes in space, time and energy. The investigation of earthquakes
sources and wave propagation are based on the analysis of the seismograms un-
der the assumption that linear theory of elasticity holds and are treated in a
huge amount of literature (see e.g. Ref.
[1] and references therein). On the
other hand the study of earthquake occurrence regards the construction and
the investigation of seismic catalogues, whose content is generally the time of
occurrence, the location and the energy of earthquakes. The great interest dedi-
cated by many researchers to the statistics of these quantities is obviously linked
to the interest in predicting the time, the location and the energy of the next

1

earthquake. These questions are still rather unclear and we shall discuss some
aspects at the origin of the question. In particular, we suggest that diﬃculties
in prediction are intrinsic to the occurrence mechanism.

The energy release in a seismic event is generally expressed by the mag-
nitude, which is proportional to the logarithm of the maximum amplitude of
the recorded seismic signal. The distribution of magnitudes is described by an
exponential law usually referred as the Gutenberg-Richter distribution, by the
names of the researchers who ﬁrstly observed this feature of seismic catalogues.
They found that the frequency of occurrence of earthquakes with magnitude
greater then M behaves as

logN = a − bM

(1)

where a indicates the overall seismicity and b is a scaling parameter which
has typically values close to one. Fluctuations (up to 30%) of the value of b
around its typical value are widely observed depending on the catalogue, the
estimating method and the magnitude range [2]. Regional variation of the b
value are also observed by many authors (see e. g. [3, 4]). Such features could
be an indication that scaling properties of earthquakes are not universal.

However, it has been suggested that this discrepancy in b values could be
due to systematic errors in magnitude determination [5, 6]. For this reason, it is
often studied the distribution of the seismic moment M0 deﬁned as M0 = µA∆u
where µ is the shear modulus, A is the area of the seismic fault involved and ∆u
is the slip of the fault due to a single seismic event [6, 7, 2, 8, 9]. This is a more
physical quantity compared to the magnitude and can be obtained by inverting
the seismic signals with a standard procedure [10]. The cumulative distribution
of the seismic moment exhibit a power law behavior followed by a sharp cutoﬀ
after a M max

well represented by a Gamma distribution

value γ ≃ 0.7 [6, 11].

The fractal nature of the spatial distribution of earthquakes has been shown
for the CMT catalogue [12, 13] and the fractal dimension Df of the hypocenter
distribution has been determined. However, the fractal dimension could be not
suﬃcient to describe all the scaling properties in a given problem and a spectrum
of dimensions turns out to be necessary in order to fully characterize the scaling
behavior. If this happens, the distribution is said to be multifractal [14].It has
been shown [15, 16] that the spatial distributions of earthquakes in Kanto region,
in eastern Japan, in California and in Greece have a multifractal structure. The
multifractal distribution of earthquakes hypocenters has been also conﬁrmed for
some Italian regions [17, 18] and it has been suggested [19, 20] that the temporal
changes of Df could be a good precursor parameter for earthquake occurrence
prediction.

On the other hand, the rate of occurrence of seismic events in time has been
[21, 22, 23]) because the existence of a charac-

widely investigated (see e.g.

nian catalogue of earthquakes (De Natale et al., 2003), b)the Colﬁorito (Italy)
sequence(De Natale et al., 2003).

teristic time scale could make possible the prediction of the next earthquake.
Unfortunately this is not the case since the distribution of waiting times between
earthquakes exhibits a two power law behavior [24, 25, 26](ﬁgure 1). More pre-
cisely, the data exhibit a ﬁrst power law regime with an exponent close to 0.8
for both catalogues, followed by a second power law with an exponent 1.8 for
Colﬁorito and 2.6 for California. The experimental results suggest that inter-
arrival times are possible at all time scales, making the prediction of earthquakes
occurrence extremely diﬃcult. The non-Poissonian behavior of earthquake oc-
currence is clearly due to the phenomenon of clustering, suggested by the power
law distribution of the inter-arrival times. In fact, for a Poissonian process, the
distribution would have an exponential behavior.

The existence of power law behaviors and the multifractal distribution of
hypocenters, leads to the interpretation of earthquake as a critical phenomenon
[27, 28, 29], proposing a new point of view for the features of earthquake occur-
rence.

Finally in recent years it has been proposed that Self Organized Criticality
(SOC) [30] could explain the observed self - similar properties of earthquakes
[27, 28], in particular could be able to reproduce the earthquake size distri-
bution. Within this approach, the lithosphere structure derives from the self-
organization of the earth crust in a continental plate. A ﬁeld theory can be also
derived from symmetry and conservation laws to explain the earthquakes size
distribution and viewing the earthquakes as ﬂuctuation of the elastic energy in
the crust [31].

In this paper we focus on the waiting time distribution, we derive the ana-
lytical expression of the inter-arrival time distribution for some existing models
and we discuss the scaling behavior of the distributions depending on parame-
ters. More precisely, in Section 2 we shortly present some of the most commonly
used models and, in section 3, we derive the analytical expression of the prob-
ability density function using a non homogeneous Poissonian approach for the
Omori law and the ETAS (Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequences) model.
In
section 4 we derive the p.d.f. using a non Poissonian approach for the Omori
law and the Poisson Generalized model. In all the cases there exists a choice of
the parameters ﬁtting some data set. In the ﬁnal section we present conclusions
and considerations for earthquakes occurrence prediction.

2 The earthquake clustering and the Omori law

It is widely observed that earthquakes tend to occur in bursts. These bursts may
start suddenly immediately following a large main event, giving rise to the well
known main - aftershocks sequences, or may build up and die very gradually in

3

time, generating swarms of events. The most important implication of this kind
of occurrence is that we cannot assume a Poissonian occurrence of earthquakes,
where a Poissonian process is characterized by a constant rate of occurrence,
but rather a clustered one. In his pioneering paper, Omori [32] investigated the
problem of earthquake occurrence within a single cluster of events and proposed
that the non-Poissonian behavior of seismic catalogues could be well ﬁtted with
the Omori law, stating that the number of aftershocks n(t) decays in time as

n(t) =

k
(t + c)p

where p is generally very close to 1 ranging from 0.7 to 1.7, c is an initial
time introduced in order to avoid the divergence at t = 0 and k = n(0)cp is an
experimental constant.

A widely used approach to earthquakes clustering is provided by ”trigger
model” [33]. This assumes a Poissonian occurrence of main events, whereas the
occurrence of the ”triggered” earthquakes is described in terms of a correlation
function g(t − ti), where ti is the time of occurrence of the i-th event. The
function g(t − ti) describes the correlation of each event occurring at time t
with all the events occurred at previous times. Thus the rate of occurrence will
be

where µ is the Poissonian rate of the main events. Among the trigger mod-
els a widely used one is the Poisson Generalised model [34]: this assumes the
sequence of events as composed by uncorrelated main events which generate
clusters of aftershocks distributed as the Pareto power law [33]

λ = µ +

g(t − ti)

Xi:ti<t

q(j) =

j−β
ζ(β)

where ζ(β) is the Riemann function and j is the number of events in the
cluster. This approach has been applied for many areas of the world, as Cali-
fornia [34], Messina Strait area [35] and Campi Flegrei (Italy) [36], in order to
determine the β value, found to be between 2.5 and 4.

A more appropriate choice of g(t − ti) is provided by the ETAS model [37],
which considers the existence of many clusters described by the Omori law.
The model states that the intensity function (the rate of occurrence) of the
earthquakes is given by:

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

where µ is again the Poissonian rate , α an experimental constant, M0 is the
smallest magnitude in the catalogue and Mi is the magnitude of the i-th event.
The meaning of equation (6) is that each earthquake can generate ”its own

aftershocks” and that the number of these aftershocks depends exponentially
on the magnitude of the ”main”. In other words the clustering degree varies in
time, leading to a clustering within the clustering.

A completely diﬀerent approach is the fractal one [25]. A Poissonian pro-
cess would ﬁll stochastically all the temporal axis and thus would have a fractal
dimension equal to 1, whereas a clustered process is characterized by a frac-
tal dimension less then one depending on the clustering degree. Using the box
counting method it has been found that the New Hebrides seismicity is clus-
tered with a fractal dimension ranging between 0.126 and 0.255[25]. Moreover
other authors [38] found that many catalogues in the world have a multifractal
distribution of inter-arrival times. This result is in good agreement with the
predictions of the ETAS model.

3 The non homogeneous Poissonian approach

The problem of earthquakes inter-arrival time distribution has never been treated
from the theoretical point of view. In order to explain the temporal clustering
properties of seismic events occurrence, the most of eﬀorts were dedicated to
the study of the rate of occurrence. Nevertheless the waiting time distribution
is very important in the seismic risk assessment because it is very useful in the
deﬁnition of the probability of the occurrence of next earthquake. In this section
we derive the distribution of the waiting times for a single cluster following the
Omori law and for the ETAS model.

The cumulative distribution of waiting times F (∆t) can be written as [39]

F (∆t) = 1 − F0(∆t)

where F0(∆t) is the probability of observing zero events in ∆t. Since for a

Poissonian process

the probability density function (p.d.f.) is found to be

F0(∆t) = e−µ∆t

f (∆t) =

dF (∆t)
d∆t

= µe−µ∆t

which is the well known result for a Poissonian process.
This approach can be generalized also for processes for which µ is not con-
stant in time and we shall have a non homogeneous Poissonian process. In this
case the probability of having zero events in ∆t is given by

F0(∆t) = e−

∆t

0

λ(t)dt

R
where λ(t) is the time dependent rate of occurrence thus inserting the (10)
into the (7) and the result into the (9) we obtain the waiting times p.d.f. Note
that the Poissonian behavior is more restrictive then the independence of events,

values of the model parameter

since it is obtained under the assumption that the probability of observing more
than one event in any small time interval, is negligible.

As a ﬁrst application of this approach we shall derive the waiting time dis-
tribution within a cluster of events. In this case the rate of occurrence λ(t) is
given by the Omori law, thus for p 6= 1

which, except for some constant factors, is a Weibull distribution, i.e. a
power law damped by a stretched exponential decay. Figure 2 shows the p.d.f.
for diﬀerent parameter value: the Omori law exponent p controls the decaying
exponential factor which is dominant at long times for (∆t + c)1−p > 1−p
k when
p < 1 and at short times for (∆t + c)1−p < 1−p
k when p > 1. We observe that
the p.d.f. for p > 1 are not in agreement with experimental observations.

which is a power law and does not exhibit any exponential decay as equation

A more complex formula is obtained if we adopt the ETAS model. In this
case we consider the existence of many clusters of events as described in section
2. The rate of occurrence is given by the equation (6). If we take the continuum

Equation (17) is well deﬁned i.e. is a positive quantity, only for p > 1 and

assumes the shape of a Weibull distribution (ﬁgure 3).

Analogously the case p = 1 gives

F0(∆t) = cck(∆t + c)−cke−∆t(µ+kln c+∆t
4∆t )

and for the p.d.f.

f (∆t) =

µ + kln

c + ∆t

4∆t i

cck(∆t + c)−cke−∆t(µ+kln c+∆t

(19)

We ﬁnd again a power law damped by an exponential factor. Note that the
term in the square brackets is negative for µ < kln c+∆t
4∆t because c + ∆t < 4∆t,
however it is possible to obtain positive values of the p.d.f. for k < 0.36 if we
set µ = 0.5 (ﬁgure 4).

It is noteworthy that the non homogeneous Poissonian approach does not
provide a good agreement with experimental data since does not predict the
two power regime shown in ﬁgure 1. This feature could be due to the Poisso-
nian assumption which assumes negligibly small the probability of two events
occurring in any small time interval.

4 The non Poissonian approach

In this Section we derive the analytical expression of the p.d.f. assuming only
that the probability of cluster occurrence is independent on the probability of
earthquake occurrence within a cluster. If we call Qn(∆t) the probability of
having n events in a cluster and PN (∆t) the probability of having N clusters in
∆t, we will have

F0(∆t) = P0(∆t)Qn(∆t)+

P0(∆t)[1 − Qn(∆t)] + PN (∆t)[1 − Qn(∆t)]

(20)

The three terms in equation (20) represent respectively the probability of
having zero clusters of n events, zero clusters of zero events and N clusters of
zero events. Firstly we determine the p.d.f. of the ∆t within a single cluster.

7

In this case PN (∆t) = 1 and P0(∆t) = 0. The number of events j in a time
interval τ for p 6= 1 will be given by

(∆t + c)−β(1−p)

which is a power law well deﬁned only for p < 1. This constraint is due to
the assumption that c1−p ≪ (τ + c)1−p, which implies from (21) that, if p > 1,
the number of events j would became negative. In the case p = 1 we obtain a
p.d.f. whose behavior is inconsistent with the experimental data and thus will
not be reported here.

Next we apply the non Poissonian approach to the ”trigger” model which
assumes a Poissonian occurrence of clusters and a power law decrease of the
number of events within the clusters (equation (5)). Under these assumptions
we have

φ(x) = (b + c)−δ − (c + x)δ. Equation (27) is a very complex function and
does not allow any simple ﬁt of experimental data. Moreover the number of
parameters involved in the function is too high for a stable ﬁt. However we
notice that it is possible to ﬁnd some plausible relations among some of the
parameters. For instance, µ and k can be related since they are both rates of
occurrence: the ﬁrst one concerns the cluster occurrence, whereas the second
one states how many earthquakes occur at the beginning of a given cluster. In
order to evaluate equation (27), we choose k = 20µ. Any other choice for k
and µ does not inﬂuence the shape of equation (28), but only the level of the
seismicity, that is the total number of events. Obviously the value of µ and k,
representing the time scale in the system, implies as a consequence the value of
the constant c of the Omori law and therefore we choose c = 0.3/k. This means
that we have three free parameters µ, β and p. By varying these parameters,
we obtain two possible behaviors: either a two power law regime or a two power
law regime damped by an exponential decay at high ∆t.

In ﬁgure 5 we show the p.d.f. with ﬁxed β and p for diﬀerent values of µ.
At lower values of µ, therefore for clusters more sparse in time, we observe the
two power law regimes behavior, whereas for increasing µ we observe the onset
of an exponential cut-oﬀ at long waiting times. Note that the exponents are in
the range 0.2 - 0.5 for the ﬁrst power law and 1.3 - 1.9 for the second one.

Figure 6 shows the behavior of p.d.f. at ﬁxed β and µ for a range of values of
p. In this case we observe for decreasing values of the Omori exponent p, i.e. for
clusters lasting a longer time, the onset of an exponential cut-oﬀ at long waiting
times after the two power law regime. In this case the exponents vary between
0.4 and 0.7 for the ﬁrst power law and between 1.0 and 1.3 for the second
one. Any variation of the parameter values does not change substantially the
behavior in ﬁgures 5 and 6. On the contrary, we will see that the p.d.f. function
is more sensitive to combined variations of β and p.

Figure 7 shows for p = 0.75 the onset of an exponential cut-oﬀ at long
waiting times for high values of β as observed in ﬁgures 5 and 6 (slopes are in

the ranges 0.5 - 0.7 and 1.6 - 1.4). On the other hand, for p = 0.95 the two
power law behavior is substantially insensitive to β variations (ﬁgure 8). This
suggests that scaling properties of equation (27) are dominated mainly by p
than by β. In this case the power law exponents are 0.4 and 1.0.

The two power law regime is widely observed for many catalogues in the
world (ﬁgure 1) and generally interpreted as due to catalogue incompleteness.
Within the Poissonian Generalised approach we ﬁnd that the two power law be-
havior is quite robust with respect to parameter changes. Therefore we suggest
that this feature is an intrinsic property of earthquake occurrence related to the
P. G. model.

5 Conclusions

We evaluate the probability density function of the inter-occurrence time be-
tween earthquakes following two diﬀerent approaches. We ﬁrst assume a non
homogeneous Poissonian behavior and ﬁnd for diﬀerent models of earthquakes
occurrence always a single power law, eventually followed by an exponential
decay.

Next we investigate a non Poissonian approach for diﬀerent models. The
obtained p.d.f. has a power law behavior in the case of a single cluster of
events described by the Omori law. On the contrary, in the case of the Poisson
Generalised model the p.d.f. exhibit a more complex behavior depending on
parameters. For all values of p 6= 1 we ﬁnd consistently a two power law regime.
This situation, occurring for small µ, corresponds to long waiting times between
clusters of seismic events, which is the situation more frequently observed in
nature. Depending on parameters, the value of the exponents are in agreement
with the experimental data.

Moreover, for high values of β, i.e.

fast decay in the number of events in
a single cluster, and a high Poissonian rate µ the two power laws are followed
by an exponential decay. This feature characterizes a weak clustering in the
distribution of events in time or a frequent cluster occurrence.

The two power law behavior is observed for many catalogues relatives to
diﬀerent areas in the world. This feature, often interpreted as a sign of the
incompleteness of the catalogue, is here obtained as a speciﬁc characteristics of
the p.d.f. for the Poisson Generalised model. Finally we notice that for all the
discussed approaches and model the power law behavior implies the absence of a
characteristic inter-occurrence time and therefore impossibility of any prediction

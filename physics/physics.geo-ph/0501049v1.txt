Abstract.

In models of triggered seismicity and in their inversion with empirical data, the de-
tection threshold md is commonly equated to the magnitude m0 of the smallest trigger-
ing earthquake. This unjustiﬁed assumption neglects the possibility of shocks below the
detection threshold triggering observable events. We introduce a formalism that distin-
guishes between the detection threshold md and the minimum triggering earthquake m0 ≤
md. By considering the branching structure of one complete cascade of triggered events,
we derive the apparent branching ratio na (which is the apparent fraction of aftershocks
in a given catalog) and the apparent background source Sa that are observed when only
the structure above the detection threshold md is known due to the presence of smaller
undetected events that are capable of triggering larger events. If earthquake triggering
is controlled in large part by the smallest magnitudes as several recent analyses have shown,
this implies that previous estimates of the clustering parameters may signiﬁcantly un-
derestimate the true values: for instance, an observed fraction of 55% of aftershocks is
renormalized into a true value of 75% of triggered events.

1. Introduction

There are numerous evidences that a seismic event can
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the pattern of subsequent seis-
micity, most obvious in aftershocks of large events. More
recently has emerged an important extension of the con-
cept of earthquake interactions in the concept of triggered
seismicity, in which the usual distinction, that foreshocks
are precursors of larger mainshocks which in turn trig-
ger smaller aftershocks, becomes blurred: a parsimonious
and eﬃcient description of seismicity does not seem to re-
quire the division between foreshocks, mainshocks and af-
tershocks, which appear indistinguishable from the point
of view of many of their physical and statistical proper-
ties [Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003a]. An important logical
consequence is that cascades of triggered seismicity (“after-
shocks,” “aftershocks” of “aftershocks,” ...) may play an
important role in the overall seismicity budget [Helmstetter
and Sornette, 2003b; Felzer et al., 2002].

There is thus a growing interest in phenomenological
models of triggered seismicity, which use the Omori law
as the best coarse-grained proxy for modeling the com-
plex and multi-faceted interactions between earthquakes, to-
gether with the other most solid stylized facts of seismic-
ity (clustering in space, the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) earth-
quake size distribution and an aftershock productivity law).
This class of ETAS (Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequences)
models introduced by Ogata [1988] and Kagan and Knopoﬀ
[1981] oﬀers a parsimonious approach replacing the classi-
ﬁcation of foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks by the
concept of earthquake triggering: earthquakes may trigger

other earthquakes through a variety of physical mechanisms
but the eﬀective laws do not allow the identiﬁcation of a
particular mechanism.

The questions suggested by this approach include: 1)
what is the fraction of triggered versus uncorrelated earth-
quakes (which is linked to the problem of clustering)? How
can one use this modeling approach to forecast future seis-
micity? What are the limits of predictability and how are
they sensitive to catalog completeness and type of tectonic
deformation? In general, to attack any such question, one
needs in one way or another to estimate some key parame-
ters of the models of triggered seismicity.

The royal path is in principle to use the maximum likeli-
hood method to estimate the parameters of the considered
model from a catalog of seismicity (time, location and mag-
nitude) (see for instance Ogata [1988] and Kagan [1991]).
The calculation of the likelihood function requires evaluat-
ing the theoretical rate of seismicity at time t induced by all
past events at times ti < t. The maximization of the like-
lihood with respect to the parameters of the model, given
the data, then provides an estimate of the parameters. All
previous studies have considered that small earthquakes, be-
low the detection threshold, are negligible. Thus, the rate of
seismicity is calculated as if triggered only by earthquakes
above the detection threshold. However, this method is not
correct because it does not take into account events below
the detection threshold, which may have an important role
in the triggering of seismicity.
Indeed, small earthquakes
have a signiﬁcant contribution in earthquake triggering be-
cause they are much more numerous than larger earthquakes
(Helmstetter [2003]; Felzer et al.
[2002]; Helmstetter et al.
[2004]). This can simply be seen from the competition
between the productivity law ∼ 10αM giving the number
of events triggered by a mainshock of magnitude M and
the relative abundance ∼ 10−bM of such mainshocks given
by the Gutenberg-Richter law: the contribution of earth-
quakes of magnitude M to the overall seismic rate is thus

X - 2

SORNETTE AND WERNER: APPARENT CLUSTERING AND BACKGROUND EVENTS

∼ 10−(b−α)M , which is dominated by small M ’s for α < b
[Helmstetter, 2003] or equally contributed by each magni-
tude class for α = b (Felzer et al.
[2002]; Helmstetter et
al. [2004]). Therefore, one needs to take into account small
events that are not observed in order to calibrate correctly
models of seismicity and obtain reliable answers to our ques-
tions stated above. This is an essential bottleneck for the
development of earthquake forecasts based on such models.
The purpose of this note is to present a general theoreti-
cal treatment of the impact of unobserved seismicity within
the framework of models of triggered seismicity. We show
by analyzing the branching structure of a complete cascade
(cluster) triggered by an independent background event that
the unobserved seismicity has the eﬀect of decreasing the
real branching ratio n and of increasing the number of in-
dependent background events S into apparent quantities na
and Sa. This bias may be very signiﬁcant. We therefore
claim that previous work should be reanalyzed from the new
perspective of our approach. This leads also to important
consequences for the methods presently used to forecast fu-
ture seismicity based only on incomplete catalogs.

2. The ETAS model and the smallest
triggering earthquake

2.1. Deﬁnition of the ETAS model

To make this discussion precise,

let us consider the
epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, in which
any earthquake may trigger other earthquakes, which in turn
may trigger more, and so on. Introduced in slightly diﬀerent
forms by Kagan and Knopoﬀ [1981] and Ogata [1988], the
model describes statistically the spatio-temporal clustering
of seismicity.

The triggering process may be caused by various mecha-
nisms that either compete or combine, such as pore-pressure
changes due to pore-ﬂuid ﬂows coupled with stress varia-
tions, slow redistribution of stress by aseismic creep, rate-
and-state dependent friction within faults, coupling between
the viscoelastic lower crust and the brittle upper crust,
stress-assisted micro-crack corrosion, and more. The ETAS
formulation amounts to a two-scale description: these above
physical processes controlling earthquake interactions enter
in the determination of eﬀective triggering laws in a ﬁrst
step and the overall seismicity is then seen to result from
the cascade of triggering of events triggering other events
triggering other events and so on [Helmstetter and Sornette,
2002].

The ETAS model consists of three assumed laws about
the nature of seismicity viewed as a marked point-process.
We restrict this study to the temporal domain only, sum-
ming over the whole spatial domain of interest. First, the
magnitude of any earthquake, regardless of time, location,
or magnitude of the mother shock, is drawn randomly from
the exponential Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law. Its normal-
ized probability density function (pdf) is expressed as

b ln(10)10−bm

P (m) =

10−bm0 − 10−bmmax , m0 ≤ m ≤ mmax,

(1)

where the exponent b is typically close to one, and the cut-
oﬀs m0 and mmax serve to normalize the pdf. The upper
cut-oﬀ mmax is introduced to avoid unphysical, inﬁnitely
Its value was estimated to be in the
large earthquakes.
range 8 − 9.5 [Kagan, 1999]. As the impact of a ﬁnite mmax
is quite weak in the calculations below, replacing the abrupt
cut-oﬀ mmax by a smooth taper would introduce negligible
corrections to our results.

Second, the model assumes that direct aftershocks are dis-
tributed in time according to the modiﬁed “direct” Omori
law (see Utsu et al. [1995] and references therein). Assuming

θ > 0, the normalized pdf of the Omori law can be written
as

Ψ(t) =

θcθ
(t + c)1+θ .

(2)

Third, the number of direct aftershocks of an event of

magnitude m is assumed to follow the productivity law:

ρ(m) = k10α(m−m0 ), m0 ≤ m ≤ mmax.

(3)

Note that the productivity law (3) is zero below the cut-
oﬀ m0, i.e.
earthquakes smaller than m0 do not trigger
other earthquakes, as is typically assumed in studies using
the ETAS model. The existence of the small magnitude
cut-oﬀ m0 is necessary to ensure the convergence of these
types of models of triggered seismicity (in statistical physics
of phase transitions and in particle physics, this is called
an “ultra-violet” cut-oﬀ which is often necessary to make
the theory convergent). In a closely related paper, Sornette
and Werner [2004] showed that the existence of the cut-oﬀ
m0 has observable consequences which constrain its physical
value.

The key parameter of the ETAS model is deﬁned as the
number n of direct aftershocks per earthquake, averaged
over all magnitudes. Here, we must distinguish between the
two cases α = b and α 6= b:

n ≡

P (m)ρ(m)dm

mmax

Z
m0

=

kb
b − α

(

1 − 10−(b−α)(mmax −m0)
1 − 10−b(mmax −m0)

),

(4)

(5)

for the general case α 6= b. The special case α = b gives

n =

kb ln(10)(mmax − m0)
1 − 10−b(mmax −m0)

Three regimes can be distinguished based on the value of
n. The case n < 1 corresponds to the subcritical, stationary
regime, where aftershock sequences die out with probability
one. The case n > 1 describes unbounded, exponentially
growing seismicity [Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002]. In ad-
dition, the case b < α leads to explosive seismicity with ﬁnite
time singularities [Sornette and Helmstetter, 2002]. The crit-
ical case n = 1 separates the two regimes n < 1 and n > 1.
Helmstetter and Sornette [2003b] showed that the branching
ratio n is also equal to the fraction of triggered events in a
seismic catalog.

The fact that we use the same value for the productiv-
ity cut-oﬀ and the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) cut-oﬀ is not
a restriction as long as the real cut-oﬀ for the Gutenberg-
Richter law is smaller than or equal to the cut-oﬀ for the
productivity law.
In that case, truncating the GR law at
the productivity cut-oﬀ just means that all smaller earth-
quakes, which do not trigger any events, do not participate
in the cascade of triggered events. This should not be con-
fused with the standard incorrect procedure in many pre-
vious studies of triggered seismicity of simply replacing the
GR and productivity cut-oﬀ m0 with the detection thresh-
old md in equations (1) and (3) (see, for example, Ogata
[1988]; Kagan [1991]; Ogata [1998]; Console et al.
[2003];
Zhuang et al. [2004]). The assumption that md = m0 may
lead to a bias in the estimated parameters.

Without loss of generality, we consider one independent
branch (cluster or cascade of aftershocks set oﬀ by a back-
ground event) of the ETAS model. Let thus an independent
background event of magnitude M1 occur at some origin

of time. The mainshock will trigger direct aftershocks ac-
cording to the productivity law (3). Each of the direct af-
tershocks will trigger their own aftershocks, which in turn
produce their own, and so on. Averaged over all magni-
tudes, an aftershock produces n direct oﬀsprings according
to (4). Thus, in inﬁnite time, we can write the average of
the total number Ntotal of direct and indirect aftershocks of
the initial mainshock as an inﬁnite sum over terms of (3)
multiplied by n to the power of the generation [Helmstetter
and Sornette, 2003b], which can be expressed for n < 1 as:

Ntotal = ρ(M1) + ρ(M1)n + ρ(M1)n2 + ...

=

k10α(M1−m0)
1 − n

However, since we can only detect events above the detection
threshold md, the total number of observed aftershocks Nobs
of the sequence is simply Ntotal multiplied by the fraction
of events above the detection threshold, given by

fobs =

10b(mmax −md) − 1
10b(mmax −m0) − 1

according to the GR distribution. The observed number of
events in the sequence is therefore

Nobs = Ntotalfobs

=

k10α(M1−m0)
1 − n

10b(mmax −md) − 1
10b(mmax −m0) − 1 (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

Equation (8) predicts the average observed number of di-
rect and indirect aftershocks of a mainshock of magnitude
M1 > md. Sornette and Werner [2004] showed that m0
may be estimated using ﬁts of Nobs given by (8) to observed
aftershock sequences and B˚ath’s law. The essential param-
eter needed to constrain m0 is the branching ratio n. As we
demonstrate below, typical estimates of n in the literature
obtained from a catalog neglect undetected seismicity and
therefore cannot be used directly to constrain m0.

[2003]; Zhuang et al.

Naturally, there is no justiﬁcation for assuming that md
should equal m0, as is done routinely in inversions of cata-
logs for the parameters of the ETAS model (see, for exam-
ple, Ogata [1988]; Kagan [1991]; Ogata [1998]; Console et
al.
[2004]). First, detection thresh-
olds change over time as instruments and network coverage
become better, while the physical mechanisms in the Earth
presumably remain the same. No signiﬁcant deviation from
the Gutenberg-Richter distribution or the productivity law
has been recorded as the detection threshold md decreased
over time. Second, studies of earthquake occurrence at small
magnitude levels below the regional network cut-oﬀs show
that earthquakes follow the same Gutenberg-Richter law (for
a recent study of mining-induced seismicity, see, for exam-
ple, Sellers et al.
[2003]), while acoustic emission experi-
ments have shown the relevance of the Omori law at small
scales (see, for instance Nechad et al. [2004] and references
therein). Within the assumption of self-similarity, i.e. a con-
tinuation of the GR and productivity laws down to a cut-oﬀ,
evidence thus points towards a magnitude of the smallest
triggering earthquake and a Gutenberg-Richter cut-oﬀ that
lie below the detection threshold and are thus not directly
observable.

2.2. Two interpretations of the ETAS model

The ETAS model may be viewed in two mathematically
equivalent but interpretionally diﬀerent ways. In this sec-
tion, we develop both views to underline that our results ap-
ply in both cases and to stress the equivalence of these two
views. The ﬁrst describes the model as a simple branching
model without loops: The independent background events,

due to tectonic loading, may each independently trigger di-
rect aftershocks, each of which may in turn trigger secondary
shocks, which in turn may trigger more. Because every
triggered event, excluding of course the non-triggered back-
ground events, has exactly one mainshock (mother), but
the mother may have many direct aftershocks (children),
the model can be thought of as a simple branching model
without loops. The background events are assumed to be a
stationary Poisson process with a constant rate. The rate
of the aftershocks of a background event is a non-stationary
Poisson process that is updated every time another after-
shock occurs until the cascade dies out. The intensity is
thus conditioned on the speciﬁc history of earthquakes. The
expectation of the conditional intensity is an average over
an ensemble of histories. The predicted number of after-
shocks of an independent background event of magnitude
M1 as in expression (8) is thus averaged over the ensemble
of possible realizations of the aftershock sequence, and it is
also averaged over all possible magnitudes of the aftershocks.
The branching ratio n is therefore an average not only over
magnitudes but also over an ensemble of realizations of the
non-stationary Poisson process. The model thus consists of
statistically independent Poisson clusters of events, which
are, however, dependent within one cluster.

The second view of the ETAS model does not allow a
unique identiﬁcation of the mother or trigger of an earth-
quake. Rather, each aftershock was triggered collectively by
all previous earthquakes, each of which contributes a weight
determined by the magnitude-dependent productivity law
ρ(m) that decays in time according to the Omori law ψ(t)
and in space according to a spatial function R(r), often cho-
sen to be an exponential or a power law centered on the
event. The instantaneous conditional intensity rate at some
time t at location r is given by

λ(t, r) = µ +

ρ(mi)ψ(t − ti)R(r − ri)

(9)

Xi|ti<t

where the sum runs over all previous events i with mag-
nitude mi at time ti at location ri. Thus the triggering
contribution of a previous event to a later event at time t is
given by its own weight (its speciﬁc entry in the sum) divided
by the total seismicity rate, including the background rate.
A non-zero background rate then contributes evenly to all
events and corresponds to an omnipresent loading contribu-
tion. In this way, earthquakes are seen to be the result of all
previous activity including the background rate. This cor-
responds to a branching model in which every earthquake
links to all subsequent earthquakes weighted according to
the contribution to triggering. A branching ratio can then be
interpreted as a contribution of a past earthquake to a future
earthquake, averaged over an ensemble of realizations and
all magnitudes. This second view becomes the only possible
one for nonlinear models whose triggering functions depend
nonlinearly on previous events (see e.g. the recently intro-
duced multi-fractal earthquake triggering model by Ouillon
and Sornette [2004] and references therein).

These two views are equivalent because the linear formu-
lation of the seismic rate of the ETAS model together with
the exponential Poisson process ensures that the statisti-
cal properties of the resulting earthquake catalogs are the
same. The linear sum over the individual contributions and
the Poisson process formulation are the key ingredients that
allow the model to be viewed as a simple branching model.
This duality of thinking about the ETAS model is re-
ﬂected in the existence of two simulation codes in the com-
munity, each inspired by one of the two views. A program
written by K. Felzer and Y. Gu (personal communication)
calculates the background events as a stationary Poisson

X - 4

SORNETTE AND WERNER: APPARENT CLUSTERING AND BACKGROUND EVENTS

process and then simulates each cascade independently of
the other branches as a non-stationary process. The sec-
ond code by Ogata [1998], on the other hand, calculates the
overall seismicity at each point in time by summing over all
previous activity. The latter code is signiﬁcantly slower be-
cause the independence between cascades is not used, and
the entire catalog is modeled as the sum of a stationary and
a non-stationary process. Despite the diﬀerent approach,
both resulting earthquake catalogs share the same statisti-
cal properties and are thus equally acceptable.
In the in-
terpretation of the model as a simple branching model, the
parameter n deﬁned in (4) would correspond to a branch-
ing ratio, while the view that aftershocks are triggered col-
lectively by all previous earthquakes and the background
rate would interpret n as an average contribution of a single
earthquake on future earthquakes. The important point is
that the statistical properties are the same.

While the simulation or forward problem is straight-
forward when adopting the view of the ETAS model as a
branching model with one assigned trigger for any after-
shock, the inverse problem of reconstructing the branching
structure from a given catalog can at best be probabilistic.
Because aftershocks of one mother cannot be distinguished
from those of another mother except by spatio-temporal dis-
tance, we have no way of choosing which previous earth-
quake triggered a particular event, or whether it is a back-
ground event. Rather, we must resort to calculating the
probability of an event at time t to be triggered by any
previous event according to the contribution that the previ-
ous event has at time t compared to the overall intensity at
time t. This probability is of course equal to the weight or
triggering contribution that a previous event has on a sub-
sequent event when adopting the collective-triggering view.
However, the interpretation remains diﬀerent since the prob-
ability speciﬁes a unique mother in a fraction of many real-
izations.

Having determined from catalogs a branching structure
weighted according to the probability of triggering, one may
of course choose to always pick as source of an event the most
probable contributor, be that a previous event or the back-
ground rate. Another option is to choose randomly accord-
ing to the probability distribution and thus reconstruct one
possible branching structure among the ensemble of many
other possible ones. The latter approach has been used by
Zhuang et al. [2004] and labeled stochastic reconstruction.
The key point is that equating the detection threshold
with the smallest triggering earthquake will most likely lead
to a bias in the recovered parameters of a maximum likeli-
hood analysis as performed by Zhuang et al. [2004] and in
many other studies. Therefore, the weights or probabilities
of previous events triggering subsequent events were calcu-
lated from biased parameters.

In the following, we show that the branching ratio and
the background source events are signiﬁcantly biased when
they are estimated from the apparent branching structure
observed above the detection threshold md instead of the
complete tree structure down to m0. We adopt the view of
the simple branching model to make the derivations more
illuminating but all results can be reinterpreted as contribu-
tions in the collective-triggering view.

3. The Apparent Branching Structure of
the ETAS Model
3.1. The apparent branching ratio na

Seismic catalogs are usually considered complete above a
threshold md, which varies as a function of technology and
location. For instance, md ≈ 2 for modern Southern Califor-
nia catalogs (and for earthquakes not too close in time to a
large mainshock [Kagan, 2003]). The analysis of the statis-
tics of the Omori and inverse Omori laws for earthquakes of

magnitude down to 3 (Helmstetter [2003]; Helmstetter and
Sornette [2003a]) suggests that m0 is smaller than the com-
pleteness magnitude md and is thus not directly observable.
Thus, m0 is the size of the smallest triggering earthquake,
which most likely diﬀers signiﬁcantly in size from the cur-
rent detection threshold md. By considering the branching
structure of the model, we derive the apparent branching
ratio and the apparent background source that are found
if only the observed (detected) part of the ETAS model is
analyzed.

As stated above, the ETAS model consists of statistically
independent Poisson-distributed clusters. Within each clus-
ter, each shock has exactly one trigger, apart from the initial
background event (mainshock) that sets oﬀ the cascade. We
restrict this study to the case n < 1 for mathematical conve-
nience and because this range of branching ratios gives rise
to statistically stationary seismic sequences.

Since aftershock clusters are independent of each other,
averages of one cluster are equal to ensemble averages, as
nothing but the inherent stochasticity of the model deter-
mines the properties of the clusters. One cluster consists of
one independent background event (source) and its direct
and indirect aftershocks. However, if not all events of the
sequence are detected, then there will appear to be less di-
rect (and indirect) aftershocks, i.e. the branching ratio will
appear diﬀerent. Furthermore, some observed events will be
triggered by mother-earthquakes below the detection thresh-
old, resulting in apparently independent background events.
We will refer to the observed branching structure above
the detection threshold as the apparent structure. As a
useful visualization of the eﬀect of the detection threshold
on the branching structure, one can think of the branching
structure as a mountain range that is submerged to some
fraction of its height in water (see Figure 1). The height of
each mountain corresponds to the magnitude of an earth-
quake. To the left (i.e. backward in time) of each peak
forward in
is one peak (the trigger) and to the right (i.e.
time) of each peak may be several (the direct aftershocks),
connected from left to right via a ridge linking trigger to
oﬀspring. Since the height of the peaks varies (according to
the GR law), some of the peaks will be below water (below
the detection threshold). A whole part of the branch may
be submerged in water (i.e. unobserved) until eventually a
peak rises above the surface and appears to have no ridge
connecting it to a previous peak, because the ridge of the
last observable mountain simply descends into the water.

This view leads to the conclusion that the average num-
ber of direct aftershocks that are observed will be less than
the real branching ratio, since some of the triggered events
of an observed shock will fall below md and hence not be
included in the count. Only the fraction fobs from equation
(7) above md of the total direct aftershocks ρ(m) will be ob-
served. Moreover, the pdf P (m|m ≥ md) of mother events
conditioned on being larger than md is zero for m < md
and equal to P (m)/fobs for mmax > m ≥ md. We can thus
deﬁne the apparent branching ratio as

na ≡

for the case α 6= b. The special case α = b gives

na =

kb ln(10)(mmax − md)
1 − 10−b(mmax −m0)

.

Using equation (4) and eliminating k, we have na in terms

of n:

na = n

10(b−α)(mmax −md ) − 1
10(b−α)(mmax −m0) − 1 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

when α 6= b, and

na = n

mmax − md
mmax − m0 (cid:17)

,

(cid:16)

when α = b.
According to expression (12), na ≤ n, where the equality
holds for md equal to m0. In principle, equation (12) also
holds for n > 1, but we restrict this study to the stationary
regime n < 1. Figure 2 shows na as a function of n for a
range of values of m0 for the case α = b. The values of
m0 are m0 = md = 3 (solid), m0 = 0 (dashed), m0 = −5
(dotted) and m0 = −10 (dash-dotted). We assumed md = 3
and mmax = 8. Specifying m0 then ﬁxes the linear slope of
the dependence between n and na. Figure 2 demonstrates
that the apparent (measurable) fraction of aftershocks may
signiﬁcantly underestimate the true fraction of aftershocks
even for m0 not very small. For example, m0 = −5 roughly
translates a real branching ratio of n = 0.9 into an appar-
ent branching ratio na = 0.3. Decreasing α below b places
more importance on the triggering from small earthquakes
and therefore strongly ampliﬁes this eﬀect.

In Figure 3, we plot the ratio na/n as a function of the
unknown m0. Again, we assume md = 3, mmax = 8, b = 1,
but now we let α = 0.5 (dash-dotted), α = 0.8 (dashed) and
α = b = 1.0 (solid). As expected, when m0 = md, the ra-
tio is one because there is no unobserved seismicity. As m0
goes to minus inﬁnity, na approaches zero since almost all
seismicity occurs below the threshold. We see clearly that
unobserved seismicity results in a drastic underestimate of
the fraction of aftershocks.

Given an estimate of the magnitude of the smallest trig-
gering earthquake m0 (see Sornette and Werner [2004] and
references therein), one can calculate the true branching ra-
tio from the apparent branching ratio. In fact, Sornette and
Werner [2004] obtained four estimates of m0 as a function of
n by comparing the ETAS model prediction of the number
of observed aftershocks (8) from ﬁts to observed aftershock
sequences and from the empirical B˚ath’s law. Their equa-
tions (10), (13), (16) and (18) are the estimates of m0 as a
function of n and a number of known constants speciﬁc to
the ﬁts to observed aftershock sequences. We can use these
relations of m0 as a function of n to eliminate m0 from equa-
tion (12) to obtain direct estimates of n as a function of the
measurable na. For simplicity, we restrict the use of their
ﬁndings to the case α = b. The estimate resulting from the
ﬁts performed by Helmstetter et al. [2004] yielded

m0 = mmax − (

)

θcθ

(14)

with the values mmax = 8.5, md = 3, θ = 0.1, c = 0.001,
b = 1 and Kf it = 0.008. The study initiated by Felzer et al.
[2002] provided another estimate

where mmax = 8.5, md = 3, θT = 0.08, AT = 0.116
days−θT , b = α = 1, c = 0.014 and M1 = 6.04. Using
the declustering performed by Reasenberg and Jones [1989],
Sornette and Werner [2004] obtained

m0 = mmax −

n

θcθ10−a
b ln(10)

(1 − 10−b(mmax −md ))

(16)

where mmax = 8.5, md = 3, θ = 0.08, a = −1.67, c = 0.05
and b = 1. Finally, using B˚ath’s law, Sornette and Werner
[2004] found

m0 = mmax − (

n
1 − n

)

(1 − 10−b(mmax −md))
b ln(10)

10b(M1 −ma)

(17)

(11)

(12)

(13)

where M1 − ma = 1.2 according to the the law, b = 1,
mmax = 8.5, and md = 3.

Substituting these four estimates of m0 from equations
(14), (15), (16), and (17) into equation (12) for na provides
four estimates of na versus n all in terms of known constants.
These four estimates of n as a function of na can be used
to ﬁnd the correct fraction of aftershocks from the measur-
able apparent fraction of aftershocks. Figure 4 shows these
four estimates with the above constants. As noted above, n
varies linearly with na with a slope determined by m0. The
four estimates of n as a function of na allow for all possible
values of m0. The solid line n = na, corresponding to the
slope 1 when m0 = md, separates the left side of the graph,
where m0 < md, from the right side, where m0 ≥ md, which
can be ruled out based on observed aftershocks from mag-
nitudes 2. Thus, only the region to the left of the diagonal
should be considered.

Figure 4 can be used to ﬁnd the real fraction of after-
shocks from the measured apparent fraction by assuming
one of the four estimates of m0 as a function of n. For ex-
ample, Helmstetter et al. [2004] ﬁnd that 55 percent of all
earthquakes are aftershocks above md = 3. Using their val-
ues to estimate m0 as a function of n, we can determine that
the real fraction of aftershocks is closer to 75 percent. Thus
the size of this eﬀect is signiﬁcant. Furthermore, having de-
termined a point on the line estimating n from na for all
values of m0 ﬁxes the slope of n(na) and therefore m0. Us-
ing their values, we ﬁnd m0 = 1.2. Similar estimates can be
made using the apparent fraction of aftershock values found
by Felzer et al. [2002] and Reasenberg and Jones [1989].

Assuming that current maximum likelihood estimation
methods of the ETAS model parameters, which assume
m0 = md, determine a branching ratio that corresponds
to the present apparent branching ratio, we can similarly
correct these values to ﬁnd the true fraction of aftershocks
using Figure 4. For example, Zhuang et al.
[2004] ﬁnd a
“criticality parameter” of about 45 percent, which we take
as a proxy for na. Figure 4 shows that the true branching
ratio then lies between 0.45 and 0.80, depending on which
estimate (among the four models (14), (15), (16), and (17))
of m0 as a function of n is chosen. These calculations sug-
gest that previous estimates of the fraction of aftershocks
obtained by various declustering methods signiﬁcantly un-
derestimated its value.

In order to derive the number of shocks within one cas-
cade that are not triggered by a mother above the thresh-
old and thus appear as independent background events, we
need to distinguish between the case where the initial (main)

(15)

X - 6

SORNETTE AND WERNER: APPARENT CLUSTERING AND BACKGROUND EVENTS

shock of magnitude M1 is observable (i.e. M1 ≥ md) and
the case where it is undetected (i.e. M1 < md).

If M1 ≥ md, then the initial mainshock produces
ρ(M1)fobs observed direct aftershocks. On average, these
will in turn collectively produce ρ(M1)fobsna observed sec-
ond generation aftershocks. We speciﬁcally do not consider
events above md triggered from below md, which we deal
with below in the deﬁnition of the apparent background
sources. By continuing this “above-water” cascade for all
generations of aftershocks, we can calculate the number of
triggered events that are in direct lineage above the thresh-
old back to the mainshock as the inﬁnite sum of terms of
ρ(M1)fobs multiplied by the apparent branching ratio na to
the power of the generation. If, on the other hand, the initial
mainshock is below md, then no such direct “above-water”
cascade will be seen. Any observed shock will be triggered
by an event below the water. Thus, for the two cases, the
“above-water” sequence is expressed as:

Nabove =

(cid:26)

ρ(M1)fobs

1−na = Nobs

1−n
1−na
0

, M1 ≥ md
, M1 < md

(18)

Furthermore, since in the ETAS model, a small earthquake
may trigger large earthquakes, an event below md may pro-
duce an observed event above md. An inversion method
that reconstructs the entire branching structure of the model
from an earthquake catalog will identify these shocks as
background events. But since in reality these events were
triggered by earthquakes below the detection threshold, we
will refer to them as apparent background events. These
events can of course trigger their own cascades. We thus
deﬁne apparent background source Sa as the number of ob-
served events above md that are apparently not triggered,
i.e. have “mothers” below md. Again, we distinguish be-
tween the cases where the mainshock magnitude is M1 ≥ md
and M1 < md. For the ﬁrst, Sa is given by the total number
of aftershocks below the threshold multiplied by the aver-
age number r of direct aftershocks they trigger above the
threshold. For the second case, we must also include the di-
rect aftershocks of the initial mainshock that are observed:

n for an example aftershock cascade set oﬀ by a magnitude
m = 5 initial shock. We assumed the values mmax = 8.5,
md = 3 and α = b = 1.0. The ﬁgure shows that for one
cascade, i.e. one independent background event, hundreds
of earthquakes appear as apparent background events when
m0 < md.

In Figure 6, we investigate the relative importance of the
apparent background events with respect to the observed
number of aftershocks of one cascade. According to equa-
tion (22)

Sa/Nobs = n − na,

(23)

i.e. a signiﬁcant fraction n − na of events of the actually ob-
served aftershocks are falsely identiﬁed as background events
(since all events are really triggered from a single mainshock
in our example). For md = m0, the ratio is zero, since no
events trigger below the detection threshold. However, as
m0 decreases and more and more events fall below md, the
fraction increases until na goes to zero and the ratio ap-
proaches n. This eﬀect increases with decreasing α. Small
values of α generally place more importance on the cumula-
tive triggering of small earthquakes.

3.3. Consistency check: Nobs as the sum of “above-
water” cascades triggered by the mainshock and by
the apparent background events

To complete the calculations and show consistency of the
results, we now demonstrate that the observed cascades set
oﬀ by the apparent background events, when added to the
original “above-water” cascade, add up to the total observed
number of aftershocks of the whole sequence. Each apparent
source event will trigger its own cascade above the threshold
md with branching ratio na. The total number of events due
to the apparent background events and their cascades above
the threshold is

Nsource = Sa + Sana + San2

a + ... =

Sa
1 − na

.

(24)

Substituting expression (22) and using (8) gives

Sa =

ρ(M1)
1−n (1 − fobs)r
ρ(M1)
1−n (1 − fobs)r + ρ(M1)fobs

(cid:26)

, M1 ≥ md
, M1 < md

(19)

Nsource =

1−na + ρ(M1−m0)fobs

1−na

Nobs

(n−na)
1−na

, M1 ≥ md
, M1 < md

(25)

Now, the number r of observable direct aftershocks above
md averaged over unobserved mothers between m0 and md
is given by the following conditional branching ratio:

r ≡

1 − fobs (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Combining the direct “above-water” cascade (18) with the
apparent source cascades (25) gives the total amount of ap-
parent events observed after the initial event

, M1 < md

(26)

where we have used P (m|m < md) = P (m)/(1 − fobs) for
m < md and zero otherwise. Substituting (21) into the ex-
pression for the apparent source (19) and re-arranging using
(8), we obtain

Sa =

ρ(M1)
1−n fobs(n − na)
ρ(M1)

, M1 ≥ md
, M1 < md

=

Nobs(n − na)
Nobs(n − na) + ρ(M1)fobs

, M1 ≥ md
, M1 < md

(22)

(cid:26)

(cid:26)

Equation (22) shows that, for each genuine background
event, a perfect inversion method would count Sa apparent
background events. Figure 5 plots the number of apparent
background events Sa as a function of the branching ratio

where Nobs is given by (8). The last equality conﬁrms the
consistency of our decomposition into apparently-triggered
earthquakes and apparent sources.

Expressions (10) and (22) show that analyzing the tree
structure of triggered seismicity only above the detection
threshold leads to the introduction of an apparent source Sa
and an apparent branching ratio na. It is important to real-
ize that both are renormalized simultaneously by md 6= m0.
If the current inversion techniques for the ETAS parameters
were perfect and correctly reconstructed the tree structure of
all sequences, the inverted values would be equal to our an-
alytical results (10) and (22). Accordingly, the value of the
background source would be overestimated and the branch-
ing ratio underestimated. In fact, one single true sequence
will appear as many diﬀerent sequences, each apparently set
oﬀ by an apparent background event.

4. Conclusions

We have shown that unbiased estimates of the fraction
of aftershocks and the number of independent background
events are simultaneously renormalized to apparent values
when the smallest triggering earthquake m0 is smaller than
the detection threshold md. In summary, mainshocks above
the threshold will appear to have less aftershocks, resulting
in a smaller apparent branching ratio. Meanwhile, unob-
served events can trigger events above the threshold giv-
ing rise to apparently independent background events that
seem to increase the constant background rate to an ap-
parent rate. Assuming that current techniques which are
used to invert for the parameters of the ETAS model (for
example, the maximum likelihood method) under the as-
sumption md = m0 are unbiased estimators of na and Sa,
then the obtained values for the fraction of aftershocks and
the background source rate correspond to renormalized val-
ues because of the assumption that the detection threshold
md equals the smallest triggering earthquake m0. We pre-
dict that n will be drastically underestimated and S strongly
overestimated for m0 much smaller than md.

Figure 2. The apparent fraction of aftershocks (ap-

fraction of aftershocks (real branching ratio) n with a
slope ﬁxed by the smallest triggering earthquake m0. As
m0 decreases, the apparent fraction of aftershocks signiﬁ-
cantly underestimates the real fraction. As examples, we
chose m0 = md = 3 (solid), i.e. na = n and no events
are missed; m0 = 0 (dashed); m0 = −5 (dotted); and
m0 = −10 (dash-dotted). We further assumed parame-
ters md = 3, mmax = 8, b = 1, and α = 1.0. A small
value of α ampliﬁes this eﬀect (see Figure 3).

Figure 4. The fraction of aftershocks (branching ra-
tio) n can be estimated from the apparent fraction of
aftershocks (apparent branching ratio) na by using four
estimates of the smallest triggering earthquake m0 as
a function of n as determined in Sornette and Werner
[2004] (see text). The estimates of m0 as a function of n
were obtained from comparisons of the ETAS model pre-
diction of the number of observed aftershocks and ﬁts to
observed aftershock sequences performed by Helmstetter
et al.
[2002] (dash-dotted),
Reasenberg and Jones [1989] (dotted) and from B˚ath’s
law (dashed). The additional diagonal solid line na = n
corresponds to m0 = md (no undetected events). Along
any of the four lines, m0 varies from minus inﬁnity to
mmax. Given that we can rule out m0 ≥ md, we can
restrict the physical range to the left side of the refer-
ence curve na = n. Given an estimate of the apparent
(measured) fraction of aftershocks na, we can estimate
the real fraction from one of the four lines. Because n is
linearly proportional to na, an estimate of na not only
determines n from one of the curves, but also estimates
m0 from the slope of the line connecting the point (na, n)
to the origin. For example, the estimate of Helmstetter et
al. [2004] of 55 percent of observed aftershocks approx-
imately gives a real fraction n of 75 percent according
to their own ﬁts to aftershocks and thereby determines
m0 = 1.2 for mmax = 8 and md = 3.

Figure 5. The number of apparent background events
Sa in an aftershock cascade due to a single background
event of magnitude M1 = 5 as a function of the frac-
tion of aftershocks (branching ratio) n for several values
of the smallest triggering earthquake. For m0 = md,
no events are missed. Therefore the number of appar-
ent background events is zero. As m0 decreases, events
below the detection threshold trigger events above the
threshold and hence the number of apparent background
events increases. We vary m0 = md = 3 (solid, coinciding
with x-axis), m0 = 0 (dash-dotted), m0 = −5 (dashed),
and m0 = −10 (upper solid curve). We used parame-
ters md = 3, mmax = 8, b = 1, and α = 1.0. For very
small m0 and n close to 1, almost all events above the
detection threshold are triggered from below and thus Sa
becomes very large (see Figure 6). This eﬀect is ampliﬁed
for decreasing α (not shown).

(dash-dotted) as a function of the branching ratio n (av-
erage number of aftershocks per earthquake also equal
to the fraction of aftershocks in a catalog) for parame-
ters md = 3, mmax = 8, b = 1, and α = 1.0. For very
small m0, na approaches zero and the ratio Sa/Nobs ap-
proaches its limiting value n, meaning that almost all
observed earthquakes were triggered by events below the
detection threshold md. The eﬀect of unobserved events
triggering observed quakes resulting in an apparent back-
ground source rate is further ampliﬁed by smaller values
of α (not shown).

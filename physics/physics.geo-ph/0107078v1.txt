In paper I [Tsiklauri & Beresnev, Phys. Rev. E 63, 046304 (2001)] we analyzed resonance eﬀects
in the dynamics of a Maxwell ﬂuid ﬂowing through a longitudinally vibrating tube and subject to
oscillatory pressure gradient. We calculated the function F (κ) that measures the deviation from
Poisseuille ﬂow friction as a function of frequency parameter κ. The present study investigates nov-
elties brought about into the classic Biot’s theory of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated
porous solid by inclusion of non-Newtonian eﬀects that are important, for example, for hydrocar-
bons. Namely, using our previous results, we have investigated the propagation of rotational and
dilatational elastic waves, through calculating their phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients as a
function of frequency. This study has clearly shown the transition from dissipative to non-Newtonian
regime in which sharp enhancements (resonances) of the above mentioned physical quantities are
found.

I. INTRODUCTION

Apart from fundamental interest, there are at least three major reasons to study the dynamics of ﬂuid in porous
media under oscillatory pressure gradient and oscillating pore walls, as well as to investigate propagation of elastic
waves in porous media.

First, in petroleum geophysics, regional exploration seismology needs direct methods of discovering oil-ﬁlled bodies
of rock, and these should be based on models of propagation of elastic waves in porous media with realistic ﬂuid
rheologies [1].

Second, the investigation of the dynamics of ﬂuid in porous media under oscillatory pressure gradient and oscillating
pore walls is of prime importance for the recently emerged technology of acoustic stimulation of oil reservoirs [2]. It
is known that the natural pressure in an oil reservoir generally yields no more than approximately 10 percent oil
recovery. The residual oil is diﬃcult to produce due to its naturally low mobility, and the enhanced oil recovery
operations are used to increase production. It has been experimentally proven that there is a substantial increase in
the net ﬂuid ﬂow through porous space if the latter is treated with elastic waves [2].

Third, in the environment conservation, treatment of ground water aquifers contaminated by organic liquids, such
as hydrocarbons, by elastic waves proved to be successful for quick and eﬃcient clean up [2]. However, there is a
fundamental lack of understanding of the physical mechanisms of ﬂuid mobilization in saturated rock through the
eﬀect of elastic waves; the theory of such mobilization virtually does not exist.

A quantitative theory of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid was formulated in the classic
papers by Biot [3]. One of the major ﬁndings of Biot’s work was that there is a breakdown in Poisseuille ﬂow
above a certain characteristic frequency speciﬁc to the ﬂuid-saturated porous material. Biot theoretically studied this
phenomenon by considering the ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid in a tube with longitudinally oscillating walls under an oscillatory
pressure gradient. In Biot’s theory, the two-phase material is considered as a continuum and the microscopic, pore-
level eﬀects are ignored. As a reminder, the theory assumes that: (a) the wavelength is large with respect to the
dimensions of pores in order to make continuum mechanics applicable; this also implies that scaterring dissipation is
negligible; (b) the displacements are small, therefore the macroscopic strain tensor is related to them by the lowest
second-order approximation; (c) the liquid phase is continuous, such that the pores are connected and isolated pores
are treated as part of solid matrix; and (d) the permeability is isotropic and the medium is fully saturated.

Biot demonstrated the existence of the two kinds of compressional waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous medium: the
fast wave for which the solid and ﬂuid displacements are in phase, and the slow wave for which the displacements are
out of phase. At low frequencies, the medium does not support the slow wave as it becomes diﬀusive. On the other
hand, at high frequencies, tangential slip takes place, inertial eﬀects dominate, and the slow wave becomes activated.
Biot’s theory can be used to describe interaction of ﬂuid-saturated solid with the sound for a classic Newtonian
ﬂuid; however, oil and other hydrocarbons often exhibit signiﬁcant non-Newtonian behavior [4]. In paper I (Ref. [5]),
we have incorporated non-Newtonian eﬀects into the classical theory of Biot [3]. Using the recent results of del Rio,

1

de Haro and Whitaker [6], who presented a study of enhancement in the dynamic response of a viscoelastic (Maxwell)
ﬂuid ﬂowing through a stationary (non-oscillating) tube under the eﬀect of an oscillatory pressure gradient, we have
combined their theory with the eﬀect of the acoustic oscillations of the walls of the tube introduced by Biot [3],
thus providing a complete description of the interaction of Maxwell ﬂuid, ﬁlling the pores, with acoustic waves. We
have generalized the expression for the the function F (κ), which measures the deviation from Poisseuille ﬂow friction
as a function of frequency parameter κ [5]. As a next step, in the present work we investigate the propagation of
rotational and dilatational elastic waves through the porous medium ﬁlled with Maxwell ﬂuid, by calculating their
phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients as a function of frequency. Also, this study, similarly to the results of
Paper I, has clearly shown the transition from dissipative to non-Newtonian regime in which sharp enhancements
(resonances) of the above mentioned physical quantities are found.

This paper is organized as follows: we formulate theoretical basis for our numerical calculations in section II. In
sections III and IV we study numerically properties of the rotational and dilatational elastic waves, respectively, and,
ﬁnally, in Section V we close with a discussion of our main results.

II. THEORY

The theory of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid was formulated by Biot [3]. He demon-
strated that the general equations which govern propagation of rotational and dilatational high-frequency waves in a
ﬂuid-saturated porous medium are the same as in the low-frequency range provided the viscosity is replaced by its
eﬀective value as a function of frequency. In practice, it means replacing the resistance coeﬃcient b by bF (κ).

The equations describing dynamics of the rotational waves are [3]

the solid is represented by the modulus N . Substitution of a plane rotational wave of the form

classical result obtained by Biot (see details in Paper I).

As noted in Ref.

[6], the value of the parameter α determines in which regime the system resides. Beyond a
certain critical value (αc = 11.64), the system is dissipative, and viscous eﬀects dominate. On the other hand, for
small α (α < αc), the system exhibits viscoelastic behavior which we call the non-Newtonian regime. Note, that the
Newtonian ﬂow regime can be easily recovered from Eq.(15) by putting α

In order to investigate the novelties brought about into classical Biot’s theory of propagation of elastic waves in
porous medium [3] by the inclusion of non-Newtonian eﬀects, we have studied the full parameter space of the problem.
We have calculated the normalized phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients for both rotational and dilatational
waves using our general expression for F (κ) given by Eq. (15).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR PROPAGATION OF ROTATIONAL WAVES

In all our numerical calculations, we have used polynomial expansions of J0 and J1 with absolute error not exceeding
10−6 %. Thus, our calculation results are accurate to this order. Also, in order to catch a true oscillatory structure
of our solutions (see below), number of data points in all our plots is 10000, as opposed to paper I where only 100
points per curve were taken.

In all forthcoming results, we calculate phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients for the case 1 from Table I
[3], which is σ11 = 0.610, σ22 = 0.305, σ12 = 0.043, γ11 = 0.500, γ22 = 0.500, γ12 = 0, z1 = 0.812,

taken from Ref.
and z2 = 1.674.

We calculated normalized phase velocity of the plane rotational waves, vr/Vr, and the attenuation coeﬃcient Lr/xa

using our more general expression for F (κ) (Maxwell ﬂuid ﬁlling the pores) given by Eq. (15).

In Fig. 1 we plot phase velocity vr/Vr as a function of frequency for the two cases: the thick curve corresponds
(Newtonian limit), while the thin curve corresponds to a slightly sub-critical value of α = 10 (recall that
to α
αc = 11.64). Note that the α
case perfectly reproduces the curve 1 in Fig. 5 from Ref. [3]. For α = 10 we notice
a deviation from the classic Newtonian behavior in the form of overall increase of phase velocity and appearance of
small oscillations on the curve, which means that we have entered the non-Newtonian regime.

→ ∞

In Fig. 2 we draw phase velocity vr/Vr as a function of frequency for the case of α = 1. Note that the phase
velocity settles at somewhat higher value and this onset happens already for smaller frequencies than in the case of
Newtonian ﬂuid. Also, much more pronounced oscillatory structure of the solution can be noticed.

In Fig. 3 we plot phase velocity vr/Vr as a function of frequency for the case of α = 10−3, which corresponds to a
deeply non-Newtonian regime. We notice a highly oscillatory structure of the solution and the appearance of sharp
resonances where phase velocity of the rotational waves increases up to a factor of 30 with respect to a Newtonian
ﬂuid case.

Fig. 4 shows the attenuation coeﬃcient Lr/xa of the rotational wave as a function of frequency for the two values
of α: the thick curve corresponds to α
(Newtonian limit), while the thin curve corresponds to a slightly sub-
case coincides with curve 1 in Fig. 6 from Ref. [3]. For α = 10, there is a
critical value of α = 10. Note that α

Fig. 5 presents the attenuation coeﬃcient Lr/xa as a function of frequency for the case of α = 1. Note again that
the attenuation coeﬃcient settles at a somewhat lower value, and this happens already for smaller frequencies than
in the case of Newtonian ﬂuid. Also, much more pronounced oscillatory structure of the solution can be noticed.

Fig. 6 presents the attenuation coeﬃcient as a function of frequency for the case of α = 10−3. Again, we notice a
highly oscillatory structure of the solution and appearance of sharp resonances. An overall decrease of Lr/xa can be
noticed too.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR PROPAGATION OF DILATATIONAL WAVES

We calculated normalized phase velocities of the plane dilatational waves, vI /Vc and vII /Vc, and the attenuation
coeﬃcients Lc/xI and Lc/xII using our more general expression for F (κ) (Maxwell ﬂuid ﬁlling the pores) given by
Eq. (15).

In Fig. 7 we plot phase velocity vI /Vc as a function of frequency for the case of α

, in order to recover the

Newtonian limit obtained by Biot. Note that this case reproduces curve 1 in Fig. 11 from Ref. [3].

Fig. 8 shows phase velocity vI /Vc as a function of frequency for the case of α = 10−3, corresponding to the
deeply non-Newtonian regime. We notice a highly oscillatory structure of the solution and the appearance of sharp

resonances, where the phase velocity of the rotational waves increases by a factor of up to 60 with respect to the
Newtonian-ﬂuid case.

In Fig. 9 we plot phase velocity vII /Vc as a function of frequency for the case of α

. This is also done in order
to recover the Newtonian limit obtained by Biot. Note that this case coincides with curve 1 in Fig. 12 from Ref. [3].
Fig. 10 presents the phase velocity vII /Vc as a function of frequency for the case of α = 10−3, which corresponds to
the deeply non-Newtonian regime. Again, we notice a highly oscillatory structure of the solution and the appearance
of sharp dips.

low frequencies is also due to non-Newtonian eﬀects.

Fig. 12 shows the attenuation coeﬃcient Lc/xI as a function of frequency for the case of α = 1. Note that the

case of a Newtonian ﬂuid. Also, a much more pronounced oscillatory structure of the solution can be noticed.

Fig. 13 presents the attenuation coeﬃcient Lc/xI as a function of frequency for the case of α = 10−3, which
corresponds to the deeply non-Newtonian regime. We notice a highly oscillatory structure of the solution and the
appearance of sharp resonances. We also notice an overall decrease in Lc/xI in comparison to the Newtonian case.

In Fig. 14 we plot the attenuation coeﬃcient Lc/xII as a function of frequency for the two cases: the thick curve

In Fig. 15 we plot the attenuation coeﬃcient Lc/xII as a function of frequency for the case of α = 1. Note that the
attenuation coeﬃcient settles again at somewhat lower value and this happens already for smaller frequencies than in
the case of the Newtonian ﬂuid. Also, much more pronounced oscillatory structure of the solution can be noticed.

In Fig. 16 we plot the attenuation coeﬃcient Lc/xII as a function of frequency for the case of α = 10−3. We notice
highly oscillatory structure of the solution and the appearance of sharp resonances. An overall decrease in Lc/xII
can be noticed again.

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have studied the non-Newtonian eﬀects in the propagation of elastic waves in porous media
by calculating phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients of the rotational and dilatational waves as a function of
frequency. Originally, Biot [3] performed similar analysis for a Newtonian ﬂuid-saturated porous medium. Using
our recent results [Paper I], and motivated by a current need in models of propagation of elastic waves in porous
media with realistic ﬂuid rheologies, we have generalized the work of Biot to the case of a non-Newtonian (Maxwell)
ﬂuid-saturated porous medium.

In summary, we found that replacement of an ordinary Newtonian ﬂuid by a Maxwell ﬂuid in the ﬂuid-saturated

porous medium results in

The investigation of properties of elastic waves is important for a number of applications. The knowledge of phase
velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients of elastic waves in a realistic [such as saturated with Maxwell ﬂuid] porous
medium is necessary, for example, to guide the oil-ﬁeld exploration applications, acoustic stimulation of oil producing
ﬁelds (in order to increase the amount of recovered residual oil), and the acoustic clean up of contamined aquifers [2].
The idea of the paper was to use the function, F (κ), that measures the deviation from Poiseuille ﬂow friction,
extended to Maxwell ﬂuids, and to substitute it into Biot’s equations of poroelasticity without changing the latter.

5

However, Biot’s equations have been derived under a number of assumptions. One of these assumptions is that
deviatoric (shear) components of the macroscopic stress in the ﬂuid are negligible [7]. Pride at al.
[7] showed that
G, where η is the dynamic viscosity of the ﬂuid, ω is frequency, and G is
this assumption is justiﬁed when ηω
frame shear modulus. Simple analysis shows that for typical Newtionian ﬂuids such as water, this condition is only
violated at frequencies ω > 109 1/s, or f = ω/(2π) > 108 Hz. Thus, for all frequencies below 1 MHz Biot’s assumption
is justiﬁed. However, when we introduce the Maxwell ﬂuid, the situation changes in that we introduce the real (in
addition to imaginary) shear stresses. In summary, for any rheology (including Maxwellian) Biot’s theory is only
valid if macroscopic shear stresses are negligible. In order to prove that, we note from the rheological equation for a
Maxwell ﬂuid

where ˜τ represents the viscous stress tensor, that in the frequency domain we can eﬀectively obtain

1/tm, then the ﬂuid is eﬀectively Newtonian and Biot’s theory is valid. When ω

This means that we can roughly replace η in all our estimates with η′/(1 + itmω). There are two limiting cases. When
ω
1/tm, i.e. when the ﬂuid is
essentially non-Newtonian, we eﬀectively have η′ = η/(itmω), which in this case is smaller than η in absolute value.
Thus, when substituted into the shear stress, S, it produces S = iη′ω = η/tm, which is smaller than ηω. Therefore,
we conclude that inequality η′ω
G still holds for the Maxwellian ﬂuid, i.e. Biot’s equations are valid for Maxwell
rheology.

Finally, we would like to comment on the unexpected strong oscillations of phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃ-
cients that were obtained by our numerical analysis. The results are based on equation (15), which has been derived
for a circular cylindrical geometry. This is the same geometry that was used in classical works of Biot and others.
For Newtonian ﬂuids the use of such an idealized geometry for porous materials was backed up by an analysis that
showed that the results are not very sensitive to the particular geometry (see, e.g., Ref.[8]). Of course, the magnitude
of these oscillations depends on ﬂuid parameters and permeability, and may not be as high for many ﬂuids. However,
even if parameters are such that oscillations are large, it is unclear at this stage whether this oscillatory behavior
will hold for more realistic geometry, i.e. when curved pore walls (tortuosity) are considered. There is a possibility
that with tortuosity eﬀects included the obtained oscillations will be smeared. However, our goal was to constrain
ourselves with simple cylindrical geometry, and a separate study is needed to analyse the tortuosity eﬀects on our
results.

Numerical simulation of lava ﬂows based on depth-averaged equations
Antonio Costa and Giovanni Macedonio
Osservatorio Vesuviano, Istituto Nazionale di Geoﬁsica e Vulcanologia, Napoli, Italy

Risks and damages associated with lava ﬂows propagation (for
instance the most recent Etna eruptions) require a quantitative de-
scription of this phenomenon and a reliable forecasting of lava ﬂow
paths. Due to the high complexity of these processes, numerical
solution of the complete conservation equations for real lava ﬂows
is often practically impossible. To overcome the computational
difﬁculties, simpliﬁed models are usually adopted, including 1-D
models and cellular automata. In this work we propose a simpliﬁed
2D model based on the conservation equations for lava thickness
and depth-averaged velocities and temperature which result in ﬁrst
order partial differential equations. The proposed approach repre-
sents a good compromise between the full 3-D description and the
need to decrease the computational time. The method was satisfac-
torily applied to reproduce some analytical solutions and to simulate
a real lava ﬂow event occurred during the 1991-93 Etna eruption.

1. Introduction

Depth averaged ﬂow models based on the so-called shallow wa-
ter equations (SWE) were ﬁrstly introduced by De Saint Venant in
1864 and Boussinesq in 1872. Nowdays, applications of the shal-
low water equations include a wide range of problems which have
important implications for hazard assessment, from ﬂood simula-
tion [Burguete et al., 2002] to tsunamis propagation [Heinrich et al.,
2001].
In this paper we propose a generalized set of depth averaged equa-
tions, including an energy equation, to describe lava ﬂow propaga-
tion. We considered lava ﬂow as channelized, i.e. moving lava has
a non-continuous roof and the top represents a free surface open to
the atmosphere.

2. Model description

∗ /L2

The model is based on depth-averaged equations obtained by
integrating mass, momentum and energy equations over the ﬂuid
depth, from the bottom up to the free surface. This approach is
valid in the limit H 2
∗ ≪ 1 (where H∗ is the undisturbed ﬂuid
height and L∗ the characteristic wave length scale in the ﬂow direc-
tion). This means that we are dealing with very long waves or with
“shallow water”.
Assuming an incompressible homogeneous ﬂuid and a hydrostatic
pressure distribution, the shallow water equations for an uniform or
gradually varied ﬂow are given by:

H
averaged ﬂuid velocity components, βij are correction factors (in
the range 0.5-1.5) and γ is a dimensionless friction coefﬁcient de-
pending on the ﬂuid rheology and on the properties of both ﬂow and
bed. The gradients ∂H/∂xi indicate the channel bottom slopes in
both directions x and y (xi = x, y). The terms on the right sides
represent the so-called source terms.
In the case of lava, the viscosity is strongly temperature dependent.
For this reason, besides the equations (1), (2) and (3), it is necessary
to solve the equation for the energy conservation. From a com-
putational point of view, the temperature equation is similar to the
pollutant transport equation [Monthe et al., 1999; LeVeque, 2002].
We propose the following heuristic equation for the depth-averaged

where Tc and Tenv are the temperatures of the lava-ground inter-
face and of the external environment respectively, and βT i, E , W,
H and K are a set of semi-empirical parameters. Terms on the
right side of the equation (4) represent the radiative, convective and
conductive exchanges respectively, while the last term is due to the
viscous heating. Moreover, a simple exponential relationship be-
tween magma viscosity and temperature was assumed [Costa and
Macedonio, 2002]:

µ = µr exp [−b(T − Tr)]

(5)

where b is an appropriate rheological parameter and µr is the viscos-
ity value at the reference temperature Tr (for instance, Tr = T0 with
T0 equal to the emission temperature at the vent). For the descrip-
tion of a thermal balance in lava ﬂows, similar to the equation (4)
see Keszthely and Self [1998]. We do not explicitly accounted
for crystallization and crystallinity-dependence of the viscosity, but
they are implicitly considered in the determination of the rheologi-
cal parameters in (5). Concerning the coefﬁcient γ which appears
in the equations (2) and (3), we propose a relationship similar to
that used in the viscous regime [Gerbeau and Perthame, 2001; Fer-
rari and Saleri, 2004]: γ = κ∗/[1 + κ∗h/(3νr)], where κ∗ is the
Navier friction coefﬁcient, νr = µr/ρ and ρ = ﬂuid density. This
relationship permits in principle to consider different and general
wall friction conditions and, for instance, the possibility to include
viscous heating effects on lava ﬂow velocity [Costa and Macedo-
nio, 2003] by choosing the appropriate κ∗ parameterization. By
considering the viscosity dependence on temperature(5) and, for
simplicity, the limit κ∗h/(3νr) ≫ 1, we obtain:

γ =

exp [−b(T − Tr)]

the term κ R

H

H ≈ nκ/h

(7)

where κ = k/(ρcp) is the thermal diffusivity (k is the thermal con-
ductivity and cp the speciﬁc heat) and we approximated the char-
acteristic thermal boundary layer length as a fraction of the total
thickness: δT ≈ h/n where n depends on the temperature proﬁle
(n ∼ 4 ÷ pν/κ).
According to Pieri and Baloga [1986]’s study, for the radiative term,
we assumed:

E ≈ ǫσf /(ρcp)

(8)

where ǫ is the emissivity, σ the Stephan-Boltzmann constant (σ =
−8Wm−2K−4) and f is the fractional area of the exposed
5.67 · 10
inner core [Crisp and Baloga, 1990]. For simplicity, in this version
of the model we assumed f as a constant. In real lava ﬂows f may
change with time and space f = f (x, t) and, in principle, it can
be estimated from ﬁeld measurements or remote sensing. Further
studies should investigate the sensivity of the model with the tem-
poral and spatial changes of this quantity.
For the convective term, we adopted [Keszthely and Self , 1998]:

W ≈ λf /(ρcp)

(9)

where λ is the atmospheric heat transfer coefﬁcient.
Finally, for the viscous heating term, we approximate the order of
µ(∂v/∂z)2dz as
magnitude of the quantity Φ = 1/(ρcp) R
−b(T −Tr )(U 2 + V 2)m/h, where we approximated the charac-
µre
teristic velocity boundary layer as δv ≈ h/m; hence:

H+h

H

K ≈ mµr/(ρcph)

(10)

where in the case of a parabolic velocity proﬁle m = 12 [Shah and
Pearson, 1974].
By using the approximations and parameterizations described
above, we obtain the ﬁnal system of equations we solve by means
of the numerical method described in the Section 3.

3. The numerical method

The numerical

(3)
and (4), was achieved by using an algorithm based on
the software package CLAWPACK (available on the web
at http://www.amath.washington.edu/˜rlj/claw-
pack.html). CLAWPACK is a public domain software package
designed to compute numerical solutions to hyperbolic partial dif-
ferential equations using a wave propagation approach [LeVeque,
2002].
The CLAWPACK routines were generalized in order to treat the
viscous friction source term and to solve the energy equation (4).
The modelling of lava ﬂow over an initially dry downstream region
(dry bed problem) was approached following the method described
in Monthe et al. [1999]. All the source terms in the governing equa-
tions were treated using a Godunov splitting method and, since as
a simple explicit discretization leads to numerical instabilities [e.g.
Ambrosi, 1999; Monthe et al., 1999], all terms were discretized us-
ing a semi-implicit scheme. For instance, the source term in the
equation (2) was discretized as below:

qn+1 − qn
∆t

= −ghn

∂H
∂x

− 3νrqn+1

e

−b(Tn −Tr )

where pedice n indicates the quantities at the time tn, and qn =
Unhn. The other source terms were discretized by using a similar
approach.

Before the application, the algorithm was tested by simulating
some cases for which analytical solutions are known. In fact, con-
sidering the ﬂow of a quasi-unconﬁned layer of viscous liquid on

considering the same parameters reported in Figure 2.

Simulation results have shown a good agreement with an error less
than 1% for the conservative variables h, hV and hT and, within
a few % for the non-conservative variable V and T . Moreover, in
order to estimate the importance of each term on the right side of the
equation (4), we considered the same geometry of the simple slope
ﬂow as above and the typical values reported in the caption of the
Figure 2. Results, plotted in the Figure 2, show that radiative cooling
is the main heat loss mechanism, while conductive and atmospheric
convective cooling is less important but, for the parameter values
used here, conductive loss is comparable with convection cooling.
Viscous heating effect can be neglected in terms of mean lava tem-
perature (in the simulated case it produces a increase of a few oC
for a distance of 1 km), although, in certain conditions, it could
be more important and determinant in the choosing the appropriate
wall conditions and exchange coefﬁcients for both momentum and
energy [Costa and Macedonio, 2003]. About effects of the coupling
between momentum and energy equations, we can see a non-zero b
is important to determine the longitudinal variation of the lava ﬂow
thickness (see Figure 3), although it increases slightly the cooling
beyond certain distances. Figure 3 shows as the velocity decrease
due to the longitudinal viscosity increase is able to cause a longitu-
dinal rise of the lava thickness because of the viscosity temperature
dependence.

4. Application to Etna lava ﬂows

Figure 4. Simulated lava thickness of the 3rd and 4th January
Etna lava ﬂow.

In this section, as an application, we reported simulation results
of the initial phases of the 1991-1993 Etna eruption for which some
ﬁeld data for input and comparison are available [Calvari et al.,
1994]. In particular we simulated the second phase occurred from
the 3rd up to the 10th January 1992. In order to estimate previously
introduced semi-empirical parameters, we considered the typical
magma parameters reported in Table 1 partially derived from data
of Calvari et al. [1994]. We assumed as representative an effec-
tive viscosity of 103 Pa·s at an estimated vent temperature of about
1353 K and b ≈ 0.02 K−1 that, for a cooling of about 100 K, re-
produces the observed viscosities of the order of 104 Pa·s [Calvari
et al., 1994]. Other parameters were chosen within typical ranges:
f = 0.1 (between 0.01 and 1 [Keszthely and Self , 1998]), and
ǫ = 0.8 (between 0.6 and 0.9 [Neri, 1998]). Tc is set higher than
its typical values since, for numerical reasons, we need to limit the
maximum viscosity value.
The parameters reported in Table 1 give the following typical values:

H ∼ 3/h × 10
E ≈ 1.5 × 10
W ≈ 2 × 10
K ∼ 4h × 10

−15 m s−1K−3

where, for our aim in this application, we set Tenv = 300 K, n = 4,
m = 12 and βij = 1.

As topographic basis, we used the digital data ﬁles of the Etna
maps with a 1:10000 scale available at the Osservatorio Vesuviano-
INGV web site at http://venus.ov.ingv.it (the used spa-
tial grid resolution was ∆x = ∆y = 25 m). For the second phase,
we considered an ephemeral vent sited in Piano del Trifoglietto at
the UTM coordinates (503795; 4174843). Finally, for the period
3-10 January 1992, we considered a constant average lava ﬂow rate
of 16 m3/s (ranging from 8 to 25 m3/s) [Calvari et al., 1994; Barberi
et al., 1993].
The ﬁrst phase of the eruption corresponded with the initial spread-
ing of the lava ﬂows on Piano del Trifoglietto. On the 3rd January
1992 a new lava ﬂow that overlapped the older lava lows, became
an independent branch. By the evening it covered more than 1 km.
The day after the front reached Mt. Calanna. One branch continued
to move to the south of Mt. Calanna and one branch turned to the
north then to the east (see Figure 3 of Calvari et al. [1994]). Be-
cause of a signiﬁcantly decrease of lava supply, the southern lava
ﬂow stopped in Val Calanna. On January 7th the northern lava lobe
touched the southern one and then merged [Calvari et al., 1994].
In Figure 4 the simulated lava ﬂow at the end of the second phase
is shown. The model is able to reproduce semi-quantitatively the
behaviour of the real lava ﬂow and the order of magnitude of the
quantities involved such as thickness, temperature and the time of
front propagation of the lava ﬂow. Although we introduced different
simpliﬁcations and we considered an arduous case encompassing
both a large viscous friction term and complex rough topography,
the simulation and real lava ﬂows show strikingly similar dynamics
and thermal pattern evolution. Nevertheless the model presented

in this paper remains an initial model of lava ﬂow emplacement
using SWE. Future improvements are expected by reﬁning the the
computational performance of the model and the formulation of the
parameters.

5. Limitations

∗ /L2

This methodology is based on vertical averages and therefore it
cannot be rigorously valid for every conceivable application. We
stress that the model is based on the basic assumptions of (1) small
vertical scale relative to horizontal (H 2
∗ ≪ 1), (2) homogeneous
incompressible ﬂuid, (3) hydrostatic pressure distribution, (4) slow
vertical variations.
Concerning the computational method, the principal limit is related
to the numerical treatment we used here for the source terms arising
from topography and viscous friction. In particular since the ac-
tual topographies may contain abrupt variations, the slope term that
appears in the equations (2) and (3) can become inﬁnite in correspon-
dence of discontinuities leading to numerical oscillations, diffusion,
smearing and non-physical solutions [LeVeque, 1998; Alcrudo and
Benkhaldoun, 2001; Chinnayya et al., 2004]. Also the friction term
must be carefully treated. In fact, if the characteristic time of the
source term is much smaller than the characteristic time of the con-
vective part of the equations, the problem is said to be stiff and the
classical splitting method may provide erroneous physical solutions
on coarse meshes [Chinnayya et al., 2004]. To avoid these problems
a trivial solution is using a very small time step, which results in
long computational times. In the next version of the model, this
limit could be overcome by applying directly a method based on the
solution of the inhomogeneous Riemann problem with source term
instead of applying the splitting method [Chinnayya et al., 2004;
George, 2004].

6. Conclusion

A new general computational model for lava ﬂow propagation
based on the solution of depth-averaged equations for mass, momen-
tum and energy equation was described. This approach appears to
be a robust physical description and a good compromise between
the full 3-D simulation and the necessity to decrease the compu-
tational time. The model was satisfactorily applied to reproduce
some analytical solutions and to simulate a real lava ﬂow event oc-
curred during the 1991-93 Etna eruption. The good performance
obtained in this preliminary version of the model makes this ap-
proach a potential tool to forecast reliably lava ﬂow paths to use for
risk mitigation, although the used algorithm should be improved for
a better treatment of the source terms.

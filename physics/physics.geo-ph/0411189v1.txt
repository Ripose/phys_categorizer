Abstract

In this paper we try to suggest a possible novel method to deter-
mine some selected even zonal harmonics Jℓ of the Earth’s geopotential.
Time series many years long of suitably linearly combined residuals of
some Keplerian orbital elements of certain existing geodetic SLR satel-
lites would be examined. A CHAMP/GRACE-only background refer-
ence model should be used for the part of the geopotential which we are
not interested in. The retrieved values for the even zonal harmonics of
interest would be, by construction, independent of each other and of
any post-Newtonian features. The so obtained mini-model could, sub-
sequently, be used in order to enhance the accuracy and the reliability
of some tests of post-Newtonian gravity, with particular emphasis to
the measurement of the Lense-Thirring eﬀect by means of LAGEOS
and LAGEOS II.

Keywords: Even zonal harmonics, LAGEOS and Ajisai satellites, New Earth
gravity models.

Introduction

The long and accurate available records of data from the laser-ranged geode-
tic satellites of LAGEOS type have proven to be an excellent and unique
tool for investigating the long-term variations of the terrestrial gravity ﬁeld
induced by mass redistribution in the Earth system by means of the Satellite
Laser Ranging (SLR) technique.

In particular, the secular variations ˙Jℓ of the even zonal harmonic coeﬃ-
cients Jℓ of the Newtonian multipolar expansion of the Earth’s gravitational
potential have recently received many attention from the geodesists’ com-
munity (Cheng et al. 1997; Bianco et al. 1998; Cox and Chao 2002, Cox et
al. 2003), mainly due to the observed inversion of the rate of change of the

1

Earth’s quadrupole mass moment coeﬃcient J2 which, since 1998, began
increasing (Cox and Chao 2002).
It is not yet clear if such an eﬀect is a
long-term feature or is short-term in nature.

An accurate knowledge of the secular variations of the other low-degree
even zonal harmonics, with particular emphasis on ˙J4 and ˙J6, is of the
utmost importance also for a reliable and consistent evaluation of the total
accuracy in the tests aimed at the detection of the post-Newtonian general
relativistic Lense–Thirring eﬀect1 (Ciufolini and Pavlis 2004; Iorio 2004a;
2004b). At present, there is a large uncertainty about the magnitude and
even the sign of

˙J4 and J6; see, e.g., Table 1 of (Cox et al. 2003).
In this paper we propose a new strategy in order to measure the ﬁrst
three even zonal harmonics of the geopotential independently of each other
and of the relativistic eﬀects by means of suitable linear combinations of the
orbital residuals of the LAGEOS satellites and of Ajisai.

2 The linear combination approach and its main

features

2.1 Three possible combinations for J 2, J 4 and J 6

Let us consider the following linear combinations of the orbital residuals of
the rates of the longitudes of the ascending node Ω of the SLR satellites
LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and Ajisai and of the argument of perigee ω of LA-
GEOS II (See Appendix A for details). Their orbital parameters are quoted
in Table 1.

with the coeﬃcients ˙Ψ.ℓ of the classical precessions of degree ℓ = 4, 6 (see
Appendix B and Iorio 2003) and with the general relativistic precessions:

2.2 The analysis strategy

The residuals should be built up by adopting, as usual in precise orbit de-
termination process, a complete suite of dynamical force models and some
background reference model for the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld complete to
all available degree and order, apart from just the even zonal harmonic co-
eﬃcient which we are interested in. In this way the residuals should entirely
account for the secular precessions induced by that even zonal harmonic,
which we are interested in, and for the all other physical eﬀects, which we
are not interested in, according to the level of accuracy of the force mod-
els included in the orbital processor. It would be better to use some Earth
gravity models derived from CHAMP and/or GRACE only data, so to avoid
any possible ‘imprint’ due to the use of models in which the role played by
the laser-ranged satellites to be used in this analysis has been relevant.

f

obs = t(i)

For a given observational time span T (i)

− t0, the time series
of the left-hand-side of one of the combinations of eqs.(1)-(3) should be
analyzed in order to ﬁt and remove the time-varying harmonic perturbations
(lunisolar tides, direct solar radiation pressure, Earth albedo, etc.), ﬁt the
so obtained signal with a straight line, measure its slope, in deg day−1, and
normalizing it with X, Y or Z. The result would be the even zonal harmonic
Jℓ[t(i)
obs. For the same initial
epoch t0, this procedure should be repeated over increasing time spans with
f < t(2)
t(1)
, N ≥ 2 in order to have diﬀerent evaluations of Jℓ
at subsequent times. So, it would be possible to plot Jℓ(t) = J (0)
ℓ + ˙Jℓt; by
ﬁtting it with a straight line it would allow to measure the static part J (0)
and the secular rate ˙Jℓ of the considered even zonal harmonic.

f ] of interest, evaluated over the considered T (i)

f < ... < t(N )

The so-obtained values for J (0)

and ˙Jℓ would be, by construction, in-
dependent of the post-Newtonian orbital eﬀects and of the other two even
zonal harmonics. This feature could easily be checked by arbitrarily varying
in the force models the parameters characterizing such interactions: indeed,
if they really do not aﬀect the time series of the considered combination,
nothing should change in the recovered value of its slope.

A major source of systematic error would be represented by the impact
of the mismodelled even zonal harmonics of higher degree which are not can-
celled out by eqs.(1)-(3). E.g., eq.(2) is aﬀected by J8, J10, J12, ... It can be
evaluated, in a conservative way, by using the available sigmas of the variance
matrix of the adopted background reference model and by summing up the
individual secular precessions induced by the uncancelled mismodelled even
zonal coeﬃcients. According to the combined CHAMP+GRACE+terrestrial
gravimetry/altimetry EIGEN-CG01C Earth gravity model (Reigber et al.
2004), the systematic errors due to the uncancelled even zonal harmonics
= 8 × 10−12.
would be δJ (zon)
They are 1-sigma upper bounds obtained, in a conservative way, by sum-
ming up the absolute values of the individual mismodelled precessions. It
is interesting to note that the proposed determination of J4 and J6 would
not be biased by a number of eﬀects which, on the contrary, should be con-
sidered for J2. Among them there is the semisecular harmonic perturbation
induced by the 18.6–year tide because its major power is concentrated just
in the ℓ = 2 m = 0 constituent. Consequently, it would aﬀect, in principle,
the recovery of J2. According to recent estimates of the amplitudes of the
perturbations induced by it on the nodes of the LAGEOS satellites and the
perigee of LAGEOS II and of the level of misomodelling in the k2 Love num-
ber (1.5%) in terms of which they are expressed (Iorio 2001), the 18.6–year
tide should have an impact on the measurement of J2 of the order of 10−11
over one year. However, it might be a rather pessimistic estimate. Indeed,
the 18.6–year tide has been fully resolved thanks to very long time series of
data from LAGEOS and Starlette (Eanes and Bettadpur 1996), so that the
corresponding ﬁtted and recovered harmonic perturbation is available and
could be inserted in the force models2.

In regard to other sources of systematic errors, it is important to notice
that the impact of the non–gravitational perturbations aﬀecting especially
the perigee of LAGEOS II should be reduced by the fact that the coeﬃcients
with which it enters the three combinations are all of the order of 10−2. In
order to get an–order–of–magnitude estimate, some authors claim that the
non–gravitational perturbations aﬀecting the perigee of LAGEOS II could

of the reference Earth gravity model used in that analysis because in the LAGEOS and
Starlette adopted records it has described more than a full cycle.

have an impact on the performed Lense–Thirring tests of the order of 100%,
i.e. almost 60 mas yr−1 (Ciufolini 1996).
If so, the bias induced on our
proposed estimation of J2, J4 and J6 would be of the order of 10−13 over a
time span of, say, one year.

It is important to note that long total observational temporal intervals

A How to obtain the linear combinations

In order to determine the even zonal harmonics Jℓ it is convenient to consider
the temporal behavior averaged over many orbital revolutions of those Kep-
lerian orbital elements characterizing the orbit of an artiﬁcial Earth satellite
which, under such condition, undergo secular precessions. They are the node
Ω, the longitude of the perigee ω and the mean anomaly M; for a generic
satellite A we will denote any of them as ΨA. Among them, the node Ω is
by far the most accurately measurable. On the contrary, the perigee ω is
aﬀected by a host of non–gravitational perturbations which, in many cases,
are diﬃcult to be correctly modelled so that their impact on the recovery of
some parameter of interest by means of the perigee cannot often be reliably
assessed and evaluated. The same holds also for the mean anomaly M for
which the indirect perturbations on the mean motion n induced by the dis-
turbing accelerations aﬀecting the semimajor axis a are to be considered as
well.

It is well known that the multipolar expansion of the Earth’s geopotential
in spherical harmonics (Kaula 1966) leads to classical secular precessions of
the node, the perigee and the mean anomaly which are linear in the even
zonal harmonics Jℓ. Moreover, the Einstein General Theory of Relativity
(GTR in the following) predicts that additional secular precessions aﬀecting
the node and/or the perigee are also present. They are

Let us suppose, for the sake of concreteness, that we want to measure
′ in a relativity–free fashion.
The orbital residuals of a given Keplerian element account for any mis-
modelled or unmodelled physical phenomenon aﬀecting that element. Just
in order to illustrate the method in a concrete way, let us consider the orbital
residuals δ ˙Ψexp of the rates ˙Ψ for three satellites denoted as3 A, B and C and
assume that they entirely, or partly, account for one of the three features
for the relativistic
that we wish to measure separately of each other, i.e.
′
. In re-
eﬀects or the even zonal harmonic of degree ℓ or that of degree ℓ
gard to the even zonal harmonics, this means that we are using a somewhat
‘truncated’ Earth gravity model in the force model routines of the orbital
processor; in principle, it would include all the even zonal harmonics except
for that one in which we are interested in. We can write

The coeﬃcients ˙Ψ.ℓ have been explicitly worked out for Ψ ≡ Ω and Ψ ≡ ω
from ℓ = 2 to ℓ = 20 (Iorio 2003); it turns out that they are functions of the
semimajor axis a, the inclination i and the eccentricity e of the considered

(or mismodelling, if you prefer) characteristic of their models. If such force
models were perfect, such other eﬀects would not aﬀect the residuals δ ˙Ψ and
we would have ∆ = 0. In particular, we can include in them the mismod-
elled secular precessions induced by the remaining even zonal harmonics of
degree other than ℓ or ℓ

the Lense–Thirring experiment with the LAGEOS satellites. He derived a combination

the relativistic eﬀects which are a priori assumed to be valid and included
in the force models; this assumption for the gravitomagnetic force should

In Table 2 we quote the Newtonian secular precession coeﬃcients ˙Ψ.ℓ for
the nodes of LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and Ajisai and the perigee of LAGEOS
II from ℓ = 2 to ℓ = 6. In Table 3 we quote the post-Newtonian secular
precessions for the nodes of LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and Ajisai and the perigee
of LAGEOS II.

Abstract

The Tucunduba Dam is about 290 km West of Fortaleza, Cear´a
state. The seismic monitoring of the area, with a local network, has
began on June 11, 1997, soon after the occurrence of the event with
magnitude 3.2 mb on June 09, 1997. The monitoring was done with
one the analogical station (used for magnitude duration measurement
and statistical control activity) and seven digital stations. The digi-
tal stations, with three components each, were operated from June to
November 1997. In this work, the data collected during digital mon-
itoring was analyzed to determine hypocenters and focal mechanism.
To determine hypocenters, the HYPO71 program was used, with half-
space model, whose parameters were 5.95 km/s, for P-wave velocities,
and 1.69 for the ratio between P and S-wave velocity. The active zone
was nearly 1 km length, with depth between 4.5 and 5.2 km. With 16
events recorded in the same six stations, we determined the direction
of the fault plane (NE-SW). The fault mechanism is strike-slip with
a small normal component. The dip estimate was 65◦SE with FPFIT
and 80◦SE with FOCMEC. Preliminary estimates of maximum hori-
zontal compressive stress, using P-axis direction, were in accordance
with Ferreira et al.(1998). The small diﬀerence is probably due to
inﬂuence of the sedimentary basin in the regional stress. The active
area is in accordance with seismicity described by Assump¸c˜ao (1998),
i. e., the combination regional stress, local ﬂexural eﬀect from thick
sedimentary loads, and a presumably weaker crust from Mesozoic thin-
ning.

1 Introduction

The Northwest of Cear´a is an area of seismic activity known since the
XIX century (Ferreira & Assump¸c˜ao, 1983; Berrocal et al., 1984; Ferreira
et al., 1998). On June 09, 1997 (district of Serrota, Senador S´a-CE), an
event with magnitude mb = 3.2 (Intensity III-IV MM) happened, scaring the
local population. The growth of the seismic activity in Serrota, specially in
the Tucunduba Reservoir, led the UFRN to study the seismic activity, to
determine the hypocenter and displacement mechanism with large precision
and to try to understand the local seismicity.

For this study, an analogical station and a digital network with seven
stations were installed (Figure 1). The analogical station operated from
June 11, 1997 to August 14, 1998 and the digital network from June 18
to November 05, 1997. The analogical station was used in the statistics
of the earthquakes as well as to obtain the magnitude with the duration,
using the same parameters presented by Blum & Assump¸c˜ao (1990), since
the analogical station operated in the same conditions.

2 Geological comments

The seismic area is part of the Borborema province which is divided in
ﬁve tectonic domains (Brito Neves et al., 2000). The Northwest of Cear´a is
divided by two of these domains; the Medium Corea´u Domain (MCO) and
the Cear´a Central Domain (CC).

The MCO Domain is situated between the margin of the S˜ao Luis-West
Africa craton and the Transbrasiliano/Kandi Lineament. The domain con-
sists of basement (2.5 Ga) high-grade methamorphic rocks and pelitic-carbo-
nate fold belts. Along the Transbrasiliano lineament occured a series of
transtensional basin transpressional and post-orogenic plutons occupying
pull-apart; many of these are covered by the Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks
of the Parna´ıba Basin (Gusm˜ao, 1998).

The CC domain is situated between the Transbrasiliano/Kandi lineament
and the Senador Pompeu lineament (Figure 2). This domain consists of
gneissic basement formed during the Transamazonian collage, with invulsion
of an Archean nucleus. The basement has 2.2 and 2.1 Ga. The domain
also contains a series of middle Neoproterozoic supracrustal sequences or
remanent of folds belts and expressive Brasiliano plutonism.

The dam is located in the bound of the MCO domain and coverings
Phanerozoic. Close to the dam, there is a sucession of horst and grabens
(Torquato & Nogueira Neto, 1996).

3 Seismic Activity

The large event recorded in the Tucunduba Dam, with magnitude 3.2
mb, was on June 9th, 1997 and was felt mainly in Serrota, a small villages
of Senador S´a, by the margins of the dam (Figure 1), where roofs were
shaken, glasses of stores balanced, school materials were dropped oﬀ desks
and, the inhabitants were afraid (Fran¸ca, 1999). Then, on June 11th, 1997,
the analogical seismograph station, with MEQ-800 smooked paper recorder
(SN1A), was installed. Seven digital short period portable stations were also
installed, on June 18, 1997. Except the station SN03, all the stations were
installed in granitic/gneissic bedrocks of the crystalline basement, allowing
low noise and clear P and S wave arrivals. The digital stations clocks were
corrected once each hour with GPS and P-wave readings had accuracy to
±0.001s.

The station SN1A operated from June 11, 1997 to August 14, 1998,
recording a total of 2217 events (Figure 3), and the largest magnitude was
mb = 3.0 on December 12, 1997.

3.1 Determination of Hypocenters

Hypocenters were determined with the program HYPO71 (Lee & Lahr,
1975). The half-space velocity model has been producing good results when
applied to several areas of Brazilian Northeast (Ferreira et al., 1987; 1995;
1998; Takeya et al., 1989; do Nascimento, 1997). This half-space model was
adopted, since the seismic area is in the precambrian basement composed
of consolidated rocks and low attenuation, generating clear P and S waves
arrivals in the seismographs (Figure 4).

Various tests were made to ﬁnd the best P velocity (vP ) and (vP /vS)
ratio. We varied P wave velocity between 5.4 and 6.45 km/s and vP /vS ratio
between 1.60 and 1.74. The velocity model with the lowest root mean square
(rms) time residual had vP /vS = 1.69 and vP = 5.95 km/s. The value for vP
is acceptable, since in diﬀerent parts of the world, the vP in granitic/gneissic
upper crustal rocks varies from 5.8 to 6.4 km/s (Christensen, 1982; Chris-
tensen & Mooney, 1995). For this model, all 160 selected events (recorded
by at the least four stations) had rms residual 0.03 sec and horizontal errors
less than 0.5 km. The most of the events have rms ≤ 0.01, erh ≤ 0.1 km
and erz ≤ 0.1 km, constitutes a set of weel determinated. This is basically
due the site of deployment (mainly bedrock), the stations near the epicentral
area anda sample rate of 500 sample per second.

Figure 5 shows the epicenters of the events with rms residuais less than
0.03 sec and horizontal errors less than 0.5 km, recorded during the digital

3

network operation. As can be seen, all events occurred inside the lake, with
about 1 km length and depths between 4.5 and 5.2 km. We do not know
the eﬀect of the water in the trigger, since the dam is very old, shallow and
seismic activity is not known previous

4 Fault plane

To estimate the fault plane, we used 16 well-located events recorded at
the same six stations (Table 1, Figure 6). The hypocenters were distributed
in 0.3 km length, with depth varying from 4.68 to 4.87 km (Figure 7).

Starting from these data, we determined, by least squares, the direction
and the dip of the fault plane. The azimuth was 60◦ ± 10◦ and the dip
88◦ ± 11◦. Projections of the hypocenters used in the calculation, in parallel
and perpendicular plans to the fault plan, are shown in the Figure 7. The
vertical and horizontal maximum errors observed for that set of data were
0.1 km, while the range of the active zone was of 0.3 km and the variation in
depth was of 0.2 km. In these conditions, the hypocentral data can provide
only a rough estimate of the fault plane orientation.

5 Focal mechanisms

Composite focal mechanisms were determined using clear P wave ﬁrst mo-
tions with aid of the FPFIT program (Reasenberg & Oppenheimer, 1985).
FPFIT program does a grid search to ﬁnd the solution that minimizes a
weighted sum of discrepancies in the polarities, considering both the esti-
mated variance of the data and the theoretical P wave radiation amplitude
(Reasenberg & Oppenheimer, 1985). The individual focal mechanisms were
determined using S/P amplitudes ratios in additition to P wave ﬁrst motions,
according to the method of Kisslinger (1980) and Kisslinger et al. (1982). For
individual focal mechanism, we used the FOCMEC program (Snoke et al.,
1984), which does a grid search of the nodal parameters to ﬁnd the solution
the best ﬁts the observed log (amplitude ratio).

Firstly, with the 16 events of Table 1 we used the fault plane obtained
by least square with reference, we estimated the composite focal mechanism
(with number of P + S readings ≥ 12 and at least ﬁve clear P onset). Added
the short-period station located in Sobral-CE (SB17), epicentral distance of
85.5 km, for the two largest events in Table 1 (Event 1 and 2). To deter-
mine the focal mechanism by using FPFIT, we limited the fault plane near
60◦ with range 30◦ and result of the composite focal mechanism (azimuth,

4

dip and the rake), shown in the Table 2–Figure 9. The solution of the focal
mechanism is approximately a NE-SW fault, with strike-slip dextral move-
ment with normal component. The fault plane was chosen by taking into
account the hypocentral distribution (Figure 6). The composite focal mech-
anism solution is a strike-slip type, which is predominant in the northeast
of Brazil (Assump¸c˜ao et al., 1985; 1989; Ferreira et al., 1995; 1998). The
direction of the P axis (278◦), obtained by FPFIT, diﬀers from 6◦ of the
maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax), obtained by Ferreira et al.
(1998) in NE Cear´a region.

Secondly, seven events of Table 1 were selected (Table 3), by using as
selection criterion the largest number of clear polarities of the S wave. The
results obtained through the FOCMEC are in Table 3, limiting the range
of orientation and dip of the axes B (null axis), and A and N (correspond
to Herrmann’s X and Y axes), with step 2◦. The events are numbered in
accordance with Table 1 and the best solutions of focal mechanisms with its
P and T axes, for the reliable mechanisms for FOCMEC. The results showed
a predominance of strike-slip mechanism (1, 11, 14, 15 and 16). Event 6
has normal mechanism and event 13 a normal with strike-slip component.
Without considering the dip, several mechanisms have close direction to the
estimated azimuth with previous methods (60◦)(Table 3).

The average strike for all events was 65◦. The average dip was 80◦. These
average values were close the values obtained by ﬁtting of the fault plane by
least squares and composite focal mechanisms (FPFIT).

To estimate SHmax with individual focal mechanism, we did an average of
the P-axes directions (for the events of mechanism strike-slip) and B-axes (for
the events of normal mechanism). The obtained value was 258◦, between the
values obtained by FPFIT for direction of the P axis (278◦) and the value of
SHmax for the northwestest Cear´a (293◦) obtained by Ferreira et al. (1998).

6 Discussion

A network composed by seven portable digital stations was used to mon-
itoring the seismic activity in the Tucunduba Dam, almost all installed in
granitic/gneissic bedrocks of the crystalline basement. It was possible to ob-
tain records of good quality, with clear P and S waves. Besides, the network
conﬁguration has two stations that were installed close to the epicentral area.
Thus, it was possible to determine the hypocenters with good accuracy.

The active zone was too small, less than about 1 km length and depth
varying from 4.5 to 5.2 km, considering all events analyzed. It was inside the
Tucunduba Reservoir.

5

The set of 16 events recorded by the same six stations was selected from
the method of the least square, obtaing values of 60◦ for the azimuth and 88◦
for the dip.

The focal mechanism solution shows a NE-SW fault, with strike-slip dex-
tral movement with normal component. The fault plane was chosen by taking
into account the hypocentral distribution (Figure 6). The direction of the
axes P (278◦), obtained by composite focal mechanism, diﬀers 15◦ of the
direction of the horizontal maximum stress (SHmax), obtained by Ferreira et
al. (1998).
In the determination of individual focal mechanisms, there is
three or four stations with the same polarities, which may be indicated that
mechanisms is not change, thus the strike-slip mechanism (four) is fully with
expected results. The average direction of the individual planes ranges from
65◦ to the azimuth and 80◦ for the dip, which are close to the values obtained
by the composite mechanism and least squares. As the direction of horizon-
tal maximum stress (SHmax) was 258◦, it diﬀers 6◦ of the best estimated by
Ferreira et al. (1998).

The seismic activity is located in the border of the basin, common charac-
teristic of the seismicity of the Northeast (Assump¸c˜ao, 1998; Ferreira et al.,
1998). The focal mechanism and fault plane estimated (the strike-slip type)
is predominant in the Northeast of Brazil (Assump¸c˜ao et al., 1985; 1989;
Ferreira et al., 1995; 1998). The SHmax estimated has a small diﬀerence.
Probably, that diﬀerence is because Ferreira et al., (1998) used events to the
South of the active area and that the line of the coast suﬀers more ﬂexural
eﬀect than area to the South.

The NW area of Cear´a was analyzed up to now with events that happened
on the basements, the seismic area of the Tucunduba reservoir is consistent
with stress regime (Ferreira et al., 1998), in other words, SHmax parallel the
Northeast coast, where this active is of the border of the boundary basin.

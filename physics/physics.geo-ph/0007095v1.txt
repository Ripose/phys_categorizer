seismic precursors of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake

Abstract. Based on several empirical evidence, a series of papers has
advocated the concept that seismicity prior to a large earthquake can be
understood in terms of the statistical physics of a critical phase transition.
In this model, the cumulative seismic Benioﬀ strain release ǫ increases as a
power-law time-to-failure before the ﬁnal event. This power law reﬂects a
kind of scale invariance with respect to the distance to the critical point: ǫ
is the same up to a simple rescaling λz after the time-to-failure has been
scaled by a factor λ. A few years ago, on the basis of a ﬁt of the cumulative
Benioﬀ strain released prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, Sornette
and Sammis [1995] proposed that this scale invariance could be partially
broken into a discrete scale invariance, deﬁned such that the scale invariance
occurs only with respect to speciﬁc integer powers of a fundamental scale
ratio. The observable consequence of discrete scale invariance takes the form
of log-periodic oscillations decorating the accelerating power law. They found
that the quality of the ﬁt and the predicted time of the event are signiﬁcantly
improved by the introduction of log-periodicity. Here, we present a battery
of synthetic tests performed to quantify the statistical signiﬁcance of this
claim. We put special attention to the deﬁnition of synthetic tests that are
as much as possible identical to the real time series except for the property
to be tested, namely log-periodicity. Without this precaution, we would
conclude that the existence of log-periodicity in the Loma Prieta cumulative
Benioﬀ strain is highly statistically signiﬁcant.
log-periodic oscillations with frequency and regularity similar to those of the
Loma Prieta case are very likely to be generated by the interplay of the low
pass ﬁltering step due to the construction of cumulative functions together
with the approximate power law acceleration. Thus, the single Loma Prieta
case alone cannot support the initial claim and additional cases and further
study are needed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio if any. The present study
will be a useful methodological benchmark for future testing of additional
events when the methodology and data to construct reliable Benioﬀ strain
function become available.

In contrast, we ﬁnd that

1. Introduction

The idea that earthquakes are somewhat analogous
to critical phenomena of statistical mechanics has been
gaining ground in the last few decades [Chelidze, 1982;
All`egre et al., 1982; Sornette and Sornette, 1990; Tu-
markin and Shnirman, 1992; Sornette and Sammis,
1995; Newman et al., 1995; Bowman et al., 1998; Jaume
and Sykes, 1999]. One of the consequences of this
new point of view is that events occurring even several
decades before a large main shock can be considered as
seismic precursors, and that a study of this precursory
seismicity might give a fairly good indication of when
the impending major earthquake will take place, and
how big it is going to be. Although such considerations
are still in infancy, and the usual caveats about earth-
quake prediction must be kept in one’s mind, a lot of
work has already been devoted to “post-diction”, some-
times with impressive success. One of the pioneering
cases in that direction was the 1989 Loma Prieta earth-
quake, where Sornette and Sammis [1995] proposed to
see the empirical power law used by Bufe and Varnes
[1993] in the perspective of criticality in the sense of
statistical physics [Sornette, 2000]. They found that
the cumulative Benioﬀ strain starting about 50 years
ago could be well-ﬁtted with a power law, giving rise
to a post-diction for the main event of (1990.3 ± 4.1), a
reasonably satisfactory result.

Things got even more exciting after the paper of Sor-
nette and Sammis [1995] where it was pointed out that
the strong oscillations around the power law could be
ﬁtted as well using a complex exponent correction to
scaling:

ǫ(t) = A + B(tf − t)z{1 + C cos[ω log(tf − t) + φ]} . (1)

In this formula, the parameter tf is the time of the
main shock (a pure power law would correspond to
C = 0), and the best ﬁt gave rise to an estimate
tf = 1989.9 ± 0.8, considerably closer to the real date
than the one in [Bufe and Varnes, 1993], and with much
less uncertainty.

The existence of complex correction to scaling ex-
ponents could be linked to an underlying discrete scale
invariance, a very appealing property from a theoretical
point of view: the initial observation in [Sornette and
Sammis, 1995] therefore spurred a lot of development
[Saleur et al., 1996a, b; Johansen et al., 1996; Huang
et al., 1998; Sornette, 1998; Bowman et al., 1998; Jo-

hansen et al., 2000; Sammis and Smith, 1999; Jaume
and Sykes, 1999].

Although the quality of the ﬁt in Sornette and Sam-
mis [1995] is, to the naked eye,
impressively good,
the suspicion arose recently that the oscillations in the
Loma Prieta Benioﬀ strain could be merely the result of
noise. The synthetic tests performed in [Sornette and
Sammis, 1995] being somewhat incomplete, we have de-
cided to reanalyze this question much more carefully in
the present work.

We have performed two types of synthetic tests to do

this re-analysis.

In the ﬁrst type, we consider random power laws (ex-
plained in Section 3), with parameters that match those
of the real data, and study whether noise can give rise
to log-periodic structures after integration. The advan-
tage of this approach is that the two key ingredients of
the analysis of the real data (power law and integration)
are captured in a simple way. Its drawback is that the
synthetic data (a sequence of random numbers drawn
from a power law probability distribution, from which
a cumulative quantity is constructed) is not quite of the
same nature than the real data (a sequence of times and
magnitudes, from which the cumulative Benioﬀ strain
is constructed). In particular, the sampling for the syn-
thetic data is essentially periodic in log scale, and this
eﬀect, combined with integration, is expected to give
rise to spurious log-periodic oscillations indeed. Nev-
ertheless, we ﬁnd the consideration of these synthetic
tests quite useful, as it complement the considerations
in [Huang et al., 2000].

The second type of synthetic tests is devised es-
pecially to avoid this issue of sampling: we generate
data for both time and magnitude, in such a way that
the probability distributions of the synthetic (ts, ms)
and the real (tr, mr) quantities are the same. There
is a problem in doing so: although the synthetic data
and the real data have the same distribution, there is
no guarantee that the cumulative Benioﬀ strain con-
structed form the synthetic sequences is really a power
law, because a power law dependence involves higher-
order statistics (i.e., correlation and dependence) not
captured by the one-point distribution functions. To
preserve the feature of the real data that events are
more frequent and with higher magnitudes when closer
to the main shock (or the last data point), we added
a reordering procedure which shuﬄes the synthetic se-
quences in such a way that the event with the jth mag-
nitude is at the same position as the real event with the
jth magnitude in the real sequence.

We ﬁnd that for both type of synthetic tests, it is,

LOMA PRIETA LOG-PERIODICITY

surprisingly, highly possible to get spurious (that is, en-
tirely due to noise) log-periodic oscillations which are
as good as those observed in the real Loma Prieta data.
This conclusion is made quantitative in a variety of
ways, in particular by studying the highest peak of the
spectrum of oscillations around the power law for the
real data, and building the probability distribution of
such peaks for synthetic data. We thus conclude that,
at the present time, it is not possible to distinguish the
log-periodic oscillations observed in [Sornette and Sam-
mis, 1995] from noise.

The present study is related to [Huang et al., 2000].
The common theme is the investigation of the condi-
tions under which log-periodicity can be created spon-
taneously by noise.
In [Huang et al., 2000], the goal
is to study in details the underlying mechanism, re-
lying solely on the manipulation of data: the gener-
ally found non-uniform sampling together with a low
pass ﬁltering step, as occurs in constructing cumulative
functions, in maximum likelihood estimations and de-
trending, is enough to create apparent log-periodicity.
A detailed exploration of this mechanism has been of-
fered in [Huang et al., 2000] together with extensive
numerical simulations to demonstrate all its main prop-
erties. It was shown that this “synthetic” scenario for
log-periodicity relies on two steps: 1) the fact that ap-
proximately logarithmic sampling in time corresponds
to uniform sampling in the logarithm of time; 2) integra-
tion reddens the noise and, in a ﬁnite sample, creates
a maximum in the spectrum leading to a most prob-
able frequency in the logarithm of time.
In [Huang
et al., 2000], this insight was then use to to analyze
the 27 best aftershock sequences studied by [Kisslinger
and Jones, 1991] and search for traces of genuine log-
periodic corrections to Omori’s law, which states that
the earthquake rate decays approximately as the inverse
of the time since the last main shock. The observed log-
periodicity was shown to almost entirely result from the
“synthetic scenario” due to the data analysis. From
a statistical point of view, resolving the issue of the
possible existence of log-periodicity in aftershocks will
be very diﬃcult as Omori’s law describes a point pro-
cess with a uniform sampling in the logarithm of the
time. By construction, strong log-periodic ﬂuctuations
are thus created by this logarithmic sampling. In con-
trast, in the present paper, we apply the insight ob-
tained in [Huang et al., 2000], to study accelerated
power laws culminating in a ﬁnite-time singularity at
time tf .

To be complete, we should also point out the fol-
lowing. Sornette and Sammis [1995] paper contains a

forward prediction of an earthquake in the Komman-
dorski Island region at time tf = 1996.3 ± 1.1 year.
Forward predictions provide a much larger statistical
signiﬁcance since the model parameters are estimated
independently and outside their domain of application
(see below the discussion in the section on the analy-
sis procedure). Forward prediction has also the qual-
ity of increasing the number of cases. The prediction
of a critical time is not enough, one must specify the
magnitude of the predicted earthquake.
In [Sornette
and Sammis, 1995], the magnitude was not speciﬁed
but can probably be taken following the speciﬁcation
of Bufe et al. [1994] of a magnitude in the range 7.5-
8.5 occurring in a zone originally outlined by Nishenko
[1991]. The largest earthquake in the Harvard catalog
during the time period 1994-1998 has a moment mag-
nitude MW = 6.6 (1996/07/16, 56.16N, 164.98E). The
same event has the magnitude MS = 6.4 in the PDE
catalog. If the prediction is considered correct only if
both its time and magnitude range is as predicted, this
prediction is a failure. However, it is hard to draw any
ﬁrm conclusion based on this single case with respect
to usefulness of the critical earthquake concept and of
log-periodicity as the methodology has evolved signiﬁ-
cantly since the initial paper of Sornette and Sammis
[1995] (see for instance [Bowman et al., 1998; Ouillon
and Sornette, 2000]).

The plan of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we
present some general observations on synthetic tests and
their interpretations. Details on our two types of tests,
together with their results, are presented in Sections 3
and 4. Our conclusions are collected in Section 5.

2. Analysis Procedure

Usually, the major problem in establishing the sta-
tistical signiﬁcance of a forecasting procedure is its ret-
rospective character involving a limited number of data
and a signiﬁcant number of explicit (the parameters of
the ﬁt) and implicit (the total time and space windows
used, etc.) degrees of freedom. In such situations, the
calculation of statistical signiﬁcance becomes very dif-
ﬁcult and uncertain as soon as the adjustable parame-
ters are determined from the data. The conclusions can
then be artifacts of the processing technique or of a se-
lection bias. The paper of Sornette and Sammis [1995]
certainly suﬀers from this problem. Since there are no
general methods or techniques that would allow us to
overcome these diﬃculties, we stick to a more modest
approach, which turns out to be suﬃcient to draw a
clear and meaningful conclusion.

4

HUANG ET AL.

We develop two types of synthetic tests. For both
types, the key part is the comparison of the log-periodic
oscillations in the real seismicity to those in the syn-
thetic sequences. Similar oscillations should have simi-
lar frequencies and similar regularities, and this can best
be quantiﬁed by considering the spectrum of these os-
cillations. We focus on the highest peak (characterized
by angular frequency ω and peak height h) in the spec-
trum, which quantiﬁes the most signiﬁcant frequency
component in the oscillations as a function of log(tf − t)
(since we are looking for log-periodicity). The Lomb
method [Press et al., 1992] is used instead of the usual
Fourier Transform, since the data points are not equidis-
tantly spaced.

The ultimate purpose of synthetic tests is to get
the signiﬁcance level (the probability of getting the
same thing by accident) of the real observation. One
natural way of evaluating the signiﬁcance level would
be, it seems, to count the number of synthetic peaks
(deﬁned as spectral components with spectral power
higher than neighboring frequencies,
in other words,
local maximums in the spectrum) within the intervals
ωs ∈ [ωr − ∆, ωr + ∆] and hs ≥ hr (superscript s, r de-
note synthetic and real data respectively), and to nor-
malize this by the total number of synthetic peaks. This
might however lead to incorrect conclusions. For in-
stance, suppose that, from 10000 synthetic peaks, only
one peak with peak height higher than 10 (the height
of the real peak) and angular frequency ω in the range
of [π, 2π] was found: could we conclude that the sig-
niﬁcance level is 0.01% (or conﬁdence level of 99.99%)?
Probably not. To see why, suppose the distribution of
ω’s were uniform in [0, 40], and the distribution in peak
height uniform in [6.862, 10.004]: then the probability
of observing one peak of height above 10 and ω ∈ [π, 2π]
would roughly be 1/10000. But this small probability
does not mean that the peak of height above 10 and
ω ∈ [π, 2π] is highly signiﬁcant! Due to the uniform
distribution in both ω and peak height, any other pair
of (ω, h) would have, in fact, been observed with the
same probability. To draw positive conclusions from
such a simple counting analysis, one would need to have
in advance a theory indicating where the peak should
be found, and approximately at what height. It is not
clear that there is such a thing at present, and therefore
we prefer to use a more conservative approach.

In the language of statistics, this question is related
to the diﬀerence between ﬁrst-order and second-order
statistics. In ﬁrst-order statistics, we ask: “what is the
probability to observe the peak we see just by chance?”
In second-order statistics, we ask: “what is the prob-

ability to observe some (ﬁrst-order signiﬁcant) peak
somewhere (whatever its position)?” In our context,
the determination of the conﬁdence level within ﬁrst-
order statistics requires that we have an a priori under-
standing of where the peak should be found.

In the absence of any theoretical predictions, it seems
natural, to quantify the signiﬁcance level of the log-
periodic oscillations, to rely somehow on the probabil-
ity distribution of ω and peak height in the synthetic
samples, i.e. to rely on second-order statistics. We have
not managed to come up with a totally satisfactory, ob-
jective way to use this probability distribution however.
A useful quantity we came up with–but it should not
be trusted blindly–is the ratio R of the probability of
observing a given peak to the probability of observing
the most probable peak: if the ratio is close to 1, this
surely indicates that the peak is not very signiﬁcant.

To obtain this ratio, one needs the probability den-
sity function p(ω, h) of the synthetic peaks: the latter
can be constructed using the Kernel Density method
[Silverman, 1986; Beardah, 1995]. We then set R =
p(ωr ,hr) dω dh
p(ωmp,hmp) dω dh where (ωr, hr) characterize the real peak,
and (ωmp, hmp) is the most probable synthetic peak.
The ratio quantiﬁes how frequently in synthetic se-
quences we can observe log-periodicity similar to that
observed in the real sequence. There are some technical
advantages in using this ratio. For instance, there is in
fact no arbitrariness in choosing the intervals dω and
dh, since they cancel out between the numerator and
the denominator: it is then enough to just use the func-
tion value of p(ω, h) at (ωr, hr) and (ωmp, hmp). Also,
the special choices (e.g., the degree of smoothing and
the type of kernels) made in constructing the probabil-
ity density function p(ω, h) hopefully also cancel out in
the ratio, and have little inﬂuence on the ﬁnal result.

The generation of synthetic data and extraction of
oscillations depend on the type of synthetic tests and
will be explained separately in the following sections.

3. Synthetic Test I

3.1. Generation of Synthetic Data

We start from a simple method which takes into ac-
count the most crucial features of the real data. We
then reﬁne this method in several ways in Section 4.

The crucial features of the real data are power law
and integration. The latter–considering the cumula-
tive Benioﬀ strain–is necessary for numerical reasons,
as there are not enough data points to study directly
the rate at which energy is released (moreover, consid-

LOMA PRIETA LOG-PERIODICITY

5

ering the rate leads to other diﬃculties, like the inﬂu-
ence of the binning intervals etc). We therefore take
a pure power law as the null hypothesis, and generate
data with a probability density ﬁtting the power law
part of dǫ/dt: we mimic real data as closely as possi-
ble, taking in particular the same number of points. We
then construct a synthetic cumulative Benioﬀ strain by
numerical integration, and investigate whether noise in
the sampling of the power law can give rise to spurious
log-periodic oscillations.

Again, the power law is

dǫ(t)

dt

∝ (tf − t)m−1

(2)

following (1) in [Sornette and Sammis, 1995]. We as-
sume the range for t is [t0, t1] with t1 < tf to avoid the
singularity at tf . After normalization, we have

3.2. Extraction of Oscillations

The original analysis procedure used in [Sornette and
Sammis, 1995] was to ﬁt the cumulative Benioﬀ strain
to a power law with log-periodic oscillations ((1), the
same as (8) in [Sornette and Sammis, 1995]). The qual-
ity of the observed log-periodicity was not quantiﬁed
in [Sornette and Sammis, 1995] other than by showing
that the quality of the ﬁt measured by the residue as
well as the predicted critical time tf were both substan-
tially improved compared to those from the ﬁt with the
simple power law, but for our study, it is crucial to do
so.

To get the oscillations, we ﬁrst ﬁt a power law with
log-periodic oscillations (1) to both the real and syn-
thetic data. The pure power law part (obtained by set-
ting C = 0 in (1) is then subtracted, and we obtain the
remaining oscillations. These oscillations are in turn
analyzed using the procedure outlined in Section 2.

3.3. Results

For the real seismic precursors, t is the time of occur-
rence of an earthquake, for synthetic events t is a ran-
dom variable with probability function p(t) = dǫ(t)
dt . To
make sure the synthetic events and the real seismic pre-
cursors have the same power law distribution, we chose
the same parameters t0, t1, tf , m, N (from Table I
and Figure 1 of [Sornette and Sammis, 1995]), where
N is the number of events. (Since the original data was
not available at the time of this study, we retrieved
data from the CNSS catalog using their space-time-
magnitude window. However, due to some unknown
reason, our data set was slightly diﬀerent from their
data set. We got only 27 events instead of 31.) The ran-
dom variable t with given p(t) can be transformed from
a random variable x uniformly distributed on [x0, x1]
by solving [Press et al., 1992]

p(x)dx = p(t)dt.

The transformation is

t = tf − [(tf − t0)m

−

x − x0
x1 − x0

((tf − t0)m − (tf − t1)m)(cid:21)

. (4)

We then construct the cumulative distribution function
of t and use this function to mimic the cumulative Be-
nioﬀ strain of the real sequence. They have the same
power law parameters and they are both, indeed con-
structed from integration.

3.3.1. The real sequence. We ﬁrst characterize
the log-periodicity observed in the real sequence. The
ﬁt of (1) to the real data is remarkable (Figure 1). The
oscillations around the power law part show approxi-
mately 2.5 cycles of regular oscillations (Figure 2), the
spectrum of which has a peak near ωr ∼ 6.1 with height
hr ∼ 7.5 (Figure 3), which is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
Gaussian noise (the chance of observing such a peak
from Gaussian noise of the same number of data points
is less than 2% according to (13.8.7) of [Press et al.,
1992].). However, since we are dealing with oscilla-
tions around a cumulative quantity, integrated Gaus-
sian noise would be a more appropriate null hypothesis.
We will study the chance of observing such a peak from
integrated Gaussian noise in Section 3.3.2.

3.3.2. Synthetic sequences. 300 synthetic

sequences were generated using the parameters of the
seismic precursors for the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
They were analyzed in the same way as the real precur-
sor sequence. See Figures 4, 5, and 6 for typical re-
sults. We note that it is possible to observe synthetic
sequences which are remarkably similar to the real se-
quence: similar amplitude of oscillations, similar fre-
quency, and similar regularity.
In the following part,
we quantify how frequently such sequences can actually
be observed.

The distribution function of the frequencies and peak
heights of the synthetic sequences were constructed us-
ing the Kernel Density method [Silverman, 1986; Bear-
dah, 1995] (Figure 7). The real peak is not far from

4.1. Generation of Synthetic Data

For synthetic tests to be eﬀective, the synthetic
data should diﬀer from the real ones by only one
characteristic–the characteristic to be tested. Since in
our problem we want to test log-periodicity in the oscil-
lations around a power law, the synthetic data should

the most probable synthetic peak. From the distribu-
tion function (Figure 7), we ﬁnd that the probability
density function at the most probable synthetic peak is
proportional to 0.031, while it is proportional to 0.016
at value of ω and h corresponding to the real peak. The
ratio of these two quantities is close to one half. If we
look at the separate distribution of frequencies and peak
heights (Figures 9 and 10), we see that the frequency
from the real sequence is slightly higher than the most
probable synthetic peak, and the peak height of the real
sequence is almost the most probable synthetic peak
height. Note that the frequencies from synthetic se-
quences have a rather narrow distribution, as expected
from [Huang, 1999; Huang et al., 2000]. The regularity
of oscillations observed in the real sequence (Figure 1,
quantiﬁed by the peak height) is not surprising due to
the strong smoothing eﬀect of integration [Huang, 1999;
Huang et al., 2000]. When the same analysis procedure
was applied to both the real data and the synthetic
data, this kind of regularity is observed in both the real
data and the synthetic data.

be the same power law but with known noise (could be
additional data errors or random ﬂuctuations.). Since
the power law of the cumulative Benioﬀ strain is in fact
implied by the magnitude distribution and the tempo-
ral spacing between events and their correlations, we
have to generate synthetic magnitude ms and time ts
to get the same power law. ts and ms should be random
numbers having the same probability distribution as t
and m, because in our observations we had control over
neither t nor m. In this light, the analysis in Section 3
is thus a bit oversimpliﬁed; we now reﬁne it.

One diﬃculty in generating synthetic ts and ms is
that the theoretical probability density function (pdf )
of magnitudes and times for our real data is unknown.
This problem can be solved by using the empirical pdf
constructed from the real data. However, we should
not use the empirical pdf directly, otherwise all features
of the real data would be reproduced in the synthetic
data. For example, the empirical distribution of the
real time sequence (Figure 11) shows some regular os-
cillations (that could well be genuine physically-based
log-periodic oscillations) around its general trend.

If we used exactly this empirical distribution to gen-
erate the synthetic time sequences, all synthetic se-
quences would show similar regular oscillations: this
is of course not appropriate, since what we want to test
is precisely whether these oscillations are the result of
noise. Therefore, we decided to use only the general
trend of the experimental data to generate our synthetic
samples. This general trend is obtained by smoothing

the empirical distribution. Three-point moving average
was applied repeatedly 50 times (10 for smoothing the
cumulative distribution function of magnitudes). The
number of times is not crucial as long as the oscilla-
tions were wiped out. The criteria for our choice are
closeness to the empirical curve and lack of oscillations.
Similar considerations were applied to the generation
of synthetic magnitude sequence. The assumption for
the general trend was not crucial. A reasonable one,
close to the empirical cumulative distribution curve but
without the ﬂuctuations, would suﬃce.

The next diﬃculty is that, for a sequence of times
and magnitudes generated using this method, there is
no guarantee that the cumulative Benioﬀ strain will fol-
low a power law. The time sequence more or less follows
a power law (we have veriﬁed that the cumulative num-
ber of events of the seismic precursors of the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake is similar to the cumulative Benioﬀ
strain in power law and log-periodic oscillations), but,
when combined with the magnitude sequence to con-
struct the whole Benioﬀ strain curve, there is no ob-
vious reason why we should always get a power law.
It is natural to expect that the power law of the real
sequence comes mainly from the fact that events oc-
cur more frequently with increasing magnitude (trend
only) when closer to the main shock. To preserve this
feature in the synthetic sequences, we decided to re-

that the event of the kth magnitude would oc-

kth one in the sequence). This reordering scheme
is applied only to the magnitude sequence (time
sequence is an ordered sequence by deﬁnition).
One example is shown in Figures 12 and 13.

We performed synthetic tests both with and
without the reordering scheme. In fact, the re-

sults turned out to be almost identical.

4.2. Extraction of Oscillations

The method of extracting oscillations from
the cumulative Benioﬀ strain is slightly diﬀerent
from that of Section 3.2, however the diﬀerence
turns out to be insigniﬁcant.

Two ways are possible to obtain the oscilla-
tions: the ﬁrst involves extracting the best-ﬁt
power law from the real data. The drawback
of this approach is that power law ﬁts are often
not as stable as ﬁts including the log-periodic
corrections. Sometimes (around 8% of all cases)
the ﬁt even converges to a tf smaller than the
time of the last data point, thus tf − t is neg-
ative and (tf − t)(m−1) is complex since m < 1,
which is of course unphysical. The advantage of
this approach is that log-periodicity is not as-
sumed in the ﬁrst place. The second approach
involves extracting the power law obtained from
a best-ﬁt power law with log-periodic oscilla-
tions [Johansen and Sornette, 1999a, b; Johansen
et al., 1999]. The advantage here is that the ﬁt
always converges well, but now log-periodicity
is somewhat assumed from the very beginning.
The more positive view point advocated in [Jo-
hansen and Sornette, 1999a, b; Johansen et al., 1999]
to justify this procedure is that ﬁtting with log-
periodicity allows one to take the most probably
noise into account [Huang et al., 2000] and thus to
obtain a good pure power law representation by
putting the coeﬃcient C = 0. In practice, the
results of either approach were very similar: in
the following, we report only the results using
the second one.

It is of course crucial to use exactly the same
analysis procedure for both the real data and
the synthetic data, otherwise features generated
by the analysis procedure for the real data may
not be detected by the synthetic tests.

The cumulative Benioﬀ strain was ﬁrst con-

structed from the magnitude sequence mi:

ǫi =

i

Xj=1

100.75mj

(5)

and then normalized such that ǫmax = 1 (the
unit was changed without inﬂuencing the con-
clusion). As in [Sornette and Sammis, 1995], the
cumulative Benioﬀ strain was then ﬁtted to a
power law with log-periodic oscillations.

4.3. Results

4.3.1. The real sequence. The ﬁtting of the
real data showed good agreement between the
real data and the theoretical curve (Figure 14).
There was a peak at ω = 6.1 in the spectrum
of the de-trended data (Figure 16), close to the
best-ﬁt parameter ω = 5.7.

4.3.2. Synthetic sequences.

1000 synthetic se-
quences (one example in Figures 12 and 13) were
analyzed using the same procedure as that for
the real sequence. The cumulative Benioﬀ strain
of the synthetic sequence showed obvious simi-
larity to the real data (Figure 17).

We ﬁrst checked whether the synthetic data
gave rise to power laws. The method to do this
was to ﬁt these data to a power law shape, and
measure the summed square of error (SSE) from
the ﬁtting: in about 50% of the cases, the syn-
thetic sequences had an SSE smaller than that
of the real sequence, indicating that they were
roughly as good power laws as the real data.

We note here that the ratio of the probabil-
ity of observing a synthetic sequence with SSE
similar to that from the real sequence divided
by the probability of observing a synthetic se-
quence with the most probable SSE is around
79%. If we used SSE to measure the goodness of
the power law model for our synthetic data, the
real sequence would be very close to the most
probable synthetic sequence.

We then compared the ﬁt of a power law with
log-periodic oscillations to the real and the syn-
thetic sequences.

The SSE of the synthetic sequences are in the
range [0.005, 0.05], centered around the SSE
from the real sequence (∼ 0.013). There are
around 1/4 of the synthetic sequences that have
a SSE smaller than that from the real sequence.
The ratio of the probability of observing a syn-
thetic sequence with SSE similar to that from
the real sequence and the probability of observ-
ing a synthetic sequence with the most proba-
ble SSE is around 96%. If we use SSE to mea-
sure the regularity of log-periodic oscillations,
the real sequence is thus very close to the most
probable synthetic sequence.

The tf from the synthetic sequences is dis-
tributed in [1988,1995] (Figure 18). The ratio
of the probability of observing a synthetic se-
quence with tf similar to that from the real se-
quence divided by the probability of observing a
synthetic sequence with the most probable tf is

around 95%. Thus the apparent accurate pre-
diction of the actual main-shock time for the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake [Sornette and Sam-
mis, 1995] might be due to chance. The width of
the distribution (FWHM, full width at half max-
imum) is 6.8 years, narrower than that from the
ﬁt of a pure power law (7.8 years), suggesting
that log-periodicity may improve power law ﬁts
by accounting for the most probable noise [Huang
et al., 2000].

There is a well-deﬁned peak in the distribu-
tion of the frequencies of the log-periodic os-
cillations from the ﬁtting of the synthetic se-
quences (Figure 19). The ratio of the proba-
bility of observing a synthetic sequence with fre-
quency similar to that from the real sequence di-
vided by the probability of observing a synthetic
sequence with the most probable frequency is
around 81%.

We summarize the above results in Table 1.
We now turn to the statistics from the char-
acterization of log-periodicity by spectral anal-
ysis of the de-trended data. If we only look at
the distribution of peak heights, the ratio of the
probability observing a synthetic peak similar
to the real peak divided by the probability of
observing the most probable synthetic peak is
around 99.9% (Figure 20).

niﬁcantly change the above results, except that,
for some synthetic sequences, the power law was
not good.

Also, recall that the foregoing results involved
ﬁtting data to a power law with log-periodic os-
cillations, then de-trending. Fitting data to a
pure power law instead produced very similar
results.

We summarize all the results in the previous

sections in Table 2.

5. Discussion

These synthetic tests were performed to de-
termine whether it is possible to observe the re-
ported
log-periodicity [Sornette and Sammis, 1995] from
integrated noise in power laws, and if possible,
how big the probability is. We found that, if we
use the highest peak of the spectrum of the oscil-
lations around the power law of the cumulative
Benioﬀ strain to quantify the log-periodicity in
the oscillations, peaks similar to the peak ob-
served from the real sequence (the real peak)
were indeed frequently observed from the syn-
thetic sequences. The odds of observing a syn-
thetic peak similar to the real peak is more than
50% of the odds of observing the most probable
synthetic peak.

It is reasonable to use the highest peak in the

spectrum of a signal to quantify the most sig-
niﬁcant frequency component in the signal. The
position of the peak is the frequency (ω), and
the peak height (h) quantiﬁes the regularity of
that frequency component. If two signals have
similar peaks in their spectrums, they must have
oscillations of similar frequency and regularity.
Peaks similar to the real peak were observed
frequently from the synthetic sequences. To
quantify this frequency of observation, we con-
structed the probability density function p(ω, h)
of the synthetic peaks in the space of (ω, h).
From p(ω, h), we were able to obtain the prob-
ability of observing a synthetic peak similar to
the real peak (ωr, hr), that is p(ωr, hr) dω dh. This
probability might be a small number, which is
meaningful only when compared with the prob-
ability of observing the most probable synthetic
peak, which is p(ωmp, hmp) dω dh. The ratio of the
two probabilities quantiﬁes well how frequently
we observe the feature from synthetic data.

The mechanism at the origin of log-periodicity
in the synthetic data sets has been discussed in
[Huang, 1999; Huang et al., 2000]. Brieﬂy, log-
periodicity results from the fact that taking the
cumulative of a power law involves a low pass
ﬁltering step (reddening of the noise) which, in
a ﬁnite sample, creates a maximum in the spec-

LOMA PRIETA LOG-PERIODICITY

15

trum leading to a most probable log-frequency
corresponding approximately to 1.5 cycles over
the full sampled interval.

We looked into two quantities for log-periodicity

in the oscillations around the power law of the
cumulative Benioﬀ strain. The extracted oscilla-
tions are the diﬀerence between the data and the
best-ﬁt power law. The de-trended data were
obtained using (6). For both of them, the ra-
tio of the two probabilities is bigger than 50%,
which means that it is not only possible to ob-
serve that kind of log-periodicity in synthetic
data, but also highly probable.

Our synthetic events and the real events have
the same distribution in time and magnitude,
and they were analyzed in exactly the same way.
Since discrete scale invariance is not present in
the synthetic data, the log-periodicity observed
in the real sequence cannot be used as evidence
for discrete scale invariance.

In fact, even the power law–used as evidence
of ordinary scale invariance–could also be ex-
plained by other mechanisms. Indeed, the cu-
mulative Benioﬀ strains of the synthetic se-
quences in Section 4 do follow power laws sim-
ilar to that of the real sequence. For the real
sequence, the cumulative distribution function
of event times is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
a straight line. The cumulative distribution of
moments is not a power law either (S shape in-
stead of the usual power law shape) (this is an
ad hoc statement. The reason is that for this se-
quence of magnitudes, the number of data points
is small (only 30) and the magnitude cut-oﬀ is
very high (5.0). So even if in general the moment
distribution is a power law, large statistical ﬂuc-
tuations may make the moment distribution of
this sequence non power law. We use an em-
pirical distribution function instead of the usual
power law assumption to avoid dependence on
that assumption. In fact our method will still
be valid no matter what the underlying distri-
bution is.). But for the real sequence, mag-
nitudes tends to be bigger when closer to the
main shock, especially for the last several events
[Jones, 1994]. Since small diﬀerence in magni-
tudes will be translated into quite big diﬀerence
in the cumulative Benioﬀ strain, the last several
events would make the would-be linear trend
bend upward which happens to be well described
by a power law of small exponent. Since this in-

creasing tendency of magnitudes was preserved
in the generation of synthetic magnitudes, power
laws are also good for describing the synthetic
data.
In fact, without the re-ordering scheme
to preserve that feature of magnitudes, we were
still able to obtain similar results. As long as the
magnitudes are not exactly uniform, the largest
magnitude will bend the would-be linear trend
somewhere, and power law with small exponents
can still describe the data well.

The improved accuracy of the prediction of
the main shock time of the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake by consideration of log-periodic os-
cillations was regarded as a evidence support-
ing the hypothesis in [Sornette and Sammis, 1995].
However, from the study presented here, it is
not rare to obtain tf near that value from our
synthetic data containing events in the range of
[1940,1988]. If we use a power law to describe
the data, by deﬁnition tf should be slightly big-
ger than the time of the last data point.
In-
deed, from our simulations, we found that tf is
distributed in [1988,1995], and the chance of ob-
serving a synthetic tf similar to the real tf is
around 95% of the probability of observing the
most probable synthetic tf . The point is, given
a sequence of events in that time range and a
power law assumption, that kind of tf is not hard
to ﬁnd.

It is important to emphasize that the present
study does not alter the usefulness of studying
seismic precursors. However, the physical in-
terpretation associated with the observations in
[Sornette and Sammis, 1995] does not seem to be
warranted, at least on the face of the Loma Pri-
eta case only. However, as pointed out in [Huang
et al., 2000] and also found in this paper, log-
periodic oscillations are robust features of power
laws. The present analysis as well as those given
in [Huang et al., 2000] suggests that, whatever
their origin (noise or physical), they might still
be used to improve the prediction of the main
event. This is clearly what we observe in our
synthetic tests performed on pure power laws
without log-periodicity: a power law ﬁt with
log-periodicity has a better estimate for tf than
a pure power law without the log-periodic os-
cillations. The reason may be that, by ﬁtting
the most probable form of noise, the ﬁt is more
stable. It seems worthwhile to investigate this
possibility further in future studies.

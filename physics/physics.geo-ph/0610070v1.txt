1 Abstract

We study the ﬁrst steps of ice formation in fresh water turbulent convection (frazil ice regime).
We explore the sensitivity of the ice formation process to the set of non-dimensional parameters
governing the system. We model the mixture of ice crystals and water as a two-phase medium
composed of water and ice particles of ﬁxed diameter. We use the Boussinesq approximation and
we integrate numerically the set of equations making use of a numerical code based on second
order ﬁnite diﬀerence. A dynamic LES model for the subgrid scales is used.

We show that the ice particle rise velocity and the ice concentration source term coeﬃcient
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the frazil ice dynamics. The maximum of ice production is obtained in those
situations where the rise velocity is of the same order of magnitude of a characteristic velocity
of the thermal downwelling plumes. We develop a simple model which captures the trend of the
growth rate as a function of the relevant parameters. Finally we explore the nonlinear regime
and we show that the parameter which plays a key role in ﬁxing the concentration value at the
statistically steady state is the heat exchange source term coeﬃcient.

Introduction

The ﬁrst stage of ice formation at the supercooled free surface of oceans, rivers and lakes is
called frazil ice, a suspension of individual, small randomly-oriented crystals typically measuring
approximatively 1 ÷ 4 mm in diameter and 1 ÷ 100 µm in thickness [10],[13].

Frazil ice evolves rapidly into a thin slurry of ice platelets giving the sea a greasy or milky
appearance, known as grease ice. As cooling continues and the density of the frazil suspension
increases, the frazil crystals freeze together into small cakes. Collisions between neighbouring cakes
forces frazil ice over the cake edges where rims form to give the characteristic form of pancake,
hence the appellation pancake ice. Initially formed pancakes may be only a few centimeters in
diameter, but they grow in diameter and thickness from surrounding frazil matrix and may reach
3 ÷ 5 m in diameter and 50 ÷ 70 cm in thickness. The last stage of sea ice evolution is the
coalescence of pancake ice ﬂoes, which aggregate into a continuous ice sheet.
In ﬁgure (1) a
picture of a frazil-pancake ice ﬁeld in Polar ocean is reported.

In rivers, frazil ice production is a transient phenomena which occurs in turbulent supercooled
water. The ﬁrst stage is the water temperature lowering to about 0.01 ÷ 0.1 ◦C below the freezing
point because of the wind action or the radiative cooling; then the frazil discs start to form and
the water temperature following the mass of crystals increases in the order of minutes toward the
freezing point. The presence of frazil ice can cause serious problems to hydroelectric facilities such
as the blocking of turbine intakes, the blockage of hydroelectric reservoirs and the freezing open
of gates.

In polar ocean, frazil ice can form under ice covers and in open region within polar pack ice,
more precisely in 100 meters scale leads and in kilometer scale polynyas. Frazil ice is typically
present in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), which is the transition region between the open polar
ocean and the continuous ice that covers the central basin. Due to the combined action of wind

and surface waves, the turbulent waters of MIZ prevent the formation of large ice sheets. The
presence of frazil ice ﬁelds is associated with important geophysical and biological processes of
the polar oceans so that the study of frazil ice dynamics is an active research ﬁeld. As frazil ice
production is accompanied by salt rejection, it is believed that it could play an important role in
stimulating the convection process of ocean waters. Moreover, frazil ice plays an important role
as scouring and sediment transfer agent and also it can transport biological species from the sea
bottom to the surface pack ice.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 3 is devoted to a brief description of the frazil ice
formation process. In section 4 the derivation of the frazil ice transport model is reported, while
section 5 is dedicated to the Boussinesq-like approximation. In section 6 we present numerical
results of the simulations and ﬁnally section 7 is devoted to the conclusions.

3 The formation of frazil ice

The time it takes for ice formation in oceans, rivers and lakes can be quite diﬀerent from one year
to the other, due to meteorological variations. Estimating this time is a very complicated task,
which involves many parameter such as wind, water temperature and water depth. Immediate
applications of this problem can be found in shipping and ice breaking service. To this end,
many theoretical and experimental studies were performed during the last decades, giving useful
information about time histories of temperature and ice formation.

Designers of hydraulics structures such as canals, water transport facilities and hydroelectric
power structures are particularly interested in three ice-ﬂow regimes, which are common in rivers
during freeze-up period: continuous ice sheet, ﬂoating frazil ice and well mixed ﬂow (with frazil
ice crystals vertically mixed in the water ﬂow).
In the last case, if the velocity of the river is
suﬃciently large, open water conditions may persist throughout the winter. In consequence of
this, a very important task is to predict, starting from a given set of ﬂow conditions, which kind
of regime could be expected, and the transition from an ice cover to open water. Obviously, when
frazil ice crystals remain well mixed with the ﬂuid, they cannot accumulate beneath the surface
and the ice cover can not form, so the conditions under which the transition from well mixed
ﬂow to ﬂoating ice layer occurs, could be employed as a rough criteria for the formation of the
continuous ice cover. In [5] the rough criteria cited above was compared, with good agreement,
with experimental and ﬁeld data. In particular, it has been remarked that the presence or absence

2

of the well mixed regime could be forecasted comparing the buoyancy time scale TB with the
vertical turbulent diﬀusive mixing scale TD. When TB < TD a layered ﬂow will develop, because
the frazil ice crystals rise to the water surface faster than they are removed by turbulent mixing.
Under the same argument, the opposite case TB > TD corresponds to a well mixed ﬂow. More
sophisticated criteria take into account other hydrological aspects, such as sinuosity, channel and
slope variability, the transition from frazil ice layer to ice cover throughout pancake ice formation
and the mechanics of interaction between the diﬀerent kinds if ice [5].

In [15] a numerical simulation of ice formation and transport in turbulent ocean water was
performed. The upper ocean was modelled as an Ekman layer, using a k − ǫ turbulence model
for the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. This model was improved in [19]
considering the interaction between frazil ice particles of diﬀerent size. In [9] a model of frazil ice
transport under an ice shelf was proposed and a Boussinesq-like approximation was adopted in the
limiting case of very small ice concentration. In this model the vertical structure was simpliﬁed
by assuming all properties to be constant over the thickness of the plume and discontinuous at its
boundaries; the problem was reduced to one dimension. In [18] the model was extended to the
case of ice particles of diﬀerent size. More recently [17], a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with a
Smagorinsky turbulence model was carried out in order to study frazil ice dynamics and the ice
eﬀects on turbulent structures under polar ice covers and in leads. This work took into account
the eﬀects of salinity. Finally [6] presented results of LES simulations for a turbulent ﬂow with
frazil ice crystals of diﬀerent size.

In our work we propose a parametric study of the problem in the framework of Boussinesq
approximation. In the case of large ice concentrations, the particles interaction at the ice crystal
microscale should be considered. In particular, it was observed that this phenomenon becomes
relevant for ice volume concentrations above .003 [15]. Moreover, the presence of frazil ice crystals
produces an increment in the ice-water mixture eﬀective viscosity. In [3] it was shown that, for
small ice concentrations, this parameter diﬀers from that of pure ﬂuid by a value of the same order
of the concentration itself.

In this paper we have used a convection model for frazil ice transport in turbulent water by
considering the mixture of ice crystals and water as a two-phase medium. The balance equations
for mass, momentum and energy of the ice-water mixture are supplemented by an equation for the
temporal evolution of the ice mass concentration. This equation is strongly coupled to the others.
In particular, the ice particles melting/freezing process and the temperature ﬂuctuations modify
the density of the mixture and thus the buoyancy force, which, in turn, aﬀects the hydrodynamical
behavior.

The simulation of these equations is subject to numerical instability due to large round-oﬀ
errors. In order to avoid this behavior, related to the large magnitude of the coeﬃcient of the
buoyancy term, we have applied a Boussinesq-like approximation to the equations of motion.

A complete model of frazil ice dynamics should be able to represent the complex processes
involved in the ice formation, like growth of ice crystals, ﬂocculation (the clustering of two, or
more, frazil particles), break-up (the cracking of an ice particle) and secondary nucleation (the
production of small ice crystals by the ice fragments scavenging from crystal surface). As a
consequence, a large range of particles size distribution is expected with the crystal diameters
varying from micrometer to millimeter.
In this paper, however, we have considered only one
particle size. This is not a crude simpliﬁcation, because the small ice crystals rapidly evolve into
larger ones and ﬁnally only ice particles within a narrow size range actively aﬀect the system
dynamics [9].

For the sake of simplicity we limit our analysis to ice formation in fresh water and we postpone

studying the eﬀect of salinity to a future work.

We have integrated numerically the evolution equations in the Boussinesq limit using a second
order ﬁnite diﬀerence method. The smallest scales have been modelled within the Large Eddy
Simulation approach: the equations for the resolved scales are obtained introducing a spatial ﬁlter
that removes the unresolved small scales of turbulence; the ﬁltered nonlinear terms are modelled
using the approach of [20]. Numerical simulations have been carried on to determine the sensitivity
of ice growth rate and saturation process to diﬀerent sets of non-dimensional parameters.

4 Model equations for frazil ice transport in turbulent wa-

ter

We model the convective motion in the upper ocean mixed-layer as convection between two parallel
and inﬁnitely long boundaries (albeit periodic), with the upper boundary corresponding to the
air-ocean interface and the lower one corresponding to the mixed layer bottom. The distance
L between the boundaries and the temperature diﬀerence ∆T maintained between them are set
equal, respectively, to a typical depth of the mixed-layer (30÷100 m.) and to a typical temperature
gap between the air-ocean interface and the mixed-layer bottom (0.1 ÷ 0.2 ◦C). The temperature
at the air-ocean interface is set to a value slightly less than the salt water freezing point −2.0 ◦C
corresponding to a typical salinity value S0 = 34.5 psu. Salinity variations play only a small role in
the thermodynamics of the system and we shall hold it constant [6]. Ice concentration is assumed
to be large enough to be represented as a continuum but small enough to neglect the particles
interactions. As a consequence, the system of water and frazil ice particles can be modelled as a
two-component mixture, which is treated as a locally homogeneous ﬂuid with averaged properties.
In the dilute limit that we are considering, the eﬀective viscosity of the ice-water mixture diﬀers
from that of pure ﬂuid by a value of the same order of the concentration itself [3] and this viscosity
increment can be neglected.

We consider a frame of reference such that the z axis is vertically upward. The ice-water

mixture density ρ is given by:

where ρi and φi are, respectively, the ice density and volume fraction; similarly ρw and φw = 1−φi
are, respectively, the water density and volume fraction; ρw is related to the temperature by the
following equation of state:

where ρw0 is the density corresponding to the lower boundary temperature T0 and α is the thermal
expansion coeﬃcient.

The total density ρ can be written as:

ρ = ρiφi + ρwφw,

ρw = ρw0[1 − α(T − T0)],

where ki is the ice molecular diﬀusivity, wr = (0, 0, wr) is the rise velocity that derive from the
balance between the upward net buoyancy force and the drag force. It is still an open question how
to model this velocity; we have left it as a free parameter for sensitivity analysis ([1],[8],[15],[19]).
Here Gi is the source term due to melting and freezing processes and it is given by:

where [7]:

Gi =

λi =

and Li is the ice latent heat of fusion.

It is important to remark that we have used spherical particles instead of disk-like ones which
better represent the frazil ice platelets. The choice is motivated by the great simpliﬁcations
introduced in the model. Moreover the ice particle shape aﬀects the source terms only in their
magnitude; the latter parameters will be used in the foregoing for the sensitivity analysis and they
will vary in a wide range; so we can conclude that the eﬀect of the particle shape on the source
terms is not signiﬁcant for the analysis we are going to carry on.

In order to rewrite eqs. (2-9) in non-dimensional form, we consider the depth of the upper
ocean mixed-layer ¯L = L as length scale, so the depth of the layer is 1, the viscous scale velocity
¯U = ν/ ¯L as velocity scale, the corresponding time ¯t = ¯L/ ¯U = ¯L2/ν as time scale, the water
density ¯ρ = ρw0 as density scale and the temperature gap ∆T between upper and lower boundary
as temperature scale. We indicate by z the dimensionless vertical coordinate with z0 = −1/2 the
lower boundary. We obtain:

5 The Boussinesq approximation for frazil ice transport

model

The buoyancy term in the mean momentum balance equation (13) is multiplied by the factor:

Ra
¯αP r

.

In the cases of physical interest, the Rayleigh number is in excess of 108 ÷ 109 and ¯α ≃ 10−6;
hence this factor can be estimated to have a magnitude of at least 1014 ÷ 1015. As a consequence,
the numerical evaluation of this term in a double precision code is subject to signiﬁcant round-oﬀ
errors: this produces severe numerical instability. In order to avoid this problem we introduce a
Boussinesq-like approximation. We introduce a hydrostatic equilibrium without ice and then we
write down the equations for the small perturbations to this state. The ﬂuctuations are written as a
power series of the small parameter ¯α and the expansion is truncated to lowest order. Temperature
ﬂuctuations, pressure and velocity ﬁeld are of order O(1), whereas density and ice concentration
ﬂuctuations are of order O(¯α). We thus have:

Equations (17-20) are a complete set of equations for the small perturbations to the hydrostatic

names.

6 Numerical results

Equations (17-20) were solved numerically using a fractional step approach [12] with a third
order, three steps, explicit Runge-Kutta scheme. For the spatial discretization, we have employed
a second order accurate ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme on a staggered grid. For the momentum equation,
each Runge-Kutta time step has been splitted into two steps; the ﬁrst one consists in the calculation
of a temporary velocity ﬁeld without making use of the pressure terms; the second step is a
projection of the solution onto a divergence-free space, which results in solving a Poisson equation
for pressure. A fast Poisson solver using Fourier and cycling reduction method was adopted [16].
The eﬀects of the small unresolved scales on the resolved ones are modelled by using the
Subgrid Scale Model proposed by [20]. We utilize the same subgrid scale model for the ﬂux of ice
concentration and for the temperature: the turbulent Schmidt number is computed by using the
dynamic procedure and varies in space and time.

The domain has an extension of 2π in the horizontal directions and height equal to one. The
resolution varies with Rayleigh number: at Ra = 104, 106 and 108 we used respectively 31×31×30,
51 × 51 × 36 and 81 × 81 × 60 collocation points.

6.1 Ice production in deep water

A signiﬁcant amount of oceanic frazil ice might be produced in the deep layers of water. In [13],
for example, it is stated that a large amount of frazil ice in seawater adjacent to shelves could be
produced by freezing of parcels of water rising towards supercooled upper layers. In this series
of simulations, we want to focus on the ice produced in the regions far from the upper layer. To
this end we use the boundary conditions Ci = 0 at z = ±1/2. These conditions amount to cancel
the convective ﬂux of ice through the horizontal boundaries. They produce a very thin boundary
layer immediately beneath the free surface where a non-physical ice concentration drop is present.
T0 + z0, that

In all the subsequent simulations we assume that the freezing temperature is

Ti =

is the upper half of the hydrostatic layer is below freezing point.

Typical curves of the total ice concentration versus time are shown in Fig. 2. In the left ﬁgure,
we clearly distinguish a short transient followed by an exponential growth, ended by the nonlinear
saturation. Evolution of kinetic energy is shown in Fig. 3. The ice seeds are introduced at time
t = 0. We observe that the production of ice is fast compared to the large eddies turnover time.
As a consequence, during the linear phase, the velocity and temperature ﬁelds are almost constant
and we get an almost pure exponential growth of ice concentration. In the right ﬁgure, instead,
the exponential growth phase does not appear very clearly. This is because the time scale for the
ice formation is large compared to the convection turnover time: the ﬂow changes signiﬁcantly
during ice formation. The fast and slow regimes appear very clearly in Fig. 3.

In the fast growth regime, we observe that most of the ice is produced inside the strongest
downwelling plumes. A typical situation is shown in Fig. 4: it is a snapshot of the ﬂow taken during
the linear phase of ice growth. The isovalue for temperature ﬂuctuation has been chosen so that
only the most intense downwelling plume appears (since the ﬂow is periodic in horizontal directions
the four large green structures are actually contiguous). We see that ice (white structures) is
present mostly at the top of that plume. This is natural, since it is also the coldest place inside
the ﬂow: the largest part of ice is produced there, and, since the time scale for the linear phase
is small, the shape of the plume almost does not change and the ice remains conﬁned inside it.
By contrast, in the slow regime, the spots of large ice concentration do not necessarily reside in

the large downwelling plumes. Fig. 5 shows a typical situation where we see small spots of ice
next to the strongest downwelling plumes, and a large spot in a relatively quiescent region in the
ﬂow. The ice still forms mostly inside the coldest downward plumes, but now the process of ice
formation is slow in comparison to the convection time scales and the ice forming has time to
migrate towards quiescent regions. Looking again at Fig. 3, we remark that the total kinetic
energy decreases as soon as a signiﬁcant amount of ice is produced; this happens because most
of the kinetic energy is concentrated in the most intense plumes: the ice that is produced in the
strong downwelling plumes modiﬁes the buoyancy force and tends to slow down the downward
motion; as a consequence, the kinetic energy of those plumes is reduced.

ice concentration (.1Cmax, white). Snapshot taken at a temporal station during the exponential

concentration (.1Cmax, white) for a slow ice formation regime (Ra = 106, γ = 103, wr = 10)

In Figs. 6 and 7 we plot the growth rate for the linear phase as a function respectively of the
rise velocity wr and of the thermal exchange coeﬃcient γ. Each point in the ﬁgures is obtained

9

by carrying on a full simulation until nonlinear saturation of ice concentration occurs. In the fast
regime, the ﬂow is almost frozen during the ice production and the growth is almost exponential;
the growth rate is computed as the slope of ice concentration versus time in log scale (as in Fig. 2
(left)), without considering the initial transient and the ﬁnal nonlinear regime. In the slow regime
the value of the growth rate is determined as the slope of the line which ﬁts at best the curve in
the linear phase, omitting the initial transient.

We notice in Fig. 6 that the growth rate has a maximum at a particular value of the rise

velocity which we denote w. For Ra = 106 it is about w ≃ 75.

Looking at the concentration proﬁles averaged in the horizontal directions (Fig. 8) we can

distinguish three situations according to the value of wr.

In the large rise velocity regime (wr > w), the ice crystals are rapidly pushed upward and they
cannot act as nuclei for ice formation; therefore the ice rate of growth decreases when rise velocity
increases and most of the ice concentration is found near the top. If wr ∼ w, the rise velocity is
balanced by the downwelling velocity of the plumes in the upper layer of the domain, where the
temperature is the lowest. Crystals remain conﬁned in this region and their concentration grows
rapidly. Finally if wr < w the ice is transported down and exits the plumes where it was created.
The ice spreads throughout the domain and the average concentration proﬁle is almost ﬂat (Fig.
8).

Note that the proﬁles observed by ([21]) beneath lead in the Beaufort Sea (north of Alaska) and
those obtained by ([17]) from the numerical simulations of lead dynamics show a large presence
of ice near the top of the layer; this is in agreement with the situation where wr & w.

6.2 A 1D model for fast ice formation

We propose in this subsection a simple model that explains the behavior of the curves shown in
Figs. 6 and 7 for the fast regime. We start from (20) and assume that inside the intense vertical
plumes we can neglect horizontal velocities and horizontal derivatives. Therefore Ci is a function
of z and t and we get:

The degenerate case is the one with the largest growth rate and it is therefore the most
interesting. In Figs. 10 and 11 we plot the growth rate ω versus respectively wr and Γ together
with the actual values obtained by the LES simulations. The values of W , Γ and S are expressed
by (22) and depend on typical values of vertical velocity w, temperature T and turbulent Schmidt
number Scturb. Those values could be predicted by turbulent convection theories but we decide
here to choose the values which ﬁt at best the LES curve. As we see in Fig. 10, the ﬁt is very

good for rise velocities greater or equal to w. The bad behaviour at smaller values is due to the
fact that thei ice does not stay conﬁned inside downwelling plumes and therefore the hypotheis of
our model is not veriﬁed. In order to get a more quantitative agreement, we reﬁne the model by
dropping the assumption that W and Γ are constant. We compute the actual vertical proﬁle of
these functions by averaging the values obtained by the LES simulations inside the most intense
downwelling plume (see Figs. 9).

where A and B are (N + 1) × (N + 1) matrices. A method to solve such problem is to use
the QZ algorithm. Such algorithm gives the full spectrum of eigenvalues/eigenvectors. Another
method is to use iterative techniques (Krylov based methods), such as the Arnoldi method or the
unsymmetric Lanczos method [2]. This method gives few eigenvalues corresponding to the least
stable part of the spectrum. For our problem we have implemented both the QZ and the Arnoldi
method and we have checked that the results produced by both techniques are always similar.

The growth rates obtained by solving (25) with the vertical proﬁles of the two most intense
downwelling plumes and those given by the constant coeﬃcient model (24) are shown in Figs.
10 and 11. From Fig. 10 we observe that when the rise velocity is far from the peak value w,
the growth rate predicted by our model underestimates the actual value (this occurs for about

12

wr > 300 and wr < 75). The reason is that when the growth rate is small the ﬂow cannot be
considered steady during the exponential ice growth, but rather it ﬂuctuates.

Figures 12 and 13 are similar to Figs. 10 and 11, except for the Rayleigh number that is 108
instead of 106. We see that the results obtained at Ra = 106 are still valid, thus they are robust
and we can hope to extrapolate them to even larger Rayleigh numbers that are of interest for
geophysical applications.

Some analytical progress far from the fast regime is possible provided wr is not too small (so
to be able to balance the downwelling in the plumes). In this way, the permanence time τp of an
ice crystal in a plume can be considered long and the growth process will be dominated by the
plumes with the largest growth rate: hexp(Γτp)i ∼ exp(ΓMAXτp). Taking at the same time the limit
Γτ ≪ 1 with τ the typical plume circulation time, allows to treat the velocity and temperature
ﬂuctuations as a noise and to calculate averages in closed form.

Let us look at a single Lagrangian parcel, moving with velocity w(z(t), t) + wr (plus the eﬀect

of molecular diﬀusion) and endowed with an ice concentration c(t) obeying:

dc(t)
dt

= γ[Ti − T (z(t), t)]c(t).

Identify with tilde and overbar, the ﬂuctuating and mean ﬁeld component of w and T at the parcel
position z: w(z, t) = ¯w(z, t) + ˜w(t); T (z, t) = ¯T (z, t) + ˜T (t) In the limit τ → 0, the equations for
z(t) and c(t) can be written in the form:

dz = [wr + ¯w(z, t)]dt + σ ˜wτ 1/2dB1 + (2/Sc)1/2dB2,
dc = γ[Ti − ¯T (z, t)]c dt + γσ ˜T τ 1/2c d(S)B3,

(cid:26)

where the dBi are Brownian increments, that, for simplicity, we take as independent: hdBii = 0,
hdBidBji = δijdt. The superscript in d(S)B3 indicates Stratonovich prescription [4], and arises

This leads to a correction to the mean growth rate, and the second of eq. (6.2) will take the form,

Neglecting this eﬀect, as shown in Fig. 10, leads to underestimating the actual growth rate.

eq. (28) does.

Notice that Eq. (21) would be recovered from (27) (as it should) if no ﬂuctuating component

were singled out of the w and T ﬁelds.

6.3 Non linear phase

The nonlinear saturation occurs when the ice concentration (rescaled by the factor α, see (20))
reaches values of the order of unity: the density of the mixture varies by amounts of order α and
the buoyancy force in (18) is signiﬁcantly aﬀected. One must bear in mind that the Boussinesq
approximation breaks down when ice concentration exceeds values of order unity; therefore results
of the nonlinear stage must be taken with caution: they give qualitative indications but they
cannot be used to assert quantitative conclusions.

In Fig. 14 we plot the temporal evolution of total ice concentration for three simulations with
diﬀerent values of β. The linear stage is insensitive to the value of β because the ice concentration
is too low to produce any change in temperature ﬂuctuations. However we see that the nonlinear
saturation is aﬀected by the value of β and the general trend is that for larger values of β the ice
saturation levels tend to decrease.

In Fig. 15 we see that the presence of ice inhibits convection.
In Fig. 16 we plot the average vertical temperature proﬁles during the nonlinear stage. We
see that temperature tends to increase when β decreases. Lower values of β correspond to larger
values of ice concentration, as we saw in Fig. 14. Therefore when total ice concentration increases
the temperature of the ﬂow tends to increase. This can be explained by the fact that during the
phase transition in the freezing process there is an emission of heat. Therefore more ice production
corresponds to more heat in the ﬂow and the average temperature tends to increase.

6.4 Free surface ﬂow

In subsection 6.1 we were interested in the ice produced in the regions far from the upper layer,
and therefore we adopted the simple boundary condition Ci = 0 for the ice concentration at the
surface.

In this subsection we want to study if and how the upper boundary conditions aﬀect the ice
concentration proﬁle and growth. There is still no general consensus on how to obtain no upward
ice ﬂux at the air-water interface. Some authors ([15], [14] and [19]) impose Neumann condition
∂Ci/∂z = hc, with hc 6= 0, in order to represent the seeding eﬀect due to the mass exchange
with the atmosphere. It is still not clear, however, how to model the ﬂux hc. Other authors [17]
propose to account for the ice crystals escaping across the air-water interface by accumulating

the water surface, therefore the water surface is a free surface, and we neglect the seeding eﬀect.
The suitable boundary conditions for this situation are free slip conditions for velocity and total

In Fig. 18 we plot the vertical proﬁle of ice concentration averaged over horizontal directions;
we also plot the one obtained using the boundary conditions of subsection 6.1. We see that the two
curves diﬀer signiﬁcantly near the surface, where the new boundary conditions produce a peak of
ice concentration. Far from the upper boundary however the two proﬁles look very similar. In Fig.
17 we present a snapshot taken during the linear phase of the large downwelling plumes and of the
ice concentration. Comparison with Fig. 4 conﬁrms that the main diﬀerence is the accumulation
of ice near the water surface.

Figure 17: Isosurface of negative temperature ﬂuctuations (-0.2, green) and isosurfaces of large
ice concentration (.1Cmax, white). Snapshot taken at a temporal station during the exponential
growth regime for a fast ice formation regime (Ra = 106, γ = 104, wr = 150).

We compare next the growth rate of ice concentration for the new and old boundary conditions:
in Fig. 19 we present the growth rate of ice concentration as a function of the rise velocity wr.
We observe that the two curves are similar. When the rise velocity wr is small, we observe that
the growth rate using the new boundary conditions is larger. This can be explained by the fact
that these boundary conditions allow production of ice near the surface.

We can thus conclude that the new boundary conditions only aﬀect the ice produced at the
top of the layer, but they do not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the overall ice production rate and the ice
concentration proﬁle in the deep layers.

7 Conclusions

In this paper we have explored the sensitivity of the ice formation process to a set of non-
dimensional parameters: the ice melting/freezing source term γ, the ratio between the latter
and the temperature source term β, and the ice particle rise velocity
wr. Regarding the Rayleigh
number Ra, we have considered moderately turbulent regimes up to Ra = 108.

We have modeled the mixture of ice crystals and water as a two-phase medium composed of
water and ice particles of ﬁxed diameter. The equations describing the system are the classical
balance equations for mass, momentum and energy in the ice-water mixture, supplemented by an
advection-diﬀusion equation for the ice mass concentration with an additional source term, which
account for the net ice production during melting or freezing process. In order to account for
the net heat exchange during the same process, an additional source term has been introduced
in the temperature equation. The simulation of the complete equations, however, is subject to
numerical instability due to large round-oﬀ errors. The origin of such error is the factor Ra/ ¯α
(¯α is the coeﬃcient of thermal expansion) in the buoyancy term, which, for values of Ra of
interest (Ra ≥ 108), is larger than 1014. Therefore, we have developed and applied the Boussinesq
approximation and we have integrated numerically the set of equations making use of a numerical
code based on second order ﬁnite diﬀerence. A dynamic LES model has been used in order to
cope with the subgrid scales that are not considered in the simulations.

The sensitivity analysis has shown that the ice particle rise velocity and the ice concentration

regime, the ice crystals are rapidly pushed upward and they cannot act as nuclei for ice formation;
in the opposite regime of small rise velocity they tend to be transported downwards in warmer
regions where they tend to melt down. The maximum of ice production is obtained in those
situations where the rise velocity is of the same order of magnitude of the peak rise velocity w.
We have developed a simple model which captures the trend of the growth rate as a function of the
relevant parameters. The model has been derived in the approximation where the ice is produced
far beneath the water surface, however it is found to be valid also for free surface ﬂow.

The parameter which plays a key role in ﬁxing the concentration value at the statistically
steady state is the heat exchange source term coeﬃcient β. The greater is β, the lower is the
domain averaged ice concentration. Moreover, the presence of more frazil ice crystals induces a
rapid fall in the kinetic energy and this energy lowering increases as the saturated ice concentration
increases.

The Boussinesq approximation holds only when frazil ice mass concentration is very small,
i.e. of the same order of the small non-dimensional parameter ¯α = α∆T . So, the Boussinesq
approximation represents well the initial stage of ice formation, but it breaks down when the
ice concentration becomes signiﬁcant. Moreover, at signiﬁcant ice concentrations, the particles
interaction and the eﬀective viscosity increment due to the presence of the ice particles should be
taken into account [3].

Other eﬀects that were not included in the present study and which we postpone for the future
are: the inclusion of salinity, the occurrence of diﬀerent classes of ice crystals with diﬀerent size,
the eﬀect of diﬀerent conditions at the top of the layer, for example a horizontal wind blowing
over the water, or the presence of an ice shelf.

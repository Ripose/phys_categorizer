Abstract

We consider a general stochastic branching process, which is relevant to earthquakes, and study the

distributions of global lifetimes of the branching processes. In the earthquake context, this amounts to the

distribution of the total durations of aftershock sequences including aftershocks of arbitrary generation

numbers. Our results extend previous results on the distribution of the total number of oﬀsprings (direct

and indirect aftershocks in seismicity) and of the total number of generations before extinction. We

consider a branching model of triggered seismicity, the ETAS (epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model

which assumes that each earthquake can trigger other earthquakes (“aftershocks”). An aftershock sequence

results in this model from the cascade of aftershocks of each past earthquake. Due to the large ﬂuctuations

of the number of aftershocks triggered directly by any earthquake (“productivity” or “fertility”), there

is a large variability of the total number of aftershocks from one sequence to another, for the same

mainshock magnitude. We study the regime where the distribution of fertilities µ is characterized by a

power law

INTRODUCTION

We study the distribution of the total duration of an aftershock sequence, for a class of branch-

ing processes [1, 2] appropriate in particular for modeling earthquake aftershock sequences. The

noteworthy particularity and challenging property of this class of branching processes is that the

variance of the number of progenies in direct lineage from the mother is mathematically inﬁ-

nite. In addition, a long-time (power law) memory of the impact of a mother on triggering her

ﬁrst-generation daughters gives rise to subdiﬀusion [3, 4] and non-mean ﬁeld behavior in the dis-

tributions of the total number of aftershocks per mainshock and of the total number of generations

before extinctions [5]. Here, we add on these previous works but showing that the distribution of

the total duration of an aftershock sequence is extremely long-tailed: the very heavy-tailed nature

of the distribution of the durations of aftershock sequences predicted by this simple model may

explain the large variability of the lifetimes of observed aftershock sequences and is compatible

with the observation that felt aftershocks of the great Mino-Owari (1891) Japanese earthquake,

that inspired Omori’s statistical rate model, have persisted at a rate consistent with the Omori law

for 100 years [6].

Our results may also be of interest to other systems which are characterized by branching pro-

cesses with a broad power-law distribution of fertilities, such as epidemic transmission of diseases,

and more generally transmission processes involving avalanches spreading on networks such as the

World Wide Web, cellular metabolic network, ecological food webs, social networks and so on,

as a consequence of the well-documented power law distribution of connectivities among nodes.

Our results are thus relevant to systems in which the number of oﬀsprings may be large due to

long-range interactions, long-memory eﬀects or large deviation processes.

II. THE EPIDEMIC-TYPE AFTERSHOCK SEQUENCE (ETAS) BRANCHING

MODEL OF EARTHQUAKES WITH LONG MEMORY

We consider a general branching process in which each progenitor or mother (mainshock) is

characterized by its conditional average number

Nm ≡

κµ(m)

3

(1)

of children (triggered events or aftershocks of ﬁrst generation), where

µ(m) = 10α(m−m0) ,

is a mark associated with an earthquake of magnitude m

m0 (in the language of “marked point

≥

processes”), κ is a constant factor and m0 is the minimum magnitude of earthquakes capable

of triggering other earthquakes. The meaning of the term “conditional average” for Nm is the

following: for a given earthquake of magnitude m and therefore of mark µ(m), the number r of its

daughters of ﬁrst generation are drawn at random according to the Poissonian statistics

pµ(r) =

e−Nm =

N r
m
r!

(κµ)r
r!

e−κµ .

Thus, Nm is the expectation of the number of daughters of ﬁrst generation, conditioned on a

ﬁxed magnitude m and mark µ(m). The expression (2) for µ(m) is chosen in such a way that it

reproduces the empirical dependence of the average number of aftershocks triggered directly by

an earthquake of magnitude m (see [7] and references therein). Expression (1) with (2) gives the

so-called productivity law of a given mother as a function of its magnitude.

In addition, we use the well-known Gutenberg-Richter (GR) density distribution of earthquake

magnitudes

p(m) = b ln(10) 10−b(m−m0) , m

m0 ,

≥

such that

∞
m p(x)dx gives the probability that an earthquake has a magnitude equal to or larger
than m. This magnitude distribution p(m) is assumed to be independent on the magnitude of the

R

triggering earthquake, i.e., a large earthquake can be triggered by a smaller one [7, 8].

Combining (4) and (2), we see that the earthquake marks µ and therefore the conditional average

number Nm of daughters of ﬁrst generation are distributed according to a power law

terminology of branching processes, n is called the branching ratio. For n < 1, there are on average

less than one child per mother: this corresponds to transient (sub-critical) branching processes with

ﬁnite lifetimes with probability one. For n > 1, there are more than one child per mother: this

corresponds to explosive (super-critical) branching processes with a number of events growing

exponentially with time. The value n = 1 of exactly one child per mother on average is the critical

point separating the two regimes.

Finally, we assume that a given event (the “mother”) of magnitude m

which a mother triggers daughters which then trigger their own daughters and so on, the direct

III. GENERAL FORMALISM IN TERM OF GENERATING FUNCTIONS

Since we are interested in characterizing the distribution of the random times at which an

aftershock sequence triggered by a given mainshock terminates, we take the time of the mainshock

of magnitude m at the origin t = 0 and we do not consider the eﬀect of earlier earthquakes.

This is warranted by the fact that sequences of earthquakes generated by diﬀerent mainshocks are

independent in the ETAS branching model.

A. First generation aftershocks

Let us ﬁrst discuss some more detailed statistical description of ﬁrst generation aftershocks.

Each aftershock arising independently from another preceding aftershock itself born at the random

0 Φ(t′) dt′. Here and everywhere below,
the dimensionless time t/c is used and we replace t by t/c, with the understanding that t or τ

means t/c when needed. It is convenient to introduce the complementary CDF of ﬁrst generation

aftershocks

a(t) = 1

b(t) =

−

1
(t + 1)θ .

Let us consider a mainshock with mark µ that triggers exactly r aftershocks of ﬁrst-generation

arising at the moments (t1, t2, . . . , tr). Then, the CDF of the time T (µ

r) of the last arising

Pµ(t

{

< t) = [b(t)]r .

Averaging this CDF over the random ﬁrst-generation aftershock numbers r at ﬁxed µ weighted

by their probability pµ(r) given by (3) yields the CDF Pµ(t) for the total duration T (µ) of the

ﬁrst-generation aftershocks

Pµ(t) = Pr (T (µ) < t) = Gµ[b(t)] .

Here, Gµ(z) =

∞
r=0 pµ(r)zr is the generating probability function (GPF) of the number of ﬁrst-

generation aftershocks. For the Poissonian statistics (3), it is equal to

P

This leads to the well-known relation

In the ETAS model, the Gutenberg-Richter distribution (4) of magnitudes together with the

productivity law (2) implies the power law (5) for the marks µ. Averaging over all possible main-

shock magnitude thus amounts to averaging (10) over all possible µ’s. The CDF of durations T of

In the ETAS model, any event (the initial mother or any aftershock, whatever its generation

number) triggers its aftershocks of ﬁrst-generation in a statistically independent and equivalent

manner, according to the laws given in section II. This gives the possibility of obtaining closed

equations for the CDF of the total duration of aftershocks triggering processes.

sequence of aftershocks generated by this pointed out ﬁrst-generation aftershock is

of the durations of aftershocks sequences, resulting from cascades of triggered events.

In order to exploit equation (21), we ﬁrst need to express Q(t) as a function of R(t). For this,

V. EXACTLY SOLUBLE CASE: PURE EXPONENTIAL OMORI LAW

Before addressing the case of interest of earthquakes where the direct Omori law Φ(t) is a power

law with exponent 0 < θ < 1, it is instructive to present the solution for the case where Φ(t) is an

exponential. In this case, an exact solution can be obtained in close form. This exact solution will

10

be useful to check the quasistatic and dynamical linearization approximations developed below to

solve the diﬃcult case where Φ(t) is a power law with exponent 0 < θ < 1.

Note that, in the subcritical case n < 1, there is a crossover from the power law (46) at early

times which is characteristic of the critical regime n = 1, to an exponential decay at long times of

daughter aftershocks from mother earthquakes. This gives rise to a renormalization of the exponent

θ into a smaller exponent θ/γ (for 1 < γ < 2).

C. PDF of the total duration of aftershocks branching processes

The previous sections have discussed in details how to obtain the complementary CDF R of

the total duration of aftershock branching processes, corresponding to some ﬁrst generation after-

14

shock, triggered by a main earthquake. The CDF Pµ of the total duration of aftershock triggering

processes, taking into account all aftershocks triggered by a main earthquake of ﬁxed magnitude, is

described by relation (18). The corresponding PDF of the total duration of an aftershock sequence

is thus equal to

If µκ

1 (as is the case for a large earthquake which has a large average productivity), then, due

to the exponential factor in (67), this PDF diﬀers signiﬁcantly from zero only if R is very small.

Then using the expression for small values of R described by the quasistatic approximation (63),

Wµ(τ ) =

Expression (68) is our main result. Fig. 4 shows a log-log plot of the PDF (68) for diﬀerent values

of the mainshock size µκ for γ = 1.25 and θ = 0.2 (Recall that β is given by (16) and we put it

equal to 1 to draw Fig. 4).

Expression (68) shows that the power law tail holds for durations t/c > tµ/c

10(αγ/θ)m for which the exponential factor goes to 1. Thus, for θ small (

be relevant for earthquakes), expression (68) exhibits a very strong dependence on the mainshock

magnitude through its impact (2) on the mark µ. Therefore, the most relevant part of the distribu-
tion of the durations for small mainshocks is controlled by the power law tail τ −1−θ/γ. In contrast,

the observable part of the distribution of durations for very large mainshocks is controlled by the

exponential term which, together with the power law prefactor, leads to a maximum: for very large

µ, Wµ(τ ) starts from zero for τ = 0 and then increase up to a maximum before crossing over slowly
to the power law tail τ −1−θ/γ, as illustrated in Fig. 4.

D. Crossover from critical to subcritical regime

The asymptotics of the complementary CDF R satisﬁes the equation (62) in the quasistatic

approximation. In the subcritical regime, using the polynomial approximation (23), one can rewrite

equation (62) in the form

n)R + βRγ = τ −θ .

It is seen from this equality that if R > Rc, where

then one can neglect the linear term in the left-hand-side of equality (69) and obtain the power

law (63), typical of the critical regime n = 1. In contrast, if R < Rc, then the subcritical scenario

of the complementary CDF R dominates and equality (69) gives the subcritical power law

It follows from (69) and (70) that the time of the crossover from the critical to the subcritical

regime is equal to

Abstract

We study the multifractal temporal scaling properties of river discharge and precip-
itation records. We compare the results for the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis method with the results for the wavelet transform modulus maxima tech-
nique and obtain agreement within the error margins. In contrast to previous stud-
ies, we ﬁnd non-universal behaviour: On long time scales, above a crossover time
scale of several months, the runoﬀ records are described by ﬂuctuation exponents
varying from river to river in a wide range. Similar variations are observed for the
precipitation records which exhibit weaker, but still signiﬁcant multifractality. For
all runoﬀ records the type of multifractality is consistent with a modiﬁed version of
the binomial multifractal model, while several precipitation records seem to require
diﬀerent models.

The analysis of river ﬂows has a long history. Already more than half a cen-
tury ago the engineer H. E. Hurst found that runoﬀ records from various
rivers exhibit ’long-range statistical dependencies’ [1]. Later, such long-term
correlated ﬂuctuation behaviour has also been reported for many other geo-
physical records including precipitation data [2,3], see also [4]. These original
approaches exclusively focused on the absolute values or the variances of the
full distribution of the ﬂuctuations, which can be regarded as the ﬁrst mo-
ment F1(s) [1–3] and the second moment F2(s) [5], respectively. In the last

decade it has been realized that a multifractal description is required for a full
characterization of the runoﬀ records [6,7]. Accordingly, one has to consider
all moments Fq(s) to fully characterize the records. This multifractal descrip-
tion of the records can be regarded as a ’ﬁngerprint’ for each station or river,
which, among other things, can serve as an eﬃcient non-trivial test bed for
the state-of-the-art precipitation-runoﬀ models.

Since a multifractal analysis is not an easy task, especially if the data are
aﬀected by trends or other non-stationarities, e.g. due to a modiﬁcation of
the river bed by construction work or due to changing climate, it is useful to
compare the results for diﬀerent methods. We have studied the multifractality
by using the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method
[8] (see also [9,10]) and the well established wavelet transform modulus max-
ima (WTMM) technique [11,12] and ﬁnd that both methods yield equivalent
results. Both approaches diﬀer from the multifractal approach introduced into
hydrology by Lovejoy and Schertzer [6,7].

We analyze long daily runoﬀ records {Wi} from six international hydrological
stations and long daily precipitation records {Pi} from six international me-
teorological stations. The stations are representative for diﬀerent rivers and
diﬀerent climate zones, as we showed in larger separate studies [13,14]. As
a representative example, Fig. 1 shows three years of the runoﬀ record of
the river Danube (a) and of the precipitation recorded in Vienna (b). It can
be seen that the precipitation record appears more random than the runoﬀ
record. To eliminate the periodic seasonal trend, we concentrate on the depar-
tures φi = Wi − W i (and φi = Pi − P i) from the mean daily runoﬀ W i. W i
is calculated for each calendar date i, e.g. 1st of April, by averaging over all
years in the record.

In the MF-DFA procedure [8], the moments Fq(s) are calculated by (i) in-

The slopes h(q) for large s of both, the MF-DFA curves and the rescaled WTMM
curves are equivalent.

calculating the mean-square deviations F 2(ν, s) from polynomial ﬁts in each

root. In the paper, we have used third order polynomials in the ﬁtting pro-
cedure of step (iii) (MF-DFA3), this way eliminating quadratic trends in the
data. We consider both, positive and negative moments Fq(s) (q ranges from
−10 to +10) and determine them for time scales s between s = 5 and s = N/5,
where N is the length of the series. Figure 2 shows the results (ﬁlled symbols)
for two representative hydrological stations. On large time scales, above a
crossover occurring around 30-200 days, we observe a power-law scaling be-
haviour,

Fq(s) ∼ sh(q),

(1)

where the scaling exponent h(q) (the slope in Fig. 2) explicitly depends on the
value of q. This behaviour represents the presence of multifractality.

In order to test the MF-DFA approach we have applied the well-established
WTMM technique, which is also detrending but based on wavelet analysis
instead of polynomial ﬁtting procedures. For a full description of the method,
we refer to [11,12]. First, the wavelet-transform T (n, s′) = 1
i=1 φi g[(i −
n)/s′] of the departures φi is calculated. For the wavelet g(x) we choose the
third derivative of a Gaussian here, g(x) = d3(e−x2/2)/dx3, which is orthogonal
to quadratic trends. Now, for a given scale s′, one determines the positions
ni of the local maxima of |T (n, s′)|, so that |T (ni − 1, s′)| < |T (ni, s′)| ≥

(c) Susquehanna in Harrisburg, USA, (d) Wertach in Biessenhofen, Germany, (e)
Danube in Orsova, Romania, and (f) Niger in Koulikoro, Mali. The h(q) values have
been determined by straight line ﬁts of Fq(s) on large time scales. The error bars of
the ﬁts correspond to the size of the symbols. The lines are obtained by ﬁts of the
two-parameter binomial model yielding Eq. (3). The resulting model parameters a
and b are reported in the ﬁgures. All ﬁts are consistent with the data within the
error bars (from [13]).

|T (ni+1, s′)|. Then, one obtains the WTMM partition sum Zq(s′) by averaging
|T (ni, s′)|q for all maxima ni. An additional supremum procedure has to be
used in the WTMM method in order to keep the dependence of Z(q, s′) on s′
monotonous [12]. The expected scaling behaviour is Z(q, s′) ∼ (s′)τ (q), where
τ (q) are the Renyi exponents. Since τ (q) is related to the exponents h(q) by
h(q) = [τ (q) + 1]/q [8] we have plotted

[sZ(q, s/8)]1/q ∼ s[τ (q)+1]/q ∼ sh(q).

We set s′ = s/8 in the comparison with the MF-DFA results, since the wavelet
we employ can be well approximated within a window of size 8s′ (i.e. within
4 standard deviations on both sides), and this window size corresponds to the
segment length s in the MF-DFA. Figure 2 shows that both methods yield
equivalent results for the q values we considered.

Using the MF-DFA results, we have determined h(q) from Eq. (1) for all
runoﬀ records and all precipitation records and for several values of q. Since
a crossover occurs in Fq(s) for time scales in the range of 30-200 days, we

considered only suﬃciently long time scales (above one year), where the results
scale well. Figure 3 shows h(q) for the runoﬀ data, while Fig. 4 shows h(q)
for the precipitation data. Together with the results we show least-square ﬁts
according to the formula

h(q) =

(3)

which corresponds to τ (q) = − ln[aq + bq]/ ln 2 and can be obtained from a
generalized binomial multifractal model [13], see also [4,8]. The values of the
two parameters a and b are also reported in the ﬁgures. The results for all
rivers can be ﬁtted surprisingly well with only these two parameters (see Fig.
3). Instead of choosing a and b, we could also choose the Hurst exponent h(1)
and the persistence exponent h(2). From knowledge of two moments, all the
other moments follow.

This surprising result does not hold for the precipitation records. As can be
seen in Figs. 4(c) and 4(f) there are stations where Eq. (3) cannot describe
the multifractal scaling behaviour reasonably well. According to Rybski et al.,
Eq. (3) is appropriate only for about 50 percent of the precipitation records
[14].

In the generalized binomial multifractal model, the strength of multifractal-
ity is described by the diﬀerence of the asymptotical values of h(q), ∆α ≡
h(−∞) − h(∞) = (ln b − ln a)/ ln 2. We note that this parameter is identical
to the width of the singularity spectrum f (α) at f = 0. Studying 41 river
runoﬀ records [13], we have obtained an average ∆α = 0.49 ± 0.16, which
indicates rather strong multifractality on the long time scales considered. For
the precipitation records, on the other hand, the multifractality is weaker. The
average is ∆α = 0.29 ± 0.14 for 83 records [14].

Our results for h(q) may be compared with the diﬀerent ansatz h(q) = 1+H ′−
C1(qα′−1 − 1)/(α′ − 1) with the three parameters H ′, C1, and α′ (LS ansatz),
that has been used by Lovejoy, Schertzer, and coworkers [6,7] successfully to
describe the multifractal behaviour of rainfall and runoﬀ records for q > 0.
A quantitative comparison between both methods is inhibited, since here we
considered only long time scales and used detrending methods. We like to note
that formula (3) for h(q) is not only valid for positive q values, but also for
negative q values. We ﬁnd it remarkable, that for the runoﬀ records only two
parameters were needed to ﬁt the data. For the precipitation data, one needs
either three parameters like in the LS ansatz or diﬀerent schemes.

In summary, we have analyzed long river discharge records and long precipita-
tion records using the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (MF-DFA)
and the wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method. We obtained
agreement within the error margins and found that the runoﬀ records are
characterized by stronger multifractality than the precipitation records. Sur-
prisingly, the type of multifractality occurring in all runoﬀ records is consistent
with a modiﬁed version of the binomial multifractal model, which supports
the idea of a ’universal’ multifractal behaviour of river runoﬀs suggested by
Lovejoy and Schertzer. In contrast, according to [14], several precipitation
records seem to require a diﬀerent description or a three-parameter ﬁt like the
LS ansatz. The multifractal exponents can be regarded as ’ﬁngerprints’ for
each station. Furthermore, a multifractal generator based on the modiﬁed bi-
nomial multifractal model can be used to generate surrogate data with speciﬁc
properties for each runoﬀ record and for some of the precipitation records.

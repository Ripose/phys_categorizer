Abstract

We study the statistics of the recurrence times between earthquakes above a cer-
tain magnitude M in California. We ﬁnd that the distribution of the recurrence
times strongly depends on the previous recurrence time τ0. As a consequence, the
conditional mean recurrence time ˆτ (τ0) between two events increases monotonically
with τ0. For τ0 well below the average recurrence time τ , ˆτ (τ0) is smaller than τ ,
while for τ0 > τ , ˆτ (τ0) is greater than τ . Also the mean residual time until the next
earthquake does not depend only on the elapsed time, but also strongly on τ0. The
larger τ0 is, the larger is the mean residual time. The above features should be taken
into account in any earthquake prognosis.

Recently, Corral [1, 2] studied the recurrence of earthquakes above a certain
magnitude threshold M in spatial areas delimited by a window of L degrees
in longitude and L degrees in latitude. He found that the distribution D(τ ) of
recurrence times τ scales with the mean recurrence time τ as

D(τ ) =

f (τ /τ ),

1
τ

where the function f (Θ) is quite universal and independent of M. For Θ below
1, f can be approximated by a power-law, while for Θ ≫ 1, f (Θ) decays
exponentially with Θ. As a consequence of the deviation from a Poissonian
decay [3], the mean residual time to the next event increases with the elapsed
time [1, 2].

In this paper, we study the statistics of the recurrence intervals of the Cali-
fornia database [4] and ﬁnd that both quantities, the recurrence interval dis-
tribution D(τ ) and the mean residual time to the next earthquake strongly
depend on the previous recurrence time interval τ0.

We study the records from the local Californian earthquake catalog [4] for the
period 1981-2003 in the area 30.5-38.5N latitude, 114-122W longitude, with
minimal magnitude threshold value M = 2 and minimal recurrence times 2
mins [5]. Similarly to Corral [1], we consider the earthquakes in the region
that are above a certain threshold M, as a linear process in time {ti} without
taking into account the spatial coordinates of the event hypocenters. We are
interested in the recurrence intervals τi = ti − ti−1 between these earthquakes.

In records without memory, the (conditional) distribution D(τ |τ0) of recur-
rence intervals τ that directly follow a certain interval τ0, does not depend on
the value of τ0 and is identical to D(τ ). In contrast, in records with long-term
memory, there is a pronounced dependence of D(τ |τ0) on τ0 [7,8]. To study
possible memory eﬀects in the earthquake records with a reliable statistics, we
have studied the conditional distribution D(τ |τ0) not for a speciﬁc τ0 value,
but for values of τ0 in certain intervals. To this end, we have sorted the record
of N recurrence intervals in increasing order and divided it into four subrecords
Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4, such that each subrecord contains one quarter of the to-
tal number of recurrence intervals. By deﬁnition, the N/4 lowest recurrence
intervals are in Q1, while the N/4 largest intervals are in Q4.

Figure 1 shows D(τ |τ0) for τ0 averaged over Q1 and Q4. For comparison, we also
show the unconditional distribution function D(τ ). To improve the statistics,
we used logarithmic binning. We considered time scales from 2 minutes to
10τ , with 50 log-bins, counted the number of recurrence intervals within each
bin and divided it by the size of the bin. To further improve the statistics, we
averaged the probability distribution over threshold values M = 2.25 . . . 2.75
around M ≃ 2.5. Finally, we normalized the probability distribution to obtain
the probability densities of interest. The ﬁgure shows that for τ well below
its mean value τ , the probability of ﬁnding τ below (above) τ is enhanced
(decreased) compared with D(τ ) for τ0 in Q1, while the opposite occurs for τ0
in Q4.

By deﬁnition, ˆτ (τ0) is the mean recurrence intervals, when the two events
before were separated by an interval τ0. The memory eﬀect in the conditional
distribution function D(τ |τ0) leads to an explicit dependence of ˆτ (τ0) on τ0. To
calculate ˆτ (τ0), we divided the sorted (in increasing order) record of recurrence
intervals into 8 consecutive octaves. Each octave contains N/8 intervals. In
each interval, we calculate the mean value. We studied ˆτ as a function of τ0/τ ,
where now τ0 denotes the mean recurrence time in the octave. Figure 2 shows
ˆτ (τ0)/τ as a function of τ0/τ and clearly demonstrates the strong eﬀect of the
memory. Small and large recurrence intervals are more likely to be followed
by small and large ones, respectively, ˆτ /τ is well below (above) one for τ0/τ
well below (above) one. When the recurrence intervals are randomly shuﬄed
(no memory), we obtain ˆτ (τ0)/τ ∼= 1, see Fig. 2, open symbols.

A more general quantity is the expected residual time ˆτ (x|τ0) to the next
event, when time x has been already elapsed. For x = 0, ˆτ (0|τ0) is identical
to ˆτ (τ0). In general, ˆτ (x|τ0) is related to D(τ |τ0) by

ˆτ (x|τ0) =

(τ − x)D(τ |τ0) dτ

D(τ |τ0) dτ .

For uncorrelated records, D(τ |τ0) is Poissonian, and ˆτ (x|τ0)/τ = 1.

Figure 3 clearly shows that ˆτ (x|τ0) depends on both x and τ0. With increas-
ing x, the expected residual time to the next event increases, as is shown in
Fig. 3, for values of τ0 from Q1 and Q4 (top and bottom curves). Thus, when
τ0 increases, ˆτ (x|τ0) increases for all values of x. The middle curve shows the
expected residual time averaged over all τ0, i.e. the unconditional residual time
ˆτ (x). In this case, the interval between the last two events is not taken into ac-
count, and the slower-than-Poisson-decrease of the unconditional distribution
function D(τ ), Eq. (1), leads to the anomalous increase of the mean residual
time with the elapsed time [3].

Our results for the unconditional residual time function for Californian earth-
quakes are very similar to the results of Corral [6] that were obtained for
worldwide earthquake records. As shown here, there is a strong memory in
the earthquake recurrence intervals, which inﬂuences signiﬁcantly the resid-
ual time. Similar memory eﬀects have been obtained recently for river ﬂux,
temperature and precipitation records (see [7, 8]).

To summarize, we have studied the memory eﬀect in the earthquake events and
showed that the distribution of the recurrence times and the mean residual
time until the next earthquake strongly depend on the previous recurrence
time. The conditional mean recurrence time between two events monotonically
increases with τ0. These results should be taken into account in an eﬃcient risk
evaluation and forecasting of earthquakes. It is very plausible that the origin
of these eﬀects is due to long-term persistence in the earthquake occurence.

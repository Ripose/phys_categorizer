We propose a novel method for analyzing precursory seismic data before an earthquake
that treats them as a Markov process and distinguishes the background noise from real
ﬂuctuations due to an earthquake. A short time (on the order of several hours) before
an earthquake the Markov time scale tM increases sharply, hence providing an alarm
for an impending earthquake. To distinguish a false alarm from a reliable one, we
compute a second quantity, T1, based on the concept of extended self-similarity of the
data. T1 also changes strongly before an earthquake occurs. An alarm is accepted if
both tM and T1 indicate it simultaneously. Calibrating the method with the data for one
region provides a tool for predicting an impending earthquake within that region. Our
analysis of the data for a large number of earthquakes indicate an essentially zero rate
of failure for the method.

Earthquakes are complex phenomena.1 Although still
subject to some debate, precursory anomalies, such as
changes in the seismic recordings, and anomalous vari-
ations in the chemical, hydrological, and electromag-
netic properties of the area in which earthquakes oc-
cur, usually precede a large earthquake.1,2 One school
of thought believes that the anomalies occur within days
to weeks before the main shock, but probably not much
earlier,3 and that the spatial precursory patterns develop
at short distances from impending large earthquakes. A
second school believes that the anomalies may occur up
to decades before large earthquakes, at distances much
larger than the length of the main shock rupture, a con-
cept closely linked to the theory of critical phenomena1,2
which was advocated1,4,5 as early as 1964 with a report4
documenting the existence of long-range correlations in
the precursors. Knopoﬀ et al.6 reported recently the exis-
tence of long-range spatial correlations in the increase of
medium-range magnitude seismicity prior to large earth-
quakes in California.

Pursuing a model of rock rupture and its relation
with critical phenomena and earthquakes,7 a method
of analysis was introduced8,9 that,
for certain values
of its parameters, led to a power law (typical of criti-
cal phenomena) for the system’s time-to-failure. Several
groups10 proposed percolation11 and hierarchical models
of damage/rupture prior to an earthquake. In particular,
Sahimi et al.12 proposed a connection between percola-

tion, the spatial distribution of earthquakes’ hypocen-
ters, and rock’s fracture/fault networks. Sornette and
Sammis13 developed a theory according to which the
power law that describes the accelerated seismicity close
to a large earthquake is accompanied by log-periodic cor-
rection terms,14 which were shown15 to also exist in the
power law that describes the increase in the energy that
rock releases as it undergoes fracturing. Such ideas were
further developed by Huang et al.,16 with empirical ev-
idence provided by Bowman et al.,17 and view a large
earthquake as a temporal singularity in the seismic time
series, resulting from the collective behavior and accu-
mulation of many previous smaller-size events.18 In this
picture, as the stress on rock increases, micro-ruptures
develop that redistribute the stress and generate ﬂuctu-
ations in it. As damage accumulates, the ﬂuctuations
become spatially and temporally correlated, resulting in
a larger number of signiﬁcantly-stressed large domains.
The correlations accelerate the spatial smoothing of the
ﬂuctuations, culminating in a rupture with a size on the
order of the system’s size, and representing its ﬁnal state
in which earthquakes occur. Numerical19 and empirical20
evidence for this picture indicates that, similar to criti-
cal phenomena, the correlation length of the stress-ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations increases signiﬁcantly before a large earth-
quake. Notwithstanding the evidence, proving or refut-
ing the notion of earthquakes as a critical phenomenon
entails replacing the proxies, used for checking the build-

up of the cooperativity that leads to large earthquakes,
by a direct measure of the dynamic evolution of the stress
ﬁeld. Unfortunately, such a procedure is far beyond the
present technical abilities.

A theory of earthquakes should predict, (1) when and
(2) where they occur in a wide enough region. It should
also be able to (3) distinguish a false alarm from a re-
liable one. In this paper, we propose a method for pre-
dicting earthquakes which possesses the three features.
The method estimates the Markov time scale (MTS) tM
of a seismic time series - the time over which the data
can be represented by a Markov process.21−25 As the
seismic data evolve with the time, so also does tM . We
show that the time evolutioon of tM provides an eﬀec-
tive alarm a short time before earthquakes. The method
distinguishes abnormal variations of tM before the arrival
of the P-waves, hence providing enough of a warning for
triggering a damage/death-avoiding response prior to the
arrival of the more damaging S-waves.

The method ﬁrst checks whether the seismic data
follow a Markov chain and,
if so, measures the func-
tion MTS tM .24−25 Characterization of the statisti-
cal properties of ﬂuctuations of n measured quanti-
ties of the stochastic process x(t) requires evaluation
of the joint probability distribution function (PDF)
Pn(x1, t1; · · · ; xn, tn).
If the data are a Markov pro-
cess, then, Pn = Πn−1
i=1 p(xi+1, ti+1|xi, ti)p(x1, t1), where
p(xi+1, ti+1|xi, ti) are conditional probabilities such that
the Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) equation,

p(x2, t2|x1, t1) =

dx3 p(x2, t2|x3, t3)p(x3, t3|x1, t1) (1)

Z

holds for any t3 in t1 < t3 < t2. The validity of
the CK equation for describing the process is checked
by comparing the directly-evaluated p(x2, t2|x1, t1) with
the those calculated according to right side of Eq.
(1). To determine tM for the data we compute for
given x1 and x2 the quantity, Q = |p(x2, t2|x1, t1) −
dx3p(x2, t2|x3, t3)p(x3, t3|x1, t1)|, in terms of, for exam-
ple, t3 − t1. In practice, we take t1 = 0 and t3 = 1
R
2 t2,
and vary t2. Plotting Q versus t3 produces the position
of tM in the limit Q → 0.25

Our analysis of seismic data (see below) indicates that
the average tM for the uncorrected background seismic
time series is much smaller than that for earthquakes data
(P-wave plus S-wave). Thus, at a certain time before an
earthquake, tM rises signiﬁcantly and provides an alarm
for the earthquake. As we show below, the alert time ta is
on the order of hours, and depends on the earthquake’s
magnitude M and the epicenter’s distance d from the
data-collecting station(s).

The sharp rise in tM at the moment of alarm is, in some
sense, similar to the increase in the correlation length
ξ of the stress-ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in the critical phenom-
ena theories of earthquake, since tM is also the time over
which the events leading to an earthquake are correlated.

Therefore, just as the correlation length ξ increases as the
catastrophic rupture develops, so also does tM . However,
whereas it is exceedingly diﬃcult to directly measure ξ,
tM is computed rather readily. Moreover, whereas ξ is
deﬁned for the entire rupturing system over long times,
tM is computed online (in real time), hence reﬂecting the
correlations of the most recent events that are presum-
ably most relevant to an impending earthquake.

To distinguish a false alarm that might be indicated
by tM from a true one, we use a second time-dependent
function that we compute based on the extended self-
similarity (ESS) of the seismic time series.24,25 The ESS
is characterized by Sp, a structure function of order p,
deﬁned by

Sp(τ ) = h|x(t + τ ) − x(t)|pi ∼ h|x(t + τ ) − x(t)|3iζp

(2)

where τ is the lag (in units of data points). The ﬁrst
nontrivial moment (beyond the average and variance) of
a distribution is S3, and because for a Gaussian process,
ζp = 1
3 p, the deviations from this relation represent non-
It is also well-known26,27 that the
Gaussian behavior.
moments Sp with p < 1 contain information on frequent
events in a time series. Prior to an earthquake the num-
ber of frequent events (development of cracks that join
up) suddenly rises, indicated by a sudden change in Sp
with p < 1. We observe that the starting point of Sp(τ )
(p < 1) versus S3(τ ) is diﬀerent for diﬀerent type of data
set.26,27 To determine the distance form the origin we de-
ﬁne the function T1 = T (τ = 1) = [S2
3 (τ =
1)]1/2. Close to an earthquake the function T1(t), also es-
timated online, suddenly changes and provides a second
alert. Its utility is due to the fact that it is estimated
very accurately even with very few data points, say 50,
hence enabling online analysis of the data collected over
intervals of about 1 second. Thus, even with few data
points, the method can detect the change of correlations
in the incoming data. For example, for correlated syn-
thetic data with a spectral density 1/f 2α−1, one obtains
T1 = −7α + 7.

We have analyzed the data for vertical ground
velocity Vz(t) for 173 earthquakes with magnitudes
3.2 ≤ M ≤ 6.3 that occurred in Iran between
and 47◦E and 62.5◦E
28◦N and 40◦N latitude,
longitude, between January 3 and July 26, 2004.
Recorded by 14 stations, the data can be accessed at
http://www.iiees.ac.ir/bank/bank 2004.html. The fre-
quency was 40 Hz for 2 of the stations and 50 Hz for
the rest. The vertical ground velocity data were ana-
lyzed because with our method they provide relatively
long (on the order of several hours), and hence useful,
alarms for the impending earthquakes. Fourty (discrete)
data points/second are recorded in the broad-band seis-
mogram for the vertical ground velocity x(t) ≡ Vz. To
analyze such data and provide alarms for the area for
which the data are analyzed, we proceed as follows.

FIG. 1. Time-dependence of T1 and tM for a recent earth-
quake of magnitude 6.3 in northern Iran, and their comparison
with the vertical ground velocity data Vz(t). tM is in number
of data points (the frequency at the station is 40 Hz), T1 is
dimensionless, while Vz(t) is in “counts” which, when multi-
−3, is converted to µm/sec. The
plied by a factor 1.1382 × 10
sensors were (broad-band) Guralp CMG-3T that collect data
in the east-west, north-south and vertical directions. The
thresholds are tM c = 5.6 and T1c = 0.88.

(1) The data are analyzed in order to check whether
they follow a Markov chain [the directly-computed
p(x2, t2|x1, t1) must be equal to the right side of Eq. (1)].
(2) The MTS tM (t) of the data are estimated by calcu-
lating the residual Q of the CK equation (see above).
For long-enough data series (103 data points or more)
the function tM (t) are estimated where Q → 0, but for
shorter series the minimum in Q provides estimates of
tM (t). (3) T1(t) is computed for the same data. To com-
pute Sp(τ ) (we used p = 1/10) the data x(t) are nor-
malized by their standard deviation, hence making T1
dimensionless. (4) Steps (1)-(3) are repeated for a large
number of previously-occurred earthquakes of size M at
a distance d from the station, referred to as (M, d) earth-
quakes. Earthquakes with M < Mc and d > dc are of no
practical importance and are ignored (we used Mc = 4.5
and dc = 150 km). (5) Deﬁne the thresholds tMc and
T1c such that for tM > tMc and T1 > T1c one has an
alert for an earthquake (M > Mc, d < dc). If tMc and
T1c are too large no alert is obtained, whereas one may
receive useless alerts if they are too small. By comparing
the data for all the earthquakes with M > Mc regis-
tered in a given station, tMc and T1c for the earthquakes
are estimated. (6) Real-time data analysis is performed
to compute the function tM (t) and T1(t). An alarm is
turned on if tM > tMc and T1 > T1c simultaneously.
When the alarm is turned on, it indicates that an earth-
quake of magnitude M ≥ Mc at a distance d ≤ dc is

going to occur. The procedure can be carried out for any
station. The larger the amount of data, the more precise
the alarm will be.

Figure 1 presents T1(t) and tM (t) for an M = 6.3
earthquake, occurred on May 28, 2004 at 12:36 am in
Baladeh at (36.37N, 51.64E, depth 28) in northern Iran.
The data were collected at Karaj station (near Tehran,
Iran) at a distance of 74 km from the epicenter, and a
depth of 70 m. The earthquake catalogue in the inter-
net address given above indicates that, for several days
before the main event, there was no foreshock in that re-
gion. Thus, T1 and tM provided a seven hour alarm for
the Baladeh earthquake. Since the data used for comput-
ing tM and T1 were, respectively, in strings of 200 and 50
points, there is no eﬀect of the events before they were
collected and, hence, the patterns in Fig. 1 reﬂect the
events taking place in the time period in which the data
were collected.

To estimate the alert times ta, which are on the or-
der of hours, we carried out an analysis of online data
for 14 stations in Iran’s broad-band network (the sensors
are Guralp CMG-3T broad-band), analyzing the verti-
cal ground velocity data. Our analysis indicates that ta
depends on M , being small for low M , but quite large
for large M . Using extensive data for the Iranian earth-
quakes with M ≥ 4.5 and d ≤ 150 km, we have ob-
tained an approximate relation for the broad-band sta-
tions, shown in Figure 2 and represented by

log ta = −1.35 + 2.4 log M ,

(3)

where ta is in hours. The numerical coeﬃcients of Eq.
(3) for each area should be estimated from the data col-
lected for that area. The above analysis can clearly be
extended to all the stations around the world. This is
currently underway for Iran’s network. For an earth-
quake of magnitude M = 4.5, Eq. (3) predicts an alert
time of about 2 hours. Thus, if, for example, three hours
after the alarm is turned on, the earthquake has not still
happened, we know that the magnitude of the coming
earthquake is M ≥ 5.7.

In summary, we have proposed a new method for ana-
lyzing seismic data and making predictions for when an
earthquake may occur with a magnitude M ≥ Mc at a
distance d ≤ dc. The method is based on computing
the Markov time scale tM , and a quantity T1 calculated
based on the concept of extended self-similarity of the
data, and monitoring them online as they evolve with the
time. If the two quantities exceed their respective critical
thresholds tcM and Tc1, estimated based on analyzing the
data for the previously-occurred earthquakes, an alarm
is tuned on. We are currently utilizing this method for
Iran’s stations. To do so, we calibrate the method with
the data for the stations in one region (i.e., estimate tcM
and Tc1 for distances d < dc). If in a given region there
is a single station, then once the online-computed tM

and T1 exceed their critical values, the alarm is turned
on. If there are several stations, then once they declare
that their tM and T1 have exceeded their thresholds, the
alarm is turned on. If after about 2 hours, no earthquake
has occurred yet, then we know that the magnitude of
the incoming earthquake will be greater Mc = 4.5 at a
distance d < dc.

Over the past two years, the method has been utilized
in the Iranian stations. Our analysis indicates that the
method’s failure rate decreases to essentially zero when
tM and T1 provide simultaneous alarms. That is, practi-
cally every earthquake that we have considered, including
those that have been occurring while we have been per-
forming online analysis of their incoming data and pro-
viding alarms for them (with M > Mc), was preceded by
an alarm. Of all the earthquakes that we have analyzed
so far, the method has failed in only two cases. In our
experience, if after 10 hours no earthquake occurs, we
count that as a failed case. However, as mentioned, we
have so far had only two of such cases.

Finally, it must be pointed out that the most accurate
alarms are obtained from stations that receive data from
depths of > 50 m, and are perpendicular to the active
faults that cause the earthquake, since they receive much
more correlated data for the development of the cracks
than any other station.

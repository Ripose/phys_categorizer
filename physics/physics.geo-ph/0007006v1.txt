ABSTRACT

We developed a new technology for global detection of atmospheric disturbances, on the
basis of phase measurements of the total electron content (TEC) using an international GPS
networks. Temporal dependencies of TEC are obtained for a set of spaced receivers of the
GPS network simultaneously for the entire set of visible satellites. These series are subjected
to ﬁltering in the selected range of oscillation periods using known algorithms for
spatio-temporal analysis of signals. An ”instantaneous” ionospheric response to the sudden
commencement of a strong magnetic storm of April 6, 2000 was detected. On the dayside of
the Earth the largest value of the net response amplitude was found to be of order 0.8 × 1016
m−2 (1–2% of the background TEC value), and the delay with respect to the SC in
mid-latitudes was about 200 s. In higher latitudes the delay goes as long as 15 min. On the
nightside these values are 0.2 × 1016 m−2 and 30 min, respectively. The velocity of the
traveling disturbance from the middle to high latitudes on the dayside as well as from the
dayside to the nightside was about 10-20 km/s.

INTRODUCTION

Mid-latitude ionospheric eﬀects of geomagnetic disturbances of diﬀerent origins were addressed in
many publications, including a number of thorough reviews (Hunsucker, 1982; Hocke and Schlegel,
1996). It is now a well-established fact that the auroral zones of the northern and southern
hemispheres generate acoustic-gravity waves (AGW) and traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs),
caused by them, of the type of solitary wave of about 1-hour duration propagating in the equatorial
direction with sound and subsonic speeds (from 100 to 300 m/s). The occurrence delay τ TIDs over
various observing stations in mid-latitudes reaches 104 s. The propagation velocity fundamentally

distinguishes the TIDs from sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) which are a virtually
instantaneous (τ no more than 10−3 s) response of the dayside ionosphere to an increase in
ultraviolet radiation intensity observed during chromospheric ﬂares on the Sun (Mitra, 1974). The
physical mechanisms for generation of the above-mentioned types of disturbances were discussed in
a large number of theoretical publications, and are considered to be relatively reliably established.
By analyzing the ionospheric eﬀects from a strong magnetic storm of April 6, 2000, we detected,
most likely, a new manifestation of geomagnetic disturbances in the mid-latitude ionosphere
implying an ”instantaneous” (compared to the above-mentioned TID eﬀects) ionospheric response
to the magnetic storm sudden commencement (SC). For detecting this eﬀect, we used a global
spatial averaging of the variations in total electron content (TEC) obtained from the data from the
international GPS network. Currently (as of June 2000) this network includes at least 712 points,
the data from which are posted to the INTERNET. High-precision measurements of the TEC along
the line-of-sight (LOS) between the receiver on the ground and transmitters on the GPS system
satellites covering the reception zone are made using two-frequency multichannel receivers of the
GPS system at almost any point of the globe and at any time simultaneously at two coherently
coupled frequencies f1 = 1575.42 MHz and f2 = 1227.60 MHz. The sensitivity of phase
measurements in the GPS system is suﬃcient for detecting irregularities with an amplitude of up to
10−3–10−4 of the diurnal TEC variation. This makes it possible to formulate the problem of
detecting ionospheric disturbances from diﬀerent sources of artiﬁcial and natural origins.

RESULTS OF OBSERVATIONS

For the time interval 16:00-18:00 UT, Fig. 1 presents the variations in magnetic ﬂux (a), 5 MeV
proton ﬂux (b) at geostationary orbit of the GOES10 station (135◦W ), and of the H-component of
the magnetic ﬁeld at station Irkutsk (52.2◦N; 104.3◦E - c) for April 6, 2000. The time of the
geomagnetic disturbance SC, determined from these data and from the data from other
ground-based magnetic observatories, including those located in the western hemisphere (on the
dayside), corresponds to 16:42 (16.7) UT. The time of SC is shown on panels (a-e) by a vertical
dashed line. The geometry of the part of the global GPS network that was used in this study when
analyzing the ionospheric response to the SC of the strong magnetic storm of April 6, 2000 (180
stations), is presented in Fig. 2a. Dots correspond to the location of GPS stations; we do not give
here their coordinates for reasons of space. The upper scale indicates the local time LT,
corresponding to the time 16 UT. As is evident from Fig. 2a, our selected set of GPS stations cover
reasonably densely North America and Europe, and much less densely the Asian part of the
territory used in the analysis. An even smaller number of GPS stations are in the Paciﬁc and
Atlantic Oceans. However, coverage of the territory with partial LOS to the satellites for our
selected limitations to the LOS elevations θ ¿ 10◦ is substantially wider. Panel b shows the
coordinates of subionospheric points for the height of the F2-layer maximum hmax = 300 km for all
satellites visible at the SC time for each of the GPS stations marked on panel a (a total of 746
beams). An analysis of the TEC data from the selected GPS stations revealed that almost all
stations over the time interval 16:30-17:30 UT, containing the SC time, show a single negative
disturbance of about 20-min duration. Upon removing the trend and smoothing with a time
window of 30 min, we were able to determine for each beam to the satellite the amplitude A and
the time tmin at which a minimum TEC value was attained. Fig. 3 presents the latitudinal
dependencies (obtained for each beam) of the tmin -a) and of the amplitude A - b) of the
ionospheric response to the magnetic storm SC, as well as the distributions of tmin - c) and A - d)
as a function of local time LT. The SC time is shown in panels e and j by a horizontal straight line.
Thick curves show the approximating dependencies obtained from all counts using polynomials of
degree 4. The scatter of the position of tmin is due to the fact that when the trend is removed with

a time window of 30 min, the response to the SC is always overlapped by existing TEC oscillations
with similar periods and with a random phase. Therefore, identifying the response requires a
coherent combination of TEC variations for all LOS. The result of such a global spatial averaging
of dI(t) for 511 LOS on the dayside is shown in panel d. A similar result for 235 LOS on the
nightside is presented in panel e.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

An analysis of the data in Fig. 1 suggests the conclusion that the ionospheric response to the SC
has the form of a single negative disturbance of about 20-min duration. On the dayside of the
Earth the largest value of the net response amplitude was found to be of order 0.8 × 1016 m−2
(1–2% of the background TEC value), and the delay with respect to the SC in mid-latitudes was
about 200 s. In higher latitudes the delay goes as long as 15 min. On the nightside these values are
0.2 × 1016 m−2 and 30 min, respectively. Of special note is that the onset of negative TEC
disturbance on the dayside, marked according to the level of 0.5 from a maximum deviation (panel
d), coincides with the magnetic ﬂux SC (panel a) and is 120 s ahead of the SC time determined
from the data from ground-based magnetic observatories. The velocity of the traveling disturbance
from middle to high latitudes as well as from the dayside to the nightside is estimated at about
10-20 km/s. Thus our detected disturbance (a global delay τ no more than 102 - 103 s) is
inexplicable in terms of the AGW model, and it should be sought when modeling a electromagnetic
set of phenomena accompanying a strong geomagnetic disturbance. It is not improbable that in the
analysis of the mechanism it would be useful to take into account some important characteristics of
the ”global detector” which we are using, such as primarily the sensitivity, continuity and global
character. However, it may well be of crucial importance that, unlike conventional techniques of
ionospheric observations, the altitude limit of which does not exceed 500 km (ionosondes, HF
Doppler measurements) or 1000-2000 km (incoherent scatter radars, and stations for recording the
rotation of the polarization plane of the VHF signal from geostationary satellites), it has become
possible, for the ﬁrst time, to carry out a global detection of the Earth’s plasmaspheric
disturbances in the height range as high as 20,000 km.

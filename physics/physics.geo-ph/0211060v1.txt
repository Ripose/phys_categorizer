Abstract

We present results from a physical experiment which demonstrates that a sheared granular
medium behaves in a manner analogous to earthquake activity. The device consists of an
annular plate rotating over a granular medium in a stick-slip fashion. Previous observations
by us include a bounded critical state with a power law distribution of event energy con-
sistent with the Gutenberg-Richter law, here we also reveal stair-case seismicity, clustering,
foreshocks, aftershocks and seismic quiescence. Subcritical and supercritical regimes have also
been observed by us depending on the system conﬁguration. We investigate the predictability
of large events. Using the quiescence between ‘shock’ events as an alarm condition, it is found
that large events are respectively unpredictable, marginally predictable and highly predictable
in the subcritical, critical and supercritical states.

Keywords: Earthquakes – model – granular – stick-slip – prediction – self-organised criticality

Introduction

Due to the destructive nature, and too often devastating consequences of earthquakes, it has long
been the aim of seismologists to predict them. In this regard, the term ”earthquake prediction” is
identiﬁed with a short-term process which would specify the time, place of occurrence and size of
a single earthquake with suﬃcient accuracy for authorities to arrange an evacuation (Main, 1997).
Yet to date no undisputed earthquake prediction scheme of this type exists. Indeed, while the
optimism for such a scheme was high in the 1970s (Geller, 1997), it is now questionable whether
it is possible at all (Main, 1997; Geller, 1997; Evans, 1997). On the other hand, ”Seismic Hazard
Assessment” refers to the process by which the general likelihood of an earthquake occurring in a
region is established, based on its activity history (Main, 1996). Such assessments are generally
used for the coding of building practices for example and may be the best approach for reducing
earthquake damage (Main, 1997).

The predictability issue of earthquakes is intertwined with the idea that earthquakes are a
self-organised critical phenomenon (Bak & Tang, 1989). Short-term earthquake prediction would
then be practically impossible, since the sensitivity to ﬂuctuations at a critical point would require
the details of the entire system to be known. Nevertheless, individual earthquakes have been
associated with precursors, for example foreshocks, or seismic quiescence preceding an event (Main,
1996; Turcotte, 1991), and such phenomena might be used to signal the imminence of an event.
Although, there is no unambiguous earthquake precursor (Main, 1997; Evans, 1997), foreshocks
are recognized by the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth’s Interior
(IASPEI) as signiﬁcant possible precursors to earthquake activity, while seismic quiescence can
currently be neither accepted nor rejected (Wyss, 1997).

An important diﬃculty in the study of earthquakes is that seismic catalogues on which earth-
quake statistics and analysis are based are limited both temporally and spatially. In many parts
of the world, earthquake records are only decades old, while in some instances increasing and de-
creasing regional earthquake activity can result from the installation and removal of monitoring
stations or be a consequence of isolated studies (Mu˜noz-Diosdado & Angulo-Brown, 1999). The
necessity for synthetic catalogues is clear.

1

Numerical models capable of generating seismicity catalogues include notably the Burridge-
Knopoﬀ model and its many derivatives (Turcotte, 1997). An alternative to the numerical models,
and one which is considered here, is to use a physical model. Earthquakes on a preexisting fault
are assumed to be fundamentally the result of many interacting degrees of freedom subjected to
a slowly increasing shear stress causing stick-slip motion. Such a deﬁnition would also have the
necessary if not perhaps suﬃcient ingredients for a self-organised critical process. In this picture
higher order features, such as quiescence, foreshocks, aftershocks and other patterns of associated
earthquake activity would be expected to emerge from the system interactions. The beneﬁt of
a physical over a computational model is that it may more adequately represent or capture the
entire set of physical interaction rules underlying the system. The distinction between the physical
system and the well-known cellular automaton earthquake model by Olami, Feder & Christensen
(OFC) (Olami et al., 1992), for example, is then primarily the rules of interaction. Generating
the seismic activity from the physical experiment in this non-conﬁned manner, one may construct
synthetic seismicity catalogues and explore these for evidence of predictability.

The paper is organised as follows. Initially, we outline a physical experiment already developed
by us to study granular stick-slip motion, and explain why this might be considered as a model for
earthquake activity. We highlight the previous identiﬁcation by us of 3 earthquake states, critical,
subcritical and supercritical and then explore the predictability of these states.

2 An Earthquake Model

The possibility that earthquake activity might be related to granular dynamics has been raised in
a number of recent papers (Nasuno et al., 1997; Aharonov & Sparks, 1999; ˚Astr¨om et al., 2000;
Toomey & Bean, 2000). We have previously studied the stick-slip motion of a sheared granular
bed (Dalton & Corcoran, 2001, 2002) using a physical experiment. The experimental apparatus
consists of an annular top plate which is driven over the surface of a granular bed conﬁned to a
circular channel. The plate is driven by the action of a motor via a torsion spring. In this manner,
the motor winds the torsion spring, increasing the torque on the plate. Ultimately friction can no
longer sustain the applied torque, and the plate spins.

The experiment falls under the general deﬁnition for the earthquake model given above, in which
the interacting degrees of freedom are the positions and velocities of individual grains determined
by the forces, including friction, acting on the grains. The slowly increasing shear stress is provided
by the action of the motor and torsion spring while the granular medium is in the solid phase. We
consider now the dynamic behavior of the experiment to see if it is consistent with seismic activity.
We have previously found that the system behaves in a manner consistent with a self-organized
critical process
(Bak et al., 1987) for a subset of its operating conditions, and we have used
the term ”bounded self-organized criticality” to account for the ﬁnite basin of attraction of the
critical state (Dalton & Corcoran, 2002). Most importantly, the distribution of event sizes in the
system critical state is consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter distribution of earthquakes (Dalton
& Corcoran, 2001). Events release energy E with power-law probability p(E) ∼ E−B−1, with
B = 0.88 ± 0.04. This lies within the range expected for real earthquakes 1/3 < B < 1 (Main,
1995).

The experiment also exhibits subcritical and supercritical states of earthquake activity
(Dalton & Corcoran, 2002). These states in addition to the critical state are observed in com-
putational earthquake models (Rundle & Klein, 1993). Indeed, Lomnitz-Adler (1993) examined 40
diﬀerent cases of earthquake cellular automata, and in all cases the results can be classiﬁed into
one of these 3 states (Main, 1996).

Earthquake activity is also demonstrated in staircase seismicity and clustering of large events.
Large events are deﬁned here for the physical experiment as those above a threshold size where
deviation from scale-invariant behavior in the power law distribution of event size occurs (see
(Dalton & Corcoran, 2002) ibid. ﬁg. 2). Considering a representative critical experiment, ﬁg. 1
plots the cumulative number of large events (size ≥ 10◦) in the system as time progresses. The
‘staircase’ nature of earthquake activity is clearly shown, and compares well with data of real
earthquake activity in the Mexican Paciﬁc coast (Mu˜noz-Diosdado & Angulo-Brown, 1999). Similar
results are obtained for the supercritical and subcritical states. The magnitude of all large events
in the critical system is plotted as a function of time in ﬁg. 2. Activity clearly occurs in clusters,

2

with isolated events between. Also shown is a plot of real earthquake activity obtained from the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) web-site (United States Geological Survey, 2001), for
earthquakes of magnitude M ≥ 5.0 in a circle of radius 500 km about San Francisco. Activity is
clustered here also.

The activity of the apparatus, while in the representative critical state has also been considered
in the temporal vicinity of a large event. To perform the analysis, the time of occurrence of all
large events was extracted from the data. Activity before and after each large event was then
superimposed, and the average activity about this ’stacked’ or ‘conglomerate’ event computed.
The activity considered was restricted to shock events of size S ≥ 0.1◦ and was averaged over
intervals of 5 s duration. The time of occurrence of the main event is denoted t0 (in our graphs we
set t0 = 0). Overall, there were 104 large events, and the average shock activity was approximately
R = 0.14 Hz (ie. one shock occurred, on average, every 7 s).

The sequence of activity following the large events is shown in ﬁg. 3. Activity is seen to decrease
from an elevated value (R ≃ 0.28 Hz), back to the steady value in a period of 100 to 200 s. The
best-ﬁt curve to this decay is a power-law R(t) ∼ (t − t0)−p, shown by the straight line ﬁt, with
exponent p ≃ 0.2. The decay is reminiscent of Omori’s law where the activity of earthquakes falls
oﬀ as a power-law with exponent p ≃ 1. Variations in the power laws exponents for after shock
(1999),
rates have also been obtained in the computational earthquake model of Hainzl et al.
where the exponent is dependent on the feed back of energy lost during an earthquake into the
fault zone.

Prior to a large event, the activity decreases from the steady rate almost to zero, and then
immediately before the large event, increases. Fig. 4 shows this data. Activity is largely constant
at 0.14 Hz until approximately t = −50 s. At this point, there is a decrease to 1.9 mHz, and
then an abrupt rise immediately before the main event in a power-law fashion: R(t) ∼ (t0 − t)−q,
q ≃ 1.6. Thus by examining the sequence of activity about large events in the physical model, as
in the case of earthquakes, aftershocks, quiescence, and foreshocks are also observed.

In the physical experiment of a sheared granular medium one therefore sees many of the char-
acteristics of earthquake dynamics, including a power law distribution of event energy consistent
with the Gutenberg-Richter law, stair-case seismicity, clustering, foreshocks, aftershocks and seis-
mic quiescence. We conclude that the physical experiment is behaving in a manner analogous to
an earthquake fault.

3 Predictability of the Earthquake Model

Given the presence of precursors, what are the implications for predictability in the representative
critical state? The power-law increase in activity of ﬁg. 4 is based on 104 large events for which
48 foreshocks were issued. However, instead of 48 of the 104 large events issuing one foreshock
each, the foreshocks are due only to 25 of the large events (24%). Despite the clear change in
statistical behavior as a large event is approached, the mean behavior observed describes only a
small proportion of large events and thus severely limits its application for prediction purposes.
It is interesting that studies of real earthquakes indicate that approximately one-quarter have
foreshocks (Turcotte, 1991, 1997), in agreement with the value of 24% obtained here. Comparison
of greater volumes of real and artiﬁcial data are needed to establish if this agreement holds, or is
merely coincidence.

Consider now the quiescence of ﬁg. 4 where the activity before the main shocks decreases to
1.9 mHz. This indicates that, for the 5 s interval represented by that point (−25 ≤ t0 − t ≤ −20
s), only one of the 104 large events was active. This is clearly beyond the bounds of random
probability, and hence it must be concluded that large events are almost always preceded by a
quiet period 20 to 25 s before a large event. Unfortunately, the sense of this conclusion cannot
be reversed. That is, it is not correct to say that a quiet 5 s interval will lead to a large event in
about 20 s time. The mean rate of shocks is 0.14 Hz, so two in every seven 5 s intervals will, on
average, be inactive. Hence a more detailed study of each sequence of activity is necessary.

Analysis of the data reveals that 84 of the 104 events were shortly preceded by a 40 s period
in which no activity occurred and for the entire duration of the experiment, there were a total of
160 periods lasting 40 s each, in which no activity took place. Again, 84 of these led to a large
event. We can use this to generate a simple prediction algorithm where a 40 s interval in which

3

no activity occurs is the condition upon which an ”Imminent Large Event” alarm is raised. We
stress that we are not proposing a novel earthquake prediction scheme here, merely presenting an
analysis of our data. The 20 large events which were not preceded by an alarm can be regarded as
a failure-to-predict. Furthermore, there were 76 false-alarms, also failures of the scheme, and there
are a total of 84 successful predictions. Hence the success rate of this scheme is 84/(76+84+20)
= 47%. The false alarm rate, the fraction of alarms which are not followed by a large event, is
76/160 = 47% and the failure-to-predict rate, the fraction of large events which are not predicted,
is 20/104 = 19%.

Finally, the relationship between the duration of the quiescent period before an event to the
subsequent size of the main event, is presented in ﬁg. 5. The power-law bestﬁt indicates an upward
trend, though the data is far too poorly correlated to make any deﬁnite assumptions (correlation
coeﬃcient r = 0.40). Similar results are observed for earthquakes (Scholtz, 1994). The implication
is that event size is eﬀectively independent of the quiescence duration. While it might be possible
to predict the imminent arrival of an event, the conclusion that must be drawn is that it is not
possible to predict its size. One notes this result diﬀers from recent computational work (Hainzl et
al., 2000), in which quiescence in a modiﬁed OFC cellular automata model was shown to correlate
with subsequent event size.

4 Other Earthquake States

4.1 Subcritical State
Fig. 6 is a plot of activity about ‘large’ events (deﬁned here as event sizes ≥ 3◦) for a representative
subcritical experiment. While the device still demonstrates seismic quiescence, foreshocks are not
so evident and a decaying aftershock sequence is not present. Overall, in the subcritical state,
it emerges that large event predictability based on quiescence is low. The optimum algorithm
using a 20 s interval predicts large events with a 23% success rate, 64% false-alarms and 61%
failure-to-predict.

4.2 Supercritical State

The seismicity of large events in a representative supercritical state is dominated by the recurrent
large events to which this state is susceptible (Dalton & Corcoran, 2002). The events do not appear
to cluster to one another. For the supercritical state, it may be true to say that the next large event
(S ≥ 15◦) will probably occur 200 s after the previous one. Interestingly, the torque ﬂuctuations
for supercritical data do not reveal discrete Fourier components in their power spectra (Dalton &
Corcoran, 2002), though this may arise from the periodic element being lost in the dominant 1/f2
noise spectrum.

Activity about the large events in the supercritical state is notably diﬀerent to the previous two
states (see ﬁg. 7). A precursory quiescence is still observed, though in this case, the quiescence
commences at t = −150 s, from 0.07 Hz to zero. The zero activity is completely maintained right
up to the main event excluding one shock at t = −2.5 s. Thus foreshocks appear to be non-existent
in this state.

Aftershocks also behave in a diﬀerent fashion to the critical and subcritical states. The rate of
shocks is seen to decrease after the main event, following an exponential decay, to a level below the
mean rate, and then, with decaying oscillations, it settles back to the mean rate. The existence
of the exponential decay suggests that the apparatus is no longer operating at a critical point
characterized by scale invariant power-laws. The oscillatory eﬀect is attributed to the recurrent
nature of these large events.

In the supercritical state, large events are almost perfectly predictable as the following data
will demonstrate. Over the period of the experiment there were 142 large events and 144 intervals
of length 100 s or longer. Each of these large events was preceded by such an interval, and so
a prediction based on these parameters will have a 99% success rate, 1% false alarms and 0%
failures-to-predict.

5 The General Critical State

The critical behavior marks a transition between the well deﬁned sub and supercritical states. The
latter are easily identiﬁable and experimentally repeatable, but the critical state has been found to
exhibit a richer variety of behavior (Dalton & Corcoran, 2002). Of seven critical experiments, all
exhibit qualitatively similar patterns in terms of the clustering and intermittency of large events.
However, some of them have fewer large events (ie. S ≥ 10◦) and so it is necessary to reduce the
threshold for ‘large’ events in order to make the clustering visible. The cumulative number of
events obtained from four of the seven experiments tend to show a more uniform slope, attributed
to this rarity of large events; rarer large events necessarily implies more frequent smaller events,
leading to the more uniform slope.

The Omori-type power-law decay in aftershocks is repeated by ﬁve of the seven experiments,
with exponent 0.2 ≤ p ≤ 0.45. For precursory behavior, all show a quiescence beginning approxi-
mately 40 s before the main event, followed by an increase in activity in six experiments. However,
the increase can only be clearly ﬁt with a power-law in three cases, the remainder having statistics
that are too low for any curveﬁt (with perhaps only 10 foreshocks occurring in total).

Of the seven experiments, three had similar success rate ≃47%, false alarm rate ≃48% and
failure-to-predict rate ≃19%. The remaining four had success rate ≃16%, false alarm rate ≃80%
and failure-to-predict rate ≃44%. This disparity may arise because the experiments with higher
predicability are nearer the transition to the supercritical state where events are highly predictable.
The experiments with lower predictability may similarly be near the transition to the subcritical
state where large events are highly unpredictable. We note that this interpretation would also
be consistent with variability in the torque value, and variability in the event size and duration
distributions previously reported for the critical state (Dalton & Corcoran, 2002).

6 Conclusion

A sheared granular experiment has been shown here to behave in a manner analogous to earthquake
activity and has previously been shown by us to exhibit bounded self-organised criticality. The
observation of 3 distinct dynamic states, above, below and in a critical region has an important
implication for the concept of self-organized criticality as applied to physical systems, speciﬁcally
here earthquakes. The sub and supercritical states are outside the critical region, yet in these
cases and at criticality, for many diﬀerent initial experimental conﬁgurations scale invariant event
distributions are observed over several decades. Thus, while not perhaps self-organised critical,
the experimental system is robustly self-organised to near criticality. It may be that earthquakes
are similarly self-organised.

In the physical experiment, the ability of the granular material to dilate is believed to be
responsible for the tuning of the system to the diﬀerent system states (Dalton & Corcoran, 2001,
In
2002). A physical cause is therefore responsible for the observation of the diﬀerent states.
actual earthquake statistics, the subjective choice of study area is known to eﬀect the tail of the
distribution, with large areas revealing sub-critical behavior and smaller areas more supercritical
behavior (Main, 1996). This points to the diﬃculty of objectively constraining the observational
data for the largest earthquakes. By studying the limits and sizes of the basins of attraction for
the various states of the physical experiment, one might be able to determine the most probable
tail for the scale-invariant distribution. Preliminary results (Lynch et al., 2002) suggest that the
most common state for the experiment is subcritical, in agreement with recent statistical work on
global earthquake data (Leonard et al., 2001).

Seismic quiescence is common to both earthquakes and large events in the experiments here.
This quiescence has been utilized as a simple prediction scheme. The prediction algorithm essen-
tially obtains the statistical likelihood of a large event occurring after a long quiescent period. From
this statistical point of view, a certain level of prediction will always be possible even though the
system is close to criticality, assuming a detailed history of the fault is available and the behavior
is stationary.

The simple prediction algorithm implemented suggests marginal predictability for the critical
state, with some experiments predictable and some not, the diﬀerence being the proximity of the
speciﬁc critical state to the sub and super critical regimes. Large events in the subcritical state

seem to exhibit low predictability, while events in the supercritical state appear to be (almost)
perfectly predictable.

Abstract

This paper presents an analysis of the distribution of the time τ be-
tween two consecutive events in a stationary point process. The study
is motivated by the discovery of a uniﬁed scaling law for τ for the case
of seismic events. It is shown that the uniﬁed law must necessarily be
exponential. We discuss the parameterization of the empirical uniﬁed
law and the physical meaning of the parameters involved.

1 Introduction

The studies [1],[2],[3] have discovered a new scaling law for seismic events
on the phase space location-time-magnitude. Speciﬁcally, the distribution
density for time τ between two consecutive events of magnitude m > mc has
the form

pτ (t) = λf (λt)

(1)

where λ is the rate of events with m > mc in a given area G, while f is a
universal function that is independent of the choice of G and cutoﬀ magnitude
mc. The relation (1) is astonishing, being tested (as it has been in [3]) for
a very wide range of mc (between 2 and 7.5), for seismic regions G of very
diﬀerent linear size L (between 20 km and the size of the Earth), as well
as for diﬀerent catalogs, both regional and global ones, and diﬀerent time
periods.

The parameterization of f seems not yet to have settled down. According

to [3]:

f (x) = cxγ−1 exp(−x/a)

(2)

in the region x ≥ 0.05 with γ = 0.74±0.05 and a = 1.23±.15. The pioneering
work [1] uses a parameterization of (2) for the whole range of x with γ = 0.1
(see reﬁned estimates in [2]). This allows the behavior of f (x) about zero to
be interpreted in terms of the Omori law.

The subsequent discussion strives to answer the following questions:
What is the distribution of τ in examples of synthetic seismicity?
What is the physical meaning of the parameters γ and a in (2)?
Assuming the form of f to be universal for τ , what should it be?

2 The Model

Earthquakes frequently form anomalous clusters in space-time. The largest
event in a cluster is termed the main event. The events that occurred be-
fore and after the main event in a cluster are called fore- and aftershocks,

2

respectively. It is assumed in a zero approximation that main events consti-
tute a time-uniform Poisson process. That assumption is widely employed
in seismic risk studies.

Aftershocks dominate clusters both as regards their number and duration.

Their rate as a function of time is described by the Omori law:

n(t) = ct−p,

t > t0,

(3)

where t0 is small. Relation (3) holds fairly well during the ﬁrst few tens of
days (up to a year) with the parameter p = 0.7 − 1.4 [4]. At large times
the value of p becomes greater, occasionally signiﬁcantly so, making n(t)
decay in an exponential manner. Taken on the whole, background seismicity
and spatial interaction do not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn for the
Omori law at large times. Cases in which (3) holds during decades are unique
[4].

Following the above description, we consider the following model for seis-
mic events in time. The spatial and magnitude components of an event are
disregarded for simplicity of reasoning. Let {xi} be a homogeneous point
Poisson process on a line with rate λ∗. It is an analogue of main events. Let
N0(dt) be an inhomogeneous point process with rate δ(t) + λ0(t). Here, δ
is the delta function, while the presence of δ(t) means that the event t = 0
belongs to N0. The notation N0(∆) deﬁnes the number of events N0 in the
interval ∆. We will assume that

λ0(t) dt = Λ < ∞.

Z

(4)

This requirement ensures that the total number of events in N0 is a.s. bounded.

Our task is to describe the distribution of τ between two consecutive
events in N. The distribution is uniquely speciﬁed, because the process N is
stationary. It is also easy to see that the rate of N is

λ = λ∗(1 + Λ).

According to [5],

P (τ > t) =

P {N([a, t]) = 0}

(cid:12)

and

P (N(∆) = 0) = exp{−λ∗

P (N0(∆ − x) > 0) dx}.

Z

The last relation follows from the fact that the main events are poissonian.
Since the aftershocks make the bulk of a cluster, we shall assume in what
follows that λ0(t) = 0 for t > 0. Consequently,

P (N0(∆) > 0) =

1,
0,

(cid:26)

if 0 ∈ ∆
if ∆ ⊂ (−∞, 0).

Combining the above relations, one gets

P (τ > t) = exp{−λ∗

P (N0(u, t + u) > 0) du − λ∗t} ×

(6)

× [P (N0(0, t) = 0) +

P (N0(du) > 0, N0(u, u + t) = 0)]/(1 + Λ).

We now describe the behavior of the distribution of τ near 0 and ∞.
Statement 1. (a) If cluster duration has a ﬁnite mean, ¯τcl, then

P (τ > t) = exp (−λ∗(t + ¯τcl))/(1 + Λ) · (1 + o(1)),

t → ∞.

(b) Let λ0(t) ∼ ct−1−θ, t → ∞ where 0 < θ < 1. Then

P (τ > t) = exp (−λ∗t − O(t1−θ))/(1 + Λ),

t → ∞.

(7)

In other words, one has

ln P (τ > t)/(λt) = λ∗/λ

lim
t→∞

for a Poisson sequence of main events in a broad class of cluster models. In
terms of the parameterization of (2), that means that

a = λ/λ∗ = 1 + Λ.

With a = 1.23 (as in [3]) the main events make a−1 ≃ 81% of the total
number of events.

The following regularity conditions should be imposed on N0 in order to

be able to describe how the distribution density for τ behaves for small t:

P (N0(u, u + t) > 0 | N0{u + t} = 1) = o(1),

t → 0

(8)

P (N0(u, u + t) > 0 | N0{u} = 1, N0{u + t}) = o(1),

t → 0

(9)

where the notation | denotes conditional probability, and N0{s} = 1 means
that there is an event at the point s. We assume in addition that (8), (9)
hold uniformly in u ≥ 0.

That last requirement is no limitation for the case of seismic events, con-
sidering that the rate of cluster events and time relations between them
seem to be rapidly decaying over time. The requirements (8), (9) themselves
ensure that two very closely lying cluster events are not likely to contain
another cluster event between them, that is, (8), (9) express the requirement
of sparseness or repulsion for events that are close in time. It follows from
the obvious inequality P (N0(∆) > 0) < EN0(∆) that (8), (9) will hold, if
one demands that

E(N0(u, u + t)|A) = o(1),

t → 0,

5

where A = (N0{u + t} = 1) in the case (8) and A = (N0{u} = 1, N0{u + t} =
1) in the case (9).

Statement 2. If (8), (9) hold, the probability density for τ (provided it

exists) has the following form as t → 0:

∞

Z
0

pτ (t) = [λ0(t) +

λ0(u)λu(t) du + λ(1 + Λ)]/(1 + Λ) · (1 + o(1)),

(10)

where λu(t) = P (N0(t + u, t + u + δ) > 0 | N0{u} = 1)/δ is the conditional
rate of N0 after time u given a cluster event has occurred at that time. In
particular, if λ0(t) ↑ ∞ as t → 0 and

λu(t) < k λ0(t),

0 < t < ε,

(11)

then

1 < pτ (t)/λ0(t) < c,

t → 0.

In other words, when (8), (9) hold, the distribution density for τ for small t
is proportional to the rate of cluster events immediately after the main event.
The statement is not obvious, since any interevent interval is not necessarily
started by a main event.

The proofs of the Statements have been relegated to the Appendix.

3 Examples

Examples will now be discussed to be able to understand how far the above
assumptions are restrictive.

The trigger model. Historically, this is the ﬁrst seismicity model to appear
(see [6]). It assumes the cluster process N0 to be poissonian. The model has
not found acceptance in seismicity statistics, because the likelihood of an
observed sample in that model is technically diﬃcult to use. This does not
rule out that the model may be helpful, however.

6

Because increments in N0 are independent, the requirement (8), (9) has

the form

P (N0(u, u + t) > 0) =

λ0(x) dx = o(1),

t → 0.

If λ0(x) is a decreasing function, one has

u+t

Z
u

λ0(x) dx <

λ0(v) dv = o(1).

Consequently, the decrease of λ0(x) ensures that (8), (9) take place uniformly
in u. The same property of λ0(x) also ensures (11):

λu(t) = λ0(u + t) < λ0(t).

We now are going to reﬁne the asymptotic form of pτ (t) for small t.

Let λ0(x) be a smooth decreasing function and λ0(t) = ct−p, t < 1. Then

pτ (t) ≃ ct−p + c1t−α + c2,

t → 0,

where α = 2p − 1 for p > 1/2 and α = 0 for p ≤ 1/2.

This can be seen as follows. When p > 1/2, one has

It =

λ0(u)λu(t) = c2

The self-exciting model. A cluster in this model is generated by the fol-
lowing cascade process. The ﬁrst event t = 0 is deﬁned as the event of rank

cribed rank 1. The procedure then becomes recursive: each event {t(r)
i } of
rank r = 1, 2, ... generates a Poisson process of its own which is independent
of the previous ones and which has the rate π0(t − t(r)
i ). The oﬀspring of a
rank r event are events of rank r + 1, the events of all ranks constituting the
desired cluster N0.

The process N with clusters as described above is known as the self-
exciting model [7] or the epidemic type model [8]. The model is rather
popular in the statistical studies and forecasting of seismicity thanks to the
fact that the predictable component of N has simple structure:

E(N(t + δ) − N(t) > 0 | At) =

π0(t − ti) · δ + λ∗δ,

Xt1<t

where the ti are events of N(dt) and At = {N(ds), s < t} is a past of the
process.

It is easy to see that the rate λ of the process N is bounded, if

λπ =

π0(t) dt < 1,

also,

Λ = λπ/(1 − λπ)

and λ = λ∗/(1 − λπ).

Statement 3. (a) The cluster rate function for the self-exciting model is

λ0(t) = π0(t) + π0 ∗ π0(t) + π0 ∗ π0 ∗ π0(t) + . . . ,

t > 0,

(12)

8

where ∗ denotes the convolution.

Let π0(t) be monotone near 0, where π0(t) ∼ At−p, 0 < p < 1. Then

λ0(t)/π0(t) ∼ 1,

t → 0.

Let π0(t) be monotone at ∞, where π0(t) ∼ Bt−1−θ, 0 < θ < 1. Then

λ0(t)/π0(t) ∼ (1 − λπ)−2,

t → ∞.

(b) The distribution density for τ as t → 0 has the form

∞

Z

pτ (t) = [(1 − λπ)λ0(t) +

λ0(x)λ0(x + t) dx + λ] · (1 + o(1)), t → 0. (13)

Let π0(t) be monotone near zero, where π(t) ∼ At−p, 0 < p < 1; let π0(t) <
ϕ(t) dt < 1, ϕ(t) ∼ ct−1−θ, t → ∞,
ϕ(t), where ϕ is a smooth function,

∞

0 < θ < 1. Then

pτ (t) = O(λ0(t)) as

t ↓ 0.

The time-magnitude self-exciting model. The self-exciting model is fre-
quently considered on the time-magnitude space as follows (see, e.g., [9]):
each event ti (both when a main or a cluster one) is ascribed a random
magnitude mi. The mi are independent for diﬀerent ti and have identcal
distributions with density p(m). The generation of clusters is that described
above, the only diﬀerence being that an event (s, m) generates a cluster
with rate q(m)π(t − s). It can be assumed without loss of generality that
q(m)p(m) dm = 1. This normalization preserves statements 1, 3 for the
self-exciting process (t, m) as well, independent of the choice of p(m) and
R
q(m). The function λ0(t) as given by (12) then corresponds to the cluster
rate when averaged over magnitude m. For purposes of seismology, p(m) cor-
responds to the normalized Gutenberg- Richter law, p(m) = βe−β(m−m0), m >
m0 while q(m) = eα(m−m0)(1 − α/β) is proportional to the size of the cluster
that has been triggered by an event of magnitude m.

4 The uniﬁed scaling law

According to [3], the distribution of τ depends on the single parameter λ,
see (1). The parameter λ is speciﬁed by the choice of the area and cutoﬀ
magnitude mc. This allows variation of λ in a very wide range. Experiments
which test (1) in [3] concern both the Earth as a whole and smaller or larger
areas of it. One can always select such areas in which seismicity is weakly
interdependent. For the theoretical analysis of the uniﬁed scaling law (1) one
may be interested in the following

Statement 4. Assume that it is possible to choose two regions G1 and G2
with independent stationary sequences of events Ni(dt). If the uniﬁed scaling
law (1) holds for G1, G2 and G1 ∪ G2 and f (x) < cx−θ, 0 < θ < 1 for small
x, then f (x) = exp(−x).

Proof. By (5),

pτ (t) =

∂2
λ∂t2 P {N(0, t) = 0},

(14)

where λ is the rate of N(dt) in the region. In virtue of (1)

pτ (t) = λf (λt).

Equation (14) and the initial conditions for P {N(0, t) = 0} = u(t) having the
form u(0) = 1 and u′(0) = −λ specify u(t) uniquely and yield u(t) = ϕ(λt),
where

ϕ(t) = 1 − t +

(t − s)f (s) ds

(15)

Since N1(dt) and N2(dt) are independent,

P (N(0, t) = 0) = P (N1(0, t) = 0)P (N2(0, t) = 0),

where N = N1 + N2 is the sequence of events for G1 ∪ G2. It follows that for
any t > 0 one has

t

Z
0

ϕ((λ1 + λ2)t) = ϕ(λ1t)ϕ(λ2t).

or

or

ψ(t) = ψ(pt) + ψ(qt)

(16)

where ψ(t) = ln ϕ(t), p = λ1/(λ1 + λ2) and p + q = 1. Iteration of (16) yields
for p = q = 1/2

ψ(t) = ψ(εnt)/εn,

εn = 2−n

ψ(t)
ψ(1)

=

ψ(εnt)
ψ(εn)

.

(17)

By ϕ(0) = 1, ϕ′(0) = −1 we have ψ(0) = 0 and ψ′(0) = −1. Using
L’Hospital’s rule we will have

lim
n→∞

ψ(εnt)
ψ(εn)

= lim
n→∞

ψ′(εnt)t
ψ′(εn)

= t.

By (17) one has ψ(t) = −αt or ϕ(t) = exp(−αt). However, in that case
f (x) = α2e−αx and
f (x) dx = 1, whence α = 1. Statement 4 is proven for
p = q = 1/2.

R

In the general case, p 6= 1/2, the iteration of (16) yields

where εk,n = pkqn−k.
As above one has

ψ(t) =

C k

nψ(εk,nt)

n

Xk=0

ψ(εk,nt) = ψ(εk,n)(t + δkn)

11

with δkn = o(1) as n → ∞.

Using (15) and the apriori bound

f (x) < cx−θ,

0 < θ < 1,

0 < x < ε

it is easy to show that

|δk,n| < kt · [max(p, q)]n(1−θ).

Therefore we have again ψ(t) = αt because δk,n are small uniformly in k.
The proof of the statement 4 is complete.

5 Conclusion

We have presented a theoretical analysis of the distribution of interevent
interval τ in a point process. It is shown that, when assumptions natural to
seismic events have been made, the distribution of τ may be a function of a
single parameter, the rate λ, provided the distribution is exponential. This
contradiction means that the nature of the empirical uniﬁed distribution of
τ is more complicated. One has to sepatate universal properties of τ from a
visual artiﬁcal eﬀects.

Making very general assumptions, we have found how the distribution of
τ behaves near 0 and ∞. As was to be expected [1], the behavior is related to
that of the Omori law near zero and to the Poisson character of main seismic
events, when one deals with asymptotics at inﬁnity. It is these asymptotics
which essentially make the probability density for τ ”universal” in [1], when
plotted on a log-log scale.

The parameterization of the distribution of τ put forward in [3] for λt >
0.05 has the form f (x) = cxγ−1 exp(−x/a).
It was shown above that the
parameter 1/a can be treated as the fraction of main events among all seismic
events. The estimate a = 1.23 derived in [3] yields a−1 ≈ 80%, which can
hardly be a universal constant. The main events in Italy are 60% among the
m ≥ 3.5 events (see [10]).

The factor xγ−1 is missing in the formula for f in the models consid-
ered above. This factor may be replaced (see (7)) by a factor of the type

12

exp(−cx1−θ), if the aftershock rate decays as a power function t−1−θ, 0 < θ ≤
1; the factor degenerates to a constant for θ > 1. Consequently, it remains
an open question as to what is the physical meaning of γ.

Appendix

Proof of Statement 1.
We are going to ﬁnd the asymptotics of P (τ > t) as t → ∞ using (7). To

do this, the following three limits should be found as t → ∞:

A := P (N(0, t) = 0) → P (N0(0, ∞) = 0) = P (τcl = 0).

Here, τcl is the cluster duration in N0.

B :=

P (N0(du) > 0, N0(u, u + t) = 0) →

P (τcl ∈ du) = P (τcl > 0).

Consequently, A + B → 1. It remains to ﬁnd the limit for the expression
under the exp sign in (7). One has

C : =

P (N0(u, t + u) > 0) du →

P (N0(u, ∞) > 0) du =

It remains to substitute the resulting limits into

P (τ > t) = exp{−λ∗(t + C)}[A + B]/(1 + Λ).

(18)

We now are going to prove the second part of Statement 1. Let Eτcl = ∞.
The asymptotics of C then calls for reﬁnement. One has

as follows from L’Hospital’s rule. Relation (7) stands proven.

Proof of Statement 2.
The distribution density for τ can be found by diﬀerentiating (18). To
do this, we make diﬀerences for the functions A, B, C in (18). One has for
small δ:

[A(t) − A(t + δ)]/δ = P (N(t, t + δ) > 0) δ−1(1 − P (N0(0, t) > 0 | N0{t} = 1)

≃ λ0(t)(1 + o(1)).

The last conclusion follows from the regularity requirement imposed on (8).
Similarly, one has for B(t) using (9):

[B(t) − B(t + δ)]/δ =

[P (N0(du) > 0, N0(u + t, u + t + δ) > 0) −

−P (N0(du) > 0, N0(u, u + t) > 0, N0(u + t, u + t + δ) > 0)] =

=

λ0(u)λu(t) du(1 + o(1)),

where λu(t) = P (N0(u + t + δ) − N0(u + t) > 0 | N0{u} = 1)/δ. One has
C ′(t) = −Λ(1 + o(1)) for C(t) using (8). It remains to diﬀerentiate (18) and
then to substitute the resulting asymptotic expressions for the derivatives A′,
B′, C ′ and the values A(0) = 1, B(0) = Λ and C(0) = 0.

Proof of Statement 3.
It follows from the description of the cascade generation of N0 that its

rate λ0(t) satisﬁes the integral equation

λ0(t) =

π0(x) λ0(t − x) dx + π0(t),

13 and Ch. 17, §12) yields conclusions of the form λ0(t)/π(t) → const as
t → 0 or t → ∞, respectively.

We now are going to prove (13). Consider the rate of a pair of events
in an N0 cluster: λ0(u, v) = P (N0(du) = 1, N0(dv) = 1)/(du dv), u < v.
Recalling that this is a cascade generation of N0, the states u and v in N0
can be derived in two ways. The one is when u and v have no common
parent except t = 0; the second is when u and v have a common parent z
If the common parent z for u
in the ﬁrst generation (a state of rank 1).
and v has rank r > 1, then the probability of that event will be of order
O((dz)2 du dv), which is negligibly small compared with O(dz du dv). This
consideration leads to the following equation for λ0(u, v):

λ0(u, v) = λ0(u)λ0(v) +

π0(z)λ0(u − z, v − z) dz,

u < v.

(20)

Put at(u) = λ0(u, u + t),

bt(u) = λ0(u)λ0(u + t). Then (20) gives

at(u) = bt(u) + π0 ∗ at(u).

Whence

at(u) = bt(u) + bt(u) ∗ (π0 + π0 ∗ π0 + π0 ∗ π0 ∗ π0 + . . .) =

= bt(u) + bt(u) ∗ λ0(u).

We are interested in the conditional rate in a N0 cluster:

λu(t) = λ0(u, u + t)/λ0(u).

One has from (21) using the notation at and bt:

λu(t) = λ0(u + t) +

λ0(x)λ0(x + t)λ0(u − x) dx/λ0(u).

It remains to substitute that expression in (10). One has

+ λ(1 + Λ)]/(1 + Λ) · (1 + o(1)),

t → 0.

However, (1 + Λ)−1 = 1 − λπ, so (13) is proved.

In order to have pτ (t) = O(λ0(t)) as t → 0 , one has to show that
λ0(u+t) < kλ0(t) for small t. To do this, we demand π0(t) = c1t−θ, 0 < t < ε
ϕ(t) < 1 and ϕ(t) ∼ ct−1−θ,
and π0(t) < ϕ(t). Here, ϕ is a smooth function,

t ≫ 1 with 0 < θ < 1; also, ϕ = π0 for t < ε. Then

R0

λϕ = ϕ + ϕ ∗ ϕ + ϕ ∗ ϕ ∗ ϕ . . .

is a smooth function. One has λ0(t) < λϕ(t) in virtue of (12), since π0 ≤ ϕ.
One has λϕ(t)/ϕ(t) → c as t → ∞ from the power law behavior of ϕ at ∞
(see Statement 3a). One also has λ0(t)/π0(t) → 1 as t → 0, hence λ0(t) ↑ ∞
as t → 0. Consequently, max
λ0(t) will coincide with λϕ(t0) = λ0(t0)(1+o(1))
t>t0

starting from some small t0. Hence

λ0(u + t) ≤ max
v>t0

λ0(v) ≤ max
v>t0

λϕ(v) ≃ λ0(t0)(1 + o(1)).

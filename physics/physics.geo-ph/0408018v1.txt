We invoke a metric to quantify the correlation between any two earthquakes. This provides a
simple and straightforward alternative to using space-time windows to detect aftershock sequences
and obviates the need to distinguish main shocks from aftershocks. Directed networks of earthquakes
are constructed by placing a link, directed from the past to the future, between pairs of events that
are strongly correlated. Each link has a weight giving the relative strength of correlation such that
the sum over the incoming links to any node equals unity for aftershocks, or zero if the event had
no correlated predecessors. Events can be aftershocks of many previous events, and also generate
many aftershocks. The probability distribution for the number of incoming and outgoing links
are both scale free, and the networks are highly clustered and modular. The Omori law holds for
aftershock rates with a decorrelation time that grows with the magnitude of the initiating shock.
Another scaling law is found for the fat-tailed distribution of distances between earthquakes and their
aftershocks, which extends over the range covered by the catalogue, or hundreds of kilometers, even
for intermediate magnitude events. This result is inconsistent with the hypothesis of aftershock
zone scaling, but consistent with observations of remote triggering. We also ﬁnd evidence that
seismicity is dominantly triggered by small earthquakes. This approach, using concepts from the
modern theory of complex networks, together with a metric to estimate correlations, opens up new
avenues of research, as well as new tools to understand seismicity.

I.

INTRODUCTION

quakes of magnitude m in a seismic region,

Seismicity is an exceedingly intermittent phenomena
[17] exhibiting strong correlations in space and time.
Since the seismic rate increases sharply after a large
earthquake in the region, events typically are classiﬁed
as aftershocks or main shocks, and the statistics of af-
tershock sequences are studied. Usually, aftershocks are
collected by counting all events within a ﬁxed space-time
window [7, 20, 21, 22] following a main event. The size of
the window may vary or scale with the magnitude of the
main event [18], and other reﬁnements have been made
[10]. However, this method does not allow a probability
to be deﬁned that an event thereby collected is actually
correlated to the main event under consideration. As a
result, no straightforward algorithm exists to decide if the
space-time windows are too large or too small for mini-
mizing errors in the procedure. Also, the method cannot
be easily extended to examine remote triggering [8, 12]
where main shocks may trigger aftershocks at great dis-
tance in space, or perhaps far away in time. In addition,
aftershocks may have several preceding events to which
they are correlated, perhaps with overlapping space-time
windows.

From a physical point of view, it appears arbitrary
to us to impose any space and time scales, associated
with aftershock collection windows, to a phenomena that
appears in many respects to exhibit scale-free statisti-
cal properties. One such property is the Gutenberg and
Richter [9] (G-R) distribution for the number of earth-

P (m) ∼ 10

−b m ,

(1)

with b usually ≈ 1. A second is the fractal appearance
of earthquake epicenters [13, 17, 28], where the fractal
dimension df ≈ 1.6 in S. California [6]. A third is the
Omori law [25, 30] for the rate of aftershocks in time,

ν(t) ∼

K
c + t

,

(2)

where c and K are constant in time, but depend on the
magnitude m [30] of the earthquake.

We [3] have previously introduced an alternative
method for characterizing seismicity that avoids all of
the above-mentioned problems and, at the same time,
makes available powerful concepts and methods that are
being developed to describe complex networks [1, 5, 23].
Here we extend the method to allow more than one in-
coming link per earthquake. This allows the network to
deviate from a tree structure and exhibit characteristic
properties of complex networks, such as “clustering”. It
also takes into account, in an unbiased way, that an af-
tershock can be correlated to many previous events. By
unbiased, we mean that we do not ﬁx any length, time
or magnitude scales for identifying aftershocks. Nor do
we ﬁx the number of events they can be aftershocks of.

II. THE METHOD

A general description of our method is as follows: The
ﬁrst step is to propose, as a null hypothesis [15], that
earthquakes are uncorrelated in time. Then we detect
instances when that hypothesis is strongly violated, in-
dicating that the opposite is true. The second step is
to assign a real number, or metric, that quantiﬁes the
correlation between any two earthquakes, based on gross
violations of the null hypothesis. The third step is to
construct a directed network where the events that are
correlated according to the metric are nodes connected
by links. Each link contains several variables such as the
time between the linked events, the spatial distance be-
tween their epicenter or hypocenters, the magnitudes of
the earthquakes, and the metric or correlation between
the linked pairs. We can study the statistical properties
of the network and its ensemble of space/time/magnitude
variables to gain new insights into seismicity. Note that
many variations of the null hypothesis and associated
metric are possible, but the key feature of a useful null
hypothesis, in this context, is that earthquakes are un-
correlated in time.

is
The null hypothesis, which we previously used,
that earthquakes occur with a distribution of magnitudes
given by the G-R law, with epicenters located on a frac-
tal of dimension df , at random in time. Of course, it is
patently false that earthquakes are uncorrelated in time.
The point is to look for strong violations of the null hy-
pothesis.

Consider an earthquake j in the seismic region, which
occurs at time Tj at location Rj. Look backward in time
to the appearance of earthquake i of magnitude mi at
time Ti, at location Ri. One can ask, how likely is event
i given that event j occurred where and when it did?
According to the null hypothesis, the expected number
of earthquakes of magnitude within an interval ∆m of
mi that would be expected to have occurred within the
time interval t = Tj − Ti seconds, and within a distance
l = |Ri − Rj| meters is

nij ≡ const t ldf ∆m 10

−bmi

.

(3)

Note that the space-time domain (t, l) appearing in Eq. 3
is selected by the particular history of seismic activity in
the region and not preordained by any observer. The
constant term in Eq. 3 is estimated by the overall seis-
mic rate in the region over the time span of recorded
events and is evaluated later. However, our results are
insensitive to the precise value of this constant, since its
value is absorbed into a threshold we deﬁne later, c<.

Consider a pair of earthquakes (i, j) where nij ≪ 1; so
that the expected number of earthquakes according to the
null hypothesis is very small. However, event i actually
occurred relative to j, which, according to the metric, is
surprising. Hence, it is unlikely that the pair would oc-
cur in that space-time domain if they were uncorrelated.

2

A small value nij ≪ 1 indicates that the correlation be-
tween j and i is very strong, and vice versa. By this ar-
gument, the correlation cij between any two earthquakes
i and j can be estimated to be inversely proportional to
nij, or

cij = 1/nij

.

(4)

As we show later, the distribution of the correlation vari-
ables cij for all pairs i, j is extremely broad. There-
fore, for each earthquake j, some exceptional events in
its past have much larger correlation than all the others.
These strongly correlated pairs of events can be marked
as linked nodes, and the collection of linked nodes forms
a sparse network of highly clustered graphs. In this work,
earthquakes are linked only if their correlation value, cij,
is greater than c< = 104, or the expected number of
events according to the null hypothesis, nij , is less than
10−4.

In the language of modern complex network theory
[1, 5, 23], a time-oriented network grows, where nodes
(earthquakes) have internal variables (magnitude, occur-
rence time, and location), and links between the nodes
carry a strength (the correlation cij) and are directed
from the older to the newer nodes. Empirically, we
ﬁnd that both the distribution of outgoing and incoming
links are scale free. The network is composed of highly
clustered, disconnected graphs of correlated earthquakes.
Events with incoming links, or aftershocks, typically con-
nect to many previous events rather than just one. How-
ever, the networks are sparse and the number of incom-
ing links to any node is much less than the total possible
number of links. Thus the correlation structure we ﬁnd
for seismicity is neither that every earthquake is corre-
lated to every other event, nor that events typically are
correlated to zero or one previous event, but a picture
in between where the number of events an aftershock is
correlated to is scale-free.

Due to the continuous nature of the link variable, cij,
no event is purely an aftershock or a main shock, and it is
not possible to separate events into distinct classes. This
is consistent with previous studies indicating no physical
distinction between main shocks and aftershocks [4, 14].
Note that singularities in Eq. 3 are eliminated by taking
a small scale cutoﬀ in time (here tmin = 60 sec) and a
minimum spatial resolution (here lmin = 100 meters).

III. DATA AND PARAMETERS

The

catalog we have

analyzed is maintained
by the Southern California Earthquake Data Cen-
ter, and can be downloaded via the Internet at
http://www.data.scec.org/ftp/catalogs/SCSN/. We use
data ranging from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 2003,
and follow a procedure similar to our previous work (see
Baiesi and Paczuski [3] for more details).

The relevant quantities for our present work are sum-
marized in Tables I, II, and III. Events with magnitude

smaller than m< = 3 are discarded, and ∆m = 0.1.
The number of earthquakes or nodes in the network con-
structed using the entire catalog is Nnode = 8858. The
b-value of the G-R law is b ≃ 0.95 for this data set, while
df ≃ 1.6 was found by Corral [6].

We consider two closely related variants of the met-
ric: in the two-dimensional (2D) version, the earthquake
depth is not considered, and the distance between two
events i and j is measured as the arc length on the Earth’s
surface,

lij = R0 arccos[ sin(θi) sin(θj) +

cos(θi) cos(θj) cos(φi − φj ) ]

, (5)

where the Earth radius is R0 = 6.3673 × 106 meters, and
(θi,φi) are the latitude and longitude, in radians, of the
epicenter of th i’th event in the catalogue.

The second version (3D) takes into account the depth
hi of each event. Hence Euclidean distances between
hypocenters are calculated,

and df in the metric is replaced by the hypocenter fractal
dimension Df , which is Df = df + 1 ≃ 2.6 for Southern
California. Thus, the 3D metric is

nij ≡ const’ t lDf ∆m 10

−bmi

.

(8)

Most of the statistical results we ﬁnd are not sensitive to
the choice of the metric, nor to the precise values of b,
df , or Df . For this reason, we pick as a standard metric
the 2D version (Eq. 3), and use the 3D metric only when
explicitly stated.

The constant in Eq. 3 was estimated to be const =
10−11 for the 2D metric using the same method as in

3

Baiesi and Paczuski [3]. However in that work a fractal
dimension of df = 1.2 was inadvertently used to estimate
const, resulting in a diﬀerent value. Similarly, here we
compute const’ = 10−15 for the 3D metric, Eq. (8). Both
values give consistent results, but they are not expected
to be precise due to the high variability of seismicity rates
in the region even over a time span of years. However,
varying the constants, const and const’, in our analysis is
equivalent to varying the correlation threshold for link-
ing events, c<. We observe that many of the statistical
results presented below are robust to variations of c<.

IV. RESULTS

Networks constructed using this method are shown
in Fig. 1. For comparison, networks obtained with the
2D metric [Fig. 1(a) and (b)] and with the 3D metric
[Fig. 1(c) and (d)] are both displayed. For visual clarity,
a higher threshold for earthquake magnitudes m< = 4
was used in order to reduce the number of nodes and
links in the ﬁgure. Adjusting the parameter c< slightly,
two networks with a similar number of links, with very
similar clusters of correlated events are formed. There is
a more abundant presence of long distance links in the 2D
version but the similar details in the Northridge clusters
[Fig. 1(b) and (d)] suggest that it is mainly seismic his-
tory that determines the network structure, rather than
the precise details of our metric.

FIG. 1: (a) Scale free network of earthquakes obtained with the 2D metric using m< = 4 and c< = 104. It has 791 nodes,
and its 7931 links follow the color code in the legend. Several clusters are evident, the biggest being related to the Landers
earthquake. The Northridge cluster, enclosed within a dashed box in (a), is enlarged in (b), where the solid black dot represents
the epicenter of the Northridge event. Figures (c) and (d) are obtained using the 3D metric with m< = 4 and c< = 5 × 103
giving 7947 links, very close to the number of links in the 2D version. Note that the networks found using these two diﬀerent
metrics are substantially similar, indicating the robustness of the method.

A. Explanation of Method

Fig. 2 shows the probability distribution of correlation
values, P (c), obtained by sampling the values cij over
all earthquake pairs in the data set. It is a fantastically
broad distribution that exhibits power law behavior over
sixteen orders of magnitude (in the 3D case):

P (c) ∼ c

−τ

(9)

with τ = 1.43 ± 0.03 using the 2D metric and τ = 1.38 ±
0.03 using the 3D one.

Given such a broad distribution, for any earthquake

j, some extreme events i exist whose correlation cij are
much larger than all the others. Therefore, it makes sense
to represent these earthquake pairs as nodes that are
linked, while not linking pairs that have much smaller
values of cij. Then the sequence of earthquakes may be
usefully represented as a sparse network, where links ex-
ist between the most strongly correlated events, i.e. those
pairs (i, j) where cij > c<. Hence a natural decomposi-
tion of the network into disconnected clusters is achieved,
where the ﬁrst earthquake in the directed cluster has no
incoming link, or correlation variable into it greater than
c<. Clearly, the ﬁrst earthquake in the entire catalogue
also no incoming link. The correlated events are reliably

detected when c< is greater than one but not extremely
large. In the latter case, correlated events detach, and a
very fragmented network appears. For small c< some un-
correlated events make links, and a giant cluster appears.
Both for the 2D and for the 3D case we set c< = 104, un-
less otherwise noted, obtaining a similar number of links
in the realization of the networks.

B. The Scale-Free Network

The resulting network of earthquakes is scale free. As
shown in Fig. 3, both the distribution of the number of
incoming links, or the “in-degree” kin, to a node and the
distribution of the number of outgoing links, or the “out-
degree” kout, to any node exhibit power law behavior,

P (kin) ∼ 1/kin , P (kout) ∼ 1/kout

(10)

up to a degree ≈ 100.

1. Aftershocks with more than one main shock

Since an earthquake can have more than one incoming
link, in attributing aftershocks to an event we must be
careful not to overweight aftershocks with many incom-
ing links. To prevent the overcounting of aftershocks,
one can consider a new event with two incoming links,
for example, to be “half an aftershock” of both of its
precursors, or they can be weighted in a diﬀerent fashion
according to their correlation values. In general, we can
attribute the relative correlation to previous events, so
that each event contributes a total weight of unity to the
global aftershock number if it is linked to at least one
previous event, and zero otherwise, as follows:

Here, the sum is over all of the outgoing links from event
i. In the limit that η → ∞, the extremal network stud-
ied by Baiesi and Paczuski [3] is recovered, since only the
single incoming link to aftershock j, with the largest cor-
relation cij, contributes. In that case, for each node, the
quantity Nafter discussed here coincides with the quan-
tity kout in Baiesi and Paczuski [3]. In the following, we
consider the case η = 1.

Sampling over all earthquakes, we get a probability
distribution for the number of (weighted) aftershocks
as also shown in Fig. 3.
It is a power law distribu-
tion, P (Nafter) ∼ (Nafter)−γ scaling over more than three
decades, with an index γ = 2.0(1). This distribution
is very close to the distribution we obtained previously
for the number of aftershocks in the extremal network,
corresponding to the limit η → ∞. At least for η ≥ 1,
the power law distribution for the number of weighted
aftershocks appears to be universal, in the sense that the
power law exponent does not depend on η.

2.

Is Seismicity driven by small or large earthquakes?

The average number of aftershocks of an earthquake of
magnitude m has been proposed to scale with m [16, 29]
as

Nafter(m) ∼ 10αm .

(13)

Larger main shocks release more energy and therefore
“trigger” more aftershocks than smaller earthquakes.
However, smaller earthquakes are more frequent, as in-
dicated by the G-R relation. The total number of after-
shocks generated by all earthquakes of magnitude m is
therefore given by the product of these two relations as

NTOT(m) = Nafter(m)P (m) ∼ 10(α−b)m .

(14)

If the exponent α > b then small earthquakes are the
dominant triggering mechanism for seismicity, whereas if
α < b the large earthquakes dominate aftershock produc-
tion. Often it is assumed that α = b [16, 27].

Recently, Helmstetter [10] analyzed earthquake cata-
logues by means of a ”stacking” method using space-time

FIG. 3: The in-degree and out-degree distributions of the net-
work of earthquakes and aftershocks. The out-degree, kout, is
the number of outgoing links from an earthquake, linking it to
its aftershocks. The in-degree, kin, is the number of incoming
links to an earthquake, linking it to its main shocks. These
two distributions are similar. Also shown is the distribution
of the weighted number of aftershocks, P (Nafter), from any
event, using η = 1 in Eqs. 11 and 12. This has the same
scaling behavior as the extremal network, with η → ∞.

shocks. For hkin(m)i there is no evident departure from the

suggests that small earthquakes are the dominant mech-
anism driving aftershock production. We determine the
value of the exponent α = 0.8, consistent with Helmstet-
ter’s previous ﬁndings. Thus at this rather detailed level,
results obtained using our method are consistent with
results obtained using traditional methods of aftershock
detection. This is true despite the fact that aftershocks
in our algorithm are typically attached to many previous
events rather than just one, and no space-time scales are
used by us for aftershock identiﬁcation.

Fig. 4 also shows the total number of links emanating
from events of magnitude m, Nout(m). This corresponds
to an unweighted aftershock number, with Nout(m) ∼
′−b) and α′ = 0.45. Since both α and α′ are less
10−(α
than b, our results suggest that irrespective of the man-
ner in which aftershocks are weighted, small earthquakes
are the dominant mechanism driving aftershock produc-
tion. Note however, that the largest events may appear
to present a deviation from this behavior, but the statis-
tical uncertainties of single events are large.

3. B˚ath’s Law

In Fig. 4, we also show the dependence of the number
of incoming links to a node on its magnitude. The quan-
tity hkin(m)i, is the average number of incoming links
to earthquakes of magnitude m. This quantity is inde-
pendent of earthquake magnitude for 3 ≤ m ≤ 5. For
larger magnitudes, the poor statistics forces us to av-
erage kin(m) over wider bins, chosen so that there is a
signiﬁcant number of events inside each one. These av-
erages are indicated as horizontal lines in Fig. 4, while
vertical lines denote the bin boundaries. The averages
do not show any detectable trend for larger earthquakes.
Our results suggest that earthquakes of all magnitudes
are equally likely to be aftershocks, and support the con-
clusion reached by Helmstetter and Sornette [11] that
observations of B˚ath’s law are due to biases in labelling
earthquakes as aftershocks. According to B˚ath’s law [2],
the average magnitude diﬀerence between a main shock
and its largest aftershock is around 1.2, independently
of the main shock magnitude. Of course, the deﬁnitions
we use here for main shocks, as nodes giving outgoing
links, and aftershocks, where nodes have incoming links
(so that a single event can be both a main shock and
aftershock), diﬀers from the standard deﬁnition.

4. Clustering of nodes

windows, and found that aftershocks were predominantly
triggered by small earthquakes. She determined the value
of the exponent α to be between α = 0.72 and α = 0.82,
depending on the parameters of the aftershock detection
algorithm that she used.

ric with η = 1. The results shown in this ﬁgure also

Among the concepts in network theory that may be
useful to characterize seismicity, and are not accessible
via other approaches, the clustering of nodes deserves
particular attention. Indeed, the clustering in space and
time of earthquakes can be quantiﬁed in their network
by the clustering coeﬃcient. The clustering coeﬃcient of
a node i is the number ∆i of linked triangles it forms

are joined to node i, or if no links between its linked
neighbors are present, while Ci = 1 only if all neighbors
are linked to each other.

we obtain C = 0.50 for m< = 3. This value is relatively
stable with respect to variations of m<. For instance,
with m< = 4.5 we get C = 0.55. The same values are
obtained for the 3D version of the metric. These are
remarkably high values of C, compared to many other
complex networks, such as technological or biological
ones [23].

5. Universal clustering properties of seismic networks

The average of the clustering coeﬃcient can be per-
formed over nodes with the same degree k. This quan-
tity is shown in Fig. 5, where one can observe that it does
not depend on k for small values of k and approaches a

7

power law C(k) ∼ k−δ with δ ≈ 1.3 for large values of
k. This power law behavior is typically found in net-
works with a modular structure [26]. At small k, C(k)
approaches a universal value approximately equal to 0.8,
which is independent of k and of the thresholds c< and
m< used to construct the network. The power law expo-
nent δ at large values of k also appears to be independent
of c<, and may also be a universal quantity for seismic
networks.

C. Scaling Law for Aftershock Distances

In the network constructed using the 2D metric, the
link length, l, is the distance between the epicenters of an
earthquake and one of its aftershocks, weighted according
to the link weight w. In the corresponding network con-
structed using the 3D metric, the link length is the dis-
tance between the hypocenters of an earthquake and one
of its aftershocks, weighted according to the link weight
w. The distribution Pm(l) of link lengths depends on the
magnitude m of the predecessor, being on average greater
for larger m. To compute this distribution, we put the
weight of each link into a bin corresponding to its l value
and the magnitude of the predecessor m to get Pm(l).
A maximum in the distribution occurs, which shifts to
larger l on increasing m, as shown in Fig. 6. This behav-
ior is superﬁcially consistent with using larger space-time
windows to collect aftershocks from larger events, or the
Kagan [18] hypothesis of aftershock zone scaling.

1. Comparison with Aftershock Zone Scaling

It is widely believed that an aftershock zone exists
which is equivalent to the rupture length. Within the
aftershock zone, earthquakes generate aftershocks, while
outside the zone they do not. The rupture length, R, is
believed to scale as R ∼ 100.5m with the magnitude of the
main shock. This is a restatement of the relation derived
by Kanamori and Anderson [19], who argued that the
seismic moment M ∼ 101.5m scales with R as M ∼ R3,
at least for intermediate magnitude earthquakes. For a
generalization to all earthquakes, see Kagan [18]. In this
scenario main shocks of all magnitudes generate after-
shocks at the same rate within their respective aftershock
zones, so that the greater number of aftershocks coming
from large events is due solely to their larger aftershock
zones. Needless to say, the observation of aftershock zone
scaling is based on the idea that the aftershock zone is
ﬁnite – on the order of tens of kilometers for large main
shocks.

In contrast, we ﬁnd the distribution of lengths between
main shocks and their aftershocks exhibits no cutoﬀ at
large distances, but rather decays slowly as a power law
with l, up to the linear extent of the seismic region cov-
ered by the catalog, hundreds of kilometers. The two

FIG. 6: Link length distribution for diﬀerent magnitudes of
the emitting earthquake, (a) for the 2D case and (b) for the
3D one. The length where the maximum in the distribution
occurs increases with magnitude roughly as lmax ∼ 100.37m in
both cases. Both distributions also have a fat tail, extending
up to hundreds of kilometers even for intermediate magnitude
events. These distributions are consistent with a hierarchical
organization of events, where big earthquakes preferentially
link at long distance with intermediate ones, which in turn
link to more localized aftershocks, and so on.

where l is measured in meters and F (x) is a scaling func-

ticular that σ 6= 0.5.

For x ≫ 1, the tail of the scaling function is a power
law, i.e. F (x) ∼ x−λ with λ ≈ 2 (2D) or λ ≈ 2.6
(3D). The results obtained using the data collapse tech-
nique applied using ansatz (17) are shown in the insets
of Fig. 6(a) and (b). Such slow decays at large distances
calls into question the use of sharply deﬁned space win-
dows for collecting aftershocks, as already pointed out
[24]. The length scale we ﬁnd l∗ ∼ 100.37m to

FIG. 7: The Omori law for aftershock rates. These rates are
measured for aftershocks linked to earthquakes of diﬀerent

the original Omori law, Eq. 2, up to a cutoﬀ time that depends

of Eq. 19 for m = 3, m = 4, and m = 5.

describe the fat-tailed distribution of distances between
earthquakes and their aftershocks should not be confused
with the scaling of a ﬁnite aftershock zone as proposed
by Kagan [18]. Instead, our results are consistent with
observations of remote triggering of aftershocks by Hill
et al. [12] and Gomberg et al. [8].

D. The Omori Law for Earthquakes of All
Magnitudes

Figure 7 shows the rate of aftershocks for the Landers,
Hector Mine, and Northridge events, obtained with the
2D metric. The weights, w, of the links to aftershocks
occurring at time t after one of these events are binned
into geometrically increasing time intervals. The number
of weighted aftershocks in each bin is then divided by the
temporal width of the bin to obtain a rate of weighted
aftershocks per second. The same procedure is applied
to each remaining event, not aftershocks of these three.
An average is made for the rate of aftershocks linked to
events having a magnitude within an interval ∆m of m.
Figure 7 also shows the averaged results for m = 3 (1871
events), m = 4 (175 events), m = 5 (28 events) and
m = 5.9 (4 events).

The collection of aftershocks linked to earthquakes
of all magnitudes is one of the main results of our
method. Even intermediate magnitude events can have
aftershocks that persist up to years. Earthquakes of all
magnitudes have aftershocks which decay according to
the Omori law [25, 30],

magnitude m [30] of the earthquake. We ﬁnd that the
Omori law persists up to a decorrelation time tcutoﬀ that
also depends on m.

A rough estimate of the decorrelation times can be
extracted by non-linear ﬁts of log10 νm(t) vs log10 t, using
an interpolating function

νm(t) ∼ t

.

(19)

The range of the ﬁt excludes short times, where the the
aftershock rates are not yet scaling as 1/t. The short time
deviation from power law behavior is presumably due to
saturation of the detection system, which is unable to
reliably detect events happening at a fast rate. However,
this problem does not occur at later times, where the
rates are lower. Some examples of these ﬁts are also
shown in Fig. 7 for the intermediate magnitude events.
In Fig. 8 we show the resulting values of tcutoﬀ, for m
up to 6. The horizontal dotted line represents the time
span of the catalogue we study, which precludes accurate
estimates of much longer tcutoﬀ . Thus, from the rates of
aftershocks of events with 3 ≤ m ≤ 4.6, where the time
span of the catalogue is comparable or longer than the
estimated decorrelation time, we ﬁnd that the increase of
tcutoﬀ with m can be ﬁtted by the function

tcutoﬀ (m) ≃ 105.25+0.74m sec

,

(20)

represented as a dashed line in Fig. 8.
It roughly cor-
responds to tcutoﬀ ≈ 11 months for m = 3, and to
tcutoﬀ ≈ 5 years for m = 4. An extrapolation yields
tcutoﬀ ≈ 1400 years for an event with m = 7.3 such as
the Landers event! However, we stress that Eq. 20 is just
rough estimate of tcutoﬀ(m).

Note that Helmstetter [10] also found an Omori law
for aftershocks of earthquakes of all magnitudes using
ﬁnite space-time windows. However, for this reason, she
was not able to estimate the decorrelation of aftershocks

9

or the cutoﬀ in the duration of the Omori regime for
diﬀerent magnitudes.

V. ROBUSTNESS WITH RESPECT TO
CHANGES IN PARAMETERS

At present, we are unaware of any reliable method
to determine the best metric. Thus, the best route at
present is to study how sensitive the results are to vari-
ations of the metric or to the parameters of the metric.
Although we have not yet made an exhaustive and de-
tailed study to determine which properties may be uni-
versal and hold for many diﬀerent metrics, several general
conclusions are already apparent.

Many of the statistical results we ﬁnd are relatively
robust with respect to variations in the metric. For in-
stance, using both the 2D metric (Eq. 3) and the 3D
metric (Eq. 8), similar networks are found as indicated
qualitatively in Fig. 1. In addition, the scaling behaviors
demonstrated in Figs. 2-7 are independent of the metric,
with the notable exception of the exponent λ character-
izing the fat tailed distribution of aftershock distances.
However, the exponent σ for the rescaled variable com-
bining main shock magnitude and aftershock distance is
independent of the metric, as is the Omori behavior. Fur-
thermore, the distribution of correlations P (c) depends
only weakly on the metric, and the scale-free and clus-
tering properties of the network are insensitive as well.

One could object that the values of b, df and Df can
depend on the region of the Earth being considered, or
may ﬂuctuate depending on the speciﬁc fault zone being
studied. However, the statistical results we ﬁnd, as shown
in the Figures, are also robust to variations in either of
these parameters, or of the threshold m<. This robust-
ness was also found in the Baiesi and Paczuski [3] stud-
ies of the extremal earthquake network. For instance,
varying df over a wide range, from 1 to 2 does not al-
ter considerably the distribution of incoming or outgoing
links. The distribution of correlations P (c), is even more
insensitive to variations of b and df . Also the Omori law
with p ≈ 1, shown in Fig. 7, does not depend sensibly
on the parameters, and holds for aftershocks linked to
earthquakes of all magnitudes.

Our interpretation of this observed robustness is that
the correlation structure of seismicity is unambiguous
and clear-cut, and has a network structure similar to
other complex networks. Even if we use an approximate
measure, or metric, the underlying correlations are suf-
ﬁciently strong that they survive the approximation and
can be reliably detected.

We propose a simple theory for the “universal” scaling law previously reported for the distributions
of waiting times between earthquakes. It is based on a largely used benchmark model of seismicity,
which just assumes no diﬀerence in the physics of foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks. Our
theoretical calculations provide good ﬁts to the data and show that universality is only approximate.
We conclude that the distributions of inter-event times do not reveal more information than what
is already known from the Gutenberg-Richter and the Omori power laws. Our results reinforces the
view that triggering of earthquakes by other earthquakes is a key physical mechanism to understand
seismicity.

Understanding the space-time-magnitude organization
of earthquakes remains one of the major unsolved prob-
lem in the physics of the Earth. Earthquakes are char-
acterized by a wealth of power laws, among them, (i)
the Gutenberg-Richter distribution ∼ 1/E1+β (with β ≈
2/3) of earthquake energies E [1]; (ii) the Omori law
∼ 1/tp (with p ≈ 1 for large earthquakes) of the rate of
aftershocks as a function of time t since a mainshock [2];
(iii) the productivity law ∼ Ea (with a . 2/3) giving the
number of earthquakes triggered by an event of energy
E [3]; (iv) the power law distribution ∼ 1/L2 of fault
lengths L [4]; (v) the fractal (and even probably multi-
fractal [5]) structure of fault networks [6] and of the set
of earthquake epicenters [7]. The quest to squeeze novel
information from the observed properties of seismicity
with ever new ways of looking at the data goes unabated
in the hope of better understanding the physics of the
complex solid Earth system. In this vein, from an analy-
sis of the probability density functions (PDF) of waiting
times between earthquakes in a hierarchy of spatial do-
main sizes and magnitudes in Southern California, Bak
et al. discussed in 2002 a uniﬁed scaling law combining
the Gutenberg-Richter law, the Omori law and the frac-
tal distribution law in a single framework [8] (see also
ref. [9] for a similar earlier study). This global approach
was later reﬁned and extended by the analysis of many
diﬀerent regions of the world by Corral, who proposed the
existence of a universal scaling law for the PDF H(τ ) of
recurrence times (or inter-event times) τ between earth-
quakes in a given region S [10, 11]:

H(τ ) ≃ λf (λτ ) .

(1)

The remarkable ﬁnding is that the function f (x), which
exhibit diﬀerent power law regimes with cross-overs, is
found almost the same for many diﬀerent seismic regions,
suggesting universality. The speciﬁcity of a given region

seems to be completely captured solely by the average
rate λ of observable events in that region, which ﬁxes the
only relevant characteristic time 1/λ.

The common interpretation is that the scaling law (1)
reveals a complex spatio-temporal organization of seis-
micity, which can be viewed as an intermittent ﬂow of
energy released within a self-organized (critical?) system
[12], for which concepts and tools from the theory of criti-
cal phenomena can be applied [13]. Beyond these general
considerations, there is no theoretical understanding for
(1). Under very weak and general conditions, Molchan
proved mathematically that the only possible form for
f (x), if universality holds, is the exponential function
[14], in strong disagreement with observations. Recently,
from a re-analysis of the seismicity of Southern Califor-
nia, Molchan and Kronrod [15] have shown that the uni-
ﬁed scaling law (1) is incompatible with multifractality
which seems to oﬀer a better description of the data.

Here, our goal is to provide a simple theory, which
clariﬁes the status of (1), based on a largely studied
benchmark model of seismicity, called the Epidemic-
Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model of triggered
seismicity [16] and whose main statistical properties are
reviewed in [17]. The ETAS model treats all earth-
quakes on the same footing and there is no distinction
between foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks: each
earthquake is assumed capable of triggering other earth-
quakes according to the three basic laws (i-iii) mentioned
above. The ETAS model assumes that earthquake mag-
nitudes are statistically independent and drawn from
the Gutenberg-Richter distribution Q(m). Expressed in
earthquake magnitudes m ∝ (2/3) ln10 E, the probabil-
ity Q(m) for events magnitudes mi to exceed a given
value m is Q(m) = 10−b(m−m0), where b ≃ 1 and m0
is the smallest magnitude of triggering events. We also
parametrize the (bare) Omori law for the rate of triggered

events of ﬁrst-generation from a given earthquake as
Φ(t) = θcθ/(c+t)1+θ, with θ & 0. Φ(t) can be interpreted
as the PDF of random times of independently occurring
ﬁrst-generation aftershocks triggered by some mainshock
which occurred at the origin of time t = 0. Several au-
thors have shown that the ETAS model provides a good
description of many of the regularities of seismicity (see
for instance Ref. [18] and references therein).

(according to (1) probability density functions (PDF) of the
recurrence times τ between successive earthquakes in various
regions of the world, scaled by their corresponding seismicity
rates λ. Top to bottom: the NEIC worldwide catalog for re-
gions with L ≥ 180 degrees, 1973-2002; NEIC with L ≤ 90

tom), Spain, 1993-1997, New Madrid, 1975-2002, and Great
Britain, 1991-2001. The PDFs have been translated for clar-
ity. The thin continuous lines are Corral’s ﬁts (12) while the
thick continuous lines are our prediction (11) based on ETAS
model with the parameters θ = 0.03, n = 0.9, a = 0.76 and
ρ = 1.

Our main result is the theoretical prediction (11) be-
low, which is used to ﬁt Corral’s data in Fig. 1, with re-
markably good agreement. According to Occam’s razor,
this suggests that the previously mentioned results on
universal scaling laws of inter-event times do not reveal
more information that what is already captured by the
well-known laws (i-iii) of seismicity (Gutenberg-Richter,
Omori, essentially), together with the assumption that
all earthquakes are similar (no distinction between fore-
shocks, mainshocks and aftershocks [19]), which is the
key ingredient of the ETAS model. Our theory is able
to account quantitatively for the empirical power laws
found by Corral, showing that they result from subtle
cross-overs rather than being genuine asymptotic scaling
laws. We also show that universality does not strictly
hold.

Our strategy to obtain these results is to ﬁrst calcu-

2

late the PDF of the number of events in ﬁnite space-time
windows [18], using the technology of generating proba-
bility functions (GPF), which is particularly suitable to
deal with the ETAS as it is a conditional branching pro-
cess. We then determine the probability for the absence
of earthquakes in a given time window from which, us-
ing the theory of point processes, is determined the PDF
of inter-event times. Our analysis is based the previous
calculations of Ref. [18], which showed that, for large ar-
eas (L ∼ tens of kilometers or more), one may neglect
the impact of aftershocks triggered by events that oc-
curred outside the considered space window, while only
considering the events within the space domain which are
triggered by sources also within the domain.

Generating probability functions of the statis-
tics of event numbers. Consider the statistics of the
number R(t, τ ) of events within a time window [t, t + τ ].
It is eﬃciently described by the method of GPF, deﬁned
by Θs(z, τ ) = hzR(t,τ )i where the brackets h.i denote a
statistical average over all possible realizations weighted
by their corresponding probabilities. We consider a sta-
tistically stationary process, so that Θs(z, τ ) does not
depend on the current time t but only on the window
duration τ . For the ETAS model, statistical stationarity
is ensured by the two conditions that (i) the branching
ratio n (or average number of earthquakes/aftershocks
of ﬁrst-generation per earthquake) be less than 1 and (ii)
the average rate ω of the Poissonian distribution of spon-
taneous events be non-zero. The GPF Θs(z, τ ) can then
be obtained as [18]

where Θ(z, t, τ ) is the GPF of the number of aftershocks
triggered inside the window [t, t + τ ] (t > 0) by a sin-
gle isolated mainshock which occurred at time 0 and
Θ(z, τ ) = Θ(z, t = 0, τ ). The ﬁrst (resp. second) term in
the exponential in (2) describes the contribution of after-
shocks triggered by spontaneous events occurring before
(resp. within) the window [t, t + τ ].

Ref. [18] previously showed that Θ(z, t, τ ) is given by

Θ(z, t, τ ) = G[1 − Ψ(z, t, τ )] ,

where G(z) is the GPF of the number of ﬁrst-generation

To make progress in solving (3,4,5), let us expand G(z)

in powers of z:

G(z) = 1 − n + nz + β(1 − z)γ + ... ,

(7)

where γ = b/α (where α = (3/2)a < 1 is the productivity
exponent when using magnitudes) and β = nΓ(2−γ)(γ −
1)γ−1/γγ. While we can calculate the looked-for distri-
bution of recurrence times using the shown expansion up
to order (1 − z)γ, it turns out that truncating (7) at the
linear order is suﬃcient to explain quantitatively Corral’s
results, as we show below. Using G(z) = 1 − n + nz has
the physical meaning that each earthquake is supposed to
generate at most one ﬁrst-generation event (which does
not prevent it from having many aftershocks when sum-
ming over all generations). Indeed, interpreted in proba-
bilistic term, G(z) = 1 − n + nz says that any earthquake
has the probability 1 − n to give no oﬀspring and the
probability n to give one aftershock (of ﬁrst-generation).
This linear approximation is bound to fail for small re-
currence times associated with the large productivity of
big earthquakes and, indeed, we observe some deviations
for the shorter recurrence times below several minutes
as discussed below. The linear approximation is not in-
tended to describe the statistics of very small recurrence
times within clusters of events triggered by large main-
shocks, but is approprioate for “quiet” periods of seismic
activity. The linear approximation is expected and ac-
tually seen to work remarkably well for large recurrence
times of hours, days, weeks...

The linear approximation bypasses much of the com-
plexity of the nonlinear integral equations (3,4) to obtain
0 Ψ(t, τ )dt = A(τ )
1−n . Expression (6) becomes (for τ ≫ c)

The average seismicity rate λ is given by λ = ω
1−n , which
renormalizes the average rate ω of spontaneous sources
by taking into account earthquakes of all generations trig-
gered by a given source: λ = ω + nω + n2ω + .... Due to
the assumed statistical independence between event mag-
nitudes, the proportion between spontaneous observable

events and their observable aftershocks does not depend
on the magnitude threshold and the above expression for
the average seismic rate holds also for observable events
at diﬀerent magnitude thresholds of completeness. Fi-
nally, λ0 is the average seismic rate within a spatial do-
main S0 of reference with linear size L0, and ρ takes into
account the dependence on the magnitude threshold m
for observable events and on the scale L of the spatial
domain S used in the analysis. The ﬁrst term (1 − n)x
in the exponential of (8) describes the exponential de-
creasing probability of having no events as τ increases
due to the spontaneous occurrence of sources. The other
term proportional to x1−θ takes into acount the inﬂu-
ence through Omori’s law of earthquakes that happened
before the time window.

Statistics of recurrence times. Consider a sequence
of times {ti} of observable earthquakes, occurring inside
a given seismic area S. The inter-event times are by def-
inition τi = ti − ti−1. The whole justiﬁcation for the cal-
culation of Ps(τ ) lies in the well-known fact in the theory
of point processes [20] that the PDF H(τ ) of recurrence
times τi is given by the exact relation

H(τ ) =

Substituting (8) in this expression yields our main theo-
retical prediction for the PDF of recurrence times, which
is found to take the form (1) with

While our theoretical derivation justiﬁes the scaling re-
lation (1) observed empirically [10, 11], the scaling func-
tion f (x) given by (11) is predicted to depend on the
criticality parameter n, the Omori law exponent θ, the
detection threshold magnitude m and the size L of the
spatial domain S under study. While θ might perhaps
be argued to be universal, this is less clear for n which
could depend on the regional tectonic context. The sit-
uation seems much worse for universality with respect
to the two other parameters m and L which are catalog
speciﬁc. It thus seems that our prediction can not agree
with the ﬁnding that f (x) is reasonably universal over
diﬀerent regions of the world as well as for worldwide
catalogs [10, 11].

It turns out that the dependence on the idiosynchratic
catalog-dependent parameters m and L is basically irrel-
evant as long as θ is small and n in the range 0.7 − 1
previously found to be consistent with several other sta-
tistical properties of seismicity [18, 21]. Note that the
condition that θ be small is fully compatible with many
empirical studies in the literature for the Omori law re-
porting an observable (renormalized) Omori law decay

∼ 1/t0.9−1 corresponding to θ = 0 − 0.1 [17]. Fig. 2
shows the changes of f (x) when varying the magnitude
threshold from 0 to 3. These changes of f (x) seem to
be within the inherent statistical uncertainties observed
in empirical studies [10, 11]. The technical origin of the
robustness lies in the fact that, for θ = 0.03 say, chang-
ing m − m0 from 0 to 6 amounts to changing ρ from 1
(m = m0) to ρ = 10−6 (m = m0 + 6) which changes ρθ
from 1 to only ρθ ≃ 0.66. We conclude that our theory
provides an explanation for both the scaling ansatz (1)
and its apparent universal scaling function.

−3. In
corresponding to a thousand-fold variation of ρ = 1; 10
these synthetic examples, we assume that the spatial domain
S0 corresponds to an average seismicity rate λ0 ≃ 1 per day,
that the characteristic time scale of the Omori law is c ≃ 10
−4. Then, for θ ≃ 0.03, we have a ≃
sec., so that λc ≃ 10
0.76. The obtained function f (x) is compared with Corral’s
empirical ﬁtting function fc(x) deﬁned in (12) with g = 0.7,
δ = 1.05, d = 1.7 and C = 0.78. The dashed lines are the
power laws ∼ x−0.3 and x−1.

We can squeeze more out of (11) to rationalize the
empirical power laws reported by Corral. In particular,
Corral proposed the following empirical form for f (x)
which, in our notations, reads

fc(x) =

Cδ

(12)

where g = 0.67±0.05, δ = 1.05±0.05, d = 1.64±0.15, and
C ensures normalization [10, 11]. Fig.2 shows indeed that
expression (12) with Corral’s reported parameter values
for g, δ and d ﬁts (11) remarkably well quantitatively.
While the intermediate asymptotics f (x) ∼ xγ−1 ≃ x−0.3
proposed by Corral is absent from our theoretical expres-
sion (11), it can actually be seen as a long cross-over
between the power and exponential factors in (11), as
shown by one of the dashed lines in Fig.2.

Interestingly, expressions (11) and (12) depart from
each other for x . 0.01. Our theoretical distribution

4

f (x) has the power law asymptotic f (x) ∼ x−1, which is
a direct consequence of Omori’s law described explicitly
by the ﬁrst power law factor in front of the exponential
in (11). It is absent from expression (12). However, its
presence is clear in real data as shown in Fig. 1 extracted
from [11] on which we have superimposed our theoreti-
cal prediction (11). Note that expression (11) exhibits
a slight departure from the data for small x’s (deﬁned
in (9)), which can be attributed to the linearization of
(7), which amounts to neglecting the renormalization of
the Omori law by the cascade of triggered aftershocks
[17]. Taking into account this renormalization eﬀect by
the higher-order terms in the expansion (7) improves the
ﬁt to the data shown in Fig. 1. Our detailed study shows
that comparing (11) with data provides constraints on
the parameter n: the data deﬁnitely excludes small val-
ues of n and seems best compatible with n = 0.7 − 1, in
agreement with previous constraints [18] suggesting that
earthquake triggering is a dominant process.

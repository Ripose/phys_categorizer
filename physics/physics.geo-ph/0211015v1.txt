Abstract. The GPS performance is impaired in conditions of geomagnetic

distrubances. The rms error of positioning accuracy increases in the case where

two-frequency GPS receivers of three main types (Ashtech, Trimble, and AOA)

are in operation. For Ashtech receivers (unlike AOA and Trimble) there is also a

clear correlation between the slip density of the one- and two-frequency modes of

positioning and the level of geomagnetic disturbance.

1. Introduction

The satellite navigation GPS system [Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 1992] has

become a powerful factor of scientiﬁc and technological progress worldwide, and

enjoys wide use in a great variety of human activity. In this connection, much

attention is given to continuous perfection of the GPS system and to the widening of

the scope of its application for solving the navigation problems themselves, as well

as for developing higher-precision systems for time and accuracy determinations.

Even greater capabilities are expected in the near future through the combined use

of the GPS with a similar Russian system GLONASS [Kharisov et al., 1998].

The performance of modern global satellite radio navigation systems that

utilize the ”Earth-Space” radio wave propagation channel is limited considerably

by the inﬂuence of the geospace environment. Furthermore, the main contribution

comes from systematic ionospheric eﬀects of radio wave propagation: the group

and phase delay, the frequency Doppler shift, and the rotation of the plane of

polarization (Faraday eﬀect). In many instances the degree of manifestation of the

above eﬀects has only a weak dependence on the local distribution of electronic

density in the ionosphere but is directly correlated with the value of total electron

content (TEC) along the radio signal propagation path [Goodman and Aarons,

1990].

In undisturbed geospace conditions the main contribution to the formation of

the above-mentioned ionospheric eﬀects is made by the regular TEC component.

It undergoes periodic regular variations (seasonal-diurnal, latitudinal, and

longitudinal) and is relatively accurately predictable. A variety of TEC models

have been developed to date, which are intended to cancel out the ionospheric

inﬂuence on the performance of the modern GLONASS and GPS in geomagnetically

quiet and weakly disturbed conditions [Afraimovich et al., 2000a; Klobuchar, 1986].

The situation with geomagnetically disturbed geospace is more complicated.

The irregular TEC component makes a substantial contribution in this case. The

amplitude of random TEC variations with a period from a few minutes to several

hours in conditions of geomagnetic disturbances can make up as much as 50% of

the background TEC value [Basu et al., 1988; Bhattacharrya et al., 2000; Ho et al.,

4

1996; Shaer et al., 1997; Warnart, 1995]. Furthermore, the amplitude and phase

ﬂuctuation range of signals from navigation satellites (NS) at the reception point

can exceed the designed level corresponding to the uninterrupted operation of GPS

receivers. This leads to the degradation of the determination accuracy of a current

location (CL) of stationary and mobile users of GPS. Furthermore, there might

occur a break-down in tracking the NS signal in phase (code) one of the working

frequencies and, hence, a failure in the determination of the coordinates in the one-

or two-frequency mode.

The study of deep, fast variations in TEC caused by a strong scattering of

satellite signals from intense small-scale irregularities of the ionospheric F 2-layer at

equatorial and polar latitudes has a special place among ionospheric investigations

based on using satellite (including GPS) signals [Aarons, 1982; Basu et al., 1988;

Aarons et al., 1996, 1997; Pi et al., 1997; Aarons and Lin, 1999].

Recent years saw extensive studies of phase ﬂuctuations and phase slips

of range measurements using GPS in conditions of geomagnetic disturbances

[Afraimovich et al., 2000; 2000a; 2001; 2001a; 2002; 2002a; Bhattacharrya et al.,

2000; Skone and Jong, 2000; Coster et al., 2001; Shan et al., 2002]. From the

point of view of the GPS user, however, of signiﬁcantly greater interest are the

investigations into the inﬂuence of geomagnetic disturbances on the performance of

GPS as a positioning system.

The objective of this paper is to estimate the CL determination accuracy

and the failure density in determining the location in the one-frequency and

two-frequency modes in conditions of geomagnetic disturbances for GPS receivers

installed at permanent mid-latitude stations forming part of the global GPS

network.

2. Experimental setup and data processing technique

In conducting the experiment in order to investigate the GPS performance in

conditions of geomagnetic disturbances, we intended

- to estimate the CL determination accuracy of the GPS user in conditions of

geomagnetic disturbances as compared to undisturbed conditions; and

5

- to establish the fact of presence (absence) of slips in the determination of the

user’s location in the one-frequency mode of standard accuracy and in the mode of

two-frequency positioning in conditions of geomagnetic disturbances, and to obtain

a numerical estimate of the slip density.

We used, as input experimental data, RINEX-ﬁles [Gurtner, 1993] available

through the Internet at http://lox.ucsd.cdu/cgi-bin/allCoords.cgi. Of them, we

considered the data from the set of stations forming part of the global GPS network
(GPS stations) in the mid-latitude region (latitudes B - 35...50◦, longitudes L
-120...90◦) in North America where the distribution density of stations is the largest

(the location map of GPS stations is presented in Fig.1). We did not consider the

equatorial and polar regions.

Three days were used in the experiment: one quiet day (July 12, 2000, day

number in the year 194), and two magnetically disturbed days (July 15 and August

12, 2000, day numbers 197 and 225, respectively) when strong magnetic storms

occurred.

It is pointed out in [Afraimovich et al., 2000; 2000a; 2001; 2001a; 2002;

2002a] that geomagnetically disturbed conditions show a diﬀerent response of

two-frequency receivers manufactured by diﬀerent ﬁrms. Thus, the lowest phase

slip density of range measurements at the working frequencies f1 and f2 was

observed for Ashtech receivers, a moderate density for Trimble, and the highest

density for AOA. In this connection, our experiment was conducted with regards

to GPS receivers of these types. Table 1 presents general information about the

experiment: date; maximum level of geomagnetic disturbance characterized by the

maximum value of the geomagnetic index −Dstmax, nT, for 24 hours; GPS station

name and location, and the name of the receiver installed at a given station.

The goal of the ﬁrst stage of GPS data processing in this paper is

to reconstruct the current location on the basis of available RINEX ﬁles

using software product TEQC posted by its developers on the Internet at:

http : //unavco.ucav.edu/data − support/sof tware/teqs/tewc.html which we

updated to ease the experiment.

In order to carry out investigations into the above-mentioned issues, we

6

developed software package ”Navigator” to perform the following functions:

- automated start of software product TECQ in the package mode by setting

up a current command line of the form: teqc.exe + qc = stY Y mmddhh/MMSS +

dh∆t − navsitesddd0.Y Y nsitesddd0.Y Y o, where teqc.exe is the executed ﬁle of

software product TEQC; qc, st, and dh are the control options in the command

line; Y Y , mm, dd, MM, and SS are the year, month, day, hour, minute, and

second for which the coordinates of the object are calculated with a current start

of TEQC; ∆t is the time step of calculation of the coordinates on the interval of

observation (in fractions of an hour); and sites is the abridged name of the GPS

station, to which the RINEX-ﬁles of format ”o” (observation) and ”n” (navigation)

refer.

- setting up of the output data ﬁle in the format:

ti; Xi; Yi; Zi; Li; Bi; Hi; ∆Xi; ∆Yi; ∆Zi; ∆Li; ∆Bi; ∆Hi, where ti is a current

time (in hours and in fractions of an hour); Xi, Yi, and Zi are current rectangular

geocentric coordinates (in meters); Li, Bi, and Hi are current geocentric coordinates;

and ∆Xi; ∆Yi; ∆Zi; ∆Li; ∆Bi; ∆Hi are absolute current errors of determination of

the corresponding rectangular and geocentric coordinates.

- detecting the slips of the one- and two-frequency mode of positioning, and

determining the corresponding slip density;

- estimating the current and daily mean spherical standard deviations of CL

determination for the GPS station.

following data are speciﬁed:

The software package is controlled through the interactive ﬁle in which the

- name of GPS station sites; - form of the command line (if necessary, the

form of the command line can be changed); - date (day, month, day); - start and

end time of the period of observation (in hours, minutes and seconds); - size of the

time step of calculation of the current coordinates (∆t: from 0.018 to 24 hours); -

direction of count time increment – toward increasing (+dh) or decreasing (−dh),

respectively; - ON- (OFF-) option of the block of analyzing the slip density and the

stands deviations of CL determination.

As a result of the ﬁrst stage of processing, for each GPS station from Table 1 we

7

reconstructed for three days (194, 197, and 225) of the year 2000 the diurnal series

of rectangular geocentric coordinates Xi; Yi; Zi; at time steps of 1.2 minute (the

minimum possible steps when using the TEQC package), and the corresponding

absolute errors:

∆x=xi − x0; ∆y=yi − y0; ∆z=zi − z0,

where x0, y0, z0 are the known coordinates of the GPS station, and i is the

time count number.

The second stage of data processing involved estimating the current CL

determination accuracy that is equal to the value of the spherical standard

deviation (SD) in the determination of the coordinates σ(ti), m:

σ(ti) = (σxi + σyi + σzi)0.5,

where σxi, σyi, σzi are the SD in the determination of the corresponding

coordinate in a rectangular geocentric coordinate system. Current values of σ(ti)

were calculated for each 3.6-minute interval over the length of the entire diurnal

series.

In addition, for a generalized estimation of the determination accuracy of the

coordinate of each station in particular geomagnetic conditions, we calculated the

daily mean values of the spherical SD σ, m. Results of this processing are plotted

as σ(t) in Figs.2,3,4,5,6,7 are presented as histograms for σ (Fig.8).

The third stage of data processing included estimating the slip density in the

determination of the CL for receivers of three types (Ashtech, AOA, and Trimble)

in the one- and two-frequency modes. In the analysis of the slip intensity in the

determination of the coordinates in the one-frequency mode, the slip was considered

to mean the event implying that the following condition is satisﬁed:

σ(t) ≤ Π = 500 m

We deduced empirically the value of the unacceptable error threshold Π = 500

m, based on the fact that the best determination accuracy of CL is required for

most practical purposes [Skone and Jong, 2000].

By the slip in the mode of two-frequency determination of the coordinates was

meant the event implying that at a current instant of time, more than 30% of all

observed NS of the constellation do not provide tracking at the auxiliary working

8

frequency f2.

As the characteristic of the slip intensity of the one- and two-frequency

mode of coordinate determination, we calculated the current slip densities of

the one- and two-frequency modes (N1 and N1,2, respectively). The current slip

density N1 and N1,2 was determined as the total number of slips on each 0.5-hour

interval. Results of this processing are presented as plots of the diurnal slip density

distribution for the one-frequency mode (Fig.10,11,12), and for the two-frequency

mode (Fig.13,14,15).

Furthermore, we also determined the total diurnal slip density Ns for the one-

and two-frequency modes, for each station and for each of the days listed in Table

1. Results of this processing are represented by the histograms in Figs.9 and 16,

respectively.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. The magnetically quiet day of July 12, 2000

Fig.2 (panels b,c,d) and Fig.3 (b,c) plot the time dependencies of the spherical

standard deviations σ(t) in the CL determination on the magnetically quiet day

of July 12, 2000, obtained at three diﬀerent sites: Kew1, Stb1, and Chb1 with

the Ashtech receivers, and at sites Upsa (Trimble) and Algo (AOA). Table 2

presents the corresponding daily mean values of σ. On some of the panels where

the maximum values of standard deviations far exceeded the daily mean values,

these values of the maximum diurnal standard deviation σmax are included in Table

2 and removed from the ﬁgures to ease the reading. A more general picture of

the daily mean values of standard deviations for all types of receivers for the days

analyzed in this paper is provided by the Fig.8 histograms. In this ﬁgure, each type

of receiver under investigation is represented by a set of three stations. Ashtech is

represented on panel a) by the sites Kew1, Stb1, and Chb1; AOA is represented on

panel b) by the sites Algo, Gode, and Usno; and Trimble is represented on panel c)

by the sites Tung, Dyer, and Upsa.

It is evident from the ﬁgures and histograms presented here that in magnetically

quiet conditions the CL determination accuracy that is provided by the Ashtech

9

and AOA receivers diﬀers only slightly (for Ashtech σ ≤ 46 m, and for AOA σ ≤ 33

m). Single abrupt changes of the current values of σ(ti) over the course of 24 hours

occur for the three types of receivers (Table 2). Furthermore, their maximum

values do not diﬀer greatly σmax ≤ 249 m for Ashtech; σmax ≤ 256 m for AOA, and

σmax ≤ 243 m for Trimble.

As regards the number of slips in the coordinate determination in the

one-frequency mode under quiet geomagnetic conditions, and Ashtech and AOA

receivers also showed about the same level. Thus, no more than three slips of

the one-frequency mode and no more than two slips were observed for 24 hours,

respectively for Ashtech (site Kew1) and AOA (site Gode). For the Trimble

receiver, this ﬁgure was worse and reached ten slips for 24 hours (site Tung). On

the other hand, the three types of receivers at some of the sites did not show any

slips of the one-frequency mode for 24 hours (see Fig.9). All observed slips occurred

before 12 UT.

(see Fig.13).

The performance of the Trimble receivers in the two-frequency mode of

coordinate determination in the magnetically quiet situation was also worse when

compared with Ashtech and AOA. Thus, for the receivers of the two last types, no

slip of the two-frequency mode was recorded for all the sites under consideration

3.2. The magnetic storms of July 15 and August 12, 2000

In general, the period of geomagnetic disturbances showed a degradation of

the accuracy and quality of GPS performance for the three types of receivers.

During the July 15 magnetic storm there was an increase of the value of

the daily mean spherical standard deviation in the CL determination σ, m. The

corresponding maximum values were as follows: 76 m for the Ashtech receiver (site

Kew1); 39 m for AOA (site Algo), and 120 m for Trimble (site Upsa). Thus the

value of σ increased (compared to geomagnetically quiet conditions) by a factor of

1.6-1.7 for Ashtech, and by a factor of 1.1-1.2 for AOA and Trimble (for the sites

Algo and Upsa, respectively). The estimates made here and Figs.3,6 and 8 suggest

also the conclusion that the Ashtech receivers were the most sensitive to a change

10

of the geomagnetic situation. Values of the spherical SD in the CL determination

using the AOA and Trimble receivers do not increase as signiﬁcantly as above and

can, in some cases, also be lower than those in geomagnetically quiet conditions

(Fig.8 (a-c)).

c), and 8).

A similar picture is also observed during the magnetic storm of August 12,

2000; however, the eﬀect is more fully manifested. There was an unambiguous

increase of the values of σ for the three types of receivers and for all sites when

compared with magnetically quiet conditions. Values of σ increased by a factor of

1.6-2.6, 1.3-2.1 and 1.02-1.4 for Ashtech, AOA and Trimble (Fig.4 (b, c, d); 7 (b,

Table 2 presents the maximum values of single abrupt changes of current

values of the spherical SD in the CL determination σ(ti) for the 24 hours that are

analyzed. For the Ashtech and Trimble receivers, there is also a consistent tendency

of the values of these abrupt changes to increase in geomagnetically disturbed

conditions. Figs.3 (b, c); 4 (b, c, d) induce us also to suggest that for Ashtech

the intervals with the largest number of abrupt changes of current values of σ(ti)

correspond to the time period of the highest level of geomagnetic ﬁeld disturbance.

However, to conﬁrm this assumption requires an extensive set of observations.

On the basis of studying the slip density and localization of the one- and

two-frequency modes in the CL determination, the following features were

established.

Firstly, we identiﬁed an unambiguous tendency of the slip density of the

one-frequency mode to increase in magnetic storm conditions for the Ashtech and

Trimble receivers. Compared to magnetically quiet conditions, the slip density of

the one-frequency mode increased by a factor of 2.5 and 1.4-8 for Ashtech and

Trimble, respectively (Fig.9, Figs.10 (b, d); 11 (b, d); 12 (b, d)).

Secondly, for the Ashtech receiver the localization of slips of the one-frequency

mode along the time axis corresponds to the time period of maximum geomagnetic

ﬁeld disturbance (Figs.11b; 12b). The sole exception was the Ashtech receiver at

the site Chb1. No slips of the one-frequency mode was recorded for this site for any

one of the days under consideration.

11

Thirdly, we detected a clearly pronounced tendency of the slip density of the

two-frequency mode in the CL determination to increase for the Ashtech receivers

in geomagnetically disturbed conditions. Thus, while no slips were observed for the

magnetically quiet day of July 12, at periods of geomagnetic disturbances their

diurnal number varied from 40 (site Stb1, August 12) to 120 (site Kew1, July 15) –

Fig.16.

Besides, there was a clear localization of the two-frequency mode for the time

interval corresponding to the maximum level of geomagnetic ﬁeld disturbance

(Figs.14 (a, b) and 15 (a, b)). A similar, but less clearly pronounced, tendency of

the slip density of the two-frequency mode to increase was also identiﬁed for the

Trimble receivers (Fig.16b). We recorded no slips of the two-frequency mode in

magnetic storm conditions for the AOA receivers in all cases that were considered.

Thus our investigation has shown that geomagnetic disturbances of geospace

are accompanied by a degradation of the accuracy and quality of GPS performance.

During geomagnetic disturbances of geospace the Earth’s ionosphere becomes

essentially inhomogeneous. The dramatic irregular geospace variations during

geomagnetic disturbances are associated with the generation in the ionosphere of a

broad spectrum of irregularities giving rise to the scattering and defocusing of the

satellite signal.

As a result, receivers can observe signiﬁcant signal amplitude ﬂuctuations

capable of causing the break-down of its tracking. Besides, the presence of irregular

electron density irregularities along the radio signal propagation path is responsible

for the proportionate ﬂuctuations of the group and phase delay [Yakovlev, 1996]

which degrade the accuracy of CL determination. Abrupt ﬂuctuations of the phase

delay can also cause the breakdown of NS signal tracking if the frequency Doppler

shift of the received signal exceeds the frequency bandwidth of the tracking contour

in phase.

As has been shown above, slips of the two-frequency mode of coordinate

determination are a more common phenomenon compared with slips of the

one-frequency mode. The main reason for this might be the fact that the signal

level at the auxiliary (closed) frequency f2 is lower than that at the fundamental

12

frequency f1. The received power, with the elevation angle of the ray to the NS of
45◦, is 159 Db/W at the frequency f1, and 166 Db/W at the closed frequency f2

[Interface Control Document; Langley, 1998]. As far as the diﬀerences between the

response of the particular types of GPS receivers to geomagnetic disturbances of

geospace are concerned, this issue still remains open and is beyond the scope of this

paper. To elaborate on this question requires analyzing the design and functional

features of receivers manufactured by diﬀerent ﬁrms.

4. Conclusion

Main results of this study are as follows:

1. In geomagnetically disturbed conditions of geospace the accuracy and quality

of GPS performance is impaired.

2. Unlike geomagnetically quite conditions, the magnetic storm conditions

are accompanied by an increase of the spherical standard deviation in the

location determination for all types of GPS receivers. Furthermore, there was

a maximum increase of the values of σ by a factor of 2.6, 2.1 and 1.4 for the

Ashtech, AOA and Trimble receivers, respectively.

3. In magnetic storm conditions there is an increase of the number of slips of the

one-frequency mode of coordinate determination. The slip density increased

by a factor of 2.5, 8 and 12 for the Ashtech, Trimble and AOA receivers,

respectively (site Usno).

4. We have identiﬁed an unambiguous tendency of the slip density of the

one-frequency mode to increase for the Ashtech and Trimble GPS receivers,

respectively. For the AOA receivers this tendency was observed not in all

cases that were considered.

5. The slip density in the two-frequency mode of coordinate determination

in magnetic storm conditions increases most dramatically for the Ashtech

receivers (from 0 to 120 slips). As regards the Trimble receivers, there is a

similar, but less clearly pronounced, picture (the slip density increased by a

13

factor of 1.5-2, on average). No slips of the two-frequency mode was detected

for the AOA receivers in the cases under consideration.

The closed description of nonlinear and slow dynamics eﬀects exhibited by the sandstone bars
in numerous resonant response experiments with the longitudinal strain conﬁguration is proposed.
Alongside with the fast subsystem of longitudinal nonlinear displacements we examine the strain
dependent slow subsystem of broken intergrain and interlamina cohesive bonds and show that even
the simplest but phenomenologically correct modelling of their mutual feedback elucidates the main
experimental mysteries typical for the forced longitudinal oscillations of sandstone bars, namely (i)
the hysteretic behaviour of resonance curve on both its slopes, (ii) the linear softening of resonant fre-
quency with the driving level increase, and (iii) the gradual recovery (increase) of resonant frequency
at low dynamical strains after the sample being conditioned by the high ones. In order to reproduce
the highly nonlinear elastic features of sandstone grained structure the realistic nonperturbative
form of strain potential energy has been adopted. The slow dynamics associated with the experi-
mentally observed memory of peak strain history is attributed in our theory to the strain-induced
kinetic changes in concentration of ruptured intergrain and interlamina cohesive bonds causing the
net hysteretic impact on the Young elastic modulus. Finally, we explain how the enhancement of
hysteretic phenomena is to be originated from the respective increase in equilibrium concentration
of ruptured cohesive bonds due to water saturation.

Everybody visiting Prague is bound to be impressed by
its majestic Middle Age architecture almost completely
designed on sandstone rocks. However, apart of their
excellent static characteristic as a building material the
sandstones were shown to demonstrate a number of un-
expected and even surprising dynamical properties [1–5].
Here we bear in mind the numerous experimental results
on nonlinear resonant response exhibited by the rode-like
sandstone samples in the regime of forced longitudinal
oscillations even at considerably small driving levels and
consequently at small dynamic strains [1–5].

To be precise we enumerate the most interesting of
these results. 1) The eﬀective width of resonance curve
depends on the direction of frequency sweep being thin-
ner at upward sweep (i.e. from lower to higher frequen-
from higher to lower
cies) than at downward one (i.e.
frequencies) [1–5]. This eﬀect is proven to be a typical
manifestation of the so-called slow dynamics and can be
treated as the hysteresises both on low frequency and
high frequency slopes of a particular resonance curve. 2)
The peak of resonance curve is shifted into the low fre-
quency region almost linearly with the increase of driving
amplitude [1, 4]. 3) Another evidence of slow dynamics
deals with the gradual recovery (increase) of resonant
frequency to its value ﬁxed by the extremely low driving
level just after the sample has been conditioned by the
very high one [3,5].

All these facts can not be understood in the frame-
work of standard theories of resonant nonlinear response
[6] and imply memory of peak strain history [2]. Some
aspects of the problem had already found their inter-

pretation given by Guyer, McCall and Van Den Abeele
[7] in the framework of McCall-Guyer quasistatic model
[8]. This approach deals essentially with the concept of
auxiliary hysteretic elements allowing one to introduce
an additional nontrivial nonlinear term into the dynam-
ical equation for the ﬁeld of longitudinal displacements.
However, the quoted theoretical treatment may hardly
pretend on the completeness inasmuch as it ignores ini-
tially the dynamics of hysteretic elements postulating the
temporal evolution of amplitude-frequency characteristic
(the key point of claimed results) to be revived poste-
riorly. Although Capogrosso-Sansone and Guyer have
recently developed the dynamical realization of McCall-
Guyer quasistatic model [9], but evaluating its adequacy
to the experimental data turns out to be pretty diﬃcult
task.

In this communication we relinquish the very idea of
auxiliary hysteretic elements as the panacea treating all
peculiarities of any hysteretic phenomena and call atten-
tion on an alternative approach used by Davydov and
Ermakov for the description of bistability in nonlinear
resonant tunneling of electrons through the set of po-
tential barriers [10]. Their move consists in explicit but
physically motivated separation of given physical system
into two nonlinear subsystems, namely the fast and the
slow ones with the mutual coupling between them being
taken into account.

As for the sandstone bars we will identify the fast sub-
system with the ﬁeld of longitudinal displacements while
the slow subsystem with the concentration of defects in
intergrain contact bonds and/or in contact bonds be-

1

tween the laminar sheets. In so doing we should bear in
mind that, due to the law of preferable vapor condensa-
tion into the surfaces with the greater concave curvature
[11], the sandstone porous structure [4, 11] usually keeps
some residual porous water [11] and its impact on the res-
onant properties of rock is to be crucial [12, 13]. Thus,
the thermodynamical estimations when being applied to
the porous rocks show that the intergrain or interlamina
cohesive forces become weaker in the presence of water
[14] what is in agreement with an alternative conception
of swelling pressure [13, 15]. This conclusion is conﬁrmed
by the recent experiments [13] establishing the land-slide
decrease in Young modulus within the twenty percent
interval of water saturation (i.e. until the void surfaces
become completely wet). Certainly we could invoke ad-
ditionally the ordinary capillary forces [13] or hydrolysis
of silicon-oxygen-silicon bond-chains [16] in our consider-
ation, however, either of these mechanisms also leads to
the softening of Young modulus with the saturation in-
crease. Hence, the real question consists not in an exces-
sive (presumably unclaimed) detailization of all plausible
mechanisms, which in the long run may contribute into
the Young modulus upon the qualitatively same footing,
but in their reasonable net formalization by means of
minimal number of slow ﬁelds.

According to Kosevich [17] the equilibrium concentra-
tion of defects preassigned by the stress σ is given by the
formula

cσ = c0 exp (vσ/kT ) ,

(1)

where k and T are the Boltzmann constant and the abso-
lute temperature respectively, while the parameter v > 0
stands for the typical volume accounted for a single de-
fect and characterizes the intensity of dilatation. The
equilibrium concentration of defects in an unstrained bar
c0 has to be some function of both the temperature T
and the water saturation s.
In order to describe the
strain-induced changes in nonequilibrium concentration
of defects c we assume that at any instant of time t the
concentration c must evolve to its would be equilibrium
value cσ (1), where the stress σ is taken at the same in-
stant. Supposing the activation barriers for the defect
creation W to be distributed uniformly over the range
W0 ≤ W ≤ W0 + W+ and the activation barriers for the
defect annihilation U to be distributed uniformly over the
range U0 ≤ U ≤ U0 + U+ we will operate with the den-
sity of defect concentration g and come to the following
kinetic equation

∂g/∂t = − [µθ(g − gσ) + νθ(gσ − g)] (g − gσ).

(2)

Here µ = µ0 exp(−U/kT ) and ν = ν0 exp(−W/kT ) are
the rates of defect annihilation and defect creation re-
spectively, gσ = cσ/U+W+ and θ(z) designates the Heav-
iside step-function. The quantities g and c are related by
the simple deﬁnition

The rate ν0 is determined by the fast oscillations of un-
ruptured bonds, while the rate µ0 by the slow danglings
of ruptured bonds overdamped by the environment. The
immense disparity ν0 ≫ µ0 between ν0 and µ0, com-
prising actually many orders, gives rise to the respective
disparity ν ≫ µ between ν and µ and as a result pro-
vides the physical mechanism that breaks the symmetry
of system response to an alternating external drive and
acts as a sort of the soft ratchet or the leaky diode.

Here x denotes the longitudinal Lagrange coordinate of

the mean density of sandstone and the coeﬃcient of in-
ternal friction in an elastic subsystem. We ignore their
dependencies on temperature and water saturation as-
suming that the main eﬀect is manifested through the
linear decrease of Young modulus E with the concentra-
tion of defects

E = (1 − c/ccr) E+.

Here ccr and E+ are the critical concentration of defects
and the maximal possible value of Young modulus re-
spectively. Both of these parameters we also take as in-
dependent on temperature and water saturation.

respond to the kinematic excitation [19] of bar sample,

where L is the sample length and t > 0. The driving
amplitude D(t) is assumed to be basically constant ex-
cept of the moments when the driving system is switched
on, is switched into another constant driving level or is
switched oﬀ. The time dependency of cyclic driving fre-
quency ω(t) in turn is prescribed by the chosen regime

of frequency sweep. As for the initial conditions they are

Insofar as the experimental data for the Young mod-
ulus in unstrained samples are obtainable from the res-
onant response experiments by the use of low amplitude
protocol (when the driving amplitude D is very small
and the strain-induced creation of defects is negligible)
we can compare them with the values taken from the
expression (7) at c = c0 in order to ﬁt the equilibrium
concentration of defects c0 as the function of T and s

analyzing the temperature dependent data at zero satu-
ration [21] and the saturation dependent data at room

with the following ﬁtting parameters Tcr = 1475◦K,
cosh2 α = 16, β = 10. Here the saturation can vary
within the interval 0 ≤ s ≤ 1. At s 6= 0 this approxi-
mation is expected to work at least for the temperatures
exceeding the freezing-point of porous water.

The computer modelling of nonlinear and slow dynam-
ics eﬀects have been performed in the vicinity of resonant
frequency f0(2), which we understand as the second fre-
quency (l = 2) in the fundamental set

Figure 1 shows the typical resonance curves given as
dependencies of response amplitude R (calculated at
x = L) on the driving frequency f = ω/2π at suc-
cessively higher driving amplitudes D. The continuous
lines correspond to the conditioned resonance curves cal-
culated after two frequency sweeps were performed at
each driving level in order to achieve repeatable hys-
teretic curves. The dotted line demonstrate the uncon-
ditioned curve obtained without any preliminary condi-
tioning. Arrows on highest three curves indicate sweep
directions. For the sake of deﬁniteness the results of com-
puter simulation were adapted to the experimental data
obtained by Ten Cate and Shankland for the Berea sand-
stone [2] and to the experimental conditions therein. In
particular, the ratio E+/ρ was estimated by means of
relationships (13) and (12) with the second fundamen-
tal frequency, the bar length, the temperature and the
saturation being respectively as follows f0(2)=3920Hz,

L = 0.3m, T = 297◦K and s = 0.25. The ratio γ/ρ char-
acterizing the internal friction was chosen from the best
ﬁtting of low amplitude theoretical (Figure 1) and ex-
perimental [2] resonance curves with respect to the qual-
ity factor Q. The parameters µ0 exp(−U0/kT ) = 1s−1
and U+/k = 2525◦K determining the character of slow
relaxation were estimated according to the experimental
measurements of acceleration decay at ﬁxed frequency [2]
and the measurements of recovering resonant frequency
as a function of time [5]. The combination of parameters
vE+/k cosh η = 250◦K was chosen to reproduce quanti-
tatively the hysteretic phenomena at the sweep regimes
typical for the real experimental situation [2]. The pa-
rameter of nonlinearity cosh η = 2500 has been estimated
to map the actual asymmetry of experimental resonance
curves [2]. Another parameters appearing in the stress-
strain relation (5) have been adopted as follows r = 4,
a = 2.

We would like to stress that via the drop of equilibrium
concentration c0 (12) our theory is capable to catch the
drastic suppression of hysteretic splits with the decrease
of water saturation. This conclusion has been conﬁrmed
by the direct computation (not shown). Simultaneously
we have observed the monotonic increase in quality fac-
tor Q with the saturation decrease, i.e. precisely the
tendency well documented by experiments [12].

Figure 2 compares the shifts of resonant frequency as
the functions of driving amplitude at two essentially dif-
ferent values of dilatation parameter v and other param-
eters being kept the same as for the Figure 1. Thus the
curve 1 calculated at vE+/k cosh η = 250◦K, when the
strain-induced feedback between the slow and the fast
subsystems is substantial, demonstrates the almost linear
dependence typical for the materials with the nonclassical
nonlinear response, i.e. the materials possessing all basic
features of slow dynamics. On the contrary the curve 2
calculated at v = 0, when the strain-induced excitation
of slow subsystem is absent and hence the mutual feed-
back between the slow and the fast subsystems is totally
broken, demonstrates the almost quadratic dependence
typical for the materials with the classical nonlinear re-
sponse.

Finally, Figure 3 shows the gradual recovery of reso-
nant frequency fr to its maximal limiting value f0 after
the bar has been subjected to high amplitude condition-
ing. In the course of computer simulation we have plot-
ted three diﬀerent curves corresponding to three diﬀerent
saturations with all other model parameters adopted ear-
lier for the Figure 1 being preserved. Although the total
shift of resonant frequency fr − f0 consists of two phys-
ically diﬀerent parts, namely (i) the traditional dynamic
shift caused by the strain nonlinearity at high levels of
excitation and (ii) the shift caused by the impact of slow
subsystem, however only the second part might actually
be registered during the recovery process, insofar as the
ﬁrst one vanishes almost instantaneously when the con-
ditioning got switched oﬀ. Hence, the whole character
of recovery should inevitably be governed by the slow

interlamina cohesive bonds. From Figure 3 we clearly
see that the suggested kinetic equation for the density
of defect concentration (2) supplemented by the simple
deﬁnition of total concentration (3) and the reasonable
relationship between the Young modulus and the concen-
tration of defects (7) yields the very wide time interval
10 ≤ (t− tc)/t0 ≤ 1000 of logarithmic recovery of the res-
onant frequency in a complete agreement with the exper-
imental results [5]. Here tc is the moment of conditioning

Networks are paradigms for describing complex biological, social and technological sys-
tems. Here I argue that networks provide a coherent framework to construct coarse-
grained models for many diﬀerent physical systems. To elucidate these ideas, I discuss
two long-standing problems. The ﬁrst concerns the structure and dynamics of magnetic
ﬁelds in the solar corona, as exempliﬁed by sunspots that startled Galileo almost 400
years ago. We discovered that the magnetic structure of the corona embodies a scale free
network, with spots at all scales. A network model representing the three-dimensional
geometry of magnetic ﬁelds, where links rewire and nodes merge when they collide in
space, gives quantitative agreement with available data, and suggests new measure-
ments. Seismicity is addressed in terms of relations between events without imposing
space-time windows. A metric estimates the correlation between any two earthquakes.
Linking strongly correlated pairs, and ignoring pairs with weak correlation organizes the
spatio-temporal process into a sparse, directed, weighted network. New scaling laws for
seismicity are found. For instance, the aftershock decay rate decreases as ∼ 1/t in time
up to a correlation time, tomori. An estimate from the data gives tomori to be about one
year for small magnitude 3 earthquakes, about 1400 years for the Landers event, and
roughly 26,000 years for the earthquake causing the 2004 Asian tsunami. Our results
conﬁrm Kagan’s conjecture that aftershocks can rumble on for centuries.

1. Introduction

A fundamental problem in physics, which is not always recognized as being “a funda-
mental physics problem”, is how to mathematically describe emergent phenomena.
It seems hopeless for many reasons to make a theory of emergence that harmonizes
all scales, from the Planck scale to the size of our Universe, and includes life on
Earth with its manifest details, such as bacteria, society, or ourselves as individual
personalities. That would be a true theory of everything (TToE). (For a discussion
see Refs. [1,2].)

However, a reasonable aim is to describe how entities or excitations with their
own eﬀective dynamics develop from symmetries, conservation laws and nonlinear
interactions between elements at a lower level. Some famous examples in statis-
tical physics are critical point ﬂuctuations, avalanches in sandpiles,3 vorticity in
turbulence,4 or the distribution of luminous matter in the Universe.5,6,7 Contem-

porary work in quantum gravity suggests that both general relativity and quantum
mechanics may emerge from coarse graining a low energy approximation to the
fundamental causal histories. These histories are sequences of changes in graphs,
that may be nonlocal or small-world networks.8 Similar sets of questions crop up
across the board. How do you get qualitatively new structures and dynamics from
underlying laws?

An important distinction appears between equilibrium and far from equilibrium
systems. Roughly speaking, most equilibrium systems are complex in the same
way. They exhibit emergent behavior at critical points with ﬂuctuations governed
by symmetry principles, etc. Non-equilibrium systems, however, seem complex in
a myriad, diﬀerent ways.

However, a variety of indicators point to principles of organization for emergent
phenomena far from equilibrium. Various types of scaling behaviors in physical sys-
tems (scale invariance,9 scale covariance,10,11 etc.) can be quantitatively predicted
using coarse-grained models. After all, the underlying equations typically govern at
length and time scales well below those where observations are made. The key is to
capture the dynamics of larger scale entities, or ”coherent structures”,12 and use
those as building blocks to model the whole system. Ideally, renormalized models
may be derived from the underlying equations, but it is not clear that this is always
possible. Even without an explicit derivation, though, once such a model is born
out in a speciﬁc system, by subjecting it to falsiﬁable tests, it may also connect to
other physical situations with similar, or even diﬀerent underlying laws.

Nowadays, computational science tends to emphasize studies of bigger and bigger
systems with more and more details. That is unlikely, by itself, to lead to any better
understanding of emergence, and also can easily be demonstrated to be fruitless for
many interesting problems in physics, like those discussed here. There are simply too
many degrees of freedom coupled over too long times, compared to the microscopic
time. That doesn’t mean that these problems are unsolvable through computational
methods though. We must use a diﬀerent starting point.

Complex networks have been intensively investigated recently as descriptions
of biological, social and technological phenomena.13,14 In fact, a sparse network
expresses coarse-graining in a natural way, since the few links present highlight
relevant interactions between eﬀective degrees of freedom, with all other nodes and
links deleted. Then renormalization may proceed further on the network alone
by grouping tightly coupled nodes or modules together and ﬁnding the interactions
between those new eﬀective degrees of freedom. Understanding processes of network
organization, perhaps through an information theory of complex networks,15 is
(arguably) necessary to make progress toward theories of emergence in physical
systems.

In order to demonstrate the wide applicability of these ideas in diverse contexts
and at diﬀerent levels in our ability to describe physical phenomena, I present
two distinctive examples of networks as empirical descriptions for physical systems.

First, I discuss the coronal magnetic ﬁeld and show that much of the important
physics can be captured with a network where nodes and links interact in space and
time with local rules. In this case, the network is an abstraction of the geometry of
the magnetic ﬁelds. We use insights gained from studying the underlying equations,
and a host of observations from the Sun to determine a minimal model.16,17,18

Second, I discuss a new approach to seismicity based solely on relations between
events, and not on any ﬁxed space, time or magnitude scales. Earthquakes are
represented as nodes in the network, and strongly correlated pairs are linked. A
sparse, directed network of disconnected, highly clustered graphs emerges. The
ensemble of variables and their relations on this network reveal new scaling laws for
seismicity.

Our network model of coronal magnetic ﬁelds is minimal in that if any of its ﬁve
basic ingredients are deleted then its behavior changes and fails to agree with obser-
vations. However, its rules can be changed in many ways, for instance by altering
parameters, or adding interactions without modifying most statistical properties.
Although the model is not explicitly constructed according to a formalism based on
symmetry principles, relevant operators, and general arguments used for statistical
ﬁeld theories, it appears to have comparable robustness and ﬁxed point properties.
Lastly, the model is falsiﬁable. We have made numerous predictions for observables,
as well as suggesting new quantities to be measured. In fact, studying its behavior
led us to re-analyze previously published coronal magnetic ﬁeld data, and reveal
the scale-free nature of magnetic “concentrations” on the visible surface of the Sun.

2. The Coronal Magnetic Field
The Sun is a magnetic star.19 Like Earth, matter density at its surface drops
abruptly, and a tenuous outer atmosphere, the corona, looms above. The surface,
or photosphere, is much cooler than both the interior of the Sun, and the corona. For
this reason, only magnetic ﬁelds at or near the surface have been directly measured.
Several mechanisms have been proposed for coronal heating including nanoﬂares.20
Like bigger, ordinary ﬂares, these may be caused by sudden releases of magnetic
energy from reconnection. Reconnection occurs when magnetic ﬁeld lines rapidly
rearrange themselves. Fast reconnection is a threshold process that occurs when
magnetic ﬁeld gradients become suﬃciently steep.20,21,22

In the convective zone below the photosphere, temperature gradients drive insta-
bilities. Moving charges in the plasma create magnetic ﬁelds. Rising up, these ﬁelds
pierce the photosphere and loop out into the corona. The pattern of ﬂux on the
photosphere and in the corona is not uniform, though. Flux is tightly bundled into
long-lived ﬂux tubes that attach to the photosphere at footpoints. These ﬂux loops
survive for hours or more, while the lifetimes of the granules on the photosphere is
minutes.

Footpoints aggregate into magnetic “concentrations” on the photosphere. Mea-
suring these concentrations provides a quantitative picture that can be compared

data originally shown in Figure 5 of Ref. [24]. The model data shown represents the probability
distribution, P (kf oot), for number of loops, kf oot, connected to a footpoint. This has been rescaled
so that one loop, kf oot = 1, equals the minimum threshold of ﬂux, 1.55 × 1017 Mx. The cutoﬀ at

by changing the size of the system.

with theory. The strongest, and physically largest concentrations are sunspots,
which may contain more than 1022 Mx.23 The intense magnetic ﬁelds in these re-
gions cool the plasma, so they appear dark in the visible spectrum. The smallest
resolvable concentrations above the current resolution scale of ≈ 1016 Mx are “frag-
ments”. Solar physicists have constructed elaborate theories where at each scale a
unique physical process is responsible for the dynamics and generation of magnetic
concentrations, e.g. a “large scale dynamo” versus a “surface dynamo” etc. These
theories predict an exponential distribution for concentration sizes.

2.1. Coronal Fields Form a Scale Free Network
David Hughes and I re-analyzed17,18 previously published data sets reporting the
distribution of concentration sizes.24 As shown in Fig. 1, we discovered that the
distribution is scale free over the entire range of measurement. The probability to
have a concentration with ﬂux Φ, P (Φ) ∼ Φ−γ with γ ≈ 1.7, as indicated by the

ﬂat behavior of F (φ) in Fig. 1. Similar results were found using other data sets.17

2.2. The Model

Results from numerical simulations of our network model are also shown in Fig. 1.
The only calibration used (which is unavoidable) was to set the minimal unit of ﬂux
in the model equal to the ﬂux threshold of the measurement. How did we get such
good agreement without solving any of the plasma physics equations?

Considering the long-lived ﬂux tubes as the important coherent structures, we
treated the coronal magnetic ﬁeld as made up of discrete interacting loops embedded
in three dimensional space.16 Each directed loop traces the mid-line of a ﬂux tube,
and is anchored to a ﬂat surface at two opposite polarity footpoints. A footpoint
locates the center of a magnetic concentration, and is considered to be a point. A
collection of these loops and their footpoints gives a distilled representation of the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld structure. Our network model is able to describe the three
dimensional geometry of ﬁelds that are very complicated or interwoven.

The essential ingredients, which must be included to agree with observations
are: injection of small loops, submergence of very small loops, footpoint diﬀusion,
aggregation of footpoints, and reconnection of loops. Observations indicate that
all of these physical processes occur in the corona.20,21,24 Loops injected at small
length scales are stretched and shrunk as their footpoints diﬀuse over the surface.
Nearby footpoints of the same polarity aggregate, to form magnetic fragments,
which can themselves aggregate to form ever larger concentrations of ﬂux. Each
loop carries a single unit of ﬂux, and the magnetic ﬁeld strength at a footpoint is
given by the number of loops attached to it. The number of loops that share a given
pair of footpoints measures the strength of the link. The link strengths also have a
scale-free distribution with a steeper power law than the degree distribution of the
nodes, or concentrations. Also, the number of nodes that a given node is connected
to by at least one loop is scale-free. Both of these additional claims could also be
tested against observations.17,18

Loops can reconnect when they collide, or cross at a point in three dimensional
space above the surface. The ﬂux emerging from the positive footpoint of one of the
reconnecting loops is then no longer constrained to end up at the other footpoint
of the same loop, but may instead go to the negative footpoint of the other loop.
This occurs if the rewiring lowers the combined loop length. The loops between
the newly paired footpoints then both relax to a semi-circular shape. Reconnection
allows footpoints to exchange partners and reshapes the network, but it maintains
the degree of each footpoint.

If rewiring occurs, one or both loops may need to cross another loop. A sin-
gle reconnection between a pair of loops can trigger an avalanche of reconnection.
Reconnections occur instantaneously compared to the diﬀusion of footpoints and
injection of loops. It may also happen that due to reconnection or footpoint dif-
fusion, very small loops are created. These are removed from the system. Thus

has been scaled such that one unit of length is equal to 0.5Mm.

the collection of loops is an open system, driven by loop injection with an outﬂow
of very small loops. From any initial condition, the system reaches a steady state
where the loops self organize into a scale free network. As shown in Fig. 1 , the
number of loops, kf oot, connected to any footpoint is distributed as a power law

P (kf oot) ∼ k

f oot with γ = 1.75 ± −0.1 .

2.2.1. Further predictions of the network model

The distribution of distances, d, between footpoint pairs attached to the same loop
can also be calculated and compared with measurement data as shown in Fig. 2.
Indeed, by setting one unit of length in the model equal to 0.5 × 103km on the
photosphere, good agreement between the model results and observation is obtained
up to the supergranule cell size. Deviations above that length scale may be due to
several causes: our assumption that the loops are perfectly semi-circular, ﬁnite
system size eﬀects in the model or observations, or the force free approximation
used to calculate the ﬂux tube connectivity from observations of concentrations.
Comparing with the observed diﬀusive behavior of magnetic concentrations25 allows
an additional calibration of time. One unit of time in the model is equal to about

July 30, 2013

erice5

7

300 seconds on the photosphere. From these three calibrations we are able to
determine values for the total solar ﬂux and the “ﬂux turnover time”, which both
agree quantitatively with observations. See Ref. [16] for details.

Our model predicts not only nominally universal quantities like various criti-
cal exponents characterizing the ﬂux network but also quantities that have typical
scales, such as total solar ﬂux, the distribution of footpoint separations, and the
ﬂux turnover time in the corona. In order to represent the geometry of the coronal
magnetic ﬁelds, a three-dimensional model, as discussed here, is required. Whether
similar network models can be used to describe other high Reynolds number astro-
physical plasmas remains an open question.

3. Seismicity

Despite many eﬀorts, seismicity remains an obscure phenomenon shrouded in vague
ideas without benchmarks of testability. At present, no dynamical model can cap-
ture, simultaneously, the three most robust statistical features of seismicity: (1) the
Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law26,27 for the distribution of earthquake magnitudes,
and the clustering of activity in (2) space and (3) time. Spatio-temporal correla-
tions include the Omori law28,29 for the decay in the rate of aftershocks (see Eq. 4)
and the fractal appearance of earthquake epicenters. Note that stochastic processes
like the ETAS process30 require three or more power law distributions to be put in
by hand. Since these are the main scaling features (1-3) that we wish to establish a
plausible dynamical mechanism for, ETAS models are not regarded by this author
as dynamical models of seismicity. To begin with, better methods to characterize
seismicity are needed. Here I brieﬂy discuss a network paradigm put forward by
Marco Baiesi and myself to this end.31,32

3.1. A Uniﬁed Approach to Diﬀerent Patterns of Seismic Activity

Since seismic rates increase sharply after a large earthquake in the region, events
have been classiﬁed as aftershocks or main shocks, and the statistics of after-
shock sequences have been extensively studied. Usually, aftershocks are collected
by counting all events within a predeﬁned space-time window following a main
event,33,34,35 These sequences are used e.g. to describe earthquake triggering36 or
predict earthquakes.37 Obviously, some types of activity, such as swarms, remote
triggering,38 etc. cannot ﬁt into this framework. Perhaps a diﬀerent description is
needed for each pattern of seismic activity. On the other hand, it seems worthwhile
to look for a uniﬁed perspective to study various patterns of seismic activity within
a coherent framework.39,40

What if we do not ﬁx a priori the number of main shocks an event can be an
aftershock of? Perhaps an event can be an aftershock of more than one predecessor.
On the other hand, all events are not equally correlated to each other. Probably
the situation is somewhere in between having one (or zero) correlated predecessors

July 30, 2013

erice5

8

or being strongly correlated to everything that happened before. In fact, a sparse
but indeﬁnite property of correlations between events may be ubiquitous to all
intermittent spatio-temporal processes with memory.

A sparse network (where each node is an event or earthquake) linking strongly
correlated pairs of events stands out as a good starting point for describing seismicity
in a uniﬁed way. In order to pursue this line of reasoning, we treat all events on the
same footing, irrespective of their magnitude, local tectonic features, etc.40,41,42,43
However, unlike other approaches we do not pre-deﬁne any set of space or time
windows. The sequence of activity itself selects these. Our method is also unrelated
to that of Abe and Suzuki.44

3.2. Relations Between Pairs of Events: The Metric

We consider ONLY the relations between earthquakes and NOT the properties of
individual events. Only catalogs that are considered complete are examined,43 and
no preferred scales are imposed on the phenomenon. Instead, we invoke a metric
to estimate the correlation between any two earthquakes, irrespective of how far
apart they are in space and/or time.31,32 Consider as a null hypothesis45 that
earthquakes are uncorrelated in time. Pairs of events where the null hypothesis is
strongly violated are correlated. The metric measures the extent to which the null
hypothesis is wrong.

The speciﬁc null hypothesis that we have investigated so far31,32 is that earth-
quakes occur with a distribution of magnitudes given by the GR law, with epicenters
located on a fractal of dimension df , randomly in time. Setting df = 2 does not
change the observed scaling behaviors, nor does varying the GR parameter, b.

An earthquake j in the seismic region occurs at time Tj at location Rj. Look
backward in time to the appearance of earthquake i of magnitude mi at time Ti,
at location Ri. How likely is event i, given that event j occurred where and when
it did? According to the null hypothesis, the number of earthquakes of magnitude
within an interval ∆m of mi that would be expected to have occurred within the
time interval t = Tj − Ti seconds, and within a distance l = |Ri − Rj| meters, is

nij ≡ (const) t ldf 10

−bmi ∆m .

(1)

Note that the space-time domain (t, l) appearing in Eq. 1 is self-selected by the
particular history of seismic activity in the region and not set by any observer. All
earthquake pairs are considered on the same basis according to this metric.

Consider a pair of earthquakes (i, j) where nij ≪ 1; so that the expected number
of earthquakes according to the null hypothesis is very small. However, event i
actually occurred relative to j, which, according to the metric, is surprising. A
small value nij ≪ 1 indicates that the correlation between j and i is very strong,
and vice versa. By this argument, the correlation cij between any two earthquakes

July 30, 2013

2:26 Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in

erice5

9

(2)

i and j can be estimated to be inversely proportional to nij, or

cij = 1/nij

.

We measured cij between all pairs of earthquakes greater than magnitude 3 in
the catalog for Southern California from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 2003.46
The removal of small events assures that the catalog is complete, but otherwise the
cutoﬀ magnitude is not important. The distribution of the correlation variables cij
for all pairs i, j was observed to be a power law over fourteen orders of magnitude.
Since no characteristic values of c appear in this distribution, it doesn’t make sense
to talk about distinctly diﬀerent classes of relationships between pairs. On the
other hand, due to the extremely broad distribution, each earthquake j may have
exceptional events in its past with much stronger correlation to it than all the others
combined. These strongly correlated pairs of events can be marked as linked nodes,
and the collection of linked nodes forms a sparse network of disconnected, highly
clustered graphs.

3.3. Directed, Weighted Networks of Correlated Earthquakes

A sparse, directed, weighted network is constructed by only linking pairs whose
correlation c exceeds a given threshold, c<. Each link is directed from the past to
the future. For each threshold, c<, the error made in deleting links with c < c<
can be estimated. For instance, throwing out 99.8% of links gives results accurate
to within 1%. This leads to not only massive data reduction with controllable
error, but also a renormalized model of seismicity, which extracts the important,
correlated degrees of freedom.

Each link contains several variables such as the time between the linked events,
the spatial distance between their epicenters, the magnitudes of the earthquakes,
and the correlation between the linked pairs. The networks are highly clustered
with a universal clustering coeﬃcient ≈ 0.8 for nodes with small degrees, as well
broad, approximately power law in- and out-degree distributions for the nodes.

Consequently, some events have many aftershocks, or outgoing links, while oth-
ers have one, or zero. Also, some events are aftershocks of many previous events,
i.e. they have many incoming links, while others are aftershocks of only one (or
zero) events. The data reveal an absence of characteristic values for the number
of in or out-going links to an earthquake.32 For each event j that has at least one
incoming link, we deﬁne a link weight to each ”parent” earthquake i it is attached
to as

where the sum is over all earthquakes k with links going into j. For instance, an

without changing the scaling properties of the ensemble of network variables.

law, Eq. 4. As guides to the eye, dashed lines represent a decay ∼ 1/t. The dense curves represent
the ﬁts obtained by means of Eq. 5 for m = 3, m = 4, and m = 5.

3.4. The Omori Law for Earthquakes of All Magnitudes

Fig. 3 shows the rate of aftershocks for the Landers, Hector Mine, and Northridge
events. The weights, w, of the links made at time t after one of these events are
binned into geometrically increasing time intervals. The total weight in each bin
is then divided by the temporal width of the bin to obtain a rate of weighted
aftershocks per second. The same procedure is applied to each remaining event,
not aftershocks of these three. An average is made for the rate of aftershocks linked
to events having a magnitude within an interval ∆m of m. Fig. 3 also shows the
averaged results for m = 3 (1871 events), m = 4 (175 events), m = 5 (28 events)
and m = 5.9 (4 events).

Earthquakes of all magnitudes have aftershocks that decay according to an

was ﬁtted to the data, excluding short times, where the the aftershock rates do not
yet scale as 1/t. The short time deviation from power law behavior is presumably
due to saturation of the detection system, which is unable to reliably detect events
happening at a fast rate. However, this problem does not occur at later times,
where the rates are lower. Some examples of these ﬁts are also shown in Fig. 3 for
the intermediate magnitude events. From these ﬁts, a scaling law

tomori(m) ≃ 105.25+0.74m sec

was observed for times shorter than the duration of the catalog. It corresponds to
tomori ≈ 11 months for m = 3, and to tomori ≈ 5 years for m = 4. An extrapolation
yields tomori ≈ 1400 years for an event with m = 7.3 such as the Landers event
and tomori ≈ 26, 000 years for the 9.0 Northern Sumatra earthquake causing the
2004 Asian tsunami. These results conﬁrm Kagan’s conjecture that aftershocks can
rumble on for centuries.47 Indeed, with previous measurement techniques it was
not possible to test his hypothesis.

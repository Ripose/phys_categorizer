Vulcanian explosive eruption, which is a nonlinear and nonequilibrium abrupt dynamics of
magma-gas mixture, is modeled by a two-component Lennard-Jones particle system. Molecular-
dynamics simulation of a shock-tube experiment gives consistent results with a explosive erup-
tion picture of volcanology; Shock wave and expansion wave are reproduced. In addition bubble
nucleation of a gas component in the magma melt and spinodal-like decomposition are observed
in the simulation. The result is also compared with a continuum hydrodynamic model; Quali-
tative features of continuum dynamics are reproduced by the present model. We ﬁnd that the
particle description of dynamics is an eﬀective method in such kind of abrupt dynamics.

KEYWORDS: Vulcanian eruption, Lennard-Jones particle, molecular dynamics simulation, shock tube

Volcanic eruption is complicated physical phenomena
and the physical understanding has not been well estab-
lished yet; The problem is to understand nonlinear and
nonequilibrium dynamics of magma-gas mixture accom-
panied by phase transitions.1–3 Existence of gas, which is
mainly H2O, is sometimes forgotten, but it is pointed out
that such gas component plays an important role in ex-
plosive eruption.4 Type of volcanic eruption is classiﬁed
into three classes by chronological behavior; One is so-
called Vulcanian type eruption, which is widely observed
in Japanese volcanos. This type is characterized by an
intermittent explosive eruption and formation of a lava
dome. These features are determined by physical prop-
erties of magma; Speciﬁcally viscosity of magma controls
them.

In this paper, we study Vulcanian eruption, because its
explosive mechanism will be the most interesting phys-
ically, in particular, in the context of nonequilibrium
physics; In the volcanology, an eruption picture is consid-
ered as follows: A stage of eruption dynamics consists of a
magma chamber and a conduit. Top of conduit is covered
by a lava dome. In a top of magma chamber or a lower
part of conduit, a gas component is almost completely
dissolved into the magma melt. In the upper region of
saturated magma, the gas is exsolved according to the
equilibrium solubility law. As decreasing the lithostatic
pressure, volume fraction of gases is increasing. At the
beginning of eruption, pressure of the magma-gas mix-
ture is considered to increase, although the mechanism
is not clear yet. When the lava dome cannot support
this overpressure, it disrupts the lava dome. At the next
moment, two shock waves appear and propagate; One
is a shock wave formed between atmosphere and com-
pressed air and it propagates upward. Another is decom-
pression wave in magma-gas melt and it goes to opposite
direction. During the eruption it is observed that the
transition from the laminar ﬂow of bubbly melt to the
turbulent ﬂow of gas-magma dispersion in the conduit.
This transition layer determines the front of fragmenta-

tion wave which propagates downward. At the moment,
viscosity of magma-gas mixture is drastically changed
abruptly about the order of 1012 ∼ 1015Pa · s.

There have been many theoretical investigations of
Vulcanian eruption in the volcanism study. In 1995,
Woods proposed the model for magma ﬂow in conduit;5
In his model magma-gas mixture is treated as a one-
dimensional nonviscotic compressible ﬂuid with single
component. This model can capture physical properties
of dynamics in some sense. But treatment of dynamics
is not well satisﬁed; For example, ﬂow is treated as isen-
tropic one, though bubble nucleation accompanies the
eruption. There are some other phenomenological mod-
els, but the present understanding of the eruption dy-
namics is still unsatisfactory in the context of nonequi-
librium physics.2, 3

Recent progress of experimental techniques enables us
to compare such theoretical model with experimental re-
sults; These experiments are called as shock-tube ex-
periment.6–9 In the experiment, analogue materials of
magma-gas mixture, such as viscoelastic materials and
powder, are used. It is observed that the behavior of ex-
plosion depends on the viscosity of analogue materials.
Thus a non-viscotic treatment in a theoretical study is
not suﬃcient.

In this paper, we try to establish a computational mi-
croscopic model of Vulcanian eruption; So to say, we want
to make “an Ising model of Vulcanian eruption”. Here
we describe dynamics of the mixture by microscopic par-
ticle dynamics. A particle dynamics simulation can be
regarded as an ideal shock-tube experiment, because we
can calculate macroscopic quantities. In addition, using
the particle dynamics, we can also reproduce hydrody-
namic behavior described by a continuum description of
Navier-Stokes equation. Even in Newtonian dynamics,
we can produce macroscopic behavior in linear nonequi-
librium thermodynamic regime.10–13 Moreover we can
also discuss phenomena in far from equilibrium state,
which are not captured by continuum descriptions based
on local equilibrium. Thus the particle model enable us
to explore nonequilibrium dynamics of volcano, as well as

the model can verify an macroscopic theoretical model.
Here we assume microscopic dynamics are governed by

the following Hamiltonian:

where φ(r) is Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential: φ(r) =
4ǫ{(σ/r)12 − (σ/r)6} + φ0. For computational eﬃciency,
we introduce a potential cutoﬀ as 3.9σ and determine
the value of φ0 to be φ(3.9σ) = 0. And N denotes to-
tal particle number, mi denotes mass of particle i, pi
and qi denote particle three-dimensional momenta and
coordinates, respectively. Dimensionless parameters αi
and mgas/mmagma are selected so that it will reproduce
similar properties as magma gas;4 We take αi to be 1
for magma particles, and 0.1 for gas particles. It deter-
mines energy scales of magma and gas. Ratio of melting
temperatures of magma to gas is given by α2
gas
and it is 100 in the present model, although it is ap-
proximately 1000 for actual magma and gas. Present
choice is ten times less than actual situation, but it is
suﬃcient to describe the explosive eruption as we will
show in the following. Particle mass ratio is chosen as
mgas/mmagma = 0.1, which is of order actual mass ra-
tio. Hereafter we measure length, mass, and energy by
the units of σ, mmagma and ǫ, respectively, and use di-
mensionless variables. Employing the Lennard-Jones 12-
6 potential makes us to describe thermodynamic phases
of gas, ﬂuid, solid, and their coexisting state.

magma/α2

Using the above Hamiltonian, we calculate particle
motion. The geometry of the system is as follows (see also
Fig. 1): Consider rectangular parallelepiped with a size
Lx × Ly × Lz. For x and y directions, periodic boundary
conditions are imposed. A eruption direction is to z axis,
and we prepare elastic walls at bottom and top. These
walls are represented by repulsion part of Lennard-Jones
potential.

First we have to prepare initial state as thermal equi-
librium one. In this stage, whole system is divided into
two parts, “chamber” (0 ≤ z ≤ Ld) and “conduit”
(Ld ≤ z ≤ Lz) by a diaphragm, which is located at
z = Ld, made of same elastic walls at z = 0 and z = Lz.
At the beginning, magma and gas particles are contained
in the chamber. Contrarily, only gas particles are in the

conduit. For preparing initial state, we do an isothermal
simulation with No´se-Hoover thermostat in each part of
the system.14–16 Density and temperature in the cham-
ber are chosen as gas particles are uniformly mixed into
magma particles; There is no phase separation.

After thermalization, we remove the separator between
conduit and chamber and we detach the thermostat.
Then the system obeys the Hamiltonian dynamics. If
pressure in the chamber is higher than one in the conduit,
an explosion is activated.

Simulation details are as follows: The second order
symplectic method (the leapfrog method) is used in nu-
merical integration. Time integration slice is taken to
be 10−3. This value is suﬃcient for present simulations,
which is checked by energy conservation.

In the simulation, we calculate several physical quan-
tities in boxes which are obtained by slicing along z-
direction with a unit length σ.17, 18 Number density n(z)
and mass density ρ(z) of the slice z are basic quantities
of macroscopic dynamics deﬁned by counting a number
and mass in the local slice. Barycentric velocity v(z) is
deﬁned through sum of momenta in the slice. Pressure
p(z), is deﬁned by a trace of stress tensor. And temper-
ature T (z) is deﬁned by variance of particle velocities
from local barycentric motion.

Here we present a typical result of simulation as space-
time proﬁle of physical quantities. In Figs. 2, number
density n(z) and pressure p(z) are presented. In this
simulation, we take following parameters: System size is
Lx = Ly = 40, Lz = 740. In an initial thermal equilibra-
tion stage, a diaphragm is located at z = 40, so the size
of magma chamber is 40 × 40 × 40 and one of the con-
duit is 40 × 40 × 700. Total number of particle is 176 000,
which consists of 57 600 magma particles and 118 400 gas
particles. The chamber contains 57 600 magma particles
and 6 400 gas particles. Other 112 000 gas particles are

one magma droplet is observed.

In this way, magma-gas mixture become inhomoge-
neous mixture and internal structure of bubbles are grow-
ing. Such behavior is consistent with the scenario of vol-
canology. But in the present simulation, transition to
magma dispersion ﬂow is not observed. The reason may
be that smaller cross section of conduit and ﬁniteness
particles.

Next we compare the present simulation results
with the continuum description given by Woods.5 In
his model, magma-gas mixture is described by one-
dimensional nonviscotic compressible one-component
ﬂuid. The dynamics are described by a continuity equa-
tion, an equation of motion, and the followings:

where ρ, ρl, pg, T, R, n, φ and γm denote mass density,
mass density of magma component, pressure of gas com-
ponent, temperature, a gas constant, a mass fraction
of magma and gas components, a volume fraction of
magma and gas components, and ratio of speciﬁc heats,
respectively. In these quantities, ρ, pg, T and φ−1 ≡

ρlRT are variables. Other ρl, R, n, and γm are
n
ﬁxed to some constant values. The ﬁrst equation is an
equation of states, and the second one expresses an isen-
tropic condition derived from the ﬁrst law of thermo-
dynamics. As we know the present equation of states is
almost identical to one of ideal gas.

These equations are essentially same as ones of com-
pressible ideal gas ﬂuid. To study the equations is just
an textbook example.19, 20 We get a standard rewrite as

where w and a(ρ) are a velocity ﬁeld and a sound veloc-
ity, respectively. The sound velocity of magma-gas mix-
ture is a function of ρ, and it is expressed as a2(ρ) =
0(ρ/ρ0)γm−1(φ0/φ)γm+1 (a0, ρ0, φ0 are sound velocity,
a2
density, and volume fraction at some reference state.)
This equation gives characteristic curves and conserved
quantities on them. Then we can solve the equation in
characteristic regions. For obtaining global shock tube
solution, we have to glue the solution with appropriate
boundary conditions.

In Fig. 4, temperature T (z), barycentric velocity
v(z)z, pressure p(z), mass density ρ(z) of the present
simulation are shown. Simulation parameters are taken
to be as follows: System size is Lx = Ly = 32, Lz = 408
and size of magma chamber is 32 × 32 × 200. Initial num-
ber density of magma chamber is taken to be 1 and con-
duit density is 0.02, thus the number of particles in the
chamber is 204 800, which contains 10% gas particles.
The number of gas particles in the conduit is 4 096. In
this simulation, we imposed an artiﬁcial boundary condi-
tion at the top of conduit; For decreasing reﬂection eﬀects
from the top elastic wall, we attach a particle sink at the
top, in which particles with the energy larger than some
threshold value are removed from the system.

We can observe characteristic regions in Fig. 4. Let us
compare these results with continuum descriptions. The

in the conduit. Then initial number densities are 1 for
the chamber and 0.1 for the conduit. Thermalization is
done with the chamber temperature 2 and the conduit
temperature 0.8.

In Figs. 2, a horizontal axis corresponds to z direction
and explosion goes to right. A vertical axis represents
time. At the time 0, the diaphragm is removed. In the
proﬁle of number density, we recognize two characteris-
tic density waves. First one begins at (z = 40, t = 0)
and propagates to (750, 120). This wave corresponds to
a shock wave between hot gas, which is heated by adia-
batic compressing, and thermal equilibrium gas. Its ve-
locity is larger than a sound velocity of equilibrium con-
duit gas. This wave is reﬂected at (757, 120), because
an elastic wall exists at there. Another wave propa-
gates more slowly than the shock wave from (40, 0) to
(300, 185). Front position of this density wave corre-
sponds to magma-gas contact surface.

There are other small waves in this ﬁgure. A wave
propagating from (0, 10) to (170, 185) is also reﬂecting
wave caused by the elastic wall located at z = 0. A wave
propagating to opposite direction, which is from (40, 0)
to (0, 10), is also observed in the ﬁgure. This wave is an
expansion wave of dense magma-gas mixture.

Other signiﬁcant features are observed in this space-
time proﬁle. After propagating magma-gas contact wave,
some internal structures are glowing. To investigate the
internal structure in details, we show snapshot of sim-
ulation are shown in Figs. 3. These snapshot are taken
from the simulation drawing Fig. 2, so simulation pa-
rameters are identical ones of that simulation. We only
draw magma particles and gas particles which are in the
magma chamber at the initial condition. Gas particles
coming from the conduit are omitted. Explosion propa-
gates to the right direction in this ﬁgure, which is z axis.
Before removing the diaphragm, magma and gas are
uniformly mixed in the magma chamber. But, in Figs. 3,
inhomogeneous mixing of those components is gradually
growing during the eruption. This reminds us of spinodal
decomposition. Size of exsolved gas bubble grows from
Figs. 3(a) to (b); In Fig. 3(a), bubble size are widely
distributed but, in (b), one large gas bubble and small
bubbles in the thick magma exists. In large gas bubble,

Fig. 4. Spatial proﬁles of temperature, velocity (z), pressure, and
mass density at t = 15: System size is taken to be Lx = 32, Ly =
32, Lz = 408 and size of magma chamber is 32 × 32 × 200. Ini-
tial mass density and temperature are taken to be 1 and 2, re-
spectively. We can recognize characteristic regions. From right,
“initial equilibrium state”, “hot gas region”, “cold gas region”,
“expanding wave region”, and “initial equilibrium state” again
are observed. These regions are indicated by gray rectangular.

solution of Eq. (3) teaches us that there are three regions
in shock tube analysis, that is, a hot gas region, a cold
gas region, and an expanding wave region. Corresponding
regions of simulation are indicated in the ﬁgure; In the
“hot gas” region, gases are heating up by the shock wave.
In contrast, in the “cold gas” region, gases are cooling by
an adiabatic expansion. Another region is an “expand-
ing wave” region in which the expanding wave exists and
physical quantities are smoothly changed. Physical prop-
erties of such regions obtained by the simulation are al-
most equivalent to ones of shock tube analysis. But there
is a little mismatch with the solution; Analysis of com-
pressible ﬂuid gives constant proﬁles of physical quanti-
ties in both hot and cold gas regions. But, in this simu-
lation, some structures are observed in each regions. For
example, in a velocity proﬁle of the hot gas region, veloc-
ity near cold gas is rather faster than other areas. This
high velocity area is caused by pushing eﬀects of magma-
gas contact surface, which is corresponding to the front
of cold gas contact. These high velocity particles are not
thermalized yet; In the molecular dynamics simulation,
microscopic relaxation is apparently observed.

To summarize, we have constructed a microscopic
model of Vulcanian eruption by a two-components
Lennard-Jones particle system. We observed that the
particle dynamics is eﬃcient in this kind of dynamics.
Using the present model we can reproduce characteris-

tic features of explosive eruption such as a shock wave,
a expansion wave. At the early stage of the eruption,
we also compare the simulation result with the analytic
model given by Woods. Qualitative behavior is almost
consistent with the analytic result, even though the ﬂow
is treated as nonviscotic one in the analytic model. In ad-
dition, we have also observed that the internal structure
is growing during the eruption. Internal bubble structure
cannot be captured by the Woods model. This behavior
is also consistent with a eruption picture of volcanology
study. Thus we conclude that the present model is a can-
didate of “an Ising model of Vulcanian eruption”.

To establish the present model, a quantitative study
is inevitable. For this purpose, we have to enlarge the
size of system; A transition from bubbly magma ﬂow
to magma dispersion ﬂow will be reproduced and stud-
ied by simulation of the system with ten times larger to
all directions. And the more details of volcanic eruption
not only Vulcanian but also Strombolian, and Plinian
will be elucidated. Present typical computational time is
approximately 80 hours for 208 896 particles with single
AMD opteron 248 (2.2GHz). Hence much larger simula-
tion is feasible with large super computers.

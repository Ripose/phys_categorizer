A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE EARTH

ABSTRACT

The possibility of an increasing gravitational constant (G) and its implications on the
earth’s history is discussed. The model is consistent with geophysical and astronomical
data. The number of days in a year in early epochs predicted by the model is in agreement
with those obtained from radiometric and fossil corals. The model considers the earth to be
cold in the beginning and it gradually heats as time evolves. Paleontology, paleotemperature,
paleogeophysics and paleobotany data are needed to restrict the law of variation of G. The
model predicts that the earth has undergone an evolutionary process resulting in its present
phase.

INTRODUCTION

In 1937 Dirac [1] proposed a model in which the gravitational constant G decreases with
time as G ∝ 1/t, but his model failed when confronted with observations. The possibility
of an increasing G has recently been considered by several workers [2,3,4]. In both cases the
variation of G is of the order of the Hubble constant (H). According to the theory of general
relativity (GR) the gravitational constant is constant. Hence any theory requires a change
of G would imply a change in GR. If G turns out to be varying with time then GR should
be revised. The supporters of GR however are reluctant to accept the idea of a varying G.
We will in this paper investigate the geologic implications of an increasing gravitational
constant G on the earth.
The best experimental upper limit on the present rate of change of the gravitational constant
G comes from the analysis of radar observations of Mercury and Venus. For a planet in a
circular orbit, around a central mass (M), of radius r and velocity v, we have MG = v2r,
so if the orbital angular momentum mvr stays ﬁxed while G changes, then r and v will vary
as [5]

and the orbital period T = 2πr/v will vary as

r ∝ 1/v ∝ 1/G

T ∝ 1/G2

The motion of a body moving under gravitational attraction would be aﬀected by the pres-
ence of a resisting medium. For a circular motion, this was shown to result in an increase
in the orbital velocity and a decrease in the orbit (r) [6]. By repeated comparison of the
orbital periods of the inner planets over the period 1966-69, with time as told by an atomic
clock (which does not depend on G), Shapiro et al have set an upper limit

| ˙G/G| < 4 × 10−10 year−1

This is almost good enough to rule out Dirac theory, but is not yet suﬃciently stringent
to put a useful limit on Brans-Dicke [7] theory coupling parameter ω. There was also a
prospect of setting an upper limit on the rate of change of G from analysis of the ﬂight time
of laser signals, sent from the earth to the moon, and reﬂected back to earth by the corner
reﬂectors placed on the moon’s surface by the Apollo expedition. Variation in G over the
last ﬁve millennia can perhaps be determined from the study of ancient eclipse records. It
may be possible to measure changes over the last 350 million years in the number of days
in lunar month or a year, by counting monthly or annual growth bands and daily growth
ridges on fossil coral. With decreasing G, the radius of the earth would increase roughly as
G−0.1 , causing complicated damage to the earth’s crust. If G were large in the past, then
stars would have run their thermonuclear evolution more rapidly. If G were greater in the
past, then the sun luminosity L would have been greater by a factor roughly proportional
to G8, and that the radius r of the earth orbit would have been smaller by a factor pro-
portional to G−1, so that the surface temperature of the earth, which varies more or less as
(L/r2)1/4, would have been greater by a factor G2.5. If G decreases as t−0.09, (Brans-Dicke,

ω = 6, G ∝ t−2/(4+3ω)) and if the age of the universe is 8 × 109years, then the temperature
of the earth’s surface 2 × 109 years ago would have been only 20oC higher than at present,
which need not have had any drastic eﬀect on biological evolution. On the other hand, if G
has decreased as 1/t (Dirac), then the temperature of the earth’s surface 109 years ago would
have been above the boiling point of water unless the earth’s albedo was very much higher
than at present. Thus too large an early value of G could have prevented the evolution of
life forms capable of invoking curiosity about the universe [8,5].
If G has varied with time, the geologic consequences will have been fundamental. For many
years the grounds for supposing that G changes with time were entirely philosophical, but
there is now some physical evidence that this conclusion is correct.

The Model

Recently, a cosmological model based on Einstein theory has been proposed [9,10]. The
model considers that the gravitational constant is increasing with time as G ∝ t(2n−1)/(1−n),
where n is the viscosity index ( 1
2 < n < 1) and that the age of the present universe is
tp = 1
For n = 0.7 , G ∝ t1.3 and tp = 1.1H −1
p . The radius of the earth
(R), temperature (θ), orbital velocity (v) , orbit (r), orbital period (T ), escape velocity (ve),
and the acceleration due to gravity (g) vary as [3,4]:

p . This gives ˙G/G = 1.2H −1

p , where Hp is the Hubble constant.

R ∼ G−0.1, θ ∼ G2.5, T ∼ G−2, v ∼ G, r ∼ G−1, ve ∼ G0.55, g ∼ G1.2 .

Based on these relations one can relate these parameters at two diﬀerent epochs viz.

where t′ = tp − ta, is the time measured from the beginning of the universe and the subscript

respectively.
Of primary importance, the model predicts that the temperature of the earth was 266K 400
millions ago while Dirac model gives 424K. Hence our model predicts that life could have
been possible in that epoch. The temperature-time relationship is plotted in Fig.(1), it shows
the slow warming of the earth. It was suggested by [11,12] that the earth probably formed
from accretion of cold planetetismals and therefore was initially homogeneous. However,
shortly after formation , the earth must have heated up so that it could diﬀerentiate or
separate into a core, mantle, and crust. Heating was the result of heat generated by impacts
during accretion, by gravitational compression, and by radioactive decay. Each in-falling
planetesimal carried a great deal of kinetic energy due its motion, a large part of which
was converted to heat upon impact. The rate of heat generated in this manner depended
upon the rate of accumulation and the velocity of planetesimal. As material accumulated
on the surface of the growing planet the inner parts of the planet were subjected to higher

3

and higher pressure which resulted in a proportional increase in temperature. Because rocks
are poor conductors of heat the temperature of the earth’s interior continued to rise. At
the same point iron began to melt and because of its high density began to sink towards
the center of the planet, forming the core. In Kuiper’s model [13] the earth is formed from
accumulation of materials in a cold (< −200oC) nebula. However, our model gives a value
of −218oC. At that time the earth was at roughly double its distance from the sun now.
The earth was in the position occupied by Mars some 3050 million years ago, therefore Mars
today could represent an earlier life’s history of the earth. Therefore, the knowledge of Mars
life conditions at the present time will help speculate about the history of the earth.
Because the variation of G is related to the age of the universe and to the deceleration
parameter of the universe, the geologic constraints for G would improve the knowledge
about the present universe. Equation (5) can be inverted to give a geologic time scale of the
earth (calendar).

Inserting a present age of the universe (11 × 109y) we, from eq.(5), tabulate the earth

data (Table 1) for the diﬀerent geologic periods.
Wells [14], using coral as an illustration, presented the idea that the ﬁne growth lines rep-
resented daily increments. He was able to infer the number of days in a year the time the
coral lived.
He noted that Astronomers believed the period of rotation of the earth around its polar axis
has been gradually slowing down due to a slight damping eﬀect of tidal forces on rotational
energy, and that in the course of geologic time the length of the day has been increasing and
the number of days in the year decreasing [15].
In our present model the length of the day (D) is varying as D ∝ G2 or D ∝ t2.6. It is
therefore clear that the length of the day was 21.9 hours 380 million years ago [12,14]. This
lengthening of the day is possibly due to the tidal eﬀects of the moon. Algal Stromatolites,
similar to types that today form chieﬂy in the inter-tidal zone were several centimeters high,
suggesting that the moon was present at least by then to inﬂuence tides. The increase in
heights of these Stromatolites would suggest a gradual decrease in the distance of the moon
from the earth as the cause of increased tides [17].

Fossils have great intrinsic interest as evidence of changes that the life of the earth has
undergone of the evolutionary process that has now produced the present biological environ-
ment. It was well known that the moon has inﬂuence on biological processes and that many
biological cycles are related to the phases of the moon [12].
Some experts attribute the rather high ”mortality” in marine invertebrates in Permian time
to cold climates and shrinking seas. By the same token the extinction of dinosaurs is likely
to be due to environmental changes and not due to any global catastrophe as many people
suggested.
Astronomical data indicate that the Cambrian year should have about 420 days, so that 400
days for the Devonian year in line with the astronomical calendar based on the theory of
decelerating rotation. It was found that ages inferred from fossil coral ( biological system)
generally agree with the radiometric time.
Wells emphasized that if more detailed studies supported his ideas, fossils with patterns of

4

additive growth were potentially useful chronometers of absolute time [14,16].
Plots of the temperature, number of days per year, earth’s radius, earth’s orbit and the
length of day versus time are shown in Fig.(1), Fig.(2), Fig.(3), Fig.(4) and Fig.(5), respec-
tively.
Working experimentally with the living quahog Mercenaria, Panella and Mac Clintock es-
tablished that the basic growth units of the shell were, indeed, daily increments. Moreover,
they found a number of distinct cycles patterns of increments, the most obvious being cycles
reﬂecting seasonal changes in series of thicker (summer) and thinner (winter) increments.
The O18/O16 ratios determined for successive concentric zones in that shell indicate rhyth-
mic ﬂuctuations of temperature from a winter low of about 15oC to a summer high of about
22oC. From these data it was deduced that animal lived some 140 million years ago [16].
Comparing this with our prediction we get a temperature of 14.7oC.

The number of days per year in the past (Table 1), according to the present model, shows
a complete agreement with the data obtained from fossil coral and radiometric time (Table
2).
According to our model, much of the internal heating of the earth is presumed to have
occurred subsequent to its aggregation through the gravitational attraction and radioactive
decay within the mass. The energy produced by such heating apparently has caused the
continual disturbances seen in earthquakes, volcanos, formation of mountain, and the like.
During the 19th century, geologist sought an explanation for diastrophism in a shrinking
earth.
It was then widely believed that the internal heat is a residue from a primordial
molten stages and that as it slowly cooled the earth began to solidify at the surface, thus
developed a rigid crust [15]. We, again, present the idea of a shrinking earth but on diﬀerent
ground. In our model the solidiﬁcation of the crust is due to an increase in the strength
of gravity with time. One of the immediate consequences of the shrinking earth is that the
sea-covering areas would increase and the continent would shrink as time evolves. Using the
Hubble constant Hp = 10−10y−1, the age of the universe tp = 11 × 109y, the deceleration
parameter (qp) of the universe is qp = 0.1.

For a planet to retain its atmosphere over billion years the escape velocity must be such
that vrms = 10ve, where vrms is the root mean square velocity of a given species. Using the
above relation, the atmospheric temperature Tatm is related to G by Tatm ∼ G1.1.
For instance, water under cool conditions react to form compounds that do not easily evapo-
rate, where as neon is chemically inert and remains a gas. Thus a cool primitive earth would
selectively retain water (and other chemically reactive gas like carbon dioxide and ammonia)
by locking them up as compounds in rock, where as inert gases like neon would gradually
escape. Thus life could have developed some billion years ago.

We remark that the appropriate law of variation of G has to be found from the variation
of the geologic parameters (earth’s radius, temperature, speed, etc.) with time. We have,
in this model, highlighted the implications of an increasing gravity on the evolution of the
earth.

Concluding Remarks

Thus, as a result of increasing gravity, the earth continues to shrink and speeds up in
its orbit while approaching the sun. Like the astronomical calendar which is based on the
theory of decelerating rotation, our model based on an increasing gravity can be used as
a calendar for the geologic time. The model predicts events that took place in the initial
state of the earth formation. We also predict that the sea-covering areas are increasing while
the continental areas are decreasing. Using the present age (Hubble) parameter as an input
one can predict the value of the Hubble (age) parameter of the universe. Paleotemperature,
paleoclimatology, paleogeophysics, paleogeography data will set appropriate limits on the
variability of G. The consequences of this variation will be very substantial in understand-
ing the history of the earth.

ABSTRACT

First principles linear response calculations are used to investigate the lattice dynamics of

what is thought to be the third most abundant phase in the lower mantle, CaSiO3

perovskite. The commonly assumed cubic structure (P m3m) is found to be dynamically

unstable at all pressures, exhibiting unstable modes along the Brillouin zone edge from the

M-point to the R-point. Based on these results, we predict that the ground state structure

of CaSiO3 perovskite is a distorted phase with lower than cubic symmetry. We predict

that a phase transition occurs in CaSiO3 perovskite within the earth’s lower mantle from

the low temperature distorted phase to the cubic phase at high temperature. The

predicted phase transition provides a possible explanation of some of the seismological

observations of reﬂective features within the lower mantle.

INTRODUCTION

CaSiO3 perovskite is thought to comprise between 6 and 12 weight % of the lower half

of the earth’s transition zone and lower mantle (depths between 500 and 2900 km) (Irifune

1994; O’Neill and Jeanloz 1990; Ita and Stixrude 1992). Its structure throughout this

regime is generally assumed to be cubic because x-ray diﬀraction studies have found no

detectable deviation from P m3m symmetry (Liu and Ringwood 1975; Mao et al. 1989;

Wang et al. 1996). Theoretical studies based on ionic models (Wolf and Jeanloz 1985;

Hemley et al. 1987; Wolf and Bukowinski 1992), periodic Hartree-Fock (Sherman 1993),

and pseudopotential calculations (Wentzcovitch et al. 1995) have supported this picture.

Here, we go beyond previous studies by investigating from ﬁrst principles the full

phonon spectrum of cubic CaSiO3 perovskite from low pressures to those typical of the

lower mantle. The calculations are based on the Linearized Augmented Plane Wave

(LAPW) method, widely accepted as among the most accurate methods for solving the

band structure/total energy problem. We ﬁnd that the cubic phase is dynamically

unstable at all pressures and that the ground state structure must possess lower than cubic

symmetry.

These results are important for our understanding of the physics and chemistry of this

mantle phase - its phase stability, elasticity, and its ability to incorporate other cations

such as Mg, Fe, and Al, for example, will be aﬀected by its symmetry. Moreover, the

existence of a low symmetry ground state raises the possibility of a temperature induced

phase transition in this mineral within the earth. Phase transitions in lower mantle

constituents have important implications for our understanding of recent seismological

observations of reﬂective features within the lower mantle (Revenaugh and Jordan 1991;

Kawakatsu and Niu 1994; LeStunﬀ et al. 1995) near 700, 900, and 1200 km depth. These

observations indicate the presence of previously unpredicted phase transitions or sharply

bounded compositional heterogeneities, challenging our traditional view of this region as

being compositionally and mineralogically homogeneous.

COMPUTATIONS

The LAPW linear response calculations determine the self-consistent ﬁrst order

response of the electronic charge density to generalized perturbations (Yu and Krakauer

1994). The calculations are based on density functional theory; the only essential

approximation is to the exchange-correlation potential. We use the well studied local

density approximation (LDA), which has been applied successfully in studies of silicates,

including Mg-perovskite (Stixrude and Cohen 1993). We compute the linear response to

shifts in nuclear positions and imposed external ﬁelds, which yield the elements of the

dynamical matrix, the dielectric constant (ǫ) and the Born eﬀective charges (Z ∗), from

which the phonon frequencies are determined (Yu and Krakauer 1995; Lee and Gonze

1994). The perturbations need not be commensurate with the unit cell, so that points in

the Brillouin zone away from the zone center are readily investigated. We calculate the

dynamical matrix of the cubic P m3m phase of CaSiO3 perovskite at four points in the

Brillouin zone (Γ, X, M, R). Computational variables (k-point mesh: 4x4x4 for

computations of the dynamical matrix elements, 8x8x8 for ǫ and Z ∗; number of basis

functions per atom

150) were chosen such that phonon frequencies are converged to

≈

better than one wavenumber. The full phonon dispersion curve is determined using an

interpolation scheme that separates short-range forces from long-range, Coulombic

interactions (Yu and Krakauer 1994; Gonze et al. 1994).

We ﬁnd that the Born eﬀective charges in CaSiO3 perovskite diﬀer signiﬁcantly from

formal ionic charges; by as much as 1e (Fig. 1). Compression causes Z ∗ of Si and Ca to

deviate farther from their formal ionic values, and Z ∗ of O to approach -2. The dielectric

constant, ǫ = 3.8 at zero pressure, lies between the known values for CaO (Lide and

Frederikse 1994) and SiO2 stishovite (Stishov and Popova 1961) and varies slowly with

pressure (Fig. 1). LO-TO splitting of zone-center vibrational frequencies is on the order of

50-200 wavenumbers (Fig. 2). All zone-center modes are found to be dynamically stable.

An examination of the eigenvectors shows that the highest frequency modes involve

stretching of the octahedral Si-O bond. The change in frequency of these modes with

compression is greatest because the length of the Si-O bond shrinks in direct proportion to

compression in the cubic structure.

The full phonon dispersion curves reveal dynamical instabilities in the cubic structure

along the zone boundaries (Fig. 2). Instabilities occur at the M- and R-points and along

the zone edges from M to R. The corresponding imaginary frequencies grow in magnitude

upon compression. An examination of the eigenvectors associated with these unstable

modes shows that they consist of coupled rotations of the SiO6 octahedra. The unstable

modes at the M-point (M2) and R-point (R25) are associated, respectively, with in-phase

and out-of-phase rotations of the octahedra about [100]. Instabilities along M-R were

previously found in ionic model calculations, but only at pressures (P ) above 80 GPa

(Hemley et al. 1987; Wolf and Bukowinski 1992). Here we ﬁnd that the instabilities are

more profound and that they persist even in the expanded lattice (P =-8 GPa). Unstable

modes of the same type have also been found in theoretical investigations of cubic MgSiO3

perovskite which account for the observed orthorhombic (P bnm) symmetry of this

material (Wolf and Jeanloz 1985; Hemley et al. 1987; Wolf and Bukowinski 1992).

Our results indicate that the cubic P m3m structure of CaSiO3 perovskite is

dynamically unstable and that the ground state of this material must possess lower

symmetry. However, the ground state is not of direct relevance to the lower mantle where

temperatures exceed 2000 K. Even if the cubic phase is dynamically unstable, it may be

thermodynamically stable at high temperature because of its greater entropy (e.g. Salje

1990).

The temperature at which the low temperature distorted phase transforms to the high

temperature cubic phase depends not only on the unstable mode frequencies, but also on

the energetics of ﬁnite displacements along the unstable mode eigenvectors. Using LAPW

total energy calculations, we ﬁnd the total energy as a function of displacement along the

4

most unstable mode eigenvector (R25) and the associated minimum energy displacement

[frozen phonon approach; Cohen 1992]. The symmetry of the structure associated with this

ﬁnite displacement is tetragonal I4/mcm, with 10 atoms in the unit cell. The results at

mid-mantle pressures (P =80 GPa) show that the minimum energy displacement

corresponds to an octahedral rotation angle of 7 degrees and is 360 K per octahedron lower

in energy than the cubic phase (Fig. 3). The relatively small minimum energy octahedral

rotation angle may explain why previous x-ray diﬀraction experiments have failed to detect

deviations from cubic symmetry. Assuming that the octahedral rotations are rigid

(O’Keefe et al. 1979), the corresponding c/a ratio of the distorted phase diﬀers by only 0.7

% from the cubic structure - below the detection limit of previous non-hydrostatic (Mao et

al. 1989) and quasihydrostatic (Wang et al. 1996) experiments (H. K. Mao, personal

communication).

These results constrain the parameters of a simple model which we use to estimate the

transition temperature from the distorted I4/mcm structure to the cubic P m3m structure.

The model (Bruce 1980) consists of on-site terms which correspond to ﬁnite displacements

along the unstable zone-boundary mode eigenvectors, and inter-site couplings

where U is the energy contained in octahedral rotations, Q is the normal coordinate of the

octahedral rotation, and V (Q) is the on-site term given by our total energy results

(Fig. 3). The form of the nearest-neighbor inter-site coupling term is determined by the

requirement that it vanish for a pure R25 mode distortion of the crystal, in which

neighboring octahedra rotate in opposite directions. The intersite coupling parameter, J,

is most simply given by the curvature along Γ-R of the unstable mode eigenenergy

evaluated at the R-point (Fig. 2). The relative magnitudes of the on-site and inter-site

coupling terms are such that the phase transition is expected to occur in the displacive

limit. In this case, if we ignore coupling between the unstable mode eigenvector and other

modes, the transition temperature is given by

Tc = 4

J|A|
kB B ≈

(2)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and q(3) = 0.5054. The estimated transition

temperature is similar to estimates of temperatures in the lower mantle at similar

pressures: P =80 GPa corresponds to a depth of 1850 km and a temperature of

approximately 2500-3000 K.

DISCUSSION

Our estimate of Tc may be uncertain by several hundred K and is likely to be a lower

bound since we have ignored coupling between unstable mode eigenvectors - this may lower

the total energy of the distorted phase further relative to the cubic phase. Nevertheless,

the fact that our estimated Tc is comparable to lower mantle temperatures indicates that a

phase transition in CaSiO3 perovskite is likely to occur in the lower mantle.

The predicted phase transition in CaSiO3 perovskite is expected to be associated with

an elastic anomaly which may be the cause of at least a subset of the reﬂective features

near 700, 900, and 1200 km depth in the lower mantle (Revenaugh and Jordan 1991;

Kawakatsu and Niu 1994; LeStunﬀ 1995). Other phase transitions have been discussed as

possibly occurring in the earth’s lower mantle. A phase transition in the lower mantle’s

most abundant constituent, MgSiO3 perovskite, has been suggested (Meade et al. 1995),

but theoretical computations show such a transition unlikely for reasonable geotherms

(Stixrude and Cohen 1993; Warren and Ackland 1996). Recent results show that SiO2

undergoes a phase transition from the stishovite to the CaCl2 structure at lower mantle

pressures (Cohen 1992; Kingma et al. 1995). Our results on CaSiO3 perovskite indicate

the presence of yet another phase transition within the lower mantle, the ﬁrst high

pressure phase transition predicted with the linear response method.

as shown by the existence of imaginary frequencies. The ﬁnal panel (M-R) shows that the

edges of the cubic Brillouin zone are everywhere unstable. The magnitude of the imaginary

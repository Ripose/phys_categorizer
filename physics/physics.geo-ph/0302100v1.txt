Abstract

Viscous heating plays an important role in the dynamics of ﬂuids with strongly temperature-

dependent viscosity because of the coupling between the energy and momentum equations. The

heat generated by viscous friction produces a local temperature increase near the tube walls

with a consequent decrease of the viscosity which may dramatically change the temperature

and velocity proﬁles. These processes are mainly controlled by the Pecl´et number, the Nahme

number, the ﬂow rate and the thermal boundary conditions. The problem of viscous heating

in ﬂuids was investigated in the past for its practical interest in the polymer industry, and

was invoked to explain some rheological behaviours of silicate melts, but was not completely

applied to study magma ﬂows. In this paper we focus on the thermal and mechanical effects

caused by viscous heating in tubes of ﬁnite lengths. We ﬁnd that in magma ﬂows at high

Nahme number and typical ﬂow rates, viscous heating is responsible for the evolution from

Poiseuille ﬂow, with a uniform temperature distribution at the inlet, to a plug ﬂow with a hotter

layer near the walls. When the temperature gradients induced by viscous heating are very

pronounced, local instabilities may occur and the triggering of secondary ﬂows is possible. For

completeness, this paper also describes magma ﬂow in inﬁnitely long tubes both at steady state

and in transient phase.

Introduction

A common feature of lava ﬂows is the presence of a complex network of lava tubes, observed both in

“pahoehoe” (Peterson et al., 1994) and ‘a‘a lava ﬁelds (Calvari and Pinkerton, 1998, 1999). The tube system

acts as an efﬁcient pathway for lava from the main vent to the ﬂow fronts, allowing great distances to

be reached. This is mostly due to the decrease of radiative cooling, as a consequence of a much lower

temperature of the outer crust of the tubes as compared to the temperature of the lava surface ﬂowing in

open channels (Dragoni, 1989; Dragoni et al., 1995).

The effects of heat generation by viscous friction for lava ﬂows in tubes and channels were often neglected

in previous models. In this work we show that these effects can play an important role in the dynamics

of ﬂuids with strongly temperature-dependent viscosity such as silicate melts and polymers. In fact, in

these ﬂuids, viscous friction generates a local increase in temperature near the tube walls with consequent

viscosity decrease and increase of the ﬂow velocity. This velocity increase produces a further growth of

the local temperature. As we will see later, there are some critical values of the parameters that control this

process above which this feedback cannot converge. In this case the one-dimensional laminar solution, valid

in the limit of inﬁnitely long pipe, cannot exist even for low Reynolds numbers. In pipes with ﬁnite length,

viscous heating governs the evolution from Poiseuille regime with a uniform temperature distribution at

the conduit inlet, to a plug ﬂow with a hotter boundary layer near the walls downstream. This effect could

be observed even in ﬂuids with null yield strength. When the temperature gradients, induced by viscous

heating are very pronounced, local instabilities occur and triggering of secondary ﬂows is possible.

Viscous heating was previously invoked to describe the rheological behaviour of basalts (Shaw, 1969) and

to explain some instabilities in the asthenosphere (Anderson and Perkins, 1974). Moreover (Fujii and Uyeda,

1974), adopting a model only valid for inﬁnitely long tubes (by the thermal point of view), explained the

size of intrusive dikes in volcanoes.

Because of the low thermal conductivity of silicate melts, the temperature ﬁeld shows a strong radial

gradient and viscosity layering. Flows with layers of different viscosity were investigated in the past,

also for their practical interest, and it is known that they are not always stable (Yih, 1967; Craik, 1969;

Renardy and Joseph, 1985; Renardy, 1987). The instabilities are generated by the viscosity contrasts, and

are similar to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities triggered by density gradients. In Couette ﬂows of ﬂuids

with temperature-dependent viscosity, Sukanek and Laurence (1974) and Yueh and Weng (1996) found one

instability mode related to the viscosity gradient at low Reynolds numbers. This kind of instability shows a

local character (Pearson, 1976) and is expected to occur also in lava ﬂows.

As we will see later, these processes are controlled principally by three parameters: the Pecl´et number

(P e), the Nahme number (N a0), and the adimensional ﬂow rate (q):

P e = ρcU H/k;

N a0 = µ0U 2β/k;

q = µ0Q/ρgH 3

(1)

with ρ density, c speciﬁc heat, U mean velocity, H tube radius, k thermal conductivity, µ0 reference vis-

cosity (N a0 is based on this value), β rheological parameter (see eq.5) and Q ﬂow rate per unit length

2

(Q = U H).

Viscous heating in lava and magma ﬂows is responsible for effects not described by simple isothermal

models, and may help in the understanding of some phenomena observed in lava ﬂows, which are not yet

clearly described. These include the surprising temperature increase at the base of pahoehoe ﬂows observed

by (Keszthelyi, 1995), the formation of the “roller vortex” (Booth and Self, 1973), thermal erosion at low

Reynolds numbers (Greeley et al., 1998), and the observation, in lava channels, of magma temperatures

greater than the eruption temperature at the vent (Kauahikaua et al., 1998). Recently, the results of the

studies of Polacci et al. (2001) suggest that the viscous heating may be responsible for the generation of a

heterogeneous distribution of magma properties inside the conduit. Moreover, the recent viscous gravity

currents model of Vasilyev et al. (2001), based on the conservation equations applied to a control volume,

shows that the viscous dissipation exerts a strong inﬂuence in the viscous gravity currents. Finally, inad-

equacy of simple conductive cooling models is shown by basal temperature measurements carried out by

Keszthelyi (1995). Temperature measurements recorded at the base of many ﬂows increases after some

initial cooling. This fact can be easily understood on the light of the model presented here.

We begin our study by investigating the limit case of ﬂows in inﬁnitely long tubes, and then we will

describe the ﬂow in tubes of ﬁnite length as being more representative of actual magma ﬂows. We ﬁnd that

viscous heating effects cannot be generally neglected in typical magma ﬂows and that the energy and mo-

mentum equations cannot be decoupled. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the characteristic plug-like velocity proﬁle

observed in magma ﬂows can be caused by viscous heating effects, even assuming Newtonian rheology.

2 Model description

In this paper, magma is assumed to be incompressible and approximated as an homogeneous ﬂuid with

constant density, speciﬁc heat and thermal conductivity. The viscosity, however, is temperature-dependent.

We investigate the ﬂow in a slab between two parallel boundaries separated by a distance 2H and inclined

of an angle α with respect to the horizontal (see Figure 1). For symmetry, the velocity is directed along the

ﬂow. At the tube walls (z = ±H) we impose a null velocity and a ﬁxed temperature. This last assumption

on the temperature is quite restrictive, and will be probably generalized in future works. However, for the

case of tube of ﬁnite length, we show also results obtained by assuming thermal adiabatic condition at the

walls, as a limit case.

When the Pecl´et number is very high, the lubrication approximation is valid: the transient term in the mo-

mentum equation is orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding term in the energy equation (their

ratio is of the order of the inverse of the Prandtl number). This means that the time scale for momentum

relaxation is much shorter that the corresponding time scale for thermal relaxation, and the time evolution

of the velocity and temperature proﬁles is controlled only by the energy equation. In these hypotheses,

magma dynamics in the tube are described by the following transport equations:

where z is the coordinate transversal to the ﬂow, x longitudinal coordinate, t time, (U, W ) velocity of the

ﬂuid in the directions x and z respectively, ρ density, P pressure, µ viscosity, g gravity acceleration, α

slope, c speciﬁc heat at constant pressure, T temperature, and k thermal conductivity. The last term in (3)

represents the heat generation by viscous dissipation.

The characteristic length scales of this problem are the channel dimensions 2H (thickness) and L (length),
the mechanical relaxation length Lm = U H 2ρ/µ0, and the thermal relaxation length Lt = U H 2ρc/k. For
lava ﬂows, typically Lm/L ≪ 1, but Lt/L ≫ 1 and the approximation of inﬁnitely long tube is not valid.
Only when Lt/L ≪ 1, the approximation of inﬁnitely long tube (by the thermal point of view) is allowed.
This limit case is simpler to handle, and it was widely studied in the past. For these reasons, we discuss

magma ﬂow in inﬁnitely long tubes, before studying the viscous heating effects in tubes of ﬁnite length.

In silicate melts the dependence of the viscosity on the temperature is well described by the Arrhenius

where µA is a constant and B is the activation energy. In the interval of temperatures (T − T0)/T0 ≪ 1
(T0 is a reference temperature), eq. (4) is well approximated by the (Nahme’s) exponential law:

with β = B/T 2

In this section we study the ﬂow in an inﬁnitely long channel (slab) driven only by the component of the

gravity force acting along the ﬂow (all gradients are null along the ﬂow). We assume no-slip conditions

(U = 0), constant temperature (T = Tw) at the walls (z = ±H) and, for simplicity, we choose the
reference temperature T0 = Tw. Under these hypotheses, eq. (2) and (3) reduce to:

In a previous work, Pearson (1977) considered a Poiseuille ﬂow between two horizontal parallel planes with

isothermal boundaries (the temperature at the boundaries is the same as that of the injected ﬂuid), negligible

transversal gradients, and a given ﬂow rate. Previously, a similar problem (the Hagen-Poiseuille ﬂow) was

numerically solved using analogue computers by Gruntfest et al. (1964), and later Eckert and Faghri (1986)

studied the Couette ﬂow. Like Pearson (1977), Gruntfest et al. (1964) found that during the transient phase,

in contrast to the steady-state, the temperature proﬁle shows higher values near the walls than in the channel

centre. Moreover, Gruntfest et al. (1964) found that the solutions of the equations that they consider do not
diverge only when the adimensional pressure gradient Gp (Gp = β(dP/dx)2H 4/kµ0) is smaller than a
critical value. In fact for Gp greater than this value, the temperature increases indeﬁnitely in a ﬁnite time.
Gruntfest et al. (1964) suggest that the behaviour of this model can help in understanding the origin of

turbulence (however this feedback could not produce an indeﬁnite temperature increase in 2-D and 3-D

systems).

Next we investigate the time-dependent problem of a ﬂuid with initial temperature Ti, and wall tempera-
ture Tw = T0, with Ti ≥ T0. We study the conditions for the existence of the solution, and the evolution to
the steady-state solution (when it exists). After combining eq. (6) and (7), we rewrite the energy equation

in the adimensional form:

The parameter G represents the adimensional “shear stress”, and is known as the Nahme number based on

the characteristic stress (instead of the velocity).

From the results of Gruntfest et al. (1964) we know that when B = 0 and G > Gcrit (Gcrit ≈ 5.64 for
slab ﬂows), the solution of eq. (8) diverges in a ﬁnite time. In the case of G < Gcrit, the solution of the
transient phase, with two maxima near the walls, evolves for τ ≈ 1 to the steady-state solution with only

one maximum in the channel centre. In Figure 3 and Figure 2 we report the temporal evolution of θ found

numerically for the subcritical condition (G = 5), and for the supercritical condition (G = 8) respectively,
both with B = 0. As shown in Figure 3, when G < Gcrit, for small τ the temperature increases near the
boundaries and for τ ≈ 1 its proﬁle tends to the steady-state solution. In Figure 2, in the supercritical case,

the temperature proﬁle, shows two peaks near the walls that continuously increase, until they diverge when

τ reaches a critical value τcrit.

The general case, with the initial ﬂuid temperature greater than the temperature at the walls (B > 0),

was previously studied by Fujita (1969) from a theoretical point of view, but is not yet analytically or

numerically solved (to our knowledge). Fujita (1969) clariﬁed the relationship between the transient and

the steady-state phases with some theorems for the steady-state boundary value problem:

∇2u + eu = 0

(x ∈ Ω)

(11)

5

and for the corresponding time-dependent problem:

∂u
∂t

= ∇2u + eu

(t ≥ 0, x ∈ Ω)

(12)

with initial condition u(t = 0) = a(x) (with a(x) continuous), and boundary condition u(∂Ω) = 0. One

of the theorems states that if eq. (11) has no solution, then the solutions of eq. (12) diverge in a ﬁnite time,

or diverge for t → ∞. Another theorem states that if eq. (11) has more than one solution, φ is the “smaller”

solution, and ψ is another solution not equal to φ, then:

1. If a > ψ, then the solution u of eq. (12) diverges, in a ﬁnite time, or for t → ∞.

2. If a < ψ, then the solution u of eq. (12) uniformly converges to φ, for t → ∞.

From our numerical solutions of eq. (8), we observe that when B > 0, the range of values of G below

which the solution of eq. (8) converges is smaller than the corresponding range of G for B = 0, but the
proﬁles evolution is similar to the case with B = 0. We call Gcrit(B) the critical value of G above which
the solution diverges when the initial condition is B. An example is reported in Figure 5 for G = 4 and
B = 3 where the temperature diverges in a ﬁnite time. Figure 6 shows the relation between B and Gcrit(B)
For B > 0 we study the following two cases: in the subcritical case (G < Gcrit) we
found numerically.
investigate the effect of the viscous heating on the temporal evolution of the temperature proﬁle, and we

compare the results to the case without heat generation (G = 0); in the supercritical case, we investigate
the relation between the critical time corresponding to the thermal blow-up τcrit and G. When the viscous
heating is neglected, eq. (8) reduces to the classical heat equation. In fact from an initial condition with

uniform temperature greater than that of the boundaries, the ﬂuid starts cooling near the walls, until the

wall temperature is reached in a time scale of the order of the characteristic time, i.e τ ∼ 1. By accounting

for the viscous heating, as shown, for example, in Figure 4, the temporal evolution of the temperature can

be described in four phases. The initial phase is characterized by the cooling near the walls; in the second

phase the viscous heating near the walls produces the increase of the temperature above its initial value and

the temperature proﬁle assumes two maxima in the external part of the proﬁle and a minimum in the central

part. During the third phase the two maxima migrate towards the central part of the channel, and the proﬁle

is characterized by a maximum temperature in the centre, that could be also greater than its initial value. In

the fourth phase the ﬂuid cools until the steady state solution is reached, in agreement with the theoretical

results of Fujita (1969), previously reported.

In the supercritical case (G > Gcrit), we ﬁnd an adimensional critical time τcrit above which the solution
diverges. In this case, the temporal evolution of the temperature proﬁle is qualitatively similar to the corre-

sponding case with B = 0, but with shorter τcrit. The temperature increases near the walls until it diverges
as τ → τcrit (similar to the case shown in Figure 5). As G increases, τcrit gets shorter. As an example,
Figure 7 shows the relation between G and τcrit, for B = 0.

From the physical point of view, when viscous heating is relevant, a transversal temperature gradient

develops near the walls to dissipate the heat through the boundaries. This temperature increase produces

6

a viscosity decrease with a consequent increase of the ﬂow velocity. This velocity increase produces an

increase in the velocity gradients near the walls, and a further local temperature increase. When G > Gcrit,
the temperature increases without bound this feedback cannot converge and the steady-state solution does

not exist. Of course, this has no physical meaning, and is related to the loss of validity of some assumptions

such as the hypothesis of one-dimensional laminar ﬂow. When the inﬁnitely long pipe hypothesis is valid,

according to Gruntfest et al. (1964), it is legitimate to assume that above the critical values (Gcrit, τcrit),
other diffusive processes are triggered, allowing a more efﬁcient heat and momentum transfer.

Instead, when G < Gcrit, the temperature and velocity proﬁles tend to the steady-state solutions described

by:

d2θ
dζ2 + Geθζ2 = 0
Eq. (13) was widely studied in the past, and it is well known that it has no solutions for G > Gcrit, where
Gcrit is a critical value (Joseph, 1964). Below the critical value, for each G there are two solutions corre-
sponding to different temperature proﬁles: one at low temperature, and one at high temperature (see Fig-

(13)

ure 8). For some years, the existence of double solutions corresponding to a given “shear-stress” G was dis-

cussed in the literature, and the stability of the solution in the higher branch was investigated. This depends

on which is the controlling variable of the problem: the velocity or the shear stress (John and Narayanan,

1997). A complete review on this argument until 1974 is reported by Sukanek and Laurence (1974), and

more recently by Becker and McKinley (2000). In summary, in the Poiseuille ﬂow between two parallel

planes, when the adimensional “shear-stress” parameter G is greater than a critical value Gcrit(≃ 5.64),
eq. (13) has no solutions; for G = Gcrit it has one solution; and for G < Gcrit it has two solutions, one
of which (the one with greater temperature) may be unstable. For G < Gcrit, typical proﬁles of the adi-
mensional temperature θ, and velocity u/U0 that satisfy (6), (7) and the imposed boundary conditions, are

characterized by a maximum in the centre of the tube.

2.2 Finite length tube

From the thermal point of view, magma ﬂows at high Pecl´et number cannot be described by assuming

inﬁnitely long tubes. At high Pecl´et numbers, the leading term in the left side of eq. (3) is the advective

term, containing the longitudinal gradient of the temperature (e.g. Lawal and Kalyon, 1997). Including only

the relevant terms, the transport equations (mass, momentum and energy balance) for ﬁnite length tubes, in

adimensional form are:

where N a∗ and P e∗ are the Nahme and the Pecl´et numbers based on the characteristic velocity U ∗ re-
spectively and Q = U H. The equation describing mass conservation is written in integral form. To solve

the equations in (14), we assume no-slip conditions for the velocity and constant temperature Tw at the

walls. At the inlet we assume a parabolic velocity proﬁle and constant temperature Tin. Here, for sim-

plicity and according to other authors, we consider the wall temperature as reference, i.e. T0 = Tw and
B = β(Tin − Tw). From an operative point of view, it would probably be more convenient to set the
reference temperature equal to the temperature at the inlet. Of course, the physical behaviour of the ﬂow is

independent of the choice of the reference temperature T0; this is obtained by rescaling all the parameters.
As an example, by assuming T0 = Tin, the viscosity needs to be rescaled by a factor eB, etc.

Recently, Lawal and Kalyon (1997) found analytical solutions of the simpler problem with constant vis-

cosity and showed typical temperature proﬁles with two peaks near the walls. In our case, since we consider

temperature-dependent viscosity, we expect a feedback on the velocity proﬁle. In fact, using asymptotic so-

lution method for high Nahme numbers, Ockendon (1979) solved the eq. (14) taking in to consideration

the full advective term. These solutions describe the evolution of a ﬂow from the Poiseuille regime with

uniform temperature at the conduit inlet to a plug regime characterized by two peaks in the temperature

proﬁle near the boundaries far from the inlet. Since the ratio Lt/Lm (equal to the Prandtl number) is very

high, it is legitimate to assume that the ﬂow is fully developed, by the mechanical point of view, almost

at the tube inlet. The characteristic distance from the inlet where the viscous heating becomes relevant, is
ξ∗ ∼ P eN a−3/2 (Ockendon, 1979) (using data from Table 1 this gives 50 ÷ 5000m for a conduit width

of 5m). Under more general conditions, Schneider (1976) found numerical solutions of the viscous heating

problem, showing clearly that the deviation from the Newtonian behaviour may have a thermal origin in

ﬂuids with temperature-dependent viscosity. When the viscous dissipation becomes important, its effect

overcomes the thermal cooling from the walls producing a maximum in the temperature proﬁle near the

walls and a consequent plug-like velocity distribution. These effects increase with distance from the inlet

and, unexpectedly, the maximum temperature gets more pronounced when the temperatures at the walls get

lower. Similar results were obtained by Galili et al. (1975) using perturbative methods: they found that the

ﬂow rate is not proportional to the longitudinal pressure gradient and the apparent viscosity of a Newtonian

ﬂuid depends on the shear rate because of the viscous dissipation.

We solve eq. (14) by using a ﬁnite-difference method with an implicit scheme for the integration along

direction ξ; the pressure gradient is iteratively adjusted at each step in order to satisfy mass conservation.

8

For symmetry we investigate only half a channel (0 ≤ ζ ≤ 1). We ﬁnd that the process is controlled by four
parameters: a Pecl´et number P e, a Nahme number N a∗, the adimensional ﬂow rate q, and the adimensional
input temperature B. However, since we focus on magma ﬂows in tubes, we set P e = 107 as a typical value,

and we perform a parametric study on the others.

In Figure 9 and 10, we show a solution of eq. (14) for different adimensional distance from the inlet:
from ξ = 0 to ξ = 104. Starting with uniform temperature (θ = 0) and parabolic velocity proﬁle at the
inlet, the ﬂow evolves gradually to a plug-like velocity proﬁle with two symmetric peaks in the temperature
distribution. In this case we used N a∗ = 100, q = 1 and B = 0 and the viscous dissipation effects become
important only for high values of ξ. Instead in Figure 11 and 12 the solutions for N a∗ = 1000, q = 1 and
B = 0 are shown; these results are qualitatively similar to the previous ones but the temperature peaks are

more pronounced and the length scale for the development of the plug ﬂow is lower than before (practically,

the transition occurs for ξ = 1000).

When the viscous heating is important with B > 0, the typical temperature proﬁle shows low values at the

walls with peaks near the walls, as reported in Figure 13. As shown in Figure 14, starting with a parabolic

velocity proﬁle at the inlet (ξ = 0), the ﬂow migrates to a plug-like regime downstream. By increasing B,

the peak in the temperature proﬁle moves towards the centre of the channel.

In general, viscous heating becomes important when either the Nahme number (N a∗) or the adimensional
For comparison, in Figure 15 and 16, we show the evolution of the temperature

and velocity proﬁles in a case similar to Figure 9 and 10, but with adiabatic thermal conditions at the walls.

In this case, as expected, the temperature increases more than the case of isothermal walls, and the the

velocity proﬁle shows a more pronounced plug-like behaviour.

2.3 Velocity ﬁeld stability and secondary ﬂows

The energy equation of ﬂuids with temperature-dependent viscosity in inﬁnitely long ﬂows is similar to the

equation which governs chemical explosive processes in some materials (described by the Frank-Kame-

netski equation, [1939]). In this last case, when the parameter corresponding to G is greater than its critical

value, ignition occurs. In ﬂuids, however, other multidimensional degrees of freedom can be activated

without the occurrence of extreme events. For example, in ﬂows between two parallel planes, cylindrical

secondary ﬂows can develop near the walls, or toroidal secondary ﬂows can occur in circular pipes.

Due to the strong coupling between viscosity and temperature, the thermal instability generated by vis-

cous heating may trigger an instability in the velocity ﬁeld, which cannot be predicted by a simple isother-

mal newtonian models. When the viscous heating produces sharp peak in the temperature proﬁle near the

walls, with consequent strong increase in the viscosity gradient, a triggering of instabilities and the transi-

tion to secondary ﬂows (with more efﬁcient thermal and mechanical diffusion) is possible. The stability of

the plane Couette ﬂow was recently re-examined by Yueh and Weng (1996), who improve the results pre-

viously found by Sukanek et al. (1973). The ﬂow shows two different instability modes: the former arises

in the non-viscous limit, and the latter is due to the viscosity stratiﬁcation (Yueh and Weng, 1996). For

9

this last instability mode, it is demonstrated that the critical Reynolds number (Rec), above which the ﬂow

becomes turbulent, decreases with the increase of the Nahme number (N a), that is with the viscous heat-

ing. This behaviour is conﬁrmed by recent experiments performed by White and Muller (2000). In these

experiments, the authors use a temperature-dependent ﬂuid (glycerin) and a Taylor-Couette device which

allows the tracking of vortex by a laser particle tracer. Results clearly show that, above a critical Nahme

number, an instability appears at a Reynolds number one order of magnitude lower than the corresponding

Reynolds number predicted for isothermal ﬂow.

Moreover, the triggering of the instability in the laminar ﬂow and the activation of new secondary ﬂows

are conﬁrmed by our 2-D direct numerical simulations of the complete Navier-Stokes equations, which will

be the subject of a further work.

Implications for lava ﬂows

In this section we apply the previous theoretical results to the study of lava and magma ﬂows in tubes. We

take the typical magma parameters reported in Table 1 as representative, but the obtained results can be

easily generalized.

Following Bruce and Huppert (1989), Tw is the temperature at the wall, which is deﬁned as the temper-

ature at which crystallization of magma ceases the ﬂow. Here, we estimate Tw as the temperature in the
mid-range between Tin and the solidiﬁcation temperature Ts: therefore, we use T0 = Tw ≈ 1273K. From
this value of Tw and from the values of β and Tin, reported in Table 1, we have B = β(Tin − Tw) ≈ 4
and µ0 = µ(Tin) · eB ≈ 30, 000 Pa s. Using the other values reported in Table 1, we obtain the following
characteristic adimensional numbers:

The last three numbers in eq. (18) are the Nahme, the Reynolds and the Prandtl numbers based on µ(Tin),

respectively, and are reported just for completeness.

The values of the adimensional numbers reported in (18) allow for the application of the model described

above for lava and magma ﬂows. In fact, the high Pecl´et number results in a very fast advective transport

and validates the assumption of the lubrication theory. Concerning the effects of viscous heating on magma

ﬂows, we found that for the lower value of the adimensional ﬂow rate considered in our study (q = 1)
and N a∗ = N a0/q2 . 1000, the cooling effects prevail on the viscous heating. This becomes dominant
for N a∗ ∼ 104 showing velocity and temperature proﬁles similar to those reported in Figure 13 and 14.

10

Instead, at high ﬂow rates (q = 10), the corresponding values of N a∗ are lower: the viscous heating effects
are dominant even at N a∗ ∼ 100 whereas for N a∗ . 10 cooling effects prevail. Since these conditions are
usual in magma ﬂows, it should be possible to observe viscous heating effects in the natural environment.

For magma ﬂows in eruptive conduits, recently, Polacci et al. (2001) emphasized the importance of the

viscous heating in magma ﬂow during volcanic eruptions to explain the creation and the discharge of two

different varieties of pumice. In their scheme, one type of pumice originates in the region with greater

temperature and higher strain rate near the conduit walls, whereas the other type is generated in the central

part of the conduit with lower strain rate and temperature.

For lava ﬂows, ﬁeld evidences corresponding to the starting of secondary ﬂows, previously described, are

possibly represented by the “roller vortex” phenomenon (Booth and Self, 1973) and by the thermal erosion

observed by Greeley et al. (1998) where the authors ﬁnd “unequivocal evidence for thermal erosion” in lava

tubes at Cave Basalt, Mt. St.Helens for which the dynamic analysis indicates laminar ﬂows. It is known

that the turbulent ﬂow is more effective in erosion than the laminar ﬂow because of the higher heat transfer

rate (Hulme, 1973; Greeley et al., 1998); moreover preliminary studies show that purely thermal erosion by

laminar ﬂow is very difﬁcult unless the substrate is of much lower melting temperature than the eroding ﬂuid

(Greeley et al., 1998). Field studies report that during the Kilauea eruption in 1994, lava eroded 5 meters

of the basaltic substrate with an average erosion rate of 10 cm/day at low Reynolds numbers between 16

and 64 (Kauahikaua et al., 1998). Such high erosion rates highlight the difﬁculties that arise when trying

to explain thermal erosion in laminar ﬂows. Moreover, Kauahikaua et al. (1998) show that the Jeffreys

equation that relates the velocity and the ﬂow depth in a laminar ﬂow is less adequate than other relations

valid for turbulent ﬂows such as the equation of Goncharov-Chezy, even for ﬂows at low Reynolds numbers.

Concerning the temperature, Kauahikaua et al. (1998) report the interesting and puzzling observations of

some temperature measurements greater than the magma temperature at the vent and even greater that
the upper limit of the temperature range of the used radiometer (about 1200 oC). An explanation of this

phenomenon could be the local increase of temperature near the walls caused by the viscous heating, as

previously described. Other authors also report the evidence of vortices associated with the beginning of

turbulence in active lava ﬂows at Kilauea (Keszthely and Self, 1998). The inadequacy of pure laminar ﬂows

to explain ﬁeld observation such as mixing and streamlines breaking has benn well known since the sixties

when the not widely accepted term of “disrupted ﬂow” was introduced to describe a ﬂow with characteristics

between pure laminar and turbulent (for a discussion see Baloga et al., 1995). Moreover basal temperature

measurements carried out by Keszthelyi (1995) show that temperature at the base of some ﬂows increases

after some initial cooling. This behaviour cannot be predicted by a simple conductive model but can be

explained using a correct physical model which correctly describes viscous heating effects.

At Etna, during the eruption of 1971, secondary rotational ﬂows were observed near the walls in ﬂows

conﬁned between levees or in deep channels (Booth and Self, 1973). These secondary ﬂows consist of two

elicoidal patterns symmetrical to the centre of the ﬂow. Booth and Self (1973), because of the low Reynolds

number, exclude any turbulent ﬂow, and try to explain these rotational ﬂows invoking other causes and

11

other, sometimes weak, argumentations. We think that the observed phenomena reported by Booth and Self

(1973) could be interpreted as the secondary ﬂows triggered by a pronounced viscous heating. The ro-

tational ﬂows, which allow the mixing of the ﬂuid along sections orthogonal to the direction of the ﬂow,

invoked in the model of lava ﬂows with two thermal components by Crisp and Baloga (1990), could have a

similar interpretation.

Moreover, exploration and investigations on terrestrial planets and satellites demonstrated that their lava

channels are typically larger than the corresponding channels on the Earth. To account for the large sizes

of lunar and martian channels Hulme (1973, 1982) and Carr (1974) proposed that lavas eroded the ground

over which they ﬂowed (see also Baloga et al. (1995)). Our model could be used to investigate whether the

action of secondary ﬂows caused by viscous heating could have eroded the preﬂow surface more efﬁciently

than laminar ﬂows.

We wish to remark that the proposed model is applicable to slab ﬂows, but it easily generalizable to

ﬂows in circular pipes. Moreover, modeling of lava ﬂows needs also the study of open channels with free

surface and different types of thermal boundary conditions, not considered in the present study. Finally,

an accurate study of the ﬂow instabilities and the triggering of secondary ﬂows needs the solution of the

complete transport equations in 2-D or 3-D (subject of a further work in preparation).

4 Conclusions

The effects of viscous heat generation in ﬂuids with strongly temperature-dependent viscosity such as sil-

icate melts are investigated. These effects can play an important role in the dynamics of magma ﬂow in

conduits and lava ﬂows in tubes. In fact, viscous friction generates a local increase in temperature near

the tube walls, with consequent increase of the ﬂuid velocity because of the viscosity decrease. In the case

of inﬁnitely long tubes, one-dimensional models predict that viscous heating can lead to a positive feed-

back known as “thermal runaway”. Actually, as described by 2-D and 3-D models, this feed-back causes

the activation of other degrees of freedom, with the production of local instabilities and the triggering of

secondary ﬂows. However, the typical high value of the Pecl´et number in magma ﬂows does not allow

the assumption of an inﬁnitely long tube (from the thermal point of view), and a model for magma ﬂow

in tubes of ﬁnite length is needed, as described in the paper. In general, this process is controlled by the

value of the Nahme number, the ﬂow rate, the Pecl´et number, and the thermal conditions at the inlet. By

adopting such a model, and typical values of the parameters for lava ﬂows in tubes, we ﬁnd that starting

from a constant temperature and parabolic velocity proﬁle at the tube inlet, viscous heating causes the in-

crease of the temperature near the walls, with a consequent local viscosity decrease. This can lead to the

formation of a plug-like velocity proﬁle, commonly observed in lava ﬂows, and explained only by assuming

a Binghamian rheology. Moreover, the presence of an inﬂex in the velocity proﬁle near the walls can lead

to the formation of local ﬂow instabilities, even at low Reynolds numbers. The assumption of isothermal

boundary conditions at the walls, although simplifying, is probably too restrictive; however, by assuming

adiabatic conditions, the qualitative character of the ﬂow does not seem to change dramatically in tubes of

ﬁnite length. We hope that this work will provide a motivation for further theoretical and ﬁeld investigations

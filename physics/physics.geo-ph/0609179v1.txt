The Multifractal Stress-Activated (MSA) model is a sta-
tistical model of triggered seismicity based on mechanical
and thermodynamic principles.
It predicts that, above a
triggering magnitude cut-oﬀ M0, the exponent p of the
Omori-Utsu law for the seismic decay of aftershocks is a
linear increasing function p(M ) = aM + b of the mainshock
magnitude M [Ouillon and Sornette, 2005]. First empirical
support for this prediction has been presented for the South-
ern California SCEC catalog. Here, we conﬁrm this law on
the worlwide Harvard CMT and the Japanese JMA catalogs,
with similar ranges of variation from p(M = 3) = 0.7 ± 0.1
to p(M = 8) = 1.1 ± 0.2. However, the statistically signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerences of the slopes a, intercepts b and cut-oﬀs M0
suggest diﬀerent multifractal properties of the three cata-
logs, likely associated with diﬀerent thermal and mechanical
properties.

1. Introduction

The popular concept of triggered seismicity reﬂects the
growing consensus that earthquakes interact through a vari-
ety of ﬁelds (elastic strain, ductile and plastic strains, ﬂuid
ﬂow, dynamical shaking and so on). The concept of trig-
gered seismicity was ﬁrst introduced from mechanical con-
siderations, by looking at the correlations between the spa-
tial stress change induced by a given event (generally quoted
as a mainshock), and the spatial location of the seismicity
that appeared to be temporally correlated with, and fol-
lowing, that main event (the so-called aftershocks) [King et
al., 1994; Stein, 2003]. Complementarily, purely statistical
models have been introduced to take account of the fact that
the main event is not the sole event to trigger some others,
but that aftershocks may also trigger their own aftershocks
and so on. Those models, of which the ETAS (Epidemic
Type of Aftershock Sequences) model [Kagan and Knopoﬀ,
1981; Ogata, 1988] is a standard representative with good
explanatory power [Saichev and Sornette, 2006], unfold the
cascading structure of earthquake sequences. This class of
models show that real-looking seismic catalogs can be gen-
erated by using a parsimonious set of parameters.

Very few eﬀorts have been devoted to bridge both ap-
proaches, so that a statistical mechanics of seismicity based
on physical principles could be built. Dieterich [1994] has
considered both the spatial complexity of stress increments
due to a main event and one possible physical mechanism

that may be the cause of the time-delay in the aftershock
triggering, namely state-and-rate friction. Dieterich’s model
predicts that aftershocks sequences decay with time as t−p
with p ≃ 1 independently of the mainshock magnitude, a
value which is often observed but only for sequences with
a suﬃciently large number of aftershocks triggered by large
earthquakes, typically for main events of magnitude 6 or
larger. Dieterich’s model has in particular the drawback
of neglecting the stress changes due to the triggered events
themselves and cannot be considered as a consistent theory
of triggered seismicity.

Recently, two of us [Ouillon and Sornette, 2005; Sor-
nette and Ouillon, 2005] have proposed a simple physical
model of self-consistent earthquake triggering, the Multi-
fractal Stress-Activated (MSA) model, which takes into ac-
count the whole deformation history due to seismicity. This
model assumes that rupture at any scale is a thermally ac-
tivated process in which stress modiﬁes the energy barriers.
This formulation is compatible with all known models of
earthquake nucleation, and in particular contains the state-
and-rate friction mechanism as a particular case. At any
given place in the domain, the seismicity rate λ is given
by λ(t) = λ0 exp(σ(t)/σT ), where σ(t) is the total local
stress at time t and σT = kT /V is an activation stress de-
ﬁned in terms of the activation volume V and an eﬀective
temperature T (k is the Boltzmann constant). Among oth-
ers, Ciliberto et al. [2001] and Saichev and Sornette [2005]
have shown that the presence of frozen heterogeneities, al-
ways present in rocks and in the crust, has the eﬀect of
renormalizing and amplifying the temperature through the
cascade of micro-damage to the macro-rupture, while con-
serving the same Arrhenius structure of the activation pro-
cess. The prefactor λ0 depends on the loading rate and
the local strength. The domain is considered as elasto-
visco-plastic with a large Maxwell time τM . For t < τM ,
the model assumes that the local stress relaxes according
to h(t) = h0/(t + c)1+θ, where c is is a small regularizing
time scale. The local stress σ(t) depends on the loading rate
at the boundaries of the domain and on the stress ﬂuctua-
tions induced by all previous events that occurred within
that domain. At any place, any component s of the stress
ﬂuctuations due to previous events is considered to follow
a power-law distribution P (s)ds = C/(s2 + s2
0)(1+µ)/2ds.
For µ(1 + θ) ≃ 1, Ouillon and Sornette [2005] found that
(i) a magnitude M event will be followed by a sequence
of aftershocks which takes the form of an Omori-Utsu law
with exponent p, (ii) this exponent p depends linearly on the
magnitude M of the main event and (iii) there exists a lower
magnitude cut-oﬀ M0 for mainshocks below which they do
not trigger. In contrast with the phenomenological statis-
tical models such as the ETAS model, the MSA model is
based on ﬁrm mechanical and thermodynamical principles.
Ouillon and Sornette [2005] has tested this prediction on
the SCEC catalog over the period from 1932 to 2003. Using
a superposed epoch procedure to stack aftershocks series
triggered by events within a given magnitude range, they
found that indeed the p-value increases with the magnitude
M of the main event according to pS(M ) = aSM + bS =

aS(M − M0,S), where aS = 0.10 ± 0.01(1std), bS = 0.37 ±
0.06(1std), M0,S = −3.5 ± 1.0(1std). The error bars are
obtained by using a bootstrap technique described below,
which allows us to show that the hypothesis that aS = 0
can be rejected with a conﬁdence level close to 100%, con-
ﬁrming that there exists a very signiﬁcant increasing linear
relationship between p and M for earthquakes recorded in
the SCEC catalog. Performing the same analysis on syn-
thetic catalogs generated by the ETAS model for which p is
by construction independent of M did not show an increas-
ing p(M ), suggesting that the results obtained on the SCEC
catalog reveal a genuine multifractality which is not biased
by the method of analysis.

Here, we extend the analysis to other areas in the world
(the worlwide Harvard CMT catalog and the Japanese JMA
catalog), to put to test again the theory and to check
whether the parameters a and b are universal or on the con-
trary vary systematically from one catalog to the other, per-
haps revealing meaningful physical diﬀerences between the
seismicity of diﬀerent regions.

2. The worlwide Harvard CMT and the
Japanese JMA catalogs

The worldwide CMT Harvard catalog used here goes from
January 1977 to December 2003 inclusive. This catalog is
considered to be complete for events of magnitude 5.5 or
larger. We thus deleted events below this threshold before
searching for the aftershocks. Due to the rather small num-
ber of events in this catalog, we did not impose any limit on
the depth of events.

◦
E in longitude and 30

The JMA catalog used here covers a much longer period
from May 1923 to January 2001 inclusive. We restricted our

analysis to the zone (130
◦
to 45
N in latitude), so that its northern and eastern bound-
aries ﬁt with those of the catalog, while the southern and
eastern boundaries ﬁt with the geographic extension of the
main japanese islands. This choice selects the earthquakes
with the best spatial location accuracy, close to the inland
stations of the seismic network. In our analysis, the main-
shocks are taken from this zone and in the upper 70km, while
we take into account their aftershocks which occur outside
and at all depths.

Our detailed analysis of the aftershock series at spatial
scales down to 20km uncovered a couple of zones where large
as well as small main events are not followed by the standard
Omori-Utsu power-law relaxation of seismicity. The results
concerning these zones will be presented elsewhere. Here,
we simply removed the corresponding events from the anal-
ysis. The geographical boundaries of these two anomalous
◦
◦
zones are [130.25
N] for the
E; 130.375
◦
ﬁrst zone, and [138.75
N] for the sec-
ond one (the so-called Izu islands area). This last zone is
particularly known to be the locus of earthquakes swarms
which may explain the observed anomalous aftershock re-
laxation. We have been conservative in the deﬁnition of this
zone along the latitude dimension so as to avoid possible
contamination in the data analysis which would undermine
the needed precise quantiﬁcation of the p-values.

The completude of the JMA catalog is not constant in
time, as the quality of the seismic network increased more
recently. We computed the distribution of event sizes year
by year, and used in a standard way [Kagan, 2003] the
range over which the Gutenberg-Richter law is reasonably
well-obeyed to infer the lower magnitude of completeness.
For our analysis, we smooth out the time dependence of
the magnitude threshold Mc above which the JMA catalog
can be considered complete from roughly Mc(1923) = 6, to
Mc(1930 − 1960) = 5, Mc(1960 − 1990) = 4.5 with a ﬁnal
progressive decrease to Mc = 2.5 for the most recent past.
This time-dependence of the threshold Mc(t) will be used
for the selection of mainshocks and aftershocks.

3. Methodology of the multifractal analysis

3.1. Step 1: selection of aftershocks

We follow the same method to construct stacked after-
shocks time series as in [Ouillon and Sornette, 2005]. Brieﬂy,
all earthquakes in the catalog are considered successively as
potential mainshocks. For each event, we look at the sub-
sequent seismicity within T = 1 year and within a distance
R = 2L, where L is the rupture length of the mainshock,
which is determined empirically from the magnitude using
Wells and Coppersmith [1994]’s relationship. If the rupture
length is smaller than the spatial location accuracy (which
we assume here to be 10km), we set L = 10km. If an event
has previously been tagged as an aftershock of a larger event,
then it is removed from the list of potential mainshocks. Af-
tershock series are then sorted according to the magnitude
of the main event, and stacked using a superposed epoch
procedure within given mainshock magnitude ranges. As
for the SCEC catalog, we choosed mainshock magnitude in-
tervals to vary by half-unit magnitude steps.

For the JMA catalog, we take into account the variation
of Mc(t) as follows. Individual aftershock times series were
considered in the stack only if the magnitude of the main
event, occurring at time t0, was larger than Mc(t0). If this
main event obeys that criterion, only its aftershocks above
Mc(t0) are considered in the series. This methodology al-
lowed us to use the maximum amount of data with suﬃcient
accuracy to build our staked time series of aftershock decay
rates.

3.2. Step 2: ﬁtting procedure of the stacked time
series

Once aftershocks series have been selected and stacked,
−p + B, which includes a
we ﬁt binned data with N (t) = A · t
constant background rate B. Here, N (t) is the rate of trig-
gered seismicity at time t after a mainshock that occured at
t = 0. The time axis is binned in intervals according to a ge-
ometrical series so that the width of the time intervals grows
exponentially with time. We then simply count the number
of aftershocks contained within each bin, then divide this
number by the linear size of the interval to obtain the rate
N . The ﬁtting parameters A, B, p are then obtained by a
standard grid search.

Note that, as the linear density of bins decreases as the
inverse of time, each bin receives a weight proportional to
time, balancing the weight of data points along the time axis.
In our binning, the linear size of two consecutive intervals
increases by a factor r > 1. Since the choice of r is arbitrary,
it is important to check for the robustness of the results with
respect to r. We thus performed ﬁts on time series binned
with 20 diﬀerent values of r, from r = 1.1 to r = 3 by step
of 0.1. We then checked whether the ﬁtted parameters A,
B and p were stable with r. We also computed the aver-
age values and standard deviations of all ﬁtting parameters
over the 20 r values. We excluded the early times, where
aftershock catalogs appear to be incomplete [Kagan, 2004].
Finally, a p-value determined within the magnitude interval
[M1; M2] for the mainshock was associated with magnitude

.

3.3. Step 3: Regressions in the (M, p) space and
tests of signiﬁcance

The next step consists in performing a standard linear
regression in the (M, p) plane, in order to determine the

validity of the prediction p(M ) = aM + b or, equivalently,
p(M ) = a(M − M0), with M0 = −b/a. For each catalog, we
have tested the signiﬁcance of the estimations obtained for
a, b and M0 against a series of null hypotheses deﬁned as
follows : (i) the slope a is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0;
(ii) and (iii) the slopes a and intercepts b are the same from
one catalog to another; (iv) the cutoﬀ magnitudes M0 are
the same from one catalog to another.

Such tests are usually performed through the use of F −
or t-tests. The statistical conﬁdence obtained with these
tests are reliable only if the residues (deﬁned as the dif-
ference between the observed (M, p) values and their lin-
ear regression p(M ) = aM + b) are Gaussian so that stan-
dard asymptotic theorems apply. This is doubtful for our
data and we therefore used a bootstrap method which cir-
cumvents these conditions. The bootstrap approach is per-
formed by ﬁrst considering a seismic catalog, from which
we retrieve n pairs (Mi, pi), with i = 1, ..., n. We ﬁrst per-
form a linear ﬁt on this data set and obtain the correspond-
ing a, b and M0 ﬁtted parameters, as well as the residues
′
Ri = pi − aMi − b, i = 1, ..., n. We then reshuﬄe the R
is at
random to obtain a new ordered set of residues (Mi, Ri,r).
This allows us to build a new synthetic data set (Mi, pi,r),
with pi,r = aMi + b + Ri,r. We then perform the linear re-
gression pr(M ) = arM + br = ar(M − M0,r) on the data set
constituted of the n pairs (Mi, pi,r). We perform this reshuf-
ﬂing/reﬁtting procedure 104 times. By storing the 104 val-
ues ar, br and M0,r, the cumulative probability distribution
for ar, br and M0,r is estimated, from which the conﬁdence
levels for the above hypotheses (i)-(iv) can be obtained. For
example, consider a probability level q0 < 1
2 . If an arbitrary
value a0 is smaller than the quantile q0 or larger than the
quantile 1 − q0 of the cumulative probability function of ar,
then the hypothesis that the slope a is a0 can be rejected
with a conﬁdence level larger than or equal to 1 − 2q0. For
the present analysis, we consider 95% conﬁdence levels in all
our tests, namely 2q0 = 0.05.

tio used for the binning of time intervals. Similar curves
and results are obtained for the 20 other values of r, con-
ﬁrming the robustness of the analysis. Figure 3 plots the
exponent p averaged over the 20 values r as a function
of the middle value of the corresponding magnitude inter-
val. These values and associated standard deviations are:
p(5.75) = 0.87 ± 0.05, p(6.25) = 1.00 ± 0.09, p(6.75) =
1.02 ± 0.05, p(7.25) = 1.22 ± 0.14, p(7.75) = 1.25 ± 0.09,
p(8.25) = 1.17 ± 0.29. The exponents p(M ) obtained for
the Harvard catalog are close to those obtained for the
SCEC catalog for the magnitudes which are common to the
two catalogs. The regression of p as a function of M ac-
cording to pH (M ) = aH M + bH = aH (M − M0,H ) yields
aH = 0.14 ± 0.03, bH = 0.11 ± 0.23, M0,H = −1.28 ± 2.21.
The rather large standard deviations on bH and M0,H result
from the relatively narrow magnitude range available for the
ﬁt.

For the JMA catalog, 12 magnitude intervals were used
from [2.5; 3] to [8; 8.5]). Figure 2 shows the 12 stacked after-
shocks time series and their ﬁts for r = 1.5. Figure 3 plots

the exponent p averaged over the 20 values r as a function
of the middle value of the corresponding magnitude inter-
val. These values and associated standard deviations are:
p(2.75) = 0.71 ± 0.05, p(3.25) = 0.81 ± 0.06, p(3.75) =
0.84 ± 0.03, p(4.25) = 0.74 ± 0.03, p(4.75) = 0.83 ± 0.04,
p(5.25) = 0.96 ± 0.04, p(5.75) = 0.98 ± 0.09, p(6.25) =
0.91 ± 0.05, p(6.75) = 0.96 ± 0.09, p(7.25) = 1.22 ± 0.07,
p(7.75) = 0.89 ± 0.04, p(8.25) = 1.18 ± 0.13. The values of
p are again similar to those obtained for the Harvard and
SCEC catalogs. The regression of p as a function of M
according to pJ (M ) = aJ M + bJ = aJ (M − M0,J ) yields
aJ = 0.07 ± 0.02, bJ = 0.54 ± 0.09, M0,J = −8.6 ± 3.8. Note
that the standard deviation of M0,J = −bJ /aJ is ampliﬁed
by the smallness of aJ .

The linear dependence p(M ) = aM + b predicted by the
MSA model provides a good ﬁt to all three data sets (SCEC,
Harvard and JMA catalogs). Our statistical signiﬁcance
tests using 104 bootstraps shows that all coeﬃcients aS, aH
and aJ are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0 at conﬁdence levels
very close to 100%, conﬁrming empirically the main novel
prediction of the MSA model that the Omori-Utsu p-value
is not a universal constant but increases with the magni-
tude of the mainshock magnitude. We also tested whether
the coeﬃcients aS, aH and aJ could be considered equal,
given the empirical noises and the uncertainties introduced
by the analysis. For this, we tested the six possibilies repre-
sented symbolically by (aS → aH ; aH → aS; aS → aJ ; aJ →
aS; aH → aJ ; aJ → aH) that the data for one catalog could
be explained by the coeﬃcient a of another catalog. Us-
ing again the bootstrap method to compare the value a of
one catalog with the statistical bootstrap ensemble gener-
ated with that of another catalog leads to reject ﬁve of the
six possibilities at the 95% conﬁdence level. But we can
not reject the hypothesis that the (M, p) values for the Har-
vard catalog are compatible with a slope aH equal to the
slope aS of the SCEC catalog. Similar tests performed by
the intercept coeﬃcients b yield similar results that all b’s
are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, with again one exception: for the
Harvard catalog, we could not reject the hypothesis that its
data set of (M, p) pairs may have been generated by a p(M )-
relationship with the same intercept as the one computed for
the SCEC catalog or for the JMA catalog. The tests on the
a and b coeﬃcients are not independent but similar tests for
the lower magnitude cut-oﬀ M0 nevertheless yield the same
conclusion: all M0-values are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from one
set to another at the 95% conﬁdence level for any pair of cat-
alogs, except that we could not reject the hypothesis that
the Harvard (M, p) data may have been generated by a re-
lationship p(M ) with the same M0 as the one obtained for
the SCEC catalog.

The statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences of the slopes a and
intercepts b reﬂected in the diﬀerent lower magnitude cut-
oﬀs M0 suggest diﬀerent multifractal properties of the three

catalogs associated with diﬀerent minimum triggering sizes.
Converted to rupture lengths L0 using [Wells and Copper-
smith, 1994], we obtain L0,S = 4cm ± 5cm for the SCEC
catalog, L0,H = 2mm ± 5mm for the Harvard catalog and
L0,J = 4m ± 6.5m for the JMA catalog. We conjecture
that these diﬀerent values are likely associated with diﬀer-
ent thermal and mechanical properties of the distinct world
regions.

We study temporal correlations and multifractal properties of
long river discharge records from 41 hydrological stations around the
globe. To detect long-term correlations and multifractal behaviour in
the presence of trends, we apply several recently developed methods
[detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA), wavelet analysis, and mul-
tifractal DFA] that can systematically detect and overcome nonsta-
tionarities in the data at all time scales. We ﬁnd that above some
crossover time that usually is several months, the daily runoffs are
long-term correlated, being characterized by a correlation function
C(s) that decays as C(s) ∼ s−γ . The exponent γ varies from river
to river in a wide range between 0.1 and 0.9. The power-law decay
of C(s) corresponds to a power-law increase of the corresponding
ﬂuctuation function F2(s) ∼ sH where H = 1 − γ/2 . Below
the crossover time, the daily runoffs show a very different behaviour:
They are nonstationary and characterized by H values being close to
1.5, similar to Brownian noise. We also study the multifractal proper-
ties of the records. We ﬁnd that in all records, above several months,
weak multifractality occurs. For all cases, the Renyi exponent τ (q)
for q between −10 and +10 can be ﬁtted to the remarkably simple
form τ (q) = − ln(aq + bq)/ ln 2, with solely two parameters a and
b between 0 and 1 with a + b ≥ 1. This type of multifractality is
obtained from a generalization of the binomial multifractal model.

I. INTRODUCTION

The analysis of river ﬂows has a long history. Already more
than half a century ago Hurst found by means of his R/S anal-
ysis that annual runoff records from various rivers (including
the Nile river) exhibit ”long-range statistical dependencies”
[Hurst, 1951], indicating that the ﬂuctuations in water storage
and runoff processes are self-similar over a wide range of time
scales, with no single characteristic scale. Hurst’s ﬁnding is
now recognized as the ﬁrst example for self-afﬁne fractal be-
haviour in empirical time series, see e.g. Feder [1988]. In the
1960s, the ”Hurst phenomenon” was investigated on a broader
empirical basis also for many other natural phenomena [Hurst,
Black, and Simaika, 1965, Mandelbrot and Wallis, 1969].

The scaling of the ﬂuctuations with time is reﬂected by
the scaling of the power spectrum E(f ) with frequency f ,
f −β. For stationary time series the exponent β
E(f )
is related to the decay of the corresponding autocorrelation
function C(s) of the runoffs (see Eq. (1)). For β between
s−γ, with
0 and 1, C(s) decays by a power law, C(s)
β being restricted to the interval between 0 and 1. In
γ = 1
this case, the mean correlation time diverges, and the system
is regarded as long-term correlated. For β = 0, the runoff

∼

−

data are uncorrelated on large time scales (”white noise”).
The exponents β and γ can also be determined from a ﬂuc-
tuation analysis, where the departures from the mean daily
runoffs are considered as increments of a random walk pro-
cess. If the runoffs are uncorrelated, the ﬂuctuation function
F2(s), which is equivalent to the root-mean-square displace-
ment of the random walk, increases as the square root of the
time scale s, F2(s)
√s. For long-term correlated data,
sH . The
the random walk becomes anomalous, and F2(s)
ﬂuctuation exponent H is related to the exponents β and γ via
1. For monofractal data, H is identical
β = 1
with the Hurst exponent.

γ = 2H

Recently, many studies using these methods have dealt with
scaling properties of hydrological records and the underlying
statistics, see e. g. Lovejoy and Schertzer [1991], Turcotte
and Greene [1993], Gupta, Mesa, and Dawdy [1994], Tessier
et al. [1996], Rodriguez-Iturbe and Rinaldo [1997], Pelletier
and Turcotte [1997, 1999], Pandey et al. [1998], Matsoukas,
Islam, and Rodriguez-Iturbe [2000], Menabde and Sivapalan
[2000], Montanari, Rosso, and Taqqu [2000], Peters et al.
[2002], and Livina et al. [2002].

Indeed, all the methods discussed above may fail when
trends are present in the system. Trends are systematic de-
viations from the average runoff that are caused by external
processes, e.g. the construction of a water regulation device,
the seasonal cycle, or a changing climate (global warming).
Monotonous trends may lead to an overestimation of the Hurst
exponent and thus to an underestimation of γ. It is even possi-
ble that uncorrelated data, under the inﬂuence of a trend, look
like long-term correlated ones when using the above analysis
methods. In addition, long-term correlated data cannot simply
be detrended by the common technique of moving averages,
since this method destroys the correlations on long time scales
(above the window size used). Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to
distinguish trends from long-term correlations, because sta-
tionary long-term correlated time series exhibit persistent be-
haviour and a tendency to stay close to the momentary value.
This causes positive or negative deviations from the average
value for long periods of time that might look like a trend.

In the last years, several methods, wavelet techniques (WT)
and detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA), have been devel-
oped that are able to determine long-term correlations in the
presence of trends. For details and applications of the methods
to a large number of meteorological, climatological and bio-
logical records we refer to Muzy, Bacry, and Arneodo [1991],
Peng et al. [1994], Taqqu et al. [1995], Bunde et al. [2000],
Kantelhardt et al. [2001], Hu et al. [2001], Arneodo et al.

[2002], Bunde, Kropp, and Schellnhuber [2002]. The meth-
ods, described in Section 2, consider ﬂuctuations in the cu-
mulated runoffs (often called ”proﬁle” or ”landscape” of the
record). They differ in the way the ﬂuctuations are determined
and in the type of polynomial trend that is eliminated in each
time window of size s.

In Section 2.5, we apply these detrending methods to study
the scaling of the ﬂuctuations F2(s) of river ﬂows with time
s. We focus on 23 runoff records from international river sta-
tions spread around the globe and compare the results with
those of 18 river stations from southern Germany. We ﬁnd
that all the ﬂuctuations show a pronounced crossover at inter-
mediate scales (usually several months). Below the crossover,
for small time windows s, F2(s) scales as sH with H close
to 1.5, characterizing a highly nonstationary regime similar
to Brownian noise. Well above the crossover, at large times,
the exponent H varies from river to river between 0.55 and
0.95 in a nonuniversal manner. Our ﬁnding is not consistent
with the hypothesis that the scaling is universal with an expo-
nent close to 0.75 [Hurst, Black, and Simaika, 1965, see also:
Feder, 1988] with the same power law being applicable for all
time scales from minutes till centuries [Peters et al., 2002].

The above detrending approaches, however, are not suf-
ﬁcient to fully characterize the complex dynamics of river
ﬂows, since they exclusively focus on the variance which can
be regarded as the second moment F2(s) of the full distri-
bution of the ﬂuctuations. Note that the Hurst method actu-
ally focuses on the ﬁrst moment F1(s) . To further charac-
terize a hydrological record, we extend the study to include
all moments Fq(s). A detailed description of the method,
which is a multifractal generalization of the detrended ﬂuc-
tuation analysis [Kantelhardt et al., 2002] and equivalent to
the Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) method
[Arneodo et al., 2002], is given in Section 3. Our approach
differs from the multifractal approach introduced into hydrol-
ogy by Lovejoy and Schertzer (see e.g. Lovejoy and Schertzer
[1987,1991], Lavallee et al.
[1998])
that was based on the concept of structure functions [Frisch
and Parisi, 1985] and on the assumption of the existence of
a universal cascade model. Here we perform the multifractal
analysis by studying how the different moments of the ﬂuctu-
ations Fq(s) scale with time s, see also Rodriguez-Iturbe and
Rinaldo [1997]. We ﬁnd that at large time scales, Fq(s) scales
as sh(q), and a simple functional form with two parameters (a
[ln(aq + bq)]/[q ln(2)] describes the
and b), h(q) = (1/q)
scaling exponent h(q) of all moments. On small time scales,
however, a stronger multifractality is observed that may be
partly related to the seasonal trend. The mean position of the
crossover between the two regimes is of the order of several
months and increases with q.

lated for each calendar date i, say 1st of April, by averaging
over all years in the runoff series.

φi are uncorrelated, C(s) is zero for s positive. If correlations
exist up to a certain number of days s×, the correlation func-
tion will be positive up to s× and vanish above s×. If long-
term correlations are present, s× diverges, and we observe a
power-law decay,

For large values of s, a direct calculation of C(s) is hindered
by the level of noise present in the ﬁnite hydrological records,
and by nonstationarities in the data. There are several alter-
native methods for calculating the correlation function in the
presence of long-term correlations, which we describe in the
following.

A. Power Spectrum Analysis

If the time series is stationary, we can apply standard spec-
tral analysis techniques and calculate the power spectrum
E(f ) of the time series Wi as a function of the frequency f .
For long-term correlated data, we have

E(f )

f −β,

where β is related to the correlation exponent γ by

This relation can be derived from the Wiener-Khinchin the-
orem. If, instead of the Wi the integrated runoff time series

window of size s, increase with s. We can consider the proﬁle

steps. The random walker starts at the origin and performs, in
the ith step, a jump of length φi to the right, if φi is positive,
and to the left, if φi is negative.

To ﬁnd how the square-ﬂuctuations of the proﬁle scale with
s, we ﬁrst divide each record of N elements into Ns =
int(N/s) nonoverlapping segments of size s starting from the
beginning and Ns nonoverlapping segments of size s starting
from the end of the considered runoff series. Then we deter-
mine the ﬂuctuations in each segment ν.

In the standard ﬂuctuation analysis, we obtain the ﬂuctua-
tions just from the values of the proﬁle at both endpoints of
each segment ν,

By deﬁnition, F2(s) can be viewed as root-mean-square dis-
placement of the random walker on the chain, after s steps.
For uncorrelated φi values, we obtain Fick’s diffusion law
s1/2. For the relevant case of long-term correla-
F2(s)
tions, where C(s) follows the power-law behaviour of Eq. (2),
F2(s) increases by a power law [Havlin et al., 1988],

where the ﬂuctuation exponent H is related to the correlation
exponent γ and the power-spectrum exponent β by

H = 1

γ/2 = (1 + β)/2.

(10)

−

For power-law correlations decaying faster than 1/s, we have
H = 1/2 for large s values, like for uncorrelated data.

We like to note that the standard ﬂuctuation analysis is
somewhat similar to the rescaled range analysis introduced
by Hurst (for a review see, e. g., Feder [1988]), except that
it focusses on the second moment F2(s) while Hurst con-
sidered the ﬁrst moment F1(s). For monofractal data, H is
identical to the Hurst exponent ˜H. The common disadvantage
of both methods is, that they are strongly affected by non-
stationarities in the record, such as simple polynomial trends,
which may lead to spurious results for the correlation expo-
nent. In addition, both methods cannot be used to detect ﬂuc-
tuation exponents greater than one that occur, for example,
when the data in the signal resemble the proﬁle of a random
walk.
In this case, both FA and R/S analysis yield (as an
s for any record with H
artefact of their construction) F (s)
respectively ˜H above one. We come back to this point when
describing Fig. 2.

∼

Next we describe methods that are able to determine long-
term correlations in the presence of trends and other non-
stationarities.

C. The Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)

There are different orders of DFA that are distinguished by
the way the trends in the data are eliminated. In lowest or-
der (DFA1) we determine, for each segment ν, the best lin-
ear ﬁt of the proﬁle, and identify the ﬂuctuations by the vari-
ance F 2(ν, s) of the proﬁle from this straight line. This way,
we eliminate the inﬂuence of possible linear trends on scales
larger than the segment. Note that linear trends in the proﬁle
correspond to patch-like trends in the original record. DFA1
has been proposed originally by Peng et al. [1994] when ana-
lyzing correlations in DNA. It can be generalized straightfor-
wardly to eliminate higher order trends [Bunde et al., 2000,
Kantelhardt et al., 2001, Hu et al., 2001].

In second order DFA (DFA2) one calculates the variances
F 2(ν, s) of the proﬁle from best quadratic ﬁts of the pro-
ﬁle, this way eliminating the inﬂuence of possible linear and
parabolic trends on scales larger than the segment considered.
In general, in the nthorder DFA technique, we calculate the
variances of the proﬁle from the best nth-order polynomial ﬁt,
this way eliminating the inﬂuence of possible (n
1)th-order
trends on scales larger than the segment size.

−

Explicitly, we calculate the best polynomial ﬁt yν(i) of the
proﬁle in each of the 2Ns segments ν and determine the vari-
ance

z(ν−1)s+i −

yν(i)

.

(11)

(cid:3)

Then we employ Eq. (8) to determine the mean ﬂuctuation
F2(s).

Since FA and the various stages of the DFA have different
detrending capabilities, a comparison of the ﬂuctuation func-
tions obtained by FA and DFAn can yield insight into both
long-term correlations and types of trends. This cannot be
achieved by the conventional methods, like the spectral anal-
ysis.

D. Wavelet Transform (WT)

The wavelet methods we employ here are based on the de-
termination of the mean values zν (s) of the proﬁle in each
segment ν (of length s), and the calculation of the ﬂuctu-
ations between neighbouring segments. The different order
techniques we have used in analyzing runoff ﬂuctuations dif-
fer in the way the ﬂuctuations between the average proﬁles are
treated and possible nonstationarities are eliminated.

(i) In the ﬁrst-order wavelet method (WT0), one simply de-

termines the ﬂuctuations from the ﬁrst derivative

F 2(ν, s) = [zν(s)

zν+1(s)]2.

(12)

−

WT0 corresponds to FA where constant trends in the proﬁle of
a hydrological station are eliminated, while linear trends are
not eliminated.

(ii) In the second-order wavelet method (WT1), one deter-

mines the ﬂuctuations from the second derivative

3

F 2(ν, s) = [zν(s)

2zν+1(s) + zν+2(s)]2.

(13)

−

So, if the proﬁle consists of a trend term linear in s and a ﬂuc-
tuating term, the trend term is eliminated. Regarding trend-
elimination, WT1 corresponds to DFA1.

(iii) In the third-order wavelet method (WT2), one deter-

mines the ﬂuctuations from the third derivative

F 2(ν, s) = [zν(s)

3zν+1(s) + 3zν+2(s)

zν+3(s)]2.

−

−

By deﬁnition, WT2 eliminates linear and parabolic trend
terms in the proﬁle.
In general, in WTn we determine the
ﬂuctuations from the (n + 1)th derivative, this way eliminat-
ing trends described by nth-order polynomials in the data.

Methods (i-iii) are called wavelet methods, since they can
be interpreted as transforming the proﬁle by discrete wavelets
representing ﬁrst-, second- and third-order cumulative deriva-
tives of the proﬁle. The ﬁrst-order wavelets are known in the
literature as Haar wavelets. One can also use different shapes
of the wavelets (e.g. Gaussian wavelets with width s), which
have been used by Arneodo et al. [2002] to study, for exam-
ple, long-range correlations in DNA.

We note that the ﬁrst-order wavelet method has the same
deﬁciency as the FA and R/S method: Apart from the fact
that trends are not eliminated, records described by H greater
than one cannot be analysed properly, since for all H > 1
the WT0 yields spuriously H = 1. Since the various stages
of the wavelet methods WT0, WT1, WT2, etc. have differ-
ent detrending capabilities, a comparison of their ﬂuctuation
functions can yield insight into both long-term correlations
and types of trends.

At the end of this section, before describing the results of
the FA, DFA, and WT analysis, we note that for very large s
values, s > N/4 for FA and DFA and s > N/10 for WT,
the ﬂuctuation function becomes inaccurate due to statistical
errors. Hence, we concentrate on s values lower than smax =
N/4 for FA and DFA and smax = N/10 for WT.

E. Results

In our study we analyzed 41 runoff records, 18 of them
are from the southern part of Germany, and the rest is from
North- and South America, Africa, Australia, Asia and Eu-
rope (see Tables 1 and 2). We begin the analysis with the
runoff record for the river Weser in the northern part of Ger-
many, which is the longest record (171 years) in this study.
Qualitatively, persistence can be seen already in plots of the
departures φi = Wi −
W i from the mean daily runoffs W i, as
shown in Fig. 1(a) for two successive years from the middle of
the record. The persistence is represented by relatively large
patches of positive and negative values of φi. Indeed, when
the data are randomly shufﬂed and again two successive years
from the middle of the shufﬂed record are plotted, the large
patches disappear, as seen in Fig. 1(d).

Figures 1(b) and (e) show the corresponding proﬁles, as de-
ﬁned in Eq. (6), for the whole duration of the record. The per-
sistence of the data leads to strong ﬂuctuations in Fig. 1(b). In
contrast, the proﬁle becomes much smoother when the persis-
tence is removed by randomly shufﬂing the data [Fig. 1(d)].

are approximately straight lines for s above 30 days, with a
slope H
0.75. This result for the Weser suggests, that there
exists long-term persistence expressed by the power-law de-
cay of the correlation function, with an exponent γ
0.5 [see
Eq. (9)].

To show that the slope H

0.75 is due to long-term
correlations and not due to a broad probability distribution
(Joseph- versus Noah-Phenomenon, see Mandelbrot and Wal-
lis [1968]), we have eliminated the correlations by randomly
shufﬂing the φi. This shufﬂing has no effect on the probabil-
ity distribution function of the φi. Figures 1(d)-(f) show the
effect of shufﬂing on (d) the daily runoff ﬂuctuations φi, (e)
the proﬁle, and (f) the ﬂuctuation functions. By comparing
Figs. 1(a)-(c) with 1(d)-(f), we see the effect of correlations:
The uncorrelated φi are less patchy, the uncorrelated proﬁle
shows much smaller ﬂuctuations, and the exponent H charac-

imate straight lines, with slopes H depending on the speciﬁc river,

of the crossover to straight line scaling behaviour can be determined
best using the DFA1 and WT1-4 curves, since it is systematically
moved to larger scales for DFA2-DFA4. Thus, the crossover occurs
at s× ≈ 30 − 100 days.

Figure 2 shows the ﬂuctuation functions of 4 more rivers,
from Europe, North America, Africa and South America. The
panels on the left side show the FA and DFA1-4 curves, while
the panels on the right show the results from the analogous
wavelet analysis WT0-WT4. All curves show a remarkable
crossover between 30 and 100 days, which can be estimated
best from the DFA1 and WT1-4 curves. A similar crossover
has been reported by Tessier et al. [1996] for small French
rivers without artiﬁcial dams or reservoirs. Below and above
the crossover time s×, the ﬂuctuation functions (from DFA1-
4 and WT1-4) show power-law behaviour, with exponents
0.85 for
slightly above 1.5 below s× and exponents H

Accordingly, there is no universal scaling behaviour since
the long-term exponents vary strongly from river to river.
This ﬁnding is consistent with the observation that small and
large basins exhibit a quite different scaling behaviour [Gupta,
Mesa, and Dawdy, 1994].
In addition, there exist differ-
ent mechanisms for ﬂoods where each may induce different
scaling. For example, rain induced ﬂoods and snow induced
ﬂoods may introduce different scaling [Gupta and Dawdy,
1995].

This nonuniversal feature found in rivers should be com-
pared with climate records, where universal long-term persis-
tence of temperature records at land stations were observed
[Koscielny-Bunde et al., 1996, 1998, Pelletier and Turcotte,
1997, Pelletier, 1997, Pelletier and Turcotte, 1999, Talkner
and Weber, 2000]. Recently these results have been applied to
evaluate the performance of global climate models [Govindan
et al., 2002]. In contrast to the temperature records, the hy-
drological records are usually characterized by two different
scaling regimes separated by a crossover time s× that in Fig.
2 varies between 30 and 100 days. Below s×, in the short time
regime, the data are non-stationary, being characterized by a
scaling exponent above 1.5. Above s×, the data are long-term
power-law correlated with exponents between 0.55 and 0.95
(see also the histogram in Fig. 4).

Figure 2 shows clearly the deﬁciencies of the FA and WT0
method discussed above that is also shared by Hursts R/S-
method. Below the crossover times, the FA and WT0 curves
are straight lines in the log-log plot with slope 1, yielding the
spurious result H = 1 for ﬂuctuations that are actually de-
scribed by H ∼= 1.5 at small times s. We like to note that
for detecting nonstationary behaviour (H > 1) within FA,
WT0 and R/S analysis, one has to study the increment series
φi of the original series φi. In this case, φi is
∆φi = φi+1 −
the proﬁle of the increment series ∆φi. When analyzing the
increment series, H will be decreased by one: If the φi have a
ﬂuctuation exponent H close to 1.5, the ﬂuctuation exponent
of the ∆φi is close to 0.5. Indeed, when analyzing the ∆φi
record using FA and WT0, we obtained an exponent close to
0.5 below the crossover.

When looking at the position of the crossover, one notices
also a (minor) deﬁciency of the DFA methods: With increas-
ing order of DFA, the crossover shifts towards larger values of
s [Kantelhardt et al., 2001, Hu et al., 2001]. For best estimate
of the real crossover, it is better to choose the various wavelet

methods WT1-4, where the position of the crossover is almost
unchanged.

Figure 3 shows the ﬂuctuation functions for two rivers that
are different from the others, (a) for a river that is rather dry
in the summer (Mary River, Australia) and (b) a river (Gaula
River, Norway) that is frozen in the winter. For the Mary river,
the crossover time s× is only about 5 days and the long-term
exponent H
0.60 is well below the average value. For the
Gaula river, the crossover time is about 30 days. The long-
term correlations are not pronounced (H = 0.55) and even
hard to distinguish from the uncorrelated case H = 0.5. We
obtained similar results for the other two ”frozen” rivers (Tana
from Norway and Dvina from Russia) that we analysed. For
interpreting this distinguished behaviour of the frozen rivers
we like to note that on permafrost ground the lateral inﬂow
(and hence the indirect contribution of the water storage in
the catchment basin) contributes to the runoffs in a different
way than on normal ground. Our results suggest that the con-
tribution of snow melting leads to less correlated runoffs than
the contribution of rainfall.

rivers that are either rather dry in the summer (Mary River, Aus-
tralia (a,c)) or frozen in the winter (Gaula River, Norway, (b,d)).
The long-term correlations are not pronounced (H = 0.60 and
H = 0.55, respectively) and the crossover times s× are rather small
(5 days and 30 days, respectively).

Figure 4 and Table 3 summarize our results for the long-
term exponents H we obtained for the international rivers (I1-
I23) and the rivers from South Germany (B1-B18). As can
be seen in the ﬁgure, the exponents spread from 0.55 to 0.95
covering the whole range from very weak to very strong cor-
relations. Since the correlation exponent γ is related to H by
2H, the exponent γ spreads from almost 0 to almost
γ = 2
1, covering the whole range of long-term correlations. Note
that the rivers within a localized area (as South Germany) tend
to have nearly the same range of exponents as the international
rivers. The three ”frozen” rivers in our study have the lowest
values of H.

III. MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS

A. Method

For a further characterization of hydrological records it is
meaningful to extend Eq. (8) by considering the more general
ﬂuctuation functions [Barabasi and Vicsek, 1991],

Thus, h(q) deﬁned in Eq. (18) is directly related to the classi-
cal multifractal scaling exponents τ (q).

In general, the exponent h(q) may depend on q. Since for
stationary records, h(1) is identical to the well-known Hurst
exponent ˜H (see e. g. Feder [1988]), we will call the function
h(q) generalized Hurst exponent. For monofractal self-afﬁne
time series, h(q) is independent of q, since the scaling be-
haviour of the variances F 2(ν, s) is identical for all segments
ν, and the averaging procedure in Eq. (15) will give just this
identical scaling behaviour for all values of q. Only if small
and large ﬂuctuations scale differently, there will be a signiﬁ-
cant dependence of h(q) on q: If we consider positive values
of q, the segments ν with large variance F 2(ν, s) (i. e. large
deviations from the corresponding ﬁt) will dominate the av-
erage Fq(s). Thus, for positive values of q, h(q) describes
the scaling behaviour of the segments with large ﬂuctuations.
Usually the large ﬂuctuations are characterized by a smaller
scaling exponent h(q) for multifractal series. On the contrary,
for negative values of q, the segments ν with small variance
F 2(ν, s) will dominate the average Fq(s). Hence, for negative
values of q, h(q) describes the scaling behaviour of the seg-
ments with small ﬂuctuations, which are usually characterized
by a larger scaling exponent.

In the hydrological literature (see, e. g., Rodriguez-Iturbe
and Rinaldo [1997] and Lavallee et al. [1993]) one often con-
siders the generalized mass variogram Cq(λ),

Fq(s) =

Comparing Eqs. (15), (18), and (20) one can verify easily that
K(q) and h(q) are related by

q

where the variable q can take any real value except zero. For
q = 2, the standard ﬂuctuation analysis, Eqs. (7) and (8), is
retrieved. The question is, how the ﬂuctuation functions de-
pend on q and how this dependence is related to multifractal
features of the record.

In general, the multifractal approach is introduced by the

partition function

where τ (q) is the Renyi scaling exponent. A record is called
’monofractal’, when τ (q) depends linearly on q; otherwise it
is called multifractal.

It is easy to verify that Zq(s) is related to Fq(s) by

Fq(s) =

(cid:27)

Accordingly, Eq. (16) implies

where

∼

h(q) = [τ (q) + 1]/q.

(17)

(18)

(19)

h(q) = K(q)/q.

(21)

Another way to characterize a multifractal series is the sin-
gularity spectrum f (α), that is related to τ (q) via a Legen-
dre transform (see, e.g., Feder [1988], Peitgen, J¨urgens, and
Saupe [1992], Rodriguez-Iturbe and Rinaldo [1997]),

α =

dτ (q)
dq

and f (α) = qα

τ (q).

(22)

−

Here, α is the singularity strength or H¨older exponent, while
f (α) denotes the dimension of the subset of the series that is
characterized by α. Using Eq. (19), we can directly relate α
and f (α) to h(q),

α = h(q) + q

and f (α) = q[α

h(q)] + 1. (23)

The multifractal analysis described above is a straightfor-
ward generalization of the ﬂuctuation analysis and therefore
has the same problems: (i) Monotonous trends in the record
may lead to spurious results for the ﬂuctuation exponent h(q)

∞

h(

∼

which in turn leads to spurious results for the correlation ex-
ponent γ. (ii) Nonstationary behaviour characterized by expo-
nents h(q) > 1 cannot be detected by the simple method since
the method cannot distinguish between exponents > 1 and al-
ways will yield F2(s)
s in this case (see above). To over-
come these drawbacks the multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (MF-DFA) has been introduced recently [Kantelhardt
et al., 2002, see also Koscielny-Bunde et al., 1998, Weber and
Talkner, 2001]. According to [Kantelhardt et al., 2002], the
method is as accurate as the wavelet methods. Thus, we have
used MF-DFA for the multifractal analysis here. In the MF-
DFA, one starts with the DFA-ﬂuctuations F 2
ν (s) as obtained
in Eq. (11). Then, we deﬁne in close analogy to Eqs. (8) and
(15) the generalized ﬂuctuation function,

Again, we can distinguish MF-DFA1, MF-DFA2, etc. accord-
ing to the order of the polynomial ﬁts involved.

ﬂuctuation function Fq(s). We have also cross checked the
results by using the Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima
(WTMM) method [Muzy, Bacry, and Arneodo, 1991, Ar-
neodo, 2002], and always ﬁnd agreement within the error bars.
Therefore, we present here only the results of MF-DFA4. Fig-
ure 5(a,b) shows two representative examples for the ﬂuc-
tuation functions Fq(s), for (a) the Weser river and (b) the
Danube river. The standard ﬂuctuation function F2(s) is plot-
ted in full symbols. The crossover in F2(s) that was discussed
in Sect. II E can be also seen in the other moments Fq(s).
The position of the crossover increases monotonously with
decreasing q and the crossover becomes more pronounced.
The DFA4 curves shown here slightly overestimate the po-
sition of the crossover, as mentioned before. We are inter-
ested in the asymptotic behaviour of Fq(s) at large times s.
One can see clearly that above the crossover, the Fq(s) func-
tions are straight lines in the double logarithmic plot, and the
slopes increase slightly when going from high positive mo-
ments towards high negative moments (from the bottom to
the top). For the Weser, for example, the slope changes from
0.65 for q = 10 to 0.9 for q =
10 (see also Fig. 7(b)). The
monotonous increase of the slopes, h(q), is the signature of
multifractality.

nature of weak multifractality. (c,d) The analog curves to (a,b), re-

When the data are shufﬂed (see Figs. 5(c,d)), all functions

Fq(s) increase asymptomatically as Fq(s)
dicates that the multifractality vanishes under shufﬂing. Ac-
cordingly the observed multifractality originates in the long-
term correlations of the record and is not caused by singular-
ities in the distribution of the daily runoffs (see also Mandel-
brot and Wallis [1968]). A reshufﬂing-resistent multifractality
would indicate a ’statistical’ type of non-linearity [Sivapalan,
Jothityangkoon, and Menabde, 2002]). We obtain similar pat-
terns for all rivers. Figure 6 shows four more examples; Figs.

Fq(s) on large time scales. The error bars of the ﬁts correspond
to the size of the symbols. The lines are obtained by ﬁts of the
two-parameter binomial model that is described in Sect. III C. The
resulting model parameters a and b are reported in the Figures. All
ﬁts are consistent with the data within the error bars.

From the asymptotic slopes of the curves in Figs. 5(a,b)
and 6(a-d), we obtain the generalized Hurst-exponents h(q),
which are plotted in Fig. 7 (circles). The line is obtained by
a modiﬁcation of the two-parameter binomial model that is
described in Sect. III C. The model yields

We have ﬁtted the h(q) spectra in the range

for all 41 runoff series with Eq. (25), see Fig. 7. The results
for the two parameters a and b (together with H = h(2) and
∆α (see below)) are shown in Table 3. In each single case,
the q dependence of h(q) for positive and negative values of
q can be characterized well by the two parameters, and all ﬁts
remain within the error bars of the h(q) values.

From h(q) we obtain τ (q) (Eq. (19)) and the singularity
spectrum f (α) (Eq. (23)). Figure 8 shows two typical exam-
ples for the Danube and the Niger. The width of f (α) taken at
f = 0 characterizes the strength of the multifractality. Since
both widths are very different, the strength of the multifractal-
ity of river runoffs is not universal.

(25)

(26)

In order to characterize and to compare the strength of the
multifractality for several time series we use as parameter the
width of the singularity spectrum f (α) [see Eqs. (22) and
(23)] at f = 0, which corresponds to the difference of the
maximum and the minimum value of α. In the binomial mul-

The distribution of the ∆α values we obtained from Eq. (27)
is shown in the histogram in Fig. 9. The histogram shows
that there are rivers with quite strong multifractal ﬂuctuations,
i.e. large ∆α, and one with almost vanishing multifractality,
i.e. ∆α
0. The distribution of the multifractality strengths
within the local area of southern Germany (grey boxes in Fig.
9) is also quite broad, but deﬁnitely not as broad as for the
international runoff records from all rivers around the globe.

with the three parameters H ′, C1, and α′, that has been used
by Lovejoy, Schertzer, and coworkers [Schertzer and Love-
joy, 1987; Lovejoy and Schertzer, 1991, Lavallee et al., 1993,
Tessier et al., 1996, Pandey et al., 1998] successfully to de-
scribe the multifractal behaviour of rainfall and runoff records.
The deﬁnition of K(q) we used in this paper is taken from
Rodriguez-Iturbe and Rinaldo [1997] and differs slightly from

10

their deﬁnition. We like to note that Eq. (26) for K(q) is not
only valid for positive q values, but also for negative q values.
This feature allows us to determine numerically the full singu-
larity spectrum f (α). In the analysis we focused on long time
scales, excluding the crossover regime, and used detrending
methods. We consider it as particularly interesting that only
two parameters a and b or, equivalently, H and ∆α, are sufﬁ-
cient to describe τ (q) and K(q) for positive as well as negative
q values. This strongly supports the idea of ’universal’ multi-
fractal behaviour of river runoffs as suggested by Lovejoy and
Schertzer.

C. Extended Binomial Cascade Model

In order to characterize the multifractal spectra with a min-
imum number of parameters, we consider the binomial mul-
tifractal model, see e.g. Feder [1988], Barabasi and Vicsek
[1991], Peitgen et al. [1992], and Kantelhardt et al. [2002].
The model is based on a multiplicative cascade process. In
this process, a record φk of length N = 2nmax is constructed
recursively:

In generation n = 0, the record elements are constant,
φk = 1 for all k = 1, . . . , N . In the ﬁrst step of the cas-
cade (generation n = 1) the ﬁrst half of the series is multi-
plied by a factor a and the second half of the series is multi-
plied by a factor b. This yields φk = a for k = 1, . . . , N/2
and φk = b for k = N/2 + 1, . . . , N . The parameters a
and b are between zero and one, 0 < a < b < 1. Note
that we do not restrict the model to b = 1
a as is of-
ten done in the literature [Feder, 1988, Peitgen et al., 1992].
In the second step (generation n = 2), we apply the pro-
cess of step 1 to the two subseries, yielding φk = a2 for
k = 1, . . . , N/4, φk = ab for k = N/4 + 1, . . . , N/2,
φk = ba = ab for k = N/2 + 1, . . . , 3N/4, and φk = b2
for k = 3N/4 + 1, . . . , N . In general, in step n + 1, each sub-
series of step n is divided into two subseries of equal length,
and the ﬁrst half of the φk is multiplied by a while the second
half is multiplied by b. For example, in generation n = 3 the
values in the eight subseries are

−

a3, a2b, a2b, ab2, a2b, ab2, ab2, b3.

(29)

After nmax steps, the ﬁnal generation has been reached, where
all subseries have length 1 and no more splitting is possible.
We note that the ﬁnal record can be written as

φk = anmax−n(k−1)bn(k−1),

(30)

where n(k) is the number of digits 1 in the binary representa-
tion of the index k, e. g. n(13) = 3, since 13 corresponds to
binary 1101.

For this binomial multifractal model, the formula for τ (q)
has been derived earlier, see e.g. Feder [1988], Barabasi and
Vicsek [1991], Peitgen et al. [1992], and Kantelhardt et al.
[2002]. For convenience, we sketch the derivation in the ap-
pendix. The result is

τ (q) = −

h(q) =

ln(aq + bq) + q ln(a + b)
ln 2
ln(aq + bq)
q ln 2

ln(a + b)
ln 2

+

,

1
q −

.

It is easy to see that h(1) = 1 for all values of a and b. Thus,
in this form the model is limited to cases where h(1), which
is the exponent Hurst deﬁned originally in the R/S method,
is equal to one. In order to generalize this multifractal cas-
cade process such that any value of h(1) is possible, we have
subtracted the offset ∆h = ln(a + b)/ ln(2) from h(q). The
constant offset ∆h corresponds to additional long-term cor-
relations incorporated in the binomial model. For generat-
ing records without this offset, we rescale the power spec-
trum. First we Fast-Fourier transform (FFT) the simple bi-
nomial multifractal record (30) into the frequency domain.
Then we multiply all Fourier coefﬁcients by f −∆h, where f
is the frequency. This way, the slope β of the power spectra
f −β (the squares of the Fourier coefﬁcients) is de-
E(f )
∼
ln(a2 +b2)]/ ln 2
creased from β = 2h(2)
1 = [2 ln(a+b)
into β′ = 2[h(2)
ln(a2 + b2)/ ln 2, which is
1 =
∆h]
consistent with Eq. (25). Finally, backward FFT is employed
to transform the signal back into the time domain. A simi-
lar Fourier ﬁltering technique has been used by Tessier et al.
[1996] when generating surrogate runoff data.

D. Comparison with Model Data

In order to see how well the extended binomial cascade
model ﬁts to the real data (for a given river), we generate the
model data as follows: (i) we determine a and b for the given
river (by best ﬁt of Eq. (25)), (ii) we generate the simple bino-
mial multifractal model with the obtained a and b values. (iii)
We implement the proper long-term correlations as described
above.

Figure 10(a) shows the DFA analysis of the model data with
parameters a and b determined for the river Weser. By com-
paring with Fig. 5(a) we see that the extended model gives
the correct scaling of the ﬂuctuation functions Fq(s) on time
scales above the crossover. By comparing Fig. 10(b) with
Fig. 5(c) we see that the shufﬂed model series becomes un-
correlated without multifractality like for the shufﬂed data.
Below the crossover, however, the model does not yield the
observed Fq(s) in the original data.
In the following we
show that in order to obtain the proper behaviour below the
crossover, either seasonal trends that cannot be completely
eliminated from the data or a different type of multifractal-
ity below the crossover, represented by different values of a
and b, have to be introduced.

To show the effect of seasonal trends, we have multi-
plied the elements φi of the extended cascade model by
0.1 + sin2(πi/365). Figure 10(c) shows the DFA4 result
for the generalized ﬂuctuation functions, which now better
resembles the real data than Fig. 10(a). Finally, in Fig.
10(d) we show the effect of a different multifractality below
the crossover, where different parameters a and b character-
ize this regime. The results also show better agreement with

11

(31)

(32)

the real data. When comparing Figs. 10(a,c,d) with Figs. 5
and 6, it seems that Danube, Amper and Wertach ﬁt better to
Fig. 10(d), i.e. suggesting different multifractality for short
and large time scales, while Weser, Susquehanna and Niger ﬁt
better to Fig. 10(c) where seasonal trends are responsible for
the behaviour below the crossover.

Weser. The ﬂuctuation function Fq(s) for (a) the original φi series
and (b) the shufﬂed series are plotted versus scalce s for the same
values of q as in the other ﬁgures. In (c) the φi have been multiplied
by 0.1 + sin2(πi/365) before the analysis to simulate a seasonal
trend. In (d) modiﬁed values of the parameters a and b (a = 0.26,
b = 0.59) have been used on scales s ≤ 256 to simulate the apparent
stronger multifractality on smaller scales observed for most rivers.
The straight lines in the ﬁgures have slopes h = 0.75 in (a,c,d) and
h = 0.5 in (b) and are shown for comparison. For the ﬁgure, results
from 10 surrogate series of length 140 years were averaged.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this study, we analyzed the scaling behaviour of daily
runoff time series of 18 representative rivers in southern Ger-
many and 23 international rivers using both, the Detrended
Fluctuation Analyses (DFA) method and wavelet techniques.
In all cases we found that the ﬂuctuations exhibit self-afﬁne
scaling behaviour and long-term persistence on time scales
ranging from months to decades. The ﬂuctuation exponent H
varies from river to river in a wide range between 0.55 and
0.95, showing non-universal scaling behaviour. On short time
scales (below 30-100 days) the daily runoffs show a very dif-
ferent behaviour: They are nonstationary and characterized by
H values being close to 1.5, similar to Brownian noise.

We also studied the multifractal properties of the runoff
time series using a multifractal generalization of the DFA
method that was crosschecked with the WTMM technique.
We found that the multifractal spectra of all 41 records can
be consistently described by a ’universal’ function τ (q) =
ln(aq + bq)/ ln 2, which can be obtained from a general-
−
ization of the binomial multifractal model and has solely two

2 −

ln(a2 + b2)/ ln 4 and the width ∆α = ln a

parameters a and b or, equivalently, the ﬂuctuation exponent
H = 1
b / ln 2
of the singularity spectrum. Since our function for τ (q) ap-
plies also for negative q values, we could derive the singularity
spectra f (α) from the ﬁts. We have calculated and listed the
values of H, a, b, and ∆α for all records considered. There
are no signiﬁcant differences between their distributions for
rivers in South Germany and for international rivers. We sug-
gest that the values of H and ∆α can be regarded as ’ﬁnger-
prints’ for each station or river, which can serve as an efﬁcient
non-trivial test bed for the state-of-the-art precipitation-runoff
models. Furthermore, the generalization of the binomial mul-
tifractal model we described allows to generate and test mul-
tifractal surrogate data with speciﬁc properties for each river.
We believe that such surrogate data is practically relevant for
an improved ﬂood statistics.

≈

We have also investigated the origin of the multifractal scal-
ing behaviour by comparison with the corresponding shufﬂed
data. We found that the multifractality is removed by shufﬂing
that destroys the time correlations in the series while the dis-
tribution of the runoff values is not altered. After shufﬂing, we
obtain h(q)
1/2 for all values of q, indicating monofractal
behaviour. Hence, our results suggest that the multifractality
is not due to the existence of a broad, asymmetric (singular)
probability density distribution [Anderson and Meerschaert,
1998], but due to a speciﬁc dynamical arrangement of the val-
ues in the time series, i.e. a self-similar ’clustering’ of time
patterns of values on different time scales. We believe that
our results will be useful also to improve the understanding of
extreme values (singularities) in the presence of multifractal
long-term correlations and trends.

V. APPENDIX: BINOMIAL MULTIFRACTAL MODEL

The binomial multifractal model series of N = 2nmax num-

bers φk with k = 1, . . . , N is deﬁned by Eq. (30),

φk = anmax−n(k−1)bn(k−1),

where 0 < a < b < 1 are two parameters and n(k) is the
number of digits equal to 1 in the binary representation of the
index k, e. g. n(13) = 3, since 13 corresponds to binary 1101.
The scaling exponents τ (q) can be calculated straightfor-
z(ν−1)2s in the

wardly. The box probability p2s(ν) = zν2s −
νth segment of size 2s is given by

p2s(ν) = ps(2ν

1) + ps(2ν)
= [a/b + 1]ps(2ν) = ps(2ν)(a + b)/b.

Thus, according to Eqs. (16) and (30),

Zq(s) =

[ps(ν)]q =

[ps(2ν

1)]q + [ps(2ν)]q

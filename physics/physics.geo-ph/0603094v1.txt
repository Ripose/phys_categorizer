Landslide inventories show that the statistical distribu-
tion of the area of recorded events is well described by a
power law over a range of decades. To understand these
distributions, we consider a cellular automaton to model a
time and position dependent factor of safety. The model is
able to reproduce the complex structure of landslide distri-
bution, as experimentally reported. In particular, we inves-
tigate the role of the rate of change of the system dynamical
variables, induced by an external drive, on landslide mod-
eling and its implications on hazard assessment. As the
rate is increased, the model has a crossover from a critical
regime with power-laws to non power-law behaviors. We
suggest that the detection of patterns of correlated domains
in monitored regions can be crucial to identify the response
of the system to perturbations, i.e., for hazard assessment.

Introduction As for earthquakes and forest ﬁres, there
is a compelling evidence that the landslide frequency-size
distributions are power-law functions of the area [Turcotte
et al., 2002]. The presence of these broad distributions has
crucial consequences on both the basic understanding of
these phenomena and the practical and relevant purposes,
such as the evaluation of natural hazards. Here, we intro-
duce a cellular automaton that is aimed at modeling the
general features of landslides, and is focused on the dynam-
ical evolution of a space and time dependent factor of safety
ﬁeld. This model is very simple, but it is able to give a
comprehensive picture of the avalanching phenomena and
to reproduce some well-known properties of landslide distri-
butions.

Several authors invoked the paradigm of self-organized
criticality (SOC) [Bak et al., 1987; Jensen, 1998; Turcotte,
1999] to explain landslide distributions [Turcotte et al., 2002;
Pelletier et al., 1997; Hertgarten and Neugebauer , 2000]. Al-
though the “critical” nature of the present phenomenon is
not yet assessed and many authors believe that deviations
from power-law appear to be systematic for small
land-
slides data [Stark and Hovius, 2001; Pelletier et al., 1997;
Brardinoni and Church, 2004; Malamud et al., 2004], several
regional landslide inventories records show robust power-
law distributions of large events with an exponent around
α ∼ 2.5 [Turcotte et al., 2002], ranging approximately from
α ∼ 1.75 for rockfalls to α ∼ 2.8 for mixed landslides (see
[Dussauge et al., 2003; Faillettaz et al., 2004] and refer-
ences therein). The universality of such an exponent is still
debated (see [Turcotte et al., 2002; Dussauge et al., 2003;
Faillettaz et al., 2004; Malamud et al., 2004] and references
above), and its reported values are far from the one in the
original “sandpile model” [Bak et al., 1987], where α ∼ 1.0.
Recently, the reported values of α have been obtained by
introducing two-thresholds mechanisms in models that re-
late landslide dynamics both to SOC [Pelletier et al., 1997;

Hertgarten and Neugebauer , 2000] and to non SOC cellu-
lar automata [Faillettaz et al., 2004]. Furthermore, models
based on Γ [Malamud et al., 2004] or Pareto [Stark and Hov-
ius, 2001] distributions have been proposed.

Here, we consider a model inspired to an anisotropic ver-
sion of the Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) [Olami et al.,
1992] cellular automaton and subject to a ﬁnite driving rate
[Hamon et al., 2002]. The model describes the evolution of
a space and time dependent factor of safety, which is in-
vestigated for the ﬁrst time in the present framework.
In
particular, we outline the essential role played by the rate
of change of the system dynamical variables (variation of
pore water pressure, lithostatic stress, cohesion coeﬃcients,
etc., [Helley et al., 2004; Iverson et al., 2000]) induced by
external triggers. We ﬁnd the model to be at the edge of
the SOC limit. Actually, such a limit, which is achieved
only in the asymptotic condition of vanishing driving rate,
is hardly attainable in a real landslide process. The model
is able to reproduce power-law distributions with exponents
very close to the observed values. Power-laws are robust
even though their exponent smoothly depends on system
parameters (e.g., time derivative of the factor of safety and
its dissipation level, see below). In this sense, although the
SOC paradigm to some extent may be applied to landslides
[Turcotte et al., 2002], the idea of universality, within this
model, must be restricted to the shape of the frequency-size
distribution rather than to its exponent, as can be deduced
from some catalogues [Dussauge et al., 2003; Faillettaz et al.,
2004]. Finally, in presence of strong driving rates we ﬁnd
that the model has Gaussian behaviors. We examine below
the implications of our results on hazard assessment.

The Model The empirical Mohr-Coulomb failure crite-
rion establishes that landslides occur when the shear stress
exceeds a maximum value, which is given by τmax = c +
(σ − u) tan φ, with σ the total normal stress, u the pore-
ﬂuid pressure, φ the angle of internal friction of the soil
and c the cohesional (non-frictional) component of the soil
strength [Terzaghi, 1962]. In literature, the factor of safety,
F S, against slip is deﬁned by the ratio of the maximum
shear strength τmax to the disturbing shear stress τ

F S =

τmax
τ

.

If F S > 1 resisting forces exceed driving forces and the slope
remains stable. Slope failure starts when F S = 1. Although
the practical determination of F S is diﬃcult, simple one-
dimensional inﬁnite-slope models can quantify how c, u and
φ inﬂuence the Coulomb failure and show that the ground-
water term has the most widely ranging inﬂuence [Iverson
et al., 1997]. Traditional models generally treat soils and
rocks as continuous porous media that obey to the Darcy’s
law. Actually, ﬁeld evidence indicates that the hydrology
of some natural slopes is strongly inﬂuenced by discontinu-
ities such as fractures and macropores. In practice, obser-
vations of large spatial and temporal ﬂuctuations of water
ﬂow, within slopes at diﬀerent sites, support the assertion
that water-ﬂow paths and permeability continually change

In order

to take into account

within the slopes and also during the failure, providing dif-
ferent local values of the pore pressures and of the cohesion
[Iverson et al., 1997; Helley et al., 2004; Iverson et al., 2000].
the complex non-
homogeneous structure of a slope in the above failure condi-
tion, we consider a site and time dependent factor of safety,
F S. In particular, we approximate a natural slope by a two-
dimensional (square) grid and deﬁne on each cell, i, of the
lattice a local variable ei = 1/F Si. Such a local inverse fac-
tor of safety is the fundamental dynamical variable of our
model. The presence of diﬀusion, dissipative and driving
mechanisms acting in the soil, such as those on the water
content, inspires the dynamics of our model, which is de-
ﬁned by the following operations. Starting from a random
and “stable” initial conﬁguration (ei < 1 ∀i), the system is
subject to changes caused by some external trigger, as for
instance a uniform rainfall, and the values of ei on each cell
of our grid change at a given rate ν, ei → ei + ν. For the
sake of simplicity, we consider here only a uniform driving
rate, ν, but diﬀerent choices can be made to simulate the
eﬀect of diﬀerent hydrologic and external triggering mecha-
nisms. The model is driven as long as ei < 1 on all sites i.
Then, when the generic site i becomes unstable (i.e., over-
passes the threshold, ei ≥ 1), it relaxes with its neighbors
according to the rule:

ei → 0;

enn → enn + fnnei,

where the index nn denotes the nearest neighbors of site i
and fnn is the fraction of ei toppling on nn (after failure
we set 1/F S = 0 for simplicity, as any other ﬁnite level
would work [Jensen, 1998]). This kind of chain relaxations
(“avalanches”) is considered to be instantaneous compared
to the time scale of the overall drive and it lasts until all sites
are below threshold. The model is said to be conservative
if C = Pnn fnn = 1. Since many complex dissipative phe-
nomena (such as evaporation mechanism, volume contrac-
[Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993]) contribute to a
tions, etc.
dissipative stress transfer, we consider the non-conservative
case C < 1, which is diﬀerent from previous landslide mod-
els [Pelletier et al., 1997; Hertgarten and Neugebauer , 2000].
Since gravity individuates a privileged direction, we consider
an anisotropic model where the fraction of ei moving from
the site i to its “downward” (resp. “upward”) neighbor on
the square lattice is fd (resp. fu), as fl = fr is the fraction
to each of its “left” and “right” neighbors. In particular, we
assume fu < fd and fl = fr < fd. This choice of parameters
is made in the attempt to sketch the complex relaxation pro-
cesses occurring in a slope failure. The conservation level,
C, and the anisotropy factors, f ’s, which we assume to be
uniform, are actually related to the local soil properties (e.g.,
lithostatic, frictional and cohesional properties), as well as
to the local geometry of the slope (e.g., its morphology).
The rate of change of the inverse factor of safety, ν, which is
induced by the external drive (e.g., rainfall) and is related
to soil and slope properties, quantiﬁes how the triggering
mechanisms aﬀect the time derivative of the FS ﬁeld.

Numerical Results We consider a 64 × 64 square lat-
tice, implementing both cylindrical (open along the verti-
cal axis and periodical along the horizontal axis) and open
boundary conditions, which do not give appreciable diﬀer-
ences. Once the system has attained a stationary state in
its dynamics, we study the probability distribution, P (s), of
avalanches of size s. During a run (we treat statistics of over
109 events per run) the conservation level C and the rate, ν,
are kept ﬁxed. Examples of the frequency-size distribution
of avalanches, P (s), are shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2. In ﬁgure
1, the diﬀerent curves correspond to diﬀerent values of the
rate ν, for C = 0.4, and in ﬁgure 2 to diﬀerent values of C,
for ν = 5 · 10−3.

In the limit of very small driving rate, i.e., ν → 0, the
distribution of events, P (s), exhibits the typical SOC struc-
ture (see ﬁgure 1): a power law characterized by a critical

is found, while for small events (s < s

exponent α, P (s) ∼ s
, in agreement with the experi-
mental evidence on medium and large landslides [Turcotte
et al., 2002; Pelletier et al., 1997; Hertgarten and Neuge-
bauer , 2000; Faillettaz et al., 2004; Brardinoni and Church,
2004; Malamud et al., 2004; Dussauge et al., 2003], followed
by a size dependent exponential cutoﬀ [Jensen, 1998]. By
increasing the rate ν, the power-law regime shifts towards
larger sizes and at some point the probability distribution

) the above struc-
two regimes: for large landslides (s > s

ture P (s) ∼ s
)
an increasing function of s is observed. Such a complex
structure is absent in SOC models, instead a maximum is
found in landslide inventory maps for small landslide data,
although there is no consensus about the nature of such a
feature [Stark and Hovius, 2001; Brardinoni and Church,
2004; Malamud et al., 2004]. The values of the power-law
exponent, α, by varying the rate, ν, and C are very close
to those experimentally found [Turcotte et al., 2002; Dus-
sauge et al., 2003]. As in the original isotropic OFC model
[Olami et al., 1992], the critical exponent decreases with the
level of conservation, C (see inset in ﬁgure 2). The value
of α slightly changes with the anisotropic ratios fd/fd and
fu/fd, except when they get too small [Piegari et al., 2005]
where, as found also in other models [Amitrano et al., 1999;
Amitrano, 2003; Faillettaz et al., 2004], the event size dis-
tribution is considerably modiﬁed. The power-law regime is
crucially robust to changes in system parameters. For in-
stance, in the case of ﬁgure 1 it can be found for ν up to
−2, all over the range C ∈ [0.4, 0.8]. It is
approximately 10
worth noting that the α values here obtained are comparable
to those found in models of failure in ﬁber bundle [Hemmer
et al., 1992; Hansen et al., 1994; Hidalgo et al., 2002].

As it can be seen in ﬁgure 1, a further increase of the driv-
ing rate (above ν ∼ 10−2) causes a crossover to a markedly
diﬀerent regime where power-laws are no longer apparent
and a bell shaped (Gaussian) distribution emerges, whose
peak shifts towards larger sizes and shrinks up. Such a be-
havior is to be expected since for strong driving rates all
internal correlations are washed out.

Summarizing, the conservation level, C, and the time
derivative of 1/F S, ν, turn out to be important to determine
landslide probability distributions: in the limit ν → 0, the
model is indeed in the SOC class; for small but ﬁnite ν the
system is at the edge of SOC and the critical behaviors are
still largely observed; ﬁnally, as ν gets large enough, Gaus-
sian properties are found. Thus, in the small ν regime, our
model reproduces the general properties of existing catalogs
and can help interpreting them, while in the large ν regime
it foresees a diﬀerent class of behavior. Nevertheless, for the
sake of clarity, we have considered the simple case where the
rates ν and C are uniform. Thus, the distributions of ﬁgure
1 may be not directly comparable to landslide inventories,
which gather events with non-uniform driving rates.

Pictures of a typical “avalanche” in the diﬀerent regimes
discussed above are plotted in ﬁgure 3 (upper panels) with
the corresponding values of the factor of safety, F Si, on the
model grid after the avalanche (lower panels). The snap-
shots in the upper panels, taken in two systems driven at
−2), show
diﬀerent rates (left ν = 5 · 10
a typical event with size s = 230 (such a value is chosen
because it has approximately the same probability in the
two cases, see ﬁgure 1): the system on the left is in the
power-law regime; the one on the right is in the non power-
law regime. The diﬀerence of the avalanche geometry in the
two cases is impressive. Domino eﬀects are crucial to de-
termine a “catastrophic” event when the system is governed

by a power-law statistics, where a huge compact landslide
is present [Pietronero and Schneider , 1991] with a typical
size of the order of the system size (left-upper panel). Con-
versely, large events are expected at higher ν (where indeed
the average size hsi is much larger than 230), but in such a
regime a typical event with s = 230 is made of many tiny
unconnected avalanches (summing up to s = 230).

Interestingly, even though the P (s) is very diﬀerent in the
two cases, the probability distribution, P (F S), of the spa-
tial values of F S on the grid has a similar Gaussian shape,
with comparable averages hF Si and ﬂuctuations h∆F S2i
−3;
(hF Si = 2.20 and h∆F S2i = 0.16 for ν = 5 · 10
−2) lay-
hF Si = 2.53 and h∆F S2i = 0.06 for ν = 5 · 10
ing far above the instability threshold F S = 1. Thus, a
measure of just an average safety factor on the investigated
area could provide only very partial information about the
statistics governing landslide events.

The origin of the striking diﬀerence of the P (s) in the
two considered cases traces back to the relative extension
of spatial correlations of the factor of safety, F S, which is
derived from the correlation function:

C(~z) =

hF S(~r)F S(~r + ~z)i − hF S(~r)i2
hF S(~r)2i − hF S(~r)i2

(2)

where F S(~x) is F S at position ~x (here we take ~z along
the direction of the slope) and the average is over the sys-
tem sites. As it is well-known [Jensen, 1998], we ﬁnd that
C(~z) ∝ exp(−z/ξ), where ξ is the spatial correlation length
of F S. The value of F Si on site i is shown in the lower pan-
els of ﬁgure 3, in gray scale, for the same cases pictured in
the upper panels: patterns of large correlated areas (regions
with similar values of F Si, i.e., the same color) are appar-
ent in the left bottom panel and, in practice, absent in the
right one. In the power-law regime (e.g., ν = 5 · 10−3), the
correlation length, ξ, is of the order of the system size; thus,
even a very small perturbation (say, a drop of water) at one
single point can trigger huge system responses. Instead, in
−2) large-scale cor-
the non power law regime (e.g., ν = 5 · 10
relations are absent; here, large events trivially occur just
because the strong external driving rate makes likely that
many cells simultaneously approach the instability thresh-
old. The detection of patterns of correlated domains (i.e.,
the size of ξ) in investigated areas results, thus, to be a
crucial tool to identify the response of the system to pertur-
bations, i.e., for hazard assessment.

Conclusions To summarize, we have investigated a
continuously driven anisotropic cellular automaton model
for the characterization of landslide size distributions. The
model may help in interpreting the general behaviors ob-
served in real systems.
In particular, we have found that
diﬀerent values of the driving rate give rise to diﬀerent sta-
tistical distributions of events. The determination of cor-
related domains in the factor of safety becomes crucial for
landslide classiﬁcation and, consequently, for hazard assess-
ment.

areas the avalanches shown in the corresponding upper

landslide events, as the lighter areas indicate regions of
future events. In the left ﬁgure large correlated regions

Application of the Yin-Yang grid to a thermal convection of a
Boussinesq ﬂuid with inﬁnite Prandtl number in a
three-dimensional spherical shell

A new numerical ﬁnite diﬀerence code has been devel-
oped to solve a thermal convection of a Boussinesq ﬂuid
with inﬁnite Prandtl number in a three-dimensional spheri-
cal shell. A kind of the overset (Chimera) grid named “Yin-
Yang grid” is used for the spatial discretization. The grid
naturally avoids the pole problems which are inevitable in
the latitude-longitude grids. The code is applied to numeri-
cal simulations of mantle convection with uniform and vari-
able viscosity. The validity of the Yin-Yang grid for the
mantle convection simulation is conﬁrmed.

1. Introduction

From the middle of 1980s, numerical simulation codes
for the thermal convection with inﬁnite Prandtl number in
three-dimensional (3-D) spherical shells have been developed
to solve the mantle convection of terrestrial planets. The dis-
cretization methods employed in these codes can be divided
into three categories; the spectral method [Machetel et al.,
1986; Glatzmaier, 1988; Bercovici et al., 1989; Zhang and
Yuen, 1995; Harder and Christensen, 1996], the ﬁnite ele-
ment (FE) method [Baumgardner, 1985; Bunge and Baum-
gardner, 1995; Zhong et al., 2000; Tabata and Suzuki, 2000;
Richards et al., 2001], and the ﬁnite volume (FV) method
[Ratcliﬀ et al., 1996; Iwase, 1996]. The spectral method,
which can be an eﬀective method for spherical ﬂows [e.g.,
Fornberg, 1996; Fornberg and Merrill, 1997], had found to
be unsuitable to mantle convection simulations because of
intense spatial variation of the viscosity of mantle rock. A
new method based on multilevel wavelet algorithm [Vasi-
lyev et al., 1997] can treat the spatially localized physical
properties and has a great potential usefulness in mantle
convection simulations. Its application to a spherical shell
model is, however, still remains a challenging task. Among
the grid-based FE, FV and ﬁnite diﬀerence (FD) schemes,
the FV and FD methods are more desirable than FE for mas-
sively parallel vector computers because of their feasibility
of optimization. Another advantage of the FD method is
its ﬂexibility; the extension to higher-order schemes, which
might be important to obtain accurate solutions of thermal
convection with very large Rayleigh numbers [e.g., Larsen
et al., 1997], is relatively easy.

One of the most popular computational grids in the spher-
ical polar coordinates (r, θ, φ) is latitude-longitude (θ, φ)-
grid, which is deﬁned by intersections of latitude and lon-
gitude circles on a sphere (Fig. 1a).
It is widely recog-
nized that the (θ, φ)-grid has the “pole problems” that
refer to two diﬀerent kinds of diﬃculty in numerical cal-
culations; one is the coordinate singularity on the poles

(θ = 0, π); and the other is the grid convergence near the
poles. The pole problems have been considered as serious
diﬃculties in the community of mantle convection simula-
tion. To avoid the coordinate singularity, special cares have
In the FV method, for example, all the
to been taken.
physical variables are arranged not to reside on the pole
grids [Ratcliﬀ et al., 1996; Iwase, 1996]. The problems
of the grid convergence is more serious than the coordi-
nate singularity:
It causes not only the grid redundancy,
but also the severe restriction on the time-step due to the
Courant-Friendrichs-Levy (CFL) condition.
In the (θ, φ)-
coordinates, the grid spacing on the spherical surfaces is
extremely non-uniform as Fig. 1a shows. The largest grid
spacing ∆X is given in the equator; ∆X = 2π/Nφ, where
Nφ is the grid number in the φ-direction, while the small-
est grid spacing ∆x is given at the nearest latitude to the
poles; ∆x = r sin(π/Nθ) × (2π/Nφ) ∼ 2π2r/(NθNφ), where
Nθ is the grid number in the θ-direction. So the ratio
∆X/∆x ∼ Nθ/π increases in proportional to the grid num-
ber. This means that the time-step restriction becomes ex-
tremely severe for large scale simulations with ﬁne grids. To
avoid the impractically small time-step, one has to invoke
quasi-uniform grid spacing over the sphere. The FE based
codes referred above employed carefully designed grid cells
for that purpose. For example, a FE mantle convection code
named CitcomS has nearly uniform resolution in both polar
and equatorial regions [Zhong et al., 2000]. However, a FD
or FV based mantle convection code that overcomes both of
the pole singularity and the grid convergence have not been
reported so far.

Here we employ a new grid system for spherical shell ge-
ometry, named “Yin-Yang grid”, which has been proposed
recently by Kageyama and Sato [2004]. The Yin-Yang grid
is composed of two component grids that have exactly the
same shape and size (Fig. 1b). They partially overlap each
other on their boundaries (Fig. 1c). Following the over-
set (Chimera) grid method [Chesshire and Henshaw, 1990],
data on the boundaries of the component grids are matched
by interpolation. A component grid of the Yin-Yang grid
is actually a low latitude part of the (θ, φ)-grid. As it is
apparent in Fig. 1b, the Yin-Yang grid has neither a coor-
dinate singularity, nor grid convergence; the grid spacings
are quasi-uniforms on the sphere (see Kageyama and Sato
[2004] for more details on this grid).

In this paper, we apply the Yin-Yang grid for the numeri-
cal simulation of mantle convection. To conﬁrm the validity
of the Yin-Yang grid, we have performed benchmark tests
with published numerical codes for steady convections. We
also apply the Ying-Yang grid for time-dependent mantle
convections with uniform and variable viscosity.

We model the mantle convection as a thermal convection
of a Boussinesq ﬂuid with inﬁnite Prandtl number heated

1

from bottom of a spherical shell. The ratio of the inner ra-
dius (r = r0) and the outer radius (r = r1) is 0.55. The
normalization factors for the non-dimensionalization of the
length, velocity, time and temperature are ˆr1 = 6371 km (the
Earth’s radius), ˆκ/ˆr1, ˆr2
1/ˆκ and ∆ ˆT = ˆTbot − ˆTtop, respec-
tively, where ˆκ is the thermal diﬀusivity, and ˆTbot and ˆTtop
are the temperatures on the bottom and top surfaces. The
hat stands for dimensional quantity. The non-dimensional
equations of mass, momentum, and energy conservation gov-
erning the thermal convection are,

∇ · v = 0,

0 = −∇p + ∇ · (η ˙ǫ) + RaζT er,

∂tT = ∇2

T − v · ∇T,

(1)

(2)

(3)

where v is the velocity vector, p the dynamic pressure,
˙ǫ the strain-rate tensor,
T the temperature, t the time,
and er is the unit vector in the r-direction. The con-
stant parameter ζ is ( ˆd/ˆr1)3 = 0.453, where ˆd is the
thickness of the shell, 2890 km (the Earth’s mantle). We
assume that viscosity η depends only on temperature;
η(T ) = ηref exp [−E (T − Tref )], where Tref is the refer-
ence temperature, and ηref is the reference viscosity at
Tref . The parameter E denotes the degree of viscosity con-
trast between the top and bottom surfaces. The viscos-
ity contrast across the spherical shell is deﬁned by γη ≡
η(Ttop)/η(Tbot) = exp(E). The Rayleigh number is deﬁned
by Ra ≡ ˆρˆg ˆα∆ ˆT ˆd3/ˆκˆηref , where ˆρ is the density, ˆg the
gravitational acceleration, and ˆα is the thermal expansivity.
The mechanical boundary conditions at the top and bottom
surface are immpermiable and stress-free. The boundary
conditions for T are Tbot = 1 and Ttop = 0.

We use the collocated grid method [e.g., Ferziger and
Peri´c, 2002]; all the primitive variables, v, p and T , are de-
ﬁned on the same grid points. Equations (1)-(3) are solved
by the FD discretization with second-order accuracy. The
SIMPLER algorithm [Patankar, 1980; Ferziger and Peri´c,
2002] is applied to solve v and p from eqs. (1) and (2).
The Crank-Nicolson method is used in eq. (3) for the time
stepping. The upwind diﬀerence method is applied for the
advection term in eq. (3). With the Yin-Yang grid method,
we simultaneously solve eqs. (1)-(3) for each component grid.
We use a successive over-relaxation (SOR) method as the it-
erative solver required in the SIMPLER algorithm and the
energy equation. The horizontal boundary values of each
component grid are determined by linear interpolation from
the other component grid. The interpolation is taken at
each SOR iteration. (We conﬁrmed that the interpolation
procedure has no numerical mischief on the calculations.)
The grid size is 102 × 102 × 204 (in r-, θ-, and φ-directions).
We have conﬁrmed that this size is enough to resolve all
the convections studied in this paper. Time development of
the convection is calculated until averaged quantities, such
as Nusselt number and root-mean-square velocity, become
stationary.

3. Benchmark Tests

The thermal convection in the spherical shell with in-
ﬁnite Prandtl number has two stable solutions with poly-
hedral symmetry when the Rayleigh number is low [e.g.,
Schubert et al., 2001]. The two solutions are found by lin-
ear theory [Busse, 1975; Busse and Riahi, 1982] and con-
ﬁrmed by numerical simulations [Bercovici et al., 1989; Rat-
cliﬀ et al., 1996]: One solution is a convection with the
tetrahedral symmetry which has four upwellings; the other

has the cubic symmetry with six upwellings. To conﬁrm
these symmetric solutions and their stabilities, we performed
two simulations with diﬀerent initial conditions of tem-
perature ﬁeld; T (r, θ, φ) = Tcond(r) + Tprtb(r, θ, φ), where
Tcond(r) = r0(r1 − r)/r(r1 − r0) is the purely conductive
proﬁle, i.e., ∇2Tcond(r) = 0, with the thermal boundary
conditions given above. The perturbation term Tprtb(r, θ, φ)
is given by,

We have performed benchmark tests with published nu-
merical mantle convection codes that employed various nu-
merical schemes. Following Richards et al.
[2001] and
Ratcliﬀ et al.
[1996], we performed simulations of uni-
form (γη = 1) and variable (γη = 20) viscosity convec-
tions with both the tetrahedral and cubic steady symme-
−1 and ω = 0 (i.e., no secondary per-
tries when λ = 10
turbations). The Rayleigh number Ra1/2 is deﬁned by the
reference viscosity ηref at Tref = 0.5 [Ratcliﬀ et al., 1996].
Nusselt number at the surface and root-mean-square ve-
locity of entire domain were calculated on convections at
Ra1/2 = 2.0×103 ∼ 1.4×104. The results of the benchmark
tests are summarized in Table 1. In spite of the diﬀerences of
the discretization methods, numerical techniques, and num-
ber of grid points among the codes, we found that the results
from our code agree well with them within a few percent or
even better and conﬁrmed the validity of our code.

4. Unsteady Convection Problems

The steady convections become time-dependent when the
Rayleigh number is increased. Since the Earth’s mantle
is obviously time-dependent convection with high Rayleigh
number, the transition of convection from steady to un-
steady state is important. We tried a series of simulations
with various Rabot (the Rayleigh number deﬁned by the ref-
erence viscosity at the bottom surface, i.e., Tref = Tbot) from
the critical number for convection onset (≈ 712) [Ratcliﬀ et
al., 1996] to 105. The perturbation amplitudes λ and ω are
−3, respectively. Shown in Fig. 2
taken to be 10
are the iso-surfaces of temperature at Rabot = 104 and 105
after 200,000 time-steps. Figure 2a and 2b indicate that, at
Rabot = 104, the convection patterns are in steady states,
maintaining each symmetry, in spite of the existence of the
secondary perturbations in the initial conditions. This is
consistent with earlier results [Bercovici et al., 1989; Rat-
cliﬀ et al., 1996] in which the secondary perturbation was
not explicitly imposed, i.e., ω = 0, though.

−1 and 10

When Rabot = 105, the convection patterns become
weakly time-dependent. The geometrical symmetry in this
Rayleigh number is broken. This disagrees with the result of
Ratcliﬀ et al. [1996]. Notice that, in the right panel of Fig.
2b, all the six upwelling plumes have the same diameters in
our results. The corresponding case by Ratcliﬀ et al. [1996],
in which a FV scheme on the (θ, φ)-grid is used, shows a
symmetric pattern about equator and appears to remain in

a steady state [cf. Ratcliﬀ et al., 1996, Fig. 6]. These obser-
vations suggest that the low Rayleigh number convections
around Rabot = 105 are numerically aﬀected by coordinate
singularity and the grid convergence in the (θ, φ)-grid. On
the other hand, the pole eﬀects are removed in our code by
making use of the Yin-Yang grid.

It is known that variable viscosity with strong tempera-
ture dependence induces drastic eﬀects on the convection
pattern in 3-D Cartesian model with large aspect ratio
and also in the spherical shell model [Ratcliﬀ et al., 1997;
Trompert and Hansen, 1998]. To conﬁrm this eﬀect in our
model, we performed simulations with variable viscosity.
Taking eq. (4) as the initial temperature perturbation, we
ﬁrst calculated an isoviscous convection at Rabot = 106. The
obtained solution, which is shown in Fig. 3a, is strongly
time-dependent and exhibits complex feature in contrast to
the case at Rabot = 105 (the right panel of Fig. 2a). We grad-
ually increased γη from 1 (isoviscous case) up to 103. We
obtained a convection regime that has cold and rather thick
thermal boundary layer on the top surfaces (Fig. 3b). The
large aspect ratio of convecting cells in this regime is consis-
tent with the previous results obtained by the 3-D Cartesian
model with large aspect ratio as well as spherical shell model
with moderately strong temperature-dependence of viscos-
ity (γη = 103) [Ratcliﬀ et al., 1997]. Our results show that
the underlying convection patterns with larger aspect ratio
of degree-2 come to dominate. The two cells structure that
consists of one sheet-like downwelling along a great circle of
spherical shell and two mushroom-shaped upwelling plumes
is formed.

5. Conclusions and Discussion

We have developed a new numerical simulation code to
solve the thermal convection of a Boussinesq ﬂuid with in-
ﬁnite Prandtl number using a second-order FD method on
newly devised spherical overset grid named Yin-Yang grid.
The validity of the Yin-Yang grid for the mantle convec-
tion simulation is conﬁrmed by benchmark tests. Our code
is powerful and unique FD based code that can solve both
the uniform and the strongly variable viscosity convections.
The Yin-Yang grid is suitable to solve the mantle convection
problems because it automatically avoids the pole problems
that are inevitable on the (θ, φ)-grid. In the isoviscous case
with cubic symmetry at Rabot = 105, the convection pattern
has a weak time-dependence in our Yin-Yang grid, while it
was steady with strange asymmetry of the plume sizes be-
tween those on the poles and those in the equator in the pre-
vious FV scheme on the (θ, φ)-grid. This discrepancy might
be a consequence of the grid convergence near poles in the
(θ, φ)-grid. Our result implies that large-scale (low degree)
convective structures are easily aﬀected numerically by the
poles when (θ, φ)-grid is employed. The quadrulpole convec-
tion patterns is obtained when large viscosity contrast with
three orders of magnitude is introduced when Rabot = 106.
To follow mantle convection for geophysical time-scale
(∼108 years), the computational time-step ∆t is critically
important in numerical simulations. As we described in sec-
tion 1, the time-step is determined by the CFL condition
by the smallest grid spacing. For (θ, φ)-grid, ∆x(= ∆xθφ)
is determined by the azimuthal grid spacing at the nearest
grids to the pole. On the other hand for the Yin-Yang grid,
∆x(= ∆xY Y ) is determined by the azimuthal grid spacing
at θ = π/4 (or 3π/4). Therefore the ratio of time-steps Γt
between two grids is,

Γt ∝ ∆xθφ/∆xY Y = sin(π/Nθ)/ sin(π/4) ≈ 1.4π/Nθ. (6)

Taking Nθ = 102 as employed in this paper, Γt ≈ 0.04. This
means that the total computational time is signiﬁcantly re-
duced by the factor of 1/25 by making use of the Yin-Yang
grid.

Why dynamos are prone to reversals

F. Stefani, G. Gerbeth, U. G¨unther, M. Xu

In a recent paper [1] it was shown that a simple mean-ﬁeld dynamo model with a spherically
symmetric helical turbulence parameter α can exhibit a number of features which are typical for
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld reversals. In particular, the model produces asymmetric reversals (with a
slow decay of the dipole of one polarity and a fast recreation of the dipole with opposite polarity),
a positive correlation of ﬁeld strength and interval length, and a bimodal ﬁeld distribution. All
these features are attributable to the magnetic ﬁeld dynamics in the vicinity of an exceptional point
of the spectrum of the non-selfadjoint dynamo operator where two real eigenvalues coalesce and
continue as a complex conjugated pair of eigenvalues. Usually, this exceptional point is associated
with a nearby local maximum of the growth rate dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number.
The negative slope of this curve between the local maximum and the exceptional point makes the
system unstable and drives it to the exceptional point and beyond into the oscillatory branch where
the sign change happens. A weakness of this reversal model is the apparent necessity to ﬁne-tune the
magnetic Reynolds number and/or the radial proﬁle of α in order to adjust the operator spectrum
in an appropriate way. In the present paper, it is shown that this ﬁne-tuning is not necessary in
the case of higher supercriticality of the dynamo. Numerical examples and physical arguments are
compiled to show that, with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, there is strong tendency for the
exceptional point and the associated local maximum to move close to the zero growth rate line where
the indicated reversal scenario can be actualized. Although exempliﬁed again by the spherically
symmetric α2 dynamo model, the main idea of this ”self-tuning” mechanism of saturated dynamos
into a reversal-prone state seems well transferable to other dynamos. As a consequence, reversing
dynamos might be much more typical and may occur much more frequently in nature than what
could be expected from a purely kinematic perspective.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The magnetic ﬁeld of the Earth is known to undergo
irregular reversals of its dipole part. The reversal rate is
variable in the course of time: it was nearly zero in the
Kiaman and the Cretaceous superchrons and is approxi-
mately 5 per Myr in the present [2].

Much eﬀort has been devoted to identify typical char-
acteristics of the reversal process. In particular, it was
claimed that reversals may have an asymmetric, saw-
toothed shape, with the ﬁeld of one polarity decaying
slowly and recreating rapidly with opposite polarity, pos-
sibly to quite high intensities [3, 4, 5].

Another hypothesis concerns a correlation between the
polarity interval length and the magnetic ﬁeld intensity
[6, 7]. Associated with this, a causal connection of the
Cretaceous superplume and superchron period has been
discussed [8, 9]. It was Vogt who ﬁrst suggested a cor-
relation between volcanism and reversal rate [10]. The
general idea behind this is that superplumes give rise to
an increased heat transport from the core mantle bound-
ary to the Earth surface with the result of an increased
dynamo strength due to a higher temperature gradient
driving the outer core ﬂow [11]. While this idea was
soon generally accepted (with some counter-arguments
regarding the involved time-scales [12]), quite contrary
implications for the reversal frequency were drawn from
it. The ﬁrst ”school”, advocating a negative correlation
of interval length and energy supply to the dynamo, goes
back to Loper and McCartney [13]. The second school,

suspecting long intervals for a strong dynamo, was mo-
tivated by various mean-ﬁeld dynamo models, for which
a transition from anharmonic oscillations to superchrons
for increasing magnetic Reynolds number was observed
[14].

A third, and still controversially discussed observation
concerns the bimodal distribution of the Earth’s virtual
dipole moment (VDM) with two peaks at about 4 × 1022
Am2 and at about twice that value [15, 16, 17].

For decades, it has been a challenge for dynamo the-
oreticians to explain reversals and their characteristics.
It was considered a breakthrough when Glatzmaier and
Roberts observed a reversal process in their fully coupled
three-dimensional simulation of the geodynamo [18] (cf.
also [19] for a recent overview). The strange thing with
these simulations is that they reproduce many features
of Earth magnetic ﬁelds, including reversals, quite well
despite the fact that they are working in parameter re-
gions far beyond those of the real Earth. This deﬁciency
applies, in particular, to the Ekman and the magnetic
Prandtl number. A way out of this dilemma may lie with
a reliable sub-grid scale modeling [20]. In this respect one
should also notice recent eﬀorts to link direct numerical
simulations and mean-ﬁeld dynamo models [21, 22].

This brings us back from expensive simulations to the
complementary tradition of understanding reversals in
terms of reduced dynamo models. A very simple ap-
proach in this direction is the celebrated Rikitake dy-
namo of two coupled disk dynamos [23, 24].

Another model was studied by Hoyng and collabora-

tors [25, 26, 27]. A mean-ﬁeld dynamo model is reduced
to an equation system for the amplitudes of the non-
periodic axisymmetric dipole mode and for one periodic
overtone under the inﬂuence of stochastic forcing. This
simple model, which produces sudden reversals and a
Poissonian distribution of the interval time, has also been
employed to simulate the phenomenon of stochastic reso-
nance [28]. Stochastic resonance was made responsible in
a former paper [29] for an apparent 100 kyr periodicity in
the interval length distribution [30] (note however, that
this periodicity is not settled yet [31]). An essential in-
gredient of Hoyng’s model to explain the correct reversal
duration and the interval length consistently is the use
of a large turbulent resistivity which is hardly justiﬁed.
At least nothing of this has been seen in the recent liquid
sodium dynamo experiments [32].

A further approach to understand reversals relies on
the transition between non-oscillatory and oscillatory
eigenmodes of the dynamo operator [33, 34, 35]. Those
transition points, which have been found in many dy-
namo models [36, 37], are well known in operator the-
ory as spectral branch points — ”exceptional points” of
branching type of non-selfadjoint operators [38]. Such
branch points are characterized not only by coalescing
eigenvalues but also by a coalescence of two or more (geo-
metric) eigenvectors and the formation of a non-diagonal
Jordan block structure with associated vectors (algebraic
eigenvectors) [39, 40, 41]. This is in contrast to ”diabol-
ical points” [42] which are exceptional points of an acci-
dential crossing of two or more spectral branches with an
unchanged diagonal block structure of the operator and
without coalescing eigenvectors [38, 40].

In a recent paper [1], we have analyzed the magnetic
ﬁeld dynamics in the vicinity of an exceptional point in
more detail. Although the used model, a mean-ﬁeld dy-
namo of the α2 type with a supposed spherically symmet-
ric helical turbulence paramter α, is certainly far beyond
the reality of the Earth dynamo (owing, in particular, to
the missing North-South-asymmetry of α) it exhibited all
mentioned reversal features: asymmetry, a positive cor-
relation of ﬁeld strength and interval length, and bimodal
ﬁeld distribution.

All those features together were attributed to the very
peculiar magnetic ﬁeld dynamics in the vicinity of an
exceptional point. Usually, this exceptional point is as-
sociated with a local maximum of the growth rate curve
at a slightly lower magnetic Reynolds number.

If this local maximum lies above zero, then there is a
stable ﬁxed point to the left of it. However, any prevailing
noise can trigger the system to switch to the unstable
ﬁxed point at the right of the local maximum. From
there the system is driven, in an self-accelerating way,
to the exceptional point and beyond into the oscillatory
branch where it undergoes the very polarity change and
comes back to one of the ﬁxed points.

If the local maximum is below zero, the system un-
dergoes an anharmonic oscillation (a limit cycle) with a
pronounced asymmetry of the ”reversal”. However, noise

2

can lift the local maximum above zero making the sys-
tem stay in the ﬁxed point for a while before resuming
the anharmonic oscillation.

This reversal scenario seems not unrealistic since it
exhibits at least three reversal characteristics with only
demanding the existence of an exceptional point and a
nearby local maximum of the growth rate. The bad news
is that it seems to require an artiﬁcial ﬁne-tuning of the
intensity and/or the spatial distribution of the dynamo
source, in order to position the exceptional point and its
accompanying local maximum close to the zero line. By
checking a variety of α proﬁles in the kinematic regime,
we have indeed observed that the spectral structure as
it is necessary for reversals to happen occurs only sel-
dom. Hence, the criticism that our particular choice of
α(r) has not enough geophysical background to explain
reversal [21], seems well justiﬁed.

Thus motivated, it is the main goal of the present paper
to ﬁnd better arguments why a dynamo operator should
have a reversal-prone spectrum. A ﬁrst hint on the solu-
tion of this puzzle can be found in the papers by Bran-
denburg et al. [43] and by Meinel and Brandenburg [44].
For a mean-ﬁeld disc dynamo (which is rather a model
for galactic than for planetary dynamos), it was shown
[44] that a dynamo in the highly supercritical regime can
exhibit a pronounced reversal behaviour, although this
would not be expected from considering only the kine-
matic proﬁles of α.

In the present paper we will verify if this behaviour
in the highly supercritical regime can be understood in
terms of the ”exceptional point model”. Our main out-
come will be that there is a strong tendency of saturated
dynamos to evolve into a reversal-prone state where the
condition, that the exceptional point and the local maxi-
mum are situated close to the zero line, is indeed fulﬁlled.
Applied to the Earth, a possible conclusion could be that
reversals are rather due to a self-tuning of the saturated
dynamo operator than to an accidental ﬁne-tuning of the
kinematic dynamo operator.

II. THE MODEL

Instead of simulating the real Earth dynamo with a
fully coupled three-dimensional solver, we employ a very
simple mean-ﬁeld dynamo model in order to work out
clearly the basic mechanism of reversals.

The considered α2 dynamo with a spherically symmet-
ric helical turbulence parameter α leads to a system of
two coupled partial diﬀerential equations with only one
spatial variable (the radius). This model is simple enough
to allow for long-time simulations providing reasonable
reversal statistics, but at the same time it is still com-
plex enough to catch the essence of hydromagnetic dy-
namos. In contrast to their technical counterparts, the
saturation of hydromagnetic dynamos relies strongly on
the deformability of the dynamo source which is, in our
case, the variable radial dependence of α. Note that in

the quite diﬀerent context of the Riga dynamo experi-
ment a similar one-dimensional back-reaction model was
used which reﬂects also the hydromagnetic character of
this dynamo experiment in contrast to experiments with
a more constraint geometric ﬂexibility [45, 46].

The magnetic ﬁeld evolution of a kinematic α2 dynamo

is governed by the induction equation

∂B
∂τ

= ∇ × (αB) +

∆B ,

form

with α denoting the helical turbulence parameter which
may depend on the position r and the time τ [47]. The
dynamo acts, within a sphere of radius R, in a ﬂuid with
electrical conductivity σ. The magnetic ﬁeld has to be
divergence-free, ∇ · B = 0. In what follows, the length
will be measured in units of R, the time in units of µ0σR2,
and the parameter α in units of (µ0σR)−1. Note that for
the Earth we get a typical time scale µ0σR2 ∼ 200 kyr,
which results in a free decay time of 20 kyr for the dipole
ﬁeld.

It is convenient to decompose B into a poloidal and a
toroidal ﬁeld component according to B = −∇ × (r ×
∇S) − r × ∇T . The deﬁning scalars S and T are then
expanded in spherical harmonics of degree l and order m
with the expansion coeﬃcients sl,m(r, τ ) and tl,m(r, τ ).

For the present case with α(r) = α(r), the induction
equation decouples for each l and m into the following
pair of equations:

(3)

The boundary conditions are ∂sl/∂r|r=1 + (l + 1)sl(1) =
tl(1) = 0.
In the following we focus our attention on
the dipole mode with l = 1, and will henceforth skip the
corresponding subscript of s and t; s := s1 and t := t1.
The absence of the order m in Eqs. (2,3) follows from
the spherical symmetry of α.
It implies, in particular,
a complete degeneration of axial and equatorial dipole
modes. It is clear that for any more realistic model (e.g.
with inclusion of the North-South asymmetry of α) this
degeneration would be lifted.

Let us assume that the proﬁle of α in the kinematic
regime, αkin(r), represents a supercritical dynamo. Af-
ter self-excitation has occurred, magnetic ﬁeld saturation
is ensured by quenching the parameter α. We do this
with the angularly averaged magnetic ﬁeld energy which
can be expressed in terms of s(r, t) and t(r, t) [48]. This
averaging over the angles, which represents a severe sim-
pliﬁcation, has been introduced in order to remain within
the framework of the spherically symmetric α2 model. In
reality, of course, any quenching would introduce terms
breaking the spherically symmetry of α.

3

In addition to the quenching eﬀect, we assume the α-
proﬁle to be aﬀected by ”blobs” of noise which are consid-
ered constant within a correlation time τcorr. Physically,
this noise is not unnatural:
it could be understood as
a consequence of changing boundary conditions for the
core ﬂow, but also as a shorthand for the omitted inﬂu-
ence of higher multipole modes on the dominant dipole
mode.

Putting all together, α(r) takes on the time dependent

In the numerical scheme, the noise term Ξ(r, τ ) will be
treated in form of a Taylor expansion,

Ξ(r, t) = ξ1(τ ) + ξ2(τ ) r2 + ξ3(τ ) r3 + ξ4(τ ) r4 ,

(6)

with the noise correlation given by hξi(τ )ξj (τ + τ1)i =
D2(1 − |τ1|/τcorr)Θ(1 − |τ1|/τcorr)δij .

In summary, our model is governed by four parameters,
the magnetic Reynolds number C, the noise amplitude D,
a mean magnetic energy E0
mag in the saturated regime,
and the noise correlation time τcorr.

The equation system (2)-(4) is time-stepped using an
Adams-Bashforth method. For the following examples,
the correlation time τcorr has been set to 0.02, and E0
mag
has been chosen to be 100. The details of these choices
are not very relevant. Roughly speaking, a shorter corre-
lation time τcorr would require a stronger noise amplitude
D in order to yield the same eﬀect.

III. ANHARMONIC OSCILLATIONS IN THE
VICINITY OF EXCEPTIONAL POINTS

In [1] we had considered the following particular form

of the kinematic α proﬁle:

αkin(r) = C(−21.5 + 426.4 r2 − 806.7 r3 + 392.3 r4). (7)

Actually, this strange-looking Taylor expansion was the
result of an Evolution Strategy search for oscillatory
spherically symmetric α2 dynamos [49]. For this α(r)
proﬁle, the growth rate dependence on C is shown as
curve K1 in Fig. 1b. ”K” stands for kinematic, and the
subscript ”1” indicates the eigenfunction with the radial
wavenumber 1. Correspondingly, K2 denotes the eigen-
function with the radial wavenumber 2. K1 and K2 coa-
lesce at the (leftmost) exceptional point E and continue
as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues. At the upper
exceptional point E’, the curves K1 and K2 split oﬀ again
into a pair of real eigenvalues.

The critical value for this α(r) proﬁle, C = 1, lies on
the oscillatory branch, enclosed between the two excep-
tional points E and E’. For slightly supercritical values
of C, the time evolution is a nearly harmonic oscillation
that becomes more and more anharmonic and asymmet-
ric with increasing C.

2a). Governed by Eqs.

At C = 1.2785 this oscillation acquires nearly a rect-
angular form (Fig. 1a). For this extremely anharmonic
oscillation we analyze, at the eight diﬀerent instants 1...8
shown in Fig. 1a, the corresponding instantaneous pro-
ﬁles α(r, τ ) (Fig.
(4) and
(5), these instantaneous proﬁles depend on the instan-
taneous magnetic ﬁeld variables s(r, τ ) and t(r, τ ), which
are shown in Figs. 2b and 2c, respectively. For each
of these instantaneous α proﬁles, the full squares on the
vertical dashed line in Fig. 1b show the resulting instan-
taneous growth rate.
In order to identify the position
of these points with respect to the exceptional point, we
put them in the context of a whole growth rate curve, by
artiﬁcially replacing the value C = 1.2785 of the actual
quenched α proﬁle by values between 0.7 and 1.4. This
way we obtain the thin lines 1...8 in Fig. 1b which makes
it possible to interprete a reversal in terms of the consec-
utive deformation of the original kinematic growth rate
curve.

Let us begin with the instant 1. The magnetic ﬁeld
(Fig. 2b, 2c) is high, therefore the quenching of α is
also quite strong (Fig. 2a). The resulting instantaneous
growth rate (Fig. 1b) sits nearby the local maximum
which is slightly below zero. Hence, the ﬁeld starts to
decay slowly.

At the instant 2, the ﬁeld has already weakened, the
quenching of α is less pronounced as before, and the point
of the instantaneous growth rate has moved in between
the local maximum and the exceptional point. At the
instants 3 and 4, characterized by even weaker ﬁelds and
less quenching of α, the growth rate point has reached
the oscillatory branch. It follows a short intermezzo in
the higher non-oscillatory branch (instant 5) where the
α proﬁle has nearly taken on the unquenched shape. Af-
ter this, the system returns via the oscillatory branch
(instant 6) to the reversed state at instants 7 and 8. It
should be noted that this reversal scenario does not need
any dramatic change or even a total sign reversal of α,
as it was proposed e.g. in [50].

Readers familiar with the van der Pol oscillator [51]
may notice that the signal form of Fig. 1a resembles
strongly a ”relaxation oscillation” (we thank Clement
Narteau for drawing our attention to this point).
In-
deed, a closer inspection of the dynamics of the van der
Pol oscillator shows a similar behaviour of the leading
instantaneous eigenvalues.

At C = 1.2789, the local maximum of the growth rate
crosses the zero line, and instead of the considered limit
cycle in form of an anharmonic oscillation we get two
ﬁxed points (the crossing points of the growth rate curve
with zero). The ﬁxed point at the left of the local maxi-
mum is a stable one. So it will need some noise to jump

In this regime, the interval
length is not anymore governed by the intrinsic frequency
of the anharmonic oscillation, but by the intensity of the
noise which triggers transition from the stable ﬁxed point
to the unstable ﬁxed point.

IV. SATURATION INTO REVERSAL-PRONE
STATES

After the short review of [1] given in the last section, we
are left with the impression that the indicated reversal
scenario depends heavily on an artiﬁcial ﬁne-tuning of
the shape and the intensity of the α(r) proﬁle.

In this section we will try to ﬁnd better arguments
for dynamos to be in a reversal-prone state. For this
purpose, we change our focus from slightly supercritical
dynamos to highly supercritical dynamos.

One comment is due in advance. The very particular
α proﬁle in Eq. (7) was the outcome of an Evolutionary
Strategy search for an oscillatory and dominant dipole
mode.
In [49] it was shown that this double demand
constrains the variety of possible α(r) proﬁles to a rather

thin corridor. It is much easier to ﬁnd proﬁles α(r) with
an oscillatory l = 1 mode for which some higher multipole
modes with l = 2, 3, .. are dominant.
In order not to
overcomplicate the problem, in the following discussion
we lift the demand for a dominant dipole mode by simply
omitting any consideration of higher dipole modes.

Let us start with the classical proﬁle αkin(r) = C
which is known to possess only real eigenvalues for all C
[47]. For the sake of concreteness, we consider the criti-
cal value C = 4.49 and the supercritical values C = 10,
20, and 50. We solve the induction equation system (2)
and (3) coupled to the quenching equations (4) and (5).
The quenched α proﬁles, α(r) = C/(1 + Emag(r)/E0
mag),
which are shown in Fig. 3b, are then multiplied by a
scaling parameter C∗, and the resulting instantaneous
growth rate curves in dependence on C∗ are shown in
Fig. 3a. As in the former section, this procedure is in-
tended to identify the position of the actual growth rate
point with respect to the exceptional point.

Fig. 3b shows that the quenching of α is not homoge-

nous along the radius. The saturation mechanism modi-
ﬁes the original constant α in such a way that there is a
stronger suppression for smaller radii (evidently, because
the magnetic ﬁeld is strongest in the central part of the
dynamo). This modiﬁcation of the shape of α has a re-
markable consequence for the spectrum. In Fig. 3a we
see that the growth rate curves acquire an exceptional
point which is moving toward the zero growth rate line
with increasing C. In this particular example, the excep-
tional point does not drop below zero. Nevertheless, we
will ﬁnd later (Fig. 9a) that even in this case the noise
can trigger reversals.

The next example, αkin = 5/3 C r2, is illustrated in
Fig. 4 (the factor 5/3 results from normalizing the radial
average of α(r) to the value for constant α). The general
tendency is the same as for the previous example αkin =
C, but now the exceptional point drops clearly below the
zero line, leaving the maximum of this curve only slightly
above zero. For C = 50, say, the dynamo will ”sit” on
the stable ﬁxed point at the left of the local maximum.
At this point the ﬁeld is rather strong. However, any
noise can trigger a move to the unstable ﬁxed point at
the right of the local maximum from where the reversal
process can start.

The next example is αkin = 6/3 C r3. Here the local
maximum drops below the zero line for C = 20 and 50

the exceptional point well above the zero line and back to it.

(Fig. 5). That means there is no stable ﬁxed point any-
more, the system runs into a limit cycle in form of the
previously analyzed anharmonic oscillation. Therefore,
α is changing its shape during this process. The curves
”20 (m)” and ”50 (m)” refer to those α proﬁles which are
maximally quenched during the oscillation.

The last example, αkin(r) = 5.75/3 C (1−6r2+5r3), is
quite similar to the example from [1], but it will provide
a surprise (Fig. 6). Starting from the kinematic α, for
which the exceptional point is well below the zero line,
it rises rapidly above zero to a maximum value, but for
even higher C it moves back in direction of the zero line.
Evidently, there are tow diﬀerent mechanisms at work
here.

All four considered examples exhibit a tendency for su-
percritical dynamos to saturate in a state for which the
exceptional point and its associated local maximum lie
close to the zero growth rate line. Interestingly enough,
this happens independently on whether the exceptional
point in the kinematic case was above the zero line (in-
cluding the limiting case that there was no exceptional
case at all) or below it.

What is the physical rationale behind this phe-
nomenon? Back-reaction for hydromagnetic dynamos is
quite generally an actualization of Lenz’s rule stating
that the excited magnetic ﬁeld acts against the source of

that the α proﬁle is deformed in such a way that the

growth rate is decreasing.
this makes the growth rate curve of the leading eigen-
mode come closer to the growth rate curve for the next
but leading eigenmode (Fig. 7a). As a results, the back-
reaction has a tendency to move the exceptional point
downward in direction of the zero line (Fig. 7a).

While this argument is rather intuitive for the ﬁrst
three examples, it does not apply to the fourth example
in which an exceptional point is already existent below
the zero line. Again, back-reaction is expected to lower
the growth rate, but now the most eﬃcient way to do this
is quite diﬀerent. Figure 7b may help to illustrate the es-
sential point. The eigenvalues with radial wave numbers
n = 1 and n = 2 have already coalesced and formed an
oscillatory eigenmode below the zero line, but soon after
they split again into a pair of real eigenvalues. The very
steep increase of the leading eigenvalue in this upper real
branch is quite typical and is the heritage of the level
repulsion which would have occurred for a dynamo op-
erator with a slightly modiﬁed α proﬁle which is closer
to the constant one. Therefore, the most eﬃcient way
of back-reaction in this case is to decrease the steepness
of this leading eigenvalue branch. The decrease of the
steepness goes hand in hand with a lengthening of the
oscillatory branch. This saturation mechanism is so eﬃ-
cient that the local maximum and the exceptional point
are even risen up towards the zero line and beyond. Only
later, when the exceptional point is already well above
the zero line, any further increase of C will promote the
previous saturation mechanism, driving the exceptional
point again back to the zero line (cf. Fig. 6).

At present, work is in progress to support this rather
intuitive and numerically derived picture by a paradig-
matic analytical model.

In some respect, this self-tuning mechanism is similar
to the concept of self-organized criticality [52], although
it seems too early to over-stress this resemblance.

V. TIME SERIES AND REVERSAL DURATION

The time evolution of the considered dynamos is, in the
noise-free case, determined by the position of the local
maximum of the growth rate curve relative to the zero
line.
If the local maximum is below zero, than we get
a limit cycle in form of an anharmonic oscillation, the
mechanism of which has been described in detail above
and in [1]. If the local maximum is situated well above
the zero line, then the system runs into a stable ﬁxed
point. In case that the maximum is only slightly above
zero, than a hysteretic behaviour may occur, in which
the choice of the stable ﬁxed point or the limit cycle is
controlled by the strength of the pre-existing magnetic
ﬁeld.

A quantity which is of particular geophysical relevance
is the duration of a reversal. Here is not the place to

discuss the variety of diﬀerent deﬁnitions, and all ques-
tions concerning the dependence of the apparent reversal
duration on the site latitude [53]. Since our model relies
exclusively on the evolution of the dipole ﬁeld, we cannot
use any deﬁnitions based on directional changes. For that
reason we had employed in [1] a ”working deﬁnition” of a
reversal duration, based on the period during which the
modulus of the magnetic ﬁeld is smaller than a certain
percentage of the amplitude of the (anharmonic) oscil-
lation. For a value of 25 percent (which was motivated
by demanding the dipole ﬁeld to decay until this value
in order that the non-dipole ﬁeld can become dominant)
we obtained a reversal duration of 0.15 τdif f . For an as-
sumed diﬀusion time of 200 kyr, this would amount to
30 kyr.

Now we would like to know how this reversal duration
changes with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, in
particular for highly supercritical dynamos. In Fig. 8 we

with the particular values C = 20, 50, 100, and 200. The

kyr for the Earth. Evidently, the reversal duration decreases
signiﬁcantly with increasing C and reaches values of ∼ 10 kyr
for large C.

plot the details of the reversal process for the third exam-
ple of the previous section, αkin(r) = 6/3 C r3. For C we
have chosen the four values 20, 50, 100, and 200. What-
ever the exact deﬁnition of a reversal might be, the ten-
dency is clear: with increasing C, the reversal duration
decreases signiﬁcantly. This has to do with the fact that
during the reversal the magnetic ﬁeld gets weak and the
α proﬁle comes close to its unquenched, kinematic shape
for which extremely high instantaneous growth rates and
frequencies (only in the oscillatory branch) occur. These
are responsible for a very fast reversal process.
If we
would deﬁne the reversal duration as the period during
which the ﬁeld is between ± 50 percent of the oscillation
amplitude, we would get for C = 200 a time span of 0.03
τdif f , corresponding to 6 kyr. The corresponding time
for C = 20 is 0.09 τdif f , i.e. 18 kyr. Evidently, we can
get a realistic time scale without taking resort to turbu-
lent resistivity, as it was done in other reversal models
[25].

So far, we have considered the noise-free case. As al-
ready remarked, the role of noise depends on the position
of the local maximum of the growth rate curve relative
to the zero line. If it is above zero, the dynamo is usu-
ally at the ﬁxed point characterized by a strong magnetic
ﬁeld, then the noise can trigger transitions to the unsta-
ble ﬁxed point at the right of the local maximum, from
where a reversal process can start. However, although
being unstable, this ﬁxed point can hold the system for
a while (since the growth rate is zero there) making a
second peak in the ﬁeld strength histogram possible [1].
If the local maximum is below zero, making the dynamo
undergo anharmonic oscillations with a weak ﬁeld ampli-
tude, then the noise can make it jump time by time to
the strong ﬁeld state.

Anyway, the noise will soften the diﬀerences between
the two regimes with the local maximum below or above
zero. In either case, there will be noise-strength depen-
dent exchange between the ﬁxed point state with a strong

In Figs. 9 and 10 this is illustrated by some typical
time series for the four dynamo examples considered in
the previous section. In all cases we have chosen C = 50.
The noise intensity, D has been set to 4, apart from the
ﬁrst example with αkin = C for which a value of D = 7
has been chosen to provoke any reversal at all.

Apart from details concerning the mean reversal rate
and the transient excursions to rather high values, all the
signals share the property that there are long time inter-
vals without reversals and rather fast reversal processes.
A last remark concerns the long-standing problem of
positive or negative correlation of energy supply and in-
terval length. Our model is not able to solve this prob-
lem, but it can illustrate its intricacy. The ﬁrst point
is that any additional energy supply will increase both
the magnetic Reynolds number C and the noise level D.
Even if considered separately from D, the inﬂuence of C
depends on whether it will lift or lower the local maxi-
mum with respect to the zero line. We have seen that
both can happen, but for high supercriticality there is a
general tendency of lowering the local maximum. This
would imply a negative correlation of energy supply and
interval length. If considering the inﬂuence of D sepa-
rately from C, we get also a complicated behaviour with
a tendency toward a negative correlation of D and the

case that the local maximum is below zero and the noise

very complex picture with no deﬁnite answer.

reversals can a) be asymmetric, b) yield a positive cor-
relation of dynamo strength and interval length, and c)
show a pronounced bimodal ﬁeld distribution. All three
features have been recently discussed as being typical for
reversals of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.

The apparent weakness of this model, the necessity of
ﬁne-tuning the spatial structure of the dynamo source
in order to bring the exceptional point and its associ-
ated local growth rate maximum close to the zero line,
has been overcome in the present paper. We have shown
that the back-reaction of the magnetic ﬁeld has a strong
tendency to drive the dynamo into a state where the indi-
cated spectral conditions for reversals are indeed fulﬁlled.
This shows that dynamos with a high, but not neces-
sarily extreme, supercritical magnetic Reynolds number
are very prone to reversals. Hence, the proposed reversal
scenario which might look contrived and hardly realistic
from a purely kinematic point of view, becomes rather
natural when seen from the side of the saturation pro-
cess. The artiﬁcial ﬁne-tuning for the regime of slightly
supercritical dynamos is replaced by a self-tuning satu-
ration into reversal prone states when it comes to highly
supercritical dynamos.

The question remains if the Earth’s dynamo is indeed
highly supercritical. A ﬁrst estimate of the magnetic
Reynolds number, based on a length scale of 2000 km,
a velocity scale of 5 mm/s, and a magnetic diﬀusivity
of λ := (µσ)−1 ∼ 2 m2/s [54], provides Rm ∼ 500. At
least, and apart from all uncertainties, this number does
not exclude a highly supercritical state. Hence, whatever
the concrete ﬂow ﬁeld in the Earth might be, it is not a
surprise that the resulting dynamo is prone to reversals.

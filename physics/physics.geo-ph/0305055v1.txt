characteristic-earthquake occurrence in a minimalist model

Using error diagrams `a la Molchan, we quantify the forecasting of characteristic-earthquake oc-
currence in a recently introduced minimalist model. A general strategy of optimization is tried out
in order to improve the simple hypothesis of quasiperiodic behaviour for the time of return of the
characteristic earthquake. This strategy consists in ﬁnding a property, related to the occurrence of
earthquakes in the cycle, that divides the probability distribution of the time of return of the char-
acteristic earthquake in two distinct distributions. These distributions should be clearly separated
in time, and both must contain a sizeable part of the total probability. Developing this idea and
combining retarding and advancing eﬀects, an improvement in the forecasts is attained.

INTRODUCTION

The earthquake process in seismic faults is a very com-
in
plex natural phenomenon that present geophysics,
spite of its considerable eﬀorts, has not yet been able to
put into a sound and satisfactory status. Certainly, for
many years and because of its paramount importance,
one of the main goals in this area has been that of earth-
quake prediction (for a recent thorough review dealing
with this issue, see Keilis-Borok, 2002, and Keilis-Borok
and Soloviev, 2002). The introduction of new concepts
coming from modern statistical physics seems to add
some light and put some order into the intrinsic com-
plexity of the lithosphere and its dynamics. Thus, for
example, references to critical phenomena, fractals, and
self-organized criticality are now found very frequently in
geophysical literature (Turcotte, 2000; Sornette, 2000).
Hopefully, this conceptual baggage will prove its useful-
ness sooner better than later.

In a spirit akin to the sandpile model of self-organized
criticality, we have recently presented a simple statistical
model of the cellular-automaton type which produces an
earthquake spectrum similar to the characteristic earth-
quake behaviour of some seismic faults (V´azquez-Prada
et al., 2002). This model is inspired by the concept of
asperity, i.e., by the presence of a particularly strong el-
ement in the system which actually controls its relax-
ation. It presents some remarkable properties, some of
which will be reviewed in Section II. The purpose of this
paper is to quantify the forecasting of the characteris-
tic earthquake occurrence in this model, using seismicity
functions, which are observable, but not stress functions
(Ben-Zion et al., 2003), which are not. In Section III, we
use the fact that in this model the characteristic earth-
quakes occur quasiperiodically to construct an error di-
agram (Molchan, 1997; Gabrielov et al., 2000; Newman
and Turcotte, 2002) based on the time elapsed since the
occurrence of the last characteristic event. This permits

a ﬁrst assessment of the degree of predictability. In Sec-
tion IV, we propose a general strategy of classiﬁcation
of the seismic cycles which, adequately exploited in this
model, allows a reﬁnement of the forecasts. Finally, in
Section V we present a discussion and conclusions.

II.

SOME PROPERTIES OF THE MODEL

In the minimalist model (V´azquez-Prada et al., 2002),
a one-dimensional vertical array of length N is consid-
ered. The ordered levels of the array are labelled by an
integer index i that runs upwards from 1 to N . This
system performs two basic functions: it is loaded by re-
ceiving stress particles in its various levels and unloaded
by emitting groups of particles through the ﬁrst level
i = 1. These emissions that relax the system are called
earthquakes.

These two functions (loading and unloading) proceed

using the following four rules:

i in each time unit, one particle arrives at the system.

ii all the positions in the array, from i = 1 to i =
N , have the same probability of receiving the new
particle. When a position receives a particle we say
that it is occupied.

iii if a new particle comes to a level which is already
occupied, this particle disappears from the system.
Thus, a given position i can only be either non-
occupied when no particle has come to it, or oc-
cupied when one or more particles have come to
it.

iv the level i = 1 is special. When a particle goes to
this ﬁrst position a relaxation event occurs. Then,
if all the successive levels from i = 1 up to i = k
are occupied, and the position k + 1 is empty, the
eﬀect of the relaxation (or earthquake) is to unload
all the levels from i = 1 up to i = k. Hence, the
size of this relaxation is k, and the remaining levels
i > k maintain their occupancy intact.

Thus, this model has no parameter and at a given time
the state of the system is speciﬁed by stating which of
the (i > 1) N − 1 ordered levels are occupied. Each
one of these possible occupation states corresponds to a
stable conﬁguration of the system, and therefore the total
number of conﬁgurations is 2(N −1). We refer to “total
occupancy” for the conﬁguration where all the levels but
the ﬁrst are occupied. These mentioned 2(N −1) stable
conﬁgurations can be considered as the states of a ﬁnite,
irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain with a unique
stationary distribution (Durrett, 1999).

The evolution rules of the model produce an earth-
quake size-frequency relation, pk, that is shown in Fig. 1a,
where the results for N = 10, N = 100, and N = 1000
are superimposed. Note that this spectrum is of the
characteristic-earthquake type:
it exhibits a power-law
relationship for small events, an excess of maximal (char-
acteristic) events, and very few of the intermediate size.
Besides, the three superimposed curves of probability are
coincident.

The result for the probability of return of the charac-
teristic earthquake, P (n), is shown in Fig. 1b for N = 20.
Here n represents the time elapsed since the last charac-
teristic event (n ≡ ∆T ). During an initial time interval
1 ≤ n < N , P (n) is null, then it grows to a maximum
and then declines asymptotically to 0. The conﬁgurations
of the model are classiﬁed into groups according to the
number of levels, j, that are occupied (0 ≤ j ≤ N − 1).
Using the Markov-chain theory or producing simulations
(V´azquez-Prada et al., 2002), one easily observes that in
this model the system resides most of the time in the con-
ﬁgurations of maximum occupancy, i. e., in j = N − 2
and in j = N − 1.

This last property can be observed in Fig. 1c, where
we have represented, for N = 100, the time evolution
of the level of occupancy, j, in an interval long enough
to observe the occurrence of several characteristic earth-
quakes. The typical pattern after a total depletion is
a gradual recovery of j up to a new high level of oc-
cupancy. Once there, the system typically presents a
plateau before the next characteristic earthquake. Es-
pecially during the ascending recoveries, the level of oc-
cupancy j suﬀers small falls corresponding to the occur-
rence of rather small earthquakes, that in this model are
abundant. Of course, one also observes that occasionally
j falls in a signiﬁcant way corresponding to the occur-
rence of a N > k ≥ N/2 intermediate earthquake. Thus,
in this model, the N − 1 conﬁgurations corresponding to
j = N − 2, plus the unique conﬁguration corresponding
to j = N − 1 form a set of N conﬁgurations where the
system often resides and which confers to the model a
slight fragrance of the intermittent self-organized critical
type (Jensen, 1998).

ERROR DIAGRAM FOR THE

FORECASTING OF THE CHARACTERISTIC
EARTHQUAKE

The ﬁrst conclusion one draws from Fig. 1 is that the
occurrence of the characteristic earthquake in this model
is quasiperiodic. In fact, the function P (n) (Fig. 1b) has
a well deﬁned mean

∞

X
n=1

n P (n) =< n > .

(1)

This mean, < n > , is expressed in the Markov chain

formalism (Durrett, 1999) as

< n >=

N
a(N −1)

,

(2)

where a(N −1) is the stationary probability of the conﬁg-
uration j = N − 1 (V´azquez-Prada et al., 2002).

In the following paragraphs, we will stick to a model of
size N = 20 to make the pertinent comparisons. This size
is big enough for our purposes here, and small enough to
obtain good statistics in the simulations. For N = 20,
< n >= 121.05.

A quantitative measure of the success of a forecasting
algorithm is shown in the so-called error diagrams, intro-
duced in earthquake forecasting by Molchan (Molchan,
1997). As in any optimization strategy, one tries to
achieve simultaneously the most in a property called A
and the least in a property called B, these two purposes
being contradictory in themselves. Here A is the (success-
ful) forecast of the characteristic earthquakes produced
in the system. Our desire is to forecast as many as possi-
ble, or ideally, all of them. B is the total amount of time
that the earthquake alarm is switched on during the fore-
casting process. As is obvious, our desire would be that
this time were a minimum. The maximization of A is
equivalent to the minimization of an A′ that represents
the fraction of unsuccessful forecasts.

Thus, in practice, our goal is to obtain simultaneously
a minimum value for the two following functions, fe(n)
and fa(n). The ﬁrst represents the fraction of unsuccess-
ful forecasts, or fraction of failures; the second represents
the fraction of alarm time. These two functions are de-
pendent on the value of n, that is, the time elapsed since
the last main event, and to which the alarm is connected.
Using the function P (n) previously deﬁned, they read as
follows:

They are plotted in Fig. 2a. By eliminating n between
fe(n) and fa(n), we obtain Fig. 2b, which is the standard
form of representing the error diagram. The diagonal
straight line would represent the result coming from a
pure Poisson process. The curved line is the result of this
model. In the two ﬁgures 2a, and 2b, the star (⋆) marks
the position of n = 121 (fe(121) = 0.5780, fa(121) =
0.1666). As n = 121 is the mean value of the return
time of the characteristic earthquake, this would be the
natural time to connect the alarm, in the case of not
using any reﬁnement in the forecasts.

IV.

TENTATIVE IMPROVING OF THE

FORECASTS

We deﬁne a medium-size earthquake as an event with
a size between N/2 and N − 1, i.e. N > k ≥ N/2. By ob-
serving the graphs in Fig. 1, one is led to the conclusion
that in this model the occurrence of a medium-size earth-
quake is not frequent but when it actually takes place,
the time of return of the characteristic quake in that cy-
cle is increased (compare, for example, the duration of
the second and the third cycles in 1c).

This qualitative perception can be substantiated by
numerically obtaining the probability of having cycles
where no medium-size earthquake occurs, i.e., k < N/2.
This information is completed by the distribution of cy-
cles where the condition N > k ≥ N/2 does occur. These
two distributions are shown in Fig. 3a as lines b and
c. Here, line a represents the total distribution of the
times of return of the characteristic earthquake in this
model (the same as plotted in Fig. 1b). Note that, as it
should, the distribution a covers both distributions b and
c. The mean time < n > for the three distributions is
< n >a= 121.05, < n >b= 107.57 and < n >c= 166.84.
The fraction of cycles under b is 0.77 and the fraction
under c is 0.23.

Now we look for a similar property that can classify
the cycles from another point of view. This new prop-
erty consists in identifying the cycles where in the ﬁrst
80 time steps after a characteristic earthquake, the sum
of the sizes of all the earthquakes is at most 9. This
condition will be represented by SU M ≤ 9. Underlying
this strategy is the fact that if SU M ≤ 9 at n = 80, the
system will likely be already in the plateau mentioned in
Section II, and thus the occurrence of a main event is im-
pending. In qualitative terms, the condition SU M ≤ 9 is
used here as a premonitory signal. In Fig. 3b, line a rep-
resents, as in Fig. 3a, the distribution of return intervals
of the characteristic earthquake for all the cycles of the
model. And lines f and g represent the separation of line
a according to the fulﬁlment, or not, of the SU M ≤ 9
condition. The mean value of the f and g distributions
is < n >f = 80.03 and < n >g= 128.42 respectively. The
fraction of events under the f and g lines is 0.15 and 0.85
respectively.

Finally, also in Fig. 3c, we show the splitting of the
b distribution (cycles with no medium-size earthquakes)
according to the SU M ≤ 9 condition. The result is the
separation of b into d and e. Thus, d represents the dis-
tribution of cycles where no intermediate earthquake oc-
curs and where the condition SU M ≤ 9 is not fulﬁlled.
Its mean is < n >d= 114.69 , and it constitutes a frac-
tion 0.62 of the total. The e distribution is formed by
those cycles without intermediate events and which fulﬁl
SU M ≤ 9. Its mean is < n >e= 78.06, and it constitutes
a fraction 0.15 of the total. We have not shown in Fig. 3
the splitting of curve c (cycles with at least one medium-
size earthquake) according to the condition SU M ≤ 9
because most of the cycles that have medium-size events

Curves b and c constitute the splitting of curve a according

are typically of the SU M > 9 type. This type of cycles,
denoted by c′, have a mean of < n >c′= 166.41 and their
fraction of probability amount is 0.20. The fraction of
cycles, that belong to c and do not belong to c′ are de-
noted by the letter o, < n >o= 199.73 and their fraction
is only 0.03 of the total.

The observed separation of the a distribution into b
and c suggests a possible way to improve the simple fore-
casting method discussed in Section III. Thus, adopting
the role of a forecasting ﬁeld operator, we will follow, in
real time, the running simulation of our model. Our de-
cisions will be based exclusively on the number and size
of the earthquakes occurring during the simulation. In a
ﬁrst instance, we will take < n >= 108 (∼=< nb >) as the
reference interval, and not the former 121 (∼=< nc >);
and in the case of occurrence of a medium-size earth-
quake, then we will postpone the alarm until n = 167.
The result of this simple strategy is the point marked
with a star in Fig. 4. This point, that results from this
pure retarding strategy has the coordinates fe = 0.6638
and fa = 0.1133 in the error diagram.

Compared with the simple forecasting strategy of Sec-
tion III (ﬁlled circle in Fig. 4), we have reduced fa, the
fraction of time the alarm is on; but we have at the
same time increased the percentage of failures to predict
a characteristic earthquake. Other valuable information
is that expressed in Fig. 3b, with the splitting of a into
f and g. The rounded mean values of these curves are
80 for curve f and 128 for curve g. The wide separation
between these means justiﬁes the use of the advancing
strategy that will be developed in the next paragraphs.
Thus, we propose a combined strategy intended to ob-
tain a simultaneous reduction in fe and fa. It is based
in the separations of a into b and c, of b into d and e and
of c into c′ and o, i.e., in this strategy, the alarms will
be connected or not, depending on the fulﬁllment of the
conditions marked by these separations. As the rounded
means are: < n >e= 78, < n >d= 115, < n >c′= 166
and < n >o= 199, we have used in this combined strat-
egy the following steps:

i if at n = 78, SU M ≤ 9 is fulﬁlled, and no interme-
diate event has occurred, then the alarm is put at
n = 78.

ii if at n = 78, SU M ≤ 9 is not fulﬁlled, and no
intermediate event has occurred for n ≤ 115, then
the alarm is put at n = 115.

iii if at n = 78, SU M ≤ 9 is not fulﬁlled, and an
intermediate event has occurred for n ≤ 115, then
the alarm is put at n = 166.

iv if at n = 78, SU M ≤ 9 is fulﬁlled, and an inter-
mediate event has occurred for n ≤ 115, then the
alarm is put at n = 199.

v and, as in any strategy, when a characteristic earth-
quake has taken place, if it has been a successful
forecast it is inscribed as a success and the time

DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have analyzed the behaviour of the
minimalist model in relation to a quantitative assessment
of the forecasting of its successive characteristic earth-
quakes. This has been expressed in the so-called error
diagram. Our results have been certainly modest but
our purpose was not so much to obtain the best possi-
ble result in the forecasting, but to put in evidence that
any bit of extra information acquired in the model, al-
lows an improvement in the predictions. As expected,
the improvement of the forecasts with respect to the re-
sults derived from the simple quasiperiodic hypothesis
has proven itself (in this model) as a tough challenge.

We have explored two modes of a common strategy
with the aim of improving the forecasts. The ﬁrst mode
(retarding strategy) consists in using the occurrence of
intermediate-magnitude earthquakes as a sign that in
that cycle the characteristic earthquake would likely re-
turn at a time longer than usual. This is based on the fact
that medium-size events signiﬁcantly deplete the load in
the system and its recovery induces a retardation. The
second mode (advancing strategy) consists in considering
that a signiﬁcant absence of small earthquakes during a

sizeable lapse of time is a sign of inminence of the next
characteristic event, or at least of a shortening of its pe-
riod of return. This strategy is similar to the concept of
“seismic gap”, an old wisdom in seismology that links a
steady absence of earthquakes in a fault with the increase
in the risk of occurrence of a big event.

The numbers resulting from the application of these
strategies are shown in Fig. 4. The point represented by
the ﬁlled circle corresponds to n = 121. As said in Sec-
tion III, this is the mean value of P (n), and therefore this
point is marked as a reference. The point marked with a
star (⋆) represents the eﬀect of the retarding strategy. As
typically occurs with any option that retards the switch-
ing on of the alarm, it leads to a reduction in fa and to
an increase in fe. The simultaneous use of the retarding
and advancing strategies, leads to point marked with a
diamond ((cid:7)). It shows that our mixing recipe produces
a fair result.

The ultimate reason for not obtaining clearly good im-
provements in the forecasting is due to the fact that in
all the splittings shown in Fig. 3, the resulting curves
have a signiﬁcant degree of overlapping. Reducing the
overlapping would, for sure, render better results.

6

It is important to remark that the information we have
used in our forecasts is based only in the observed sys-
tematics of earthquake occurrence in the model, i.e., only
seismicity functions have been used. Thus, for example,
in Section IV we have not used the state of occupancy of
the system j, which would have given much more accu-
rate predictions. In real life, the use of this information
would be equivalent to knowing, in real time, the value
of the stress level and the failure threshold at any point
in a fault.

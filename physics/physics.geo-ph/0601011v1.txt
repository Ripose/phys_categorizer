The irregular polarity reversals of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld have attracted much interest during
the last decades. Despite the fact that recent numerical simulations of the geodynamo have shown
nice polarity transitions, the very reason and the basic mechanism of reversals are far from being
understood. Using a paradigmatic mean-ﬁeld dynamo model with a spherically symmetric helical
turbulence parameter α we attribute the essential features of reversals to the magnetic ﬁeld dynamics
in the vicinity of an exceptional point of the spectrum of the non-selfadjoint dynamo operator. At
such exceptional (branch) points of square root type two real eigenvalues coalesce and continue as
a complex conjugated pair of eigenvalues. Special focus is laid on the comparison of numerically
computed time series with paleomagnetic observations.
It is shown that the considered dynamo
model with high supercriticality can explain the observed time scale and the asymmetric shape of
reversals with a slow decay and a fast ﬁeld recovery.

Introduction.

There is ample paleomagnetic evidence that the axial dipole component of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld has reversed its
polarity many times. The last reversal, the Brunhes-Matuyama transition, occurred approximately 780000 years ago.
The mean rate of reversals varies from nearly zero during the Kiaman and Cretaceous superchrons to approximately
5 per Myr in the present. Some observations suggest a pronounced asymmetry of reversals with the decay of the
dipole of a given polarity being much slower than the following recreation of the dipole with opposite polarity [1, 2].
Observational data also indicate a possible correlation of the ﬁeld intensity with the interval between subsequent
reversals [2, 3]. A third hypothesis concerns the bimodal distribution of the Earth’s virtual axial dipole moment
(VADM) with two peaks at approximately 4 × 1022 Am2 and at twice that value [4, 5, 6].

Although these reversal features are still controversially discussed in the literature, it is worthwhile to ask if and
how they could be represented within geodynamo theory. With view on the recent dynamo experiments in Riga and
Karlsruhe [7] one could also ask about the most essential ingredient for a dynamo experiment to exhibit irregular
reversals in a similar way as the geodynamo does.

In a recent paper [9] we had shown that a simple mean-ﬁeld dynamo model with a spherically symmetric helical
turbulence parameter α can exhibit all three mentioned features of reversals. Interestingly, all of them are attributable
to the magnetic ﬁeld dynamics in the vicinity of an exceptional point [8] of the spectrum of the non-selfadjoint dynamo
operator where two real eigenvalues coalesce and continue as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues. Typically, this
exceptional point is associated with a nearby local maximum of the growth rate dependence on the magnetic Reynolds
number. It is the negative slope of this curve between the local maximum and the exceptional point that makes even
stationary dynamos vulnerable to some prevailing noise. This way, the system can leave the stable state and run
towards the exceptional point and beyond into the oscillatory branch where the polarity transition occurs.

A weakness of this reversal model was the apparent necessity to ﬁne-tune the magnetic Reynolds number and/or
the radial proﬁle α(r) in order to adjust the operator spectrum in an appropriate way. In a follow-up paper [10] it
was shown, however, that this ﬁne-tuning is not necessary in the case of higher supercriticality of the dynamo. It
turned out that for increasing magnetic Reynolds number there is a strong tendency for the exceptional point and
the associated local maximum to move close to the zero growth rate line were the indicated reversal scenario can be
actualized. Although exempliﬁed by the simple spherically symmetric α2 dynamo model, the main idea of this ”self-
tuning” mechanism of saturated dynamos into a reversal-prone state seems transferable to other dynamos. Hence,
reversing dynamos might be much more typical than what could be expected from a purely kinematic perspective.

In the present paper we go one step further and compare paleomagnetic data of ﬁve reversals from the last two
It will be shown that it is again the strong
million years with numerical time series resulting from our model.
supercriticality of the considered dynamo models that may explain the typical time scales of the observed asymmetric
reversals.

FIG. 1: Magnetic ﬁeld evolution for D = 0. With higher values of C, the ﬁeld amplitude increases and the oscillation frequency
decreases. Note also the growing anharmonicity (saw-tooth shape) of the oscillations and the transition to a non-oscillatory
regime (as seen for C = 7.24).

We consider a simple mean-ﬁeld dynamo model of α2 type with a supposed spherically symmetric, isotropic helical

turbulence parameter α [11]. The induction equation for the magnetic ﬁeld B reads

I. THE MODEL.

˙B = ∇ × (αB) + (µ0σ)

−1∆B ,

with magnetic permeability µ0 and electrical conductivity σ. For the Earth’s core we will assume the diﬀusion time
τdif f = µ0σR2 to be ∼ 200 kyr.

The divergence-free magnetic ﬁeld B can be decomposed into a poloidal and a toroidal components, according to
B = −∇ × (r × ∇S) − r × ∇T . The deﬁning scalars S and T are expanded in spherical harmonics of degree l and
order m with expansion coeﬃcients sl,m(r, τ ) and tl,m(r, τ ). For the envisioned spherically symmetric and isotropic α2
dynamo problem, the induction equation decouples for each degree l and order m into the following pair of equations:

(cid:19)

Since these equations are independent of the order m, we have skipped m in the index of s and t. The boundary
conditions are ∂sl/∂r|r=1 + (l + 1)sl(1) = tl(1) = 0. In the following we consider only the dipole ﬁeld with l = 1.

We will focus on a particular radial proﬁle αkin(r) = 1.916 C (1 − 6 r2 + 5 r4), which is characterized by a sign
change along the radius (the factor 1.916 results from normalizing the radial average of |α(r)| to the corresponding
value for constant α). The motivation for this choice is that quite similar α(r) proﬁles had been shown to exhibit
oscillatory behaviour [12].

Saturation is ensured by assuming the kinematic proﬁle αkin(r) to be algebraically quenched by the magnetic ﬁeld
energy averaged over the angles which can be expressed in terms of s1(r, τ ) and t1(r, τ ). Note that this averaging over
the angles represents a severe simpliﬁcation, since in reality (even for an assumed spherically symmetric kinematic α)
the energy dependent quenching would result in a breaking of the spherical symmetry.

In addition to this quenching, the α(r) proﬁles are perturbed by ”blobs” of noise which are considered constant
within a correlation time τcorr. Physically, such a noise term can be understood as a consequence of changing boundary
conditions for the ﬂow in the outer core, but also as a substitute for the omitted inﬂuence of higher multipole modes
on the dominant axial dipole mode.

dynamo number, D is the noise strength, and Emag,0 is a constant measuring the mean magnetic ﬁeld energy.

II. NUMERICAL RESULTS.

We start with the noise-free case. Figure 1 shows the magnetic ﬁeld evolution according to the equation system (2-4)
for D = 0 and diﬀerent dynamo numbers C. The critical dynamo number is 6.78. The nearly harmonic oscillation
for C = 6.8 becomes more and more saw-tooth shaped for increasing C, with a pronounced asymmetry between the
slow ﬁeld decay and the fast ﬁeld recreation during the reversal. At C = 7.24 a transition to a steady dynamo has
occurred.

In order to understand this behaviour, we examine in Fig. 2 the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld within approximately
half a period of the anharmonic oscillation for the particular value C = 7.237 at which the saw-tooth shape is already
very pronounced. Figure 2a shows the time dependence of s(r = 1) during this half period, with the typical slow
decay and the fast recreation of the ﬁeld. This behaviour is analyzed in detail at 9 selected instants τi (i = 1...9) for
which the instantaneous ﬁelds s(r, τi) (Fig. 2d) and the corresponding α(r, τi) (Fig. 2e, 2f) are depicted. The latter
two plots reveal that α(r) undergoes only slight changes during the oscillation and that it comes very close to the
unquenched, kinematic αkin(r) (denoted by K) when the magnetic ﬁeld is small in the middle of the reversal.

It is instructive to plug the instantaneous α(r, τi) proﬁles into an eigenvalue solver (for which the time derivatives
on the left hand sides of Eqs. (2) and (3) are replaced by λs(r) and λt(r), respectively). Figure 2b and Fig. 2c show

proﬁle and for the quenched α(r, τi) proﬁles. The Ei indicate, for each of the considered α proﬁles, the exceptional point. (b)
Growth rates for the proﬁles α(r) = 1.916 C ∗ C (1 − 6 r2 + 5 r4)/(1 + Emag(r)/Emag,0) with C =6.78, 7.2, 10, 20, 50, 100,

point well above the zero line and back to it (indicated by the thick dashed line).

the resulting instantaneous growth rates and frequencies during the half-oscillation. Evidently, the reversal starts
with a very slow ﬁeld decay (slightly negative growth rate) which, however, accelerates itself and drives the system
into an oscillatory behaviour (the frequency becomes diﬀerent from zero for 2.0 < τ < 4.5). Around τ = 4, when the
quenching of α is weak, the instantaneous growth rate reaches rather high values. Later we will see that for strongly
supercritical dynamos these high growth rates result in a ﬁeld dynamics that is much faster than what would be
expected from the diﬀusion time scale.

In Figure 3a we relate this magnetic ﬁeld evolution to the existence of exceptional points of the spectrum. It shows
the instantaneous growth rate which results from the individual α(r, τi) proﬁles, and from the unquenched (kinematic)
α(r) proﬁle K. In addition to the growth rates at the actual dynamo number C = 7.237 (indicated by the dashed
vertical line), we have plotted the whole growth rate curves in the interval between 4.5 < C < 7.5. At the exceptional
point Ek of the kinematic αkin(r), the ﬁrst eigenvalue branch K1 coalesces with the second branch K2 and both
continue as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues. For all other curves, only the exceptional point is indicated by
Ei whereas the branch of the second eigenvalue has been omitted. In this framework, a reversal can be described
as follows: At the instant 1, the growth rate is located close to the maximum of the non-oscillatory branch which is
slightly below zero. The resulting slow ﬁeld decay accelerates itself, because the system moves down (instant 2) from
the maximum of the real branch towards the exceptional point. Then the system enters the oscillatory branch (3-7).
Finally the system moves back again (8,9) but with opposite polarity.

The transition point between oscillatory and steady dynamos (C = 7.239) is characterized by the fact that the
maximum of the non-oscillatory branch crosses the zero growth rate line. Beyond this point, the ﬁeld is growing
rather than decaying, leading to a stable ﬁxed point somewhere to the left of the maximum of the non-oscillatory
branch, and hence to a non-oscillatory dynamo (cf. the case C = 7.24 in Fig. 1). If noise comes into play it will soften
the sharp border between oscillatory and steady dynamos. This means, in particular, that even above the transition
point, the noise can trigger a jump to the right of the maximum from were the described reversal process can start
(Fig. 2).

Having identiﬁed the exceptional point and the nearby local maximum as the spectral features that are responsible
for both the slow decay before and the fast recreation of the ﬁeld after the polarity transition, one may ask now why
the operator of the actual geodynamo should possess just such a special spectrum.

A preliminary answer to this question was given in [10] and is illustrated in Fig. 3b. Roughly speaking, highly
supercritical dynamos seem to have a tendency to saturate in a state for which the exceptional point and its associated
local maximum lie close to the zero growth rate line.
Interestingly, this happens independently on whether the
exceptional point in the original kinematic case was above the zero growth rate line or below it. Our example with
αkin(r) = 1.916 C (1 − 6 r2 + 5 r4) belongs to the second type. Starting from the kinematic αkin(r), for which the
exceptional point is well below the zero line, it rises rapidly above zero to a maximum value, but for even higher C it
moves back in direction to the zero line.

FIG. 4: Time series for some selected values of C and D.

Without noise and for C > 7.239, the position of the local maximum above the zero growth rate line leads to a
steady dynamo. The presence of noise will sometimes bring the actual growth rate below zero, and then the indicated
reversal process can start. A number of time series for diﬀerent values of C and D is depicted in Fig. 4.

Figure 5 shows reversal details for four particular choices of C and D. For later comparison with paleomagnetic
data we have exhibited ﬁve typical reversals, and their averages, from 80 kyr before the polarity transition until 20
kyr after (except the case C = 8, D = 1 for which the reversal takes much longer).

III. COMPARISON WITH PALEOMAGNETIC DATA.

In this section we will validate if our model can be ﬁtted to real paleomagnetic data. For this purpose we have
used recently published material about ﬁve reversals which occurred during the last two million years [2]. Actually,
the data shown in Fig. 6a have been extracted from Fig. 4 of [2]. In all ﬁve curves, as well as in their averages, the
asymmetry of the reversal process is clearly visible. The dominant features are a ﬁeld decay over a period of 50-80 kyr
and a rather sharp ﬁeld recreation within 5-10 kyr. It has been an old-standing puzzle to explain in particular this
fast recreation when a diﬀusive timescale of 200 kyr has to be taken into account. A possible solution of this problem
is to assume a turbulent resistivity which is much larger than the molecular resistivity (e.g., by a factor 15-20 in [13]).
The comparison of the real data with the numerically time series in Fig. 6b shows that this assumption of turbulent
resistivity is by no means necessary. Apart from the slightly supercritical case C = 8, D = 1 which exhibits a much
to slow magnetic ﬁeld evolution, the other examples with C =20, 50, 100 and D = 6 show very realistic time series

with the typical slow decay and fast recreation. As noted above, the fast recreation results from the fact that in a
small intervall during the transition the dynamo operates with an nearly unquenched α(r) proﬁles which yields, in
case that the dynamo is strongly supercritical, rather high growth rates.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Based on former results in [9] and [10], we have shown that a simple but strongly supercritical α2 dynamo model
exhibits a number of features which are typical for Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld reversals, in particular an asymmetric shape
and correct timescales for the ﬁeld decay and ﬁeld recreation.

As it does not include the necessary North-South asymmetry of α we cannot claim that our model is an appropriate
model of the geodynamo. However, recent papers by Giesecke et al. have shown that a) even in such realistic models α
may exhibit a sign change along the radius [14] and b) that such models can also give rise to reversals [15]. Therefore,
it seems worthwhile to identify the indicated reversal scenario in this and in more complicated geodynamo models.

Abstract

We develop the formalism for a PIM-based functional for stochastic tomography

with a Kalman ﬁlter, in which the inversion problem associated with four-dimensional

ionospheric stochastic tomography is regularized. For consistency, GPS data is used to

select dynamically the best PIM parameters, in a 3DVAR fashion. We demonstrate the

ingestion of GPS (IGS and GPS/MET) data into a parameterized ionospheric model,

used to select the set of parameters that minimize a suitable cost functional. The

resulting PIM-ﬁtted model is compared to direct 3D voxel tomography. We demonstrate

the value of this method analyzing IGS and GPS/MET GPS data, and present our

results in terms of a 4D model of the ionospheric electronic density.

1 Introduction

IN previous work [1, 2, 3], we analyzed GPS data to extract information about the ionospheric

electron density distribution. We can think of this distribution as a ﬁeld in space-time which we

try to represent using the information provided by the data. Since the ionosphere produces delays

in the phase and group propagation of radio waves, having an accurate description of the electron

content in the ionosphere is essential to any endeavor that uses radio wave propagation (such as

tracking and navigating). In this paper we describe a novel parameterized tomographic technique

to perform ionospheric imaging using Global Positioning System signal delay information.

Climatological models of the ionosphere have existed for a while now, but it is only recently that

they have been used to complement other sources of data, such as GPS, in the inversion process. For

instance, one can use input from a climatological model such as PIM [5] to complement GPS data in

the inversion process, and to compare the results to other data [4]. The parameters controlling the

model are input directly, however, and are not estimated themselves. One could reason, however,

that if the models were good enough they could used to infer these parameters given other sources

of data, such as GPS ionospheric delay data. The resulting “best-ﬁt” parameters should be related

to the ones one can obtain by independent means.

Let us give a brief introduction to ionospheric tomography (more details can be found in [1, 2, 3]).

Let ρ(r, θ, φ, t) be the function that describes the electron density in some region of space (r, θ, φ

are spherical coordinates) at some time t. We can rewrite it as

ρ(r, θ, φ, t) =

aJ (t) ΨJ (r, θ, φ),

XJ

where the functions ΨJ (r, θ, φ) can be any set of basis functions we like. The goal in the inverse

problem is to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients aJ (t). In the case of GPS ionospheric tomography we use the

information provided by the GPS ionospheric delay data along the satellite-receiver rays li to obtain

a set of equations,

XJ
one for each ray li. Here yi is the observed quantity. This is a set of linear equations of the

form A x = y, where the components of the vector x are the unknown coeﬃcients aJ (t). Assume

that some cut-oﬀ in the basis function expansion is used and, therefore, that the x-space is N-

dimensional. Let the y-space be M-dimensional (M is thus the number of data points). Since
this system of equations may not have a solution we seek to minimize the functional χ2(x), where

(assuming uncorrelated observations of equal variance)

(3)

χ2(x) = (y − A x)T · (y − A x).

In practice we ﬁnd that although the number of equations is much greater than the number of

unknowns, the unknowns, i.e., the array x, are not completely ﬁxed by the data. A way to restrict

the solution space is to add some a priori constraints to the problem, and this can be implemented

using the Lagrange multiplier method. Here we propose using a climatological model, such as PIM,

to ﬁll the gaps in the data and “smooth” the solution. But in order to use a climatological model

one must provide the necessary input parameters. It is certainly possible to use for these parameters

values provided by experimental sources of data (e.g., the solar ﬂux is a measurable quantity). As

was mentioned above, such techniques have already been used [4]. But another way to proceed is

to use the GPS data itself, together with the model, to ﬁx these parameters. This is especially

important if it is suspected that the model parameters are not truly physical. If nothing else, this

is an interesting exercise that will test the validity of the model.

A climatological mode, such as PIM, maps the value of a set of parameters, λi, to the space {x}.

Just as is done in variational weather modeling, we can picture minimizing the cost functional

J(λi) =

Oexp

j − O[x(λi)]j

,

(cid:17)

where Oexp

are the observables and O[x(λi)]j the modeled observables, in our case the slant delays

produced by the ionospheric electrons. If we think of the climatological model image as the space

spanned by a set of empirical orthogonal functions (which is the case in PIM), we see that this

approach is just as the one described before, in the sense that a ﬁnite basis set is used to ﬁt

the data and represent the solution. What a model like PIM does is to provide us with a set of

empirically or theoretically optimized basis functions to represent the ionospheric electron content.

2 PIM-aided Kalman Filtering

Kalman ﬁltering is a very useful technique when dealing with a dynamic process in which data

is available at diﬀerent times.

It is a natural way to enforce smoothness under time evolution,

and is especially useful in the case of ionospheric stochastic tomography, when the “holes” in

the information that we have at a given time (because of the particular spatial distribution of

the GPS constellation and the receptor grid) may be “plugged” by the data from previous and

future measurements. Indeed, in a Kalman ﬁlter we use the information contained in a solution to

the inversion problem to estimate the next solution in the iteration process. In the study of the

ionosphere, for example, we break the continuous ﬂow of satellite delay data into blocks of a few

hours, and simply model ionospheric dynamics by a random walk [7]. We can then process the data

at a given point in the iteration by asking that, to some extent, the solution be similar to the one

in the previous iteration, depending on how much conﬁdence we have in that previous solution, and

on how much we expect the dynamics to have changed things from one solution to the next. Here

we complement this step by using the previous solution in the iteration process to ﬁt a PIM model

to the data. In other words, if xn and Cn are the solution and the covariance matrix at epoch n,

we ﬁrst determine a minimum squares PIM ﬁt. Let A be the observation matrix (which we know

how to compute, given a grid). Then we minimize the cost functional

J(λ) =

y − A · xP IM (λ)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and this will determine the PIM parameters λi, and the resulting image, xP IM

We will not worry too much about it for now, since it may be hard to compute these PIM derivatives.

We will instead use an ad hoc covariance matrix, with the property that it will ﬁll the holes in the

data without aﬀecting too much the solution where the data already provides some information (as

mography

Let us ﬁrst summarize our goals:

• To demonstrate the ingestion of GPS (IGS and GPS/MET) data into a parameterized iono-

spheric model, and to select the set of parameters that minimize a suitable cost functional.

• To compare the model ﬁt to direct 3D voxel tomography.

• To develop a PIM-based functional for stochastic tomography with a Kalman ﬁlter, in which

the inversion problem associated with four-dimensional ionospheric stochastic tomography is

regularized. For consistency, GPS data is used to select dynamically the best PIM parameters,

in a 3DVAR fashion.

GPS observables consist essentially of the delays experienced by the dual frequency signals (f1 =1.57542

GHz and f2 =1.22760 GHz) transmitted from the GPS constellation (25 satellites) and received at

GPS receivers around the world and in orbit. Let Li be the measured total ﬂight time in light-meters

of a ray going from a given GPS satellite to a receiver at the frequency fi (including instrumental

biases), and I =
meter). Then Li is modeled by Li = D − I α/f 2

ray dl ρ(x) be the integrated electron density along the ray (in electrons per square
R
i + ˜csat + ˜crec, where α = 40.3 m3/s2, D is the length
of the ray, and ˜csat and ˜crec are the instrumental biases. In the present case we are interested in the

frequency dependent part of the delay: L = L1 − L2 (in meters). This is the derived observable and
is modeled by (γ = 1.05 ×10−17 m3) L = γ I + csat + crec, independent of D (see [2] for more details).

For the purposes of PIM-ﬁtting, the solutions for the bias constants from the previous iteration are

used to “ﬁx” the observables delays, so that only the electronic part of the delay remains. At this

point we have not tried to estimate the bias constants within the PIM-ﬁtting analysis, although

this should be possible. See the Appendix A for details on our bias constant treatment.

GPS data has been collected from GPS/MET and a subset of the International GPS Service

(IGS) Network, for the day of February 23rd of 1997. This particular day has been chosen because

of A/S is known to have been oﬀ. Geomagnetic and solar activity indices (as distributed by the US

National Geophysical Data Center) for that day indicate a mean Kp index of 2.3, and F10.7 = 73.

The raw data has been pre-processed in order to obtain the observables using the procedures

described in [2]. To describe the ionosphere we use ﬁve geocentric spherical layers beginning at 50

km above the mean surface (6350 km) of the Earth and extending 1300 km. Each layer consists

then of two hundred voxels of dimensions 18o in latitude, times 18o in longitude, times 150 km of

height for the ﬁrst 4 layers.

The unknowns here consist of the electron densities at each of these voxels, plus the unknowns

corresponding to the transmitter and receiver constant delays. These are estimated and used to

correct the data prior to PIM-ﬁtting. For a particular block, a minimum was found at F10.7 = 52

and Kp = 0. Thus, we see that these parameters should not be taken as physical quantities but

just as parameters in the model. The PIM ﬁt had a reasonable quality (40 cm standard deviation).

Using the parameters estimated form observation (F10.7 = 73 and Kp = 2.3) yields a standard

deviation of 45 cm (they are far from the minimum). This is expected, as it is known that PIM

tends to overestimate TECs (Rob Daniell, private communication).

4 Summary, Conclusions

In this paper we have summarized our eﬀorts to use climatological models in tomographic analysis of

GPS data. This is a more natural thing to try than one may think at ﬁrst. After all, climatological

models such as PIM are essentially the result of performing Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis

using empirical or theoretical data, and in a way this is exactly what one would like to do in

tomography: the basis functions used to span the space of possible solutions should be adapted to

the ﬁeld one is trying to map. Basis sets such as wavelets are a step in this direction, but they are

optimized to attack more general problems, where certain characteristics of the ﬁeld one is studying

are known. Here we can reﬁne the basis set even more, given the theoretical and experimental

knowledge that we already posses about the ionosphere. We have seen that the parameters in the

model are not really physical, and we conclude that it is necessary to perform such parameter ﬁts

prior using the model estimates in the Kalman ﬁlter. Future eﬀorts should be directed towards the

development of more reﬁned parameterized models. The ingestion of GPS data into this type of

model has been demonstrated here.

Appendix A

Here we show how to take out the constants from the analysis. Let x denote the array solution, in

which the ﬁrst n entries correspond to the voxel unknowns, and thereafter to the bias constants.

Let us rewrite x = xvox + xc, where xvox is an array with zeros after the nth entry, and xc has zeros

until after the nth entry. Now,

χ2(x) = (y − A x)T · (y − A x)

= yT y + xT

Hence, if we wish to ﬁx xc, all that is needed is to modify AT y → AT (y − Axc) =
, and
proceed without estimating the constants. Since xvox is an array with zeros after the nth entry,

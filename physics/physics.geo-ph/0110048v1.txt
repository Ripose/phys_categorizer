Abstract. We discuss the question as to how the magnetospheric energy source feeds
the ionospheric current system.
It is shown that a consistent application and further
development of Kennel’s ideas makes it possible to successfully solve the magnetosphere-
ionosphere coupling problem in regard to the formation of auroral electrojets by steady
volume currents generated in the magnetosphere by the magnetospheric MHD generator
in the case of a simple model which, nevertheless, retains the essential features of the
reality. It is concluded that the whole of the complicated magnetospheric ”design” only
acts to redistribute, in space and time, currents and energy ﬂuxes which must be supplied
by external sources to feed the dissipative processes in the ionosphere.

1 INTRODUCTION

The resumes of the last two international conferences [Kamide, 1998; Lui, 2000] distinctly
voiced a faint note of dissatisfaction with the lack of progress toward an understanding
of the physical essence of magnetospheric processes and, above all, the magnetospheric

1

substorm. In our opinion, to speak in plain terms, things are reaching a conceptual crisis.
Four decades ago, two concepts of solar wind (SW)-magnetosphere coupling were formu-
lated: the concept of quasi-viscous interaction [Axford and Hines, 1961], and the concept
of magnetic ﬁeld line reconnection [Dungey, 1961]. The concepts are both based on the
assumption that in the region of SW-magnetosphere interaction there exist meaningful
transport coeﬃcients: a certain eﬀective viscosity and eﬀective conductivity in the former
and latter cases, respectively. These coeﬃcients are both proportional to a certain length
having the meaning of the free path length of particles in the case of paired collisions.
Since the free path length of particles in the magnetosphere at paired collisions involving
Coulomb interaction is far in excess of the dimensions of the magnetosphere, magneto-
spheric plasma is said to be collisionless. However, plasma can sustain collective processes
leading to exchanges of momentum and energy between particles. The exchange proceeds
through waves which must have a spectral energy density large enough for a suﬃcient
exchange rate to be ensured (quasi-collisional mode). Thus the validity of both concepts
boils down to the problem of ﬁnding out such plasma instabilities which would be capable
of ensuring the quasi-collisional regime. This problem has not been solved yet, and hence
groundwork is lacking for both concepts of energy transfer from the solar wind to the
magnetosphere. Still this does not seem to be the main reason behind the crisis. The re-
quired instabilities may well be found. Moreover, recently V.V.Mishin [Mishin, 2001] was
able to demonstrate that when supersonic magnetosheeth plasma ﬂows round the magne-
topause, the shear ﬂow generates oblique magnetosonic waves penetrating deep into the
magnetosphere and carrying their momentum along. This process proved to be suﬃciently
eﬀective, so it must be taken into account in the energy budget of the magnetosphere. The
chief reason, however, is that neither of the two concepts failed to serve as an appropriate
foundation for constructing a sequence of physical mechanisms which would lead us from
the processes in the bow shock to the processes of auroral electrojet formation.
To ﬁnd a way out of the impasse implies adopting a new concept based on the well-
known Kennel’s paper entitled ”Consequences of magnetospheric plasma” [Kennel, 1969].
The essentials of this concept may be summarized as follows. The combined action of
convection and pitch-angle diﬀusion leads to the formation in the magnetosphere of a spa-
tial distribution of gas pressure, that is, steady volume currents. The divergence of this
volume currents brings about a spatial distribution of ﬁeld- aligned currents, i.e. magneto-
spheric sources of ionospheric current systems. Such approach oﬀers, among other things,
a ”totally gratuitous” explanation (and adequate description!) of the substorm ”breakup”
[Ponomarev, 1981]. We now consider this issue in slightly greater detail.
It is known
[Ponomarev, 1985] that the contents of the magnetic ﬂux tube (MFT) to be referred to
as the plasma tube (PT) throughout the text, transfers from one MFT to another in the

2

convection process without surplus and deﬁciency in the case where the ﬁeld lines of the
magnetic ﬂux tube are equipotential ones. This idealization is quite realistic everywhere
apart from polar auroras.
Then, as the PT drifting toward the Earth in a dipole ﬁeld, its volume decreases in pro-
portion to L−4, and the situation is the reverse for density, while pressure increases in
proportion to ∼ L
3 . However, the process of adiabatic compression is attended by the
processes of PT depletion due to pitch-angle diﬀusion into the loss cone. This process
is described by the factor ∼ exp(−
τ ) = exp(−
rdv
vϑτ ). Thus gas
pressure has a maximum on each line of convection. In accordance with the equation for
pg [Ponomarev, 1985], we have:

Here pg is gas pressure, L is the L-coordinate, r = LRe is the distance to the Earth (Re
being the Earth’s radius), Vr and Vϑ are the radial and azimuthal components of the
convection velocity of the equatorial trace of the plasma tube, respectively, and τ is the
characteristic time of PT depletion due to pitch-angle diﬀusion. The initial pressure at
a certain boundary L∞ was considered time-independent in [Kennel, 1969]. For reasons
unknown, Kennel did not extended his model to the unsteady-state case. This was done
by one of us in [Ponomarev, 1981; Ponomarev, 1985; Anistratenko and Ponomarev, 1981].
A typical gas pressure pattern that results through the combined action of convection and
loses, is depicted in Fig. 1a. It has the form of an amphitheater with a clearly pronounced
maximum near the midnight meridian, and with a sharp earthward ”break”. This ”break”
received the name ”Inner Edge of the Plasma Sheet”, IEPS.
The projection of the ”amphitheater” onto the ground corresponds to the form and position
of the auroral oval. This projection, like the real oval, executes a motion with a change
of the convection electric ﬁeld, and expands with an enhancement of the ﬁeld.
In this
process the amplitude at a maximum increases as the IEPS approaches the Earth. Next
we consider the case where the boundary conditions in (1) are time-dependent. Let the
pressure on the boundary be increased by, say, a factor of two. This ”impulse” will
start to drift downstream with the convection velocity, with a region of double amplitude
remaining everywhere in its wake. If the ”impulse” is of short duration, then a region
”multiplied by two” of a limited size will travel downstream. The eﬀect of multiplication
of two spatially narrow signals is always small apart from the time when their maximal
coincide. An amplitude ”ﬂare” will occur then. Just this is the explanation for the
”substorm breakup”, a simple, logical corollary of the inhomogeneity of the system and

3

motion [Ponomarev, 2000].
Fig. 1b illustrates the second phase of development of the pressure pattern in the process
of a model substorm.
Based on the spatial distribution of pressure as a function of coordinates and time, we can
calculate the spatial distribution of volume currents:

The divergence (2) under steady-state conditions gives an expression for ﬁeld-aligned

current densities:

We perform the integration along a magnetic ﬁeld line of the Earth’s dipole ﬁeld from the
equator (0) to the ionosphere (l). Noteworthy is the following property of the expression
under the integral sign.
It depends on the angle of intersection of magnetic and gas
pressure contours. Within the dipole approximation pB = const are merely circles. On
the contrary, pg = const have a complex conﬁguration. The sign of current jk depends,
ultimately, on the sine sign of the angle between the normals to pressure contours. This
factor eases qualitatively analysis of the current situation.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM.

Above we have outlined the prerequisites for the solution of the magnetosphere- ionosphere
coupling (MIC) problem in the part of it concerning their relations as the source and
consumer of electric current and electric energy.
The complexity of the MIC problem implies that currents in the ionosphere are governed by
the electric ﬁeld (with conductivity speciﬁed as a parameter), and in the magnetosphere
they are determined by gas pressure gradient. There does exist a connection between
the pressure distribution and convection, albeit relatively complicated. Our intention is
to understand (by analyzing a maximum possible simple model that at the same time
retains the most important traits of reality) how consistently current is established in the
overall ionosphere-magnetosphere chain, how the magnetospheric generator of ionospheric
currents operates, and what sources of power (including those of no electromagnetic origin)
this generator uses to be at work. A partial answer to the last question has been given to
date. We have demonstrated [Ponomarev, 1981; Ponomarev, 1985] that magnetospheric

4

regions that operate like an MHD compressor where plasma is compressed under the
action of Ampere’s force [j×B]
, satisfy the condition V∇pg > 0, and regions where gas
dynamic forces acts on electromagnetic forces, i.e. regions of MHD generators, satisfy the
condition V∇pg < 0 Conversion of energy from one kind to another may be written by a
straightforward formula:

c

V∇pg = jE

(4)

It seems appropriate to employ in the analysis the region of the ”cleft” which is produced
when a plasma disturbance ﬂows against the undisturbed pressure pattern (as a result of
the unsteady-state character of boundary conditions as mentioned above). This detail of
the pattern is clearly seen in Fig. 1b. Fig. 2 shows a schematic representation of a section
of this pattern. The section of the cleft is represented by ”corridors”. One can see that
the walls of ”corridors” serve as the sources of two bands of ﬁeld-aligned currents which
direction is opposite on diﬀerent walls. On the whole, a current conﬁguration forms, which
corresponds to the Iijima-Potemra scheme [Iijima and Potemra, 1976]. Importantly, the
stream convection lines run virtually along the axis of the ”corridor”, the ”corridor” itself
is extended with respect to the ... contours at a small angle, and hence the magnetic ﬁeld
inside it is nearly homogeneous. For that reason, the precipitation parameter τ can be
considered a constant quantity.
In the model of our interest, we replace the ”corridor” itself by a rectangular channel
with perfectly conducting walls overlaid by a conducting ”cover”, the ionosphere. We
compensate for the diﬀerence in spatial scales, which is caused by the convergence of ﬁeld
lines, by a correction of parameters. The channel with a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
includes a steady ﬂow of ideal plasma with a corresponding pressure gradient. All this is
portrayed in detail in Fig. 3.

3 MODEL OF THE SECONDARY MAG-

NETOSPHERIC GENERATOR.

Let us consider the phenomena occurring in the plasma ”corridor” on the basis of a simple
model. As is evident from Fig. 2, the orientation of the ”corridor” is such that plasma ﬂows
nearly along its axis. The corridor is extended in a longitudinal direction; therefore, the
magnetic ﬁeld changes little within it. All these factors allow us to replace the ”corridor”
by a channel (extended along the axis Y) of width 2D, length L, and height H. The axis Y
will be oriented across the channel, and the axis Z along its height, as shown in Fig. 3. The

5

channel is ﬁlled with ideal plasma with pressure p0 at the inlet and p1 at the outlet. The
magnetic ﬁeld B = (0, 0, Bz) will be considered homogeneous. Plasma with the velocity
V = Vx(x) ﬂows along the axis X in a positive direction. The walls of the channel possess
inﬁnite conductivity. The ionosphere is modeled by the upper cover of thickness h with
Pedersen conductivity σ. As a consequence of the existence of a pressure gradient along
the channel, the following current ﬂows across it:

jy =

c

To this volume density of current there corresponds the surface density and a total current:

Accordingly, a total current of ionospheric load is:

The primes on the diﬀerentials signify that the integration is performed over the space of
the ionosphere. Furthermore, because of the equipotentiality of magnetic ﬁeld lines, the
electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere EI is related to the electric ﬁeld in the magnetosphere by
the relation: EI dx′ = Edx In these formulas, c is the velocity of light.
In addition to the current that closes through the ionosphere, a part of the MHD gen-
erator’s current can close through the magnetosphere, as is the case with the corridor’s
current in Fig. 2. We designate this current by index 1. Then:

It is evident from (13) that the current I1 is ”organized” by the ”principle of balance”:
all the necessary expenses of the ionosphere in current (power) are covered ﬁrst, and what
remains leaves for the geomagnetic tail region. As is evident from the ﬁgures, the current
I1 (J1) there becomes part of the dawn-dusk current. Only a part because there exists also
the dawn-dusk current JB of a diﬀerent origin. It is an external current with respect to the
magnetosphere itself. As was shown by Ponomarev et al. [2000], it is produce at the Bow
Shock (BS) front through a partial deceleration of solar wind plasma by Ampere’s force
with the involvement of this current. If the Bz-component of the Interplanetary Magnetic
Field (IMF) is less than zero, the direction of this current is such that, by closing through
the magnetospheric body, it produces there Ampere’s force capable of acting to pushing

magnetospheric plasma earthward, toward an increase of magnetic and gas pressure. Thus
the MHD compressor lie in this region (located mostly at 5 < L < 10 on the nightside, i.e.
before the gas pressure maximum, see the ﬁgures; for details see in a book by Ponomarev
[1985]. It is the gas compressed by the generator that is supplied to the MHD channel,
the operation of which we are discussing here. Unlike the channel’s region, the region
of the MHD compressor lies in the area where the plasma is driven by magnetospheric
convection to travel nearly radially to the Earth. From the balance of the gas pressure
force and Ampere’s force we have:

(cid:18)

Lc and LT are the coordinates of the end and beginning of the area of plasma compres-
sion, and Bc is the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the compressor output. Further it will be
assumed that Bc = B, that is, the MHD compressor output territorially coincides with
the MHD generator input. Since plasma requires some time to travel the distance from
the compressor input to output:

∆T =

then pressure at the MHD generator input will correspond to the earlier value of the
compressor current.
By integrating (13) over the entire length of the channel and assuming that the plasma
velocity at the output is much smaller than that at the input of the MHD generator, we
ﬁnd:

Upon substituting (15) into (16), in view of what has been said about the delay, we obtain
an important relation:

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

J1(t) − qJ1(t − ∆T ) = qJB(t − ∆T ) − Jσ(t)

8

In a steady state where there is no explicit time-dependence and q = 1:

JB = Jσ

(18)

This means that actually dissipative processes can take place in the magnetosphere only at
the expense of an external source of current (and energy). The whole of the complicated
magnetospheric ”design” only redistributes currents and energy ﬂuxes in space and time.
Overall, though, this is an obvious inference as it is expectable. The integrity of (18) in
this case implies that this is not merely a declaration now. We can point out the limits of
applicability of (18) as well as the particular processes behind the notions ”steady state”
and ”unsteady state”.
We now turn our attention to the ”cross-tail currents”. Let J1 + JB be designated by Is.
Then from (17) it follows that:

Js(t) = qJs(t − ∆T ) + [JB(t) − Jσ(t)]

Obviously, the control of the tail current Is proceeds both at the expense of a variation of
JB and at the expense of the variation of the current of ionospheric load Jσ. In a quasi-
steady situation where J −1 dJ

dt << 1,q = 1 we have:
∼ [JB − Jσ]
∆T

dJs
dt

(19)

(20)

Obviously, when JB > Jσ, the cross-tail current increases, and the magnetospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld is observed to extend into the tail. Otherwise when the ionospheric load current
exceeds the external current,dJs/dt < 0 and the tail current decreases, a ”dipolization” of
the magnetic ﬁeld occurs. The physical reason behind this is the increase in ionospheric
consumption of current because of the increase in of conductivity caused by an enhance-
ment of auroral particle precipitation.
Thus between the consumer of current and energy, on the one hand, and their ”general
supplier”, the external current, there exists a ﬂexible connection via a ”depot” repre-
sented by current J1. Fig. 4 presents the scheme of time response of currents to a change
in integral ionospheric conductivity.

4 CONCLUSION

We have shown that the consistent application of the idea put forward by Kennel [Kennel,
1969] which we further developed in [Ponomarev, 1981; Ponomarev et al., 2000], makes it

9

possible to successfully solve the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling problem as regards
the formation of auroral electrojets by volume currents generated in the magnetosphere by
a corresponding distribution of plasma pressure. It was demonstrated that magnetosphere-
ionosphere coupling mechanisms, along with the mechanisms of interaction between the
magnetospheric MHD compressor and the MHD generator, only act to eﬀect the redistri-
bution of energy and electric current which must be supplied by external sources to feed
the dissipative processes in the ionosphere Ponomarev et al. [2000] suggested a generation
mechanism for this external current at the expense of a deceleration of solar wind plasma
on the bow shock.
We have been able, for the ﬁrst time, to solve the problem of conjugacy of magneto-
spheric ”gradient” current (dependent on plasma pressure gradient but independent on
the electric ﬁeld) with ”resistive” ionospheric current dependent on the electric ﬁeld (but
independent of gas pressure). We pioneered the analysis of the combined operation of
the magnetospheric MHD compressor and MHD generator which, in essence, represent a
materialization of Kennel’s idea of simultaneous existence of convection and precipitation
in magnetospheric plasma.

Asymmetric polarity reversals, bimodal ﬁeld distribution, and coherence resonance in
a spherically symmetric mean-ﬁeld dynamo model

Using a mean-ﬁeld dynamo model with a spherically symmetric helical turbulence parameter α
which is dynamically quenched and disturbed by additional noise, the basic features of geomagnetic
polarity reversals are shown to be generic consequences of the dynamo action in the vicinity of
exceptional points of the spectrum. This simple paradigmatic model yields long periods of constant
polarity which are interrupted by self-accelerating ﬁeld decays leading to asymmetric polarity rever-
sals. It shows the recently discovered bimodal ﬁeld distribution, and it gives a natural explanation
of the correlation between polarity persistence time and ﬁeld strength. In addition, we ﬁnd typical
features of coherence resonance in the dependence of the persistence time on the noise.

The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is known to undergo irreg-
ular polarity reversals, with a mean reversal rate that
varies from zero in the Permian and Cretaceous super-
crons to (4-5) per Myr in the present [1]. Typically, these
reversals have an asymmetric (saw-toothed) shape, i.e.
the ﬁeld of one polarity decays slowly and recovers very
rapidly with the opposite polarity, possibly to rather high
intensities [2]. A general correlation between the persis-
tence time and the ﬁeld intensity has also been suspected
since long [3]. A recent observation concerns the bimodal
distribution of the Earth dipole moment with two peaks
at about 4 × 1022 Am2 and at about twice that value [4].

The explanation of these phenomena represents a great
challenge for dynamo theory and numerics. Remarkably,
the last decade has seen three-dimensional numerical sim-
ulations of the geodynamo with sudden polarity reversals
as one of the most impressive results (cf. [5] for a recent
overview).

Despite the fact that those simulations exhibit many
features of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld quite well, and be-
cause they do so in parameter regions (in particular for
the Ekman and the magnetic Prandtl number) that are
far away from the real ones, there is a complimentary
tradition to identify the essential ingredients of reversals
within the framework of simpliﬁed dynamo models. This
has been done, e.g., in the tradition of the celebrated
Rikitake dynamo model of two coupled disk dynamos [6].
Another approach has been pursued by Hoyng and col-
laborators [7] who studied a prototype nonlinear mean-
ﬁeld dynamo model which is reduced to an equation sys-
tem for the amplitudes of the non-periodic axisymmet-
ric dipole mode and for one periodic overtone under the
inﬂuence of stochastic forcing.
Interestingly, even this
simple model shows sudden reversals and a Poissonian
distribution of the polarity persistence time. However,
an essential ingredient of this model to account for the
correct reversal duration and persistence time is the use
of a large turbulent resistivity which is hardly justiﬁed,

at least not by the recent dynamo experiments [8].

Sarson and Jones [9] had noticed the importance of the
transition from non-oscillatory to oscillatory states for re-
versals to occur. It is our goal to understand this process
in more detail by studying a simple mean-ﬁeld dynamo
model. We focus on the magnetic ﬁeld dynamics in the
vicinity of ”exceptional points” [10] of the spectrum of
a non-selfadjoint operator. We will show that the main
characteristics of Earth magnetic ﬁeld reversals can be
attributed to the square-root character of the spectrum
in the vicinity of such exceptional points, where two non-
oscillatory eigenmodes coalesce and continue as an oscil-
latory eigenmode.

Our starting point is the well known induction equa-
tion ˙B = ∇ × (αB) + (µ0σ)−1∆B for a mean-ﬁeld dy-
namo with a helical turbulence parameter α [11], acting
in a ﬂuid with electrical conductivity σ within a sphere
of radius R. The magnetic ﬁeld has to be divergence-
free,∇ · B = 0. Henceforth, we will measure the length
in units of R, the time in units of µ0σR2, and the param-
eter α in units of (µ0σR)−1. Note that for the Earth we
get a time scale µ0σR2 ∼ 200 Kyr, giving a free decay
time of 20 Kyr for the dipole ﬁeld.

We decompose B into a poloidal and a toroidal part,
B = −∇ × (r × ∇S) − r × ∇T . The deﬁning scalars

S and T are expanded in spherical harmonics of degree l
and order m with the expansion coeﬃcients sl,m(r, t) and
tl,m(r, t). In order to allow for very long simulations (to
get a good statistics for the persistence time and the ﬁeld
amplitudes), we consider an α2 dynamo with a radially
symmetric helical turbulence parameter α. In [12] we had
shown that such simple α2 dynamos can exhibit oscilla-
tory behaviour in case that α(r) changes its sign along
the radius, which is not unrealistic for the Earth [13].
For spherically symmetric and isotropic α, the induction
equation decouples for each l and m into the following
pair of equations:

These equations are independent of the order m, hence
we have skipped it in the index of s and t. The boundary
conditions are ∂sl/∂r|r=1 + (l + 1)sl(1) = tl(1) = 0.

In the following we restrict ourselves to the dipole ﬁeld
with l = 1 (the inﬂuence of higher multipole ﬁelds will be
considered elsewhere). At ﬁrst, we choose a particular ra-
dial proﬁle α(r) which can yield an oscillatory behaviour
[12]. Magnetic ﬁeld saturation is ensured by quenching
the parameter α(r, t) with the angular averaged dipole
ﬁeld energy which can be expressed in terms of s1(r, t)
and t1(r, t). In addition to that, we perturb the α-proﬁle
by noisy ”blobs” which are assumed constant within a
correlation time τ . In summary, α(r, t) takes the form:

verse equipartition ﬁeld energy.

The equation system (1)-(3) is time-stepped using an
Adams-Bashforth method with a radial grid spacing of
0.02 and a time step length of 2 × 10−5. For the following
examples, the correlation time τ has been set to 0.02, and
E has been chosen to be 0.01.

For the noise-free case (D = 0), we show in Fig. 1
the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld for diﬀerent values of
C (hereafter, ”ﬁeld” stands always for the value of s1
at r = 0.95). At the slightly overcritical value C = 1.1
we observe a nearly harmonic oscillation with a frequency
close to one. With increasing C, this frequency decreases,
and at the same time the signal becomes saw-toothed (or
better: ”shark-ﬁn shaped”) and eventually rectangular.
At the critical point CT = 1.27893 a phase transition
to a non-oscillatory dynamo occurs, which can also be
identiﬁed in the frequencies and ﬁeld amplitudes shown
in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 3, we analyze the ﬁeld evolution for C = 1.2789
in detail. Figure 3a shows the ﬁeld during one reversal,
together with the growth rate and the frequency that re-
sult from the instantaneous, quenched α-proﬁle. Eight
of these proﬁles (at the moments 1-8), together with the
unquenched proﬁle, are scaled by a factor C′ yielding
the growth rate curves of Fig. 3b. These curves may
help us to identify the following phases for a reversal:
a slowly starting, but self-accelerating ﬁeld decay in the
non-oscillatory branch (points 1 and 2), followed by the
actual polarity reversal in the oscillatory branch (between
points 3 and 4), a fast increase of the ﬁeld (points 4-6)
which results in a rapid α-quenching. This rapid quench-
ing drives the system back to the point 8 which basically
corresponds to the initial point 1, only with the opposite
ﬁeld polarity. A peculiarity of our particular model is the
existence of a second exceptional point beyond which the
dynamo becomes non-oscillatory again (between points
5 and 6), which is, however, not crucial for the indicated
reversal process.

In an attempt to simplify this reversal picture, we con-
sider in Fig. 4 all growth rate curves of Fig. 3b as being
collapsed into a single one (for that purpose we neglect
their slight shape diﬀerences and consider only a shift).
By this ”optical trick”, the various phases of reversals
can be visualized as a ”move” of the actual growth rate
point relative to this collapsed growth rate curve. Figure
4 explains also the phase transition between oscillatory
and steady dynamos and the discontinuity of the ﬁeld
amplitude from Fig. 2. The local maximum of the non-
oscillatory branch of the growth rate curve is unstable
and repels the dynamo in two diﬀerent directions, de-
pending on whether the growth rate there is negative or
positive. If it is negative, the ﬁeld decays, we get weaker
α quenching, and a subsequent reversal. If it is positive,
the ﬁeld increases, we get stronger α quenching, hence

the system moves to the left of the maximum.

What happens now if we switch on the noise? The
inﬂuence of the noise is quite diﬀerent for values of C
below and above CT . For C > CT , the noise is the
only possibility to trigger a move from left of the local
maximum to the right, hence the persistence time will
decrease from inﬁnity to some ﬁnite value. For C < CT ,
the noise will sometimes push the maximum above the
zero growth rate line allowing the system to jump to the
left of the maximum where it can stay for a while. Hence,
we will get an increase of the persistence time.

For a moderate noise intensity D = 0.5, we depict in
Fig. 5 the time evolution for the values C = 1.27 and
C = 1.29 which are slightly below and above CT , respec-
tively. First of all, a drastic diﬀerence between the per-
sistence times is still visible. The duration of a reversal,
however, is quite identical for both values of C, although
its sensible deﬁnition is not obvious. With a side view on
the real geomagnetic ﬁeld (for which the dipole compo-
nent should decay approximately to the strength of the
non-dipole components before a reversal can be identi-
ﬁed), we tentatively deﬁne the reversal duration as the
time the ﬁeld spends between ±1/4 or ±1/10 of its mean
intensity. In the ﬁrst case we get a reversal duration of
30 Kyr, in the second case of 12 Kyr, which comes close
to the observational facts.

each point, a minimum of 10

reversals was used.

For both values, C = 1.27 and C = 1.29, a bimodal
behaviour of the dynamo can be observed in the ﬁeld
histograms of Fig. 6. For C = 1.27 and D = 0.15,
we observe a clear double peak on both polarity sides,
centered approximately at ±0.18 and ±0.27. Evidently,
the dynamo is mostly in the weak ﬁeld state (right of
the maximum, cp. Fig. 4), with some ”excursions” to
the strong ﬁeld state (left of the maximum). With in-
creasing D this double peak is smeared out, leaving a
very broad maximum for D = 0.5. The three histograms
for C = 1.29 show a maximum at the strong ﬁeld value
and (although not a maximum) a pronounced ﬂatten-
ing at the weak ﬁeld value. This means, the dynamo is
mostly in the strong ﬁeld state, with some intermediate
stopovers in the weak ﬁeld state, from where it can start
a reversal.

An overview about the mean persistence time hT i and
its normalized standard deviation σ(T )/hT i in depen-
dence on C and D is given in Fig. 7. Note the drastic
diﬀerence that small values of noise have on the dynamo
behaviour for C < CT and C > CT . The normalized
standard deviation, at least for the curves with C > 1.26,
has a clear minimum around D = 3 which represents a
typical feature of coherence resonance [14]. We only note
here that recently stochastic resonance models have been
discussed with view on a possible triggering of ﬁeld rever-
sals by the 100 Kyr period of the Earth orbit eccentricity
[15].

To summarize, our simple spherically symmetric α2
dynamo model shows that asymmetric polarity reversals
and bimodal ﬁeld distributions are generic features of the
dynamo behaviour in the vicinity of exceptional points.
Using only the molecular resistivity of the outer core, we

4

get typical persistence times of the order of 200 Kyr (and
larger), and a typical reversal duration of 10-30 Kyr.

We point out that this model is not a physical model
of the Earth dynamo, in particular owing to the miss-
ing North-South asymmetry of α. Nevertheless, we are
convinced that the generic features of dynamos in the
vicinity of exceptional points as they were illustrated in
this paper can also be identiﬁed in much more elaborated
dynamo models.

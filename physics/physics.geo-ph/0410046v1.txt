We present a three–pronged numerical approach to the dynamo problem at low magnetic Prandtl
numbers PM . The diﬃculty of resolving a large range of scales is circumvented by combining Direct
Numerical Simulations, a Lagrangian-averaged model, and Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). The
ﬂow is generated by the Taylor-Green forcing; it combines a well deﬁned structure at large scales
and turbulent ﬂuctuations at small scales. Our main ﬁndings are: (i) dynamos are observed from
−2; (ii) the critical magnetic Reynolds number increases sharply with
PM = 1 down to PM = 10
−1
P
M as turbulence sets in and then saturates; (iii) in the linear growth phase, the most unstable
magnetic modes move to small scales as PM is decreased and a Kazantsev k3/2 spectrum develops;
then the dynamo grows at large scales and modiﬁes the turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations.

The generation of magnetic ﬁelds in celestial bodies
occurs in media for which the viscosity ν and the mag-
netic diﬀusivity η are vastly diﬀerent. For example, in
the interstellar medium the magnetic Prandtl number
PM = ν/η has been estimated to be as large as 1014,
whereas in stars such as the Sun and for planets such
as the Earth, it can be very low (PM < 10−5, the value
for the Earth’s iron core). Similarly in liquid breeder
reactors and in laboratory experiments in liquid met-
als, PM ≪
1. At the same time, the Reynolds number
RV = U L/ν (U is the r.m.s. velocity, L is the integral
scale of the ﬂow) is very large, and the ﬂow is highly com-
plex and turbulent, with prevailing non-linear eﬀects ren-
dering the problem diﬃcult to address. If in the smallest
scales of astrophysical objects plasma eﬀects may prevail,
the large scales are adequately described by the equations
of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD),

Several mechanisms have been studied for dynamo ac-
tion, both analytically and numerically, involving in par-
ticular the role of helicity [1] (i.e. the correlation between
velocity and its curl, the vorticity) for dynamo growth
at scales larger than that of the velocity, and the role
of chaotic ﬁelds for small-scale growth of magnetic ex-
citation (for a recent review, see [2]). Granted that the

stretching and folding of magnetic ﬁeld lines by veloc-
ity gradients overcome dissipation, dynamo action takes
place above a critical magnetic Reynolds number Rc
M ,
with RM = PM RV = U L/η. Dynamo experiments en-
gineering constrained helical ﬂows of liquid sodium have
been successful [3]. However, these experimental setups
do not allow for a complete investigation of the dynam-
ical regime, and many groups have searched to imple-
ment unconstrained dynamos [4]. Two diﬃculties arise:
ﬁrst, turbulence now becomes fully developed with ve-
locity ﬂuctuations reaching up to 40% of the mean; sec-
ond, it is diﬃcult to engineer ﬂows with helical small
scales so that the net eﬀect of turbulence is uncertain.
Recent Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) address the
case of randomly forced, non-helical ﬂows with magnetic
Prandtl numbers from 1 to 0.1. Contradictory results
are obtained: it is shown in [5] that dynamo action can
be inhibited for PM < 1/4, while it is observed in [2]
that the dynamo threshold increases as P
down to
0.3. Experiments made in von K´arm´an geometries
PM ∼
(either spherical or cylindrical) have reached RM values
up to 60 [6]. Also, MHD turbulence at low PM has been
studied in the idealized context of turbulent closures [7].
In this context, turbulent dynamos are found, and the
dependences of Rc
M upon three quantities are studied,
namely PM , the relative rate of helicity injection, and
the forcing scale. An increase of
M is ob-
10−5. Recently,

the Kazantsev-Kraichnan [8] model of δ-correlated ve-
locity ﬂuctuations has been used to study the eﬀect of
turbulence. It is shown that the threshold increases with
the rugosity of the ﬂow ﬁeld [9], and that turbulence can
either increase or decrease the dynamo threshold depend-
ing on the ﬁne structure of the velocity ﬂuctuations [10].

situation where the ﬂow forcing is not random, but gen-
erates a well deﬁned geometry at large scales, with tur-
bulence developing naturally at small scales as the RV
increases. This situation complements recent numerical
works [2, 5, 9, 10] and is quite relevant for planetary and
laboratory ﬂows. Speciﬁcally, we consider the swirling
ﬂow resulting from the Taylor-Green forcing [11]:

with k0 = 2, so that dynamo action is free to develop
at scales larger or smaller than the forcing scale kf =
k0√3. This force generates ﬂow cells that have locally
diﬀerential rotation and helicity, two key ingredients for
dynamo action [1, 2]. Note that the net helicity, i.e.
averaged in time and space, is zero in the 2π-periodic
domain. However strong local ﬂuctuations of helicity are
always present in the ﬂow. Small scales are statistically
non-helical. The resulting ﬂow also shares similarities
with the Maryland, Cadarache and Wisconsin sodium
experiments [4], and it has motivated several numerical
studies at PM ∼

1 [12, 13].

Our numerical study begins with DNS in a 3D periodic
domain. The code uses a pseudo-spectral algorithm, an
explicit second order Runge-Kutta advance in time, and
a classical dealiasing rule — the last resolved wavenum-
ber is k = N/3 where N is the number of grid points per
dimension. Resolutions from 643 to 5123 grid points are
used, to cover PM from 1 to 1/5. However, DNS are lim-
ited in the Reynolds numbers and the (lowest) PM they
can reach. We then use a second method, the LAMHD
(or α) model,
in which we integrate the Lagrangian-
averaged MHD equations [14, 15]. This formulation
leads to a drastic reduction in the degrees of freedom
at small scales by the introduction of smoothing lengths
αV and αM . The ﬁelds are written as the sum of ﬁltered
(smoothed) and ﬂuctuating components: v = us + δv,

In the resulting equations, the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld
are smoothed, but not the ﬁelds’ sources, i.e. the vortic-
ity and the current density [16]. This model has been
checked in the ﬂuid case against experiments and DNS
of the Navier-Stokes equations in 3D [17], as well as in
MHD in 2D [15]. Finally, in order to reach still lower
PM , we implement an LES model. LES are commonly
used and well tested in ﬂuid dynamics against laboratory
experiments and DNS in a variety of ﬂow conﬁgurations
[18], but their extension to MHD is still in its infancy
(see however [19]). We use a scheme as introduced in [20],
aimed at integrating the primitive MHD equations with a
turbulent velocity ﬁeld all the way down to the magnetic
diﬀusion with no modeling in the induction equation but
with the help of a dynamical eddy viscosity [21]:

Kc is the cut-oﬀ wavenumber of the velocity ﬁeld, and
EV (k, t) is the one-dimensional kinetic energy spectrum.
A consistency condition for our approach is that the mag-
netic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations be fully resolved when 2π/Kc is
smaller than the magnetic diﬀusive scale ℓη ∼
The numerical methods, parameters of the runs, and
associated characteristic quantities are given in Table I.
In all cases, we ﬁrst perform a hydrodynamic run, lasting
about 10 turnover times, to obtain a statistically steady
ﬂow. Then we add a seed magnetic ﬁeld, and monitor
the growth of the magnetic energy EM for a time that
depends on the run resolution; it is of the order of 1 mag-
netic diﬀusion time τη = (2π)2/η at 643, but it drops
down to τη/5 at 5123. We deﬁne the magnetic energy
growth rate as σ = d log EM /dt, computed in the linear
regime (t is in units of large scale turnover time). The
dynamo threshold corresponds to σ = 0. For each conﬁg-
uration (Table I), we make several MHD simulations with
diﬀerent PM , varying η, and for a ﬁxed RV deﬁned by
the hydrodynamic run. We bound the marginal growth
between clearly decaying and growing evolutions of the
magnetic energy. This procedure is unavoidable because
of the critical slowing down near threshold.

At PM = 1, the dynamo self-generates at Rc

M = 30. As
PM is lowered, we observe in the DNS that the thresh-
old reaches Rc
M = 70 at PM = 0.5 and then increases
steeply to Rc
M = 226 at PM = 0.3; at lower PM it does
not increase anymore, but drops slightly to a value of
200 at PM = 0.2 (Fig.1 and Table I). We then continue
with LAMHD simulations to reach lower PM . To en-
sure the consistency of the method, we have run over-
lapping DNS and LAMHD simulations in the range from
PM = 0.4
0.2, the agreement of the two methods being
evaluated by the matching of the magnetic energy growth
(or decay) rates for identical (PM , RM ) parameters. We
have observed that a good agreement between the two
methods can be reached if one uses two diﬀerent ﬁltering
scales αV and αM in LAMHD, chosen to maintain a di-
mensional relationship between the magnetic and kinetic

−

3/4
dissipation scales, namely αV /αM = P
M . Our obser-
vation with the LAMHD computations is that the steep
increase in Rc
M to a value over 250 is being followed by a
plateau for PM values down to 0.09. We do note a small
but systematic trend of the LAMHD simulations to over-
estimate the threshold compared to DNS. We attribute
it to the increased turbulent intermittency generated by
the α model, but further investigations are required to
describe fully this eﬀect. The LES simulations allow us
to further our investigation; with this model the thresh-
old for dynamo self-generation remains constant, of the
order of 150, for PM between 10−1 and 10−2.

In regards to the generation of dynamo action in the
Taylor-Green geometry we thus ﬁnd: (i) at all PM in-
vestigated a dynamo threshold exists; (ii) as PM drops
below 0.2 - 0.3, the critical Rc
M levels and remains of
the order of 200; (iii) the steep initial increase in Rc
M is
identiﬁed with the development of an inertial range in the
spectra of kinetic energy. As the kinetic energy spectrum
grows progressively into a Kolmogorov k−5/3 spectrum,
Rc
M ceases to have signiﬁcant changes – cf. Table I.
We plot in Fig. 2 the magnetic energy spectra EM (k)
during the linear growth phase, at identical instants when
normalized by the growth rate. Four features are note-
worthy: ﬁrst, the dynamo grows from a broad range of
modes; second, the maximum of EM (k) moves progres-
sively to smaller scales as PM decreases, a result already
found numerically in [2]; third, a self-similar magnetic
k3/2, develops at the beginning dur-
spectrum, EM (k)
ing the linear growth phase — as predicted by Kazant-
sev [8] and found in other numerical simulations of dy-
namo generation by turbulent ﬂuctuations [2, 5]. This is
a feature that thus persists when the ﬂow has well deﬁned
mean geometry in addition to turbulence. Lastly we ob-
serve that the initial magnetic growth at small scales is
always followed by a second phase where the magnetic
ﬁeld grows in the (large) scales of the Taylor-Green ﬂow.
Figure 3 shows renderings of the magnetic energy and
compare low and high Reynolds number cases. When the
30
dynamo is generated at low Reynolds number (RV ∼
and PM = 1), the magnetic ﬁeld is smooth. As PM
decreases and the dynamo grows from a turbulent ﬁeld,
one ﬁrst observes a complex magnetic ﬁeld pattern – for

t < 40, in the example shown in Fig.3(center). But as
non-linear eﬀects develop (here for times t > 40) a large
scale mode (k = 2) dominates the growth with a struc-
ture that is similar to the one at low RV . The initial
growth of small scale magnetic ﬁelds and the subsequent
transfer to a large scale dynamo mode is also clearly vis-
ible on the development in time of the magnetic and ki-
netic energies, in a high RV case, as shown in Fig. 4.
During the linear growth, a wide interval of modes in-
crease in a self-similar fashion, accounting for the com-
plexity of the dynamo ﬁeld - cf. Fig. 3(center). At a
later time, the large scale ﬁeld grows and the kinetic en-
ergy spectrum EV (k) is progressively modiﬁed at inertial
scales. The spectral slope changes from a Kolmogorov
k−5/3 scaling to a steeper, close to k−3, regime [22]. The
eﬀect is to modify the turbulent scales and to favor the
dynamo mode that is allowed by the large scale ﬂow ge-
ometry. This is consistent with the development of a
k−5 magnetic spectrum, observed in the Karlsruhe dy-
namo experiment [23]. It also corroborates the claim [24]
that the saturation of the turbulent dynamo starts with
the back-reaction of the Lorentz force on the turbulent
ﬂuctuations.

To conclude, using a combination of DNS, LAMHD
modeling and LES, we show that, for the Taylor-Green
ﬂow forcing, there is a strong increase in the critical mag-
netic Reynolds number for dynamo action when PM is
decreased, directly linked to the development of turbu-
lence; and it is followed by a plateau on a large range of
10−2. In a situation with both a
PM from
mean ﬂow and turbulent ﬂuctuations, we ﬁnd that the
selection of the dynamo mode results from a subtle in-
teraction between the large and small scales.

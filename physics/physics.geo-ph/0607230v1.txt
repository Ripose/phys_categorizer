A signiﬁcant fraction of the 44TW of heat dissipation from the Earth’s interior is believed to
originate from the decays of terrestrial uranium and thorium. The only estimates of this radiogenic
heat, which is the driving force for mantle convection, come from Earth models based on meteorites,
and have large systematic errors. The detection of electron antineutrinos produced by these uranium
and thorium decays would allow a more direct measure of the total uranium and thorium content,
and hence radiogenic heat production in the Earth. We discuss the prospect of building an electron
antineutrino detector approximately 700 m3 in size in the Homestake mine at the 4850’ level. This
would allow us to make a measurement of the total uranium and thorium content with a statistical
error less than the systematic error from our current knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters.
It would also allow us to test the hypothesis of a naturally occurring nuclear reactor at the center
of the Earth.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Thanks in part to Ray Davis’ pioneering neutrino
experiment[1] located in the Homestake mine(44.35◦ N,
103.75◦ W), more is now known about the interior work-
ings of the Sun than the Earth. The KamLAND collab-
oration has recently investigated electron antineutrinos
originating from the interior of the Earth[2]; however, the
sensitivity achieved was limited by a large background
from surrounding nuclear power reactors. A similar ex-
periment located deep underground to reduce cosmic-ray
backgrounds, and away from nuclear power plants, could
reach a sensitivity that would allow constraints to be
placed on our current knowledge of the Earth’s interior.
The idea of using electron antineutrinos, ¯νe’s, to study
processes inside the Earth was ﬁrst suggested by Eder[3]
238U, 232Th, and 40K decays within the
and Marx[4].
Earth are believed to be responsible for the majority of
the current radiogenic heat production, which is the driv-
ing force for Earth mantle convection, the process which
causes plate tectonics and earthquakes. These decays
also produce ¯νe’s, the vast majority of which reach the
Earth’s surface since neutrinos hardly interact with mat-
ter, allowing a direct measurement of the total Earth
radiogenic heat production by these isotopes.

The regional composition of the Earth is determined
by a number of diﬀerent methods. The deepest hole ever
dug penetrates 12 km of the crust[5], allowing direct sam-
pling from only a small fraction of the Earth. Lava ﬂows
bring xenoliths, foreign crystals in igneous rock, from the
upper mantle to the surface. The regional composition
of the Earth can also be modeled by comparing physical
properties determined from seismic data to laboratory
measurements. Our current knowledge suggests that the
crust and mantle are composed mainly of silica, with the
crust enriched in U, Th, and K. The core is composed
mainly of Fe but includes a small fraction of lighter ele-

Earth’s core. The concentration of radiogenic elements in the
mantle is obtained by subtracting the isotope mass in the
crust from the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) model.

Models of Earth composition based on the solar abun-
dance data[6] establish the composition of the undiﬀeren-
tiated mantle in the early formation stage of the Earth,
referred to as “Bulk Silicate Earth” (BSE). Table I in-
cludes the estimated concentration of U, Th, and K in
the BSE model. The ratio of Th/U by weight, between
3.7 and 4.1[7], is known better than the total abundance
of each element.

The rate of radiogenic heat released from U, Th,
and K decays are 98.1 µW kg−1, 26.4 µW kg−1, and
0.0035 µW kg−1[8], respectively. Table II summarizes the
total radiogenic heat production rate of these elements
in the Earth regions based on the masses and concentra-
tions given in Table I. For comparison, the rate of mantle
heating due to lunar tides is a negligible ∼ 0.12 TW[9].
The radiogenic heat production within the Earth can
be compared to the measured heat dissipation rate at the
surface. Based on the rock conductivity and temperature
gradient in bore holes measured at 20,201 sites, the esti-

mated heat dissipation rate from oceanic and continental
crust, respectively, is 31.2 ± 0.7 TW and 13.0 ± 0.3 TW,
resulting in a total of 44.2 ± 1.0 TW[12]. In this study
the majority of the heat is lost through the oceanic crust,
despite the fact that the continental crust contains the
majority of the radiogenic heat producing elements. A
recent re-evalutaion of the same data[13] suggests that
the heat dissipation rate in the oceanic crust is signiﬁ-
cantly less, resulting in a total heat dissipation rate of
31.0 ± 1.0 TW. The measured heat ﬂow per unit area at
the Earth’s surface surrounding the Homestake mine[14]
is consistent with the continental crust average, which
suggests that increased local uranium concentration is
not signiﬁcant.

The Urey ratio, the ratio between mantle heat dis-
sipation and production, indicates what fraction of the
current heat ﬂow is due to primordial heat. Subtract-
ing the continental crust heat production rate of 6.5 TW,
the mantle is dissipating heat at a rate of 37.7 TW and,
assuming the BSE model, generating heat at a rate of
13.2 TW, giving a Urey ratio of ∼0.35. It is widely be-
lieved that the mantle convects although the exact nature
of that convection is still unclear. Models of mantle con-
vection give Urey ratios greater than ∼0.69[15, 16, 17],
which is inconsistent with the value obtained from heat
considerations. A direct measurement of the terrestrial
radiogenic heat production rate would help our under-
standing of this apparent inconsistency.

II. GEONEUTRINO SIGNAL

A ¯νe is produced whenever a nucleus β− decays. The
238U and 232Th decay chains[18] both contain at least
four β− decays, and 40K β− decays with a branching
fraction of 89.28%. These β− decays result in the well
established ¯νe energy distributions for 238U, 232Th, and
40K shown in Figure 1. Because ¯νe’s have such a small
cross-section for interaction with matter, the majority of
these ¯νe’s produced within the Earth reach the surface.
However, due to a phenomenon usually referred to as
“neutrino oscillation”, the ¯νe may change into a ¯νµ or ¯ντ .
The probability of the ¯νe being found in the same state as
a function of distance traveled, L, can be approximated

The most common method[2, 20, 21] for detecting ¯νe’s

is neutron inverse β decay,

¯νe + p −→ e+ + n.

(2)

The detection of both the positron, e+, and neutron, n,
separated by a small distance and time, greatly reduces
the number of backgrounds. Due to the reaction thresh-
old, the minimum ¯νe energy detectable by this method
is 1.8 MeV, which has the disadvantage that the 40K ¯νe’s
cannot be detected since they have a maximum energy of
1.3 MeV. To zeroth order in 1/M, where M is the nucleon
mass, the total positron energy, W (0)
, is related to the
total antineutrino energy, Wν, by

e

W (0)

e = Wν − mn + mp,

(3)

where mn and mp are the neutron and proton masses,
respectively. Therefore, the ¯νe energy can be estimated
from a measurement of the positron kinetic energy. This
allows spectral separation of the ¯νe’s from 238U and 232Th
decays.

The geoneutrino observation rate depends on the decay
rate of 238U and 232Th, the resulting ¯νe energy distribu-
tion, the detection cross-section, the neutrino oscillation
parameters, and the distribution of the 238U and 232Th
in the Earth. Based on a detailed simulation[22], in-
cluding seismic models of crustal thickness, the number
of neutron inverse β decays at Homestake due to ter-
restrial 238U and 232Th is estimated to be 54 per 1032

target protons per year, assuming sin2 2θ12 = 0.816. The
lines labeled 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 2 show the cumulative
geoneutrino ﬂuxes as a function of distance from detec-
tors located over continental crust of varying thickness
and with varying contributions from neighboring oceanic
crust. A detector located in the Homestake mine could
expect ∼ 50 % of the geoneutrino ﬂux originating within
∼ 500 km of the detector.

With ∼ 50 % of the geoneutrino ﬂux originating within
∼ 500 km of the detector it is important to remove the
eﬀects of local geology to obtain a global measurement of
the total 238U and 232Th concentration. The estimated
error in the signal from local geology for the recent Kam-
LAND geoneutrino measurement is 16 %[23]. The near-
est known uranium reserve[24] is located ∼ 100 km from
the Homestake mine at the boundary of Wyoming and
South Dakota. To place an upper limit on the impact
of local concentrations of uranium and thorium, we as-
sume that the Earth’s total reasonably assured uranium
reserves of 3600 kton uranium[25] were located 100 km
from the proposed detector. This would contribute less
than 0.03 % to the expected global signal. A possi-
ble heat ﬂow measurement in the Homestake mine and
uranium and thorium concentrations obtained from the
Homestake mine core samples[26] could be used to reduce
the systematic uncertainties associated with geoneutrinos
originating from within ∼ 10 km of the detector.

It has been suggested that a large amount of uranium
may be located in the core of the Earth[27] forming a
natural nuclear reactor. This could produce up to 6 TW
of heat, powering the Earth’s dynamo.
It would also
lead to 3He production which could explain the observed
anomaly in the 3He/4He ratio for gases from the Earth’s
mantle. Excluding neutrino oscillation, a natural reactor
at the Earth’s core would produce a very similar energy
spectrum of detected ¯νe’s to that from commercial nu-
clear power reactors, which is peaked at ∼ 4 MeV and
extends up to ∼ 9 MeV, see Figure 4. In order to accu-
rately test this hypothesis it is necessary to have a very
low commercial nuclear reactor background. The num-
ber of ¯νe’s detected by neutron inverse β decay near the
surface of the Earth is expected to be approximately 40
per 1032 target protons per year due to a 6 TW nuclear
reactor at the Earth’s core, assuming sin2 2θ12 = 0.816.

III. BACKGROUNDS

The detection of correlated signals in neutron in-
verse β decay signiﬁcantly enhances the detectability
of the geoneutrinos. Nevertheless, other events con-
tribute backgrounds to the measurement. Backgrounds
can typically be subdivided into three main categories:
natural radioactivity, cosmic-rays and associated spalla-
tion products, and other ¯νe sources. The most signiﬁ-
cant backgrounds in the recent KamLAND geoneutrino
measurement[2] were ¯νe’s from nearby nuclear power re-
actors and 13C(α, n) reactions where the α is primarily

located over thick continental crust. The Kamioka curve is for
a detector located at the boundary of continental and oceanic
crust. The LNGS curve is for a detector located over conti-
nental crust; this probably best represents a detector located
at the Homestake mine. The Hawaii curve is for a detector
located over oceanic crust; this most closely matches the ﬂux
from the mantle, since there is no high local uranium and
thorium concentrations.

from 210Pb decay.

A.

¯νe sources

Figure 3 shows that the Homestake mine is located
more than 750 km away from any major nuclear power
reactor. Based on the rated maximum thermal power,
and excluding neutrino oscillation, the expected rate of
¯νe’s from nuclear reactors is calculated to be 64 per 1032
target proton yr. Since the ¯νe’s typically travel distances
greater than 1000 km, the ¯νe survival probability due to
neutrino oscillation can be approximated by P (Eν , L) ≈
1 − 0.5 sin2 2θ12, which equals 0.592 assuming sin2 2θ12 =
0.816. Therefore, the expected rate in the geoneutrino
region, below 3.4 MeV, and including neutrino oscillation,
is only 11 per 1032 target proton yr, which is ∼ 7 % of
the expected rate at KamLAND[2].

Figure 4 shows the expected spectra for geoneutrinos,
commercial nuclear reactors, and a natural nuclear reac-
tor at the Earth’s core. The commercial reactor back-
ground is insigniﬁcant for the geoneutrino measurement.
It is also small enough to allow an ultimate sensitivity

4

reducing this background by a factor of one million, mak-
ing this background negligible in the liquid scintillator.

The next most signiﬁcant radioactive background is
due to random correlations caused by radioactivity in
the detector, mostly from U, Th, K, and Rn decays. The
KamLAND experiment achieved U, Th, and 40K concen-
trations in the scintillator of 6 × 10−16 g/g, 2 × 10−16 g/g,
and 2×10−16 g/g, respectively. This resulted in negligible
random coincidences due to radioactivity in the scintil-
lator. However, radioactivity within the detector enclo-
sure and surrounding rock, required a ﬁducial volume cut
which reduced the eﬀective detector mass.

Based on the results achieved with KamLAND, the pu-
rities required to perform this measurement for future ex-
periments are clearly possible. However, the exact purity
needed depends on the ﬁnal detector design, discussed in
Section IV.

C. Cosmic-ray backgrounds

Cosmic-ray muons produce energetic neutrons and ra-
dioactive isotopes which can mimic the neutron inverse
β decay signature. The eﬀect of energetic neutrons and
cosmogenic radioactivity is reduced by vetoing the de-
tector after a muon passes through. There is a small
residual background due to muon vetoing ineﬃciency and
backgrounds caused by muons that pass through the rock
surrounding the detector without detection in the muon
veto.

The recent KamLAND result[2] had a negligible back-
ground due to energetic neutrons and a background due
to cosmogenic radioactivity of 0.6 per 1032 target proton
yr. Because of the greater rock overburden at the 4850’
level of the Homestake mine, the energetic neutron and
cosmogenic backgrounds are expected to be ∼ 20 times
less than those at the KamLAND site[30]. The exact
cosmic-ray background rates will depend on the detec-
tor material, layout, and veto eﬃciency, although it is
expected that in almost any ﬁnal design this will be neg-
ligible.

IV. THE DETECTOR

In past experiments, both liquid scintillator and wa-
ter Cherenkov detectors have been used to observe the
positron and neutron produced in neutron inverse β de-
cay. Both techniques detect the photons emitted as
charged particles move through the detector. The neu-
tron is detected via the γ-ray emitted from its capture
by a nucleus in the detecting material.

Water Cherenkov detectors produce a cone of light
which allows the direction of the charged particle to be
determined, and therefore allowing the direction of the ¯νe
to be inferred. The Cherenkov photon yield is generally
much less than the scintillation light yield, and conse-
quently water Cherenkov detectors have poor sensitivity

of 1.3 TW at 99 % CL, limited by the systematic un-
certainty in the commercial reactor ﬂux, for a nuclear
reactor at the Earth’s core. This assumes that the com-
mercial reactor background can be obtained to 10 % ac-
curacy, which should be possible based on the published
electrical power and an averaged core nuclear cycle. If
the isotopic ﬁssion rates of the reactors can be obtained
the reactor background could be determined to ∼ 2 %
accuracy[20, 21, 29].

B. Radioactive backgrounds

The largest radioactive background in the recent Kam-
LAND measurement was due to the reaction 13C(α, n).
The neutron produces two events, one as it loses energy,
and the second when it captures on a proton. This mim-
ics the ¯νe events. The α in this reaction is a product of
210Pb decay, which is itself a product from the decay of
radon (Rn) gas present in the detector during construc-
tion. There is a plan to purify the KamLAND detector,

to events with energy less than ∼ 4 MeV. A typical liquid
scintillator detector easily observes ¯νe’s at the neutron
inverse β decay threshold. However, liquid scintillator
detectors do not have very good directional information.

ment of the 238U to 232Th ratio would require a larger
detector, or a longer exposure time.

B. Detector Design

A. Requirements

The following measurements and test should be per-
formed by the proposed detector: measure the total
geoneutrino rate, measure the ratio of 238U to 232Th in
the Earth’s interior, and test the hypothesis of a natu-
ral nuclear reactor at the Earth’s core. Excluding the
238U and 232Th distribution in the Earth, the largest er-
ror in determining the expected geoneutrino rate is due
to the uncertainty in the neutrino oscillation parameter
sin2 2θ12 which is known to ∼ 6 %. It is unlikely that the
accuracy of this parameter will be determined to better
than a few percent within the next decade. Therefore, it
does not make sense to plan on measuring the geoneu-
trino rate to much better than 6 %. Assuming a 10%
error in the commercial nuclear reactor background, and
only using the ¯νe spectrum below 3.4 MeV, to measure
the total geoneutrino rate to ∼ 10 % the required expo-
sure is estimated to be ∼ 2.3×1032 target proton yr. This
does not include systematic errors, but these should be
constrained to better than 10 %.

In determining the ratio of 238U to 232Th many errors
cancel, therefore it should be possible to obtain a mea-
surement to better than 10 % uncertainty. The Th/U
ratio is currently estimated from meteorites to be be-
tween 3.7 and 4.1. To do this measurement, the ¯νe energy
spectrum could be split into two regions, one between
2.5 MeV and 3.5 MeV, which contains only 238U ¯νe’s, and
the other between 1.5 MeV and 2.5 MeV. An exposure of
∼ 20 × 1032 target proton yr is required to measure the
ratio to 10 % accuracy. The uncertainty could be slightly
reduced by a full spectral shape analysis.

Assuming a 10% error in the commercial nuclear reac-
tor background, and only using the ¯νe spectrum above
4 MeV, the required exposure to observe a 6TW georeac-
tor at 3 sigma above zero is estimated to be ∼ 0.8 × 1032
target proton yr.

For a measurement of the total geoneutrino rate and
an observation of a hypothetical georeactor, we need an
exposure of about 2 × 1032 target proton yr. This could
be achieved in approximately four years assuming a sim-
ilar ﬁducial volume, 700 m3, and target proton density
to KamLAND[29]. A detector much larger than this is
not required, since this detector will already reach the
sensitivity imposed by the uncertainty in the neutrino
oscillation parameters. However, an accurate measure-

There are two main types of

large scintillator ¯νe
detectors: monolithic, such as the 1 kton KamLAND
detector[29]; and segmented, such as the 11 ton Palo
Verde detector[21]. The advantage of a monolithic de-
tector is reduced random coincidence backgrounds due
to reduced support material, which is typically harder
to purify than the scintillator. However, it would not be
possible to build a KamLAND shaped detector at Homes-
take mine without further excavation since the detector is
spherically symmetric. The advantage of a segmented de-
tector is it could be constructed in sections above ground
and transported below for assembly. Depending on the
segment size, it could also be placed in one of the larger
existing cavities.

In the KamLAND detector, the neutron produced in
the neutron inverse β decay is captured by a proton with
a mean capture time of ∼ 200 µs producing a 2.2 MeV
γ-ray. Gadolinium (Gd) was added to the Palo Verde de-
tector scintillator in order to reduce backgrounds. Neu-
tron capture by Gd produces γ-rays with a total energy
of ∼ 8 MeV, which is a higher energy than that pro-
duced by most radioactive backgrounds, greatly reducing
the accidental background. Additionally, the Gd neutron
capture cross-section is high, resulting in a mean neutron
capture time of only ∼ 27 µs in the Palo Verde detector,
which would further decrease the accidentals due to the
shorter correlation time window.

V. CONCLUSION

A measurement of geoneutrinos is an important step
in constraining our understanding of the Earth’s uranium
and thorium distributions. The heat from the decay of
these isotopes is the driving force for plate tectonics and
earthquakes, and this is the only technique that allows
us to directly observe these decays occurring at the in-
ner depths of the Earth. The KamLAND experiment[2]
has recently shown the viability of such a measurement;
however, it was limited by backgrounds from nearby nu-
clear power plants. A similar experiment at the Homes-
take mine does not have the same problem with nearby
nuclear power plants, and other backgrounds should be
small or negligible, but depend on the ﬁnal detector de-
sign.
It is envisioned that a detector could be located
in an existing cavity in the Homestake mine, such as the
one used by the Davis experiment[1].

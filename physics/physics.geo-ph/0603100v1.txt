In order to characterize landslide frequency-size distributions and individuate hazard scenarios
and their possible precursors, we investigate a cellular automaton where the eﬀects of a ﬁnite driving
rate and the anisotropy are taken into account. The model is able to reproduce observed features of
landslide events, such as power-law distributions, as experimentally reported. We analyze the key
role of the driving rate and show that, as it is increased, a crossover from power-law to non power-law
behaviors occurs. Finally, a systematic investigation of the model on varying its anisotropy factors
is performed and the full diagram of its dynamical behaviors is presented.

INTRODUCTION

Over the last two decades, the evidence of power laws
in frequency-size distributions of several natural hazards
such as earthquakes [1], volcanic eruptions [2], forest ﬁres
[3, 4, 5] and landslides [5, 6] has suggested a relationship
between these complex phenomena and self-organized
criticality (SOC) [7]. The idea of SOC [8], applied to
many media exhibiting avalanche dynamics [9, 10], refers
to the tendency of natural systems to self-organize into a
critical state where the distribution of event sizes is rep-
resented by a power law with an exponent α, which is
universal in the sense that it is robust to minor changes
in the system. Generally, the nature of a critical state is
evidenced by the fact that the size of a disturbance to the
system is a poor predictor of the system response. Let
us consider storms as perturbations for natural slopes.
Large storms can produce large avalanches, but also small
storms sometimes can do it. On the other hand, small
storms usually do not produce any avalanche, but also
large storms may not cause any avalanching phenomena.
Moreover, avalanches triggered by small storms can be
larger than those triggered by large storms. The un-
predictability of the sizes of such system responses to
incremental perturbations and the observed power-law
statistics could be the exhibition of self-organized criti-
cal behavior in most natural avalanches. However, the
idea of understanding power-law distributions within the
framework of SOC is not the only one. Recently, in or-
der to reproduce the range of the power-law exponents
observed for landslides, some authors have introduced a
two-threshold cellular automaton, which relates landslide
dynamics to the vicinity of a breakdown point rather than
to self-organization [11].

In this paper, we report an accurate investigation of a
cellular automaton model, which we have recently pro-
posed to describe landslide events and, speciﬁcally, their
frequency-size distributions [12].
In particular, we dis-
cuss the role of a ﬁnite driving rate and the anisotropy ef-
fects in our non-conservative system. It has been pointed
out by several authors that the driving rate is a parame-
ter that has to be ﬁne tuned to zero in order to observe
criticality [13, 14, 15]. We notice that the limit of zero

driving rate is only attainable in an ideal chain reaction,
therefore ﬁnite rates of external drives are essential ingre-
dients in the analysis of the dynamics of real avalanche
processes. We show that increasing the driving rate
the frequency-size distribution of landslide events evolves
continuously from a power-law (small driving rates) to
an exponential (Gaussian) function (large driving rates).
Interestingly, a crossover regime characterized by a max-
imum of the distribution at small sizes and a power-law
decay at medium and large sizes is found in the interme-
diate range of values of the driving rate for a wide range
of level of conservation. Power-law behaviors are robust
even though their exponents depend on the system pa-
rameters (e.g., driving rate and level of conservation, see
below).

Although the critical nature of landslides is not fully
assessed and many authors believe that deviations from
power law appear to be systematic for small landslides
data [16, 17], results from several regional landslide in-
ventories show robust power-law distributions of medium
and large events with a critical exponent α ∼ 2.5 ± 0.5
[6]. The variation in the exponents of landslide size dis-
tributions is larger than in the other natural hazards that
exhibit scale-invariant size statistics [18]. Whether this
variation of α is caused by scatter in the data or because
diﬀerent exponents are associated with diﬀerent geology,
is an important open question, which we may contribute
to address.

The model we analyze describes the evolution of a
space and time dependent factor of safety ﬁeld. The
factor of safety (F S) is deﬁned as the ratio between re-
sisting forces and driving forces. It is a complicate func-
tion of many dynamical variables (pore water pressure,
lithostatic stress, cohesion coeﬃcients, etc.) whose rate
of change is crucial in the characterization of landslide
events. A landslide event may include a single landslide
or many thousands. We investigate frequency-size dis-
tributions of landslide events by varying the driving rate
of the factor of safety. Although our probability den-
sity distributions are lacking of a direct comparison with
frequency-size distributions of real landslides they repro-
duce power-law scaling with an exponent very close to
the observed values. Moreover, they allow us to get in-

sight into the diﬃcult problem of the determination of
possible precursors of future events.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next Section,
we present the model and brieﬂy discuss the diﬀerences
between our approach and previous cellular automata
models that have been recently introduced to character-
ize landslide frequency-size distributions. In Section III,
we report numerical results obtained by a systematic in-
vestigation of the eﬀects of a ﬁnite driving rate on the
frequency-size distribution. The values of the exponent
of the power-law decay are given as a function of the
driving rate and the level of conservation. An accurate
analysis of the spatial distribution of the values of the fac-
tor of safety by varying the driving rate provides useful
information for quantifying hazard scenarios of possible
avalanche events. In Section IV, we analyze the role of
anisotropic transfer coeﬃcients, which control the prop-
agation of the instability. We summarize our results in
a phase diagram that shows the location of power-law
and non power-law scaling regions in the anisotropy pa-
rameter space. Conclusions are summarized in Section
V.

II. THE MODEL

The instability in clays often starts from a small region,
destabilizes the neighborhood and then propagates [19].
Such a progressive slope failure recalls the spreading of
avalanches in the fundamental models of SOC. The term
self-organized criticality (SOC) was coined by Bak, Tang
and Wiesenfeld to describe the phenomenon observed in a
particular cellular automaton model, nowadays known as
the sandpile model [8]. In the original sandpile model, the
system is perturbed externally by a random addition of
sand grains. Once the slope between two contiguous cells
has reached a threshold value, a ﬁxed amount of sand is
transferred to its neighbors generating a chain reaction
or avalanche. The non-cumulative number of avalanches
NA with area A satisﬁes a power-law distribution with
a critical exponent α = 1 [20], which is much smaller
than the values of the power-law exponents observed for
landslides [5, 6]. Few years later the paper of Bak et al.
[8], Olami, Feder and Christensen (OFC) recognized the
dynamics of earthquakes as a physical realization of self-
organized criticality and introduced a cellular automaton
that gives a good prediction of the Gutenberg-Richter law
[1]. Such a model, whose physical background belongs to
the Burridge-Knopoﬀ spring-block model [21], is based
on a continuous dynamical variable which increases uni-
formly through time till reaches a given threshold and re-
laxes. This means that the dynamical variable decreases,
while a part of the loss is transferred to the nearest neigh-
bors. If this transfer causes one of the neighbors to reach
the threshold value, it relaxes too, resulting in a chain
reaction. OFC recognized that the model still exhibits
power-law scaling in the non-conservative regime, even if
the power-law exponent strongly depends on the level of

2

(1)

conservation.

In this paper, we investigate the role of a ﬁnite driv-
ing rate and of anisotropy in a non-conservative cellular
automaton modeling landslides [12]. In such a model, we
sketch a natural slope by using a square grid where each
site i is characterized by a local value of the safety factor
F Si. In slope stability analysis, the factor of safety, F S,
against slip is deﬁned in terms of the ratio of the maxi-
mum shear strength τmax to the disturbing shear stress
τ

F S =

τmax
τ

.

The limited amount of stress that a site can support is
given by the empirical Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion:
τmax = c + (σ − u) tan φ, where σ is the total normal
stress, u is the pore-ﬂuid pressure, φ is the angle of in-
ternal friction of the soil and c is the cohesional (non-
frictional) component of the soil strength [22]. If F S > 1,
resisting forces exceed driving forces and the slope re-
mains stable. Slope failure starts when F S = 1. Since
a natural slope is a complex non-homogeneous system
characterized by the presence of composite diﬀusion, dis-
sipative and driving mechanisms acting in the soil (such
as those on the water content), we consider time and site
dependent safety factor F Si and treat the local inverse
factor of safety ei = 1/F Si as the non-conserved dynam-
ical variable of our cellular automata model [12].

The long-term driving of the OFC model is, here, re-
placed by a dynamical rule which causes the increases
of ei through the time with a ﬁnite driving rate ν:
ei(t+∆t) = ei(t)+ν∆t. Such a rule allows us to simulate
the eﬀect on the factor of safety of diﬀerent complex pro-
cesses which can change the state of stress of a cell. The
model is driven as long as ei < 1 on all sites i. Then,
when a site, say i, becomes unstable (i.e., exceeds the
threshold, eth = 1) it relaxes with its neighbors accord-
ing to the rule:

ei → 0;

enn → enn + fnnei,

(2)

where nn denotes the nearest neighbors of site i and fnn
is the fraction of ei toppling on nn. This relaxation rule
is considered to be instantaneous compared to the time
scale of the overall drive and lasts until all sites remain
below the threshold. When ei reaches the threshold value
1 and relaxes, the fraction of ei moving from the site i
to its “downward” (resp. “upward”) neighbor on the
square grid is fd (resp. fu), as fl = fr is the fraction
to each of its “left” and “right” neighbors. The trans-
fer parameters fnn are chosen in order to individuate a
privileged transfer direction: we assume fu < fd and
fl = fr < fd. We notice that the model reproduces fea-
tures of the OFC model for earthquakes in the limit case
ν = 0 and fnn = f ≤ 0.25. A detailed analysis of the
model on varying the transfer coeﬃcients fnn is reported
in Sec. IV.

Since many complex dissipative phenomena (such
as evaporation mechanism, volume contractions, etc.

transfer

[23]) contribute to a dissipative stress
in
gravity-driven failures, we study the model in the non-
conservative case C = Pnn fnn < 1, which makes our
approach diﬀerent from previous ones within the frame-
work of SOC [18]. The conservation level, C, and the
anisotropy factors, which we consider here to be uni-
form, are actually related to local soil properties (e.g.,
lithostatic, frictional and cohesional properties), as well
as to the local geometry of the slope (e.g., its morphol-
ogy). The rate of change of the inverse factor of safety,
ν, induced by the external drive (e.g., rainfall), in turn
related to soil and slope properties, quantiﬁes how the
triggering mechanisms aﬀect the time derivative of the
FS ﬁeld.

Recently, in order to reproduce the range of the power-
law exponents observed for landslides, several authors
have used two-threshold cellular automata, which re-
late landslide dynamics to self-organization [24] or to the
vicinity of a breakdown point [11]. In the ﬁrst approach
[24], a time-dependent criterion for stability, with a not
easy interpretation in terms of governing physics, pro-
vides a power-law exponent close to 2 without any tuning.
Therefore, this approach does not explain the observed
variability of α.
[11], the range of α is found
by tuning the maximum value of the ratio between the
thresholds of two failure modes, the shear failure and
the slab failure. However, the frequency-size distribu-
tion of avalanches is obtained by counting only clusters
where shear failures have occurred, considering conserva-
tive transfer processes between adjacent cells with a dif-
ferent number of nearest neighbors. In this paper, the in-
vestigation of our non-conservative cellular automaton is
mainly devoted to the characterization of landslide event
dynamics on varying the driving rate in order to analyze
diﬀerent hazard scenarios.

III. THE EFFECT OF A FINITE DRIVE ON
FREQUENCY-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS

Frequency-size distributions give the number of land-
slides (events) as a function of their size. In Fig.1 we show
the non-cumulative frequency-size distributions obtained
for diﬀerent values of the driving rate in the anisotropic
non conservative case C = 0.4, with fu/fd = 2/3 and
fl/fd = 5/6. The curves are obtained for a square lat-
tice of size 64 × 64. We considered both cylindrical (open
along the vertical axis and periodical along the horizontal
axis) and open boundary conditions, which we checked
diﬀer in the slopes of the distribution curves for less than
1%.

In the limit of vanishing driving rate, the distribution
of events, P (s), is similar to that of the two-dimensional
isotropic OFC model for a ﬁxed value of the level of con-
servation: a power law characterized by a critical expo-
nent α, P (s) ∼ s−α, followed by a system ﬁnite-size de-
pendent exponential cutoﬀ [9]. As discussed in Ref. [12],
by increasing the driving rate ν, the probability distri-

events with ν. On the left side of the maximum, a power-
law decay, with exponent β (see the Fig. 1), seems to ap-
pear for small landslide sizes. However, the few available
data do not allow to distinguish log-log linear shape and
an exponential one [17]. On the right side of the maxi-
mum of the distribution, the power-law regime remains

until, by increasing ν, the distribution continuously mod-
iﬁes in a bell-shaped curve. Fig.2 shows the crossover of
the probability distribution from power-law to Gaussian
on increasing the driving rate.

The behavior of the power-law exponents on varying ν
is shown in Fig.3. Interestingly, the values of the power-
law exponent α are very close to those experimentally
reported [5]. As one can see, α increases until the value
of the driving rate sensitively modiﬁes the shape of the
distribution with the appearance of a maximum. We
ﬁnd that the regime with a non-monotonic frequency-size
distribution is robust to changes in system parameters.

In particular, it can be found for ν ∈ [10−4, 10−2] in the
whole range C ∈ [0.4, 0.8].

The values of the exponents α and β sensitively change
by varying another important parameter of the model
that is the level of conservation C, which represents the
non-conservative redistribution of the load of failing cells.
The eﬀect of C at ﬁnite driving rate is comparable to that
obtained at ν = 0 [1], as shown in Fig.4 (see also Ref.
[12]).

Let us come back to Fig.1 in order to highlight the
role of the driving rate in the characterization of land-
slide events. From the distributions of Fig.1, we see that
large events can have comparatively high probabilities in
the power-law regime (i.e., at small driving rates ν) with
respect to the Gaussian regime (i.e., larger ν). Such a fea-
ture could allow to reproduce the observation that some-
times mild rainfalls produce landslides as large as those

triggered by intense rainfalls. To underline the nonlinear
behavior of the system with ν, in Fig.5 we plot the sizes
of avalanches with the same probability of occurrence for
diﬀerent values of the driving rate. Such sizes are the in-
tersections of horizontal straight lines with the distribu-
tion curves of Fig.1. When we consider small events (i.e.,
P (s) as large as 10−2), we ﬁnd that the size of equiprob-
able events increases with the driving rate. Thus, for
equiprobable events with high probability of occurrence
the system response is essentially linear with the driv-
ing rate. Instead, for large events (i.e., P (s) as small as
10−6), the size of equiprobable events has a maximum as
a function of ν. Thus, it appears that, for a given range
of ν values, the size of events caused by a slow rate of
changes of the factor of safety can be larger than the size
of avalanches triggered by a faster rate. Moreover, an
evidence is found for the existence of the most dangerous
value of ν, for which the size of the system response has
a maximum.

A. Hazards scenarios

The detection of possible precursors of a landslide
event is a crucial step to achieve hazard reduction. In
order to get insight into this diﬃcult problem, we visual-
ize the structure of a typical landslide event for diﬀerent
values of the driving rate ν.
In the top row of Fig.6,
we report on the 64 × 64 grid a typical avalanche of size
s = 230 on increasing the value of ν from left to right.
The 230 black cells are those that have reached the in-
stability threshold. As we can see, compact landslides
are the characteristic response of a system governed by
power-law statistics as it happens at small ν (also when
a maximum in the frequency-size distribution develops).
Such a response is typical of systems with SOC behav-
ior [26]. By increasing the driving rate, compact clusters
survive until power-law regime disappears. As the sys-
tem enters the non power-law regime, the relevance of
domino eﬀects drastically drops and landslide events are
characterized by many tiny independent clusters.

In the bottom row of Fig.6, we show the distribution of
the factor of safety F Si = 1/ei for the cases correspond-
ing to the upper panels [25]. The distribution on the
grid of the values shows how the spatial correlations in
the system crucially aﬀect landslide structures. In order
to measure the distance of a cell from its instability con-
dition and to visualize the correlated areas (regions with
similar values of F Si), the values of F Si have been asso-
ciated to ten levels of a gray scale from white to black:

the darker the color, the farther is the cell from the insta-
bility threshold. In the snapshots of Fig.6, it is possible
to recognize as dark areas the avalanches shown in the
corresponding upper grids. In particular, the dark areas
typically are related to previous landslide events, whereas
the lighter areas indicate regions of future events. We
notice that in the power law regime (i.e. small ν) even
a very small perturbation (say, a drop of water) at one
single point can trigger huge system responses. Instead,
in the non power-law regime (i.e.
large ν) large-scale
correlations are absent; here large events trivially occur
just because the strong external driving rate makes likely
that many cells simultaneously approach the instability
threshold. Thus, the detection of patterns of correlated
domains in investigated areas results to be a crucial tool
to identify the response of the system to perturbations,
i.e., to hazard assessment.

It is worth noticing that the average value of the fac-
tor of safety on the grid cells < F S > and its ﬂuctuation
< ∆F S2 > are very similar in the four cases showed in
Fig.6, encompassing a broad spectrum of ν values. Inter-
estingly, the probability distribution of F S on the grid
sites, independently of the driving rate, is well approxi-
mated by a Gaussian distribution. This suggests that a
measure of just an average safety factor on the investi-
gated area could provide only a very partial information
about the statistics governing the considered landslide
events.

IV. ANISOTROPY EFFECTS ON
FREQUENCY-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS

In the previous sections, we have investigated the prop-
erties of the model on varying the driving rate ν at ﬁxed
values of the anisotropic ratios fu/fd and fl/fd = fr/fd.
Such parameters control how the instability propagates
downward and, therefore, they are complicate functions
of the topography and geology of a speciﬁc area. In this
Section, we are interested in the analysis of the model
when such transfer coeﬃcients vary.

It is well-known that the one-dimensional version of
the sandpile and OFC models are characterized by non
power-law scaling [9]. Thus, we expect that, for small val-
ues of the ratio fl/fd, the frequency-size distribution does
not show power-law behavior. Viceversa, for fu/fd ∼ 1
and fl/fd ∼ 1, we expect to have power-law distribu-
tions, as in the OFC model, which corresponds in our
model to the limit f = fu = fl = fr = fd and ν = 0.

(γ = 0 for a uniform driving), for large values of the level
of conservation, C ≥ 0.6, the peaks disappear and they
get a power-law decay with an exponential cutoﬀ. Con-
versely, we ﬁnd commensurate peaks in the FSO region
in the whole range C ∈ [0.4, 0.8].

We notice that an analysis of the anisotropic case of
the OFC model is made in Ref.[27] where the authors
introduce only two transfer coeﬃcients α1 = fl = fr and
α2 = fu = fd and control the degree of anisotropy by

found in our simulations at ﬁxed values of the driving
rate ν = 10−4 and the level of conservation C = 0.4. We
ﬁnd that, on varying the anisotropic ratios, the parame-
ter space is divided in three regions: i) a power-law region
(PL) characterized by power-law frequency-size distribu-
tions for large values of the anisotropic ratios, ii) a non
power-law region (NPL) for the whole range of values of
the anisotropic ratio fu/fd (which controls the redistri-
bution of load in the vertical direction) and small values
of fl/fd, iii) a ﬁnite-size oscillation region (FSO) where
the frequency-size distribution is characterized by peri-
odic peaks, which appear for integer multiples of the grid
size L = 64.

As expected, we ﬁnd power-law and non power-law
behaviors for large and small values of the anisotropic
ratios, respectively. In particular, we ﬁnd that the value
of the critical exponent α of the power-law distribution
slightly increases with fu/fd for a ﬁxed value of fl/fd and
decreases with fl/fd for a ﬁxed value of fu/fd. However,
the changes in α are negligible.

It is worth noticing that, even if the ratio fl/fd is quite
large, we ﬁnd that the frequency-size distribution does
not show a power law decay when the value of fu/fd is
small, (see Fig.7).
Indeed, the probability distribution
develops a ﬁnite number of peaks which are commensu-
rate with the size of the grid. Fig.8 shows the frequency-
size distribution for two diﬀerent values of the anisotropic
ratios in the FSO region of the phase diagram. By in-
creasing fl/fd, the peaks of the distributions turn down
as long as they disappear. We m that several peaks in the
distribution of avalanche sizes are obtained in Ref. [28].
The authors vary the convexity of the driving γ and the
level of conservation ǫ in the isotropic case: C = 1 when
ǫ = 0.25. They ﬁnd an intermediate region of the phase-

changing the ratio α1/α2, while keeping the level of con-
servation constant. They ﬁnd that the anisotropy has
almost no eﬀect on the power-law exponent while the
scaling exponent, expressing how the ﬁnite-size cutoﬀ
scales with the system size, changes continuously from
a two-dimensional to a one dimensional scaling of the
avalanches [27]. Varying the anisotropic ratio α1/α2 in
the range [0, 1] is equivalent to consider the straight line
fu/fd = 1 in the phase diagram of Fig.7. As in Ref. [27],
we ﬁnd that on moving along the line fu/fd = 1, the
changes in the power-law exponent are negligible. How-
[27], we ﬁnd a crossover in the
ever, diﬀerently Ref.
frequency-size distribution behavior from power-law to
non power-law (see Fig. 9). We attribute such a diﬀer-
ent result to the ﬁnite driving rate.

In conclusion, our analysis shows that only a ﬁnite
range of values of the anisotropic transfer coeﬃcients
can supply power-law distributions. This characteriza-
tion provides insight into the diﬃcult determination of
the complex and non-linear transfer processes that occur
in a landslide event.

tomaton based on a dissipative factor of safety ﬁeld. We
have found that the value of the driving rate, which de-
scribes the variation rate of the factor of safety due to
external perturbations, has a crucial role in determining
landslide statistics. In particular, we have shown that, as
the driving rate increases, the frequency-size distribution
continuously changes from power-law to gaussian shapes,
oﬀering the possibility to explain the observed rollover of
the data for small landslides. The values of the calcu-
lated power-law exponents are in good agreement with
the observed values. Moreover, the analysis of the model
on varying the driving rate suggests the determination
of correlated spatial domains of the factor of safety as
a useful tool to quantify the severity of future landslide
events.

As concerns the eﬀects of anisotropic transfer coef-
ﬁcients, which control the non-conservative redistribu-
tion of the load of failing cells, we have found that the
power-law behavior of the frequency-size distribution is
a feature of the model only in a limited region of the
anisotropy parameter space.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Acknowledgments

Explanation of the power-law statistics for landslides is
a major challenge, both from a theoretical point of view
as well as for hazard assessment. In order to characterize
frequency-size distributions of landslide events, we have
investigated a continuously driven anisotropic cellular au-

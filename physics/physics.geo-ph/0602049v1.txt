Neutrino tomography
Learning about the Earth’s interior using the
propagation of neutrinos

Received:

Abstract Because the propagation of neutrinos is aﬀected by the presence
of Earth matter, it opens new possibilities to probe the Earth’s interior.
Diﬀerent approaches range from techniques based upon the interaction of
high energy (above TeV) neutrinos with Earth matter, to methods using the
MSW eﬀect on the neutrino oscillations of low energy (MeV to GeV) neu-
trinos. In principle, neutrinos from many diﬀerent sources (sun, atmosphere,
supernovae, beams etc.) can be used. In this talk, we summarize and com-
pare diﬀerent approaches with an emphasis on more recent developments. In
addition, we point out other geophysical aspects relevant for neutrino oscil-
lations.

1 Introduction

Walter Winter

Neutrinos are elementary particles coming in three active (i.e., weakly in-
teracting) ﬂavors. Since the cross sections for neutrino interactions are very
small, neutrinos practically penetrate everything. However, one can com-
pensate for these tiny cross sections by just using enough material in the
detector. Depending on neutrino energy and source, the detector has to be
protected from backgrounds such that the neutrino events cannot be easily
mixed up with diﬀerent particle interactions. Neutrinos are produced in de-
tectable numbers and with detectable energies by nuclear reactions in the
sun, by cosmic ray interactions in the Earth’s atmosphere, in nuclear ﬁssion
reactors, in supernova explosions, in the Earth’s crust, and possibly by astro-
physical sources. In addition, accelerator-based neutrino sources speciﬁcally
designed to produce a high-intensity neutrino beam have been successfully
operated (such as K2K [6] or MINOS) or are planned. Thus, there are neu-
trinos from various diﬀerent sources with diﬀerent energies.

One of the most recent exciting discoveries in neutrino physics are neu-
trino oscillations, i.e., neutrinos change ﬂavor while traveling from source to
detector. This quantum mechanical phenomenon implies that neutrinos mix,
i.e., the eigenstates of the weak interaction are not the same as the mass
eigenstates, and at least two out of the three have non-vanishing masses.
This is probably the most direct evidence today for physics beyond the stan-
dard model of elementary particle physics. Recent neutrino oscillation ex-
periments, especially SNO [1], KamLAND [18], Super-Kamiokande [24], and
CHOOZ [7] have helped to quantify this picture. Unlike in quark mixing, two
out of the three mixing angles are large, and one is even close to maximal. In
addition, the oscillation frequencies have been fairly precisely measured. For
one of the mixing angles θ13, however, only an upper bound exists, and several
parameters (the arrangement of masses, i.e., mass hierarchy, and one com-
plex phase δCP relevant for neutrino oscillations) are still unknown. Future
experiments will probe these parameters starting with the Double Chooz [9],
T2K [40], and NOνA [11] experiments (for the prospects for the next decade,
see, e.g., Ref. [35]).

For neutrino tomography the relevant aspect is the sensitivity to Earth
matter. Since it is well known that the cross sections with matter rise at least
until 10 TeV [58], the probability of matter interactions can be increased by
higher neutrino energies. Neutrino absorption tomography uses this eﬀect to
infer on the matter structure. For neutrino oscillations, we know that the so-
called MSW matter eﬀect [66; 48; 49] is the most plausible explanation for the
solar neutrino deﬁcit [21]. This, however, implies that neutrino oscillation in
the Earth have to experience this eﬀect, too. Neutrino oscillation tomography
uses the MSW eﬀect to study the matter structure.

2 Tomography using the propagation of neutrinos

Tomography using the propagation of neutrinos assumes a neutrino source
with a well-known ﬂux and ﬂavor composition, a well-understood neutrino

detector, and a speciﬁc neutrino propagation model between source and de-
tector. The key ingredient to any such tomography is a considerable depen-
dence of the propagation model on the matter structure between source and
detector. Compared to the detection of geoneutrinos, the object of interest
is not the neutrino source, but the material long the baseline (path between
source and detector). If the matter structure along the baseline is (partly)
unknown, the information from counting neutrino events at diﬀerent ener-
gies by the detector can be used to infer on the matter proﬁle. Two accepted
propagation models could be used for neutrino tomography:
Neutrino absorption: Because the cross section for neutrino interactions in-
creases proportional to the energy, neutrino interactions lead to atten-
uation eﬀects. Useful neutrino energies for a signiﬁcant attenuation are
Eν & 1 TeV.

Neutrino oscillations: The MSW eﬀect [66; 48; 49] in neutrino oscillations
(coherent forward scattering in matter) leads to a relative phase shift of
the electron ﬂavor compared to the muon and tau ﬂavors. This phase
shift depends on the electron density. Useful neutrino energies require
substantial contributions from the MSW eﬀect as well as large enough
oscillation amplitudes. Depending the relevant ∆m2, neutrino energies
between 100 MeV and 35 GeV are optimal for studying the Earth’s inte-
rior.

Beyond these two models, at least small ad-mixtures of non-standard eﬀects
have not yet been excluded. Some of these non-standard eﬀects are sensi-
tive to the matter density, too. Examples are mass-varying neutrinos with
acceleron couplings to matter ﬁelds [43], non-standard neutrino interactions
(see Ref. [34] and references therein), and matter-induced (fast) neutrino de-
cay [28]. Because there is not yet any evidence for such eﬀects, we do not
include them in this discussion.

Given the above neutrino energies, there are a number of potential sources
which could be used for neutrino propagation tomography. For neutrino oscil-
lations, solar neutrinos, supernova neutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos, and neu-
trino beams (such as superbeams or neutrino factories) are potential sources.
For neutrino absorption, high-energy atmospheric neutrinos, a possible high-
energy neutrino beam, or cosmic sources are possible sources.

As far as potential geophysics applications are concerned, neutrinos may

be interesting for several reasons:
1. Neutrinos propagate on straight lines. The uncertainty in their path (di-

rection) is only as big as the surface area of the detector.

2. Neutrinos are sensitive to complementary quantities to geophysics: Neu-
trino absorption is directly sensitive to the matter density via the nucleon
density. Neutrino oscillations are sensitive to the electron density which
can be converted in the matter density by the number of electrons per
nucleon (for stable “heavy” materials about two). On the other hand,
seismic wave geophysics needs to reconstruct the matter density by the
equation of state from the propagation velocity proﬁle.

3. Neutrinos are, in principle, sensitive to the density averaged over the
baseline, whereas other geophysics techniques are, in principle, less sensi-
tive towards the innermost parts of the Earth. For example, seismic shear

4

waves cannot propagate within the outer liquid core, which means that a
substantial fraction of the energy deposited in seismic waves is reﬂected
at the mantle-core boundary. Other direct density measurements by the
Earth’s mass or rotational inertia are less sensitive towards the innermost
parts, too, because they measure volume-averaged quantities.

Given these observations, there may be interesting geophysics applications
exactly where complementary information is needed. Possible applications
range from the detection of density contrasts in the Earth’s upper or lower
mantle, to the measurement of the average densities of the outer and inner
core by independent methods.

3 Neutrino absorption tomography

Here we discuss tomography based on attenuation eﬀects in a neutrino ﬂux
of high enough energies, which we call, for simplicity, “neutrino absorption
tomography”. After we have introduced the principles, we will discuss pos-
sible applications with respect to tomography of the whole Earth as well as
speciﬁc sites.

3.1 Principles

“Neutrino absorption tomography” uses the attenuation of a high-energy
neutrino ﬂux as a propagation model. In this case, weak interactions damp the
initial ﬂux by the integrated eﬀect of absorption, deﬂection, and regeneration.
For example, muons produced by a muon neutrino interaction are absorbed
very quickly in Earth matter, whereas tauons produced by tau neutrinos
tend to decay before absorption (and some of the decay products are again
neutrinos). Only the integrated eﬀect leads to attenuation of the ﬂux. The
magnitude of the attenuation eﬀect can be estimated from the cross section

σ
E ∼

TeV

(1)

to be of the order of several per cent over the Earth’s diameter for Eν =
1 TeV. The interaction cross section rises linearly up to about 10 TeV [58],
whereas the behavior above these energies is somewhat more speculative. The
energies are usually as high as standard neutrino oscillations do not develop
within the Earth. Since the neutrinos interact with nucleons, the attenuation
is directly proportional to the nucleon density. Therefore, neutrino absorp-
tion is a very directly handle on the matter density with an extremely tiny
remaining uncertainty from composition and the diﬀerence between neutron
and proton mass.

As far as possible potential neutrino sources are concerned, Eq. (1) re-
quires very high neutrino energies. The existence of corresponding neutrino
sources is plausible and will be tested by upcoming experiments commonly
referred to as “neutrino telescopes”. These neutrino telescopes could also

serve as prototypes for the detectors useful for neutrino absorption tomogra-
phy. The only detected source so far are atmospheric neutrinos produced by
the interaction of cosmic rays in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the atmo-
spheric neutrino ﬂux drops rapidly with energy, which means that statistics
is limited at the relevant energies Eν > 1 TeV (see, e.g., Ref. [29] for speciﬁc
values). Other potential candidates include many diﬀerent possible astro-
physics objects, as well as particle physics mechanisms such as decays of
dark matter particles. Since we know that the Earth is hit by cosmic rays of
very high energies, it might be inferred that astrophysical mechanisms exist
which accelerate particles (for example, protons) to these high energies. It
is plausible that such mechanisms also produce neutrinos. Potential mecha-
nisms could either produce discrete ﬂuxes from individual objects, or their
integrated eﬀect could lead to a diﬀuse ﬂux over the whole sky. Eventually,
one could think about a neutrino beam producing high-energy neutrinos. If,
for instance, one used the protons from LHC (7 TeV) to hit a target, the
decaying secondaries (pions, kaons) would produce a neutrino ﬂux peaking
at about 1 TeV.

3.2 Whole Earth tomography

For possible applications of neutrino absorption tomography, there exist two
diﬀerent directions in the literature: Either one could “X-ray” the whole
Earth (“Whole Earth tomography”), or one could think about the investiga-
tion of speciﬁc sites in the Earth’s mantle. We summarize in Fig. 1 diﬀerent
approaches to “Whole Earth tomography”. In case a) (isotropic ﬂux) a neu-
trino ﬂux from many directions is detected by a detector with good directional
resolution. For instance, a possible neutrino source would be a cosmic diﬀuse
ﬂux [42] (related work: Ref. [59]) or the high-energy tail of atmospheric neu-
trinos (see, e.g., Ref. [29]). This application could be very interesting because
it might be available at no additional experimental eﬀort. However, if one
wants to study the innermost parts of the Earth, it is (except from suﬃcient
directional resolution and ﬂux isotropy) a major challenge that the fraction

of the sky which is seen through the Earth’s inner core is very small (
1%),
which means that the statistics for this speciﬁc goal is very low. Very good
precisions may, on the other hand, be obtained for the mantle (see Fig. 4
of Ref. [42]). In case b) (high-energy neutrino beam) [17; 62; 10; 14; 13] the
detector is moved to obtain many baselines, whereas the source is kept ﬁx. In
this case, high precisions could be obtained [17]. However, a major challenge
might actually be the operation of a high-energy neutrino beam with a mov-
ing decay tunnel. Note that such a beam could not only be used for whole
Earth tomography, but also for local searches (see below). In case c) (cosmic
point source) [62; 45], the ﬂux from a single object is used for the tomography
of the Earth. In this case, the ﬂux has to be constant in time to be detected
either by a moving detector, or by one detector using many baselines by the
rotation of the Earth. Note that the second mechanism cannot be used for
the currently largest planned neutrino telescope “IceCube” [2] because it is
residing at the south pole.

3.3 Speciﬁc site tomography

Compared to “whole Earth tomography”, a diﬀerent direction is the investi-
gation of individual sites, such as in the Earth’s mantle. For example, Ref. [17]
extensively reviews techniques based on a high-energy neutrino beam. We
summarize some of those in Fig. 2. The neutrinos, produced by the source
“S”, may interact at several possible interaction points IP . If, for example,
the site of interest is the dark-shaded cavity, an interaction at IP1 could
create a particle shower leading to sound production, which may be detected
by a microphone array at the surface. In addition, the ﬁnal neutrino ﬂux
detected at “D” would be damped depending on the material density in the
cavity. An interaction at IP2 just below the surface (. 200 m) would pro-
duce muons which could still be detected at the surface (such as possibly by
a muon detector on a truck). A variation of this ﬂux detected by a moving
muon detector could point towards heavy materials. Eventually, a neutrino
interaction at IP3 within the sea water below a muon moving detector would
indicate that the initial neutrino has arrived. Since the neutrino energy de-
creases rapidly by moving the detector out of the beam axis by kinematics,
attenuation eﬀects also decrease and the initial ﬂux could be measured by
the “oﬀ-axis” technology. Comparing this ﬂux to the on-axis ﬂux reveals the

Neutrino tomography

attenuation along the path and therefore some information on the matter
structure.

In summary, there are many potential applications of neutrino absorp-
tion tomography. The coming years, especialy the operation of IceCube, will
reveal the possible existence of high-energy cosmic neutrino ﬂuxes. Operat-
ing a high-energy neutrino beam may be a major technical challenge, which
deﬁnitively needs further investigation.

4 Neutrino oscillation tomography

In this section, we discuss neutrino tomography using oscillations. First, we
introduce the principles of neutrino oscillation tomography: Neutrino oscil-
lations in vacuum and matter, numerical approaches to neutrino oscillation
tomography, as well as conceptual (mathematical) problems. Then, we show
applications related to solar and supernova neutrinos, and we discuss tomog-
raphy with neutrino beams.

4.1 Principles

Neutrino oscillation tomography uses neutrino oscillations in matter as prop-
agation model. Possible neutrino sources include “natural” ones (e.g., sun,
supernova, atmosphere), as well as “man-made” ones (e.g., superbeam, β-
beam, neutrino factory). The detection technology depends on the neutrino
energy and ranges from Water Cherenkov detectors (lower energies), over
liquid scintillators (medium energies), to iron calorimeters (high energies),
just to mention some examples.

Neutrino oscillation phenomenon

Neutrino oscillations are a quantum mechanical phenomenon with two pre-
requisites: First, the weak interaction eigenstates have to be diﬀerent from the
propagation/mass eigenstates (ﬂavor mixing). Second, the neutrino masses
have to be diﬀerent from each other, which implies that at least two of the
active neutrinos have to have non-zero mass [12]. In the limit of two ﬂavors,
the ﬂavor transition probability να

νβ in vacuum can be written as

the complete picture is somewhat more complicated. Three-ﬂavor neutrino
oscillations can be described by six parameters (three mixing angles, one
complex phase, and two mass squared diﬀerences), which decouple into two-
ﬂavor oscillations, described by two parameters each, in certain limits (see
Ref. [23] for a recent review). In summary, we have two almost decoupled
two-ﬂavor oscillations described by two very diﬀerent frequencies and large
mixing angles, often referred two as “solar” (∆m2
21, θ12) and “atmospheric”
(∆m2
31, θ23) oscillations. Those could be coupled by θ13, for which so far
only an upper bound sin2(2θ13) . 0.1 [7] exists. In addition, we do not
yet know anything about the complex phase δCP, which could lead to sub-
leading eﬀects, and the sign of ∆m2
31 (“mass hierarchy”). These parameters
will be probed by neutrino oscillation experiments in the coming years. In
this section, we concentrate on the two-ﬂavor case for pedagogical reasons.

Matter eﬀects in neutrino oscillations

Key ingredient to neutrino tomography are matter eﬀects in neutrino oscil-
lations [66; 48; 49]. Since Earth matter contains plenty of electrons, but no
muons or tauons, charged-current interactions of the electron neutrino ﬂavor
through coherent forwards scattering lead to a relative phase shift compared
to the muon and tau neutrino ﬂavors. In the Hamiltonian in two ﬂavors, the
matter term enters as the second term in

√2GF ne is the matter potential as function
in ﬂavor space, where A(ne) =
of the electron density ne and the coupling constant GF , and the diﬀerent
signs refer to neutrinos (plus) and antineutrinos (minus). Assuming that the
number of electrons per nucleon is approximately 0.5 for stable “heavy” (con-
siderably heavier than hydrogen) materials, the electron density can be con-
verted into the matter density as ne = 0.5 ρ/mN with mN the nucleon mass.
In this case, there is some material dependence of this factor 0.5 (“electron
fraction”), which, however, might also be used to obtain additional infor-
mation on the composition. In two ﬂavors and for constant matter density,
Eq. (2) can be easily re-written by a parameter mapping between vacuum
and matter parameters:

be constant.

One can easily read oﬀ these formulas that for ˆA
cos(2θ) the parameter
ξ in Eq. (6) becomes minimal, which means that the oscillation frequency
in matter becomes minimal and the eﬀective mixing maximal (cf., Eq. (5)).
This case is often referred to as “matter resonance”, where the condition

If the neutrino energy is far out of this range, either the matter eﬀects or
the overall event rate from oscillations will be strongly suppressed. However,
there are also possible applications. Since, for instance, for solar neutrinos

Eres, one can use the absence of the resonance for analytical simpliﬁca-
tions, as we will discuss later.

Numerical evaluation and conceptual problems

In order to numerically study neutrino oscillation tomography, a commonly
used method is the “evolution operator method” (cf., e.g., Ref. [52]). This
method assumes that the matter density proﬁle be discretized into layers
with constant density (cf., Fig. 3 for an example). The initial state
is
then propagated through the diﬀerent matter density layers with depths xj

which means that the evolution operators of diﬀerent layers do not necessarily
commute. This already implies that the information from a single baseline
must be somehow sensitive towards the arrangement of the matter density
layers. This is very diﬀerent from X-ray or neutrino absorption tomography
which do not have positional information from one baseline.

An important conceptual problem in neutrino oscillation tomography is
the matter proﬁle inversion problem [19; 20]. Assume that a matter density
proﬁle such as in Fig. 3 is given. For a speciﬁc experiment setup, it is then
fairly easy to compute the corresponding transition probabilities or event
rates as function of energy. However, the reverse problem is theoretically
generally unsolved: Assume that the transition probability is known up to
inﬁnite energies, then it would be very useful to be able to compute the
matter proﬁle from that. So far, there have been several attempts to solve
this problem using simpliﬁcations, such as

– Simple models using only very few discrete steps (see, e.g., Refs. [50; 51;

54])

– Linearization in a low density medium (solar, supernova neutrinos) [4]
– Discretization of a more complex proﬁle using non-deterministic algo-

rithms to ﬁt a large number of parameters [53].

Below, we will discuss some of these approaches in greater detail.

4.2 Neutrino oscillation tomography with solar and supernova neutrinos

Solar and supernova neutrinos are theoretically very interesting for neutrino
tomography because matter eﬀects are introduced oﬀ the resonance in Earth

matter, i.e., the neutrino energy E
21),
or equivalently ˆA
1. This means that one does not expect strong matter
eﬀects in Earth matter as opposed to within the sun. However, this limit
is theoretically very useful to study tomography because it allows for per-
turbation theory and other simpliﬁed approaches. It is often referred to as
neutrino oscillations in a “low density medium” [38; 39] because the density
in the Earth is much lower than in the sun.

Detecting a cavity

We show in Fig. 4 a possible setup for neutrino tomography using solar neu-
trinos following Ref. [37]. In this setup, the detector is ﬁxed while the Earth is
rotating, which means that the cavity with density ρ is “exposed” (in line of
sight sun-detector) a time 0 < texp < 24 hr per day. The change in the oscilla-
tion probability during this time is, depending on geometry and density con-
trast, . 0.1%. This leads to a required detector mass M & 130 Mt/(texp[hr]),
which has a lower limit of 5 Mt at the poles. Thus, from the statistics point
of view, this approach is very challenging, and backgrounds might be an im-
portant issue. In addition, for such large detectors, the detector surface area
might be of the order of the cavity size. There are, however, interesting the-
oretical results from such a discussion. Let us deﬁne the oscillation phases in
the individual steps x1, d, and x2 as [37]

with the corresponding matter potentials ˆAi (cf., Fig. 4). One can show that
if mass eigenstates arrive at the surface of the Earth (solar and supernova
neutrinos), the change in probability ∆P (cavity exposed-not exposed) only
depends on Φ2, but not on Φ1. In addition, there is a damping of contributions
from remote distances x2, which means that solar neutrinos are less sensitive
to the deep interior of the Earth than to structures close to the detector.

Matter density inversion problem

A further application of the low density limit is to theoretically solve the
matter proﬁle inversion problem. Following Ref. [4], the Earth matter eﬀect
on solar or supernova neutrinos is fully encoded in the quantity (“day-night
regeneration eﬀect”)

and the matter density proﬁle inversion problem is solved. One problem is
very obvious from Eq. (18): One needs to know f (δ) in the whole interval
0
which is practically impossible. The authors of Ref. [4] suggest
an iteration method to solve this problem. Additional challenges are statis-
tics and a ﬁnite energy resolution, which is “washing out” the edges in the
proﬁle. One interesting advantage of using solar or supernova neutrinos is
the sensitivity to asymmetric proﬁles, i.e., for mass-ﬂavor oscillations there
is no degeneracy between one proﬁle and the time-inverted version, which
otherwise (for ﬂavor-ﬂavor oscillations) can only be resolved by suppressed
three-ﬂavor eﬀects.

Supernova neutrinos to spy on the Earth’s core

Unlike solar neutrinos, which are limited to energies below 20 MeV, supernova
neutrinos from a possible galactic supernova explosion have a high-energy
tail which is closer to the Earth matter resonance energy. This eﬀect is il-
lustrated in Fig. 5 (right) which compares the energy spectrum between two
Super-Kamiokande-like detectors with and without Earth matter eﬀects. It
is obvious from this ﬁgure that the diﬀerence between the spectra around the
peak at
20 MeV is tiny, whereas statistically signiﬁcant deviations can be
found at larger energies. Such a scenario could happen if supernova neutrinos
were detected by two similar-sized detectors, one on the Earth’s surface and
with the Earth’s core in the line of sight (cf., Fig. 5, left). Note that the

supernova neutrinos are detected within a very short time frame
24 hr,
which means that one would actually obtain a “snapshot” of the Earth’s
interior. As it has been demonstrated in Ref. [46], for a galactic supernova
in the distance D = 10 kpc with an energy release of E = 3 1053 ergs, two
megaton-size Water Cherenkov detectors could measure the density of the
Earth’s core at the per cent level with a number of challenges: First, the
Earth’s mantle density is assumed to be known at the 2% level. Second, the
solar oscillation parameters have to be known at the 0.2% level. Third, too
similar supernova ﬂuxes for the diﬀerent ﬂavors (similar temperatures) and
deviations from energy equipartition are unfavorable. And fourth, one has
to have some knowledge on the ﬂavor composition of the ﬂux, possibly from
detection of diﬀerent ﬂavors.

4.3 Neutrino oscillation tomography with neutrino beams

We now discuss neutrino oscillation tomography with the “man-made” neu-
trino beams. Neutrino beams are planned or future neutrino sources using
accelerators, where the neutrino beam is produced by pion/kaon decays (su-
perbeams, see, e.g., Refs. [40; 11]), by muon decays (neutrino factory, see,
e.g., Refs. [25; 8; 5]), or by the decay of unstable nuclei (β-Beam, see, e.g.,
Refs. [67; 15; 16; 36]). Neutrino beams have, compared to “natural” neutrino
sources, the advantage that either ﬂux and ﬂavor composition are well-known,
or a near detector can be used to improve the knowledge on these quantities
as well as on the interaction cross sections. There is, however, one major
obstacle common to all of these experiments: Matter eﬀects especially enter
in the νe
νµ ﬂavor transition which is suppressed by the small mixing
angle sin2(2θ13). Up to know, this mixing angle is unknown and only an up-
per bound exists [7]. Experiments within the coming ten years will reveal if
sin2(2θ13) is suitably large for the applications discussed here (for a summary,
see, e.g., Ref. [35]). Therefore, the experiment performance has always to be

↔

evaluated as function of sin2(2θ13). In this section, we split the discussion
into conceptual areas linked to tomography with neutrino beams.

Positional information for a single baseline

An interesting question is discussed in Ref. [54]: Assume we have a beam
crossing a cavity with a speciﬁc density contrast compared to the surrounding
matter. Then one wants to know

– How large has the cavity to be to be detected?
– Can the position of the cavity be measured and if so, how precisely?

In Ref. [54] a 500 MeV superbeam is assumed with very luminous 200 000
events in total. The density in the cavity is assumed to be 1 g/cm3 (water),
the baseline L = 1 000 km, and sin2(2θ13) = 0.03, where a smaller number of
events can be compensated by a larger sin2(2θ13). It turns out that the cavity
has to be longer than about 100 km to be found and its size can be measured
50 km. As most important result, the position of the cavity can be
to about
reconstructed
100 km from a single baseline, which is very diﬀerent from X-
ray or absorption tomography. However, there is a degeneracy in the position
between x and L
x which can be only resolved by suppressed three-ﬂavor
eﬀects. This example demonstrates already one of the basic principles of
neutrino oscillation tomography: Positional information is available already
from a single baseline.

Resolution of structures and edges

One can learn about the resolution of structures and edges from the numer-
ical solution of the matter density inversion problem. In Ref. [53] a (sym-
metrized) REM proﬁle is reconstructed from a single baseline crossing the
outer core with 14 degrees of freedom using a genetic algorithm. Naturally,
there are many degenerate proﬁles close to the 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ contours, and
one cannot show a contour in 14-dimensional parameter space. Therefore, we
show in Fig. 6 several “typical” representatives close to the 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ
contours for a neutrino factory, where the total number of oscillated events
is for sin2(2θ13) = 0.1 only about a factor of four above currently discussed
luminosities (see, e.g., Ref. [33]). From Fig. 6, one can easily read oﬀ that
such an experiment could, in principle, reconstruct the mantle-core-mantle
structure of the Earth. However, structures smaller than several hundred
kilometers cannot be resolved. In addition, the mantle-core boundary cannot
be resolved at a suﬃciently high conﬁdence level from a single baseline. Ana-
lytically, it has been demonstrated in Ref. [53] that structures much smaller
than the oscillation length in matter cannot be resolved – as one would natu-
rally expect similar to other quantum mechanical phenomena. In conclusion,
neutrino oscillations in matter are very sensitive towards average densities
and the arrangement of structure on the length scale of the oscillation length.
However, neither can edges nor small structures be precisely resolved.

Density measurement

i = 1/L

Since we know that neutrino oscillations measure more or less the baseline-
L
averaged densities ¯ρL
0 ˜ρ(l)dl over long distances plus some sup-
pressed interference eﬀects, we can use this to discuss possible applications.
R
For example, let us assume that we want to perform a simple one-parameter
measurement of the Earth’s inner core density. Because the Earth’s mass is
ﬁxed, we need to correct the average mantle or outer core density for any shift
of the inner core density. Note, however, that it is the volume-averaged den-
sity to be corrected, which means that large shifts in the Earth’s inner core
density cause only very small density corrections in the mantle. This example
illustrates already one potential strength of neutrino oscillation tomography:
Since a neutrinos from a “vertical” baseline travel similar distances in mantle,
core, and inner core, there should be no a priori disadvantage for the inner-
most parts of the Earth. In Ref. [65] a neutrino factory setup from Ref. [33]
with currently anticipated luminosities was chosen to test this hypothesis
for realistic statistics. In order to measure the oscillation parameters, the
experiment with L = 2 RE was combined with a L = 3 000 km. The preci-
sion of the measurement can be found in Fig. 7 as function of sin2(2θ13).
One case easily read oﬀ that a per cent level measurement is realistic for
sin2(2θ13) & 0.01. Most importantly, the application survives the unknown

oscillation parameters and the performance is already close to the optimum
(dashed curves). For smaller values of 0.001 . sin2(2θ13) . 0.01, the corre-
lations would be much worse without the L = 3 000 km baseline. For large
values of sin2(2θ13) & 0.01, the vertical baseline alone is hardly aﬀected by
correlations with the oscillation parameters: As illustrated in Ref. [64], CP
eﬀects are suppressed for very long baselines. Since there is only a number
of potential high-energy laboratories around the world which could host a
neutrino factory, we show in Fig. 8 some examples and the corresponding
outer and inner core crossing baselines. Obviously, there are potential detec-
tor locations for some of the laboratories, which are, however, not exactly
on the L = 2RE-axis. Relaxing this baseline constraint somewhat, one can
show that one can ﬁnd detector locations for a small drop in precision [65].
In summary, this application illustrates that a density measurement could
be performed with a) reasonable statistics, b) including the correlations with
the oscillation parameters, and c) reasonably small values of sin2(2θ13). In
the future, it has to be clariﬁed how large the additional eﬀort for such a
facility (the vertical storage ring) would be. Note, however, that there are
plenty of other applications of a “very long” neutrino factory baseline, such
as the “magic baseline” to resolve degeneracies [32] (L
7 500 km), the test
of the MSW eﬀect for sin2(2θ13) = 0 [63] (L & 5 500 km), the mass hierarchy
measurement for sin2(2θ13) = 0 [31; 30] (L
6 000 km), and the test of the
“parametric resonance” [3; 57] (L

10 665 km).

In addition to the described neutrino sources, note that tomography com-
paring the neutrino and antineutrino disappearance information from atmo-
spheric neutrinos might, in principle, be possible as well [26].

5 Other geophysical aspects of neutrino oscillations

∼

It is well known that matter density uncertainties spoil the extraction of the
oscillation parameters from the measurements (see Refs. [41; 27; 60; 22; 56;
61; 44; 55] and references therein). In particular for baselines sensitive δCP,
such as L
3 000 km at a neutrino factory, the additional correlation with
the matter density aﬀects the precision measurements of sin2(2θ13) and δCP,
and the CP violation sensitivity. This eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the
precision of δCP and diﬀerent matter density uncertainties ∆ρ∗. Especially for
large sin2(2θ13), any uncertainty larger than about 1% aﬀects the precision
severely. Note that the baseline used for Fig. 9 is L = 3 000 km, which means
that the neutrinos travel in an average depth of
120 km up to a maximum
180 km. In these depths, the uncertainty among geophysics models
depth of
is currently at the level of 5% [27]. Since the matter density uncertainties may
aﬀect the competitiveness of a neutrino factory with a superbeam (operated
at shorter baselines) for large values of sin2(2θ13), improved knowledge for
speciﬁcally chosen baselines would be very helpful.

to geophysical methods. For example, neutrinos travel on straight lines with

almost no uncertainty in their path. Furthermore, neutrino tomography is
either sensitive to the nucleon density (absorption tomography) or electron
density (oscillation tomography). In comparison, the paths of seismic waves
are curved, and there is some uncertainty in them. In addition, the matter
density has to be reconstructed from the propagation velocity proﬁle by the
equation of state. This means that neutrino tomography might be a more
“direct” handle on the matter density and could be very useful to investigate
speciﬁcally localized regions, such as in the lower mantle. Moreover, there is
no principle reason to prevent neutrinos from penetrating the Earth’s core,
whereas seismic waves are partially reﬂected at the mantle-core and outer-
inner core boundaries. Note that though the most precise information on
deviations from the REM (“Reference Earth Model”) in the Earth’s mantle
comes from seismic waves, there are other geophysical methods which might
be more directly sensitive towards the matter density, such as normal modes,
mass, and rotational inertia of the Earth. Nevertheless, none of those could
provide a measurement along a very speciﬁc path.

The main challenges for neutrino tomography might be the existence of
high-energy neutrino sources for absorption tomography, and the statistics for
oscillation tomography. For example, neutrino oscillation tomography could,
in principle, reconstruct the matter density proﬁle along a single baseline
due to interference eﬀects among diﬀerent matter density layers. Note, how-
ever, that neutrino oscillations are to ﬁrst order sensitive towards densities

averaged over the scale of the oscillation length, which means that such so-
phisticated applications require extremely large luminosities (detector mass
running time) and might be very challenging. On the other
×
hand, very simple questions, such as a one-parameter measurement of the av-
erage density along the path or the discrimination between to very speciﬁc
degenerate geophysical models might be feasible within the next decades.
For example, the achievable precision for the inner core density of the Earth
0.23 g/cm3
with a neutrino factory experiment might be quite comparable (
for sin2(2θ13) = 0.01 and
0.06 g/cm3 for sin2(2θ13) = 0.1 [65]) to current
precisions given for the density jump at the inner-core boundary from geo-
0.18 g/cm3 in Ref. [47]). We therefore conclude that it will

be important that the right and simple questions to be asked by discussions
between neutrino physicists and geophysicists.

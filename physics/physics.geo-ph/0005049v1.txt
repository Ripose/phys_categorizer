River networks serve as a paradigmatic example of all branching networks. Essential to under-
standing the overall structure of river networks is a knowledge of their detailed architecture. Here we
show that sub-branches are distributed exponentially in size and that they are randomly distribut-
ed in space, thereby completely characterizing the most basic level of river network description.
Speciﬁcally, an averaged view of network architecture is ﬁrst provided by a proposed self-similarity
statement about the scaling of drainage density, a local measure of stream concentration. This scal-
ing of drainage density is shown to imply Tokunaga’s law, a description of the scaling of side branch
abundance along a given stream, as well as a scaling law for stream lengths. This establishes the
scaling of the length scale associated with drainage density as the basic signature of self-similarity
in river networks. We then consider ﬂuctuations in drainage density and consequently the num-
bers of side branches. Data is analyzed for the Mississippi River basin and a model of random
directed networks. Numbers of side streams are found to follow exponential distributions as are
stream lengths and inter-tributary distances along streams. Finally, we derive the joint variation
of side stream abundance with stream length, aﬀording a full description of ﬂuctuations in network
structure. Fluctuations in side stream numbers are shown to be a direct result of ﬂuctuations in
stream lengths. This is the last paper in a series of three on the geometry of river networks.

INTRODUCTION

This is the last paper in a series of three on the
geometry of river networks.
In the ﬁrst [1] we exam-
ine in detail the description of river networks by scaling
laws [2, 3, 4, 5] and the evidence for universality. Addi-
tional introductory remarks concerning the motivation of
the overall work are to found in this ﬁrst paper. In the
second article [6] we address distributions of the basic
components of river networks, stream segments and sub-
networks. Here, we provide an analysis complementary
to the work of the second paper by establishing a descrip-
tion of how river network components ﬁt together. As
before, we are motivated by the premise that while rela-
tionships of mean quantities are primary in any investi-
gation, the behavior of higher order moments potentially
and often do encode signiﬁcant information.

Our purpose then is to investigate the distributions
of quantities which describe the architecture of river
networks. The goal is to quantify these distributions
and, where this is not possible, to quantify ﬂuctuations.
In particular, we center our attention on Tokunaga’s
law [7, 8, 9] which is a statement about network architec-

ture describing the tributary structure of streams. Since
Tokunaga’s law can be seen as the main part of a plat-
form from which all other river network scaling laws fol-
low [4], it is an obvious starting point for the investigation
of ﬂuctuations in river network structure. We use data
from the Schediegger model of random networks [10] and
the Mississippi river. We ﬁnd the distributions obtained
from these two disparate sources agree very well in form.
We are able to write down scaling forms of all distribu-
tions studied. We observe a number of distributions to be
exponential, therefore requiring only one parameter for
their description. As a result, we introduce a dimension-
less scale ξt, ﬁnding it to be suﬃcient to describe the ﬂuc-
tuations present in Tokunaga’s law and thus potentially
all river network scaling laws. Signiﬁcantly, we observe
the spatial distribution of stream segments to be random
implying we have reached the most basic description of
network architecture.

Tokunaga’s law is also intimately connected with
drainage density, ρ, a quantity which will be used
throughout the paper. Drainage density is a measure
of stream concentration or, equivalently, how a network
ﬁlls space. We explore this connection in detail, showing
how simple assumptions regarding drainage density lead
to Tokunaga’s law.

The paper is structured as follows. We ﬁrst outline
Horton-Strahler stream ordering which provides the nec-
essary descriptive taxonomy for river network architec-
ture. We then deﬁne Tokunaga’s law and introduce a

scaling law for a speciﬁc form of drainage density. We
brieﬂy describe Horton’s laws for stream number and
length and some simple variations. (Both stream order-
ing and Horton’s laws are covered in more detail in [6]).
We show that the scaling law of drainage density may be
taken as an assumption from which all other scaling laws
follow. We also brieﬂy consider the variation of basin
shapes (basin allometry) in the context of directedness.
This brings us to the focal point of the paper, the identi-
ﬁcation of a statistical generalization of Tokunaga’s law.
We ﬁrst examine distributions of numbers of tributaries
(side streams) and compare these with distributions of
stream segment lengths. We observe both distributions
to be exponential leading to the notion that stream seg-
ments are distributed randomly throughout a network.
The presence of exponential distributions also leads to
the introduction of the characteristic number ξt and the
single length-scale ξl(s) ∝ ξt. We then study the variation
of tributary spacing along streams so as to understand
ﬂuctuations in drainage density and again ﬁnd the sig-
nature of randomness. This leads us to develop a joint
probability distribution connecting the length of a stream
with the frequency of its side streams.

II. DEFINITIONS

A. Stream ordering

Horton-Strahler stream ordering[11, 12] breaks a river
network down into a set of stream segments. The method
can be thought of as an iterative pruning. First, we
deﬁne a source stream as the stream section that runs
from a channel head to the ﬁrst junction with another
stream. These source streams are classiﬁed as the ﬁrst-
order stream segments of the network. Next, we remove
all source streams and identify the new source streams of
the remaining network. These are the network’s second-
order stream segments. The process is repeated until one
stream segment is left of order Ω. The order of the basin
is then deﬁned to be Ω (we will use the words basin and
network interchangeably).

In discussing network architecture, we will speak of
side streams and absorbing streams. A side stream is any
stream that joins into a stream of higher order, the latter
being the absorbing stream. We will denote the orders of
absorbing and side streams by µ and ν but when referring
to an isolated stream or streams where their relative rank
is ambiguous, we will write stream order as ω, subscripted
as seems appealing.

Central to our investigation of network architecture
is stream segment length. As in [6], we denote this
length by l (s)
ω for a stream segment of order ω. We will
also introduce a number of closely related lengths which
describe distances between side streams. When referring
to streams throughout we will speciﬁcally mean stream
segments of a particular order unless otherwise indicated.
This is to avoid confusion with the natural deﬁnition of a

2

stream which is the path from a point on a network mov-
ing upstream to the most distant source. For an order ω
basin, we denote this main stream length by lω

Note also that we consider river networks in planform,
i.e., as networks projected onto the horizontal (or gravi-
tationally ﬂat) plane. This simpliﬁcation poses no great
concern for the analysis of large scale networks such as
the Mississippi but must be considered in the context of
drainage basins with signiﬁcant relief.

B. Tokunaga’s law

Deﬁning a stream ordering on a network allows for a
number of well-deﬁned measures of connectivity, stream
lengths and drainage areas. Around a decade after the
Strahler-improved stream ordering of Horton appeared,
Tokunaga introduced the idea of measuring side stream
statistics [7, 8, 9]. This technique arguably provides the
most useful measurement based on stream ordering but
has only recently received much attention [4, 13, 14, 15].
The idea is simply, for a given network, to count the
average number of order ν side streams entering an order
µ absorbing stream. This gives hTµ,νi, a set of double-
indexed parameters for a basin. Note that Ω ≥ µ >
ν ≥ 1, so we can view the Tokunaga ratios as a lower
triangular matrix. An example for the Mississippi river
is shown in Table I [30] The same data is represented
pictorially in Figure 1 in what we refer to as a Tokunaga
graph.

TABLE I: Tokunaga ratios for the Mississippi River. The
row indices are the absorbing stream orders while the columns
correspond to side stream orders. Each entry is the average
number of order ν side streams per order µ absorbing stream.

Tokunaga made several key observations about these
side stream ratios. The ﬁrst is that because of the self-
similar nature of river networks, the hTµ,νi should not
depend absolutely on either of µ or ν but only on the
relative diﬀerence, i.e., k = µ − ν. The second is that in
changing the value of k = µ − ν, the hTµ,νi must them-
selves change by a systematic ratio. These statements

streams, i.e., the characteristic scale beyond which ero-
sion cannot more ﬁnely dissect the landscape [11].
In
principle, drainage density may vary from landscape to
landscape and also throughout a single region. Below, we
will turn this observation about Tokunaga’s law around
to show that all river network scaling laws may be derived
from an expanded notion of drainage density.

Even though the number of side streams entering any
absorbing stream must of course be an integer, Tokuna-
ga’s ratios are under no similar obligation since they are
averages. Nevertheless, Tokunaga’s law provides a good
sense of the structure of a network albeit at a level of
averages. One of our main objectives here is to go further
and consider ﬂuctuations about and the full distributions
underlying the hTµ,νi.
Finally, a third important observation of Tokunaga is
that two of Horton’s laws follow from Tokunaga’s law,
which we next discuss.

FIG. 1: A Tokunaga graph for the Mississippi River. The
values are given in Table I. Each point represents a Tokunaga
ratio hTµ,ν i. The solid lines follow variations in the order
of the absorbing stream µ while the dotted lines follow unit
increments in both µ and ν, the order of side streams.
In
comparison, the Tokunaga graph of an exactly self-similar
network would have points evenly spaced at ln T1 + (µ + ν −
1) ln RT where 1 ≤ ν < µ = 2, 3, . . . , Ω, i.e., all lines in the
plot would be straight and uniformly spaced, with the dotted
lines being horizontal. The nature of deviations in scalings
laws for river networks is addressed in [1].

lead to Tokunaga’s law:

hTµ,νi = hTki = hT1i (RT )k−1.

(1)

Thus, only two parameters are necessary to characterize
the set of Tµ,ν: T1 and RT .

The parameter T1 > 0 is the average number of side
streams of one order lower than the absorbing stream,
typically on the order of 1.0–1.5. Since these side streams
of one order less are the dominant side streams of the
basin, their number estimates the basin’s breadth.
In
general, larger values of hT1i correspond to wider basins
while smaller values are in keeping with basins with rel-
atively thinner proﬁles.

The ratio RT > 1 measures how the density of side
streams of decreasing order increases. It is a measure of
changing length scales and has a simple interpretation
with respect to Horton’s laws which we describe below.
Thus, already inherent in Tokunaga’s law is a generaliza-
tion of drainage density ρ. the usual deﬁnition of which is
given as follows. For a given region of landscape with area
A with streams totalling in length L, ρ = L/A and has
the dimensions of an inverse length scale [11]. One may
think of ρ as the inverse of the typical distance between

C. Horton’s laws

We review Horton’s laws [4, 11, 16] and then show
how self-similarity and drainage density lead to Tokuna-
ga’s law, Horton’s laws and hence all other river network
scaling laws.

The relevant quantities for Horton’s relations are nω,
the number of order ω streams, and hlωi, the average
main stream length (as opposed to stream segment length
hl (s)
ω i) of order ω basins. The laws are simply that the
ratio of these quantities from order to order remain con-
stant:

nω+1
nω

= 1/Rn

and

hlω+1i
hlωi

= Rl,

(2)

for ω ≥ 1. Note the deﬁnitions are chosen so that all
ratios are greater than unity. The number of streams
decreases with order while all areas and lengths grow.

A similar law for basin areas [11, 16] states that
haω+1i/haωi = Ra where haωi is the average drainage
area of an order ω basin. However, with the assump-
tion of uniform drainage density it can be shown that
Rn ≡ Ra [4] so we are left with the two independent
Horton laws of equation (2).
As in [6], we consider another Horton-like law for

stream segment lengths:

ω+1E
Dl (s)
Dl (s)
ω E

= Rl(s) .

(3)

As we will show, the form of the distribution of the vari-
able Tµ,ν is a direct consequence of the distribution of
l (s)
ω .

Tokunaga showed that Horton’s laws of stream num-
ber and stream length follow from what we have called
Tokunaga’s law, equation (1). For example, the solu-
tion of a diﬀerence equation relating the nω and the Tk

T − 2RT(cid:3)1/2

leads to the result Rn = AT + (cid:2)A2
where
AT = (2 + RT + T1)/2 for Ω = ∞ and a more com-
plicated expression is obtained for ﬁnite Ω [4, 8, 9, 15].
In keeping with our previous remarks on T1, this expres-
sion for Rn shows that an increase in T1 will increase Rn
which, since Ra ≡ Rn, corresponds to a network where
basins tend to be relatively broader. Our considerations
will expand signiﬁcantly on this connection between the
network descriptions of Horton and Tokunaga.

III. THE IMPLICATIONS OF A SCALING LAW

FOR DRAINAGE DENSITY

We now introduce a law for drainage density based on
stream ordering. We write ρµ,ν for the number of side
streams of order ν per unit length of order µ absorbing
stream. We expect these densities to be independent of
the order of the absorbing stream and so we will gener-
ally use ρν. The typical length separating order ν side
streams is then 1/ρν. Assuming self-similarity of river
networks, we must have

ρν+1/ρν = 1/Rρ

(4)

where Rρ > 1 independent of ν.

All river network scaling laws in the planform may
be seen to follow from this relationship. Consider an
absorbing stream of order µ. Self-similarity immediately
demands that the number of side streams of order µ − 1
must be statistically independent of µ. This number is
of course hT1i. Therefore, the typical length of an order
µ absorbing stream must be

µ E = hT1i /ρµ−1.
Dl (s)

(5)

Using equation (4) to replace ρµ−1 in the above equation,
we ﬁnd

T1/ρµ−1 = RρT1/ρµ−2.

(6)

Thus, T2 = RρT1 and, in general Tk = (Rρ)k−1T1. This
is Tokunaga’s law and we therefore have

Rρ ≡ RT .

Equation (4) and equation (5) also give

µ E = T1/ρµ−1 = RρT1/ρµ−2 = RρDl (s)
Dl (s)

µ−1E .

(7)

(8)

On comparison with equation (3), we see that the above
is our Hortonian law of stream segment lengths and that

Rρ ≡ Rl(s) .

(9)

As Rl(s) is the basic length-scale ratio in the problem,
we rewrite equation (4), our Hortonian law of drainage
density, as

ρν+1/ρν = 1/Rl(s) .

(10)

The above statement becomes our deﬁnition of the self-
similarity of drainage density.

IV. BASIN ALLOMETRY

Given that we have suggested the need for only a sin-
gle relevant length ratio, we must remark here on basin
allometry. Allometry refers to the relative growth or scal-
ing of a shape’s dimensions and was originally introduced
in the context of biology [17]. A growth or change being
allometric usually implies it is not self-similar. A long-
standing issue in the study of river networks has been
whether or not basins are allometric [3, 5, 18].

Consider

two basins described by (L1, W1) and
(L2, W2) within the same system where Li is a char-
acteristic longitudinal basin length and Wi a charac-
teristic width. The basins being allometric means that
(W1/W2) = (L1/L2)H where H < 1. Thus, two length
ratios are needed to describe the allometry of basins. If
we consider basins deﬁned by stream ordering then we
have the Horton-like ratios RL and RW = RH
L . Now,
when rescaling an entire basin, streams roughly aligned
with a basin’s length will rescale with the factor RL
and those perpendicular to the basin’s axis will rescale
diﬀerently with RW . This creates a conundrum: how
can basins be allometric (RL 6= RW ) and yet individual
streams be self-similar (RL = RW ) as implied by Hor-
ton’s laws?

We contend the answer is that allometry must be
restricted to directed networks and that self-similarity of
basins must hold for non-directed networks. This is in
agreement with Colaiori et al. [19] who also distinguish
between self-similar and allometric river basins although
we stress here the qualiﬁcation of directedness. Direct-
ed networks have a global direction of ﬂow in which the
direction of each individual stream ﬂow has a positive
component. A basic example is the random model of
Scheidegger [10] which we describe below. For a direct-
ed network, RL = Rl, and the rescaling of basin sizes
matches up with the rescaling of stream lengths regard-
less of how the basin’s width rescales since all streams
are on average aligned with the global direction of ﬂow.
Hence, our premise that streams rescale in a self-similar
way is general enough to deal with systems whose basins
rescale in an allometric fashion.

In considering the allometry of basins, we must also
address the additional possibility that individual stream
lengths may scale non-trivially with basin length. In this
case, the main stream length l would vary with the lon-
gitudinal basin length L as l ∝ Ld. This is typically a
weak dependence with 1.0 < d < 1.15 [2, 20]. Note that
Horton’s laws still apply in this case. The exponent d
plays a part in determining whether or not a basin scales
allometrically. The exponent H introduced in the discus-
sion of basin allometry can be found in terms of Horton’s
ratios (or equivalently Tokunaga’s parameters) and d as
H = d ln Rn/ ln Rl − 1 [4].
Thus, for a directed network d = 1 and H ≤ 1 (e.g.,
Scheidegger [10]) whereas for undirected, self-similar net-
works H = 1 and d ≥ 1 (e.g., random undirected net-
works [21, 22]). River networks are in practice often nei-

ther fully directed or undirected. Scaling laws observed
in such cases will show deviations from pure scaling that
may well be gradual and diﬃcult to detect [1].

V. TOKUNAGA DISTRIBUTIONS

The laws of Tokunaga and Horton relate averages of
quantities. In the remainder of this paper, we investigate
the underlying distributions from which these averages
are made. We are able to ﬁnd general scaling forms of a
number of distributions and in many cases also identify
the basic form of the relevant scaling function.

FIG. 2: Scheidegger’s random directed networks. Sites are
arranged on a triangular lattice and stream ﬂow is directed
down the page. At each site, the ﬂow direction is randomly
chosen to be in one of the directions shown on the left. The
dashed box indicates the area “drained” by the local site.

To aid and motivate our investigations, we examine,
as we have done in both [1] and [6], a simple model of
directed random networks that was ﬁrst introduced by
Scheidegger [10] Since we make much of use this model in
the present work, we provide a self-contained discussion.
Consider the triangular lattice of sites oriented as in Fig-
ure 2. At each site of the lattice a stream ﬂow direction
is randomly chosen between the two possible diagonal
directions shown. It is therefore trivial to generate the
model on a large scale, allowing for a thorough investi-
gation of its river network statistics. The small, tilted
box with a dashed boundary represents the area drained
by the enclosed site. As with many discrete-space mod-
els, the details of the underlying lattice are unimportant.
On a square lattice, the model’s streams would have three
choices of ﬂow, two diagonals and straight down the page.
However, the choice of a triangular lattice does simplify
implementation and calculation of statistics. For exam-
ple, only one tributary can exist at each site along a
stream and stream paths and basin boundaries are pre-
cisely those of the usual discrete-space random walk [23].
Since random walks are well understood, the exponents
of many river network scaling laws are exactly known
for the Scheidegger model [24, 25, 26, 27] and analogies
may also be drawn with the Abelian sandpile model [28].
For example, a basin’s boundaries being random walks

5

means that a basin of length L will typically have a width
W ∝ L1/2 which gives H = 1/2. Since the network is
directed, stream length is the same as basin length, l = L,
so we trivially have d = 1. Basin area a is estimated by
W L ∝ L3/2 ∝ l3/2 so l ∝ a2/3 giving Hack’s law with an
exponent of 2/3 [18].
Nevertheless, the Tokunaga parameters and the Hor-
ton ratios are not known analytically. Estimates from
previous work [4] ﬁnd T1 ≃ 1.35, Rl = RT ≃ 3.00 and
Rn ≃ 5.20. Data for the present analysis was obtained on
L = 104 by W = 3×103 lattices with periodic boundaries.
Given the self-averaging present in any single instance on
these networks, ensembles of 10 were deemed suﬃcient.
We ﬁrst examine the distributions of Tokunaga ratios
Tµ,ν and observe a strong link to the underlying distribu-
tion of l (s)
µ . Both are well described by exponential dis-
tributions. To understand this link, we next consider the
distances between neighboring side streams of like order.
This provides a measure of ﬂuctuations in drainage den-
sity and again, exponential distributions appear. We are
then in a position to develop theory for the joint probabil-
ity distribution between the Tokunaga ratios and stream
segment lengths and, as a result, the distribution for the
quantity Tµ,ν/l (s)
µ and its inverse. In the limit of large µ,
the Tµ,ν are eﬀectively proportional to l (s)
and all ﬂuc-
µ
tuations of the former exactly follow those of the latter.
All investigations are initially carried out for the Schei-
degger model where we may generate statistics of ever-
improving quality. We ﬁnd the same forms for all distri-
butions for the Mississippi data (and for other river net-
works not presented here) and provide some pertinent
examples. Perhaps the most signiﬁcant beneﬁt of the
simple Scheidegger model is its ability to provide clean
distributions whose form we can then search for in real
data.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the number of order
ν = 2 side streams entering an order µ = 6 absorbing
stream for the Scheidegger model. At ﬁrst, it may seem
surprising that this is not a single-peaked distribution
centered around hTµ,νi dying oﬀ for small and large val-
ues of Tµ,ν.
The distribution of Tµ,ν in Figure 3 is clearly well
described by an exponential distribution. This can also
be seen upon inspection of Figures 4(a) and 4(b). Fig-
ure 4(a) shows normalized distributions of Tµ,ν for ν = 2
and varying absorbing stream order µ = 4, 5 and 6.
These distributions (plus the one for absorbing stream
order µ = 7) are rescaled and presented in Figure 4(b).
The single form thus obtained suggests a scaling form of
the Tµ,ν distribution is given by

P (Tµ,ν) = (Rl(s) )−µF (cid:2)Tµ,ν(Rl(s) )−µ(cid:3) .

(11)

where F is an exponential scaling function. However,
this only accounts for variations in µ, the order of the
absorbing stream.

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show that a similar rescaling of
the distributions may be eﬀected when ν is varied. In this

by Rl(s) rather than R−1
l(s) and equation (11) is improved
to give

P (Tµ,ν) = (Rl(s) )µ−ν−1PT (cid:2)Tµ,ν/(Rl(s) )µ−ν−1(cid:3) .

one order lower than the absorbing stream, i.e., ξt =

for the Scheidegger model, ξt ≃ 1.35. As expected, the
Tokunaga distribution is dependent only on k = µ− ν so
we can write

P (Tk) = (Rl(s) )k−1PT (cid:2)Tµ,ν/(Rl(s) )k−1(cid:3) .

with PT as above.

tributions for absorbing stream order µ = 4 (circles), µ = 5
(squares) and µ = 6 (triangles). In (b), these distributions, as

The resulting “data collapse” gives a single distribution. For
the Scheidegger model, Rl(s) ≃ 3.00.

segment lengths. Figure 6 is the indicates why this is so.
The form of the underlying distribution is itself exponen-
tial. We have already examined this fact extensively in [6]
and here we develop its relationship with the Tokunaga
distributions.

Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show that the distributions of
l (s)
can be rescaled in the same way as the Tokunaga
µ
distributions. Thus, we write the distribution for stream
segment lengths as [6]

P (l (s)

µ ) = (Rl(s) )−µ+1Pl(s) hl (s)

µ /(Rl(s) )−µ+1i .

(15)

As for PT , the function Pl(s) is a normalized exponential
distribution

Pl(s) (z) =

1
ξl(s)

e−z/ξ

l(s) ,

(16)

where, in a strictly self-similar network, ξl(s) is the charac-
teristic length of ﬁrst-order stream segments, i.e., ξl(s) =
hl (s)
(Note that in [6] we use ξ for ξl(s) for ease of
1 i.
notation). We qualify this by requiring the network to
be exactly self-similar because in most models and all
real networks this is certainly not the case. As should be
expected, there are deviations from scaling for the largest

FIG. 5:
Tokunaga distributions for varying side stream
orders for the Mississippi river basin. In both (a) and (b), the
absorbing stream order is µ = 5 and the side stream orders
are ν = 2 (circles), ν = 3 (squares) and ν = 4 (triangles).
The raw distributions are shown in (a). In (b) the distribu-
tions are rescaled as per equation (12). For the Mississippi,
the ratio is estimated to be Rl(s) ≃ 2.40 [6].

FIG. 6:
Stream segment length distributions for varying
stream order for the Scheidegger model. Lengths are in units
the lattice spacing. Shown in (a) are raw distributions for ω =
4 (circles), ω = 5 (squares) and ω = 6. The linear forms on the
semilogarithmic axes indication these distributions are well
approximated by exponentials [6]. In (b), the distributions in
(a) plus the distribution for l (s)
(diamonds) are rescaled using
equation (15).

and smallest orders. Therefore, ξl(s) is the characteristic
size of a ﬁrst-order stream as determined by scaling down
the average lengths of those higher order streams that are
in the self-similar structure of the network. It is thus in

general diﬀerent from hl (s)
1 i.
We therefore see that the distributions of Tµ,ν and l (s)
µ
are both exponential in form. Variations in l (s)
largely
µ
govern the possible values of the Tµ,ν. However, Tµ,ν
is still only proportional to l (s)
on average and later on
µ
we will explore the joint distribution from which these
individual exponentials arise.

The connection between the characteristic number ξt
and the length-scale ξl(s) follows from equations (3), (5),
and (10):

ξt = ρ1Rl(s) ξl(s) .

(17)

This presumes exact scaling of drainage densities and in
the case where this is not so, ρ1 would be chosen so that
(Rl(s) )ν−1ρ1 most closely approximates the higher order
ρν.

We come to an important interpretation of the expo-
nential distribution as a composition of
independent
probabilities. Consider the example of stream segment
lengths. We write ˜pµ as the probability that a stream

segment of order µ meets with (and thereby terminates
at) a stream of order at least µ. For simplicity, we assume
only one side stream or none may join a stream at any
site. We also take the lattice spacing α to be unity so that
stream lengths are integers and therefore equate with the
number of links between sites along a stream. For α 6= 1,
derivations similar to below will apply with l (s)
µ replaced
by [l (s)
µ /α], where [·] denotes rounding to the nearest
integer. Note that extra complications arise when the
distances between neighboring sites are not uniform.

Consider a single instance of an order µ stream seg-
ment. The probability of this segment having a length
l (s)
µ

is given by

P (l (s)

µ ) = ˜pµ(1 − ˜pµ)l (s)

µ .

(18)

where ˜pµ is the probability that an order an order µ
stream segment terminates on meeting a stream of equal
or higher order. We can re-express the above equation as

P (l (s)

µ ) ≃ ˜pµ exp{−l (s)

µ ln(1 − ˜pµ)−1},

(19)

and upon inspection of equations (15) and (16) we make
the identiﬁcation

(Rl(s) )µ−1ξl(s) = [− ln(1 − ˜pµ)]−1,

FIG. 7: A comparison of inter-tributary length distributions
for the Scheidegger model. The example here is for order
µ = 6 absorbing streams and order ν = 3 side streams. Note
that no rescaling of the distributions has been performed. The
three length variables here correspond to x=b, x=i and x=e,
i.e., l(s, b)

For µ suﬃciently large such that ˜pµ ≪ 1, we have the
simpliﬁcation

˜pµ ≃ 1/(Rl(s))µ−1ξl(s) .

(22)

We see that the probabilities satisfy the Horton-like scal-
ing law

˜pµ/˜pµ−1 = 1/Rl(s).

(23)

Thus, we begin to see the element of randomness in our
expanded description of network architecture. The ter-
mination of a stream segment by meeting a larger branch
is eﬀectively a spatially random process.

VII. GENERALIZED DRAINAGE DENSITY

Having observed the similarity of the distributions of
Tµ,ν and l (s)
µ , we proceed to examine the exact nature of
the relationship beteween the two. To do so, we introduce
three new measures of stream length. These are l(s, b)
µ,ν ,

FIG. 8: An examination of the asymptotic behavior of dis-
tributions of internal inter-tributary lengths. The data here
is for the Scheidegger model for the case of ﬁxed side stream
order ν = 2. The plot in (a) shows distributions for absorb-
ing stream order µ = 3 (circles), µ = 4 (squares), µ = 6
(triangles), and µ = 8 (diamonds). As µ increases, the distri-
butions, which are all individually exponential, tend towards
a ﬁxed exponential distribution. Since lower order stream seg-
ments have typically smaller lengths, they statistically block
larger values of l(s, i)
µ,ν , reducing the extent of the distribution
tails for low µ. This is further evidenced in (b) which pro-
vides a plot of hl(s, i)
µ,ν i, the mean inter-tributary stream length,
as a function of µ with ν = 2. These mean values approach
hl(s, i)
µ,ν=2i = 1/ρ2 ≃ 10.1 where ρ2 is the density of second-order
side streams.

the distance from the beginning of an order µ absorbing
stream to the ﬁrst order ν side stream; l(s, i)
µ,ν , the distance
between any two adjacent internal order ν side streams
along an order µ absorbing stream; and ls, e
µ,ν, the distance
from the last order ν side stream to the end of an order
µ absorbing stream. By analysis of these inter-tributary
lengths, we will be able to discern the distribution of
side stream location along absorbing streams. This leads
directly to a more general picture of drainage density
which we fully expand upon in the following section.

Figure 7 compares normalized distributions of l(s, b)
µ,ν ,
l(s, i)
µ,ν and ls, e
µ,ν for the Scheidegger model. The data is for
the distance between order ν = 3 side streams entering
order µ = 6 absorbing streams. Once again, the distribu-
tions are well approximated by exponential distributions.
Moreover, they are indistinguishable. This indicates, at
least for the Scheidegger model, that drainage density is

independent of relative position of tributaries along an
absorbing stream.

We now consider the eﬀect on the distribution of inter-
nal inter-tributary distances l(s, i)
following from varia-
µ,ν
tions in µ, the order of the absorbing stream. Figure 8(a)
provides a comparison of l(s, i)
µ,ν distributions for ν = 2
and µ = 3 through µ = 8. As µ increases, the distri-
butions tend towards a limiting function. With increas-
ing µ we are, on average, sampling absorbing streams of
greater length and the full range of l(s, i)
µ,ν becomes accord-
ingly more accessible. This approach to a ﬁxed distri-
bution is reﬂected in the means of the distributions in
µ,ν i for
ν = 2 approach a value of around 10.1. The correspond-
ing density of second-order streams for the Scheidegger
µ,ν=2i ≃ 0.01. Higher drainage
densities follow from equation (10). However, since devi-
ations occur for small ν, there will also be an approach
to uniform scaling to consider with drainage density.

Figure 8(a). Shown in Figure 8(b), the means hl(s, i)

model is thus ρ2 = 1/hl(s, i)

VIII. JOINT VARIATION OF TOKUNAGA
RATIOS AND STREAM SEGMENT LENGTH

We have so far observed that the individual distribu-
tions of the l (s)
and Tµ,ν are exponential and that they
µ
are related via the side-stream density ρnu. However,
this is not an exact relationship. For example, given a
collection of stream segments with a ﬁxed length l (s)
µ we
expect to ﬁnd ﬂuctuations in the corresponding Tokuna-
ga ratios Tµ,ν.

To investigate this further we now consider the joint
variation of Tµ,ν with l (s)
µ from a number of perspectives.
After discussing the full joint probability distribution
µ ) we then focus on the quotient v = Tµ,ν/l (s)
P (Tµ,ν, l (s)
µ
and its reciprocal w = l (s)
µ /Tµ,ν. The latter two quanti-
ties are measures of drainage density and inter-tributary
length for an individual absorbing stream.

A. The joint probability distribution

We build the joint distribution of P (Tµ,ν, l (s)

µ ) from
our conception that stream segments are randomly dis-
tributed throughout a basin. In equation (18), we have
the probability of a stream segment terminating after l (s)
µ
steps. We need to incorporate into this form the prob-
ability that the stream segment also has Tµ,ν order ν
side streams. Since we assume placement of these side
streams to be random, we modify equation (18) to ﬁnd

P (l (s)

µ , Tµ,ν) = ˜pµ(cid:18)l (s)

Tµ,ν (cid:19)pTµ,ν
µ − 1

ν

(1 − pν − ˜pµ)l (s)

µ −Tµ,ν −1,

(24)

where (cid:0)n

k(cid:1) = n!/k!(n − k)! is the binomial coeﬃcient and

pν is the probability of absorbing an order ν side stream.

9

The extra pν appears in the last factor (1 − pν − ˜pµ)
because this term is the probability that at a particular
site the stream segment neither terminates nor absorbs
an order ν side stream. Also, it is simple to verify that the
sum over l (s)
µ and Tµ,ν of the probability in equation (19)
returns unity.

While equation (19) does precisely describe the joint
distribution P (l (s)
µ , Tµ,ν), it is somewhat cumbersome to
work with. We therefore ﬁnd an analogous form deﬁned
for continuous rather than discrete variables. We simplify
our notation by writing p = pν, q = (1 − pν − ˜pµ) and
˜p = ˜pµ. We also replace (l (s)
µ , Tµ,ν) by (x, y) where now
x, y ∈ R. Note that 0 ≤ y ≤ x − 1 since the number of
side streams cannot be greater than the number of sites
within a stream segment.
Equation (19) becomes

P (x, y) = N ˜p

Γ(x)

Γ(y + 1)Γ(x − y)

(p)y(q)x−y−1,

(25)

where we have used Γ(z + 1) = z! to generalize the
binomial coeﬃcient. We have included the normaliza-
tion N to account for the fact that we have moved to
continuous variables and the resulting probability may
not be cleanly normalized. Also we must allow that
N = N (p, ˜p) and we will be able to identify this form
more fully later on. Using Stirling’s approximation [29],

that Γ(z + 1) ∼ √2πzz+1/2e−z, we then have

where we have absorbed N and all terms involving only
p and ˜p into the prefactor N ′ = N ′(p, ˜p) = N ˜p/(√2πq).
We have also assumed x is large such that x − 1 ≃ x and
1 ≫ 1/x ≃ 0.
The function F (v) = F (v; p, q) identiﬁed above has the
form

F (v) = (cid:18)1 − v

q (cid:19)−(1−v)(cid:18)v

p(cid:19)−v

.

(27)

where 0 < v < 1 (here and later, the variable v will refer
to y/x). Note that for ﬁxed x, the conditional probability
P (y | x) is proportional to [F (y/x)]x. Figure 9(a) shows
[F (v)]x for a range of powers x. The basic function has a
single peak situated near v = p. For increasing x which
corresponds to increasing l (s)
µ , the peak becomes sharp-
er approaching (when normalized) a delta function, i.e.,
limx→∞[F (v)]x = δ(v − p).
Figure 9(b) provides a comparison between data for the
Scheidegger model and the analytic form of P (l (s)
µ , Tµ,ν).
For this example, µ = 6 and ν = 2 which corresponds to
p ≃ 0.10, q ≃ 0.90 and ˜p ≃ 0.001 (using the results

derived from equation (26),

.

(28)

All rescaled data is then combined, binned and plotted as
circles in Figure 9(b), showing excellent agreement with
the theoretical curve.

B. Distributions of side branches per unit stream

P (v) and P (w) with data from the Scheidegger model. In
both cases, the data is for order ν = 2 side streams being
absorbed by streams of order µ = 6. Note that both dis-
tributions show an initially exponential-like decay away
from a central peak. Moreover, the agreement is excel-
lent, oﬀering further support to the notion that the spa-
tial distribution of stream segments is random.

FIG. 10: Comparison of theory with measurements of aver-
age inter-tributary distances for the Scheidegger model. The
data in both (a) and (b) is for the case of order ν = 2 side
streams and order µ = 6 absorbing streams. In (a), the distri-
bution of v = Tµ,ν /l (s)
obtained from the Scheidegger model
µ
(circles) is compared with the smooth curved predicted in
equation (33). The same comparison is made for the recipro-
cal variable w = l (s)
µ /Tµ,ν, the predicted curve being given in
equation (34).

FIG. 11: Distributions of the quantity Tµ,ν /l (s)

ing and the side stream order ﬁxed at ν = 2. Given in (a) are
unrescaled distributions for µ = 5 (circles), µ = 6 (squares),
µ = 7 (triangles), and µ = 8 (diamonds). Note that as the
order of the absorbing stream increases so does its typical
length. This leads to better averaging and the standard devi-
ation of the distribution decays as R−ω/2
. The distributions
are all centered near the typical density of order ν = 2 side
streams, ρ2 ≃ 0.10. The rescaled versions of these distribu-
tions are given in (b) with the details as per equation (36).

l

Finally, we quantify how changes in the orders µ and ν
aﬀect the width of the distributions by considering some
natural rescalings. Figure 11(a) shows binned, normal-
ized distributions of Tµ,ν/l (s)
µ for the Scheidegger model.
Here, the side stream order is ν = 2 and the absorbing
stream orders range over µ = 5 to µ = 8. All distribu-
tions are centered around ρ2 ≃ 0.10.
Because the average length of l (s)
µ increases by a factor
Rl(s) with µ, the typical number of side streams increases
by the same factor. Since we can decompose l (s)

µ as

l (s)
µ = l(s, b)

µ,ν + l(s, i)

µ becomes

where there are Tµ,ν − 1 instances of l(s, i)
better and better approximated by (Tµ,ν + 1)hl(s, i)
µ,ν i.
Hence, the distribution of Tµ,ν/l (s)
µ peaks up around
ρ2 as µ increases, the typical width reducing by a factor
of 1/pRl(s) for every step in µ. Using this observation,

Figure 11(b) shows a rescaling of the same distributions
shown in Figure 11(a). The form of this rescaling is

where the function is similar to the form of P (v) given
in equation (33). The mean drainage density of ρ2 has
been subtracted to center the distribution.

We are able to generalize this scaling form of the distri-
bution further by taking into account side stream order.
Figures 12(a) and 12(b) respectively show the unrescaled
and rescaled distributions of Tµ,ν/l (s)
µ with ν allowed to
vary. This particular example taken from the Scheideg-
ger model is for µ = 6 and the range ν = 1 to ν = 5.
Since ν is now changing, the centers are situated at the
separate values of the ρν . Also, the typical number of side
streams changes with order ν so the widths of the distri-

butions dilate as for the varying µ case by a factorpRl(s) .

Notice that the rescaling works well for ν = 2, . . . , 5 but
not ν = 1. As we have noted, deviations from scaling
from small orders are to be expected. In this case, we
are led to write down

P (Tµ,ν/l (s)

ν )(Rl(s) )−ν/2G2(cid:16)[Tµ,ν/l (s)

ν − ρν](Rl(s) )−ν/2(cid:17)

(37)

where, again, G2(z) is similar in form to P (v).

FIG. 12: Distributions of number of side streams per unit
length for the Scheidegger model with ν, the order of side
streams, varying. For both (a) and (b), the absorbing stream
order is µ = 6. Shown in (a) are the unrescaled distribu-
tions for ν = 2 (circles), ν = 3 (squares), and ν = 4 (tri-
angles). Note that as ν increases, the mean number of side
streams decreases as do the ﬂuctuations. The distributions in
(a) together with the distribution for ν = 5 (diamonds) are
shown rescaled in (b) as per equation (38).

FIG. 13: Tokunaga statistics for the Mississippi river basin.
The distributions are as per Figure 12(a), distributions of
number of side streams per unit length with ν, the order of
side streams, varying. The absorbing stream order is µ =
7 and the the individual distributions correspond to ν = 2
(circles), ν = 3 (squares) and ν = 4 (triangles). All lengths
are measured in meters. Rescalings of the distributions shown
in (a) along with that for ν = 5 (diamonds) are found in (b).
Reasonable agreement with equation (38) is observed.

ν

We ﬁnd the same rescalings apply for the Mississip-
pi data. For example, Figure 13(a) shows unrescaled
distributions of Tµ,ν/l (s)
for varying ν. Figure 13(b)
then shows reasonable agreement with the form of equa-
tion (37).
In this case, the Scheidegger model clearly
aﬀords valuable guidance in our investigations of real
river networks. The ratio Rl(s) = 2.40 was calculated
from an analysis of l (s)
ω and lω. The density ρ2 ≃ 0.0004
was estimated directly from the distributions of Tµ,ν/l (s)
and means that approximately four second-order streams
appear every ten kilometers.

ν

Combining equations (38) and (38), we obtain the com-

plete scaling form

the argument of the denominator, − ln F (v), with F (v)
given in equation (27). Since the numerator of P (v) is
1 + v2 and the maximum occurs for small v this is a
justiﬁable step. Setting dF/dv = 0, we thus have

1 − v

q

− ln

+ ln vp = 0,

(39)

which gives vm = p/(q + p) = p/(1 − ˜p). Note that for
˜p ≪ 1, we have vm ≃ p.
Substituting v = vm = p/(1 − ˜p into equation (33), we
ﬁnd

P (vm) ≃ N ′′ ˜p−3/2 = N ˜p−1/22−3/2

(40)

P (Tµ,ν/l (s)

ν ) = (Rl(s) )(µ−ν−1)/2G(cid:16)[Tµ,ν/l (s)

ν − ρν](Rl(s) )(µ−ν−1)/2(cid:17) .

(38)

As per G1 and G2, the function G is similar in form to
P (v).

The above scaling form makes intuitive sense but is
not obviously obtained from an inspection of (33). We
therefore examine P (v) by determining the position and
magnitude of its maximum. Rather than solve P ′(v) = 0
directly, we ﬁnd an approximate solution by considering

presuming p2 ≪ 1 and q ≃ 1. Returning to the scaling
form of equation (38), we see that the ˜p−1/2 factor in
equation (40) accounts for the factors of (Rl(s) )µ/2 since
˜p = ˜pµ scales from level to level by the ratio Rl(s) . We
therefore ﬁnd the other factor (Rl(s) )ν/2 of equation (38)
gives N = cp1/2 where c is a constant. Since p = pν,
it is the only factor that can provide this variation. We
thus have found the variation with stream order of the
normalization N and have fully characterized, P (x, y),
the continuum approximation of P (l (s)

µ , Tµ,ν).

IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have extensively investigated river network archi-
tecture as viewed in planform. We identify the self-
similarity of a form of drainage density as the essence
of the average connectivity and structure of networks.
From previous work in [4], we then understand this to
be a base from which all river network scaling laws may
obtained.

We have extended the description of tributary struc-
ture provided by Tokunaga’s law to ﬁnd that side stream
numbers are distributed exponentially. This in turn is
seen to follow from the fact that the length of stream
segments are themselves exponentially distributed. We
interpret this to be consequence of randomness in the
spatial distribution of stream segments. Furthermore,
the presence of exponential distributions indicate ﬂuc-
tuations in variables are signiﬁcant being on the order
of mean values. For the example of stream segment
lengths, we thus identify ξl(s) , a single parameter need-
ed to describe all moments. This is simply related to
ξt, which describes the distributions of Tokunaga ratios.
The exponential distribution becomes the null hypothe-
sis for the distributions of these variables to be used in
the examination of real river networks.

We are able to discern the ﬁner details of the connec-
tion between stream segment length and tributary num-
bers. Analysis of the placement of side streams along a
stream segment again reveals exponential distributions.
We are then able to postulate a joint probability dis-
tribution for stream segment lengths and the Tokunaga
ratios. The functional form obtained agrees well with
both model and real network data. By further consider-
ing distributions of the number of side streams per unit
length of individual stream segments, we are able to cap-
ture how variations in the separation of side streams are

13

averaged out along higher-order absorbing streams.

By expanding our knowledge of the underlying dis-
tributions through empiricism, modeling and theory, we
obtain a more detailed picture of network structure with
which to compare real and theoretical networks. We have
also further shown that the simple random network mod-
el of Scheidegger has an impressive ability to produce
statistics whose form may then be observed in nature.
Indeed, the only distinction between the two is the exact
value of the scaling exponents and ratios involved since
all distributions match up in functional form.

We end with a brief comment on the work of Cui et
al. [13] who have recently also proposed a stochastic gen-
eralization of Tokunaga’s law. They postulate that the
underlying distribution for the Tµ,ν is a negative binomial
distribution. One parameter additional to T1 and RT , α,
was introduced to reﬂect “regional variability,” i.e., sta-
tistical ﬂuctuations in network structure. This is in the
same spirit as our identiﬁcation of a single parameter ξt.
However, our work disagrees on the nature of the under-
lying distribution of Tµ,ν. We have consistently observed
exponential distributions for Tµ,ν in both model and real
networks.

In closing, by ﬁnding randomness in the spatial distri-
bution of stream segments, we have arrived at the most
basic description of river network architecture. Under-
standing the origin of the exact values of quantities such
as drainage density remains an open problem.

Abstract

We show that distinctive alterations in scaling parameters of Dst index time series occur as a

strong magnetic storm approaches. These alterations reveal a gradual reduction of complexity as

the catastrophic event approaches. The increase of the susceptibility coupled with the transition

from anti-persistent to persistent behavior may indicate that the onset of a severe magnetic storm

is imminent. The preparation of a major magnetic storm could be studied in terms of “Intermittent

Criticality”. The analysis also suggests that the continuous scale invariance is partially broken into

a discrete scale invariance symmetry.

Major magnetospheric disturbances are undoubtedly among the most important phe-

nomena in space physics and also a core subject of space weather. They are relatively rare

events: as in the case of atmospheric storms, earthquakes, solar ﬂares, etc., the occurrence

of geomagnetic storms rapidly decreases as their magnitude grows.

Dst is the disturbance storm time index, computed from an average over 4 magnetic

observatories around the equator, and is considered to represent the magnetospheric ring

current contribution [1]. Since the development of a strong ring current is a deﬁning feature

of magnetic storms, the Dst has been adopted as a proxy for magnetic storm severity [2].

In the context of complex systems self-organized criticality has been associated with

natural hazards [3] such as earthquakes,

landslides and forest-ﬁres. The idea of using

cellular automata to model the magnetospheric activity became popular as observations

showed scale-invariant features. However, the debate between a forced (driven) and / or

self-organized critical magnetosphere is not at all unique [4, 5, 6].

The magnetosphere as a complex system manifests itself in linkages between space

and time, producing scaling patterns and the emergence of fractal structures. We show

that distinctive alterations in associated scaling parameters emerge (e.g., transition from

anti-persistent to persistent behavior) as large magnetospheric disturbances approach (e.g.,

6/11/2001, Dst ≃ −300 nT). The analysis also reveals the existence of discrete scale invari-

ance, a system property invariant under only a discrete set of dilatations [7, 8].

Dst index time series were analyzed using a wavelet analysis technique [9]. In Fig. 1-2,

the Dst time series and the associated wavelet power spectrum are shown, respectively.

If a time series is a temporal fractal then a power-law of the form S(f ) ∝ f −β is obeyed.

S(f ) is the power spectral density and f is the frequency. The quantity S(f )df may be

understood as the contribution to the total power from those components of the time series,

whose frequencies lie in the interval between f and f + df . The spectral scaling exponent

β is a measure of the strength of time correlations.

In a log S(f ) − log f representation

the power spectrum is a line with slope β. The goodness of the ﬁt of a time series to the

power-law is assigned with the linear correlation coeﬃcient, r, of this representation.

A lot of work on complexity has been focused on power-laws, which describe the scal-

ing properties of fractal processes and structures. Here, we examine whether distinctive

alterations in the associated parameters, i.e., r and β, emerge as a major magnetic storm

approaches. For this purpose, the Dst time variations were divided upon successive seg-

2

ments of 16 days and for each of these segments the parameters r and β were estimated and

indicated at the top of the wavelet power spectrum in Fig. 2. (16 days is the shortest time

window we can view here based on the index sampling rate and the deﬁnition of the wavelet

transform.)

The temporal evolution of r (always above 0.94 and reaching values of 0.99 at the end

of the time interval considered here) means that the ﬁt to the power-law is excellent. The
fractal-law (S(f ) ∝ f −β) observed indicates the existence of memory. This means that the

current value of the geomagnetic signal is correlated not only with its most recent value but

also with its long-term history in a scale-invariant, fractal manner, namely the system refers

to its history in order to deﬁne its future. We observe a gradual increase of r as the main

event approaches. This suggests that the fractal character of the underlying processes and

structures becomes clearer with time.

The distribution of β exponent is also shifted to higher values. This shift reveals several

features of the underlying mechanism. As β increases the spatial correlation in the time

series also increases [10]. This behavior indicates a gradual increase of the memory, and

thus a gradual reduction of complexity in the underlying dynamics. This suggests that the

onset of a severe magnetic storm may represent a gradual transition from a less orderly state

to a more orderly state (see also [5]).

Maslov et al.

[11] have formally established the relationship between spatial fractal

behavior and long-range temporal correlations for a broad range of critical phenomena. By

studying the time correlations in the local activity, they show that the temporal and spatial

activity can be described as diﬀerent cuts in the same underlying fractal. In a geometrical

sense, β speciﬁes the strength of the signal’s irregularity as well. The fractal dimension D

is calculated from the relation D = (5 − β)/2 [12], which, after considering the shift of β

to higher values, leads to a decrease of the fractal dimension as the magnetospheric crisis

approaches. This may reﬂect that the action of anisotropy inherent to the system leads to

the appearance of a clear preferred direction of elementary activities just before the main

shock. Theoretical and experimental evidence support the former hypothesis: throughout

the entire main and most of the early recovery phase of magnetic storms the geometry of the

energy ﬂow produces a highly asymmetric ring current conﬁguration [1, 2]. The emergence

of strong anisotropy rationalizes a further reduction of the complexity with time.

The colour-type behavior of the power spectrum density (β > 0) means that the spec-

3

trum manifests more power at low frequencies than at high frequencies. The increase in

the spectral exponent β with time indicates the gradual enhancement of lower frequency

ﬂuctuations. This observation is consistent with the following physical picture: the acti-

vated substorms interact and coalesce to form larger fractal structures, i.e., the events are

initiated at the lowest level of the hierarchy, with the smallest elements merging in turn

to form larger and larger ones. This sign may be considered as candidate precursor of the

forthcoming shock.

The β exponent is related to the Hurst exponent, H, by the formula β = 2H + 1, with

0 < H < 1 (1 < β < 3) for the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) random ﬁeld model [12].

The exponent H characterizes the persistent / anti-persistent properties of the signal [13].

The range 0 < H < 0.5 (1 < β < 2) during the normal period (0 – 80 days) indicates anti-

persistency, reﬂecting that if the ﬂuctuations increase in a period, it is likely to decreasing in

the interval immediately following and vice versa. Physically, this implies that ﬂuctuations

tend to induce stability within the system (negative feedback mechanism). The observed

systematic increase of the H (β) exponent during this stage indicates that the ﬂuctuations

become more correlated with time [14].

We pay attention to the fact that the time series appear persistent properties, 0.5 < H < 1

(2 < β < 3), at 80 – 112 days. This means that if the amplitude of ﬂuctuations increases

in a time interval it is likely to continue increasing in the interval immediately following.

In other words, the system tends toward irreversibility (positive feedback mechanism) [14].

H = 0.5 (β = 2) suggests no correlation between the repeated increments. Consequently,

this particular value takes on a special physical meaning: it marks the transition between

persistent and anti-persistent behavior in the time series.

In Fig. 1 the Dst cumulative square amplitudes are also shown. A signiﬁcant increase in

the rate of energy release as the main geomagnetic storm approaches is observed. This may

show that during the persistent epoch the system is not only near the peak of the magnetic

storm in the sense of having power-law correlations, but also in terms of exhibiting high

susceptibility.

Fractals have dimensions that are in general real numbers. The generalization from the

set of integers to the set of real numbers embodies the transition from the symmetry of

translation invariance to symmetry of scale invariance. Fractals are also described by fractal

dimensions that belong to the complex numbers. In the context of critical phenomena, the

4

complex fractal dimension is associated with a discrete scale invariance (DSI), i.e., to the

invariance of the system or of its properties only under magniﬁcations that are integer powers

of a fundamental ratio. Interestingly, the appearance of DSI signiﬁes a partial symmetry

breaking of a continuous scale invariance and the emergence of DSI on characteristic scales.

DSI manifests itself in data by log-periodic corrections to scaling [7, 8, 15]. The typical

formula for log-periodicity in time is given by E(t) = A + B(tf − t)m{1 + Ccos[ωlog(tf − t) +

φ]}, where E(t) is the cumulative energy released, tf is the time of the main shock (storm

peak), ω is the frequency and φ is just an oﬀset.

We focus on Fig. 1 and in the energy oscillations observed prior to the main magnetic

event (32 – 96 days). One can observe a trace of oscillations modulating the main power-law

behavior in the energy density. In Fig. 3 we ﬁt a power-law with log-periodic oscillations

to the cumulative square Dst amplitudes. It is clear that a law of this form can adequately

describe the observations.

As expected, the log-periodic oscillations are modulated in frequency with a geometric

increase of the frequency on the approach to the time tf : the intermittent accelerations and

quiescences of geomagnetic activity around the power-law acceleration become more closely

spaced as the main event is approached. The aforementioned behavior reﬂects a preparation

stage for major geomagnetic storms, in which pre-storm activities occur at particular discrete

times and not in a continuous fashion: these discontinuities in turn mirror the localized and

threshold nature of the underlying mechanism. It is this “punctuated” physics which gives

rise to the scaling precursors modeled mathematically by the log-periodic correction to

scaling.

By monitoring the temporal evolution of the fractal spectral characteristics in Dst we ﬁnd

that distinctive alterations in the associated scaling parameters indicate a transition from

the normal state to an abnormal state (major magnetic storm) as following: (i) Emergence of

long-range correlations, i.e., appearance of memory eﬀects. This implies a multi-time-scale

cooperative activity of numerous activated geomagnetic events. (ii) Increase of the spatial

correlation in the time series with time. This indicates a gradual transition from a less

orderly state to a more orderly state. (iii) Decrease of the fractal dimension of the variations

with time, i.e., appearance of strong anisotropy in elementary activities.

(iv) Existence

of strong anti-persistent behavior in the ﬁrst epoch of the geomagnetic activity, i.e., prior

to the severe magnetic storm. (v) Decrease of the anti-persistent behavior with time. (vi)

5

Emergence of persistent properties in the “tail” of the time series. (vii) Predominance of large

geomagnetic events with time. (viii) Signiﬁcant acceleration of the energy release as the main

shock approaches, i.e., increase of the susceptibility of the system. (ix) Gradual appearance

of higher frequencies in the spectrum with simultaneous increase of the amplitudes at each

emission rate as the magnetic storm peak approaches, mainly characterizing lower emission

rates.

A question that arises is whether the evolution towards global instability is inevitable

after the appearance of distinctive symptoms in the geomagnetic variations. The emergence

of persistent behavior, the increase of the susceptibility of the system, the predominance

of large geomagnetic events, the coherent ﬂuctuations at all scales, may indicate that the

generation of a very strong magnetic storm becomes, indeed, unavoidable.

The aforementioned crucial footprints (including temporal alterations in associated scal-

ing parameters) distinguish the dynamics of a complex system close to its ﬁnal instability.

These may indicate the following scenario for the generation of a severe magnetic storm.

During the normal period, the system is in a anti-persistent state, with a restricted and

systematically ﬂuctuating correlation length. Long-range correlations gradually build up

through local interactions until they extend throughout the entire system. The smaller geo-

magnetic events are the agents by which longer correlations are established. A population of

small events will advance the correlation length by an amount depending on its magnitude

and magnetosphere state, triggering very strong magnetic storms only if the condition is

right: in a anti-persistent regime a population of small events leads to a decaying activity,

always dying out. In the persistent state is just able to continue “indeﬁnitely”. This ex-

plains in a natural way why not every geomagnetic event can induce geomagnetic activity. A

large geomagnetic event destroys long correlations on its associated network, creating a new

normal period during which the process repeats by rebuilding correlation lengths towards

the next large event. Thus a large shock may act as a sort of “critical point” dividing the

magnetic storm into a period of growing correlations before the great event and a relatively

uncorrelated phase after.

The aforementioned evolution may be overall characterized as “Intermittent Criticality”

[16] that predicts a time-dependent variation in the activity as the “critical point” is ap-

proached, implying, in contrast to self-organized criticality (SOC), a degree of predictability.

The analogies with the dynamics of the SOC model for the magnetosphere have been

6

realized by numerous authors [5, 6]. Characteristically, the scale-free structure of the aurora

is argued to come from a scale-free structure of a SOC magnetosphere [6]. However, numer-

ous authors are cautious with this suggestion. A relevant question, emphasized by Consolini

and Chang [17], is how well the assumption of the SOC model is met in magnetosphere.

We also recall the debate between a driven and an internal origin for intermittent scale-free

dynamics in magnetosphere. Work continues on this issue, which is an example of a generic

problem of complex systems coupled to complex drivers [6]. We think that the results of this

study may help to approach the real dynamics of magnetosphere. In any case the present

study suggests that it can be important to distinguish between SOC and intermittent criti-

cality in the study of the magnetic storm cycle. A proper recognition and understanding of

tuning parameters may lead to the development of improved magnetospheric models having

higher performance reliability. One of the main features in the complexity is the role that

the topological disorder plays in such systems. The range of size scales characterizing het-

erogeneities of the thresholds might be acted as a tuning parameter of the underlying ﬁnal

magnetic storm dynamics.

We bear in mind that our analysis reveals an interesting transition from the anti-persistent

to the persistent regime. The anti-persistent behavior characterizes the magnetosphere

during substorms, while the catastrophic events are in reasonable agreement with persistent

models. We note that Sitnov et al. [5] have also suggested two diﬀerents regimes: while the

substorm activity resembles second-order phase transitions, the largest substorms avalanches

are shown to reveal the features of ﬁrst-order non-equilibrium transitions. The corresponding

pictures in each regime are not in contradiction.

It is important to stress the practical consequence of log-periodic structures. For fore-

casting purpose, it is much more constrained and thus reliable to ﬁt a part of an oscillating

data than a simple power-law which can be quite degenerate especially in the presence of

noise. This idea has been noted and is vigorously investigated in several applied domains,

such as earthquakes, rupture and ﬁnancial crashes [8].

Abstract

The composition of the lower mantle can be investigated by examining densities and seismic
velocities of compositional models as functions of depth. In order to do this, it is necessary to
know the volumes and thermoelastic properties of the compositional constituents under lower
mantle conditions. We determined the thermal equation of state (EoS) of MgSiO3 perovskite
using the non-empirical VIB interatomic potential with molecular dynamics simulations at
pressures and temperatures of the lower mantle. We ﬁt our P-V-T results to a thermal EoS of
the form P (V, T ) = P0(V, T0) + ∆Pth(T ), where T0 = 300 K and P0 is the isothermal Universal
EoS. The thermal pressure ∆Pth can be represented by a linear relationship ∆Pth = a + bT . We
ﬁnd V0 = 165.40 ˚A3, KT0 = 273 GPa, K ′
pressures of 0-140 GPa and temperatures of 300-3000 K. By ﬁxing V0 to the experimentally
determined value of 162.49 ˚A3 and calculating density and bulk sound velocity proﬁles along a
lower mantle geotherm, we ﬁnd that the lower mantle cannot consist solely of (Mg,Fe)SiO3
perovskite with XM g ranging from 0.9-1.0. Using pyrolitic compositions of 67 mol% perovskite
(XM g = 0.93-0.96) and 33 mol% magnesiow¨ustite (XM g = 0.82-0.86), however, we obtained
density and velocity proﬁles that are in excellent agreement with seismological models for a
reasonable geotherm.

Introduction

By comparing density and seismic velocity proﬁles
of compositional with seismological models, it is pos-
sible to investigate the composition of the Earth’s
lower mantle. Therefore, an understanding of the
high pressure, high temperature properties and equa-
tion of state (EoS) of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite is vi-
tal to our understanding of the lower mantle, as this
mineral accounts for perhaps two-thirds of the miner-
alogy of this region [Bina, 1998], and one-third of the
volume of the entire planet. Experiments have been
performed up to pressures approaching those found
at the base of the mantle, but direct coverage of the
lower mantle geotherm has been limited to perhaps
the uppermost one-third (Figure 1). Experiments in-
clude resistively heated multi-anvil apparati
[Wang
et al., 1994; Kato et al., 1995; Utsumi et al., 1995; Fu-
namori et al., 1996], diamond anvil cells (DACs) at
ambient temperature [Kudoh et al., 1987; Ross and
Hazen, 1990], resistively heated DACs
[Mao et al.,
1991; Saxena et al., 1999], laser heated DACs [Knittle
and Jeanloz 1987; Fiquet et al., 1998, 2000], and shock
wave experiments
[Duﬀy and Ahrens, 1993; Akins
and Ahrens, 1999].

Theoretical methods, such as those used here, per-
mit the investigation of thermodynamic and ther-
moelastic properties of minerals at high pressures
and temperatures. Previous theoretical work on or-
thorhombic MgSiO3 perovskite (Mg-pv) has been
done using molecular dynamics (MD) using the semi-
empirical potential of Matsui [1988] at 0-1000 K and
0-10 GPa (at 300 K) [Matsui, 1988] and 300-5500 K
and 0-400 GPa [Belonoshko, 1994; Belonoshko and
Dubrovinsky, 1996], and combined with lattice dy-
namics at 500-3000 K and 0-100 GPa [Patel et al.,
1996]. Wolf and Bukowinski [1987] used a rigid ion
Modiﬁed Electron Gas (MEG) model at 0-800 K and
0-150 GPa, while Hemley et al.
[1987] used a MEG
model combined with shell stabilized ion charge den-
sities at 0-2500 K and 0-200 GPa. Cohen [1987] did
quasiharmonic lattice dynamics calculations from 0-
3000 K and 0-150 GPa using the Potential Induced
Breathing (PIB) model. First principles static lattice
calculations (T = 0 K) have also been done up to
pressures of 150 GPa, using plane-wave pseudopoten-
tial (PWPP) MD [Wentzcovitch et al., 1995] and the
Linearized Augmented Plane Wave (LAPW) method
[Stixrude and Cohen, 1993]. Karki et al. [1997] also
used the PWPP method to examine the athermal
elastic moduli of Mg-pv.

In addition to the equation of state, the thermo-
dynamic stability of perovskite in the lower mantle is
an open question and has been studied with experi-
mental and theoretical methods. Work by Meade et
al. [1995], Saxena et al. [1996, 1998] and Dubrovin-
[1998] indicate that perovskite will break
sky et al.
down to oxides under lower mantle conditions. The
thermodynamic analysis of Stixrude and Bukowinski
[1992] and the experimental work of Serghiou et al.
[1998], however, suggest that it will not.

We used MD simulations using the non-empirical
Variational Induced Breathing (VIB) model, similar
to the model of Wolf and Bukowinski [1988], to inves-
tigate the properties and EoS of Mg-pv at pressures
(0-140 GPa) and temperatures (300-3000 K) that
cover the bulk of the conditions found in the lower
mantle. Newton’s equations of motion are solved as
functions of time, and equilibrium properties are ob-
tained as time averages over a suﬃciently long inter-
val. This accounts for all orders of anharmonicity,
but not for quantum lattice dynamics eﬀects. Thus
our results are more appropriate at high tempera-
tures above the Debye temperature (1076 K [An-
derson, 1998]), and entirely suitable for the Earth’s
mantle. We then used our results, combining them
with data for other components and phases where
appropriate, to calculate density and seismic veloc-
ity proﬁles along a geothermal gradient for diﬀerent
compositional models. These proﬁles were then com-
pared with proﬁles from a reference Earth model in
order to test the compositional models’ ﬁtness for the
lower mantle.

Method

MD simulations were performed on supercells of
540-2500 atoms of orthorhombic (Pbnm) Mg-pv using
the non-empirical VIB potential. VIB is a Gordon-
Kim type model
[Gordon and Kim, 1972] where
the potential is obtained by overlapping ionic charge
densities which are computed using the local den-
sity approximation (LDA)
[Hedin and Lundqvist,
1971]. The total energy is a sum of (i) the self-
energy of each atom, (ii) the long-range electrostatic
energy computed using the Ewald method, and (iii)
the short-range interaction energy, i.e., the sum of
the kinetic, short-range electrostatic, and exchange-
correlation overlap energies from the LDA. Free oxy-
gen ions are not stable, and are stabilized in VIB by
surrounding them with Watson spheres with charges
equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the ions,

e.g., 2+ spheres for O2−. Interactions are obtained
for overlapping ion pairs at diﬀerent distances with
diﬀerent Watson sphere radii for each oxygen. The
interactions are ﬁt with a 23 parameter analytical
expression as functions of the interatomic distance r
and Ui = zi/Ri, where Ui, zi, and Ri are the Wat-
son sphere potential, charge, and radius for atom i.
For each oxygen i, Ri is adjusted to minimize the to-
tal energy at each time step. This gives an eﬀective
many-body potential. The oxygen ions respond to
changes in their environment. For example, they are
compressed at high pressures relative to low pressures.
Previous work on Mg-pv using the related PIB model
gave an equation of state in excellent agreement with
experiment [Cohen, 1987]. Also, work using VIB on
MgO has shown that this model accurately predicts
EoS and thermal properties [Inbar and Cohen, 1995].
Nominally charged ions give semi-quantitative, but
less accurate, results than desired for Mg-pv. This
is due to a small degree of covalent relative to ionic
bonding as revealed by electronic structure calcula-
tions of cubic (Pm3m) Mg-pv performed using the
ﬁrst-principles LAPW method [Cohen et al., 1989].
These calculations show that while the Mg is nearly
a perfectly spherical Mg2+ ion, there is some charge
transfer from O to Si and a small covalent bond charge
(involving ≪ 0.1 electrons) between Si and O. By
varying the ionic charges on Si (3.1+ to 3.55+) and
O (1.70- to 1.85-) to account for the covalency, but
otherwise using the same methods as before, we com-
pared the resulting zero temperature pressure-volume
data to the LAPW results of Stixrude and Cohen
[1993]. The best agreement was found with Si3.4+
and O1.8−. Using these charges, the resulting poten-
tial gives excellent agreement with the octahedral ro-
tation energetics obtained using the LAPW method
[Stixrude and Cohen, 1993; Hemley and Cohen, 1996]
(Figure 2).

MD runs were performed for 20 ps with a 1 fs

scheme [Gear, 1971] in the constant pressure-tempera-
ture ensemble using the thermostat and barostat of

tated octahedra of Stixrude and Cohen, [1993]. Sub-
sequent runs at higher pressures or temperatures used

ensembles were obtained in ∼2000 iterations for the
genesis run and in < 1000 for subsequent ones.

which applies to a wide range of solids at high T, in-
cluding minerals, alkali metals, and noble gas solids
[Anderson, 1984]. The linearity of ∆Pth in T starts
at 300 K [Masuda and Anderson, 1995] in miner-
als. There should be a small anharmonic correction at
high T, which results in an additional c T 2 term in (6),
which is often suﬃciently small so that it can be ne-
glected [Anderson, 1984]. Indeed, including the c T 2
term did not statistically improve our ﬁts. Likewise,
neither did including volumetric compression terms
(e.g., Jackson and Rigden, [1996]).

Results

MD calculations were performed at 46 pressure-
temperature points, ranging from 0-140 GPa and 300-
3000 K, thus covering the P-T conditions of the lower
mantle (Table 1). Axial ratios b/a and c/a follow
smooth trends at lower mantle pressures (Figure 3a-
b), with deviations away from the Pbnm structure
seen at P ≤ 12 GPa and T ≥ 2400 K. At 3000 K
and 12 GPa, the structure can be observed to move
towards cubic lattice parameters (b/a → 1, c/a →
√2 ). This point in particular is close to the melting
curve of Mg-pv [Heinz and Jeanloz, 1987; Knittle and
Jeanloz 1989; Poirier, 1989] and such temperature-
induced phase transitions have been predicted for Mg-
pv by MD [Wolf and Bukowinski, 1987] and lattice
dynamics
[Matsui and Price, 1991]. In addition, it
has been found for RbCaF3 and KMnF3 perovskites
by MD simulations
[Lewis and L´epine, 1989; Nos´e
and Klein, 1989], and observed experimentally in the
ﬂuoride perovskite neighborite (NaMgF3)
[Chao et
al., 1961]. Regardless of these changes, the volumes
are well-behaved as functions of pressure and temper-
ature (Figure 3c) and no other structural anomalies
or melting were encountered during runs at other P,T
points.

The resulting P-V-T EoS ﬁts and their reduced
χ2 values are given in Table 2. Both the Birch-
Murnaghan and Universal EoSs are in excellent agree-
ment with experimental results. As for the accuracy

Figure 3

of our thermal pressure expression, RMS diﬀerences
between volumes found using equation (1) for either
EoS and those found using isothermal EoSs are on
the order of 10−3 ˚A3. As for the diﬀerences between
the two equation of state forms, Jeanloz [1988] com-
pared them over moderate compressions and found
that they are quite similar. More recent work by Co-
hen et al. [2000] supports this, but they found that for
large (> 30%) strains and for determining parameters
such as V0, KT0, and K ′
T0, the Universal EoS works
best, and so, for the rest of our analyses, we use that
here. However, given that under the pressure range
studied, compressions will be no greater that 25%,
so we can conﬁdently compare our results with those
of others that were found with the Birch-Murnaghan
EoS.

Once we determined the EoS parameters, we de-
termined volumes for Mg-pv over a wide P-T range
(-10-150 GPa, 0-3300 K). Using this extended data
set, we were determined the isothermal bulk modu-

and q using equations 7, 8, 11, and 10. We found

lus (cid:2)KT = −V (cid:0) ∂P
∂V(cid:1)T(cid:3) at those points, and α, δT , γ,
(cid:0) ∂K
∂T(cid:1)P =0 = -0.0251 GPa/K, close to those found ex-

perimentally, -0.023 GPa/K [Wang et al., 1994] and
-0.027 GPa/K [Fiquet et al., 1998], as well as one
found by the inversion of multiple experimental data
sets, -0.021 GPa/K [Jackson and Rigden, 1996].

Figure 4 shows α at pressures from 0 to 140 GPa. Figure 4

Experimental results shown have higher T slopes, as
well as higher extrapolated values for most tempera-
tures, though an average value found by Jackson and
Rigden [1996] at zero GPa of 2.6× 10−5K−1 over 300-
1660 K matches our value over the same T range ex-
actly. Kato et al.
[1995] found an average value of
2.0 ± 0.4 × 10−5K−1 over 298-1473 K and 25 GPa,
close to our average value of 1.89 × 10−5K−1 at the
same conditions. The lack of quantum eﬀects in our
MD results can be seen at low temperatures; instead
of tending towards zero at zero temperature, α re-
mains large. δT increases with T, but decreases as
P increases (Figure 5). The dependency of δT on T Figure 5
decreases as a function of P, with convergence to a
value of 2.87 at ∼130 GPa, similar to the high pres-
sure behavior in MgO found by the same MD method
[Inbar and Cohen, 1995]. Our value of δT = 3.79 at
ambient conditions is in excellent agreement with the
experimentally derived value of Wang et al. [1994] of
3.73, though it is lower than the value of 4.5, found by
Masuda and Anderson [1995] from the experimental
data of Utsumi et al. [1995]. Other theoretical deter-
minations of δT are much higher, however. Hama and

Figure 6

Figure 7

Suito [1998a] found a value of 5.21, based on calcula-
tions using the LAPW results of Stixrude and Cohen
[1993] and the Debye approximation for lattice vibra-
tion. Using MD and semi-empirical potentials [Mat-
sui, 1988], Belonoshko and Dubrovinsky [1996] found
δT = 5.80, and Patel et al. [1996] found δT = 7.0 us-
ing the same potentials, combining MD with lattice
dynamics. Anderson [1998], using Debye theory, cal-
culated zero pressure values ranging from 4.98 at 400
K to ∼4 at 1000 K ≤ T ≤ 1800 K, coming close to
our values at those temperatures.

The Gr¨uneisen parameter also increases as a func-
tion of T and decreases as a function of P, and ap-
proaches a value of 1 at pressures of 130-140 GPa (Fig-
ure 6). Our value of 1.33 at zero P and 300 K matches
well with Wang et al.’s [1994] value of 1.3 and Utsumi
et al.’s [1995]/Masuda and Anderson’s [1995] value of
1.45. Stixrude et al.
[1992], using the experimental
data of Mao et al. [1991], found a higher value of γ
= 1.96. Values determined by the inversion of multi-
ple experimentally determined P-V-T data sets match
well also: 1.5 [Bina, 1995], 1.33 [Jackson and Rigden,
1996], and 1.42 [Shim and Duﬀy, 2000]. Two shock
wave studies ﬁnd a value of 1.5 [Duﬀy and Ahrens,
1993; Akins and Ahrens, 1999] based on limited data
sets:
four for the former (with q ﬁxed equal to 1)
and two for the latter. Values of γ from theoretical
studies range from very close to ours, 1.279 [Hama
and Suito, 1998a] and 1.44 [Hemley et al., 1987], to
1.97 [Belonoshko and Dubrovinsky, 1996; Patel et al.,
1996]. Anderson’s [1998] zero pressure, 300 K value
of 1.52 is somewhat higher than ours, but at 400-1800
K his values of ∼1.4 are very close to ours.

The volume dependence of γ, q, is 1.03 at 300 K
(Figure 7). Our equation of state form, with ∆Pth
linear in T and independent of volume, constrains q
= 1 if the isochoric heat capacity CV = 3nR, the clas-
sical harmonic value. As T increases, we ﬁnd that q
increases to a value of 1.07 at 3000 K due to anhar-
monicity. Values from inverted experimental data sets
range from 1.0 [Bina, 1995] to 2.0 [Shim and Duﬀy,
2000]. Stixrude et al.
[1992] found a high q value
of 2.5 to go along with their value for γ. Akins and
Ahrens’s [1999] value was even higher, q = 4.0 ± 1.0
with CV = 5nR, but these are preliminary conclu-
sions based on limited data. Patel et al. [1996] found
a value of 3.0 at 0 GPa, decreasing to 1.7 at 100 GPa
using a combination of molecular and lattice dynam-
ics. Anderson’s [1998] Debye calculations gave val-
ues close to unity at T ≥ 1000 K, with q decreasing
slightly with increasing T, to 0.82 at 1800 K.

Discussion and Conclusions

Taking sets of experimental P-V-T data, we ﬁt the
high temperature data [Fiquet et al., 1998, 2000; Sax-
ena et al., 1999] and available experimental MgSiO3
data to our thermal Universal EoS form (Table 2) in
order to have consistent bases for comparison. The
resulting ﬁts have higher statistical uncertainties but
compare well with our results. Volumes calculated
along the lower mantle geothermal gradient of Brown
and Shankland [1981], which has a starting T of 1873
K at 670 km (Figure 1), show that those calculated
from our EoS are 3 to 4 ˚A3 per unit cell larger, about
2.5%, than those calculated from the inverted experi-
mental data sets (Figure 8). This corresponds to den- Figure 8
sity diﬀerences of ∼0.1 g/cm3. This is the opposite
of the typical error of the local density approximation
to density functional theory, on which our method is
based. The larger volume is due to the choice of ionic
charges and other model assumptions. If we ﬁx V0
to the experimentally determined value of 162.49 ˚A3
[Mao et al., 1991], but otherwise use our EoS param-
eters, our calculated volumes are very close, within
1%, to the volumes derived from the inverted exper-
imental data sets. The comparisons also improve as
pressure increases. To compare our model with other
zero temperature theoretically-derived EoSs, we cal-
culated volumes at 0 K from 0-140 GPa and ﬁt an
isothermal Universal EoS to them (Table 3).

Table 3

Compositional models of the lower mantle can
be tested against seismological models by examin-
ing densities and seismic wave velocities as func-
tions of depth. Candidates include pyrolite [Ring-
wood, 1975] and chondritic or pure perovskite models.
[Bina and Silver,
Studies support both the former
1990; Stacey, 1996] and latter
[Butler and Ander-
son, 1978; Stixrude et al., 1992], though uncertainties
in the thermodynamic parameters of the constituent
minerals make it diﬃcult to resolve this question with
certainty.
Indeed, several studies have been able
to support both models depending on whether high
(pure perovskite) or low (pyrolite) values of α and δT
or γ and q are used [Zhao and Anderson, 1994; An-
derson et al., 1995; Karki and Stixrude, 1999].

Calculating the densities of Mg-pv along a geother-
[Brown and Shankland, 1981] (Fig-

mal gradient
ure 9a), we see that they are ∼0.25 g/cm3 (∼5%) too Figure 9
low compared with the ak135-f seismological model
[Kennett et al., 1995; Montagner and Kennett, 1996].

The calculated bulk sound velocities, Vϕ = pKS/ρ,
where KS = KT (1 + γα T ), are, in turn, ∼0.6-0.7

km/s (7-8%) too high (Figure 9b). Using the experi-
mentally determined value of V0 = 162.49 ˚A3 [Mao et
al., 1991] in place of our calculated value does increase
the densities somewhat, but not enough to match the
ak135-f values.

As the perovskite found in the lower mantle should
be a solid solution of the Mg and Fe end-members, we
added iron by adjusting density by

ρ (XF e) = ρ (0)(1 + 0.269 XF e)

(12)

[Mao et al., 1991].

[Jeanloz and Thompson, 1983], but did not change
the bulk moduli
Including 10
mol% Fe does cause densities to agree with the seis-
mological values (Figure 10a), but the bulk sound ve-
locities are still much too high (Figure 10b). Conse-
quently, we ﬁnd that the lower mantle cannot consist
solely of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite.

We also tested pyrolitic compositions consisting
of mixtures of perovskite and magnesiow¨ustite (mw).
Densities of mw were calculated using the thermody-
namic data set of Fei et al. [1991], as well as KT s for
the Mg end-member. KSs were then calculated using
the relation

V (P0, T )(cid:21)δT
α(P, T ) = α(P0, T )(cid:20) V (P, T )

,

(13)

with δT and γ from Inbar and Cohen [1995]. Iron was
accounted for in KS via the relationship

KS (XF e) = KS (0) + 17 XF e

(14)

[Jeanloz and Thompson, 1983]. XMg = 0.93-0.96
for pv and 0.82-0.86 for mw [Katsura and Ito, 1996;
Martinez et al., 1997] were used. Densities and bulk
sound velocities were calculated using Voigt-Reuss-
Hill averaging for two simpliﬁed pyrolite models (high
[1] and low [2] Fe content) consisting of 67 mol% pv
and 33 mol% mw and were found to be in excellent
agreement with the seismological model. (Figure 11).
The two pyrolite models have partitioning coeﬃcients

Experimental evidence suggests that for such a bulk
composition, K pv−mw
F e−Mg should increase in the mantle
from ∼0.20 (660 km) to ∼0.35 (1500 km), with Xpv
Mg

fall in-between the results of those shown in Figure
11. Given the range of Fe-Mg partitioning between
perovskite and magnesiow¨ustite under the appropri-
ate pressure and temperature conditions, we ﬁnd py-
rolite to be the most likely compositional model for
the lower mantle.

Given that other components (Al, Fe3+) and phases
(CaSiO3 perovskite) should be present in the lower
mantle, we do not expect exact agreement of a sim-
pliﬁed pyrolite model with any seismological model.
It is believed that, under lower mantle conditions,
Al2O3 is mainly incorporated into the Mg-pv struc-
ture [Irifune, 1994; Wood, 2000]. Generally, the eﬀect
of the incorporation of Al into Mg-pv on its physical
properties has been considered small, e.g., Weidner
and Wang [1998]. However, Al, unlike Fe, causes
signiﬁcant distortion in the Mg-pv lattice
[O’Neill
and Jeanloz, 1994], which may aﬀect the compress-
ibility. Recent experimental work by Zhang and Wei-
dner [1999], at pressure of up to 10 GPa and tempera-
tures of up to 1073 K, indicates that, compared with
MgSiO3, Mg-pv with 5 mol% Al has a smaller KT
value (232-236 GPa) and a (∂KT /∂T )P value more
than double that in magnitude. The values for α0,
(∂α/∂T )P , and δT are also larger. Smaller bulk mod-
uli and the higher density (0.2% at 300 K and 0 GPa)
would cause seismic velocities to decrease. In addi-
tion, the presence of Al tends to equalize the par-
titioning of Fe into perovskite and magnesiow¨ustite
and may allow garnet to coexist with perovskite in
the uppermost ∼100 km of the lower mantle [Wood
and Rubie, 1996; Wood, 2000]. These partitioning
experiments, however, were done at high fO2 , so it
is uncertain how applicable they are to the mantle.
The eﬀect of the presence of Fe3+ in Mg-pv on the
EoS and elasticity, while known for defect concentra-
tions and electrostatic charge balance [McCammon,
1997, 1998], is unknown. As for Ca-pv, experimental
data suggest that its elastic properties are in excel-
lent agreement with seismological models, and thus
would be invisible in the lower mantle [Wang et al.,
1996; Hama and Suito, 1998b].

Performing MD calculations over the range pres-
sures and temperatures found in the Earth’s mantle,
we ﬁnd a thermal EoS that is in excellent agreement
with experimental results. Thermodynamic parame-
ters can be derived that agree well with experimen-
tally determined values and that can be conﬁdently
interpolated to conditions found in the lower mantle.
Moreover, no solid-solid phase transitions or melting
were found during the runs under lower mantle condi-

tions, so orthorhombic MgSiO3 perovskite should be
stable to the core-mantle boundary. Using these re-
sults, we ﬁnd that pyrolite with K pv−mw
F e−Mg = 0.26-0.34
is the most likely compositional model for the lower
mantle.

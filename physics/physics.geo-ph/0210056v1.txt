Abstract

Using a catalog of seismicity for Southern California, we measure how the number of triggered
earthquakes increases with the earthquake magnitude. The trade-oﬀ between this scaling and
the distribution of earthquake magnitudes controls the relative role of small compared to large
earthquakes. We show that seismicity triggering is driven by the smallest earthquakes, which
trigger fewer aftershocks than larger earthquakes, but which are much more numerous. We
propose that the non-trivial scaling of the number of aftershocks emerges from the fractal spatial
distribution of aftershocks.

Introduction

Large shallow earthquakes are always followed by
aftershocks, that are due to the redistribution of the
stress induced by the mainshock. The number of af-
tershocks nM triggered by a mainshock of magnitude
M has been proposed to scale with M as [Utsu, 1969;
Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1987; Kagan, 1991; Reasen-
berg, 1985; 1999; Singh and Suarez, 1988; Ogata,
1988; Reasenberg and Jones, 1989; Yamanaka and
Shimazaki, 1990; Davis and Frohlich, 1991; Molchan
and Dmitrieva, 1992; Hainzl et al., 2000; Drakatos et
al., 2001; Felzer et al., 2002]

nM ∼ 10αM .

(1)

This relation accounts for the fact that large earth-
quakes trigger much more aftershocks than small
earthquakes. A similar relation holds for the distribu-
tion of earthquake magnitudes ρ(M ) [Gutenberg and
Richter, 1949] given by

ρ(M ) ∼ 10

−bM

,

(2)

with b ≈ 1, which implies that small earthquakes are
much more frequent than large earthquakes.

Because large earthquakes release more energy and
trigger more aftershocks than smaller earthquakes, it
is usually accepted that interactions between earth-
quakes and earthquake triggering are dominated by
the largest earthquakes. However, because they are
much more frequent that larger earthquakes, small
earthquakes are also just as important as large earth-
quakes in redistributing the tectonic forces if b = 1
[Hanks, 1992]. Other quantities, such as the Benioﬀ
strain ǫ ∼ 100.75M , are dominated by small earth-
quakes.

The α-exponent is an important parameter of earth-
quake interaction that is used in many stochastic
models of seismicity or prediction algorithms [Kagan
and Knopoﬀ, 1987; Kagan, 1991; Reasenberg, 1985;
1999; Ogata, 1988; Reasenberg and Jones, 1989; Con-
sole and Murru, 2001; Felzer et al., 2002]. This pa-
rameter controls the nature of the seismic activity,
that is, the relative role of small compared to large
earthquakes. While there is a signiﬁcant amount of
literature on the b-value, very few studies have mea-
sured accurately the α exponent in real seismicity
data. Many studies use α = b without justiﬁcation
[Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1987; Reasenberg and Jones,
1989; Davis and Frohlich, 1991; Console and Murru,
2001; Felzer et al., 2002]. In this case, small earth-
quakes are just as important as large earthquakes for

2

the triggering process. Using (1) and (2), the global
number of aftershocks triggered by all earthquakes of
magnitude M scales as

N (M ) ∼ ρ(M ) nM ∼ 10(α−b)M ,

(3)

and is indeed independent of M in the case α = b.
In the case α < b, aftershock triggering is controlled
by the smallest earthquakes, while the largest earth-
quakes dominate if α > b.

A few studies measured directly α from aftershocks
sequences, using a ﬁt of the number of aftershocks
as a function of the mainshock magnitude [Singh
and Suarez, 1988; Yamanaka and Shimazaki, 1990;
Molchan and Dmitrieva, 1992; Drakatos et al., 2001].
These studies yield α-value close to 1, but the lim-
ited range of the mainshock magnitude considered
and the large scatter of the number of aftershocks
per mainshock do not allow an accurate estimation of
α. The case α = b also explains another well docu-
mented property of aftershocks, known as Bath’s Law
[Bath, 1965; Drakatos et al., 2001; Felzer et al., 2002;
Console et al., 2002], which states that the diﬀerence
between the mainshock magnitude and its largest af-
tershock is on average close to 1, independently of
the mainshock magnitude. Again, the limited range
of mainshock magnitudes used in these studies and
possible biases in the method of data selection [Vere-
Jones, 1969; Console et al., 2002] does not allow one
to test the dependence of the magnitude diﬀerence as
a function of the mainshock magnitude.

Other studies measured α indirectly using a stochas-
tic triggering model [Ogata, 1988; Kagan, 1991; Guo
and Ogata, 1997] based only on the Gutenberg-Richter
and Omori laws [Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1987; Ogata,
1988]. This model assumes that each earthquake
above a magnitude threshold m0 can trigger after-
shocks, with a rate that increases with its magnitude
according to (1), and decays with time according to
Omori’s law [Omori, 1894]. In this model, the seis-
micity rate is the result of the whole cascade of direct
and secondary aftershocks, that is, aftershocks of af-
tershocks, aftershocks of aftershocks of aftershocks,
and so on. Using this model, α can be measured
using a maximum likelihood method [Ogata, 1988;
Kagan, 1991; Guo and Ogata, 1997]. The α-values
obtained from the inversion of this model are not well
constrained due to the small number of events avail-
able, and to a possible non-stationarity of the process.
For instance, Guo and Ogata [1997] analyzed 34 af-
tershock sequences in Japan and measured α in the
range [0.2-1.9] with a mean value of 0.86. Moreover,

these studies do not take into account the inﬂuence
of earthquakes below the detection threshold, which
may signiﬁcantly bias the estimation of α.

The behavior of the triggering model is controlled
by the branching ratio ν, deﬁned as the average
over all mainshock magnitudes of the number of af-
tershocks per mainshock [Helmstetter and Sornette,
2002]. The sub-critical regime ν < 1 is a stable sta-
tionary regime, while the seismicity blows up expo-
nentially in the super-critical regime if 1 < ν < ∞.
The case α ≥ b yields ν = ∞ [Helmstetter and Sor-
nette, 2002]. In this singular regime, the seismicity
rate goes to inﬁnity in ﬁnite time tc as 1/(tc − t)m
[Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002]. Such a power-law
increase of seismic activity can describe the acceler-
ation of the deformation preceding material failure,
as well as a starquake sequence [Sornette and Helm-
stetter, 2002]. This explosive regime cannot however
describe a stationary seismic activity. Thus, the α-
value should not be ﬁxed equal to b in order to predict
or to model seismic activity. Because α is a crucial
parameter of stochastic seismicity models, it is very
important to have an accurate estimation of α. In the
sequel, we propose a new eﬃcient method of estima-
tion of α.

Estimation of α for Southern
California seismicity

We use a superposed epoch analysis to estimate the
rate of aftershocks triggered on average by a main-
shock of magnitude between M and M + ∆M , for
diﬀerent ranges of the mainshock magnitude M . In
each magnitude range [M, M + ∆M ], we superpose
all aftershock sequences whose mainshock magnitude
is in the range [M, M + ∆M ]. We use the seismic-
ity catalog of Southern California Data Center, which
covers the time period 1932-2000, and which is almost
complete above M = 3 for this time period.

The deﬁnition of an aftershock contains unavoid-
ably a degree of arbitrariness because the qualiﬁcation
of an earthquake as an aftershock requires the speci-
ﬁcation of time and space windows. Since there is no
widely accepted criteria to deﬁne aftershocks [Gard-
ner and Knopoﬀ, 1974; Reasenberg, 1985; Molchan
and Dmitrieva, 1992], we test diﬀerent proposed cri-
teria.

1. We select all earthquakes that occurred at a dis-
tance from the mainshock less than R, where
R is independent of M . This method has the
advantage of not introducing by hand any scal-

3

ing between the aftershock zone and the main-
shock magnitude. However, it may overestimate
the number of aftershocks of the smallest main-
shocks if R is too large, or underestimate the
number of aftershocks of the largest mainshock
if R is too small.

2. We use a distance R increasing with the main-
shock magnitude, because the aftershock zone is
usually found to scale with the rupture length
[Utsu, 1961; Kagan, 2002]. We use R = 0.01 ×
100.5M km, which is close to the rupture length
of a mainshock of magnitude M . For small
mainshock magnitudes, this choice would lead
to unacceptable values of R smaller than the
location error, and thus to underestimate the
number of aftershocks of small mainshocks. There-
fore, we impose R > 10 km, larger than the
location error.

There is also no consensus on the deﬁnition of an
earthquake as a mainshock. We need to select after-
shocks triggered directly or indirectly by a mainshock,
but not aﬀected by the seismic activity preceding this
mainshock. Therefore, we do not consider as a main-
shock an earthquake which was preceded by a larger
earthquake in a time window T and at a distance
smaller than D. We use the same time window T to
deﬁne aftershocks and mainshocks. The value of D
is ﬁxed equal to 50 km, roughly the size of the after-
shock zone of the largest earthquake in the catalog,
to remove the inﬂuence of all large earthquakes that
have occurred before the mainshock. We do not reject
mainshocks that are followed by a larger event, and
which would usually be considered as a foreshock, be-
cause it would lead to underestimate the number of
aftershocks of small mainshocks.

The results obtained for T = 1 year, R = 0.01 ×
100.5M km and D = 50 km are presented on Fig-
ure 1. We estimate the aftershock rate nM (t) using
all earthquakes that occurred in the space-time win-
dow R, T after an earthquake of magnitude in the
range [M, M + 0.5] (see Figure 1a). The same decay
rate with time is observed for all mainshock magni-
tudes, but the number of aftershocks increases expo-
nentially with M . All the curves for diﬀerent magni-
tudes can be collapsed onto a single master curve by
dividing the seismicity rate by the factor 10αM with
α = 0.82 (Figure 1b). This conﬁrms that the scaling
of the rate of aftershocks with M follows (1). This
method is much more accurate than previous studies
which determined the scaling of nM with M using the

cumulative number of aftershocks [Singh and Suarez,
1988; Yamanaka and Shimazaki, 1990; Molchan and
Dmitrieva, 1992; Drakatos et al., 2001]. Selecting af-
tershocks within a disk of ﬁxed radius R = 50 km
for all mainshock magnitudes yields a slightly smaller
value α = 0.75. Decreasing R leads to a smaller value
of α because it underestimates the number of after-
shocks of the largest mainshocks which have a rupture
size larger than R. When increasing R between 5 and
100 km, the value of α ﬁrst increases with R and then
saturates around α = 0.75 for R ≥ 30 km. There is
no simple statistical test to estimate the uncertainty
of α. Therefore, we have divided the catalog in two
sub-catalogs for the time periods 1932-1965 and 1975-
2001 in order to estimate the uncertainty of α. We
have also tested the inﬂuence of the parameters R and
T used to deﬁne aftershocks and mainshocks. All val-
ues of α, for reasonable values of the parameters R in
the range 30 − 100 km and T between 0.1 and 5 yrs,
and for diﬀerent time periods of the catalog, are in
the range [0.7 − 0.9].

We have estimated the b-value of the Gutenberg-
Richter law (2) for the time period 1980-2000, which is
complete down to magnitude 2. For this larger data
set we obtain a more accurate value of b = 1.041,
with a very small theoretical standard deviation of
0.003, estimated by the maximum likelihood method.
We have also tested that the magnitude distribution
ρ(M ) is the same for all aftershocks, whatever the
mainshock magnitude. Figure 2 shows the magni-
tude distribution of aftershocks for diﬀerent ranges of
the mainshock magnitude, using the same data than
in Figure 1. This Figure shows that the magnitude
distribution of aftershocks is independent of the main-
shock magnitude, i.e., a large aftershock can be trig-
gered by a small earthquake.

Our results suggest that α is signiﬁcantly smaller
than the b exponent of the magnitude distribution.
We cannot however completely exclude the possibility
that α might be larger than b, because the estimation
of α might be biased by the non-stationarity of the
process, or by the method of identiﬁcation of after-
shocks. We will report in a following work a more
detailed estimation of α and its temporal and spatial
variability.

Model

We now propose a simple explanation for this non-
trivial scaling of the number of aftershocks with the
mainshock magnitude, and we suggest that α can be

4

related to the fractal structure of the spatial distri-
bution of aftershocks. It is widely accepted that the
aftershock zone scales with the rupture length [Utsu,
1961; Kagan, 2002]. Indeed, the aftershock zone is of-
ten taken as an estimate of the rupture length. This
relationship can be rationalized by the expression of
the stress change induced by the mainshock. While
the area aﬀected by the stress variation induced by
an earthquake increases with the rupture length, the
stress drop is independent of the mainshock magni-
tude [Kanamori and Anderson, 1975]. The stress
variation at a distance from the mainshock propor-
tional to the fault length L is thus independent of
the mainshock magnitude, neglecting the eﬀect of the
ﬁnite width of the crust and the visco-elastic defor-
mation in the lower-crust. Therefore, assuming that
aftershocks are triggered by the stress change induced
by the mainshock, the density of aftershocks triggered
at a distance up to R ≈ L from the mainshock is inde-
pendent of the mainshock magnitude. The increase of
the number of aftershocks with the mainshock magni-
tude results only from the increase in the aftershock
zone size with the rupture length.

The rupture length is usually related to the mag-

nitude by [Kanamori and Anderson, 1975]

L ∼ 100.5M

.

(4)

The same relation thus holds between the aftershock
zone size R and the mainshock magnitude.

In order to estimate the scaling of the number of
aftershocks with the rupture length, we need to make
an assumption about the spatial distribution of after-
shocks around the mainshock. Assuming that after-
shocks are uniformly distributed on the fault plane,
and using (4), the number of aftershocks triggered by
a mainshock of magnitude M is given by [Yamanaka
and Shimazaki, 1990]

nM ∼ L2 ∼ 10M

(5)

and thus leads to α = 1. The value α = 0.5 obtained
for a numerical model of seismicity suggests that in
this model aftershocks are triggered mostly on the
edge of the fracture area of the mainshock [Hainzl et
al., 2000]. Our result α = 0.8 for Southern California
seismicity implies that aftershocks are distributed nei-
ther uniformly on the rupture plane nor on the edge
of the rupture, but rather on a fractal structure of di-
mension D < 2. Using the deﬁnition of the capacity
fractal dimension, the number of aftershocks is

nM ∼ RD ,

(6)

where R is the characteristic length of the aftershock
zone. Using (4) and (6), we obtain the scaling of the
number of aftershocks with the mainshock magnitude

given by (3) for small earthquakes, otherwise the seis-
micity at all scales would be controlled by inﬁnitely
small earthquakes.

5

nM ∼ 100.5DM

(7)

which gives α = 0.5D. Our estimation α = 0.8 for
Southern California seismicity thus suggests D = 1.6.
This value of the fractal dimension of aftershocks
hypocenters has never been measured for Southern
California seismicity. Our estimate of D is signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than the value measured in the range
[2-2.8] for aftershock sequences in Japan [Guo and
Ogata, 1997]. This fractal dimension of the spatial
distribution of aftershocks results in part from the
fractal structure of the fault system [Bonnet et al.,
2001], but it may also reﬂect the non-uniformity of
the distribution of the aftershocks on the fault due to
the heterogeneity of stress or strength on the fault.
The fractal dimension of the aftershock distribution
may thus be smaller than the fractal distribution of
the fault system.

Discussion and conclusion

While the energy release and the total slip on faults
is controlled by the largest earthquakes, the sugges-
tion that α < b implies that small earthquakes may
be more important than large earthquakes in trig-
gering aftershocks. We have also checked that the
magnitude distribution of aftershocks is independent
of the mainshock magnitude (Figure 2). This implies
that earthquake triggering is driven by the smallest
earthquakes at all scales, even for the largest earth-
quakes. Recent studies [Felzer et al., 2002; Helm-
stetter and Sornette, 2002] have proposed that sec-
ondary aftershocks dominate an aftershock sequence,
so that subsequent large aftershocks are more likely to
be triggered indirectly by a previous aftershock of the
mainshock. Our study further shows that the smallest
aftershocks will dominate the triggering of following
aftershocks. Therefore large aftershocks could not be
predicted, because they are likely to be triggered by
the smallest aftershocks below the detection thresh-
old of the seismic network. Small earthquakes taken
individually have a very low probability of trigger-
ing an earthquake. But because they are much more
numerous that larger earthquakes, collectively, they
trigger more aftershocks. This result requires the ex-
istence of a small magnitude cut-oﬀ m0, below which
earthquakes may occur but cannot trigger aftershocks
larger than m0, or a change of the scaling of N (M )

The best collapse in the time range 0.1-100 days is obtained for α = 0.81. The roll-oﬀ of the seismicity rate for
M ≥ 7 mainshocks at times smaller than 1 day is due to the incompleteness of the catalog after large mainshocks,
caused by the saturation of the seismic network.

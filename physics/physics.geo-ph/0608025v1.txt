Geo-neutrinos: A systematic approach
to uncertainties and correlations

Received: ..........

Abstract Geo-neutrinos emitted by heat-producing elements (U, Th and K)
represent a unique probe of the Earth interior. The characterization of their
ﬂuxes is subject, however, to rather large and highly correlated uncertainties.
The geochemical covariance of the U, Th and K abundances in various Earth
reservoirs induces positive correlations among the associated geo-neutrino
ﬂuxes, and between these and the radiogenic heat. Mass-balance constraints
in the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) tend instead to anti-correlate the radiogenic
element abundances in complementary reservoirs. Experimental geo-neutrino
observables may be further (anti)correlated by instrumental eﬀects. In this
context, we propose a systematic approach to covariance matrices, based on
the fact that all the relevant geo-neutrino observables and constraints can be
expressed as linear functions of the U, Th and K abundances in the Earth’s
reservoirs (with relatively well-known coeﬃcients). We brieﬂy discuss here
the construction of a tentative “geo-neutrino source model” (GNSM) for the
U, Th, and K abundances in the main Earth reservoirs, based on selected
geophysical and geochemical data and models (when available), on plausible
hypotheses (when possible), and admittedly on arbitrary assumptions (when
unavoidable). We use then the GNSM to make predictions about several ex-
periments (“forward approach”), and to show how future data can constrain
a posteriori the error matrix of the model itself (“backward approach”). The
method may provide a useful statistical framework for evaluating the impact
and the global consistency of prospective geo-neutrino measurements and
Earth models.

1 Introduction

Electron antineutrinos emitted in the decay chains of the heat-producing ele-
ments (HPE) U, Th, and K in terrestrial rocks — the so-called geo-neutrinos
— represent a truly unique probe of the Earth interior; see [1] for a recent
review and [2] for earlier discussions and references. The ﬁrst indications for
a (U+Th) geo-neutrino signal at > 2σ conﬁdence level in the KamLAND
experiment by [3] have boosted the interest in this ﬁeld, and have started
to bridge the two communities of particle physicists and Earth scientists —
as exemplarily testiﬁed by this Workshop (Neutrino Geophysics, Honolulu,
Hawaii, 2005).

The hope is that future measurement of geo-neutrino ﬂuxes can put sta-
tistically signiﬁcant constraints to the global abundances of HPE’s and to
their associated heat production rates, which are currently subject to highly
debated Earth model assumptions [4; 5]. This goal, despite being experi-
mentally very challenging, is extremely important and deserves dedicated
(possibly joint) studies from both scientiﬁc communities.

One methodological diﬃculty is represented by the diﬀerent “feeling”
for uncertainties by particle physicists vs Earth scientists. First important
attempts to systematize (U, Th, K) abundance uncertainties in a format
convenient for geo-neutrino analyses have been performed in [6] and partic-
ularly in [7; 8; 9], where errors have been basically assessed from the spread
in published estimates (consistently with mass balance constraints).

We propose to make a further step, by systematically taking into account
the ubiquitous error covariances, i.e., the fact that several quantities happen
to vary in the same direction (positive correlations) or in opposite direc-
tions (negative correlations) in the geo-neutrino context. For instance, in a
given Earth reservoir (say, the mantle), the U, Th and K abundances are
typically positively correlated. However, they may be anticorrelated in two
complementary reservoirs constrained by mass balance arguments, such as
the mantle and the crust in Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) models. Experimen-
tal geo-neutrino observables may be further (anti)correlated by instrumental
eﬀects.

An extensive discussion of our approach to these problems is beyond the
scope of this contribution and will be presented elsewhere [10]. Here we brieﬂy
report about some selected issues and results, according to the following
scheme. In Sec. 2 we discuss the general aspects and the statistical tools
related to covariance analyses, with emphasis on geo-neutrino observables. In
Sec. 3 we construct a tentative model for the source distribution of (U, Th, K)
in global Earth reservoirs (Geo Neutrino Source Model, GNSM). In Sec. 4 we
discuss some issues related to the characterization of local sources around geo-
neutrino detector sites. In Sec. 5 and 6 we show examples of “forward” error
estimates (i.e., propagation of GNSM errors to predicted geo-neutrino rates)
and shortly discuss “backward” error updates (i.e., GNSM error reduction
through prospective geo-neutrino data). We draw our conclusions in Sec. 7.

2 Covariance and correlations: General aspects

In this Section we discuss some general aspects of covariance analyses in geo-
chemistry and in neutrino physics, and then present the basic tools relevant
for geo-neutrino physics. We remind that, for any two quantities P and Q,
estimated as

P = P ± σP ,
Q = Q ± σQ ,

the correlation index ρP Q ∈ [−1, +1] between the 1-σ errors of P and Q
parameterizes the degree of “covariation” of the two quantities: ρ > 0 (< 0)
if they change in the same (opposite) direction, while ρ = 0 if they change
independently; see, e.g. [11]. The covariance (or squared error) matrix of
P and Q contains σ2
Q as diagonal elements, and ρP QσP σQ as oﬀ-
diagonal ones. For more than two variables with errors σi and correlations
σij , the covariance matrix is σ2
ij = ρijσiσj (symmetric, with ρii = 1 on the
diagonal).

P and σ2

2.1 Covariance analyses in geochemistry

In 1998, the Geochemical Earth Reference Model (GERM) initiative was
oﬃcially launched [12], in order to provide a “consensus model” for the ele-
mental abundances, together with their errors and correlations, in all relevant
Earth reservoirs. Although a lot of work has been done in this direction, e.g.,
through rich compilations of data and estimates (www.earthref.org), the cor-
relation matrices have not yet been estimated — not even for subsets of
elements such as (U, Th, K). To our knowledge, only a few regional studies
discuss HPE covariances. These diﬃculties can be in part overcome by us-
ing the (more frequently reported) elemental ratio information. For instance,
if the ratio of two abundances P and Q is reported together with its error
σP/Q, the correlation between P and Q can be inferred through the following
statistical relation, valid at ﬁrst order in error propagation:

Although the “ratio” and “correlation” information appear to be interchange-
able through the above formula, from a methodological viewpoint it is better
to use the latter rather than the ﬁrst, since the ratio of two Gaussian vari-
ables is a Cauchy distribution with formally inﬁnite variance [11] — a rather
tricky object in statistical manipulations.

2.2 Covariance analyses in neutrino physics

Neutrino physics has undergone a revolution in recent years, after the dis-
covery of neutrino ﬂavor oscillations. Phenomenological ﬁts to neutrino os-
cillation data have become increasingly reﬁned, and now routinely include

4

Fig. 1 Best-ﬁt U and Th event rates and error contours (solid lines) from our
analysis of KamLAND geo-neutrino data [10]. The contours are very close to
two-dimensional Gaussian conﬁdence levels (dashed ellipses). Units: 1 TNU = 1
event/year/1032 target protons.

covariance analyses (see, e.g., [13]). For our purposes, a relevant example is
also given by the Standard Solar Model [14], which provides, among other
things, errors and correlations for solar neutrino sources. We shall try to
apply a similar “format” to a geo-neutrino source model in Sec. 3.

Correlations arise not only at the level of neutrino sources, but also at
the detection level, as a consequence of instrumental eﬀects. For instance,
the KamLAND experiment is currently more sensitive to the sum (U+Th)
of geo-neutrino ﬂuxes rather than to the separate U and Th components. As
a consequence, the measured U and Th geo-neutrino event rates are anticor-
related: if one rate increases the other one tends to decrease, in order to keep
the total rate constant (within errors).

Figure 1 shows explicitly the anticorrelation between the U and Th exper-
imental rates through their 1, 2, and 3-σ contours (solid lines) taken from our
KamLAND data analysis [10]. The contours in Fig. 1 are well approximated
by a bivariate gaussian (dashed lines) with parameters:

RU = 12.5 ± 48.9 TNU, RTh = 34.7 ± 28.5 TNU, ρ = −0.645 .

(4)

We have also veriﬁed that our KamLAND data analysis reproduces the con-
ﬁdence level contours in the alternative plane spanned by RU + RTh and
(RU − RTh)/(RU + RTH) [3] (not shown); however, as explained in the pre-
vious subsection, we prefer to avoid any “ratio” and to use just (RU, RTh)
and their correlation.

2.3 General tools for geo-neutrinos

In the context of geo-neutrinos, statistical analyses are greatly simpliﬁed by
the fact that all relevant observables are linear combinations of the HPE

with coeﬃcient determined by known physics and by the geometry of the
Earth mass distribution.

In particular we consider: (i) the total radiogenic heat H of the Earth
(decay energy absorbed per unit of time); (ii) the geo-neutrino ﬂux ΦD at a
given detector site D (number of ν e per unit of area and time); and (iii) the
corresponding event rate RD at a given detector site D (number of events
from νe +p → n+e+, per unit of time and of target protons). Such quantities
can be written as:

where the universal coeﬃcients hS, φS, and rS, according to our calculations
[10], are given in Table 1. In the above equations, Mi is the mass of the i-th
reservoir, while hPeei ≃ 0.57 is the average survival oscillation probability of
geo-νe. The geometrical coeﬃcients f D
represent the mass-weighted average
i
of the inverse square distance of the detector site D from the i-th reservoir,
necessary to account for the ﬂux decrease with distance; their numerical
values will be reported elsewhere [10].

The Earth mass distribution necessary to compute the Mi’s and f D
i ’s is
taken from the Preliminary Earth Reference Model (PREM) [15], properly
matched with a crustal model deﬁned over a grid of 2◦ × 2◦ tiles [16]. The
Earth is assumed to be partitioned into the following homogeneous reservoirs:
core, lower mantle, upper mantle, continental crust (in three layers—upper,
middle, lower) and oceanic crust (lumped into one layer). The distinction (if
any) between lower and upper mantle is strongly debated and will be com-
mented later. For a set of possible geo-neutrino detector sites (Kamioka, Gran
Sasso, Sudbury, Hawaii, Pyh¨asalmi, Baksan), we consider “local” reservoirs,
deﬁned as the nine (three-by-three) tiles of the 2◦ × 2◦ model which surround
each detector site—except for Kamioka, where 13 tiles are considered, corre-
sponding to the “Japanese arc and forearc” as deﬁned in the crustal model

6

[16]. Due to the inverse-squared-distance decrease of the neutrino ﬂux, it
turns out that local and global reservoirs can provide comparable contribu-
tions to the geo-neutrino event rates, at least for detectors sitting on the
continental crust.

The main task is then to build a model for the abundances aS

covariances. In other words, by switching to a single-index vector notation
for simplicity,

aS

(cid:9)

(where N is the number of reservoirs), an Earth model should provide, for
any entry in the HPE abundance vector a, both a central value ai and a
standard deviation ±σi,

together with the error correlation matrix ρ. The components of the covari-
ance matrix σ2 are then

Given any two quantities P and Q [as in Eqs. (5)–(7)] deﬁned as linear

combinations of the ai’s (with T = transpose),

ai = ai ± σi

[σ2]ij = ρijσiσj .

The above equations will be used below to compute correlations among ex-
perimental event rates, or between an experimental rate and the radiogenic
heat.

3 Towards a Geo-Neutrino Source Model (GNSM)

In this Section we brieﬂy discuss our methodology to provide entries for
Eqs. (9,10), i.e., a Geo-Neutrino Source Model for HPE abundances in the
Earth. We remind that, concerning the entries for Eq. (9) (errors only, no cor-
relations), our approach overlaps in part with earlier relevant work performed
in [1; 7; 9].

3.1 The Bulk Silicate Earth

Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) models [4] provide global constraints on elemental
abundances (especially in the primitive mantle), under a set of hypotheses.
In particular, BSE models include the plausible assumption that elements
which have both high condensation temperature (“refractory”) and that are
preferentially embedded in rocks rather in iron (“lithophile”) should be found
in the primitive mantle (i.e., in the undiﬀerentiated mantle+crust reservoir)
in the same ratio as in the parent, pristine meteoritic material. Among the
three main HPE’s (U, Th, K), the ﬁrst two are also refractory lithophile
elements (RLE), so the Th/U global ratio should be the same in BSE and
in the (supposedly) parent and most primitive meteoritic material (carbona-
ceous chondrites CI). Our summary [10] of the recent and detailed works on
absolute [17; 18] and relative [19; 20] U and Th abundances in CI meteorites
(with 1σ errors) is:

aTh
CI = 30.4(1 ± 0.10) × 10
aU
CI = 8.10(1 ± 0.10) × 10
CI /aU
aTh
= 3.75(1 ± 0.05) ,
CI
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

which implies a (Th,U) error correlation ρCI = 0.875 through Eq. (15).

The BSE/CI abundance ratio is expected to be the same for all RLE’s, if
indeed they did not volatilize during the Earth formation history. The bench-
mark is usually provided by a major RLE element such as Al, which, being
much more abundant than the trace elements Th and U, can be more ro-
bustly constrained, both by mass-balance arguments and by direct sampling.
Our summary [10] for the BSE/CI abundance ratio of Al from three detailed
BSE models [17; 21; 22] is

with (Th,U) error correlation ρBSE = 0.936.

The K element, being (moderately) volatile, needs a separate discussion.
In [23] it was argued that U is a good “global” proxy for K, since: (1) the K/U
abundance ratio was found to be nearly constant in 22 samples of Mid-Ocean
Ridge Basalt (MORB) from the Atlantic and Paciﬁc ocean ﬂoor (thought to
be representative of the whole mantle); (2) the MORB K/U ratio was found
to be (accidentally) similar to the K/U ratio estimate in the crust from an
older model [24]. The MORB K/U ratio (1.27 × 104) was then boldly gener-
alized to the whole Earth, with small estimated errors (1.6%) [23]. However,
it should be noticed there are no geochemical arguments to presume that
disparate elements such as U and K should have the same partition coef-
ﬁcients between melt (= crust) and residual mineral (= depleted mantle);

indeed, analogous alleged coincidences have later been disproved [25]. There-
fore, we think that the “canonical K/U=12,700” ratio, so often quoted in the
geochemical literature, should be critically revisited in future studies. Provi-
sionally, from a survey of recent literature about the abundances of K and
U (and of another possible K-proxy element, La [17]) in MORB databases,
continental crust samples and estimates, and BSE models, we are inclined
to [10]: (1) increase signiﬁcantly — although subjectively — the K/U uncer-
tainty; and (2) slightly lower the central value (as compared with [23]). More
precisely, we take

which, by proper error propagation, gives the absolute K abundance as

(22)

(23)

with (K,Th) and (K,U) correlations equal to 0.648 and 0.701, respectively.
Table 2 presents a summary of the BSE (U, Th, K) abundances, errors and
correlation matrix, together with similar information about the main BSE
sub-reservoirs (as discussed below).

Needless to say, all the above BSE estimates may be signiﬁcantly altered,
if possible indications for nonzero HPE abundances in the Earth core [26]
are corroborated by further studies. For the sake of simplicity, we do not
consider such possibility in this work.

3.2 The Continental Crust (CC)

Average elemental abundances in the continental crust (CC), and their ver-
tical distribution in the three main identiﬁable layers (upper, middle, lower
crust = UC, MC, LC), have been presented in a recent comprehensive review
[27], together with a wealth of data and with a critical survey of earlier lit-
erature on the subject. In particular, it is stressed in [27] that some previous
CC models are not consistent with known crustal heat production constraints
[28]. This fact shows that: (1) the spread of published values for elemental
abundances is not necessarily indicative of the real uncertainties, since some

9

estimates can be invalidated by new and independent data; (2) heat produc-
tion estimates in the CC provide a relevant constraint (linear in the U, Th,
K crustal abundances) which might help, together with geo-neutrino mea-
surements, to reduce the HPE abundance estimates in reference models. The
latter point will be further elaborated elsewhere [10].

We basically adopt the results in [27] for the UC, MC, LC abundances of
(U, Th, K) and their uncertainties, with the following diﬀerences: (1) since
no error estimates are given for the LC, we conservatively (but arbitrarily)
assume fractional 1σ errors of 40% in this layer; (2) our reference crustal
model [16] and the one in [27] provide mass ratios among layers (UC:MC:LC)
respectively equal to 0.359:0.330:0.311 and 0.317:0.296:0.387. This diﬀerence
is somewhat disappointing, since it induces weighted-average HPE abundance
shifts in the CC of order 10%, which are deﬁnitely nonnegligible. “Consensus
values” for the mass distribution in the three CC layers (upper, middle, lower)
would thus be desirable in the future. Provisionally, we assume that CC
elemental abundance errors cannot be smaller than the “mass distribution”
induced error (10%). We also assume, from a survey of the relevant literature,
a 9% fractional error for each of the K/U, Th/U, and K/Th ratios in the crust
— which in turn provide the (U, Th, K) correlations [10]. Given such inputs,
the CC abundances (central values, errors, and correlations) turn out to be
as shown in Table 2.

3.3 The Upper Mantle (UM)

We assume a homogeneous composition for the upper mantle (deﬁned as
the sum of transition zone + low-velocity zone + “lid” in the PREM model
[15]). Global and detailed analyses of all the available upper mantle samples
and constraints have been performed in two recent papers [29; 30] which,
unfortunately, do not really agree in their conclusions, despite being based in
part on the same petrological database (www.petdb.org). Concerning HPE’s,
we then take as central values the average of [29] and [30], but we attach the
most conservative error estimates of [29], which are large enough to cover
the spread between [29] and [30]. We assume a K/U ratio error in the upper
mantle of the same size as for the BSE (±15%), and a Th/U ratio error of
±13%, as suggested from the scatter of points in Fig. 2 of [29]. Given such
inputs, the UM abundances turn out to be [10] as shown in Table 2.

3.4 The Oceanic Crust (OC)

The oceanic crust is diﬃcult to sample and, not surprisingly, only a few
papers (to our knowledge) deal with its average trace-element composition
(see, e.g., [31; 32; 33]). We adopt the “intermediate” central values of [31],
which suggest a HPE enrichment of the oceanic crust by a factor 20–25 with
respect to the (parent) upper mantle. Since the enrichment is approximately
uniform for all three HPE’s, we think it reasonable to assume that the same
relative spread of abundances is transferred from the UM (parent mineral)
to the OC (melt). Therefore, in the absence of other information, we attach

10

to the (U, Th, K) abundances in the OC the same fractional errors and
correlations as for the UM, see Table 2.

3.5 The Lower mantle (LM)

The consistent derivation of LM abundances, errors and correlations is a
qualifying result of our work. The abundances in the lower mantle (LM)
are obtained by subtraction (LM=BSE-UM-CC-OC), namely, by the mass
balance constraint:

LM = (aS
aS

BSEMBSE − aS

UMMUM − aS

CCMCC − aS

OCMOC)/MLM ,

(24)

for S=U, Th, K. Since the three HPE abundances aS
LM are linear combi-
nations of BSE, UM, CC, and OC abundances, it is possible to apply the
formalism of Sec. 2.3 and to obtain their errors and correlations, whose nu-
merical values are listed in Table 2 (last three columns). It turns out that
the LM fractional uncertainties are comparable to those of the UM (∼ 30%),
and that the LM abundances are strongly correlated with the BSE ones but
moderately anticorrelated with the CC ones, due to the subtraction proce-
dure. The LM anticorrelation with the UM and OC is instead very small,
since the latter two reservoirs contain relatively small absolute amounts of
HPE’s, as compared to the CC and BSE.

Once the LM contents of HPE’s are obtained, the BSE information be-
comes redundant, and one can proceed with the information contained in the
12 entries for the (CC, OC, UM, LM) abundances, and the corresponding
12 × 12 correlation matrix, which are reported in Table 2. Notice that, within
the quoted uncertainties, the abundances in Table 2 are consistent with those
reported in [8].

3.6 What about Mantle Convection?

There is currently a strong debate about the nature and extent of mantle
convection, with scenarios ranging from two-layer models (with geochemically
decoupled UM and LM) to whole mantle convection (with completely mixed
UM and LM), and many intermediate possibilities and variants [4; 34]. Two
extreme possibilities are: (1) a geochemically homogeneous mantle (i.e., no
LM = aS
diﬀerence between UM and LM, aS
UM); and (1) a strict two-layer model
(i.e., a lower mantle conserving primitive mantle abundances, aS
BSE).
Our estimates in Table 2 are intermediate between such two cases, and
thus agree better with models predicting partial mantle mixing. The two ex-
treme cases are anyway recovered by stretching the uncertainties to roughly
±3σ. Fig. 2 shows the 1, 2, and 3σ error ellipses in the (LM,UM) and
(LM,BSE) Uranium abundance planes; within 3σ, both cases aU
UM
and aU
BSE (slanted lines) are allowed. Similar results are obtained for
Th and K (not shown). Therefore, our GNSM estimates are suﬃciently con-
servative to cover, within ±3σ, a wide spectrum of mantle mixing scenarios
(two-layer convection, partial UM-LM mixing, whole mantle convection).

4 Issues related to “local” reservoirs

In our work, local reservoirs have been arbitrarily deﬁned as the nine crustal
tiles around each detector (except for Kamioka), see Sec. 2.3. Here we discuss
some issues related to this or other choices for the “local” contribution to
geo-neutrino ﬂuxes.

4.1 What is a “local” reservoir?

It is necessary to deﬁne in some way “local” reservoirs, since the crust (and
perhaps the mantle) within a few hundred km from each detectors site may
well be diﬀerent from the average crust deﬁned in the previous section. This
fact has already been recognized in [6; 9], where “local” HPE abundances
for the Kamioka site have been estimated. The boundaries of the local crust
are matter of convention — but any convention is not without consequences,
however. In particular, in our approach, we observe that the correlation be-
tween “local” reservoirs and “global” ones (LM, UM, OC, CC) is expected
to vanish: the uncertainty of the U abundance near the Kamioka mine has
probably nothing to do with the errors of the whole CC and OC crust es-
timates. However, only dedicated studies, which should take into account
all locally homogenous geochemical micro-reservoirs and their correlation
lengths with farther geo-structures, can provide a physically motivated dis-
tinction between local and global reservoirs—a task much beyond the scope
of this work. For simplicity, we just assume that all local-to-global abundance
correlations are exactly zero.

12

4.2 Horizontal and vertical (U, Th, K) distribution uncertainties

Assuming that a “local” reservoir is deﬁned in some way, its volumetric dis-
tributions of HPE’s can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the estimated geo-ν ﬂuxes, due
to the inverse square distance dependence. In principle, one would like to
have such detailed information around each detector site, both horizontally
and vertically. In practice, however, one usually has mainly scattered “sur-
face” samples and only weak constraints about the vertical HPE distribution.
Although the HPE abundances are expected to decrease with depth, the de-
crease may be highly site-dependent and non-monotonic (see [35] as an exam-
ple for the Japanese crust). In some cases (e.g., Sudbury [36]) the horizontal
and vertical distributions of HPE’s are correlated by the fact that the crust
is locally “tilted” — a situation which may represent both a complication
and an opportunity.

In all cases, signiﬁcant progress in the characterization of the HPE vol-
umetric distribution in local reservoirs can be obtained only by dedicated
geophysical and geochemical studies, which should collect all the (currently
sparse and partly unpublished) relevant pieces of data, including representa-
tive rock samples, local crustal models, and heat ﬂow measurements. Some
interesting work in this direction has been done for the Kamioka site [6; 9],
showing that a O(10%) uncertainty in the local geo-neutrino ﬂux (at 1σ)
may perhaps be reachable. We think that 10% should be the “target error”
for the characterization of the local geo-neutrino ﬂux at each detector site.
Much larger errors would hide information coming from farther reservoirs,
and in particular from the mantle.

4.3 Provisional assumptions

In order to make provisional numerical estimates, we make the following
assumptions for local HPE abundances in the crust: (1) we assume the same
numerical values and errors as for the average upper, middle, and lower crust
estimates [27] discussed in Sec. 3.2, except for the Kamioka site where the
average upper crust abundances are taken from the thorough geochemical
study in [37]; (2) we assume that the correlations between local and global
abundances, as well between local crust layers, are zero; (3) we assume a
plausible (but arbitrary) hierarchy of correlations between HPE abundances
in each layer: ρ(U, Th) = 0.8, ρ(U, K) = 0.7, ρ(K, Th) = 0.6, implying that
Th is a good proxy for U and that K is a somewhat worse proxy for both U
and Th (as it generally happens in other reservoirs). Further comments about
such choices are given elsewhere [10]. As previously remarked, the admittedly
arbitrary assumptions characterizing local contributions to geo-ν ﬂuxes can
and should be improved by dedicated inter-disciplinary studies.

5 Forward propagation of uncertainties

We have described in Sec. 2 a possible path towards the deﬁnition of a GNSM,
i.e., of a set of HPE abundances, errors and correlations in a given partition

Kamioka (small ellipses with positive correlations), superposed to the same Kam-
LAND experimental constraints as in Fig. 1. In both cases, the 1, 2, and 3σ contours
are shown. Current experimental errors appear to be signiﬁcantly larger than the
“theoretical” GNSM ones.

of the Earth into global and local reservoirs. We now show examples of prop-
agation of such uncertainties, according to Eqs. (11)–(15).

5.1 Errors and correlations at a speciﬁc site (Kamioka)

Figure 3 shows our estimated geo-neutrino event rates from U and Th de-
cays at the Kamioka site (including neutrino oscillations with hPeei = 0.57),
superposed to the same experimental (gaussian) contours as in Fig. 1. The
numerical values for the GNSM predictions are:

RU = 24.9 ± 2.0 TNU, RTh = 6.7 ± 0.5 TNU, ρ = +0.902 .

(25)

The correlation between the theoretical rates is positive, since Th and U
are good proxies of one another in each reservoir. The total (U+Th) rate in
Kamioka is also positively correlated with the total (U+Th+K) radiogenic
heat H in the Earth. We estimate:

RU+Th = 31.6 ± 2.5 TNU, H = 21.1 ± 3.0 TW, ρ = +0.858 .

(26)

The strong correlation between RU+Th and H implies that a precise mea-
surement of the former would yield a robust constraint on the latter. Un-
fortunately, the experimental errors in Fig. 3 are still much larger than the
theoretical (GNSM) ones, implying that, at present, the ﬁrst KamLAND
data do not signiﬁcantly constrain plausible Earth models and the associated
radiogenic heat (see also [38]). Patient accumulation of statistics, signiﬁcant
reduction of background and systematics, and new independent experiments,
are required to test and constrain typical Earth model predictions.

5.2 Errors and correlations among diﬀerent sites

Table 3 shows our estimates for the total (U+Th) rates (central values and
±1σ error) at diﬀerent possible detector sites, together with their correlation
matrix. Correlations are always positive (when one rate increases, any other
is typically expected to do the same), but can either be strong (such as
between Gran Sasso and Pyh¨asalmi, both located in somewhat similar CC
settings), or relatively weak (such as between any “continental crustal site”
and the peculiar “oceanic site” at Hawaii, which sits on the mantle). Such
correlations should be taken into account in the future, when data from two
or more detectors will be compared with Earth models.

6 Backward update of the GNSM error matrix

As shown in Fig. 3, the ﬁrst KamLAND data do not yet constrain our ten-
tative GNSM. However, it is tempting to investigate the impact of future,
high-statistics and multi-detector geo-neutrino data on the model. In partic-
ular, one might try to estimate what are the HPE abundances which best
ﬁt both the starting GNSM and a set of prospective, hypothetical experi-
mental data (“backward” update of GNSM errors). It can be shown that the
covariance formalism allows to reduce this problem to matrix algebra [10].

Here we give just a relevant example of possible results, in an admittedly
optimistic future scenario where all 6 detectors in Table 3 are operative and
collect separately U and Th events for a total exposure of 20 kilo-ton year, at
exactly the predicted rate, with no background and no systematics. In such
scenario, the mantle and BSE uranium abundance errors would be reduced
as in Fig. 4, which should be compared with the previous estimates in Fig. 2.
It can be seen that, in principle, the depicted scenario might allow to reject
at ≫ 3σ the case aLM = aUM, i.e., of global mantle convection, which would
be a really relevant result in geophysics and geochemistry. Needless to say,
more realistic (and less optimistic) simulations of prospective data need to be
performed in order to check if similar goals can be experimentally reached.
In any case, our approach may provide a useful template for such numerical
studies.

7 Conclusions and prospects for further work

In this contribution to the Hawaii Workshop on Neutrino Geophysics (2005)
we have brieﬂy presented a systematic approach to the ubiquitous issue of
covariances in geo-neutrino analyses. Correlations among the abundances of
(U,Th,K) in each reservoir and among diﬀerent reservoirs, as well as co-
variances between any two linear combinations of such abundances (includ-
ing neutrino ﬂuxes, event rates, heat production rates) have been treated
in a statistically consistent way. A tentative Geo Neutrino Source Model
(GNSM)—embedding a full error matrix for the (U,Th,K) abundances in
relevant local and global reservoirs—has been built, based on published data
(when available) and on supplementary assumptions (when needed). The con-
struction of the GNSM highlights some crucial issues that should be solved
by dedicated studies, in order to get the most from future geo-neutrino data.
Applications of our approach have been given in terms of predictions for
future experiments (“forward” propagation of errors) and of GNSM error
reduction through prospective data (“backward” update of uncertainties).
Inter-disciplinary studies of more reﬁned geochemical and geophysical Earth
models, and of future possible observations of geo-neutrino signals, are needed
to quantify more realistically both the assumed uncertainties and the future
impact of geo-neutrino data in Earth sciences.

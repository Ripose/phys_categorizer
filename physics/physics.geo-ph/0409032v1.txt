BEYERLE ET AL.: GPS OCCULTATION USING ZERO DIFFERENCING

Radio occultation data recorded on 28–29 July 2004 by the “BlackJack”

GPS receiver aboard the GRACE-B satellite are analyzed. The high stabil-

ity of the receiver clock allows for the implementation of a zero diﬀerence

technique rendering the clock calibration process with concurrent observa-

tions of a reference GPS satellite unnecessary. Comparisons of refractivity

proﬁles obtained by zero diﬀerencing with results calculated with the stan-

dard single diﬀerence method yield good agreement with an average fractional

refractivity deviation below 1% and an one-sigma standard deviation of 2–

3% at altitudes below 35 km. Both data sets are consistent with co-located

ECMWF meteorological analyses.

1. Introduction

In recent years atmospheric sounding by space-based Global Positioning System (GPS)

radio occultation (RO) is considered a valuable data source for numerical weather predic-

tion and climate change studies [Kuo et al., 2000]. From 1995 to 1997 the proof-of-concept

GPS/MET mission performed a series of successful measurement campaigns [Rocken et al.,

1997]; since 2001 RO instruments are operating successfully aboard the SAC-C [Hajj et al.,

2004] and CHAMP [Reigber et al., 2004] satellites.

During an occultation event the space-borne RO receiver records dual-frequency signals

from a GPS satellite setting behind the Earth horizon. Signal amplitudes and carrier

phases at the two GPS L-band frequencies f1 = 1.57542 GHz (L1) and f2 = 1.2276 GHz

(L2) are tracked with a sampling frequency of typically 50 Hz. The ionosphere and

neutral atmosphere induce characteristic signal changes which in turn are related to the

ray bending angles α(p) as a function impact parameter p. From α(p) the atmospheric

refractivity proﬁle N(z) = (n(z)

1)

106 is derived, where n(z) denotes the real part

−

·

of the atmospheric refractive index at altitude z. Finally, dry temperature and humidity

proﬁles are extracted from N(z). For a historical account and detailed descriptions of the

radio occultation technique see e.g. Yunck et al. [2000]; Kursinski et al. [1997]; Hajj et al.

[2002].

Data analysis of GPS/MET observations necessitated a double diﬀerence method to

correct for clock errors of the GPS satellites and the receiver aboard GPS/MET. Before

May 2000 the dominating source of GPS clock error was Selective Availability (S/A), an

intentional degradation of broadcast ephemeris data and the signal transmitter clocks.

BEYERLE ET AL.: GPS OCCULTATION USING ZERO DIFFERENCING

Since deactivation of S/A on 2 May 2000 the GPS clock errors are reduced by orders of

magnitude [Zumberge and Gendt, 2001]. Without S/A GPS clocks are suﬃciently stable

to replace the double diﬀerence by the single diﬀerence technique thereby eliminating the

need for concurrent high-rate ground station observations [Wickert et al., 2004]. Analyses

of 436 CHAMP refractivity proﬁles observed on 19–21 April 2001 and processed using

both, double and single diﬀerencing, agreed to better than 0.5% with no discernible bias

below altitudes of 30 km [Wickert et al., 2002].

On 28–29 July 2004 the GPS RO receiver aboard the GRACE-B satellite [Dunn et al.,

2003; Tapley and Reigber , 2003; Tapley et al., 2004] was activated for a brief test measure-

ment. During 24 h from 6:03 UTC 28 July to 7:09 UTC 29 July 109 setting occultations

were observed. The GRACE-B receiver clock is signiﬁcantly more stable than the re-

ceiver clock aboard CHAMP allowing for a data analysis using zero diﬀerencing, i.e. the

calibration process using carrier phase observations from a reference GPS satellite is not

needed.

2. Methodology and Data Analysis

Our description of the single and zero diﬀerence method follows closely the detailed

discussion of the atmospheric RO sounding technique given by Hajj et al. [2002]. Up to a

constant oﬀset the carrier phase measurements φk (k = 1 for L1, k = 2 for L2) delivered

by the “BlackJack” occultation receiver in units of cycles are written in terms of distances

as Lk

≡

c
fk φk + const where c is the vacuum speed of light. Lk is the sum of the distance

between transmitter and receiver, an extra delay induced by the neutral atmosphere and

the ionosphere, transmitter and receiver clock errors and other measurement noise. The

k = c (ˆtL

by a perfect clock moving with the space craft, and coordinate time t, which is the clock

can be written as [Hajj

The bending angles are Abel-inverted into a refractivity proﬁle following the standard

procedure.

Precise orbits of GRACE-B and the GPS satellites are provided by GFZ’s precise orbit

facility with temporal resolutions of 30 s and 5 min, respectively [K¨onig et al., 2002].

The observed GRACE refractivity proﬁles are intercompared with meteorological anal-

ysis results provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts

(ECMWF). ECMWF pressure and temperature values are calculated by linear interpola-

tion between grid points (0.5◦

0.5◦ resolution). Linear interpolation in time is performed

×

between 6 h analyses ﬁelds. The comparison between RO observation and meteorological

analysis is performed on the 60 pressure levels provided by the ECMWF atmospheric

model ranging from the ground surface up to 0.1 hPa (about 60 km altitude). Vertical

spacing of the model grid points increases from about 200 m at 1 km altitude to about

700 m at 10 km altitude.

3. Discussion

Between 6:03 UTC on 28 July 2004 and 7:09 UTC on 29 July 2004 the GPS receiver

aboard GRACE-B was activated to test occultation measurement mode. During these

25 hours the receiver recorded 109 occultation events lasting longer than 40 s. 101 of

which could be successfully converted to atmospheric refractivity proﬁles with the zero

diﬀerence method. The remaining 8 observations suﬀer from early loss of signal causing

fractional refractivity errors with respect to corresponding ECMWF proﬁle exceeding 10%

above 10 km altitude. The corresponding yield for single diﬀerencing is 93 proﬁles.

As discussed in section 2 the time diﬀerence between the true receiver clock and a co-

moving perfect clock, ˆtL

¯tL, is available from Eqn. 2. The temporal evolution of the

−

−

clock error ∆(ˆtL

¯tL)/Ts, extracted from the ﬁrst GRACE-B occultation measurement

on 28 July 2004, 6:09 UTC at 55.35◦N, 22.28◦E, is plotted in Fig. 1, bottom panel.

Here, ∆(xn)

xn+1 −

≡

xn denotes the forward diﬀerence operator and the sampling rate

is 1/Ts = 50 Hz. There exists a mean clock drift of 30.8 ns/s, the one-sigma standard

deviation is 1.77 ns/s. The observed drift is consistent with clock solutions obtained from

GRACE-B precise orbit calculations [G. Michalak, personal communication]. We note,

however, that the clock noise plotted in Fig. 1 also depends on the reference link delay

LRL
c

(Eqn. 2). Thus, ionospheric noise contributions might map into ˆtL

¯tL as well.

−

The stability improvement of GRACE-B’s receiver clock over CHAMP’s clock is evident

from comparing top and bottom panels of Fig. 1. The former shows an occultation

event recorded by CHAMP on 2 January 2004 on 6:13 UTC at 78.8◦N, 15.5◦W. The

CHAMP clock exhibits discontinuities of about 10 ns/s about every 18 s; superimposed

are additional structures once every second leading to a one-sigma standard deviation of

5.75 ns/s.

The refractivity proﬁle calculated from the ﬁrst GRACE occultation is plotted in Fig. 2.

The left panel shows dry temperature proﬁles derived from the occulation data using zero

and single diﬀerencing (full and dashed line, respectively). The corresponding ECMWF

temperatures are marked by stars. The deviation between GRACE observation and

ECMWF below 8 km altitude is caused by increasing contributions from water vapor

X - 10

to the observed refractivity proﬁle. The fractional refractivity errors of the two RO pro-

ﬁles with respect to ECMWF are plotted in the right panel.

An overview of the complete data set is shown in Fig. 3. In the left panel the mean frac-

tional refractivity error between RO observation and the corresponding ECMWF analysis

is plotted. The RO data sets consist of 101 and 93 proﬁles calculated with the zero and

double diﬀerence method, respectively. The one-sigma standard deviations are marked as

thin lines. The number of extracted data values as a function of altitude is plotted in the

right panel. Good agreement on the order of 1% is observed at altitudes ranging from the

mid troposphere to the upper stratosphere. The negative bias below 5 km is a well-known

phenomenon described and studied in GPS/MET, SAC-C and CHAMP validation studies

[see e.g. Rocken et al., 1997; Ao et al., 2003; Hajj et al., 2004].

The decrease in retrieved refractivities in the lower troposphere corresponds to similar

behavior of CHAMP proﬁles as well. In a recent analysis of 156,180 CHAMP observations

recorded between May 2001 and July 2004 [G. Beyerle et al., An analysis of refractivity

biases detected in GPS radio occultation data: Results from simulation studies, aerological

soundings and CHAMP satellite observations, submitted manuscript] only 50% of the

refractivity proﬁles are found to reach an altitude of z50% = 1.39 km. The corresponding

values derived from the two GRACE data sets are z50% = 2.11 km and z50% = 1.99 km

for zero and single diﬀerencing, respectively.

Finally, the fractional refractivity deviations between the zero diﬀerence and single

diﬀerence data sets are plotted in Fig. 4. The mean bias and residual standard deviations

(thin lines) are directly related to ionospheric noise contributions on the signal path to

the reference GPS satellite.

4. Conclusion

First radio occultation events observed by the GRACE-B satellite are successfully ana-

lyzed using the zero diﬀerence technique. The derived refractivities are in good agreement

with the corresponding proﬁles obtained by single diﬀerencing. Furthermore, both data

sets are consistent with ECMWF meteorological analyses. On the basis of these results we

expect a signiﬁcant improvement in occultation data quality by zero diﬀerence processing

once the GRACE occultation experiment is activated in an operational mode. Apart from

a possible reduction in down-link data volume zero diﬀerencing avoids error contributions

originating from ionospheric disturbances on the reference link.

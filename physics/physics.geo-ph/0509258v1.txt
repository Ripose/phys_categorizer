MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

Abstract. We analyze the eﬀect of seismic activity on sealevel variations,

by computing the time-dependent vertical crustal movement and geoid change

due to coseismic deformations and postseismic relaxation eﬀects. Seismic ac-

tivity can aﬀect both the absolute sealevel, by changing the Earth gravity

ﬁeld and hence the geoid height, and the relative sealevel, i.e. the radial dis-

tance between seaﬂoor and geoid level. By using comprehensive seismic cat-

alogues we assess the net eﬀect of seismicity on tidal relative sealevel mea-

surements as well as on the global oceanic surfaces, and we obtain an esti-

mate of absolute sealevel variations of seismic origin.

We improved the computational methods adopted in previous analyses con-

sidering the issue of water volume conservation through the application of

the sealevel equation and enabling us to evaluate the eﬀect of an extremely

large number of earthquakes on large grids covering the whole oceanic sur-

faces. These new potentialities allow us to perform more detailed investiga-

tions discovering a quantitative explanation for the overall tendency of earth-

quakes to produce a positive global relative sealevel variation. Our results

conﬁrm the ﬁnding of a previous analysis that, on a global scale, most of the

signal is associated with few giant thrust events, and that RSL estimates ob-

tained using tide-gauge data can be sensibly aﬀected by the seismic driven

sealevel signal.

The recent measures of sealevel obtained by satellite altimetry show a wide

regional variation of sealevel trends over the oceanic surfaces, with the largest

deviations from the mean trend occurring in tectonically active regions. While

our estimates of average absolute sealevel variations turn out to be orders

of magnitude smaller than the satellite measured variations, we can still ar-

gue that mass redistribution associated with aseismic tectonic processes may

contribute to the observed regional variability of sealevel variations. A de-

tailed study of these tectonic contributions is important to acquire a com-

plete understanding of the global sealevel variations and will be subject of

future investigations.

MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

1. Introduction

Current estimates of relative sealevel variations on a secular time-scale based on tide-

gauge measurements indicate a uniform rise in the range 1.75 ± 0.55 mm/yr [Douglas

et al., 2001; White et al., 2005]. The uncertainty on this ﬁgure depends on the particular

subset of observations employed, on their scatter, and on the method used to correct the

data for vertical land movements due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) [Mitrovica and

Davis, 1995]. The main contributions to last decades sealevel rise come from thermal

expansion of oceans due to global warming and ocean mass change due to glaciers and ice

sheet melting.

Recent observations from satellite altimetry [Cazenave and Nerem, 2004] over the

decade 1993–2003 gave a larger rate (3.1 mm/yr after removing GIA eﬀects) and, by

allowing for measurements of sealevel on the whole oceanic surfaces, evidenced a strong

nonuniform geographical distribution of sealevel changes, with some regions exhibiting

rates about 10 times greater than the global mean and some other regions where the

trend was inverted and negative variations up to 15 mm/yr were detected.

Since seismic events alter the equilibrium state of the solid Earth and perturbate its

gravitational ﬁeld, they are also likely to produce sealevel variations. The perturbation

of the Earth’s gravity ﬁeld due to mass redistribution following a seismic event aﬀects

the geoid level and it is therefore responsible for a variation in the absolute sealevel.

The vertical deformation of the seaﬂoor, together with the geoid change, produce also

a relative sealevel change. Relative sealevel is directly measured at tide-gauge stations,

while absolute sealevel is measured by satellite altimetric missions.

In a previous work [Melini et al., 2004], we investigated the eﬀect of global seismic

activity on the observed relative sealevel variations, and found that great earthquakes

have an overall tendency to produce a sealevel rise, aﬀecting the measurements taken

at those tide-gauge sites commonly employed for sealevel rise monitoring. On a global

scale, most of the signal is associated with few giant thrust events that, depending on

the viscosity of the asthenosphere, can induce a sealevel signal of at least 0.1 mm/yr.

This result has been obtained adopting the seismic catalogue considered by Marzocchi

et al. [2002], which contains 778 shallow earthquakes (depth ≤ 70km) with magnitude

M ≥ 7, and includes events from the Pacheco and Sykes [1992] compilation and the CMT

catalogue [Dziewonski et al., 1981].

Estimates of sealevel rise coming from water volume increase due to ocean warming

give a rate of about 0.5 mm/yr while the rate due to mass increase from ice melting is

highly controversial and recent estimates range from less than 0.5 mm/yr to 1.5 mm/yr

[Levitus et al., 2000; Miller and Douglas, 2004]. Therefore, the average contribution

to RSL coming from seismic activity maybe comparable with estimates of individual

climatological factors and, in regions with strong seismotectonical activity, may represent

locally a major contribution to RSL.

In this work, we compute the seismic contribution to sealevel rise on the whole oceanic

surfaces with a self-consistent approach that takes into account ocean volume conservation.

We use as seismic datasets both the catalogue considered by Marzocchi et al. [2002] and

the CMT catalogue up to July 31, 2004. The seismic dataset by Marzocchi et al. [2002]

covers a longer time window, which is a crucial feature in assessing long-term eﬀects,

while the CMT catalogue has a shorter temporal coverage but it is characterized by a

lower magnitude threshold and provides more reliable estimates of focal parameters. We

ﬁnd that the global mean of sealevel trends induced by earthquakes is positive, but its

geographical distribution is higly variable, with a pattern that shows several analogies

with the satellite measurements [Nerem and Mitchum, 2002; Cazenave and Nerem, 2004].

We also quantiﬁed the eﬀect of CMT seismic activity on tide-gauge measurements as

we did in Melini et al. [2004] for the Marzocchi et al. [2002] catalogue. While the CMT

results qualitatively conﬁrm the ones obtained previously, their absolute value is much

smaller, most likely because of the absence of giant subduction events like Chile 1960 and

Alaska 1964 in the CMT catalogue.

On December 26, 2004, an exceptionally large event stroke the Indonesian region. Ac-

cording to current estimates, it is probably the second largest event ever registered. We

present here some preliminary result about its eﬀect on sealevel.

In order to gain better insight into the reasons for the global tendence of seismicity to

produce positive sealevel variations, we performed a detailed synthetic analysis, investi-

gating separately the contributions to vertical displacements and geoid variations. We also

computed separately the RSL ﬁeld induced by 1960 Chile and 1964 Alaska earthquakes

and found that these two earthquakes alone account for a large fraction of the seismically-

driven sealevel signal. Beyond this, we found that the reciprocal geometrical features of

the relative sealevel signal associated with these two events and the distributions of the

tide gauge stations is mostly responsible for the positive mean in the computed relative

sealevel trend.

2. Method

2.1. Postseismic deformation modeling

To compute the time-dependent deformation and gravity ﬁeld variations associated

with a seismic dislocation we adopted the model proposed by Piersanti et al. [1995],

a spherical model which assumes an incompressible, layered, self-gravitating Earth with

Maxwell linear viscoelastic rheology. The model was later reﬁned by Soldati et al. [1998] to

account for gravitational eﬀects and by Boschi et al. [2000] to include the contribution of

deep (upper mantle) earthquakes. We refer the reader to these works for details concerning

the numerical approach.

We employed a 4-layer stratiﬁcation which includes an 80 km elastic lithosphere, a

200 km thick low-viscosity asthenosphere with η = 1019 Pa s, appropriate for oceanic

asthenosphere [Cadek and Fleitout, 2003], a uniform mantle with η = 1021 Pa s and a

ﬂuid inviscid core. All the other mechanical parameters have been obtained by means of

a weighted volume average of the corresponding parameters of PREM model.

Of course, our results depend on the chosen viscosity values. The eﬀect of varying

asthenosphere and mantle viscosity on the evolution of geophysical observables in the

postseismic relaxation process has been extensively discussed in a series of works [Piersanti

et al., 1995, 1997; Soldati et al., 1998; Boschi et al., 2000; Nostro et al., 2001] to which we

refer the reader for more details. Roughly, we can say that viscosity values smaller than

those employed here would further enhance the postseismic contribution to deformation

and gravity ﬁelds, while the purely elastic coseismic response would remain unchanged.

With this model, we computed the time-dependent deformation and gravity ﬁeld vari-

ations due to each seismic event in our catalogues. The time-dependent relative sealevel

X - 8

MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

S(t) at a given observation site is then computed from the vertical displacement uz and

geoid variation G as S(t) = G(t) − uz(t).

The procedure to retrieve the numerical solution from our model involves a spherical

harmonic expansion of the physical observables. Since the convergence of the harmonic

series is very slow, it is needed to sum up to very high harmonic degrees (1000 ≤ l ≤ 8000,

depending on source parameters), which requires huge computational resources. Since we

had to evaluate the contribution of over 20,000 earthquakes, we implemented our codes on

a parallel distributed-memory computer based on 48 Intel Xeon CPUs, where the whole

simulation procedure required about 2 months of CPU time to run.

2.2. Conservation of water volume

The modeling approach described above allows us to estimate the sea level variation

from the local changes in geoid height and seaﬂoor vertical displacements. However,

when dealing with global modeling, we should consider the problem of conservation of

total water mass. The most general approach to the problem of ocean water conservation

is expressed by the “sea level equation” (SLE), which takes into account the contribution

of geoid changes and vertical seaﬂoor displacements over the whole ocean [Douglas et al.,

2001; Peltier , 1998]. Moreover, SLE includes the immission of freshwater from melting of

continental ice sheets (which are a major factor in postglacial sealevel variations) as well

as the variation of the ocean function.

In the present approach, the conservation of total water mass is a direct consequence of

our formulation, since we do not admit any water mass exchange; also, we don’t include the

eﬀect of global warming, so we can assume constant water density; from these assumptions

follows the conservation of total water volume. Consequently, instead of using the most

D R A F T

August 12, 2013, 3:42am

D R A F T

MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

X - 9

general form of SLE, we can use a simpliﬁed approach. Let ur(θ, φ, t) and G(θ, φ, t) be

the vertical seaﬂoor displacement and geoid change at coordinates (θ, φ) and time t. We

can express the total water volume conservation as:

(G(θ, φ, t) − ur(θ, φ, t)) r2

T dΩ = 0

ZΩ′

(1)

where rT is the Earth radius and the integration is carried out over the surface of the

oceans. Since we are dealing with very small sealevel variations, we can safely neglect the

variations of the ocean function and assume the integration domain Ω′ to be constant.

In our modeling approach the conservation of water volume is not automatically guar-

anteed, so we have to correct our computations to assure the validity of equation 1. To

this aim, if G0 is the geoid change associated with seismic activity, we can introduce a

correction G1 so that the total geoid variation G = G0 + G1 satisﬁes equation 1. Since we

are dealing with small sealevel variations, at ﬁrst order we can assume that this oﬀset is

constant over the oceanic surface, so that from equation 1 follows

G1(t) = − R

Ω′ (G0(θ, φ, t) − ur(θ, φ, t)) r2
Ω′ r2
R

T dΩ

T dΩ

(2)

and we can write the relative sealevel at a given observation site as S(t) = G0(t) − ur(t) +

G1(t).

The computation of the correction term in eq. 2 involves the numerical integration of

G0(θ, φ, t) and ur(θ, φ, t) over the oceanic surface. Since the deformation ﬁeld of earth-

quakes has very strong spatial variations in the near ﬁeld, to carry out the numerical

integration a dense sampling of the integrand function is required. The point dislocation

approximation that we used in our simulations represents a further potential error source

in the evaluation of the integral, because it produces large, unrealistic values of the ﬁelds

near the source. Beyond this, Since we are dealing with simulations involving over 20,000

seismic events, we found that, even adopting a massive parallel computing approach, in

order to keep the simulation time acceptable (of the order of one month of CPU time)

we cannot perform the integration of eq. 2 for the whole seismic dataset. We considered

instead a set of 8 extremely large earthquakes occurred in the Paciﬁc area, which account

for about 80% of the total seiemic moment release in the last century [Casarotti et al.,

2001]. Since most of the seismic sealevel variation signal is associated with the largest

events, we computed the cumulative G1(t) with these 8 events and used it to correct the

sealevel time histories computed with the rest of the seismic dataset.

To assess the eﬀect of point source approximation in the near-ﬁeld geoid changes, we

integrated eq. 2 both using the whole integration domain and excluding grid points located

within a cutoﬀ distance d from the seismic source.

In ﬁgure 1 we compare the time-

dependent G1(t) computed without cutoﬀ and with d = 50, 100, 200 km. From this ﬁgure

we can infer that the correction due to water volume conservation is strongly dependent

on the chosen cutoﬀ value, conﬁrming that near-ﬁeld eﬀects give large contributions to

G1. Since the application of an integration cutoﬀ strongly aﬀects the ﬁnal correction term

and can shadow the physical signal, we decided to use the correction without cutoﬀ to

avoid the introduction of any arbitrary (operator dependent) bias. We emphasize that

this correction is strongly dependent by the near-ﬁeld signal, where we get ureliable values

of dislocation and gravity ﬁelds because of the point source representation, and therefore

G1 will be undoubtly aﬀected by approximation errors which may be quite large.

2.3. Seismic datasets

To compute the sealevel changes due to cumulative global seismicity we adopted two

diﬀerent catalogues. The ﬁrst is the one considered by Marzocchi et al. [2002], and includes

778 shallow (depth ≤ 70 km) magnitude M ≥ 7 earthquakes worldwide distributed in the

period 1900 − 1999. This dataset was compiled including data from the Centroid Moment

Tensor (CMT) [Dziewonski et al., 1981] and Pacheco and Sykes [1992] catalogues; the

focal parameters of the events taken from the Pacheco and Sykes catalogue have been

estimated by using the moment tensor of the neighbor earthquakes reported by the CMT

catalogue occurred within a certain distance from the Pacheco and Sykes epicenter, as

explained by Marzocchi et al. [2002]. From now on, we will refer to this catalogue as

“PS”.

The second catalogue is the whole CMT catalogue, from January 1, 1976 up to July 31,

2004 that contains 21,708 events with magnitude M ≥ 4.7.

Basically, the PS catalogue covers a longer time window and includes the greatest

events of the last century while the CMT catalog contains much more earthquakes with

more reliable focal parameters, but it is characterized in average by much less energetic

events. As a consequence, we could roughly say that the CMT catalog gives more precise

information on the small scale features of the temporal evolution of RSL signal at each

site while the PS catalog give more realistic results about the absolute magnitude of the

seismic driven RSL signal.

3. Results

In our previous investigations [Melini et al., 2004], we computed sealevel variations of

seismic origin only at the sites of PSMSL tide-gauge stations, also because the solution

X - 12

MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

of the numerical model on a large number of points, such as a grid spanning the oceanic

surfaces, had too heavy computational requests. For this work, we developed a further

optimized version of the numerical code exploiting a massive parallelism, that enables us

to compute the relative sealevel variations on the whole oceanic surfaces and to use, at

the same time, a much larger number of seismic sources, such as the ones reported by the

CMT catalogue.

3.1. Global eﬀects

Figures 2 and 3 show the magnitude of relative sea level variations, in the whole oceanic

surface, computed at diﬀerent time steps, due to the net eﬀect of all the earthquakes

contained in the PS and CMT catalogues, respectively.

The results obtained with PS catalogue, shown in ﬁgure 2, have been corrected to

account for the conservation of total water volume as described in section 2.2. Since

the greatest earthquakes of the last century used to compute the geoid correction are

included only in the PS catalogue, we didn’t apply it to the results obtained with the

CMT catalogue.

Even from a quick look at ﬁgures 2 and 3 we can see that the net eﬀect of seismicity

is a global increase of sealevel and that the magnitude of the induced variations shows a

highly spatial variability reaching in some regions values of several centimeters. We see

also that nearly all the coastlines are located within zones of positive RSL variation, while

the larger areas of negative RSL variation are mostly placed far from the coasts. Since the

vast majority of PSMSL tide-gauge stations are located along the coastlines, we expect

that when we compute the eﬀect of seismically-driven RSL on the PSMSL station sites

D R A F T

MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

X - 13

we will ﬁnd a positive signal, as, in fact, we did in our previous analyses [Melini et al.,

2004].

By comparing ﬁgures 2 and 3 we can see also that the RSL eﬀect of earthquakes con-

tained in the CMT catalog, which lacks the giant thrust events of the last century, turns

out to be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the eﬀect of PS seismicity. In fact,

when we look at the temporal variation of sealevels in ﬁgure 2, the largest contribution to

sealevel variations almost on the whole oceanic surface comes in the interval (1960–1970),

where we register the occurrence of the 1960 Chile and 1964 Alaska earthquakes. This is

a conﬁrmation of what we obtained when looking at the seismic RSL eﬀects on the time-

histories of tide-gauge measurements [Melini et al., 2004], i.e. that earthquake–induced

sealevel variations are mainly due to the eﬀect of a few big earthquakes rather than the

superposition of many small contributions.

The recent launch of altimetric satellite missions allowed to obtain independent esti-

mates of sealevel variations. The TOPEX/Poseidon mission [Nerem, 1995, 1997] measured

absolute geocentric sealevels along a ground track uniformly covering the oceanic surfaces.

The acquired dataset covers the last decade (1993–2003) and indicates a mean sealevel

rise of 3.1 mm/yr after correcting for GIA [Cazenave and Nerem, 2004].

In the same time window, our results give a global mean of order 10−3 mm/yr for

relative sealevel while the rate for absolute (i.e. geoid) changes are an order of magnitude

smaller. The sealevel trends obtained by global measurements such the ones carried out by

TOPEX/Poseidon are, in fact, mainly due to thermal expansion of ocean water in response

to global warming. Though it is clear that the global seismic selalevel signal is by far too

small to be compared with the total detected signal nevertheless it represents only a facet

D R A F T

D R A F T

X - 14

MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

of the broader problem of global tectonic eﬀects on sealevel. In this respect, it is reasonable

to consider that the RSL signal associated with seismic events is higly correlated, and

probably much smaller, with that associated with the whole tectonic processes since they

share a common physical origin. Therefore, even if a direct comparison between seismic

driven sealevel variations and measured trends is not possible, we remark that the role

played by the whole tectonic processes could be important. Also the fact that in the

detected data the main deviations from the mean sealevel trend are located in tectonically

active regions, suggests that this topic deserves further investigations.

3.2. Eﬀects on PSMSL sites

In ﬁgure 4 we show the rate of earthquake-induced relative sealevel variations expected

at each of the 1016 PSMSL tide–gauge stations due to the cumulative eﬀect of the CMT

catalogue seismicity. The plotted values have been computed by least-squares interpola-

tion of the time-series S(t) over (1976-2003); red and blue circles indicate sealevel rises

and falls, respectively. In ﬁgure 5 we plot the separate contribution to RSL variations due

to near-ﬁeld sources (distance from the tide-gauge within 500 km) and far-ﬁeld sources

(distance is greater than 500 km).

Also from the results of ﬁgure 4 we obtain that the eﬀect of seismicity on the RSL vari-

ations measured by tide-gauge stations is a positive trend. According to our simulations,

the average rate

k Sk/N over all the 1016 PSMSL sites is 0.019 mm/yr for the CMT

P

catalogue (while for the PS catalogue we found 0.25 mm/yr). Major deviations from the

general trend are observed in the Mediterranean area and along the circumpaciﬁc ring

(North American west coast, Chile and Peru).

X - 15

When we look at the RSL ﬁelds of ﬁgures 2 and 3 we can see that the areas where we

obtain a negative variation are limited in extension, except for the large negative lobe oﬀ

the Paciﬁc coast of South America, that is associated with the 1960 Chile event. This

behavior suggests that the negative sealevel variations are generally associated with the

local eﬀect of relatively small events. Indeed, when we separate the contributions to RSL

measured by tide-gauges coming from “near” and “far” earthquakes (ﬁgure 5), we see that

most of the negative contributions comes from earthquakes located within 500 km from

the tide-gauge.

In ﬁgures 6 and 7 we turn our attention to the details of sealevel time-histories of the

same PSMSL tide-gauge stations which have been considered by Douglas [1997] for his

estimate of long-term sealevel rise. This set of 24 sites have been selected by Douglas

for the length of sealevel records, which exceeds 70 years, for their expected tectonical

stability and for their worldwide coverage. We have grouped these PSMSL sites regionally

as done by Douglas [1991, 1997].

When we look at the eﬀect of PS seismicity (ﬁgure 6) we can see that most of the

seismic RSL signal is due to the coseismic eﬀects of a few giant earthquakes, mainly the

1960 Chile and 1964 Alaska earthquake. The postseismic relaxation plays an important

but not primary role, except for the stations located near the epicenter of large events

(i.e. San Francisco, Quequen, Buenos Aires). However, in these cases the point source

approximation used in our analysis gives unreliable results and a more realistic compu-

tation, based on a ﬁnite size seismic source, is needed. On the other hand, in the RSL

time–histories obtained from CMT seismicity (ﬁgure 7) we see that the dominant eﬀect

comes from postseismic relaxation, because of the absence of giant earthquakes in the time

X - 16

MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

window covered by the catalogue. This ﬁgure allows us also to evaluate the impact of the

correction for water volume conservation on the total RSL signal; though not negligible,

we can see that its eﬀect becomes important only in those sites where modest values of

seismic RSL signal are registered.

In ﬁgure 8 we compared the RSL time–histories obtained using PS and CMT catalogues

in the period 1976-2000, where the two datasets overlap. The time–histories obtained

with the two seismic catalogues show a correspondence of the coseismic step-like signals

produced by large earthquakes. Since the CMT catalogue includes much more events,

because of its lower magnitude threshold, in some cases it may happen that a Mw < 7

event (i.e. not included in PS) located near a tide-gauge station gives a strong signal in

the CMT time-history which is not found in the PS catalogue. This is, for instance, the

case of Trieste tide-gauge, which is aﬀected by the Mw = 6.5 Friuli earthquake occurred

on May 6, 1976, which is not reported by the PS catalogue but gives a large, mostly

postseismic, contribution to the time-histories computed with the CMT.

3.3. Synthetic analysis

All the results presented above show a preferentially positive global trend for seismically

induced sealevel variations. In our previous investigations [Melini et al., 2004] we spec-

ulated that this behavior might be a consequence of the well-known tendency of seismic

energy release to reduce the oblateness of the Earth [Chao and Gross, 1987; Chao et al.,

1996; Alfonsi and Spada, 1998]; nevertheless, this aspect awaits for a better understanding.

To this aim, we performed some further analyses.

In ﬁgure 9 we plotted the time evolution of relative sealevel variation induced by a point

thrust fault with 20◦ dip angle, seismic moment M0 = 1021Nm at a depth of 20 km. The

D R A F T

August 12, 2013, 3:42am

D R A F T

MELINI AND PIERSANTI: GLOBAL SEISMICITY AND SEALEVEL

X - 17

RSL variation induced by the fault exhibits well separated lobes of positive and negative

variations, whose dimensions are slowly varying with time. Near the epicenter we ﬁnd an

inner zone of negative variation and an outer zone of positive variation that expands with

time.

Now we focus our attention on the 1960 Chile earthquake (ﬁgure 10) that we know to

give a major contribution to the total RSL signal (see also Melini et al. [2004]). If we

plot the diﬀerence G(t) − uz(t) on both the oceanic and solid surfaces, we can see that

the resulting ﬁeld exhibits a balanced distribution of areas with positive and negative

variations, similar to the one shown in ﬁgure 9. The orientation of the Chile fault and

the geometric properties of the coastlines are such that the coasts, where the majority of

PSMSL tide-gauge stations are located, are in the positive RSL lobes.

If we repeat this analysis for the Alaska 1964 (ﬁgure 11) earthquake we obtain a similar

pattern. Here, the region with negative variations covers part of the North American

eastern coast, but in the cumulative results (ﬁgures 2 and 3) these negative variations are

shadowed by the much larger positive signal induced by the Chile event in the same area.

Therefore we can see that, in assessing the preferentially positive RSL trend predicted

by our simulations, a major role is played by the reciprocal geometrical properties of the

3.4. Eﬀect of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake

On December 26, 2004 an Mw = 9.3 earthquake stroke the northwestern coast of the

Sumatra island. Current estimates suggest that this is the second greatest event ever reg-

istered. Even if it lies outside the time window of our analysis, we report some preliminary

computation about its impact on sealevel.

In ﬁgure 12, we show the expected relative sealevel variation following the principal

event. The relative sealevel variation remains appreciable over an extremely large area

and should give a strong signal on the PSMSL tide-gauge stations located in the region.

For this computation, we modeled the seismic source using a preliminary rupture model

(http://www.gps.caltech.edu/ jichen/Earthquake/2004/aceh/aceh.html), which assumes

a 450km by 180km rupture plane with 320 degrees strike and 11 degrees dip angles.

Incidentally, we note that for this single event we were able to overcome the point dis-

location approximation and to adopt a realistic, ﬁnite seismic source. As a consequence

we obtained a precise estimate of the geoid correction needed to account for water vol-

ume conservation and we ascertained that, as the source reﬁnement increases, the geoid

correction tends to decrease.

4. Conclusions

In this work we further analyzed the eﬀect of seismic activity on sealevel variations.

We improved our computational methods, enabling us to evaluate the eﬀect of a larger

catalogue of earthquakes (as the CMT) on large grids covering the whole oceanic surfaces

and to take into account the eﬀects associated with the conservation of the total water

volume.

Our results conﬁrm the ﬁnding of a previous analysis that, on a global scale, most of the

signal is associated with few giant thrust events. These events can induce a sealevel signal

on the PSMSL tide gauge stations distributed worldwide of about 0.25 mm/yr. This value

is reduced by more than an order of magnitude if the eﬀects of the giant thrust earthquakes

of the last century are not considered (i.e. adopting CMT catalog). Since sealevel rise

rates associated with climatological factors (water volume increase due to ocean warming

and mass increase from ice melting) are estimated to be at most 1 ÷ 1.5 mm/yr [Levitus

et al., 2000; Miller and Douglas, 2004], the average contribution to RSL coming from

seismic activity is not negligible with respect to the climatological factors. Moreover,

in regions with strong seismotectonical activity, the seismic contribution amounts up to

several mm/yr representing a major contribution to RSL.

In our previous analysis we found that seismicity has an overall tendency to produce

a positive RSL variation, but the reason of this behavior was left unexplained. Now, we

mostly answered to that question: we found that the RSL ﬁeld induced by earthquakes

has alternating patterns of positive and negative trends, but the geometry of coastlines,

where tidal measurements are taken, is such that the majority of tide-gauge stations are

located in zones with positive seismic RSL trends.

A question to be faced in future developments will be the role played by tectonical

aseismic processes. While our analysis is far from deﬁnitely assessing the role of seismic

processes in RSL changes, it suggests that the whole tectonic process could be a major non-

climatic source of geoid perturbations and RSL variations; controversial evidence come

from the results of TOPEX/Poseidon mission that show large deviations from the mean

sealevel trend in regions with important tectonic activity. Altough recent investigations

have interpreted that satellite-derived sea level trend maps purely in term of thermal

expansion [Willis et al., 2004], we think that to obtain a complete understanding of sealevel

variations, the seismotectonical contributions can no longer be neglected.

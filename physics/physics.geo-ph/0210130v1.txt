Abstract: The observation of foreshocks preceding large earthquakes and the sugges-
tion that foreshocks have speciﬁc properties that may be used to distinguish them from
other earthquakes have raised the hope that large earthquakes may be predictable. Among
proposed anomalous properties are the larger proportion than normal of large versus small
foreshocks, the power law acceleration of seismicity rate as a function of time to the main-
shock and their spatial migration toward the mainshock, when averaging over many se-
quences. Using Southern California seismicity, we show that these properties and others
arise naturally from the simple model that any earthquake may trigger other earthquakes.
This model puts all earthquakes on the same footing. We ﬁnd that foreshocks precursory
properties are independent of the mainshock size. This implies that earthquakes (large or
small) are predictable to the same degree as seismicity rate is predictable from past seis-
micity by taking into account cascades of triggering.

1 Foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks: hypothesis and

predictions

It has been recognized for a long time that large earthquakes are sometimes preceded by an
acceleration of the seismic activity, known as foreshocks [1, 2]. In addition to the increase
of the seismicity rate a few hours to months before large earthquakes, other properties of
foreshocks have been reported, which suggest their usefulness (when present) as precursory
patterns for earthquake prediction. Because foreshocks are rare and it is believed that a
good proportion of them are forerunners of large events, speciﬁc physical mechanisms
have been proposed for them with the hope of helping earthquake prediction [3]-[6]. In
addition, anomalous precursory seismic activity extending years to decades before large
earthquakes and at distances up to ten times the mainshock rupture size are often thought to
require different physical mechanisms [7]-[12] than for foreshocks closer to the mainshock
epicenters.

The division between foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks has a long and distin-
guished history in seismology. Within a pre-speciﬁed space-time domain, foreshocks are
usually deﬁned as earthquakes (above the background rate) preceding a larger earthquake
(mainshock), which is itself followed by an increase in seismicity of smaller earthquakes
(aftershocks). However, recent empirical and theoretical scrutiny suggests that this divi-
sion might be arbitrary and physically artiﬁcial [13]-[17]. Since the underlying physical
processes are not fully understood, the qualifying time and space windows used to select
aftershocks, mainshocks and aftershocks are more based on common sense than on hard
science. If the space-time window is extended and a new event not considered previously
is found with a magnitude larger than the previously classiﬁed mainshock, it becomes the
new mainshock and all preceding events are retrospectively called foreshocks. A clear
identiﬁcation of foreshocks, aftershocks and mainshocks is hindered by the fact that noth-
ing distinguishes them in their seismic signatures: at the present level of resolution of
seismic inversions, they are found to have the same double-couple structure and the same
radiation patterns [14]. Statistically, the aftershock magnitudes are distributed according
to the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) distribution P (m) ∼ 10−bm with a similar b-value to other
earthquakes [18, 19]. However, some studies [19, 20, 21] have suggested that foreshocks
have a smaller b-value than other earthquakes, but the physical mechanisms are not yet
understood. Moreover, an event can be both an aftershock of a preceding large event, and
a mainshock of a following earthquake. For example, the M=6.5 Big Bear event is usually
considered as an aftershock of the M=7.3 Landers event, and has clearly triggered its own
aftershock sequence.

The Omori law describes the power law decay of the aftershock rate ∼ 1/(t − tc)p with
time from a mainshock that occurred at tc [22]-[24], and which may last from months up
to decades. In contrast with the well-deﬁned Omori law for aftershocks, there are huge
ﬂuctuations of the foreshock seismicity rate, if any, from one sequence of earthquakes to
another one preceding a mainshock, as shown in ﬁgure 1. By stacking many foreshock
sequences, a well-deﬁned acceleration of the seismicity preceding mainshocks emerges,

2

quantiﬁed by the so-called inverse Omori law ∼ 1/(tc − t)p′
, where tc is the time of the
mainshock [25, 23, 26]. The inverse Omori law is usually observed for time scales shorter
than the direct Omori law, of the order up to weeks to a few months before the mainshock.
However, there seems to be no way of identifying foreshocks from usual aftershocks and
mainshocks in real time (see [15, 14] for a pioneering presentation of this view point). In
other words, is the division between foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks falsiﬁable
[27]?

In order to address this question, we present a novel analysis of seismic catalogs, based
on a parsimonious model of the classiﬁcation of foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks,
in terms of earthquake triggering: earthquakes may trigger other earthquakes through a
variety of physical mechanisms [28] but this does not allow one to put a tag on them. Thus,
rather than keeping the speciﬁc classiﬁcation that foreshocks are precursors of mainshocks
and mainshocks trigger aftershocks, we start from the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1 Using the essential idea of triggered seismicity in time and space, a parsi-
monious description of seismicity does not require the division between foreshocks, main-
shocks and aftershocks that are indistinguishable from the point of view of their physical
processes.

The simplest construction that embodies the Hypothesis is the epidemic-type aftershock
(ETAS) model introduced in [16, 29] (in a slightly different form) and in [30], which is
described in the technical part 7. In this model, all earthquakes may be simultaneously
mainshocks, aftershocks and possibly foreshocks. An observed “aftershock” sequence in
the ETAS model is the sum of a cascade of events in which each event can trigger more
events. The triggering process may be caused by various mechanisms that either compete
or combine, such as pore-pressure changes due to pore-ﬂuid ﬂows coupled with stress
variations, slow redistribution of stress by aseismic creep, rate-and-state dependent friction
within faults, coupling between the viscoelastic lower crust and the brittle upper crust,
stress-assisted micro-crack corrosion, etc.. The ETAS model has been used previously
to give short-term probabilistic forecast of seismic activity [29, 31, 32], and to describe
the temporal and spatial clustering of seismic activity [30]-[33, 17]. The Hypothesis and
the ETAS model allow us to study two classes of foreshocks, called of type I (associated
with conditioned mainshocks) and of type II (associated with unconditioned mainshocks),
deﬁned in the technical part 6.

The simple embodiment of the Hypothesis in the ETAS model leads to the following
consequences and predictions [34], which are proposed as crucial tests of the Hypothesis.

1. The rate of foreshocks of type II is predicted to increase before the mainshock ac-
cording to the inverse Omori law N(t) ∼ 1/(tc − t)p′
with an exponent p′ smaller
than the exponent p of the direct Omori law. The exponent p′ depends on the “lo-
cal” Omori exponent 1 + θ describing the direct triggering rate between earthquakes
(ﬁrst-generation triggering), on the b-value of the GR distribution and on the expo-
nent α quantifying the increase ∝ 10αM in the number of aftershocks as a function
of the magnitude M of the mainshock [39]. The inverse Omori law also holds for
foreshocks of type I preceding large mainshocks.

3

2. In contrast with the direct Omori law, which is clearly observed after all large earth-
quakes, the inverse Omori law is a statistical law, which is observed only when stack-
ing many foreshock sequences. In this way, it may be possible to detect foreshocks
years and up to decades before the mainshock and at distance of up to two hundred
kilometers from the mainshock (see ﬁgures 3 and 4 below).

3. While the number of aftershocks increases as 10αM with the magnitude M of the
mainshock, the number of foreshocks of type II is predicted to be independent of M.
Thus, the seismicity should increase on average according to the inverse Omori law
before any earthquake, whatever its magnitude. For foreshocks of type I, the same
results should hold for large mainshocks. For small and intermediate values of the
mainshock magnitude M, the conditioning on foreshocks of type I to be smaller than
their mainshock makes their number increase with M solely due to the constraining
effect of their deﬁnition.

4. The GR distribution for foreshocks is predicted to change upon the approach of the
mainshock, by developing a bump in its tail. Speciﬁcally, the modiﬁcation of the GR
law is predicted to take the shape of an additive correction to the standard power law,
in which the new term is another power law with exponent b − α. The amplitude
of this additive power law term is predicted to also exhibit a power law acceleration
upon the approach to the mainshock.

5. The spatial distribution of foreshocks is predicted to migrate toward the mainshock
as the time increases toward the time of the mainshock, by the mechanism of a cas-
cade of seismic triggering leading to a succession of jumps like in a continuous-time
random walk [41].

We now proceed to test systematically these predictions on the catalog of the South-
ern California Data Center (SCEC) over the period 1932-2000, which is almost complete
above M = 3 and contains more than 22000 M ≥ 3 earthquakes, using the methodology
described in the technical part 6.

2 Direct and inverse Omori law

Figure 2 shows the rate of foreshocks of type II as a function of tc − t and of aftershocks
as a function of t − tc, where tc is the time of the mainshocks, with the space-time window
(T = 1 yr; R = 50 km). Both rates follow an approximate power law (inverse Omori
law for foreshocks with exponent p′ and Omori law for aftershocks with exponent p). The
ﬂuctuations of the data makes it hard to exclude the hypothesis that the two power laws
have the same exponent p = p′ ∼= 1., even if p′ seems slightly smaller. Note that it can be
shown theoretically for α < b/2 that p = 1 − θ and p′ = 1 − 2θ for a local Omori law
with exponent 1 + θ and that the difference p − p′ should get smaller as α increases above
b/2 [34]. Since α ∼= 0.8 > b/2 ≈ 0.5, this limit is met which explains the smallness of the
difference p − p′.

4

The second striking observation is the strong variation of the amplitude of the rate
Na(t) of aftershocks as a function of the magnitude M of the mainshock, which is well-
captured by an exponential dependence Na(t) ∝ 10αM /(t − tc)p with α ∼= 0.8 [39]. In
contrast, the rates of foreshocks of type II are completely independent of the magnitude
M of the mainshocks: quite strikingly, all mainshocks independently of their magnitudes
are preceded by the same statistical inverse Omori law, with the same power law increase
and the same absolute amplitude! All these results are very well modeled by the ETAS
model with the parameters α = 0.8, θ = 0.2 and b = 1 using the theoretical framework
and numerical simulations developed in Ref. [34].

Another remarkable observation is presented in ﬁgure 3 which shows the rate of fore-
shocks of type II for mainshock magnitudes between 4 and 4.5, for different values of the
distance R used to select aftershocks and foreshocks. The inverse Omori law is observed
up to R ≈ 200 km, and the duration of the foreshock sequences increases as R decreases
due to the decrease of the effect of the background seismicity. Restricting to the shortest
distances R to minimize the impact of background seismicity, the inverse Omori laws can
be observed up to 10 yrs before mainshocks, for foreshocks of type II (ﬁgure 4). Thus,
foreshocks are not immediate precursors of mainshocks but betray an organizing process
acting over very long time and large distances. However, this organizing process operates
entirely through the cascade of triggering embodied in the familiar Omori law.

An important question concerns the relative weight of coincidental shocks, i.e., early
aftershocks triggered by a previous large earthquake, which appear as foreshocks of type
II to subsequent aftershocks. Such coincidental shocks can give rise to an apparent in-
verse Omori law [13] when averaging over all possible positions of “mainshocks” in the
sequence, without any direct interaction between these mainshocks and preceding events
viewed as their foreshocks. Actually, these coincidental shocks form a minority of the total
set, because the fraction of shocks directly triggered by a mainshock decays to negligible
values beyond a few days for the range of parameters of the ETAS that realistically ﬁt the
SCEC catalog [17, 34].

Figure 5 shows the rate of foreshocks of type I as a function of tc − t and of after-
shocks as a function of t − tc, where tc is the time of the mainshocks. There are much
larger ﬂuctuations for foreshocks of type I than for foreshocks of type II due to the smaller
number of the former. Nevertheless, an increase of the seismicity before a mainshock for
foreshocks of type I is clearly visible, which implies that large mainshocks can be triggered
by smaller earthquakes. The exponent p′ of the inverse Omori law for foreshocks of type I
is approximately equal to the exponent of foreshocks of type II and to the exponent p of the
direct Omori law for aftershocks. The rate of foreshocks of type I increases slowly with
the mainshock magnitude but this increase is not due to a larger predictability of larger
earthquakes, as expected for example in the critical point theory [11] and as observed in a
numerical model of seismicity [38]. The increase of the number of type I foreshocks with
the mainshock magnitude can be reproduced faithfully in synthetic catalogs generated with
the ETAS model and is nothing but the consequence of the algorithmic rules used to deﬁne
foreshocks of type I: the smaller the mainshock magnitude, the more drastic is the selection
and the pruning of foreshocks [34]. In other words, there is no physics but only statistics

5

in the weak increase of foreshocks of type I with the mainshock magnitude. Conﬁrming
this concept, the inverse Omori law for foreshocks of type I becomes independent of the
mainshock magnitudes M for large M, for which the selection constraint has only a weak
statistical effect. The dependence of the inverse Omori law for foreshocks of type I as a
function of distance R used to select foreshocks is very similar (not shown) to that shown
for foreshocks of type II in ﬁgure 3, but the duration of foreshock sequences is shorter for
type I foreshocks.

3 Modiﬁcation of the magnitude distribution before a main-

shock

Let us state precisely the predictions of the ETAS model based only on the concept of
triggering between earthquakes. We refer to [34] for the derivation of the results stated be-
low, which is too involved to be reported here. Intuitively, the essence of the mathematical
derivation in Ref. [34] is that the inverse Omori law emerges as the expected (in a statistical
sense) trajectory of seismicity, conditioned on the fact that it leads to the burst of seismic
activity accompanying the mainshock (independently of its magnitude). This conditioned
seismic activity leads itself to a conditional Gutenberg-Richter distribution which is differ-
ent from the normal or unconditional Gutenberg-Richter distribution. Thus, conditioning
a seismic sequence to end at a mainshock, the distribution P (m) of foreshock magnitudes
is predicted to get an additive (or deviatoric) power law contribution q(t)dP (m) with an
exponent smaller than b and with an amplitude q(t) growing as a power law of the time to
the mainshock:

(1)
P (m) = (1 − q(t))P0(m) + q(t) dP (m) ,
where P0(m) is the standard GR distribution P0(m) ∼ 10−bm and dP (m) ∼ 10−b′m with
b′ = b − α. The amplitude q(t) of the deviatoric distribution in (1) should increase as a
power-law of the time to the mainshock according to
q(t) ∼ 1/(tc − t)θ b′
α .

(2)

This analytical prediction has been checked with extensive numerical simulations of the
ETAS model.
Intuitively, the additional deviatoric distribution dP (m) results from the
increase of the number of triggered events with the mainshock magnitude. The magnitude
distribution of triggering events is given by the product ρ(m)P0(m) ∼ 10αm10−bm ∼
dP (m), which gives the distribution of foreshock magnitudes for large m.

We now test this prediction using the SCEC catalog on foreshocks of type II of M > 3
mainshocks, selected using R = 20 km and T = 1 yr. The magnitude distribution P (m)
sampled at different times before mainshocks is shown in panel (a) of ﬁgure 6, where the
blue to red curves correspond to times preceding mainshocks decreasing from 1 year to
0.01 day with a logarithmic binning. As time approaches that of the mainshocks, one can
clearly observe that the tails depart more and more from the standard GR power law P0(m)
with b = 0.95 ± 0.1 estimated using the whole catalog and shown as the dashed line.

6

The deviatoric part q(t)dP (m) in (1) of the foreshock magnitude distribution, shown in
panel c) of ﬁgure 6, can be estimated by ﬁtting the prediction (1) to the observed magnitude
distribution of foreshocks, by inverting the parameters b′ and q(t) in (1) for different times
before mainshocks. The obtained deviatoric GR laws q(t)dP (m) are compatible with pure
power laws with an approximately constant exponent b′ = 0.6 ± 0.1 shown in panel (d) of
ﬁgure 6. The amplitude q(t) is shown in panel (b) and is compatible with a power law (2)
with a ﬁtted exponent 0.3 ± 0.2. These observations are in good qualitative agreement with
the predictions (1) and (2) on the nature of the modiﬁcation of the GR law for foreshocks
in terms of a pure deviatoric power law component with an amplitude growing as a power
law of the time to the mainshocks.

Note that expression (1) contains as a special case the model in which the modiﬁcation
of the GR law occurs solely by a progressive decrease of the b-value as the time of the
mainshock is approached (by putting q(t) = 1 and allowing b′ to adjust itself as a func-
tion of time), as proposed in [23, 40, 20, 21]. Our quantitative analysis clearly excludes
this possibility while being completely consistent with the mechanism embodied by the
concept of triggered seismicity that mainshocks are conditional aftershocks of foreshocks
[34]. Although the foreshock magnitude distribution is not a pure power-law but rather
the sum of two power laws, our results rationalize the reported decrease of b-value before
mainshocks [23, 40, 20, 21]. Indeed, with a limited number of events, the sum of two
power laws predicted by (1) with an increasing weight of the deviatoric part as the time of
the mainshock is approached will be seen as a decreasing b-value when ﬁtted with a single
GR power law.

4 Migration of foreshocks

The last prediction discussed here resulting from the Hypothesis is that foreshocks should
migrate slowly toward the mainshock. Note that the speciﬁcation (4) of the ETAS model
in the technical part 7 predicts no diffusion or migration if seismicity results solely from
direct triggering (ﬁrst generation from mother to daughter). Technically, this results from
the separability of the space and time dependence of φMi(t−ti, ~r −~ri). In the ETAS model,
diffusion and migration can be shown to result from the cascade of secondary, tertiary
(and so on) triggered seismicity, akin to a (continuous-time) random walk with multiple
steps [41], which couples the space and time dependence of the resulting global seismicity
rate. Assuming a cylindrical symmetry valid at large distances from the mainshocks, this
migration or anti-diffusion of the seismic activity toward the mainshock is quantiﬁed by
the characteristic size R of the cluster of foreshocks which is predicted to decrease before
the mainshock according to [34, 41]

R ∼ (tc − t)H ,

(3)

with H = θ/µ for µ < 2 where θ and µ are deﬁned in the technical insert 7. It is natural
that the (sub-)diffusive exponent H combines the exponent θ (respectively µ) of the time-
(resp. space-) dependent local processes (6) and (7). This law (3) describes the localization

7

of the seismicity as the mainshock approaches, which is also observed in real seismicity
[23, 42].

We use a superposed epoch analysis and stack all sequences of foreshocks of type II
synchronized at the time of the mainshock and with a common origin of space at the loca-
tion of each mainshock. The analysis of the California seismicity presented in inset of Fig-
ure 4 shows clearly a migration of the seismicity toward the mainshock, conﬁrmed by the
signiﬁcant diffusion exponent H = 0.3 ± 0.1. This value is compatible with the estimates
θ ∼= 0.2 and µ ∼= 1. However, this migration is likely to be an artifact of the background
activity, which dominates the catalog at long times and distances from the mainshocks. In-
deed, the shift in time from the dominance of the background activity at large times before
the mainshock to that of the foreshock activity clustered around the mainshock at times just
before it may be taken as an apparent inverse diffusion of the seismicity rate when using
standard quantiﬁers of diffusion processes (see [41] for a discussion of a similar effect for
the apparent diffusion of aftershocks).

5 Conclusions

By deﬁning the foreshocks of type II and by comparing them with standard foreshocks
of type I, we have followed Freeman Dyson who wrote that, “the effect of a concept-
driven revolution is to explain old things in new ways.” [43]. We have thus revisited the
phenomenology of earthquake foreshocks using the point of view of triggered seismicity
formulated in our Hypothesis. We have found that the most salient properties of foreshock
sequences are explained solely by the mechanism of earthquake triggering. This validates
the Hypothesis.

An important result is that the precursory modiﬁcation of the seismic activity before
a mainshock is independent of its magnitude, as expected by the triggering model with
a constant magnitude distribution. Therefore, large earthquakes are not better predictable
than smaller earthquakes on the basis of the power-law acceleration of the seismicity before
a mainshock or by using the modiﬁcation of the magnitude distribution. The increase of
the number of standard foreshocks of type I with the mainshock magnitude is found to
result solely from the sorting algorithm and does not reﬂect any deep physical mechanism.
All these results taken together stress the importance of the multiple cascades of earth-
quake triggering in order to make sense of the complex spatio-temporal seismicity.
In
particular, our results do not use any of the speciﬁc physical mechanisms proposed earlier
to account for some of the observations analyzed here. For instance, the ETAS model is
different from the receding stress shadow model [44, 11] and from the critical earthquake
model [9, 10, 11] which in addition each addresses only a speciﬁc part of the seismic
phenomenology. Our demonstration and/or conﬁrmations of (i) the increase of rate of
foreshocks before mainshocks (ii) at large distances and (iii) up to decades before main-
shocks, (iv) a change of the Gutenberg-Richter law from a concave to a convex shape for
foreshocks, and (v) the migration of foreshocks toward mainshocks are reminiscent of, if
not identical to, the precursory patterns documented in particular by the Russian [7, 12]

8

and Japanese [45] schools, whose physical origin has remained elusive an/or controversial.
The present work suggests that triggered seismicity is sufﬁcient to explain them.

6 First technical part: Deﬁnition of foreshocks of type I

and of type II

6.1 Formal deﬁnitions

The usual deﬁnition of foreshocks, that we shall call “foreshock of type I,” refers to any
event of magnitude smaller than or equal to the magnitude of the following event, then
identiﬁed as a “mainshock.” This deﬁnition implies the choice of a space-time window
R × T used to deﬁne both foreshocks and mainshocks. Mainshocks are large earthquakes
that were not preceded by a larger event in this space-time window. The same window
can be used to select foreshocks before mainshocks in a systematic search procedure. All
previous studies published in the literature dealt with foreshocks of type I.

In contrast, the Hypothesis makes it natural to deﬁne “foreshock of type II,” as any
earthquake preceding a large earthquake which is deﬁned as the mainshock, independently
of the relative magnitude of the foreshock compared to that of the mainshock. This sec-
ond deﬁnition will thus incorporate seismic sequences in which a foreshock could have
a magnitude larger than the mainshock, a situation which can alternatively be interpreted
as a mainshock followed by a large aftershock. The advantage of this second deﬁnition
is that foreshocks of type II are automatically deﬁned as soon as one has identiﬁed the
mainshocks, for instance, by calling mainshocks all events of magnitudes larger than some
threshold of interest. Foreshocks of type II are thus all events preceding these large mag-
nitude mainshocks. In contrast, foreshocks of type I need to obey a constraint on their
magnitude, which may be artiﬁcial, as we shall see further down.

6.2 Practical implementation

In our analysis of the SCEC catalog, we construct foreshock and aftershock sequences
as follows. A mainshock is deﬁned as an earthquake in the magnitude range (M, M +
∆M) that was not preceded by a larger event in a space-time window (R2, T ) before the
∼= 50 km is here chosen to be close to (but smaller than)
mainshock. The distance R2
the maximum size of the spatial clusters of seismicity in the California catalog, in order
to minimize the inﬂuence of large earthquakes that occurred before the mainshock. Other
choices between 20 km to 200 km have been tested and give essentially the same results.
The aftershocks are all events that occurred in a space-time window (R, T ) after each
mainshock. The foreshocks of type I are selected in a space-time window R, T before each
mainshock.

Since our purpose is to test the Hypothesis, which avoids the usual preconception on
foreshocks/mainshocks/aftershocks, we also consider foreshocks of type II deﬁned as the
events in a space-time window (R, T ) before each mainshock, now deﬁned without the
constraint that they were not preceded by a larger event in a space-time window (R2, T ).
The difference between foreshocks of type I and of type II is that the selection of their
respective mainshocks is different, the mainshocks of the former being rather arbitrary and
the corresponding foreshocks being very sensitive to the choice of the space-window (R2,

10

T ) used to select their mainshocks.

We use a superposed epoch analysis to stack all foreshocks and aftershocks sequences
synchronized at the time of the “mainshocks” in different mainshock magnitude intervals,
and for different choices of the space-time window R, T used to deﬁne foreshocks and
aftershocks. R has been tested between 10 km and up to 500 km with no essential change,
except for an increasing sensitivity to the background seismicity for the largest R (see ﬁg-
ure 3). T has been tested between 0.5 year to 10 years with similar results. Tests have also
been performed with the spatial window size R adjusted to scale with the mainshock mag-
nitude with no signiﬁcant difference. Our results presented below thus appear very robust
with respect to the (arbitrary) deﬁnitions of the space-time windows and the deﬁnition of
mainshocks. In the main text, foreshocks of type I and of type II are treated separately.
We use larger magnitude intervals ∆M for larger mainshock magnitudes to compensate
for the smaller earthquake populations. Previous studies of foreshocks using superposed
epoch analysis [35, 36, 1, 26, 23, 13, 37] have considered foreshocks of type I only.

7 Second technical part: Deﬁnitions of the ETAS model

The epidemic-type aftershock (ETAS) model assumes that a given event (the “mother”) of
magnitude mi occurring at time ti and position ~ri gives birth to other events (“daughters”)
of any possible magnitude m at a later time between t and t + dt and at point ~r ± ~dr at the
rate

φmi(t − ti, ~r − ~ri) = ρ(mi) Ψ(t − ti) Φ(~r − ~ri) .
We will refer to φmi(t−ti, ~r −~ri) as the “local”’ Omori law, giving the seismic rate induced
by a single mother. It is the product of three independent contributions:

(4)

1. ρ(mi) gives the number of daughters born from a mother with magnitude mi. This
term is in general chosen to account for the fact that large earthquakes have many
more triggered events than small earthquakes. Speciﬁcally,

which is justiﬁed by the power law dependence of the volume of stress perturbation
as a function of the earthquake rupture size.

2. Ψ(t − ti) is a normalized waiting time distribution giving the rate of daughters born

at time t − ti after the mother

(5)

(6)

3. Φ(~r − ~ri) is a normalized spatial “jump” distribution from the mother to each of
her daughter, quantifying the probability for a daughter to be triggered at a distance
|~r − ~ri| from the mother. Speciﬁcally, we take
µ
d + 1)1+µ

Φ(~r) =

d( |~r|

,

ρ(mi) = K 10αmi ,

Ψ(t) =

θ cθ
(t + c)1+θ .

which has the form of an (isotropic) elastic Green function dependence describing
the stress transfer in an elastic upper crust. The exponent µ is left adjustable to
account for heterogeneity and the possible complex modes of stress transfers [41].

The last ingredient of the ETAS model is that the magnitude m of each daughter is
chosen independently from that of the mother and of all other daughters according to the
Gutenberg-Richter distribution

P (m) = b ln(10) 10−b(m−m0) ,

(8)

with a b-value usually close to 1. m0 is a lower bound magnitude below which no daughter
is triggered.

time before mainshock (days)

Figure 1: Cumulative number of foreshocks of type II (see deﬁnition in technical part
6) for all M ≥ 6.5 mainshocks (thin color lines), and average number of foreshocks per
mainshock (heavy black line), obtained by stacking all (3700) foreshock sequences of M ≥
4 mainshocks in the SCEC catalog. The foreshocks have been selected in a time-space
window with T = 200 days and R = 30 km. While we see clearly an acceleration (inverse
Omori law ∼ 1/(tc − t)p′
, where tc is the common stacked mainshock time and p′ =
0.9±0.1) for the averaged foreshock number (black line), there are huge ﬂuctuations of the
rate of foreshocks for individual sequences. Most foreshock sequences are characterized
by the occurrence of a major earthquake before the mainshock, which has triggered the
mainshock most probably indirectly due to a cascade of multiple triggering. For instance,
66 days before its occurrence, the M = 7.3 Landers earthquake (upper curve) was preceded
by the M = 6.1 Joshua-Tree earthquake. The successive oscillations of the cumulative
number of events after the Joshua-Tree earthquake correspond to secondary, tertiary, etc.,
bursts of triggered seismicity.

Figure 2: Rate of seismic activity per mainshock for foreshocks of type II (continuous
lines) deﬁned in the technical part 6 and for aftershocks (dashed lines) measured as a
function of the time |t − tc| from the mainshock occurring at tc, obtained by stacking many
earthquake sequences for different mainshock magnitude intervals given in the inset panel.
The space-time window used to select foreshocks and aftershocks is (T = 1 yr; R = 50
km). The ﬂuctuations of the rate of foreshocks are larger for large mainshocks, because the
number of mainshocks (resp. foreshocks) decreases from 15584 (resp. 1656249) for the
magnitude range 3 − 3.5 down to 47 (resp. 1899) for M > 6 mainshocks. In contrast, the
ﬂuctuation of the rate of aftershocks are larger for small mainshocks magnitudes, due to the
increase of the number of aftershocks per mainshock with the mainshock magnitude, and
to the rules of mainshock selection which reject a large proportion of small earthquakes.
The number of mainshocks is different for aftershocks and foreshocks due to their distinct
deﬁnition. The number of mainshocks associated with aftershocks decreases from 677 for
the magnitude range 3−3.5 down to 39 for M ≥ 6 mainshocks. The number of aftershocks
increases from 2614 for 3 ≤ M < 3.5 up to 7797 for M ≥ 6 mainshocks. The truncation
of the seismicity rate for small times |tc − t| < 1 day, especially for aftershocks of large
M > 6 mainshocks and for foreshocks, is due to the incompleteness of the catalog at very
short times after mainshocks due to the saturation of the seismic network. At large times
from the mainshock, the seismicity rate decreases to the level of the background seismicity,
as seen clearly for the rate of aftershocks following small M = 3 mainshocks.

distance (km)

Figure 4: Rate of foreshocks of type II (deﬁned in the technical part 6) before M ≥ 4.5
mainshocks as a function of the distance from the mainshock for different values of the
time before the mainshock. We use logarithmic bins for the time windows, with a bin size
increasing from 0.01 day up to 10 yrs as a geometric series with multiplicative factor 3.2.
The number of events in each time window increases from N = 936 for 0.01 − 0.03 days
up to 2096633 for 1000 − 3650 days. We evaluate the seismicity rate for different dis-
tances from the mainshock by counting the number of events in each shell (r, r + ∆r). The
seismicity rate is normalized by the number of mainshocks, the duration of the time win-
dow and the widths of the space window ∆r (controlling the discretization of the curves)
used to estimate the seismicity rate. The inset shows the characteristic size of the cluster
of foreshocks, measured by the median of the distance between all foreshock-mainshock
pairs, as a function of the time before the mainshock. The solid line is a ﬁt by a power-law
R ∼ tH with H = 0.3. Due to the large space-time window T = 10 yrs and R = 500
km used to select foreshocks, a large proportion of the seismicity are background events,
which induces a spurious migration of seismicity toward the mainshock (see section 4).

Figure 5: Same as Figure 2 for foreshocks of type I (deﬁned in the technical part 6) which
have been selected using a space-time window R = R2 = 50 km and T = 1 yr. The pre-
sented data and the statistics for aftershocks are the same as in ﬁgure 2. The total number
of foreshocks of type I is much smaller that the number of type II foreshocks for small
mainshocks because a signiﬁcant fraction of foreshocks of type II are “aftershocks” of
large M > 6 earthquakes according to the usual deﬁnition and are therefore rejected from
the analysis of foreshocks of type I, which are constrained to be smaller than their main-
shock. The total number of foreshocks of type I ranges from 1050 to 5462 depending on
the mainshock magnitude. The same mainshocks are used for the selection of aftershocks
and of type I foreshocks.

Figure 6: (a) Magnitude distribution P (m) of foreshocks of type II using a space-time
window R = 20 km and T = 1 yr before each earthquake. Note the progressive transition
from a concave to a convex shape; (c) deviatoric distribution q(t)dP (m) measured for 10
time windows of equal number of events. The grey scale of each curve in (a) and (c)
ranges from blue to red as the time tc − t from the mainshock decreases from 1 yr to
0.01 day. The truncation for small magnitudes m < 4 is due to the incompleteness of the
catalog just after large earthquakes. The foreshock magnitude distribution is well ﬁtted in
the magnitude range 4 ≤ m ≤ 7 by the sum of two power-laws (1), with an exponent
b′ ≈ 0.6 independently of the time from the mainshock. The exponent b′ of dP (m) shown
in panel (d) is approximately constant for all time periods, except at very long times before
the mainshock where it drops to 0 when the amplitude q(t) of the deviatoric distribution
becomes too small. The amplitude q(t) of the deviatoric distribution is shown in panel (b)
with a power law ﬁt as a function of tc − t with exponent 0.3 ± 0.2 shown as the straight
line. Quantitatively, b′ is marginally outside the 2σ-conﬁdence interval for the prediction
b′ = b − α = 0.2 ± 0.2 using the estimation α = 0.8 ± 0.1 [39] that allows us to collapse
the aftershocks shown in ﬁgures 2 and 5 onto a single master curve (not shown here but see
Ref. [39]). We attribute this discrepancy to the dual impact of the incompleteness of the
catalog for small magnitudes after a large earthquake and to the smallness of the statistics.
We stress that the prediction (1) with b′ = b − α has been veriﬁed with good precision
in synthetic catalogs which do not have these limitations [34]. Using the best ﬁtted value
b′ = 0.6, we obtain a reasonable agreement for the predicted exponent θb′/α and the ﬁtted
value 0.3 ± 0.2 for the power law behavior of q(t) using θ in the range 0.2 − 0.4.

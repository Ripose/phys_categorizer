In a Letter earlier this year

[1] and in a number of
preceeding publications [2][3][4], the probability distribu-
tions for the “waiting time” between earthquake events
In particular it appears that the
have been discussed.
probability distribution for the number of events with
waiting time w, when expressed in terms of a suitably
scaled variable (w/w0) with w0 some characteristic time
constant, follows a universal function [4]. In this Com-
ment we would like to draw attention to the fact that
recently published data [5] of the CRESST collabora-
tion on microfractures in sapphire show the same fea-
tures. Indeed there is a great similarity, if not a remark-
able complete identity, of the probability distributions
expressed in this manner between the earthquakes and
the microfractures.

from an external radioactive source. These should follow
the Poissonian e−w/w0 and there is also a good ﬁt.

According to Corral ( Physica A) the form Eq 1 de-
scribes the waiting times for earthquakes, and with the
same power, α = 0.33. Concerning the time scale param-
eter w0, it is essentially the inverse of the observational
or experimental event rate R since from Eq 1

1/R = ¯w = (1 − α)w0 .

The data used in the Figure satisfy this relation to
within a few percent, as would be expected from the good
ﬁt. We ﬁnd that raising the energy threshold in a data
set, and so reducing R, leads to a linear relation between
the ﬁt w0 and R, as would be expected from Eq 2 with
a constant α.

Alternatively one could renounce ﬁtting w0, and sim-
−1
0 = (1 − α)R into Eq 1, use the exper-
ply substitute w
imental R (=28 000 events/28.5 hrs), and ﬁt for α. This
essentially one parameter ﬁt is satisfactory and yields
α = 0.26.

Although the CRESST values for α thus vary some-
what according to the analysis and from run to run,
the parallelism between the two kinds of phenomena is
striking. These considerations,
involving such widely
disparate time scales, energies, and material properties,
raise the question as to whether Eqs 1 and 2 do not rep-
resent a general law, applicable to many kinds of fracture
processes.

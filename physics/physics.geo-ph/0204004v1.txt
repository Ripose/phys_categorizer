An additional planet as a model for the Pleistocene Ice Age

W. W¨olﬂi∗, W. Baltensperger†, R. Nufer‡

February 2, 2008

Abstract

We propose a model for the Pleistocene Ice Age,
assuming the following scenario: Between 3 Myr
and 11.5 kyr BP a Mars-sized object existed which
moved in a highly eccentric orbit. Originating from
this object, gas clouds with a complex dynamics re-
duced Earth’s insolation and caused a drop in the
global temperature. In a close encounter, 11.5 kyr
ago, tidal forces deformed the Earth. While the
shape of the gyroscope Earth relaxed, the North Pole
moved geographically from Greenland to its present
position. During this close encounter, the object
was torn to pieces, each of which subsequently evap-
orated or plunged into the sun. These events termi-
nated the Ice Age Epoch.

1 Properties of the Pleisto-

cene Ice Age

Earth’s most recent Ice Age Epoch is characterised
by unique features, which still require an expla-
nation [1]. The Pleistocene Glaciation began ap-
proximately 2 Myr ago, after a gradual decrease
of the global temperature in the Upper Plicoene
from about 3 to 2 Myr BP. During the Pleisto-
cene the general drop in temperature was inter-
rupted by ﬂuctuations, which augmented in pro-
portion to the global cooling. Cold periods (Stadi-
als) and warm periods (Interstadials) followed each
other with a period of about 100 kyr during the
last 1 Myr. Sometimes the temperature of the In-
terstadials even exceeded the average value for the
Holocene [2] [Fig. 1]. The last Stadial (100 to 11.5

lar intervals by sudden temperature increases last-
ing from a few hundred to a few thousand years
(Dansgaard-Oeschger events) [3] [Fig. 2]. During
the Last Glacial Maximum, 20 kyr ago, the con-
tinental ice sheets reached the region around the
present New York and covered Northern Germany,
while Eastern Siberia and part of Alaska were ice-
free and inhabited by large herbivorous mammals
such as mammoths. Some of these have been ex-
cavated in a frozen state, which shows that in
these areas the temperature dropped suddenly at
the end of the Ice Age Epoch. During the Last
Glacial Maximum, the continental ice sheets were
centred in a geographically displaced position with

Northern Hemisphere this position was in Green-
land, about 18 degrees away from the present North
Pole [Fig. 3]. According to Fig. 2, the Last Glacial
Maximum was suddenly terminated 11.5 kyr ago.
At about the same time a catastrophic geological
event occurred, the relics of which are recorded in
peculiar sediments found all over the Earth [5].

2 An additional planet as the

basis of the model

Usually, the Ice Age Epoch is considered to be the
reaction of a highly unstable climate system to the
slow insolation variations proposed by Milankovitch
[6]. However, the present climate on Earth with
its distribution and behaviour follows the basis of
the Milankovitch model, suggesting that for the
Holocene the climate does not require major non-
linearities for its explanation. In contrast, through-
out the Ice Age Epoch, the climate was strongly
variable, as is evident from Fig. 1. It is therefore
reasonable to assume that for a limited time the
main driving force of the climate was not the Mi-
lankovitch eﬀect but an additional external agent to
which Earth’s climate responded linearly. In par-

Figure 1: Variation of the δ180 isotope abundance in benthic foraminifera in sea sediments from site 659
(18◦ N, 21◦ W) over the last 5.0 million years [2]. Decreasing δ18O corresponds to decreasing ice caps
and to warmer deep-sea temperature. The late Pliocene (before 3.2 Myr) is characterized by remarkably
stable and warm climatic conditions comparable to those of the Holocene, the average temperature of
which is shown by the horizontal dashed line.

ticular, the asymmetry of the ice distribution in
the Northern Hemisphere as well as the presence of
Mammoths in arctic Siberia during the Last Glacial
Maximum suggest that the geographic position of
the North Pole was located somewhere in Central
Greenland. If this was the case, then, at the End of
the Pleistocene, it had to move to its present posi-
tion. Such a movement of the geographic position
of the Earth’s rotation axis, which in stellar space
retains a practically ﬁxed direction, can be induced
by a transitory deformation of the Earth. This re-
quires an extremely close passage near the Earth of
a mass having at least the size of Mars. We there-
fore postulate that during the Ice Age Epoch and
in the Upper Pliocene such an additional planet ex-
isted, henceforth called Z. Since at present Z does
not exist any more, the Sun is the most likely agent
to have promoted its disappearance. We therefore
assume that Z moved in a highly eccentric orbit
with a perihelion distance of only about 4 million
km, so that during each passage near the Sun, Z
was heated by both tidal forces and solar radiation.
Thus planet Z was liquid and radiant.

from
into the planetary system from outside, i.e.
the Kuiper belt or the Oort cloud. Alternatively,
it may have its origin in the Asteroid belt or as a
moon of Jupiter. It then must have lost energy and
angular momentum through resonances with other
planets [7]. This requires a time of the order of a
million years only. Fig. 1 suggests that Z reached
an orbit with a small perihelion distance 3 million
years ago, thereby creating a gas cloud resulting in
the Earth’s Pleistocene. Regarding the termination
of Z, it is indispensable to assume that it was frag-
mented during the ﬁnal close encounter with the
Earth. This process consumed orbital energy, so
that the perihelion distances of the fragments were
likely to be reduced compared to the perihelion dis-
tance of Z. Most importantly, the smaller escape
velocity of the fragments increased the evaporation
rate. Typically, the molecular binding energy be-
came more important than the escape energy, so
that both molecules and clusters could evaporate.
These were then blown away by radiation pressure.
In this way, the fragments of Z could become dis-
solved within the Holocene. It is not unlikely that
some of the fragments also dropped into the Sun.

3 Origin and fate of Z

Since Z is not a member of the present planetary
system the crucial question has to be answered how
in such a short time interval it could appear and
subsequently disappear. Regarding the origin of Z
there are several possibilities: Z may have entered

calculation, the parameters assumed for Z at time
J2000.0 were: semi-major axis 0.978 AU, numeri-
cal eccentricity 0.973, inclination 0◦, longitude and
argument of the perihelion both 0◦. The result
for a period of 750 kyr is shown in Figs. 4 and
5. The orbit of Z was found to be stable over the
time range considered. The semi- major axis var-
ied within 0.95 AU and 1.1 AU without showing a
general trend. Similarly, the eccentricity remained
between 0.958 and 0.977. The inclination, i.e. the
angle between the orbit of Z and the invariant plane,
showed an irregular variation between 0◦ and 13.5◦,
with a period of approximately 9 kyr.
In Fig. 4,
each approach to Earth to less than 3 million km
is marked by a vertical line ending at the closest
distance. The Figure shows that the encounters
are irregularly clustered, somewhat resembling the
pattern of temperature ﬂuctuations of Figs. 1 and
2. In Fig. 5 calculated approaches between Z and
Earth to less than twice the Earth-Moon distance
are shown. Within 100 kyr there are several pas-
sages closer than Moon’s distance. These must have

created enormous earthquakes, and during the Ice
Age Epoch must have caused ruptures of the con-
tinental ice shelves. We tentatively identify these
with the Heinrich events [9]. The diagram in Fig. 5
contains no approach closer than 30 000 km, i.e.,
approaches which might induce a polar shift; how-
ever, additional calculations suggest that this may
occur once in a few Myr.

5 Mechanics of a polar shift

The asymmetry of the glaciation in the Northern
Hemisphere [Fig. 3] is the most conspicuous fea-
ture of the Ice Age Epoch. Because of this, a dis-
placed pole position and a fast polar migration have
been postulated already at the end of the 19th cen-
tury [10]. This migration is a damped precession
of the rotation axis on the globe, while the axis re-
mains ﬁxed in stellar space. This was discussed and
judged as impossible. Indeed, with an Earth in ei-
ther the solid or the liquid state, both of which were
at that time considered, a deformation would relax
too fast to allow an appreciable geographic shift of
the poles. However, assuming a plastic Earth with
a relaxation time of at least a few hundred days
makes possible a shift of the required magnitude of
ca. 18◦ [11]. The rotation of the unperturbed Earth
is stabilised by its increased radius at the equator
compared to that at the poles.
If the Earth had
an additional deformation in an oblique direction,
it would perform a motion in which the position of
the rotation axis on the globe would migrate. The
deformation could result from a close passage of a
planet-sized object, which would stretch the Earth
by tidal forces. A 1 per mil deformation is required
for the shift. We consider an initial stretching de-
formation of the Earth such that, at an angle of 30◦
with the initial rotation axis, the radius is increased
by 6.5 km.
In the ensuing process, the Earth re-
laxes into a new equilibrium shape with a displaced
equatorial belt. Angular momentum is strictly con-
served, and at all times the rotation axis practically
points to the same star. The spiral in Fig. 3 shows
the geographic path of the rotation axis. It is the
solution of Euler’s equations and a relaxation equa-
tion for the inertial tensor. A turn in the spiral
takes about 400 days. For details of the calcula-
tion, see Appendix and [12]. A stretching force is
obtained from the tidal action due to a mass near
the Earth. The required deformation corresponds
to the equilibrium shape of Earth when a Mars-sized
mass is at 24 000 km distance. The actual deforma-

CBPF-NF-007/02

7

tion problem, with a mass passing near the rotating
Earth, is vastly more complex. We expect that the
peak tidal force has to be about an order of magni-
tude larger; this brings the closest distance between
the centres of Earth and Z into the range of 12 000
to 15 000 km. As a result, Z enters the Roche limit
of Earth.
It is then likely to be torn into two or
more parts. Since Z is lighter than the Earth, tidal
eﬀects are stronger on Z than on Earth: Z is torn
to pieces rather than the Earth. Note that the re-
quirements restrict the mass of Z at the end of the
Pleistocene to a range of at least that of Mars and
clearly smaller than Earth’s. The polar shift event
must have been accompanied on Earth by conti-
nental ﬂoods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions,
i.e. a world-wide catastrophe, which actually left
many stratigraphic evidences and which can also
be assumed to be reported in traditions in many
countries all over the globe [5].

6 The gas cloud during the Ice

Age Epoch

Since during the Pleistocene Z is assumed to have
been at least Mars-sized, evaporation was limited by
the gravitational escape energy. Only single atoms
escaped from the hot surface of Z. If an atom has an
optical transition from the ground state within the
main solar spectrum, then radiation pressure ex-
pels it from the planetary system. However, some
atoms and many ions can be excited with ultravio-
let light only. Apart from the rare gas atoms, these

cases the repulsion due to solar radiation is much
weaker than the gravitational attraction to the Sun,
so that atoms of these elements can remain in bound
orbits. These orbits shrink due to the Poynting-
Robertson drag. The continued evaporation creates
an interplanetary cloud. Its material consists of sin-
gle atoms and ions and is thus quite distinct from
the present zodiacal dust [13]. The dynamics of
the atomic cloud involves a variety of processes and
is complex. We can only tentatively guess its be-
haviour. Collisions between atoms with planetary
velocities are inelastic. They reduce the relative ve-
locity between the colliding particles, so that their
outgoing orbits become more similar. This increases
the particle densities and thereby the frequency of
collisions. This suggests that the range of inclina-
tions of the orbits in the cloud can shrink with a
time scale determined by the mean free time for

particle collisions. Also, since collisions are inelas-
tic, the semi-axes diminish. Particles with diﬀer-
ent ratios of repulsion by solar radiation to gravita-
tional attraction intrinsically belong to diﬀerent or-
bits and may become separated. If molecules form,
these are expelled by radiation pressure. Atoms
and molecules may become ionised. The scatter-
ing of solar radiation from any material along the
line between Sun and Earth lowers the global tem-
perature. Clearly, this screening depends on the
density of the cloud and on the relative motions of
cloud and Earth. Therefore, the extremely strong
variations in temperature characteristic of the Plei-
stocene may be due to changes in the screening of
the Sun. The isotopic and stratigraphic data for
the last Myr of the Ice Age Epoch show a 100 kyr
period [14]. Now, Earth’s inclination, i.e. the an-
gle between Earth’s orbit and the invariant plane,
is governed by a 100 kyr cycle. The maxima of the
inclination in fact coincide with the Interstadials,
except for the last maximum, where no Interstadial
has been observed. This indicates that the orbits of
the atoms of the cloud often had inclinations which
were smaller than the maxima of Earth’s inclina-
tion. Possibly at the end of the Pleistocene the
width of the cloud had become too large. A similar
solution to the problem of the origin of the 100 kyr
cycle has previously been suggested by Muller et al
[15, 16].

7 The termination of the Ice

Age Epoch

The climatic ﬂuctuations which occurred towards
the end of the Pleistocene require further study.
We just note here that the last rapid increase of
the temperature recorded in the polar ice data oc-
curred at 11 500±65 yr BP [Fig. 2]. All radiocarbon
dates made on residue material originated during
the global catastrophe point to the same age [5, 17]).
However, these radiocarbon ages are not corrected
for the variation of the production rate. The new
dendro and U/Th calibration curves indicate that
these ages have to be increased by about 1500 yr
[18, 19]). Thus, it appears that the Younger Dryas,
which begins at 12 700±100 yr BP [3] is younger
than the polar shift event. At the beginning of the
Holocene the temperature increased in two steps.
The ﬁrst fast step was followed by a much slower
rise, which reached its maximum about 9 000 yr
ago [Fig. 2]. Since then the temperature remained

CBPF-NF-007/02

8

remarkably constant until today. The possibility
should not be a priori discarded that minor, still un-
explained climatic features such as the cold events
at 8.2 kyr cal BP [20] and 4.166 kyr cal BP [21] as
well as the so-called Little Ice Age, 300 years ago,
are due to remaining traces of gaseous material.

8 Facts which become plau-
sible or which can be ex-
plained by our model

8.1 From the displaced pole posi-

tions

• The asymmetry of the glaciation in North
America and east Siberia; it was the main moti-
vation for considering geographically displaced
poles. At present there are no climate models
which determine the optimum position of the
poles and the amount of screening of the solar
radiation compatible with the observed glacia-
tion.

• The existence of mammoths in arctic East
Siberia indicates that there was suﬃcient sun-
light for the growth of the plants on which they
lived.

• Archaeological objects having ages around
40 000 years BP were found close to the Arctic
Circle in Siberia [22]. At the time the place
had lower latitude.

8.2 From the
cloud

interplanetary gas

• The beginning of the general temperature de-
crease, 3 Myr ago can be understood as the
time at which the perihelion distance of Z be-
came suﬃciently small for the gas cloud to de-
velop.

• The coldest Ice Age was at the end of the
Pleistocene, since due to tidal work the perihe-
lion distance of Z decreased. With the passing
of time the cloud became denser.

• The colder the mean temperature,

the
larger were the variations of the tempera-
ture. Dense clouds throw strong shadows.

• Some Interstadials had higher temperatures
than at present. Not only was the Earth
exposed to the regular sunlight, but it also
received radiation scattered from clouds or
backscattered from material outside Earth’s or-
bit.

• The form of the Daansgard-Oeschger tem-
perature variations, typically a gradual de-
crease followed by a rapid increase, may be
connected with the presently still unknown dy-
namics of the cloud. The observed shape of the
variations may help to understand the cloud’s
behavior.

• During the last million years the Interstadials
occur approximately every 100 kyr, which co-
incides with the cycle of Earth’s inclination.

• Lake Baikal was never frozen during the Plei-

8.3 From the orbit of Z

stocene [23].

• The Tibetan Plateau was about 15◦ closer to
the equator and not ice-domed during the last
170 kyr [25].

• The Atacama Desert and the altiplano Bo-
livia were humid [24]. They were then situated
closer to the equator than today.

• The Sahara desert was covered with grass
and bushes during the Pleistocene. While for
the Western Sahara this may be explained by
its higher latitude in the Pleistocene, other rea-
sons such as globally lower temperature should
play a role in the Eastern Sahara.

• The approaches shown in Fig. 5 produce a sim-
ilar irregular pattern as the temperature vari-
ations of Fig. 2. The events marked in Fig. 5
have distances less than 3 Mio. km, which is
the radius to which a gas cloud may expand by
thermal motion during the passage from the
perihelion of Z to Earth’s distance. This sug-
gests that a screening of the solar radiation by
gases may lead to a frequency of tempera-
ture excursions as observed in the sequence
of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events.

• Gigantic earthquakes, as listed in Fig. 5, ac-
companied ﬂy-byes at less than Moon’s dis-
tance. Their frequency, about 6 per 100 kyr,
corresponds to the frequency of Heinrich

CBPF-NF-007/02

9

events,
in which large glaciers broke away
from the continent and ﬂoated into the Atlantic
Ocean.

• Fig. 5 contains no ﬂy-byes to less than 30 000
km, which might induce a polar shift. The rar-
ity of polar shifts, say one event in a few
Myr, is compatible with Fig. 5.

8.4 From the polar shift catastrophe
• The model explains how a polar shift within
the time of relaxation of a global deformation,
i.e. a few years, can occur.

• The frozen mammoths in the permafrost of
arctic Siberia are a direct consequence of the
geographic motion of the polar axis.

• The catastrophe produced a global extinction

of many species of large animals [5, 17].

• Frozen muck containing broken trees and
bones testify for the violence of the event [5].

• The fragmentation of Z lead to its relatively
rapid disappearance. Thus the Ice Age Epoch
had an end.

• Once the continental ice shelf was molten, the
Holocene was constantly warm and distinct
from the Interstadials, which were interrupted
by temperature variations.

• Human civilization reappeared about 9 000
years ago. Notably these populations, which
stem from survivors, had an elaborately struc-
tured language.

• Many traditions are related to Z or its frag-
ments, such as the Chinese dragon, a ﬂying ani-
mal that spits ﬁre and has a long, indeﬁnite tail
[26].

9 Conclusion

At present, the climate system of the Earth is ob-
served to react to external forcing in a plausible way.
If we assume this to be generally true in the geolog-
ical past the observed asymmetry of the glaciation
during the Late Glacial Maximum requires a shifted
pole position and a fast migration of the poles at the
end of the last glaciation. A pole shift of the order
of 18◦ requires a close encounter with a massive ob-
ject, which we have here called Z. Its mass was at

least Mars sized, but clearly smaller than Earth’s,
so that Z could be torn into fragments during the
encounter. Since only the Sun can dispose of Z, we
have to assume the perihelion of Z so small that Z
was intensely heated. Clearly, its aphelion has to
be larger than the radius of the Earth’s orbit. The
choice of the aphelion determines the frequency of
encounters. It had several million passes near the
sun and a few close encounters with the Earth as
well as with the other inner Planets. The heating
of the surface of Z lead to the accumulation of an
interplanetary atomic gas cloud having a complex
dynamics. The material between the Sun and the
Earth reduced the insolation and thereby the global
temperature in a time-dependent way. In particu-
lar, the increasingly cold and variable climate dur-
ing the last 3 Myr, until 11.5 kyr ago, is plausibly
explained by the slow decrease of the orbital energy
of Z and its angular momentum. The perihelion
decreases, and this enhances the density of the gas
cloud. In the Holocene, after the removal of all frag-
ments of Z, its threat for life on Earth ﬁnally ended.
Note that this model has only few free parameters.
On the other hand, it creates new problems that de-
serve a more complete treatment in future studies.
It may be worthwhile to clarify the relation of our
model to a claim held by I. Velikovsky [26] that a
close-by passage of Venus and later of Mars had pro-
duced a polar shift on Earth. Einstein [27] in his
third letter to Velikovsky resumed his recommen-
dations by the expression ”Catastrophes yes, Venus
no”. Our model is compatible with this directive of
Einstein.

agonal elements [1.0018, 0.9995, 1] and oﬀ-diagonal
elements Ξ12(0) = Ξ21(0) = 0.000 9. Deformations
are assumed to relax as

The geographic wandering of the rotation vector ~ω
in co-ordinates ﬁxed to the Earth is described by
the Euler equation for free motion:

d Ξ~ω
dt

= [Ξ~ω, ~ω].

A correlation between Earth’s inclinations and the times of the
cold events recorded in Devils Hole climate data

W. W¨olﬂi ∗ and W. Baltensperger†

The calculated values of Earth’s inclinations
during the cold events in the 500 kyr cli-
mate record of Devils Hole show a corre-
lation:
they cluster in the regions around
1 and 2 degrees. The Devils Hole record
has been chosen, since it was dated by ab-
solute methods. Other climate records co-
vering the same period also have a reduced
number of cold events between the two re-
gions. The correlation lends support to the
proposal of R. A. Muller and G.J. MacDo-
nald that the observed 100 kyr climate cycle
is due to the varying inclination of Earth’s
orbit and to material located near the in-
variant plane which shields oﬀ the solar ra-
diation.

The climate of the late Pleistocene (ca. 800 -
11.5 kyr BP) shows a 100 kyr glacial cycle. Muller
and McDonald [1] proposed that this feature is
caused by variations of the inclination, i.e. the tilt
of Earth’s orbital plane, rather than by eccentricity
variations, as assumed in the Milankovitch theory.
Their model implies that some gas or dust was lo-
cated near the invariant plane, which reduced the
solar radiation on Earth whenever the inclination
was smaller than the angle delimiting this cloud.

The present paper reports a correlation between
the values of Earth’s orbital inclination and the
times of the cold events using the climate record
of Devils Hole [3]. This record (Fig. 1) is chosen
because the ages of the calcite specimens were de-
termined by the U-Th method. The inclination of
the Earth, also displayed in Fig. 1, was calculated
by Quinn et al [4] and transformed into the invari-
able plane by Muller [2]. Fig. 2 shows that the in-
clinations at the times of the temperature minima
mostly lie within two regions, which are centred at
about 1 and 2 degrees, respectively. Fig. 2 indicates
that the correlation does not depend on the age of

the specimens. In most cases the inclinations have
relatively rapid time dependences at the points of
occurrence, so that these values are not favoured
by long exposures. Admittedly, in some cases the
selection of cold periods is arbitrary, however, with
slightly diﬀerent choices of temperature minima the
correlation still persists.

Similar plots have been made with climate
records, which were dated either by less reliable ab-
solute methods or tuned to the Milankovitch set of
parameters. In the Vostok [5] data a reduced oc-
currence of inclinations between 1.4 to 2.0 degrees
can be discerned. The records of Tiedemann et al.
[6] and Specmap [7] show the correlation during the
ﬁrst 0.6 Myr. The GRIP [8] record over 150 kyr is
more detailed, but too short in time for this kind
of analysis. The many Dansgaard-Oeschger events
are too fast to be explained by changes in Earth’s
inclination.

The correlation displayed in Fig. 2 indicates that
Earth’s inclination, which is not considered as a pa-
rameter of Milankovitch forcing, must be included
into the discussion of the Ice Age problem. The
gas is concentrated close to the surface of rotation-
ally symmetric cones, which form angles of 1 and
2 degrees with the invariant plane, respectively. A
distribution of dust, sharply peaked at angles of 2
and 10 degrees to the ecliptic, has been observed
with the satellite IRAS [9] . The authors suggest
that a cone could become a densely populated re-
gion of space, if there are orbiting particles, for
which an observed angle is an extreme value of their
time varying inclination. If during the Pleistocene a
cloud reduced the insolation on Earth, it must have
had a much higher density and a lifetime short com-
pared to 10 kyr. Candidates for the constituents of
such a cloud are atoms or ions, whose ﬁrst exci-
tation lies outside the main spectrum of the solar
radiation. The conical distribution may result from
their properties, in particular the ratio between the
force from the solar radiation and the gravitational
attraction. A possible source of the gas is described
in ref.[10].

The former tend to cluster near 1 and 2 degrees.
The vertical bars indicate the errors in the age,
which, near 400 kyr, increase from ±3 to ±20 kyr.
Thus the signiﬁcance of the oldest samples is small.
The solid line represents the inclination.

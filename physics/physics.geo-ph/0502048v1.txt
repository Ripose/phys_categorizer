In this paper we illustrate that simple statistical models can describe the quasi periodic occurrence
of earthquakes in a seismic fault. With this aim, we idealize the loading of elastic energy in a fault
with the stochastic ﬁlling of a box. The emptying of the box after its complete ﬁlling is analogous to
the generation of a large earthquake, in which the fault relaxes after having been loaded to its failure
threshold. The duration of that ﬁlling process is thus equivalent to the seismic cycle in the fault,
i.e. the period elapsed between two successive large earthquakes in that fault. The simplicity of this
model enables us to characterize the statistical distribution of the duration of its seismic cycle, its
mean, standard deviation and aperiodicity. In order to compare the results with actual data, we use
this distribution as a renewal model to ﬁt the series of characteristic earthquakes, with magnitude
around 6, which occurred at the Parkﬁeld segment of the San Andreas fault in California. After
assessing the quality of the ﬁt, we evaluate the annual probability of occurrence of a new earthquake
in the Parkﬁeld segment. Finally, a simple forecasting strategy is introduced, and its eﬀectiveness
is shown by means of an error diagram.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In reporting the mechanism of the great California
earthquake of 1906, and extending earlier insights into
the seismic process by Gilbert1,2, Reid3 presented his
elastic rebound theory.
It states that an earthquake is
the result of a sudden relaxation of elastic strain through
rupture along a fault (a rupture surface between two
rock blocks that move past each other). This theory has
since been the basic principle for interpreting the earth-
quakes that occur in faults in the Earth’s upper, fragile
part, sometimes called the schizosphere4. According to
Reid’s theory, the elastic energy slowly accumulates on a
fault over a long period of time after the occurrence of
an earthquake, as the rock blocks on both sides of the
fault are strained by tectonic forces. When the strain is
large enough, the system relaxes again by fast rupture
and/or frictional sliding along the fault during the next
earthquake. The elastic waves generated by this sudden
event are the seismic waves that seismometers measure
and that may produce catastrophic damage in human-
made constructions and human casualties, as a result.

The tectonic loading and relaxation process of a fault
is thus cyclic, being the seismic cycle the period of
time elapsed between two successive large earthquakes
that break the same fault (frequently called character-
istic earthquakes 5).
If the seismic cycle were periodic,
earthquake prediction would be an easy goal: The only
requisite needed for the prediction would be the time of
occurrence of two large consecutive earthquakes in the
same fault. There is increasing information about earth-
quake occurrence in the seismic record, compiled with
historical data and also by means of geological recogni-
tion of ancient large earthquakes on faults6. However,

these data show that the seismic cycle of any given fault
is not strictly periodic. The reason is that the tectonic
loading and relaxing of a fault are complex nonlinear
processes7. Moreover, faults occur in topologically com-
plex networks8 and an earthquake occurring in a fault
inﬂuences what occurs in other faults9,10.

Thus, the duration of the seismic cycle is not constant,
but follows a certain statistical distribution that could
be empirically deduced from the earthquake time series.
This distribution, if known, could be used for estimating
the probability of the next earthquake. However, it is
not well known, because there are few data (typically
less than ten) in the earthquake time series for any given
fault or fault segment. It is necessary, thus, in order to
follow that probabilistic approach, to use some kind of
theoretical statistical distribution to ﬁt the data.

In the nineteen-seventies11,12,13,14,15,16,17 it was pro-
posed a probabilistic model of earthquake recurrence that
considers earthquakes as a renewal process 18,19. This is
a kind of point process in which the times between suces-
sive events, in this case the large earthquakes in a fault,
are independent and identically distributed random vari-
ables. This is to say that the expected time of the next
event would not depend on any of the details of the last
event, except the time it occurred. Entwining with the
elastic rebound theory, the probability of another earth-
quake would be initially low just after a fault-rupturing
earthquake, and would then gradually increase, as tec-
tonic deformation slowly stresses the fault again. When
an earthquake ﬁnally occurs on the fault, it resets the
In a ﬁrst instance,
renewal process to its initial state.
several well-known statistical distributions (such as the
gamma,20 log-normal,21 and Weibull15,20,22,23) were used
to describe the duration of the seismic cycle and comput-

ing conditional probabilities of future earthquakes. These
distributions have been also used as failure models for
diﬀerent reliability and time-to-failure problems24.

More recently, a plethora of dynamical numerical mod-
els have been devised for simulating the tectonic pro-
cesses occurring on a seismic fault25,26. One advantage
of the models is that they can generate as many synthetic
earthquakes as desired, and thus overcome the problem
of having little data. Then, one possible application of
the models is to measure the statistical distribution of
the time intervals between large synthetic earthquakes,
and compare it with that of actual earthquake series. Up
to now, only two highly idealized numerical models of
a seismic fault, both with built-in loading and relaxing
mechanisms, have been used as renewal models for ﬁtting
actual time series and estimating earthquake probabili-
ties. These are the Brownian Passage Time Model27,28,
and the Minimalist Model29,30,31. The statistical distri-
butions derived from these models, as well as the gamma,
log-normal and Weibull, provide a reasonably good ﬁt to
the existing data (see Refs. 20,31,32 for details). The
renewal models have been widely applied, particularly in
Japan33,34,35 and in the United States36,37,38, to estimate
the probabilities of the next large earthquakes on speciﬁc
faults.

It is our aim in this paper to explain in a way as didac-
tic as possible how a renewal model can be tuned to ﬁt
the time series of earthquakes in a seismic fault, and how
a tuned model can be used for estimating the probability
of the next earthquake in the fault under consideration.
For this purpose we will use the process of stochastic
occupation of a box up to its complete ﬁlling, to visu-
alize the progressive loading of a seismic fault previous
to its relaxation. This box model (BM) will be used to
ﬁt the series of characteristic earthquakes, with magni-
tude around 6, which occurred at the Parkﬁeld segment
of the San Andreas fault in California, and to estimate
the annual probability of the next one.

In Section 2, we present the data of the Parkﬁeld series,
and compute its mean, standard deviation and aperiodic-
ity (coeﬃcient of variation). It is our belief that the pre-
sentation of the real data since the beginning is important
for a better appreciation of the design and tuning of the
subsequent model. Section 3 is devoted to a detailed pre-
sentation of the BM and some of its mathematical formu-
lae. In Section 4, the parameters of the BM will be tuned
to ﬁt the Parkﬁeld data series. Here we will emphasize
the diﬀerence between a “bare” non-dimensional model
and an appropriately dimensioned one. The comparison
between model and data is made in Section 5, and the
annual probability of occurrence of the next large shock
at Parkﬁeld is calculated and graphically represented. In
Section 6, we introduce a simple forecasting strategy for
the BM, applied to the Parkﬁeld sequence, and illustrate
its eﬀectiveness by means of the so-called error diagram.
Finally, in Section 7 we present our conclusions.

II. DATA OF THE PARKFIELD SERIES

The San Andreas fault runs for 1200 km, from the
Gulf of California (Mexico) to just north of San Fran-
cisco, where it dives into the Paciﬁc Ocean. Fortunately,
it does not slide or break in its whole length in a single
earthquake. Rather, as occurs in other long faults world-
wide, only one or few sections (segments) of its surface
do. During the last century and a half, several earth-
quakes of M ≃ 6 have broken a 35-km-long segment
of the San Andreas fault that crosses the small town
of Parkﬁeld, California. As they broke the whole seg-
ment, they are considered characteristic earthquakes of
that segment. Including the latest event, this Parkﬁeld
series39,40 consists of seven shocks at roughly periodic in-
tervals, which occurred on January 9, 1857; February 2,
1881; March 3, 1901; March 10, 1922; June 8, 1934; June
28, 1966 and September 28, 2004. As a consequence, the
time lengths, in years, of the observed six seismic cycles
are: x1 = 24.07, x2 = 20.08, x3 = 21.02, x4 = 12.25,
x5 = 32.05 and x6 = 38.25. Thus, the mean of the series

III. THE BOX MODEL

Cellular automata models are frequently used for
computer modeling of earthquakes and other natural
hazards41. These models evolve in discrete time units,
and consist of a grid of cells, where each cell can only be
in a ﬁnite number of states. Each cell’s state is updated
from one time step to the next according to certain rules.
These usually depend on the state of the cell or that of
its neighbors in the previous time step. For example,
the grid of cells can represent a discretized fault plane,
and the model rules can be designed according to cer-
tain friction laws26,42, stress transfer7,43,44, migration of
ﬂuids45,46, etc. In the most simple models29,47, these de-
tails are ignored: the model is driven stochastically, there
are only two possible states for each cell, and the earth-
quakes are generated according to extremely simpliﬁed
breaking rules. In this section we propose another model
It is simple enough to
of this last kind, even simpler.
be amenable to a detailed analytical description. At the
same time, it generates a temporal distribution of seismic
cycles that compares well with that of actual faults.

A. The rules

B. Some formulas of the box model

3

Consider an array with N sites. The spatial dimen-
sion of the array is irrelevant, but just to visualize it, we
can assume that the N sites are arranged in the shape
of a box (Fig. 1). At the beginning of a cycle, the box is
completely empty. At each time unit, one ball is thrown,
at random, to one of the positions in the box, i.e. each
site of the box has the same probability, 1/N , of receiv-
ing the new ball. If the site that receives the ball was
empty, after that throw the site will be occupied. If it
was already occupied, that ball is lost (thus, each site
can be either occupied by a ball or empty). When a new
throw completes the occupation of the N sites of the box,
it topples, becoming completely empty, and a new cycle
starts. The time elapsed since the beginning of a cycle,
expressed by the number of thrown balls, will be called
n. The duration of the cycles is statistically distributed
according to a discrete distribution function PN (n).

For the analytical description of the BM, it is conve-
nient to recall ﬁrst some elements of the so-called geomet-
ric distribution. Consider the probability that exactly
x independent Bernoulli trials, each with a probability
of success p, will be required until the ﬁrst success is
achieved. Thus the probability that (x − 1) failures will
be followed by a success is (1 − p)x−1p. The resulting
probability function,

f (x; p) = (1−p)x−1p,

x = 1, 2, 3, . . . ;

is known as the geometric distribution.

(5)

Now we proceed with the BM. As the ﬁlling of the box
proceeds sequentially, with the occupation of a ﬁrst site
followed by the second, etc. up to the N th site, and as
each of these sequential steps is as independent process,
the mean number of particles for the complete ﬁlling will
be

hniN = hx1i + hx2i + · · · + hxN i.

(6)

Now, due to the fact that the ﬁlling of site i is geo-
metrically distributed with pi = (N + 1 − i)/N , it follows
that

until all the cells of the box are full. Then the box is emptied
and a new cycle starts.

and therefore

The box represents the area of the fault or fault seg-
ment, and the occupation of a site by a ball stands for
the strain induced by the regional tectonics in a patch
or element of the fault plane. The total strain (or con-
versely the total potential elastic energy) accumulated in
the segment is represented by the number of occupied
sites. This number gradually grows up to the limit N ,
and the toppling of the box represents the occurrence
of the characteristic earthquake in the fault or fault seg-
ment. The loss of the balls that land on already occupied
sites mimics stress dissipation on the fault plane. The im-
plementation of the evolution of this system can be easily
done by a Monte Carlo simulation.

This model is similar to that introduced by Newman
and Turcotte in Ref. 47. The diﬀerence with the box
model is that their model is a square grid of cells in which
the topology is relevant: they consider that the char-
acteristic earthquake occurs when a percolating cluster
spans the grid. This obviously happens before the grid
is completely full.

and its accumulated function, AN (n), is

Therefore, in this limit of big N , the aperiodicity can be
estimated by using Eq. 11 with the asymptotic values
given by Eqs. 12 and 13.

The reader will likely have noted that in this section we
have apparently forgotten to quote the formula of PN (n).

and standard deviation, reads as follows

We have deduced Eq. 14 by means of a Markov chain
approach but because of its length we have preferred to
omit this derivation here.

IV. TUNING AND DIMENSIONING THE
PARAMETERS OF THE BOX MODEL

We will ﬁt the Parkﬁeld series with the accumulated
probability function of the BM (Eq.
15), using the
method of moments20. Another possible method that
could be used is that of the maximum likelihood20,48.
We have seen in Section 3 that the aperiodicity in the
BM depends only on N . Thus, we will use the box of
size N for which the aperiodicity is the closest to that
of the Parkﬁeld series, that is, α ≃ 0.3759. The result
is N = 11. For this N , from Eq. 11, the aperiodicity is
α = 0.3752.

On the other hand, from Eq. 8 the mean value of n for
N = 11 is hniN =11 = 33.22. As the actual mean of the
Parkﬁeld series is m = 24.62 yr, one non-dimensional step
of the model is equivalent to τ = 24.62 yr/33.22 = 0.74
yr ≃ 9 months. The discrete distribution function for
the duration of the seismic cycle in a box model with
N = 11, P11(n) is shown in Fig. 2.

4

In Fig. 3, we have plotted the time evolution of the
number of occupied sites for N = 11, for ten cycles. After
having ﬁxed the value of τ , in this drawing the actual
time unit is about ﬁve months. Note the ﬂuctuations in
the length of the cycles, which are consistent with the
mean and the standard deviation of the series.

Note also in Fig. 3 how the occupation increases
rapidly with time just after a toppling, and then this
increase slows down. This eﬀect is explained as follows.
As a cycle progresses, there are more occupied cells, and
it is less probable for the incoming balls to land on empty
sites. If ρn is the fraction of occupied cells at time step
n, there is a probability of 1 − ρn for the next ball to
be dropped on an empty cell. As this would induce an
increase of 1/N in ρ, the mean ρ at the step n + 1 is

hρn+1i = hρni +

[1 − hρni].

which approaches asymptotically to 1, explaining the be-
havior commented on before.

(cid:19)

The relaxation of a real fault by means of a large earth-
quake induces a reduction of stress in the system. Thus,
after that, a minimum time has to elapse before the fault
is stressed enough to produce the next large earthquake.
This eﬀect is called stress shadow9. In the BM there ex-
ists a stress shadow: a characteristic earthquake cannot
occur until the N th step in the cycle. According to the
BM, in the case of the Parkﬁeld series, this lapse is then
τ N ≃ 8 yr. In this way we conclude the dimensioning of
our model. In the next section, we will proceed to evalu-
ate the quality of the BM ﬁt for the Parkﬁeld series, and
to estimate the probability of the next earthquake in this
fault segment.

V. EARTHQUAKE PROBABILITIES AT
PARKFIELD

In Fig. 4a, we have superimposed the accumulated his-
togram (empirical distribution function) of the Parkﬁeld
series together with the accumulated distribution of the
BM, expressed in Eq. 15, for N = 11, and dimensioned
with τ = 0.74 yr. And in Fig. 4b, we show the residuals
of the ﬁt. Note that the discrepancies of the ﬁt expressed
by the residuals do not surpass 7.5%. The equivalent ﬁts
to these data, made by using the renewal models cited in
the Introduction, give very similar results32, with maxi-
mum residuals of 7%. As commented on before, during
the ﬁrst eight years after the last earthquake at Park-
ﬁeld (September 2004), the BM indicates that another
big shock should not be expected. From that moment
onwards, the cumulative probability of the next earth-
quake increases.

Now we proceed to calculate the yearly probability of
the next earthquake, that is, the conditional probability
of the next shock occurring in a certain year, given that
it has not occurred previously. For the BM, as a function
of n, it is

(18)

Note that 1/τ is the number of time steps of the BM that
correspond to one year. After calculating Pcond with Eq.
18, it is necessary to rescale the abscissas, n, to actual
years, nτ + t0, being t0 the calendar year at which the
last earthquake occurred (t0 = 2004.75 for the Parkﬁeld
series). In Fig. 5 we have plotted the yearly probability
for the new cycle at Parkﬁeld according to the BM. It
is interesting and instructive to observe the behavior of
this curve in the limit of a time much longer than the

In relation to this behavior of the yearly probability,
there exists in the seismological literature a famous ques-
tion posed by Davis, Jackson and Kagan49: “The longer
it has been since the last earthquake the longer the ex-
pected time till the next?”. Some years later, Sornette

In the case of the Parkﬁeld sequence, n∗ corresponds to

τ n∗ = 14.8 yr.

(23)

Thus, if the distribution derived from the box model cor-
rectly describes that of the Parkﬁeld series, the alarm
connected at this time since the beginning of the cycles,
and disconnected just after the occurrence of each shock,
would render the results written in Eq. 22. Note that
this time is smaller than the mean duration of the cycles,
m = 24.62 yr.

The quality of the model-earthquake forecast can be
also visually appreciated by means of an error diagram,
in which f e is plotted versus f a (Fig. 6b). This kind
of diagram was introduced in Geophysics literature by
Molchan51,52,53,54, and is similar to the so-called Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) diagram, used for exam-
ple, to test the success of weather forecasts55.

and Knopoﬀ50 called this “The Q question” and detailed
some statistical distributions that lead to aﬃrmative,
negative or neutral answers to it. After the result shown
in Fig. 5, we conclude that the BM produces a neutral
answer. The reason is that for a long cycle duration
(large n), the PN (n) of the BM has an exponential de-
cay, and therefore asymptotically the BM behaves as a
Poisson model, in which the conditional probability of
occurrence of the next earthquake is constant.

VI. A SIMPLE FORECASTING STRATEGY

In earthquake forecasting an approach is sometimes
used in which an “alarm” is turned on when it is esti-
mated that there is a high probability for the next earth-
quake to occur51. If the latter occurs when the alarm is
on, this is considered a success. If the earthquake takes
place when the alarm is oﬀ, this is a failure to predict.
Then, the fraction of errors, f e, is the number of failures
to predict divided by the total number of large earth-
quakes. The fraction of alarm time, f a, is the ratio of
the interval of time in which the alarm is on and the total
time of observation. Obviously a good strategy of fore-
casting must produce both small f e and f a. Depending
on the trade-oﬀ between costs and beneﬁts in the fore-
casting, we can try to minimize a loss function, L. For
sake of simplicity, we will consider a simple loss function
deﬁned as the sum of the fraction of alarm time plus the
fraction of failures to predict,

L = f a + f e.

(19)

As in the previous sections we have ﬁtted the Parkﬁeld
sequence by a statistical distribution, PN (n), obtained
from the box model, we can imagine a simple earthquake
forecasting strategy at Parkﬁeld and calculate the value
of L for it. The strategy consists in connecting the alarm
at a ﬁxed value of n time steps after the last big earth-
quake, and maintain the alarm on until the next one.
Then the alarm is turned oﬀ, and the same strategy is
repeated, evaluating f a and f e, for all the cycles. With
a small eﬀort, the reader will realize that

f e(n) =

These relations are graphically illustrated in Fig. 6a, to-
gether with L = f a + f e. For any N of the model, L(n)
has a minimum at a diﬀerent value of n, n∗(N ). As can
be seen in the ﬁgure, n∗(11) = 20, for which

In this article, we have tried to explain in a simple and
didactic way a number of concepts related to the statis-

VII. CONCLUSIONS

tics of the quasi periodic occurrence of earthquakes in a
fault. With this aim, we have introduced a toy renewal
model based on the stochastic occupation of a box with
N sites. The probability distribution obtained from this
process has been used to ﬁt the sequence of characteris-
tic earthquakes which occurred in Parkﬁeld (California).
This has determined the value of N , and also has es-
tablished the temporal value of the dimensionless steps
between successive ball throws to the box.

Once the model is tuned, we have compared it with the
data of the real sequence, and observed that the residuals
of the ﬁtting are actually small. Then, we have calculated
the annual probability of occurrence of the next earth-
quake. Finally, using the language of error diagrams,
and deﬁning a simple strategy of forecasting, we have
calculated the corresponding values of the error fraction,
the alarm fraction and the loss function.

In our opinion, the material presented here can be a
useful tool for a teacher, to introduce several important
geophysical and statistical concepts to an undergraduate
audience with diﬀerent backgrounds. Besides, it can il-
lustrate the way of making quantitative estimates of a
natural phenomenon as popular, and at the same time
as mystifying, as earthquakes.

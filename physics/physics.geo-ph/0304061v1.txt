SUMMARY

We report a survey carried out on basalt ﬂows from Amsterdam Island (Southeastern

Indian Ocean) in order to check the presence of intermediate directions interpreted to be-

long to a geomagnetic ﬁeld excursion within the Brunhes epoch (Watkins & Nougier, 1973),

completing this paleomagnetic record with paleointensity determinations and radiomet-

ric dating. Because the paleomagnetic sampling was done in few hours during the re-

supply of the French scientiﬁc base Martin du Viviers by the Marion Dufresne vessel,

we could collected only 29 samples from 4 lava ﬂows. The directional results corroborate

the ﬁndings by Watkins & Nougier (1973) : normal polarity is found for two units and

an intermediate direction, with associated Virtual Geomagnetic Poles (VGPs) close to

the equator, for the other two units. A notable result is that these volcanic rocks are

well suited for absolute paleointensity determinations. Fifty percent of the samples yields

reliable intensity values with high quality factors. An original element of this study is

that we made use of the thermomagnetic criterion PTRM-tail test of Shcherbakova et

2

Carvallo et al.

al. (2000) to help in the interpretation of the paleointensity measurements. Doing thus,

only the high temperature intervals, beyond 400◦C, were retained to obtain the most

reliable estimate of the strength of the ancient magnetic ﬁeld. However, not applying the

PTRM-tail test does not change the ﬂow-mean values signiﬁcantly because the samples

we selected by conventional criteria for estimating the paleointensity carry only a small

proportion of their remanence below 400◦C. The normal units yield Virtual Dipole Mo-

ments (VDM) of 6.2 and 7.7 (1022Am2) and the excursional units yield values of 3.7 and

3.4 (1022Am2). These results are quite consistent with the other Thellier determinations

from Brunhes excursion records, all characterized by a decrease of the VDM as VGP

latitude decreases. 40Ar/39Ar isotopic age determinations provide an estimate of 26±15

Kyr and 18±9 Kyr for the transitional lava ﬂows, which could correspond to the Mono

Lake excursion. However, the large error bars associated with these ages do not exclude

the hypothesis that this event is the Laschamp.

Key words: Geomagnetic excursion, Mono Lake, Laschamp, Paleointensity, 40Ar/39Ar

dating, Amsterdam Island.

1 INTRODUCTION

Just over twenty years ago Hoﬀman (1981) concluded from the characteristics of the Earth’s

magnetic ﬁeld observed during geomagnetic excursions that at least some excursions are

aborted reversals. This implies that paleomagnetic ﬁeld variations derived from such records

can be interpreted as transitional ﬁelds. Recently, Gubbins (1999) proposed a physical expla-

nation to this hypothesis. According to Gubbins excursions may occur when two reversals of

opposite sense follow one another in the liquid outer core, which has timescales of about 500

yr, within such a short time interval that the ﬁeld does not have enough time to reverse its

polarity in the solid inner core, which occurs by diﬀusion with typical timescales of 3 Kyr. In

other words, he considers that the longer dynamical timescales of the solid inner core delay

full reversals which are not complete until the magnetic ﬁeld reverses its polarity through-

out the whole Earth’s core. This physical distinction between successful and unsuccessful

reversals agrees with both the duration of excursions, estimated at a few thousands years,

and with their number of about ten observed within the Brunhes period (from 780 Kyr to

present time) (Langereis et al., 1997). To validate such models one must know the exact

duration of excursions and the frequency of their occurrences between two consecutive full

reversals. However even for the Brunhes period, we are not yet able to precisely describe the

excursion succession and their individual characteristics. Some excursions are not clearly

established, the global occurrence of some others is questioned (Langereis et al., 1997).

For example, the Mono Lake excursion (≈ 28 ka) is observed only in sediments from

the western North America (Liddicoat & Coe, 1979; Levi & Karlin, 1989; Liddicoat, 1992;

Liddicoat, 1996) and from Arctic Sea (Nowaczyk & Antonow, 1997) and thus may only re-

ﬂect a strong regional secular variation feature. To date only 6 excursions within the Brunhes

period seem well established, accurately dated and appear to occur globally. This is the case

for Laschamp (40-45 Ka), Blake (110-120 Ka), Jamaica/Pringle Falls (218 ±10 ka), Cal-

abrian Ridge 1 (315-325 ka) and 2 (515-525 ka) and Emperor/Big Lost (560-570 ka) (see

e.g. Langereis et al. (1997) and reference therein for a review). Nevertheless it is not yet

completely ascertained whether global excursions are synchronous all over the globe or start

at some locations before spreading over the entire core surface. The answer to this question

is of importance for both geodynamo models and correlations of high resolution sedimentary

sequences. Furthermore, the available data set is somewhat incomplete: most of the excur-

sions have been mainly described from recordings in sediments which are less reliable than

volcanic rocks in term of paleodirection, particularly when the ﬁeld intensity is low, which

is a common characteristic of the Brunhes excursions (Guyodo & Valet, 1999). It is however

not surprising that the volcanic recordings are rare, since due to the sporadic character of the

volcanic extrusion rate and the short duration assumed for excursions, the probability that a

lava ﬂow occurs during an excursion is very small. As a consequence, few studies have been

carried out on absolute paleointensities during Brunhes excursions (Roperch et al., 1988;

Chauvin et al., 1989; Levi et al., 1990; Quidelleur et al., 1999; Schnepp & Hradetzky, 1994;

4

Carvallo et al.

Zhu et al., 2000).

In this context, we decided to reexamine a geomagnetic excursion supposed to belong to

the Brunhes period and previously described by Watkins & Nougier (1973) in lava ﬂows from

Amsterdam Island (southeastern Indian Ocean). This event has never been radiometrically

dated. Our objectives were ﬁrst to complete the paleomagnetic record with paleointensity

determinations and to identify this geomagnetic event by radiometric dating. We also wanted

to check the presence of excursional directions. In this paper we report directional results

and high quality paleointensity determinations for four lava ﬂows from Amsterdam Island.

Theses results combined with 40Ar/39Ar isotopic ages provide more concrete evidence for

the occurrence of a geomagnetic excursion recorded in Amsterdam lava during the late

Pleistocene which may corresponds either to Mono Lake or Laschamp.

2 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND PALEOMAGNETIC SAMPLING

Amsterdam Island stands where a mantle plume is interacting with a migrating mid-ocean

ridge (Small, 1995). Amsterdam/Saint-Paul plateau was built within the past 4 Ma since the

South East Indian Ridge (SEIR) passed over the Amstardam/Saint-Paul hotspot (Royer & Schlich, 1988).

Currently, Amsterdam Island (37.5◦S, 77.3◦E) is located 50 km southwest of the SEIR,

which is migrating to the northeast away from the plume. Lying on the nearly station-

ary Antarctic plate, it has been suggested that the Amsterdam/Saint-Paul plateau is still

forming (Graham et al., 1999) and that volcanic risk still exists at Amsterdam and Saint

Paul Islands (Johnson et al., 2000). Thus located in the immediate vicinity of a mid-ocean

ridge, lava from Amsterdam has mainly tholeiitic geochemical composition, ranging from

olivine tholeiite to plagioclase basalt. From a structural point of view, this volcanic island

corresponds to a double strato-volcano (Gunn et al., 1971). The ﬁrst cycle of activity is rep-

resented by a volcano centered on the southern part of the island, where Mount du Fernand

and Le Pinion correspond to remnants of a volcanic caldera (Fig. 1). The west ﬂank of this

early volcano collapsed along two main faults oriented NW-SE and NE-SW, respectively,

Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event

5

creating about 800 m vertical oﬀset and an unreachable escarpment that exposes a multitude

of thin lava ﬂows. The second cycle of activity built the Mount de la Dives volcano, which is

a simple almost symmetrical volcanic cone rising to 881 m above sea level. This episode rep-

resents a displacement of the eruptive center of 2 km toward the east-northeast. The caldera

on top of this young cone preserves evidence of a lava lake ﬁlled by several episodes of lava

eﬀusion which overspilled as voluminous, pahoehoe lava ﬂows. The ﬂanks of this volcano

have regular slopes, 7 to 13◦, and are not dissected by erosion. Marine erosion has formed a

cliﬀ 25-50 m high at sea level around the island which makes access from the sea diﬃcult.

Although radiometric ages were not available before the present study, the nearly-pristine

morphology leaves no doubt that this volcanic activity is recent. Some parasitic cinder cones

exist on the lower ﬂanks of Mount de la Dives volcano. The youngest one is supposed to be

formed during the last century.

The paleomagnetic samples were taken in few hours during the resupply of the permanent

scientiﬁc station by the Marion-Dufresne vessel. Because of the limited schedule, we decided

to conﬁne the sampling to the northwestern coast where Watkins & Nougier (1973) studied

six lava ﬂows in a restricted area. Four of these ﬂows provided excursional directions. We

grouped Watkins & Nougier’s (1973) ﬂows 17 and 18, because of their confusing boundary

geometries, into a single unit (am1). Probably they constitute a compound lava ﬂow corre-

sponding to a single volcanic eruption. Their ﬂow 19, herein called am2, is located several

meters above and corresponds undoubtly to a diﬀerent volcanic eruption. Unfortunately, we

were not able to reach Watkins & Nougier’s (1973) ﬂows 13, 14, and 15, because of the

presence in this sector of numerous fur seals which made the access dangerous. Instead, we

sampled two previously-unstudied ﬂows (am3 and am4; Fig. 1). Seven cores from each of

ﬂows am1-2-4 and eight from ﬂow am3 were drilled using a gasoline-powered portable drill

and were oriented with respect to geographic north by means of both solar sightings and

magnetic compass plus a clinometer. Based on stratigraphic relationships, all four sampled

volcanic units belong to the youngest ﬂows of the Mount de la Dives volcano. On the basis

6

Carvallo et al.

of ﬁeld observations, ﬂow am4 is certainly younger than the other three. We have, on the

other hand, no way to decipher the age relations between ﬂows am1-2 and ﬂow am3.

3 PALEODIRECTION DETERMINATIONS

3.1 Experimental procedure

For the analysis of remanence direction, we ﬁrst treated a pilot sample from each ﬂow using

a detailed experimental procedure involving up to 13 alternating ﬁelds (AF) cleaning steps

in order to check the possible presence of unstable components of remanence. Because of the

simple behavior of remanence upon cleaning (Fig. 2), we used only 4 or 5 AF steps for the

remaining samples. Measurements of remanent magnetization were carried out with a JR-5A

spinner magnetometer and the AF treatments, with a laboratory built AF demagnetizer in

which the sample is stationary and subjected to peak ﬁelds up to 140 mT. The analysis of the

demagnetization diagrams is straightforward for all the samples but one, sample 693 from

ﬂows am3 was contaminated by a signiﬁcant parasitic magnetization of unknown origin. We

determined the Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) by means of the principal

component analysis using the Maximum Angular Deviation (MAD) (Kirschvink, 1980) as a

measure of the inherent scatter in directions. In order to check if the principal component

is a robust estimate of the sample ChRM, we compared this direction with the ﬁtting line

constrained through the origin. When the angle between these two directions exceeds the

MAD (Audunsson & Levi, 1997) we concluded that the principal component is statistically

diﬀerent from the ChRM, and thus that the ChRM is not perfectly isolated. This method led

to the rejection of only one sample (693) from further analysis, considering that no ChRM

could be successfully determined for this sample. We averaged the directions thus obtained

by ﬂow, and calculated the statistical parameters assuming a ﬁsherian distribution (Table 1).

The ChRM directions are well clustered in each ﬂow with rather small values of the 95 %

conﬁdence cone about the mean direction (α95), all ≤ 5◦.

3.2 Paleodirection results

Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event

The directional results obtained for ﬂows am1 and am2 corroborate exactly the ﬁnding by

Watkins & Nougier (1973): an intermediate polarity with associated Virtual Geomagnetic

Poles (VGPs) close to the equator is found. This result is not surprising insofar as the

remanence of the lava from Amsterdam is not contaminated by signiﬁcant spurious compo-

nents. This was not the case, for example, in a recent study on the volcanic sequence from

Possession Island (Camps et al., 2001), where the authors concluded that the intermediate

directions initially described by Watkins et al. (1972) correspond to reversed directions which

had been incompletely cleaned of their present-day ﬁeld viscous overprint. Here, we believe

that the previously published data for Amsterdam Island (Watkins & Nougier, 1973), which

were not resampled in the present study are, equally reliable.

Because ﬂows am1 and am2 yield two similar directions and because they are in a

single sequence on a small cliﬀ, one can ask whether the time elapsed between these two

ﬂows is long enough to consider them separately. To try to reply brieﬂy, we performed the

bootstrap test for a common mean (Tauxe, 1998). Because the 95 % bound interval for

the Cartesian Y and Z coordinates calculated for these two directions do not overlap each

other (Fig. 3), we concluded that these directions are statistically diﬀerent and thus can

be analyzed individually. Flows am3 and am4 give normal directions. They can be used to

complete Watkins & Nougier’s (1973) dataset in order to estimate the amplitude of secular

variation from the Indian Ocean for the Brunhes period.

4 PALEOINTENSITY DETERMINATIONS

4.1 Experimental procedure

Paleointensity determinations were carried out using the classical Thellier and Thellier

(1959) method. The samples are heated two times at each temperature step, in the presence

of a ﬁeld positive for the ﬁrst heating and negative for the second heating. Partial thermore-

8

Carvallo et al.

manent magnetization (pTRM) checks were performed every two steps in order to detect

magnetic changes during heating. We used a laboratory ﬁeld of 30 µT aligned along the

core z axis. All heatings and coolings were done in a vacuum better than 10−4 mbar with

the intention of reducing mineralogical changes during heatings, which are usually due to

oxidation. Samples were heated in 14 steps between 150 and 580 ◦C, by 50◦C between 150

and 500 ◦C, then 20◦C steps between 500 and 540◦C, and ﬁnally 10◦C steps between 540

and 580◦C. Each heating-cooling step required about 10 hours. Because paleointensity mea-

surements require time-consuming procedures, it is important to detect unsuitable samples

before carrying out the full experiments.

4.2 Sample selection and rock magnetism properties

Volcanic rocks used for absolute paleointensity determinations must satisfy the following

conditions :

(i) The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of samples must consist of a single com-

ponent close to the mean characteristic remanence direction of the ﬂow. In addition, the vis-

cosity index (Thellier & Thellier, 1944) must be small enough to obtain reliable data during

the heating demagnetization steps at low temperatures. We found that all the samples have

magnetic viscosity coeﬃcients smaller than 4%; therefore no samples were eliminated on this

basis, except sample 693 which shows a strong secondary component of magnetization.

(ii) The magnetic properties of the samples must be thermally stable. To check it, we

performed continuous low-ﬁeld magnetic susceptibility measurements under vacuum (bet-

ter than 10−2 mbar) as a function of temperature (Fig. 4) for the 28 remaining samples.

The device used for this experiment is a Bartington susceptibility meter MS2 equipped

with a furnace in which the heating and cooling rates remain constant at 7◦/mn. Seven

samples having irreversible thermomagnetic curves were rejected for the ﬁnal selection of

paleointensity results. Mean Curie temperatures (Pr´evot et al., 1983) vary between 450 and

570◦C (Table 2). These values also indicate that the magnetic carriers are mainly Ti-poor

titanomagnetite (x < 0.2) (Dunlop & ¨Ozdemir, 1997).

Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event

9

(iii) The remanence carriers must be single domain (SD) or pseudo-single domain (PSD)

grains. It is widely accepted that multi domain (MD) grains give erroneous results because

of the inequality of their blocking and unblocking temperatures and the inﬂuence of the

thermal prehistory on pTRM intensity (Vinogradov & Markov, 1989). In order to determine

the domain structure, we measured the hysteresis parameters using an alternative gradient

force magnetometer at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. According to the

criteria deﬁned by Day et al. (1977) all the hysteresis parameters are in the PSD part of the

plot (Fig. 5 and Table 2). However, a mixture of SD and MD grains could give the same

result. Most samples are characterized by a very high median destructive ﬁeld (Table 2)

which is a further evidence of the presence of SD-PSD grains.

4.3 Preliminary selection of paleointensity data

The parameters used as criteria for a preliminary data selection are deﬁned as follows, based

on selection criteria commonly used for paleointensity experiments.

(i) The number N of successive points on the linear segments chosen to calculate the

paleointensity must be at least 4.

(ii) The fraction of NRM destroyed on this segment must be greater than 1/3.

(iii) The MAD calculated with the principal component calculated in the temperature

interval used for paleointensity estimate must be less than 15◦ and the angle α between the

vector average and this principal component also less than 15◦ (Selkin & Tauxe, 2000).

(iv) The pTRM checks have to be positive, i.e. the deviation of pTRM quantiﬁed by

the diﬀerence ratio (Selkin & Tauxe, 2000), which corresponds to the maximum diﬀerence

between repeat pTRM steps normalized by the length of the selected NRM-pTRM segment,

has to be less than 10% before and within the linear segment. Failure of a pTRM check is an

indication of irreversible magnetic and/or chemical changes in the ferromagnetic minerals

during the laboratory heating.

10

Carvallo et al.

4.4 PTRM-tail test

In order to give us some indication about the domain states as a function of the tem-

perature, we performed the pTRM-tail test that was ﬁrst introduced by Bol’shakov &

Shcherbakova (1979) and modiﬁed later by Shcherbakova et al. (2000). The principle of

this test is as follows: if a sample is given a pTRM on an interval [T1, T2] (T1 > T2),

then is heated up to T1 and cooled down in zero-ﬁeld, the pTRM will be completely de-

magnetized only if the remanence carrier is single-domain. For pseudo-single-domain or

multi-domain material, the pTRM will be completely demagnetized only after heating

to a temperature higher than T1, this temperature reaching all the way to TC for MD

grains (Bol’shakov & Shcherbakova, 1979). Note that this test can only be applied to sam-

ples that do not alter chemically during heating. As discussed later, the Amsterdam samples

are unusually stable, permitting wide application of this test.

The pTRM-tail test was carried out using a thermal vibrating magnetometer which

allows the measurement of the magnetic remanence and the induced magnetization of a

rock sample. The dimensions of the sample are 11 mm height and 10 mm diameter. The

static residual ﬁeld in the heating zone is less than 20 nT. It is possible to apply a direct ﬁeld

on the sample by sending a constant current to an inner coil placed between the detection

coils and the heater. The two detection coils are connected in opposition. The sample is

alternatively translated from the center of the ﬁrst detection coil to the center of the other

detection coil with a frequency of 13.7 Hz with 25.4 mm amplitude. The heater is powered

with an alternating pulse width modulated current at a frequency of 3740 Hz. The output

signal is directly applied to the current input of the lock-in ampliﬁer Stanford Research

SR830. After signal acquisition and calibration, we measure the magnetization moment

versus temperature with a precision of 2 × 10−8Am2 (with a time constant of 300 mS).

PTRM acquisitions were performed in air on sister samples (i.e., adjoining samples from

the same paleomagnetic core), using a 100 µT ﬁeld, in four diﬀerent temperature intervals:

[300◦C, Troom], [400◦C, 300◦C], [500◦C, 400◦C] and [550◦C, 500◦C]. PTRMs were imparted

”from above”: the samples were ﬁrst demagnetized by heating them in zero ﬁeld to TC,

Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event

11

then a 100 µT is applied during the cooling down between the temperatures T1 and T2,

and pTRM(T1,T2) was measured at room temperature. Samples were subsequently heated

again to T1, cooled down in zero ﬁeld, and the tail of pTRM(T1,T2) measured at room

temperature. Fig. 6 illustrates the succession of pTRM acquisitions and demagnetizations.

We calculated the parameter A deﬁned by

A(T1, T2) =

tail[pTRM(T1, T2)]
pTRM(T1, T2)

100%

(1)

as the relative intensity measured at room temperature of the pTRM tail remaining after

heating to T1. According to the criteria deﬁned by Shcherbakova et al. (2000), A(T1, T2) < 4%

corresponds to SD, 4% < A(T1, T2) < 15% to PSD and A(T1, T2)>15% to MD. Table 2

shows the values of A(T1, T2) for the four temperature intervals used on the 17 remaining

samples. All the samples have an MD response for pTRM’s imparted in the intervals [300◦C,

Tr] and [400◦C, 300◦C]. However they all have a PSD response (except sample 669 which

has an MD response) for the pTRM given in the interval [500◦C, 400◦C], and PSD or SD

response for a pTRM given in the interval [550◦C, 500◦C]. Fig. 7 illustrates typical MD

and SD thermomagnetic behavior. Guided by these results we did not include any point on

the Arai plot acquired before 400◦C (500◦C for sample 669) to calculate the paleointensity

estimates.

4.5 Paleointensity results

Results are plotted as NRM lost as a function of pTRM gained on an Arai graph (Nagata et al., 1963).

Examples of typical good samples are shown on Fig. 8 with associated orthogonal vector di-

agrams. Fourteen samples fulﬁlled all the criteria deﬁned above and were then considered as

yielding reliable results (Table 3). Most results have high quality factor (q) values (between

15 and 70) and the success rate of 50%, calculated on the whole collection, is very high and

somewhat unusual for natural rocks.

Averaging four acceptable results, the ﬂow am1 (excursional unit) gives a paleointen-

sity of 24.6 µT and a Virtual Dipole Moment (VDM) of 3.7×1022 Am2 (Table 3). The ﬂow

am2 (excursional unit) gives an average paleointensity (using two results) of 24.0 µT, corre-

12

Carvallo et al.

sponding to a VDM of 3.4×1022 Am2. The two normal ﬂows (am3 and am4) give averages

of 32.8µT (using 5 values) and 46.9µT (using 3 values), yielding VDM’s of 6.2×1022 Am2

and 7.7×1022 Am2, respectively.

5 40Ar / 39Ar AGE DETERMINATIONS

5.1 Analytical procedure

For each sample, 300 mg of whole rock fragments were carefully hand-picked under a binoc-

ular microscope from crushed 0.5 mm thick rock slabs. The samples were wrapped in Cu

foil to form small packets as small as possible (11x11 mm.). These packets were stacked up

to form a pile within which packets of ﬂux monitors were inserted every 5 to 10 samples,

according to the size of the samples. The stack, put in an irradiation can, was irradiated,

with a Cd shield, for 1 hr at the McMaster University reactor (Hamilton, Canada) with

a total ﬂux of 1.3 x 1017 n.cm−2. The irradiation standard was the Fish-Canyon sanidine

(28.02 Ma; Renne et al. (1998)).

The sample arrangement allows monitoring of the ﬂux gradient with a precision as low

as ±0.2 %. The step-heating experiment procedure was described in details by Ruﬀet et
al. (1991). The mass spectrometer consists of a 120 M.A.S.S.E. R(cid:13) tube, a B¨aur Signer R(cid:13)
source and an SEV 217 R(cid:13) electron-multiplier (total gain: 5×1012 ) whereas the all metal
extraction and puriﬁcation lines include two SAES GP50W getters with St101 R(cid:13) zirconium-

aluminium alloy operating at 400◦C and a -95◦C cold trap. Samples were incrementally

heated in a molybdenum crucible using a double vacuum high frequency furnace. The ex-

traction segment of the line was pumped 3 minutes between each step.

Isotopic measurements are corrected for K and Ca isotopic interferences and mass dis-

crimination. All errors are quoted at the 1σ level and do not include the errors on the

40Ar∗/39ArK ratio and age of the monitor. The error in the 40Ar∗/39ArK ratio of monitor is

included in the isochron age error bars calculation.

5.2 40Ar∗/39ArK results

Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event

13

The very low K- and rather high Ca-contents of the analyzed samples and their very young

apparent age were unfavorable parameters to produce high quality analyses and to obtain

unambiguous results. The classical calculation method using an 40Ar/36Ar atmospheric ratio

measured on an air aliquot resulted in zero apparent ages for successive degassing steps,

probably as a result of an inadequate procedure for determining this ratio. The very high

ratio of the measured atmospheric to the radiogenic 40Ar favors use of isochron calculation

(correlation method: 36Ar/40Ar versus 39Ar∗/40ArK; e.g. Turner (1971); Roddick et al. (1980);

Hanes et al. (1985)). This method does not require ”a priori” knowledge of the measured

40Ar/36Ar atmospheric ratio. Two argon components can be identiﬁed using this calculation

method: the ﬁrst one, related to the atmosphere, is usually weakly linked to the mineral;

the other one, supplied by radioactive decay of 40Ar, is trapped in minerals structures. The

aim of degassing by steps is to separate, at least partly, these two components, which allows

a mixing line to be deﬁned, the isochron. In whole rock analysis, a meaningful isochron

must be calculated on a degassing segment which corresponds to the degassing of a speciﬁc

mineral phase.

All analyzed samples display rather constant CaO/K2O calculated ratios in the in-

termediate temperature range, around 11 (CaO/K2O = 37ArCa/39ArK×2.179; Deckart et

al. (1997)), which suggest degassing of a homogeneous phase, probably plagioclase as ob-

served in thin sections. Very young calculated isochron ages (Fig. 9), concordant at the 2 σ

level, are obtained from the corresponding degassing steps (Table 4). They suggest that the

two sampled lava ﬂows with intermediate directions could be as young as 20-25 ka and the

lava ﬂow (am3) with the normal direction slightly older at ca 45 ka.

6 DISCUSSION

6.1 Reliability of paleointensity estimates

The determination of absolute paleointensity by the Thellier method imposes many con-

straints on rock magnetic properties which are often not respected in natural rocks. The

failure rate is usually around 70-90% (Perrin, 1998). We obtained results of very good tech-

nical quality for 50% of the samples in this study. Nevertheless a recent study carried out

on historical lava ﬂows from Mount Etna showed that samples which fulﬁlled all the relia-

bility criteria imposed by the authors could yield a paleointensity exceeding the real ﬁeld

paleomagnitude by as much as 25% (Calvo et al., 2002). It should never be forgotten that

measurements of paleointensity are only estimates. Therefore we wish to discuss further the

reliability of the paleointensity measurements performed in the present study.

First, we can make sure that the part of NRM used must be a TRM. We compared con-

tinuous thermal demagnetization curves of NRM and artiﬁcial (total) TRM of sister samples

measured using the thermal vibrating magnetometer. The artiﬁcial TRM was imparted in

the direction of the NRM. Samples have to be drilled in the direction of the NRM; therefore

we did this test only for 3 samples because we did not have enough material. A result is

shown in Fig. 10. The remarkable similarity between the thermal demagnetization of the

NRM and of the artiﬁcial TRM suggests that the NRM is a TRM and conﬁrms the thermal

stability of Amsterdam lava.

Thermal stability can be further tested independently by comparing the laboratory

Koenigsberger ratios before and after heating. The ratio before heating is calculated ac-

cording to the formula:

QL =

Mnrm
ka.Ha

,

Q′

L =

Mtrm
kb.Hlab

,

where Mnrm is the natural remanent magnetization, ka is the bulk magnetic susceptibility

measured before paleointensity experiments and Ha is the ancient ﬁeld obtained from the

paleointensity experiments. The ratio after heating is deﬁned by:

(2)

(3)

Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event

15

where Mtrm is the total TRM obtained by extrapolation of the data corresponding to the

highest temperatures on the Arai plot, kb is the bulk magnetic susceptibility obtained after

heating and Hlab is the laboratory ﬁeld. We observed that the two Koenigsberger ratios

have similar values for the samples that gave reliable paleointensity results (Table 5). This

suggests that these samples are thermally stable.

The hysteresis parameters (Fig. 5 and Table 2) show that all the samples have a behavior

characteristic of PSD grains. In natural samples, this is usually interpreted as the indication

of a mixture of SD-PSD and MD grains. We found that one of the advantages of perform-

ing the pTRM-tail-test over measuring hysteresis parameters is to allow us to discriminate

between MD, PSD and SD thermomagnetic behavior. This test qualiﬁes directly the TRM

behavior, contrary to the hysteresis curves which make tests on remanent or induced magne-

tizations of isothermal origin. Moreover, it seems that measurement of hysteresis parameters

as a function of temperature sometimes does not allow detection of changes in domain struc-

ture with heating (Carvallo & Dunlop, 2001). We note in Fig. 5 that the accepted samples

(black dots) generally have higher Mrs/Ms than the rejected samples (white dots). Thus, on

average the better samples for paleointensity are a little smaller in eﬀective magnetic grain

size.

6.2 pTRM-tail-test : A new tool for paleointensity experiments ?

The main methodological originality of the present study is the use of pTRM-tail tests to se-

lect the most suitable portion of the NRM-TRM diagrams. Many authors (e.g., Shcherbakova

et al. (2000)) have suggested that recognizing the multidomain component in the paleointen-

sity experiment is critical for the exactitude of the ﬁnal result. The presence of multidomain

grains will invalidate the Thellier method if the unblocking temperature does not equal

the blocking temperature any more. Using the part of the Arai plot derived from multido-

main behavior can thus lead to large errors in the paleointensity measurement. For example,

Shcherbakov & Shcherbakova (2001) showed that, if one were to ignore the continuous

curvature and ﬁt a line to low temperature data points of synthetic, purely MD samples,

16

Carvallo et al.

one could overestimate the true value by as much as 60%. For the majority of the sam-

ples that we tested, the relative tails A(T1, T2) are very large when pTRM is imparted

at low-temperatures (300◦C-Troom and 400◦C-300◦C), but become smaller and smaller for

higher temperature intervals Table 2, which led us to reject all points acquired below 400◦C

in calculating the paleointensities. Shcherbakova et al. (2000) as well as Shcherbakov &

Shcherbakova (2001) also observed a diminution of the pTRM tail with increasing temper-

ature intervals, using both natural and synthetic samples.

In our case, this behavior could be explained in several ways.

(i) Our natural samples are composed of a mixture of grains having diﬀerent sizes. It is

possible that the MD part of the remanence carriers have lower Curie temperature, whereas

PSD and SD grains carry the high-temperature remanence (Dunlop & ¨Ozdemir, 2001). A

simpliﬁed explanation of what is observed with the variations of A parameters is that mainly

MD grains are magnetized when they are given a low temperature pTRM (< 400◦C), yield-

ing high A values. For high temperature pTRMs (> 400◦C), mainly PSD/SD grains are

magnetized and give very small tails. Another indication of the presence of MD material

can be extracted from the pTRM acquisition curve: when the ﬁeld is switched oﬀ during

the cooling, the magnetic moment drops because of the presence of induced magnetization

which is more important for MD than SD grains. For example, the pTRM (500◦C,400◦C)

acquired by sample 680 has a large tail (60%), and the magnetic moment drops of about

50% when the ﬁeld is switched oﬀ at 400◦C (Fig. 7). But for sample 675, which has a tail for

the pTRM(550◦C, 500◦C) of only 2.2%, the drop when the ﬁeld is switched oﬀ is also much

smaller (about 10% of the remanence acquired at this temperature). This is a general trend

observed for the ensemble of the pTRM acquisitions-demagnetizations (Fig. 11), although a

more precise correlation is diﬃcult to establish.

(ii) Alternatively, one could argue that for the samples having high Curie points, the high

values of the low temperature pTRM tails might be only due to the fact that the pTRMs

acquired in these intervals are actually very low. The diﬀerence between the magnetic mo-

ment measured after acquisition of a small pTRM and the magnetic moment measured after

Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event

17

its demagnetization might then not be signiﬁcant of any physical process but only reﬂect an

artifact created by the accuracy of the measurement. However, the ranges of magnetization

measured are in most cases well above the sensitivity of the vibrating magnetometer, so we

can be quite conﬁdent that the measured values of A in Table 2 are physically meaningful.

From a practical point of view, the pTRM-tail test was not critical for these Amsterdam

basalt samples. Before knowing the A(T1,T2) values, we selected samples and temperature

steps for estimating paleointensity from our Thellier data using conventional criteria –i.e.,

essentially items i-iv described above in section 4.3. The ﬂow-mean values thus obtained do

not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those obtained by adding further data selection according to the

pTRM-tail test. In retrospect, this is not unexpected because, the selected samples have 57

to 91% (on average 81%) of their TRM remaining after thermal demagnetization to 400◦C.

Thus, the pTRM tails of the low-temperature points are too small to have an appreciable

eﬀect on the slope of the best-ﬁt lines of the Arai diagrams, that is, on the paleointensity

estimate. More diﬃcult to understand is the low-temperature slope of sample 680 which

have more than 30% of its remanence below 400◦C. Its multidomain-size pTRM tails would

lead one to expect slope corresponding to large overestimated of paleointensity, but actually

that for 680 is too low by 33%. At this time we have no explanation for the departure of

this sample from the behavior expected for multidomain grains (Dunlop & ¨Ozdemir, 2001;

Shcherbakov & Shcherbakova, 2001).

6.3 Implication for the excursional ﬁeld characteristics

Studies carried out on absolute paleointensity during the Brunhes period show generally a

decrease of the VDM value when the colatitude of the VGP increases. This trend is illus-

trated in Fig. 12a in which we gathered Brunhes VDMs from the paleointensity database

PINT2000 using as the unique selection criteria the Thellier paleointensity method. The

VDM obtained in the present study, showing approximately a ratio of 2 between the normal

and the excursional ﬁeld, ﬁt well in this general tendency. In Fig. 12b, we have randomly

generated 500 VDMs from the statistical model of Camps & Pr´evot (1996) for ﬂuctuations

18

Carvallo et al.

in the geomagnetic ﬁeld, using the model parameters proposed for the Icelandic data set.

In this model, the local ﬁeld vector is the sum of two independent sets of vectors: a nor-

mally distributed axial dipole component plus an isotropic set of vectors with a Maxwellian

distribution that simulates secular variation. It is worth pointing out that the trend in the

experimental VDMs for the Brunhes period is very well reproduced in this statistical model.

We do note that this simulation also predicts some outliers data – high VDMs correspond-

ing to excursional VGPs – as it sometimes observed in the Brunhes experimental data set

(Fig. 12a) and as has been also recently reported for a mid Miocene excursion recorded in

Canary Island lavas (Leonhardt et al., 2000).

Abnormal VGPs from the Amsterdam excursion tend to group over the Caribbean Sea

(Fig. 13). The question of whether this cluster represents a long-lived transitional state of

the ﬁeld or is an artifact due to a rapid extrusion of successive lavas must be addressed.

First, Watkins & Nougier (1973) concluded from geological ﬁeld observations that Ams-

terdam excursion seems to correspond to two successive departures of the VGPs from the

present geographic pole which recorded very similar VGP locations. They argued that one

of the excursional ﬂow (their ﬂow 24) belongs to the old volcanic episode whereas all the

other excursional ﬂows (their ﬂows 13,17-19), although they yield a similar abnormal direc-

tion, are part of a more recent volcanic phase. We know from experience that stratigraphic

correlations are often speculative in volcanic area, hence we ﬁnd their argument quite weak.

However we have no reason to rule out their conclusion since we did not carry out a ﬁeld anal-

ysis. Next, we note that one of the excursional VGP from the Laschamp event (Fig. 13b)

has also a location within the Amsterdam cluster. Finally, we point out that Camps et

al. (2001) have described a Plio-Pleistocene normal-transitional-normal excursion recorded

in lava ﬂows from Possession Island, a volcanic island located in the southern India ocean

2300 km southwestward from Amsterdam. Interestingly, this excursion is characterized by a

clustering of transitional VGPs also located in the vicinity of the Caribbean Sea (Fig. 13c).

Although this excursion is not radiometrically dated, we are certain from geological consid-

erations that it is older than the Amsterdam excursion . Thus, the transitional ﬁeld of at

Mono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event

19

least two distinct excursions would have revisited the same VGP location. These observa-

tions suggest that the Amsterdam excursional cluster may represents a recurring preferred

location for transitional VGPs like that was previously proposed (Hoﬀman, 1992).

At present, the Ar/Ar isotopic ages suggest that the Amsterdam excursion corresponds

to a late Pleistocene excursion. During this period, two geomagnetic events are described in

the literature. It concerns the Mono Lake excursion, documented in several lacustrine sedi-

mentary sections from the western USA, which is dated to ≈28 14C ka (Liddicoat, 1992), and

the Laschamp excursion, described for the ﬁrst time in lava ﬂows from La chaine des Puys,

Massif Central France, and dated to ≈ 42 ka (see Kent et al. (2002) for a review). If evidences

for the Laschamp excursion are found in numerous deep-sea sediment records, this is not the

case for the Mono Lake which is only described jointly with Laschamp from high deposition

rate sediments in the North Atlantic (Nowaczyk & Antonow, 1997; Laj et al., 2000). At the

present time, the existence of two geomagnetic excursions in the late Pleistocene is directly

questioned by Kent et al. (2002). Using new 14C dates on carbonates and 40Ar/39Ar sanidine

dates on ash layers, they concluded that Mono Lake excursion at Wilson Creek should be

regarded as a record of the Laschamp excursion. Unfortunately, the large error bars asso-

ciated with ours ages estimate for the Amsterdam excursion do not allow to bring insight

into this debate. We point out here that our preferred hypothesis, taking into account the

age of 26±15 and 18±9 ka obtained for Amsterdam excursional ﬂows, is to correlate this

excursion with a geomagnetic event younger than 30 Ka which could correspond to Mono

Lake if we consider the former age estimate of 28 Ka (Liddicoat, 1992). This conclusion

requires however a further conﬁrmation with a more accurate age control, but if it is true,

Amsterdam excursion would represent ﬁrm evidence for a global occurrence of Mono Lake

excursion. Finally, it is interesting to point out that the original record of Mono Lake excur-

sion at Wilson Creek (Liddicoat & Coe, 1979) shows, as the Amsterdam excursion seems to

do, two successive excursional loops (Fig. 13a).

7 CONCLUSIONS

(i) We have identiﬁed an excursion of the geomagnetic ﬁeld in the late Pleistocene recorded

in volcanic rocks from Amsterdam Island, Indian Ocean. Good quality alternating ﬁeld

demagnetization results show that two ﬂows have excursional polarities with VGP latitudes

of 15.2◦and 21.2◦, and two ﬂows have normal polarities (VGP latitudes are 85.5◦and 77.4◦).

(ii) 40Ar/39Ar dating did not enable us to precisely specify which excursion we identiﬁed.

Mono Lake is the most likely, but the large error bars in the ﬁnal dates do not exclude the

possibility for theses rocks to have recorded the Laschamp excursion. Indeed, some authors

believe the two excursions are the same (Kent et al., 2002)

(iii) High-quality paleointensity determinations show low VDM values for the excursional

ﬂows (3.7×1022 Am2 and 3.4×1022 Am2), whereas normal ﬂows have VDMs close to the

present-day VDM (6.2×1022 Am2 and 7.7×1022 Am2). These low values are in agreement

with other VDMs determinations during excursions in the Brunhes period and corroborates

the fact that the VDM decreases when the colatitude of VGP increases.

(iv) For the ﬁrst time, pTRM-tail-tests from above were used as a selection criteria for the

paleointensity determinations. We found that most of our samples exhibit a tail characteristic

of MD material for pTRMs given at low temperature and SD-like for high-temperature

pTRMs. Therefore we rejected measurements acquired at low-temperature (> 400◦C) for

the best-ﬁt on the Arai plots.

Figure 7. Thermomagnetic curves acquired during pTRM acquisition (top) and pTRM demagne-
tization (bottom). In example A the pTRM is imparted on the interval (400◦C-300◦C). Subsequent
demagnetization to 400◦C leaves an important tail. In example B, the pTRM is imparted on the
interval (550◦-500◦C) and is almost completely demagnetized after heating back to 550◦C.

n/N is the number of samples used in the analysis/total number of samples

collected; Inc. and Dec. are the mean inclination positive downward and dec-

lination east of north, respectively; α95 and κ are the 95% conﬁdence cone

about average direction and the concentration parameter of Fisher statistics,

respectively; δ is the reversal angle measured in degrees from the direction of

the dipole axial ﬁeld direction; Lat. and Long. are latitude and longitude of

corresponding VGP position, respectively; χ is the geometric mean suscepti-
bility (×10−6 SI); J20A/m is the geometric mean remanence intensity in A/m

measured after a magnetic treatment of 20 mT. The ﬂow am1 corresponds to

Watkins and Nougier’s (1973) ﬂows 17 and 18 combined (see text for expla-

nation) and am2 to their ﬂow 19.

TC is the mean Curie temperature (◦C) calculated according to the method of Pr´evot et

al. (1983). The conﬁdence intervals for the Curie temperatures indicate the temperature

range in which the KT curve correspond to a straight line. MDF is the Median Destructive

alternating Field in mT; Mrs/Ms and Hcr/Hc are the hysteresis parameters; A values are

the relative intensities measured at room temperature of the pTRM tail expressed in

percent A(T1, T2) = tail[pTRM(T1, T2)]/pTRM(T1, T2). B values shown in parentheses

correspond to the percent of the total pTRM (e.g., Pi pTRMi) each pTRM(T1,T2)
represents; intensities are measured at room temperature. nd means not determined. Note

that sample 674 broke itself before the acquisition of the pTRM(550-500) was completed.

Thus, we were not able to calculate B values for this sample.

Sample is an identiﬁer of a sample used for the paleointensity determination; Fe is paleointensity es-

timate (in µT ) for individual specimen, and (σ Fe) is its standard error; T1andT2 are the minimum
and maximum of the temperature range in ◦C used to determine paleointensity; n is the number of

points in the T1 − T2 interval; f, g, and q are NRM fraction, gap factor and quality factor, respec-

tively (Coe et al., 1978); MAD is the maximum angular deviation calculated along with the principal

component for the NRM left in the T1 − T2 interval; α is the angle in degrees between the vector

average and the principal component calculated for the NRM left in the T1 − T2 interval; Drat is

expressed in percent and corresponds to the diﬀerence ratio between repeat pTRM steps normalized
by the length of the selected NRM-pTRM segment (Selkin & Tauxe, 2000); ¯FE is unweighted average

paleointensity of individual lava ﬂow and its standard deviation and VDM is the corresponding virtual

dipole moment (×1022Am2).

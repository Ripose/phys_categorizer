Abstract

In this paper, we propose to use the scatter of celestial pole oﬀset (CPO) series
obtained from VLBI observations as a measure of the accuracy of the celestial refer-
ence frame (CRF) realizations. Several scatter indices (SIs) including those proposed
for the ﬁrst time are investigated. The ﬁrst SI is based on analysis of residuals of
CPO series w.r.t. Free Core Nutation (FCN) model. The second group of SIs includes
Allan deviation and its extensions, which allow one to treat unequal and multidimen-
sional observations. Application of these criteria to several radio source catalogues
showed their ability to perform a preliminary assessment of the quality of radio source
catalogues, and 2D Allan deviation estimate seems to be a most sensitive measure.
However, in common case, the sensitivity of tested criteria is yet not suﬃcient to dis-
tinguish between radio source catalogues of the highest quality. Proposed extensions
of Allan deviation, weighted and multidimensional, can be eﬀectively used also for
statistical analysis of astro-geodetic and other time series.

Introduction

Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is the base technique provided International Celes-
tial Reference Frame (ICRF) realized as a set of radio source coordinates (Ma et al. 1998).
Improvement of the ICRF accuracy is one of the primary task for International VLBI Ser-
vice for Astrometry and Geodesy (IVS), and assessment of the ICRF accuracy is of primary
importance in its improvement (Schl¨uter et al. 2002).

Many studies of the accuracy of the ICRF have been performed during last years. Some
authors have investigated the time behavior of radio source position, e.g. Gontier et al.
(2001), Feissel-Vernier (2003). Others have studied the accuracy of diﬀerent CRF realizations
by means of investigation of stability of the coordinate axis, e.g. Arias (1988), Arias (2004).
However, existing method allow us to investigate only diﬀerences between Celestial Reference
Frame (CRF) realizations, or, in other words, radio source position catalogues. There is no
evident and received method to assess the absolute ICRF accuracy.

1

In this paper, we consider possible criteria, which allow one to assess the accuracy of
radio source catalogues from its impact on results of determination of the celestial pole
oﬀset (CPO) from VLBI observations. We propose to use the scatter of CPO time series
obtained from VLBI observations as a measure of the accuracy of the CRF realizations.
Several scatter indices (SIs), including those proposed for the ﬁrst time are investigated.
The ﬁrst SI is based on analysis of residuals of CPO series from a reference series obtained
as the IAU2000A precession-nutation model with addition of the Free Core Nutation (FCN)
contribution. The second group of SIs includes Allan deviation (ADEV) and its extensions.
Two such extensions are proposed. The ﬁrst one, weighted Alan variance WADEV, which
allow one to treat unequal measurements, which we mostly deal with in geodesy. The second
extension of the classical deﬁnition is weighted multidimensional Allan deviation estimator
WMADEV, which can be applied to combined analysis of several associated time series.

We have applied these SIs to several radio source position catalogues. The tested cat-
alogues of the ﬁrst group were obtained in the framework of the joint pilot project of the
International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and the IVS (Ma 2004,
Call for Participation). The second group of catalogues consists of the latest submissions
of IVS Analysis Centers to the IVS. The latest ICRF realization, ICRF-Ext.2 (Fey 2004),
was also tested in this study. Based on the results of this work, we can make a conclusion
on ability of various SIs to detect diﬀerence in accuracy (quality) of the CRF realizations
provided by VLBI Analysis Centers.

2 Scatter indices

Investigation of the scatter of a time series of geodetic, geodynamical or other data under
interest is proven to be a powerful tool for assessment of its quality and statistical charac-
teristics. The scatter of the time series can be computed in diﬀerent way. We will use the
term ”scatter index” (SI) to distinguish the results obtained by diﬀerent methods. Advan-
tage of using SIs for investigation of time series is its independence, in the most of cases, of
systematic errors in tested results, trends and low-frequency variations.

2.1 Residuals in CPO series

Both precision and accuracy of the CPO estimates directly depend on accuracy of radio
source positions used during VLBI data processing. There is no external absolutely accurate
reference series that may be used for comparison, for only VLBI technique provides the
highly-accurate CPO measurements.

The scatter of Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) time series is widely used for many
years for comparison of EOP results obtained in diﬀerent analysis centers. We will try to
apply it to comparison of CRF realization. Similar test was used in Feissel-Vernier et al.
(2006), where the authors compared several radio source catalogues obtained in the course
of their work using the WRMS diﬀerences with the IAU2000 precession-nutation model.
However, it seems that such a test can be improved by using of the observed correction to
the IAU2000 model, the contribution of the Free Core Nutation in the ﬁrst place. In such
a case, the residuals between VLBI nutation series and model becomes much less, and the

2

test, hopefully, will be more sensitive. Thus we used the IAU2000A model with addition
of the FCN contribution as the reference series. For our purpose, we computed the FCN
contribution by smoothing of the diﬀerences between the IVS combined EOP series and the
IAU2000A model.

However, this SI cannot be considered as really independent estimate of the CPO scatter
since any FCN model derived from a comparison of observations with theory depends on
results of VLBI data processing. Evidently, such an estimate implicitly depends on underly-
ing CRF realizations. Hence, FCN criterion provides only comparison of tested radio source
catalogue realization with some averaged CRF realization.

2.2 Allan deviation

Allan variance estimator was originally developed for investigation of noise parameters of
frequency standards. In the last years, Allan-variance-based techniques is often applied to
analysis of geodetic and geodynamical time series. Usually, square root of Allan variance
ADEV is used for this purpose. IERS EOP Product Center employs this technique for assess-
ment of the statistical characteristics of the EOP series (Gambis 2002). ADEV estimates are
used for investigation of stochastic properties of station coordinates time series, e.g. Malkin
& Voinov (2001), Le Bail & Feissel-Vernier (2003), Feissel-Vernier & Le Bail (2005), Le Bail
(2006). Feissel-Vernier (2003) has also used Allan variance for analysis of the noise in radio
source position time series.

Allan deviation estimate for time series y1, y2, . . . , yn is given by

ADEV = v
u
u
t

(yi+1 − yi)2 .

Commonly speaking, this formula is valid for equal measurements. However, in geodetic
and astrometric practice, we usually deal with unequal measurements. In this case, we have
the measurements with associated uncertainties s1, s2, . . . , sn. To treat unequal data, the
following extension of ADEV can be proposed.

Fig. 1 shows an example of actual series of station coordinates, which show that the

diﬀerence between ADEV and WADEV values may be quite substantial.

Further extension of WADEV estimator is useful for analysis of some types of time series.
When the statistical parameters of astro-geodetic time series are investigated, we, in fact,
often deal with multidimensional values, e.g. terrestrial coordinates and/or velocity (3D or
6D), celestial coordinates and/or proper motion (2D or 4D), and so on. In such a case, we
can use multidimensional notation yi = (y1
i , y2
i ) with the associated k-dimensional
i , s2
uncertainties si = (s1
i ). Thus, we can deﬁne the k-dimensional Allan deviation as

i , . . . , yk

It is needless to say that both WADEV and WMADEV estimates can be easily gener-
alized, like classical ADEV estimate, for diﬀerent sampling interval as well as overlapping
intervals.

3 Comparison of catalogues

For our study, we computed several CPO time series with the same processing options,
except diﬀerent underlying radio source catalogues. We used 504 R1 and R4 VLBI sessions
observed in the period 2002.0–2007.0. Then we compute the SI described above for all the
series.

We included in this comparison three groups of VLBI CRF realizations. First, we used
eight radio source catalogues obtained in the framework of the joint IERS-IVS Pilot Project
mentioned above. The catalogues were provided by eight IVS Analysis Centers: AUS (Geo-
science Australia), BKG (Bundesamt f¨ur Kartographie und Geod¨asie, Germany), DGFI
(Deutsches Geod¨atisches ForschungsInstitut, Germany), GSF (NASA Goddard Space Flight
Center, USA), JPL (Caltech/NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, USA), MAO (Main Astro-
nomical Observatory of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), SHA (Shanghai Astro-
nomical Observatory, China), USN (U. S. Naval Observatory, USA). Each Analysis Center

has submitted two version of catalogue. The ﬁrst one was computed using all available VLBI
data. For the second version, only the observations made since 1990 have been used. Then
we included in our study six radio source catalogues submitted by IVS Analysis Centers in
2006–2007 in the framework of routine operations. The latest ICRF realization, ICRF-Ext.2
(Fey 2004), was also used in our study.

Results of this test are presented in Table 1.

In the table, FCN column shows the
WRMS diﬀerences between CPO series computed with given radio source catalogue and
IAU2000A+FCN reference series, ADEV and WADEV columns contain classical and weighted
Allan variance estimates. The values presented in the FCN, ADEV and WADEV columns
are computed as the mean of the estimates for X and Y celestial pole coordinates. The
WMADEV column contains 2D estimates computed with (3), k = 2, for both pole coordi-
nates.

One can see that the accuracy of all the compared catalogues as estimated by this method
is close to each other. Nevertheless, some discrepancies can be clearly seen. In particular,

the ICRF-Ext.2 showed the worst result, maybe because ITRF-Ext.2 212 deﬁning source
positions were saved from the ﬁrst ICRF. This can be mentioned that, in the analyzed data,
186 deﬁning sources were observed of total number of 507 (i.e. 36.6%), and there were 307155
observations of deﬁning sources of total number of 953637 (i.e. 32.2%). If so, it might be
inadvisable to keep coordinates of the deﬁning ICRF sources in the successive ICRF updates.
The organizers of the IERS-IVS Pilot Project requested from the participating Analysis
Centers to submit two versions of catalogues obtained using all available data (version 1) and
data from 1900 only (version2). The intention was to investigate an impact of data selection
on the quality of CRF realization. From our test, one can see that catalogues of version 2
show small but steady improvement of the accuracy. This eﬀect can be also explained by
the greater weight of R1/R4 sessions in the catalogues of version 2 w.r.t. catalogues of
the version 1 though. On the other hand, previous studies (Malkin 2004a,b) have shown
that both EOP and precession parameters derived from VLBI observations show much less
uncertainty when only data from 1990 are used for analysis.

As to comparison of diﬀerent SIs considered in this test, 2D Allan variance seems to
be the most sensitive criterion. It is advisable to use the weighted multidimensional Allan
deviation for investigation of other astro-geodetic multidimensional time series.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we tested a possibility of using the scatter of celestial pole oﬀset (CPO) series
obtained from VLBI observations as a measure of the accuracy of the CRF realizations.
Several scatter indices (SIs), including those proposed for the ﬁrst time are investigated.

The ﬁrst SI is based on analysis of residuals of CPO series w.r.t. IAU2000A precession-
nutation model supplemented with the FCN contribution. It turned out to be less sensitive
than other tested SIs. Besides this SI cannot be considered as fully independent since both
IAU2000A model and FCN contribution depend on previous VLBI data analysis, in partic-
ular, used CRF realizations. Conversely, the SIs based on Allan deviation and its extensions
proposed in this paper provide independent estimate of the quality of CRF realizations.

Application of these criteria to several radio source catalogues has shown their ability to
perform a preliminary assessment of the quality of radio source catalogues, and 2D Allan
deviation estimate seems to be a most sensitive measure. However, the sensitivity of tested
criteria is yet not suﬃcient to distinguish between radio source catalogues of the highest
quality.

Proposed extensions of the Allan deviation estimator, weighted WADEV and multidi-
mensional WMADEV, can be eﬀectively used also for statistical analysis of geodetic and
other time series, e.g. Earth Orientation Parameters and station position time series.

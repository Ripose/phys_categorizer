Biot’s theory of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid
revisited: introduction of non-zero boundary slip velocity

David Tsiklauri∗

It is known that a boundary slip velocity starts to play important role when the length scale over
which the ﬂuid velocity changes approaches the slip length, i.e. when the ﬂuid is highly conﬁned, for
example, ﬂuid ﬂow through porous rock or blood vessel capillaries. Craig et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
87, 054504-1-4 (2001)] have recently experimentally established existence of a boundary slip in a
Newtonian liquid. We investigate the eﬀect of introduction of the boundary slip into the theory of
propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous medium formulated by Biot [J. Acoust. Soc.
Am. , 28, 179-191 (1956)]. Namely, we study the eﬀect of introduction of boundary slip upon the
function F (κ) that measures the deviation from Poiseuille ﬂow friction as a function of frequency
parameter κ. We established substantial deviations, especially in the asymptotical limit of high
frequencies, in the behavior of F (κ) with the incorporation of the boundary slip into the model.
It is known that F (κ) crucially enters Biot’s equations which describe dynamics of ﬂuid-saturated
porous solid. We, thus, investigated consequences of the non-zero boundary slip by calculating the
phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients of the both rotational and dilatational waves with the
variation of frequency. We established that introduction of the boundary slip into the Biot’s theory
drastically changes most of its predictions.

INTRODUCTION

It has been a common practice in the ﬂuid dynamics
to assume that when a ﬂuid ﬂows over an interface with
a solid, the ﬂuid molecules adjacent to the solid have
zero relative velocity with the respect to solid. So far,
this widely used assumption, known as ”no-slip bound-
ary condition”, has been successfully applied to the the-
oretical modeling of almost all macroscopic experiments.
As relevantly noticed by Craig et al.
[1], the success of
this assumption does not reﬂect its accuracy, but rather
insensitivity of the experiment to a partial-slip boundary
condition. It is known that the boundary slip becomes
important only when the length scale over which the ﬂuid
velocity changes approaches the slip length, that is the
distance behind the interface at which the ﬂuid velocity
extrapolates to zero, i.e. when the ﬂuid becomes highly
conﬁned, e.g., blood ﬂow through capillaries or ﬂuid ﬂow
through natural porous rock. Recently, Craig at al.
[1]
presented a convincing experimental evidence of a bound-
ary slip in a Newtonian liquid. Craig et al. performed di-
rect measurements of the hydrodynamic drainage forces,
which show a clear evidence of boundary slip. They found
that the boundary slip is a function of the ﬂuid viscosity
and the shear rate. These results have important implica-
tions for the blood dynamics in capillaries, the permeabil-
ity of porous media, and lubrication of nano-machines.
For example, results of Craig et al.
suggest that red
blood cells squeeze through narrow capillary walls more
easily and induce less shear stress on capillary walls due

to the boundary slip. Also, in oil production industry,
the residual oil is diﬃcult to produce due to its naturally
low mobility. Thus, the enhanced oil recovery operations
are used to increase production. It has been experimen-
tally proven that there is a substantial increase in the
net ﬂuid ﬂow through a porous medium if the latter is
treated with elastic waves [2, 3, 4, 5]. We may conjecture
that the elastic waves via the pore wall vibration cause
boundary slip of the residual oil droplets, which likewise
red blood cells, squeeze through pores with less resis-
tance, eﬀectively increasing permeability of the porous
medium.

A quantitative theory of propagation of elastic waves
in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid has been formulated in
the classic papers by Biot [6]. After its appearance, this
theory has seen numerous modiﬁcations and generaliza-
tions. One of the major ﬁndings of Biot’s work was that
there was a breakdown in Poiseuille ﬂow above a certain
characteristic frequency speciﬁc to this ﬂuid-saturated
porous material. Biot theoretically studied this break-
down by considering the ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid in a tube
with longitudinally oscillating walls under an oscillatory
pressure gradient. Biot’s theory can be used to describe
interaction of ﬂuid-saturated porous solid with sound for
a classic Newtonian ﬂuid assuming no-slip boundary con-
dition at the pore walls holds. However, in the light of
recent experimental results of Craig et al. [1], revision of
the classic theory is needed in order to investigate novel-
ties bought about by the boundary slip.

In the section II we formulate theoretical basis of our
model and in section III we present our numerical results.
In the section IV we conclude with the discussion of the
results.

II. THE MODEL

In our model we study a Newtonian ﬂuid ﬂowing in
a cylindrical tube, which mimics a natural pore, whose
walls are oscillating longitudinally and the ﬂuid is subject
to an oscillatory pressure gradient. We give analytical
solutions of the problem in the frequency domain.

The governing equation of the problem is the linearized

momentum equation of an incompressive ﬂuid

Here, ~v, p, ρ denote velocity, pressure and mass density
of the ﬂuid, while µ is the viscosity coeﬃcient.

Now, let u be a velocity of the wall of the tube which
oscillates in time as e−iωt. The ﬂow of ﬂuid in a cylin-
drical tube with longitudinally oscillating walls can be
described by a singe component of the velocity, namely,
its z-component vz (z axis is along the centerline of the
tube). We use cylindrical coordinate system (r, φ, z) in
treatment of the problem. We introduce the relative ve-
locity U1 as U1 = vz −
u. Thus, assuming that all physical
quantities vary in time as e−iωt, we arrive at the following
master equation for U1

Note, that F (κ) measures the deviation from Poiseuille
ﬂow friction as a function of frequency parameter κ. The
Biot’s expression for F (κ) in the no boundary slip regime
can be easily recovered from Eq.(7) by putting ξ

0.

In Fig. 1. we plot both Fr(κ) = Re[F (κ)] and Fi(κ) =
Im[F (κ)] for the three cases: when there is no bound-
−
ary slip (ξ = 0), and ξ = 0.05, 0.1, which means that in
the latter two cases the boundary slip velocity amounts
to 5 and 10 % of the cross-section averaged velocity in the
case of no slip, ¯U N S
. We gather from the plot that the
ξ = 0 is identical to Fig. 4 from Ref.[6] as it should be.
However, we also notice a considerable diﬀerence from
the classic case when ξ is non-zero.
In the latter case
Fr(κ) rises more sharply than in the no boundary slip

case, while Fi(κ) levels oﬀ and tends to negative values.
This diﬀerence can be attributed to the introduction of
non-zero boundary slip and mathematically it is mani-
factors in the

Eq.(7). We further investigate asymptotic behavior of
(cid:0)
. The ratio J1(κ√i)/J0(κ√i) tends to

This result has profound impact on all of the predic-
tions of the Biot’s theory. Namely, all observable quanti-
ties predicted by the Biot’s theory, such as phase veloc-
ities and attenuation coeﬃcients of the both rotational
and dilatational waves will be drastically aﬀected by the
introduction of boundary slip into the model.

Biot [6] showed that the general equations which
govern propagation of rotational and dilatational high-
frequency waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous medium are
the same as in the low-frequency range provided the vis-
cosity is replaced by its eﬀective value as a function of
frequency. In practice, it means replacing the resistance
coeﬃcient b by bF (κ).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In order to investigate the novelties brought about into
classical Biot’s theory of propagation of elastic waves in
porous medium [6] by the inclusion of boundary slip, we
have studied the full parameter space of the problem.

In all forthcoming results, we calculate phase velocities
and attenuation coeﬃcients for the case 1 from Table I
taken from Ref.
[6], which is σ11 = 0.610, σ22 = 0.305,
σ12 = 0.043, γ11 = 0.500, γ22 = 0.500, γ12 = 0, z1 =
0.812, and z2 = 1.674.

We calculated normalized phase velocity of the plane
rotational waves, vr/Vr, and the attenuation coeﬃcient
Lr/xa using our more general expression for F (κ) (which
takes into account non-zero boundary slip) given by
Eq.(7).

In Fig. 2 we plot phase velocity vr/Vr as a function of
frequency for the three cases: the solid curve corresponds
to ξ = 0 (no boundary slip), while long-dashed and short-
dashed curves correspond to ξ = 0.05 and ξ = 0.1 respec-
tively, i.e. when the boundary slip velocity amounts to
5 and 10 % of the cross-section averaged velocity in the
case of no slip, ¯U N S
. Note that the ξ = 0 case per-
fectly reproduces the curve 1 in Fig. 5 from Ref.[6]. For

1

4

ξ = 0.05 and 0.1 we notice a deviation from the classic
behavior in the form of overall increase of phase velocity.
Fig. 3 shows the attenuation coeﬃcient Lr/xa of the ro-
tational wave as a function of frequency for the three val-
ues of ξ: the solid curve corresponds to ξ = 0 (no bound-
ary slip), while long-dashed and short-dashed curves rep-
resent the cases ξ = 0.05 and ξ = 0.1 respectively. Note
that ξ = 0 case coincides with curve 1 in Fig. 6 from
Ref.[6]. Likewise to the behavior of vr/Vr we observe
that with the increase of the boundary slip velocity the
attenuation coeﬃcient of the rotational waves grows more
rapidly than in the classic no-slip case.

We also calculated normalized phase velocities of the
plane dilatational waves, vI /Vc and vII /Vc, and the at-
tenuation coeﬃcients Lc/xI and Lc/xII using our more
general expression for F (κ) given by Eq. (7).

In Figs. 4 and 5 are similar to Fig. 2 except that now
we plot phase velocities vI /Vc and vII /Vc as a function of
frequency. Note that the solid curves on the both graphs
reproduce curves 1 in Figs. 11 and 12 from Ref. [6]. We
gather from the graph that introduction of the non-zero
boundary slip leads to overall decrease of vI /Vc, while
vII /Vc attains progressively higher values than in the no
boundary slip case as ξ increases.

In Figs. 6 and 7 we plot the attenuation coeﬃcients
Lc/xI and Lc/xII in a similar manner as in Fig. 3. Again
we observe that the ξ = 0 case reproduces curves 1 in
Figs. 13 and 14 from Ref.[6]. We gather from Figs. 6
and 7 that introduction of the non-zero boundary slip
yields progressively larger than in the no boundary slip
case values of the attenuation coeﬃcients for both types
of the dilatational waves.

It is worthwhile to investigate asymptotic behavior of
limit. Using Eqs.(9)

the elastic waves in the f /fc → ∞
and (10) we observe that

As concerns the asymptotic behavior of the dilatational
waves, no mathematically simple expressions are readily
obtainable since in the case of non-zero boundary slip
the quantity M which enters Eq.(22) is no longer a small
parameter as in the case of Ref.[6].

IV. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have studied the eﬀect of introduc-
tion of the boundary slip in the theory of propagation of
elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid originally
formulated by Biot [6]. Biot’s theory ignores boundary
slip eﬀect, however, the boundary slip becomes impor-
tant when the length scale over which the ﬂuid velocity
changes approaches the slip length, i.e. when the ﬂuid is
highly conﬁned, for instance, ﬂuid ﬂow through porous
rock or blood vessel capillaries.
In the light of recent
convincing experimental evidence of a boundary slip in a
Newtonian liquid [1], it is necessary to take into account
this eﬀect into the Biot’s theory. We have studied the
eﬀect of introduction of boundary slip upon the func-
tion F (κ) that measures the deviation from Poiseuille
ﬂow friction as a function of frequency parameter κ.
This function crucially enters Biot’s equations which de-
scribe dynamics of ﬂuid-saturated porous solid. There-
fore, thorough revision of Biot’s theory is needed in order
to incorporate boundary slip eﬀect into the all measur-
able predictions of this theory such as phase velocities

and attenuation coeﬃcients of the both rotational and
dilatational waves. We have performed such analysis,
and in summary, we found that the introduction of the
non-zero boundary slip into the Biot’s theory of propaga-
tion of the elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid
results in

the overall increase, as compared to the no-slip lim-
iting case, of the phase velocities of both rotational
waves (vr/Vr) and dilatational wave of the second
kind (vII /Vc). On contrary, the phase velocity of
the dilatational wave of the ﬁrst kind (vI /Vc) expe-
riences overall decrease as compared to the no-slip
limiting case.

the attenuation coeﬃcients of both the rotational
(Lr/xa) and dilatational waves (Lc/xI and Lc/xII )
are increased as compared to the no-slip limiting
case as the boundary slip increases.

behavior of all physical quantities which describe
the elastic waves in the asymptotic limit of large
frequencies is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the intro-
duction of the non-zero boundary slip.

The investigation of properties of elastic waves is im-
portant for a number of applications. The knowledge
of phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients of elas-
tic waves is necessary, for example, to guide the oil-ﬁeld
exploration applications, acoustic stimulation of oil pro-
ducing ﬁelds (in order to increase the amount of recovered
residual oil), and the acoustic clean up of contaminated
aquifers [2, 3, 4, 5]. Therefore, our results would be use-
ful for various applications in oil production as well as in
ecology.

Figure Captions
Fig. 1: Behavior of Fr(κ) (thick curves) Fi(κ) (thin
curves) as function of frequency parameter, κ, according
to Eq.(7). Solid curves correspond to the case when ξ = 0
(no boundary slip), while long-dashed and short-dashed
curves correspond to ξ = 0.05 and ξ = 0.1 respectively,
i.e. when the boundary slip velocity amounts to 5 and
10 % of the cross-section averaged velocity in the case of
no slip, ¯U N S

.

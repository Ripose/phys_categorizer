Abstract. The physics of earthquake triggering together with simple assumptions of
self-similarity impose the existence of a minimum magnitude m0 below which earthquakes
do not trigger other earthquakes. Noting that the magnitude md of completeness of seis-
mic catalogs has no reason to be the same as the magnitude m0 of the smallest trigger-
ing earthquake, we use quantitative ﬁts and maximum likelihood inversions of observed
aftershock sequences as well as B˚ath’s law, compare with ETAS model predictions and
thereby constrain the value of m0. We show that the branching ratio n (average num-
ber of triggered earthquake per earthquake also equal to the fraction of aftershocks in
seismic catalogs) is the key parameter controlling the minimum triggering magnitude m0.
Conversely, physical upper bounds for m0 derived from state- and velocity-weakening fric-
tion indicate that at least 60 to 70 percent of all earthquakes are aftershocks.

1. Introduction

Scale invariance in earthquake phenomena is widely man-
ifested empirically, in the magnitude-frequency Gutenberg-
Richter relation, in the aftershock Omori decay rate, and
in many other relationships. Scale-invariance means that
there are no prefered length scales in seismogenic processes
and in spatio-temporal structures. However, there are many
reports that purport to identify characteristic scales. As
emphasized by Matsu’ura [1999], Aki [2000], and Sornette
[2002], the search for characteristic structures in speciﬁc
fault zones could allow the separation of large earthquakes
from small ones and thus advance earthquake prediction.

Although there is clear evidence of deviations from self-
similarity at large scales [Kagan, 1999; Pisarenko and Sor-
nette, 2003], the issue is much murkier at small scales.
For instance, Iio [1991], reports a lower magnitude cutoﬀ
mmin ≈ −1.4 for very small aftershocks of the 1984 West-
ern Nagano Prefecture, Japan, earthquake (mJMA = 6.8)
in spite of the fact that the high sensitivity of the obser-
vation system (focal distances less than 1 km and very low
ground noise) would have permitted to detect much smaller
magnitudes. Based on induced seismicity associated with
deep gold mines, Richardson and Jordan [1985] ﬁnd a lower
magnitude cutoﬀ mmin ≈ 0 for friction-dominated earth-
quakes, while fracture-dominated earthquakes have no lower
cutoﬀ but an upper cut-oﬀ of magnitude ≈ 1. Using deep
borehole recordings, Abercrombie [1995a; 1995b] found that
small earthquakes exist down to at least magnitude 0 and
that source scaling relationships hold down to at least −1.
Based on seismic power spectra, on the evidence of a low-
velocity low-Q zone reaching the top of the ductile part of
the crust and on seismic guided waves in fault zones, Li et
al.
[1994] argue for a characteristic earthquake magnitude

of about 3 associated with the width of fault zones. Another
characteristic magnitude in the range 4 − 5 is proposed by
−1
Aki [1996], based on the simultaneous change of coda Q
and the fractional rate of occurrence of earthquakes in this
magnitude interval. The existence of a discrete hierarchy
of scales has in addition been suggested by Sornette and
Sammis [1995] based on the analysis of accelerated seismic-
ity prior to large earthquakes and recently by Pisarenko et
al. [2004] by using a non-parametric measure of deviations
from power laws applied to the magnitude-frequency distri-
butions of earthquakes in subduction zones. Evidence of a
hierarchy of scales is also found in fragmentation and rup-
ture processes [Sadovskii, 1999; Geilikman and Pisarenko,
1989; Sahimi and Arbabi, 1996; Ouillon et al., 1996; Johan-
son and Sornette, 1998; Suteanu, 2000].

From a theoretical point of view, the equation of motion
for a continuum solid is scale-independent, suggesting that
deformation processes in solids should produce self-similar
patterns manifested in power law statistics. However, the
symmetry of the equation does not warrant that the solu-
tions of this equation share the same symmetry. Actually,
the diﬀerence (when it exists) in the symmetry between a
solution and its governing equation is known as the phe-
nomenon of “spontaneous symmetry breaking” [Consoli and
Stevenson, 2000] underlying a large variety of systems (for
instance explaining the non-zero masses of fundamental par-
ticles [Englert, 2004]). Of course, length scales associated
with rheology and existing structures can produce deviations
from exact self-similarity. For instance, a transition from
stable creep to a dynamic instability at a nucleation size
whose dimensions depend on frictional and elastic param-
eters deﬁnes a minimum earthquake size [Dieterich, 1992],
estimated at magnitude ≈ −3 by Ben-Zion [2003]. This min-
imum size corresponds only to events triggered according to
the mechanism of unstable sliding controlled by slip weak-
ening and thus concerns friction-dominated earthquakes.

A diﬀerent perspective is oﬀered by models of trig-
gered seismicity in which earthquakes (so-called foreshocks
and mainshocks) trigger other earthquakes (so-called main-
shocks and aftershocks, respectively). Recent studies sug-
gest that maybe more than 2/3 of events are triggered by

X - 2

previous earthquakes (see Helmstetter and Sornette [2003b]
and references therein). In this context, the relevant ques-
tion is no more how small is the smallest earthquake but
how small is the smallest earthquake which can trigger other
earthquakes (and, in particular, larger earthquakes).

2. The ETAS model and the smallest
triggering earthquake

To make this discussion precise,

let us consider the
epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, in which
any earthquake may trigger other earthquakes, which in turn
may trigger more, and so on. Introduced in slightly diﬀerent
forms by Kagan and Knopoﬀ [1981] and Ogata [1988], the
model describes statistically the spatio-temporal clustering
of seismicity.

The ETAS model consists of three assumed laws about
the nature of seismicity viewed as a marked point-process.
We restrict this study to the temporal domain only, sum-
ming over the whole spatial domain of interest. First, the
magnitude of any earthquake, regardless of time, space or
magnitude of the mother shock, is drawn randomly from
the exponential Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law. Its normal-
ized probability density function (pdf) is expressed as

P (m) =

b ln(10)10

−bm

10−bm0 − 10−bmmax

, m0 ≤ m ≤ mmax,

(1)

where the exponent b is typically close to one, and the cut-
oﬀs m0 (see below) and mmax serve to normalize the pdf.
The upper cut-oﬀ mmax is introduced to avoid unphysical,
inﬁnitely large earthquakes. Its value was estimated to be
in the range 8 − 9.5 [Kagan, 1999]. As the impact of a ﬁ-
nite mmax is quite weak in the calculations below, replacing
the abrupt cut-oﬀ mmax by a smooth taper would introduce
negligible corrections to our results.

Second, the model assumes that direct aftershocks are dis-
tributed in time according to the modiﬁed “direct” Omori
law (see Utsu et al. [1995] and references therein). Assuming
θ > 0, the normalized pdf of the Omori law can be written
as

Ψ(t) =

θcθ
(t + c)1+θ .

(2)

Third, the number of direct aftershocks of an event of

magnitude m is assumed to follow the productivity law:

ρ(m) = k10α(m−m0 ), m0 ≤ m ≤ mmax.

(3)

Note that the productivity law (3) is zero below the cut-
oﬀ m0, i.e.
earthquakes smaller than m0 do not trigger
other earthquakes, as is typically assumed in studies using
the ETAS model. The existence of the small-magnitude cut-
oﬀ m0 is necessary to ensure the convergence of the models
of triggered seismicity (in statistical physics of phase transi-
tions and in particle physics, this is called an “ultra-violet”
cut-oﬀ which is often necessary to make the theory con-
vergent). Below, we show that there are observable conse-
quences of the existence of the cut-oﬀ m0 thus providing
constraints on its physical value.

The key parameter of the model is deﬁned as the num-
ber n of direct aftershocks per earthquake, averaged over
all magnitudes. Here, we must distinguish between the two
cases α = b and α 6= b:

n ≡

P (m)ρ(m)dm

mmax

Zm0

Three regimes can be distinguished based on the value of
n. The case n < 1 corresponds to the subcritical regime,
where aftershock sequences die out with probability one.
The case n > 1 describes unbounded, explosive seismic-
ity that may lead to ﬁnite time singularities [Sornette and
Helmstetter, 2002]. The critical case n = 1 separates the
two regimes.

The fact that we use the same cut-oﬀ for the productiv-
ity cut-oﬀ and the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) cut-oﬀ is not
a restriction as long as the real cut-oﬀ for the Gutenberg-
Richter law is smaller than or equal to the cut-oﬀ for the
productivity law.
In that case, truncating the GR law at
the productivity cut-oﬀ just means that all smaller earth-
quakes, which do not trigger any events, do not participate
in the cascade of triggered events. This should not be con-
fused with the standard incorrect procedure in many pre-
vious studies of triggered seismicity of simply replacing the
GR and productivity cut-oﬀ m0 with the detection threshold
md in equations (1) and (3) (see, for example, Ogata [1988];
Zhuang et al. [2004]; Helmstetter and Sornette [2002]; Con-
sole et al. [2003]; Ogata [1998]; Felzer et al. [2002]; Kagan
[1991]). This may lead to a bias in the estimated parame-
ters.

The realization that the detection threshold md and the
triggering threshold m0 are diﬀerent leads to the question
of whether we can extract the size of the smallest triggering
earthquake. Here, we infer useful information on m0 from
the physics of earthquake triggering embodied in the sim-
ple ETAS formalism, from B˚ath’s law and from available
catalogs.

There is no loss of generality in considering one (inde-
pendent) branch (sequence or cascade of aftershocks) of the
ETAS model. Let an independent background event of mag-
nitude M1 occur at some origin of time. The mainshock will
trigger direct aftershocks according to the productivity law
(3). Each of the direct aftershocks will trigger their own
aftershocks, which in turn produce their own, and so on.
Averaged over all magnitudes, each aftershock produces n
direct oﬀspring according to (4). Thus, in inﬁnite time, we
can write the average of the total number Ntotal of direct
and indirect aftershocks of the initial mainshock as an in-
ﬁnite sum over terms of (3) multiplied by n to the power
of the generation [Helmstetter et al., 2004], which can be
expressed for n < 1 as:

Ntotal = ρ(M1) + ρ(M1)n + ρ(M1)n2 + ...

=

k10α(M1−m0)
1 − n

(5)

However, since we can only detect events above the de-
tection threshold md, the total number of observed after-
shocks Nobs of the sequence is simply Ntotal multiplied by
the fraction of events above the detection threshold, given
by (10−b(mmax −md) − 1)(10−b(mmax −md) − 1)−1 according to
the GR distribution. The observed number of events in the
sequence is therefore

M1 > md. To estimate m0, we need to eliminate or ﬁnd
estimates of the three unknowns n, k, and Nobs. We can
eliminate k through the expression (4) for n, leaving n and
Nobs. The mean number of observed aftershocks as a func-
tion of mainshock magnitude M1 was estimated by Helm-
stetter et al.
[2003] and can also
be obtained from B˚ath’s law. In the following sections, we
use these three estimates for Nobs and thus obtain m0 as a
function of the only remaining unknown n. Acknowledging
the controversy surrounding the estimation of the percent-
age of aftershocks in a catalog, we nevertheless use existing
estimates of n to ﬁnally obtain quantitative values for m0.

[2004] and Felzer et al.

3. Constraint on the smallest triggering
earthquake from the ETAS model and
observed estimates of aftershock numbers

Following the recipe outlined above, we begin by using
the estimates of the observed number of aftershocks Nobs
obtained by Helmstetter et al. [2004] in order to ﬁnd m0 as
a function of n. Helmstetter et al.
[2004] sidestepped the
problems associated with maximum likelihood estimates of
the complete model parameters by ﬁtting stacked observed
aftershock rates within pre-deﬁned space-time windows us-
ing the formula

λf it(t) =

Kf it10αM1−bmd
tpf it

,

(7)

based on scaling laws (the GR law, the Omori law, and
the productivity law) discussed above. The constant Kf it
includes all aftershocks, direct and indirect, and thus cor-
responds to a global renormalized constant diﬀerent from
k in the ETAS productivity law (3). Furthermore, pf it is
also a global exponent, which may be diﬀerent from the lo-
cal exponent 1 + θ of the ETAS model for n close to 1 and
at not too long times, as explained in Sornette and Sor-
nette [1999] and Helmstetter and Sornette [2002]. The total
number of aftershocks is then obtained by integrating over
an un-normalized Omori law according to Helmstetter et al.
[2004]:

Nf it(T, M1) =

λf it(t)dt

T

Zc

= Kf it10αM1−bmd T 1−pf it − c1−pf it

.

(8)

1 − pf it

For pf it < 1, this expression diverges as T increases to in-
ﬁnity. But, as it has been shown that the exponent of the
observed, global Omori law converges to a value 1 + θ > 1
at large times for n < 1 [Sornette and Sornette, 1999; Helm-
stetter and Sornette, 2002], the time factor converges also to
(θcθ)−1. Under the assumption that pf it = 1 + θ > 1, valid
for n not very close to the critical value 1, equation (8) may
then be rewritten as

Nf it(M1) = Kf it10αM1 −bmd (θcθ)

−1.

(9)

Equating the ETAS model prediction Nobs(M1) given by (6)
with the empirical estimate Nﬁt(M1) given by (9), and elim-
inating the unknown k through the expression for n in (4)
leads to an equation for m0 as a function of n:

, , (12)

for α = b. Expression (11) shows that, provided an esti-
mate of the branching ratio n is available, we can deduce
m0, since the other quantities can be measured indepen-
dently: b is close to 1, α is usually between 0.5 and 1, md
depends on catalogs but is often about 3, c is typically close
to 0.001 days and Kf it given by (7) is obtained from the
calibration of the productivity of earthquakes as a function
of their magnitude. In Table 1 of their study, Helmstetter
et al. [2004] report values for Kf it in the range from 0.005
to 0.02 (days)p−1, 0.94 ≤ α ≤ 1.05, b ≈ 0.95, md = [2, 3, 4],
c = 0.001 days and θ = 0.1.

We note that md appears in the expression (11) for m0.
Clearly, a detection threshold that evolves with seismic tech-
nology should not inﬂuence the physics of triggering. We
thus expect m0 to be independent of md. The reason md
does appear in the expression can be traced to the GR law
(1), which is normalized over the magnitude interval from
m0 to mmax. When integrated to give the probability of m
lying in the range from md to mmax, the factor involving md
does not enter as simply as in the formulation (7) of Helm-
stetter et al. [2004]. Therefore the factors do not cancel out
when comparing the ETAS prediction with the assumed pa-
rameterization of Helmstetter et al. [2004] and md remains
in the equations. Assuming that the GR law is correctly nor-
malized in the present ETAS model, this implies a (weak)
dependence of Kf it on md. Given the correlation between
α and Kf it (see below), the estimates of α may thus also
depend on md.

The estimate of m0 that we are trying to obtain relies on
the adequacy of the model used here and on the stability and
reliability of the quoted parameters. For now, we sidestep
any possible diﬃculties in the determination of the param-
eters and present in Figure 1 the magnitude of the small-
est triggering earthquake m0 as a function of the average
number n of direct aftershocks per mainshock for a range of
parameters. For n = 0, m0 equals the largest possible earth-
quake mmax, representing the limit that earthquakes do not
trigger any aftershocks. At the other end, for n = 1, the
formula predicts that m0 diverges to minus inﬁnity. Recall
that n = 1 corresponds to the system being exactly at the
critical value of a branching process and the statistical aver-
age Nobs(m) of the total number of events triggered over all
generations by a mother event of magnitude m becomes in-
ﬁnite. Of course, individual sequences have a ﬁnite lifetime
and a ﬁnite progeny with probability one and the theoret-
ical average loses its meaning due to the fat-tailed nature
of the corresponding distribution [Athreya, 1972; Saichev et
al., 2004; Saichev and Sornette, 2004]. Therefore, the pre-
diction on m0 becomes unreliable for n close to 1.

For a wide range of n and combinations between α and
Kf it, the magnitude of the smallest triggering earthquake
lies between 0 and −10. Only for values of n above 0.9 does
the size of m0 become smaller than −10. For reference, a
magnitude −10 event corresponds to a fault of length 1mm,
i.e. to a typical grain size.

Given that we expect m0 to be smaller than the detec-
tion threshold md, the horizontal line at md = 3 serves as
a (very) conservative estimate of the upper limit of m0 and
thus provides constraints on the combination of parameters
α, Kf it and n. For example, for α = 0.5 and Kf it = 0.0702,
at least 10 percent of all earthquakes must be aftershocks.
This lower limit increases drastically to about 70 percent for
α = b = 1 and Kf it = 0.0095.

SORNETTE AND WERNER: CONSTRAINTS ON THE SMALLEST TRIGGERING EARTHQUAKE

We can obtain another external bound on m0 from es-
timates of the minimum slip required before static friction
drops to kinetic friction and unstable sliding begins, accord-
ing to models of velocity-weakening friction. For example,
the parameter Dc in rate and state dependent friction [Di-
eterich, 1992; Dieterich, 1994] was estimated at 0.5 m from
seismograms [Ide and Takeo, 1997] and similarly at 40 − 90
cm from slip-velocity records [Mikumo et al., 2003], although
both probably correspond to upper bounds. Estimates of Dc
from laboratory friction experiments are approximately 5 or-
ders of magnitude less than the upper bound determined by
seismic studies. One could conclude that either the upper
bound from seismic studies is so extreme as to render the
comparison to laboratory studies meaningless, or the slip
weakening process is in fact diﬀerent at laboratory scales
[Kanamori and Brodsky, 2004]. If we assume that the mini-
mum slip needed to initiate stable sliding corresponds to the
minimum length of a friction-based earthquake, then, ne-
glecting fracture-based earthquakes, Dc corresponds to the
size of the smallest earthquake. Given that the smallest
triggering earthquake must be equal to or larger than the
smallest earthquake, but that the estimates of Dc are upper
limits, we use these values for Dc as an upper limit of the
smallest triggering earthquake. From the relations between
fault length, moment and moment magnitude [Kanamori
and Brodsky, 2004] with Dc = 1 m and a stress drop of 3
MPa, we obtain an upper limit of magnitude −1.8 for the
smallest triggering earthquake. This upper limit is respre-
sented in Figure 1 as the lower horizontal line.

Felzer et al.

[2002] have used α = b on the basis of an
argument of self-similarity. Helmstetter et al.
[2004] also
argue for a value of α essentially undistinguishable from b
based on ﬁts of stacked aftershock decay rates in pre-deﬁned
space-time windows. Other studies have found α as small as
and even smaller than 0.5 (see, for example, Console et al.
[2003]; Helmstetter [2003]; Zhuang et al. [2004]). In view of
the lack of consensus and to keep the discussion independent
of the estimation problem, we use the correlation we found
between the parameters Kf it and α estimated in Helmstet-
ter et al. [2004] to extrapolate to smaller α. The existence
of such a correlation is standard in joint estimations of sev-
eral parameters and can be deduced from the inverse of the
Fisher matrix of the log-likelihood function Rao [1965]. Such
correlation can also be enhanced if the model is misspeci-
ﬁed. We performed a least-square ﬁt to the scatter plot (see
Figure 2) to obtain a relationship between the parameters
and then calculated an estimate of Kf it for smaller values
of α. The resulting curves are plotted in Figure 1.

Delaying the discussion on the estimation problem until
the end of the section, we use (11) together with existing
estimates of the percentage of aftershocks in seismic cata-
logs (equivalent to n [Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003b]) to
constrain m0. We note, however, that diﬀerent declustering
techniques lead to diﬀerent estimates. No consensus exists
on which method should be trusted most. For example,
Gardner and Knopoﬀ [1974] found that about 2/3 of the
events in the Southern California catalogue are aftershocks.
With another method, Reasenberg [1985] found that 48% of
the events belong to a seismic cluster. Davis and Frohlich
[1991] used the ISC catalog and, out of 47500 earthquakes,
found that 30% belong to a cluster, of which 76% are af-
tershocks and 24% are foreshocks. Recently, using diﬀerent
versions of the ETAS model, Zhuang et al. [2004] have per-
formed a careful inversion of the JMA catalog for Japan
using a magnitude md = 4.2 for the completeness of their
catalog. They provide three estimates of the branching ratio
for their best model: n = 0.42, 0.55, and 0.46.

Whether any of these methods estimate n correctly
and without bias remains questionable. In particular, the
branching ratios as calculated by Zhuang et al. [2004] and
others may be signiﬁcantly biased by the assumption that

md = m0, which can be shown to lead to an apparent
branching ratio modiﬁed by the impact of hidden seismic-
ity below the catalog completeness [Sornette and Werner,
2004]. Moreover, there are problems with the maximum like-
lihood estimation (see for instance Helmstetter et al. [2004]).
However, in the absence of better estimations, we neverthe-
less use the above values as rough estimates of n. Given the
range of α and Kf it, m0 is still not very well constrained for
one particular value of n (see Figure 1). For example, for
50 percent aftershocks (n = 0.5), m0 ranges from 1 to an
unrealistic 7 depending on the values of α and Kf it. This
argument could be used to rule out the combination n = 0.5
and α = 1. In fact, for m0 to be smaller than md = 3, at
least 70 percent of earthquakes are aftershocks. For m0 to
be smaller than the upper limit estimated from Dc, at least
80 percent must be aftershocks.

We can also use the values obtained by Felzer et al. [2003]
to constrain m0. The authors also used ﬁnite space-time
windows in which they ﬁtted aftershock sequences with pa-
rameters for a global sequence according to

CT =

AT
1 − pT

((t + cT )1−pT − cT

1−pT ), pT 6= 1,

(13)

where t is the selected duration of the sequences, pT is the
global Omori exponent, cT is the Omori constant, and AT is
the productivity. Assuming that the local Omori exponent
is p = pT = 1 + θT , expression (13) can be rewritten for the
inﬁnite time limit as

CT =

AT
θT cT

.

θT

(14)

The obtained values are listed in Table 3 of their study:
AT = 0.116 days1−pT , pT = 1.08 and cT = 0.014 days.
These values hold for a typical California aftershock se-
quence of a magnitude M1 = 6.04 mainshock, a detection
threshold of md = 4.8, and α = b = 1.

As before, we equate the ETAS model prediction (6) with
the observation (14), eliminate k through expression (4) for
n (where α = b) and obtain an equation for m0 as a function
of n:

m0 = mmax −

n
1 − n

−b(mmax −md))
b ln(10)

×

θT cθT

10b(M1−md ), α = b = 1.

(15)

This expression for m0 is shown in Figure 3 (solid curve).
As in equation (11), md remains artifactually in the equa-
tion due to a dependence of AT on the detection threshold.
Since the parameters were obtained with α = b = 1, we do
not alter the values of α and obtain only one curve. For
comparison, we include the curve for the case α = b that we
obtained above in Figure 1, based on the ﬁts by Helmstet-
ter et al. [2004] (dashed curve) and the curve for the case
α = b that results from using B˚ath’s law (see next section)
(dotted). We observe the same characteristics as before in
that m0 approaches mmax for small n and that it diverges
to minus inﬁnity for n going to one. Diﬀerences between the
three curves arise only in the faster or slower decrease of m0
with n. For example, the (conservative) upper limit md = 3
for m0 constrains n to be larger than 60 percent according
to the values obtained by Felzer et al. [2003], whereas the
parameters of Helmstetter et al.
[2004] for the case α = b
impose n to be at least 70 percent. For the estimate ob-
tained from B˚ath’s law (see next section), n must be larger
than about 45 percent. If we assume that the upper limit
of m0 can be obtained from estimates of Dc, corresponding
to m = −1.8, then n must be at least 60 percent according

to the estimate from B˚ath’s law, 75 percent according to
Felzer et al. [2003], and 85 percent according to the ﬁt by
Helmstetter et al.
[2004]. Conversely, n = 0.7 determines
m0 roughly equal to zero, whereas n = 0.8 implies m0 lies
in the range −7 to −5.

Since the three expressions for m0 (for α = b) show the
same functional dependence on key variables and diﬀer only
in the diﬀerent estimates of a few constants, this consistency
provides some conﬁdence in our results. As for the diﬀerence
in the three curves, they constitute three diﬀerently formu-
lated, empirical estimates of the number of events of typical
aftershock sequences. Given the variability of the aftershock
process, the discrepancy in the estimates is to be expected.
We now point out diﬃculties for exploiting quantitatively
the above ideas. Our conclusions for m0 and n are based on
empirical parameter estimations that involve delicate tech-
nical problems. The constants Kobs deﬁned in (7) and AT
deﬁned in (14) are in principle measurable. Many issues
may bias the estimation of these parameters: (i) The total
number of aftershocks is estimated empirically in ﬁnite space
and time windows and events outside are thus missed. In
particular, in the special case where p, as deﬁned in (2), and
n are both close to 1, a substantial fraction of aftershocks
occurs at very long time and are very diﬃcult if not im-
possible to distinguish from the background seismicity. (ii)
Stacking diﬀerent sequences with diﬀerent global Omori law
decays may introduce errors.
(iii) The p exponent of the
Omori law may intrinsically depend on the mainshock mag-
nitude [Ouillon and Sornette, 2004]. (iv) Background events
may be falsely counted as aftershocks. (v) Magnitude and
location uncertainties may bias the parameters. (vi) Miss-
ing events in the catalog, especially after large events, may
artifactually change the parameter values. (vii) Undetected
seismicity may bias the estimated parameters [Sornette and
Werner, 2004].

4. Constraints on the smallest triggering
earthquake from Bath’s law

Finally, we use the empirical B˚ath’s law to constrain m0
as a function of n. The law states that the average diﬀerence
between a mainshock of magnitude M1 and the magnitude
ma of its largest aftershock is dm = M1 − ma = 1.2, regard-
less of the mainshock magnitude (see for example Helm-
stetter and Sornette, [2003a] and references therein). Let
Nobs be the total number of aftershocks generated by the
mainshock above the magnitude md of completeness of the
catalog. Assuming that the magnitudes of the aftershocks
are drawn from the Gutenberg-Richter law, the largest after-
shock has an average magnitude given by a simple argument
of extreme value theory:

ma = md + (1/b)(log10 Nobs).

(16)

Solving this expression for Nobs, equating it with the ETAS
prediction (6) and eliminating k through the expression for
n (4) provides an estimate of m0 as a function of n:

m0 =

1
(α − b) ln(10)

×

ln 10(α−b)mmax +

10αM1−bma (1 − 10

−b(mmax −md)),

for α 6= b and

m0 = mmax − (

n
1 − n

)

−b(mmax −md ))
b ln(10)

10b(M1 −ma),

(17)

(18)

for α = b.

Figure 4 illustrates the behaviour of m0 as a function
of the average number n of direct aftershocks for reason-
able values of the other constants (mmax = 8.5, md = 3,
b = 1, α = [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1] (light to dark)), for main-
shock and largest aftershock values according to M1 − ma =
7 − 5.8 = 1.2 from B˚ath’s law. Again, as n tends to one,
m0 tends to minus inﬁnity, while for n = 0, m0 = mmax, as
expected. We also observe that m0 is almost constant over
a wide range of n for comparatively small α, whereas m0
varies much faster for the case α = b.

As alluded to in the last section, we obtain the same func-
tional dependence as in both previous estimates of the last
section. However, for α = b, the decrease of m0 with in-
creasing n is even faster than when using the parameters
of Felzer et al.
[2003]. Here, the upper limit md = 3 for
m0 (upper horizontal line) constrains n to be larger than 45
percent, smaller than the 60 percent found previously. This
discrepancy is due to the three diﬀerent ways of estimating
the observed number of aftershocks. However, since all three
are in a similar range, they provide a test of the consistency
of the results.

When applying the Dc-derived upper limit of −1.8 (lower
horizontal line), n must be larger than at least 60 percent
for α = b and larger than 80 percent for α = 0.9. We thus
ﬁnd that for n = 0.5, m0 is in the range 2 to an unrealistic
5, while for n = 0.7, m0 lies between −10 and 5, depending
on the values of α. Since m0 ≥ 3 is unrealistic, the entire
region of combinations between α and n that fall above that
value can be ruled out. For example, the case α = 0.8 leads
to a reasonable m0 smaller than md = 3 only for n larger
than about 65 percent.

5. Conclusions

We have shown that diﬀerentiating between the smallest
triggering earthquake m0 and the detection threshold md
within the ETAS model leads, together with three separate
estimates of the observed numbers of aftershocks, to three
estimates of m0 as a function of the percentage n of after-
shocks in a catalog (also equal to the branching ratio). We
have used empirically ﬁtted values for aftershock numbers
and thereby eliminated one variable from the ETAS formal-
ism in order to obtain an estimate of m0 as a function of
n. The three diﬀerent estimates were obtained from the
ﬁts performed by Helmstetter et al. [2004], by Felzer et al.
[2003], and from the empirical B˚ath’s law (see Helmstetter
and Sornette [2003a] and references therein). All three give
the same functional dependence and similar values for m0.
In particular, we can place bounds on m0 from estimates of
the percentage of aftershocks in earthquake catalogs. Con-
versely, we can limit the range of n by observing that m0
must be less than the detection threshold md, or, less con-
servatively, that m0 must be less than the magnitude corre-
sponding to the rate-and-state critical slip Dc as estimated
from seismograms. Apart from quantitative values for m0,
the bounds limit the possible combinations between n and
α and, in particular, indicates that at least 60 to 70 percent
of all earthquakes are aftershocks.

The fact that the existence of a small magnitude cut-oﬀ
m0 for triggering should have observable consequences may
appear surprising. But such a phenomenon of the impact of
a small scale cut-oﬀ on “macroscopic” observables is not new
in physics and actually permeates particle physics, ﬁeld the-
ory and condensed matter physics. In the present case, the
existence of m0 has an observable impact especially when
α ≤ b for which the cumulative eﬀect of tiny earthquakes
dominate or equate that of large earthquakes with respect
to the physics of triggering other earthquakes [ Helmstetter,
2003; Helmstetter et al., 2004]. We hope that the present

X - 6

article, together with our companion paper Sornette and
Werner [2004], will draw the attention of the community to
the important problem of the distinction between md and
m0. Moreover, it will perhaps encourages re-analyses of in-
version methods of models of triggered seismicity, and in
particular of maximum likelihood estimations, to take into
account the bias due to the unobserved seismicity below the
magnitude of catalog completeness.

Abstract

We investigate an unusual class of medium-scale traveling ionospheric distur-

bances (MS TIDs) of the nonwave type, isolated ionospheric disturbances (IIDs)

that manifest themselves in total electron content (TEC) variations in the form

of single aperiodic negative TEC disturbances of a duration of about 10 min (the

total electron content spikes, TECS). For the ﬁrst time, we present the TECS

morphology for 170 days with a diﬀerent level of geomagnetic activity and with

the number of stations of the global GPS network ranging from 4 to 240. A

total number of the TEC series (radio paths) used in the analysis, correspond-

ing to the observation along a single receiver-satellite Line-of-Sight (LOS), with

a duration of each series of about 2.3 hours, exceeded 850000. The data were

obtained using the technology of global detection and monitoring of ionospheric

disturbances (GLOBDET, developed at the ISTP SB RAS) of a natural and

technogenic origin using measurements of TEC variations from a global network

of receivers of the GPS. It was found that TECS are observed in no more than

1-2% of the total number of radio paths. We present the results derived from

analyzing the dependence of TECS parameters on the local time, and on the

level of geomagnetic activity. The TECS amplitude exceeds at least one order of

magnitude the TEC ﬂuctuation intensity under ”background” conditions. The

IID-induced TEC variations are similar in their amplitude, form and duration

to the TEC response to shock-acoustic waves (SAW) generated during rocket

launchings and earthquakes. However, the IID propagation velocity is less than

the SAW velocity (800-1000 m/s) and are most likely to correspond to the ve-

locity of background medium-scale acoustic-gravity waves (AGW), on the order

of 100-200 m/s.

1 Introduction

Ionosphere (ionospheric irregularities, instruments and techniques), radio science (iono-

Of the known ionospheric irregularities of a diﬀerent class, mid-latitude isolated iono-

spheric disturbances (IIDs) stand out as a highly unusual type. The past 40 years saw a

consistent interest in the study of the origin of IIDs that was aroused due to diﬃculties

in determining an adequate mechanism for IID generation in mid-latitudes, as well as

by the fact that the IID have a marked eﬀect on amplitude and phase characteristics of

transionospheric signals from radio engineering communication and navigation systems

(Afraimovich et al., 1992) by causing serious malfunctions of these systems.

A large number of publications (e.g., Karasawa, 1985; Titheridge, 1971), including a

review by Bowman (1989) were devoted to the study along this line. IIDs are detected

when recording amplitude and phase scintillations of transionospheric radio signals in

the form of rarely occurring single aperiodic negative impulses with a duration from

a few to several tens of seconds (Karasawa, 1985). To name this uncommon type of

scintillation Karasawa (1985) seems to be the ﬁrst to coin the term ”spikes-type” (S-)

scintillations.

Karasawa et al. (1985) noticed from a long-term recording of the signal from the

geostationary MARISAT satellite at 1.5 GHz frequency that synchronous with ampli-

tude S-scintillations, there occur similar-appearing changes of the rotation angle of po-

larization plane that are proportional to a corresponding disturbance of total electron

content (TEC). Anomalous ﬂuctuations, recorded during 13 months of observation,

occur predominantly in the night-time and last from 5 s to 2 min. The diurnal depen-

dence of the S-type oscillations shows two distinct peaks: 09:00-15:00 in the daytime,

and 20:00-01:00 at night. As far as the seasonal dependence is concerned, however, a

maximum of the oscillation distribution corresponds to early summer (June). It is cus-

tomary to associate the occurrence of S-type oscillations with diﬀraction or interference

from small-scale irregularities, ”blobs” and ”bubbles”, generated in the ionosphere.

Titheridge (1971) found that amplitude and phase S-scintillations are caused by

refraction and diﬀraction eﬀects at the propagation of the transionospheric signal in a

medium with IIDs and presented the corresponding formulae for estimating these eﬀects

as a function of relationship of the wavelength of the radio wave, the irregularity size

and the sounding geometry (LOS to the satellite and the distance to the layer with

IIDs).

However, in spite of the many years of experimental and theoretical investigations,

there is as yet no clear understanding not only of the physical nature of IIDs but even

of their morphology (the occurrence frequency as a function of geographical position,

time, level of geomagnetic and meteorological activity, etc.).

To tackle these questions requires statistically signiﬁcant sets of experimental data

with good spatial and temporal resolution in order to gain insight into not only mor-

phological but also dynamic IID characteristics: the direction of travel, the propaga-

tion velocity, and the location of the possible disturbance source. Another important

requirement implies a continuity and global coverage of observations since such phe-

nomena are relatively rare in time and random in space.

Such an opportunity is for the ﬁrst time provided by the use of the international

ground-based network of two-frequency receivers of the GPS, consisting of no less

than 1000 sites as of the beginning of 2002 and posting its data on the Internet,

which open up new avenues for a global, continuous, fully computerized monitoring of

ionospheric disturbances of a diﬀerent class. Analysis and detection of IIDs was made

possible through the use of the technology for global detection and determination of

parameters of ionospheric disturbances of a diﬀerent class that was developed at the

ISTP (Afraimovich, 2000b).

The objective of this paper is to study the morphology and spatial and temporal

properties of IIDs using data from a global network of GPS receivers. Following Kara-

sawa et al. (1985), the term TECS (total electron content spikes) will be used here to

designate the IID-induced TEC disturbances. The sample statistic of the occurrence

frequency and morphology used in this study does refer to TECS recorded from GPS

data. Within the framework of certain model representations, using these data it is

possible to reconstruct amplitude and spatial characteristics of local electron density

disturbances, i.e. of IIDs themselves. On this basis, the term IIDs will be used below

interchangeably with the term TECS.

Section 2 describes the method for detecting the TECS obtained in our study.

Section 3 presents the TECS morphology. Section 4 is devoted to a detailed analysis

of the spatial and temporal properties of IIDs by considering the most pronounced

manifestation of TECS on October 5, 2001 in California, USA. The discussion of results

compared with ﬁndings reported by other authors is presented in Section 5.

Our comparison of IID characteristics with geomagnetic ﬁeld variations used data

from near-lying magnetic variation stations of the INTERMAGNET network (address:

http://www.intermagnet.org).

2 Method of processing the data from the global

network. Selection of TECS

The standart GPS technology provides a means for wave disturbances detecion based on

phase measurements of TEC at each of spaced two-frequency GPS receivers (Hofmann-

Wellenhof et. al, 1992):

Io =

[(L1λ1 − L2λ2) + const + nL],

(1)

where L1λ1 and L2λ2 are additional paths of the radio signal caused by the phase

delay in the ionosphere, (m); L1 and L2 represent the number of phase rotations at the

frequencies f1 and f2; λ1 and λ2 stand for the corresponding wavelengths, (m); const is

the unknown initial phase ambiguity, (m); and nL are errors in determining the phase

path, (m).

Phase measurements in the GPS can be made with a high degree of accuracy cor-
responding to the error of TEC determination of at least 1014 m−2 when averaged on

a 30-second time interval, with some uncertainty of the initial value of TEC, however

(Hofmann-Wellenhof et. al, 1992). This makes possible detecting ionization irregulari-
ties and wave processes in the ionosphere over a wide range of amplitudes (up to 10−4

of the diurnal TEC variation) and periods (from 24 hours to 5 min). The unit of TEC
T ECU, which is equal to 1016 m−2 and is commonly accepted in the literature, will

be used in the following.

Primary data include series of ”oblique” values of TEC I0(t), as well as the cor-

responding series of elevations θs(t) and azimuths αs(t) of the LOS to the satellite

calculated using our developed CONVTEC program which converts the GPS system

standard RINEX-ﬁles on the INTERNET (Gurtner, 1993).

Series of the values of elevations θs(t) and azimuths αs(t) of the LOS to the satellite

were used to determine the coordinates of subionospheric points, and to convert the

”oblique” TEC I0(t) to the corresponding value of the ”vertical” TEC by employing

the technique reported by Klobuchar (1986)

I = I0 × cos

(2)

where Rz is the Earth’s radius, and hmax=300 km is the height of the F2-layer
maximum. All results in this study were obtained for elevations θs(t) larger than 30◦.

The technology of global detection of TEC disturbances that was developed at the

ISTP SB RAS makes it possible to select - in the automatic mode from an extensive

amount of experimental material - TEC disturbances which can be classed as TECS.

TECS were selected by two criteria. TEC variations were selected ﬁrst, the standard

deviation (rms) of which exceeded the prescribed level ǫ. The statistic of TECS dis-

cussed in this paper was obtained for ǫ = 0.1 T ECU. Then, for each ﬁltered series we

veriﬁed the fulﬁlment of the ”singleness” condition of the TEC overshoot.

Fig. 1 illustrates the TECS selection procedure. Fig. 1a presents an example of

weakly disturbed disturbances of a ”vertical” TEC I(t) recorded on February 11, 2001
at station COCO (96.8◦E; 12.1◦S; the satellite number is PRN30). Fig. 1b presents the

ﬁltered (from the initial I(t)-series) dI(t)-variations. Thin horizontal lines show the

prescribed threshold ǫ. The standard deviation of the dI(t)-variations is 0.007 T ECU,

that is, does not reach the prescribed threshold, ǫ = 0.1 T ECU.

Figs. 1d and 1e plot the same dependencies as in Figs. 1a and 1b, but for station
BAKO (106.8◦E; 06.5◦S; the satellite number is PRN26). It is evident from Fig. 1d that

unusual (for background disturbances) TEC variations in the form of a single impulse

of a duration on the order of ∆T =10 min are clearly identiﬁed at the background of

slow TEC variations.

The time tmin, corresponding to the value of Amin of the ﬁltered TEC variation

dI(t), is shown in Fig.1e by the shaded triangle. The value of ∆T is determined from the

level of 0.5 Amin. The amplitude of this pulse Amin far exceeds the speciﬁed threshold

ǫ and at least an order of magnitude higher than the background TEC ﬂuctuation

intensity for this range of periods (Afraimovich et al., 2001b).

The relative amplitude of such a response Amin/I0 has a signiﬁcant value, 2%. We

used, as the background value of I0, the absolute ”vertical” TEC value I0(t) for the
site located at 7.5◦S; 105◦E, obtained from IONEX-maps of TEC (Mannucci, 1998).

It should be noted that the above examples both refer to the same time interval and

to the stations spaced by a distance over 1300 km. This indicates a local character of

the phenomenon and is in agreement with the overall statistic characterizing its spatial

correlation (see Section 3).

For each of the events satisfying the above TECS selection criteria, a special ﬁle

was used to store information about the GPS station name and geographic latitude

and longitude; GPS satellite PRN number; amplitude Amin; time tmin corresponding

to the minimum value of the Amin amplitude; and about the TECS duration ∆T . The

sample statistic, presented below, was obtained by processing such ﬁles.

3 Morphology of TECS

A total number of the TEC series (radio paths) used in the analysis, corresponding to

the observation along a single receiver-satellite LOS, with a duration of each series of

about 2.3 hours, exceeded 850000. The method outlined above was used to obtain a

set of TECS totaling about 10000 cases, or making up about 1% of the total number

of the LOS’s. An analysis of the resulting statistic revealed a number of dependencies

of TECS parameters on diﬀerent factors.

First we consider the seasonal dependence of the TECS occurrence frequency and

amplitude (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a plots the number of days of observation M versus season.

As is evident, the autumn is represented best statistically. Fig.2b shows the seasonal

dependence of the number of TECS, N. Fig. 2c plots the number of TECS per day as

a function of season L = N/M. This dependence has maxima in spring and in autumn.

The relative density of TECS, D, obtained as the ratio of the number of TECS

identiﬁed, N, to the number of LOS’s, is presented in Fig. 2d.

Vertical lines in Fig. 2d show TECS standard deviations (rms). The dashed hori-

zontal line plots the threshold in amplitude ǫ = 0.1 T ECU. The most probable value

of < |Amin| > with a small scatter varies around the value 0.3 T ECU, independently

of the season.

Fig. 3a plots the dependence P (|Dst|) of the number of TECS on the modulus
of values of the geomagnetic activity index Dst. There is a general tendency of the

number of TECS to increase with the decreasing level of geomagnetic activity. Most
(80%) of TECS occur when values of the Dst-index are below 50 nT.

Fig. 3b presents the diurnal distribution of TECS, P (tmin), for the times tmin

corresponding to the minimum value of the amplitude Amin.

It is evident that the

distribution has maxima in the night-time and in the morning hours, approximately

from 00:00 to 07:00, and from 23:00 to 24:00 of local time LT.

Fig. 3d presents the normalized probability distribution P (|Amin|) of TECS occur-

rence with a given amplitude Amin. The vertical dashed line shows the threshold in

amplitude ǫ = 0.1 T ECU. It was found that the largest probable value of the am-

plitude |Amin|, also shown in Fig.3d, is about 0.3 T ECU, and the half-width of the

distribution is 0.2 T ECU. As demonstrated by Afraimovich et al. (2001a), the mean

values of the TEC variation amplitude with a period of 20 min for the magnetically

quiet and magnetically disturbed days do not exceed 0.01 T ECU and 0.07 T ECU, re-

spectively. Thus the most probable value of the amplitude Amin of the TECS identiﬁed

here exceeds the mean values of the TEC phase variation amplitude by a factor of 4-5

as a minimum.

The availability of a large number of stations in some regions on the globe, for

instance, in California, USA, and West Europe, furnishes an opportunity to determine

not only the temporal but also spatial characteristics of TECS. In order to estimate the

radius of spatial correlation of events of this type, the number of cases was calculated

where TECS within a single 2.3-hour time interval were observed at any two GPS

stations spaced by a distance dR. Fig. 3c presents the histogram of the number of

such cases P (dR) as a function of distance dR. It was found that the localization of

TECS in space is sharply deﬁned. In 90% of cases the distance dR does not exceed

500 km.

4 Dynamics and anisotropy of IIDs as deduced

from the October 5, 2001 event over California,

USA

The event of October 5, 2001 was used in the analysis of the TECS dynamic character-

istics of TECS. On that day between 08:00 and 18:00 UT, a number of GPS stations
located in California, USA (220-260◦E; 28-42◦N) recorded a large number of traveling

ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) of the TECS type. For the above-mentioned time

interval and the selected longitude range, the local time varied from 00:00 to 10:00
LT (for the longitude of 240◦E corresponding to the center of the GPS station array

used in the analysis). So that the experimental conditions were characteristic for the

night-time ionosphere.

Fig. 4 illustrates the geometry of the experiment on October 5, 2001. Heavy

dots show the GPS stations, and small dots indicate the position of subionospheric

points for all LOS’s. Since several (at least four) GPS satellites are observed at each

receiving site simultaneously, the number of LOS’s far exceeds the number of stations,

which enhances considerably the possibilities of the analysis. Panel a presents the

entire set of GPS stations and subionospheric points that were used in the experiment

for the time interval from 8:00 to 10:00 UT. Panels b and c show the stations and

subionospheric points where the TEC variations revealed TECS with an amplitude

exceeding the speciﬁed threshold ǫ=0.01 T ECU (b), and ǫ=0.1 T ECU (c). Except

in a single case, TECS were recorded along the LOS running over land. As is evident

from the ﬁgure, the increase of the recording threshold did not change the number of

events recorded.

Fig. 5 presents the geomagnetic ﬁeld Dst-variations (a) for October 5, 2001. H(t)-

variations of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic ﬁeld as recorded at station
Victoria (48.52◦N; 236.58◦E) - b. dH(t)-variations of the horizontal component of the

geomagnetic ﬁeld, ﬁltered from the H(t)-series in the range of 2-20-min periods - c.

At the lower time scale in Fig. 5, the local time LT is represented for the longitude of
240◦E.

Fig. 5d presents the distribution of the values of the GPS station latitudes and

time tmin, corresponding to each of the TECS detected that day by all GPS stations of
the California region that were used in the analysis (220-260◦E; 28-42◦E). The letters

A, B, C, and D in Fig. 5d label the TECS ”traces” that are presented in Fig. 6 on a

smaller time scale (see Section 4.2). Fig. 5e - same as in Fig. 5d, but for the station

longitudes and tmin.

Fig. 5f presents the distribution N(t) of the number of TECS that were detected

that day at all GPS stations used in the analysis, with the rms above ǫ=0.1 T ECU.

4.1 Determining the dynamic characteristics of IIDs by the

SADM-GPS method

The methods of determining the form and dynamic characteristics of TIDs that are

used in this study are based on those reported in (Mercier, 1986; Afraimovich, 1997;

Afraimovich et al., 1998; 1999; 2000c).

We determine the velocity and direction of motion of the phase interference pattern

(phase front) in terms of some model of this pattern, an adequate choice of which

is of critical importance. In the simplest form, space-time variations in phase of the

transionospheric radio signal that are proportional to TEC variations dI(t, x, y) in the

ionosphere, at each given time t can be represented in terms of the phase interference

pattern that moves without a change in its shape (the non dispersive disturbances):

I(t, x, y) = F (t − x/ux − y/uy)

(3)

where ux(t) and uy(t) are the displacement velocities of intersection of the phase

front of the axes x (directed to the East) and y (directed to the North), respectively.

It should be noticed, however, that in real situations this ideal model (3) is not

realized in a pure form. This is because that the TIDs propagate in the atmosphere

in the form of a dispersing wave packet with a ﬁnite value of the width of the angular

spectrum. But in the ﬁrst approximation on short time interval of averaging compared

to time period of ﬁltered variations of TEC, the phase interference pattern moves

without a substantial change in its shape.

A Statistical, Angle-of-arrival and Doppler Method (SADM) was proposed by

Afraimovich (1997) for determining the characteristics of the dynamics of the phase in-

terference pattern in the horizontal plane by measuring variations of phase derivatives
with respect to the spatial coordinates I ′
x(t), I ′
t(t). This permits
the determination of the unambiguous orientation of α(t) of the wave-vector K in the
range 0–360◦ and the horizontal velocity V (t) at each speciﬁc instant of time.

y(t), and to the time I ′

Afraimovich et al. (1998, 1999, 2000c) described updating of the SADM algorithm

for GPS-arrays (SADM-GPS) based on a simple model for the displacement of the

phase interference pattern that travels without a change in the shape and on using

current information about the angular coordinates of the LOS: the elevation θs(t) and

the azimuth αs(t).

The method SADM-GPS makes it possible to determine the horizontal velocity

Vh(t) and the azimuth α(t) of TID displacement at each speciﬁc instant of time (the
wave-vector orientation K) in a ﬁxed coordinate system (x, y):

α(t) = arctan(uy(t)/ux(t))
t(t)/I ′
ux(t) = I ′
t(t)/I ′
uy(t) = I ′
u(t) = |ux(t)uy(t)|/(u2

x(t) = u(t)/ cos α(t)

y(t) = u(t)/ sin α(t)

x(t) + u2

y(t))−1/2

Vx(t) = u(t) sin α(t) + wx(t)

Vy(t) = u(t) cos α(t) + wy(t)
Vh(t) = (V 2

x (t) + V 2

y (t))1/2

(4)

where wx and wy are the x and y projections of the velocity w of the subionospheric

point (for taking into account the motion of the GPS satellite).

Let us take a brief look at the sequence of data handling procedures. Out of a

large number of GPS stations, three points (A, B, C) are chosen in such a way that

the distances between them do not exceed about one-half the expected wavelength

Λ of the disturbance. The point B is taken to be the center of a topocentric frame

of reference. Such a conﬁguration of the GPS receivers represents a GPS-array (or a

GPS-interferometer) with a minimum of the necessary number of elements. In regions

with a dense network of GPS-points, we can obtain a broad range of GPS-arrays of

a diﬀerent conﬁguration, which furnishing a means of testing the data obtained for

reliability; in this paper we have taken advantage of this possibility (Section 4.2).

The input data include series of the vertical TEC IA(t), IB(t), IC(t), as well as

corresponding series of values of the elevation θs(t) and the azimuth αs(t) of the LOS.

Series of θs(t) and αs(t) are used to determine the location of the subionospheric point,
as well as to calculate the elevation θ of the wave vector K of the disturbance from

the known azimuth α (see formula (5)).

Since the distance between GPS-array elements (from several tens to a few hundred

of kilometers) is much smaller than that to the GPS satellite (over 20000 km), the array

geometry at the height near the main maximum of the F2-layer is identical to that on

the ground.

Linear transformations of the diﬀerences of the values of the ﬁltered TEC (IB − IA)

and (IB − IC) at the receiving points A, B and C are used to calculate the components
of the TEC gradient I ′
I ′
t is determined by diﬀerentiating IB(t) at the point B.

y (Afraimovich et al., 1998). The time derivative of TEC

x and I ′

The resulting series are used to calculate instantaneous values of the horizontal ve-

locity Vh(t) and the azimuth α(t) of TID propagation. Next, the series Vh(t) and α(t)

are put to a statistical treatment. This involves constructing distributions of the hori-

zontal velocity P (Vh) and direction P (α) which are analyzed to test the hypothesis of

the existence of the preferred propagation direction. If such a direction does exist, then

the corresponding distributions are used to calculate the mean value of the horizontal

velocity hVhi, as well as the mean value of the azimuth hαi of TID propagation.

The correspondence of space-time TEC characteristics, obtained through transiono-

spheric soundings, with local characteristics of disturbances in the ionosphere was con-

sidered in detail in a wide variety of publications (Afraimovich et al., 1992; Mercier

and Jacobson, 1997) and is not analyzed at length in this study. The most impor-

tant conclusion of the cited references is the fact that, as for the extensively exploited

model of a ‘plane phase screen’, disturbances dI(x, y, t) of TEC faithfully copy the

horizontal part of the corresponding disturbance dN(x, y, z, t) of local concentration,

independently of the angular position of the source, and can be used in experiments

on measuring the wave velocity of TEC.

However, the TEC response amplitude experiences a strong ‘aspect’ dependence

caused by the integral character of a transionospheric sounding. As a ﬁrst approxima-

tion, the transionospheric sounding method is responsive only to TIDs with the wave
vector K perpendicular to the direction r of the LOS. A corresponding condition for
elevation θ and azimuth α of K has the form

tan θ = − cos(αs − α)/ tan θs

(5)

We used formula (5) in determining the elevation θ of K from the known mean

value of azimuth α by Afraimovich et al. (1998).

The phase velocity modulus V can be deﬁned as

V = Vh × cos(θ)

(6)

Hence at least the dynamic (two-dimensional) characteristics of TEC disturbances

(TECS in the case under consideration) may well be referred qualitatively to the cor-

responding characteristics dN/N of local electron density disturbances (IIDs). Recon-

structing the quantitative characteristics of local density disturbances, dN/N, in terms

of the solution of an inverse problem of transionospheric sounding is a highly diﬃcult,

special problem, constituting the subject of our further investigation.

On the basis of using the transformations described in this section, for each of the

GPS arrays chosen for the analysis we obtained the average for the selected time interval

values of the following TECS parameters: hαi and hθi – the azimuth and elevation of
the wave vector K; hVhi and hV i – the horizontal component and the phase velocity

modulus, the azimuth of a normal to the TECS front αc from the method reported by

Mercier (1986).

4.2 The dynamic characteristics of IIDs

For the PRN05 and PRN30 satellites, Fig. 1c and 1f give an example of the ﬁltered

TECS for diﬀerent spaced stations, and for the GPS satellites on October 5, 2001. It

is evident from the ﬁgure that the selected typical TEC variations such as TECS are

identical and shifted by a certain amount of delay, which makes it possible to calculate

the velocity and direction of the IID that causes the observed TEC variations. The

panels show the values of the IID velocity V and direction α inferred using the above

data processing procedures.

Using diﬀerent sets of GPS arrays for the entire California region we were able

to obtain stable mean estimates of the IID velocity modulus V , horizontal projection

Vh and direction α in the horizontal plane, as well as the elevation angle θ of the
displacement vector K in the vertical plane.

Fig. 7. present the distributions of the TECS parameters as determined by the

SADM-GPS method, for the ”trace” A (on the left; 660 arrays), and for the ”trace”

B (on the right; 280 arrays). a, d – modulus V (line 1) and horizontal component Vh

(line 2) of the TECS phase velocity; b, e – azimuth α; c, f – elevation θ of the TECS
wave vector K. Same parameters as in Fig.7, but for the ”trace” C (on the left; 376

arrays), and for the ”trace” D (on the right; 280 arrays), are presented on Fig.8.

According to our data, the following values were obtained (using SADM-GPS
method): < Vh >=179 m/s, V =160 m/s, α=360◦, and < θ >=22◦ for the trace”
A (Fig.7, on the left); < Vh >=190 m/s, V =165 m/s, α=5◦, and < θ >=27.6◦ for the
trace” B (Fig.7, on the right); < Vh >=171 m/s, V =151 m/s, α=5◦, and < θ >=24◦
for the trace” C (Fig.8, on the left); and < Vh >=90 m/s, V =74 m/s, α=360◦, and
< θ >=20◦ for the trace” D (Fig.8, on the right).

An analysis of the distribution of the azimuths P (α) (Figs. 7b, 7e, 8b, and 8e)

shows a clearly pronounced northward direction of TECS displacement. The elevation

of the TECS wave vector, determined from the aspect condition (5), has mostly a small

positive value (Figs. 7c, 7f, 8c, and 8f).

4.3 The anisotropy and sizes of IIDs

Let us consider in greater detail the ”traces” A, B, C, and D. Fig. 6 (a - d) plots the

dependencies of the values of the GPS station latitudes Ni on the time tmin,i, corre-

sponding to each of the TECS detected that day at all GPS stations of the California
region used in the analysis (220-260◦E; 28-42◦N); ﬁg. 6 (e - h) - same as above, but for

the station longitudes Ei and tmin,i. TECS only for a single selected satellite number

are considered for each trace.

Figs.6 (a - d) suggest the conclusion that at each given time there are only a few

TECS with close values of the coordinates Ni, and there is a clearly pronounced grad-

ual displacement of the subionospheric point in the northward meridional direction.

With a knowledge of the range of TECS displacement in latitude and the time interval

corresponding to this displacement, it is easy to determine that the meridional projec-

tion of the displacement velocity VN is close to 200 m/s, which is in agreement with

estimates obtained using the SADM-GPS method.

On the other hand, the dependencies of the longitude Ei of the TECS observed on

tmin,i suggest a spatial extent of the traveling irregularity in longitude.

Thus the shape of the observed irregularities (”traces” A, B, C, and D) show up as

ellipsoids traveling northward with a velocity of about 200 m/s.

The IID anisotropy was analyzed by determining the ”contrast” C (Mercier, 1986).

We calculated the ratio CN,E:

(7)

(8)

CN,E = σN /σE,

if σN > σE

CN,E = σE/σN ,

if σE > σN

where σN and σE are the standard deviations of the corresponding series of the

TECS coordinates Ni and Ei. These series were obtained by transforming the initial
series N ′

i by rotating the original coordinate system (N, E) by an angle β:

i and E′

N = N ′ sin β + E′ cos β
E = −N ′ cos β + E′ sin β

Mercier (1986) showed that it is possible to ﬁnd such a value of the rotation angle

β0, at which the ratio CN,E will be a maximum and equal to the value of contrast

C. This parameter characterizes the degree of anisotropy of the phase interference

pattern. The angle β0 in this case indicates the direction of elongation, and the angle
αc = β0 + π/2 indicates the direction of the wave vector K coincident (module 180◦)

with the propagation direction of the phase front.

Fig. 9 (a, c, e, g) plots the dependencies of the standard deviation σN (α) of the

values of the coordinates of subionospheric points in a topocentric coordinate system,

and of the corresponding to tmin, on the rotation angle αc=β0+π/2 (β stands for the

rotation angle of the original coordinate system) for the ”traces” A, B, C, and D (Figs.

5 and 6); Fig. 9 (b, d, f, h) plots the dependencies of the value of the ratio CN,E on

αc=β0+π/2. The values of the contrast C are shown by the horizontal dashed line.

It is apparent from the ﬁgure that the value of C ﬂuctuates from 6 to 10, and the

greatest contrast for the traces under consideration corresponds to the ”trace” C and,

hence, this trace has the greatest anisotropy.

Furthermore, the direction of elongation of the major axis of the IID ellipse β0 =
-85◦. For the other ”traces” the values of the parameter β0 lie in the range from -80◦
to -85◦. The panels show the mean values of the angles αc obtained by the method

reported in Mercier (1986), and the mean values of α inferred by the SADM-GPS

method (Afraimovich, 1997; Afraimovich et al., 1998; 1999; 2000c) for each of the

”traces”. As is evident from the ﬁgure, the values of the angle α, calculated by the two
methods, agree to within 5-10◦.

We now estimate the horizontal sizes of the IID. With the mean duration of 10 min

and the travel velocity of 180 m/s, we obtain the transverse size of the irregularity

equal to 108 km. With the value of the contrast C=9, the longitudinal size equal to

864 km.

4.4 Estimating the relative IID amplitude

Let us now obtain the mean estimate of the relative amplitude of a local electron

density disturbance typiﬁed by the IID of October 5, 2001.

A mean TECS absolute amplitude over California equal 0.1 T ECU (see Fig.1c,

f). As the background value of I0, we used the absolute ”vertical” TEC value of I0(t)

obtained from IONEX-maps of the TEC (see Fig.10c). These maps with two-hour

temporal resolution were constructed using the well-known methods and are placed on

the Internet site ftp://cddisa.gsfc.naa.gov/.

Fig.10c shows the variations of the absolute ”vertical” TEC value I0(t) for the site
with the coordinates 240◦E; 35◦N. At the lower time scale in Fig.10, the local time LT is
represented for the longitude of 240◦E. For comparison Fig.10d present the distribution

N(t) of the number of TECS that were detected that day at all GPS stations used in

the analysis, with the rms above ǫ=0.1 T ECU (this is copy of Fig.5f).

Comparison of Fig. 10c and d reveals that the greatest TECS occurrence probabil-

ity corresponds to the night-time hours for which the ”vertical” TEC value I0(t) does

not exceed 10 T ECU.

Hence the relative amplitude of TECS dI/I0 makes up 1%, that is quite signiﬁcant

for this disturbance period (∆T = 10 min) and exceeds one order of magnitude the

amplitude of typical background TEC ﬂuctuations (Afraimovich et al., 2001a).

It is further assumed that the characteristic vertical size of the IID is of the same

order as the transverse horizontal size (of about 100 km - see Section 4.3). The vertical

extent of the part of the ionosphere that makes the main contribution to the TEC

modulation is no less than 500-1000 km. Hence it follows that the relative amplitude

dN/N of the local electron density disturbance for IID reaches a considerably large

value, 5–10%.

5 Discussion

What is the nature of the ionospheric irregularities that are responsible for the occur-

rence of TECS, and Do they diﬀer from the known published ionospheric disturbances?

We shall try to unravel this situation using the sample statistic obtained in Section 3

and the October 5, 2001 event as an example, because for this event it was possible

not only to record a large number of TECS but also to obtain estimates of the size,

anisotropy and velocity of isolated ionospheric irregularities that are responsible for

the occurrence of TECS (Section 4).

It is signiﬁcant that, according to Internet data for the concerned region of the USA

and for the time interval of October 5, 2001 of our interest, there were not observable

meteorological phenomena (site http://www.solar.ifa.hawaii.edu/Tropical/), powerful

explosions and rocket launchings able to cause TEC variations of the TECS type. The
T itan − 4 rocket was launched from the ”Vandenberg” spaceport (239.5◦E; 34.8◦N) on

October 5 at 21:21 UT (the launching time is shown by the ﬁlled triangle in Fig.5f).

However, most TECS on that day were observed before the launching time.

As far as seismic activity is concerned, we analyzed the data covering not only

the time interval of our interest but also for the period from October 4 to 20, 2001

(http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/FM/previous/0107.html). No earthquakes with the

magnitude larger than 3.5 were recorded in the region of our interest for the above

time interval.

For the October 5, 2001, time interval of our interest, TEC ﬂuctuations similar

to TECS detected over California were absent elsewhere on the globe. No solar ﬂare-

induced background ﬂuctuations of the TEC disturbance were also revealed. A similar,

quiet, behavior over this time interval was also characteristic for the energetic particle

ﬂux. We do not present here the relevant data for reasons of space. They may be found

on the site http://www.sel.noaa.gov/ftpmenu/lists.html.

The geomagnetic situation on October 5, 2001 can be characterized as a weakly

disturbed one, which must lead to some increase of the level of TEC background

ﬂuctuations; however, this cannot cause any large-scale changes in electron density

which are characteristic for the geomagnetically disturbed ionosphere. In the analysis

of the geomagnetic situation we used the data from magnetic observatory Victoria
(48.52◦N; 236.58◦E) which, for the time interval 15:00 - 18:00 UT of our interest,

recorded a geomagnetic disturbance implying a decrease of the horizontal component

of the magnetic ﬁeld by 100 nT (Fig. 5b).

This disturbance was also accompanied by an increase of the H-component ﬂuc-

tuation amplitude in the range of 2-20-min periods (Fig.5c). The variation range of
the geomagnetic Dst-index for the selected time interval was also relatively small (no

more than 20 nT); however, the period from 08:00 to 15:00 UT showed a clearly pro-
nounced increase in variations of the Dst-index that coincided with the period when

the H-component of the magnetic ﬁeld was increasing (Fig. 5a).

Hence, the data from magnetic-variation stations do not suggest the conclusion that

the observed TECSs are associated with magnetic ﬁeld variations.

5.1 The diﬀerence of TECS from the TEC response to shock-

acoustic waves generated due to rocket launchings and

earthquakes

First of all, it is important to remark that TECS variations are close in amplitude, form

and duration to the TEC response to shock-acoustic waves (SAW) generated during

rocket launchings (Calais and Minster, 1996; Calais et al., 1998b; Li et al., 1994;

Afraimovich et al., 2000a; 2001b), earthquakes (Calais and Minster, 1995; Afraimovich

et al., 2001c), and explosions (Fitzgerald, 1997; Calais et al., 1998a). In this connection,

TECS can mask TEC responses to technogenic eﬀects and lead to spurious signals

recorded in detection systems for such eﬀects, based on analyzing signals from the

global GPS network.

Afraimovich et al. (2000a; 2001b; 2001c) found that spite of a diﬀerence of rock-

ets and earthquakes characteristics, the ionospheric TEC response for all such events

had the character of an N–wave corresponding to the form of a shock wave. The

SAW period ∆T is 270–360 s, and the amplitude exceeds the standard deviation of

total electron content background ﬂuctuations in this range of periods under quiet and

moderate geomagnetic conditions by factors of 2 to 5 as a minimum. The angle of
elevation θ of the SAW wave vector varies from 30◦ to 60◦, and the SAW phase velocity

V (900–1200 m/s) approaches the sound velocity at heights of the ionospheric F -region

maximum.

A spatial and temporal processing of data from GPS arrays can be used in selecting

these phenomena in order to estimate the propagation velocity of TEC disturbances.

In particular, the velocity of IIDs (150–200 m/s) is far less than the SAW velocity (900–

1200 m/s) and is most likely to correspond to the propagation velocity of medium-scale

background AGW (Kalikhman, 1980; Afraimovich et al., 1998; 1999; Mercier, 1986;

Mercier and Jacobson, 1997; Hocke and Schlegel, 1996; Oliver et al., 1997). The

SAW and IID responses can be distinguished using this attribute, as well as from the

diﬀerence of angular characteristics of the disturbance wave vector (see Section 4).

5.2 Can TECS be caused by the Es-layer ionospheric irregu-

larities that are responsible for S- and QP-scintillations?

As has been pointed out in the Introduction, a large number of publications (e.g.,

Karasawa, 1985; Titheridge, 1971; etc.), were devoted to the study the ”spikes-type”

(S-) scintillations.

Bowman (1989) observed quasi-periodic (QP) oscillations of the signal from an

orbiting satellite at 150 MHz frequency. The anticipated cause of the occurrence of

such QP oscillations is Fresnel diﬀraction from ionospheric irregularities. Evidently,

irregularities giving rise to QP oscillations reside in the Es level containing a host of

small regions (less than 200 m in size) with high electron density separated from one

another by a distance of several tens of kilometers. The occurrence of QP oscillations

is peaked in the night-time hours. The calculated velocities of irregularities and Es

structures range from 50 to 100 m/s.

The cited authors point out that transionospheric signal variations of this kind are

observed mostly at night and are most likely caused by the irregularities located in

the Es-layer. This brings up the question of whether the TECS recorded by us are

able to be caused by such ionospheric irregularities. At this point it should be noted

that TECS are also observed mostly at night, and their velocities (on the order of 100

km/s) are close to those obtained by Karasawa (1985), Titheridge (1971), and Bowman

In order to verify the validity of this TECS model for the October 5, 2001 event

we availed ourselves of the data (placed on the site http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/)

from the ionospheric station Point Arguello located in the center of the region of our

(1989).

interest.

Fig.10a present the values of the critical frequencies f0F2 – heavy dots; f0Es –

crosses; f0E –shaded triangles, measured on October, 5, 2001 at ionospheric station
Point Arguello (239.4◦E; 34.6◦N); Fig.10b – variations of virtual height h′E – shaded
triangles, h′Es – crosses.

An analysis of the dependence of critical frequencies and eﬀective heights of re-

ﬂections from the F - and Es-regions showed that during 08-14 UT when the largest

number of TECS was recorded, reﬂections from the Es-layer were absent altogether

(cf. panels a, b, d).

Thus we did not obtain any direct conﬁrmation of the fact that TECS were caused

by intense ionospheric irregularities located in the Es-layer. The question of the origin

of the IID that are responsible for TECS remains open.

It should be noted that direct comparison of our results with the data obtained by

Karasawa (1985), Titheridge (1971), and Bowman (1989), is made diﬃcult by the fact

that the overwhelming amount of earlier data was obtained for amplitude, rather than

phase, scintillations. On the other hand, extracting data on amplitude variations of

GPS signals from Internet RINEX-ﬁles is highly diﬃcult (Gurtner, 1993).

To understand the nature of TECS requires invoking data from diﬀerent, indepen-

dent diagnostic tools, including incoherent scatter radars, ionosondes, magnetometers,

etc.

6 Conclusion

Main results of this study may be summarized as follows:

1. TECS constitute a rare event that occurs mainly in the night-time in the spring

and autumn periods, in a weakly disturbed or quiet geomagnetic situation.

2. In the time region, TECS represent single negative aperiodic abrupt changes of

TEC with a duration of about 10-20 min; the mean value of the TECS amplitude

exceeds the mean value of the TEC variation amplitude by a factor of 4-5 as a

minimum and is 0.2 T ECU.

not larger than 500 km.

3. TECS represent a local phenomenon with a typical radius of spatial correlation

4. The TECS we recorded on October 5, 2001, were caused by isolated ionospheric

irregularities of the ellipsoid shape, with the direction of elongation of the major
axis of the ellipse on the order of -85◦. IIDs travel in a direction perpendicular

to their elongation (northward in the case under consideration) with the mean

velocity < V >=160 m/s, which corresponds to the velocity of medium-scale

AGW (of about 100-200 m/s). The size of the observed irregularities is 100 km

by 800 km, respectively.

We are aware that this study has revealed only the key averaged patterns of this

phenomena, and we hope that it would give impetus to a wide variety of more detailed

investigations.

Figure 4: Geometry of the experiment on detection of TECS on October

5, 2001 in California, USA, from 08:00 to 10:00 UT. Heavy dots show the

GPS stations, and small dots show the location of subionospheric points for

receiver-satellite LOS. Panel a shows the stations and subionospheric points

for all LOS's. Panels b and c show the stations and subionospheric points

where the TEC variations revealed TECS with an amplitude exceeding the

speci(cid:12)ed threshold (cid:15)=0.01 T EC U (b), and (cid:15)=0.1 T EC U (c). Numbers in

all panels show the total number of LOS's shown in the panel.

Abstract. The method of recurrence plots is extended to the
cross recurrence plots (CRP), which among others enables
the study of synchronization or time differences in two time
series. This is emphasized in a distorted main diagonal in
the cross recurrence plot, the line of synchronization (LOS).
A non-parametrical ﬁt of this LOS can be used to rescale
the time axis of the two data series (whereby one of it is
e. g. compressed or stretched) so that they are synchronized.
An application of this method to geophysical sediment core
data illustrates its suitability for real data. The rock magnetic
data of two different sediment cores from the Makarov Basin
can be adjusted to each other by using this method, so that
they are comparable.

Introduction

The adjustment of data sets with various time scales occurs
in many occasions, e. g. data preparation of tree rings or geo-
physical proﬁles. In geology, often a large set of geophysi-
cal data series is gained at various locations (e. g. sediment
cores). That is why these data series have a different length
and time scale. Before any time series analysis can be started,
the data series have to be synchronized to the same time
scale. Usually, this is done visually by comparing and cor-
relating each maximum and minimum in both data sets by
hand (wiggle matching), which includes the human factor of
subjectiveness and is a lengthy process. An automatical and
objective method for veriﬁcation should be very welcome.

In the last decades some techniques for this kind of corre-
lation and adjustment were suggested. They span graphical
methods (Prell et al., 1986), inverse algorithms, e. g. using
Fourier series (Martinson et al., 1982) and algorithms based
on similarity of data, e. g. sequence slotting (Thompson and
Clark, 1989).

However, we focus on a method based on nonlinear time
series analysis. During our investigations of the method of

cross recurrence plots (CRP), we have found an interesting
feature of it. Besides the possibility of the application of the
recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis (RQA) of Webber and Zbi-
lut on CRPs (1998), there is a more fundamental relation be-
tween the structures in the CRP and the considered systems.
Finally, this feature can be used for the task of the synchro-
nization of data sets. Although the ﬁrst steps of this method
are similar to the sequence slotting method, their roots are
different.

First we give an introduction in CRPs. Then we explain
the relationship between the structures in the CRP and the
systems and illustrate this with a simple model. Finally we
apply the CRP on geophysical data in order to synchronize
various proﬁles and to show their practical availability. Since
we focus on the synchronization feature of the CRP, we will
not give a comparison between the different alignment meth-
ods.

2 The Recurrence Plot

Recurrence plots (RP) were ﬁrstly introduced by Eckmann
et al. (1987) in order to visualize time dependent behaviour
of orbits ~xi in the phase space. A RP represents the recur-
rence of the phase space trajectory to a state. The recurrence
of states is a fundamental property of deterministic dynami-
cal systems (Argyris et al., 1994; Casdagli, 1997; Kantz and
Schreiber, 1997). The main step of the visualization is the
calculation of the N × N -matrix

Ri, j = Θ

ε − k~xi − ~xjk

,
(cid:1)

i, j = 1 . . . N,

(1)

where ε is a predeﬁned cut-off distance, k · k is the norm
(e. g. the Euclidean norm) and Θ(x) is the Heaviside func-
tion. The values one and zero in this matrix can be simply
visualized by the colours black and white. Depending on the
kind of the application, ε can be a ﬁxed value or it can be
changed for each i in such a way that in the ball with the ra-
dius ε a predeﬁned amount of neighbours occurs. The latter

will provide a constant density of recurrence points in each
column of the RP.

The recurrence plot exhibits characteristic patterns for typ-
ical dynamical behaviour (Eckmann et al., 1987; Webber Jr.
and Zbilut, 1994): A collection of single recurrence points,
homogeneously and irregularly distributed over the whole
plot, reveals a mainly stochastic process. Longer, parallel
diagonals formed by recurrence points and with the same
distance between the diagonals are caused by periodic pro-
cesses. A paling of the RP away from the main diagonal to
the corners reveals a drift in the amplitude of the system.
Vertical and horizontal white bands in the RP result from
states which occur rarely or represent extreme states. Ex-
tended horizontal and vertical black lines or areas occur if a
state does not change for some time, e. g. laminar states. All
these structures were formed by using the property of recur-
rence of states. It should be pointed out that the states are
only the “same” and recur in the sense of the vicinity, which
is determined by the distance ε. RPs and their quantitative
analysis (RQA) became more well known in the last decade
(e. g. Casdagli, 1997). Their applications to a wide ﬁeld of
miscellaneous research show their suitability in the analysis
of short and non-stationary data.

3 The Cross Recurrence Plot

Analogous to Zbilut et al. (1998), we have expanded the
method of recurrence plots (RP) to the method of cross re-
currence plots. In contrast to the conventional RP, two time
series are simultaneously embedded in the same phase space.
The test for closeness of each point of the ﬁrst trajectory xi
(i = 1 . . . N ) with each point of the second trajectory yj
(j = 1 . . . M ) results in a N × M array

(2)

CRi, j = Θ

ε − k~xi − ~yjk
(cid:0)

.
(cid:1)

Its visualization is called the cross recurrence plot (CRP).
The deﬁnition of the closeness between both trajectories can
be varied as described above. Varying ε may be useful to
handle systems with different amplitudes.

The CRP compares the considered systems and allows us
to benchmark the similarity of states. In this paper we fo-
cus on the bowed “main diagonal” in the CRP, because it is
related to the frequencies and phases of the systems consid-
ered.

4 The Line of Synchronization in the CRP

Regarding the conventional RP, Eq. 1, one always ﬁnds a
main diagonal in the plot, because of the identity of the (i, i)-
states. The RP can be considered as a special case of the
CRP, Eq. 2, which usually does not have a main diagonal as
the (i, i)-states are not identical.

In data analysis one is often faced with time series that
are measured on varying time scales. These could be sets
from borehole or core data in geophysics or tree rings in

leads to a deforming of the synchronization line.

dendrochronology. Sediment cores might have undergone a
number of coring disturbances such as compression or stretch-
ing. Moreover, cores from different sites with differing sed-
imentation rates would have different temporal resolutions.
All these factors require a method of synchronizing.

A CRP of the two corresponding time series will not con-
tain a main diagonal. But if the sets of data are similar
e. g. only rescaled, a more or less continuous line in the CRP
that is like a distorted main diagonal can occur. This line
contains information on the rescaling. We give an illustrative
example. A CRP of a sine function with itself (i. e. this is the
RP) contains a main diagonal (black CRP in Fig. 1). Hence,
the CRPs in the Fig. 1 are computed with embeddings of di-
mension one, further diagonal lines from the upper left to
the lower right occur. These lines typify the similarity of the
phase space trajectories in positive and negative time direc-
tion.

Now we rescale the time axis of the second sine function

in the following way

(3)

ϕt + a sin(ψt)
sin(ϕt) −→ sin
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

We will henceforth use the notion rescaling only in the
mention of the rescaling of the time scale. The rescaling of
the second sine function with different parameters ϕ results
in a deformation of the main diagonal (green and red CRP
in Fig. 1). The distorted line contains the information on the
rescaling, which we will need in order to re-synchronize the
two time series. Therefore, we call this distorted diagonal
line of synchronization (LOS).

In the following, we present a toy function to explain the
procedure. If we consider a one dimensional case without

(4)

embedding, the CRP is computed with

CR(t1, t2) = Θ

ε − kf (t1) − g(t2)k
(cid:0)

.
(cid:1)

If we set ε = 0 to simplify the condition, Eq. (4) delivers

a recurrence point if

f (t1) = g(t2).

In general, this is an implicit condition that links the variable
t1 to t2. Considering the physical examples of above, it can
be assumed that the time series are essentially the same – that
means that f = g – up to a rescaling function of time. So we
can state

f (t1) = f

.
φ(t1)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

If the functions f (·) and g(·) are not identical our method is
in general not capable of deciding if the difference in the time
series is due to different dynamics (f (·) 6= g(·)) or if it is due
to simple rescaling. So the assumption that the dynamics is
alike up to a rescaling in time is essential. Even though for
some cases where f 6= g it can be applied in the same way. If
we consider the functions f (·) = a · ¯f (·) + b and g(·) = ¯g(·),
whereby f (·) 6= g(·) are the observations and ¯f (·) = ¯g(·)
are the states, normalization with respect to the mean and the
standard deviation allows us to use our method.

f (·) = a · ¯f (·) + b −→ ˜f (·) =

f (·) − hf (·)i
σ (f (·))

˜g(·) =

g(·) − hg(·)i
σ (g(·))

With ¯g(·) = ¯f (·) the functions ˜f (·) and ˜g(·) are the same af-
ter the normalization. Then our method can be applied with-
out any further modiﬁcation.

In some special cases Eq. (6) can be resolved with respect
to t1. Such a case is a system of two sine functions with
different frequencies

f (t) = sin(ϕ · t + α)

g(t) = sin(ψ · t + β)

Using Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) we ﬁnd

sin (ϕ t1 + α) − sin (ψ t2 + β) = 0

and one explicit solution of this equation is

⇒ t2 = φ(t1) =

t1 + γ

ϕ
ψ

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

with γ = α−β
ψ . In this special case the slope of the main
line in a cross recurrence plot represents the frequency ratio
and the distance between the axes origin and the intersec-
tion of the line of synchronization with the ordinate reveals
the phase difference. The function t2 = φ(t1) (Eq. 6) is a
transfer or rescaling function which allows us to rescale the
second system to the ﬁrst system. If the rescaling function is
not linear the LOS will also be curved.

For the application one has to determine the LOS – usually
non-parametrically – and then rescale one of the time series.

103

In the Appendix we describe a simple algorithm for esti-
mating the LOS. Its determination will be better for higher
embeddings because the vertical and cross-diagonal struc-
tures will vanish. We do not conceal that the embedding of
the time series is connected with difﬁculties. The Takens
Embedding Theorem holds for closed, deterministic systems
without noise, only. If noise is present one needs its real-
ization to ﬁnd a reasonable embedding. For stochastic time
series it does not make sense to consider a phase space and
so embedding is in general not justiﬁed here either (Romano,
to be published; Takens, 1981).

The choice of a special embedding lag could be correct
for one section of the data, but incorrect for another (for an
example see below). This can be the case if the data is non-
stationary. Furthermore, the choice of method of computing
the CRP and the threshold ε will inﬂuence the quality of the
estimated LOS.

The next sections will be dedicated to application.

5 Application to a Simple Example

At ﬁrst, we consider two sine functions f (t) = sin(ϕt) and
g(t) = sin(ψt2), where the time scale of the second sine
differs from the ﬁrst by a quadratic term and the frequency
ψ = 0.01 ϕ. Sediment parameters are related to such kind
of functions because gravity pressure increases nonlinearly
with the depth. It can be assumed that both data series come
from the same process and were subjected to different de-
posital compressions (e. g. a squared or exponential increas-
ing of the compression). Their CRP contains a bowed LOS
(Fig. 2). We have used the embedding parameters dimension
m = 2, delay τ = π/2 and a varying threshold ε, so that the
CRP contains a constant recurrence density of 20 %. Assum-
ing that the time scale of g is not the correct scale, we denote
that scale by t′. In order to determine the non-parametrical
LOS, we have implemented the algorithm described in the
Appendix. Although this algorithm is still not mature, we ob-
tained reliable results (Fig. 3). The resulting rescaling func-
tion has the expected squared shape t = φ(t′) = 0.01 t′2
(red curve in Fig. 3). Substituting the time scale t′ in the sec-
ond data series g(t′) by this rescaling function t = φ(t′), we
get a set of synchronized data f (t) and g(t) with the non-
parametric rescaling function t = φ(t′) (Fig. 4). The syn-
chronized data series are approximately the same. The cause
of some differences is the meandering of the LOS, which it-
self is caused by partial weak embedding. Nevertheless, this
can be avoided by more complex algorithm for estimating the
LOS.

6 Application to Real Data

In order to continue the illustration of the working of our
method we have applied it to real data from geology.

In the following we compare the method of cross recur-
rence plot matching with the conventional method of visual
wiggle matching (interactive adjustment). Geophysical data

of two sediment cores from the Makarov Basin, central Arc-
tic Ocean, PS 2178-3 and PS 2180-2, were analysed. The
task should be to adjust the data of the PS 2178-3 data (data
length N = 436) to the scale of the PS 2180-2 (data length
N = 251) in order to get a depth-depth-function which al-
lows to synchronize both data sets (Fig. 5).

We have constructed the phase space with the normalized
six parameters low ﬁeld magnetic susceptibility (κLF ), an-
hysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM ), ratio of anhys-
teretic susceptibility to κLF (κARM /κLF ), relative palaeoin-
tensity (PJA), median destructive ﬁeld of ARM (MDFARM )
and inclination (INC). A comprehensive discussion of the
data is given in Nowaczyk et al. (2001). The embedding was
combined with the time-delayed method according to (Tak-
ens, 1981) in order to increase further the dimension of the
phase-space with the following rule: If we have n parameters
ai, the embedding with dimension m and delay τ will result
in a (m · n)-dimensional phase space:

~x(t) =

a1(t), . . . , an(t),

a1(t + 2τ ), . . . , an(t + 2τ ), . . .

For our investigation we have used a dimension m = 3
and a delay τ = 1, which ﬁnally led to a phase space of

dimension 18 (3 × 6). The recurrence criterion was ε = 5 %
nearest neighbours.

The resulting CRP shows a clear LOS and some clustering
of black patches (Fig. 6). The latter occurs due to the plateaus
in the data. The next step is to ﬁt a non-parametric function
(the depth-depth-curve) to the LOS in the CRP (red curve in
Fig. 6). With this function we are able to adjust the data of
the PS 2178-3 core to the scale of PS 2180-2 (Fig. 8).

The determination of the depth-depth-function with the
conventional method of visual wiggle matching is based on
the interactive and parallel searching for the same structures
in the different parameters of both data sets. If the adjust-
ment does not work in a section of the one parameter, one
can use another parameter for this section, which allows the
multivariate adjustment of the data sets. The recognition of
the same structures in the data sets requires a degree of expe-
rience. However, human eyes are usually better in the visual
assessment of complex structures than a computational algo-
rithm.

Our depth-depth-curve differs slightly from the curve which
was gained by the visual wiggle matching (Fig. 7). How-
ever, despite our (still) weak algorithm used to ﬁt the non-
parametric adjustment function to the LOS, we obtained a
good result of adjusted data series. If they are well adjusted,
the correlation coefﬁcient between the parameters of the ad-
justed data and the reference data should not vary so much.
The correlation coefﬁcients between the reference and ad-
justed data series is about 0.70 – 0.80, where the correlation
coefﬁcients of the interactive rescaled data varies from 0.71 –
0.87 (Tab. 1). The χ2 measure of the correlation coefﬁcients
emphasizes more variation for the wiggle matching than for
the CRP rescaling.

7 Discussion

Cross recurrence plots (CRP) reveal similarities in the states
of the two systems. A similar trajectory evolution gives a di-
agonal structure in the CRP. An additional time dilatation or
compression of one of these similar trajectories causes a dis-
tortion of this diagonal structure (Fig. 1). This effect is used
to look into the synchronization between both systems. Syn-
chronized systems have diagonal structures along and in the
direction of the main diagonal in the CRP. Interruptions of
these structures with gaps are possible because of variations
in the amplitudes of both systems. However, a loss of syn-
chronization is viewable by the distortion of this structures
along the main diagonal (LOS). By ﬁtting a non-parametric
function to the LOS one allows to re-synchronization or ad-
justment to both systems at the same time scale. Although
this method is based on principles from deterministic dynam-
ics, no assumptions about the underlying systems has to be

cance level, when the test measure ˆz is greater than z0.01 = 2.576.

made in order for the method to work.

The ﬁrst example shows the obvious relationship between
the LOS and the time domains of the considered time se-
ries. The squared increasing of the frequency of the second
harmonic function causes a parabolic LOS shape in the CRP
(Fig. 2). Finally, with this LOS we are able to rescale the
second function to the scale of the ﬁrst harmonic function
(Fig. 4). Some differences in the amplitude of the result are
caused by the algorithm used in order to extract the LOS from
the CRP. However, our concern is to focus on the distorted
main diagonal and their relationship with the time domains.

The second example deals with real geological data and al-
lows a comparison with the result of the conventional method
of visual wiggle matching. The visual comparison of the ad-
justed data shows a good concordance with the reference and
the wiggle matched data (Fig. 8 and 9). The depth-depth-
function differs up to 20 centimeters from the depth-depth-
function of the wiggle matching. The correlation coefﬁcients
between the CRP adjusted data and the reference data varies
less than the correlation coefﬁcients of the wiggle matching.
However, the correlation coefﬁcients for the CRP adjusted
data are smaller than these for the wiggle matched data. Al-
though their correlation is better, it seems that the interactive
method does not produce a balanced adjusting, whereas the
automatic matching looks for a better balanced adjusting.

These both examples exhibits the ability to work with smooth

and non-smooth data, whereby the result will be better for
smooth data. Small ﬂuctuations in the non-smooth data can
be handled by the LOS searching algorithm. Therefore, smooth-
ing strategies, like smoothing or parametrical ﬁt of the LOS,
are not necessary. The latter would damp one advantage of
this method, that the LOS is yielded as a non-parametrical
function. A future task will be the optimization of the LOS
searching algorithm, in order to get a clear LOS even if the
data are non-smooth. Further, the inﬂuence of dynamical
noise to the result will be studied. Probably, this problem
may be bypassed by a suitable LOS searching algorithm too.

Our method has conspicuous similarities with the method
of sequence slotting described by Thompson and Clark (1989).
The ﬁrst step in this method is the calculation of a distance
matrix similar to our Eq. 2, which allows the use of multi-
variate data sets. Thompson and Clark (1989) referred to the
distance measure as dissimilarity. It is used to determine the
alignment function in such a way that the sum of the dissimi-
larities along a path in the distance matrix is minimized. This
approach is based on dynamic programming methods which
were mainly developed for speech pattern recognition in the
70’s (e. g. Sakoe and Chiba, 1978). In contrast, RPs were
developed to visualize the phase space behaviour of dynam-
ical systems. Therefore, a threshold was introduced to make
recurrent states visible. The involving of a ﬁxed amount of
nearest neighbours in the phase space and the possibility to
increase the embedding dimensions distinguish this approach
from the sequence slotting method.

this algorithm.) The next step is to set the recurrence point
riα+1,jβ+1 to a new start point and to begin with the step one
in order to ﬁnd the next recurrence point. These steps are
repeated until the end of the RP is reached.

We know that this algorithm is merely one of many possi-
bilities. The following criteria should be met in order to ob-
tain a good LOS. The amount of targeted recurrence points
by the LOS N1 should converge to the maximum and the
amount of gaps in the LOS N0 should converge to the min-
imum. An analysis with various estimated LOS conﬁrms this
requirement. The correlation between two LOS-synchronized
data series arises with N1 and with 1/N0 (the correlation co-
efﬁcient correlates most strongly with the ratio N1/N0).

The algorithm for computation of the CRP and recogni-
tion of the LOS are available as Matlab programmes on the
WWW: http://www.agnld.uni-potsdam.de/~marwan.

8 Conclusion

The cross recurrence plot (CRP) can contain information about
the synchronization of data series. This is revealed by the
distorted main diagonal, which is called line of synchroniza-
tion (LOS). After isolating this LOS from the CRP, one ob-
tains a non-parametric rescaling function. With this function,
one can synchronize the time series. The underlying more-
dimensional phase space allows to include more than one pa-
rameter in this synchronization method, as it usually appears
in geological applications, e. g. core synchronization. The
comparison of CRP adjusted geophysical core data with the
conventionally visual matching shows an acceptable reliabil-
ity level of the new method, which can be further improved
by a better method for estimating the LOS. The advantage
is the automatic, objective and multivariate adjustment. Fi-
nally, this method of CRPs can open a wide range of applica-
tions as scale adjustment, phase synchronization and pattern
recognition for instance in geology, molecular biology and
ecology.

Appendix: An Algorithm to Fit the LOS

In order to implement a recognition of the LOS we have used
the following simple two-step algorithm. Denote all recur-
( ˜α, ˜β = 1, 2, . . .) and the recurrence
rence points by ri ˜α,j ˜β
points lying on the LOS by riα,jβ (α, β = 1, 2, . . .). Be-
fore the common algorithm starts, ﬁnd the recurrence point
ri1,j1 next to the axes origin. In the ﬁrst step, the next re-
after a previous determined recurrence
currence point ri ˜α,j ˜β
point riα,jβ is to be determined. This is carried out by a step-
wise increasing of a squared (w×w) sub-matrix, wherein the
previous recurrence point is at the (1, 1)-location. The size
w of this sub-matrix increases step-wise until it meets a new
recurrence point or the margin of the CRP. When a next re-
currence point ri ˜α,j ˜β = riα+δi,jβ +δj (δi = w or δj = w) in
the x-direction (y-direction) is found, the second step looks
if there are following recurrence points in y-direction (x-
direction). If this is true (e. g. there are a cluster of recur-
rence points) increase further the sub-matrix in y-direction
(x-direction) until a predeﬁned size (w + d˜x) × (w + d˜y)
(d˜x < dx, d˜y < dy) or until no new recurrence points are
met. This further increasing of the sub-matrix is done for
the both x- and y-direction. Using d˜x, d˜y we compute the
next recurrence point riα+1,jβ+1 by determination of the cen-
ter of mass of the cluster of recurrence points with iα+1 =
iα + (d˜x + δi)/2 and jβ+1 = jβ + (d˜y + δj)/2. The latter
avoids the fact that the algorithm is driven around widespread
areas of recurrence points. Instead of this, the algorithm lo-
cates the LOS within these areas. (However, the introduc-
ing of two additional parameter dx and dy is a disadvan-
tage which should be avoided in further improvements of

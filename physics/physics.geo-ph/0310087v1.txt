The North Greenland Ice Core Project (NorthGRIP) provides paleoclimatic information back to
at least 115 kyr before present [Dahl-Jensen et al., 2002]. Each year, precipitation on the ice sheet
covers it with a new layer of snow, which gradually transforms into ice crystals as the layer sinks into
the ice sheet. The size distribution of ice crystals has been measured at selected depths in the upper
880 m of the NorthGRIP ice core [Svensson et al., 2003b], which cover a time span of 5300 years. The
distributions change with time toward a universal curve, indicating a common underlying physical
process in the formation of crystals. We identify this process as an interplay between fragmentation
of the crystals and diﬀusion of their grain boundaries. The process is described by a two-parameter
diﬀerential equation to which we obtain the exact solution. The solution is in excellent agreement
with the experimentally observed distributions.

The NorthGRIP drilling location (75.10 N, 42.32 W) is
situated on an ice ridge with an ice thickness of 3085 m.
The mean annual temperature is -32 deg. Celsius and the
annual accumulation in the area is on the average 19.5
cm ice equivalent. In the upper 80 m of the ice sheet, the
ﬁrn, the snow gradually compacts to a close packing of
ice crystals of typical sizes 1 to 5 mm. We apply crystal
size distributions obtained from ﬁfteen vertical thin sec-
tions of ice evenly distributed in the depth interval 115
- 880 m [Svensson et al., 2003b]. The thin sections have
dimensions of 20 cm × 10 cm (height × width) and a
thickness of 0.4±0.1 mm.

Vertical crystal size (mm)

FIG. 2: Distributions of ice crystal sizes at depths 115m,
165m, 220m, 330m, 440m and 605m. The crystal size is de-
ﬁned as the vertical extension of the individual crystals. The
black lines are the measured histograms and the smooth lines
are the temporal evolution predicted by eq. (1) starting from
the initial distribution at 115m. The total counts of ice crys-
tals decreases with depth (due to the overall increase of sizes)
until the steady state is reached.

Fig.2 shows size distributions of ice crystals at selected
depths down to 880 m (5300 years before present (B.P.)).
The crystal size is deﬁned as the vertical extend of a crys-
tal [12]. Each distribution exhibits a pronounced peak,
indicating a typical crystal size at each depth, followed
by an exponentially decaying tail of relatively large crys-
tals. The mean size becomes larger with depth and thus
time until it saturates [Thorsteinsson et al., 1996; Jun et
al., 1998]. The most important physical process behind
such growth is due to diﬀusion of grain boundaries be-

FIG. 1: An image of a 10 x 10 cm2 vertical thin section of
ice from the depth 115 m. The section is viewed between
two crossed linear polarizers and the diﬀerent colors represent
almost 3000 individual crystals with various orientations of
the crystal optical c-axes.

Digital images from crossed linear polarizers have been
used to map the dimensions of individual ice crystals in
the sample (Fig. 1). The ages of the considered sam-
ples are all less than 5300 years[Johnsen et al., 2001] in

tween the diﬀerent ice crystals. Inhomogenieties on the
crystal boundaries, characterized by small radii of curva-
ture, tend to be smoothened out as time progresses. This
causes the inhomogenieties to be incorporated into the
larger crystals leading to an overall growth of the mean
size [Alley et al., 1986; Paterson, 1994]. This diﬀusion
process has been modelled in details by Thorsteinsson
(see also Ref. [Thorsteinsson et al., 1996] who proposed
an approximative description in terms of a parabolic law
hx2i = x2
0 + kt, where x is the crystal diamater, x0 the
initial diameter and k the growth rate. In general the law
may be modiﬁed by a variable power in the diameter, i.e.
hxni (see also Ref. [Thorsteinsson et al., 1996]. This law
ﬁts the experimental observations well up to 2500 B.P.
By deﬁnition, however, the diﬀusion does not cause the
diameter to saturate which is in disagreement with the
actual observations that clearly indicates a saturation in
hx2i after 2500 B.P. [Alley et al., 1986]. The important
missing part of the physical mechanism in this model is
the fact that all crystals, and in particular the large ones,
will be subjected to fragmentation processes due to the
non-hydrostatic stresses in the ice. We here include this
process in the description which then leads to a physi-
cal model with a balance between the diﬀusion of grain
boundaries and the fragmentation of crystals causing the
mean crystal size to saturate after 2500 B.P.

Our proposed model is formulated as a rate equation in
the quantity N (x, t), which is the density of ice crystals
of length x at time t measured B.P. At a given time,
N (x, t) can be increased or decreased by diﬀusion with a
diﬀusion constant D. It can receive fragments of size x
from fragmentations of larger crystals and it can decrease
by its own fragmentation. The fragmentation is deﬁned
as a rate f in length and time, i.e.
for a given time
step dt the average number of fragmentation events over
a length L is f Ldt. The fragmentation rate f , and the
diﬀusion constant D, will depend on temperature, non-
hydrostatic stresses in the ice and moreover be sensitive
to the impurity content of the ice [Alley et al.,1986].

These diﬀusion and fragmentation processes lead to an

integral-diﬀerential equation on the form

∂N (x, t)
∂t

= D

∂2N (x, t)

∂x2 − f xN (x, t)+ 2f

N (x′, t)dx′

(1)
Here, the second term of the right hand side is the frag-
mentation of crystals of size x whereas the last term is
the contribution from fragmentation of larger crystals.
The factor of 2 is due to the two ways a crystal of size
x′ > x can fragment into size x.

Dividing through by f , making a proper rescaling of
the time and diﬀerentiating with respect to x on both
sides, we end up having a third order diﬀerential equa-
tion with only one parameter a = D/f . The new equa-
tion has solutions which are explicitly given in terms of
Bessel functions. We shall here, for simplicity, write the

where the cn’s can be computed from the distribution
at time t = t0 (for further details see the work of
[Ferkinghoﬀ-Borg et al., 2003]). For large times the only
term that survives is B(x/a1/3), the steady state dis-
tribution. The characteristic time, τ , it takes to reach
steady state is given by the second largest eigenvalue,
λ1, i.e. τ = −1/(λ1f ) ≈ (2.338 · f · a1/3)−1.

When the dynamics has reached steady state, and
the mean crystal size has saturated, the distribution is
described by the single parameter, a1/3, which deﬁnes
the characteristic length scale of the system.
In par-
ticular, the mean vertical size in the steady state is

where hxi0 is the observed average length at time t0 =
500 years. From the ﬁgure, we estimate the characteris-
tic time, τ = 600 ± 100 years and the average length in
the steady state hxi∞ = 2.9 ± 0.1 mm. The two parame-
ters correspond to an eﬀective fragmentation rate and a
diﬀusion constant of respectively f = (3.6 ± 0.2) · 10−4
mm−1·yr−1 and D = (2.8 ± 0.4) · 10−3 mm2yr−1.

Using these estimates, we can predict the time evolu-
tion of crystal sizes from any initial distribution. The
solid lines in Fig. 2 show the time evolution of the distri-
bution observed at time t0 = 500 years (depth 115m), in
good agreement with the experimental results.

During an annual cycle, the impurity content and the
average crystal size show important variations with the
highest dust load and the smallest crystals appearing dur-
ing spring [Svensson et al., 2003a]. Because the size of the
applied samples (20 cm depth) is close to the annual accu-
mulation at NorthGRIP (19.5 cm ice equivalent), the sea-
sonal variability will be averaged out in the experimental
data. Still, some inter-annual variations in the impurity
content of the ice are observed [Svensson et al., 2003a].
These ﬂuctuations may explain the small discrepancies
in Figs. 2 and 3, since the values of D and f are deter-
mined by the average concentration. We can take these
ﬂuctuations into account at larger depths by rescaling the
distributions. In Fig. 4 we demonstrate that this results
in a universal curve, described by the steady state Bessel
function solution which is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
widely used log-normal distribution. The data-collapse
in the ﬁgure clearly supports the one-parameter nature
of the steady state.

By formulating Eq. (1) we thus provide a comprehen-
sive description of the dynamical processes of ice crystals.
Our model improves the existing theories based on diﬀu-
sive growth (see also Ref. [Thorsteinsson et al., 1996] and
explains the saturation of the mean crystal size by means
of fundamental physical processes. This suggested inter-
play between the diﬀusion and the fragmentation in the
crystal dynamics is expected to be a central ingredient in
many other systems in nature (like in geological and per-

3

haps biological processes) and could provide a useful tool
to predict the distribution curves of fragmented pieces.
Methods
The thin sections used in determining the ice size dis-
tributions have typical thicknesses of 0.4±0.1 mm, and
ice crystals with all length scales smaller than this thick-
ness will consequently be either smoothed away when
cutting the ice or be invisible when viewed in the linear
polarizers. These small crystals will be seen as part of
the larger crystals and not as individual crystals. This
corresponds to an average increase in the sizes of the
large crystals, i.e. the lengths we measure x are equal

FIG. 4: The ﬁgure shows a data collapse of the size distribu-
tions. The lines correspond to the eight data points in Fig. 3
for late times (t > 2500 years) and the black line on top is the
steady-state solution of eq.(1). The distributions are shown in
terms of the rescaled variable ˜x = (log x − hlog xi)/σ(log(x)),
i.e. they have zero mean and standard deviation equal one.
We use ˜x in order to improve the resolution around the small-
est crystal sizes. Accordingly, the steady-state solution is also
logarithmically transformed.

to the real length ˆx plus some noise ǫ of positive mean,
x = ˆx + ǫ. We have assumed that this noise is suﬃciently
peaked around half the thin section thickness, such that
we simply put ǫ = 0.2mm. This value of ǫ has been used
in the comparisons between theoretical and experimental
values.

[12] Practically, vertically aligned rectangles, which enclose
each individual crystal, are used to estimate the sizes.
Using the horizontally measured sizes of the ice crystals
from the thin sections, one obtains similar distributions
(see also Ref. [Thorsteinsson et al., 1996]).

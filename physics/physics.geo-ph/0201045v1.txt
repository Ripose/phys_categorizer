It is known that a boundary slip velocity starts to play important role when the length scale over

which the ﬂuid velocity changes approaches the slip length, i.e. when the ﬂuid is highly conﬁned,

for example, ﬂuid ﬂow through porous rock or blood vessel capillaries. Craig et al.

[Phys. Rev.

Lett. 87, 054504-1-4 (2001)] have recently experimentally established existence of a boundary

slip in a Newtonian liquid. We investigate the eﬀect of introduction of the boundary slip into

the theory of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous medium formulated by Biot

[J. Acoust. Soc. Am.

, 28, 179-191 (1956)]. Namely, we study the eﬀect of introduction of

boundary slip upon the function F (κ) that measures the deviation from Poiseuille ﬂow friction

as a function of frequency parameter κ. By postulating phenomenological dependence of the slip

velocity upon frequency, we allow for notable deviations in the domain of intermediate frequencies,

in the behavior of F (κ) with the incorporation of the boundary slip into the model. It is known that

F (κ) crucially enters Biot’s equations which describe dynamics of ﬂuid-saturated porous solid. We,

thus, investigated consequences of the non-zero boundary slip by calculating the phase velocities

and attenuation coeﬃcients of the both rotational and dilatational waves with the variation of

frequency. In eﬀect, the formulated model will allow to ﬁt theory to experimental seismic data

in circumstances when Biot’s theory fails, as the introduction of phenomenological dependence of

the slip velocity upon frequency, which is based on robust physical arguments, adds an additional

degree of freedom to the model. This would yield three-fold beneﬁts: (A) Better agreement of

theory with an experimental data since the parametric space of the model is larger (includes eﬀects

of boundary slip); (B) Possibility to identify types of porous medium and physical situations where

boundary slip is important; (C) Constrain model parameters that are related to the boundary slip.

INTRODUCTION

It has been a common practice in the ﬂuid dynamics to assume that when a ﬂuid ﬂows

over an interface with a solid, the ﬂuid molecules adjacent to the solid have zero relative

velocity with the respect to solid. So far, this widely used assumption, known as ”no-slip

boundary condition”, has been successfully applied to the theoretical modeling of almost

all macroscopic experiments. As relevantly noticed by Craig et al.

[1], the success of this

assumption does not reﬂect its accuracy, but rather insensitivity of the experiment to a

partial-slip boundary condition. It is known that the boundary slip becomes important only

when the length scale over which the ﬂuid velocity changes approaches the slip length, that

is the distance behind the interface at which the ﬂuid velocity extrapolates to zero, i.e. when

the ﬂuid becomes highly conﬁned, e.g., blood ﬂow through capillaries or ﬂuid ﬂow through

natural porous rock. Recently, Craig at al. [1] presented a convincing experimental evidence

of a boundary slip in a Newtonian liquid. Craig et al. performed direct measurements of

the hydrodynamic drainage forces, which show a clear evidence of boundary slip. They

found that the boundary slip is a function of the ﬂuid viscosity and the shear rate. These

results have important implications for the blood dynamics in capillaries, the permeability

of porous media, and lubrication of nano-machines. For example, results of Craig et al.

suggest that red blood cells squeeze through narrow capillary walls more easily and induce

less shear stress on capillary walls due to the boundary slip. Also, in oil production industry,

the residual oil is diﬃcult to produce due to its naturally low mobility. Thus, the enhanced

oil recovery operations are used to increase production. It has been experimentally proven

that there is a substantial increase in the net ﬂuid ﬂow through a porous medium if the

latter is treated with elastic waves [2, 3, 4, 5]. We may conjecture that the elastic waves via

the pore wall vibration cause boundary slip of the residual oil droplets, which likewise red

blood cells, squeeze through pores with less resistance, eﬀectively increasing permeability of

the porous medium.

A quantitative theory of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid

has been formulated in the classic paper by Biot [6]. After its appearance, this theory has

seen numerous modiﬁcations and generalizations. One of the major ﬁndings of Biot’s work

was that there was a breakdown in Poiseuille ﬂow above a certain characteristic frequency

speciﬁc to this ﬂuid-saturated porous material. Biot theoretically studied this breakdown

3

by considering the ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid in a tube with longitudinally oscillating walls under

an oscillatory pressure gradient. Biot’s theory can be used to describe interaction of ﬂuid-

saturated porous solid with sound for a classic Newtonian ﬂuid assuming no-slip boundary

condition at the pore walls holds. However, in the light of recent experimental results of

Craig et al.

[1], revision of the classic theory is needed in order to investigate novelties

bought about by the boundary slip. Biot’s theory has been a successful tool for interpreting

the experimental data for decades, but there are circumstances when it fails. Thus, we

conjecture that in such situations, apart from other yet unknown eﬀects, non-zero boundary

slip eﬀect maybe responsible for the deviations between the theory and experiment. This

justiﬁes our aim to formulate a model that would account for the boundary slip.

In the section II we formulate theoretical basis of our model and in section III we present

our numerical results. In the section IV we conclude with the discussion of the results.

In our model we study a Newtonian ﬂuid ﬂowing in a cylindrical tube, which mimics

a natural pore, whose walls are oscillating longitudinally and the ﬂuid is subject to an

oscillatory pressure gradient. We give analytical solutions of the problem in the frequency

Now, let u be a velocity of the wall of the tube which oscillates in time as e−iωt. The

ﬂow of ﬂuid in a cylindrical tube with longitudinally oscillating walls can be described by a

singe component of the velocity, namely, its z-component vz (z axis is along the centerline

of the tube). We use cylindrical coordinate system (r, φ, z) in treatment of the problem. We
introduce the relative velocity U1 as U1 = vz −

Note, that F (κ) measures the deviation from Poiseuille ﬂow friction as a function of fre-

easily recovered from Eq.(7) by putting ¯Us →

So far, we did not specify ¯Us, however there are certain physical constraints it should

0 for all κ’s.

(7)

(A) Authors of Ref. [1] demonstrated that the slip length (which, in fact, is proportional

to the slip velocity) is a function of the approach rate and they showed why several previ-

ous careful measurement of conﬁned liquids have not observed evidence for boundary slip.

Under the low approach rates employed in previous measurements slip length is zero and

no-slip boundary condition is applicable. Experiments reported in Ref. [1] were performed

when half-sphere approached a plane with liquid placed in-between at diﬀerent approach

rates. However, we should clearly realize what term ”approach rate” means in the context

of Biot’s theory: Biot investigated ﬂuid ﬂow in the cylindrical tube whose walls are har-
monically oscillating in the longitudinal direction as x(t) = Ae−iωt, therefore if similar to

Ref.[1] experiment would be done for the oscillation tube, the ”approach rate” would be the

amplitude of ˙x(t), i.e.

iωA. Thus, when ω

0, ¯Us should also tend to zero.

Thus, ﬂuid at high frequencies behaves as an ideal (non-viscous) pore ﬂuid, which allows for

→ ∞

from Ref.[1] closely we should understand that the authors measured ascending part where

slip length increases with the increase of the approach rate. Since, the viscous eﬀects should

be negligible compared to the inertial eﬀects for large approach rates, there must be also a

descending part – clearly slip length (or the same as slip velocity) cannot grow inﬁnitely as

6

approach rate increases. Viscous eﬀects should give in to the inertial eﬀects and ﬂuid should

behave an ideal ﬂuid allowing for an arbitrary slip.

Based upon the above two physical arguments we conclude that ¯Us should be a smooth

function which tends to zero when ω (or the same as κ) tends to both zero and
we postulate following phenomenological expression for ¯Us

This function has a maximum at κ∗ =

”weight” of the boundary slip eﬀect into the solution. Putting, ξ = 0 this way would easily

allow us to recover no-slip case, while the increase of ξ we would be able to trace eﬀect of

non-zero slip onto the all physical quantities. We plot this function in Fig. 1 for A = 25 and

ξ = 1.

It is worthwhile to mention that, at ﬁrst glance, it seems that non-zero boundary slip,

which appears at ”high approach rates”, should be attributed to the non-linear eﬀects.

However, thorough interpretation of the experimental results of Ref. [1], in the context of

the oscillatory tube (see points (A) and (B) above) allows us to conclude that the non-zero

boundary slip can be also incorporated into the linear Biot’s theory.

Next, we plot both Fr(κ) = Re[F (κ)] and Fi(κ) =

Im[F (κ)] in Fig. 2 for the three

−

cases: when there is no boundary slip (ξ = 0), and ξ = 0.2, 0.4. We gather from the plot

that the ξ = 0 is identical to Fig. 4 from Ref.[6] as it should be. However, we also notice a

noticeable diﬀerence from the classic case when ξ is non-zero in the intermediate frequencies
domain. Of course, according to our deﬁnition of the phenomenological form of ¯Us(κ), even

for non-zero ξ (non-zero boundary slip), when κ

Since in our phenomenological model we allow for the deviations in the intermediate fre-

quency domain, it is easy to foresee that these will have an impact on all of the predictions

of the Biot’s theory precisely in that frequency range. Namely, all observable quantities

predicted by the Biot’s theory, such as phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients of the

both rotational and dilatational waves will be aﬀected by the introduction of boundary slip

into the model in the intermediate frequency range.

Biot [6] showed that the general equations which govern propagation of rotational and

dilatational high-frequency waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous medium are the same as in the

low-frequency range provided the viscosity is replaced by its eﬀective value as a function of

frequency. In practice, it means replacing the resistance coeﬃcient b by bF (κ).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In order to investigate the novelties brought about into classical Biot’s theory of prop-

agation of elastic waves in porous medium [6] by the inclusion of boundary slip, we have

studied the full parameter space of the problem.

In all forthcoming results, we calculate phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients for

the case 1 from Table I taken from Ref. [6], which is σ11 = 0.610, σ22 = 0.305, σ12 = 0.043,

γ11 = 0.500, γ22 = 0.500, γ12 = 0, z1 = 0.812, and z2 = 1.674.

We calculated normalized phase velocity of the plane rotational waves, vr/Vr, and the

attenuation coeﬃcient Lr/xa using our more general expression for F (κ) (which takes into

account non-zero boundary slip) given by Eq.(7).

In Fig. 3 we plot phase velocity vr/Vr as a function of frequency for the three cases: the

solid curve corresponds to ξ = 0 (no boundary slip), while long-dashed and short-dashed

curves correspond to ξ = 0.2 and ξ = 0.4 respectively. Note that the ξ = 0 case perfectly

reproduces the curve 1 in Fig. 5 from Ref.[6]. For ξ = 0.2 and 0.4 we notice a deviation from

the classic behavior in the form of an increase of phase velocity in the domain of intermediate

frequencies.

Fig. 4 shows the attenuation coeﬃcient Lr/xa of the rotational wave as a function of

frequency for the three values of ξ: the solid curve corresponds to ξ = 0 (no boundary

slip), while long-dashed and short-dashed curves represent the cases ξ = 0.2 and ξ = 0.4

10

respectively. Note that ξ = 0 case coincides with curve 1 in Fig. 6 from Ref.[6]. We observe

that, in the intermediate frequency range, with increase of boundary slip our model yields

lower values of the attenuation coeﬃcient than in the classic no-slip case.

We also calculated normalized phase velocities of the plane dilatational waves, vI/Vc and

vII/Vc, and the attenuation coeﬃcients Lc/xI and Lc/xII using our more general expression

for F (κ) given by Eq. (7).

In Figs. 5 and 6 are similar to Fig. 3 except that now we plot phase velocities vI/Vc and

vII/Vc as a function of frequency. Note that the solid curves on the both graphs reproduce

curves 1 in Figs. 11 and 12 from Ref. [6]. We gather from the graph that introduction of

the non-zero boundary slip leads to increase of vI/Vc, while vII/Vc decreases in the in the

domain of intermediate frequencies as boundary slip, ξ, increases.

In Figs. 7 and 8 we plot the attenuation coeﬃcients Lc/xI and Lc/xII in a similar manner

as in Fig. 4. Again we observe that the ξ = 0 case reproduces curves 1 in Figs. 13 and 14

from Ref.[6]. We gather from Figs. 7 and 8 that introduction of the non-zero boundary slip

yields smaller than in the no boundary slip case values of the attenuation coeﬃcients for

both types of the dilatational waves in the domain of intermediate frequencies.

It is worthwhile to note that for no-zero ξ the asymptotic behavior of the elastic waves

in the f /fc → ∞
Biot [6]. This is a consequence of the assumptions of our phenomenological model, which is

0 limit is identical to the classic behavior established by

as well as f /fc →

based on robust physical arguments.

IV. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have studied the eﬀect of introduction of the boundary slip in the theory

of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid originally formulated by

Biot [6]. Biot’s theory does not account for boundary slip eﬀect, however, the boundary slip

becomes important when the length scale over which the ﬂuid velocity changes approaches

the slip length, i.e. when the ﬂuid is highly conﬁned, for instance, ﬂuid ﬂow through porous

rock or blood vessel capillaries. In the light of recent convincing experimental evidence of a

boundary slip in a Newtonian liquid [1], it is necessary to take into account this eﬀect into

the Biot’s theory where appropriate. We have studied the eﬀect of introduction of boundary

slip upon the function F (κ) that measures the deviation from Poiseuille ﬂow friction as a

11

function of frequency parameter κ. This function crucially enters Biot’s equations which

describe dynamics of ﬂuid-saturated porous solid. Therefore, a revision of Biot’s theory

was needed in order to incorporate boundary slip eﬀect into the all measurable predictions

of this theory such as phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients of the both rotational

and dilatational waves. We have performed such analysis, and in summary, we found that

the introduction of the non-zero boundary slip into the Biot’s theory of propagation of the

elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid results in

•

•

•

the an increase, as compared to the no-slip limiting case, of the phase velocities of both

rotational waves (vr/Vr) and dilatational wave of the ﬁrst kind (vI/Vc) in the domain

of intermediate frequencies. On contrary, the phase velocity of the dilatational wave

of the second kind (vII/Vc) experiences a decrease as compared to the no-slip limiting

case in the domain of intermediate frequencies.

in the domain of intermediate frequencies the attenuation coeﬃcients of both the ro-

tational (Lr/xa) and dilatational waves (Lc/xI and Lc/xII) are decreased as compared

to the no-slip limiting case as the boundary slip increases .

behavior of all physical quantities which describe the elastic waves in the asymptotic

limits of both small and large frequencies is not modiﬁed by the introduction of the

non-zero boundary slip. The deviation occurs only in the domain of intermediate

frequencies.

The investigation of properties of elastic waves is important for a number of applications.

The knowledge of phase velocities and attenuation coeﬃcients of elastic waves is necessary,

for example, to guide the oil-ﬁeld exploration applications, acoustic stimulation of oil pro-

ducing ﬁelds (in order to increase the amount of recovered residual oil), and the acoustic

clean up of contaminated aquifers [2, 3, 4, 5]. Therefore, our results would be useful for

various applications in oil production as well as in ecology.

We would like to close this paper with the following remark: From the recent experimental

results of Ref.[1] we gathered that there are physical situations were the no-slip boundary

condition becomes invalid. We have formulated a phenomenological model of elastic waves

in the ﬂuid-saturated porous medium based on Biot’s linear theory and certain physically
justiﬁed assumptions on the variation of boundary slip velocity with frequency, ¯Us(κ). Since,

12

there are no experimental measurements of ¯Us(κ), for a cylindrical tube, on which ”Biot-

like” theory relies, there is a certain freedom of choice, which could be used to obtain better

ﬁt of experimental data with the theory in cases where classic Biot’s theory fails to do so.

The next step should be to ﬁnd such experimental data and achieve the best ﬁt with this

modiﬁed model. This, on the other hand, would yield three-fold beneﬁts:

Better agreement of theory with an experimental data, since, the parametric space of

the model is larger (includes eﬀects of boundary slip).

Possibility to identify types of porous medium and physical situations where boundary

slip is important.

Constrain model parameters that are related to the boundary slip.

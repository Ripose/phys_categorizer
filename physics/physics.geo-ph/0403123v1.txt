The “Yin-Yang Grid”: An Overset Grid in Spherical Geometry

Akira Kageyama∗ and Tetsuya Sato
Earth Simulator Center, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Yokohama 236-0001, Japan

A new kind of overset grid, named Yin-Yang grid, for spherical geometry is proposed. The Yin-
Yang grid is composed of two identical component grids that are combined in a complemental way
to cover a spherical surface with partial overlap on their boundaries. Each component grid is a
low latitude part of the latitude-longitude grid. Therefore the grid spacing is quasi-uniform and
the metric tensors are simple and analytically known. One can directly apply mathematical and
numerical resources that have been written in the spherical polar coordinates or latitude-longitude
grid. The complemental combination of the two identical component grids enables us to make
eﬃcient and concise programs. Simulation codes for geodynamo and mantle convection simulations
using ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme based on the Yin-Yang grid are developed and tested. The Yin-Yang
grid is suitable for massively parallel computers.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Since the Earth is composed of spherical layers, computer simulations of the Earth’s interior, such as geodynamo and
mantle convection simulations, need eﬃcient spatial discretization schemes in spherical shell geometry. The spectral
method [15] has been the major tool in the geodynamo simulation; all six codes [9, 11, 42, 46, 47] in the benchmark
test in Christensen et al. [10] and other codes [e.g., 20, 28] use the spherical harmonics expansion method in the
horizontal space. However, the importance of non-spectral (or point-based) approaches in the dynamo simulation
is now increasingly recognized to simulate more realistic geodynamo regime with smaller Ekman numbers [7]. The
pursuit of point-based approaches started earlier in the mantle convection simulations, because the mantle’s intense
spatial variation of viscosity and the phase transitions makes the spectral approach not ﬁt to the problem. Although
the spectral method for the mantle convection prospered in 1980s and 90s [2, 16, 18, 30, 49], the ﬁnite element method
is rapidly growing in this ﬁeld [1, 4, 39, 45, 50]. There are also a couple of codes that uses the ﬁnite element method in
the geodynamo simulation [7, 31]. The ﬁnite diﬀerence or ﬁnite volume method is applied for the mantle convection
by Hernlund and Tackley [19], Iwase [21], Ratcliﬀ et al. [38]. The ﬁnite diﬀerence method has been used for the core
convection and the geodynamo simulation by the authors from 1990s [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 34], in which the

latitude-longitude grids in the spherical polar coordinates is used with radius r (ri ≤
and longitude φ (0
φ < 2π). Since the ﬁnite diﬀerence method enables us to make highly optimized programs for
massively parallel computers, especially massively parallel vector supercomputers like the Earth Simulator [17], we
further exploit the possibility of the ﬁnite diﬀerence method for simulations in spherical shell geometry by improving
the base grid system.

It is known that the latitude-longitude grid has two numerical problems; the coordinate singularity and the grid
convergence near the poles. Since the coordinate singularity is not a real singularity (the pole is not singular point of
physical functions), one can solve the basic equations on the poles by applying the l’Hospital’s rule on the pole grids
[e.g., 26]. The computational cost for this pole grid solver is negligible.

The problem of the grid convergence is more serious. In order to relax the severe restriction on the time step,
one has to apply a ﬁlter so that the grid spacing on the sphere becomes eﬀectively quasi-uniform. The amount of
information abandoned by the ﬁlter is estimated by the number of grid points that are eﬀectively present and that
actually present in the computational space; suppose one has a latitude-longitude grid of a spherical surface of unit
radius with inter mesh angles ∆ in both colatitude (θ) and longitude (φ). The azimuthal grid spacing, which is ∆ in
the equator, converges in higher latitudes. When a ﬁlter enables an eﬀectively quasi-uniform grid with spacing ∆ on

36% of the latitude-longitude grid, is abandoned in vain by the ﬁltering at each
simulation step. In addition to this computational ineﬃciency, the ﬁlter has non-negligible computational costs. In
our geodynamo simulation code using latitude-longitude grid, in which a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based ﬁltering
procedure is applied, the ﬁlter routine can take more than 30% of the total execution time.

Note that the above problem of the grid redundancy in the latitude-longitude grid comes only from the region of
high latitudes. The remaining part of the latitude-longitude grid—the low latitude region–has rather desirable feature
for numerical simulations; it is an orthogonal grid, it has simple metric tensors, and it has quasi-uniform grid spacings.
This observation leads us to the idea of a new spherical grid proposed in this paper.

Since there is no grid mesh that is orthogonal all over the spherical surface and, at the same time, free of coordinate
singularity or grid convergence, we decompose the spherical surface into subregions. The decomposition, or dissection,
enables us to cover each subregion by a grid system that is individually orthogonal and singularity-free. This divide-
and-rule approach has been used with good success in the computational aerodynamics that incorporates complex
geometry of aircraft’s body with wings/stores/blades.

The dissection of the computational domain generates internal border or boundary between the subregions. There
are two diﬀerent approaches to handle the internal boundaries. One is the patched grid method [37] and the other is
the overset grid method [8]. In the patched grid approach, the subdomains contact one another without any overlap
on their borders. In the overset grid method, on the other hand, the subdomains partially overlap one another on
their borders. The overset grid is also called as overlaid grid, or composite overlapping grid, or Chimera grid [44].
The validity and importance of the overset approach in the aerodynamical calculations was pointed out by Steger
[43]. Since then this method is widely used in this ﬁeld. It is now one of the most important grid techniques in the
computational aerodynamics; for example, whole aircraft with wing and store [32], tiltrotor aircraft [33], Boeing 747
[6, 40], Space Shuttle [5], helicopter [13], and others.

In the computational geosciences, the idea of the overset grid approach appeared rather early. Phillips proposed
a kind of composite grid in 1950’s to solve partial diﬀerential equations on a hemisphere, in which the high latitude
region of the latitude-longitude grid is “capped” by another grid system that is constructed by a stereographic
projection to a plane on the north pole [3, 35, 36]. After a long intermission, the overset grid method seems to attract
growing interest in geoscience these days. The “cubed sphere” [41] is an overset grid that covers a spherical surface
with six component grids that correspond to six faces of a sphere. The “cubed sphere” is recently applied to the
mantle convection simulation [19]. In the atmospheric research, other kind of spherical overset grid is used in a global
circulation model [12], in which the spherical surface is covered by two component grids—improved stereographic
projection grids—in northern and souther hemispheres that overlap in the equator. A successful test of 100-day
integration of global circulation is demonstrated with this overset grid.

The overset grid proposed in this paper is named “Yin-Yang grid” after the symbol for yin and yang of Chinese
philosophy of complementarity. The Yin-Yang grid is composed of two identical and complemental component grids.
Compared with other spherical overset grids, the Yin-Yang grid is simple in its geometry and metric tensors. A
remarkable feature of this overset grid is that the two identical component grids are combined in a complemental way
with a special symmetry.

II. BASIC YIN-YANG GRID

The Yin-Yang grid in its most basic shape is shown in Fig. 1. It has two component grids that are geometrically
identical (exactly the same shape and size); see Fig. 1(a). We call the two component grids “Yin grid” (or n-grid)
and “Yang grid” (or e-grid). They are combined to cover a spherical surface with partial overlap on their borders as
shown in Fig. 1(b). Each component grid is in fact a part of the latitude-longitude grid: A component grid, say Yin
grid, is deﬁned in the spherical polar coordinates by

where δ is a small buﬀer, which is proportional to grid spacing, required for minimum overlap in the overset method-

ology (see Fig. 1(b)). In the limit of inﬁnitesimal grid (δ
radius is given by
sin θdθ
2.12π, i.e., roughly a half of the whole spherical surface (2π).
Another component grid, Yang grid, is deﬁned by the same rule of eq. (1) but in diﬀerent spherical coordinates that
is perpendicular to the original one; see the green- and blue-colored spherical mesh in Fig. 2. The axis of the Yang
grid’s coordinates (blue mesh in Fig. 2), is located in a equator of the Yin grid’s coordinates (green mesh in Fig. 2).
The relation between Yin coordinates and Yang coordinates is denoted in the Cartesian coordinates by

complemental relation between Yin and Yang.
In the spherical coordinates, eq. (2) reads

where (rn, θn, φn), and (re, θe, φe) are the coordinates of Yin and Yang, respectively. The idea of two perpendicular
spherical coordinates is used in the global ocean simulation [14] to avoid the grid convergence in the Arctic, however,
the second spherical coordinates is used in a sort of auxiliary way for the main (usual) spherical polar coordinates in
their method. On the other hand, we make the best use of the symmetry between two coordinates.

An important feature of the Yin-Yang grid as a spherical overset grid is that the two component grids are identical
and their geometrical positions are complemental. This enables us to make concise programs: Suppose a grid point
(θn
k ) on Yin grid’s horizontal border at index position (j, k) (e.g., j = 1). Its value should be determined by an
interpolation from its neighbor points, or stencils, of Yang grid with interpolation coeﬃcients that are determined by
relative position of (θn
k ) in the stencils. Note that exactly the same interpolation coeﬃcients and relative stencils
are used to set the value of corresponding grid point (θe
k) at (j, k) of Yang’s border, since the geometrical relations
between Yin grid and Yang grid are symmetric. In other words, we can make use of one interpolation routine for two
times (for Yin grid and for Yang grid) to set the horizontal boundary conditions. Note also that the metric tensors at
a bulk grid point at (j, k) of Yin grid is a function of its position (θn
k ) in Yin’s coordinates, and the metric tensors
at corresponding point (θe
j , φe
k) in Yang grid are exactly the same. Therefore we can call one subroutine of ﬂuid solver
and others for two times for Yin grid and Yang grid.

Another advantage of the Yin-Yang grid resides in the fact that the component grid is nothing but the (part of )
latitude-longitude grid. We can directly deal with the equations to be solved with the vector form in the usual spherical
polar coordinates,
. The analytical form of metric tensors are familiar in the spherical coordinates. We
can directly code the basic equations in the program as they are formulated in the spherical coordinates. We can
make use of various resources of mathematical formulas, program libraries, and tools that have been developed in the
spherical polar coordinates.

To conclude this section, we point out that the construction of three-dimensional Yin-Yang grid for spherical shell
geometry is straightforward, by piling up the basic (two-dimensional) Yin-Yang grids in radial direction. See Fig. 3.

III. VECTOR TRANSFORMATION FORMULA BETWEEN YIN AND YANG GRIDS

Following the general overset methodology [e.g., 8], interpolations are applied on the boundary of each component
grid to set the boundary values, or internal boundary condition. When one deals with scalar variables, the interpolation

When we see the component grid of the basic Yin-Yang grid shown in Fig. 1 in the Mercator projection, it is a
rectangle; the four corners intrude most into the other component grid (see Fig. 1(b)). Even if the grid mesh is
0, the overlapping area has still non-zero ratio of about 6%;
taken to be inﬁnitesimal, i.e., ∆θ = ∆φ
(3/√2π
0.061. This overlapped area can be minimized by modifying the component grid’s shape from
the rectangle. It is obvious that a Yin-Yang grid with minimum overlap region can be constructed by a division, or
dissection, with a closed curve on a sphere that cuts the sphere into two identical parts. There are inﬁnite number of
such dissections of a sphere. Fig. 5 shows two examples among them. When we cut along the curve that is colored
with red and blue in Fig. 5(a) or (b), we get two separated parts of the spherical surface that are identical. Although,
it is not apparent that the two parts separated by the blue-red curve in each panel of Fig. 5 are identical from this
ﬁgure, the corresponding three-dimensional view (Fig. 6) would show more convincingly. The cutoﬀ curve of Fig. 6(a)
reminds us a baseball, while the cutoﬀ curve of Fig. 6(b) resembles a cube.

→

Based on these spherical dissections, we can construct spherical overset grids with two identical component grids
that has minimum overlapping area; Fig. 7 shows a Yin-Yang grid that corresponds to the baseball type dissection
of a sphere (panels labeled (a) in Figs. 5 and 6). Fig. 8 is for the cube type dissection (panels (b) of Figs. 5 and 6).
When minimizing the computational cost is strongly required, the Yin-Yang grid of the baseball type (Fig. 7) or cube
type (Fig. 8) would be worth trying.

However, the non-rectangle geometries of the component grid of Fig. 7 or Fig. 8 imply that special cares should be
taken to mask some grid points. The number of the mask is the same for both the Yin-Yang grids of Figs. 7 and 8,
since the non-masked area of a component grid is just a half of the spherical surface (2π) in the limit of the negligibly
small overlap area.

IV. SUMMARY

For numerical simulations of the Earth’s interior, we have developed a new spherical grid based on the overset grid
methodology. Our motivation is to devise an spherical grid system that is suitable for ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme on
massively parallel vector supercomputers. The spherical overset grid proposed in this paper, named Yin-Yang grid,
is composed of two component grids. They have the same shape and size and combined to cover a spherical surface
with partial overlap on their borders. Each component grid is nothing but low latitude region of the usual latitude-
longitude grid; it is 90◦ about the equator and 270◦ in the longitude. Therefore the grid spacing is quasi-uniform and
the metric tensors are simple and analytically known. One can directly apply mathematical and numerical resources
that have been written in the spherical polar coordinates or latitude-longitude grid system. Since the two component
grids are identical and combined in a complemental way, various routines for solvers and interpolation can be recycled
for two times for each component grid at every simulation time step.

We have developed ﬁnite diﬀerence codes of the mantle convection and dynamo simulation using the basic Yin-Yang
grid for spherical shell geometry (see Figs. 1 and 3). We have conﬁrmed that the Yin-Yang grid is successfully applied
to both cases. The mantle convection code is newly developed from scratch. Details of the code and simulation
results are reported in other paper [48]; we solved the time development of thermal convection motion in a spherical
shell of a Boussinesq ﬂuid with inﬁnite Prandtl number for uniform and variable viscosity cases. We have performed
standard benchmark tests of the mantle convection [39], and conﬁrmed that the results of our Yin-Yang mantle
convection code successfully reproduced previously published results. The numerical values of Nusselt number and
the mean velocity coincides with other benchmark values within a few percent or even better [48]. We have also
applied the Yin-Yang grid to the geodynamo simulation code. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with
ﬁnite viscosity, thermal diﬀusivity, and electrical conductivity are solved. The Yin-Yang geodynamo code has been
converted from our previous geodynamo code which was based on the latitude-longitude grid. We found that the
code conversion was straightforward and rather easy since the base grid is common. We could reproduce our previous
(latitude-longitude grid based) results of geodynamo simulation by our newly developed Yin-Yang geodynamo code
with shorter calculation time. The details of the code will be reported in other paper.

The Yin-Yang grid is suitable for parallel programming. Since the number of the component grid is two, we are
naturally lead to make parallel programs with domain decomposition of even number: We ﬁrst decompose whole
computational region into two—Yin component and Yang component—then apply further domain decomposition in
each component.

Finally, we point out another possible spherical overset grid that has an odd number of component grids. Fig. 9
shows a spherical overset grid that consists of three identical component grids. In this case, the component grid is

deﬁned as a part (about 1/3) of the spherical surface by (π/4

FIG. 5: Curves that divide a spherical surface into two identical areas. If one cuts along the blue-red curve of the panel (a) or
(b), the spherical surface is divided into two parts (denoted by Yin and Yang in the pictures) that are exactly the same shape
and size. The blue part of the curve and red part of the curve are in the complemental relation; The blue curve of Yin is red
curve of Yang, and vice versa.

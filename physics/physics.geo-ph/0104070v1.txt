Abstract

Basic properties of the mid-latitude large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances

(LS TIDs) during the maximum phase of a strong magnetic storm of 6-8 April 2000

are shown. Total electron content (TEC) variations were studied by using data from

GPS receivers located in Russia and Central Asia. The nightglow response to this

storm at mesopause and termospheric altitudes was also measured by optical instru-

ments FENIX located at the observatory of the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics,
(51.9◦ N, 103.0◦ E) and MORTI located at the observatory of the Institute of Iono-
sphere (43.2◦ N, 77.0◦ E). Observations of the O (557.7 nm, 630.0 nm, 360-410 nm,

and 720-830 nm) emissions originating from atmospheric layers centered at altitudes

of 90 km, 97 km, and 250 km were carried out at Irkutsk and of the O2 (866.5 nm)

emission originating from an atmospheric layer centered at altitude of 95 km was car-

ried out at Almaty. Variations of the f0F 2 and virtual altitude of the F2 layer were

measured at Almaty as well. An analysis of data was performed for the time interval

17.00-21.00 UT comprising a maximum of the Dst derivative. Results have shown

that the storm-induced solitary large-scale wave with duration of 1 hour and with
the front width of 5000 km moved equatorward with the velocity of 200 ms−1 to a

distance of no less than 1000 km. The TEC disturbance, basically displaying an elec-

tron content depression in the maximum of the F2 region, reveals a good correlation

with growing nightglow emission, the temporal shift between the TEC and emission

variation maxima being different for different altitudes.

1 Introduction

In the course of strong geomagnetic storms, signiﬁcant changes in main structural elements of the

magnetosphere and ionosphere occur. Geophysical manifestations of extremely strong magnetic

storms are of particular interest because these storms take place relatively rarely (no more than

4 events during an 11-year solar cycle), and therefore the representative statistics of the whole

complex of interactive processes in the ”magnetosphere- ionosphere” system is lacking.

We have now reached a new quality level in studying these phenomena because a large number

of ionospheric and magnetospheric parameters are continuously monitored by various ground-

based and space facilities. A new era in the remote ionospheric monitoring was opened up with

the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) now comprising more than 800 world-wide

two-frequency GPS receivers whose data are available through the INTERNET.

Large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (LS TIDs) with a period of 1-2 hours and a

wavelength of 1000-2000 km constitute the most signiﬁcant mid-latitude consequence of magnetic

storms. Many papers including review papers (HUNSUCKER, 1982; HOCKE AND SCHLEGEL,

1996) have been published. LS TIDs are considered to be a manifestation of internal atmospheric

gravity waves (AGWs) excited by sources in the polar regions of the northern and southern hemi-

spheres. Thus, the study of LS TIDs provides important information on auroral processes under

quiet and disturbed geomagnetic conditions.

AFRAIMOVICH et al. (2000) were the ﬁrst to develop a technique for determining the LS

TIDs parameters based on calculations of spatial and temporal gradients of total electron content

(TEC) measured by three spaced GPS receivers (a GPS array). This technique was employed to

determine the LS TIDs parameters in the course of a strong magnetic storm of 25 September 1998.

It was shown that a large-scale solitary wave excited in the auroral region with a duration of about

1 hour and the front width of 3700 km, at least, traveled equatorward to a distance no less than

2000-3000 km with the average velocity of about 300 m/sec.

Another interesting consequence of strong magnetic storms is low-latitude auroras. The global

response to the magnetic storm of the year 1989 was studied by YEH ET AL. (1994). Low-latitude

auroras were observed in the northern and southern hemispheres. A long-term electron density

depression in the mid-latitude ionosphere is the most pronounced effect of the a storm. During the

maximum phase of the storm, the zone of disturbances extended to geomagnetic latitudes of less
than 10◦ causing a temporal depression of the equatorial anomaly.

There appeared many papers on the behavior of nightglow emissions of the upper atmosphere

2

during geomagnetic disturbances (CHAPMAN, 1957; ISHIMOTO ET AL, 1986; TINSLEY, 1979;

TORR, 1984). Several peculiarities in spectra of upper atmosphere emissions at the middle and

low latitudes during strong geomagnetic perturbations allow them to be classiﬁed as ”mid- and

low-latitude auroras” (RASSOUL ET AL., 1993) distinguishing from the ”common” aurora at
polar latitudes. The differences between auroras include the appearance of the N +

2 emission in

bands of the ﬁrst negative system of mid-latitude spectra, a signiﬁcant increase of the atomic oxy-

gen (630.0 nm) emission, and the predominance of emissions of atomic ion lines above these of

molecular bands.

RASSOUL ET AL. (1993) classiﬁed several types of low-latitude auroras in relation to the type

of bombarding particles (electrons, ions, neutral particles), dominating emissions, localization,

and typical temporal scales. Many observations revealed several types of simultaneously existing

auroras caused by the bombardment of fast electrons and mixture heavy particles. At mid-latitudes

during moderate geomagnetic perturbations, 630 nm emission variations with periods ranging

from 0.5 to 2 hours were recorded (MISSAWA ET AL., 1984: SAHAL ET AL, 1988). Mid-

latitude auroras occurring in the course of very strong magnetic storms (Kp ≥ 8-9, Dst ≥ 300

nT) are of the particular interest because the number of observations with optical instruments was

limited.

Although mid-latitude ionospheric storms have been studied during several decades, there is

no complete explanation of their effects because of the small number of sounding facilities and

their low spatial and temporal resolutions of an ionosonde, a incoherent scatter radar and optical

devices. Moreover, in contrast to polar latitudes, a small number of observations were carried

out at mid-latitudes simultaneously by radio and optical techniques which supplement each other

because they allow their shortcomings to be compensated and the reliability of interpretation of

phenomena to be increased.

The objective of this paper is to study the response of the mid-latitude ionosphere to the strong

magnetic storm of 6-8 April 2000 by using data of simultaneous radio and optical observations

in Russia and Central Asia, main attention being paid to LS TIDs with a characteristic temporal

period on the order of 1 hour. Small-scale disturbance, whose increase in intensity is related to the

shift of the auroral region toward mid-latitudes, will be the objective of a next study.

Section 2 gives a description of the state of the geomagnetic ﬁeld on 6-8 April 2000, and the

scheme of the experiment. The features of LS TIDs obtained on the basis of TEC and optical and

ionosonde data are described in Sections 3 and 4. Section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the

results.

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD ON 6-8 APRIL

2000, AND SCHEME OF THE EXPERIMENT

Fig. 1 shows the K-index (a), the Dst -variations of the geomagnetic ﬁeld, and the variations

of the H-component of the geomagnetic ﬁeld at Almaty (c) and Irkutsk (f) in the course of the

strong magnetic storm of 6-8 April 2000. This storm was characterized by a pronounced sudden

commencement (SSC) that started at 1642 UT. At the maximum of the storm, the K-index achieved

the value 8, and a K-index diurnal sum of 48 was observed. At 1600 UT on 6 April, the Dst

amplitude increased fast to 0, but after that it began to decrease, and at 2400 UT it reached the

value -319 nT. After that, the recovery phase continued into 8 April. In Fig. 1, the dashed vertical

lines show SSC and tmin=20.00 UT corresponding to the maximum value of the time derivative

of Dst (dDst/dt).

Fig. 2 shows the scheme of the experiment in the geographical system of coordinates. The

positions of the GPS receivers are denoted by heavy dots, and their names are given. On the upper

scale, the values of the local time (LT) for a certain longitudinal interval corresponding to the

relative time of the arrival of the LS TID at middle latitudes at 19.00 UT are plotted (Section 3).

Diamonds and slant letters show the positions of optical instruments MORTI (near Almaty and

station SELE) and FENIX (near Irkutsk and station IRKT). Data of an Almaty standard ionosonde

were also used in this paper.

GPS receivers are distributed all over the world with a different density, and the region consid-

ered in this paper comprises only 11 stations whose coordinates are listed in Table 1. Parameters

of LS TIDs are considered to have been determined with a proper reliability when the distances be-

tween GPS receivers exceed the wavelength of TIDs (about 1000 km). The array of GPS receivers

used in the experiment satisﬁed this requirement.

3 PARAMETERS OF LS TIDs MEASURED BY GPS RECEIVERS AND THE ALMATY

IONOSONDE

The GPS technique makes it possible to determine the parameters of TIDs from the phase vari-

ations at two carrier frequencies measured at spaced sites. Methods of calculating the relative

TEC variations from measurements of the ionosphere-induced change in the phase path of GPS

signals were described in detail in several papers (HOFMANN-WELLENHOF ET AL., 1992;

AFRAIMOVICH ET AL., 1998, 2000). Here we reproduce the resulting expression for phase

[(L1λ1 − L2λ2) + const + nL],

(1)

where L1λ1 and L2λ2 are additional paths of the radio signal caused by the phase delay in the

ionosphere, (m); L1 and L2 represent the number of phase rotations at the frequencies f1 and

f2; λ1 and λ2 stand for the corresponding wavelengths, (m); const is the unknown initial phase

ambiguity, (m); and nL are errors in determining the phase path, (m).

For this type of measurements with the sampling rate of 30 seconds, the error of TEC mea-
surements does not exceed 1014 m−2, the initial value of TEC being unknown (HOFMANN-

WELLENHOF et al., 1992). This makes it possible to detect irregularities and waves in the iono-
sphere over a wide band of amplitudes (up to 10−4 of the diurnal TEC variation) and periods (from
24 hours to 5 min). The TEC unit (TECU), which is equal to 1016 m−2 and commonly, accepted

in the art, will be used in the following.

Initial data to calculate the parameters of LS TIDs were time-series of TEC at certain sites

with corresponding time-series of the angle of elevation Θ(t) and azimuth α(t) for the satellite-

receiver line calculated by using software CONVTEC which was able to interpret GPS RINEX-

ﬁles. Continuous time-series of I(t) measurements with a duration no less than 3 hours were

chosen for determining the LS TIDs parameters.

To exclude trends caused by regular changes in ionospheric density and satellite motion, an

hour running average was subtracted from the TEC time-series. Θ(t) and α(t) were employed to

calculate coordinates of subionospheric points. To convert the variations of slant TEC to that of

vertical TEC, the a well- known technique (KLOBUCHAR, 1986)

(2)

was used, where Rz is the Earth’s radius, and hmax = 300 km is the altitude of subionospheric

points (near the F2 layer maximum).

3.1 Parameters of large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances determined from GPS data

Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the initial I(t) and detrended time-series dI(t). For the YAKZ site, only

data from the PRN30 satellite for the interval 17.00 - 20.00 UT were available for technical rea-

sons.

5

Almost all GPS records show a gradual decrease of I(t) till a certain time (tmin) corresponding

to minima (designated by diamonds in Fig. 3 and 4) in TEC variations, tmin depending on the

latitude of the GPS site. Large fast variations of TEC occur for some sites after tmin has elapsed.

Satellite PRN25 was chosen for all GPS sites analyzed (except YAKZ) because its minimum
elevation angle Θ(t) exceeded 45◦ for every station during 19.00 - 21.00 UT. Thus, the error

of converting the slanting TEC to vertical one caused by the difference between the actual and

spherically-symmetric spatial TEC distributions was minimized.

In Fig. 2, the solid lines show trajectories of motion of subionospheric points for satellite PRN25

(PRN30 for YAKZ) at the altitude of 400 km. Crosses at the trajectories indicate the positions of

subionospheric points at tmin corresponding to minimum TEC (Fig. 3, 4). Near crosses one can

ﬁnd the value of tmin expressed in terms of decimal parts of an hour. For the subionospheric point

of every GPS station, the values of tmin and amplitudes (Amin) expressed in TECU are listed in

Table 1. As is seen from Fig. 2, a minimum dI was ﬁrst recorded for the subionospheric point of
station YAKZ at 57◦ N latitude (thin line in Fig. 3c), and, after that, almost simultaneously it was
recorded near 53◦ N latitude at stations ZWEN, ARTU, KSTU (Fig. 3 a, d; b, e; c, f respectively)
which are extended along the same parallel over the longitudinal difference of 47◦. Clearly, the

ionospheric disturbance had a wave front with its length exceeding 5000 km. Forty minutes later
this disturbance was recorded at the subionospheric point for station IRKT at 51.5◦ N latitude

(Fig. 4a, d). Two hours later a similar disturbance dI(t) was recorded at a chain of stations TRAB,
SELE (Fig. 4 b, e), KITS, KUMT and URUM (Fig. 4 c, f) at 40◦ - 45◦ N latitudes.

By using Table 1 and Fig. 3 and 4, one can study the evolution of the disturbance as it travels

equatorward. The amplitude (Amin) of the disturbance dI(t) decreases from 5 TECU at the north-

ern chain of stations to 1 TECU at the southern chain. Moreover, large fast variations dI(t) typical

of the high-latitude ionosphere were recorded after passing a minimum dI(t) at the northern chain

of stations. The same result was obtained by AFRAIMOVICH ET AL. (2000). These variations

are noticeably less at the southern chain of stations.

These features of the dI(t) variations seem to be accounted for the fact that at about 19.00 UT

satellite-receiver lines for the northern chain of stations (Fig. 2) crossed the southern boundary of

the auroral zone moving southward. If the front of the disturbance has traveled with a constant

velocity, then a delay on the order of 2 hours between the times of the rise of the disturbances at

the northern and southern chains of stations corresponds to the southward velocity of about 200

m/sec. However, by using the technique of AFRAIMOVICH ET AL. (2000), one can obtain the

velocity of about 500 m/sec, and the wave vector directed southeastward. By means of a chain

6

of ionosondes, MAEDA AND HANDA (1980) and Whalen (1987) obtained similar results. The

extension of the disturbance front on the order of 5000 km obtained in this study is consistent with

results reported by WHALEN (1987), HAJKOWICZ, AND HUNSUCKER (1987).

So, in the main phase of the strong magnetic storm, a signiﬁcant descent on the order of 15-

20 TECU was observed at the northern chain of GPS sites, including ZWEN, ARTU, KSTU and

YAKZ. HUNSUCKER (1982) and BALHAZOR AND MOFFETT (1999) showed that a large area

of the polar atmosphere leaving abruptly the state of equilibrium must become the source of LS

TIDs traveling equatorward. It is necessary to point out that this period of time was characterized

by a maximum time derivative Dst (Fig. 1c) which is consistent with the conclusion of HO ET

AL. (1998).

3.2 Variations of the critical frequency and virtual altitude of the F2 layer over Almaty

Fig. 1d shows the variations of the critical frequency of the F2 layer (f0F 2) (large dots). The solid

line represents the f0F 2 current median deﬁned from three- month data (WRENN ET AL., 1987).

The day before the magnetic storm was magnetically quiet, and f0F 2(t) was close to its median

values. The main phase of the magnetic storm occurred at local night at Almaty. A decrease

of f0F 2 relative to the median, reﬂecting a depression of the electron content in the F2 layer

maximum, began soon after the beginning of the storm and a maximum difference between the

current f0F 2 and median values took place at the period of a maximum time derivative dDst/dt.

The growth of f0F 2 after the solar ionizing agent appeared is delayed with respect to the median

by two hours. Unfortunately, during 7 hours after 02.00 UT the ionosonde did not operate for

technical reasons; therefore, the time at which f0F2 approached median values was uncertain.

Variations of the virtual altitudes h′F are plotted in Fig. 1e with large dots. The solid line shows

the behavior of the h′F current median. It is seen from Fig. 1e that an abrupt increase of h′F with

respect to median values began simultaneously with the decrease of f0F 2. The approach to the

median values occurred at 01.00 UT. At that time f0F 2 was equal to 6.0 MHz, and the median

value was 11 MHz. The large decrease of f0F 2 in the course of the main phase of the magnetic

storm is consistent with the large negative disturbance of TEC recorded by GPS stations (Fig. 4).

Thus, this magnetic storm was accompanied by a very large decrease of the electron content in

the maximum of the F2 layer, and by a signiﬁcant increase of its virtual altitude.

4 OPTICAL OBSERVATIONS OF NIGHTGLOW EMISSIONS

7

4.1 Large-scale disturbances of nightglow emissions over Irkutsk

An optical facility FENIX is settled at Geophysical observatory attached to Institute of Solar-
Terrestrial physics at 100 km from Irkutsk city (51.9◦ N, 103.0◦ E ; geomagnetic latitude is 41.0◦

N, L=2). It includes a four-channel zenith photometer and a high sensitive TV-system comprising

an image ampliﬁer and a CCD (charge coupled device) array.

Following observations of nightglow emissions were made: the OI (557.7 nm) emission which

originates from a layer centered at 97 km and with boundaries at altitudes of 85 km and 115

km, the OI (630.0 nm) emission which originates from a layer centered at 250-270 km and with

boundaries at altitudes of 160-300 km, the O2 (360-410 nm) emission which originates from a

layer centered at 97 km, and the OH emission which originates from a layer centered at 85-90 km

and with boundaries at altitudes of 75-115 km.

Emission lines of 557.7 and 630 nm were recorded by using narrow band (1-2 nm halfwidth)

sweeping interference ﬁlters. Records of 360-410 nm and 720-830 emissions were obtained by

using broad band absorption ﬁlters. The angle of view of instruments was about 4-5. The instru-

ments were absolutely calibrated periodically by using the standard stars and were controlled by

using reference lamps in periods between absolute calibrations. The software provided records of

the emission rate with an exposure time of 12 sec, but when the emission rate exceeded the prede-

termined level, a shorter exposure time of 8 ms was used. In the course of the magnetic storm of

6 April 2000, the records were taken only by the four-channel zenith photometer.

Variations of the nightglow emission rate, derived from the zenith photometer observations on

6 April 2000, are plotted in Fig. 5a. The main feature of these variations is a signiﬁcant increase

of the OI (630.0 nm) emission in the second half of the night (Fig. 5a, line 1) by a factor of 20

compared with values observed near midnight and the last geomagnetic quiet night of 5 April 2000

(Fig. 5a, line 3). It can be seen that the OI (630.0 nm) emission grew after 16.00 UT till sunrise

when the observations were completed, and periodical variations were superimposed on the grad-

ual growth. The OI (557.7) emission variations (Fig. 5a, line 2) revealed a small disturbance near

17.00 UT coinciding with a similar disturbance in the OI (630.0 nm) emission, and an abrupt rise

(35%) coinciding with the ﬁrst phase of the OI (630.0 nm) emission rate maximum increase.

A gradual increase of O2 (360-410 nm) emission, not typical of the quiet geomagnetic state

(Fig. 5b, line 6 for the previous night of 5 April 2000) (Fig. 5b, line 4) was observed with superim-

posed irregular short-period variations, to begin at 17.00 UT. The 720-830 nm emission (Fig. 5b,

line 5) revealed a gradual decrease from 14.00 till 16.00 UT and ended at 16.00 UT when the

8

commencement of the geomagnetic storm occurred.

It is of interest to compare these data with variations of TEC measured at the nearest GPS station

IRKT. Records of the 630 nm and 577.7 nm emission lines (A(t)) and (B(t)) ﬁltered out from the

initial data (Fig. 5a, lines 1 and 2 respectively) as it was done with TEC I(t), are plotted in Fig. 4d.

It is seen that there is a good correlation between these variations, and the emission variations are

in an opposite phase compared with TEC variations. The possible reasons for this behavior are

discussed in part 6.

4.2 Large-scale disturbances observed by the MORTY instrument

The MORTI (Mesopause Rotational Temperature Imager) instrument is installed near Almaty in
the mountains at 2800 m above sea level (43.05◦ N, 76.97◦ E). MORTI provides information

for obtaining the rotational temperature and emission rate of the O2 atmospheric (0-1) nightglow

layer centered at 95 km (WIENS ET AL., 1991). The instrument comprises a conical mirror to

receive the light from a full circle, a narrow band (0.27 nm halfwidth) interference ﬁlter centered at

867.6 nm, an imaging lens to focus the spectrum, and a CCD camera to record the spectrum. The

emission rate and temperature observations have the precision of ±2 % and ±2 K, respectively,

when the exposure time is 5 min.

Variations of the O2 (867.6 nm) emission on 6 April 2000 are plotted by dots in Fig. 6a, and

detrended variations are shown in Fig. 6b. The quadratic trend calculated by the least square tech-

nique (Fig.6a, solid line) was subtracted from the initial record to obtain the detrended variations.

It is seen that large variations in the O2 (867.6 nm) emission were observed even before the time

of the arrival of the solitary wave caused by the magnetic storm (this time is known from the GPS

data). The period of background variations was about 2 hours, so the solitary wave excited by the

magnetic storm can be distinguished because its period was about 1 hour. In order to reduce the

effect of two-hour background variations the high pass ﬁlter realized by the hour running window

was applied to the record in Fig. 6b. Filtered variations of the O2 (867.6 nm) emission are plotted

in Fig. 4e together with variations of TEC I(t) for the GPS station SELE. It is seen from Fig. 4e

that there is a good correlation between the variations from the GPS and MORTI data. By com-

paring Fig. 4d and Fig. 4e, it becomes evident that the phase delays between the variations of the

GPS and MORTI data are different for Irkutsk and Almaty. This difference is explicable by the

different altitudes of the nightglow emissions, and the different types of optical instruments.

5 DISCUSSION

The parameters of the disturbances considered in this study are affected by various factors. These

are the localization and dynamics of the main ionospheric trough (MIT), the plasmasphere and the

plasmapause, the zone of precipitating particles (auroral oval), and magnetospheric-ionospheric

currents. During periods of great geomagnetic activity, the plasmapause boundary may approach

extreme values of L in the range of 1.7-2.5 (KHOROSHEVA, 1987), the position of MIT - about
43◦ N of invariant latitude (ANNAKULIEV ET AL., 1997), and the auroral oval boundaries -
about 48◦ N corrected geomagnetic latitudes (http://www.sec.noaa.gov/Aurora/index.html). For
Irkutsk this latitude is equal to 47◦ N. According to the data from satellite NOAA-15 (http://sec.noaa.gov/

pmap/pmapN.html) near sunrise of 7 April 2000, the auroral oval boundary (on the level of 0.1
erg/cm2s) approached 56 − 58◦ N geographical latitudes in the longitude sector under consid-

eration. Taking into consideration that the width of MIT is of several degrees, it is possible to
consider that, at least, the southern boundary of MIT approached the latitude of 52◦ N in Eastern

Siberia where optical observations were carried out. These facts suggest that in the course of the

magnetic storm considered, elements of the subauroral and even auroral ionosphere were observed

at latitudes of Irkutsk. This conclusion is supported by some features of optical observations. The

signal gain in the spectral band of 360-410 nm after 17.00 UT may be the result of a rise of the
N +

2 (ING) emission with a wavelength of 391.4 nm which is usually observed in auroras after the

ionization of N2 by precipitating electrons or precipitation of energetic atoms or ions (ISHIMOTO

et al., 1986; TINSLEY et al., 1984).

Beside the known fact of the increase of the 630.0 nm emission in midlatitudes auroras, there is

a maximum in the 630.0 nm emission at about 19.30 UT, which corresponds to a minimum TEC at

almost the same place (Fig. 4d). The same behavior of the 630.0 nm emission was observed above

Irkutsk in the course of the strong magnetic storm of 24-25 March 1991 (MIKHALEV, 1997). If a

minimum in TEC variations is related to the passage of MIT during the increase of the ring current

in the start phase of the magnetic storm, then it is possible to conclude that the maximum 630.0

nm emission develops in the region of MIT where stable auroral red (SAR) arcs occur (REES and

ROBLE, 1975).

In connection with the issue discussed, the results of LOBZIN AND PAVLOV (1998) on SAR

arcs above North America are of certain interest. In the cited paper, it was pointed out that the pale

glow in the form of SAR arcs might become the phenomenon of low-latitude aurora during strong

magnetic disturbances. During strong magnetic storms (Dst > -200 nT) the 630 nm emission

10

rate from the SAR arcs approaches 2.2 - 4.0 kR. The 630 nm emission rate recorded during the

magnetic storm considered above Irkutsk is in this emission range. Identiﬁcations of the SAR arcs

and midlatitudes lights were carried out at other papers (for example, KHOROSHEVA, 1987).

For the SAR arcs, an increase of populating 1D neutral oxygen originates from growing electron

temperature at altitudes of the F2-layer and outer ionosphere caused by an increase of the heat ﬂow

from the plasmasphere where an interchange of energy between the heat plasma and ring current

occurs. The different pattern of the change of short-period variations in the nightglow emissions

before and after the TEC minimum must be emphasized where the amplitude of these variations

after the TEC minimum is sharply increased. Besides, they correlate with short-period variations

of TEC (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 a, d). The rise of the short-period variations appears to be caused by

precipitation of energetic particles.

According to BURNS et al. (1991), TEC is directly proportional to the ratio O / (O2 + N2),

therefore when the N2 increases the local and integral electron contents decrease, and this fact is

consistent with results obtained (Fig. 4).

6 CONCLUSION

Thus, in the course of the magnetic storm of 6 April 2000, two types of disturbances were ob-

served. The ﬁrst one has features of a solitary wave with a period of about 1 hour, and was

interpreted as an LS TID originating in the polar latitudes. The second one included short-period

variations probably related to the particle precipitation. Alternatively, the wave-like disturbance

may be interpreted as a motion of structural element projections of the disturbed ionosphere (the

plasmapause and MIT) on to the region of midlatitudes during the start stage of the magnetic

storm. In this case, during a strong magnetic storm the elements of the subauroral ionosphere

were observed at the latitudes of Irkutsk.

An analysis of the data has shown that being originated the auroral disturbance induced LS soli-

tary wave with a period of about 1 hour and the front width no less 5000 km traveled equatorward

to a distance no less than 1000 km with the average velocity of about 200 m/s. The TEC distur-

bance, showing mainly a decrease of the electron content in the vicinity of the F2-layer maximum,

correlates with an increase of the emission rate in the optical band, with the temporal shift being

different for different ionospheric altitudes.

At Almaty the magnetic storm was followed by an extremely large decrease of the electron

content in the F2-layer maximum which caused a decrease of the nighttime critical frequencies by

11

4-5 MHz. The decrease of the electron content was accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase of the

F2-layer virtual height.

Fig. 1: As in Fig. 3, but for GPS stations IRK (a, d), SELE (b, e), KUMT, KIT3,

and URUM (, f ). For omparison, thin lines at the panel (d) show behavior of

the 630 nm emission rate (A(t)) and the 577.7 nm emission rate (B (t)) reorded

by the instrument FENIX and (cid:12)ltered from initial data (Fig. 5a, urves 1, 2,

respetively), as it was done for TEC data, I (t). Behavior of the 866.5 nm

emission rate (C (t)) reorded by the instrument MORTI and (cid:12)ltered from initial

data (Fig. 6b), as it was done for TEC data, I (t).

Fig. 1: Variations of the 630 nm and 577.7 nm emission rates (urve 1, 2, respe-

tively) during magneti storm of 6 April, 2000 in universal (UT)) and loal (LT)

times (a). Variations of the nightglow emissions at spetral band of 360-410 nm

(urve 4) and 720-830 nm (urve 5) (b). For omparison, variations of the 630 nm

emission rate (urve 3) and emission rate in the band of 360 - 410 nm (urve 6)

orresponded to the magnetially quiet night of 5 April, 2000 are plotted. Data

were obtained by FENIX instrument.

In this work the distribution of inter-occurrence times between earthquakes in aftershock sequences
is analyzed and a model based on a non-homogeneous Poisson (NHP) process is proposed to quantify
the observed scaling. In this model the generalized Omori’s law for the decay of aftershocks is used as
a time-dependent rate in the NHP process. The analytically derived distribution of inter-occurrence
times is applied to several major aftershock sequences in California to conﬁrm the validity of the
proposed hypothesis.

The occurrence of earthquakes is an outcome of com-
plex nonlinear threshold dynamics in the brittle part of
the Earth’s crust. This dynamics is a combined eﬀect of
diﬀerent temporal and spatial processes taking place in
a highly heterogeneous media over a wide range of tem-
poral and spatial scales [1]. Despite this complexity, one
can consider earthquakes as a point process in space and
time, by neglecting the spatial scale of earthquake rup-
ture zones and the temporal scale of the duration of each
earthquake [2, 3, 4]. Then one can study the statisti-
cal properties of this process and test models that may
explain the observed seismic activity.

In this letter, we analyze one of the important as-
pects of the seismic activity, i.e. the statistics of inter-
occurrences or waiting times of successive earthquakes
in an aftershock sequence. To summarize our results,
we have found that these statistics are consistent with a
NHP process driven by a power-law decay rate by map-
ping the occurrence of aftershocks in a multi-dimensional
space into a marked point process on the one-dimensional
time-line. The nature of this distribution is closely re-
lated to the temporal correlations between earthquakes
and can be used in hazard assessments of the occurrence
of aftershocks. We have also derived an exact formula de-
scribing the distribution of waiting times between events
in a NHP process over a ﬁnite time period T and con-
ﬁrmed it by numerical simulations.

Earthquakes form a hierarchical structure in space and
time and can also be thought of as a branching process
where each event can trigger a sequence of secondary
events and so forth. According to this structure, in some
cases it is possible to discriminate between foreshocks,
main shocks, and aftershocks, although, this classiﬁca-
tion is not well deﬁned and can be ambiguous. However,
it is observed that moderate and strong earthquakes ini-
tiate sequences of secondary events which decay in time.
These sequences are called aftershocks and their spatial
and temporal distributions provide valuable information
about the earthquake generating process [5].

Earthquakes follow several empirical scaling laws.
Most prominent of them is Gutenberg-Richter relation
[6] which states that the cumulative number of events

greater than magnitude m, N (≥ m), follows an expo-
nential distribution N (≥ m) ∝ 10−b m, where b is a uni-
versal exponent near unity. This distribution becomes a
power-law when the magnitude is replaced with the seis-
mic moment, as the magnitude scales as a logarithm of
the seismic moment. Another empirical power-law scal-
ing relation describes the temporal decay of aftershock se-
quences in terms of the frequency of occurrence of events
per unit time, this is called the modiﬁed Omori’s law
[7]. The spatial distribution of faults on which earth-
quakes occur also satisfy (multi-)fractal statistics [8, 9].
These laws are manifestations of the self-similar nature
of earthquake processes.

Based on studies of properties of California seismic-
ity, an attempt to introduce a uniﬁed scaling law for the
temporal distribution of earthquakes was proposed [10].
The distribution of inter-occurrence times between suc-
cessive earthquakes was obtained by using as scaling pa-
rameter both a grid size over which the region was subdi-
vided, and a lower magnitude cutoﬀ. Two distinct scaling
regimes were found. For short times, aftershocks domi-
nate the scaling properties of the distribution, decaying
according to the modiﬁed Omori’s law. For long times,
an exponential scaling regime was found that can be as-
sociated with the occurrence of main shocks. To take
into account the spatial heterogeneity of seismic activity,
it has been argued that the second regime is not an ex-
ponential but another power-law [11]. An analysis of the
change in behavior between these two regimes based on a
nonstationary Poisson sequence of events was carried out
in [12]. The further analysis of aftershock sequences in
California and Iceland revealed the existence of another
scaling regime for small values of inter-occurrence times
[9].

An alternative approach to describe a uniﬁed scaling of
earthquake recurrence times was suggested in [13, 14, 15],
where the distributions computed for diﬀerent spatial ar-
eas and magnitude ranges were rescaled with the rate
of seismic activity for each area considered. It was ar-
gued that the seismic rate fully controls the observed
scaling, and that the shape of the distribution can be ap-
proximated by the generalized gamma function, indicat-

ing the existence of correlations in the recurrence times
beyond the duration of aftershock sequences. This ap-
proach agrees with observations that main shocks show
a nonrandom behavior with some eﬀects of long-range
memory [16].

Before we carry out an analysis of seismic data, we will
outline a derivation of a distribution function for waiting
times between events in a point process characterized by
a rate r(t) and distributed according to NHP statistics
over a ﬁnite time interval T . The full analysis is going
to be reported elsewhere [17]. The instantaneous proba-
bility distribution function of waiting times Y at time t,
until the next event in accordance with the NHP process
hypothesis has the following form [4]

In order to check the correctness of the derivation of
Eq. (2) we have performed numerical simulations of the
NHP process with a decaying time dependent rate r(t).
Speciﬁcally, we have used a power-law rate deﬁned as

(cid:1)

r(t) =

τ (1 + t/c)p ,

(3)

where τ is a characteristic time that deﬁnes the rate at
time t = 0, c is a second characteristic time that elim-
inates the singularity at t = 0, and p is a power-law
exponent. This rate is commonly used to describe the
relaxation of aftershock sequences after a main shock and
is called the modiﬁed Omori’s law [7].

In Fig. 1a we show plots of numerical simulations of
the NHP process with varying scaling parameters τ , c,
and T with ﬁxed p = 1.2. These are indicated as solid
symbols. We also plot the corresponding numerical in-
tegrations of Eq. (2) for the same values of τ , c, and T .
The comparison shows that Eq. (2) correctly describes
the inter-occurrence time distributions between events.

We have also performed a scaling analysis of our sim-
ulated distributions for the values ∆t ≥ 150 s. This is
shown in Fig. 1b. The distributions collapse onto each

where α = 1.212 and β = 1.194. The scaling function
f (x) can be approximated by the generalized gamma
function f (x) = A xγ exp(−x/B) with γ = 0.056, A =
0.329, and B = 1.122. The distribution functions have
two characteristic time-scales, i.e. τ and τ (T /c)β, which
deﬁne two roll overs for small and large ∆t’s.

To ﬁnd scaling relations between the above exponents,
one has to perform an asymptotic analysis of the integral
(2) for large ∆t ≫ 1 and T ≫ 1. This analysis can be
done by using Laplace’s method [18] and gives P (∆t) ∼
∆t−(2−1/p) for T → ∞ and P (∆t) ∼ exp[−∆t/τ (1 +
T /c)p] for ﬁnite T , from which we conclude that α − γ =
2−1/p and β = p. The exponent 2−1/p was also reported
in [7].

To check the proposed hypothesis that aftershocks can
be modeled as a NHP process, the derived distribution
(2) has been compared to several aftershock sequences in

California. We have used the seismic catalog provided
by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCSN
catalog, http://www.data.scec.org). The identiﬁcation
of aftershock sequences is usually an ambiguous problem
which requires assumptions on the spatial and tempo-
ral clustering of aftershocks [5]. In this work we assume
that all events that have occurred after a main shock
within a given time interval T and a square area L × L
are aftershocks of a particular main shock. By neglecting
the magnitude, spatial size and duration of each individ-
ual event and considering all aftershocks above a certain
threshold mc, we map a multi-dimensional process into
a process on the one-dimensional time-line. This marked
process is characterized by the times of occurrence of in-
dividual events ti and their magnitudes mi. We deﬁne
inter-occurrence or waiting times between successive af-
tershocks as ∆ti = ti − ti−1, i = 1, 2, . . . and study their
statistical distribution over a ﬁnite time interval T .

In this work, we use the decay rate of aftershocks,
introduced in [19, 20], which is a generalization of the
modiﬁed Omori’s law (3), where the characteristic time
−m) is a function of the lower

cutoﬀ magnitude of an aftershock sequence m, m⋆ is the
maximum value of an aftershock in a sequence with ﬁnite
number of events, and p > 1. We also assume that af-
tershock sequences satisfy the Gutenberg-Richter cumu-
⋆−m). This deﬁnes
lative distribution N (≥ m) = 10b (m
a truncated distribution where the expected number of
events with magnitudes greater than m⋆ is equal to one
and the exponent b is generally near unity [21].

In Fig. 2 we have computed the distribution functions
of inter-occurrence times between successive aftershocks
from the observed data of three California aftershock se-
quences. These are indicated as solid symbols in Fig. 2.
For each of these sequences we have used square boxes
of size L × L = 1.25◦ × 1.25◦ for the Landers earth-
quake (mms = 7.3; Jun 28, 1992) and 1.0◦ × 1.0◦ for
the Northridge (mms = 6.7; Jan 17, 1994) and Hector
Mine (mms = 7.1; Oct 16, 1999) earthquakes centered
on the epicenter of the main shocks and a time interval
of T = 1 year. All the earthquakes that occurred in the
spatio-temporal boxes were treated as aftershocks. The
analysis of the data shows that the distributions are not
too sensitive to changes in the linear size L of the box,
the results are almost the same for L ranging from 0.25◦
to 1.75◦ within statistical errors. This means that the
distributions are dominated by the activity of the events
generated by the main shocks and the background seis-
micity doesn’t contribute signiﬁcantly to the scaling.

In this analysis of an aftershock sequence as a point
process we treat all earthquakes as having the same mag-
nitude and as a result we lose a signiﬁcant fraction of
information related to the physics of the process. To re-
cover some information from the magnitude domain of
each sequence we have used a lower magnitude cutoﬀ mc
as a scaling parameter and study sequences with diﬀer-

and Hector Mine (p = 1.22, τ = 83.71 s) sequences. In each

time intervals between events. Another scaling parame-
ter which aﬀects the roll over is the time interval T . An
increase in T leads to the occurrence of longer intervals
∆t between events.

To compare the observed scaling with the simulations
of a NHP process we also plot in Fig. 2, as solid curves,
the distributions computed assuming that aftershock se-
quences follow NHP statistics with the rate given by
Eq. (3) and the parameters τ , c, and p estimated from the
observed three California aftershock sequences [19]. The
plots show that the modeled distributions are in excellent
agreement with the observations.

We have also performed a scaling analysis of the
inter-occurrence time distributions of these aftershock se-
quences. This is shown in Fig 3. The characteristic time
c and the time interval T have been chosen as scaling pa-
rameters. These sequences are characterized by slightly
diﬀerent initial rates τ and exponents p. The results show
a reasonably good scaling with respect to c and T which
supports our hypothesis that aftershock sequences can be
described as a NHP process.

In summary, the studies of inter-occurrence of after-
shocks presented in this work suggest that aftershock
sequences can be modeled to a good approximation as
a point process governed by NHP statistics, where the
rate of activity decays as a power-law (Eq. 3). This de-
caying rate introduces a self-similar regime into the ob-
served scaling followed by an exponential roll over. An

and deviation from NHP behavior. The knowledge of the

type of distribution that governs the occurrence of after-
shocks is important in any hazard assessment programs.
The derived distribution (Eq. 2) has much broader ap-
plicability and can be used for studies of many time de-
pendent processes which follow NHP statistics.

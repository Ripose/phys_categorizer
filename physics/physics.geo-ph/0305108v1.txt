Neutron spin can be coupled to the Earth’s rotating fre-
quency. Once if the Earth’s rotating frequency is time-
dependent, then the neutron will acquire a Berry’s topolog-
ical phase (cyclic adiabatic geometric phase). So, a potential
method to investigate the Earth’s time-varying rotating fre-
quency by measuring the phase diﬀerence between geometric
phases of neutron spin polarized vertically down and up is
proposed.

In gravity theory, the intrinsic spin of a particle can
be regarded as a gravitomagnetic dipole moment [1–3].
For this reason, it can be coupled to the gravitomag-
netic ﬁelds. According to the principle of equivalence,
the rotating frequency of a non-inertial system can be
considered a gravitomagnetic ﬁeld, and in consequence
the Coriolis force acting upon a moving particle can be
regarded as a Lorentz (gravitomagnetic) force. Thus, a
spinning particle in a rotating frame of reference will be
coupled to the rotating frequency, which is termed the
spin-rotation coupling. The Hamiltonian describing this
interaction of particle spin S with the rotating frequency
~ω of a non-inertial frame is written as H = ~ω · S [1–3].
The spin-rotation coupling leads to the inertial eﬀects
of the intrinsic spin of a particle, for instance, although
the equivalence principle still holds, the universality of
Galileo’s law of freely falling particles is violated, pro-
vided that the spin of falling particle is polarized verti-
cally up or down in the non-inertial frame [1].

If the Hamiltonian H of a quantum system is time-
dependent, then it will give rise to a geometric phase
(Berry’s phase) [4]. Diﬀering from dynamical phase that
depends on dynamical quantities of systems such as en-
ergy, frequency, velocity as well as coupling coeﬃcients,
geometric phase is independent of these dynamical quan-
Instead, it is only related to the geometric na-
tities.
ture of the pathway along which quantum systems evolve.
This, therefore, implies that geometric phase presents the
topological and global properties of quantum systems in
time-evolution process, and that it possesses the physical
signiﬁcance and can thus be applied to various ﬁelds of
physics.

If the Earth’s rotating frequency is time-dependent,
i.e., ~ω(t) whose precession frequency and precessional
cone angle are respectively Ω and θ, then the inter-
acting Hamiltonian of neutron spin-rotation coupling is
H(t) = ~ω(t) · S. The time-dependent quantum system

is governed by the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation.
By using Berry’s phase formula or Lewis-Riesenfeld in-
variant theory [3,5], one can arrive at the expression for
Berry’s phase, φ(Berry)

cessional cycle (T = 2π
Ω ), acquired by the neutrons, where
the sign ± corresponds to the cases of neutron polarized
vertically up and down, respectively.

The variation of the Earth’s rotating frequency may be
caused by the motion of interior matter, tidal force and
the motion of atmosphere as well. Once we have infor-
mation on the Earth’s rotating frequency, it is possible
to investigate the motion of matter on the Earth. Here
we suggest a potential approach to detecting the ﬂuctua-
tions of the Earth’s time-dependent rotation: speciﬁcally,
measuring the geometric phase arising from the interac-
tion between neutron spin and the Earth’s rotation by
using neutron interferometry experiment [6,7], which has
been successful in investigating the Aharonov-Carmi ef-
fect, the gravitational analogue to the Aharonov-Bohm
eﬀect in electrodynamics.

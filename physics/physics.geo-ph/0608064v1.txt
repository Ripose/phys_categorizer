Abstract. Earthquakes and aftershock sequences follow several empirical
scaling laws: One of these laws is B˚ath’s law for the magnitude of the largest
aftershock.
In this work, Modiﬁed Form of B˚ath’s Law and its application
to KOERI data have been studied. B˚ath’s law states that the diﬀerences
in magnitudes between mainshocks and their largest detected aftershocks are
approximately constant,
independent of the magnitudes of mainshocks and it
is about 1.2. In the modiﬁed form of B˚ath’s law for a given mainshock we get
the inferred largest aftershock of this mainshock by using an extrapolation of the
Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude statistics of the aftershock sequence. To
test the applicability of this modiﬁed law, 6 large earthquakes that occurred in
Turkey between 1950 and 2004 with magnitudes equal to or greater than 6.9 have
been considered. These earthquakes take place on the North Anatolian Fault
Zone. Additionally, in this study the partitioning of energy during a mainshock-
aftershock sequence was also calculated in two diﬀerent ways. It is shown that
most of the energy is released in the mainshock. The constancy of the diﬀerences
in magnitudes between mainshocks and their largest aftershocks is an indication
of scale-invariant behavior of aftershock sequences.

1. INTRODUCTION

An earthquake is a sudden and sometimes catastrophic movement of a part of the
Earth’s surface [1]. It is caused by the release of stress accumulated along geologic
faults or by volcanic activity, hence the earthquakes are the Earth’s natural means of
releasing stress. When the Earth’s plates move against each other, stress is put on the
lithosphere. When this stress is strong enough, the lithosphere breaks or shifts. As
the plates move they put forces on themselves and each other. When the force is large
enough, the crust is forced to break. When the break occurs, the stress is released as
energy which moves through the Earth in the form of waves, which we feel and call
an earthquake.

Aftershocks are earthquakes in the same region of the mainshock[1]. Smaller
earthquakes often occur in the immediate area of the main earthquake until the
entire surface has reached equilibrium of stress. There are several scaling laws that
describe the statistical properties of aftershock sequences [2, 3, 4]. Gutenberg-Richter
frequency-magnitude scaling law is widely known by seismologists and scientists. On
the Richter scale, the magnitude (M) of an earthquake is proportional to the log of
the maximum amplitude of the earth’s motion. What this means is that if the Earth

The application of the modiﬁed form of B˚ath’s law to the North Anatolian Fault Zone2

moves one millimeter in a magnitude 2.0 earthquake, it will move ten millimeters in
a magnitude 3.0 earthquake, 100 millimeters in a magnitude 4.0 earthquake and ten
meters in a magnitude 6.0 earthquake. So, the amplitude of the waves increases by
powers of ten in relation to the Richter magnitude numbers. Therefore, if we hear
about a magnitude 8.0 earthquake and a magnitude 4 earthquake, we know that the
ground is moving 10, 000 times more in the magnitude 8.0 earthquake than in the
magnitude 4.0 earthquake. Numbers for the Richter scale range from 0 to 9.0, though
no real upper limit exists. The diﬀerence in energies is even greater. For each factor
of ten in amplitude, the energy grows by a factor of 32. When seismologists started
measuring the magnitudes of earthquakes, they found that there were a lot more small
earthquakes than large ones. Seismologists have found that the number of earthquakes
is proportional to 10−bM . They call this law “The Gutenberg-Richter Law” [3, 4, 5].
In seismological studies, the Omori law, proposed by Omori in 1894, is one of the
few basic empirical laws [6]. This law describes the decay of aftershock activity with
time. Omori Law and its modiﬁed forms have been used widely as a fundamental
tool for studying aftershocks [7]. Omori published his work on the aftershocks of
earthquakes, in which he stated that aftershock frequency decreases by roughly the
reciprocal of time after the main shock. An extension of the modiﬁed Omori’s law is
the epidemic type of aftershock sequences (ETAS) model [7]. It is a stochastic version
of the modiﬁed Omori law. In the ETAS model, the rate of aftershock occurrence is
an eﬀect of combined rates of all secondary aftershock subsequences produced by each
aftershock [8, 9].

The third scaling law relating the aftershocks is B˚ath’s law. The empirical B˚ath’s
law states that the diﬀerence in magnitude between a mainshock and its largest
aftershock is constant, regardless of the mainshock magnitude and it is about 1.2
[3, 4, 7, 10]. That is

∆m = mms − mmax
with mms the magnitude of the mainshock, mmax
detected aftershock, and ∆m approximately a constant.

In this article we study the modiﬁed form of B˚ath’s law [3, 4]. To study
the aftershock sequence in the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) we get the
largest aftershock from an extrapolation of the G-R frequency-magnitude scaling
of all measured aftershocks. We test the applicability of B˚ath’s law for 6 large
earthquakes on the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ). The emprical form of
B˚ath’s law states that the diﬀerence magnitude between a mainshock and its largest
aftershock is constant, independent of the magnitudes of mainshocks. We also analyze
the partitioning of energy during a mainshock-aftershock sequence and its relation to
the modiﬁed B˚ath’s law.

The application of the modiﬁed form of B˚ath’s law to the North Anatolian Fault Zone3

and Richter, introduced the common description of the frequency of earthquakes: [5]

log10N (≥ m) = a − bm

(2)
where N (≥ m) is the cumulative number of earthquakes with magnitudes greater
than m occurring in a speciﬁed area and time window. On this equation a and b are
constants. This relation is valid for earthquakes with magnitudes above some lower
cutoﬀ mc. Earlier studies [3, 4, 11] gave an estimate for this “b” value between 0.8 and
1.2. The constant “a” shows the regional level of seismicity and gives the logarithm of
the number of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than zero [3, 4]. In our analysis
a-value is in the range 3.8 < a < 6.5. Aftershocks related with a mainshock also

cumulative number of aftershocks of a given mainshock with magnitudes greater than
m. We oﬀer to extrapolate G-R scaling (2) for aftershocks. Our aim is to obtain an
upper cutoﬀ magnitude in a given aftershock sequence. We ﬁnd the magnitude of
this inferred “largest” aftershock m∗ by formally taking N (≥ m∗) = 1 for a given
aftershock sequence.

a = bm∗

(3)
This extrapolated m∗ value will have a mean value and a standard deviation from the
mean value. We apply the B˚ath’s law to the inferred values of m∗ and then, we can
write

∆m∗

= mms − m∗

(4)
where mms is the magnitude of the mainshock and ∆m∗ is approximately a constant.
Substitution of equations (3) and (4) into equation (2) gives

log10[N (≥ m)] = b(mms − ∆m∗ − m)

(5)
with b, mms, and ∆m∗ speciﬁed, the frequency-magnitude distribution of aftershocks
can be determined using equation (5). In extrapolating the G-R scaling (2) the slope
of this scaling or b-value plays an important role in estimating the largest inferred
magnitude m∗.

3. APPLICATION OF THE MODIFIED FORM OF B˚ATH’S LAW TO
THE NORTH ANATOLIAN FAULT ZONE (NAFZ)

We applied modiﬁed form of B˚ath’s law by considering 6 large earthquakes on the
NAFZ. These earthquakes occurred between 1950 and 2004. The data were provided
by Bogazici University Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute
(KOERI)[12]. The 6 earthquakes considered had magnitudes mms ≥ 6.9. The
important point is that they were suﬃciently separated in space and time so that
no aftershock sequences overlapped with other mainshocks. Earthquakes form a
hierarchical structure in space and time. Therefore, in some cases it is possible to
discriminate foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks. But, generally this classiﬁcation
is not well deﬁned and can be ambiguous. One of our main problems in the study
of aftershocks is to identify what is and what is not an aftershock [13]. To specify
aftershocks we deﬁned space and time windows for each sequence. In each case we
consider a square area centered on the mainshock epicenter. The linear size of the box
is taken to be of the order of the linear extent of the aftershock zone L, which scales
with the magnitude of the mainshock as
L = 0.02 × 100.5mmskm

Figure 1. Frequency-magnitude distribution of Kocaeli-G¨olc¨uk earthquake

This equation was given by Yan Y. Kagan [14]. Previously, Shcherbakov and Turcotte
used the same scaling arguments for 10 earthquakes in California [3, 4]. Time intervals
of 92, 183, 365, 730, and 1095 days are taken except C¸ anakkale-Yenice, Mu¸s-Varto, and
Adapazarı-Mudurnu earthquakes. It should also be noted that for all 6 earthquakes
we took mL, Richter magnitudes.

For Kocaeli-G¨olc¨uk earthquake the mainshock is mms = 7.4 and the largest
detected aftershock had a magnitude mmax
as = 5.8. From equation (1) the diﬀerence
in magnitude between the mainshock and largest aftershock is ∆m = 1.6. We have
correlated the aftershock frequency magnitude data given in Figure 1 with G-R scaling
(2) and ﬁnd b = 0.91 ± 0.05 and a = 4.97 ± 0.20. From equation (3) the inferred
magnitude of the largest aftershock is m∗ = 5.46 ± 0.37. From equation (4) the
diﬀerence in magnitude between the mainshock and the inferred largest aftershock is
∆m∗ = 1.94±0.37. We applied the same procedure to the all 6 earthquakes and found
a, b, m∗, and ∆m∗ parameters.

For these 6 earthquakes, the a, b, mms, mmax

as

, ∆m, m∗, and ∆m∗ values are

given in Table 1.

According to our results, the mean of the diﬀerences between mainshock and
largest detected aftershock magnitudes is ∆m = 1.63 ± 0.23. The mean of the inferred
values of ∆m∗ obtained from the best ﬁt of equation (5) is ∆m∗ = 1.42 ± 0.18. In
addition for these earthquakes the mean of b values is b = 0.81 ± 0.02.

4. Radiated Energy During an Earthquake

Seismologists have more recently developed a standard magnitude scale that is called
the moment magnitude, and it comes from the seismic moment. To understand the
seismic moment, we need to go back to the deﬁnition of torque. A torque is an agent
that changes the angular momentum of a system. It is deﬁned as the force times the
distance from the center of rotation. Earthquakes are caused by internal torques, from
the interactions of diﬀerent blocks of the earth on opposite sides of faults. It can be
shown that the moment of an earthquake is simply expressed by

M0 = µAd

(7)

where M0=Moment, µ=Rock Rigidity, A=Fault Area, and d=Slip Distance. Both the
magnitude and the seismic moment are related to the amount of energy that is radiated
by an earthquake. Radiated energy is a particularly important aspect of earthquake
behavior, because it causes all the damage and loss of life, and additionally, it is the
greatest source of observational data. So, the seismic radiated energy is an important
physical parameter to study on earthquakes. The relationships between the radiated
energy, stress drop, and earthquake size provides information about the physics of the
rupture process. Richter and Gutenberg, developed a relationship between magnitude
and energy. Their relationship is:
3
2

log10[E(m)] =

m + 11.8

(8)

It should be noted that in this relation E(m) is not the total “intrinsic” energy of the
earthquake. It is only the radiated energy from the earthquake and a small fraction of

The application of the modiﬁed form of B˚ath’s law to the North Anatolian Fault Zone7

the total energy transferred during the earthquake process. We can write this equation
in this form [3, 15].

log10[E(m)] =

m + log10E0

3
2

with E0 = 6.3 × 104J. Our aim is to determine the ratio of the total seismic energy
radiated in the aftershock sequence to the seismic energy radiated in the mainshock.
This relation can be used directly to relate the radiated energy from the mainshock
Ems to the moment magnitude of the mainshock mms
Ems = E010(3/2)mms

(10)

4.1. The First Calculation Method To Find The Energy Ratio Between Mainshock

mainshock and about 0.8 per cent of energy is released during the aftershocks.

If we further assume that all earthquakes have the same seismic eﬃciency (ratio of

ratio of the drop in stored elastic energy due to the aftershocks to the drop in stored

According to our results, we ﬁnd the mean energy

Ems+Eas = 0.015 with a
standard deviation σE = 0.012. Consequently, we ﬁnd that the ratio of radiated
energy in aftershocks to the radiated energy in the mainshock is constant. This is
consistent with the generally accepted condition of self-similarity for earthquakes. For
these earthquakes on average about 98.5 per cent of the available elastic energy goes
into the mainshock and about 1.5 per cent into the aftershocks.

5. Discussion

Earthquakes occur in clusters. After one earthquake happens, we usually see others
at nearby or identical location. Clustering of earthquakes usually occurs near the
location of the mainshock. The stress on the mainshock’s fault changes drastically
during the mainshock and that fault produces most of the aftershocks. This causes a
change in the regional stress, the size of which decreases rapidly with distance from
the mainshock. Sometimes the change in stress caused by the mainshock is great
enough to trigger aftershocks on other, nearby faults. It is accepted that aftershocks
are caused by stress transfer during an earthquake. When an earthquake occurs there
are adjacent regions where the stress is increased. The relaxation of these stresses
causes aftershocks [3, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

Several scaling laws are also found to be universally valid for aftershocks [2, 3, 4].

These are:

(i) Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude scaling

(ii) The modiﬁed Omori’s law for the temporal decay of aftershocks
(iii) B˚ath’s law for the magnitude of the largest aftershock

In this work we used both B˚ath’s law and G-R scaling. Our aim is to ﬁnd an upper
cutoﬀ magnitude m∗ for a given aftershock sequence. Using relation (3), we get related
a and b values in the G-R scaling. B˚ath’s law states that, to a good approximation,
the diﬀerence in magnitude between mainshock and its largest aftershock is a constant
independent of the mainshock magnitude. A modiﬁed form of B˚ath’s law was proposed
by Shcherbakov and Turcotte in 2004 [3, 4]. They considered 10 large earthquakes
that occurred in California between 1987 and 2003 with magnitudes equal to or
greater than mms ≥ 5.5. According to their theory the mean diﬀerence in magnitudes
between these mainshocks and their largest detected aftershocks is 1.16 ± 0.46. This
result is consistent with B˚ath’s Law. They found the mean diﬀerence in magnitudes
between the mainshocks and their largest inferred aftershocks is 1.11 ± 0.29. They
also calculated the partitioning of energy during a mainshock-aftershock sequence and
found that about 96 per cent of the energy dissipated in a sequence is associated with
the mainshock and the rest (4 per cent) is due to aftershocks. Their results are given
in Table 5. We applied the Modiﬁed Form of B˚ath’s Law to our 6 large earthquakes
that occurred on the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) in Turkey. We followed the
same calculation process.

According to Table 5, for the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), a large fraction
of the accumulated energy is released in the mainshock and only a relatively small
fraction of the accumulated energy is released in the aftershock sequence. The results
of Turcotte and Shcherbakov are for the ten earthquakes in California on the San
Andreas Fault Zone. Although SAFZ (in California) and NAFZ (in Turkey) have the
same seismic properties, the released energy during the mainshocks in the NAFZ is
much greater than the released energy during the mainshocks in the SAFZ.

Figure 7 shows the dispersion of the magnitude diﬀerences ∆m and ∆m∗ on the
mainshock magnitude mms. In this ﬁgure, white symbols correspond to ∆m values
and black symbols correspond to ∆m∗ values. Square, circle and triangle were used
to prevent the coincides of the data on the ﬁgure; because for six earthquakes, three
of them have the same mainshock magnitude mms = 7.2.

Additionally, Figure 8 gives us the relation between ∆m and ∆m∗. In this ﬁgure,
line 1 shows the harmony of our data with the B˚ath’s Law. According to Figure 8,
our data do not show harmony with the B˚ath’s Law. B˚ath’s Law states that the
diﬀerence in magnitude between a mainshock and its largest detected aftershock is

constant, regardless of the mainshock magnitude and it is about 1.2 [3, 4, 7, 10].
But in Figure 8, only one earthquake has ∆m values equal to 1.2. The other ﬁve
earthquakes have ∆m values greater than 1.2. Consequently, only 17 per cent of our
data show harmony with the B˚ath’s Law. The rest part ( 83 per cent) of our data do
not show harmony with the B˚ath’s Law.

The constancy of the diﬀerences in magnitudes between mainshocks and their
largest aftershocks is an indication of scale-invariant behavior of aftershock sequences.
In Figure 8, line 2 shows the harmony of our data with the Modiﬁed Form of
B˚ath’s Law. This line corresponds to y = x line. If the Modiﬁed Form of B˚ath’s Law
gave us perfect results, ∆m and ∆m∗ values would be close to each other along this
line. Hence, they would be the near of line 2. But in Figure 8, only one earthquake
takes place on the upper side of this line. The remaining ﬁve earthquakes take place
on the lower side of this line. Consequently, our data do not show harmony with the
Modiﬁed Form of B˚ath’s Law.

The other important conclusion is that we know most of the energy is released
during the mainshock. Therefore, after the mainshock the community and government
may begin their work to rescue people from the debris without wasting any time.

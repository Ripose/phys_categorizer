Application of numerical methods to modeling
the stellar wind and interstellar medium interaction

Interaction between the stellar wind, including
Abstract.
the solar wind, and the interstellar medium has long been
the subject of investigation by both astrophysicists and ﬂuid
dynamicists. This is, ﬁrst, due to the possibility of comparison
of physical models for such interaction with the measurements
performed by Voyager, Pioneer, and Ulysses spacecrafts. On
the other hand, a complicated structure of the ﬂow containing
several discontinuities makes it a challenging problem for the
application of modern numerical methods both in gasdynamic
and magnetogasdynamic (MHD) cases.

In the solar wind case, the problem becomes even more
complicated, since the charge-exchange processes between
ions and neutral particles must be taken into account. The con-
tinuum equations are not applicable to the description of the
neutral particle motion, for their mean free path is much larger
than the characteristic length scale of the problem. In this case,
either approximate coupling models or direct Monte-Carlo
simulation are required. The spatial nonuniformity of the so-
lar wind and its perturbations and periodicity make the prob-
lem three-dimensional and nonstationary. From a mechanical
viewpoint the problem represents the interaction of the uni-
form interstellar medium and the spherically-symmetric (or
asymmetric) solar wind ﬂow. We consider various approaches
used by different authors to solve this problem numerically.

The presence of the contact surface dividing the two ﬂows
rises the question of its stability. We discuss the reasons of
such instabilities and parameters which inﬂuence it.

The presence of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld necessitates
solution of the MHD equations for proper analysis of the
obtained data. Although the system of governing equations
remains hyperbolic in this case, the multivariance of the exact
solution to the MHD Riemann problem makes inefﬁcient its
application for regular calculations. On the other hand, the
solution to the linearized Riemann problem is nonunique. We
discuss the possible ways of applying the Roe-type methods
and some simpliﬁed approaches for numerical solution of the
ideal MHD equations. One of the difﬁculties in the solution

of the MHD system is the satisfaction of the magnetic ﬁeld
divergence-free condition. Different ways to solve this task
are discussed. If the magnetic ﬁeld vector in the uniform in-
terstellar medium ﬂow is not parallel to the velocity vector, the
problem becomes three-dimensional. Both approximate and
exact numerical solutions are considered which were applied
in this case.

Far-ﬁeld numerical boundary conditions play an essen-
tial role in astrophysical applications owing to very large
length scales usual for these problems. We discuss several
approaches that may be useful to solve problems similar to
the stellar wind and interstellar medium interaction.

INTRODUCTION

≪

The problem of the stellar wind, with the emphasis on the so-
lar wind, interaction with the interstellar medium has long
been the topic of interest for astrophysicists and special-
ists in the ﬁeld of the solar–terrestrial physics [2], [3], [21],
[28], and [69]. In [6], the application of the continuum equa-
tions for this problem is systematically discussed. The ﬁrst
qualitative model for the interaction of the solar wind (SW)
and the local interstellar medium (LISM) was proposed by
E.N. Parker [69]. He assumed the interstellar medium to be a
1 (see Fig. 1).
subsonic stream with the Mach number M∞
Here HP is a heliopause dividing the SW and the LISM
ﬂow. Generally speaking the above assumption is not correct,
20
since the velocity of the interstellar medium is V∞
km/s and the scattering experiments for the solar radiation
show that the temperature T∞ of charged particles consti-
tuting the LISM is about 104K. Taking into account that the
number density of charged particles is usually considered to
0.1 cm−3, the LISM ﬂow can most likely be sup-
be n∞
posed supersonic than subsonic. The supersonic model of the
interaction was ﬁrst proposed in [5]. The important feature
of this approach lies in the application of the continuum (Eu-
ler gasdynamic) equations only to the charged particles of
both counteracting winds. Although the presence of turbulent
pulsations of plasma is supposed to be insigniﬁcant for the
mean ﬂow structure, their inﬂuence is realized by a remark-
able change of transport coefﬁcients due to the possibility
of scattering of charged particles on electromagnetic plasma
ﬂuctuations. This results in the substantial decrease of their

mean free path compared with that calculated on the basis
of the Coulomb collisions. The solar wind consists mainly of
10 cm−3
electrons and protons with the number density ne
and velocity Ve
400–500 km/s and is also considered su-
personic. The index “e” corresponds to values measured at
1011 km, that is, at the Earth distance from the
1AU = 1.5
Sun. Thus, we can consider this problem, from a gasdynamic
viewpoint, as a an interaction of the supersonic spherically-
symmetric (or asymmetric) source ﬂow of SW with the uni-
form supersonic LISM ﬂow. This assumption gave rise to a
so-called two-shock model. Generally speaking, this model
can be easily obtained numerically if one choses as initial
data for this interaction the arbitrary jump between the SW
and the LISM parameters.

The source ﬂow is essentially a combination of supersonic
jet and blunt-body ﬂows which are perfectly well studied
and described in classical gas dynamics. The extension to the
solar wind and space situation [31], [95] has been validated by
numerous spacecraft observations of the plasma environment
of several planets. Different ﬂow regimes and shock-wave
ﬂow structure for the SW–LISM interaction was discussed
in [106].

In [7] and [113] the axisymmetric problem of the interac-
tion was considered on the basis of the shock-ﬁtting approach,
but due to the limitations of the applied numerical method the
authors calculated only the upwind part of the ﬂow. In [55] and
[92] the problem of the stellar wind interaction with the inter-
stellar medium was analyzed in the closed region surrounding
the star. These numerical results conﬁrmed the scheme [106],
but the bullet shape of the internal shock was obtained for a
broader range of parameters. The general schematic picture
is shown in Fig. 2.

Here TS is the inner shock terminating the solar wind within
the heliopause (HP), BS is the bow shock, or the outer shock.
TS at a certain point may turn to form the Mach disk (MD).
At this triple point the reﬂected shock (RS) and the slip line
(SL) originate.

This picture is similar to that suggested for the SW–comet
interaction in [106]. The termination shock conﬁguration is
caused by its Mach-type reﬂection from the symmetry axis.

In [3], [18], [29], [32], [40], [104], and [105] the opinion
was stated that the resonance recharge processes between the
neutral and the charged particles should strongly inﬂuence
the ﬂow picture. The description of the neutral particle mo-
tion cannot be made on the basis of the continuum approach.
For this reason in [8] an approximate method of taking into
account this inﬂuence was suggested and, later, in [11] a self-
consistent model was developed that takes into account the
recharge processes. The Monte-Carlo method was used to
calculate the trajectories of neutral particles. As was admitted
in [104] and conﬁrmed by [8] and [11], the charge-exchange
effect effectively diminishes the Mach number of the LISM
ﬂow. This justiﬁes development of alternative subsonic mod-
els of the interaction [48].

Of great importance are also nonstationary problems asso-
ciated with the variable solar activity. In [15], [75], and [97]
the problem was investigated of the time-dependent SW per-
turbation inﬂuence on the whole ﬂow structure. The nonsta-
tionary picture of the ﬂow and the termination shock response
to the 11-year variation of the solar wind were studied in [17],
[47], and [76].

T. Matsuda et al. [55] discussed the instabilities of the con-
tact discontinuity dividing the SW and the LISM ﬂow. These
instabilities originated in its lateral region and near the stag-
nation point of the ﬂow. Unstable solutions were obtained in
the parameter range which was not exactly suitable for the
solar wind and the local interstellar medium ﬂow and, there-
fore, were disputed in [96]. Recently in [52] a hydrodynamic
instability of the heliopause driven by plasma–neutral charge-
exchange processes was discussed.

According to the solar minimum observations by the Uly-
sses spacecraft, the solar wind properties depend on helioalti-
tude. The solar wind in this case is no longer spherically-
symmetric (see also [99]). In [71] a 3D problem of the in-
teraction was used and obtained results were compared with
those for the isotropic solar wind.

The inﬂuence of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld can be im-
portant in the regions, for which the magnetic pressure is
comparable by its value with the dynamic pressure of the ﬂow.
Magnetic ﬁeld causes an increase of the maximum speed of

×

×

small perturbations in the LISM ﬂow, thus leading to the de-
crease of its effective Mach number [33], [34]. The ordinary
Mach number of the LISM is often assumed to be M∞ = 2.
At the same time the magnitude of the LISM magnetic ﬁeld,
10−7
although not known very well, is estimated within 7
10−6 Gauss [3]. This means, as will be shown later,
and 3
that the magnetic pressure can exceed the value of the ther-
mal pressure and is the reason of including magnetic ﬁeld into
consideration. Its inﬂuence can be especially effective when
the charge-exchange processes are included, since both this
effects lead to the decrease of the effective Mach number.
This means that the LISM ﬂow can become subsonic and the
bow shock can disappear (see also [33] and [104]). The stellar
wind–interstellar medium interaction with taking into account
magnetic ﬁeld was ﬁrst studied in [59], although some of the
results seem to be misinterpreted (see [12]). In the latter pa-
per the problem was investigated by the shock-ﬁtting method
only in the upwind part of the ﬂow due to the limitations of
the numerical scheme. In [80] the solution was presented of
the axisymmetric problem (the LISM magnetic ﬁeld strength
vector was assumed to be parallel to its velocity vector) of the
SW–LISM interaction in the closed region surrounding the
star. In [34] the shape of the heliopause was studied on the ba-
sis of the Newtonian approach in the 3D case of the arbitrary
angle between the LISM magnetic ﬁeld and velocity vectors.
The authors found this shape approximately by equating the
values of the total pressure on the both sides of the heliopause.
In [81] this problem was ﬁrst examined numerically.

The complicated pattern of the ﬂow containing a number of
interacting shocks, enhanced by various physical phenomena,
makes it a challenging problem for the application of modern
numerical methods invented for pure gasdynamic and magne-
togasdynamic application. Numerical solution of this problem
is often associated with the solution of such accompanying
problems as non-reﬂecting boundary conditions, numerical
implementation of the condition of the magnetic charge ab-
sence, etc. These problems are of general importance for the
young, but quickly developing, ﬁeld called computational
ﬂuid dynamics. In Section 2 of this review we present the
mathematical statement of the problem, write out the system
of governing equations and boundary conditions. The choice
of initial conditions for the magnetogasdynamic (MHD) in-
teraction is discussed. In Section 3 we discuss stationary so-
lutions of the gasdynamic problem on the basis of shock-
ﬁtting and shock-capturing methods. In Section 4 different
approaches are discussed which take into account the charge-
exchange processes. In Section 5 we describe instabilities
originating under certain circumstances in this problem and
the reasons causing them. In Section 6 nonstationary solutions
are considered resulting from the solar wind disturbances and
its periodicity. In Section 7 we brieﬂy discuss the effects of
the solar wind spatial asymmetry. And, ﬁnally, Section 8 deals
with numerical modeling of the solar wind interaction with
the magnetized interstellar medium.

2 Mathematical statement of the problem

To make the paper more concise, we write out in this section
the mathematical statement of the problem based on the MHD
equations. The Euler gasdynamic equations can be easily ob-
tained from the former one by omitting the terms containing
the magnetic ﬁeld strength and the equations describing the
behavior of its components.

2.1 The system of governing equations

The system of governing equations for a MHD ﬂow of an
ideal, inﬁnitely conducting, perfect plasma in the Cartesian
coordinate system x, y, z, shown in Fig. 2 (y-axis is perpen-
dicular to the picture plane), can be written as follows (one

Initial and boundary conditions

Calculations are usually performed in the computational re-
gion between the inner and the outer spherical surface (cir-
cular in the axisymmetric case). The ﬂow from the Sun is
supposed to be supersonic at the termination shock distance.
For this reason we specify all parameter values at the inner
boundary sphere. The uniform LISM ﬂow is also supersonic
and we can specify the parameter values at the inﬂow side of
the outer boundary. The treatment of outﬂow boundary can be
more complicated. In [96] all parameters were extrapolated
with the zeroth order along the ﬂuid particle trajectory. This
approach cannot be expected suitable for deeply subsonic out-
ﬂow boundary. Another approach was proposed in [92]. This
method is based on introducing imaginary cells next to the
boundary. These cells are ﬁlled with the LISM gas at inﬁn-
ity. To ﬁnd the ﬂux through the outer boundary the Riemann
problem is solved between the imaginary and the adjacent
cell values. At the boundary segments with the subsonic–
supersonic transition the rarefaction wave relations are used.
This results in the following interpretation (see [75] and [78])
of the method initially developed for a purely gasdynamic
case and makes possible its extension to MHD problems [80].
Consider the method based on the two strictly nonreﬂect-
ing conditions: the well-known extrapolation condition for
a supersonic exit that provides a characteristically compati-
ble approximation of the equations on the boundary and the
procedure [75], [78], developed earlier for gasdynamic ﬂows.
The idea of application of the relations in the rarefaction
wave for the realization of the far-ﬁeld boundary conditions
lies in the artiﬁcial locating of the sonic point on the exit boun-
dary. If the ﬂow is supersonic at inﬁnity such a procedure gives
reasonable results and allows one to perform calculations in
the cases for which other known approaches fail. The interpre-
tation of our method is the following. Assume that parameters
inside the chosen computational region fully deﬁne the ﬂow
behavior outside the boundary. In the case of subsonic exit
the only possible elementary Riemann problem conﬁguration
for the above system is a rarefaction wave whose fan covers
the boundary. In this case, if the self-similar variable value
is known, we can locally continue the internal ﬁeld to the
boundary. That is why, an additional condition is that the ﬂow
velocity attains the sonic value there.

Consider the hyperbolic system for the vector U of un-
known variables in the vicinity of the boundary (the right one

for deﬁniteness) in the form

∂U
∂t

+ A

= 0 ,

∂U
∂x

(4)

where U = U(x,t), and x is the variable in the direction
normal to the boundary G
, t is time, and A(U) is the coef-
ﬁcient matrix with a complete set of eigenvectors and only
real eigenvalues. We seek the solution in the form of a simple
wave U = U(x,t) = U(ξ), where ξ = x
t . By substituting this
representation into Eq. (4), we obtain

(A

λI)Uξ = 0, λ = ξ ,

(5)

−

where I is the identity matrix. Owing to Eq. (5), the vector Uξ
is the eigenvector of A for the eigenvalue λ = ξ. This means
that we need to solve the following system of ordinary differ-
ential equations supplemented by the nondifference relation:

Uξ = d(U,λ)r(U,λ) , λ(U) = ξ ,

(6)

where r is the right eigenvector (the vector-column) of A
deﬁned up to the scalar multiplier d. The eigenvalue in the
rarefaction wave varies like λ(U) = ξ. This condition com-
pletes the system for determining U and d. While realizing
this boundary condition we must integrate Eq. (6) over ξ from
ξ0 = λ(U0), where U0 represents the initial subsonic param-
eters inside the region, to ξ = ξG = 0, that is, to the sonic
point. Consider this approach, ﬁrst, for pure gas dynamics.
Let us choose the vector of unknowns in Eq. (4) in the form
U = (ρ,u,v,w,a)T, where ρ is the density, u is the velocity
vector component normal to G
, v and w are its tangential com-
ponents, and a is the speed of sound. The minimum eigenvalue
in this case is λ = u

The index “0” indicates the values belonging to the inner
region. On the discreet mesh this means that they are taken
from the center (or from the left side) of the cell adjacent to
the boundary. Equations (10) must be supplemented by the
condition at the supersonic exit if (u/a)0

1: UG = U0.

These conditions are mutually consistent and coincide for
u0 = a0. Note that in this case we did not need the explicit
expression for d which can be easily found from the second
and the ﬁfth equations in (8). Besides the exact derivation
based on the relations in the rarefaction wave, we give here
the approximate relations keeping in mind such systems for
which no exact expressions of this kind can be written out.
For this purpose we ﬁrst exclude d by substituting the ﬁrst
equation from (8) into the other ones. Then we obtain

The approach described above turned out to give stable re-
sults in contrast to the attempts of a straight application of the
well-known non-reﬂecting boundary conditions, say, [102]. It
is worth mentioning in this connection that a comprehensive
review (more than 200 references) of various versions and
modiﬁcations of non-reﬂecting boundary conditions can be
found in [43] and [44] (see also [37] and [102]).

As initial values the jump can be chosen between the SW
and the LISM parameters at a ﬁxed distance Rf from the
Sun smaller than the TS stand-off distance. For R < Rf the
SW parameter distribution is speciﬁed. The magnetic ﬁeld
pressure in this region is supposed to be negligibly small
comparing with the SW hydrodynamic pressure, thus Be = 0.
For R > Rf the uniform distribution of the LISM pressure and
density is assumed. If we solve an MHD problem, that is, the
LISM ﬂow is magnetized, it is wise to specify a magnetic ﬁeld
strength distribution satisfying the divergence-free condition.
For this reason the magnetic and the velocity ﬁeld in the LISM
and in the SW ﬂow are initially joined in the computational

region so that B conserves a constant angle with v and div B =
0. This is done by assuming for R > Rf

Here U, V, and W represent the spherical components of
the velocity vector in the directions R, φ, and θ, respectively.
This distribution corresponds to an incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow
velocity distribution over a sphere, directed along the z-axis
(θ-axis). The magnetic ﬁeld is initialized in the same way,
except that the ﬁeld conﬁguration is rotated about the y-axis
so that the magnetic ﬁeld vector is tilted with respect to the
velocity vector by the desired angle.

If neutral particles are to be taken into account, we must

specify their number density and velocity at the inﬂow.

3 Stationary gasdynamic calculations

A gasdynamic model for the SW interaction with the super-
sonic interstellar wind was ﬁrst suggested in [7]. A cylindri-
cal formulation was adopted which corresponds to a uniform
LISM ﬂow and a spherically-symmetric SW. The calculations
were performed on the basis of a simpliﬁed thin-layer approx-
imation. The solar wind was assumed to be decelerated mainly
in the process of its interaction with the charged component,
or plasma component, of the LISM. With the latter assump-
tion calculations can also be made without simpliﬁcations
using the Euler gasdynamic equations. Both shock-ﬁtting and
shock-capturing approaches can be found in publications and
we describe them brieﬂy in the following subsections.

3.1 Shock-ﬁtting methods

Taking into account the adopted two-shock model with the
contact discontinuity between the shocks, one can easily use
shock-ﬁtting methods in the upwind part of the interaction
region. The idea of this approach lies in the subdivision of
the computational region into subregions of smooth ﬂow. In
these smooth subregions any numerical scheme of sufﬁcient
order of accuracy can be used. Derivatives in this approach
must never be approximated by ﬁnite differences across dis-
continuities. The latter are traced as boundary lines. Proper
jump relations are used to determine the change of parameters
across these boundaries and their new position in the course
of time. This approach is very economical, since 1) you need
not perform calculations in the regions of the uniform LISM
and the spherically-symmetric SW, which are known before-
hand, thus reducing the size of the computational domain
and 2) you can avoid spurious oscillations around disconti-
nuities inherent in application of shock-capturing methods.
For this reason one can use linear high-order of accuracy
numerical schemes not worrying about high non-oscillatory

Figure 3. Self-similar picture of shock wave position [7]

resolution of discontinuities. In the shock-ﬁtting method their
position and intensity are determined exactly. Certain difﬁ-
culties originate if two or more discontinuities are interacting
with each other. In this case, in principle, one can still use a
shock-ﬁtting approach using exact solutions for the problems
of a discontinuity interaction. The algorithm, however, can
become rather complicated (see [60], [61], [62], and [64]).
In the shock-ﬁtting approach a quasi-linear form of the sys-
tem of governing equations is usually chosen rather than a
conservation-law form.

On the basis of the shock-ﬁtting approach the problem
under consideration was ﬁrst solved in [7] by the Babenko–
Rusanov implicit scheme [4]. Due to the limitations of the
numerical approach only upwind part of the interaction was
calculated. A polar coordinate system R, θ was used and cal-
culations were performed in the region restricted by the ray
θ = θmax at which the velocity normal to this boundary
remained supersonic. The system of linear algebraic equa-
tions on the computational grid was solved together with
the Rankine–Hugoniot conservation relations and the rela-
tions on the contact discontinuity. The computational region
was located between the termination and the bow shock. The
steady-state solution was obtained as t
with the boun-
dary conditions independent of time.

A physicist usually seeks dimensionless similarity param-
eters of the problem. For the considered problem they are
represented by the Mach numbers Me and M∞ of the SW

and the LISM ﬂow, respectively, the ratios of their dynamic
pressures K = neV 2
∞ and stagnation temperatures
χ = Te0/T∞0. The speciﬁc heat ratio γ is usually adopted to
be equal to 5/3 which corresponds to the fully ionized plasma.
If neutral particles are not taken into account, the ﬂow from
the inner side of TS becomes hypersonic and, therefore, the
results are only weakly dependent on the choice of Me taken
at 1 AU. Though results formally depend on χ (say, for χ = 1
the density jump over CD is absent) an analysis of conser-
vation relations on the discontinuities in the upwind part of
the interaction region make us conclude that they can be re-
calculated using results for one particular value of χ. As K is
the similarity parameter (see [5] and [7]), for the hypersonic
solar wind and K > 1 the results are independent of K if the
√K. In Fig. 3, the
distances are measured in units of 1AU
shapes of the outer (F) and of the inner (G) shock wave, the
contact surface (S) and some streamlines are presented for the
case M∞ = 2.

×

In [113] a new shock-ﬁtting numerical algorithm was de-
scribed and applied to the problem under consideration that
provided results with such a high accuracy that in the upwind
part of the interaction it may represent a testing benchmark
for all newly developed methods. This method is based on the
composite explicit-implicit ﬁnite-difference scheme [86]. The
well-known explicit Lax–Wendroff and the implicit Babenko
scheme [4] represent its constituent parts. The algorithm is
organized in such a way that depending on the CFL num-
ber value either explicit or implicit approximation is used.
This approach makes the proposed method more economical
than a purely implicit scheme. Among the schemes based on

this approach we can also mention [53] and [74]. The latter
method is the extension of MacCormack’s explicit-implicit
scheme for the steady Euler equations hyperbolic with re-
spect to one of the space coordinates. A steady-state solution
of the SW–LISM interaction was obtained in [113] by a quasi-
marching method in which nonstationary problem was solved
for t
for each radial ray. Such an approach also allowed
to save a computational time comparing with a direct solution
of the nonstationary system. One of the computational results
is shown in Fig 4.

→ ∞

One must admit here that, in contrast to the results from
[7], calculations were performed for a rather long distance
in the downwind direction, actually until the ﬂow along the
z-axis shown in Fig. 4 remained supersonic. This resulted
in a considerable unjustiﬁable elongation of the termination
shock, as will be seen from the subsequent subsection. The
discrepancy between the results is caused by the limitation of
the quasi-marching approach that cannot take into account the
Mach-type reﬂection of the inner shock from the symmetry
axis. Nevertheless, the results are without any doubt quite
reliable up to a certain distance in the wake region. No need
to mention that the time necessary for obtaining the steady-
state solution in this case is considerably less than that in the
case of applying shock-capturing methods.

3.2 Shock-capturing methods

In shock-capturing methods we calculate ﬁnite differences
across discontinuities. This may cause spurious oscillations
of the solution if non-monotone numerical schemes are used.
On the other hand, all linear schemes of the order of accuracy
higher than one are non-monotone [38]. For this reason one
or another artiﬁcial viscosity must be used [85] or nonlinear
numerical schemes ought to be applied. It is not our task to
give a review of high-resolution TVD (total variation dimin-
ishing) schemes in this paper (see [42] and [112] for a regular
mathematical background). Although both ﬁnite-difference
and ﬁnite-volume methods can be equivalently applied in the
latter schemes, we shall dwell mainly on the ﬁnite-volume for-
mulation and monotonic upstream schemes for conservation
laws (MUSCL) approach, since they are more descriptive.

To solve axisymmetric system (2), let us introduce a polar

Here ¯E is the ﬂux normal to the boundary, deﬁned as:

¯E = n1E + n2G,

(22)

where n = (n1,n2) is a unit outward vector normal to the cell
surface.

Equation (21) has a time-discretized conservation-law form
for an individual computational cell. Various numerical sche-
mes are speciﬁed by the method chosen to calculate the nu-
merical ﬂux ¯E through the cell boundary surfaces. In [96]
the two-step Lax–Wendroff scheme is used with the second
order of accuracy. As usual for such schemes, an additional
smoothing must be introduced to remove high-frequency os-
cillations and overshoots and undershoots originating near
smeared shocks owing to the non-monotonicity of the scheme.
Another possible ﬂux calculation formulas which also include
artiﬁcial viscosity were applied in [70]. It is based on the
ZEUS fractional step code [98]. All methods using artiﬁcial
viscosity for oscillation damping contain an empirical vis-
cosity coefﬁcient which must be adjusted in a way suitable
for any particular problem. The compromise is between the
effective monotonization of the solution and its deterioration.
Nonlinear high-resolution numerical schemes are free from
this drawback.

To attain the second order of accuracy in space, a piecewise-
linear distribution of parameters inside computational cells
can be adopted [112]. One can use the simplest “minmod”
reconstruction procedure

The ﬂuxes ¯E(UR,UL) through the cell surfaces can be found
by different methods. Wide recognition acquired TVD shock-
capturing methods based on the exact or some of the approxi-
mate solutions to the Riemann problem. The ﬁrst steady-state
solution of the SW–LISM interaction problem in the closed
region surrounding the star was obtained in [92] on the basis of
the Osher approximate Riemann problem solver [24]. In this

D
approach an approximate solution to the Riemann problem
is formed using elementary simple waves which correspond
to deﬁnite eigenvectors of the Euler gasdynamic system and
separate the regions of the constant ﬂow. In the exact solu-
tion, a rarefaction wave, a contact discontinuity and a shock
wave generally appear in various combinations. In the approx-
imate solution used in [92] shock waves are approximated by
compression waves. This approach connects parameter val-
ues on the right and on the left side of the computational cell
by a number of algebraic relations. Such approach, however,
seems to be more time-consuming than that based on Roe’s
solution of the linearized Riemann problem [88] (see also
a comprehensive description of characteristic-based schemes
for the Euler equations [89]). A numerical ﬂux in this case is
calculated as follows:

The important peculiarity of the latter method is that, al-
though it gives the solution of the linearized problem, the exact
satisfaction of the Rankine–Hugoniot relations on shocks pro-
vides their more adequate and sharp resolution. This method
was applied to the problem under consideration in [55] and
[75].

peratures χ = T0e/T0∞ of SW and LISM. This corresponds
to the following values of dimensionless parameters of the
problem: M∞ = 2, Me = 5, χ = 400, K = 6250. The spe-
ciﬁc heat ratios for SW and LISM are supposed to be 5/3. The
calculation is performed in the ring region with the inner and
outer circle radii being Rmin = 10 and Rmax = 500 AU with
99 and 116 cells in the radial and in the angular direction, re-
spectively. Constant pressure (below the symmetry axis) and
constant density natural logarithm contours of the steady-state
solution are presented in Fig. 5. Results are given in the polar

All peculiarities are seen of the shock wave pattern shown

Calculations for a large variety of the stellar wind and in-
terstellar medium parameters, including those very different
from the parameters of the solar wind, were performed in [55]
and [92]. These parametric studies may reﬂect various situ-
ations corresponding to ejecting stars and their environment.
Although from the purely gasdynamic viewpoint the LISM
ﬂow is supersonic, the presence of the interstellar magnetic
ﬁeld and charge-exchange processes can decrease the effec-
tive Mach number of the uniform interstellar medium ﬂow,
thus making it subsonic. For this reason several authors [93],
[97] performed calculations of a subsonic interaction on the

admit that, although application of shock-ﬁtting methods can
provide a solution with a very high precision at low computa-
tional costs, they can be used only in the ﬂow regions with a
simple shock-wave pattern which is known beforehand (say,
the upwind part of the SW–LISM interaction). Attempts to
promote calculations for larger distances into the downwind
region results in the substantial distortion of the results, like
it was in [113], in which the possibility of the Mach-type re-
ﬂection of the termination shock was not taken into account.
A shock-ﬁtting method in its rigorous sense was not real-
ized, since the exact relations connecting parameters in the
triple point were not used. The best way out in this case is
to combine shock-ﬁtting and shock-capturing methods, as it
was done in [11].

Since we restrict ourselves in this review to the description
of numerical methods used to solve the SW–LISM interac-
tion problem, more or less complete description of physical
processes governing the charge exchange between the plasma
and the neutral component of the ﬂow lies beyond the scope
of this work. It can be found in the corresponding references
mentioned in Introduction. However, it is quite clear that the
LISM is a partially ionized gas and, therefore, a consistent
model must be developed accounting for the mutual inﬂuence
of charged and neutral particles. Although both helium and
hydrogen atoms are present, the authors usually disregard he-
lium atoms, since their cosmic abundance is much less than
that of hydrogen atoms.

The ﬁrst attempts to estimate the inﬂuence of this process,
say, [7] and [87], did not include the inﬂuence of the hydro-
gen atoms on the plasma component. The ﬁrst self-consistent
model of the heliospheric interface was suggested in [8]. In
that paper the authors introduced the source terms account-
ing for the momentum and the energy transfer between the
two components into the system of the Euler gasdynamic
equations in the quasi-linear form. These source terms were
presented in the form:

basis of the Euler equations. It is quite clear that, unlike the
two-shock Baranov’s model, no bow shock can appear in the
stationary solution. As will be shown later, the termination
shock in this case does not have a bullet shape and the dif-
ference between its stand-off distances in the upwind and in
the downwind direction is not so pronounced. This can also
be seen in Fig. 6, corresponding to M∞ = 0.6. If the stel-
lar wind Mach number is larger than that of the solar wind,
the termination shock becomes elongated in the backward di-
rection and the size of the Mach disk diminishes (see Fig 7,
corresponding to M∞ = 5). The latter two ﬁgures are taken
from [93].

Summarizing the subject of this section, we would like to

The hydrogen atoms were assumed to conserve their ve-
locity and temperature in the process of their interaction with
protons and the origin of the secondary hydrogen atoms was
neglected. That allowed to describe the behavior of neutrals
in the region between the two shocks by the system

TH = TH∞ = const,

Incorporating this source term into implicit method [4] does
not represent any difﬁculty and the solution was obtained for
various values of dimensionless parameters. The major ef-
fect of charge exchange on the heliospheric interfaces is to
decrease the distances to the TS, HP, and BS. The original
developers of the approach [8], which considers the ﬂow of
neutral particles as a hydrodynamic ﬂow, themselves admit-
ted in [9] its main drawbacks: (1) such description is hardly
justiﬁable, since the mean free-path of the hydrogen atoms
is not smaller than the characteristic length of the problem;
(2) the Maxwellian distribution of the atoms was adopted to
calculate the plasma momentum and energy losses. This was
the reason of applying the Monte-Carlo method for simulation
of the hydrogen atom trajectories [54]. It gives a possibility
to evaluate the source terms in the momentum and the en-
ergy equations for the plasma component on the basis of the
kinetic description of the hydrogen atoms. An iteration me-
thod [10] was proposed to solve both systems of equations.
The numerical results are discussed in [11] and [12]. This
approach is nowadays the only one which can be considered
physically consistent from the viewpoint of computational
ﬂuid dynamics. In Fig. 8, the geometrical interface between
the two ﬂows is presented [11] reﬂecting the inﬂuence of the
charge exchange processes. The picture is presented in the
X0Z plane, where 0Z coincides with the axis of symmetry
and is antiparallel to the vector on the LISM velocity (the Sun
is in the coordinate system origin). The solid and the dotted
lines in Fig. 8 correspond to nH∞ = 0.14 cm−3 and nH∞ = 0,
respectively. The parameters of the plasma component were
the following: ne = 7 cm−3, Ve = 450 km/s, Me = 10,
n∞ = 0.07 cm−3, V∞ = 25 km/s, and M∞ = 2. One can
see a large inﬂuence of the described processes on the ﬂow
pattern and it is quite clear that any realistic calculation of the
problem must take them into consideration.

Recently in [70] and [115] the simpliﬁed approach [8]
was modiﬁed by developing the multiﬂuid description for
the neutrals which tried to take into account the highly non-
Maxwellian nature of the neutral distribution. Since in these
papers the plasma was assumed Maxwellian only in each
region between the discontinuity surfaces, the neutral popula-
tion produced by the charge exchange in these regions has the
same basic characteristics as those of the plasma component.
Although this approach still remains approximate, one must
admit that it allowed its developers to obtain the solutions
of the three-dimensional and nonstationary problems which
have not been solved yet on the basis of the Monte-Carlo
method.

5 Hydrodynamic instabilities in the

SW–LISM interaction

As was admitted in [106], the contact discontinuity between
the inner and the outer subsonic region is potentially the sub-
ject to the ﬂuid Kelvin–Helmholtz or MHD ﬂute instabilities
which could produce some of the inhomogeneous structures
of astropause tails. The study of instabilities accompanying
the problem of the SW–LISM interaction with and without
magnetic ﬁeld is an important independent task which lies
outside the scope of this review. We are going to clarify here
only the effect of the choice of numerical methods on their
origin and development in the problem in which two ﬂows
possessing substantially different entropies collide at a con-
tact surface calculated by shock-capturing methods. It is more
or less clear that discontinuity-ﬁtting methods are hardly ap-
plicable for this task.

As was convincingly shown in [58] and [93], complicated
nonstationary patterns can be obtained owing to the Rayleigh–
Taylor instabilities if the interaction is accompanied by the
gravitational effect from the star. In the case of the solar wind
the gravity can be neglected, since the Hoyle–Littleton accre-
tion radius is about 4.5 AU, which is much smaller than the
expected location of the termination shock. In [55], however,
the stellar wind–interstellar medium interaction was studied
for parameters different from those corresponding to the solar
wind and the results were obtained clearly indicating insta-
bility of the ﬂow. The Osher numerical scheme [24] was used
and an algebraically generated irregular grid rather than the
polar one applied in the previous study of the problem [93].
That type of the grid is supposed to give a ﬁner resolution at
large distances from the ejecting center. The inﬂuence of the
interstellar medium Mach number was studied in a wide range
from M∞ = 0.6 to 15. A highly nonstationary solution was
obtained in this case, instabilities originating both near the
astropause stagnation point and in its lateral region (Fig. 9).
The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability in the latter region are
quite possible as the gases with different entropy move along
the both sides of a contact surface at different speeds. The
origin of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability near the stagnation

point, however, is questionable, since velocities are very small
there. Such stagnation point instabilities, however, were found
earlier in the calculations of astrophysical jets [65], [66], and
[95]. Similar instabilities were also found in [56] and [57]
in the calculations of opposing and forward-facing jets. They
were also observed in the experiments [36], [90], and [91].
It is worth mentioning, however, that the instabilities of the
latter type were not obtained in the calculations for parame-
ters close to the solar wind – interstellar medium interaction,
as was reported in [96]. Moreover, N. Pogorelov in his cal-
culations occasionally obtained instabilities near the stagna-
tion point, even for a rather rough mesh, using the Roe-type
MUSCL scheme under unfavorable selection of the parame-
ter reconstruction method. Note that one or another parameter
interpolation based on the assumption of the linear, parabolic
[25], or higher-order distributions inside computational cells
is usually used to increase the order of accuracy of the chosen
numerical scheme. Say, in [75] and [76] the interpolation of
characteristic variables was used which had been discovered
to give much more stable results in the vicinity of the geo-
metrical singularities at θ = 0 and θ = π. Note that both the
polar grid used in [76] and the algebraically generated O-type
grid incorporated into the algorithm [55] possess such a sin-
gularity. In [80] the choice of the form of governing equations
(2) or (3) was claimed to have a certain effect on the stability
of results.

There also exits another aspect of the problem. As was
mentioned in the previous section, the interaction between
the interstellar atoms and the solar plasma ions via resonant
charge-exchange collisions greatly affects the steady-state
structure of the global heliosphere. The ﬂow of interstellar
ions is diverted around the nose of the heliopause, whereas
the neutral particles penetrate into the heliosphere impeded
aside from the charge-exchange collisions. Thus, there is a ve-
locity difference between them near the nose which performs
like a drag force acting on the plasma (see Eq. 28). Since the
LISM density is larger at the heliopause than that of the SW,
the contact surface is potentially Rayleigh–Taylor unstable.
That kind of instability was admitted in [52] and [115]. Its
origin was conﬁrmed by several numerical experiments, in-
cluding the one applying the entirely different particle-in-cell
code [20], and by comparing the instability linear growth rate
with the theoretical one. However, as was admitted earlier,
the multiﬂuid hydrodynamic model in which all ﬂiuds were
supposed to be in a local thermal equilibrium was used in
the above-mentioned papers to determine the motion of the
neutral particles. This makes the obtained results questionable
from the viewpoint of the spatial scale of instabilities. Paper
[52] also neglects the effect of energetic solar wind neutrals
created by the charge exchange inside the heliopause. The
drag force caused by these neutrals tends to compensate the
inward force described earlier and partially suppress the in-
stability.

The study of hydrodynamic instabilities originating in the
SW–LISM interaction problem is far from its conclusion also
due to a number of physical phenomena that can affect it,

such as, the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld, cosmic rays, etc. It is
important to admit in this review that, investigating instabili-
ties, one must be very careful in order to distinguish those of
physical and of numerical origin.

6 Nonstationary SW–LISM interaction

As was mentioned above and is widely accepted, the solar
wind changes its speed from supersonic to subsonic through
a termination shock. A number of reasons can cause tempo-
ral asymmetries of the termination shock and, therefore, the
interaction pattern as a whole. Among them are disturbances
of the solar wind and its 11-year periodicity. Due to these
reasons the heliospheric shock will move in response to vari-
ation in upstream solar wind conditions. In [100], a kinematic
analysis is made of the solar wind driven temporal variations
in the heliospheric termination shock distance. In [15], [16],
and [63] the motion of this shock was analyzed analytically
on the basis of one-dimensional gasdynamic model. It was
admitted that the termination shock would rather be nonsta-
tionary and would resemble a distorted asymmetric balloon
with some part moving inward and others moving backward.
In [97] the termination shock response to large-scale solar
wind ﬂuctuations were studied numerically using the Lax–
Wendroff scheme. The LISM ﬂow was assumed subsonic.
In [47], on the basis of the similar numerical method 11-
year solar wind variation inﬂuence on the inner shock was
investigated. In [75] and [76] nonstationary problems were
modeled by a numerical solution of the Euler gasdynamic
equations (2) in the ﬁnite-volume formulation (21) using a
MUSCL-type TVD high-resolution numerical scheme. The
suggestion was made of a piecewise-linear distribution of the
characteristic parameters inside the cells to determine the val-
ues at their boundaries and slope limiters were used to attain
a TVD property. The results presented below were obtained
using the formulas [1]:

The LISM proton number density was assumed to be
nH+ = 1 cm−3. The velocity of LISM relative to the so-
lar system is about 20 km/s, while the speed of sound of
the LISM gas is about 10 km/s. The SW protons number
density was adopted nH+ = 10 cm−3, while its velocity is
Ve
100 km/s at the
distance of the Earth’s orbit (1 AU). This corresponds to the
following values of dimensionless parameters chosen for the
initial data: M∞ = 2, Me = 5, χ = 400, K = 6250. The
stationary initial ﬂow was obtained by the same numerical
method using a time-stabilization approach. The calculation
was performed in the ring region with the inner and outer cir-
cle radii being Rmin = 10 and Rmax = 500 AU. On the inner
surface all parameters were speciﬁed as functions of time by
formulas:

since this boundary is supersonic. Here U is the radial velocity
component. Although the choice of parameters is somewhat
nonrealistic, as far as the solar wind is concerned, it still can
be used for a qualitative analysis of a nonstationary picture of
the interaction.

The initial distributions of pressure (below the symmetry
axis) and density logarithms are shown in Fig. 5. The size of
the outer circle in the ﬁgures is 400 AU. Similar isolines are
presented in Figs. 10–13 at different moments of time (in the
units 1 AU/U∞). The growing part of the disturbance, inter-
acting with the inner shock, moves it, ﬁrst, from the centre,
Fig. 10, the intensity of IS increasing. Later, it tends to achieve
the initial position.

The penetration of the disturbance in the region between
IS and CD is seen on both charts of isolines at different mo-
ments of time. The disturbance, while crossing IS, increases
greatly, and after some time a local pressure maximum orig-
inates between IS and CD (Fig. 11). This leads to the effect
of suction of SW gas to the centre accompanying IS motion
in the same direction. This pressure extremum line gradually
moves towards CD, see Figs. 12–13.

The parts of the computational region more remote from

the source position suffer the same changes later in time.

As soon as the disturbance meets different points of IS,
the latter suffers substantial distortion. When the triple point
on IS is reached, there appear two triple points with dif-
ferent reﬂected shocks and recirculation zone between them

Figure 10. Pressure and density logarithm isolines [75], t = 8

(Fig. 13). As soon as the source intensity becomes constant,
the position of IS gradually, but rather slowly, moves to-
wards its initial position. The maximum increase of MD
stand-off distance is greater than that of IS along the ray
θ = 0.

The relaxation of the ﬂow towards some stationary solution
is very slow (t > 220). When t > 20, in the region near θ = 0
additional local pressure extrema vanish. The extended vortex
region originates behind MD and it is up to t = 60, when these
vortices vanish, probably due to numerical viscosity.

and Me = 5 in the minimum and K = 50000, χ = 400,
M∞ = 2, and Me = 5 in the maximum of the solar activity.
These values are chosen as the basic points for the sine func-
tion approximating the time dependence of K and χ within
11 years. The dimensionless time unit is 86.8 days. The time
step is chosen to be D

corresponding to the stationary solution in the minimum solar
activity is chosen as initial data. The results are obtained by the
MUSCL numerical method described above. The calculation
is performed in the ring region with the inner and the outer
circle radii being Rmin = 14 and Rmax = 700, respectively.

The isolines of the pressure (below the symmetry axis) and
the density logarithms corresponding to the initial data are
shown in Fig. 14. They are presented for the outer circle size
equal to 560 AU. The number of cells is 99 and 116 in the
radial and in the angular direction, respectively. At the initial
stage of the ﬂow development, the increase of the parameter
K results in the TS motion from the Sun. The motion of the
compression wave through TS causes the origin of a new
shock wave propagating from the center. This can be seen
in Fig. 15 corresponding to t = 20. This shock penetrates
through the contact discontinuity and moves towards the bow
shock, see Fig. 16 (t = 36).

The decreasing part of the periodic function causes a back-
ward motion of the termination shock towards the Sun. This
leads to the origin of new ﬂow division surfaces, reverse ﬂow
zones, and vortices of variable size and intensity in the wake
region. At t = 60, see Fig. 17, the size of the bullet shape
termination shock becomes minimum again. Later on a next
nonstationary shock wave appears, etc. A deﬁnite 11-year pe-
riodicity is developed in the shape of the termination shock.

Now we present some results [76] concerning the peri-
odic SW–LISM interaction. In this calculation the LISM pro-
ton number density, its velocity and the speed of sound are
n∞ = 0.1 cm−3, V∞ = 20 km/s and c∞ = 10 km/s, re-
spectively. Parameters of the solar wind change substantially
within the 11-year period of the solar activity. The concentra-
tion of charged particles ne = 1.56 cm−3 and the radial SW
velocity Ve = 400 km/s are chosen for the minimum of the
solar activity, while ne = 8 cm−3 and Ve = 500 km/s corre-
spond to its maximum (see [6] and [21]). Thus, for dimen-

is determined by the propagation of shock waves traveling
one after another and interacting with the less intensive waves
reﬂected from the bow shock (Fig. 18).

This modeling shows that the ﬂow pattern is substantially
nonstationary which must be taken into account when analyz-
ing responses from the space vehicles crossing these disconti-
nuities. Variable solar activity is usually accompanied by the
asymmetry of the solar wind which will be considered in the
next section.

Application of a high-resolution numerical methods allows

one to avoid spurious oscillations near shocks and provides
their sharper resolution using smaller number of computa-
tional cells than it is necessary in nonmonotone schemes with
artiﬁcial viscosity.

7 Nonuniform solar wind – interstellar

medium interaction

Distant solar wind deviations from spherical symmetry in-
duced by the interaction with neutral interstellar hydrogen

due to photoionization and charge-exchange processes were
studied in [40] by a perturbation technique. The penetration of
neutral particles deep inside the heliosphere results in a sub-
stantial increase of the distant solar wind temperature. In all
models described in the previous sections we considered the
stellar (solar) wind as spherically-symmetric. It can fairly eas-
ily become asymmetric, since charge-exchange processes are
clearly more effective in the forward region of the interaction
because their efﬁciency is proportional to the velocity differ-
ence between neutral and charged particles. The perturbation
analysis has shown that a strongly asymmetric distribution
of the neutral hydrogen within the heliosphere causes asym-
metric deceleration and extremely nonuniform distribution of
the distant solar wind temperature, thus leading to non-radial
gradients and ﬂows.

This is, however, only one (external) reason of the solar
wind asymmetry. Another one is determined by a mere vari-
ation of the solar wind symmetry in time within its 11-year
activity period (see, e.g., speculations in [76]). According to
the solar minimum observations by Ulysses, the solar wind
parameters depend on the helioaltitude. These data (see [72]
and [73]) indicate that two large polar coronal holes, one in the
northern and the other in the southern hemisphere, produce
a hotter, lower-density, higher-speed wind comparing with
the ecliptic wind. In [71] the calculations were performed of
a nonuniform solar wind–interstellar medium interaction us-
ing the earlier mentioned three-dimensional time-dependent
ZEUS method [98]. The solar wind boundary conditions were
taken from the published Ulysses data. According to them, the
ram pressure increases 1.5 times from the ecliptic plane to the
solar pole. That is why, the termination shock in the calcula-
tions was found to be elongated along the solar axis which, in
turn, resulted in an increased ﬂow in the ecliptic plane com-
pared with that over the solar poles. The authors reported a
pronounced effect of the solar wind asymmetry on the global
structure of the termination shock and heliopause. Both a two-
shock (supersonic LISM) and a one-shock (subsonic LISM)
model were considered. It is worth mentioning once again in
this connection that, if only the motion of charged particles
is considered, the LISM ﬂow is deﬁnitely supersonic. Pure
gasdynamic subsonic models for the problem under consid-
eration are sometimes used to account for the net effect of
the charge-exchange processes, the inﬂuence of cosmic rays
[35], and interstellar magnetic ﬁeld. The latter subject will be
discussed in the next section.

The paper [71] deﬁnitely indicates, from our viewpoint,
that any realistic model for the SW–LISM interaction must
include both neutral particles, the asymmetry of the solar
wind, and, as a consequence, the solar wind periodicity, since
the asymmetry varies within the solar activity period. This, of
course, does not prevent an investigation of different physical
effects separately.

8 Solar wind interaction with the magnetized

interstellar medium

The presence of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld necessitates
solution of the MHD equations for modeling of the SW–
LISM interaction. The inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁeld becomes
important if a magnetic pressure B2/8π becomes comparable
with a dynamic pressure. Magnetic ﬁeld causes an increase
of the maximum speed of small perturbations in the LISM
ﬂow, especially in the direction normal to the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld, thus resulting in the decrease of the effec-
tive Mach number [33] and [34]. Though the magnitude and
the direction of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld is not perfectly
known, the estimates from [3] indicate the possible impor-
tance of its presence. The value and the direction of the LISM
magnetic ﬁeld can affect the global structure of the interac-
tion not only directly, but also by modulating the distance
between the bow shock and the heliopause which determines
the transparency of this layer for the LISM neutrals. This, in
turn, affects the observed line proﬁles of the solar Lyman-α
backscattered emission and estimates of the LISM parameters
(see the discussion in [12] and [50]). If the LISM magnetic
ﬁeld is not parallel to its velocity, the problem becomes three-
dimensional. Later in the section we discuss the results of
such MHD modeling.

It is worth mentioning, that although the value of the solar
magnetic ﬁeld is often neglected in numerical modeling of
the problem under consideration at the distances of the termi-
nation shock, its inﬂuence is substantial at Earth’s magneto-
sphere distances [68] and [109]. In [107] the global structure
of the outer heliosphere was studied in the axisymmetric for-
mulation for a subsonic interstellar medium with taking into
account a time-varying poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. In [108] and
[67] the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld in the heliosheath was found
to increase with the distance from the Sun. The complicated
three-dimensional nostationary behavior of the ﬂow was stud-
ied which showed the importance of taking this component of
the magnetic ﬁeld into account. We restrict ourselves to noting
this aspect of the problem and will not discuss it below.

8.1 On the eigenvector and eigenvalue
systems of MHD equations

The system of ideal MHD equations in the conservation-law
form is presented by Eq. (1). This system can be directly
rewritten in the quasi-linear form which is more convenient for
the characteristic analysis. It is well-known that the equation
div B = 0 expresses the absence of magnetic charge. It is
also evident that, if magnetic charge is absent initially, it
will not appear mathematically at any time instant. From this
viewpoint the above equation is excessive. If we rewrite the
system of MHD equations [51]

that is, to the one-dimensional convection equation for Bx.
Of course, in the truly one-dimensional problem (all values
depend only on the spatial variable x) one can simply as-
sume Bx
const and omit the corresponding equation. On
the contrary, if we are going to apply the solution of the one-
dimensional MHD Riemann problem to determine the ﬂux
through the cell boundary, such an assumption is too exces-
sive, since only the integral
Bndσ over the whole compu-
tational cell must be equal to zero. Among eigenvalues (32)–
H
(33) the ﬁrst two correspond to the entropy and Bx convection
waves, λ3,4 corresponds to the Alfv´en, or rotational, waves,
and the other ones to the slow and to the fast magnetosonic
wave. Omitting Eq. (34), we reduce the system to 7
7. Both
the extended 8
8 system and the reduced one have real eigen-
values and a degenerate set of eigenvectors. One can easily
derive expressions for them. Otherwise, one can refer to [22],
[83], and [101]. As was admitted in [39] and [84], we can
use the extended system to derive an approximate solution to
the MHD Riemann problem. Another possibility is to derive
7 system and use a convection equation to
formulas for the 7
ﬁnd Bx (x is normal to the cell boundary) on the cell surface.
It is also useful to realize that by collecting the source term

Since the application of high-resolution numerical schemes
to MHD ﬂows and to the problem under consideration, in
particular, has not yet become common (see some tests in
[103]), we give their description in the next subsection.

8.2 High-resolution numerical schemes for

MHD equation

TVD upwind and symmetric differencing schemes have re-
cently become very efﬁcient tool for solving complex multi-
shocked gasdynamic ﬂows. This is due to their robustness for
strong shock wave calculations. A general discussion of the
modern high-resolution shock-capturing methods and their
application for a variety of gasdynamic problems can be
found in [42] and [112]. The extension of these schemes to
the equations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is
not straightforward. First, the exact solution [49] of the MHD
Riemann problem is too multivariant to be used in regular cal-
culations. Second, several different approximate solvers [22],

[23], [26], [41], [77], [84], and [114] applied to MHD equa-
tions are now at the stage of investigation and comparison.

The structure and the simplicity of A depends on the choice
of s. The matrix A is an approximation to the Jacobian matrix

The schemes [22], [23], [41], and [77], [84] are based on
the MHD extensions of Roe’s linearization procedure [88]. In
[22], the attempt of such extension was made and the second
order upwind scheme was constructed that demonstrated sev-
eral advantages in comparison with the Lax–Friedrichs, the
Lax–Wendroff, and the ﬂux-corrected transport scheme [30].
Roe’s procedure, however, turned out to be realizable only for
the special case with the speciﬁc heat ratio γ = 2. The reason
of such behavior of MHD equations is that there is not any
single averaging procedure to ﬁnd a frozen Jacobian matrix
of the system. Another linearization approach is used in [23],
[41], [77], and [84] in which the linearized Jacobian matrix
is not a function of a single averaged set of variables, but
depends in a complicated way on the variables on the right-
and on the left-hand side of the computational cell surface. In
[79] and [82] this procedure was shown to be nonunique. A
multiparametric family of linearized MHD approximate Rie-
mann problem solutions was presented that assured an exact
satisfaction of the conservation relations on discontinuities. A
proper choice of parameters is necessary to avoid physically
inconsistent solutions.

The solution of this kind was ﬁrst constructed for the equa-
tions of ideal gas dynamics [88]. In [22] such solution was
given for Eq. (36) in the case γ = 2. The approximate solution
for an arbitrary adiabatic index was proposed in [41]. Here
we present the procedure for obtaining the extension of Roe’s
linearization procedure for MHD equation and show that it is
not unique. Thus, the solution from [41] is the particular case
of the multiparametric family of approximate solutions to the
MHD Riemann problem.

The roots af and as are the largest and the least root of
Eq. (39) ( the fast and the slow magnetosonic waves) and b

corresponds to the entropy waves.

The peculiarity of our approach lies in the strict ordering of
the eigenvalues. This provides the absence of their additional
nonphysical degeneration which is not inherent in J. Note that
the choice of other parameter vectors s can break this property.
In particular, such a degeneration appears if qy and qz are not
proportional to Y and Z, respectively. This leads to the most
simple admissible choice of θ: θ1 = θ2 = 1. In the MHD
case, in contrast to pure gas dynamics, it is not possible to
construct the matrix A depending on a single average vector.

this regularization introduces the error of the second order of
smallness and does not prevent its application for constructing
the solutions of the second order of accuracy. It does not distort
the solution for the MHD jumps, since in this case α

We also have β
0 for the above choice of η1 and η2. Such
an approach preserves the jump relations and is intermediate
between the techniques using the exact expression for A =
D F/D U [22], [41], and [88] and approaches using different
approximations to A.

The family of approximate solutions to the MHD Riemann
problem presented here generalizes the known approximate
quasi-linearized and linearized solutions of this problem and
preserves the Hugoniot-type relations on the jumps. By using
proper reconstruction techniques, we can increase the order
of accuracy of obtaining the ﬂuxes in Eq. (38). In this case the
indices “1” and “2” must be attributed to the parameter values
on the right and on the left side of the computational cell.

Due to the complexity of formulas, this approach is much
more cumbersome than Roe’s linearization method in pure gas
dynamics. Recently in [26], a nonlinear approximate Riemann
problem solver is suggested in which all the waves emanat-
ing from the initial discontinuity are treated as discontinuous
jumps. That is why, it is applicable only for weak rarefactions.
Moreover, the solver proposed is somewhat time-consuming
and sensitive to the initial approximation for the iteration pro-
cess.

Taking into account the above-mentioned remarks some
simpliﬁed approaches are welcome which should (1) satisfy
TVD property and (2) be enough economical and robust.

In [14], the second order of accuracy in time and space
TVD Lax–Friedrichs type scheme is suggested that gives a
great simpliﬁcation of the numerical algorithm in the ﬁnite-
volume formulation comparing with the schemes which use
the precise characteristic splitting of Jacobian matrices. The
results obtained by this scheme were compared with those
from [22] and [27] and a good agreement was observed. In
this scheme we substitute the diagonal eigenvalue matrix in
Eq. (38) by the diagonal matrix with the spectral radius (the
maximum of eigenvalue magnitudes) of A on its diagonal.
Using the proper parameter reconstruction to ﬁnd their values
on the computational cell surfaces, we obtain the second order
of accuracy.

This scheme is less dissipative than the original Lax–
Friedrichs scheme and can be applied to calculations of dis-
continuous MHD ﬂows. Being much simpler than the scheme
based on Roe’s linearization method, it still gives numerical
results with the reasonable accuracy.

Another important subject of discussion is that certain
initial- and boundary-value problems can be solved non-
uniquely using different shocks or different combinations of
shocks, whereas physically one would expect only unique so-
lutions. The situation differs from that in pure gas dynamics,

where all entropy-increasing solutions are evolutionary and
physically admissible. This means that the necessary condi-
tions of the well-posedness for the linearized problem of their
interaction with small disturbances are satisﬁed. In MHD case,
on the contrary, the condition of the entropy increase is neces-
sary, but not sufﬁcient. Only slow and fast MHD shocks turned
out to be evolutionary, while intermediate (or improper slow)
shocks are to be excluded [45] and [49]. Nonevolutionary
shocks are not simply unstable in ideal MHD. Their decay
into evolutionary jumps occurs under inﬁnitesimal perturba-
tion within inﬁnitesimal time. On the other hand, numerical
viscosity (including the presence of ﬁnite conductivity) and
numerical dispersion of a numerical scheme make such inter-
mediate structures existent for a certain time interval before
their destruction. It is very important to realize that this in-
terval has nothing to do with the real interval of existence
of intermediate waves in non-ideal plasma and is grid- and
numerical scheme-dependent. If the viscosity and/or the con-
ductivity are substantial, such compound structure can exist
for a long time depending on the amount of viscosity. This
was admitted and used for the explanation of certain physical
phenomena in [111].

In [22], the ideal MHD Riemann problem was solved with
initial data consisting of two constant states lying to the right
and to the left of the centerline of the computational domain.
Being solved as a strictly coplanar problem, it included a
nonevolutionary compound shock. Such shocks must decay
and are not realizable in physical problems. The peculiarity of
MHD is that there exist discontinuities that are nonevolution-
ary only with respect to Alfv´enic (rotational) disturbances.
That is why, if a strictly coplanar problem is considered (ve-
locity and magnetic ﬁeld vectors lie in the same plane and the
system of MHD equations includes only two vector compo-
nents) the construction of the solution is possible both with
evolutionary and nonevolutionary shock waves. The solution
in this case is nonunique. If the full set of three-dimensional
MHD equations is solved and a small tangential disturbance
is added to the magnetic ﬁeld vector, a rotational jump splits
from the compound wave and it degrades into the slow shock.
This means that the compound wave is unstable against tan-
gential disturbances and is nonevolutionary in three dimen-
sions (see [14]). That means that one must be very careful
reducing the dimension of the system (say, in axisymmetric
problems) to avoid the origin of nonadmissible solutions. The
necessity of three-dimensional consideration of MHD Rie-
mann problems has been admitted recently in [26]. One must
take into account this feature of MHD equations in the con-
struction of numerical algorithms. In other words, if we are
going to solve an axisymmetric problem, in general, a full set
of three-dimensional equations must be used.

8.3 Shock-ﬁtting calculations

In [13] the interaction between the solar wind and the magne-
tized plasma component of the local interstellar medium were
calculated by solving the axisymmetric MHD equations using

the shock-ﬁtting approach. The solar wind was assumed non-
magnetized. The magnetic ﬁeld of the interstellar medium
was assumed parallel to its velocity vector. The system of
MHD equations in the quasi-linear form was solved by the
iteration method. Each iteration consisted of the two steps. At
the ﬁrst step, the gasdynamic part of the system was solved as-
suming magnetic ﬁeld known from the previous time step. At
the second iteration step, the Maxwell equations were solved
assuming velocities known. At the ﬁrst step of each itera-
tion magnetic ﬁeld was assumed zero. The gasdynamic part
was solved by the time-stabilization method [113] (see Sec-
tion 3). For the known distribution of gasdynamic parameters
the magnetic ﬁeld in the considered case can be determined
analytically as

B = B∞

ρv
ρ∞V∞

These equation follows from the induction equations and

the MHD jump conservation relations [51] for B

v.

The following solar wind and LISM parameters were cho-

It is quite clear from this picture that both the LISM mag-
netic ﬁeld and the charge-exchange processes play an impor-
tant role in the interaction. One can notice that, although a
shock-ﬁtting approach perfectly well works in the forward
part of the interaction, its limitations reveal themselves in
the tail part of the ﬂow. The applicability of the described
approach is also limited to axisymmetric problems.

8.4 Shock-capturing calculations

All mentioned in the previous subsection necessitates the ap-
plication of shock-capturing methods for modeling of the
SW–LISM interaction. In [59] this problem was solved in
the closed region surrounding an ejecting star on the basis of
the ﬂux-splitting method [46]. The choice of parameters was
far from those adopted nowadays for the considered problem.
Although, as a whole, a physically consistent results were ob-
tained, the resolution of discontinuities was rather poor and
some of the obtained data were misinterpreted and disputed
in [13].

In [80] the solution of the axisymmetric problem (the LISM
magnetic ﬁeld strength vector is assumed to be parallel to its
velocity vector) is presented for realistic SW and LISM pa-
rameters. The numerical method applied was developed by
Pogorelov [14] and is the high-resolution second-order of
accuracy version of the Lax–Friedrichs scheme. This me-
thod gives a drastic simpliﬁcation of the numerical algorithm
comparing with the methods based on the exact characteris-
tic splitting of the Jacobian matrices in the MHD equations.

the neutral hydrogen are shown by dotted lines

Simple but very effective numerical boundary conditions at
the far-ﬁeld were suggested (see Section 2), which allowed
one to avoid the inﬂuence of spurious reﬂections from the
subsonic outer boundary. An effective procedure of satisfying
the condition of source-free magnetic ﬁelds (divergence-free
condition) was used, which is related to the approach [83].

The formulation of the problem was given is Section 2.
Following [14], the numerical ﬂux at the radial cell interface

Having the second order of accuracy, the proposed scheme
is much less dissipative than the original Lax–Friedrichs me-
thod and provides incomparably better shock resolution. Cal-
culations were performed in the polar computational region
with Rmin = 24 and Rmax = 1200. The mesh was R

Mathematically, if we choose the initial distribution of pa-
rameters with div B = 0, the Maxwell equations will pre-
serve this value in the steady solution. In fact, for problems
solved numerically the regions of div B
= 0 can be accumu-
lated, especially in the vicinity of discontinuities, see [19].
It is quite clear that the application of the one-dimensional
Riemann problem solvers, implying that the component Bn
of the magnetic ﬁeld vector normal to the boundary is con-
stant, contradicts to the condition
Bndσ = 0 over the whole
computational cell. In [83] an approximate Riemann problem
solver for MHD equations was proposed on the basis of the
modiﬁed system (35) which is conservative only in a steady
state. Using the Lax–Friedrichs-type scheme, we do not need
such modiﬁcation, since we do not solve the Riemann prob-
lem to ﬁnd the ﬂuxes at the cell surfaces. The correction in
our case can be made by adding to the source term of Eq. (2)
the value proportional to div B:

This term acts to annihilate the error accumulated if system
is solved in the conservation-law form (see [19]). It is worth
noting that this approach lies in the framework of Powell’s
procedure and the correction term is not small only in the
regions of comparably large errors in div B. This term, in fact,
is equal by the value and opposite by the sign to the appropriate
terms proportional to div B appearing by differentiating E and
G in Eq. (1). The divergence of magnetic ﬁeld strength vector
can be approximated over the ﬁnite volumes as

l+1/2(Bn)l+1/2,n + R2

div B = [R2
[(Bn)l,n+1/2 sin θn+1/2 + (Bn)l,n−1/2 sin θn−1/2]/Rl sin θnD θ

l−1/2(Bn)l−1/2,n]/R2

l D R +

This simple procedure gives a powerful tool for the real-
ization of the divergence-free condition and necessitates only
a slight modiﬁcation of the existing codes for solving MHD
equations. It seems limited, however, only to steady-state cal-
culations.

Numerical results were obtained for the same ﬂow param-
eters as in the previous subsection and for the three different
values of the Alfv´en number: A = 10, 2, √2. The ﬁrst value
corresponds to the very small magnetic ﬁeld (see Fig. 20) and
can be used for comparison with purely gasdynamic results
in which the Roe-type Riemann problem solver was used to
obtain the steady state solution, see Subsection 3.2. In Fig. 20,
the pressure (below the symmetry axis) and the density loga-
rithm isolines are presented (A = 10). All features of the ﬂow

ﬁeld.

As the magnetic ﬁeld increases, the effective Mach number,
generally speaking, diminishes. The similar effect is produced
by the presence of neutral hydrogen atoms and, if both of these
factors exceed a deﬁnite value, the bow shock can disappear.
In this case system (2) becomes elliptic and other methods
must be applied for its solution. It is worth noting, however,
that the speed of propagation of magnetosonic waves depends
on the direction with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld vector.
That means that the effective Mach number varies along the
bow shock. As will be shown later, this results in a highly
asymmetric shape of the bow shock if magnetic ﬁeld is not
parallel to the velocity vector.

If the magnetic ﬁeld strength at inﬁnity is equal to its
10−6 Gauss, the LISM ﬂow be-
probable upper limit of 3

neglected. This can be seen from the simple estimate. We
can calculate the LISM effective Mach number as M2

∞ = 4 the effective Mach number remains larger than unity
only for A > 1.15. Thus, both effects are of great importance
for the interpretation of data obtained in the space experi-
ment. The performance of the algorithm for the realization
of the magnetic ﬁeld source-free condition can be seen from
Fig. 23. The magnetic ﬁeld lines remain parallel to the stream-
lines. One can see that no magnetic ﬁeld penetrates into the
heliosphere. This result can not be achieved without a special
treatment of the divergence-free condition.

eff = 1/M2

The result of the magnetic ﬁeld inﬂuence on the whole
structure of the ﬂow is not sufﬁciently investigated. It is clear
that the ﬂow pattern for B∞
V∞ is three-dimensional.
MHD modeling of the heliopause shape on the basis of the
Newtonian approximation was performed in [34]. The results

it decreases at the side parts due to the magnetic pressure.
On the other hand, although the magnetic ﬁeld is absent in
the region inside the heliopause, its action is revealed by the
increased value of the total pressure at inﬁnity. This leads to
substantial decrease of the termination shock stand-off dis-
tance in the downstream region. We can see the absence of
the Mach disk structure in the backward direction. This means
that the velocity along the termination shock becomes sub-
sonic. The same occurs if the charge-exchange is taken into
account [11]. The bow shock stand-off distance along the sym-
metry axis becomes smaller than in the absence of magnetic

interaction. The problem is rather complicated even in gasdy-
namic and MHD formulations, since the ﬂow pattern contains
a number of intersecting discontinuities and is substantially
three-dimensional. The study of this and other astrophysical
and industrial problems has recently summoned the extension
of high-resolution numerical methods to magnetohydrody-
namic ﬂows. The peculiarity of the problem considered in
this paper is that a continuum approach is applicable only to
the plasma component of the both ﬂows. Trajectories of neu-
tral particles must be calculated using a direct Monte-Carlo
simulation. Although several authors (see brief discussion in
[110]) argue that the application of a ﬂuid approximation neu-
trals gives results close to those obtained on the basis of the
self-consistent Euler–Boltzmann formulation, there is still a
necessity to realize this possibility and to perform a critical
comparison of numerical data for the same set of deﬁning
parameters.

The inﬂuence of the cosmic rays on the interaction is rather
well known, but their inclusion into available numerical algo-
rithms is at the initial stage.

We examined in this review mainly numerical aspects of
the problem. This work by no means can be considered as
an exhaustive description of physical phenomena which take
place in the interaction region. Discussing the subject, we in-
evitably had our preferences and paid them more attention.
The list of references can be extended by hundreds of pub-
lications on the considered problem, but we hope that even
those mentioned in this review give an opportunity to realize
the main processes deﬁning the problem and approaches to
their numerical modeling.

as in the previously described axisymmetric calculation and
A = 2. In Figs. 24–25 the logarithm density isolines are
shown for the case of the angle between v∞ and B∞ equal
to α = 45◦ in the cross-sections ϕ = 0–180◦ and 90◦–270◦,
respectively. The LISM inﬂuences in this case the shape of
the bow shock as well as the location of the stagnation point
at the heliopause surface in a way consistent with the simpli-
ﬁed study [34]. In addition, the results show the existence of
magnetosheath current layers providing proper rotation of the
magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the velocity vector from 45◦
to 0 or 180◦ at the heliopause surface. The bow shock wave
stand-off distance is larger in the regions with a larger angle
between the magnetic ﬁeld and the shock normal. The contact
surface is substantially contracted by the magnetic pressure
in the xy-plane (Fig. 25) rather than in the symmetry xz-plane
(Fig. 24). As was mentioned earlier, the size of the zone be-
tween the bow shock and the heliopause is very important in
view of the charge-exchange processes in this zone.

9 Conclusions

In this work we presented a review of the application of numer-
ical methods to modeling of the stellar wind interaction with
the interstellar medium. This is only one among various do-
mains of their application to space simulation problems. The
environment of distant stars is not so well investigated as the
solar system. That is a particular reason of an extremely inten-
sive study of the solar wind and the local interstellar medium

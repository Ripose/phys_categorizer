Earthquake source parameters and fault kinematics in the Eastern

California Shear Zone

Abstract

Based on waveform data from a proﬁle of aftershocks following the north-south trace of the June 28,

1992 Landers rupture across the Mojave desert, we construct a new velocity model for the Mojave region

which features a thin, slow crust. Using this model, we obtain source parameters, including depth and

duration, for each of the aftershocks in the proﬁle, and in addition, any signiﬁcant (M > 3.7) Joshua

Tree–Landers aftershock between April, 1992 and October, 1994 for which coherent TERRAscope data

were available. In all, we determine source parameters and stress-drops for 45 signiﬁcant (Mw > 4)

earthquakes associated with the Joshua Tree and Landers sequences, using a waveform grid–search

algorithm. Stress drops for these earthquakes appear to vary systematically with location, with respect

to previous seismic activity, proximity to previous rupture (i.e., with respect to the Landers rupture),

and with tectonic province.

In general, for areas north of the Pinto Mountain fault, stress-drops of

aftershocks located oﬀ the faults involved with the Landers rupture are higher than those located on

the fault, with the exception of aftershocks on the newly recognized Kickapoo (Landers) fault. Stress

drops are moderate south of the Pinto Mountain fault, where there is a history of seismic swarms but

no single through-going fault. In contrast to aftershocks in the eastern Transverse ranges, and related to

the 1992 Big Bear, California, sequence, Landers events show no clear relationship between stress–drop

and depth. Instead, higher stress–drop aftershocks appear to correlate with activity on nascent faults,

or those which experienced relatively small slip during mainshock rupture.

Introduction

2

Stress-drop and style, depth and timing of aftershock activity relative to mainshock rupture plane or

fault trace yields clues about how the regional ‘stress budget’ is settled following a large earthquake.

Aftershock stress-drops vary with source area and tectonic environment [Lindley and Archuleta, 1992],

reﬂecting regional diﬀerences in the source properties of small earthquakes.

The Mw7.3 Landers earthquake of 11:58 GMT, June 28, 1992, was preceded by the April 23, 1992,

Joshua Tree mainshock (Mw6.1) which is now considered a precursory event [Stein et al., 1994] with its

own substantial fore– and aftershock sequence. The Landers event was followed by tens of thousands

of aftershocks [Kanamori et al., 1992; Hauksson et al., 1993; Sieh et al., 1993], many in areas with

no surface rupture [e.g, Big Bear region, see Figure 1]. Stress-drops and source parameters of Joshua

Tree–Landers aftershocks provide information critical to understanding fault kinematics in the Eastern

California Shear Zone (ECSZ), which encompasses the Landers rupture area and may extend beneath

the eastern Transverse ranges [Jones and Hough, 1995].

Because data for the present study comes from a sparse array [three to ﬁve TERRAscope stations],

care must be taken when modeling available data to ensure accuracy in depth and source mechanism

estimation. A standard one-dimensional model such as the Southern California Model may often be

used to satisfactorily approximate broadband waveforms at near-regional distances [see Dreger and

Helmberger, 1991]. However, waveform misﬁt introduced by use of an inappropriately thick crust, for

example, more adversely aﬀects quality and robustness (error) of source solutions obtained from small

datasets. A regional model is thus necessary for this work.

In this paper, we present source parameters, including duration, depth, and stress-drop, obtained

for Landers and Joshua Tree events using a new earth model designed to ﬁt near-regional data with

source– receiver paths in the Mojave. The paper treats events from this large sequence as follows,

moving chronologically from the April, 1992 Joshua Tree ‘pre-shock’, to Landers aftershocks, ﬁrst south

and then north of the Pinto Mountain Fault, including a cluster of events in the Barstow region and

3

triggered quakes on the Garlock fault. Events occuring within the ECSZ are compared with Landers

aftershocks occuring in the Eastern Transverse Ranges and comprising the 1992 Big Bear, California,

sequence. Finally, we correlate aftershock stress-drop with timing and proximity to mainshock rupture.

Data and Observations

Larger fore– and aftershocks from the Joshua Tree and Landers sequences were recorded on scale

by six broadband TERRAsope stations (GSC, ISA, PAS, PFO, SVD and SBC). In this study we use

records from the ﬁrst ﬁve stations [Figure 2], since records from station SBC are low signal-to-noise,

and contaminated by propagation through basin structure. For TERRAscope stations Goldstone (GSC)

and Pinyon Flats (PFO), due north and nearly south of the Landers rupture, we construct proﬁles of

aftershocks from the Landers earthquake. These include earthquakes in areas associated with Landers

surface rupture (north of the Pinto Mountain fault), south of the Pinto Mountain fault, and associated

with the Barstow swarm. These earthquakes form rough proﬁles following the general trend of the

Landers rupture.

Before modeling, the records were processed as follows: instrument gain was removed from the raw

velocity records; they were detrended and integrated once. A butterworth bandpass ﬁlter with corners

at 0.04 and 7 Hz was applied twice. Filtering was minimal so that the broadband nature of the records

might be preserved. In cases where the event was fairly large and close to a particular station, low–gain

records (accelerograms) from TERRAscope were used. They were processed similarly: gain removed,

detrended, twice integrated, and bandpass ﬁltered.

Analysis

The Mojave Model

Studies to date on moderately–sized Southern California earthquakes suggest that a relatively simple,

plane–layered velocity model often explains the observed waveforms satisfactorily. For example, wave-

forms from the June 28, 1991 Sierra Madre earthquake, centered within the TERRAscope array, were

4

well–modeled at several stations by the Standard Southern California model [Hadley and Kanamori,

1977; Dreger and Helmberger, 1991]. Studies of several other events also suggest that this standard

model is appropriate for use in the Southern California region [Jones and Helmberger, 1995; Song and

Helmberger, 1997]. However, this standard model did not work well for Landers aftershocks recorded at

stations in the Mojave Desert.

High–quality aftershock data recorded at local to regional distances gave us the opportunity to de-

velop a path–speciﬁc model for the Mojave region. Aftershocks from the Landers sequence recorded

at TERRAScope stations Goldstone (GSC) and Pinon Flats (PFO) were assembled, and proﬁles of

broadband data constructed from events located and recorded in the Mojave block, as such possessing

source–receiver paths contained entirely within this region [Figure 2]. Records at these distances (35-165

km, see Figure 3) are dominated by crustal arrivals and Moho–reﬂected arrivals, which suggest a crust

thinner (depth to the Moho is 28 km) and slower than the standard Southern California Model [Hadley

and Kanamori, 1978; Dreger and Helmberger, 1991] and lacking the gradient at the base of the crust

(Conrad) which characterizes the widely used Standard Model.

The choice of stations GSC and PFO for this modeling task was natural and fortunate, since Landers

events recorded at these two stations form north–south proﬁles. The locations of stations GSC and PFO

nearly due north and south (respectively) of the aftershocks, however, practically insures that many

events will be P–wave nodal at both stations, since many have northerly strikes (parallel to the Landers

rupture). Conversely, the tangential component is at or near maximum, so it is easily modeled [Figure

3].

In order to construct the model, we ﬁrst make an estimate of the source mechanisms for the proﬁle

events, assuming the standard Southern California model [Table I]. We subsequently reﬁne the original

source and moment estimations for the proﬁle events using the new model; these estimations show

improved waveform ﬁt, and lower error.

The Mojave model[Table II] has a thinner crust (28 km versus 35 km) than the standard California

model, and slower P and S wave crustal velocities. It also lacks the gradient at the base of the crust

(the so–called “Conrad” discontinuity) which characterizes the standard model.

Determination of Source Parameters

Average source parameters and depths for the small and moderately sized earthquakes studied here

are estimated using a direct grid–search method [Zhao and Helmberger, 1994]. This algorithm selects

source parameters which minimize the L1 and L2 norms between observations and synthetic waveforms,

using three component Pnl and whole waveforms to produce a stable solution from a relatively sparse

data set and an imperfect structural model [Jones et al, 1993; Jones and Helmberger, 1995; Zhu and

Helmberger, 1996; Song and Helmerger, 1996]. Note that Pnl is deﬁned as the ﬁrst part of the regional

waveform, from where the record is dominated by P phases (Pn) to where the motion contains pro-

gressively more SV contributions (P L) [Helmberger and Engen, 1980]. The procedure desensitizes the

misﬁt in timing between principal crustal arrivals in the data and synthetic by ﬁtting portions of the

waveforms independently. Source durations for the grid-search are initially estimated from the width

of the direct pulse. Reﬁned durations (see below) are then iteratively fed back into the grid search

6

scheme to recompute source parameters. Given the development of Green’s functions speciﬁc to paths

within the Mojave block, we use a sparse array (three to ﬁve stations) and the data both broadband and

after convolution with a long–period Press-Ewing (“LP3090”: 30 s period, 90 s galvenometer) instru-

ment response. The long–period energy is modeled because the solutions are often more stable than the

broadband solutions, as detailed below, though we seek consistency between broadband and long–period

solutions. Broadband solutions were occasionally used for the smallest events, in cases where energy

was lacking in the long-period bandpass and the broadband solution showed greater consistency between

stations.

Estimation of Source Depths.

We determine source depths directly from the surface reﬂected phases SmS or sSmS, and by cycling

through depth–dependent Green’s functions (2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17 km) during the grid-search procedure

itself. To speed the process we employ a catalog of Green’s functions appropriate to the Mojave model,

which are computed at 5 km distance intervals from 35 km to 400 km, and assuming source depths

listed above. In general, the mechanisms and depths obtained in this study are consistent with those

obtained by other workers. In some cases, however, the depths we obtain are not as shallow as those

obtained by others [Thio, 1996, by surface wave inversion; Hauksson, 1993, via inversion of short–period

network data]. As an example, we show modeling for the August 5, 1992, 22:22 GMT Landers aftershock

(Figure 4). Fits for all three components (including the radial) are shown. Error space for the depth

determination (Figure 5) shows a clear minimum at between 5 and 8 km for this event, though others

place the depth of this event at less than 5 km [Hauksson, 1993]. Pnl to surface–wave amplitude ratios

on the vertical and radial components of motion suggest a depth of about 5 km, while ratios of body

wave to Love wave amplitudes suggest a depth of 8 km or greater. Indeed, separation between SmS and

sSmS phases on the tangential components at stations PFO (epicentral distance 155 km), ISA (160 km)

and PAS suggest a depth arguably deeper than 8 km.

Within the error imposed by the depth gridding on our solution space (every 2-3 km), we believe that

our depths, obtained from a grid–search routine which is tantamount to direct waveform modeling, are

7

(1)

(2)

reliable. There is substantial diﬀerence in the separation between SmS and sSmS phases for events at

source–depths of, say, 2 and 5 km. Our estimates suggest that all of the M > 3.7 events we studied had

depths of 5 km or greater; and average depth is about 8 km.

Source Duration and relative Stress-Drop

Source durations are obtained by methods ranging from direct measurement of source pulse [e.g., Smith

and Priestly, 1993; Hardebeck and Haukssen, 1997], to determination of corner frequency [e.g., Hough

and Dreger, 1995]. In this study, average source durations are determined from a simple comparison

of energies [see also Jones and Helmberger, 1996; Zhao and Helmberger, 1996; Song and Helmberger,

1997].

In this procedure, we equalize energy content across diﬀerent frequency bands between data

and synthetics. First, a short-period Wood-Anderson instrument response (WASP) and a long–period

instrument response (LP3090) are applied to data and synthetics to compute short– and long–period

energy, respectively. The Pnl waves (in velocity) from each station are then compared with synthetic

Pnl waveforms (velocity):

where

V(sp) is the observed (or synthetic) Pnl wave, in velocity, convolved with a short-period Wood–Anderson

response, while V(lp) is the observed (or synthetic) Pnl wave, in velocity, convolved with an LP3090

instrument response. The time-function for the synthetic waveform is adjusted until the ratio of energies

is unity (symmetric trapezoidal time functions are assumed). An average for the radial and vertical

components is found at each station, and the resulting values for each reporting station are then averaged.

The procedure yields a conservative estimate of source–time duration and thus stress-drop, and is

limited to source triangles no shorter than 0.20 s in duration. This limitation is imposed by the com-

putational technique used, and to a lesser extent, by the frequency content available in the synthetic

Green’s functions. Other researchers using this method found good correlation between source dura-

tions determined via comparison of energies and those determined by measuring the width of the direct

pulse at local stations [ Song and Helmberger, 1997], except for a (constant) oﬀset. The oﬀset may be

explained by the fact that the synthetics used in the energy method do not contain scattering [Song and

Helmberger, 1997]. Note that source durations obtained by energy comparison are systematically smaller

than those obtained via direct measurement. The energy method thus provides a reliable estimate of

‘relative’ source duration between events.

Assuming minimal attenuation, the width of the observed P or S pulse is proportional to the source

dimension, and thus source duration. The actual pulse-width, as observed, may depend on factors as

diverse as crustal attenuation, rupture mode, length and velocity, and source complexity. On average,

however, it is acceptable to assume a linear relationship between pulse–width and source dimension.

Indeed, Cohn et al. [1982], assuming a circular fault [Brune, 1970], obtained the relation

where τ is the source duration in seconds, a is the radius in km, and β is the shear velocity local to the

source region. Solving for a in terms of τ , assuming a shear velocity of 3.5 km/s, and substituting the

result into the expression for stress–drop on a circular fault [Eschelby, 1957]

we obtain (in bars, given 1 bar = 106 dyne-cm2)

τ =

2.62a

△σ =

An estimate of the error inherent in the computation of relative stress-drop is found as follows. Assuming

that the error in Mo and τ are to ﬁrst order independent, we can write the error as the vector sum of

Small events with shorter time functions had relatively greater error associated with the determination

of source duration, and often greater error associated with the determination of moment (due to poor

signal to noise). For the Joshua Tree sequence, for example, we obtain errors ranging from 67%, for

an event with 58% error in the moment estimation and Mb4.3, to 32%, for an event with 29% error in

moment estimation, and Mb4.5. Larger events are predictably associated with smaller error. The July

11, 1992, Mb5.1 Garlock fault event had an uncertainty in moment estimation of 24%, and an error in

stress-drop estimation of about 20%.

We use relative stress-drop along with source parameters in the following discussion to explore the

relation between source type, depth, location and relative energy release in the eastern California shear

zone.

Results and Discussion

Large aftershocks occurring up to two-and-a-half Coulomb stress changes caused by four M > 5 earth-

quakes preceding the Landers mainshock (i.e., the 1975 ML5.2 Galway Lake, 1979 ML5.2 Homestead

Valley, ML6 North Palm Springs and ML6.1 Joshua Tree earthquakes) progressively increased stresses

at the site of the future Landers epicenter [King et al, 1994]. In turn, changes in static stresses caused by

10

the Landers event triggered the Big Bear event within hours of the Landers mainshock, and earthquakes

as far away as the western Garlock fault and Yucca Mountain in the ensuing months [Hill et al., 1993,

Gomberg and Bodin, 1994].

As discussed below, Joshua Tree sequence seismicity moved northwards in the months following the

Joshua tree mainshock, culminating in clusters of aftershocks just north of the Pinto Mountain fault

and within the Landers epicentral area in early June of 1992. Hours before the Landers mainshock,

a cluster formed at what later became the Landers epicenter [Hauksson et al., 1993]. The Landers

earthquake involved rupture on ﬁve separate faults north of the Pinto Mountain fault, with a small

amount of displacement south of the Pinto Mountain fault on the Eureka Peak fault (Figure 6). The

latter rupture may not have occurred entirely during the mainshock, but may have been associated with

a M 5.7 aftershock occurring minutes after the mainshock [Hough et al., 1993].

We divide our discussion of the Landers sequence into four portions: aftershocks south of the Pinto

Mountain fault, including the Joshua Tree ’preshock’ sequence, and associated with minimal displace-

ment; aftershocks north of the Pinto Mountain fault, associated with the Landers rupture, aftershocks

north and east of the mapped Landers rupture, in the Barstow and Calico–Pisgah fault clusters, respec-

tively; and aftershocks or triggered events along the Garlock fault.

Joshua Tree Sequence

The Joshua Tree sequence began on April 23, 1992 at 02:25 GMT with a Mw = 4.3 foreshock. This

event occurred at a location just south of the Pinto Mountain fault (-116.32 W, 33.94 N), and north of

the Coachella Valley segment of the San Andreas fault, within the Little San Bernardino Mountains, in a

region which has historically seen frequent earthquake swarms. It was followed by a number of additional

smaller foreshocks, then within two-and-a half hours by the nearly co-located Mw = 6.1 Joshua Tree

mainshock (Mori, 1994). The Joshua Tree mainshock had no observed surface rupture, though a 10-to 12

km south-to-north subsurface fault–plane, striking roughly N 20oW , was inferred from the distribution

of early aftershocks [Wald, personal comm., 1992; Hauksson et al., 1993; Hough and Dreger, 1994].

11

The mainshock was followed by a sustained and powerful aftershock series which comprised at least

28 aftershocks of M > 3.7, 10 of which were M 4.0 − M 4.7. Joshua Tree aftershocks partially overlap

those from the later Landers earthquake, with a cluster of aftershocks, including one event above M 4,

developing north of the Pinto Mountain fault and slightly east of the Landers mainshock location in

early June (e.g., Figure 7a, aftershock number 9). M > 3.9 aftershocks form two separate clusters south

of the Pinto Mountain fault which are ﬁlled in by later aftershocks from the Landers earthquake (Figure

7b). The Joshua Tree series is dominated by moderate to deep (source depth 8–14 km) strike–slip and

oblique–slip events. Stress-drops for these earthquakes are on the order of 10 − 100 bars, with an average

of 30 bars.

Events of the Joshua Tree sequence are now viewed as preshocks to the later Landers mainshock. While

the Landers mainshock apparently either recharged or “reactivated” aftershock activity in the Joshua

Tree region [Hauksson, 1994], M > 3.8 aftershocks from the Joshua Tree and later Landers events can

be viewed as distinct populations. Spatially, they occupy distinct but ajoining volumes rather than

overlapping completely (Figures 7b, 8). Their mechanisms are similar, presumably strike–slip on north

to northwest–striking planes, though Joshua Tree aftershocks are on average deeper [Tables III, IV].

The presence of several M > 4 Landers aftershocks in the Joshua Tree epicentral region supports post–

Landers reactivation of stresses immediately local to the Joshua Tree epicentral area. These M > 4

events are not numerous, however, are low in stress–drop relative to other aftershocks south of the Pinto

Mountain fault, and are generally not vertical strike–slip.

Landers events south of the Pinto Mountain Fault

Following the Landers mainshock, large (M > 4.5) aftershocks were more common south of the Pinto

mountain fault than north (Figures 8, 9, 12). Almost 76% of the total aftershock energy released post–

Landers was released south of the mainshock epicenter, with about 40% of the energy release distributed

between the Pinto Mountain fault and the Joshua Tree epicenter [Ma, 1993].

A tight and dense cluster of early aftershocks formed near the epicentral locations of the events on

12

the Eureka Peak and Burnt Mountain faults, as observed in the immediate aftermath and epicentral

location of the (northern) Landers mainshock (Figure 8). Unlike the Landers epicentral area, however,

large (M ≥ 4) aftershocks continued in this southern region for many months.

Aftershocks extend roughly 40 km south of the mainshock epicenter, forming a NW–SE trending

swath 5-15 km in width [Hauksson et al., 1993]. We present source parameters, depths, durations and

relative stress-drops for 14 Mw ≥ 3.7 aftershocks occurring south of the Pinto Mountain fault, including

an Mw4.5 event on August 21, 1993 (Figure 9, Table IV, event number 13) and two events in August of

1994 (Figure 9, Table IV, events 14–15). Events studied suggest a fairly heterogeneous sequence, though

oblique strike–slip events are most numerous. These oblique events are consistent in strike direction;

all strike NW, presumably in the same direction as the Joshua Tree mainshock (N 20oW ) and with

strike–slip events associated with the Joshua Tree sequence (Figure 7ab).

Like those estimated for Joshua Tree aftershocks, relative stress-drops for Landers aftershocks south

of the Pinto Mountain fault are on the order of 10 − 100 bars; with an average of about 67 bars for

aftershocks within the ﬁrst year of the mainshock, and an average of 60 bars for aftershocks through

1994. Lowest stress–drop events are associated with either the epicentral region of the southern rupture

(Figure 7b), or the area active during earlier Joshua Tree sequence (including the Joshua Tree mainshock)

located south of the southern rupture. High stress–drop earthquakes (events 2, 9, 10) lie west and nearly

on the periphery of the low stress–drop cluster associated with Eureka Peak rupture (i.e., events 3, 4,

5, 8, 12) as seen in Figure 9. Event 14 (on the periphery of former Joshua Tree seismicity) is unusually

low stress-drop, but occurred after much of the sequence had exhausted itself: this late Mw3.7 event

occurred in August of 1994, at a depth of 8 km. On average, Landers events are higher stress-drop than

Joshua Tree events [Tables III, IV, Figure 10], again supporting the notion that the Landers mainshock

may have recharged this historically active region.

In map view ’Southern Landers’ events do not deﬁne any one fault plane; rather they re-rupture

areas associated with the Joshua Tree sequence, and ﬁll in unaﬀected regions north towards the Pinto

Mountain fault. The history of seismic activity in the region, the present heterogeneity of faulting and

13

the lack of any one well-deﬁned fault plane suggest that displacement south of the Pinto mountain fault

may be accommodated gradually (i.e., in small increments) across a number of small subsurface faults.

The gap in large aftershocks across the Pinto Mountain fault (Figure 9) suggests that Landers rupture

may not continue across the fault, and that displacement south of the Pinto Mountain fault may be

primarily associated with aftershock activity.

Landers events occurring North of the Pinto Mountain Fault

Rupture along the ﬁve faults active in the Landers mainshock (from south to north, the Johnson Valley

fault, the Kickapoo (Landers) fault, the Homestead Valley fault, the Emerson fault and the Camp Rock

fault) extended roughly 60 km N-NW across the Mojave desert north of the Pinto Mountain fault (Figure

6). Large (M > 3.9) aftershocks along the trend of the Landers rupture are common in three general

areas: close to the mainshock epicenter (early aftershocks, within the ﬁrst 24-48 hours), at fault ends,

including the termination of the Johnson Valley fault and the very active Kickapoo (Landers) fault,

and the northern extent of rupture, at the northern terminus of the Camp Rock fault (Figures 6, 12).

Landers aftershocks north of the Pinto Mountain fault (discounting events on the Garlock) are higher

stress-drop than southern Landers aftershocks, with on average of 95 bars for events occurring in the

ﬁrst year after the mainshock [Figure 10, Table V].

Mainshock Epicentral Area (Johnson Valley Fault). According to Wald and Heaton [1994], the Landers

mainshock initiated on the Johnson Valley fault (JVF) at depth, and the ﬁrst seconds of rupture involved

deep slip. Rupture then continued shallowly on the JVF for the subsequent 4 seconds. The region

immediately local to the Landers epicenter, along the previously recognized and active Johnson Valley

fault, saw many M > 4 aftershocks within the ﬁrst 24 hours of the mainshock, [Hauksson et al., 1993].

However, we were not able to obtain TERRAscope data for these early events. We examined two later

events, one nearly co–located with the mainshock (Figure 12, event 10), and one slightly northeast of the

same, a M 4.7 event which occurred in June of 1994 (Figure 12, event 19). Both events are oblique–slip,

of moderate to shallow source depth, and are low stress-drop (9 and 15 bars, respectively, see Figures

14

12 and 13), suggesting that stresses local to the mainshock epicentral area were fairly low in the months

and hours following the Landers earthquake. Indeed, according to Abercrombie and Mori [1994], the

mainshock itself began with a shallow, low stress-drop preshock composed of two M ∼ 4 − 5 subevents

(stress–drops for both ∼ 12 bars), which triggered or grew into the M 7.3 Landers mainshock.

Kickapoo (Landers) Fault. There were an unusual number of Mw > 3.9 aftershocks along the short

segment of the newly recognized Kickapoo (Landers) fault. This is a previously unmapped, 5 km long

N-S trending fault strand running from the northern leg of the Johnson Valley fault northwards to the

southernmost end of the Homestead Valley fault. Rupture during the 1992 Landers event propagated

from the Johnson Valley fault to the Homestead Valley fault along the Kickapoo fault and secondary

fault traces just east of the Kickapoo [Sowers et al., 1994]. We studied four (out of six) M > 3.9

aftershocks occurring along or near the Kickapoo fault which were recorded on the TERRAscope array

[Figure 12].

The earliest event is a normal-faulting event occurring near the southern end of the zone comprised

of the Kickapoo and its secondary faults (Figure 12, Table V, event 1). It is of moderate stress–drop

(84 bars) and average depth for this region. It was followed by two strike–slip to oblique–slip events

just north along the Kickapoo (Figure 12, Table V, events 3 and 9) The ﬁrst of these is the largest

aftershock to occur within the Landers rupture region, at Mw = 5.2, and also has the highest stress-drop

(about 515 ± 176 bars, Table A second (Mw3.9) colocated right-lateral strike-slip aftershock occurred

two weeks later (event 9) at a depth of about 6 km. This event is substantially smaller, has a much

lower stress-drop (30 bars), and may represent re-rupturing of a previously ruptured fault-patch. A

later Mw4.3 event occurred near the southern end of the Homestead Valley fault approximately near

the termination of the Kickapoo fault (Figure 12, event 15). This aftershock is of similar depth (7 km),

has an oblique–slip source mechanism, and a stress-drop of about 86 bars. It occurred within a region

mapped and described by Spotila and Sieh [1995], and exhibiting both strike–slip and thrust faulting.

This region was associated with a slip-gap during the Landers rupture, and showed some vertical oﬀset

but virtually no strike-slip motion.

15

The presence of the latter three events lends support to the dominantly right-lateral oﬀset “through-

going” model suggested by Sowers et al. [1994] for the Kickapoo fault. However, the mechanism of the

earliest large Kickapoo aftershock (event 1) suggests extension, which lends credence to the less favored

“step-over model” suggested by Sowers et al.

[1994]. Clearly the tectonics of the Kickapoo fault is

more complicated than either of these simple schemes; perhaps some combination of the two models,

might explain the complex seismicity we observe here. The presence of so many heterogeneous and high

stress–drop aftershocks along this small segment of fault also lends credence to the suggestion made by

Spotila and Sieh [1995], that the connection between the Johnson Valley and Homestead Valley faults

is incomplete, and that the Kickapoo fault is still very immature.

Emerson and Camp Rock Faults. Large on–fault aftershocks appear to be much less common north

of the Kickapoo Fault. Most M > 3.9 aftershock activity appears to be concentrated near the end of

rupture on the Camp Rock fault. Relative stress–drops on these faults are low to moderate, ranging

from 38 to 86 bars for the events we studied [Table IV].

Oﬀ–Fault Aftershock Activity

In addition, there are clusters of large aftershocks oﬀ-fault (i.e., unrelated to any primary rupture

during the Landers mainshock). These occurred east of the Landers rupture, near the Pisgah/Calico

faults (Figures 12 and 15) and north of the terminus of Landers rupture on the Camp Rock fault, in the

Barstow region.

Aftershocks on Pisgah–Calico Faults. Aftershocks near the Calico fault [Figure 11] form two east-west

alignments perpendicular to the trend of the Landers rupture, roughly at the latitudes of the Emerson

and Camp Rock faults [Figure 6]. Stress–drops for two M > 4 events [Figure 11, events 16, 20] are

moderate to high; the latter event (20) occurred more than two years after the Landers mainshock but

shows similar fault motion and depth as the earlier event (16) occurring in August, 1992. In addition,

there is a spatially and temporally tight cluster of aftershocks just east of the Pisgah fault, several of

which are larger than M 4. Two of these occurred within an hour of each other, and were nearly colocated

16

(events 5 and 6); the second event having a lower relative stress drop (25 bars) than the ﬁrst (71 bars).

Aftershocks on the Pisgah and Calico faults may be related to oﬀ–fault strain caused by changes in

strike along the Landers rupture [Sieh et al., 1993]. High stress–drops in both regions might suggest

high applied shear stresses along north to northwest–striking planes.

The Barstow Sequence. The Barstow cluster was associated with no surface rupture, and occurred

approximately 30 to 40 km north of the aftershocks associated with northernmost Landers rupture on the

Camp Rock fault. It began approximately 6 hours after the Landers mainshock, and comprised at least

12 aftershocks above M 4. The largest aftershock, at Mw = 4.4, occurred on August 5, 1992, at 22:22

GMT, within a tight cluster of larger aftershocks towards the southern end of the trend [Figure 13]. The

Barstow sequence is fairly narrow in width compared with aftershocks along the Landers rupture; the

ratio of length (about 20 km) to width (2–3 km) has been cited as evidence that the Barstow sequence

may have occurred on a single fault, unlike Landers [Hauksson et al., 1993]. However, closer examination

of the larger aftershocks in the sequence shows a distinct jog in the trend of the aftershocks, with a tight

cluster to the southeast (e.g., aftershocks 11, 14, at depths of 8 and 7 km, respectively) which could

arguably have occurred on a single fault. There is an abrupt step-over, with events farther to the west

(events 4, 11) along a rough trend striking NW–SE. Stress–drops for these earthquakes range from 16−80

bars, with an average of about 50 bars. Our depth estimations do not show the shallowing reported by

Hauksson et al.,[1993], and shallowest events are at a depth of 5 km.

Aftershocks or ’Triggered Events’ on the Garlock fault?

The Garlock fault has long been recognized as an important tectonic feature in Southern California.

Though it has not produced any large earthquakes within the period of historical record, numerous

scarps and left-laterally oﬀset Holocene features suggest that the fault is active and has produced large

earthquakes. As recent levels of seismic activity on this fault are low in comparison to those inferred

from Holocene displacements, the Garlock fault may represent a seismic gap [Astiz and Allen, 1983].

Until the moderately sized earthquakes in July of 1992 [Figure 13, event 8] and again in October, 1994,

17

[Figure 13, event 21] no such earthquakes were known to have occurred on the Garlock fault, though

there were several historical events for which a Garlock fault source was possible [McGill and Sieh, 1991].

The July 1992 event was the larger of the two recent events, at Mw = 5.3. This was the largest

earthquake associated with the Garlock fault since the June 10, 1988, ML = 5.4 earthquake that occurred

several km north of the Garlock, about 20 km east of its intersection with the San Andreas fault [McGill

and Sieh, 1991]. Prior to the 1988 event, the most recent earthquakes local to the Garlock fault were two

historical events occurring in 1916: a M 5.5 event 45 km north of the eastern end of fault, in the Quail

mountains [Toppozada et al., 1978] and a M 5.2 quake at the western end of the fault, for which the San

Andreas may be responsible. The July 11, 1992, Mw5.3 Garlock earthquake was clearly related to and

possibly triggered by the sudden changes in the regional stress ﬁeld caused by Landers. The 1992 event

and the October 19, 1994, Mw4.0 earthquake lie on either side of the midpoint of the Garlock (near the

city of Rand), which marks a change in strike, seismic and aseismic behavior, and geology [Astiz and

Allen, 1983]. The two events lie on either side of an en-echelon fault step-over near Rand and Koehn

lake, which McGill and Sieh [1991] argue divides the fault into a western and an eastern segment.

While the western segment of the Garlock Fault has manifested continuous low level seismicity and

demonstrable creep during the last several decades, the eastern segment has had only a few small

earthquakes, and no observed creep [Astiz and Allen, 1983]. The Mw5.3 1992 event, which took place

within two weeks of the Landers mainshock, occurred on the western segment very near the en echelon

step–over, at a depth of 11 km [Figure 13, Table V, event 8]. This event was moderate in size, with

a moment of Mo = 9.44 ± 2.29 × 1023 (from our long–period solution), but extremely short in source

duration, which yields an unusually high stress-drop of about 1044 ± 253 bars. Broadband and long–

period waveform ﬁts for the July 11, 1992, Garlock event are shown on Figures 14a and 14b, respectively.

The broadband modeling yields a lower moment estimation, thus a slightly lower stress-drop of 840 ± 316

bars. Error associated with moment determination is greater for the broadband records, which translates

into higher error in the stress-drop estimation.

The Mw4.0 1994 event occurred on the eastern segment of the Garlock, also near the en-echelon

18

stepover, and had a stronger thrust component to its motion [Figure 13, event 21], and a depth of about

8 km. The stress–drop is lower than that obtained for the earlier event, but nonetheless high: 192 ± 90

bars for the long–period solution. The presence of these argueably triggered, rare high stress–drop events

on a seismically quiescent fault suggests that small patches of the fault may rupture energetically, in the

ﬁrst case at fairly great depth within the crust. This further suggests that the Garlock may be storing

strain, especially near the step-over which marks a transition from creeping to locked behaviour.

Summary

Since duration and moment are routinely computed for each event we study, we infer stress-drops for

these events, assuming a circular fault. Stress–drops appear to vary systematically with location, with

respect to previous seismicity or rupture, and in the case of events in the Transverse ranges only, with

respect to depth [Figure 15]. Our event sample size is small in number for any given region, yet the

events studied here are of moderate size (on average M ∼ 4.2) thus associated with more energy release

than smaller (and more numerous) events.

We have observed the following for events within the ECSZ:

• Joshua Tree events occurred in a historically active region, and while the sequence was relatively

sustained given the mainshock size, average stress-drops are relatively low (30 bars) compared to

aftershocks from the Landers sequence both north and south of the Pinto Mountain fault [Figure

10].

• Almost 76% of total aftershock energy post-Landers was released south of the mainshock epicenter

in the ‘Southern Landers’ area, yet stress-drops for these events are about 50% lower, on average,

than stress-drops for events north of the Pinto Mountain fault (i.e., 67 bars for Southern Landers,

and 95 bars for on-fault and oﬀ-fault activity North of the Pinto Mountain Fault, omitting Garlock

events; see Figure 10).

• Regions active during the Joshua Tree sequence form a stress-drop low during the ‘Southern Lan-

19

ders’ sequence, and M > 4 events there were not numerous. This suggests that while the Landers

mainshock may have ’recharged’ aftershock activity in the Joshua Tree region [Hauksson, 1994],

moment-release and stress-drop in the region remained low.

• Heterogeneous and high stress-drop aftershocks occurred along the newly recognized Landers-

Kickapoo fault, associated with smaller surﬁcial slip on the Landers fault relative to Johnson

Valley fault (JVF) and Homestead valley faults (HVF) and lack of through-going dextral rupture

across the JVF/HVF stepover. High stress-drop events in this area may be related to the presence

of the immature Landers fault and an incomplete connection between the Johnson Valley and

Homstead Valley fault systems.

• High stress-drops in the Pisgah-Calico region might suggest high applied shear-stresses on North-

South planes, while relative stress-drops in historically active Barstow were appreciably lower,

much like aftershocks in the Joshua Tree region.

• In the immediate aftermath of the Landers event, a large, rare, high-stress-drop event ocurred on

the historically quiescent Garlock fault. Two years later a second event occurred near the stepover

from the creeping western segment to the ’locked’ eastern strand of the fault. The presence of

these two events on a historically aseismic fault suggests that small patches of a quiescent fault

may rupture very energetically, and also that the Garlock may be storing strain, especially at the

stepover which marks a transition from creeping to locked behavior.

• In contrast to aftershocks from the Big Bear sequence, Landers aftershocks are in general shallower

[Jones and Helmberger, 1996]. While Landers and Big Bear events are all moderately high stress–

drop (on average, 70 bars for the Landers events, 100 bars for Big Bear, see Figure 15), events

occurring in the eastern Transverse ranges are generally higher stress-drop, and show a strong

correlation between high stress-drop and greater event depth. Like events in the Transverse ranges,

however, high stress drops for Landers events appear to correlate with activity on immature or

low-slip faults.

Conclusions

20

The Landers mainshock and related events altered the tectonic landscape and stress budget of Southern

California in ways not yet fully assessed. The Landers earthquake itself involved surface rupture and

displacement on six separate faults, including rupture south of the Pinto Mountain fault on the Eureka

Peak fault. Aftershocks and triggered events occurred as far away as Mammoth Lakes, California, and

Little Skull Mountain, Nevada [Hill et al., 1993], and included the complex M 6.5 Big Bear mainshock,

and several unusual earthquakes on the Garlock fault.

For the Landers sequence, stress–drops of events located at some distance from the Landers rupture are

higher than those located on the faults involved in the mainshock, with the exception of aftershocks on

the juvenile Kickapoo (Landers) fault. Rupture on this fault segment was complicated, and displacement

may have been accommodated across a number of subsidiary or discontinuous fault traces. The fact that

the Kickapoo fault had some of the lowest measured surface displacements during the Landers mainshock

lends credence to this idea.

Aftershock stress drop patterns often show a low associated with the mainshock fault–plane. We

observe an analoguous phenomenon in the low stress-drops recorded for previously active regions of the

strike-slip system comprising Southern and Northern Landers. Work by Smith and Priestly [1993] on

the 1984 Round Valley, California, earthquake showed an aftershock stress-drop minimum on the fault-

plane, suggesting nearly complete stress-release in the ruptured area. Consistent with their work, and

with theories of fault rupture and asperity [Madariaga, 1973], is our observation that stress drops are

relatively higher oﬀ-fault and around the edges of the rupture trace.

High stress-drops have been associated with long earthquake recurrence times [Kanamori and Allen,

1986; Scholz et al., 1986], which may in turn be related to low slip rates on locked, discontinuous, or

youthful faults. In the aftermath of the Landers quake, an unusual, deep, high stress-drop event was

triggered on the Garlock fault, which has not experienced any large earthquakes within the period of

historical record, though scarps and oﬀset features suggest it has produced large quakes in the past.

21

Here again is an example of a quiescent fault producing high stress–drop events.

Aftershocks South of the Pinto Mountain fault occurred in a region associated with high rates of post–

seismic deformation, like those in the Barstow region [Shen et al, 1993]. Lower stress–drop aftershocks

seem to occur in regions which previously experienced the most local moment release; i.e., near the

Eureka Peak fault, and near the Joshua Tree mainshock epicenter.

Figure 2: Source–receiver paths for the proﬁles used in source modeling, and in the construction and

testing of the Mojave Model. Stations GSC, PFO and SVD were used primarily in the estimation of

source mechanisms for Landers and Joshua Tree events. Stations ISA and PAS were included as needed,

to create a robust solution in cases where the solution appeared unstable. Source–event paths for stations

GSC and PFO were used in the development of the Mojave model (Table I).

at station GSC. This proﬁle ranges north to south, with source–receiver distances ranging from 40 to

160 km and source depths between 8 and 11 km, roughly average for this sequence. Source mechanisms

used in the modeling are computed using the methods discussed in text. Records are modeled and

shown broadband; observed displacement records are shown in bold line above synthetics. Synthetics

are generated using the Mojave model (this paper, Table I) and the frequency–wavenumber method.

Figure 4: Broadband modeling for the August 5, 1992 22:22 (Barstow) aftershock. Source depth was

estimated at between 5 and 8 km by cycling through synthetics appropriate to source depths from 2

to 17 km, and ﬁnding a minimum error solution. Event duration was estimated ﬁrst by measuring the

direct pulse, then by the energy method described in this paper. Synthetics are generated using the F-K

method and the Mojave model. This plot shows waveform ﬁts assuming a depth of 8 km; the next plot

shows the depth of 8 km.

indicate comparatively “deep” events (12 to 17 km); ﬁlled crosses indicate “intermediate” depth events

(8 to 11 km); and ﬁlled hexagons indicate “shallow” events (2 to 7 km). Lines of constant stress drop are

plotted diagonally across the ﬁgure; from top to bottom: 100, 10, and 1 bar(s). The ﬁrst panel shows

Landers events north the of Pinto Mountain fault, the second shows events south of the Pinto Mountain

fault and the third shows Joshua Tree events.

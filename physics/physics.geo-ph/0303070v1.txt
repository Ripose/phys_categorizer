Abstract.

Using the simple ETAS branching model of seismicity,
which assumes that each earthquake can trigger other earth-
quakes, we quantify the role played by the cascade of trig-
gered seismicity in controlling the rate of aftershock decay
as well as in the overall level of seismicity in the presence of
a constant external seismicity source. We show that, in this
model, the proportion of triggered seismicity is equal to the
proportion of secondary plus later-generation aftershocks,
and is given by the average number of triggered events per
earthquake. Based on these results and the observation that
a large fraction of seismicity are triggered earthquakes, we
conclude that similarly a large fraction of aftershocks oc-
curring a few hours or days after a mainshock are triggered
indirectly by the mainshock.

1. Introduction

There is a growing awareness and an intense research ac-
tivity based on the fact that a signiﬁcant fraction of earth-
quakes are events triggered (in part) by preceding events.
In addition, a signiﬁcant part of triggered events may be
indirectly triggered by a previous event through a cascade
process. What is then the relative role of earthquake interac-
tions and triggering compared with the underlying tectonic
driving forces? Is there a way to distinguish triggered earth-
quakes from untriggered ones or to estimate the proportion
of directly or indirectly triggered earthquakes? Here, we
use the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model
to oﬀer a quantiﬁcation of earthquake interactions. This
model is based on the two best established empirical laws of
seismicity, the Gutenberg-Richter and the Omori law. The
ETAS model has been used in many studies to describe or
predict the spatio-temporal distribution of seismicity and
reproduces many properties of real seismicity (see [Ogata,
1999] and [Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002a] for reviews).
The ETAS model assumes that the seismicity results from
the sum of an external constant loading and from earth-
quakes triggered by these sources in direct lineage or through
a cascade of generations. From this deﬁnition (see below),
it is clear that the ETAS model is not only a model of af-
tershock sequences, as the acronym ETAS would make one
to believe, but is fundamentally a description of seismic-
ity combining a model of driving/forcing (tectonic loading)

with a model of triggered interacting seismicity. We use this
model to quantify (a) the fraction of triggered events rela-
tive to the sources and (b) the fraction of indirectly triggered
events with respect to the total triggered seismicity.

Question (a) has been previously visited in order to pro-
vide unambiguous deﬁnitions of aftershocks and to declus-
ter seismic catalogs. Several alternative algorithms for the
deﬁnition of aftershocks have been proposed [see Molchan
and Dmitrieva, 1992 for a review]. Gardner and Knopoﬀ
[1974] proposed to detect aftershocks according to a win-
dowing method. Applied to the Southern California cata-
log, they found that 2/3 of the events in the catalog are af-
tershocks. Reasenberg [1985] analyzed the central California
catalog over the period 1969-1982, and identiﬁed aftershocks
from the constraint of obtaining a declustered catalog with a
constant seismic rate. In this way, he found that 48% of the
events belong to a seismic cluster. Davis and Frohlich [1991]
used the ISC catalog and, out of 47500 earthquakes, found
that 30% belong to a cluster, of which 76% are aftershocks
and 24% are foreshocks. Kagan [1991] estimated the ratio of
dependent events in various catalogs (California and world-
wide) using an inversion by the maximum likelihood method
of a simple cascade model of aftershock seismicity. The pro-
portion of dependent earthquakes of the ﬁrst generation that
he estimated displays huge ﬂuctuations from 0.1% for deep
events to 90%, but is often close to 20%. Kagan [1991] also
estimated the theoretical ratio of dependent events for the
same catalogs, which is a function of the parameters of the
cascade model. He found that about 60% of the earthquakes
are dependent events. Knopoﬀ [2000] revisited a windowing
method applied to the Southern California catalog over the
period 1944-1990, for magnitudes M ≥ 4. He found again
that clustered events constitute about 2/3 of the whole cat-
alog.

With respect to question (b), the existence of strong
spatio-temporal clustering of aftershocks shows that a non-
negligible proportion of aftershocks may be triggered indi-
rectly by the mainshock, that is, they may be aftershocks
of aftershocks triggered by the mainshock [Felzer et al.,
2003]. For instance in Southern California, the M = 6.5
Big-Bear earthquake occurred a few hours following the Lan-
ders M = 7.3 event and has clearly triggered its own after-
shock sequence. While each aftershock induces a negligible
stress change by comparison to the mainshock, all after-
shocks when taken together can signiﬁcantly alter the stress
ﬁeld induced by the mainshock, so that most aftershocks at
large times after the mainshock are triggered by previous
aftershocks of the mainshock. Correig et al.
[1997] ana-
lyzed the aftershock sequence of a M = 5.2 mainshock in
the eastern Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain.
They separated aftershocks as being either leading after-
shocks or cascades, the latter being deﬁned as clusters of

2

aftershocks following these leading aftershocks. They found
that leading aftershocks represent only 10% of the after-
shock sequences. If we identify leading aftershocks with di-
rect aftershocks of the mainshock, a value of 10% for the
proportion of direct aftershocks gives an estimate of the to-
tal fraction of indirect aftershocks equal to 90%. Felzer et
al. [2002] estimated the rate of indirect aftershocks, from a
comparison of the Landers aftershock sequence with numer-
ical simulations of a simple model of aftershock sequence.
They found that about 85% of the aftershocks of the Lan-
ders event were indirect aftershocks. This implies that the
1999 MW = 7.1 Hector Mine earthquake was triggered, not
by the 1992 MW = 7.3 Landers earthquake itself [Felzer et
al., 2002], but more likely by some of its direct and indirect
aftershocks. Felzer et al. [2003] further analyzed the tem-
poral evolution of the proportion of secondary aftershocks
and found that most aftershocks after one week following
a mainshock are secondary aftershocks. This estimation is
based on an inversion of the ETAS parameters and on a ﬁt
of the aftershock rate with three modiﬁed Omori laws, using
only 80 events. The result of Felzer et al. [2003] are unreli-
able because the number of events is too small to obtain a
reasonable estimate of the ETAS parameters and therefore
to derive the ratio of secondary aftershocks.

We now recall the formulation of the ETAS model and
its main results that will be useful for calculating the im-
portance of earthquake interactions.

2. The ETAS model of triggered seismicity

The present parametric form of the ETAS model used
in this paper was formulated by Ogata [1988]. See [Ogata,
1999] and [Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002a] for reviews of its
origins, a description of the diﬀerent versions of the model
and of its applications to model and predict seismic activity,
and for a discussion of the values of the ETAS parameter in
real seismicity. The ETAS model assumes that a given event
of magnitude mi ≥ m0 occurring at time ti triggers other
events in the time interval between t and t + dt at the rate

φmi (t − ti) = ρ(mi)Φ(t − ti).

Φ(t) is the direct Omori law normalized to 1

Φ(t) =

θcθ
(t + c)1+θ ,

(1)

(2)

where c is a regularizing time scale that ensures that the
seismicity rate remains ﬁnite close to the mainshock. The
average number of aftershocks triggered directly by an event
of magnitude m is

ρ(m) = k10α(m−m0 ),

(3)

where m0 is a lower bound magnitude below which no
daughter is triggered. The model is complemented by the
Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law, which states that each earth-
quake has a magnitude independently chosen according to
the density distribution P (m) = b ln(10)10−b(m−m0 ). The
model can also be extended to include the spatial distribu-
tion of seismicity [Ogata 1999]. The key parameter of the
ETAS model (1) is the average number (or “branching ra-
tio”) n of directly triggered earthquakes per mother-event.
This average is performed over time and over all possible
mother magnitudes. This average branching ratio n has a

ﬁnite value for θ > 0 and for α < b, it is equal to

n ≡

dt

P (m)ρ(m)Φ(t)dm =

The normal regime corresponds to the subcritical case n < 1
for which the seismicity rate decays after a mainshock to a
constant level (in the case of a steady-state source). Note
that the realized number of aftershocks for a given earth-
quake is not n but depends on its magnitude, according to
the function ρ(m) given by (3).

The total seismicity rate (or intensity) λ(t) at time t is
given by the sum of the “external” source s(t) and of the
aftershocks triggered by all previous events

λ(t) = s(t) +

φmi (t − ti).

(5)

Xi|ti≤t

This external source s(t) acts as a driving force ensuring
that the seismicity does not vanish, and it models the eﬀect
of the tectonic and other forcing processes.

Taking the ensemble average of (5) over many possible re-
alizations of the seismicity, we obtain the following equation
for the ﬁrst moment or statistical average N (t) of λ(t) [Sor-
nette and Sornette, 1999; Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002a]

N (t) = s(t) + n

The average seismicity rate is the solution of this self-
consistent integral equation, which embodies the fact that
each event may start a sequence of events, which can them-
selves trigger secondary events, and so on.

The global rate of aftershocks including indirect after-
shocks triggered by a mainshock of magnitude m occurring
at t = 0 is given by S = ρ(m)K(t)/n, where the renormal-
ized Omori law K(t) is obtained as a solution of (6) with
the general source term s(t) replaced by the Dirac function
δ(t). The solution for K(t) can be obtained as the following
series [Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002a]

where the characteristic time t∗ is given by t∗ ≈ c|1−n|−1/θ .
t∗ is inﬁnite for n = 1 and becomes very small for n ≪ 1.
For α > b/2 and n ≈ 1 large ﬂuctuations dominate the
dynamics.
In this regime, the ensemble average K(t) be-
comes an unreliable estimation of typical seismic catalogs
and often over-estimates the observed seismicity rate λ(t).
The eﬀect of the cascade of direct, secondary, and later-
generation aftershocks is to renormalize the bare Omori law
Φ(t) ∼ 1/t1+θ given by (2) into K(t) ∼ 1/t1−θ at early times
t ≪ t∗, as illustrated by Figure 1. This ﬁgure also shows the
rates Ni(t) of aftershocks of generation i, for i = 1 to 20.
Taking an ensemble average, we predict N1(t) = nSΦ(t),

role and importance of the successive generation of indirect
aftershocks in the construction of the global observable seis-
micity.

We estimate the ratio of triggered seismicity over total
seismicity in section 3 and the proportion of secondary af-
tershocks over total aftershocks in section 4, and we show
that these two quantities are equal to the branching ratio n.

the product of n1 with the average number of aftershocks
per earthquake deﬁned by n. Therefore n2 = ρ(M )n. The
number of third generation aftershocks of the mainshock is
n3 = ρ(M )n2. The number of aftershocks for the ith gen-
eration is ni = ρ(M )ni−1. The total number of aftershocks
triggered by a mainshock of magnitude M is thus given by

3. Proportion of aftershocks

Let us consider the situation in which s(t) corresponds
to a constant Poisson source process with intensity µ, rep-
resenting the eﬀect of tectonic loading. Then, the observed
seismicity results both from this constant tectonic source
rate and from the direct and indirect aftershocks triggered
In the regime n < 1,
by this constant tectonic loading.
the global seismicity is stationary, with large ﬂuctuations
following large earthquakes due to the triggered aftershock
sequences. The rate of aftershocks r0 triggered directly by
the tectonic source µ is on average r1 = µn because each
single event triggers on average n events, when averaging
over all magnitudes. The rate of second generation after-
shocks, triggered by aftershocks of the tectonic source, is
r2 = nr1 = µn2. At the ith generation, the rate of after-
shocks triggered indirectly by the tectonic source µ is given
by ri = µni. Summing over all generations, the global rate
Raf t of direct and indirect aftershocks of the tectonic source
in the sub-critical regime n < 1 is given by

(10)

The result (10) shows that the eﬀect of the cascade of after-
shocks of aftershocks and so on is to renormalize the tectonic
source µ to a higher level R that increases as n is close to
the critical value 1, as illustrated in Figure (2). This result
is well-known in the branching process literature [Harris,
1963] and has also been derived by Kagan [1991] for the
slightly modiﬁed version of the ETAS model using c = 0
and replacing it by an abrupt cut-oﬀ at early times.

The proportion of aftershocks (of any generation) is thus
equal to Raf t./R = n. This expression shows that the av-
erage branching ratio n can be directly observed from a

algorithms for detecting and counting aftershocks provide
a direct estimation and in general a lower bound of n be-
cause most triggered events cannot be distinguished from
the background seismicity. Note that the result (10) can
also be derived directly from the master equation (6) by
inserting s(t) = µ in (6) and taking the expectation of N (t).

For n ≪ 1, S ≈ ρ(M ), i.e., most aftershocks are directly
triggered by the mainshock. For n ≈ 1, S ≫ ρ(M ), i.e.,
most aftershocks are indirect aftershocks of the mainshock.
The proportion of indirect aftershocks is given by

(12)

This result (12) shows the fraction among all aftershocks
of the aftershocks triggered indirectly by the mainshock is
given by the average branching ratio n. We can also de-
rive the result (12) from the master equation (6). Inserting
s(t) = δ(t)ρ(M ) in (6) and taking the integral of (6) gives
the global number of direct and indirect aftershocks

which recovers expression (11) for S.

The branching ratio n gives the proportion of indirect af-
tershocks averaged over the whole aftershock sequence. It
is diﬀerent from the instantaneous proportion of indirect af-
tershocks ν(t) that is deﬁned by

ν(t) =

K(t) − Φ(t)
K(t)

(14)

which can be computed analytically using expression (7) for
K(t). The instantaneous proportion of indirect aftershocks
increases from 0 for very small times t ≪ c (all aftershocks
are triggered directly by the mainshock) to a maximum value
smaller than one at large times t ≫ t∗ given by

5. Conclusion

4. Proportion of indirect aftershocks

There is another interpretation for n as well as an addi-
tional empirical tool to estimate it. We calculate the total
number of aftershocks nt triggered by a mainshock of magni-
tude M , including all the generations of direct and indirect
aftershocks, as follows. The number of direct aftershocks
is given by n1 = ρ(M ) using the deﬁnition (1). The aver-
age number of second generation aftershocks n2 is given by

We have shown that, in the ETAS model, the propor-
tion of triggered seismicity is equal to the proportion of sec-
ondary aftershocks, and it is given by the branching ratio.
This parameter n thus measures the relative importance of
the stress change induced by the external tectonic loading
and of the stress change due to interactions between earth-
quakes. The proportion of secondary aftershocks can be es-
timated from the proportion of aftershocks, measured using

4

the ETAS model [Kagan, 1991] or any declustering algo-
rithm. Our results together with observations of real seis-
micity suggest that most earthquakes are triggered earth-
quakes, and that most aftershocks occurring a few hours or
days after a mainshock are triggered indirectly by the main-
shock. The importance of indirect aftershocks casts doubts
on the relevance of calculations of direct stress transfer func-
tions to predict aftershock rates [Stein, 1999]. It also opens
the road for improved methods of seismicity forecasts [Helm-
stetter and Sornette, 2002b].

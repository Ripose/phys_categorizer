A couple of orthogonal coordinates for dipole geometry are proposed for numerical simulations
of plasma geophysics in the Earth’s dipole magnetic ﬁeld. These coordinates have proper metric
proﬁles along ﬁeld lines in contrast to the standard dipole coordinate system that is commonly used
in analytical studies for dipole geometry.

In the study of plasma geophysics, an orthogonal coordinate system deﬁned by a dipole ﬁeld is commonly used
because of the Earth’s dipole magnetic ﬁeld Bd. The standard dipole coordinate system (µ, χ, φ) is deﬁned through
the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) as

where r is length from Earth’s center, normalized by its radius 1Re, θ is colatitude, and φ is the longitude. The
coordinate µ is a potential function of a dipole ﬁeld, Bd ∝ ∇
µ, and constant–χ curves in a meridian plane, φ = const.,
denote dipole ﬁled lines.

Since (µ, χ, φ) is an orthogonal system, their metric terms are simply given by

by, for example, a ﬁnite diﬀerence method in the computational (µ, χ, φ) space.

The above standard dipole coordinates is convenient and certainly appropriate for analytical studies in which the
Earth’s dipolar ﬁeld plays central roles. It also works as a base coordinates for the node and cell generation of the
ﬁnite element method in the dipole geometry [2, 3]. However, when one tries to use other numerical methods in which
analytical expression of the metric terms are important for preserving numerical simplicity and accuracy, as in the
case of the ﬁnite diﬀerence method, the standard dipole coordinate (µ, χ, φ) cannot be used in its original form since
the metric hµ changes intensely along the ﬁeld lines.

It should be noted that hµ ∝ |

−1 from the above deﬁnitions, which means that hµ is roughly proportional to
r3. Therefore, the metric hµ at r = 1 is O(103) larger than that at r = 10. Fig. 1(a) shows the hµ proﬁle along a ﬁeld
line starting from 70◦N as a function of µ. (We suppose that the north pole is located in θ = 0 in this note.) This
ﬁeld line goes through the equator (µ = 0) at r = 8.55. Note the sharp peak in Fig. 1(a) at the equator.

When one uses the ﬁnite central diﬀerence method, the grid spacing along the ﬁeld line is given by ∆sµ = hµ ∆µ.

Fig. 2 shows grid point distribution in the standard dipole coordinates. The grid size in the ﬁgure is Nµ×
(101 grids along each ﬁeld line and 10 grids in the perpendicular direction.) The starting points of the ﬁeld lines are

between 65◦N and 70◦N at r = 1. All the grid points are shown in the ﬁgure without any skip. It is clearly seen that
the resolution near the equator is so poor that any numerical simulation on this grid system is impractical. Also note
that the imbalance of the grid spacings between the near Earth and the near equatorial regions along the ﬁeld lines
causes unnecessarily severe restriction on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition in explicit time integration schemes.
For some numerical simulations such as the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, it is certainly desirable to use a
grid system that has a natural grid convergence near the ionosphere to resolve ﬁne structures near the coupling region,
but the three-orders of magnitude is obviously too much. This is especially serious when one tries to simulate some
phenomena in which relatively high resolution near the equator is required. An example of such simulation is the
auroral arc formation by the feedback instability driven by vortex ﬂow in the equator [11, 12].

A trivial way to avoid the poor resolution problem of the standard dipole coordinates near the equator is to place
the computational grid points along the µ space in a nonuniform way. In this case, the metric factors have to be
numerically calculated. For example, Lee and Lysak [6, 7] determined the grid spacing due to the local Alfv´en wave
speed. The same approach was adopted in Budnik et al. [1]. However, this method injures the generality of the dipole
coordinates as well as its analytical nature.

If one prefers to fully numerical methods, refer to Proehl et al. [9] in which a general algorithm to construct grid
In contrast to that approach,
points along an arbitrarily given magnetic ﬁeld, including the dipole, is presented.
we propose in this note analytical as well as simple coordinate transformations of µ that lead to practical metric
distributions along the ﬁeld line.

II. TRANSFORMATION FORMULA OF THE DIPOLE COORDINATES

Before we go into the description on the modiﬁed dipole coordinates deﬁned by the coordinate transformation of the
standard dipole coordinates, we derive analytical expressions of the inverse transformation from the standard dipole
coordinates (µ, χ, φ) into the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) since we could not ﬁnd these expressions in the literature
and they can be directly applied to the modiﬁed dipole coordinates described later.

III. MODIFIED DIPOLE COORDINATES

The problem of the metric imbalance along ﬁeld lines in the standard dipole coordinates originates from the power
2 of the µ’s denominator r2 in eq. (1). Therefore, one simple idea to reduce the steep metric distribution in the
standard dipole coordinates shown in Fig. 1(a) is to use a coordinates (µ′, χ, φ) in which ﬁeld-aligned coordinate µ′,
instead of µ, is deﬁned as

√cos θ

As the parameter a increases, grid points near the Earth (r = 1) along ﬁeld lines, which are highly concentrated in
the standard dipole coordinates (see the upper panel of Fig. 2), move toward the equator along the ﬁeld lines. The
denominator ¯a in eq. (17) is introduced to keep the transformed coordinate ψ being always in the range of [

The standard dipole coordinates (µ, χ, φ) deﬁned by eq. (1) is not a good choice for a base grid in numerical studies
since the metric contrast along each ﬁeld line is too intense. Instead of the standard dipole coordinate, we propose to
use the modiﬁed orthogonal dipole coordinates deﬁned by

with a tuning parameter a of the metric distribution along ﬁeld lines.

For problems in which a symmetry around the equator between the northern and southern hemispheres is present,

one can also try another form of modiﬁed orthogonal dipole coordinates deﬁned by

Recently, an orthogonal dipole coordinates that is designed so that the lower-most constant-µ surface coincides
with a constant-r surface (i.e., a sphere) is presented [8]. It is straightforward and eﬀective to apply the coordinate
transformations presented in this note for that nonorthogonal dipole coordinates, too.

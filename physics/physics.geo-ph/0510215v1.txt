Abstract

Electric signals have been recently recorded at the Earth’s surface with amplitudes appreciably

larger than those hitherto reported. Their entropy in natural time is smaller than that, Su, of

a “uniform” distribution. The same holds for their entropy upon time-reversal. This behavior,

as supported by numerical simulations in fBm time series and in an on-oﬀ intermittency model,

stems from inﬁnitely ranged long range temporal correlations and hence these signals are probably

Seismic Electric Signals (critical dynamics). The entropy ﬂuctuations are found to increase upon

approaching bursting, which reminds the behavior identifying sudden cardiac death individuals

when analysing their electrocardiograms.

The time series analysis of various phenomena in complex systems (and especially those

associated with impending catastrophic events, e.g.[1, 2]) in the framework of the newly

deﬁned time-domain[3, 4], termed natural time, reveals interesting features. Examples are

electrocardiograms[5, 6], seismicity[3] and Seismic Electric Signals (SES) activities[3, 4, 7,

8, 9, 10]. This new time domain is optimal for enhancing the signals in time-frequency space

when employing the Wigner function and measuring its localization property[11].

In a time series comprising N pulses, the natural time χk = k/N serves as the index[3, 4]

for the occurrence of the k-th event.

It is, therefore, smaller than, or equal to, unity.

In natural time analysis, the time evolution of the pair of the two quantities (χk, Qk) is

considered, where Qk denotes the duration of the k-th pulse. The entropy S in the natural

time-domain is deﬁned[8] as the derivative of the function hχqi − hχiq in respect to q, for

q = 1, which gives [3, 8]:

S ≡ hχ ln χi − hχi lnhχi

(1)

N
n=1 Qn. It is a dynamic entropy depending
where hf (χ)i = P
on the sequential order of pulses[5, 6] and exhibits[9] concavity, positivity and Lesche[12, 13]

stability. When the system enters the critical stage (inﬁnitely ranged long range temporal

correlations[3, 4]), the S-value is smaller[8, 10] than the value Su(= 1/2 ln 2 − 1/4 ≈ 0.0966)

of a “uniform” distribution (deﬁned in Refs. [3, 4, 6, 8], e.g. when when all pk are equal),

i.e.,

S < Su

(2)

The value of the entropy obtained upon considering the time reversal T , i.e., T pk = pN −k+1,

is labelled by S−. An important point emerged from the data analysis in Ref.[9] is the

following: Although the study of the S values enables the distinction between SES activities

and noises produced by nearby operating artiﬁcial (man made) electromagnetic sources

(AN), i.e., S < Su for the SES activities and S ' Su for AN, this does not hold for the S−

values. This is so, because for the SES activities we found that the S− values are smaller

than (or equal to) Su, while for AN the S− values are either smaller or larger than Su. Here,

we provide more recent data on the SES activities, which strengthen the conclusion that

both S and S− are smaller than Su. In other words, the following key point seems to hold: In

signals that exhibit critical dynamics (i.e., SES activities) upon time-reversal their entropy

values (though become diﬀerent than those in forward time) still remain smaller than Su.

2

Why? The answer to this question is a challenge, because, if it is generally so, among

similar looking signals we can distinguish those that exhibit critical dynamics. Since the

latter signals are expected to exhibit inﬁnitely ranged long range correlations, this might be

the origin of the aforementioned behavior. To investigate this point, numerical simulations

are presented here for fractional Brownian motion (fBm) time series as well as for an on-oﬀ

intermittency model (for the selection of the latter see Ref.[14]). The simple case of an fBm

was selected in view of the following suggestion forwarded in Ref.[7] concerning the Hurst

exponent H. If we assume that, in general, H is actually a measure of the intensity of long

range dependence, we may understand why in SES activities, when analyzed in the natural

time domain, we ﬁnd H values close to unity, while in AN (where the long range correlations

are weaker[7]) the H-values are markedly smaller (e.g., around 0.7 to 0.8).

We ﬁrst present the recent experimental results. Figure 1 depicts ﬁve electric signals,

labelled M1,M2, M3, M4 and V1, that have been recorded on March 21, 23 and April 7,

2005. Note that the ﬁrst four (M1 to M4) have amplitudes that not only are one order

of magnitude larger than the ﬁfth one (V1, see Fig.1c), but also signiﬁcantly exceed those

hitherto reported[15]. The way they are read in natural time can be seen in Fig.2. The

analysis of these signals leads to the S and S− values given in Table I, an inspection of which

reveals that they are actually smaller than Su. Hence, on the basis of the aforementioned

criterion, these signals cannot be classiﬁed as AN, but they are likely to be SES activities.

Note that, although in general S is diﬀerent than S−, no deﬁnite conclusion can be drawn

on the sign of S − S− (see also Table I of Ref.[9]).

We now present our results on fBm. We ﬁrst clarify that Weron et al.[16] recently studied

an algorithm distinguishing between the origins (i.e., the memory and the tails of the process)

of the self-similarity of a given time series on the base of the computer test suggested in

Ref.[17]. By applying it to the SES activities, they found the fBm as the appropriate type

of modelling process. The fBm, which is H-self similar with stationary increments and it is

the only Gaussian process with such properties for 0 < H < 1[18], can be simulated[19, 20],

see also pp.321 -323 of Ref.[21], by randomizing a construction due to Weierstrass, i.e., using

the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function[22]:

w(t) = X

cl

l

sin(blt + dl)
blH

,

(3)

where b > 1, cl normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, and dl are

3

uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 2π] (cf. when using the increments of Eq.(3) one

can also produce fractional Gaussian noise of a given H). By using Eq. (3), fBm for various

values of H were produced, the one-signed segments of which were analyzed in the natural

time domain (an example is given in Ref.[14]). The Monte-Carlo simulation results for each

segment include not only the values of the entropies S and S−, but also the exponent αDF A

of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)[23, 24]. For segments of small number of

points N (cf. only segments with N > 40 were considered), the value of αDF A may vary

signiﬁcanly from that expected for a given value of H; DFA was preferred, because it is one

of the few well-deﬁned and robust estimators of the scaling properties for such segments(e.g.

[7], see also pp. 300-301 of Ref.[10]). The results are shown in Fig.3, in which we plot

the S and S− values versus αDF A. Since the analysis of the SES activities in natural time

result[7, 8] in DFA exponents αDF A around unity, hereafter we are solely focused in Fig.3

in the range 0.8 < αDF A < 1.2. An inspection of this ﬁgure reveals the following three

conclusions: First, despite the large standard deviation, we may say that both S and S− are

smaller than Su(≈ 0.0966) when αDF A ≈ 1. Second, S and S− are more or less comparable.

Third, comparing the computed S and S− values (≈ 0.08 for αDF A ≈ 1) with those resulting

from the analysis of the SES activities (see Table I, see also Table I of Ref.[9]), we ﬁnd a

reasonable agreement. Note that these computations do not result in a deﬁnite sign for

S − S− in a similar fashion with the experimental results.

In what remains, we present our results on a simple on-oﬀ intermittency model. We clarify

that on-oﬀ intermittency is a phase-space mechanism that allows dynamical systems to

undergo bursting (bursting is a phenomenon in which episodes of high activity are alternated

with periods of inactivity likewise in Fig.2e). This mechanism is diﬀerent from the well

known Pomeau-Manneville scenario for the behavior of a system in the proximity of a saddle-

node bifurcation[25]. Here, we use the simple model of the driven logistic map

Xt+1 = A(Yt)Xt[1 − Xt]

where we assume that the quantity A(Yt) is monotonic function of Yt and that 0 ≤ A ≤ 4

(cf. A is further speciﬁed below). The system has the invariant manifold X = 0 and the

level of its activity is measured by Xt[26]. In order to have the on-oﬀ mechanism in action,

we specialize to the case of a noise-driven logistic map, with

(4)

(5)

A(Yt) = A0 + αYt

4

where Yt is δ-correlated noise which is uniformly-distributed in the interval [0,1] and A0 and

α are parameters. In order to have 0 ≤ A ≤ 4, we assume[26] A0 ≥ 0, α ≥ 0 and A0 + α ≤ 4.

The relevant parameter plane for the noise-driven system of Eqs.(4) and (5) (as well as the

parameter range for which the ﬁxed point X = 0 is stable) can be found in Fig. 1 of Ref.[26],

while the description of the intermittent dynamics is given in Refs.[27, 28, 29]. Bursting is

observed in the temporal evolution of Xt as the stability of the ﬁxed point X = 0 varies.

Following Ref.[28], for A0 = 0 there is a critical value αc > 1, below which the system

asymptotically tends to the ﬁxed point X = 0, without any sustained intermittent bursting.

For this case, i.e., A0 = 0, the value αc = e ≡ 2.71828 . . . leads to on-oﬀ intermittency[26].

In the intermittent system under discusssion, both the signal amplitude and the power

spectrum resulted[26] in power-law distributions (with low frequencies predominating in the

power-spectrum)

Several time-series have been produced for the above on-oﬀ intermittency model with

the following procedure: The system was initiated at a time (tin = −200) with a uniformly

distributed value Xtin in the region [0, 1], and then the mapping of Eqs.(4) and (5) was

followed until N events will occur after t = 0. The results for Xt, t = 1, 2 . . . N were

analyzed in natural time domain and the values of S and S− have been determined. This

was repeated 103 times (for a given number, N, of events) and the average values of S and

S− have been deduced. These values are plotted in Fig.4(a) versus (α − e)N 1/2 (The factor

N 1/2 stems from ﬁnite size scaling eﬀects, since for large values of N, e.g., N >15000, a

scaling -reminiscent of a 1st order phase transition- was observed, details on which will be

published elsewhere). This ﬁgure reveals that as the critical value is approached from below

(i.e., α → e−) both S and S− are smaller than Su. Note that Fig.4(a) also indicates that S

is probably larger than S−, while in the fBm time series no deﬁnite sign for S − S− could

be obtained.

Another interesting point resulted from the on-oﬀ intermittency model is depicted in

Fig.4(b), where we plot the ﬂuctuations δS and δS− (i.e., the standard deviations of the

entropies S and S−, respectively) versus (α − e)N 1/2. It is clearly seen that these ﬂuctu-

ations are dramatically enhanced as the critical value is approached (i.e., α → e). This is

strikingly reminiscent of our earlier results[5, 6] upon analyzing electrocardiograms (ECG)

in natural time domain and studying the so called QT intervals. These results showed that

the ﬂuctuations of the entropy δS(QT ) are appreciably larger in sudden cardiac death (SD)

5

individuals than those in truly healthy (H) humans (see Fig. 2 of Ref.[6]). We emphasize

that the aforementioned points should not be misinterpreted as stating that the simple logis-

tic map model treated here can capture the complex heart dynamics, but only can be seen

in the following frame: Since sudden cardiac arrest (which may occur even if the electrocar-

diogram looks similar to that of H) may be considered as a dynamic phase transition[5, 6], it

is reasonable to expect that the entropy ﬂuctuations signiﬁcantly increase upon approaching

the transition.

In summary, recently recorded electric signals (having the largest amplitudes recorded

to date) exhibit the property that both S and S− are smaller than Su and hence are likely

to be SES activities (critical dynamics). This property seems to stem from their inﬁnitely

ranged long range correlations as supported by computational results in: (1) fBm time

series and (2) a simple on-oﬀ intermittency model. The latter model also suggests that the

ﬂuctuations (δS and δS−) signiﬁcantly increase upon approaching the transition, which is

strikingly reminiscent of the increased δS-values found for the QT-intervals for the sudden

cardiac death individuals.

Abstract

We report an empirical determination of the probability density functions Pdata(r) of the number r of

earthquakes in ﬁnite space-time windows for the California catalog, over ﬁxed spatial boxes 5

and time intervals dt = 1, 10, 100 and 1000 days. We ﬁnd a stable power law tail Pdata(r)

with exponent µ

1.6 for all time intervals. These observations are explained by a simple stochastic

≈

branching process previously studied by many authors, the ETAS (epidemic-type aftershock sequence)

model which assumes that each earthquake can trigger other earthquakes (“aftershocks”). An aftershock

sequence results in this model from the cascade of aftershocks of each past earthquake. We develop

the full theory in terms of generating functions for describing the space-time organization of earthquake

sequences and develop several approximations to solve the equations. The calibration of the theory to

the empirical observations shows that it is essential to augment the ETAS model by taking account of

the pre-existing frozen heterogeneity of spontaneous earthquake sources. This seems natural in view of

the complex multi-scale nature of fault networks, on which earthquakes nucleate. Our extended theory is

able to account for the empirical observation satisfactorily. In particular, the adjustable parameters are

determined by ﬁtting the largest time window dt = 1000 days and are then used as frozen in the formulas

for other time scales, with very good agreement with the empirical data.

INTRODUCTION

Many papers purport to characterize the space-time organization of seismicity in diﬀerent regions

of the world. Recent claims of universal laws for the distribution of waiting times and seismic rates

between earthquakes have derived from the analyses of space-time windows [1, 2]. The ﬂurry

of interest from physicists comes from their fascination with the self-similar properties exhibited

by seismicity (Gutenberg-Richter power law of earthquake seismic moments, Omori decay law

of aftershock rates, fractal and multifractal space-time organization of earthquakes and faults)

together with the development of novel concepts and techniques that may provide new insights

[3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

The interest is no less vivid among seismologists and geophysicists in characterizing the space-

time properties of seismicity, because it allows them to understand the dynamics of plate motion

(at large scales), to constrain the interaction between faults, as well as to develop better hazard as-

sessment. Recently, an additional incentive is provided by the development of forecasting models of

seismicity, for instance within the RELM (Regional Earthquake Likelihood Models: www.relm.org)

project in Southern California. In the RELM project, a forecast is expressed as a vector of earth-

quake rates speciﬁed for each multi-dimensional bin [8], where a bin is deﬁned by an interval

of location, time, magnitude and focal mechanism and the resolution of a model corresponds to

the bin sizes. Then, expectations and likelihoods can be estimated and used for the comparison

between diﬀerent forecasting methods.

A fundamental issue is testing models’ prediction is to take into account so-called aftershock

clustering. In one way or another, most if not all models use some form of declustering approach

to remove the eﬀect of aftershocks which otherwise dominate and obscure the desired information

about the model’s performance [8]. Then, with such declustered catalogs, the likelihood of forecasts

are estimated using Poissonian probabilities. But, if the catalog is only partially declustered (which

it will most probably be as there are no agreed upon fully eﬃcient method of declustering), then

our contribution in this paper is to show that the distribution of event numbers should present

a tail much more heavy than predicted by the Poissonian statistics and to propose a theoretical

explanation for it. Pisarenko and Golubeva [9] introduced a model to decluster catalogs by so-to-

say Poisson “with random parameter,” which resulted in a law with slowly decreasing probabilities

(actually a stable L´evy law) for the distribution of rates.

3

We improve on preceding results on several points. Our ﬁrst contribution is to show that the

heavy tail nature of the distribution of seismic rate is intrinsic to a class of generic models of

triggered seismicity. Speciﬁcally, our theory is based on a simple model of earthquake triggering,

in which future seismicity is a conditional Poisson process, with average rates (or Poisson intensity)

conditioned on past seismicity. We show that the exponential Poisson rate is renormalized into a

power law tail by the mechanism involving a cascade of earthquake triggering. Our theory thus

provides a prediction for the distribution of seismic rates in space-time bins in the form of a power

law tail distribution. Our second contribution is to show that our prediction is veriﬁed by empirical

seismic rates in Southern California over more than two decades. In addition, our theory accounts

well for the evolution of the distribution of seismic rates as a function of the time window size from

1 day to 1000 days.

This implies that spontaneous ﬂuctuations of the number of triggered earthquakes in space-time

bins may be simply due to the cascades of triggering processes, which lead to dramatic departures

from the Poisson model used as one of the building block of standard testing procedures. Account-

ing for the intrinsic heavy tail nature of the distribution of seismic rate may explain, we believe,

many of the contradictions and rejections of models assessed on the basis of Poisson statistics of

so-called declustered catalogs. This also suggests the need for fundamentally diﬀerent earthquake

prediction models and testing methods. Our results also oﬀer a simple alternative explanation to

so-called universal laws [1, 2] in terms of cascades of triggered earthquakes: our proposed framework

explains the observed power law distributions of seismic rates from the fundamentals of seismicity

characterized by a few exponents.

II. THE EPIDEMIC-TYPE AFTERSHOCK SEQUENCE (ETAS) BRANCHING

MODEL OF EARTHQUAKES WITH LONG MEMORY

We study the general branching process, called the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS)

model of triggered seismicity, introduced by Ogata in the present form [10] and by Kagan and

Knopoﬀ in a slightly diﬀerent form [11] and whose main statistical properties are reviewed in [12].

For completeness and in order to ﬁx notations, we recall its deﬁnition and ingredients used in our

analysis that follows. In this model, all earthquakes are treated on the same footing and there

is no distinction between foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks, other than from retrospective

4

human-made classiﬁcation. The advantage of the ETAS model is its conceptual simplicity based

on three independent well-found empirical laws and its power of explanation of other empirical

observations (see for instance [13] and references therein).

The ETAS model belongs to a general class of branching processes [14, 15], and has in addition

the property that the variance of the number of earthquake progenies triggered in direct lineage from

a given mother earthquake is mathematically inﬁnite. Moreover, a long-time (power law) memory

of the impact of a mother on her ﬁrst-generation daughters describes the empirical Omori law for

aftershocks. These two ingredients together with the mechanism of cascades of branching have been

shown to give rise to subdiﬀusion [16, 17] and to non mean-ﬁeld behavior in the distribution of the

total number of aftershocks per mainshock, in the distribution of the total number of generations

before extinctions [18] and in the distribution of the total duration of an aftershock sequence before

extinction [19].

conditional average number

In the ETAS model, each earthquake is a potential progenitor or mother, characterized by its

of children (triggered events or aftershocks of ﬁrst generation), where

Nm ≡

κµ(m)

µ(m) = 10α(m
−

m0) ,

is a mark associated with an earthquake of magnitude m > m0 (in the language of “marked point

processes”), κ is a constant factor and m0 is the minimum magnitude of earthquakes capable

of triggering other earthquakes. The meaning of the term “conditional average” for Nm is the

following: for a given earthquake of magnitude m and therefore of mark µ(m), the number r of its

daughters of ﬁrst generation are drawn at random according to the Poissonian statistics

(1)

(2)

(3)

pµ(r) =

e−

Nm =

e−

κµ .

N r
m
r!

(κµ)r
r!

Nm is the expectation of the number of daughters of ﬁrst generation, conditioned on a ﬁxed

magnitude m and mark µ(m). The expression (2) for µ(m) is chosen in such a way that it

reproduces the empirical dependence of the average number of aftershocks triggered directly by

an earthquake of magnitude m (see [20] and references therein). Expression (1) with (2) gives the

so-called productivity law of a given mother as a function of its magnitude. The challenge of our

5

present analysis is to understand how the exponential distribution (3) is changed by taking into

account all earthquake triggering paths simultaneously and at all possible generations.

The ETAS model is complemented by the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) density distribution of earth-

quake magnitudes

p(m) = b ln(10) 10−

b(m

m0) , m > m0 ,

−

(4)

such that

∞m p(x)dx gives the probability that an earthquake has a magnitude equal to or larger
R
than m. This magnitude distribution p(m) is assumed to be independent of the magnitude of the

triggering earthquake, i.e., a large earthquake can be triggered by a smaller one [13, 20].

Combining (4) and (2) shows that the earthquake marks µ and therefore the conditional average

number Nm of daughters of ﬁrst generation are distributed according to the normalized power law

pµ(µ) =

γ
µ1+γ ,

1

µ < +

,

∞

γ = b/α .

For earthquakes, b

1 and 0.5 < α < 1 giving 1 < γ < 2 (see [21] for a review of values quoted

≈

in the literature and their implications). This range 1 < γ < 2 implies that the mathematical

expectation of µ and therefore of Nm (performed over all possible magnitudes) is ﬁnite but its

variance is inﬁnite (the marginal case α = 1 leading to γ = 1 requires the existence of an upper

magnitude cut-oﬀ [21]).

For a ﬁxed γ, the coeﬃcient κ then controls the value of the average number n (or branching

ratio) of children of ﬁrst generation per mother:

n =

where the average

is taken over all mothers’ magnitudes drawn from the GR law. Recall

Nmi

h

that the values n < 1, n = 1 and n > 1 correspond respectively to the sub-critical, critical and

super-critical regimes.

The next ingredient of the ETAS model consists in the speciﬁcation of the space-time rate

function Nm Φ(r

ri, t

ti) giving the average rate of ﬁrst generation daughters at time t and

−

−

position r created by a mother of magnitude m > m0 occurring at time ti and position ri:

The time propagator Φ(t) has the Omori law form
θcθ

Φ(x, t) = Φ(t) φ(x) .

Φ(t) =

(c + t)1+θ H(t)

6

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

where H(t) is the Heaviside function, 0 < θ < 1, c is a regularizing time scale that ensures that

the seismicity rate remains ﬁnite close to the mainshock. The time decay rate (8) is called the

“direct Omori law” [12, 22]. Due to the process of cascades of triggering by which a mother

triggers daughters which then trigger their own daughters and so on, the direct Omori law (8) is

renormalized into a “dressed” or “renormalized” Omori law [12, 22], which is the one observed

empirically. The analysis below will retrieve and extend this result.

The space propagator is given by

φ(x) =

η dη
2π(x2 + d2)(η+2)/2 .

For our comparison with the empirical data, we shall consider the epicenter position of earthquakes,

that is, the 2D-projection on the earth surface of the real 3D-distribution of earthquake hypocenters.

Numerical implementations of the theory developed below will thus be done in 2D but it is easy

to generalize to 3D if/when the empirical data will be of suﬃcient quality to warrant it.

In the following, we will make use of the Laplace transform of the Omori law

ˆΦ(u) =

Φ(t) e−

ut dt = θ (cu)θ ecu Γ(

and of its asymptotic behavior

ˆΦ−

The Fourier transform of the space propagator (9) will also be useful:

In particular

˜φ(q) = e−

dq

(η = 1) ,

˜φ(q) = e−

dq(1 + dq)

(η = 3) .

The last ingredient of the ETAS model is to assume that plate tectonic motion induces spon-

taneous mother earthquakes, which are not triggered by previous earthquakes, according to a

Poissonian point process, such that the average number of spontaneous mother earthquakes per

unit time and per unit surface is ̺. In the ETAS branching model, each such spontaneous mother

earthquake then triggers independently its own space-time aftershocks branching process.

It is a well-established facts that, at large scale, earthquakes are preferentially clustered near

the plate boundaries while, at smaller scales, earthquakes are found mostly along faults and close

to nodes between several faults [23].

It is natural to extend the ETAS model to allow for the

heterogeneity of the spontaneous earthquake sources ̺ reﬂecting the inﬂuence of pre-existing fault

structures, some rheological heterogeneity and complex spatial stress distributions. We get some

guidelines from the distribution of the stress ﬁeld in heterogeneous media and due to earthquakes

[24] which should be close to a Cauchy distribution or probably more generally to a power law

[25, 26] (see also Chap. 17 of [27]).

The simplest prescription is thus to assume that ̺ is itself random and distributed according to

where

is then statistical average of the random space-time Poissonian source intensity ̺. In

The value δ = 0 gives the same tail as the Cauchy distribution advocated in [24] for the stress ﬁeld.

We have considered other functions, such as half-Gaussian, exponential, half-Cauchy but none of

them give satisfactory ﬁts to the data (see below). The parametrization (15) with δ > 0 allows us

to have only a single scale

controlling the typical ﬂuctuation of the random sources. We have

̺

h

found that only slightly positive values of δ (corresponding to tails a little fatter than the Cauchy

law) gives reasonable ﬁts to the data (see below). It is interesting to observe that the data on the

distribution of seismic rates thus seems to constrain signiﬁcantly the fractal distribution of seismic

sources.

BRANCHING PROCESS

III. GENERATING PROBABILITY FUNCTION (GPF) OF EARTHQUAKES

In this section, we describe the statistical properties of earthquake branching processes using

the technology of generating functions.

First, let us recall the GPF of the total number R1 of the ﬁrst-generation aftershocks of a mother

8

event of magnitude m can be easily obtained as

eµκ(z

−

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

using the fact that the rate of ﬁrst-generation aftershocks is Poissonian according to (3). In this

expression (16), κ and µ are given by their deﬁnition in (1) and (2).

Averaging (16) over the random parameter µ gives the GPF of the number R1 of ﬁrst generation

aftershocks triggered by a mother aftershock of arbitrary magnitude

G(z) = γκγ(1

z)γ Γ(

γ, κ(1

z)) .

Note that

is nothing but the branching ratio n deﬁned above in equation (6). Knowing the

R1i

expression (17) for the GPF G(z), one ﬁnds that the corresponding probabilities of the random

numbers R1 are equal to

P1(r) = Pr

R1 = r

Expression (19) implies that, for 1 < γ < 2, the variance of the random number R1 is inﬁnite. For

γ > 2, the variance is ﬁnite and is equal to

γ(γ

Figure 1 shows the probabilities (18) and their power law asymptotics for n = 1, γ = 1.25 and

γ = 3.

Let us now consider the set of independent space-time aftershock branching processes, triggered

by spontaneously arising mother earthquakes. Due to the independence between each sequence

triggered by each spontaneous event, it is easy to show that the GPF of the number of events

(including mother earthquakes and all their aftershocks of all generations), falling into the space-

time window

[t, t + τ ]

is equal to

DOW

{

Before discussing the properties of the distributions of aftershocks, we consider their simplest

statistical characteristics, namely the averages and rates of diﬀerent kinds of aftershocks. This

introduces the relevant characteristic scales in the time and in the space domains, which are found

inherent to the space-time branching processes. This also suggests the natural “large time window

approximation” used and tested below within the more general probabilistic treatment.

A. Average of the total number of events in the space time window

gives on average n daughters in direct lineage; each of these ﬁrst-generation daughters give n grand-

daughters, the average number of grand-daughters is thus n2, and the reasoning continues over all

generations. Summing over all generations, the total number of events triggered by a given source

plus the source itself is 1 + n + n2 + n3 + ..., which sums to 1/(1

n).

B.

Impact of mother earthquake sources occurring before the time window

Here, we use previous and other related relations in the goal of estimating the contribution of

the diﬀerent terms in the r.h.s. of Eq. (22) to the GPF Θsp(z, τ,

). Our goal is to prepare and

check for approximations that will be used below.

For instance, we shall assume that the contribution of the ﬁrst term in (22), which is responsible

for aftershocks triggered by earthquakes occurring before time t (i.e., outside the time window

[t, t + τ ]), is negligible if the corresponding relative events rate obeys the following condition

−

S

To check when this condition holds, notice that, due to (38), (40),

Nout(τ ) is solution of

V. LARGE TIME WINDOW APPROXIMATION

The analysis of the previous section gives us the possibility to explore the probabilistic properties

of the number of events in given space-time windows, in the regime where the large time window

(58)

(63)

approximation (51) holds. If the time duration τ of the space-time window is suﬃciently large, the

previous section has shown that the statistical averages and the seismic rates become independent

of τ . It seems reasonable to conjecture that the GPF Θ(z, τ,

S
triggered by some earthquake source inside the space domain

; x) of the total number of aftershocks

until time τ coincides approximately

S

; x) of the total number of aftershocks triggered by some earthquake

with the saturated GPF Θ(z,

S
source inside the space domain

S

. Within this approximation of large time windows, the eﬀect of

aftershocks triggered by earthquake sources occurring till the beginning t of the time window is

negligible. Section VII below will explore in more details the applicability of this conjecture.

Within this large time window approximation, one may ignore the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. of

Eq. (22) and replace Θ(z, t,

; x) by Θ(z,

; x) in the remaining terms. As a result, Eq. (22) takes

the following approximate form

where the function G is deﬁned in (17).

A. Factorization procedure

To ﬁnd a reasonable approximate expression for the sought GPF Θ(z,

; x), notice that if ℓ

S

(or if n is close to 1) then the characteristic spatial scale associated with the GPF Θ(z,

becomes greater than d. Therefore, without essential error, one may replace Θ

φ by Θ in (65). In

addition, we take into account the ﬁniteness of the domain

of replacing the last term of the argument of the function G in (65) as follows:

B. Probabilistic meaning of the factorization approximation (66) leading to (67) and

The factorization approximation (66) has the following implication. Calling Θ(z) the GPF of

the total number of aftershocks triggered over the whole space by some earthquake source, one can

then determine the corresponding GPF Θ(z,

The corresponding expression (79) can be interpreted as follows.

It gives the exact solution

for the GPF of some speciﬁc space-time branching process, such that the pdf f (y; x) of the space

of the earthquake source. For this problem, we have

In the general case, the relation (79) oﬀers the possibility, at least semi-quantitatively, to describe

the characteristic features of the space-time branching processes, by using the probability p

as an

eﬀective independent parameter of the theory.

Let us mention a few useful consequences of the relation (79). It implies that the probability

that r aftershocks fall into the spatial domain

is equal to

replace Eq. (78) by

This expression (110) allows us to make a precise quantitative prediction for the dependence of

the distribution Psp(r; ρ, p) of the number r of earthquakes per space-time window as a function

of r, once the model parameters n, γ, p, δ and ρ are given. We note that Pisarenko and Golubeva

have shown that the distribution of numbers has the same tail as the distribution of seismic rates

[9]. Thus, for the tails, our results can be interpreted either as statements on the distribution of

realized numbers of earthquakes or on the distribution of average seismic rates.

We now turn to a brief description of the data analysis and of their ﬁts with (110).

VI. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON WITH THEORY

We use the Southern Californian earthquakes catalog with revised magnitudes (available from

the Southern California Earthquake Center) as it is among the best one in terms of quality and

time span. Magnitudes ML are given with a resolution of 0.1 from 1932 to 2003, in a region from

approximately 32◦ to 37◦N in latitude, and from

114◦ to

122◦ in longitude. In order to maximize

−
the size and quality of the data used for the analysis (to improve the statistical signiﬁcance), we

−

consider the sub-catalog spanning the time interval 1994

2003 for ML > 1.5, which contains a

−

total of 86, 228 earthquakes. The completeness of this sub-catalog has been veriﬁed in the standard

way in [29] by computing the complementary cumulative magnitude distribution for each year from

24

1994 to 2003 included. The stability of the linear relationship of the logarithm of the number as a

function of magnitude ML for ML > 1.5 is taken as a diagnostic of completeness.

The spatial domain are covered by square boxes of (L = 5 km)

(L = 5 km), which gives us

×

16046 spatial bins, with many of them being actually empty. This size is a compromise between

conﬂicting requirements. On the one hand, a smaller spatial resolution should not be used due

to the errors of localization of earthquake epicenters, which are of this order. On the other hand,

increasing L decreases very fast (

1/L2) the total number of boxes with which the distribution of

∼

the number of events can be constructed. Four diﬀerent sizes for the time window are considered:

dt = 1 day (3652 temporal bins), dt = 10 days, dt = 100 days and dt = 1000 days. Combining

the space and time windows leads to space-time windows or bins of size L2

dt. For instance,

×

for dt = 1 day, there is a total of 54669 spatio-temporal bins with at least one event, with 4298

quakes in the space-time bins described above. The straight line in Figs. 8-10 is the best ﬁt with

since the ﬁtted values are µ = 1.65 for dt = 100 days, µ = 1.75 for dt = 10 days and µ = 1.60

for dt = 1 days. However, one can also observe at the same time that the pdf becomes more and

more curved in the larger portion of the bulk as the size dt of the time window is increased. This

behavior can be explained by our theory as we know describe.

First, all parameters are let free to adjust optimally. The parameters are the branching ratio n

deﬁned by (6), the exponent γ deﬁned in (5), the exponent δ deﬁned in (15), the parameter p

coming from the factorization procedure (66) and given by (69) and (70) (which is roughly equal to

the overall fraction of aftershocks triggered by sources in the domain

which fall within the same

S

domain

), and the average number ρ of spontaneous earthquake source per space-time bin deﬁned

S

in (89). The theoretical curves shown in Figures 7-10 are obtained by a numerical integration of

(110) for the set of parameters n = 0.96, γ = 1.1, p = 0.25, δ = 0.15 and ρ = 0.0019 dt days

with dt in units of days (thus equal to 1000 for Fig.7). Note that a given ρ for a given space-time

window [t, t + τ ]

translates into the following average number of events inside that window:

shown in Fig. 7. They are then frozen and the theoretical distribution is recalculated with formula

(110) with no adjustable parameters for the three other cases dt = 100 days (Fig. 8), dt = 10 days

(Fig. 9) and dt = 1 day (Fig. 10). The theory is thus able to account simultaneously for all the

considered time windows, with no adjustable parameters for the three smallest time windows.

Second, we test for the sensibility of the parameters. We actually obtain practically the same

quality of ﬁts for all four values dt = 1, ..., 1000 days by varying δ and γ in the ranges 0.1

δ < 0.2

and 1

1.5, by properly adjusting the other parameters adaptively. We do not show the

corresponding theoretical curves as they are essentially equally good to ﬁt the data within the

empirical noise. The choice δ close to zero is consistent with the choice of the Cauchy distribution

as a proxy for the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of spontaneous earthquake sources

inferred for the stress ﬁeld and deduced from previous theoretical [25, 26] and empirical analysis

of earthquake sources [24]. The strong sensitivity of the ﬁts with respect to the fractal structure

of the spontaneous sources quantiﬁed by the exponent δ is a surprising but positive return of this

work. We did not expect a priori that the distribution of seismic rates would teach so much about

the heterogeneity of the seismic active regions. But there is a lack of sensibility with respect γ.

Thus, the distribution of seismic rates cannot be used to constrain the productivity parameter α

(through γ = b/α) other than by conﬁrming the range of previous estimations of its value: α

1

≈

[30, 31], 0.5

α < 1 [20, 32, 33]. The sensitivity of the ﬁts with respect to the branching ratio

≤

n and to the overall fraction p of aftershocks which fall within the domain

requires a special

S

discussion which will be reported elsewhere.

We have also used functional forms for fδ(x) other than (15) to describe the pre-existing hetero-

geneity of spontaneous earthquake sources, such as half-Gaussian, exponential as well as diﬀerent

variants of power laws. Overall, we ﬁnd that we need fδ(x) to have a power law tail close to the

Cauchy distribution in order to get a reasonable ﬁt for all four time windows. This shows that the

ETAS model as well as any other model of this class of triggered seismicity need to be general-

ized to account for a pre-existing heterogeneity of the crust, which controls the occurrence of the

spontaneous earthquake sources.

We would also like to stress that, according to our theory, the value of the exponent µ

1.6

≈

used in (111) to ﬁt the tails of the distributions shown in Figs. 8-10 is describing a cross-over rather

26

than a genuine asymptotic tail. Recall that the distribution of the total number of aftershocks has

two power law regimes

The existence of this cross-over together with the concave shape of the distribution at small and

intermediate values of r combine to create an eﬀective power law with an apparent exponent µ

1.6

larger than the largest asymptotic exponent γ. We have veriﬁed this to be the case in synthetically

generated distributions with genuine asymptotics exponent γ = 1.25 for instance, which could be

well ﬁtted by µ

1.6 over several decades. We note also that Pisarenko and Golubeva [9], with

≈

a diﬀerent approach applied to much larger spatial box sizes in California, Japan and Pamir-Tien

Shan, have reported an exponent µ < 1 which could perhaps be associated with the intermediate

asymptotics characterized by the exponent 1/γ < 1, found in our analysis [18]. By using data

collapse with varying spatial box sizes on a California catalog, Corral ﬁnds that the distribution

of seismic rates exhibits a double power-law behavior with µ

0 for small rates and µ

1.2

for large rates [2]. The ﬁrst regime might be associated with the non universal bulk par of the

distribution found in our analysis. The second regime is perhaps compatible with the prediction

for the asymptotic exponent µ = γ.

VII. THEORETICAL TESTS OF THE THEORY USING STATISTICS CONDITIONED

ON GENERATION NUMBER

In our theoretical development to obtain the prediction (110) that could be compared with

empirical data, we have been obliged to make two approximations: (1) assuming that the duration

τ of the time window [t, t + τ ] is suﬃciently large (i.e., the inequality (51) holds), we have replaced

the GPF Θ(z, τ,

; x) by its asymptotics Θ(z,

; x); (2) we have used a factorization procedure to

S

S

take into account quantitatively the ﬁniteness of the spatial window

.

S

In this section, we attempt to clarify further the domain of application of these two approx-

imations by testing them on other event statistics conditioned on ﬁxed number of generations.

Numerical calculations of the exact PDF are compared with the approximations.

27

A. Large spatial windows

Let us consider the statistics of aftershocks triggered over the whole space during the ﬁrst k

generations by some mother event. The corresponding GPF of the number of aftershocks triggered

in the course of k generations is deﬁned by the following iterative recurrence equation

Θk(z) = G[zΘk

1(z)] ,

Θ1(z) = G(z) .

−

One can calculate the corresponding probabilities of aftershock numbers by using the Cauchy

integral

Furthermore, we can make use of the knowledge that, as k

, the GPF Θk(z) converges to the

asymptotic GPF Θ(z) which is the solution of Eq. (87). It is easy to show that one can calculate

the corresponding probabilities using an equality analogous to (93):

Figure 11 shows the distribution Pk(r) of aftershocks numbers, obtained by a numerical calculation

of the integral (113) for diﬀerent values k = 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and for γ = 1.25 and in the critical

case n = 1. It also shows the corresponding asymptotic distribution for k

+

obtained by

integration of (114). Note that, even for in this critical case, the distribution for k = 8 generations

is already almost undistinguishable from the asymptotic distribution including an inﬁnite number

of generations, at least for r 6 250. Figure 12 clariﬁes further the convergence rate by plotting the

ratio

for diﬀerent values k.

Pk(r)
P (r)

The information on the number of generations necessary to reach the asymptotic regime gives

us the possibility of estimating the corresponding characteristic time beyond which the asymptotic

distribution P (r) becomes a good approximation of Pk(r). Let T (k) denote the random time at

which a k-th generation aftershock is triggered. It is equal to

T (k) = τ1 + τ2 +

+ τk ,

quantile t(ω, k) of generation k by

[t(ω, k), k] = Pr

Thus, 1

ω is the probability that the duration of any chain of k successive generations of triggered

ω = 0.9), one

may assert that, during the time t(ω, k), all aftershocks of the k-th generation have already been

triggered. Let k = k

The separation by the curve for x/ℓ = 1 into two families has a simple explanation. For x/ℓ

the mother event lies within the spatial domain

of interest and it is thus counted as generation

0. Its immediate aftershocks are most probably adjacent to it and thus have a large probability

to also fall within

. As the number k of generation increases, aftershocks diﬀuse away and are

less and less likely to fall within

. In contrast, for x/ℓ > 1, the mother earthquake falls outside

The ﬁrst generations of aftershocks which are most likely to be nearby the mother earthquake fall

S
(x = 0.8ℓ; 0.6ℓ; 0.4ℓ; 0.2ℓ; 0), the corresponding distributions are close to each other as predicted

in Section V A. When the mother is outside the disk

(x = 1.4ℓ; 1.2ℓ; 1), the distributions diﬀer

from the previous case and are signiﬁcantly smaller. This gives additional support in favor of

the linear approximation (73), which we used in Section V A. More precisely, these properties

VIII. DISCUSSION

We have presented a general formulation in terms of generating functions of the space-time orga-

nization of earthquake sequences, in the framework of general branching processes. We have applied

this approach to the ETAS (Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence) model of triggered seismicity.

In view of the formidable diﬃculty in obtained exact solutions to the nonlinear integral equations

involving the generating functions, we have developed several approximation schemes which have

been tested by comparison with exact numerical calculations. We have used the corresponding

predictions to ﬁt the distribution of seismic rates in four ﬁnite space-time windows in a California

seismic catalog. The space-time windows diﬀer by their time interval going from dt = 1 day to

dt = 1000 days. The ﬁts have been found to account satisfactorily for the empirical observation.

In particular, we have adjusted the parameters of the theory on the largest time window dt = 1000

days and have then used these frozen parameter values in the theory to calculate the distribution

for the smaller time windows. This tests the rigidity of the theory to account simultaneously for

the distributions at diﬀerent time scales. In this process, we have found it necessary to augment the

ETAS model by taking account of the pre-existing frozen heterogeneity of spontaneous earthquake

sources. We have discussed the physical justiﬁcation of this generalization in terms of pre-existing

33

stress and fault networks, which constrain the form of the pre-existing heterogeneity. Our ﬁnd-

ings have also important implications to assess the quality of models developed to forecast future

seismicity, and suggest to re-examine current procedures which assume Poisson statistics in the

construction of likelihood scores.

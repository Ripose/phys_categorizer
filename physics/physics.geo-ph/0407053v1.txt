We propose a “multifractal stress activation” model combining thermally activated rupture and
long memory stress relaxation, which predicts that seismic decay rates after mainshocks follow the
Omori law ∼ 1/tp with exponents p linearly increasing with the magnitude ML of the mainshock and
the inverse temperature. We carefully test this prediction on earthquake sequences in the Southern
California Earthquake catalog: we ﬁnd power law relaxations of seismic sequences triggered by
mainshocks with exponents p increasing with the mainshock magnitude by approximately 0.1 − 0.15
for each magnitude unit increase, from p(ML = 3) ≈ 0.6 to p(ML = 7) ≈ 1.1, in good agreement
with the prediction of the multifractal model.

Parisi and Frisch [1] and Halsey et al.

[2] have intro-
duced the extended concept of scale invariance, called
multifractality, motivated by hydrodynamic turbulence
and fractal growth aggregates respectively. Use of the
multifractal spectrum as a metric to characterize com-
plex systems is now routinely used in many ﬁelds, in-
cluding seismology to describe the hierarchical structure
in space and time of earthquakes and faults (see for in-
stance [3, 4, 5]). However, the origin of multifractal-
ity is rarely identiﬁed. This is certainly true for earth-
quakes for which the possible existence of multifractal-
ity is under scrutiny due to limited and corrupted data
sets leading to biases [6] and its origin a matter of de-
bate: fractal growth processes [7], self-organized critical-
ity [4] or hierarchical cascades of stresses [8] are among
the physical scenarios proposed to lead to multifractal-
ity in fault and earthquake patterns. Here, we propose a
physically-based “multifractal stress activation” model of
earthquake interaction and triggering based on two sim-
ple ingredients: (i) a seismic rupture results from ther-
mally activated processes giving an exponential depen-
dence on the local stress; (ii) the stress relaxation has a
long memory. The interplay between these two physical
processes are shown to lead to a multifractal organization
of seismicity, which we observe quantitatively in real cat-
alogs.

Thermal activation is relevant in all previously pro-
posed physical processes underlying earthquakes: creep
rupture, stress corrosion and state-and-velocity depen-
dent friction. We model seismic activity λ(~r, t) at po-
sition ~r and time t as the occurence of frictional slid-
ing events and/or fault ruptures that are thermally ac-
tivated processes facilitated by the applied stress ﬁeld:
λ(~r, t) ∼ exp [−βE(~r, t)], where β is the inverse temper-
ature and the energy barrier E(~r, t) for rupture can be
written as the sum of a contribution E0(~r) characterizing
the material and of a term linearly decreasing with the

locally applied stress Σ(~r, t): E(~r, t) = E0(~r) − V Σ(~r, t).
V is a constant which has the dimension of a volume and
Σ(~r, t) is the total stress at position ~r and time t. The
decrease of the energy barrier E(~r, t) as a function of the
applied stress Σ(~r, t) embodies the various physical pro-
cesses aiding rupture activation under stress. In addition,
there are many evidences for a stress-controlled earth-
quake activation process, suggesting that earthquakes
trigger earthquakes directly and indirectly via dynami-
cal and static stress transfers. Visco-elastic models of
stress relaxation can account for the short-term relax-
ation processes of the strain measured by geodetic meth-
ods but, over long time scales, it is necessary to take
into account the presence and geometry of lower crustal
and mantle shear zones, which lead to slower decay-
ing relaxation rates. We thus write the stress Σ(~r, t)
at position ~r and time t as the sum of contributions
from all past events at earlier times τ < t and posi-
tions ~r ′: Σ(~r, t) = Σfar ﬁeld(~r, t) +
dN [d~r ′ ×
dτ ]∆σ(~r ′, τ )g(~r −~r ′, t− τ ). A given past event at (~r ′, τ )
contributes to the stress at (~r, t) by its stress drop am-
plitude ∆σ(~r ′, τ ) which is transfered in space and time
via the stress kernel (or Green function) g(~r − ~r′, t − τ ),
taking into account both time relaxation and spatial ge-
ometrical decay. The term dN [d~r ′ × dτ ] is the number
of events in the volume d~r ′ that occurred between τ and
τ + dτ .

In this letter, we restrict our analysis to the time do-

triggering by other earthquakes and accounts for the tec-
tonic loading (far ﬁeld stress), which may in general be
non-homogeneous in space and perhaps depends on time.
Since expression (1) is deﬁned for any ~r, we drop the ref-
erence to ~r without loss of generality.

To go further, we specify the distribution P (s) of
stress sources and the memory kernel h(t). On the ba-
sis of theoretical calculations, simulations and measure-
ments of rotations of earthquake focal mechanisms, Ka-
gan [9] has suggested that P (s) should follow a symmetric
Cauchy distribution. To capture in a phenomenological
way the extended nature and complexity of earthquake
ruptures, we use a more general power law distribution
P (s) ∼ C/|∆s|1+µ, which generalizes the Cauchy case
µ = 1. To account for the slower-than-exponential stress
relaxation processes discussed above, we postulate that
h(t) = c1+θ
(t+c)1+θ for 0 < t ≤ T , which is of the Omori
form with the usual small time-scale cut-oﬀ c. To ensure
convergence of the correlation function of deterministic
processes with memory governed by h(t) for any possible
values of θ, we truncate the power law at some large time
T , which we call the “integral time scale:” it is the largest
time scale up to which the memory of a past event sur-
vives. T can thus be interpreted as the eﬀective Maxwell
time of the relaxation process. The time dependence of
h(t) is an eﬀective description of the relaxation of stress
due to microscopic processes such as dislocation motion,
stress corrosion and hydrolytic weakening which obeys
an Omori-like power law.

In summary, our model reads (in discretized form)

λ(t) = λtec eβω(t) , ω(t) =

s(ti) h(t − ti)

(2)

Xi | ti≤t

with the stress sources s(ti) distributed according to a
power law P (s) with exponent µ and h(t) having a power
law memory.

We now derive our novel prediction for Omori’s law
quantifying the decay of seismic activity after a “main-
shock” occurring at the origin of time. This amounts to
determining the typical time dependence of the seismic
rate λ(t) conditioned on a value λM realized at t = 0
which is larger than average. This formulation is due to
the fact that a mainshock of magnitude M induces a local
burst of seismic activity proportional to K 10αM , where
K and α are two positive constants [10]. Since the stress
sources are non-Gaussian but power law distributed,
their average and variance may not be deﬁned. Rather
than calculating the conditional expectation of λ(t), a
typical measure of conditional seismicity rate can be de-
ﬁned at any quantile level q by the probability Pr[λ(t) >
λq|λM ] that the rate λ(t) be larger than the quantile
λq conditioned on the fact that the seismic rate was at
some given value λM at time 0: Pr[λ(t) > λq|λM ] =
Pr[eβω(t) > λq

where E[ω(t)|ωM ] = ωM
. Using (2), this
would provide a closed formed expression for the Omori
law describing the relaxation of the conditional rate
E[λ(t)|λM ]. The physical meaning of this result is that
one can write a linear regression ω(t) = γ(t)ωM +ǫ, where
γ(t) is a non-random factor and ǫ is a centered Gaus-
sian noise with zero correlation with ωM . This equation
writes that the best predictor of ω given ωM is γωM , i.e.,
E[ω(t)|ωM ] = γωM with γ = Cov[ω(t),ωM ]
. For power law
stress sources, we use the insight that the natural gener-
alization of the variance for power laws p(x) ≈ C/x1+µ
with inﬁnite variance (i.e., with µ < 2) is the scale pa-
rameter C (see Chap. 4 of [11]). In the power law case,
due to the linear form of ω in (2), we can still write
ω(t) = γ(t)ωM + ǫ but with ω(t), ωM and ǫ being power
law distributed random variables with the same expo-
nent µ and with scale factors equal respectively to Cω
(for ω and ωM ) and Cǫ. The key idea is that γ can
be determined by forming the random variable deﬁned
as the product ωωM = γω2
It is straightfor-
ward to show that the distribution of ωωM consists of
two main contributions, (i) a dominant power law with
exponent µ/2 and scale factor CωωM = γµ/2 Cω, and
(ii) a sub-dominant power law with exponent µ (with
a logarithmic correction) and scale factor CωCǫ. This
has the following practical implication: if one measures
or calculates the leading power law decay of ω × ωM ,
the measure of its scale factor gives access to the pa-

rameter γ through the expression γ(t) = (CωωM /Cω)
where the time dependence of γ(t) comes from that of
CωωM . For µ = 2, we recover the Gaussian result
with the correspondence Cω = Var[ω] and CωωM =
Cov[ω(t), ωM ]. Using (2), we then form the product
j | tj ≤0 s(ti) s(tj) h(t − ti) h(−tj),
ω(t)ωM =
where the s’s are random variables with power law tail
with exponent µ. Then, using standard calculations (see
Chap. 4 of [11]), the terms in the double sum that con-
tribute to the leading asymptotic power law tail with ex-
ponent µ/2 correspond to the diagonal terms i = j, while
all the other terms contribute to the sub-leading power
law tail with exponent µ with logarithmic corrections.
This gives the expression of the scale factor C{µ/2}
ωωM of
the dominating power law with exponent µ/2 and ﬁnally

time step ∆t converting the discrete into the continu-

We thus obtain Pr[ω(t) > y|ωM ] = Pr[γωM + ǫ >
y|ωM ] = Pr[ǫ > y − γωM |ωM ] = ¯F (y − γ(t)ωM ),
where ¯F (ǫ) is the complementary cumulative distribu-
tion of ǫ. Putting these results in (2), this leads to
Pr[λ(t) > λq|λM ] = ¯F
. The

tioned on the rate λM at time 0 is thus given by ﬁxing the

too large t’s and for constant1 < constant2, gives γ(t) ≈

2 × ln(t/T ). This yields (5). Typi-
cally, the power law behavior is observed over more than
two decades in time, which is comparable to empirical
observations, as veriﬁed by direct numerical integration
of (3). Then, expression (4) leads to (5) using the fact
that ωM ∝ ln(λM ) ∝ ln(K 10αM ) = α ln 10 M + ln K,
i.e., ωM is linearly related to the magnitude M . The fact
that γ(t) is asymptotically exactly logarithmic in time
for 2m = µ(1 + θ) = 1 and thus that the seismic rate
λ(t) is an Omori power law can be recovered from a dif-
ferent construction motivated by multiplicative cascades
introduced in turbulence [12]. This case covers the exact
multifractal random walk model [13], which corresponds
asymtotically to θ = −1/2 and µ = 2. This continu-
ous dependence of the exponent p(M ) has actually been
documented empirically in this case in another context
of aftershock decay following shocks in ﬁnancial markets
[14]. For 2m = µ(1 + θ) 6= 1, one can often observe an
approximate linear decay of γ(t) as a function of ln t, over
two to three order of magnitudes in time in the decaying
part, all the more so, the closer m is to 1/2, also leading
to (5).

We now show that this prediction is veriﬁed in
the Southern Californian earthquakes catalog with re-
vised magnitudes (available from the Southern California
Earthquake Center). The details of our analysis is given
elsewhere [15] and we summarize the main results.
In
order to improve the statistical signiﬁcance and to test

for the stability of our analysis, we analyzed four diﬀer-
ent sub-catalogs: 1932 − 2003 for magnitude ML > 3
(17, 934 events), 1975 − 2003 for ML > 2.5 (36, 614
events), 1992 − 2003 for ML > 2 (54, 990 events), and
1994 − 2003 for ML > 1.5 (86, 228 events). We consider
all events in a given sub-catalog and discriminate between
mainshocks and triggered events (“aftershocks”). Main-
shocks are determined by using two diﬀerent decluster-
ing methods described below. Once the mainshocks are
determined, triggered events are deﬁned as those events
following a mainshock, which belong to a certain space-
time neighborhood of it. In order to test for the predicted
dependence of the p-value as a function of magnitude,
we bin the mainshock magnitudes in intervals [1.5; 2],
[2; 2.5], [2.5; 3], and so on up to [7; 7.5]. In each main-
shock magnitude interval [M1; M2], we consider all trig-
gered sequences emanating from mainshocks with mag-
nitude in this interval and stacked them to a common
origin of time. The resulting function is ﬁtted using the
modiﬁed Omori law N (t) = B + a
(t+c)p , where B is a
positive parameter introduced to account for the back-
ground seismicity assumed to be superimposed over the
genuine triggered sequences. The time shift c ensures the
regularization of the seismic rate at t = 0.

The ﬁrst declustering method is essentially the same
as deﬁned in [10]: every event in the catalog is deﬁned as
a mainshock if it has not been preceded by an event with
larger magnitude within a ﬁxed space-time window T ×d,
with T = 1 year and d = 50 km. Looking for events trig-
gered by this mainshock, we deﬁne another space-time
window following it. The time dimension of the window
is also set to 1 year, whereas the space dimension depends
on the rupture length of the main event. This spatial win-
dow is chosen as a circle of radius equal to the mainshock
rupture length L = 10−2.57+0.6ML, which is the average
relationship between L and magnitude ML for California
[16]. If any event falls within this space-time window, it
is considered as triggered by the main event. We have
also checked the stability of the results by considering a
spatial neighborhood of radius 2L rather than L for the
triggered events. The second declustering method is the
same as the ﬁrst one, except for one element: the space
window used for qualifying a mainshock is not ﬁxed to
d = 50km but is chosen to adapt to the size of the rupture
lengths L(Mi) given by L = 10−2.57+0.6ML of all events
of all possible magnitudes ML(i) preceding this potential
mainshock.

Figure 1 shows sets of typical seismic decay rates of
stacked sequences for several magnitude intervals of the
mainshocks, for the period from 1932 to 2003 when using
the ﬁrst declustering technique, with mainshock magni-
tudes above ML = 1.5. Very similar plots are obtained
for diﬀerent time periods, with the second declustering
method and by varying the size from L to 2L of the spa-
tial domain over which the triggered sequences are se-
lected [15]. For large mainshock magnitudes, the roll-oﬀ

FIG. 2: p-values of the Omori law ∼ 1/tp obtained by the
procedure described in the text for mainshocks (deﬁned using
the second declustering algorithm) as a function of the main
events’ magnitude, for the diﬀerent sub-catalogs of lifespans
given in the inset.

Figure 2 shows the ﬁtted p-values as a function of the
magnitude of the mainshocks for each of the four sub-
catalogs. We use a standard least-square ﬁt of the seismic
rate as a function of time with a weight proportional to t
for each bin to balance their relative importance. We also
take into account the possible presence of a background
term. We have also performed maximum likelihood esti-
mations of the exponent p, conﬁrming the results shown
in Fig. 2 [15]. To test the reliability and robustness of
our results, we have simulated synthetic catalogs with the
ETAS model with known statistical properties following
exactly the same procedure as for the real catalogs. The

4

ETAS model provides a particular strong null hypothesis
as it rationalizes most of the phenomenological statisti-
cal properties of earthquake catalogs [17]. By construc-
tion, synthetic catalogs generated with the ETAS model
should exhibit Omori laws with magnitude-independent
exponents. Applying our procedure to such synthetic
catalogs allows us to investigate whether the magnitude-
dependence of the p-value reported above could result
from some bias introduced by our analysis rather than
being a genuine property of earthquake catalogs. We
verify that p(M ) obtained by our procedure is a con-
stant independent of M equal to the input value used in
the generation of the synthetic catalog [15].

Let us conclude by oﬀering an intuitive explanation
of (5) using the properties of multifractal spectra. The
temporal evolution of seismicity in a ﬁxed spatial domain
deﬁnes a statistically stationary measure on the tempo-
ral axis, the measure determining the rate of earthquakes
at any possible instant. An Omori sequence with expo-
nent p corresponds to a singularity (to the right) equal to
1 − p (logarithmic for p = 1). A large earthquake triggers
a strong burst of seismicity, giving rise to a strong singu-
larity. For the relation α = 1 − p to be consistent with
the multifractal description, a large earthquake must be
associated with a strong singularity, a small α, hence a
large p. Reciprocally, small moment orders q select weak
seismic sequences, which are thus associated with small
local mainshocks. Small q’s are associated with large α’s,
hence small p’s. By a similar argument in the space do-
main, the exponent of the spatial decay of the seismic
rate induced by a mainshock of magnitude ML should
increase with ML. Thus, in this view, the ETAS model
is nothing but the mono-fractal approximation of a more
general multifractal description of seismicity.

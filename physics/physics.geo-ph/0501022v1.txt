(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Numerical simulations of the collapse and spreading of granular columns onto an horizontal plane
using the Contact Dynamics method are presented. The ﬁnal shape of the deposit seems to depend
only on the aspect ratio a of the columns; these results are in good agreement with previous experi-
mental work. In particular, the renormalised runout distance shows a power law dependence on the
aspect ratio a, which is incompatible with a simple friction model. The dynamics of the collapse is
shown to be mostly controlled by the free fall of the column. The energy dissipation at the base of
the column can be described simply by a coeﬃcient of restitution. Hence the energy available for
the sideways ﬂow is proportional to the initial potential energy E0. The dissipation process within
the ﬂow is well approximated by basal friction, contrary to the behaviour of the runout distance.
The mass ejected sideways is showned to play a determining role in the spreading process. As a
increases, the same fraction of initial potential energy E0 drives more mass against friction. This
additional dissipation give a possible explanation for power-law dependence of the runout distance
on a. Beyond the frictional properties of the material, we show that the ﬂow characteristics strongly
depend on the early dynamics of the collapse. We propose a new scaling for the runout distance that
matches the data well, is compatible with a friction model, and provide a qualitative explanation to
the column collapse phenomenology.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Although they have been a central subject in recent
research, granular ﬂows remain intriguing in many
aspects of their behaviour [see 4, 16]. The understanding
of such ﬂows has obvious application in industrial
processes, which often handle all kinds of powders and
granules. But it is also crucial in the geophysical issue
landslides or
of catastrophic ﬂows. Rock avalanches,
pyroclastic ﬂows all involve a granular solid phase, the
inﬂuence of which can become momentous on the mean
behaviour of the ﬂow.
In the absence of a clear physical background for the
modelling of these large scale natural granular ﬂows,
their characterisation mainly relies on the observation
of the ﬁnal deposits, and in particular, of the ﬁnal
runout distance [see 3, 5]. A simple eﬀective basal
friction µe is often advocated as the most convenient
description of the dissipation process. This allows for
a in-situ quantiﬁcation of the mobility of the ﬂow,
knowing the runout distance and the initial height of the
material. Moreover, basal friction is easily incorporated
in continuous modelling, like shallow water equations for
instance [see 7, 12, 17]. However, the dependence of this
eﬀective friction on the nature of the material, on the
characteristics of the collapse or on the dynamics of the
ﬂow, has yet to be speciﬁed.

Systematic studies of the frictional properties and the
spreading of granular ﬂows on incline planes have been
carried out [see 14, 15]. However, until late, the simple
case of a granular mass collapsing onto an horizontal
plane had not been addressed. Recently, experimental
works have tackled this problem, and studied the

collapse and spreading of a suddenly released column of
grains onto an horizontal plane [see 1, 8, 10]. Essentially,
the eﬀect of the initial geometry of the column on the
geometry of the ﬁnal deposit has been investigated.
The main result consists in scaling laws for the runout
distance.
In particular, when the initial aspect ratio
of the collapsing column is high enough, the runout
distance renormalised by the initial radius of the column
shows a power law dependence on the initial aspect
ratio. Moreover, this dependence varies depending on
the conditions of the experiment, and in particular
between the axisymmetric or quasi 2D conﬁgurations.
Although simple models relying on Coulomb failure
analysis or on shallow water approximation for the ﬂow
have been proposed, no clear physical understanding
of the granular collapse process has been achieved yet.
In particular, the scaling laws obtained for the runout
distance are incompatible with a simple basal friction
model, and question the mode of energy dissipation
occurring in the successive steps of the collapse dynamics.

In this context, the use of the numerical simulation to
reproduce numerically the collapse of granular columns
is expected to give new interesting insights in the prob-
lem.
Indeed, Discrete Element Methods allow for the
simulation of each grain forming the granular mass, giv-
ing access to each grain’s trajectory. We can thus hope
to access a picture of the collapse phenomena otherwise
very diﬃcult to obtain from experimental setup.
The aim of the present work is to determine which are the
mechanisms controlling the spreading dynamics: fall of
the column, dissipation at the base, ejection of mass side-
ways and dissipation within the ﬂow. Therefore, we have
applied the Contact Dynamics algorithm [see 6, 13] in two
dimensions. The numerical procedures are explained in

section II. After brieﬂy recalling and commenting the ex-
perimental results obtained by other authors [see 1, 8, 10]
in section III, the diﬀerent regimes of spreading are quali-
tatively described and scaling laws are established in sec-
tion IV. We observe a very good agreement between the
experiments and the simulations. Details of the dynam-
ics of the vertical fall and of the sideways spreading are
shown in section V. The dissipation of energy, and the
transfer of energy from vertical fall to horizontal motion,
are examined in section VI. We show that the amount
of energy available for the spreading is simply propor-
tional to the initial potential energy of the column and
that basal friction is a very good approximation of the
dissipation within the sideways ﬂow. Eventually, we con-
clude that the ability of the column to eject the grains
sideways is a major aspect of the dynamics. This leads
us to question the scaling laws obtained for the runout
distance as perhaps fortuitous and corresponding to a
transient regime. A new empirical ﬁt, compatible with
a friction law, and qualitatively describing the collapse
phenomenology, is proposed in section VII. Summary of
the results and further discussion are presented in sec-
tion VIII.

II. NUMERICAL PROCEDURES

A. Simulation Method

The numerical methods used for the simulation of
granular material are known under the generic name
of Discrete Element Methods. They take into account
the individual existence of each discrete grain forming
the media, and most usually neglect the role of the
interstitial ﬂuid ﬁlling the space between the grains.
Such an approximation makes DEM methods mostly
appropriate for the modelling of dry granular matter. In
the absence of any dynamics induced by the surrounding
ﬂuid (the air in the present case), the behaviour of
the collection of grains is entirely driven by the usual
equations of motion, and the contact laws ruling the
collisions between the grains.

The modelling of the contact phenomena consists in
a set of relations between the contact force and various
quantities referring to the physical and/or chemical pro-
cesses taking place at the surface of the two bodies in
contact. These microscopic interactions can be of dif-
ferent natures. They can involve for instance elastic or
plastic deformation of asperities, adhesion due to Van der
Waals forces, aging process... In any case, the complex-
ity of these phenomena cannot be directly incorporated
in the contact models, ﬁrst due to practical reasons of
numerical feasibility or eﬃcacy, and then, because such
complex models are nevertheless not assured to be re-
alistic. Basically, DEM methods assume small elastic
deformations, with possible viscous eﬀects, and frictional
dissipation as contact phenomenology [2].

2

It is beyond the scope of this paper to give a detailed
account of the numerical method used, and further infor-
mations will be found in dedicated work. Hence we will
just specify the main hypothesis ruling the behaviour of
the numerical grains. In the absence of a clear physical
background for the modelling of contact phenomena, a
possible strategy is to assume that grains are interacting
through hard-core repulsion and non-smooth Coulombic
friction only. This modelling choice is adopted in Con-
tact Dynamics (CD) algorithm [see 6, 13] that we have
applied for the present work. This implies that two grains
have to touch for the contact force to be non-zero, and
no distance interaction is permitted. Once a contact is
formed between two grains, the latter cannot get closer,
and any normal relative motion is repulsive: the grains
are perfectly rigid. The microscopic coeﬃcient of friction
µ characterizes the Coulombic friction threshold ±µN ,
where N is the normal force at contact, and controls the
friction dissipation process at grain scale. The tangential
force T between two grains in contact can either be below
the Coulombic friction threshold, and in that case no tan-
gential slip motion is possible, or it can be exactly equal
to the Coulombic friction threshold, and in that case, slip
motion will dissipate energy. These contact laws allow for
the modelling of multiple collisions between the grains,
namely the fact that the grains are in contact with one
or more neighbours while they are undergoing collisions
with other grains. However, the simple case of a binary
collision is also perfectly described. A Newtonian coef-
ﬁcient of restitution ρ is introduced, which controls the
velocity of the grains after the collision knowing the ve-
locity before the collision. This coeﬃcient of restitution
also appears in the prediction of the velocity of all the
grains in the solving process.
These contact laws are simplistic with regards to the mi-
croscopic reality of contact phenomena. Nevertheless,
they are suﬃcient ingredients to reproduce the collective
dynamics of a collection of grains.

B. Numerical Experiments

Using the CD method, we have simulated two-
dimensional collections of non-adhesive rigid circular
grains. The diameter d of the grains is uniformly
distributed in a small interval such as dmin/dmax = 2/3.
This slight polydispersity of grains size is chieﬂy intro-
duced to break any crystal like ordering of the grains
which may have a non-negligible eﬀect in 2D simulations.
In the following, d denotes the mean grains diameter.
The coeﬃcient of restitution ρ at collision is the same
between all the grains and between the grains and the
bottom plane, and was chosen ρ = 0.5. As well, the
microscopic coeﬃcient of
friction is the same at all
contacts and equals µ = 1.

The numerical experiment consists in releasing a col-
umn of grains in the gravity ﬁeld onto a ﬂat bottom plane,

3

distance. Using the notation mentioned above (namely
H0 and R0 are the initial height and radius of the column
respectively, a the initial aspect ratio, and H∞ and R∞
are respectively the height of the ﬁnal deposit and the
runout distance), the ﬁrst authors [see 10] ﬁnd:

R∞ − R0
R0

≃

a <
1.24 a,
1.6 a1/2 a >

while Lajeunesse et al [see 8] obtain:

R∞ − R0
R0

≃

a <
1. a,
2. a1/2 a >

∼ 0.74
∼ 0.74.

(cid:26)

(cid:26)

Moreover, quasi-2D experiments were carried out by
Lube et al [see 11] by releasing granular columns conﬁned
between two vertical walls. The following scalings were
thus obtained:

R∞ − R0
R0

≃

a <
1.2 a,
1.9 a2/3 a >

∼ 2.3
∼ 2.3.

(cid:26)

Quasi-2D experiments were also carried out by Balm-
forth & Kerswell [see 1], where the inﬂuence of the gap
between the two vertical walls conﬁning the column col-
lapse is also addressed. The results indicates that the
exponent of the power law is dependent on the size of
the gap:

R∞ − R0
R0

≃

λa0.65 Narrow gap
λa0.9 Large gap

(cid:26)

In these experiments moreover, the prefactor λ varies
depending on the material used, while previous authors
found a mono-valuated prefactor, presumably due to
the narrow range of experimented material in this latter
cases.
However, scalings found for quasi-2D experiments in a
narrow gap conﬁguration give similar results for the two
authors [see 1, 11], giving roughly R∞ − R0R0 ∝ a2/3.

The origin of the exponents is still open to discussion.
No model yet has achieved a comprehensive explanation
of the collapse dynamics. In particular, a simple friction
model cannot account for them. Indeed, supposing that
the initial potential energy of the column is completely
dissipated by the work of the friction forces along the
runout distance leads to:

µem0g(R∞ − R0) = m0gH0,

(R∞ − R0)
R0

∝ a1,

is characterized by its initial radius R0 and it initial height

the runout distance R∞ and the height H∞

and study the collapse and the resulting spreading dy-
namics of the granular mass. The bottom plane in our
experiment is perfectly smooth. Laboratory experiments
carried out on rough or smooth surfaces have shown that
the general behaviour of the mass of grains (in particular
the ﬁnal runout distance) is not aﬀected by the roughness
of the plane, save a slight transformation of the deposit
ﬁnal shape [see 8].
The initial columns are prepared by means of a random
rain of grains between two vertical walls. The compacity
of the packing is c0 ≃ 0.82. The dimensions of the col-
umn are its radius R0 and it height H0, and a = H0/R0
is the initial aspect ratio. At time t = 0, the vertical
walls are instantaneously removed, and the column col-
lapses due to gravity. The dimension of the ﬁnal deposit
are the ﬁnal runout distance R∞, and the ﬁnal height
H∞. The compacity of the ﬁnal deposit is c∞ ≃ 0.78,
namely close to the initial compacity in spite of a slight
loosening of the packing of grains. This successive steps
are illustrated in Figure 1.

We have carried out 25 simulations, with a ranging
between 0.21 and 17, and counting from 1000 to 8000
grains.

III. COMMENTS ON THE EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS

Recently, experiments by Lube et al. [see 10] and La-
jeunesse et al [see 8] have investigated the axisymmetric
collapse of a column of grains onto a ﬂat horizontal plane.
The main result consists in scaling laws for the runout

where m0 is the total mass of grains, and µe is the eﬀec-
tive coeﬃcient of friction (constant by deﬁnition). The
existence of the exponents thus leads to the conclusion

that the dissipation process in the collapsing columns
cannot be simply interpreted as a simple basal friction,
and that the overall dynamics of the spreading might be
more complex than usually postulated.

cone coincides with the grains whose cumulated horizontal

displacement is smaller than 5d, and shows a slope ≃ 35
in
all cases. The scale in the four pictures is the same.

IV. SCALING LAWS FOR THE FINAL
DEPOSIT

A. Qualitative Description

From a simple qualitative observation of the dynamics
of the collapse, two diﬀerent regimes can be distinguished

5

slope = 1

slope = 0.7

depending on the value of the initial aspect ratio a.
In the ﬁrst regime, for small a, the ﬂow simply consists
in the fall of the edges of the initial column. The motion
is propagating from the edges inward, while a slope
progressively builds up, along which the grains eventu-
ally stabilize.
In this regime, only the grains situated
at the sides of the columns fall and ﬂow as a result; by
contrast, the grains situated inside the column have no
motion and play no role at all in the spreading. This
situation is illustrated in Fig 2, where four snapshots
of a collapsing pile with a = 0.37 are displayed. In the
course of time, we have represented in black the grains
the cumulated horizontal displacement of which exceeds
the mean grains diameter d. We observe that a majority
of grains experiences smaller or no displacement at all,
and that the upper surface remains undisturbed in its
larger part.

vertical motion in response to gravity, causing most of
the grains to take part to the overall dynamics. Four
snapshots of the collapse of a column are shown in Fig 3
for a = 9.1. Again, are represented in black the grains
whose cumulated horizontal displacement exceeds d.
Only a small fraction of grains situated in the center of
the column remain undisturbed. When a tends to ∞,
this fraction tends to zero.

An intermediate case between these two regimes is
shown in Fig 4, for a = 0.9; the entire upper surface is
aﬀected by the sideways ﬂow, but a well deﬁned inner
cone remains static. The shape of this inner cone is
likely to be related to the frictional properties of the
material, as suggested by [8].
In Fig 5, ﬁnal deposits
are represented for columns with a = 0.9, a = 0.73,
a = 0.55 and a = 0.37. To make the distinction more
obvious between the ﬂowing region and the static or
creeping inner part of the column, a stronger criterion is
used to distinguish the ﬂowing grains: their cumulated
horizontal displacement must exceed 5d. By this means,
the slope of the inner cone becomes very neat, and allows
for the comparison of the deposits. We observe that the
slope of the inner cone remains nearly constant, namely
around 35◦,
It is very tempting
to assume that this slope reﬂects the packing mean
frictional properties rather than the ﬂow dynamics, and
that the collapse, at least for small values of a, results
from a Coulomb failure as assumed by Lajeunesse in [8].
In this case, assuming an hydrostatic stress gives us
an internal angle of friction ϕ ≃ 20◦ for the packing
of grains, equivalent to a coeﬃcient of friction 0.36.
We note that this value does not compare with the
coeﬃcient of friction acting at contacts between grains
µ = 1, and neither with the eﬀective coeﬃcient of basal
friction later evaluated in section VI. For greater values
of a, the static inner cone is destroyed by the vertical
dynamics of the upper grains and can no longer be

independently of a.

observed in the ﬁnal deposit.

The general observations on the shape of the col-
lapsing columns just exposed are very close to previous
experimental description of the collapse phenomenology.

B. Scaling Laws for the Final Deposit

The shape of the ﬁnal deposit resulting from the col-
lapse and the spreading of the granular column is ﬁrst
characterized by the ﬁnal runout distance R∞. For each
experiment, R∞ is evaluated from the position of the
grains connected to the main mass by at least one con-
tact. In other words, grains ejected from the ﬂow, and
undergoing a solitary trajectory independently of the col-
lective behaviour of the ﬂow, will not be taken into ac-
count. The ﬁnal height of the central conical region H∞
is also evaluated; it corresponds to the highest point of
the deposit. Moreover, we evaluate the mean height of
the deposit H ∞ from the total area covered by the grains.

This last quantity is equivalent to a measure of the ﬁnal
potential energy of the deposit.
The evolution of the distance run by the grains nor-
malised by the initial radius of the column (R∞ −R0)/R0
is plotted in Fig 6 as a function of a. We observe the fol-
lowing dependence:

R∞ − R0
R0

≃

a <
2.5 a,
3.25 a0.7, a >

∼ 2
∼ 2.

(cid:26)

As observed in laboratory experiments, the runout dis-
tance obeys two diﬀerent behaviours depending on the
value of a. For small values of a a linear dependence is ob-
served, while for larger a, the dependence is a power law.
The scalings we obtain are in very good agreement with
the scalings observed from quasi 2D laboratory experi-
ments, for which the exponent observed for large enough
a is 2/3 [see 1, 11], and the transition between the two
behaviours occurs at a = 2.3 [see 11]. The prefactors
2.5 and 3.25 obtained in the numerical experiments are
higher than those observed experimentally by Lube et al,
namely 1.2 and 1.9. This diﬀerence is very likely due
to the respective frictional properties of the material; the
circular shape of the numerical grains is for instance a fac-
tor of mobility. Moreover, the dissipation induced by the
friction with the two vertical walls conﬁning the grains
in quasi-2D conﬁguration is certain to aﬀect the value of
the prefactors.
The normalised ﬁnal height H∞/R0 is plotted against a
in Fig 7; we observe:

H∞
R0

≃

∼ 10.

The 2D laboratory experiments show a similar behaviour
(with an exponent 0.4 [see 11] or 0.5 [see 1]), but no tran-
sition is observed for a ≃ 10.
The increase of the quantity of grains spreading sideways
appears clearly when plotting the mean height of the de-
posit normalized by the initial height H ∞/H0 against the
initial aspect ratio a. From Fig 7 the dependance shows

H ∞

≃

(cid:26)

a <

as can be expected from the scaling of the runout dis-
tance and the mass conservation R∞H ∞ = R0H0. This
relation shows the increasing transfer of potential energy
to sideways spreading motion, and the decrease with a of
the potential energy of the ﬁnal deposit.
As discussed in the introduction, these scaling laws are
incompatible with a simple frictional behaviour which
would bring R∞/R0 ∝ a and H∞/R0 ∝ a−1. A ﬁrst
hypothesis is that the dynamics of the grains at the bot-
tom of the column is responsible for a complex dissipa-
tion process dependent on the initial aspect ratio a. As a
consequence the energy available for the spreading would
also depend on a, and possibly cause the dependance of
(R∞ − R0)/R0 with a to be a power law. This aspect
will be discussed further in section VI.

ratio a, where tf is the time of free fall of the top of the
column and t0 = (2R0/g)1/2.

V. DYNAMICS OF THE COLLAPSE AND
SPREADING

A. The Vertical Fall

The dynamics of the collapse is ﬁrst induced by the
vertical fall of the grains. However, as stressed in sec-
tion IV A, diﬀerent behaviour can be observed depending
on the value of a. Computing the position h of the top of
the column in the course of time, we are able to compare
h with the free fall position given by H0 − 0.5gt2, and to
evaluate the time tf during which the top of the column
is in free fall. The criterion used for the free fall to cease
is |h − (H0 − 0.5gt2)| < d (where d is the mean grains
diameter).
In Fig 8 we have plotted (tf /t0)2 as a function of the as-
pect ratio a, where t0 = (2R0/g)1/2. For small values of
a, the time of free fall tf is nearly zero. However, when
a increases, the following relation is satisﬁed:

s

This means that the top of the column is undergoing
a free fall along a distance of nearly H0 − 2.5R0.
In
other words, columns with a >
∼ 2.5 are subjected to free
fall, while columns with a <
∼ 2.5 are not. We believe
this transition in the vertical dynamics of the column
at a ≃ 2.5 to be at the origin of the transition observed
in the scaling law relating (R∞ − R0)/R0 to a (see
section IV B, Fig 6).

7

0 and H 2

smallest column remains above ≈ 2.5R0. The spreading
at the base should not be aﬀected by the height of the
column above, and the top of the column should no
see the spreading process underneath. Once this limit
height ≈ 2.5R0 is reached, the smallest column will soon
ﬁnish its course, while the higher column will be further
accelerated.
This behaviour is clearly visible in the series of pictures
shown is Fig 9, representing the simultaneous collapse
of two columns with heights H 1
0 respec-
tively, and same initial radius R0. In the second column,
the grains initially situated above the height H 1
0 are rep-
resented in black to allow for the comparison of the two
dynamics. From the beginning until H 1
0 ≃ 2.5R0 (ﬁrst
four pictures from top to bottom), the top of the two
columns remain undisturbed, and the spreading process
occurring at their base is exactly identical. Then, we can
observe, in the respective evolution of the mass of grains
initially situated under the height H 1
0 (represented in
gray), the eﬀect of the fall of additional grains (in black)
over the underlying deposit. In particular, the dynamics
of pushing aside grains that would otherwise remain
in the vicinity of the bottom of the column is obvious.
Eventually, the black grains cover the underlying gray
ones.

B. The Sideways propagation

In the course of time, the sideways ﬂow propagates
outward; we denote r the front position at any time t;
eventually, r reaches the ﬁnal value R∞. The total du-
ration of the collapse at which the sideways propagation
stops and the whole deposit comes to repose is denoted
T∞.
In order to compare the dynamics of the spreading
for diﬀerent values of a, we plot in the same graph in
Figure 10 the evolution of the front position normalised
by the ﬁnal runout distance (r − R0)/R∞ as a function
of the time normalised by the total duration of the
propagation t/T∞, for a = 0.9, a = 1.8, a = 3.1, a = 7.7,
a = 10.7 and a = 15.7. The plots nicely collapse into a
master curve, showing ﬁrst a period of acceleration of
the front, followed by a constant propagation regime,
and then a deceleration period.

From the initial geometry of the column two character-
istic times t0 = (2R0/g)1/2 and T0 = (2H0/g)1/2 can be
formed, corresponding to the time of free fall along the
distance R0 and H0 respectively. The collapse duration
T∞ is plotted against T0 in graph 11. We observe a linear
relation

The eight top pictures show the indiﬀerence of the spreading
on the height of the columns during the free fall dynamics.
The eight bottom pictures show how the additional material
(in black) pushes aside and eventually covers the underlying
material (in gray).

The fact that the top of the column is in free fall
entails that the upper part of the column is not aﬀected
by the complex spreading process going on at the
bottom. As a consequence, two columns with the same
initial radius R0, but two diﬀerent initial heights H 1

which the duration of the experiments is found to be
nearly 3T0 [see 11].

The period of acceleration of the propagation front is
well characterized when plotting for diﬀerent values of a
the normalised front position (r − R0)/R0 as a function
of the renormalised time t/t0 (Fig 12). For high values of
a, we clearly distinguish the acceleration phase followed
by a constant velocity propagation phase. This evolution
is not so obvious for small values of a, for which the de-
celeration phase occurs early and leaves less time for a
constant velocity regime to settle.
When plotting (r − R0)/R0 against a in a log-log repre-
sentation, we see, up to t/t0 ≃ 1.5, and for a >
∼ 1.8, that

Although this approximation is made over a very short
time interval, it suggests that the onset of the spreading
is driven by the free fall dynamics.

Where a constant velocity regime can be observed, the

following relation is satisﬁed:

where v0 = (2gR0)1/2 is the front propagation velocity,
once a constant velocity regime is settled, after the front
position has already run a distance 2R0.

Since the column is undergoing a free fall for a >
∼ 2,
the cumulated mass of grains m(t) expelled as a result
of the collapse is given by m(t) ∝ ρsR0gt2, where ρs is
the surfacic mass of the grains packing. As the greater
part of the front propagation involves a constant veloc-
ity, r ≃ v0t, the increasing mass debit at the bottom of
the column can only be accommodated by an increase
of the height of the sideways ﬂow. Moreover, the grains
reaching the bottom, after they have been accelerated
in the gravity ﬁeld, have a greater momentum than the
grains preceeding them. This eﬀect is responsible for the
existence of a wave propagating outwards and transfer-
ring the mass from the center towards the margin of the
spreading for high values of a. An extreme case of this
“mass propagation” phenomena is illustrated in Fig 14
where the sideways ﬂow is represented for a = 70.

This eﬀect is more important in 2D conﬁgurations than
in axisymmetric ones, for which the increase of the sur-
face available for the spreading is quadratic with the
front propagation, while the front propagation has been
shown to obey the same behaviour r = v0t [see 8]. This
suggests a purely geometrical explanation of the diﬀer-
ence observed in the scaling laws in axisymmetric and

straightforward scaling law:
p
(R∞ − R0) = v0T0 = (H0R0)1/2,

corresponding to the observation (R∞ − R0)/R0 ≃ a1/2
in axisymmetric collapses. The diﬀerence with the 2D
case (namely (R∞ − R0)/R0 ≃ a2/3) could be due to
the larger increase of mass with important momentum
in the sideways ﬂow, whose eﬀect would be to lengthen
the deceleration phase. The contribution of the decel-
eration phase to the runout distance is non-negligible in
2D. Three examples of the contribution of the decelera-
tion phase to the ﬁnal runout distance are displayed in
Figure 13; up to one third of the total runout distance is
gained during the deceleration. This eﬀect is presumably
more important than in axisymmetric conﬁguration, for

the expanding surface of the ﬂow. This could explain the
diﬀerence of the exponents (1/2 in axisymmetric and 2/3
in 2D) in the scaling laws. A systematic analysis of the
deceleration phase should help to solve this issue; it is
however not undertaken in the present paper.

VI. ENERGY TRANSFER AND DISSIPATION

A. Time evolution

Basically, three successive stages can be identiﬁed in
the history of a grain falling within the column. In a ﬁrst
step, its initial potential energy is converted into vertical
motion, and if the initial height of the grain allows for
it, it will be accelerated down to the bottom. There, in
a second step, the grain will undergo collisions with the
bottom plane or the surrounding grains, and its vertical
In a
motion will be converted into horizontal motion.
third step, the grain eventually leaves the column base
area and ﬂow sideways. Of course, this process involves
a collective dynamics of collisions and momentum lost
and transfer, whose complexity makes any prediction
of the trajectory of any grain dubious. For the same
reason, a high initial potential energy is no individual
guaranty, for a single grain, of a long sideways travel.
As an illustration of the complexity of the vertical to
horizontal motion transfer, successive snapshots of the
deformation of a collapsing column with a ≃ 9.1 are
displayed in Fig 15. The grains initially situated at the
margins of the column, in the central area, and at the

top, are represented in black.
In the course of time
we observe that the grains traveling farther are not
those initially at the top. On the contrary, grains which
were at middle height or even lower are nearer to the
spreading front area. This behaviour is also visible in
the deformation of the inner black slice.

The conversion of momentum from vertical to hori-
zontal direction is likely to depend on the value of a. In
Fig 16, we have represented for two collapsing columns
with a = 2.6 and a = 15.7, the time evolution of the
potential energy Ep, the vertical kinetic energy Eky and
the horizontal kinetic energy Ekx normalised by the ini-
tial potential energy E0, with

where i = {x, y}, Np is the total number of grains, mp

From these graphs we ﬁrst see that a higher proportion
of the initial energy is dissipated by the column with
a = 15.7, in agreement with the scaling of H∞/H0 in
Figure 7, which is equivalent to the scaling of the ﬁnal
potential energy to the initial potential energy. Then, we
observe that the conversion of energy from potential to
kinetic in the vertical direction is much more eﬃcient for
a = 15.7. By contrast, a greater proportion of vertical
kinetic energy is transferred into the horizontal direction
for a = 2.6. This suggests that the ability of the column
to use its initial energy for spreading might depend on a.

B. Conversion from Potential to Kinetic Energy

For each value of a, we compute the kinetic energy
of the system averaged over the total duration of the
collapse T∞ in the vertical and horizontal direction:

For high values of the aspect ratio a (or for k = 0), the
mean vertical kinetic energy is bounded by 4/15. For
intermediate values of a, hEky i is expected to obey the
relation 3 with k = 2.5. The mean vertical kinetic energy
hEky i renormalised by the initial energy E0 is plotted in
Fig 17 as a function of a. In the same graph is plotted
the prediction g(a) = (1 − 2.5/a)(4/15 + 2/5 × 2.5/a)
from the relation 3. We observe that the simulations
points and the prediction are very unlike, presumably
because of the collective dynamics of the grains reaching
the bottom of the column. However, following the pre-
diction, the evolution of the mean vertical kinetic energy
shows an increase (though much slower than would be
expected) towards the limit value 4/15, which appears in
the following approximation of hEky i:

We deﬁne the coeﬃcient of restitution ρy characteris-
ing the transfer of potential energy into vertical motion,
so that

hEky i = ρyE0,
where ρy = 4/15(1 − a−0.022) is an increasing function of
a. For a → ∞, ρy → 4/15, namely the potential energy
is converted into vertical motion following the ideal free
fall case. For smaller values of a however, there exists a
transient regime during which the vertical kinetic energy
increases with a.
Similar transient behaviour in the
dynamics of the sideways ﬂow is discussed in next section.

The horizontal kinetic energy hEkx i, normalised by E0,

is plotted in Fig 18 as a function of a. We observe

for a >
∼ 2.5. As preceedently we deﬁne the coeﬃcient
of restitution ρx characterising the transfer of potential
energy into horizontal motion:

hEkx i
E0

≃ 0.16,

hEkx i = ρxE0,

with ρx = 0.16. Surprisingly, in spite of the complex-
ity of the process taking place at the bottom of the col-
umn, the energy available for the horizontal motion is
simply proportional to the initial potential energy, and
only implies the introduction of a constant eﬀective co-
eﬃcient of restitution. Hence we can no longer sus-
pect the dissipation process at the bottom of the col-
umn to be at the origin of the divergence with the sim-
ple friction model described in equation 2. We have

seen in section III that the scaling laws implied that
the relation m0gH0 = µem0gR∞ is not satisﬁed. Since
hEkx i = ρxE0, we cannot have hEkx i = µem0gR∞ either,
which would lead to R∞ = 0.16/µeH0. We may thus sup-
pose that the assumption of a basal friction controlling
the energy dissipation in the sideways ﬂow is wrong. This
aspect is tackled in the next section.
Computing Eky,max and Ekx,max the maximum kinetic
energy in the vertical and horizontal direction during the
collapse, the evolution of these two quantities as a func-
tion of a is similar to the evolution of the corresponding
mean quantities observed in Figure 17 and 18. The max-
imum values are about three times the mean values, as
could be expected from the time evolution of Eky and
Ekx shown in Figure 16.

Characterizing the ability of the columns to convert
vertical kinetic energy into horizontal kinetic energy by
the ratio ρx/ρy, we obtain a decreasing function of the
aspect ratio tending towards ρx, suggesting again the ex-
istence of a transient regime in the dynamics of spreading.

C. Basal Friction

or equivalently,

The basal friction is the dissipation mechanism most
often postulated for the dense ﬂow of model granular me-
dia, and is indeed proven to be a relevant description [see
14, 15]. It implies the deﬁnition of an eﬀective coeﬃcient
of friction µe, which is a mean phenomenological transla-
tion of the more complex dissipation process taking place
at smaller scale through collisions and contact friction.
To check whether basal friction is a satisfactory descrip-
tion of the dissipation occurring within the sideways ﬂow,
we compare the exact amount of energy made available
for the ﬂow with the work done by the mass of grains over
the distance they eventually run. Therefore, we deﬁne
in the collapse two vertical sections S situated at −R0
and R0, and delimiting the initial position of the mass
of grains and the actual horizontal ﬂow, as showned in
Fig 19. Integrating over the total duration of the collapse
T∞, we compute the exact amount of energy ES crossing
the sections S, and thus taking part to the ﬂow, and the
exact mass of grains mS going through S. The energy
ES is computed from both potential and kinetic energies
of the grains. In the case of a simple friction process in
the sideways ﬂow, we should observe, independently of
the dynamics occurring within the interval [−R0, R0],

ES = µemSg(RS − R0),

where RS is the ﬁnal distance run by the mass of grains
mS, and is taken equal to the ﬁnal position of the center
of mass of mS.

The energy ES normalised by the work of the mass
mS over a distance R0 is plotted as a function of the adi-
mensional ﬂowing distance (RS − R0)/R0 in Figure 20a
for all the collapse experiments. We obtain a neat linear
dependance establishing that energy dissipation in the
ﬂow is very well approximated by basal friction. The
value of the eﬀective coeﬃcient of friction µe is given
by the slope of the linear relation and is found to be
µe ≃ 0.47.

If we assume that all the grains travel the ﬁnal runout
distance R∞ − R0, we again obtain a linear dependence,
as seen in Figure 20b, but with a much smaller eﬀective
coeﬃcient of friction µe ≃ 0.16 expressing the maximum
mobility of the ﬂow. In any case, the following relation
is veriﬁed:

ES = µemSg(R∞ − R0).

(4)

In Figure 21a, the plot of ES/E0 as a function of a
shows that as soon as a >
∼ 3, ES/E0 ≃ 0.44. As could be
inferred from the evolution of the mean horizontal energy
(previous section), the energy available for the ﬂow is
simply proportional to the initial potential energy. The
relation 4 can be rewritten:

0.44E0 ≃ µemSg(R∞ − R0),

(5)

12

(6)

∼ 3:

0.44m0gH0 ≃ µemSg(R∞ − R0).

Finally, this leads to the following expression for a >

(R∞ − R0)
R0

∝ a

mS
m0

.

This relation suggests that the disagreement between the
scalings observed experimentally and the simple friction
model (see expression 2) might rest in the deﬁnition of
the mass of grains actually ﬂowing.

The renormalised mass of grains actually crossing the
section S and taking part to the ﬂow mS/m0 is plotted
in Figure 21b as a function of a. There exist a function
f of the aspect ratio such as

mS
m0

≃ 1 − f (a),

with f (a) → 0 when a → ∞. No argument for the empiri-
cal ﬁt f (a) = 4.8(6+a)−1 is proposed; the main point of it
is that it captures a major aspect of the ﬂow phenomenol-
ogy: the ejection of grains sideways. For small values of
a, a small fraction of grains ﬂows sideways, and most of
the mass remains trapped in the interval [−R0, R0], at
the bottom of the initial column. The fraction of ﬂow-
ing grains increases with a. When a becomes high, this
fraction tends towards 1, as can be seen in Fig 14 where
the mass ﬂowing sideways in represented for a = 70. The
increase of the proportion of mass actually taking part to
the ﬂow can be related to the increase of vertical kinetic
energy relatively to the initial energy (see Fig 17).
The increase of mass ﬂowing sideways causes the friction
dissipation process to be more eﬃcient; while a increases,
the same fraction of initial potential energy E0 is driving
more mass against friction. This additional dissipation
may well explain why an exponent lower than 1 appears
in the scaling law.
This progressive increase of the ﬂowing mass, bounded
by the initial mass m0, also suggests that the dynamics
of the collapse, in the range of a experimentally investi-
gated, is transient.

VII. NEW SCALINGS FOR A TRANSIENT
REGIME

In the range of aspect ratios a investigated in this
present work, as well as in preceedent experimental
work [see 1, 8, 10], the collapses of the columns mainly
diﬀer in the mass of grains ejected sideways. The higher
the value of a, the greater the proportion of grains
ejected. Because of this diﬀerence, the propagating ﬂows
do not involve the same proportion of the initial mass of
grains. For increasing values of a, the increase of mass
will cause the work done by the ﬂow to be more eﬃcient,
aﬀecting thus the runout distance.

the renormalised runout distance of the ﬂow (R∞ − R0)/R0
(graph b)

However, the mass of grains ﬂowing tends towards the
initial mass m0 when a increases, so we anticipate the
dependance of the dissipation process on a to vanish. In
this limit, the amount of energy dissipated by the ﬂow
would only be dependent on the runout distance.
The dependance of the proportion of mass actually ﬂow-
ing mS/m0 on a shown in Figure 21b reﬂects this be-
haviour and the asymptotic evolution towards a new
regime. However the scaling laws displayed in Figure 6
and Figure 7 do not at all express the existence of this
transition.
On the basis of our observations of the phenomenology of
the sideways ﬂow, we can thus suggest that there exists
a function f (a), verifying f (a) → 0 when a → ∞, such

We have represented in Figure 22 the evolution of

3.25a0.7, and the empirical ﬁt a/(1 − f (a)), where
f (a) = 4.8(6 + a)−1 describes the grains ejection process
(see section above). We observe that in the range of
aspect ratios investigated, the last choice is as acceptable
as a power-law dependence.

No argument on the form of the function f (a) will be
discussed at this stage. Basically, it represents the ad-
ditional dissipation entailed by the increase of the pro-
portion of mass ﬂowing, while the proportion of energy
available for the ﬂow is constant (at least for a >
∼ 3 in our
simulations). The choice of an approximation of the form
a/(1−f (a)) for the runout distance has two implications:

1. For large a, the runout distance will eventually in-
crease like the height of the column, as expected in
a simple friction dynamics.

2. It suggests that the power-law dependance might

be fortuitous.

In the absence of a comprehensive model explaining
either one or the other approximation, the proposition
discussed here remains purely speculative. However, it
matches nicely the numerical results, and provides a qual-
itative explanation for the non linear behaviour of the
runout distance with a. Finally, it suggests that the key

point of the collapse problem lies in the dynamics of ejec-
tion of the mass from the initial column itself, rather than
in the characteristics of the sideways ﬂow.

VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have numerically investigated the collapse and the
spreading of two-dimensional columns of grains onto a
vertical plane using the Contact Dynamics method. This
approach allows for a detailed analysis of the dynamics
of the collapse taking into account the individual grains
energy and trajectory. Our results are generally in good
agreement with previous experimental work carried out
in quasi-2D conﬁgurations [see 1, 11].
The collapse is ﬁrst described in terms of the shape
of the ﬁnal deposit, and more speciﬁcally in terms
of runout distance. A power law dependence of the
renormalized runout distance with the initial aspect
ratio of the columns is found for high aspect ratios, and
a linear dependence is found for low aspect ratios. These
scalings, experimentally observed by previous authors,
are incompatible with a simple friction model of the
collapse dynamics.
We show that the collapse is driven by the free fall of the
column for high enough aspect ratios. The existence, or
absence, of free fall dynamics, can explain the existence
of two diﬀerent scaling laws for the runout distance
depending on the aspect ratio. The propagation of
the front involves a constant velocity phase, followed
by a deceleration phase of signiﬁcant contribution to
the runout distance. The analysis of the mean kinetic
energy of the grains shows that the dissipation process

14

occurring at the bottom of the column can be simply
described by a constant coeﬃcient of restitution.
In
particular, the energy avalaible for the sideways ﬂow
is simply proportional to the initial potential energy.
The detailed analysis of the energy dissipated in the
sideways ﬂow and the work of the ﬂowing mass clearly
establishes that friction is a good approximation of the
dissipation process. Finally, we point at the dynamics
of mass ejection sideways during the column collapse as
playing a predominant role in the spreading dynamics,
and as being responsible for the non-linear behaviour
of the renormalised runout distance. This allows us to
suggest that the scaling laws preceedently discussed for
the runout distance are fortuitous, and should no longer
apply when the aspect ratio increases. A new empirical
ﬁt is proposed, which is compatible with a friction model.

This conclusion has diﬀerent implications:

1. Mass ejection sideways is a mechanism strongly de-
pendent on the geometry of the collapse. In par-
ticular, we expect its eﬀects to be more important
in a 2D conﬁguration, than in the case of an ax-
isymmetric collapse. This might be at the origin
of the diﬀerence is the scaling laws for the runout
distance observed in 2D (or quasi-2D) and axisym-
metric conﬁgurations. In the limit of high aspect
ratios however, the mass ejection tends towards the
ejection of the totality of the initial mass. In that
limit, diﬀerences should no longer be observed be-
tween the 2D and the axisymmetric conﬁguration.
In any case, our results suggest that an analytical
expression of the runout distance should account
for the process of the ejection of grains at the bot-
tom of the collapsing column.

2. The runout distance appears to be strongly depen-
dent on the fall dynamics and not only on the eﬀec-
tive ﬂow properties, namely eﬀective basal friction
in our case. Although high aspect ratios are diﬃ-
cult to ﬁnd in natural context, many rock falls or
slope destabilisations involve a strong acceleration
(and possibly free fall), which is a key aspect of the
material ejection. In a geophysical perspective, this
suggests that the mobility of a natural ﬂow, usu-
ally deﬁned as the ratio of the runout distance to
the initial height of the material, is related to the
early dynamics of the mass release as well as to the
ﬂowing properties of the material.

3. Since the sideways ﬂow undergoes a simple basal
its modelling using
friction dissipation process,
shallow water approaches is possible, but not
straightforward. Indeed, a diﬃculty lies in the de-
scription of the initial conditions represented by the
vertical column collapse, which escapes, intrinsi-
cally, the shallow water assumptions. The issue
is to achieve a correct description of the mass ﬂux
with a limitation of the energy induced by the col-
umn fall. The column collapse dynamics, until now

correctly reproduced only for low aspect ratios [see
7, 12], could also be recovered for high aspect ra-
tios [see 9].

dynamics of the collapse and the spreading will be the
subject of further works.

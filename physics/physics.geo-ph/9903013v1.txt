GIST: A tool for Global Ionospheric Tomography using
GPS ground and LEO data and sources of opportunity
with applications in instrument calibration

Abstract

Ionospheric tomography using GPS data has been reported in the literature and
even the application to radar altimeter calibration was succesfully carried out in a
recent work ( [1]). We here present a new software tool, called Global Ionospheric
Stochastic Tomography software (GIST), and its powerful capability for ingesting GPS
data from diﬀerent sources (ground stations, receivers on board LEO for navigation
and occultation purposes) and other data such as altimetry data to yield global maps
with dense coverage and inherent calibration of the instruments. We show results
obtained including 106 IGS ground stations, GPS/MET low rate occultation data,
TOPEX/POSEIDON GPS data from the navigation antenna and NASA Radar Al-
timeter with the additional beneﬁt of a direct estimation of the NRA bias. The pos-
sibility of ingesting diﬀerent kinds of ionospheric data into the tomographic model
suggest a way to accurately monitor the ionosphere with direct application to single
frequency instrument calibration.

1.

Introduction

Radio waves traversing the ionosphere suﬀer a delay of a well-known dispersive nature
and it is common to suppress this eﬀect by using a combination of signals at two separated
frequencies. However, there are two aspects here to be considered: ﬁrst, the electronic
equipment of on board instrumentation has to be periodically calibrated, and second, du-
plicating systems to operate at two frequencies adds cost and complexity to the instruments.
Therefore it is desirable to have a system able to reproduce the status of the ionosphere,
and use it for monitoring, and single- and dual-frequency instrument calibration. Tomo-
graphic techniques are applied to this end ingesting data from diﬀerent sources. In previous
references [2], [3], [1] we have discussed the tomographic methodology and some diﬀerent
implementations, which we will here brieﬂy summarize. This work intends to highlight the
successful elaboration of a software package that implements those techniques and also to
emphasize the possibility of ingesting data other than GPS to densify the receivers network.

2. Tomographic technique

The ionospheric delay can be determined in a bistatic dual-frequency system from phase

measurements following the equation:

LI (~r, t) = L1 − L2 = γ

dlρ(~r, t) + cr + ct,

(2.1)

Zray

where we have noted the phase measurements with L. The factor γ depends on the fre-
quencies in use (for GPS γ = 1.05 · 10−17 m3/el) and ρ is the electron density. The two

constants cr and ct are the biases associated to the transmitter and receiver ( [4]). Tomo-
graphic analysis consist in obtainting the solution ﬁelds (ρ) from the integrated value along
the ray paths and Equation 2.1 is termed as the “tomographic equation”. If ρ is expressed
j xj (t)Ψj(~r)+ ǫ(~r, t) then the above
as a linear combination of a set of basis functions ρ =
s.l. ΨJ (~r)d~l + ζ(~r, t) + cr + ct and can be written for
equation becomes LI = yi =
each ray to obtain a set of linear equations such as y = A · x. In our tomographic system,
we choose voxels as the basis functions. Voxels are 3-D pixels or fuctions valued 1 inside the
volume of the voxel and 0 elsewhere. Empirical Orthogonal Functions can also be used as
shown in [5].The system, however, may not have a solution because data are not uniformly
distributed, and thus we seek to minimize the functional

(2.2)

In [3] we discussed the use of a correlation functional to conﬁne the spatial spectrum of the
solution to the low portion of the frequency space. The same concept can be expressed by
adding new equations (constraints) that impose that the density in a voxel be a weighted
average of its neighbours ( [2]). To take into account variation in time, a Kalman ﬁlter
is implemented, considering the density to behave as a random walk stochastic process.
Instrumental constants are also considered and resolved as constants or eliminated by dif-
ferencing [4], [6]. While diﬀerencing reduces the number of unknowns, estimation furnishes
the solution with more information and provides nuisance parameters to absorb noise from
the system.

3. The GIST tool for ionospheric tomography

The software tool GIST implements the above described technique including diﬀerencing
and constant estimation strategies (for a block diagram see Figure 1). In addition, since the
previous equations are valid for any dual-frequency system, diﬀerent sources of data should
be used.
It has to be remembered, however, that the tomographic solution is possible
thanks to the diﬀerent directions of the rays received from diﬀerent satellites which permit
the system to distinguish between layers. Therefore, GPS data serve as the basic source
on which the solution is based and any additional data such as altimetric data (which is
always in the same direction) should be fed as an aiding source of information and with the
main goal of constraining the values of ρ to obtain the calibration constants. In monostatic

instrument as part of the overall solution.

The package GIST shares common modules with the package LOTTOS, oriented to

Tropospheric Tomography (see [7]) and has the following features:

• Raw RINEX data conditioning: cycle slip detection, phase alignment, and data deci-

mation.

• Altimeter Data conditioning
• Linear System Construction
• Kalman Filtering with Random Walk Stochastic Process.
• Diﬀerent Constraints Strategies

The input data are GPS raw phases and pseudoranges, precise orbits for all the satellites
in ECI format and time-tagged Total Electron Contents data from other sources. In [1]
we discussed the convenience of the constant estimation in the data processing due to the
robustness of the system and the existence of systematic noise sinks. However, this approach
is computationally intensive and in some cases, for system testing, it is interesting to have
a rapid solution even if it is with low accuracy. In such cases, diﬀerencing is an attractive
approach because it reduces the number of unknowns and it is hence included as an option
in the GIST package; it has to be advised, however, that this technique is more sensitive to
systematic noise in the data or mismodeling.

4. Results

We have taken data from 106 IGS ground stations for 21st February 1997, GPS/MET low
rate data and TOPEX/POSEIDON data from the on-board GPS receiver (zenith-looking
for navigation purposes) and the on-board NRA altimeter data. A global grid with 20 divi-
sions in longitude, 10 divisions in latitude and 6 layers (5 below the TOPEX/POSEIDON
orbit and 1 above to absorbe the protonosphere) has been used and the data divided into
3-hour batches for Kalman ﬁltering. The data were weighted according to the sigma value
of the measurements (0.1 m for GPS data and 1 TECU for TOPEX/POSEIDON [2], [8])
and the orbits for the LEO were estimated using the GIPSY-OASIS II software [9].
In
Figures 2 and 3 we see the 6 layers of the ionosphere, and in Figure 4 the residues for the
T/P altimeter data. The bias constant is 2.98 TECU with a formal error of 2.58 mTECU
for the T/P Radar Altimeter, which agrees fairly well with what was reported in [1].

5. Conclusions

We have successfully developed a solid software tool GIST for ionospheric tomography
and applied it to one day of data to yield 4D ionospheric maps. These maps are consistent
with previous work and, in addition, the ingestion of altimeter data into the model permits
the direct calibration of the instrumentation. We foresee this technique to be a very useful
technique particularly when other sources of opportunity such as GPS data from satellites
or airplanes are included because of the great densiﬁcation of measurements.

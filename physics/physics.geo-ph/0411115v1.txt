Using the Morlet continuous wavelet transform on
data over the period 1871-1990, it is found that the global
wavelet cross spectra between two solar activity indices
and seven major Indian monsoon rainfall time series show
signiﬁcant power around the period of the 11 year so-
lar cycle, passing the χ2 test of signiﬁcance proposed by
Torrence and Compo (1998) at levels exceeding 95% in
10 out of the 14 cases studied. Furthermore two dis-
tinct epochs are found in the computed cross-spectrum,
the transition between them occurring around the decade
1915-1925, beyond which solar activity parameters show
a signiﬁcant increase. By comparison between selected
periods of three cycles in solar activity in each of the two
epochs, it is shown that the average rainfall is higher in
all seven rainfall indices during periods of greater solar
activity, at z-test conﬁdence levels of 95% or greater in
three of them.

1. Introduction

There are numerous studies of the possible inﬂu-
ence of solar activity on terrestrial climate. Although
solar-terrestrial connections have been somewhat scepti-
cally received by much of the meteorological community,
the growing availability of paleo-climate indicators us-
ing novel measurement techniques, and the discovery of
the prominent solar activity period of 11 years in var-
ied climate records using new mathematical tools, are
producing increasingly strong evidence for possible asso-
ciation between solar processes and terrestrial weather
and climate indices (Beer et al.(1990), Friis-Christensen
and Lassen (1991), Lassen and Friis-Christensen (1995),
Haigh (1996, 1999, 2001), Labitzke and Loon (1997),
Mehta and Lau (1997)). Doubts about eﬀects on shorter
time scales (of the order of 100y) seem however to re-
main. Earlier studies of possible connections between
Indian monsoon rainfall and solar activity (Jagannathan
and Bhalme (1973) and Jagannathan and Parthasarathy
(1973)), using correlation and power spectral analysis
of the rainfall distribution in 48 meteorological stations
spread all over India, reported presence of the 11-year
sunspot cycle at signiﬁcance levels of 95% or higher in 5
of them.

The possibility of shedding light on the variability of
the Indian monsoon using wavelet techniques (Kailas and
Narasimha (2000), Narasimha and Kailas (2001)), and
the idea that the tropics can amplify a small radiant ﬂux
signal to a relatively large and dynamic climate change

elsewhere in the world as well (Haigh (2001), Visser et
al. (2003)), serve to provide further motivation for the
present work.
In a recent study by Neﬀ et al. (2001),
strong coherence between the solar variability and the
monsoon in Oman in the period between 9 and 6 kyr
B.P. has been reported.

There has been a recent surge in interest in incorpo-
rating wavelet techniques for climate signal detection and
analysis, as can be seen in the works of Lau and Weng
(1995) and Torrence and Compo (1998). In particular,
Narasimha and Kailas (2001), analysing Indian monsoon
rainfall, identiﬁed six ’quasi cycles’, with average periods
of 2.92, 5.8, 11.4, 19.9, 34.2 and 79.8 y. These num-
bers suggested the presence of several super- and sub-
harmonics of the basic sun-spot period of about 11 y.
Iyengar and Raghukantha (2004) have identiﬁed intrinsic
modes with periods virtually identical to those observed
by Narasimha and Kailas (2001).

In continuation of this on-going research, we now
present an analysis of the association between indicators
of solar activity and Indian monsoon rainfall, using the
continuous wavelet transform method with the Morlet
wavelet function.

2. The data analysed

Seven annual area-weighted rainfall time series for the
period 1871-1990 have been considered for the analysis,
namely, all India summer monsoon rainfall (AISMR),
north east India (NEI), north west India (NWI), cen-
tral north east India (CNEI), west central India (WCI),
peninsular India (PENSI) and the homogeneous Indian
monsoon (HIM)(Parthasarathyet al (1995)). The choice
of these regions is based on several well deﬁned crite-
ria including primarily a considerable degree of spatial
coherence. The HIM region covers the central and north-
western parts of India amounting to 55% of the total land
area of the country, and may be seen as the most char-
acteristic index of the component of Indian rainfall dom-
inated by the dynamics of the south west monsoon. As
it is well known that the NEI region shows in many ways
an anti-correlation with the HIM region (Parthasarathy
et al. 1993), we present more detailed results speciﬁcally
for these two regions.

The range of scales over which these rainfall data can
provide useful information on temporal variability is lim-
ited at one end by resolution, since not more than 12
points per year are available, and at the other end by
the limited length of data stretch of 120 years. For the
present study we have found annual rainfall to be the
most appropriate rainfall index to use. The solar in-
dices under study are sunspot number index and group
sunspot number. Sunspot areas have also been stud-
ied, but have been found to provide no new informa-
tion. The sunspot index data have been obtained from
Rai Choudhuri (1999) and Fligge et al. (1999), and the
data for group sunspot number from the NOAA ftp site
ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/SOLAR DATA.

We must note one important diﬀerence between the
rainfall and sunspot data. The former are cumula-
tive, the monthly data being a sum of the daily data.
That is not the case for sunspot data, since individual
sunspots live typically for several days. All monthly
data of sunspots are usually compiled by taking av-
erages of daily data over a month. The monthly av-
erage sunspot number plotted against time does not
for example, the website
appear very smooth (see,

http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/image/zurich.gif).
As our aim here is to study possible correlations of the
rainfall data with solar processes with time scales of order
years to decades, we ﬁlter out ﬂuctuations in the sunspot
data at small time scales by using yearly sunspot and
group sunspot numbers.

4. Results

A plot of the annual time series of the four rainfall and
two solar indices under consideration is shown in ﬁgure
1. The rainfall time series appear irregular and random,
while the solar indicators have a clearly cyclic character.
The results of the present analysis are presented in
the form of colour-coded contour maps (see ﬁgures 2 and
3) of wavelet cross power spectra as functions of time
and Fourier period (henceforth refered to as period) re-
spectively for HIM and NEI rainfall. Outlined on these
graphs are thick contours enclosing regions where wavelet
cross power exceeds 95% conﬁdence levels, with respect
to the reference spectra mentioned above. The cones of
inﬂuence within which edge eﬀects become important are
also indicated by dashed lines in the ﬁgures.

Figures 4 and 5 show several global wavelet power
spectra as functions of period for HIM and NEI rain-
fall. For HIM rainfall (ﬁgure 2), a wavelet cross power of
noticeably high magnitude is observed at the middle of
the period range 8-16 years. An integration over time of
this wavelet cross power, which gives the global wavelet
cross power spectrum, is shown in ﬁgure 4.
It can be
seen clearly from this ﬁgure that the cross wavelet power
crosses the 95% conﬁdence line at a period of around 11
years. Circles and squares respectively denote the con-
tributions of the individual global wavelet power of the
rainfall and the sunspot time series to the global spec-
trum. It is seen that the contribution of the 8-16 year
period band is 16.8% for the total rainfall and 82.8% for
the sunspot index.

Figures 3 and 5 show plots similar respectively to ﬁg-
ures 2 and 4 but for NEI rainfall and group sunspot
number. Signiﬁcant power is observed in the 8-16 year
period band in this case also. The global cross wavelet
power spectrum also crosses the 95% conﬁdence line in
the period range 8-16 years (ﬁgure 5); the correspond-
ing cross power (see ﬁgure 2) is however lower than that
for HIM. The highest cross power is observed during pe-
riods 1890-1905 and 1915-1965 in the former case, and
during 1880-1920 and 1935-1980 in the latter case.
In
both cases, therefore, there is strong indication of two
relatively distinct epochs, the transition from one to the
other occurring around 1915-1925. As may be seen from
Figure 1, solar activity generally shows an increase be-
yond this decade, suggesting that higher solar activity is
associated with the higher cross spectrum.

Similar analyses have been carried out for the other 5
rainfall indices as well, and the results are summarised in
Table 1. It will be seen that, except for NEI and PENSI
rainfall, all the other cases show up regions of cross power
at conﬁdence levels exceeding 95% at the 8-16 year period
band.

From ﬁgure 1, two epochs of low and high group
sunspot number can be identiﬁed, this transition also oc-
curring around 1915 to 1925. We select here one time

interval in each of the two epochs, namely 1878-1913 and
1933-1964 respectively, during each of which three com-
plete solar cycles are present (considering the period from
one minimum to the next as one complete cycle). Table
1 lists the annual rainfall means µ1 and µ2 respectively
for the two periods 1878-1913 and 1933-1964; both the
epochs and the corresponding means are shown in ﬁgure
1. The null hypothesis that the diﬀerence in mean annual
rainfall between these two periods is zero is rejected at
the maximum conﬁdence levels listed in Table 1 using a
one-tailed z-test (Crow et al. 1960). Thus the mean an-
nual rainfall during 1933-64 (higher solar activity) is ev-
erywhere higher than that during the period (1878-1913)
of lower solar activity. However the conﬁdence levels are
95% or higher in 3 cases out 7, including AISMR and
HIM, and reaching 99% in WCI. At the other extreme,
it is a low 75% in NEI and NWI.

The ratio of wavelet power present in the period 8-16
years to the total rainfall wavelet power is also presented
in table 1. So are the ratios of cross wavelet power be-
tween the rainfall and group sunspot number in the 8-16
year band to the total cross wavelet power. In the case
of HIM and WCI, which show the solar-monsoon link at
the highest conﬁdence levels, the cross spectrum is also
high (about 56%), and the contribution from the 8-16 y
band is nearly 17%. It will be seen from Table 1 that, in
general, signiﬁcant eﬀects on rainfall go with signiﬁcant
levels of cross power. The exception is the arid region
NWI, where the lower signiﬁcance levels for the diﬀer-
ences in rainfall are due to the large relative standard
deviation.

Incidentally the present results demonstrate the ad-
vantages of the wavelet approach, as compared with
classical correlation/power spectral density methods: (i)
wavelets permit identiﬁcation of epochs during which cor-
relations at diﬀerent signiﬁcance levels may have pre-
vailed; (ii) wavelet methods allow us to take account of
slight variations in the eﬀective period or scale (’mean-
dering’) of the eﬀect of a given forcing (as may be seen
from the regions of high cross spectra in ﬁgures 2 and 3),
such meandering being presumably the result of the non-
linear interactions between diﬀerent modes of the system.

5. Conclusions

The present study,

involving two solar index time
series and seven Indian rainfall time series and using
wavelet cross spectral density analysis as outlined by Tor-
rence and Compo (1998), reveals considerable power in
the global cross power spectra around the 11 year solar
cycle period for all the indices considered. In particular
the global cross power spectra for AISMR, WCI and HIM
rainfall with the group sunspot number reveal a signiﬁ-
cant peak at the 11 year period at conﬁdence levels of 95%
or higher. Greater solar activity seems to be associated
in all cases with greater rainfall, although at signiﬁcance
levels that are distinctly high in 3 and lower in 4 out of 7
cases studied. This regional variation is not inconsistent
with the simulations of Haigh et al. (2004), which sug-
gest that a major eﬀect of higher solar activity may be
a displacement in the Hadley cell. Such a displacement,
depending on its magnitude, can have diﬀerent eﬀects on
rainfall in diﬀerent regions.

Estimating stress heterogeneity from aftershock rate
Agn`es Helmstetter and Bruce E. Shaw
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, New York

Abstract. We estimate the rate of aftershocks triggered by a heterogeneous stress change,
using the rate-and-state model of Dieterich [1994]. We show than an exponential stress
distribution P (τ ) ∼ exp(−τ /τ0) gives an Omori law decay of aftershocks with time ∼
1/tp, with an exponent p = 1 − Aσn/τ0, where A is a parameter of the rate-and-state
friction law, and σn the normal stress. Omori exponent p thus decreases if the stress ”het-
erogeneity” τ0 decreases. We also invert the stress distribution P (τ ) from the seismic-
ity rate R(t), assuming that the stress does not change with time. We apply this method
to a synthetic stress map, using the (modiﬁed) scale invariant ”k2” slip model [Herrero
and Bernard, 1994]. We generate synthetic aftershock catalogs from this stress change.
The seismicity rate on the rupture area shows a huge increase at short times, even if the
stress decreases on average. Aftershocks are clustered in the regions of low slip, but the
spatial distribution is more diﬀuse than for a simple slip dislocation. Because the stress
ﬁeld is very heterogeneous, there are many patches of positive stress changes everywhere
on the fault. This stochastic slip model gives a Gaussian stress distribution, but nev-
ertheless produces an aftershock rate which is very close to Omori’s law, with an eﬀec-
tive p ≤ 1, which increases slowly with time. The inversion of the full stress distribu-
tion P (τ ) is badly constrained for negative stress values, and for very large positive val-
ues, if the time interval of the catalog is limited. However, constraining P (τ ) to be a Gaus-
sian distribution allows a good estimation of P (τ ) for a limited number of events and
catalog duration. We show that stress shadows are very diﬃcult to observe in a hetero-
geneous stress context.

1. Introduction

Much progress has been made in describing earthquake
behavior based on the predictions of rate-and-state friction.
The rate-and-state model explains the 1/t decay of after-
shock rate as a function of the time t since the mainshock
(Omori’s law) independent of the mainshock magnitude, the
scaling of aftershock duration with stressing rate, the slow
diﬀusion of aftershocks with time [Dieterich, 1994]. This
success led several authors to provide time-dependent earth-
quake probabilities using this model [Toda et al., 1998; 2003;
2005]. Many other physical mechanisms have been proposed
to explain Omori law, such as sub-critical crack growth [Das
and Scholz, 1981; Shaw, 1993], viscous relaxation [Mikumo
and Miyatake, 1979], static fatigue [Scholz, 1968; Narteau et
al., 2002], postseismic slip [Schaﬀ et al., 1998], or pore ﬂuid
ﬂow [Nur and Booker, 1972]. The rate-and-state model of
Dieterich [1994] is probably the best candidate, however,
because it only relies on a rate-and-state dependent friction
law observed in laboratory experiments.

At the same time, a number of fundamental puzzles re-
main. One of the most striking is the abundance of af-
tershocks on the rupture surface, where indeed most after-
shocks occur. This is in stark contrast with simple pictures
of the rupture process, which suggest stress should have de-
creased on the rupture surface and there should therefore be
a dearth of aftershocks there. A second fundamental puzzle
concerns the time dependence of aftershocks. Here, subtle
but signiﬁcant deviations from the pure Omori law inverse
time decay of the rate of aftershocks is seen in averages of
aftershock rates [Helmstetter et al., 2005]. While Dieterich
[1994] explained this as a consequence of the spatial depen-
dence of stress as it decreases away from the fault, or as a

change of stressing rate with time, such mechanisms do not
seem to properly explain the aftershocks occurring on the
rupture area. Thus, both the spatial and temporal distri-
bution of the majority of aftershocks have yet to be fully
explained. Here, we show how an extension of the rate-
and-state formulation, which takes as its foundation a het-
erogeneous stress ﬁeld, can explain these observations. We
then use this model to estimate stress heterogeneity from
aftershock rates.

Our work builds oﬀ of the pioneering work of Dieterich
[1994], who derived a relation between seismicity rate and
stress history, for a population of faults obeying rate-and-
state friction. For a uniform positive stress step (e.g., a
mainshock), the rate-and-state model gives an Omori law
t−p with p = 1 for
decay of the seismicity rate R(t)
intermediate times. At very short times, smaller than a
characteristic time c which depends on the stress change,
the seismicity rate is constant. Dieterich [1994] also com-
puted the aftershock rate for a dislocation, with a uniform
stress decrease on the rupture area, and a positive stress
1/√r in the
change outside the rupture, decaying as τ
near ﬁeld, and τ
L. As
distance from the fault increases, the characteristic time c
(typical time between mainshock and aftershocks) increases.
Integrating over the fault, the seismicity rate approximately
1/tp, with an apparent exponent
obeys Omori law R(t)
p < 1 increasing slowly with time.

Dieterich et al.

[2000, 2003] used the rate-and-state
model of seismicity to invert stress history from seismic-
ity rate, and apply this method to Hawaii seismicity. They
discretize the space, with a grid size of about 1 km, and
assume that the stress is uniform in each cell. This method
then gives the stress history in each cell. The assumption
that the stress is uniform at scales of a few km is reason-
able for the stress change induced by a dyke intrusion, as
in [Dieterich, 2000, 2003], or for the coseismic stress change
induced by a large earthquake in the far ﬁeld. However, the

where τ is the ”modiﬁed” Coulomb stress change [Dieterich
et al., 2000], and σn is the normal stress,. The state variable
γ is a function of the seismicity rate R(t, τ )

Putting (9) and (10) in (7), we get

coseismic stress change on the mainshock fault plane, where
most aftershocks occur, is probably very heterogeneous at
all scales [Herrero and Bernard, 1994].

Here we try to estimate the stress distribution on the
fault plane from the aftershock rate, using the rate-and-state
model. We assume that the stress changes instantaneously
after the mainshock, and we neglect the relaxation of stress
on the fault due to aseismic slip or viscous relaxation. We
also neglect the stress change, and seismicity rate change,
induced by aftershocks.

2. Relation between stress distribution and
seismicity rate

Dieterich [1994] derives a diﬀerential equation which gives
the seismicity rate R(t, τ ) as a function of the stress history
τ (t). His model assumes an inﬁnite population of faults
which obeys rate and state friction, with the same proper-
ties for all faults.

The state variable γ is related to the stress τ by

A generally has values between 0.005 and 0.02, for various
temperature and pressure conditions [Dieterich, 1994].

Dieterich [1994] used expression (1) to derive the seismic-
ity rate R(t, τ ) triggered by a single stress step τ . We assume
that stress rate after the stress step is constant dτ /dt = ˙τr,
and that the seismicity rate before the mainshock is equal
to the reference seismicity rate Rr. Using (1), the seismicity
rate following the stress step is

stress distribution from the seismicity rate. This is a diﬃ-
cult problem, because, as shown in Figure 1, the seismicity
rate does not depend on the stress change over a relatively
large time interval.

Expression (6) corresponds to Omori law with an exponent

This result shows that, in order to observe a pure Omori law
at short times with an exponent p < 1, the stress ﬁeld must
have an exponential distribution in the tail, for large positive
stress. The stress distribution for small or negative values
does not aﬀect the seismicity rate at short times t
ta.
Expression (12) shows that Omori exponent depends on the
heterogeneity of the stress ﬁeld. The parameter τ0 repre-
sents the width of the stress distribution for τ > 0. The
more heterogeneous the stress is (larger τ0), the larger p is
(closer to 1). Figure 2 illustrates how the rate-and-state
model with a heterogeneous stress distribution produces a
power-law decay with an exponent p < 1.

≪

Helmstetter et al.

[2005] found that, for stacked after-
shock sequences in Southern California, Omori exponent is
close to 0.9, for times ranging between a minute (but possi-
bly even less) and one year, and for mainshock magnitudes
between 2 and 7.5. This suggests that the stress distribution
is close to exponential in the tail, with a characteristic (non-
normalized) stress τ0 = 10Aσn. Assuming that A = 0.01
(as measured in laboratory friction experiments [Dieterich,
1994]) and σn = 100 MPa (corresponding to the lithostatic
pressure at a depth of about 5 km), this gives Aσn = 1 MPa
and τ0 = 10 MPa, a value larger than the typical stress drop
σ0 = 3 MPa [Ide and Beroza, 2001], but of the same order
of magnitude.

The rate-and-state model with a uniform stress step (3)
cannot explain an Omori law decay with p > 1. Equation (7)
does not have a solution with P (τ ) > 0 and t
ta in this
case. Some aftershock sequences however have an Omori
exponent larger than one. The only solution in order to ob-
tain a p-value larger than one in the rate-and-state model is
to have a variation of stress with time, which may be due
to postseismic slip or viscous relaxation, although these ex-
planations involve relatively large stess changes with time
[Dieterich, 1994]. Other explanations for Omori’s law do al-
low for larger p-values [Mikumo and Miayatake, 1979; Shaw,
1993; Narteau et al., 2002].

We have shown above that, according to the rate-and-
state model, the Omori exponent provides some information
on the stress heterogeneity (but only if p < 1). Furthermore,
we can (in theory) obtain the complete stress distribution
(in the region where we measure the seismicity rate) from
the temporal evolution of the seismicity rate. Expression
(6) indeed provides a method for estimating the full distri-
bution P (τ ), provided we observe the seismicity rate R(t)
over a wide enough time interval.

We ﬁrst discretize the integration over stress (using the
same number of stress intervals as the number N of points
for which R(t) is measured). Equation (6) is then similar to
the system of linear equations

where σ0 is the stress drop (typically 3 MPa), µ is the rigid-

factor close to 1. For wavelengths larger than the rupture
length L, the power spectrum is constant

u(k) = C

for k < 1/L .

This model (16) reproduces the 1/f 2 power-spectrum of seis-
mograms for large frequencies [Herrero and Bernard, 1994].

posed problem, i.e., the solution is very sensitive to noise.

introduce an additional constraint to (13), minimizing either
the ﬁrst derivative

distance between P (τ ) and an initial guess P0(τ ). (e.g., a

In practice, the estimation of P (τ ) for large τ is limited
by the minimum time tmin at which we can reliably esti-
mate the seismicity rate. The largest stress we can resolve
is of the order of τmax =
Aσn log(tmin/ta). Practically, this
time tmin may be as low as a few seconds, if we correct from
catalog incompleteness shortly after the mainshock [Vidale
et al., 2004]. For negative stress, we are limited by the maxi-
mum time tmax after the mainshock, and by our assumptions
that secondary aftershocks are negligible, and that the stress
does not change with time (e.g., neglecting post-seismic re-
laxation). In order to resolve P (τ ) for negative values, we
need to know the seismicity rate for times larger than the
aftershock duration ta (i.e., usually at least a few years).
Indeed, the seismicity rate after a stress decrease is close to

4. Application of the method to a stochastic
slip model
4.1. Stochastic k2 slip model

We have tested the rate-and-state model on a realistic
synthetic slip pattern. Herrero and Bernard [1994] proposed
a kinematic, self-similar model of earthquakes. They as-
sumed that the slip distribution at small scales, compared

We have used the k2 model to generate a synthetic slip
pattern, and compute the shear stress change on the fault
from the slip [Andrews, 1980; Ripperger and Mai, 2004].
Note that the seismicity rate given by (3) depends on the
Coulomb stress change, which is equal to the shear stress
change on the fault because the normal stress change on
If we analyze oﬀ-fault aftershocks

or complex ruptures, we would have to consider changes in
normal stress as well.

We have modiﬁed the k2 model in order to have a ﬁnite
standard deviation of the stress distribution. The k2 model
(16) produces a shear stress change with a power spectrum
k−1 for large k, because the stress is approximately
τ (k)
the derivative of the slip. As a consequence, the shear stress
change for the k2 model is extremely heterogeneous, with
an inﬁnite standard deviation. The exponent n = 2 in the
k2 model (16) is thus a minimum physical value for the
slip power-spectrum [Herrero and Bernard, 1994]. Using
−2 produces a shear stress change with a stan-
u(k)
dard deviation which diverges logarithmically as the max-
imum wavenumber increases. Thus Omori p-value for this
slip model tends to 1 as the grid resolution increases. We
have thus replaced the exponent n = 2 in (16) by n = 2.3,
and smoothed the crossover at k = 1/L, using

(i.e., the average stress change on the fault is
The maps of the slip and stress on the fault are shown in
Figure 3. The stress ﬁeld has large variations, from about
-90 to 90 MPa, due to slip variability. We did not constrain
the slip to be positive. This could be done by changing the
phase of the lowest mode, and tapering the slip close to the
edges, so that the maximum slip is at the center [Herrero
and Bernard, 1994]. Doing so introduces small deviations
of the stress distribution from a Gaussian distribution for
0, but does not introduce signiﬁcant changes on the
τ
seismicity rate .

We have then estimated the seismicity rate on the fault
predicted by the rate-and-state model, by integrating nu-
merically (5) using the observed stress map, and assuming
Aσn = 1 MPa. While the stress on average decreases on
the fault, the seismicity rate shows a huge increase after the
mainshock (by a factor 1010, but, of course, the seismicity

quake, has no physical sense) (see Figure 4). It then decays
with time approximately according to Omori law, with an
apparent exponent p = 0.93. At large times t
ta, the
seismicity rate decreases below its reference rate due to the
negative stress values.

4.3. Synthetic aftershock catalog

We have generated synthetic earthquake catalogs accord-
ing to the rate-and-state model, using the (modiﬁed) k2
model (18) to generate the stress change. We have simu-
lated aftershock sequences triggered by this heterogeneous
stress change, without including earthquakes interaction
(i.e., without coseismic stress changes induced by after-
shocks)), using the method of Dieterich et al. [2003].

We assume a non-stationary Poisson process with an av-
erage seismicity rate R(t, τ ) given by (3). In each cell, we
generate events one after the other. After each event, the
probability that the next event will occur at time t + x after
the mainshock is given by

erence rate Rr, and of time interval tmin
tmax (see Table 1),
in order to test how the inversion method depends on the
quality of the catalog.

4.4.

Inversion of stress history from seismicity rate

We have ﬁrst applied the method of Dieterich et al. [2000,
2003] on this synthetic stress ﬁeld shown in Figure 3b. Di-
eterich et al.
[2000, 2003] estimate the stress history τ (t)
at any point on a grid, assuming that the stress change is
homogeneous in each cell, but may change with time. The
stress history is obtained from the seismicity rate by solving
equation (1). We wanted to apply this method on this syn-
thetic stress model to test how stress heterogeneity aﬀects
the inverted stress change. The results are shown in Fig-
ure 5. The inverted stress change at short times is close to
100 MPa, and then decreases
the maximum stress change
≈
down to a value close to the average stress change
3 MPa
at large times t > ta. Dividing the fault into smaller size
cells would not improve the results very much. Because this
slip model is self-similar, there are almost everywhere some
parts of the fault where the stress (and thus the seismicity
rate) increases. This shows that a small-scale stress hetero-
geneity, without any time dependence, is interpreted by this
method as a variation of stress with time. Also, it shows
that a stress decrease cannot be resolved if it is mixed with
a stress increase, unless looking at very long times. This
may explain why stress shadows are so diﬃcult to observe
[Felzer et al., 2005].

rate

This test shows that variability with time and small-scale
heterogeneity in space cannot be distinguished based on the
temporal evolution of the seismicity rate. In order to char-
acterize the coseismic stress change on the fault plane, we
thus need to neglect one eﬀect (small-scale heterogeneity) or
the other (time variation). Our method estimates the stress
distribution on the fault from the seismicity rate, assum-
ing that stress does not change with time. In theory (if we
had an inﬁnite time interval, a huge number of aftershocks,

no foreshocks or secondary aftershocks, and if we knew the
parameters Rr, ta, and Aσn), this method provides the dis-
tribution of stress on the fault. If the fault is divided into
smaller cells, this method gives a map of the average stress
change in each cell, as well as its variability.

For each synthetic catalog, we have measured the seis-
micity rate on the fault by smoothing aftershock times. We
used a kernel method to estimate R(t) from aftershocks time
ti, with i = 1 to N , with a log-normal ﬁlter

We then used the inversion method described in section 3
to estimate the stress distribution P (τ ) from the seismicity
rate. We used the regularisation condition L(P ) = P ′ in
(15), i.e., minimizing the derivative of P (τ ), using α = 104
(decreasing α produces huge ﬂuctuations of P (τ )). We have
also estimated the Gaussian stress distribution that best ﬁts
the observed seismicity rate. We evaluate the mean and
the standard deviation of the Gaussian function, as well as
the aftershock duration ta, by minimizing the mean-square
residuals of the logarithm of the seismicity rate (using a
simplex algorithm).

Table 1 gives the parameters of each simulation, and the
results of the inversion. Figures 7 and 9 show the real stress
distribution (evaluated from the stress map shown in Fig-
ure 3b) and the inverted one, for each synthetic aftershock
catalog. We test both inversion methods, either solving (15)
for P (τ ) for 80 < τ < 80 MPa, or assuming a Gaussian stress
distribution.

Figure 4 compares the theoretical seismicity rate given
by (5) using the observed stress ﬁeld, with the seismicity
rate estimated from the seismicity catalog using (20), and
with the reconstructed seismicity rate estimated using (6)
from the inverted stress distribution. For this synthetic cat-
alog, the seismicity rate is almost indistinguishable from an
Omori law with an exponent p = 0.93 for t/ta < 10.

In all cases, the stress distribution inverted assuming a
Gaussian distribution is very close to the real one, when the
stress drop is ﬁxed to its real value, and when Omori ex-
ponent is signiﬁcantly smaller than 1. Even for simulation

However, if σ0 is inverted, then the best ﬁtting Gaussian
distribution becomes very diﬀerent from the real P (τ ) for
simulation #4. Keeping the catalogue time intervals con-
stant between models #2 and #3, but reducing the number
of events in the catalogue by a factor
10 (by increasing
the minimum magnitude by one unit), we ﬁnd the value of

very diﬀerent values of ta and σ0 can produce very simi-
lar seismicity rate R(t) for t < ta/100, as can be shown in
Figure 8.

When inverting for the complete distribution P (τ ), the
results are pretty good for the ﬁrst simulation, with an un-
realistic large time interval and number of events. There are
however deviations in the tails, for τ > 30 MPa, which cor-

respond to very short times t/ta
much smaller than the minimum time tmin/ta = 10−10 used
for the inversion of P (τ ). For catalogs #2-4 in Table 1, the
distribution of P (τ ) is not constrained for τ < 0, and for

In this
case, we have almost no resolution on P (τ ) for τ < 0. This
method only provides a rough estimate of the width of the
distribution for τ > 0.

4.6. Oﬀ-fault aftershocks

△

(cid:18)
We can make simple estimates of the stress change and
seismicity rate oﬀ of the fault plane. For mode III rup-
ture, static elasticity reduces to a Laplacian
u = 0. For a
Laplacian, a Fourier mode with wavenumber k along an in-
ﬁnite fault decays exponentially into the bulk proportional
to k times the distance y to the fault. With these basis
functions, we can easily extrapolate oﬀ of the fault, al-
though since it neglects rupture end eﬀects, it is valid only
for distances less than the rupture length L and in areas
along-side the mainshock rupture area, and not extending
into the lobes of increasing stress beyond the ﬁnite rupture
length. Thus, we are looking at regions which would be in
the stress ”shadow” of a simple rupture. Within this region,
at a distance y < L from the fault, the power-spectrum of
the displacement for the modiﬁed slip model (18) becomes
−2.3 exp(
u(k, y)
ky). The power-spectrum of
(kL + 1)
the stress change is given by

(21)

This shows how the stress heterogeneity decays very rapidly
with distance from the rupture surface.

−

Figure 10a shows the seismicity rate for diﬀerent values of
the distance from the fault y/L, using the slip model shown
in Figure 3a. We computed the stress at a distance y from
k y), i.e., multiply-
the fault using τ (k, y) = τ (k, 0) exp(
ing the stress map shown in Figure 3b by exp(
k y) in the
Fourier domain. The stress distribution is reasonably close
to a Gaussian distribution at all distances. Therefore, we
have used the best-ﬁtting Gaussian distribution in order to
compute the seismicity rate shown in Figure 10a. The stan-
dard deviation of the stress distribution decreases very fast
with the distance to the fault, which produces a strong drop
of the seismicity rate oﬀ of the fault. The average stress
decreases much slower with y. For y/L > 0.1, the stress
ﬁeld is very homogeneous and mostly negative (the stan-
dard deviation is smaller than the absolute mean stress).
Therefore, the seismicity rate for y/L > 0.1 is smaller than
the reference rate at all times t < ta.

−

In practice, it is diﬃcult to analyze the rate of oﬀ-fault
aftershocks, since very few earthquakes occur oﬀ of the fault
plane, because the stress changes are smaller, and because
the reference seismicity rate oﬀ the fault is much smaller that
on the fault. Also, secondary aftershocks triggered by oﬀ-
fault events will perturb the stress ﬁeld and seismicity rate
with additional stress heterogeneity. Our seismicity rate es-
timates here presume focal mechanisms of aftershocks sim-
ilar to the mainshock focal mechanism; other focal mech-
anisms could have diﬀerent rates, but optimally oriented
plane estimates may not be the best approach [McCloskey
et al., 2003].
In any case, we do see very rapid falloﬀ of
the seismicity with distance from the fault, a point which
deserves further observational exploration. Note that Fig-
ure 10a shows the seismicity rate normalized by the reference
rate Rr. If Rr decreases with the distance to the fault, the
decrease of the aftershock rate with y will be even faster
than shown in Figure 10a.

4.7. Gaussian versus exponential stress distribution

While the pure Omori law with p < 1 occurs for the
exponential distribution of shear stress changes, we ﬁnd nu-
merically that a Gaussian stress distribution (which the k2
model and many other models give), also gives realistic look-
ing p-values over wide ranges of time scales. Some insight

Expression (22) shows that the exponential distribution
closer to the Gaussian one for a stress τ has a character-
istic parameter τ0 = τ ∗2/(τ + σ0) corresponding to an ef-
fective Omori exponent p = 1
Aσn/τ0. As Figure 2 illus-
trates, the more important contribution to the aftershock
rate at time t
ta is due to stress values of the order of
τc =
Aσn log(t/ta). If the stress change obeys a Gaussian
distribution, stresses larger than τc are less frequent than
for τ = τc, therefore they have a smaller contribution to the
seismicity rate at time t. Smaller stress values τ < τc are
more frequent, but the seismicity rate at time t is negligible
compared to larger stress values. The eﬀective Omori expo-
nent at time t, for a Gaussian stress distribution of mean

p with time computed by integrating numerically (6), us-
ing Aσn = 1 MPa, for a Gaussian stress distribution with
σ0 = 3 MPa and τ ∗ = 10 MPa. The approximate solution
(23) for Omori exponent is very good for short times t

but the diﬀerence with the exact solution increases as time

5. Discussion
5.1. Normal stress heterogeneity

Normal stress heterogeneity enters the problem in two
ways, through the “modiﬁed” Coulomb stress change τ , and
through the Aσn term in the denominator. For normal stress
changes which are small compared to the normal stress, the
τ eﬀect will dominate the heterogeneity. With the time de-
pendence of the seismicity alone being the source of informa-
tion, through the p-value analyzed here, we cannot distin-
guish between shear stress heterogeneities and normal stress
heterogeneities. We have done tests with synthetic models
generated using heterogeneity on both τ and Aσn. We found
that the inverted shear stress distribution P (τ ), estimated
using Aσn ﬁxed to its average value, was very close to the
real P (τ ). This shows that our inversion method is robust
with respect to ﬂuctuations of Aσn, even for relatively large
heterogeneity on Aσn, with typical variations of a factor 10.
Our discussion with the synthetic catalogs has focussed
on shear stress changes, since normal stress changes vanish
on planar faults, but rough faults can also engender normal
stress changes [Dieterich, 2005]. Finding other eﬀects which
might be able to separate out these contributions of shear

X - 6

stress heterogeneities and normal stress heterogeneities re-
mains an area worthy of further inquiry.

5.2. Foreshocks

An assumption of our model is that the seismicity rate be-
fore the mainshock is equal to the reference seismicity rate.
But most mainshocks are preceded by foreshocks, so that
the seismicity rate R0 before the mainshock is usually larger
than the reference rate Rr. Using the results of Dieterich
[1994], we can take into account this eﬀect by replacing the
term e

−τ /Aσn in (3) by

The eﬀect of increasing R0 is thus equivalent to shifting
the stress distribution toward larger values, by the amount
Aσn log(R0/Rr). Not correcting for this eﬀect will thus
over-estimate the stress change.

(cid:17)(cid:17)

(cid:16)

5.3. Secondary aftershocks

We have neglected in this study the role of aftershocks
in changing the seismicity rate and redistributing the stress.
We know that most aftershocks may be secondary after-
shocks, triggered by previous aftershocks [Felzer et al., 2003;
Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003]. Ziv and Rubin [2003] stud-
ied a quasi-static fault model that is governed by rate- and
state-dependent friction. They have shown that, if the main-
shock is modeled as a uniform stress increase, the eﬀect
of secondary aftershocks in the rate-and-state model is to
renormalize the seismicity rate without changing its time
dependence (i.e., without changing Omori p value). If the
stress change induced by the mainshock is non-uniform, mul-
tiple interactions between earthquakes modify the spatial
distribution of aftershocks [Ziv, 2003].

Therefore, secondary aftershocks should not change the
value of the width of the stress distribution inverted from the
aftershock decay on the mainshock fault. But they may bias
the value of the average stress change. More tests should be
done on synthetic aftershock catalogs in order to validate
the method, and test the eﬀect of foreshocks and secondary
aftershocks.

6. Conclusion

We have shown how a new extension of the rate-and-
state friction formulation for seismicity rates, which takes
as its foundation a heterogeneous stress ﬁeld, can explain
the most prevalent and puzzling of aftershocks, those which
occur on the mainshock rupture area. With this point of
view, subtle but signiﬁcant deviations from the pure inverse
time omori exponent are mapped onto measures of stress
change heterogeneity on the fault. This contrasts with the
established methodology of Dieterich et al.
[2000, 2003],
in which these deviations are mapped onto time depen-
dent stress changes following the mainshock. Taking the
point of view that stress heterogeneities can be quite large
at the local scale on the fault surface which ruptured, we
have gained insights into a number of topics of relevance
to stress heterogeneities and earthquake behavior. Regard-
ing stress shadows, we have seen how they are very diﬃ-
cult to detect in a heterogeneous stress context, relying on
subtle details in the seismicity rates at times of order ta,
subtleties which would become even more diﬃcult to de-
tect if ta were nonuniform. Regarding stress heterogeneities
relative to mean stress changes, we have found in our ef-
forts to model seismicity changes with scale invariant slip
distributions that typical stress changes are actually larger
than mean stress drops on faults, so that a picture of a very
rough stress distribution on a fault which has broken is a

much better picture than standard crack-like models, which
tend to concentrate aftershocks at the edges of ruptures.
This provides important constraints on physical models of
earthquakes. Finally, we have shown that modest catalogue
lengths allow an accurate inversion for some stress hetero-
geneity parameters, particularly in the constrained case of
Gaussian stress changes. Since stress heterogeneity is a huge
topic of relevance to a wide variety of seismological phenom-
ena, application of this technique to real catalogues, which
we are currently pursuing, should be very exciting.

t < ta/100, with exponent p = 0.93. The pink line is the
ﬁt with the rate-and-state model assuming a Gaussian
∗
P (τ ) and inverting for ta, τ
, and σ0. The green line is
the same as the pink line, but with a stress drop σ0 ﬁxed
to its real value. All curves are essentially superposed,
because the seismicity rate is very close to Omori’s law
for t < ta/100, because the large number of events in the
simulated catalog allows a good reconstruction of the the-
oretical seismicity rate, and because the inverted stress
distribution is very close to the real one.

Figure 7. The thick red line is the stress distribution es-
timated directly from the stress map shown in Figure 3b.
The black line is the stress distribution inverted from the
seismicity rate shown in Figure 4 (solution of equation
(15)). The best ﬁtting Gaussian distribution, with σ0
adjusted, is shown as a blue dashed line. The dotted
green line is the inverted Gaussian distribution with σ0
ﬁxed to its real value.

Figure 8. Same as Figure 4 for the simulated catalog
#4 in Table 1. All ﬁts with the rate-and-state model
are almost superposed for short times. However, at large
times the ﬁt with a Gaussian P (τ ), without constraining
the stress drop (pink line, bottom curve at large times),
deviates signiﬁcantly from the theoretical rate, because
it has a much larger value of ta and σ0.

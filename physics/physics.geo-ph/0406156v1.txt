Abstract.

We report the ﬁrst direct measurements of the very small eﬀect of forced diurnal po-

lar motion, successfully observed on three of our large ring lasers, which now measure
the instantaneous direction of Earth’s rotation axis to a precision of 1 part in 108 when
averaged over a time interval of several hours. Ring laser gyroscopes provide a new vi-
able technique for directly and continuously measuring the position of the instantaneous
rotation axis of the Earth and the amplitudes of the Oppolzer modes. In contrast, the
space geodetic techniques (VLBI, SLR, GPS, etc.) contain no information about the po-
sition of the instantaneous axis of rotation of the Earth, but are sensitive to the com-
plete transformation matrix between the Earth-ﬁxed and inertial reference frame. Fur-
ther improvements of gyroscopes will provide a powerful new tool for studying the Earth’s
interior.

1. Diurnal Polar Motion

The Earth’s angular velocity vector varies in time, both
in direction and magnitude. Changes in magnitude corre-
spond to a variation of the length of day (LOD) with respect
to atomic clocks, amount up to a few milliseconds and con-
sist mainly of various long period and seasonal components
from solid Earth tides and the interaction with atmosphere
and ocean and small diurnal and semi-diurnal terms from
ocean tides.

The direction of the Earth’s rotation axis also varies with
respect to both space- and Earth-ﬁxed reference systems.
The principal component with respect to the Earth-ﬁxed
frame is the well-known Chandler wobble, with an amplitude
of 4–6m at the poles and a period of about 432 days. This is
a free mode of the Earth, i.e. it would still be present in the
absence of the external gravitational forces. It is believed
that the Chandler wobble would decay due to dissipative ef-
fects in the Earth’s interior, were it not continually excited
by seismic activity and by random noise of the atmosphere.
The Chandler wobble is overlaid by daily variations whose
amplitudes are an order of magnitude smaller, some 40–
60cm at the Earth’s surface (c.f. ﬁgure 1) [McClure, 1973],
[Frede et al., 1999]. These Oppolzer terms arise from exter-
nal torques due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon
and Sun. Since the Earth is an oblate spheroid with an
equatorial bulge which is inclined to the plane of the eclip-
tic, the net gravitational torque of the Moon and Sun on
diﬀerent parts of the Earth’s surface does not exactly cancel
out as it would if the Earth were a perfect sphere.

In an Earth-ﬁxed reference system, such as that of a ring
laser ﬁxed to the Earth’s surface, the forced retrograde di-
urnal polar motion is best viewed as a principal mode –
the so-called “tilt-over mode” (K1) – with the period of ex-
actly one sidereal day (23.93447 hours), whose amplitude

is modiﬁed as the angles and distances between the Earth,
Moon and Sun vary over the course of their orbits. The
complete spectrum of nutation modes can be understood as
the beat frequencies of the tilt-over mode with frequencies
corresponding to relevant orbital parameters: half a tropical
month, half a tropical year, the frequency of perigee etc. The
beat periods are clustered around one sidereal day. The O1
and P1 modes, with beat periods of 25.81934 and 24.06589
hours, have the largest amplitudes after the K1 mode, and
arise from the change in angle between the Earth’s equato-
rial bulge and the Moon and Sun respectively. (See [Moritz
et al., 1987] for basic theoretical details.).

The spectrum of Oppolzer terms has the beauty that since
it arises from external gravitational torques, the frequen-
cies are known precisely but the amplitudes, which depend
on the properties of the Earth such as its inertia tensor,
elasticity and liquid core are not so precisely understood,
and could potentially reveal much of geophysical interest.
To date models of the Earth’s interior have been built up
which are broadly consistent with VLBI measurements of
the instantaneous orientation of the Earth’s rotation axis.
However, direct routine measurements of the amplitude of
the Oppolzer terms with ring lasers would open up a new
ﬁeld of geophysical studies. In this paper we report a ﬁrst
step in that direction.

2. The Eﬀect of Polar Motion on Ring
Laser Gyroscopes

Ring lasers measure absolute rotation [Stedman, 1997].
In the experimental set up two laser beams propagate in
opposite directions around a closed path. If the instrument
rotates the eﬀective path-length is slightly shorter for the
counter-rotating beam. In an active laser cavity, as is the
case for our instruments, lasing is achieved when an inte-
gral number of wavelengths circumscribe the ring perimeter.
Since the path length is slightly diﬀerent for the co-rotating
and the counter-rotating beams the lasing frequencies are

B06405

SCHREIBER ET AL.: DIURNAL POLAR MOTION DETECTION BY RING LASERS

also slightly diﬀerent in each case and the beat frequency of
the two laser beams, the Sagnac frequency is readily mea-
surable. For an Earth-ﬁxed rectangular cavity of perimeter
length P , and area A, with normal n the Sagnac frequency
is given by

δf =

n · Ω,

4A
λP

where Ω is the instantaneous angular velocity vector (re-
ferred to an inertial frame), and λ is the wavelength of the
laser beams in the absence of rotation. The Sagnac fre-
quency will vary with: (i) changes in the instantaneous po-
sition of the Earth’s rotation axis and its angular velocity,
which alter Ω; (ii) tilts from solid Earth tides and tidally in-
duced ocean loading changes, which alter the local normal,
n; (iii) any changes to the scaling factor A/P , which could
result from local thermal or pressure induced variations in
the dimensions of the ring laser; and (iv) any changes in the
refractive index seen by each beam in the laser cavity, as
might result from changes in gas composition.

Although diﬀerent mechanisms contribute to changes in
δf , their individual eﬀects can be separated. Firstly, un-
wanted eﬀects from thermal expansion and the like can be
minimised by suitably isolating the ring lasers and by build-
ing ring lasers with the largest possible ratio A/P to increase
their sensitivity. Likewise variation in refractive index is an
engineering design question and while problems such as tiny
cavity leaks may give slow drifts in δf they would not have
strongly periodic signatures. Finally, tilts from solid Earth
and ocean tides can be readily distinguished from diurnal
polar motion, by tiltmeter measurements on the ring laser.
Table 1 summarizes the performance of some of the
largest existing ring lasers. The fourth column represents
the experimentally obtained instrumental resolution (aver-
aging time of 3 hours), while the last column shows the maxi-
mum amplitude of diurnal polar motion (DPM) as measured

at each ring laser site. While the longitude of a ring laser lo-
cation determines the phase of the polar motion signal, the
latitude deﬁnes the projection of the rotation vector onto
the ring laser normal and therefore determines the amount
of the amplitude of the polar motion signal that is mapped
into the ring laser measurements by equation 1.

3. Details of a Diurnal Polar Motion Model

McClure carried out a detailed investigation of diurnal
polar motion, using a purely elastic deformable Earth as
the basic theoretical model [McClure, 1973]. The additional
correction for liquid-core eﬀects has been shown to produce
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences for the motion of the rotation axis
[Wahr, 1981; Brzezi´nski, 1986]. Adopting body–ﬁxed coor-
dinates, the instantaneous position of the rotation axis is
determined as a linear superposition of sinusoidal Oppolzer
modes. By convention, the modes are expressed in terms
of fundamental arguments corresponding to particular or-
bital parameters. Speciﬁcally, the longitude diurnal varia-
tion, ∆ϕ, and the obliquity diurnal variation, ∆ǫ, are given
respectively by

obtained for the mean anomaly of the Sun, the diﬀerence
between the mean longitude of the Moon and the mean lon-
gitude of the ascending node of the lunar orbit, the mean
elongation of the Moon from the Sun and ﬁnally the mean
longitude of the ascending node of the Moon. In all these ex-
pressions, the time t is measured in Julian Centuries of 36525
days of 86400 seconds since J2000. Furthermore, the Green-

and coeﬃcients. We will keep only the largest 6 coeﬃcients,
as all the remaining coeﬃcients together contribute less than
1 milliarcsecond (mas) to the amplitude of polar motion
and are not yet within the resolution obtained with a gyro-
scope. Calculations with these assumptions superimposed
on the oﬃcial International Earth Rotation Service (IERS)
C04 polar motion series [Dick and Richter, 2002] were used
to compute ﬁgure 1. This C04 series refers to the Celestial
Intermediate Pole (CIP) [Capitaine et al., 2002] deﬁned to
be free of diurnal polar motion terms, as opposed to the
instantaneous axis of rotation. One can clearly see the di-
urnal circles of the rotation axis as it progresses through a
larger cycle of the Chandler wobble. The resulting “latitude
oscillations” have two main components with a periodicity
of nearly 24 hours and approximately 14 days. The maxi-
mum amplitude represents 0.02 seconds of arc at the pole.
We wish to point out that besides the here discussed forced
diurnal polar motion there are many more eﬀects that have
subdaily or daily contributions to Earth rotation (e.g. from
atmosphere, ocean). However at the current level of perfor-
mance of our ring laser gyroscope they are not yet observ-
able. This also applies for length of day variations.

4. Direct Observation of Polar Motion by
Large Ring Lasers

The eﬀect of Earth tides and ocean loading as small pe-
riodic variations has already been successfully identiﬁed in
the time series of the Sagnac frequency of the small C-II
ring laser [Schreiber et al., 2003] located in an underground
cavern in Christchurch (New Zealand). An unambiguous de-
tection of polar motion has now been provided by our other
ring lasers, G and UG1, the results from G being the most
accurate and deﬁnitive. G is a semi-monolithic square HeNe
ring laser of 16 m2 area constructed from Zerodur and lo-
cated in a thermally stable underground laboratory at the
Fundamentalstation Wettzell (Germany) [Schreiber et al.,
2001]. The G ring laser was operated for most of the time
in the year 2002. The most stable conditions ever obtained
from any of our large ring lasers were met between July 24
and October 27, corresponding to the days 205 and 300 of
the year 2002. The overall drift of the raw data over the
entire time is as low as 2 mHz or expressed as an relative er-
−6 over 95 days, to our knowledge a world
ror ∆f /f < 6 · 10
record for gyroscope stability.

A section of the observed time series – data taken be-
tween days 270 and 290 – is shown in ﬁgure 2. A constant
value of 348.635 Hz has been subtracted from each measure-
ment. In addition to the raw ring laser data one can ﬁnd
the corresponding tilt signatures from the body tides [Ag-
new, 1997] and the diurnal polar motion [McClure, 1973;
Brzezi´nski, 1986], both converted to the respective variations
of the Sagnac frequency according to equation 1 and oﬀset
by 100 and 180 µHz for better illustration in the diagram.
The residual data set is displayed oﬀset by -100 µHz after
the corrections were applied and shows a good agreement
between the measurements and the models adopted. What

remains is the signature from instrumental drift and some
transient pertubations of still unknown geophysical origin.
We have computed power spectra of ring laser measure-
ments from various available time series of diﬀerent lengths
of 3 diﬀerent ring lasers, C-II, G and UG1. Figure 3 shows
the result. There are 2 groups of signals evident in the
spectrum of the G ring, one at a period around 12 hours
25 minutes and one at a period of around one day. In the
latter group we can identify the K1 and O1 mode contribu-
tions to diurnal polar motion. Their periods of 23.9345 and
25.8195 hours [Frede et al., 1999] correspond to frequencies
of 11.606 and 10.758 µHz. Our measurements yield frequen-
cies of 11.665 and 10.754 µHz, which agree well with theory
within the spectral measurement resolution of 129 nHz. The
P1 mode also has an expected amplitude well within current
resolution, but since its period is very close to that of K1
longer time series are required to separate out its peak in
the spectrum.

The group of higher frequencies is due to variations of
the orientation of the ring laser on the Earth surface in-
duced by solid Earth tides. Again the frequencies of 23.204
and 22.293 µHz are within the resolution of the expected S2
and M2 tides signals. The Earth tides contribute little to
the diurnal terms, because north directed diurnal tidal tilts
are close to zero in mid-latitudes.

The best available time series of UG1 and C-II are
much shorter. Therefore the resolution of their spectra is
not so high.
In addition, C-II shows a signiﬁcant mask-
ing of the diurnal polar motion signal, probably due to
backscatter induced frequency pulling as an instrumental
artefact [Schreiber et al., 1998]. Furthermore, the power
spectral densities obtained for daily polar motion and solid
Earth tides as measured with the C-II ring laser are about
one order of magnitude larger than expected. By contrast,
for UG1 and G this is not the case. We believe that this
is related to the backscatter induced pulling of the Sagnac
frequency which is strong in C-II but negligible for UG1 and
G. Due to long timescale instrumental drift frequencies be-
low 5 µHz (G) or 8 µHz (UG1) were fully cut oﬀ by the
application of an 8th degree Butterworth high pass-ﬁlter.
However, one can clearly identify diurnal polar motion sig-
nals and solid Earth tides in all three instruments. The tidal
signal is stronger at Christchurch due to local ocean loading
on Banks Peninsula.

The larger a ring laser in a given location is, the higher is
its sensitivity to such small signals. Figure 4 shows a time
series from the 367 m2 UG1 which we believe is the largest
working ring laser gyroscope in the world [Dunn et al., 2002].
It dramatically shows one of the advantages of ring lasers,
namely the very high time resolution of the measurements,
making this technique very promising for the study of sub-
daily variations in Earth rotation.
In addition continuous
observations are possible over long time intervals. In con-
trast gyroscopes are local sensors and the data may contain
contributions from local eﬀects which are not yet under-
stood. Indications for this are apparent in ﬁgure 4 as well.
Since the raw data of the UG1 ring laser shows far more
drift than the G ring laser, the data were band-pass ﬁltered
with cut-oﬀ frequencies at 5 and 40 µHz. The computed
polar motion signal was treated in the same way in order to
avoid artefacts from phase shifts caused by the ﬁlter process,
and is superimposed on the measurement data in ﬁgure 4.
The data set has been corrected for Earth tides and ocean
loading [Agnew, 1997]. Local disruptions of the ring laser
setup have not been reduced from the data set. This plot
shows the impressive sensitivity of modern large ring laser
gyroscopes applied to the ﬁeld of geophysics.

5. Summary

The sensitivity and performance of large ring lasers has
improved signiﬁcantly in recent years with the construction
of the C-II, G0, G and UG1 gyroscopes. Today it is possible

to measure variations in the location of the rotational pole
of the Earth to within a few centimetres. As our instru-
ments progressively improve in stability we expect evidence
of further geophysical signals with periods of well over a day
in the future. Since both our ring laser laboratories in Ger-
many and New Zealand are nearly at antipodal points we
unfortunately cannot yet distinguish the diﬀerent eﬀects of
the components ∆ϕ and ∆ǫ of the polar motion. This will
require at least one additional high quality ring laser site
displaced 90 degrees in longitude from our current labora-
tories.

It is important to note that over the past 30 years the the-
oretical model of forced diurnal polar motion has been devel-
oped and is used to reduce these contributions from VLBI
measurements. There are still some uncertainties remain-
ing, since the theoretical models use some simpliﬁcations
to account for a deformable Earth. Large ring laser gy-
roscopes provide a new and independent technology which
can measure the amplitudes and frequencies of the forced
modes of Earth rotation directly and monitor polar motion
to unprecedented high temporal resolution. This eﬀectively
provides a direct probe of the Earth’s moment of inertia.
Therefore we expect that future improvements in ring laser
technology will lead to quantitative improvements in the nu-
tation models themselves, and provide a new tool for study-
ing aspects of the Earth’s interior.

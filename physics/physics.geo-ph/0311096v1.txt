PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

Abstract.

Redistribution of air masses due to atmospheric circulation causes loading

deformation of the Earth’s crust which can be as large as 20 mm for the ver-

tical component and 3 mm for horizontal components. Rigorous computa-

tion of site displacements caused by pressure loading requires knowledge of

the surface pressure ﬁeld over the entire Earth surface. A procedure for com-

puting 3-D displacements of geodetic sites of interest using a 6-hourly pres-

sure ﬁeld from the NCEP numerical weather models and the Ponte and Ray

[2002] model of atmospheric tides is presented. We investigated possible er-

ror sources and found that the errors of our pressure loading time series are

below the 15% level. We validated our model by estimating the admittance

factors of the pressure loading time series using a dataset of 3.5 million VLBI

observations from 1980 to 2002. The admittance factors averaged over all sites

are 0.95 ± 0.02 for the vertical displacement and 1.00 ± 0.07 for the hori-

zontal displacements. For the ﬁrst time horizontal displacements caused by

atmospheric pressure loading have been detected. The closeness of these ad-

mittance factors to unity allows us to conclude that on average our model

quantitatively agrees with the observations within the error budget of the

model. At the same time we found that the model is not accurate for sev-

eral stations which are near a coast or in mountain regions. We conclude that

our model is suitable for routine data reduction of space geodesy observa-

tions.

1. Introduction

At the level of precision of modern space geodetic techniques the Earth’s crust is not

static, but deformable. The Earth’s crust deformation can be caused by processes inside

the Earth, by gravitational forces of external celestial bodies, by changes of the centrifugal

potential, and by various mass loads. Analysis of geodetic observations made from the

deformable surface of our planet requires applying a model of these deformations. The

precision of this model should be comparable with the precision of the measurements,

otherwise unaccounted site position variations due to crust deformation become a fac-

tor which limits the accuracy of measurements, and the potential of geodetic techniques

cannot fully be exploited.

In this paper we focus on the Earth’s crust deformation caused by the load of the

atmosphere. As was found by E. Torricelli in 1644 [Magie, 1963], the atmospheric pressure

is not constant, but has variations at the level of 20–50 mbar. Darwin [1882] was the ﬁrst

who realized that this can cause deformation at the level of several centimeters, and he

proposed a simple model for its computation. However, before the advent of space geodesy,

quasi-random site displacements at the level of centimeters were not directly measurable

and, therefore, there was no necessity to take them into account.

Rapid development of space geodetic techniques in the 1980-s made it feasible to try

to detect atmospheric pressure loading signal from the measurements of site positions.

Trubytsyn and Makalkin [1976] and later Rabel and Zschau [1985], Rabel and Schuh [1986]

and van Dam and Wahr [1987] made quantitative assessments of the impact of passing

cyclones and anticyclones on measurements of site positions assuming that the pressure

distribution in cyclones or anticyclones can be described by a simple mathematical model.

Manabe et al. [1991] tried to ﬁnd a correlation between predicted atmospheric pressure loa-

ding and the time series of site position determined from very long baseline interferometry

(VLBI) observations during 1984–1989 at several stations, but had to acknowledge that

“the observationally determined vertical displacements is not explainable as being caused

by the atmospheric loading, since the dispersion of the observed vertical displacements is

too large”. Three years later van Dam and Herring [1994a] and independently MacMillan

and Gipson [1994] succeeded in detecting atmospheric pressure loading signal using more

sophisticated approaches. MacMillan and Gipson [1994] estimated coeﬃcients of linear

regression between vertical site displacements and local pressure using VLBI data. They

found that these coeﬃcients for the majority of sites are in reasonable agreement with

the coeﬃcients derived by Manabe et al. [1991], and that applying an empirical model

based on the regression between vertical site position and local pressure improves base-

line length repeatability. van Dam and Herring [1994a], hereafter referred as VDH, used

another approach. They analyzed the reduction of variance of the estimates of baseline

lengths derived from analysis of the same VLBI dataset. They found that the reduction of

variance is consistent with the hypothesis that only approximately 60% of the computed

pressure loading contribution is present in the VLBI length determination. Applying the

same technique to global positioning system (GPS) data allowed van Dam et al. [1994b] to

conclude that 57% of the pressure loading signal is present in the baseline length residuals.

Although the presence of atmospheric pressure loading signal was conﬁrmed in observa-

tions, modeling this signal did not come into practice for routine data reduction. First, a

rigorous computation of displacements caused by mass loading requires handling a gigan-

tic volume of information and enormous processor power. Second, there was no certainty

D R A F T

D R A F T

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

X - 5

whether the model is correct. Results of VDH and van Dam et al. [1994b] mean that ob-

servations did not conﬁrm quantitatively the atmosphere pressure loading model. Without

solving this discrepancy, applying the atmosphere pressure loading model for processing

routine observations is not warranted.

There are several factors that motivated us to re-visit this topic. First, the National

Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis project [Kalnay et al., 1996]

now provides a continuous, uniform dataset of surface pressure on a 2◦.5×2◦.5 grid with a 6

hour resolution for more than 40 years which was not available a decade ago. Second, rapid

development of high speed networks and processor power makes it possible to retrieve and

process voluminous meteorological data assimilation models in almost real time. Third,

the accuracy of geodetic observations has increased considerably during the last ten years,

which has improved our ability to detect subtle Earth’s crust motions.

The objective of our study was to develop a procedure of computing displacements

caused by atmospheric pressure loading which is suitable for routine analysis of geodetic

observations, and to compare these time series of pressure loading with a dataset of

all VLBI observations from 1980 to 2002. The purpose of this comparison is to get a

quantitative measure of the agreement between the model and observations, and infer

whether the model is correct or wrong. In order to do it, we thoroughly examine the error

budget and on the basis of these estimates compute the expectation of the deviation of the

observations from the model. Our goal is to determine whether the observations deviate

from the expectation or not. If the agreement test deviates from the expectation at a

statistically signiﬁcant level, this means that either there is an error in computations or

there is a fundamental ﬂaw in our understanding of the physics of the phenomena under

consideration. Then the model must be rejected at this point.

If the outcome of the

statistical test is within the predicted range based on known deﬁciencies of the model,

this means that the procedure for computation of the atmosphere pressure loading can be

accepted for routine reduction of observations.

In the second section of the paper we describe our method of computing site displace-

ments caused by pressure loading and assess the error budget of our calculations. We

re-analyzed a dataset of 3.5 million VLBI observations and performed several statisti-

cal tests of agreement between the model of pressure loading and the observations. The

method of data analysis is described in section 3. The results of the VLBI data analy-

sis are discussed in section 4. Concluding remarks are given in section 5. An eﬃcient

procedure for computing a time series of pressure loading is outlined in the Appendix.

2. Computation of Displacements Using Meteorological Models

According to Farrell [1972] the vertical displacement at a station of coordinates ~r in-

duced by surface pressure variations ∆P (~r ′, t) is equal to:

ur(~r, t) =

∆P (~r ′, t) GR(ψ) cos ϕ′dλ′dϕ′

f , a and g0 are the universal constant of gravitation, the mean Earth’s radius and the mean

surface gravity as deﬁned in PREM [Dziewonski and Andersen, 1981], ϕ′ is the geocentric

latitude, and λ′ is the longitude. ψ is the angular distance between the station with

coordinates ~r and the pressure source with coordinates ~r ′. Pn is the Legendre polynomial

of degree n.

The horizontal displacement is computed this way:

where ~q(~r, ~r ′) is the unit vector originating from the station, tangential to the Earth’s

method of numerical computation of Green’s functions is presented by Farrell [1972].

We model the oceanic response to atmospheric pressure forcing as an inverted barometer

(IB):

∆Pa + ∆Pw − ∆ ¯Po = 0

where ∆Pa is the variation of local atmosphere pressure, ∆Pw is the local variation of the

ocean bottom pressure due to induced sea level change, and ∆ ¯Po is the mean atmosphere

pressure over the world’s oceans:

which is applied uniformly at the sea ﬂoor [van Dam and Wahr, 1987]. This term is

introduced in equation 5 in order to enforce conservation of ocean mass. Thus, the total

ocean bottom pressure, ∆Pa + ∆Pw, is described by equation 6. It has been shown in

numerous studies (see, for example, [Tierney et al., 2000]) that this model adequately

describes the sea height variations for periods longer than 5–20 days. However, the ocean

response signiﬁcantly deviates from the IB hypothesis for shorter periods [Wunsch and

Stammer, 1997].

Since ∆ ¯Po is zero over the land and depends only on time over the world’s oceans, it is

convenient to split integrals 1 and 3 into a sum of integrals over the ocean and over the

continental surface. In our computation we use the land-sea mask from the FES99 [Lef`evre

et al., 2002] ocean tidal model with a 0◦.25 spatial resolution. A practical algorithm for the

computation of site displacements caused by atmospheric pressure loading is presented in

the Appendix.

Since the NCEP Reanalysis numerical weather models have a time resolution of 6 hours,

the semidiurnal (S2) atmospheric tide induced by solar heating cannot be modeled cor-

rectly, because its frequency corresponds exactly to the Nyquist frequency. The diurnal

(S1) atmospheric tide is somewhat distorted as well, because of the presence of the ter-

diurnal signal, which is folded into the diurnal frequency due to sampling. This problem

was investigated by van den Dool et al. [1997] in detail, who proposed a temporal inter-

polation procedure which to some extent allows one to overcome the problem. Based on

this approach Ponte and Ray [2002] recently developed a gridded global model of the S1

and S2 atmospheric tides with a spatial resolution of 1◦.125 ×1◦.125. For reasons discussed

by these authors, we believe their model better represents the atmospheric tides than the

diurnal and semidiurnal signal which is present in the NCEP Reanalysis model. Using

these maps we have computed amplitudes and phases of the loading caused by diurnal

and semidiurnal atmospheric tides for VLBI and satellite laser ranging (SLR) sites.

For each grid point we have estimated four parameters using least squares (LSQ): mean

pressure, sine and cosine amplitude of the S1 signal, and cosine amplitude of the S2 signal

in the surface pressure ﬁeld over the time period from 1980 to 2002. This four-parameter

model is subtracted at each point of the grid from the NCEP Reanalysis pressure ﬁeld

before evaluation of the convolution integral. Thus, our time series has zero mean and no

signal at S1 and S2 frequencies. The total loading is the sum of the time series and the

harmonic model of the S1 and S2 loading caused by atmospheric tides.

2.1. Characteristics of the Atmospheric Pressure Loading Displacements

In ﬁgures 1 and 2 we show examples of time series of the modeled displacements for the

period 2000–2003 and their power spectrum at the Wettzell and Hartrao stations respec-

tively. These stations are representative of mid-latitude and equatorial inland stations.

All station displacements show signiﬁcant narrow-band diurnal and semidiurnal signals.

The displacements for low-latitude stations are characterized by a strong wide-band annual

and semi-annual signals and relatively weak signal for periods below 10 days, except strong

peaks at the S1 and S2 frequencies. Mid-latitude stations show just the opposite behavior.

For the mid-latitude regions circulation of low and high pressure structures with periods

of 5–10 days is typical. These periods are also at the edge of the validity of the IB model

for describing the oceanic response to atmospheric pressure forcing.

The rms of vertical and horizontal displacements is presented in columns 4 and 5 of

table 1. Figure 3 shows an example of the temporal autocorrelation function for the

vertical displacement for the mid-latitude station Algopark. The autocorrelation rapidly

drops to the level less than 0.2 for time intervals longer than 2 days. The smoothed spatial

presented in ﬁgure 4. We see that the correlation for baselines shorter than 1000 km is

ﬁgure 4

very high, typically greater than 0.9, and only for baselines longer than 3000 km does it

drop below the level of 0.2 .

2.2. Error Budget

There are four major sources of errors in the computation of site displacements caused

by atmospheric pressure loading: 1) errors in the Green’s functions, 2) errors in the

land-sea mask, 3) errors in the pressure ﬁeld, and 4) mismodeling the ocean response to

atmospheric pressure forcing.

The Green’s functions are computed for a SNREI Earth model adopting PREM elastic

parameters. Thus, we neglect the eﬀects induced by Earth’s anelasticity and ellipticity.

The diﬀerences between our Green’s functions and Green’s functions for an anelastic Earth

model (see for example Pagiatakis [1990] or Okubo and Tsuji [2001]) are typically below

1–2%. The eﬀect of the Earth’s ellipticity is of the order of magnitude of the Earth’s

ﬂattening, i.e. 0.3%.

Since the 2◦.5 spatial resolution of the NCEP Reanalysis surface pressure ﬁeld is not

suﬃcient to correctly represent the coastline, we chose a land-sea mask with a 0◦.25 res-

olution from the FES99 [Lef`evre et al., 2002] ocean tidal model. The land-sea mask and

the station distribution are shown in ﬁgure 5. We assume that enclosed and small semi-

ﬁgure 5

enclosed seas (such as Baltic, Black, Red, Caspian Seas and Persian Gulf) respond to

atmospheric pressure forcing as a ”non-inverted barometer”, i.e. atmospheric pressure

variations are fully transmitted to the sea ﬂoor.

In order to evaluate the eﬀect of the

errors in the land-sea mask, we computed the time series of atmospheric pressure loading

with both the 0◦.25 and 0◦.50 land-sea masks. The diﬀerences between these two estimates

D R A F T

D R A F T

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

X - 11

are typically about 5%. It is worth mentioning that the diﬀerence between the loading

estimates with the 2◦.5 and 0◦.25 land-sea masks can reach 10% for the vertical component

and 30% for the horizontal components, even for a station like Wettzell (Germany) which

is 500 km from the coast.

Another source of error in our computations are errors in the surface pressure ﬁeld from

the NCEP Reanalysis. One way to compute this is to compare directly the diﬀerence

between the model and surface pressure observations. Velicogna et al. [2001] presented

estimates of the rms diﬀerences for two diﬀerent regions (Arabic Peninsula and United

States). On the basis of their estimates we conclude that the errors of the NCEP surface

pressure ﬁeld on these selected areas are at the level of 5%.

Another measure of possible errors in the surface pressure ﬁeld model is the diﬀerence

between two variants of NCEP numerical weather models: the NCEP Reanalysis and the

NCEP Operational Final Analysis, although these two models are obviously not indepen-

dent. The NCEP Operational Final Analysis models is an improved version with respect

to an earlier model NCEP Reanalysis. The improved horizontal (1◦ instead of 2◦.5) and

vertical (42 layers instead of 28) resolution allows a better modeling of atmospheric dy-

namics. We computed station displacements due to atmospheric pressure loading using

the NCEP Operational dataset with a spatial resolution of 1◦.0 for the period from April

2002 to January 2003. The rms of the diﬀerences between the vertical and horizontal

displacements computed with the NCEP Reanalysis and the NCEP Operational data are

shown in the 6th and 7th columns of table 1. Correlations between the diﬀerences and

the modeled signal are shown in columns 8, 9. The mean error is about 10% for the

vertical and horizontal components.

It is noticeable that the diﬀerences are larger for

D R A F T

D R A F T

X - 12

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

stations enclosed by mountains, for example, Santiago. This is due to the fact that the

2◦.5 or even 1◦.0 spatial resolution of the NCEP Reanalysis and Operational datasets is

not suﬃcient to model the topographic variations in mountainous areas and, therefore,

the surface pressure variations. Our results are similar to conclusions made by Velicogna

et al. [2001]. The precision of computation of pressure loading displacements is worse for

mountainous stations.

In order to evaluate the errors caused by mismodeling of the ocean response, we

compared ocean bottom pressure variations, as well as the induced loading eﬀects,

from two runs of the Coupled Large-scale Ice Ocean (CLIO) general circulation mo-

del [Goosse and Fichelet, 1999]; the ﬁrst one is forced by atmospheric pressure, sur-

face winds and heat ﬂuxes [de Viron et al., 2002], and the other one is forced only

by surface winds and heat ﬂuxes, i.e. assuming an IB response. The diﬀerences be-

tween these two runs can therefore be interpreted as the departure of the ocean re-

sponse from the IB assumption. We also validated the bottom pressure changes mod-

eled by CLIO with measurements from the Global Undersea Pressure (GLOUP) data set

[http://www.pol.ac.uk/psmslh/gloup/gloup.html] and found that the CLIO model

agrees with the measurements of the bottom pressure at the level of 20%. We show in

the 10th and 11th columns of table 1 the ratio of the rms of these diﬀerences to the rms

of our atmospheric loading series with the IB model for all stations, as well as a mean

value of this ratio. Correlations between the diﬀerences and modeled signal are shown in

columns 12 and 13. Thus, the mean vertical and horizontal errors are below 10% and 20%

respectively. As expected, these values are higher for island stations (f.e., Kokee, Mk-

vlba) or stations close to the coasts (Richmond, Hobart26, etc.), where the atmospheric

loading to be 15%.

3. Validation of the Model Using VLBI Observations

We selected VLBI for validation of our time series of atmospheric pressure loading.

Each of the three main space geodetic techniques, GPS, SLR and VLBI, has its own

advantages and disadvantages, although in general they are quite competitive. We chose

VLBI because of the maturity of the VLBI data analysis technique. Complete re-analysis

of the whole set of VLBI observations takes about a couple of hours on rather a modest

computer. Therefore, the consistency of reduction models and parameter estimation can

easily be enforced. These factors make VLBI attractive for investigating tiny eﬀects like

atmospheric pressure loading.

3.1. Observations

All dual-band Mark-3/Mark-4/K-4 VLBI observations carried out under various

geodetic and astrometric programs from 1979 to the present are available on-line at

the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) Data Center at

http://ivscc.gsfc.nasa.gov [Vandenberg, 1999]. The VLBI data set has substantial

spatial and time inhomogeneity. Typically, observations are made in sessions with a dura-

tion of about 24 hours. Observations were sporadic in the early 80s, but in January 1984

a regular VLBI campaign for the determination of EOP started ﬁrst with 5-day intervals,

D R A F T

July 31, 2013, 4:57am

D R A F T

X - 14

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

from May 1993 with weekly intervals, and from 1997 twice per week. In addition to the

observations dedicated to EOP measurements, various other observing campaigns were

running. On average 150 sessions per year have been observed since 1984.

In total 144 stations participated in observations, although a majority of them observed

only during short campaigns. The stations which participated in more than 20 000 ob-

servations for more than three years were used for analysis. 46 stations satisﬁed these

criteria. Four stations which participated in the Key Stone Project (KSP) [Takahashi

et al., 2000], Kashim11, Koganei, Miura, Tateyama, were excluded since they observed

mainly in a small local network, as well as two other stations, Crimea, because it had

bad performance, and Ylow7296, since its sensitivity was too low. Only observations on

the baselines between the 40 strong selected stations were used, and other observations

(∼6%) were discarded. Sessions with less than 3 strong stations were discarded entirely.

3073 sessions from April 1980 to December 2002 with more than 3.5 million observations

remained, and they were used in the analysis.

The number of participating stations in each individual session varies from 2 to 20,

although 4–7 is a typical number. No station participated in all sessions, but every

station participated in sessions with many diﬀerent networks. All networks have common

nodes and, therefore, are tied together. Networks vary signiﬁcantly, but more than 70%

of them have a size exceeding the Earth’s radius.

3.2. Choice of Parameterization

The scatter of daily estimates of site positions is greater by a factor of 2–5 than the

rms of atmospheric pressure loading displacements. Therefore, we cannot directly see the

signal in the site position time series. Besides, in order to resolve rank deﬁciency of the

D R A F T

D R A F T

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

X - 15

problem of simultaneous adjustment of coordinates of all site and EOP, net-rotation and

net-translation constraints should be applied or an equivalent technique should be used.

As a result adjustments of site positions become linearly dependent. Since only a small

number of stations participates in a typical VLBI experiment, the inﬂuence of position

variations of other observing stations of the network on position variations of a station of

interest is not diluted to a negligible level. It makes the interpretation of daily VLBI site

position time series uncertain.

One of the ways to assess validity of the model is to compute two time series of baseline

lengths: the ﬁrst with applying the atmospheric pressure loading model and the second

without applying the model. Baseline lengths are invariant with respect to a rotation

and translation and, therefore, net-translation and net-rotation constraints do not aﬀect

them. We introduce the reduction of variance coeﬃcient R:

R =

∆σ2 + σ2
m
2 σ2
m

(7)

where ∆σ2 is the diﬀerence between the mean square of baseline length residuals before

and after applying the model, and σm is the variance of the signal in the model.

If

the model is perfect and the signal under consideration is not correlated with another

unmodeled eﬀects, the coeﬃcient is 1. If the baseline length series does not contain the

signal coherent with the model at all, then applying the model increases the variance by

the amount of the variance of the signal in that model, and the coeﬃcient of reduction of

variance is 0. We should emphasize importance of the assumption of the lack of correlation

between the pressure loading signal and noise: we can extract the signal which is below

the noise level if, and only if, some additional information about the noise is exploited.

The validity of this assumption is based on the fact that as can bee seen in ﬁgures 1

D R A F T

July 31, 2013, 4:57am

D R A F T

X - 16

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

and 2, the spectrum of the atmosphere pressure loading at frequencies below one day is

ﬂat, except for a peak at the annual frequency for some stations. Thus, the atmospheric

pressure loading can be considered to some degree as a stochastic Gaussian process. The

spectrum of the VLBI residuals is also ﬂat. Therefore, our condition of lack of correlation

between the atmosphere pressure loading series and residual unmodeled eﬀects is fulﬁlled

if an unmodeled contribution to VLBI delay and pressure loading are independent.

Although this approach gives us a quantitative measure of the adequacy of the model,

it has some disadvantages. It lets us determine only the reduction of variance coeﬃcients

for the projection of the diﬀerence of the site displacements vectors on the baseline vector

instead of the coeﬃcients for each site and each component independently.

Another approach is to represent the atmospheric pressure loading signal as a product

A · am, where am is the modeled signal, and to estimate directly from the VLBI time

delays the unknown parameter A which hereafter we call admittance factor between the

modeled signal and the observables. It can easily be veriﬁed that if A is the only estimated

parameter and the modeled signal is not correlated with an unmodeled contribution to

the observable, then the expectation of the LSQ estimate of the admittance factor, E( ˆA),

is

E( ˆA) = ρ

σl
σm

(8)

where ρ is the correlation coeﬃcient between modeled and true atmospheric pressure

loading, and σl is the variance of the true pressure loading. Under the same assumption

the reduction of variance ∆σ2 =

σ2
m and therefore, the coeﬃcient of reduction

(cid:19)
of variance R is equal to E( ˆA). If other parameters are adjusted in addition to A, this

property is preserved at the level of correlations between ˆA and the estimates of other

parameters. The admittance factor A shows how much of the power of the modeled signal

is present in the observables.

3.3. Estimation Model

We made solutions of two classes: global solutions, in which we estimated the positions

and velocities of all sites over the entire data set, and baseline solutions, in which we

estimated site positions for each VLBI experiment independently using ionosphere free

linear combination of group delays at S and X bands. Estimated parameters were split into

two classes: basic parameters, which are usually adjusted in processing VLBI experiments,

and speciﬁc parameters of interest. Basic parameters belong to one of the three groups:

— global (over the entire data set): positions of 511 primary sources and proper mo-

tions of 79 sources.

clock oﬀsets.

— local (over each session): pole coordinates and their rates, UT1, UT1 rate; positions

of other sources, azimuthal troposphere path delay gradients for all stations and their

rates, station-dependent clocks modeled by second order polynomials, baseline-dependent

— segmented (over 0.33–1.0 hours): coeﬃcients of a linear spline which models at-

mospheric path delay (0.33 hour segment) and clock function (1 hour segment) for each

station. The estimates of clock function absorb uncalibrated instrumental delays in the

data acquisition system.

The rate of change of atmospheric path delay and clock function between two ad-

jacent segments was constrained to zero with weights reciprocal to 40 psec/hour and

2 · 10−14 sec/sec respectively in order to stabilize solutions. No-net-translation and no-

net-rotation constraints were imposed on the adjustments of site positions and velocities

as well as no-net-rotation constraints were imposed on adjustments of source positions in

order to solve the LSQ problem of incomplete rank.

A pair of baseline solutions was made with only basic parameters estimated and station

positions treated as local parameters. In reference solution B1 the atmospheric pressure

loading time series was not applied; in solution B2 the contribution due to the model of

atmospheric pressure loading was added to the theoretical model of the observables.

In solutions G1, G5, G6 and G7 the list of global parameters included site positions,

site velocities and overall admittance factors for the Up, East and North components of

the modeled atmospheric pressure loading signal for all sites combined. In solution G2 we

estimated the set of the admittance factors for the Up, East and North components for

each station independently, and other parameters were the same as in the G1 solution.

It should be noted that unlike estimation of positions of all stations, estimation of

the Up, East and North admittance factors for all stations of a global network does not

result in a rank deﬁciency. A partial derivative of time delay τ with respect to the

admittance factor of the i’th station is given by

=

ami, where ri is a vector of

station coordinates. As was shown in ﬁgure 3, the correlation between the atmosphere

pressure loading at diﬀerent stations is less than 0.1 at distances greater than 4000 km.

3.4. Theoretical Model

The computation of theoretical time delays, with some exceptions, generally follows the

procedure outlined in the IERS Conventions [McCarthy, 1996] and described in more detail

by Sovers et al. [1998]. The GOT00 model [Ray, 1999] of diurnal and semidiurnal ocean

tides, the NAO99 model [Matsumoto et al., 2000] of ocean zonal tides, the equilibrium

model of the pole tide and the tide with period of 18.6 years were used for the computation

of displacements due to ocean loading. The hydrology model of Milly and Shmakin [2002a]

was used for the computation of displacements due to hydrology loading (D.S. MacMillan

and J.-P. Boy, Eﬀect of mass loading signals on crustal displacements measured by VLBI,

manuscript in preparation; D.S MacMillan, personal communication 2003). The empirical

model of high frequency Earth orientation parameters derived from analysis of the VLBI

data [Petrov, 2000a] and the IERS96 semi-empirical nutation expansion were used. The

Niell [1996] mapping functions were used for modeling and estimating the tropospheric

path delay. The displacement of the reference point of a VLBI station due to thermal

expansion of the antenna was not modeled. Although Nothnagel et al. [1995] proposed

a model for an antenna’s thermal expansion, attempts to validate this model were not

successful. We did not include the model of non-tideal ocean loading, because this eﬀect

⇐= C1

is one order of magnitude smaller than the atmosphere pressure loading, and it has not

been fully investigated. It will be considered in a future paper.

4. Discussion

4.1. Analysis of Global Admittance Factors

Table 3 shows admittance factors determined in solution G1. The uncertainties of the

Table 3

results were derived by propagating the group delay errors. These errors were computed

on the basis of the signal to noise ratio of the cross correlation function of the recorded

signal from the receivers and the empirical baseline-dependent reweighting parameters

which, being added in quadrature to the uncertainties of group delays, made the χ2/f of

the postﬁt residuals close to unity.

In addition to that, the formal uncertainties were

scaled by a factor of 1.5. Numerous tests of splitting the dataset into subsets in time and

in space showed that the VLBI formal uncertainties are underestimated by the factor of

1.5. The origin of this discrepancy is not completely understood, but there are indications

that it may be caused by fringe phase variations due to instrumental errors [Petrov, 2000b].

Above we showed the estimates of the rms of possible errors in our computation of

atmospheric pressure loading and their correlations with the modeled signal. Assuming

that the diﬀerent error sources a) are not correlated with each other, b) are small with

respect to the signal, we can present the expectation of the admittance factor in this form:

E(A) = 1 −

(9)

X

X Xi6=j

where k is the ratio of the rms of errors to the rms of the modeled signal, r is the correlation

←− C6

between the error and modeled signal. The summing is done over all considered sources

⇐= C6

of errors.

Using numerical values for ri and ki listed in table 2, we evaluate the expectation of

A: 0.90 . Our estimates of the admittance factors are close to this value. This means

that the known deﬁciency of the model is suﬃcient to explain the small deviation of the

estimates of the global admittance factors from 1.

Since the typical spectrum of atmospheric pressure loading shows peaks at semi-diurnal

(1.46 · 10−4 rad/s), diurnal (7.29 · 10−5), semi-annual (3.98 · 10−7 rad/s) and annual fre-

quencies (1.99 · 10−7 rad/s) (ﬁgures 1–2), we would like to see how applying the atmo-

spheric pressure loading model aﬀects residual harmonic site position variations at these

frequencies. In order to assess this eﬀect, we made two solutions, G3 and G4, and es-

timated the sine and cosine amplitudes of position variations of all sites at 32 tidal fre-

quencies, including these four frequencies with noticeable atmospheric pressure loading

signal. Atmospheric pressure loading was applied in solution G4, but was not in solution

G3. Amplitudes at the frequencies of diurnal, semidiurnal and long period bands where

no tidal signal is expected were estimated as well in order to calibrate the uncertainties

of the results. The ratio of the weighted sum of squares of the residual amplitudes over

⇐= C2

Table 4
←− C2

all stations at the speciﬁc frequency to its mathematical expectation, P, was used as a

measure of the power of the residual signal. In the absence of the signal these statistics

should be less than 1.25 at the 95% conﬁdence level. Therefore, large values of P which

exceed this limit indicate the presence of the residual signal. This technique is explained

in more details by Petrov and Ma [2002].

Table 4 shows the estimates of P for each of the four frequencies of interest. We

see that applying the model of atmospheric pressure loading reduces the amplitude of

the residual signal at semi-diurnal and semi-annual frequencies, but noticeably increases

the amplitude at the annual frequency.

In all cases the power of remaining residual

signal is still signiﬁcant. This table shows us that the atmosphere pressure loading is

not the dominating source of observed residual harmonic site position variations at these

frequencies.

The presence of the narrow-band residual signal to some degree violates the assumption

of lack of correlations which was put at the basis of the agreement test. Two harmonic

signals may be independent and correlated.

In order to investigate the eﬀect of the

atmospheric pressure loading signal at the annual frequency, the frequency with the largest

harmonic signal, we passed the pressure loading time series through a narrow-band ﬁlter

with a passing window around the annual frequency:

[1.79 · 10−7, 2.19 · 10−7] rad/s. We

made two solutions, G5 in which we estimated the global admittance factor of the annual

constituent of the atmospheric pressure loading and solution G6 in which we estimated

D R A F T

July 31, 2013, 4:57am

D R A F T

X - 22

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

the global admittance factor with the signal at the annual band removed. The results

are presented in table 3. The admittance factor in solution G5 increased by 3%. It gives

us a measure of the distortion of the statistical tests caused by unaccounted correlations

between the annual narrow-band unmodeled signal and atmospheric pressure loading.

Similar results were reported by VDH who noted that removal of the annual signal from

the atmospheric pressure loading increased variance reduction of the baseline length series.

The fact that modeling atmospheric pressure loading increases the level of the residual

signal at annual frequency does not necessarily mean that the model is wrong. If two

anticorrelated signals contribute to the observables, then including the model of only

one of the signals in the procedure of reduction of observations may result in increasing

variance, even if the model is perfect. We know that various phenomena may contribute

to the annual site position variation, such as hydrological signal, non-tidal ocean loading,

thermal antenna deformation, mismodeling troposphere path delay, etc, and atmospheric

pressure loading is not the greatest contributor. It should be noted that this means that

a reduction of the variance coeﬃcient and an admittance factor cannot be considered as

a valid test of goodness of the model in this speciﬁc case.

We should acknowledge that currently we are unable to test directly whether the annual

constituent of the atmospheric pressure loading signal is modeled correctly or not. It will

be possible in the future when a complete model of site position variations will be built

and the power of the residual signal will become less than the power of annual pressure

loading signal. Although attempts to model seasonal eﬀects show certain improvement

[Dong et al., 2002], we are still far from a solution of this problem.

unity for each individual station. Table 5 shows the estimates of the admittance factors

Table 5

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

X - 23

At the same time the admittance factor for the vertical displacements is close to unity at

the level of measurement noise for the wide-band component of the modeled displacements

due to atmosphere pressure loading after subtraction of the annual component. It provides

us indirect evidence that we have modeled atmosphere pressure loading correctly at the

annual frequency as well, since the Green’s function and land-sea mask are frequency

independent, and our estimate of the error budget set the upper limit of possible seasonal

errors of the atmosphere pressure ﬁeld.

4.2. Analysis of Admittance Factors for Individual Stations.

Although we concluded in the previous section that the average admittance factor is

very close to unity, it does not necessarily mean that the admittance factors are close to

from the G2 solution. The estimates with the formal uncertainties greater than 0.5 are

omitted in the table. It is not surprising that the admittance factor of the Kokee station

is far from unity, even negative, since the station is located on an island in the middle of

the Paciﬁc ocean. It is more surprising that the admittance factors at the Hn-vlba and

Westford stations are so diﬀerent, since the distance between these stations is only 54 km

and, indeed, the time series of the pressure loading are very similar. We suspect some

problem with data at the station of Hn-vlba. Low admittance at the La-vlba and Pietown

stations located in mountainous regions may be explained by greater errors in the model

of surface pressure. We do not have explanation of the negative admittance factor at the

station of Ov-vlba. Another peculiarity is the anomalously high admittance factors at

the Seshan25 and Tsukub32 stations. It is known that the response of the Yellow Sea

to tidal forcing is ampliﬁed by 10 times, and a signiﬁcant non-linear M4 tide is observed

[Lef`evre et al., 2000]. We can expect that the response to atmospheric forcing will be also

substantially non-linear and not consistent with the IB hypothesis.

4.3. Analysis of Reduction of Variance Coeﬃcients

In order to compare our results with the early VDH paper, we performed our analysis

in a manner similar to that used in the analysis of those authors. We computed the time

series of baseline lengths in the B1 and B2 solutions. A linear model was ﬁt in the series

with discontinuities at epochs of seismic events for several stations. The weighted root

mean square of residual baseline lengths was computed for all baselines with more than

100 sessions for both the B1 and B2 solutions. 69 baselines satisfy this criterion. The

coeﬃcients of reduction of variance were computed using baseline length variances.

The histogram of the distribution of the coeﬃcients of reduction of variance is presented

in ﬁgure 6. The weighted mean value ¯R over 69 baselines is 0.97 ± 0.04 . For the com-

ﬁgure 6

putation of the uncertainty of the mean value we used the variance of R which can easily

be derived from the results presented in the appendix of VDH:

var(R) =

2 − σ2

where σ2

⇐= C3

B2 respectively, σ2

m is the mean square of the modeled baseline changes with respect to

the mean value computed over the period of time of VLBI observation, N is the number

of observing sessions.

VDH analyzed 22 baselines for the period 1979 to 1992. They reported a much lower

value of the reduction of variance coeﬃcient, 0.62, which means that 38% of the power

of the signal in their series of atmospheric pressure loading is not present in the VLBI

data.

In order to check whether the diﬀerences may be due to changes in the quality

of VLBI data collected after 1992 we restricted our calculations to exactly the same set

of observations and baselines used by VDH. We got 1.10 ± 0.10 for the coeﬃcient of

reduction of variance for this case. It deviates at the 3σ level from the value reported by

VDH. The diﬀerences in our analysis technique of VLBI observations and the technique

of VDH are not signiﬁcant enough to explain this large discrepancy. So, the diﬀerences

in the reduction of variance coeﬃcients come from the diﬀerences between the series of

the atmospheric pressure loading displacements. First, the predicted baseline loading

⇐= C5

eﬀects of VDH and van Dam et al. [1994b] suﬀered from the problem that they have the

wrong sign for the horizontal deformation in the North direction (T. van Dam personal

communication, 2003). Second, we used the NCEP Reanalysis model, but VDH used

←− C5

an older model: the National Meteorological Center operational model with a 12 hour

resolution. Third, we used a land-sea mask with a resolution of 0◦.25 × 0◦.25 — ten times

better then the resolution of the surface pressure model. As shown in section 2.2, this

diﬀerence alone can cause an error in the vertical displacements as large as 10%. Fourth,

we used a diﬀerent numerical algorithm for computing the convolution integral.

4.4. Application of the Pressure Loading Model to Data Reduction

In the past, several authors recommended ﬁnding the linear regression of the vertical

atmospheric pressure loading and local surface pressure and using this simple model in op-

erational data analysis. Rabel and Zschau [1985] warned that since “the magnitude of the

displacements is critically dependent on the spatial extension of the pressure distribution,

[. . . ] there cannot be any unique regression coeﬃcient between local displacements and

local air pressure changes which could be used to correct geodynamics measurements for

D R A F T

D R A F T

X - 26

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

air-pressure-induced surface displacements”. However, this simple model was used in the

20th century. In order to evaluate the errors of this approach, we computed coeﬃcients

of linear regression between the 22 year long time series of the displacements caused by

atmospheric pressure loading and local pressure at the station obtained by interpolation

of the NCEP surface pressure ﬁeld. Using these regression coeﬃcients we computed a

synthetic time series of the pressure loading for each station and estimated the admit-

tance factors of these time series in solution G7. The results are shown in table 3. We see

that the simple regression model works surprisingly well for vertical components. This

test shows that the amount of the power of the signal which is present in the model, but

is not present in the data, is increased from 5% to 12% when a regression model is used.

Currently, there is no need to resort to a simpliﬁed linear regression. Numerical weather

models are available on-line promptly, and a computation of a 20 years long series of

pressure loading for all VLBI and SLR sites takes only several days at a personal computer

using the eﬃcient algorithm presented in the Appendix.

Applying atmospheric pressure loading in a procedure of data reduction causes a small

change in the resulting terrestrial reference frame: the maximum site position change

among the stations which observed one year or longer is 2 mm, the velocity change is

typically below 0.1 mm/yr with the maximum change of 0.4 mm/yr, and the scale factor

is increased by 0.05 ± 0.02 ppb. Taking into account the horizontal component of the

displacement due to atmospheric pressure loading causes rms diﬀerences in the estimates of

polar motion and UT1 at the level of 100 prad and diﬀerences in the estimates of nutation

angles with an rms of 30 prad. The uncertainties of the EOP derived from processing

daily VLBI sessions are currently at the level of 200–400 prad. Therefore, omission of the

D R A F T

D R A F T

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

X - 27

horizontal atmospheric pressure loading is currently not a signiﬁcant source of noise in

the estimates of the EOP.

5. Conclusions

We found that vertical and horizontal displacements caused by atmospheric pressure

loading currently can be computed with errors less than 15% by convolution of the surface

pressure ﬁeld from the NCEP Reanalysis model with Green’s functions. Our analysis of

VLBI observations of 40 strong stations for the time period from 1980 till 2002 demon-

strates that on average only 5% of the power of the modeled vertical pressure loading

signal, 16% of horizontal signal and 3% of the signal in baseline lengths is not found

in VLBI data. Thus, all discrepancies between the observations and the model can be

explained by known deﬁciencies of the model.

Admittance factors of the time series of pressure loading vertical displacements without

the annual constituent do not deviate from unity by more than the formal uncertainty. It

means that at the conﬁdence level of 5% the modeled signal is completely recovered from

the VLBI observables. This estimate sets the upper limit of possible errors in Green’s

functions: 4% for the radial Green’s function and 12% for the horizontal Green’s function.

This allows us to conclude that on average our model of the displacements caused by

atmospheric pressure loading is correct. At the same time for some stations the model

does not agree with data perfectly. These stations are located either close to a coast,

or in isolated islands, or in mountain regions.

In the ﬁrst case, poor modeling of the

ocean response to atmospheric pressure forcing becomes a signiﬁcant factor; in the latter

case the spatial resolution of the weather model, 2◦.5 × 2◦.5, is too coarse to represent

adequately the surface pressure ﬁeld variations.

PETROV AND BOY: ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE LOADING

We have detected for the ﬁrst time the horizontal component of the atmospheric pressure

loading signal. This signal has never been before taken into account in routine reduction

of geodetic observations. If not modeled, it adds noise to the horizontal site position with

an rms of 0.6 mm and to the estimates of the EOP with an rms of 100 prad. According

to the estimates of the error budget, the residual site displacements due to atmospheric

pressure loading which is not accounted for by our model, on average have an rms of 0.4

mm for the vertical component and 0.1 mm for the horizontal component.

The model presented here shows a signiﬁcant improvement with respect to the previous

models. The amount of power which is present in the model, but not found in the data

is 38% for the VDH model, 12% when the linear regression approach is used, and 5% for

our model.

We propose our model of the atmospheric pressure loading for use in routine processing

of space geodesy observations. We have computed time series of the atmospheric pres-

sure loading for all VLBI and SLR sites starting from May 1976. These time series are

available on the Web at http://gemini.gsfc.nasa.gov/aplo and are updated daily.

Since December 2002 the contribution of the atmospheric pressure loading displacements

is applied on a routine basis at the VLBI analysis center of the NASA Goddard Space

Flight Center.

We expect that the new numerical weather models with higher spatial and temporal

resolution will improve the agreement of pressure loading time series with observations in

mountainous regions. Development of ocean models forced by atmospheric pressure and

winds will improve the pressure loading estimates for coastal and island stations.

and index i runs over latitude and index j runs over longitude. Here we replaced the

integration over the sphere with a sum of integrals over small cells. q = 1 for the vertical

component.

Green’s functions have a singularity in 0, so care must be taken in using numerical

schemes for computing the convolution integral. Although the Green’s function cannot

be represented analytically over the whole range of its argument, we can always ﬁnd a

good approximation over a small range. We approximate the function G(ψ) · ψ by a

polynomial of the third degree α + β ψ + γ ψ2 + δ ψ3. In order to compute the integral

A2 over the cell, we introduce a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the

origin in the center of the cell and the axis x towards east, the axis y towards north. We

neglect the Earth’s curvature and consider the cell as a rectangle with borders [-a, a], [-b,

b] on the x and y axes respectively. Then the integral of the Green’s function over the

cell with respect to a site with coordinates (xs, ys) is evaluated analytically:

not exceed 1%. At large angular distances we can consider the Green’s function to be

constant over the cell. For an angular distance more than 0.16 rad, taking the Green’s

function out of the integral A2 and replacing it with the value at the angular distance

between the site and the center of the cell causes an error of less than 1%.

Two land-sea masks are used for practical computation: coarse with the resolution of

the surface pressure grid, and ﬁne. If the cell of the coarse land-sea mask is completely

land or completely sea, this cell is used for computing the integral A3. Otherwise, the

coarse resolution cell is subdivided in smaller cells of the ﬁne resolution grid, and the

integral over each ﬁne resolution cell is computed independently. The surface pressure

is considered as deﬁned at the corners of the coarse resolution cell. The pressure at the

center of the cell is obtained by bi-linear interpolation. When ul(~r ) is computed, the

cells which are over ocean are bypassed. Alternatively, the cells which are over land are

bypassed when uo(~r ) is computed.

Abstract

In this paper the interrelation between geomagnetic pulsations and vari-
ations in frequency Doppler shift fd of the ionosphere-reﬂected radio sig-
nal is under investigation. The experiment on simultaneous recording of
fd variations and geomagnetic pulsations was organised at high latitude
station in Norilsk (geomagnetic latitude and longitude 64.2◦N, 160.4◦E,
L = 5.3) during Febrary-April of 1995-98. Thirty cases of simultaneous
recording of duration from 10 min to two hour were analysed: 6 cases of
simultaneous recording of variations fd and regular geomagnetic pulsations
Pc5; and 25 cases of recording of fd variations and irregular pulsations Pi2.
On the basis of experimental results, the following conclusions have
been drawn: a) Hydromagnetic waves in the range of regular Pc5 pul-
sations, when interacting with the ionospheric F2 layer, make the main
contribution to short-period fd variations. The possible mechanism of fd
variations are oscillations of electron density, associated with distribution
of a hydromagnetic wave in an ionosphere. b) There exists an unquestion-
able interrelation between fd variations of the sporadic E layer-reﬂected
radio signal and irregular Pi2 pulsations, but for some reasons it is traced
poorly.

1 Introduction

The correlation between variations of ionospheric parameters and variations of the
Earth’s geomagnetic ﬁeld has attracted the attention of researchers over decades
[1, 2, 3]. Comparison of fragments of simultaneously recorded geomagnetic pulsa-
tions and short-period variations in frequency Doppler shift fd of the ionosphere-
reﬂected radio signal point to an unquestionable correlation between ionospheric

parameter variations and the excitation regime of geomagnetic pulsations. The
possibility of investigating Pi2 geomagnetic pulsations by recording fd variations
is discussed in [4, 5]. In [5], it is conﬁrmed that geomagnetic pulsations are hy-
dromagnetic waves generated in the magnetosphere. The authors of [5, 6] have
established that hydromagnetic waves in the ionosphere can be studied by using
the Doppler method. In [7], it is suggested that hydromagnetic waves give rise
to a displacement of the ionospheric layer, and hence to the appearance in the
ionosphere of small-scale wave disturbances with frequencies ranging from 1.5
mHz to 100-200 mHz. It is also argued that there is a close relationship between
short-period disturbances in the ionosphere and Pi2, Pip and PiC geomagnetic
pulsations [7]. The authors of [8] have revealed that wave disturbances in the
high-latitude ionosphere are accompanied by the generation of Pi2 pulsations.

In spite of many years of theoretical and experimental research, it has not
yet been possible to conclusively elucidate the mechanisms [6, 9, 10] accounting
for the relationship between short-period variations in frequency Doppler shift
of the ionosphere-reﬂected radio signal and geomagnetic pulsations. One of the
reasons for this, as suggested by the authors of [10], has to do with the diﬃculty
in obtaining statistically signiﬁcant sets of experimental data.

Thus the relationship between fd variations and geomagnetic pulsations is
of profound importance for the investigation of the inﬂuence of hydromagnetic
waves on the structure and dynamics of the high-latitude ionosphere, on the one
hand, and for the study of the geomagnetic pulsations themselves, on the other.
Unfortunately, currently there is no clear understanding both of the morphology
and of the physical origin of the relationships between ionospheric parameter
variations and geomagnetic pulsations. The objective of this experimental paper
is to establish the behavior patterns of the high-latitude ionosphere during periods
of observation of diﬀerent kinds of geomagnetic pulsations.

During 1995-1998, at the high-latitude station in Norilsk (geomagnetic lati-
tude and longitude 64.2◦N, 160.4◦E, L = 5.3), an experiment was organized on a
simultaneous recording of fd variations and geomagnetic pulsations.

2 Experimental equipment and technique

The measurements of ionospheric parameters were made with the hardware-
software facility for vertical-incidence ionospheric sounding that was developed
on the basis of ionosonde R-017 and a personal computer [11]. Some characteris-
tics of the facility are: 2 kW transmitter pulse power, 135±15 ms pulse duration,
and 50 Hz sounding pulse repetition rate.

The impulse signal in the vertical-incidence sounding mode was transmitted
using the broadband delta-type antenna, with the main lobe width of the beam of
600. Half-wave dipole antennas operating at the mean frequency of the working
range, 6 MHz, were used as receive antennas.

2

When operated at ﬁxed frequency, the facility provided a Doppler spectrum
of the ionosphere-reﬂected radio signal, as well as making it possible to calculate
the weighted mean frequency Doppler shift fd. The interval for spectral analysis
was taken to be 20 s, which ensured a frequency resolution of 0.05 Hz. A spectral
analysis was carried out in the frequency band ±6 Hz. Observations as long
as 15 min to several hours were carried out with the signal/noise ratio of at
least 10. The experiment used working frequencies in the range 2-4 mHz; the
signal reﬂected from the ionospheric Es and F2 layers was received. Geomagnetic
pulsations were recorded on a 24-hour basis with the induction magnetometer in
the frequency band 0.5-0.005 Hz, in the dynamic range 0.01-100 nT.

3 Experimental results

The observations were carried out in March, 1995, February, 1996, in March-
April 1998. The fd variations were recorded during passage of the high latitude
geomagnetic pulsations (GP): regular pulsations Pc5 and irregular pulsations Pi2.
In total was analysed about 30 cases of simultaneous recording of fd variations
and GP. From them six cases were of recording fd variations during passage of
pulsations Pc5 and 25 cases were of recording of fd variations during passage Pi2.
Let’s consider in more detail two cases of simultaneous recording of fd varia-
tions and regular pulsations Pc5 which were observed in April 1, 1998 at 12:38-
13:00 UT (18:38-19:00 LT) and in April 5, 1998 at 11:20-11:40 UT (17:20-17:40
LT). The geomagnetic conditions of April 1, 1998 were quiet, the coeﬃcient of
geomagnetic activity Kp was equal 1. The amplitude north-south component
Pc5 was 33 nT, period of oscillations – 350 s (Fig. 1 a). Amplitude by east-
west component Pc5 – 30 nT, principal periods of oscillations – 210 s and 480
s (Fig. 1 b). The sounding was conducted on frequency 4.5 MHz at a relation
signal/noise not less than 10. The signal reﬂected from a F2-layer of ionosphere
was accepted. The critical frequency f0F 2 was 6-7 MHz, eﬀective height h′ –
270-300 km. Amplitude fd was 0.49 Hz, the periods – 210 s and 480 s. Fig.
1 d, e, f submit the diagrams of the spectrum time analysis (STAN) at coordi-
nates time-period-spectral density (d) – north-south (N-S) component of GP; (e)
– east-west (E-W) component of GP; (f) – variations fd. The variations of fd re-
spond to occurrence of geomagnetic pulsations and they are in an antiphase with
oscillations of east-west component GP. Thus the variations fd react not only to
pulsation of major amplitude (30 nT at 12:38 UT), but also ones respond to on
feeble oscillations 7 nT at 12:10 UT. The diagrams STAN submitted in Fig. 1 d,
e, f clearly show this fact. The response of fd variations on feeble oscillations GP
is imposed on fd variation with period approximately 30 min. The fd variations
with such periods is explain by passage of acoustic-gravity waves (AGW), which
periods for heights of a F2-layer lies in the range between 10 and 40 min.

3

The regular pulsations Pc5 in April 5, 1998 also were observed under quiet
geomagnetic requirements (Kp=1) (Fig. 2). The amplitude of north-south Pc5
component was 16.5 nT, period of oscillations – 360 s (Fig. 2 a). Amplitude
of east-west Pc5 component – 9.5nT , period of oscillations – 360 s (Fig. 2 b).
Variations of fd are submitted on Fig. 2 c. The sounding operation was performed
at 5 MHz frequency at a relation signal/noise not less than 15-20. The radiosignal
reﬂected from a F2 layer of an ionosphere was accepted. The critical frequency
f0F 2 was 7-8 MHz, eﬀective height h′ – 270 km. The amplitude of fd variations
was 0.56 Hz, a period of oscillations – 360 s. As well as in case of April 5 the long-
period variations with a period of medium-scale TIDs (1.7 mHz) are superimposed
on fd variations. It clearly that fd variations correlate with oscillations of GP.
The variations fd are in a phase with oscillations of east-west GP component
and are displaced in phase by 2-3 minutes for the north-south components of GP
oscillations. The principal frequency of fd variations coincides with frequency of
both north-south and east-west components of GP oscillations.

During observation of regular Pc5 pulsations in 5 of six cases the good correla-
tion of time series both spectrums of pulsations and fd variations is observed; for
one or for both components of the ﬁeld of pulsations. In each individual case the
responses of an ionosphere on GP oscillations have some diﬀerent. Speciﬁcally
the fd variations can be react on both components of GP or on one of them.

Irregularity pulsations Pi2 are observed in the explosive phase of geomagnetic
substorm. Norilsk at this time was in auroral zone. The regular layer F2 was
screened by a sporadic layer . The severity of the recording problem implied that
a total absorption of radio waves is generally observed in the ionosphere, when
the strongest, longest-lasting geomagnetic pulsations are excited. Nevertheless
the most part of observational data (25 cases) were received for pulsations Pi2.
In six cases from these 25 the conformity between Pi2 and fd is marked. Fig. 3
present the case in February 15, 1996 at 19:25-19:44 UT. At generation Pi2 there
is a abrupt ampliﬁcation of fd variations. The maximum amplitude of north-
south Pi2 component reach 21 nT, principal periods of oscillations – 50 s and 160
s (Fig. 3 a). Amplitude of east-west Pi2 component was 15 nT, the principal
periods of oscillations – 65 s and 120 s (Fig. 3 b). Fig. 3 c presents fd variations.
The sounding was conducted on frequency 3 MHz at a relation signal/noise about
5. The radiosignal reﬂected from Esr-layer was accepted. The amplitude of fd
variations at the moment of oscillation Pi2 sharply has increased to 0.34 Hz. The
principal periods of fd variations were 45 s, 65 s, 120 s, 180 s. Results for other ﬁve
cases are simultaneous. At occurrence irregularity pulsations Pi2 the amplitude
of fd variations was incremented and in the spectrum of variations fd there are
spectral components with GP periods. The spectrum of fd variations is the
complex, it include more spectral components, than spectrum GP. It is explained
by that variation of parameters of the ionosphere cause not only geomagnetic
pulsations, but also series of other factors.

4

In the majority of cases was revealed not any of conformity between fd vari-
ations and irregularity pulsations neither in a time series, nor in spectrums. One
of such cases (March 27, 1998) is given in Fig. 4. In these cases on fd variations
inﬂuence mechanisms more strong, than mechanisms associated with GP.

4 Discussion

It is universally accepted that geomagnetic pulsations, observed on the ground,
represent the manifestations of magnetospheric hydrodynamic waves propagat-
ing downward through the ionosphere [11, 13].
It is common knowledge that
the ionosphere modiﬁes the characteristics of hydromagnetic waves [13]. On the
other hand, ionospheric parameters can also undergo changes under the eﬀect
of hydrodynamic waves. This is conﬁrmed by simultaneous recordings of varia-
tions in frequency Doppler shift fd of the ionosphere-reﬂected radio signal and
geomagnetic pulsations [1-3, 6, 9, 10, 14]. The time coincidence of fd variations
and geomagnetic pulsations suggests that hydromagnetic waves in the range of
pulsations have a pronounced eﬀect on the ionosphere.

It should be noted that the mechanisms accounting for the correlation between

geomagnetic pulsations and fd variations still remain unclear [9, 10].

As has been pointed out above, the time series of Pc5 pulsations and fd
variations have a high degree of correlation (Fig. 1, 2). The ratio of amplitudes
of fd variations and geomagnetic pulsations was 0.02 − 0.07 Hz/nT. This value is
consistent with results (from 0.01 Hz/nT to 0.4 Hz/nT) obtained in [2, 10]. It is
clearly seen from Fig. 2b and 2c that at the time of observation of Pc5 pulsations
the spectral component of the fd variations, corresponding to the frequency of
Pc5, increases abruptly. The agreement between the time series and spectra of the
simultaneously recorded geomagnetic pulsations and fd variations suggests that
hydromagnetic waves of the Pc5 range, when interacting with the ionospheric F2
layer, make the main contribution to short-period fd variations.

As in [2, 3, 6], in most cases we detected only a slight correlation between
fd variations and geomagnetic pulsations. The simultaneous recording of Pi2 ge-
omagnetic pulsations and fd variations shows: a) at all events an almost total
absence of correlation between the time series; and b) in series of cases coinci-
dence of the principal maxima on the plots of spectral density of these phenomena
at the time of Pi2 observation. A similar situation was observed in the case of a
simultaneous recording of the luminosity of polar auroras and Pi2 pulsations [15].
The absence of correlation between time series of irregular Pi2 pulsations and fd
variations of the Es layer-reﬂected radio signal may be attributed to a variety

of Pi2 spaced by several degrees in latitude [15]. Secondly, at the sporadic E
layer heights the density of the neutral component is signiﬁcantly higher, and
its inﬂuence on ionospheric plasma drifts is stronger when compared with the

F2 layer. And thirdly, magnetic variations may be the response of ionospheric
currents within the ﬁeld of view of magnetometers (within the range of several
hundred kilometres), whereas the ionosonde measures less distant disturbances in
the ionosphere over the observation site, within the range of 50-100 km [4]. Fur-
thermore, there may be interference of the reﬂected radio waves from ionospheric
irregularities, as pointed out in [3, 4].

Nevertheless, it’s suggest that there is unquestionable correlation between fd
variations of the sporadic E layer-reﬂected radio signal and irregular Pi2 pulsa-
tions.

5 Conclusions

An experiment has been conducted on a simultaneous recording of the varia-
tions in frequency Doppler shift fd of the ionosphere-reﬂected radio signal and
geomagnetic pulsations measured on the ground.

Experimental results have revealed the following basic features:
a) the presence of a good correlation between regular Pc5 geomagnetic pul-
sations and variations in frequency Doppler shift fd of the ionospheric F2 layer-
reﬂected radio signal;

b) the abrupt enhancement of the spectral component of variations fd at the

frequency coinciding with that pulsations, at the time of Pc5 observation;

c) absence of a correlation between irregular Pi2 geomagnetic pulsations and
variations in frequency Doppler shift of the radio signal reﬂected from the sporadic
E layer of the auroral ionosphere;

d) in the series of cases at the time of Pi2 observation - an enhancement of the
short-period components of the spectrum of fd variations, and the coincidence of
the principal maxima on the plots of spectral density of fd variations and Pi2.

On the basis of these main results, the following conclusions have been drawn:
Hydromagnetic waves in the range of regular Pc5 pulsations, when interacting
with the ionospheric F2 layer, make the main contribution to short-period fd
variations. The possible mechanism of fd variations are oscillations of electron
density, associated with distribution of a hydromagnetic wave in an ionosphere.
There exists an unquestionable interrelation between fd variations of the spo-
radic E layer-reﬂected radio signal and irregular Pi2 pulsations, but for some
reasons it is noted poorly.

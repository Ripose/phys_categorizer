The power spectrum S of linear transects of the earth’s topography is

often observed to be a power-law function of wave number k with exponent

close to −2: S(k) ∝ k−2. In addition, river networks are fractal trees that sat-

isfy several power-law relationships between their morphologic components.

A model equation for the evolution of the earth’s topography by erosional

processes which produces fractal topography and fractal river networks is

presented and its solutions compared in detail to real topography. The model

is the diﬀusion equation for sediment transport on hillslopes and channels

with the diﬀusivity constant on hillslopes and proportional to the square root

of discharge in channels. The dependence of diﬀusivity on discharge follows

from fundamental equations of sediment transport. We study the model in

two ways. In the ﬁrst analysis the diﬀusivity is parameterized as a function

of relief and a Taylor expansion procedure is carried out to obtain a diﬀeren-

tial equation for the landform elevation which includes the spatially-variable

diﬀusivity to ﬁrst order in the elevation. The solution to this equation is

a self-aﬃne or fractal surface with linear transects that have power spec-

tra S(k) ∝ k−1.8, independent of the age of the topography, consistent with

observations of real topography. The hypsometry produced by the model

equation is skewed such that lowlands make up a larger fraction of the total

area than highlands as observed in real topography. In the second analysis

we include river networks explicitly in a numerical simulation by calculat-

ing the discharge at every point. We characterize the morphology of real

river basins with ﬁve independent scaling relations between six morphometric

variables. Scaling exponents are calculated for seven river networks from a

variety of tectonic environments using high-quality digital elevation models.

River networks formed in our model match the observed scaling laws and

satisfy Tokunaga side-branching statistics.

I. INTRODUCTION

A remarkable feature of the earth’s surface is its scale-invariance. Objects such as a

hammer or a person often need to be included in landscape photographs because features

such as variations in height of a topographic proﬁle have no characteristic scale. Similarly,

a scale on a map is often necessary to determine whether the map details features at the

scale of one kilometer or hundreds of kilometers. The scale-invariance of topography can be

quantiﬁed with techniques of time series analysis. Variations in the height of a topographic

proﬁle can be characterized with the probability density function and the power spectrum.

The probability density function quantiﬁes how the data is distributed about the mean. Two

examples of probability density functions are the normal and lognormal distributions. The

power spectrum S measures the persistence of the data. The power spectrum is deﬁned as

the square of the coeﬃcients in a Fourier series representation of the transect. It measures

the average variation of the function at diﬀerent wavelengths. If adjacent data points are

totally uncorrelated then the power spectrum will be constant as a function of wave number

(the reciprocal of the wavelength), i.e. white noise. If adjacent values are strongly correlated

relative to points far apart the power spectrum will be large at small wave numbers (long

wavelengths) and small at large wave numbers (short wavelengths). The power spectrum S of

linear transects of topography have a power-law dependence on wave number with exponent

close to −2 over a wide range of scales: S(k) ∝ k−2 [Vening Meinesz, 1951; Mandelbrot,

1975; Sayles and Thomas, 1978; Newman and Turcotte, 1990]. Culling and Datko [1987] have

obtained equivalent results with the rescaled-range technique. Matsushita and Ouchi [1989]

have computed the roughness exponent H deﬁned by the relationship between the standard

deviation and the length L of the transect, σ ∝ LH , for several topographic transects.

They obtained H ≈ 0.55 which implies a power spectral exponent of β = −2.1 from the

relation β = 2H + 1 [Turcotte, 1992]. Ahnert [1984] obtained a similar value. Turcotte

[1987] and Balmino [1993] have computed the power spectrum from a spherical harmonic

representation of the earth’s topography and bathymetry. They observed a power spectrum

2

S(k) ∝ k−2 at scales less than 10,000 km and an approximately constant spectrum at larger

scales. Similar scale-invariance has been identiﬁed in the earth’s bathymetry [Bell, 1975], the

topography of natural rock surfaces [Brown and Scholz, 1985], and the topography of Venus

[Kucinskas et al., 1992]. The observation of scale-invariant topography on Venus indicates

that fractal topography can be formed without erosion. A power-law power spectrum is

indicative of scale-invariance since the power-law function has no length scale in it. Turcotte

[1992] has shown that these observations deﬁne topography to be a self-aﬃne fractal with a

fractal dimension close to 2.5. Synthetic topography which assumes random phases in the

Fourier coeﬃcients can be generated which have S(k) ∝ k−2 as observed in real topography.

Images of synthetic topography with S(k) ∝ k−2 produced with techniques described in Voss

[1988] and presented in Mandelbrot [1983] resemble natural topography. However, the lack

of any river networks in these images indicates that the power spectrum is not a complete

representation of the earth’s topography [Weissel, Pratson, and Malinverno, 1994]. Gilbert

[1989] and Evans and McClean [1995] have documented deviations from scale-invariance of

the earth’s topography.

Besides the power spectrum, the distribution or hypsometry of topography is an impor-

tant statistical measure. The topography of the earth’s continents are highly skewed such

that a much larger percentage of the earth’s topography is lowlands (topography with an

elevation below the median elevation for a region) and there is a positive correlation between

elevation and slope (i.e. as one drives up a mountain, the steepness of the climb increases).

This is not predicted by a model with a Gaussian distribution such as the Brownian walk

[Weissel, Pratson, and Malinverno, 1994] . This discrepancy between Gaussian models

of topography and observed topography is consistent with the observation of Mandelbrot

[1983] who found that when he transformed his Gaussian synthetic topography with a cubic

function, the topography looked more realistic.

Many studies have attempted to model the evolution of drainage networks. Recent papers

have emphasized their fractal properties. Some authors describe discretized models which

follow the ﬂow of discrete units of runoﬀ down the steepest slope and erode the hillslope

3

with an assumed dependence of denudation on slope (and possibly other factors) [Willgoose,

Bras, and Rodriguez-Iturbe, 1991; Chase, 1992; Kramer and Marder, 1992; Leheny and Nagel,

1993; Inaoka and Takayasu, 1993; Howard, 1994]. After the drainage of a large number of

randomly deposited units of precipitation, a rough landscape is produced. Willgoose et

al. [1991], Leheny and Nagel [1993], Kramer and Marder [1992], and Inaoka and Takayasu

[1993] have shown that their models produce drainage networks consistent with the observed

scaling behavior of real drainage networks. Chase [1992] has presented a model that can

produce fractal topography with fractal dimensions broadly consistent with observed values.

Models have also been proposed which do not explicitly model the landform topography but

only the growth of the drainage network. Stark [1991] has proposed a model based on self-

avoiding percolation clusters. Kondoh and Matsushita [1986], Meakin, Feder, and Jossang

[1991], Masek and Turcotte [1993], and Stark [1994] have presented models based on diﬀusion-

limited-aggregation (DLA) and variants of DLA. In Masek and Turcotte [1993] the random

walkers are introduced randomly into the landscape rather than at the boundaries (as in

traditional DLA) to better model the eﬀect of storms producing runoﬀ randomly in space and

time. Other approaches include that of Newman and Turcotte [1990] who propose a cascade

model similar to Kolmogorov’s model of the turbulent cascade in which the variance at

each scale is dependent only on that scale and the next largest one. Several studies have

proposed continuum growth equations. Sornette and Zhang [1993] have advocated a model

equation known as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, originally introduced in the

physics literature to model the growth of atomic surfaces by ion deposition [Kardar, Parisi,

and Zhang, 1986], as a model for the evolution of topography by geomorphic processes.

Newman and Turcotte [1990] and Sornette and Zhang [1993] have stressed the necessity of

nonlinear terms in order to produce scale-invariant topography. The KPZ equation is

∂h
∂t

= D∇2h +

(∇h)2 + η(x, y, t)

λ
2

(1)

where η(x, y, t) is a Gaussian white noise. The ﬁrst term represents the classic Culling

diﬀusion model of slope erosion. Culling [1960, 1963] hypothesized that the horizontal

4

ﬂux of eroded material was proportional to the slope. With conservation of mass this

yields the diﬀusion equation. Solutions to the diﬀusion equation have been successfully

applied to modeling the evolution of alluvial fans, incised channels, prograding deltas, and

eroding fault scarps [Wallace, 1977; Nash, 1980; Begin et al., 1981; Gill, 1983a,b; Hanks et

al., 1984; Hanks and Wallace, 1985; Kenyon and Turcotte, 1985; Phillips and Sutherland,

1986]. McKean et al.

[1993] have implied diﬀusion coeﬃcients of hillslope evolution with

geochemical methods. They obtained similar diﬀusion constants to those inferred from

modeling fault scarp relaxation. The last term in equation 1 represents spatial variations

in erosion intensity produced by the intermittent nature of runoﬀ production and mass

movements, spatial variations in the erodibility of the soil and rock of the landscape, and

episodic tectonic uplift. The inclusion of a stochastic term such as this is a universal feature

of models considered in the physics literature which produce self-aﬃne surfaces. Sornette

and Zhang [1993] have argued that the nonlinear term in equation 1 is essential for the

formation of a scale-invariant surface. The nonlinear term is equivalent to assuming that

the erosion rate is proportional to the local exposed landscape surface. Somfai and Sander

[Scaling and river networks: A Landau theory, unpublished manuscript, 1996] have also

employed the KPZ equation and have produced landscapes which obey Horton’s laws with

simulations incorporating only the nonlinear term in the the equation for the local erosion

rate of the surface. Smith and Bretherton [1972] have presented a generalized model of

hillslope evolution which includes the KPZ nonlinear term as a special case. Giacometti,

Maritan, and Banavar [1995] have proposed a continuum growth equation that includes

higher order terms not present in the KPZ equation.

It should be emphasized that a great variety of models, including most of those listed,

obey Horton’s laws. Horton’s laws state that stream number, average stream length, and

average drainage area decrease geometrically with stream order deﬁned by the Strahler or-

dering scheme. Since so many diﬀerent models obey Horton’s laws, agreement with Horton’s

laws does not appear to be suﬃcient to verify that a model is an accurate representation

of drainage network formation [Willgoose, 1994]. In fact, Kirchner [1993] has argued that

5

Horton’s laws are satisﬁed by virtually all possible branching networks. Tokunaga [1984]

and Peckham’s [1995] improved classiﬁcation of stream order appears to be a more stringent

test for models and is a signiﬁcant advance in this regard.

In this paper we investigate a model of landform evolution with topographic evolution

by geomorphic processes parameterized with the diﬀusion equation. The model we propose

reproduces the observed statistical behavior of both topography and river networks. The

diﬀusion equation models the relaxation of topographic variations by overland and channel

ﬂow. In Section 2 we present a derivation due to Begin, Meyer, and Schumm [1981] which

shows diﬀusivity to be proportional to the square root of the discharge. It is this dependence

on discharge, itself dependent on the basin morphology, that gives rise to a complex unstable

behavior from such a simple model. Our ﬁrst analysis of the model will be to parameterize

the diﬀusivity as a function of relief and perform a Taylor expansion retaining the spatial

variability of diﬀusivity to ﬁrst order in the elevation. A nonlinear partial diﬀerential equa-

tion is derived and solved which reproduces the hypsometry and power-spectral behavior

of real topography. In Section 4 numerical simulations are performed which explicitly in-

clude river networks and calculate the discharge at every point. Realistic river networks and

topography are generated.

II. DEPENDENCE OF DIFFUSIVITY ON DISCHARGE

Begin, Meyer, and Schumm [1981] have derived the diﬀusion equation for channel evolu-

tion using similar assumptions to those used by Culling [1960, 1963] for hillslope evolution.

Their derivation began with classic equations of sediment transport. They showed diﬀusiv-

ity to be proportional to the discharge per unit width above a point on the surface. The

authors began with a commonly observed empirical relationship between sediment ﬂux Qs

and bottom shear stress τ :

where f is the Darcy-Weisbach factor, g is the acceleration due to gravity, R is the hydraulic

radius, and ∂h

∂x is the channel slope along the length of the longitudinal proﬁle of a channel.

For wide channels, v = Qw/R where Qw is the water discharge per unit width. Substituting

this relation into equation 3, Begin, Meyer, and Schumm [1981] obtained

Substituting the expression for R into the equation τ = ρgR ∂h

∂x , where ρ is the density of

water, gives

Substituting this into equation 2 results in the following expression for sediment discharge

Since ∂h

∂t = ∂Qs

∂x by conservation of mass, equation 6 gives a diﬀusion equation for the channel

elevation with a diﬀusivity propotional to the water discharge per unit width:

where c is a constant dependent on f , g, and ρ. The diﬀusion model and a discharge-

dependent diﬀusivity is consistent with the laboratory measurements of aggradation and

degradation in channels by Gill [1983a,b] and Phillips and Sutherland [1986].

Since the width of a river is proportional to the square root of the discharge [Leopold,

Wolman, and Miller, 1964], the diﬀusivity of a channel is proportional to Q/w ∝ Q/Q

2 ∝

In order to solve this equation it is necessary to parameterize discharge in terms of the

morphology of the basin. Discharge is principally a function of drainage basin area.

It

is often assumed that discharge and area are proportional [Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1992].

However, in an analysis of 350 of the world’s largest river basins, Mulder and Syvitski [1996]

have established the relationship between average discharge and drainage area to be a power-

law relationship with exponent 0.75: Qav ∝ A0.75. This means that larger basins drain less

water per unit area than small basins. One interpretation of this observation is that more

inﬁltration occurs in large basins. To test this hypothesis, Mulder and Syvitski [1996] related

the average discharge Qav to the basin area corrected by the cosine of the average basin

slope, A/ cos α. They obtained a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.9 with this expression compared

to 0.74 for the power-law relationship, lending support to the hypothesis. However, in

order to maintain consistency with the power-law relationships we will identify between

the morphometric variables, we will relate discharge to drainage area using the power-law

relationship Qav ∝ A

4 . The model equation as a function of area is then

III. APPROXIMATE SOLUTION OF THE MODEL EQUATION

Discharge is a function of basin relief, the diﬀerence in elevation between the highest and

lowest points in the basin. In ﬁrst-order streams high in mountainous areas the discharge

is very small compared to that for lowland rivers.

In this section we parameterize the

discharge as a function of relief to obtain a single diﬀerential equation for the local elevation

in space and time, h(x, y, t). The equation is solved and its solutions are found to have

a hypsometry and power spectrum comparable to those of real topography dominated by

erosional processes.

8

In Section 4 we will present the results of morphometric analyses of river networks. We

will show the drainage area to be a power function with exponents between 3 and 5 of

the basin relief, h − hmax, where h is the elevation of the outlet and hmax is the maximum

elevation of the basin. Since the diﬀusivity is deﬁned to be a power-law function of drainage

area, the dependence of the diﬀusivity on relief is also a power law with exponent a:

D ∝ (h − hmax)a

(10)

D can be expanded in a Taylor series for small h: D ≈ D0 − D1h where D0 and D1 are

positive constants.

The diﬀusion equation with spatially variable diﬀusivity is

The diﬀusivity must be kept inside the gradient term since it is not a constant. The chain

rule has been used.

Substituting equation 10 into equation 11 and keeping only terms ﬁrst order in h gives

∂h
∂t

= ∇(D(h/hmax)∇h)

= D(h/hmax)∇2h +

(∇h)2

∂D
∂h

∂h
∂t

= D0∇2h − D1(∇h)2

(11)

(12)

The eﬀects of the terms in equation 12 are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1a,

the topography at time t is assumed to be given by a Gaussian function. The topography

is taken to be one-dimensional for the purposes of illustration. The rate of change of the

surface resulting from the diﬀusion term is given in Figure 1b and the surface at time t + ∆t

is shown in Figure 1c. The eﬀect of the diﬀusion term is to aggrade the topography where

the surface is concave up and erode where the surface is concave down. The topography of

the surface at time t + ∆t is also a Gaussian function.

In contrast, the nonlinear term does not preserve the Gaussianity of the initial surface.

Figure 2 presents the same sequence of graphs for the nonlinear term. The term erodes

9

material where the slope is large resulting in a more concave topography with a skewed hyp-

sometry and a larger fraction of topography in lowlands compared to the original Gaussian

function.

Equation 12 is completely deterministic. However, there is abundant empirical evidence

that spatially and temporally variable erosion rates are universal over a wide range of time

and length scales. Much of the sediment carried away in rivers is carried away in intermittent

storms whose occurrence can only be described statistically. An example of this intermit-

tency is the time series of sediment load in the Santa Clara River. The sediment load of

the Santa Clara was carefully monitored for a period of 18 years. Over half of the total

sediment yield carried by the river was transported in only three large ﬂoods totaling seven

days [Milliman and Syvitski, 1992]. Similar large bursts of sediment transport are evident in

the sediment transport time series of Plotnick and Prestegaard [1993] on time scales of hours.

Many examples of large ﬂoods which have resulted in major landscape modiﬁcation have

been documented in the geologic record [Bretz, 1969; Meyer and Nash, 1983; Ager 1993].

Spatially and temporally variable erosion rates have been documented over a variety of spa-

tial and temporal scales and geomorphological settings [Luk, 1982; Ormi, 1982; Schmidt,

1985]. A steady-state competition between intermittent stochastic forcing and subsequent

relaxation of the landscape has been argued to be the essential dynamic of landscape evolu-

tion [Wolman and Gerson, 1978]. A model of landscape evolution as a sequence of epsodic

events is consistent with the age distributions of rock avalanches and sedimentary sequences

[Griﬃths, 1993]. These observations suggest that any model of landform evolution must

include stochastic spatial and temporal variability in erosion rates. If we include spatial and

temporal variations in erosion rates by adding a Gaussian white noise erosion rate, η(x, y, t),

to equation 12, the result is the KPZ equation (equation 1).

The solution to the KPZ equation is a self-aﬃne or fractal surface with linear transects

that have power-law power spectra with an exponent of −1.8: S(k) ∝ k−1.8 [Amar and

Family, 1989]. This is concluded by relating the Hausdorﬀ measure reported for the KPZ

model, H ≈ 0.4, to the one-dimensional power spectral exponent, β, through the relation

10

β = 2H + 1 [Turcotte, 1992]. Due to the diﬃculty of solving nonlinear partial diﬀerential

equations numerically [Newman and Bray, Strong-coupling behavior in discrete Kardar-

Parisi-Zhang equations, unpublished manuscript, 1996], a cellular automaton model, the

restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) model, has been developed by Kim and Kosterlitz [1989]

with rules that mimic the terms in the KPZ equation. Park and Kahng [1995] have shown

that the RSOS model is equivalent to the KPZ equation in the continuum limit.

In the

RSOS model, a site on a two-dimensional lattice of points is chosen at random. The height

of the surface at that point is incremented by one if the elevation at that point is greater

than or equal to the elevations of all of its four nearest neighbors. If this restriction is not

satisﬁed, nothing happens. This rule is repeated until a surface with a height equal to or

greater than the linear dimension of the lattice is generated. Periodic boundary conditions

are used. We performed simulations of this model on a 256 x 256 lattice. A shaded relief

image of an example of a surface generated with this model is shown in Figure 3. The average

power spectrum, estimated as the square of the coeﬃcients of the Fast Fourier Transform,

of linear transects of this surface is presented in Figure 4. The power spectrum of each row

of the lattice was computed and then averaged with the power spectra of all other rows

in order to obtain the average power spectrum. A good match with the power spectrum

S(k) ∝ k−1.8, indicated by the straight line, is obtained. This power spectrum agrees with

the ﬁnite diﬀerence calculation of the KPZ equation of Amar and Family [1989]. This power

spectrum is close to the spectrum S(k) ∝ k−2 observed in erosional topography by Huang

and Turcotte [1989] and others. The power spectral behavior observed in real topography

is independent of the age of the topography (time since signiﬁcant uplift occurred) and the

initial relief following tectonic uplift. For instance, young, rough mountain ranges, such as

the Rocky Mountains, exhibit the same power spectral exponent or fractal dimension as

smooth mountain ranges such as the Appalachians. Similarly, in the RSOS model a steady-

state condition is acheived once a rough surface is produced. In the steady-state condition,

the smoothing eﬀects of the diﬀusion term are balanced by the roughening eﬀects and the

power spectral behavior is independent of time. A rougher landscape, deﬁned as a larger

11

variance per unit wavelength, can be produced by increasing the ratio of the variance of the

stochastic term to the diﬀusion constant. Rougher topography has a larger power spectral

density. However, the power spectral exponent, which quantiﬁes the relative amplitude of

topography at diﬀerent wavelengths, is the same for rough or smooth topography.

The topography of the earth’s surface is skewed such that a much larger percentage of

the earth’s topography is lowlands and there is a positive correlation between elevation and

slope. This skew can be associated with the nonlinear term in equation 11.

If only the

diﬀusion term were present, the resulting topography would have a Gaussian distribution.

This is because any linear transformation of a function with a Gaussian distribution, such

as the noise term in equation 1, results in a function with a Gaussian distribution. The

probability density function (p.d.f.) of elevations (hypsometry) produced by the RSOS

model is presented in Figure 5a. The p.d.f. was computed using the surfaces generated from

10 simulation runs. The observed p.d.f.

is not Gaussian, but is skewed slightly such that

the most probable elevation is below the mean elevation of the landscape, i.e. more of the

total landscape area is represented by lowlands than highlands. The skew of the distribution

increases as the ratio D1/D0 increases. The probability distributions for the Kentucky and

Mississippi River basins are given in Figures 5b and 5c, respectively. The ETOPO5 dataset

[Loughridge, 1986] was used to compute the hypsometry of the Mississippi River basin and

the USGS 1deg DEMs [United States Geological Survey, 1990] were used to compute the

hypsometry of the Kentucky River basin. Both hypsometries exhibit skew towards lower

elevations. This skew is directly comparable to the skew in the RSOS topography and can

be associated with the nonlinear term.

Figure 6a-c shows the cumulative percentage of area larger than a given area computed

by Harrison et al. [1983] using the ETOPO5 dataset [Loughridge, 1986] for the continents of

Africa, North America, and South America, with a least-square ﬁt to a lognormal distribu-

tion. The hypsometric curves presented in the independent study of Cogley [1985] are similar

to those presented in Harrison et al. [1983]. The calculated hypsometric curves appear to

approach a skewed lognormal distribution as the age since signiﬁcant uplift increases. Of

12

the three continents, Africa has experienced the least neotectonic uplift. South America has

experienced the most. The hyposmetry of Africa matches a lognormal distribution more

closely than South America where the presence of the relatively young Andes mountains re-

sults in a signiﬁcant deviation from a lognormal distribution. This suggests that continental

hypsometric curves approach a lognormal distribution as erosion has more time to act on

the landscape.

IV. RIVER NETWORKS

The objective of this section is to incorporate river networks into equation 9. There are

several power-law relationships between the morphologic components of river basins. Some

of these components are based on the Strahler ordering scheme. In this scheme, a stream

with a channel head is deﬁned as a ﬁrst-order stream. When two like-order streams combine

they form a downstream segment one order higher than the order of the tributary streams.

A partial list of the observed morphological relations in natural river networks is:

1) Horton [1945] deﬁned three ratios, RB, RL, and RA to be the ratio between the

number, average length, and average drainage area from the streams of one order to those

of the next lowest order. He found this ratio to be a constant for all stream orders. The

fractal dimension of river networks is deﬁned as D = log RB/ log RL. D is usually found to

be approximately 1.9 [Turcotte, 1992].

2) An improved classiﬁcation scheme leading to a relation similar to Horton’s laws has

been developed by Tokunaga [1984] and Peckham [1995]. They deﬁned matrix elements To,k

as the number of side tributaries of order k of streams of order o. Natural river networks

satisfy the constraint that To,o−k is constant for all o. Shreve’s classic random topology model

[Shreve, 1966] fails to satisfy this constraint [Peckham, 1995]. The classic DLA growth model

satisﬁes this property [Ossadnik, 1992].

3) Hack [1957] found that the length of a main channel length scales with the drainage

area according to power law: L ∝ Aq. He reported values of q ≈ 0.6 for two river basins.

13

Gray [1961] obtained a value of 0.57. Some other morphometric analyses based on hundreds

of river basins, however, have found no signiﬁcant deviation from 0.5 [Montgomery and

Dietrich, 1992; Mulder and Syvitski, 1996].

4) Along-channel slope is a power law function of discharge with exponent close to −1/2:

S ∝ Q

[Carlston, 1968]. If it is assumed that discharge and area are proportional, this

− 1
2
av

implies that channel slope is inversely proportional to the square root of the drainage area:
S ∝ A− 1

2 . This assumption is often made and the relationship S ∝ A− 1

2 is considered to be a

universal feature of river networks [Tarboton et al., 1989]. However, as we have pointed out,

average discharge and drainage area are not proportional. Thus, one of the two relationships

S ∝ Q

− 1
av or S ∝ A− 1
2

2 should be considered suspect.

The fractal properties of river networks have reviewed by many authors including LaBar-

bera and Rosso [1989], Beer and Borgas [1993], Nikora [1994], and Maritan et al.

[1996].

Abrahams [1984] has reviewed other emprical relations observed for river basin morphology

such as the statistics of junction angles.

In order to better characterize the morphometric relations between drainage basin com-

ponents we have carried out river network extraction and analyses on seven basins from

a variety of tectonic environments using high-quality Digital Elevation Models. Four river

networks were chosen from the composite DEM of Fielding et al. [1994]. This data set has

80 m resolution and does not rely on the interpolation of contour lines. Such interpolation,

as is done in the USGS 1deg DEMs, may lead to biased slope estimates. Three of these

basins are located along the Himalayan front in Nepal, Kumaun, and Bhutan. The fourth

is located in the Shanxi Province, China and is formed in loess. This basin has an unusally

ordered shape characterized by a high degree of symmetry and unusually straight valleys.

The remaining three networks are located in North America. The Kentucky River basin

and Schoharie Creek basin were extracted from USGS 1deg DEMs [United States Geological

Survey, 1990]. The Mississippi River basin was chosen so that a large basin was represented.

The Mississippi was extracted from the ETOPO5 data set [Loughridge, 1986]. The seven

basins are plotted in Figure 7. Although the river network extraction and analyses were

14

carried out down to the pixel size of the DEM, only rivers with Strahler orders larger than

three were plotted so that the network can be identiﬁed. The river network extraction and

analyses were carried out with RiverTools 1.01 [Peckham, 1997].

The analyses we carried out enable us to identify ﬁve independent morphologic rela-

tionships between six components. The results are shown in Figures 8 through 12 and are

summarized in Table 1. The six morphometric components are stream number of a particu-

lar Strahler order N, Strahler order o, main channel length L, drainage area A, basin relief

R, and along-channel slope S. The relationships between the variables are deﬁned as

N ∝ Ap

L ∝ Aq

S ∝ Ar

R ∝ As

A ∝ to

Figure 8 presents the total number of streams of a given Strahler order as a function of

the average basin area for that Strahler order for each of the seven basins. The order of plots

in Figures 8-13 is, from top to bottom, the Kumaun basin, the Loess plateau of the Shanxi

Province, Schoharie Creek, the Nepal basin, the Kentucky River basin, the Mississippi River

basin, and the Bhutan river basin. The plots are oﬀset so that they may be placed on the

same graph. Figure 8 indicates that N is approximately proportional to A−1 indicating that

p ≈ −1.

Figure 9 presents the relationship between L and A. The plots indicate that q ≈ 0.5.

There has been considerable debate about whether q approaches 0.5 exactly or whether

there is a signiﬁcant deviation. The reason for the debate is that if q 6= 1/2 then this may

represent a deviation from self-similarity [Ijjasz-Vasquez et al., 1993]. Our analyses exhibit a

variation in q from basin to basin that is roughly equal to the previously reported devations

from 1/2. Therefore, we cannot deﬁnitively conclude whether q diﬀers from 1/2 in river

basins as a general rule.

15

Figure 10 indicates that r ≈ 3/8. This is inconsistent with previous studies that have

reported S ∝ A− 1

2 [Tarboton et al., 1989]. The value r ≈ 3/8 is entirely consistent with

the observed relationships of channel slope to discharge and the scaling of discharge and

drainage area: S ∝ Q

av and Qav ∝ A

4 implies S ∝ A

8 , as observed. The work of Tarboton

3

et al.

[1989] carried out analyses on two river basins with three orders-of-magnitude of

area in the analyses. Given that our analyses were carried out on several basins with ﬁve

orders-of-magnitude of area with a high-quality DEM we propose that r ≈ 3/8 is a more

reliable estimate. This conclusion appears to be consistent with the data of Montgomery and

Dietrich [1988] who presented similar slope-area relationships. Although no exponents were

obtained, the trends of their data follow a power-law relationship with exponent signiﬁcantly

greater than −1/2 (i.e. closer to −3/8).

The observed scaling between along-channel slope and drainage area follows directly from

equation 9. The ﬂux of sediment is given by Qs = DcA

∂x . For a longitudinal proﬁle in

equilibrium, ∂Qs

is observed between s ≈ 1/5 and s ≈ 1/3.

Plotted in Figure 11 are the relationships between relief R and area A. A range of values

The relationship between basin area and Strahler order o is plotted in Figure 12. In this

ﬁgure area is plotted on a logarithmic (base 10) scale while Strahler order is plotted on a

linear scale. The slopes are observed to be approximately 2/3. Thus, the Horton ratio RA

is equal to 10

3 ≈ 4.6. Using the other morphometric relations, we can estimate RL and RB

2

as 2.2 and 4.6, respectively.

The results of Tokunaga side-branching statistical analyses on the seven drainage basins

is presented in Figure 13. In this ordering scheme matrix elements To,k are deﬁned to be the

number of side tributaries of Strahler order k of streams of Strahler order o. Natural river

networks satisfy the constraint that To,o−k is constant for all o. We have determined Tk by

averaging the vales of To,o−k over o:

Plotted in Figure 13 is Tk on a logarithmic (base 10) scale as a function of k on a linear

scale. The plots indicate that Tk ∝ uk where u is estimated to be 100.4 ≈ 2.5.

We now consider the numerical simulation of equation 9. The resulting model river

networks will be analyzed in the same manner as the real river networks analyzed above.

The equation was simulated on a square lattice of 64 x 64 grid points. The equation was

discretized in space and time. Integration in time utilized the predictor-corrector method

which varies the time step to ensure stability. The initial condition was an elevation of 1.0

on every point of lattice except for the upper left corner which was moved down to 0.0 at

t=0 and ﬁxed to be zero for the entire calculation. The slope at all of the edges was ﬁxed to

be 0.1 except for the upper left corner which was unconstrained. This constraint on slope at

the boundaries is necessary because either the elevation or its derivative must be speciﬁed

at the boundaries. Since the largest slopes in a basin are in mountainous streams far from

the basin outlet, imposing a signiﬁcant slope on the boundary gridpoints while allowing the

elevations to be unconstrained as the drainage divide advances or retreats appeared to be

the most realistic boundary condition. The contributing area at each point was continuously

updated. Each grid point drained to the lowest of its nearest neighbors. If a grid point was

moved up or down such that it no longer was the lowest neighboring grid point for one of

its neighbors, the contributing area of each grid point downhill of the old drainage path

was decremented by one and the contributing area of each grid point downhill of the new

drainage path was incremented by one.

Since we are modeling the hillslope and the river network as distinct states, we must

model the growth of the channels into the hillslope. It may be of interest to model ﬂuc-

tuations in the topography with a river network already formed, but a complete model of

landscape evolution must consider the feedback between a growing network and the topog-

raphy of the adjacent hillslopes. One simple way to model growth of the network is to

start a simulation with one or more small channels draining to the border of the lattice and

17

extend the channel from these locations at a given rate when the area drained by the grid

point, a proxy for discharge, exceeds a given threshold. Such a model of headward growth

is supported by ﬁeld studies [Patton and Schumm, 1975; Begin and Schumm, 1979]. It was

also used in the model of Willgoose, Bras, and Rodriguez-Iturbe [1991]. In our model the

threshold for channelization was set to be zero so that every point in the lattice eventually

became a channel. The rate of channel advancement is governed by conservation of mass.

For the channel to advance a distance ∆x, the mass that must be moved downstream is

equal to ∂h

∂x ∆x where ∂h

∂x is the slope along the longitudinal proﬁle. Since the ﬂux is equal

to D(A) ∂h

∂x , the rate of channel advancement is proportional to D(A).

Greyscale plots of the elevations of the model surface for four instants of time are plotted

in Figure 14a-d. The surface elevations are mapped to a brightness scale with a gamme

function with a coeﬃcient of 2.0. The four instants of time correspond to those where

(a) 1/8 , (b) 1/4, (c) 1/2, and (d) all of the lattice has become channelized. Despite

the fact that the simulation is fully deterministic and begins with symmetric boundary

conditions, an asymmetric basin morphology is produced as a result of the instability of

channel downcutting. As a river basin cuts down its valley, the river basin increases its

drainage area. This further enhances channel downcutting and so one. Thus, any diﬀerence

in basin drainage area tends to be ampliﬁed over time by this instability.

In Figure 15a, the river network corresponding to the surface of Figure 14d is presented.

In this plot the river width is made equal to the Strahler order so that thicker rivers indicate

those that drain more area.

In Figure 15b is plotted the river network created with the

same parameters as Figure 15a but with some stochastic variability included in the sediment

transport. For each pixel and each time step, a factor (1 + 0.1η) was multiplied times ∆h,

where η is a Gaussian white noise with mean zero and standard deviation of one. As

previously argued, spatial and temporal variations in erodibility are a universal feature of

landscape evolution. The purpose of including this stochastic variability was to determine

its eﬀect, if any, on the morphology of the basin.

Figures 16-21 are plots of the morphologic relationships corresponding to those for real

18

river basins presented in Figure 8-13. In these plots three river basins are analyzed. The

results for the deterministic simulation of resulting in the basin of Figure 14d are presented

as the top graph. The middle graph represents the results of morphometric analyses on

the partially-developed river basin of Figure 14c. The results of the stochastic river basin

illustrated in Figure 15b are presented as the bottom graph. The results of the morphmetric

analyses on the real and model river basins are summarized in Table 1.

The same scaling relations are observed for the three model river basins, suggesting

that the scaling laws we have identiﬁed are satisﬁed by river basins continuously as they

evolve by headward growth and that they are satisﬁed even in the presence of heterogeneous

erodibility and/or runoﬀ. Close agreement between model and real river basins was observed

for most of the morphometric relationships. The scaling exponent of slope S and area A

was observed to be slightly higher for the model river networks (-0.29 to -0.32) compared to

the observed value of approximately −0.37 in real river basins. This was unexpected since

the result S ∝ A−0.37 is satisﬁed exactly for a river basin in equilibrium (where the sediment

ﬂux is everywhere constant). The reason for this discrepancy will require further study. In

addition, the Horton ratio RA and the Tokunaga exponent u quantiﬁed in Figures 20 and 21

were about 20% higher for the model basins than for the real river basins. Nevertheless, the

broad consistency between the observed relations and those satisﬁed by the model suggests

that this model captures the essential dynamics of self-organization in river basins.

The probability density function of the model basin of Figure 15a is presented in Figure

22. As observed in the Kentucky and Mississippi River basins, the hypsometry is skewed

such that the most probable elevation is lower than the median elevation. The evolution of

the hypsometric curve (cumulative distribution function) for the model basins of Figure 14a-

d is shown in Figure 23 as the top to bottom graphs, respectively. A close similarity exists

between this sequence and the evolution observed in real basins. As a example, in Figure

24 we show the hypsometric curves observed over time at Perth Amboy, New Jersey by

Schumm [1956]. Both the real and model basins begin with a nearly constant surface equal

to the maximum elevation of the basin. As the channels dissect the basin, the hypsometric

19

curve smooths out. The basins reach equilibrium with a skewed p.d.f. as evidenced by the

fact that the model and real hypsometric curves fall below 1/2 at a normalized elevation of

1/2. A Gaussian or any other symmetric distribution would pass through (1/2,1/2).

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a model of landscape evolution by overland and channel ﬂow which

reproduces many of the basic statistical features of topography and river basin morphology.

The model is based on the observation that channel and hillslope adjustment by sediment

transport can often be modeled by the diﬀusion equation with a diﬀusivity dependent on

discharge. The dependence of diﬀusivity on discharge introduces a nonlinear term in the

partial diﬀerential equation for landscape elevation which is responsible for the fractal nature

of topographic transects and results in a characteristic hypsometric curve. The morphome-

tric relationships for seven river basins have been computed and have been found to be

remarkably universal. Model drainage basins have morphologies which closely approximate

those observed in nature.

FIG. 1. Illustration of the topographic evolution with diﬀusion.

(a) The initial topographic

proﬁle at some time t, given by a Gaussian, (b) the Laplacian of the initial topography, and (c) the

initial topography (dashed line) and ﬁnal topography (solid line) after a small increment of time

according to the diﬀusion equation. The topography aggrades where the surface was concave and

is eroded where the surface was concave down. After Barabasi and Stanley [1995].

FIG. 14. Greyscale plot of the elevation of the model river network when (a) 1/8, (b) 1/4, (c)

1/2, and (d) all of the grid points of the 64 x 64 lattice has become channelized. The elevations

are mapped to brightness scale with a gamma fucntion with a coeﬃcient of 2.0.

FIG. 15. Model river networks produced after all of the grid points have become channels. The

width of the river is proportional to its order. The fully deterministic model is shown in (a). A

model run where the diﬀusivity is allowed to have a stochastic variation with a standard deviation

10% of the mean is shown in (b).

FIG. 16. Plot of average number of streams N of a given Strahler order as a function of the

average drainage area A for that Strahler order for three model river basins. The plots are oﬀset

from one another so that they may be placed on the same graph. The plots correspond, from top

to bottom, to the model river basins produced with a deterministic 64 x 64 model run until all of

the grid points were channels, a deterministic 64 x 64 model run until 50% of the grid points were

channels, and a 64 x 64 model with small (10%) stochastic varaitions in the diﬀusivity run until

all of the grid points were channels. The data indicate that N ≈ A−1, similar to that observed for

real river networks.

model river basins. Note the log-linear scale. The data indicate that Tk ∝ uk with u ≈ 100.5 ≈ 3.2.

FIG. 22. Probability density function of the model river basin of Figure 17a. The skew in this

p.d.f. is directly analagous to that of the Kentucky and Mississippi River basins of Figure 5b and

5c, respectively, and can be associated with the dependence of diﬀusivity on elevation.

time illustrated in Figure 14. Increasing time results in a smoother hypsometric curve.

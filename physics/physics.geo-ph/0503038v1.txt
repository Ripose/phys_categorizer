SUMMARY

A magneto-hydrodynamic model of boundary layers at the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB)

is derived and used to compute the viscous and electromagnetic torques generated by the

Earth’s nutation forcing. The predicted electromagnetic torque alone cannot account for

the dissipation estimated from the observations of the free core nutation. The presence of

a viscous boundary layer in the electromagnetic skin layer at the CMB, with its additional

dissipative torques, may explain the geodetic data. An apparent Ekman number at the top

of the core between 3 and 5 10−11 is inferred depending on the electrical conductivity of

the mantle.

1 INTRODUCTION

Detailed models of coupling at the Core Mantle Boundary (CMB) have been put forward to explain the

more and more accurate measurements of the nutations of the Earth (Wahr, 1981; Dehant & Defraigne, 1997;

Mathews et al., 2002). The nutations of the Earth induce a differential rotation, about an equatorial

axis, between the mantle and the core (Sasao et al., 1980; Buffett, 1992). This differential rotation

at the CMB generates both a viscous torque (Greenpan, 1968; Loper, 1975; Rochester, 1976) and

an electromagnetic torque due to the shear of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld lines (Rochester, 1960;

Toomre, 1974; Sasao, 1977). Buffett and his colleagues developed sophisticated models of the elec-

tromagnetic torque at the CMB (Buffett, 1992; Buffett, 1993; Buffett et al., 2002) in order to ﬁt the

spatial geodetic observations. First, Buffett (1992) introduced a weak magnetic ﬁeld theory where

2

the Lorentz forces associated to the skin magnetic effect are too small to generate any motion in the

boundary layer. His magnetic analysis requires the presence of a very good electrically conducting

layer in the lowermost mantle (same electrical conductivity as the core) to get an adequate ampli-

tude of the torque. Moreover, Buffett (1992) invoked a enhanced magnetic ﬁeld at the CMB (4 times

larger than the observed one) to account for the small scales of the magnetic ﬁeld. The value of the

small scales of the magnetic ﬁeld at the CMB (spherical harmonic degree l > 13) cannot be mea-

sured at the surface of the Earth because the crustal magnetic ﬁeld is dominant at these wavelengths

(Bloxham, 1995; Stacey, 1992). He estimated their effect using an extrapolation of the low-degree non

dipole part of the poloidal magnetic spectrum to higher degrees. Then, Buffett (1993) investigated the

role of a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld on the electromagnetic torque at the CMB. Its effects are weak and

do not increase the dissipation of magnetic origin at the CMB. Moreover, his results are rather spec-

ulative as measurements of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld in the Earth’s core are not available. Buffett

et al. (2002) improved the 1992’s model by relaxing the weak ﬁeld approximation. Thus, they solved

the inviscid dynamics of the skin layer in the presence of Lorentz forces. The ratio of the velocity

induced by the Lorentz forces in the skin layer and the velocity jump at the CMB is of the order of

the Elsasser number (deﬁned below). Its value, at the top of the core, is comprised between 0.1 and

1 so that the weak ﬁeld approximation is not valid. The presence of this dynamical effect reduces the

amplitude of the electromagnetic torque at the CMB. This is the reason why, in order to ﬁt the im-

proved observational constraints (Mathews et al., 2002), Buffett et al. (2002) invoked the presence of

a constant magnetic ﬁeld modeling the non dipole component (small scale magnetic ﬁeld), three times

greater than the dipole value at the CMB. In all their studies, Buffett and his colleagues introduced a

thin electrically conducting layer at the base of the mantle. Its presence remains necessary to get the

correct amplitude of the electromagnetic torque.

For rapidly rotating ﬂuids, viscosity plays a role mainly in thin boundary layers, the so-called

Ekman layers (Greenpan, 1968). The depth of these layers is

ν/Ω where ν is the kinematic viscosity

of the ﬂuid and Ω the angular velocity of the Earth. As the magnetic skin depth is

η/Ω, where η is

the magnetic diffusivity of the core, the ratio of the two lengths is given by √Pm where Pm = ν/η

p

p

is the magnetic Prandtl number. Table 1 contains the values of the molecular diffusivities for the core
(Poirier, 1994). We evaluate Pm = 4 10−6 in the core, making the viscous layer 500 times thinner
than the magnetic skin layer.

Recent numerical simulations of the geodynamo have been successful in reproducing some fea-

tures of the magnetic ﬁeld of the Earth (Dormy et al., 2000). They have in common to use a very high
viscosity (Ekman number greater than 10−6) so as to avoid numerical resolution problems. Glatzmaier

& Roberts (1995) advocated the use of an eddy viscosity for dynamical core modeling as it is gener-

ally done in numerical modeling of the oceanic or atmospheric sciences (Pedlovsky, 1987). Brito at

al. (2004) have found evidence of apparent viscosity from an experiment of thermal convection in a

rapidly rotating spherical shell ﬁlled with water using a spin-up technique. They interpret their obser-

vations by arguing that turbulent motions in the bulk of the core increase the efﬁciency of the exchange

of angular momentum between the Ekman layers and the geostrophic volume. These non-linear ef-

fects at small scale may be modeled by an eddy viscosity at large scale. A turbulent viscosity at the
top of the core between 10−4 m2 s−1 and 10−1 m2 s−1 is possible. Such eddy viscosities increase the

magnetic Prandtl number and decreases the ratio between the ”viscous” and magnetic layer depths.

Under these conditions, viscous effects have to be incorporated in the dynamical equation of the layer.

With such a theory, the quality factor of the free core nutation, deduced from the geodetic data, is a

constraint on the apparent viscosity et the top of the core for the diurnal frequency.

Recently, two related studies (Mathews & Guo, 2005; Palmer & Smylie, 2005) have been pub-

lished. Their approaches are very similar to the work presented here and lead also to the prediction

of a viscosity value at the top of the core from nutations data. From their own data analysis, Palmer

& Smylie (2005) use a pure viscous model to infer a viscosity. Mathews & Guo (2005) introduce a

magneto-viscous model similar to ours and determine the viscosity from the observational data analy-

sis of Mathews et al. (2002). Both papers give a value of viscosity which is close to the one proposed

in this paper. However, our analysis proposes a complete calculation with all spectral components of

the magnetic ﬁeld with different extrapolated tendencies for the hidden part (l > 13) of the magnetic

4

ﬁeld at the CMB. Moreover, a physical description of the magnetic and viscous boundary layers is

shown. We also give a complete study of the variations of the electrical conductivity at the base of

the mantle which enables us to invert the observational data to obtain trade-offs between the mantle

electrical conductivity effect and the viscous effect at the CMB.

This paper presents a derivation of a magneto-hydrodynamic boundary layer attached to the mantle

taking into account the Lorentz, Coriolis and viscous forces (section 2). In section 3, we discuss

the inﬂuence of the geometry (small scales) and amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld at the CMB on the

electromagnetic torque. Section 4 describes the effects of a viscous layer on the visco-magnetic torques

at the CMB and an Ekman number is estimated at the top of the core. The variations of the electrical

conductivity in the lowermost mantle are studied in section 5. A ﬁnal discussion ends the paper.

2 MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF THE TORQUES

At ﬁrst order (Poincar´e, 1910), the response of the rotating ﬂuid core to Earth’s nutations is a rigid body

rotation. This approximation was checked experimentally (Vanyo et al., 1995) and stays valid for large

forcings (Noir et al., 2003). In the computation of the torques at the core mantle boundary (CMB), we

may neglect the ﬂow induced by the ellipticity of the CMB (Sasao et al., 1980; Buffett et al., 2002)
and we describe the main ﬂow in the outer core by an angular velocity Ω. We consider the magneto-
hydrodynamical equations in the frame of reference (ex, ey, ez) rotating with the ﬂuid outer core at
the angular velocity vector Ω, ez being deﬁned by ez = Ω/Ω. The equations are made dimensionless
using Ω−1 as time scale, R the radius of the core as length scale and a typical magnitude of the radial

component of the magnetic ﬁeld B0 as magnetic ﬁeld scale. The magnetic ﬁeld and the ﬂow velocity

in the core (r < 1) are governed by the following dimensionless equations:

When δωM = 0, the solution of (1) and (4) is a diffusive poloidal magnetic ﬁeld denoted B0. As
δωM increases, magneto-viscous boundary layers develop around the core mantle boundary (r = 1).
The induced magnetic ﬁeld in these boundary layers is denoted b. As δωM << 1, we have b <<

hydrodynamic equations in the boundary layers. Moreover, B0 and vM have no radial variation inside
these thin boundary layers. A linearisation of equations (1),(2),(4) with the above boundary layer

For a very weak magnetic ﬁeld (the Lorentz forces tend to vanish) Toomre (1974) predicted that
the torque is pointing π/4 away from the direction of the imposed angular velocity δω. For very low

Elsasser and Ekman numbers, the solution follows this asymptotic behavior (Im(K) =

Re(K)).

−

For a large and dipolar magnetic ﬁeld, we compare successfully our results for a very low Ekman
number (E = 10−16) with the coupling constants found by Buffett (2002) in their inviscid study. In

the limit of large Ekman numbers and low Elsasser numbers, we check that the computed torque tends

toward the spin-over torque (Greenpan, 1968).

3 MAGNETIC FIELD AT THE CMB

Even though the magnetic ﬁeld at the CMB is dominated by the axial dipole component, all spherical

harmonic components contribute to the electromagnetic torque. The spectrum of the observed mag-

netic energy at the CMB is ﬁtted by a power law in (0.959)l (Stacey, 1992) if one excepts the dipole

component (l = 1). This is a relatively ﬂat magnetic spectrum which has to become stiffer at very

large l to satisfy energetic arguments (Roberts et al., 2003; Christensen & Tilgner, 2004). Taking the
m = 1.8 10−9) and a very low
same electrical conductivity for the core and the mantle (Em = EM
Ekman number (E = 10−16), we compute the electromagnetic coupling constant using the ﬁrst lmax
degrees of the magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 1 illustrates possible contributions of the small scales (l > 13) of

the magnetic ﬁeld to the amplitude of the electromagnetic torque. Different random sets of spherical

harmonic coefﬁcients matching the spectra dependence, give comparable contribution to the torque.

Consequently, the mean value of the coupling constant is representative of what could happen at the

CMB and in the following, we keep only the mean value to present the results.

The contribution of the large degrees of the spherical harmonics of the magnetic ﬁeld in the visco-

magnetic model is smaller that the one associated with the weak ﬁeld model (Buffett, 1992). The back

reaction of the Lorentz forces on the ﬂow is to reduce the electromagnetic torque at the boundary.

model with three different extrapolated spectra for l > 13.

This effect is emphasised for the small scales of the magnetic ﬁeld. In some cases (for example, all

coefﬁcients positive), the contribution of the large degree is negligeable and the coupling constant

curve becomes ﬂat (highest curve in Figure 1).

Figure 2 shows that the mean electromagnetic torque associated with the observed magnetic

ﬁeld at the CMB ((0.959)l) is too low to ﬁt the imaginary part of the observed coupling constant
1.85 10−5). Following the ideas of Buffett (1992; 2002), we explore the effect of an increase of the
(
−
magnetic ﬁeld at small scales . We studied two different power laws for the spectra (l > 13): (1.044)l

giving an energy 10 times greater than the standard one at degree 40, and (1.098)l corresponding to an

energy 10 times greater than the standard one at degree 30. An increase by a factor 10 in energy at de-

gree 40, increases the overall coupling constant less than a factor 2 which remains too small to match

the observed value. In Figure 2, we see that only the largest spectrum could explain the observed data.

From a geophysical point of view, the largest spectrum is unlikely as it dissipates a large amount of

energy. Using the result of Roberts et al. (2003), we found a ohmic dissipation of 0.03T W for l < 40.

Another dissipative process is thus needed to explain the nutation data.

4 VISCOUS EFFECTS AT THE CMB

In this section, we assume the electrical conductivity in the core and in the mantle to be the same

(Buffett et al., 2002) and focus on viscous effects. Figure 3 shows components of the velocity and
m = 1.8 10−9 (see table 1) and differ-
perturbed magnetic ﬁelds in the boundary layers for Em = EM
ent Ekman numbers. For very low Ekman numbers, the viscous layer is very narrow (E1/2) and the

magnetic ﬁeld (symmetry and amplitude) is nearly unchanged by the presence of the Ekman layer.

For Ekman numbers comparable to the magnetic Ekman number, the width of the viscous layer be-
comes as large as the magnetic skin depth (E1/2

m ) and magnetic ﬁeld is induced deeper into the core.

Consequently, the perturbed magnetic ﬁeld looses its symmetry and its value at the CMB decreases.

This physical behavior is summarised on ﬁgure 4. The magnetic torque does not vary for very
low Ekman number (E < 10−11) and both components decrease as the Ekman number approaches

imaginary part of the magnetic and viscous coupling constants become comparable for E

the magnetic Ekman number. As expected, the viscous torque increases with the Ekman number. The

while their real parts match for a larger Ekman number (E

from the geometry of the spin over viscous torque which exhibits a very low imaginary part (0.259)

compared to the real one (2.62) (Greenpan, 1968). As a conclusion, the resulting torque at the CMB is
largely modiﬁed by a viscous shear layer for E > 10−12 even if the depth of the viscous layer is much

smaller than the magnetic one (Figure 3a) and its effect barely changes the induced magnetic ﬁeld at

the boundary (Figure 3b).

In order to ﬁt the imaginary part of the observed coupling constant (

1.85 10−5), an Ekman
number of 4. 10−11 is necessary as shown on ﬁgure 4. With such a value, the viscous dissipative

−

process represents 85% of the whole dissipation at the CMB but the real part of the coupling constant

is still dominated (75%) by the magnetic torque.

5 ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MANTLE

In the visco-magnetic model for CMB parameters, the inﬂuence of the electrical conductivity of the

lowermost mantle is secondary. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the coupling constant as the electrical

resistivity is increased up to 10000 times the electrical resistivity of the core for an Ekman number
of 3. 10−11. The imaginary part of the coupling constant varies less than 20% but the real part of the

coupling constant is divided by 3. As expected, for large magnetic Ekman number in the mantle, the

torque is mainly dominated by the viscous part of the torque.

A trade off between viscous and magnetic torque could be found in order to ﬁt the observational

data of nutations. On ﬁgure 6, for each value of the electrical conductivity of the mantle (EM

Ekman numbers vary more signiﬁcantly with the conductivity of the lowermost mantle and very low

Ekman numbers are retrieved when the electromagnetic torque becomes signiﬁcant (comparable elec-

trical conductivity on both sides of the CMB).

The electrical conductivity at the bottom of the mantle is difﬁcult to determine. Theoretical anal-

ysis and experimental measurements indicate that silicate rocks have a lower electrical conductivity

than the liquid metal of the core (Poirier & Le Mou¨el, 1992; Shankland & Poirier, 1993). Discoveries

of new phases of perovskite, such as post perovskite (Iitaka et al., 2004), or metal alloys of silicates

may change this statement. The resistivity may even present lateral variations as shown by seismic lat-

eral variations in the lowermost mantle (Lay et al., 1998). Except in the case of both a large electrical

conductivity at the base of the mantle and a large magnitude of a hidden magnetic ﬁeld at the CMB,
the Ekman number needed to explain the observational data is around 10−11.

6 DISCUSSION

The real part of the coupling constant is not dissipative and directly inﬂuences the period of the nu-

tations (Dehant & Defraigne, 1997; Hinderer & Crossley, 2000; Mathews et al., 2002) and could have

been used to determine the nature of the dissipative process at the CMB. But the discrepancy between

the theoretical and observed periods of the free core nutation (FCN) is too large to be explained only

by the dissipative torque at the CMB. Hence, a dynamic ellipticity of a few hundred meters at the

CMB has been introduced to account for this discrepancy. Then, the real part of the coupling constant

cannot be used anymore as an observational constraint to determine the nature of the dissipative torque

at the CMB. It is true, though, that a visco-magnetic dynamic model of the CMB reduces the real part

of the coupling constant compared to a weak ﬁeld model and consequently tends to increase by 10%

the estimate of the dynamic ellipticity at the CMB.

The non-linear model of the magnetic skin layer shows that the small scales of the magnetic ﬁeld

at the CMB, that cannot be directly inferred from magnetic observations, do not contribute signiﬁ-

cantly to the electromagnetic torque between the core and the mantle. With a ﬂat or decreasing power

magnetic spectrum at the CMB, the electromagnetic torque is too weak to explain the coupling con-

The visco-magnetic model of the boundary layers at the CMB using the observed geomagnetic

ﬁeld imposes the presence of viscous dissipative effects. Apparent Ekman numbers between 3 and
5 10−11 are needed to ﬁt the observational constraint (corresponding to a turbulent viscosity of
3.5 10−2m2s−1). This observational constraint may change as the quality of the data and their treat-
ment improve (Florsch & Hinderer, 2000). Only a reduction of the value of Im(K CM B) by a factor

3 would make viscous effects unnecessary to explain the observations. However, the recent study
of Palmer & Smylie (2005) gives an Ekman number of 7 10−11 using their own analysis of VLBI

data of the free core nutation and a pure viscous model of coupling at the CMB. The agreement is

also very good with the results of Mathews & Guo (2005) which states that an Ekman number larger
than 5 10−11 is needed at the CMB. Such values of the Ekman number at the CMB are also com-

patible with the dissipation needed to account for the relaxation of torsional oscillations in the core

(Zatman & Bloxham, 1997; Jault, 2003).

At this stage, we like to see this observational constraint as a measurement of an apparent viscosity

Geophys. J. Int.: Visco-magnetic Torque at the CMB

at the top of the core. The visco-magnetic model suggests an effective viscosity ﬁve thousand times

larger than the expected molecular viscosity of iron at the core conditions. We would like to stress than

an apparent viscosity is space and time dependent whereas, it is deﬁned here on the whole surface of
the CMB at the diurnal frequency. Consequently, this value of viscosity (3.5 10−2m2s−1) may not

be generalized to the bulk of the core, at small scales and at different time scales. This is large but

comparable to effective viscosities used in ﬂuid dynamics of the ocean or the atmosphere. In these

ﬁelds, a large apparent viscosity is the net result of the turbulent transport due to the small scales of

the ﬂow on the large scale ﬂow. Such an explanation may be valid in the Earth’s core even though we

do not have any evidence for the action of small scales at the CMB. As discussed by Davies & Whaler

(1997), the effective transport of momentum may be generated by convective motions associated to the

dynamo process or by surfacic ﬂows such as topographic winds, unstable boundary layers motions, or

chemical/compositional ﬂuxes.

This work has been ﬁnanced by the program DyETI and PNP of CNRS/INSU. The authors would

like to thank Thierry Alboussi`ere and Dominique Jault for very helpful comments and suggestions.

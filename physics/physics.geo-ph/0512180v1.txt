Low-degree mantle convection with strongly temperature- and depth-dependent
viscosity in a three-dimensional spherical shell

Yokohama 236-0001, Japan.

A series of numerical simulations of thermal convection of Boussinesq ﬂuid with inﬁnite Prandtl
number, with Rayleigh number 107, and with the strongly temperature- and depth- dependent vis-
cosity in a three-dimensional spherical shell is carried out to study the mantle convection of single-
plate terrestrial planets like Venus or Mars without an Earth-like plate tectonics. The strongly
temperature-dependent viscosity (the viscosity contrast across the shell is ≥ 105) make the con-
vection under stagnant-lid short-wavelength structures. Numerous, cylindrical upwelling plumes are
developed because of the secondary downwelling plumes arising from the bottom of lid. This convec-
tion pattern is inconsistent with that inferred from the geodesic observation of the Venus or Mars.
Additional eﬀect of the stratiﬁed viscosity at the upper/lower mantle (the viscosity contrast is varied
from 30 to 300) are investigated. It is found that the combination of the strongly temperature- and
depth-dependent viscosity causes long-wavelength structures of convection in which the spherical
harmonic degree ℓ is dominant at 1–4. The geoid anomaly calculated by the simulated convections
shows a long-wavelength structure, which is compared with observations. The degree-one (ℓ = 1)
convection like the Martian mantle is realized in the wide range of viscosity contrast from 30 to 100
when the viscosity is continuously increased with depth at the lower mantle.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Single-plate terrestrial planets like Venus and Mars without an Earth-like plate tectonics is covered by a thick
immobile lithosphere, or cold stiﬀ lid. It is inferred from the geodesic observations (topography and gravity) of Venus
[Rappaport et al., 1999; Konopliv et al., 1999] and Mars [Smith et al., 1999a; 1999b] that the spatial structure of the
thermal convection under the lid has relatively long-wavelength in which the spherical harmonic degree is dominant
at ℓ = 2–3 or lower [e.g., Schubert et al., 1990; 1997]. In particular, as for the Mars, it is generally accepted that
the Martian crustal dichotomy was caused by a convection system dominated by ℓ = 1 [e.g., Sleep, 1994; Zhong and
Zuber, 2001].

In numerical simulation of mantle convection in the three-dimensional (3-D) Cartesian box geometry with wide
aspect ratios [Tackley, 1996a; Ratcliﬀ et al., 1997, Trompert and Hansen, 1998] and in the spherical shell geometry
[Ratcliﬀ et al., 1996; 1997], it is shown that a highly viscous lid is formed when the temperature-dependent viscosity
is included in their models with the stress-free boundary condition on the top surface. As the viscosity contrast goes
up to 104–105, an immobile highly viscous layer (stagnant-lid) is formed. The convection under the stagnant-lid is
characterized by numerous, small-scale cylindrical plumes surrounded by sheet-like downwellings [Ratcliﬀ et al., 1996;
1997; Reese et al., 1999]. These convection patterns with high-degree modes are apparently inconsistent with the
observations.

Here we explore the possibility that the low-degree convection under a stagnant-lid is induced by the depth-
dependent viscosity due to the higher viscous lower mantle. The dynamical eﬀects of a stratiﬁed viscosity proﬁle
on the mantle convection without lateral viscosity variations have been studied by the two-dimensional (2-D) or 3-D
Cartesian [e.g., Hansen et al., 1993; Tackley, 1996b] and by the spherical shell [Zhang and Yuen, 1995; Bunge et al.,
1996; Zhong et al., 2000b] models. Bunge et al.
[1996] have shown that a modest increase in the mantle viscosity
with depth has a remarkable eﬀect on the convection pattern, resulting in a long-wavelength structure. However,
another important factor for the mantle viscosity, i.e., the strong dependence on temperature, was absent in their
models. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the combined eﬀects of (i) depth-dependence and (ii) strong
temperature-dependence on the viscosity in the resulting convection pattern.

II. SIMULATION MODEL

The mantle convection is numerically treated as a thermal convection in a 3-D spherical shell of a Boussinesq ﬂuid
with inﬁnite Prandtl number heated from the bottom boundary. The aspect ratio of the spherical shell ˆr0/ˆr1 is 0.55,
which is a characteristic value of the terrestrial planets, where ˆr0 and ˆr1 are the radii of the inner and outer spheres,
respectively. Equations of mass, momentum, and energy conservation governing the mantle convection are scaled to

a non-dimensional form as follows [e.g., Schubert et al., 2001],

∇ · v = 0,

where v is the velocity vector, p pressure, T temperature, t time, and er is the unit vector in the r-direction. The
superscript tr indicates the tensor transpose. The Rayleigh number Ra scaled by the thickness of the spherical shell
ˆD is given by,

where ˆρ is the density, ˆg gravitational acceleration, ˆα thermal expansivity, ∆ ˆT (= ˆTbot− ˆTtop) the temperature diﬀerence
between the bottom temperature ˆTbot on the inner sphere and the top temperature ˆTtop on the outer sphere, ˆκ thermal
diﬀusivity, and ˆηref is the reference viscosity (see equation (6) below). The hats stand for dimensional quantities.

where ˆQ is the internal heating rate per unit mass, and ˆcp is the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure. In this study, in
order to focus on the eﬀects of the temperature- and depth-dependent viscosity, all the material properties other than
viscosity (such as thermal expansivity and thermal diﬀusivity) are assumed to be constant. The viscosity η depends
on the temperature T and depth d as

η(T, d) = ηref (d) exp [−E (T − Tref )] ,

where ηref (d) is the viscosity at the reference temperature T = Tref . The non-dimensional “activation parameter” E
represents the degree of viscosity contrast between the top and bottom surfaces. The velocity boundary at the top
and bottom surfaces of the spherical shell are given by impermeable and the stress-free conditions. The boundary
conditions for T at the top and bottom surfaces are given by Tbot = 1 and Ttop = 0.

The basic equations (1)–(3) are solved by a second-order ﬁnite diﬀerence discretization. A kind of the overset
(Chimera) grid system, Yin-Yang grid [Kageyama and Sato, 2004], is used for the computational grid (Figure 1). The
Yin-Yang grid is composed of two component grids (Yin grid and Yang grid) that have exactly the same shape and
size (Figure 1a). A component grid of the Yin-Yang grid is a low-latitude part of the usual latitude-longitude grid
on the spherical polar coordinates. The Yin-Yang grid is suitable to solve the mantle convection problems because
it automatically avoids the pole problems, i.e., the coordinate singularity and grid convergence that are inevitable in
the usual latitude-longitude grid (Figure 1b). Following the general overset grid method, the data on the boarder of
each component grid are matched by mutual interpolation. All the basic quantities—v, p, T , and η—are spatially
discretized and located in the same grid points (collocation grid method). The details of the Yin-Yang grid can be
found in Kageyama and Sato [2004]. See our previous paper [Yoshida and Kageyama, 2004] for its application to the
mantle convection with detailed benchmark and validation tests.

The grid points in each component grid are 102 × 54 × 158 (in r-, θ-, and φ-directions). Thus the total grid size
for a whole spherical shell is 102 × 54 × 158 × 2 (for Yin and Yang grids). The convergences of the solutions were
conﬁrmed by changing the numerical resolution with 66 × 33 × 104 × 2. Time development of the convections are
calculated until averaged quantities, such as Nusselt number and root-mean-square velocity, become stationary.

Calculations carried out in this paper are summarized in Table. 1.

A. Constant viscosity and only temperature-dependent viscosity convections

Before we go into details of the combined eﬀects of the temperature- and depth-dependent viscosity on the convec-
tion, we study the phenomenology of convection pattern changes caused only by the temperature-dependent viscosity.
Figure 2a shows a snapshot of the residual temperature of Case r7e0 in Table 1, in which the viscosity is constant,
i.e., E = 0 in equation (6). The Rayleigh number Ra is 107, which is about one order of magnitude smaller than the
value of terrestrial planets. (Later, we will show that the convective pattern is unchanged even when the Rayleigh
number is increased 108 in Case r8e6w2.) The thermal structure of Figure 2a shows a typical pattern observed in
the 3-D spherical shell geometry. The convective ﬂow is composed of narrow, cylindrical upwelling (hot) plumes
surrounded by a network of long downwelling (cold) sheets. This structure is common for the purely bottom-heated
convection. To analyze the spatial structure, the power spectrum by the spherical harmonics Y m
ℓ of temperature ﬁeld
is plotted in the right panels of Figure 2. The small scale structure (ℓ ≥ 10) is dominant in the middle depth, and
the large scale structure (ℓ ≤ 6) is dominant near the top and bottom surfaces that is associated with the thermal
boundary layers. The radial proﬁle of horizontally averaged temperature is shown in Figure 3a. The volume-averaged
temperature is 0.26 in this case. As we expect, compared with the convections with high Rayleigh number and the
strong internal heating [Bunge et al., 1996; Yoshida et al., 1999; Zhong et al., 2000b], the thermal structure of this
purely bottom-heated convection are dominated by considerably long-wavelength structure.

Figure 2b shows the results of Case r7e6r where the reference temperature Tref = 0.5. The activation parameter
is taken to be E = ln(106) = 13.8155. The spectrum of temperature ﬁeld of Case r7e6r (right panel of Figure 2b)
shows that the power is concentrated around ℓ = 6–10 throughout the depth that is associated with convecting cells
under the stagnant-lid. For this case, the volume averaged temperature is 0.72, which is larger than the constant
viscosity convection (Figure 3b).

In our previous paper [Yoshida and Kageyama, 2004], we did not report the cases when the viscosity of mantle
materials has a strong temperature dependence. The regime of the ﬂow state under the strong temperature-dependent
viscosity in the spherical shell convection was examined by Ratcliﬀ et al. [1996; 1997]. For the comparison with the
previous works, the reference temperature Tref in equation (6) is ﬁxed to the bottom temperature Tbot in the followings.
Therefore, the viscosity ηref is now the viscosity at the bottom. The viscosity contrast across the spherical shell is
deﬁned by γη ≡ η(Ttop)/η(Tbot) = exp(E).

Shown in Figure 4a is a regime diagram for convective ﬂow pattern. Approximate regime boundaries are drawn.
Our simulation results for Rabot = 106–107 are shown in this diagram. The previous results by Ratcliﬀ et al. [1997]
(3-D Cartesian and spherical shell models) and Trompert and Hansen [1998] (3-D Cartesian model) are also included
in the diagram. Our results basically support the previous results by Ratcliﬀ et al.
[1996; 1997]: The convecting
pattern is classiﬁed into three regimes deﬁned by Solomatov [1995] in the order of increasing γη; the “mobile-lid”
regime (Figure 4b); the “sluggish-lid” regime (Figure 4c); and the “stagnant-lid” regime (Figure 4d).

The moderate viscosity contrast (γη = 103–104) produces the large-scale convection, or the sluggish-lid regime.
In our previous paper [Yoshida and Kageyama, 2004], we showed that the convection at Rabot = 106 and γη = 104
(Case r6e4) has a two cell pattern that consists of one downwelling and two cylindrical upwellings (Figure 4b) [Ratcliﬀ
et al., 1995; 1996; 1997, Zhong et al., 2000b; Yoshida and Kageyama, 2004; Stemmer et al., 2004; McNamara and
Zhong, 2005a]. In contrast, at Rabot = 107 and γη = 104 (Case r7e4), the convection pattern comes to have the
degree-one pattern; the one cell structure that consists of a pair of cylindrical downwelling plume and cylindrical
upwelling plume (Figure 4c). This indicates that the convecting structure in the sluggish-lid regime is sensible to the
Rayleigh number.

The convective ﬂow pattern that belongs to the stagnant-lid regime emerges when γη ≥ 105. The stagnant-lid
prevents the heat ﬂux through the top boundary and leads to a small temperature diﬀerence in the mantle below the
lid. The characteristic horizontal thermal structure has short wavelengths comparable to the thickness of the mantle
(Figures 4d and 4e). This convective pattern in the stagnant-lid regime is also observed in the previous results in a
3-D spherical shell geometry [e.g., Reese et al., 1999b]. This convective feature would be caused by the secondary
downwelling plumes leaving from the base of stagnant-lid. At γη ≥ 106 (Cases r7e6), the connected network of
sheet-like downwelling reaches to the mid depth of convecting layer (Figure 4d). When γη is further increased to
108 (Cases r7e8 and r7eA), the stagnant-lid become rather thick, and we clearly observe large, mushroom-shaped
upwelling plumes (Figure 4e).

B. Both temperature- and depth-dependent viscosity convections

To investigate the transition in the convective pattern by adding the depth-dependent viscosity (a viscosity stratiﬁ-
cation), we investigate two kinds of viscosity proﬁles. First we examine cases in which the viscosity jumps at the phase
transition boundary between the upper and lower mantle. Second we examine cases in which the viscosity smoothly

4

increases with depth in the lower mantle. The ratio of thickness between lower and upper mantle, dL/dU , is 3.39,
comparable to that in Earth’s mantle. Since the actual viscosity contrast in the depth of the terrestrial planets is not
fully constrained, we take it as a parameter within a plausible range between 101.5 (≈ 30) ≤ ηL/ηref ≤ 102.5 (≈ 300)
[e.g., Davies and Richards, 1992; Karato, 2003] where ηL is the viscosity of lower mantle. In six cases (Cases r7e6v1
to r7e6v3, and Cases r7e6w1 to r7e6w3), the initial condition is taken from the stationary state of Case r7e6r, shown
in Figure 2b. The reference temperature Tref in equation (6) is ﬁxed at 0.5. The Rayleigh number deﬁned by ηref is
ﬁxed at 107.

Shown in Figure 5 are the results of three cases (Cases r7e6v1, r7e6v2, and r7e6v3) in which the viscosity jumps
at the upper/lower mantle boundary. Figure 5a shows a snapshot of the residual temperature of Case r7e6v1 with
ηL/ηref = 101.5. Compared with the convection in which the viscosity depends only on the temperature (Figure 2b),
we ﬁnd that the convective ﬂow pattern obviously has longer length scale. The thermal spectrum indicates a shift
to smaller degrees, and the peak is located between ℓ = 2 and ≈ 10. As ηL/ηref is further increased (Cases r7e6v2
shown in Figure 5b and r7e6v3 in Figure 5c), the thermal structure signiﬁcantly shifts to lower modes. The power
spectrum shows a concentration in ℓ ≤ 6 with the peak of ℓ = 2–4 for ηL/ηref = 102.0 (Figure 5b), and ℓ = 2–3
for ηL/ηref = 102.5 (Figure 5c) throughout the depth. As the amount of the viscosity jump ηL/ηref increases, the
temperature drop in the bottom thermal boundary layer grows, which leads to the lower internal temperature of the
mantle (Figure 6).

To see this spatial scale change of the convection caused by the depth-dependent viscosity in more detail, we
analyzed the time sequence of the Nusselt number, the root-mean-square velocity averaged over the entire mantle,
and the peak mode at each depth for the Case r7e6v3 with ηL/ηref = 102.5. At the initial stage of the simulation run,
the convection is dominated by ℓ = 7–9 modes throughout the depth which reﬂects the initial condition (Figure 2b).
As time goes on, the convective ﬂow reaches to a saturated state (Figure 7a), and the low-degree component develops
from the upper part to middle part of mantle; the peak mode shifts from ℓ = 9 to 3 there (Figure 7b). This indicates
that the stagnant-lid is broken, and then, the convection cells are re-organized into the convection state with the low
modes.

To compare with the observation, we have calculated the geoid anomaly for Cases r7e6v1 to r7e6v3. We followed
the method of the calculation of the geoid anomaly described in Hager and Clayton [1989]. The physical parameters
used in the calculation are set to those possibly relevant to Venus (Table 2). Figure 8 shows the distribution of
calculated geoid anomaly where ηL/ηref is (a) 1 (i.e., no viscosity stratiﬁcation), (b) 101.5, (c) 102.0, and (d) 102.5.
The results are shown by the spherical harmonics modes up to ℓ = 24. Figure 8e shows the power spectrum for
each case. The mode amplitude with the viscosity stratiﬁcation peaks at ℓ = 2–4. When the stratiﬁed viscosity is
absent (Figure 8a), ℓ = 5–10 modes are strong (see the arrow in Figure 8e). On the other hand, as ηL/ηref increases
(Figures 8c and 8d), the power spectrum peaks at ℓ = 2 and the higher degree components (ℓ ≥ 10) are remarkably
decreased. This is consistent with the spectrum constructed from the observed geoid anomaly of the Venus [Konopliv
et al., 1999] (Figure 8e).

Next, we investigate the cases with smoothly increased viscosity with depth rather than the jump. In three cases
(Cases r7e6w1, r7e6w2, and r7e6w3) shown in Figure 9, the viscosity contrast between the upper/lower mantle
boundary and the bottom of mantle is ∆ηL = (a) 101.5, (b) 102, and (c) 102.5. The initial condition is again the
state shown in Figure 2b. We see from both the residual temperature and the spectrum that the dominant power is
concentrated on the smaller degrees in all the cases. At ∆ηL = 101.5–102, the peak is located at ℓ = 1, or one-cell
convection (Figures 9a and 9b). On the other hand, at ∆ηL = 102.5, the peak is located at ℓ = 2, or the two-cell
convection (Figure 9c). The horizontally averaged temperature and viscosity proﬁle is shown in Figure 10. Note
that the viscosity contrast in the lid are almost identical among the three cases (see the arrow in the right panel
of Figure 10). This suggests that the transition between degree-one and degree-two convection is sensitive to the
magnitude of the viscosity stratiﬁcation. We found that the patterns (degree-one or degree-two) are not aﬀected by
the increase of E up to 8 (Case r7e8w2) or to 10 (Case r7eAw2). This pattern is also unchanged when the internal
heating is included (H = 20) (Case r7e6w2h), or the Rayleigh number is increased to 108 (Case r8e6w2). The patterns
ℓ = 1 or 2 are mainly controlled by the viscosity contrast ∆ηL.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The convection with strongly temperature dependent viscosity under the stress-free boundary condition has short
wavelength structure when the depth-dependent viscosity is ignored. This feature is inconsistent with the convection
inferred from the geodesic observations on the single-plate planets like Venus and Mars. We have found that the
combination of temperature- and depth-dependent viscosity produces the convection with the spherical harmonics
degree ℓ = 1–4. The geoid anomaly calculated from these simulation data also generates large scale length, which
is consistent with the observation. Schubert et al.
[1990; 1997] have shown that convections with rigid boundary

5

condition on the top surface can lead to ℓ = 1–3 structures. In their model, however, the viscosity of ﬂuid is spatially
constant. Our ﬁnding is that, by considering more realistic viscosity proﬁles, the low-degree pattern can be reproduced
in the convection model with stress-free boundary condition on the top surface.

The previous convection models without the temperature-dependent viscosity [e.g., Hansen et al., 1993; Zhang
and Yuen, 1995; Bunge et al., 1996] have already produced the large scale ﬂow pattern by considering the viscosity
stratiﬁcation. This could be explained by the enhanced value of viscosity in the lower mantle. In our model with
strongly temperature-dependent viscosity, the large scale convection seems to be realized by the change of convecting
regime, from the stagnant-lid regime into the sluggish-lid regime, which is caused by the viscosity stratiﬁcation. A
major diﬀerence between their results and ours is that a highly viscous lid is naturally formed on the top owing to
the inclusion of the temperature-dependent viscosity eﬀect in this study.

To date, several mechanisms have been proposed for the degree-one convection of the Martian mantle. For example,
the endothermic phase transition just above core-mantle boundary in Martian mantle with the rigid boundary condi-
tion [Harder and Christensen, 1996; Breuer et al., 1998; Harder, 1998], and a priori high-viscous lid [Harder, 2000] on
the top surface boundary without any phase transitions. The small core, in other words, the thicker convecting shells
of the mantle may lead to the degree-one convection in the ancient Mars [Schubert et al., 1990] and the Moon [Zhong
et al., 2000a]. McNamara and Zhong [2005a] have recently found that the internal heating plays a role in increasing
ﬂow wavelength and forming the degree-one convection in convections in which the viscosity moderately depends on
temperature. One of our ﬁndings in this paper is that the degree-one convection can be relatively easily reproduced
when both eﬀects of the temperature- and depth-dependence on the viscosity are taken into account. Although the
degree-one convection appears even when the depth-dependence is absent (Figure 4c), the parameter range for this
pattern is rather narrow; it is sensitive to the Rayleigh number. On the other hand, when the viscosity in the lower
mantle is continuously increased with depth, the degree-one (ℓ = 1) convection like the Martian mantle is realized in
the wide range of viscosity contrast from 30 to 100.

It is an interesting possibility that the transition of the convecting patterns between low-degree convective mode
and one-degree mode took place in the planets. We have not directly observed the transition of convecting mode in
our simulations. The physical parameters (Ra and/or E in this study) to characterize the convective pattern are ﬁxed
in our simulations. However, we would like to point out again a drastic diﬀerence of the convection patterns between
relatively close conditions: the convection of degree-two at Ra = 106 (Figure 4b) [Yoshida and Kageyama, 2004], and
the convection of degree-one at Ra = 107 (Figure 4c). This sensitive change has not been reported so far.

Our simulation results will not be directly applied to the Earth’s mantle, because the eﬀects of the plate tectonics
would be comparable to the eﬀects of the depth-dependent viscosity, as proposed by Bunge and Richards [1996]
and Bunge et al. [1996; 1998] from their model without temperature-dependent viscosity. Existence of a stationary
continental lithosphere [Yoshida et al., 1999], a drifting continental lithosphere [Phillips and Bunge, 2005], and plate
motion on the top surface boundary [Zhong et al., 2000b] also transform the small scale convection patterns in high
Rayleigh number convection into the large scale convection patterns.

(*1) “I.C.” indicates the Initial conditions. (*2) “Case r7e6w2h” is a case with internal heating (see text).

The values are referred with Schubert et al. [1990], Solomatov and Moresi [1996], and Turcotte and Schubert [2002].

FIG. 1: The Yin-Yang grid. Two component grids of the Yin-Yang grid are identical (the same shape and size): (a) The low
latitude part (π/4 ≤ θ ≤ 3π/4, −3π/4 ≤ φ ≤ 3π/4) of the latitude-longitude grid. (b) They partially overlap each other on
their boarders to cover a spherical surface in pair. As it is apparent, the Yin-Yang grid has neither a coordinate singularity,
nor grid convergence; the grid spacings are quasi-uniforms on the sphere.

10

FIG. 2: The iso-surface of residual temperature δT (i.e., the deviation from horizontally averaged temperature at each depth),
and the power spectrum of the spherical harmonics of temperature ﬁeld at each depth. (a) Case r7e0 with the constant viscosity
(i.e., E = 0) convection and (b) Case r7e6r with the strongly temperature-dependent viscosity (E = ln 106) are shown. Blue
iso-surfaces indicate δT = (a) −0.10 and (b) −0.15. Yellow indicate δT = (a) +0.10 and (b) +0.15. The logarithmic power
spectrum are normalized by the maximum values at each depth. White regions in maps indicate the values with lower than
10

−2 (see color bars).

11

FIG. 3: Radial proﬁles of horizontally averaged temperature at each depth. Two cases (a) and (b) correspond to each case
shown in Figure 2 (Cases r7e0 and r7e6r, respectively).

12

FIG. 4:
(a) The three convection regimes with varying Rayleigh number (Rabot) and the viscosity contrast across the shell
(γη); the mobile-lid (circles), the sluggish-lid regime (triangles), and the stagnant-lid regimes (squares). Solid marks show
our calculations. Open marks show the results from 3-D Cartesian box and spherical shell models by Ratcliﬀ et al.
[1997].
Gray marks show the results from 3-D Cartesian box models by Trompart and Hansen [1998]. The regime boundary (dashed
curve) between convection regime and no-convection regime is referred with the reviews by Schubert et al. [2001]. Dashed line
shows the approximate boundaries that separate the three convection regimes. (b)–(d) The iso-surface renderings of residual
temperature shown in (a); (b) Rabot = 106 and γη = 104 (Case r6e4), (c) Rabot = 107 and γη = 104 (Case r7e4), and (d)
Rabot = 107 and γη = 106 (Case r7e6). Blue iso-surfaces indicate (b) δT = −0.20, (c) −0.25, and (d) −0.10. Yellow indicate
(b) δT = +0.40, (c) +0.25, and (d) +0.10. The red spheres show the bottom boundary of the mantle. (e) The temperature
distribution on a cross section for a case where Rabot = 107 and γη = 108 (Case r7e8).

13

FIG. 5: The iso-surface of residual temperature (δT ) and the power spectrum of the spherical harmonics of temperature ﬁeld
at each depth for the cases where ηL/ηref = (a) 101.5, (b) 102.0, and (c) 102.5 (Cases r7e6v1, r7e6v2, and r7e6v3, respectively).
Blue iso-surfaces indicate (b) δT = −0.20, (c) −0.25, and (d) −0.25. Yellow indicate (b) δT = +0.20, (c) +0.25, and (d) +0.25.
The logarithmic power spectrum are normalized by the maximum values at each depth. White regions in maps indicate the
values with lower than 10

−2 (see color bars).

14

FIG. 6: Radial proﬁles of the horizontally averaged temperature (left), and the horizontally averaged viscosity (right) at each
depth. Three cases (a)–(d) correspond to each case where ηL/ηref = (a) 1 (i.e., no viscosity stratiﬁcation), (b) 101.5, (c) 102.0,
and (d) 102.5 (Cases r7e6v1, r7e6v2, and r7e6v3, respectively).

15

FIG. 7: The time sequence of (a) the Nusselt number (dashed line) and the root-mean-square velocity averaged over the entire
mantle (solid line), and (b) the maximum power spectrum at each depth. The range of the spherical harmonic degrees (ℓ) is
analyzed up to ℓ = 10.

16

FIG. 8: The contour plots of the distribution of geoid anomaly for each case where ηL/ηref = (a) 1 (i.e., no viscosity
stratiﬁcation), (b) 101.5, (c) 102.0, and (d) 102.5. The results are shown by the spherical harmonic expansion up to ℓ = 24. The
spectrum are normalized by the maximum values at each degree. (e) The power spectrum of the calculated geoid anomaly for
each case (thin colored lines) and the observed geoid anomaly from the data by Konopliv et al. [1999] (thick black line). The
spectrum are normalized by the maximum values of all degrees.

17

FIG. 9: The iso-surface of residual temperature (δT ) and the power spectrum of the spherical harmonics of temperature ﬁeld
at each depth for the cases where ∆ηL = (a) 101.5, (b) 102.0, and (c) 102.5 (Cases r7e6w1, r7e6w2, and r7e6w3, respectively).
Blue iso-surfaces indicate (a) δT = −0.30, (b) −0.30, and (c) −0.20. Yellow indicate (a) δT = +0.30, (b) +0.30, and (c) +0.20.
The logarithmic power spectrum are normalized by the maximum value at each depth. White regions in maps indicate the
values with lower than 10

−2 (see color bars).

18

FIG. 10: Radial proﬁles of horizontally averaged temperature (left), and the horizontally averaged viscosity (right) at each
depth for each case where ∆ηL = (a) 1 (i.e., no viscosity stratiﬁcation), (b) 101.5, (c) 102.0, and (d) 102.5 (Cases r7e6w1,
r7e6w2, and r7e6w3, respectively).

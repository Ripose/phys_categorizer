Abstract

Criteria for the incipient motion of a rigid body initially resting on a rigid surface
are formulated from ﬁrst principles in this work. The axiom that both body and
surface are rigid allows for enormous simpliﬁcation. A modiﬁed Coulomb friction
model and an associated distribution of reaction forces are proposed. Incipient rota-
tion and incipient translation are then considered as seperate categories of motion
for the purposes of a more conventional approach. In this way a model which caters
for the majority of combined translations and rotations is devised.

Although incipient motion criteria could be thought of as the principles underlying
a diverse spectrum of problems, they are developed here in the context of a model
for sediment erosion. A sedimentation model which would largely be based on the
probability of erosion (as deﬁned empirically in terms of incipient motion criteria)
is outlined.

Keywords: incipient motion; modiﬁed Coulomb friction; sediment stability

1 Introduction

An enormous diversity of problems subscribe to the basic rigid–body–on–a–rigid–surface
theme. Criteria for incipient motion are the fundamentals which underlie a diverse spec-
trum of problems in engineering ranging from the manoeuvre and transport of large
structures of megaton proportions, through to the more ﬁckle, such as sediment erosion.
Although the topic of sedimentation may not lend itself ideally to the application of an
incipient motion analysis, it is an ideal context in which to formulate criteria for incipient
motion, it being suﬃciently general.

Classes of permissible rotations and translations are formulated for rigid bodies initially
resting on rigid surfaces, as well as modiﬁed Coulomb friction models for such incipient

rotations and translations. These are proposed as the criteria on which to base incipient
translation and rotation analyses.

There is nothing new about incipient motion analyses. In fact, a more direct application
of Newton’s ﬁrst law one probably couldn’t ﬁnd. There is also nothing new about incip-
ient motion based analyses in their application to sedimentation processes in particular,
one of its modern founders considered to be Shields (see Buffington, 1999). Shields
postulated a formula for a dimensionless threshold shear stress in terms of the grain
Reynolds number. More recent pioneers such as Yalin (1971) and Raudkivi (1967)
also based their work around threshold bed shear stresses. The former made extensive
use of dimensional methods to determine criteria of similarity. Raudkivi (1967) did
likewise, but broaches more challenging topics such as the problems of transport and bed
forms. Most of this, and subsequent, valuable work is in the empirical–experimental vein,
incipient motion itself being an empirical criterion on which to base sedimentation.

The opinion here is that the topic has not yet been exhaustively investigated, despite
the enormous wealth of experimental work already accomplished. This is not to say that
aspects of this work are not experimental to. Experiments in this work are, however, nu-
merical experiments of a computational nature. Complete continuum mechanical models
have become possible with the advent of the information age and the tendency to exper-
iment numerically with such problems is beginning to gain more widespread acceptance
and recognition than before. This work proposes to ﬁll the niche of shape and local ﬂow
complexity facilitated by recent advances in computer technology.

1.1 The Numerical Simulation–Versus–Empirical Argument

The study of non–cohesive sedimentation or loose boundary hydraulics has, to date, been
largely experimental/empirical. Empirical formulas are deduced from experimental data
and arguments of dimensionality. Such work is preoccupied with spheres and repre-
sentative diameters (the grain Reynolds number). This need not be an altogether bad
thing if one considers that one is really dealing with a representitive grain from an entire
population of sediment grains whose individual constituents are non–uniform in shape.
Incipient motion is, after all, itself an empirical criterion on which to base sedimentation.
Unlike more empirical work, this work indulges in the luxury of aﬀording sediment grains
a shape.

1.1.1 Advantages of Numerical Simulation

Numerical experiments are cheap, there are no physical limitations and they are non–
invasive, albeit that they would appear to be hazardous to mental health. The numerical
approach presented here overcomes at least two of the limitations faced by experimental-
ists of the conventional hydraulic–engineering schools of thought. Localised intergranular
ﬂow is amenable to calculation (but not measurement). Shape can also directly be taken
into account using numerical simulations (and shape is important). The degree of expo-
sure to ﬂow and the orientation within the surface remain factors which are problematic

when carrying out numerical simulations (sediments such as Kunhle’s unimodal gravel
being the possible exception).

1.1.2 Disadvantages of this Numerical Simulation

Experimentalists callibrate their empirical models by observing an entire sediment mass
as opposed to being exclusively preoccupied with a single sediment grain. As such they
may be better able to accomodate the capricious aspects of real sedimentary processes
by way of their parameters which require “tweeking”. Sedimentary processes do after all
pertain to an entire sediment as a whole. For example Kunhle (1993) observed that
unimodal sediments display equal entrainment mobility1 and this phenomenon is, in all
likelihood modal.

The absence of a ﬁner fraction might well reduce such unimodal sediments to a collection
of delicately balanced vertices and edges, alternatively a system of tightly interlocking
grains. Once disturbed this would lead to a “dominoe eﬀect” in the ﬁrst instance, while
a “chain is as strong as its weekest link” would be the operative phrase in the second.
Either scenario would give rise to the kind of simultaneous motion one often associates
with scree. The likelihood of interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow in the absence of a ﬁner fraction would
here be thought of as an aggravating factor. The presence of a ﬁner fraction would inhibit
any subsequent coarsening of the bed surface.

Whatever the exact explanation, the fact remains that one observes a diﬀerent mode
of sediment entrainment in the instance of unimodal sediments. Observations such as
Kunhle’s indicate that the phenomena associated with entraiment are not simply those
of a single grain. This has disturbing ramiﬁcations for models based on the incipient
motion of a single grain. A more ideal sediment one probably couldn’t ﬁnd than that
approximated by Kunhle’s unimodal gravel. Particle–particle interactions etc. are obvi-
ously very relevant. The existance of bed forms and a host of other such phenomena are
likewise disturbing factors. Such observations suggest that models based on the premise
of a single grain are vulnerable to accusations of what is often termed “fragmentation”
in science.

On the other hand, similar criticism can just as equally be levelled at the concept of
relating deposition to incipient motion.
Incipient motion assumes selective erosion is
as, or more, important than selective deposition in order to elucidate the problem of
sedimentation. It denies the possibility that some deposits may exist in a state of dynamic
equilibrium. Using a single grain should amount to no more of a fundamental ﬂaw
than the concept of relating deposition to incipient motion. Identifying what one might
suppose to be a “most signiﬁcant grain” might be more productive than philosophising
about the pros and cons of using a single sediment grain. Modelling the sediment as
a non–newtonian slurry, one part of a two ﬂuid problem, is otherwise seen as the only
tractable alternative.

2 Using Numerical Methods to Model Entrainment

Forces

The work presented here and in subsequent sections is inextricably linked to the theory
and model developed by the author in Childs (2000), Childs (1999) and Childs and
Reddy (1999). Most of the numerical details, particularly those pertaining to the ﬁnite
element method, are contained in the latter.

In this section it is demonstrated how the trajectory of a hypothetical pebble in transport
was able to be accurately predicted using a model derived from the most fundamental
principles.

2.1 A Rigid Body in a Fluid with Free Surface

Suppose that length is to be measured in units of X and velocity in units of V (which
is really parameterising time by T = X
V ). Using the symbol Jii(no sum) to denote the
ith, dimensionless (obtained by dividing by ρsX 5) principal moment of inertia of the
rigid body, H to denote the transition matrix for a transition to a reference whose
axes coincide with these principal moments of inertia, c to denote the centre of mass
of the rigid body, Γrb to denote the dimensionless surface of the rigid body, t to denote
a dimensionless time, ρf and ρs to denote the density of ﬂuid and solid respectively,
V 2 ¯b to denote a dimensionless
m to denote the dimensionless mass of the rigid body, X
body forces, h to denote the dimensionless elevation of a free surface (h being a function
of a reference prohibited from deforming in a lateral direction i.e. nodes belonging to
the free surface move in the vertical only), v to denote the dimensionless velocity of
the underlying ﬂuid, F to denote the deformation gradient, J its determinant, vmesh to
denote the dimensionless velocity of a reference which is otherwise allowed to deform
freely and Re to denote the Reynolds number,

Re =

,

the combined, dimensionless, free surface–ﬂuid–rigid body problem can then be stated as
follows: Find xrb, θ, vrb, ω, h and v (the dimensionless respective position, orientation,
velocity and angular velocity of the rigid body, the elevation of the free surface and the
velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid), which satisfy

at ﬁxed, solid impermeable boundaries. Additional boundary conditions depend on the
problem in question.

2.2 A Conclusive Numerical Experiment

To give some idea of the power with which numerical methods are able to calculate the
forces of entrainment, consider the results for the “pebble in a pothole” featured in Figure
1. The “Pebble” (a die bead of neutral bouyancy1) was released from rest at the centre
of the standard driven cavity ﬂow problem (see Childs (2000) or Simo and Armero
(1993) for a description of the standard driven cavity ﬂow problem) and its motion was
accurately determined. The results involve a “pebble” of elliptical shape

x2
1
22 +

x2
2
12 = 0.0252,

whose major axis is 0.1.

The results were in agreement with the notion that the die bead would move in tandem
with the ﬂuid soon after its release from rest. In the succesive trajectories in Figure 1 the
mass was successively concentrated closer to the centre (a lower moment of inertia was
used). A clockwise spin was then induced. The last trajectory in Figure 1 was obtained
using a Reynolds number of unity in order to generate a smooth, predictable ﬂow as
close as possible to established driven cavity ﬂow results. It serves to further verify the
potential of the methods described qualitatively.

The results for these tests are extremely encouraging, especially when it is considered
that the Reynolds numbers implied by small, included rigid bodies are low and the
model being developed is eventually intended to elucidate problems of a sedimentological
nature. Further cause for celebration is that both the convective acceleration and pressure
gradient have a negligeable eﬀect on the mechanical character of ﬂuid motion in the
vicinity of the bed Yalin (1971).

Of course turbulence is not taken into account in this particular model. It is, however,
encouraging to know that for a laminar ﬂow or laminar sublayer greater than ﬁve times
the surface irregularity grains will not shed eddies and drag is due to viscous shear
(Raudkivi, 1967). Furthermore such features are readily incorporated into this model
by way of modifying the viscosity according to a well established technique, the so–called
k–ǫ model.

The ﬁrst three equations on page 5 are a dimensionless form of Euler’s equations written
in terms of a ﬂow tractional force. Both they and the fourth equation have little relevance
to either selective erosion or selective deposition processes until such time as interactions
with the bottom are included. The remainder of this work is dedicated to doing exactly
that. The model on page 5 is computationally expensive and is a model for transport. It
serves to illustrate the power of the ﬁnite element and other methods to the reader well;

1Although a neutral bouyancy is not immediately reminiscent of any real life sediment problem, it

was used to give maximum meaning to the problem as a test.

in particular the accuracy with which ﬂow–tractional forces can be modelled. From this
the reader will hopefully conclude that the numerical model is more than adequate for the
purposes of incipient motion (if the techniques employed are adequate in the prediction
of transport, then they are certainly adequate for the purposes of incipient motion). Only
bed–rigid body interactions still need to be factored into this model.

3 Notation

Suppose, for simplicity, that the shape of the rigid body can be adequately described by
some equation of the form

and that the rigid surface on which this rigid body rests can be adequately described
in terms of some function b(x1, x2) which speciﬁes the vertical position of the surface in
terms of the horizontal coordinates x1 and x2. That is

(see Fig. 2 for a schematic representation of the problem of interest).

Figure 2: Γe and Γc are the respective exposed and contact surfaces of a rigid body of
shape f (x) = 0, resting on a rigid bottom of shape b(x1, x2).

The contact surface or interface between rigid body and surface, here denoted Γc, may
be formally deﬁned as

Γc = {x : f (x) = 0, x3 = b(x1, x2); x ∈ R}

in terms of this notation. The exposed surface of the rigid body, here denoted Γe, may
be formally deﬁned as

Γe = {x : f (x) = 0, x3 6= b(x1, x2); x ∈ R}

in terms of this notation. There would appear to be no obvious reason why any shape or
surface can not be described in the speciﬁed manner. One would, of course, expect f (x)
and b(x1, x2) to be necessarily complicated in real–life examples.

4 Incipient Motion

A more direct application of Newton’s ﬁrst law1 one possibly couldn’t ﬁnd than incipient
motion. In this case the nett or resultant force acting on the rigid body is best thought
of as being composed as follows

F = F ﬂow&g + F c

where F ﬂow&g is the combined gravitational and ﬂow–tractional force) acting on the rigid
body and F c is the sum of forces (a combined frictional and reaction force) acting at the
bed–rigid body contact, Γc. The practicalities of computing the former quantity were
discussed at length in Section 2. The problem is that there is no established method
to determine the distribution of the latter along the bed–rigid body contact. It is this
problem which the remainder of this work will address.

4.1 Gravitational and Flow–tractional Forces and Torques

Any incipient translation will be initiated by a combination of gravitational and ﬂow–
tractional forces,

F ﬂow&g =

σ −∇f

||∇f ||dΓe + mg,

ZΓe

(1)

modiﬁed, of course, by any induced forces of reaction and friction (σ is the Cauchy stress
at the rigid body–ﬂuid interface, Γe, and mg is the weight of the particle) .

The rotational component of incipient motion associated with this self–same combination
of gravitational and ﬂow–tractional couples is

τ ﬂow&g =

(x − c) ∧ σ −∇f

||∇f || dΓe +

ρ(x − c) ∧ g dΩ

(2)

ZΓe

ZΩrb

where c is some convenient point2 and Ωrb is the rigid body domain.

Remark: If c is chosen to be the centre of mass then the second term on the right hand
side vanishes (by the deﬁnition of a centre of mass).

The important thing to recognise here is that any incipient translation will nonetheless
be a component of the force F ﬂow&g (other components contributing to couples or being
cancelled outright) and any incipient rotation will likewise be a component of τ ﬂow&g.

4.2 Frictional and Reaction Forces: Model 1 (Uses Modiﬁed

Coulomb Friction)

One of the more original ideas of this work is a modiﬁed or extended Coulomb friction
model, a model in which classical Coulomb friction is adapted to curved surfaces. This
1A body will continue in a state of rest, or uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted on by a

nett or resultant force.

2The torque is independent of the point about which it was calculated

10

modiﬁed Coulomb friction model and the associated distribution of reaction forces have
subsequently been tested on deep drawing problems with some success.

The model is arrived at by extending the plane contact surface models to more general
surfaces. The distribution of the reaction forces along Γc is obtained by a similar abuse
of Newton’s third law1.

in which c2 is determined by requiring that a component of F ﬂow&g, normal to a part
of the contact, be completely balanced by the same component of reaction force. The
disturbing question of whether another such component will be likewise balanced, when
using the same c2 scale, then arises. This dilemma can be avoided for all but one category
of incipient motion in the next model, Model 2.

Remark: Although the modiﬁed Coulomb friction and associated distribution of reaction
force model was originally proposed for the purposes of this work, it has subsequently
been developed and investigated in the context of deep drawing problems. For such
equilibria one can, of course, solve for c2 more simply by requiring that the sum of forces
vanishes (one simply requires the frictional and reaction forces to balance the relevant
F ﬂow&g analogue). The whole point of incipient motion analyses is, however, to establish
whether such an equilibrium exists and so one has to be more imaginative.

4.3 Frictional and Reaction Forces: Model 2

There exists a surprisingly large category of “general” motions which subscribe to a
more conventional and less numerically intensive analysis than Model 1. The remaining
category can still be tested for pure translation or pure rotation (but not simulataneously,
unless one applies some or other iterative method) using the model presently expounded.
The key to this model lies in identifying so–called signiﬁcant reaction surfaces on the
contact, Γc. Incipient motions are best categorised as below for this purpose.

4.3.1 Possible Modes of Incipient Motion

1. Translation only (lifting or sliding).

2. Sliding combined with an “away from the surface” rotation.

3. Lifting combined with an “away from the surface” rotation.

4. Pivotting combined with lifting.

5. Rotation only (pivotting or an “away from the surface” rotation).

6. Pivotting combined with sliding:

(a) About the same contact.

(b) About diﬀerent contacts (less likely).

By “away from the surface” rotations is meant that the sediment partcle is rotated oﬀ
the contact surface in such a way that no frictional or reaction forces are incurred i.e.
there is no counter torque. To be precise, the minimum (8) is always > 0).

12

S.J. Childs

This condition amounts (under all but the most exceptional circumstances) to immedi-
ately excluding axes of rotation surrounded and intersected by normals from the contact
surface.

Figure 3: The Condition which Amounts to Immediately Excluding Axes of Rotation
Around which Normals to the Contact Surface can be Drawn.

The axis about which an “away from the surface” rotation occurs lies in one of the
unshaded regions – which one depends on the sign of the rotation. For a ﬂow–induced
rotation axis whih tends to lie in such a region as the shaded one might guess the point
about which the rigid body will rotate, is the nearest point to the centre of mass which
does not lie on a normal to the contact surface (based on a principle of least action).

4.4

Incipient Translation (for τ ﬂow&g = 0)

Three stages are proposed for the investigation of an incipient translation. The ﬁrst
stage is to compute the combined gravitational and ﬂow–tractional forces. Permissible
translations, as determined by a most signiﬁcant reaction surface, are then formulated in
terms of the notation depicted in Fig. 2, given that both the body and the surface on
which it rests are rigid. A category of permissible incipient translations in which frictional
forces are absent is then deﬁned. This category is then extended to include frictional
forces. The three stage strategy is described in detail in the following subsections.

4.4.1 The Signiﬁcant Reaction Surface

The force F ﬂow&g may be thought of as acting in a line everywhere since the body is
rigid.

Figure 4: The Signiﬁcant Reaction Surface to F ﬂow&g.

Assume incipient translation occurs. The signiﬁcant reaction surface, as deﬁned here, is
that part of the contact surface which determines the direction of the incipient translation.
The surface normal has a negative projection on the combined gravitational and ﬂow–
tractional forces at this location, furthermore, it is identiﬁed by the value of this projection
being a minimum (for obvious reasons). That is,

min
x∈Γc

−∇f
||∇f || · F ﬂow&g < 0.

Two scenarios whose consequences are immediately apparent spring to mind. If the above
minimum is not negative, reaction forces and friction can be disregarded; translation is a
certainty. In the event of the above minimum having a value of −F ﬂow&g, the combined
gravitational and ﬂow–tractional force is perfectly balanced by an equal and opposite
reaction. In this instance no incipient translation will occur and static equilibrium will
be preserved in the absence of any couples. Incipient motion in a direction tangent to
the signiﬁcant contact surface is otherwise possible and a certainty in the event that the
contact can be idealised as frictionless.

Remark: In the event of F ﬂow&g giving rise to a component tangent to Γc, incipient
translation will be unobstructed. The stipulated minimum would otherwise be contra-
dicted (f (x) is continuous).

4.4.2 The Resulting τ ﬂow&g = 0 Algorithm (for Incipient Translation)

The strategy for computing the force on the rigid body may therefore be summarised as
follows. Compute F ﬂow&g (equation (1)) then locate the position on Γc, for which

The resultant force which arises in the event of the above minimum being a negative
quantity, assuming the minimum is unique (for simplicity, otherwise the forces will be

equally shared), can then be calculated using the formula

where F reaction and F friction are given by equations (3) and (4) respectively. A zero value
would correspond to no incipient motion. A non–zero value indicates the frictional force
is insuﬃcient to impede translation. The resulting torque is

τ = [(x∗ − c) ∧ F reaction + (x∗ − c) ∧ F friction] H

∇f
||∇f || · F ﬂow&g

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where x∗ is the minimum prescribed by equation (5).

Remark: If c is chosen to be the point on the contact surface at which the minimum
(5) occurs then the terms vanish.

The Outcome

1. Minimum (5) > 0 ⇒ lifting.

2. Minimum (5) is −F ﬂow&g ⇒ no translation.

3. Minimum (5) < 0, F 6= 0 in equation (6) ⇒ sliding.

4. Minimum (5) < 0, F = 0 in equation (6) ⇒ no translation.

4.5

Incipient Rotation (for F ﬂow&g = 0)

An analogous three stages are proposed for the incipient rotation investigation. The ﬁrst
stage is to compute the combined gravitational and ﬂow–tractional torque. Permissible
rotations, as determined by a most signiﬁcant reaction surface, are then formulated in
terms of the notation depicted in Fig. 2, given that both the body and the surface on
which it rests are rigid. A category of permissible incipient rotations in which frictional
forces are absent is then deﬁned. This category is then extended to include frictional
forces. The three stage strategy is described in detail in the following subsections.

4.5.1 The Signiﬁcant Reaction Surface

An analogous concept of a signiﬁcant reaction surface to the one used in the translational
analysis exists.

Figure 5: The Signiﬁcant Reaction Surface to τ ﬂow&g.

The signiﬁcant reaction surface, as deﬁned here, is that part of the contact surface which
oﬀers greatest resistance to an incipient rotation and is consequently a potential fulcrum
about which the incipient rotation might occur. One can surmise that the torque τ ﬂow&g
is equivalent to a tangential force

F τ =

τ ﬂow&g ∧ (x − c)
|| x − c ||2

,

(7)

acting at x, since τ ﬂow&g = (x − c) ∧ F τ by deﬁnition. The counter–couple arising due to
a reaction at the contact surface has a negative projection on the combined gravitational
and ﬂow–tractional torque at the desired location, furthermore, it is identiﬁed by the
value of this projection being a minimum (for obvious reasons). That is,

Two scenarios whose consequences are immediately apparent spring to mind. If the above
minimum is positive then rotation is a certainty. In the event of the above minimum being
negative then it locates the position of a fulcrum.

Remark: If the respective signiﬁcant surfaces for translation and rotation aren’t the
same one is testing for either translation or rotation, not both simultaneously. If only
one signiﬁcant surface is located or in the event that, either translation is a pure lifting
action or the body is rotated “away from the surface” with no pivot (the minimum is
positive), the methods of this section will suﬃce (a large number of cases).

4.5.2 The Resulting F ﬂow&g = 0 Algorithm (for Incipient Rotation)

The strategy for computing the torque exerted on the rigid body may therefore be sum-
marised as follows. Compute τ ﬂow&g (using equation (2)) then locate the position on Γc,

The Outcome

1. Minimum (8) > 0 ⇒ “away from the surface” rotation.

2. Minimum (8) < 0 and τ 6= 0 in equation (9) ⇒ pivotting.

3. Minimum (8) < 0 and τ = 0 in equation (9) ⇒ no rotation.

4.6 Simultaneous Incipient Rotation and Translation (F ﬂow&g 6=

0, τ ﬂow&g 6= 0)

An approach synthesising elements from the F ﬂow&g 6= 0 and the τ ﬂow&g 6= 0 cases can
be devised for the investigation of a simultaneous, incipient rotation and translation,
provided the pivot and the surface ultimately resisting the translation are the same.

4.6.1 The Signiﬁcant Reaction Surface

If the position of the pivot and signiﬁcant reaction surface for sliding are one and the
same (as is often the case), reaction forces will be parallel (parallel to −∇f
||∇f ||). They can
therefore be located using either the (5) or (8) minima.

(b) minimum (5) > 0 ⇒ lifting.

2. Minimum (5) < 0, minimum (8) > 0 ⇒ sliding with an “away from the surface”

3. Minimum (5) > 0, minimum (8) > 0 ⇒ lifting with an “away from the surface”

4. Minimum (5) > 0, minimum (8) < 0 ⇒ pivotting (mode 4).

5. Minima (5) and (8) < 0, F = 0 by equation (12) and τ 6= 0 by equation (13) ⇒

rotation only (mode 5)

(a) minimum (8) < 0 ⇒ pivotting

(b) minimum (8) > 0 ⇒ “away from the surface” rotation.

6. Minima (5) and (8)< 0, F 6= 0 by equation (12) and τ 6= 0 by equation (13) ⇒

sliding and pivotting (mode 6a).

7. F = 0 by equation (12) and τ = 0 by equation (13) ⇒ no incipient motion

Note that only mode 6b is not comprehensively dealt with. One is faced with an identical
problem as was encountered when choosing c2 in Model 1 when it comes to modes of
incipient motion in which the pivot and surface of sliding diﬀer. It may still be possible
to analyse such motions by combining the forces at the diﬀerent points in some or other
suitable mix. In countless undergraduate physics problems one ﬁnds similar problems
tacitly ignored, alternatively, heuristically “swept under the carpet” eg. ladders leaning
against frictionless walls, cars with the weight equally distributed on all four tyres etc.

5 Incipient Motion and Sediment Erosion

The possibility of mobilisation (or remobilisation) is, for sedimentation, perhaps more
relevant than the transport of the rigid body by the ﬂuid. Incipient motion can be used
as a simplistic criterion on which to base deposition, consequently the hydrodynamic
characterisation of sediments and their environments of deposition. The models developed
for the ﬁnite element simulation of the motion of a rigid body in a ﬂuid with a free surface
are ideally suited and can readily be adapted for the purposes of such an analysis.

Particle–particle interactions are admitedly unaccounted for in such a simplistic model
and the unknown ﬁnal dynamic or static state of the depositional equilibrium is further
cause for concern. As previously stated, the topic of sedimentation may not lend itself
ideally to the application of an incipient motion analysis. Orientational instability further

Incipient Motion . . .

complicates matters in that one presumably have to quantify stability in terms of the
most stable orientation only. One would therefore ﬁrst need to determine this most stable
of orientations.

6 Predicting the Quantity of Sediment Deposited

It is proposed that a relationship between the amount of sediment deposited and the
path along which it was transported could be established using a hydrodynamic charac-
terisation of the environment along this path (based on the model developed here).

The amount of sediment deposited is the amount of sediment reaching that position
multiplied by the probability of a single particle remaining there. The probability of a
single grain remaining at some locality can be based empirically on the incipient motion
criteria just formulated. The probability of a single grain arriving at some locality would
be determined using the fundamental model developed in Childs and Reddy (1998)
and one would expect this to be related to the mode of transport i.e. the average length
of the trajectories or saltations etc. in that environment.

Suppose one were to deﬁne the following functions:

dep(s) ≡ the number of rigid bodies deposited at position s,
stop(s) ≡ the probability of a single particle being deposited at position s,
sed(s) ≡ sediment available at position s.

Then

dep(s) = stop(s) × sed(s).

Starting with an initial quantity of sediment sed(s) |s=0, it stands to reason that

dep(s) = stop(s) ×

sed(s) |s=0 −

dep(ξ)dξ

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

s

where s is the distance along this route. Using the fundamental theorem of integral
calculus, alternatively Leibnitz’s rule for diﬀerentiation under the integral sign,

d
ds (

dep(s)
stop(s) )

= −dep(s).

The quotient rule allows for manipulation to

d

− dep(s)

+ dep(s) = 0,

(14)

which is in turn more conveniently expressed as

d
ds (

ln

dep(s)
stop(s) !)

 

= −stop(s).

Equation (14) is immediately recogniseable as a ﬁrst order, linear, ordinary diﬀerential
equation.

20

S.J. Childs

Example: Consider the uniform transport of sediment over a uniform bed. The function
stop(s) would be equal to some constant k under such circumstances. Therefore

d
ds

{dep(s)} + kdep(s) = 0.

A solution to this equation has the following form:

dep(s) = [dep(s) |s=0] e−ks

(15)

where dep(s) |s=0 was the amount of sediment initially deposited when transport com-
menced. This is, intuitively, a rather agreeable result.

Characterising Deposition Environments Based on Deposition

Knowing the distribution of sediment deposited along uniform parts of some route of
transport (eg. a river) one could, conversely, characterise parts of the environment i.e.
solve for k in equation (15).

7 Conclusions

Classes of permissible incipient rotations and translations can be readily and system-
atically formulated for rigid bodies placed on rigid surfaces, as are modiﬁed Coulomb
friction models for such incipient rotations and translations. These classes of permissible
incipient motion together with the friction models are proposed as criteria on which to
base incipient translation and rotation.

The possibility of mobilisation (or remobilisation) is, for sediments, perhaps more relevant
than the transport of the rigid body by the ﬂuid. Particle–particle interactions are
admitedly unaccounted for in such a simplistic model and the unknown ﬁnal dynamic or
static state of the depositional equilibrium is further cause for concern.

The relationship between the amount of sediment deposited and the path along which
it was transported could be established using a hydrodynamic characterisation of the
environment along this path.

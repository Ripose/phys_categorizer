Abstract.

Using the international ground-based network of two-frequency receivers of the

GPS navigation system provides a means of carrying out a global, continuous and

fully-computerized monitoring of phase ﬂuctuations of signals from satellite-borne

radio engineering systems caused by the Earth’s inhomogeneous and nonstationary

ionosphere. We found that during major geomagnetic storms, the errors of

determination of the range, frequency Doppler shift and angles of arrival of

transionospheric radio signals exceeds the one for magnetically quiet days by

one order of magnitude as a minimum. This can be the cause of performance

degradation of current satellite radio engineering navigation, communication and

radar systems as well as of superlong-baseline radio interferometry systems.

1. Introduction

Radio engineering satellite systems (RESS), with their ground-based and

space-borne support facilities, are ﬁnding ever-widening application in various

spheres of human activity. They are able to provide global coverage, accuracy,

continuity, high reliability and meet a number of other requirements imposed

when tackling a broad spectrum of engineering problems. However, the use

of RESS also implies new (and, in some cases, more stringent) requirements

dictated by the need to ensure safety and economical eﬃciency of the operation

of ground-based and airborne facilities, as well as to solve special problems

(observation, aerophotography, searching and rescue of distressed transport vehicles

and people). This applies equally for performance of Global Navigation Satellite

Systems (GNSS) as well as for very-long-baseline radio interferometers (VLBI)

[Thompson, R. et al., 1986].

Such requirements cannot be met unless the inﬂuence of destabilizing factors

in the radio wave propagation channel is taken into account. As electromagnetic

waves propagate through the ionosphere, they experience quite varied disturbances

[Davies, 1969; Kolosov et al., 1969; Yakovlev, 1985; Goodman and Aarons, 1990;

Yakubov, 1997].

The key characteristic of the ionosphere that determines the variation of radio

wave parameters is the integral (total) electron content (TEC) I(t) or its derivatives

(with respect to time and space) I

t, I

x and I

y along the propagation path.

TEC variations may be arbitrarily classiﬁed as regular and irregular. Regular

changes (seasonal, diurnal) - for the magnetically quiet mid-latitude ionosphere at

least - are described by models providing relative accuracy of TEC prediction in

the range 50...80%. Irregular changes (variations) are associated with ionospheric

irregularities of a diﬀerent nature, the spectrum of which has a power law character

[Gajlit, 1983; Gershman et al., 1984; Yakubov, 1997].

TEC variations introduce proportionate changes of the signal phase

ϕ(t, x, y) = k1I(t, x, y), which gives rise to measuring errors of the range

σD = k2dI, the frequency Doppler shift of the signal σf = k3I

t, and the angles

′

of arrival of the radio wave σαx = k4I

x and σαy = k4I

y, because the last

four quantities are proportional to the time and space derivatives of the phase.

Furthermore, the maximum value of the measuring error of angular deviations can
(I ′

be deduced using the relation σα = k4

x)2 + (I ′

y)2.

q

The coeﬃcients k1 −

k4 are inversely proportional to the signal frequency fc or

to its square [Davies, 1969; Kravtsov et al., 1983; Goodman and Aarons, 1990]. A

calculation uses a Cartesian topocentric coordinate system with the axis x pointing

eastward E, and the axis y pointing northward N.

Investigations of phase ﬂuctuations of transionospheric signals have been and

are carried out using radio beacons on satellites with circular and geostationary

orbits [Komrakov and Skrebkova, 1980; Livingston et al., 1981; Gajlit, 1983]. The

trouble with these measurements is that temporal and spatial resolution is low, and

continuity and global coverage of observations are unavailable.

The use of the international ground-based network of two-frequency receivers

of the navigation GPS system that at the beginning of 2002 consisted of no less

than 1000 sites and is posting its data on the Internet, opens up new avenues for a

global, continuous, fully computerized monitoring of phase ﬂuctuations of signals

and associated errors of RESS performance.

Some research results on the prediction and estimation of radio signal

ﬂuctuations and errors of RESS performance caused by them were reported in

earlier work [Afraimovich and Karachenschev, 2002].

Results of experimental investigations of phase ﬂuctuations of RESS signals

that are discussed in this paper were derived from analyzing the data for a set

consisting of 100 to 300 GPS stations covering the time interval 1998-2001, for

diﬀerent conditions of geomagnetic activity (the Dst-index from -13 to -377 nT ).

The number of passes of GPS satellites with a duration of no less than 2.5 hours,

the data from which were used in the analysis, totaled no less than 300000, or

several orders of magnitude in excess of the currently available statistic of such

measurements.

Below we give an outline of the techniques used in this study and illustrate

their application in the analysis of ionospheric eﬀects. The overall sample statistic

of errors σD, σf and σα is presented for diﬀerent geomagnetic conditions. To ease

5

comparison with other research results reported in [Gajlit, 1983; Kravtsov et al.,

1983], the errors σD, σf and σα are calculated for the working frequency of 300

MHz.

2. General information about the database used

This study relies on the data from the global network of receiving GPS stations

available on the Internet (Fig. 1). As is evident from Fig. 1, the receiving sites are

relatively dense on the territory of North America and Europe, and less as dense in

Asia. Fewer stations are located on the Paciﬁc and Atlantic.

Such coverage of the terrestrial surface by GPS receivers makes it possible,

already at the present time, to address the problem of a global investigation

of ionospheric disturbances and their consequences with a very large spatial

accumulation.

Thus, in the Western hemisphere the corresponding number of stations is

as large as 500, and the number of line-of-sight (LOS) to the satellite is at least

2000...3000. This provides a number of statistically independent series at least two

orders of magnitude higher than would be realized by recording VHF radio signals

from ﬁrst-generation geostationary satellites or low-orbit navigation satellites -

TRANSIT [Gershman et al., 1984].

Our analysis used the North-American sector with a large number of GPS
station – range of longitudes -120◦ ... -60◦ E and of latitudes 20◦ ... 70◦ N. Table 1

presents information about number of the days, the number n of GPS arrays

composed of three stations, the data from which are used, and extreme values of

Dstmin. Total number of spectra Σ also is resulted which were used for deﬁnition of

average sizes of inclinations.

For a variety of reasons, for the various events to be analyzed, we

selected somewhat diﬀering sets of receiving stations, yet the geometry of

the experiment was virtually identical for all events. The coordinates of the

receiving stations used in the experiment were available at the electronic address:

ftp://lox.ucsd.edu/pub.processing/gamit/setup/coords.txt.

3. Analysis of the measuring errors of the range, Doppler

frequency and angles of arrival of the radio wave caused

by changes in the regular ionosphere

Recently a number of authors [Wilson et al., 1995; Mannucci et al., 1998;

Schaer et al., 1998; and others] have developed a new technology for constructing

Global Ionospheric Maps (GIM) of TEC using IONEX data from the international

IGS-GPS network. The GIM technology and its uses have been reported in a large

number of publications [Wilson et al., 1995; Mannucci et al., 1998].

The standard IONEX format is described in detail in [Schaer et al., 1998].

Therefore, we will not give a detailed description of the GIM technology for

reasons of space but limit ourselves only to the information required for the

presentation of our method. Two-hour TEC maps are easily accessible to

any user, which are calculated by several research groups in the USA and

Europe and are availabe on the Internet in the standard IONEX format

(ftp://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/gps/products/ionex). It is also possible to obtain

15-min maps if necessary.

Fig. 2 is a schematic representation of a single elementary GIM cell. The cell
nodes are designated as a, b, c, d. The cell size (5◦ in longitude and 2.5◦ in latitude)

is determined by the IONEX ﬁle standard. For simplifying the transformations to
an approximation suﬃcient for our problem for latitudes not exceeding 60◦, the cell

can be represented as a rectangle with the sides de and dn. It is easy to overcome

this limitation by complicating to a certain extent the transformations allowing for

the sphericity; however, we do not present them in this report.

The linear size of the rectangular cell in latitude is independent of the latitude

and is de = 279 km; the linear size in longitude depends on the latitude, and for
40◦N it is dn = 436 km.

For each time t, for the nodes a, b, c, d from the IONEX ﬁle the values of

vertical TEC are known - Ia, Ib, Ic, Id.

The determination of the range D by the phase method is based on measuring

the phase diﬀerence ϕ between the received signal and the reference signal formed

in the receiver. Such a measurement can be made at the intermediate or carrier

7

(1)

(2)

frequency of the signal. In this case:

where c is the propagation velocity of radio waves in a free space.

Generally the quantity ϕ for the transionospheric propagation may be regarded

as the sum of two components [Afraimovich et al., 1998]:

D = c

ϕ
2 π fc

×

ϕ = ϕs+∆ϕ

where ϕs is the main component associated with a change of the distance

between the signal source and the receiver.

Analysis of the measuring errors of the range, Doppler frequency and angles of

arrival of the radio wave caused by changes in the regular ionosphere investigations

of global phase variations of radio signals and their inﬂuence on the operation of

RESS ought to take into account the proportionate relationship between phase

(phase derivative) changes of the transionospheric signal and corresponding TEC

variations [Kravtsov et al., 1983; Goodman and Aarons, 1990]:

∆ϕ = 8.44

10−7

Ia(b,c,d)
fc

+ ϕ0

×
where fc is the radio wave frequency (Hz); Ia(b,c,d) is the TEC measured at the
points a, b, c, and d (1016 el/m2); and ϕ0 is the initial phase [Spoelstra and Kelder,

×

(3)

1984].

By way of example we now analyze the errors of measurement of the range

σD, the frequency Doppler shift σf and the angle of arrival of the radio wave σα

using the IONEX data and the method that was developed at the ISTP SB RAS

[Afraimovich and Karachenschev, 2002].

The change of the range that is introduced by the ionosphere (ionospheric

error) is proportional to ∆ϕ:

σD = c

∆ϕ
2 π fc

×

(4)

Upon substituting (3) into (4), we can obtain the expression for determining

the measuring error of the range σD introduced by the ionosphere:

As is seen from (5), the error σD is directly proportional to the TEC variation

dI and inversely proportional to the carrier frequency squared.

Using the values of the spatial derivatives of TEC I

x and I ′
t makes it possible to uniquely obtain - for

y and of the

and Aarons, 1990]:

In the simplest case, the values of the derivatives for the selected cell of the

map can be obtained using TEC increments for the four cell nodes and for two

times t1 and t2 = t1 + dt:

dI = (Ia2 −

Where necessary, the spatial derivatives can be estimated by taking into

account the TEC values in adjacent nodes of the map, and the time derivative

(with a time resolution of IONEX maps no worse than 15 min) can be inferred by

averaging increments for several successive time counts.

The procedures (5), (6) and (7) are performed for all cells of the selected

spatial range and for the selected time interval of the day. One variant of data

representation implies a full exploitation of the IONEX format with the diﬀerence

that, rather than the values of TEC and the error of TEC determination [Schaer et

al., 1998], are entered into the corresponding cells of the map values of error σD,

σf and σα.

9

By way of example, it is appropriate to give the results derived from analyzing

the regular part of the spatial-temporal TEC variations for a relatively magnetically

quiet day of July 29, 1999 (with the largest deviation of the Dst-index of -40 nT )

and for the magnetically disturbed day of April 6, 2000 (with the largest deviation

of the Dst-index of -293 nT ).

Fig. 3 a, b, c portrays the maps of the errors σD, σf and σα obtained on the

basis of ﬁles in the IONEX format for the magnetically quiet day of July 29, 1999
in the geographic coordinate system in the range of longitudes -120◦ ... -60◦ E and
latitudes 20◦ ... 70◦ N. Fig. 3 d, e, f , respectively, characterizes the values of σD,

σf and σα for the magnetically disturbed day of April 6, 2000. The ﬁgure also

shows the time interval 19-21 UT, for which the analysis was carried out. Contours

show the values of errors of phase measurements in units, respectively, of σD -

”m” (meters), σf - ”Hz” (Hertz), and σα - ”arcmin” (minutes of arc). The vertical

calibrated scale shows the maximum and minimum values of the corresponding

errors.

The above maps are a pictorial rendition of the behavior dynamics of the

errors σD, σf and σα in the spatial and temporal ranges selected. Noteworthy is a

considerable diﬀerence of the maps for the magnetically quiet and disturbed days.

As is evident from Fig. 3, gradients of spatial distribution of the errors during

disturbances increase more than an order of magnitude when compared to the quiet

period, which would lead to a degradation of RESS performance.

4. Analysis of the irregular errors σD, σf and σα

Our analysis of the irregular component of the errors was based on using raw

data in the form of series of TEC values for selected receiving sites as well as values

of elevations Θs(t) and azimuths αs(t) to visible satellites that were calculated using

a specially developed program, CONVTEC, to convert RINEX-ﬁles (standard ﬁles

for the GPS system) available from the Internet [Afraimovich et al., 1998].

Fig. 4 presents the geometry of transionospheric radio sounding. The axes

z, y, x are pointing, respectively, to the zenith, the north N, and to the east E;

P is the point of intersection of the LOS to the satellite (the line connecting the

10

satellite to the radio signal receiver) with the ionospheric F2 region peak; S is the

subionospheric point (projection of the point P onto the terrestrial surface).

The GPS technology provides the means of estimating TEC variations on the

basis of phase measurements of TEC I in each of the spaced two-frequency GPS

receivers using the formula [Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 1992]:

I0 =

1
40.308

1 f 2
f 2
2
f 2
2

f 2
1 −

[(L1λ1 −

L2λ2) + const + nL],

(9)

where L1λ1 and L2λ2 are phase path increments of the radio signal, caused

by the phase delay in the ionosphere (m); L1 and L2 are the number of full phase

rotations, and λ1 and λ2 are the wavelengths (m) for the frequencies f1 and f2,

respectively; const is some unknown initial phase path (m); and nL is the error

in determination of the phase path (m).

Series of the values of elevations Θs(t) and azimuths αs(t) of the beam to the

satellite were used to determine the coordinates of subionospheric points, and to

convert the ”oblique” TEC I0(t) to the corresponding value of the ”vertical” TEC

I(t) by employing the technique reported by [Klobuchar, 1986]:

I = I0 ×

cos

Rz + hmax

cosΘs(cid:19)(cid:21)

,

(10)

where Rz is the Earth’s radius, and hmax=300 km is the height of the F2-layer

maximum.

All results in this study were obtained for elevations Θs(t) larger than 30◦.

To analyze the errors σD, σf and σα that are cased by the irregular component

of TEC variation, we make use of the relations for the respective regular errors (5),

(6) and (7). The diﬀerence in the analysis of irregular errors implies a diﬀerent

(compared with the IONEX technique) method of determining the values of TEC

and its derivatives [Afraimovich and Karachenschev, 2002].

The phase diﬀerences ∆ϕx,y along the axes x and y are proportional to the

values of the horizontal components of TEC gradient GE = I

where xA, yA, xC, yC are the coordinates of the sites A and C in the topocentric

coordinate system. When deriving (11) we took into account that xB = yB = 0,

since site B is the center of topocentric coordinate system.

The time derivative of TEC I ′

t is determined by diﬀerentiating I(t) at the

point B.

The procedures of (5), (6) and (7) are performed for all groups of three GPS

stations of the selected spatial range and for satellites visible from these stations,

as well as for the selected time interval of the day.

Fig. 5 presents the results derived from analyzing the irregular component of

the errors σD, σf and σα in the form of ﬂuctuation spectra of the range, Doppler

frequency and angles of arrival of radio waves.

With the purpose of improving the statistical reliability of the data, we used the

spatial averaging technique for spectra within the framework of a novel technology

[Afraimovich et al., 2001]. The method implies using an appropriate processing of

TEC variations that are determined from the GPS data, simultaneously for the

entire set of GPS satellites (as many as 5–10 satellites) ”visible” during a given

time interval, at all stations of the global GPS network used in the analysis.

Individual spectra of the errors σD, σf and σα were obtained by processing

continuous series of I(t) measurements of a duration no shorter than 2.5 hours.

To eliminate errors caused by the regular ionosphere, as well as trends introduced

the motion of satellites, we used the procedure of removing the linear trend by

preliminarily smoothing the initial series with the selected time window of a

duration of about 60 min.

Fig. 5 shows the overall character of the TEC variations dI(t) that were ﬁltered

from TEC series obtained from measurements of the phase diﬀerence between two

coherently coupled signals from the GPS system [Hofmann-Wellenhof, 1992] for the

magnetically quiet day of July 29, 1999 (panel a, at the left) and a major magnetic

storm of July 15, 2000 (panel e, at the right). Furthermore, the panels show the

station names and locations, as well as GPS satellite numbers (PRN).

12

(12)

As is evident from the ﬁgure, the intensity dI(t) during the disturbance even

at such low latitudes is increased an order of magnitude as a minimum. This is

reﬂected on logarithmic amplitude spectra lgS(F ) of TEC ﬂuctuations and their

derivatives (left-hand scale in the ﬁgures) and of the ﬂuctuations of σD, σf and

σα, converted to the working frequency of 300 MHz (right-hand scale) which are

represented on a logarithmic scale (panels b, c, d, f , g, h).

The logarithmic amplitude spectrum lgS(F ) obtained by using a standard

FFT procedure. Incoherent summation of the partial mplitude spectra lgS(F )i of

diﬀerent LOS was performed by the formula:




n

Pi=1

S(F )i

n







where i is the number of LOS; i = 1, 2, ... n.

As a consequence of the statistical independence of partial spectra, the

signal/noise ratio, when the average spectrum is calculated, increases due to

incoherent accumulation at least by a factor of √n, where n is the number of LOS.

Fluctuation spectra from the magnetically quiet day of July 29, 1999 are

shown by the thin line in panels f , g, h (Fig. 5) for comparison with the spectra

from the disturbed day. The range of ﬂuctuation periods is shown in bold type

along the abscissa axis in panels d and h. Panels b and f show also the number n of

GPS arrays composed of three stations, the data from which are used to estimate

the spatial derivatives of TEC [Afraimovich et al., 2001].

Spectra of phase ﬂuctuations have a power law character with the values of

the slopes ν, shown in panels b, c, d, f , g, h. The slope of spectrum is determined

by the slope of the ﬁtted straight line (thin black line in panel b of Fig. 5). These

results are in reasonably good agreement with data reported in [Komrakov and

Skrebkova, 1980; Livingston et al., 1981; Gajlit et al., 1983; Kravtsov et al., 1983;

Gershman et al., 1984; Yakubov, 1997].

13

5. Distribution of slopes and scales of spectra of the errors

In the preceding section we obtained the ﬂuctuation spectra of the errors σD,

σf and σα corresponding to diﬀerent ionospheric conditions. It was shown that

the spectra have a power law character, with deﬁnite indices of the slope ν (Fig. 5).

However, the individual spectra that were obtained do not give a full insight into

the global picture of ﬂuctuations of the errors. To obtain a generalized estimate

we carried out an analysis of the spectra of errors obtained by processing the data

covering more than 30 days (over 600 spectra).

In our experiment the range of ﬂuctuation periods of spectra varies from 2 min

to 2 hours. Experimental spectra of the errors σD, σf and σα have a complicated

form (Fig. 5). There are spectral density maxima and minima. Generally, however,

the spectral density S(F ) decreases with the increasing ﬂuctuation frequency. For

each individual spectrum, calculated on a logarithmic scale, we determined the

ﬁtted straight line.

The result of a generalized estimation is represented by the plots in Fig. 6.

The plots show the distributions of the slopes PσD(ν), Pσf (ν), Pσα(ν) of power law

spectra of the errors σD, σf and σα, respectively. The interval ∆ν of the slopes

of the spectra σD is ∆σD =

1.45...2.45, with the mean value of <∆σD >=

1.95.

In view of the relationship between the spectrum σD

0.40...1.60, <∆σf >=

Main results of this study are as follows:

1. In this paper we have suggested a new technique for estimating the errors of

RESS performance, based on using phase measurements from two-frequency

receivers of the satellite navigation GPS system.

2. Fluctuation spectra of the errors are generally quite well approximated by

the power function. Mean values of the slopes of spectra, obtained from the

experiment, are in good agreement with data reported by other authors.

3. The errors σD, σf and σα are conveniently estimates with a suﬃcient

accuracy for practical purposes by using mean statistical data for indices of

slopes of spectra ν and scale coeﬃcients b.

4. Our results can be equally assigned to the estimation of the Russian GNSS –

GLONASS performance quality.

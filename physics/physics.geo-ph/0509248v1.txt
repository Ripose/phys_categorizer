We study, by using a wavelet decomposition methodology, the solar sig-

nature on global surface temperature data using the ACRIM total solar

irradiance satellite composite by Willson and Mordvinov. These data present a

+0.047%/decade trend between minima during solar cycles 21-23 (1980-2002).

We estimate that the ACRIM upward trend might have contributed

10-30%

∼

of the global surface temperature warming over the period 1980-2002.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Among the potential contributors to climate change, solar forcing is by far the most con-

troversial. The Sun can inﬂuence climate through mechanisms that are not fully understood

but which can be linked to solar variations of luminosity, magnetic ﬁeld, UV radiation, solar

ﬂares and modulation of the cosmic ray intensity [Pap and Fox, 2004; Lean, 2005]. In addi-

tion, there is also controversy about solar data. Figure 1 shows two similar but not identical

satellite composites of total solar irradiance (TSI) that cover solar cycles 21-23 (1980-2002):

the PMOD due to Fr¨ohlich and Lean [1998] and the ACRIM due to Willson and Mordvinov

[2003], respectively.

PMOD has been widely used in geophysical research. According to this composite, TSI

has been almost stationary (-0.009%/decade trend of the 21-23 solar minima [Willson and

Mordinov, 2003]) and by adopting it, or the equivalent TSI proxy reconstruction by Lean

et al. [1995], some researchers and the IPCC [Houghton et al. (2001); Hansen et al. 2002]

deduced that the Sun has not contributed to the observed global surface warming of the past

decades. Consequently, the global surface warming of ∆T1980−2002 = 0.40

0.04 K from 1980

±

to 2002 shown in Figure 2 could only be induced, directly or indirectly, by anthropogenic

added green house gas (GHG) climate forcing.

Contrariwise, ACRIM presents a signiﬁcant upward trend (+0.047%/decade trend of the

minima) during solar cycles 21-23 (1980-2002) [Willson and Mordvinov, 2003]. The purpose

of this letter is to estimate the contribution of this upward trend to the global surface

warming from 1980 to 2002, which covers one Hale solar cycle.

II. CLIMATE MODELS AND DATA ANALYSIS

average during solar cycle 21-22 (1980-1991) (1365.95

The ACRIM upward trend is evaluated by calculating the diﬀerence between the TSI
0.08 W/m2) and the TSI average
0.03 W/m2). We ﬁnd this diﬀerence to be

during solar cycle 22-23 (1991-2002) (1366.40

±

∆Isun = 0.45

0.10 W/m2 .

(1)

The errors bars are calculated using multiple TSI averages by considering that the period

of a solar cycle spans between 10 and 12 years and by keeping ﬁxed the extremum at 1991.

Note also that the upward ACRIM modulation during solar cycles 21-23 can be minimally

interpreted as a 22-year square waveform modulation, which recalls a Hale solar cycle, with

amplitude ∆Isun.

There exist at least two ways to estimate the Sun’s inﬂuence on climate. The ﬁrst method

relies on climate models, such as energy balance models [Wigley, 1988; Stevens and North,

1996; Foukal et al., 2004] or general circulation models [Houghton J.T., et al. (2001); Hansen

et al. 2002]. The climate model approach is problematic because the sun-climate coupling

mechanisms are not fully understood and, therefore, cannot be conﬁdently included in the

computational models [Hoyt and Schatten, 1997; Hansen et al., 2002; Pap and Fox, 2004].

A second approach, adopted, for example, by Douglass and Clader [2002], attempts

to estimate the climate sensitivity to solar variation by directly studying the signature of

the solar cycles within the temperature data. This is a phenomenological approach but

it has the advantage of evaluating the total eﬀect of the Sun-Climate coupling without

requiring a detailed knowledge of the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms. Herein

we adopt this philosophy using a methodology that diﬀers from the linear regression analysis

implemented by Douglass and Clader [2002], for reasons explained later.

The climate sensitivity λ to a generic radiative forcing ∆F is deﬁned as ∆T = λ∆F , where

∆T is the average temperature change induced by ∆F . The radiative forcing associated

with a change of TSI, ∆I, is traditionally obtained by averaging ∆I over the entire surface

of the Earth and allowing for a fraction (albedo a
∆Fsun = 1−a

≈

4 ∆I. However, the above deﬁnition is not optimal if, as is commonly believed,

0.3) of ∆I to be reﬂected away:

the Sun aﬀects climate by means of direct or indirect mechanisms over and above that of

the direct TSI forcing. Because solar phenomena present cycles and general patterns that

mimic TSI patterns, we hypothesize that, to a ﬁrst-order approximation, TSI can be used as

a geometrical proxy for the overall solar activity and its eﬀects on climate. Moreover, there

might be a dependence of this response on frequency [Wigley, 1988]. Thus, we introduce the

following model for the total climate sensitivity to the total solar activity:

∆Tsun =

Z(ω)

dω .

∞

(2)

The frequency-dependent function Z(ω) is herein deﬁned as the total climate sensitivity

to solar variations. Note that Douglass and Clader [2002] adopted a model in which the

function Z(ω) is a constant k at all frequencies such that: ∆Tsun = k ∆I.

Douglass and Clader [2002] evaluated the climate sensitivity to solar variation, k =
0.02 K/(W m−2), by using the PMOD TSI composite and by means of a multiple

linear regression analysis based on a predictor for the temperature T (t) of the form C(t) =

f (t) + k1I(t

τ3) is a measure of the volcano-aerosol signal,

−
τi are ﬁxed lag-times that give the highest correlation between each signal and the data,

and the ki are the corresponding forcing constants. However, the multiple linear regression

analysis is not optimal because the parameters ki and τi might be time-dependent and, in

such a case, keeping them constant would yield serious systematic errors in the evaluation of

the parameters ki. Moreover, climate models predict that the climate sensitivity to cyclical

forcing increases at lower frequencies because of the strong frequency-dependent damping

eﬀect of ocean thermal inertia [Wigley, 1988; Foukal et al., 2004]. Thus, Douglass and

Clader [2002] evaluated the climate sensitivity to the 11-year solar cycle, but as we have

discussed above, the upward ACRIM modulation during solar cycles 21-23 can be minimally

interpreted as a 22-year cycle modulation with amplitude given by Eq. (1). Therefore, we

3

have to evaluate the climate sensitivity to a 22-year cycle and then we can approximate Eq.

(2) as

∆Tsun ' Z22years ∆Isun .

(3)

We proceed by decomposing the solar and temperature signals with proper band-pass

ﬁlters for isolating the frequency bands of interest. The purpose is to estimate a linear

transfer coeﬃcient Z(ω) = Aout(ω)/Ain(ω) by comparing the amplitude Ain(ω) of an os-

cillating input signal at a given frequency ω, with the amplitude Aout(ω) of the oscillating

output signal at the same frequency and then to apply Eq. (3). Linear transfer analysis is

the usual method adopted to estimate the sensitivity of a complex but unknown system to

external stimulation.

The band pass ﬁlter we adopt is based on the maximal overlap discrete wavelet trans-

form (MODWT) multiresolution analysis (MRA) by means of the 8-tap Daubechies least

asymmetric (LA8) ﬁlter [Percival and Walden, 2000]. MRA makes use of scaled waveforms

that measure signal variations by simultaneously analyzing the signal’s time and scaling

properties and, therefore, can powerfully identify local non-periodic patterns and signal sin-

gularities, and characterize signal structures [Percival and Walden, 2000]. Thus, the wavelet

ﬁltering is more eﬃcient than the traditional linear transport frequency ﬁlters for extracting

patterns in the data.

MODWT MRA decomposes a time series X(t) into a hierarchical sequence of zero-

centered band-pass ﬁlter curves called detail curves Dj(t), and a hierarchical sequence of

smooth low-pass ﬁlter curves, called Sj(t). High-pass ﬁlter curves are referred to as residual
curves and indicated with Rj(t). The index j indicates the order of scaling. So, at the J th or-

der MODWT MRA decomposes a signal X(t) as X(t) = SJ (t)+

J
j=1 Dj(t) = SJ (t)+RJ (t).
The smooth curve SJ (t) captures the smooth modulation of the data with a time scale larger
than 2J+1 units of the time interval ∆t at which the data are sampled. The detail curve
Dj(t) captures local variations with period approximately ranging from 2j∆t to 2j+1∆t.

Finally, the residual curve RJ (t) = X(t)

The global surface temperature data are sampled monthly. The 11-year cycle (132

months) would be captured by the wavelet detail D7(t) that corresponds to the band between
27 = 128 and 28 = 256 months. However, the solar cycles are pseudo-periodic and to avoid

an excessive random split of the cycles between adjacent wavelet detail curves, the wavelet

4

ﬁlter should be optimized by choosing a time interval ∆t such that the 11-year periodicity

falls in the middle of the band captured by the curve D7(t). The average between 128 and

256 is 192, and the correct time interval is ∆t = 132/192 = 0.6875 months. By using a linear

interpolation we transform the monthly temperature data into a new time series sampled at

∆t = 0.6875 months, and then apply the MRA to it. Thus, the detail curve D7(t) captures

the scaling band between 88-176 months (or 7.3-14.7 years) centered in the 11-year solar

cycle, while the detail curve D8(t) captures the band between 176-352 months (or 14.7-29.3

years) centered in the 22-year solar cycle. Figure 3 shows the MODWT MRA of the global

mean surface temperature since 1856 deﬁned by the decomposition

T (t) = S8(t) + D8(t) + D7(t) + R6(t) .

(4)

The smooth curve S8(t) captures the secular variation of the temperature at time scale

larger than 29.3 years that is reasonably produced by the slow modulation of the GHG

and aerosol forcings plus the slow secular variation of the solar forcing. The detail curves

D8(t) and D7(t) correspond, according to our hypothesis, to the climate signature imprinted

by the 22-year and 11-year solar cycles respectively. The residual curve R6(t) collects all

climate ﬂuctuations at a time scale shorter than 7.3 years, which is mostly aﬀected by SST

oscillations, volcano eruptions and undetermined noise.

Figure 4 compares the band-pass curves D7(t) and D8(t) for the TSI data and global

temperature anomalies. For the period 1856-1980 we apply the MRA to the TSI proxy

reconstruction by Lean et al. [1995], while for the period 1980-2002 the MRA is applied to

the ACRIM TSI. Several 11-year solar cycles are easily recognizable in the corresponding

D7(t) temperature cycles in particular after 1960. The slow 22-year solar cycles seem even

better reproduced in the temperature detail curve D8(t) and the temperature response lags

the Hale solar cycles since 1900 by approximately 2.2

2 years.

We evaluate the linear transfer coeﬃcient Z7 and Z8 by estimating the amplitude of the

solar and temperature oscillations associated with the band-pass curves D7(t) and D8(t)

III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Our methodology ﬁltered oﬀ volcano-aerosol and ENSO-SST signals from the tempera-

ture data because these estimates are partially consistent with already published independent
0.02 K/(W m−2) is

empirical ﬁndings. In fact, the 11-year climate sensitivity Z7 = 0.11

±

equal to the 11-year climate sensitivity k estimated by Douglass and Clader [2002]. Douglass

and Clader also estimated that the 11-year solar cycle is associated with a 0.10 K temper-

ature cycle and this value is equal to our estimate A7,temp, see also Lean [2005]. Because

Douglass and Clader used a multiple linear regression analysis to separate the 11-year solar

signature from the volcano-aerosol and ENSO-SST signals we can conclude that our wavelet

band-pass ﬁlter has eﬃciently ﬁltered oﬀ from the temperature data both volcano-aerosol

and ENSO-SST signals. Evidently, from 1980 to 2002 volcano-aerosol and ENSO-SST sig-

nals aﬀected climate on time scales shorter than 7.3 years which are captured by the residual

curve R6(t).

Our climate sensitivities Z7 and Z8 were also approximately anticipated by White et

al.

[1997]. These authors, by adopting Fourier band-pass ﬁlters centered at 11 and 22

year periodicities respectively, studied the response of global upper ocean temperature

to changing solar irradiance using the TSI proxy reconstruction by Lean et al.

[1995]

from 1900 to 1991. Their regression coeﬃcients between solar and temperature cycles are
0.02 K/(W m−2). These estimates

0.02 K/(W m−2) and k22−years = 0.14

k11−years = 0.10

±

are slightly smaller than Z7 and Z8, respectively, probably because these authors analyzed

a diﬀerent temporal period, and adopted a hypothetical TSI sequence and ocean surface

temperature while we used global surface temperature, and over land the climate response

to solar variation is stronger than over ocean.

The climate sensitivity to the 22-year cycle, Z8, is approximately 1.5 times stronger

6

than the climate sensitivity to the 11-year cycle, Z7, and, in average, the 22-year climate

response lags Hale solar cycles by approximately 2.2

predicted by theoretical energy balance models.

2 years. Both eﬀects are approximately

±
In fact, the actual climate response to

cyclical forcing is stronger at lower frequencies because the damping eﬀect of the ocean

inertia is weaker at lower frequencies [Wigley 1988, table 1]. This frequency dependence

arises because the system is typically not in thermodynamic equilibrium. The ratio Z8/Z7 =

1.55

±
η20/η10

≈

0.55 is consistent with that between the damping factors for 20 and 10 year periodicities

1.45 indicated by the Wigley’s model [1988, table 1]. Wigley’s model also predicts

a response-lag of 2.5-2.8 years for a 20 year periodicity.

In conclusion, we believe our estimates Z7 and Z8 of the climate sensitivity to solar

variations from 1980 to 2002 are realistic. By using the ACRIM TSI increase estimate

∆Isun (1), the climate sensitivity Z8 in Eq. (6) and Eq. (3), the warming caused by ∆Isun is

∆Tsun ' 0.08

0.03. Thus, because the global surface warming during the period 1980-2002

was ∆T1980−2002 = 0.40

0.04 K, we conclude that according to the ACRIM TSI composite

±

±

the Sun may have minimally contributed

10-30% of the 1980-2002 global surface warming.

∼

Lastly, we compare the observed 11-year temperature cycle amplitude, A7,temp = 0.10

±
0.01 K, with that estimated by some theoretical climate models. By adopting three energy

balance models, Stevens and North [1996] show in their ﬁgure 15 that 11-year TSI cycle

forcing since 1980 would imprint 11-year global surface temperature cycles with an ampli-

tude Atemp

0.06

0.01K; the MAGICC climate model by Wigley gives Atemp

0.035K

≈

±

≈

[Foukal et al., 2004]. Consequently, our estimate of the 11-year temperature cycle A7,temp

is approximately 1.5-3 times larger than what these models predict. Douglass and Clader

[2002] arrived to a similar conclusion about the Wigley’s model. Thus, while the theoretical

models approximately predict the relative climate sensitivity ratio Z8/Z7 and the response

time-lag, they seem to disagree from each other about the actual climate sensitivity to so-

lar variation and signiﬁcantly underestimate the phenomenological climate sensitivities to

solar cycles as we have estimated. Evidently, either the empirical evidence deriving from

the deconstruction of the surface temperature is deceptive, or the models are inadequate

because of the diﬃculty of modeling climate in general and a lack of knowledge of climate

sensitivity to solar variations in particular. As Lean [2005] noted, the models might be

inadequate: (1) in their parameterizations of climate feedbacks and atmosphere-ocean cou-

pling; (2) in their neglect of indirect response by the stratosphere and of possible additional

7

climate eﬀects linked to solar magnetic ﬁeld, UV radiation, solar ﬂares and cosmic ray in-

tensity modulations; (3) there might be other possible natural ampliﬁcation mechanisms

deriving from internal modes of climate variability which are not included in the models.

All the above mechanisms would be automatically considered and indirectly included in our

phenomenological approach.

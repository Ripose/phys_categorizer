Abstract

We detected phase jumps of the Free Core Nutation (FCN) of the Earth directly from the
analysis of the Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) observation of the Earth rotation for
the period 1984-2003 by applying the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ) method and the
Short-time Periodogram with the Gabor function (SPG) method. During the period, the FCN
had two signiﬁcant phase jumps in 1992 and 1998. These epochs coincide with the reported
occurrence of geomagnetic jerks.

Introduction

The Earth rotation possesses a free nutational mode rotating clockwise (retrograde) with the period
about 430 sidereal days as viewed from the inertial frame. This mode, named as the Free Core
Nutation (FCN), appears since the Earth has a rotating and elliptical ﬂuid core (Toomre, 1974).
The FCN inﬂuences the Earth rotation in two diﬀerent ways; (1)the modiﬁcation of forced nutation
terms through a indirect response as a non-rigid body, and (2)the appearance of free oscillation
modes as direct eﬀects. Investigation of the FCN is important in order not only to improve theo-
retical modeling of the nutations but also to understand nature of the Earth interior. For instance,
the period of the FCN is closely related to the dynamical ellipticity of the liquid outer core while
the quality factor (Q-value) of the FCN is related to the viscosity of the outer liquid core and the
core-mantle coupling (Sasao, 1980; Getino and Ferrandiz, 2000).

The time variation of the FCN amplitude has been well studied from the direct eﬀect in the
VLBI data (e.g. Shirai and Fukushima, 2001b; Dehant et al., 2003). A recent research also suggests
that the atmosphere could have suﬃcient power to excite the FCN amplitude observed (Dehant
et al., 2003) and huge earthquakes could cause impulsive changes of the FCN amplitude (Shirai
and Fukushima 2001b). In contrast, most of recent determinations of the FCN period are based
on the estimation of the indirect eﬀect using VLBI nutation of the Earth rotation (e.g. Shirai
and Fukushima, 2001a) or monitoring of the tidal variation of the gravity (e.g. Sato et al., 1994).
Usually these works assumed the FCN period is as constant value. Therefore the time variation of
the FCN period is unavailable. Exceptions are Roosbeek et al. (1999) and Hinderer et al. (2000),
who analyzed the time variation of the FCN period from the indirect eﬀect in the VLBI data.
They concluded that the FCN period has been stable with a precision of three sidereal days. One
disadvantage of the determinations based on the indirect eﬀects is that the time variation of the
FCN phase is ignored. In general, the analysis of the time variation of the FCN frequency consists
of two factors; that in period and that in phase. However the time variation of the FCN phase

is not studied yet. By directly applying the Wavelet Weighted Z-Transform (WWZ) method and
the Short-time Periodogram with Gabor function (SPG) method to the VLBI nutation data, we
revealed the time variation of the FCN phase and suggest its geophysical cause.

2 Method of Analysis

The methods we deployed in the analysis are the WWZ method and the SPG method. Each
method has its own advantages and disadvantages. The WWZ method was initially developed
for the period analysis of variable stars by (Foster, 1996), where time series of data are unevenly
sampled. One of its merits is that the WWZ traces the time variation of both the amplitude and
period at the same time. On the other hands, this method can not treat complex-valued data,
or vector data in general, and does not take care of the data with diﬀerent weights. The WWZ
method does not cover all the requirements of FCN analysis, where the data are usually expressed
in a complex value (Shirai and Fukushima, 2001a) as

ζF CN = ∆ψF CN sin ǫ0 + i∆ǫF CN .

(1)

Here ∆ψF CN is the FCN in longitude, ∆ǫF CN is that in obliquity, and ǫ0 is the obliquity of ecliptic
at J2000.0. Note ∆ψF CN and ∆ǫF CN are two projections components of axis motion of the Earth
rotation in rectangular coordinates viewed from the space. Also the VLBI data set contain the
information on the weights of observed values of ζF CN . Then its consideration is important for the
data before 1990, when the observation was not so precise.

The SPG method was developed by ourselves to handle unevenly sampled and complex-valued
in two-dimension) time series with the weights. Let us consider some sinusoidal signals

(i.e.,
embedded in unevenly sampled and complex observation time series as

with varied observation formal errors, respectively δxj and δyj. Here the subscript j on values
corresponds to those at tj. Firstly, we assume that the data are associated with the standard
weights

In addition to that, we adopted the Gabor function based on the Gaussian function as an optimized
window function for the time-frequency analysis (Gabor, 1946).

where

Here α is a trade-oﬀ parameter between time-resolution and frequency-resolution and b is a center
epoch for the time shift. Namely the larger α corresponds to the better frequency resolution.
The time-frequency analysis would be achieved by shifting b discretely as bk = b0 + ∆bk where

To trace period changes during observation period, we just pick up the frequency of the maximum
amplitudes from the periodgram at each epochs. One disadvantage of this method is that the
accurate time variation of the amplitude is unavailable. Note that the estimated frequency variation
would include not only the time variation of the FCN period but also that of its phase.

We performed a simple simulation with artiﬁcial test data to compare eﬀectiveness of these
methods. We created a test data set of unevenly sampled chirp signals whose frequency is slowly
changing as a linear function of time (f = f0 + f1t). The timings of sampling were set the same
as those of the actual VLBI data for the FCN analysis. Of course, we added Gaussian noise of
small amplitude. Figure 1 shows that both the WWZ and the SPG methods precisely traced the
chirp signal. We conﬁrmed existence of the so-called edge eﬀects, which has already been reported
(Foster, 1996; Malkin and Terentev, 2003), is observed around the ﬁrst and last 2 to 3 years. In
the viewpoint of the RMS after ﬁtting, we conclude that the SPG method is superior to the WWZ
method. In fact, the RMS for the SPG method is 3.4 day, which is smaller than 4.5 day, that for
the WWZ method. In any sense, the RMS for both the methods are small enough to trace the
time variation of the FCN frequency of the Earth.

3 Analysis of VLBI data

We used the VLBI nutation data complied by the U.S. Naval Observatory for the period MJD
44089.994 to 52779.206. Figure 2 shows residuals after subtraction of a standard model of the
forced nutation, the IAU2000A (Mathews et al., 2002). Figure 2 clearly illustrates the existence
of the FCN (Vondrak, 2003). Note that nutation data before 1984 will not be used for our later
analysis since they are too noisy and have few data points. In the case of the WWZ method, we
applied it separately to ∆ψ and ∆ǫ without weights. 13:27 2004/07/26This is because the WWZ
method can not handle with the vector data with the variable weights as explained. Figure 3 shows
the large time variation of the FCN frequency. The result estimated by the SPG method is slightly
diﬀerent from that by the WWZ method ,however, they are practically the same, namely with a

3

period diﬀerence less than 10 days. We suppose that the result estimated by the SPG method is
more accurate since the SPG method considers weights while the WWZ does not.

Figure 3: Time variation of the FCN frequency. The result obtained by the WWZ method is mean
of ∆ψ and ∆ǫ since we applied the WWZ method to them separately.

The ﬁrst thing we need to consider is whether this result is an artifact or not. The results of
the numerical tests strongly suggests that this large time variation is not an artifact since the RMS
of residuals measured in period is of the order of several days. The consistency between the results
estimated by two diﬀerent approaches, namely the SPG method based on the periodogram and
the WWZ method based on the wavelet transform, also supports that our result is not an artifact.
Secondly we need to consider possibility of contaminations caused by excitations of the FCN since
neither the WWZ method nor the SPG method take care of those eﬀects explicitly. One good
candidate of the FCN excitation mechanism is atmosphere. It is hard to estimate the atmospheric
eﬀects on our result since the atmospheric model in diurnal time scale is not well known. A recent
research suggests that the period of maximum atmospheric excitation varies with time, and it was

mainly responsible for these period and/or phase variation, the maximum time variation should
have happened around 1987. However Figure 2 and 3 show no signs of such eﬀects. Therefore we
conclude that an excitation eﬀect on our result is limited.

Now let us discuss which factor, namely the period or the phase, cause this large time variation
in the FCN frequency. As we mentioned before, the FCN period is closely related to the dynamical
ellipticity of the outer liquid core, which is supposed to be constant at this time scale. Additionally
if FCN period signiﬁcantly changes during the observation, the magnitude of the forced nutation
itself must be also aﬀected through the resonant eﬀect. However the VLBI data show no signs of
such eﬀects. Therefore it is quite natural to treat the FCN period as a constant and assume that
the large time variation of the FCN frequency mainly comes from that of the FCN phase.

4 Discussion

The FCN phase also does not change without forcing changes. Let us discuss the geophysical cause
of this time variation of the FCN phase. We note that ten phase jumps were observed in the
Chandler Wobble (CW) spanning the years 1890-1997 whose durations are between 1 to several
years (Gibert et al. 1998). The CW is another free oscillation of polar motion of the Earth and
their period is close to 435 mean solar days as viewed from the terrestrial frame (Lambeck, 1980).
In detecting the phase jumps, the authors assumed a simple model for the phase variation as

Here is N the number of phase jumps, tk, δk, and ak are the mean time, the characteristic duration,
and the amplitude of the k-th phase jump, respectively. The largest phase jump happened in 1925.
It amounted to 152◦ in angle. The broadest duration of the phase jump happened in 1953 and
amounted to 15 years. The above authors also found that the occurrence of the phase jumps
follow those of geomagnetic jerks with a delay not exceeding three years. The geomagnetic jerk is
a rapid change in rate of the secular variation curve of geomagnetic ﬁelds. On the other hands,
the theoretical model suggests that the instability of a layer at the top core and its downward
propagation induce a step in the core-mantle torque strong enough to explain the phase jumps in
the CW (Bellanger et al., 2001).

To reveal the time variation of the FCN phase, we calculated it from the time variation of the
FCN frequency by ﬁxing the FCN period as a constant determined from the indirect eﬀect, namely
430 sidereal days (Shirai and Fukushima, 2001a). Namely we write the deviation of the phase from
a linear function of time as

∆φ(t) = φ(t)

2πνF CN (t

t0)

−

φ(t) =

2πν(t)dt.

t0
Here ν(t) is the observed time variation of the FCN frequency shown in Figure 3, νF CN is the
constant FCN frequency, and ∆φ(t) is the time variation of the FCN phase. This transform means
that we assume that the argument of the circular functions in the functional expression of the
original signal is cast as a sum of a linear and a time variable phase instead of assuming that
the original signal has the function form similar to a harmonic oscillation but with the angular
frequency not constant but function of time. Figure 4 shows ∆φ(t) for the last 20 years. The ﬁgure

indicates that there are two sudden trend changes of the FCN phase in 1992 and 1998. Before and
after those sudden changes in trend, the time variation of the FCN phase is approximated by a
the linear function or ERF function. This characteristic is explained by the same mechanism on
the phase jumps in the CW described as Eq(8) though the numbers of jumps are so diﬀerent, two
versus ten.

Figure 4: Time variation of the FCN phase. The FCN phase has two sudden trend changes in 1992
and 1998. Two arrows plotted present epochs of geomagnetic jerks.

One explanation is that at least one phase jump at a long duration occurred before the obser-
vation period which is responsible for the phase variation before 1992. Unfortunately an accurate
estimation of the parameters of each phase jumps is not feasible due to the limited observation
period. This is mainly because the impacts of the phase jumps happened before 1992 and in 1998
remain beyond the observation period. Without those accurate estimations, it is diﬃcult to per-
form accurate estimations of the parameters of the phase jump happened around 1992. On the
other hands, the geomagnetic jerks occurred twice during the observation period, namely around
1992 and 1998 or 1999 (Huy et al., 1998; Huy et al., 2000; Mandea et al., 2000). These epochs
coincide the dates of the phase jump of the FCN as well as the CW. Regarding a candidate of
the phase jumps before the observation period, the geomagnetic jerk occurred in 1979 (Huy et al.,
1998) while the recent research suggests the other might have occurred in 1983 too (Wardinski et
al, 2003).

5 Conclusion

We detected the phase jumps of the FCN of the Earth directly from the analysis of the VLBI
observation for the period 1984-2003. During the period, the FCN had two signiﬁcant phase jumps
in 1992 and 1998. These epochs coincide with the occurrence of the geomagnetic jerks. We have
only two geomagnetic jerks during the limited observation period and its theoretical model has
not been unavailable yet. On the other hand, around ten phase jumps in the Chandler wobble
are reported to have occurred in the period 1870-1997. Those epochs are also close to those of
the geomagnetic jerks (Gibert et al., 1998; Bellanger et al., 2002). A theoretical model on such
phase jumps is already provided by (Bellanger et al., 2001). We regard that it is important to
analyze the VLBI nutation data of a longer observation period and construct a theoretical model
as well as the CW. The geomagnetic jerk is the rapid change in rate of the secular variation curve

6

of one of geomagnetic ﬁeld. Since its origin is supposed to be inside of the Earth, it is surely an
important issue for the study of the dynamic of the Earth interior, especially the study of the
conductivity properties of the mantle. Therefore this phenomena could be a new diagnostic tool
for the investigation of the Earth’s interior through the VLBI data. Lastly we think it worths to
mention that a trend towards the Earth’s dynamic oblateness J2 also changed suddenly after 1998
(or 1999) (Cox and Chao 2002). Although its geophysical cause(s) are uncertain, they mention
the geomagnetic jerk in 1998 as the potential geophysical cause. Windows application of the SPG
method is available from the author TS.

(Received 23 July 2013)

Three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) on the nonlinear dynamics and
a route to chaos in a rotating ﬂuid subjected to lateral heating is presented here and
discussed in the context of laboratory experiments in the baroclinic annulus. Following
two previous preliminary studies by Maubert and Randriamampianina (2002, 2003), the
ﬂuid used is air rather than a liquid as used in all other previous work. This study
investigated a bifurcation sequence from the axisymmetric ﬂow to a number of complex
ﬂows.

The transition sequence, on increase of the rotation rate, from the axisymmetric solu-
tion via a steady, fully-developed baroclinic wave to chaotic ﬂow followed a variant of the
classical quasi-periodic bifurcation route, starting with a subcritical Hopf and associated
saddle-node bifurcation. This was followed by a sequence of two supercritical Hopf-type
bifurcations, ﬁrst to an amplitude vacillation, then to a three-frequency quasi-periodic
modulated amplitude vacillation (MAV), and ﬁnally to a chaotic MAV. In the context
of the baroclinic annulus this sequence is unusual as the vacillation is usually found on
decrease of the rotation rate from the steady wave ﬂow.

Further transitions of a steady wave with a higher wave number pointed to the possi-
bility that a barotropic instability of the side wall boundary layers and the subsequent
breakdown of these barotropic vortices may play a role in the transition to structural
vacillation and, ultimately, geostrophic turbulence.

1. Introduction and background

Baroclinic instability is one of the dominant energetic processes in the large-scale
atmospheres of the Earth, e.g. Pierrehumbert & Swanson (1995), and other terrestrial
planets, such as Mars, and in the oceans. Its fully-developed form as sloping convection
is strongly nonlinear and has a major role in the transport of heat and momentum in the
atmosphere. Its time-dependent behaviour also exerts a dominant inﬂuence on the intrin-
sic predictability of the atmosphere and the degree of chaotic variability in its large-scale
meteorology, e.g Pierrehumbert & Swanson (1995), Read et al. (1998), Read (2001). An
understanding of the modes of chaotic behaviour associated with baroclinic processes is
therefore of great importance for understanding what determines the predictability of
weather and climate systems.

For more than 50 years, the diﬀerentially-heated, rotating cylindrical annulus has been

2

an archetypal means of studying the properties of fully-developed baroclinic instabil-
ity in the laboratory. Laboratory measurements have enabled the transport properties
of the ﬂow, its detailed structure, and aspects of its time-dependent behaviour to be
studied under a variety of conditions, e.g. Hide & Mason (1975), Pfeﬀer et al. (1980),
Buzyna et al. (1984), Hignett et al. (1985), Read et al. (1992), Fr¨uh & Read (1997). The
system is well known to exhibit a rich variety of diﬀerent ﬂow regimes, depending upon
the imposed conditions (primarily the temperature contrast ∆T and rotation rate Ω),
ranging from steady, axisymmetric circulations through highly symmetric, regular wave
ﬂows to fully-developed geostrophic turbulence.

Almost all laboratory experiments with the baroclinic annulus and numerical simula-
tions have used water, water-glycerol mixtures, or silicone oils. All these have Prandtl
numbers much larger than unity. One study, by Fein & Pfeﬀer (1976), included mercury
with P r = 0.025 and conﬁrmed that the observed basic transitions were unchanged even
at very small Prandtl numbers. That early study, however, did not report on the details
of ﬂow transitions within the non-axisymmetric ﬂow regimes. Even though air is a very
common ﬂuid–and relevant to atmospheric ﬂows as well as the ﬂow in turbomachinery,
no previous detailed study has used air as the working ﬂuid in the annulus. Further-
more, the Prandtl number of air is near unity which could result in revealing phenomena
as the relative thickness of the thermal and velocity boundary layers is similar. This
paper continues two previous studies by Maubert & Randriamampianina (2002, 2003)
which explored the basic ﬂow types found by direct numerical simulation of baroclinic
convection in an air-ﬁlled annulus.

1.1. Aim and outline
The focus of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the onset of baroclinic waves in
an air-ﬁlled rotating annulus, and to follow this through a complete bifurcation sequence
up to a complex ﬂuctuating type of ﬂow, which has not been achieved before with direct
numerical simulation in an even remotely realistic domain such as the simple annulus.
The ﬁndings from the direct numerical simulations are analysed in the framework of
standard bifurcations and discussed in the context of the extensive literature of annulus
experiments with liquids.

The remainder of this section is devoted to a brief background to established bifur-
cations in the baroclinic annulus and the role of the Prandtl number. The model used
for the direct numerical simulations is described in some detail in section 2, followed by
a description of the main techniques used to analyse data from the simulations. Section
4 presents the main results, including an overview of the main regimes observed and
detailed discussions of the ﬂows encountered (a) from m = 2 towards quasi-periodic and
chaotic amplitude vacillations, and (b) from m = 3 towards either quasi-periodic am-
plitude vacillation or structural vacillation via a mixed vacillation regime not previously
identiﬁed in other work. The overall results are discussed in the light of previous work
and wider issues in section 5.

1.2. Bifurcations to chaos in the baroclinic annulus
Rand (1982) has shown that the bifurcations of systems with axially-symmetric geom-
etry and boundary conditions would be expected to lead to the eventual transition to
chaotic behaviour via a quasi-periodic route, provided the frequencies of various forms
of modulation of the waves remain incommensurate, otherwise a period-doubling route
is anticipated. The rotating annulus seems to form an important prototype for ﬂow
systems characterised by axially symmetric boundary conditions, allowing experimental
investigations of the eﬀects of such imposed symmetries on the bifurcations of the sys-

tem. Thus, the onset of regular azimuthally-travelling waves with steady amplitude is
commonly found to be the outcome of the onset of baroclinic instability as parameters
such as Ω are increased from the steady axisymmetric regime. In the following, these
waves are referred to as ’steady waves’ and the frequency associated with the azimuthal
phase velocity is by convention referred to as the ’drift frequency’, ωd. Secondary bifurca-
tions are found to involve the onset of periodic modulations of the initial steady, regular
waves, leading to various forms of periodic ‘vacillation’ with a vacillation frequency, ωv.
Further bifurcations may involve a modulation at a second frequency, ωm, in the form
of a ’modulated vacillation’ or the emergence of other complex ﬂows. These may follow
low-dimensional chaotic dynamics or signal the emergence of turbulent ﬂow, described as
’weak’ or ’strong’ turbulence, respectively by Rand (1982). An important consequence of
the axial symmetry of the boundary conditions, however, is that frequency entrainment
of oscillatory amplitude modulations with the drift frequency of the azimuthal progres-
sion of the baroclinic wave patterns is excluded, on the grounds that there is no physical
mechanism to couple these modes of oscillation. This complete decoupling of the drift
frequency of a travelling wave from any amplitude variation gives rise to the possibility of
observing a quasi-periodic ﬂow with three free frequencies while a generic three-frequency
ﬂow would be likely to be chaotic (cf. Newhouse et al. (1978)). In laboratory experiments,
however, such a quasi-periodic ﬂow has never been observed as even the smallest imper-
fections are suﬃcient to provide the necessary coupling to result in either chaotic ﬂow or
frequency entrainment with its resulting reduction to two independent frequencies. To
our knowledge, also no numerical evidence for a quasi-periodic three-frequency ﬂow from
a numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations has ever been reported.

Extensive experimental studies of transitions to chaotic behaviour in the laboratory by
Read et al. (1992) have demonstrated the onset of ‘baroclinic chaos’ via a quasi-periodic
route, in which a periodic amplitude-modulated wave (‘amplitude vacillation’) develops
a long period secondary modulation, typically involving the instability of a non-harmonic
azimuthal sideband mode. The onset of this secondary modulation was typically found
to be chaotic (from computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent), except when the
modulation frequency was commensurate with the spatial drift frequency. As mentioned
above, this apparent entrainment of the modulation and drift frequencies is not generic
for systems with azimuthally-symmetric boundary conditions, but was almost certainly a
consequence of imperfections in the apparatus and thermocouple array used to measure
the azimuthal thermal structure of the ﬂow, breaking the rotational symmetry of the
boundary conditions. Subsequent work by Fr¨uh & Read (1997) has highlighted that such
entrainments with the azimuthal drift frequency were commonplace in the experiments,
indicating that only very small departures from azimuthal symmetry in the boundary
conditions were suﬃcient to couple intrinsic nonlinear oscillations of the ﬂow with the
azimuthal pattern drift.

1.3. The role of the Prandtl number
The role of ﬂuid properties in inﬂuencing the nonlinear development of baroclinic ﬂows
is another aspect of the problem which has hitherto received relatively little attention.
The Prandtl number P r is a parameter of particular interest, also in the context of other
convection problems. Fein & Pfeﬀer (1976), who carried out a careful survey of the main
ﬂow regimes in a thermally-driven annulus using either mercury, water, or silicon oils,
found signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the onset of baroclinic instability in the region of the
so-called ‘lower symmetric transition’ at low Taylor number, where viscous and thermal
diﬀusion are expected to play a major role. Some substantial diﬀerences in the onset of
various types of regular wave were also noted at higher Taylor numbers. Jonas (1981)

investigated the inﬂuence of Prandtl number on the incidence of various forms of vacilla-
tion, using ﬂuids with P r ranging from 11 to 74. He reported that amplitude vacillation
in particular was signiﬁcantly more widespread at high Prandtl number, though the onset
of ‘structural vacillation’ close to the transition zone at high Taylor number was less sen-
sitive to P r. In all of the published studies so far, however, the range of P r investigated
has either been limited to relatively high values (using liquids based on water, silicon
oils or organic ﬂuids such as diethyl ether) or very low Pr in liquid metals (mercury).
It is remarkable that no experimental work to date has investigated the properties of
baroclinic instability in a ﬂuid with P r = O(1).

Air is a commonplace ﬂuid, with a Prandtl number at room temperature of around 0.7,
and would seem to form an ideal medium in which to investigate the properties of fully-
developed baroclinic instability in a ﬂuid with Pr = O(1). Some initial investigations were
carried out recently by Maubert & Randriamampianina (2003) in an air-ﬁlled rotating
annulus using a pseudo-spectral numerical model, which have successfully demonstrated
the onset of baroclinic instability and the development of some simple vacillations. That
study has now been substantially extended to investigate the onset of various types of
ﬂow in much more detail. The results have exposed a number of new and intriguing
features of fully-developed baroclinic instability in a numerically simulated environment
which is free of experimental imperfections due to probes and/or departures from circular
symmetry, and shed light on a number of issues raised in previous work.

Ta, and the outer cylinder is heated to a constant temperature, Tb > Ta, as shown in
Figure 1. The physical dimensions and ﬂuid properties are listed in Table 1. The whole
cavity rotates at a uniform rate, where the rotation vector Ω = Ωez is anti-parallel to the
gravity vector g =

in their experiments with liquids. The working ﬂuid considered in the present study
is air at ambient temperature, so that P r = 0.707. The ﬂuid is assumed to satisfy

temperature diﬀerences of up to 30K.

2.3. Numerical approach
A pseudo-spectral collocation-Chebyshev and Fourier method is implemented. In the
meridional plane (r, z), each dependent variable is expanded in the approximation space
PN M , composed of Chebyshev polynomials of degrees less than or equal to N and M
respectively in r- and z- directions, while Fourier series are introduced in the azimuthal
direction.

Thus, we have for each dependent variable f (f = Vr, Vφ, Vz, T ):

where Tn and Tm are Chebyshev polynomials of degrees n and m.

This approximation is applied at collocation points, where the diﬀerential equations
are assumed to be satisﬁed exactly (Gottlieb & Orszag (1977), Canuto et al. (1987)). We
have considered the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto points,

The time integration used is second order accurate and is based on a combination

(f ) represents nonlinear terms with the Coriolis term, Fi corresponds to the

time level. The cross terms in the diﬀusion part in the (r, φ) plane resulting from the
use of cylindrical coordinates in (2.1) are treated within
(f ), in order to maintain an
overall second order time accuracy. An equivalent discretisation applies for the transport
equation of the temperature (2.3). For the initial step, we have taken f −1 = f 0. At each
time step, the problem then reduces to the solution of Helmholtz and Poisson equations.
An eﬃcient projection scheme is introduced to solve the coupling between the velocity
and the pressure in (2.1). This algorithm ensures a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld at each
time step, maintains the order of accuracy of the time scheme for each dependent variable
and does not require the use of staggered grids (Hugues & Randriamampianina (1998),
Raspo et al. (2002)). A complete diagonalisation of operators yields simple matrix prod-
ucts for the solution of successive Helmholtz and Poisson equations at each time step
(Haldenwang et al. (1984)). The computations of eigenvalues, eigenvectors and inversion
of corresponding matrices are done once during a preprocessing step.

2.4. Computational details
The numerical code has been previously validated by Randriamampianina et al. (1998)
for a liquid-ﬁlled cavity (P r = 13.07) by comparison of solutions with the detailed re-
sults reported by Hignett et al. (1985) from a combined laboratory and numerical study
presented in Hignett (1985). Very close agreement has been obtained between our results
and measurements for a regular wave ﬂow. Particular attention has been paid to the grid
eﬀect on the solution, which has served as basis for the present study. A grid indepen-
dency of the three-dimensional solution is assumed when the levels of non-harmonics of
the dominant wave amplitude approach the machine precision (10−9).

For the transition from the upper symmetric regime to the regular waves, the initial
conditions corresponded to the steady axisymmetric solution at each azimuthal node
to which a random perturbation was added to the temperature ﬁeld in azimuth. Subse-
quently, the strategy consisted of increasing or decreasing progressively the rotation rate,
without adding any further perturbations, for following successive three-dimensional so-
lutions.

3. Data analysis

The data analysis techniques can be broadly classiﬁed into two-dimensional sections
for visualisation of the ﬁelds, spectral analysis of one-dimensional sections for mode
amplitudes and frequencies, and phase space reconstruction from dynamical systems
theory to provide information on the qualitative class of solution observed.

3.1. Two-dimensional ﬁelds and azimuthal sections
To visualise the ﬂow, both horizontal and vertical cross-sections of the velocity, tempera-
ture, and pressure ﬁelds were used. The horizontal sections shown here are at mid-height,
and the vertical cross-sections are in the r, z-plane at zero azimuthal angle.

For the further parametric analysis, the sequence of instantaneous three-dimensional
ﬁelds was reduced to time series of mode amplitudes in a one-dimensional section. These
could then be used for spectral analyses and phase space reconstructions using techniques
from dynamical systems theory. The sections considered here are azimuthal sections
(rings) at mid-height and, unless speciﬁed otherwise, at mid-radius. These sections then
gave the temporal evolution of the set of azimuthal Fourier modes. To obtain a measure of
the radial structure, other sections were taken also at mid-height but at a quarter of the
gap width from the inner wall and a three quarters, respectively. The normalised space
variables were calculated as the sum of contribution from the Chebyshev polynomials,
evaluated at (r, z) = (0, 0) for each azimuthal Fourier mode for the mid-height, mid-
radius section, and at (r, z) = (
0.5, 0) and (0.5, 0) at the one and three quarter sections,
respectively.

−

3.2. Spectral analysis
From the time series of the variables in the azimuthal sections one can obtain an instanta-
neous or time-averaged spatial spectrum of the azimuthal wave number to calculate both
the average relative amplitudes of each azimuthal wave mode and to show the temporal
evolution of each mode. Each Fourier mode contains information on both the spatial
phase and the amplitude of a particular wave solution. If amplitude variations are much
smaller than the mean amplitude of a wave, the signal in a Fourier mode is dominated by
the drift of that mode in the azimuthal direction. By taking the square-root of the sum
of squares of each pair of sine and cosine modes, only the wave amplitude is retained,
making it possible to investigate small amplitude ﬂuctuations. Both, Fourier mode time
series and wave amplitude time series, were used to calculate power spectra.

3.3. Phase space reconstruction and analysis
Two types of phase portraits and corresponding Poincar´e sections were generated, one
using the Fourier modes as the basis functions and the other using the wave amplitudes.
Both types of phase portraits and Poincar´e sections produced qualitatively equivalent
results for each regime, but the analysis using the wave amplitudes eﬀectively halved the
dimension of the phase space and proved eﬀective in analysing ﬂow of a higher attractor
dimension.

The largest Lyapunov exponent λ1 in a number of cases was estimated using the
method of Wolf et al. (1985) but using the univariate Singular Systems Analysis (SSA)
by Broomhead & King (1986) method to obtain a cleaner embedding of the attractor.
The SSA analysis is essentially a singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix
obtained from the Takens delay matrix, and it concentrates the variance in the signal in
a few leading singular vectors. Read et al. (1992), using experimental measurements, had
found this to be an eﬀective compromise between optimal attractor reconstruction and
computational expense, and has proven a highly eﬀective means of detecting the onset of
chaotic behaviour as λ1 becomes signiﬁcantly positive. The method estimates the largest
Lyapunov exponent from long time series, by tracking the divergence of nearby trajectory
segments on the reconstructed attractor for a speciﬁed time period, the evolution time τE,
and averaging the logarithmic divergence rate over a large ensemble of segments covering
the entire reconstructed attractor. The robustness of the resulting Lyapunov exponent
estimate was tested by repeating the calculation using a range of assumed embedding
dimension, the tolerance of initial perturbations and/or evolution time τE.

4. Results

4.1. The regimes observed

One of our objectives was to delineate a detailed regime diagram for air which was as com-
plete as possible, similar to those already available in literature for various liquids. In Fig-
ure 2 we present a coarse-grained regime diagram obtained from direct simulation of air
inside the same geometry as used by Fowlis & Hide (1965) in their experiments with liq-
uids. This regime diagram uses and extends initial investigation primarily concerned with
the delimitation of the axisymmetric regimes by Maubert & Randriamampianina (2002)
and Maubert & Randriamampianina (2003).

The regime where all perturbations decay to an axisymmetric ﬂow is traditionally
split into a ‘Lower Symmetric’ (LS) regime, where the ﬂow is strongly aﬀected by vis-
cous diﬀusion, and an ‘Upper Symmetric’ (US) regime, where the ﬂow is stabilised by
stratiﬁcation due to the background rotation. Despite the diﬀerent labels and processes
involved, there exists no clear phase transition separating them. At ∆T = 1K, only
the LS axisymmetric solution was found for all values of rotation rates considered up
to a Taylor number of T a = 108. At higher temperature diﬀerences 3K
30K,
we have delineated the transition between the symmetric regimes and regular waves. In
the US regime, characterised by high values of the thermal Rossby number (and small
values of the Taylor number), the heat transfer is still dominated by conduction. This
transition occurs following the criterion reported by Hide (1958) from his experimen-
0.05. Moreover, Hide (1958) mentioned that this
tal observations: Θ
anvil-like curve separating the upper symmetric regimes and the regular waves does not
signiﬁcantly vary with the ﬂuid properties, say the Prandtl number P r, unlike the lower
symmetric transition boundary, e.g. Fein & Pfeﬀer (1976). The computations were not
extended beyond ∆T = 30K, partly for practical reasons and partly because the valid-
ity of the Boussinesq approximation may become debatable when the volume expansion
coeﬃcient, ∆T /T0, becomes much larger than 0.1. As a result, we have only conﬁrmed
the knee of the anvil in Figure 2 but not the upper, almost horizontal section of the
traditional anvil.

ical model. The solid lines show the temperature diﬀerences investigated in this paper and pre-
viously by Maubert & Randriamampianina (2002) and Maubert & Randriamampianina (2003).
The dots on the lines for ∆T = 1, 3, 5K correspond to cases discussed in the earlier papers while
the dots on the line for ∆T = 30K show the cases discussed here. The dashed line indicates
the transition from the symmetric regimes to regular waves, and the dotted line indicates the
transition from regular waves to irregular ﬂow. The line for ∆T = 30K is shown again enlarged
in the insert to identify the diﬀerent regimes observed in this study.

of constant amplitude and drifting at a constant speed in the azimuthal direction. Sub-
stantial hysteresis was found as a result of the coexistence of diﬀerent wave ﬂow solutions
under the same physical conditions, consistent with rotating experiments in liquids and
many other systems of rotating ﬂows in conﬁned conﬁgurations. This phenomenon is also
known as intransitivity. In the present case, each solution resulted from adding to the
axisymmetric solution a small perturbation of a selected wavenumber to the tempera-
ture ﬁeld. However, the maximum wavenumber obtained remained within the empirical

Some vacillation was observed at a higher temperature diﬀerence of ∆T = 30K in a ﬁrst
exploration of this temperature contrast by Maubert & Randriamampianina (2003). The
work reported here continued these observations in a detailed investigation and analysis
of the ﬂow regimes obtained for this value of ∆T . The speciﬁc cases discussed in detail
are summarised in Table 2.

The range of regimes dominated by the azimuthal wave mode m = 2 is summarised
in Figure 3, which shows the equilibrated or time-averaged amplitude of that mode. The
axisymmetric baroclinic circulation was found to become unstable when the Taylor num-
ber was increased from T a = 180, 000 to 182, 500, following which the solution converged
to a steady wave mode m = 2 and its harmonics, as a time-averaged spatial spectrum at

Figure 3. The amplitude of the dominant azimuthal mode, m = 2, at mid-radius. The
dash-dotted lines indicate the global maximum and minimum of the amplitude. The dash-dotted
lines in the 2MAV regime denote the largest amplitude minimum and the smallest amplitude

show the average of the amplitude minimum and maximum for all vacillation cycles, respectively.
The dotted line in the 2AV regime shows the averaged amplitude.

mid-height and mid-radius demonstrates for a qualitatively similar case in Figure 4(a1).
The corresponding temporal spectrum in Fig. 4(a2) of the cosine component of mode
m = 2 shows that the ﬂow consists of a steady wave of constant amplitude travelling at
a ﬁxed angular velocity around the tank. The amplitude of the ﬁrst wave solution and
the step to it from the axisymmetric solution are indicated in the portion of Figure 3
indicated by ’US’ and ’2S’. The regions identiﬁed by ’2AV’ and ’2MAV’ correspond to
time-dependent regimes discussed below in section 4.2.2, and the symbols represent the
minima and maxima of the wave amplitude observed over time.

Decreasing the Taylor number from this ﬁrst wave solution at T a = 182, 500 back
to T a = 180, 000 did not result in a return to the axisymmetric solution but to another
steady wave solution of slightly lower amplitude and higher angular velocity, as indicated
in Figure 3. This hysteresis extended over a small range of Taylor number only, so that
reducing the Taylor number still further to T a = 177, 000, for example, resulted in a slow
decay of the wave back to the axisymmetric solution.

4.2.1. Basic ﬂow structures

An example of a typical m = 2 ﬂow is presented in Figures 5 to 7 of a steady wave,
2S, at a Taylor number of T a = 200, 000. Figure 5 shows temperature contours and the
horizontal velocity ﬁeld at mid-level. These show the breaking of the azimuthal symmetry
into a discrete symmetry of a mode with azimuthal wave number m = 2. The velocity ﬁeld
can be described as a meandering jet stream, with alternating cyclones and anticyclones
on either side of the jet stream. The presence of such a jet at mid-level is indicative of a
signiﬁcant breaking of the antisymmetry of the azimuthal ﬂow about the mid-plane.

The basic, azimuthally-averaged ﬂow associated with the m = 2 waves is illustrated
in Fig. 6. This shows some diﬀerences from the typical azimuthal mean state found in
1. In particular, the temperature ﬁeld
experiments using liquids of Prandtl number
shows relatively weakly-developed sidewall thermal boundary layers and isotherms which
are steeply sloped and nearly vertical in places. On the other hand, the velocity ﬁelds
and azimuthal mean stream lines such as in Fig. 6(b) and (c) indicate that Ekman layers

Stewartson layers are present at both sidewalls.

The baroclinic character of the waves is illustrated in Fig. 7, which displays azimuth-
height sections at mid-radius but with the azimuthal mean ﬂow removed. The pressure
ﬁeld in Fig. 7(a) exhibits the strong ‘westward’ phase tilt with height characteristic of
baroclinically unstable waves, e.g. Hide & Mason (1975). The corresponding temperature
ﬁeld, T ′ in Fig. 7(b), shows a strong m = 2 disturbance with a noticeable eastward phase
tilt over most of the height range, in qualitative resemblance to the classical, linearly
unstable Eady wave, e.g. Hide & Mason (1975). The vertical velocity ﬁeld in Fig. 7(c)
is closely correlated with that of T ′, indicating that the fully-developed wave ﬂow has

optimised the baroclinic release of potential energy in the buoyancy ﬁeld by ensuring
that the upward eddy heat ﬂux w′T ′ is as large as possible, where the w′ and T ′ are
the deviations from the temporal mean and the overbar is the time averaging of their
product. The azimuthally asymmetric nature of this m =2S ﬂow is again clearly apparent,
but in other respects this initial instability evidently develops as a fairly ‘classical’ form
of baroclinic wave with clear similarities to those found for P r
1 (allowing for the
diﬀering balance of diﬀusive eﬀects at P r

4.2.2. Transitions to Amplitude Vacillations

The steady wave solution remained qualitatively the same for increased Taylor number
until after T a = 205, 000, where the wave amplitude increased gradually but the angular
velocity ﬁrst decreased and then increased again. At T a = 207, 500, a noticeable periodic
oscillation of the amplitude was observed, exhibiting the characteristic signature of a
simple Amplitude Vacillation, 2AV in this case. Figure 4 (b1) shows that the time-
averaged spatial wave spectrum for the AV is fundamentally diﬀerent from the steady
waves, with substantial energy in wave modes other than the dominant wavenumber
and its harmonics. The temporal spectra of mode m = 2 in Figure 4 (b2 and b3) now
show a second free frequency in the spectrum of the cosine component (b2) and an
associated peak in the spectrum of the mode amplitude (b3). These two peaks are at
diﬀerent frequencies because the peak in the cosine spectrum is the diﬀerence between
the vacillation and drift frequencies.

The magnitude of that vacillation is indicated by the extreme values for the wave am-
plitude in Figure 3 (a), where the envelope of the vacillation is shown by the maximum
amplitude (the upward pointing triangles) and the minimum amplitude (the downward
Amin)/(Amax +
pointing triangles). It is quantiﬁed by the vacillation index, η = (Amax −
Amin), where Amax and Amin are the amplitude maximum and minimum within a vac-
illation cycle, respectively. This vacillation index increased ﬁrst gradually then more
steeply. This sharp increase in the vacillation index occurred together with the onset of
a slow modulation of the vacillation, 2MAV, adding a third free frequency, as seen in
Figure 4 (c3). While that spectrum is still fairly clear with sharp peaks, the spectra at

T a = 225, 000 and 229, 250 are much broader. The spatial spectra of the MAV ﬂows as
shown in Figures 4 (c1 and d1), however, are indistinguishable from that of the 2AV ﬂow.
An important and novel point to note here is that the progression from a steady wave to
an AV ﬂow on increase of the rotation rate of Taylor number has not usually been seen in
most laboratory experiments using ﬂuids with a Prandtl number of seven and higher (e.g.
Hignett et al. (1985), Read et al. (1992), Koschmieder & White (1981)). In their cases,
the transition to AV was typically found to occur on decrease of the rotation rate (or
T a), where it has been observed that the transition seems to occur earlier the higher the
Prandtl number (Jonas (1981))
. An exception at high Prandtl number seems to be found
†
close to the lower symmetric transition boundary (e.g. Lewis & Nagata (2004)), where
the onset of AV appears via a straightforward supercritical secondary Hopf bifurcation
with respect to T a or Θ, much as found here for air. The present results thus indicate
important roles for P r and T a in determining the nature of the bifurcation to quasi-
periodic AV either as super- or sub-critical with respect to T a or Θ.

4.2.3. Phase portrait analysis

The trajectory in a reconstructed phase space or conﬁguration space provides a way
to demonstrate the diﬀerent qualitative behaviours of the diﬀerent ﬂow regimes. Two
representations were used here and are shown in Figure 8. One representation uses the

† Hignett (1985) has discussed that some of the classiﬁcation by Jonas (1981) was incorrect.
However, a comprehensive synopsis of the rotating annulus literature conﬁrms this phenomenon.

azimuthal sine and cosine modes of a Fourier analysis of the ﬁelds at mid-height and
mid-radius, the other uses the amplitude of the modes thereby removing the phase infor-
mation of the wave. The trajectories, or orbits, in the projection onto the cosine and sine
components of mode m = 2 at mid-radius are shown in Figure 8 (a to d) for the diﬀerent
m = 2 ﬂows, 2S (a), 2AV (b), and two 2MAV cases (c and d). The simple circle in (a)
represents the angular progression in azimuth of a wave with constant amplitude. The
2AV case in (b) shows a thickening of the circle which a Poincar´e section revealed to be a
torus. The large circle dominating in the phase plot in (b) still represents the drift of the
wave while the small circle of the torus cross-section describes the periodic oscillation of
the wave amplitude in the Amplitude Vacillation. Figure 8 (c) still shows some structure
but with more detail which cannot be attributed to a simple oscillation on a torus, and
(d) only retains the obvious structure of the wave mode traveling in azimuth.

If the spatial phase information is separated from the amplitude information, the
amplitudes of diﬀerent modes can also be used to construct an attractor of reduced
dimension in a pseudo-phase space. This in eﬀect removes the drift and its frequency
from the display, the circle in Figure 8 (a) turns into a ﬁxed point, the torus in (b) into
a limit cycle, and a 3-torus into 2-torus. To analyse the 2MAV ﬂow, a Poincar´e section
of the amplitude trajectory is required. A section to the 2MAV case at T a = 220, 000
in Figure 8(e) reveals that the orbit in the amplitude space is a 2-torus, and therefore
that the 2MAV shown in (c) is a 3-torus. This implies that this particular 2MAV ﬂow is

remarkable case since Newhouse et al. (1978) have argued that generic 3-frequency ﬂows

crossing the diﬀerent directions occupy distinct and well-separated regions. As a test for
low-dimensional chaotic behaviour, the largest Lyapunov exponent, λ1, was calculated
for all the AV and MAV cases, using the method of Wolf et al. (1985). As Figure 9
shows, the ﬂows at low Taylor number up to, and including, the 2MAV case at T a =
220, 000 have a largest Lyapunov exponent which cannot be distinguished from zero.
However, λ1 is signiﬁcantly positive for the last two 2MAV cases. A positive Lyapunov
exponent is clear evidence for chaotic solutions, indicating that a clear transition to
low-dimensional chaotic behaviour occurs, but only after the quasi-periodic transition to
2MAV. The intermediate 2MAV case has a value for λ1 which is indistinguishable from
zero, conﬁrming the existence (hinted at above) of a nonchaotic three-frequency ﬂow.

4.3. Transition to m = 3 and higher modes
As T a was increased through the 2MAV regime discussed above, the ﬂow dominated by
105.
m = 2 was found to give way to a new type of ﬂow dominated by m = 3 at T a = 2.3
We consider in this subsection the ﬂow structure and transitions from the m = 3 state
as Taylor number is varied.

4.3.1. Basic ﬂow structures

The basic ﬂow pattern is illustrated in Figures 10 to 12 for a steady wave, 3S, at
106. Figure 10 shows maps in the (r, θ) plane of temperature and velocity
T a = 1.5
vectors at mid-height for a typical m = 3 case. The temperature ﬁelds show the presence
of pronounced ‘plumes’ alternately of warm and cool air, highly concentrated in azimuth
and crossing the annular gap radially in association with strong radial jets.

×

×

The barotropic nature of the fully developed waves in this region of parameter space
is illustrated in Fig. 11, which shows azimuth-height sections of an m = 3 ﬂow at
106. The pressure ﬁeld (Fig. 11(a)) clearly shows very little phase tilt with
T a = 1.5
height, in complete contrast to those in the 2AV regime shown in Figure 7. The tem-
perature ﬁeld in Figure 11(b), too, has a much more complicated structure than for the
m = 2 ﬂows, with highly concentrated plumes of hot and cold air which have very little
slope with height, interspersed with broad regions with relatively very weak horizontal
thermal gradients. The thermal plumes are aligned azimuthally with the regions of strong

(geostrophic) velocity and temperature perturbations. Similarly, the regions of strong
upward vertical velocity (Fig. 11(c)) are also concentrated close to the strongest positive
temperature anomalies, and vice versa, consistent with an optimisation of w′T ′ as before.
Regions of strong downward motion (necessary to satisfy mass conservation) are concen-
trated in plumes or jets adjacent to the strong upwelling jets, forming ‘cross-frontal’
circulations which show some similarities with those inferred for atmospheric frontal re-
gions in developing cyclones (Hoskins (1982)). The overall impression is that the ﬂow in
this region of parameter space is strongly nonlinear and much modiﬁed from the simple,
linearly unstable Eady solution of the corresponding state for m = 2 ﬂows at much lower
Taylor number.

The increasingly barotropic and nonlinear character of the ﬂow at high T a is also ap-
parent in the azimuthal mean ﬂow structure, which is illustrated in Fig. 12. This time, in
contrast to the low T a states (ﬁg. 6), the temperature ﬁeld (Fig. 12(a)) exhibits strongly
developed sidewall thermal boundary layers and relatively weak horizontal thermal gra-
dients in the interior. The near-absence of horizontal thermal contrast in the interior
would suggest (via the geostrophic thermal wind relation) that the zonal ﬂow should be
relatively barotropic. This is conﬁrmed in Fig. 12(b), which shows negative (retrograde)
azimuthal ﬂow at most heights except near the outer cylinder. The zonal mean merid-
ional streamlines (Fig. 12 (c)) exhibit an additional (thermally indirect) ’Ferrel’ cell, in

transport in this case.

4.3.2. Sequence of ﬂow transitions

The onset of m = 3 eﬀectively began a new sequence of bifurcations, since the m = 3
ﬂow at T a = 230, 000 converged to a regular pattern of a steady amplitude of m = 3 and
its harmonics, as shown by the time averaged amplitude spectra in row 1 of Figure 14.
The new solution showed substantial hysteresis relative to the previous m = 2 regime in
that reducing the Taylor number to T a = 200, 000 still gave a steady m = 3 solution.
106 other frequencies
This 3S regime persisted until T a = 1.5
emerged. The sequence of m = 3 ﬂows observed can be illustrated by Figure 13 which
shows the amplitude of the azimuthal mode m = 3, where the solution branch of the
m = 2 ﬂows (Fig. 3) is reproduced to put the m = 3 observation in context.

The sum of all radial modes of the azimuthal mode at mid-radius resulted in an initial
increase of the amplitude on increase of the Taylor number followed by a decrease, which
was mirrored by a continuing increase of the amplitude at a radius of one quarter of
the gap from the inner wall three quarters. This suggested that the radial structure
of the ﬂow was more complex. Approximating the radial structure by half sine waves,
the approximate distribution into the ﬁrst three radial modes, Am,n with m = 3 and
n = 1, 2, 3, can be estimated from the amplitudes, A1/4, A1/2, A3/4 at a radial position
of a quarter, a half, and three-quarters of the gap, respectively, by

observe a substantial regions of hysteresis between the m = 2 branch and the m = 3
branch. Between T a = 400, 000 and T a = 500, 000, the radial structure of the ﬂow
changes whereby (m = 3, n = 3) grows beside (m = 3, n = 1). In terms of the horizontal
structure of the ﬂow, this indicates the emergence of a ﬂow with wave trains near either
side wall. Finally, this solution develops a vacillation which appears as a radial ﬂuctuation
of the eddies or wave maxima. Visually, this vacillation would be classiﬁed as a structural
vacillation since the overall amplitude (still dominated by the ﬁrst radial mode) varies
little, but the exchange between ﬂow or temperature maxima at mid-radius and near the
walls varies the structure of the ﬂow.

4.3.3. Spatial and temporal spectra

Figure 14 shows a set of time-averaged mode spectra in row (1) and corresponding
power spectra for the cosine component of m = 3 (row 2) and for the amplitude of m = 3
in row (3). A steady wave case and a vacillating case are shown. While the transition
from 2S to 2AV discussed above was characterised by a fundamental change in the time-
averaged spectrum, the mode spectra for all wave-3 ﬂows are qualitatively very similar.
The only substantial change is the gradual increase of the ’ﬂoor’ from around 10−5 to
around 10−3.

Because the vacillation of the amplitude is very weak in almost all cases, the power
spectrum of the cosine component of m = 3, the upper of the spectral curves in each plot
in row 2 of Figure 14, is very bland and only shows the distinctly the peak at the drift
frequency of the wave. The power spectrum of the amplitude, however, shows two broad
but distinct peaks, one associated with vacillation of the ﬂow structure and the other with
a slower modulation. We did not observe any periodic vacillation in this set of simulations.
It should be noted, however, that the transients leading to the steady 3S solutions were
characterised by a decaying, periodic oscillation with oscillation frequencies comparable
to the vacillation frequency identiﬁed in Figure 14 (b3).

4.3.4. Phase portraits

×

×

106 and the ﬁnal case at T a = 3.25

Figure 15 shows phase portraits and Poincar´e sections of two vacillating cases, the ﬁrst
106. Since the
time-dependent case at T a = 2
strength of the vacillation is very small compared to the mean amplitude, only the phase
portraits generated from the wave amplitudes are shown; the phase portraits for the
cosine or sine components would only show the circle representing the wave drift. Both
cases show irregular oscillations of the amplitude in the phase portrait of the amplitude
of mode m = 6 against that of m = 3. The Poincar´e section of the phase portrait for
the lower Taylor number in Figure 15 (c), which shows the amplitude of m = 1 against
that of m = 6 at the section where A3 = 0 reveals no obvious structure at all. The
corresponding section for the high Taylor number is also irregular but it appears that
at least the negative crossing points are arranged around a circular structure indicating
the possibility of a fuzzy torus. It has to be noted that the scale of the plots varies
substantially between the two cases with the y-axis 5 times larger and the x-axis 50 times
larger in Figure 15 (d) compared to Figure 15 (c). Due to the computational expense of
the calculations at these high Taylor numbers, the time series at the highest value of Ta,
only covers a few drift periods of the dominant ﬂow feature which is too short to estimate
Lyapunov exponents. For the same reason, it has not been possible to carry out more

5. Discussion

5.1. Regime diagram and onset of baroclinic waves
The overall structure of the regime diagram, presented in Figure 2, is qualitatively and
quantitatively consistent with previous experiments and simulations of the baroclinic
annulus using liquids instead of air. They all show the characteristic anvil shaped tran-
sition curve between axisymmetric ﬂow and regular waves, separating the regimes into
a wave regime, an upper symmetric regime at large Θ, and a lower symmetric regime
at small Θ/small Taylor number, e.g. Fein (1973), Fein & Pfeﬀer (1976), Hide (1958),
Hide & Mason (1975) and Jonas (1981). The upper symmetric regime indicates a ﬂow at
large Θ or thermal Rossby number which is stabilised by strong stratiﬁcation. The tran-
sition from the upper symmetric regime to baroclinic waves appears largely controlled by
a critical thermal Rossby number. The lower symmetric regime is stabilised by viscous
dissipation, and the transition to waves is largely given by a critical Grashof number or
Rayleigh number.

Figure 16. The bifurcation scenario for the transition from the upper symmetric regime to a
steady wave and subsequent vacillations for the m = 2 ﬂows.

Most of these had been performed with ﬂuids of Prandtl number P r >

7 but even
an early study by Fein & Pfeﬀer (1976) using mercury, with P r = 0.025, showed the
same qualitative characteristic anvil shaped stability curve although the onset of waves
was shifted towards higher Taylor numbers by several orders of magnitude. The case of
air with a Prandtl number between that of mercury and water, however, seemed not to
be located between those cases but, if anything, at slightly small values of the Taylor
number. The observations from our simulations suggest that the case of ∆T = 30K is
positioned near the ’knee’ of the classical anvil shape.

∼

The, albeit narrow, hysteresis at the transition between the axisymmetric ﬂow and
the steady wave suggests a subcritical bifurcation. While Hide & Mason (1978) reported
that the transition from the symmetric regimes in an annulus showed hysteresis only if
the upper boundary was a free surface, Koschmieder & White (1981) presented evidence
for the possibility of small hysteresis for the transition to or from the upper symmet-
ric regime. In their experiments, performed with water (P r
7), the hysteresis set in
at a critical Taylor number below which the transition was not hysteretic and above
which the extent of the overlap of the symmetric and wave regimes increased with the
Taylor number. Hysteresis near the ’knee’ of the anvil-shaped marginal stability curve
has not been documented before. Other studies have either reported or assumed a Hopf
bifurcation, e.g. Rand (1982), Miller & Butler (1991), Lewis & Nagata (2004), or the oc-
currence of so-called weak waves prior to the onset of fully-developed baroclinic waves,
Hide & Mason (1978), Jonas (1980). The weak waves have been suggested to be wave
modes which are located near the upper or lower boundary and are decaying in the ﬂuid
interior. No such weak waves were observed in this study, though it has to be said that
weak waves seem to have been observed predominantly at the transition from the upper
symmetric regime at somewhat higher Taylor numbers, well past the knee of the anvil.

5.2. A bifurcation scenario
The transition sequence from the axisymmetric ﬂow through all observed wave 2 ﬂows fol-
lows clear steps of increasing complexity, from axisymmetric ﬂow via a steady wave with
one frequency, a two-frequency ﬂow of a vacillating wave, a quasi-periodic three-frequency

ﬂow of a modulated vacillating wave to, ﬁnally, a chaotic ﬂow. As Hopf bifurcations for
the onset of baroclinic waves and the subsequent onset of amplitude vacillation are of-
ten cited, e.g. Rand (1982), Miller & Butler (1991), Lewis & Nagata (2004), it seemed
obvious to ﬁt the normal form of a Hopf bifurcation to the wave amplitude data. This
transition scenario is reproduced in Figure 16 by showing the mean amplitude and the
envelope of the vacillation.

Since the initial onset of waves is a subcritical transition, a subcritical Hopf bifurcation
and a Fold or saddle-node bifurcation is invoked, e.g. Guckenheimer & Holmes (1983),
T aS)/q]1/2,
Rand (1982). A linear regression to a curve of the form A = A0 + [(T a
using the ﬁve data points from the 2S regime, gave A0 = 0.125 for the wave amplitude
106, and a critical Taylor number
at the saddle-node, a growth parameter of q = 1.50
for the saddle-node of T aS = 177, 500 with a correlation coeﬃcient of r2 = 0.9997. The
’unstable branch’ has been ﬁlled in using this critical Taylor number and a Taylor number
for the location of the unstable Hopf as T a0 = 182, 000.

−

×

The following transition, from the steady wave to the periodic oscillation of the wave
amplitude in the 2AV ﬂow, is consistent with a second Hopf, also known as a Neimark
bifurcation. This is indicated by ﬁtting a square-root function to the vacillation strength
(amplitude maximum minus mean amplitude) for the four simulations in the 2AV regime
as a function of the Taylor number. While this is a standard bifurcation, it is in contrast
to all experience for the onset of amplitude vacillation in a liquid with a range of Prandtl
number between 7 and 30, where the evidence is that vacillation occurs on decreasing the
Taylor number from the steady wave. In those cases, the vacillation is a precursor to a
particular wave mode giving way to, and co-existing with, a ﬂow of lower mode number.
The experiments in mercury by Fein and Pfeﬀer from 1976 at much lower Prandtl number
did not report such details in the wave regime. The consensus for the other experiments
in liquids is that vacillation is much more common in higher Prandtl number, where most
of the wave 2 and 3 domains at P r = 26 in Fr¨uh & Read (1997) were time-dependent,
whereas at P r = 13 and P r = 7 substantial ranges were found where a steady wave was
reported by Hignett (1985), Hignett et al. (1985), James et al. (1981). Some initial ex-
periments carried out in the apparatus used by Hide & Mason (1978), Read et al. (1992),
Fr¨uh & Read (1997) but now using air conﬁrmed at least qualitatively the onset of vac-
illation with increasing Taylor number, consistent with these computational results.

§

The third transition, to a modulated 2MAV was a not surprising continuation of
the ’quasi-periodic route to chaos’ described by Newhouse et al. (1978), see also
6 in
Schuster (1995), but the nature of the initial solution as a quasi-periodic 2MAV with
three independent frequencies was unusual. As was shown by Newhouse et al. (1978),
generic three-frequency ﬂows are expected to be chaotic rather than periodic. Previous
illustrations of the existence of three-frequency quasi-periodic orbits were demonstrated
numerically, with the modulation of a simple circle map by Grebogi et al. (1983b), and in
experiments of convection of mercury in a magnetic ﬁeld by Libchaber et al. (1983). How-
ever, no previous example such a ﬂow has been reported from either numerical or experi-
mental studies of baroclinic waves. All previous reports of quasi-periodic modulated vac-
illations, e.g. by Read et al. (1992) and Fr¨uh & Read (1997), involved frequency-locking
between the drift frequency and the vacillation or modulation frequency. Conversely, no
instance of frequency-locking was observed in the current numerical simulations. This
supports the previously suggested notion that the ubiquitous frequency locking in the
baroclinic annulus relies on a coupling between the spatial phase of the wave and its

there was little diﬀerence between the quasi-periodic and the chaotic versions of the
2MAV. Fitting yet another square-root function to the modulation amplitude over the
vacillation amplitude in the MAV regimes suggests that the onset of modulation in itself
could be consistent with a further supercritical Hopf bifurcation. As there are only three
suﬃcient 2MAV simulations, together with a change in character from quasi-periodic
to chaotic, the assumption of a square-root scaling is conjecture but gives a reasonable
representation of the development of the modulation. Square-root dependent or not, the
growth of the modulation hints at the possible mechanism for the transition from periodic
to chaotic behaviour: the minimum of the amplitude maximum and the maximum of the
amplitude minimum intersect in Figure 16 at a point between the observed periodic ﬂow
at T a = 220, 000 and the ﬁrst chaotic ﬂow at T a = 225, 000. It appears therefore, that the
transition to chaos in this example might not have arisen from the local stretching of the
6.1 in Schuster (1995), but from a crisis as suggested by Grebogi et al. (1983b)
torus,
where the orbit of the quasi-periodic 2MAV intersects the unstable orbit of the 2AV, see
also

6.4 in Schuster (1995).

§

The ﬁnal transition from the m = 2 branch to the steady 3S on the m = 3 solution
branch could also be due to a crisis, this time caused by the collision of the chaotic 2MAV
attractor with the unstable orbit separating the m = 2 and m = 3 solutions. Such a colli-
sion is possible in phase space because the 2MAV ﬂow involves ﬁnite-amplitude variations
of the m = 3 mode, and it is consistent with the conjecture by Grebogi et al. (1983b)
that ’almost all’ sudden changes in chaotic attractors are due to crises. The existence of
an unstable orbit separating the basin of attraction of the m = 2 and m = 3 solutions
is indicated by the dotted line between the two solution branches, following Figure 8 of
Lewis & Nagata (2003).

§

5.3. Transitions on the m = 3 branch
The m = 3 ﬂows also showed a progression from periodic ﬂow of a steady wave, 3S, to
irregular vacillations but following a very diﬀerent route. This route involved a change in
the radial structure of the ﬂow while remaining a simply-periodic ﬂow of a steady wave.
No quasi-periodic ﬂows were observed but the possibility remains that those could exist
at Taylor numbers not covered by the simulations.

The vacillating ﬂows at the very high Taylor number are qualitatively similar to exper-
imental evidence by Fr¨uh & Read (1997) at P r = 26 which they classiﬁed as ’Structural
Vacillation’, also known as ’Tilted-trough vacillation’. That ﬂow was largely dominated
by a simple azimuthal mode (m = 2 in their case), superimposed on which were small
ﬂuctuations consistent with a higher radial mode. While the large scale structure of
the ﬂow was highly regular, the ﬂuctuations were shown by them to be not consistent
with low-dimensional dynamics. The failure to compute reliable dimension estimators
for structural vacillation had previously been reported in two independent experimental
studies by Read et al. (1992) and Guckenheimer & Buzyna (1983).

The signiﬁcantly diﬀerent vertical structure of the steady 3S, by being much more
barotropic, could result in a diﬀerent type of instability altogether. The radial pro-
ﬁle of the azimuthal velocity, shown in Figure 12 (b) suggests a Reynolds number of

at a distance of L

layers by Fr¨uh & Read (1999) suggest that such a Reynolds number is suﬃcient for the
onset of barotropic instability in a Hopf bifurcation which leads to a string of vortices
along the shear layer with a wave number largely determined by the thickness of that
layer. With a critical Taylor number of T ac = 428, 000, the observed growth of the
higher radial mode, shown in Figure 13, is consistent with a square-root dependence up

to the Taylor number of T a = 900, 000. Barotropic instability has also been proposed
by Sch¨ar & Davies (1990) as a mechanism active in the decay of baroclinic waves in the
atmosphere. If this instability has caused the onset of the waves near the side walls, it
is not surprising that the quasi-periodic route to chaos was not followed, as the experi-
ments by Fr¨uh & Read (1999) did not observe quasi-periodic vacillating ﬂows either. The
indication of steps of a period-doubling cascade were observed at large Rossby numbers,
whereas the increase in Taylor number in the baroclinic annulus would result in reducing
the Ekman number in their study. At a Reynolds Re = O(50), they observed only steady
6 and a regime of weak irregular ﬂuctuations
and noise waves of wave number m
≥
(cf their regime diagram in the Re
E plane in Figures 3 in Fr¨uh & Nielsen (2003)).
Fr¨uh & Nielsen (2003) suggested that the onset of time-dependence in the amplitude of
barotropic vortices may rely on local, small-scale vorticity generation at the side walls
rather than a global-mode instability of the ﬂow in the ﬂuid interior.

6. Conclusions

We have presented results from direct numerical simulations of convection in a baro-
clinic annulus ﬁlled with air and put those in the context of sloping convection in liquid-
ﬁlled baroclinic annulus experiments. This investigation, and the two previous studies by
Maubert & Randriamampianina (2002,2003) leading up to this work, followed the most
common procedure of keeping the temperature diﬀerence ﬁxed while varying the rotation
rate of the system. Maubert & Randriamampianina (2002,2003) veriﬁed the transition
curve between the symmetric regimes and wave regimes and they reported the main types
of baroclinic waves usually observed in the baroclinic annulus. The transition curve from
the axisymmetric solution to steady, fully-developed baroclinic waves formed the typical
anvil shape in the T a
Θ parameter plane, in common with all published information on
this transition for liquids covering a range of Prandtl number from 0.025 to 26 (though
not the extreme case published by Fein & Pfeﬀer (1976) for P r = 63).

Table 3 summarises the sequence of ﬂows and bifurcations. The initial baroclinic in-
stability and the development of the m = 2 ﬂows are consistent with the standard
quasi-periodic route to chaos with a few individual aspects, such as the subcritical char-
acter of the ﬁrst Hopf bifurcation and the existence of a rather rare three-frequency

quasi-periodic ﬂow which became chaotic in what could be a crisis. The mode transition
between ﬂows dominated by m = 2 and m = 3, respectively, is also consistent with all
previous evidence for baroclinic waves in the rotating annulus in that it is a sudden mode
transition to a higher wave number on increase of the Taylor number, associated with a
substantial hysteresis.

The results at the highest Taylor number achieved in the study points to a ﬁrst direct
numerical simulation of a structural vacillation. The onset and characteristics of struc-
tural vacillation is less well documented in the literature, where a variety of small-scale
processes have been proposed, e.g. Fr¨uh & Read (1997), such as inertia-gravity waves
observed by Lovegrove et al. (2000). The evidence here points to the occurrence of a
barotropic instability of the steady wave prior to the onset of temporal ﬂuctuations near
the side walls, in which case vorticity generation at the side walls may be a mechanism
in the onset of structural vacillation in the annulus.

Overall, the observations are consistent with the extensive literature on baroclinic
waves in the thermally forced annulus ﬁlled with liquids. This demonstrates the validity
of the numerical model in parameter ranges not previously covered by direct numerical
simulation. The change in Prandtl number from P r
1, however, resulted
in the reversal of the Hopf bifurcation leading to amplitude vacillation. From a physical
point of view it seems sensible to suggest that the relative thickness of the thermal and
velocity boundary layers controls whether the vacillation appears on increase or decrease
of the Taylor number. While this change in itself is rather subtle, it has consequences
for the overall organisation of the regime diagram and the transition from highly regular
to complex ﬂows. This point is not only relevant to baroclinic annulus ﬂows but to all
convective ﬂows, if not ﬂuid dynamical systems in general, where a change in the ﬂuid
properties may lead to apparently minor changes which then cause a fundamental change
in the dynamics over a wide range of forcing parameters.

A New Free Core Nutation Model with Variable Amplitude and
Period

February 4, 2004

Abstract

Three most long and dense VLBI nutation series obtained at the Goddard Space Flight
Center, Institute of Applied Astronomy, and U.S. Naval Observatory were used for investigation
of the Free Core Nutation (FCN) contribution to the celestial pole oﬀset. Some recent studies
have showed that the FCN period or/and phase does not remain constant, but varies in a
rather wide range of about 410–490 days (for equivalent period). To implement this result
in the practice, a new FCN model with variable amplitude and period (phase) is developed.
Comparison of this model with observations shows better agreement than existing one. After
correction of the diﬀerences between observed VLBI nutation series and the IAU2000A model,
they decreased to the level about 100 µas.

Introduction

Free Core Nutation (FCN) of the Earth is predicted more than a century ago as a common rota-
tional mode of a body having an ellipsoidal solid shell and ﬂuid core. Investigation of the FCN
is an important scientiﬁc task. First, the FCN parameters determined from observations provide
valuable, sometimes unique, information about processes in the Earth’s interior. From the practi-
cal point of view, accurate modelling the FCN term, including prediction, is necessary to compute
celestial pole oﬀset with accuracy compatible with modern VLBI observations.

The IAU2000A model based on the MHB2000 model developed in (Mathews, et al., 2002), and
adopted as a new IAU standard can predict a regular part of the nutation with accuracy of about
100 µas. However, the FCN contribution is much larger, up to 400 µas, which yields degradation
It is well known also that
of accuracy in modelling celestial pole oﬀset, if FCN not accounted.
the FCN contribution gives the prevailing contribution to the power spectrum of the diﬀerences
between observed nutation series and modern models.

The IAU2000A model, like the previous ones, is constructed as a Poison series, and does not
include free mode terms, such as the FCN, which cannot be presented as a Poison series term with
predictable parameters. For this reason, FCN parameters are to be determined from the VLBI
observations.

Historically, the FCN frequency is considered as a constant fundamental value included in
transfer function expression describing the relationship between the amplitudes of nutation terms
for real and rigid Earth. Many authors have made an eﬀort to estimate the FCN period and possible
reasons for its excitation (see e.g. Mathews and Shapiro, 1995; Brzezi´nski and Petrov, 1998; Shirai
and Fukushima, 2001a; Herring et al., 2002; Malkin and Terentev, 2003a, 2003b). They found the
FCN period to be in the range of 425–435 solar days, with average value about 430d.

Recently, it was found from a wavelet analysis of VLBI nutation series that the FCN period
likely varies in a range of about 410–490 days (Malkin and Terentev, 2003a, 2003b). This result

is also conﬁrmed by means of another method, Short-time Periodogram with Gabor Function,
proposed by T. Shirai (Shirai et al., 2004). Of course, found variability of the FCN period may
be fully or partially an transformation of the variations of the FCN phase, which may has more
geophysical meaning. However, geophysical considerations of the FCN variability lie beyond of this
study.

In this paper we develop an practical model for computation of the FCN contribution to the
celestial pole oﬀset taken into account variability both amplitude and period (phase) of the FCN
oscillation.

2 Computation of the FCN parameters

Three most long and dense VLBI nutation series obtained at the Goddard Space Flight Center
(GSF), Institute of Applied Astronomy (IAA), and U.S. Naval Observatory (USN), each containing
more than 3000 estimates of the nutation angles for the period from 1979 up to now were used for
investigation of the FCN parameters.

Firstly, estimates of dψ and dε w.r.t. the IAU1976/1980 nutation model computed at the GSF
and USN were transformed to the dXc and dYc w.r.t. IAU2000A model (IAA series already contains
this data).

Then combined series was computed. Since preliminary analysis showed that three input series
are of very similar quality, no weighting was applied, however formal errors reported in the input
series were scaled for uniformity. After that, input series were averaged, saving only epochs present
in all the series. Band-pass Gaussian ﬁltering was applied to the combined series. Transfer function
of the ﬁlter at the FCN frequency is 0.988. Figure 1 shows obtained smoothed diﬀerences between
observed nutation series and the IAU2000A model, and spectrum of the diﬀerences is presented in

At this step we also computed the smoothed values at equally sampled epochs with 20-day step.
However, a smoothed series given at the original epochs also can be used for analysis with a similar
ﬁnal result (Malkin and Terentev, 2003a, 2003b).

The FCN amplitude time series was computed using the simple formula

A(t) =

(dXc(t))2 + (dYc(t))2 ,

Indeed, using such an approach we suppose that all diﬀerences can be attributed to the FCN,

tion terms at the frequencies close to the FCN one, evidently should be accounted for in future
developments.

Finally, the FCN period variation was computed using a wavelet analysis as described in (Malkin

and Terentev, 2003a, 2003b).

3 Computation of the FCN contribution

Let us consider how a model with variable amplitude and period (phase) can be used in practice.
We can describe the FCN term as

Mathematically (not geophysically, indeed!), we can suppose three equivalent models for the

FCN phase Φ(t)

where P is the FCN period, and zero subscripts mean constant values. In other words, we can
consider three models: with variable period and constant phase, variable phase and constant period,
or variable both period and phase. Of course, this is a subject of geophysical consideration, but
doesn not matter for an empiric FCN model using time variations of the FCN parameters found
from analysis of the observed data.

In practice, one can compute Φ(t) as

where ϕ0 is the parameter to be adjusted.

dXc = A(t) sin(Φ(t)) ,
dYc = A(t) cos(Φ(t)) .

Variations of the FCN amplitude P (t) and phase Φ(t) are shown in Figure 3 along with the
corresponding FCN parameters included in the MHB2000 model which is, in fact, also a model
with variable phase and amplitude, though this is not stated explicitly (we used the text of the
FCN NUT routine included in the MHB 2000 code to extract the FCN(MHB) amplitude and phase
variations). One can see that both models show similar behavior of the FCN parameters, however
new approach allow us to get continues, non-inﬂecting and predictable functions A(t) and Φ(t).
Comparing these two models one should keep in mind that MHB2000 model is developed only for
the period till 2001.4, and after this epoch the diﬀerence between the models grows rapidly.

However, the diﬀerences between observed nutation series and model have a noise of various
origins with the rms compatible with the FCN contribution. To estimate the actual contribution of
the FCN model to this noise we have computed rms of diﬀerences between the observations and the
IAU2000A model after applying three diﬀerent FCN models: no FCN (raw diﬀerences), extracting
the MHB2000 FCN term, and extracting the FCN term according to the model described here.
The results are shown in Table 1.

One can see that accounting for the FCN contribution leads to decreasing of the diﬀerences.
Especially interesting is the last part of the table corresponding to the period of observations 2002–
2003. Using the MHB2000 FCN model for this period leads to degradation of diﬀerences between
observations and the IAU2000A model, which is natural for this model is developed only for epochs
untill 2001.4.

A FCN model with variable period and phase allow us to try a new approach to FCN prediction.
One can consider two possibilities. The ﬁrst one is a prediction of actual FCN contribution, which
is developed e.g. in (Brzezi´nski and Kosek, 2004). Another possibility is to predict functions A(t)
and Φ(t) separately, and then use predictions to construct the FCN contribution using the formulas
given above. Figure 5 presents a variant of such a prediction obtained using ARMA method. It is
interesting to compare both approaches to a FCN prediction in details. Please note that in our ﬁnal
computation we replaced observed series for the period 1979 with predicted one which seems to
be more accurate taking into account relatively large errors in the VLBI observations made before
1984.

4 Conclusions

We have developed a new FCN model with variable amplitude and period (phase) which provides
a computation of a continuous FCN contribution to the celestial pole oﬀset with good accuracy
for whole interval of the VLBI observations, and convenient prediction of the FCN contribution.
Using this model allow us to reduce the diﬀerences between VLBI observations and model to the
level 100µas.

It is clear that the proposed model is a pure empiric one. Considerable eﬀorts should be
made to understand the physical origin of the variability of the FCN period and/or phase, and its
consequences on a theory of nutation.

The proposed model is routinely used in the VLBI processing at the Institute of Applied As-

tronomy since September 2003.

layering

Abstract

The physical process creating layered structure in planetary rocky bodies is considered
here to be multicomponent solidiﬁcation. This is a uniﬁed alternative approach to the
present interpretations where each layer is reasoned and matched individually. The
Earth’s solidiﬁcation is modelled using the ternary phase diagram Fe-Si-Ni. The four
cotectic concentrations and the four corresponding seismic discontinuity radii have been
used to show that the silicon concentration as a function of the distance R from the
centre of the Earth can be modelled by CSi = Γ(R/RE)2 where Γ = 0.583, RE is the
Earth’s radius and the Ni/Fe ratio is 0.072. Earth would have up to 13 chemically
diﬀerent layers. This model predicts that there are three to four chemically slightly
diﬀerent sublayers in the D” layer and two boundaries in the inner core at radii 870 km
and 1050 km. The observed hemispheric asymmetry in the inner core could follow if
the Ni-concentration slightly varies locally. Although this model can account for all the
layers using only three elements it can not, of course, match the full chemistry of the
real Earth.

1 INTRODUCTION

Whether terrestrial objects in their early stages were in a completely molten state or not
may be a key determinant for their ﬁnal state [1]. Here the observed structure of the Earth
is considered as have been formed by the solidiﬁcation process of an initially liquid Earth.
Gravity acting with thermal convection is assumed to have quadratically stratiﬁed it before the
solidiﬁcation began, rather as the liquid outer core now has a density depending quadratically
on the radial distance [10].

The main features of the solidiﬁcation process occurring in a multicomponent real planet
can be modeled using a much simpler ﬂuid system having only a few components. In this
paper a ternary system [3, 17] has been used. By having the third component one can reach
more realistic conclusions than has been possible previously using a binary solidiﬁcation model
[8]. On the other hand, a more than three component system would be much harder to analyze
and compare reliably with the data.

The rocky planets’ main two components are silicon and iron. Due to gravity, the lighter
Si is predominantly in the mantle and the heavier Fe in the core. Based on meteorite ﬁndings
it is commonly believed that there is also nickel in the core. This paper considers structure
formation in an Earth-size planet made only of three components, namely Fe, Si and Ni. Ni
occurs only in a small quantity, but is important in the inner core where it is the most abundant
element after Fe. Being lightest, the concentration of Si increases from the centre, while both
Fe and Ni have their maximum concentration there. There is no assumption of a complete
segregation into a silicon mantle and iron core. However, the assumed quadratic increase of
the Si concentration with radius, and similarly decreasing Fe and Ni concentrations, allow the
liquid in the outer core to be much enriched in Fe and depleted in Si. Thus Si represents here
the light element(s) needed to be present in the outer core to produce the seismically deduced
density which is 6-10 % less than that estimated for pure liquid Fe. The identity of the light
component(s) has been discussed for 50 years, the discussion being initiated by Birch [5], and
all this time Si has been included among the leading candidates [16].

When the planet’s surface has cooled enough through thermal radiation into space, surface
solidiﬁcation of Si occurs. The quadratic density proﬁle allows the Si solid crystals to ﬂoat
rather than sink as might occur with a homogeneous density proﬁle. So the solidiﬁcation front
progresses inwards from the surface. The high pressure, despite being combined with high
temperature in the centre of the planet, initiates another solidiﬁcation front starting from the
centre and progressing outwards.

These solidiﬁcation fronts are schematically presented in Fig. 1 where the horizontal axis
represents the concentration of the lightest element and the vertical axis represents some
solidiﬁcation parameter λ which depends on both temperature and pressure. Fluid exists only

2 TERNARY PHASE DIAGRAM OF FE-SI-NI AND

THE SOLIDIFICATION PROCESS

Fig. 2 shows the relevant part of the ternary phase diagram of Fe, Si and Ni at normal pressures
[17], represented here as having the Fe-corner a right angle. Above its horizontal axis is
sketched the Fe-Si binary phase diagram with its temperature dependence shown vertically [17,
4]. It has several critical points on its liquidus surface: between them the crystals precipitating
from the liquid would be made of the compound of Fe and Si indicated on the graph, but
cocrystallization of the crystals of both neighbouring regimes occurs at the critical points.
The Ni component does not inﬂuence the concentrations where the Fe-Si binary system has
its phase boundaries: they would stay the same whatever the third component was. (See, for
instance, the phase diagrams for Fe-Si-O, Fe-Si-Al [4]). All the eutectic type critical points
continue as lines inside the ternary phase diagram. Two peritectic critical points P1 and P2 are
the least well agreed upon [17] and their continuations are omitted although they should be
there, too, but they do not have any role for the Earth since their concentrations correspond
to the still liquid Earth. Otherwise the liquidus line is reliably established from Fe to Si [17].
The vertical edge, the Fe-Ni binary system, needs to be considered here only for small
Ni-concentrations. For k = Ni/(Ni+Fe) ≤ 0.037 there is an Ni-poor δFe(Ni) phase and for
k ≥ 0.05 an Ni-rich γFe(Ni) phase. Between them there is a peritectic regime where both
phases occur. These phase boundaries are extended as straight lines into the interior of the
phase diagram and they join at (Si, Ni) = (0.04, 0.11) where the peritectic type transition
changes to eutectic type [17, 4].

In Fig. 2, the axis of the critical solidiﬁcation parameter λ should be visualized as per-
pendicular to the concentration plane similarly as in the simpler Fig. 1. λ depends on both
temperature and pressure, combined in such a way that the solidiﬁcation process, once started,
continues: the thermal barriers present in phase diagrams for normal pressures are not obsta-
cles here since they can be overcome by the changing pressure. Thus the thermal barriers do
not prevent the liquid line of descent being approximated by a straight line throughout the
ternary phase diagram. The liquid planet’s initial surface concentration is represented by the
point A in Fig. 2. When the liquid is cool enough, Si starts to crystallize out, forming mush:
porous solid having residual liquid in its interstices. The released ﬂuid is enriched in Fe and Ni.
If there were no convection [2, 3], the residual liquid concentration at the solidiﬁcation front
would follow the linear path moving away from the Si-corner. There the ratio of the Ni to Fe

Figure 2: Fe-rich corner of the Fe-Si-Ni ternary phase diagram [17, 4]. Above the horizontal axis the liquidus

surface of the Fe-Si binary phase diagram [17, 4] has been sketched with its four eutectic points and its

diﬀerent crystallization products indicated. The eutectic points continue as cotectic lines into the interior of

the phase diagram. The Fe-Ni axis has a narrow peritectic region, which has been linearly continued towards

the point (Si, Ni)=(0.04, 0.11) where it changes to be a cotectic line. The residual ﬂuid concentration evolves

from A (the initial ﬂuid concentration) along the tie line towards C1 as the Si-mush is solidifying. At C1

a cotectic mixture of Si and FeSi2 is solidifying. After C1 the residual ﬂuid evolves along the same tie line

towards C2, C3, C4 and on to the CMB, solidifying between them a mushy compound and on each Cj a cotectic

mixture of the neighbouring phases. The inner core has been assumed to have started to solidify from the

other end of this same line and the residual ﬂuid concentration on its solidiﬁcation front has now crossed

the peritectic region and has reached the ICB (inner core boundary). The liquid line of descent through A

corresponds to an Ni/(Ni+Fe) ratio of 0.067. For diﬀerent planetary bodies the slope of this line (Ni/(Ni+Fe)

ratio) could vary and the ﬁve possible regions are separated by dotted lines with diﬀerent selections of the

crossed phase boundaries, the number of them being shown in brackets. The dashed line approximates where

the solid fraction in the FeSi phase reaches its maximum.

concentration is constant. However, there is both thermal and compositional convection [3]
which carry the heavy elements (whose density is similar) down and lighter Si up, holding the
concentrations suitably balanced at the front so that the linear path of descent is still followed.
When the liquid concentration reaches the ﬁrst phase boundary at C1 in Fig. 2, a cotectic
crystallization of Si and FeSi2 starts, ﬁrstly inside the earlier formed Si-mush, but ﬁnally as
a new front on its own reaching deeper down than the Si-mush. This cotectic product is also
a mush, but its solid fraction is greater than in the Si-mush. The non-solidifying element is
Ni, which is the heaviest, and would, if in excess, descend under gravity. Thus the liquid line
of descent does not turn along the cotectic line as it would do if there were no convection
[2, 3]. Cotectic solidiﬁcation of Si and FeSi2 continues at C1 as long as there is enough avail-
able Si to crystallize both of them. After that only FeSi2 crystallizes and the residual liquid
concentration continues to increase in Fe and Ni along the line C1C2. When the concentration
reaches the next cotectic line at C2, cocrystallization of FeSi2 and FeSi occurs as long as there
is adequate Si available. When not, the phase FeSi would crystallize alone, releasing only Ni,
which descends below the solidiﬁcation front. The liquid line of descent continues its straight
path. The next cotectic line induces at C3 cocrystallization of FeSi and Fe2Si, consuming all
excess Si. A pure Fe2Si phase follows as the solidiﬁcation front moves further down towards
the planet’s centre. The next crystallization product is the cotectic mixture of Fe2Si and Fe3Si
at C4, followed by pure Fe3Si mush as far as CMB (core-mantle boundary).

For simplicity, the Ni/Fe ratio has been assumed constant along the liquid line of descent,
even near the Fe-Ni edge. Any variation induced by the two diﬀerent solid solutions of Fe(Ni)
or by convection is expected to be at most very small. The iron-rich end of the line represents
the ﬂuid concentration in the centre of the planet. There the crystallization forms a solid
solution of Fe(Ni). When Si is present in small quantities, the solidiﬁcation of Fe(Ni) increases
the amount of Si in the ﬂuid, but since it is the lightest component, it rises. However, a small
amount of this residual liquid is trapped in the interstices of the mush. If k ≥ 0.05 the ﬁrst
solid to form has an Ni-rich γFe(Ni)-structure. When the amounts of Fe and Ni have been
consumed suﬃciently, there would be simultaneous crystallization of both Ni-rich γFe(Ni) and
Ni-poor δFe(Ni). Further solidiﬁcation of Fe and Ni leads to the phase of Ni-poor δFe(Ni), in
the form of mush. If the planet were completely solidiﬁed, this outward growing phase would
meet the downward growing Fe3Si phase.

3 QUANTITATIVE RESULTS CORRESPONDING TO

THE EARTH

The ﬂuid density in the liquid outer core depends in the PREM model [10] quadratically on
radius, and this has motivated the assumption here that the concentration of the initial ﬂuid
depends on the radial variable quadratically: Si is increasing from the centre, Fe and Ni are
decreasing from their maximum value at the centre to some non-zero value at the surface. The
precise quadratic dependence can be inferred from the seismic data as explained below.

All phase boundaries in Fig. 2 are straight lines CN i = kjCSi + bj, which are valid for the
small values of CN i considered here, and the values for kj and bj for each phase boundary were
obtained from the graph in [17] for the four Si-rich lines and from [17, 4] for the two Si-poor
lines. The liquid line of descent CN i = k(1 − CSi) crosses these phase boundaries in 4 points if
k is less than 0.037, in 5 points if 0.037 ≤ k < 0.05, in 6 points if 0.05 ≤ k < 0.092 and again
5 points for 0.092 ≤ k < 0.114. For bigger k there are only 4 crossing points. These regimes
are separated by dotted lines in Fig. 2. The CSi values of these crossing points were sought by
changing the slope of the liquid line of descent in steps of 0.001. Their corresponding R-values
were estimated as discussed below. The coeﬃcient a in the relationship CSi = aR2, together
with k, could then be found by a best ﬁt.

The density discontinuities in the Earth according to the PREM model are presented in
Fig. 3. The discontinuities have been identiﬁed with the phase changes in the ternary phase
diagram. Fig. 3a shows the top 800 km. The outermost layer, crust, varies from 6 km under
the oceans to 80 km below the continents, and is shown shaded. In the three-component Earth
model the crust has been identiﬁed as made of Si crystals. The Si concentration on the cotectic
line Si+FeSi2 has been used paired with both R = 6365 km (appropriate for oceans) and R =
6291 km (appropriate for continents) allowing the ﬁt to ﬁnd the most suitable thickness for the
Si layer. The small density jump seen in PREM at 220 km depth is now known to occur only
locally and is not used. The 400 km depth density jump separating the upper mantle from the
transition zone has been interpreted as corresponding to the end of the cocrystallization of Si
and FeSi2 and to the beginning of the pure FeSi2 phase. This depth is not used in the ﬁt since
only the initiation of the cocrystallization concentrations are available in the phase diagram.
The next seismic discontinuity, which is much weaker and not visible in PREM, occurs at
about 520 km depth, and has been seen in some regions to split into a pair of discontinuities
at about 500 km and 560 km [9], also shown shaded in Fig. 3a. This has been identiﬁed as the
beginning of the cotectic layer of FeSi2+FeSi indicated by the second cotectic line from the
right in the phase diagram. All three R-values were used in the ﬁt, with the corresponding Si
concentration on this phase boundary, to allow the ﬁt suﬃcient freedom to address the radial

6

uncertainty. This cotectic phase would continue until the end of the transition zone. The
density jump at 670 km depth has been interpreted as the beginning of the pure FeSi phase
which makes up the over 2000 km thick lower mantle, down to the D” layer.

The core-mantle boundary (CMB) region is shown in Fig. 3b. It gives (for k < 0.092)
two further restrictions for CSi(R). Since in the lowest mantle there is a special, seismically
distinct D” layer whose thickness is uncertain but varies from about 100 km up to perhaps
300 km in some places [14], the following interpretation has been made. The CMB was used
to estimate where the cotectic crystallization of Fe2Si and Fe3Si occurs and the ﬁt was guided
by this Si concentration combined with R-values RCM B = 3483 km [14] and RCM B + 100 km
to allow some necessary ﬂexibility in its exact location. The upper edge of the D” layer was
sought in the region of the next 100 km (using R-values of 3583 and 3683 km) it being an
adequate interval for the data used. It was interpreted to correspond to the beginning of the
cotectic crystallization of FeSi+Fe2Si. These values guided the ﬁt in this region.

The best ﬁt, with the biggest correlation coeﬃcient and the smallest χ2, was obtained using
the Si-concentrations of these four phase boundaries together with the R-values obtained from
the seismic and/or density discontinuities, calculated for each slope k (Ni/(Ni+Fe) ratio). The
result is that in the ﬂuid CSi = aR2 where a = (1.437 ±0.007).10−8 km−2, and k= 0.067. This,
if scaled by the Earth’s radius RE = 6371 km, gives CSi = Γ(R/RE)2 with Γ = 0.583 which
determines the Si-concentration at point A in Fig. 2. The corresponding Ni/Fe ratio is 0.072.
The ﬁt, with the points guiding it, is presented in Fig. 4. Also shown is the radial dependence
of the other components Ni and Fe, and the radial locations of the phase boundaries and their
chemical structure. Using the Si-concentration formula and the Si-concentrations on the two
remaining lines in the phase diagram, with the same k, one obtains predictions for two distinct
radii (see Fig. 3c and solid dots in Fig. 4) in the inner core where the chemical content and the
crystal structure change. The PREM model does not include this possibility. The innermost
boundary corresponds to R = 870 km and the outer one to R = 1050 km. This allows one
to interpret the seismically isotropic top 100 - 200 km thick layer of the inner core [11, 12]
as the region above R = 1050 km made of Ni-poor δFe(Ni) mush whose interstices have ﬂuid
in them. The layer between 870 and 1050 km is made of both Ni-rich γFe(Ni) and Ni-poor
δFe(Ni) crystals and it belongs to the slightly less isotropic regime in [11]. The innermost
core is made of Ni-rich γFe(Ni) crystals and it includes the more anisotropic regime in [11].
On the other hand, there is already seismic analysis giving strong support for a hypothesis of
ﬁne-scale structure within the top 300 km of the inner core [21], and describing the increase
of anisotropy with depth [19]. The possible hemispheric asymmetry could easily follow if the
Ni/Fe ratio is slightly variable locally.

This model gives the (Si, Ni, Fe) ﬂuid concentrations at the inner core surface to be (0.021,
0.066, 0.913), and at the core-mantle boundary (0.174, 0.055, 0.770). The thickness of the D”

layer is determined by the ﬁt to be 132 km which agrees very well with seismic measurements
[21]. Its uppermost region is made of a cotectic mixture of FeSi and Fe2Si and below it is a
layer of Fe2Si, but the location of their boundary is not available from the model. The core-
mantle boundary is located 72 km below the start of the next layer, cotectically crystallizing
Fe2Si and Fe3Si whose thickness is not known, but is unlikely to be very wide, so that at the
present time the front is probably crystallizing Fe3Si mush as schematically shown in Fig. 3b.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The silicate-rich outer parts and iron-rich inner parts of the planets are the product of mul-
ticomponent solidiﬁcation. Only partial diﬀerentiation of the heavy and light elements needs
to have occurred. It would have been enough that gravity with convection initially stratiﬁed
the ﬂuid in a continuous manner. Here this stratiﬁcation has been shown to depend on the
second power of the radial distance.

The Earth, if modeled by only the three components Fe, Si and Ni, with the Ni/(Ni+Fe)
ratio at the solidiﬁcation front having a constant value 0.067, would generate 13 chemically
diﬀerent layers just via the process of three-component solidiﬁcation. The layers are shown
in Table 1, but omitted from the Table is that each layer after the outermost and innermost
would ﬁrst grow in the interstices of the previous mush. This could reduce the sharpness of
the boundaries. Since the layers in multicomponent solidiﬁcation are knit together by mush
growth the thermal boundary layers, expected to occur for sharp chemical layering, would be
absent. In addition, close to the middle of the one-component phases the solid fraction of the
primary phase reaches its maximum, and this might have been observed in some measurements
about 1000 km above the CMB [20]. Here it is estimated to occur at about R = 4720 km,
1237 km above the CMB.

The phase diagram lets one estimate the ﬂuid concentrations where each cotectic layer ﬁrst
appears without the previous mush (for a constant Ni/Fe ratio). Their radial locations have
been obtained by making an identiﬁcation to seismic discontinuities. The model gives estimates
for the ﬂuid concentrations anywhere in the liquid outer core and especially at the inner core
and core-mantle boundaries. In the outer core the Si-concentration is on average about 11
wt% which agrees very well with the density expectations based on seismic measurements [6].
Similar abundances occur in the Sun. The Si/Fe ratio in the Sun is 0.561 as calculated
using data in [7]. In this Earth model Si/Fe is 0.577 if averaged without any density proﬁle
correction, or 0.520 if a very simple radial density proﬁle correction is employed, both rather
close of the solar value.

This model gives a new, very satisfactory account of the physical and chemical basis of

10

the well-documented seismic layered structure of the Earth. The multitude of elements and
chemicals in the real Earth could possibly increase the number of layers, but it is not likely
that any of the layers described in this paper disappear, since they follow directly from the
binary system of Fe-Si except in the inner core where they follow from the binary system
Fe-Ni. The chemical content of the real Earth is, of course, enriched by the presence of the
other elements. This model considers only the initial solidiﬁcation at the liquidus surface and
does not take into account any later events like late impacts or the recycling of the Earth’s
crust into the mantle at subduction zones, which aﬀect the chemical structure of the topmost
layers.

The seismic discontinuities at 400 and 670 km depth are identiﬁed here with chemical
changes, not pressure-induced structural changes. The transition zone has here two chemically
diﬀerent layers: the upper one corresponds to FeSi2 while the lower one has a mixture of
FeSi2+FeSi. The real chemical structure in these upper layers is known to be much modiﬁed
by the presence of many more elements and the substantial recycling and recrystallisation
of the materials. The model, however, agrees with the chemical type of the lower mantle:
generally assumed to be dominantly (Mg,Fe)SiO3 with perovskite structure. This corresponds
to FeSi in this simpliﬁed model with only three components. Further inclusion of the two
next commonest elements, namely O and Mg, would agree fully with our previous conceptions
of the chemical compounds dominating the lower mantle. Additional lighter elements are, of
course, needed to account for the mantle density in the real Earth, and their solidiﬁcation is
expected to have occurred in the interstices of the ﬁrst solidiﬁed dominating compounds, thus
generating also anisotropy.

This model sheds light on the physical mechanism behind some seismic observations in
the middle of the lower mantle. The solid fraction of FeSi-mush reaches its maximum at
depth of about 1650 km (dashed line in Fig. 2). It would act as a barrier of some strength
to material ﬂow although there is no change in chemical composition across it, only in the
relative abundance of FeSi. A seismic low-velocity layer [13] has been observed to occur at
depths 1400 - 1600 km. Structural and chemical heterogeneity [20] has been suggested to occur
below this barrier at depths 1700 - 2300 km. This heterogeneity is probably a consequence
of the appearance of the cotectically crystallized FeSi and Fe2Si in the interstices of the FeSi
mush.

The D” layer has previously been anticipated to be chemically diﬀerent from the lower
mantle by some authors [18] even if its structure has not yet been agreed upon. The observed
40-60 km thick ridge-like ultra low velocity zone [15] is probably due to the uneven [2] gupeiite
(Fe3Si) mushy layer surface.

The crystal structure of Fe at high pressures is supposed to change from δ to ǫ. There
are not adequate measurements to indicate if this happens also for Fe(Ni) at the inner core

pressures and at the liquidus temperature. But even if both structures γ and δ change to be ǫ
at high pressures, the phases would be diﬀerent due to their diﬀerent Ni-concentrations: the
deepest inner core is rich in Ni, the outermost mushy layer is poor in Ni and the layer between
is a heterogeneous mixture of Ni-rich and Ni-poor Fe.

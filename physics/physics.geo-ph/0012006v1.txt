Abstract

In this paper an attempt is made to verify the hypothesis on the role of geomag-

netic disturbances as a factor determining the intensity of traveling ionospheric dis-

turbances (TIDs). To improve the statistical validity of the data, we have used the

based on the new GLOBDET technology (Afraimovich, 2000a) method involving a

global spatial averaging of disturbance spectra of the total electron content (TEC). To

characterize the TID intensity quantitatively, we suggest that a new global index of

the degree of disturbance should be used, which is equal to the mean value of the rms

variations in TEC within the selected range of spectral periods (of 20–60 min in the

present case). The analysis has been made for a set of 100 to 300 GPS stations, and

for 10 days with a different level of geomagnetic activity (Dst from 0 to -350 nT; the

Kp index from 3 to 9).

It was found that power spectra of daytime TEC variations in the range of 20–

60 min periods under quiet conditions have a power-law form, with the slope index

k = -2.5. With an increase of the level of magnetic disturbance, there is an increase in

total intensity of TIDs, with a concurrent kink of the spectrum caused by an increase

in oscillation intensity in the range of 20–60 min. The TEC variation amplitude is

found to be smaller at night than during the daytime, and the spectrum decreases in

slope, which is indicative of a disproportionate increase in the amplitude of the small-

scale part of the spectrum.

It was found that an increase in the level of geomagnetic activity is accompanied

by an increase in total intensity of TEC; however, it correlates not with the absolute

level of Dst, but with the value of the time derivative of Dst (a maximum correlation

coefﬁcient reaches -0.94). The delay of the TID response of the order of 2 hours is

consistent with the view that TIDs are generated in auroral regions, and propagate

equatorward with the velocity of about 300-400 m/s.

1 Introduction

One of the most important ideas of the origin of ionospheric irregularities and their dynamics is

the wave concept, according to which the experimentally observed irregular structure is the result

of the superposition of wave processes of different origins. For that reason, particular signiﬁcance

in theoretical and experimental studies has been attached to spectral characteristics which make it

possible to identify ionospheric irregularities of different scales.

The irregularities discussed in this paper are classed as traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs),

with a typical spatial size ranging from 100 to 1000 km, and a time period in the range of 20–120

min, and the literature on this subject is quite extensive. A classiﬁcation of TIDs in their sizes

(in particular, their separation into large-scale LS and medium-scale MS disturbances) is rather

arbitrary, and many authors attribute different physical mechanisms to this classiﬁcation.

LS TIDs with typical time periods of 1–2 hours and wavelengths of about 1000 km have been

studied in many publications, including some thorough reviews (Hunsucker, 1982; Hocke and

Schlegel, 1996).

It is commonly accepted that LS TIDs are manifestations of acoustic-gravity

waves (AGW) whose generating regions are located in the auroral zones of the northern and south-

ern hemispheres. These ideas have been conﬁrmed in recent experiments using GPS data (Ho et

al., 1998; Afraimovich et al., 2000b).

There is currently a plethora of views regarding the effectiveness of geomagnetic ﬁeld distur-

bances as the source of medium-scale (MS) TIDs. According to Hunsucker (1982), the auroral

source plays the dominant role for electron density irregularities with typical periods from 10 to

60 min. An enhancement of the variation intensity during geomagnetic disturbances was pointed

out by F¨orster et al. (1994) and Fatkullin et al. (1996).

At the same time Waldock and Jones (1987) showed that the auroral sources perhaps play a

minor role in the generation of MS TIDs recorded at mid-latitudes. Ogawa et al. (1987) hold

that MS TIDs are constantly recorded based on observations from the NNSS satellites, and their

occurrence frequency does not increase under disturbed conditions. A plausible mechanism for

the production of MS TIDs is attributed by some authors to meteorological processes (Bertin et

al., 1975; Waldock and Jones, 1987; Oliver et al., 1997).

On this basis, one is led to conclude that there has been as yet no sufﬁciently convincing evi-

2

dence in support of the hypothesis of the determining contribution of geomagnetic disturbances to

the production of medium–scale TIDs. This is largely caused by the inadequate number and low

spatial resolution of the radio sounding facilities currently in use (ionosondes, incoherent scatter

radars, etc.).

The main characteristics of wave processes are the temporal and spatial spectra. Since the spec-

tra have normally a power-law character, the slope of the spectrum k and the standard deviation of

intensity variations in the frequency range M analyzed (the amplitude scale of the power spectrum)

are the most informative parameters, estimates of which were made in almost all publications of

an experimental or theoretical nature (Drobzhev et al., 1979; Litvinov and Jakovets, 1983; Kaliev

et al., 1988; Fridman, 1990; Yakovets et al., 1999).

Determining the above-mentioned characteristics of disturbances experimentally is of crucial

importance for validating the interpretation of experimental data in terms of different physical

mechanisms of the inhomogeneous structure. Furthermore, a knowledge of irregularity spectra

is required for developing an empirical model of distortions of transionospheric signals used in

special–purpose radio engineering systems of communication, location, and navigation in the me-

ter, decimeter and centimeter ranges.

Published data show a large scatter in estimates of the slope k and of the amplitude scale M

of temporal and spatial spectra (see Section 4). One of the reasons for this scatter might be that

different measuring techniques are used, which differ greatly in spatial and temporal resolution.

However, the main reason is determined by the differing geophysical conditions of separate mea-

surements, and by the large difference in latitude, longitude and local time when carrying out

experiments.

To obtain more reliable information requires carrying out simultaneous measurements over a

large area covering regions with a different local time. However, none of the above-mentioned

methods meets such requirements.

The advent and evolution of a Global Positioning System, GPS, and also the creation on its

basis of widely branched networks of GPS stations (at least 757 sites by November of 2000, the

data from which are placed on the Internet), opened up a new era in remote ionospheric sensing

(Klobuchar, 1997). High-precision measurements of the group and phase delay along the line

of sight (LOS) between the receiver on the ground and transmitters on the GPS system satellites

covering the reception zone are made using two-frequency multichannel receivers of the GPS

system at almost any point of the globe and at any time simultaneously at two coherently coupled

frequencies f1 = 1575.42 MHz and f2 = 1227.60 MHz.

3

One of these authors (Afraimovich, 2000a) has developed a new technology, GLOBDET, for

global detection of ionospheric disturbances of natural and technogenic origins using data from

the international network of two-frequency multichannel receivers of the navigation GPS system

which improves substantially the sensitivity and spatial resolution of experiment.

The objective of this study is to develop, on the basis of the GLOBDET technology, a new

method for estimating global characteristics of the TID spectrum which excels in a higher statisti-

cal reliability that is achieved by a global spatial averaging of the spectra. This method is used to

verify the hypothesis of the determining role of geomagnetic disturbances as the source of TIDs.

The geometry and a general description of experiments are given in Section 2. Section 3 brieﬂy

describes our developed method for determining a global spectrum of TIDs. The method is used

to analyze the data from the international GPS network for 10 days with different levels of ge-

omagnetic disturbance – Section 4. Results obtained are discussed in Section 5 , and compared

with available published data.

2 General description and geometry of the experiment

This study is based on using the data from the global GPS network of receiving stations available

via the Internet. Figure 1 presents the geometry of the global GPS network used in this paper when

analyzing the mean amplitude spectra of total electron content (TEC) disturbances. For some

reasons, slightly differing sets of stations were chosen for different events which were analyzed;

however, the geometry of the experiment for all events was virtually identical. We do not present

here the coordinates of the stations for reasons of space. This information may be obtained at the

electronic address http://lox.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/allCoords.cgi?.

As is evident from Fig. 1, the set of stations selected from the part of the global GPS network

available to us, covers rather densely North America and Europe, and much less densely Asia.

The number of stations on the Paciﬁc and Atlantic oceans is smaller. However, such coverage

of the terrestrial surface makes it possible even today to solve the problem of a global detection

of disturbances with an as yet unprecedented spatial accumulation. This ensures a number of

statistically independent series by two orders of magnitude larger as a minimum than could be

realized by recording UHF signals from geostationary satellites (Davies, 1980; Afraimovich et

al., 1994) or from ﬁrst-generation low-orbit navigation TRANSIT satellites (Evans et al., 1983;

Ogawa, 1987). Thus, in the western hemisphere the corresponding number of stations can, already

today, be as large as 500, and the number of beams to satellites can be no less than 2000-3000.

We carried out an analysis of the data for a set of from 100 to 300 GPS stations and for 10 days

from the time interval 1998-2000, with a different level of geomagnetic disturbance (Dst from -13

to -321 nT; Kp-index from 3 to 9). Table 1 presents information about day numbers, the number

of the stations used m, and extreme values of Dstmin and Kpmax. A total amount of the GPS data

exceeds 5

107 30-s observations.

3 Determining the mean (global) power spectrum of TEC variations and its parameters

Below, we give a brief outline of our developed method for estimating the mean (global) power

spectrum of TEC variations caused by ionospheric irregularities of different scales, on the basis of

processing the data from the international network of two-frequency multichannel receivers of the

GPS navigation system. With the purpose of improving the statistical reliability of the data, we

used the global spatial averaging technique for spectra within the framework of a novel GLOBDET

technology (Afraimovich, 2000a). The method implies using an appropriate processing of TEC

variations that are determined from the GPS data, simultaneously for the entire set of GPS satellites

(as many as 5–10 satellites) ”visible” during a given time interval, at all stations of the global GPS

network used in the analysis.

The standart GPS technology provides a means for wave disturbances detecion based on phase

measurements of TEC at each of spaced two-frequency GPS receivers. A methods of reconstruct-

ing TEC variations from measurements of the ionosphere-induced additional increment of the

group and phase delay of the satellite radio signal was detailed and validated in a series of pub-

lications (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 1992; Afraimovich et al., 1998, 2000b). We reproduce here

where L1λ1 and L2λ2 are additional paths of the radio signal caused by the phase delay in the

ionosphere, (m); L1 and L2 represent the number of phase rotations at the frequencies f1 and

f2; λ1 and λ2 stand for the corresponding wavelengths, (m); const is the unknown initial phase

ambiguity, (m); and nL are errors in determining the phase path, (m).

Phase measurements in the GPS can be made with a high degree of accuracy corresponding to
the error of TEC determination of at least 1014 m−2 when averaged on a 30-second time interval,

with some uncertainty of the initial value of TEC, however (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 1992).

This makes possible detecting ionization irregularities and wave processes in the ionosphere over
a wide range of amplitudes (up to 10−4 of the diurnal TEC variation) and periods (from 24 hours
to 5 min). The unit of TEC T ECU , which is equal to 1016 m−2 and is commonly accepted in the

literature, will be used in the following.

Primary data include series of ”oblique” values of TEC Io(t), as well as the corresponding series

of elevations θ(t) and azimuths α(t) along LOS to the satellite calculated using our developed

CONVTEC program which converts the GPS system standard RINEX-ﬁles on the INTERNET

(Gurtner, 1993).

Unfortunately, for most stations of the global GPS network, the data are provided by the Internet

at time intervals of 30 s, which bounds the TEC variation period below by about 1 min.

A calculation of a single spectrum of TEC variations involves using continuous series of Io(t)

series of a duration of no less than 2.5 hours, thus enabling us to obtain the number of counts equal

to 256 that is convenient for the algorithm of fast Fourier transform (FFT) used in this study. To

obtain a longer series of 512 counts requires a time interval no less than 5 hours long, which is

impracticable because of the limitations of the geometry of experiment with the GPS satellites.

This bounds the range of periods analyzed by us above by about 120 min.

To exclude the variations of the regular ionosphere, as well as trends introduced by the motion of

the satellite, we employ the procedure of removing the linear trend by preliminarily smoothing the

initial series with a selected time window of a duration of about 60 min. This procedure reduces

greatly the amplitude of low-frequency components in the range of periods analyzed, but this does

not affect the qualitative results derived from analyzing the spectrum below.

Series of the values of elevations θ(t) and azimuths α(t) of the beam to the satellite were used

to determine the coordinates of subionospheric points, and to convert the ”oblique” TEC I0(t) to

the corresponding value of the ”vertical” TEC by employing the technique reported by Klobuchar

where Rz is the Earth’s radius, and hmax=300 km is the height of the F2-layer maximum. All

results in this study were obtained for elevations θ(t) larger than 30◦.

By considering an example of the magnetically quiet and magnetically disturbed ionosphere
over the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter facility - MHR (geographical coordinates 42.61◦N,
288.5◦E), we describe brieﬂy the sequence of data processing procedures. Fig. 2a gives an ex-

For comparing the spectra for the quiet and disturbed days, the thin line in Fig. 2d plots a global

a similar manner for the time interval 11:00-13:30 UT by averaging over n = 309 LOS of 161

stations of the global network, Fig. 1, which are relatively uniformly distributed in the western

As a consequence of the statistical independence of partial spectra, the signal/noise ratio, when

the average spectrum is calculated, increases due to incoherent accumulation at least by a factor

of √n, where n is the number of LOS. This is conﬁrmed by a comparison of the resulting sum of

where ~K and ~ω are, respectively, the TID angular vector and the vector of displacement of the

7

The bulk of information about time spectra of different-scale ionospheric irregularities, includ-

ing TIDs, was obtained through transionospheric soundings using signals from geostationary satel-

lites (Davies, 1980; Afraimovich et al., 1994). In this case the velocity ω of the beam to the satellite

at the level of the ionospheric F2 region maximum is much smaller than the velocity V of TIDs,

hence it can be neglected. For low-orbit navigation satellites of the ﬁrst-generation TRANSIT, on

the contrary, the velocity ω exceeds substantially the velocity V of TIDs; therefore, measurements

are interpreted in terms of one-dimensional spatial spectra (Evans et al., 1983). In the case of the

GPS, the velocities can be identical, which will cause the spectral line to be shifted toward the

positive or negative sides.

The resulting value of the frequency can change sign if the modulus of frequency shift

exceeds the value of Ω. This means that in this case the point at which LOS traverses the main

maximum of ionization moves faster than the TID wave, and in the interferometer’s frame of refer-

ence the travelling direction of the equiphase line is reversed with respect to that in the ionosphere.

Such a situation, however, can be of very infrequent occurrence because the velocity ω (usually

not higher than 50-70 m/s when hmax=300 km) is distinctly lower than the mean value of the TID

phase velocity.

spectra.

However, as partial spectra are accumulated, which correspond to all GPS satellites that are

visible over a given time interval, this effect will lead merely to a relatively uniform smearing of

spectral lines because the sign and magnitude of the frequency shift are different for separate LOS.

Thus an averaging over a large number of LOS makes it possible to obtain estimates of average

As is evident from Fig. 2d, the spectrum of a quiet day corresponds reasonably well to a theoret-

ical power spectrum of ionospheric irregularities with a slope of about k=-2.5, and it can therefore

be used as a reference power spectrum. This result is consistent with published estimates of TID

spectrum characteristics obtained in vertical- (Kaliev et al., 1988), oblique-incidence (Gajlit et al.,

1983) and transionospheric radio soundings (Afraimovich et al., 1994). The TEC ﬂuctuation scale

M in the MS range and C in the SS range does not exceed in this case the values 0.4 and 0.007

TECU, respectively.

When comparing the average spectra of TEC variations from July 15, 2000 for the time interval

17:00-19:00 UT with the spectrum from the quiet day of July 29, 1999, one can notice an order-

of-magnitude excess of the TEC disturbance level throughout the spectrum, with the value of the

slope k=-2.56 remaining the same. However, there is also a clear disproportionate (by 1.5 order

of magnitude) increase in TEC variation intensity in the MS range.

8

Still more drastic changes of the ionospheric irregularity spectrum occurred over the same re-

gion just one hour later. Figure 2e presents the time dependence of the disturbed value of the

”vertical” TEC I(t) for station ALGO (satellite number PRN21) for July 15, 2000, for the time

interval 20:00-22:30 UT. For the same series, Fig. 2f plots the dI(t) variations that were ﬁltered

out from the I(t) series by removing the trend with a 60-min window. As is apparent from Fig. 2a,
and from the corresponding lgS2(F ) spectrum, Fig. 2g, the TEC variations increased in power

as a minimum by 2 orders of magnitude as against the time interval 17:00-19:00 UT (Fig. 2b and

2c). Besides, there was an abrupt change in the spectrum slope k =-0.85, which is indicative of

a disproportionate increase in irregularity intensity in the MS and SS parts of the spectrum. The

TEC ﬂuctuation scale M in the MS range and C in the SS range exceeds in this case the values

4.27 and 0.5 TECU, respectively.

The result derived from combining the

spectra for 7 LOS is shown in Fig. 2h by

a thick line. The spectrum has a power-law character, yet with the mean slope k=-1.85, which

differs markedly from the value of k for the magnetically quiet day. The mean intensity M of the

irregularities of the medium-scale part MS increased two orders of magnitude, and the intensity

C of the small-scale part increased immediately by 3 orders of magnitude as compared with the

level of the magnetically quiet day.

As the chief goal of this paper is to obtain the mean characteristics of the TID intensity, in the

discussion to follow we shall be using only the above-mentioned parameters of the spectrum, k

and M .

3.1 Geomagnetic control of the TID spectrum

The dependencies of the TID variation intensities M (t) presented below were obtained by calcu-

lating global spectra for all days listed in Table 1, with the number of stations m for time intervals

of a duration of 2.5 hours with a 1-hour shift, and by a subsequent integration of the spectral den-

sity in the range of 20–60 min periods (see Fig. 2, where boldface dots along the abscissa axis

indicate the MS interval). The integration result is the value of M which is equal to the standard

deviation of TEC variations in the speciﬁed range of periods and is measured in TECU units.

Corresponding data are presented in Figs. 3, 4 and 5, and statistical estimates are listed in Table 1.

3.1.1 Characteristics of the TID spectrum as a function of the universal time UT

The data from the magnetically quiet day of July 29, 2000, characterized by a low level of geo-

magnetic activity and by a reference power spectrum (see Fig. 2d, 2h - thin line), are used here in

9

comparison with characteristics of the TID spectrum during geomagnetic disturbances (line 3 in

Table 1). Figure 3e (thick line) and Fig. 3f (dashes) plot, as a function of the universal time UT,

the Dst-variations of the geomagnetic ﬁeld and the standard deviation of the TEC variations M (t)

in the range of 20–60 min periods for this day.

As is evident from the ﬁgure, shallow, slow Dst-variations over the course of that day were

accompanied by slow, small-amplitude ﬂuctuations caused by TIDs; the mean value M for that

day did not exceed 0.16 TECU. Similar results were also obtained for the other magnetically quiet

day of January 9, 2000 (Fig. 3b - thick line, and Fig. 3c - dashes; line 4 in Table 1).

Let us now consider, for the sake of contrast, a global ionospheric response to a major magnetic

storm of April 6–7, 2000, characterized by a maximum amplitude of Dst-variations as large as

-321 nT (Fig. 3e - thin line; line 5 in Table 1). A maximum value of the Kp index (Fig. 3d) for

this storm was as high as 8. Until about 19:00 UT on April 6, the Dst-variations varied within a

very narrow range, and were close to 0 nT. After that, the value of Dst began to decrease rapidly;

after 19:00 UT it reaches the value -129 nT, and continued decreasing right down to -321 nT.

Fig. 3f plots the dependence M (t) of the standard deviation of TEC variations in the range

of 20–60 min periods (thick line), and the inverted dependence of the time derivative d(Dst)/dt

(relative units; thin line). The derivative d(Dst)/dt was obtained from the dependence Dst(t)

(Fig. 3e) that was smoothed with a 7-hour time window. As is evident from the ﬁgure, an increase

of the level of magnetic disturbance is accompanied by a gradual increase in total intensity of

TIDs; however, it correlates not with the absolute level of Dst but with the value of the time

derivative d(Dst)/dt (the correlation coefﬁcient r in this case is -0.84). A maximum amplitude

Mmax = 1.07 TECU, shown by the arrow in Fig. 3f, exceeds one order of magnitude as a minimum

the corresponding value for the magnetically quiet day of July 29, 1999 (Fig. 3f - dashes).

Similar results were also obtained for other magnetic storms from July 15–16, 2000 (Fig. 3a-c),

August 26–27, and September 24–25, 1998 (Fig. 4), yet a maximum value Mmax in these cases

did not exceed 0.67, 0.32 and 0.42 TECU, respectively (lines 6, 1 and 2 in Table 1).

The delay τ (of about 2 hours) of the increase in TEC intensity with respect to rapid changes in

magnetic ﬁeld strength is easy to explain by taking into consideration that the greatest contribution

in a global averaging of TID spectra is made by the mid-latitude chain of GPS stations. This chain

is at about 2000 km from the southern boundary of the auroral source of TIDs which is produced

during geomagnetic disturbances. TIDs that are generated once this source is produced travel

equatorward with the velocity of order 300-400 m/s (Francis, 1973; Maeda and Handa, 1980;

Hunsucker, 1982; Haykowicz and Hunsucker, 1987; Ma et al., 1998; Hocke and Schlegel, 1996;

10

Ho et al., 1998; Balthazor and Moffett, 1999; Hall et al., 1999; Afraimovich et al., 2000b).

4 Characteristics of the TID spectrum as a function of the local time LT

For studying the diurnal dependence of TID spectrum characteristics, we carried out an averaging

of the spectra with due regard for the local time LT for each GPS station. In doing so, it should

be taken into consideration that as a consequence of the nonuniform distribution of the stations,

the contribution of the mid-latitude stations in North America and, to a lesser extent, in Europe is

predominant (see Fig. 1).

Figure 5 plots the diurnal LT-dependencies of the slope index k of the power spectrum of TIDs

– a), and of the standard deviation of the TEC variations M (t) in the range of 20–60 min periods

– b) for the magnetically quiet day of July 29, 1999. As is evident from the ﬁgure, the value of

the slope index k=-2.5 remains virtually unchanged over the course of that day, as does the mean

value M (t) which does not exceed 0.15 TECU.

However, for the other magnetically quiet day, January 9, 2000 (Fig. 5c, d), one can notice a

conspicuous diurnal dependence of both the slope index k(t) and the TID intensity M (t). Also, a

maximum value of M (t) is as high as 0.8 TECU around noon, and a maximum slope index k is

as high as -2.7.

Thus, according to our data, the power spectra of the daytime TEC variations in the range of 20–

60 min periods under quiet conditions have a power-law form with the slope index k=-2.5. With

the increasing level of geomagnetic disturbance, there is an increase in total intensity of TIDs,

with a concurrent kink of the spectrum caused by an increase in ﬂuctuation intensity in the range

of 20–60 min. The TEC variation amplitude is smaller at night than during the daytime, and the

spectrum decreases in slope, which is indicative of a disproportionate growth of the amplitude of

the small-scale part of the spectrum.

The above-mentioned characteristic features of the diurnal variation of these parameters are

most pronounced during a major magnetic storm of April 6, 2000 - Fig. 5e, f and, to a lesser

extent, during the magnetic storm of July 15, 2000 - Fig. 5g, h).

The peculiarities of the diurnal variation in TID intensity pointed out above are consistent with

evidence acquired using signals from geostationary satellites (Jacobson et al., 1995; Oliver et al.,

1997; Afraimovich et al., 1999).

The characteristics of the spectra which we have obtained are in reasonably good agreement

with a number of reported results, despite the fact that the published data show a large scatter in

11

estimates of the slope k (as well as of the amplitude scale M of temporal and spatial spectra).

One-dimensional spatial spectra can be obtained through direct measurements of variations in

local electron density along the satellite path; however, published data mostly refer to the equa-

torial or polar regions. Thus, by investigating the equatorial F region of the ionosphere simul-

taneously through in-situ measurements by satellites AE-E and radio probing using signals from

the geostationary Wideband satellite at 137 and 378 MHz frequencies, Livingston et al. (1981)

found that the one-dimensional spatial spectrum in the range of scales of 10-100 km has a power

character with the slope index k of about -2.

Rocket measurements of electron densities in the F region of the auroral ionosphere made

concurrently with incoherent scatter radar measurements and radio probing using signals from the

geostationary Wideband satellite at Chatanika (Kelley et al., 1980) showed that the corresponding

slope index k of the one-dimensional spatial spectrum for the range of 0.1-200 km scales lies

within -1.2-1.8.

For 500 km altitude, estimates of the slope of the one-dimensional spatial spectrum were ob-

tained from in-situ measurements aboard the ”Cosmos-900” satellite by Gdalevich et al. (1980).

While for the equatorial and high-latitude ionosphere the values of k were of order -1.2, the spec-

trum for the mid-latitudes showed a kink; in the range of 30-150 km scales, k = -3-4, and it

decreases to -1.0 for irregularities smaller than 30 km.

An alternative possibility involves transferring the temporal spectrum to the spatial region pro-

vided that the traveling inhomogeneous structure is ”frozen-in”. In this case the form of the spatial

spectrum is identical to that of the temporal spectrum. Such an approach in processing measure-

ments of the frequency Doppler shift at oblique-incidence soundings was used, in particular, by

Gajlit et al. (1983); a corresponding estimate of the index k for ionospheric irregularities with the

size from a few tens to several hundred kilometers was obtained by these authors in the range of

-3.8-4.6. Furthermore, the index k for the spectra of the frequency Doppler shift varied within

-0.8-1.6. Similar results in identical Doppler measurements were obtained by Kaliev et al. (1988);

the k from the data on average spectra was -2 both during the daytime and at night.

Afraimovich et al. (1994) investigated the spectral properties of medium-scale TIDs on the basis

of analyzing power spectra of TEC variations obtained by measuring the polarization of the signal
from geostationary satellite ETS-2 at 136 MHz frequency near Irkutsk (52◦ N, 102◦ E). For three

seasons of 1990, temporal spectra of TEC variations, averaged over 10 days, were obtained. In the

low-frequency range (periods from 100 to 20 min) the daytime variation spectra have a power-law

form, with the slope index - 2.5, while in the high-frequency range (periods of 20–10 min) they are

12

with the index - 6; at night, the index is - 4 throughout the range of periods under consideration.

5 Discussion and conclusion

The main results of this study may be summarized as follows:

1. Our ﬁndings bear witness to the determining role of geomagnetic disturbances in the for-

mation of the spectrum of traveling ionospheric disturbances. This conclusion is based on

substantially more extensive (than obtained earlier) statistical material, spans periods with

a different level of geomagnetic disturbance, and has a global character. The analysis has

been made for a set of 100 to 300 GPS stations, and for 10 days with a different level of

geomagnetic activity (Dst from 0 to -350 nT; the Kp index from 3 to 9).

2. It was found that power spectra of daytime TEC variations in the range of 20–60 min periods

under quiet conditions have a power-law form, with the slope index k=-2.5. With an increase

of the level of magnetic disturbance, there is an increase in total intensity of TIDs, with a

concurrent kink of the spectrum caused by an increase in oscillation intensity in the range

of 20–60 min. The TEC variation amplitude is found to be smaller at night than during

the daytime, and the spectrum decreases in slope, which is indicative of a disproportionate

increase in the amplitude of the small–scale part of the spectrum.

3. It was found that an increase in the level of geomagnetic activity is accompanied by an

increase in total intensity of TEC; however, it correlates not with the absolute level of Dst,

but with the value of the time derivative of Dst (a maximum correlation coefﬁcient reaches

4. The delay of the TID response of the order of 2 hours is consistent with the view that TIDs

are generated in auroral regions, and propagate equatorward with the velocity of about 300–

-0.94).

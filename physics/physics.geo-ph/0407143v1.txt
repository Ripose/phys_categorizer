Abstract

Weekly coordinate time series for the all EPN (European Permanent GPS Network) stations
for the period of observations beginning from GPS week 834 was obtained by a reprocessing
of the oﬃcial EPN solutions. Comparison of this series with EPN Central Bureau (EPN CB)
and the previous IAA two-year solution for selected EPN stations obtained by reprocessing of
the original observations is performed. Results of comparison show that new solution based on
ﬁducial-free strategy is most likely free of seasonal errors. Now the new IAA EPN solution is
being computed regularly (on availability of the oﬃcial EPN solution) and is available to any
interested group.

Introduction

GPS observations collected from the European GPS network are widely used for geodesy and
geodynamic researches in the region. The network is coordinated by the EPN CB which also
provides the oﬃcial analysis of the observations. Two EPN weekly solutions are available. The
ﬁrst one is computed at the Bundesamt f¨ur Kartographie und Geod¨asie, Germany (previously
at the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe, Astronomical Institute of the University of
Bern, Switzerland) and distributed as SINEX ﬁles. Hereafter this solution is referred to as EUR.
Unfortunately, this solution is not suitable for high-accuracy geodesy applications because the using
of ﬁducial approach and periodic change of the reference system cause jumps in coordinates and
distortion of the network. Direct use of this solution can lead to some confusions (see e.g.
[1]).
Besides the EUR solution does not contain any information about displacement of the ﬁducial
stations.

The second solution is computed at the EPN CB by reprocessing the previous one and seems
to provide high-quality information about the movement of the all EPN stations. Unfortunately,
this solution is not distributed in SINEX ﬁles, and it is diﬃcult to use it in scientiﬁc analysis.

For these reasons, several years ago the IAA undertook a special project aimed at the compu-
tation of an independent coordinate time series for all the EPN stations. A detailed description of
the project was given in [2].

At the ﬁrst stage the original GPS observations for a selected EPN subnetwork at two-year
interval were reprocessed using ﬁducial-free strategy. Basic theoretical background for this approach
can be found in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Previously this strategy was tested during processing of two
Baltic Sea Level campaigns [5, 10] Obtained coordinate time series appeared to be more stable in
sense of random and systematic errors [8, 9]. It is hereafter referred to as I1.

Unfortunately, this way of reprocessing requires too much resources and we tried two another
approaches. The ﬁrst one is based on reprocessing of existing EUR solutions (the second stage of

1

the IAA project). The processing strategy is described below. Obtained coordinate time series was
compared with other EPN solutions and the previous IAA solution I1. Results of comparison show
that obtained solution is most likely free of seasonal errors.

At the third stage of the our project we plan to obtain an EPN coordinate time series by an
independent combination of individual solutions provided by the EPN Analysis Centers, also using
ﬁducial-free approach. This work is under development and is planned to be completed by the end
of 2003.

2 Processing strategy

Our processing was made in two steps. At the ﬁrst one the EUR solutions are de-constrained using
the a priori coordinates and covariance matrices contained in the SINEX ﬁles following the strategy
proposed in [11].

After this the transformation of the obtained free network solution to the ITRF2000 is made.
Unlike EPN CB strategy, we use for the transformation all the stations presented in the solution
using weights dependent on their position accuracy (taking into account both errors in position
and velocity) in the EUR solution and in the reference ITRF catalogue.

Two solutions were computed: with 6 and 7-parameter Helmert transformation. Solution ob-
tained with 6-parameter transformation is hereafter referred to as I2, solution obtained with 7-
parameter transformation is referred to as I3.

Time series of transformation parameters are shown in Figure 1. One can clearly see the seasonal

and other peculiarities in these time series which should be investigated separately.

Analysis of the solutions obtained by this method showed that the obtained coordinate time
series have a similar quality with the EPN CB solution with some small discrepancies which can be
explained by details of used approaches. However analysis of the errors in the station coordinates
reveals very large irregularities, caused most probably by inconsistency in SINEX blocks (e.g. wrong
scaling of covariance matrices).

To reduce the inconsistency of coordinate errors we used a re-scaling of computed covariance
matrices. The re-scaling factor was chosen in such a way that the mean coordinate error of non-
ﬁducial stations in the EUR solution is equal to the mean coordinate error of the same stations of
the new solution. The plots of mean coordinate errors of our solution with and without re-scaling
of covariance matrices are shown in Figure 2.

3 Comparison and conclusions

Six-year coordinate time series for all EPN stations were computed and compared with two other
solutions (EUR solution and our previous two-year solution for selected european stations). Several
examples are presented in Figure 3. It is seen that all series provide determination of main details
in behavior of station position.

A comparison of four solutions mentioned above is presented in Table 1. The table contains
results of determination of week-to-week repeatability (Allan variance) interpreted as random error
and amplitude of seasonal term in variation of station coordinates in the local ENU system.

Comparison shows that I3 solution obtained using 7-parameter Helmert transformation to the
ITRF2000 provides minimum random error and seasonal variations. Of course, the latter may mean
merely loss of geophysical signal, but comparison with EPN CB series (available at the EPN Web
site) and global solutions (T. Springer, private communication) shows that most likely seasonal
terms observed in the EPN solution is caused by systematic errors induced by errors in modeling
of position of ﬁducial stations.

Evidently, more thorough consideration should be made to make a choice between using 6 or 7-
parameter Helmert transformation of free network solution to ITRF. The ﬁrst impression is that it
is more reasonable to apply 6-parameter transformation to a global network, whereas 7-parameter
transformation is more adequate to regional data.

Now the IAA EPN solutions are being computed regularly using described strategy, on avail-
ability of the oﬃcial EPN solutions, and the results are available to any interested group (on request
at the moment, later it will be put to the Internet).

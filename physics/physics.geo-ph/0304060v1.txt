SUMMARY

We report palaeointensity estimates obtained from three Oligocene volcanic sections

from the Kerguelen Archipelago (Mont des Ruches, Mont des Tempˆetes, and Mont

Rabouill`ere). Of 402 available samples, 102 were suitable for a palaeoﬁeld strength de-

termination after a preliminary selection, among which 49 provide a reliable estimate.

Application of strict a posteriori criteria make us conﬁdent about the quality of the

12 new mean-ﬂow determinations, which are the ﬁrst reliable data available for the

Kerguelen Archipelago. The Virtual Dipole Moments (VDM) calculated for these ﬂows

vary from 2.78 to 9.47 1022 Am2 with an arithmetic mean value of 6.15±2.1 1022 Am2.

Compilation of these results with a selection of the 2002 updated IAGA palaeointensity

database lead to a higher (5.4±2.3 1022Am2) Oligocene mean VDM than previously re-

ported (Goguitchaichvili et al., 2001; Riisager, 1999), identical to the 5.5±2.4 1022Am2

mean VDM obtained for the 0.3-5 Ma time window. However, these Kerguelen palaeoin-

2 G. Plenier, P. Camps, R.S. Coe and M. Perrin

tensity estimates represent half of the reliable Oligocene determinations and thus a bias

toward higher values. Nonetheless, the new estimates reported here strengthen the con-

clusion that the recent geomagnetic ﬁeld strength is anomalously high compared to that

older than 0.3 Ma.

1 INTRODUCTION

Numerous studies have been carried out to increase our knowledge of geodynamo physics,

but even so we still do not know the detailed mechanism of the generation of the Earth’s

magnetic ﬁeld, and even less about the processes that produce secular variation, excursions

and reversals (e.g., Jacobs (1994); Merrill & McFadden (1999)). To better understand the

geomagnetic ﬁeld we need to be able to go back in time in order to observe its changes and

to obtain long-term global characteristics. This is possible with some rocks which recorded

the Earth’s palaeomagnetic ﬁeld during their formation. Volcanic rocks, in particular, fur-

nish a global knowledge of the geomagnetic ﬁeld because they contain information on both

the direction (inclination and declination) and the strength of the palaeoﬁeld. However, the

most reliable methods for absolute palaeointensity determination, Thellier & Thellier (1959)

and its modiﬁed version proposed by Coe (1967a), are time consuming because of the strict

conditions which have to be checked to validate the determinations. Moreover, many vol-

canic rocks turn out to be unsuitable for palaeointensity determination. For these reasons,

reliable palaeointensity data are diﬃcult to obtain and are particularly rare. Only 1.5 de-

terminations per million years between 0 and 300 Ma (Selkin & Tauxe, 2000) are available

when combining the updated IAGA 1999 data-set and the Scripps submarine basaltic glass

databases. It is obvious that more palaeointensity data are needed for a better understand-

ing of the geomagnetic dynamo.

This study on three basaltic sections sampled in the Kerguelen Archipelago (49.9◦S, 70◦E)

aims to estimate more accurately the palaeomagnetic strength of the geomagnetic ﬁeld in

the 28-30 Ma time interval recorded by these lavas. It thus complements the palaeomagnetic

directions recently published on the same sections (Plenier et al., 2002). By combining these

new determinations with selected records issued from preexisting palaeomagnetic databases

(Tanaka et al. (1995), updated by Perrin & Shcherbakov (1997) and Perrin et al. (1998))

we will propose a more robust estimation of the Oligocene palaeoﬁeld strength and we will

discuss the long-term characteristics of the geodynamo.

2 GEOLOGY AND SAMPLING

The Kerguelen Archipelago lies on the northern part of the Kerguelen-Gaussberg Plateau

(southern Indian Ocean). This archipelago is the subaerial continuation of Kerguelen hotspot

volcanism for the last 30 Ma (Yang et al., 1998; Weis et al., 1998; Nicolaysen et al., 2000).

The lava ﬂows form the tabular reliefs (400 to 900 m high) observed today after glacial ero-

sion, and represent more than 85% of the archipelago surface (Giret, 1990). The rest of the

archipelago is composed of intrusions (gabbro, granite, and syenite) issued from Kerguelen

plume melts (Weis & Giret, 1994) and quaternary glacial sediments. We studied paleomag-

netic cores collected along three vertical sections of Kerguelen basalt at Mont des Ruches,

Mont des Tempˆetes, and Mont Rabouill`ere sections (Fig. 1). For the reasons developed in Ple-

nier et al. (2002), the palaeomagnetic sections do not correspond exactly to the previously-

dated sections (Yang et al., 1998; Nicolaysen et al., 2000; Doucet et al., 2002), but they ap-

pear to be correlated. Usually, we drilled seven samples in each successive lava ﬂow using a

gas-powered drill and oriented them with both solar sightings and magnetic compass with

a clinometer. We took care to sample the bottom part of the least altered ﬂows, and as far

away as possible from intrusions.

3 ROCK MAGNETISM AND SAMPLE SELECTION

For ﬁeld intensities comparable to those of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (few tens of µT),

there is a proportionality between the Thermo-Remanent Magnetization (TRM) intensity

measured at 20◦C and the strength of the ancient magnetic ﬁeld present during cooling

through the blocking temperatures for almost all natural rocks. Thus, for some particular

rocks cooling in the geomagnetic ﬁeld during their formation, it is possible to estimate the

palaeomagnetic ﬁeld strength recorded by comparing their Natural Remanent Magnetization

(NRM) with an artiﬁcial TRM acquired in the laboratory under a known ambient ﬁeld.

However, the coeﬃcient of proportionality depends on grain size, shape distribution, and

blocking temperatures as well as on the amount and type of ferromagnetic material the rock

contains. In addition, this coeﬃcient may have changed since the formation of the rock or

during heating in the laboratory. For this last reason, a procedure using numerous successive

heatings with increasing temperature steps has been developed (Thellier & Thellier, 1959) in

order to limit the ﬁeld strength estimates to the temperature range preceding the irreversible

magnetic and/or chemical changes in the ferromagnetic minerals. The strict conditions to

be respected by the samples for correct palaeointensity determination are the following:

(i) The Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) recorded by the studied speci-

men has to be a TRM, acquired at a known epoch in the geomagnetic ﬁeld.

(ii) The ChRM should not be disturbed by signiﬁcant secondary magnetizations.

(iii) The physical, chemical and crystallographical properties of the magnetic minerals

must not have changed since the initial TRM was acquired nor changed during the successive

heatings imposed by the experimental method.

(iv) The independence and additivity laws of partial-TRM (pTRM) enunciated by Thel-

lier (1938) have to be satisﬁed. That is, the total TRM must be equivalent to a sum of

pTRMs, each associated with its own blocking temperature interval and not dependent on

the remanence carried in every other intervals. This generally means that the magnetic

carriers have to be single domain (SD) or in favorable cases pseudo-single domain (PSD)

grains.

It is obvious that numerous samples can not fulﬁll these conditions, thus extensive prelimi-

nary studies are necessary to avoid unnecessary work.

3.1 Viscosity indices and demagnetizations

We shown recently (Plenier et al., 2002) by means of a positive reversal test that the ChRM

measured from Kerguelen lava are, generally speaking, not disturbed by unremoved sec-

ondary components and then that these ChRMs are primary TRMs. In order to assess the

importance of the secondary component carried by each sample, we analyzed the results from

demagnetization experiments performed previously on sister specimens (Plenier et al., 2002).

First, we rejected samples for which the angle between the NRM and the ChRM was greater

than 15◦ and those contaminated by a resistant secondary component (e.g., unremoved be-

yond 20 mT alternating ﬁelds treatment or 300◦C when samples are demagnetized by heating

in zero ﬁeld). Likewise, we kept only those ﬂows for which the NRMs of all samples were well

grouped. 60% of the ﬂows fulﬁlled these conditions. For these ﬂows, only the samples with a

demagnetization curve as undisturbed as possible and presenting unblocking temperatures

as high as possible, or median-demagnetization ﬁeld of at least 20 mT, were retained.

Second, we estimated the capacity of the specimens to gain a secondary Viscous Remanent

Magnetization (VRM) by measuring them ﬁrst after two weeks in the ambient magnetic ﬁeld

oriented along the z core axis and again, after two-week storage in a zero ﬁeld. This enables

determination of the viscosity index (Thellier & Thellier, 1944) for each sample, which are

reported in Table 1. The viscosity index corresponds to about 25% of the VRM acquired in

situ since the last reversal 780 ky ago (Pr´evot, 1981). We choose the arbitrarily thresholds

for the viscosity index of 10% as an upper limit for specimen from intermediate polarity ﬂow

and 5% for the others (Pr´evot et al., 1985).

3.2 Susceptibility at room temperature and k-T curves

To be sure of the thermal stability of the samples during successive heating in the labo-

ratory, we used the low-ﬁeld magnetic susceptibility (k0) measured at room temperature

6 G. Plenier, P. Camps, R.S. Coe and M. Perrin

after each thermal demagnetization step performed in air for the sister specimen previously

studied in the palaeodirection determination (Plenier et al., 2002). A favorable sample for

palaeointensity determination should have a relatively constant k0 value during most of

the demagnetization procedure. However, this is not a suﬃcient criterion because thermally

unstable samples may nonetheless display low variations in the susceptibility measured at

room temperature. Thus to complete this approach, we measured continuously the low-ﬁeld

susceptibility of one sample from each ﬂow usually during two successive heating-cooling

cycles under vacuum, the ﬁrst up to 350◦C and the second up to the Curie temperature

(Tc). Fig. 2 presents two representative k-T curves (susceptibility as a function of tempera-

ture) encountered during this study. The ﬁrst case (Fig. 2a) illustrates the irreversible and

complex thermomagnetic behaviour observed for almost 60% of the samples. The magnetic

carriers are interpreted as original titanomagnetite associated with titanomaghemite, a prod-

uct of their low temperature oxidation. We rejected the ﬂows yielding this behaviour because

of their thermal instability. The second case (Fig. 2b) illustrates the reversible behaviour

observed for the rest of the samples. The magnetic carriers are low-Ti titanomagnetites

probably produced by high temperature oxyexsolution of the original titanomagnetites. We

considered ﬂows presenting this second reversible behaviour as suitable for palaeointensity

determination experiments.

In order to complement this thermomagnetic investigation, we observed thin sections from

each k-T curve type using an oil immersion objective. Fig. 3a and 3b show photomicro-

graphs in natural light of sample 269b (ﬂow Tou2), which displayed irreversible behaviour.

We saw an isotropic phase sometimes associated with a pleochroic ilmenite, as illustrated

here. Because titanomagnetite and titanomaghemite are diﬃcult to distinguish under the

microscope, it is hard to conclude about the nature of the isotropic phase. These two miner-

als are certainly both present, but the existence of cracks almost omnipresent in this phase

suggest a larger amount of titanomaghemite. This interpretation agrees well with the ir-

reversible k-T curve. Fig. 3c and 3d show two minerals from a thermally stable sample

(234c, ﬂow Tem16). They illustrate two diﬀerent advanced stages of deuteric oxidation with

Absolute palaeointensity from the Kerguelen Archipelago

7

ilmenite or titanohematite lamellae exsolved from a residual titanomagnetite almost entirely

altered. Again this observation conﬁrms the interpretation of the k-T curves.

3.3 Pilot analysis

We kept only ﬂows for which at least three samples from diﬀerent cores ﬁt all the previ-

ously enumerated criteria for the palaeointensity experiments (32 out of the initial 57). We

performed a pilot analysis with one or two samples from each of these ﬂows in order to iden-

tify the most favorable ﬂows for reliable determinations and to deﬁne the more appropriate

demagnetization steps for the next series. After applying a posteriori criteria which will be

presented later, 5 ﬂows from the Mont des Ruches section, 9 from the Mont des Tempˆetes

section and 1 from the Mont de la Rabouill`ere section seemed suitable. Because a sample

which did not pass all the a priori selection criteria may sometimes furnish a reliable deter-

mination (Coe, 1967b; Perrin, 1998), they should be regarded as serving only for selecting

the most appropriate ﬂows for palaeointensity determination. For this reason, the remaining

samples from the suitable ﬂows underscored by the pilot analysis have been incorporated in

the following two determination series (68 specimens), including the samples which did not

pass all the a priori criteria ﬁrst.

4 PALAEOINTENSITY EXPERIMENTS

4.1 Experimental procedure

We used the method of Thellier & Thellier (1959) in its classical form to estimate the

palaeointensity of the geomagnetic ﬁeld. We also followed a sliding pTRM checks pro-

cedure (Pr´evot et al., 1985) every two demagnetization steps in order to verify that the

pTRM capacity remains unaltered when the heating temperature is progressively increased.

Because of the nonlinearity of acquisition of TRM in multidomain grains (Levi, 1977), ap-

plying a laboratory ﬁeld far from the recorded one may lead to underestimate the ancient

ﬁeld (Coe, 1967b; Tanaka & Kono, 1984). Thus, to improve the quality of data, we took

care to apply, along the vertical axis of the samples, a constant ﬁeld of 50 µT (known with a

8 G. Plenier, P. Camps, R.S. Coe and M. Perrin

precision of 0.1 µT), which corresponds approximately to the strength of the mean Oligocene

ﬁeld for Kerguelen latitude. We also carried out the heating-cooling cycles under a vacuum

better than 10−4 mbar to limit possible oxidation during experiments. We performed demag-

netizations up to 580◦C, with 13 steps ranging from 50 to 10◦C, using a home made furnace

(temperature reproduced within 2◦C) in the palaeomagnetic laboratory of the University of

Montpellier. Before the treatment, and after each heating-cooling cycle, we measured the

remanence with a JR5-A spinner magnetometer. To ensure the reproducibility of the pro-

cedure at the same demagnetization step (pair of heating-cooling cycles and pTRM check),

we always kept the specimens in the same place in the oven.

4.2 Preliminary selection of palaeointensity data

Because the interpretation of palaeointensity experiments is subjective, as many other data

interpretations, a posteriori criteria help to ensure the technical quality and objectivity of

the results and their comparison from study to study. It is noteworthy to point out that

except the number of data used for each individual determination, which has been ﬁxed

to four consecutive points, the other a posteriori criteria were not used directly to reject a

determination. When only one or two a posteriori criteria failed, we kept the determination

choosing the nearest temperature interval for which the corresponding criteria stay as close

as possible from the exclusion bounds ﬁxed. The data with more than three independent

criteria unfulﬁlled have been considered as unable to furnish a reliable palaeointensity esti-

mate and thus have been excluded.

(i) f criterion: A classical way of representing palaeointensity data is to use the Arai

diagram (Arai, 1963; Nagata et al., 1963) in which the NRMT remaining at each tempera-

ture step T is plotted against the pTRMT acquired in the laboratory ﬁeld from T to room

temperature. The slope of the least squares ﬁt line computed from the linear part of the

NRM-pTRM diagram gives an estimate of the palaeoﬁeld strength. Thus criteria have to

be deﬁned to constrain the determination of this best ﬁt line and to quantify its technical

Absolute palaeointensity from the Kerguelen Archipelago

9

quality.

We already ﬁxed the minimum number of successive points used for the determinations to

four. The other criteria used is the NRM fraction f given by the ratio of the NRM lost over

the selected temperature interval to the total NRM (Coe et al., 1978). We consider that a

value of 0.3 is the minimum NRM fraction for acceptable determination. Note that a quality

factor q (Coe et al., 1978; Pr´evot et al., 1985) less than 5 can also indicate a determination

of the palaeoﬁeld strength of poor quality. However, because q is not independent of f , this

lead to reject the same samples in this study. Thus we did not use it as a rejection criterion.

(ii) Control on vector endpoint diagrams (Zijderveld’s plot): Because a straight line in

the Arai plot can involve more than one component, we checked their existence on the

Zijderveld’s projection of the NRM demagnetization computed from the palaeointensity ex-

periments. To complete this qualitative approach, we quantiﬁed the dispersion of the points

regarding to the best ﬁt line by the maximum angular deviation (MAD) (Kirschvink, 1980)

and chose a maximum value of 10◦ for this criterion.

Another quality criterion is given by the angle α between the best ﬁt line (anchored to the

center of mass) and the vector average (anchored to the origin) of the selected data in the

Zijderveld plot. If the data correspond to the primary remanence, α should be inferior to

say 10◦, in the opposite, they are certainly biased by a spurious unknown component.

(iii) z ratio: The heating remanent magnetizations (HRM) (Calvo et al., 2002) acquired

during the heating procedure under the application of a constant weak ﬁeld in palaeointen-

sity experiments, lead to erroneous data. Hopefully, the direction along which the laboratory

ﬁeld was applied corresponds to the axis of our cylindrical samples (Z axis). Therefore, in

a Zijderveld plot in sample coordinates, the acquisition of HRM appears as a progressive

deviation of the demagnetization curve in the vertical plane towards the vertical axis direc-

tion. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 in which we compare the Zijderveld’s plot inferred from

the palaeointensity experiment for a rejected sample with the demagnetization curve of its

10 G. Plenier, P. Camps, R.S. Coe and M. Perrin

sister specimen obtained during the palaeodirection analysis.

An ”HRM check” is allowed using the ratio (Goguitchaichvili et al., 1999a):

z =

HRMT
NRMT

× 100%

(1)

where HRMT and NRMT are the HRM created in the sample and the NRM left in the

ChRM direction, at a given temperature T, respectively. Similar ratios exist (e.g. R or

R’ (Coe et al., 1984)) but the z ratio allows to monitor the evolution of alterations during

treatment. Calculating this ratio supposes that one knows the ChRM direction, which re-

quires demagnetization of a sister specimen before the palaeointensity experiment.

To help the interpretation, we deﬁned the upper limit of the accepted temperature interval

as the one preceding a z >20%. However, we extended the interval over this limit when the

ratio NRM left/TRM gained did not change in the new interval. In this case some magneto-

chemical transformations are present but do not change the estimate. A limitation of the

z ratio is that it depends on the angle between the ChRM and the applied ﬁeld direction

(direction of the HRM). The more this angle tends to 90◦, the bigger is the deviation. Un-

fortunately, the tray we used to place the specimens in the oven did not permit us to orient

their ChRM at 90◦ to the applied ﬁeld. Hence, the z we calculated is a minimum value,

thus these steps had to be rejected. Another limitation of this criterion is that some unex-

pected ﬂuctuations may appear at high temperature when the NRM left is too small. For

this reason, we completed this approach by observing the evolution of the demagnetization

on an equal area projection. In Fig. 4, the z-T curve of a rejected sample 163E (Tem06) is

compared to the one obtained from an accepted sample (213E, ﬂow Tem13).

(iv) Diﬀerence ratio (DRAT): We performed sliding pTRM checks in order to estimate

the temperature at which alteration of the magnetic minerals begins. Commonly, many

authors consider that repeated pTRM acquisition at the same temperature steps should

agree to within 15% (Goguitchaichvili et al., 1999b). However, pTRMs acquired within low-

temperature interval, are rather small and thus a reproducibility within a given percentage is

diﬃcult to obtain. Therefore, we used the diﬀerence ratio (DRAT) (Selkin & Tauxe, 2000),

which normalizes the maximum diﬀerence between repeated pTRM steps performed on the

Absolute palaeointensity from the Kerguelen Archipelago

11

temperature interval selected for the determination by the length of the corresponding NRM-

pTRM segment. We ﬁxed a maximum acceptable value of 10% for this criterion. However,

this ratio reveals possible alterations on the estimate interval only, whereas physical and

chemical alterations of the heated samples can appear as soon as the ﬁrst demagnetiza-

tion steps (Kosterov & Pr´evot, 1998). Therefore, we also monitored the lower temperature

pTRM checks by determining the DRAT from ambient to maximum temperature of the

interval used to estimate the palaeointensity. It is noteworthy that the sample 163E (Fig. 4),

rejected because of its z ratio, has a DRAT of only 3%. Also ﬁve samples which give an esti-

mate in Table 4 possess a DRAT >10%, thus these two alteration criteria are complementary.

(v) High temperature pTRM-tail test: Unfortunately, 56% of the samples present a more

or less pronounced curvature in their NRM-TRM diagrams and some specimens provide two

acceptable estimates regarding the selection criteria. Because independence and additivity

laws of pTRM (Thellier, 1938) are violated for MD but maybe also for PSD grains, the

determination of the domain structure could be a relevant tool to choose between the two

acceptable palaeointensity estimates.

In case of thermally stable samples, we used the thermomagnetic criterion that was ﬁrst

introduced by Bol’shakov & Shcherbakova (1979) to get insight on the domain structure of

ferrimagnetics. We calculated the parameter AHT which is illustrated in Fig. 5 and deﬁned

by:

AHT(T1, T2) =

tailHT[pTRM(T1, T2)]
pTRM(T1, T2)

× 100%

(2)

where pTRM(T1, T2) is the pTRM measured at room temperature gained between T1 and

T2 (T1 < T2) during cooling from the Curie temperature (Tc) in a 100µT ﬁeld, and the

tailHT[pTRM(T1, T2)] is the part of this pTRM not demagnetized when the sample is sub-

sequently heated again to T1 and cooled down is zero ﬁeld. According to the criteria deﬁned

by Shcherbakova et al. (2000) for AHT(T1, T2) <4%, the remanent carrier are predominantly

SD grains, for 4% <AHT(T1, T2) <(15-20)%, they behave as pseudo-single domain (PSD)

grains, and for AHT(T1, T2) >20% they are predominantly MD grains.

12 G. Plenier, P. Camps, R.S. Coe and M. Perrin

We measured the coeﬃcients AHT(T1, T2) at increasing temperature intervals for one ther-

mally stable sample per ﬂow in order to determine the best temperature interval to estimate

the paleointensity. Because the heatings were performed in air, we repeated the determina-

tion of the coeﬃcient AHT(300, Troom) two times, at the beginning and at the end of the

treatment, in order to monitor alterations appearing during the successive heatings. Unfor-

tunately, the vibrating thermal magnetometer (VTM) we used broke before we could mea-

sure all the representative samples of each selected ﬂow. The results available are reported

in Table 2. Even though all the ﬂows have not been studied, the global trend observed

conﬁrms that with increasing temperature, the magnetic carrier behaviour is more SD-

like (Carvallo et al., 2003; Shcherbakova et al., 2000). Thus, when two coexisting palaeoin-

tensity estimates remain possible (5 samples), the high temperature pTRM-tail test favors

acceptance of the higher temperature interval determination, as for sample 187E shown in

Fig. 6.

(vi) Low temperature pTRM-tail test: According to Fabian (2001), the pTRM tail is not a

direct measure for a sample’s tendency to yield a curved Arai plot. The common concave-up

shape of MD Arai diagrams is rather well accounted for by the low temperature tail (Low-T

tail) of each pTRM segment acquired during cooling from Tc (pTRMLT(T1, T2)). This Low-

T tail is due to the grains with unblocking temperature less than blocking temperature. In

order to compare the results obtained from the two tail tests and validate the choice of the

temperature intervals for the interpretation, we decided to evaluate the Low-T tail of some

characteristic samples used during the palaeointensity experiment. We deﬁne the coeﬃcient:

ALT(T1, T2) =

tailLT[pTRM(T1, T2)]
pTRM(T1, T2)

× 100%

(3)

where pTRM(T1, T2) is the pTRM measured at room temperature gained between T1 and T2

(T1 < T2) in a 50µT ﬁeld during cooling from the Curie temperature and tailLT[pTRM(T1, T2)]

is the part of this pTRM removed when the sample is subsequently heated to T2 and cooled

down in zero ﬁeld (Fig. 5). This coeﬃcient is analogous to the AHT coeﬃcient deﬁned by

Shcherbakov et al. (2001) but the relation between the magnitude of the two tails is not clear.

Absolute palaeointensity from the Kerguelen Archipelago

13

We can expect from Dunlop & ¨Ozdemir (2001) that ALT is equal to AHT because the un-

blocking temperature distributions are almost symmetric for a given blocking temperature,

but this may be quite diﬀerent for hundred-degree temperature intervals. In the absence of

a quantitative study, only the evolution of the ALT ratio for increasing temperature intervals

will be considered.

The ALT coeﬃcients for the (450,350) and (550,450) temperature intervals are reported in

Table 3. The main result is that ALT(550, 450) is always smaller than ALT(450, 350); thus

the Low-T tail test again favors the higher temperature interval in case of two acceptable

determinations. In order to estimate the alteration which may occur during the required pre-

liminary heating up to Tc, the untreated samples 187D and 201C have been incorporated in

the experiment. Comparing their results with the data from the corresponding sister samples

187E and 201E, we can observe that, even though these samples appear thermally stable

(reversible k-T curves), ALT(450, 350) is greater for the sample used in the palaeointensity

estimate and on the contrary ALT(550, 450) is greater for the ”virgin” sample. Nonetheless,

for the ﬁve samples that allowed two acceptable interpretations, we choose the higher tem-

perature interval, which yields determination more coherent with the other samples from

the same ﬂow.

4.3 Palaeointensity results

Out of the 402 samples from the Mont des Ruches, Mont des Tempˆetes, and Mont Rabouill`ere

sections, 102 have been chosen using a priori criteria. After selection following a posteriori

criteria, 49 samples furnish a technically acceptable determination (Table 4).

The quality factor q varies from 1.6 to 54.3 with a mean value of 12.1 for estimates made

on a mean of 7 points. However, some α angles are relatively large, which could be due to

an overprint of viscous origin, even though the samples are not strongly viscous, or to a

secondary component acquired during the treatment, as shown by the angle β between the

ChRMs of the sample and its sister specimen. Although secondary HRM exists, we consider

its eﬀect negligible on the determination, considering the z criterion, the linearity of the Arai

14 G. Plenier, P. Camps, R.S. Coe and M. Perrin

diagram and the evolution of the demagnetization in an equal area projection. Therefore,

as evidenced by the MAD, which is the most widely satisﬁed a posteriori criterion, we are

conﬁdent about these interpretations. Moreover, as is commonly done in palaeointensity

studies, we distinguished two types of determination: class A for the samples which passed

successfully all the criteria and class B for those in which one to three criteria were unfulﬁlled.

However, as observed with ﬂows Rab12 or Tem6, there is no single relation between the

ﬁeld estimate and its classiﬁcation. Thus, the interpretations made with a few unsatisﬁed

a posteriori criteria can be also considered as reliable. Fig. 7 shows some characteristic

examples of palaeointensity determinations.

We present, in Table 4, the mean palaeoﬁeld strength with its associated standard deviation

for each individual ﬂow. Three consecutive Mont des Ruches ﬂows (Ruc14, 15, and 16) yield

a well deﬁned palaeointensity in the range 35-40 µT. This value is comparable with the

only reliable ﬂow from the Mont Rabouill`ere section (Rab12) and with the ﬂows Tem13 and

Tem15 from the Mont des Tempˆetes. For this last section we also observe three signiﬁcantly

higher values around 50-60 µT (Tem1,17 and 18) and two well deﬁned lower ﬁeld strengths

of only 20.1 and 25.0±1.7 µT (Tem6 and 10). Because, the within ﬂow standard deviation

represent at the maximum 15% of the palaeointensity value (ﬂow Tem13), we are quite

conﬁdent about the reliability of these estimations.

We performed in a previous study (Plenier et al., 2002), a quantitative bootstrap test for

a common mean on successive magnetic directions in order to identify non-independent

records. We concluded in particular that the Ruc14 and Ruc15 ﬂows may represent two

contemporaneous records of the palaeoﬁeld (Table 1). The palaeointensity estimates obtained

for these two successive ﬂows overlap within their uncertainties and thus strengthen our

former interpretation. However, because the palaeomagnetic ﬁeld may remain constant for

a relatively long time (Love, 2000) we will nevertheless consider in the present study each

of the 12 reliable palaeointensity estimates as distinct records.

Concerning the samples 101F, 111F, 201E, 160E, 161F and 229C, for which pTRM-tail tests

were performed, we decided to keep the lower rather than the higher temperature interval

estimates because the latter was sometimes impossible to deﬁne owing to alteration of the

pTRM blocking temperature spectra (101F, 160E, 201E and 229C) or meaningless compared

to the other determinations from the same ﬂow (111F, 161F).

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 Toward an improvement of palaeointensity determination

Because of the strict conditions imposed by the commonly used palaeointensity determina-

tion method of Thellier & Thellier (1959), numerous checks are needed to ensure reliable

estimates. For this reason, palaeointensity experiments are time consuming and at the end

many samples do not furnish reliable determinations. Consequently, the number of reliable

estimates is very low and studies dealing with palaeointensity determinations are relatively

rare. Then, eﬀective selection followed by careful palaeointensity determination method are

desirable to increase the productivity of the experiments and largely implement the number

of palaeointensity estimates in the databases.

However, no ideal selection criteria exist to select suitable specimens and ﬂows for palaeoin-

tensity experiments. For example, Sherbakov et al. (2001) proposed to use a pTRM-tail

check as a systematic procedure before the experiments to discriminate the samples with

MD grains. The few determinations of the low and high temperature pTRM-tail performed

in the present study are not convincing since many samples yielding a paleointensity estimate

with good technical quality (Table 4) will not have been kept if we followed Shcherbakov et

al.’s (2001) recommendation. Thus, we do not recommend to use the thermomagnetic crite-

rion for selection but rather in a case to case basis to deﬁne the best temperature interval

for thermally stable specimens exhibiting two slopes in the NRM/TRM diagram. For the

selection based on k-T curve shapes, the temperature intervals used for the estimates (c.f.

Table 4) can change at the ﬂow scale (ﬂow Tem13 or Tem15) without important deviation

in the palaeoﬁeld strength. Therefore, the thermal behaviour of the samples varies within a

ﬂow and this criterion applied to a supposedly representative sample is not totally eﬀective.

A study of each successful sample, at the end of the palaeoﬁeld strength determination pro-

16 G. Plenier, P. Camps, R.S. Coe and M. Perrin

cedure, up to the maximum temperature reached for the palaeointensity estimate would be

more interesting. Whatever the numerous a priori precautions we took in this study, only

48% of the selected samples gave a reliable estimate. Thus, in the absence of relevant a priori

criteria, it is preferable to reduce the preliminary experiments to the determination of the

viscosity index, which is an already rapid and reliable way to discriminate the specimens

disturbed by a viscous secondary component, followed by a directional analysis, needed for

careful palaeointensity estimates and giving enough information to discard possibly prob-

lematic ﬂows because of large NRM scatter, poor technical quality of demagnetization curves

and so on.

As regard to the determination procedure itself, some modiﬁcations of the Thellier’s method

have been proposed recently (Calvo et al., 2002; Riisager & Riisager, 2001). They include

an additional heating at each demagnetization step in order to control the HRM creation

and/or a “pTRM tail check”. However, the lack of suitable selection criteria lead to more

failure of the palaeointensity experiment and these more time consuming procedures are

consequently not helpful for systematic studies. Orienting the samples so that their ChRM

is perpendicular to the direction of the applied ﬁeld is less time consuming and suﬃcient

to check for possible HRM creation. Likewise, at the end of the treatment, complementary

experiments like k-T curve shape determination, extended Thellier’s method (Fabian, 2001)

for thermally stable samples or ”pTRM tail checks” can be performed to ensure the qual-

ity and sharpen the reliable estimates, but such supplementary processes must concern the

acceptable samples only. Thus, good determinations do not necessarily need supplementary

heatings nor burdensome procedures to be performed; this should be limited only to the

problematic samples. Reducing the selection and placing the control procedures at the end

of the treatment is thus a way to perform reliable palaeointensity estimates more quickly,

without lowering the quality of the determinations.

5.2 Comparison with previous palaeointensity results

Five Oligocene ﬂows from the Ile Haute section (49.4◦S, 69.9◦E) have been processed for

palaeointensity study (Derder et al., 1990). Of the 24 samples analyzed, 11 yielded a deter-

mination, but only one ﬂow provided more than three estimates of the palaeoﬁeld strength.

Moreover, the uncertainty of the mean palaeointensity is equal to 36% and consequently,

these data cannot be considered as reliable. The 12 distinct mean ﬂow estimates presented in

this paper are thus the only reliable determinations available for the Kerguelen Archipelago.

However, data well distributed on the Earth’s surface are needed to provide a correct idea

of the palaeomagnetic ﬁeld behaviour. It is then important to pool the Oligocene Kerguelen

results with other reliable determinations already achieved. For this aim, we used the up-

dated IAGA 2002 palaeointensity database available at the following address:

ftp://ftp.dstu.univ-montp2.fr/pub/paleointdb/

This database presents estimates obtained with diﬀerent quality determinations. However,

inclusion of lower quality data leads to higher average values of the geomagnetic ﬁeld

(Juarez & Tauxe, 2000; Goguitchaichvili et al., 1999b), thus a selection using identical cri-

teria to those used in this study is needed before we can combine them meaningfully with

the Kerguelen results. For this reason we discarded estimates based on intermediate polar-

ity ﬂows, obtained with other methods than the Thellier & Thellier’s

(1959) associated

with pTRM checks, presenting less than 3 individual samples from the same unit (except

for basaltic submarine glasses) and a standard deviation of the mean ≥20%. Application of

these drastic selection criteria led to the rejection of 660 determinations out of the 910 esti-

mates contained in the database between 0.3 and 50 Ma (Fig. 8a). Then we sharpened the

selection to a time window between 20 and 40 Ma, which resulted in 11 suitable estimates

among the 74 initial extended Oligocene records of the data base (Fig. 8a).

In order to compare the Kerguelen determinations with the selected estimates issued from

various locations and recording diﬀerent time, we calculated the virtual dipole moment

(VDM) given by:

18 G. Plenier, P. Camps, R.S. Coe and M. Perrin

VDM =

Fancient(1 + 3 cos2 θ)−1/2

4πR3
µ0

(4)

which corresponds to the moment of a dipole ﬁeld producing the estimated palaeointensity

Fancient at the magnetic colatitude θ. R is the Earth radius. Results of the calculations are

reported in Table 4 and the 12 suitable determinations are plotted in Fig. 8.

Even though we performed careful estimates in order to avoid any possible MD eﬀects in

the interpretations, which could lead to systematic higher determinations, the arithmetic

mean obtained with the Kerguelen data, 6.15±2.1 1022Am2, is deﬁnitely higher than the

other Oligocene estimates already achieved (Goguitchaichvili et al., 2001; Riisager, 1999;

Juarez et al., 1998). Including Kerguelen determinations leads to an increase of the Oligocene

mean VDM from 4.1±0.5 to 5.4±2.3 1022Am2. The new Oligocene mean VDM is closer to

the mean VDM estimated for the 0.3 and 5 Ma interval (Juarez & Tauxe, 2000) and higher

than the mean VDM deﬁned between 0.3 and 300 Ma (Fig. 8). Thus these selected Oligocene

estimates favor a relatively stable ﬁeld between 0.3 and 40 Ma and reinforce the idea of an

exceptionally high recent geomagnetic ﬁeld strength. However, the lack of good palaeoin-

tensity data didn’t allow us to go further in our interpretation. As illustrated in Fig. 8c,

the Oligocene data do not uniformly cover the Earth’s surface even though the Kerguelen

results equalize the number of estimates available for each hemisphere. More reliable deter-

minations are needed to better constrain the evolution of the palaeoﬁeld with geological time.

It is important to note that the Kerguelen results represent half of the reliable palaeointen-

sity estimates available for the Oligocene, which could lead to a bias towards higher values.

Moreover, only 3 extended Oligocene determinations are from normal polarity ﬂows. Thus

even if the 12 new estimates are supposed to be independent, the Oligocene palaeomagnetic

ﬁeld may not be suﬃciently time-averaged.

6 CONCLUSION

We carried out a palaeointensity study on three Oligocene (28-30 Ma) volcanic sections

from the Kerguelen Archipelago (southern Indian Ocean). It complements the palaeosecular

Absolute palaeointensity from the Kerguelen Archipelago

19

variation directional study already achieved on the same sections: Mont des Ruches, Mont

des Tempˆetes, and Mont Rabouill`ere (Plenier et al., 2002). Out of the 57 studied units,

we considered 32 suitable for palaeoﬁeld strength determination experiments when at least

three of their samples pass the following selection criteria: angle between NRM and ChRM

≤ 15◦ (or secondary component quickly demagnetized), NRM dispersion not too large, vis-

cosity index <5 %, stable susceptibility at room temperature after each demagnetization

step of a sister sample and reversible susceptibility in temperature curves. After preliminary

experiments, we studied all samples from 12 favorable ﬂows. We considered only the deter-

minations made with at least 4 successive steps, a z ratio (Goguitchaichvili et al., 1999a)

≤ 20%, a DRAT (Selkin & Tauxe, 2000) ≤ 10%, f factors (Coe et al., 1978) ≥ 0.3, a MAD

≤ 10◦ (Kirschvink, 1980) and an angle α between the best ﬁt line and the vector average

≤ 10◦ to be of good technical quality. In cases of two acceptable estimates, pTRM tail

tests were used to choose the temperature interval corresponding to the more SD like be-

haviour. This careful interpretation of the data leads to 49 reliable estimates. The VDMs

calculated for the 12 ﬂows vary from 2.78 to 9.47 with an arithmetic mean value of 6.15±2.1

1022Am2. This study gives the ﬁrst reliable palaeointensity estimates from the Kerguelen

Archipelago and signiﬁcantly increases the number of Oligocene data of comparable qual-

ity. The new Oligocene mean VDM calculated, 5.4±2.3 1022Am2, is very close to the 0.3-5

Ma value of Juarez & Tauxe (2000) (5.5±2.4 1022Am2), and suggests little evolution of the

geomagnetic ﬁeld between 0.3 and at least 40 Ma. Thus the present moment of the ﬁeld (8

1022Am2) is conﬁrmed to be exceptionally high. However, the lack of reliable data limits the

interpretation and we discuss practical solutions to speed the selection of suitable samples

for careful determination procedures in order to facilitate systematic studies and increase

existing palaeointensity databases with high-quality estimates.

AHT values are the relative intensities measured at room temperature of the high temperature

pTRM-tail expressed in percent A(T1, T2) = tail[pTRM(T1, T2)]/pTRM(T1, T2). B values shown

in parentheses correspond to the percent of the total pTRM (e.g., Pi pTRMi) each pTRM(T1,T2)
represents; nd means not determined. ∗ is a pTRM-tail test (300-Troom) repeated at the end of the

treatment to control the thermal stability of the sample. For AHT(T1, T2) <4%, the remanent carriers

are predominantly SD grains, for 4% <AHT(T1, T2) <(15-20)%, they present a PSD behaviour, and

for AHT(T1, T2) >20% they are predominantly MD grains.

Figure 5. Continuous thermal demagnetization of pTRM(T1,T2). The low-temperature pTRM-

tail for PSD (A) or MD (B) grains corresponds to the part of pTRM(T1,T2) removed at T2, while

the high-temperature pTRM-tail corresponds to the part of this pTRM unremoved at T1, (C) for

MD and (D) for PSD grains. The low and high-temperature pTRM-tails are measured at room

temperature.

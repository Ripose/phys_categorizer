Abstract

We present the results derived from measuring fundamental parameters
of the ionospheric response to the August 11, 1999 total solar eclipse. Our
study is based on using the data from about 70 GPS stations located in
the neighbourhood of the eclipse totality phase in Europe. The eclipse
period was characterized by a low level of geomagnetic disturbance (Dst-
variation from -10 to -20 nT), which alleviated signiﬁcantly the problem of
detecting the ionospheric response to the eclipse. Our analysis revealed a
well-deﬁned eﬀect of a decrease (depression) of the total electron content
(TEC) for all GPS stations. The delay between minimum TEC values with
respect to the totality phase near the eclipse path increased gradually from
4 min in Greenwich longitude (10:40 UT, LT) to 8 min at the longitude
16◦ (12:09 LT). The depth and duration of the TEC depression were found
to be 0.2-0.3 TECU and 60 min, respectively. The results obtained in this
study are in good agreement with earlier measurements and theoretical
estimates.

1 Introduction

Experimental observations of the ionosphere at the time of solar eclipses provide
the source of information about the character of behavior of the various iono-
spheric parameters. Regular ionospheric eﬀects of solar eclipses are fairly well
understood. They imply an increase of eﬀective reﬂection heights, a reduction in
concentration in the F-layer maximum, and a decrease in total electron content

1

(TEC) in the ionosphere, which is typical of the transition to the nightside iono-
sphere (Cohen, 1984). The behavior of the above parameters can be modeled
using appropriate ionospheric models (Stubbe, 1970; Boitman et al., 2000).

The main parameters of the ionospheric response are the value of the delay τ
with respect to the eclipse totality phase, as well as its amplitude A and duration
∆T . Almost all publications devoted to the study of the ionospheric response
to solar eclipses present estimates of these parameters. A knowledge of these
values makes it possible to reﬁne, in terms of the respective aeronomic ionospheric
models, the time constants of ionization and recombination processes at diﬀerent
heights in the ionopshere.

The measurements of τ were made by analyzing the characteristics of the
ionosphere-reﬂected radio signal at vertical-incidence soundings at a network of
ionospheric stations (Marriott et al., 1969; Goncharov et al., 1982; Boitman et
al., 2000) by measuring the frequency Doppler shift at vertical- and oblique-
incidence soundings (Boitman et al., 2000). In the cited references, the value of
τ was found to vary from 0 (Marriott et al., 1969) to 20 min, with the amplitude
A of a decrease in local electron density of order 9 × 104 cm−3, and the response
duration of about 1 hour (Boitman et al., 2000).

Similar measurements at an ionospheric station were made during the solar
eclipse of September 23, 1987 in the south-eastern Asia (Cheng, 1992). The am-
plitude, delay and duration of the ionospheric response were found to be 0.3 ×106
cm−3, 18 min and 1 hour 30 min, respectively. At the same time, measurements
during the eclipse of October 24, 1995 in the same region provided an estimate of
τ of about 80 min (Huang, 1999), ∆T = 1 hour 20 min, and A in excess of 1 ×106
cm−3. The measurements of f0F 2 over the Scaramanga station during a partial
solar eclipse of May 20, 1996 (Anastassiadis, 1970) give the value of τ of about
38 min. In paper Zherebtsov et al. (1998a), the delay time of the ionospheric
response to the eclipse was between 25 and 30 min (at 300 km altitude).

Interesting results were obtained in observations of an annular solar eclipse
of May 30, 1984 at the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar (Salah, 1986). A
decrease in electron density with respect to the eclipse totality phase occurred
in this case 20–30 min later, with A = 4 × 106cm−3, and ∆T = 2 hours 15 min.
However, facilities of this kind are too few to be extensively used in experiments
during solar eclipses.

The ionospheric response to the March 9, 1997 total solar eclipse was inves-
tigated using a network of ionosondes (Zherebtsov et al., 1998b). For this event,
the position of the minimum of the trough in the time dependence of electron
density was shifted with respect to the time of maximum occultation of the solar
disk by 10–15 min, with A = 1 × 105 cm−3, ∆T = 1 hour 15 min.

A large amount of data was obtained by measuring the Faraday rotation of the
plane of polarization of VHF signals of geostationary satellites (Klobuchar et al.,
1970; Hunter et al., 1974; Davies,1980; Rama Rao, 1982; Essex, 1982; Deshpande,
1982; Singh, 1989). These measurements revealed the eclipse-induced eﬀect of

2

a deep depression (decrease) in TEC with the amplitude A varying from 2 to
14 TECU, and with a typical time of TEC depression and recovery of about
several hours (the unit of measurement of TEC that is adopted in the literature
corresponds to 1016 −2). The spread in the values of τ was also found to vary
over a wide range, from 5 to 40 min.

According to Klobuchar et al. (1970), for a total solar eclipse that occurred
in spring (March 7, 1970), the amplitude A was 11 TECU, ∆T = 2 hours 44
min, and τ of order 33 min. For the total solar eclipse of February 16, 1980,
the observations at Waltair (Singh, 1989) gave the following estimates: A =
0.11 TECU, ∆T = 1 hour, and τ = 20 min. Essex et al. (1982) inferred that for
the total solar eclipse of February 20, 1979, the values of A and τ are 14 TECU
and 33 min, respectively.

Hence a large body of experimental data do not permit us to make any re-
liable estimates of the basic parameters of the ionospheric response. One of the
reason for such a great diﬀerence is attributable to the use of diﬀerent methods of
measurements which diﬀer greatly by spatial and temporal resolution. However,
the main reason is caused by dissimilar characteristics of the eclipse itself, by
geophysical conditions of individual measurements, and by a large diﬀerence of
the latitude, longitude and local time when experiments are conducted.

To obtain more reliable information about the behaviour of the ionosphere
during an eclipse, it is necessary to carry out simultaneous measurements over a
large area covering regions with a diﬀerent local time. Furthermore, high spatial
(of some tens of kilometres at least) and temporal (at least 1 min) resolution is
needed. However, none of the above familiar methods meets such requirements.
The development of the global navigation system GPS and the creation, on its
basis, of extensive networks of GPS stations (which at the end of 1999 consisted
of no less than 600 sites), the data from which are placed on the INTERNET
(Klobuchar, 1997), open up a new era in remote sensing of the ionosphere. At
almost any point of the globe and at any time at two coherently-coupled fre-
quencies f1 = 1575.42 MHz and f2 = 1227.60 MHz, two-frequency multichannel
receivers of the GPS system are used to carry out high-precision measurements
of the group and phase delay along the line o sight between the ground-based
receiver and satellite-borne transmitters in the zone of reception. The sensitivity
aﬀorded by phase measurements in the GPS system permits irregularities to be
detected with an amplitude of up to 10−3–10−4 of the diurnal variation of TEC.
Afraimovich et al. (1998) were the ﬁrst to use in a detailed analysis of regular
ionopsheric eﬀects measurements of TEC and its gradients for the total solar
eclipse of March 9, 1997, using for this purpose the GPS interferometer at Irkutsk.
Their results bear witness to signiﬁcant changes occurring in the process of ion
production in the ionosphere during the solar eclipse, simultaneously in a large
volume of space with a radius of at least 300 km at 300 km altitude. The delay
of a minimum TEC value with respect to the phase of totality is about 10 min,
the depth of TEC depression varies from 1 to 3 TECU, and ∆T = 1 hour 15 min.

3

Boitman et al. (2000) obtained a good agreement of these data, as well of
measurements for several HF Doppler sounding paths with results of a numerical
simulations using the ionosphere-plasmasphere coupling model (Krinberg, 1984).
Unfortunately, during this eclipse the total shadow’s path in 1997 was monitored
by only few GPS stations; therefore, it was not possible to determine the spatial-
temporal characteristics of the ionopsheric response.

According to the data from ﬁve GPS stations reported by Tsai and Liu (1999)
for the solar eclipses of October 24, 1995 and March 9, 1997, the delay τ varied
over a broad range, from 0 to 30 min, the amplitude A was close to 7 TECU, and
∆T varied from 40 min to 1 hour.

A unique opportunity to exploit the potential of the GPS network was pro-
vided by the total solar eclipse of August 11, 1999. For this period of time, the
INTERNET made available the data from at least 100 GPS stations located in
Western and Central Europe within and near the totality path. A massive ﬂow of
publications on the various ionospheric eﬀects of this eclipse should be forthcom-
ing, based on the GPS data in conjunction with the data from other observing
facilities. The objective of this paper is to determine the basic parameters of the
ionospheric response to the August 11, 1999 total solar eclipse using these data.
General information about the eclipse, and a description of the experimen-
tal geometry are given in Section 2. The ionospheric response to the eclipse is
discussed in Section 3 using the data from reference ionospheric station Chilton.
The processing technique for the GPS network data, and results derived from
analysing the ionospheric response of the August 11, 1999 solar eclipse in Europe
are outlined in Section 4. Results obtained in this study are discussed in Section
5.

2 The geometry and general information of to-

tal solar eclipse AUGUST 11, 1999

The last solar eclipse in the 20–th century began in North Atlantic, and path of
the Moon’s shadow made ﬁrst landfall in south-western England at 10:10 UT;
the Sun at that time was at an angle of 45◦ over the eastern horizon. The centre
line duration of total eclipse averaged 2 min, and the total eclipse was conﬁned
to a narrow corridor 103 km wide.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic map of the path of the Moon’s shadow crossing
parts of Western and Central Europe (the data from Espenak, 1999 were used in
constructing this map). The centre line of eclipse at ground level is shown as a
thick line, and thin lines correspond to its southern and northern boundaries. The
location of reference ionospheric station Chilton (RAL) is marked by the symbol
⋆. Dots • and symbols + show the locations of the GPS stations used in the
analysis; their geographic coordinates are presented in Table 1. Dots •, together

4

with symbols + are used to represent a total set of GPS stations. Symbols + form
a network of GPS stations located near the eclipse path; therefore, we designated
this group as the near zone. Numbers for the longitudes 10◦W , 0◦, 10◦E, 20◦E,
30◦E, 40◦E correspond to the local time for these longitudes.

In this paper we conﬁne ourselves to analysing only to a region of Western and
Central Europe from the coast of southern England to the point with coordinates
56.03◦N, 37.2◦E, where the totality phase was observed at 11:20 UT (14:20 LT).
Thus the solar eclipse eﬀect occurred for the conditions of the daytime summer
ionosphere.

The distance along the great-circle arc between the above-mentioned extreme
points is about 2900 km, with the time diﬀerence of 67 min only. Hence a
distinguishing characteristic of this eclipse was the supersonic speed of the Moon’s
shadow sweeping through the terrestrial surface, exceeding 720 m/s.

At ionospheric heights the totality path was travelling somewhat further
south. The onset time of the totality phase for the height h=300 km over Bu-
dapest is 1.3 min ahead of that at ground level. The diﬀerence in the values of
the totality phases and their onset times is caused by the Sun’s altitude over the
horizon. At the time of the totality phase in Budapest (11:05 UT, or 14:05 LT),
it was as small as 59◦.

The period under consideration was characterized by a low level of geomag-
netic disturbance (Dst-variation from -10 to -20 nT), which simpliﬁed greatly the
problem of detecting the ionospheric response of eclipse.

3 The ionospheric response by eclipse from date

of ionospheric station Chilton

First we consider the variations of critical frequencies f0F 2 over the time interval
00:00-24:00 UT on August 11, 1999 according to the data from station Chilton
(RAL) - Fig. 2a. The onset time of the totality phase of eclipse in the area of sta-
tion Chilton (RAL) at 300 km altitude is shown by a vertical solid line. As might
be expected under the conditions of the summer ionosphere, the mean level of
f0F 2 diﬀers only slightly for the night-time and daytime. Nevertheless, a decrease
of f0F 2 during the totality phase of eclipse is suﬃciently clearly distinguished.

Consider the variations of ionospheric parameters for the time interval 06:00–
15:00 UT on August 11, 1999, and on the background days of August 10 and
12, using the data from station Chilton (RAL) - Fig. 3. Dots correspond to
variations of critical frequencies f0F 2 (panel a), f0F 1 (panel c), apparent heights
h′F (panel b), and h′F 2 (panel d) for August 11, 1999. Solid curves plot the
same values that are smoothed with a time window of 60 min. For August 10
and 12, only smoothed curves are given, with the same time window of 60 min.

5

The onset time of the totality phase of eclipse (10:16 UT) at 300 km altitude over
the station is shown by a thin vertical line.

The eclipse eﬀect is most conspicuous in the variations of critical frequencies
f0F 2, whose maximum diﬀerence from the background values on August 10 and
12 at the time of reaching a minimum (10:20 UT) was up to 2 MHz. On the
other hand, the amplitude of a decrease of f0F 2 for the August 11 event (after
the totality phase of eclipse) does not exceed 1 MHz. The eclipse eﬀect on other
parameters is not as clearly distinguished, and becomes evident only when com-
paring the smoothed curves. Similar results of measurements at an ionospheric
station were obtained during the total solar eclipse of September 23, 1987 in
South-Eastern Asia (K. Cheng, 1992).

The f0F 2 – variations, measured at station Chilton (RAL) at time intervals
of 4 min, are presented in greater detail in Fig. 4a (heavy dots). The solid curve
connecting these dots is an approximating one for these values. This panel plots
also the geometrical function of eclipse S(t) at 300 km altitude, calculated for
station Chilton. Minimum values of f0F 2 and S(t) correspond to the points A
and B in this ﬁgure. The respective delay τ between the time of a minimum of
f0F 2 and of the function S(t) is close to 4 min in this case.

The data from the station Chilton (RAL) and from GPS station HERS nearest

to it are compared in the next Section.

4 The process of GPS–network data and results
of analysis of ionospheric eﬀect by total solar
eclipse of August 11, 1999

We now give a brief account of the sequence of procedures used in processing
the GPS data. Input data are represented by series of ”oblique” values of TEC
I(t), as well as by the corresponding series of elevations θ(t) measured from the
ground, and azimuths α(t) of the line of sight to the satellite measured clockwise
from the northward direction. These parameters are calculated by our developed
CONVTEC program by converting the GPS-standard RINEX-ﬁles from the IN-
TERNET. Series of elevations θ(t) and azimuths α(t) of the line of sight to the
satellite are used to determine the location of subionospheric points. In the case
under consideration, all results were obtained for larger than 45◦ elevations θ(t).
Fig. 4c presents the experimental geometry in the area of ionospheric station
Chilton (RAL) - ⋆, and GPS station HERS (•). Heavy dots • show the centre
line of eclipse at ground level, and smaller dots correspond to its southern and
northern boundaries. The symbol ∗ shows the position of the subionospheric
point at the time of a maximum response of TEC (see below).

Various methods for reconstructing the absolute value of TEC are currently
under development using measurements of both phase and group delays; however,

6

eﬀective algorithms for an accurate solution of this problem are still unavailable
for the diﬀerent types of two-frequency receivers and operating modes of the GPS
system. In this connection, for purposes of this paper, we limit our attention to
considering only those TEC variations which were obtained from phase delay
measurements by formula (Afraimovich et al., 1998):

Ip =

1

40.308

2

f 2
1 f 2
f 2
1 − f 2

2

[(L1λ1 − L2λ2) + const + nL]

(1)

where L1λ1 and L2λ2 are additional paths of the radio signal caused by the
phase delay in the ionosphere, (m); L1 and L2 represent the number of phase
rotations at the frequencies f1 and f2; λ1 and λ2 stand for the corresponding
wavelengths, (m); const is the unknown initial phase ambiguity, (m); and nL are
errors in determining the phase path, (m).

For an approximate speciﬁcation of the TEC constant component I0 at time
intervals of 2 hours, we made use of the INTERNET data on corresponding global
maps of the absolute vertical value of TEC in the IONEX format (Mannucci,
1998) - see also Fig. 2b. To normalize the response amplitude we converted the
”oblique” TEC to an equivalent ”vertical” value:

I(t) = Ip(t)sin(θ(t))

(2)

Although, because of a strong horizontal TEC gradient and without regard
for the spericity of the problem, this procedure gives a very rough result, but this
result is quite acceptable because all our results were obtained for larger than 45◦
elevations θ(t).

With the purpose of eliminating variations of the regular ionosphere, as well as
trends introduced by the satellite’s motion, we employ the procedure of eliminat-
ing the trend by preliminarily smoothing the initial series with the time window
in the range from 40 to 100 min which is ﬁtted for each TEC sampling. Such a
procedure is also required for a clearer identiﬁcation of the ionospheric response
of eclipse which is characterized by a relatively small amplitude (see below) un-
der the presence of space-time TEC variations that are not associated with the
eclipse.

For the purposes of illustration of the data processing procedure Fig. 5
presents the ﬁltered TEC variations dI(t) for August 11 (thick line), and for
the background days of August 10 and 12, 1999 (thin lines) for station HERS
for satellite N14 (PRN 14) - c), as well as for stations ZIMM (PRN 1) - b) and
WTZT (PRN 14) - a), which are separated from station HERS, respectively, by
7◦ and 13◦ in longitude eastward. Figures correspond to GPS satellite numbers.
The onset time of the totality phase of eclipse at 300 km altitude for the cor-
responding subionospheric points is shown by vertical solid lines. As is evident
from the ﬁgure, responses to the eclipse at these stations are very similar in both
form and amplitude, but the response delay increases with the longitude. dI(t)

7

– variations for the background days of August 10 and 12, 1999 for diﬀerent sta-
tions diﬀer substantially not only from the TEC response to eclipse but also from
one another.

Fig. 4b presents the ﬁltered variations of TEC dI(t) for station HERS for
PRN 14 during August 11, 1999 (thick line). This panel plots also the geo-
metrical function of eclipse at 300 km altitude, S(t), that is calculated for the
subionospheric point of PRN 14. A minimum value of S(t) corresponds to the
point A in the ﬁgure.

As is apparent from this ﬁgure, the form of the ﬁltered variations is similar
to a triangle whose vertex (point B) corresponds to the time at which the TEC
attains its minimum value. The value of dImin itself can serve as an estimate
of the amplitude of TEC response to eclipse, and the time interval between the
times of intersection of the line dI=0 (points C and D) can serve as an estimate of
the duration of the response ∆T . The corresponding delay τ between the times
of the minimum of dImin and of the function S(t) in this case was found to be 4
min, which coincides with the estimate of τ for ionospheric station Chilton (see
Section 3). The response amplitude in this case was close to 0.18 TECU, and
the response duration was 46 min.

Such dI(t) – variations are characteristic for all GPS stations and satellite
numbers 01 and 14 listed in Table 1. The choice of the same satellites, PRN 01
and PRN 14, for the entire selected set of GPS stations was dictated by the fact
for these satellites a maximum value of the elevation θ of the line of sight to the
satellite exceeded 45◦ for the time interval 10:00-12:30 UT, which reduced to a
minimum the possible error of conversion to the ”vertical” value of TEC as a
consequence of the sphericity.

The ﬁrst line of Table 2 presents the results of a statistical processing for the
entire set of GPS stations listed in Table 1. The second line includes only those
stations whichlie in the immediate vicinity of the eclipse path, within ± 5◦ with
respect to the centre line (near zone). In Table 2, the values before the bar are
mean values, and those after the bar correspond to the standard deviation. The
mean value of τ for the entire set of stations is 16 min, while for the stations
in the near zone this value is 7 min. The mean value of the amplitude A=0.3
TECU for all stations and A=0.1 TECU for the near zone. The width of the
TEC trough for the far and near zones ∆T = 60 min, on average.

Fig. 6 presents a longitudinal dependence of the time position tmin of minima
of the curves dI(t) for subionospheric points lying in the immediate vicinity of
the eclipse band (satellites 1 and 14) - heavy dots. Dark symbols △ designate
the times of totality phases of the geometrical function of eclipse versus longitude
which are calculated for the subionospheric points. Shaded symbols ⋄ correspond
to delay times between maximum of the geometrical function of eclipse and a
minimum in TEC.

It was found that the delay τ increases gradually from 4 min at the Greenwich

longitude (10:23 UT, LT) to 16 min at the longitude of 16◦ (12:09 LT).

5 Conclusions

Our results are in good agreement with earlier measurements and theoretical
estimates (see a review of the data in the Introduction). The key feature of our
data is a higher reliability of determining the main parameters of the response to
eclipse which is due to high space-time resolution and to the increased sensitivity
of detection of ionospheric disturbances inherent in the GPS-array method which
we are using.

Also, due regard must be had to the fact that the distinctive property of
the eclipse under consideration was a relatively small response amplitude, which
required special ﬁltering of the TEC series (see preceding Section). The rea-
son is that, unlike a number of eclipses for which more-or-less reliable data were
obtained, this eclipse occurred in the summer season characterized by only mod-
erate diﬀerences of the daytime and night-time ionization. Furthermore, in this
situation the time variation of f0F 2 and vertical TEC near noon usually shows a
minimum which, in essence, masks the eclipse eﬀect (see also Fig. 2b). It is also
vital to note that the time constant of a decrease in ionization in the F2 max-
imum exceeds substantially the duration of the totality phase of eclipse, which
leads also to a decrease in response amplitude.

The local time-dependence of τ that is revealed in this paper is in agreement
with theoretical estimates reported in (Stubbe, 1970). The value of τ for foF2,
approaching 6 min, corresponded to 13:40 LT. Using modeling methods (Ivelskaya
et al., 1977) showed that the variations of the delay time τ of minimum local
electron density Ne(t) with respect to a minimum of the ion production function
are as follows: τ = 1-2 min at 150 km altitude, τ = 3 min at 200 km, τ = 20
min at 300 km, and τ = 45 min above 600 km. In this paper τ is estimated,
respectively, at about 3 min for 200 km altitude and 20 min for 300 km altitude
for 12 LT.

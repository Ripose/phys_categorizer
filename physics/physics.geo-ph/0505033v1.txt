Abstract

We ﬁnd the static displacement, strain and stress produced in an elastic medium by a ﬁnite size

rectangular fault after its dislocation with uniform stress drop but a non uniform dislocation

on the source. The time-dependent rate of triggered earthquakes is estimated by a rate-state

model applied to a uniformly distributed population of faults whose equilibrium is perturbated

by a stress change caused only by the ﬁrst dislocation. The rate of triggered events in our

simulations is exponentially proportional to the stress change, but the time at which the maxi-

mum rate begins to decrease is variable from fractions of hour for positive stress changes of the

order of some MP a, up to more than a year for smaller stress changes. As a consequence, the

ﬁnal number of triggered events is proportional to the stress change. The model predicts that

the total number of events triggered on a plane containing the fault is proportional to the 2/3

power of the seismic moment. Indeed, the total number of aftershocks produced on the fault

plane scales in magnitude as 10M . Including the negative contribution of the stress drop inside

the source, we observe that the number of events inhibited on the fault is, at long term, nearly

identical to the number of those induced outside, representing a sort of conservative natural

rule. Considering its behaviour in time, our model doesn’t completely match the popular Omori

law; in fact it has been shown that the seismicity induced closely to the fault edges is intense

but of short duration, while that expected at large distances (up to some tens times the fault

dimensions) exhibits a much slower decay.

Key Words: aftershocks, earthquake triggering, fault parameters, rate-and-state, Omori law.

Introduction

earthquake risk.

Studying the space-time interaction of earthquakes is important not only for the comprehension

of the phenomenon of earthquakes, but also for its possible application in the mitigation of

In this paper we aim to the physical modelling of the interaction between seismic events,

seeking a relationship between the source parameters of an earthquake and the rate of all other

2

earthquakes that follow it, a phenomenon empirically and variably labelled with the names of

seismic acceleration, foreshock and aftershock sequences, swarms, earthquake clustering, etc.

A purely statistical approach to this phenomenon exists with the name of ”epidemic model”

(Ogata, 1988Ogata, 1998Console et al., 2003). In the epidemic model each earthquake source

is supposed capable of increasing the probability of new earthquakes according to a kernel space

and time probability distribution decreasing from the source. The epidemic model is applicable

not only to the aftershock phenomenon but also to the foreshock’s. However, despite it provides

an accurate statistical rapresentation of earthquake interaction, the physical interpretation is

ignored.

In order to formulate a more physical description of the clustered seismicity, we consider

that seismic events modify the stress ﬁeld around the causative fault. Our main goal in this

work is to observe the spatio-temporal variation of the seismicity rate after an event intro-

ducing in the algorithm a rate-state model approach derived by Ruina (1983) and Dieterich

(Dieterich, 1986Dieterich, 1992Dieterich, 1994). We aim to create a link between a physical

modelling of the stress transfer and the epidemic model approach (see also Console et al. (2004)).

Some recent studies put in evidence that sudden stress variations, even of small magnitude, can

produce large variations of the seismicity rate. It is recognized as a phenomenon of triggering,

rather than induction, on faults that are already subject to relevant stress. The seismic rate in-

creases in general where the stress change (called Coulomb Stress Change) is positive, according

These studies were able to give a physical interpretation for earthquake interaction observed

in speciﬁc real cases, but were not suitable for the general application of the model in predic-

tive way as it is necessary for the information contained in a seismic catalog. In particular,

the Coulomb stress change criterion doesn’t allow to model the hyperbolic time decay of the

aftershock rate after a mainshock, known as the Omori Law.

In this simple model all the

next earthquakes would be advanced by a time wich depends on the stress change and on

the loading rate but doesn’t depend on the physical properties of the fault. The experience

shows that the Earth doesn’t rather behave in this way. The most popular empirical descrip-

tion of the phenomenon is the Omori law, stating that the the aftershock rate decays in time

3

to the Coulomb model (Mendoza and Hartzell, 1988Boatwright and Cocco, 1996Stein et al., 1997Gomberg et

as t−1. Among the various theories modelling the Omori law, we have taken in considera-

tion only the one that involves a particular constitutive behaviour of faults. Therefore, we

have not considered, even without rejecting them in principle, other hypotheses that predict

a time variation in stress, like the viscoelasticity and the diﬀusion of ﬂuids in the medium.

The rate-state model for earthquake nucleation seems capable of substantially explaining all

the phenomenology.

In this model slip doesn’t occur instantaneously at the exceeding of a

threshold stress as for the Coulomb-Amonton criterion, but follows a more complex time his-

tory with diﬀerent phases. This time history depends on the physical properties of the fault

too. The application of the rate-and-state model to the evolution of seismicity is not new, e.g.,

Toda et al. (1998) have used this model to predict the spatio-temporal seismicity rate after

the Kobe earthquake. Other examples of application of the same model can also be found in

the literature (Toda and Stein, 2000Toda and Stein, 2002Toda and Stein, 2003). Following the

rate-state model it has recently been possible to simulate seismicity quite realistically, account-

ing for the rate of events induced by stress changes even at large distance from the inducing

earthquake (Ziv, 2003Ziv and Rubin, 2003).

Basing our work on the classical theory of the elasticity, we start from the formulation of

the stress released by a rectangular fault with uniform stress-drop; then we apply the rate-

state model (Dieterich, 1994), to the stress distribution, obtaining the complete time and space

distribution of the seismicity induced by a given fault.

It is important to remark that for

present purposes we neglect the interaction between subsequent events, supposing that only

the ﬁrst event perturbs the stress ﬁeld. We also neglect the eﬀect of the free surface of the

Earth. In this study we limit our interest to the behaviour of induced seismicity in space and

time and its relationship with the fault’s parameters. Because of the qualitative nature of this

work we don’t use the expressions derived, in a similar but more complex context, by Okada

in 1992. The results of simulations are analysed to ﬁnd out the scaling relationships existing

between the free parameters of the model and the expected seismicity in a way that will allow

the validation of the model by real observations.

2 Elastic model for a rectangular fault

Suppose that a fault is embedded in a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic medium where the stress

tensor σ is uniform. At a particular moment, the fault slips generating an earthquake, and

suppose that the earthquake fully releases the component of the traction parallel to the slip

vector across the fault. We call ∆σ (the stress drop) the uniform negative change of traction

on the fault. It is well known that the slip distribution on a fault in similar conditions is not

uniform. The slip distribution will satisfy the theory of the elasticity at the new equilibrium,

and it will be zero on the edges of the fault. It is also well known that the shear stress on the

fault plane outside the edges of the fault increases signiﬁcantly.

The analytical solution for the slip distribution on a fault at the equilibrium doesn’t exist

except that for very simple geometries, such as a rectangular fault of constant width and inﬁnite

length (Knopoﬀ, 1957) and for a circular fault (Keilis-Borok, 1959Udas, 1999). As mentioned

by Kostrov and Das (1998), the analytical solution is not known even for a geometry as simple

as a rectangular shape of width W and length L. In the literature it is possible to ﬁnd the com-

putation of the stress ﬁeld generated by an ideal rectangular fault with uniform slip in an inﬁnite

homogeneous space or semispace (Chinnery, 1961Iwasaki and Sato, 1979Okada, 1985bOkada, 1985a).

However, as mentioned above, this is not a situation of equilibrium fulﬁlling all the physical

constraints imposed by the theory of the elasticity. For this reason, here we make use of a

non uniform slip distribution that is approximatively compatible with a uniform stress drop

on the fault. The theoretical approach of this work has been made as simple as possible, still

preserving the capability of modeling the stress transfer from seismic source to another.

To calculate the static displacement, stress and strain, we start from the components i of

the static displacement vector uj

i (x) produced by an elementary force directed as the j axis in

any point of an inﬁnite, elastic, homogeneous and isotropic medium, known as the Somigliana

Tensor. From the expressions valid for a single force source, those for a couple of forces of given

moment are derived by diﬀerentiation with respect to the direction of the arm of the couple of

forces. Then the expressions for a source represented by a double couple of forces are obtained

by summing a pair of two co-planar couples orthogonal to each other. Once the expressions for

the displacement are known, the strain eij and the stress σij are computed by their deﬁnitions.

Our model of an extended source is drawn euristically from that of a rectangular fault

inﬁnitely extending in one direction and that of a circular fault, and it is characterized by a

plane whose origin is coincident with the center of the rectangle, ∆σ is the stress drop and µ the

shear modulus (rigidity) of the elastic medium. Equation (1) satisﬁes the condition of zero slip

on the edges of the rectangle. The slip distribution is of a form very similar to that obtained

numerically by discretization, except for the cases when one dimension is much larger than the

other (Kostrov and Das, 1998) . Its analytical form is similar to the solution for a circular fault.

Moreover, for a fault of square shape (W = L) it achieves a seismic moment consistent with

those obtained analitically for two circular faults, respectively inscribed and circumscribed to

the square. Bonafede and Neri (2000) have shown that, when imposing a unidirectional traction

release in the strike or dip direction, a minor component of slip is present, over the fault plane,

even in the direction perpendicular to the released traction. In consideration of the qualitative

character of this study, we have neglected this component.

For our numerical applications we discretize the continuous slip distribution of equation

(1) with a set of point sources densely distributed on the fault. The more numerous are the

point sources, the more accurate will be the approximation. Each element (p, q) of the fault is

characterized by its scalar seismic moment mpq that, by the theorem of the representation is

given by:

mpq = µ∆upqΣpq,

where ∆upq is the slip on the element (p, q) and Σpq is its elementary area.

If upq(x) is the displacement produced by the slip on the element (p, q) in the point x, the

displacement resulting from the combination of all the elements is computed by:

Figures 1 and 2 show two examples for the components of the stress ﬁeld produced by a

strike slip fault whose parameters are listed in Table 1. Note that these Figures show the stress

change ∆τ1 and not its absolute value.

Figure 1 clearly shows that the shear stress σ12 is maximum near the edges of the fault, in

particular along the slip direction x1, and decreases with increasing the distance from the fault.

Inside the fault ∆τ is negative and approximately equal to ∆σ.

3 The rate-state model

As already stated, we assume that the time-dependent behaviour of the seismicity triggered

by a stress change in a population of faults is described by the rate-state model introduced

by Ruina (1983) and Dieterich (Dieterich, 1986Dieterich, 1992Dieterich, 1994). According to

Dieterich (1994) the rate R of earthquakes due to a ∆τ stress change is given by:

whose various parameters are deﬁned in Table 2. Note that equation (7) doesn’t predict the

magnitude of the earthquakes, for the distribution of which we assume the classical Gutenberg-

Richter frequency-magnitude relationship. However, both R and r refer to the number of

earthquakes in a speciﬁc magnitude range.

The modelling of the space-time distribution of seismicity triggered by an earthquake is

straightforward, introducing the expression for the stress change in equation (7).

It should

be noted that the component of the most favorable stress variation for triggering subsequent

events is σ12, the component that rapresents the shear stress on the plane of the fault; for this

reason we introduce in ∆τ this stress variation component and not a traction. We also make

the assumption ˙τ = ˙τr. The meaning of this last assumption is that the primary earthquake

doesn’t change the long-term stress rate due to the tectonic driving forces in the environment.

It is easily understandable from (7) that the integral of R over inﬁnite time diverges. This

is due to the fact that the limit of R for t

is the background rate r. We prefer to deal with

is shown in Figure 3 (see also Dieterich (1994)). It shows that the initial value of the triggered

seismicity rate, immediately after the triggering event, is proportional to the exponential of

the stress variation but the time period over which R(t) is maximum and relatively constant

decreases exponentially by the same factor for increasing stress change. This time period,

in substantial agreement with Dieterich (1994), can be obtained computing the intersection

between R′(t = 0) and the straight line corresponding to the limit of R′ when ∆τ

. The

diﬀerence with Dieterich (1994), as Figure 4 shows, is that we have preferred to make use of

R′, rather than R, and we ignore the case ˙τ = 0 which we judge not realistic. Such time period

ranges from few hours for a variation ∆τ = 5MP a to nearly one year for ∆τ = 1MP a. Figure

3 ﬁnally shows that the total duration of the triggered seismicity is the same but the shape of

the decay is diﬀerent for diﬀerent ∆τ . The integration of R′ over inﬁnite time leads to the not

completely trivial result thet the total number of triggered events in an area of constant stress

change is proportional to ∆τ (Helmstetter et al., 2004):

This relationship predicted by the friction model had been observed for Landers Aftershocks

by Gross and Kisslinger (1997). We consider the integral over time of the triggered seismicity

rate R′, once for a positive ∆τ , and then for a negative ∆τ of the same size, and we sum the

two functions. We obtain a quantity that intially has a positive increase and then tends back

to zero (Figure 5). This result can be interpreted as a sort of conservative law of the seismicity,

by saying that the total number of aftershocks generated in a place close to a fault can be

balanced, at long range, by the total number of those events that are inhibited by the stress

drop in a place internal to the fault if the stress drops are equal in absolute value.

For numerical applications it is necessary to deﬁne the value of the various parameters

appearing in equation (7). Table 3 contains a list of values inferred from several geophysical

considerations and used in our simulations. The reference seismicity rate, r, is a quantity that

should be known experimentally for a given area, and it is related to the average strain rate ˙τ

of that area. We use for r a uniform value of four events of magnitude exceeding 3.0 per year

per 1000 km2, and for ˙τ a value of 5 KP a per year. These are simpliﬁcations of the reality

where r and ˙τ are not geographically uniform. These parameters seem however reasonable for

an area of moderate seismicity. The reason why r is expressed as a number of events per unit

area and time is given below. The parameter A of the constitutive law has a value ranging from

0.005 to 0.015 obtained from laboratory experiments (Dieterich, 1995). Generally, simulations

that most nearly resemble earthquakes in nature were obtained with rather small values of A,

near to A

0.001. The value of Aσ has been evaluated for diﬀerent sequences of earthquakes

≈

9

by several autors (Belardinelli et al., 2003Stein, 1999). The parameter σ is the normal pressure

on the fault (of the order of some tens of MP a). The characteristic time of aftershocks, ta,

depending on the other parameters through the relation ta = (Aσ)/ ˙τ , in this context is of the

order of several tens of years. This value is essential to model a long term triggered seismicity,

because the eﬀect of the stress change disappears completely after a time of the order of the

double of ta.

4 Application to a rectangular fault

Dieterich (1994) discussed in detail the case of a ﬁnite circular dislocation with uniform stress

drop.

In our simulations we have taken into consideration a vertical rectangular fault with

horizontal slip in the x1 direction, embedded in a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic medium. The

values assumed for the fault parameters are again those reported in Table 1. Assuming a con-

stant stress drop ∆σ, equation (6) shows that the scalar seismic moment M0 is proportional to

the quantity (W L)3/2, that can be considered a sort of equivalent source volume. Scaling W and

L by a given factor, M0 scales accordingly, and also the shape of the stress distribution in space

scales by the same factor. Assuming that the background seismicity rate is given as the number

of events per unit volume and time, and integrating over the space, we ﬁnd that the number of

events triggered by the earthquake is proportional to the cube of the linear dimensions, i.e. to

the seismic moment M0, or to 103/2M . In this study we make the diﬀerent hypothesis that the

aftershocks of an earthquake occur mainly on the fault plane. This hypothesis comes from the

consideration that the fault plane is subject to the maximum sheare stress and that it is a sort of

plane of weakness where the triggered seismicity is more likely to occur. In this case, the num-

2/3
ber of triggered events would be proportional to M
0

, or to 10M . If it was true, and neglecting

other kinds of factors, one earthquake of given magnitude would have a number of aftershocks

ten times larger than one earthquake of one magnitude unit smaller. Assuming, then, that the

b value of the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude relation is equal to 1, it would follow

that the earthquakes of a magnitude class produce the same number of aftershocks as the earth-

quakes of the magnitude class one unit smaller. This hypothesis is supported by the statistical

analysis of real observations (Felzer et al., 2001Yamanaka and Shimazaki, 1990Utsu, 1969) and

10

will be used in the following of the paper.

A ﬁrst group of simulations concerning the seismicity triggered by a fault as a whole have

been performed to study the variation of the total number of triggered events (in space and

time), Ntot, versus the main free source parameters: the stress drop ∆σ, the linear dimensions L

e W and the magnitude M. We assume that the magnitude M is proportional to the logarithm

of the seismic moment M0 (measured in Nm) according to the Kanamori and Anderson (1975)

relation:

log M0 = 9.1 + 1.5M.

(9)

Tables 4, 5 and (6) show the results obtained assigning a ﬁxed value for one of the parameters

at a time, and letting the others change. These simulations have been carried out by summation

of the single contributions of the elementary cells constituting the area surrounding the fault.

Only the seismicity triggered on the fault plane, but outside the fault edges, has been considered.

Looking at Table 4 one can notice that, under our hypoteses, for a constant stress drop, the total

number of triggered events increases about proportionally to the fault area LW . Theoretically

it should be exactly proportional to the area of the source, but in the calculations there are

numerical imprecisions due to the grid size approximations. These numerical simulations show,

also, that the number of aftershocks is proportional to the 2/3 power of the scalar seismic

moment or to the exponential of the magnitude (10M ), in agreement with the above theoretical

arguments. Table 5 clearly shows the proportionality existing between the stress drop ∆σ and

Ntot, having ﬁxed the linear dimensions of the fault. Furthermore, the results reported in Table

6 give credit to the hypothesis that, for a constant magnitude, the earthquakes of smaller linear

dimensions generate a larger number of triggered events.

Let’s mention, lastly, the results of a simple numerical test. We have theoretically shown

that the total number of events triggered by a stress change ∆τ per unit area is, after a time

much larger than the characteristic time ta, identical to the number of events inhibited by a

negative stress change

∆τ on the same area. The numerical simulations reﬂect this idea in a

−

more general way. In fact, if we take the total number of aftershocks produced in a time interval

of 100 years by a fault of 100 km2 on the portion of an area of 104 km2 external to it, we ﬁnd

353.2 events, while the same computation made including the negative contribution of the area

11

internal to fault itself gives only 15.6 (less than 5%). The idea of an overall null balance is,

then, substantially met: the phenomenon of clustering doesn’t change the long term seismicity

rate of a large area. This is in contrast with the opinion that trigger zones produce many more

shocks than are missing from the shadows (Toda and Stein, 2003). We neverthless regard for

Marsan (2003) that put in evidence the practical diﬃculty to observe in nature the lack of

events (the quiescence) mainly when looking at weakly active regions and short timescales.

5 Temporal behaviour of the triggered seismicity

Let’s now consider in more detail the dipendence on time of the number of triggered events

predicted by the present hypothesis. Kagan and Jackson (1991) and Dieterich (1994) found, in

their empirical works, that shallow aftershocks, above a given magnitude cutoﬀ, decay globally

(for diﬀerent distance intervals) in about 10 years and this time decay appears to sistematically

decrease with increasing depth. In our model the behaviour in diﬀerent zones depends on the

diﬀerent values of the stress changes, that decrease with the increasing distance from the edges

of the fault. It can be then noted that the plateau of the plot of the seismicity rate in time

(see Figure 3) has a duration that increases with the increasing distance from the source. This

result depends on our assumption of considering only aftershocks on the mainshock fault plane.

It can also be biased by the fact that we consider only the eﬀect of static stress step ∆τ and we

ignore the interaction between events. In spite of that, we believe that our model can decribe

a behavior not so far from reality. Therefore we keep as our reference the model of fault given

in Table 1.

As shown in Figure 6, in the close neighbouring of the fault (within 0.5 km from the

perimeter of the fault), most of the aftershocks occur within one day after the occurrence of

the inducing earthquake, and more than 1/3 of them occur already in the ﬁrst hour. This is

clearly not the case for further distance from the source: in the slice between 0.5 and 8.5 km

from the fault, about half of the activity is exploited within about one year. The further we

go apart from the source, the longer is the time interval necessary for the exploitment of the

triggered activity.

In fact, in the distant zone (from 20 to 100 km from the fault) most of

12

the triggered events occur longer than 20 years after the inducing earthquake. The behaviour

shown in Figure 6 is illustrated also by the snapshots of the spatial distribution of the seismicity

rate at diﬀerent times. Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10 clearly show how the distribution of aftershocks

resembles that of the stress change and how the time decay is diﬀerent in the diﬀerent slices.

We are now interested to know if the generalized Omori law is suitable to describe the

temporal behaviour of R′(t) predicted by our model in every spatial slice and, in such case,

by means of which free parameters. We refer to the generalized Omori law as to the formula

describing the decay of aftershock rate after a mainshock (Utsu et al., 1995) through three free

parameters a, c e p:

R′(t) =

a
(c + t)p .

For this purpose we make use of an algorithm for the least squares best-ﬁt of the sets of data

reported in Figure 6 by the integral of (10) over the time:

The results obtained for the best-ﬁt are shown in Table 7.

It is evident that the val-

ues of the parameters obtained are quite diﬀerent from case to case (for instance, the c

parameter is extremely small for the slices closest to the fault edges), and that the stan-

dard deviation is larger for the slices that include the wider range of distances from the

fault. These results show that the same set of parameters in equation (11) can not ﬁt the

synthetic values obtained for diﬀerent zones. The observation that the Omori p parameter

varies spatially in real aftershocks sequences has been documented in a number of papers

(10)

(11)

Wiemer et al. (2002) reported a case of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent c values in the northern and

southern Hector Mine aftershock volume, respectively. Enescu and Ito (2002) in their study of

aftershock activity of the 2000 Western Tottory earthquake found c-values very close to 0 except

for larger magnitude earthquakes, arguing that this feature could result from incompleteness

of data, or might also reﬂect the complexity of the rupture process.

The situation is illustrated also by the plots of Figures 11 and 12, showing the graphical

comparison between the synthetic data and the relative theoretical approximation for diﬀerent

slices.

6 Conclusions

The ﬁrst step of our modelling, concerning the stress change in the medium following an earth-

quake, has given results comparable to those of previous papers as, for instance, Chinnery (1961),

King and Cocco (2001), Belardinelli et al. (2003). This substantial agreement, though the sim-

pliﬁcations introduced in this speciﬁc case of rectangular source, supports the validity of our

methodology.

As to the interaction among seismic events, the application of the model of Dieterich (1994)

has shown how the total number of triggered events per unit area is proportional to the stress

change. Nevertheless, the time constant by which the rate of events decreases has a large

variability, ranging from a fraction of hour for a stress change of several MP a, up to tens of

years for stress variations smaller than 1 MP a.

A ﬁrst set of simulations carried out with a model of rectangular fault, based on the

hypothesis that most of the aftershocks occur on the same plane of the fault, has shed light

on the relationship between the main source parameters and the number of triggered events.

The simulations lead to the conclusion that many earthquakes of small magnitude can produce,

in total, a number of aftershocks comparable to that of fewer larger earthquakes. Our model

predicts, in fact, that, for a constant stress drop, the number of triggered events is roughly

proportional to the seismic moment at the power of 2/3, or equivalently to 10M .

An important aspect of the model concerns the time-space behaviour of the triggered seis-

micity. The simulations show that the application of the rate-state model and equation (7)

introduced by Dieterich (1994) to the static model of stress change has as a consequence some-

thing more complicate than the conventional Omori law for the temporal decay of aftershock

rate. In fact, the seismicity is expected to be intense (in accordance to the stress change,) and

have a maximum constant value, close to the fault edges of the primary earthquake, but the

time necessary for the starting of decay is shorter. On the contrary, the seismicity expected

at larger distances (up to 10 times the linear dimensions of the fault) is weak, but the time

necessary for the decay from the maximum value is longer (even some tens of years). We can

conclude that the temporal behaviour of aftershock rate varies in space and this is theoretically

because ”c” increases with the distance from the fault edge. Moreover, the model predicts that

the total long term production of aftershocks, including wider areas, is not negligible respect

to the short term production.

In this respect, the regional background seismicity could be

interpreted as a sort of noise, or memory, due to the superposition of the eﬀect of many older

earthquakes. The time decay described by the popular Omori law could be interpreted as an

apparent average result of the contribution from the various areas on the plane containing the

The rate-state model (Dieterich, 1994) used in our algorithm for the space distribution

of the stress change produced by a dislocation on a rectangular fault, has allowed a partial

justiﬁcation of the Omori law. We outline the following main conclusions obtained from the

simulations:

The seismic activity is very intense during the ﬁrst few hours or days after the occurrence

time of the primary earthquake, in the rectangular slice close to the edges of the fault;

The immediate decay of this intense activity is followed by a period of time during which

the activity at larger distance (of the order of the linear dimensions of the fault) is nearly

constant. For longer time (several years) the total number of triggered events in the

external zone becomes comparable with that of the most internal one.

15

•

•

the number of events triggered over a long time scale at distances larger than the fault

linear dimensions is signiﬁcantly large;

the seismic activity inside the fault drops to negligible values at the occurrence of the

primary earthquake and returns to normal values only after a time much longer than the

characteristic time (several tens of years in our simulations); for a long time range the

number of events inhibited inside the fault is comparable to that of the events triggered

outside: the net balance can be considered null; the seismicity rate changes in space and

time, but it doesn’t have inﬂuence on the rate averaged over very large intervals of space

and time.

We can conclude that the model here analysed, though its very simple conception, gives a

physical justiﬁcation both to the very popular phenomenon of short term earthquake clustering

(aftershocks and foreshocks in strict sense) and to that of the long term induction, also observed

in various occasions. Among the very crude approximations made in this model, two of the

most important are (a) having neglected the dishomogeneneity of the stress drop on the fault,

and consequently the very complicated pattern of slip (this must certainly have inﬂuence on

the aftershock pattern: some aftershocks may even occur inside the fault, where the gradient of

slip is high); (b) having neglected the interaction between subsequent events. Nevertheless, we

are conﬁdent that the reﬁnement of the model and its validations with real catalogs will bring

to even more interesting consequences.

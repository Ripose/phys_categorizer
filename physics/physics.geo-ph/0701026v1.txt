The asymmetric shape of reversals of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld indicates a possible connection
with relaxation oscillations as they were early discussed by van der Pol. A simple mean-ﬁeld
dynamo model with a spherically symmetric α coeﬃcient is analysed with view on this similarity,
and a comparison of the time series and the phase space trajectories with those of paleomagnetic
measurements is carried out. For highly supercritical dynamos a very good agreement with the data
is achieved. Deviations of numerical reversal sequences from Poisson statistics are analysed and
compared with paleomagnetic data. The role of the inner core is discussed in a spectral theoretical
context and arguments and numerical evidence is compiled that the growth of the inner core might
be important for the long term changes of the reversal rate and the occurrence of superchrons.

1 Introduction

It is well known from paleomagnetic measurements that the axial dipole component
of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld has reversed its polarity many times (Merrill et al.
1996). The last reversal occurred approximately 780000 years ago. Averaged over
the last few million years the mean rate of reversals is approximately 5 per Myr. At
least two superchrons have been identiﬁed as periods of some tens of million years
containing no reversal at all. These are the Cretaceous superchron extending from
approximately 118 to 83 Myr, and the Kiaman superchron extending approximately
from 312 to 262 Myr. Only recently, the existence of a third superchron has been
hypothesized for the time period between 480-460 Myr (Pavlov and Gallet 2005).

Apart from their irregular occurrence, one of the most intriguing features of re-
versals is the pronounced asymmetry in the sense that the decay of the dipole is
much slower than the subsequent recreation of the dipole with opposite polarity
(Valet and Meynadier 1993, Valet et al. 2005). Observational data also indicate a
possible correlation of the ﬁeld intensity with the interval between subsequent re-
versals (Cox 1968, Tarduno et al. 2001, Valet et al. 2005). A further hypothesis
concerns the so-called bimodal distribution of the Earth’s virtual axial dipole mo-
ment (VADM) with two peaks at approximately 4 × 1022 Am2 and at twice that

1

value (Perrin and Shcherbakov 1997, Shcherbakov et al. 2002, Heller et al. 2003).
There is an ongoing discussion about preferred paths of the virtual geomagnetic pole
(VGP) (Gubbins and Love 1998), and about diﬀerences of the apparent duration of
reversals when seen from sites at diﬀerent latitudes (Clement 2004).

The reality of reversals is quite complex and there is little hope to understand
all their details within a simple model. Of course, computer simulations of the geo-
dynamo in general and of reversals in particular (Wicht and Olson 2004, Takahashi
et al. 2005) have progressed much since the ﬁrst fully coupled 3D simulations of
a reversal by Glatzmaier and Roberts in 1995. However, the severe problem that
simulations have to work in parameter regions (in particular for the magnetic Pran-
dlt number and the Ekman number) which are far away from the real values of the
Earth, will remain for a long time.

With view on these problems to carry out realistic geodynamo simulations, but
also with a side view on the recent successful dynamo experiments (Gailitis et al.
2002), it is legitimate to ask what are the most essential ingredients for a dynamo
to undergo reversals in a similar way as the geodynamo does.

Roughly speaking, there are two classes of simpliﬁed models which try to explain
reversals (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst one relies on the assumption that the dipole ﬁeld is
somehow rotated from a given orientation to the reversed one via some intermediate
state (or states). The rationale behind this “rotation model” is that many kinematic
dynamo simulations have revealed an approximate degeneration of the axial and the
equatorial dipole (Gubbins et al. 2000, Aubert et al. 2004). A similar degeneration
is also responsible for the appearance of hemispherical dynamos in dynamically
coupled models (Grote and Busse 2000). In this case, both quadrupolar and dipolar
components contribute nearly equal magnetic energy so that their contributions
cancel in one hemisphere and add to each other in the opposite hemisphere.

The interplay between the nearly degenerated axial dipole, equatorial dipole,
and quadrupole was used in a simple model to explain reversals and excursion in
one common scheme (Melbourne et al. 2001). It is interesting that this model of
non-linear interaction of the three modes provides excursion and reversals without
the inclusion of noise.

A second model belonging to this class is the model developed by Hoyng and
coworkers (Hoyng et al. 2001, Schmidt et al. 2001, Hoyng and Duistermaat 2004)
which deals with one steady axial dipole mode coupled via noise to an oscillatory
“overtone” mode. Again, the idea is that the magnetic energy is taken over in an
intermediate time by this additional mode.

Another tradition to explain reversals relies on the very speciﬁc interplay between
a steady and an oscillatory branch of the dominant axial dipole mode. This idea was
expressed by Yoshimura et al. (1984) and by a number of other authors (Weisshaar
1982, Sarson and Jones 1999, Phillips 1993, Gubbins and Gibbons 2002).

In a series of recent papers we have tried to exemplify this scenario within a
strongly simpliﬁed mean-ﬁeld dynamo model. The starting point was the observa-
tion (Stefani and Gerbeth 2003) that even simple α2 dynamos with a spherically
symmetric helical turbulence parameter α can have oscillatory dipole solutions, at
least for a certain variety of proﬁles α(r) characterized by a sign change along the
radius. This restriction to spherically symmetric α models allows to decouple the

axial dipole mode from all other modes which reduces drastically the numerical ef-
fort to solve the induction equation. Hence, the general idea that reversals have
to do with transitions between the steady and the oscillatory branch of the same
eigenmode could be studied in great detail and with long time series.

In (Stefani and Gerbeth 2005) it was shown that such a spherically symmetric
dynamo model, complemented by a simple saturation model and subjected to noise,
can exhibit some of the above mentioned reversal features. In particular, the model
produced asymmetric reversals, a positive correlation of ﬁeld strength and interval
length, and a bimodal ﬁeld distribution. All these features were attributable to the
magnetic ﬁeld dynamics in the vicinity of a branching point (or exceptional point)
of the spectrum of the non-selfadjoint dynamo operator where two real eigenvalues
coalesce and continue as a complex conjugated pair of eigenvalues. Usually, this
exceptional point is associated with a nearby local maximum of the growth rate
situated at a slightly lower magnetic Reynolds number. It is essential that the nega-
tive slope of the growth rate curve between this local maximum and the exceptional
point makes even stationary dynamos vulnerable to noise. Then, the instantaneous
eigenvalue is driven towards the exceptional point and beyond into the oscillatory
branch where the sign change happens.

An evident weakness of this reversal model in the slightly supercritical regime
was the apparent necessity to ﬁne-tune the magnetic Reynolds number and/or the
radial proﬁle α(r) in order to adjust the dynamo operator spectrum in an appropriate
way. However, in a follow-up paper (Stefani et al. 2006a), it was shown that this
artiﬁcial ﬁne-tuning becomes superﬂuous in the case of higher supercriticality of
the dynamo (a similar eﬀect was already found for disk dynamos by Meinel and
Brandenburg (1990)). Numerical examples and physical arguments were compiled
to show that, with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, there is a strong tendency
for the exceptional point and the associated local maximum to move close to the zero
growth rate line where the indicated reversal scenario can be actualized. Although
exempliﬁed again by the spherically symmetric α2 dynamo model, the main idea
of this “self-tuning” mechanism of saturated dynamos into a reversal-prone state

3

seems well transferable to other dynamos.

In another paper (Stefani et al. 2006b) we have compared time series of the
dipole moment as they result from our simple model with the recently published
time series of the last ﬁve reversals which occurred during the last 2 Myr (Valet et
al. 2005). Both the relevant time scales and the typical asymmetric shape of the
paleomagnetic reversal sequences were reproduced within our simple model. Note
that this was achieved strictly on the basis of the molecular resistivity of the core
material, without taking resort to any turbulent resistivity.

An important ingredient of this sort of reversal models, the sign change of α along
the radius, was also utilized in the reversal model of Giesecke et al. (2005a). This
model is much closer to reality since it includes the usual North-South asymmetry
of α. Interestingly, the sign change of α along the radius is by no means unphysical
but results indeed from simulations of magneto-convection which were carried out
by the same authors (Giesecke et al. 2005b).

It is one of the goals of the present paper to make a strong case for the “oscillation
model” in contrast to the ”rotation model”. We will show that the asymmetry of
the reversals is very well recovered by our model in the case of high (although
not very high) supercriticality. At the same time, we will show that the “rotation
model” in the version presented by Hoyng and Duistermaat (2004) leads to the
wrong asymmetry of reversals.

We will start our argumentation by elucidating the intimate connection of re-
versals with relaxation oscillations as they are well known from the van der Pol
oscillator (van der Pol 1926). Actually, the connection of dynamo solutions with re-
laxation oscillations had been discussed in the context of the 22 year cycle of Sun’s
magnetic ﬁeld (Mininni et al. 2000., Pontieri et al. 2003) and its similarity with
reversals was brought to our attention by Clement Narteau (2005). We will provide
evidence for a strong similarity of the dynamics of the van der Pol oscillator and
of our simple dynamo model. We will also reveal the same relaxation oscillation
character in the above mentioned reversals data.

In a second part we will discuss some statistical properties of our reversal model
within the context of real reversal data. We will focus on the “clustering property”
of reversals which was observed by Carbone et al. (2006) and further analyzed by
Sorriso-Valvo et al. (2006).

A third focus of this paper will lay on the inﬂuence of the inner core on the
reversal model. One of the usually adopted hypotheses on the role of the inner core
goes back to Hollerbach and Jones (1993 and 1995) who claimed the conductivity of
the inner core might prevent the magnetic ﬁeld from more frequent reversals. We will
discuss the core inﬂuence in terms of a particular spectral resonance phenomenon
that was observed by G¨unther and Kirillov (2006). As a consequence, an increasing
inner core can even favor reversals before it starts to produce more excursions than
reversals. This will bring us ﬁnally to a speculation on the determining role the inner
core growth might have on the long term reversal rate and on the (quasi-periodic?)
occurrence of superchrons.

alternative model which was proposed by Hoyng and Duistermaat (2004) as a toy
model of reversals. The connection with real reversal sequences will be discussed in
the last subsection.

2.1 The models

2.1.1 Van der Pol oscillator

The van der Pol equation is an ordinary diﬀerential equation of second order which
describes self-sustaining oscillations. This equation was shown to arise in circuits
containing vacuum tubes (van der Pol 1926) and relies on the fact that energy is fed
into small oscillations and removed from large oscillations. It is given by

which can be rewritten into an equivalent system of two coupled ﬁrst order diﬀer-
ential equations:

∂2y
∂t2 = µ(1 − y2)

∂t

− y

= z

∂y
∂t
∂z
∂t

= µ(1 − y2)z − y .

(2)

(3)

Evidently, the case µ = 0 yields harmonic oscillations while increasing µ provides
increasing anharmonicity.

2.1.2 Spherically symmetric α2 dynamo model

For a better understanding of the reversal process we have decided to use a toy
model which is simple enough to allow for simulations of very long time series (in
order to do reasonable statistics), but which is also capable to capture distinctive
features of hydromagnetic dynamos, in particular the typical non-trivial saturation
mechanism via deformations of the dynamo source. Both requirements together
are fulﬁlled by a mean-ﬁeld dynamo model of α2 type with a supposed spherically
symmetric, isotropic helical turbulence parameter α (Krause and R¨adler 1980). Of
course, we are well aware of the fact that a reasonable simulation of the Earth’s
dynamo should at least account for the North-South asymmetry of α which is not
respected in our model. Only in the last but one section we will discuss certain
spectral features of such a more realistic model.

Starting from the induction equation for the magnetic ﬁeld B

∂B
∂t

= ∇ × (αB) + (µ0σ)−1∇2B ,

(4)

(with magnetic permeability µ0 and electrical conductivity σ) we decompose B into
a poloidal and a toroidal component, according to B = −∇ × (r × ∇S) − r × ∇T .

5

Then we expand the deﬁning scalars S and T in spherical harmonics of degree l and
order m with expansion coeﬃcients sl,m(r, t) and tl,m(r, t). As long as we remain
within the framework of a spherically symmetric and isotropic α2 dynamo problem,
the induction equation decouples for each degree l and order m into the following
pair of equations

Since these equations are independent of the order m, we have skipped m in the
index of s and t. The boundary conditions are ∂sl/∂r|r=1 + (l + 1)sl(1) = tl(1) = 0.
In the following we consider only the dipole ﬁeld with l = 1.

We will focus on kinematic radial proﬁles αkin(r) with a sign change along the
radius which had been shown to exhibit oscillatory behaviour (Stefani and Gerbeth
2003). Saturation is enforced by assuming the kinematic proﬁle αkin(r) to be alge-
braically quenched by the magnetic ﬁeld energy averaged over the angles which can
be expressed in terms of sl(r, τ ) and tl(r, τ ). Note that this averaging over the angles
represents a severe simpliﬁcation since in reality (even for an assumed spherically
symmetric kinematic α) the energy dependent quenching would result in a breaking
of the spherical symmetry.

In addition to this quenching, the α(r) proﬁles are perturbed by ”blobs” of noise
which are considered constant within a correlation time τcorr. Physically, such a
noise term can be understood as a consequence of changing boundary conditions
for the ﬂow in the outer core, but also as a substitute for the omitted inﬂuence of
higher multipole modes on the dominant axial dipole mode.

In summary, the α(r, τ ) proﬁle entering Eqs. (5) and (6) is written as

α(r, τ ) =

where the noise correlation is given by hξi(τ )ξj(τ + τ1)i = D2(1 − |τ1|/τcorr)Θ(1 −
|τ1|/τcorr)δij. In the following, C will characterize the amplitude of α, D is the noise
strength, and Emag,0 is a constant measuring the mean magnetic ﬁeld energy.

2.1.3 An alternative: The model of Hoyng and Duistermaat

Later we will compare our results with the results of the model introduced by Hoyng
and Duistermaat (2004) which describes a steady axial dipole (x) coupled by multi-
plicative noise to a periodic “overtone” (y+iz). It is given by the ordinary diﬀerential
equation system:

∂tx = (1 − x2)x + V11x + V12y + V13z
∂ty = −ay − cz + V21x + V22y + V23z
∂tz = cy − az + V31x + V32y + V33z .

Figure 2: Typical relaxation oscillations in the van der Pol model (left) and in the
α2 dynamo model (right). With increasing µ and C, respectively, one observes an
increasing degree of anharmonicity. In the dynamo case, this even goes over into a
steady state.

Evidently, without noise terms Vik this systems decouples into a steady axial dipole
and a periodic “overtone”.

2.2 Numerical results in the noise-free case

In Fig. 2 we show the numerical solutions of the van der Pol oscillator for diﬀerent
values of µ, compared with the solutions of our dynamo model with a kinematic α
proﬁle according to αkin(r) = 1.916 · C · (1 − 6 r2 + 5 r4) (the factor 1.916 results
simply from normalizing the radial average of |α(r)| to the corresponding value for
constant α). In the dynamo model we vary the dynamo number C in the noise-
free case (i.e. D = 0). As already noticed, in the van der Pol oscillator we get a
purely harmonic oscillation for µ = 0 which becomes more and more anharmonic
for increasing µ. A quite similar behaviour can be observed for the dynamo model.
At C = 6.8 (which is only slightly above the critical value Cc = 6.78) we obtain
a nearly harmonic oscillation which becomes also more and more anharmonic for
increasing C. The diﬀerence to the van der Pol system is that at a certain value of
C the oscillation stops at all and is replaced by a steady solution (C = 7.24).

For the two values µ = 2 and C = 7.237, respectively, we analyze the time
evolution in more detail in Fig. 3. The upper two panels show y(t) and y′(t) =
z(t) in the van der Pol case and s(r = 1) and the time derivative s′(r = 1) in
the dynamo case. The lower two panels show the real and imaginary parts of the
instantaneous eigenvalue λ(t). A note is due here on the deﬁnition and the usefulness
of such instantaneous eigenvalues. For the dynamo problem they result simply from
inserting the instantaneous quenched α(r, ti) proﬁles at the instant ti into the time-
independent eigenvalue equation. Quite formally, we could do the same for the van

der Pol system by replacing in the nonlinear term in Eq. (3) y2 by y2(ti). Of course,
for a non-linear dynamical system it is more signiﬁcant to consider the eigenvalues
of the instantaneous Jacobi matrix1 which reads

J(y(ti), z(ti)) =

(cid:20)

0

1

−1 − 2µy(ti)z(ti) µ(1 − y2(ti))

(cid:21)

(11)

In the third and fourth line of the left panel of Fig. 3 we show the real and imaginary
parts of this instantaneous Jacobi matrix eigenvalues, together with the eigenvalues
resulting from the formal replacement of y2 by y2(ti). It is not surprising that the
latter shows a closer similarity to the instantaneous eigenvalues for the dynamo
problem which are exhibited in the right panel.

Despite the slight diﬀerences, we see in any case that during the reversal there
appears a certain interval characterized by a complex instantaneous eigenvalue which
is “born” at an exceptional point where two real eigenvalues coalesce and which splits
oﬀ again at a second exceptional point into two real eigenvalues.

It is also instructive to show the trajectories in the phase space, both for the van
der Pol and for the dynamo problem. Figure 4 indicates that the systems are quite
similar.

1We recall that the Jacobi matrix J(x0) is given by the ﬁrst-order derivative terms in a Taylor
expansion of a nonlinear vector valued function F(x) = F(x0) + J(x0)(x − x0) + O([x − x0]2) and
characterizes a local linearization in the vicinity of a given x0 (see Childress and Gilbert 1995).

2.3 Self-tuning into reversal prone states

Up to now we have only seen how a dynamo which is oscillatory in the kinematic
and slightly supercritical regime changes, via increasingly anharmonic relaxation
oscillation, into a steady dynamo for higher degrees of supercriticality. However, in
the latter regime, we can learn much more when we analyze the spectrum of the
dynamo operators belonging to the actual quenched α(r) proﬁles in the saturated
state. This will help us to understand the disposition of the (apparently steady)
dynamo to undergo reversals under the inﬂuence of noise.

For this purpose we have shown in Fig. 5 the growth rates (left) and the fre-
quencies (right) of the dynamo in the (nearly) kinematic regime (for C=6.78) and
for the quenched α proﬁles in the saturated regime with increasing values of C.
Actually, the curves result from scaling the actual quenched α proﬁles with an ar-
tiﬁcial pre-factor C ∗. This artiﬁcial scaling helps to identify the position of the
actual eigenvalue (corresponding to C ∗ = 1) relative to the exceptional point. For
C = 6.78, we see that the ﬁrst and second eigenvalue merge at a value of C ∗ at
which the growth rate is less than zero. At C ∗ = 1 it is evidently an oscillatory
dynamo. However, already for C = 8 the exceptional point has moved far above
the zero growth rate line. Interestingly, for even higher values of C the exceptional
point and the nearby local maximum return close to the zero growth rate line. It
can easily be anticipated that steady dynamos which are characterized by a stable
ﬁxed point become increasingly unstable with respect to noise. More examples of
this self-tuning mechanism can be found in a preceding paper (Stefani et al 2006a).

actual eigenvalue (at C ∗ = 1) in its relative position to the exceptional point. Note
that for highly supercritical C the exceptional point moves close to the zero growth
rate line.

2.4 Reversals as noise induced relaxation oscillations

In this section, we will study highly supercritical dynamos under the inﬂuence of
noise. We will vary the parameters C and D and check their inﬂuence on the time
scale and the shape of reversals. Then we will compare the phase space trajectories
during numerical reversals with those of paleomagnetic ones. Although the dynamo
is not anymore in the oscillatory regime the typical features of relaxation oscillation
re-appear during the reversal. Figure 6 shows typical magnetic ﬁeld series for a
time interval of 100 diﬀusion times which would correspond to approximately 20
Myr in time units of the real Earth. Not very surprisingly, the increase of noise
leads to an increase of the reversal rate. The two documented values of C indicate
also a positive correlation of dynamo strength and reversal frequency, although this
dependence is not always monotonic as was shown in (Stefani et al. 2006a).

In Fig. 7 we compare now paleomagnetic time series during reversals with time
series resulting form the α2 model on one side and from the Hoyng-Duistermaat
model on the other side. Figure 7a represents the virtual axial dipole moments
(VADM) during the last ﬁve reversals as they were published by Valet et al. (2005).
Actually, the data points in Fig. 7a were extracted from Fig. 4 of (Valet et al. 2005).
One can clearly see the strongly asymmetric shape of the curves with a slow dipole
decay that takes around 50 kyr followed by fast dipole recovery taking approximately
5- 10 kyr. Since the curves represent an average over many site samples the VADM
does not go exactly to zero at the reversal point. It is useful to take an average over
these ﬁve curves in order to compare it with the time series following from various
numerical models.

The comparison of the real data with the numerical time series for C = 20, D = 6
in Fig. 7b shows a nice correspondence. Quite in contrast to this, the time series
of the Hoyng-Duistermaat model show a wrong asymmetry (Fig. 7c). We compare
the averages of real data, of our model results, and of the Hoyng-Duistermaat model

10

Figure 6: Time series for various values of C and D for the kinematic proﬁle

results in Fig. 7d. Apart from the slightly supercritical case C = 8, D = 1 which
exhibits a much to slow magnetic ﬁeld evolution, the other examples with C =20,
50 and D = 6 show very realistic time series with the typical slow decay and fast
recreation. As noted above, the fast recreation results from the fact that in a small
interval during the transition the dynamo operates with a nearly unquenched α(r)
proﬁle which yields, in case that the dynamo is strongly supercritical, very high
growth rates.

With view on the relaxation oscillation property it may also be instructive to
show the phase space trajectories in Fig. 8. In the curves of the real data, we have
left out the data points very close to the sign change since these are not very reliable.
Apart from this detail, we see in the paleomagnetic data and the numerical data the
typical asymmetric shape of the phase space trajectories.

3 Clustering properties of reversal sequences

The question whether the time intervals between reversals are governed by a Poisson
process or not has been discussed by several authors (McFadden 1984, Constable
2000). The main diﬃculty in this approach is that, due to the poor statistics of
the real data, the distribution of the time intervals between successive events is not

distribution (that would be the case for a random, Poisson process) and a power-
law process (indicating presence of correlations). Moreover, Constable (2000) has

shown that the mean reversal rate is changing in the course of time, which would
correspond to a non-stationary Poisson process with a time dependent rate function.
This phenomenology could generate a power-law statistics for the inter-event times,
even in absence of correlations. Only recently Carbone et al. (2006) were able to
prove the non-Poissonian character of the reversal process by applying a criterion
to the reversal sequence which works also for non-local Poisson processes.

A central quantity in their analysis is

H(δt, ∆t) = 2δt/(2δt + ∆t)

(12)

(13)

(14)

wherein, for a given reversal instant ti, δt is deﬁned as the minimum of the preceding
and subsequent time interval:

δt = min{ti+1 − ti; ti − ti−1} .

∆t is then the “pre-preceding” or ”sub-subsequent” time interval, respectively, ac-
cording to

∆t = ti+2 − ti+1 or ti−1 − ti−2 .

if reversals are clustered then the ∆t
The meaning of H(δt, ∆t) is quite simple:
(which follows or precedes the δt which is, by deﬁnition (10), assumed to be small)
will also be small, and since ∆t appears in the denominator of Eq. (9), H(δt, ∆t)
will be comparably large. In contrast, if the reversal sequence is governed by voids,
then ∆t will be rather large and H(δt, ∆t) will be rather small. It can easily be
shown that, for a sequence of random events, described by a Poisson process, the
values of H(δt, ∆t) must be uniformly distributed in [0, 1]. The interesting thing
with this formulation is that, because of its local character, it indicates clustering or
the appearance of voids even in the case of inhomogeneous Poisson processes (with
time dependent rate function).

The sequence of paleomagnetic reversal data was shown to have a signiﬁcant
tendency to cluster (Carbone et al. 2006). In a follow-up paper (Sorriso-Valvo et
al. 2006), various simpliﬁed dynamo models were examined with respect to their
capability to describe this clustering process. In particular it turned out that the α2
dynamo model showed the right clustering property, although in a more pronounced
way than the paleomagnetic data (Cande and Kent 1995).

In this section we analyze this behaviour a bit more in detail by checking the
quantity H for a variety of values C and D. In order to better emphasize and better
visualize the shape of the H distribution function, we show here the corresponding
surviving function, namely the probability P (h > H).
In the Poisson (or local
Poisson) case, that is uniform distribution of H, the surviving function would depend
linearly on h, namely P (h > H) = 1 − h. The results are shown in Fig. 9. The
dependence of P (h > H) on H is shown for diﬀerent values of D from C = 20 (Fig.
9a) and C = 100 (Fig. 9b). In Fig. 9c, we compare the best curves for C = 20, 50,
and 100 with the paleomagnetic data (Cande and Kent 1995). Especially for C = 20,
D = 7 and C = 50, D = 6 we observe a nearly perfect agreement, indicating that
the temporal distribution of the reversals captures the real data features, including
their tendency to cluster. In contrast to this, the model of Hoyng and Duistermaat
shows more or less a Poisson behaviour (Fig. 9d). Note that the discrepancy of the
results presented here for the Hoyng model from those reported in Carbone et al.
(2006) and in Sorriso-Valvo et al. (2006), are due to the removal of the excursion-like
events.

4 The role of the inner core

In this section we will study the inﬂuence of an inner core within the framework
of our simple model. The usual picture of the role of the inner core was expressed
in two papers by Hollerbach and Jones (1993, 1995). Basically, one expects that
the conducting inner core impedes the occurrence of reversals by the eﬀect that
the magnetic ﬁeld evolution is governed there by the long diﬀusion time scale and
cannot follow the magnetic ﬁeld evolution in the outer core which is governed by
much shorter time scales of convection. Finally this will lead to a dominance of
excursion over reversals (Gubbins 1999).

In the following we will check if and how this simple picture translates into
our model. To begin with, we analyze the magnetic ﬁeld evolution for a family of
kinematic α proﬁles

1.914 · C

Basically this is a similar proﬁle as considered before but the denominator 1 +
exp [(x0 − x)/d] makes it vanishing in the inner core region with radius x0 (including
a smooth transition region of thickness d which is simply used for numerical reasons).
For this model, with the special choice C = 20, x0 = 0.35 and d = 0.05, Fig. 10a
shows the time evolution of s(x = 1). In contrast to all models considered before, we
get now an oscillation around a non-zero mean value (which was already observed

by Hollerbach and Jones (1995)). Analogously as reversals can be traced to the
transition between steady and oscillatory modes, the new “excursive” behaviour
can also be explained in terms of the spectral properties of the underlying dynamo
operator. To see this we consider in Fig. 10b the instantaneous α proﬁles at the
instants 1, 2, 3, 4 indicated in Fig. 10a. For these instantaneous α proﬁles we show
the ﬁrst three eigenvalues in Fig. 10c, again in dependence on the artiﬁcal scaling
parameter C ∗. In this picture an excursion occurs as follows: First, at instant 1, the
dominant eigenvalue is the complex one resulting from the merging of the second
and third radial eigenmode. Its real part is clearly larger than the real part of the
ﬁrst eigenvalue. Being thus governed by a complex eigenvalue, the system starts to
undergo a reversal. However, during this attempted oscillationthe non-linear back-
reaction becomes weaker (instant 2). Hence α becomes less quenched and we end
up with a new instantaneous dynamo operator whose ﬁrst real eigenvalue becomes
dominant and whose second oscillatory branch becomes subdominant. Therefore,
the system is governed now by a real and positive eigenvalue and the magnetic ﬁeld
increases again before it was able to complete the sign change. Later, the system
returns to the state with stronger α quenching were the oscillatory mode becomes
dominant again and so on.

That way, we have traced back excursions to the intricate ordering of the real
ﬁrst eigenvalue and the complex merger of the second and the third eigenvalue.
The deep reason for this complicated behaviour has been indicated in the paper
by G¨unther and Kirillov (2006), although for the case of zero boundary conditions
which changes the spectrum drastically. In terms of the total α(r) proﬁle, an inner
core of a certain radius will contribute in form of higher radial harmonics. Splitting
the induction equation into a coupled equation system for diﬀerent radial harmonics
(here Bessel functions) we observe a resonance phenomenon. Radial α proﬁles with
higher harmonics in radial direction will also favour radial magnetic ﬁeld modes
with comparative wavelengths. Roughly speaking, an α(r) proﬁle with one sign
change along the radius (i.e. of the form (1 − 6x2 + 2 − 5x4)) will favour the

second eigenmode whose larger growth rate will tend to merge with that of the ﬁrst
eigenmode. Including a core, however, the third harmonic will be favoured and will
merge with the second eigenfunction and so on.

Now let us switch to a core model with higher supercriticality. In Fig. 11 we con-
sidered the modiﬁed (and, admittedly, somewhat tuned) time dependent kinematic

We carry out a simulation of this model, with C = 50, D = 6, and d = 0.05, by
increasing the inner core radius x0 every 10 diﬀusion times by 0.05 (see Fig. 11b).
The result can be seen in Fig. 11a.

The ﬁrst observation is that the role of the inner core is quite complicated.
Starting from x0 = 0 we see that with increasing x0 the reversal frequency increases
drastically. This is in clear contradiction to the Hollerbach and Jones picture. The
second observation is that for larger x0 the inner core indeed has a tendency to
favour excursions in comparison with reversals which conﬁrms again the Hollerbach
and Jones view. At least we can see that the role of the inner core is much more
complicated since the selection of modes which are coupling at an exceptional point
depends very sensitively on its radius.

5 Towards more realistic models

We will conclude our study with an “excursion” into more realistic dynamo models.
As we have seen, the time characteristics and the asymmetry of the real reversal

17

process is well recovered within a simple dynamo model that requires only a dynamo
operator with a local maximum of the growth rate and a nearby exceptional point
where the two real eigenvalues merge and continue as oscillatory mode. This is a
very unspeciﬁc requirement which does not rely on speciﬁc assumptions on the ﬂow
structure in the core. Nevertheless, it would be nice to see if and how this picture
translates into more realistic dynamo models.

In the model of Giesecke (2005a), which includes the North-South asymmetry
of α by virtue of a cos(θ) term, quite similar reversal sequences were observed.
Actually, in contrast to our model, Gieseckes model assumes a turbulent resistivity
which is approximately 10 times larger than the molecular one. We believe that
this necessity would disappear when going over from slightly to highly supercritical
dynamos. In this respect it is instructive to compare again the two curves for C = 8
and C = 20 in Fig. 7d which are characterized by very diﬀerent decay and growth
times.

Apart from this detail, it is worthwhile to look a bit deeper into the spectral prop-
erty of Gieseckes dynamo model. For that purpose we have analyzed the spectrum
of the dynamo operator for functions of α(r, θ) according to

αkin(r, θ) = Rm cos(θ) sin [2π(x − x0)/(1 − x0)] .

(18)

Figure 12 shows the eigenvalues of the ﬁrst ﬁve axisymmetric modes (m=0) and the
ﬁrst three non-axisymmetric modes (m=1) for diﬀerent values of the inner core size
x0. The growth rates and frequencies result from an integral equation solver which
was documented in previous papers (Stefani et al. 2000, Xu et al. 2004a, Xu et
al. 2004b, Stefani et al. 2006c). The most important point which is changed by
the inclusion of the cos(θ) term is that now diﬀerent l-modes are not independent
anymore. Hence it may happen that modes with neighbouring l merge at an ex-
ceptional point which was forbidden in the spherically symmetric model considered
so far. Therefore, the scheme of mode coupling becomes even more complicated as
before and one might expect a higher sensitivity with respect to changes of the inner
core radius x0.

Restricting our attention to the m = 0 modes, we observe for x0 = 0 an immedi-
ate coupling of the modes 2 and 3, which split oﬀ again close to Rm = 4. The next
coupling occurs close to Rm = 11.5, but the resulting low lying mode seems not rel-
evant for the reversal process. For x0 = 0.2, the modes 2 and 3 are coupled from the
very beginning, but the mode 1 and 4 couple also close to Rm = 13. For x0 = 0.35,
which is approximately the case for the Earth, we see an immediate coupling of the
modes 2 and 3 on one side and of the modes 4 and 5 on the other side. The latter
split oﬀ again close to Rm = 16, but shortly after this the mode 4 couples again with
the mode 1. For x0 = 0.5, the low modes show no coupling at all, only the mode 5
couples to the mode 6 which is, however, not shown in the plot. In summary, this
gives a complicated scheme of mode coupling and exceptional points which is quite
sensitive to the value of x0. What is missing at the moment is a detailed study of
the spectral properties of the dynamo operator in the saturated regime which must
be left to future work. We had indicated in Fig. 5 (and substantiated in more
detail in (Stefani et al. 2006b)) that highly supercritical dynamos have a tendency
to self-tune into a state in which they are prone to reversals. Hence Fig 12 can be

quite misleading when it comes to the exact position of the exceptional points of the
dominant mode. And, of course, one should not forget that the nearly degeneration
between m = 0 and m = 1 will also be lifted if a tensor structure of α and further
mean-ﬁeld coeﬃcients come into play as it is typical in more realistic mean-ﬁeld
models of the geodynamo (Schrinner et al. 2005, 2006).

6 Summary and speculations

We have checked the capability of a simple α2 dynamo model with spherical sym-
metric α to explain the typical time-scales and the asymmetric shape of Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld reversals. The results are quite encouraging, in particular when com-
paring the paleomagnetic and the numerical reversal data in Figs. 7 and 8. In our
view, the interpretation of reversals as noise induced relaxation oscillations seems
quite natural. This mechanism of reversals relies on the existence of a local growth
rate maximum and a nearby exceptional point of the spectrum of the dynamo op-
erator in the saturated regime.

The clustering properties which were recently shown to be present in real pale-
omagnetic data (Carbone et al. 2006) were also observed in the model. Both the
typical time scales of reversals and the degree of deviation from Poissonian statistics
indicate that the Earth dynamo works in a regime of high, although not extremely
high, supercriticality.

We conclude this paper with a speculation on a possible connection of the inner
core radius with the long term behaviour of the reversal rate, including the occur-
rence of superchrons. It starts from the observation that the reversals rate of the
last 160 Myr (see Merrill et al. 1996) suggests a time scale of long term variation in
the order of 100 Myr. If one would take into account the Kiaman superchron, and
possibly the (up to present unsettled) third superchron discovered by Pavlov and
Gallet, one might hypothesize a process with a period of approximately 200 Myr.
What could be the nature of such a periodicity (if there were any)? The ﬁrst idea
that comes to mind is the connection with slow mantle convection processes that
inﬂuence, by virtue of changed core-mantle boundary conditions, the heat transport
in the core, hence the dynamo strength and ultimately the reversal rate.

But what about the inner core? Is there a possibility that such a 200 Myr
variability (or periodicity?) be related to a resonance phenomenon of the spectral
properties of the dynamo operator for increasing inner core size? What we have
seen at least is a strong inﬂuence of the inner core size on the selection of the two
eigenmodes which merge together at an exceptional point into an oscillatory mode.
This selection, in turn, has a strong inﬂuence on the reversal rate. A most important
criterion for testing such a hypothesis is the age of the inner core. Unfortunately,
the data on this point vary wildly in the literature, ranging from values of 500
Myr until 2500 Myr with a most likely value around 1000 Myr (Labrosse 2001).
It is not excluded that a typical periodicity of some 200 Million years could result
from an inner core growing on these time scales. At least it seems worth to test
this hypothesis by further analysing the spectra of realistic and highly supercritical
dynamo models in the saturated regime.

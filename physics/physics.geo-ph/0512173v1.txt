Comments on “Viscosity of high crystal content melts:
dependence on solid fraction”

A new parameterisation describing the relationship between viscosity and solid fraction valid

at large solid content was recently proposed in Costa [2005]:

η(φ) =

1

(cid:26)

α erf

√π

(cid:18)

φ

1 +

(cid:20)

(1

φ)γ (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:27)

B/α

β

where η is the relative viscosity, φ the volume fraction of particles, B the Einstein coefﬁcient

(with a theoretical value B = 2.5), and α, β, γ are three adjustable parameters. The proposed

parameterisation approximately reduces to the classical, well established relationships for small

fractions. On the other hand, a weak point of equation (1) is that for large φ, the relative viscosity

tends quickly to a constant value, because the non-linear term in the erf function rapidly saturates

it as φ approaches unity.

For very large solid fractions, no reliable experimental data are available and there are also some

intrinsic problems even in properly deﬁning relative viscosity [see Costa, 2005]. However,

we can reasonably assume that the trend of the viscosity-crystal content relationship obtained

from data by van der Molen and Paterson [1979] at high solid fractions for partially-melted

granite is generally valid, and this it can be roughly described by a power law relationship. In

fact, there is no reason to assume that effective relative viscosity of melted rocks tends towards

a plateau region as φ

1 as predicted by (1). From a quantitative point of view it is no

simple to determine correctly the controlling parameters, such as the critical fraction at which a

rheological transition occurs or the maximum value that effective relative viscosity can reach as

1. Moreover there are several indications that these values strongly depend on the particle

shape and particle size distribution. However, since magma viscosity controls magma transport,

when modelling volcanic processes such as dome growth there is a strong need to estimate the

viscosity dependence on crystal-content, even in the limit of very high crystal content where no

experimental observations are available [see e.g., Melnik and Sparks, 2005].

Here we propose a simple modiﬁcation of relationship (1) which improves all the main positive

features of it, yet at the same time, does not show a plateau region as φ

1, generally increases

the performance of the model, and exactly recovers the classical well established relationships

valid for small fractions. In order to obtain a satisfactory description of the effective relative

viscosity on the entire range of φ, from zero to near the unity, one more parameter is necessary,

of the rheological transition, and δ controls the increase of η as φ

for large δ, the second term at the numerator represents a negligible correction when φ < φ∗,

whilst it becomes important when φ > φ∗. It easy to see that as φ < φ∗ with decreasing φ, the

parameterisation (2) tends exactly to the Krieger and Dougherty [1959] relationship:

and as φ

where B is the Einstein coefﬁcient.

An example of the good performance of relationship (2) is shown in Figure 1. Here we plotted

relative viscosities deduced from the data of van der Molen and Paterson [1979] in the high

crystal fraction regime, considering as an example a crystal-free ﬂuid viscosity of 105 Pa s. These

values are matched with relative viscosities measured at lower solid content for Mg3Al2Si3O12

by Lejeune and Richet [1995] and mean values of relative viscosities reported by Thomas [1965].

Although we must keep in mind all the intrinsic limitations of these data [see Costa, 2005], we

can observe that over the entire range of solid fraction, the model is able to reproduce all data

with an excellent correlation (R2 = 0.999) and the curve behaviour suggested by van der Molen

and Paterson [1979].

[1995] (triangles) and from mean value of relative viscosities reported by Thomas [1965] at

low solid fraction (squares). For data by van der Molen and Paterson [1979], for crystal-free

ﬂuid viscosity at 800oC and 300 MPa, we considered a value of µl = 105 Pa s. The correlation

coefﬁcient is 0.999. The best ﬁt parameters are α = 0.9998, i.e. ηmax ≃

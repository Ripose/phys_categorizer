Comment on “Analysis of the Spatial Distribu-
tion Between Successive Earthquakes” by David-
sen and Paczuski
Davidsen and Paczuski [1] claim to have found evidence
contradicting the theory of aftershock zone scaling in
favor of scale-free statistics. We present four elements
showing that Davidsen and Paczuski’s results may be in-
sensitive to the existence of physical length scales associ-
ated with aftershock zones or mainshock rupture lengths,
so that their claim is unsubstantiated.

Firstly, the power law exponent δ of their probability
density distribution (pdf) for distances between pairs of
successive earthquakes in southern California is less than
1. Therefore the exponent cannot hold for the tail be-
cause the pdf cannot be normalized and hence can at
most describe an intermediate asymptotic (if any). The
real tail of the pdf must behave diﬀerently, independent
of any ﬁnite size scaling.

Secondly, we performed tests that show the extreme
sensitivity of the suggested power law to the duration of
the catalog. We took the same catalog from the South-
ern California Earthquake Data Center as in [1] with the
same parameters but contrasted in Figure 1 the highly
active 6-month period from June 1, 1992 until Decem-
ber 31, 1992 including the June 28 M7.3 Landers earth-
quake (crosses) with the remainder of the catalog both
before and after Landers (circles). Firstly, we see that
removing 6 months of data from a 17 year period causes
the power law to disappear. Secondly, the Landers af-
tershocks show clear signs of scales, such as the bump
marked by an arrow, which may be connected with the
simultaneous aftershocks of the June 28 M6.4 Big Bear
event and the July 11 M5.7 Mojave earthquake and the
rupture length of Landers.

Thirdly, we repeated the same analysis for Japan
and northern California and found no evidence of ro-
bust power laws. For Japan (Figure 2, circles), we
used the JMA catalog from January 1984 to Decem-
ber 2001 within (120.0oE, 150.0oE) by (25.0oN, 45.0oN )
above magnitude thresholds md = 3.0, 3.4 and 4.0 result-
ing in 34163, 13275 and 6757 pairs with distances larger
than 2km, respectively. For northern California (Figure
2, crosses), we used data in the period from January 1984
until December 2004 (28274 events above magnitude 2.4).
Our results suggest that the power law found by David-
sen and Pazcuski [1] may not be robust with respect to
location, catalog and window size.

Finally, we show in the inset of ﬁgure 2 that a model
[2] that explicitely obeys aftershock zone scaling can re-
produce the observed histogram, demonstrating that the
statistic may not be sensitive to the scales. We simulated
a seismic catalog using a 3D version of the ETAS model
[2] that explicitely includes the scale of each mainshock
rupture length lr(m) = 0.02 × 100.5m in the spatial af-
tershock decay distribution with distance d according to
P (d) ∼ (l (m) + d)−(1+µ) and initiated the catalog with

1

a Landers-like M 7.3 mainshock. We used the parameters
(b = α = 1, p = 1.1, c = 0.0001, k = 0.0022, µ = 2, back-
ground=5.0 per day in a 700km by 700km window). We
show that the same analysis of data generated with after-
shock zone scaling leads to an apparent power law that
shows no sign of the aftershock zone scale lr ∼ 90km.

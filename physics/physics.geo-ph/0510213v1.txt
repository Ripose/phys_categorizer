We report a similarity of ﬂuctuations in equilibrium critical phenomena and non-equilibrium
systems, which is based on the concept of natural time. The world-wide seismicity as well as
that of San Andreas fault system and Japan are analyzed. An order parameter is chosen and its
ﬂuctuations relative to the standard deviation of the distribution are studied. We ﬁnd that the scaled
distributions fall on the same curve, which interestingly exhibits, over four orders of magnitude,
features similar to those in several equilibrium critical phenomena ( e.g., 2D Ising model) as well as
in non-equilibrium systems (e.g., 3D turbulent ﬂow).

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, a great interest has been focused on the ﬂuc-
tuations of correlated systems in general and of critical
systems in particular[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Bramwell,
Holdsworth and Pinton (BHP)[1], in an experiment of a
closed turbulent ﬂow, found that the (normalized) prob-
ability distribution function (PDF) of the power ﬂuctu-
ations has the same functional form as that of the mag-
netization (M ) of the ﬁnite-size 2D (two-dimensional)
XY equilibrium model in the critical region below the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature (Magnetic or-
dering is then described by the order parameter M ). The
normalized PDF, denoted by P (m), is deﬁned by intro-
ducing the reduced magnetization[1] m = (M − hM i)/σ,
where hM i denotes the mean and σ the standard devia-
tion. For both systems, BHP found that while the high
end (m > 0) of the distribution has[1] a Gaussian shape
the asymptote of which was later clariﬁed[3] to have a
double exponential form, a distinctive exponential tail
appears towards the low end (m < 0) of the distribution.
The latter tail, which will be hereafter simply called, for
the sake of convenience, “exponential tail”, provides the
main region of interest[1], since it shows that the prob-
ability for a rare ﬂuctuation, e.g., of greater than six
standard deviations from the mean, is almost ﬁve orders
of magnitude higher than in the Gaussian case. Subse-
quent independent simulations [2, 3, 4, 8, 9] showed that
a variety of highly correlated (non equilibrium as well as
equilibrium) systems, under certain conditions, exhibit
approximately the “exponential tail”.

Earthquakes do exhibit complex correlations in space,
time and magnitude, e.g.
[10, 11, 12]. It has been re-
peatedly proposed (see Ref.[13] and references therein)
that the occurrence of earthquakes (cf. mainshocks)

∗Published in Physical Review E 72, 041103 (2005).
†Electronic address: pvaro@otenet.gr

can be considered as a critical point (second-order phase
change), but alternative models based on ﬁrst-order
phase transitions have been also forwarded which are
probably more applicable, see Ref.[14] and references
therein. (Such a diversity also exists for the brittle rup-
ture which is a phenomenon closely related to earth-
quakes. Buchel and Sethna[15] have associated brittle
rupture with a ﬁrst-order transition and a similar view
has been also expressed in Refs.[16, 17]. On the other
hand, Gluzman and Sornette[18] later suggested that
it is analogous to a critical point phenomenon.) Both
approaches lead to scaling laws or power-law distribu-
tions for the dynamical variables (second-order transition
demonstrate scaling near a critical point, whereas ﬁrst-
order transitions demonstrate scaling when the range of
interactions is large (mean-ﬁeld condition), as is the case
with elastic interactions[14]). However, the question on
whether earthquakes exhibit an “exponential tail”, has
not yet been clariﬁed. This might be due to the major
diﬃculty of choosing an order parameter in the case of
earthquakes(EQs). Following the wording of Ref.[19], we
note that in general such a choice is an art, since usu-
ally it’s a new phase which we do not understand yet,
and guessing the order parameter is a piece of ﬁguring
out what’s going on. The scope of the present paper
is twofold: to propose an order parameter for the case
of EQs and then examine whether an “exponential tail”
appears. We ﬁnd that our scope is achieved only if we
analyze the series of earthquakes in the natural time-
domain[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

In order to serve the aforementioned scope, the present
paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we explain
how the power spectrum of the seismicity in natural time
can be obtained. An order parameter for EQs is proposed
in Section III. In the light of this proposal, and without
using any adjustable parameter, we show in Section IV
that the normalized distribution of the long term seismic-
ity for diﬀerent seismic areas fall on a universal curve. It
consists of two segments the one of which exhibits the
“exponential tail”. Interestingly, a further investigation

of the latter segment in Section V, reveals that it is sim-
ilar to that observed in several equilibrium critical phe-
nomena (e.g., 2D Ising, 3D Ising) and in non-equilibrium
systems (e.g., 3D turbulent ﬂow). A brief discussion fol-
lows in Section VI, while Section VII summarizes our
main conclusions. Two Appendices provide clariﬁcations
on some points discussed in the main text.

II. THE SEISMICITY IN NATURAL TIME

In a time series consisting of N events, the natural time
χk = k/N serves as an index[20, 21] for the occurrence
of the k-th event. It is, therefore, smaller than, or equal
to, unity. For the analysis of seismicity, the evolution of
the pair (χk, Ek) is considered[20, 22, 30, 31], where Ek
denotes the seismic energy released during the k-th event
see Fig.1 (cf. This energy -which is itself proportional to
the seismic moment M0 and hence we can use in the verti-
cal axis of Fig.1(b) either Ek or (M0)k is related[29] to the
magnitude M through E ∝ 10cM, where c is a constant
around 1.5). The following continuous function F (ω)
was introduced[20, 21, 22]: F (ω) =
where ω = 2πφ, and φ stands for the natural frequency.

For a Seismic Electric Signals (SES) activity, which is
a sequence of low frequency (≤ 1 Hz) electric pulses emit-
ted when the stress in the focal area approaches[28, 32]
a critical value, we have shown (for details see Ref.[20],
see also [21]) that the following relation holds[20, 21, 22]

Π(ω) =

5ω2 −

6 cos ω

.

(2)

We focus on the properties of Π(ω) or Π(φ) for natural
frequencies φ less than 0.5, since in this range of φ, Π(ω)
or Π(φ) reduces[20, 21, 22, 30] to a characteristic func-
tion for the probability distribution pk in the context of
probability theory. According to the probability theory,
the moments of a distribution and hence the distribution
itself can be approximately determined once the behavior
of the characteristic function of the distribution is known
around zero. For ω → 0, Eq.(2) leads to[20, 21, 30]:

Π(ω) ≈ 1 − 0.07ω2

which reﬂects (see Appendix A) that the variance of χ is
given by:

κ1 = hχ2i − hχi2 = 0.07.

In Section IV, we will investigate whether Eq.(2) holds
for EQs.

III. THE ORDER PARAMETER PROPOSED

We now proceed to choose the order parameter, as-
suming that a mainshock may be considered as the new
phase. We take advantage of the experimental fact[28]
that several hours to a few months before a mainshock
an SES activity is recorded, and focus our attention on
the evolution of the seismicity (in the candidate area)
during the period from the SES detection until the main-
shock. If we set the natural time for the seismicity zero
at the initiation of the concerned SES activity, we form
time series of seismic events in natural time (see Fig.1)
for various time windows as the number N of consecutive
(small) EQs increases. When computing Π(φ) (as well as
κ1, see below) for each of the time windows, we ﬁnd that,
in the range 0 < φ ≤ 0.5, it approaches, as N increases
from 6 to some value less than (or equal to) 40, to that
given by Eq.(2) (or the κ1-value becomes equal to 0.07,
see Eq.(4)). The coincidence occurs only a few hours to
a few days before the mainshock. (In simple words, be-
fore a mainshock a sequence of earthquakes occurs, which
obeys Eq.(2) and this process will be called single cor-
related process.) When the mainshock occurs (the new
phase), Π(φ) abruptly increases to approximately unity
(for details see Ref.[29]) and κ1 becomes almost zero.
This can be visualized in the example depicted in Fig.2,
where we plot the κ1-value versus the number of EQs af-
ter the SES detection on April 18, 1995 (see Refs.[21, 28])
until the occurrence of the M=6.6 mainshock on May
13, 1995 at 40.2oN, 21.7oE. This ﬁgure shows that the
κ1-value becomes κ1 ≈ 0.07 after the 11th EQ (see also
Ref.[29]), while upon the mainshock the κ1-value abruptly

decreases to κ1 ≈ 9 × 10−
veriﬁed[20, 22] for several major EQs and points to the
conclusion that Π(φ) for small φ, or κ1, could be consid-
ered as an order parameter.

IV. UNIVERSAL CURVE FOR SEISMICITY

The properties of the power spectrum for the long term
seismicities in natural time can be studied by means of
the following procedure: First, calculation of Π(φ) was
made for an event taking time windows from 6 to 40 con-
secutive events (for the reasons explained in Section III;
the choice of the precise value of the upper limit, up to
100 or so, is not found decisive[20, 22, 31]). And second,
this process was performed for all the events by scanning
the whole catalogue. The following data from two dif-
ferent areas, i.e., San Andreas fault system and Japan,
have been analyzed: First, the EQs that occurred dur-
ing the period 1973-2003 within the area N 37
114 us-
ing the Southern California Earthquake catalogue (here-
after called SCEC). Second, the EQs within N 46
25 E146
125
for the period 1967-2003 using the Japan Meteorologi-
cal Agency catalogue (hereafter simply called “Japan”).
The thresholds M≥2.0 and M≥3.5 have been considered
for SCEC and Japan, respectively, for the sake of data

32 W 122

completeness[29]. By plotting for a given value of φ the
observed probability P [Π(φ)] versus Π(φ) (two such ex-
amples are given in Figs.3(a) and 3(b) for φ = 0.05 and
φ = 0.4, respectively), we ﬁnd that a local maximum
occurs at a value of Π(φ) hereafter called Πp(φ) (see
also Appendix B). This lies very close (see Fig.3(c)) to
the value Πth(φ) obtained theoretically, i.e., estimated
from Eq.(2). The validity of Eq.(2) for various φ-values,
in the range 0 < φ ≤ 0.5, can be now visualized in
Fig.3(d), where we see that Πp(φ)-values versus φ for
both SCEC and Japan do not diﬀer by more than 1%
from the Πth(φ)-values (cf. this diﬀerence is more or less
comparable to the estimation error of Πp(φ), for details
see Appendix B).
We now plot,

in Fig.4, the quantity σP (X) versus
(X − hXi)/σ where X stands for Π(φ) and hΠ(φ)i and
σ refer to the mean value and the standard deviation
of Π(φ) (recall that the calculations should be done for
small φ-values, e.g., φ=0.05, since we assume here φ → 0,
for the reasons explained in Section II). One could alter-
natively plot σκ1 P (κ1) versus (hκ1i−κ1)/σκ1 , where hκ1i
and σκ1 now refer to the mean value and the standard
deviation of κ1. The results in Fig. 4, for both areas,
fall on the same curve. This log-linear plot clearly con-
sists of two segments: The segment to the left shows a
decrease of P (X) almost by ﬁve orders of magnitude,
while the upper right segment has an almost constant
P (X) (Obviously, the latter segment deviates from the
general behavior of the BHP distribution -as it was sum-
marized in Section I- but from thereon we put emphasis
on the left segment since our main interest here concerns
the “exponential tail”). The feature of this plot is strik-
ingly reminiscent of the one obtained by Bak et al.[10]
(see their Fig. 4) on diﬀerent grounds, using EQs in
California only. More precisely, they measured PS,l(T ),
the distribution of waiting times T , between EQs occur-
ring within range l whose magnitudes are greater than
bld
M ≡ log S. They then plotted T αPS,l(T ) versus T S−
and found that, for a suitable choice of the exponent α
(i.e., α = 1), the Gutenberg-Richter law exponent b (i.e.,
b=1) and the spatial dimension d (i.e., fractal dimension
d = 1.2) all the data collapse onto a single curve which
is similar to that of Fig.4. Recall, however, that Fig.4
was obtained here without considering at all the wait-
ing time distribution and without the suitable choice of
any parameter. After a further inspection of Fig.4, the
following points have been clariﬁed:

First, the rapidly decaying part (i.e., the left segment),
which is consistent with an almost exponential decay-
ing function over almost four orders of magnitude, re-
mains practically unchanged, upon randomizing the data
(“shuﬄing”[25]).
(Some changes do occur in the right
part, associated with aftershocks, see also below.) This
can be seen in the inset of Fig. 4, where for the sake
of clarity only the results from the data of Japan (the
original as well as the “shuﬄed” ones) are depicted.

Second, the feature of the plot of Fig. 4 is not al-
tered upon changing either the seismic region or the time-

3

period (provided that the latter does not include after-
shocks only, see below). As an example, Fig.5(b) shows
that three diﬀerent regions A, B, C in Japan (depicted
in Fig.5(a)), as well as the whole Japan, result in almost
identical plots.

Third, the “upturn branch” in the upper right part of
It dis-
Fig. 4 arises from the presence of aftershocks.
appears (see the crosses in Fig. 6) when, in Japan, for
example, we delete the EQs with M≤5.7 (and hence dras-
tically reduce the number of aftershocks), but it does not,
when deleting EQs with smaller threshold, i.e., M<4.0;
the latter can be also visualized in the SCEC example
of Fig. 6, where we give the results for M≥4.0 (cf. this
threshold still allows the presence of a reasonable number
of aftershocks).

Fourth,

if we consider the relevant results for the
worldwide seismicity (WWS) by taking a large magni-
tude threshold, i.e., M>5.7 (so that for the data to be
complete[29]), we ﬁnd (see Fig.6 that will be further dis-
cussed below) that they fall onto the same curve with the
results of both Japan and SCEC.

V. DOES A UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOUR EXIST
FOR DIVERSE SYSTEMS?

We now compare in Fig.6 the aforementioned re-
sults of seismicity with those obtained in some equi-
librium critical systems (e.g., see Ref.[8]). We ﬁrst re-
call that the PDF in the critical regime depends on
K = 1/T and the length L through a scaling variable
s ≡ L1/ν(K − Kc)/Kc, where Kc = 1/Tc and Tc de-
notes the critical temperature (the quantity sν provides
the ratio of the lattice size and the correlation length
at K).
In Fig. 6, we include numerical results of the
2D Ising model for s = 8.72(L = 128, K = 0.4707) and
s = 17.44(L = 256, K = 0.4707). Here, X stands for M .
These s-values were intentionally selected, because[8] for
s ≥ 8.72 for the 2D Ising model, the P (m, s)’s of a num-
ber of critical models (i.e., 2D XY, 2D Ising, 3D Ising, 2D
three-state Potts) share the same form (up to a constant
factor of s), which interestingly exhibits an exponential-
like left-tail (m < 0). An inspection of Fig.6 shows that
our 2D Ising results almost coincide (cf. this can be safely
checked only for the left segment, i.e., m < 0) with those
of seismicity, i.e., Japan, SCEC and WWS (cf. Some dis-
parity which appears in the upper right part of SCEC
only, might be attributed to the selection of the magni-
tude threshold for seismicity, recall the third point men-
tioned in Section IV). This coincidence (which seems to
be better for s = 17.44) reveals that the seismicity, ir-
respective of the seismic area we consider, exhibits -over
four orders of magnitude- ﬂuctuations of the order pa-
rameter similar to those in several critical systems as well
as in 3D turbulent ﬂow.

VI. DISCUSSION

It is of interest to see how the scaled distributions look
like in the frame of the present analysis, if one generates
surrogate data either by means of a simple Poisson model
or by the Gutenberg-Richter law and compare the results
to those deduced from actual seismicity data.

In Fig.7, we present the linear-linear plot (Fig. 7(a))
as well as the log-linear plot (Fig. 7(b)) of σP (X) ver-
sus (X − hXi)/σ where X stands for Π(φ) for φ ≈ 0,
for surrogate data of EQs for which their (Mo)k obey a
simple Poisson rule for various mean values λ lying be-
tween 5 and 200. In the same ﬁgure we insert the results
for Japan (M ≥ 3.5) and SCEC (M ≥ 2.0) already dis-
cussed in Fig.4. Although we ﬁnd that upon decreasing
λ the surrogate data move closer to the real data, how-
ever a satisfactory agreement between them cannot be
supported.

In Fig. 8 we repeat the procedure followed in Fig. 7,
but now the surrogate data are produced on the basis
of the Gutenberg-Richter law, i.e., that the (cumulative)
number of EQs with magnitude greater than M (occur-
ring in a speciﬁed region and time) is given by

It is currently considered[14] that b is generally a con-
stant varying only slightly from region to region being
approximately in the range 0.8 ≤ b ≤ 1.2. For Japan
and SCEC we ﬁnd on the basis of Eq.(5) b ≈ 1.05. Note
that in Fig.8, surrogate data are intentionally produced
for a variety of b values in the range b = 0.5 to 2.0.
An inspection of this ﬁgure leads to the following con-
clusions: First, the curves of the surrogate data marked
with b = 0.5 to b = 0.9 signiﬁcantly diﬀer from that of the
real data. Second, for b-values larger than 1 and smaller
than 1.4, the curves of the surrogate data have a general
feature more or less similar to the curve of the real data.
However, none of these b-values in the surrogate data can
lead to a curve coinciding to the one obtained from the
real data.

In other words, the scaled distribution, deduced within
the frame of the present analysis, reveals for the real
data an extra complexity when compared to the surro-
gate data even if the latter are produced with b-values
comparable to the experimental ones.

4

First, the scaled distributions of diﬀerent seismic areas
(as well as that of the world wide seismicity) fall on the
same curve (universal).

Second, this curve exhibits an “exponential tail” form
similar to that observed in certain non-equilibrium sys-
tems (e.g., 3D turbulent ﬂow) as well as in several(e.g.,
2D Ising, 3D Ising, 2D XY) equilibrium critical phenom-
ena.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The main conclusions could be summarized as follows:
(1)The analysis of the seismicity in the natural time-
domain reveals that Π(φ) (for small φ) or κ1, may be
considered as an order parameter.

(2)If we study the order parameter ﬂuctuations relative
to the standard deviation of its distribution, the following
two facts emerge (without making use of any adjustable
parameter):

The calculation of Π(φ) was made, as mentioned in
Section IV, for an event taking time windows from 6 to
40 consecutive events and this process was performed for
all the events by scanning the whole catalogue. This
procedure resulted in the calculation, for each φ-value
and each catalogue, of more than 106 Π(φ)-values, whose
probability density function (PDF) was determined by
using the computer code histogram of Ref.[34] with a
number of bins proportional to N 1/3, where N is the

5

number of Π(φ)-values (cf. this point, i.e., that the num-
ber of bins should be proportional to N 1/3, is discussed
in Ref. [35]). This method resulted in the PDFs shown
in Fig.9 as well as in those depicted in Figs.3(a),3(b),
4, 5(b), and 6. Due to the intrinsic ﬂuctuations of the
values of the PDF (because N is still ﬁnite), a direct
determination of the value Πp(φ) where the PDF maxi-
mizes, just by simply taking the maximum value of the
calculated PDF, may lead to erroneous values of Πp(φ).
One should consider the general trend of the PDF as a
whole, which can deﬁnitely show a more accurate and
stable value of Πp(φ). Thus, the procedure we applied
for the determination of Πp(φ) was as follows: For each
φ-value, a region [a, b] around the maximum was se-
lected (examples are shown in Figs.9(a) and (b)) and
then a cubic polynomial, p(x) = a + bx + cx2 + dx3,
(Close
was used to ﬁt the PDF values in this region.

enough to the maximum, a parabolic ﬁt could be also
max|(x − xmax)2/2, but
good since f (x) = fmax − |f
in view of the PDF asymmetry the cubic polynomial
used, provides a better approximation in the whole re-
gion [a, b].) The value of Πp(φ) was determined through
the direct maximization of this cubic polynomial,
i.e,
. The values of Πp(φ) shown in
Πp(φ) = −
Fig.3(c) have been obtained by means of such a proce-
dure. Finally, we note that, due to the ﬁtting procedure
involved and the relative arbitrariness in the deﬁnition of
[a,b], the estimation error of Πp(φ) is more or less com-
parable to its percentage deviation from Πth(φ), depicted
in Fig.3(d). Thus, we can state that Πp(φ) and Πth(φ)
are experimentally indistinguishable, which strengthens
the statement that Eq.(2) -which has been used for esti-
mating Πth(φ)- holds for EQs.

FIG. 1: How a series of seismic events in conventional time
(a) is read in the natural time (b). This example refers to
the ﬁrst 11 small earthquakes (cf. the month/date is marked
on the horizontal axis in (a)) that occurred after the SES ac-
tivity recorded on April 18,1995 and preceded the mainshock
(M=6.6) of May 13,1995.

FIG. 3:
(Color online) Validity of Eq.(2) for SCEC and
Japan. We ﬁrst determine (see also Appendix B) for
SCEC(circles) and Japan(crosses), for each φ-value, the value
Πp(φ) at which P [Π(φ)] maximizes. Two such examples are
shown in (a) and (b) for φ = 0.05 and φ = 0.4, respec-
tively.
In (c), we plot the resulting Πp(φ) values versus φ
for SCEC(circles) and Japan(crosses); the solid line corre-
sponds to Eq.(2). The percentage diﬀerence between Πp(φ)
and Πth(φ) (obtained from Eq.(2)) is shown in (d).

Furthermore, the dotted curve shows the results obtained for
the 2D XY model (with[33] inverse Kosterlitz-Thouless tran-
sition temperature KKT ≈ 1.2) (X =

for L = 10(N = 100) which has been shown[1] to describe the
experimental results for 3D turbulent ﬂow. The results of the
2D Ising model K = 0.4707 (while Kc ≈ 0.4407), either for
L = 128(dashed) or L = 256(solid line), are also plotted.

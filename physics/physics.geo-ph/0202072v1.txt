regions to the TEC response to the solar ﬂares using data
from the international GPS network

Abstract

This paper proposes a new method for estimating the contribution from diﬀerent
ionospheric regions to the response of total electron content variations to the solar ﬂare,
based on data from the international network of two-frequency multichannel receivers
of the navigation GPS system. The method uses the eﬀect of partial shadowing of
the atmosphere by the terrestrial globe. The study of the solar ﬂare inﬂuence on the
atmosphere uses GPS stations located near the boundary of the shadow on the ground
in the nightside hemisphere. The beams between the satellite-borne transmitter and the
receiver on the ground for these stations pass partially through the atmosphere lying
in the region of total shadow and partially through the illuminated atmosphere. The
analysis of the ionospheric eﬀect of a powerful solar ﬂare of class X5.7/3B that was
recorded on July 14, 2000 (10:24 UT, N22W07) in quiet geomagnetic conditions (Dst =
-10 nT) has shown that about 20% of the TEC increase correspond to the ionospheric
region lying below 100 km, about 5% refer to the ionospheric E-region (100-140 km),
about 30% correspond to the ionospheric F1-region (140-200 km), and about 30% to
regions lying above 300 km.

1 Introduction

The enhancement of X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) emission that is observed during chromospheric ﬂares on
the Sun immediately causes an increase in electron density in the ionosphere. These density variations are
diﬀerent for diﬀerent altitudes and are called Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances, SID (Davies,1990; Donnelly,
1969). SIDs are generally recorded as the short wave fadeout, SWF (Stonehocker, 1970), sudden phase
anomaly, SPA (Ohshio, 1971), sudden frequency deviation, SFD (Donnelly, 1971; Liu et al., 1996), sudden
cosmic noise absorption, SCNA (Deshpande and Mitra, 1972), sudden enhancement/decrease of atmospher-
ics, SES (Sao et al., 1970). Much research is devoted to SID studies, among them a number of thorough
reviews (Mitra, 1974; Davies, 1990).

Highly informative technique is the method of Incoherent Scatter (IS). The Millstone Hill IS facility
recorded a powerful ﬂare on August 7, 1972 (Mendillo and Evans, 1974a). The measurements were made in
the height range from 125 to 1200 km. The increase of local electron density Ne made up 100% at 125 km
altitude and 60% at 200 km.

Using the IS method Thome and Wagner (1971) obtained important evidence of the height distribution
of the increase in Ne at the time of the May 21 and 23, 1967 ﬂares. A signiﬁcant increase of Ne was recorded
in the E-region, up to 200%, which gradually decreases in the F-region with the increasing height, down to
10-30%, and remains distinguishable up to 300 km. The earliest increase of Ne begins in the E-region, and
at higher altitudes it is observed with a delay which is particularly pronounced at F-region heights.

A sudden increase in total electron content (TEC) can be measured using continuously operating radio
beacons installed on geostationary satellites. On August 7, 1972, Mendillo et al. (1974b) were the ﬁrst to
make an attempt to carry out global observations of the solar ﬂare using 17 stations in North America,
Europe, and Africa. The observations covered an area, the boundaries of which were separated by 70◦ in
latitude and by 10 hours in local time. For diﬀerent stations, the absolute value of the TEC increase ∆I

varies from 1.8 · 1016 to 8.6 · 1016el · m−2, which corresponds to 15-30% of the TEC. Investigations revealed
a latitudinal dependence of the TEC increase value. At low latitudes, it was higher compared with high
latitudes. Besides, the authors point out the absence of a connection between the TEC increase value and
the solar zenith angle.

The advent and evolution of a Global Positioning System (GPS) and also the creation on its basis of
widely branched networks of GPS stations (at least 900 sites at the August of 2001, the data from which are
placed on the Internet) opened up a new era in remote ionospheric sensing. High-precision measurements
of the TEC along the line-of-sight (LOS) between the receiver on the ground and transmitters on the GPS
system satellites covering the reception zone are made using two-frequency multichannel receivers of the
GPS system at almost any point of the globe and at any time simultaneously at two coherently coupled
frequencies f1 = 1575.42 MHz and f2 = 1227.60 MHz.

The sensitivity of phase measurements in the GPS system is suﬃcient for detecting irregularities with an
amplitude of up to 103 − 104 of the diurnal TEC variation. This makes it possible to formulate the problem
of detecting ionospheric disturbances from diﬀerent sources of artiﬁcial and natural origins. The TEC unit
(TECU) which is equal to 1016 el · m−2 and is commonly accepted in the literature, will be used throughout
the text.

Afraimovich (2000a); Afraimovich et al.

(2000b, 2001a,b) developed a novel technology of a global
detection of ionospheric eﬀects from solar ﬂares and presented data from ﬁrst GPS measurements of global
response of the ionosphere to powerful impulsive ﬂares of July 29, 1999, and December 28, 1999. Authors
found that ﬂuctuations of TEC are coherent for all stations on the dayside of the Earth. The time proﬁle of
TEC responses is similar to the time behavior of hard X-ray emission variations during ﬂares in the energy
range 25-35 keV if the relaxation time of electron density disturbances in the ionosphere of order 50-100 s is
introduced. No such eﬀect on the nightside of the Earth has been detected yet.

Afraimovich et al. (2001c) and Leonovich et al. (2001) suggested a technique for estimating the iono-
spheric response to weak solar ﬂares (of X-ray class C). They obtained a dependence of the ionospheric TEC
increase amplitude (during the solar ﬂare) on the ﬂare location on the Sun (on the central meridian distance,
CMD). For ﬂares lying nearer to the disk center (CMD < 40◦), an empirical dependence of the ionospheric
TEC increase amplitude on the peak power of solar ﬂares in the X-ray range was obtained (using data from
the geostationary GOES-10 satellite).

This paper is a logical continuation of the series of our publications (Afraimovich, 2000a; Afraimovich et
al., 2000b, 2001a,b,c, Leonovich et al., 2001) devoted to the study of ionospheric eﬀects of solar ﬂares, based
on data from the international GPS network.

A limitation of the GPS method is that its results have an integral character, as a consequence of which
from measurements at a single site it is impossible to determine which ionospheric region makes the main
contribution to the TEC variation. The objective of this study is to develop a method which would help
overcome (at least partially) this problem.

2 Method of determining the shadow altitude h0 over

the ground

The method uses the eﬀect of partial ”shadowing” of the atmosphere by the terrestrial globe. Direct beams
of solar ionizing radiation from the ﬂare do not penetrate the region of the Earths total shadow. GPS stations
located near the shadow boundary on the ground in the nightside hemisphere are used to investigate the
solar ﬂare inﬂuence on the ionosphere. The LOS for these stations pass partially through the atmosphere
lying in the total shadow region, and partially through the illuminated atmosphere. The altitude over the
ground at which the LOS intersects the boundary of the total shadow cone, will be referred to as the shadow
altitude h0.

Fig. 1 schematically represents the formation of the cone of the Earths total shadow (not to scale) in the
geocentric solar-ecliptic coordinate system (GSE): the axis Z is directed to a north perpendicularly planes
of an ecliptic, the axis X - on the Sun, the axis Y is directed perpendiculary to these axes. For deﬁnition of
the shadow altitude h0 it is necessary to know coordinates of a cross point C of the LOS and the shadow
boundary.

The primary data are the geographical coordinates of station GPS on the Earth (Fig.1; a point P):
an elevation angle and azimuth of LOS on a satellite GPS, toward the north clockwise, for the time (UT)
corresponding to the phase of solar ﬂare maximum in the X-ray range. These coordinates are converted to

the Cartesian coordinate system where the Cartesian coordinates of the GPS station on the ground and the
coordinates of the subionospheric point (at 300 km altitude) are calculated. Next, we use the geocentric
solar-ecliptic coordinate system following the technique reported by Sergeev and Tsyganenko (1980). To
determine the coordinates of the point C we solve a system of equations: the equation of cone (of total
shadow), and the equation of a straight line (LOS) speciﬁed parametrically. After that, from the resulting
point C we drop a perpendicular to the ground and calculate its length (Fig. 1, line h0). The value of h0,
thus obtained, is just the shadow altitude.

3 Method of determining the TEC increase in the
ionosphere using data from the global GPS net work

This paper exempliﬁes an analysis of the ionospheric eﬀect of a powerful solar ﬂare of class X5.7/3B recorded
on July 14, 2000 (10:24 UT, N22W07) under quiet geomagnetic conditions (Dst = -10 nT). The time proﬁle
of soft X-ray emission in the range 1-8 ˚A (GOES-10 data) at the time of the ﬂare is presented in Fig. 2a.

To determine the TEC increase in the ionosphere we used the data from the international GPS network.
The GPS technology provides a means of estimating the TEC variations I0(t) on the basis of TEC phase
measurements made with each of the spatially separated two-frequency GPS receivers using the formula
(Calais and Minster, 1996):

I0(t) =

[(L1λ1 − L2λ2) + const + nL],

where L1λ1 and L2λ2 are the increments of the radio signal phase path caused by the phase delay in
the ionosphere (m); L1 and L2 stand for the number of complete phase rotations, and λ1 and λ2 are the
wavelengths (m) for the frequencies f1 and f2, respectively; const is some unknown initial phase path (m);
and nL is the error in determining the phase path (m).

Input data used in the analysis include series of the oblique value of TEC I0(t), as well as corresponding
series of elevations θ and azimuths of LOS to the satellite. These parameters are calculated using our
developed CONVTEC program to convert standard (for the GPS system) RINEX-ﬁles received via the
Input series of TEC I0(t) are converted to the vertical value following a well-known technique

Variations of the regular ionosphere, and also trends introduced by the motion of the satellite are elim-
inated using the procedure of removing the trend deﬁned as a polynomial of the third order on a given
temporary interval.

Figs. 2b and 2d present the typical time dependencies of the vertical TEC I(t) for sites GPS WDLM
(PRN02, shadow altitude h0 = 17 km) and LEEP (PRN07, shadow altitude h0 = 586 km). Time dependen-
cies of the TEC ∆I(t) response, with the trend removed for these series, are presented in Figs. 2c and 2e,
respectively.

4 Results and discussion

The TEC response to the solar ﬂare was analyzed for 45 GPS stations. Detailed information about the GPS
stations and analysis results is summarized in Table 1: names of GPS receiving stations (Site), number of
the GPS satellite from which the signal is received (PRN), shadow altitude above the ground (h0), absolute
increase of TEC ∆I, relative increase of TEC (∆I(t)/∆I00(t), and geographical coordinates of GPS stations
(latitude, longitude). The increase of TEC ∆I00 corresponds to the amplitude of the TEC increase measured
at the station lying at the shadow boundary on the ground (h0 = 0).

Fig. 3b illustrates examples of time dependencies of the TEC ∆I0 response for LOS to the satellite which
intersect the boundary of the shadow cone at diﬀerent heights h0 during the solar ﬂare of July 14, 2000.
Fig. 3b (left) presents the values of these altitudes, and (right) the names of corresponding stations. For a

better visualization, the dependencies are drawn by lines of a diﬀerent thickness. It should be noted that
the response remains pronounced when the shadow altitude exceeds signiﬁcantly the electron density peak
height in the ionosphere. For station GUAM (PRN26, height of the shadow boundary h0 = 885 km), the
response amplitude exceeds the background oscillation amplitude by more than a factor of 2.

It is evident from Fig. 3 that the wave phase (time of the response maximum) is diﬀerent at diﬀerent
altitudes h0. On the one hand, this phenomenon can be caused by the interference of the response with back-
ground ﬂuctuations; on the other, this can be due to the fact that at diﬀerent heights diﬀerent wavelengths
of ionizing radiation are observed, which, in turn, can have independent time characteristics.

The dependence of the absolute TEC increase on the altitude h0 for all the cases under consideration is
plotted in Fig. 4a. The dependence of the relative TEC increase ∆I(t)/∆I00 on the altitude h0 during the
solar ﬂare is shown as a percentage in Fig. 4b. The TEC increase ∆I00(t) corresponds to the amplitude of
the TEC increase measured at the station lying at the shadow boundary on the ground (h0 = 0).

Fig. 4b suggests that about 20% of the TEC increase correspond to the ionospheric region lying below
100 km, about 5% refer to the ionospheric E-region (100-140 km), about 30% correspond to the ionospheric
F1-region (140-200 km), and about 30% to regions lying above 300 km. We found that a rather signiﬁcant
contribution to the TEC increase is made by ionospheric regions lying above 300 km.

The estimate obtained is consistent with the ﬁndings reported by Mendillo and Evans (1974a); Mendillo
et al. (1974b). The authors of the cited references, based on investigating the electron density proﬁle in the
height range from 125 km to 1200 km using the IS method, concluded that about 40% of the TEC increase
during the powerful ﬂare on August 7, 1972, correspond to ionospheric regions lying above 300 km. However,
Thome and Wagner (1971), who used the IS method to investigate the ionospheric eﬀects from two others
powerful solar ﬂares, pointed out that an increase in electron density associated with the solar ﬂare was
observable to 300 km altitude only. This diﬀerence can be explained by the fact that each particular solar
ﬂare is a unique event which is characterized by its own spectrum and dynamics in the ﬂare process.

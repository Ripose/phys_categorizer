Viscosity of high crystal content melts: dependence on solid fraction
Antonio Costa
Centre for Environmental and Geophysical Flows, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol

The rheological properties of suspensions containing high solid
fractions are investigated. Attention is focused on viscosity of sil-
icate and magmatic melt systems. A general empirical equation
which describes the relative viscosity of suspensions as a function
of suspended solid fraction is proposed. In the limit of very dilute
solid concentrations it reduces to the Einstein equation. The pro-
posed relationship is satisfactorily applied to reproduce available
experimental data relative to silicate melts. Moreover, the extrap-
olation of the model to very high concentrations is compared with
experimental observations on partially-melted granite.

1. Introduction

The rheology of suspensions with high solid fraction is of inter-
est in many ﬁelds, from industry [Liu, 2000] to magma transport
processes [Lejeune and Richet, 1995]. Regarding magma rheology
at high solid fractions, there is little reliable experimental data about
crystal-content viscosity dependence, even though magma viscosity
is a fundamental property governing mass transport in volcanolog-
ical processes. This is mainly due to the difﬁculty in performing
experiments on magma containing crystals, as well as to the difﬁ-
culty in interpreting the results because of the numerous factors that
inﬂuence the rheology of partially crystallised magma [Pinkerton
and Stevenson, 1992; Lejeune and Richet, 1995; Saar et al., 2001].
However, since magma viscosity controls magma transport, when
modelling many volcanic processes (e.g. dome growth) there is a
need to estimate crystal-content viscosity dependence even in the
limit of very high crystal content where no experimental observa-
tions are available [see e.g. Melnik and Sparks, 1999, 2002].
In the ﬁrst part of this paper I shortly review the most common
parameterisations proposed for the rheology of concentrated sus-
pensions, then I propose a new equation describing the relative vis-
cosity as function of the solid content. Such an equation is able
to reproduce the available experimental data, reducing to the well
established relationships for dilute suspensions. Finally, I apply the
proposed parameterisation to ﬁt data on silicate melts [Lejeune and
Richet, 1995] and to describe the trend of viscosity of partially-
melted granite [van der Molen and Paterson, 1979].

2. Viscosity of very concentrated suspensions

One century ago Einstein [1906] predicted that in the case of a
very diluted suspension of solid spherical non-interacting particles,
the relative viscosity η (deﬁned as the ratio of suspension viscosity
on that of the suspending medium) is

η = (1 + Bφ)

(1)

where φ is the volume fraction of particles (deﬁned as the ratio of
volume occupied by particles on total volume of suspension), and
B is the Einstein coefﬁcient with a theoretical value B = 2.5 [from

experiments for φ
0, it ranges from 1.5 to 5, Jeffrey and Acrivos,
1976]. Considering eq. (1) as a starting point, many rheologists
have attempted to ﬁnd a formula for the effective viscosity η in
terms of φ, i.e. η = η(φ). For spherical particles having different
sizes, Roscoe [1952] and independently Brinkmann [1952] showed
that (1) implies a relative viscosity given by:

η = (1

2.5

φ)−

−

In the derivation of eq.
(1) particle interactions are completely
neglected. In order to extend the validity of (2) to suspensions con-
taining a high concentration of spheres, Roscoe [1952] introduced
the concept of critical fraction φm at which incompressible solid
would prevent any ﬂow:

For spheres of equal size, the relative maximum packing density is

0.87 for a polydisperse random sphere packing, Kansal
[φm
(3) is an attempt to describe η in terms of φ
et al., 2002]. Eq.
starting from ﬁrst principles, but as it has been shown [Jeffrey and
Acrivos, 1976], no simple single functions (i.e. η = η(φ)) can exist
because suspended particles can be subjected to thermal, electrical
and hydrodynamic interactions and moreover particle shapes and
particle size distribution play an important role that cannot be easily
incorporated into a simple form. At present, there is no rigorous
theory [Hercynski and Pienkowska, 1980]. For these reasons any
proposed function that can ﬁt experimental data must contain ad-
justable parameters. For instance, a semi-empirical generalisation
of (3) due to Krieger and Dougherty [1959] is:

0 reduces to 1 + Bφ. In this way B can be
that in the limit φ
interpreted as an Einstein coefﬁcient. Actually, φ should be viewed
generally as an effective volume fraction [Quemada, 1998]. For
concentrated suspensions, no satisfactory theory comparable with
that for diluted concentrations exists [Jeffrey and Acrivos, 1976],
but a variety of empirical equations have been suggested for de-
scription of φ
η relationship [see e.g. Gay et al., 1969; Dabak
and Yucel, 1986; Liu, 2000]. All the proposed parameterisations for
concentrated suspensions assume that there is a critical solid frac-
tion φm at which the viscosity tends to be inﬁnite. From a physical
point of view it is instead natural to assume that when the solid
fraction reaches φm a rheological transition occurs from a regime
where the rheology is basically determined by the liquid phase to
a regime where the effect of crystals is predominant and the vis-
cosity values are much higher [Lejeune and Richet, 1995; van der
Molen and Paterson, 1979]. In the latter regime the rheology is more
complicated than in the ﬁrst one, the suspension becomes markedly
non-Newtonian exhibiting a yield stress and the liquid-solid system
can behave like a ﬂuid or a solid depending on the stress applied
on it. Only an effective viscosity value can be inferred for these
systems [van der Molen and Paterson, 1979]. Experimental results
obtained by Lejeune and Richet [1995] for crystal-bearing melts

clearly suggest this rheological transition.
Based on this idea, in order to reproduce this transition between the
two different rheological regimes, Melnik and Sparks [1999, 2002]
utilised the following parameterisation:

where θ0, ω and φ
are three adjustable parameters that must be

does not recover eq. (1).
Our purpose in the next section is to ﬁnd a more general φ
η
parameterisation that (i) describes the aforementioned rheological
transitions, (ii) is able to reproduce the few available data of vis-
cosity for high crystal content silicate melts [Lejeune and Richet,
1995], (iii) contains adjustable parameters easy to interpret from a
physical point of view, and (iv) in the limit of small φ reduces to the
equations valid for dilute systems.

where B is Einstein’s coefﬁcient (theoretically B = 2.5), α, β, γ
are three adjustable parameters (they should allow us to reproduce
a linear, an intermediate and an asymptotic behaviour) and F is a
general function which has a rapid asymptotic behaviour for large
φ whereas is linear as φ
0. As a general function we choose
F proportional to the error function, i.e. the integral of the Gaus-

where the argument of the error function must contain a term lin-
ear in φ and a non-linear term which permits a rapid saturation for
large φ and it is able to incorporate the non-linear corrections in the
intermediate range. The ﬁnal form we adopt is the following:

where 0 < α < 1. In this way, if it needs, the relative viscosity
can assume all the value from 1 to inﬁnity (see Figure 1 where re-
lationship (9) is shown for different parameter values). When the
argument of the function erf(x) is < 1 (i.e. as we can neglect terms
of the third order in the Taylor expansion), relationship (9) tends to:

A physical interpretation of the empirical parameters that appear
in eq. (9) can be obtained from the relationships written above and
from Figure 1. Concerning α, directly from (9) we can see that it
gives the maximum relative viscosity in the limit of high fraction
B/α. β and γ parameters indicate the
solid: ηmax
importance of non-linear effects in the argument of the erf(x) func-
tion. Figure 1 shows that β mainly controls the value of the critical
fraction φc (small β values correspond to smaller φc). From (12), it
is possible to impose for β an upper limit . 2 in order to maintain
within the typical range measured in experiments. Finally, from
B
∗
Figure 1 we can see that γ (here assumed to be greater than unity)
determines the curve slope between the two regimes (a measure
of the “rapidity” to reach the asymptotic viscosity) and hence the
width of the transition region. Generally, we assume that values of
all three parameters α, β and γ can be shear-dependent.

available, the most signiﬁcant being by Lejeune and Richet [1995].
In their experimental study, Lejeune and Richet [1995] measured
the viscosity of partially crystallised Mg3Al2Si3O12 and Li2Si2O5.
Crystals were well-rounded in the ﬁrst case while the second kind
of melt contained small ellipsoidal inclusions, but the observed rhe-
ological behaviour was qualitatively similar in both cases. Their
results suggest that the most important parameter in determining
melt viscosity is basically the crystal fraction, although other fac-
tors can inﬂuence the rheological behaviour.
As it is shown in Figure 2, the agreement between experimental
data of Lejeune and Richet [1995] and results given by best ﬁtting
(9) is excellent. Using the least square minimisation proce-
eq.
dure, in both cases we found very low χ2 values and a correlation
coefﬁcient practically equal to the unit which indicate the elevated
goodness of the ﬁts. Besides these results, the numerical solution
of eq. (11) for the estimation of the critical crystal fraction, with
the parameter values reported in Figure 2 furnishes φc
0.65 and
0.45 for Mg3Al2Si3O12 and Li2Si2O5 melts respectively. In
φc
the case of Li2Si2O5, ﬁtting results show that nonlinear terms are
more important with respect to Mg3Al2Si3O12 while the lower α
could reﬂect the higher zero crystal fraction melt viscosity. The
different behaviour of Li2Si2O5 melts could be due to the presence
of ellipsoidal particles formed during crystallisation (in the case of
Mg3Al2Si3O12 particles were well-rounded spherulites). Finally,
in the limit of φ
in (12)
remains practically equal to 2.5.
Notwithstanding the model showed a good performance, we must
stress its intrinsic limitations specially in describing natural systems
containing crystals of different shapes and sizes. With increasing
crystal fraction, the stress-strain rate relationship becomes increas-
ingly non-linear because of interactions between particles that cre-
ate a non-Newtonian behaviour that can be empirically described
in terms of an effective viscosity and of a yield strength. More-
over there are no reliable experimental results for φ greater than
0.7, hence values predicted by (9) in the high concentration limit
must be seen as extrapolations. For these reasons more experimen-
tal data of different melt-crystal systems for more thorough future
investigations and calibrations are necessary.

5. Application to melted rocks

In the case of natural systems, such as partially melted rocks, the
rheology is even more complicated because of the contemporary
inﬂuence of numerous parameters that control the viscosity [e.g.
Marsh, 1981; Pinkerton and Stevenson, 1992]. For magma we can
distinguish three rheological ranges:
the ﬁrst one for completely
melted rock, an intermediate range and the last in the range of very
low melt fraction [van der Molen and Paterson, 1979]. In the ﬁrst
interval, and at sufﬁciently low rates of strain, melted rock rheol-
ogy can be approximated to that of an ideal Newtonian ﬂuid with
viscosity dependent on chemical composition and temperature. In
the second interval, for φ . 50%, the system can be viewed as
a suspension of well separated crystals in a viscous melt. In the
low melt fraction regime, crystal interactions have a predominant
role that increases as the melt fraction decreases until solid-like be-
haviour is exhibited [van der Molen and Paterson, 1979]. For melted
rocks with high crystal percentage only a few experimental results
exist, the most signiﬁcant being those by van der Molen and Pa-
terson [1979] who investigated the deformation of partially-melted
granite with solid contents from 75% up to 95% at 800oC and 300
MPa conﬁning pressure. They inferred that the critical crystal frac-
tion discerning granular-framework-controlled ﬂow behaviour from
suspension-like behaviour is around 0.6-0.7. In a different study on
rheology of lavas, from the analysis of the overall phenocryst content
Marsh [1981] observed that for crystal volume fractions greater than
about 0.55 there should be a sharp rheological change that inhibits
lava to erupt. With increasing crystallinity the viscosity moderately
increases but when a critical solid content is reached, the viscosity
increases so rapid that over a short range of crystallinity the magma

5s−

behaves essentially as a solid. This should explain why lavas with
more than 55% phenocrysts are rare.
During their experiments, van der Molen and Paterson [1979]
recorded some complex stress-strain curves having in common a
generally sigmoidal shape, but in no case did they observe a steady
state behaviour. Moreover, in the plots of maximum differential
stress versus strain-rate they note only a low strain-rate dependence
(about a tenth of an ideal Newtonian ﬂuid). For all these reasons,
it is arduous to express their results in terms of “effective viscosi-
ties”. For a practical purpose, considering the results obtained at a
1) we deﬁne an “effective viscosity”
given strain-rate (e.g. 10−
as the ratio between the maximum differential stress and the strain-
rate. Keeping in mind these limitations, in order to make a semi-
quantitative comparison between the available experimental results
and eq.
(9), in Figure 3 we plotted relative viscosities deduced
from data of van der Molen and Paterson [1979] in the high crystal
fraction regime considering as an example a crystal-free ﬂuid vis-
cosity of 105 Pa s, and matched these values with relative viscosities
measured at lower solid content relative to data of Mg3Al2Si3O12
by Lejeune and Richet [1995] and some values by Thomas [1965]
reported in Pinkerton and Stevenson [1992]. Although we cannot
pretend to make an accurate ﬁt because of the heterogeneity and
limitations of the considered data, we can observe that over almost
the entire range of solid fraction, the model is able to reproduce
0.94)
the order of magnitude of all data with a good correlation (
and the curve shape hypothesised by van der Molen and Paterson
[1979]. Moreover, considering the parameters used to plot Figure 3
(α = 0.9995, i.e. ηmax = 1.8
1), the
×
numerical solution of (11) gives φc
0.55, in good agreement
with the values suggested by Marsh [1981] for the sudden change
of magma rheology.

fraction (squares). For the crystal-free ﬂuid viscosity at 800oC
and 300 MPa, we considered a value of µl = 105 Pa s. The
correlation coefﬁcient is 0.94.

6. Conclusion

A new general equation which correlates the relative viscosity
of suspensions as a function of suspended solid fraction valid for
all solid contents is proposed. The proposed relationship (i) is able
to accurately reproduce available data of viscosity for silicate melts
with low to high crystal contents, (ii) describes the rheological tran-
sition between two different regimes and (iii) contains adjustable
parameters easy to interpret from a physical point of view, and (iv)
in the limit of small solid fractions reduces to the well-known Ein-
stein equation. Extrapolation to the limit of very high concentrations
satisfactorily compares with experimental observations on partially-
melted granite, giving a critical transition value of solid fraction
around 55%, in good agreement with geological observations.

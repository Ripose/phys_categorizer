We analyzed eﬀects of elasticity on the dynamics of ﬂuids in porous media by studying a ﬂow
of a Maxwell ﬂuid in a tube, which oscillates longitudinally and is subject to oscillatory pressure
gradient. The present study investigates novelties brought about into the classic Biot’s theory
of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid by inclusion of non-Newtonian
eﬀects that are important, for example, for hydrocarbons. Using the time Fourier transform and
transforming the problem into the frequency domain, we calculated: (A) the dynamic permeability
and (B) the function F (κ) that measures the deviation from Poiseuille ﬂow friction as a function of
frequency parameter κ. This provides a more complete theory of ﬂow of Maxwell ﬂuid through the
longitudinally oscillating cylindrical tube with the oscillating pressure gradient, which has important
practical applications. This study has clearly shown transition from dissipative to elastic regime in
which sharp enhancements (resonances) of the ﬂow are found.

I. INTRODUCTION

A quantitative theory of propagation of elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid was formulated in the classic
papers by Biot [1]. One of the major ﬁndings of Biot’s work was that there was a breakdown in Poisseuille ﬂow above
a certain characteristic frequency

speciﬁc to the ﬂuid-saturated porous material. Biot theoretically studied this phenomenon by considering the ﬂow
of a viscous ﬂuid in a tube with longitudinally oscillating walls under an oscillatory pressure gradient. Apart from the
fundamental interest, the investigation of the dynamics of ﬂuid in porous media under oscillatory pressure gradient
and oscillating pore walls is of prime importance for the recently emerged technology of acoustic stimulation of oil
reservoirs [2]. For example, it is known that the natural pressure in an oil reservoir generally yields no more than
approximately 10 percent oil recovery. The residual oil is diﬃcult to produce due to its naturally low mobility, and the
enhanced oil recovery operations are used to increase production. It has been experimentally proven that there is a
substantial increase in the net ﬂuid ﬂow through porous space if the latter is treated with elastic waves. However, there
is a fundamental lack of understanding of the physical mechanisms of ﬂuid mobilization in saturated rock through the
eﬀect of elastic waves; the theory of such mobilization virtually does not exist. Biot’s theory can be used to describe
the interaction of ﬂuid-saturated

solid with the sound for a classic Newtonian ﬂuid; however, oil and other hydrocarbons exhibit signiﬁcant non-
Newtonian behavior [3]. The aim of this paper is therefore to incorporate non-Newtonian eﬀects into the classical
study of Biot [1].

Recently, del Rio, Lopez de Haro, Whitaker [4] presented a study of enhancement in the dynamic response of a
viscoelastic (Maxwell) ﬂuid ﬂowing in a stationary (non-oscillating) tube under the eﬀect of an oscillatory pressure
gradient. We combine this theory with the eﬀect of the acoustic oscillations of the walls of a tube introduced by Biot
[1], providing a complete description of the interaction of Maxwell ﬂuid, ﬁlling the pores, with acoustic waves.

Finally, in order to emphasize that the consept of dynamic permeability is an adequate way of desciprtion of the

phenomenon, we note that this concept has been widely used before [5].

In the next section we formulate our model, whereas the last section will conclude with the discussion of the results.

In this section we present our model of Maxwell ﬂuid ﬂowing in a cylindrical tube whose walls are oscillating
longitudinally and the ﬂuid is subject to an oscillatory pressure gradient. We give analitical solutions of the problem
in the frequency domain.

The governing equations of the problem consist of the continuity equation for the incompressible ﬂuid,

and the linearized momentum equation,

Here, ~v, p, ρ denote velocity, pressure and mass density of the ﬂuid, whereas ˜τ represents the viscous stress tensor.
We describe the viscoelatic eﬀects of the ﬂuid using Maxwell’s model, which assumes that

where η is the viscosity coeﬃcient and tm is the relaxation time.

Now, let u be a velocity of the wall of the tube which oscillates in time as e−iωt, where ω is the angular frequency.
The ﬂow of ﬂuid in a cylindrical tube with longitudinally oscillating walls can be descibed by a single component of
the velocity, namely, its z-component vz (z axis is along the ceterline of the tube). We use the cylindrical coordinate
system (r, φ, z) in the treatment of the problem. We introduce the relative velocty U1 as U1 = vz
u. Thus, assuming
that all physical quantities vary in time as

−

e−iωt, we arrive at the following master equation for U1

Here, we have introduced the following notations:

which is a sum of the applied pressure gradient and force exerted on the ﬂuid from the oscillating wall of the tube
and ν, which is ν = η/ρ. Note that a no-slip boundary condition at the wall is assumed.

The solution of Eq.(4) can be found to be [1]

where J0 is the Bessel function and β =

(ω2tm + iω)/ν.

Applying a no-slip boundary condition U1(a) = 0 at the wall of the tube, where a is its radius, we ﬁnally get

Here K(ω) is the dynamic permeability [4] that describes the frequency dependent response of the tube to the applied
total force on the ﬂuid. Simple comparison reveals that Eq.(6) resembles closely Eq.(6) from Ref. [4], with the only
diﬀerence being that we have X in place of their ∂p/∂z. Note that in the case of stationary tube walls (ρ(∂u/∂t)
0)
Eq.(6) exactly coincides with Eq.(6) from Ref.[4]. Simple calculation (applying L’Hospital rule for the 0/0 uncertanty)
shows that limω→0 K(ω) = a2/(8ν). Thus, following Ref.[4], we will introduce the dimensionless dynamic permeability
as K ∗(ω) = K(ω)/K(0), which will be used later (see Fig.7). Note, that we were able to easily reproduce Fig. 1 from
Ref. [4], conﬁrming the existence of sharp resonances of K ∗(ω) in the elastic regime (see below for the deﬁnition of
this regime).

Note, that F (κ) measures the deviation from Poiseuille ﬂow friction as a function of frequency parameter κ, as
introduced by Biot [1].

In Eq.(9), α denotes the Deborah number [4], which is deﬁned as the ratio of characteristic time of viscous eﬀects

p

p

tv = a2/ν to the relaxation time tm, i.e. α = tv/tm = a2/(νtm).

As noted in Ref. [4], the value of the parameter α determines in which regime the system resides. Beyond a certain
critical value (αc = 11.64), the system is dissipative, and viscous eﬀects dominate. On the other hand, for small α
(α < αc) the system exhibits viscoelastic behavoir which we call the elastic regime.

Note, that the Newtonian ﬂow regime can be easily recovered from Eq.(9) by putting α

. We plot this limiting
case in Fig. 1. As it can be seen from the ﬁgure, both Re[F (κ)] and Im[F (κ)] exactly coincide with the Newtonian
limiting case studied in Biot’s work (see Fig. 4 in Ref.[1]). This graph demonstrates a breakdown in Poiseuille ﬂow
√ω). In all our calculations we have used polynomial expansions of J0 and J1
as frequency increases (recall that κ
with absolute error not exceeding 10−6 %. Thus, our calculation results are accurate to this order.

A ﬁnite-but-large α regime is shown in the next two ﬁgures. Fig. 2 corresponds to the case when α = 104. We
see in Fig. 2 that the real and imaginary parts of F (κ) start to deviate from the Newtonian ﬂuid behavior at large
frequencies. In Fig. 3 solutions correspond to the case when α = 100.0; thus we see how viscoelastic eﬀects become
pronounced already at low frequencies.

∝

Fig. 4 presents the behavior of Re[F (κ)] and Im[F (κ)] when α = 10.0. As it can be seen from the graph, sharp
resonances appear on the curves. This feature can be explained by the fact that in this case α is less than αc, which
means that the system switched from the dissipative (viscous) regime to the elastic one.

Fig. 5 shows the solutions when α = 1.0. In this case we see more irregular behavior of Re[F (κ)] and Im[F (κ)]

with a number of irregular spikes.

The extreme non-Newtonian (elastic) regime is studied in Fig. 6 where we plot the solutions for the case when
α = 10−3. In this case notable change is that there are fewer but more pronounced spikes. Re[F (κ)] is close to zero
for most of the frequencies, and only at certain frequencies we see sharp resonances. In this regime the system acts a
window for these frequencies.

Another noteworthy observation is that, on one hand, as long as α > αc = 11.64 (Figs. 2 and 3), Re[F (κ)] is always
greater than its initial value, i.e. Re[F (κ)] > 1, and for large frequencies it reaches a ceratin asymptotic value. On
the other hand, when α < αc (Figs. 4-6), we observe an overall decrease in Re[F (κ)] with the increase in frequency,
i.e., Re[F (κ)] < 1 for all κ’s.

In Fig. 7 we have also studied the behavior of the dimensionless dynamic permeability K ∗(ω∗) as a function of
ω∗, the dimensionless frequency deﬁned as ω∗ = tmω, for the case when α = 0.1. Since α < αc, we observe sharp
resonances in the dynamic permability at certain frequences, which can be explained by the non-Newtonian behavior
of the ﬂuid.

III. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have studied non-Newtonian eﬀects on the dynamics of ﬂuids in porous media by calculating a
ﬂow of Maxwell ﬂuid in a tube, which oscillates longitudinally and is subject to an oscillatory pressure gradient.
The present study investigates novelties brought about into the classic Biot’s theory [1] of propagation of elastic
waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous solid by inclusion of non-Newtonian eﬀects. We have used time Fourier transform
and converted the problem to the frequency domain. We have calculated the dynamic permeability, thus modifying
the work of del Rio, Lopez de Haro, Whitaker [4] by inclusion of the eﬀect of longitunally oscillating tube walls.
We investigated how the function F (κ), which measures the deviation from Poiseuille ﬂow friction as a function of
frequency parameter κ, is modiﬁed by non-Newtonian eﬀects. Our work thus provides a combined theory of non-
Newtonian ﬂow in a longitudinally oscillating tube, which constitutes the basis for a realistic model of the eﬀects of
elastic waves in a ﬂuid-saturated porous space. The present analisys clearly demonstrates the existence of a transition
from a dissipative to elastic regime (as α decreases), in which sharp enhancements of ﬂow (resonances) occur.

The importance of the current work is two-fold:
(A) We studied modiﬁcations brought about by non-Newtonian eﬀects into Biot’s theory. The investigation of the
function F (κ) is important for a number of applications, since F (κ) uniquely determines the response of a realistic
ﬂuid-saturated porous medium to the elastic waves. Thus, determination of F (κ) for non-Newtonian (Maxwell) ﬂuid
is necessary to guide e.g., oil-ﬁeld exploration applications.

(B) As we have seen from Fig. 7, non-Newtonian eﬀects cause substantial enhancements in dynamic permeability.
We were not able to determine in the literature what value of α a natural crude oil would have. However, as it can be
seen from Fig.7 for α = 0.1, we can get up to 60 times increase in permeability at certain resonant frequences. Lower
α’s yield even more drastic emhancements. At any rate, we obtained an analytical expression for F (κ) (Eq.(9)), which
can provide the behavior of this function for any given α.

In the introduction section, the practical impact of the possibility of acoustic stimulation of oil reservoirs has been
outlined. This result clearly demonstrates that in the crude oil, that can be modelled as a Maxwell ﬂuid, there are
certain resonant frequencies at which oil production can be increased signiﬁcantly if the well is irradiated with elastic
waves at these frequencies.

Abstract

Discussions on a form of a frequency spectrum of wind-driven sea waves just above the

spectral maximum continue during the last three decades. In 1958 Phillips made a conjecture

that wave breaking is the main mechanism responsible for the spectrum formation. That leads

to the spectrum decay

between the numerous experimental data and this spectrum. The experiments show decay

ω−

4. There are two general ways of the explanation of this phenomenon. The ﬁrst one

∼
(proposed by Banner (1990)) takes into account the Doppler effect due to surface circular

∼

currents generated by long waves in the Phillips model. The second approach ascends to the

work by Zakharov and Filonenko (1968). It is based on four-wave interactions in the kinetic

equation and gives good agreement with the experimental data.

In this article the contribution to the Phillips model due to the Doppler effect was examined.

We considered the cases of isotropic and strongly anisotropic spectra. Both analytical results

and numerical computations give us an evidence to state that the Doppler effect cannot explain

the divergence of Phillips model with experimental data.

Introduction

transmitted energy.

The problem of propagation of waves on the surface of the ocean is one of the classical problems of hydro-

dynamics. The ﬁrst theoretical result goes back to the work of Airy (1845), who stated that the waves of

small amplitude are sinusoidal. Then Stokes (1847) took into account the ﬁrst nonlinear correction to the

After this a large number of interesting and important papers was published . But having in mind the goal

of this article, it is necessary to mention several works. Phillips (1960) has shown that the nonlinearities of

the third order transferring the energy from three waves to fourth one, can cause continuous energy transfer

over the wide frequency interval to the free wave. Hasselmann (1962,63) has calculated the amount of the

The work by Phillips (1958) contained a suggestion that the main phenomenon inﬂuencing the form of

spectrum is the wave breaking. This results in the spectrum decay

spectral pike. In this hypothesis the wave-wave interaction was neglected. The ﬁrst experiments seemed to

give a support to Phillips’ idea. But later experiment by Toba (1972) give the different result - the decay

∼

Toba’s data. This contradiction initiated the search of explanation of this fact.

There are two completely different models of explaining this phenomenon. After the works by Hasselman

(1962,63) on kinetic equation the importance of wave-wave interaction for surface waves on liquid has been

understood. In the paper of Zakharov and Filonenko (1968) taking into account weak nonlinear four-wave

interaction in the Hasselman kinetic equation the spectrum

ω−

4 was obtained. This result has clear

physical explanation. This is weak turbulent Kolmogorov spectrum corresponding to the direct cascade of

∼

energy to the high frequency region.

Despite of the existence of physically clear explanation several scientists continue to use the Phillips

model. An alternative explanation was proposed in the work of Banner (1990), it is based on taking into

account spectrum distortion due to Doppler effect of circular currents, brought about long wave background

currents.

There were several works about short wave propagation on the background of a long wave. One of

them was the work by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1960). The work by Craik (1987) was based on the

Zakharov’s (1968) spectral formulation and gives more general results. Both of them take into account

wave-wave interaction. As was mentioned above this is in contradiction with the Phillips approach. It

means that those works cannot help us in exploring the Banner’s hypothesis.

It is obvious that knowledge of the spectrum form above the spectral pike is necessary for accurate

computation of nonlinear energy transmission. Hence it is important to understand, what point of view on

the phenomenon is correct.

In this paper we examine the assumption of Banner (1990) (developed by Donelan (1998)). In Sect. 2 we

introduced the general notations (following Phillips). In Sect. 3 the general formula for spectrum (taking

into account Doppler shifting) is derived. It is convenient to introduce a new set of dimensionless variables,

2

this is considered in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we develop an important case of dispersion ω2 = gk (”deep water”)

where g is the gravity acceleration, k is the wave number equal to 2π/λ. Section 6 is devoted to numerical

results. The conclusion is placed in Sect. 7. The results obtained allow us to state, that the mechanism

suggested by Banner (1990) and Donelan (1998) does not give the result corresponding to experiments. It

looks like that the only non contradictory explanation of experimental data was proposed by Zakharov and

3 General formula for spectrum with the account for the Doppler effect

Let us assume that we study waves on the background of cyclic current v(t) beneath the surface. Taking

into account the Doppler effect in the dispersion equation one can get the following substitution

Suppose that this current is described by a one-dimensional periodic function

ω(k)

ω(k) + kv(t).

−→

v(t) = v cos ω0t.

This allows us to rewrite our substitution in the following form

ωk −→

ω(k) + kv cos(ω0t) cos ψ,

where ψ is the angle formed by k and v vectors. Without loose of generality one can take ψ = θ. Using

this expression one can rewrite Eq. (7) as

5 Deep water case

For further study of the isotropic spectrum (this case is more complex so let us do it ﬁrst and then perform

the same calculations for the anisotropic case) we have to introduce the form of the dispersion law. We

think that the case of the deep water surface is the most important. We have to use explicit expression of

this is just the Phillips spectrum Eq. (14) in absence of Doppler effect for strongly anisotropic distribution.

Let us try to evaluate the range of applicability of obtained results. As was postulated in Eq. (20) we can

Following Banner (1990) we can take ǫ = v/cp = 0.05. After this one can obtain the following inequality

In the works of Banner (1990) and Donelan (1998) the Doppler shifting has to give us the desired ω−
4 spectrum as an artifact of the

spectrum in the range ω/ωp > 3. It means that we cannot consider the ω−

observation of time histories at a point brought about by Doppler shifting of the short waves riding on the

orbital currents of the long waves.

The integrals Eq. (29), Eq. (30), Eq. (33) and Eq. (34) can be easily calculated numerically. It is not very

illustrative to view the explicit form of the spectrum, so let us represent it as the ratio F (λ)/F0(λ). The

expressions Eq. (29), Eq. (33) and Eq. (30), Eq. (34) give us the curves shown in Fig. 1.

It is obvious that the form of the ﬁrst part of the decomposition is not linear and it means that we cannot

range (λ

7 Conclusion

The presence of at least two different approaches on the wind-driven sea waves frequency spectra formation

motivate us to examine the Phillips model in the presence of the Doppler effect. The pure Phillips model

gives the results essentially different with the experimental data. Following Banner conjecture we obtained

the general formula for an arbitrary frequency spectrum in the presence of the Doppler effect. Using this

formula we have performed an analytical analysis of the inﬂuence of the Doppler frequency shifting on sur-

face waves’ spectra at the deep water and strongly anisotropic cases. The forms of spectra were calculated

numerically for a wide range of frequencies.

Analytical and numerical results give an irrefutable proof of inconsistency of Doppler shifting mechanism

in ﬁtting Phillips model with the experimental results. An analytical estimation shows that in the presence

of Doppler effect its contribution is negligible. The numerical computation gives spectrum decay

least up to frequency

According to present experimental results one has to recognize that Phillips model of energy dissipation

does not give the result similar to experimental data even if the Doppler effect takes place.

Figure Captions

Fig. 1. Ratio of calculated spectra F to Phillips spectrum as a function of dimensionless variable λ is shown. It is
clearly that F starting to deviate from Phillips spectrum only at λ ∼ 0.4

Fig. 2. Logarithm of calculated spectra F and Phillips spectrum as a function of logarithm of dimensionless variable
λ is represented. It is easy to see that calculated spectra are lines are exactly parallel to line corresponding to Phillips

spectra. This allow us to conclude that the power of frequency is the same and is equal to -5

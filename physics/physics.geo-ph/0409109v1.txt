Abstract

We present ab initio calculations of the high-temperature axial c/a ratio of hexagonal-
close-packed (hcp) iron at Earth’s core pressures, in order to help interpret the ob-
served seismic anisotropy of the inner core. The calculations are based on density
functional theory, which is known to predict the properties of high-pressure iron with
good accuracy. The temperature dependence of c/a is determined by minimising the
Helmholtz free energy at ﬁxed volume and temperature, with thermal contributions
due to lattice vibrations calculated using harmonic theory. Anharmonic corrections
to the harmonic predictions are estimated from calculations of the thermal average
stress obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of hcp iron at the
conditions of the inner core. We ﬁnd a very gradual increase of axial ratio with
temperature. This increase is much smaller than found in earlier calculations, but
is in reasonable agreement with recent high-pressure, high-temperature diﬀraction
measurements. This result casts doubt on an earlier interpretation of the seismic
anisotropy of the inner core.

ties of the Earth’s solid inner core (Stixrude et al. (1994); Stixrude and Cohen
(1995); S¨oderlind et al. (1996); Wasserman et al. (1996); Stixrude et al. (1997);
Voˇcadlo et al. (1997); Steinle-Neumann et al. (1999); Vocadlo et al. (2000);
Belonoshko et al. (2003); Laio et al. (2000); Alf`e et al. (2001); Steinle-Neumann et al.
(2001, 2002); Voˇcadlo et al. (2003)), including its elastic properties. A contro-
versial issue, addressed by some of this work, concerns the elastic anisotropy
of the inner core (Creager (1992); Tromp (1993)), i.e. the fact that compres-
sional waves are observed to traverse the core region some 3–4% faster along
the Earth’s rotational axis than in the equatorial plane. It is widely assumed
that the phase of Fe in the inner core is hexagonal close packed (hcp), and it
has become clear that to understand the elastic properties it is necessary to
know how the axial ratio c/a depends on temperature and pressure. In order
to provide information about this, we present here ab initio calculations of the
axial ratio of hcp iron over a range of pressures and temperatures relevant to
the inner core.

Ab initio calculations on pure crystalline iron are very relevant for under-
standing the inner core, even though the core is known to contain light im-
purities (the leading candidates are O, Si and S), and is believed to contain
Ni as well as Fe (Poirier (1994)). Recent estimates (Alf`e et al. (2002a)) sug-
gest that the fraction of light impurities in the inner core is approximately
8.5 mol%, and this low fraction will probably not change its properties greatly.
The Ni content will also probably make only a small diﬀerence, since the
electronic structures of Ni and Fe are so similar. The determination of the
properties of pure Fe is thus essential as a starting point for further reﬁne-
ments. The common assumption that Fe in the inner core is in the hcp struc-
ture has recently been challenged (Voˇcadlo et al. (2003); Belonoshko et al.
(2003)), and it is possible that the crystal structure is diﬀerent in diﬀerent
parts of the core (Song and Helmberger (1998); Ishii and Dziewonski (2002);
Beghein and Trampert (2003)). However, in order to make progress, it is clearly
essential to understand the properties of the leading candidates, of which hcp
is certainly one. It is well established that density functional theory (DFT)
(Hohenberg and Kohn (1964); Kohn and Sham (1965); Jones and Gunnarsson
(1989)) gives a rather accurate description of Fe and other transition metals,
both under ambient conditions, and under high pressures and temperatures.
This is known from comparisons with experiment for a wide range of prop-
erties, including the equilibrium lattice parameter under ambient conditions,
elastic constants, magnetic properties, phonon frequencies (Stixrude et al. (1994);
S¨oderlind et al. (1996); Voˇcadlo et al. (1997); Vocadlo et al. (2000)); the pressure-
volume relationship at high pressures, the phonon density of states and the
Hugoniot (Wasserman et al. (1996); Mao et al. (2001); Alf`e et al. (2001)).

A number of groups have used DFT calculations to investigate the elastic con-
stants of hcp Fe under inner-core conditions. The early calculations were per-
formed at zero temperature (Stixrude and Cohen (1995); Steinle-Neumann et al.

2

(1999)), and led to the suggestion that elastic anisotropy could be explained by
a preferential alignment of crystalline c-axes with the Earth’s rotational axis.
However, more recent work has indicated a strong temperature dependence of
the elastic constants (Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001, 2002)), including a cross-
ing of the c11 and c33 constants at approximately 1500 K, which would result
in a reversal of the necessary crystalline alignment. It appears that the strong
temperature dependence of the elastic constants is due in part to a rapid
increase of the axial ratio with increasing temperature. However, this work
can be questioned, because it is based upon a statistical mechanical approx-
imation known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) model (Hirshfelder et al. (1954);
Holt and Ross (1970); Holt et al. (1970); Ree and Holt (1973); Westra and Cowley
(1975); Cowley et al. (1990)), which may not be reliable. In addition, indepen-
dent PIC calculations have failed to reproduce their results (Gannarelli et al.
(2003)). Very recently, experimental work (Ma et al. (2004)) has shown that
this strong c/a variation with temperature is not observed at pressures up to
160 GPa. Our aim in this paper is to perform calculations of the high temper-
ature axial ratio, which are, as far as possible, free of statistical mechanical
approximations.

The calculation of phonon dispersion relations using DFT is nowadays com-
pletely routine, and this makes it possible to obtain the Helmholtz free energy
F of a high-temperature crystal without any statistical mechanical approxi-
mations, provided that anharmonicity can be ignored. Phonon dispersion re-
lations for Fe in both the magnetic body-centred cubic and the hcp structures
have been reported by several groups (Vocadlo et al. (2000)). The equilibrium
value of c/a can then be obtained for given V and T by minimising F with
respect to c/a. Of course, at temperatures near the melting point, it is not
obvious that anharmonic corrections to F can be neglected. However, direct
DFT molecular dynamics simulations allow the calculation of the thermal av-
erage stress tensor (Oganov et al. (2001)), so that the equilibrium c/a can be
found by requiring that the stress tensor be isotropic; such direct simulations
completely include anharmonicity. The DFT calculation of phonon frequencies
is straightforward and relatively inexpensive, but ab initio molecular dynam-
ics demands much larger computational resources. Our strategy in this work
is therefore to base most of the calculations on the harmonic approximation,
but to use a small number of molecular dynamics simulations to estimate
anharmonic corrections to the equilibrium c/a.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows: In Sec. 2 we present the technical
background to our electronic structure calculations, and describe the statistical
mechanical principles of our harmonic and molecular-dynamics calculations.
In Sec. 3 we describe our harmonic calculations, including the technical tests
we performed to ensure their accuracy. In Sec. 4 we present our ab initio
molecular-dynamics results. Discussion of our results for the temperature and
pressure dependence of the axial ratio follows in Sec. 5.

2 Techniques

The principal quantity in this work is the ab initio Helmholtz free energy
F (V, q, T ) as a function of the volume V , axial ratio q = c/a and temperature
T . Since the temperatures of interest here are far above the Debye tempera-
ture, F is given by the standard expression of classical statistical mechanics

F (V, q, T ) = −kBT ln

dr1 . . . drN exp[−UAI(r1 . . . rN ; Tel)/kBT ]

where T is the temperature and Λ is the thermal wavelength. The quantity
UAI(r1 . . . rN ; Tel) is the ab initio Helmholtz free energy of the system when the
atoms are ﬁxed at the positions {ri}; UAI is a free energy because it includes
thermal excitation of the electrons, at electronic temperature Tel, as described
by ﬁnite temperature density functional theory (Mermin (1965)). Since we
are interested in the case of full thermal equilibrium, we have Tel = T . In
the present work, the DFT calculation of UAI is made using the exchange-
correlation energy given by the PW91 generalised gradient approximation
(Wang and Perdew (1991)). The implementation of DFT is the projector aug-
mented wave (PAW) scheme (Bl¨ochl (1994); Kresse and Joubert (1999)) with
core radii, augmentation charge radii, etc. as reported in (Alf`e et al. (2000)).
As in our previous work, atomic states up to and including 3p are treated as
core states, but the high-pressure response of 3s and 3p states is included via
an empirical pair potential. This approximation is tested using spot-checks
with 3p electrons included in the valance set. All calculations were performed
using the VASP code (Kresse and Furthm¨uller (1996b,a)).

In practice, the ab initio Helmholtz free energy is separated into perfect lattice,
harmonic and anharmonic contributions:

F = Fperf + Fharm + Fanharm .

Here Fperf = UAI(R1 . . . RN ; Tel) is the ab initio free energy with all atoms
ﬁxed on their perfect-lattice positions {Ri}. The harmonic contribution Fharm
is given by (Alf`e et al. (2001))

with ¯ω the geometric mean phonon frequency:

where Nks is the total number of k-points and phonon-branches, the sum being

phonon frequencies ωks at each wavevector k are obtained by diagonalising the
dynamical matrix, whose elements are deﬁned in terms of the force-constant
matrix Φlsα,l′tβ as:

where M is the mass of each atom. Here R0
ls is the equilibrium position of
the sth atom in the lth primitive cell. Calculation of the force-constant ma-
trix Φ is performed by the small-displacement method (Kresse et al. (1995);
Alf`e et al. (2001); Alf´e (1998)), in which each atom in the primitive cell is
given a small displacement, and DFT is used to calculate the resulting force
on every atom in a large repeating cell. The calculation of the dynamical
matrix and hence the mean frequency ¯ω must be taken to convergence with
respect to the size of the repeating cell. For the hcp structure, the entire
Φ matrix is calculated by performing only two independent displacements,
as explained in Alf`e et al. (2001). Within the harmonic approximation, the
equilibrium c/a at given atomic volume and temperature is determined by
calculating Fperf(q) and Fharm(q) at a series of q values, and by minimising the
quantity Fperf(q) + Fharm(q) numerically.

Our estimates of anharmonic corrections to the equilibrium c/a are based on ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations. These are performed in the canonical
ensemble, using an Andersen thermostat (Andersen (1980)). The determina-
tion of the equilibrium c/a is based on a calculation of the time-averaged stress
tensor σαβ. The system is in hydrostatic equilibrium with respect to variation
of q when σ33 − σ11 = 0. In comparing with harmonic predictions, it is useful
to note that the components of the thermal average stress tensor are related
to the ab initio harmonic free energy by

where εαβ is the inﬁnitesimal strain tensor and V0 is the volume of the sys-
tem before application of the strain. In particular, for our constant volume
calculations of F (V, q, T ), we can write

< σαβ >=

∂εαβ !T

,

< σ33 − σ11 >=

.

(6)

(7)

This means that the stress component < σ33 − σ11 > within the harmonic
approximation can be obtained by taking the derivative with respect to q of
the free energy Fperf(q) + Fharm(q).

3 Harmonic calculation of the equilibrium axial ratio

In order to determine the equilibrium axial ratio in harmonic theory, the two
quantities that it is necessary to calculate are the perfect lattice free energy
Fperf, and the geometric mean phonon frequency ¯ω, both as function of volume,
axial ratio c/a and electronic temperature. The calculation of these quantities
is presented in the following subsections, and the results for the equilibrium
axial ratio are presented in Sec. 3.3. The precision we need to achieve in
the calculations is set by the precision with which we wish to determine the
equilibrium axial ratio. As a guideline, we set ourselves the target of obtaining
c/a to a precision of ±0.005.

3.1 Perfect lattice free energy

DFT results for the perfect lattice free energy for c/a = 1.6 were reported ear-
lier by Alf`e et al. (2001), and were more recently reported by Gannarelli et al.
(2003) for q in the range 1.48–1.72. The present calculations are closely re-
lated to the previous ones, but we have introduced some reﬁnements. We have
calculated Fperf for electronic temperatures in the range 1000–7000 K. For Tel
in this range, we ﬁnd that an 8 × 8 × 5 Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling set
provides a precision of better than 1.5 meV atom−1. The plane-wave cutoﬀ has
been set to achieve complete continuity in the curve Fperf(q), and to ensure
that at every point on this curve, the calculated energy and stress components
are converged to within our required targets.

For the set of Tel mentioned above, we have calculated Fperf for c/a in the
range 1.54–1.70, at steps of 0.01 and for volumes between 6.8 and 8.8 ˚A3 at
steps of 0.2 ˚A3, as well as at three particular volumes of interest, 6.97, 7.50 and
8.67 ˚A3. A parameterisation essentially exactly ﬁtting the data consists of a
cubic polynomial in c/a, whose coeﬃcients are ﬁtted to quartic polynomials in
Tel. As a point of reference for our later discussion, we have used these results
to calculate the equilibrium axial ratio at T = 0 as a function of volume. We
have converted the results to obtain q as a function of pressure by using the
P (V ) relation from Stixrude et al. (1994). In Fig. 1, we compare the resulting
values of q(P ) with very recent synchrotron measurements (Ma et al. (2004))
in the pressure range 60–160 GPa. In both cases, we see a very slight increase
of q with pressure, though the theoretical values are lower by about 0.008.

squares with error bars).

3.2 Harmonic calculations

As explained in Sec. 2, the harmonic vibrational free energy is determined
entirely by ¯ω. Values of ¯ω must be converged with respect to k-point sampling,
cell size and atomic displacement, and we must ensure that this convergence
is achieved across the required range of c/a. In order to achieve the required
tolerance in the harmonic free energy, systematic errors in ¯ω must not vary
with respect to q by more than 0.1%.

We have designed a strategy for ensuring convergence of ¯ω. In our initial
tests, we adopt a displacement of 0.01 ˚A, which has been used in previous
calculations (Alf`e et al. (2001)). With this displacement, we determine the
k-point sampling needed to obtain convergence for a 16-atom supercell. We
then study convergence with respect to cell size, the k-point sampling for
each cell size being chosen in the light of the k-point sampling tests of the
16-atom system. This set of tests tells us the cell size needed. To conclude
the tests, we then address convergence of atomic displacement and k-point
sampling for this cell size. All these tests are performed at Tel = 1000 K. This
temperature is deliberately chosen to be much lower than the temperatures of
real interest. We do this because the ﬁneness of k-point sampling needed to
achieve a given degree of convergence decreases with increasing temperature.
One can therefore be sure that if convergence is achieved with respect to k-
point sampling at 1000 K, it will certainly be achieved at higher temperatures.

7

For the 16-atom system, ¯ω was calculated for Monkhorst Pack sets up to
9 × 9 × 6. We ﬁnd that for a Monkhorst Pack 5 × 5 × 3 grid, ¯ω is converged to
within 0.01%. Next, a set of supercells was chosen, such that the dimension
along the the hexagonal axis is similar to the dimension in the basal plane.
Sizes chosen were 16 (2 ×2 ×2), 36 (3 ×3 ×2), 54 (3 ×3 ×3), 96 (4 ×4 ×3), 128
(4 × 4 × 4) and 150 (5 × 5 × 4) atoms. For each cell size, we calculate ¯ω using
k-point sampling that is equivalently ﬁner than the converged value of 5×5×3
in the 16-atom system. We ﬁnd that for a 54-atom system, ¯ω is converged to
within 0.5%, however the consistency between calculations for diﬀerent values
of c/a at this cell size, is much better than our tolerance. Finally, k-point and
displacement convergence were carried out on the 54-atom system. We found
that for a 3 × 3 × 2 Monkhorst Pack grid and a displacement of 0.01 ˚A, ¯ω is
converged to within approximately 1% in absolute terms, but, again, to well
within our tolerances for non-cancelling errors. These tests were all performed
for both c/a = 1.60 and 1.70. All the harmonic results that follow were based
upon values of ¯ω calculated for these values of supercell size, k-point sampling
and displacement.

Calculations of ¯ω were performed for atomic volumes of 6.97, 7.50 and 8.97 ˚A3,
for c/a from 1.58 to 1.70 in steps of approximately 0.03, and for electronic
temperatures of 2000, 4000 and 6000 K. We parameterised ln ¯ω(q) for each
volume and temperature using a second order polynomial in q, which gave an
eﬀectively exact ﬁt to the results.

3.3 Harmonic results for equilibrium axial ratio

Equilibrium values of c/a were obtained at 6.97, 7.50 and 8.67 ˚A3 and tem-
peratures of 0, 2000, 4000 and 6000 K, by analytic minimisation of the total
harmonic free energy Fperf(q) + Fharm(q), using the polynomial parameterisa-
tions described above for ln ¯ω(V, q, Tel) and Fperf (V, q, Tel). Results are shown in
Fig. 2, together with the previous theoretical results of Steinle-Neumann et al.
(2001) and the very recent experimental results of Ma et al. (2004). Note that
all the theoretical results show the variation of c/a with T at ﬁxed volume,
whereas the experimental results are at the ﬁxed pressure of 161 GPa. The
present results diﬀer greatly from the earlier theoretical results, in that we
ﬁnd only a very moderate increase of c/a with temperature. The experimental
increase of c/a with temperature is also far smaller than the predictions of
Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001), and is, if anything, smaller than the variation
that we predict. More detailed discussion will be given in Sec. 5.

(2004) at 7.73 ˚A3/atom (open squares with error bars) and our own ab initio MD
calculations at 6.97 ˚A3.

4 Molecular dynamics calculations

The determination of the equilibrium axial ratio by ab initio molecular dynam-
ics is based on the calculation of stresses; speciﬁcally on the stress diﬀerence
σ33 − σ11, which disappears for the equilibrium value of c/a. In order to apply
this technique successfully, a number of technical sources of error must be
brought under control. Firstly, the duration of the run must be long enough
to reduce statistical errors to within an acceptable level; secondly, the size
of the simulation cell must be large enough; and thirdly, electronic k-point
sampling must be adequate. The ﬁrst two of the convergence questions can
be addressed in detail using classical molecular dynamics simulations, and
we have performed tests of this kind as described below. The question of k-
point convergence will be discussed when we present our ab initio molecular
dynamics calculations in Sec. 4.2.

Although ab initio molecular dynamics calculations fully include anharmonic-
ity, they are very demanding in terms of computational resources, so that we
can only perform these calculations at a very small number of state points.
Our aim is to put limits on the possible size of anharmonic corrections to the
stress, and hence to c/a. Our ab initio molecular dynamics results for σ33 −σ11

9

can be compared with our harmonic calculations by using Eqn. (7) to calculate
σ33 − σ11 in the harmonic approximation. Since anharmonicity is negligible at
low temperatures, the harmonic and molecular dynamics calculations of the
stress should be in close agreement under these conditions. This provides a
further check both on our harmonic and molecular dynamics results.

4.1 Molecular dynamics simulations for an embedded-atom model

Our tests on statistical and system-size errors were performed using an em-
bedded atom model (EAM) for Fe, similar to that used by Belonoshko et al.
(2000). In the EAM, the total energy Etot of a system of N atoms is rep-
resented as the sum of two contributions. First, an empirical, repulsive pair
potential, and secondly, a sum of embedding energies for each atom, repre-
senting quantum mechanical band-structure eﬀects:

0.9r1. The parameters have been modiﬁed somewhat from those given by
Belonoshko et al. (2000), in order to reproduce better our ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations on solid and liquid Fe (Alf`e et al. (2001, 2002b)). The
parameters we user are: n = 5.93, m = 4.788, ǫ = 0.1662 eV, a = 3.4714 ˚A

Fig. 3. 15 ps time-averaged calculations of σ0 = σ33 − σ11 for a variety of cell sizes
within the embedded atom model.

In order to assess the length of run needed to reduce the statistical error on
σ33 −σ11 to an acceptable level, we have performed molecular dynamics runs at
several system sizes and at a number of diﬀerent thermodynamic state points.
An illustration of such a run is given in Fig. 4. On the basis of these calculations
we ﬁnd that, in order to reduce the r.m.s. statistical errors to within 1 GPa, for
example, we require a run of length 3–4 ps. Since the r.m.s. error is inversely
proportional to the square root of the length of run, we may immediately infer
the length of run necessary to obtain any required precision. From statistical
mechanics, we expect that for a given length of run, the r.m.s. error on the
stress components will decrease with increasing system size as N − 1
2 , where N
is the number of atoms. We ﬁnd that this is consistent with tests performed
on system size, with r.m.s. errors on a 1.5 ps average falling from 2 GPa for a
54-atom cell, to 1 GPa for 150 atoms. To test size errors we performed runs on
systems containing 54, 96, 128 and 150 atoms at identical state points. Fig. 3
shows the eﬀect of system size on σ33 − σ11. Error bars show r.m.s. statistical
errors as described above. We see that for a system of 96 atoms, the error due
to size eﬀects is within approximately 0.6 GPa.

It follows from these tests that in order to calculate σ33 − σ11 to a tolerance
needed to determine the equilibrium axial ratio to within 0.005, it should be
enough to perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of 1 ps on 96
atoms.

As a further test of our techniques, we have compared molecular dynamics
results for σ33 − σ11 with the predictions of harmonic theory for the embedded

atom model. Fig. 5 presents the molecular dynamics and harmonic results for
V = 6.97 ˚A3, c/a = 1.65 for a range of temperatures. Because of the gradual
variation of σ33 − σ11 with temperature, we use longer runs of up to 5 ps. Cell
sizes are converged withing the limits discussed above. We see that at low
temperatures, the molecular dynamics results reproduce well the predictions
of harmonic theory. This agreement provides additional conﬁrmation that the
statistical and system-size errors on the molecular dynamics calculations are
very small. The deviation, rising to around 8.5 GPa at 6000 K, shows the
high-temperature emergence of anharmonic eﬀects.

4.2 Ab initio molecular dynamics results

We have performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at an atomic
volume of 6.97 ˚A3, in which we have calculated σ33 − σ11. The molecular
dynamics calculations are performed using exactly the same DFT methods as
in the harmonic calculations. From the tests on the embedded atom model,
we already have a good indication of the cell size and length of run necessary,
but the question of k-points must also be addressed. To do this, we calculate
σ33 − σ11 for several disordered conﬁgurations, selected from classical M.D.
trajectories, both with Γ-point sampling and with larger numbers of k-points.
Our tests are performed for a 96-atom system, with an atomic volume of
6.97 ˚A3 and an axial ratio of 1.65. The molecular dynamics simulation from

which the conﬁgurations were drawn was performed at 5000 K. We took 4
snapshots at intervals of 0.2 ps. For this state point, σ33 − σ11, with Γ-point
sampling is equal to 7.0 ± 2 GPa. For a 2 × 2 × 2 k-point grid, it is equal to
7.1 ± 2.6 GPa. Similar tests were performed to ensure that size eﬀects were
consistent with the embedded atom model.

Our ab initio calculations at 6.97 ˚A3 were performed for c/a = 1.615 and
1.66, and for T = 4000 K and 5000 K. Fig. 6 shows results for σ33 − σ11
along with harmonic predictions. We see that our molecular dynamics results
closely resemble the predictions of harmonic theory, and vary in the same way
with c/a. However, even allowing for the error bars, there is an appreciable
diﬀerence between the harmonic and M.D. results. One of the technical sources
of error which could account for this discrepancy is system size eﬀects. In order
to check this, we have repeated the 5000 K runs using 150 atoms instead of 96.
The results of this test suggest that system-size errors could account for most
of this discrepancy. We have also examined other technical sources of error,
such as plane-wave cutoﬀ and k-point sampling; however, as described above,
there are not capable of producing such a discrepancy. It is possible in principle
that some of this discrepancy can be attributed to anharmonic eﬀects, but it
is diﬃcult to separate this from other eﬀects with any certainty. Even allowing
for the remaining uncertainties, it seems certain that anharmonic eﬀects are
not capable of shifting the equilibrium axial ratio by more than about 0.01.

Fig. 6. Comparison of ab initio M.D. (heavy curves) and harmonic (light) results for
the stress σ33 −σ11. Solid lines are at 4000 K, dashed lines at 5000 K. The dotted line
shows results for 150-atom molecular dynamics at 4000 K. The diamond represents
a 96-atom run including 3p states explicitly in the valence set. All calculations
were performed for an atomic volume of 6.97 ˚A3. For comparison with earlier PIC
calculations due to Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001), see Fig. 2.

We have also used ab initio M.D. to test another signiﬁcant question. All our
harmonic and M.D. calculations up to this point have treated 3p and 3s elec-
trons as core states, but with the high-pressure response of these states treated
via an empirical pair potential. In order to test the eﬀect of this approximation,
we have repeated the 96-atom M.D. calculations at 5000 K with 3p electrons
explicitly included in the valence set. The resulting stress σ33 −σ11 agrees with
our other results within our error bars. This indicates that the eﬀects of this
approximation are negligible for our present purposes.

5 Conclusions

We have shown that it is rather straightforward to calculate harmonic free
energies, and hence calculate the variation of c/a within the harmonic ap-
proximation. Because these calculations are computationally inexpensive, it is
possible to apply them to a wide variety of thermodynamic state points. Since
our earlier comparisons with experiment (Mao et al. (2001)) show the reliabil-
ity of our density functional methods for calculating the phonon frequencies
for iron at high pressures, we expect our predictions of the temperature depen-
dence of c/a to be reliable. We have also shown that direct ab initio molecular
dynamics simulation can be used to put limits on the possible size of anhar-

14

monic eﬀects. These methods are rather expensive, but provide a means to
perform “spot checks” on our results. The molecular dynamics calculations
show that anharmonic corrections to the c/a ratio are small, even at temper-
atures near the melting point.

The main scientiﬁc conclusion from the work is that c/a varies only rather
weakly with temperature, and that its variation becomes weaker as pressures
approach those of the inner core. Quantitatively, at a pressure of 100 GPa, c/a
increases from 1.585 at zero temperature, to 1.61 at the melting point, and at
300 GPa, from 1.59 at zero temperature, to 1.62 at the melting point. These
results do not support the earlier predictions by Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001)
of a strong increase of c/a with temperature within the particle-in-cell approx-
imation. Interestingly, the results we have found are very similar to our own
predictions from the particle-in-cell approximation (Gannarelli et al. (2003)).
This implies that this approximation cannot be responsible for the large dis-
crepancy between the present results and those of Steinle-Neumann et al.
(2001). This ﬁnding of a rather weak increase of c/a with temperature is
strongly supported by the recent diﬀraction experiments of Ma et al. (2004).
Even allowing for the signiﬁcant error bars on their c/a results, it seems clear
that at 161 GPa, 2000 K, c/a is no bigger than about 1.61 at most. Our results
would indicate a value of around 1.60 under these conditions.

Our results have implications for understanding the elastic anisotropy of the
inner core. Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001) predicted a reversal of the crystalline
alignment required to explain the anisotropy of the inner core, due to a crossing
of the c11 and c33 elastic moduli at approximately 1500 K. They attribute this
to the strong temperature-dependence they ﬁnd in c/a. Since our results cast
doubt on this strong temperature dependence, they also cast doubt on the
proposed explanation for the elastic anisotropy. However, in order to resolve
this question fully, we need to make ab initio predictions of the elastic moduli,
that are free of statistical mechanical approximations. The methods we have
presented here should be capable of achieving this, and we hope to be able to
present such results in due course.

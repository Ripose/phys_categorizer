Recently it has been found by F. Freund that the granite under high pressure undergoes a phase
transition from insulator to a p-type semiconductor. This phase transition is a key concept to
understanding pre-earthquake phenomena. This eﬀect accompanies with the radiation of the granite
in the mid-infrared region. we were able to predict the recent earthquake in the south of Iran by
monitoring this radiation.

Ordinary rocks are insulators. Rocks placed under
great stress, however, sometimes act like semiconductors.
It has been found by Freund that, before a quake, pairs
of positive charges called ’defect electrons’ or ’positive
holes’ split up and migrate to the surface of stressed
rocks. There they recombine with each other and, in
the process, release infrared radiation.
Indeed insula-
tor turns into semiconductor when p-holes are activated.
This phase transition is responsible for the observation
of earthquake clouds, positive potential on the granites,
magnetic ﬁeld anomaly, decreasing the surface electrical
resistivity and mid-Infrared radiation etc [1]. On 14th
Feb. 2004 at 3:00 GMT, we have observed a creation of
ionized cloud in the place with location 30-31 N, 54-55
E in the south-east of the city Yazd. At 18 Feb. 2004
at 5:00 GMT, we observed the second ionized currents at
the same location. At this location over the local gran-
ites appearing out of the ground, we measured the sur-
face resistivity of the granites using the four point probe
method. The existence of positive potential on the gran-
ite surface was detected. Using the MODIS on board
NASA’s Terra satellite data we checked the mid-IR ra-
diation of the location in channel 20, with wavelength
range of 3.660-3.840 µm. We checked that from Nov.
2003 until 10th Feb. 2004, there was no diﬀerence in
the gray level distribution of the mid-IR radiation. At
15th Feb. 2004 the statistical properties of the radiation
has changed, for instance the standard deviation of in-
tensity distribution changes from 24.41 at 10th Feb. to
11.47 at 15th Feb. The situation remained stable until to
24th Feb. 2004. At 24th Feb. the standard deviation was
16.58 and the radiation location goes to turn oﬀ. At 25th
Feb. 2004 the whole statistical properties has returned
to the situation similar to Nov. 2003. At 26th Feb. 2004
at 20:10 GMT the ﬁrst shocks of the earthquake hit the
the region. On 27th Feb. 2004 at 04:40 GMT and 04:45
GMT, the region has been hit by two other earthquakes
with 3.1M. At 28th Feb. 2004 at 00:34 GMT, the region
was hit by another earthquake with magnitude 2.9M and
then on 28th Feb. 2004 at 01:11 GMT by 3.7 M.

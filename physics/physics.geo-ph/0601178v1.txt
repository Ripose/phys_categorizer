After the submission of the paper, three strong earthquakes with magnitude around 6.0-units
occurred on October 17 and October 20, 2005, with epicenters in the Aegean Sea, at a distance only
100km from MYT station at which the intense signals M1 to M4 -analyzed in the main text- have
been recorded. This conﬁrms experimentally the proposed criterion we used for the classiﬁcation of
these signals as Seismic Electric Signals (SES). Moreover, we show that, if we follow the procedure
described in [P.A. Varotsos, N. V. Sarlis, H. K. Tanaka and E. S. Skordas Phys. Rev. E 72,
041103 (2005)], the analysis in the natural time of the seismicity after the SES initiation allows the
estimation of the time window of the impending earthquakes with very good accuracy.

PACS numbers: 05.40.-a, 91.30.Dk, 87.19.Nn, 05.45.Tp

On October 17, 2005 two strong earthquakes (EQs) with magnitude around 6.0-units occurred at 05:45:20 and
12:46:57 UT with epicenters (according to USGS) at 38.15oN ,26.68oN and 38.13oN ,26.65oN , respectively (see Fig.1).
At the same epicenter, a third almost equally strong earthquake occurred at 21:40 UT on October 20,2005. All the
three epicenters lie at a distance of around 100km from Lesvos island, at which the MYT station -on the dipoles of
which the intense signals M1 to M4 (Fig.1(a),(b) of the main text) have been recorded- is located. This verifes that
these signals are actually Seismic Electric Signals (SES) as classiﬁed in advance (i.e., upon the initial submission of
the paper on April 16,2005) in the main text on the basis of the entropy criterion proposed.

We now follow the procedure described in Refs.[1, 2], in order to investigate whether the time window of the impend-
37.5 E28.0
ing strong EQs could have been estimated. We consider either the region A:N 39.5
26.0 ,
which surround the EQ epicenters and the MYT station (see Fig.1), and study how the seismicity evolved after the
SES initiation. If we set the natural time for seismicity zero at the initiation of the concerned SES activities, we form
time series of seismic events in natural time for various time windows as the number N of consecutive (small) EQs
increases. We now compute the normalized power spectrum [1, 2] in natural time Π(φ) for each of the time windows
and the results are depicted in Fig.2. As examples we consider in this ﬁgure two magnitude thresholds (herafter
referring to the local magnitude ML or the ‘duration’ magnitude MD) 3.4 (upper) and 3.6 (lower). In the same ﬁgure,
we plot in blue the power spectrum obeying the relation

which holds[1, 3, 4] when the system enters into the critical stage (ω = 2πφ, where φ stands for the natural frequency[1,
3, 5]). An inspection of Fig.2 reveals that the red line approaches the blue line as N increases and a coincidence occurs
at the last small event which had a magnitude 3.6 and occurred at 04:31 UT on October 17, 2005, i.e., roughly one
hour before the ﬁrst strong EQ. To ensure that this coincidence is a true one[1, 2, 5] we also calculate the evolution of
κ1,S and S− (cf. κ1 stands for the variance κ1 ≡ hχ2i − hχi2 as explained in Refs.[1, 3]) and the results are depicted
in Fig.3 for three magnitude thresholds 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

We now further comment on the aforementioned results. Since the strong EQs occurred in the border between Greece
and Turkey, the seismicity catalogues of neither Greek nor the Turkish Institutes can be considered as complete for
small magnitudes. Hence, we preferred here to make the calculations by using the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) catalogue (see Table I). Irrespective if we use the seismicity in the region N 39.5
25.5 or in the smaller region
N 39.5
26.0 , the coincidence occurs upon the occurence of the aforementioned 3.6 EQ (almost 1 hour before the ﬁrst
strong EQ). The magnitude of this EQ comes from the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) (see
the corresponding announcement in Fig.4) since it has not yet been reported by USGS. Note that if we take the
magnitude of this EQ to be somewhat larger, then the ﬁrst box in Fig.3 (which has been plotted for magnitude

FIG. 2: The normalized power spectrum(red) Π(φ) of the seismicity in area A as it evolves event by event after the initiation
of the SES activities M1 to M4. The two examples presented correspond to the two diﬀerent magnitude thresholds 3.4 and 3.6

the Π(φ) of Eq.(1) is depicted by blue color.

threshold 3.4) shows that the coincidence occurs on the last but one event, i.e., on October 13,2005 (almost three
days before the ﬁrst strong EQ).

The following comment might be useful: In the analysis of signals depicted in Figs1(a),(b) we proceeded as follows:
We ﬁrst analyzed M1 (recorded on March 21, see Fig1(a)) and found that it obeys the criterion (i.e., S and S− smaller
than Su). We then turned to the recordings on March 23: we ﬁrst considered M4 -which is well distinguishable from
the others in view of its opposite polarity- and found again that the criterion is fullﬁlled. As for the remaining
recordings of March 23(comprising M2 and M3) we checked both possibilities that is: (1) we considered M2 and
M3 together and found that not only the criterion was violated but also the M2 + M3 signal (altogether) behaved
like signals obtained from a ”uniform” distribution(i.e., κ1 was around 1/12). (2)on the other hand, if we analyse
separately M2 and M3 then both results obeyed the criterion. (thus being consistent with the conclusions drawn from
M1 and M4). Hence, we preferred to draw in Fig.1b the latter possibility. It has been earlier suggested (see pages
18 and 114 of Ref.[10] of the main text) that the change of the SES polarity might be associated with a diﬀerent
EQ source mechanism. The ﬁrst three SES activities M1, M2 and M3 -which have been plotted in Figs. 1(a,b) do
have the same polarity and hence- might be associated with the 3 EQs that have already occurred having the same
mechanism. If this suggestion is correct, the last signal, i.e., M4, with opposite polarity, should correspond to another
EQ with diﬀerent mechanism which has not occurred yet.

We report an empirical determination of the probability density functions Pdata(r) of the number
r of earthquakes in ﬁnite space-time windows for the California catalog. We ﬁnd a stable power law
tail Pdata(r) ∼ 1/r1+µ with exponent µ ≈ 1.6 for all space (5 × 5 to 20 × 20 km2) and time intervals
(0.1 to 1000 days). These observations, as well as the non-universal dependence on space-time
windows for all diﬀerent space-time windows simultaneously, are explained by solving one of the
most used reference model in seismology (ETAS), which assumes that each earthquake can trigger
other earthquakes. The data imposes that active seismic regions are Cauchy-like fractals, whose
exponent δ = 0.1 ± 0.1 is well-constrained by the seismic rate data.

Seismicity is perhaps the best example of a self-
organizing process exhibiting scaling diagnosed with so
many power laws:
the Gutenberg-Richter distribution
∼ 1/E1+β (with β ≈ 2/3) of earthquake energies E; the
Omori law ∼ 1/tp (with p ≈ 1 for large earthquakes)
of the rate of aftershocks as a function of time t since
a mainshock; the productivity law ∼ Ea (with a ≈ 2/3)
giving the number of earthquakes triggered by an event of
energy E [1]; the power law distribution ∼ 1/L2 of fault
lengths L [2]; the fractal structure of fault networks [3]
and of the spatial organization of earthquake epicenters
[4]; the distribution 1/s2+δ (with δ ≥ 0) of seismic stress
sources s in earthquake focal zones due to past earth-
quakes [5]. Related universal laws for the distribution
of waiting times and seismic rates between earthquakes
have recently been derived from the analyses of space-
time windows [6].

Here, we report and explain theoretically an addition
empirical power law: the numbers r of earthquakes in ﬁ-
nite space-time windows for the California SCEC catalog,
over ﬁxed spatial boxes 5×5 km2 to 20×20 km2 and time
intervals dt = 1, 10, 100 and 1000 days are distributed
with a stable power law tail Pdata(r) ∼ 1/r1+µ with ex-
ponent µ ≈ 1.6 for all time intervals. This result has im-
portant implications in constraining the physics of earth-
quakes and in estimating the performance of forecast-
ing models of seismicity. For the former, we show that
this observation can be rationalized by a simple stochas-
tic branching model (ETAS) which uses the above men-
tioned Gutenberg-Richter, Omori, and productivity laws
applied to a fractal spatial geometry of earthquake epi-
centers. The fundamental physical ingredient is that each
earthquake can trigger other earthquakes (“aftershocks”)
and an earthquake sequence results in this model from
the cascade of aftershocks triggered by each past earth-

In addition, the growing eﬀorts in earthquake
forecasts requires estimating the performance of a fore-
casting model by a likelihood function, which are cur-
rently based on Poisson probabilities calculated using
declustered catalogues. Our work shows that sponta-
neous ﬂuctuations of the number of triggered earthquakes
in space-time bins, due to the cascades of triggering pro-
cesses, may lead to dramatic departures from the Poisson
model used as one of the building block of standard test-
ing procedures.

Empirical probability density functions (pdf)
Pdata(r) of the number r of earthquakes in the space-time
bins of size 5 × 5 km2 and dt = 1 days of the SCEC cata-
log. The straight line is the best ﬁt with a pure power law
(1). The continuous line is the theoretical prediction derived
below for dt = 1 days and with no adjustable parameters, as
the parameters are ﬁxed to the values adjusted from the ﬁt
for dt = 1000 days for which the pdf is strongly curved.

In order to maximize the size and quality of the data
used for our analysis, we consider the time interval
1994 − 2003 in a region from approximately 32◦ to 37◦N
in latitude, and from −114◦ to −122◦ in longitude, of
the Southern Californian earthquakes catalog with re-
vised magnitudes ML > 1.5, which contains a total of
86, 228 earthquakes. The spatial domain is covered by
square boxes of (L = 5 km) × (L = 5 km). Other larger
box sizes given similar results. We consider time win-
dows from dt = 1 day to dt = 1000 days. Figure 1 plots
the empirical probability density functions Pdata(r) of the
number r of earthquakes in the space-time bins described
above for dt = 1 days. The straight line is the best ﬁt

over the range 1 ≤ r ≤ 100. Similar power law tails
are present in the tail for the other time windows. The
estimation for µ is stable since the ﬁtted values are µ =
1.65 for dt = 100 days, µ = 1.75 for dt = 10 days and
µ = 1.60 for dt = 1 days. However, the pdf becomes
more and more curved in the larger portion of the bulk
as the size dt of the time window is increased [7]. This
behavior can be explained by the theory described below.
The ETAS (Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence)
model of triggered seismicity is based on the three ﬁrst
well-founded empirical laws mentioned above.
Its ap-
its power of explanation of
peal lies in its simplicity,
other empirical observations (see for instance [8] and ref-
erences therein) and its wide use as a benchmark. The
ETAS model belongs to the general class of branching
processes with inﬁnite variance of the number of proge-
nies per mother, with a long-time (power law) memory of
the impact of a mother on her ﬁrst-generation daughters
described by the empirical Omori law for aftershocks.
These two ingredients together with the mechanism of
cascades of branching have been shown to give rise to
subdiﬀusion and to non mean-ﬁeld behavior in the distri-
bution of the total number of aftershocks per mainshock
[9], in the distribution of the total number of generations
before extinctions and in the distribution of the total du-
ration of an aftershock sequence before extinction [10].

In the ETAS model, each earthquake is a potential pro-
genitor or mother, characterized by its conditional aver-
age number Nm ≡ κµ(m) of children (triggered events or
aftershocks of ﬁrst generation), where µ(m) = 10α(m−m0)
is proportional to the average productivity of an earth-
quake of magnitude m ≥ m0 [1], κ is a constant fac-
tor and m0 is the minimum magnitude of earthquakes
capable of triggering other earthquakes. For a given
earthquake of magnitude m and therefore of mark µ(m),
the number r of its daughters of ﬁrst generation are
drawn at random according to the Poissonian statistics
pµ(r) = N r
e−κµ. The challenge of our
present analysis is to understand how the exponential
Poisson distribution is renormalized into the power law

r! e−Nm = (κµ)r

(1) by taking into account all earthquake triggering paths
simultaneously over all possible generations. The ETAS
model is complemented by the normalized Gutenberg-
Richter (GR) density distribution of earthquake magni-
tudes p(m) = b ln(10) 10−b(m−m0), m ≥ m0. This mag-
nitude distribution p(m) is assumed to be independent of
the magnitude of the triggering earthquake, i.e., a large
earthquake can be triggered by a smaller one. Combin-
ing the GR and the productivity laws shows that the
earthquake marks µ and therefore the conditional aver-
age number Nm of daughters of ﬁrst generation are dis-
tributed according to the normalized power law

pµ(µ) =

µ1+γ ,

1 ≤ µ < +∞,

γ = b/α .

(2)

θcθ

For earthquakes, b ≈ 1 and 0.5 < α < 1 giving 1 < γ < 2.
This range 1 < γ < 2 implies that the mathematical
expectation of µ and therefore of Nm (performed over
all possible magnitudes) is ﬁnite but its variance is inﬁ-
nite. Given γ, the coeﬃcient κ then controls the value of
the average number n (or branching ratio) of children of
ﬁrst generation per mother: n = hNmi = κhµi = κ γ
γ−1 ,
where the average hNmi is taken over all mothers’ mag-
nitudes drawn from the GR law. Recall that the val-
ues n < 1, n = 1 and n > 1 correspond respectively
to the sub-critical, critical and super-critical branching
regimes. The last ingredient of the ETAS model con-
sists in the speciﬁcation of the space-time rate func-
tion Nm Φ(r − ri, t − ti) giving the average rate of ﬁrst
generation daughters at time t and position r created
by a mother of magnitude m ≥ m0 occurring at time
ti and position ri. We use the standard factorization
Φ(x, t) = Φ(t) φ(x). The time propagator Φ(t) has the

ing time scale that ensures that the seismicity rate re-
mains ﬁnite close to the mainshock. The space propa-
gator is φ(x) =
2π(x2+d2)(η+2)/2 . The next ingredient of
the ETAS model is to assume that plate tectonic motion
induces spontaneous mother earthquakes, which are not
triggered by previous earthquakes, according to a Pois-
sonian point process, such that the average number of
spontaneous mother earthquakes per unit time and per

such spontaneous mother earthquake then triggers inde-
pendently its own space-time aftershocks branching pro-
cess. The last ingredient of our theory is to recognize
that, at large scale, earthquakes are preferentially clus-
tered near the plate boundaries while, at smaller scales,
earthquakes are found mostly along faults and close to
nodes between several faults. We thus extend slightly
the ETAS model to allow for the heterogeneity of the
spontaneous earthquake sources ̺ reﬂecting the inﬂuence
of pre-existing fault structures, some rheological hetero-
geneity and complex spatial stress distributions. For this,
we use the distribution of the stress ﬁeld in heteroge-

close to a Cauchy distribution. The simplest prescription
is to assume that ̺ is itself random and distributed ac-
cording to 1

age of the random space-time Poissonian source intensity

Due to the independence between each sequence trig-
gered by each spontaneous event, the generating proba-
bility function (GPF) of the number of events (including
mother earthquakes and all their aftershocks of all gener-
ations), falling into the space-time window {[t, t + τ ] × S}
is equal to

the contribution to the GPF Θsp from aftershocks trig-
gered by mother earthquakes that occurred before the
time window (i.e. at instants t′ such that t′ < t). The
corresponding GPF Θ(z, t − t′, τ, S; x) of the number
of aftershocks triggered inside the space-time window
{[t, t + τ ] × S} by some mother event that occurred at
time t′ = 0 satisﬁes the relation

Θ(z, t, τ, S; x) = G[1 − Ψ(z, t, τ, S; x)] ,

where the auxiliary function Ψ(z, t, τ, S; x), describing
the space-time dissemination of aftershocks triggering by
some mother event, is equal to

The function IS(x) in (5) is the indicator of the space
window S and G(z) in (4) is the GPF of the num-
ber R1 given by (2) of ﬁrst generation aftershocks trig-
gered by some mother earthquake, given by G(z) =
γκγ(1 − z)γ Γ(−γ, κ(1 − z)). The last two summands of
L(z, τ, S) describe the contribution of aftershocks trig-
gered by earthquakes, occurring inside the time window
(i.e., t′ ∈ [t, t + τ ]). The second (resp. third) term cor-
inside)
responds to the subset spatially outside (resp.
the domain S. These last two terms depend on the GPF
Θ(z, τ, S; x) = Θ(z, t = 0, τ, S; x) of the numbers of af-
tershocks triggered till time τ inside the space window S
by some mother event arising at the instant t = 0 and at
the point x. It follows from (4) and (5) that it satisﬁes
the relations

Θ(z, τ, S; x) = G[1 − Ψ(z, τ, S; x)]

Ψ(z, τ, S; x) = Φ(x, τ ) ⊗ [1 − Θ(z, τ, S; x)]
+(1 − z)Φ(x, τ ) ⊗ IS(x)Θ(z, τ, S; x) .

(7)

In addition, we shall need the GPF

Θ(z, S; x) = Θ(z, τ = ∞, S; x)

(8)

of the total numbers of aftershocks triggered by some
mother earthquake inside the area S. As seen from (6)
and (7), it satisﬁes the relations

Θ(z, S; x) = G[1 − Ψ(z, S; x)]

(9)

and Ψ(z, S; x) = 1 − φ(x) ⊗ Θ(z, S; x) + (1 − z)φ(x) ⊗
IS(x)Θ(z, S; x).

Taking into account the distribution of the source in-
tensities ̺ amounts to averaging equation (3) over ̺

. This gives

Θsp(z, τ ; S) = ˆf [h̺i L(z, τ, S)] ,

(10)

where ˆf (u) is the Laplace transform of the pdf f (x).
To go further, we make two approximations.

If the
time duration τ of the space-time window is suﬃciently
large, it can be shown that the statistical averages of
the seismic rates become independent of τ .
It seems
reasonable to conjecture that the GPF Θ(z, τ, S; x) of
the total number of aftershocks triggered by some earth-
quake source inside the space domain S until time τ coin-
cides approximately with the saturated GPF Θ(z, S; x) of
the total number of aftershocks triggered by some earth-
quake source inside the space domain S. Within this
approximation of large time windows, the eﬀect of af-
tershocks triggered by earthquake sources occurring till
the beginning t of the time window is negligible. Within
this large time window approximation, one may ignore
the ﬁrst term in the contribution to (3) and replace
Θ(z, t, S; x) by Θ(z, S; x) in the remaining terms. As a
result, L(z, τ, S) in (3) takes the following approximate

form L(z, τ, S) ≃ τ

[1 − Θ(z, S; x)][1 − IS (x)]dx +

τ

[1 − zΘ(z, S; x)]dx, where Θ(z, S; x) is the solution

of Θ = G [Θ ⊗ φ − (1 − z)ISΘ ⊗ φ]. To ﬁnd a reasonable
approximate expression for the sought GPF Θ(z, S; x),
notice that if the spatial extend ℓ of the window is larger
that the characteristic scale d of the space kernel, or if
n is close to 1, then the characteristic spatial scale as-
sociated with the GPF Θ(z, S; x) becomes greater than
d. Therefore, without essential error, one may replace
Θ ⊗ φ by Θ. In addition, we take into account the ﬁnite-
ness of the domain S by using the factorization proce-
dure: IS (x)Θ(z, S; x) ⊗ φ(x) ≃ Θ(z, S; x) pS(x), where
pS(x) remains to be speciﬁed. This amounts to replacing
a convolution integral by an algebraic term. This factor-
ization approximation is a crucial step of our analysis

and is justiﬁed elsewhere [7]. As a result of its use, the
nonlinear integral equation for Θ(z, S; x) transforms into
the functional equation Θ = G[(1+(z −1)pS(x))Θ]. This
approximation leads to hRi = n
1−n pS, where hRi is the
average of the total number of events in the space-time
window. The eﬀective parameter pS can be determined
from the consistency condition such that hRi be equal to
the true hR(S; x)i, which can be calculated exactly. This
gives

For ℓ ≫ d, the factor pS(x) approaches a rectangular
function. We can use this observation to help determine
the statistics of the number of events in a ﬁnite space-
time window, using the approximation pS(x) ≃ const =
p for x ∈ S. We deﬁne the parameter p as the space
average of pS(x) over the window’s area S:

where Θ(z, p) is the solution of Θ(z; p) = G[(1 + (z −

Complementarily, a study of pS(x) shows that it is
small outside the window space domain S. This implies
that, outside S, one may replace the functional equation
on Θ by 1 − Θ(z, S; x) ≃ n
1−n (1 − z)pS(x). Therefore, we

and using the relationship between the probability
Psp(r; ρ, p) and its GPF in the form of its integral rep-

This expression makes a precise quantitative prediction
for the dependence of the distribution Psp(r; ρ, p) of
the number r of earthquakes per space-time window as
a function of r, once the following model parameters
are given:
the branching ratio n, the exponent γ of
the distribution of productivities, the exponent δ of
the distribution of spontaneous earthquake sources, the
fraction pS of direct (ﬁrst generation) aftershocks which
fall within the domain S, and the average number ρ
of spontaneous earthquake source per space-time bin
deﬁned by ρ = h̺i τ S. The theoretical curve in Fig. 1
is obtained by a numerical integration of Psp(r; ρ, p) =
for the set of parameters n = 0.96, γ = 1.1, pS = 0.25,
δ = 0.15 and ρ = 0.0019 dt with dt in units of days
(thus equal to 100 for Fig. 1 ). These parameters give
the best ﬁt for the large time window dt = 1000 days.
They have been kept ﬁxed for the other time windows
which exhibit very diﬀerent shapes in their bulk. The
theory is thus able to account simultaneously for all the
considered time windows, with no adjustable parameters
for the three smallest time windows [7].

We would also like to stress that, according to our the-
ory, the value of the exponent µ ≈ 1.6 used in (1) to
ﬁt the tails of the distributions of seismic rates is de-
scribing a cross-over rather than a genuine asymptotic
tail. Recall that the distribution of the total number
of aftershocks has two power law regimes ∼ 1/r1+ 1
γ for
r < r∗ ≃ 1/(1 − n)γ/(γ−1) and ∼ 1/r1+γ for r > r∗ [9].
The existence of this cross-over together with the con-
cave shape of the distribution at small and intermediate
values of r combine to create an eﬀective power law with
an apparent exponent µ ≈ 1.6 larger than the largest
asymptotic exponent γ. We have veriﬁed this to be the
case in synthetically generated distributions with gen-
uine asymptotics exponent γ = 1.25 for instance, which
could be well ﬁtted by µ ≈ 1.6 over several decades. We
note also that Pisarenko and Golubeva [11], with a dif-
ferent approach applied to much larger spatial box sizes
in California, Japan and Pamir-Tien Shan, have reported
an exponent µ < 1 which could be associated with the
intermediate asymptotics characterized by the exponent
1/γ < 1, found in our previous analysis [10]. By using
data collapse with varying spatial box sizes on a Califor-
nia catalog, Corral ﬁnds that the distribution of seismic
rates exhibits a double power-law behavior with µ ≈ 0
for small rates and µ ≈ 1.2 for large rates [6]. The ﬁrst
regime might be associated with the non universal bulk
part of the distribution found in our analysis. The second

regime is compatible with the prediction for the asymp-
totic exponent µ = γ. In conclusion, we have oﬀered a
simple explanation of the power law distribution of seis-
mic rates, which is derived from the other known power
laws and the physics of cascades of earthquake triggering.

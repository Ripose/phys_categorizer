Abstract: The statistics of recurrence times in broad areas have been
reported to obey universal scaling laws, both for single homogeneous regions
(Corral, 2003) and when averaged over multiple regions (Bak et al.,2002).
These uniﬁed scaling laws are characterized by intermediate power law asymp-
totics. On the other hand, Molchan (2005) has presented a mathematical
proof that, if such a universal law exists, it is necessarily an exponential, in
obvious contradiction with the data. First, we generalize Molchan’s argument
to show that an approximate uniﬁed law can be found which is compatible
with the empirical observations when incorporating the impact of the Omori
law of earthquake triggering. We then develop the full theory of the statis-
tics of inter-event times in the framework of the ETAS model of triggered
seismicity and show that the empirical observations can be fully explained.
Our theoretical expression ﬁts well the empirical statistics over the whole
range of recurrence times, accounting for diﬀerent regimes by using only the
physics of triggering quantiﬁed by Omori’s law. The description of the statis-
tics of recurrence times over multiple regions requires an additional subtle
statistical derivation that maps the fractal geometry of earthquake epicenters
onto the distribution of the average seismic rates in multiple regions. This
yields a prediction in excellent agreement with the empirical data for rea-
sonable values of the fractal dimension d ≈ 1.8, the average clustering ratio
n ≈ 0.9, and the productivity exponent α ≈ 0.9 times the b-value of the
Gutenberg-Richter law. Our predictions are remarkably robust with respect
to the magnitude threshold used to select observable events. These results
extend previous works which have shown that much of the empirical phe-
nomenology of seismicity can be explained by carefully taking into account
the physics of triggering between earthquakes.

1 Introduction

The concept of “recurrence time” (also called recurrence interval, inter-
event time or return time) is widely used for hazard assessment in seismology.
The average recurrence time of an earthquake is usually deﬁned as the num-
ber of years between occurrences of an earthquake of a given magnitude
in a particular area. Once chosen a probabilistic model for the distribu-
tion of recurrence times (often a Poisson distribution in earlier implementa-
tions, evolving progressively to more realistic distributions), an estimation
of the probability for damaging earthquakes in a given area over a speciﬁc
time horizon can be derived. For instance, the Working Group on Califo-
nia Earthquake Probabilities (2003) assessed a 0.62 probability of a major
damaging earthquake striking the greater San Francisco Bay Region over the
following 30 years (2002-2031). Such calculations are based on classiﬁcations
of known active faults and on assumptions about the organization of seis-
micity on these faults, guided by geological, paleoseismic (see for instance
Sieh, 1981), geodetic evidence (Global Earthquake Satellite System, 2003) as
well as earthquake patterns extracted from recent seismic catalogs. Starting
with the simple assumption that faults are independent and carry their own
characteristic earthquake (Schwartz and Coppersmith, 1984), seismologists
and other scientists working on seismic hazards are realizing that more com-
plex models are needed to take into account the interaction, coupling and
competition between faults (Lee et al., 1999) which translates into a rich
phenomenology in the space-time-magnitude organization of earthquakes.

A new view is now emerging that recurrence times should be considered
for broad areas, rather than for individual faults, and could provide impor-
tant insights in the physical mechanisms of earthquakes. For instance, Wyss
et al. (2000) have proposed to relate an indirect measurement of local re-
currence times within faults to geometrical asperities and stress ﬁeld, thus
signiﬁcantly broadening the standard notion of return time. Inspired by the
scaling approach developed in the physics of critical phenomena (Sornette,
2004), Kossobokov and Mazhkenov (1988), Bak et al. (2002) and Christensen
et al. (2002) have proposed a uniﬁed scaling law combining the Gutenberg-
Richter law, the Omori law and the fractal distribution of epicenters to de-
scribe the distributions of inter-event times between successive earthquakes
in a hierarchy of spatial domain sizes and magnitudes in Southern Califor-
nia. Corral (2003, 2004a,b, 2005a) has reﬁned and extended these analyses
to many diﬀerent regions of the world and has proposed the existence of a
universal scaling law for the probability density function (PDF) H(τ ) of re-
currence times (or inter-event times) τ between earthquakes in a given region

2

S:

H(τ ) ≃ λf (λτ ) .

(1)

The remarkable proposition is that the function f (x), which exhibit diﬀer-
ent power law regimes with cross-overs, is found almost the same for many
diﬀerent seismic regions, suggesting universality. The speciﬁcity of a given
region seems to be captured solely by the average rate λ of observable events
in that region, which ﬁxes the only relevant characteristic time 1/λ for the
recurrence times.

The interpretation proposed by Bak et al.

(2002), Christensen et al.
(2002) and Corral (2003, 2004a,b, 2005a) is that the scaling law (1) reveals
a complex spatio-temporal organization of seismicity, which can be viewed
as an intermittent ﬂow of energy released within a self-organized (critical?)
system, for which concepts and tools from the theory of critical phenomena
can be applied (Corral, 2005b). This view has been challenged by Lindman
et al. (2005) who stressed several methodological caveats (see Corral and
Christensen (2006) for a reply). Livina et al. (2005) have additionally noticed
that the marginal (or mono-variate) PDF of inter-event times gives only a
partial description of the time sequence of earthquakes in a given region, as
it is found to be a function of preceding inter-event times. There is thus a
memory between successive earthquakes which inﬂuences the distribution of
the inter-event times, a conclusion which is well-known to most seismologists.
It is fair to state that there is at present no theoretical understanding
of these empirical results and in particular of expression (1). The situation
becomes even more interesting with the recent mathematical demonstration
by Molchan (2005) that, under very weak and general conditions, the only
possible form for f (x), if universality holds, is the exponential function, in
strong disagreement with the observations reported by Bak et al.
(2002)
In addition, from a re-analysis of the
and Corral (2003, 2004a,b, 2005a).
seismicity of Southern California, Molchan and Kronrod (2005) have shown
that the uniﬁed scaling law (1) is incompatible with multifractality which
seems to oﬀer a better description of the data.

Here, our purpose is to show how all the above can be simply understood

and reconciled from the standard known statistical laws of seismicity:

• (i) the Gutenberg-Richter distribution ∼ 1/E1+β (with β ≈ (2/3)b ≈

2/3) of earthquake energies E (Knopoﬀ et al., 1982);

• (ii) the Omori law ∼ 1/tp (with p ≈ 1 for large earthquakes) of the rate
of aftershocks as a function of time t since a mainshock (Utsu et al.,
1995);

3

• (iii) the productivity law ∼ Ea (with a ≈ 2/3) giving the number
of earthquakes triggered by an event of energy E (Helmstetter et al.,
2005);

• (iv) the fractal (and even probably multifractal (Ouillon et al., 1996))
structure of fault networks (Davy et al, 1990) and of the set of earth-
quake epicenters (Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1980).

The question we address can be summarized as follows: are the statistics on
inter-event times described in (Bak et al., 2002; Corral, 2003, 2004a,b, 2005a;
Livina et al., 2005) really new in the sense that they reveal some information
which is not contained in the above laws (i-iv), as claimed by these authors?
Or can they be derived from the known statistical properties of seismicity,
so that they are only diﬀerent ways of presenting the same information?

In order to address this question, we use the simplest possible model which
combines these four laws, framed as a stochastic point process of past earth-
quakes triggering future earthquakes: the Omori law (ii) is taken to describe
the conditional rate of activation of new earthquakes, given all past earth-
quakes; the Gutenberg-Richter law (i) describes the distribution according
to which the magnitude of a new earthquake is independently determined;
the productivity law (iii) gives the weight of the contribution of a given past
earthquake in the production of new earthquakes. In order to take into ac-
count the fractal geometry of earthquake catalogs, the new earthquakes can
be positioned on a fractal geometry. The elements (i-iii) actually constitute
the basic building block of the benchmark model of seismicity, known as the
Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model of triggered seismicity
(Ogata, 1988; Kagan and Knopoﬀ, 1981), whose main statistical properties
are reviewed in (Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002). Various versions have been
or are currently applied by diﬀerent groups to describe observed and forecast
future seismicity (Console et al., 2002; 2003a,b; 2006; Console and Murru,
2001; Gerstenberger et al., 2005; Reasenberg, P. A. and Jones, 1989; 1994;
Steacy et al., 2005).

The common characteristics of this class of models is to treat all earth-
quakes on the same footing such that one does not assume any distinction
between foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks: each earthquake is con-
sidered to be capable of triggering other earthquakes according to the three
basic laws (i-iii) mentioned above. This hypothesis is based on the realization
that there are no observable diﬀerences between foreshocks, mainshocks and
aftershocks (Jones et al., 1999; Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003a; Helmstetter
et al., 2003), notwithstanding their usual classiﬁcation based in retrospect
analysis of realized seismic sequences: Earthquakes preceding the mainshock

4

are called foreshocks and earthquakes following the mainshock are called af-
tershocks but no physical diﬀerences between these earthquakes are known.
For instance, a mainshock (classiﬁed as the largest event in a given space-
time window) may be re-classiﬁed as a foreshock if a larger event later follows
it; and what would have been an aftershock becomes a mainshock if larger
than all its preceding earthquakes.

In this paper, we use speciﬁcally the ETAS model in the version proposed
by Ogata (1988). The ETAS model assumes that earthquakes magnitudes are
mutually statistically independent and drawn from the Gutenberg-Richter
(GR) probability Q(m). The GR law gives the probability that magnitudes
of triggered events are larger than a given level m (the relationship between
magnitude m and energy is m ∝ (2/3) ln10 E). We shall use the GR law in
the form

Q(m2) = Q(m1)10−b(m2−m1) ,
which emphasizes its scale invariance property. Here b ≃ 1 and m1, m2
are arbitrary magnitudes. We parameterize the (bare) Omori law (Sornette
and Sornette, 1999; Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002) for the rate of triggered
events of ﬁrst-generation from a given earthquake as

(2)

Φ(t) =

θcθ
(c + t)1+θ

(3)

(4)

with θ & 0. One may interpret Φ(t) as the PDF of random times of indepen-
dently occurring ﬁrst-generation aftershocks, triggered by some mainshock
which happened at the origin t = 0. The last ingredient is the productivity
law, which we write in the following convenient form for further analysis,

ρ(m) = κ 10α(m−m0) ,

where the factor κ will be related below to physically observable quantities
such as the average branching ratio n (which is the average number of trig-
gered earthquakes of ﬁrst generation per triggering event). The magnitude
m0 is a cut-oﬀ introduced to regularize the theory (Helmstetter and Sornette,
2002). It can be interpreted as the smallest possible magnitude for earth-
quakes to be able to trigger other earthquakes (Sornette and Werner, 2005a).
Several authors have shown that the ETAS model provides a good description
of many of the regularities of seismicity (Console et al., 2002; 2003a,b; 2006;
Console and Murru, 2001; Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003a,b; Helmstetter et
al., 2005; Gerstenberger et al., 2005; Ogata, 1988; 2005; Ogata and Zhuang,
2006; Reasenberg, P. A. and Jones, 1989; 1994; Saichev and Sornette, 2005;
2006a; Steacy et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2002; 2004; 2005).

Our main result is that, according to Occam’s razor, the previously men-
tioned results on universal scaling laws of inter-event times do not reveal
more information than what is already captured by the well-known laws
(i-iii) of seismicity (Gutenberg-Richter, Omori, essentially), together with
the assumption that all earthquakes are similar (no distinction between fore-
shocks, mainshocks and aftershocks), which is the key ingredient of the ETAS
model. Our theory is able to account quantitatively for the empirical power
laws found by Bak et al. and Corral, showing that they result from subtle
cross-overs rather than being genuine asymptotic scaling laws. We also show
that universality does not strictly hold.

The organization of the paper is the following. In section 2, we discuss
in detail Molchan’s derivation (Molchan, 2005) that, if the scaling law (1)
holds true, then it should be exponential in the sense that f (x) = e−x. We
extend Molchan’s argument by developing a simple semi-quantitative theory,
showing that the presence of the Omori law destroys the self-similarity of the
PDF of recurrence times. Nevertheless, if the exponent of the Omori law (3)
is close to 1, i.e., θ ≪ 1, then, the PDF of recurrence times approximately
obeys a non-exponential scaling law which can ﬁt well the empirical data.
Section 3 extends further the discussion of section 2 by proposing simpliﬁed
models of aftershock triggering process, in the goal of demonstrating the di-
rect relation between the Omori law and the corresponding scaling law for
the PDF of the recurrence times for an arbitrary region. These discussions
allow us to stress the generality of the curve that we propose to the dis-
agreement between Molchan’s result and empirical data. They also prepare
us to understand better the full derivation using the technology of generat-
ing probability functions (GPF) applied to the ETAS model. In section 4,
we analyze the ETAS model of triggered seismicity with the formalism of
GPF and establish the main general results useful for the following. As a
check for the formalism, we obtain the statistical description for the number
of observable events which occur within a given region and during the time
window [t, t + τ ]. Section 5 exploit the general results of section 4 to obtain
predictions on the PDF of recurrence times between observable events in a
single homogeneous region characterized by a well-deﬁned average seismic
rate. A short account of some of these results is presented in (Saichev and
Sornette, 2006c). Section 6 combines the previous results on single regions
to obtain predictions of the PDF of inter-event times between earthquakes
averaged over many diﬀerent regions. In a ﬁrst part, we construct diﬀerent
ad hoc models of the distribution of the average seismic rates of diﬀerent
regions. In a second part, we propose a procedure converting the fractal ge-
ometry of epicenters into a speciﬁc distribution of the average seismic rates
of diﬀerent regions. The knowledge of this distribution allows us to compute

6

the PDF of inter-event times averaged over many regions which is compared
with Bak et al. (2002)’s and Corral (2004a)’s empirical analyses. We ﬁnd
a very good agreement between our prediction and the empirical PDF of
inter-event times.

2 Generalized Molchan’s relation

We start by addressing the puzzle raised by the demonstration by Molchan
(2005) based on a probabilistic reasoning that, under very weak and general
conditions, the only possible form for f (x) in (1), if universality holds, is
the exponential function, in contradiction with the strongly non-exponential
form of the reported seemingly universal uniﬁed PDF (1) for inter-event
times. Here, we brieﬂy reproduce Molchan’s argumentation and then gen-
eralize it to show that the presence of the Omori law, while destroying the
exact uniﬁed law, gives nevertheless an approximate uniﬁed law ﬁtting rather
precisely the real data.

Let P (τ ) be the probability that there are no observable events during
the time interval [t, t + τ ] within some region S. Let us call λ the average
rate of observable events within the region S. Let us assume the existence of
a uniﬁed law

P (τ ) = ϕ(λτ ) ,

(5)

valid for any region. In expression (5), ϕ(x) is the universal scaling function,
which is assumed to be the same for all regions. Following Molchan’s argu-
ment, if an uniﬁed law (5) holds true for any region, then it should be valid
for the region made of the union of two disjoint regions characterized respec-
tively by the rates λ1 and λ2. If the triggering processes of earthquake in
those two regions are statistically independent, then the following functional
equation should be true

ϕ((λ1 + λ2)τ ) = ϕ(λ1τ )ϕ(λ2τ ) .

Posing ψ(x) = ln ϕ(x), the equation (6) is equivalent to

ψ(x) = ψ

λ1
λ1 + λ2

 

x

+ ψ

It is well-known that the solution of equation (7) deﬁnes the class of linear
funtions ψ(x) = −ax for arbitrary a’s, leading to the exponential form

(6)

(7)

(8)

ϕ(x) = e−ax .

7

For the PDF (5), there is a normalization condition that allows us to ﬁx
the constant a. We need ﬁrst to recall a few general results of the theory of
point processes (Daley and Vere-Jones, 1988) Let the random times

. . . t−1, t0, t1, . . . tk . . .

tk+1 > tk > tk−1 . . .

(9)

form a stationary point process with an average rate equal to λ. Then,
the PDF H(τ ) of the inter-event times tk+1 − tk can be obtained from the
following relation

1
λ
where P (τ ) is the already mentioned probability of absence of events within
the interval [t, t + τ ]. The normalization condition for H(τ ) reads

(cid:12)

Substituting with (8) yields a = 1. Thus, following Molchan’s reasoning, if
a uniﬁed law (1) for the PDF of recurrence times exists, then it should be
exponential

f (x) = ϕ′′(x) = e−x .

(12)

We have already mentioned that the law (12) derived by Molchan (2005)
contradicts the observations (Bak et al., 2002; Corral, 2003, 2004a,b, 2005a).
Let us thus generalize Molchan’s reasoning, by assuming that the probability
P (τ ) depends, not only on the dimensionless combination λτ , but addition-
ally on the average rate λ. This means that we assume that the probability
P (τ ) can expressed as

P (τ ) = ϕ(λτ, λ) ,

(13)

for some universal function ϕ. With this assumption, equation (6) is replaced
by

ϕ((λ1 + λ2)τ, λ1 + λ2) = ϕ(λ1τ, λ1)ϕ(λ2τ, λ2) ,

(14)

and expression (7) is changed into

ψ(x, λ1 + λ2) = ψ

λ1
λ1 + λ2

 

x, λ1

+ ψ

λ2
λ1 + λ2

 

x, λ2

(15)

where again ψ = ln ϕ and x is a dimensionless variable. It is easy to check
that the solution of (15) has the form

ψ(x, λ) = −x g

x
λ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

8

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

where g(y) is a function which is arbitrary except that it should be such
that ψ(x, λ) is monotonically decreasing with respect to x. Expression (16)
translates into

P (τ ) = e−λτ g(τ ) .

It is clear from expression (17) that g(τ ) should be dimensionless, hence
its argument must be dimensionless. Since g is independent of λ, the only
possibility to make g(τ ) dimensionless is that it depends on another time
scale c such that g can be written.

where g0(y) is a function with dimensionless argument. This implies that
expression (17) has actually the form

g(τ ) = g0

τ
c (cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

P (τ ) = exp

−λτ g0

(cid:18)

τ
c (cid:19)(cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

which generalizes (8). Note that the later is recovered for the special case
where the function g0 is a constant (which has then to be unity by the
condition of normalization discussed above).

The relevance of a time scale c in addition to the inverse rate 1/λ is
actually part of Omori’s law. Consider the often used pure power form of
the Omori law

Φ(t) = k t−1−θ .
Then, necessarily, for θ 6= 0, a time scale c is needed so that Φ has the
dimension of the inverse of time, i.e.,

(20)

k = k0cθ

(21)

where k0 is a dimensionless constant.

It appears natural on physical grounds (and will be justiﬁed in our cal-
culations below) that the Omori law has an inﬂuence on the form of the
probability P (τ ). This suggests that the physical origin of the time scale
c (and hence of the deviation (19) from Molchan’s law (8)) lies in Omori’s
law. In other words, this argues for the fact that the function g0
in (19)
actually derives from Omori’s law. We thus obtain the key insight that the
existence of the Omori law implies the absence of a universal scaling law for
the PDF of inter-event times!

τ

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

In our calculations presented below using the ETAS model, we will show
that the Omori law gives the following speciﬁc structure for the function
g0(y):

g0(y) = a + hy−θ .

(22)

9

Substituting it into (19) and using the dimensionless variable x = λτ , we
obtain

P (τ ) = ϕ(x, ǫ) = exp

ǫ = λc .

(23)

−ax − ǫθhx1−θ
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

,

A remarkable property of the distribution ϕ(x, ǫ) is that it changes very
slowly for θ ≪ 1, even if the average rate λ changes by factors of thousands.
This characteristic property of ϕ(x, ǫ) is at the origin, as we show below, of
the essentially non-exponential approximate uniﬁed law for the PDF (1) of
recurrence times, which provides excellent ﬁt to the PDF’s of real data.

3 Simpliﬁed model of the impact of Omori’s

law on the PDF of inter-event times

In the preceding section, we have suggested that the Omori law may be at
the origin of both (i) a breaking of the uniﬁed PDF of the inter-event times
from the exponential function derived by Molchan and (ii) an approximate
universal law diﬀerent from the exponential. In the following sections, we will
present a rigorous analysis of the PDF of recurrence times in the framework
of the ETAS model, which conﬁrms this claim. In the present section, we
provide what we believe is a simple intuitive understanding of the roots of the
observed approximate uniﬁed law, by using a simpliﬁed model of recurrence
time statistics which takes into account the impact of the Omori law.

We consider a synthetic Earth in which two types of earthquakes oc-
cur. Spontaneous events are triggered by the driven tectonic forces. In turn,
these spontaneous events (also called “immigrants” in the jargon of branching
processes) may trigger their “aftershocks” (called more generally “triggered
events”). We put quotation marks around “aftershocks” to stress the fact
that those “aftershocks” may be larger than their mother event. They are
not necessarily the aftershocks of the nomenclature of standard seismology.
These triggered events of ﬁrst generation may themselves be the sources of
triggered events of the second generation and so on. We denote ω the Pois-
son rate of the observable spontaneous events. The average number of ﬁrst-
generation “aftershocks,” triggered by some spontaneous event, deﬁnes the
key parameter n of the theory, often called the branching parameter. For the
process to be stationary and not explode, we consider the sub-critical regime
n < 1 (Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002). Note that n is by deﬁnition the aver-
age number of ﬁrst-generation events triggered by any arbitrary earthquake.
It has also the physical meaning of being the fraction of triggered events in
a catalogue including both spontaneous sources and triggered events over all

10

possible generations (Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003c). Given the average
rate ω of the spontaneous sources, the average rate of all events, including
spontaneous and all their children over all generations, is ω(1 + n + n2 + ...),
that is,

λ =

ω
1 − n

.

(24)

In reality, one does not have the luxury of observing all earthquakes. Cat-
alogues are complete only above a minimum magnitude which depends on
the density of spatial coverage of the network of seismic stations and on
their quality. One thus typically observes only a small subset of all occurring
earthquakes, with the vast majority (of small earthquakes) being hidden from
detection. Here, we formulate a simplifying hypothesis, justiﬁed later by a
full rigorous calculation with the ETAS model, that, due to the statistical
independence of the magnitudes of earthquakes, the ratio of the number of
observable spontaneous events to the number of all observable events is ap-
proximately independent of the magnitude threshold m. Assuming this to be
true, then the relation (24) also holds between the rate ω(m) of observable
spontaneous events and the rate λ(m) of the total set of observable events,
whose magnitudes all exceed the threshold level m.

We take into account the inﬂuence of both the spontaneous sources and of
the triggered events on the probability P (τ ) of abscence of events within time
interval [t, t + τ ], by postulating the following generalized Poisson statistics

P (τ ) ≈ exp (−ωτ − ωΛ(τ )) .

(25)

The ﬁrst term ωτ in the exponential is nothing but the standard Poisson
contribution that no spontaneous events fall inside the time interval [t, t + τ ].
The second term ωΛ(τ ) describes the contribution resulting from all the
events which have been triggered before t. Neglecting for simplicity the
diﬀerence of productivity of diﬀerent events, we use the simpliﬁed form

ωΛ(τ ) =

t+τ

λ(t′)dt′ ,

λ(t′) ≈

Φ(t′ − tk) ,

(26)

where Φ(t) is the normalized Omori law described by relation (3). We assume
that the Omori law is self-averaging, so that we can replace λ(t′) by its
average value

Φ(t′ − t′′)dt′′ =

This expression (35) coincides with the previously proposed form (23) with

(36)

The PDF f (x) (36) depends on the scale L of the region S under ob-
servation, via the dependence of the parameter ǫ on the rate λ which itself
depends on L. Similarly, via the same chain of dependence, f (x) is also a
function of the threshold magnitude m of observed events. However, the

12

PDF f (x) given by (36) is very slowly varying with the average rate λ for
θ ≪ 1, which is typical of aftershock sequences. When λ varies by large
factors up to thousands, ǫθ changes insigniﬁcantly. Indeed, let us denote by
λ1 and λ2 the average rates corresponding to two magnitude threshold levels
m1 and m2. Using the GR law, the parameter ǫθ changes by the factor ρ
times (ǫθ

2 = ρǫθ

ρ =

(38)

Consider for instance m2 − m1 = 4, for which the average rate changes by
the huge factor 10−4 while the ρ ≃ 0.76 still remains rather close to 1 for
θ = 0.03. Fig. 1 plots the PDF f (x) given by (36) for n = 0.9, θ = 0.03
and for diﬀerent magnitude thresholds m. This ﬁgure demonstrates the slow
dependence of f (x) with respect to magnitude threshold level m.

While the plots of the approximate scaling law (36) shown in Fig. 1 diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from Molchan’s exponential uniﬁed law, they are close to the
parameterization of the empirical PDF proposed by Corral (2004a)

fc(x) =

with the parameters

γ = 0.67 ± 0.05 ,

δ = 1.05 ± 0.05 ,

a = 1.64 ± 0.15 ,

(39)

and with a normalization factor C close to 1. Fig. 2 shows a typical PDF
f (x) obtained from our expression (36) together with Corral’s ﬁtting curve
(38), illustrating their closeness for not too small x’s. The two expressions
depart for very small x . 0.01, for which our simpliﬁed model distribution
f (x) given by (36) exhibits a power asymptotic f (x) ∼ x−1−θ, which is a
direct consequence of the Omori law. This asymptotic term results explicitely
from the ﬁrst term in the factor multiplying ϕ(x, ǫ) in expression (36). This
asymptotic is absent in Corral’s ﬁtting function fc(x) given by (38), although
it actually exists in real data plots (Corral, 2004a). We will emphasize this
point later when we discuss the full theory and its comparison with the
empirical data.

4 Description of the statistics of observable

events in the context of the ETAS model

In the preceding sections, we have made plausible and intuitively appeal-
ing the possibility that an approximate uniﬁed law indeed exists for the PDF

13

of the inter-earthquake times, by using a simpliﬁed transparent model of the
statistics of recurrence times. In this section, we develop an accurate math-
ematical description of the statistical properties of observable events, in the
framework of the ETAS model presented in the introduction. The technology
developed here will then be used in the next section to quantify precisely the
prediction of the ETAS model of the PDF of inter-event times and to derive
diﬀerent approximations.

Our analysis is based on our previous calculations (Saichev and Sornette,
2006a), which showed that, for large domain sizes (L ∼ tens of kilometers or
more), one may neglect the impact of aftershocks triggered by events that
occurred outside the considered spatial domain S, while only considering the
events within the space domain which are triggered by sources also within
the same domain.
In this approximation validated by precise calculations
in (Saichev and Sornette, 2006a), the analysis of the statistical properties
of time sequence of earthquakes can be reduced to the study of a time-only
version of the ETAS model, in which the dependence on the spatial extension
of a given area can be taken into account via the dependence on L of the
rate ω of spontaneous observable events.

As the ETAS model has an exact representation in terms of branching
clusters (Hawkes and Oakes, 1974; Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002), the
main mathematical tool to analyze the ETAS model in this context is the
Generating Probability Function (GPF) of the random number R(t, τ, m) of
observable events within the time interval [t, t + τ ]

Ω(z; τ, m) = hzR(t,τ,m)i .

(40)

Here and below, the angle brackets h. . . i represent the procedure of statistical
averaging. We assume that the process of earthquake triggering is stationary,
so that the GPF given by (40) does not depend on t but only on the duration
τ of the time interval [t, t + τ ]. Let P (r, τ, m) be the probability that the
number R(t, τ, m) of observable events is equal to r. Then, one may rewrite
the deﬁnition (40) in the equivalent form

Ω(z; τ, m) =

P (r; τ, m)zr .

(41)

Xr=0
It follows that the probability that no event occurs in a time interval of
duration τ is equal to

P (τ ) = P (r = 0, τ, m) = Ω(0; τ, m) .

(42)

To determine the GPF Ω(z; τ, m0) associated with the total number of
events inside the time window [t, t + τ ], we proceed as follows. We partition

∞

14

the t-axis in small intervals Ik = [tk, tk + ∆] as shown in Fig. 3 and then
group them in three categories: the ﬁrst one Ik1 ∈ (−∞, t) lies before the
time window [t, t+τ ] of interest, the second one Ik2 ∈ [t, t+τ ] groups all small
intervals inside the time window [t, t + τ ] and the third one Ik3 ∈ (t + τ, ∞)
lies after the time window [t, t+τ ]. Let us now determine in turn the impacts
of the spontaneous events occurring within each of these three intervals on
the GPF of the number of events inside the time window [t, t + τ ]. Let
Θk1(z; , m0) be the GPF of the number of spontaneous events occurring in
the ﬁrst class Ik1 of small intervals. It is equal to

∞

Θk1(z; m0) =

P(r, ∆)zr ,

(43)

Xr=0
where P(r, ∆) is the Poissonian probability that r spontaneous events occur
in Ik1. It is given by

(ω∆)r
r!
Let us recall that, according to the ETAS model, spontaneous and trig-
gered events have statistically independent magnitudes whose PDF is to GR
law

P(r, ∆) =

e−ω∆ .

(44)

p(m) = −

Thus, the spontaneous earthquakes have statistically independent magni-
tudes {mj}, j = 1, 2, . . . , r. According to the branching property of the ETAS
model (Hawkes and Oakes, 1974; Helmstetter and Sornette, 2002), these
spontaneous events trigger statistically independent numbers Rj(tk, t, τ, mj, m0)
of events within time interval [t, t + τ ]. This remark allows us to obtain the
GPF Ωk1(z; τ, m0) of the random number of events within [t, t + τ ] triggered
by spontaneous events which occurred inside a given small interval Ik1: by
replacing in (43) the term zr by

Here,

is the GPF of the random numbers of events triggered inside the time interval
[t, t + τ ] by some spontaneous event of magnitude m′ which occurred at a

(48)

15

time tk1 < t. Due to the statistical independence of the random numbers
of events triggered by diﬀerent spontaneous events which belong to diﬀerent
small intervals Ik1, the GPF of the random numbers of events (including all
their “aftershocks”), triggered within the interval [t, t + τ ] by spontaneous
events which occurred before the window [t, t + τ ], is equal to

Ω1(z; τ, m0) =

Analogously, one can ﬁnd the GPF Ω2(z; τ, m0) of the number of win-
dowed events (including all their “aftershocks”) triggered by spontaneous
events which occurred within the interval [t, t + τ ]. It reads

is the GPF of the random number of events triggered inside the interval

(52)

For the third contribution from spontaneous sources in Ik3 ∈ (t + τ, ∞),

the causality principle implies that Θk3 ≡ 1.

Thus, the whole GPF of the numbers of events occurring within the time
interval [t, t + τ ] is Ω(z; τ, m0) = Ω1(z; τ, m0)Ω2(z; τ, m0), which can be writ-

The above GPF’s take into account events which have arbitrary magni-
tudes m′ > m0. In order to get the GPF (40) which only counts observable
events with magnitudes larger than some threshold level m, one has to re-
place (i) m0 by m in the r.h.s of expressions (53) and (54) and (ii) z by

z(m′, m) = H(m − m′) + zH(m′ − m) ,
where H(x) is unit step (Heaviside) function. We also replace the GPF
Θ(z; t, τ, m′, m0) by the GPF Θ(z; t, τ, m′, m) of the number of observable
aftershocks (whose magnitudes are larger than m), triggered by a mainshock
of magnitude m′. We thus obtain

Equations (62) and (63) are rather complicated nonlinear integral equa-
tions. For the rest of this section, we use them together with expressions
(59), (60) only to derive the average number of observable earthquakes. In
the next sections, we exploit them fully to obtain the PDF of the inter-event
times.

As recalled for instance in the Appendix of (Saichev and Sornette, 2006a),

5 Statistics of recurrence times in the con-
text of the ETAS model: accounting for
Corral’s empirical analyses

We now use the formalism developed in the preceding section to derive
the probability P (τ ) given by (42) that no event occurs with a time interval
of duration τ . Using (59), (60), (61), it is equal to

where

Z

N(t, τ, m) = 1 − D(t, τ, m) ,

N−(τ, m) = 1 − D(τ, m) + D+(τ, m) .

These functions have a clear probabilistic interpretation. For instance, N(t, τ, m)
is the probability that some spontaneous earthquake, which occurred at time
t = 0, will trigger at least one observable event (which can be an aftershock
of arbitrary generation) within the time window [t, t + τ ] (t > 0).

It follows from (62) that the probability N(t, τ, m) satisﬁes the equation

1 − Ψ [Φ(t) ⊗ N(t, τ, m) + Φ(t + τ ) ⊗ N−(τ, m)] .

Analogously, it follows from (63) that N−(τ, m) satisﬁes the equation

N(t, τ, m) =

N−(τ, m) =

1 − Ψ [Φ(τ ) ⊗ N−(τ, m)] + Q(m)Ψ

Q−1/γ(m)Φ(τ ) ⊗ N−(τ, m)
h
These are still rather complicated nonlinear integral equations. We can
simplify them by linearization, which provides a reasonable approximation,
as can be seen from the following argument. First, we notice that the in-
equalities obviously hold

i

.

N(t, τ, m) < N(m) ,

N−(τ, m) < N−(m) ,

(81)

where

N(m) = N(t = 0, τ = ∞, m) ,

N−(m) = N−(τ = ∞, m) .

(82)

20

(76)

(77)

(78)

(79)

(80)

The majorants N(m) and N−(m) satisfy the following nonlinear functional
equations derived from from (79), (80):

N(m) = 1 − Ψ[N−(m)] ,

N−(m) = 1 − Ψ[N−(m)] + Q(m)Ψ[Q−1/γ(m)N−(m)] .

(83)

We have solved numerically these equations (83) and Fig. 4 plots these solu-
tions for N(m) and N−(m). One can observe that, even for moderate mag-
nitude thresholdss m − m0 & 1, both N(m) ≪ 1 and N−(m) ≪ 1, so that,
with the inequalities (81), one can be conﬁdent that a linear approximation
of the r.h.s. of equations (79), (80) should provide a good approximation.

The linear approximation of equations (79) and (80) amounts to replace
the function Ψ(y) deﬁned in (64) by the ﬁrst two terms of the expansion (65):

Ψ(y) ≈ 1 − ny .

(84)

This approximation (84) has a transparent probabilistic interpretation.
It
corresponds to assuming that any given earthquake can either trigger no
or just one observable aftershock of ﬁrst-generation. However, through the
avalanche process of aftershocks which themselves trigger no or just one af-
tershock, the total average number hRi = n/(1 − n) of aftershocks over all
generations which are triggered by a given mainshock can still be large for
n close to 1. A possible justiﬁcation of the approximation that no more
than one observable ﬁrst-generation aftershock is triggered by a given event
is that this statement refers to observable aftershocks with magnitudes above
the threshold level m > m0. For m large enough above m0, a given main-
shock may trigger many aftershocks of ﬁrst generation of magnitude larger
than m0, but few of them will be observable with magnitudes larger than
m, due to the fast decay of the GR PDF (2) with increasing m. This eﬀect
has been shown to lead to a renormalization of the branching ratio n into
an apparent value na ≤ n (the equality holding only for the two ﬁxed points
n = 0 and n = 1), characterizing the apparent branching structure of the
triggering of observable events (Sornette and Werner, 2005b; Saichev and
Sornette, 2006b).

With the linear approximation (84), equation (80) takes the form

N−(τ, m) = Q(m) + δΦ(τ ) ⊗ N−(τ, m) ,

where

δ = n[1 − Q

γ−1
γ (m)] .

Similarly, expression (79) allows us to obtain

(85)

(86)

N(t, τ, m) = nΦ(t) ⊗ N(t, τ, m) + nΦ(τ + t) ⊗ N−(τ, m) .

which coincides with the simpliﬁed model probability (32) derived in section
3. The conditions under which this approximation holds can be visualized
from Fig. 5 showing the dependence of of δ, taking as a function of m − m0
for diﬀerent values of γ = b/α. This dependence results from the competition
between the decay of the GR law controlled by its exponent b and the value
of the productivity exponent α.

Fig. 5 shows that the condition δ ≪ 1 needed to obtain (102) requires
that m − m0 should not be too large, while Fig. 4 has shown that the linear
approximation (84) used to obtain these results is all the more valid the larger
is m−m0. It is thus worthwhile to come back to the more complete expression
(101) for P (τ ), which holds for arbitrary values of δ.

Similarly to the observation that the simpliﬁed version (36) for the PDF
of recurrence times depends very slowly on the magnitude threshold m, the
PDF of inter-event times (108) predicted by the ETAS model also depends
weakly on m, if θ ≪ 1 and γ is close to 1. Fig. 6 plots the dependence
of the PDF (108) as a function of the dimensionless inter-event time x for
θ = 0.03, γ = 1.2 and n = 0.9 for diﬀerent magnitude thresholds m = 2, 4, 6.
For such a span of magnitude thresholds, the average rate (103) changes by
many orders of magnitudes, while the corresponding PDF’s are amazingly
close each other. Fig. 6 indeed exampliﬁes the very weak dependence of the
PDF on m.

Fig. 7 shows the empirical PDF’s of the scaled inter-event times con-
structed by Corral (2004a), as well as Corral’s ﬁtting curves using expression
(38). We superimpose on these curves our theoretical prediction (108), which
actually provides a better ﬁt to the data, especially for small x . 10−2, where
our ETAS prediction correctly accounts for the impact of Omori’s law, as al-
ready mentioned in our discussion of the simpliﬁed model PDF (36). We
present the theoretical prediction (108) for two diﬀerent magnitude thresh-
old levels m − m0 = 2 and 6, showing the very weak dependence on the
magnitude of completeness. These results suggest that the parameter θ of
the (bare) Omori law needs to be small (typically θ . 0.1) to account for
the data. Similar ﬁts are obtained for the range of parameters 1 < γ ≤ 1.2

24

and 0.8 ≤ n < 1, in agreement with bounds previously obtained from the
prediction of the ETAS model on the distribution of seismic rates (Saichev
and Sornette, 2006a).

6 PDF of recurrence times for multiple re-
gions: accounting for Bak et al. (2002)’s
empirical analysis

Until now, we have derived the prediction of the ETAS model for the
statistics of inter-event times in a single homogeneous region and have shown
that it is compatible with the empirical observation of an approximate uni-
ﬁed scaling law of the form (5). We have also shown that our theoretical
expression ﬁts remarkably well the empirical PDF’s over the whole range of
recurrence times, accounting for diﬀerent regimes by using only the physics
of triggering quantiﬁed by Omori’s law.

There is another uniﬁed saling law for the statistics of recurrence time
obtained after averaging over multiple regions, which has been proposed by
Kossobokov and Mazhkenov (1988) and Bak et al. (2002). We will refer for
short to this law as Bak et al.’s uniﬁed law. The aim of this section is to
derive analytically Bak et al.’s uniﬁed law obtained for multiple regions based
on the prediction of the ETAS model that we have presented in the previous
section and on the simple hypothesis that all regions obey the PDF form
(108) but with diﬀerent average seismic rates. This simply means that Bak
et al.’s uniﬁed law in our view just results from an appropriate averaging
of expression (108) over the statistics of the average rates of the multiple
regions under observation.

We ﬁrst present in subsection 6.1 a general scheme to perform this aver-
aging in the next subsection with various test statistics for the average rates
in diﬀerent regions. Then, in the second subsection 6.2, we introduce a frac-
tal geometrical model which allows us to propose a speciﬁc statistics for the
average rates in diﬀerent regions, which lead to excellent ﬁts to the empirical
data.

6.1 General statistics for the average regional seismic

rates

In order to choose reasonable statistics for the average seismic rates ωi
in multiple regions with the minimum of additional parametes, we assume
that these ωi’s obey a principle of statistical self-similarity: if the branching

25

ratios ni’s and the linear size Li’s of diﬀerent regions are identical, then the
seismic rates can be written

ωi = ¯ω ui ,

(109)

where ¯ω is the rate of spontaneous events averaged over all regions, while the
ui’s are mutually independent random variables distributed according to the
same PDF E(u). The PDF E(u) is assumed to be independent of the common
values of the branching ratio n and linear size L of the multiple regions.
Additionally, we assume that, as for the scaling law (5) of a single region, the
PDF E(u) does not depend on the magnitude threshold m (which is common
to all regions). One may interpret this assumption as a consequence of the
scaling properties of the GR law.

Since the average rates of spontaneous events cannot be directly observed,
it may be preferable to replace the statement (109) by the equivalent repre-
sentation

λi = ¯λ ui ,

(110)

which involves the total observable seismic rates above a magnitude thresh-
old. Due to (110), the PDF E(u) should satisfy to double normalization
condition

In this subsection, we concentrate our attention on the universal properties
of the PDF of recurrence times constructed over multiple regions, which
are found almost the same for qualitatively diﬀerent distributions E(u). In
the next subsection 6.2, we will obtain a speciﬁc expression for the PDF
E(u) from a simple model based on a fractal distribution of spontaneous
earthquake sources.

Applying our conjecture (110) to the general relation (10), the PDF of

inter-event times over multiple regions is obtained as

where g(y, m, θ) is given by (105). Substituting (113) into (112) yields the

It is possible to derive the following asymptotic behavior of the PDF h(x)
(117). Below, we will illustrate the main features of these asymptotics using
the limiting case δ = 0 and τ ≫ c such that K(x) reduces to

K(x) ≈ (1 − n)x +

n
1 − θ

ǫθx1−θ ,

(119)

corresponding to the simpliﬁed model of recurrence time statistics.

Let us ﬁrst consider the behavior of h(x) for x ≪ 1. First, the asymptotic
behavior of the dimensionless PDF h(x) for x ≪ 1 is universal in the sense
that it does not depend on the shape of the PDF E(u) of the average rates
of the multiple regions. Indeed, due to the double normalization condition
(111), we have

E(K) ≃ E1(K) ≃ 1

(K ≪ 1) .

(120)

Thus, in view of (117) and (119), we obtain

h(x) ≈ (1 − n + n¯ǫ θx−θ)2 + θn¯ǫ θx−1−θ

(x ≪ 1) .

(121)

For very small x’s, the last term prevails and we have the universal asymptotic

h(x) ≈ θn¯ǫ θx−1−θ ,

x ≪ x∗ ≪ 1 .

(122)

The range of validity of this asymptotic can be roughly estimated by putting
formally ¯ǫ θx−θ ≈ 1 in the r.h.s. of relation (121), which gives

h(x) ≈ 1 + θnx−1

(123)

27

so that

x∗ ≈ θn .

(124)

Let us now consider the behavior of h(x) for x ≫ 1. We observe an
almost universal asymptotic of the dimensionless PDF h(x) given by (117)
for x ≫ 1. Indeed, let us assume that the PDF of the average seismic rates
of the multiple regions has, for small u, the following power asymptotic

E(u) ≈ µuα ,

u ≪ 1 .

(125)

This leads to the explicit form of the Laplace transforms (118):

ˆE(x) ≃ µΓ(1 + α)x−1−α ,

ˆE1(x) ≃ µΓ(2 + α)x−2−α ,

x ≫ 1 . (126)

This ﬁnally yields

h(x) ≈ µΓ(1 + α)×

(1 + α)(1 − n + n¯ǫ θx−θ)2K −2−α(x) + θn¯ǫ θx−1−θK −1−α(x)
h

i

.

For small θ, the leading behavior of this asymptotic can be obtained by using
K(x) ≈ x, which gives

h(x) ∼ x−2−α .

A useful overview of the behavior of the dimensionless PDF h(x) valid for
all interdiate values x, including the two above asymptotics (122) and (128),
can be obtained by considering a smoothed function interpolating between
them. Let us for instance consider the following modeling function

(127)

(128)

(129)

hm(x) =

1 + θnx−1−θ
1 + x2+α

.

We put here for simplicity µΓ(2 + α) ≈ 1. Fig. 8 shows the function xhm(x)
for θ = 0.03, n = 0.9 and for diﬀerent values α, which mimics the empirical
construction reported by Bak et al. (2002). Note in particular the existence
of a plateau for x ≪ 1, corresponding to the Omori law asymptotic (122).
One can also observe the power law asymptotic x−1−α, corresponding to the
asymptotic (128) for x ≫ 1. In addition, there is an intermediate kink for
x ≃ 1, due to the ﬁrst term of the asymptotic formula (123). All three
features mimic the behavior found by Bak et al. (2002).

These properties of h(x) are weakly dependent on the value of the ex-
ponent α, which controls the asymptotic behavior (125) of the PDF of the
average seismic rates of the multiple regions for small rates. To illustrate this
point, consider two qualitatively diﬀerent sample distributions E(u) which

28

(130)

(131)

(132)

(133)

(134)

(135)

obey the double normalization (111). Our ﬁrst example is the Gamma dis-
tribution formulated so that it obeys (111):

E g(u) =

(1 + α)1+α
Γ(1 + α)

uαe−(1+α)u .

The main properties of this distribution are the presence of a power asymp-
totic (125) for small u’s and an exponential decay for u ≫ 1. In this case,
the Laplace transforms (118) are

ˆE g(x) =

1 + α
1 + α + x (cid:19)

(cid:18)

1+α

,

ˆE g
1 (x) =

1 + α
1 + α + x (cid:19)

(cid:18)

2+α

.

Our second example for a distribution obeying (111) is

E p(u) =

p + 1

1 +

p  

u
p !

−2−p

,

which corresponds to the particular case α = 0. The main diﬀerence between
this distribution and the previous Gamma distribution is the slowly decaying
power law tail for u ≫ 1:

E p(u) ∼ u−p−2

(u ≫ 1) .

In this case, the Laplace transforms (118) read

and

ˆE p(x) = (1 + p)(px)1+pepxΓ(−1 − p, px)

ˆE p
1 (x) =

1
x

(1 + p − (1 + p + px)Ep(x)) .

Fig. 9 plots the PDF h(x) obtained with the two examples (130) and (132). It
would be diﬃcult to distinguish between these two distributions in a realistic
empirical setting with limited data and large statistical ﬂuctuations.

In the next subsection 6.2, we develop a simple model for E(u) based
on the idea that seismic rates of spontaneous events are distributed on a
fractal geometrical set. In a nutshell, the key idea is the following: a spatial
distribution of spontaneous events with fractal dimension d < 2 implies that,
the larger is the number of events, the larger are the spatial distances between
them. Thus, the PDF of the number R of events within a given region
should decay quite fast at the number of events increases. This tends to
favor the decay for large seismic rates modelled by the Gamma distribution
(130) over the power law distribution (132). To ﬁnish this general discussion,

29

we present in Fig. 10 the empirical data analyses by Corral (2004a) together
with prediction for h(x) obtained by using the Gamma distribution for E(u)
with θ = 0.03, n = 0.9, ǫ = 0.76 and α = 0.2. The ﬁts to the empirical data
are suggestive as they captures all its qualitative features. There are however
undeniable quantitative diﬀerences which result in part from the fact that
the Gamma distribution is probably not the true distribution for E(u) even
if it captures correctly the mean properties of the data.

6.2 Probabilistic consequences of the fractal geometry
of the spatial distribution of spontaneous earth-
quakes

In the framework of the ETAS model combined with the hypothesis of
statistical self-similarity, the preceding subsection 6.1 has stressed that an
analytical understanding of Bak et al.’s uniﬁed law requires the knowledge
of the PDF E(u) of the average rates over the multiple regions. To constrain
its structure, we make the assumption that the well-known fractal spatial
organization of all observed earthquakes reﬂects a similar fractal spatial or-
ganization of the subset of spontaneous events which are the origin of the
earthquake triggering activity. We thus assume that spontaneous events are
distributed spatially on a fractal geometry, which we are going to exploit to
derive a natural form for the PDF E(u).

For this goal, the key idea is based on an important relation between two
reciprocal random variables. The ﬁrst random variable is the area S(k) occu-
pied by k spontaneous events which occurred during a ﬁxed time interval of
duration τ . The second random variable k(S) is the inverse function of S(k),
which is nothing but the number of spontaneous events within the given area
S. Although both functions are ill-deﬁned in practice due to the diﬃculties
in deﬁning unambiguously the areas occupied by chaotically occurring dis-
seminated events, we can nevertheless obtain approximate scaling laws for
the distributions of these two variables, which derive from the fact that the
average k(S), which is proportional to the rate of spontaneous events ω(s),
should obey to power law

hk(S)i ∼ ω(S) ∼ Ld .

(136)

Here, L is a characteristic scale of the area S and d is the fractal dimension
of the spatial set of spontaneous events.

In order to obtain these scaling laws, we recognize that the i-th sponta-
neous event “occupies” a spatial area si such that, if some area S contains k

30

spontaneous events, then it is equal to

S(k) ≈ s1 + s2 + · · · + sk .

(137)

One may interpret si as given by si ≈ L2
i where Li is the distance between the
i-th event and its nearest neighbor. Next, let us assume that the summands
in (137) are statistically independent with a common PDF v(s) which has
the following aymptotic power law

v(s) ≈ η

d
Γ(1 − d)

s−1−g ,

s → ∞ 0 < g < 1 .

(138)

The expression (138) corresponds to a distribution of spatial jumps, as in a
so-called L´evy ﬂights (Metzler and Klafter, 2000), which underlies the fractal
spatial distribution of spontaneous events. From the generalized central limit
theorem (Gnedenko and Kolmogorov, 1954; Sornette, 2004), the PDF of the
random sum (137) for k ≫ 1 is given asymptotically by

Vk(s) ≈

1
(ηk)1/g fg

s
(ηk)1/g !

 

,

k ≫ 1 ,

(139)

where fg(x) is an inﬁnitely divisible distribution, whose Laplace transform is
equal to

ˆfg(y) =

fg(x)e−yxdx = e−vg

,

0 < g < 1 .

(140)

∞

0
Z

Let us now view expression (137) from a diﬀerent vantage. One can also

interpret (137) as an implicit equation

S(k) = S

(141)

for the unknown variable equal to the number k(S) of spontaneous events
occurring within the given area S. Piryatinska et al.
(2005) have shown
that the PDF of the random variable S allows one to derive the PDF of the
random variable k(S) as

W (k; S) =

η
Sg wg

ηk

where

1
gx1+1/g fg
We then deduce that the average of the random variable k(S) distributed
according to the PDF (142) is given by

wg(x) =

Since S ≈ L2 in (144) and comparing with (136) yields the self-consistent

determination of the exponent g

(149)

(150)

which is indeed between 0 and 1 for 0 < d < 2. Assuming that average rates
of single regions are proportional to k(S), that is λ ∼ ω ∼ k(S), we obtain

g = d/2 ,

λi = ¯λui ,

ui =

where Si are diﬀerent regions with the same linear size L. The sought PDF
of the average seismic rates is thus equal to

ˆE(x) deﬁned by (118) as

Fig. 12 for three diﬀerent values d = 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 of the fractal dimension of
earthquake epicenters.

Fig. 13 is the culmination of the present work.

It ﬁrst makes use of
our theoretical analysis based on the ETAS model leading to the prediction

32

(108) for a single homogeneous seismc region, which is combined for mul-
tiple regions with diﬀerent seismic rates distributed according to the PDF
(147) predicted from our fractal model of earthquake epicenters, to ﬁnally
obtain the global PDF (117) of inter-event times. Our ﬁnal prediction (117)
is compared to the empirical distribution represented in Fig. 2 of (Corral,
2004a), for the parameters d = 1.8, n = 0.9, γ = 1, 1 and to 3 values of the
magnitude threshold m − m0 = 2; 4; 6. The agreement is remarkable.

7 Concluding remarks

We have proposed a general theoretical approach to describe the statis-
tics of recurrence times between successive earthquakes in a given region, or
averaged over multiple regions. This work was motivated by the reports by
several authors that recurrence times between successive earthquakes should
be considered for broad areas, rather than for individual faults, and could pro-
vide important insights in the physical mechanisms of earthquakes. Several
authors mainly from the Physics literature have proposed that the scaling law
(1) found to describe well empirical data reveals a complex spatio-temporal
organization of seismicity, which can be viewed as an intermittent ﬂow of
energy released within a self-organized (perhaps critical) system, for which
concepts and tools from the theory of critical phenomena can be applied.

We have shown that this view is probably too romantic because much
simpler explanations can be proposed to fully account for the empirical ob-
servations. Indeed, we have shown that the so-called universal scaling laws of
inter-event times do not reveal more information than what is already cap-
tured by the well-known laws of seismicity (Gutenberg-Richter and Omori,
essentially), together with the assumption that all earthquakes are similar
(no distinction between foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks). This con-
clusion is reached by a combination of analyses, which start from a gener-
alization of Molchan (2005)’s argument, to go to simple models of triggered
seismicity taking into account Omori’s law, and end with a detailled study of
what the ETAS model has to tell us on the statistics of inter-event times. By
using the formalism of generating probability functions, we have been able
to derive analytically speciﬁc predictions for the PDF of recurrence times
between earthquakes in a single homogeneous region as well as for multi-
ple regions. Our theory has been found to account quantitatively precisely
for the empirical power laws found by Bak et al. (2002) and Corral (2003;
2004a). We showed in particular that the empirical statistics of inter-event
times result from subtle cross-overs rather than being genuine asymptotic
scaling laws. We also showed that universality does not strictly hold.

33

Therefore, to the question raised in the introduction, we are led to con-
clude that the statistics on inter-event times described in (Bak et al., 2002;
Corral, 2003, 2004a,b, 2005a; Livina et al., 2005) is not really new in the
sense that they do not reveal information which is not already contained in
the known laws of seismicity. Our conclusion is that they can be derived from
the known statistical properties of seismicity, so that they are only diﬀerent
In particular, the fact that the
ways of presenting the same information.
simple models of Lindman et al. (2005) are not able to fully reproduce the
structure of the empirical statistics of recurrence times, as noted by Corral
and Christensen (2006), does not necessarily imply that the so-called “uni-
ﬁed scaling laws” reveal any novel information. We think we have clearly
shown that they can be derived from simple and well-known physical ingre-
dients, when carefully taking into account the physics of triggering between
earthquakes. In this sense, the present work is the continuation of an eﬀort
to classify the empirical observations which can be, from those which cannot
be, explained by the simple ETAS benchmark (Helmstetter and Sornette,
2003a; 2003b; Saichev and Sornette, 2005; 2006a). With this eﬀort, we hope
to eventually help identify real robust statistics which can not be explained
by the ETAS benchmark or its siblings, leading us towards the acquisation

d = 1.8, n = 0.9, γ = 1, 1 and three values of the threshold magnitude
m − m0 = 2; 4; 6. Corral calculated the recurrence-time probability densi-
ties following Bak et al. (2002)’s procedure, after rescaling by the regional
seismic rates. 84 distributions are shown, with region sizes L ranging from
0.039◦ to 45◦, and threshold magnitudes m varying between 1.5 and 6. The
curves are shifted by factors 1; 10−2; 10−4 and 10−6, and correspond to: 1

1995-1998, and Spain, 1993-1997; 4 (bottom), New Zealand, 1996-2001, and
New Madrid, 1975-2002. The thin straight lines are Corral’s ﬁts by power
laws of the short or intermediate times: 1 (top), 0.12/x0.95; 2, 0.15/x0.9, 3
and 4 (bottom), 0.05/x0.95 and 0.5/x0.5. In all cases, Corral has ﬁtted the
long-time tail by 0.25/x2.2. The times in the horizontal axis span from 2 min
to about 20 years. Recurrence times smaller than 4, 10, and 2 min are not
shown, for Japan, NEIC, and the rest of catalogs, respectively.

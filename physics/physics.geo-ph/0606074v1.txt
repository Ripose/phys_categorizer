COMPUTATION OF A COMBINED SPHERICAL-ELASTIC AND
VISCOUS-HALF-SPACE EARTH MODEL FOR ICE SHEET SIMULATION

ED BUELER1, CRAIG S. LINGLE2, AND JED A. KALLEN-BROWN1

Abstract. This report starts by describing the continuum model used by Lingle & Clark
(1985) to approximate the deformation of the earth under changing ice sheet and ocean
loads. That source considers a single ice stream, but we apply their underlying model to
continent-scale ice sheet simulation. Their model combines Farrell’s (1972) elastic spherical
earth with a viscous half-space overlain by an elastic plate lithosphere. The latter half-space
model is derivable from calculations by Cathles (1975). For the elastic spherical earth we
use Farrell’s tabulated Green’s function, as do Lingle & Clark. For the half-space model,
however, we propose and implement a signiﬁcantly faster numerical strategy, a spectral
collocation method (Trefethen 2000) based directly on the Fast Fourier Transform. To
verify this method we compare to an integral formula for a disc load. To compare earth
models we build an accumulation history from a growing similarity solution from (Bueler,
et al. 2005) and and simulate the coupled (ice ﬂow)-(earth deformation) system.
In the
case of simple isostasy the exact solution to this system is known. We demonstrate that the
magnitudes of numerical errors made in approximating the ice-earth system are signiﬁcantly
smaller than pairwise diﬀerences between several earth models, namely, simple isostasy, the
current standard model used in ice sheet simulation (Greve 2001, Hagdorn 2003, Zweck
& Huybrechts 2005), and the Lingle & Clark model. Therefore further eﬀorts to validate
diﬀerent earth models used in ice sheet simulations are, not surprisingly, worthwhile.

1. Two linear earth models and their Green’s functions

Lingle & Clark (1985) use as their fundamental tools the Green’s functions of two diﬀerent
linear earth models. The Green’s functions for these models are convolved with the load to
compute (vertical) displacements of the earth’s surface. One ﬁnds an elastic displacement
uE and a viscous displacement uV given a current load and a load history, respectively, as
we will explain. The total displacement is then the sum u = uE + uV at any time. That is,
the two linear models are superposed.

The partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) behind these Green’s functions are linear. In
this report we state these PDEs, which is, in the case of the second model, a nontrivial
accomplishment (see section 3). We then approximately solve these PDEs in a demonstra-
bly eﬃcient manner. First, however, we describe the two models and their sources in the
literature.

An elastic, self-gravitating spherical earth. The main equations of this model are

(ρ s) er + ρ¨s = 0,

Here ρ = ρ(r) is the density of the earth. (We restrict to only radial dependence because
the densities used by (Farrell 1972) are for “stratiﬁed” earths.) Also, g is the acceleration
of gravity, τ is the full stress tensor, and s is the displacement vector ﬁeld (i.e. the strain
ﬁeld) which we seek. The gravitational potential φ is described below. Note that ˙s = u is
the velocity ﬁeld and that ¨s is just the acceleration.

The ﬁrst equation comes from formally linearizing the equation of conservation of momen-
tum. The second equation is for the gravitational potential. The ﬁeld φ is the additional
gravitational potential “on top of” that caused by the undeformed earth and also additional
to the potential of any masses outside the earth (including the load).
In Farrell’s words
“. . . φ is the perturbation in the ambient graviational potential φ1 plus the potential of any
externally applied graviational force ﬁeld φ2.”

Actually, equation (27) in (Farrell 1972) has “

ω2ρ s” where we have “ρ¨s” because Farrell
only states the Fourier-transformed-in-time equations. We will only be interested in the
¨s = 0, equivalently ω = 0 case, however, because we are interested in phenomena on the
scale of years or centuries, unlike Farrell who was interested in tides.

Consider point forces or disk loads at the surface. For such loads it is natural to use
spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ) where the z-axis is along the line between the center of the
earth and the center of the load. Here θ is the angle between the position vector and the
z-axis (i.e. the colatitude) and ϕ is the longitude. The load is at the “north pole.”

For the resulting stratiﬁed problem we seek the components of s which do not vanish,
namely sr and sθ in s = sr(r, θ)er +sθ(r, θ)eθ. By symmetry the “toroidal” component of the
strain, sϕ, vanishes everywhere. Also we seek the potential φ = φ(r, θ). The functions sr, sθ, φ
are expanded in spherical harmonics with radially-dependent coeﬃcients; see equation (28)
in (Farrell 1972). The radially-dependent coeﬃcients, for each degree in the expansion, solve
a system of ODEs in the radial coordinate r. Using a radially-dependent density for the
earth these can be solved numerically by standard ODE means. Note that (Farrell 1972) and
(Lingle & Clark 1985) choose the “Gutenberg-Bullen A” model. For the Green’s function
corresponding to a point load, Farrell has done this using a Runge-Kutta method, and we
accept and use the tabulated result.

Following (Lingle & Clark 1985) we are only interested in the vertical displacement of the
surface of the earth, and therefore the vertical displacement u(θ) corresponding to a point
load is the Green’s function we seek.
In terms of the spherical harmonics expansion the
relevant equation is equation (37) in (Farrell 1972). Farrell computes this Green’s function
and reports its values at particular distances in his table A3. Table 1 in (Lingle & Clark 1985)
also reports this data. One must be clear on normalization so a plot is in order here. Let
GE(r) be the vertical displacement caused by a 1 kg mass at the north pole and evaluated at
a distance r along the surface of the earth. (The coordinate r here has a diﬀerent meaning
from the spherical coordinate of the same name. Speciﬁcally, the new variable r = aθ if a
is the radius of the earth and θ is the spherical coordinate, the radian colatitude.) Figure 1

Green’s function for the ﬂat, viscous model which follows.

Here r is the distance along the surface of the earth from the point of applica-
tion of the load. Left: the smooth normalized form rGE(r). Right: the same
data without normalization, suggesting the actual 1/r singularity. Note log
scale on the horizontal axes.

This elastic Green’s function is used as described in equation (20) in (Lingle & Clark 1985)
and as follows. Suppose we seek the vertical displacement uE = uE(x, y, t), caused by elastic
deformation of the spherical earth. Suppose the load at time t is given by the function
Ψ(x, y, t), with units of mass per unit area. Then

In using (1) we necessarily project the earth’s geoid into a ﬁxed plane. This projection
means our results are limited to an appropriately small region of the earth’s surface. We do
integral (1) numerically as explained in section 2.

A viscous, ﬂat earth overlain by an elastic plate. Next we describe the time-dependent
Green’s function for a model which comes from (Cathles 1975). The PDE actually solved by
this Green’s function is given in section 3.

Cathles’ sub-subsection III.A.2.e, pp. 50–55, describes a viscous half-space asthenosphere
overlain by an elastic plate lithosphere. An important point about this model, which partly
explains the superposition “uE + uV ” used by (Lingle & Clark 1985), is that the elastic plate
lithosphere used here deﬂects but does not compress in the vertical. Therefore all vertical
motion in this model is really asthenosphere motion, though the elastic plate spreads the
inﬂuence of any load. The just-described spherical elastic earth exhibits elastic compression,
however.

4

BUELER AND OTHERS

Unfortunately, all we are given in (Cathles 1975) are the Hankel transforms of the actual
equations. Roughly speaking, from (Cathles 1975) we use equation (III-35) along with the
deﬁnitions of “α” and “D” contained in the footnote on page 52 (Lingle 2005, personal
communication). Precisely speaking, however, our source is (Lingle & Clark 1985), from
which we use equations (4), (7), and (8)–(14). We will also use the particular choices of layer
thickness, viscosity, and ﬂexural rigidity for the “two-layer” model from that source. We now
repeat some equations from (Lingle & Clark 1985) as needed for clarity.

Let uV (r, t) be the vertical displacement of the surface supposing a point load at the origin

r = 0 applied at time t = 0 and held. Consider the Hankel transform of this function
∞

¯uV (κ, t) =

uV (r, t)J0(κr)r dr,

Z

where J0 is the Bessel function of zero order (see Appendix A). The Hankel transform is
self-inverse, so uV can be recovered from ¯uV by the same integral.

The half-space model hypothesizes (Lingle & Clark 1985) that ¯uV solves the equation

We denote by ¯σzz the Hankel transform of the normal stress from a point load applied at the
origin

in units of N m−2, corresponding to a point mass of 1 kg. Here H(t) is the Heaviside function
(H(t) = 1 for t
0 and H(t) = 0 otherwise). Note ¯σzz(κ, t) is the Hankel transform of
σzz(r, t) =
gδ0(r)H(t) where δ0(r) is the Dirac delta function at the origin which acts on
functions on the plane.1 The initial condition to (2) is the condition of zero displacement

−

≥

¯uV (κ, 0) = 0.

That is, ¯uV (κ, t) is the Hankel transform of the Heaviside Green’s function of an as yet
unstated PDE of which (2) is the Hankel-transformed version; see section 3 for clariﬁcation
of this description.

Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus for the elastic plate lithosphere are assumed to be
1010 M/m2, respectively. The lithosphere thickness T is assumed to
ν = 0.5 and E = 6.6
1024 N m. The density and viscosity of
be 88 km. The resulting ﬂexural rigidity is D = 5.0
the ﬂuid in the underlying half-space are assumed to be ρr = 3300 kg/m3 and η = 1021 Pa s,
respectively.

Equation (2) is an uncoupled set of linear ﬁrst order ODEs in time. That is, the spatial
Hankel transform has done its job and turned a PDE into a solvable system. Let2 β(κ) =

Note GV has units m kg−1; see formula (6) below.

(cid:17)

As far as we know the integral (5) must be computed numerically. Furthermore there
seems to be no one-dimensional procedure analogous to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
(Bracewell 1978) to do the job quickly. Our strategy for the similar disc load integral (Ap-
pendix B) is to break up the oscillatory integral into more than 100 subintervals and call
an adaptive quadrature routine for each subinterval. This strategy is essentially the same as
that described on page 1104 of (Lingle & Clark 1985) for (5).

Unlike the elastic case, the Green’s function GV is time-dependent. A graph of GV for
several t values is shown in ﬁgure 2. The viscous behavior is clear, as is the role of the
elastic plate lithosphere in removing any singularity at r = 0. Note that the peripheral bulge
develops only at large times; compare the “standard” model in section 4.

105 years. Not log scale on the horizontal axis.

A method for using GV to compute the response to arbitrary load is described in equations
(19) and (22) in (Lingle & Clark 1985), and as follows. Suppose there is a load function
Ψ(x, y, t), with units of mass per unit area, on some region R of our map-plane. The time rate
of change of this load function, or, equivalently, the incremental changes in this load function,
are what we sum using GV to ﬁnd the general (viscous) displacement uV = uV (x, y, t) of the
surface. In fact, let

(x, y, t).

imation of the rate of change of the load. Some such approximation is essential in practice,
of course. They suppose a ﬁxed sequence of past times

assumed constant within element (j, k). (As it stands, this description applies only to the

long elements into which the ﬂowline—a single ice stream and included ocean—was divided.
For Antarctica simulations with ∆x on the order of 50 km or so, the minimum reasonable
number of elements is Nx = Ny at least 80 so M
6400. Note that Nt is roughly independent
of the nature of the problem, as long as it involves large amounts of polar ice. Thus by (14)
an Antarctica problem is roughly a factor of

times more expensive in computation than the problem addressed in (Lingle & Clark 1985) if
one directly implements the load response matrix method using matrix multiplication. Such
poor scaling of this numerical method clearly represents a danger when using it in an ice
sheet simulation.

A major speedup is possible if one uses the convolution sum form of the multiplication,
as in equation (10) when I E is used. (An obvious corresponding construction of a function
I V (p, q, t) is needed to make the viscous LRM computations above into convolutions. As it
turns out, we will not need that construction.) Convolutions sums can be quickly computed
by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Using standard estimates on the time for the FFT
(Briggs & Henson 1995), we can reduce the time to

(1 + Nt)

M log M = O(NtNxNy log Nx log Ny).

(15)

·

Compare this with (14) above. One must still, however, precompute the LRMs, which turns
out to be more expensive than solving the whole problem (over quite long time scales) if one
uses the method of the next section. In addition, the method of the next section eliminates
a factor of Nt work in a time-dependent simulation. The method of the next section also
signiﬁcantly reduces memory usage.

3. The straight-from-the-PDE method

Derivation. We now reverse engineer some of the Green’s function and Hankel transform
“thinking” in the previous sections. We recover the PDE underlying the half-space viscous
model (2). Actually, the resulting equation is not, technically, a partial diﬀerential equation.
It is a linear pseudo-diﬀerential equation easily understood through the Fourier transform.
We have already computed solutions of this PDE by the Hankel transform, by the indirect
method of Green’s functions. In any case, analyzing the new PDE will lead to a much more
eﬃcient method for computing deformation in the half-space model. We must still use, for
now, the Green’s function and LRM for the elastic response computed from the Farrell (1972)
spherical earth model; we will implement the convolution sum (10) by the FFT.

Returning to equation (2), we apply the inverse Hankel transform. In fact (2) is equivalent

to

∂
∂t

(2ηκ¯u) + ρrg¯u + Dκ4 ¯u = ¯σzz,

From now on we remove the assumption of radial load, and suppose equation (17) applies
for any load σzz(x, y, t). The solution u(x, y, t) is a function of three variables; it is no longer

The interesting part of (17) is the time-derivative term. This term accounts for viscous
ﬂow within the mantle. It is not completely clear to the author at the present time why the
1/2 appears or why it represents the correct diﬀusive behavior. The units

The Fourier transform of (17) is worth noting, because, as in the special case of a radial
load wherein we may use the Hankel transform, we can write the solution as an integral.

Implementation. We now treat PDE (17) numerically by discretizing using a ﬁnite diﬀer-
2 using the FFT. Our

We discretize in time by the trapezoid rule—analogous to the Crank-Nicolson method

method for equation (17). In particular, let tn = n∆t for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . and let U n(x, y)

With careful attention to the boundary condition at inﬁnity, our PDE in its time-discretized
form, namely equation (21), can be well-approximated by its discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) version.3 A very reasonable way to incorporate the DFT is to assume periodicity
in the spatial variables.4 For convenience we will also assume a square region. In fact, we

We call the iteration (i), (ii), (iii) the “PDE method” in contrast to the load response
matrix method (“LRM method”) of the previous section. With standard estimates on the
speed of the FFT when Nx, Ny are powers of two (Briggs & Henson 1995), the “PDE method”
requires

O(NxNy(log2 Nx)(log2 Ny))

scalar operations to update the vertical displacement. This compares directly to equations
(14) and (15) for the “LRM method.” In particular, relative to the O(NtNxNy(log2 Nx)(log2 Ny))
estimate (15) for the “LRM method” using the FFT for convolution we note a factor of Nt
less work. Furthermore, the “PDE method” avoids the entire stage of computing the LRM
integrals, which turn out to be quite expensive, though totally uninteresting, computations.
Relative to the “LRM method” without the FFT, using representative values of Nt = 25
and Nx = Ny = 80, and assuming that the constants in the “big O notation” are about the
same, we get a speed up of about

Nx = Ny = 32. We used ∆t = 500 years and bed deformations were computed for 50k years

namely the viscosity expression “∂/∂t

Within the ice sheet modeling community there is a simpliﬁed existing standard model for
a ﬂat “elastic plate (lithosphere) that overlies a viscous asthenosphere” (Greve 2001, Hagdorn
2003, Zweck & Huybrechts 2005). Comparison to this model illuminates the signiﬁcance of
the viscosity expression in (17). The standard model consists of two equations

where us(x, y, t) is the vertical displacement of the earth’s surface, u0(x, y) is a hypothesized
unloaded displacement state, and w(x, y, t) is the position of a notional elastic plate which
is in equilibrium with the current load σzz(x, y, t). The essential viscous constant for the
standard model is a characteristic time scale τ of relaxation, chosen, for example, as 3000
years by Greve (2001) and Zweck & Huybrechts (2005). The relaxation time τ is indirectly
related to the asthenosphere viscosity η; more on this below.

We can now calculate an illuminating comparison by hand. Suppose that at time t = 0 all
load is removed but that the vertical displacement is a y-independent sinusoidal mode with
spatial frequency k:

u(x, y, t = 0) = us(x, y, t = 0) = A0 exp(ikπx/L).

(30)

Here A0 is the initial amplitude and L is a characteristic length scale. We ask: how does
such a mode decay in the two models?

14

BUELER AND OTHERS

Note that the qth power of the Laplacian act on this mode as follows:

q exp(ikπx/L) = (k2π2/L2)q exp(ikπx/L).

Thus model (17) has solution u(x, y, t) = A(t) exp(ikπx/L) where

A(t = 0) = A0

because w = 0 as the load has been removed; equation (29) reduces to ∂us/∂t =
Here we see that all modes decay at a rate independent of the frequency.

−

But it is clearly the case that a viscous asthenosphere will make elastic plate modes decay
at diﬀerent rates depending on the frequency. Indeed, Greve (1997) identiﬁes the failure of
the standard model (28), (29) to have frequency dependent relaxation times as a deﬁciency
of that model relative to full spherical self-gravitating models. Comparing equation (31) to
(32) we are motivated to plot the function

which has units of time. Supposing L = 2000 km and that ρr, g, D, η have the values given
in section 1, we plot τ (k) in ﬁgure 4. We see that the standard choice τ = 3000 a in (32)
corresponds to frequencies k
10 in (31), but that no constant relaxation time is
representative of the actual relaxation spectrum.

≈

Furthermore we see in formula (33) and ﬁgure 4 that for small k (e.g. k . 3) the relaxation
time τ (k) is proportional to k. This behavior is identiﬁed by (Klemann & Wolf 1999)—
see Greve (2001, section 5)—as correct for the most signiﬁcant mode in a spherical, self-
gravitating viscoelastic earth model.

The justiﬁcation for model (28), (29) is its computability, of course.

Indeed, the com-
putation of the elliptic PDE (28) is standard in all numerical paradigms (ﬁnite diﬀerence,
ﬁnite element, spectral). At least on a rectangular spatial grid, however, the time-semi-
discretization (21) of equation (17) is just as computable as (28).
In particular, if an ice
sheet simulation is performed on a rectangular grid using a ﬁnite diﬀerence or ﬁnite ele-
ment method for the ice dynamics then equation (17) can be easily computed by the Fourier
spectral collocation method of the previous section.

Now we come to another reason to prefer equation (17) as a model for earth deformation
in the context of ice sheet modeling. Let us suppose that at the current time the ice thickness
H0 (and possibly water depth, giving an eﬀective ice thickness) in a region of interest has
been well-measured. Let us suppose that a reasonably detailed map of current uplift rate
˙u0 = ∂u/∂t is also known. This is a realistic supposition given given the state of observational
geophysics circa 2006 because uplift can be well-constrained by GPS measurements (Larsen
and others 2005) when bedrock is exposed. Alternatively a spherical viscoelastic earth model

of more-or-less arbitrary sophistication and computational expense might generate a trusted
current uplift map (Ivins & James 2005). In either case we can then use (17) to determine the
initial condition for the earth deformation part of an ice sheet simulation without requiring
further reference to an assumed past load history; compare the integration over load history
scheme used in (Lingle & Clark 1985). In fact, by (17) we may solve

2η

(34)

for u0 to get the starting displacement. In other words we ask for the “pre-bent” position of
the elastic plate in the half space model which accounts for the current uplift rate using the
current load (i.e. current eﬀective ice thickness). Solving (34) numerically is no harder than,
in fact it amounts to, one step of the numerical method already described. If the load does
not change in the simulation, an uninteresting case for ice sheets of course, then the elastic
plate overlying the viscous half space will start at the current time with the current uplift
but will then relax to the state satisfying equation (18) for equilibrium with the load and
bouyant force, and there will no more uplift. Note that the presence of bed topography is
completely irrelevant here because of the linear nature of the model; see comments in (Lingle
& Clark 1985) to the eﬀect that bed topography represents a irregular “thin veneer of zero
strength” atop an elastic plate lithosphere of (signiﬁcant) ﬂexural rigidity D.

The mechanism described in the previous paragraph is, we believe, a more principled
replacement for the hypothesized “unloaded surface elevation” u0(x, y) used in the standard
model (28), (29). Use of that standard model seems to require an assumption of present
day isostatic equilibrium with the current load (Zweck & Huybrechts 2005) or other artiﬁcial
assumption which is in conﬂict with observed spatially-varying current uplift.

An entirely diﬀerent class of viscoelastic earth models exists in the literature, of course.
These are the layered, spherical, self-graviating viscoelastic models which typically descend

16

BUELER AND OTHERS

from the work of Cathles (1975) and/or Peltier (1974). The numerical implementation of
these models typically involves computing a high degree spherical harmonic expansion of the
strain ﬁeld for the entire three-dimensional geoid. The traditional diﬃculty with these models
is their computational cost (Fastook 1999, Greve 2001). Furthermore there is only modest
beneﬁt because results from the standard model (28), (29) above, in particular, are regarded
by the ice sheet modeling community as reasonably close to those from the spherical models
(Greve 2001). Equation (17) is promising because it is just as computationally inexpensive as
the standard model but incorporates at least one important feature of the spherical models,
namely frequency dependent relaxation times.

Speaking mathematically, an interesting additional possibility exists within the same class
of computationally inexpensive “PDE methods.” Namely, one should be able to modify
equation (17) to take spherical eﬀects into account. In particular, equation (17) would be
computable at essentially the same speed if it were replaced by a non-constant coeﬃcient
version, for instance

We do not currently know that a set of non-constant coeﬃcients η, D, α, β exist which cor-
rectly account for spherical geometry. It seems, however, that classical continuum mechanics
and diﬀerential geometry must produce such a form because the standard model for a spheri-
cal self-gravitating earth is a linear model. That is, it has linear response to load. Abstractly,
this linearity is all that is necessary to make it inevitable5 that a two (spatial) dimension, non-
constant coeﬃcient linear equation for the vertical displacement of the earth’s surface must
exist for each patch of the earth’s surface. It may well involve additional pseudo-diﬀerential
operators not present in the putative form (35), however.

5. Numerical results

A “tweak” to the procedure. It turns out that a small error can be avoided if the “PDE
method” is modiﬁed slightly. In fact, in verifying the “PDE method” below, using an exact
integral formula for a disc load, we observed that there was a uniform a error of several
meters. This uniform error decayed slowly as the distance at which the periodic boundary
condition was applied went to inﬁnity.

The following simple modiﬁcation eliminates this error. Using the notation of section 3,
consider U n(xj, yk) on the grid at timestep n. Let ¯U n

from formula (44) in Appendix B. Choose the values H0, R0 so that the volume πR2

COMPUTATION OF A VISCOELASTIC DEFORMABLE EARTH MODEL

17

That is, we want the “far-ﬁeld value” produced by the original “PDE method” to be thrown
out and replaced by the equilibrium plate value with an equivalent disc load. Though the
volume of the equivalent disc is determined by the current load, one obviously has some free-
dom in choosing its thickness and radius. We presume that an eﬀort is made to approximate
the aspect ratio of the actual load, but close matching is not essential. In fact the Green’s
function value would work reasonably well, too.

Veriﬁcation. The ﬁrst concern regarding computations with our earth deformation model
is veriﬁcation. In particular, we want to know if numerical results from the “PDE method”,
with the just-mentioned “tweak,” are close to highly-accurate solutions of the continuum
equation (17).
In seeking such solutions we inevitably come to disc loads. Appendix B
addresses this case by the Hankel transform. It yields equation (43), an integral formula for
the time-dependent radially-symmetric deﬂection uV (r, t) resulting from the application (at
time zero) of a disc load; see ﬁgure 16. The integral must be computed numerically, but
numerical quadrature is an approximation completely independent of the cartesian-grid- and
FFT-based “PDE method.” We use integral formula (43) as an “exact” solution, believing
the accuracy of our numerical integration of (43) to exceed that of the “PDE method” for
any achievable grid.

Our Matlab implementation of the “PDE method” is the function fastearth.m listed
in Appendix D. Also listed are implementations of the LRM method for the spherical elastic
earth model (geforconv.m) and the numerical integration of equation (43) (viscdisc.m).

×

Let us deﬁne a particular numerical experiment. Suppose we use the parameters speciﬁed
1024 N m, ρr = 3300 kg m−3, and η = 1021 Pa s. Suppose the disc of ice
in section 1: D = 5.0
(density ρi = 910 kg m−3) has radius 1000 km and thickness 1000 m. We seek the deﬂection
on a square region R, centered on the disc load, of side length 4000 km (Lx = Ly = 2000
km). Suppose that at time zero the deﬂection is identically zero, and suppose that the load
is applied at that time. We calculate the deﬂection at t = 20k years as computed by the
“PDE method” and by formula (43).

There are three numerical parameters of importance for the “PDE method”:

•
•

•

N , the number of grid points in each direction,
Z, the factor by which the computational domain Ω = [
than the physical domain [
∆t, the time step used in approximating the time derivative which occurs in equation
(17).

realistic ice loads do not have margins as sharp as this disc load. For these reasons among
others it is reasonable to consider average errors, and we see in ﬁgure 7 that the average
errors are less than 20 cm for N = 256, or roughly 0.07% of the compensation depth.

Next we compare the eﬀects of spatial grid reﬁnement, increasing N , to reduction of time
stepsize ∆t on the error. See ﬁgure 8. We see that any value of ∆t less than 500 years is
ﬁne; this is great news for ice sheet simulation. It is not, however, surprising because of the
relative timescales of ice versus asthenosphere ﬂow.

BUELER AND OTHERS

Ice sheet modeling. Earth deformation used in the context of ice sheet modeling is our
actual interest. Earth deformation is obviously eﬀected by ice sheet ﬂow—the load moves
around. Conversely, as the bed deforms the surface slope of the ice sheet changes and this
eﬀects ﬂow. There is non-trivial coupling.

The reasonable simplest ice sheet model is the isothermal model with Glen rheology
(Paterson 1994, Nye 2000). Let h(x, y, t) be the surface elevation of the ice and let H(x, y, t)
be the ice thickness. The frozen-base isothermal ice sheet equation is the single nonlinear
diﬀusive partial diﬀerential equation

where n is the Glen exponent, e.g. n = 3, and Γ is a constant (typically Γ = 2(ρig)nA0/(n+2)
where A0 is a softness parameter). If b(x, y, t) is the ice sheet bed elevation—a slight change
of notation from the rest of the paper—then of course h = b + H.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

As we now show, exact similarity solutions to this equation which incorporate simple
isostasy (Nye 2000, Bueler et al. 2005; compare Halfar 1983) provide a very nice tool to
examine coupling to the earth model. They help illuminate the diﬀerences among earth
models. By “simple isostasy” we mean the rule which speciﬁes

equations (37) and (38),
equations (37), (28), (29), and b = us,
equations (37), (1), (17), and b = uE + uV .

Figure 9 shows a result of a coupled simulation for these three models. A detail near the
margin is shown in ﬁgure 10.

In fact, the result shown in ﬁgure 9 came from starting with H = 0 and b = 0 at t = 0 and
using an accumulation history corresponding to the simlarity solution illustrated by ﬁgure 11.
That is, the accumulation M (x, y, t) comes from equations (9) and (10) in (Bueler et al. 2005),
10−13
using f = 910/3300, λ = 5, α =
m−3 s−1, and with the additional statement M = 5t−1Hλ. Note t0 = 40034 years.
In
addition, at time t = t0 the accumulation is turned oﬀ and so for t > t0 the exact behavior
of the solution to Simple is a Halfar-type (Halfar 1983) accumulation-free solution. Thus
the accumulation history is from a similarity solution to equation (37), incorporating simple
isostasy, which grows from zero at t = 0 to maximum height at t0 = 40034 years and spreads
out from then on, with no loss of volume.

The importance of such a similarity solution is that it forms an exact continuum solution
to the Simple model. Therefore we can answer with some precision the question “how
do diﬀerences resulting from coupling to various earth deformation models compare to the
numerical errors which occur in ice sheet modeling? ” This is an important question.
If
numerical ice sheet errors demonstrably exceed the earth model diﬀerences then we should
be skeptical of any expenditure of eﬀort in the earth modeling direction. Conversely, even

Figure 11. Views of a similarity solution to equation (37). Left: volume
over time. Right: margin radius (solid) and dome height (dashed) over time.
At time t0 = 40034 a the solution switches from growing (λ = 5) to Halfar
(λ = 0), in both cases with simple isostasy (f = 910/3300).

Figure 9 indeed suggests diﬀerences among the coupled models. We ran each model to ﬁnal
time t = 60k a. As shown in ﬁgure 12, however, all of the models produce the same volume
at the ﬁnal time, and indeed at all times; this follows from using the same ﬁnite diﬀerence
approach for the ice ﬂow (as described in (Bueler et al. 2005)) and, of course, the same
accumulation history M (x, y, t). So the diﬀerences can be described by the distributions of ice
thickness. In ﬁgure 13 we show the maximum and average of the pairwise absolute thickness
diﬀerences
(The average diﬀerences are over the H > 0 grid
points under Simple.) We see average thickness diﬀerences greater than 10 m between each
pair. We see that the greatest pairwise diﬀerence is between Simple and Lingle&Clark;
compare ﬁgure 9.

We see a similar picture for bed elevation diﬀerences, with Simple versus Standard
showing somewhat smaller diﬀerences, and the comparison Simple versus Lingle&Clark
again being largest.

Now, are these diﬀerences signiﬁcant? The answer shown in ﬁgure 15 is yes. With a
caveat. As noted in (Bueler et al. 2005), ice sheet ﬂow simulations on grids inevitably make
large thinkness errors near the margin. These errors decay only slowly under grid reﬁnement,
as can be seen in ﬁgure 15.

In brief, one derives equation (17) by starting with equation (4) in (Lingle & Clark 1985),

Of course, equation (17) fails to incorporate spherical or self-gravitating eﬀects. Following
Lingle & Clark (1985) we have, however, chosen to superpose upon the result of (17) a
purely-elastic, but spherical and self-gravitating (Farrell 1972), displacement from equation
(1). This is an admittedly ad hoc way to incorporate spherical and self-gravitating eﬀects
into an earth deformation model.6 We note that the eﬀects of equation (1) are “longer
range” than those of equation (17) at large times, so in some sense it is more important to
incorporate “sphericalness” into the purely elastic part of the earth model.

Finally we consider the Hankel transform of the Dirac delta “function.” Care must be

Appendix B. The disc load case

(42)

As an exercise and for veriﬁcation purposes we describe a solution to the viscous half-space
ﬂat earth equation (2). The inverse Hankel transform of this solution is a solution to equation
(17).

Consider a disc load centered at the map-plane origin, of radius R0 and thickness H0. In

this case

ρigH0, 0 < r < R0,

σzz(r) =

−
0,

(

R0 < r

where ρi is the density of the load; we might as well suppose it is ice. Actually, let’s suppose
this load is applied at time zero and is held in place: σzz(r, t) = σzz(r)H(t). Because this
load is radial, the Hankel-transformed equation (2) is useful. We will assume an undeformed
state ¯uV = 0 at time t = 0.

We need the Hankel transform ¯σzz:

This integral can be computed numerically, but care must be taken because the integrand

is quite oscillatory. We break up the integrand into many (
lab’s quadl on each subinterval. The code viscdisc in Appendix D implements equation
(43). In particular, we believe that computing (43) for geophysically reasonable parameter
values is quite accurate, and that the result can be used to verify the result from the Fourier
spectral collocation method described in section 3. See section 5 for results. The displace-
ment for a particular disc load is graphed in ﬁgure 16. This solution looks rather like the
Green’s function GV plotted in ﬁgure 2, as expected, but with a wider depressed area.

Here we make some comments on formula (6) in section 1 which relate it to results in

of the displacement uV (x, y, t0) at any particular past time t0. That is, (6) computes the
displacement at time t caused by a load history known so far into the past that prior displace-
ment states are irrelevant. This is reasonable because the underlying PDE, equation (17) in
section 3, is diﬀusive and thus the inﬂuence of any displacement state decays exponentially
in time.

If, on the other hand, an initial displacement u(x, y, t0) is known at a relatively recent past
time then we must adjust (6). As a start, integrating (6) by-parts in the time variable and
assuming Ψ(x, y,

Appendix D. Matlab codes

This section gives Matlab implementations of the numerical strategies outlined in sections

2, 3, and Appendix B. Here is a synopsis of the three codes:

•

geforconv precomputes the spherical elastic load response matrix I E, given by equa-
tion (9), which is the computational form of the Green’s function GE. It numeri-
cally computes integrals (9) by using Matlab’s dblquad with the default settings,
where the integrand comes from linearly interpolating the tabular data given by
If geforconv has been run on the given grid, fastearth (below)
(Farrell 1972).
then convolves I E with the load, as noted, using Matlab’s conv2 for now because it
seems suﬃciently fast; an FFT-based alternative is reasonable. The precomputation
is much more expensive than running the viscous deformation model or convolving
I E with the load. For instance, in the Matlab run

tic, I = geforconv(256,256,2000,2000); toc
save I256 I
tic, fastearth(256,100000,500,4,’testC’); toc

•

the call to geforconv requires about 4 hours while only 10 minutes is required to
run fastearth; the machine is a 3 GHz Pentium IV.
fastearth computes the viscous model using fft2 to compute equation (26). It also
convolves I E with the load for the spherical elastic model as noted. In this example
implementation the load is either a standard disc load or a modiﬁcation to Test C
from (Bueler et al. 2005).
viscdisc implements formula (43) in Appendix B.

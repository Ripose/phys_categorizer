Often in nature the temporal distribution of inhomogeneous stochastic point processes can be
modeled as a realization of renewal Poisson processes with a variable rate. Here we investigate one
of the classical examples, namely the temporal distribution of polarity reversals of the geomagnetic
ﬁeld.
In spite of the commonly used underlying hypothesis, we show that this process strongly
departs from a Poisson statistics, the origin of this failure stemming from the presence of temporal
clustering. We ﬁnd that a L´evy statistics is able to reproduce paleomagnetic data, thus suggesting
the presence of long-range correlations in the underlying dynamo process.

Local paleomagnetic measurements of the geomagnetic
ﬁeld [1, 2, 3] reveal a sequence of sudden and occasional
global polarity reversals in the last 160 million years. The
magnetic dipole typically reverses its direction in a few
103 years, while the time intervals between successive re-
versals range from 104 up to 107 years [1, 3, 4]. Even
though polarity reversals can be ascribed to the Earth’s
magnetic dynamo [1, 5, 6, 7], details of the mechanism
remain poorly understood. The debate on the origin of
reversals, the modeling of the trigger (external or inter-
nal to Earth) and the generation of longer variations in
the average reversal rate is still open (cfr. e.g. Ref.s
[2, 8]). A look at the sequence of reversals, for exam-
ple the most used CK95 database [3], reproduced in ﬁg.
1, shows that polarity reversals seem to be the result of
a non-periodic chaotic (or stochastic) process. Actually
non regular reversals can be observed in the framework of
purely deterministic toy models that mimic the dynamics
of the dynamo eﬀect with only few modes [9, 10, 11], in
the framework of noise-induced switchings between two
metastable states [12, 13, 14] or in mean-ﬁeld dynamo
with a noise-perturbed α proﬁle [7, 15].
In principle
geodynamo is described by 3D global Magnetohydrody-
namics (MHD) that self-consistently solve for the ﬂuid
ﬂow, thermodynamics and magnetic ﬁelds with all non-
linear feedbacks (for a review see Ref. [5] and references
therein, and the results of the recent 15.2 TFlops simu-
lation of geodynamo on the Earth Simulator [16]). Al-
though some numerical codes have simulated short series
of spontaneous reversals, none have been run so far at
high enough resolution to be conﬁdent that the critical
dynamics is being captured in the simulation.

In spite of the paucity of data sets, it is commonly as-
sumed that the phenomenon of reversals stems from an
underlying Poisson process. This conjecture is based on
the fact that the polarity persistence times ∆t, deﬁned
as the time intervals between two consecutive reversals

We used the CK95 dataset.

e.g Ref.

∆t = ti+1 − ti, seem to be exponentially distributed
[1, 13, 17, 18], namely P (∆t) ∼ λ exp(−λ∆t) where λ
represents the rate of occurrence of reversals. Diﬀerent
analyses (cfr.
[19]) state that the frequency
distribution of intervals between Cenozoic geomagnetic
reversals approximate a power law for large ∆t. Even a
rough look at the probability distribution function P (∆t)
(cfr. ﬁg 1) shows that the situation is not clear, mainly
in presence of a poor data set with high statistical errors.

Recently Constable [18] raised two main statistical
features to the attention of the scientiﬁc community,
i) the distribution of events shows a paucity
namely:
of short intervals;
ii) the rate of occurrence of events
is time-dependent λ = λ(t). The author investigated
the temporal distribution of λ(t), showing that a Pois-
son model with a monotonic rate, either increasing or
decreasing, is not a good model for the reversal process.
On the contrary, reversals could be perhaps modeled as
a renewal Poisson process with a rate that must change
sign at some interval before 158 My [18]. In any case,
modeling λ(t) over the entire time interval is not an easy
task (cfr. also Ref.s [17, 21]). Moreover, in this situa-
tion, namely when the rate λ depends on time, the dis-
tribution of persistence times remains without physical
meaning and cannot be used to determine the Poisson
character of events [20].

The problem is perhaps more general than what we
present here, because abrupt ﬂow reversals have been
found also in the large-scale circulation during turbulent
Rayleigh-Benard convection [22], or in the wind direc-
tion in atmosphere [23]. The conjecture that reversals
are Poisson events is made in all cases. Here, starting
from the above experimental evidences, and using a sim-
ple statistical test on some databases, we will investigate
whether a conjecture based on the occurrence of a Pois-
son process for reversals is correct or not. We will show
that this is not the case, and that geomagnetic rever-
sals are clustered in time, a result which stems from the
presence of memory in the process generating polarity
reversals.

Under the experimental evidence that the rate of re-
versals is not constant, we can test, as a zero-th order
hypothesis, wheter an approach based on the occurrence

2

of a Local Poisson Process is correct or not.
In other
word, according to Constable [18] it can be conjectured
that (hypothesis H0), even if it cannot be decide wheter
globally the reversals stem from a Poisson process, an un-
derlying time-varying Poisson process could be assumed
to originate the geomagnetic reversals. Since the rever-
sals rate λ(t) is not known, we have to build up a test
which is independent on the rate λ. This can be done
through a measure used previously in the framework of
solar ﬂares [24, 25]. We introduce a statistical quan-
tity that is nothing but the suitably normalized local
time interval between reversals. Let us consider the time
sequence of reversals as a point-like process and sup-
pose that each reversal occurs at the discrete time ti.
Let δti = min{ti+1 − ti; ti − ti−1} and let τi be either
τi = ti−1 − ti−2 (if δti = ti − ti−1) or τi = ti+2 − ti+1
(if δti = ti+1 − ti), so that δti and τi are the two per-
sistence times following or preceeding a given reversal at
ti. If the local Poisson hypothesis H0 holds, both δti and
τi are independently distributed according to an expo-
nential probability density: p(δt) = 2λi exp(−2λiδt) and
p(τ ) = λi exp(−λiτ ) with local rate λi. Then, under the
hypothesis H0, the stochastic variable H, deﬁned as

H(δti, τi) =

2δti
2δti + τi

(1)

is uniformly distributed in [0; 1] and has cumulative dis-
tribution P (H ≥ h) = 1 − h, independent on λi [25].
In a process where τis are systematically smaller than
2δtis, clusters are present and the average value of H is
greater than 1/2. On the contrary when the underlying
process is characterized by voids, the average value of H
is less than 1/2. From time series, it is easy to calculate
the probability P (H ≥ h) and the probability density
function f (H).

We apply the above test to four diﬀerent sequences
of geomagnetic polarity reversals, namely to the already
mentioned CK95, to H68, HA97 and KG86 [26]. We cal-
culate the probability density function f (H) reported in
ﬁgure 2 (left panel). As can be seen, a signiﬁcant de-
viation from the uniform distribution is evident in all
datasets, the departure of polarity reversals from local
Poisson statistics stemming from the presence of clusters.
Then a clear deviation of the observed cumulative proba-
bility P (H ≥ h) from a linear law (cfr. ﬁg. 2 right panel),
expected under H0, is obtained. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) test applied to the cumulative distributions con-
ﬁrms that the assumed hypothesis H0 is not reliable and
must be rejected (the signiﬁcance level of the KS test
being smaller than 0.5% for all datasets).

To further characterize the origin of the departure of
polarity reversals from a local Poisson process, we try to
describe the statistics of persistence times with a L´evy
process. The L´evy functions are stable, and can be ob-
tained from the Central Limit Theorem by relaxing the
hypothesis of ﬁnite variance [28]. To avoid problems
arising from the inﬁnite variance, which is unlikely in

real physical processes, a Truncated L´evy Flight distri-
bution (TLF) has been proposed [29] introducing a cutoﬀ
in the standard L´evy. The process can be generated by a
random variable x according to the distribution function
f (x) ∼ e−θ|x| | x |−1−ν, where θ represents the cutoﬀ rate
and ν is the characteristic exponent. It can be shown [30]
that the limit distribution P (z) of the sum z of random
variables x can be computed, for ν 6= 1, by the following

where C is a normalization factor and Γ(ν) is the usual
gamma function. For ν ≥ 2 we recover a normal random
process, the result of the integration being a Gaussian
PDF, while smaller values of ν represent increasing de-
viation from Gaussianity. We thus ﬁtted the measured
cumulative PDF of persistences P (∆t ≥ T ), computed as
described above and reported in ﬁgure 3, with equation
(2). The equation has been numerically integrated us-
ing a standard minimum-χ2 procedure. We obtained the
best-ﬁt parameters ν = 1.09 ± 0.1, and θ = 0.15 ± 0.04
with a reduced χ2 ≃ 0.5.

The possibility of reproducing with a L´evy function
the cumulative distribution of persistence times indicates
both that the process underlying the polarity reversals
is statistically self-similar in time, and that a certain
amount of memory, due to long-range correlations, is
present in the process. From a physical point of view
we could expect that the dynamics of the ﬂuid earth core

is aﬀected by its hystory, thus generating correlations
among reversals. This feature has recently be observed
for the solar dynamo [31]. Of course a lot of diﬀerent
random processes can reproduce the departure from a
Poisson statistics. Only the next generation of simula-
tors will be able to produce datasets with enough rever-
sals to allow us toinvestigate in detail the occurrence of
long-range correlations in 3D global MHD simulations of
geodynamo.
In this framework, statistical analysis on
real data, among other, play the key role of discriminat-
ing among diﬀerent random processes that can reproduce
the departure from poisson statistics, thus increasing our
knowledge of the geodynamo process. Dynamical models
can help us because they describe, with only few physi-
cal ingredients, some gross features of the enormous com-
plexity of the geodynamo process. In this perspective it
is useful to compare the statistics of reversals observed
in toy models with statistics obtained on real datasets.

As an example, we investigate the sequence of random
reversals generated by a standard numerical analysis of
the two-disk chaotic geodynamo model [9]. The model,
known as “Rikitake dynamo”, is described by the follow-
ing ordinary diﬀerential equations: dx/dt = −x + yz,
dy/dt = −y + x(z − 15/4), and dz/dt = 1 − xy (in the
following model A). The cumulative distribution of H,
obtained by the times of reversals of the variable x(t), has
been reported in ﬁgure 4. It is evident that the chaotic
dynamics of the model is responsible for the presence of
correlations among the reversals. As a further example
we investigate a dynamical model [14] based on stochas-
tic excitation of the axisymmetric component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld (model B), that reads: dx/dt = (1 − x2)x +
V11x+V12y +V13z, dy/dt = −ay−cz +V21x+V22y +V23z,

and dz/dt = cy − az + V31x + V32y + V33z. The Vij (t)
are 9 independent random functions of time, with zero
mean and equal r.m.s. magnitude, that are renewed af-
ter a time τc. We use the standard parameters a = 2,
V 2
τc, where D = 0.4 [14].
c = 5, τc = 0.01, and D =
ij
The cumulative distribution of H (ﬁg. 4), calculated by
(cid:10)
using the times of the random reversals of the variable
x(t), has been reported in ﬁgure 4. Even in this case a
departure from a Poisson distribution is observed, due to
the correlations introduced through τc.

(cid:11)

Even if the chaotic dynamics within the Rikitake
dynamo roughly reproduces the presence of clustering
among reversals, a look at ﬁg.s 4 reveals that in model A
the departure from the local Poisson distribution seems
to be aﬀected by the presence of sudden jumps in the
cumulative distribution of H. Say the reversal time se-
ries x(t) presents few recurrent persistence times of equal
extent. On the other hand the model B shows a diﬀer-
ent departure from Poisson statistics, that is mainly due
to both very low values and, even if in minor extent, to
very high values of H. The time behaviour of reversals in
the model B is then hardly compatible with the cluster-
ing process evidenced through our analysis. Further toy

models based on completely random external triggers of
reversals (e.g. stochastic resonance) cannot describe the
geodynamo process.

As a conclusion, we investigated the statistics of persis-
tence times between geomagnetic reversals. We applied a
statistical test, showing that geomagnetic reversals stem
from an underlying process that is far from being locally
Poissonian, as currently conjectured [18]. A L´evy func-
tion is able to nicely ﬁt the probability distribution of
persistence times. Although not investigated up to now
in a geophysical framework, our results can be interpreted
as a strong evidence for the presence of correlations be-
tween reversal events. These correlations arise from some
degree of memory in the underlying geodynamo process
[7, 27] that gives rise to clustering of reversals.

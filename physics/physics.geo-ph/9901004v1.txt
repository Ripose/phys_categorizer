4D Tropospheric Tomography using GPS Estimated
Slant Delays

A. Flores∗, G. Ruﬃni and A. Rius

February 2, 2008

Abstract

Tomographic techniques are successfully applied to obtain 4D images of the
tropospheric refractivity in a local dense network. In the lower atmosphere both
the small height and time scales and the non-dispersive nature of tropospheric
delays require a more careful analysis of the data. We show how GPS data is
processed to obtain the tropospheric slant delays using the GIPSY-OASIS II
software and deﬁne the concept of pseudo-wet delays, which will be the observ-
ables in the tomographic software. We then discuss the inverse problem in the
3D stochastic tomography, using simulated refractivity ﬁelds to test the system
and the impact of noise. Finally, we use data from the Kilauea network in Hawaii
and a local 4x4x41-voxel grid on a region of 400 Km2 and 15 Km in height to
produce 4D refractivity ﬁelds. Results are compared with ECMWF forecast.

1.

Introduction

One goal of ongoing research on the application of tomographic techniques to
the atmosphere using GPS signals is to obtain 4D images of the refractivity in the
troposphere using a ground network. In this paper we present our ﬁrst results on
the subject, showing that a careful combination of GPS data processing together
with tomographic Kalman-ﬁltering can reproduce the state of the refractivity in
the neutral atmosphere.

The eﬀect of the atmosphere on GPS signals is measured as an extra delay.
The ionospheric electron content produces a dispersive delay and can hence be
corrected by using two diﬀerent frequencies and linearly combining them. The
neutral atmosphere, however, induces a delay independent of frequency. This
delay (∆L) can be related to the refractivity by

where P is the total atmospheric pressure (mbar), Pw is the water vapor pressure
(mbar), and T is the atmospheric temperature (K) ( [Smith et al.. 1953]). The
extraction of this slant delay from GPS measurements requires accurate mod-
eling. To take into account the dependence of the tropospheric delay on the
satellite elevation, mapping functions are used, and a Zenith Total Delay (ZTD)
is estimated at each station. To consider azimuthal variability, a horizontal gra-
dient is also estimated. The time evolutions of these parameters is modeled as
random walk stochastic processes. The total atmospheric delay can be parti-
tioned into two components: the hydrostatic delay, due to the dry gases in the
troposphere and the nondipole component of water vapor, and the wet delay,
due to the dipole component of water vapor. The contribution of the hydrostatic
component to the ZTD is larger than that of the wet and it can be estimated from
surface pressure measurements. We remove the zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD)
from the total slant delays through an accurate estimation of the pressure ac-
cording to site measurements, and then form the pseudo-wet delays (PWD): we
map the time series zenith wet delay (ZWD) and total horizontal gradients back
to each ray direction and add the residuals to account for any data mismodeling.
The refractivity associated is termed pseudo-wet refractivity ( ˆN ). The PWD’s
are the observables in the tomographic approach. The reason for removing of
the ZHD is two-fold. On the one hand, it reduces the scale height of the problem
(typically, the hydrostatic component has a scale height of 10 Km while the wet
component has a 2 Km scale height) and thus eases the numerical solution. In
addition, the ˆN ﬁeld obtained is closely related to the water vapor distribution.
In the paper we will ﬁrst discuss the approach taken to estimate the PWD’s
using the JPL software GIPSY-OASIS II (GOA II) (see [Webb et al. 1997])
and the network used in the study. Then we brieﬂy discuss the inverse problem
and analyze the impact of the needed constraints through simulations. Finally,
tomographic solutions with GPS data measured in the Kilauea network in Hawaii
during 1st February 1997 and their comparison with independent measurement
sources will be presented.

2. Tropospheric Slant Delay Estimation

The GPS signals L1 and L2 are ﬁrst combined to remove the eﬀect of the
ionosphere. The resulting observable, LC, is modeled in GOA II using a Point
Positioning Strategy in terms of tropospheric eﬀects (ZWD+ZHD+Gradients),
geometrical factors and receiver clocks. Satellite clock corrections and orbits are
provided by JPL, as well as earth orientation parameters. Tropospheric delays
are mapped to the zenith using Niell mapping functions ( [Niell 1996]) and related
to the gradients following the expression ( [Davis et al. 1993]):

DL = mh(e)Dhz + mw(e)Dwz +

+ m∆(e) cot e[GN cos φ + GE sin φ],

(2.1)

The time dependence of the tropospheric component is handled using a kalman
ﬁlter and a random walk stochastic process, with a drift rate of 0.25 cm/√h for
the zenith delay and 0.03 cm/√h ( [Bar-Sever et al. 1998]) for the gradients.
We then form the PWD from the solution as discussed above.

2.1. Network and data considered

GPS data was tracked with a sampling of 30 s in the Kilauea network in Hawaii.
A map with the stations is shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that they cover an
area of about 400 Km2. The heights of the stations are distributed in a range of
about 2000 m, which seems particularly well-suited for vertical resolution in the
tomographic solution.

In tomography, one wants to obtain the solution ﬁelds (refractivity in the tro-
pospheric case) from the integrated value along a ray path. The amount and
distribution of data, however, is often insuﬃcient to determine a unique solu-
tion. Thus, some additional information has to be added to the system. To this
end, we rewrite the pseudo-wet refractivity as ˆN (~r, t) =
J aJ (t)ΨJ (~r) + ǫ(~r, t)
where ΨJ (~r) is any set of basis functions and ~ǫ(~r, t) is the quantization error. In
our tomographic approach, three dimensional voxels are used. Then, our obser-
s.l. ΨJ (~r)d~l + ξ(~r, t).
vations are modeled by yi = Ti =
This is a set of linear equations of the form Ax = y. As mentioned, the sys-
tem may not have a solution and thus, we seek to minimize the functional
χ2(x) = (y
Ax). Even so, the unknowns may not be ﬁxed by
the data, although the number of equations is usually much greater than the
number of unknowns. This is so because we are trying to obtain a solution with
more degrees of freedom (more voxels) than the resolution carried by the data.
In previous work, (see [Ruﬃni et al. 1998] and [Rius et al. 1997 ]) we have
discussed the use of a correlation functional to conﬁne the spatial spectrum of
the solution to the low portion of the frequency space. The same concept can
be expressed by adding new equations (constraints) that impose that the density
in a voxel be a weighted average of its neighbours. Let us now take a closer
look to the constraints. Horizontal smoothing is needed to account for the non-
uniform distribution of the rays. Water vapor is mostly concentrated in the ﬁrst
2 Km in height. Now, if we aim for a tomographic solution with a resolution of
350 m (a trade-oﬀ between data resolution and computer load), some smooth-
ing constraints have to be added in the vertical direction. Finally, we impose
a zero value constraint in the highest layer. The constraints are represented by
x = 0. To smooth out the time variability, a Kalman ﬁltering
the equation B
was used, modeling the troposphere as a random walk stochastic process with a
drift rate of δ = 0.14 cm/(Km √h). The tomographic process is integrated in
our home-made software package LOTTOS (LOcal Tropospheric TOmography
Software).

3.2. Results with simulated data

In order to test the software for the network’s geometry and tune the diﬀerent
parameters, simulations play an essential role. We have simulated a 3D pseudo-

wet refractivity ﬁeld following the expression (following [Davis et al. 1993])

0 = 150 mm/Km and N D

where hw = 2 Km, hd = 10 Km, ~gd and ~gw are the horizontal gradients up to a
multiplicative constant in the hydrostatic and wet component, respectively and
~ρ is the horizontal coordinate. We have set N W
0r = 2
mm/Km, the latter to account for any residual hydrostatic component, ~gd = 0
and two diﬀerent non-zero ~gw values, applied depending on the latitude of the
station. The geometry of the rays for the 1st February 1997 in the Kilauea
network has been used to generate the simulated rays. The PWD for each ray
li, where ˆNi is the pseudo-wet
has been formed according to Lsim =
P
refractivity associated to voxel i and li is the length of the ray across this voxel.
The weight of the constraints was tuned to give the best ﬁt with simulations,
successively adding the constraints in the horizontal plane, then the vertical
smoothing constraints, and ﬁnally adding a zero value constraint for the highest
layer. In Figure 1 we show the error in reconstructing the simulated ﬁeld.

Vertical reconstruction has also been veriﬁed adding a perturbation at dif-
ferent heights to the simulated ﬁelds of Equation 3.1; good vertical resolution
is achieved thanks to the distribution in height of the stations. We also note
(see Figure 1) that vertical reconstruction is gradually lost as the perturbation
is placed at higher altitudes (above 2 Km, resolution starts degrading). How-
ever, when the boundary constraint kicks in, the solution agrees again with the
simulated ﬁeld, slowly decaying to zero.

The impact of noise in the rays has also been considered. Following the data
processing described above, we have seen that post-ﬁt residuals are dependent
on elevation (roughly as 1/sin(e), where e is the elevation); therefore, we can
assume a noise value for the ZWD, then map it to the slant directions, and add
it to the total simulated delay. We show in Figure 2 the results of the noise
analysis. As it can be seen, a ZWD noise of 0.5 cm represents a noise in the
solution of less than 3 mm/Km rms (about 2% of the maximum value).

3.3. Results from the Kilauea network

Pseudo-wet delays from the Kilauea network in Hawaii have been input to the
system. We have processed data from 18 stations for February 1st, 1997. We
have used LOTTOS considering 4x4 voxels of 6′ in latitude and 7′ in longitude,
41 layers of 350 m height and 30-minutes batches for the Kalman ﬁlter. The
tomographic ﬁelds have then been used to generate the reconstructed PWD
which, in turn, have been processed to calculate the horizontal gradients and
ZWD for each station. These have been compared to those obtained with GOA
II. In Figure 3 we show the magnitude and direction of the 24-h mean value
of the gradient as calculated using GOA II (yellow) and using the tomographic
solution (green). In Figure 4 we show the time series of these magnitudes for
a particular station (PGF3) and in Table 1 we show the correlation values over
time for each station. This shows that the reconstructed 4D ﬁeld is consistent
with the data. Vertical distribution is shown in Figure 5 for a given latitude
and time. We have computed the values of ˆN (~r, t) proﬁles with data from the
European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis and

compared with our tomographic proﬁles, averaging them to meet the ECMWF
maps resolution of 0.5 degrees. Results are presented for three diﬀerent hours
(06h, 12h and 18h) in Figure 6 showing good agreement.

4. Conclusions

We have successfully obtained tomographic 4D images of the pseudo-wet re-
fractivity for a local dense network. The concept of slant pseudo-wet delays
has been introduced. Simulated ﬁelds have been used to validate and tune our
LOTTOS software package. Finally, data from the Kilauea network have been
processed and the reconstructed 4D ﬁelds of the refractivity have been com-
pared with on-site estimated horizontal gradients and ECMWF vertical proﬁles,
yielding good correlation in both cases. Although more work is needed in this
area, our results provide the proof-of-concept of the tomographic inversion of
tropospheric GPS data.

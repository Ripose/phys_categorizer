The structure of a river network may be seen as a discrete set of nested sub-networks built out
of individual stream segments. These network components are assigned an integral stream order
via a hierarchical and discrete ordering method. Exponential relationships, known as Horton’s
laws, between stream order and ensemble-averaged quantities pertaining to network components
are observed. We extend these observations to incorporate ﬂuctuations and all higher moments
by developing functional relationships between distributions. The relationships determined are
drawn from a combination of theoretical analysis, analysis of real river networks including the
Mississippi, Amazon and Nile, and numerical simulations on a model of directed, random networks.
Underlying distributions of stream segment lengths are identiﬁed as exponential. Combinations of
these distributions form single-humped distributions with exponential tails, the sums of which are
in turn shown to give power law distributions of stream lengths. Distributions of basin area and
stream segment frequency are also addressed. The calculations identify a single length-scale as a
measure of size ﬂuctuations in network components. This article is the second in a series of three
addressing the geometry of river networks.

INTRODUCTION

Branching networks are an important category of all
networks with river networks being a paradigmatic exam-
ple. Probably as much as any other natural phenomena,
river networks are a rich source of scaling laws [1, 2, 3].
Central quantities such as drainage basin area and stream
lengths are reported to closely obey power-law statis-
tics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The origin of this scaling
has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms includ-
ing, among others: principles of optimality [1, 9], self-
organized criticality [10], invasion percolation [11], and
random ﬂuctuations [3, 12, 13, 14]. One of the diﬃcul-
ties in establishing any theory is that the reported values
of scaling exponents show some variation [6, 7, 15].

With this variation in mind, we have in [16] extensive-
ly examined Hack’s law, the scaling relationship between
basin shape and stream length. Such scaling laws are
inherently broad-brushed in their descriptive content. In
an eﬀort to further improve comparisons between theo-
ry and data and, more importantly, between networks
themselves, we consider here a generalization of Horton’s
laws [17, 18]. Deﬁned fully in the following section, Hor-
ton’s laws describe how average values of network param-
eters change with a certain discrete renormalization of

the network. The introduction of these laws by Horton
may be seen as one of many examples that presaged the
theory of fractal geometry [19]. In essence, they express
the relative frequency and size of network components
such as stream segments and drainage basins.

Here, we extend Horton’s laws to functional relation-
ships between probability distributions rather than sim-
ply average values. The recent work of Peckham and
Gupta was the ﬁrst to address this natural generaliza-
tion of Horton’s laws [20]. Our work agrees with their
ﬁndings but goes further to characterize the distributions
and develop theoretical links between the distributions of
several diﬀerent parameters. We also present empirical
studies that reveal underlying scaling functions with a
focus on ﬂuctuations and further consider deviations due
to ﬁnite-size eﬀects.

We examine continent-scale networks: the Mississippi,
Amazon, Congo, Nile and Kansas river basins. As in [16],
we also examine Scheidegger’s model of directed, random
networks [13]. Both real and model networks provide
important tests and motivations for our generalizations
of Horton’s laws.

We begin with deﬁnitions of stream ordering and Hor-
ton’s laws. Thereafter, the paper is divided into two main
sections.
In Section III, we ﬁrst sketch the theoretical
generalization of Horton’s laws. Estimates of the Horton
ratios are carried out in Section IV and these provide
basic parameters of the generalized laws. Empirical evi-
dence from real continent-scale networks is then provid-
ed along with data from Scheidegger’s random network

model in Section V. In Section VI we derive the high-
er order moments for stream length distributions and in
Section VII, we consider deviations from Horton’s laws
for large basins. In the Appendix A, we expand on some
of the connections outlined in Section V, presenting a
number of mathematical considerations on these gener-
alized Horton distributions.

This paper is the second in a series of three on the
geometry of river networks. In the ﬁrst [16] we address
issues of scaling and universality and provide further
motivation for our general investigation.
In the third
article of the series [21] we extend the work of the present
paper by examining how the detailed architecture of river
networks, i.e., how network components ﬁt together.

II. STREAM ORDERING AND HORTON’S

LAWS

Stream ordering was ﬁrst introduced by Horton in an
eﬀort to quantify the features of river networks [17].
The method was later improved by Strahler to give
the present technique of Horton-Strahler stream order-
ing [22]. Stream ordering is a method applicable to any
ﬁeld where branching, hierarchical networks are impor-
tant. Indeed, much use of stream ordering has been made
outside of the context of river networks, a good example
being the study of venous and arterial blood networks
in biology [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. We describe
two conceptions of the method and then discuss empirical
laws deﬁned with in the context of stream ordering.

A network’s constituent stream segments are ordered
by an iterative pruning. An example of stream ordering
for the Mississippi basin is shown in Figure 1. A source
stream is deﬁned as a section of stream that runs from
a channel head to a junction with another stream (for
an arboreal analogy, think of the leaves of a tree). These
source streams are classiﬁed as the ﬁrst order stream seg-
ments of the network. Next, remove these source streams
and identify the new source streams of the remaining net-
work. These are the second order stream segments. The
process is repeated until one stream segment is left of
order Ω. The order of the network is then deﬁned to be
Ω.

Once stream ordering on a network has been done, a
number of natural quantities arise. These include nω, the
number of basins (or equivalently stream segments) for
a given order ω; hlωi, the average main stream length;
hl (s)
ω i, the average stream segment length; haωi, the
average basin area; and the variation in these numbers
from order to order. Horton [17] and later Schumm [18]
observed that the following ratios are generally indepen-
dent of order ω:

nω
nω+1

= Rn,

hliω+1
hliω

that the Horton ratio for stream segment lengths R
l(s) is
equivalent to Rl. Because our theory will start with the
distributions of l(s), we will generally use the ratio R
l(s)
in place of Rl.

ν=1

Horton’s laws have remained something of a mystery
in geomorphology—the study of earth surface processes
and form—due to their apparent robustness and hence
perceived lack of physical (or geological) content. How-
ever, statements that Horton’s laws are “statistically
inevitable” [31], while possibly true, have not yet been
based on reasonable assumptions [3]. Furthermore, many
other scaling laws can be shown to follow in part from
Horton’s laws [8]. Thus, Horton’s laws being without
content would imply the same is true for those scaling
laws that follow from them. Other suﬃcient assump-
tions include uniform drainage density (i.e., networks are
space-ﬁlling) and self-aﬃnity of single channels. The lat-
ter can be expressed as the relation [7, 32, 33, 34]

l ∝ Ld
k,

(2)

where Lk is the longitudinal diameter of a basin. Scaling
relations may be derived and the set of relevant scaling
exponents can be reduced to just two: d as given above
and the ratio ln Rl(s) / ln Rn [8]. Note that one obtains
Ra ≡ Rn so that only the two Horton ratios Rn and
Rl(s) are independent. Horton ratios are thus of central
importance in the full theory of scaling for river networks.

III. POSTULATED FORM OF HORTON

DISTRIBUTIONS

Horton’s laws relate quantities which are indexed by
a discrete set of numbers, namely the stream orders.
They also algebraically relate mean quantities such as
¯aω. Hence we may consider a generalization to func-
tional relationships between probability distributions. In
other words, for stream lengths and drainage areas we
can explore the relationships between probability distri-
butions deﬁned for each order.

Furthermore, as we have noted, Horton’s laws can be
used to derive power laws of continuous variables such as
the probability distributions of drainage area a and main
stream length l [7, 8, 35]:

P (a) ∝ a−τ

and

P (l) ∝ l−γ.

(3)

These derivations necessarily only give discrete points of
power laws. In other words, the derivations give points as
functions of the discrete stream order ω and are uniform-
ly spaced logarithmically and we interpolate the power
law from there. The distributions for stream lengths and
areas must therefore have structures that when combined
across orders produce smooth power laws.

ω

For the example of the stream segment length l (s)
ω ,
Horton’s laws state that the mean ¯l (s)
grows by a factor
l(s) with each integer step in order ω. In considering
of R
P (l (s)
ω , ω), the underlying probability distribution func-
tion for l (s)
ω , we postulate that Horton’s laws apply for
every moment of the distribution and not just the mean.
This generalization of Horton’s laws may be encapsulated
in a statement about the distribution P (l (s)

ω , ω) as

P (l (s)

ω , ω) = c

l(s) (RnR

l(s) )−ωF

l(s) (l (s)

ω R−ω

l(s) ).

(4)

(Rn)−ω

factor

indicates

R ∞

that
The
of
l(s)=0 dl(s)P (l (s)
i.e., the frequency
of stream segments of order ω decays according to
Horton’s law of stream number given in equation (1).
Similarly, for lω, aω and nΩ,ω, we write

ω , ω) ∝ (Rn)−ω,

the

P (lω, ω) = cl(RnRl(s) )−ωFl(lωR−ω

l(s) ),

P (aω, ω) = ca(R2

n)−ωFa(aωR−ω

n ),

and

P (nΩ,ω) = cn(Rn)Ω−ωFn(nΩ,ωR−ω

n ),

(5)

(6)

(7)

where constants cl(s) , cl, ca and cn are appropriate nor-
malizations. We have used the subscripted versions of the
lengths and areas, l (s)
ω , lω, and aω, to reinforce that these
parameters are for points at the outlets of order ω basins
only. The quantity nΩ,ω is the number of streams of order
ω within a basin of order Ω. This will help with some
notational issues later on. The form of the distribution

3

functions F
l(s) , Fl, Fa and Fn and their interrelationships
become the focus of our investigations. Since scaling is
inherent in each of these postulated generalizations of
Horton’s laws, we will often refer to these distribution
functions as scaling functions.

We further postulate that distributions of stream seg-
ment lengths are best approximated by exponential dis-
tributions. Empirical evidence for this will be provided
later on in Section V. The normalized scaling function
F
l(s) (u) of equation (4) then has the form

l(s) (u) =
F

1
ξ

e−u/ξ = F

l(s) (u; ξ),

(8)

where we have introduced a new length scale ξ and stated
its appearance with the notation F
l(s) (u; ξ). The value of
ξ is potentially network dependent. As we will show, dis-
tributions of main stream lengths, areas and stream num-
ber are all dependent on ξ and this is the only additional
parameter necessary for their description. Note that ξ is
both the mean and standard deviation of Fl(s) (u; ξ), i.e.,
for exponential distributions, ﬂuctuations of a variable
are on the order of its mean value. We may therefore
think of ξ as a ﬂuctuation length scale. Note that the
presence of exponential distributions indicates a random-
ness in the physical distribution of streams themselves
and this is largely the topic of our third paper [21].

i=1 l (s)

segment lengths, i.e. lω = Pω

Since main stream lengths are combinations of stream
ω , we have that the
distributions of main stream lengths of order ω basins
are approximated by convolutions of the stream segment
length distributions. For this step, it is more appropriate
to use conditional probabilities such as P (l (s)
ω |ω) where
the basin order ω is taken to be ﬁxed. We thus write

1|1) ∗ P (l(s)

2|2) ∗ ··· P (l (s)

P (lω|ω) = P (l(s)

(9)
where ∗ denotes convolution. Details of the form
obtained are given in Appendix A 1.
The next step takes us to the power law distribution
for main stream lengths. Summing over all stream orders
and integrating over u = lω we have

ω |ω).

duP (u, ω),

(10)

P (l) ≃

∞

Xω=1Z ∞

u=l

where we have returned to the joint probability for this
calculation. The integral over u is replaced by a sum
when networks are considered on discrete lattices. Note
that the probability of ﬁnding a main stream of length
l is independent of any sort of stream ordering since it
is deﬁned on an unordered network. The details of this
calculation may be found in Appendix A 2 where it is
shown that a power law P (l) ∝ l−γ follows from the
deduced form of the P (lω, ω) with γ = ln Rn/ ln R

l(s) .

for the estimates of Rn and Ra. Good agreement is observed
between the ratios Rn and Ra and also between Rl and R

Figure 2(a) shows the stream order averages of l(s), l,
a and n for the Mississippi basin. Deviations from expo-
nential trends of Horton’s laws are evident and indicated
by deviations from straight lines on the semi-logarithmic
axis. Such deviations are to be expected for the smallest
and largest orders within a basin [8, 21]. For the small-
est orders, the scale of the grid used becomes an issue
but even with inﬁnite resolution, the scaling of lengths,
areas and number for low orders cannot all hold at the
same time [8]. For large orders, the decrease in sample
space contributes to these ﬂuctuations since the number
of samples of order ω streams decays exponentially with
order as (Rn)Ω−ω. Furthermore, correlations with over-
all basin shape provide another source of deviations [21].
Nevertheless, in our theoretical investigations below we
will presume exact scaling. Note also that the equiva-
lence of Rn and Ra is supported by Figure 2(b) where

ments Ra ≡ Rn and Rl ≡ Rl(s) are well supported. The
majority of ranges give Rn/Ra and Rl/R
l(s) very close to
unity. The averages are also close to one and are diﬀerent
from unity mostly by within 1.0 and uniformly by within
1.5 standard deviations.

The normalized deviations, ie., σ/µ, for the four ratios
are all below 0.05. No systematic ordering of the σ/µ is
observed. Of all the data, the values for Rl in the case
of the Mississippi are the most notably uniform having
σ/µ = 0.015. Throughout there is a slight trend for
regression on lower orders to overestimate and on higher
orders to underestimate the average ratios, while reason-
able consistency is found at intermediate orders.

Thus, overall the ranges chosen in the tables give a
reasonably even set of estimates of the Horton ratios and
we will use these averages as our estimates of the ratios.

V. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR HORTON

DISTRIBUTIONS

A. Stream segment length distributions

We now present Horton distributions for the Mississip-
pi, Amazon, and Nile river basins as well as the Schei-
degger model. Scheidegger networks may be thought
of as collections of random-walker streams and are ful-
ly deﬁned in [16] and extensively studied in [21]. The
forms of all distributions are observed to be the same in
the real data and in the model.

The ﬁrst distribution is shown in Figure 3(a). This
is the probability density function of l(s)
4, fourth order
stream segment lengths, for the Mississippi River. Dis-
tributions for diﬀerent orders can be rescaled to show

FIG. 3: Plot (a) shows an example distribution of stream seg-
ment lengths, P (l (s)
ω , ω), for the Mississippi for order ω = 4.
The lengths here are in kilometers. The semi-logarithmic axes
indicate the distribution is well approximated by an expo-
nential. The value of the length scale ξ (see equation (8)) is
estimated to be approximately 800 meters. Rescaled versions
of the same stream segment length distributions for ω = 3
(circles), ω = 4 (squares), ω = 5 (triangles), and ω = 6 (dia-
monds), are shown in (b). The rescaling is done according
to equation (4). The values of the Horton ratios used are
Rn = 4.69 and R

l(s) = 2.33 as determined from Table I

satisfactory agreement. This is done using the postulat-
ed Horton distribution of stream segment lengths given
in equation (4). The rescaling is shown in Figure 3(b)
and is for orders ω = 3, . . . , 6. Note the eﬀect of the
exponential decrease in number of samples with order
is evident for ω = 6 since P (l(s)
6) is considerably scat-
tered. Nevertheless, the ﬁgure shows the form of these
distributions to be most closely approximated by expo-
nentials. We observe similar exponential distributions for
the Amazon, the Nile and the Scheidegger model. The
ﬂuctuation length scale ξ is found to be approximately
800 meters for the Mississippi, 1600 meters for the Ama-
zon and 1200 meters for the Nile.

Since ξ is based on the deﬁnition of stream ordering,
comparisons of ξ are only sensible for networks that are
measured on topographies with the same resolution. The
above values of ξ are approximate and our conﬁdence
in them would be improved with higher resolution data.
Nevertheless they do suggest that ﬂuctuations in net-
work structure increase as we move from the Mississippi
through to the Nile and then the Amazon.

FIG. 4: Plot (a) shows an example distribution for order
ω = 5 main stream lengths (measured in km) for the Ama-
zon. The distribution is unimodal with what is a reasonable
approximation of an exponential tail. In (b), distributions of
main stream length for for ω = 3 (circles), ω = 4 (squares),
ω = 5 (triangles), and ω = 6 (diamonds), are rescaled accord-
ing to equation (5). The values of the Horton ratios used here
are Rn = 4.51 and R

l(s) = 2.17, taken from Table II.

FIG. 5: Given in (a) is an example distribution of order
ω = 6 main stream lengths for the Scheidegger model. The
same form is observed as for real networks such as the Amazon
(Figure 4). In the same way as Figure 4(b), (b) show rescaled
distributions of main stream length for for ω = 4 (circles), ω =
5 (squares), ω = 6 (triangles), and ω = 7 (diamonds). Note
that in (b), distributions are not normalized with respect to a
ﬁxed basin order Ω and hence the vertical oﬀset is arbitrary.
The values of the ratios used here are Rn ≃ 5.20 and Rl ≃
3.00 [8].

B. Main stream segment length distributions

The distributions of ω = 4 main stream lengths for
the Amazon River is shown in Figure 4(a). Since main
stream lengths are sums of stream segment lengths, their
distribution has a single peak away from the origin. How-
ever, these distributions will not tend towards a Gaus-
sian because the individual stream length distributions
do not satisfy the requirements of the central limit theo-
rem [39]. This is because the moments of the stream seg-
ment length distributions grow exponentially with stream
order. As the semi-logarithmic axes indicate, the tail may
be reasonably well (but not exactly) modeled by expo-
nentials. There is some variation in the distribution tails
from region to region. For example, corresponding dis-
tributions for the Mississippi data do exhibit tails that
are closer to exponentials. However, for the present work
where we are attempting to characterize the basic forms
of the Horton distributions, we consider these deviations
to be of a higher order nature and belonging to the realm
of further research.

In accord with equation (5), Figure 4(b) shows the
rescaling of the main stream length distributions for
ω = 3, . . . , 6. The ratios used, Rn = 4.49 and Rl =
l(s) = 2.17) are taken from Table II. Given
2.19(≃ R

the scatter of the distributions, it is unreasonable to per-
form minimization techniques on the rescaled data itself
in order to estimate Rn and Rl. This is best done by
examining means, as we have done, and higher order
moments which we discuss below. Furthermore, varying
Rn and Rl from the above values by, say, ±0.05 does not
greatly distort the visual quality of the “data collapse.”
Similar results for the Scheidegger model are shown in
Figure 5. The Scheidegger model may be thought of as
a network deﬁned on a triangular lattice where at each
lattice site one of two directions is chosen as the stream
path [16, 21]. Figure 5(a) gives a single example distribu-
tion for main stream lengths of order ω = 6 basins. The
tail is exponential as per the real world data. Figure 5(b)
shows a collapse of main stream length distributions for
orders ω = 4 through 7.
In contrast to the real data
where an overall basin order is ﬁxed (Ω), there is no max-
imum basin order here. The distributions in Figure 5(b)
have an arbitrary normalization meaning the absolute
values of the ordinate are also arbitrary. Otherwise, this
is the same collapse as given in equation (5). For the
Scheidegger model, our simulations yield Rn ≃ 5.20 and
Rl(s) ≃ 3.00 [8]. For all distributions, we observe similar
functional forms for real networks and the Scheidegger

FIG. 7: Summation of main stream length distributions for
the Mississippi. Both axes are logarithmic,the unit of length
is km and the vertical axis is probability density with units
of km−1. Distributions of lω for orders ω = 3 (circles), ω = 4
(squares), and ω = 5 (triangles), are shown. As expected, the
distributions sum together to give a power law tail (stars).
The power law distribution (which is vertically oﬀset by an
order of magnitude for clarity) is the summation of the dis-
tributions below as well as the distribution for order ω = 6
main stream lengths.

C. Drainage area distributions

D. Summing distributions to form power laws

Figure 6 shows more Horton distributions, this time for
drainage area as calculated for the Nile river basin. In
Figure 6, an example distribution for ω = 4 sub-basins is
presented. The distribution is similar in form to those of
main stream lengths of Figure 4, again showing a reason-
ably clear exponential tail. Rescaled drainage area dis-
tributions for ω = 3, . . . , 6 are presented in Figure 6(b).
The rescaling now follows equation (6). Note that if Rn
and Ra were not equivalent, the rescaling would be of the
form

P (aω, ω) = ca(RnRa)−ωFa(aωR−ω

a ).

(11)

Since we have asserted that Rn ≡ Ra, equation (11)
reduces to equation (6). The Horton ratio used here is
Rn = 4.42 which is in good agreement with Ra = 4.53,
the respective standard deviations being 0.17 and 0.10.
Both ﬁgures are taken from the data of Table III.

As stated in Section III, the Horton distributions of
aω and lω must combine to form power law distributions
for a and l (see equations 3 and 10). Figure 7 provides
empirical support for this observation for the example
main stream lengths of the Mississippi network. The
distributions for ω = 3, 4 and 5 main stream lengths
are individually shown. Their combination together with
the distribution of l6 gives the reasonable approximation
of a power law as shown. The area distributions com-
bine in the same way. Note that the distributions do not
greatly overlap. Each point of the power law is therefore
the addition of signiﬁcant contributions from only two or
three of the separate distributions. The challenge here
then is to understand how rescaled versions of Fl, being
the basic form of the P (lω, ω), ﬁt together in such a clean
fashion. The details of this connection are established in
Appendix A 2.

E. Connecting distributions of number and area

In considering the generalized Horton distributions for
number and area, we observe two main points: a calcula-
tion in the vein of what we are able to do for main stream
lengths is diﬃcult; and, the Horton distributions for area
and number are equivalent.

In principle, Horton area distributions may be derived
from stream segment length distributions. This follows
from an assumption of statistically uniform drainage den-
sity which means that the typical drainage area drained
per unit length of any stream is invariant in space. Apart
from the possibility of changing with space which we will
preclude by assumption, drainage density does naturally

ﬂuctuate as well [16]. Thus, we can write a ≃ ρPω l (s)

where the sum is over all orders and all stream segments
and ρ is the average drainage density.

ω

However, we need to know for an example basin, how
many instances of each stream segment occur as a func-
tion of order. For example, the number of ﬁrst order
streams in an order Ω basins is nΩ,1. Given the distri-
bution of this number, we can then calculate the distri-
bution of the total contribution of drainage area due to
ﬁrst order streams. But the distributions of nΩ,ω are not
independent so we cannot proceed in this direction.

We could potentially use the typical number of order
ω streams, (Rn)Ω−ω. Then the distribution of total area
drained due to order ω streams would approach Gaussian
because the individual distribution are identical and the
central limit theorem would apply. However, because the
ﬂuctuations in total number of stream segments are so
great, we lose too much information with this approach.
Indeed, the distribution of area drained by order ω stream
segments in a basin reﬂects variations in their number
rather than length. Again, we meet up with the prob-
lem of the numbers of distinct orders of stream segment
lengths being dependent.

One ﬁnal way would be to use Tokunaga’s law [8, 40,
41, 42, 43]. Tokunaga’s law states that the number of
order ν side branches along an (absorbing) stream seg-
ment of order µ is given by

Tk = T1(R

l(s) )k+1.

(12)

where k = µ − ν. The parameter T1 is the average num-
ber of side streams having order ν = µ− 1 for every order
µ absorbing stream. This gives a picture of how a net-
work ﬁts together and may be seen to be equivalent to
Horton’s laws [8]. Now, even though we also understand
the distributions underlying Tokunaga’s law [16], similar
technical problems arise. On descending into a network,
we ﬁnd the number of stream segments at each level to
be dependent on all of the above.

Nevertheless, we can understand the relationship
between the distributions for area and number. What
follows is a generalization of the ﬁnding that Rn ≡ Ra.
The postulated forms for these distributions were giv-
en in equations (6) and (7). Consider nΩ,1, the num-

FIG. 8: Comparison of number and area distributions for the
Scheidegger model. Area is in terms of lattice units. In the
inset plot, the raw distributions shown are P (a6|6) (circles)
and P (n6,1|6) (continuous line). The latter is the probability
of ﬁnding n6,1 source streams in an order ω = 6 basin. In the
main plot, the number distribution has been rescaled to be
1/4P (n6,1|6) as a function of 4n6,1 and the area distribution
is unrescaled (the symbols are the same as for the inset plot).
For the Scheidegger model, source streams occur at any site
with probability of 1/4, hence the rescaling by a factor of four.

ber of ﬁrst order streams in an order Ω basin. Assum-
ing that, on average, ﬁrst order streams are distributed
evenly throughout a network, then this number is simply
proportional to aΩ. As an example, Figure 8 shows data
obtained for the Scheidegger model. For the Scheidegger
model, ﬁrst order streams are initiated with a 1/4 proba-
bility when the ﬂow at the two upstream sites is randomly
directed away, each with probability 1/2. Thus, for an
area aΩ, we expect and ﬁnd nΩ,ω = aΩ/4.

For higher internal orders, we can apply a simple
renormalization. Assuming a system with exact scaling,
the number of streams nΩ,ω is statistically equivalent to
nΩ−ω+1,1. Since the latter is proportional to aΩ−ω+1 we
have that

nΩ,ω ≃ ρωaΩ−ω+1

(13)

where the constant of proportionality is the density of
order ω streams, Clearly, this equivalence improves as
number increases, i.e., the diﬀerence Ω − ω increases.
While we do not have exact forms for the area or num-
ber distributions, we note that they are similar to the
main stream length distributions. Since source streams

FIG. 9: A comparison of moments calculated for main stream
length distributions for the Mississippi River.

We can now determine the log-space separation of
moments of main stream length. Using Stirling’s approx-
imation [44] that ln n! ∼ (n + 1/2) ln n − n we have

are linear basins with the width of a grid cell, the dis-
tribution of a1 is the same as the distribution of l1 and
l(s)
1, a pure exponential. Hence, nΩ,Ω−1 is also an expo-
nential. For increasing ω, the distribution of aω becomes
single peaked with an exponential tail, qualitatively the
same as the main stream length distributions.

lnh(lω)qi ∼ qhξ + (R

l(s) )ω + ln qi + C,

(17)

where C is a constant. The ln q term inside the square
brackets in equation 17 creates small deviations from lin-
earity for 1 ≤ ω ≤ 15. Thus, in agreement with Figure 9,
we expect approximately linear growth of moments in
log-space.

VI. HIGHER ORDER MOMENTS

VII. LIMITATIONS ON THE PREDICTIVE

POWER OF HORTON’S LAWS

Finally, we discuss the higher order moments for the
generalized Horton distributions.
Figure 9 presents
moments for distributions of main stream lengths for the
case of the Mississippi. These moments are calculated
directly from the main stream length distributions. A
regular logarithmic spacing is apparent in moments for
orders ranging from 3 to 7.

To see whether or not this is expected, we detail a
few small calculations concerning moments starting from
the exponential form of stream segment lengths given in
equation (8). As noted previously, for an exponential
l(s) (u) = ξ−1e−u/ξ, the mean is simply
distribution, F
hui = ξ. In general, the qth moment of an exponential
distribution is

u=0

Assuming scaling holds exactly for across all orders,
the above is precisely h(l(s)
1)qi =

1)qi. Note that h(l(s)

xqe−xdx = q!ξq.

(14)

x=0

In this last section, we brieﬂy examine deviations from
scaling within this generalized picture of Horton’s laws.
The basic question is given an approximate scaling for
quantities measured at intermediate stream orders, what
can we say about the features of the overall basin?

As noted in the previous section, all moments of the
generalized Horton distributions grow exponentially with
order. Coupling this with the fact that nω ∝ R−ω
n , i.e.,
the number of samples of order ω basins decreases expo-
nentially with ω, we observe that a basin’s a and l will
potentially diﬀer greatly from values predicted by Hor-
ton’s laws.

To illustrate this, Figure 10 speciﬁcally shows the dis-
tributions P (l3) and P (l4) scaled up to give P (l11) for
the Congo river. The actual Congo’s length measured
at this 1000 meter resolution is represented by the sol-
id line and is around 57% of the distribution’s mean as
indicated by the dashed line. Nevertheless, we see that
the measured length is within a standard deviation of the
predicted value.

In Table IV, we provide a comparison of predicted
versus measured main stream lengths and areas for the

FIG. 10: Comparing the generalized Horton length distri-

(squares) and ω = 4 (circles) stream lengths and the Horton
ratio is estimated to be Rl = 2.39 [45]. The dashed line rep-
resents the mean of these scaled up distributions while the
solid line marks ¯l11, the measured length of the Congo at a
1000 meter resolution. The actual length is within a standard
deviation of the mean being around 50% of ¯l11. Table IV

and length data.

of stream lengths and areas.

Thus, we see that by using a probabilistic point of view,
this generalized notion of Horton’s laws provides a way of
discerning the strength of deviations about the expected
mean. In general, stronger deviations would imply that
geologic conditions play a more signiﬁcant role in setting
the structure of the network.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The objective of this work has been to explore
the underlying distributions of river network quantities
deﬁned with stream ordering. We have shown that func-
tional relationships generalize all cases of Horton’s laws.
We have identiﬁed the basic forms of the distributions for
stream segment lengths (exponential) and main stream
lengths (convolutions of exponentials) and shown a link
between number and area distributions. Data from the
continent-scale networks of the Mississippi, Amazon, and
Nile river basins as well as from Scheidegger’s model of
directed random networks provide both agreement with
and inspiration for the generalizations of Horton’s laws.
Finally, we have identiﬁed a ﬂuctuation length scale ξ
which is a reinterpretation of what was previously iden-
tiﬁed as only a mean value. We see the study of the
generalized Horton distributions as integral to increas-
ing our understanding of river network structure. We
also suggest that practical network analysis be extended
to measurements of distributions and the length scale ξ
with the aim of reﬁning our ability to distinguish and
compare network structure.

APPENDIX A: ANALYTIC CONNECTIONS

BETWEEN STREAM LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS

In this appendix we consider a series of analytic cal-
culations. These concern the connections between the
distributions of stream segment lengths l (s)
ω , ordered
basin main stream lengths lω and main stream lengths
l. We will idealize the problem in places, assuming per-
fect scaling and inﬁnite networks while making an occa-
sional salubrious approximation. Also, we will treat the
problem of lengths fully noting that derivations of dis-
tributions for areas follow similar but more complicated
lines.

We begin by rescaling the form of stream segment

length distributions

P (l (s)

ω , ω) = (Rn − 1)(RnR

l(s) )−ωF

l(s) (lR−ω

l(s)).

(A1)

The normalization c
ment that

l(s) = Rn − 1 stems from the require-
Z ∞

F
l(s) (u) = 1,

(A2)

u=0

which is made purely for aesthetic purposes. As we have
suggested in equation (8) and demonstrated empirical
support for, F
l(s) (u) is well approximated by the expo-
nential distribution ξ−1e−u/ξ. For low u and also we have
noted that deviations do of course occur but they are suf-
ﬁciently insubstantial as to be negligible for a ﬁrst order
treatment of the problem.

1. Distributions of main stream lengths as a

function of stream order

We now derive a form for the distribution of main
stream lengths P (lω|ω). As we have discussed, since

11

i=1 l (s)

lω = Pω

ω , we have the convolution (9). The right-
hand side of equation (9) consists of exponentials as per
equation (8) so we now consider the function Kω(u; ~a)
given by

Kω(u; ~a) = a1e−a1u ∗ a2e−a2u ∗ ··· ∗ aωe−aωu,

(A3)

where ~a = (a1, a2, . . . , aω). We are speciﬁcally interested
in the case when no two of the ai are equal, i.e., ai 6= aj
for all i 6= j. To compute this ω-fold convolution, we
simply examine the Kω(u; ~a) for ω = 2 and ω = 3 and
identify the emerging pattern. For ~a = (a1, a2) we have,
omitting the prefactors for the time being,

e−a1u ∗ e−a2u
=
a1 − a2

e−a1u − e−a2u

=

e−a1u
a1 − a2

+

e−a2u
a2 − a1

(A4)

providing a1 6= a2. Convolving this with e−a3u we obtain
(cid:19) ∗ e−a3u

e−a1u ∗ e−a2u ∗ e−a3u =(cid:18) e−a1u − e−a2u

In reaching the last line we have shifted the indices in
several places.
In the last bracketed term we have set
k = j − i and then m = n − i while in the ﬁrst bracketed
term, we have used −k = j − i. Immediately of note is
that the last term is independent of i and may thus be
ignored.

The ﬁrst bracketed term does depend on i but con-
verges rapidly. Writing Di = Qi−1
k=1(1 − r−k) we have
that Di = DmQi−1
k=m(1− r−k). Taking m to be ﬁxed and
large enough such that 1 − r−k is approximated well by
exp{−r−k} for k ≥ m, we then have
−r−k) ,
(1 − 1/ri−m−1)(cid:27) . (A11)
As i → ∞, Di clearly approaches a product of Dm and
a constant. Therefore, the ﬁrst bracketed term in equa-
tion (A10) may also be neglected in an asymptotic anal-
ysis.

Di = Dm exp( i−1
Xk=m
= Dm exp(cid:26) r1−m
(r − 1)

Hence, as i → ∞, the coeﬃcients Ci are simply given

by

that P (0, ω) = 0 for all ω > 1 since all convolutions of
pairs of exponentials vanish at the origin. Furthermore,
the tail of the distribution is dominated by the exponen-
tial corresponding to the largest stream segment.

The next step is to connect to the power law distribu-
tion of main stream lengths, P (l) (see Figure 7 and the
accompanying discussion). On considering equation (10)
we see that the problem can possibly be addressed with
some form of asymptotic analysis.

Before attacking this calculation however, we will sim-
plify the notation keeping only the important details of
the P (lω, ω). Our main interest is to see how equa-
tion (10) gives rise to a power law. We transform the
outcome of equation (A7) by using n = ω, u = lω/ξ,
r = R
l(s) , and s = Rn, neglecting multiplicative con-
stants and then summing over stream orders to obtain

The integration over lω has been omitted meaning that
the result will be a power law with one power lower than
expected.

2. Power law distributions of main stream lengths

We now show that this sum of exponentials G(u) in
equation (A8) does in fact asymptotically tend to a power
law. We ﬁrst interchange the order of summation replac-

n=i to give

and we can approximate G(u) as, boldly using the equal-

We thus simply have a sum of exponentials to contend
with. The coeﬃcients Ci appear unwieldy at ﬁrst but

s = rγ.

(A14)

We turn now to the asymptotic behavior of S(u), this
being the ﬁnal stretch of our analysis

There are several directions one may take at this
point. We will proceed by employing a transformation
of S(u) that is sometimes referred to as the Sommerfeld-
Watson transformation and also as Watson’s lemma [46,
p. 239]. Given a sum over any set of integers I, say

S = Pn∈I f (n), it can be written as the following inte-

gral

S =

1

2πiIC

π cos πz
sin πz

f (z)dz.

(A15)

where C is a contour that contains the points on the real
axis n + i0 where n ∈ I and none of the points of the
same form with n ∈ Z/I. Calculation of the residues of
the simple poles of the integrand return us to the original
sum.

Applying the transformation to S(u) we obtain

S(u) =

1

2πiIC

The transformed contour C′ is depicted in Figure 12.

As u → ∞, the contribution to integral from the neigh-
borhood of ρ = 0 dominates. The introduction of the sin
and cos terms has created an interesting oscillation that
has to be handled with with some care. We now deform
the integration contour C′ into the contour C′′ of Fig-
ure 13 focusing on the interval along the imaginary axis
[−i, i]. Choosing this path will simplify the cos and sin
expressions which at present have logs in their arguments.
The integral S(u) is now given by S(u) ≃ I(u) + c.c.

(A21)

where δ(τ ) = τ 2iπ/ ln re−π2/ ln r. The integral I(u) now

l(s) ≈

1 − δ

We now need to show that the higher order terms are
negligible. Note that their magnitudes do no vanish
with increasing u but instead are highly oscillatory terms.
Using the asymptotic form of the Gamma function [47]

Γ(z) = zz−1/2e−z√2π (1 + O(1/z)) ,

(A28)

= 1 + 2δ + 2δ2 + 2δ3 + . . .

we can estimate as follows for large n that

Substituting uτ = w and replacing the upper limit w = u
with w = ∞ we have
In(u) = u−(1+γ+2niπ/ ln r)Z ∞
= (iu)−(1+γ+2niπ/ ln r)Z ∞

(A26)

0

Here, we have rotated the contour along the imaginary
iw-axis to the real v-axis and identiﬁed the integral with
the gamma function Γ [44]. The integral can now be
expressed as

I(u) =

1

= e−π2n/ ln rnγ+1/2(2π/e)1+γ(ln r)−1/2−γ.

(A29)
Hence, Γ(1 + γ + 2niπ/ ln r) vanishes exponentially with
n. For the ﬁrst few values of n taking γ = 3/2 and
r = 2.5, we have Γ(1 + γ + 2iπ/ ln r) ≃ 2.5 × 10−3 and
Γ(1 + γ + 4iπ/ ln r) ≃ 2.1 × 10−6 showing that these
corrections are negligible.

Hence we are able estimate S(u) to ﬁrst order as

S(u) ≃

1
ln r

u−1−γ.

(A30)

Thus we have determined that a power law follows from
the initial assumption that stream segment lengths follow
exponential distributions.

This equivalence has been drawn as an asymptotic one,
albeit one where convergences have been shown to be
rapid. The calculation is clearly not the entire picture
as the solution does contain small rapidly-oscillating cor-
rections that do not vanish with increasing argument. A
possible remaining problem and one for further investi-
gation is to understand how the distributions for main
stream lengths lω ﬁt together over a range that is not to
be considered asymptotic. Nevertheless, the preceding
is one attempt at demonstrating this rather intriguing
breakup of a smooth power law into a discrete family of
functions built up from one fundamental scaling function.

[36] The Misssissippi river network was extracted from a
topography dataset composed of digital elevations mod-
els obtained from the United States Geological Survey
and are available on the Internet at www.usgs.gov. The
dataset is decimated so as to have horizontal resolution
of approximately 1000 meters leading to an order Ω = 11
network.

[37] The topography dataset used for the Amazon was
obtained from the website of the National Imagery and
Mapping Agency (www.nima.mil). The dataset has a hor-
izontal resolution of approximately 1000 meters yielding
and order Ω = 11 network for the Amazon.

[38] The data for the Nile comes from the United States Geo-
logical Survey’s 30 arc second Hydro1K dataset, avaliable
on the Internet at edcftp.cr.usgs.gov, which has a grid
spacing of approximately 1000 meters. At this resolution,
the Nile is an order Ω = 10 basin.

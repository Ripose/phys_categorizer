Abstract

Seeing the Earth crust as crisscrossed by faults ﬁlled with ﬂuid at close to lithostatic pres-
sures, we develop a model in which its elastic modulii are different in incremental tension
versus compression. For a given earthquake source, such nonlinear elasticity is shown to (i)
rotate, widen or narrow the different lobes of stress transfer, (ii) to modify the 1/r2 2D-decay
of elastic Green functions into the generalized power law 1/rγ where 0 < γ ≤ 2 decreases
with increasing tension-compression asymmetry and depends on the azimuth, (iii) to rotate the
geometric fault plane away from the nodal moment tensor planes. Using reasonable estimates,
this implies an enhancement of the range of interaction between earthquakes by a factor up
to 5 − 10 and a mismatch of up to 10◦ − 25◦ between the static (geological) fault plane and
the rupture plane deduced from moment tensor inversion. This may explain certain long-range
earthquake triggering and hydrological anomalies in wells and suggest to revisit the standard
stress tranfer calculations which use linear elasticity.

There are many evidences that faults and earthquakes interact, as suggested by calculations of
stress redistribution [1], elastodynamic propagation of ruptures using laboratory-based friction law
[2, 3], simpliﬁed models of multiple faults [4, 5], as well as general constraints of kinematic and
geometric compatibility of the deformations [6]. Maybe the simplest mechanism for earthquake in-
teraction involves stress re-distribution, both static [7, 1] and dynamical [8] associated with a given
earthquake modeled as a set of dislocations or cracks. In this simple mechanical view, earthquakes
cast stress shadows in lobes of stress unloading [9, 7] and increase the probability of rupture in
zones of stress increase [10], according to the laws of linear elasticity. These elastic stress transfer
models are useful for their conceptual simplicity and are increasingly used [11].

However, such elastic stress transfer models seem unable to account for a growing phenomenol-
ogy of long-range earthquake interactions. For instance, many large earthquakes have been pre-
ceded by an increase in the number of intermediate sized events over very broad areas [12]. The
relation between these intermediate sized events and the subsequent main event has only recently
been recognized on a large scale because the precursory events occur over such a large area that

1

they do not ﬁt prior deﬁnitions of foreshocks [13]. In particular, the 11 earthquakes in California
with magnitudes greater than 6.8 in the last century are associated with an increase of precursory
intermediate magnitude earthquakes measured in a running time window of ﬁve years [14]. What
is strange about the result is that the precursory pattern occured with distances of the order of 300
to 500 km from the futur epicenter, i.e. at distances up to ten times larger that the size of the fu-
tur earthquake rupture. Furthermore, the increased intermediate magnitude activity switched off
rapidly after a big earthquake in about half of the cases. This implies that stress changes due to
an earthquake of rupture dimension as small as 35 km can inﬂuence the stress distribution to dis-
tances more than ten times its size. These observations of earthquake-earthquake interactions over
long times and large spatial separations have been strengthened by several other works on different
catalogs using a variety of techniques [15]. These results defy usual mechanical models of linear
elasticity and one proposed explanation is that seismic cycles represent the approach to and retreat
from a critical state of a fault network [16, 15]. Another explanation involves dynamical stress trig-
gering [18] (see however [19]). Additional seismic, geophysical, and hydrogeological observations
[20] cannot be accounted for by using models derived from the elastic stress transfer mechanism.
In particular, standard poro-elastic models underestimate grossly the observed amplitudes of hydro-
geological anomalous rises and drops in wells at large distances from earthquakes.

We investigate the hypothesis, and its implications for the above observations, that the crust is a
nonlinear elastic medium characterized by an asymmetric response to compressive versus extensive
perturbations around the lithostatic stress. This hypothesis is made on the basis of the following
observations. We visualize the crust at seismogenic depth as crisscrossed by joints, cracks or faults
at many different scales ﬁlled with drained ﬂuid in contact with delocalized reservoirs at pressures
close to the lithostatic pressure [21]. Indeed, a lot of data [25] collectively support the existence of
signiﬁcant ﬂuid circulation to crustal depths of at least 10− 15km. Cracks and faults are considered
to be closed rough surfaces with anfractuosities ﬁlled with ﬂuid separated by contacts or asperities.
A compressive perturbation acts on the closed cracks by stressing their asperities and the medium
responds almost as an uncracked solid. Under an extensive perturbation, due to the fact that ﬂuid
pressure is almost always at rock pressure [21, 36], cracks open. As a consequence, the effective
large scale elastic strength reveals the damage state of the crust and is weaker than in compression.
By this mechanism, the nonlinearity is revealed for almost arbitrary small perturbations by the dif-
ference between compressive versus extensive perturbations around a mean lithostatic stress ﬁeld.
This is different from the ubiquitous nonlinearity of rocks, which becomes important only under
large deformation [41].

To keep the analysis straightforward, we calculate the stress transfer due to a strike-slip earth-
quake, modeled as a standard double-couple [42], with a rupture length larger than the thickness
of the seismogenic crust and we neglect the coupling between the crust and mantle. This allows
to use a two-dimensional plate model, which under a standard suitable adjustment of the rigidity
coefﬁcients can also be interpreted as either in-plane strain or in-plane stress. We do not consider
dynamical processes such as ﬂuid migration or viscous ﬂow. The mechanical plate is discretized
into a square lattice with springs along the bonds of length a linking nearest neighbors and along
the diagonals linking second-nearest neighbors. The diagonal springs ensure a non-vanishing shear
strength [45]. The simplest and most general nonlinear property that we take into account is a
weaker stiffness of the crust under tensional compared with compressional stress. This is mod-
eled by spring stiffnesses smaller in tension than in compression by the same asymmetry ratio
0 ≤ α = Kt/Kc ≤ 1 for all springs [46]. It is straightforward to show that isotropic elasticity
is recovered in the continuous limit in a pure compression mode (or in absence of nonlinearity for

2

α = 1) when diagonal spring stiffnesses are equal to half the horizontal and vertical bond spring
stiffnesses K [48], giving λ = µ = K/2 for the two Lam´e coefﬁcients, E = (4/3)K = (8/3)µ for
the Young modulus and ν = 1/3 for the Poisson coefﬁcient. We choosed Kc = 5 · 1014 N m−1 for
horizontal and vertical springs so that, as we consider a plate of thickness h = 10km, the 3D elastic
modulii used for our simulations are E = 6.25 · 1010 P a, µ = 2.5 · 1010 P a, and ν = 0.25, which
are close to usual modulii measured in experiments. Our calculations are performed on a lattice of
200 × 200 times the mesh, where one mesh size corresponds to 10 km. Quantitative measurements
are conﬁned in a range between 3 and 40 mesh sizes (30 − 400 km) to minimize discrete and ﬁnite
size effects.

The assumed double-couple [42] is discretized as a set of four forces of the same modulus
F applied on the four nodes of a unit cell as shown in Figure 1. Taking the cell size a = 10
km comparable to the seismogenic thickness and to the rupture length, and F = 7.1 · 1014N
corresponds to an event of scalar moment M0 = 7.1 · 1018 N m, i.e., of magnitude ≈ 6.5. We
impose zero displacements at the boundary of the plate of size L × L and the force ﬁeld created by
the double-couple is solved iteratively [49]. The stress tensor ﬁeld σij(x, y) is then calculated as in
[48].

Figure 1 (upper-left panel) shows the geometry of the double-couple deﬁning the earthquake and
the corresponding directions of the displacement calculated in a medium with asymmetric ratio α =
0.1. The ﬁrst striking result is that the square symmetry of the principal axes of the applied double-
couple is broken by the displacement ﬁeld, which exhibits an acute angle with the nodal planes. The
amplitude of the symmetry breaking is quantiﬁed by the angle θ deﬁned in Figure 1, which varies
as a function of α as shown in Figure 2 (right panel). The reason for this symmetry breaking is that
the double-couple deﬁnes two tensile and two compressive sectors. In the compressive sectors, the
elastic modulii are larger, leading to an ampliﬁcation of stress. This effect may have been observed
in the Manyi (M w = 7.6) earthquake [50]. Using SAR interferometry data, Peltzer et al. [50]
interpreted the mismatch between the displacement across each side of the left-lateral strike-slip
fault as due to a mechanical asymmetry between dilational and compressional quadrants. Using
a ﬁrst-order perturbative calculation, they estimated a coefﬁcient 1/4 ≤ α ≤ 1/2 to explain the
observed displacement asymmetry. The prediction of the angular mismatch θ obtained using our
full non-perturbative solution in Figures 1 and 2 offers a new method for the detection and the
calibration of a possible nonlinear elasticity by comparing the fault orientation with the principal
axes of the seismic tensor provided by the inversion of seismic waves [51].

Figure 1 also compares the spatial ﬁeld σxy for two values α = 0.5 and α = 0.1 with the linear
case α = 1. The lobes A, B, C and D (respectively E, F, G and H) have positive (respectively
negative) σxy. Lobes E and G (respectively F and H) are oriented along the compressive (re-
spectively extensive) sectors of the double-couple and are as a consequence ampliﬁed (respectively
attenuated) by the nonlinear elasticity considered here [52]. Notice that, as α decreases, lobes E
and G along the principal compressive direction have a stronger and stronger directivity, which is
reminiscent of the chain force effect in granular media [53]. This deﬁnes three classes of lobes:
1) A, B, C and D characterized by a positive shear stress; 2) E and G characterized by a negative
shear stress oriented along the compressive sectors of the double-couple; 3) F and H characterized
by a negative shear stress oriented along the tensile sectors of the double-couple.

Figure 3 quantiﬁes the decay of σxy with distance from the origin of the double-couple in
different lobes along their crests. For α = 1, we recover the standard power law decay ∝ 1/r2
with distance r. For α < 1, we ﬁnd also power law decays ∝ 1/rγ which are different in the three
different lobe classes with exponents γ(α) which decrease with α for lobes A − D and E, G, and

3

increases with α lobes F, H [54]. The dependence of γ(α) is shown in Figure 2 (left panel). Notice
that the maximum stress is approximately the same for all lobes and for all α’s very close to the
source with an amplitude of the order of 0.3 − 0.6 Mpa. At larger distances, the impact of α is
striking. For α = 0.1, the shear stress is 100 times larger at 100 rupture lengths than in the linear
elastic case in the lobe class A, B, C, D, for instance. If we assume that a stress increase of the
order of 0.1 bar (104 Pa) is sufﬁcient to trigger an event, then an earthquake could remotely trigger
another shock at a distance of about 8 times its rupture length in the linear case and at up to 40 times
its rupture length for α = 0.01. In the lobe class A, B, C, D, the exponent γ decreases sharply for
α ≤ 0.3 with γ(α = 0.1) = 1.33 and γ(α = 0.01) ≈ 0.8. In the lobe class E, G, γ decreases
similarly from a value close to 2 for α = 1 to γ(α = 0.01) = 1.22. The exponent γ for lobe class
E, G is not the same as in the case of lobe A, showing that both lobes are not exactly antithetic. The
behaviour of lobes F and H is more complex. The decay exponent ﬁrst increases as α decrease, up
to 4 for α = 0.4. But, at the same time, both lobes decrease in size, so that one can not measure any
reliable exponent for lower α values. For example, for α = 0.1, one clearly sees on Figure 1 that
both lobes (initially negative) have almost disappeared, and are replaced by slow varying positive
values that are indeed located on the edges of lobes A and D or B and C.

We also studied the azimutal variation of γ within each lobe and for different values of α. We
observed that γ was independent of azimut and lobe for α = 1, which is in agreement with the
standard prediction of linear elasticity. For α = 0.5, the γ exponent is stable with azimut in lobe
E, F, G, H. In lobes A, B, C and D, a strong variation is observed, as γ varies between 2 and
1.5. For α = 0.1, γ can’t be determined in lobes F and H. In lobes E and G, the exponent varies
from 1 on the edges to about 1.5 on its central, symmetry axis . In lobes A, B, C, and D, γ varies
between 0 to about 1.8 (in lobe A, γ continuously decreases clockwise, which can be anticipated
when looking at Figure 1).

These results highlight the long-range static mechanical transfer function induced by the simple
asymmetric nonlinear elasticity, which may be important for long-range triggering effects between
earthquakes. A full analysis of such long range triggering effect requires to take into account the
other stress components, the relevant friction laws and the lithostatic and pore pressure. This will
be shown in another report.

Our results open many interesting questions on the phenomenology of earthquakes that should
be re-analyzed with this new non-linear perspective. In future research, an important consequence
of our hypothesis of nonlinear elasticity is that stress ﬁeld perturbations due to successive earth-
quakes can not be simply added. Stress ﬁeld evolutions with time may have much sharper transi-
tions in space and time than predicted by models involving linear elasticity, a behaviour reminiscent
of the mechanics of granular media. These effects could be even stronger in mining-induced events
interactions, in laboratory damage mechanics experiments as well as in volcanoes containing many
cracks pressurized by cracks.

[21] It has been argued that rock permeability and thus microcracking adjusts itself, so that ﬂuid pressure is
always close to rock pressure irrespective of the extend of hydration/dehydration [22, 23]. One possible
mechanism for this involves a time-dependent process that relates ﬂuid pressure, ﬂow pathways and
ﬂuid volumes [24].

[25] Much attention has been devoted to the role of overpressurized ﬂuid [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. It is
more and more recognized that ﬂuids play an essential role in virtually all crustal processes. Ref.[32]
reviews the historical development of the conciousness among researchers of the ubiquitous presence
and importance of ﬂuids within the crust. Numerous examples exist that demonstrate water as an active
agent of the mechanical, chemical [33] and thermal processes that control many geologic processes
that operate within the crust [22]. The bulk of available information on the behavior of ﬂuids comes
from observations of exposed rocks that once resided at deeper crustal levels. In any case, present

5

day surface exposed metamorphic rocks indicate that, at all crustal levels, ﬂuids have been present
in signiﬁcant volume. Because the porosity of metamorphic rock is probably less than 1%, the high
volume of calculated ﬂuid necessary to produce observed chemical changes suggests that ﬂuid must
have been replenished thousands of times. It has also been proposed that gold-quartz vein ﬁelds in
metamorphic terranes provide evidence for the involvement of large volumes of ﬂuids during faulting
and may be the product of seismic processes [34]. Water is also released from transformed minerals.
For instance, Montmorillonite changes to illite with a release of free water from the clay structure at
approximately the same depth as the ﬁrst occurrence of the anomalous pore pressure [35]. This is the
most commonly discussed example of hydration and dehydration of minerals changing the ﬂuid mass
and the pore pressure. Fluids have been directly sampled at about 11 km by the Soviets at the Kola
Peninsula drillhole.

[36] Many observations suggest that there are massive crustal ﬂuid displacements correlated with seismic
events. Among them, one can cite the fault-valve mechanism [37] or the migration and diffusion of af-
tershocks [38]. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the mechanical effect of ﬂuids to decrease
compressive lithostatic stresses: mantle-derived source of ﬂuids can maintain overpressure within a
leaky fault (Rice, J.R., in [22]); laboratory sliding experiments on granite show that the sliding resis-
tance of shear planes can be signiﬁcantly decreased by pore sealing and compaction which prevent the
communication of ﬂuids between the porous deforming shear zone and the surrounding material [29].
Physico-chemical processes such as mineral dehydration during metamorphism may provide large ﬂuid
abundance over large areas [39, 40]. Such ﬂuid presence or migration implies that cracks may open and
close even at seismogenic depth, justifying the relevance of asymetric nonlinear elasticity for such
depths.

[41] Many crustal rocks have a Young’s modulus depending on conﬁning pressure, in particular with a
Young’s modulus in tension smaller than the Young’s modulus in compression in a ratio from 1/2 to
1/10 [43]. Nonlinear elasticity of rocks is also well-documented from its nonlinear wave signatures
[44].

[42] In the presence of asymmetric nonlinearity, an earthquake may not be anymore a pure double-couple
but may also present a dipole component corresponding to two opposite colinear forces of the same
amplitude (so that the total torque is zero). The double-couple and the colinear force dipole obey the
condition of mechanical equilibrium before and after the event as the total force and total torque ﬁelds
exerted by the earthquake vanish.

[46] This amounts to assuming a uniform and isotropic distribution of cracks with sizes smaller than the
representative mesh size. Real damage in the crust is of course much more complex, with anisotropic,
space and scale dependence. These complications are neglected in our ﬁrst exploration. We can obtain
an order of magnitude estimate of the density of ﬂuid-ﬁlled faults associated with a given asymmetric
coefﬁcient α = Kt/Kc, using the effective medium calculations in [47]. To simplify, less us assume
λ = µ, we have α = λ1/λd = 1/(1 + 5D/2), where λ1 is the Lam´e coefﬁcient of the damage material
and D = N (ℓ/L)3 is the density of faults (assumed identical) of radius ℓ in a cube of volume L3.
N is the number of faults in that volume. For instance, we need about 11 faults of size L/3 to get
α = 0.5. Such estimate must however be taken with caution since the effective medium calculation
α = 1/(1 + 5D/2) is valid only for small crack densities, while any piece of rock and the real crust are
crisscrossed by many faults at many length scales, most of them being healed at varying degrees. We
think that values of α signiﬁcantly smaller than 1 should thus not be excluded.

[49] We solve for the node displacements by an iterative relaxation method. During each iteration, all nodes
are sequentially considered. For each node, the total force exerted on it by all connected springs (plus
the possible external force) is computed, and the node is moved in the direction of the net force so as
to decrease its amplitude. We sweep the network alternatively from right to left and from left to right,
from top to bottom and from bottom to top. Upon iterating, the net force acting on any node decreases
until a threshold is reached and we stop the computation and consider the resulting displacement ﬁeld
as the correct equilibrium one. The threshold is chosen so that the displacement necessary to lower the
net force on a node becomes comparable to the numerical accuracy. We have veriﬁed that our results in
the scaling region of distances r larger than the mesh size a but no larger than L/5 are independent of
the boundary conditions and of the plate size L and are robust with respect to the choice of the arrest
criterion. Most of our calculations have been performed with L = 50a to 200a and we report our results
for L = 200a.

[51] The Manyi fault surface rupture has an average orientation N 76 − E. From Figure 1, for a left-lateral
strike-slip fault, we see that the closest dynamic nodal plane should be obtained from the geomet-
ric rupture plane by a anti-clockwise rotation. Three inversions of the focal mechanism of the Manyi
earthquake have been performed, which provide three dynamic planes close to the geometrical rupture
plane: Harvard CMT (with a plane oriented N 79 − E), Moscow (N 84 − E), and NEIC (N 70 − E). If
these rotations are genuine, the ﬁrst two planes correspond to clockwise rotations of the observed static
plane, which contradict our theory. In contrast, the NEIC solution ﬁnds a 6◦ clockwise rotation from
the rupture plane. Assuming this solution as the genuine one, this rotation corresponds to an asymmet-
ric ratio α = 0.5 as seen in Figure 2. This value is close to the rough estimate of Peltzer et al. [50]
obtained from independent data. While this is encouraging, this does not explain why the two other

7

solutions of Harvard CMT and Moscow disagree. Other problems may be due to the fact that the dy-
namical rupture mechanism is more complex and has occurred on a more complex geometry. Coupled
with possible nonlinear elasticity, this would considerably entangle the relationship between static and
dynamic planes. Additional effects include the free surface and the coupling with the lower crust.

[52] Lobes A, B, C and D exhibit a slight rotation as α is decreased. Lobes A and C rotate clockwise, while
lobes B and D rotate counter-clockwise as α decreases. The initial square geometry is thus broken by
the nonlinear elasticity but the shear stresses within these lobes remain approximately of the same
amplitudes. Lobes E, F , G and H exbibit a spatial structure which is not the symmetric of the lobes A,
B, C and D. Thus, not also is the square symmetry broken within the class of lobes of the same sign,
but it is also broken between the two families. As α decreases, lobes E and G widen while lobes F and
H become narrower. Moreover, the two couples of lobes remain orthogonal to each other for all values
of α. They still wear the ﬁngerprint of the tensile and compressive quadrants of the double-couple.

[54] Ref. [55] gives the analytical solution for the stress ﬁeld and for the dependence γ(α) in a nonlinear
asymmetric elastic medium in the case of antiplane mode III loading, which is thus the scalar equivalent
to the problem studied here. In the antiplane case, there is only one stress component and a single
exponent γ(α).

Figure 1: Distances are given in hundreds of kilometers. a) The continuous blue arrows show
the four forces (each of modulus F ) deﬁning the double-couple earthquake applied to the nodes
(green squares) of a single cell. This deﬁnes a positive shear stress σxy at the source. The orange
dashed-line arrows give the corresponding orientation of the displacement ﬁeld interpolated on the
vertical and the horizontal axes of the point-wise source (shown as a black circle), which deﬁne two
conjugate fault discontinuities shown as the two red thick solid and dashed lines, for an asymmetric
ratio α ≡ Kt/Kc = 0.1. Kt (respectively Kc) is the elastic modulus in tension (respectively
compression). The right-lateral discontinuity is shown as the red continuous line, while the left-
lateral discontinuity is shown as the red dashed line. The real fault plane should thus be along one
of those two lines. The cyan continuous arrows show the displacement directions interpolated at
the same locations as above, but in the linear case. The right-lateral and left-lateral nodal planes are
shown respectively as continuous and dashed thick blue lines. For α < 1, due to the asymmetric
nonlinear elasticity, the pair of fault discontinuities doesn’t match, as they are rotated by an angle
θ (clockwise for the left-lateral plane, anticlockwise for the right-lateral plane). b) σxy increment
due to the double-couple for α = 1. See a) for deﬁnition of red lines. Contour lines are spaced by
a factor 2. Red lobes are subjected to stress increase, blue lobes to stress drop. c) Same as b) for
α = 0.5. d) Same as b) for α = 0.1.

Figure 2: a) Dependance of the exponent γ with α. γ is the exponent of the power law describing
stress decrease as a function of distance. The red (respectively blue) curve is for lobes A, B, C, D
(respectively E, G); their scale is shown on the left vertical axis. The green curve is constructed
for lobes F, H, with scale on the right vertical axis. b) Dependence of the angle θ between the
geometrical displacement discontinuity and the nodal planes of the double-couple as a function of
the asymmetric ratio α.

Distance from the source (m)

Figure 3: Power law decrease in log − log scale of the shear stress σxy as a function of distance
from the earthquake source for different values of α (from 0.01 to 1 - see insert on top right for the
color code), measured on the crest of lobes A, B, C, D. Clear power law regimes can be observed
for distances between 40 km and 300 − 400 km. Deviations from a pure power law occur far from
the source (due to boundary effects) and close to the source (because of its ﬁnite size and of lattice
effects).

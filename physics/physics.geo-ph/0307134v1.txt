Intercluster Correlation in Seismicity

Mega et al.
[1] proposed to use the “diﬀusion entropy”
(DE) method to demonstrate that the distribution of
time intervals between a large earthquake (the main-
shock of a given seismic sequence) and the next one
does not obey Poisson statistics. We have re-analyzed
the same catalog of seismic events in California and per-
formed synthetic tests which show that the DE is un-
able to detect correlations between clusters, thus negat-
ing the claimed possibility of detecting an intercluster
correlation. We have generated synthetic earthquake cat-
alogs with a Poisson distribution of mainshock times,
with aftershocks triggered in direct lineage by each main-
shock following Omori’s power-law decay of seismic rate
n(t) ∝ 1/(t − ti)p (with p = 1, and where ti is the
mainshock time) and with a power law distribution of
aftershock cluster sizes with exponent b/α = 1.25 (justi-
ﬁed from the interplay between the power-law distribu-
tion of energies with exponent b = 1 (Gutenberg-Richter
law) and the power-law increase of aftershock produc-
tivity with the mainshock energy of exponent α = 0.8
[2]). Fig. 1 (crosses) shows that our synthetic DE with-
out intercluster correlation is essentially undistinguish-
able from the real data. Thus, the conclusion of Mega et
al. [1] that the clusters of seismicity are correlated is not
warranted by their analysis. However, the fact that inter-
cluster correlation exists is known at least since Kagan
and Jackson [3] and can be observed straightforwardly,
as shown in Fig. 2.

We have used the ETAS model to generate realistic
synthetic catalogs. The ETAS model is a simple branch-
ing model of seismicity [4] which contains the Gutenberg-
Richter, the Omori law, the productivity law, cascades of
multiple triggering between earthquakes and a poissonian
seismicity background. In the ETAS model, any earth-
quake may trigger other earthquakes, without arbitrary
distinction between foreshocks, aftershocks and main-
shocks. The ETAS model reproduces many properties of
seismicity, including realistic foreshock sequences [5]. It
is widely used to model and predict the spatio-temporal
distribution of seismicity (e.g., [4] and ref. 8 of [1]). As
shown in Figs. 1 and 2 (circles), the ETAS model recov-
ers (i) Mega et al.’s observation of DE S(t) = A + δ ln t
with δ = 0.94, (ii) the power-law pdf of the time in-
tervals τ [m] between two successive mainshocks (which
arises because many mainshocks are also aftershocks of
other mainshocks) and (iii) a correlation between τ [m]
’s
(which is absent in Mega et al.’s LR model). Thus, their
LR model, which introduces correlation between clusters
of seismicity, is insuﬃcient to account for the correlation
observed in the data.

We believe that these discrepancies with Mega et al.’s
conclusions stem for their incorrect use of the pdf of
intracluster interevent times tj+1 − tj. Omori’s law is
the pdf of the times between a mainshock and its af-
tershocks and describes a non-stationary process such

Therefore, the pdf of interevent times is not equivalent
to Omori’s law and it looses most of the information on
correlations between aftershocks. This work is supported

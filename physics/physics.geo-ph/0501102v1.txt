Abstract

Using the ETAS branching model of triggered seismicity, we apply the formalism of generating prob-

ability functions to calculate exactly the average diﬀerence between the magnitude of a mainshock and

the magnitude of its largest aftershock over all generations. This average magnitude diﬀerence is found

empirically to be independent of the mainshock magnitude and equal to 1.2, a universal behavior known

as B˚ath’s law. Our theory shows that B˚ath’s law holds only suﬃciently close to the critical regime of

the ETAS branching process. Allowing for error bars ±0.1 for B˚ath’s constant value around 1.2, our

exact analytical treatment of B˚ath’s law provides new constraints on the productivity exponent α and

the branching ratio n: 0.9 . α ≤ 1 and 0.8 . n ≤ 1. We propose a novel method for measuring α

based on the predicted renormalization of the Gutenberg-Richter distribution of the magnitudes of the

largest aftershock. We also introduce the “second B˚ath’s law for foreshocks: the probability that a main

earthquake turns out to be the foreshock does not depend on its magnitude ρ.

INTRODUCTION

This paper is part of our continuing eﬀort to develop a complete theory of seismicity within

models of triggered seismicity, which allows one to make quantitative predictions of observables

that can be compared with empirical data [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. We study the general branching process,

called the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model of triggered seismicity, introduced

by Ogata in the present form [7] and by Kagan and Knopoﬀ in a slightly diﬀerent form [8] and

whose main statistical properties are reviewed in [2]. The ETAS model belongs to a general class

of branching processes [9, 10], and has in addition the property that the variance of the number of

earthquake progenies triggered in direct lineage from a given mother earthquake is mathematically

inﬁnite. This model has been shown to constitute a powerful null hypothesis to test against

other models [7]. The advantage of the ETAS model is its conceptual simplicity based on three

independent well-found empirical laws (Gutenberg-Richter distribution of earthquake magnitudes,

Omori law of aftershocks and productivity law) and its power of explanation of other empirical

observations (see for instance [3] and references therein).

Here, we develop a theoretical formulation based on generating probability functions (GPF) to

construct the distribution of magnitudes of the largest triggered event (largest aftershock) within

the cascade comprising all triggered events of a given source earthquake. This allows us to derive

the empirical B˚ath’s law [11, 12], which states that the average diﬀerence in magnitude between

a mainshock and its largest aftershock is 1.2 regardless of the mainshock magnitude, within a

completely consistent theory taking into account all generations of triggered events. Our present

results signiﬁcantly improve on the numerical results of [12] by demonstrating the essential roles

played by the cascade of triggered events and the proximity to criticality in order to obtain B˚ath’s

law and by providing new improved constraints on the key parameters of the ETAS model. In

addition, we extend B˚ath’s law which is a statement on the average magnitude diﬀerence between

the mainshock and its largest aftershock by giving the full distribution. Our theoretical framework

also allows us to calculate precisely the probability that the largest aftershock turns out to be larger

than its source, a situation which is usually interpreted as the source and all events before the largest

aftershock being its foreshocks, the largest aftershock being re-interpreted as the mainshock of the

seismic series.

The paper is organized as follow. The next section 2 recalls the deﬁnition of the branching

2

model of triggered seismicity. Section 3 presents the generating probability function (GPF) and

results on the statistics of the largest aftershock among aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation. The

GPF for ﬁrst-generation aftershocks is generalized to aftershocks of all generations in section 4.

This allows us to predict that the distribution of magnitudes of the largest aftershock over all

aftershock generations is renormalized in the critical regime. This renormalization provides a novel

way to calibrate the productivity parameter. Section 5 puts together previous results to calculate

the average diﬀerence in magnitude between the mainshock and its largest aftershock over all

generation. In the critical regime, B˚ath’s law is shown to hold. The value of the average diﬀerence

in magnitude allows us to oﬀer new improved constraints on the two key parameters of the ETAS

model, the critical branching ratio n and the productivity exponent α. Section 6 concludes.

II. THE EPIDEMIC-TYPE AFTERSHOCK SEQUENCE (ETAS) BRANCHING

MODEL OF EARTHQUAKES

Consider an earthquake of magnitude ρ, which we refer to as a mainshock to mean that we

are interested in the earthquakes that it triggers (aftershocks). According to the ETAS model, it

generates a random number R1

ρ of ﬁrst generation aftershocks, which has Poissonian statistics,

characterized by the conditional average number

Pρ(R1

ρ) = e−κµ (µκ)R1
ρ)!

(R1

ρ

,

Nρ = κµ(ρ), µ(ρ) = 10α(ρ−m0) .

(1)

(2)

Here m0 is the minimum magnitude of earthquake capable of triggering other earthquakes, and κ

is a constant. The expression (2) for µ(ρ) is chosen in such a way that it reproduces the empirical

dependence of the average number of aftershocks triggered directly by an earthquake of magnitude

m (see [13, 14] and references therein). Expression (2) gives the so-called productivity law of a

given mother as a function of its magnitude ρ.

The ETAS model requires the speciﬁcation of the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) density distribution

of earthquake magnitudes

p(m) = b ln(10) 10−b(m−m0) , m > m0 ,

(3)

3

such that

∞
m p(x)dx gives the probability that an earthquake has a magnitude equal to or larger
R
than m. This magnitude distribution p(m) is assumed to be independent of the magnitude of the

triggering earthquake, i.e., a large earthquake can be triggered by a smaller one [3]. The cumulative

(P(m)) and complementary cumulative (Q(m)) distributions corresponding to (3) are

P(m) = 1 − Q(m), Q(m) = 10−b(m−m0) = [µ(m)]−γ ,

γ = b/α .

(4)

The ETAS model is deﬁned by the conditional Poisson intensity given the average rate of

seismicity at time t and position r conditioned on all past earthquakes

λ(t, r) = s(t, r) +

µ(mi) Ψ(t − ti) φ(r − ri) ,

(5)

Xi | ti≤t

where s(t, r) is the average Poisson rate of spontaneous earthquake sources (“immigrants” in the

language of epidemic branching processes) at position r and at time t. The sum is over all past

earthquakes: each earthquake is characterized by its occurrence time ti, its magnitude mi and its

location ri in the catalog. The two kernels Ψ(t − ti) and φ(r − ri), whose integrals with respect

to time and space respectively are normalized to 1, describe the contribution of the earthquake at

time ti and position ri to the seismic intensity at time t in the future and at position r.

III. STATISTICS OF THE LARGEST AFTERSHOCK AMONG AFTERSHOCKS OF

THE FIRST GENERATION

by an arbitrary mainshock

A. Generating probability function (GPF) of aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation triggered

The Poissonian statistics of the aftershocks of ﬁrst generation implies that the generating prob-

ability function (GPF) of their numbers reads

Θ1(z|ρ) = hzR1

ρi =

Pρ(r)zr = eκµ(ρ)(z−1) ,

∞

Xr=0
where we have used (1) and the angle brackets correspond to taking the statistical averaging.

Let M1, M2, . . . MR1

ρ be the random magnitudes of the R1

ρ aftershocks of ﬁrst generation triggered

by the mainshock. Let us consider the statistical average deﬁned by

(6)

(7)

Θ1(z, m|ρ) = hzR1

ρ

H(m − Mk)i ,

R1
ρ

Yk=1

4

where H is the Heaviside function. Using the Poissonian statistics of the random number R1

aftershock numbers and the Gutenberg-Richter law for their magnitudes, we obtain

Θ1(z, m|ρ) =

Pρ(r)zr[P(m)]r = eκµ[zP(m)−1].

∞

Xr=0
Notice that Θ1(z, m|ρ) can be rewritten as

Θ1(z, m|ρ) = hzR1

ρ(m)H(m − M 1

ρ )i ,

where M 1

ρ is the largest magnitude over all aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation triggered by the

mainshock and R1

ρ(m) is the number of aftershocks for those realizations of aftershocks in which

no aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation exceed the magnitude m.

The interest in Θ1(z, m|ρ) in (8,9) lies in particular in the fact that, for z = 1, it reduces to

the probability P1(m|ρ) that the largest magnitude among all aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation is

smaller than m:

P1(m|ρ) = Θ1(z = 1, m|ρ) = Pr {M 1

ρ < m} = e−κµ(ρ)Q(m) .

(10)

B. GPF of aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation triggered by a spontaneous source

Consider now some spontaneous source (contributing to the term s(t, r) in (5)), with magnitude

M0. According to the ETAS model, it triggers its own aftershocks sequence independently of all

other sequences. Let

M0, M1, M2, . . . MR1

be the random sequence of magnitudes (including M0) of the ﬁrst generation aftershocks triggered

by the spontaneous source. Then, analogously to (8), the GPF

Θ1(z, m) = hzR1(m)H(m − M 1)i ,

describing the statistics of the number R1(m) of aftershocks of ﬁrst generation (triggered by the

spontaneous source) and their largest magnitude M 1 among the list (11), is equal to

Θ1(z, m) = F [1 − zP(m)] − [µ(m)]−γF (µ(m)[1 − zP(m)]) ,

(14)

where

F (y) = γκγyγΓ(−γ, κy) .

For m → ∞, the GPF Θ1(z, m) given by (13) reduces to the standard GPF of the random number

R1 of aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation triggered by some spontaneous source, which reads

Θ1(z) = Θ1(z, m = ∞) = F (1 − z) .

(15)

In the following analysis, the function F (y) in (14) plays a crucial role.

It is thus useful to

state some of its analytical properties. For 1 < γ . 1.5 and y . 0.2, it can be represented rather

accurately by

F (y) ≃ 1 − n y + β yγ,

β = −

(16)

In the theory of aftershocks branching processes, the branching ratio, equal to the average

number of ﬁrst generation aftershocks triggered by some mother earthquake, plays a fundamental

role since it controls the subcriticality versus supercriticality of the process. It is deﬁned as

Thus, for given b, α and n, the constant κ in relations (8) and (10) can be replaced by

Taking z = 1 in (13) obtains the cumulative distribution function (CDF) P1(m) of the largest

magnitude M 1 among the sequence (11) of aftershocks including their spontaneous source

The GPF Θ1(z, m) in (13) describes the statistics of the spontaneous source and its ﬁrst gen-

eration aftershocks, such that all magnitudes, including the magnitude of the spontaneous source,

are smaller than m. In the following, we will consider the possibility that the largest aftershock

may be larger than the source, a situation which is known in the seismological literature as the

occurrence of foreshocks (see [3, 15, 16] and references therein). The corresponding GPF, averaged
over all possible foreshock’s magnitudes, is denoted as ¯θ1(z, m) and is obtained formally from (13)

by taking the limit µ → ∞:

¯θ1(z, m) = F [1 − zP(m)] .

(20)

C. Magnitude of the largest aftershock of the ﬁrst generation aftershocks

Before analyzing the conditions under which the empirical B˚ath’s law can be obtained from the

ETAS model, it is useful to ask what is its analog when restricting the set of aftershocks to the

ﬁrst generation of events triggered by the source. This will provide a reference point against which

to gauge the impact of the multiple generations of aftershocks on B˚ath’s law.

We start from expression (10) giving the CDF P1(m|ρ) of the largest magnitude M 1

ρ among all

aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation. Substituting (2,4) in (10), we obtain

P1(m|ρ) = G[w0(m − ρ + v0)] ,

where

is the well-known limiting extremal Gumbel CDF.

It follows from (21) in particular that the probability density function (PDF) of the diﬀerence

G(x) = exp

−e−x

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

∆1

ρ = ρ − M 1
ρ

between the source (mainshock) magnitude and the magnitude of its largest aftershock of the ﬁrst

generation is equal to

where

f1(δ|ρ) = w0 g[w0(v0 − δ)] ,

g(x) = exp(−x − e−x)

(21)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

is the PDF associated with the CDF (23). Note that the shape and variance of the PDF (25)

does not depend on the mainshock magnitude ρ. Only its mode v0(ρ) (most probable value of the

diﬀerence (24)) depends on ρ and increases linearly with it according to (22).

These results treat all aftershock sequences on the same footing and in particular include se-

quences which have zero aftershocks.

In a real data analysis, the statistical properties of the

diﬀerence (24) are obtained conditioned on the observation of at least one aftershock, which re-

quires a modiﬁcation of the expressions above. We are interested in modifying the CDF (10) to

7

eliminate the cases where R1

ρ = 0. This corresponds to obtaining the CDF of the largest magni-

tude of ﬁrst generation aftershocks under the condition that the mainshock triggers at least one

(27)

(28)

(29)

aftershock:

P1(m|ρ; 1) = 1 − Q1(m|ρ; 1), Q1(m|ρ; 1) =

1 − e−κµ(ρ)Q(m)
1 − e−κµ(ρ)

.

The corresponding PDF of the diﬀerence (24) reads

f1(δ|ρ) = w0

g[w0(v0 − δ)]
1 − e−κµ(ρ)

,

−∞ < δ < ρ − m0 .

The conditional CDF (27) diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the unconditional one (10) only if the probability

e−κµ(ρ) that there are no aftershocks is close to 1. This occurs for small mainshock magnitudes.

How small should the mainshocks be for this diﬀerence to be important? Let us deﬁne a magnitude

threshold ρ0 by

κµ(ρ) ≃ 2

⇒

ρ0 = m0 +

log10

1
α

2b
n(b − α) !

 

.

For mainshock magnitudes ρ > ρ0, the conditional CDF (27) does not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from

the unconditional one (10). In this case, relations (25) and (28) are approximately equal, and the

looked for distribution of the diﬀerence (24) can be taken to be the PDF (25) where δ ∈ (−∞, ∞).

Thus, for ρ > ρ0, the average of the magnitude diﬀerence (24) can be approximated by

where ν ≃ 0.5772 is the Euler constant. Figure 1 shows the exact average diﬀerence ∆1

ρm calculated
with (28), its approximation (30) valid for suﬃciently large mainshocks ρ > ρ0 and the most

probable value ∆1

ρm∗ = v0(ρ) of the diﬀerence in magnitude between the mainshock magnitude ρ

and its largest aftershock. This ﬁgure is typical of the strong dependence found for all reasonable

values of the parameters and distinguishes this result from the empirical B˚ath’s law (which gives

a constant value independent of ρ).

IV. STATISTICS OF THE LARGEST AFTERSHOCK AMONG AFTERSHOCKS OF

ALL GENERATIONS

A. GPF of the aftershocks over all generations triggered by a spontaneous source

Due to the mutual statistical independence of diﬀerent branches of triggered earthquakes in the

ETAS model, one can easily generalize the results for the largest aftershock of the ﬁrst generation

8

to derive the statistical properties of the largest aftershock over all generations.

Within the ETAS branching model, taking into account all aftershocks of all generations which

are triggered by the mainshock amounts to replacing in the r.h.s. of equation (8) the PDF P(m)

of the magnitudes of single aftershocks by the GPF Θ(z, m) for all aftershocks triggered by some

spontaneous source which have (together with the source) magnitudes smaller than m. As a result,

we obtain the sought GPF of the number of all aftershocks triggered by the mainshock conditioned

on all magnitudes to be less than m as

Θ(z, m|ρ) = hzRρ(m) H(m − Mρ)i = eκµ(ρ)[zΘ(z,m)−1] .

Here, Mρ is the magnitude of the largest aftershock. In particular, the complementary CDF of the

magnitude of the largest aftershock reads

Q(m|ρ) = hH(Mρ − m)i = 1 − e−κµ(ρ)Q(m) .

Similarly, the functional equation for the GPF Θ(z, m) is obtained by replacing in (13) both Θ1

and P(m) by Θ(z, m):

Θ(z, m) = F (1 − zΘ(z, m)) − µ−γ(m)F [µ(m)(1 − zΘ(z, m))] .

(33)

For z = 1, equation (33) reduces to an equation for the CDF P (m) of the magnitude M of the

largest event (including all aftershocks and the source) deﬁned as

Θ(z = 1, m) = P (m) = Pr {M < m} .

This equation reads

P = F (Q) − µ−γF (µQ),

Q(m) = 1 − P (m) .

Notice that in the limit m → ∞, Eq. (33) reduces to the well-known functional equation

for the standard GPF

[4, 6].

Θ = Θ1(zΘ)

Θ(z, m = ∞) = Θ(z) = hzRi

9

of the random number R of all aftershocks triggered by some ancestor, which has been studied in

(31)

(32)

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

Similarly to the reasoning leading to (27), the conditional probability that the magnitude of

the largest aftershock exceeds m, under the condition that the mainshock triggers at least one

aftershock, is

Q(m|ρ; 1) =

1 − e−κµ(ρ)Q(m)
1 − e−κµ(ρ)

,

Q(m) = 1 − P (m) .

(38)

It is also of interest to obtain the GPF ¯Θ(z, m) of the number of aftershocks of all generations

with magnitudes smaller than m which are triggered by some spontaneous source of arbitrary

magnitude. It is given by replacing in the r.h.s. of Eq. (20) P(m) by the GPF Θ(z, m) given by

(33) which yields

¯Θ(z, m) = F [1 − zΘ(z, m)] .

For z = 1, this gives the probability ¯P (m) that the magnitude of the largest aftershock triggered

by an arbitrary spontaneous source is smaller than m:

¯P (m) = F [Q(m)] .

B. Distribution of the magnitude of the largest aftershock of a spontaneous earthquake

source of arbitrary magnitude

All quantities deﬁned above require the knowledge of Q(m), which has a straightforward sta-

tistical meaning:

it is the complementary CDF of the magnitude of the largest aftershock of a

spontaneous source of arbitrary magnitude (in other words, over all possible source magnitudes).

It is easy to calculate Q(m) by solving equation (35) numerically. We can also use the algebraic

approximation (16) of the function F (y) to obtain an explicit and rather precise analytic expression

of Q(m). Indeed, substituting (16) into (35) obtains

Q(m) ≃

1
(1 − n)[µ(m)]γ + nµ(m)

.

This expression shows that there is a cross-over magnitude mc, given by

µ(mc) ≃

1/(γ−1)

(cid:18)

⇒ mc ≃ m0 +

separating two regimes with diﬀerent power laws for Q(m). The ﬁrst regime

corresponds to a complementary CDF decaying slower than the Gutenberg-Richter law (3,4), for

α < b. In the critical case n = 1, mc = ∞ and this regime (43) holds for any m > m0. The second

regime recovers the Gutenberg-Richter law

Q(m) ≃

10−b(m−m0),

m & mc .

(44)

1
1 − n

Figure 2 shows the logarithm (in base 10) of the complementary CDF Q(m) as a function of m−m0

and the two power law asymptotics (42) and (43). We have thus shown that the Gutenberg-Richter

law can be renormalized from a bare exponent b to a smaller exponent α when the distribution

is restricted to the set of largest aftershocks of spontaneous earthquakes of arbitrary magnitudes.

This renormalization of the b-value from b to α is intrinsically a cascade phenomenon. In other

words, it results from the existence of a cascade of triggered earthquakes over many generations

as shown in details in [4]. This renormalization proceeds by a mechanism similar to that of the

p-value of the Omori law from a value 1 + θ to 1 − θ [1, 2]. It is diﬀerent from the mechanism

leading to an exponent b − α for the asymptotic branch of the Gutenberg-Richter distribution of

all foreshocks [16].

This prediction (43) oﬀers a novel method for measuring the key exponent α controlling the

productivity or triggering eﬃciency of earthquakes as a function of their magnitude, according

to (2). What is needed to implement this new method is a declustering technique to identify the

spontaneous sources and their largest aftershocks. The statistical declustering technique of Zhuang

et al. [17, 18] seems to be particularly suitable for this purpose.

Due to the independence between the aftershock sequences of diﬀerent sources in the ETAS

model, it is straightforward to obtain the probability distribution of the largest triggered events

among a set of r spontaneous sources. The corresponding complementary CDF, giving the prob-

ability that the largest event triggered over all generations by r sources is larger than m, is equal

to

¯Q(m|r) = 1 − F r[Q(m)] .

(45)

Figure 3 plots ¯Q(m|r) as a function of m − m0, for r running from 1 to 15 for α = 0.8, b = 1

and for two values of n, n = 0.9 and n = 1. It is clear that most of the largest triggered events

in aftershock sequences are very small, simply due to the interplay of two factors: most random

sources are themselves small and have a small productivity, and the Gutenberg-Richter distribution

makes it much more probable that all triggered events have small magnitudes.

11

C. Distribution of the magnitude of the largest aftershock of a spontaneous earthquake

source of ﬁxed magnitude ρ

Rather than considering arbitrary source magnitudes, it is interesting to determine the comple-

mentary CDF Q(m|ρ, r) of the magnitude of the largest event triggered by r spontaneous sources

with ﬁxed magnitudes ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρr. It is closely approximated by

In the following, we restrict our analysis to the case of a single r = 1 spontaneous source which

ﬁxed magnitude ρ. In this case, expression (46) transforms into (32).

For m < mc, where the cross-over magnitude mc is deﬁned by (42), expression (32) can be

simpliﬁed by replacing the exact Q(m) by the approximation (43), which gives

For m > mc, we obtain another approximation for Q(m|ρ) by replacing in the r.h.s. of equation

Figures 4 and 5 present the dependence of the complementary CDF Q(m|ρ) as a function of the

magnitude of the largest event triggered by a spontaneous source of ﬁxed magnitude ρ, for four

diﬀerent values of ρ. The ﬁgures show the exact Q(m|ρ) obtained numerically, its approximation

(52) (which is actually undistinguishable from the exact one) and the universal approximation

(47). The comparison between Figure 4 (for α = 0.8) and Figure 5 (for α = 0.9) shows that the

approximation (47) becomes more and more precise as α becomes closer to b.

As a bonus, we obtain the probability Q∗(ρ) that the magnitude m of the largest aftershock

exceeds the source magnitude ρ, a situation which is usually classiﬁed in seismic catalogs by saying

that the largest triggered event is the mainshock and the spontaneous source that initiated the

sequence and all triggered events before the largest aftershock are foreshocks.

Indeed, Q∗(ρ) is

nothing but

Q∗(ρ) ≡ Q(ρ|ρ; 1) .

Interestingly, in the regime m0 < ρ < mc (i.e., for n suﬃciently close to 1 and/or α close to b) for

which (47) holds, we obtain

Q∗(ρ) ≃ const = Q∗ = 1 − exp

α − b

 

b !

,

which is independent of ρ and of the branching ratio n. This approximation is all the better, the

closer α is to b. Figure 6 shows the exact Q∗(ρ) as a function of ρ, which can be compared with

the constant (54). One can observe that, at least for α = 0.95, Q∗(ρ) is actually quite close to

the constant (54) over all possible magnitudes ρ > m0. We propose to call the prediction (54)

the “second B˚ath’s law for foreshocks: the probability that a main earthquake turns out to be the

foreshock does not depend on its magnitude ρ (more generally, the distribution of the diﬀerence

ρ − m does not depend on ρ).

V. DERIVATION OF B˚ATH’S LAW

The derivation of the distribution (38) and the approximations (47) and (50) allow us to derive

B˚ath’s law by calculating the statistical average

∆ρm = ρ − hMρi ,

(55)

where Mρ denotes the magnitude of the largest aftershock among all events of all generations

triggered by the source of ﬁxed magnitude ρ. Recall that B˚ath’s law states that ∆ρm is independent

of ρ and equal to 1.2.

Within the ETAS model, the exact value of ∆ρm is obtained as

∆ρm = ρ −

Q(m|ρ; 1)dm

(56)

∞

m0

Z

where Q(m|ρ; 1) is given by (38) and the r.h.s. of (56) expresses the fact that the average is

performed over sequences with at least one aftershock.

The two regimes m < mc giving the asymptotic (47) and m > mc giving the asymptotic (50)

provides two asymptotic expressions for ∆ρm. Indeed, calculating hMρi using the approximation

(47) and neglecting the boundary eﬀects (i.e., supposing that m ∈ (−∞, ∞)) obtains

∆ρm1 ≃ v1 −

(57)

which is independent of ρ. Recall that ν ≃ 0.5772 is Euler constant. In the following, we call B

deﬁned in (57) the B˚ath’s constant. Note that this regime m < mc corresponds to the critical

branching regime of n close to 1 (for a ﬁxed magnitude ρ) and expresses the full eﬀect of the

cascade of triggered events over all possible generations. It is remarkable that the theory of the

ETAS branching model predicts the ﬁrst part of B˚ath’s law that the average of the diﬀerence

between the magnitude of a mainshock and its largest aftershock is independent of the mainshock

magnitude. The speciﬁc value of B˚ath’s constant B depends only two parameters, the b-value of

Gutenberg-Richter distribution and the productivity exponent α.

The second asymptotic for m > mc corresponds to using (50) to estimate hMρi, which yields

∆ρm2 ≃ v2 −

(58)

Note that ∆ρm2 is increasing with ρ as in expression (30) corresponding to taking only into account

aftershocks of the ﬁrst generation. This is natural since the asymptotic for m > mc corresponds to

14

n relatively far from 1 (for a ﬁxed ρ), i.e., far from the critical branching regime, such that only a

few generations play a signiﬁcant role in the population of aftershocks. This asymptotic (58) is also

identical to the expression (5) of [12] derived by using the statistical average of the total number

Naft of aftershocks of all generations triggered by a source of ﬁxed given magnitude. Thus, the

diﬀerence between this approximation (58) (and expression (5) of [12]) and the exact expression

(56) and its critical universal asymptotic (57) can be traced back to the diﬀerence between the

following two kinds of averages: hln[Naft]i and lnhNafti.

Figures 7 and 8 show the exact average magnitude diﬀerence (56) as a function of the mainshock

magnitude ρ for b = 1 and diﬀerent values of the branching ratio n, for α = 0.9 (Figure 7) and

α = 0.95 (Figure 8). As expected from the condition m < mc or n closer to 1 at ﬁxed ρ so that

mc is all the larger according to (42), the largest values of n give almost constant values of ∆ρm

in agreement with the prediction (57). For smaller n’s, we can observe a slow cross-over to the

second asymptotic (58). By comparison between Figure 7 and Figure 8, it is clear that low values

of α are not compatible with B˚ath’s law. As conﬁrmed with similar ﬁgures obtained for smaller

α’s, a value of α at least equal to 0.9 seems necessary to obtain a dependence of ∆ρm roughly

independent of ρ over a large magnitude range. This bound is compatible with some previous

studies [13, 14, 19] but in disagreement with others [18, 20]. But, we should remark that such

heterogeneity in reported values of key parameters of the ETAS model such as the productivity

exponent α could be due to the bias resulting from imperfect account of unobserved seismicity

below the completeness threshold, which may play a dominant role as explained in [21, 22]. Figure

8 also shows that, the closer n is to 1, the more independent is ∆ρm with respect to the mainshock

magnitude ρ. But, due to inherent ﬂuctuations in empirical data, n can be as low as n = 0.8 for

α ≃ 0.95 and ∆ρm would still be slowly growing between 1.1 and 1.3 over a large magnitude range

of ρ, so that B˚ath’s law would be approximately veriﬁed.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Using the ETAS branching model of triggered seismicity, we have shown how to calculate exactly

the average diﬀerence between the magnitude of a mainshock and the magnitude of its largest

aftershock over all generations. This average magnitude diﬀerence is found empirically to be

independent of the mainshock magnitude and equal to 1.2, a universal behavior known as B˚ath’s

15

law. We have developed the mathematical formulation in terms of generating probability functions

which allow us to obtain exact equations and useful approximations to understand the physical

basis for B˚ath’s law. In particular, we ﬁnd that the constancy of the average magnitude diﬀerence

(to a value that we term B˚ath’s constant) is associated with the critical regime of the ETAS

branching process. Allowing for error bars ±0.1 for B˚ath’s constant value around 1.2, our exact

analytical treatment of B˚ath’s law provides a new constraint on two key parameters of the ETAS

model, namely the productivity exponent α and the branching ratio n: α & 0.9 and n & 0.8.

We have suggested a novel method for measuring α based on the predicted renormalization of the

Gutenberg-Richter distribution of the magnitudes of the largest aftershock. To implement this

method, statistical declustering techniques can be used to identify the spontaneous sources and

their largest aftershocks. We have also proposed the “second B˚ath’s law for foreshocks” that the

probability that a main earthquake turns out to be the foreshock does not depend on its magnitude

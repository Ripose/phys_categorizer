In textbooks of geophysical ﬂuid dynamics, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force in a ro-
tating ﬂuid system are derived by making use of the ﬂuid parcel concept.
In contrast to this
intuitive derivation to the apparent forces, more rigorous derivation would be useful not only for
the pedagogical purpose, but also for the applications to other kinds of rotating geophysical sys-
tems rather than the ﬂuid. The purpose of this paper is to show a general procedure to derive the
transformed equations in the rotating frame of reference based on the local Galilean transformation
and rotational coordinate transformation of ﬁeld quantities. The generality and usefulness of this
Eulerian approach is demonstrated in the derivation of apparent forces in rotating ﬂuids as well as
the transformed electromagnetic ﬁeld equation in the rotating system.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In textbooks of geophysical ﬂuid dynamics [2, 3, 5, 6] and educational web sites [4], the apparent forces—the
Coriolis force and the centrifugal force—are derived with the help of the framework of classical mechanics of a point
particle; it is ﬁrst shown that the time derivative of a vector A is written as (dA/dt)I = (dA/dt)R + Ω × A, where Ω
is a constant angular velocity of the rotating frame of reference; I and R stand for the inertial and rotating frames,
respectively. The above relation for vector A is applied to a ﬂuid parcel’s position r and then to its velocity u, leading
to the relation

(duI /dt)I = (duR/dt)R + 2Ω × uR + Ω × (Ω × r).

(1)

Assuming that (duI /dt)I equals to the local force acting per unit mass on a ﬂuid parcel, the apparent forces in the
rotating frame are derived.

The above derivation can be called as a Lagrangian approach since it exploits the concept of the ﬂuid parcel. This
Lagrangian derivation seems to be a standard style not only in the ﬁeld of geophysical ﬂuid dynamics, but also in
more general ﬂuid dynamics [1].

The conventional Lagrangian derivation is ingenious and simple enough for introductory courses. But, why do
we have to use the (Lagrangian) ﬂuid parcel concept when we just want to derive the (Eulerian) ﬁeld equation in
the rotating frame? It should be possible to derive the apparent forces by a straightforward, rotating coordinate
transformation of ﬁeld quantities and the equation. The purpose of this paper is to introduce such an Eulerian
derivation of the apparent forces that can be contrasted with the conventional Lagrangian derivation.

There are three advantages of the Eulerian approach shown in this paper compared to the conventional Lagrangian
approach. Firstly, it is general. The Eulerian transformation is derived for any vector ﬁeld [eqs. (16) and (28)].
Therefore, in addition to the ﬂuid system, it can be used to derive, for example, the Maxwell’s equations in a rotating
frame of reference in which the ﬂuid parcel concept is invalid. (The Lagrangian approach does not work unless one
could deﬁne proper working Lagrangian vector like A for the electromagnetic ﬁeld.)

Secondly, physical meaning of the Eulerian derivation is clear. The Eulerian transformation of a vector ﬁeld
is composed of the local Galilean transformation and rotational transformation, as we will see in eq. (16). The
transformation of the time derivative of a vector ﬁeld [shown in eq. (28)] is also described by the local Galileain
transformation and rotational transformation.

Thirdly, it is mathematically rigorous. The key of the simplicity of the conventional Lagrangian derivation is eq. (1).
But note that the expression of du/dt is actually an abbreviated form, when it is ﬁnally applied to the ﬂuid equation,
of rather complicated terms; ∂u/∂t + (u · ∇)u. Note that the second term is nonlinear of u.
If one substitutes
(duI /dt)I = ∂uI /∂t + (uI · ∇I )uI , and (duR/dt)R = ∂uR/∂t + (uR · ∇R)uR, into the left-hand and right-hand sides
of eq. (1), respectively, the covered complexity of the equation becomes apparent that requires a mathematical proof.

In our opinion, the conventional Lagrangian derivation of the apparent forces is intuitive and simple, while the
Eulerian derivation shown here is rigorous and straightforward. These two derivations would be regarded as a com-
plemental approaches to the understanding of the apparent forces including the Coriolis force.

The authors could not ﬁnd the Eulerian derivation of this kind in textbooks on ﬂuid and geophysical ﬂuid dynamics.

II. VECTOR FIELD IN ROTATING FRAME OF REFERENCE

In order to derive general expression of a vector ﬁeld in a rotating frame of reference, we start from the Galilean
I be inertial frames with relative velocity

transformation of a vector ﬁeld between two inertial frames. Let LI and L′
V;

where x and x′ are coordinates in LI and L′
in L′

I as

I, respectively. When a vector ﬁeld v(x, t) is deﬁned in LI , it is observed

where GV is a Galilean transformation tensor. For example, the transformation of a ﬂuid ﬂow u(x, t) is given by

Other examples of the Galilean transformation tensor GV are for the magnetic ﬁeld B and the electric ﬁeld E;

x′ = x − Vt,

v′(x′, t) = G

V v(x, t),

u′(x′, t) = G

V u(x, t) ≡ u(x, t) − V.

B′(x′, t) = G

V B(x, t) ≡ B(x, t),

When a vector ﬁeld F is a function of a vector ﬁeld v, F = F(v), its transformation is given by

E′(x′, t) = G

V E(x, t) ≡ E(x, t) + V × B(x, t).

F′ = G

V F(v, t) ≡ F(G

Vv, t).

For example, when F = (u · ∇)u,

v
(u′ · ∇′)u′ = G

(u · ∇)u ≡ [(u(x, t) − V) · ∇](u(x, t) − V).

Let ˆLR be a rotating frame of reference with constant angular velocity Ω with respect to LI. For simplicity, we
suppose that ˆLR and LI share the same origin and z axis, and ˆLR is rotating around the z axis; Ω = (0, 0, ω). The
coordinates x and ˆx of a point observed in LI and ˆLR are related as

where Rωt denotes the rotational transformation with matrix expression

ˆx = Rωtx,

Rωt = 


sin ωt 0
cos ωt
− sin ωt cos ωt 0
1

0

0

.





Suppose a point P at coordinates ˆx that is ﬁxed in the rotating frame ˆLR. The point P is observed as a circular
trajectory in LI . Let xt and xt+∆t be two positions of P in the inertial frame LI at two successive time steps t and
t + ∆t. Equation (9) reads

Since the inverse transformation of the rotation Rω∆t is R−ω∆t, we obtain

ˆx = Rω(t+∆t)xt+∆t = Rωtxt.

xt+∆t = R−ω∆txt.

By expanding eq. (12) with respect to ∆t and ignoring O[(∆t)2], we get

xt+∆t = xt + ∆tΩ × xt.

Eq. (13) means that the point P at position x at time t is moving with instantaneous velocity Ω × x.

Suppose a vector ﬁeld a(x, t) deﬁned in the inertial frame LI . If another inertial frame L′

P with velocity Ω × xP , where xP is the P ’s coordinates in LI , then the vector observed in L′
(instantaneous) Galilean transformation [eq. (3)], as

I is co-moving with point
I is described by

a′(x′

P , t) = G

Va(xP , t), with V = Ω × xP .

The relation between the vector components of a′(x′
the same rotation matrix Rωt appeared in eq. (9);

P , t) in L′

I and ˆa(ˆxP , t) in the rotating frame ˆLR are related by

Applying the above local Galilean transformation for the speciﬁc point P to every position ˆx in ˆLR, we obtain

ˆa(ˆxP , t) = RωtG

Va(xP , t).

ˆa(ˆx, t) = R

For example, from eq. (4), the ﬂuid ﬂow u(x, t) in LI is transformed into ˆu(ˆx, t) in ˆLR as

ˆu(ˆx, t) = Rωt {u(x, t) − Ω × x} = Rωt {u(x, t) + x × Ω} .

Similarly, from eqs. (5) and (6), we obtain the transformation formulae for the magnetic ﬁeld and the electric ﬁeld:

To derive the ﬂuid equation in the rotating frame ˆLR, we need to calculate the transformation of the ﬂow’s nonlinear

and

term (u · ∇)u;

ˆB(ˆx, t) = Rωt B(x, t),

ˆE(ˆx, t) = Rωt {E(x, t) + (Ω × x) × B} .

= Rωt[{(u + x × Ω) · ∇}u + (u + x × Ω) × Ω]

[cf. (21)]
[(u · ∇)u + {(x × Ω) · ∇}u + u × Ω + (x × Ω) × Ω].

[cf. eq. (8)]

ωt

Here, we have used the following equation for any vector a

(a · ∇)(x × Ω) = a × Ω,

with a = u + x × Ω.
F = F(v, t), is given from eq. (7) as

In general, the transformation of a vector ﬁeld F that is a function of the vector ﬁeld v,

ˆF(ˆv, t) = Rωt G

Ω×x F(v, t) = Rωt F(G

Ω×x v, t).

Next step is to derive the transformation of the time derivative of a vector ﬁeld, ∂ˆa(ˆx, t)/∂t, where the partial

derivative should be taken with ﬁxed coordinates ˆx in the rotating frame of reference ˆLR:

where, from eq. (16),

we get

Here we used x instead of xt, for brevity. This is the general transformation formula for time derivative of vector ﬁeld
a between LI and ˆLR.

A special case of eq. (28) is given when the vector ﬁeld a is Galilean invariant, i.e., G = 1, such as the magnetic

ﬁeld B [see eq. (5)];

∂ ˆB
∂t

∂
∂t

(ˆx, t) = Rωt [

The transformation of the ﬂuid ﬂow u(x, t) between LI and ˆLR is obtained by substituting the Galilean transfor-

mation tensor GV for u deﬁned in eq. (4) into eq. (28);

where we have used eq. (21) with a = Ω × x. It is interesting that the transformation rule of the ﬂuid ﬂow u is exactly
the same as that of the magnetic ﬁeld B although u is not a Galilean invariant vector.

III. TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION

The Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible ﬂuid in the inertial frame LI is written as

where f ≡ −∇p + ν∇2u with viscosity ν. The pressure gradient term ∇p is Galilean invariant vector, and another
term in the total force f is transformed as

∂ ˆu

[cf. eq. (17)]

Therefore, the force term f is transformed as a Galilean invariant ﬁeld;

ˆf (ˆx, t) = Rωt f (x, t).

Now, let us derive the transformed form of the Navier-Stokes equation (31) in the rotating frame ˆLR.
Combining eqs. (20) and (30), we get

+ (ˆu · ˆ∇)u = Rωt[

+ (u · ∇)u + 2u × Ω + (x × Ω) × Ω].

∂u
∂t

The last two terms in the right-hand side are rewritten as follows

∂ ˆu
∂t

∂ ˆu
∂t

ωt

{2u × Ω + (x × Ω) × Ω}

R
= 2Rωt(u × Ω) + Rωt{(x × Ω) × Ω}
= 2(Rωtu) × Ω + {(Rωtx) × Ω} × Ω
= 2{ˆu − Rωt(x × Ω)} × Ω [cf. eq. (17)]

+ {(Rωtx) × Ω} × Ω

= 2ˆu × Ω + (Ω × ˆx) × Ω [cf. eq. (9)],

which leads to

From eqs. (31), (33), and (36), we ﬁnally get

+ (ˆu · ˆ∇)u − 2ˆu × Ω − (Ω × ˆx) × Ω = Rωt[

+ (u · ∇)u].

∂u
∂t

∂ ˆu
∂t

+ (ˆu · ˆ∇)ˆu = ˆf + 2ˆu × Ω + (Ω × ˆx) × Ω.

The second term in the right hand side is the Coriolis force, and the third term is the centrifugal force. Note that
even if we have another Galilean invariant force in f in the right hand side of eq. (31), e.g., the buoyancy force, the
equation form of (37) does not change.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have shown a general algorithm to derive the evolving equation in a constantly rotating frame of
reference based on the local Galilean transformation and the rotating coordinate transformation of ﬁeld quantities.
This derivation—Eulerian derivation—is applied in a straightforward way to a rotating ﬂuid system to derive the
Coriolis force and the centrifugal force.

The usefulness of the Eulerian derivation becomes evident when we apply it to the derivation of the basic equation
in the rotating system for other physical systems rather than the ﬂuid. Take the magnetic ﬁeld B for the example.
From the Maxwell’s equations, the induction equation of B is written as

in the inertial frame LI . The ∇ × E term in the right hand side of this equation is transformed into the following
form in the rotating frame ˆLR:

[cf. eq.(19)]

[cf. eq.(22)]

∂ ˆB
∂t

(ˆx, t) = − ˆ∇ × ˆE(ˆx, t).

Here we have used ∇ · B = 0, ∇ · (Ω × x) = 0, and eq. (21) in the last step. Comparing eq. (29) with eq. (39), we get

Therefore, the induction equation does not change its form in the rotating frame of reference. (There is no “apparent
induction” term.) This example clearly illustrates the advantage of Eulerian approach of the transformation of the
basic equation in the rotating frame.

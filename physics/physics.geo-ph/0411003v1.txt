Abstract

The occurrence of the September 28, 2004 M =6.0 earthquake at
Parkﬁeld, California, has signiﬁcantly modiﬁed the mean and aperi-
odicity of the series of time intervals between the big events in this
segment of the San Andreas fault. Using the Minimalist Model of
characteristic earthquakes, the Brownian Passage Time Model and
other, standard, statistical schemes as renewal models, we ﬁt the new
data series and recalculate the hazard parameters for the new seismic
cycle. The diﬀerences resulting from these various renewal models are
emphasized.

1 Introduction

Renewal models have been used for more than a quarter of a century to
forecast the time of the next large earthquake on a speciﬁc fault or fault
segment, where large shocks occur repeatedly at approximately regular time
intervals. For this purpose, in the ﬁrst instance, several well-known statistical
distributions were used [4]. Although these distributions, which have only

1

an empirical rooting, generally represent the observed distribution of time
intervals fairly well, they diﬀer signiﬁcantly in their probability predictions
for times much longer than the mean time interval of the data. More recently,
and as an alternative to these purely statistical approaches, some schematic
but physically inspired models have been proposed. Thus, the Brownian
Passage Time Model [5, 6] and especially the Minimalist Model [7], which
is a more explicit cellular automaton model, have the virtue of providing
an intuitive picture of the seismic cycle in a fault or fault segment. The
statistical distributions derived from these two models also provide a good
ﬁt to the data [8].

It is important to emphasize that the occurrence of a new earthquake
in a fault may signiﬁcantly modify the parameters of the best ﬁt of the
statistical distribution used for the adjustment. This is due to the small
number of data in the big-earthquake series for a given fault or fault segment
(usually between four and ten). As a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the ﬁtting
parameters leads to diﬀerent results for the hazard assessment, it is important
to proceed to a recalculation of the new parameters. This is just the case
at the Parkﬁeld segment of the San Andreas fault in California with the
September 28, 2004, M = 6.0 earthquake. Therefore, the purpose of this
short communication is to update the available ﬁts [8, 9] to this new series and
compare the hazard predictions coming from ﬁve diﬀerent renewal models:
the Gamma (G), Lognormal (LN) and Weibull (W) distributions as classical
renewal models, and also the Brownian Passage Time Model (BPT) and the
Minimalist Model (MM), as more recent counterparts.

In Section II, the mean and the aperiodicity of the new series are calcu-
lated. Besides, this section contains the best ﬁts obtained by the method of
moments with the diﬀerent renewal models. Finally in Section III we discuss
the results and present a brief conclusion.

2 Fits to the new series and comparison be-

tween the models

Including the latest event, the Parkﬁeld series [10, 11] consists of seven M
6
characteristic earthquakes at roughly periodic intervals, which occurred on
January 9, 1857; February 2, 1881; March 3, 1901; March 10 1922; June
8, 1934; June 28, 1966 and September 28, 2004. In consequence, the time
lengths, in years, of the observed six seismic cycles are: 24.1, 20.1, 21.0,
12.3, 32.1 and 38.3. Thus, the mean value m, standard deviation s, and
aperiodicity α (i.e., the coeﬃcient of variation, the standard deviation divided

≃

2

by the mean) of this six-data series are:

m = 24.62 yr

s = 9.25 yr

α = 0.3759

(1)

Now, we will proceed to ﬁt these data using the G, LN and W families
of distributions [4] and the BPT and MM models [5, 8]. The statistical
distribution of the cycle lengths in the BPT model is the so-called Inverse
Gaussian Distribution which, as in the three classical distributions mentioned
at the beginning, is a continuum biparametric density distribution. Strictly
speaking, the distribution of the cycle lengths coming from the MM model
is a discrete one and has only one parameter, N (the number of cells in the
cellular automaton array, directly related to the aperiodicity α of the series)
[7, 8]. However, for the ﬁt of the data, it is necessary to assign a deﬁnite
number of years to the adimensional time step of the model. This will be
called τ .

Next, we will write down the explicit analytic form of the four mentioned
continuum probability density distributions. All of them have a correspond-
ing scale parameter and a shape parameter. In all formulae the time, t, is
measured in years.

In this last case, the parameters m and α correspond to the mean and
aperiodicity deﬁned earlier. As we will use the method of moments, within
these four families of distributions, and the same for the MM, we will select
that speciﬁc distribution with parameters such that their mean value and
aperiodicity are equal to the values quoted in Eq. 1. The speciﬁc values of
the parameters that fulﬁll this condition are written in Table 1.

Table 1: Parameter values obtained by the method of moments for the ﬁve
renewal models described in the text for the Parkﬁeld series.

Note that in the MM model [7, 8] the aperiodicity of the series ﬁxes the
number of sites of the array, N = 494. In a minimalist system of this size,
the time of return of the characteristic earthquake has a mean of 5868.6 basic
non-dimensional steps. Comparing this mean with the value m = 24.62 yr
quoted in (1), we deduce that one basic time step of the model corresponds
to τ = 24.62 yr/5868.6 = 0.00420 yr, or around 1.5 days.

In Fig. 1a, we have superimposed the accumulated histogram (empirical
distribution function) of the Parkﬁeld series together with the accumulated
distributions of the ﬁve models, computed by integrating Eqs. 2-5. And in
Fig. 1b we show the residuals for the ﬁve ﬁts. Finally in Fig. 2 we present the
annual (conditional) probability of occurrence derived from the ﬁve models
[4].

3 Conclusions

The results shown in Fig. 1a and b indicate that the ﬁve models used in the
adjustment, although with clear diﬀerences between them, all describe rather
well the Parkﬁeld data. It is clear from Fig 1a that the curve corresponding
to the MM takes oﬀ later than the others. This is due to the fact that in this
model there exists an initial stress shadow with a length of N = 494 basic
steps, i.e, up to 494 times 0.00420 yr, that is 2.07 yr. Thus, in this model,
in the initial 2.07 yr of the cycle deﬁnitely no new event can occur. This is
in stark contrast with the other renewal models, where there is no real stress
shadow. Most distributions have a low or very low probability of occurrence
between 0 an 2.07 yr, but none have a strictly zero probability as the MM has.
The LN and BPT curves plot one upon the other in Figure 1a because in the
range shown in the graph their cumulative probability functions are similar.
Note also that the Weibull model predicts a cumulative probability sensibly
higher for t < 10 yr than the other four models, and that all ﬁve cumulative
distribution functions appear to ‘converge’ in probability in the year 2022,
roughly 18 yr after the last earthquake, with a cumulative probability of

4

around 20%. As for the residuals (Fig 1b), all are lower than 8% at any time
(most of then lower than 4%). The minimum residual is not always related
to the same model, and the ‘best’ model changes with time. This precludes
selecting one particular model as the optimal choice for prediction purposes.
In Fig. 2, where the annual probability of occurrence is shown, there
are several observations worth comment. At the beginning of the cycle the
W curve is the ﬁrst in the take oﬀ and the MM is the last. This reﬂects
what was mentioned in the previous paragraph. Later, there is an interval,
roughly speaking from 2016 to 2023, in which the MM curve is on top of the
others, predicting slightly higher annual probabilities. Around 2030, which
corresponds to the mean recurrence interval of the series, all the models
predict a yearly conditional probability between 8.5% and 10%. And in 2040
and beyond the 5 models start showing their asymptotic behaviour, or, in
other words, their clear discrepancies: the W curve rises up to a probability
of one (according to the W model, there is a 95% probability of having an
earthquake each year after 165 yr from the last one), the LN curve starts
declining, approaching zero as time passes, and the BPT, G and MM curves
tend to a constant, but diﬀerent, asymptotic yearly probability value: 13%,
26%, and 44%, respectively.

The discrepancies between the predictions of these ﬁve approaches cannot
be used to disregard any of them clearly. On the contrary, they can be con-
sidered altogether to give reasonable upper and lower bounds to the annual
probability of occurrence at Parkﬁeld: between 8 and 10% after 25 yr (i.e.,
after one mean cycle length), and between 10 and 15% after 32 yr (i.e., after
1.5 mean cycle lengths).

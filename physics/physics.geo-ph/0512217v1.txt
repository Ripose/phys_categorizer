Abstract. We report measurements of electric potentials at the surface of a spherical
container of liquid sodium in which a magnetized inner core is diﬀerentially rotating. The
azimuthal angular velocities inferred from these potentials reveal a strong super-rotation of
the liquid sodium in the equatorial region, for small diﬀerential rotation. Super-rotation was
observed in numerical simulations by Dormy et al. [1]. We ﬁnd that the latitudinal variation
of the electric potentials in our experiments diﬀers markedly from the predictions of a similar
numerical model, suggesting that some of the assumptions used in the model – steadiness,
equatorial symmetry, and linear treatment for the evolution of both the magnetic and
velocity ﬁelds – are violated in the experiments. In addition, radial velocity measurements,
using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry, provide evidence of oscillatory motion near the outer
sphere at low latitude: it is viewed as the signature of an instability of the super-rotating
region.

Introduction

In the recent years a revived interest has been shown for the rotating spherical Couette ﬂow:
the ﬂow between two concentric spheres that rotate around a common axis z with diﬀerent
angular velocities Ω (outer sphere) and Ω + ∆Ω (inner sphere). Among the reasons for this
renewed interest are the possibility of super-rotation when a magnetic ﬁeld is added, and
the prospect of observing dynamo action with such a ﬂow.

→

The ﬁrst studies [2] dealt with the axisymmetric ﬂow in the limit Ro = ∆Ω/Ω

0
and E = ν/Ωa2
0, where Ro and E are the Rossby and Ekman numbers, respectively,
ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid, and a the radius of the outer sphere. Proudman
[2] discovered that, under the action of the Coriolis force, a vertical shear layer sets in to
accommodate the transition between the ﬂuid at rest (in the frame rotating at Ω) outside
the vertical cylinder tangent to the inner sphere, and the ﬂuid rotating at an angular velocity
ranging from Ω + ∆Ω to Ω + ∆Ω/2 inside the tangent cylinder. Stewartson [3] unraveled the
inner structure of this shear layer for small yet ﬁnite values of the Ekman number, showing
that an ageostrophic layer of width aE1/3 is nested between two geostrophic layers of width
aE2/7 (inwards) and aE1/4 (outwards). Years later, the validity domain of these analytical
results was established in numerical simulations [4, 1].

→

The Stewartson shear layer is expected to become unstable to non-axisymmetric per-
turbations when the Rossby number is increased above a critical value Roc. Experimental

evidence was found by Hide and Titman [5]. These instabilities were also studied in 3D-
numerical simulations by Hollerbach [6] who emphasized the diﬀerence between the Ro > 0
1, and experi-
and Ro < 0 cases. When the Ekman number is small enough then Roc ≪
ments demonstrate that the instabilities are z-independent [7, 8]. Schaeﬀer and Cardin [8]
thus conducted a quasi-geostrophic analysis, and showed that the instabilities are akin to
Rossby waves, thereby explaining the dependence on the sign of Ro. They found that the
βE1/2, where β is associated to the slope of the sphere at the lati-
onset scales as: Roc ∝
tude of the Stewartson layer. Above the threshold, a strong anisotropic and inhomogeneous
Rossby wave turbulence develops, which exhibits a rather steep m−5 spectrum of kinetic
energy in the azimuthal direction [9] (m is the azimuthal number). It means that a direct
cascade of energy is prohibited by the geostrophic constraint, leading to a very low kinetic
energy of the ﬂuid ﬂow at small scales.

Once the instabilities are strong enough and when the ﬂuid is an electric conductor,
the instabilities can produce a magnetic ﬁeld through dynamo action [10]. This happens
when the magnetic Reynolds number Rm = U a/η is larger than some critical value Rmc
(where U is the typical ﬂow velocity of the ﬂuid and η its magnetic diﬀusivity). Within
the quasi-geostrophic approach, Rmc is found to be in the range of 3000. However, full
3D numerical simulations yield much smaller values around 100 [11], but they are limited
to larger values of both the Ekman number and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm = ν/η.
These results validate the project of building an experimental dynamo based on the rotating
spherical Couette ﬂow [12]. After the success of the liquid sodium dynamos in Riga [13] and
Karlsruhe [14], such a ﬂow would get us one step closer to situations relevant to planetary
cores.

However, the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld ~B will have a strong inﬂuence on the ﬂow
itself. This is well illustrated by the numerical studies of Hollerbach [4] and Dormy et al.
[1], who investigate rotating spherical Couette ﬂow with an imposed magnetic ﬁeld. Both
)~u
studies only deal with the axisymmetric solution obtained in the limit Ro
terms neglected in the Navier-Stokes equation) and Rm
0 (eﬀects of the induced magnetic
ﬁeld are neglected). One eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld is to thicken the Stewartson layer. For
large enough magnetic ﬁelds, the quasi-geostrophic character of the ﬂow is broken. More
intriguing, Dormy et al.
[1] discovered that, when the imposed magnetic ﬁeld is an axial
dipole, the ﬂuid can rotate at an angular velocity larger than that of the inner sphere, in
particular when the outer sphere is at rest. This phenomenon of super-rotation is illustrated
in Figure 1, which shows the dimensionless angular velocities (Uϕ/s∆Ω, where Uϕ is the
azimuthal velocity and s the cylindrical radius), meridional electric currents and electric
potentials in a meridional plane. A wide crescent of super-rotation is clearly visible in
Figure 1a. This phenomenon may be explained using the circulation of electric currents
(Figure 1b) : the diﬀerential rotation generates a viscous shear at the outer boundary and
electric currents are induced in the shear layer (named Hartmann layer) so that Lorentz
forces balance the viscous forces. The electric currents of the Hartmann layers loop into
the bulk of the ﬂuid. They tend to follow the dipolar magnetic ﬁeld lines but this is not
possible in the equatorial region where they have to cross the magnetic ﬁeld lines. In this
region, they generate Lorentz forces that accelerate to a super rotating angular velocity a
ring of ﬂuid around the magnetic ﬁeld line tangent to the outer sphere. An asymptotic
analysis of this peculiar phenomenon has been carried out by Dormy et al. [15] for Ω = 0
(also see [16] and [17]). It indicates that the width of the detached shear layer varies as
−1/2, while the thin layers on the rigid surfaces are classical Hartmann layers [28] whose

electromagnetic forces to viscous forces, and is deﬁned in table 2).

Hollerbach [18, 19] showed that the resulting ﬂow and the phenomenon of super-rotation
strongly depend upon both the geometry of the applied magnetic ﬁeld (axial versus dipolar
for example) and the electric boundary conditions on the inner and outer spheres.
In
particular, when both boundaries are perfectly conductive and for an axial homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld, Hollerbach [19] and Hollerbach and Skinner [20] observe that the ﬂuid rotates
in the direction opposite to that of the driving inner sphere, and that the amplitude of this
counter-rotation increases with the strength of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. Buehler [21]
provided a simple explanation for this phenomenon: he showed that the ﬂow rate in the
counter-rotating jet is independent of the Hartmann number (provided it is large enough),
and since the width of the jet decreases as Ha

−1/2, its velocity must increase as Ha1/2.

In contrast, with a dipolar magnetic ﬁeld and an insulating outer sphere, the super-
rotation is positive and remains below 1.4 for Ω = 0 [1]. Hollerbach and Skinner [20] also
studied the linear stability of the axisymmetric jets for an applied axial magnetic ﬁeld.
Whatever the electrical boundary conditions, they predicted the onset of instability for
Reynolds numbers of a few thousands and their non-linear calculations reveal a few drifting
vortices aligned with the imposed magnetic ﬁeld.

When global rotation is present (Ω

= 0), a competition takes place between the Lorentz
and Coriolis forces. As the Elsasser number Λ = σB2/ρΩ decreases (σ the electrical con-
ductivity and ρ the density of the ﬂuid), the ring of super-rotation stretches in the vertical
direction and gets closer to the tangent cylinder, while super-rotation decreases [1]. The
magnetostrophic regime, in which both forces are comparable is of particular interest, since
it is the regime expected for planetary dynamos (e.g.
[22]). The above analyses always

Little is known when all non-linear eﬀects are present. Is super-rotation still present?
How is the angular velocity distributed? Which symmetries are preserved? What are the
characteristics of the meridional circulation?

In this paper, we present the ﬁrst experimental measurements of velocities in a magne-
tostrophic spherical Couette ﬂow in presence of a strong dipolar magnetic ﬁeld. Azimuthal
velocities in the liquid sodium ﬂow are obtained by measuring the electric potential at the
outer surface. Radial proﬁles of the radial velocity are measured with an ultrasonic Doppler
velocimeter. A wide range of parameters is explored, with magnetic Reynolds number Rm
up to 25. Experiments in a similar geometry have been conducted with a weak axial mag-
netic ﬁeld and without global rotation [24, 25]. Turbulent liquid sodium ﬂows in cylinders
have also been investigated [26].

The DT S set-up and measurement techniques are described in section 2. The relevant
dimensionless numbers are listed in table 2. Section 3 is devoted to our experimental results,
which are discussed in section 4.

2. Experimental set-up

A schematic drawing of the central part of the DT S experiment is shown in Figure 2.
Forty litres of liquid sodium are contained between a 7 cm-radius inner sphere and a 21
cm-radius outer spherical surface. The 5 mm-thick outer spherical shell is made of stainless
steel, which is about 8 times less electrically conductive than sodium at 130◦C, the typical
experimental temperature. The relevant properties of liquid sodium at 130◦C are given in
Table 1. The inner sphere is made of two hollow copper hemispheres ﬁlled with 5 layers of
rare-earth cobalt bricks. The copper wall thickness varies from 10 to 20 mm. The electrical
conductivity of copper is about 4 times larger than that of sodium at 130◦C. Once ﬁlled, the
two hemispheres have been welded using an electron beam technique at the Laboratoire de
l’Acc´el´erateur Lin´eaire in Orsay. The assembly has ﬁnally been magnetized in a 5 T axial
magnetic ﬁeld, at the High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Grenoble. Outside the copper
sphere, the magnetic ﬁeld is found to be an axial dipole, aligned with the axis of rotation
and pointing downwards, with:

~B(r, θ) =

4πr3 (2~er cos θ + ~eθ sin θ)

700 Am2 the magnetic dipolar
in spherical coordinates, with θ the colatitude and M =
moment, yielding a magnetic ﬁeld magnitude ranging from 0.41 T at the poles of the inner
sphere down to 0.008 T at the equator of the outer sphere.

2.1 Electric potentials and azimuthal velocity

Electric potentials are measured at several latitudes on the rotating outer sphere (see Figure
2). The electric potential is obtained by simply sticking copper electrodes into 1 mm-
diameter 4 mm-deep blind holes drilled in the stainless steel wall. Stainless steel is a poor
electric conductor as compared to liquid sodium and thus it does not aﬀect the dynamically
generated electric potential, but it is a good enough electric conductor for the impedance
of electrode pairs to be much smaller than that of the acquisition system. The signals pass

The electric potentials measured at the surface can be related to the azimuthal velocities

beneath the Hartmann layer. Indeed, from the θ-component of Ohm’s law:

where ∆V is the electric potential diﬀerence between two electrodes placed along the same

Br the radial component of the magnetic ﬁeld at the latitude of the electrodes, and jθ the
θ-component of the electric current. Further assuming that the latitudinal component of
electric currents is negligible outside the Hartmann layer, and since the electric potential is
constant across Hartmann layers [28], the potential diﬀerence measured at the surface can
be directly related to the bulk velocity:

(3)

Note that with our sign convention and since the magnetic dipole has its south pole in
the northern hemisphere, we expect positive ∆V in that hemisphere when the inner sphere
spins from West to East (Uϕ > 0).

2.2 Ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry and meridional circulation

We measure radial proﬁles of the radial velocity of the ﬂuid by ultrasonic Doppler velocime-
try. At two diﬀerent latitudes (10◦ and
20◦) on the rotating outer sphere, we install
ultrasonic transducers in removable assemblies (see Figure 2). The transducers operate at
4 MHz and their active part is 5 mm in diameter (type TR0405LS from Signal Processing,
Switzerland). The slightly diverging ultrasonic beam enters liquid sodium after passing
through a 1.4 mm-thick stainless steel wall, which is polished on the sodium side.

−

The electric signals pass through the above-mentioned slip-ring system, to be analyzed
in the laboratory frame. Note that the 36-track system is enclosed in an electromagnetic
shield, to prevent contamination of the weak back-scattered echoes by ambient noise. The
treatment of the ultrasonic pulses and echoes is performed on a DOP 2000 velocimeter
(Signal Processing). The instrument issues a series of 8-cycles pulses and listens to echoes,
which are back scattered by weak heterogeneities present in the ﬂuid. The time elapsed
between the pulse and the echo provides the distance of the scatterer, while the associated
Doppler frequency shift yields the radial velocity at that distance. In this manner, radial
proﬁles of the radial component of velocity can be obtained, and repeated every 30 ms or
so. Since liquid metals are opaque, ultrasound Doppler velocimetry is the most promising
non-intrusive technique for mapping ﬂows in MHD and dynamo experiments. However, the
application to liquid metals raises speciﬁc issues and proves diﬃcult: successful measure-
ments in liquid gallium and sodium are recent [29, 30]. While electric potentials at the
surface of the sphere are sensitive only to the azimuthal velocities, we get constraints on
the meridional circulation from the ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry.

Table 2: Typical values of the relevant parameters and dimensionless numbers for diﬀerent
imposed rotation frequencies f = Ω/2π and diﬀerential rotation frequencies ∆f = ∆Ω/2π.
For the numbers that depend on the magnetic ﬁeld strength, two values are given, the
ﬁrst one with B = Bi = 0.2 T at the equator of the inner sphere, the second one with
B = Bo = 0.008 T at the equator of the outer sphere.

2.3 Dimensionless numbers

Table 2 gives the typical values of the dimensionless numbers in our experiments. We note
that the Joule dissipation time τJ is very short. The Hartmann number Ha does not depend
on the imposed rotation rates:
it is large everywhere in the sphere, and the thickness of
the regular Hartmann layers δHa is less than 1mm. Ua is the velocity of the Alfv´en waves.
When the outer sphere spins, the Ekman number is less than 2 10−6 and the thickness of
the regular Ekman layers less than 0.3 mm. The values of the Elsasser number Λ and of λ
indicate that the magnetostrophic regime (Λ
1 [12]) can be achieved in the
interior of the sphere, while the ﬂow is strongly inﬂuenced by the magnetic ﬁeld near the
inner sphere, and by global rotation near the outer sphere. Even for moderate diﬀerential
rotation (∆f = 1 Hz), the magnetic Reynolds number Rm is larger than 1, meaning that
the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld depends on the ﬂow itself. Note that the Rossby number Ro is
simply deﬁned as Ro = ∆Ω/Ω = ∆f /f . Finally, the values of the interaction parameter
N indicate that the ﬂow is strongly inﬂuenced by the Lorentz forces, except near the outer
sphere, where (~u
)~u terms dominate. However, we note in the discussion section that
even with a strong magnetic ﬁeld, some inertial terms can play an important role.

3.1 Azimuthal velocities from electric potentials at the surface of the

Figure 3 shows temporal records of the diﬀerences of electric potential between several pairs
of electrodes at the surface of the outer sphere. In Figure 3a, the outer sphere is at rest,
and the rotation rate ∆f of the inner sphere is raised in steps between -8 Hz and 8 Hz.
During each step, the rotation rate is kept constant to within 5 10−3 during some 300 s.
The electric signals are low-pass ﬁltered to retain frequencies below 10 Hz. Each velocity
step generates a jump in electric potential, forming a plateau sometimes preceded by a
slow relaxation (probably of thermal origin). The signals in Figure 3 demonstrate that the
ﬂuctuations of azimuthal velocity in this frequency range are very small compared to their
mean value, and that the coupling between the inner sphere and the ﬂuid is very strong
(between steps, the ﬂuid reaches its equilibrium velocity in less than 2 s). The amplitude
of the signals is in the mV range.

In each pair, the electrodes are all 10◦ apart, and the latitude of their mid-point ranges
from 10◦ to 40◦. For 40◦, two pairs have been installed along two diﬀerent meridians.
Their signals are undistinguishable in Figure 3. The records show that the diﬀerence in
electric potential increases with latitude, related to variations of the velocity ﬁeld as the
corresponding increase is known for the imposed radial magnetic ﬁeld Br (see equation 3).
Figure 3b shows a similar temporal record, but this time the outer sphere spins at a
constant rotation rate of 4.5 Hz during the whole sequence. The same behavior is observed.
For each imposed ∆f we retrieve the value of the electric potential plateau.

We ﬁrst concentrate on the signal measured at latitude 40◦. We derive Uϕ, using equa-
tion 3 and divide it by s∆Ω , where s is the cylindrical radius at that latitude. We can thus
compare the azimuthal velocity of the ﬂuid relative to that of solid body rotation (with the
inner sphere) for diﬀerent f and ∆f .

Figure 4 summarizes our results as a function of ∆f , for various f . We observe that, for
a given f , the normalized velocity is maximum, reaching 0.8 to 0.9, when ∆f is minimum.
We note that azimuthal velocity levels oﬀ at a higher value when global rotation is present,
in particular for Ro > 0.

We now discuss the case without global rotation (f = 0). The normalized azimuthal
increases, and seems to level oﬀ at a value of 0.5 for

The numerical simulations provide an excellent guide to interpret our results. We have
run the numerical model described in [15], with parameters as close as possible to the
experimental conditions: same Hartmann number (see Table 2), electrical conductivities in
the ratio 32/8/1 for inner sphere/ﬂuid/outer shell, with appropriate thickness for the latter.
The geometry of the applied magnetic ﬁeld is the same as in our experiments (axial dipole).
Figure 1 shows the contours of Uϕ/s∆Ω, meridional electric currents, and electric potential

move is to simply get Uϕ/s∆Ω for the other latitudes using equation 3. This is what we

rotation angular velocities up to 30% larger than solid body rotation with the inner sphere.
However, the assumptions used to derive equation 3 appear to break down when approaching
the equator. This is illustrated by the curves derived from the above-mentionned numerical
model. The true azimuthal velocity at r/a = 0.95, outside the Hartmann layer, exhibits a
slow decrease from the high latitudes down to 20◦, where it rises sharply to a maximum of
more than 1.3 at the equator. In contrast, the azimuthal velocity inferred from the electric
potential at the surface using equation 3 is almost twice smaller at the equator, while the
diﬀerences are small above 40◦. There are two causes for this discrepancy and the clue is
given by the third curve, which shows the azimuthal velocity that would be derived from
equation 3 using the electric potential at r/a = 0.95. This time, the agreement with the
true velocity is perfect down to latitude 20◦. Around the equator, the velocity is again
underestimated. This demonstrates that the contribution of electric currents in the core
(see equation 2), is indeed negligible at latitudes above 20◦, but that the electric potential
is not quite constant across the Hartmann layer. In the Tropics, both approximations break
down: the electric potential is not constant across the Hartmann layer, and the electric
currents are not negligible beneath it. It is clear from Figure 1 that we are still under the

−1/2 thick layer at these latitudes.

Going back to our experimental measurements, we thus decide to directly plot the elec-
tric potential diﬀerences as a function of latitude. However, in order to focus on latitudinal
variations, we normalize them with the potential diﬀerence measured at 40◦. Figure 6a
shows our results for f = 0 and ∆f varying from
8 to 8 Hz. All proﬁles are remarkably
similar despite a factor of almost 2 in their absolute level (see Figure 4). The line derived
from our numerical model falls well below our experimental points.

The measurements for f = 4.5 Hz are given in Figure 6b. A similar behavior is observed.
Only those points with

3.2 Meridional circulation from ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry

We now turn to the constraints brought on the meridional circulation by the analysis of
radial proﬁles of radial velocity, obtained by ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. Note that we
cannot measure azimuthal velocities with this technique in the present set-up. Figure 7
shows two examples of spatio-temporal plots and corresponding probability density func-
tions (pdf ) of velocity as a function of depth. Two diﬀerent behaviors are observed. When
the outer sphere is a rest (top row), strong and rapid oscillations extend from the outer
surface down to about 40-50 mm. The corresponding pdf is very asymmetric: centripetal
velocities reaching much larger values than centrifugal ones. Smooth stable centripetal ve-
locities are measured from 80 mm down to the inner sphere. The equatorial oscillations
are reminiscent of the jet instabilities observed in spherical Couette ﬂow in the absence of
a magnetic ﬁeld. The rotation of the outer sphere kills the equatorial oscillations (bottom
row), and the pdf is Gaussian at all depths.

Getting back to the case with an outer sphere at rest, we ﬁnd that the amplitude of the
equatorial oscillations increases with
. Around the depth of 30 mm, we measure the
|
spread ∆Ur for which the pdf has dropped down to one tenth of its maximum value. When
the pdf are rescaled using ∆Ur and an oﬀset U0, they all have the same shape, as shown in
Figure 8a. We then plot ∆Ur/s∆Ω as a function of ∆f (Figure 8b) and observe the same
kind of pattern as for azimuthal velocities: the ratio is maximum for small values of ∆f .
The ultrasonic probe has been installed at two diﬀerent latitudes: +10◦ and
20◦. When we
compare the two series of results, we ﬁnd that higher ∆Ur/sΩ values characterize latitude
+10◦. Since the equatorial oscillations probably result from instability of the equatorial
azimuthal jet, this observation is in agreement with an increase of diﬀerential rotation
towards the equator.

−

When the outer sphere rotates, the equatorial oscillations disappear, even when the

Rossby number Ro = ∆f /f gets down to -2.

4. Discussion

We have conducted experiments on the spherical Couette ﬂow with global rotation and an
imposed dipolar magnetic ﬁeld. The working ﬂuid is liquid sodium, and we have developed
several instrumental techniques to characterize the ﬂow. Surface electric potentials convey
crucial informations about the azimuthal velocities in the ﬂuid. At latitude 40◦, the di-
mensionless angular velocities Uϕ/s∆Ω we retrieve reach 0.9. They are maximum for small
diﬀerential rotation rates. When the outer sphere is at rest, the extrapolation to ∆f = 0 is
in excellent agreement with the predictions of our numerical model. This numerical model
exhibits super-rotation. It uses the same dipolar magnetic ﬁeld and Hartmann number as
in the experiments, and takes into account the ﬁnite electrical conductivities of the inner
and outer walls.

However, the latitudinal variation of electric potentials measured in the experiments
diﬀers markedly from the numerical predictions, and exhibit larger-than-expected values at
low latitudes, which are not explained by the ﬁnite conductivity of the outer wall (correctly
taken into account in the numerical model). Under the assumptions of the numerical model

The diﬀerence could be due to the meridional ﬂow: while it is absent from the numerical
solution for f = 0, we measure radial velocities reaching about 10% of the azimuthal ve-
locities. The meridional ﬂow advects the magnetic ﬁeld lines, producing additional Lorentz
forces. Thus, the meridional ﬂow could be driven by centrifugal forces (one component of
the Reynolds stresses) resisted by magnetic forces. According to this scenario, magnetic
ﬁeld lines and the associated region of super-rotation would be pushed closer to the surface
in the equatorial region. The electric potentials measured at the surface could then directly
reveal the super-rotation region. The numerical results of Cupal et al.
[23] suggest that
these additional Lorentz forces could also amplify the super-rotation.

Even when the outer sphere is at rest, we obtain slightly diﬀerent results depending
upon the direction of diﬀerential rotation. The equatorial symmetry could be broken by
electric currents crossing the equatorial plan. This hypothesis could be tested by measuring
the electric potential in both hemispheres in future experiments.

Finally, we note that the ultrasonic Doppler velocity measurements show that the ﬂow
is not steady in the equatorial region, except when the outer sphere spins. Instead, rapid
oscillations of the radial velocity are observed, even for the lowest

The latitudinal proﬁles of angular velocity inferred from the electric potentials are re-
markably similar across a wide range of parameters. This seems to indicate that a rather
universal behavior is behind all this. More numerical modelling, relaxing the assumptions
of [1, 15] and close to the experimental parameters are needed to explain our experimental
ﬁndings.

We have obtained excellent results with ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. Only radial
velocities can be measured in the present set-up, but we are currently adapting it to ac-
commodate measurements of the azimuthal velocities. This direct measurement will give us
the amplitude and the radial distribution of the time-averaged angular velocity at a given
latitude. Measurements of the induced toroidal magnetic ﬁeld inside the sphere could also
help characterize the latitudinal variation of the angular velocities.

Global rotation appears to enhance super-rotation, in particular at large ∆f . As a
consequence, very large azimuthal velocities are inferred from electric potentials, yielding
Rm values in excess of 30, with a power input below 4 kW. This result and the observation
of a sizeable meridional circulation make the project of building a dynamo experiment based
on the rotating spherical Couette ﬂow appealing [12].

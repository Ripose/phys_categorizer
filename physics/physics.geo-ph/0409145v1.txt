Abstract

Choosing a simple class of ﬂows, with characteristics that may be present in the
Earth’s core, we study the ability to generate a magnetic ﬁeld when the ﬂow is per-
mitted to oscillate periodically in time. The ﬂow characteristics are parameterised
by D, representing a diﬀerential rotation, M , a meridional circulation, and C, a
roll component characterising convective rolls. The dynamo action of all solutions
with ﬁxed parameters (steady ﬂows) is known from previous studies. Dynamo ac-
tion is sensitive to these ﬂow parameters and fails spectacularly for much of the
parameter space where magnetic ﬂux is concentrated into small regions, leading
to high diﬀusion. In addition, steady ﬂows generate only steady or regularly re-
versing oscillatory ﬁelds and cannot therefore reproduce irregular geomagnetic-type
reversal behaviour. Oscillations of the ﬂow are introduced by varying the ﬂow pa-
rameters in time, deﬁning a closed orbit in the space (D, M ). When the frequency
of the oscillation is small, the net growth rate of the magnetic ﬁeld over one period
approaches the average of the growth rates for steady ﬂows along the orbit. At
increased frequency time-dependence appears to smooth out ﬂux concentrations,
often enhancing dynamo action. Dynamo action can be impaired, however, when
ﬂux concentrations of opposite signs occur close together as smoothing destroys the
ﬂux by cancellation. It is possible to produce geomagnetic-type reversals by mak-
ing the orbit stray into a region where the steady ﬂows generate oscillatory ﬁelds.
In this case, however, dynamo action was not found to be enhanced by the time-
dependence. A novel approach is taken to solving the time-dependent eigenvalue
problem, where by combining Floquet theory with a matrix-free Krylov-subspace
method we avoid large memory requirements for storing the matrix required by the
standard approach.

Introduction

Unlike the Sun or Jupiter, the Earth’s dynamo runs on a tight heat bud-
get and may therefore rely on a signiﬁcant large-scale component to the
ﬂow.
In addition to the dominant dipole component of the geomagnetic
ﬁeld, there is some observational evidence to suggest the ﬁeld contains a
persistent non-axisymmetric component (Gubbins and Kelly, 1993). Both
may be indicative of a steady component to the underlying core ﬂow. This
prompted a kinematic study of dynamo action from a class of large-scale
steady candidate core-ﬂows (Gubbins et al. (2000a), Gubbins et al. (2000b),
Gubbins and Gibbons (2002) hereafter referred to as papers I–III). Steady
ﬂows, particularly if they contain stagnation points, tend to concentrate
magnetic ﬂux into small regions with large energy loss due to diﬀusion. Of-
ten, increasing the ﬂow speed to overcome diﬀusive loss simply results in
more concentrated ﬂux and faster decay. On the other hand, chaotic ﬂows
appear to make better dynamos, perhaps because the mixing properties of
the ﬂow prevents permanent ﬂux concentration and exponential separation
of neighbouring particles in the ﬂow lead to stretching of the magnetic ﬁeld
(Brummell et al., 1998). The dynamo mechanisms of complicated chaotic
ﬂows are diﬃcult to understand. We are therefore motivated to ﬁrst study
the eﬀects of simple ﬂows that ﬂuctuate about a steady mean. Although
the Earth’s dipole has persisted for a long time, secular variation includ-
ing excursions of the magnetic pole may indicate that ﬂuctuations of the
large-scale ﬂow are present in the Earth’s core.

Kinematic theory ignores the nonlinearity of back-reaction by the mag-
netic ﬁeld on the ﬂow, and considers only the time evolution of the magnetic
ﬁeld b as governed by the induction equation

∂tb = Rm∇ ∧ (u ∧ b) + ∇2b.

(1)

The induction equation has been non-dimensionalised with the timescale for
magnetic diﬀusion, the length scale d, the radius of the sphere, and in this
work the velocity u is normalised such that the magnetic Reynolds number
Rm is unity for a ﬂow of unit kinetic energy. For a given steady ﬂow the
induction equation is linear in b and has eigenfunction solutions of the form
b(r, θ, φ; t) = eσt B(r, θ, φ). Dynamo action is established if ℜ(σ) > 0. This
simple test is the major advantage of the kinematic approach. The alterna-
tive is to integrate in time the nonlinear problem for both the velocity and
magnetic ﬁeld until one is convinced the magnetic ﬁeld will not ultimately
decay; this is expensive and the results can be uncertain. The advantage re-
mains, however, when the ﬂow varies in time but is periodic; Floquet theory
gives an eigenvalue problem for the growth rate.

Backus (1958) was ﬁrst to show kinematic dynamo action by a time-
dependent ﬂow. His dynamo employed periods of stasis while high harmonics
in the ﬁeld decayed, enabling him to establish convergence of the solution.

2

Time dependence may even lead to dynamo action when no single snapshot
of the ﬂow can generate magnetic ﬁeld on its own. Magnetic ﬁelds can
grow during an initial transient period under the inﬂuence of a subcritical
steady ﬂow, the most familiar example being the production of toroidal ﬁeld
from the action of diﬀerential rotation on poloidal ﬁeld.
If the induction
equation were self-adjoint and its eigenfunctions orthogonal it would be a
simple matter to prove that all such transients decay; it is the non-normal
property that allows transients to grow. The initial ﬁelds which optimise
transient growth for ﬂows in a sphere, including one of the ﬂows here, have
been studied by Livermore and Jackson (2004). Unfortunately, if the ﬂow
is steady the ﬁeld eventually dies away and only the slowest decaying mode
If the ﬂow is permitted to be time dependent, however, once a
remains.
transient ﬁeld associated with the initial ﬂow has grown, a change in the
ﬂow can encourage further growth. In plane-layer ﬂow it has been shown
that by repeatedly switching the orientation of the ﬂow it is possible to take
advantage of these transients (Gog et al., 1999), and to ﬁnd dynamo action
where each ﬂow in isolation does not dynamo kinematically.

Another reason to extend the studies to time-dependent ﬂows is that
steady ﬂows cannot account for the irregularity of geomagnetic reversals.
The induction equation is linear with eigenfunctions b that change with t
only in magnitude, when ℑ(σ) = 0, or oscillatory solutions that reverse
polarity with ﬁxed period 2π/ℑ(σ). Geomagnetic-type reversals require
changes in the ﬂow. Sarson and Jones (1999) described irregular reversals
that occurred in simulations with their 2 1
2 -dimensional model. The mecha-
nism could be interpreted kinematically, and reversals were observed to occur
when ﬂuctuations in the ﬂow lead to a reduced meridional circulation. More
recently Wicht and Olsen (2004) studied reversals in a fully self-consistent
but quasi-periodic system. The reversal mechanism they proposed also ap-
peals largely to kinematic principles and appears to reverse with approx-
imately ﬁxed period even when nonlinearity through the Lorentz force is
omitted.

The class of steady ﬂows explored in I–III was originally prescribed by
Kumar and Roberts (1975) and, with parameters chosen to mimic ﬂows near
the limit of Braginsky (1964), was shown to be capable of dynamo action.
Dependence of the dynamo on a much wider range of parameter values
was later found in I. The Kumar–Roberts ﬂow is conﬁned to the sphere
of unit radius, the exterior of which is assumed to be perfectly insulating.
Three components of the ﬂow represent a diﬀerential rotation, a meridional
circulation and a convective overturn,

u = ǫ0t0

1 + ǫ1s0

2 + (ǫ2s2c

2 + ǫ3s2s

2 ).

(2)

Following the nomenclature detailed in I, the ǫi are constrained such that
ǫ2 = ǫ3 and the kinetic energy of the ﬂow is unity. The ﬂow is parameterised

3

by (D, M )-space, where D = D(ǫ0), M = M (ǫ1) and |D| + |M | ≤ 1. The
parameters D and M are measures of the diﬀerential rotation and meridional
circulation respectively.

For a steady forcing ﬂow, writing b(t) = eσtB, where B is independent

of t, (1) can be expressed as the eigenvalue problem

σ B = F B.

(3)

In paper I dynamo action was established for approximately half the (D, M )-
space (Fig. 1). Sarson and Gubbins (1996) and III found a number of oscilla-
tory solutions for steady ﬂows in a region which corresponds to the dynamo
wave solutions of the αω equations in the Braginsky limit — |D| → 1 in a
manner such that 1 − |D|2 = c |M | where c is a constant. The oscillatory
region was found in I to extend only for a very narrow range in M , shown
schematically in Fig. 1. The majority of solutions are steady. Given the
narrow range for M , it is apparent that only a small degree of meridional
circulation is required to stabilise the ﬁeld to steady solutions. On the other
hand, the existence of oscillatory solutions for low M appears to be a fairly
robust feature as the range in D for which they exist is large, and extends
well beyond the limit of Braginsky.

In this work, the exploration above is extended to the dynamo action of
ﬂows with D = D(t) and M = M (t) periodic in time, with a given period
T . The induction equation (1) can be written as

∂tb = F(t) b,

(4)

(5)

with periodic forcing F(T + t) = F(t). It follows from Floquet’s theorem
(see §2) that solutions may be written in the form b(T + t) = eσ1T b(t)
where the real part of σ1 is the net growth rate over one period. Setting
b(t) = eσ1t B(t), so that B(T + t) = B(t), substitution into (4) deﬁnes the
eigenvalue problem for B,

σ1 B = (F − ∂t) B.

The critical magnetic Reynolds number for which the ﬁeld is marginally
stable, ℜ(σ) = 0, is denoted Rc

m.

Both the steady and non-steady eigenvalue problems (3) and (5) per-
mit solutions for four linearly independent spatial symmetries, axial dipole,
axial quadrupole, equatorial dipole and equatorial quadrupole. Symmetry
selection in the steady case was studied in II. Here only the geophysically
interesting axial dipole symmetry will be considered.

2 Numerical method

Steady ﬂows have been studied using extensions of the method ﬁrst devel-
oped by Bullard and Gellman (1954). Toroidal and poloidal potentials for

4

the magnetic ﬁeld are expanded in spherical harmonics, with truncation at
degree L. A ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme is applied on Nr points in the radial
dimension leading to the discretised eigenvalue problem

σ B = E B.

(6)

The matrix E has dimensions NrNh × NrNh, where after symmetry consid-
erations the number of harmonics Nh ∼ 1
2 L2. As the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme
only connects neighbouring points, E is block banded where each block has
size Nh × Nh. Eigenvectors are then calculated by either by inverse itera-
tion or by the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) on the inverse.
Due to the performance of both methods with respect to the distribution
of the eigenvalues, both operate on the inverse and require the (banded)
LU factorisation of E. Memory requirements scale like several times N 2
hNr,
depending on the stencil size of the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation. Solu-
tions have generally been calculated with second order diﬀerences, and L
not much larger than twenty. The storage requirement for the large matrix
is the limiting factor for the calculation.

For the time-dependent eigenvalue problem (5) with the same spatial rep-
resentation, applying a Fourier expansion in time introduces at least another
factor Nt to the storage requirements. This can be minimised by permit-
ting only sinusoidal forcings, but due to the structure of the matrix memory
requirements are prohibitive with respect to calculation of the LU factorisa-
tion (a few times N 2
r Nt). Storage is a signiﬁcant diﬃculty in multiplying
by the inverse or in calculating the inverse of a suitable preconditioner for
the time-dependent problem.

hN 2

Instead we have adopted a method that does not require storage of the
matrix, which we call the matrix-free Krylov subspace method.
It is an
adaptation of a method used to ﬁnd steady solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations by Edwards et al. (1994). Periodicity of the ﬂow is incorporated
in the following manner (Verhulst, 1996). Writing the discrete form of (4)
as

the matrix G(t) satisfying ∂tG(t) = F(t) G(t), with G(0) = I,
is the funda-
mental matrix of the system (7). Evolution of a starting solution is then
given by

For any T -periodic F(t), there exist matrices P(t) and E such that the fun-
damental matrix can be written

(7)

(8)

(9)

where E is independent of t and P(t) is T -periodic (Floquet’s theorem). It
follows immediately that the change in the solution over one period is given

∂tb = F(t)b,

b(t) = G(t) b(0).

G(t) = P(t) eE t,

5

by

b(T ) = G(T ) b(0),

G(T ) = e

E T = A.

(10)

The stability of solutions to (7) is determined by the eigenvalues λ of the
constant matrix A. If b(0) is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λ = eσ1T ,
we ﬁnd that b(T + t) = eσ1T b(t) for any t. The real part of the Floquet
exponents σ1 correspond to growth rates of the solutions. Although A is
unknown, from (8) we see that the eﬀect of multiplying by A is equivalent to
the result of timestepping through one period. Therefore we do not have to
calculate and store A explicitly. Note that for a steady forcing F, the period
T can be chosen arbitrarily.

The eigenvalue problem for A is well suited to the Arnoldi process (Arnoldi,

1951), which tends to pick out eigenvalues isolated in the complex plane.
The many decaying modes have λ clustered about the origin, marginal
modes correspond to |λ| close to unity. At each iteration we add to the
Krylov-subspace given by span{b, Ab, ..., Ak−1b} which we hope contains
our solutions. In exact arithmetic the kth Krylov subspace is equivalent to
span{b1, ..., bk} where the basis vectors bk are obtained from the Arnoldi
method. Numerically the latter set is better suited to span the space. The
Arnoldi process is summarised as follows: (1) Take a suitable normalised ini-
tial basis vector b1 = b/kbk2. (2) At the kth iteration evaluate (timestep)
˜bk+1 = A bk. (3) The result ˜bk+1 is then orthogonalised against previous
vectors in the basis by the modiﬁed Gram–Schmidt method:

hjk = h˜bk+1, bji,

˜bk+1 := ˜bk+1 − hjkbj;

j ≤ k.

(4) Setting hk+1,k = k˜bk+1k2, the process continues from (2) with the next
basis vector bk+1 = ˜bk+1/hk+1,k. Construct Qk = [b1, ..., bk] and Hk =
[hjm]j,m≤k. From steps (3) and (4) we expect hk+1,k → 0.
In this case,
looking carefully at the steps above, the results of the Arnoldi process can
be written AQk = QkHk. Multiplying on the right by eigenvectors x of Hk
we ﬁnd that they are related to those of A by b = Qkx. For non-zero hk+1,k
eigenvectors have residual kA b − λbk2 = |hk+1,k||xk|, where xk is the last
element of the k-vector x. Thus, at each iteration eigenvalues λ of Hk are
approximate eigenvalues of A.

In practice the residual |hk+1,k||xk| tends to overestimate the error, and
in our calculations the Arnoldi process is stopped when the largest eigen-
values of Hk are suﬃciently converged. The number of iterations required
is typically of order 100 or less, and so the eigenvalues of the small matrix
Hk can be cheaply calculated by the QR algorithm. The memory required
to store the basis vectors scales like NhNrk.
It is possible to restart the
Arnoldi process with a more suitable starting vector obtained from the pro-
cess so far, but without completely restarting the new process from scratch.
This implicit restarting allows further reduction of memory requirements by
reducing the number of basis vectors at each restart (Lehoucq et al., 1998).

6

With k small, restarting was not found to be necessary, however. The stencil
of the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme does not explicitly aﬀect the storage require-
ments. Basis vectors were therefore timestepped with a fourth order ﬁnite
diﬀerence scheme. Timestepping was performed with the benchmarked code
of Gibbons, Jones and Zhang (Christensen et al., 2001).

Another advantage of the matrix-free method is that, given a timestep-
ping code, only a few extra lines of code are required to incorporate the
Arnoldi process, therefore leaving signiﬁcantly less room for error. The
code was veriﬁed by comparison with the matrix method used in I–III for
the steady problem, adjustments for the periodic case in our matrix-free
method are minimal. Table 1(a) shows the leading two eigenvalues for the
of the steady Kumar–Roberts ﬂow, (D, M ) = (0.98354915, 0.0001632689),
at Rm = 1000 calculated using the method in I–III. Table 1(b) shows the
same eigenvalues calculated using our method. The higher order radial dif-
ferences used in the timestepping code leads to more rapid convergence with
Nr. Table 1(c) shows that incorporating the Arnoldi method accelerates con-
vergence relative to timestepping alone (and calculation of more than one
eigenvalue is possible). The same starting vector was used for both calcula-
tions. The period T can be chosen arbitrarily for the steady ﬂow case, but
if chosen too small more iterations are required and therefore more basis
vectors must be stored. For these calculations we set T = 0.001.

As the structure of the eigenfunctions varies with D and M , so does
the convergence with Nr and L. For most of the following analysis a radial
resolution of Nr = 50 and a spectral truncation of L = 18 was adopted.
Checks at higher resolutions were calculated where growth rates were found
to vary rapidly with the parameters.

3 Results

Periodic ﬂows are deﬁned by a closed orbit in (D, M )-space. We restrict
ourselves to simple sinusoidal variations in time with a single frequency ω:

D(t) = D0 + AD cos(ωt),
M (t) = M0 + AM sin(ωt).

(11)

It is the aim of this section to assess how the amplitude of variations AD,M
and frequency ω aﬀect the growth rates and therefore the dynamo action.

3.1 Magnetic growth rates for time-varying ﬂows

Figure 2 shows growth rates for diﬀerent amplitudes of variations about
the point (D0, M0) = (0.25, −0.14), marked A in Fig. 1, which lies on a
line of minimum Rm extending from the Braginsky limit point (1, 0) (see I,
Table 5). The majority of neighbouring points have lower growth rates for

7

the given value of Rm = 87. Figure 2 shows that the eﬀect of oscillations of
the ﬂow on the growth rates is more pronounced with increased oscillation
amplitude.

For a steady ﬂow, given any small real number ε > 0 there exists a ﬁnite
time t such that transients are reduced so that |σ − σ(t)| < ε, where σ is the
growth rate corresponding to the steady ﬂow at each point on the orbit, and
σ(t) is the growth rate of an arbitrary initial ﬁeld as it adjusts to the ﬂow.
Provided that growth rates are piecewise continuous (for example D(t) could
be discontinuous but periodic, see Backus 1958), a frequency ω can always
be selected low enough such that net growth rate over the cycle is close to
the mean ¯σ of those on the orbit. The limit σ1(ω) → ¯σ as ω → 0 is observed
in the numerical calculations. What is more interesting, however, is that
with ﬁnite ω the dynamo can do much better than this mean, σ1(ω) > ¯σ,
as seen in most ﬁgures for the growth rate. Figure 3 shows that the eﬀect
increases with Rm and that the peak occurs at a frequency ω that increases
in proportion to Rm.

Meridional sections of the magnetic ﬁeld for this ﬂow are plotted in Fig.
4. The two times correspond closely to the points on the orbit which have the
maximum (upper row) and minimum growth rates for steady ﬂows (ω → 0).
The structure of these eigenfunctions is similar; regions of Bφ are generally
well separated in space. The dissipation for these ﬁelds is larger for the lower
panel where ﬁelds of opposite sign are squeezed towards the equator. For
non-zero ω the location of the ﬂux changes over the cycle, and at log ω = 2.6
the ﬁeld represents a smoothed version of the two eigenfunctions. Fewer
small-scale features are present and the ﬂow performs well as a dynamo
(see Fig. 3). At Rm = 150 the peak frequency for σ1 is log ω ≈ 2.6;
taking T ∼ (δ/d)2 as an approximate timescale for diﬀusion, if δ ∼ d/8 is an
approximate length scale for the small scale features of the eigenfunctions, we
ﬁnd that the timescale for diﬀusion and for the peak ﬂow oscillation coincide.
The magnetic ﬁeld is then smoothed eﬀectively. Above this frequency the
growth rate decreases again as the ﬁeld is unable to respond to rapid changes
in the ﬂow. Spatial smoothing is lost and the ﬁeld is close to steady — plots
at the two times for log ω = 2.9 are almost identical. The ﬁeld responds as
though to a steady ﬂow, retaining the stronger (smaller-scale) features from
each eigenfunction.

Figure 5 shows growth rates for an orbit about the point (0.5, −0.15),
marked B in Fig. 1, which lies on the lower boundary of the region of suc-
cessful steady dynamos. D remains constant and M varies to carry the ﬂow
outside the dynamo region. The time-dependent ﬂow produces a positive
eﬀect on the growth rate. The spatial structure of the eigenvectors on this
orbit is similar to that of the previous point considered, with well separated
regions of positive and negative azimuthal ﬁeld. For Rm = 150 there is
dynamo action only for frequencies log ω ≈ 2.6, and the average growth rate
around the orbit is negative.

8

We now describe a case where meridional circulation is greater than
diﬀerential rotation, (D, M ) = (−0.10, −0.45), marked C in Fig. 1. This
point is close to where the critical magnetic Reynolds number for steady
ﬂows is at a global minimum. Once again time dependence of the ﬂow
enhances the growth rate, Fig. 6. A small rise can be seen in the growth rate,
although less signiﬁcant relative to the increase associated with an increase
in the magnetic Reynolds number. Being close to the point where Rc
m is
a minimum, the ﬁelds are already relatively large scale and the smoothing
eﬀect of oscillations therefore has a smaller eﬀect on the growth rate.

Growth of the time-dependent solutions is not always found to be better
than the mean of the growth rates on the orbit. Figure 7 shows the case
(D, M ) = (0.50, 0.11), marked D in Fig. 1, where oscillations in the ﬂow are
initially damaging to the dynamo. If the oscillations are suﬃciently rapid,
however, the dynamo is again able to perform better. Meridional sections are
shown in Fig. 8. The regions of strongest ﬂux are located very close together
on the equator. Over the cycle radial shifts of the clover-leaf pattern of ﬂux
causes considerable overlap of opposite signs. This occurs mostly towards
the outer edge of the equatorial region. As the ﬂow oscillates, in the lower
plot for log ω = 2.13 it can be seen that there is cancellation of ﬂux in the
outer region. Some ﬂux remains at the other regions where the signs for the
two eigenfunctions do correlate. This cancellation of ﬂuxes over the cycle
leads to reduced growth rates. When the oscillation is much faster, however,
the dynamo does not have time to generate ﬂux of opposing sign. The ﬁeld
is more steady for log ω = 2.60 and has a larger growth rate.

The radial ﬁeld in the above has little structure of interest. It is con-
centrated mainly on the axis with opposite sign in each hemisphere (see I,
Fig. 9a,b). The structure does not change appreciably over the cycles. In
strength, however, it is observed to wax and wane.

3.2 Dynamo wave solutions

Meridional circulation has been seen to play a key part in reversals. Sarson and Jones
(1999) have studied a system in which irregular reversals are linked to a
drop in meridional circulation, leading to a preference for oscillatory ﬁelds.
Wicht and Olsen (2004) have recently studied a reversal mechanism that
involves an advection of reversed ﬂux by a large-scale S1 ﬂow. Reversals oc-
cur quasi-periodically in their model. This behaviour may be related to the
dynamo wave solutions obtained in III. The oscillation has the form of a dy-
namo wave in which ﬂux migrates along the longitudes deﬁned by the down-
wellings of the convective parts of the ﬂow, which could partially explain
the observed tendency for virtual geomagnetic poles to track around the
Paciﬁc during polarity transition (Gubbins and Sarson, 1994). The steady
ﬂow model can only oscillate periodically, but we can construct a more geo-
physically realistic reversal by choosing a time-dependent ﬂow that traces

9

an orbit in (D, M )-space that strays into the dynamo wave region, depicted
by the line E in Fig. 1, for a fraction f of its period. The ﬁeld behaviour
will depend on the frequency of the dynamo wave, ωD and the time spent
by the ﬂow in the oscillatory regime. If ω ≫ f ωD the ﬂow will only spend a
brief time in the oscillatory regime and we expect only a minor change in the
magnetic ﬁeld. If ω ≪ f ωD the ﬂow spends a long time in the oscillatory
regime and we expect the ﬁeld to oscillate several times before becoming
steady again. The interesting case is when ω ≈ f ωD, when the ﬁeld may
only have time to oscillate for one or a half cycle, producing an excursion
or a reversal respectively.

We now explore reversal behaviour using periodic ﬂows. The structure
of the eigenfunctions for steady ﬂows changes appreciably as M crosses zero.
It was seen in the previous section that, where this is the case, ﬂuctuations
are not necessarily good for the dynamo.
Instead, an orbit is chosen to
enter the oscillatory range from the negative side. Consider the ﬂow de-
ﬁned by ﬁxed D = 0.7 and M varying sinusoidally between −0.0140 and
−0.0020 (E in Fig. 1). This orbit spends approximately one third of the
time within the band of oscillatory solutions reported in III, which lies be-
tween M = −0.0057 and −0.0010. The dynamo wave frequency for steady
ﬂows increases with Rm and appears to saturate at about ℑ(σ) = 17 (see
III, Figs 2,3); it appears to be limited by the diﬀusion time. Here, ω for
the time-dependent ﬂow must be chosen comparable with this frequency to
give a single reversal, a value which is too low to assist the dynamo action
signiﬁcantly.

Figure 9 shows the the growth rate for the time dependent ﬂows as
a function of frequency ω. At Rm = 700, ℑ(σ) is approximately 10 for
steady ﬂows in the oscillatory range. Reversing solutions may be expected
for T f & π/ℑ(σ), or equivalently ω . 20/3, log ω . 0.8 as the time in the
oscillatory range is approximately one third of the cycle. Reversing solutions
(dashed curve) are observed for ω larger than the dynamo wave frequency,
although growth rates fall quickly when the period of the ﬂow oscillation
is too short to be compatible with the period of the oscillatory solution. If
the time within the oscillatory region leads to only a half-complete reversal,
the ﬁeld exiting the region bears little resemblance to the entering ﬁeld,
which is much like the eigenfunction for these low ω, and therefore leads
to reduced growth rates. For greater ω the ﬁeld does not spend suﬃcient
time within the oscillatory region to reverse (solid curve) and at higher ω
the growth rates are increased. The magnetic energy for a typical reversing
solution is plotted in Fig. 10, showing a drop as the solution passes through
the oscillatory region where the reversal occurs. It is possible to vary M so
that f is less than a third. However, for the reversing solution in Fig. 10,
the smooth growth rate curve, while outside the oscillatory region, indicates
the ﬁeld quickly becomes independent of the period within the oscillatory
region, apart from in sign, due to the slow period of the ﬂow oscillation.

10

The reversal sequence for Br at the surface is shown in Fig. 11. Patches
of reversed ﬂux appear at low latitudes, strengthen and migrate polewards
replacing the ﬂux at high latitudes. The reversal looks very similar to that
reported by Gubbins and Sarson (1994) who found the pole paths during
the reversal correlate well with the longitudes of these ﬂux patches, located
180◦ apart. If the frequency of the oscillation is too high the ﬁeld is simply
disrupted by the short period in the oscillatory region, as seen in the energy
in Fig. 10. This may lead to the type behaviour seen in geomagnetic excur-
sions. Figure 12 shows that reversed patches emerge but have insuﬃcient
time to migrate polewards before dissipating. They still still weaken the
dipole, however.

4 Conclusions

We have devised a new matrix-free Krylov subspace approach to solving the
time-dependent stability problem that is most eﬀective in exploring kine-
matic dynamo action of periodic ﬂows. It is computationally eﬃcient, uses
far less storage than conventional methods, and requires rather little new
coding once time-step and eigenvalue routines are available.

Time variation of the ﬂow can sometimes, but not always, enhance dy-
namo action. At low frequency the growth rate of the time dependent ﬂow
approaches the average growth rate for the steady ﬂows along the orbit. At
moderate frequency the time dependent ﬂow can smooth out any concentra-
tions of magnetic ﬂux generated by the component steady ﬂows. This can
produce enhanced dynamo action (higher growth rate than the average) if
the ﬂux concentrations are isolated and of one sign. Dynamo action is possi-
ble at certain frequencies even when the average growth rate for steady ﬂows
around the cycle is negative and the cycle contains mainly steady ﬂows that
do not generate magnetic ﬁeld. The growth rate appears to be capped by
the highest growth rate of any steady ﬂow on the cycle. At high frequency
the magnetic ﬁeld does not have time to adjust to time changes in the ﬂow
and becomes almost stationary.

Time variation does not always enhance dynamo action. When the gen-
erated ﬁeld has ﬂux concentrations of diﬀerent signs close together, the
smoothing eﬀect tends to destroy ﬂux. The dynamo enhancement for these
large scale ﬂows is not as dramatic as those reported by Gog et al. (1999).
Flows with similar eigenfunctions tend to have similar growth rates at the
same Rm, limiting the eﬀect of the time variation. Where the eigenfunction
changes dramatically dynamo action is usually impaired unless the period
of the ﬂow is short compared with the diﬀusion time.

Solutions have been found that reverse when M is low and are associ-
ated with the steady-ﬂow oscillatory solutions found in II. This result is in
common with the reversals studied by Sarson and Jones (1999), which oc-

11

cur irregularly due to a drop in meridional circulation. Although ﬂows in
their calculations are also predominantly equatorial antisymmetric, a small
but increased ﬂow across the equator is observed during a reversal.
It is
unclear that this results in suﬃcient advection of ﬂux to inﬂuence their re-
versal mechanism. A large circulation exterior to the tangent cylinder is
required in the reversal mechanism studied by Wicht and Olsen (2004). It
is needed to transport reversed ﬂux originating from plumes that protrude
the tangent cylinder. However, it is diﬃcult to decipher what part ﬂuc-
tuations would play in their model, and in particular to what degree this
would aﬀect the quasi-regularity of their reversals. We have shown that for
a reversal to occur the drop in M must persist long enough for the ﬁeld
to reverse, which for this class of ﬂows this is approximately a tenth of a
diﬀusion time, or approximately the dipole decay time. A signiﬁcant drop
in magnetic energy is observed during the reversal. This arises because of
the change in eigenfunction between the steady and oscillatory modes of the
steady solutions.

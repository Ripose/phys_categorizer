We propose a mechanism for the low frequency electromagnetic emissions and other electro-
magnetic phenomena which have been associated with earthquakes. The mechanism combines the
critical earthquake concept and the concept of crust acting as a charging electric battery under
increasing stress. The electric charges are released by activation of dormant charge carriers in the
oxygen anion sublattice, called peroxy bonds or positive hole pairs (PHP), where a PHP represents
an O3X/OO\Y O3 with X, Y = Si4+, Al3+..., i.e. an O
of silicates. We propose
that PHP are activated by plastic deformations during the slow cooperative build-up of stress and
the increasingly correlated damage culminating in a large “critical” earthquake. Recent laboratory
experiments indeed show that stressed rocks form electric batteries which can release their charge
when a conducting path closes the equivalent electric circuit. We conjecture that the intermittent
and erratic occurrences of EM signals are a consequence of the progressive build-up of the battery
charges in the Earth crust and their erratic release when crack networks are percolating throughout
the stressed rock volumes, providing a conductive pathway for the battery currents to discharge.
EM signals are thus expected close to the rupture, either slightly before or after, that is, when
percolation is most favored.

INTRODUCTION

We ﬁrst present a short review of the hypothesis proposed by the ﬁrst author and his co-authors that electric
charges are activated in rocks as stress increases, making the crust an electric battery which can discharge. The
discharge currents may lead to electromagnetic (EM) emissions associated with the closing of the electric circuit by
the percolation of conducting paths most probably occurring around the time of (before, during and after) large
earthquakes. We then brieﬂy review the critical earthquake concept proposed some time ago by the second author
and his co-authors, which views large earthquakes as the culmination of a growing collective organization of damage
similar to a critical phase transition (see the recent review (Sornette, 2005) for its description in the context of material
rupture). We then combine the two concepts to propose an explanation for why powerful low frequency EM emissions
would become observable under certain conditions but remain unobservable in other cases. Eftaxias et al. have
previously found that EM signals reveal characteristic signs of an approaching critical point (Eftaxias et al., 2002;
2004; Kapiris et al., 2004; Contoyiannis et al., 2005). Here, we continue along this line of thought by proposing a
speciﬁc mechanism for electric charge generation at the basis of EM emissions, which is combined with the theory of a
critical organization of the crust before large earthquakes. This allows us to suggest some observational consequences
for EM precursors of earthquakes.

INCIPIENT DAMAGE, PEROXY BONDS AND POSITIVES HOLES

Recent work has brought forth evidence of electric signatures associated with mechanical disturbances (Freund,

2000; Freund et al., 2006). These experiments have led to the following understanding that we brieﬂy summarize.

The ﬁrst step is to recognize that electronic charge carriers exist in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks in
a dormant, electrically inactive form. These charge carriers are defect electrons in the oxygen anion sublattice, also
known as positive holes, and their dormant precursors are positive hole pairs (PHP). Among the mechanisms that

2

activate the PHPs and generate the highly mobile positive holes are processes that are expected to occur on a large
scale in rock volumes experiencing an increasing stress due to tectonic forces. The two main processes are plastic
ﬂow and microfracturing, both that are thought to occur ubiquitously in the earth crust. During plastic deformation
that underlies plastic ﬂow, dislocations, which sweep through the crystal structures of the constituent minerals, pass
through PHPs and cause them instently to release positive hole charge carriers. The stress ﬁeld associated with
microfractures can cause additional activation of PHPs within the surrounding microvolume. In a rock experiencing
massive compressive stress such as in thrust setting characteristic of subduction zones or in shear zones under global
tectonic forces, these processes are predicted to lead to a large-scale activation of positive hole charge carriers that
would ﬂow out of the “source volume”. Both, plastic deformation and microfracturing of rocks are expected to mark
the on-going preparation of rock deformation towards global failure, i.e. prior to initiation of an earthquake.

Let us now step back for a while to justify the key role that PHP, we believe, play in the signature of large damage
processes. Martens et al. (1976) reported early that hydroxyl pairs in a model mineral, M gO, converted to molecular
H2 while oxidizing two regular lattice oxygen anions from the 2- to the 1- state, hence to peroxy:

OH + OH ⇔ H2 + O2

2 .

This redox conversion was conﬁrmed spectroscopically (Freund and Wengeler, 1982) and through electrical conduc-
tivity and dielectric polarization studies (Freund et al., 1993). The same redox conversion was found in olivine which,
though nominally anhydrous, contains traces of “water” in form of hydroxyl, O3XOH, where X = Si4+, Al3+, and
so on (Freund and Oberheuser, 1986). It has long been recognized that all nominally anhydrous minerals (meaning
nearly all minerals in common igneous rocks) contain traces of dissolved “water” (Bell and Rossman, 1992; Martin
and Wyss, 1975; Rossman, 1996; Smyth et al., 1991 and revue of Sornette, 1999). What had not been recognized is
that XOH pairs in these minerals appear to undergo the same redox reaction as OH pairs in M gO, giving rise to
peroxy links:

O3XOH...HOXO3 ⇔ H2 + O3X/OO\XO3 .

This reaction occurs below 400 − 500◦C. The geoscience community at large has not yet taken notice of this redox
conversion. One of the prime reason seems to be the assumption that oxygen is never in any other oxidation state but
2-. Accepting the possibility of oxygen in the 1- oxidation state in peroxy links opens a road towards understanding
earthquake-related electrical phenomena.

Peroxy and positive holes (positive electronic charge carriers) are defect electrons or “holes.” When occurring in
the O2 sublattice of oxides or silicate minerals, they are called “positive holes” or p-holes for short and designated h∗.
Chemically, a positive hole is an O. While an O is a radical, two O can stabilize by pairing and tying an OO bond.
An OO bond is a peroxy link, O3X/OO\Y O3 with X, Y = Si4+, Al3+ and so on. As we have said, in physical terms,
a peroxy link is a positive hole pair (PHP).

Magmatic and high-grade metamorphic rocks consist primarily or entirely of nominally anhydrous minerals that
crystallized or recrystallized in H2O-laden environments.
Invariably, such minerals incorporate small amounts of
H2O. The dissolved water occurs in form of hydroxyls, e.g. as OH or XOH (Bell and Rossman, 1992; Martin and
Wyss, 1975; Rossman, 1996; Smyth et al., 1991):

−

(H2O)dissolved + (X/O\Y )structure ⇔ (X/OH

A major fraction of these hydroxyls is believed to undergo this particular redox conversion by which OH − or X − OH
pairs rearrange so as to reduce two H + to H2 and oxidize two O2− to O− which tie a peroxy link:

Even minerals that come from highly reducing crustal and upper mantle environments and contain reduced transition
metal cations can acquire peroxy. This may appear paradoxical but peroxy and reduced transition metals are not
mutually exclusive. This is because the redox conversion takes place during cooling, at relatively low temperatures,
below 400−500◦C. At these low temperatures, all major solid state processes are frozen and non-equilibrium conditions
prevail (Kathrein et al., 1984; Sornette, 1999).

Basic information about PHP’s and positive hole charge carriers, h∗, was obtained by studying M gO, theoretically
(King and Freund, 1984) and experimentally by dc conductivity, dielectric polarization (Freund et al., 1993), thermal

3

expansion, refractive index measurements etc.
(Freund et al., 1994) and fracture experiments (Dickinson et al.,
1986). Information about PHP’s in upper mantle olivine was derived from dielectric polarization and fracture mass
spectroscopy experiments (Freund and Ho, 1996). Peroxy links in fused SiO2 were studied theoretically by Edwards
and Fowler (1982) and Ricci et al. (2001), and experimentally by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (Friebele
et al., 1979) and dielectric polarization (Freund et al., 1993). Fracture experiments with M gO crystals suggested
that the stress ﬁelds and the acoustic waves emitted during fracture activate h∗ charge carriers (Dickinson et al.,
1986; Freund et al., 2002). Recent experiments using slow velocity impacts have shown the validity of the concept
that PHPs are activated under the eﬀect of time-dependent stresses (Freund, 2002). The experiments used steel
ball bearings impacting at 100 m/sec on quartz-free gabbro (≈ 80% plagioclase, ≈ 20% pyroxene) and low-quartz
diorite cut to cylindrical cores. Sensors using magnetic pick-up coils, photodiodes, capacitive sensors and contact
electrodes clearly demonstrated the appearance of positive carriers that were created by the impact. The conditions
under impact resemble those experienced microscopically by the mineral grains in a large rock volume that is slowly
compressed with intermittent damage. Though the overall stress change may be small, the strain will tend to discharge
“explosively” on the microscopic scale by bursts of dislocation movements and microfractures that open and close on
short time scales. These bursts, though numerous, occur distributed over time and space. Another recent experiment
by Freund et al. (2006) shows that, when stress is applied to one end of a block of igneous rocks, two currents ﬂow
out of the stressed rock volume. One current is carried by electrons and it ﬂows out through a Cu electrode directly
attached to the stressed rock volume. The other current is carried by p-holes, i.e. defect electrons on the oxygen
anion sublattice, and it ﬂows out through at least 1 m of unstressed rock. The two currents are coupled via their
respective electric ﬁelds and ﬂuctuate. Evidence of these two types of currents include the positive sign of the charges
accumulating on the rock surface which can be directly measured. In sum, the stressed rock volume acts as a genuine
electric battery, which can discharge only when the two poles are connected via a conductor, i.e., when the electric
circuit is closed on itself.

Dry rocks are usually good insulators but become p-type semiconductors as a consequence of the break-up of
the peroxy bonds. The p-hole charge carriers have not been recognized earlier probably due to the fact that a
h∗ is (chemically speaking) an O− which is highly oxidizing and reacts with any reduced gas and is thus thermally
annihilated. All the studies on the electrical conductivity of minerals and rocks noticed the unusually high conductivity
in the 400 − 600◦C window but assumed it away as a result of surface contamination; indeed, in all these studies, the
anomaly was eliminated by annihilating the h∗ charge carriers by “equilibrating” their minerals and rocks for long
time in reduced gas until the conductivity returned to “normal”!

Applying the insight gained from these laboratory experiments (Freund, 2002; Freund et al., 2006) to the ﬁeld,
where large volume of rocks are subjected to ever increasing stress, has led us to suggest the existence of transient,
ﬂuctuating currents of considerable magnitude that could build up in the Earth’s crust prior to major earthquakes.
An important problem however is to understand how large scale currents can develop and under what circumstances.
For this up-scaling purpose, we propose the critical earthquake model, that we now brieﬂy review before combining
it with the “battery” hypothesis.

THE CRITICAL-EARTHQUAKE MODEL

As often in earthquake physics, we face the challenge of up-scaling, i.e., the transition from the laboratory scale to
the scale of the Earth crust. In order to explain EM signals which appear at large scales, it seems necessary to identify
global signatures of the cooperative damage occurring at small scales. This leads us to proposing the relevance of the
critical-earthquake model. We emphasize that a local analysis is inherently incompatible with the critical earthquake
hypothesis. The problem is similar to the prediction of incipient failure in materials in the laboratory or in engineering
structures (Anifrani et al., 1995; Johansen and Sornette, 2000): only by integrating the information on many damaged
elements can one develop eﬃcient diagnostic for failure (Andersen and Sornette, 2005; Sornette and Andersen, 2006),
in contrast with the detailed description of individual cracking events which are like the trees hiding the forest.
Here, we describe a physical mechanism that converts damage at the micro-scale into electric signals, such that the
cooperative and progressive damage occurring over a large spatial region preceding the main shock should translate
into large-scale observable electro-magnetic signatures.

We start with a cartoon of the mechanical processes occurring under stress , ﬁrst on a small scale of individual grains,
then on a larger scale within the crust taking into account the variation of essential parameters such as temperature,
ductility and electrical conductivity. Figure 1 shows schematically the response of a cube of rock, conﬁned within a
larger rock volume and subjected to increasing stress, (a) if the sample is brittle, and (b) if the sample is ductile.

If a brittle sample is subjected to stress beyond its elastic limit, the deformations become nonlinear. On an atomic

4

scale, dislocations move and new dislocations are generated. As the dislocations per unit volume become ever more
numerous, they begin to coalesce, leading to microfractures. As the microfractures become ever more numerous, they
too coalesce leading to larger cracks. These larger cracks will eventually lead to catastrophic failure.

In a ductile sample, the dislocations anneal as fast as they are generated under stress. The result is plastic ﬂow
without microfractures and, hence, without cracks and catastrophic failure. It is important to note, however, that
even a ductile material can become brittle and develop fractures, if the stresses reach very high values. The reason
is that the brittle-ductile transition is controlled by two time-dependent process: by the rate at which dislocations
are generated and by the rate at which dislocations anneal. If, at high stress rates, more dislocations are generated
per unit time and unit volume than can be annealed, dislocations can pile up and coalesce even in a ductile material,
leading to microfractures and cracks. This is graphically represented on the right hand side of Figure 1b.

In Figure 2, we extend this small-scale concept to the large scale of the Earth’s crust and include one important
electrical parameter: the fact that rocks in the cool upper crust tend to be ever so slightly p-type conducting but
turn n-type conducting deeper into the crust when the temperatures reach or exceed 500 − 600◦ (Freund, 2003). In
the upper left of Figure 2, we show a cross section through two crustal blocks which we assume to have collided at
time t0 along the dashed line. The two blocks comprise the cool, brittle upper crust and the increasingly hot, ductile
mid- to lower crust. We further assume that, due to tectonic forces, the two blocks are being pushed against each
other at a constant speed (constant strain). Also shown within the blocks are two cross-hatched zone: one where the
rocks change from brittle to ductile and another one where their conductivity changes from p-type to n-type.

In Figure 2a, we show that the strain increases linearly with time. In Figure 2b we plot in a simpliﬁed way strain
versus stress. In the elastic range, the strain is linear with stress. In the inelastic range, which is of interest here,
the strain, i.e. deformation, increases non-linearly, due to the generation and movement of dislocations. Eventually,
under the onslaught of continuing deformation at a constant strain rate, stress increases even more rapidly and the
system becomes mechanically unstable. In Figure 2c we plot, again schematically, how the viscosity changes with
increasing depth and, hence, with increasing temperature. The deeper we go into the crust, the more the temperature
increases. Hence, the rocks become ever more ductile. The brittle to ductile transition is marked by a cross-hatched
region. However, the position of the brittle-to-ductile transition zone is not ﬁxed. The reason is, as explained in the
context of Figure 1b, a ductile response at low stress levels (slow deformation) may turn into a brittle response when
high levels of stress are applied (rapid deformation).

Finally, in Figure 2d, we combine the information derived from Figures 2a-c with the representation of two crustal
blocks colliding at a constant speed. In Figure 2d, we plot the deformation volume versus time, i.e. the rock volume
that reaches a certain level of deformation as time progresses. We can arbitrarily choose as the level of deformation the
on-set of microfracturing as depicted in Figure 1a. Because of the non-linear increase of stress (Figure 2b), combined
with the decrease in viscosity (Figure 2c), we know that the deformation volume, which satisﬁes this condition, will
expand outward and downward with increasing stress as indicated by the white lines in the two-block model (Ashby
and Jones, 1980; Frost and Ashby, 1982; Nechad et al., 2005). The points t0, t1 and t2 on the time axis of Figure 2d
mark the initial stress build-up. We assume that the deformation volume reaches the transition zone from brittle to
ductile at t3 and the transition zone from p-type to n-type behavior at t4.

While we expect the brittle-to-ductile transition zone to move downward in the crust when stresses become high and
deformations become rapid, the transition from p-type to n-type is controlled by temperature only and independent of
the stress level (Freund 2003). Thus, we can envision situations where, with ever increasing stress levels, the transition
to a ductile behavior is pushed deeper and deeper into the crust. This would allow the zone of brittle fracturing to
extend downward, eventually overlapping with the zone where the rocks become pervasively n-type. At this point,
we believe, a crucial electrical connection is made which enables the electrons in the battery, i.e. in the stressed rock
volume, to massively ﬂow downward and create a condition where the p-hole currents follow suit by also ﬂowing out
massively.

Uncorrelated percolation (Stauﬀer and Aharony, 1992) provides a starting modeling point valid in the limit of very
large disorder (Roux et al., 1988). For realistic systems, long-range correlations transported by the stress ﬁeld around
defects and cracks make the problem much more subtle. Time dependence is expected to be a crucial aspect in the
process of correlation building in these processes. As the damage increases, a new “phase” appears, where micro-cracks
begin to merge leading to screening and other cooperative eﬀects. This should lead to an overall acceleration of the
seismicity at large scales. However, by the very nature of the damage processes, this acceleration is expected to be
very intermittent and strongly ﬂuctuating from case to case. This is one of the reasons why it is diﬃcult to establish
with reliable statistical signiﬁcance the existence of strong seismic precursors. With respect to both mechanical and
electric (and therefore electro-magnetic) precursors, the big unknown is still the role of water in gouge-ﬁlled faults or
aquifers. In addition, given the complexity of the crust, large-scale processes will most likely be inﬂuenced as well by
factors such as the types of rocks in the stressed volume. Finally, the main fracture is formed causing global failure.

This scenario is very diﬀerent from the nucleation model (Dieterich, 1992), which envisions instead a local preparation
or nucleation zone with a typical size of meters to maybe a few kilometers at most. Within the nucleation model,
precursors are not expected to occur over very large spatial regions.

The idea, that great earthquakes could be “critical” events in a technical sense of the term explained below, is
gaining momentum in the geophysical community, even if it is far from proven as its consequences are still debated.
The critical earthquake model provides an original view of the organization of the crust prior to great earthquakes
that, as we shall see, allows one to explain several paradoxical observations, which pose problem within the nucleation
model (Dieterich, 1992).

The word “critical” describes a system at the boundary between order and disorder, that is characterized by both
extreme susceptibility to external factors and long-range correlations between diﬀerent parts of the system (Sornette,
2004). Examples of such systems are magnets close to their Curie point, where the system progressively orders
under small external changes. Critical behavior is fundamentally a cooperative phenomenon, resulting from the
repeated interactions between “microscopic” elements which progressively “phase up” and construct a “macroscopic”
self-similar state.

This idea can be traced back to the critical branching model of Vere-Jones (1977) and to the percolation model
of rupture using the real-space renormalization group approach (All`egre et al., 1982). The Russian school has also
extensively developed this concept (see (Keilis-Borok, 1990) and references therein). Sornette and Sornette (1990) and
Sornette and Sammis (1995) identiﬁed speciﬁc measurable signatures of the predicted critical behavior in terms of a
time-to-failure power-law acceleration of physical properties such as electric precursors (Sornette and Sornette, 1990)
or the Benioﬀ strain, previously interpreted diﬀerently with empirical mechanical-damage laws (Sykes and Jaum´e,
1990; Bufe and Varnes, 1993).

The critical-earthquake concept has been further strengthened by showing that a strong heterogeneity of the elastic
and/or failure properties of rocks is necessary for a critical behavior of rupture to occur (Andersen et al., 1997;
Heimpel, 1997; Sornette and Andersen, 1998; Lei et al., 2000; 2004). This was anticipated early by Mogi (1969),
who noticed that, for experiments on a variety of materials, the larger the disorder, the stronger and more useful are
the precursors to rupture. In a heterogeneous material, the fracture behavior will be determined by the block that
is most brittle and fails in a catastrophic way. The disorder may not need to be only frozen (pre-existing) as it may
be generated during the deformation processes (Bouchaud and Mezard, 1994), in particular in the transition from
the generation/movement of dislocations to coalescence/microfracturing. Numerical simulations have conﬁrmed that,
near the global failure point, the cumulative elastic energy released during fracturing of heterogeneous solids with
long-range elastic interactions exhibit a critical behavior with observable log-periodic corrections (Sahimi and Arbati,
1996; Johansen and Sornette, 1998; Zhou and Sornette, 2002). Recent experiments measuring acoustic emissions
associated with the rupture of ﬁber-glass composites (Garcimartin et al., 1997; Moura and Yukalov, 2002; Yukalov et
al., 2004, Nechad et al., 2005), on kevlar and carbon ﬁber composites (Johansen and Sornette, 2000) and on rocks (Lei
et al., 2003; Moura et al., 2005) have conﬁrmed the critical scenario. Sammis and Sornette (2002) have generalized
the “critical point” concept for large earthquakes in the framework of so-called “ﬁnite-time singularities,” and have
proposed that the singular behavior associated with accelerated seismic release results from a positive feedback of
the seismic activity on its release rate. The most important mechanisms for such positive feedback include (i) stress
load in subcritical crack growth, (ii) geometrical eﬀects in creep rupture, (iii) weakening by damage, (iv) stress
redistribution in a percolation model of asperity failures and (v) fragmentation of the stress-shadow (cast by the last
large earthquake) by the increasing tectonic stress. The critical-earthquake model has also been tested with positive
results on rockbursts occurring in deep South African mines (Ouillon and Sornette, 2000), thus oﬀering an example
with an intermediate range of scales between the laboratory and the earth crust.

As predicted by the critical earthquake model, there are many reported observations of increased intermediate
magnitude seismicity before large events (Ellsworth et al., 1981; Jones, 1994; Keilis-Borok et al., 1988; Knopoﬀ et
al., 1996; Lindh, 1990; Main, 1996; Mogi, 1969; Raleigh et al., 1982; Sykes and Jaum´e, 1990; Tocher, 1959). Because
these precursory events occur over an area much greater than is predicted for elasto-dynamic interactions, they are
not considered to be classical foreshocks (Jones and Molnar, 1979). While the observed long-range correlations in
seismicity can not be explained by simple elasto-dynamic interactions, they can be understood by analogy to the
statistical mechanics of a system approaching a critical point for which the correlation length is only limited by the
size of the system (Wilson, 1979). There are large ﬂuctuations of the precursory seismicity from event to event.
Therefore, the statistical signiﬁcance of these precursors has not yet been established ﬁrmly (Huang et al., 2000,
Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003). Another ingredient for large scale correlations of the precursory signals is that the
tectonic plates are being moved or dragged along by large-scale mantle convections and, hence, stresses act coherently
on large sections of the crust.

If the crust does behave such that larger earthquakes are “critical” events, stress correlation lengths should grow

6

in the lead-up to large events and drop sharply once these occur. In the critical model, a large or great earthquakes
dissipates a suﬃcient proportion of the accumulated regional strain to destroy these long wavelength stress correlations,
which need to be re-established to prepare for the next big one. According to this model, large earthquakes are not just
scaled-up version of small earthquakes but play a special role as “critical points” (Bowman et al., 1998; Brehm and
Braile, 1999; Jaume and Sykes, 1999). However, this evolution in stress correlation lengths is very diﬃcult to observe
directly. Recently, Mora and Place (2000) have shown, using the lattice solid model to describe discontinuous elasto-
dynamic systems subjected to shear and compression (Mora and Place, 1999; Place et al., 2000), that cumulative
strain and correlation lengths do exhibit a critical evolution in these model systems. Huang et al. (1998) have shown
that the concept of critical earthquake is compatible with the concept of self-organized criticality (Bak and Tang,
1989; Sornette and Sornette, 1989) in a hierarchical structured crust (Ouillon et al., 1996). This has been further
elaborated in terms of the concept of “intermittent criticality” (Bowman and Sammis, 2004; Sammis et al., 2004).

An alternative proposal, called the Stress Accumulation model sees the accelerating seismicity sequences as resulting
from the tectonic loading of large fault structures through aseismic slip in the elasto-plastic lower crust (Bowman
and King, 2001; 2003; Levin et al., 2006). According to this view, the upper crust could be driven in signiﬁcant part
from below (lower crust and mantle) with its associated plastic and plastic-ductile localization controlling in part the
organization of faulting (Regenauer-Lieb and Yuen, 2003) and of seismicity in the upper crust. According to this
view, major earthquakes would reﬂect this tectonic driving, while triggered earthquakes would be mostly “witnesses”
(and relatively minor “actors”) of the physics of stress redistribution and delayed rupture nucleation (according to
stress corrosion, damage theory and/or state and velocity dependent friction).

We think that reality is probably a mixture of critical damage build-up and stress accumulation due to the lower
crust loading. While it seems unrealistic to neglect (as often done) the strength of the plastic and plastic-ductile lower
crust and its mechanical coupling with the upper brittle crust, it also seems that rupture in highly heterogeneous
rocks does occur generically according to the critical rupture scenario. The important point for our purpose is that
both mechanisms combine to produce large scale coherent stress loading and damage processes.

PUTTING TOGETHER THE ELECTRIC BATTERY AND CRITICAL EARTHQUAKE CONCEPTS FOR
LARGE SCALE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC SIGNATURES

When stress is applied, dislocations that move through the mineral grains cause the PHPs to break up and to release
p-hole charge carriers. The p-holes “live” in the valence band. They travel by passing from oxygen anion to oxygen
anion using energy levels provided at the upper edge of the valence band. Following their concentration gradient
between stressed and unstressed rock, the p-holes spread out of the stressed rock volume. They propagate as charge
waves with an estimated group velocity on the order of 100 − 300 m/s. At the laboratory scale, this phenomenon is
observed as the arrival of a charge cloud building up a concentration of positive charges at the surface of the sample,
with electric ﬁelds of the order of 105 − 106 V/cm. Such high ﬁelds may lead to ﬁeld-ionization of air molecules, the
injection of ions into the air and eventually to corona discharges accompanied by light emissions that have indeed
been measured (Freund, 2000).

Therefore, if there is a large scale region subjected to increasing damage at the microscopic scale, it will act as
a net source of p-holes charge carriers ﬂowing out to the surface and creating a net positive group potential. This
charge accumulation can be counteracted in two ways: (1) by an outﬂow of electrons from the stressed rock volume
and (2) by an inﬂow of protons possibly available from free water present in the crust.
In a steady state, the
two charge ﬂuxes will balance and no net eﬀect should be observed. Also, when no percolating conduction path
exists, the charge accumulation increases as in the charge of a battery with no possibility for conduction. When a
large earthquake becomes incipient, the critical model predicts that the damage should accelerate at the microscopic
scale (which may not be usually detectable by increasing seismicity at observable levels or with other mechanical
signatures), corresponding to an increasingly stronger source of p-holes charge carriers released from the rupture of
peroxy bonds. In these circumstances, one might be able to observe the eﬀects associated with a sudden increase of
outﬂow currents, when the conditions are such that the circuit loop closes on itself allowing p-holes and electrons in
the battery volume to ﬂow out. These p-hole and electron currents are coupled through their respective electric ﬁelds
and, hence, ﬂuctuating. Another eﬀect of the stress activation of these electronic charge carriers is the build-up of a
net positive ground potential over the broad regional areas surrounding an impending large earthquake.

Essentially all the electro-magnetic manifestations reported anecdotically in the literature (Park et al., 1993) can
be rationalized by our theory, once we understand that igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks contain dormant
electronic charge carriers. Stress “awakens” these charge carriers, p-holes and electrons. As a result the stressed rock
volume turns into a battery from where electric currents can ﬂow out. For these currents to ﬂow in any sustained

7

manner, however, certain conditions have to be fulﬁlled. If the build-up of stress occurs somewhere in the cool, brittle
upper to middle crust, the p-holes can always spread out laterally into the surrounding unstressed rocks. By contrast,
the electrons are blocked from entering the surrounding unstressed rocks. They require a conductivity path downward
into the hot, n-type conductive lower crust. Once this downward connection is established, the circuit loop closes
allowing both currents, electrons and p-holes, to ﬂow out. Depending on conditions that are still poorly characterized,
the outﬂows may occur in bursts giving rise to pulses of low-frequency electromagnetic radiation. In addition, the
two outﬂow currents can be expected to couple via the electric ﬁelds that the propagating charges build up. Such a
coupling should give rise to ﬂuctuations, which would be another source of low-frequency electromagnetic emissions.
Our theory also opens the door toward understanding, at least in principle, other pre-earthquake phenomena
that have been widely reported in the literature. Prior to major earthquakes the ionosphere displays remarkable
perturbations (Molchanov et al. 1993; Molchanov and Hayakawa 1998b, c; Alperovich and Fedorov 1999; Chen et al.
1999; Cliverd et al. 1999; Liu et al. 2000, 2001; Pulinets et al. 2000; Sorokin et al. 2001; Pulinets and Boyarchuk
2004). These perturbations extend over large areas, on the order of 500-1000 km. They require changes of the electric
ﬁeld at ground level, strong enough to induce a recognizable reaction in the ionosphere. If the p-hole charge carriers
are able to spread out of a stressed rocks volume in the upper to middle crust, they can be expected to reach the
Earth’s surface. If they get trapped at the surface as laboratory experiments suggest (Freund, et al., 1993; Freund, et
al., 1994), the surface will acquire a positive charge. In the ﬁeld this would be equivalent to a change in the Earth’s
ground potential over the region where the stress accumulation takes place. The Earth-ionosphere system can be
considered a capacitor of which one plate, ﬁxed at the Earth’s surface, becomes positively charged. The ionosphere,
representing the other, ﬂexible plate, will then react and produce a mirror image of the charge accumulation on the
ground.

Other eﬀects derive from the electric ﬁelds that are built up on a microscopic scale at the rock-air interface when
p-holes arrive at the surface. Theory predicts that the p-holes form charge layers at the interface, 10 − 100 nm thick,
with charge densities suﬃcient to produce surface potentials on the order of 0.1 − 1 V (King and Freund, 1984).
Experimentally, surface potentials in the range of 50 mV to 10 − 20 V have been observed (Freund, et al., 2002). The
associated electric ﬁeld, calculated for a ﬂat surface (Freund, 2002), then fall into the range of 5 · 105 − 107 V/cm. At
sharp points, the electric ﬁelds can be expected to reach values high enough to cause ﬁeld ionization of air molecules
at the interface and injection of positive ions into the atmosphere. These processes would in turn be consistent with
dielectric breakdown of the air and with glow or corona discharges, i.e. with luminous phenomena and high-frequency
electromagnetic emissions in the range of tens of kHz.

Yet another widely reported pre-earthquake phenomenon may ﬁnd its physical explanation through a better un-
derstanding of the p-hole charge carriers: the observation that, prior to major earthquakes in semi-arid parts of the
world, large areas of the land surface around the future epicenter tend to emit infrared radiation equivalent to a
temperature increase on the order of 2 − 4◦C (Dey and Singh, 2003; Srivastav, et al., 1997; Tronin, 1996; Tronin, et
al., 2004; Qiang, et al., 1999; Freund, et al., 2006; Ouzounov and Freund, 2004; Liu, et al., 2000; Naaman, et al.,
2001; Ohta, et al., 2001; Ondoh, 1998; Vershinin, et al., 1999; Pulinets, et al., 2005; Trigunait, 2004; Yen, et al.,
2004]. These “thermal anomalies” come and go rapidly. After the earthquake and any aftershocks they disappear. If
p-holes spread out from a stressed rock volume, travel though thick layers of rock and reach the Earth’s surface, they
can be expected to recombine to form peroxy links similar to those that were broken deep below during application
of stress. During hole-hole recombination, energy is released. A consequence of this process would be the formation
of vibrationally excited O-O bonds. These excited bonds can dissipate their excess energy by emitting IR photons
at the characteristic frequencies of the O-O stretching vibration or by transferring energy onto their Si-O and Al-O
neighbors causing them to become excited and to emit at their characteristic frequencies. Laboratory experiments
have produced results that are consistent with this line of reasoning. They show that, when one end of a large block of
rock is subjected to stress, a free surface 50 cm away instantly begins to emit in the infrared. The emission spectrum
is composed of sharp bands at the characteristic frequencies of O-O, Si-O and Al-O vibrations (Freund et al., 2006).
A further piece of evidence for an outﬂow of p-holes from a stressed rock volume is provided by the serendipitous
observation of strong magnetic ﬁeld variations along the 110 km long Chelungpu Fault in Taiwan that ruptured during
the M=7.7 Chi-Chi earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999. For seven week before the main event and for several weeks during
the intense aftershock period, the local magnetometer network recorded rapid, pulse-like variations of the magnetic
ﬁeld, each lasting for several hours (Yen et al., 2004). Telluric currents on the order to 106 Amp would have been
necessary to produce such magnetic ﬁeld excursions (Yen et al., 2004).

Another consequence of our theory is the following. As the crust “battery” produces a current, the outﬂow of
p-holes through the rock is equivalent to electrons hopping back into the stressed rock volume. These electrons
will reconstitute the positive hole pairs inside the stressed rock volume. Therefore, the battery is (theoretically)
inexhaustible: the current can run until the battery is “empty.” As stress is varying in time due to intermittent

8

earthquakes and the slow tectonic loading, the rock again charges up. The battery should be reusable many, many
times, paralleling the many, many seismic cycles over millions of years of a given tectonic plate. In this vein, let
us mention a recent study supporting the idea that electric signals in the crust (ultra-low frequency ground electric
signals from stations operated by the China Seismological Bureau over the last 20 years) have a statistically signiﬁcant
pre-seismic component and are thus linked with the preparatory stage before earthquakes (Zhuang et al., 2005).

An order-of-magnitude estimation, extrapolating from the laboratory at the scale of rock blocks of 1 meter long,
suggests very large currents in the range of thousands to millions of amperes ﬂowing out of the hundreds to thousands of
cubic kilometers of rock, which experience increasing levels of stress prior to the catastrophic rupture. Conceptually,
these strong currents can be concentrated in narrow conducting paths. This begs the question of why we do not
observe these currents and EM radiations more easily. To address this question, recall that our proposed concept is
that of the crust being like a battery being electrically “charged” by the application of stress. Inside the stressed rock
volume, both electrons and defect electrons (p-holes) are activated. The p-holes can spread out into the surrounding
unstressed rocks because p-holes move along the upper edge of the valence band (which is dominated by energy states
of O2s and O2p character). In other words, unstressed rock are (every so slightly) p-type conducting. We believe
that, as a result, p-holes can travel very far. The electrons, however, are stuck inside the stressed rock volume. They
cannot leave it unless an n-type contact is provided, which is easily done in the laboratory by sticking a Cu tape on
the stressed rock volume or using the steel pistons as contacts. In the laboratory, a wire from the stressed rock volume
is run to any place on the unstressed rock, which closes the loop and allows the battery to discharge. Out in nature,
we propose that the n-type contact can be provided by rocks deeper in the crust that exceed ∼ 500◦C and thereby
become n-type conductive. Another possibility is through the percolation of fractures ﬁlled with small amounts of
conductive brine, which is expected to occur close to the critical point. Therefore, the answer to the question, “why
we don’t “see” powerful currents more often and more easily”, is that the battery is there, ready to release hundreds
of thousands of amperes per km3, but the electric loop is normally not closed. The loop closes only, when massive
stresses build up that reach from the upper crust down to the hot lower crust or when damage percolates through a
conductive path, closing the electric circuit.

Our theory is falsiﬁable (Kagan, 1999) as it makes speciﬁc tests that can be refuted. Our prefered crucial test
would consist in deploying a large array of stations capable of measuring the potential diﬀerence of the crust at the
scale of tens of kilometers or more. To the best of our knowledge, such measurements have never been done before
but constitute one of the best probe for detecting anomalous accumulation of positive charges at locations related to
large inpending earthquakes.

FIG. 1: Brittle and ductile response at the level of small rock volumes. (a) Increasing stress in the brittle regime causes
dislocation movement, coalescence of dislocations to microfractures and merging of microfractures to cracks. (b) Increasing
stress in the ductile regime causes plastic deformation but, if the stresses become very high, even ductile materials can develop
cracks.

FIG. 2: Cross section through two crustal blocks colliding at a constant speed. (a) Strain versus time. (b) Stress versus time
for a brittle material being deformed at a constant speed. (c) Viscosity decreasing with increasing depth and temperature.
(d) Volume of rock undergoing brittle fracture as a function of time assuming deformation at a constant speed and, hence,
increasing levels of stress.

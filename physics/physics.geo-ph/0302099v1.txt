Abstract. Magma viscosity is strongly temperature-dependent.
When hot magma ﬂows in a conduit, heat is lost through the walls
and the temperature decreases along the ﬂow causing a viscosity
increase. For particular values of the controlling parameters the
steady-ﬂow regime in a conduit shows two stable solutions belong-
ing either to the slow or to the fast branch. As a consequence, this
system may show an hysteresis effect, and the transition between
the two branches can occur quickly when certain critical points are
reached. In this paper we describe a model to study the relation be-
tween the pressure at the inlet and the volumetric magma ﬂow rate in
a conduit. We apply this model to explain an hysteric jump observed
during the dome growth at Soufri`ere Hills volcano (Montserrat), and
described by Melnik and Sparks [1999] using a different model.

1. Introduction

Like other liquids of practical interest (e.g. polymers, oils),
magma has a strong temperature-dependent viscosity.
It is well
known that the ﬂow in conduits of this kind of ﬂuids admits one or
more solutions for different ranges of the controlling parameters.
The problem of the multiple solutions and their stability was stud-
ied by Pearson et al. [1973] and by Aleksanopol’skii and Naidenov
[1979]. More recently this phenomenon, applied to magma ﬂows,
was investigated with more sophisticated models by Helfrich [1995]
and by Wylie and Lister [1995]. In Skul’skiy et al. [1999] a simple
method to ﬁnd the conditions of multiple solutions was adopted and
an experimental study to verify the hysteresis phenomenon predicted
for this process was performed.

2. The model

In this paper we investigate a simple one-dimensional ﬂow model
of a ﬂuid with temperature-dependent viscosity, with the essential
physical properties characterizing the phenomenon of the multiple
solutions and hysteresis as in Skul’skiy et al. [1999]. The ﬂuid ﬂows
in a conduit with constant cross section and constant temperature at
the wall boundaries. We assume that the ﬂuid properties are constant
with the temperature except for the viscosity, and we neglect the heat
conduction along the streamlines, and the viscous heat generation.
Moreover, we assume a linear relation between the shear stress and

the strain rate (Newtonian rheology). This last assumption is intro-
duced to simplify the model and allows us to demonstrate that the
multiple solutions in conduit ﬂows are the direct consequence of
the viscosity increase along the conduit induced by cooling (under
particular boundary conditions). Under these hypotheses, the equa-
tions for momentum and energy balance for the one-dimensional
steady ﬂow in a long circular conduit (R ≪ L) at low Reynolds

mal conductivity, ρ density, µ viscosity, and P pressure, and T
temperature. For magma, the dependence of the viscosity on the
temperature is well described by the Arrhenius law:

µ = µA exp(B/T )

where µA is a constant and B the activation energy. In this paper,
for simplicity, we approximate eq. (3) by the Nahme’s exponential
law, valid when (T − TR)/TR ≪ 1, where TR is a reference tem-
perature:

µ = µR exp [−β(T − TR)]

with β = B/T 2
R and µR = µA exp(B/TR). Following Skul’skiy
et al. [1999], we introduce two new variables: the volumetric ﬂow

In Fig. 1 we plot relation (16) obtained numerically. We observe
that for values of B greater than a critical value Bc ≃ 3, there are
values of p0 which correspond to three different values of q. By us-
ing a simpler model, Skul’skiy et al. [1999] found Bc = 4, whereas
Helfrich [1995] found Bc = 3.03, in good agreement with Pear-
son et al. [1973]. Moreover, Shah and Pearson [1974] showed that
when the viscous heat generation is important, the value of Bc can
be lower, but for high values of B, the relation between p0 and q is
similar to the case without viscous heat generation.

The stability analysis of the three branches (slow, intermediate
and fast) shows that the intermediate branch is never stable. More-
over, one part of the slow branch is stable to two-dimensional pertur-
bations but unstable to the three-dimensional ones, in a way similar
to the Saffman-Taylor instability [Wylie and Lister, 1995]. In the
case of multiple solutions, an hysteresis phenomenon may occur, as
proposed in Wylie and Lister [1995] and veriﬁed experimentally in
Skul’skiy et al. [1999].

In the experiments of Skul’skiy et al. [1999] a ﬂuid with pre-
scribed temperature and pressure was injected into a capillary tube

A typical value of the viscosity is µ0 = µ(T0) = 107 Pa s for
Montserrat andesite at 1123 K with 4% water content [Melnik and
Sparks, 1999]. This value is in good agreement with eq. (17);
in fact, for B = Bbest and assuming Tw ≈ 873 K, we have
w exp (B) ≃ 1.6 × 107 Pa s. Moreover, for B = Bbest
µ0 = µbest
and T0 − Tw ≈ 250 K gives β ≃ 0.014 K−1 (for example, from
data of Hess and Dingwell [1996] for a magma with a similar com-
position and 4% water content, we obtain β ≃ 0.016 K−1). Finally,
for the heat transfer coefﬁcient we have:

α ≈

≈ 4 W m−2 K−1

(18)

k
δT

where δT is the thermal boundary layer of the ﬂow, while using
k = 2 W m−1 K−1, δT ≈ 50 cm (Bruce and Huppert [1989] used
δT ≈ 10 cm for dyke length of about one kilometer).

Moreover, we verify the basic assumptions of the model:
the
assumption of one-dimensional ﬂow is based on the small diame-
−3), and the small Reynold
ter/length ratio of the conduit (R/L ∼ 10

with constant wall temperature and controlled ﬂuid pressure and
ﬂow rate. The device is used to show the transition between the two
regimes corresponding to the upper and the lower branches.

A comparison between the experimental results (crosses) and the-
ory (full line) is shown in Fig. 2 for the nondimensional variables p0
and q, for B = 4.6. The dashed lines indicate the pressure history
prescribed in the experiments. The two steady-state regimes corre-
sponding to the slow and to the fast branch were clearly recorded.
Starting with a low pressure conﬁguration (point A) and by increas-
ing the pressure, the ﬂow rate increases along the slow branch until
it reaches a critical point (point B). Here, a jump to the fast branch
occurs (point C). Increasing the pressure further, the ﬂow rate in-
creases along this branch, whereas, by decreasing the pressure, the
ﬂow rate decreases moving along the upper branch, until it reaches
another critical point (point D) where the jump on the slow branch
occurs (point E). On the slow branch the nondimensional ﬂow rate is
more than one order of magnitude lower than that on the fast branch.

3. Application

During some basaltic ﬁssure eruptions in Hawaii and in Iceland,
the eruption begins with a rapid opening at high ﬂow rate and, after
few hours, the ﬂow rate quickly decreases. To explain this phe-
nomenon, Wylie and Lister [1995] and Helfrich [1995] proposed
a model similar to the model presented in this paper, based on the
hysteric jump between the fast branch and the slow branch when
the pressure driving the eruption decreases.

A similar phenomenon, showing a jump in the mass ﬂow rate,
was observed during the dome growth (1995-1999) at Soufri`ere Hills
volcano in Montserrat as described by Melnik and Sparks [1999].
The model used by Melnik and Sparks [1999] to explain this ef-
fect is essentially based on the crystal growth kinetics which affects
magma viscosity, and the mechanical coupling between the gas and
the melt through the Darcy law.

In this paper we explain the same phenomenon in terms of the
viscosity variation governed by cooling along the ﬂow. However,
since the crystal content is physically related to the magma temper-
ature, the two models are physically related.

Using the data of Tab. 1, we ﬁt the curve of eq. (16) with the
observed values of the discharge rates and dome height reported in
Melnik and Sparks [1999].

The variation of the dome height reﬂects a change of the exit
pressure and, as a consequence, a variation of the difference be-
tween the inlet and the outlet pressures. Since we assume a zero
exit pressure in our model and the gravity term was not explicitly
accounted for in eq. (1), the variable p0 represents the overpressure
at the base of the conduit (to obtain the actual value, the hydrostatic
pressure ρg(L + H) must be added to its value, where L is the
conduit length and H is the dome height).

The values of α, B and µw are chosen by least square best ﬁt-
ting of the observed data, and the wall temperature Tw was deﬁned
as the temperature for which magma ceases to ﬂow. Fig. 3 shows
the results of least square ﬁtting: the discharge rate is reported on
the x-axis and the overpressure on the y-axis. The crosses indicate
the observed values, reported in Melnik and Sparks [1999], and the
dome height expressed in terms of overpressure.

The values obtained by the best ﬁt of the observed data are:

W m−2 K−1

αbest = 3.56

Bbest = 3.46

= 5 × 108 Pa s

(17)

Fig. 3 shows the agreement of the model with the observed data; the
proposed model is able to explain the hysteresis effect observed in
dome growth at Soufriere Hill (Montserrat) by Melnik and Sparks
[1999], and modeled in a different way.

The assumption of negligible heat conduction along the stream-
lines is justiﬁed by the high value of the Peclet number (the ra-
tio between the advective and the conductive heat conduction):
Pe = (ρcpvR)/k ≈ 105.

The existence of the multiple solutions for the steady ﬂow al-
lows the system to show a pulsating behavior between the different
solutions. In the case where the initial pressure, is greater than the
critical pressure corresponding to point E in Fig. 4, the system is on
the fast branch of the solution, such as in point A. If the pressure de-
creases, the system moves along this branch up to the critical point
C. In C a jump to the slow branch occurs (point D). If the pressure
continues to decrease, the discharge rate tends to zero. Instead, if
the pressure increases, the system moves along the slow branch up
to the other critical point E. In this point the jump occurs on the fast
branch and the system reaches point B.

The overpressure conditions and pulsating activity, typical of
dome eruptions, are evident not only at Soufri`ere Hills, but also
in Santiaguito (Guatemala), Mount Unzen (Japan), Lascar (Chile),
Galeras (Colombia) and Mount St. Helens (USA) [Melnik and
Sparks, 1999].

4. Conclusion

Magma ﬂow in conduits shows the existence of multiple solu-
tions, like other ﬂuids with strong temperature dependent viscosity.
This is a consequence of the increase of viscosity along the ﬂow
due to cooling. For a given pressure drop along the conduit, one or
two stable regimes (fast and slow branches) may exist. The tran-
sition between the two branches occurs when critical values are
reached, and an hysteresis phenomenon is possible. These jumps
were evident during the dome growth in the 1995-1999 Soufri`ere
Hills (Montserrat) eruption. The pulsating behaviour of the dome
growth was previously modeled by Melnik and Sparks [1999] in

terms of the nonlinear effects of crystallization and gas loss by per-
meable magma.

In this paper we propose a model to describe the nonlinear jumps
between the two stable solutions as a consequence of the coupling
between the momentum and energy equation induced by the strong
temperature-dependent viscosity of magma.

However, since the crystal content is a consequence of cooling,

the two models, although different, are physically related.

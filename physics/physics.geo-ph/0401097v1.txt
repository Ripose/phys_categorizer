We show, essentially by theoretial means, that for a site with the

hosen simple geometry and mehanial properties (horizontal, homo-

geneous, soft visoelasti layer of in(cid:28)nite lateral extent overlying, and

in welded ontat with, a homogeneous, hard elasti substratum of half-

in(cid:28)nite radial extent, shear-horizontal motion): 1) oupling to Love

modes is all the weaker the farther the seismi soure (modeled as a

line, assumed to lie in the substratum) is from the lower boundary

of the soft layer, 2) for a line soure lose to the lower boundary of

the soft layer, the ground response is haraterized by possible beating

phenomena, and is of signi(cid:28)antly-longer duration than for exitation

by ylindrial waves radiated by deep soures. Numerial appliations

of the theory show, for instane, that a line soure, loated 40m below

the lower boundary of a 60m thik soft layer in a hypothetial Mexio

City-like site, radiating a SH pulse of 4s duration, produes substan-

tial ground motion during 200s, with marked beating, at an epientral

distane of 3km. This response is in some respets similar to that

observed in real ities loated at soft-soil sites so that the model em-

ployed herein may help to establish the auses and pinpoint the ma jor

ontributing fators of the devastating e(cid:27)ets of earthquakes in suh

1 Introdution

wave propagation:

This investigation is relevant to several topis of broad interest in seismi

(a) regional path e(cid:27)ets in onnetion with seismi response in urban

environments [1℄, [2℄, [3℄, [4℄, [5℄, [6℄, [7℄, [8℄, [9℄, [10℄

(b) e(cid:27)ets of the underlying soil heterogeneities, lateral variations of the

underlying soil layer, and built environment on seismi ground response at

various (partiularly urban) sites [11℄, [12℄, [13℄, [6℄, [14℄, [15℄, [16℄, [17℄,[18℄,

() analysis of surfae wave response on the ground to determine the

struture and omposition of the rust [11℄ and underground fault zones

[9℄, [10℄, [19℄

[20℄, [21℄

soures [22℄, [23℄.

(d) analysis of surfae wave response on the ground to identify earthquake

Researh on topi (a) was rekindled by e(cid:27)orts to explain some puzzling

features of the devastating Mihoaan earthquake whih struk Mexio City

in 1985. Other than the fat that the response in downtown Mexio varied

onsiderably in a spatial sense, was quite intense and of very-long duration

[24℄, [25℄ (as muh as ∼3 min) at ertain loations, and often took the form

of a quasi-monohromati signal with beating, a remarkable feature of this

earthquake was that suh strong (in the sense just mentioned) response ould

be aused by a seismi disturbane so far (its epienter was in the subdu-

tion zone o(cid:27) the Pai(cid:28) oast approximately 350 km) from the ity [26℄, [27℄,

[9℄, [10℄. A part of the ause of the large intensity and long-duration was

attributed in [2℄ to multipathing between the soure and the site. This hy-

pothesis was further explored in [26℄, [27℄ while being assoiated with surfae

wave propagation of the Rayleigh and Love types, presumably between the

soure and the entry to the Mexio City basin, via the intervening rust.

In a rather omplete (other than the neglet of attenuation) 3D numer-

ial study [5℄, the long duration and large amplitude of response at various

distanes from subdution zone earthquakes in Mexio were attributed to

the entrapment of the seismi disturbane in an aretionary prism (wedge-

shaped heterogeneity) of the rust and its subsequent propagation to the

point of observation. The authors of this work later [3℄, [4℄ stressed the role

of higher-order surfae waves whih propagate in the relatively-high Q layer

of the Trans Mexian Volani Belt (TMVB) underlying the soft lay basin of

Mexio City in addition to that of the aretionary prism in produing large

response (partiularly with respet to duration) in the ity. More reently,

an analysis [1℄ of seismograms reorded at various sites in entral Mexio, for

earthquake soures loated in the subdution zone o(cid:27) the Pai(cid:28) oast, have

shown that the rustal struture (inluding that of the TMVB, omposed

of low-veloity volani lava and tu(cid:27) overlying higher veloity limestone)

between the soure and observation points "ats as a waveguide for surfae

3

waves oming from distanes greater than 200km", leading, by an unex-

plained mehanism, to ampli(cid:28)ation and inrease of duration of motion at

various sites, this being thought to aount for at least part of the anomalous

response in Mexio City to remote seismi disturbanes. Numerial results

obtained in earlier studies (e.g., [9℄, [10℄) with a rather omplete, 2D hy-

brid model of the propagation path between the soure and the Mexio-City

basin, and of the ation of the basin on the inident wave, also stressed the

important role of regional path e(cid:27)ets on anomalous response.

Anomalous response in other ities suh as Beijing, Buharest, Rome, et.

has been studied in great detail, prinipally in numerial manner, within the

framework of the UNESCO-IGCP pro jet 414 [17℄, [8℄. The features of this

response were attributed to the spei(cid:28)s of the soure parameters, regional

path e(cid:27)ets, and the spei(cid:28)s of the soil distribution and geometry in the

urban basins (see next paragraph). These (cid:28)ndings have been substantiated

in a more reent study [18℄.

Topi (b) deals with a lass of alternative or omplementary (so-alled

loal) paradigms for explaining seismi motion in urban sites built on soft

soil. Even though the anomalous response in 1985 in Mexio City originated

in a subdution zone soure whose epientral distane was some 350 km from

the ity, it has been ommon to seek explanations of this response (and others

suh as in Nie [13℄, [19℄ and Buharest [14℄) by employing models involving

vertially-propagating or nearly vertially-propagating plane waves. This

requires that the foal distane of the soure to the surfae be large and that

the epientral distane from the soure to the ity be rather small. Although

both of these onditions are often not met in pratie (and, in partiular, as

onerns the 1985 Mihoaan earthquake), the vertially-propagating plane

wave solliitation usually prevails in the theoretial/numerial studies [14℄,

[7℄, [28℄, apparently beause it simpli(cid:28)es the analysis (another reason is that

it failitates omparison with the so-alled 1D model of normally-inident

plane waves on a vertially-layered half spae). This has the e(cid:27)et of putting

the fous on what ours in the struture vertially below the ity, namely,

on the soft basin on whih the earthquake-prone ities are built. Thus, a

onsiderable amount of studies (see [26℄, [29℄, [28℄ for omprehensive reviews)

examine the (loal) e(cid:27)et of the soft basin on the inident wave, but at

present, it is thought that loal e(cid:27)ets aount for only part of the anomalous

response [26℄, [27℄, [17℄, [8℄, [1℄, [18℄. Another idea that has been explored in

the past few years is that the buildings of the ity, in interation with the

soft soil and with eah other, may also amplify and lengthen the duration

of the ground motion (see [12℄, [19℄ for reviews of this sub jet). All of these

studies (inluding or exluding the buildings) point to the entral role of

surfae waves, quali(cid:28)ed either as loally-launhed surfae (e.g., Love) waves

(at the basin edges or at heterogeneities of the soft soil) [30℄, [29℄, [9℄, [18℄

or as quasi-Love waves (exited at the base of the buildings and re-ampli(cid:28)ed

by interation with neighboring buildings [12℄, [31℄, [19℄) as a possible ausal

4

agent of anomalous response, but little [32℄, if any, theoretial evidene has

been given to bak up these assertions.

Topi () is lassial in seismologial geophysis [33℄. The seismi signals

assoiated with various types of surfae (e.g., Love and Rayleigh) waves

are oft-used tools for reonstruting features of the earth's rust suh as

thikness, omposition (e.g., vertial layering harateristis [33℄, [34℄) and

even lateral heterogeneities [35℄, [11℄. More reently [20℄, [21℄, it has been

shown that seismi soures in the neighborhood of fault zones (FZ, i.e., soft

nearly-vertial layers surrounded by relatively hard soil) exite surfae waves

(quali(cid:28)ed as "trapped") in the viinity of the FZ whih propagate to the

ground where they an be deteted and used to furnish information on the

physial and geometrial harateristis of the FZ. To treat these inverse

problems in a fully unambiguous manner requires a thorough understanding

of the way the seismi soure interats (notably how aurately one must

know the position and harateristis of the soure) with the inhomogeneities.

Topi (d) is also a lassial one in seismology, the main onern being

to loalize and qualify (e.g., determine the moment tensor of ) earthquake

soures [22℄, [23℄. As the seismi wave, inluding its surfae-wave ompo-

nents, travels laterally (sometimes over long distanes) in and along the

rust before reahing the measurement loations on the ground, the inverse

problem is di(cid:30)ult to solve if the rustal features (whih an inlude lat-

eral heterogeneity) are not known beforehand. In any ase, it is important

to determine the in(cid:29)uene of errors of the rustal model on the reonstru-

tion of the soure loation and moment tensor, and to do this requires an

appropriate theoretial analysis.

The theoretial-numerial investigation herein is foused on topis (a)

and (b). In ontrast to the inverse-sattering topis () and (d) (to whih

our analysis ould be applied) wherein the response is known and the prop-

agation medium and/or the soure are to be determined, the problem we

are faed with herein deals with forward-sattering: given the seismi soure

and the harateristis of the propagation medium, determine the response

(displaement in the frequeny and/or time domain) on the ground. More

spei(cid:28)ally, we shall be onerned with a (deeivingly-) simple anonial

sattering problem: that of a ylindrial SH pulse wave impinging on a soft

homogeneous layer, the latter being horizontal, of in(cid:28)nite lateral extent,

bounded above by the ground and below by an interfae with a half spae

(cid:28)lled with hard homogeneous rok. The questions we address, and that we

think an be answered with the help of suh a simple model, are:

(i) is it possible to obtain anomalous (in the sense mentioned above in

onnetion with the Mihoaan earthquake) response without any lateral

heterogeneity (arising from volumi inlusions or uneveness of interfaes) in

the underground medium?

(ii) what is the relation of 1D to 2D response and how adequate is it to

model the general response of the on(cid:28)guration by its response to a (nearly)

5

response?

HHS,

HHS.

vertially-inident plane wave?

(iii) how does the foal distane of the soure a(cid:27)et the response?

(iv) how does the epientral distane a(cid:27)et the response?

(v) how does the ontrast of mehanial properties between the layer and

the half spae a(cid:27)et the ground response?

(vi) how does the thikness of the layer a(cid:27)et the response?

(vii) how do the spetral harateristis of the inident pulse a(cid:27)et the

It will be shown that a soure radiating ylindrial waves in a fully-elasti

soft layer/hard half spae medium produes a ground response whih is the

sum of three terms orresponding to various ombinations of two types of

waves in the soft layer (SL) and hard half spae (HHS):

(1) standing body waves (SBW) in the SL and body waves (BW) in the

(2) standing body waves in the SL and surfae waves (SW) in the HHS,

(3) standing surfae waves (SSW) in the SL and surfae waves in the

Only type (2) waves orrespond to Love modes (at the resonane frequen-

ies of these modes) and the onditions for optimal exitation and maximal

ontribution of these modes will be rendered expliit. It will be shown that

large-duration (i.e., anomalous) response generally requires a preponderant

ontribution of at least one (usually the lowest-order) of the Love modes to

the overall response. The type (1) waves dominate in the situation in whih

the foal distane is large and do not usually produe long-duration response,

although they an produe strong (although normal) response when the on-

trast of mehanial properties between the SL and HHS is large. Beating

phenomena will be shown to be a onsequene of interferene between type

(1) and type (2) waves whih both lead to maxima in response at nearly

the same (low) frequeny. Type (3) waves turn out to have negligible on-

tribution to overall response. Most of these features arry over to the ase

in whih the layer is lossy. The pratial onsequenes of these results, in

relation with topis (a) and (b), will be disussed.

2 Desription of the on(cid:28)guration

Fig. 2.1 represents a ross-setion (sagittal plane) view of the site. Γg

is the ground, assumed to be (cid:29)at and horizontal, above whih is loated the

air medium, assumed to be the vaumn. Ω1 is the laterally-in(cid:28)nite domain
oupied by the mehanially-soft layer and h is its thikness. Ω0 is the semi-

in(cid:28)nite domain (substratum) oupied by a mehanially-hard medium, and

Γh the (cid:29)at, horizontal interfae between the layer and the substratum. A
Ox1x2x3 artesian oordinate system is attahed to this on(cid:28)guration suh
that O is on the ground, x2 inreases with depth and x3 is perpendiular to

6

the (sagittal) plane of the (cid:28)gure. With

xj axis, we note that the unit vetors normal to Γg and Γh are
and M 1
(cid:28)lling Ω0 and Ω1 are M 0

ij the unit vetor along the positive
i2 . The media

respetively and the latter are assumed

to be initially stress-free, linear, isotropi and homogeneous. We assume

that M 0

is non-dissipative and M 1

dissipative.

is generally (unless spei(cid:28)ed otherwise)

The seismi disturbane is delivered to the site in the form of a shear-

horizontal (SH) ylindrial pulse wave radiated by a line soure (perpendi-

ular to the sagittal plane) loated at

xs

2), with, by hypothesis,
xs
2 > h (i.e.,
Ω0 ). The SH nature of this wave means that the motion
assoiated with it is stritly transverse (i.e., in the x3 diretion and indepen-
dent of the x3 oordinate). Both the SH polarization and the invariane of
the inident wave with respet to x3 are ommuniated to the (cid:28)elds that are

∈

xs := (xs

1, xs

generated at the site in response to the inident wave. Thus, our analysis

will deal only with the propagation of 2D SH waves (i.e., waves that depend

exlusively on the two artesian oordinates x1, x2 and that are assoiated
with motion in the x3 diretion only).

We shall be onerned with a desription of the elastodynami wave-

(cid:28)eld on the ground (i.e., on Γg ) resulting from the ylindrial seismi wave

solliitation of the site.

3.4 Material onstants in a dissipative medium

A word is now in order about the dissipative nature of the layer. When a

medium M is lossy, the wavenumber therein is omplex and an be written
(omitting, for the moment, the ω dependene) as

k = k′ + ik” ,

(3.11)

where, by onvention,

We now refer to (3.7) and note that omplex k implies omplex µ, due to the

3.5 Boundary and radiation onditions

We assume the two media to be in welded ontat so that the displaement

Sine the air/layer interfae Γg (i.e., the ground) is assumed to separate the

vaumn from an elasti medium, the normal omponent of stress must vanish

on this boundary, i.e.,

wherein ∂n = i2 · ∇

4 Exat solutions in the frequeny domain by sep-

aration of variables

4.1 Preliminaries

Although the material in this setion (4) is lassial as regards the way

of obtaining plane wave integral representations of the (cid:28)elds, the way these

integrals are deomposed, analyzed, and omputed is di(cid:27)erent than in previ-

ous investigations (e.g., [37℄,[38℄,[39℄,[40℄,[41℄, [42℄,[43℄,[44℄,[45℄,[46℄, [47℄,[48℄,

[49℄,[50℄,[51℄; the onsiderable quantity and variety of these publiations at-

tests to the rihness and importane of the sub jet, and to the fat that

ertain features of the latter ertainly remain to be disovered). In a (cid:28)rst

12

sublass of these investigations, the plane wave integrals (with the horizon-

tal wavenumber as the variable of integration) are redued to residue series

(so-alled modal series) plus branh ut integrals whih are usually negleted

if the soure-to-observation point is large ompared to the wavelength. In a

seond sublass of the aforementioned investigations, various devies are em-

ployed to evaluate in numerially-e(cid:30)ient, aurate, or asymptoti manner

the plane wave integrals. Our ontribution is essentially of the seond vari-

ety, but numerial e(cid:30)ieny (more important in the inverse problem ontext)

is of less interest to us than the physial signi(cid:28)ane of the terms entering

into our hoie of the deomposition of the integrals.

4.2 Frequeny-domain solutions in the absene of the layer

wave' and designate it by ui

By applying separation of variables in the artesian oordinate system to

the Helmholtz equation and using the radiation ondition, it an be shown

partiular, to the three individual types of standing waves (SBW1, SBW2,

SSW) of whih it is omposed. Here, we fous on a generi SBW1 and note

that its amplitude dG1

1 is the produt of three fators: the fator S(ω) asso-

iated with the spetrum of the inident pulse, a geometri fator assoiated

with the loation of the soure (whose in(cid:29)uene was already disussed), and

ζ = γ > 1 whih is in ontradition with the fat ζ must lie in [0, 1]. The
seond possibility is that ψ = υφ; we will re-onsider this ase further on.
The third possibility is sin(2φη) = 0 whene φη = nπ/2 ; n = 0, 1, .... To
determine for what values of n these roots orrespond to atual minima of

(i.e., υφ = ψ) is not ontraditory with the onstraint ζ

Thus, the three types of solutions leading to minima of F 1

[30℄ or the 'one-dimensional resonane frequeny' [53℄, [13℄ of the soft soil

layer/hard substratum on(cid:28)guration. However, a sinusoidal response fun-

tion of the type F 1

1 is not onsistent with resonant response (whih is in(cid:28)nite

at the resonane frequenies in the absene of a dissipation mehanism) that

would arise, for instane, in the ontext of exitation of some sort of stru-

tural mode; in fat, this sinuoidal response results from interferene of waves,

whih is the reason why we termed F 1

1 the 'interferene fator'. Thus, it is

improper to employ the term 'resonanes' [30℄, [54℄, [53℄ in onnetion with

body wave response (embodied in I 1

) of the on(cid:28)guration.

To onlude this disussion, we now onsider the spetral fator S(ω). It
is obvious that if S(ω) = S(ηc0/h) is signi(cid:28)antly large near the frequenies
η = (2m + 1)π/2φ ; m = 0, 1, ... at whih F 1

partiular, if S(ω) = S(ηc0/h) is maximal near the low frequeny η = π/2φ,

1 is large, then the produt of

then the response will be large over a large range of horizontal wavenumbers

due to the ontribution of the m = 0 maximum of the interferene fator
F 1
1 . This has been noted repeatedly in the past [30℄, [53℄, [54℄, and termed
a 'resonant response' (as mentioned above), whih it is not beause η =
(2m + 1)π/2φ ; m = 0, 1, ... are not resonane frequenies.

5.4 Amplitudes of the SBW2

We again restrit our attention to the (cid:28)eld in the soft layer, and, in

partiular, to the SBW2 omponent. We note that the amplitude dG1
2 of
the generi SBW2 is the produt of three fators: the fator S(ω) assoiated

with the spetrum of the inident pulse, a geometri fator assoiated with

the loation of the soure (whose in(cid:29)uene was already disussed), and a

so-alled interferene fator F 1
2 dk1 with
S(ω) in order to evaluate the ontribution of generi SBW2 to the overall

2 dk1 . Here we disuss the produt F 1

A few remarks are in order.

(1) ontrary to what may be inferred from works suh as [30℄, [53℄, [54℄,

[26℄, the individual Love modes do not have the struture of surfae waves

in the layer (and, therefore, on the ground) sine the SBW2 are atually

standing body waves; the only feature they share with surfae waves (i.e.,

the SW that oexist in the hard substratum when Love modes are exited)

is their phase veloity

wherein it an be noted that due to the fat that ζ

[1, γ],

∈

cL =

c0
ζ

,

cL < c0 ,

(5.62)

(5.63)

whih means that the phase veloity of Love modes (shared by the SBW2 in

the layer and the SW in the hard substratum) is less than the phase veloity

of body waves in the the hard substratum,

(2) ontrary to the what ours in onnetion with the SBW1, the exi-

tation of Love modes is indeed a resonant proess, beause Love modes are

atually strutural modes of the soft layer/hard substratum on(cid:28)guration

and beause the response assoiated with eah of these modes is in(cid:28)nite at

resonane in the absene of dissipation in both of the media of the on(cid:28)gu-

ration (this response an be large, but (cid:28)nite, when dissipation is present),

(3) the resonant frequenies of the Love modes are not idential to the

frequenies at whih the SBW1 attain their maxima; for instane, the di(cid:27)er-

ene of these frequenies, for the m-th prevalent odd-type SBW1 and SBW2,

is:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

#

(5.64)

whih means that the frequeny of ourrene of the maxima of the m-

th order SBW1 is higher than (although it an be lose to) that of the

orresponding SBW2 (note that the di(cid:27)erene in (5.64) does not depend on

m).

To onlude this disussion, we again onsider the spetral fator S(ω). It
is obvious that if S(ω) = S(ηc0/h) is signi(cid:28)antly large near the frequenies
ηLo
m at whih F 1
of these two funtions, embodied in I 1

2 is large (in(cid:28)nite if no dissipation is present), then the produt

2 , will be large at these frequenies. In

partiular,

if S(ηc0/h) is maximal near the low frequeny ηLo

0 , then the

response will be large over a large range of horizontal wavenumbers.

If

S(ω) = S(ηc0/h) is maximal near the low frequeny ηLo
too far from ηBo

0 , and ηLo
0

0 , then the global response an be even larger due to the

is not

umulative ontribution of both the SBW1 and SBW2.

5.5 Amplitudes of the SSW

We are again onerned with the (cid:28)eld in the soft layer, and, in partiular,

with its SSW omponent. We note that the amplitude dG1
3 of the generi
SSW is the produt of three fators: S(ω) whih is assoiated with the spe-

trum of the inident pulse, a geometri fator assoiated with the loation

of the soure (whose in(cid:29)uene was already disussed), and the interferene

fator F 1

3 dk1 . Here we disuss the produt of F 1

3 dk1 with S(ω) in order to

evaluate the ontribution of generi SSW to the overall response in the layer

and on the ground.

Although the theoretial analysis arried out in the set. 5 may be useful

for underlining the role played by the di(cid:27)erent types of body and surfae

waves that appear in the (cid:28)elds in the layer and substratum, it does not

resolve the pratial problem of the atual evaluation of the integrals I 1
and I 1

1 , I 1
2
3 . Another drawbak of this analysis is that it is restrited to the ase

in whih the layer is elasti, but the onlusions that were drawn for the

elasti layer ase should not be radially di(cid:27)erent for the ase of a weakly-

or moderately-visoelasti layer.

Consequently, we resorted to a purely numerial (i.e., Simpson integra-

tion) approah for the evaluation of I 1

2 and I 1

we evaluated these integrals and the total frequeny response u(xg, ω) under
the assumption of visoelasti layers. One u(xg, ω) was omputed, we de-
termined the temporal signal u(xg, t), again by purely numerial means, via

(3.35).

The weakness of the numerial approah is that it makes it di(cid:30)ult to

disern the mehanisms underlying the observed response. To overome this,

we will give in set. 8 a phenomenologial analysis of the frequeny-domain

and time-domain responses whih should failitate the omprehension of the

partiular features of the temporal signals.

7.1 Preliminaries

be 2000kg/m3

In all exept set. 7.9 we take the density of the hard half spae ρ0

to

. Contrary to what was assumed in the preeding theoretial

analysis, we heneforth take into aount the lossy nature of the soft layer.

The quality fator Q1
in set. 7.9 (reall that the hard half spae is non-lossy, i.e., Q1 =

is hosen equal to 30 in all the omputations exept

∞). The

seismi soure is assoiated with the pseudo-Riker impulse funtion given

in (3.4) whose spetrum is given in (3.10). Examples of these spetra (i.e.,

their moduli) are displayed in (cid:28)g. 7.1.

Unless stated otherwise, the thikness of the layer h is taken to be 50m.

This (cid:28)gure ould just as well be 10km provided the wavelength Λ1
the wavespeed c1

are adjusted so as to keep the ratio h/Λ1 = hν/c1

and/or

onstant.

This issue is disussed in more depth in the set. 7.9.

7.2 Comparison of the results of two methods for determin-

ing the frequeny domain response on the ground

In order to be reasonably sure that the separation of variables tehnique

employed herein gives valid results for a visoelasti layer, we ompared these

results to those obtained by a (cid:28)nite element time domain visoelasti ode

To begin, onsider a on(cid:28)guration thought to be representative of that

in the entral portion of the ity of Nie (Frane) wherein c0 = 1000m/s,
, c1 = 200m/s. We (cid:28)rst plae the soure at a relatively-
ρ1 = 1800kg/m
xs = (0m, 3000m) and evaluate the
large depth of 3km on the x2 axis, i.e.,

3

moduli of the ground transfer funtions relatively near the epienter, i.e.,

epienter, i.e.,

x = (100m, 0m) (left sub(cid:28)gure in (cid:28)g. 7.3) as well as relatively far from the
x = (3000m, 0m) (middle sub(cid:28)gure in (cid:28)g. 7.3), and then
plae the soure at a relatively-small depth of 100m on the x2 axis, i.e.,
xs = (0m, 100m) and evaluate the ground transfer funtions relatively far

from the epienter, i.e.,

x = (3000m, 0m) (right sub(cid:28)gure in (cid:28)g. 7.3).

It will be notied that, in this and pratially all subsequent results, the

of the preeding setion, that the ontribution to overall ground response of

urve relative to

the standing surfae waves in the layer is negligible. Thus, we restrit the

following disussion to the sole ontribution of the standing bulk waves of the

(cid:28)rst (SBW1) and seond kinds (SBW2). The left and middle panels in (cid:28)g.

7.3 show that when the the foal depth is large the ground response is largely

dominated by the ontribution of the SBW1 (i.e., by |
and, in fat, the SBW2 have no in(cid:29)uene on the response beyond ∼

|),
1Hz.

However, the right panel in (cid:28)g. 7.3 gives just the opposite result when

1 (xg, ν)/ui(xg, ν)
I 1

the foal depth is small, sine the ground response is largely dominated by

|) and the SBW1 have little in(cid:29)uene beyond
1Hz. Another interesting feature of these results is that the total response

the SBW2 (i.e., by |
∼

urves have notieably-di(cid:27)erent appearane when the soure is deep or shal-

low (notie that this appearane is qualitatively the same for small and large

epientral distanes, assuming the same, large foal depths in the two ases).

Next onsider a somewhat softer environment than in Nie wherein c0 =
, c1 = 200m/s ((cid:28)g. 7.4). We (cid:28)rst plae the soure

tions relatively far from the epienter, i.e.,

xs = (0m, 3000m) and evaluate the ground transfer fun-
x = (3000m, 0m) (left sub(cid:28)g-

ure in (cid:28)g. 7.4), and then plae the soure at a relatively-small depth, i.e.,

xs = (0m, 100m), and again evaluate the ground transfer funtions relatively
x = (3000m, 0m) (right sub(cid:28)gure in (cid:28)g. 7.4). We

far from the epienter, i.e.,

again observe that the ground response is dominated by the SBW1 when the

soure is deep and by the SBW2 when the soure is shallow. Also we notie

that the appearane of the total response urve for a deep soure is di(cid:27)erent

from than of a shallow soure.

We next onsider a Mexio-ity like site (of ourse without the build-

3
ings, ontrary to the ase in [12℄) in whih c0 = 600m/s, ρ1 = 1300kg/m
c1 = 60m/s ((cid:28)g. 7.5). In all exept the lower right hand panel we again ob-

,

serve that the ground response is dominated by the SBW1 when the soure

is deep and by the SBW2 when the soure is shallow. The exeptional ase

is that of a shallow soure and small epientral distane, for whih the on-

tributions of the SBW2 and SBW1 to the overall response are of omparable

magnitude, espeially near the (cid:28)rst low frequeny peak. A plausible ause

of this behavior is the rather large ontrast of body-wave veloities between

the the layer and substratum, thus giving rise to a large ontribution of

the individual SBW1 at the fundamental Haskell frequeny (reall that this

ontribution is all the greater the greater the body wave veloity ontrast).

Next we onsider a Mexio City-like environment with a somewhat harder

substratum for whih c0 = 1500m/s, ρ1 = 1300kg/m

3

, c1 = 60m/s ((cid:28)g. 7.6).

For a deep soure and large epientral distane (left panel of the (cid:28)gure), the

response is dominated, as usual, by the SBW1. When the soure is shallow

and the epientral distane is large (right panel of the (cid:28)gure) we enounter

a new kind of response haraterized by ontributions of the SBW1 and

SBW2 that are of omparable magnitude (this was obtained in the previous

fat that the body wave veloity ontrast is very large (it was smaller in

the on(cid:28)guration of the previous (cid:28)gure) whih fat favorizes a substantial

ontribution of the SBW1 (notably near the fundamental Haskell frequeny),

thikness h for a shallow soure and large epientral distane. We observe

in the (cid:28)gure that the response is dominated by the umulative ontribution

of the SBW2 for all the layer thiknesses. Furthermore, the number and

(cid:28)nesse of the resonane peaks in the interval [0, 2Hz] inreases with h, the

maxima hange as a funtion of these loations. Not unexpetedly, the

largest pulses are those for whih the soure to observation point distanes

are the smallest. Of partiular interest is the fat that the input pulse

duration is approximately 2/ν0 , whih orresponds to ∼8s for the 0.25Hz
pulse, ∼4s for the 0.5Hz pulse, and ∼2s for the 1.0Hz pulse. As will be

seen hereafter, the response to these pulses in the layered on(cid:28)guration is

generally of muh longer duration.

7.5 Comparison of frequeny and time domain responses for

onstant soure-to-observation point distanes

Again, we begin by a on(cid:28)guration thought to be representative of that

in the entral portion of the ity of Nie (Frane) wherein c0 = 1000m/s,
, c1 = 200m/s. Two onstant soure-to-observation point

(solid line urves in (cid:28)g. 7.11), and b)

distane situations are onsidered: a)

(dotted line urves in (cid:28)g. 7.11). We notie in the left panel of (cid:28)g. 7.11 that

the (cid:28)rst bump of the transfer funtion ours at a lower frequeny when the

soure is near to the layer than when it is far from the layer, whih fat

suggests that the lower-frequeny bump is due to the (resonant) exitation

of the fundamental Love mode (SBW2) whereas the higher-frequeny peak is

assoiated with the (cid:28)rst (non-resonant) interferene (SBW1) maximum. The

same remarks apply to the higher-order bumps. Moreover, the value of the

transfer funtion at the (cid:28)rst ouple of bumps is muh larger due to Love mode

exitation than to onstrutive interferene e(cid:27)ets, and sine the widths of

these two bumps are approximately the same, the (cid:28)nesse (height/width ratio)

ν0 = 0.9Hz.

of the Love mode peak is larger than that of the interferene peak. The

translation of this into the time domain is that the signal assoiated mainly

with the fundamental Love mode resonane is more intense and of longer

duration than the signal assoiated mainly with the fundamental interferene

bump.

This last remark should be tempered by onsideration of the spetrum of

the input pulse, sine the transfer funtions do not take this spetrum into

aount whereas the temporal signals do. Thus, when the loation of the

maximum of the spetrum of the input pulse is loser to the loation of the

maximum of the transfer funtion, the time-domain response is larger, as seen

in (cid:28)g. 7.12, this being true for signals that are essentially due both to Love

resonanes or to onstrutive interferene e(cid:27)ets (note that the loation of the

pulse maxima were adjusted so as to be lose to the loations of the transfer

funtion fundamental peaks). Atually, this (cid:28)gure reveals the existene of a

beating phenomenon in the ground response temporal signal for a soure near

the layer, whih is probably due to the ombined (amplitude modulation)

e(cid:27)ets of the fundamental Love mode peak and the fundamental interferene

peak. This issue will be disussed in more depth in the next setion.

Next onsider the somewhat softer-than-in-Nie environment wherein

c0 = 600m/s, ρ1 = 1300kg/m

line urve in (cid:28)g. 7.13). All that was said in the previous example onerning

the transfer funtions holds in the present ase. Likewise, the reperussions

on the temporal signals are the same as in the previous ase (short duration

signal for a remote soure and relatively-long signal for a near soure.

whih c0 = 600m/s, ρ1 = 1300kg/m

a near soure.

7.6 Time domain responses for very large and very small

soure-to-observation point distanes

We again onsider a Mexio-ity like site at whih c0 = 600m/s, ρ1 =
, c1 = 60m/s ((cid:28)g. 7.15). Although in (cid:28)g. 7.5 upper left and

1300kg/m

3

lower right panels) we observed that the transfer funtions for very large

and very small soure-to-observation point distanes are qualitatively very

similar, we are somewhat surprized to (cid:28)nd that the two orresponding signals

in (cid:28)g. 7.15 are so qualitatively similar, due to the fat that the transfer

funtion orresponding to the left panel in (cid:28)g. 7.5 is dominated by the SBW1

ontribution, whereas the transfer funtion orresponding to the right hand

panel in (cid:28)g. 7.5 has strong ontributions from both the SBW1 and SBW2.

The lue to this unexpeted result resides in the spetrum of the ν0 = 0.5Hz

input pulse (see middle panel of (cid:28)g. 7.1), sine the maximum of the latter

is around ν0 = 0.6Hz and this frequeny is both far-removed form the peaks

the SBW1 (the latter fat providing an explanantion of the relatively-short

duration of the response signals in (cid:28)g. 7.15 (note that the intensity of the

very lose soure-to-observation point signal is muh larger than that of the

other signal, as it should be).

7.7 Time domain responses for di(cid:27)erent input pulses and

(cid:28)xed soure and observation point oordinates

It is of onsiderable interest to asertain to what extent the spetrum of

the soure a(cid:27)ets the ground response [18℄, notably when the soure is near

the layer. In (cid:28)g. 7.16 (whih again applies to the Mexio City like environ-

ment), we see, as expeted, that when the spetrum of the input pulse is suh

as to overlap substantially the frequeny band overed by the fundamental

Love mode peak (left and middle panels in (cid:28)g. 7.16), the duration of the

signal is large. When the spetrum of the input pulse is suh as to over-

lap substantially the frequeny band overed by the seond Love mode peak

(right panel in (cid:28)g. 7.16), the duration of the signal is smaller than in the

previous ase due to the smaller (cid:28)nesse of the seond Love mode resonane

peak. In all three ases, we observe some beating, presumably due to the

proximity of the interferene peak and Love resonane peak in the transfer

funtion.

7.8 Time domain responses for various layer thiknesses and

A more thorough study of the in(cid:29)uene of the input spetrum must take

into aount variations of the layer thikness.

This is done (again in

the Mexio City-like environment and for a soure that is 100m below the

ground) in (cid:28)g. 7.17 for a 20m thik layer, in (cid:28)g. 7.18 for a 40m thik layer,

in (cid:28)g. 7.19 for a 60m thik layer, and in (cid:28)g. 7.20 for a 90m thik layer. We

observe quite di(cid:27)erent responses, varying from a short pulse quite similar

response (in the left hand panel of the (cid:28)gure) is dominated, as usual, by the

fundamental interferene peak, and this results in a relatively-long duration

time domain signal (solid line urve in the right hand panel of the (cid:28)gure)

in response to a ν0 = 0.5Hz input pulse. When the soure is shallow and

the epientral distane is large the frequeny response is dominated, unsur-

prizingly, by the fundamental Love mode resonane peak, and this gives rise

to a somewhat longer-duration signal (dotted line urve in the right hand

indiates that it may be di(cid:30)ult to distinguish between the ontributions of

relatively soft and lossy, whereas it is relatively hard (although always softer

than the substratum) in the unknown on(cid:28)guration. Sine harder media

(rustal) on(cid:28)guration exited by the usual pseudo-Riker pulse line soures

are given in (cid:28)g. 7.22 wherein it an be seen that the ground response far

from the epienter (300km): 1) is dominated by the exitation of Love modes

(notably the fundamental), 2) takes the form of a pulse whih has a shape

not very di(cid:27)erent from that in (cid:28)g. 10 of [6℄ and is of approximately 100s du-

ration, governed essentially by the fundamental Love resonane peak. Thus,

our theoretial model shows that it is quite possible for a soure underneath,

and relatively lose to, a fairly thik, fairly hard rust overlying a very hard

substratum to give rise to a rather long-duration pulse even at large epien-

tral distanes. What beomes of this pulse when a ity is loated at this

large lateral distane from the soure onstitutes an important, and as yet

not fully-eluidated, question (this meaning, that although studies suh as

[9℄ are designed to take into aount all that ours between the distant

soure and the observation point in the basin, the results that are o(cid:27)ered are

entirely of numerial nature and therefore do not provide an explanation of

the underlying physial proesses).

8 Phenomenologial model of the time-domain

ground response

In set. 6 we mentioned the di(cid:30)ulties of obtaining losed-form expres-

sions of the integrals I 1

1 , I 1

2 and I 1

3 and therefore of the Fourier integral

(3.35) aounting for the time-domain ground response. Nevertheless, the

many numerial examples in set. 7 of the frequeny-domain ground re-

sponse all seem to have ommon features whih we shall attempt to desribe

in this setion in phenomenologial manner. Moreover, this approah will

be shown to provide a simple means of understanding the origin of the main

features of the time domain response.

The prinipal features of the ground transfer funtion |

appeared to be due to interferene and resonane auses and manifested

u(xg, ω)/ui(xg, ω)
|

themselves by a series of well-de(cid:28)ned, regularly-spaed bumps. That the

nature of these bumps be due either to interferene or to resonane auses is

not of primal importane at the present (phenomenologial) level of analy-

sis; the only aspets that interest us now are the relative widths and heights

of the bumps (reall that, in general, the bumps assoiated with interfer-

enes (SBW1) are broader and less intense than the orresponding bumps

assoiated with Love mode resonanes (SBW2)).

We represent eah of these bumps by a gaussian funtion of frequeny,

whih we multiply by the spetrum S(ω) of the inident pulse and by an
and ω to take into aount the fat

(observed in the numerial results) that the di(cid:27)erent bumps of frequeny-

its (cid:28)nesse is all the larger, the smaller is εl . In fat [56℄ (p. 319), Gl(ω) tends

(8.2)

wherein ωl+1 > ωl and L may be a large positive integer. However, the latter

will be taken equal to 4 due to the fat that we assume that the spetrum

S(ω) of the input pulse is not too broad and entered at low frequenies (the

(8.9)

With this in hand, we now try to aount for the main features of the nu-

merial results pertaining to the time reords of ground response.

Assume that one of the bumps in the ground transfer funtion dominates

all others. In the present paradigm, this signi(cid:28)es that one of the terms, say

the m-th in the sum in (8.8) dominates all the others. As observed in the

numerial results, this term should aount either for the fundamental Love

mode resonane (m=1) or for the fundamental interferene peak (m=2), the

neessary ondition for the Love peak to be dominant being that the soure

is lose to the bottom boundary of the layer, and the neessary ondition for

the interferene peak to be dominant being that the soure is far from the

bottom boundary of the layer. In either ase, we have:

u1(xg, t)

≈ Bm(xg, xs, ωm)e− εm
4 t2

cos (ωmt

βm(xg, xs, ωm)) ,

(8.10)

−

whih is indiative of the existene of a monohromati wave (angular fre-

queny ωm ) whose amplitude Bm and phase βm vary with the positions of the

soure and the observation point on the ground, and whih is exponential ly-

attenuated with time. This attenuation is more or less pronouned, so that

the duration of the signal is large if εm is small (i.e., the (cid:28)nesse of the or-

responding transfer funtion bump is large) as would our for a Love mode

resonane, and is relatively small if εm is relatively large (i.e., the (cid:28)nesse of

the orresponding transfer funtion bump is relatively small) as would gen-

erally our for an interferene peak. The same phenomenon is produed,

although with less intensity due to the lowering of |Bm|, if the spetrum of

the inident pulse is suh as to favorize either the seond Love mode res-

onane or the seond interferene peak rather than the fundamental Love

mode resonane or the fundamental interferene peak.

Consider a di(cid:27)erent type of situation in whih two bumps in the ground

transfer funtion dominate all others. In the present paradigm this means

that two terms in (8.8), say the m-th and n-th, dominate all the others, i.e.,

u1(xg, t)

≈ Bm(xg, xs, ωm)e− εm

−
cos (ωnt

−

βm(xg, xs, ωm)) +

βn(xg, xs, ωn)) .

(8.11)

The numerial results in the previous setion show that this ours only

when the m-th term orresponds to a Love mode resonane and the n-th

term to the interferene peak nearest the Love mode resonane peak, so that

n = m + 1 in the present numbering system. Moreover, the most pronouned

phenomena were shown numerially to be produed when the fundamental

49

Love mode resonane and fundamental interferene peak are involved, so

that m = 1, n = 2 is the most interesting ase.

9 Disussion

1.

We shall now attempt to provide answers to the questions raised in set.

The (cid:28)rst question was: is it possible to obtain anomalous response with-

out any lateral heterogeneity in the underground medium? The on(cid:28)guration

studied herein was laterally- homogeneous. We have shown that 1D response

only aounts for interferene e(cid:27)ets (as embodied by the SBW1), but not

for oupling to Love modes (as embodied by the SBW2) in the layer, whih

is partiularly strong when the soure is in the neighborhood of the lower

boundary of the layer. Insofar as anomalous e(cid:27)ets are essentially hara-

terized by long duration and beating phenomena in the signals (e.g., urves

in the middle and right panels of (cid:28)g. 7.19), the answer to this question is

negative as onerns 1D response. However, when the ontrast of material

properties between the layer and substratum is very large, it is possible to

obtain fairly-long duration signals (albeit without beating), whih are es-

sentially assoiated with 1D response, even when the soure is far from the

lower boundary of the layer (solid urve in right panel of (cid:28)g. 7.21). More

generally, i.e., when oupling to Love modes is ahieved, the answer to the

question is positive.

The seond question was: what is the relation of 1D to 2D response and

how adequate is it to model the general response of the on(cid:28)guration by its

response to a (nearly) vertially-inident plane wave? We have shown that

not only does the 1D model not give rise to resonane phenomena, but that

truly-resonant phenomena assoiated with the exitation of Love modes an

only be desribed by a fully 2D (or 3D) model. For a soure far from the lower

boundary of the layer, the response is essentially due to the ontributions of

the SBW1 (more or less equivalent to the 1D response), but when the soure

is near this boundary, the waves (SBW2) not inluded in the 1D model play

a ma jor role in the overall response in that they either overwhelm the 1D

response (long duration response without beating) or ombine with the 1D

response to produe signals with long duration and beating. This (cid:28)nding

should be taken into aount in relation to studies (e.g., [14℄) that attempt

to predit seismi response of urban sites from 1D type of analysis.

The third question was: how does the foal distane of the soure a(cid:27)et

the response? The answer to this question was already provided in the previ-

ous two paragraphs. However, it is opportune to reonsider this question in

the light of topi (b) onerning the e(cid:27)ets of underlying soil heterogeneities,

lateral variations of the underlying soil layer, and built environment on seis-

mi response in urban sites. One an show ([57℄) that a wave inident on a

heterogeneous medium gives rise to a di(cid:27)rated wave whih an be onsidered

to be radiated by indued soures (as opposed to the ative soure assoiated

with the primary seismi disturbane) loated within the medium. These

indued soures an also appear on the boundary of the medium (espeially

51

at endpoints, orners and irregularities of the boundary), so that the edges of

a soft basin or the stress-free ground whih inludes the buildings overlying

a homogeneous soft layer in a ity-like site, an also onstitute the loations

of intense indued soures in response to an inident seismi wave. The (cid:28)elds

radiated by all these indued soures an be represented in a manner identi-

al (provided the basi geometry of the on(cid:28)guration is similar) to that of the

present work, so that muh of what was written and found above, notably

onerning the response to ative soures loated outside, and in the viinity

of the soft layer (and, by extension, to indued soures loated within or on

the boundaries of the soft layer, should apply to ity-like sites built on soft

layers or basins. The most important point (mentioned in referenes suh as

[12℄, impliit in [20℄, [21℄, and proven herein as onerns ative soures) is the

following: the presene of these ative or indued soures, loated near or

within the soft layer overlying a relatively-hard substratum, enables oupling

to Love-type modes whih are responsible for a part of the anomalous ground

response observed in ities suh as Mexio, notably motion haraterized by

long durations and beatings.

The fourth question was: how does the epientral distane a(cid:27)et the

xg =
response? We have shown that the epientral distane (|
(x1, 0) is not as sensitive as other parameters (espeially the foal distane
0
|

ys
1|) as onerns its in(cid:29)uene on duration and on the presene or absene

xs
1|, for

x1 −

−

of beatings in the ground motion (it should be mentioned that in [58℄ the

duration appears to be a linearly-inreasing funtion of epientral distane,

but the slope of this funtion dereases when the rustal layer is softer).

However, the epientral distane (more generally: the distane of the soure

to the observation point) is a ritial fator in determining the intensity of

the signal on the ground (see, e.g., (cid:28)gs. 7.14-7.15).

The (cid:28)fth question was: how does the ontrast of mehanial properties

between the layer and the half spae a(cid:27)et the ground response? There does

not appear to exist a lear-ut answer to this question (see, however, [58℄

in whih it appears rather systematially that softer layers lead to longer

durations and lower peak response for a given epientral distane), sine the

dependene on the mehanial parameters is very muh intermingled with

that on the values of the geometrial and soure parameters. On the whole,

most of the answers to the previous four questions hold in a qualitative sense

whatever the ontrast of mehanial properties (see, e.g., the results herein

for Nie, softer Nie, Mexio, Mexio with harder substratum), although

there are some quantitative di(cid:27)erenes (e.g., the ontrast in(cid:29)uenes onsid-

erably the intensity of the SBW1 ontribution). Naturally, the most remark-

able features of the ground response of our simple on(cid:28)guration, whih are

due to the exitation of the fundamental Love mode, an only be observed if

the layer is softer than the substratum in the sense of (5.3) and (5.4). These

onditions are so broad and widespread (for ity-like sites) as to render the

'anomalous' response desribed herein a quite universal phenomenon.

52

The sixth question was: how does the thikness of the layer a(cid:27)et the

response? In (cid:28)g. 7.7 it was found that inreasing the layer thikness inreases

the number of peaks, as well as the (cid:28)nesse of eah of the latter, in a given

range of frequenies of the transfer funtion. This has the e(cid:27)et of lowering

the frequeny of ourrene of the (cid:28)rst peak so that the time-domain response

will be largely onditioned by the spetrum of the input pulse, assuming the

latter to be entered at a relatively high frequeny. Thus, a low frequeny

pulse an produe substantially the same type of response for a thik layer

as a relatively high frequeny pulse in a thin layer. This point is important

in onnetion with the topi of regional path e(cid:27)ets mentioned in set. 1.

The seventh question was: how do the spetral harateristis of the in-

ident pulse a(cid:27)et the response? The answer to this question an be found

by omparing the three sub(cid:28)gures in any one of (cid:28)gs. 7.17-7.20. Obviously,

the spetrum of the inident pulse is a key fator (see set. 8), whih: a) if

it overlaps either a onstrutive interferene peak or Love mode peak, gives

rise to attenuated, quasi monohromati response, often of long duration

(see (cid:28)gs. 7.17-7.20 in whih an example is given of a pulse having a dura-

tion of 4s that gives rise to substantial ground response of 200s duration),

b) if it overlaps both a onstrutive interferene peak and Love mode peak,

gives rise to attenuated, quasi monohromati response with more or less

regular beatings, ) if it doesn't overlap signi(cid:28)antly either a onstrutive

interferene of Love mode peak, gives rise to a time domain response that

an be qualitatively quite similar to the input signal (see, e.g., left panel of

(cid:28)g. 7.18). When the soures are indued, their spetra will be modi(cid:28)ed with

respet to that of the spetrum of the primary ative soure due to di(cid:27)ra-

tion and dispersion, so that an a priori unfavorable situation for anomalous

response from the point of view of the primary ative soure may turn out

to be favorable from the point of view of the indued soures.

10 Conlusion and perspetives

This work originated in the observation that no satisfatory physial

explanation has been given until now of anomalous seismi response in urban

environments with soft layers or basins overlying a hard substratum. The

prinipal reason for this knowledge gap probably lies in the omplexity of the

sites examined in previous (essentially-numerial) studies: 1) a homogeneous

or multilayered basin of ompliated form not inluding buildings (e.g., [13℄,

[9℄, [59℄), 2) a homogeneous layer overlain by a periodi or non-periodi set of

bloks or buildings (e.g., [12℄, [31℄). The hoie was therefore made herein to

simplify as muh as possible the harateristis of the site and solliitation,

while retaining as many as possible of their essential features. Thus, it was

thought that: i) the problem had to be treated at least as a 2D one, ii) the

solliitation should not be a plane wave (for whih oupling to Love modes

53

is impossible in the hosen on(cid:28)guration) but rather the wave radiated by

a soure whih ould be as simple as a line soure ( this soure eventually

being able to mimik indued soures in more ompliated on(cid:28)gurations),

iii) the soft omponent of the site ould be a layer (rather than a basin)

with (cid:29)at, horizontal boundaries (i.e., (cid:29)at rather than irregular ground, as

rendered by the presene of buildings, (cid:29)at interfae with the substratum,

rather than urved or irregular as for a basin or irregular layer).

In spite of the simpliity of the model, obtaining an explanation of the

prinipal features of the seismi response turned out not to be straightfor-

ward. The temporal response took the form of a Fourier transform (with

respet to frequeny) of a frequeny domain response funtion whih itself is

an integral with respet to the horizontal wavenumber omponent of plane

body and heterogeneous waves. It was shown that the wavenumber integral

splits quite naturally into three parts omprising either standing body waves

in the layer (SBW1) and propagating body waves (BW) in the substratum,

standing body waves in the layer (SBW2) and surfae waves (SW2) in the

substratum, standing surfae waves in the layer (SSW) and surfae waves

in the substratum (SW3). It turns out that the amplitudes of the SW and

SBW2 diminish exponentially as the vertial distane of the soure to the

lower boundary of the layer inreases so as to make the ontribution of the

SBW1 preponderant for soures with large foal depths. This fat provides

an explanation of the relative suess of the 1D model (a remote soure ra-

diates a wave that has pratially all the attributes of a plane wave when

arriving on the layer) for remote soures, but also of the reason why the 1D

model is inappropriate for ative (and, by extension, indued) soures that

are lose to (and, by extension, within) the layer, sine the SBW2 waves

are not inluded in this model. It was shown that eah SBW1/BW pair is

the prinipal ingredient of the 1D model and that the maxima of the am-

plitudes of the SBW1 do not orrespond to resonanes, but are rather the

result of the onstrutive interferene of standing waves in the layer. Eah

SBW2/SW2 pair turned out to be a Love mode when the frequeny satis-

(cid:28)es the Love mode dispersion relation. The amplitudes of eah SSW/SW3

pair were found to be negligible ompared to those of the SBW1/BW and

SBW2/SW2 pairs.

The theoretial analysis reahed its limits when the horizontal wavenum-

ber integration was attempted. Thus, the integrals appearing in the frequeny-

domain response were arried out numerially and a parametri study was

made of the umulative ontributions of the SBW1 and SBW2. It was shown,

as expeted, that the SBW1 give the preponderant ontribution for remote

soures, while both the SBW1 and SBW2 umulative ontributions an be

signi(cid:28)ant for nearby soures. The interferene nature of the amplitudes of

the individual SBW1 was shown to be maintained in the frequeny-domain

umulative response of these waves. The resonant nature of the amplitudes

of the individual SBW2 was shown to be maintained in the frequeny-domain

54

umulative response of these waves. However, it was not possible to obtain

mathematial expressions for the integrals of the frequeny-domain responses

appearing in the global time-domain ground response.

We also showed that it possible for a soure, underneath, and relatively

lose to, a fairly thik (10km), fairly hard rust overlying a very hard substra-

tum, to give rise to a rather long-duration pulse even at large (e.g., 300km)

epientral distanes, and that this (cid:28)nding is in agreement with what has

been observed in onnetion with real earthquakes (see, e.g., [6℄,[9℄). We did

not arry out an extensive analysis of this (cid:28)nding, nor address the issue of

what beomes of this pulse when it enters an urban enter loated at large

lateral distanes from the soure (as was done numerially in works suh as

[9℄,[10℄,[16℄,[17℄).

In the last setion of this investigation, a phenomenologial model was

introdued based on the observation that the frequeny-domain umulative

response omponents of both the SBW1 and SBW2 appear as a series of

regularly-spaed bumps whih were modeled as gaussians. This enabled a

losed form expression of the integral of the frequeny-domain responses

to be obtained whih revealed and aounted for the type of time-domain

response obtained by purely numerial means, notably, its attenuated, quasi

monohromati harater, with regular or irregular beatings, governed by

the (cid:28)nesse and relative position of the frequeny domain bumps. This type

of response has often been observed in earthquake-prone ities built on soft

soil, so that it may be that some of the ausal agents inherent in our simple

model are operative in more ompliated sites.

A question that naturally arises is whether the type of analysis arried

out herein an be extended to more realisti on(cid:28)gurations in whih indued

soures are likely to play a ma jor role. Our feeling is that this an be done

provided some lever approximations are made in the expressions for the

response of these on(cid:28)gurations.

Another question (alluded-to in one of the previous paragraphs) is that

of regional path e(cid:27)ets on global response in ities suh as Mexio sub jet

to earthquakes arising from laterally-remote soures. This very important

theoretial issue, already onsidered in works suh as [15℄, will have to be

treated in more depth, (cid:28)rst in the manner of the present ontribution, to

examine how the wave radiated by the soure reahes the ity site, what

the nature of the waves are when they arrive in the ity, and how they

are onverted therein into the form they have been observed to take (quasi

Love or Rayleigh waves giving rise to high intensity, extremely long (even

longer than what was found herein) duration ground motion, aompanied

by beatings).

Most of the extensions of the present work will have to be arried out

(cid:28)rst in the 2D, shear horizontal wave ontext in order to disern the essential

issues. The extensions to the 2D- P/SV (as in e.g., [9℄) and 3D (as in e.g.,

[59℄) ases with more general types of soures [9℄, [10℄ are, of ourse, the

55

requisites for a full understanding of what happens when a seismi wave hits

a realisti urban site.

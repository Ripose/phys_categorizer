Abstract

We assess the quantitative accuracy of the particle-in-cell (PIC) approximation used
in recent ab initio predictions of the thermodynamic properties of hexagonal-close-
packed iron at the conditions of the Earth’s inner core. The assessment is made
by comparing PIC predictions for a range of thermodynamic properties with the
results of more exact calculations that avoid the PIC approximation. It is shown that
PIC gives very accurate results for some properties, but that it gives an incorrect
treatment of anharmonic lattice vibrations. In addition, our assessment does not
support recent PIC-based predictions that the hexagonal c/a ratio increases strongly
with increasing temperature, and we point out that this casts doubt on a proposed
re-interpretation of the elastic anisotropy of the inner core.

1 Introduction

Ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) (Hohenberg and Kohn
(1964); Kohn and Sham (1965); Jones and Gunnarsson (1989)) are widely used
to calculate the properties of materials at the extreme pressures found in
the interior of the Earth and other planets (Stixrude et al. (1998)), and are
known to be capable of high accuracy. For many years, such calculations

did not generally include thermal eﬀects, and explicitly treated only zero-
temperature materials. However, the past few years have seen an increasing
eﬀort to apply DFT calculations to high-temperature solids and liquids of ge-
ological interest, using ab initio lattice dynamics or molecular-dynamics sim-
ulation (Alf`e et al. (2001, 2002); Belonoshko et al. (2000); Laio et al. (2000);
Stixrude et al. (1997); Wasserman et al. (1996); Brodholt et al. (2002); Oganov et al.
(2001)). Because dynamical DFT calculations demand large computer re-
sources, a simplifying approximation known as the ‘particle-in-cell’ (PIC)
method (Hirshfelder et al. (1954); Holt and Ross (1970); Holt et al. (1970);
Ree and Holt (1973); Westra and Cowley (1975); Cowley et al. (1990)) has
been used in some work on high-T , high-p solids, an important example be-
ing the very recent use of the PIC approximation to re-interpret the elas-
tic anisotropy of the Earth’s solid inner core (Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001)).
However, the reliability of the PIC method has not gone unchallenged (Alf`e et al.
(2001)) and conclusions based on it are not necessarily secure. To shed light
on this question, we present here the results of our own PIC calculations of
a range of thermodynamic properties of solid iron at Earth’s core conditions,
which we compare with more exact calculations that avoid the PIC approxi-
mation.

The purpose of the PIC approximation is to provide a way of calculating
the free energy of a vibrating crystal. The essence of the approximation is
that correlations between the vibrational displacements of diﬀerent atoms are
neglected, so that each atom is treated as vibrating independently of every
other, as in the Einstein model for a vibrating solid. Although the approx-
imation seems at ﬁrst sight rather crude, empirically it has been shown to
yield satisfactory predictions for the thermodynamic properties of a num-
ber of solids (Holt and Ross (1970); Holt et al. (1970); Ree and Holt (1973);
Westra and Cowley (1975)), at least for temperatures above the Debye tem-
perature. In the geological context, it was shown by Wasserman et al. (1996)
that, when implemented using DFT methods, it gives predictions for the p(V )
relation on the shock Hugoniot in excellent agreement with experiment for
Fe up to the melting curve. The PIC approach based on DFT has also been
applied successfully to the high-p, high-T properties of other transition metals
(G¨ulseren and Cohen (2001); Cohen and G¨ulseren (2002)).

In the work on the elastic anisotropy of the Earth’s inner core (Steinle-Neumann et al.
(2001)) mentioned above, PIC was used to calculate the elastic constants of
hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Fe over a range of pressures and temperatures.
A key prediction was that the c/a ratio increases strongly with T , and that
this leads in turn to a strong T -dependence of the elastic constants. It emerged
from this that the observed anisotropy of seismic velocities in the inner core
(Creager (1992); Song and Helmberger (1993); Tromp (1993)) could be inter-
preted in terms of a partial alignment of hcp crystallites. Remarkably, the
calculations required the hcp basal plane to be preferentially aligned along

2

the Earth’s rotational axis, which is the opposite of what had been proposed
earlier (Stixrude and Cohen (1995); Steinle-Neumann et al. (1999)). Since the
correctness of this interpretation depends heavily on the predicted variation of
c/a with T , it is clearly essential to be conﬁdent that the PIC approximation
can be relied on to give this variation correctly, and one of our aims in this
paper is to test this point.

An objective assessment of the errors incurred by the PIC approximation is
made possible by the fact that ab initio free energies and other thermodynamic
functions of high-temperature solids can now be calculated with statistical-
mechanical errors that can be made arbitrarily small. The new methods, de-
scribed in detail in previous papers (Alf`e et al. (2001, 2002)), are based on the
DFT calculation of phonon frequencies in the harmonic approximation, sup-
plemented by the ‘thermodynamic integration’ technique (Frenkel and Smit
(1996)) for calculating anharmonic contributions. For a given material, and
with a given DFT technique for calculating the electronic total energy as a
function of ionic positions, we can therefore compute thermodynamic func-
tions either with the PIC approximation or almost exactly. The diﬀerences
between the two sets of results represent the errors caused by PIC. This is
what we do in the present work. Since the main diﬀerence between PIC and
the newer, more exact methods is that the latter fully include vibrational cor-
relations, we shall refer to these in the following as ‘vibrationally correlated’
calculations.

Two main claims have been made for the PIC method (Wasserman et al.
(1996)): First, that it provides a simple and reasonably accurate way of in-
cluding the eﬀect of the anharmonicity of lattice vibrations on thermodynamic
properties; and second, that, even in the absence of anharmonicity, it is com-
putationally much less demanding than more precise methods. Our assessment
of these claims for the case of high-p/high-T Fe will show that neither is true,
but that nevertheless the PIC method does yield surprisingly accurate pre-
dictions for many thermodynamic properties. We shall elucidate the reasons
why PIC is often accurate. As we shall see, however, the present work does
not support the prediction that the c/a ratio of hcp Fe increases strongly with
temperature, and this casts doubt on the proposed re-interpretation of the
elastic anisotropy of the Earth’s inner core.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe how
we have applied PIC to hcp Fe and how we have separated the various contri-
butions to the free energy and other thermodynamic functions; at the end of
Sec. 2, we summarise the DFT techniques. In Sec. 3, we describe the details of
our free-energy calculations and highlight their implications for the tempera-
ture dependence of the c/a ratio. We then present results for several thermo-
dynamic quantities calculated in the PIC approximation, which we compare
with the earlier PIC results of Cohen and co-workers (Stixrude et al. (1997);

3

Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001); Wasserman et al. (1996)) and with the vibra-
tionally correlated results of Alf`e et al. (2001). Discussion and conclusions
follow in Sec. 4.

2 Techniques

2.1 Particle-in-cell approximation

In classical statistical mechanics, the ab initio Helmholtz free energy of a
vibrating solid containing N ions is:

FAI = −kBT ln

dr1 . . . drN exp [−βUAI(r1 . . . rN )]

,

(cid:27)

(1)

Λ3N Z

(cid:26)

where UAI(r1 . . . rN ) is the ab initio total electronic free energy of the system
when the ionic positions are r1, . . . rN and Λ is the thermal wavelength. It
should be noted that FAI depends on the volume V and temperature T of
the system (β = 1/kBT ), and for an hcp crystal it also depends on the axial
c/a ratio, denoted here by q; for the moment we do not indicate explicitly
the dependence on V , T and q. Two other points should also be recalled.
First, the quantity UAI(r1, . . . , rN ) is a free energy, because the electrons are
treated as being in thermal equilibrium for each set of ionic positions, at a
temperature equal to the temperature T of the system as a whole. Second,
the use of classical statistical mechanics, i.e. the neglect of quantum eﬀects in
the nuclear motions, is fully justiﬁed at Earth’s core temperatures (Alf`e et al.
(2001)).

The PIC approach consists in replacing UAI in the above formula by the ap-
proximate form U PIC
AI

, given by:

U PIC

AI (r1, . . . rN ) = Uperf +

φ(ui) .

N

Xi=1

Here, Uperf ≡ UAI(R1, . . . RN ) is the ab initio free energy of the system when
all ions are at their perfect-lattice positions Ri, and φ(ui) is deﬁned to be the
change of energy UAI(R1, . . . Ri + ui, . . . RN ) − Uperf when ion i is displaced
from its perfect-lattice position to the position Ri + ui, all other ions being
held ﬁxed at their perfect-lattice positions. With UAI replaced by U PIC
in Eqn.

The problem is thus reduced to the calculation of a three-dimensional integral,
which can be performed numerically.

Our later analysis depends on a clear separation of harmonic and anharmonic
contributions to f PIC
vib , which can be accomplished by considering the series
expansion of φ(u) in powers of ionic displacement u:

where the Greek indices α, β... indicate Cartesian components. The value of
f PIC
vib when we retain only the quadratic part of φ(u) is the harmonic vibrational
free energy in the PIC approximation, denoted by f PIC
harm. This can be expressed
as:

f PIC

ln(¯hων/kBT ) = 3kBT ln(¯h¯ω/kBT ) .

The PIC results reported in Sec. 3 were obtained by computing φ(u) for a
set of vector displacements u, and ﬁtting the results using the power series
expansion of Eqn. (5); in practice, for the range of displacements that occur
with appreciable probability at temperatures below the melting temperature,
we ﬁnd that an extremely accurate ﬁt is obtained if we retain only terms up
to quartic order in u. To show what parameters enter this ﬁt, we write this
quartic polynomial explicitly for the case of hcp symmetry:

Here, ux and uy are perpendicular Cartesian components in the basal plane,
the y-axis being oriented towards a nearest-neighbour, and uz is the displace-
ment along the hexagonal axis. The frequencies of harmonic vibration in the
basal plane and along the hexagonal axis are ωa and ωc respectively. With the

above form of φ, the geometric-mean frequency ¯ω given by

3 ln ¯ω = 2 ln ωa + ln ωc .

The vibrational free energy f PIC
vib is obtained essentially exactly by numerical
evaluation of the integral in Eqn. (4) on a regular grid. In analysing the an-
harmonic contributions, it is useful to note that f PIC
anharm can be expanded as a
power series in temperature:

anharm = dT 2 + O(T 3) .
f PIC

For temperatures below the melting point, we ﬁnd that only the term in T 2
is signiﬁcant, so that in practice the anharmonic contributions are completely
speciﬁed by the coeﬃcient d as a function of volume V and c/a ratio q. The
following exact expression for the coeﬃcient is readily obtained:

The above methods are used to obtain contributions to the free energy at a
reference value of q, chosen to be close to the T = 0 equilibrium value. We then
perform further calculations over a range of values of q, to obtain corrections
to the free energy components, which are parameterised in terms of V and T .
The details of this parameterisation are given in Sec. 3.1 and 3.2. Equilibrium
values of q are found by direct minimisation of the total free energy.

2.2 Ab initio methods

The DFT electronic-structure techniques used to perform the PIC calcula-
tions are essentially identical to those described by (Alf`e et al. (2001, 2002)).
The exchange-correlation functional is the generalised gradient approxima-
tion (GGA) of Perdew and Wang (Wang and Perdew (1991); Perdew et al.
(1992)). The implementation of DFT is the projector augmented wave (PAW)
scheme (Bl¨ochl (1994); Kresse and Joubert (1999)), with core radii, augmen-
tation charge radii etc set to the values reported in Alf`e et al. (2000). As be-
fore, all atomic states up to and including 3p-states are treated as core states,
but the high-pressure response of 3s- and 3p-states, known to be important
at Earth’s-core conditions, is included via an eﬀective pair potential; the ac-
curacy of this procedure has been demonstrated earlier (Alf`e et al. (2001)).
Thermal excitation of electrons, also important at core conditions, is treated
with the usual ﬁnite-temperature formulation of DFT (Mermin (1965); Gillan
(1989); Wentzcovitch et al. (1992)). We used a plane-wave cut-oﬀ of 300 eV,

6

as in our previous work. All calculations were performed with the VASP code
(Kresse and Furthm¨uller (1996a,b)).

The PIC vibrational potential φ(u) (see Eqn. (2)) should in principle be cal-
culated by displacing a single atom in an inﬁnite crystal. Because PAW cal-
culations require periodic boundary conditions, we must instead use supercell
geometry, so that the displaced atom has periodic images. To adhere to the
PIC scheme, we must therefore ensure convergence of all results with respect
to the size of the supercell, as described in the following Section.

3 Results

3.1 Free energy of perfect lattice

DFT results for the free energy of the hcp Fe perfect lattice Uperf (V, q, T ) for
the ﬁxed c/a ratio q equal to 1.60 were reported earlier (Alf`e et al. (2001))
for V values from 5.2 to 11.4 ˚A3/atom at temperatures from 200 to 104 K.
At each T value, the results were ﬁtted to a Burch-Murnaghan equation of
state (Poirier (2000)), the parameters of which were then ﬁtted as polynomial
functions of T . We have repeated these calculations for the present work, and
as expected the results are virtually identical to those reported earlier.

To allow for variation of q, we have performed additional calculations of
Uperf(V, q, T ) for q in the range from 1.48 to 1.72, with V going from 5.5 to 10.5
˚A3/atom, and T going from 2000 to 8000 K. All technical parameters, such
as the Monkhorst-Pack sampling set, were kept the same as in the q = 1.60
calculations. To represent the results, we deﬁne the deviation ∆Uperf (V, q, T )
of the perfect-lattice free energy from its value at a chosen of q, denoted by
q0: ∆Uperf (V, q, T ) ≡ Uperf(V, q, T ) − Uperf(V, q0, T ). In the present case, q0
has the ﬁxed value 1.60 throughout. We ﬁnd that ∆Uperf(V, q, T ) can be very
accurately represented at all (V, T ) by the quadratic form:

∆Uperf(q) = α(q − q0)(q − q1) .

(11)

At each V value, α and q1 can be accurately ﬁtted as linear functions of T , the
coeﬃcients of which are then ﬁtted to low-order polynomial functions of V .
These ﬁts give a virtually perfect representation of the ∆Uperf(V, q, T ) results.

The equilibrium value q of the perfect lattice, denoted by qeq, is obtained by
minimising ∆Uperf(V, q, T ) with respect to q. At T = 0, we ﬁnd a very weak
dependence of qeq on V , going from 1.590 at 7.0 ˚A3/atom to 1.578 at 10.0
˚A3/atom. The T -dependence of ∆Uperf(q) is also very weak, with α decreasing
linearly from 7.4 to 6.2 eV, and q1 increasing from 1.59 and 1.62 as temperature

7

varies from 2000 to 8000 K. If we now use the results to predict qeq for the
(hypothetical) high-T perfect lattice, we ﬁnd a variation of at most 0.04 at a
volume of 10.0 A3. The insigniﬁcant V - and T -dependence of qeq is noteworthy,
because it implies that any signiﬁcant variation of qeq at high temperatures
can come only from lattice vibrations, to which we now turn.

3.2 Vibrational free energy

a , K (4)

mix and K (4)

The basal-plane and axial frequencies ωa and ωc, and the four anharmonic
vibrational coeﬃcients K (3), K (4)
c were calculated as follows.
For given values of q and V , a supercell was constructed in which one of the
atoms, the ‘walker’ is displaced from its equilibrium position. The ‘walker’ is
given a series of equally spaced displacements in the three dirctions ˆuy, ˆuz
and 1
√2 (ˆux + ˆuz), the maximum displacements rmax in each direction being
chosen so that the Boltzmann factor exp [−βφ(rmax)] ≈ 0.1 for the maximum
temperatures of interest. Directions were selected to allow the terms in φ(r)
(Eqn. (7)) to be determined as simply as possible by least squares ﬁtting.
Size convergence in terms of supercells is essential to ensure that the walker
cannot ‘see’ its image. We discuss the results of a simple convergence test
below. All the calculations described here are performed at a ﬁxed electronic
temperature of 6000 K, since statistical mechanical considerations will dom-
inate the temperature dependence of f PIC
vib . At this temperature, vibrational
coeﬃcients were fully converged with respect to k-point sampling at each cell
size. Monkhorst-Pack (Monkhorst and Pack (1976)) sampling was used, with
9 × 9 × 5 k-points for the 8 atom cell, 7 × 7 × 5 k-points for 16 atoms and
3 × 3 × 3 for 36. Calculations were performed over a range of volumes from
5.5 ˚A3/atom to 11.5 ˚A3/atom with a ﬁxed axial ratio of q0 = 1.60 as before.
Using 5th order polynomials to obtain a high quality ﬁt, the quantities K (3),
K (4)
c and ln ¯ω were then parameterised in terms of volume. Finally,
a correction due to relaxation of q is added to the harmonic free energy, as for
that of the perfect lattice, by performing a parameterisation of ¯ω in terms of
q, which we describe below.

a , K (4)

mix, K (4)

As noted in Sec. 2.1, the harmonic free energy is completely determined by
the geometric-mean frequency ¯ω (Eqns. (6) and (8)), and we consider ﬁrst our
PIC results for ¯ω as a function of V for the ﬁxed c/a ratio q0 = 1.6. We report
in Fig. 1 our ¯ω results from calculations using supercells of 8, 16 and 36 atoms,
compared with the ¯ω results from our earlier calculations of the full phonon
spectrum (Alf`e et al. (2001)). We note two important points. First, the PIC ¯ω
results are almost independent of supercell size, so that the calculations appear
to be fully converged with respect to size eﬀects. Second, the PIC ¯ω diﬀers
from the full-phonon ¯ω only by a volume-independent shift of ln ¯ω. Since such a
V -independent shift cannot aﬀect most thermodynamic quantities, we expect

(2001) are given by the lighter curve.

the PIC calculations to agree rather closely with full-phonon calculations.

We now consider the dependence of ¯ω on c/a ratio q, deﬁning the deviation
∆¯ω(V, q) from its value at q0 by ¯ω(V, q) = ¯ω(V, q0) + ∆¯ω(V, q). In terms of
this, the harmonic free energy can be written as:

f PIC
harm(V, q, T ) = 3kBT ln(¯h¯ω/kBT )
= f PIC

harm(V, q0, T ) + 3kBT ln [1 + ∆¯ω(V, q, T )/¯ω(V, q, T )] .

(12)

Calculations of ¯ω(q) were made for q-values going from 1.48 to 1.72 at a se-
ries of volumes. We ﬁnd that ¯ω decreases with increasing q. Not surprisingly,
increase of q at constant V yields an increase of the basal-plane frequency ωa
and a decrease of axial frequency ωc. The decrease of ωc succeeds in outweigh-
ing the increase of ωa in the formula for ¯ω (Eqn. (8)), but nevertheless the
resulting decrease of ¯ω is a fairly marginal eﬀect. Over the q-range studied, we
found that the quadratic form ∆¯ω(q) = β(q − q0)(q − q2) gives an accurate ﬁt,
and this ﬁt was performed at volumes of 5.5, 7.0 and 10.5 ˚A3/atom. The V -
dependence of the resulting β and q2 coeﬃcients was obtained by a quadratic
ﬁt.

From the values of the four anharmonic coeﬃcients at each V and q, we
calculate also the anharmonic vibrational free energy f PIC
anharm. As explained
in Sec. 2.1, the most accurate way of doing this is by explicit calculation of
f PIC
(Eqn. (4)) by numerical evaluation of the integral over displacement u,

we can use Eqn. (10) to calculate the d coeﬃcient of the leading term in

the temperature expansion of f PIC
anharm (see Eqn. (9)). In practice, we ﬁnd that
the two methods yield almost indistinguishable results, and everything that
follows is based on evaluation of the d coeﬃcient.

We report in Fig. 2 the volume dependence of d for q = 1.60, compared with
the corresponding anharmonicity coeﬃcient obtained from the more accurate
vibrationally correlated results of Alf`e et al. (2001). The striking and impor-
tant feature of this comparison is that the PIC anharmonic free energy is
positive, whereas the results of Alf`e et al. (2001) show that in reality it is
negative. This means that for high-p hcp Fe, the PIC approximation gives a
completely incorrect account of anharmonicity. However, we note that f PIC
anharm
is in any case very small. For example, at V = 7 ˚A3/atom, T = 6000 K,
f PIC
anharm ≈ 15 meV/atom. Because it is so small, we ignore its dependence on
q in the following, and use a polynomial ﬁt to the d(V ) results for q = 1.60.

3.3 Temperature dependence of c/a ratio

The equilibrium value qeq of the c/a ratio q at given V and T is obtained by
minimising the total free energy F PIC
AI with respect to q. The variation of q with
T comes from the T - and q-dependence of the perfect-lattice free energy U PIC
perf ,
for which we presented results in Sec. 3.1, and from the q-dependence of the
mean vibrational frequency ¯ω (Eqn. (6)). (Since we neglect the q-dependence of
the anharmonic component of free energy, anharmonicity does not contribute
to the T -dependence of qeq here.)

curve) and 10.0˚A3 (dotted curve)

Our results for qeq at three diﬀerent volumes are reported in Fig. 3, where
we compare them with the earlier PIC predictions of Steinle-Neumann et al.
(2001). The present results are very diﬀerent from the earlier ones. At all
volumes, we ﬁnd only a very weak increase of q with T , which is between 5
and 10 times smaller than the variation reported in Steinle-Neumann et al.
(2001). We note that this gross discrepancy can come only from a diﬀerence
in the q-dependence of the harmonic mean frequency ¯ω. The reason for this is
that the roughly linear dependence of qeq on T seen in both our results and
those of Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001) cannot originate either from thermal
electronic excitations or from anharmonicity, since both of these free-energy
components vary as T 2. Unfortunately, explicit results for ¯ω are not reported
in Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001). The cause of the discrepancy, and its impli-
cations for understanding the elastic anisotropy of the inner core, are discussed
further in Sec. 4.

3.4 Thermodynamic functions

All thermodynamic functions can be calculated by taking appropriate deriva-
tives of the PIC free energy F PIC
, with its perfect-lattice, harmonic and an-
harmonic components parameterised as described above. All the results to
be presented include the dependence of the equilibrium c/a ratio qeq on V
and T . Our PIC predictions will be compared with the earlier PIC results
of Wasserman et al. (1996) and with the vibrationally correlated results of
Alf`e et al. (2001).

Fig. 4. The total thermal pressure on isotherms in this work (light curves) and that
of Alf`e et al. (2001) (heavy curves) at 2000 K (solid), 4000 K (dashed) and 6000 K
(dotted) as a function of atomic volume.

We begin by considering the thermal pressure ∆p, which is one of the most
basic quantities in interpreting the properties of the inner core. This is deﬁned
as the diﬀerence between the pressure in the material at a given V and T and
the pressure at the same volume but at zero temperature:

∆p = −(∂F PIC

AI /∂V )T + (∂F PIC

AI /∂V )T =0 .

(13)

Fig. 4 shows a comparison of our PIC results for ∆p with the vibrationally
correlated results of Alf`e et al. (2001) on isotherms at T = 2000, 4000 and
6000 K. The rather close agreement shows that the PIC approximation gives an
accurate account of the thermal pressure. This is expected from our results for
¯ω, since in the harmonic approximation ∆p is given by the electronic thermal
pressure, which is exactly the same in both calculations, plus a vibrational
contribution equal to −3kBT ∂ ln ¯ω/∂V . We have seen that for hcp Fe, the
PIC value of ln ¯ω diﬀers from the exact value by an almost constant oﬀset,
which has no eﬀect on the derivative of ln ¯ω with respect to V . Small diﬀerences
between the PIC and vibrationally correlated thermal pressure may be due to
small variations in the oﬀset between the values of ln ¯ω.

The situation is similar for the thermal energy ∆E, deﬁned as the diﬀerence
between the internal energy E at a given V and T and the internal energy at
the same V but zero temperature: ∆E = E(V, T ) − E(V, 0). The electronic
part of the thermal energy is identical in both PIC and vibrationally corre-
lated calculations, and the harmonic vibrational energy is exactly 3kBT /atom
in both cases, so that any diﬀerence arises only from the small anharmonic
contribution. Results for the thermal energy are not presented here.

The good accuracy of PIC for thermal pressure and thermal energy explains
why it has also been found to give a good account of shock measurements
(Wasserman et al. (1996)). A conventional sequence of shock experiments on
samples in the same initial state generates a path through thermodynamic
state-space known as the Hugoniot. On this path, the pressure p, volume V
and internal energy E are related by the Rankine-Hugoniot formula (Poirier
(2000)):

1
2

(p + p0)(V0 − V ) = E − E0 ,

(14)

where p0, V0 and E0 refer to the initial state, which usually corresponds to
ambient conditions. For given V , the Hugoniot p and temperature T can be de-
termined by going to the calculated p(V, T ) and E(V, T ) functions and seeking
the value of T for which p and E satisfy eqn (14). Fig. 5 shows our calculated
PIC p(V ) on the Hugoniot compared with the experimental results and with
the fully correlated results of Alf`e et al. (2001). The almost exact agreement
between the three sets of results conﬁrms the excellence of PIC for this par-
ticular purpose. Similar comparisons are shown for the T (p) relation on the
Hugoniot in Fig. 6. Here there is a discreprancy, which corresponds to a dif-
ference in internal energy between the two theoretical models. This diﬀerence
is fully accounted for by the neglect of temperature dependence of ¯ω in the
present work.

We conclude the presentation of results by examining three thermodynamic
quantities for which our comparisons between vibrationally correlated calcula-
tions and the earlier PIC results of Wasserman et al. (1996) and Stixrude et al.
(1997) revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences (Alf`e et al. (2001)).

Fig. 7 compares the present PIC results for thermal expansivity α with earlier
calculations. At 2000 K, the present results are in very close agreement with
the vibrationally correlated results, and in strong disagreement with the earlier
PIC results at low pressures. At higher T , the present results fall somewhat
below both previous sets of results. The product αKT (Fig 8) of expansivity
and isothermal bulk modulus is important in high-pressure work, because it

can sometimes be assumed to be independent of p and T over a wide range
of conditions. The vibrationally correlated calculations showed that for high-
p/high-T hcp Fe constancy with p is a good approximation, but constancy
with T is not. The present PIC results show a reduction of αKT with respect
to vibrationally correlated and earlier PIC results of, at most, around 15% at
6000K.

The thermodynamic Gr¨uneisen parameter γ = V (∂p/∂E)V is particularly im-
portant, because it relates thermal pressure to thermal energy, and assump-
tions about γ are often used in reducing shock data from Hugoniot to isotherm.
The large diﬀerences between the earlier PIC results and the vibrationally-
correlated results for γ are therefore a cause for concern (Alf`e et al. (2001)).
The present PIC results (Fig. 9) agree quite closely with the vibrationally-
correlated results, and this suggests that the cause of the earlier disagreement
was not the PIC approximation itself.

4 Discussion

Our comparisons with more exact calculations have shown that the PIC ap-
proximation gives very good results for a range of important thermodynamic
properties of hcp Fe at Earth’s core conditions. A noteworthy example of this
is that p(V ) on the Hugoniot agrees almost perfectly with the more exact
results. Our analysis of the free energy into diﬀerent components makes clear

why PIC is so good. The perfect-lattice component is exactly the same in the
two approaches. For the harmonic component, the sole requirement for good
results is that the logarithmic derivative d ln ¯ω/d ln V of the geometric mean
frequency ¯ω be correct. But we have seen that for hcp Fe the PIC ¯ω diﬀers from
the ¯ω given by calculation of the full phonon spectrum by an almost constant
factor over a wide range of volumes, so that this requirement is satisﬁed. The
basic reason for this is that the phonon dispersion relations of hcp Fe scale
by a uniform factor with changing volume (see Fig. 3 of Alf`e et al. (2001)).
Finally, the anharmonic component of free energy is very small, and has only
a very minor eﬀect on most thermodynamic functions. The reliability of PIC
actually requires that anharmonic eﬀects be small, since we have shown that
the PIC approximation completely misrepresents these eﬀects in predicting
the wrong sign of the anharmonic free energy.

Surprisingly, even though PIC appears to be so good, we ﬁnd important dis-
crepancies with the earlier PIC results of Stixrude et al. (1997) and Wasserman et al.
(1996). In particular, our calculations of the thermodynamic Gr¨uneisen param-
eter agree much more closely with the calculations of Alf`e et al. (2001). These
discrepancies are clearly not due to PIC itself, but must come from other
technical diﬀerences. We note that in the work of Wasserman et al. (1996),
the PIC calculations actually employed a tight-binding representation of the
total energy function, the parameters in the tight-binding model being ﬁtted
to ab initio calculations. Conceivably, the tight-binding ﬁt might have led to
errors.

Even more surprising is that the strong increase with temperature of the axial

16

c/a ratio predicted by recent PIC calculations is not reproduced at all by the
present PIC work. According to Steinle-Neumann et al. (2001), at the atomic
volume of 7.11 ˚A3, c/a increases from 1.63 to 1.75 as T goes from 2000 to
8000 K, whereas in the present PIC calculations at the similar volume of
7.0 ˚A3, c/a increases only from 1.594 to 1.610 over the same temperature
range. The correctness of the weak c/a variation found here is supported by
preliminary calculations (Alf´e (2002)) using the techniques of Alf`e et al. (2001,
2002). The reasons for this discrepancy are completely unclear at present. The
discrepancy has major implications for our understanding of the Earth’s inner
core, because the recently proposed re-interpretation of the elastic anisotropy
of the inner core appears to depend crucially on a strong T variation of c/a.
We believe it is highly desirable that this question be re-examined by other
research groups.

Our work sheds light on the usefulness of the PIC approximation. Since we
have seen that PIC cannot be relied on for anharmonic contributions, it should
be regarded as a way of calculating the geometric-mean harmonic frequency
¯ω. But PIC requires ab initio calculations on a periodic system in which a
single atom is displaced from its perfect-lattice site. These are precisely the
same calculations that are performed in order to obtain the force-constant
matrix used to compute the full phonon spectrum (Alf`e et al. (2001, 2002)).
For an ab initio method that yields forces on all ions – which includes the
pseudopotential and PAW implementations of DFT, among others – the net
result of the PIC procedure is to discard all the information contained in the
ionic forces, retaining only the variation of total energy with displacement.
There would seem to be no good reason for doing this, rather than using the
force information to compute the force-constant matrix and hence the full
phonon spectrum.

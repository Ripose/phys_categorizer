Seismic motion in urban sites consisting
of blocks in welded contact with a soft
layer overlying a hard half space: II. large
and inﬁnite number of identical
equispaced blocks

Jean-Philippe Groby∗and Armand Wirgin†

August 12, 2013

Abstract

We address the problem of the response to a seismic wave of an ur-
ban site consisting of a large and inﬁnite number (Nb) of identical, eq-
uispaced blocks overlying a soft layer underlain by a hard substratum.
The results of the theoretical analysis, appealing to a space-frequency
mode-matching (MM) technique, are compared to those obtained by a
space-time ﬁnite element (FE) method. The two methods are shown to
give rise to much the same prediction of seismic response for Nb = 10.
The MM technique is also applied to the case Nb =
, notably to
reveal the structure and natural frequencies of the vibration modes of
the urban site. The mechanism of the interaction between blocks and
the ground, as well as that of the collective eﬀects of the blocks, are
studied.
It is shown that the presence of a large number of blocks
modiﬁes the seismic disturbance in a manner which evokes, and may
partially account for, what was observed during many earthquakes in
Mexico City. Disturbances at a much smaller level, induced by a small
number of blocks are studied in the companion paper.

Introduction

The Michoacan earthquake that struck Mexico City in 1985 presented
some particular characteristics which have since been encountered at the
same site and at various other urban sites [32, 25, 27, 22], but usually at a
smaller scale. Other than the fact that the response in downtown Mexico
varied considerably in a spatial sense [14, 33], was quite intense and of very
3min [30, 33, 15]), and
long duration at certain locations (as much as
often took the form of a quasi-monochromatic signal with beatings [28, 33],
a remarkable feature of this earthquake (studied in [15, 6, 18, 19]) was that
such strong motion could be caused by a seismic source so far from the
city (the epicenter was located in the subduction zone oﬀ the Paciﬁc coast,
approximately 350km from Mexico City). It is now recognized [6, 7] that
the characteristics of the abnormal response recorded in downtown Mexico
were partially present in the waves entering into the city (notably 60km
from the city as recorded by the authors of [15]) after having accomplished
their voyage from the source, this being thought to be due to the excitation
of Love and generalized-Rayleigh modes by the irregularities of the crust
[6, 9, 15]).

≈

In the present investigation (as well as in the companion paper), we
focus on the the presence of the built features of the urban site as a com-
plementary explanation of the abnormal response. In the companion paper,
we treat the case of one or two (diﬀerent or identical) built features in the
form of cylindrical blocks. Herein, we study the case of many (10, 20, 40,....,
) identical blocks. Such a conﬁguration is a more realistic representation
∞
of a real city due to the large number of blocks it incorporates, but the
i) cylindrical, ii) identical and iii) peri-
assumptions that the blocks are:
odically arranged, are rather far removed from reality, except in restricted
portions of modern cities and megacities. Nevertheless, these assumptions
are not more unrealistic than random dispositions of blocks with random
sizes [10, 34, 17] and compositions, and have the advantage of enabling a
theoretical analysis which can shed some light on the physical origins of the
above-mentioned exotic phenomena.

The periodic model of cities built on sites with a soft layer overlying a
hard substratum solicited by seismic waves originated in the work of Wir-
gin and Bard [38]. Unfortunately, the theoretical apparatus underlying the
numerical results was not given in this paper (only references were made
to studies that treat this issue, but as most of these references were rela-
tive to problems of electromagnetic waves, they have escaped the attention
of the civil engineering and geophysical communities) and the distance be-
tween blocks in the computational results was taken to be 2000m, which,
in our present opinion, is unrealistically large (unless the blocks represent
skyscrapers, of which there are usually few, and largely-distant one from the
other).

4

The object of the present investigation is thus twofold: i) give the missing
theoretical foundations of the results of [38], and ii) treat cities that are more
realistic than those in [38] and in the companion paper. More speciﬁcally,
we shall address the following questions:

(i) how should one account for the principal features of the seismic re-
sponse in the cases of a relatively-large number of blocks (the case of a
relatively small number of blocks being treated in the companion paper)?
the
(ii) what are the vibrational modes of the global structures (i.e.
superstructure plus the geophysical structure) and what are the mechanisms
of their excitation and interaction?

(iii) what are the repercussions of resonant phenomena on the seismic

response?

(iv) what are the diﬀerences in seismic response between conﬁgurations

with a small and a large number of blocks?

2 Candidate sites

Many earthquake-prone cities and megacities (New Delhi, Tokyo, Mexico
City, Istanbul, San Francisco, Basel, etc.) are built on soft soil underlain
by a hard substratum and contain districts with periodic, or nearly-periodic
arrangements of blocks or buildings. An attempt will be made in the present
investigation to analyze the seismic response of districts of this type in the
two cities, Mexico City and Nice (satellite pictures of which are depicted in
ﬁgs. 1 and 2 respectively).

3 Description of the conﬁgurations

We focus on a portion of a city characterized by a periodic or quasi-
periodic set of identical blocks, assumed to have 2D geometry, with x3 the
ignorable coordinate of a Ox1x2x3 cartesian coordinate system (see ﬁg. 3).
The blocks are in welded contact with the ground underneath which is lo-
cated a horizontal soft layer underlain by a hard half space (see ﬁg. 3). Each
block is composed of one or more buildings, all the blocks have the same
shape (rectangular in the cross-section plane), are of the same size (charac-
terized by two constants, their height b and width w) and composition, and
their separation (center-to-center spacing) is a constant d. For the purpose
of the analysis, each block is homogenized, so that the ﬁnal geometry of the
city is as represented in ﬁg. 4. Fig. 5 represents a cross-section (sagittal
plane) view of the city. Γf is the stress-free surface composed of a ground
portion Γg, assumed to be ﬂat and horizontal, and a portion Γag, consti-
tuting the reunion of the above-ground-level boundaries Γj
Z of the
blocks. The ground ΓG is ﬂat and horizontal, and is the reunion of Γg and
the base segments Γj

Z joining the blocks to the underground.

The medium in contact with, and above, Γf is air, assumed to be the
vacumn (i.e., Γf is stress-free). The medium in contact with, and below ΓG
is the mechanically-soft layer occupying the domain Ω1, which is laterally-
inﬁnite and of thickness h, and whose lower boundary is Γh, assumed to
be ﬂat and horizontal. The soft material in the layer is in welded contact
across Γh with the mechanically-hard material in the semi-inﬁnite domain
(substratum) Ω0.

The seismic disturbance is delivered to the site in the form of a shear-
horizontal (SH) plane pulse wave, initially propagating in Ω0. The SH nature
of the incident wave (which fact is indicated by the superscript i in the
following) means that the motion associated with it is strictly transverse
(i.e., in the x3 direction and independent of the x3 coordinate). Both the
SH polarization and the invariance of the incident wave with respect to x3
are communicated to the ﬁelds that are generated at the site in response to
the incident wave. Thus, our analysis will deal only with the propagation
of 2D SH waves (i.e., waves that depend exclusively on the two cartesian
coordinates x1, x2 and that are associated with motion in the x3 direction
only).

We shall be concerned with a description of the elastodynamic waveﬁeld
on the free surface (i.e., on Γf ) resulting from plane seismic wave solicitation
of the site.

conﬁguration involves three homogeneous media and the solicitation takes

a positive real constant with respect to ω, i.e., µ0(ω) = µ0 > 0.

4.3 Space-frequency and space-time framework expressions

of the incident plane wave

As mentioned above, we shall be concerned with plane wave excitation

of the city.

Actually, a plane wave satisﬁes the homogeneous wave equation in the
space-time framework and a homogeneous Helmholtz equation in the space-
frequency framework.

The ﬁeld is chosen to take the form of a pseudo Ricker-type pulse in
the space-time framework, whose shape is directly connected with the site
we will consider in the numerical application (either a Nice-like site, or a
Mexico city -like site) .

4.3.1 Space-frequency-framework representation of the plane, im-

pulsive, incident wave

In both cases, α = π/tp, tp is the characteristic period of the pulse, and
ts the time at which the pulse attains its maximal value. In particular we
will chose tp = ts = 1
ν0 , where ν0 is the central frequency (in Hz) of the
spectrum of the pulse.

4.4 Boundary and radiation conditions in the space-time

framework

Since our ﬁnite element method [16, 17] for solving the wave equation
in a heterogeneous medium M (in our case, involving three homogeneous
components, M 0, M 1 and M 2) relies on the assumption that M is a contin-
uum, it does not appeal to any boundary conditions except on Γf where the
vanishing traction condition is invoked. The latter is modeled with the help
of the ﬁctitious domain method [2], which allows us to model diﬀraction
of waves by a boundary of complicated geometry, not necessarily matching
the volumic mesh. Furthermore, since the essentially unbounded nature of
the geometry of the city cannot be implemented numerically, we take the
geometry to be ﬁnite and surround it (except on the Γf portion) by a PML
perfectly-matched layer [12] which enables closure of the computational do-
main without generating unphysical reﬂected waves (from the PML layer).
In a sense, this replaces the radiation condition of the unbounded domain.

4.5 Boundary and radiation conditions in the space-frequency

domain

The translation of the stress-free (i.e., vanishing traction) nature of Γf =

The new feature in the present investigation is the possibility of the exis-

Owing to the plane wave nature of the incident wave, the periodic nature
of ΓG, and the fact that the blocks are assumed to be identical in height,
width, and composition, one can show that the ﬁeld is quasi-periodic (this

7 Modal Analysis

7.1 General considerations

At this point, it is important to recall that the ultimate goal of this
investigation is to predict the response of an urban site to a seismic wave.
This response takes the form of the displacement ﬁeld at various locations
on the ground as a function of time. Thus, the ﬁeld quantities of interest
are the space-time expressions of uj ; j = 0, 1, 2.

On account of what was written above (see (4) and (24)), the space-time

framework diﬀracted ﬁeld in Ω0 can be written as

(58)
with similar types of expressions for the ﬁelds in Ω1 and Ω2, as well as for the
(incident) excitation ﬁeld. These expressions possess at least four important
features.

(cid:3)(cid:9)

(cid:8)

(cid:2)

The ﬁrst feature, underlined in [18] and [19], is that the time frame-
work ﬁelds are expressed as integrals over the horizontal wavenumber k1
and angular frequency ω of functions that represent, for each k1 and ω (and
assuming there is no material attenuation in the media), either a propagat-
ing or evanescent plane wave, the amplitude of which is a function such as
B0(k1, ω).

A second important feature, underlined in [18], [19] and in the com-
panion paper, is that the amplitude functions, such as B0(k1, ω), exhibit
resonant behavior (i.e., can become large in the presence of material losses,
or even larger (and sometimes, inﬁnite) in the absence of material losses),
1 of k1 and ω⋆ of ω, which are
in the neighborhood of certain values, k
characteristic of the modes of the structure giving rise to these ﬁelds.

⋆

The third feature, brought out in [18], [19], is that resonances can be
provoked by the solicitation when: a) the frequency ω of one of the spectral
components of the latter is equal to one of the natural frequencies ω⋆ and
b) the horizontal wavenumber of one of the component plane waves of the
excitation ﬁeld is equal to k

⋆
1 .

larger than

k

k
k1k
k

The fourth feature is that a mode (such as the well-known Love mode)
k0
corresponds to
, which means that the plane wave
k
k
associated with an excited mode is necessarily evanescent in Ω0. Conse-
(which is a sort of momentum) up to the required
quently, to bring
level, requires a momentum boost, which is provided either by the incident
ﬁeld (i.e., the latter should contain evanescent wave components with hori-
) and/or by the scattering structure (site)
zontal wavenumbers
k
itself.

k1k
k

k0
|

>

In [18], [19], the site had horizontal, ﬂat boundaries and interfaces and
all the media were homogeneous, so that it could not provide the required

19

momentum boost. Moreover, it was shown in [18], [19] that if the incident
ﬁeld takes the form of a propagating (bulk) plane wave, the (Love) modes
of the site cannot be excited, this being possible only if the incident ﬁeld
contains the required evanescent wave component, as is the situation in
which the wave is radiated by a line source.

Herein, the incident ﬁeld takes the form of a propagating plane wave and
the momentum boost is provided by the periodic uneveness of the surface (in
quanta of 2π
d ), as manifested by the presence of evanescent waves in the ﬁeld
representations, so that we can expect the conﬁguration to exhibit resonant
behavior corresponding to the excitation of some sort of modes.

The remainder of this section is devoted to the characterization of these

modes and to the methods for ﬁnding the (k
associated.

from which it becomes apparent that the solution B0(l)
n , to any order l of
approximation, is expressed as a fraction, the denominator of which (not
depending on the order of approximation), can become small for certain
values of k1n and ω so as to make B0(l)
n (ω), and (possibly) the ﬁeld in the
substratum, large at these values.

When this happens, a natural mode of the conﬁguration, comprising the
blocks, the soft layer and the hard half substratum, is excited, this tak-
ing the form of a resonance with respect to B0(l)
n , i.e., with respect to the
ﬁeld in the substratum. As B0

structural resonance also manifests itself in the layer for the same k1n and ω.

n δnm, D has components

modes of the conﬁguration are obtained by turning oﬀ the excitation [38],
embodied in the vector f . Thus, the non-trivial solution of the homogeneous
matrix equation (66) is the solution of (the dispersion relation)

to an approximation of the dispersion equation of the modes (67) when the

D are small compared to the
diagonal elements. Such a situation does not necessarily prevail, but it
is nevertheless useful to obtain a ﬁrst idea of the natural frequencies of
the modes from the simple relations (68) rather than from the much more
complicated relation (67).

−

As shown in the companion paper (section 6.2), and in [18, 19], it is
impossible to excite a Love mode in a conﬁguration without blocks consisting
of a soft layer overlying a hard halfspace when the incident wave is a plane
bulk wave. This case corresponds to b

which shows that the modes of the conﬁguration result from the interaction

Each of these two substructures possesses its own modes, i.e., arising from

F1m = 0, for the superstructure, and
modes of the complete structure are neither the modes of the superstructure
nor those of the substructure, since they are deﬁned by

F1m(k1, ω)

which again emphasizes the fact that the modes of the complete structure
result from the interaction of the modes of the component structures.

In order to obtain the natural frequencies of the complete structure, we
ﬁrst analyze the natural frequencies of each substructure, and assume that
all the media are non-dissipative (i.e. elastic).

Next consider the dispersion relations for the geophysical (sub)structure
N. As pointed out in the companion paper, the sum
F2m(k1, ω) = 0 ; m
in this relation can be split into three parts corresponding to:
i) propaga-
tive waves in both the substratum and the layer, ii) evanescent waves in the
substratum and propagative waves the layer, iii) evanescent waves in both
the substratum and layer. Only the second part can lead to a vanishing
denominator, and also to the satisfaction of the dispersion relation of Love
modes.

7.3.2 Approximate dispersion relations resulting from a second

type of iterative scheme

Let Q denote the matrix of components Qml, I the identity matrix, and

b and p the vectors of components B2

l and Pl respectively.

The system of linear equations (55) can be written as the matrix equation

(for the determination of the unknown vector b)

The modes of the conﬁguration are obtained by turning oﬀ the excitation
[37], embodied in p. The non-trivial solutions of (80) are then obtained from

(80)

An iterative (partition) procedure for solving this equation, which is diﬀer-
ent from the preceding one, and is particularly appropriate if the oﬀ-diagonal
elements of the matrix are small (but non neglected) compared to the diago-
nal elements, is ﬁrst to consider the matrix to have one row and one column,

(actually, in most of the cited publications, M 2 was also taken equal to M 0,
but this is not done here, for the moment at least). Thus, µ1 = µ0 and
k1 = k0. In addition, we recall that M 0 is non-dissipative, so that µ0 and
k0 are real. We shall also suppose, to simplify matters, that µ2 and k2 are
real (i.e., M 2 is lossless).

This relation, ﬁrst published in [21], shows that even if M 2 is non-dispersive
(recall that it was assumed, from the start, that M 0 is non-dispersive), then
the phase velocity of the Cutler mode is dispersive, i.e., c1 = c1(ω) (which,
of course, is the reason why one speaks of a dispersion relation in connection
with a (e.g., Cutler) mode).

Remark
The phase velocity of the Cutler mode is all the closer to the phase velocity
of bulk waves in M 0 for all ω, the smaller is κ. On the contrary, for a Cutler
mode with phase velocity very diﬀerent from that of bulk waves in M 0, we
must have a large contrast between the material properties of M 0 and M 2.

Let us now inquire as to the means of actually exciting a Cutler mode
with an incident plane bulk wave. At ﬁrst, this seems impossible (for the
same reason it is not possible to excite a Love mode with an incident plane
bulk wave). But we must not forget that the ﬁeld in Ω0 is composed not
only of diﬀracted plane bulk waves, but also of diﬀracted evanescent waves,
the possibility of these waves to exist being due to the uneven (at present,
periodically uneven) geometry of the stress-free surface at the site.

The discussion concerning the Cutler mode began with the assumptions:
i) the term in the expression of the diﬀracted ﬁeld in Ω0 corresponding to
the N -th order diﬀracted plane wave dominates all the other terms, and ii)
this diﬀracted wave is an evanescent wave, i.e., k0
In the
dispersion equation context, k1 is a variable that has no particular connec-
tion with the solicitation. When the site is solicited by a plane bulk wave,
1 = k0 sin θi the factor directly related to the

cent wave (whose phase velocity is smaller than that of the bulk wave, and
whose horizontal wavenumber is therefore larger than the wavenumber k0
of the incident bulk wave).

In order for a resonance to occur in the N -th order mode, the frequency
of one of the components of the spectrum of the excitation must be equal to
a natural frequency of the mode. Although this is a necessary condition, it is

A remark is in order concerning what happens when R0 is not neglected
D0. The subset, in this remainder term, involving
in the expression of
the n for which k2n is imaginary (i.e., corresponding to evanescent waves),
will modify somewhat the (real) solutions of what formerly constituted the
Cutler dispersion relation, whereas the subset involving the n for which k2n
is real (i.e., corresponding to propagative waves) adds an imaginary part
to the (real) solutions of what formerly constituted the Cutler dispersion
relation. Thus, the evanescent Cutler wave becomes a leaky wave, i.e., a
wave with complex k1.

7.3.4 Solution of the zeroth-order dispersion relation when M 1

=

M 0: the quasi-Cutler mode

The dispersion relation (84) has been studied in [36] and is a subset of
the dispersion relations analyzed in sect. 7.2. Not much more, other than
what is revealed by a numerical analysis, can be added to the text in sects.
7.2 and 7.3.3, due to the complexity of (84).

To make a long story short, one ﬁnds that the presence of the layer
transforms the Cutler mode into a quasi Cutler mode which is all the closer
to a Cutler mode the smaller is the layer thickness h and/or the closer the
material parameters of the layer are to those of the substratum. If, on the
other hand, h is not very small, and/or the material parameters of the layer
are very diﬀerent from those of the substratum, then the quasi-Cutler mode
becomes an entity entirely diﬀerent from that of the Cutler mode; in fact,
it ressembles a Love mode, so that it is better to represent the phenomena
in terms of quasi-Love modes (as in sect. 7.2) than in terms of quasi-Cutler
modes.

8.4 Comments on the ﬁelds u1 and u2

Expressions (107) and (108) indicate that both displacement ﬁelds
u1(x, ω) and u2(x, ω) are composed of: i) the ﬁeld obtained in the absence
of the blocks and induced in the layer or substratum by the incident plane
wave, ii) the ﬁeld induced by the presence of the blocks, which appears as
a ﬁeld radiated by an inﬁnite number of identical source distributions (each
one related to a given block). In particular, each of these induced sources
takes the form of a ribbon source of width w located at the base segment of a

30

block when it is related to the zeroth-order quasi-mode (see the companion
paper).

When a mode is excited (i.e., at a resonance frequency), one or several of
the B2
m can become large, in which case it is possible for the ﬁelds to become
large at resonance. This will be demonstrated in the numerical examples
which follow.

9 Numerical results for the seismic response in

two idealized cities

9.1 Preliminaries

The numerical results are obtained in two manners:

i) by the Mode-
Matching (MM) method (described in the previous section) as it applies to
conﬁgurations consisting of an inﬁnite number of equally-spaced, equally-
sized rectangular blocks, and ii) by the Finite-Element (FE) method (brieﬂy
described in the companion paper, and in more detail in [16, 17]) as it applies
to conﬁgurations with a large (but ﬁnite) number of equally-spaced, equally-
sized rectangular blocks.

The discussions concerning the numerical aspects of the dispersion rela-
tions will be based on material stemming from the MM. For the purpose of
the analysis, and to allow for an easier comparison with the results exposed
in the companion paper, we re-write (the lowest-order approximation of the
dispersion relation) (84) in the form

9.2.1 Parameters

The sources of earthquakes in the city of Nice (France) are usually deep
and located almost vertically below the Nice site (a few kilometers laterally
from the city). Modeling the solicitation of the site by a normally-incident
(i.e., θi = 0, which leads to ki
1 = 0) plane incident wave is thus realistic [32].
The central frequency of the Ricker pulse associated with the solicitation is
chosen to be ν0 = 2Hz.

nature of the distribution of blocks, which manifests itself by the quasi-
Cutler modes, probably appears at frequencies higher than those in the
range of the ﬁgure.

9.2.3 Comparison of responses for Nb = 10 and Nb =

∞

We now compare both the spectra and time histories for an inﬁnite
number of identical blocks with those of a ﬁnite number (i.e., 10) of the
same blocks. The point of observation is at the center of the top segment
of a block. The block under examination is the leftmost one in ﬁg. 7, and
the ﬁfth one in ﬁg. 8. Since the angle of incidence is 0, both the spectra
and time histories of response do not change from one block to another in
structure. We note the close similarity of both the frequency
the Nb =
and time domain responses relative to the Nb = 10 and Nb =
structures,
even for the leftmost block of the ﬁnite conﬁguration. This means that for a
Nice-like site, the model involving an inﬁnite number of identical blocks can
used to model and/or to analyze the response phenomena in such a city.

Other than this, as concerns the response spectra, the left-most peak at
3.2 Hz seem to be related to the
1.1 Hz and the rightmost peak at

excitation of the Haskell pseudo-modes (which is another way of saying that
the corresponding quasi-Love modes are weakly excited, since these peaks
would exist even if the buildings had nearly zero height). The large peak
in the response spectra at
2.5Hz is associated with the excitation of the
quasi-displacement free base block mode, as expected from examination of
the solutions of the dispersion relation (see ﬁg. 6). The lengthening of

the duration (
≈
incident pulse of
1 sec, is mainly due to the excitation of this mode, but
since the quality factor of the resonance of this mode is relatively small,
the lengthening of the duration is relatively-modest. Thus, it seems that
both the ampliﬁcation of the amplitude, and the lengthening of duration, of
seismic motion in a periodic or quasi-periodic portion of Nice, cannot take
catastrophic proportions. Insofar as this conclusion concerns the amplitude
of ground motion, it is in agreement with the conclusions in [32].

9.3 Finite and inﬁnite number of blocks in a Mexico City-like

site

9.3.1 Parameters

The sources of the major earthquakes in Mexico City have usually been
shallow and located in the subduction zone oﬀ the Paciﬁc coast, approxi-
mately 350km from Mexico City), so that modeling the solicitation of this
city by a plane incident bulk wave is not realistic [18, 19]. Nevertheless, we
assume such a (normally-incident) plane bulk wave solicitation, notably to
enable an easy quantitative comparison between the ﬁnite and inﬁnite city
responses and qualitative comparison with previous studies [38, 10, 32, 4, 5].
The central frequency of the Ricker pulse associated with the solicitation is
chosen to be ν0 = 0.5Hz.

The underground of the city is characterized by: ρ0 = 2000 kg/m3,
ref =60 m/s, Q1 = 30, with the
c0=600 m/s, Q0 =
soft layer thickness being h = 50 m. The Haskell frequencies are 0.3Hz,

, ρ1 = 1300 kg/m3, c1

0.9Hz, 1.5Hz,....

The blocks are 50m high, 30m in width, and their center-to-center spac-
ing are successively chosen to be 65m, 150m and 300m. The material con-
ref =100m/s, Q2 = 100. The
stants of the blocks are: ρ2 = 325 Kg/m3, c2
natural frequencies of the displacement-free base block modes are νSF B
m =
0.5Hz, 1.5Hz,..., and the quasi-Cutler mode natural frequencies (which are
speciﬁc to the periodic nature of the site, with characteristic dimension d),
are obtained from

= 0.

9.3.2 Dispersion characteristics of the modes for an inﬁnite num-

F

ber of blocks

Fig. 9 gives indications concerning the solutions of the dispersion rela-
tion of the global conﬁguration (i.e., blocks plus underground) for center-to-
center spacings d = 65m, d = 150m and d = 300m. For a center-to-center
spacing d = 65m, the inﬂuence of the periodic nature of the city (embod-
ied in the parameter d) appears essentially at a high frequency outside the
spectral bandwidth of the solicitation, while for d = 150m and d = 300m,
this inﬂuence can make itself felt in the spectral range of the solicitation
through the quasi-Cutler modes. Quasi-Love and quasi-displacement free
base block modes should be excited at
0.5Hz respectively,
both associated with a low attenuation. The stress-free base block mode is
excited at

1Hz, but is highly-attenuated for all three d.

0.3Hz and

≈

≈

Quasi-Cutler modes are clearly excited with a low attenuation. In par-
ticular, for a relatively large center-to-center spacing (i.e. d = 300), the
spectral density of this type of mode is large. The fundamental quasi-Love
natural frequency is probably very close to the fundamental quasi-Cutler
natural frequency.

9.3.3 Seismic response for an inﬁnite number of blocks with pe-

riod d = 65m compared to that of no blocks

In ﬁg. 10 we compare the spectra and time histories in the presence and

absence of the d = 65 set of blocks.

The ﬁrst resonance peak in the spectra is shifted to a lower frequency
and is of higher amplitude when the blocks are present. This is the in-
dication of the excitation of the fundamental quasi-Love mode responsible
for what was termed the soil-structure interaction in the companion paper.
The peak relative to the excitation of the perturbed displacement-free base
block mode has a relatively high amplitude, due to both the spectrum of
the incident wave and to the presence of the other blocks. Eﬀectively, the
resonance frequency does not correspond to that of the displacement-free
base block mode (at which frequency the response is nil at the center of the
base segment of the block), and the particular shape of the spectrum at the

center of the base segment of the block is characteristic of the excitation of a
multi-displacement-free base block mode and not to the excitation of a quasi
displacement-free base block mode (as shown in the companion paper). This
coupled mode also takes into account the so-called structure-soil-structure
interaction as (see the companion paper) was suggested in sect. 7.3.

A splitting of the ﬁrst peak appears in the ground (between the blocks)
response. The second of the split peaks has a low quality factor, which fact
means the quasi-absence of beatings in the time history of response.

The temporal displacements are of higher amplitude and duration in the
presence of blocks than in the absence of blocks, particularly at the center of
the top segment of the block. These results are evocative of those obtained
in the companion paper for two blocks.

9.3.4 Comparison of the seismic responses for one, two and an
inﬁnite number of blocks with center-to-center separations
d = 65m

In ﬁg. 11, we compare the spectra and time histories of response for
one-block, two-block, and inﬁnite-block conﬁgurations at the center of the
top segment of one of the blocks. This ﬁgure shows that the eﬀect of in-
creasing the number of blocks is essentially to increase the height of the
second (i.e., higher-frequency) resonance peak at the expense of the ﬁrst
resonance peak, and thus to introduce stronger high-frequency oscillations
in the temporal response. As the quality factor of the second resonance peak
increases with Nb, the durations also increase with Nb. The combined eﬀect
of the increased quality factors and higher frequency oscillations is increased
cumulative motion of the block.

In ﬁg. 12, we compare the spectra and time histories of seismic response
for one-block, two-block, and inﬁnite-block conﬁgurations at the center of
the bottom segment of one of the blocks. Since the second resonance now is
synonymous with a minimum of response, the aforementioned eﬀects are not
produced at the base of the block. In fact, with increasing Nb, we actually
observe a decrease of the height of the ﬁrst resonance peak, whose eﬀect is
to decrease the amplitude and duration of motion in the time histories.

In ﬁg. 13 we compare the spectra and time histories of seismic response
at the center of the top segment of a centrally-located block in conﬁgurations
30m blocks separated by
with 10, 20, 40 and an inﬁnite number of 50m
d = 65m. On the whole, these displacement responses are all the same, in
both the frequency and time domains, marked by relatively-long duration
duration (
2 min), and large maximum and cumulative amplitudes. How-
ever, for the ﬁnite values of Nb, there appears some splitting of the Nb =
∞
low frequency resonance peak which gives rise to beatings in addition to
those due to the presence of the two main resonance peaks.

In ﬁg. 14 we compare the spectra and time histories of seismic response
at the center of the bottom segment of a central block in conﬁgurations
with 10, 20, 40 and an inﬁnite number of 50m
30m blocks separated by
d = 65m. The splittings referred-to in the previous lines are now more
apparent and give rise to more pronounced beatings, especially for the 10
and 20 block conﬁgurations. These beatings are absent for the Nb =
city.
The durations are quite long for the 10 and 20 block conﬁgurations, and, on
the whole, the signals are evocative of what has been often observed during
earthquakes in certain districts of Mexico City.

In ﬁg. 15 we compare the spectra and time histories of seismic response
at the midpoint on the ground between two adjacent centrally-located blocks
in conﬁgurations with 10, 20, 40 and an inﬁnite number of 50m
30m blocks
separated by d = 65m. Again, we observe two main resonance peaks for all
Nb, giving rise to characteristic beatings, to which are added other beatings
due to splittings of the ﬁrst resonance peak, especially noticeable for ﬁnite
Nb. This response is again quite evocative of ground response observed in
the midst of certain districts of Mexico City during many earthquakes that
have aﬀected this city [8].

The presence of the additional low-frequency peaks in this set of ﬁgures
is linked either to the (ﬁnite) number of blocks considered and/or to the
total width W of the ﬁnite conﬁguration (for N = 10, 20, 40, W is equal
to 650m, 1300, 2600m respectively). These peaks cannot be accounted-for

Illustration of the spatial variability of response in a con-
ﬁguration of ten blocks for center-to-center separations d =
65m

Fig. 16 depicts snapshots of the displacement ﬁeld in the entire conﬁgu-
ration containing ten blocks whose center-to-center distance is d = 65m. It
can be noticed that: i) the motions are still quite strong in portions of the
conﬁguration some 50s after the arrival of the initial pulse and ii) that the
motion is quite variable spatially- and temporally-speaking, iii) the spatial
variability extends even to within a given block.

The spatial variability of response is one of the characteristics of the

motion that has often been recorded within Mexico City [14, 8].

9.3.7 Comparison of responses of the conﬁguration without blocks

to the one with Nb =

blocks for d = 300m

∞

In ﬁg. 17, we compare the spectra and time histories in the presence and
in the absence of the blocks. When the blocks are present, their number is
inﬁnite and their center-to-center distance is 300m.

The excitation of the multi displacement-free base block mode cannot be
clearly distinguished because of the excitation of quasi-Cutler modes whose
existence is related to the periodic nature of the block distribution. Note
should be taken of the fact that now (i.e., for d = 300m) these modes are
visible (with a large quality factor) within the bandwidth of the solicitation,
whereas they were invisible for the d = 65m periodic structure. As previ-
ously, the soil-structure interaction appears as a resonance peak associated
with the excitation of the fundamental quasi-Love mode.

These features show up at all three locations of the conﬁguration with
blocks. They manifest themselves in the time domain by: i) a larger duration
(multiplied by
4 on the top segment of the blocks with respect to its value
in the absence of the blocks), ii) a larger peak amplitude (at the top of the
blocks) and larger cumulative motion, and iii) pronounced beatings at all
locations due to the periodic nature of the conﬁguration.

≈

These features are once again evocative of those which have been ob-
served during earthquakes in certain districts Mexico City. However, the
excitation of the quasi-Cutler mode, which is strongly-linked to the quasi-
periodic or periodic nature of a district of the city (these districts actually
exist, as seen in ﬁg. 1), can, at best, explain only part of the features of
response in this city, since the latter is not usually solicited by a (normally-
incident) plane wave.

It has been shown in the companion paper, and in [18, 19] that the correct
solicitation of a conﬁguration for the study of the Michoacan earthquake
(and many other earthquakes aﬀecting Mexico City) is a cylindrical wave
radiated by a shallow, laterally-distant source that gives rise to Love waves
after traveling within the crust from the hypocenter to the city.
In the
same studies, it was shown that this type of solicitation is another cause for
the large duration, large amplitude, and beatings of Mexico City response.
Unfortunately, source wave solicitation cannot be treated by the quasi-modal
analysis of periodic structures.

9.3.8 Comparison of the MM and FEM results for a ﬁnite set of

blocks whose separation is d =300m

We now compare, in ﬁgs. 18, 19 and 20, the results computed by the
mode-matching technique (accounting for the fundamental quasi-mode of
the blocks), for an inﬁnite number of equally-spaced identical blocks, with
those we obtain by our ﬁnite-element method, for a ﬁnite number Nb = 10
of equally-spaced identical blocks. In this case, B =
, with the
1, 2, ..., 10
}
{
block numbers 1 and 10 being located at the left and right edges respectively
of the ﬁnite conﬁguration.

The width of the ﬁnite set of blocks W is 3000m and therefore closer
(than in the previous case) to the inﬁnite width implicit in the MM theory.
This may be the reason why the FE results agree quite well with the MM
results within the city. The two computational modes match less well at a
point on the ground outside the city (ﬁg. 20), as one would expect.

One observes that the response is spatially variable, of long duration
(attaining at some points
2 min), with high maximum and cumulative
amplitudes, and characterized by beating features, which is quite evocative
of the features of many sismograms of Mexico City earthquakes [8, 14, 33,
15]. This suggests that rather largely-spaced blocks or buildings are more
apt than closely-spaced blocks or buildings to induce the large-scale features
(particularly the very long durations and beatings) observed in this city.

Illustration of the spatial variablility of response in a con-
ﬁguration of ten blocks separated by d = 300m

Fig. 21 contains three snapshots, at instants t=25s, 32.5s and 50s, of
the displacement ﬁeld in the entire conﬁguration of 10 blocks with center-
to-center separation of 300m. Once again, one notes both the large- and
small-scale spatio-temporal variability of response in the city site.

10 Conclusions

The response, to a plane wave initially propagating in the substratum,
of a ﬁnite set of identical, equi-spaced blocks, each block modeling one, or
a group of buildings, in welded contact with a soft layer overlying a hard
half space, was investigated in a theoretical manner via the mode matching
technique.

The capacity of this technique to account for the complex phenomena
provoked by the presence of blocks on the ground was demonstrated by
comparison of the numerical results to which it leads to those obtained by
a ﬁnite element method.

It was shown that the presence of the blocks induces a modiﬁcation of

54

the phenomena that are produced by the conﬁguration without blocks, or
of a conﬁguration of closed blocks disconnected from the geophysical half-
space. In particular, the blocks modify the dispersion relation of what, in the
absence of the blocks, constitutes the Love modes. Moreover, the periodic
nature of the urban site is responsible for the existence of another vibrational
mode which is a variant of the Cutler mode encountered in electromagnetic
waveguide structures.

The dispersion relation for the periodic conﬁgurations with an inﬁnite
number of blocks is very complex, but an approximation of this relation
lends itself to a fairly-explicit theoretical analysis, inspired notably by the
method ﬁrst adopted in the electromagnetic wave community. The general
features of this dispersion relation, revealed by the theoretical analysis (and
manifested by the existence of several types of vibrational modes), were
shown to actually exist by means of the numerical study.

The excitation of the vibrational modes was then studied in the par-
ticular case of city districts with 10 and an inﬁnite number of identical,
periodically-disposed blocks. A common feature of the inﬂuence of the
blocks is the excitation of the quasi-Love mode, which occurs even for so-
licitation by a plane wave (recall that, for this type of solicitation, it is not
possible to excite ordinary Love modes in a ﬂat ground (i.e., no blocks)/soft
horizontal layer/hard substratum conﬁguration [18]). The trace of quasi-
Love mode excitation in the frequency domain was shown to be a shift
to lower frequency and an increase of the amplitude of the ﬁrst (lowest-
frequency) peak of the response.

The change of the phenomena provoked by plane wave solicitation, from
a conﬁguration without blocks (for which there exist only bulk waves in
the geophysical structure), to one with blocks (for which there exist quasi-
Love modes characterized by a ﬁeld in the substratum that is predominantly
a surface wave in the substratum) is a manifestation of the so-called soil-
structure interaction.

Multi displacement-free base block modes were shown to be excited in

all the conﬁgurations and to correspond to a coupled mode.

The modiﬁcations of the response due to the presence of blocks separated

by 65m were found to be rather modest in the Nice-like site.

The modiﬁcations of the frequency-domain response (and less so of the
time-domain response) were found to be fairly substantial for structures in-
volving blocks separated by 65m in the Mexico City-like site. In particular,
10 or 20 blocks separated by 65m, were shown to give rise to anomalous
features (ampliﬁcations of peak and cumulative motion, large durations and
beatings) that are even closer to those observed in Mexico City than conﬁg-
urations with a larger number (40,

) of blocks.

All the anomalous features found for the Mexico City-like site with 10 or
an inﬁnite number of blocks were found to be closer to the actually-observed
anomalous features observed during earthquakes in Mexico City when the

∞

separation between blocks is 300m rather than 65m. This was found to
be due to the fact that the structure with the larger period enables the
quasi-Cutler mode to make itself felt within the range of frequencies of the
source.

The theoretical ﬁndings and numerical results of the present study can-
not account for all the anomalous phenomena observed in many of the earth-
quakes in Mexico City (notably the exceptionally-long durations) for the
obvious reasons that the model adopted herein, i.e., SH plane wave solicita-
tion, 2D, periodic geometries, simple underground (horizontal homogeneous
soft layer of inﬁnite lateral extent overlying a homogeneous lossless hard
substratum), simple homogenized building blocks, linear soil behavior, etc.,
is incomplete, and in some respects, rather far removed from reality. Never-
theless, the results of our study indicate that it is possible that the excitation
of vibrational modes, whose structure is closely-related to those described
herein, was responsible for at least part of the large-scale, anomalous me-
chanical eﬀects that have caused so much damage in past earthquakes in
urban areas.

The most important ﬁnding of this work, which substantiates those ob-
tained in [38, 34, 17], is that the presence of groups of buildings (i.e., city
blocks) can modify substantially the seismic motion in a city. Moreover,
provided the blocks are arranged quasi-periodically with a suﬃciently large
period d, the seismic motion is of longer duration, and of higher cumulative
(sometimes peak) amplitude on the ground (and, of course, in the buildings)
than when the built structures are not present.

Therefore, it is advisable to integrate (as is starting to be done [13])
the presence, composition and layout, of buildings, together with, and to
the same extent as, the features of the underground structure and compo-
sition, into the large-scale computer codes that are being employed [35] to
predict the level and durations of shaking in highly-populated, economically-
important, earthquake-prone areas.

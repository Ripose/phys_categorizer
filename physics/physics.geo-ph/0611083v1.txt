1 Introduction

Earthquakes occur on the earth’s surface as a result of rearrangement of ter-
restrial cortex or higher part of the mantle. The energy released in this process
propagates over long distances in the form of elastic seismic waves [1]. In or-
der to predict earthquakes many models have been proposed [2, 3]. Dynamics
of an earthquake is so complicated that it is quite diﬃcult to predict using
available models. Seismicity is a classic example of a complex phenomenon
that can be quantiﬁed using fractal concepts [4].

In this paper we have estimated the fractal dimension, maximum, as well
as minimum of the singularities, and the half-width of the multifractal spec-
trum of the El Salvador Earthquake signal at diﬀerent stations. The data has
been taken from the California catalogue (http://nsmp.wr.usgs.gov/nsmn
eqdata.html). The paper has been arranged as follows: In section 2 the ba-
sic theory of multifractality has been discussed, and the results have been
presented in section 3 .

2 Multifractal Analysis

The H¨older exponent of a time series f (t) at the point t0 is given by the
largest exponent such that there exists a polynomial Pn(t − t0) of the order
of n satisfying [5, 6, 7]

|f (t) − pn(t − t0)| ≤ C|t − t0|α(t0)

(1)

The polynomial Pn(t − t0) corresponds to the Taylor series of f (t) around
t = t0, up to n. The exponent α measures the irregularities of the function f .
Higher positive value of α(t0) indicates regularity in the function f . Negative
α indicates spike in the signal. If n < α < n + 1 it can be proved that the
function f is n times diﬀerentiable but not n + 1 times at the point t0 [8].

All the H¨older exponents present in the time series are given by the sin-
gularity spectrum D(α). This can be determined from the Wavelet Transform
Modulus Maxima(WTMM). Before proceeding to ﬁnd out the exponents α
using wavelet analysis, we discuss about the wavelet transform.

2.1 Wavelet Analysis

In order to understand wavelet analysis, we have to ﬁrst understand ‘What
is a wavelet ?’. A wavelet is a waveform of eﬀectively limited duration that
has an average value of zero, shown in the ﬁgure 1 (bottom). The diﬀerence
of wavelets to sine waves, which are the basis of Fourier analysis, is that
sinusoids do not have limited duration, but they extend from minus to plus

inﬁnity. And where sinusoids are smooth and predictable, wavelets tend to be
irregular and asymmetric. For example, ‘gaus4’ wavelet (Fig. 1(bottom)) is
deﬁned as ψ(t) = dN
/2, where N =4. Fourier analysis breaks up a signal
into sine waves of various frequencies. Similarly, wavelet analysis breaks up
a signal into shifted and scaled versions of the original (or mother) wavelet.
It can be intuitively understood that signals with sharp changes might be
better analyzed with an irregular wavelet than with a smooth sinusoid. Local
features can be described better with wavelets that have local extent.

Wavelet transform can be deﬁned as

W f (s, b) =

f (t)ψ(

where s, and b are the scale and time respectively. In order to detect singular-
ities we will further require ψ to be orthogonal to some low-order polynomials
[8]:

for example, the wavelet in Figure 1 has four vanishing moments, i.e. N =4.

2.2 Singularity Detection

+∞
−∞ Pn(t − t0)ψ(t) = 0, (if
Since the wavelet has N vanishing moments, so
n < N ) ,and therefore, the wavelet coeﬃcient only detects the singular part
R
of the signal.

W f (s, b) ∼ sα(t0),

a → 0+,

(4)

So, as long as, N > α(t0) the H¨older exponents can be extracted from log-log
plot of the Equation 4 .

2.3 Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima

Let [up(s)]p∈Z be the position of all maxima of |W f (b, s)| at a ﬁxed scale s.
Then the partition function Z is deﬁned as [11]

Z(q, s) =

|W f (b, s)|q

Xp

(5)

(6)

(7)

Z will be calculated from the WTMM. Drawing an analogy from thermody-
namics, one can deﬁne the exponent τ (q) from the power law behavior of the
partition function [9, 10, 11] as

Z(q, s) ∼ aτ (q),

a → 0+,

The log-log plot of Eqn 6 will give the τ (q) of the signal.

Now the multifractal spectrum D(α(q)) vs α(q) can be computed from the

Legendre transform

D(α) = minq (qα − τ (q))

where, the H¨older exponent α = ∂τ (q)
∂q .

3 Results and Discussion

In the present paper we have analyzed the El Salvador earthquake data
recorded at diﬀerent stations as shown in the Table 1. In this table we have
arranged the stations according to their distances from the epicenter.

Wavelet analysis of the data recorded at diﬀerent stations shows that the
major events of the earthquake have taken place at short time scales. For eg.
Fig 2(top) shows a burt of activity in a short duration and the corresponding
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) in Fig 2(bottom) for the time series
recorded at Santa Tacia station. In this ﬁgure(Fig 2[bottom]) the maximum
correlation is shown by white color (which indicates maximum correlation),
which occurs between 15 to 25 seconds approximately shown in ﬁg 2. CWT of

stations according to their distance from the epicentral distance of the earthquake.

Epicentral Distances(Km)

Fig. 5. From this ﬁgure it is clear that the fractal dimension of singularity support
is around 1 (− ∗ −), lower bound and upper bound of singularity increases with
the epicentral distances(−0−,−2− and respectively) , and half-width has not such
incremental behavior(−∇−).

the recorded data also shows that pseudo frequencies of the major events are
less than 2 Hz. For Santa Tacia data it is few hundred mHz to 2 Hz. From the
same ﬁgure(Fig 2[bottom]) it is also clear that the high frequencies i.e. 1-2
Hz come in very short range (1-4 seconds), and mHz frequencies comes with
relatively longer durations (about 10 seconds). Multifractal analysis of the
earthquake data recorded at diﬀerent stations of increasing distances from
the El Salvador earthquake epicenter of 2001 has been carried out. In the
table 1 the ﬁrst column represents the station according to their distance
from the earthquake epicenter (distances shown in the second column is in
km). In order to get the multifractal spectrum we ﬁrst calculated the WTMM
tree shown in the ﬁgure 3 as described in subsection 2.3. Using Legendre
transform method we have obtained the multifractal spectrum shown in the
ﬁgure 4. From multifractal analysis it is clear that the fractal dimension of
the singularity support is around one. Lower bound and upper bound of the
singularity increases with the distances of the station from the earthquake

epicenter shown in table 1 and in ﬁgure 4. It indicates the signal becomes
smoother with distance, but the half width of the singularity support has
random variation with distances.

In conclusion, the data shows a multifractal behavior, and the major event

takes place in a short duration.

Some of the MATLAB function of Wavelab has been used in this analysis(

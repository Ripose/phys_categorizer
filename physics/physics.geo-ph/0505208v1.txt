Constant-pressure constant-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at high tem-
peratures have been used to study MgSiO3 liquid, the major constituent of the Earth’s lower mantle
to conditions of the Earth’s core-mantle boundary (CMB). We have performed variable-cell ab initio
molecular dynamic simulations at relevant thermodynamic conditions across one of the measured
melting curves. The calculated equilibrium volumes and densities are compared with the simulations
using an orthorhombic perovskite conﬁguration under the same conditions. For molten MgSiO3,
we have determined the diﬀusion coeﬃcients and shear viscosities at diﬀerent thermodynamic con-
ditions. Our results provide new constraints on the properties of molten MgSiO3 at conditions
near the core-mantle boundary. The volume change on fusion is positive throughout the pressure-
temperature conditions examined and ranges from 5% at 88 GPa and 3500 K to 2.9% at 120 GPa
and 5000 K. Nevertheless, neutral or negatively buoyant melts from (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite com-
positions at deep lower mantle conditions are consistent with existing experimental constraints on
solid-liquid partition coeﬃcients for Fe. Our simulations indicate that MgSiO3 is liquid at 120 GPa
and 4500 K, consistent with the lower range of experimental melting curves for this material. Linear
extrapolation of our results indicates that the densities of liquid and solid perovskite MgSiO3 will
become equal near 180 GPa.

INTRODUCTION

Melting is a ubiquitous process in planetary interiors
and one of the dominant mechanisms for thermal trans-
port and chemical diﬀerentiation in planets. The prop-
erties of silicate liquids are thus essential for understand-
ing a wide range of geophysical phenomena related to the
deep Earth and its origin and evolution. (Mg, Fe)SiO3
perovskite is the most abundant mineral in the Earth’s
deep mantle. Here we report the ﬁrst ab initio simu-
lation of the properties of liquid MgSiO3 at conditions
corresponding to the deep interior of the Earth.

There are a number of lines of evidence that strongly
indicate the Earth (and other terrestrial planets) were
partially or wholly molten at least at certain intervals
during the accretion process [1, 2]. The subsequent cool-
ing and crystallization of a magma ocean may lead to
chemical diﬀerentiation of the mantle [3]. Thus, under-
standing the dynamics of a terrestrial magma ocean is
essential to understanding the initial conditions for the
thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth. The liq-
uid viscosity and its depth dependence are among the
important parameters that characterize an early (liquid-
rich) magma ocean [2] and melt/crystal density inver-
sions could greatly modify the structure and cooling his-
tory of such an ocean [2]. At present, only low-pressure
experimental data or calculations based on empirical po-
tentials [4] have been used to constrain these models.

The existence of small degrees (< 1%) of partial melt

in the present lower mantle has been suggested as an
explanation for the strong relative variations of shear ve-
locity relative to compressional (∂ ln VS/∂ ln VP ) velocity
in the deep mantle [5]. In the D” region at the base of
the mantle, a seismic ultra-low velocity zone (ULVZ) of
thickness 5-40 km has been detected locally on top of
the core-mantle boundary [6, 7, 8]. These regions are
characterized by seismic compressional and shear veloc-
ity reductions of ∼ 10% and ∼ 30% respectively. The
presence of relatively large degrees of partial melt (∼ 5-
30%) has been proposed as the most plausible explana-
tion for these features [9]. There is also evidence locally
for smaller shear velocity reductions in D” plausibly con-
sistent with lesser amounts of partial melt at depths as
great as 300 km above the core mantle boundary [10].

The presence of melt in the deep mantle can greatly
aﬀect a number of physical properties of the region. The
viscosity of the melt may strongly modify heat transport
and convective circulation within the boundary layer [9].
The presence of a partially molten layer suggests the den-
sity contrast between solid and melt should be small. The
buoyancy of the melt will be controlled by the intrinsic
density diﬀerence, as well as compositional diﬀerences
(i.e., Fe enrichment) between the melt and solid. Density
inversions between silicate melts and equilibrium liquidus
crystals have been extensively studied at upper mantle
conditions [11, 12]. However, there are only limited con-
straints on possible density inversions under conditions
of the Earth’s lower mantle. Recently, it has been pro-

posed based on laboratory measurements to 15 GPa that
basaltic melts may become denser than mantle peridotite
at conditions near the base of the mantle [13]. However,
these results are subject to considerable uncertainty due
to the long extrapolations involved. More direct determi-
nation of physical properties of the components of deep
mantle melts are needed.

Recent developments in the atomistic simulation of
solids and liquids based on the full solution of the quan-
tum mechanical equations for the electrons allow the
theoretical study from ﬁrst principles, i.e. without em-
pirical or adjustable parameters, of the structural, ther-
mal, and elastic properties of minerals at arbitrary con-
ditions of pressure and temperature. Recent works have
addressed successfully the thermoelastic properties of
solid MgSiO3 perovskite at Earth’s mantle conditions
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Here we focus on the properties
of liquid MgSiO3 at high pressures, which we study us-
ing ﬁrst-principles molecular dynamics at constant pres-
sure. We determine liquid densities and compare them
with solid perovskite densities at similar conditions to
extract melting properties. We also calculate or estimate
dynamical properties of liquid MgSiO3 such as diﬀusion
and viscosity.

2. TECHNICAL DETAILS

Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations [19] are per-
formed using density functional theory [20, 21] within the
generalized gradient approximation [22] (GGA). We use
ultrasoft pseudopotential [23] for O and norm-conserving
pseudopotentials [24] for Mg and Si. Nonlinear core cor-
rections [25] were used for Mg. Kohn-Sham orbitals were
expanded in plane waves with a kinetic energy cut oﬀ
of 30 Ry. The simulation cell contained 80 atoms (16
MgSiO3 units) and a time step of 13 a.t.u. was used.
Variable-cell dynamics were used to impose the required
value of the pressure [26]. Temperature was controlled
by a Nos´e thermostat [27, 28]. The liquid conﬁguration
was obtained by heating the system to 10000 K and then
decreasing the temperature to 5000 K in a total time of
1 ps.

The diﬀusivity, or diﬀusion coeﬃcient (D) is estimated
by calculating the mean square displacement of the atoms
as a function of time. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient is given
by the Einstein relation [29]:

D ≈ lim
t→∞

h|r(t0 + t) − r(t0)|2i = lim
t→∞

hδR2(t)i. (1)

The calculated mean square displacement were ﬁtted by
a straight line: hδR2(t)i ≈ 6Dt + b. The viscosity (η)
is estimated using the generalized Debye-Stokes-Einstein
formula derived by Zwanzig [30]:

Dη

kBT n1/3 = 0.0658(2 + η/ηl) = Cl.

The constant Cl depends on the ratio of the shear vis-
cosity (η) to the longitudinal viscosity (ηl). Although
these numbers are not actually available, Cl has bounds
that can vary between 0.132 and 0.181. In our work, we
adopt a typical value of Cl = 0.171. Wasserman et al [4]
studied the transport properties of perovskite melts by
molecular dynamics under temperatures (3500-6000 K)
and pressures (5.1-78 GPa) and their results agreed rea-
sonably well with Zwanzig’s formula. The general va-
lidity of Zwanzig’s formula has been studied in detail in
other systems [31, 32, 33].

3. SIMULATION RESULTS

3.1. Materials properties at high pressures and
temperatures

The calculated equilibrium volumes and densities of
four MgSiO3 units at 3500 K as a function of pressure are
given in Table I. The results are shown in the right panels
of Fig. 1. Our results at 88 GPa with the liquid conﬁgura-
tion showed that atoms are diﬀusive with a diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient of 1.14 × 10−5 cm2/s. Even though this thermody-
namic point (3500 K and 88 GPa) is close to the melting
line obtained by the Berkeley group [34, 35, 36], the sta-
bility of the liquid in our simulations does not allow us
to conclude that 3500 K is above the melting line of the
theoretical model employed. Liquid (meta)stability in
the few picoseconds of a ﬁrst-principles simulation could
be due to super-cooling eﬀects [29]. We did not estimate
the diﬀusion coeﬃcients at higher pressures because all
the available melting curves suggest that MgSiO3 can
only be solid at these thermodynamic conditions.

Regarding the simulations with liquid conﬁguration,
when pressure increases, the atoms approach each other
and become no longer diﬀusive. This can be observed by
our estimated diﬀusion coeﬃcients at 88 GPa (1.14×10−5
cm2/s) and 120 GPa (0.04×10−5 cm2/s). In other words,
the under-cooled liquid is glassiﬁed. This agrees with the
melting curve obtained from Knittle and Jeanloz [35],

In addition, as pressure

increases, the percentage diﬀerence of volumes between
solid and liquid MgSiO3 becomes smaller, which indicate
a tendency of density inversion at higher pressures. In
the left panels of Fig. 1, the volumes and densities are
shown as a function of temperature up to 5000 K. Pres-
sure is ﬁxed at 120 GPa. This is close to that at the
top of the D” region in the mantle. This pressure is also
close to where MgSiO3 transforms to a post-perovskite
phase [37] In this study, our solid state calculations are
restricted to the perovskite crystal structure. The volume
of the post-perovskite (CaIrO3-type) phase is ∼1-1.5%
less than perovskite [38, 39, 40] at deep lower mantle
pressures, so this transformation will increase the density
contrast between solid and liquid. Because of uncertain-
ties associated with the Clapeyron slope of the transition
and the deep mantle geotherm, it is possible that at the
base of the mantle the geotherm will cross back into the
perovskite stability ﬁeld [41].

Although melting has not been observed during the
simulations, our results provide an upper bound of the
solid volume. The numerical results are given in Table II.
For liquid simulations, the changes of volume and density
can be approximately divided into two regions, say, T >
4500 K and T < 4000 K. It may be due to the possible
glassiﬁcation of liquid below 4000 K. Similar observation
of glassiﬁcation can be found if one looks at the mean
square displacements of the liquid at diﬀerent tempera-
tures.

3.2. Diﬀusion near the core-mantle boundary

In Table II, we tabulate the equilibrium volumes and
densities of solid and molten MgSiO3, together with
the estimated diﬀusion coeﬃcients and viscosities of the
molten MgSiO3 as a function of temperature. Pressure is
ﬁxed at 120 GPa. The volumes and densities are shown
in the left panels of Fig. 1. The estimated diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient drops drastically as the temperature drops from
4500 K to 4000 K. This is a strong indication of glassiﬁca-
tion of molten MgSiO3. The mean square displacements
of molten MgSiO3 at diﬀerent temperatures are shown in
Fig. 2. At higher temperatures (4500 K ∼ 5000 K), The
atoms are clearly diﬀusive. This provides strong evidence
that molten MgSiO3 exists at 4500 K and 120 GPa.

The mean square displacements of diﬀerent species of
atoms are shown in Fig. 3. Both solid and liquid results
are shown.
In the solid, Si atoms are bounded by the
octahedra formed by the O atoms, and each octahedron

is then surrounded by 8 Mg atoms. Hence Mg atoms are
expected to have a larger vibrational amplitude then that
of the other species, and Si atoms are expected to have
the smallest vibrational amplitude (Fig. 3).
In molten
MgSiO3, the slopes of the mean square displacements of
each species is close to that of each other. This suggests
the self-diﬀusion rate of each species is almost the same.
The simplest explanation is that the three types of atoms
diﬀuse like a single molecule, which has to be examined
carefully. However, as the diﬀusion mechanism is beyond
the scope of this work, it will be the subject of further
studies.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

At 3500 K, the density of crystalline MgSiO3 in the
perovskite structure is 5% greater than the liquid at 88
GPa, and this density excess is 2.9% at 120 GPa and 5000
K. The transformation to a post-perovskite phase would
further enhance this density contrast. Thus, we ﬁnd that
liquid MgSiO3 is always less dense than the correspond-
ing solid under conditions encountered in Earth’ s man-
tle. This implies that stability of melts in the deep lower
mantle requires in addition compositional diﬀerences be-
tween melt and solid. It is well known on the basis of
mineral-melt partitioning data for perovskite that Fe is
preferentially partitioned into the melt. Hence, in addi-
tion to the volume of fusion, Fe enrichment in the melt
must be considered when evaluating the stability of melts
in an idealized (Mg,Fe)SiO3 lower mantle [42].

The eﬀect of Fe on densities in crystalline and liquid
(Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskites can be calculated using known
thermoelastic parameters [43, 44] and assuming the ef-
fect of Fe on density in the liquid is similar to its ef-
fect on the solid. For solid (Mg,Fe)SiO3 compositions
with Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios of 0.90 to 0.95, the solid-liquid
Fe partition coeﬃcients required to be in equilibrium
with neutrally buoyant melt at 120 GPa and 5000 K
range from 0.31 to 0.48. These are within the wide
range of reported experimental partition coeﬃcients for
perovskite compositions at lower mantle pressures (0.12-
0.57) [42, 45, 46]. Thus, the combination of the small,
positive volume change of fusion determined here with
Fe partitioning constraints from experiment suggest that
negative or neutrally buoyant melts are plausible in the
D” and ULVZ layers at least with respect to perovskite

structure solids. Partition coeﬃcients within the exper-
imentally measured range (0.2-0.34) also produce neu-
trally buoyant melts at 88 GPa and 3500 K. Thus, these
results suggest that small amounts of neutrally buoy-
ant partial melt in the deep lower mantle could also
contribute to the anomalous ∂ ln VS/∂ ln VP observed in
this region [5]. Negative buoyancy under these condi-
tions could instead lead to melt pooling in D” and the
ULVZ [42]. Better constraints on Fe partition coeﬃcients
under deep mantle conditions are needed to distinguish
between these possibilities.

Extrapolation of the trend in Fig. 1 indicates that
MgSiO3 liquid and crystal densities will become equal
near 180 GPa. There are few experimental constraints
on densities in MgSiO3 liquids under these extreme con-
ditions. The density change along the Hugoniot in
Mg2SiO4 upon shock melting at 150 GPa is small and
there is a suggestion of enhanced compressibility in the
melt [47]. More recent shock experiments on MgSiO3
compositions have suggested that the density of the melt
becomes comparable to that of the solid near 120 GPa,
and at 170 GPa the melt density exceeds the solid den-
sity [48]. However, the shock data near 120 GPa (which
are directly comparable to our simulations) have uncer-
tainties that allow melt densities to be as much as several
percent less than the solid, and thus they are not neces-
sarily inconsistent with the present results.

The viscosities of silicate liquids have been investigated
experimentally using a wide variety of techniques at am-
bient and low pressures [49]. However, there are few
constraints on the behavior of silica poor and relatively
depolymerized melts that are relevant to melting in the
deep Earth. The viscosity of a diopside (CaMgSi2O6) liq-
uid has recently been determined to high pressures and
temperatures using the falling sphere method [50]. At 8-
13 GPa and 2200-2470 K, the reported viscosities range
from 28-510 centipoise which are generally larger than
our higher pressure and temperature values (Table II).
The temperature dependence of viscosity for MgSiO3 liq-
uid remains strong even at 120 GPa (Table II).

In this work, we preformed ab initio molecular dy-
namic simulations to study MgSiO3, the main mineral
composition in the Earth’s lower mantle. By applying
variable-cell dynamics, we studied both solid perovskite
and molten MgSiO3 in constant N P T ensemble without
the need for optimizing the cell parameters. At ther-
modynamic conditions close to that of the core-mantle

boundary, we have constrained the viscosity, diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient, and density of liquid MgSiOi3. Our results also
support the validity of the relatively low melting curve
for MgSiO3 perovskite [34, 35, 36] as compared with that
reported by Zerr and Boehler [51].

The next step is to study the diﬀusion mechanism in
molten MgSiO3 as well as the chemical heterogeneity on
the diﬀusion and melting behavior. With the increasing
computation power, it is anticipated that the applica-
tions of ab initio molecular dynamics can contribute to

detailed understanding of mineral physics at the core-
mantle boundary.

Abstract

We report the direct observation of a peculiar lava channel that was formed near the base of

a parasitic cone during the 2001 eruption on Mount Etna. Erosive processes by ﬂowing lava are

commonly attributed to thermal erosion. However, ﬁeld evidence strongly suggests that models of

thermal erosion cannot explain the formation of this channel. Here, we put forward the idea that

the essential erosion mechanism was abrasive wear. By applying a simple model from tribology

we demonstrate that the available data agree favorably with our hypothesis. Consequently, we

propose that erosional processes resembling the wear phenomena in glacial erosion are possible in

a volcanic environment.

Introduction – Formation of lava channels is usually discussed in terms of thermal or

thermomechanical erosion [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The basic idea is that heat is transferred from

the hot ﬂowing lava to the cold substrate, thereby melting it and washing it out. Thermal

erosion by lava has been studied quantitatively both for turbulent [1, 3, 4, 5] and for laminar

ﬂows [2, 6, 7]. The physics underlying the quantitative description is that of heat transport in

liquids and solids combined with ﬂuid dynamics. The idea of thermal erosion in the formation

of lava channels is supported by ﬁeld evidence only in few examples [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], e.g.,

in archaean komatiite lavas [8], in African carbonatites [9, 10], or in basaltic lava tubes of

Kilauea volcano (Hawaii) [11].

In the picture of thermal erosion, the relevance of mechanical processes appears to be

secondary being mainly limited to the removal of the melted material. However, it has been

noted that mechanical eﬀects may enhance the erosion rates [6, 12]. Very recently, Williams

et al. have reported geochemical evidence for mechanical erosion in the Cave Basalt of

Mount St. Helens where a basaltic ﬂow eroded an unconsolidated pyroclastic substrate [13].

To our knowledge, this is the only example in the literature in which a dominant role of

mechanical erosion of lava has been inferred (aspects of models for mechanical erosion have

been considered theoretically before [14]). Therefore, the direct observation of the formation

of a lava channel whose origin cannot be explained by thermal erosion is of considerable

interest. Such an observation may help to develop new and more complete models for the

explanation of the ﬁeld data elsewhere. Moreover, it generates interesting cross-links to

other branches of geology where a variety of erosion models are discussed.

The starting point of this work was the formation of an uncommon channel during the

2001 eruption on Mount Etna which provides ﬁeld evidence for purely mechanical erosion

of lava ﬂow. First, we brieﬂy describe the morphological details of the channel and the

history of the eruption (see also Ref. [15]). An estimate of the heat transfer required for the

formation of the channel basically rules out thermal erosion as the essential process. Then,

we will discuss the possibility of erosion due to abrasive wear and demonstrate that this

hypothesis may account also quantitatively for the ﬁeld observations. We will conclude the

discussion of our model by deriving some theoretical predictions and compare them to those

for thermal erosion.

Description of the Laghetto channel – The channel, informally named Laghetto, is located

on the upper southern ﬂank of Mount Etna volcano at an elevation of 2560 m a.s.l. (see Fig.

2

1). It is roughly linear, of rectangular-shaped cross section and is incised on a lava slope
gently inclined (5◦–10◦). Its axis is oriented E-W. It is 220 m long and has a width between

8 and 16 m. Maximum depth is 6 m, the ﬂoor of the channel is covered by lava. The banks

consist of lava ﬂows emitted between July 25th and 30th. They are formed of up to 11 thin
lava layers, each about 0.2 to 0.3 m thick (cf. Fig. 2). The eroded volume is about 220 m ×
12 m × 4 m ≈ 10,000 m3. Note that this volume is underestimated since part of the channel

is ﬁlled with the eroding lava.

Description of the eruptive event – The eruption started on July 19th forming a crater in

the area of Piano del Lago. In the ﬁrst week, the eruption (closely observed by the authors)

gave rise only to phreatomagmatic explosions and lava fountains. From July 25th for the

5 following days lava was erupted from the vent. The relatively low lava output (probably

< 5 m3/s) was not constant but intermittent thus originating a number of thin and short

(average length < 500 m) lava ﬂows.

In the evening of July 30th we witnessed an abrupt change in the lava output. A huge

lava ﬂow (10 to 20 m high) was emitted. The lava ﬂowed (in laminar motion) for about 12

hours reaching the area of Rifugio Sapienza, 2000 m down valley. Near the vent the lava

ﬂowed on a bedrock formed by the still hot and soft thin lava layers of the preceding days.

In these hours the bedrock was eroded and the following morning the Laghetto channel was

there. After this last ﬂow, lava emission at the Laghetto vent ceased. Therefore, the channel

was not buried under subsequent lavas. It is this fortunate circumstance that allowed us to

study the phenomenon and measure the channel before it was partially covered by sand and

ash fall of the ﬂank eruption of October 2002.

Thermal erosion hypothesis – Let us assume that the channel was thermally eroded. This
implies that the lava ﬂow had to supply (at least) the energy ∆E to melt the material
originally contained in the channel, i.e., the volume Wv ≈ 104 m3

∆E = ρ Wv · ( L + c(Tm − Tsubst)) .

(1)

Here c = 1.4 · 103 J/(kg K) is the speciﬁc heat of the lava substrate (calculated for the
speciﬁc lava composition using MELTS [16]), Tm ≈ 1050◦C is a lower limit for the onset of
melting, and Tsubst ∼ 900◦C denotes the likely substrate temperature. With a lava density of
ρ = 2800 kg/m3 and a latent heat of L = 0.5 · 5.0 · 105 J/kg for an assumed 50% cristallinity
(using typical values for basaltic lavas [6, 7, 13]), about 1.3 × 1013 Joule were required.

3

The eroding lava ﬂow had a total length s ≈ 2000 m (the distance between vent and
the Rifugio Sapienza area) and an average height hﬂ ∼ 10 m. Typically, Mount Etna lavas

are rich in phenocrysts (i.e., they are erupted partially solidiﬁed) and their temperature
(Tl ∼ 1050 − 1100◦C) is close to the solidus point.

Assuming an excessive temperature diﬀerence Tl − Tm ∼ 50 K, the lava ﬂow (approx.
240,000 m3) could provide at most 4.7 × 1013 Joule of heat energy (during 12 hours). There-

fore, a signiﬁcant part of the available heat energy had to be transferred extremely rapidly

from the lava ﬂow to the substrate to thermally erode the channel. The corresponding
heat current density (transferred energy/(time×channel surface)) amounts to ∼ 105 W/m2).
Even with a temperature gradient on the order of ∼ 100 K/m this corresponds to a heat
conductivity of about ∼ 103 W/(m·K).

This is rather unrealistic as can be seen by the following considerations. First, the huge

heat transfer rate would have required a heat conductivity exceeding by far that of noble
metals (e.g., for silver one has κAg ≈ 4 × 102 W/(m·K) [17] while basaltic lavas have κ ∼ 1
W/(m·K) [6, 7]). Second, the noticeable heat loss would have increased viscosity leading to

rapid deceleration and eventual standstill of the ﬂow. This is in contradiction with the ﬁeld

observations. Finally, we have neglected heat loss, e.g., radiative heat loss and the formation

of chill layers [7]. Thus, we conclude that thermal erosion cannot have played a dominant

role in the channel formation.

Mechanical erosion hypothesis – Friction and wear are ubiquitous phenomena in every-

day life. Their investigation in physics and engineering sciences, however, is a relatively

young ﬁeld [18, 19]. Mechanical erosion is one of the fundamental processes in geology,

quantitatively studied, e.g., in the context of bedrock [20] and glacial [21] erosion. While

such studies focus on the dynamics, based on ﬁeld data for many examples, the aim of the

present discussion is merely to argue that the formation of the Laghetto channel does comply

with the fundamental concepts of abrasive wear.

The idea of purely mechanical erosion is imposed by the fact that strata in the channel

banks are clearly distinguished (cf. Fig 2), indicating that the material was removed by

“cutting” rather than by melting. The question is which mechanisms have acted and how

they can be described quantitatively.

We propose the following intuitive picture. The erosive lava was a thick (up to 20 m)

autoclastic ﬂow, i.e., a dense mixture of crystals and clasts, metric in size, suspended in a

4

melt matrix. The mesh of clasts got dragged along the bed such that the irregular clast

surfaces in contact with the bed could plough out grooves. These are the characteristics of

abrasive and erosive wear processes [22].

It needs to be emphasized that abrasion and wear are rather complex phenomena and

therefore hard to model at a ‘microscopic’ level (that is, by identifying a dominant mech-

anism and deducing, e.g., wear rates from dynamical equations and material properties, in

particular if the process parameters cannot be deﬁned as well as in systematic lab exper-

iments). For this reason, phenomenological models that are well-established by empirical

studies and describe whole classes of wear processes are of considerable importance. One

of the simplest quantitative models to describe wear phenomena is Archard’s law [18]. It

establishes a phenomenological relation between the wear volume Wv, the normal load F ,

and the sliding distance s:

Wv
s

= k · F
H

.

(2)

Here, H denotes the hardness of the worn material proportional to the yield strength τ
(H ≈ 3τ ). Further, k is the wear coeﬃcient, i.e., a dimensionless constant which depends on

the wear mechanism. Abrasive wear by sliding glaciers is described by similar models [21].

From the observations we can estimate Wv, s, F , and H. For a realistic model, k should be
0.1 or smaller. The wear volume is Wv ≈ 10, 000 m3. The sliding distance is the total length
of the ﬂow (s ≈ 2000 m) and the load F is the weight of the abrading lava along the length
of the channel. With an average height of the ﬂow of 10 m we ﬁnd F ≈ 26, 000 m3 × 2800
kg/m3 × 9.8 m/s2 ≈ 7.3 × 108 N.

It is more diﬃcult to estimate the hardness H of the substrate since its yield strength is

an exponential function of temperature. Note that these lava layers had been erupted only

days or hours before. Their outer skin was black, but they were still incandescent inside.
For cold lavas yield strength values are ∼ 107 Pa. According to Ref. [23] for a temperature
of 1000 ◦C yield strength is larger than 104 Pa. For a likely temperature of 900 ◦C we
interpolate values between 105 to 106 Pa.

By inserting these numbers into Eq. (2) we obtain k ≈ 10−3 . . . 10−2. This wear coeﬃcient
lies well within the typical range for abrasive and erosive wear processes (k ∼ 10−5 . . . 10−1)

measured in tribology [22], conﬁrming the intuitive picture for the erosive action of the lava

ﬂow.

Note that our estimate of k and its relation to the wear mechanism is rather robust

5

against variations due to uncertainties in the observations while thermal erosion remains

excluded by several orders of magnitude.

In view of the strong support that the experimental observations provide for the idea of

mechanical erosion, we may invert the argument: we may ask what theoretical predictions

can be obtained from assuming this kind of erosive mechanism, and compare them with

the results for thermal erosion. To this end, we rewrite Archard’s law Eq. (2) in terms

of characteristic quantities of the erosive process. We have already mentioned the sliding

distance s, the height of the ﬂow hﬂ, the density of the lava ρ, the hardness H of the substrate,

and the constant k which characterizes the wear mechanism. Further we introduce the width

wﬂ of the ﬂow (the latter is equal to the channel width wch), the depth dch and the length

lch of the channel. With Wv = lchwchdch and F = ρglchwﬂhﬂ cos α (where α is the angle of
the slope; for simplicity we will approximate cos α ≈ 1 for moderate slopes) we obtain the

relation

This equation can be further transformed by assuming that the ﬂow rate per unit width Q

was constant for the duration tﬂ of the ﬂow. The result is

where Vmech denotes the velocity of mechanical erosion Vmech = d

dtﬂ dch. This relation can be

compared to Kerr’s key result for the melting velocity Vthermal due to laminar ﬂows [7]

dch =

here U denotes the surface velocity of the ﬂow, and we have identiﬁed dch ≡ hﬂ for thermal

erosion. While Eq. (5) implies, e.g., [7]

Vthermal ∝ Q1/9

,

hﬂ,thermal ∝ Q1/3

our simple theory of mechanical erosion predicts

Vmech ∝ Q ∝ hﬂ,mech .

Moreover, the substrate yield strength depends exponentially on the substrate temperature:
H = a exp (−bTsubst) (with material constants a, b > 0) and thus determines the temperature

dependence of the ratio Vmech/Q in Eq. (4) while for thermal erosion the ratio Vthermal/Q1/3

depends on Tsubst via a rational function (the Stefan number, cf. Ref. [7]).

Thus, our hypothesis leads to concrete predictions which are substantially diﬀerent from

those for thermal erosion, even without precise knowledge regarding the ‘microscopic details’

of the erosion mechanism. An important consequence of Eqs. (6) and (7) is that, with

increasing ﬂow rate Q, the velocity of mechanical erosion Vmech grows much faster than that

of thermal erosion. That is, for typical parameters of basaltic lava ﬂows [7, 23] one may

obtain velocities of mechanical erosion that are one or two orders of magnitude larger than

those for thermal erosion due to laminar ﬂows with the same ﬂow rate. This fact may help to

explain the observation of lava-channel formation even in the absence of very high eruption

temperatures and long-lived, low-viscosity ﬂows (cf. Ref. [13]).

Conclusions – The analysis presented here focused mainly on explaining the physical

processes at the origin of the Laghetto channel. It may serve as a basic approach to me-

chanical erosion by lava ﬂows. Further ﬁeld studies and a better understanding of the erosive

processes at the ’microscopic level’ will help to reﬁne the model. It is important to note

that the observation of the channel formation described here represents a singular event.

Nevertheless, similar features indicating mechanical erosion can be found in historical and

prehistorical lava ﬁelds on Mount Etna and elsewhere [13]. Finally we mention that new

aspects in channel formation processes on Earth may provide useful hints also for the as-

sessment of erosion mechanisms in planetary environments such as lunar sinuous rilles and

venusian canali [1, 3, 6].

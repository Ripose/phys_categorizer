Abstract.

We study how a stress perturbation generated by a mainshock aﬀects a population
of faults obeying a rate-state friction law. Depending on the model parameters and on
the initial state, the fault exhibits aftershocks, slow earthquakes, or decaying afterslip.
We found several regimes with slip rate decaying as a power-law of time, with diﬀerent
characteristic times and exponents. The complexity of the model makes it unrealistic to
invert for the friction law parameters from afterslip data. We modeled afterslip measure-
ments for the Southern California Superstition Hills earthquake using the complete rate-
and-state law, and found a huge variety of model parameters that can ﬁt the observed
data. In particular, it is impossible to distinguish the stable velocity strengthening regime
(A > B) from the (potentially) unstable velocity weakening regime (B > A and stiﬀ-
ness k < kc). Therefore, it is not necessary to involve small scale spatial or temporal
ﬂuctuations of friction parameters A or B in order to explain the transition between sta-
ble sliding and seismic slip. In addition to B/A and stiﬀness k/kc, the fault behavior is
strongly controlled by stress levels following an event. Stress heterogeneity can thus ex-
plain most of the variety of postseismic behavior observed in nature. Afterslip will in-
duce a progressive reloading of faults that are not slipping, which can trigger aftershocks.
Using the relation between stress and seismicity derived from the rate-and-state friction
law, we estimate the aftershock rate triggered by afterslip. Aftershock rate does not sim-
ply scale with stress rate, but exhibits diﬀerent characteristic times and sometimes a dif-
ferent power-law exponent. Afterslip is thus a possible candidate to explain observations
of aftershock rate decaying as a power-law of time with an Omori exponent that can be
either smaller or larger than 1.

1. Introduction

Most shallow large earthquakes are followed by a signiﬁ-
cant postseismic deformation, and by an increase in seismic
activity, which both start immediately after the mainshock
and last for several years. The link between aseismic af-
terslip and aftershock activity is however not clear. The
cumulative moment released by aftershocks is usually much
lower than the one associated with afterslip, which implies
that postseismic deformation is unlikely to be due to after-
shock activity. The similar time decay and duration of post-
seismic deformation and aftershocks rather suggests that af-
tershocks are induced by afterslip [Wennerberg and Sharp,
1997; Schaﬀ et al., 1998; Perfettini and Avouac, 2004; Hsu
et al., 2006]. But there are alternative models which explain
aftershock triggering by the static [Dieterich, 1994] or dy-
namic [Gomberg et al., 1998] stress change associated with
the mainshock, or by ﬂuid ﬂow [Nur and Booker , 1972].

Postseismic deformation is most often localized around
the rupture zone, and is thus modeled as afterslip on the
mainshock fault. However, there are observations of long-
range diﬀuse deformation following large earthquakes [Nur
and Mavko, 1972], which can be modeled by visco-eslatic
relaxation of the lower crust or upper mantle. Another po-
tential candidate for postseimic deformation is poro-elastic
deformation. Distinguishing between the diﬀerent mecha-
nisms is diﬃcult based on available data [Mont´esi, 2004].
In some cases, several processes have to be involved to ﬁt

the data [Pollitz et al., 2006; Freed et al., 2006]. Afterslip
is often comparable with postseismic slip (see [Pritchard
and Simons, 2006] for a review on afterslip in subduction
zones), even if there are very large variations in the amount
of afterslip from one event to another one [Melbourne et al.,
2002; Marone, 1998; Pritchard and Simons, 2006]. For in-
stance, the mw7.6 1994 Sanriku-Haruka-Oki earthquake in
Japan had very large afterslip, with cumulative seismic mo-
ment a little larger than the coseismic moment [Heki et al.,
1997]. Takai et al. [1999] also reported afterslip as large, in
term of seismic moment, as coseismic slip for a much smaller
mw = 5.7 earthquake in the same area. This suggest that
afterslip scales with coseismic slip.

The rate-and-state friction law, introduced by Dieterich
[1979] based on laboratory friction experiments, has been
frequently used to model both aseismic deformation [e.g.,
Marone et al., 1991], slow earthquakes [e.g., Yoshida and
Kato, 2003], and seismic activity [e.g., Dieterich, 1994]. De-
pending on the parameters of the rate-and-state friction law,
the model is either stable (aseismic slip), or produce slip in-
stabilities (earthquakes). In the unstable regime, the rate-
and-state friction law provides a relation between stress his-
tory and seismicity [Dieterich, 1994]. This relation can be
used to predict the seismicity rate triggered by any stress
change, such as static [Dieterich, 1994] or dynamic [Gomberg
et al., 1998] stress change induced by a mainshock, postseis-
mic slip, or transient deformation associated with intrusions
or eruptions [Dieterich et al., 2000], slow earthquakes [Segall
et al., 2006] or tides [Cochran et al., 2004]. Extensions of
the original theory to include stress heterogeneity as a fun-
damental aspect of aftershock process has further improved
matches with observations, including where aftershocks oc-
cur and modiﬁcations to the time dependence of the decay

[Marsan, 2006; Helmstetter and Shaw , 2006]. This exten-
sion explains why many aftershocks occur on the mainshock
rupture area, where stress decreases on average after the
mainshock.

Previous studies have modeled afterslip using the rate-
and-state friction law [Scholz , 1990; Marone et al., 1991;
Marone, 1998; Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997; Schaﬀ et al.,
1998; Miyazaki et al., 2004; Mont´esi, 2004], or a simpler
rate-dependent friction law [Perfettini and Avouac, 2004;
Hsu et al., 2006]. These studies have assumed that afterslip
is associated with stable faults in the velocity strengthen-
ing regime. They have also assumed that faults are close
to the steady state regime during afterslip, which amounts
to neglect of fault healing. With this approximation, the
friction coeﬃcient only depends on slip velocity, which sim-
pliﬁes the analysis. These studies have been very successful
in matching afterslip data [Scholz , 1990; Marone et al., 1991;
Marone, 1998; Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997; Miyazaki et al.,
2004; Mont´esi, 2004]. However, they also bring new prob-
lems. The observation that afterslip and earthquakes often
occur on the same parts of a fault requires either small-scale
spatial [Miyazaki et al., 2004] or temporal [Wennerberg and
Sharp, 1997] variations in the friction parameters.

In this work, we study analytically and numerically the
postseismic slip in the rate-and-state model, without using
the steady state approximation. We show that afterslip is
not limited to stable faults, but can also occur in seismo-
genic zones. We also ﬁt the model to the afterslip data
measured following the 1987 Superstition Hills earthquake
and analysed by Wennerberg and Sharp [1997].

Afterslip transfers stress from sliding to locked part of
the fault, and is thus a potential mechanism for aftershock
triggering [Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997; Schaﬀ et al., 1998;
Perfettini and Avouac, 2004; Hsu et al., 2006]. Dieterich
[1994] noted that non-constant stressing following an earth-
quake can alter the aftershock decay rate, and give rise to
Omori exponents larger than 1. The suggestion that af-
terslip triggers aftershocks is based on the observation that
both afterslip and aftershock rate roughly decay as the in-
verse of the time since the mainshock. However, there is
a priori no reason to expect that aftershock rate is propor-
tional to stress rate.
In particular, in the rate-and-state
friction model, earthquakes can be triggered at very long
times following a stress change. The relation between stress
history and seismicity rate is indeed complex and non-linear
[Dieterich, 1994]. We thus use the complete rate-and-state
friction law in order to model afterslip and aftershock activ-
ity. This allow us to better explain the temporal and spatial
distribution of afterslip and aftershocks.

2. Rate-and-state friction law and afterslip

2.1. Slider-block model with rate-and-state friction

We use the rate and state friction formulation of Ruina

[1983], based on [Dieterich, 1979]

µ = µ∗ + A ln

V
V ∗ + B ln

θV ∗
Dc

.

where µ∗ and V ∗ are constants, A and B are friction pa-
rameters, Dc is the critical slip distance, and θ is the state
variable, which will evolve with slip and time. The state
variable is often interpreted as the average age of contacts
on the fault.

There are a couple of evolution laws for the state variable.

Dieterich [1994] used the slowness law

(1)

(2)

dθ

,

Following Dieterich [1994], we model a fault by a slider-
spring system. The friction coeﬃcient of the block is given

by

µ =

=

τ
σ

τr − kδ
σ

(3)

where k is the spring stiﬀness, σ is the normal stress, τ the
shear stress on the interface, τr is the remotely aplied stress
acting on the fault in the absence of slip, and −kδ is the
decrease in stress due to fault slip. Expression (3) neglects
inertia, and is thus only valid for low slip speed in the in-
terseismic period. The stiﬀness is a function of the crack
length l and shear modulus G [Dieterich, 1994]

k ≈ G/l .

(4)

2.2. Steady state approximation

In the steady state regime ˙θ = 0, the friction law (1)

becomes

µss(V ) = µ∗ + (A − B) ln

(5)

V
V ∗ .

If A > B, the friction law is velocity-strengthening, and the
system is stable. In this regime, the state variable relaxes
toward its steady state value when the slip exceeds the crit-
ical slip Dc, and at constant sliding velocity. If A < B, the
steady state (5) is unstable, except during inertia controlled
instabilities [Rice and Tse, 1986], and unless the system is
too stiﬀ. Ruina [1983] showed that, in order to produce
slip instabilities (”earthquakes”), we need both B > A and
k < kc, where kc is deﬁned by

kc =

σ(B − A)
Dc

.

(6)

Note that kc deﬁned by (6) is negative for A > B.

In the steady state approximation, the state variable is
constant, there is thus no healing. This approximation ˙θ = 0
in (2) also requires that the slip speed is approximately con-
stant equal to Dc/θ. Therefore, it does not seem relevant to
model afterslip, when slip speed decreases between coseis-
mic slip speed (≈ m/s) at very short times, to values lower
than the long-term rate (≈ mm/yr ≈ 10−10m/s) at large
times.

Previous studies [Scholz , 1990; Marone et al., 1991; Wen-
nerberg and Sharp, 1997; Marone, 1998; Schaﬀ et al., 1998;
Mont´esi, 2004; Hsu et al., 2006] have used the rate-and-state
friction law to model afterslip, assuming the fault is close
to the steady state regime. They suggested that afterslip is
produced within velocity-strengthening (A > B) parts of the
fault, below or above the seismogenic zone (where B > A to
produce earthquakes). In these zones, there is a slip deﬁcit
after an earthquake, and thus an increase in Coulomb stress,
which is relaxed during afterslip.

With the steady state approximation ˙θ ≈ 0, and without
loading stress rate ( ˙τr = 0), afterslip increases logarithmi-
cally with time [Scholz , 1990; Marone et al., 1991]

We can test the limit of validity of equation (7) by inject-
ing the solution for the slip speed (9) and the state variable
θ = Dc/V0 back into the evolution law (2)

˙θ = 1 −

(10)

This shows that the steady state approximation (7) works
only for very short times, when velocity is close to its initial
value, but gets very bad when t > t∗. Thus it cannot explain
the power law decay of afterslip rate with time.

Nevertheless, application of expression (7) provides a very
good ﬁt to afterslip data, with however signiﬁcant discrep-
ancies [Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997; Mont´esi, 2004]. To
better explain the data, Wennerberg and Sharp [1997] have
used a more complex form of equation (1). They have also
suggested to introduce a second state variable in (1), in order
to explain apparent negative values of A obtained when in-
verting afterslip data, and to explain the transition between
aseismic and seismic slip during the earthquake cycle.

Mont´esi [2004] introduced a non-zero loading stress in or-
der to better ﬁt GPS data. But nobody has yet checked the
consistency of the steady-state assumption and veriﬁed that
˙θ in the evolution law (2) is indeed negligible during after-
slip. Only Marone et al. [1991] performed numerical sim-
ulations without the quasi-static approximation (5), which
were in good agreement with the analytical solution (7) for
a few cases.

While most afterslip generally occurs below or above the
seismogenic zone [Marone et al., 1991; Hsu et al., 2006],
there are observations suggesting that afterslip can also oc-
cur along strike the rupture zone [Melbourne et al., 2002;
Pritchard and Simons, 2006; Chlieh et al., 2007], or even
within the rupture area [Miyazaki et al., 2004], and can
be associated with aftershocks [Miyazaki et al., 2004]. To
explain these observations within the steady state approx-
imation, we need to invoke small scale spatial or temporal
variations of the friction parameters A or B [Miyazaki et al.,
2004; Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997].

Miyazaki et al. [2004] attempted to distinguish between
velocity-weakening and velocity strengthening behavior for
diﬀerent parts of the fault that slipped after the 2003
Tokachi-oki earthquake. They inverted afterslip and stress
changes on the fault from GPS data. They found that,
within the rupture area, slip rate and stress initially decrease
with time. But then stress increases while slip velocity con-
tinues to decrease. For other parts of the fault around the
rupture area, stress decreases roughly linearly with the log of
the slip rate, as expected with the steady state approxima-
tion (5). Miyazaki et al. [2004] interpreted these results as
evidence for velocity-weakening (unstable) behavior within
the rupture area, and velocity-strengthening regime around
the mainshock rupture. However, the steady state approx-
imation (5) is only valid at constant slip speed, while slip
rate changes by several orders of magnitude in their observa-
tions. The diﬀerent behavior between the rupture area and
surrounding regions may rather arise from diﬀerent stress
histories: stress increases within the rupture area because it
is reloaded by surrounding region, where afterslip is larger.
Marone et al. [1991] also evoked the possibility that after-
slip may be produced by unstable faults, but noted that ”for
a fault that exhibits only velocity-weakening behavior, the
steady-state frictional resistance decreases with slip velocity,
eliminating the stress transient needed to drive afterslip.”
However, it is possible to produce signiﬁcant afterslip start-
ing from the steady state with B > A, and with realistic val-
ues of Dc. Rice and Tse [1986] studied a simple slider-block
model in the unstable regime including inertia, and showed
that the slider is close to steady state during inertia con-
trolled instability, when slip exceeds Dc. During dynamic
rupture, stress ﬁrst decreases as slip velocity increases, but

further increases as slip decelerates. When inertia becomes
negligible, the system escapes from the steady-state regime,
and both slip rate and stress slowly decrease with time (see
ﬁg 3a of [Rice and Tse, 1986]). Thus, even if the slider is in
the steady state regime at the end of dynamic rupture, there
can be signiﬁcant afterslip for velocity weakening faults. In
addition, earthquake rupture is more complex than with sin-
gle degree of freedom systems. There may be parts of the
fault where slip is smaller than Dc, and stress transfers dur-
ing dynamic rupture propagation can produce stress concen-
tration, so that stress can be locally larger than its steady
state value after a mainshock.

In this section, we study analytically and numerically
the complete rate-and-state friction law (1,2) both in
the velocity-strengthening and in the velocity-weakening
regimes. We then attempt to invert the friction law param-
eters by ﬁtting the afterslip data of Wennerberg and Sharp
[1997] for the 1987 Superstition Hills earthquake.

2.3. Stability condition

Depending on the parameter B/A, stiﬀness k/kc, and
stress, the system exhibits either decaying afterslip, slow
earthquakes, or slip singularity (”aftershock”). Rice and Tse
[1986] derived the condition of stability for a slider without
loading rate ( ˙τr = 0) with B > A and k < kc. They found
that the system is stable if µ < µl with

µl(V ) = µss(V ) +

= µss(V ) +

(11)

kDcB

We compute below the limit of the friction coeﬃcient
above which initial acceleration is positive. We rewrite the
rate-and-state friction law (1) and (3) as

V = V0 e−kδ/Aσ

−B/A

θ
θ0 (cid:17)

(cid:16)

where V0 and θ0 are the initial values of V and θ respec-
tively. Taking the time derivative of (12), acceleration of
the slider is given by

Thus slip accelerates if ˙θ < −kV θ/σB. Using the state evo-
lution law (2), we get the limit value for the state rate

˙θ =

1 − Bσ/kDc

=

1 − kc/(k(1 − A/B))

(14)

We can rewrite eqs (1,2,5) to get a relation between fric-

tion and state rate

µ = µss(V ) + B ln(1 − ˙θ)

(15)

which gives the value of the friction µa corresponding to
˙V = 0

µa(V ) = µss(V ) + B ln

1 − (1 − A/B)k/kc (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(16)

If both V and ˙θ increase, the slider will eventually de-
celerate before reaching slip instability. For the system to
reach instability, we need both ˙V > 0, ˙θ < 0 and ¨θ < 0 (this
is what we observe in the numerical simulations). The state
acceleration is given by (taking the time derivative of (2),
and using expression (13) of ˙V , and expression (2) of ˙θ)

The system is thus unstable if ¨θ < 0, which gives ˙θ <
1/(1 − kc/k) and yields another expression for the friction
coeﬃcient µl at the stability limit

µl(V ) = µss(V ) + B ln

(18)

1
1 − k/kc (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Slip instabilities can occur only when both B > A and
k < kc; otherwise we can’t have both ˙θ < 0 and ¨θ < 0.
The friction at the stability limit (18) is close to but larger
than the condition for initial acceleration (16) of the slider.
Between these two values, there is thus a range of parame-
ters for which we observe ”slow earthquakes”, followed by a
classic afterslip relaxation, in both the velocity strengthen-
ing or velocity weakening regimes. This behavior is similar
to the observation by Pritchard and Simons [2006] of a slow
slip event triggered by the 1995 mW = 8.1 Chile earthquake.

2.4. Analytical study

We have performed numerical simulations and analytical
study of the slider block model with a ﬁxed loading point
( ˙τr = 0). We found diﬀerent regimes for which the model
exhibits afterslip, with a slip rate decreasing approximately
as a power-law of time.
If initial stress is large enough,
and for special values of the model parameters, the system
exhibits slow earthquakes or aftershocks. The analytical cal-
culations are shown in appendix A, while the main results
are presented in Table 1. Figure 1 illustrates the diﬀerent
regimes as a function of B/A and k/|kc|. The other pa-
rameter that controls the behavior of the slider is initial
stress. The inﬂuence of initial stress is illustrated in Figure
2 for k/|kc| = 0.8 and in Figure 3 for k/|kc| = 2.5. Fig-
ure 4 shows the temporal evolution of velocity, state vari-
able, and friction, for numerical simulations with (top plots)
B/A = 1.5 and k = 0.8kc, and (bottom plots) B/A = 0.5
and k = 2.5|kc|. Each curve corresponds to a diﬀerent value
of initial friction.
2.4.1. Slip and slip rate

We have found several solutions for the slip rate of the

form

V =

V0
(1 + t/t∗)p ,

(19)

where the exponent p is either smaller, equal or greater than
1 depending on the model parameters, and t∗ is a charac-
teristic time, which depends on the initial conditions and on
the friction law parameters. Generally, the system evolves
from one regime to another one with time, so that the appar-
ent exponent p = d ln V /d ln t can either increase or decrease
with time.

In all cases with slip rate decaying with time, displace-
ment is proportional to Dc. Depending on model parame-
ters B/A, k/|kc|, and initial friction, total slip can be either
In the ﬁrst regime, as δ
much smaller or larger than Dc.
becomes of the order of Dc, the system evolves from regime
#1 to #4 if A > B, or from #1 to #6 if A < B. The regimes
#5 and #6 require slip to be much smaller than Aσ/k. If
A > B, slip will eventually become larger than Aσ/k, and
the system will evolve from regime #5 to #4.

If B > A, slip in regime #6 increases much slower with
time, and reaches a constant value at inﬁnite times. There is
thus no transition to another regime. If B ≈ A and ˙θ0 ≪ 1,
then total afterslip on seismogenic faults (with k < kc) can
be much larger than Dc.

When there is a transition to another regime, analytical
solutions in Table 1 have to be modiﬁed by replacing the
initial values θ0, V0, and µ0 by their values at the time the
system enters the new regime, and the slip produced previ-
ously has to be added to the solution for δ and µ.

In the unstable regime, for k < kc and B > A, the sys-
tem will eventually reach regime #6 if µ0 < µl, otherwise it
produces a slip instability (aftershock).

2.4.2. Characteristic times

In all cases, characteristic times t∗ for afterslip are in-
versely proportional to initial slip rate: the faster it slips,
the faster slip rate decays with time. The other parameters
that controls t∗ are friction parameters B/A, stiﬀness k/|kc|,
Dc, and, for cases #5 and #6, the initial friction or state
rate.
2.4.3. State and state rate

In the velocity strengthening regime A > B, state rate
evolves toward ˙θl = 1/(1 − kc/k). Because kc < 0 when
A > B, the asymptotic value of the state rate is in the
range 0 < ˙θl < 1. Thus, except for the special case k = kc,
the system never reaches the steady-state regime ˙θ = 0. De-
crease in velocity with time in the evolution law (2) has to be
balanced by an increase in state and/or state rate. There-
fore, the steady state regime ˙θ = 0 can be reached only at
constant slip rate. We consider the load point is ﬁxed. Thus
slider velocity cannot evolve toward a positive ﬁxed value,
and the slider never stays in the steady state. In the velocity
weakening regime A < B, state rate either decreases toward
−∞ if µ0 > µl(V0), or increases toward 1 if µ0 < µl(V0).
The steady state approximation ˙θ ≈ 0 is thus valid only for
A > B and k ≪ kc.
2.4.4. Friction

Friction during afterslip always decreases with time in
the absence of an external loading ( ˙τr = 0), because µ =
µ0−kδ/σ. Thus even in the ”velocity strengthening regime”,
friction decreases with slip rate if slip rate decreases with
time, while steady-state friction µss(V ) increases with V .
Change in friction with ln V is diﬀerent among the afterslip
regimes in Table 1. The slope of µ as a function of ln V is
A + qB in cases #1-3, A − B in case #4 (with A > B), while
friction is almost independent of ln V in cases #5 and #6.
2.4.5. Slow earthquakes

If initial friction is larger than the condition for initial
acceleration, and lower than the stability criteria (or in
the stable regime A > B), velocity ﬁrst increases, with-
out reaching seismic slip velocities. The slip speed then
decreases as a power-law of time, following the regime #4
if A > B, or #6 if A < B. The maximum slip rate occurs
at times of the order of t∗
If B > A, and if initial fric-
1.
tion is µss(V0) < µ0 < µa(V0), there is a transient phase
in which velocity is almost constant, and healing rate ˙θ in-
creases. This phase can produce aseismic slip larger than
Dc, before the system evolves to regime #6 when ˙θ ≈ 1,
and slip saturates.

2.5. Comparison with observations

Several studies have attempted to measure A or A − B,
and to distinguish between the stable and unstable regimes
from the evolution of stress with slip rate during afterslip.
Miyazaki et al. [2004] have mapped the coseismic and post-
seismic slip produced by the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake,
as well as the change in shear stress on the fault, by in-
verting GPS time series. Most afterslip occurred around
the rupture area, mostly downdip. Within these zones, the
stress-velocity paths approximately follow dτ /d ln(v) = 0.6
MPa. They interpret this result as an evidence that the
main afterslip regions are velocity strengthening. Follow-
ing Marone et al. [1991], they assume that stress is equal
to its steady state value, and suggest that (A − B)σ = 0.6
MPa. According to our analysis, this result would be true
if the system was in the afterslip regime #4, but we cannot
exclude the ﬁrst regime in Table 1. In this case the slope
dτ /d ln(v) = 0.6 would be equal to A + qB instead of A − B,
and we cannot distinguish between the velocity weakening

or strengthening regimes. We can only exclude the unsta-
ble case B > A and k < kc, which never produces a linear
decrease of µ with ln V .

It is diﬃcult to explain with the interpretation of
Miyazaki et al. [2004] why numerous aftershocks occurred
in the areas of large afterslip, because aftershocks cannot
nucleate within zones with A > B. Miyazaki et al. [2004]
suggest small-scale variations in friction parameters A and
B within the afterslip areas in order to explain the spatial
distribution of aftershocks.

Miyazaki et al.

[2004] also found signiﬁcant afterslip
within the rupture area, but with less slip than the surround-
ing zones, of the order of 0.1 m instead of 0.5 m downdip
of the rupture zone. In this zone, stress decreases a little
at short times, and then reloads, because afterslip is larger
in the surrounding areas. They suggest that this behavior
is similar to that of a single degree of freedom slider block
model with a constant loading rate in the velocity weakening
regime.

Hsu et al. [2006] apply the same method to the 2005 Nias
earthquake, and obtain similar result. They use a simpli-
ﬁed form of the rate-and-state friction law (1) with B = 0
[Perfettini and Avouac, 2004], i.e., neglecting healing. They
observe extensive afterslip up-dip from the main shock and
a lack of substantial overlap between seismogenic and aseis-
mic regions. Aftershock zones correspond to the transition
between regions of coseismic and aseismic slip. In the re-
gions of large afterslip, stress decreases roughly linearly with
ln(V ), with a slope dτ /d ln(v) ≈ 0.2 MPa at short times, but
much smaller for times larger than 100 days. In the areas of
smaller afterslip, shear stress increases a little with time, be-
cause these zones are reloaded by surrounding sliping areas.
Hsu et al. [2006] nevertheless measure Aσ from the slope
dτ /d ln(v) ≈ −0.02 MPa, giving unphysical negative values
for A.

2.6. Fitting afterslip data with the rate-and-state
model

We use the afterslip data of the 1987 mW 6.6 Supersti-
tion Hills earthquake in Southern California analyzed by
Wennerberg and Sharp [1997], as well as displacement data
for a creep event on the same fault. High-quality horizon-
tal and vertical afterslip data were obtained from repeated
surveys of six quadrilaterals established on the Superstition
Hills fault [Sharp and Saxton, 1989; Sharp et al., 1989]. The
quads were distributed along approximately 20 km of the
fault, from North to South referred to as N, NC, SC, SSC,
FSSC, and S (see Fig 1 of [Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997]).
For each station, we have 2 measurements of horizontal
strike-slip displacement across the fault (labeled as ”h, S”
and ”h, W ” in Table 2), and one measure of vertical dis-
placement (indicated by a subscript v in Table 2). Stations
N, NC, SC and S were installed before the earthquake. The
other quadrilaterals SSC and FSSC were established 91 days
after the mainshock, and at these sites the later data were
combined with earlier lower-resolution measurements of oﬀ-
set natural features. Wennerberg and Sharp [1997] also ana-
lyzed slip measurements of [Bilham and Behr, 1992] from a
digital creepmeter a few hundred meters to the North of the
FSSC quad (labeled as ”F SSCh,BB ” in Table 2). Following
Wennerberg and Sharp [1997], we analyze the vertical time
series only from the two quads S and SC, because vertical
motions from the other quads are too small. Slip resolution
is about 1 mm for afterslip data, and 0.001 mm for the creep
event. But ﬁt residuals of Wennerberg and Sharp [1997] are
largely controlled by steps (”creep events”), whose ampli-
tude can be as large as 7 mm.

Wennerberg and Sharp [1997] modeled the afterslip mea-
surements using an alternative form of the rate-and-state
friction law (1)

µ =

1 + B ln(1 + θV ∗/Dc)
1 + A ln(1 + V /V ∗)

(20)

and assuming steady-state behavior ˙θ ≈ 0. This friction
law provided a better ﬁt of afterslip data than the steady-
state friction law (5) derived by Scholz [1990]. In particular,
Wennerberg and Sharp [1997] found that slip velocity was
decaying as a power law of time ( 19) with an exponent
p = 1/(1 + B − A) [Wesson, 1988]. This model is thus able
to explain why p values in Table 2 are often larger than 1.
But it requires a very large value of A − B = 0.29 in order to
reproduce the value p = 1.29 observed for afterslip at point
Sz,S.

For one dataset, this model provided unphysical negative
values for A, corresponding to an instantaneous decrease in
friction following an increase in slip rate. Such a behav-
ior has never been observed experimentally. For the other
stations, A is ranging between 0.03 and 0.36, a bit larger
than the values A ≈ 0.01 commonly observed in labora-
tory experiments [Dieterich, 1994]. Wennerberg and Sharp
[1997] inverted for 4 model parameters and 1 initial condi-
tion. Comparison of model parameters obtained for diﬀerent
data sets (2 horizontal slip data S and W at each station,
or using diﬀerent time intervals) suggests that the inverted
parameters are relatively well constrained.

In contrast with previous studies [Marone et al., 1991;
Marone, 1998; Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997; Schaﬀ et al.,
1998; Miyazaki et al., 2004; Mont´esi, 2004; Perfettini and
Avouac, 2004; Hsu et al., 2006], we use the complete rate-
and-state friction law instead of the steady-state approxi-
mation. We do not ﬁt directly the displacement data, but
the ﬁts to the afterslip data obtained by Wennerberg and
Sharp [1997] (see equation (18) and Table 1 of [Wennerberg
and Sharp, 1997]), which ﬁt the data with residuals of the
order of the measurement resolution. We invert for 6 pa-
rameters (instead of 5 in [Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997]) :
A, B, Dc, k, V0 and µ0. We use a Nelder-Mead algorithm
to perform the nonlinear minimization of the slip residuals,
using a large range of initial values for the inverted parame-
ters. Speciﬁcally, the initial model parameters have random
values determined by A = 0.01 × 102rA , B = A(1 + rB/2),
V0 = Vd,0(1 + rV /2), Dc = 0.1 × 102rDc , k = Aσ × 10rk /Dc
and µ0 = rµ, where rA, rB, rDc, rk and rV are chosen ac-
cording to a gaussian distribution of zero mean and standard
deviation equal to 1, rµ is uniformly distributed between 0
and 1, and Vd,0 is the initial velocity determined by Wen-
nerberg and Sharp [1997]. For each data set, we have tested
more than 100 initial models. We thus have a good sampling
of the range of realistic model parameters.

Observed slip velocity is found to decrease with time ap-
proximately as V = V0/(t/t∗ +1)p with a characteristic time
t∗ of the orders of days, and an exponent p ranging between
0.88 and 1.3. (see values in Table 2). Figure 5 shows the
”observed” slip rate (computed from the ﬁt of Wennerberg
and Sharp [1997]) and all our ﬁts with the complete rate-
state friction law with a residue smaller than 1 mm, for
the data set Sh,s (line 12 in Table 12). A simple ﬁt with
V = V0/(t/t∗ + 1)p, i.e., only 3 parameters, already pro-
vides a very good ﬁt to the observations, with a residue of
0.5 mm. This makes it diﬃcult to invert reliably for the 6
parameters of the rate-and-state law. Indeed, we ﬁnd that
there is a huge range of model parameters that ﬁt the data
within the measurement resolution. The inverted parame-
ters appear to be mostly constrained by our choice of initial
values in the optimization. Therefore, we did not report
the inverted model parameters in Table 2. In particular, for
most data sets we cannot distinguish between the velocity
weakening and velocity strengthening regimes, and we can
ﬁt the data as well with k < kc or k > kc. Only the hori-
zontal slip data of the N quad requires A > B. This is the

X - 6

HELMSTETTER AND SHAW : AFTERSLIP, AFTERSHOCKS AND RATE-AND-STATE FRICTION

only station that has an exponent p < 1. Such a behavior
cannot be reproduced with A < B (except over a limited
time interval). The F SSC quad produces diﬀerent results
for independent slip measurements at points separated by a
few meters. For the creep event, all models that ﬁt the data
are in the velocity weakening regime with k > kc.

The critical slip distance inverted from the data ranges
from a few µm to several km, most of the time comparable
to the initial value used in the optimization. Total afterslip
(of the order tens of centimeter) can thus be much larger or
smaller than Dc. Even for seismogenic faults, with B > A
and k < kc, we found models that ﬁtted the data with Dc
as small as 1% of the maximum afterslip.

3. Seismicity rate triggered by afterslip

3.1. Relation between stress and seismicity

Previous studies [Dieterich, 1994; Schaﬀ et al., 1998] have
already suggested that afterslip can trigger aftershocks by
reloading parts of the fault that are locked after the main-
shock. Most studies who suggested that aftershocks are due
to afterslip assumed that aftershock rate is simply propor-
tional to stress or strain rate [Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997;
Schaﬀ et al., 1998; Perfettini and Avouac, 2004; Hsu et al.,
2006]. However, Dieterich [1994] showed that the relation
between seismicity rate and stress rate can be much more
complex. For instance, in the case of a simple stress step
∆τ followed by a constant stressing rate ˙τr, the seismicity
rate R(t) is given by [Dieterich, 1994]

R(t) =

r
(e−∆τ /Aσ − 1) e−t/ta + 1

,

(21)

where ta = Aσn/ ˙τr is the duration of the nucleation phase
of an earthquake, and is also equal to the duration of an
aftershock sequence. r is the seismicity rate for a constant
stressing rate equal to ˙τr. Aftershock rate increases imme-
diately after the stress step, and then decreases with time
back to R = r for t ≫ ta. Typically, ta is of the order of
years [Dieterich, 1994]. This shows that there can be a very
long time delay between a change in stress and triggered
seismicity. The assumption that aftershock rate is propor-
tional to stress rate for earthquakes triggered by afterslip
thus needs to be veriﬁed.

Dieterich [1994] derived a general relation between stress
rate and seismicity rate, which we use to model seismicity
triggered by afterslip

where γ is a seismicity state variable, which evolves as

R =

˙γ =

We can rewrite (23) as

(26)

For rapid variations of seismicity rate, we can neglect the
second term in (25). The seismicity rate thus increases ex-
ponentially with stress

R = R0 exp(τ /Aσ)

(27)

Beeler and Lockner [2003] measured the correlation be-
tween seismicity rate and stress in laboratory friction ex-
periments, with a periodic perturbation of the stress rate
superposed to a constant loading rate. They found that the
relation between seismicity rate and stress is in good agree-
ment with expression (26) for slow stress changes, and with
equation (27) for fast stress changes. Expression (27) also
provides a good ﬁt to seismicity triggered by tides [Cochran
et al., 2004], though the small values of the stress change
τ /Aσ do not allow to test if R increases proportionally or
exponentially with τ .

3.2. Application to model seismicity triggered by
afterslip
Stress rate

We have shown previously that slip rate in the rate
and state model can be modeled by a power law decay
V = V0/(1 + t/t∗)p, with a characteristic time t∗, and an
exponent p that depend on the friction law parameters B/A
and k/kc, and on the initial conditions V0 and µ0. Initial
slip rate and friction are likely to be very heterogeneous, due
to variations of coseismic slip. As a consequence, areas of
the fault that are approximately locked after the mainshock
(small V0) will be reloaded by adjacent areas with larger slip
rate. Using our simple slider-block model, we can model the
stress rate induced by afterslip as

˙τ = kV =

kV0
(1 + t/t∗)p

(28)

where V represents the diﬀerence in slip rate between
”locked” and ”slipping” parts of the fault.
Special case p = 1

There is an analytical solution to equation (23) with stress
following (28) only for the special case p = 1, which is given
by

R =

C(1 + t/t∗)−n +

(31)

˙τ0 = kV0 is initial stress rate. For large stress rate, the
second term is negligible in (30) and C ≈ 1/ ˙τr.

In this case p = 1, the seismicity rate ﬁrst increases with

time and reaches its maximum value for time equal to

tRmax = t∗

(C ˙τ0(n + 1))1/(n+1) − 1
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

.

(32)

For R changing slowly in time, we can neglect the ﬁrst
term in (25). So the seismicity rate is proportional to the

As stress change increases, tRmax decreases. For times larger
than tRmax , seismicity rate predicted by (29) decreases pro-

.

(33)

For large n (large stress rate), expression (33) recovers ex-
pression (26) for the stress-seismicity relation that is valid
for slowly varying R.
General case p 6= 1

For p 6= 1, we found numerically that expression (33) is
still a rather good approximation of the time tRmax at which
R reaches its maximum. At intermediate times t > tRmax
expression (33) also provides a good ﬁt to the seismicity rate,
i.e., seismicity rate is proportional to stress rate. However, if
p > 1, we found in numerical simulations of (25) that there
is a characteristic time tc after which expression (33) does
not hold. Typical evolutions of seismicity rate and stress
rate are shown in Figure 6 for p = 1.3 and in Figure 7 for
p = 0.8.

If p > 1, stress and thus number of events N will satu-
rate for t ≫ t∗. The stress change will increase toward a
maximum value ∆τ given by

∆τ =

˙τ dt =

∞

Z

˙τ0t∗
p − 1

.

(34)

The ﬁrst term ∼ ln(R) will become non negligible compared
with the term ∼ N in (25). The seismicity rate for large
times t ≫ t∗ and t ≫ tRmax will thus be equivalent to that
triggered by an instantaneous stress step of amplitude ∆τ ,
described by equation (21). The ”long time seismicity rate”,
for tc ≪ t ≪ ta, evolves according to R ≈ rAσ/t ˙τr (assum-
ing tc ≫ ta exp(−∆τ /Aσ)).

The transition from the regime R ≈ r ˙τ / ˙τr described by
(33) for tRmax ≪ t ≪ tc to the regime R ≈ rAσ/t ˙τr for
t ≫ tc will occur at a time tc given by ˙τ (tc) = Aσ/tc. As-
suming tc ≫ t∗, we get

tc = t∗n1/(p−1) .

(35)

If there is a non-zero constant stress rate ˙τr, in addi-
tion to the stress rate (28) induced by afterslip, seismicity
rate decays as the inverse of time for tc ≪ t ≪ ta, until
it reaches its background level r. The number of events
triggered by afterslip can be computed directly from (25).
When R returns to its initial value R0 = r and τ = ∆τ , the
ﬁrst term is equal to zero in (25) and N = r∆τ / ˙τr. This
results is independent of the form of the stress change, as
long as stress reaches a maximum value ∆τ at long times.
The stress change needed to explain the observed number of
aftershocks is thus the same for static triggering (stress step
of amplitude ∆τ ), and for triggering due to afterslip.

For a slow decay of stress rate with time p < 1, which
requires A > B (see Table 1), stress does not saturate for
t ≫ t∗ but instead increases as τ =
˙τ dt ∼ t1−p for t ≫ t∗.
Seismicity rate thus never reaches the regime described by
(21) with R ∼ 1/t. In this case, seismicity rate is propor-
tional to stress rate as predicted by (33) for t > tRmax.

t

This work shows that seismicity rate triggered by afterslip
does not always scale with slip rate, as assumed by [Wen-
nerberg and Sharp, 1997; Schaﬀ et al., 1998; Perfettini and
Avouac, 2004; Hsu et al., 2006]. For instance, we can observe
V ∼ ˙τ ∼ t−p with p > 1 but R ∼ 1/t. The characteristic
times tRmax and tc that control seismicity rate are also dif-
ferent from the characteristic time t∗ which controls afterslip
rate.
Comparison with aftershock data

Aftershock studies [Helmstetter et al., 2005; Peng et al.,
2007] have shown that seismicity rate decreases with time

according to R ∼ R0/(1 + t/c)p, with a characteristic time
c that is no larger than 10 sec, and an exponent p that can
be either smaller or larger than 1, and is usually between
0.9 and 1.2 [Reasenberg and Jones, 1994; Helmstetter et al.,
2003]. Seismicity rate can increase by a factor up to 105
relative to the background rate. The duration of aftershock
sequences is of the order of years, i.e., about 106 larger than
the characteristic time c.

In order to explain aftershock triggering by afterslip, we
need the characteristic times t∗ to be of the order of seconds.
This is much smaller than the values of t∗ of a few days es-
timated for afterslip data following Superstition Hills earth-
quake [Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997] (see Table 2). However,
afterslip was measured at the surface, we can expect strong
ﬂuctuations of t∗ with depth due to changes of friction pa-
rameters or initial values. t∗ may thus be much smaller at
depth, where aftershocks nucleate.

Afterslip following the mW = 8.7 2005 Nias earthquake,
and measured by GPS, also produces t∗ of the order of 3 days
[Hsu et al., 2006] for all GPS points. Hsu et al. [2006] found
that both displacement and aftershock number increase log-
arithmically with time ∼ ln(1 + t/t∗), with t∗ ≈ 3 days.
However, they counted the number of m > 3 aftershocks
triggered by the mainshock, while the catalog is not com-
plete for such small events, and the completeness level de-
creases with time after the mainshock. Using only m ≥ 5.5
aftershocks, we measured t∗ ≈ 0.1 day, much smaller than
the characteristic time of afterslip inferred from GPS mea-
surements. It is thus unlikely that early aftershocks of the
Nias earthquake are governed by afterslip.

As shown above, the stress change involved to trigger N
events is the same for static triggering and for triggering by
afterslip. Because the amplitude of afterslip is often com-
parable to coseismic slip [Pritchard and Simons, 2006], the
number of events triggered by afterslip should be compa-
rable to that triggered by coseismic stress change, in the
unstable areas of the faults with B > A and k < kc.
If
p ≈ 1, or for static triggering, the stress change needed
to produce an increase of seismicity rate by a factor 105 is
∆τ = Aσ ln(105) = 11.5Aσ.
If Aσ ≈ 0.1 MPa, as sug-
gested by Cochran et al. [2004], this gives realistic values,
smaller than the average stress drop. On the other hand,
if we use the laboratory value A ≈ 0.01 [Dieterich, 1994],
and a normal stress σ = 100 MPa (of the order of the litho-
static pressure at a depth of about 5 km), then the stress
change needed is ∆τ = 11.5 MPa. This seems quite large,
however it is possible that maximum stress change can lo-
cally reach such values. As shown by Helmstetter and Shaw
[2006], seismicity rate triggered by a heterogeneous stress
change at short times is controlled by the maximum stress
change rather than the mean value.

If we want to reproduce observations of seismicity rate de-
caying with p > 1 over several decades in time, we need even
larger stress change than for p ≤ 1. For instance, following
the 1992 mW 7.3 Landers earthquake, the seismicity rate de-
creased with time as R ∼ t−1.2 over 5 decades in time. To
explain this pattern, we thus need tc ≥ 105tRmax. We have
computed the seismicity rate triggered by the stress change
modeled by (28) with p = 1.2, using numerical integration of
equation (25). We found that the stress change ∆τ deﬁned
by (34) required to get tc ≥ 105tRmax is ∆τ ≈ 50Aσ.

4. Conclusion

We have modeled the postseismic slip of faults using the
rate-and-state friction law. The postseismic behavior of
faults is more complex than predicted previously based on
the steady state approximation of the friction law. We found
that, depending on the model parameters B/A and k/|kc|,
and on initial friction, the fault exhibits either decaying af-
terslip, slow earthquakes, or aftershocks. Afterslip, with

X - 8

HELMSTETTER AND SHAW : AFTERSLIP, AFTERSHOCKS AND RATE-AND-STATE FRICTION

slip amplitude comparable or even larger than Dc, can be
obtained for any value of the friction law parameters, even
for velocity weakening faults (B > A). We have derived sev-
eral approximate solutions to describe the evolution of slip,
state and friction with time. There are several regimes with
diﬀerent characteristic times t∗ and exponents p for which
afterslip decays according to V = V0/(1 + t/t∗)p. This ex-
pression of the slip rate provides a very good ﬁt to afterslip
data [Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997], with t∗ of the order of
days, and p ranging between 0.9 and 1.3. The number of
parameters of the rate-and-state model is too large in order
to invert from afterslip data. For most data sets we studied,
afterslip can be modeled as well with velocity weakening or
strengthening friction parameters. Therefore, we don’t need
to involve spatial or temporal changes in the friction law
parameter B/A in order to explain the evolution between
aseismic and seismic slip.

Aftershock decay with time (Omori law) is similar to that
observed for afterslip rate. This similarity led several au-
thors to suggest that aftershocks are induced by the postseis-
mic reloading of the fault due to afterslip. Using the relation
between stress and seismicity derived by Dieterich [1994],
we have shown that afterslip is indeed a possible mechanism
to explain aftershock triggering. But the relation between
slip rate and seismicity rate is more complex than previ-
ously thought [Wennerberg and Sharp, 1997; Schaﬀ et al.,
1998; Perfettini and Avouac, 2004; Hsu et al., 2006]. The
process of earthquake nucleation indeed introduces a time
delay between stress change and triggered earthquakes. As
a consequence, seismicity rate is characterized by exponents
and characteristic times that can be diﬀerent from those
that control stress rate. The complexity of the friction law
thus makes it diﬃcult to infer the mechanisms responsi-
ble for earthquake triggering based on observations of stress
changes. Moreover, we have simpliﬁed the problem by con-
sidering uniform values of the model parameters, and of the
slip rate, by modeling the fault with a simple slider block
with one degree of freedom. We have also neglected other
processes that may play an important role in the evolution
of faults, such as ﬂuid ﬂow, viscous deformation, dynamic
stress changes, and subcritical crack growth, among other
mechanisms, all of which could have their own time depen-
dence. The modeling of fault slip and seismicity, and even
more the characterization of the fault rheology based on seis-
micity or geodesy data, is thus a diﬃcult challenge, in terms
of ﬁnding which mechanism may be causing an observed
time dependence. In this paper, we have added to this diﬃ-
culty by demonstrating additional time dependent behavior
in the primary candidate, the rate and state friction law.

the system is initially close to steady state, i.e.,
then θ0 ≈ Dc/V0 = t∗/q. The transition to the next
regime occurs at times of the order of θ0, when the slip
is δ ≈ Dcq ln(1 + 1/q) ≈ Dc. The slip generated during this
phase thus reaches a maximum value of the order of Dc be-
fore the transition to the next regime when the second term
in (A4) dominates, which is regime #4 in Table 1.

If q < 0, then t∗ < 0 and equation (A1) describes a power-
law singularity of slip rate (earthquake).
In this case, we
recover the solution derived by [Dieterich, 1994] for earth-
quake nucleation in the absence of external loading ( ˙τr = 0).
This solution is valid only for large stress µ(V ) > µa(V ),
i.e., when slip rate initially increases with time. This cor-
responds to regime #2 in Table 1.
In addition, the sys-
tem will not reach instability if ¨θ > 0, corresponding to
µ(V ) < µl(V ). If µ(V ) < µl(V ), fault healing accelerates,
eventually forcing slip rate to decrease with time. This cor-
responds with the slow earthquake case, discussed in Section
2.4.5, of regime #2 transforming to regime #6, or regime #3
transforming to regime #4 or regime #6; see Figure 1.

The second term (t∗ + t)/(q + 1) dominates at large times
if q > 0 and t∗ > 0. Putting this approximate solution
θ = (t∗ + t)/(q + 1) in (A2), this gives

This characteristic time is the same as found by Scholz
[1990] using the steady state approximation. The friction co-
eﬃcient given by (1,A4) is µ = µ0 + (A − B) ln(V /V0), equal

to the steady-state value. However our solution (A1,A4) is
not at steady state; healing rate given by (A3) is

˙θ =

1
1 + t∗V0/Dc

=

1
1 − kc/k

.

(A10)

This corresponds to regime #4.

We also found another regime for which slip rate decays
as a power of time, with an exponent B/A. This regime
characterizes afterslip when δ ≪ Aσ/k, i.e., when change in
friction due to slip is negligible. With this approximation,
slip rate (12) can be rewritten as

θ
θ0 (cid:17)
and the evolution law (2) becomes

V = V0

This solution has no analytical solution. To obtain simple
solutions, we further assume that either (i) B ≈ A, so that
˙θ ≈ 1 − V0θ0/Dc, or (ii) slip rate is small, so that ˙θ ≈ 1.
State variable is thus given by θ = θ0 + ˙θ0t, and slip rate
obeys

Our solution (A13) can be applied as well in the velocity
weakening case, corresponding to regime #5, or velocity
strengthening case, corresponding to regime #6. In the sta-
ble regime, the solution (A13) will be followed by the other
power law decay described by (A1,A9), when slip becomes
large compared with Aσ/k.

Figure 4. Temporal evolution of slip rate (a,f), slip rate
exponent d ln V /d ln t (b,g), state rate (c,h), slip (d,i),
as well as variation of friction with slip rate (e,j), for
numerical simulations with B = 1.5A and k = 0.8kc (top,
a-e), and B = 0.5A and k = 2.5|kc| (bottom, f-j). Each
curve corresponds to a diﬀerent value of initial friction.
In (a-e), initial friction µ0 is µss(V0) − B (black curve),
µss(V0) + B (blue), and µss(V0) + 2B (red). In (f-j), µ0
equals µss(V0)−8B (black), µss(V0) (blue), and µss(V0)+
8B (red).

Figure 6. Seismicity rate (a) triggered by a continuous
stress change given by ˙τ = ˙τ0/(1 + t/t∗)p (red curve)
and by a simple stress step of the same amplitude ∆τ =
˙τ0t∗/(p−1) = 2.08 MPa (black curve). Plot (b) shows the
stress rate (continuous line) and stress change (dashed
line). The model parameters are ˙τ0 = 0.62 MPa/day,
t∗ = 1 day, ˙τr = 10−8 MPa/day (constant stress rate) and
Aσ = 0.1 MPa. This gives n = 6.2, C = 108. The time
tRmax calculated using the approximate solution (32) is
14.6 days, while the observed time when R is maximum
is 42 days. The crossover time tc given by (35) is 450
days, and marks the transition between a ∼ 1/tp decay
of seismicity rate for tRmax < t < tc to the long time
∼ 1/t decay.

Figure 7. Same as in Figure 6 for p = 0.8, but with
the same values of t∗ and ˙τ0. The time tRmax calculated
using the approximate solution (32) is 9.4 days, while
the observed time when R is maximum is 14.6 days. The
seismicity rate is proportional to the stress rate for t >
tRmax.

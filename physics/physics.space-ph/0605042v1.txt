Abstract. Using the low-resolution mode of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST), we have obtained spatially resolved spectra of 20 ultracool dwarfs. 18 of them belong to 9
known very low-mass binary systems with angular separations in the range 0.′′
098. We have derived spectral
types in the range dM7.5 to dL6 from the PC3 index, and by comparing our STIS spectra with ground-based
spectra of similar spectral resolution from Mart´ın et al. (1999). We have searched for Hα emission in each object but
it was clearly detected in only 2 of them. We ﬁnd that the distribution of Hα emission in our sample is statistically
diﬀerent from that of single ﬁeld dwarfs, suggesting an intriguing anticorrelation between chromospheric activity
and binarity for M7–M9.5 dwarfs. We provide measuments of the strength of the main photospheric features and
the PC3 index, and we derive calibrations of spectral subclasses versus F814W and K-band absolute magnitudes
for a subset of 10 dwarfs in 5 binaries that have known trigonometric parallaxes.

1. Introduction

Late-type nearby spatially resolved binaries (usually re-
ferred to as visual binaries) have been patiently followed
up for many decades to obtain orbital parameters (e.g.,
van de Kamp 1938; Couteau 1957; Chang 1972; Abt &
Levy 1973). The dynamical masses obtained from the
studies of resolved binaries have been used to calibrate
the mass-luminosity relationship for low-mass stars (e.g.,
Delfosse et al. 2000). A number of recent surveys have
extended the search for resolved binaries to very low-
mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs (BDs). Hubble Space
Telescope imaging has been used to search for VLM bi-
naries1 in young associations and open clusters (Mart´ın
et al. 2000b, 2003; Kraus et al. 2005) and in the solar
neighborhood (Mart´ın et al. 1998, 1999; Reid et al. 2001;
Bouy et al. 2003; Burgasser et al. 2003; Gizis et al. 2003;
Golimowski et al. 2004). Near infrared-imaging on large
ground-based telescopes, usually assisted by adaptive op-
tics, has also been eﬀective in ﬁnding VLM binaries (e.g.,

has a primary with spectral type M6 and later.

Koerner et al. 1999; Mart´ın et al. 2000a; Close et al. 2003;
Potter et al. 2002; Siegler et al. 2005). These studies have
determined that the binary frequency among ﬁeld VLM
stars and BDs in the separation range 1-15 AU is about
15% , and that there is a sharp drop in the binary fre-
quency for separations larger than 15 AU. Nevertheless, a
few examples of wider ﬁeld ultracool binaries are known
(Mart´ın et al. 1998, 2000b; Bill`eres et al. 2005; Phan Bao
et al. 2005; Burgasser & McElwain 2006). On the other
hand, it is not clear what the VLM binary frequency is
within 1 AU because of the lack of long-term spectro-
scopic binary surveys for VLM stars and BDs. The sta-
tistical properties of VLM binaries will continue to be in-
vestigated because they provide a fundamental constraint
for models of VLM star formation (Kroupa et al. 2003;
Umbreit et al. 2005).

The increasing number of VLM binaries can be used
for follow-up studies of their properties. Astrometric mon-
itoring of three VLM binaries have yielded the ﬁrst es-
timates of the orbital parameters and dynamical masses
(Lane et al. 2001; Bouy et al. 2004; Brandner et al. 2004).
Spatially-resolved low-resolution spectroscopic follow-up
has been made in a few cases and spectral types have been
obtained (Lane et al. 2001; Goto et al. 2002; Potter et al.
2002; Bouy et al. 2004; Chauvin et al. 2004; Luhman 2004,

STIS observations of ultracool binaries

2005; McCaughrean et al. 2004; Billeres et al. 2005; and
Burgasser & McElwain 2006). Resolved high-resolution
spectroscopic observations have been reported for only
one VLM binary, namely GJ 569 B, and have allowed to
dynamically estimate the individual masses of each com-
ponent (Zapatero Osorio et al. 2004; Simon et al. 2006).
Accurate dynamical masses for an eclipsing BD binary
have also been reported recently (Stassun et al. 2006).

In this paper, we present resolved low resolution spec-
troscopic observations of 9 VLM binaries, which represent
a signiﬁcant increase in the number of members of VLM
systems that have been characterized spectroscopically. In
section 2, we describe the selection of the sample, the STIS
observations and the processing of the data. In section 3
we describe the spectra, and we present the determination
of the spectral types. Section 4 deals with the discussion
of chromospheric activity and the main absorption fea-
tures in our sample, and we derive calibrations of spectral
subclass versus absolute magnitudes for the components
of VLM binaries with known parallaxes. Finally, section 5
summarizes our results.

2. Observations and data processing

Our sample was selected from known VLM binaries with
separations in the range 0.′′37-0.′′098 and I-band magnitude
brighter than I=19, so that resolved optical low-resolution
spectroscopy of each component could be obtained with
STIS. Table 1 provides the STIS observing log. The ob-
servations of 2MASSW J07464256+2000321 have already
been presented in Bouy et al. (2004) but we also include
them in our analysis for completeness.

Our goal was to obtain spatially resolved spectra of
each component of the binary systems. However, schedul-
ing constraints of HST made it impossible to perfectly
align the slit along the axis of each binary. In one case,
namely DENIS-P J144137.3-094559, we could not get any
spectrum of the secondary because the slit was not ori-
ented along the binary semimajor axis. Another case,
namely 2MASSW J0920122+351742, turned out not to
be resolved at the epoch of observations. It is possible
that this object may not be a binary because it has been
resolved in only one epoch (Bouy et al. 2006, in prepa-
ration). For the other binaries we obtained resolved 2-D
spectra and performed the extraction of the two spectra
as explained in detail in Bouy et al. (2004). An example
of the de-blending of spectra in two of our binary systems
(including one of the tightest) is shown in Figure 1. We
used the bias, ﬂat ﬁeld and wavelength calibrations pro-
vided by the HST pipeline.

The grating used was the G750L centered at 775.1 nm,
and the aperture was 52.′′0 long by 0.′′2 wide. The to-
tal wavelength range of each spectrum is 525–1100 nm,
but the usable range depends on the brightness and the
spectral type of each object. Residual fringing is clearly
present at wavelengths longer than about 900 nm. The
nominal dispersion is 4.92 ˚A/pixel and according to the
STIS handbook, our slit width is expected to project onto

4 pixels (FWHM = 20 ˚A). For comparison the resolution
quoted by Kirkpatrick et al. (1999) was 9 ˚A, and the res-
olution of the spectra presented in Mart´ın et al. (1999)
(hereafter M99) was 12 ˚A. Thus, our STIS data have a
resolution somewhat lower than those papers. In Figure 2
we display ﬁnal spectra for three of our targets spanning
the whole range of spectral subclasses in our sample.

3. Spectral classiﬁcation

Our resolved STIS spectra of VLM binaries allowed us to
determine the spectral type of each component. Only two
of our program binaries have previous determinations of
spectral type for each component: Lane et al. (2001) gave
spectral types of M8.5 and M9 for GJ 569 Ba and Bb,
respectively, using low-resolution near-infrared (J-band)
spectra. Bouy et al. (2004) obtained spectral types of
dL0 and dL1.5 for 2MASSW J0746425+200032 A and
B, respectively, using the same STIS data as this work.
They compared the STIS spectra with ground-based low-
resolution spectra from M99.

In this work we have estimated the spectral subclasses
using two methods: (a) we measured the PC3 index de-
ﬁned by M99 and used their PC3-spectral type relation-
ship for M and L dwarfs, and (b) we compared our spectra
with those of M99 and chose the best match. The spec-
tral subclasses obtained from both approaches are given
in Table 2. When the subclasses from the two methods
agreed with 1 subclass, we computed the average and we
rounded in steps of 0.5 subclass. When there was a dis-
agreement, we favored the subclass derived from method
(b). This happened only for the latest L dwarfs of our
sample.

3.1. Description of the spectra of each binary

In this subsection the STIS spectra of each target are dis-
played and they are compared with the best matching M99
spectra:

– DENIS-P J020529.0-115925 A (dL5): The K i reso-
nance doublet is slightly broader, and the CrH and
FeH bands are weaker than in the M99 spectrum of
DENIS-P J1228-2415 (Figure 3). The M99 spectrum
of DENIS-P J0205-1159 is the best match to our STIS
spectrum of DENIS-P J020529.0-115925 A, indicating,
as expected, that the primary dominates the composite
ground-based spectrum. We note that the PC3 index
gives a slightly earlier subclass of dL4.1 than the spec-
trum matching technique.

– DENIS-P J020529.0-115925 B (dL6): The CrH and
FeH bands have almost vanished. The M99 spectrum
of DENIS-P J0255-4700 is the best match except for
the steam band at 930 nm, which is stronger in the
ground-based spectrum (Figure 3). This could be due
to the contribution of telluric absorption in the M99
spectrum. We also note that the STIS spectra are noisy

Mart´ın et al.

in this region due to low quantum eﬃciency of the de-
tector and the presence of a strong interference pattern
at these red wavelengths. The PC3 index gives a spec-
tral type 2 subclasses earlier than the spectrum match,
suggesting that this index is not reliable for the latest
L dwarfs.

– DENIS-P J035726.9-441730 A (dM9): As shown in
Figure 4, the best match spectrum from M99 is that of
DENIS-P 1431-1953 (dM9). In the ground-based spec-
trum the region from 740 nm to 770 nm is aﬀected by
telluric absorption. The PC3 index also gives a sub-
class of dM9 in perfect agreement with the spectrum
match.

– DENIS-P J035726.9-441730 B (dL1.5): As shown in
Figure 4, the best match spectrum from M99 is that of
DENIS-P 1441-0945 (dL1). In the ground-based spec-
trum the region from 740 nm to 770 nm is aﬀected by
telluric absorption so it is not surprising the mismatch
between the STIS data and the M99 data over this
wavelength coverage. A similar discrepancy is seen in
the spectra of all our late-M and early-L dwarfs. The
PC3 index gives a slightly later subclass of dL1.6. We
averaged the two methods and rounded our adopted
subclass to dL1.5.

– DENIS-P J100428.3-114648 A (dM9.5): Both the
PC3 index and the best match spectrum (DENIS-
P 1208+0149) give a spectral subclass of dM9.5
(Figure 5).

– DENIS-P J100428.3-114648 B (dL0.5): The PC3 index
gives dM9.9 but the STIS spectrum appears to inter-
mediate between a dL0 (DENIS-P 0909-0658) and a
dL1 (DENIS-P 1441-0945) as illustrated in Figure 5.
We adopt a subclass of dL0.5 by interpolating between
dL0 and dL1.

– DENIS-P J122821.6-241541 A (dL4): The PC3 index
gives dL3.9 and the M99 spectrum of LHS 102 B (dL4)
is the best spectral match (Figure 6). The Li i res-
onance doublet is not detected even though it has
been clearly seen from the ground (Mart´ın et al. 1997;
Tinney et al. 1997). This non detection is due to the
low signal to noise ratio and low resolution of our STIS
data.

– DENIS-P J122821.6-241541 B (dL4.5): The PC3 index
gives dL4.2 and the M99 spectrum of DENIS-P J1228-
2415 (bdL4.5) is the best spectral match (Figure 6).
The Li i resonance doublet is not detected because of
the low signal to noise ratio of our data at 670.8 nm.
– DENIS-P J144137.3-094559 A (dL1): The PC3 in-
dex gives dL1.3, and the best M99 match is DENIS-
P J1441-0945 itself (Figure 7). We note that DENIS-
P J144137.3-094559 is a common proper motion com-
panion of the star G124-62 (dM4.5, Seifahrt, Guenther
& Neuhauser 2005), which is a member of the Hyades
supercluster.

– GJ 569 Ba (dM9): The PC3 index gives a subtype of
dM9.2 and the best spectral match is DENIS-P 1431-
1953 (dM9) so there is good agreement between the
two methods.

– GJ 569 Bb (dM9): The PC3 index gives a subtype
of dM8.6, but the best match is also DENIS-P 1431-
1953 (Figure 8). This example underlines the beneﬁts
of using several criteria to determine accurate spec-
tral subclasses among ultracool dwarfs. If the spectral
class were assigned using only the PC3 index, we would
give a slightly earlier subclass to GJ 569 Bb than to
GJ 569 Ba, which is not consistent with the properties
of this binary.

– 2MASSW J0746425+200032 A (dL0): The PC3 in-
dex gives a subclass of dM9.5 but the best match is
DENIS-P 0909-0658 (dL0) as shown in Bouy et al.
(2004). The CrHλ861.1 nm and FeHλ869.2 nm bands
are stronger than in M dwarfs. However, the CrH and
FeH bands are not stronger than the nearby TiO band
at 843.2 nm.

– 2MASSW J0746425+200032 B (dL1.5): The PC3 in-
dex gives a subclass of dM9.6 but the best match is
intermediate between DENIS-P 1441-0945 (dL1) and
Kelu 1 (dL2), as shown in Bouy et al. (2004). The TiO
and VO bands are weaker, and the . CrH and FeH
bands are stronger than in the A component.

– 2MASSW J0920122+351742 (dL5): The PC3 index
gives a subclass of dL5.2 and the best match is DENIS-
P J0205-1159 (dL5) as shown in Figure 9, so there is
good agreement between the two methods.

– 2MASSW J1146344+223052 A (dL2): The PC3 in-
dex gives a subclass of dL1.4 and the best spectral
match is Kelu 1 (bdL2) as shown in Figure 10. The
K i resonance lines become so broad that the doublet
is blended. They are clearly broader than for the dL1.
The CrH and FeH bands are stronger than for the dL1
and the TiO bands are weaker.

– 2MASSW J1146344+223052 B (dL2): The PC3 index
gives a subclass of dL1.7 and the best spectral match is
Kelu 1 (bdL2) as shown in Figure 10. Bouy et al. (2003)
reported a magnitude diﬀerence in the F814W ﬁlter of
0.75 mag., which is conﬁrmed by new ACS images (H.
Bouy 2006, private communication). The similar spec-
tral types but diﬀerent brightness of these two dwarfs
suggests that 2MASSW J1146344+223052 A could be
an unresolved binary with nearly equal components.
Thus, 2MASSW J1146344+223052 may be a triple sys-
tem. Very low-mass triple systems may not be rare as
indicated by the recent observations of GJ 900 (Mart´ın
2003) and DENIS-P J020529.0-115925 (Bouy et al.
2005). Conﬁrmation of the suspected unresolved bi-
narity of 2MASSW J1146344+223052 A requires high
angular resolution observations or radial velocity mon-
itoring.

– 2MASSW J1311391+803222 A,B (dM7.5, dM8). As
shown in Figure 11, the STIS spectra of both compo-
nents are nearly identical. The spectral type inferred
from the PC3 index are dM7.3 for A and dM7.6 for
B. The best spectral match for the A component is
LHS2243 (dM7.5) and for the B component is VB10
(dM8). The two lines of the K i resonance doublet
can be distinguished with our spectral resolution. The

4

766.5 nm line is stronger than the 769.9 nm line. The
Cs i is too weak to be seen in our spectra. The TiO and
VO bands are conspicuous and the small 0.5 subclass
diﬀerence is best seen in the VO band at 740 nm.
– 2MASSW J1426316+155701 A (dM8) and B (dL1.5):
The spectrum of component A is very similar to that
of VB10, which agrees with the dM8 subclass obtained
from the PC3 measurement, while the spectrum of the
component B is intermediate between that of DENIS-
P J1441-0945 (dL1) and Kelu 1 (bdL2) as illustrated
in Figure 12.

4. Discussion

4.1. Chromospheric activity and binarity

Hα emission is an indicator of chromospheric activity due
to nonthermal heating by magnetic ﬁelds. We have de-
tected Hα emission in only 2 of our objects. We give
the equivalent widths measurements or upper limits in
Table 3. We did not see any ﬂares, which usually display
a variety of strong emission lines in late-M and L dwarfs
(Liebert et al. 1999; Mart´ın 1999; Mart´ın & Ardila 2001).
In Figure 13, we display a zoom of the Hα region for
most of our targets. Our three coolest L dwarfs (dL5–
dL6) are missing from the plot because they do not have
enough continuum for equivalent width determination at
these wavelengths. We have compared the distribution of
Hα emission equivalent width with respect to spectral
subclass in our sample with the measurements obtained
by Gizis et al. (2000) for ﬁeld dwarfs. We performed a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check whether the two dis-
tributions of Hα emission equivalent width values are sta-
tistically diﬀerent or similar. We binned the data in steps
of 0.5 subclasses, so there were 6 spectral bins in the range
dM7–dM9.5. We found that the two distributions of spec-
tral types are 90% similar, but their associated distribu-
tions of Hα equivalent widths are diﬀerent with high level
of conﬁdence (99.9%). Our sample of resolved binary com-
ponents tends to show lower Hα activity than single ﬁeld
dwarfs in the spectral range dM7–dM9.5. The situation is
unclear for L dwarfs because there are too few datapoints.
Our results indicate that there could be an anticorrela-
tion between chromospheric activity and resolved binarity
for the latest dMs. This connection may be due to diﬀerent
angular momentum histories in the binary components, al-
though this is not very likely because there is not a good
connection between activity and rotation for these late
dwarfs (Mohanty & Basri 2003). On the other hand, chro-
mospheric activity has been suggested to be enhanced in
some late-type dwarfs after impact of asteroids or comets
(e.g. AB Dor, G´omez de Castro 2002). A “planetesimal-
impact” hypothesis to explain ﬂares in cool stars has
also been discussed in the literature (Hertzsprung 1924;
Andrews 1991). Our results may lend support to this hy-
pothesis because in the binaries of our sample there may
be less debris material due to disk clearing by the compo-
nents of the binary system. In single very-late dMs, debris

material may last over periods of time longer than for
solar-type stars because of the reduced eﬀect of disk dis-
sipation processes such as the Poynting-Robertson drag.

4.2. Alkali lines

We searched for the Li i resonance line in our spectra. This
line is a useful diagnostic of the age and mass of ultracool
dwarfs (Magazz`u et al. 1993; Mart´ın et al. 1994) and it
has been detected in the unresolved spectra of one of our
program binaries with equivalent widths in the range 2-4
˚A (DENIS-P J122821.6-241541 A,B; Mart´ın et al. 1997;
Tinney, Delfosse & Forveille 1997). However, we could not
detect it in our spectrum of DENIS-P J122821.6-241541 A.
We conclude that the resolution and limited signal to noise
ratio of our STIS spectra do not allow us to detect Li i
resonance lines with equivalent widths smaller than about
5 ˚A, implying that we cannot set useful constrains of the
lithium abundance of our program dwarfs.

We measured the K i resonance doublet at 766.5 and
769.9 nm. For the dwarfs where we could distinguish the
two lines, we used the gaussian deblending option in the
IRAF package splot. The equivalent widths obtained are
given in Table 3 and their dependence with spectral class
is illustrated in Figure 14. At subclass dL2 and later the
doublet becomes extremely broad and the two lines are
blended (Mart´ın et al. 1997, 1999; Burrows & Sharp 1999;
Kirkpatrick et al. 1999). For those dLs we provide the
equivalent width of the blended pair. The Na i subordinate
doublet at 818.4 and 819.5 nm could not be measured
because of a bad column in the array. The Cs i at 852.1
and 894.3 nm were strong enough in the coolest objects
to measure the equivalent width (Table 3).

The scatter in the equivalent widths of the K i res-
onance doublet as a function of spectral class that is
seen in Figure 14 is likely due to its well-known sensi-
tivity to surface gravity (M99). For example, we note that
GJ 569 Ba and Bb (dM9) have weaker K i equivalent width
than 2MASSW J1426316+155701 A (dM8) and DENIS-
P J100428.3-114648 A (dM9.5). Weaker K i is an indica-
tion of lower surface gravity, and consequently a younger
age and lower mass for a given spectral subclass. The age
of GJ 569 B has been estimated to be young (∼300 Myr)
by Zapatero Osorio et al. (2004) using evolutionary tracks.
It is likely that the ages of DENIS-P J100428.3-114648
and 2MASSW J1426316+155701 are older than that of
GJ 569 B. With more observations and detailed modelling,
the K i resonance doublet may yield a useful age calibra-
tion for very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

4.3. Molecular bands

The main molecular bands in our spectra are labeled in
Figure 2. We measured their strengths using the indices
deﬁned in M99, and we give the values in Table 4. As al-
ready discussed in Kirkpatrick et al. 1999 and M99, the
TiO bands diminish in strength from the late-M to the

Mart´ın et al.

5

L dwarfs, and eventually become undetectable in mid-L
dwarfs. Their dependence on spectral type is shown in
Figure 15. . This eﬀect is understood in terms of the set-
tling of Ti onto dust grains such as CaTiO3, which con-
denses at temperatures below 2500 K (Allard et al. 2001).
The VO molecule behaves in a similar way to the TiO but
it disappears at slightly cooler temperature (Figure 15).
The chromium and iron hydrides become prominent in
mid-L dwarfs, and tend to fade away in the late-L dwarfs
(Figure 15).

The values of the two TiO indices are lower in
GJ 569 Ba than in our dM7.5-dM8 targets, but the VO
indices are more similar. This may be another spectro-
scopic manifestation of low surface gravity. The weakening
of TiO bands may be shifted to later spectral subclass in
low gravity objects because of less eﬃcient dust formation.
It has been noted that dM7-dM9 members of the young
Pleiades cluster have stronger TiO bands than their older
counterparts in the ﬁeld (Mart´ın et al. 1996).

4.4. Comparison of spectral subclasses

In Table 5 we show a comparison of the spectral subclasses
adopted by us in the M99 system with those reported in
the literature. The spectral types given in the literature
correspond to the unresolved systems, and thus are dom-
inated by the primary. There is a fairly good agreement.
No discrepancies larger than 2 subclasses are noted. The
near-infrared spectral types from Geballe et al. (2002) for
two of our binaries also agree within 2 subclasses. The
near-infrared spectral types of Gl 569 Ba and b reported
by Lane et al. (2001) are consistent with our optical spec-
tral types within the uncertainties (half a subclass).

4.5. Absolute magnitude versus spectral type

relationships

Among our sample, only 5 binaries have known parallaxes.
Their properties are summarized in Table 6. In Figure 16
we plot the spectral types of their resolved components
versus the absolute magnitudes in the photometric bands
F 814W and Ks. As expected later type objects are cooler
and have fainter magnitudes. Using second order polyno-
mials, we ﬁnd that the following equations provide a good
ﬁt to our data in the spectral class range dM9 – dL6:

MF 814W = −2.2167 + 2.3284 × SpT − 0.0682 × SpT 2

(1)

MKs = 10.502 − 0.2311 × SpT + 0.0226 × SpT 2

(2)

where we used the numerical code of SpT=9 for M9
through SpT=16 for L6. These ﬁts are shown as dotted
lines in Figure 16. The scatter (1 σ) in relations 1 and 2
over the sample of objects that we ﬁt these relations to
is 0.43 mag. and 0.27 mag., respectively. The good cor-
relation between our adopted spectral types and the ab-
solute magnitudes indicates that the late-M and L dwarf
spectral classiﬁcation scale depends primarily on eﬀective

temperature. The observed scatter around these relations
is likely due to the added contributions of unresolved bina-
rity (higher order multiple systems), observational errors,
gravity eﬀects and metallicity diﬀerences in the sample.
Our results are consistent with those reported by other au-
thors such as Kirkpatrick et al. (2000), Dahn et al. (2002)
and Vrba et al. (2004) within the observational error bars.
A comparison of our SpT – MKs relationship with that of
Vrba et al. (2004) is shown in Figure 16.

5. Summary

We have presented low resolution (R=470) optical spec-
troscopy of 20 ultracool dwarfs in resolved binary systems.
18 targets are members of 9 resolved binaries with angular
separations in the range 0.′′37-0.′′098.

We derived spectral types for our targets using the PC3
index and direct comparison with the M99 ground-based
spectra. We report that the Hα emission in our targets is
statistically weaker than that of ﬁeld dwarfs for the range
of spectral class dM7–dM9.5. We did not detect any ﬂare.
We did not detect the Li i resonance doublet in our targets
because of the poor quality and low resolution of our STIS
spectra. We provide pseudo-equivalent widths of the Cs i
and K i resonance doublets for the targets where those
lines could be measured. These lines tend to increase in
breath and strength toward later spectral types, as already
reported by Kirkpatrick et al. (1999) and M99, but there is
signiﬁcant dispersion which may be due to gravity eﬀects.
This doublet may serve as a useful age indicator for ﬁeld
ultracool dwarfs.

For a subset of 10 targets in 5 binaries with known
trigonometric parallaxes, we show that there is a good
correlation between our spectral types and the absolute
magnitudes of the targets in the F 814W and Ks bands.
We provide second order polynomial ﬁts to the data, which
could be used to derive spectrophotometric parallaxes of
late-M and L ﬁeld dwarfs.

1 MJ deduced from F110M data from Mart´ın et al. 2000.
2 DENIS-P J0205-1159 B is itself likely double (Bouy et al. 2005). Our STIS spectrum and the Ks magnitude of Koerner et al.
1999 include the sum of the two components.

Fig. 1. This ﬁgure shows the PSF ﬁtting to the 2-dimensional STIS spectrum at 743.8 nm for two binary systems,
namely 2MASSW J1311391+803222 (separation = 0.′′263) and GJ 569 B (separation = 0.′′090). The black lines show
the observed proﬁles, the red lines indicate the best PSF ﬁts for the components of these systems, the light blue line
denotes the sum of the best PSF ﬁts, and the green line shows the residuals obtained by substracting the sum of the
PSF ﬁts to the observed proﬁle. The integrated ﬂux of the residuals is about 3% of the integrated ﬂux of the total
PSF.

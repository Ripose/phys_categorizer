Abstract

Preliminary results are presented which suggest that scaling and singu-
larity characteristics of solar wind and ground based magnetic ﬂuctuations
appear to be a signiﬁcant component in the solar wind - magnetosphere in-
teraction processes. Of key importance is the intermittence of the ”magnetic
turbulence” as seen in ground based and solar wind magnetic data. The meth-
ods used in this paper (estimation of ﬂatness and multifractal spectra) are
commonly used in the studies of ﬂuid or MHD turbulence. The results show
that single observatory characteristics of magnetic ﬂuctuations are different
from those of the multi-observatory AE-index. In both data sets, however,
the inﬂuence of the solar wind ﬂuctuations is recognizable. The correlation
between the scaling/singularity features of solar wind magnetic ﬂuctuations
and the corresponding geomagnetic response is demonstrated in a number of
cases. The results are also discussed in terms of patchy reconnection pro-
cesses in magnetopause and forced or/and self-organized criticality (F/SOC)
of internal magnetosphere dynamics.

Introduction

According to recent knowledge magnetospheric plasma ﬂuctuations may be ex-
plained in terms of multiscale intermittent models including nonlinear self-organization
processes (forced or not) near criticality (F/SOC) [Chang(1992), Chang(1999),
Chapman et al.(1998), Takalo et al.(1999), Klimas et al.(2000)]. The basic phys-
ical concepts and the corresponding path-integral and renormalization group for-
malisms of nonlinear self-organization of magnetospheric processes are described
in [Chang(1999)]. These models predict multifractality, non-Gaussian, power-law
distributions for certain measurable physical quantities and associated power-law
scalings for power spectra. In fact, several experimental studies seem to support the
theoretical predictions quite well [Consolini et al.(1996), Milovanov et al.(1996),

Consolini(1997), Borovsky et al.(1997), Consolini and De Michelis(1998), V¨or¨os (1998),
Uritsky and Pudovkin (1998), Consolini and Lui(1999), Chapman et al.(1999), Freeman et al.(2000a),
Freeman et al.(2000b), Sharma et al.(2001)]. Scale-free power spectra of magne-
tospheric ﬂuctuations, however, admit several possible explanations other than
F/SOC. [Watkins et al.(2001a)] compared linear noisy, low-dimensional nonlin-
ear, stochastic fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and SOC models of magneto-
spheric ﬂuctuations to examine their scaling and predictabilitity properties. They
concluded that the SOC model is of particular interest to magnetospheric physics
due to its robustness in explaining scalings under the wide range of activity levels
exhibited by the magnetosphere and the solar wind. On the other hand, weakly
nonlinear models with fBm type noise added could explain the scaling and pre-
dictabitity properties of magnetospheric ﬂuctuations equally well. Geomagnetic
ﬂuctuations on the time scale of substorms and storms certainly appear to be a com-
pound mixture of multiscale magnetospheric processes including the component
represented by intermittent solar wind ﬂuctuations [Chang(1999), Daglis et al.(1999)].
Spectral methods making a distinction between these constituents may be queried
to a certain extent mainly because the information on nonlinear multiscale struc-
tures is partially hidden for second order statistics. For example, [Tsurutani et al.(1990)]
using the AE-index time series have shown that the power spectrum of the AE data
exhibits two different power law scalings divided by a spectral break at the fre-
quency range about 1/(5h). While the higher frequency part was thought to be
more intrinsic to the magnetosphere, the lower frequency part was attributed to the
inﬂuence of solar wind. [V¨or¨os(2000)] has shown that similar results can be ob-
tained also by means of a multifractal technique, which also makes possible, how-
ever, to reveal additional information on singularity distributions of high-latitude
geomagnetic ﬂuctuations (see later), not evident from spectral studies. Among
other things, the results of multifractal analysis show that the local singularity
(H¨older) exponents are time dependent and the previously proposed fBm type or
bicolored noise model [Takalo et al.(1993)] of geomagnetic ﬂuctuations is not rel-
evant. Moreover, for a range of singularity exponents, a multiplicative cascade
model, (the P -model) describes quite well the observed singularity distribution
of geomagnetic ﬂuctuations. Out of this range, however, signiﬁcant deviations
from a multiplicative model appear. The P -model describes energy cascade pro-
cesses in turbulent ﬂows. The largest turbulent eddy is assumed to be built up by
a speciﬁc energy ﬂux per unit length. Then a scale-independent space-averaged
cascade-rate is considered and the ﬂux density is transferred to the two smaller
eddies with the same length but different ﬂux probabilities p1 and p2. This pro-
cess with randomly distributed p1 and p2 (p1 + p2 = 1) is repeated towards smaller
and smaller scales. Energy transfer rate is homogeneous for p = p1 = p2 = 0.5
while p1 > 0.5 corresponds to an intermittent ﬂow. Figure 1 shows how the inter-

2

mittence increases with increasing parameter p1 [Tu et al.(1996)] in α, f (α) plane
[Halsey et al.(1986)]. The larger spread of α values around right-shifted ¯α, the
more intermittent ﬁeld. In spite of the simplicity of the outlined cascade model its
relevance for the description of intermittence effects in magnetospheric ﬂuctuations
may lead to the assumption that turbulence rather than F/SOC models ﬁt the ob-
served statistics better. Some results on statistical distribution of internal time peri-
ods between bursty geomagnetic events (waiting times) [Kov´acs et al.(2001)] seem
to support this assumption. SOC models (at least the original [Bak et al.(1987)]
model) are expected to display an exponential waiting time distribution. Geo-
magnetic data, however, display a well-deﬁned power-law waiting time distri-
It was pointed out by [Boffetta et al.(1999)] that the observed power-
bution.
law waiting time statistics in solar ﬂares appears to be well explained by MHD
shell models of turbulence. Similar results were presented by [Spada et al.(2001)]
who analysed density ﬂuctuations in a magnetically conﬁned plasma system and
found that waiting time statistics is in contrast with the predictions of an SOC
system. An opposite view was presented by [Freeman et al.(2000b)] who con-
jectured that a wider class of running sandpile models [Hwa and Kardar(1992)]
could exhibit power law behaviour in the probability density functions of wait-
ing times. [Watkins et al.(2001b)] determined that the PDFs for burst durations
and waiting times in a reduced MHD simulation follow power-laws which is not
sufﬁcient to distinguish between turbulence, SOC-like models and colored noise
sources.
[Boffetta et al.(1999)] and [Antoni et al.(2001)] also argued that SOC
models represent self-similar, fractal phenomena. Geomagnetic ﬂuctuations ex-
hibit clear multifractal scaling [Consolini et al.(1996), V¨or¨os(2000)] which seems
to contradict to SOC concepts again. [Georgoulis et al.(1995)], however, demon-
strated that the SOC state displayed by their cellular automaton model of isotropic
and anisotropic energy avalanches has multifractal and multiscaling characteris-
tics, rather than single power-law scalings and this feature was even enhanced by
considering extended instability criteria. Similar SOC models of solar ﬂares also
exhibit multifractal and multiscaling characteristics [Vlahos et al.(1995)]. Recent
works [Vassiliadis et al.(1998), Isliker et al.(1998), Isliker et al.(2000), Georgoulis et al.(2001),
Uritsky et al.(2001)] underline the proximity between the SOC rules and laws of
MHD in space physics systems, which are long known to exhibit turbulent be-
haviour (Georgoulis, personal communication, 2001). More realistic F/SOC mod-
els which include e.g. less artiﬁcial feedback mechanisms, a wide variety of driv-
ings, interacting avalanches, SOC in continuum physical systems [Lu (1995)], etc.
may further establish the proximity with turbulence. As pointed out by [Uritsky et al.(2001),
?] the concept of SOC in a continuum limit (ﬂuid or MHD limit) is essentially un-
explored. [Klimas et al.(2000)] proposed a simpliﬁed Earth’s magnetotail current
sheet model based on continuum SOC model of [Lu (1995)]. The continuum Lu

3

model in a magnetic ﬁeld reversal conﬁguration can evolve into SOC due to local-
ized rapid magnetic ﬁeld annihilation within the ﬁeld reversal region. In the same
time, the plasma sheet is dominated by strong turbulence which keeps the system
near criticality and produces a predictable quasi-periodic loading-unloading cycle
of coherent global substorm activity [Klimas et al.(2000)]. In this model turbu-
lence, SOC states and coherent global modes coexist within the Earth’s magnetotail
on different scales. As a result, the observed ground based and satellite time-series
contain a mix of ﬂuctuations of different physical origin. [Angelopoulos et al.(1999)]
further argued that the presence of intermittent turbulence in the Earth’s magneto-
tail may alter the conductivity and the mass/momentum diffusion properties across
the plasma sheet and may permit cross-scale coupling processes playing also an
important role in the establishment of SOC state.

In this paper no attempt will be made to participate in the theoretical debate on
SOC or turbulence. However, having a pragmatic view, our opinion is that mea-
sures of intermittence or characteristic descriptors of cascade processes, commonly
used in turbulence studies, like the ﬂatness and multifractal spectra, could be ap-
plied in solar wind-magnetosphere interaction studies for further comparison of
basic characteristics of intermittent ﬂuctuations in solar wind and within the mag-
netosphere. We assume this aproach might be useful providing experimental infor-
mation on such characteristics of ﬂuctuations which are not accessible for spectral
studies or second order statistics. This assumption was already investigated in
[V¨or¨os (1998), V¨or¨os(2000), V¨or¨os and Kov´acs(2001), Kov´acs et al.(2001)]. The
preliminary results allow to make a working hypothesis that intermittence, scaling,
rapid changes, singularities represent an essential piece of information regarding
the effectiveness of SW - magnetosphere coupling not considered enough hitherto.
In order to go deeper, we analyse different geomagnetic and solar wind data sets
and make a comparison between various magnetic activity levels considering time
scales of geomagnetic storms (from hours to days), substorms (from half an hour
to a few hours) or less.

The main goal of this comparative study is to contribute to the understanding
of solar wind - magnetosphere interaction processes on the basis of characteris-
tic scaling/singularity features of the considered time series. We recall that solar
wind (SW) ﬂuctuations are strongly intermittent [Burlaga(1991)], that is energy
at a given scale is not homogeneously distributed in space or/and time. Several
studies on characteristic probability distribution functions (PDF) of increments
of SW parameters (magnetic ﬁeld, velocity, temperature, Els¨asser variable, etc.)
[Marsch and Tu(1994), Sorriso-Valvo et al.(1999)] and on multifractal structure of
SW ﬂuctuations [Burlaga(1992), Carbone(1994), Marsch et al.(1996), Tu et al.(1996)]
support this assumption. Moreover, [Veltri and Mangeney(1999)] and [Bruno et al.(1999)]
have shown that there is a direct link between intermittence and the presence of SW

4

structures (Alfv´enic, magnetic ﬂuctuations, discontinuities) across which the mag-
netic ﬁeld magnitude changes. Also, the high frequency (small scale) ﬂuctuations
of the southward component of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld have a different
spectral scaling exponent as the one exhibited by geomagnetic AE index ﬂuctua-
tions. On larger scales the corresponding spectra are similar [Tsurutani et al.(1990)].
A comparative study of dynamical critical scalings in the auroral electrojet (AE)
index versus solar wind ﬂuctuations conﬁrmed that for times shorter than 3.5 hours
(higher frequencies) the AE index ﬂuctuations are of internal magnetospheric ori-
gin [Uritsky et al.(2001)].

2 Data analysis methods

As usual, we introduce the concept of scale (τ ) through the difference

δX(t, τ ) = X(t + τ ) − X(t)

(1)

where X(t) is the time series under consideration. [Marsch and Tu(1994)] have
shown that the PDFs of the increments δX (X - SW parameters) exhibit strong
deviations from Gaussianity, especially at smaller scales and the effect is due to
intermittence of SW ﬂuctuations. To quantify the degree of deviation from the
Gaussian distribution, i.e. the level of intermittence at different scales, we compute
the ﬂatness deﬁned by

F =

< δX(t, τ )4 >
< δX(t, τ )2 >2

The ﬂatness of a normally distributed signal is equal 3. Adding intermittent ﬂuc-
tuations to an originally Gaussian signal implies the spreading of its PDF, and
consequently, the increase of its ﬂatness from the original value of 3.

Non-homogeneous/intermittent distributions in space/time may also appear as
asymptotically singular and can be characterized locally, at the point ti, by the sin-
gularity (H¨older) exponents α as [V´ehel(1996), V´ehel and Vojak(1998), Riedi(1995),
Canus(1998)]

where µ is a measure constructed from a time series. The procedure involvs the
computation of the energy content of the differenced signal (Eq. 1) by taking its
squared value. The measure at a point ti is given by δX 2(ti, τ )/ Pi δX 2(ti, τ ). To
analyse the distribution of singularity exponents (Eq. 3) a sequence of partitions P
is introduced so that [V´ehel(1996)]

where I k
n is the interval containing t and the resolution is set by n. The quantity
of interest is the so-called large deviation singularity spectrum, f (α), which repre-
sents a rate function measuring the deviation of the observed α from the expected
value α. The rate function, f (α), can be estimated through [V´ehel(1996)] :

”histogram methods” for estimation of f (α) are used. In that case the number of
those intervals I k

and f (α) is found by a regression.
It yields satisfactory results for pure multi-
plicative processes, but fails to describe non pure or compound processes when
f (α) is not a concave function. To overcome this difﬁculty the so-called double
kernel method was proposed [V´ehel(1996), V´ehel and Vojak(1998)] realizing that
Nn(α) may be written as a convolution of the density of the αk
ns and a compactly
supported kernel. This method allows to estimate non concave rate functions and
we are going to show that this property may be properly used for characteriza-
tion of ﬂuctuation processes in near-Earth space. In this paper the estimations of
f (α) spectra were realized using the FRACLAB package developed at the Institut
National de Recherche en Informatique, Le Chesnay, France.

3 Ground based data

In order to study the basic characteristics of auroral zone geomagnetic ﬂuctuations
we analyse geomagnetic H-component 1-min mean data from polar cap obser-
vatory, THULE (THL: 77.47o N, 290.77o E), geomagnetic X-component 1-min
mean data from high-latitude observatory NARSSARSSUAQ (NAQ: 61.16o N,
314.57o E) and 1-min mean auroral electrojet (AE) index time series, all from
1991-1992.

As known, the AE-index was introduced by [Davis and Sugiura(1966)] to de-
scribe the global activity of the auroral zone electric currents and is derived, after
the substraction of base line values, from evaluation of the variations measured at
12 stations located near the northern auroral zone. There exist a large number of
physical mechanisms which couple the auroral zone processes with those within
magnetospheric tail or in SW. Recently, intermittent energy transport in the mag-
netotail, the so called bursty bulk ﬂow events (BBF) came into the limelight of the
magnetosphere research [Baumjohann(1990), Angelopoulos et al.(1992)]. From
this point of view the understanding of the response of auroral zone currents or

6

dissipation ﬁelds to the time - varying magnetotail dynamics seems to be impor-
tant. There was not full understanding achieved regarding the nature and origin
of the related magnetic ﬂuctuations. Partly it was already explained in the intro-
duction that it is related to the paradigms of F/SOC versus turbulence. We men-
tion here some other open questions. For example it was shown that the burst
lifetime distributions of some SW parameters are also of power law form, which
might be a signature of SOC or turbulence regimes in SW [Freeman et al.(2000a),
Kov´acs and V¨or¨os (2001)]. Therefore, it is supposed that the scale free property
of the AE-index may arise from the SW input or at least the internal dynamics
of the magnetosphere may be masked by the scale free properties of SW driver
[Freeman et al.(2000a)]. Again we remind, however, the very limitations of sec-
ond order statistics in interpretation of the observed scalings. Another measure of
the auroral zone dissipation ﬁelds is represented by polar optical activity within
UVI bands. [Lui et al.(2000)] have examined the blobs of brightness as a proxy
for BBF events. It was found that the non-substorm ”internal” events have a power
law distribution whereas the system wide events like substorms besides a scale free
region exhibit a ”bump”, corresponding to a mean value in substorm breakups. A
somewhat opposite view was presented by [Consolini and De Michelis(1998)] who
analysed AE-index ﬂuctuations on time scales 1-120 [min] both in quiet (laminar
phase) and disturbed periods (turbulent phase). They found that in both phases
the intermittence at different time scales rescales in the same way and the non-
Gaussian character of PDFs seems to be due to the same physical processes.

Here we pose the question again about the scaling and singularity proper-
ties of the AE-index, compared to the similar characteristics of geomagnetic data
from two observatories THL and NAQ. As the AE index is derived from geo-
magnetic variations in the horizontal component observed at selected observatories
along the auroral zone in the northern hemisphere, we expect that the scale τ (Eq.
1) cannot be precisely deﬁned. The geographic distance between observatories
through Taylor’s hypothesis already introduces some effective time shift (scale, τ ).
Though, the application of the Taylor hypothesis within the magnetosphere is lim-
ited [Dudok de Wit and Krasnoselskikh (1990)]. Besides, from the recordings of
auroral stations the greatest (upper envelope) and smallest (lower envelope) values
are taken at intervals of one minute and their difference deﬁnes the AE-index. As
far as the contributing observatory which gives the lower/upper envelope changes
during the times, and the ﬂuctuations with values between the upper and lower
envelopes are not taken into account at all (smoothing), the AE-index appears to
be a measure of auroral zone processes with mixed scales. This is certainly not
an advantage when a multiscale analysis of AE-index time series is performed.
This fact is usually neglected in the related literature. A less sophisticated way
is to take data from a single observatory, but it may have some other drawbacks

7

because signiﬁcant distant disturbance events can be missed. Also, some BBFs
with short duration may remain undetected on the ground because of their local-
ized nature [Daglis et al.(1999)]. Nevertheless, a comparison of ﬂuctuations of the
”multi-observatory measure” (MOM: AE-index) and of the ”single observatory
measure” (SOM: THL geomagnetic ﬁeld H-component and NAQ geomagnetic
ﬁeld X-component) may be instructive.

Figure 2 shows the PDFs from normalized increments δX (Eq.1) of the SOM
(Figure 1a, b) and MOM (Figure 1b) data (X ≡ X(NAQ), H(THL) and AE, re-
spectively). Calculations have been made for τ = 5, 50, 500, 5000 [min] and 1
minute mean data was considered from the years 1991-1992. As can be seen the
distributions in all cases change with τ , and for smaller values of τ signiﬁcant de-
viations from the normal distribution occur. The tails of the distributions reduce
with increasing scale parameter as a consequence of the decrease of the probabil-
ity of coherent ﬂuctuations between points separated by increasing distance. The
difference between the MOM and SOM is more clear if the ﬂatness (F ) of the
corresponding distributions is compared (Eq. 2). Figure 3 shows how the ﬂat-
ness evolves with increasing τ (τ ∈ (5, 5000) [min]). The errorbars correspond to
the standard deviations (std) computed from time series divided to several parts.
For small scales, say, τ less than a few tens of minutes, the AE-index (MOM) ex-
hibits smaller deviations from the normal distribution than NAQ (SOM). F (N AQ)
reaches the level of Fmax (AE, τ = 5) only at the value τ ∼ 30 [min], which roughly
may be considered as the effective time shift introduced by the method of deriva-
tion of the AE-index. THL (polar cap observatory) data essentially show the same
behaviour as NAQ, but the stds are larger. Therefore, we conjecture that MOMs
(multi-observatory geomagnetic indices), due to smoothing and scale mixing ef-
fects, lead to underestimation of the intermittence on small scales. Henceforth, we
will show only the dependence of the ﬂatness on scale parameter τ .

Let us consider now the singularity distributions f (α) (Eq. 3, 4) for the same
data sets as above. To see better how the f (α) rate functions evolve with τ , all the
curves are depicted at the same plane (α, f (α)) in Figure 4. Proper symbols are
introduced for the scales τ = 10, 50, 500 [min] (△, ∗, o) and the dashed lines corre-
spond to the errors estimated by changing the resolution in Eq. 3, 4. (No averaging
needs to be done estimating f (α) [V´ehel(1996)] so the spectrum may be evaluated
at only one resolution. However, to show that the estimations are consistent, all the
spectra were computed using 15 different resolutions). Again, there are several dif-
ferencies between the SOM and MOM data. Figure 4a shows the singularity spec-
tra for NAQ observatory data. On the considered scales, the shape of the curves
is almost parabolic, close to the P -model ﬁt (thick curve) with p1 ∼ 0.745. The
best correspondence is achieved for the smallest value of τ = 10 [min] (depicted by
symbol △ on Figure 4a). It means that in case of auroral zone SOM ﬂuctuations

8

and especially on small scales, the deviations from the Gaussian distribution (Fig-
ure 3) can be explained by a simple cascade model. Though the phenomenology
of turbulent cascades in ﬂuid ﬂows is more complex than the simple P -model ﬁt in
Figure 4a would lead us to indicate, the 1D cascade model rouhgly describes how
the auroral zone SOM ﬂuctuations become more and more intermittent at smaller
and smaller scales. The spectra for polar cap (THL observatory) SOM (Figure 4b)
and AE index MOM (Figure 4c) have a more pronounced non-parabolic shape indi-
cating the presence of compound processes. At small scales (τ = 5,50 [min]) THL
observatory ﬂuctuations contain stronger singularities because of the extension of
the rate functions left wings to the smaller (more singular) values of α. For τ =
500 [min], however, the right wing evolves to the less singular values which may
be related to the SW inﬂuence [V¨or¨os(2000)]. This effect is less visible, but still
present in auroral zone SOM data (Figure 4a). The MOM AE index f (α) spectra
practically do not change with τ . We conjecture, this is the result of the method of
derivation of the AE index, resulting smoothing and scale mixing effects.

In all cases, the deviations of singularity spectra from the parabolic shape may
be indicative of the phenomenon of phase transition. Namely, at the α values where
the f (α) spectra are out of parabolic shape the major contributor to the observed
singularities may change from one measure to another. As different physical pro-
cesses may generate different measures (distributions), possible models with simi-
lar characteristics as the observed spectra may contain physical information on the
contributing (e.g. SW or magnetospheric) sources.

4 Satellite data

The very advantage of the ground based data is its availability for a long periods of
time. For a proper estimation of PDFs or singularity rate functions long data sets
are needed which is a requirement hardly ever fulﬁlled in the case of satellite data.
Nevertheless, we expect to ﬁnd out some interesting scaling/singularity features of
interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) ﬂuctuations proceeding in the same way as in
the previous section. To this end we analyse ACE and WIND IMF B magnitude
and Bz component data which are available with time resolution of 16 [s] and
3 [s], respectively. SW velocity is not considered here due to too many gaps in
data. While the ACE satellite is continuously monitoring the SW at the L1 point,
WIND has a more complicated trajectory crossing also the magnetosphere from
time to time. For our analysis we have chosen time periods when WIND was also
in SW and there were negligible data gaps in both cases (less than 1 % of total data
lengths).

Another aim was to analyse ”geoeffectively different” periods of IMF B and

9

Bz magnitude ﬂuctuations. Geoeffectiveness during the chosen periods was con-
sidered examining the geomagnetic Dst index which is derived from the geomag-
netic ﬁeld H-component registrations of 4 observatories [Sugiura(1964)] and it
aims at giving the effect of the magnetospheric ring currents. The chosen peri-
ods were classiﬁed as disturbed ones if geomagnetic ﬂuctuations with storm-index
Dst being less than -50 [nT] occured several times within a consedered interval.
The limit of Dst < -100 [nT] which corresponds to intense storms was con-
sidered, too. We emphasize, however, instead of a study of individual storms,
the generic features of ﬂuctuations on a given scale τ , but during longer periods
of time are investigated. Essentially 2 ÷ 4 weeks of data with the consedered
time resolutions may already ensure sufﬁciently robust estimations of singular-
ity spectra (Eq. 4).
In this sense, several intense magnetic storms Dst ≪ -50
[nT] may occur during a strongly disturbed interval, a less disturbed period con-
tains less intense storms and an undisturbed period has only Dst > -50 [nT]. The
limit of -50 [nT] was chosen on the basis of previous studies of magnetic storms
[Taylor et al.(1996)]. Intense magnetic storms are characterised by Dst index <
-100 [nT] [Gonzalez and Tsurutani(1987)]. In this preliminary study of generic
features of magnetic ﬂuctuations these limits may be consedered as more or less
adequate. We expect that this rough classiﬁcation of the geomagnetic response al-
lows us to identify characteristic scaling and singularity features of the correspond-
ing IMF magnetic ﬂuctuations that would be indicative for their geoeffectiveness.
There were 5 time periods and 6 data sets separated for our analysis (for one
period there were both ACE and WIND data available). The disturbed periods
are the following: 1. March 19 - April 25, 2001 (ACE); 2. October 1 - November
30, 2000 (ACE); 3. April 9 - April 20, 1997 (WIND). The undisturbed periods: 4.
November 18 - December 10, 1998 (ACE); 5. January 10 - January 29, 1998 (ACE,
WIND). For demonstration we show some of the data sets.

Figure 5 shows the ﬁrst ACE data set from March 19 to April 25, 2001. For
the sake of perspicuity, the time resolution is 1 [h]. (The ﬂatness and singularity
spectra are computed from the time series with time resolution of 16 [s] and 3 [s].)
During this extremely active period intense magnetic storms (Dst ≤ -100 [nT])
occured several times (Figure 5c). The limit of -100 [nT] is depicted by a thick line
in Figure 5c. [Gonzalez and Tsurutani(1987)] have shown that the interplanetary
causes of intense magnetic storms are long duration (> 3 [h]), large and negative
(< -10 [nT]) IMF Bz events associated with interplanetary duskward electric ﬁelds
> 5 [mV m−1]. In Figure 5b IMF Bz is depicted, including a thick line indicating
the level of -10 [nT]. Comparison of Figures 5b, c shows an agreement with the
above criteria, that is, long duration negative IMF Bz events occur together with
intense magnetic storms. Figure 5a shows the variations of IMF B. It is visible
that an intense magnetic storm occured at the end of the studied period, between

10

t = 800 and 900 [h] (Figure 5c). Bz < 10 [nT] (Figure 5b) and Bmax ∼ 17 [nT]
corresponded to this event. A similar enhancement of B at 400 [h] ≤ t < 450
[h] appears in Figure 5a having no intense storm response in Dst, which can be
explained by the corresponding IMF Bz > -10 [nT] in Figure 5b.

Figure 6 shows an undisturbed period from January 10 to January 29, 1998.
Again, IMF B, Bz (WIND, ACE Figures 6a-d) and Dst index (Figure 6e) are
shown. It is visible that Dst > -50 [nT] and Bz > -10 [nT] everywhere.

Fluctuations of IMF and their geoeffectiveness were studied by a number of
authors. [McPherron et al.(1986)] showed that substorms are frequently triggered
by changes in the IMF. [Kamide(2001)] proposed that the quasi-steady compo-
nent of the interplanetary electric ﬁeld is imporant in enhancing the ring current,
while its ﬂuctuations are responsible for initiating magneospheric substorms.
It
is out of scope of this paper to analyse the inﬂuence of other interplanetary pa-
rameters (e.g. velocity, density, temperature, etc.) on storm/ substorm activity
[Daglis et al.(2001)]. Rather we will concentrate on the level of intermittence of
IMF ﬂuctuations.

To this end let us consider the ﬂatnesses and the singularity rate functions for
the disturbed and undisturbed periods of 1 − 5. Deviations from the Gaussian
distribution are larger in the case of disturbed events depicted by larger markersizes
in Figure 7. The PDFs of the undisturbed events are also non-Gaussian, but the
ﬂatnesses for a given scale are smaller than those for disturbed events especially at
scales τ < 1000 [s]. Similar differences are present in singularity spectra computed
for IMF B ﬂuctuations at the scales of τ = 320 [sec] (ACE) and τ = 60 [s] (WIND)
shown in Figure 8. There were the same marker types used as in Figure 7. ACE and
WIND data are depicted separately in Figures 8a, b. The maxima of the singularity
spectra of more disturbed periods have a tendency for shifting to larger values of
α. Also, the spread of singularities around most probable α is wider for more
disturbed cases. But it is the same behaviour as in case of the simple P -model in
Figure 1, when intermittence is stronger and stronger for larger and larger values of
p1. The differences between the disturbed and undisturbed cases gradually cease
for larger values of τ (not shown).

Figure 9 shows the singularity spectra computed for IMF Bz ﬂuctuations in
the same way as previously. Obviously, the intermittent ﬂuctuations of IMF B and
Bz ﬁelds exhibit very similar changes in their ﬂatnesses and singularity spectra as
the geoeffectivity level changes. For example, there is a clear difference between
the introduced scaling and singularity characteristics (Figure 5) for the disturbed
period March 19 - April 25, 2001 and for the undisturbed period January 10 -
January 29, 1998 (Figure 6). It indicates that, in addition to known ”geoeffective”
SW parameters (e.g. southward component of IMF) or their combinations, small
scale rapid changes, singularities and non-Gaussian statistics of IMF ﬂuctuations

11

may play an important role in SW - magnetosphere interaction processes.

Also, the question naturally arises to what extent the magnetospheric response
itself is inﬂuenced by small scale statistics of IMF ﬂuctuations. Unfortunately, not
all the geomagnetic data is available for the above analysed periods. It is possi-
ble to test, however, how the shape of the rate function changes if available data
is considered. Minute-mean H-component geomagnetic data from THL observa-
tory is available from 1975 to 1996. We computed the f (α) spectra for each year
at the scale τ = 50 [min] and analysed how their shapes change at the f (α) val-
ues 0.3 - 0.9. At each level of f (α) the corresponding values of αmin and αmax
were computed (ﬁlled circles in Figure 10a).
In Figure 10b the time evolution
of the difference αmax − αmin at a given f (α) level is depicted. The average
standard deviation at f (α) = 0.3 is about 0.06, while at f (α) = 0.9 is 0.02. At
f (α) = 0.3 - 0.6 the αmax − αmin curves strongly ﬂuctuate indicating signiﬁcant
changes in the shape of f (α) spectra from 1975 to 1996. Figure 11 shows the
similar results of [Kamide et al.(1998)], however, obtained by a different method.
[Kamide et al.(1998)] analysed the occurence of geomagnetic storms in compari-
son with yearly averaged Wolf sunspot number. Figure 11 shows the yearly aver-
aged number of hours with Dst less than -100 [nT] (solid line with ﬁlled diamonds),
and with Dst less than -50 [nT] (divided by 5, dashed line). Thick line corresponds
to yearly averaged sunspot number. It is visible that the maxima of geomagnetic
activity and of solar cycle do not coincide. During the declining phase of the so-
lar cycle coronal holes emerge from polar regions of the Sun which are continuous
sources of fast-speed plasma causing a peak in recurrent geomagnetic storms activ-
ity [Kamide et al.(1998), Kamide(2001)]. The similarity between the variability of
rate function shapes for f (α) = 0.3 ÷ 0.6 (Figure 10b) and yearly averaged number
of hours with prescribed Dst indices (Figure 11) is remarkable. This correspon-
dence also supports our working assumption that the shape of f (α) rate function
estimated using Eqs. 3, 4 [V´ehel(1996), V´ehel and Vojak(1998)] contains relevant
physical information. We mention that available AE-index and NAQ observatory
data lead to the same results. On the other hand, however, at f (α) = 0.7 - 0.9 the
variations of αmax − αmin versus time are negligible (Figure 10b).

On the basis of Figures 10b and 11, years with extreme levels of geomagnetic
response can be chosen and their corresponding singularity spectra can be recalcu-
lated. Figures 12a-c show the SOM and MOM spectra estimated at τ = 50 [min]
for maximum (1991, symbol o) and minimum (1984 - symbol x) years of geomag-
netic activity. One can see that the characteristic asymmetric shape of AE-index
spectra (Figure 12c) in comparison with Figure 4c is present henceforward, pre-
sumably caused by the inﬂuence of SW ﬂuctuations. Noticeably, the maxima and
the right wings of the more geoeffective SW IMF singularity distributions (Figures
8, 9) match well the region of α ∈ (1.2, 1.8) within which the MOM spectra for

12

the most part are out of parabolic shapes. The same effect is visible for the more
singular wing of f (α) spectra at α ∈ (0.4, 0.8). The asymmetry is even enhanced
in 1991 (maximum of geomagnetic activity). The differences between more active
(1991) and less active (1984) years are present in SOM spectra mainly at the wings
of f (α) rate function, too (Figures 12a, b). The most probable singularities around
¯α do not exhibit any changes.

5 Discussion

We presented an analysis of scaling and singularity characteristics of ground based
and satellite magnetic ﬂuctuations in this paper. These techniques are commonly
used in studies of turbulent ﬂows. As we oulined in the Introduction the sup-
posed proximity between F/SOC and MHD turbulence models may allow to esti-
mate measures of scaling, intermittence, etc., directly from time series, for futrher
comparison aiming to help a development of tractable numerical models of highly
variable SW - magnetosphere interaction (Georgoulis, personal communication,
2001). We think the results are not contradictory in this sense, but rather eluci-
date important aspects of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations which should be incorporated
to more realistic F/SOC models of SW driven magnetospheric activity. Scaling
and singularity characteristics of high-quality geomagnetic data from THULE and
NARSSARSSUAQ observatories (Single Observatory Measures) and of AE-index
(Multi Observatory Measure) were compared estimating PDFs, ﬂatnesses and sin-
gularity rate functions. The same methods were applied for ACE and WIND data.
The speciﬁc periods chosen for the analysis of SW ﬂuctuations reﬂect the limited
availability of high resolution satellite data for relatively longer periods of time. In
spite of this, subgroups of disturbed and undisturbed periods were selected, having
primarily in mind the occurence of enhanced geomagnetic response represented
by 1-hour mean Dst-index. The comparison of generic features of ﬂuctuations in
SW and high-latitude SOM and MOM data is then possible, because geomagnetic
activity at high-latitudes is always very high during magnetic storms, though the
storm/substorm relationship itself is more complicated [Daglis et al.(2001)].

It was shown that the intermittence of AE-index ﬂuctuations is reduced at small
scales due to the method of its derivation. We argue this also provides a possible
explanation for the negligible changes of the AE-index singularity distribution with
τ . Other kind of MOM data might be inﬂuenced in the same way. Nevertheless,
the contribution of SW ﬂuctuations make the AE-index rate function asymmetric,
mainly within the range of α ∈ (1.2, 1.8). The same asymmetry caused by the SW
is also present in THL and NAQ rate functions, however, mainly for τ > 300 [min]
(see also [V¨or¨os(2000)]).

13

In case of SW ﬂuctuations it was demonstrated that the departure from Gaus-
sianity is stronger at small scales and it clearly depends on the correlation (geo-
effectiveness) between IMF ﬂuctuations and the occurence of geomagnetic storms
(decreased Dst-index). It seems to indicate that the intermittence strength of IMF
magnitude and Bz component ﬂuctuations, in addition to other SW parameters
such as southward Bz, SW velocity, density, Alfvenic Mach number, plasma β,
represents a new parameter (or rather a whole set of parameters describing singu-
larity features) controlling the energy input rate to the magnetosphere. Considering
Taylor’s hypothesis and SW velocities of 500 km/s, intermittence at time scales of
tens of seconds corresponds to the spatial structures of several thousand kilome-
ters or more. [Book and Sibeck(1995)] estimated the corresponding timescale on
which turbulent motion may affect the transport of mass and energy across the
magnetopause through interchange instability. They have found it is less than 150
[s]. As known from previous ISEE1 and 2 magnetometer studies dayside recon-
nection of IMF and GMF lines seems often to be a sporadic and patchy process
and measurements obtained at and near the magnetopause indicate that reconnec-
tion does not necessarily occur across the all dayside magnetopause even under
the favourable southward pointing IMF conditions [Rijnbeek et al.(1984)]. We
conjecture, patchy reconnection may be related to intermittence and singularity
characteristics of IMF turbulence at small scales. There is a number of works in
which the role of turbulence in magnetopause reconnection processes is anticipated
[Galeev et al.(1986), Drake et al.(1994), Kuznetsova and Roth(1995)]. We recall
the work of [Galeev et al.(1986)] in which patchy reconnection was considered to
be an irregular multiscale process associated with the magnetic ﬁeld diffusion and
self-consistently generated magnetic turbulence. Our results indicate that a num-
ber of singularity parameters (H¨older exponents) should be taken into account to
properly describe the basic characteristics of the upstream SW turbulence. In this
paper we examined the global distribution of IMF singularities and found clear
differences between geoeffectively disturbed and undisturbed periods. Obviously,
to understand better the role of turbulence in patchy magnetopause reconnection
processes a proper time and space localization of IMF singularities will be needed.

have suggested that global singularity spectra estimations of SOM and MOM data
sets on different scales may allow to separate ﬂuctuations of SW or magnetospheric
origin. Our results show that the inﬂuence of the SW is perceptible mainly at the
wings of the rate function, that is at smaller values of f (α). The most probable
singularities (f (α) = 0.8 − 1) are less inﬂuenced by SW driver. Rate functions
estimated for years 1975-1996 exhibit similar variations as geomagnetic activity
studied by [Kamide et al.(1998)]. SW forcing effects were found when SOM and
MOM singularity spectra for two years (1984 and 1991) of different geomagnetic

14

As far as the magnetospheric response is considered, previous results [V¨or¨os and Kov´acs(2001)]

activity levels were compared.

We believe that further development in this direction will result a better under-
standing of SW - magnetosphere interaction allowing more efﬁcient prediction of
space weather.

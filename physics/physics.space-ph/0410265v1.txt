Abstract

The curvature of spacetime has interesting consequences for plane wave propagation
in a vacuum. The propagation of plane waves with phase velocity directed opposite
to the the time–averaged Poynting vector is investigated for a general Riemannian
metric. Conditions for such negative phase velocity (NPV) propagation are established
in terms of the metric components. In particular, we demonstrate that a gyrotropic–
like magnetoelectric component is required to support NPV propagation. The negative
energy density implications of NPV propagation are discussed.

Keywords: General theory of relativity; negative refraction; negative energy density; plane
wave propagation.

1 Introduction

Negative refraction of a plane wave at the planar interface of two linear, isotropic, homoge-
neous materials is said to occur when the projections of the real parts of the wave vectors

of the incident and the refracted plane waves on the interface normal are oppositely di-
rected. Then the real part of the wave vector and the time–averaged Poynting vector are
parallel in one material, but antiparallel in the other [1]. We call the latter kinds as negative-
phase–velocity (NPV) materials, but at least two other names have common currency too:
left–handed materials, and negative–index materials. In order to extend the phenomenon of
negative refraction to anisotropic materials, NPV materials are characterized by the nega-
tivity of the projection of the real part of the wave vector on the time–averaged Poynting
vector.

Since the beginning of the year 2000 [2], NPV materials have excited much theoreti-
cal as well as experimental interest. Initial disbelief and criticism in some sections of the
electromagnetics research community [3, 4] eventually gave way to widespread, but perhaps
still not universal, acceptance of NPV materials with unequivocal demonstrations by several
independent groups [5]–[7]. A simplistic expression of the (monochromatic) electromagnetic
energy density turns out to yield negative values [8], which are generally held as impossible
in the electromagnetics research community, but more sophisticated investigations indicate
that the electromagnetic energy density in NPV materials is indeed positive when account
is taken of the frequency–dependent constitutive properties [9].

Perhaps the potentially most useful application of NPV materials is for the so–called
perfect lenses [10]. Once satisfactorily designed and fabricated, such lenses – although not
really perfect [11, 12] — could ﬁnd widespread use in modern optics, for communications,
entertainment, and data storage and retrieval. More uses would emerge with ongoing re-
search on anisotropic NPV materials, particularly with negligibly small dissipation in certain
frequency ranges.

Instead of concentrating on devices, we turned our attention to the marriage of the special
and the general theories of relativity (STR and GTR) and NPV propagation of electromag-
netic ﬁelds. We found, a few months ago, that materials that appear to be of the non-NPV
type to relatively stationary observers can appear to be of the NPV type to observers moving
with uniform velocity [13]. That result permitted us to envisage STR negative refraction
being exploited in astronomical scenarios [14] such as for the remote sensing of planetary
and asteroidal surfaces from space stations. Application to remotely guided, extraterrestrial
mining and manufacturing industries can also be envisioned. Furthermore, many unusual as-
tronomical phenomenons would be discovered and/or explained via STR negative refraction
to interpret data collected via telescopes.

Ordinary vacuum (i.e., matter–free space) appears the same to all observers moving at
constant relative velocities. Therefore, NPV propagation in vacuum cannot be observed by
such observers. This could lead one to believe that NPV propagation is impossible in huge
expanses of interstellar space. However, gravitational ﬁelds from nearby massive objects will
certainly distort electromagnetic propagation, which is a principal tenet of the GTR and
is indeed used nowadays in GPS systems, so that NPV propagation under the inﬂuence of
a gravitational ﬁeld required investigation.
In a short communication [15], we derived a
condition for NPV propagation to occur along a speciﬁc direction in a region of spacetime,
with the assumption of a piecewise uniform but otherwise general spacetime metric. As the

2

consequences of such a possibility are highly relevant to further exploration of outer space
as well as for industrial operations therein, we undertook a more general study, the results
of which are being reported here.

The plan of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, electromagnetism in curved spacetime
is transformed from a covariant to a noncovariant formalism, wherein vacuum resembles a
bianisotropic “medium” wherein planewave propagation can be examined using standard
techniques. A piecewise uniform approximation of the spacetime metric is then undertaken
in Section 3, wherein a condition for NPV propagation is derived. Section 4 is devoted to a
discussion of energy density, and the paper concludes with a summary in Section 5.

standard generalization (1) in the absence of experimental resolution of the ambiguity.

The nature of the “medium” implicit in (14) and (15) is worth stating: This medium
is spatially homogeneous and local, it does not age, and it reacts purely instantaneously —
just like vacuum in the absence of a gravitational ﬁeld. However, it is bianisotropic. As ˜γ
is real symmetric, both the permittivity and the permeability dyadics (i.e., ǫ0 ˜γ and µ0 ˜γ)
are orthorhombic and have the same eigenvectors. Furthermore, the gyrotropic–like mag-
netoelectric terms on the right sides of the two equations can be removed in the temporal–
frequency domain by a simple transform [20], so that this medium is unirefringent despite its
anisotropy. Unless ˜Γ is a null vector, this medium is not reciprocal in the Lorentz sense [21];
despite its nonreciprocity in general, the medium satisﬁes the Post constraint [22]. Finally,
the medium is nondissipative [23, p. 71].

of propagating plane waves, both propagating (real–valued k3) and evanescent (complex–

The possibility of a negative electromagnetic energy density requires discussion. In the
research on isotropic, homogeneous, dielectric–magnetic NPV materials, the negative value
has been noted [8]. Equally important is the fact that such materials have been artiﬁcially
fabricated as composite materials comprising various types of electrically small inclusions,
and their planewave response characteristics (over limited ω–ranges) are substantially as
predicted [7]. This means implies the aforementioned procedure to compute

may not be always correct. Indeed it is not, because it applies only to nondissipative and
nondispersive mediums. When account is taken of the dissipative and the dispersive nature
of the NPV materials [25],

it does turn out to be positive [9].

However, the medium in Section 3 is nondissipative and nondispersive, so that the fore-
going paragraph does not apply — but it does provide the basis for the following argument.
Electromagnetic energy densities for plane waves, howsoever computed, are not necessarily
indicative of the true picture. This is because an electromagnetic signal is of ﬁnite spatiotem-
poral extent, while plane waves are inﬁnitely extended over the entire spacetime; indeed, it
can be argued that a plane wave has inﬁnite energy! Therefore, the energy density of a signal
is meaningful, but the time–averaged energy density of a plane wave may not be. In com-
puting the energy density of a signal, one must consider the bandwidth in the ω
k domain.
Since the NPV conditions in Section 3 appear unaﬀected by ω but not by the direction of
propagation, NPV plane waves could appear in gravitationally aﬀected vacuum as part of
a pulsed electromagnetic beam (of ﬁnite cross–section) which has positive and ﬁnite energy
density.

A proposal to overcome the negative value of

it in NPV materials is to
fabricate them out of active inclusions [26]. Whereas passive inclusions are modeled in
terms of resistances, capacitances, and inductances, the modeling of active inclusions invokes
ampliﬁers as well. In other words, there is a source of energy to oﬀset negative
it.
Reverting to (11), we see that (m)dαβ could be considered as a spatiotemporally non-
homogeneous source term. The eﬀect of this term must be included in all energy density
calculations, in addition to the eﬀect of the ﬁnite spatiotemporal extent of any electromag-

source term. Thus, one must consider the total energy density, not just the electromagnetic
part of it.

Astrophysics researchers have formulated several diﬀerent energy conditions for classical
(i.e., nonquantum) GTR: all are just conjectures lacking rigorous proofs from fundamental

10

principles and were set up simply to prove certain theorems [27]. Violations of these energy
conditions are known [28, 29], and negative energy densities are invoked for the formation of
certain black holes [30] as well as for the phenomenon of superradiant scattering of electro-
magnetic, gravitational, and scalar waves [31, Sec. 12.4]. In fact, two astrophysicists have
recently written [32]:

It is often (mistakenly) believed that every kind of matter, on scales for which
we do not need to consider its quantum features, has an energy density that is
everywhere positive.

This situation arises because the local energy density of a gravitational ﬁeld cannot be
deﬁned uniquely in GTR. However, the notion of the total gravitational energy–momentum
of an isolated system — such as ADM energy–momentum [33] — is available in an asymp-
totically ﬂat spacetime; see also [34, 35]. But there is no guarantee that ADM total energy
should be positive. The condition of positivity of energy can only be expected to hold if the
spacetime is nonsingular and this condition is imposed on matter distribution [36], and that
for isolated systems [37, 38].

Under certain circumstances, many exotic solutions of general relativity have been shown
to have negative energy densities. Such studies have exploited the use of quantum ﬁelds as
possible sources of negative energy densities [39, 40, 41]. Unlike classical physics, quantum
physics does not restrict energy density to have unboundedly negative values (though there
are some bounds that constrain their duration and magnitude [39, 40]), which then enable
the quantum ﬁelds to be used to produce macroscopic eﬀects.

In summary, the issue of energy density remains to be carefully investigated for electro-
magnetic ﬁelds in gravitationally aﬀected vacuum, regardless of the satisfaction of the NPV
condition (42). This will require numerical studies with speciﬁc spacetime metrics. A similar
resolution is needed for the Casimir eﬀect [42, 43].

5 Concluding remarks

We have investigated the propagation of electromagnetic plane waves when the metric of
spacetime is Riemannian. A general conditions for negative phase velocity propagation is
established in terms of the metric components. In particular, we have demonstrated that
a gyrotropic–like magnetoelectric component is required to support NPV propagation. The
negative energy density implications of NPV propagation require further investigation.

Abstract

Meteor showers on the Earth occur at well known times, and are associated

with the decay of comets or other minor bodies whose orbital paths have

crossed the Earth’s trajectory. On the surface, determining whether or not two

orbital paths intersect appears to be a computationally intensive procedure.

This paper describes a simple geometric method for determining if the orbital

paths of two bodies (i.e., a comet and a planet) in the solar system cross

from the known ephemerides of the objects. The method is used to determine

whether or not meteor showers on other planets in the solar system could be

associated with any of 250 known comets. The dates and radiants of these

meteor showers are calculated.

I. INTRODUCTION

As they traverse their orbits about the Sun, comets slowly evaporate and fragment, leav-

ing small bits of cometary debris along their orbital tracks. Some comet orbits intersect the

Earth’s path, and the planet sweeps up a portion of these particulates each year. Generally,

these particles are drawn into the atmosphere, where they burn up at high altitudes, produc-

ing the yearly meteor showers. A sample of the meteor showers expected on a regular basis

for Earth-bound observers is given in Table I. A very detailed list of meteor streams en-

countered by the Earth has been composed based on ground-based observations of amateur

astronomers around the world [1].

Given the large number of meteor showers seen on the Earth, it seems natural to ask

about the possibility of meteor showers on other planets. It may be impractical for a sky-

observer of the future to view meteor showers from some worlds: Mercury has no atmosphere,

the clouds of Venus are so thick most meteors will likely burn up before a planetbound

observer could see them, Jupiter has no solid surface to sit on while viewing the shower,

and so forth. Never-the-less, predicting regular meteor showers on other worlds may be

important for protecting explorers and spacecraft from incoming particles, and could be

useful for planning expeditions and experiments to collect cometary material.

A great deal of modern research has been devoted to analysis of the evolution of meteor

streams in the solar system, particularly those that intersect the Earth’s orbit (for example,

detailed analyses of the evolution of the Quadrantid stream can be found in [2], [3] and [4]; the

Geminid stream is analyzed in [5] and [6]). These analyses take into account perturbations

to the orbits of the parent bodies, as well as the subsequent evolution of the debris trail after

the comet or minor body has continued on in its orbit. Over time, streams may wander

into a planet’s path causing new meteor storms, or may wander out the planet’s path

quenching a shower which has been periodic for decades or centuries (e.g., [4] estimates that

the Quadrantid shower will vanish by the year 2100).

To a ﬁrst approximation, however, meteor showers will occur if the orbit of a planet and

2

the orbit of a minor body intersect (or pass close to one another). One way to determine

if this occurs is to evolve the two orbits on a computer and watch for an intersection.

Alternatively, the methods described in this paper approach the problem of determining

orbit intersections in a completely analytical fashion, requiring only geometrical methods

and matrix algebra.

Section II describes the basic parameters and coordinate systems used to characterize or-

bits in this paper. Section III describes the rotations used to correctly orient two orbits with

respect to each other, and applies the rotations to essential vectors needed for the analysis.

Section IV uses the rotated vectors to determine the intersection between two orbital planes,

and computes the distance between the orbital paths when the planes intersect. Section V

proposes a criteria for the existence of a meteor shower based on the distance between the

orbits at intersection. The radiant and the “date” of showers meeting the criterion is deter-

mined. Section VI applies the condition of Section V to 250 known comets, summarizes the

results, and discusses the limitations of determining meteor showers using this method.

Throughout this paper, SI (Syst`eme Internationale) units are employed, except where

the size of the units makes it convenient to work in standard units employed in astronomy

(e.g., on large scales, astronomical units (AU) will be used, rather than meters).

II. DESCRIBING ORBITS

As is well known, one of the great discoveries of Johannes Kepler was that the planets

travel on elliptical paths, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse (Kepler’s First Law of

Planetary Motion, published in 1609). Since then, an enormous body of knowledge has

been developed regarding the analysis of orbital motion (see, for example [7]), allowing the

determination of the position of virtually any object in the solar system at any moment in

time.

For the work presented here, a time dependent analysis of the orbital motion is not

3

necessary 1. The only information which is required is a knowledge of the trajectory of the

orbit through space. The distance of the orbital path from the Sun may be written for

elliptical orbits as

where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit, e is the eccentricity, and θ is the angle (called the

anomaly) between the body and the axis deﬁned by perihelion, as measured in the orbital

plane. The perihelion distance for the object can be found from Eq. (1) by taking θ = 0,

yielding

(2)

The distance expressed in Eq. (1) describes the correct size and shape of an elliptical

orbit for any object around the Sun, but more information is needed to correctly orient the

orbit in three-dimensional space. This information is typically collected in a set of numbers

known as the orbital ephemeris.

The reference for orienting orbits is the plane which is coincident with the orbital plane of

the Earth, known as the ecliptic. This paper will use a reference coordinate system deﬁned

in the ecliptic plane as shown in Figure 1. The +z axis is deﬁned perpendicular to the

ecliptic and in the right handed sense with respect to the Earth’s orbital motion (i.e., when

viewed looking down the +z axis, the Earth’s motion is counter-clockwise in the xy-plane).

The +x axis is deﬁned along the direction of the Earth’s perihelion.

The orbital ephemeris of any body describes its orbit relative to the ecliptic plane, and

locates the object along its orbital path as a function of time. For the problem of determining

the possible intersection of two orbital paths, only three elements of the full ephemeris for a

diﬃcult) question to address is whether two bodies might actually collide because their orbits

intersect.

body will be needed: Ωo (a modiﬁed longitude of the ascending node), ι (inclination), and ω

(argument of perihelion). Each of these parameters is described below, and shown in Figure

2.

The longitude of the ascending node, Ω, is the angle in the ecliptic plane between the

vernal equinox (called the ﬁrst point of Aries) and the point at which the orbit crosses the

ecliptic towards the +z direction (“northward” across the ecliptic). The parameter, Ωo, used

in this paper, is an oﬀset longitude measured from the perihelion of Earth, rather than the

ﬁrst point of Aries (see Figure 3).

vector of the ecliptic.

The inclination, ι, is the angle between the normal vector of the orbit and the normal

Lastly, the argument of perihelion, ω, is the angle between the position of the body as it

crosses the ascending node and the position at perihelion, as measured in the orbital plane

of the body.

In addition to these three angles, it will be useful to deﬁne two vectors for each orbit of

interest: ˆn, the unit normal vector to the plane of the orbit, and ~rp, the vector pointing to

perihelion in the plane of the orbit.

III. ROTATIONS FOR ORBITAL ORIENTATION

In order to correctly orient an orbit with respect to the ecliptic, assume (initially) that

the orbit of interest is in the plane of the ecliptic, with the perihelion of the orbit aligned

along the +x axis (i.e., the orbit is co-aligned with the Earth’s orbit). A series of three

rotations, based on the angles

from the orbital ephemeris will produce the correct

orientation. The ﬁrst rotation will set the value of the ascending node with respect to

perihelion, the second rotation will set the inclination to the ecliptic, and the third rotation

will move the ascending node to the correct location in the ecliptic plane.

A useful method for describing rotations is in terms of matrices. While it is possible

to construct a rotation matrix for rotations about a general axis, it is more convenient to

5

conduct rotations about the coordinate axes shown in Figure 1. The matrices describing

rotations about the x-, y-, and z-axes will be denoted ˜Mx(φ), ˜My(ξ), and ˜Mz(ψ), respectively.

To demonstrate the rotations needed to orient the orbit, consider a general vector, ~A,

which is rigidly attached to the orbital plane, maintaining its orientation as the plane is

The ﬁrst rotation locates the ascending node with respect to perihelion; the rotation

depends on the value of the argument of perihelion, ω. This is done by rotating around the

z-axis by ψ = ω. In terms of rotating a general vector ~A, this can be written

~A1 = ˜Mz(ω) ~A .

(3)

When this operation is applied to the orbit, the ascending node will be located on the +x

rotated.

axis.

The orbit is inclined around an axis which passes through the ascending node and through

the Sun (at one focus of the orbit). Since the ﬁrst rotation placed the ascending node on the

+x axis, and the Sun lies at the origin of coordinates, a rotation around the x-axis by the

inclination angle, φ = ι, will correctly incline the orbit. In terms of the vector ~A1 (resulting

from Eq. (3)), this yields

~A2 = ˜Mx(ι) ~A1 .

Before the ﬁnal rotation, it will be convenient to oﬀset the longitude of the ascending node

such that it is measured from the perihelion of the Earth, rather than the vernal equinox (this

makes the x-axis the origin for measuring the longitude of the ascending node). The angle

between the vernal equinox and perihelion of Earth is simply the argument of perihelion for

Earth, ω⊕, giving (see Figure 3)

(4)

(5)

After the second rotation, the ascending node is still located on the +x axis. Rotation

about the z-axis by the oﬀset longitude, ψ = Ωo, will rotate the longitude of the ascending

Eq. (4)), this yields

the ecliptic.

~A3 = ˜Mz(Ωo) ~A2 .

(6)

The vector ~A3 (which is rigidly attached to the orbit) is correctly oriented with respect to

The two vectors which will be of use later are the unit normal vector to the orbit, ˆn, and

the perihelion vector, ~rp. When the orbital plane is co-aligned with the Earth’s (before any

rotations have been performed), these vectors have the form

IV. INTERSECTION OF ORBITS

(8)

(9)

The procedure described in Section III will correctly orient any orbit with respect to the

ecliptic. One could take any planet’s ephemeris (e.g., from the ephemerides given in Table

7

II) and construct the normal vector ˆn and perihelion vector ~rp in accordance with Eqs. (8)

and (9)2. Similar vectors could be generated for cometary ephemerides.

The real question of interest is not how the orbital planes of planets and comets are

related to the ecliptic, but rather how they are oriented with respect to each other, and in

particular where they intersect. The line deﬁning the intersection of the orbital planes can

be used to determine whether or not the orbits actually intersect.

Hereafter, assume that vectors related to a comet’s orbit will bear the subscript ‘c’

and vectors related to a planet’s orbit will bear the subscript ‘+’. Further, suppose the

components of the normal vector for a comet’s orbit are ˆnc = (a, b, c), and the components

of the normal vector of a planet’s orbit are ˆn+ = (e, f, g). Both orbital planes automatically

share one point in common: the origin, which lies at the focus of each orbital ellipse. Given

this point and the two vectors ˆnc and ˆn+, the equations describing the two orbital planes

are

found to be

To determine if the orbital paths intersect, one must know the radii of the orbits along

the line of nodes. An orbital radius may be determined from Eq. (1) if the value of the

anomaly, θ, is known. In terms of two orbits inclined with respect to each other, the angles

of interest will be the angle between the perihelion vector for each orbit, ~rp, and the node

vector, ~λ. For each orbit, the angle is deﬁned in terms of the dot product of the two vectors,

yielding

The orbits have two opportunities to intersect: at the ascending node, and at the descending

node. Eq. (13) gives the angle at a single node. To obtain the value of the anomaly at the

other node, dot the perihelion vector, ~rp, into the negative of the node vector,

~λ.

Once the anomaly is known, the distance between the orbital paths when the planes

intersect is simply

where r+ and rc are computed using Eq. (1) with the anomaly deﬁned by Eq. (13) and the

appropriate orbital parameters derived from tabulated ephemerides.

V. IS THERE A METEOR SHOWER?

The occurrence of a meteor shower associated with a particular comet will depend on

the value of the separation between the orbital paths, ∆. In this paper, the criteria for an

orbit intersection causing a meteor shower will be

Once an intersection (in the sense of Eq. (15)) has been found, one would like to identify

the associated meteor shower in some way. Meteor streams which produce showers on Earth

are named for the constellation the shower radiates from. A similar naming practice could

be implemented for the predicted showers on other planets, if a radiant could be identiﬁed.

One method of determining the location of the radiant would be to locate it in the

apparent direction of the relative velocity of the particles which comprise the shower. If the

particles in the stream follow trajectories which are approximately the same as the parent

body, and have a velocity ~vc, then an observer on the surface of a planet moving through

the stream with velocity ~v+ will measure the velocity vector of the meteors to be

~vo = ~vc

~v+ .

−

The radiant of the shower is at the point on the sky where the vector ~vo originates from.

Determining an analytic description for the instantaneous speed of a body along an elliptical

orbit is a notoriously diﬃcult problem in orbital mechanics. For simplicity, here it will be

assumed that the tangent vector to the planet’s orbit, ~τ points toward the radiant of the

shower (the ‘radiant vector’).

The tangent vector of an elliptical orbit in the xy-plane, ~τ , is given by

(19)

To represent the tangent vector for an orbit which has been properly oriented with respect

to the ecliptic, ~τ must be rotated using the procedure described in Section III.

Once the radiant vector has been found, it can be used to determine which constella-

tion the shower originates from by converting its directional information into conventional

astronomical coordinates. ~τ will point toward some direction in the three dimensional space

described by the cartesian coordinates in Figure 1. The cartesian coordinates shown are

based on the location of the Earth’s perihelion vector, and not on the origin of a particular

astronomical coordinate system. The coordinates of interest for locating the radiant of the

shower on a star chart are ecliptic (and ultimately equatorial) coordinates, with the origin at

the ﬁrst point of Aries, located in the xy-plane at an angle ψ = ω⊕ preceding the +x axis.

The components of the radiant vector may be described in cartesian coordinates which have

the +x axis coincident with the ﬁrst point of Aries by applying a rotation:

~τ ′ = ˜Mz(ω⊕)~τ .

After this rotation, the components of the radiant vector are the projections of ~τ onto a

cartesian coordinate system coincident with the ecliptic coordinates. The components may

be reduced to two angles which describe the vector’s orientation to the plane, Λ (ecliptic

longitude) and β (ecliptic latitude), deﬁned by

where ǫ is the angular distance between the north ecliptic pole and the north celestial pole

(equivalent to the tilt of the Earth’s axis with respect to the ecliptic, ǫ = 23.45◦).

Since there are no established calendars on other planets, there is no well deﬁned way

of dating a meteor shower. Here, a scheme will be adopted relating to the calendar on

Earth, illustrated in Figure 4. The ‘months’ for each planet will be deﬁned in terms of the

right ascension of Earth at the start of each month on the terrestrial calendar, αdate, and

are shown in Table III. The node vector, ~λ (which points to the planet’s encounter with

a meteor stream), will point toward a particular value of the right ascension. The right

ascension deﬁned by each node vector is compared to the values of αdate, and the meteor

shower is dated.

The critical parameters related to determining the occurrence, radiant, and date of a

possible meteor shower are illustrated in Figure 5.

VI. RESULTS & DISCUSSION

A search for comet-planet orbital intersections in the solar system was carried out using

the planetary ephemerides shown in Table II [10]4, and the comet ephemerides provided

4There is a printed error in the table listing the ephemerides of the planets in this reference: the

column ω is actually ˜ω, which is the ‘longitude of perihelion’, deﬁned as the sum of the longitude

of the ascending node (Ω) and the argument of perihelion(ω). Here, Table II lists ω.

in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s DASTCOM (Database of ASTeroids and COMets) [11].

The DASTCOM is a collection of orbital parameters and physical characteristics for the

numbered asteroids, unnumbered asteroids, periodic comets, and other selected comets,

used for analyses of solar system dynamics.

Before analyzing the data, it is useful to have an idea of what kind of results one might

expect to see. Table IV shows a breakdown of the DASTCOM comet database, where

comparisons of the orbital perihelia and aphelia of the comets and planets were used to

produce a simple estimate of the number of comets from the database which have the

possibility of intersecting the orbit of each planet. A is the number of comets which have

perihelion at radii less than a given planet’s aphelion (i.e. the closest approach of a comet

to the Sun is at least as small as the planet’s greatest distance from the Sun), and B is

the number of comets which have aphelion radii which are greater than a given planet’s

perihelion (i.e. the greatest distance from the Sun reached by a comet is at least the as

large as the planet’s closest approach to the Sun), and η is an estimate of the number of

possible comets a planet’s orbit could intersect5.

The results of the search for comet-planet orbital intersections are listed in Table V,

which speciﬁed an encounter distance of

(23)

In all, 128 possible showers were detected: 3 at Earth, 1 at Mars, 106 at Jupiter6, 17 at

5These estimates makes no account for the relative orientation of orbits; it assumes only that the

semi-major axes of the planets and comets are aligned. Possible encounters enumerated by η only

(1998 U4) twice: one intersection at a separation of ∆

other node) with a separation of ∆

10Rl, 188 possible

≤

showers are detected (data not shown in Table V): 4 at Earth, 5 at Mars, 148 at Jupiter,

24 at Saturn, 6 at Uranus, and 1 at Neptune.

As was shown in Table IV, Jupiter has the opportunity to intersect the orbits of more

comets in the database than any other planet in the solar system. It is thought that comets

with orbital scales smaller than the solar system (‘short period comets’) have evolved largely

under the inﬂuence of perturbations due to Jupiter (the mass of Jupiter is greater than

the mass of the other planets combined), giving a large population of comets which cross

Jupiter’s orbit. The search for the origin of these “Jovian family comets” has been a matter

of much numerical simulation and debate (see, for example, [12]). The disproportionately

large number of showers detected for Jupiter can be attributed to this feature of the comet

population.

An examination of Table V shows that the showers occur very close to the ecliptic, mostly

in the constellations of the zodiac. This should not be surprising, since the inclination of

the planetary orbital planes is relatively small. The tangent vectors of the planetary orbits

(which were used to deﬁne the radiants) will always point close to the ecliptic.

A good check of the procedure described in this paper is to consider the predicted showers

at Earth. In particular, the method outlined in this work predicts two meteor streams which

can be identiﬁed with known showers. The ﬁrst is the stream from Comet Tempel-Tuttle,

originating in Leo in November. This stream can be identiﬁed with the Leonid meteor shower

(known to be a stream from Tempel-Tuttle), which occurs in mid-November each year. The

second is a stream from Comet Swift-Tuttle, originating in Aries in August. This stream

can be identiﬁed with the Perseid meteor shower (known to be a stream from Swift-Tuttle),

which radiates from Perseus in August, just to the north and west of Aries. The error in the

Perseid radiant demonstrates the limitations of using the tangent vectors of the planetary

orbital planes to accurately locate the radiant of a shower.

The possible showers computed here have all assumed that the orbits of the comets are

14

static and do not precess. Further, it is assumed that the meteor streams remain attached

to those static orbits without wandering under the inﬂuence of gravitational perturbations

in the solar system. In addition, the inﬂuences of ‘local’ bodies around each planet (e.g.,

Earth’s moon, or the Galilean satellites around Jupiter) have been ignored. Never-the-less,

the method provides a useful way for determining the possibility that a given planet will

encounter a meteor stream from minor bodies in the solar system.

FIG. 2. The three essential angles for correctly orienting orbits in three dimensional space

are (a) Ωo, the (modiﬁed) longitude of the ascending node; (b) ι, the inclination; and (c) ω, the

FIG. 4. The determination of a date for a meteor shower is based on the right ascension of the

planet, as measured from the Sun, at the time it encounters the meteor stream (deﬁned by the

direction of the node vector, ~λ). The ‘months’ of the ‘year’ are deﬁned by the right ascension of

the Earth at the start of each month. The grey area shown would be March for any planet within

the March values of αdate (shown).

FIG. 5. The intersection of two orbits, showing the essential quantities for deﬁning the occur-

rence of a meteor shower: the separation of the orbits at crossing, ∆; the tangent vector to the

planet’s orbit, ~τ , which deﬁnes the ‘radiant’ of the shower; and the node vector, ~λ, which deﬁnes

the intersection of the two orbits and is used to ‘date’ the meteor shower.

Abstract. –

The anisotropy of magnetophydrodynamic turbulence is investigated by using solar wind
data from the Helios 2 spacecraft. We investigate the behaviour of the complete high-order
moment tensors of magnetic ﬁeld increments and we compare the usual longitudinal structure
functions which have both isotropic and anisotropic contributions, to the fully anisotropic
contribution. Scaling exponents have been extracted by an interpolation scaling function.
Unlike the usual turbulence in ﬂuid ﬂows, small-scale magnetic ﬂuctuations remain anisotropic.
We discuss the radial dependence of both anisotropy and intermittency and their relationship.

The idea that small scales were statistically isotropic to a high degree, in spite of the
anisotropy of large scales, is at the heart of the concept of universality underlying scaling be-
haviour in turbulent ﬂuid ﬂow [1]. As experiments became increasingly sophisticated, evidence
for the presence of anisotropy for both scalar ﬁelds [2] and velocity ﬁelds [3] has grown up.
To what extent scaling laws extracted from experiments are approximated by the scaling laws
obtained from (isotropic) cascade models [4], became an urgent issue. A workable benchmark
is represented by the following conjecture [5, 6]. Suppose that for a given statistical measur-
able quantity, scaling features can be splitted into an isotropic and an anisotropic part. We
might ask to what extent the ratio between the anisotropic and the isotropic part vanishes
as the scale goes down. Of course if we are able to deﬁne quantities for which the isotropic
part is exactly zero, we can measure scaling laws related entirely to the anisotropic part. A
formal analysis to reveal the isotropic and anisotropic contributions to structure functions
can be performed by considering their SO(3) decomposition [7]. This is based in a foliation of
various j-sectors of the linear space generated by the structure functions. For a recent review
on anisotropy in turbulent ﬂows see [8].

Anisotropy of turbulence in charged ﬂuids, described by Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
[9–11], can be due to a background magnetic ﬁeld B0, or a magnetic ﬁeld at large scales. Since
B0 cannot be cancelled out by a Galilean transformation, its direction becomes privileged with
respect to other directions. Then MHD turbulence is anisotropic to a very large extent. A
simple shell model for anisotropic MHD [10] showed that even if the energy injection rate is
isotropic, or isotropy is restored at large scales, intermediate scales and mainly small scales
are strongly anisotropic and the return-to-isotropy at small scales does not hold in MHD. This
important result has been conﬁrmed both by numerical simulations [11], and more recently
by analysis of Ulysses spacecraft in fast solar wind [12], where it is shown that strongly
intermittent and anisotropic events persist even at high frequencies.

The study of the nature of the low-frequency magnetic ﬂuctuations in the interplanetary
space, in the frequency range 10−7 Hz ≤ f ≤ 1 Hz, is important because it represents the
only way to understand the behaviour of MHD turbulence in a frequency domain which is not
accessible to any laboratory on Earth [13, 14]. Anisotropy of MHD ﬂuctuations in the solar
wind, due to the background magnetic ﬁeld transported away from the sun by the plasma
ﬂow [15, 16], has been investigated through the minimum variance analysis [17]. This method
gives informations about the energy distribution among the diﬀerent components of magnetic
ﬂuctuations. It is based on the determination of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the variance
matrix Cαβ = hBαBβi (brackets mean ensemble averages). During the so-called Alfv´enic
periods [14] one of eigenvalues is much smaller than the other two λ3 ≪ λ2 < λ1, for example
the ratios are λ1 : λ2 : λ3 = 10 : 3 : 1 [16]. The minimum variance direction turns out to be
almost parallel to B0, so the magnetic ﬂuctuations lie in a plane approximately perpendicular
to B0. These old studies have been used to investigate the spectral properties of the second-
order tensor components, and to investigate the radial evolution of anisotropy. Here we
investigate the scaling properties of anisotropy of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld, by using
the data analysis technique described extensively in Ref.s [5, 6] and [3]. This technique allows
us to deﬁne the scaling properties of anisotropy of the interplanetary space ﬂuctuations, as far
as scaling exponents of high-order tensors are considered, so that intermittency is considered.
The data we use in this work are 6 second measurements of the Interplanetary Magnetic
Field (IMF), as recorded by Helios 2 ﬂux-gate magnetometer. Velocity measurements from
Helios 2 instruments are only available at lower resolution so that the statistical accuracy
does not allow to perform the analysis presented in this work. The spacecraft followed an
ecliptic orbit with perihelion and aphelion located at about 0.3 and 1 AU, respectively. The
peripheral speed of the spacecraft along its orbit was much less than the solar wind speed so
that the latter can be still be considered aligned to the radial direction from the sun. Helios
2 magnetic ﬁeld measurements are given in a spacecraft centered reference system whose x
axis is along the radial direction and positive towards the sun, the y axis lies on the ecliptic
plane and is positive in the opposite direction with respect to the orbital motion, and the z
axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic and completes the right-handed reference system. In this
reference system, ﬁeld diﬀerences at diﬀerent lags r along the x direction can be obtained
as ∆Bα(r) = Bα(x + r) − Bα(x). The period of time used in this analysis spans across the
ﬁrst 4 months of 1976 when the spacecraft moved from 1 to 0.3 AU. During this period, for
which the solar activity was near the minimum, the solar wind was clearly characterized by
alternating fast streams and slow wind (cfr. e.g. Ref.s [13, 14]). The diﬀerent turbulent state
of the ﬂuctuations observed within these samples of fast and slow wind and the strong radial
evolution experienced by these ﬂuctuations (cfr. e.g. Ref.s [13, 14]) convinced us about the
necessity to analyze these data separately per wind speed and radial distance [18], avoiding
also to include velocity shear interfaces and the only shock that was present in this particular
data set. As a matter of fact, the radial evolution is crucial for anisotropy studies, both

Luca Sorriso-Valvo1,2, Vincenzo Carbone2, Roberto Bruno3, and Pierluigi Veltri2: Persistence of small-scale anisotropy

because of the natural evolution of intermittency [19, 20], and because of the rotation of the
mean ﬁeld along the Parker spiral. Thus, two diﬀerent samples for each wind type have been
selected, at two well separated distances from the Sun, namely at 0.9 AU and 0.3 AU (1 AU
≃ 1.5 × 108 km), each data sample including about three days of records (∼ 4.3 × 104 data
points). The switch between space and time sampling is obtained from the Taylor hypothesis,
so that x = −thvxi, the average speed being computed for each stream.

In order to measure the contribution from the anisotropic part of the ﬁeld diﬀerences, the
whole independent elements of the n-th order tensor, computed from time series, must be
studied

Sα1,α2,···,αn(r) = h[Bα1(x + r) − Bα1 (x)] [Bα2(x + r) − Bα2 (x)] · · · [Bαn (x + r) − Bαn (x)]i

(1)
For example, when n = 2 and α1 = α2 = x the usual longitudinal second-order structure
function is recovered. The latter have been studied in the past, together with the longitudinal
higher order moments [14, 19]. For each scale, some of the components of the tensor can be
proven to have contribution from the anisotropic part of the ﬁeld only (we will use in this work
Sxz for the second order, Sxxxz and Sxzzz for the fourth order structure functions) [5, 6, 12].
It is thus possible to compare the scaling behavior of such components with those of the
longitudinal structure functions (namely Sxx and Sxxxx), which includes both isotropic and
anisotropic contributions [5, 6, 12].

As a ﬁrst analysis, let us discuss the scaling of the normalized longitudinal, transverse,
and oﬀ-diagonal components of the tensor mentioned above. Figure 1 displays the scaling of
the second order longitudinal, transverse, and oﬀ-diagonal components, for both fast and slow
wind, at 0.3AU and 0.9AU. Each variable has been normalized to its own standard deviation
before computing the structure functions.

Even at a ﬁrst glance, it seems evident that the diagonal elements are more or less of the
same order at all scales. In fact, it is possible to note a scaling from the large scale values
(Sαα = 2 for uncorrelated ﬁelds) toward zero, for almost all datasets, with at most a ratio
of order 3 for all scales. Those diﬀerences are more evident far from the sun for fast wind,
while for slow wind they are already present at 0.3AU. The oﬀ-diagonal elements are about
one order of magnitude smaller than the diagonal elements. For isotropic ﬁelds, they should
vanish at large scale because of decorrelation. There are indications that this is indeed the
case, as can be seen looking at the rightmost points of the plots in Figure 1, and taking into
account the “large scale” values reported in Table I (see below). However, most of the mixed
components show the same scaling as the diagonal elements, that is they do not seem to
vanish at small scales faster than the diagonal elements. In particular, in most of the cases
the scaling at small scales is more or less the same for oﬀ-diagonal and for diagonal elements,
so that the anisotropic contribution could eventually survive at small scale. This can be seen,
for example, by looking at fast wind close to the earth, where Sxy decreases as slowly as the
diagonal Sαα = 2, while Sxz decreases more rapidly. This important result indicates that
isotropy, in fact, is not restored at small scales. In slow wind, the oﬀ-diagonal elements seem
to be more scattered and, in general, slightly higher than in fast wind. This would mean that
fast wind remains more anisotropic than slow wind. Concerning radial evolution, it might
be said that at short distance from the sun the anisotropic contributions (oﬀ-diagonal terms)
are less important, while they increase approaching the Earth. These observations suggest
that perhaps the anisotropy may be hidden by the Alfv´enic nature of turbulence, which is
more evident in fast wind and near the sun (see for example Ref.s [14, 19]), while the angle
between large scale magnetic ﬁeld (the Parker spiral proﬁle) and mean ﬂow is of course more
relevant as it is increased, far from the sun. This behaviour is even more evident by looking

information can be inferred (not shown) [21].

At variance with Ref. [12], since Sα1,α2,···,αn (r) display multiple power-law scaling, we

prefer to ﬁt the structure functions by the following Batchelor relation [5, 6, 22]

estimated independently. In particular, η is the dissipation scale, which can be estimated,
for each stream, as the IMF typical cyclotron scale, and computed directly from the data
as η = 2πmpVth/eB0, mp being the proton mass, Vth the thermal speed and e the electron
charge. Note that this scale represents in fact lower bound for the actual dissipation scale,
which cannot be directly measured from the data because of resolution limits. The integral
scale L0 is also obtained, for each stream, from the isotropic magnetic power spectra E(k)
E(k)dk. Values of L0 and η are reported in Table I. The integral
as L0 =
scale L0 increases with the distance for both types of wind, and is larger for slow wind. This
seems to indicate that turbulence is more developed in slow wind. Since the integral scale is
growing moving away from the sun [13, 14], but at the same time the estimated dissipation
scale increases more rapidly, the inertial range and thus the Reynolds number get smaller
moving away from the sun, as happens in decaying turbulence [4], and in disagreement with
previous analysis [23].

The multiple power-law behavior of the structure functions is described by equation (2)
through the exponent Cα1,α2,···,αn , which are the scaling parameters obtained from the ﬁt of
the data corresponding to the inertial range scaling, such that the usual scaling exponent can
be recovered as ζα1,···,αn = n − 2Cα1,···,αn [5, 6]. This can easily be tested by dividing the
−n, and observing the power-
structure functions by the factor [1 + Dα1,···,αn (r/L0)]
law behavior, with exponent ζα1,···,αn , of the resulting extended structure function. Figure 2
shows the behaviour of some second order mixed structure functions, for both fast and slow
wind, and at two heliocentric distances, together with the ﬁt with equation (2), as well as the
compensated function and a power-law ﬁt for one case. It is evident that equation (2) can
reproduce the data with very good agreement, so that the values obtained for the reduced χ2
are always less than unity. The most striking diﬀerences between structure functions computed
for fast and slow wind are shown by the data samples recorded close to the sun (0.3 AU). In
addition, a remarkable radial evolution is clearly visible, and it is stronger for fast wind, as
already observed in diﬀerent contexts [13, 14].

2Cα1,···,αn

The values of the exponents obtained from the ﬁt of the second and fourth order structure
functions tensor longitudinal and fully anisotropic components with equation (2) are listed in
table II, for both fast and slow wind, at 0.3 AU and 0.9 AU. For both slow and fast wind
the diﬀerences between the longitudinal and the anisotropic components are small. Once
more this implies that the anisotropic contribution does not vanish at small scales, but its
contribution to the scaling laws is, at least, decreasing as slowly as the isotropic part.

In conclusion, we have investigated anisotropy of magnetic ﬂuctuations as they are mea-
sured in the interplanetary space, by using a method which allows to extract anisotropic
exponents by avoiding mixing with the isotropic sector [5, 6, 12]. The normalized isotropic
longitudinal components, and the fully anisotropic components of the second and higher or-
ders structure function tensor are shown to have similar scaling toward the small scales,

where anisotropy eﬀects could be expected to vanish. This can be interpreted as an evidence
that small scale anisotropy is present. Then, following Kurien and Sreenivasan [5, 6] scaling
exponents have been extracted by using a scaling function that interpolates the high-order
tensor components. The comparison between the scaling exponents of the longitudinal and of
the anisotropic components shows once again that small-scale ﬂuctuations remain anisotropic.
Thus, the return-to-isotropy invoked in the usual ﬂuid ﬂows does not work in MHD turbulence
to a very large extent.

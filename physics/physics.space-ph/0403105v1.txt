A relativistic bounce-averaged quasilinear diﬀusion equation is derived to describe
stochastic particle transport associated with arbitrary-frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctu-
ations in a nonuniform magnetized plasma. Expressions for the elements of a relativistic
quasilinear diﬀusion tensor are calculated explicitly for magnetically-trapped particle dis-
tributions in axisymmetric magnetic geometry in terms of gyro-drift-bounce wave-particle
resonances. The resonances can destroy any one of the three invariants of the unperturbed
guiding-center Hamiltonian dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION

Understanding the phase-space transport of magnetically-trapped relativistic electrons
is an intrinsically interesting general problem, and it is an especially important problem
in magnetospheric plasma physics because these energetic particles can damage spacecraft
electronics and they present a radiation hazard to astronauts. The quasilinear theory of
such anomalous transport processes is based on resonant wave-particle interactions in which
characteristic wave frequencies match one or more of the orbital frequencies associated
with the gyration, bounce, and drift motion of charged particles [1, 2, 3]. In particular,
diﬀusion due to drift-resonances with low-frequency MHD waves [4, 5, 6] and diﬀusion
due to cyclotron-resonances with various high-frequency waves [7, 8, 9, 10] are frequently
cited as important transport mechanisms for relativistic electrons in Earth’s magnetosphere.
Previous work on these transport mechanisms has typically been restricted to either the low-
frequency wave interactions, which may break the second and third invariants, or the high-
frequency wave interactions, which may break the ﬁrst and second invariants. However,
there has been little work on a uniﬁed theory in which all the interactions can be considered
together.

Our previous work [11] (henceforth refered to as Paper I) investigated relativistic quasi-
linear diﬀusion transport due to low-frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctuations, which pre-
served the ﬁrst adiabatic invariant, based on the low-frequency relativistic gyrokinetic
Vlasov equation [12, 13, 14]. In the present work, we modify the low-frequency gyroki-
netic formalism to allow for arbitrary-frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctuations (and, thus,
allow for processes which break any one of the three invariants) and retain full ﬁnite-
Larmor-radius (FLR) eﬀects associated with the electromagnetic ﬂuctuations. Although
FLR eﬀects are not important for interactions of relativistic electrons with MHD waves,
they are crucial for interactions with cyclotron-frequency waves [7, 8].

A. Canonical Quasilinear Formalism

The derivation of a quasilinear diﬀusion equation in canonical action space (with coordi-
nates J) was ﬁrst performed by Kaufman [1], in which the background Vlasov distribution
F0(J, τ ) evolves on a slow time scale (τ = ǫ2 t) determined by the amplitude (ordered by
the dimensionless parameter ǫ) of the electric and magnetic ﬂuctuations. The quasilinear
diﬀusion equation in action space is given in its general form as

∂F0
∂τ

≡

·

(1)

where the action coordinates J may either be exact invariants (corresponding to exact sym-
metries) or adiabatic invariants (corresponding to approximate symmetries). The canonical

2

quasilinear (CQL) diﬀusion tensor [1, 11] is expressed as

DCQL =

where δ
Hmk denotes the Fourier component of the perturbation Hamiltonian δH with a
discrete frequency spectrum (represented by the wave frequency ωk) and m · Ω = mi Ωi
(summation over repeated indices is, henceforth, implied), with Ωi = ∂H0/∂J i denoting
the unperturbed orbital frequency.

f

The expression (2) clearly establishes the paradigm of quasilinear transport theory:
wave-particle resonances (where ωk = m · Ω) introduce explicit violations of the invariance
(exact or adiabatic) of action coordinates leading to stochastic transport in action space.
Note that the canonical quasilinear diﬀusion tensor (2) can be written

DCQL =

in terms of the canonical quasilinear coeﬃcient matrix d(CQL)
m,k = mm and the canonical
quasilinear potential Γ(CQL)

linear transport is represented by the dimensionality of the coeﬃcient matrix dm,k and
the universality of quasilinear transport is represented by the fact that a single quasilinear
potential Γm,k describes quasilinear transport along diﬀerent action coordinates.

B. Organization of Paper

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the unper-
turbed and perturbed relativistic guiding-center equations in terms of magnetic coordinates
(ψ, ϕ, s) associated with an unperturbed axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. The
invariant coordinates I = (Jg, ε, Jd) in axisymmetric magnetic geometry are the relativis-
tic guiding-center gyro-action Jg, the relativistic guiding-center kinetic energy ε, and the
guiding-center drift action Jd = qψ/c. Here, energy ε is used instead of the bounce action
Jb to ensure that all three of the invariant coordinates are local (i.e., they depend on local
properties of the background plasma). The perturbation guiding-center Hamiltonian δH,
expressed in terms of the perturbation electromagnetic potentials (δφ, δA), causes the de-
struction of the unperturbed invariants I (i.e., δ ˙I = {I, δH} 6= 0, where { , } represents
the Poisson bracket) and leads to stochastic quasilinear diﬀusion in invariant I-space due
to resonant wave-particle resonances.

In Secs. III and IV, an explicit expression for the relativistic quasilinear diﬀusion equa-
tion (1) in axisymmetric magnetic geometry in terms of the invariant coordinates (Jg, ε, Jd)
is derived. In Sec. III, the quasilinear coeﬃcient matrix dmk is derived and then, in Sec. IV,
the quasilinear potential Γm,k. The present derivation follows closely the derivation found
in Paper I [11]. We summarize our results in Sec. V and discuss applications.

3

Since quasilinear diﬀusion is often described in the literature (e.g., see Ref. [2]) in terms
of the equatorial pitch angle instead of the gyro-action, the corresponding relativistic quasi-
linear diﬀusion equation (1) is presented in Appendix A. In particular, we show how the
quasilinear coeﬃcient matrix transforms when the relativistic guiding-center gyro-action Jg
is replaced with the equatorial pitch angle. Lastly, Appendix B presents two expressions for
the bounce-averaged drift frequency which might be useful for computational applications.

II. RELATIVISTIC GUIDING-CENTER DYNAMICS IN AXISYMMETRIC MAGNETIC

GEOMETRY

We begin our analysis of relativistic quasilinear transport in axisymmetric magnetic
geometry by ﬁrst providing a general representation of axisymmetric magnetic geometry
in terms of magnetic coordinates (also known as Euler or Clebsch potentials). Next, we
present the equations of relativistic guiding-center Hamiltonian dynamics in unperturbed
and perturbed axisymmetric magnetic geometry. Unperturbed guiding-center Hamilto-
nian dynamics establishes the existence of three invariants, which are then destroyed by
arbitrary-frequency electromagnetic perturbation ﬁelds.

In the spirit of perturbation theory, we assume that electric ﬁelds are not part of the
quasi-static background ﬁelds (i.e., electric ﬁelds are automatically viewed as perturbation
ﬁelds) and any axisymmetry-breaking magnetic ﬁelds are viewed as zero-frequency magnetic
perturbation ﬁelds. The validity of these assumptions will be checked in future work when
an alternate model including a more realistic non-axisymmetric magnetic geometry and a
background electric ﬁeld is considered.

A. Axisymmetric Magnetic Geometry

The background magnetic ﬁeld in axisymmetric magnetic geometry can be expressed

in terms of magnetic coordinates (ψ, ϕ, s) as

B = ∇ψ × ∇ϕ = B(ψ, s)

∂X
∂s

,

where ψ denotes the magnetic (radial) ﬂux function (i.e., B · ∇ψ = 0), the azimuthal angle
ϕ is an ignorable coordinate (i.e., in axisymmetric magnetic geometry, unperturbed scalar
ﬁelds are independent of ϕ), and s is the parallel spatial coordinate along a single magnetic
ﬁeld line labeled by (ψ, ϕ).

The magnitude B(ψ, s) of the magnetic ﬁeld, on the one hand, is deﬁned from Eq. (4)
as B = ∇ψ × ∇ϕ · ∇s and B−1(ψ, s) denotes the Jacobian for the transformation X →
b = B/B = ∂sX, on the other hand, can be
(ψ, ϕ, s). The local magnetic unit vector
expressed as

(4)

b = ∇s + a(ψ, s) ∇ψ

Here the scalar ﬁeld

a(ψ, s) =

which characterizes the non-orthogonality of the coordinates (ψ, s), is required to ensure
that ∇ ×
b =
(∂sa) ∇ψ. We note that, for an axisymmetric dipole magnetic ﬁeld (which is curl-free), we
b
can write B = ∇χ(ψ, s) and, thus, using Eq. (5), we ﬁnd ∂χ/∂s = B and ∂χ/∂ψ = aB.

b 6= 0 and is associated with magnetic curvature [11] through the relation ∂s

b

Next, we deﬁne the radius R(ψ, s) ≡ |∇ϕ|−1 (which measures the distance to the
symmetry axis) and obtain the expression |∇ψ| = BR from Eq. (4). We can, thus, deﬁne
the following perpendicular unit vectors

ψ = (BR)−1 ∇ψ and

ϕ = R ∇ϕ,

such that the unit vectors (

center Lagrangian is written as

L0 = Jd ˙ϕ + pk ˙s + Jg

˙ζ − ε,

where A = ψ ∇ϕ is the vector potential associated with the magnetic ﬁeld (4) and Jd =
qψ/c denotes the drift action, while, using Eq. (7), the magnitude of the relativistic guiding-
center parallel momentum is

|pk| = γM |vk| =

ε2/c2 + 2M (ε − Jgωg).

The unperturbed relativistic guiding-center Poisson bracket { , }, on the other hand, is
expressed in terms of two arbitrary functions F and G on guiding-center phase space as

The Jacobian for the guiding-center transformation

(x, p) → Z α = (Jd, ϕ, s, ε, Jg, ζ)

is J = 1/|vk|, where |vk| is obtained from Eq. (9). We note that the Poisson bracket (10)
can also be expressed in phase-space divergence form as

{F, G} =

(cid:16)
which must be true for all Hamiltonians H and, thus, we obtain the Liouville identities
(13). In particular, the Liouville identities for β = ϕ and ζ, respectively, are

which follow from the deﬁnitions for ωc, |vk|, and ωd. We further note that although the
magnetic coordinate ψ and the drift action Jd are simply related in axisymmetric magnetic
geometry, this simple relation is destroyed by non-axisymmetry; we, henceforth, use ψ

6

and Jd separately as follows: Jd is used whenever dynamics is concerned while ψ is used
whenever magnetic coordinates are concerned.

As in Paper I [11], the unperturbed guiding-center Hamilton’s equations, expressed
in terms of the coordinates (Jd, ϕ, s; ε, Jg, ζ) and the unperturbed relativistic guiding-
center Hamiltonian H0 = ε, include the magnetic-coordinate components of the relativistic
guiding-center velocity

˙Jd0 = 0,

˙ϕ0 = ωd, and ˙s0 = vk

and the velocity-space guiding-center equations

˙ε0 = 0 = ˙Jg0 and ˙ζ0 = ωc .

Thus, the drift action Jd (= qψ/c), the kinetic energy ε, and the gyro-action Jg are the
three invariants of unperturbed relativistic guiding-center motion in axisymmetric magnetic
geometry. From these unperturbed Hamilton’s equations we construct the unperturbed
time evolution (Vlasov) operator

In the absence of electromagnetic ﬂuctuations, the unperturbed Vlasov equation d0F0/dt =
0, therefore, implies that the unperturbed (background) Vlasov distribution F0(I) is a
function of the three guiding-center invariants I = (Jg, ε, Jd) associated with axisymmetric
magnetic geometry. In the present work, in order to correctly account for wave-particle
gyroresonance eﬀects, we retain full ﬁnite-Larmor-radius (FLR) eﬀects associated with
electromagnetic ﬂuctuations and, thus, we need an expression for the gyroradius ρ. The
gyroradius vector ρ(X, ε, Jg, ζ) is deﬁned locally in terms of the magnetic coordinates as

In Sec.IV, the spatial dependence of the perturbed electromagnetic ﬁelds (in guiding-
center phase- space) will involve the combination ψi + ρ · ∇ψi, which denotes the position
x = X + ρ of a particle in terms of the guiding-center magnetic coordinates ψi = (ψ, ϕ, s).
Here, using Eqs. (6) and (18), we ﬁnd

ρ · ∇ψ = ρ |∇ψ| cos ζ ≡ ∆ψ cos ζ

ρ · ∇ϕ = − ρ |∇ϕ| sin ζ ≡ − (ρ/R) sin ζ

C. Perturbed Guiding-Center Dynamics

The presence of ﬂuctuating electric and magnetic ﬁelds

δE = − ∇δφ − c−1 ∂tδA and δB = ∇ × δA,

where δφ and δA are the perturbed scalar and vector potentials, respectively, implies that
the three unperturbed invariants (Jg, ε, Jd) are no longer invariants. The perturbed electro-
magnetic potentials introduce perturbations in the relativistic guiding-center Lagrangian
(8): L0 → L0 + δL, which, to ﬁrst order in the perturbed potentials, yields

δL =

where the notation δgcχ is deﬁned in Eq. (21). As a result of the magnetic perturbation (the
ﬁrst term in Eq. (23)), the relativistic guiding-center Poisson bracket (10) is also perturbed
unless we deﬁne the perturbed Hamiltonian δH as

From Eqs. (25) and (27), we note that the gyro-action Jg and the drift-action Jd are de-
stroyed if the perturbation Hamiltonian δH depends on the gyro-angle ζ and the azimuthal
angle ϕ, respectively. Moreover, the destruction of the gyro-action invariance leads to the
possible loss of trapped particles while the destruction of the drift-action invariance leads
to radial transport.

III. RELATIVISTIC QUASILINEAR DIFFUSION TENSOR

In this Section, we proceed with a two-time-scale analysis of the perturbed Vlasov

equation

+ ǫ

d0δF

= − ǫ {(F0 + ǫ δF ), δH},

(31)

where the unperturbed evolution operator d0/dt is deﬁned in Eq. (17) and the Vlasov dis-
tribution F is decomposed as F = F0(I, τ = ǫ2t) + ǫ δF . The fast-time-scale evolution
equation shows, on the one hand, how the perturbed Vlasov distribution δF evolves under
the inﬂuence of electromagnetic perturbation ﬁelds. The slow-time-scale evolution equa-
tion, on the other hand, shows how the background distribution F0 changes as a result of
wave-particle resonances. Following our previous work (Paper I), we now proceed with the
separation of the perturbed guiding-center Vlasov distribution

δF =

(32)

in terms of the adiabatic part of δF (the ﬁrst term) and the non-adiabatic part of δF
(the second term), which explicitly represents resonant wave-particle eﬀects. The fast-time

Since the guiding-center background distribution F0 is quasi-static on the wave time

averaging operation [denoted as (· · ·) and refered to as wave averaging] with respect to the
fast wave-time-scale, the azimuthal angle, and the gyro-angle, with the property

F 0 = F0(I; τ = ǫ2t).

found in Eqs. (25)-(27) and (29), respectively.

When the slow-time evolution equation (35) for the guiding-center background distribu-

The slow-time evolution equation (36) for the background distribution F0 contains terms
associated with exact derivatives in invariant I-space (as expected) plus a term involving
b · ∇ = ∂/∂s) along magnetic ﬁeld lines. Since the background
parallel spatial gradients (
distribution F0 is independent of the parallel spatial coordinate s (i.e., ∂F0/∂s = 0), we
must remove the parallel-gradient terms on the right side of Eq. (36) by introducing a
second averaging operation.

where the invariant coordinates are the gyro-action I 1 = Jg, the particle guiding-center

Note the simplicity of the quasilinear coeﬃcient matrix dmk when expressed in terms of the
invariant coordinates I = (Jg, ε, Jd). Since the quasilinear transport of trapped particles
(e.g., see Ref. [2]) is often discussed in terms of the equatorial pitch angle instead of the
gyro-action Jg, an alternative representation of the quasilinear coeﬃcient matrix expressed
in terms of the equatorial pitch-angle instead of the gyro-action is presented in Appendix A.
Although the pitch-angle formulation will facilitate comparison with earlier works, however,
the simplicity of the quasilinear coeﬃcient matrix in Eq. (48) is lost.

IV. QUASILINEAR POTENTIAL

To complete the derivation of the relativistic quasilinear diﬀusion tensor DQL, with com-
ponents given by Eq. (48), we must now solve for an explicit expression for the quasilinear

A. Guiding-Center Perturbation Hamiltonian

In the present work (as in Paper I [11]), we use the gauge condition δA · ∇ϕ = 0 so

that the perturbed vector potential is written as

δA = δAk ∇s − δβ ∇ψ,

(49)

where δAk = ∂δα/∂s denotes the parallel component of the perturbed vector potential and
the perpendicular components of the perturbed vector potential δA⊥ = δA − δAk

V. SUMMARY

The present work has presented a complete derivation of the relativistic bounce-averaged
quasilinear diﬀusion equation associated with arbitrary-frequency electromagnetic ﬂuctua-
tions in axisymmetric geometry. The main results are the relativistic quasilinear equation,

Kmℓk is given by Eq. (66)
Eq. (47) and the corresponding diﬀusion tensor, Eq. (79), where δ

or Eq. (67).
bounce-averaging, and the Fourier-Bessel components (denoted by a tilde) are deﬁned in
Eq. (61). The diﬀusion tensor is also presented in energy, pitch-angle coordinates in Ap-
pendix A.

f

Future work will include a comparative study with previous analytical models of pitch-
angle and energy diﬀusion [7, 8], and with calculations of radial diﬀusion coeﬃcients [2, 5, 6],
plus generalization to allow non-axisymmetric unperturbed electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In
related work, a numerical implementation of the present relativistic quasilinear diﬀusion
including the oﬀ-
equation in a multi-dimensional simulation code is being developed,
diagonal transport terms (in collaboration with Dr. Jay Albert).

Appendix A. Equatorial Pitch-Angle Formulation

Since quasilinear transport is often discussed in terms of the equatorial pitch-angle
instead of the gyro-action Jg [2], we introduce the cosine of the equatorial pitch angle

which follows from the deﬁnition (9) for pk, we ﬁnd that the second and third terms in
Eq. (B.1) cancel each other and, hence, only the ﬁrst term in Eq. (B.1) remains. The
bounce-averaged drift frequency is, therefore, given as

hωdi =

Based on this expression, we deﬁned in Eq. (A.3) the equatorial drift frequency ωd0.

An alternative expression for hωdi is obtained by introducing the bounce action

and the bounce frequency

Jb =

so that the bounce-averaged drift frequency (B.2) can also be expressed as

hωdi = = −

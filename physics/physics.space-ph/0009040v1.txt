We perform direct analysis of mirror mode instabilities from the general dielectric tensor for several model
distributions, in the longwavelength limit. The growth rate at the instability threshold depends on the derivative
of the distribution for zero parallel energy. The maximum growth rate is always ∼ kkvT k and the instability
is of nonresonant kind. The instability growth rate and its dependence on the propagation angle depend on the
shape of the ion and electron distribution functions.

INTRODUCTION

Numerous observations of waves in the the Earth magnetosheath, as well as at other planets have stimulated studies of long-
wavelength and low-frequency modes in high β magnetized plasmas. It has been theoretically shown that the features of low-
frequency waves in hot plasmas differ signiﬁcantly from those in cool plasmas, even in the limit corresponding to the usual
magnetohydrodynamic waves [1]. These ﬁndings have been subsequently proven by direct comparison with observations [2].
However, particular interest to the low-frequency modes in hot plasmas is explained by observations of the mirror modes, which
were found in planetary magnetosheaths [3, 4, 5, 6], in the solar wind [7], in cometary comas [8, 9], and in the wake of Io [10, 11].
These modes are nonpropagating zero frequency modes (sometimes considered as the kinetic counterpart of the hydrodynamical
entropy mode), which are expected to grow in an anisotropic plasma with sufﬁciently high β⊥/βk (see, e.g., Hasegawa [12]).

Usual high amplitudes of observed mirror modes show that they easily achieve the nonlinear regime. At the same time, in
several cases low-amplitude magnetic ﬁeld structures with the same properties were observed which may mean that the linear
and nonlinear mirror mode features are generically related. Yet we do not know so far what makes these modes so ubiquitous
and what determines their nonlinear amplitudes.

The early explanation of the mirror instability [12] is based on the simple picture of the adiabatic response of the anisotropic
pressure of magnetized particles. Numerical analyses of the mirror instability in bi-Maxwellian plasmas [13, 14, 15] have shown
that the maximum of the growth rate occurs at k⊥ρi ∼ 1 (where ρi is the ion thermal gyroradius), which was interpreted as an
indication on the kinetic nature of the instability.
At the same time, Southwood and Kivelson [16] proposed a new explanation of the instability mechanism as a resonant one,
where the presence of a group of the resonant particles (with vk = 0) plays the destructive role in the mode excitation: the
growth rate of the instability is claimed to be inversely proportional to the number of the resonant particles. This explanation
was further reiterated with some modiﬁcations by Pantellini and Schwartz [17] and Pokhotelov et al. [18], and used by Kivelson
and Southwood [19] for the explanation of the nonlinear saturation mechanism. The analysis of Southwood and Kivelson [16]
is done in the regime where the phase velocity of the perturbation is much less than the parallel thermal velocity, in other
words, γ ≪ kkvT ik, and therefore, is directly applied only at the very threshold of the instability. At the same time, numerical
calculations [15] show that most important events occur in the range γ ∼ kkvT ik, which is not covered in the previous analytical
studies.
The previous analytical and numerical considerations of the linear regime of the mirror instability, even in the longwavelength
limit, are, as a rule, restricted to the usage of the bi-Maxwellian distribution. At the same time particle distributions in collision-
less plasma may substantially differ from the Maxwellian. For example, due to the ion heating mechanism at the shock (see, e.g.,
Sckopke et al. [20]), the magnetosheath ion distributions may well deviate from the bi-Maxwellian. It is therefore of interest to
study the dependence of the instability on the shape of the ion and electron distributions.

Yet another argument in favor of the analysis of other distributionsf is that there is no good analytical approximations for the
dielectric tensor for the Maxwellian plasma in the range |ω|/kkvT k ∼ 1, which forced researchers to consider more convenient
asymptotics. It is, however, possible to ﬁnd the shapes of the distribution which allow closed analytical presentation of the
dielectric tensor in the whole range of phase velocities and make the study of the instability physics more transparent.

In the present paper we study in detail the dependence of the mirror instability on the shape of the ion and electron distributions,
using model distribution functions which allow direct explicit analytical calculation of the dielectric tensor. We establish the

generic relation of the mirror instability with the oscillatory modes when the Landau damping is absent and study the transition
of damping modes to the unstable regime. We also propose an approximation which is useful for the analytical treatment of the
instability in the most important range γ ∼ kkvT ik in general case.
The paper is organized as follows. In section II we derive the general dispersion relation in the longwavelength for arbi-
trary distribution function. In sections III-IV we apply the general analysis to three different distributions. In section V we
derive the instability condition and the growth rate at the threshold for arbitrary distribution. In section VI we develop a useful
approximation for the analysis of the bi-Maxwellian-kind distributions in the region of the maximum growth rate.

II. DISPERSION RELATION IN THE LONGWAVELENGTH LIMIT

In what follows we will be interested in the longwavelength limit where ω ≪ Ω and kvT ≪ Ω, while maintaining the
phase velocity ﬁnite 0 < ω/k < ∞. The last inequality means that the phase velocity does not tend to zero in all propagation
angle range but it certainly may vanish for particular set of parameters. For simplicity we assume that both ions and electrons
are Maxwellian in the perpendicular direction, so that hv2

βk,⊥ = 2v2
refraction index vector N = kc/ω, such that N = (N⊥, 0, Nk) = N (sin θ, 0, cos θ). With all this the components of the
dispersion matrix Dij = N 2δij − NiNj − ǫij take the following form (see Appendix B):

In the limit ω/Ωi → 0(and ω/k ﬁnite) the dispersion relation D = detkDijk = 0 splits into two ones. One describes the

Eq. (9) describes elliptically polarized waves with all three components of the wave electric ﬁeld present, so that in general there
exists a nonzero component of the wave magnetic ﬁeld Bz = N⊥Ey in the direction of the external magnetic ﬁeld. These waves
not only rotate the magnetic ﬁeld but change its magnitude as well.

The functions ¯χ play the crucial role in the subsequent analysis. They are deﬁned by the integral containing the distribution
function f (vk) and cannot be explicitly calculated without particular choice of these distributions. It is common to choose f
as Maxwellian. In this case ¯χ is well-known and tabulated but has good asymptotic expansions only for |Z| ≪ 1 or |Z| ≫ 1
(for electrons Z should be substituted by Z(me/mi)(vT ik/vT ek)). This actually restricts possible analytical considerations of
the mirror instability only with the range |Z| ≪ 1. Yet, numerical analyses show that the most important events occur in the
vicinity of |Z| ∼ 1 which is unavailable to direct theoretical analysis when Maxwellian is chosen. On the other hand, there
are vague indications that the qualitative features of long waves (instabilities) in the high β more or less sensibly depend on
the lowest moments of the distribution function (provided it is sufﬁciently “normal”: smooth, no beams, no holes, etc.). It
therefore makes sense to investigate the dispersion relations for a suitably chosen model distribution so that ¯χ can be calculated
and analyzed in the range |Z| ∼ 1. In what follows we shall use three different distributions for these purposes. The waterbag
distribution f = Θ(v2
k)/2v0 will be used for study of the behavior of longwavelength modes and their dependence on
0 − v2
the plasma parameters in the absence of Landau damping. Here Θ(x) = 1 if x > 0 and Θ(x) = 0 if x < 0. The hard-bell
distribution f = 3(v2
0 will allow to include the Landau damping effects, and the Lorentz-like distribution
0 − v2
k)−2 removes the upper limit on the particle velocities. The four distributions (including Maxwellian
f = (2v3
f = (2πv2

T k)) mentioned in this paper are shown in Figure 1.

III. WATERBAG

The waterbag distribution f = Θ(v2

k)/2v0 is somewhat peculiar since the Landau damping is absent. The analysis of
this distribution allows to establish the generic relation of the instability to nondamping propagating modes. It is easy to ﬁnd
that in this case

0/3. In the limit Z = 0 one has d ≡ ¯χ(Z = 0) = 1/3. It is
where µ = me/mi ≈ 1/2000, R = βik/βek, and v2
worth noting that for the Maxwellian distribution d = 1. In this section we use for electrons the approximation of the massless
bi-Maxwellian (instead of above waterbag,which is used only for ions), for which ¯χe = 1. The resulting dispersion relation
(9) is a third order equation with respect to Z 2 with real coefﬁcients. Although this equation can be analyzed directly and even
solved analytically, graphical representation of the roots is much more convenient.

T k = v2

Figure 2 shows the mode with the highest phase velocity (fast mode) for the case when βik = βi⊥ = βek = βe⊥ = 0.1 and
massless bi-Maxwellian electrons. It it worth noting that ions are not isotropic since they are Maxwellian in the perpendicular
direction and waterbag in the parallel direction. The phase velocity of the fast mode is well above kkvT ik so that it has nothing to
do with the mirror instability. We do not consider this mode in the rest of the paper. We do not consider the Alfven mode either.
The remaining two low-phase velocity modes are shown in Figure 3 together with ω = kkv0i (solid line). The upper curve is
above the resonant region having |ω| > |kkvk| for all ions. The lower mode is inside the resonant region and would damp if
there were nonzero ∂f /∂vk.
Figure 4 shows the same two modes but in the case βik = βi⊥ = βek = βe⊥ = 0.5. In both cases the naive instability

condition

K = β⊥/βk − 2 − 2/β⊥ > 0

(11)

is not fulﬁlled, although in the second case K is closer to the threshold just because of the larger β⊥. There is no much
difference in the behavior of the two modes for these two cases, except a little stronger decrease of the phase velocities towards
the perpendicular propagation regime in the higher β⊥ case.

Figure 5 shows the behavior of the two modes in the anisotropic case βik = βek = 0.1, βi⊥ = βe⊥ = 0.5 (so that K = 1),
and bi-Maxwellian electrons. The lower mode now remains purely propagating mode for smaller angles (diamonds) but turns
into an aperiodic instability for larger angles of propagation (stars). The obvious conclusion from Figure 5 is that the unstable
mode has its propagation counterpart for the smaller angles of propagation. The relative growth rate G = γ/kkvT ik ∼ 1 is large
in the whole range of instability, so that the approximation G ≪ 1 [16] is not applicable.
It is of interest to compare this case with the massless waterbag electrons ¯χe = 1/3. The corresponding curves in Figure 6
show that there is no instability in this case despite the fact that the threshold (11) is exceeded.

Thus, the analysis of the waterbag distribution already shows that (a) there is, in general, the propagating counterpart of the
mirror instability if Landau damping is absent, (b) the instability threshold and growth rate are sensitive to the details of the

distribution and not only to the second moment, and (c) the instability is aperiodic, that is, in the unstable range W = 0 and
G > 0. It can be shown that the last feature is generally valid unless the distribution function is very peculiar (see Appendix C).

IV. HARD-BELL AND LORENTZ DISTRIBUTIONS

The waterbag distribution does not allow Landau damping since ∂f /∂vk = 0 everywhere. In order to get rid of this restriction
0, which has nonzero derivative but is is compact (f = 0

We shall also compare the results for these distributions with the bi-Maxwellian. In this case there is no compact analytical

expression for χ and we use direct numerical calculation.

In what follows we are interested only in the unstable region. The subparticle mode is expected to be strongly damped in the

propagation range. The “superparticle” mode is not damped in the hard-bell case and almost not damped in the Lorentz case.

As the ﬁrst set of parameters for the unstable regime we choose βik = βek = 0.1, βi⊥ = βe⊥ = 0.5, and massless bi-
Maxwellian electrons ¯χe = 1. Figure 7 shows the growth rates for the three distributions. The highest growth rate is for the
Lorentzian, the lowest is for the waterbag. Figure 8 shows the same growth rates as in Figure 7 but normalized on kvT ik which
allows to compare growth rates of the modes with the same wavenumber k and different angles of propagation. It is seen that the
maximum growth rates is achieved approximately at the same angle of propagation ≈ 60◦ for all distributions, but the threshold
angle moves towards more quasiparallel regimes for distributions with stronger tails (Maxwellian and Lorentzian).
Figure 9 shows the dependence of the growth rate on β⊥ when K = 1 and βi⊥/βek = βik/βek = 1 remain constant. Both
curves correspond to the waterbag ions and massless bi-Maxwellian electrons. Diamonds stand for the same parameters as in
Figure 5, crosses correspond to βi⊥ = 1 and βik = 0.25. The instability is stronger for higher β⊥.

In the previous analysis we always used the approximation of massless bi-Maxwellian distribution corresponding to χe = 1.
Figures 10 and 11 show the growth rate of the instability when the electron distributions are chosen in the same form as the
ion distributions. One can see that the waterbag distributions become stable, while the growth rate in the case of Lorentzian
drastically increases. The ratio of the maximum growth rates shown in Figures 8 and 11 roughly corresponds to de = χe(Z = 0)
which shows that the maximum growth rate signiﬁcantly on electrons (see sections V and VI).

For other combinations of ion and electron distributions the ratios may be even greater as is seen in Figure 12, where diamonds
correspond to waterbag ions and massless bi-Maxwellian electrons, while circles correspond to waterbag ions and Lorentz
electrons. The β parameters are the same for both cases.

It is possible to obtain general results just above the threshold of the instability, where Z = iG → +0. For f = f (v2) it is

easy to ﬁnd

It is instructive to consider several simple cases. We can neglect completely the electron contribution by putting de = 0,

This condition is harder for more compact distributions (d = 1/3 for waterbag and d = 3/5 for hard-bell) and softer for
distributions with long tails (d = 1 for Maxwellian and d = 3 for Lorentzian). The global instability condition (19) can be
written in a more symmetric form as follows:

which emphasizes the symmetric role of ions and electrons in the instability onset (cf. Pokhotelov et al. [18]).

Indeed, near the threshold γ/kkvT k ≪ 1 and the response of both electrons and ions is adiabatic, that is, their inertia does
not play any role. In these circumstances the mass of the particle is of not importance. Their role in the response to the parallel
electric ﬁeld is, however, antisymmetric because of the different signs of the charge: the adiabatic response is obtained from
eEz − (1/n)(dp/dz) = eEz − ikkp/n = 0. The parallel response plays the crucial role in the instability development. As is
known the instability occurs because of the breakdown of the local frozen-in condition and efﬁcient drag of particles out of the
ﬁeld enhancement into the ﬁeld depletion region [16, 17, 18]. Thus, when the magnetic ﬁeld is perturbed, Bz = B0 + δBz, the

where we have taken into account that µ = T⊥/B0. Eq. (27) shows that smaller Debye lengths rD (larger d) result in the stronger
drag of the particles into the weak ﬁeld region, that reducing the kinetic pressure response to the magnetic ﬁeld enhancement
and supporting instability. Therefore, stronger Debye screening (larger d) would lower the instability threshold, in agreement
with the found from rigorous calculations.

From (15)–(17) it is easily seen that the growth rate is inversely proportional to κi = −π(df /dE)|vk=0, and not to the number
of particles with vk = 0 (cf. Southwood and Kivelson [16]). The latter is correct for the bi-Maxwellian distribution since
(df /dE) ∝ f in this case. For other distributions this relation may well be wrong. For example, for the waterbag distribution
(df /dE)|vk=0 = 0 and higher order terms should be retained to investigate the behavior near the threshold. It is easy to see
from (14) that in this case ¯χ = d − αG2, where α = −R v−2
k (df /dE)dvk is well-deﬁned. The dispersion relation (9) becomes
than a ﬁrst order equation for G2, which has one positive solution near the threshold. It is clear that in this case the growth rate
is determined by the whole distribution and not only by the behavior in vk = 0.

VI. HYDRODYNAMICAL REGIME

The previous analysis shows that maximum Z is always of the order of unity or larger, which means that ions no longer
respond adiabatically to the magnetic ﬁeld enhancements and their inertia begins to play an important role. This also means that
it is thermal particles of the ion distribution body with v ∼ vT ik which are mainly responsible for the instability development
and not the group of resonant particles with vk = 0. Figure 10 shows that for some distributions the instability may be very fast
so that the electron inertia should be taken into account.

The previous analysis gives a clue to the treatment of the instability in the range of maximum growth rates, where G & 1.
Let us assume that the distribution function is such that vkf (vk) has a sharp maximum at some vm ∼ vT k. An example of a
distribution of this kind is the Maxwellian fi = (1/√2πvT ik) exp(−v2
T ik) for which there was no good approximation for
¯χ in the range |Z| ∼ 1 so far. For the aperiodic mirror instability with Z = iG, G > 0, one has

¯χi = 1/(G2 + v2
Figure 10, the electron inertia should be also taken into account by substituting ¯χe = 1/(G2Rµ + v2
me). If, however, the growth
rates are relatively modest (as in other cases studied in the present paper), the electrons still respond adiabatically and ¯χe = de.
In the last case (9) turns into a third order equation with respect to G2. Finding the maximum growth rate from this equation is a
technical problem. We shall stop for a while at the physical sense of the above approximation. The dependence of the maximum
growth rate on vm indicates that the particles with high velocities v ∼ vT k are taking part in the process. This is related to
the dynamic redistribution (closely related to the dynamic Debye screening): if the potential changes quickly the low velocity
particles do not have enough time to change their position and leave the ﬁeld enhancements. This redistribution is described by
the same Eq. (25) but now γ/kkvT k ∼ 1. High velocity particles can leave these regions and reduce the kinetic pressure response
but their contribution rapidly decreases with the velocity since their number decreases. The increase of redistribution efﬁciency
and the decrease of the number of screeners with the velocity increase ﬁnds its manifestation in that the main contribution
belongs to the particles at the maximum of vkf (vk). Since the redistribution plays the destabilizing role, it can be expected that
the smaller is vm the higher is the growth rate. This can be seen already from Figure 8 where the growth rate for Lorentzian
ions, v2
m = 2 (with the same massless Maxwellian electrons).
Figure 15 shows the comparison of the growth rates obtained with the proposed approximation for several v2
m = 2 (diamonds),
1.5 (crosses), 1 (triangles), 0.5 (circles), and massless Maxwellian electrons. The parameters chosen are βi⊥ = βe⊥ = 0.5,
βik = βek. As expected the decrease of vm results in the increase of the maximum growth rate.

m = 0.5, is larger than the growth rate for the Maxwellian, v2

Finally, Figure 16 shows the comparison of the growth rates obtained directly and with the above approximation for
Maxwellian (diamonds and crosses) and Lorentzian (triangles and circles), for the same parameter set. The agreement is quite
satisfactory.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

function d =R v−1

k/2 is the parallel energy.

We have derived the most general dispersion relation for longwavelength modes in hot plasmas. We have derived the general
mirror instability condition for arbitrary ion and electron distributions and growth rate of the instability near the threshold.
The instability threshold depends not only on the plasma species β but also on another integral characteristic of the distribution
k (∂f /∂vk)dvk for both species. Larger d corresponds to smaller Debye length. Smaller Debye length, in turn,
corresponds to stronger response of the density to the perturbations of the potential, which allows stronger density depletions
in the regions of the magnetic ﬁeld enhancements. Therefore, the kinetic pressure response to the magnetic pressure buildup
weakens. Hence, the larger is d the lower is instability threshold. The near-the-threshold growth rate is inversely proportional to
∂f /∂E, where E = v2
The mirror instability is always aperiodic and (γ/kkvT ik)max ∼ 1 (and sometimes substantially greater). Maximum growth
rates are normally determined by vmi such that vk∂fi/∂vk has a sharp maximum in vk = vmi, and de (if the instability is very
strong vme takes the place of de). This is related to the dynamic redistribution in which the thermal particles participate. Growth
rates are higher for distributions with tails and lower for compact distributions (those, for which f = 0 if |vk| > v0, where v0
is some upper limit). For noncompact distributions the maximum growth rate is larger for smaller vm, which corresponds to
the weaker dynamic screening of the parallel electric ﬁeld. For the distributions analyzed in this paper the behavior of d and
vm correlates (d increases when vm decreases) since all these are single-parameter distributions. For more general distributions
the behavior of de and vm may be uncorrelated. It is also worth noting that it not, in general, any speciﬁc group of particles
which are responsible for the instability development. Compare, for example, two similar distributions (velocity normalized on
the thermal velocity vT k): f1 = (2/π)(1 + v2
k)−1 with d = 1 and
m = 1. While the behavior of the two is similar for vk = 0 and vk → ∞ (the only difference is the factor √2), the ﬁrst one is
v2
expected to be more unstable because of the three times stronger Debye screening. At the same time the behavior of the second
distribution near the threshold should be close to that of the Maxwellian, d = 1, despite the very different suprathermal tails and
(df /dE)|vk=0.
We have also proposed a useful approximation for the dielectric function in the range G/kkvT ik & 1 for distributions with
sharp maxima of vk(∂f /∂vk) (Maxwellian as one of such distributions). This approximation proves to be quite satisfactory for
Maxwellian type distributions and allows to study analytically the instability behavior in the maximum growth rate range.

m = 0.5, and f2 = (√2/π)(1 + v4

k)−2 with d = 3 and v2

APPENDIX C: APERIODIC NATURE OF THE MIRROR INSTABILITY

In order to show that the mirror instability is aperiodic we analyze the behavior of the roots of (9) when the β parameters
are changed. In the waterbag case the transition from the stable to the unstable regimes occurs when W = 0, G = 0 and for
the mode whose phase velocity is less than the highest particle velocity, Re Z < vk,max (“subparticle” mode), that is, in the
resonant region. In the general case, where Landau damping is nonzero, in the resonant range every propagating wave having
W 6= 0 has also nonzero damping rate G < 0 (we assume that there are no other kinetic instabilities in the mirror-stable
region). By continuously changing the plasma parameters (e.g., the anisotropy ratio β⊥/βk) we can bring the system into the
unstable regime. Assuming continuous dependence of W and G on the plasma parameters we see that it is impossible for the
“subparticle” mode with W 6= 0 to transform into the unstable mode, since G < 0 and cannot be made positive continuously.
Thus, the only way to do that is to go through W = 0, G = 0.
Let us now consider the vicinity of the transition to the instability, |Z| ≪ 1. In the most general way, expanding ¯χ in powers

of Z one gets:

∂f
∂v⊥

¯χ =Z

(C1)

provided (∂f /∂vk)|vk=0 6= 0. The quantities d and κ are deﬁned in (14). It is easy to see that (9) is the ﬁrst order equation
for iZ (with real coefﬁcients) in the lowest order on |Z| ≪ 1, which means that there is a simple (one and only one) aperiodic
root in the vicinity of Z = 0. Such aperiodic solutions cannot be converted into non-aperiodic ones by continuous change of the
plasma parameters, for the same reason as above. Therefore, the unstable solutions must be aperiodic.

The function Ψ(Z), deﬁned in (9), is an analytical function of Z = W + iG and a continuous function of its parameters
β and θ. Let us consider how Z moves from the lower half-plane (stable regime) to the upper half-plane (unstable regime)
with the change of β and θ = const. The transition to instability occurs, in general, in the vicinity of Z = 0 where Ψ(Z) =
Ψ(0) + (dΨ/dZ)|Z=0Z = A + BZ (see sec. V). In the transition point A = 0. Using (15)–(17) it is easy to show that in the
transition point B > 0 (provided κ > 0, this condition being violated if ∂f /∂E > 0 at vk = 0, corresponding to the regime
of two-hump instability), so that in the vicinity of the transition point A > 0 corresponds to the stable regime, while A < 0
corresponds to the instability. Because of the continuity, in the whole instability range A < 0.

Let us show now that (9) always has a solution Z = iG, G > 0 in the unstable range. Indeed, Ψ(0) < 0 as is shown above.

On the other hand, if G → ∞ one has χ → 1/G2 and Ψ(∞) > 0. This means that there exists G > 0 such that Ψ(G) = 0.
In the absence of kinetic instabilities, in the stable regime all roots of (9) with nonzero W are either in the lower half-plane
(Landau damping or nonpropagation) or at the real axis (if (∂f /∂vk)|vk=W = 0). In the ﬁrst case no root can cross the real axis
except at W = 0, when the parameters are changed continuously to bring the system in the unstable regime. As can be seen
from (15)–(17) there is only one root crossing the real axis at this point, provided ∂f /∂E < 0. Therefore, there is only one root
in the upper half-plane and it is purely imaginary.
If ∂f /∂E = 0 there are two or more roots in the vicinity of Z = 0 (depending on the behavior of f ) but only one is positive,
G > 0. Since in this case the analytical continuation through Z = 0 into the lower half-plane is straightforward (no pole at
vk = 0) other roots correspond to damping solutions, and there is again only one root in the upper half-plane.

Finally, let us consider the case where there are roots with G = 0 and W = W0 6= 0. Such situation can occur when
(∂f /∂vk) = 0 in isolated points or in an interval (as for the compact waterbag and hard-bell). In the ﬁrst case the imaginary part
of Z is negative for W close to W0, so that the continuous change of parameters does not bring the root to the upper half-plane.
In the second case the continuous change of parameters leaves the root on the real axis until it enters the range where

(∂f /∂vk) 6= 0 or W = 0.

Abstract.
Experimental results from Tromsø HF pumping experiments in the nightside
auroral E region are reported. We found intriguing evidence that a modiﬁcation of
the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling, due to the effects of powerful HF waves
beamed into an auroral sporadic E layer, can lead to a local intensiﬁcation of
the auroral activity. Summarizing multi-instrument ground-based observations,
one can distinguish the following peculiarities related to this auroral activation:
modiﬁcation of the auroral arc and its break-up above Tromsø; local changes of the
horizontal currents in the vicinity of Tromsø; increase of the electron temperature
and ion velocities at altitudes above the HF pump reﬂection level; distinctive
features in dynamic HF radio scatter Doppler spectra; pump-induced electron
precipitation; substorm activation exactly above Tromsø. The mechanisms of the
modiﬁcation of the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling through the excitation of
the turbulent boundary layer between the base of the ionosphere (∼ 100 km) and
the level of sharp increase of the Alfvén velocity (∼> 1000 km), and the formation
of a local magnetospheric current system are discussed. The results suggest
that a possible triggering of local auroral activation requires speciﬁc geophysical
conditions.

Introduction

Field-aligned currents (FACs) play an important rôle
in the process of energy transfer between the magneto-
sphere and the ionosphere. They establish the force bal-
ance between the hot, tenuous plasma of the magnetosphere
and the cold, dense plasma of the ionosphere [Haerendel,
1990]. Important agents in the magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling are Alfvén waves, since they are equivalent to time-
varying ﬁeld-aligned currents. It has been suggested that the
static coupling is dominant for large-scale magnetosphere-
ionosphere coupling, while the Alfvén wave coupling is
dominant for small-scale coupling [Nagatsuma et al., 1996].
One of the most remarkable manifestations of the dy-
namic processes in the solar wind-magnetosphere-iono-
sphere system is the substorm phenomenon.
It is known
that a magnetospheric substorm involves two components:
the directly driven component, and the energy storage re-
lease part. The driven system responds directly to changes in
the interplanetary medium (IMF orientation, solar wind pres-
sure) and involves the direct deposition of solar wind energy
into the auroral ionosphere and the symmetric ring currents.
The storage-release system pertains to the process of storage

of energy in the tail magnetic ﬁeld and in the kinetic drift of
the magnetotail particles. After that it is explosively released
into the auroral ionosphere and symmetric ring current sys-
tem [Rostoker et al., 1987; Rostoker, 1999]. As pointed out
by Rostoker [1999] the progress of the substorm may be pro-
duced by either the more global, directly driven process or a
more localized, storage-release process and may be looked
at either on a global scale or on a local scale.

During a substorm onset, the large-scale laminar mag-
netospheric convection is disrupted because the magneto-
spheric cross-tail current is diverted down the magnetic ﬁeld
lines [McPherron et al., 1973]. This leads to the activation
of the substorm current loop, the so-called substorm cur-
rent wedge [Kamide and Baumjohann, 1993; Rostoker et al.,
1987]. Boström [1964] proposed two auroral current sys-
tems connected to the auroral electrojet. This model has not
only remained valid up to present time, but also comprises
most suggestions made later on.

Mechanisms for the triggering of the substorm activity
could be several in number and both internal and external
to the magnetosphere. However, the triggering process is
thought to be stochastic in nature [Rostoker et al., 1987; Ros-
toker, 1998, 1999; Samson et al., 1996].

In recent times, the possibility of triggering magneto-
spheric substorms by artiﬁcial impacts has been discussed.
The artiﬁcial localization of a magnetospheric substorm by

2

strong HF radio beams was considered by Mogilevsky [1999],
based on measurements onboard the INTERBALL-2 (Au-
roral probe) satellite. From a consideration of results of
active experiments, Foster [1998] concluded that substorm
onsets may be initiated by such actions. Experimental re-
sults concerning artiﬁcial modiﬁcation of the ionosphere-
magnetosphere system were presented by Blagoveshchen-
skaya et al. [1998a, 1999] and Kornienko et al. [1999].

In this paper we report experimental results from Tromsø
HF pumping experiments in the nightside auroral E region
and present evidence for a modiﬁcation, produced by pow-
erful HF radio waves, of the ionosphere-magnetosphere cou-
pling, leading to a local intensiﬁcation of the auroral activ-
ity. Data from bistatic HF Doppler radio scatter, the IMAGE
magnetometer network, the EISCAT UHF radar, the Tromsø
dynasonde, and the digital all-sky imager (DASI) were used
in the analysis.

Experimental methods and equipment used

The experiments reported here were conducted by us-
ing the EISCAT HF heating facility [Rietveld et al., 1993]
located near Tromsø (geographical coordinates 69.6◦N,
19.2◦E, L = 6.2, magnetic dip angle I = 78◦) in the pre-
midnight hours of February 16 and 17, 1996. The Tromsø
heater was operating at the frequency 4040 kHz, O-mode
polarization, with a 4 min on/6 min off pump cycle, and an
effective radiated power of 150 MW. The antenna beam was
tilted 6◦ to the south, thus allowing HF pumping in a near
ﬁeld-aligned direction.

Bistatic scatter measurements of HF diagnostic signals
were carried out on the London–Tromsø–St. Petersburg path
at operational frequencies of 9410 and 12, 095 kHz. The
analysis of the received diagnostic waves, scattered from
artiﬁcial ﬁeld-aligned irregularities (AFAIs) above Tromsø,
was made with a Doppler spectral method in St. Petersburg
at a distance of about 1200 km; the receiving antenna was di-
rected toward Tromsø. The geometry of the experiments is
shown in Figure 1. Spectral processing of the diagnostic sig-
nals was made with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method.
On the 16 and 17 February, the frequency bandwidth used
was 50 and 33 Hz, respectively, with a frequency resolution
of about 0.1 Hz and a temporal resolution of about 10 s.

To facilitate the interpretation of the Doppler measure-
ments, we used data from the IMAGE magnetometer net-
work [Lühr et al., 1996]. The locations of the IMAGE mag-
netometers are depicted in Figure 1. The time resolution of
the IMAGE magnetometers used in this study was 10 s.

Optical data were obtained with the digital all-sky imager
(DASI). Details of the instrumentation can be found in the
work by Kosch et al. [1998]. The DASI is located at Ski-
botn, near Tromsø (69.3◦N, 20.4◦E). In this study we used
557.7 nm data with 10 s and 30 s temporal resolution.

To obtain information about possible changes of the elec-
tron temperatures, Te, and ion velocities, Vi, due to the
HF pumping, EISCAT UHF radar measurements at Tromsø

Tromsø (TRO; 69.66◦N, 18.94◦E), Masi (MAS; 69.46◦N,
23.70◦E), Muonio (MUO; 68.02◦N, 23.53◦E), Pello (PEL;
66.90◦N, 24.08◦E), Hankasalmi (HAN; 62.30◦N, 26.65◦E),
Kevo (KEV; 69.76◦N, 17.01◦E), and Lovozero (LOZ;
67.97◦N, 22.22◦E).

were also employed.

Observational results

The Tromsø dynasonde ionograms as well as the altitude-
temporal variations of the electron density measured by the
EISCAT UHF radar in course of the Tromsø pumping exper-
iments on February 16 and 17, 1996, show the presence of an
intense sporadic Es layer with a maximum plasma frequency
of 4.1 ≤ f0Es ≤ 4.5 MHz at heights 110 ≤ hmEs ≤ 130 km.
We therefore conclude that the E region of the auroral iono-
sphere was actually the region where the powerful HF radio
waves were reﬂected. This led to the generation of artiﬁ-

cial ﬁeld-aligned irregularities (AFAIs) which scattered the 9
and 12 MHz signals used for Doppler diagnostics. It should
be noted that, under the speciﬁc conditions when the pump
waves are reﬂected from auroral Es layers, the pump reﬂec-
tion height is close to the altitude of the heater-enhanced
conductivity region which coincides with the auroral elec-
trojet; see the review article by Stubbe [1996] and references
therein.

Experiment on February 17, 1996

The experiment on February 17, 1996, was conducted
from 20 to 22 UT. A very interesting observation in this ex-
periment is the behavior of the auroral arc in the vicinity of
Tromsø during the heating cycle 20:30-20:34 UT; see the
DASI data in Plate 1. Beginning at 20:32 UT (third row
in Plate 1), a gradual thinning of the auroral arc, accompa-
nied by the appearance of a weak bulge above Tromsø, is
observed. At 20:33.40 UT a break-up of the arc took place
exactly above Tromsø.

The magnetic ﬁeld X, Y , and Z components, as recorded
by the NAL, HOR, BJN, SOR, TRO, MAS, MUO, PEL, and
HAN stations of the IMAGE magnetometer network, are dis-
played in Figure 2; cf. also Figure 1. It can be seen that a
substorm activation started at 20:00 UT. A second activation
started at 20:33 UT, indicated by a large negative spike in
the magnetic X component, localized in a narrow latitudinal
region around Tromsø, from the SOR to the MAS station.

Examination of the peculiarities in the behavior of the
X and Z magnetic components in Figure 2 shows that a
new westward electrojet appeared at 20:33 UT exactly above

Tromsø (reversal of the Z component from positive values at
SOR to negative values at MAS, with Z ≈ 0 at the TRO sta-
tion, and maximal negative amplitude of the X component
(Xmax = −130 nT at Tromsø). Thereafter, at 20:38 UT, a
large substorm started at higher latitudes (Xmax = −400 nT
at the HOR station). We will only consider the substorm
activation around Tromsø which started at 20:33 UT.

The behavior of the equivalent current vectors (from the
X and Y magnetic components in Figure 2), describing
the distribution of the magnetic disturbances from 20:29 to
20:36 UT, is summarized in Figure 5. It is clearly seen that
the most drastic changes of the current directions and magni-
tudes in the vicinity of Tromsø from SOR to MAS occurred
during the period 20:33-20:34 UT.

Studies of magnetograms from the Kevo (Figure 3) and
Lovozero (Figure 4) stations, which are both located fur-
ther east of Tromsø, clearly show that a westward traveling
surge explanation of our data can be ruled out and that we
can safely conclude that the substorm really occurred above
Tromsø.

Figure 6 presents dynamic Doppler spectra of HF diag-
nostic signals recorded in St. Petersburg in the course of two
heating cycles from 20:18 to 20:38 UT. The turning on of the
Tromsø heater at 20:20 UT led to the appearance of an addi-
tional track, shifted from the direct signal by about −2.5 Hz.
This additional track did not disappear until several seconds
after the heater was turned off at 20:24 UT and was produced
by diagnostic waves scattered from the artiﬁcial ﬁeld-aligned
irregularities (AFAIs) generated by the Tromsø HF heating
facility in the auroral E region. It is believed [Djuth et al.,

1985; Noble et al., 1987] that a thermal resonance instability
at the UH level is the strongest candidate for the excitation
of AFAIs in the E region.

As can also be seen from Figure 6, the heater turn-on at
20:30 UT led to the appearance of ﬁeld-aligned scattered HF
signals in the same manner as in the preceding heating cy-

cle. About 60 s later, wide-band spectral feature occurred
throughout the spectral bandwidth analyzed. Thereafter, at
20:33 UT, an additional very intense, short-lived track of
about 1 min duration, displaced −0.8 Hz from the main scat-
tered signal, appeared in the Doppler sonogram. The heater
turn-off at 20:34 UT was followed by the disappearance of

the additional short-lived track, but the AFAI scattered sig-
nals, as well as the wide-band spectral features, were main-
tained for yet another minute.

It is known that one of the common features in HF pump-
ing experiments is the generation of Stimulated Electromag-
netic Emissions (SEE) [Thidé et al., 1982, 1983; Thidé,
1990]. The SEE sidebands are asymmetric with a very dis-
tinct and systematic behaviour which depends sensitively
on the ratio between the pump and the gyroharmonic fre-
quencies. A particularly pronounced SEE component is one
which is downshifted from the pump frequency fpump by the
lower-hybrid frequency fLH. This downshifted maximum,
often referred to the ‘DM’ feature and covering a range of
frequencies at or below fDM = fpump − fLH, has been stud-
ied experimentally in great detail and may for instance be
used for estimating the local magnetic ﬁeld and its varia-
tions in the region of pump-ionosphere interaction [Thidé
et al., 1982, 1983, 1989; Stubbe et al., 1984; Leyser et al.,
1989, 1992, 1994].

In our 17 February experiment the operational frequency
( f = 12, 095 kHz) used in the HF Doppler measurements

Figure 6. Dynamic Doppler spectra of HF diagnostic signals

frequency 12, 095 kHz on February 17, 1996, from 20:18
to 20:38 UT. The direct signals propagating from the trans-
mitter to the receiver along a great circle path correspond to
zero Doppler shifts. The intervals when the Tromsø heater
was turned on are marked on the time axis.

happened to coincide with the third harmonic of the down-
f = 3 fDM = 3( fpump − fLH), where
shifted maximum,
fpump = 4040 kHz and fLH ≈ 8 kHz (in the ionosphere above
Tromsø). Because of this, and the fact that harmonics of the
‘DM’ component have been identiﬁed by Blagoveshchen-
skaya et al. [1998b] in other HF pumping experiments, it
is intriguing to assume that the wide-band spectral feature in
the Doppler sonogram is due to the 3 fDM component of the
SEE spectra. However, the large decay time of about one
minute after the HF heater turn-off, seems to indicates that
the heater-related wide-band spectral feature in Figure 6 is
probably not related to (a harmonic of) the usual SEE ‘DM’
component. Unfortunately, no SEE diagnostics capability
was available during the experiments so it was not possible
to establish directly whether the basic SEE ‘DM’ component
was excited or not.

The long-delayed effect of the wide-band feature ob-
served is not clear. Because of this we do not exclude the
possibility that this heater-related emission in our experi-
ment is a heater-modiﬁed natural auroral emission in the
decameter range [LaBelle et al., 1995; Weatherwax et al.,
1995].

Another possible explanation is that the observed heater-

The spatial scale of each plot is the same as in Figure 1. The plot time is 30 s. The Tromsø heater was turned on from 21:20
to 21:24 UT and 21:30 to 21:34 UT.

related wide-band features are accompanied by the excita-
tion of VLF waves and turbulence which are known to be
excited in ionospheric HF pumping. As was concluded by
Vas’kov et al. [1998] from satellite experiments during the
action of un-modulated powerful HF radio waves on the
nightside ionospheric F region, VLF waves may be excited
due to a decay process taking place near the pump wave re-
ﬂection region, or due to the interaction with suprathermal
electrons, accelerated by the pump-enhanced plasma turbu-
lence. The heater induced VLF waves can be studied by
ground-based techniques. On the other hand, HF-excited
VLF waves in the whistler mode were detected by satellites
in the upper ionosphere and magnetosphere within the mag-
netic ﬂux tube footprinted on the heating facility [Vas’kov
et al., 1998].

Closely related to the wide-band spectral features in the
probe wave sidebands was the appearance of an additional
short-lived track in the Doppler sonogram. It is likely that
this short-lived track was induced by a stimulated precipita-
tion of electrons due to a cyclotron resonant interaction of
natural precipitating electrons with heater-induced whistler
waves in the magnetosphere [Trefall et al., 1975; Bösinger
et al., 1996; Trakthengerts, 1999]. From the results obtained,
we may then conclude that the substorm activation on Febru-
ary 17, 1996, at 20:33 UT exactly above Tromsø was initi-
ated by the pump-induced electron precipitation.

Another interesting peculiarity, detected in the EISCAT
UHF radar data, is the occurrence of a burst-like increase
of the electron temperature Te up to 2000 K and of the ion
velocity Vi in a wide range of altitudes from 190 to 440 km

during the heating cycle 20:30–20:34 UT while the HF pump
wave was reﬂected from the height hmEs, located somewhere
in the 110–130 km altitude range. Hence, the increase in Te
and Vi were observed at heights above the pump wave re-
ﬂection level.
It is well known that HF pump wave may
excite plasma waves and turbulence in the resonant region
where the ordinary mode (O-mode) of the pump wave is
reﬂected from the ionosphere and in the UH resonance re-
gion. The threshold ﬁeld strength for the generation, due to
ponderomotive force effects, of plasma waves by the a pow-
erful O-mode radio wave is of the order Eth ≈ 200 mV/m
[Fejer, 1979; Thidé, 1990], a value which was signiﬁcantly
exceeded in our experiments. As was pointed out by Fe-
jer [1979], partial pressure effects can lower this threshold.
In these processes, the electrons are assumed to be accel-
erated and this leads to an electron ﬂux transport along the
magnetic ﬁeld lines [Bernhardt et al., 1988]. Note that the
observed changes in the Te an Vi are closely correlated with
the substorm activation and may therefore be a signature of
heater-induced precipitation of electrons.

Summarizing the experimental ﬁndings from the differ-
ent ground-based measurements during the heater-on period
20:30–20:34 UT on February 17, one can distinguish the
following peculiarities related to the auroral activation ob-
served after 30 minutes from the start of the heating exper-
iment: (a) modiﬁcation of the auroral arc and its break-up
above Tromsø; (b) local changes of the horizontal currents
in the E region; (c) generation of scattered Doppler compo-
nents throughout the whole spectral bandwidth of 33 Hz an-
alyzed; (d) appearance of an additional short-lived Doppler

to scattered diagnostic signals due to pump-induced electron
precipitation; (e) increase of Te and Vi at heights ranging
from 190 to 440 km; (f) substorm activation exactly above
Tromsø.

Experiment on February 16, 1996

In this section we present data from the Tromsø HF
pumping experiment carried out on February 16, 1996, start-
ing at 21:00 UT. The DASI digital all-sky imager data for
this day (Plate 2) show that the latitude-oriented auroral arc
was located slightly to the south of the heater. It should be
pointed out that a most remarkable optical phenomenon was
observed during the two heating cycles 21:20-21:24 UT and
21:30-21:34 UT. As can be seen in Plate 2, a development
of local spiral-like forms in the auroral arc near Tromsø oc-
curred after the heater was turned on. In the ﬁrst case (21:20-
21:24 UT), the spiral form appeared at 21:21.30 UT and led
to the start of an auroral activation. In course of the heater-
on period the intensity of this spiral increased and started to
decay only after the heater was turned off.
In the second
case (21:30–21:34 UT), a similar form, but more intense in
comparison with the heater-on period 21:20–21:24 UT, ap-
peared at 21:31 UT. Furthermore, at 21:33.30 UT (Plate 2,
fourth row, last panel) the spiral was broken up exactly above

Tromsø. Such a spiral form can be attributed to the local ap-
pearance of ﬁeld-aligned currents during the heater-on peri-
ods 21:20-21:24 UT and 21:30-21:34 UT.

IMAGE magnetograms for the event on February 16,
1996 (X, Y , and Z magnetic components) are displayed in
Figure 7. These magnetic data indicate that the Tromsø
heater operation started under quiet magnetic conditions
(from 21:00 UT) and that the start of the substorm oc-
curred at 21:21 UT during the third heating cycle (21:20–
21:24 UT). It should be noted that this event, just as the sub-
storm activation on February 17, 1996, occurred in a narrow
latitudinal region localized around Tromsø. This is evident
from the behavior of the equivalent current vectors obtained
from the IMAGE magnetometers from 21:19 to 21:27 UT
(Figure 8). Moreover, the most drastic changes of the current
directions and magnitudes were also observed in the vicin-
ity of Tromsø, ranging in latitude from the SOR to the MAS
magnetic stations.

Figure 9 displays the dynamic Doppler spectra obtained
on February 16, 1996, from 20:58 to 21:40 UT, on the
London–Tromsø–St. Petersburg path, for a radio scatter op-
erational frequency of f = 9410 kHz. One can see that the
heater turn-on at 21:10 UT led to the appearance of a weak
scattered signal shifted from the direct signal (correspond-
ing to zero Doppler shift) by about +6.3 Hz. Note that the

on are marked on the time axis.

Doppler frequency fd of the scattered signal changed during
this heater-on period with a maximum magnitude of 2.2 Hz.
When the heater was turned off at 21:14 UT, the scattered
signals did not disappear as was the case on February 17,
1996. Up to 21:34 UT, intense scattered signals from natural
Es irregularities were observed in St. Petersburg.

The spectral structure of the signals scattered from AFAIs
is quite complicated. It includes a broadening of the Doppler
spectra and burst-like noise enhancements. The variations of
fd with time of the broad part in the dynamic Doppler spectra
can be correlated with the movements of the auroral arcs in
the vicinity of Tromsø on the line of sight of the radio scatter

Recently, new electron gyroharmonic effects in coherent
HF resonant scatter from pump-excited AFAIs in the day-

experiments described in the present paper, we operated in
an auroral Es layer and at an HF pump frequency which was
estimated to be somewhat below the third electron gyrohar-
monic. An ideal means for determining the precise relation
between the HF pump frequency and a gyroharmonic is pro-
vided by SEE [Leyser et al., 1992, 1994]. As was mentioned
above, no SEE diagnostic was available during our experi-
ments.

Similar to the event of February 17, 1996, we observed
in the EISCAT UHF radar data an increase of the electron
temperature Te of up to 2400 K in the altitude range from
160–420 km. Also, increased ion velocities closely corre-
lated with the heater-on periods 21:20-21:24 UT and 21:30-
21:34 UT were observed. This conﬁrms the presence of an
electron ﬂux transport along the magnetic ﬁeld lines.

From the experimental data from the period 21:20-
21:24 UT on February 16, 1996, one can identify the fol-
lowing speciﬁc features, which may be related to the auroral
activation observed after 20 minutes from the start of the HF

Discussion

A bistatic HF Doppler radio scattering setup has been
used in conjunction with the IMAGE magnetometer net-
work, the DASI digital all-sky imager, the Tromsø dyna-
sonde, and the EISCAT UHF radar to ﬁnd evidence that
powerful HF radio waves can cause the modiﬁcation of the
ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling which can lead to a lo-
cal intensiﬁcation of the auroral activity. Results obtained
from ground-based observations made on two consecutive
days can be interpreted as auroral activations localized over
the Tromsø HF heating facility. A distinctive feature of
the experiments reported here is that the HF pump waves
were reﬂected from an auroral Es layer. This means that
the plasma resonance level was close to the altitude of the
heater-enhanced conductivity region.

During the experiments, local changes of the ionospheric
conductivities, and therefore currents in the magnetic ﬂux
tube footprinted at Tromsø, were observed. Very drastic lo-
cal horizontal current changes, closely correlated with au-
roral activations during the heater-on periods, were seen in
the behavior of the equivalent current vectors obtained from
the X and Y magnetic ﬁeld components obtained by the IM-
AGE magnetometer network (see Figures 5 and 8). It is quite
possible that the region of the heater-enhanced ionospheric
conductivity was polarized in the background electric ﬁeld
and the polarization electric ﬁeld propagated into the mag-
netosphere along the magnetic ﬁeld lines as the ﬁeld of an
outgoing Alfvén wave [Lyatsky and Maltsev, 1983; Kan and
Sun, 1985; Lysak, 1990; Borisov et al., 1996; Kozlovsky and
Lyatsky, 1997]. However, other, non-linear processes may
also have contributed to the effects observed.

Another phenomenon which accompanied the auroral ac-
tivations, was the appearance of wide-band spectral features
in the Doppler radio scattering data. There are grounds to
assume that these spectral features may be associated with
pump-induced VLF and ELF noise. Note that these spectral
features were observed when the Tromsø heating facility op-
erated in the 4 min on/6 min off mode, which is a frequency
which is signiﬁcantly lower than that of the the waves ex-
cited. Therefore, the VLF and ELF noise in our experiments
is not the same as the well known effect of ELF and VLF ex-
citation at combination frequencies [Getmantsev et al., 1974;
Rietveld et al., 1989]. The emissions observed have other

propagating into the topside ionosphere over large distances
excited by un-modulated HF pump waves were identiﬁed for
the ﬁrst time by Vas’kov et al. [1998] in satellite experiments.

It is thought that on February 17, 1996, VLF waves at the
harmonics of the lower hybrid frequency were generated by
the 150 MW ERP HF waves from the Tromsø heating fa-
cility. These VLF waves propagated, in the whistler mode,
along the Tromsø magnetic ﬁeld line into the upper iono-
sphere. Their interaction with natural precipitation electrons
due to a cyclotron resonance, led to a pump-induced precip-
itation of electrons responsible for the occurrence of addi-
tional short-lived track on the Doppler sonogram (see Fig-
ure 6). From the results obtained we conclude that a sub-
storm activation exactly above Tromsø at 20:33 UT was ini-
tiated by the pump-induced precipitation of the electrons.

On February 16, 1996, the noise enhancement occurred
over a frequency range of up to 35 Hz, which is below the ion
cyclotron frequency. We emphasize that the Doppler mea-
surements in this modiﬁcation experiment were performed
in a limited frequency bandwidth of 50 Hz. At frequencies
below the ion cyclotron frequency the only known electro-
magnetic modes of propagation along magnetic ﬁeld lines
is the torsional Alfvén mode. Thus one would expect that
Alfvén waves would be excited by the HF pumping of the
night-side auroral E region. Alfvén waves associated with
ELF noise are identiﬁed with electric to magnetic ﬁeld ra-
tios of the order of the Alfvén velocity. These waves are
observed to occur in narrow regions typically of the order 1–
3 km and have highly irregular wave forms [Gurnett et al.,
1984].

It is believed that Alfvén wave generation during HF
pump experiments provides a possibility for the excitation
of the ionospheric Alfvén resonator (IAR) which is bounded
from the bottom by the ionospheric E region, and from the
top by the region of sharp increase of Alfvén velocities at
heights up to one Earth radius. Trakhtengerts and Feldstein
[1991] developed a theory of the formation of the turbulent
boundary layer (TBL) in the ionospheric Alfvén resonator.
The TBL consists of small-scale Alfvén vortices (l ∼ 1–
3 km) trapped inside IARs. The accumulation of energy
in the magnetospheric tail is accompanied by the increase
of the laminar magnetospheric convection which, under spe-
ciﬁc geophysical conditions, can turn into a turbulent state.
This mechanism would come into play through the local
“switch-on” of the TBL in the selected magnetic ﬂux tube
footprinted at Tromsø.

It should be noted that the ampliﬁcation of the interaction
between the magnetospheric convection and the ionospheric
base is induced by accelerated electrons. What accelerator
mechanisms can be caused by HF pumping of the base of the
ionosphere at ∼ 100 km? It is known [Bernhardt et al., 1988]
that electrons are accelerated by the electric potential asso-
ciated with plasma waves excited by HF pump waves at the
plasma and upper hybrid resonance levels. This leads to an
electron ﬂux transport along the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Ohmic
heating increases the electron temperature Te and the plasma
pressure in the modiﬁed ionosphere. An increase of the Te
at heights from 160 to 420 km can be clearly distinguished
in the EISCAT UHF radar data. Therefore, one can con-

10

clude that electrons are being transported out of the heated
region. HF pumping may also lead to other possible acceler-
ator mechanisms which also occur in the naturally disturbed
auroral ionosphere: lower hybrid wave Landau resonance,
kinetic Alfvén waves, and anomalous resistivity [Borovsky,
1993].

The local “switch on” of the turbulent boundary layer
may promote the formation of a local magnetospheric cur-
rent system. This would consist of two ﬁeld-aligned sheet
currents on the northward and southward sides of the heater-
modiﬁed auroral E region closed via Pedersen currents in
the ionosphere. The conﬁguration of this current system is
similar to the second conﬁguration (Type II) of Boström’s
model [Boström, 1964] with driving forces inside this sys-
tem. In addition, it drives a Hall current. The formation of
a local magnetospheric current system is conﬁrmed by the
behavior and features of the auroral arc near Tromsø. From
optical data obtained during heater-on periods, the appear-
ance of the local spiral-like or bulge structures in the auroral
arcs, typical for the region of the ﬁeld-aligned currents, can
be clearly identiﬁed in the vicinity of Tromsø (Plates 2 and
7).

Summary

Experimental results from multi-instrument observations
during Tromsø HF pumping experiments in the night-side
auroral E region indicate that phenomena, analogous to
those occurring naturally during auroral activations, were
created by powerful HF radio waves transmitted from the
Tromsø heating facility. The modiﬁcation of the ionosphere-
magnetosphere coupling leading to the local intensiﬁcation
of the auroral activity may be attributed to the following
facts:

1. The transmitted O-mode “heater” waves reﬂected from
the auroral E region may give rise to an increase of the
ionospheric conductivity in the HF pump-modiﬁed E
region and electron acceleration along the magnetic
ﬁeld lines. As a consequence, there will be an abrupt
increase of the conductivity along the magnetic ﬂux
tube footprinted at Tromsø.

2. Excitation of a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) can
take place under speciﬁc geophysical conditions. The
TBL consists of small-scale (l ∼ 1–3 km) Alfvén vor-
tices trapped inside an ionospheric Alfvén resonator
which is bounded from the bottom by the HF pump
modiﬁed E region and from the top by the region of
sharp increase in the Alfvén velocity at altitudes up to
one Earth radius. The local “switch on” of the TBL in
the selected magnetic tube can turn the laminar mag-
netospheric convection into a turbulent state.

3. The local “switch on” of the TBL may promote the
formation of a local magnetospheric current system.
It consists of two ﬁeld-aligned sheet currents on the
northward and southward sides of the heater-modiﬁed

auroral E region, closed via Pedersen currents in the
ionosphere.

4. The triggering of local auroral activations by HF pump
waves requires speciﬁc geophysical conditions, viz.,
the presence of the accumulation of energy in the mag-
netospheric tail. The accumulation of energy is ac-
companied by an increase of the laminar convection
which manifests itself in the growth of the electric
ﬁeld, formation of the auroral electrojet, etc. In this
manner the energy source for the auroral activations
remains the interaction between the solar wind and the
magnetosphere.

We conclude that the experimental results presented here
provide intriguing evidence that the injection of a powerful
HF radio beam into an auroral sporadic E layer may cause
the triggering of substorms. Therefore, further experiments
of the same character are called for.

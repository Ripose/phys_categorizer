The isotropic-to-nematic transition in an athermal solution of long rigid rods subject to a grav-
itational (or centrifugal) ﬁeld is theoretically considered in the Onsager approximation. The new
feature emerging in the presence of gravity is a concentration gradient which coupled with the
nematic ordering. For rodlike molecules this eﬀect becomes noticeable at centrifugal acceleration
g ∼ 103 ÷ 104 m/s2, while for biological rodlike objects, such as tobacco mosaic virus, TMV, the
eﬀect is important even for normal gravitational acceleration conditions. Rods are concentrated
near the bottom of the vessel which sometimes leads to gravity induced nematic ordering. The
concentration range corresponding to phase separation increases with increasing g. In the region of
phase separation the local rod concentration, as well as the order parameter, follow a step function
with height.

INTRODUCTION

Nematic ordering in a solution of long rigid rods has been studied theoretically in many papers, starting from
the classical papers by Onsager [1] and Flory [2]. However, there is one aspect of this problem, which has never
been considered, namely that this transition always occurs in a gravitational ﬁeld. This ﬁeld induces a concentration
inhomogeneity within the volume where nematic ordering takes place. Such inhomogeneity should, in principle, change
some of the characteristics of the liquid-crystalline transition.

ultracentrifuge which can be 104

of the inﬂuence of gravitational ﬁeld on the nematic ordering in the solution of rigid rods seems to be an important
problem. This problem is solved theoretically below in the Onsager approximation.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

The Onsager approach is based on a virial expansion of the free energy of the solution of rigid rods taking into

account steric repulsion only.

Let us choose the Cartesian coordinate system in such a way that the external ﬁeld acts in the z direction and put
the origin of coordinates at the bottom of the reservoir (z=0). Further, let us divide the volume of the vessel V into
large number of identical layers aligned perpendicularly to the ﬁeld in order that all particles in a given layer has the
same gravitational potential. Here we use the following notation: dNz (Ω) = Nzfz (Ω) dΩ is the number of rods in
the layer z with axis directions within the small spatial angle dΩ, Nz is the total number of rods in the layer z, and
ζ = z/h denotes the dimensionless height. Let fz (Ω) be one-particle orientational distribution function of rods in the
layer z. The normalization for the function fz (Ω) is written in the familiar form

fz (Ω) dΩ = 1.

With such division of the volume of the vessel into very large number of layers, the local rod concentration C′(ζ)
has the same value within the layer. Thus, for a given layer one can apply the traditional Onsager theory [1], [8, 9]
justiﬁed for homogeneous system. This theory is valid for dilute enough solutions of very long rods.

To obtain the equilibrium distribution function we should take into account the possibility of the formation of a
phase boundary between the nematic phase at the bottom of the vessel and isotropic phase on top. We denote the
height of the boundary position in the vessel as ζ = x, so the volumes occupied by the nematic and isotropic phases
are Va = xV and Vi = (1

To calculate the equilibrium distribution function f (Ω, ζ) one should minimize the functional (5) with respect to
this function. The direct minimization of functional (5) leads to a nonlinear integral equation, which can be solved
only numerically [10, 11]. In the case where the volume of the vessel consists of two phases separated by a phase
boundary, one should realize that f (Ω, ζ) follows a step function with the variation of ζ with the function fa(Ω, ζ) in
the anisotropic part signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that in the isotropic phase fi(ζ) = 1/4π. To evaluate the distribution
function fa (Ω, ζ) in the nematic phase we apply an approximate variational method with a trial function depending
on variational parameter α.

Substituting this function in eqs. (5), (6), (7) and minimizing with respect to α(ζ), we have the following equation

However, the trial function proposed by Onsager [1] f (Ω, α) = (α/(4π sinh Θ)) cosh (α cos Θ), where Θ is the angular
deviation of a rod from the director, still leads to rather complicated integral equation. Therefore, following [9] for
the sake of simplicity we used a trial function of simpler form

The numerical solution of eqs. (26) gives the values of average dimensionless concentrations of the nematic and
isotropic phases, Ca and Ci, coexisting at equilibrium. The phase diagram in the variables average rod concentration
C – dimensionless parameter β is shown in Fig. 1. This diagram has three main regions. In the region labeled by
letter I, entire solution of rods is isotropic (corresponding height of the boundary x = 0). In the region between
the curves of coexistence Ci(β) and Ca(β), the solution is separated in the isotropic and nematic phases with an
interphase boundary between them (0 < x < 1). In the region designated by letter N , the entire volume of the vessel
is occupied by the nematic phase (x = 1).

This diagram reveals that gravity facilitates formation of the nematic phase (at least at the bottom of the vessel)

and the region of phase separation becomes very broad even for rather low values of β.

Dependence of the local rod concentration on the height ζ at ﬁxed value of β is shown in Fig. 2. The concentrations
Ca(ζ) and Ci(ζ) obey the barometric distribution according to eqs. (22) and (24), respectively. The concentrations of
the nematic and isotropic phases in the boundary layer coincide with that in the absence of the ﬁeld (Ca(x) = 5.12 and
Ca(x) = 3.45 [9]). This is the case because all the rods within a given layer exhibit the same gravitational potential.
Thus, the rod concentration follows a step function with a jump at the phase boundary.

The corresponding change with height of the order parameter S(ζ) =

P2 (cos α(Ω, ζ)) f (Ω, ζ)dΩ is shown in Fig.
3. The order parameter S(ζ) in the nematic phase is overstated due to the approximate trial function of the form
(9). With increase of ζ the order parameter decreases to the value corresponding to a nematic phase coexisting with
isotropic one in the absence of gravity and then falls to zero.

R

The Onsager approximation (1) used in this paper is valid for low rod concentrations (volume fraction ϕ

0.1).
However, with increase of β the local rod concentration at the bottom of the vessel gradually increases. Thus, for
high values of β barometric distribution (22) is no longer valid.

≤

To generalize the Onsager theory for the case of high rod concentrations one can use the Parsons approximation[12],
which aims to improve the second virial coeﬃcient (11) by means of additional multiplier depending on mole fraction of
rods, as well as some others generalizations (cf. refs. [13, 14, 15, 16]). Nevertheless, the calculations with nonanalitic
distribution arising from such an approach are rather complicated and lead to additional integral equation. In most
practical cases, except sedimentation in ultracentrifuge, the values of β are not too high (e.g. for TMV β is slightly
above the unity), and traditional second virial approximation is quite justiﬁed.

The position of the phase boundary vs. β for diﬀerent values of total rod concentration is shown in Fig. 4. These
plots lead to the following conclusions. If the total rod concentration is low enough (i.e. the greater part of the vessel
Ci), the increasing gravity induces the isotropic-to-nematic transition and
is occupied by the isotropic phase, C
1 and then the shift of the
phase boundary shifts toward the top of the vessel. This process is observed until β
boundary stops, and the volume of nematic phase even slightly decreases (bottom phase is becoming denser under
gravity; solid squares). If the total rod concentration is high enough (C
Ca) the nematic phase simply shrinks
under gravity starting from the top of the vessel and the position of the phase boundary becomes gradually lower
(solid circles).

Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize the important conclusion arising from the form of Fig. 1. The right
branch of the plot rises very rapidly as β gets large, thus, remaining within the framework of general concepts dealing
with spatially homogeneous phases one could suggest that the concentration of rods in the nematic phase should also
rapidly increase with β. However, the increase in the average concentration in the nematic phase is not as drastic as
it follows from Fig. 1. The general reason is that the ”rule of lever” cannot be applied for the present system, because
we are dealing with spatially inhomogeneous phases.

The average concentrations of nematic and isotropic phases, corresponding to phase separation, are shown in Fig.
5. This plot demonstrates that the average concentrations in both phases at ﬁxed value of β do depend on the total
concentration of rods and they do not coincide with the concentrations corresponding to the curves of Fig. 1 (dashed
lines in Fig. 5). This is because β
h, where h is the total height of the vessel. Thus, the parameter β is diﬀerent
for separate phases and for the system as a whole. That is why the average concentrations of the phases lie within
the region of phase separation shown in Fig. 1.

∼

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Gravitational or centrifugal external ﬁelds facilitate liquid-crystalline transition at the bottom of the vessel and
broadens the region of phase separation. This phenomenon should be noticeable for biological rod-like objects or
common lyotropic molecules sedimenting in a centrifugal ﬁeld. This seems to be an important problem which requires
experimental investigation.

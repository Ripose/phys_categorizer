We study the interation between Venus and the solar wind using a global three-dimensional

self-onsistent quasi-neutral hybrid (QNH) model. The model treats ions (H

, O

) as partiles

and eletrons as a massless harge neutralising (cid:29)uid. In the analysed Parker spiral interplanetary

magneti (cid:28)eld (IMF) ase (IMF = [8.09, 5.88, 0℄ nT) a notable north-south asymmetry of the

magneti (cid:28)eld and plasma exists, espeially in the properties of esaping planetary O

ions. The

asymmetry is assoiated with ion (cid:28)nite gyroradius e(cid:27)ets. Furthermore, the IMF x-omponent

results in a dawn-dusk asymmetry. Overall, the QNH model is found to reprodue the main observed

plasma and magneti (cid:28)eld regions (the bow shok, the magnetosheath, the magneti barrier and

the magnetotail), implying the potential of the developed model to study the Venusian plasma

environment and espeially the non-thermal ion esape.

In addition, the y < 0 hemisphere is alled the BSperp

on the y < 0 hemisphere where the IMF is perpendiular

and quasi-perpendiular to the bow shok in the anal-

ysed IMF ase. Similarly, the opposite y > 0 hemisphere

is referred to as the BSpar beause there are points on the
bow shok on the y > 0 hemisphere where the IMF is par-

allel and quasi-parallel to the bow shok in the analysed

IMF ase. It should be noted that if one had analysed

the IMF Bx < 0 ase the BSperp hemisphere would have
been at the y > 0 hemisphere. The BSperp /BSpar hemi-

spheres will be disussed in the next setion when the

asymmetries in the magnetosheath and the magneti tail

lobes are onsidered.

First, the total urrent density is derived from the mag-

rent, the number density and the average speed of ions

by Equations 4 and 6. Third, the updated eletri (cid:28)eld

is derived from the updated magneti (cid:28)eld, the urrent

density and the veloity (cid:28)eld of the eletron (cid:29)uid by us-

In this setions several plasma and magneti (cid:28)eld pa-

rameters are presented on the XY and XZ planes. The
used grid size of 0.1 RV prevents us from a detailed study

of the position and the shape of the various boundary

layers. Nevertheless, a oni shape is inluded in the (cid:28)g-

ures to help the eye in athing asymmetries more easily

and to simplify omparisons between various plasma and

magneti (cid:28)eld parameters. The onial shape [15℄

is used to provide a rough estimation for the shape of the

bow shok. Here r is the radial distane from the fous
point, rf ocus to the bow shok, ǫ is the eentriity, Θ is
the angle between the a point of a bow shok and the x-
axis and L is the distane of the bow shok from the fous
point on the x = x0 plane. In this paper the onial shape
on the XY and XZ planes is derived from Equations
15 - 16 for the parameters x0 = 0.6RV , ǫ = 0.87 and
L = 1.8RV .

V. SUMMARY

A three dimensional self-onsistent numerial model

is developed to study the Venus-solar wind interation.

An analysis of the runs made for a Parker spiral IMF

diretion suggests that several asymmetries take plae

sults from ion (cid:28)nite gyroradius e(cid:27)ets and from the

esaping O

ions while the IMF x-omponents aused

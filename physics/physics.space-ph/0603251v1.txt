Conditions in the solar wind resulting in magnetic storms on the Earth are a subject

of long and intensive investigations. Recently Zhang et al., 2006 [@] [Zh06 hereafter],

published a paper, where they used superposed epoch analyses method to study solar wind

features during 549 geomagnetic storms. Unfortunately, the used methodical approach

has not allowed to improve essentially understanding of relation of magnetic storms with

conditions in the solar wind, and ﬁrst of all for the following reasons.

1. Authors of Zh06 selected data on 4 diﬀerent categories: (1) moderate storm at solar

minimum, (2) moderate storm at solar maximum, (3) strong storm at solar minimum,

and (4) strong storm at solar maximum. In the strict sense, this selection approach has

not suﬃciently serious physical arguments.

On the one side, authors of Zh06 correctly noted that the storms are generated by

diﬀerent types of solar wind: ICME (MC) including Sheath and body of ICME and CIR

(see, for instance, Vieira et al., 2004 [@]; Huttunen and Koskinen 2004 [@]; Yermolaev

et al., 2005 [@]; Yermolaev and Yermolaev, 2006 [@]). Used method leads to averaging

corresponding parameters of diﬀerent types of solar wind and, as result of this procedure,

the calculated averaged parameters (for instance, density and temperature and parameters

using them during calculations) are really not observed in the solar wind during magnetic

storms. As have been shown by Yermolaev and Yermolaev, 2002 [@] time variations in

percentages of CIR-induced and ICME-induced storms have 2 maximuma (minimuma) per

solar cycle and change with opposite phases. It means that result of averaging strongly

depends, ﬁrst of all, on real proportion between diﬀerent types of solar wind included in

selected time intervals, rather than on phase of solar cycle.

YERMOLAEV ET AL.: COMMENT

On the other hand, there is no experimental argument in favor of hypothesis that physics

for moderate and strong storms may be diﬀerent. Because strong storms are induced

more often by ICMEs than CIRs, used selection of strong (moderate) storms results only

in increasing (decreasing) portion of ICMEs in averaging database of solar wind. In this

case result of averaging strongly depends on real proportion between diﬀerent types of

solar wind rather than level of Dst index using for storm selection.

2. Authors of Zh06 took minimum Dst time as zero time for superposed epoch method.

Because the main phase of storms may last from 2 up to 15 hours (see, for instance,

Gonzalez and Echer, 2006 [@]; Yermolaev et al., 2005 [@]; Yermolaev et al., 2006 [@]) the

shape of averaged Dst proﬁle of storms signiﬁcantly diﬀer from shape of really observed

storms and instead of onset (instant of storm start) has long (several hours) interval where

parameters before and after onset have been averaged. In the strick sense, in contrast to

usage of onset time as zero time (see for example Lyatsky and Tan, 2003 [@] used method

does not allow to select solar wind conditions before and after storm onset and to identify

solar wind sources of storms.

To illustrate mentioned above, Figs.1 and 2 present results of processing of OMNI data

for 623 magnetic storms with Dst < -60 nT during 1976-2000 (Yermolaev and Yermolaev,

2002 [@]; Yermolaev et al., 2006 [@]): time proﬁle of averaged Bz (top panels), Dst

and corrected Dst* parameters obtained by superposed epoch method with Dst storm

onset and Dst minimum as zero times, respectively. Fig.1. shows that the main phase

of averaged storm lasts about 8 hours and time diﬀerence between minimum Bz and

minimum Dst is about 6 hours while in Fig.2 (for the same zero time as in Zh06) there

is no clearly deﬁned main phase of the averaged storm and the time diﬀerence between

minima Bz and Dst is only 1-2 hours, although in both cases the decrease in Dst index

began in 1-2 hours after return of Bz component. The similar discrepancies are observed

for several another time diﬀerences obtained with diﬀerent zero times (see Figs. 3 and 4).

Diﬀerences in time proﬁles of solar wind and IMF parameters for CIR (121 storms),

Sheath (22) and MC (113) are shown in Figs.3 and 4. We designated as ”Unknown”

also 367 storms for which there were not full set of measurements or the type could not

be deﬁned unambiguously. Figs. 3 and 4 use onset time and minimum Dst time as

zero time, respectively, and show the same parameters: (Left column) N - density, V -

velocity, Pdyn - dynamic pressure, T - proton temperature, T/Texp - ratio of measured

proton temperature to calculated temperature using velocity, Dst index, (Right) β - ratio

of thermal to magnetic pressure, B, Bx, By and Bz - magnitude and GSM components

of IMF and Kp index. Curves for diﬀerent types of solar wind are presented by diﬀerent

color. The variability of data for all parameters and for all types of solar wind is suﬃciently

large, and therefore the table represents average values of their dispersion in the most

disturbed and interesting part: from -12 till +12 hours relative to onset. In several cases

the distinctions between curves are less than corresponding dispersions, and in this case

it is necessary to consider these distinctions as a tendency rather than a proved fact.

Because of place limit in the short comment we should discuss brieﬂy the additional

information arising owing to selection of data on solar wind types, and also advantages of

choice of zero time. First of all one can see that the strongest storms were generated by

sheaths but not by bodies of magnetic clouds. There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in T/Texp

and β, for CIR and Sheath, on one hand, and MC, on the other hand. The highest value

near onset is reached for density in CIR and for Pdyn in Sheath. Detailed discussion

and comparison of data in Fig.3 may be found in paper by Yermolaev et al., 2006. On

the other side, comparison of Figs. 3 and 4 shows several advantages of choice of onset

time as zero time. For example, Fig. 3 demonstrates that maximuma of density N and

magnitude of magnetic ﬁeld B for ”Unknown” type and CIR are observed at storm onset

and Fig.4 does not allow to make these conclusions.

Large parallel and perpendicular electric ﬁelds
on electron spatial scales in the terrestrial bow shock

(Dated: March 8, 2007)

Large parallel (≤ 100 mV/m) and perpendicular (≤ 600 mV/m) electric ﬁelds were measured
in the Earth’s bow shock by the vector electric ﬁeld experiment on the Polar satellite. These are
the ﬁrst reported direct measurements of parallel electric ﬁelds in a collisionless shock. These ﬁelds
exist on spatial scales comparable to or less than the electron skin depth (a few kilometers) and
correspond to magnetic ﬁeld-aligned potentials of tens of volts and perpendicular potentials up to
a kilovolt. The perpendicular ﬁelds are amongst the largest ever measured in space, with energy
densities of ǫ0E2/nkbTe of order 10%. The measured parallel electric ﬁeld implies that the electrons
can be demagnetized, which may result in stochastic (rather than coherent) electron heating.

In a collisionless plasma, shocks occur on scales much

shocks (Alfv´en Mach number MA < 20), the macroscopic
shock transition scale is approximately the gyroradius of
ions trapped at the shock front [? ], which is order 1000
km, while the collisional mean free path is of order 1
AU (1.5 108 km). Electric and magnetic ﬁelds within
the shock provide the required deceleration and entropy
change [? ? ]. An important problem in shock physics
is that of the energy budget across the shock. A cold,
super-Alfv´enic upstream ﬂow is thermalized as it crosses
the layer; however the downstream partitioning of the
available free energy between electrons, ions, and electro-
magnetic ﬁelds is not understood and is a key to inter-
preting observations of astrophysical shocks from remote
sensing measurements. A poorly understood element in
this energy partition problem is the cross-shock electric
potential, how it arises and how it scales with various
shock parameters. Collisionless shocks are also the source
of the energetic particles ubiquitous in heliospheric and
astrophysical contexts. In at least the case of the shock-
surﬁng acceleration mechanism, the cross-shock electric
ﬁeld plays a fundamental role in controlling the energiza-
tion process [? ].

The MHD generalized Ohm’s law for an electric ﬁeld
d~j
in a plasma is ~E + ~ve × ~B ≈ −~∇pe/ne + η~j + me
ne2
dt
(ignoring terms of order me/mi) and indicates that any
Ek is likely to arise from pressure or current gradients
or anomalous resistivity. In a deHoﬀman-Teller Lorentz
frame, in which the incoming ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld
are aligned, the convection electric ﬁeld is zero. Then
electron acceleration and heating may be due to a parallel
electric ﬁeld Ek.

The cross-shock direct current (DC) electric ﬁeld is dif-
ﬁcult to measure and has been reported rarely in the lit-
erature [? ? ? ? ] and parallel (magnetic ﬁeld-aligned)

electric ﬁelds have not been reported previously. The
electric ﬁeld is known to be spiky, although previous DC
measurements have often undersampled it. AC-coupled
spectral density and waveform measurements measure
broadband electrostatic turbulence [? ? ]
that cor-
responds to Debye-scale ’electron holes’ [? ] and ion
acoustic-like turbulence [? ].

Here we report measurements from two crossings of
the quasi-perpendicular terrestrial bow shock using data
from the Polar satellite. Polar has a 9.5 earth radius
(Re) apogee and encounters the bow shock in the sub-
solar region only during periods of extreme solar wind
pressure when the shock is compressed from its normal
stand-oﬀ distance of ∼15 Re. Polar carries the only three-
component DC electric ﬁeld experiment that has been
ﬂown in the outer magnetosphere and bow shock. It uses
six spherical sensors, each of whose potentials are mea-
sured with respect to that of the spacecraft body. The
spheres are on the ends of booms such that, by pairs,
they measure potential diﬀerences in the three orthog-
onal directions. Spheres 1 and 2 are separated by 130
meters while spheres 3 and 4 are separated by 100 me-
ters and are in the satellite spin plane. Spheres 5 and
6 are aligned along the spin axis and are separated by
13.6 meters by rigid booms [? ]. Techniques for mea-
suring parallel electric ﬁelds by such boom systems are
described elsewhere[? ]. The electric ﬁeld data described
in this paper were collected in instrument burst modes
at data rates of 1600 samples/second. Vector magnetic
ﬁelds are measured by the MFE ﬂuxgate magnetometer
instrument [? ] at a cadence of 8.3 vectors/sec.

Fig. 1 shows nine seconds of magnetic and electric
ﬁeld data on April 1, 2001 as the spacecraft crossed from
the magnetosheath, through the bow shock, and into the
solar wind near the subsolar point. A shock normal is es-
timated by maximum variance of the electric ﬁeld which
agrees well with previous estimates at this shock [? ];
shock parameters (estimated using ACE and Wind solar
wind data convected to 1 AU) are shown in Table 1. The
top three panels give the magnetic ﬁeld components in
GSE coordinates while panel d) gives the total magnetic

ﬁeld components in a magnetic ﬁeld aligned coordinate
system in which ˆz is parallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld,
ˆx is perpendicular to both the local magnetic ﬁeld and to
the vector from the spacecraft to the center of the earth,
and ˆy completes a right hand coordinate system. From
the time delay between the signals on spheres 1 and 2, the
speed of the structure over in the spacecraft frame was
50 km/sec. Thus, the total parallel ﬁeld structure had a
thickness of ∼2.5 km and the individual intensity peaks
were ∼0.25 km thick. The individual peak thicknesses
were about equal to the gyroradius of a 25 eV electron
and about 25% of the electron skin depth, c/ωpe, where
ωpe is the electron plasma frequency. The thickness of
the entire 50 msec structure was about 5% of the proton
gyroradius or a few electron skin depths. The net parallel
potential across the structure was about 15 volts. The
upstream plasma parameters are given in Table 1.

A second 50 msec example from the same shock cross-
ing is given in Fig. 4, which has the same format as Fig.
3. Because the time lag in the signals between opposite
pairs of spheres in panels a) through f) was not measur-
ably diﬀerent from zero, the structure speed across the
spacecraft was >50 km/sec. For purposes of estimating
measured parameters, the speed is assumed to be 50-100
km/sec [? ]. In this example, perpendicular electric ﬁelds
as large as 150 mV/m (panel (h)) and parallel ﬁelds as
large as 100 mV/m (panel (i)) were measured, in the
spacecraft frame. Lorentz transformation to the shock
frame (50-100 km/s) can give transformation ﬁelds as
big as |~v × ~B| ∼ 10 mV/m to E⊥; of course, the parallel
electric ﬁeld Ek = ~E · ˆB is a Lorentz invariant. The 12
msec duration of these big ﬁeld pulses corresponds to a
thickness of 0.6-1.2 km, which is 0.5-1 times the electron
skin depth and 0.3-0.5 times the radius of gyration of
10-50 eV electrons. The total parallel electric potential
across the structure was 30-60 volts.

ﬁeld with several overshoots in the downstream region
before decreasing to the solar wind value of about 15
nT. The electric ﬁeld components (in GSE) in the bot-
tom three panels are characterized by > 100 mV/m rapid
oscillations that appear in the shock ramp. Search coil
magnetometer measurements at these shocks (not shown)
show broadband noise (probably whistler-mode), but no
features that correspond to the electric ﬁelds reported
here. These electric ﬁelds are therefore electrostatic and
are either stationary structures within the shock, or mov-
ing very slowly with respect to it.

From Fig. 2 it is seen that the electric ﬁeld ’wave
front’ that passed over the sensors on April 8, 2001 at
18:56:58.55 UT traveled largely from sphere 1 to sphere
2 and nearly along the magnetic ﬁeld direction. Thus,
signatures of the structure should be seen ﬁrst in sphere
1 and then in sphere 2. This expectation is borne out by
the data of Fig. 3 where the sphere one signal in panel a)
leads that from sphere 2 in panel b) by 1.8 data points
(1.2 msec) according to their cross-correlation. Other-
wise the two signals are anti-correlated, signifying a large
electric ﬁeld in the 1-2 direction. That the sphere 3 and
sphere 4 signals are small indicates that the electric ﬁeld
was approximately parallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld di-
rection (see Fig. 2). This expectation is borne out in
the bottom three panels of Fig. 3, which give the electric

Another

sub-solar quasi-perpendicular bow shock
crossing occurred on April 11, 2001 and is shown in the
one minute of data presented in Fig. 5. Again, the space-
craft passed from the magnetosheath where the magnetic
ﬁeld intensity was ∼100 nT (panel d)) to the solar wind,
where the ﬁeld strength was about 25 nT. And again,
the electric ﬁeld showed spiky structures (in the ramp
but not in the solar wind) that exceeded the 200 mV/m
dynamic range of the plot in panel e).

Fig. 6 presents 50 msec of data during one of the
biggest ﬁeld events of this crossing. The potentials of
sphere pairs 1-2 and 3-4 were anti-correlated as expected
for an external electric ﬁeld and the time delay between
signals in any pair was less than one data point. This
requires that the structure speed was >50 km/sec and a
speed of 50-100 km/sec will be assumed in the interpreta-
tion of the data. For this range of speeds, the structure
that lasted ∼15 msec had a thickness of 0.75-1.5 km,
which is ∼1 electron skin depth and ∼10 gyroradii of 10-
50 eV electrons. The perpendicular electric ﬁeld was as
large as 600 mV/m, which is as large as observed any-
where in space. It pointed generally sunward as would be
expected for a ﬁeld that slows the solar wind ions. The
energy density in this ﬁeld ǫ0E2/nkbTe is approximately

0.12, which implies that the ﬁelds are highly nonlinear.
The electric potential across this structure was 400-800
volts, depending on the assumed structure speed. Up-
stream shock parameters are given in Table 1.

The parallel electric potentials of tens of volts and the
perpendicular potentials of hundreds to a thousand volts
evidently contribute to the total cross-shock electric po-
tential responsible for slowing the bulk ﬂow and heating
the electrons. The total cross-ﬁeld potential arises from
the accumulation of many short, spiky electric ﬁeld struc-
tures.

Since these shocks have non-zero parallel electric ﬁelds
with scale sizes that are comparable to or less than the
electron skin depth, the electrons are no longer magne-
tized (i.e. ~E +~ve × ~B 6= 0). This condition is similar to an
’electron diﬀusion region’ in magnetic reconnection and
allows for rapid relative motion of the magnetic ﬁeld,
if the boundary conditions provide strong shear. Fur-
thermore, demagnetized electrons do not obey the ﬁrst
adiabatic invariant and hence some part of the electron
’heating’ may be due to stochastic motion (rather than
purely coherent eﬀects), a point which has been debated
by theorists in the literature [? ].

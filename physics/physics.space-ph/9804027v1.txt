Abstract

It is shown that the plasma, generated during an impact of a mete-
oroid with an artiﬁcial satellite, can produce electromagnetic radiations
below the microwave frequency range. These interferences can disturb the
regular satellite operations.

Introduction

In June 1998, the ﬁrst modules of the International Space Station will be put
in orbit around the Earth and this should open new frontiers for life in space.
The intensive use of the space makes necessary to know the potential risks. The
threat from meteoroids is today well known and several authors have underlined
the risks connected with the impact on a spacecraft (for a review, see [1]).
However, the Olympus end-of-life anomaly [2] and the recent work of McDonnell
et al. [3] put a new light on these issues. The Olympus failure is a paradigmatic
example: in that case, the impact with a Perseid meteoroid may have generated
electrical failures, leading to a chain reaction which culminated with an early
end of the mission [2]. On the other hand, McDonnell et al. [3] showed that,
if the plasma charge and current production during an impact are considered,
meteoroid streams can be very dangerous, even during normal conditions. It
should be noted that they considered only damages by direct discharges or
current injection in circuits.

However, there are several other ways by which the plasma could interact
with the spacecraft electronics. For example, it is useful to recall the work of
Cerroni and Martelli [4], in which they showed that thermal forces in impact-
produced plasmas could explain the magnetisation observed in the neighbour-
hood of lunar craters. Even if Cerroni and Martelli studied experimentally
hypervelocity impacts of aluminium projectiles on basalt targets, it is possible
to extend their work to general hypervelocity impacts.

Here, we show that a plasma cloud, generated during a hypervelocity impact
of a meteoroid with an artiﬁcial satellite, can radiate electromagnetic energy
below the microwave frequency range and, therefore, can disturb the regular
satellite operations.

2 Meteoroids impacts

It is well known that, during a hypervelocity impact, a fraction of the projec-
tile and target materials is evaporated and even ionized [5]. A plasma cloud
is then created almost instantaneously after the impact and expands into the
surrounding vacuum. McDonnell et al. [3] found an empirical formula for the
evaluation of charge Q produced during a hypervelocity impact. This equation,
rearranged in order to emphasize the projectile dimensions and density, can be
written as follows:

Q ≃ 3.04δ

(1)
r
where δ is the meteoroid density [kg/m3], r its radius [m] and V its speed [km/s].
In this paper, we consider, as a speciﬁc example, the Leonid meteoroid stream,
that is the most dangerous stream known today owing to its high geocentric

speed. Typical values of δ and V for Leonids are, respectively, 1000 kg/m3 and
71 km/s.

In order to calculate the plasma characteristic parameters (Debye length and
plasma frequency [6]), it is necessary to make further assumptions. The plasma
cloud generated during an impact has been studied theoretically (e.g. [7]) and
experimentally (e.g., [4], [8], [9]). A projectile in an experimental facility reaches
a speed up to about 10 km/s, far below meteoroids speeds, but data obtained
in such experiments allow us to make some extrapolations.

Kadono and Fujiwara [8] recently investigated the expansion of the plasma
cloud: they used nylon projectiles, with a speed range between 3 and 6 km/s,
impacting targets made of diﬀerent materials and found that the expansion
velocity of the leading edge of the gas, umax, is almost constant in time. The
value is about twice that of the isothermal sound velocity (cs):

umax =

2cs

(2)

where γ = cp/cv is the constant ratio of speciﬁc heats, R is the universal gas
constant [R = 8.314510 J·mol−1K−1], T is the gas temperature [K] and µ is
the mean atomic weight of the plasma cloud. For a Leonid meteoroid, we can
consider an almost complete composition of carbon and a plasma temperature of
30,000 K, taking into account that about 1% of the kinetic energy is partitioned
into ionization [5]. For γ, a value of 1.7 is considered [8]. With these assumptions
we obtain an expansion speed umax = 12.8 · 103 m/s.

Moreover, we assume that the plasma cloud is almost hemispherical during
ﬁrst 20 µs and thus has a radius ρ = 0.256 m. Then, the charge generated,
calculated with Equation (1), must be distributed (we assume uniformly) in
a volume about 0.035 m3. Considering each atom singly ionized, we can now
calculate the electron volume density ne and, then, the Debye length λD and
the plasma frequency ν (see Table 1).

3 Electromagnetic interferences

From these data, it is possible to see that the plasma characteristic dimensions
are several times smaller than the cloud characteristic dimensions. The physical
meaning of the plasma characteristic parameters (λD and ν) is that electrons
can move, with respect to ions, a distance λD in a time ν−1, before that an
electric ﬁeld raises in order to restore the charge neutrality. Ions and electrons
can be seen as electric dipoles, with distance λD, oscillating with a frequency ν.
If we consider the microwave frequency limit of νmw = 3 · 1011 Hz, we infer that
a Leonid meteoroid with a mass up to 8 mg is suﬃcient to generate a plasma
cloud with a characteristic frequency lower than νmw.

The average radiated power by a dipole is well known from electromagnetic
theory [10]. We assume that the ﬁeld produced at distances R >> λD (far ﬁeld
condition) by a spherical dipole distribution, with λD as radius, is equivalent to
the ﬁeld of a point dipole with moment amplitude:

where e is the electron charge [C]. For ν = νmw = 3 · 1011 Hz, we obtain
p = 1.2 · 10−23 C·m. Then, the average radiated power is:

where ǫ0 = 8.854187817 · 10−12 [F/m] is the vacuum dielectric constant, c is the
light speed in vacuum [m/s] and ω = 2πν.

This value must be compared with the noise of satellite electronic devices.
Below 6 · 1012 Hz, the noise has a ﬂat power spectral density of about 4 · 10−21
W/Hz, that is -204 dB W/Hz [11]. If we consider a radar, which has a bandwidth
of about 60 dB Hz, and other factors that make worse, the mean noise power in
a receiver is about -146 dB W, that is 2.5 · 10−15 W. Comparing these estimates
with (4), we obtain an interference of at least two order of magnitude greater
than the electronic noise. Now, it seems clear that the plasma can generate an
electromagnetic interference that is not negligible and can disturb the regular
satellite operations. For a speciﬁc example, if we consider the International
Space Station (1000 m2 area), exposed for 1 hour to a meteoroid ﬂux like 1966
Leonids, there is 41% of impact probability with a meteoroid with mass equal
or greater than 10−8 kg [12]. Such an impact ﬂux can produce a sequence
of interferences which can increase the noise level in electronic devices, then
disturbing the regular satellite operations.

4 Conclusions

After the Olympus end of life anomaly [2] and the work of McDonnell et al. [3], it
seems clear that the meteoroids hazard is not restricted to a mechanical damage.
The plasma charge and current production can destroy the onboard electronics
when directly injected in circuits. Here it is suggested another interference path,
that is electromagnetic radiations emitted from the impact-produced plasma
cloud. Even if the radiated power is not suﬃcient to destroy anything, it can
disturb the regular satellite operations. Further investigations should be made
on speciﬁc satellite, because they require detailed information about onboard
electronics, in order to calculate possible couplings and non-linearities.

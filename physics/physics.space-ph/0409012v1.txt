Introduction

Many problems of magnetohydrodynamics do not have analytic solutions and have to be ap-
proached using simple models that help to understand some important phenomena and to distinguish
amongst the more and less inﬂuential ones.

Terrestrial magnetosphere is the layer of the atmosphere related to terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld,
where interactions between the magnetic ﬁeld and the wind coming from the Sun occur, deforming
the magnetic ﬁeld in the direction of solar wind ﬂow. The solar wind is a ”ionized gas” with a very
large electrical conductivity, chieﬂy made up of protons and electrons of high velocities [1].

As the velocity of this ﬂuid is so large, far away from the source of magnetic ﬁeld it is not aﬀected
appreciable due to terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld, however the magnetic ﬁeld changes the trajectory of
particles near the Earth, partly this is the cause that certain low energy particles remain trapped
in the magnetic ﬁeld oscillating and producing electromagnetic radiation, and in the poles their
interaction with air molecules cause the know eﬀect called northern dawn [1].

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we derivate the Magnetohydrodynamic equations,
in section 3 we describe the problem and calculate the deformation of terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld due
to the solar wind. Section 4 is devoted to analysis of the results and conclusions.

Equation (2. 14) is the continuity equation for mass, where ρ is the density of matter and ~v the
velocity of the ﬂuid; equation (2. 13) is called the Navier-Stokes’s equation or movement equation for
ﬂuids. In this equation intervenes the pressure gradient, a term of magnetic force and a term due to
the viscosity of the ﬂuid. If we considered that the ﬂuid is incompressible, equations (2. 12)-(2. 14)
are a complete set describing the dynamics of the ﬂuid and the magnetic ﬁeld, on the other hand,
if the ﬂuid is considered compressible, in addition of equations (2. 12)-(2. 14) the state equation of
the ﬂuid should be in mind. Equations (2. 12)-(2. 14) are the magnetohydrodynamic equations.

3 Problem Description

The objective of this work is to analyze how the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld is modiﬁed by the
presence of the solar wind in zones far away from Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld source. For this, we consider

3

a conductive ﬂuid whose velocity is constant, i.e. ~v = v0 ˆax. This approximation is valid in the sense
that the velocity of solar wind particles is very high far away of Earth, and is not aﬀected appreciably
by the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld. Besides, we also consider an incompresible and irrotacional ﬂuid,
which is equivalent to exclude the dynamics related to the formation of vortices in the ﬂuid, that
generally form in the proximities of Earth, because its magnetic ﬁeld is very strong. According to
these considerations, the velocity of the ﬂuid can be written as the gradient of a potential function
of the form:

From equation (2. 14), for an incompressible ﬂuid its density is constant, then we obtain:

~v =

φv.

Another aspect that we consider is the stationary case in which the physical quantities remain
constant in time. This approximation can be achieved if we take a constant velocity for the solar
wind. Another factor might carry changes in Earth’s magnetosphere is related to possible variations
of Earth’s magnetic dipole moment, however it has a very small eﬀect during small intervals of time
[4]. Accordingly, equation (2. 2) for the electric ﬁeld can be expressed as:

In this model we also suppose that the ﬂuid does not possess net electrical charge as, although the
gas in consideration is composed by charged particles, to great scale the net charge is very small.
Then Gauss’s Law ec.(2. 1) is given by:

Taking into equation (2. 11)

this last expression is known as the diﬀusion equation for magnetic ﬁelds, which can be obtained
also by considering that the electric ﬁeld is null, i.e., if we take a the trivial solution for equation
(3. 18), then we have ~E = 0. In our model obtaining a non-trivial solution for the diﬀusion equation
~B = 0. By this
(2. 12) can be a complicated calculation, as it also has to verify the condition

It is well known that the velocity is proportional to the negative gradient of the potential function

The solution of equation (3. 32, is known as the modiﬁed Helmholtz’s equation, which is given in
terms of the spherical harmonics and the modiﬁed spherical Bessel polynomials, this is:

B0 =

[Clmil(kr) + Dlmnl(kr)] Ylm(θ, φ).

(3. 34)

As we want a converging solution, we have to require that Clm = 0. Then, the solution for B0 is:

It can be shown by means of direct calculation that this magnetic ﬁeld satisﬁes Maxwell’s equations
and the diﬀusion equation (2. 12). Nevertheless, from the analytic expression is diﬃcult to see the
form that the ﬁeld possesses, therefore it is convenient to observe a graphic of the magnetic ﬁeld in
the space. For doing this we should keep in mind that constant k contains the information of the
solar wind, i.e. velocity and conductivity.

To see the inﬂuence of velocity of solar wind upon the magnetic ﬁeld two graphics in the plane
y = 0, m = 1d are shown: ﬁgure 1a shows the case of k = 0, 005 u−1 and ﬁgure 1b shows k = 0, 01
u−1, where u is an adequate unit of length and d is an adequate unit for m.

Figures No. 1a and No. 1b show that the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld is dragged by the solar wind in
the direction of its movement, compressing the ﬁeld lines in the face of earth directed towards the
Sun.

Figures No. 2a and No. 2b show the current in 2D, using vectors to visualize its direction, just
as we did with the magnetic ﬁeld. It is clear from (2. 8) that the current is perpendicular to the
velocity of the solar wind, this means that it does not possess a component in the ˆx direction, by
this reason we draw the components y and z. The values of k and m are the same as those for ﬁgure
No. 1a; m = 1d, k = 0, 005 u−1.

The equation of movement (3. 48), according to our Process, should not be satisﬁed due to the
fact that it was Taken a constant velocity in ˆx direction for the solar wind. We must remind that
equation (3. 48) tells us about the velocity of the ﬂuid in all space, while that of our model is valid
just far away of the planet. By this reason, in the equation of movement (3. 48) we cannot consider
a constant velocity, since it would be a meaningless equation. It is convenient to consider small
variations in the velocities, small enough to preserve the condition that far away from the planet
velocities are almost constant. Later we will see that this consideration is correct as the magnetic
force vanishes quickly if we move far away from Earth. It is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a solution of equation

Substituting in equation (3. 49) the values of the magnetic ﬁeld and of the current induced upon
the solar wind, we obtain the force of the magnetic ﬁeld of Earth upon the solar wind. In ﬁgure
No. 3 we show a vector diagram of the forces in the plane y = 0. In this ﬁgure the eﬀect of the
magnetic ﬁeld upon the ﬂuid can be observed, trying to move it toward the ”poles”. In the ˆx axis,
which is the direction of the incident solar wind, the ﬁeld tends to turn back the ﬂuid, this force
generates a strong pressure that, in a better model, would modify the velocity of the ﬂuid making
it to go around the magnetosphere, protecting the surface of the planet from high velocity ionized
gases. In the same direction, the ˆx axis, when the ﬂuid has passed the planet it tends to brake but
the braking force is not strong enough.

4 Conclusions

We have shown that the terrestrial magnetosphere is aﬀected by the solar wind, suﬀering a length-
ening of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. On the other hand, due to the presence of the terrestrial magnetic
ﬁeld, certain currents arise inside the solar wind, generating an additional magnetic ﬁeld which
superposes to the dipole magnetic ﬁeld, creating the total ﬁeld in the magnetosphere.

We have shown in this model that the force exerted by the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld upon the
solar wind vanishes very quickly with distance, when we move away from Earth. As a consequence,
our model is valid for determinate the magnetic ﬁeld far from the Earth.

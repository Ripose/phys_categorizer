LIU ET AL.: GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF MCS

Abstract. We present direct evidence for the highly ﬂattened and curved

cross section of MCs resulting from the interaction with the ambient solar

wind. Lower limits of the transverse size are obtained for three MCs pass-

ing ACE and Ulysses successively from the latitudinal separation between

the two spacecraft, ranging from 40 to 70◦. The cross-section aspect ratio

of the MCs is estimated to be no smaller than 6:1. We oﬀer a simple model

to extract the radius of curvature of the cross section, based on the eleva-

tion angle of the MC normal distributed over latitude. Application of the model

to Wind observations from 1995 - 1997 (close to solar minimum) show that

the cross section is bent concavely outward by a structured solar wind with

a radius of curvature of ∼ 0.3 AU. Near solar maximum, MCs tend to be con-

vex outward in the solar wind with a uniform speed; the radius of curvature

is proportional to the heliographic distance of MCs, as demonstrated by Ulysses

observations between 1999 and 2003. These results improve our knowledge

of the global morphology of MCs in the pre-Stereo era, which is crucial for

space weather prediction and heliosphere studies.

1. Introduction

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are spectacular eruptions in the solar corona. In addi-

tion to 1015−16 g of plasma, CMEs carry a huge amount of magnetic ﬂux and helicity into

the heliosphere. Their interplanetary manifestations (ICMEs) often show a regular mag-

netic pattern; ICMEs with this pattern have been classiﬁed as magnetic clouds (MCs).

MCs are characterized by a strong magnetic ﬁeld, a smooth and coherent rotation of the

magnetic ﬁeld vector, and a depressed proton temperature compared to the ambient solar

wind [Burlaga et al., 1981].

MCs drive many space weather events and aﬀect the solar wind throughout the helio-

sphere, so it is important to understand their spatial structure. Most in situ observations

give information on a single line through an MC; ﬂux-rope ﬁtting techniques have been

developed to interpret these local measurements. Cylindrically symmetric models vary

from a linear force-free ﬁeld [e.g., Burlaga, 1988; Lepping et al., 1990] to non-force-free

ﬁelds with a current density dependence [e.g., Hidalgo et al., 2002a; Cid et al., 2002].

Elliptical models take into account the expansion and distortion eﬀect of MCs, also based

on the linear force-free [Vandas and Romashets, 2003] and non-force-free approaches [e.g.,

Mulligan and Russell, 2001; Hidalgo et al., 2002b]. The Grad-Shafranov (GS) technique

relaxes the force-free assumption and reconstructs the cross section of MCs in the plane

perpendicular to the cloud’s axis without prescribing the geometry [e.g., Hau and Son-

nerup, 1999; Hu and Sonnerup, 2002]. Although useful in describing local observations,

these models may signiﬁcantly underestimate the true dimension, magnetic ﬂux and helic-

ity of MCs [Riley et al., 2004; Dasso et al., 2005]; the ambiguities in their results cannot

be removed since they involve many free parameters and assumptions. Multiple point

observations are therefore required to properly invert the global structure of MCs.

Indirect evidence, both from observations and numerical simulations, suggests that MCs

are highly ﬂattened and distorted due to their interaction with the ambient solar wind.

CMEs observed at the solar limb typically have an angular width of 50 - 60◦ and maintain

this width as they propagate through the corona [e.g., Webb et al., 1997; St. Cyr et al.,

2000]. At 1 AU, this angular width would correspond to a size of ∼ 1 AU, much larger

than the ICME’s radial thickness of ∼ 0.2 AU [e.g., Liu et al., 2005]. Shocks driven by

fast MCs have a standoﬀ distance which is too large to be produced by a cylindrically

symmetric ﬂux rope [Russell and Mulligan, 2002]. The oblate cross section of MCs is also

indicated by global magnetohydrodymic (MHD) simulations of the propagation both in

a uniform [e.g., Odstrcil et al., 2002; Riley et al., 2003] and structured solar wind [e.g.,

Groth et al., 2000; Odstrcil et al., 2004; Manchester et al., 2004].

The simulated ﬂux ropes show an interesting curvature which depends on the back-

ground solar wind state. Figure 1 shows an idealized sketch of ﬂux ropes in the solar

meridianal plane, initially having a radius r0 = 1 r⊙ at a height h0 = 2 r⊙ from the Sun,

where r⊙ represents the solar radius. This conﬁguration corresponds to an angular extent

of 60◦ subtended by the rope. At a time t, a point in the ﬂux rope coordinates (r, φ)

translates to the heliographic location assuming kinematic evolution [Riley and Crooker,

2004; Owens et al., 2006]

where v is the solar wind speed and A = 0.1 is the ratio of the expansion speed at the rope

edge relative to its center to the solar wind speed. The left ﬂux rope is propagating into

a uniform solar wind with a speed of v = 450 km s−1, while the right one is propagating

into a solar wind with a latitudinal speed gradient v = 700 sin2 θ + 400 km s−1. After 4

days these ﬂux ropes arrive at 1 AU. Due to the expansion of the solar wind, plasmas on

diﬀerent stream lines move apart while the magnetic tension in the ﬂux rope tries to keep

them together. Since the ﬂow momentum overwhelms the magnetic force after a few solar

radii, the ﬂux rope is stretched azimuthally but its angular extent is conserved, as shown

in Figure 1. The left case is representative of solar maximum, when the solar wind speed

is roughly uniform in the meridianal plane. The right panel represents solar minimum,

when fast solar wind originates from large polar coronal holes and slow wind is conﬁned

to low latitudes associated with helmet streamers [e.g., McComas et al., 1998]. The ﬂux

rope is bent convexly outward by a spherical expansion of the solar wind (left panel) or

concavely outward by a structured wind (right panel).

From Figure 1, we obtain a simple relationship between the latitude θ of an observing

spacecraft and the normal elevation angle δ of the ﬂux rope at the spacecraft

δ = arcsin(

sin θ).

(1)

The radius of curvature, Rc, is deﬁned such that it is positive when the ﬂux rope is curved

away from the Sun (left panel) and negative when curved toward the Sun (right panel). In

the left case, Rc = R, so equation 1 is reduced to θ = δ. Since MCs are highly ﬂattened as

discussed above, the normal would be along the minimum variance direction of the ﬂux-

rope magnetic ﬁeld. The radius of curvature of MCs can be extracted from equation 1

by examining the latitudinal distribution of the normal elevation angles. Lower limits for

the transverse size of MCs can be derived from pairs of spacecraft widely separated in

latitude. Ulysses, complemented with a near-Earth spacecraft, is particularly useful for

this research since it covers latitudes up to 80◦.

This paper applies the above methodology to give the ﬁrst direct observational evidence

for the large-scale transverse size and curvature of MCs. The data and analysis methods

are described in section 2. Sections 3 and 4 give lower limits for the transverse size of MCs

and study how they are curved in diﬀerent solar wind states, respectively. We summarize

and discuss the results in section 5.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

To give a meaningful measure of the transverse size, we need at least two spacecraft

separated as widely as possible in the solar meridianal plane. Launched in 1991, Ulysses

explores the solar wind conditions at distances from 1 to 5.4 AU and up to 80◦ in latitude.

Wind and ACE have provided near-Earth measurements (within 7◦ of the solar equatorial

plane) since 1994 and 1998, respectively. We ﬁrst look for MCs in Ulysses data when it

is more than 30◦ away from the solar equator. If we see the same MC at the near-Earth

spacecraft, then its transverse width is at least the spacecraft separation. To determine if

the spacecraft observe the same MC, we look at the timing and data similarities (similar

transient signatures, the same chirality, etc.), and use a one-dimensional (1-D) MHD

model to do data alignment.

We require that the MC axis lie close to the solar equatorial plane. Otherwise, the width

we invert is the length of the ﬂux rope other than the transverse size of the cross section;

this requirement also minimizes the eﬀect of axial curvature. In addition, our curvature

study needs MCs not to be aligned with the radial direction. Wind observations in 1995 -

1997 are used to investigate the MC curvature near solar minimum, while Ulysses as well

as the near-Earth spacecraft provides observations from 1999 to 2003 for the curvature

study near solar maximum.

2.1. Coordination of Observations via 1-D MHD Modeling

Single-point observations can only sample MCs at a speciﬁc distance. As MCs propagate

in the solar wind, they may change appreciably. Models are needed to connect observations

at diﬀerent spacecraft. Studies to compare ICME observations at various locations have

been performed, using ICME signatures and an MHD simulation to trace their evolution

[e.g., Wang et al., 2001; Richardson et al., 2002; Riley et al., 2003]. We follow the same

approach and use a 1-D MHD model developed by Wang et al. [2000] to propagate the

solar wind from 1 AU to Ulysses. Momentum and energy source terms resulting from

the interaction between solar wind ions and interstellar neutrals can be included in this

model, but we drop them since they have a negligible eﬀect on the solar wind propagation

within Ulysses’ distance. All physical quantities at the inner boundary (1 AU) are set

to the average near-Earth solar wind conditions; the MHD equations are then solved by

a piecewise parabolic scheme to give a steady state solar wind solution. Observations at

1 AU (typically 60 days long) containing the ICME data are introduced into the model

as perturbations. The numerical calculation stops when the perturbation has traveled to

Ulysses. The model output is compared with Ulysses observations. Note that the 1-D

model assumes spherical symmetry, so we do not expect the model output to exactly

match the Ulysses data. Nevertheless, large stream structures should be similar and allow

us to align these data sets.

2.2. Minimum Variance Analysis

The axis orientation of MCs is needed to specify their global structure. Minimum

variance analysis (MVA) of the measured magnetic ﬁeld yields useful principle axes [e.g.,

Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967; Sonnerup and Scheible, 1998]. A normal direction, ˆn, can be

identiﬁed by minimizing the deviation of the ﬁeld component Bm · ˆn from hBi · ˆn for a

series of measurements of m = 1, . . . , N

σ2 =

|(Bm − hBi) · ˆn|2,

where hBi is the average magnetic ﬁeld vector. Optimizing the above equation under the

constraint of |ˆn|2 = 1 results in the eigenvalue problem of the covariance matrix of the

magnetic ﬁeld

Mµν = hBµBνi − hBµihBµi,

(3)

where µ, ν indicate the ﬁeld components in Cartesian coordinates. Eigenvectors of the

matrix, ˆx⋆, ˆy⋆, ˆz⋆, corresponding to the eigenvalues in order of decreasing magnitude,

denote the the maximum, intermediate and minimum variance directions. Evidently, the

normal of an elongated ﬂux rope should be along the minimum variance direction (see

Figure 1); the maximum variance would occur azimuthally since the azimuthal component

changes its sign across the ﬂux rope; the intermediate variance direction is identiﬁed as the

axis orientation due to the non-uniform distribution of the axial ﬁeld over the ﬂux-rope

cross section. The MVA method also gives the chirality of the ﬂux-rope ﬁelds as can be

seen from the maximum variance plane of the magnetic ﬁeld (refer to Figure 2).

2.3. Grad-Shafranov Technique

Initially designed for the study of the terrestrial magnetopause [e.g., Hau and Sonnerup],

the GS technique can be applied to ﬂux-rope reconstruction [e.g., Hu and Sonnerup,

2002]. It assumes an approximate deHoﬀmann-Teller (HT) frame in which the electric

ﬁeld vanishes everywhere. This reference frame can be obtained by minimizing the residual

electric ﬁeld, provided that plasma velocities relative to the HT frame are substantially

smaller than the local Alfv´en velocity, a measure of the dynamic eﬀect [Khrabrov and

Sonnerup, 1998]. It follows from Faraday’s law, ∇ × E = − ∂B

∂t , that the magnetic ﬁeld

is quasi-stationary when viewed in the HT frame. Structures in such a frame obey MHD

equilibrium, j × B − ∇p = 0, which can be reduced to the so-called GS equation [e.g.,

by assuming a translational symmetry along the ﬂux rope (i.e., ∂

∂z =0). The vector poten-

tial is deﬁned as A = A(x, y)ˆz, through which the magnetic ﬁeld is given by

B = (

The key idea in reconstructing the ﬂux rope is that the thermal pressure p and the axial

ﬁeld Bz are functions of A alone. The ﬂux-rope orientation is determined by the single-

valued behavior of the transverse pressure pt = p + B2

z /2µ0 over the vector potential

A, which essentially requires that the same ﬁeld line be crossed twice by an observing

spacecraft. Observations yield the transverse pressure, while the vector potential along

the spacecraft trajectory (y = 0) is derived from equation 7 as A(x, 0) = −

By(x, 0)dx.

R

Once the invariant z axis is acquired, the right-hand side of equation 6 can be derived from

the diﬀerentiation of the best ﬁt of pt versus A. This best ﬁt is assumed to hold over the

entire ﬂux-rope cross section. Away from the observation baseline, the vector potential

A is calculated based on its second order Taylor expansion with respect to y. Since the

integration is intrinsically a Cauchy problem, numerical singularities are generated after

a certain number of steps. As a result, the transverse size is generally limited to half of

the width along the observation line in the integration domain. Detailed procedures can

be found in Hau and Sonnerup [1999] and Hu and Sonnerup [2002]. Here we only use this

approach to determine the axis orientation of MCs and make a comparison with MVA.

3. Lower Limits of the Transverse Extent

Application of the criteria and restrictions given in section 2 yields three MCs observed

at both ACE and Ulysses with a latitudinal separation larger than 30◦. Table 1 lists the

times, locations, estimated axis orientations and chiralities for ACE and Ulysses obser-

vations, respectively. The location of the spacecraft is given in the heliographic inertial

frame. The MC denoted as PR in the table was shown to be observed at both the space-

craft by Riley et al.

[2003] through a qualitative comparison between data and a MHD

model output; the two spacecraft were separated by 15◦ in latitude. Table 1 also gives the

CMEs observed at the Sun (adopted from http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME−list) that best

match the occurrence time calculated from the MC’s transit speed at 1 AU. Application

of the MVA method to the normalized magnetic ﬁeld measurements and the GS technique

to the plasma and magnetic ﬁeld observations within the MCs give the axis orientation,

in terms of the elevation (Θ) and azimuthal (Φ) angles. The axis azimuthal angle is given

in RTN coordinates (in which R points from the Sun to the spacecraft, T is parallel to

the solar equatorial plane and points to the planet motion direction, and N completes

the right-handed triad), which allows us to see if the axis is perpendicular to the radial

direction (i.e., close to 90◦ or 270◦). The magnetic ﬁeld and velocity vectors inside the

MCs are rotated into the heliographic inertial frame in order to have an axis elevation

angle with respect to the solar equatorial plane. The estimates of the axis orientation

from the MVA and GS methods roughly agree. All the MCs generally lie close to the

solar equator and perpendicular to the radial direction.

The MC travel time from ACE to Ulysses is consistent with the observed speeds. They

also have the same chirality as listed in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the plasma and magnetic

ﬁeld measurements for the third MC in the table at ACE and Ulysses separated by 72◦

in latitude.

Identiﬁed with the deﬁning signatures, this MC is also characterized by

an enhanced helium abundance compared with the ambient solar wind. The helium

enhancement has been shown to be an eﬀective tool to trace ICMEs from 1 AU to Ulysses

D R A F T

X - 12

and Voyager 2 [e.g., Paularena et al., 2001; Richardson et al., 2002]. The velocity and

magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are strongly anti-correlated outside the MC both at ACE and

Ulysses, which indicates the presence of Alfv´en waves; this wave activity also occurs within

the MC but at a reduced ﬂuctuation level. The bottom panels of Figure 2 display the

normalized magnetic ﬁeld inside the MC projected onto the maximum variance plane. The

majority of the data show a smooth rotation of about 180◦; both the rotations indicate a

left-handed chirality of the magnetic conﬁguration.

We propagate the ACE data to Ulysses using the 1-D MHD model described in section 2.

Figure 3 shows the velocity proﬁles observed at ACE and Ulysses, and the model proﬁles

every 0.2 AU in between and at Ulysses (2.3 AU). At 1 AU, several large-scale stream

structures are present; the MC interval is close to an interaction region between two

adjacent streams. The model predicts a slower solar wind than observed at Ulysses,

which is reasonable given the large latitudinal separation (72◦) between ACE and Ulysses

and possible diﬀerences in the ambient solar wind. The large streams at 1 AU survive to

Ulysses as clearly shown by the traces and model-data comparison at Ulysses. The MC

also lies near an interaction region at Ulysses. We conclude that the two spacecraft see

the same event.

Cases 1 and 2 also pass ACE and Ulysses successively and are both associated with alpha

enhancements.

Interestingly, the GS reconstruction shows that the ﬁrst case contains

two nested ﬂux ropes in both the ACE and Ulysses measurements. ACE and Ulysses

are roughly aligned in longitude for the second case, and their observations also show

Alfv´enic ﬂuctuations around the MC. We show the propagation of the data from 1 AU

to Ulysses in Figure 4. Larger streams at 1 AU persist to Ulysses while smaller ones

smooth out. The model outputs at Ulysses agree well with the observed speed proﬁles

for the two cases. Note that the model-predicted and observed speeds were not shifted to

produce this agreement. The MCs’ surroundings at Ulysses are also similar to their 1 AU

situations, based on the good stream alignment.

As demonstrated above, the MCs listed in Table 1 give direct observational evidence

for the large transverse size. The latitudinal separation (∆θ) between ACE and Ulysses

displayed in Figure 5 serves as a measure of the transverse size expressed as

St = R∆θ,

(8)

where R is the heliocentric distance of the MCs at Ulysses. This equation explicitly as-

sumes that the latitudinal extent of the MCs is constant during their propagation through

the solar wind. The transverse size given by the above equation is much larger than the

MCs’ radial width obtained from their average speed multiplied by the time duration.

As can seen from Figure 5, the largest aspect ratio is 15.6:1. The PR event has a ratio

of 2.6:1 since ∆θ is only 15.3◦ for this case. Figure 5 reveals that the MCs have a cross

section greatly elongated in the latitudinal direction.

The large transverse size can be inferred from the shock standoﬀ distance d ahead of

fast MCs written as [Russell and Mulligan, 2002]

d
L

= 0.41

(γ − 1)M 2 + 2
(γ + 1)(M 2 − 1)

,

where γ = 5

3, M is the Mach number of the preceding shock, and L is the characteristic

scale of MCs, presumably a measure of St. From the superposed epoch data of 18 near-

Earth MCs with preceding shocks in Liu et al.

[2006, Figure 8], we have M = 3.4 and

d = 0.17 AU on average. Substitution of these values into the above equation gives

D R A F T

December 27, 2012, 11:05pm

D R A F T

X - 14

LIU ET AL.: GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF MCS

L = 1.2 AU, which corresponds to a latitudinal extent of ∼ 69◦ obtained from equation 8.

Consistent with our direct evidence, the transverse size of MCs (or ICMEs in general)

could be very large.

4. Curvature of Magnetic Clouds

A direct consequence of the large transverse size is that MCs experience diﬀerent solar

wind ﬂows in the meridianal plane. MCs can thus be highly distorted depending on the

ambient solar wind. As described in section 1, MCs should be concave outward at solar

minimum and convex outward during solar maximum. This curvature eﬀect results in

an inverse correlation between δ and θ at solar minimum and a positive correlation near

solar maximum as shown by equation 1. Note that deviations from this ideal picture can

certainly occur due to solar wind complications.

As discussed in section 2, the distortion eﬀect by solar wind ﬂows would be most promi-

nent if MCs have axes close to the solar equator and perpendicular to the radial direction.

In order to have enough events, we include all the MCs whose axes lie within 30◦ of the

solar equatorial plane and more than 30◦ away from the radial direction.

4.1. MCs in a Structured Solar Wind

Close to solar minimum, the solar wind is bi-modal with fast wind leaving the Sun at

high latitudes and slow wind near the equator. Wind observations from 1995 - 1997 are

used to assess the distortion eﬀect of the latitudinal ﬂow gradient on MCs. Figure 6 shows

the normal elevation angles for 14 events resulting from the above prescription during this

time period. The error bars are obtained from equation 5. A good inverse correlation can

be seen between δ and θ, except for three events (i.e., δ and θ have the same sign). One of

the exceptions, the 1997 May 15 event, is numerically simulated by Odstrcil et al. [2004]

using an MHD coronal solution to obtain the ambient solar wind state. Their simulation

gave a concave-outward ﬂux rope (the right curvature at solar minimum). Inspection of

the data reveals an increasing speed proﬁle across the 1997 May 15 MC, which implies

that the event is pushed from behind by a high-speed stream. As a result, the MC was

bent in the opposite manner. While useful for interpreting the general trend of curvature

close to solar minimum, the MHD modeling might oversimplify the background solar wind

condition for a speciﬁc event. Note that our model assumes a minimum solar wind speed

at the solar equator. It is conceivable that δ and θ may have the same sign if the minimum

speed shifts away from the zero latitude. Although the breakdown of the assumption is a

possible explanation for the other two exceptions, this eﬀect may be negligible since most

of the events in Figure 6 have the inverse correlation. The best ﬁt to the data that show

the inverse correlation, obtained with a least squares analysis of equation 1, gives a radius

of curvature of −0.3 AU. Compared with the convex-outward representation (dashed line),

the data clearly show the trend pictured by the right panel of Figure 1.

4.2. MCs in a Uniform-Speed Solar Wind

At solar maximum, the solar wind speed would tend to be uniform over heliographic

latitude. MCs at the near-Earth spacecraft do not have a deﬁnite trend in curvature,

which may be due to the presence of the heliospheric plasma sheet, a slower and denser

region in the solar wind. MHD simulations show that the plasma sheet could squeeze the

ﬂux rope and lead to a dimple in its nose both in a uniform solar wind [e.g., Riley et

al. 2003] and in a bi-modal wind [e.g., Manchester et al., 2004]. A similar indentation

can also form in a shock front when it encounters the plasma sheet [e.g., Odstrcil et al.,

D R A F T

December 27, 2012, 11:05pm

D R A F T

X - 16

LIU ET AL.: GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF MCS

1996]. It is likely that the near-Earth spacecraft frequently observe a dimple embedded in

a much larger convex structure of MCs at solar maximum. This contamination eﬀect may

not allow us to see the global convex-outward structure of MCs through the near-Earth

spacecraft.

We use Ulysses observations between 1999 and 2003 to quantify the curvature eﬀect

of solar wind spherical expansion on MCs. Our prescription yields 13 events shown in

Figure 7. In a uniform solar wind the MCs would have a radius of curvature equal to

their distance from the Sun, which results in a proportional relationship, i.e., δ = θ from

equation 1. Only two events do not have a positive correlation. More speciﬁcally, δ and θ

have opposite signs for the two events. They are the ﬁrst and last ones in the time series

of the MCs; as indicated by the dates, they may not truly come from the solar maximum

environment. The data nearby the δ = θ curve (dashed line) manifest a convex-outward

structure at solar maximum as illustrated by the left panel of Figure 1.

5. Summary and Discussion

We have investigated the transverse size and curvature of the MC cross section, based

on ACE, Wind and Ulysses observations. The results provide compelling evidence that

MCs are highly stretched in the latitudinal direction and curved in a fashion depending

on the background solar wind.

Three MCs, whose axes are close to the solar equator and roughly perpendicular to

the radial direction, are shown to pass ACE and Ulysses (widely separated in latitude)

successively. The MVA method combined with the GS reconstruction technique is used

to determine the axis orientation, and the observations at ACE and Ulysses are linked

using a 1-D MHD model. The latitudinal separation between ACE and Ulysses gives

a lower limit to the MCs’ transverse size. Varying from 40 to 70◦, it reveals that the

transverse size can be very large. The ﬂattened cross section is a natural result of a ﬂux

rope subtending a constant angle as it propagates from the Sun through the heliosphere

(see Figure 1).

The radius of curvature is obtained from a simple relationship between the MC normal

elevation angle and the latitude of an observing spacecraft. The curvature of MCs in the

solar wind with a latitudinal speed gradient at solar minimum diﬀers from that in the

uniform-speed solar wind near solar maximum. At solar minimum, MCs are bent concave-

outward by the structured solar wind with a radius of curvature of about 0.3 AU; at solar

maximum, they tend to be convex outward with the radius of curvature proportional to

their heliographic distance. The distortion of MCs, resulting from the interaction with

the ambient solar wind, is mainly a kinematic eﬀect since magnetic forces are dominated

by the ﬂow momentum [Riley and Crooker, 2004].

Improvement of our knowledge of the global structure of MCs (or generic ICMEs) is

of critical importance for heliosphere physics and space weather prediction. Estimates of

the magnetic ﬂux and helicity of ICMEs are needed to quantify their connection with the

coronal origin and to assess the modulation of heliospheric ﬂux by CMEs. The existing

ﬂux-rope models, based on a single spacecraft cut through the large structure, may not

capture the true dimension and distortion of ICMEs. The ﬂux content and helicity can

be signiﬁcantly underestimated since these quantities are highly sensitive to the ﬂux-rope

scale. The large transverse size and curvature can alter the global conﬁguration of the

interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld as ICMEs sweep the heliosphere. Numerical simulations

show that the ambient magnetic ﬁeld extending from the Sun to high latitudes may

bend poleward to warp around the ﬂattened ﬂux rope [e.g., Manchester et al., 2005], as

initially proposed by Gosling and McComas [1987] and McComas et al. [1988]. The ﬁeld

line draping leads to favorable conditions for the formation of plasma depletion layers

and mirror mode instabilities in the sheath region of fast ICMEs [Liu et al., 2006b]. A

magnetic ﬁeld bent southward would also allow for strong coupling between the solar

wind and the magnetosphere via ﬁeld line merging [Dungey, 1961]. Conforming with the

transverse size, the sheath region acts as a huge screen responsible for galactic cosmic ray

modulation and energetic particle acceleration [e.g., Badruddin et al., 1991; Manchester

et al., 2005]. The curvature of ICMEs could modify the shape of preceding shock fronts,

aﬀecting plasma ﬂows and particle acceleration at the shocks.

How general ICMEs are distorted remains unaddressed. Since their magnetic ﬁeld is

not well organized, the diﬃculty resides in how to best estimate their axis orientation.

Future Stereo observations will provide perspectives for their geometry and also quantita-

tively test our results for MCs. Interestingly, the magnetic ﬁeld within some ICMEs with

low density and/or ﬁeld strength also has a signature of rotation but is rather turbulent;

the turbulent manifestation in the maximum variance plane is scatter deviating from the

rotation trace. These ICMEs can be termed as expanded MCs (EMCs). A good example

of EMCs is the 2001 April 1 event at ACE (not shown here); three days later it is ob-

served at Ulysses, and the ﬁeld becomes even more turbulent. As Kumar and Rust [1996]

suggested, an expanding ﬂux rope loses magnetic energy which may be dissipated as heat.

The evolution of turbulence within the EMC leads us to conjecture the expansion and

interaction with the ambient solar wind as a possible mechanism for turbulence generation

inside ICMEs which has been sought by Liu et al. [2006a].

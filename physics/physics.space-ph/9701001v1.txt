Pick-up ion dynamics at the structured
quasi-perpendicular shock

Abstract

We study the pickup ion dynamics and mechanism of multiple reﬂection and acceleration at
the structured quasi-perpendicular supercritical shock. The motion of the pickup ions in the
shock is studied analytically and numerically using the test particle analysis in the model
shock front. The analysis shows that slow pickup ions may be accelerated at the shock
ramp to high energies. The maximum ion energy is determined by the ﬁne structure of the
electro-magnetic ﬁeld at the shock ramp and decreases when the angle between magnetic
ﬁeld and shock normal decreases. Evolution of pickup ion distribution across the nearly-
perpendicular shock and pickup ion spectrum is also studied by direct numerical analysis.

1 Introduction

Interstellar pickup ions play an important role in the physics of the outer helio-
sphere. They may modify both the large scale characteristics of the solar wind it-
self [1,2] and smaller scale solar wind structures such as interplanetary collisionless
shock waves [3]. On the basis of the studies of the low-energy cosmic rays it was
proposed that the cosmic ray anomalous component originates from the interstellar
pickup ions, accelerated at the quasi-perpendicular shocks [4,5].

The observations, made by Ulysses at 4.5AU [6], have revealed accelerated inter-
stellar pickup ions across the forward shock in the corotating interaction regions. It
has been found that the injection efﬁciency for these pickup ions exceeds that one
for solar wind ions, and that the accelerated pickup ions have power-law energetic
spectra in the solar wind frame [6]. Earlier investigations of the quasi-perpendicular
cometary bow shocks have observed water-group pickup ions with speeds of sev-
eral times the solar wind speed vu at and downstream of the shock[7,8].

Process of pickup ions production and features of the pickup ion distribution in the
solar wind are studied quite well. Neutral atoms and molecules, penetrating from

the local interstellar medium or escaping from comets, are ionized by photoioniza-
tion, electron impact or charge exchange with the solar wind. Under inﬂuence of
the solar wind electro-magnetic ﬁeld the ions compose ring-beam distribution in
velocity space. Then they are scattered by ambient and excited Alfvenic ﬂuctua-
tions to form spherical shell distribution, centered approximately at the solar wind
velocity with a radius of about solar wind speed Vu [9,10].

Accelerated pickup ions were observed at quasi-perpendicular shocks, which are
not able to accelerate incident thermal ions and pick up ions by the standard dif-
fusive shock (Fermi) acceleration mechanism [11]. The mechanism requires ions
which can penetrate the shock front in both directions. At quasi-perpendicular
shocks it may occur when the ion velocity near the shock ramp is higher than a
deﬁnite threshold speed, which signiﬁcantly exceeds the solar wind speed [11,12].
Hence, in order that pick up ions may be accelerated by the diffusive mechanisms,
some preacceleration mechanism at quasi-perpendicular shocks must exist. In [3],
a detailed discussion was presented of the following idea for the ion acceleration
at a perpendicular shock proposed by [13]: if the ion encounters the shock with
normal kinetic energy miv2
n/2 much smaller than the electrostatic potential eϕ0 at
the shock, and the upstream Lorentz force is directed toward the shock, then the
ion ﬁnds itself trapped between the shock potential and the Lorentz force. Such
ion is multiply reﬂected at the shock front and during each excursion to the up-
stream region it gains some energy until it is able to overcome the shock, when
miv2
n/2 > eϕ0 or the Lorentz force in the normal direction exceeds the elec-
trostatic force in the ramp. This idea for pickup ion preacceleration at the quasi-
perpendicular shock has been developed further by several authors. Analytical es-
timates show that at the perpendicular shock the maximum energy gain for trans-
mitted ions is proportional to the ratio of an solar wind ion gyroradius to the small-
est characteristic scale of the electrostatic potential [3]. At the quasi-perpendicular
shock maximum energy gain occurs when the ion escapes back into the upstream
region [14]. The multiple reﬂection ion acceleration gives very hard power law
spectrum [3]. The spectrum is weakly sensitive to the shock parameters and may
0.5MeV. Thus the injection problem associated with Fermi
extend to energy
acceleration probably, may be solved by the multiple reﬂection ion acceleration
mechanism.

∼

In the present paper we study the details of the multiple reﬂected ion acceleration
mechanism in the stationary structured quasi-perpendicular supercritical shock and
determine the shock parameters, which control the pickup ion energy gain. We
also consider evolution of the pickup ion distribution across the strong shock. Our
approach differs from earlier ones in that we use ﬁeld models qualitatively describ-
ing the actual structure of the stationary ﬁelds at quasi-perpendicular super-critical
shocks which consists of the extended foot, narrow ramp, overshoot and down-
stream region. In section 2 we consider analytically the pickup ion motion at the
shock front and derive the multiple reﬂection condition as a function of the ﬁeld
parameters. In section 3 we numerically analyze the ion motion in the stationary

2

model shock front. The analysis illustrates the analytical consideration of multi-
ple reﬂection process developed in section 2 and provides additional information
about the process. The method also allows diagnostics of pickup ion distribution at
the shock and of pickup ion spectra before the ramp and in the far upstream and
downstream regions.

2 Pickup ion dynamics in the shock front

When studying the pickup ion dynamics in the shock front we adopt the usual
assumptions that the shock is one-dimensional and stationary. In doing so we do
not consider the effects of, for example, possible rippling of the shock surface or
interaction with waves, assuming that the stationary electric and magnetic ﬁelds in
the shock front determine the ion behavior (see, however, discussion in sec. 4).

We shall work in the normal incidence frame (N), where the upstream plasma ve-
locity is along the shock normal. Let us choose the coordinates in such a way that
the normal is along x axis which is directed toward the downstream region (in [14]
x axis was directed toward the upstream region), upstream and downstream mag-
netic ﬁelds are in xz plane, and the noncoplanarity direction is along y axis. Then
the ion motion is governed by the following equations of motion:

mi ˙vx = e(Ex + vyBz −
mi ˙vy = e(Ey + vzBx −
vyBx),
mi ˙vz = e(vxBy −

vzBy),
vxBz),

(1)
(2)
(3)

dφ/dx depend only on x, while Bx = const, and the
where By, Bz, and Ex =
motional electric ﬁeld Ey = VuBu sin θ = const (where Vu is the upstream ﬂow
speed). Here subscript u denotes asymptotically homogeneous upstream param-
eters, and θ is the angle between the shock normal and upstream magnetic ﬁeld
vector.

−

The qualitative proﬁle of the magnetic ﬁeld is known quite well. It is usually
0.5(Vu/Ωu) (where
considered [15] to consist of the extended foot with Lf ∼
Ωu = eBu/mi is the upstream ion gyrofrequency), on which the magnetic ﬁeld
Bz gradually increases by the amount of . Bu. It is followed by the narrow ramp
with the width c/ωpi > Lr > c/ωpe, where the main magnetic ﬁeld Bz jump occurs,
and magnetic overshoot and probably large downstream magnetic ﬁeld oscillations.
The noncoplanar magnetic ﬁeld component By is always small relative to Bz, and
negligible upstream. Substantial component of pickup ions may affect the shock
proﬁle and alter the typical scales (see detail discussion in [3]). Here we consider
pickup ions as a low density test particle population.

The electric ﬁeld proﬁle is known much worse. It is distributed over the whole

3

shock front including foot, ramp, and overshoot, and penetrates into the down-
stream region, so that only a part of the total cross-shock potential is applied at
the ramp.The qualitative picture of the quasi-perpendicular shock front is shown in
Figure 1.

An ion with a low kinetic energy in x direction (miv2
x/2 << eφ) is unable to over-
come the electrostatic potential at the ramp and is reﬂected back to the upstream
region. If vyBz > 0, upstream Lorentz force returns it to the ramp again. In this
way the ion becomes trapped near the ramp and quickly oscillates in x direction
until it escapes upstream or downstream region [3,14].

It does not seem possible to solve (and even analyze quantitatively) the ion equa-
tions of motion (1)-(3) in the general case of Figure 1. Instead we shall analyze
them for the case of surﬁng ions, which are assumed to be trapped in the ramp
vicinity. To do so we make an assumption (veriﬁed aposteriori) that these ions os-
cillate quickly in x direction, while two other velocity components vary slowly on
the oscillation period (such behavior can be expected since strong ion acceleration
is possible only when Ey acts on the ion for a substantially long time). In this case
separating fast and slow motion, one has:

where (4) describes fast oscillations along x, while (5) and (6) describe slow motion
in yz plane. The effective potential

weakly depends on time via slow time-dependence of vy and vz. Further simpli-
ﬁcation can be achieved by consideration a model proﬁle, where B = Bu and
E = (0, Ey, 0) before the ramp, and Taylor expanding up to the ﬁrst order

It is worth mentioning that in this picture the ions experience reﬂection in which
their noncoplanar velocity vx does not change, while others (vx and vz) change their
sign in HT.

It should be mentioned that the above analysis is approximate (since the shock pro-
ﬁle is treated in a speciﬁc model) and applies only to those ions which are trapped
and subsequently either transmit downstream and do not appear at the ramp any-
more or escape upstream. The analysis is not able to catch trajectories which do
not meet these assumptions and we have to consider them numerically in the next
section. We also do not consider here the ions which experience the shock drift
acceleration (cf. [3]).

3 Numerical analysis.

In order to illustrate the above theoretical analysis and study the features, which
cannot be studied analytically, we perform a test particle numerical analysis of
pickup ion trajectories in a model shock front, which is taken to resemble the ob-
served shock proﬁles, as in Figure 1. The corresponding model analytical form for
the ﬁelds is taken as proposed by [16]:

(Do + Dd) (it should be noted that here for convenience x = 0 corresponds to
the middle of the ramp). The noncoplanar component By is in agreement with the
results of [17,18]. The suggested analytical proﬁle of the cross-shock electric ﬁeld
consists of the well-known hydrodynamical part (ﬁrst two terms) for polytropic
electrons, and additional Gaussian to take into account the penetration of the ﬁeld
in deep downstream and foot and provide the observed values of the total cross-
shock potential drop. For the speciﬁc needs of the present paper the parameters
were chosen as follows: Rf = 1.5, Rr = 5, Ro = 6, Rd = 3.2, Df = 0.3(Vu/Ωu),
Dr = 0.01(Vu/Ωu) (this parameter was varied, see below), Do = 0.1(Vu/Ωu),
Dd = 0.15(Vu/Ωu), and γe = 2. We chose to examine a high-Mach number MA =
7.5.

Pickup ion trajectories are traced through the described shock front starting at the
upstream edge of the foot x =
Df . Figure 2 presents the ion trajectories pro-
jected onto the xy-plane at the quasi-perpendicular shock with θ = 70◦. A variety
of pickup ion trajectories are seen: 1) ions which are directly transmitted down-
stream, 2) ions which cross the ramp from downstream to upstream once or several
times, 3) ions which are reﬂected in the ramp only once, 4) ions which are accel-
erated by multiple reﬂection mechanism and then escape either to downstream or
to upstream, and 5) multiply reﬂected ions which rotate around the ramp until they
escape upstream.

Next several ﬁgures provide more qualitative details about the multiple reﬂection
(trapping) process.Figure 3 shows the trajectory of an ion which is transmitted
downstream after several reﬂections. It is seen that at each next encounter with the
ramp the ion penetrates into the ramp more deeply, while both vx and vy increase,
until the ion crosses the ramp at the maximum of vy and drifts downstream having a
high gyration velocity. The initial ion energy is about miV 2
u /2, and it is accelerated
to about four times higher downstream energy in four cycles of reﬂection.

Figure 4 shows the trajectory of an ion which escapes upstream after making a
full cycle of multiple reﬂections, during which vy increases and decreases again.
Figure 4a shows that the ion trajectory does not cross the middle of the ramp. From
Figure 4b one can see that the amplitude of oscillations of vx is roughly proportional
to vy, that is, the adiabatic approximation works quite well. It is seen also that the
vy plane: vy is the same
reﬂection-escape process is indeed almost specular in vx −
at the entry and escape points, while vx changes its sign. As can be seen from
Figure 4c, vz in the last escape point closely corresponds to (32).

Figure 5 shows the trajectory which is not covered by the above theoretical anal-
ysis. The ion is trapped near the ramp for some time and afterwards it becomes
trapped around the ramp, making several large amplitude gyrations and crossing
the shock front back and forth. Eventually it escapes upstream (high negative ﬁnal
vz in Figure 5c) having a substantial gyration velocity.

Figure 6a shows which part of the initial pickup ion distribution undergoes multi-
ple reﬂection (for perpendicular shock geometry). In Figure 6b we show the same
distribution of incident pickup ions at the upstream edge of the ramp, where it is
already strongly disturbed. Almost all multiply reﬂected ions are taken from the
low vx part of the distribution, in agreement with previous theoretical observations
[3,14]. Most of them have substantial positive vy at their entry to the ramp, as is
expected according to the analytical consideration.

The next several ﬁgures present the evolution of the pickup ion distribution across
the structured shock front. In Figure 7 we present the pickup ion distributions ob-
tained numerically by tracing the initial shell distribution (38) across the perpen-

9

−

−

0.6(Vu/Ωu), (b) at the upstream edge of the ramp x =

dicular shock. The distributions are plotted for several positions: (a) before the foot
at x =
0.005(Vu/Ωu),
(c) at the downstream edge of the ramp x = 0.005(Vu/Ωu), and (d) far downstream
at x = 5(Vu/Ωu). The ion distribution before the foot (Figure 7a) consists of the
incident pickup ion shell and ions which are reﬂected in the way similar to the
reﬂection of the ions from the wings of the thermal ion distribution [16]. The ion
distribution at the upstream edge of the ramp (Figure 7b) includes these reﬂected
ions and much more energetic trapped accelerated ions, which are seen also just
behind the ramp in Figure 7c (only those which crossed the ramp and are transmit-
ted further downstream). Far downstream distribution (Figure 7d) consists of low
energy reﬂected ions and high energy multiply reﬂected ones. Since there is not gy-
rophase mixing in the perpendicular shock (all ions have the same downstream drift
velocity) the downstream distribution is spatially dependent (actually periodic).

Figure 8 present the evolution of pick up ion distribution across the nearly per-
pendicular θ = 80◦ shock. For each position both vx, vy and vy, vz projections are
shown. The distribution before the foot (Figures 8a and 8b) differs from that one
in the perpendicular case (Figure 7a) only by presence of ions which escaped up-
stream (high negative vz). The upstream edge distribution (Figures 8c and 8d) also
shows presence of these escaping ions. The multiply reﬂected ions in Figure 8d lie
on two semicircles, corresponding to the slow rotation in vy, vz plane (see (5) and
(6)), separately for positive and negative initial vz. The most remarkable difference
from the perpendicular case can be seen in the downstream distribution (Figures 8g
and 8h), which shows strong phase mixing. The downstream accelerated pickup
ions are situated on two (almost) hemispheres, corresponding to the rotation of the
semi-circles in Figure 8f.

The numerical analysis allows also to obtain the differential energy spectra of ac-
celerated ions. Figure 9 shows the far upstream (Figure 9a) and far downstream
(Figure 9b) ion energy spectra dN/dǫ,

where ǫ is the dimensionless ion energy, ǫ = (miv2/2)/(miV 2
u /2). The far up-
stream spectrum consists of the dense population of incident ions (dN/dǫ = const)
and low density high energy component of accelerated ions which escaped up-
stream for two different angles between the shock normal: θ = 80◦ (dotted line)
and θ = 70◦ (dashed line). With the decrease of the angle the number of escape
ions (Figure 9a) increases but their energy decreases. One can see also the drastic
drop of acceleration efﬁciency with the increase of obliquity in the downstream dis-
tribution of pickup ions, where the highest energy of accelerated ions drops from
u /2) to slightly higher than 101 when the angle decreases from 80◦ to
102 (in miV 2
70◦.

Figure 10 shows the accelerated pickup ion distribution just before the ramp and far

10

downstream for two values of the total cross-shock potential. As could be expected,
the acceleration efﬁciency decreases with the decrease of the potential, although
this decrease is almost not noticeable in the far downstream distribution because
of the logarithmic scale. It is clearly seen that the distribution is nearly exponential
0.020 for the po-
dN/dǫ
tential ϕ = 0.7(miV 2
u /2). The downstream
distributions reveal power spectra dN/dǫ
3/2 and is almost in-
dependent of the cross-shock potential. The result is in conformity with the power
low tail in energy produced by multiply reﬂected ion acceleration at strong perpen-
dicular shock found in [3].

Dependence of the accelerated ion spectra on the ramp width is shown in Fig-
ure 11, where the upstream-ramp-edge and far downstream spectra are presented
for the ramp width Dr = 0.01(Vu/Ωu) (solid line) and Dr = 0.03(Vu/Ωu) (dotted
line). As is expected, the acceleration efﬁciency drops drastically when the sock
becomes wider. It could be expected, however, that any substructure in the ramp
would enhance the acceleration, as can be seen from Figure 12, where the ion spec-
tra are compared for the case of Dr = 0.03(Vu/Ωu) without (dotted line) and with
a substructure (dashed line). Presence of such internal substructure plays the role
of a narrow ramp.

It is worth to mention that our approach allows also to study the behavior of heavy
ions. Figure 13 presents the results of such analysis, comparing the downstream
spectra of ions with the mass mi = 4mp (which would correspond to He+ ions) and
mi = 15mp (O+). The initial distribution is the same pickup ion shell as for the case
mi = mp, considered throughout the paper. It can be seen that the acceleration is
less efﬁcient for heavy ions than for protons (Figures 9b and 10b). Detailed analysis
of the heavy ion behavior is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be
presented elsewhere.

4 Conclusions

We have considered the surﬁng mechanism of the pickup ion energization at strong
high-Mach number quasi-perpendicular shocks. The distribution of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld at the shock front determines the ion motion across the shock,and
the ion reﬂection and acceleration processes depend on the details of the ﬁne struc-
ture of the shock front. We had to make a choice of the shock structure in order to
determine quantitatively the features of the accelerated ions and their dependence
on the shock parameters. It is clear that a deviation of the actual shock structure
from the model adopted here would give somewhat different quantitative results,
which cannot be predicted unless we know proﬁles of the ﬁelds at the shock. How-
ever, some tendencies can be predicted on the basis of the analytical and numerical
investigations represented in sections 2 and 3.

The conditions for the multiple ion reﬂection and the maximum energy gain are
determined by the slope of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles at the ramp and
therefore very sensitive to the ramp width. For the chosen model the scales of the
Dr. The analytical con-
magnetic and electric ﬁeld variations are the same and
sideration gives the following estimate for the maximum downstream ion energy in
the nearly perpendicular shock (see also [14,3]):

where φ = eϕ/(miV 2
u /2), R = Bzr/Bu (where Bzr is z component of the magnetic
ﬁeld at the downstream edge of the ramp), and Dr is measured in Vu/Ωu. For the
0.01(Vu/Ωu), cross-shock
initial ion energy of
= 1keV, ramp width of Dr ≈
potential φ = 0.5, and magnetic compression ratio R = 2.5, one ﬁnds
Emax ≈
1MeV, which is probably sufﬁcient for injection into diffusive acceleration regime.

Since the efﬁciency is
r and decreases with the increase of obliquity, the pick
up ion injection for Fermi acceleration mechanism seems to be effective only at
nearly-perpendicular shocks waves with very narrow ramp or when some substruc-
ture is present which reduced the effective width of the ramp.

∝

The dependence of the acceleration features on the Mach number is determined
mostly by the dependence of the shock width and magnetic compression ratio on
the Mach number. In the absence of a satisfactory theory, which could provide these
dependencies, the only conclusion is that the mechanism efﬁciency should rapidly
decrease with the decrease of the Mach number because of the shock widening.

ǫ−3/2 (see also [3]),
The obtained model downstream accelerated ion spectra
v−2 (and is in agreement with earlier studies), is
which corresponds to f (v)
harder than v−4 that is observed. This discrepancy may be probably attributed to
the mentioned deviation of the actual shock structure from the adopted model.

∝

∝

It should be mentioned that, due to the high sensitivity of the trapping-detrapping
mechanisms to the details of the magnetic and electric ﬁelds in the ramp, it could
be in principle affected by even relatively weak deviations from stationarity (for ex-
ample, presence of large amplitude waves in the ramp) or one-dimensionality (like
rippling of the shock surface), as well as presence of any small-scale substructure
inside the ramp. Observation evidence is not unambiguous, and the effect of such
deviations from the model is not clear apriori and requires special study which is
beyond the scope of the present paper.

In summary, the analysis allowed to shed additional light on the importance of
the small-scale structure of the shock front (in particular, high gradients of the
electric ﬁeld) for the ion acceleration processes. The test particle numerical analysis
allowed to determine the details of ion behavior and the spatial and energetical
distribution of accelerated ions in the shock front.

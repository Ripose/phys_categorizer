The interplanetary induced electric ﬁeld e = v

b is studied, using solar wind time series.

The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the electric ﬁeld components are measured from

the data and their non-gaussianity is discussed. Moreover, for the ﬁrst time we show that the

electric ﬁeld turbulence is characterized by intermittency. This point is addressed by studying, as

usual, the scaling of the PDFs of ﬁeld increments, which allows a quantitative characterization of

intermittency.

INTRODUCTION

Solar wind provides a great opportunity to get “in situ” observations of a magnetized

plasma on a wide range of scales.

In fact, many spacecrafts have been launched in the

interplanetary space during past years, in order to study the properties of plasma. The

low-frequency turbulence of the wind can be described in the framework of the magnetohy-

drodynamics (MHD) model of plasma (see for example [1, 2] for ordinary ﬂuid and MHD

turbulence). Turbulent high amplitude ﬂuctuations have been observed from data, and it

is well known now that solar wind plasma is in a highly turbulent state [3, 4]. Studies of

solar wind turbulence have been mainly focused on the analysis of velocity and magnetic

ﬁeld data, for example observing the power spectra of such ﬁelds [5], and later studying the

anomalous statistics of the ﬁelds ﬂuctuations, which revealed intermittency ([3, 6, 7, 8]).

Only recently attention has been paid to the measurements of the interplanetary induced
b (v and b being respectively the measured velocity and mag-
electric ﬁeld (IEF) e = v

×

netic ﬁeld). Breech et al. [9] reported on the statistics of IEF collected from many diﬀerent

spacecrafts spanning 30 years of measurements. They analysed the one-point probability
distribution functions (PDFs) of the IEF ﬂuctuations e′ = v′
b′ (computed as a Reynolds
decomposition, e. g. v = V0 + v′), and they found that such PDFs have exponential tails.

×

This has been interpreted through a recent analytical result [10]. These authors showed that,

a ﬁeld that can be written as φ = ξ1ξ2

ξ3ξ4, where ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4 are independent stochastic

−

variables with gaussian PDF, has exponential PDF. The cases of “dynamo-type” and “cross

helicity-type” correlated gaussian PDFs for the ξ’s are also shown to give a modiﬁed expo-

nential PDF for φ. Since the interplanetary velocity and magnetic ﬁeld components PDFs

are roughly gaussian, results in [9] suggest that the data analysed by these authors satisfy

the hypotheses on correlation required in [10].

In this letter we present a somewhat diﬀerent data analysis, by considering the main
statistical properties of the IEF e itself as computed from a more homogeneous dataset.

At a variance with the IEF ﬂuctuations, we will see how correlations play a key role in

invalidating the assumptions for the above results to hold, despite the fact that, from the
same dataset, the same results as in [9] are retrived for the IEF ﬂuctuations e′. We then

investigate for the ﬁrst time the intermittency of interplanetary IEF, which we expect to

owe similar properties as for the interplanetary velocity and magnetic ﬁeld. We do that

2

through the analysis of the scaling laws of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations across diﬀerent scales, which

gives informations about the nonlinear processes undergoing the turbulent cascades of the

ideal invariants of the ﬂow. Our results give a quantitative characterization of intermittency,

which was not yet present in the literature.

II. THE INTERPLANETARY INDUCED ELECTRIC FIELD

In order to study the statistical properties of the solar wind induced electric ﬁeld, we

use the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds, as measured in situ by the spacecraft Helios 2 (1976).

Helios 2 orbit lied in the ecliptic plane, so that the measured data include both fast and slow

wind streams. Since the physical conditions are very diﬀerent, we analyse separately six fast

and ﬁve slow wind streams [4, 8]. This separation lead to more homogeneous data sets,

although the radial evolution is not taken into account here. After separating the streams,

and rejecting the velocity boundary regions between streams, which include undesired shear
eﬀects, the original dataset reduces to two sets of about 105 points each. The sampling

time is 81 seconds, and each stream consists of 2187 points, so that we can investigate

scaling in a range from about one minute up to one day. First of all, we compute the IEF
b(t), where v(t) is the measured velocity ﬁeld, and b(t) is the measured
as e(t) = v(t)

×

magnetic ﬁeld. The choice of the reference frame is not trivial. In fact, when analysing the

velocity ﬁeld the “natural” reference frame is the SE (with the x axis along the sun-earth

direction, which coincides with the mean velocity). On the other hand, the “natural” frame

for the magnetic ﬁeld is with the x axis along the mean ﬁeld line, which is directed like

the Parker’s spiral, and evolves with the heliocentric distance. Note that z axis lies on the

ecliptic plane, while z axis is choosen as normal to the ecliptic plane. Since we have no

arguments to decide whether a frame is better than the other in describing turbulent eﬀects

when analysing the induced electric ﬁeld, we perform the analysis using both frames, and

we compare the results. In ﬁgure 1 we present the PDFs of the electric ﬁeld. In order to

compare the shape of the PDFs we have previously translated and normalized the variables

to their standard deviation, so that all PDFs have zero mean and unit standard deviation.

The plots refer to the ﬁeld components in V0 and B0 frames. The PDFs for the y and z

components are roughly gaussians for both frames, and the same holds for the magnitude

. The x component, aligned either to the radial direction (ev) or to the mean ﬁeld (eb),

and in slow wind, the electric ﬁeld component along B0 is distributed as a gaussian. On

the other side, the PDFs of the electric ﬁeld component aligned to V0 show exponetial tails,

as observed for all components ﬂuctuations in [9]. These observations can be quantitatively

ﬂatness computed from data are in the range 2.4–3.4, except for the electric ﬁeld component

along the bulk velocity (radial direction) which has F = 7.1, for fast and F = 7.7 for slow

wind. This conﬁrm the direct observation of the PDFs. It is worth noting that no diﬀerence

can be seen here between fast and slow streams. However, the separation in fast and slow

streams allow for a comparison between more homogeneous datasets. We note here that the

rotation of the reference frame do not aﬀect the y and z components, so we only report here

the results obtained in the bulk velocity frame.

In order to compare our datasets with the one used in Ref. [9], we also analysed the
statistics of the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations e′. Our results (not shown) are in agreement with [9],

namely, we ﬁnd exponential PDFs for all components, and with no remarkable diﬀerences

between the diﬀerent reference frames.

III.

INTERMITTENCY

In recent years, the solar wind velocity and magnetic ﬁeld intermittency has been studied

in detail by several autors [8, 11]. One suitable approach to intermittency is the study of the

ﬁelds increments [1], deﬁned as δψℓ(r) = ψ(r + ℓ)

ψ(r). Such variables are used to describe

−

the presence of structures of the ﬁeld ψ(r) at a given scale ℓ, as for example eddies, shears,

strong gradients, shocks and so on. Thus, the statistical properties of the ﬁeld increments

can give informations about the turbulent energy cascade mechanism, responsible for the

emergence of structures on a wide range of scales. In this paper we show that the induced

electric ﬁeld as measured in the solar wind plasma is characterized by intermittency. To

this aim, we compute the PDFs of the increments δeτ , where the temporal lags τ = ℓ/

i
are used instead of the lenght scales ℓ via the Taylor hypothesis. The intermittency eﬀects

v

h

can be observed as the departure from scaling invariance of the normalized PDFs of the

ﬁeld increments [12]. Figure 3 shows the distributions P (δeτ ) for the slow wind, computed

for three diﬀerent values of the scale. The PDFs clearly display intermittency. In order to

investigate more quantitatively such behavior, we can analyse the scale dependence of the

ﬂatness (see above). Figure 2 reports the values of the ﬂatness of the induced electric ﬁeld

components and magnitude increments, for both fast and slow wind. As can be seen, the

small scale increments have high ﬂatness, while the gaussian value F = 3 is recovered as

the scale increases. This does not hold for the radial component of the ﬁeld, for which the

asymptotic value of F at large scales is considerably higher than for the other components.

This is easily understood considering that the large scale PDF should reproduce the one-

point statistics of the ﬁeld, which is not gaussian for the ev component, as we have shown

before. The values of the small scale ﬂatness are also higher for the slow wind than for the fast

wind. This indicates a higher intermittency in slow wind electric ﬁeld, and is in accord with

previous results on velocity and magnetic ﬁeld (see e. g. [8]). For a better characterization

of intermittency, we use a model for PDF scaling to ﬁt the measured distributions, and

then study the scaling properties of the parameters obtained from such model [13]. The

model PDF we use here has already been adopted to investigate intermittency in solar wind

velocity and magnetic ﬁeld, for example in Refs. [8, 11]. Here we shortly describe the main

idea underlying the model, and we address the reader to the quoted papers for a more

detailed description. In a multifractal picture of turbulence (see for example [1]), the PDF

of the ﬁeld increments at a given scale can be interpreted as the superposition of many

PDFs, each one describing the statistics of the ﬁeld inside a well deﬁned (fractal) subset

of the ﬁeld. Then, the resulting PDF can be computed as the sum of such partial PDFs,

each one weighted by its relative occurrence in the ﬁeld. This view is supported by the

conditional analysis of the solar wind magnetic ﬁeld increments [14]. The model PDF can

be built up by introducing a parent distribution, describing the statistics inside each subsets,

and a distribution for the weights of the parent distributions. The parent distribution is the

large scale distribution of the ﬁeld increments, so that, as can be checked in Figure 1, we

choose a gaussian Gσ(δeτ ) (σ being the standard deviation). The scale-dependent weights

PDF is introduced as the distribution L(στ ) of the widths σ, so that the global PDF can

be obtained by computing the convolution of the parent distributions (of variable width σ)

with the distribution of their weights. The distribution L(στ ) could be in principle observed

directely from the data, by performing a conditioned analysis. Unfortunately, Helios 2

dataset is not large enough to allow for this kind of analysis, so that the shape of L(στ )

has to be deﬁned by some theoretical arguments. As in [13], we use a Log-normal function

fact for λ2 = 0 the Log-normal PDF is a δ-function, so that the convolution gives the
parent distribution (gaussian). As λ2 increases, the convolution includes more and more

diﬀerent values of σ, and with a more and more important weight, so that the tails of the

resulting PDF raise. Figure 3 presents the model PDFs ﬁtted to the data. As can be

seen the model reproduces in a satisfactory way the scaling evolution of the PDFs. The

obtained from the ﬁt with a power-law of λ2(τ ), in a given range of scales. This has been

already done for solar wind velocity and magnetic ﬁeld [15], and we report here these results

for comparison (see Table I). As for velocity and magnetic ﬁeld, the statistical features of

the induced electric ﬁeld are thus well described by the multifractal model. The scaling
properties of λ2 are evident and suggest the presence of an intermittent turbulent cascade of

the ideal invariants (energy, magnetic helicity, cross-elicity). From values of the parameter

reported in Table I, we can observe that the intermittency is more active than for the wind
velocity, as in the case of the magnetic ﬁeld. Higher values of λ2

max, in fact, indicate a higher

non-gaussianity of small scale PDFs, which in turn indicate a larger presence of intermittent

structures in the ﬂow. The values of the slope β are small, indicating a slow, not very

eﬃcient cascade mechanism. The fact that x

V0 component values of β are smaller than

k
for the y component is again related to the non-gaussian large scale statistics of the ﬁeld:
structures are already present at middle-range scales, and the range of variation of λ2(τ )

results smaller.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have analysed some statistical properties of the interplanetary induced electric ﬁeld,

as measured by Helios 2 spacecraft. The data we used are selected so that our samples

are homogeneous with respect to velocity and solar activity. The one-point statistics of

PDFs of the IEF components are gaussian, except for the radial component, which shows

exponential tails. This result may indicate that hypotheses on correlations, required for

the analytical results in [10], do not hold in the solar wind for the induced electric ﬁeld.

However, exponential PDFs are found found when considering the IEF associated with the

magnetic ﬁeld and velocity ﬂuctuations. This result is in agreement with Ref. [9]). We wish

to point out that, in the present work, we separate fast from slow wind, since the statistical

properties of slow and fast wind had been shown to be diﬀerent [4]. Moreover, the relatively

short-time range covered by the Helios 2 data (about one year) prevent from the mixing of

diﬀerent solar activity levels, wich could lead to lack of stationarity of turbulence.

The analysis of PDFs of the IEF increments at diﬀerent scales provides the characteriza-

tion of intermittency. We performed such analysis using a multifractal model PDF (Castaing

distribution) and ﬁtting the model to data, in order to obtain the characterizing parame-

ters. The scaling properties of such parameters are shown in Figures 4, that, together with

Figure 2, evidences and quantiﬁes the typical evolution of the statistics, from the large
scale parent (one-point) distribution, to the high-ﬂatness (high λ2), high-tailed small scales
statistics. A power-law behaviour is found for λ2 for two orders of magnitude, in the region

between 1 minute and 1–2 hours, that can be view as the inertial range of the turbulent

cascading quantities. This range coincides with previos results obtained from the analysis

of velocity and magnetic ﬁeld turbulence (see for example Ref. [8]), and conﬁrm one more

time the intermittent, turbulent nature of solar wind ﬂuctuations. The values of the param-
eters λ2

max and β, collected in Table I, can be interpreted in terms of the topology of the

most intermittent structures [13]. This could then be observed directely from the data, by

extracting such structures [16], and then comparing the results. More detailed study of the

nature of electric ﬁeld structures is left for future works.

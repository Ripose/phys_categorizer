ABSTRACT

We present the discovery of an object in the Pleiades open cluster, named

Teide 2, with optical and infrared photometry which place it on the cluster

sequence slightly below the expected substellar mass limit. We have obtained

low- and high-resolution spectra that allow us to determine its spectral type

(M6), radial velocity and rotational broadening; and to detect Hα in emission

and Li i 670.8 nm in absorption. All the observed properties strongly support

the membership of Teide 2 into the Pleiades. This object has an important role

in deﬁning the reappearance of lithium below the substellar limit in the Pleiades.

The age of the Pleiades very low-mass members based on their luminosities and

absence or presence of lithium is constrained to be in the range 100–120 Myr.

Introduction

The Pleiades open cluster has become a favorite location for brown dwarf (BD)

searches. This privilege is due to its proximity, young age, low extinction and compactness

(the same properties that make it easily recognized to the naked eye). Such advantages were

recognized over ten years ago, when the ﬁrst CCD surveys of the cluster began (Jameson &

Skillen 1989; Stauﬀer et al. 1989). Since then, there has been many eﬀorts to reach fainter

magnitudes and cover more area (see Hambly 1998 for a review), which have revealed many

BD candidates.

A breakthrough in our understanding of BDs has come from the successful application

of the lithium test (Rebolo, Mart´ın & Magazz`u 1992; Magazz`u, Mart´ın & Rebolo 1993),

which is an eﬃcient observational method for distinguishing young BDs from very low-mass

(VLM) stars. The ﬁrst object at the substellar limit with a Li detection was PPl 15 (Basri,

Marcy & Graham 1996; hereafter BMG) and soon after Li was detected in the BDs Teide 1

and Calar 3 (Rebolo et al. 1996). The detection of lithium in PPl 15 and the non-detection

in HHJ 3 (Marcy et al. 1994) was used by BMG to infer an age of ∼115 Myr for the Pleiades

cluster, which is substantially older than the canonical cluster age of 75 Myr inferred from

standard calculations of the upper main-sequence turnoﬀ. They argued that the turnoﬀ age

increases when core convective overshoot is included in the evolutionary calculations, an

eﬀect that could account for the diﬀerence between dating the cluster with high-mass stars

and with VLM objects.

PPl 15 was shown to lie on the binary infrared cluster sequence (Zapatero-Osorio,

Mart´ın & Rebolo 1997a), and recently it has been found to be a spectroscopic double-lined

BD binary (Basri & Mart´ın 1998). Thus, the luminosity used by BMG was overestimated

because they assumed that the object was single. This is relevant for the discussion of the

cluster age, because the luminosity and lithium of PPl 15 implied that it had to be younger

– 4 –

than 125 Myr. Since the luminosity of the primary in the PPl 15 binary is lower, the age

could be older. In this paper we present the discovery of a new object in the Pleiades,

which has a luminosity similar to the PPl 15 system. This object is located on the cluster

sequence for single objects, and thus its luminosity is not expected to be aﬀected by a close

companion. We have detected lithium in it, which conﬁrms its cluster membership, and

makes it an important object for deﬁning the lithium substellar boundary and constraining

the cluster age.

2. Observations

The object presented in this paper was discovered in a CCD survey of the Pleiades

carried out using the 0.82 m IAC80 telescope at the Observatorio del Teide in November

and December of 1995, and January 1996. We used a Thomson 10482 CCD with a ﬁeld of

view of 54.5 arcmin2 and R, I ﬁlters. Two exposure of 1800s were obtained for each ﬁlter.

We observed 13 diﬀerent ﬁelds, forming a mosaic of 590 arcmin2. The images were bias

subtracted, ﬂat ﬁelded, corrected for bad columns, and searched for pointlike sources using

DAOPHOT routines within IRAF1. The FWHM of the stars in our frames were in the

range 1”.5 to 2”.5. The instrumental magnitudes were calibrated with a secondary standard

ﬁeld within the Pleiades that we had observed in previous runs (Zapatero-Osorio, Rebolo &

Mart´ın 1997b). Due to variable seeing conditions, we did not reach the same sensitivity in

all the ﬁelds. We estimate that our completeness limits are in the range I=18.5–19.0 mag.

Near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the BD candidates found in the CCD

1IRAF is distributed by National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by

the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under contract with the

National Science Foundation.

– 5 –

survey were carried out on 1996 Nov 2 and 1997 Sep 21–23 at the Calar Alto 2.2 m

telescope with MAGIC, and the Lick 1 m telescope with LIRCII, respectively. The

standard J and K ′ ﬁlter set was used. Total exposure times ranged from 60 to 120 s in

each ﬁlter. We used the IRAF DAOPHOT package to reduce the frames and extract the

photometry. Instrumental aperture magnitudes were corrected for atmospheric extinction

and transformed into the CIT system using observations of the stars in the ﬁeld of the

BD Calar 3 as standards (Zapatero-Osorio et al. 1997a). Only one BD candidate had

optical and infrared photometry consistent with being a Pleiades member. We named it

Teide Pleiades 2 (from now on abreviated simply to Teide 2) because it resulted from the

extension of the Pleiades survey at the Teide Observatory. A preliminary report of this

discovery was made by Gallegos et al. (1998). The coordinates and R, I, J, K photometry

are listed in Table 1 and the ﬁnding chart is shown in Figure 1. Teide 2 is included in the

recent CFHT survey (Bouvier et al. 1998), where it has a magnitude of I=18.02±0.05

which is 0.2 mag brighter than ours. We have compared directly the CFHT and IAC80

CCD images and ﬁnd that Teide 2 has changed its brightness with respect to ﬁeld reference

stars. For the J-band, the magnitudes obtained in Calar Alto and Lick diﬀer by 0.12 mag,

which is somewhat larger than the expected error bars. Teide 2 is probably variable in I,

and perhaps also in J. This suggestion needs to be conﬁrmed with photometric monitoring,

which might measure the rotation period if the variability is due to photospheric spots.

Low-resolution spectroscopy of Teide 2 was obtained on 1996 Dec 8 and 9 using the ISIS

double-arm spectrograph at the WHT (we only used the red arm) with the grating R158R

and a TEK 10242 CCD detector; and the LRIS spectrograph with the 1200 line mm−1

grating and a TEK 20482 CCD detector at the Keck II telescope. The spectral resolution

(FWHM) and wavelength coverage provided by each instrumental setup were 5.8 ˚A and

650–915 nm , and 1.9 ˚A and 654–775 nm , respectively. Reduction and calibration

procedures were the same as described in Zapatero-Osorio et al. (1997c). High-resolution

– 6 –

spectroscopic observations were obtained on 1997 Dec 3 and 7, at the Keck I telescope

equipped with the HIRES echelle spectrometer. The instrumental conﬁguration and data

reduction have been discussed by Marcy et al. (1994) and BMG. The resolving power

obtained was R=31000. We took two spectra of Teide 2 with exposure times of 3600 s and

4000 s. However, the sky was cloudy when the ﬁrst spectrum was taken and we obtained a

factor of 2 less counts than in the second spectrum. We also obtained one 2700 s exposure

of PPl 1, a BD candidate discovered by Stauﬀer et al. (1989) which has a similar brightness

to Teide 2.

3. Results and discussion

A color-magnitude diagram displaying the position of Teide 2 and PPl 1 with respect to

other members of the Pleiades is presented in Figure 2 together with a theoretical 120 Myr

isochrone (dashed line), and the main-sequence of ﬁeld M-dwarfs (solid line) shifted to

the Pleiades distance (127 pc) and mean reddening (AV=0.12). Teide 2 falls close to the

theoretical isochrone, whereas PPl 15 clearly lies above it, suggesting that it could be a

binary (Zapatero-Osorio et al. 1997a). Basri & Mart´ın (1998) conﬁrmed that PPl 15 is

indeed a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a mass ratio close to unity, implying that

both components have nearly identical luminosities. Thus, we have indicated in Figure 2

that the I magnitude of each component in the PPl 15 system is ∼0.75 mag. fainter, while

the I − K color remains about the same. PPl 15 now falls right on the 120 Myr isochrone

for a mass of 0.06 M⊙, well below the substellar boundary. The location of Teide 2 in

Figure 2 indicates a mass of 0.072 M⊙ which is just below the expected substellar limit

(0.075 M⊙, cf. Baraﬀe et al. 1998). The position of PPl 1 above the isochrone might be

due to measurement errors, photometric variability, binarity or younger age. We cannot

presently distinguish between these possibilities.

– 7 –

Radial velocities for Teide 2 and PPl 1 were obtained by cross-correlating three HIRES

echelle orders covering the ranges 786.4–797.5 nm, 804.2–815.6 nm and 822.9–834.6 nm

with the M6V template Gl 406 (vrad=19.2±0.1 km s−1; X. Delfosse, private communication)

observed using the same instrumental conﬁguration. The radial velocities obtained are

given in Table 1. The error bars listed come from the dispersion among the diﬀerent echelle

orders, and correspond to about 0.4 pixels. No signiﬁcant radial velocity variation was

detected between the two spectra of Teide 2 taken on Dec 3 and Dec 7. Stauﬀer et al.

(1994) obtained a radial velocity for PPl 1 of 14.3±10 km s−1, which is consistent with our

measurement. The radial velocity of Teide 2 is consistent with known cluster members,

while that of PPl 1 is a little on the high side. The mean velocity of nearby ﬁeld dwarfs in

the line of sight toward the Pleiades is also similar to the cluster members (Stauﬀer et al.

1994), hence radial velocity alone is not very reliable as a membership criterion.

There are more spectroscopic indicators that allow us to further investigate the

membership of our objects in the Pleiades. One is the strength of Hα in emission, which is

typically greater than 3 ˚A in proper motion M4–M6 cluster members (Hodgkin, Jameson

& Steele 1995). For Teide 2 we measured Hα equivalent widths of 9.5±1.0, 8.5±1.0 and

4.7±0.4 ˚A in our ISIS, LRIS and HIRES spectra, respectively. For PPl 1 we measured

2.3±1.5˚A in our HIRES spectrum. Stauﬀer et al. (1994) and Mart´ın, Rebolo & Zapatero

Osorio (1996) published Hα measurement for PPl 1 of 4.8 ˚A and 6.5 ˚A, respectively. The

Hα emission of both Teide 2 and PPl 1 has variable strength, but on the average they are

comparable to those of late M-type proper motion Pleiades members. We measured the

rotational broadening of Teide 2 and PPl 1 in our HIRES spectra. We artiﬁcially broadened

Gl 406 (vsini<2.9 km s−1; Delfosse et al. 1998) with diﬀerent values of vsini until we found

the best match to the observed broadening of our Pleiades objects. The results are given

in Table 1. Field M4–M6 dwarfs usually have vsini<10 (Delfosse et al. 1998). Thus, the

vsini of Teide 2 and PPl 1 also indicate that they are young. A third clue to membership

– 8 –

comes from the general features seen in the low-resolution spectrum of Teide 2, which shows

prominent TiO and VO molecular absorption bands and strong atomic lines of K i (766.5

and 769.9 nm) and Na i (818.3 and 819.5 nm) characteristic of a cool dwarf. The spectral

type of Teide 2 is M6±0.5 according to the pseudocontinuum indices deﬁned by (Mart´ın

et al. 1996). Teide 2 nicely ﬁts the sequence of Pleiades members in the I-magnitude

versus spectral type diagram of Mart´ın et al. (1996). Summarizing, the radial velocities,

Hα emission, vsini, spectral type and photometric properties of Teide 2 and PPl 1 support

their Pleiades membership with a high level of conﬁdence.

In the top half of Figure 3 we compare the spectra of PPl 1, Teide 2 and PPl 15. The

spectrum of PPl 1 is noisier than those of the other two objects because it was taken with

the 2.5 m Isaac Newton telescope (Mart´ın et al. 1996). Teide 2 and PPl 1 have similar

spectral type within the error bars, and PPl 15 is somewhat cooler but not more than one

spectral subclass. Teide 2 conﬁrms that the dividing line between stars and BDs in the

Pleiades is at spectral type ∼M6 (Mart´ın et al. 1996). This result strengthens the recent

identiﬁcation of objects M6–M8 in several star-forming regions (Orion, Taurus, ρ Oph)

as likely brown dwarfs. Brice˜no et al. (1998) and Luhman et al. (1998) have shown that

the Na i lines of some BD candidates in Taurus are much weaker than those of dwarfs,

indicating that the very young BDs have low gravities. We note that the equivalent width

of the Na i (818.3 and 819.5 nm) measured in our WHT spectrum of Teide 2 is 6.0±0.3 ˚A.

This line is stronger than those of the Taurus BDs of similar spectral type as expected

because the Pleiades is much older, but slightly weaker than those of old M6 ﬁeld dwarfs.

In the bottom half of Figure 3 we compare the HIRES spectra of HHJ 3 and Teide 2.

Marcy et al. (1994) placed an upper limit to the Li i equivalent width of HHJ 3 of 0.19 ˚A.

Our spectrum of Teide 2 has lower S/N ratio than their spectrum of HHJ 3, because our

target is fainter and we had worse weather conditions. However, the Li i feature in Teide 2

– 9 –

is clearly much stronger than in HHJ 3 and we were able to detect it in our spectra. We

measured an equivalent width of 0.77±0.15 ˚A with respect to the local pseudocontinuum.

Our spectrum of PPl 1 has a factor of about 2 lower S/N ratio than that of Teide 2. We

degraded the resolution by performing a rebinning of 6 pixels and found a feature at the

position of the Li i line. However, we are not completely conﬁdent of a lithium detection

in PPl 1, and hence we place a conservative upper limit to its equivalent width. We have

compared the spectrum of Teide 2 with that of PPl 15 (BMG) and we conclude that their

Li i strengths are similar. The conversion from the observed lines to photospheric lithium

abundance needs the use of synthetic spectra. The main problem lies with our incomplete

knowledge of the transitions of the TiO molecule, which is the main absorber in this

spectral region. New calculations by Pavlenko (1997) suggest that the lithium abundances

of Teide 2 and PPl 15 could be close to the interstellar value, implying that these objects

have suﬀered little depletion. The estimate made by BMG that PPl 15 had preserved ∼1%

of its initial lithium is a conservative lower limit. Furthermore, their measure of the Li i

equivalent width is compromised by its binary nature.

The VLM members of the Pleiades (≤0.1 M⊙) are non-degenerate, fully convective

objects that derive most of their luminosity from gravitational contraction. Hence, their

evolution is relatively simple and can even be computed analytically (Bildsten et al. 1997).

The faintest Pleiades member for which lithium is undetected gives a lower limit to the

age. This is currently HHJ 3, and BMG obtained an age older than about 110 Myrs for it.

We have checked with new theoretical models (Baraﬀe et al. 1998; Bildsten et al. 1997;

Burrows 1997 (private communication); D’Antona & Mazzitelli 1998) that the lower age

limit set by HHJ 3 is in the range 100–120 Myr taking into account the observational error

bars. This result is not sensitive to the choice of theoretical models. On the other hand, the

brightest BDs for which lithium is detected provide an upper limit to the cluster age. We

have converted the I, K photometry and spectral type of Teide 2 to bolometric luminosity

– 10 –

by employing relationships derived for cool ﬁeld dwarfs (Tinney et al. 1993). Since Teide 2

shows lithium, its luminosity implies that it has to be younger than 120 Myr according to

all the available models. We have also compared directly the absolute I, J, Kmagnitudes of

Teide 2 with the predictions of Baraﬀe et al. (1998) and ﬁnd similar results. Teide 2 and

HHJ 3 can only be coeval if both of them have ages in the narrow range 100–120 Myr. With

only a few objects around the cluster substellar limit we cannot rule out the possibility of

an age spread, but their location close to the 120 Myr isochrone in Figure 2 indicates that

they are essentially coeval. All the recent models also agree that the mass of Teide 2 is

just below the substellar limit. Taking into account the observational error bars and the

diﬀerent models, we estimate a mass of 0.070±0.005 M⊙. Teide 2 is most likely a single

BD, or if it is a binary the secondary does not contribute much to the optical-NIR ﬂuxes.

Hence, Teide 2 can be considered a benchmark object deﬁning the borderline between BDs

and stars in the Pleiades.

SOLAR WIND ACCELERATION BY THE DISSIPATION OF
ALFV´EN WAVES

Abstract. Axford and McKenzie [1992] suggested that the energy released
in impulsive reconnection events generates high frequency Alfv´en waves.
The kinetic equation for spectral energy density of waves is derived in
the random phase approximation. Solving this equation we ﬁnd the wave
spectrum with the power law “-1” in the low frequency range which is
matched to the spectrum above the spectral brake with the power low “-
1.6.” The heating rate of solar wind protons due to the dissipation of Alfv´en
waves is obtained.

1. Introduction

≈

≈

The solar wind which is formed by the gas-dynamic expansion of solar
corona into the interplanetary space can be divided into two states: the fast
(> 700 km/s) and slow (
400 km/s) streams. The fast solar wind originates
in the polar coronal holes, regions of the solar corona with relatively low
106 K, reduced plasma density n = 108 cm−3
electron temperature T
10 G [1], [2]. Variations of the
and magnetic ﬁeld at the base of corona B0 ≈
velocity of this fast solar wind streams are insigniﬁcant (700–800 km/s). The
slow solar wind is associated with transient openings of closed ﬁeld regions
13◦
in the corona. The streams of slow wind are limited by the range
near the equator. The transition zone between this regions has the width
20◦ on the north and south latitudes in the solar minimum [3].
±
The radiation balance analysis in the near equatorial coronal holes [4] shows
that to accelerate solar wind it is necessary to dissipate the energy ﬂux of
105 erg/cm2
s within the distance of one-

temperature 1, 5

Axford and McKenzie [1] suggested that the energy source, necessary
to accelerate fast solar wind, is in the regions of strong magnetic ﬁeld
that deﬁne the boundaries of chromospheric supergranules. If the magnetic
ﬁeld is not strictly unipolar in this regions, for example, the closed loops of
magnetic ﬁeld lines are existing at the base of the corona, then the necessary
energy is released in the processes of impulsive reconnection of magnetic
ﬁeld lines on the characteristic spatial scale of network activity l = 100 km.
Such processes of impulsive reconnection are accompanied by the generation
of Alfv´en and fast magnetosonic waves. Using the parameters of plasma at
the coronal base described above we can ﬁnd the Alfv´en wave velocity VA =
107 cm/s,
B/√4πnmi = 2
and the characteristic time of magnetic ﬁeld lines reconnection [5]:

that the characteristic period of Alfv´en waves is of the order of obtained
reconnection time. The total energy ﬂux necessary to accelerate fast solar

wind is estimated as 8

should be dissipated within one-two solar radii above the solar surface.

As the dominant mechanism of dissipation of Alfv´en waves generated
by the processes of impulsive reconnection of magnetic ﬁeld lines, we will
consider the induced scattering of Alfv´en waves by plasma ions [6]. For
the sake of simplicity as in the paper [6] we will limit ourselves by the
case of the circularly polarized Alfv´en waves propagating along the radial
magnetic ﬁeld B0 = B0(r)z from the polar coronal holes with the wave
vector k = (0, 0, k), where r is the radial distance from the center of the
Sun. With the help of the above cited parameters of plasma and magnetic
ﬁeld at the base of the corona, we ﬁx the following ordering of the ion
cyclotron ωci, Alfv´en ωk and ion Doppler kvT i frequencies:

ωci ≫

ωk ≫
where ωci = eB0(r)/mic, ωk = kVA. Under this conditions plasma is magne-
tized and the resonant condition describing the interaction of Alfv´en waves
with the diﬀerent polarization propagating in the opposite directions along
the magnetic ﬁeld lines can be written as:

k′VA < 0, k, k′ > 0 and vz is the velocity along
where ωk = kVA > 0, ωk′ =
the magnetic ﬁeld. Here in the process of induced scattering the quantum
of higher frequency is exchanged for that of lower frequency. As a result of
this some fraction of wave energy is transferred to plasma ions.

ourselves by the case Ti ≫
Then in the section 3 we will describe the evolution of the Alfv´en waves
spectrum in the processes of their propagation and show that the wave en-
ergy ﬂux necessary to accelerate the fast solar wind can be dissipated at
the heights of 1-2 solar radii above the solar surface that is required by the
Withbroe [4] analysis.

Following perturbation theory we solve the kinetic equation (4) by ﬁnd-
ing the distribution function of plasma particles as power series in the wave
amplitudes:

fj = fj0 + fj1 + fj2 + fj3,

where fj0 is the isotropic maxwellian distribution of particles of j species
in the zero approximation and fjn is the particle distribution function on
the n-th step of iteration. Using the iteration procedure for solving the
kinetic equation (4) we obtain the corresponding Fourier’s components of
the particle distribution functions for the ﬁrst two steps of iteration:

where T⊥ is the perpendicular proton temperature in Kelvin, kB Boltz-
mann’s constant, n(r) = 108(R⊙/r)2 cm−3 density of plasma.

We integrate the equation (34) from the three solar radii assuming that

the acceleration of solar wind is already achieved. As a result we have:

Non-adiabatic heating of the protons related to the presence of the
volumetric energy ﬂux Π(r) reach only 0.16 K/nT in the range of radial
distances [3R⊙, 200R⊙]. Therefore the source of energy for the acceleration
of fast solar wind from the polar coronal holes must now be found in the
solar corona itself [18].

Below the spectral brake frequency fbr(r) we have the spectrum of
Livshits-Tsytovich [7], [8] with the spectral index α =
1. However this
spectrum doesn’t extend from fbr to the whole low frequency domain but
truncated by the WKB solution.

4. Conclusion

Using the collisionless kinetic equation for interacting Alfv´en waves in the
random phase approximation we have followed analytically the evolution of
these waves in the process of their propagation from the polar solar corona.
As a result of such evolution the boundary of waves with the spectral index
1 is shifted towards low frequencies due to induced scattering of
α =
waves by ions, which increase energy of ions by the recoil eﬀect. However,
this spectrum does not extend over the whole low frequency range but is
truncated by WKB solution.

Above the frequency fbr the spectrum with the spectral index α =
is obtained. Let us note that both in the polar solar corona and in the
interplanetary space the approximation of collisionless plasma is valid at
least up to the distance 0.87 AU.

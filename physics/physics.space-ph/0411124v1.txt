Abstract

An accuracy of the last version of International Reference Ionosphere IRI-2001 at
low latitudes is tested by a detailed comparison of longitudinal variations in the
equatorial anomaly development following from this model with the ones given by
independent ISS-b satellite data. A few drawbacks of IRI-2001 were revealed, partic-
ularly, (1) its longitudinal variations are substantially oversmoothed in comparison
with the satellite ones, and (2) there are speciﬁc “gaps” in the degree of develop-
ment of the anomaly in the longitudinal zone about 60o, which seem to be caused
by noisy oscillations in the model description of the critical frequency.

1 Introduction

As is known, a worldwide distribution of the electron concentration in the
F2-layer maximum (commonly characterized by the critical frequency f0F2)
is one of cornerstones of IRI, because it serves as basis for constructing height
proﬁles of all other ionospheric parameters (e.g., Rawer, 1984a,b; Rawer, et al.,
1978). So, the accuracy of presentation of f0F2 is an important criterion of
overall consistency of this model.

In general, the works on the worldwide mapping of f0F2 began long before
the establishment of IRI (see, for example, review by Bradley, 1990). The
main problem here is a strongly-nonuniform distribution of the available data
of ionospheric sounding over the Earth’s regions (namely, their insuﬃcient
amount in the southern hemisphere and absence in the extensive oceanic ar-
eas). This leads to the serious obstacles in the numerical interpolation proce-
dures. They are got around by introduction of a set of the so-called “screen”
points, in which f0F2 are taken as average values derived from the available
data at the same latitudes. 2 As a result, the interpolation procedure becomes
well-posed, but longitudinal behavior of the critical frequency turns out to be
inevitably distorted. This problem was discussed in many previous IRI meet-
ings (e.g., Bilitza, 1995; Bilitza et al., 1987, 1993; Ramanamurty, 1984; Rawer,
1984c, 1994); and much eﬀorts have been undertaken in the last two decades
to improve the maps of f0F2 incorporated into IRI.

The aim of the present report is to review a current situation for the particular
case of the low-latitude ionospheric F2-layer. As is known, its most important
morphological feature is the equatorial, or Appleton (1946), anomaly. So, the
degree of development of this anomaly (as function of time and longitude) can
be a good indicator of accuracy in the corresponding latitudinal range.

2 Indices Characterizing the Equatorial Anomaly Development

First of all, we should answer the question what is the most appropriate pa-
rameter to describe the degree of development of the Appleton anomaly?

In principle, any eﬀective index introduced for this purpose is arbitrary. So,
strictly speaking, none of them can be called “correct” or “incorrect”. Never-
theless, it is reasonable to impose some natural physical requirements on its
behavior. First of all, such index should increase smoothly from zero when the
anomaly begins to develop (and decrease smoothly to zero when the anomaly
disappears). Secondly, it should characterize the amplitudes of both peaks of
the anomaly.

From this point of view, a diﬀerence between the maximum crest (marked
by +) and trough (−) of the anomaly, f0F2+
, which was often
used in the previous studies 3 , is not an optimal choice. This parameter works
well only when the anomaly develops (or decays) symmetrically; otherwise it

2 In fact, an eﬀective latitude, corrected for the magnetic inclination, is commonly
used in such calculations. More details can be found in Rawer (1984a) or, for a
similar model developed in Russia, in Chernyshev and Vasil’eva (1973).
3 For example, in the work by Deminova (1995) it was denoted by n.

jumps (or drops) instantly by a considerable value when the second (minor)
crest smoothly appears (or disappears), as illustrated in the right-hand panel
of Fig. 1.

A more reasonable parameter, proposed in our recent work (Dumin, 2002), is
deﬁned as

where superscripts + and − refer to the anomaly crest and trough, respec-
tively, and subscripts N and S designate the north and south. (It is assumed
here that P = 0 if the anomaly trough is absent.)

The main advantage of P is that it behaves smoothly both in symmetric and
asymmetric case. In addition, when structure of the anomaly is approximately
symmetric, P is reduced just to the diﬀerence between the amplitudes of each
of its crests and the trough.

3 The Maps of the Equatorial Anomaly Development

A convenient form of presentation of the equatorial anomaly development in
space and time was proposed by Hopkins (1972), who drawn the maps of the
degree of development by Ariel-3 satellite data as function of longitude and
local time (LT).

A similar approach was applied in our work (Dumin, 2002) based on the data
by ISS-b satellite; but the exactly-speciﬁed parameter P was utilized instead
of the qualitative estimates by Hopkins (1972), and universal time (UT) was
used instead of the local time because of the speciﬁc form of the original
data presentation by ISS-b team (Atlas, 1983). The main conclusion of this
work was that the tempo–longitudinal patterns of the anomaly derived from
the above-mentioned sets of data, in general, coincide with each other very

3

well. This is a quite nontrivial fact, since these data were obtained in two
absolutely diﬀerent time periods by diﬀerent instrumental methods (the top-
side sounding by ISS-b and in situ probing by Ariel-3) and, thereby, refer to
somewhat diﬀerent altitudes.

Therefore, the above-mentioned form of description of longitudinal structure
of the equatorial anomaly can serve as a convenient method for testing various
ionospheric models in the low-latitude F2-layer, while the ISS-b measurements
(which are one of the most numerous and systematized satellite data set avail-
able by now) can be used as a reliable primary standard.

So, to test the last version of International Reference Ionosphere IRI-2001
(Bilitza, 2004), we drew the isolines of P in the longitude–UT coordinates,
as is shown in Fig. 2. Since the critical frequency of F2-layer can be ob-
tained in IRI-2001 by one of the alternative models—purely empirical CCIR
or semi-empirical URSI,—both of them were used for calculations, and the
corresponding results are presented in the top and bottom left-hand panels,
respectively. For the sake of comparison, the same isolines derived from the
ISS-b satellite data are presented in the top right-hand panel.

The inclined dashed lines in Fig. 2 represent the trajectories of the subsolar
point (i.e. the local noon). Each panel comprises the isocontours of P for
four equinox periods listed in Table 1. 4 These 4-months periods are just
the time intervals required for collecting a complete set of the worldwide
data by ISS-b satellite; and they are exactly the same as used in the orig-
inal analysis by ISS-b team (for more details, see Atlas, 1983; Matuura, et al.,
1981; Wakai and Matuura, 1980). The corresponding isocontours for URSI and
CCIR models were calculated for a single date in the center of each interval.
For a better visualization of longitudinal variations, the range of longitudes in
each map was taken to be 1.5 times greater than 360o.

4 The equinox periods are used everywhere in our analysis because the satellite
data available for them are the most numerous.

4 Discussion

The following main conclusions can be derived from the analysis of the maps
presented in Fig. 2:

(1) The data by ISS-b satellite demonstrate a much more ﬁne structure in
the degree of development of Appleton anomaly than both URSI and CCIR
models, incorporated into IRI. (In other words, the “islands” of P in ISS-b
maps are much more numerous, smaller in size, and greater in amplitude.)
It is important to emphasize that this ﬁne structure is in no way related
to the mathematical method of interpolation of the experimental data, be-
cause the number of zonal harmonics taken into account in CCIR and URSI
maps is even greater than in ISS-b maps. Besides, the same kind of the
ﬁne structure was revealed in the independent satellite data, e.g. by Ariel-3
(Hopkins, 1972) and Interkosmos-19 (Deminova, 1995; Depuev and Pulinets,
2000; Dumin and Sitnov, 1994; Karpachev, 1988).

(2) In general, CCIR maps reveal more ﬁne details than URSI maps. Unfor-
tunately, these details do not coincide with the ones in ISS-b satellite maps.
So, as was already mentioned in the Introduction, the longitudinal distortions
caused by the “screen” points are really substantial. Moreover, the situation
is especially bad at the low latitudes because it cannot be corrected by a theo-
retical account of the thermospheric wind inﬂuence on the ionospheric plasma,
since the low-latitude F2-layer is strongly aﬀected also by the E×B drift orig-
inating in E-layer (as was already mentioned, for example, by Bilitza et al.,
1987).

(3) There are very strange “gaps” in the degree of the anomaly development in
the longitudinal zone about 60o both in CCIR and URSI maps. They are espe-
cially surprising since this zone is suﬃciently well covered by the ionospheric
sounding stations. To avoid misunderstanding, it should be emphasized that
these “gaps” are just in the degree of development of the anomaly P but not in
the critical frequency f0F2 (or in the respective electron concentration) itself.
As follows from a more careful analysis, the problem is that the latitudinal
proﬁles of f0F2 in this longitudinal zone possess more than two local maxima
at low latitudes. 5 Such stable excessive maxima, in general, are not revealed
by the immediate analysis of ground-based sounding data. So, they are most
probably caused by some drawbacks of the interpolation procedure, resulting
in the noisy oscillations.

Therefore, as follows from the above consideration, the accuracy of description

5 Our algorithm of computation of P was constructed so that the degree of de-
velopment of the anomaly is associated just with a “classical” two-peak latitudinal
proﬁle of f0F2, otherwise the anomaly is assumed to be not developed.

of longitudinal variations in the equatorial (Appleton) anomaly by IRI-2001
remains insuﬃcient; so that further improvements should be done.

(Received 22 June 2005)

In this paper we develop the new approach in time series analysis with a variable time step and present
the results of quantitative and qualitative estimation of randomness and regularity, and the study of non-
Markovian eﬀects of the X-ray emission intensity of the microquasar GRS 1915+105. Our estimation is
based on the application of the theory of discrete non-Markovian stochastic processes and gives a wide
set of quantitative characteristics and parameters of the studied system with a variable time step. This
set reﬂects the change of the eﬀects of randomness and regularity, the alternation of Markovian and non-
Markovian processes in the initial time signals. Initially these characteristics were determined for the simple
model systems constructed by means of a molecular dynamics method. Further the calculation of these
parameters was executed for the X-ray emission intensity of the microquasar GRS 1915+105. We have
developed a theoretical scheme for the detailed analysis of the time series with a variable time step. The
new theory allows us to extract more detailed information about the X-ray emission of the microquasar GRS
1915+105 from the experimental time series. The received set of the parameters allows to estimate accurately
randomness and stochastic behavior, regularity and robustness, non-Markovian eﬀects of statistical memory
in the intensity of the X-ray emission. The analysis of the experimental data with a constant and variable
time step is carried out by means of phase portraits, power spectra of the initial time and event correlation
function (TCF and ECF), and memory functions (MF) of the junior order, the ﬁrst three points of non-
Markovity parameter.

Key words: discrete non-Markov processes, time series analysis, randomness and non-Markovity, X-ray
intensity of GRS 1915+105

Introduction

The problems of randomness and stochastic behav-
ior, regularity and robustness have been in the focus
of attention in the studies of real complex systems
of various nature over the past years. The analysis
of individual properties and characteristics of real
complex systems is impossible without registration
and quantitative estimation of various information
on manifestation of chaosity and randomness. By
the change of the measure of randomness or regular-
ity it is possible to judge about the complex dynam-
ics of the system and its evolution. The discovery

of the phenomenon of chaos in dynamic systems has
allowed to take a new look at functioning of complex
systems. Chaos is absence of order and it charac-
terizes randomness and unpredictability of changes
in the behavior of a system and impossibility to de-
termine their origin and reasons.

While studying multiform manifestations of ran-
domness, the authors have deﬁned chaos, and its the
parameters describing chaotic and regular stochas-
tic processes in diﬀerent ways. As a rule, the search
for the most accurate criteria for the estimation of
randomness or regularities in the dynamics of real

objects is carried out if we have the information on
the behavior of the well-known models of nonlinear
dynamics such as, for example, Lorentz model, Pois-
son model etc. Initially for the similar systems one
calculates the parameters determining their chaotic
dynamics. Further the given parameters are cal-
culates for real physical objects. On the basis of
the comparative analysis of these characteristics it
is possible to come to certain conclusions about the
evolution and further dynamics of the studied sys-
tem. However the above mentioned models of non-
linear dynamics do not carry suﬃcient information
about the internal properties of real objects. The
models similar to real physical objects allow to avoid
these defects. The model description of a gas, liq-
uid and solid by the methods of molecular dynamics
simulations can serve as an example.

In addition for the estimation of optimal qualita-
tive and quantitative parameters and characteristics
of non-Markovian eﬀects and eﬀects of randomness
and regularity of X-ray emission intensity dynam-
ics of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 we use the
method of molecular dynamics. The galactic micro-
quasar GRS 1915+105 was discovered as an X-ray
transient in 1992 [1], and has been observed to be
extremely luminous ever since. This binary system
contains a 14 M⊙ black hole [2] accreting from a
late-type giant of mass 0.8 ± 0.5 M⊙ [3] via Roche
lobe overﬂow. GRS 1915+105 is unique among ac-
creting Galactic black holes spending much of its
time at super-Eddington luminosities [4]. It is an
extremely variable source, exhibiting dramatic, ape-
riodic variability on a wide range of timescales, from
milliseconds to months [5]. GRS 1915+105 is lo-
cated on the Galactic plane at a distance of ∼ 11−12
kpc [2, 6] and suﬀers a large extinction of 25-30 mag
in the visual band. The basic characteristics of the
GRS 1915+105 binary system is the systemic veloc-
ity which is γ = −3 ± 10 km/s, the orbital period
of the system is Torb = 33.5 ± 1.5 days [7]. Spec-
troscopic observations in the near-infrared H and
K bands identiﬁed absorption features from the at-
mosphere of the companion (mass-donating star) in
the GRS 1915+105 binary. The detection of 12CO
and 13CO band heads plus a few metallic absorp-
tion lines suggested a K − M spectral type and lu-

minosity class III (giant) [2]. Hard X-ray studies in
20− 100keV band have shown erratic intensity vari-
ations on time scales of days and months [8]-[10]. In
Ref. [11] the technique of diﬀerentiating and rescal-
ing was applied to the GRS 1915+105 X-ray data.
As a result the existence of a fundamental time-scale
for the system in the range of 12-17 days was found.
[12] it was concluded, that microquasar
In Ref.
GRS1915+105, as any other black hole system, may
be chaotic in nature. One of proofs of the similar
behavior of black hole systems is chaotic variabil-
ity of the X-ray emission [13]. For the estimation
of a degree of randomness or regularity of the X-ray
emission of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 the cor-
relation dimension of the system [12] is often used.
In this work we present a new method of re-
search of randomness, regularity, robustness and
non-Markovian eﬀects in the X-ray emission inten-
sity of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 on the ba-
sis of the theory of discrete non-Markovian stochas-
tic processes [14]-[16]. The eﬀects of non-Markovity
in real complex systems, natural [14, 15], live [14],
[16]-[19], biological [20]-[22] and physical [21, 23]
are of special interest for the correlation analysis.
This method allows to deﬁne the set of character-
istics and parameters, which contain detailed infor-
mation about non-Markovian eﬀects and degrees of
randomness of the X-ray emission of the researched
system. Initially we have calculated the given char-
acteristics and parameters for model systems by the
method of molecular dynamics:
for a low density
gas with greater randomness and the stochastic be-
havior in particle motion; for a high density gas;
for a liquid near the triple point; for a solid that
corresponds to a greater regularity in movement of
particles. On the basis of the received results we
have executed qualitative and quantitative estima-
tion of non-Markovian eﬀects and of stochastic and
regular regimes in the initial signal with a constant
and variable time step for the X-ray emission inten-
sity of the microquasar GRS 1915+105.

2 The theoretical

framework of
the statistical theory of discrete
non-Markovian stochastic pro-
cesses

In this section we present the basic concepts and
deﬁnitions of the theory of discrete non-Markovian
stochastic processes [14]-[16], used here for the anal-
ysis of a time series with a constant and variable
time step. The theory is constructed on the discrete
ﬁnite-diﬀerence presentation of the Zwanzig-Mori
kinetic equations [24, 25] well-known in statistical
physics. The theory of the discrete non-Markovian
stochastic processes is widely applied to the analysis
of real systems of physical, biological, live and social
nature [14]-[19],[23]. The dynamic, kinetic and re-
laxation parameters and characteristics of this the-
ory, contain detailed information about individual
properties and qualities of the studied complex sys-
tem.

2.1 The basic concepts and deﬁnitions
of the statistical theory of discrete
non-Markovian stochastic processes
for the analysis of time series with a
constant time step

As a rule, the time registration of any characteris-
tics or parameters of a complex system is carried
out at discrete time intervals of equal length. It al-
lows to show the essential features of ﬂuctuations
and irregularities and also the features of various
dynamic regimes in the initial time series. Some
key deﬁnitions and concepts of the statistical the-
ory of discrete non-Markovian stochastic processes
for the analysis of the time series with a constant
time step [14]-[16] are given below.

Let us present the time dynamics of the X-
ray emission intensity of the microquasar GRS
1915+105 as a discrete time series xj of some vari-
able X:

X = {x(T ), x(T + τ ), x(T + 2τ ), . . . ,

(1)

x(T + kτ ), . . . , x(T + (N − 1)τ )}.

Here T is the initial moment of the time the reg-

istration of the X-ray emission intensity, (N − 1)τ
is the total time of registration of the signal, τ is
a discretization time step. In the researched time
series the discretization time ∆t = τ = 1 day. The
mean value of the variable hXi, ﬂuctuation δxj , and
dispersion σ2 can be presented as follows:

hXi =

x(T + jτ ),

N

δxj = xj − hXi, σ2 =

For the description of the dynamic properties of
the studied complex system (the dynamics of corre-
lations) it is convenient to use the normalized time
correlation function (TCF):

a(t) =

1
(N − m)σ2

N −1−m

j=0
X

×δx(T + (j + m)τ ),

δx(T + jτ )

(3)

where t = mτ . Here δxj, δxj+m are ﬂuctuations of
the variable X at j, j + m step, correspondingly, σ2
is an absolute dispersion of the variable X. TCF in
Eq. (3) satisﬁes the requirements of normalization
and attenuation of correlations:

a(t) = 1,

lim
t→0

lim
t→∞

a(t) = 0.

(4)

It is necessary to note, that for a certain class of
complex systems the requirement of correlations at-
tenuation is not always possible.

By the use of the Zwanzig-Mori projection oper-
ators technique [24, 25] it is possible to receive an
interconnected chain of ﬁnite-diﬀerence equations of
a non-Markovian type [14]-[16] for the initial TCF

a(t) and the memory function Mi(t) (i = 1, 2, ..., n):

Then the spectrum of the non-Markovity parameter
is deﬁned as a set of dimensionless quantities [26]:

(7)

Orthogonal dynamic variables Wn are received with
the help of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure:

hWnWmi = δn,mh|Wn|2i,
where δn,m is Kronecker’s symbol. To compare the
relaxation time scales for the initial TCF a(t) and
the ith order memory functions Mi(t) we use the
non-Markovity statistical parameter ε. Initially the
given parameter was used for the analysis of the irre-
versible phenomena in a condensed matter [26]-[29].
According to [14]-[16] we introduce the relaxation
times of the initial TCF and the nth order memory
functions:

τa = △t

τM1 = △t

{εi} = {ε1, ε2, ..., εn−1},
ε1 = τa/τM1, ε2 = τM1/τM2, . . . ,
εn = τMn−1/τMn.

(9)

Thus, the value εn characterizes the comparison of
relaxation times of the memory functions Mn−1 and
Mn. The non-Markovity parameter allows to divide
all relaxation processes into Markov, quasi-Markov
and non-Markov processes. The spectrum of the
non-Markovity parameter deﬁnes the stochastic pe-
culiarities of TCF.

In work [14] the concept of the non-Markovity
generalized parameter for frequency - dependent
case was introduced:

µi(ν) = |△t

The above-mentioned equations (3)-(5) present
the case of Zwanzig-Mori’s statistical theory [24,
25]
for the discrete statistical complex systems.
The statistical theory of discrete non-Markovian
stochastic processes allows to reveal Markov and
non-Markov eﬀects, the eﬀects of statistical mem-
ory, eﬀects of a dynamic alternation of stochastic
and regular regimes in the initial time series for the
X-ray emission intensity of the microquasar GRS
1915+105.

2.2 A new approach to the analysis of
discrete time series with a variable
time step

(8)

In many real complex systems the registration of
the initial time signal by diﬀerent reasons is carried

out at time intervals of diﬀerent length. To such
systems we can refer the objects of an astrophysical
and seismological nature, some biological and social
systems, economic and ecological objects [30, 31,
32].

In the given work we oﬀer a new approach to
the description of discrete non-Markovian stochas-
tic processes with a time step of variable length.
Such presentation of the initial time signal allows to
ﬁnd the dynamic development of the system, con-
nected with a not real time scale but with its con-
sistent presentation. The basic idea of this method
consists in ﬁxing individual events as a sequence of
dynamic values. It allows to consider the dynam-
ics of the system as a sequence of individual events.
As an example, here we present the analysis of the
time registration with a variable time step of the
X-ray emission intensity of the microquasar GRS
1915+105.

2.2.1 The basic concepts and deﬁnitions
the theory of discrete non-Markovian
of
stochastic processes with a variable time step

Let us consider the chaotic dynamics of the X-ray
emission intensity as a sequence of events which are
“non-uniform” on a time scale:

where the intervals of time ∆tij = ti − tj, j = i +
1, j = i − 1, are unequal. Here ξi presents the event
at the moment ti which follows after the event ξi−1,
i = 1, ..., N is the number of the event.

The mean value hEi, ﬂuctuation δξi, absolute dis-
persion σ2 for the set of the random variable E are
deﬁned as follows:

hEi =

ξi, δξi = ξi − hEi,

(12)

According to [30]-[32] we shall deﬁne the correlation
dependence in a sequence of events (11) as follows:

a(n) =

1
(N − m)σ2

N −m

i=1
X

δξiδξi+m.

(13)

The function introduced in the similar way a(t)
presents the event (not time!) correlation function
(ECF). The general requirements suggest, that ECF
should have the properties of normalization and at-
tenuation of correlations:

lim
n→1

a(n) = 1,

lim
n→∞

a(n) = 0.

(14)

For the description of a discrete sequence of events
we shall use Liouville’s ﬁnite-diﬀerence equation of
movement:

∆ξi(n)
∆n

= i

L(n, 1)ξi(n),

(15)

where ξi(n + 1) = U (n + 1, n)ξi(n), U (n + 1, n) is
b
an evolution operator.

Thus, the left hand side of the Eq. (15) can be

submitted as follows:

∆ξi
∆n

= U (n + 1, n)ξi(n) − ξi(n) =

{U (n + 1, n) − 1}ξi(n).

(16)

Let us present the set of values of the dynamic vari-
able δξi as a k-component vector of the system’s
state:
a) the vector of the initial state:

A1

k = {δξ1, δξ2, δξ3, ..., δξk},

(17a)

Am

m+k = {δξm, δξm+1, δξm+2, ..., δξm+k},

(17b)

where 1 ≤ k ≤ N .

Using the standard expression for the scalar prod-
uct of vectors and relations (13), (17a) and (17b),
we receive the “event” correlation function (ECF)
for a stationary sequence of events (11) in the fol-
lowing way:

a(n) =

k+m(n)i

k(1)Am

(18)

2.2.2 Kinetic equations for discrete non-
Markov processes with variable time step

By the use of the projection operator technique we
can split Euclidean vector’s space of state A(k) into
two mutually-orthogonal subspaces:

Here λ1 is an eigenvalue Liouville’s quasiopera-
tor. Relaxation parameter Λ1 and memory function
M1(j) are deﬁned as follows:

3 The experimental data and the
details of computer simulations

We analyze here two types of the experimental data
of the X-ray emission intensity of the microquasar
GRS 1915+105 [34]. The ﬁrst set of the data
presents a one-day averaged time series of the X-
ray emission intensity in the period from February,
1, 1996 to September, 1, 2004 (a step discretization
τ = 1 day). For the analysis of the given time series
we use the statistical theory of discrete non-Markov
processes with a constant time step (see Sect. 2.1).
For the analysis of the non-equidistant time se-
ries (the 2nd type of data) we use the statistical the-
ory of discrete non-Markovian stochastic processes
with a variable time step (see Sect. 2.2). As ex-
perimental data [34] we use the time series of the
X-ray emission intensity of the microquasar GRS
1915+105 with a variable time step for the period
from February, 1, 1996 to September, 1, 2004. To
study the stochastic properties of the X-ray emis-
sion we have carried out an additional study of four

model systems using the method of molecular dy-
namics. We have studied a model system (a gas, a
liquid, and a solid) consisting of 2048 particles of ar-
gon molecules. The particles interacted by Lennard-
Jones potential V (r) = 4ε{(σ/r)12 − (σ/r)6} with
parameters ε/kB = 120K and σ = 3.405˚A [35].
Here ε is a well depth, σ is a interatomic distance.
The simulation was carried out at constant temper-
ature T ∗ = 0.6 and at various densities n∗ = 0.1,
n∗ = 0.5, n∗ = 1.0 and n∗ = 1.5. We made use
of the “velocity Verlet” algorithm to integrate the
equations of motion [36] with a time step 10−14 sec.

4 Randomness,

regularity and
non-Markov eﬀects applied to
the dynamic analysis of simple
model systems and the X-ray
emission intensity of the micro-
quasar GRS 1915+105

In this section we present a new method of quantita-
tive estimation of randomness, regularity and non-
Markov eﬀects of a time series. Preliminary the
calculation of the degree of manifestation of non-
Markov eﬀects and randomness or regularities in
the dynamic movement of a particle in the given
cell will be carried out on simple model systems:
a low density gas, a dense gas, a liquid near triple
point, a solid. The level of randomness and non-
Markov eﬀects is established for each model system
and is carried out by means of a set of various char-
acteristics. The set of data of characteristics and
quantitative parameters contains reliable informa-
tion about the degree of randomness or regularity
and non-Markov eﬀects in the researched model sys-
tem. Then on the basis of the calculation of these
characteristics we shall proceed to the analysis of a
real process: the event variability of the X-ray emis-
sion intensity of the microquasar GRS 1915+105.

4.1 Randomness and non-Markov eﬀects

1.5

in simple model systems

The study of the dynamic features of behavior of
real complex systems of a diﬀerent nature in car-
diology, neurophysiology, epidemiology, biophysics,
seismology shows the existence of close connection
between the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity param-
eter and a quantitative measure of randomness or
regularity of the measured signal. To establish this
connection we present the results of the study of
several simple physical models. The purpose of the
similar study consists in detecting typical features of
behavior of the non-Markovity parameter for model
systems with a diﬀerent degree of randomness or
regularity. The given models were constructed by
the method of molecular dynamics. As an exam-
ple we have considered four Lennard-Jones model
systems: a low density gas (T ∗ = 0.6, n∗ = 0.1 in
reduced units with parameters, where σ = 3.405˚A
is an interatomic distance, ε/kB = 120K is the
well depth; T = T ∗ε/kB, n = n∗/σ3); a dense
gas (T ∗ = 0.6, n∗ = 0.5); a liquid near the triple
point (T ∗ = 0.6, n∗ = 1.0) and a solid (T ∗ = 0.6,
n∗ = 1.5).

The time dependencies of the y-component veloc-
ity for one particle in the studied cell is submitted
in Fig. 1. On the basis of the comparative anal-
ysis we can reveal a clear distinction between the
behavior of particles in each model. For the case
of a low density gas (see Fig. 1) a weak correlation
between the particle velocity and time is observed.
It is connected with great (in comparison with the
size of particles) distances between particles and the
collisionless regime of their behavior. Within a long-
time limit weak correlations caused by interaction
of two (three) particles are detected. In the given
model the most chaotic behavior of a particle in all
the studied systems can be observed. Thus, the y-
component of a particle velocity of a dense gas (see
Fig. 1b) diﬀers in strong correlations with time.
The interval of ﬂuctuation scattering is relatively
ﬁxed. The model shows “moderate chaotization”
in the behavior of particles. The following model
corresponds to a liquid near the triple point (see
Fig. 1c) is characterized by the state of “moderate

The weakest correlations correspond to the y–component
of the particle velocity dynamics for a low density gas.
This dynamics characterizes the most chaotic behavior
of the particle motion in the studied models. With the
increase of density of the model system the correlation
in the behavior of particles become more intensive. A
model of a solid corresponds to the greatest probability of
interaction between particles and the strongest velocity
ﬂuctuations.

regularity” in the motion of particles. In compar-
ison with the previous models the correlation be-
tween the motion of molecules ampliﬁes noticeably.
The ampliﬁcation of correlations is connected to the
increase of the density of the system, accordingly,
to greater intensity of interaction of particles. The
amplitude of ﬂuctuations is found within a certain
interval of values. The obvious regularity in the
motion of real molecules corresponds to the model
of a solid state (see Fig. 1d). The diagram shows
appreciable symmetry of ﬂuctuations regarding the
value characterizing the condition of equilibrium in
the given model. A high degree of regularity is de-
ﬁned by a high degree of correlation of the states of
particles.

The phase portraits on plane projections of the
two ﬁrst orthogonal dynamic variables (W0, W1) are
submitted in Fig. 2. Here various degrees of ran-

two ﬁrst orthogonal dynamic variables (W0, W1) for the
considered model systems: a) for a low density gas; b)
for a dense gas; c) for a liquid near the triple point; d) for

randomness or regularity of the studied objects. Higher
symmetry and regular concentration of phase points con-
cerning the center of coordinates are characteristic for
objects with a high degree of regularity. Decreasing of
concentration of the phase points near center of coordi-
nates is connected with the increase of the level of ran-

In case of a
low density gas the individual points of the phase
portrait generate precise closed structures with a
complex chaotic form. In the next models the phase
points concentrate near to the center of the coordi-
nate system. The density of the phase cloud grows
with the growth of regularity of the model. Concen-
trated orbits, located around the central nucleus,
dissipate. The phase portraits of the solid model
are characterized by the greatest concentration of
the phase points near the origin of coordinates. It
is necessary to note that with the transition of the
system from a) to c) the ﬂuctuation scale of variable
W2 increases. The degree of changes of the orthog-
onal dynamic variables noticeably diﬀers owing to
the diﬀerence between the degree of correlations of
particles.

FIG. 3. The power spectrum of the initial time corre-
lation function µ0(ν) for four model systems. The pa-
rameter α was calculated for each power spectrum. By
estimating values α for each model system it is possible
to reveal its connection with a level of randomness or
regularity in the behavior of the system.

In Fig. 3 the power spectrum of the initial time
correlation function µ0(ν) for four model systems is
submitted. The fractal parameter α of the power
spectrum µ0(ν) ∼ να (where α < 0 ) was calculated
on all frequency scale for all model systems. For
a low density gas this parameter amounts to α =
−1.82; for a gas α = −1.75. For a liquid it is equal
to α = −1.63; for a solid α = −1.33. Thus, between
the fractal parameter of the power spectrum µ0(ν)
and the level of manifestation of a randomness and
stochastic behavior (the parameter α grows with the
increase of a regularity degree) there is appreciable
interrelation.

In Fig. 4 the frequency dependence of the ﬁrst
point of the non-Markovity parameter (further sim-
ply the non-Markovity parameter), calculated by
Eq. (10) is submitted.

While analyzing the majority of natural [14, 15]
and physical [23] systems earlier we found the fol-
lowing feature in the behavior of the ﬁrst point of
the non-Markovity parameter. The value ε1(0) ∼
101 ÷ 102 corresponds to the dynamic states of the
systems with the greatest level of randomness and
stochastic behavior. For the similar states pro-
nounced Markov eﬀects (manifestation of instanta-

FIG. 4. The frequency dependence of the ﬁrst point of
the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ν) for the considered
model systems. The analysis of various physical and nat-
ural systems speciﬁes a special value of the parameter
ε1(0) in the estimation of level of randomness or reg-
ularity. The parameter ε1(0) make it possible to judge
about the level of randomness or regularity in the system.
The maximal values of parameter ε1(0) (∼ 101 ÷ 102) are
characteristic for chaotic and fully randomized processes.
Decreasing of the parameter ε1(0) up to values ∼ 100 re-
ﬂects the increase of level of regularity. It is possible to
come to the similar conclusions by estimating the values
of this parameter for the submitted models.

neous or short-range statistical memory eﬀects) are
characteristic. With the increase of regularity and
robustness in the system the numerical value of the
ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter on zero
frequency decreases up to a unit ε1(0) ∼ 100. Non-
Markov processes with amplifying eﬀects of long-
range statistical memory correspond to such states.
The analysis of the model systems lead to the
similar results. The parameter ε1(0) for the model
of a low density gas (see Fig. 4) constitutes 29.76.
This is a maximal value of the non-Markovity pa-
rameter characterizing a low density gas i.e.
the
model with the greatest level of randomness and
strong Markovian eﬀects. The value of this param-
eter ε1(0) for a dense gas equal to 17.77, for a liquid
- 1.18, for a solid 1.14. With the increase of the den-
sity of the system the numerical value of the non-
Markovity parameter on zero frequency decreases to
a unit (with the increase of the density of the system

the non-Markovian eﬀects increase). This testiﬁes
to the possibility to use the non-Markovity parame-
ter as an informational measure of manifestation of
randomness and regularity eﬀects.

Thus, the submitted model systems allow to de-
ﬁne the set of qualitative and quantitative char-
acteristics for the analysis of a degree of random-
ness and non-Markov eﬀects in real complex sys-
tems. These characteristics carry detailed infor-
mation about randomness or regularity in the re-
searched system. To these characteristics we can
refer: the time correlation in the initial time series,
the shape of the phase clouds (W1 = f (W0)), the
fractal parameter of the power spectrum µ0(ν) and
the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter on
zero frequency ε1(0). The most authentic and in-
formative parameter of the level of randomness and
the manifestation of non-Markov eﬀects is the sta-
tistical non-Markovity parameter.

4.2 The analysis of the X-ray emission
intensity of the microquasar GRS
1915+105 for the series with a con-
stant time step

The time series of the X-ray emission intensity of
the microquasar GRS 1915+105 [34] during the pe-
riod from February, 1, to September, 1, 2004 (the
time discretization is equal to one day) is submitted
in Fig. 5. Here we ﬁnd the presence of quasiperiodic
structures which are connected to a relative regular-
ity of the signal within certain time intervals. It the
end of the time series the quasiperiodic structures
get most noisy therefore their form is destroyed.

The phase clouds on the plane projections for
various combinations of dynamical orthogonal vari-
ables Wi, Wj (where i, j = 0..3) of the X-ray inten-
sity of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 are shown
in Fig. 6. It is possible to judge the character of the
X-ray emission intensity by the shape of the phase
clouds. The phase clouds are of an asymmetric type
and consist of a centralized nucleus with a high con-
centration of phase points and several points sur-
rounding the nucleus.

(a) and three memory functions of the junior order (b,

GRS 1915+105 (for time series presented in Fig. 5).
The fractal parameter of the power spectrum µ0(ν) is
equal to α = −1.41. This value is an intermediate value
between the similar parameters for the models of a liquid
(α = −1.63) and a solid (α = −1.33).

power spectrum µ0(ν) is equal to α = −1.41. This
value corresponds to the intermediate quantity be-
tween the similar parameters for the model of a liq-
uid α = −1.63 and a solid α = −1.33. In the region
of frequencies ν=5.7× 10−2 ÷ 7.2× 10−2f.u.(1f.u. =
1/τ where τ is a discretization time step) a series
of dynamic peaks is detected in the power spectra.
This frequency range corresponds to a time interval
of τ = 13.8 ÷ 17.4 days. The maximal peak corre-
sponds to frequency ν = 6 × 10−2f.u., of τ = 16.6
days.

points of the non-Markovity parameter εi, where

Fig. 8. Of special value is the ﬁrst point of the
non-Markovity parameter on zero frequency ε1(0) =
4.94. This value occupies an intermediate position
between the appropriate values for a gas and a liq-
uid. For all the frequency dependencies in the region
of frequencies ν=0.057 ÷ 0.072f.u. a series of peaks
is detected.

The initial record of the X-ray emission intensity
of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 as a sequence
of events is submitted in Fig. 9. The given series
essentially diﬀers from the time series with a con-
stant time step (the registration was carried out in

FIG. 9. The discrete sequence of events in the X-ray
emission intensity of the microquasar GRS 1915+105
(time series with variable time step, mean time dis-
cretization is equal to 96 min). Each point in the given
sequence represents a single event of emission.

The power spectra of the initial ECF (Fig. 10)
and three memory functions of junior orders (Figs.
10b-d) are shown in Fig. 10. All the ﬁgures are
submitted on a double logarithmic scale. On the
whole frequency region of the power spectrum µ0(ν)
strong fractality with the exponent α = −1.53 (see
Fig. 10a) is observed. Let us note that the frac-
tal parameter for the series with a constant time
step corresponds to α = −1.41. Hence the initial
time signal registered with a variable time step is
characterized by greater randomness and stochastic
behavior in comparison with a signal with constant
time step. Memory functions µi(ν), where i = 1, 2, 3
(see Figs. 10b-d) manifest the similar fractal behav-
ior in a wide frequency interval.

In Fig. 11 the frequency dependencies of ﬁrst
three points of the non-Markovity parameter εi(ν)
(where i = 1, 2, 3) are submitted. The ﬁrst point
of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ν) in the event
presentation (see Fig.
11a) allows to reveal ad-
ditional features in relaxation processes of the X-

1915+105. The value of the parameter on zero fre-
quency has increased more than twice and is equal
to ε1(0) = 11.65. The similar behavior of the non-
Markovity parameter (for the series with a variable
time step) is connected with the ampliﬁcation of
quasi-Markovian and stochastic eﬀects in the X-ray
emission processes. In Fig. 11 markovization eﬀects
are observed in frequency behavior ε1(ν) as a peak
on frequency ν = 0.238 f.u (where 1f.u = 1/∆n,
∆n =1 event). The values of the two subsequent
points of the non-Markovity parameter (see Fig.
11b, c) are close to a unit and are of identical kind
for both time series.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

Energetic and spectral properties, quasi-periodic os-
cillations (QPO) and the diverse temporal variabil-
ity of GRS 1915+105 are the focus of numerous
studies in last years.

In the paper [37] the problem of the limits con-
cerning the physical information that can be ex-
tracted from the analysis of one or more time se-
ries typical of astrophysical objects has been con-
sidered. The work [38] has clearly established that

radio emission from GRS 1915+105 is intimately
related to the presence of hard (power-law domi-
nated) intervals in the X-ray light curves. This in
turn physically implies a clear relation between a
radiatively ineﬃcient ﬂow close to the black hole,
and a synchrotron-emitting overﬂow or jet. This
suggest that MHD eﬀects could be responsible for
the production and/or conﬁnement of the jets found
in system. For the ﬁrst time in Ref.
[39] were ob-
served concurrently in GRS 1915+105 all of the fol-
lowing properties: a strong steady optically thick
radio emission corresponding to a powerful compact
jet resolved with the VLBA, bright near-IR emis-
sion, a strong QPO at 2.5Hz in the X-rays and a
power law dominated spectrum without any cuttof
in the 3 − 400keV range.
J. Rodriguez et al.

in the work [40] have
presented the results of simulations INTEGRAL
and RXTE observations of the microquasar GRS
1915+105. They have focused on the analysis of the
unique highly variable observation and have shown
that they might have observed a new class of vari-
ability. Then they have studied the energetic de-
pendence of a low frequency QPO from steady ob-
servations.

A scenario for the variability of the microquasar
GRS 1915+105 starts from previous works, lead-
ing to the tentative identiﬁcation of the accretion-
ejection instability as the source of the low fre-
quency QPO and other accreting sources [41]. A
model for the ∼ 30 minute cycles often exhibited
by GRS 1915+105 is determined by the advection
of poloidal magnetic ﬂux to the inner region of
the disk, and its destruction by reconnection (lead-
ing to relativistic ejections) with the magnetic ﬂux
trapped in the vicinity of the central source. This
could be extrapolated further to understand the
long-term variability of this and other microquasars.
In the paper [42] authors discuss the possible ori-
gin of the following behavior: the QPO spectra are
well modelled with a cut-oﬀ power law except on
one occasion where a single power law gives a satis-
factory ﬁt (with no cut-oﬀ at least up to ∼ 40keV ).
The cut-oﬀ energy evolves signiﬁcantly from one ob-
servations to the other, from a value of ∼ 21.8keV
to ∼ 30keV in the other observations where it is

detected. It was suggested in the work [42] that the
compact jet detected in the radio contributes to the
hard X-ray (≥ 20keV ) mostly through synchrotron
emission, whereas the X-ray emitted below 20keV
would originate through inverse Compton scatter-
ing. The dependence of the QPO amplitude on the
energy can be understood if the modulation of the
X-ray ﬂux is contained in the Componized photons
and not in the synchrotron ones.

The variability pattern is characterized in Ref.
[43] by a pulsing behavior, consisting of a main pulse
and a shorter, softer, and smaller amplitude precur-
sor pulse, on a timescale of 5 minutes in the JEM-X
3 − 35keV light curve.
It was revealed, that the
rising phase is shorter and harder than the declin-
ing phase, which is opposite to what has been ob-
served in other otherwise similar variability classes
in this source. The ﬁt show the source to be in a soft
state characterized by a strong disc component be-
low ∼ 6keV and Comptonization by both thermal
and non-thermal electrons at higher energies.

The source, which was observed 3 times in the
plateau state, before and after a major radio and X-
ray ﬂare, showed strong steady optically thick radio
emission corresponding to powerful compact jet re-
solved in the radio emission corresponding to power-
ful compact jet resolved in the radio images, bright
near-infrared emission, a strong QPO at 2.5Hz in
the X-rays and a powerful law dominated spectrum
without cut-oﬀ in the 3 − 300keV range [44].

Relativistic jets are now in Ref. [45] believed to
be a fairly ubiquitous property of accreting com-
pact objects, and are intimately coupled with the
accretion history. Associated with rapid changes in
the accretion states of the binary systems, ejections
of relativistic plasma can be observed at radio fre-
quencies on timescale of weeks before becoming un-
detectable. However, recent observations point to
long-term eﬀects of these ejecta on the interstellar
medium with the formation of large scale relativistic
jets around binary systems.

In Ref.

[46] authors by Rossi X-ray Timing Ex-
plorer have found that as the radio emission be-
comes brighter and optically thick, the frequency of
a ubiquitous 0.5−10Hz QPO decreases, the Fourier
phase lags between hard (11.5 − 60keV ) and soft

(2 − 4.3keV ) in the frequency range of 0.01 − 10Hz
change sign from negative to positive, the coher-
ence between hard and soft photons at low frequen-
cies decreases, and the relativistic amount of low-
frequency power in hard photons compared to soft
photons decreases.

Energetic dependence of a low frequency QPO
in GRS 1915+105 have been analyzed in the work
[47]. The results presented could ﬁnd an explana-
tion in the context of the Accretion-Ejection Insta-
bility, which could appear as a rotating spiral or
hot point located in the disk, between its innermost
edge and the co-rotation radius.

In the present work the dynamic features in the
behavior of a particle in the given cell in condensed
matter and the X-ray emission intensity of the mi-
croquasar GRS 1915+105 were considered jointly
on the basis of the statistical theory of non-Markov
processes. For this purpose we used two various ap-
plications of the submitted theory as it allows to
estimate chaotic and regular, random and stochas-
tic, Markov and non-Markov processes deﬁning the
dynamics of the studied system. By taking into
account the eﬀects of discreteness, long-range and
short-range memory, statistical relaxation now we
are able to deﬁne a set of valuable parameters and
characteristics, which contain detailed information
about the properties of the studied systems con-
nected with randomness.

On the basis of the comparative analysis of the
initial time series, phase portraits, power spectra
of the initial TCF and the ﬁrst point of the non-
Markovity parameter we have found some typical
features of the behavior of regular and chaotic,
Markov and non-Markov components of stochas-
tic processes in studied systems. The systems with
high level of chaotization (a low density gas, a dense
gas) are characterized by weak correlation between
the initial signals, the presence of complex chaotic
closed structures in the phase portraits, the high
value of the fractal parameter (according to its ab-
solute value) of the power spectrum of TCF and the
big value of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity pa-
rameter on zero frequency. In the similar systems
the eﬀects of short-range or instantaneous statisti-
cal memory that correspond to Markovian processes

appear. In regular stochastic processes strong cor-
relations in the initial time signals, clear symmetric
structures of phase clouds are observed. The last
one consists of centralized nucleus of high concentra-
tion. Here low values of the fractal parameter (ac-
cording to its absolute value) of the power spectrum
of the initial TCF, small values of the ﬁrst point
of the non-Markovity parameter on zero frequency
are observed. In the similar systems the eﬀects of
long-range statistical memory can be seen, and re-
laxation time scales of TCF and memory functions
are comparable. The processes describing the given
systems are non-Markov ones.

The use of the above submitted technique allows
to estimate non-Markov eﬀects, robustness and reg-
ularity, stochastic behavior and randomness of the
X-ray emission intensity of the microquasar GRS
1915+105 when the initial signal with constant time
step is registered. Here the scale of time ﬂuctu-
ations, long-range eﬀects of memory, discreteness
of various processes and states, eﬀects of dynamic
alternation in the intensity of the X-ray emission
play an important role.
In the dynamics of the
initial time signal of the X-ray emission intensity
the fast change of various regimes, sharp and unex-
pected alternation of various types of ﬂuctuations
and correlations were observed. Taking into account
discreteness of the experimental data, statistical ef-
fects of long-range memory and the constructive role
of ﬂuctuations and correlations we have received a
detailed information about the properties and pa-
rameters which characterize statistical properties of
the ﬂuctuating X-ray emission of microquasar GRS
1915+105.

Thus, in this work, a new approach to the descrip-
tion of discrete non-Markov stochastic processes
with a variable time step in the event representa-
tion is presented. This approach is based on the
consecutive use of the idea suggesting the existence
of the event correlation functions. The similar cor-
relation functions are new physical quantities de-
termining probabilistic interrelation between a se-
quence of events. When analyzing the time sig-
nal (the X-ray emission intensity of the microquasar
GRS 1915+105) with a variable time step the fol-
lowing characteristics were determined: the power

spectra of the initial correlation function and mem-
ory functions of the junior orders, ﬁrst three points
of the non-Markovity parameter, the fractal param-
eter of the power spectrum of ECF and the value of
the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter on
zero frequency. These dependencies and parameters
allow to receive additional information about the
properties and characteristics of the studied system:
the quasi-Markov character of relaxation processes
in the intensity of the X-ray emission, ampliﬁcation
of Markov eﬀects on certain frequencies, the fractal
character of the power spectra of ECF and memory
functions.

Finally, this paper only takes the ﬁrst step in in-
troducing the concept of event correlation analysis
of time series and deﬁning it in terms of quanti-
ties that can be calculated from an experimental
data. We believe, the method developed can form a
basis to start formulating further meaningful ques-
tions regarding the notions and presentations for
real complex systems.

Abstract

Two fundamental quantities for characterizing nonlinear wave phenomena in plasmas are
the spectral energy transfer associated with the energy redistribution between Fourier modes,
and the linear growth rate. It is shown how these quantities can be estimated simultaneously
from dual-spacecraft data using Volterra series models. We consider magnetic ﬁeld data gath-
ered upstream the Earth’s quasiparallel bow shock, in which Short Large Amplitude Magnetic
Structures (SLAMS) supposedly play a leading role. The analysis attests the dynamic evolu-
tion of the SLAMS and reveals an energy cascade toward high-frequency waves. These results
put constraints on possible mechanisms for the shock front formation.

Introduction

In this paper, a Volterra series representation is used to describe the nonlinear evolution in time
and in space of a ﬂuctuating wave ﬁeld. The basis for this approach is that plasmas can often be
viewed as a causal nonlinear system (a “black box”) that reacts to a given excitation by giving a
response. By modeling the nonlinear transfer function associated with this system, deeper insight
can be gained into the underlying physics.

The analysis of the nonlinear transfer function is detailed here for the particular case where two-
point measurements are available. First, we show how to model the dynamical response. Then, the

1

physical interpretation of the model coeﬃcients is given. Particular attention is paid to the linear
growth rate, which expresses the linear instability of the wave ﬁeld, and to the spectral energy
transfer, which describes how the instabilities saturate through nonlinear wave interactions.

We apply this method to magnetic ﬁeld data gathered by the dual AMPTE satellites near
the Earth’s quasiparallel bow shock. This data set corresponds to a regime of quasi-stationary
turbulence in a collisionless plasma; it has received much interest in relation with the existence of
Short Large Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) [Schwartz et al., 1992]. It is shown how a
transfer function analysis reveals the role played by these nonlinear structures.

This paper is divided in three parts. The experimental context is described in section 2.
Sections 3 to 7 are devoted to data analysis aspects with a description of the model, the choice
of its parameters, and its validation. Finally, in sections 8 and 9, experimental data are analyzed
and interpreted.

2 The Experimental Context

The magnetic ﬁeld data of interest were gathered by the dual Active Magnetospheric Particle
Tracer Explorers spacecraft (United Kingdom Satellite (AMPTE-UKS) and Ion Release Module
(AMPTE-IRM)) on day 304 of 1984 just upstream the Earth’s quasi-parallel bow shock. Several
studies have already been devoted to this particular event [Schwartz and Burgess, 1991, Schwartz
et al., 1992; Mann et al., 1994; Dudok de Wit and Krasnosel’skikh, 1995; Dudok de Wit et al.,
1995], which provides a paradigm for nonlinear eﬀects in turbulence. The spacecraft were closely
following each other on the same outbound orbit (with a separation of δx = 144 km), depicted in
Figure 1.

A distinctive feature of the studied region is the occurrence of SLAMS, which supposedly play
a leading role in the shock front formation [Schwartz et al., 1992]. The shock wave is caused by the
sudden deceleration of the supersonic solar wind at the encounter of the Earth’s magnetosphere.

2

The SLAMS grow out of low-frequency waves that propagate away from the shock front but are
convected back toward the Earth by the solar wind [Thomsen et al., 1990]. This steepening process
is likely to result from an interaction with ion beams coming from the shock front [Scholer, 1993].
There are several open questions regarding the role played by SLAMS. Quasi-parallel shocks
are currently viewed either as an entity [Winske et al., 1990] or as a patchy transition zone made
by a merging of SLAMS [Schwartz and Burgess, 1991]. The relationship between the SLAMS
and the whistler wave packets that frequently occur at their leading edge is not well understood
either, although there is numerical [Omidi and Winske, 1990] and experimental [Dudok de Wit and
Krasnosel’skikh, 1995] evidence for a causal link between the two.

Figure 2: Excerpt of the time evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude, as measured by the two
spacecraft. A typical SLAMS appears at t =71 s. The precursor whistler wave appears at its
trailing edge since the wave ﬁeld is convected backward by the strong solar wind.

An excerpt of the magnetometer data is shown in Figure 2. The trajectory of the spacecraft,
the prevailing magnetic ﬁeld and the average solar wind velocity (vsw = 370 km/s) are all parallel
within a few degrees. This is an important point since it means that both spacecraft see the same
structures, separated by a time interval of about 1 s. A comparative analysis should therefore
reveal how the wave ﬁeld, and in particular the SLAMS, evolve as they move from one spacecraft
to the other. We do this by building a Volterra model that tries to predict the wave ﬁeld of
AMPTE-IRM using the data of AMPTE-UKS as input.

Each spacecraft provides a data set which consists of the three components of the magnetic
ﬁeld, measured immediately upstream the shock front. For each component the number of samples
is 4521; the data were sampled at a constant rate of 8 Hz after being low-pass ﬁltered at 4 Hz. We
have chosen to consider the three components as diﬀerent ensembles, thereby artiﬁcially increasing
the sample size by a factor of 3. The anisotropy of the wave ﬁeld a priori does not justify such
an approximation, but no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between the model coeﬃcients as
estimated separately from each component. An obvious future extension would be to have a model
that takes into account the vectorial nature of the wave ﬁeld.

The power spectral density of the wave ﬁeld is illustrated in Figure 3a and can be qualiﬁed
as being continuous and essentially featureless. Notice that all frequencies are expressed in the

3

spacecraft reference frame, in which they are Doppler-shifted by the strong solar wind. The spectral
densities are almost the same for the two spacecraft. Figure 3b shows the wave ﬁeld probability
distribution, which has non-Gaussian tails. The departure from Gaussianity should be underlined,
since it is a necessary condition for having nonlinear wave-wave interactions [Kim and Powers,
1979].

3 Modeling the Nonlinear Transfer Function

Much work has been done on the theory of nonlinear transfer functions in turbulence [e.g., Monin
and Yaglom, 1975; Krommes, 1997] but relatively little is known about their inference from exper-
imental data, which can be an unwieldy task. Early results were obtained in the context of neutral
ﬂuid turbulence [Uberoi, 1963; Van Atta and Chen, 1969; Lii et al., 1982; Ritz et al., 1988a] and
later in plasmas [Ritz and Powers, 1986; Ritz et al., 1988b; Ritz et al., 1989; Kim et al., 1996].
Powers, Ritz and their coworkers contributed to the development of a computational framework for
two-point measurements [Ritz and Powers, 1986; Ritz et al., 1989], thereby rendering the technique

4

easily accessible to a large class of experiments. Their results, however, have remained overlooked,
presumably because of the apparent computational investment and the diﬃculty in validating es-
timates that are prone to errors. In this paper we show how to increase the robustness of the
estimates by using continuous wavelet transforms instead of the usual Fourier transform.

3.1 Volterra Series

Consider a stationary wave ﬁeld which is measured in time and in space, and let y(x, t) denote
ﬂuctuations around a ﬁxed value. We are interested in describing the dynamics of this wave ﬁeld
with the following general model:

∂y(x, t)
∂x

= F

y(x, t)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

,

where F (y) is a continuous, nonlinear and time-invariant operator. Wiener [1958] showed that for
a large class of causal systems F (y) can be expanded as a Volterra (or Volterra-Fr´echet-Wiener)
series [Schetzen, 1980], which we write here after taking the Fourier transform of the time variable

∂y(x, ω)
∂x

= Γ(ω) y(x, ω)

· · ·

y(x, ω3) δ(ω1 + ω2 + ω3 −

×

ω) dω1dω2dω3

The kernels Γ are directly related to the higher-order spectra of the process and have a physical
meaning. Γ(ω), Γ(ω1, ω2), and Γ(ω1, ω2, ω3) are respectively called the linear, quadratic, and cubic
interaction terms. The generic situation corresponds to a leading linear term, which describes the
linear dynamics of the system, such as the linear growth rate and the dispersion. The quadratic
term expresses three-wave processes in which interactions occur within triads of waves that satisfy
the resonance condition

ω = ω1 + ω2 .

The cubic term similarly describes four-wave processes whose frequencies satisfy the selection rules

ω = ω1 + ω2 + ω3 or ω + ω1 = ω2 + ω3 .

The main motivation for using a Volterra series expansion stems from its ability to describe var-
ious weakly nonlinear processes in plasmas [Kadomtsev, 1982], ranging from generic drift wave
turbulence [Balk et al., 1990; Horton and Hasegawa, 1994] to Langmuir turbulence as described by
the Zakharov equations [Musher et al., 1995]. Particular attention has been given to Hamiltonian
systems [Zakharov et al., 1985] in which the kernels can be calculated explicitly. The resonant

5

(2)

(4)

interactions deﬁned by (3) and (4) are further known to be the building elements of turbulence as
observed in collisionless plasmas: the decay and modulational instabilities, for example, are ade-
quately described in terms of three-wave and four-wave interactions [Krasnosel’skikh and Lefeuvre,
1993].

Theoretical and experimental considerations show that for weak turbulence the low-order
Volterra kernels are the predominant ones. Indeed, the characteristic timescale associated with
the action of a qth-order kernel increases with q, making low-order kernels much more likely to
rule the dynamics [Zakharov et al., 1985]. In practice, (2) may thus safely be truncated after the
cubic term and quite often even a quadratically nonlinear model suﬃces.

3.2 Strong Versus Weak Turbulence

The nonlinear model of (2) formally applies to weak turbulence only, in which the dispersion and
the characteristic growth rates of the Fourier modes are small. Solar wind turbulence, on the other
hand, is often considered as being of the strong turbulence type. The region we study is actually a
mixture between the two since the dynamical properties of the wave ﬁeld are dominated by a small
population of energetic ions interacting with a plasma of the weak turbulence type. The weakness
of the dispersion [Dudok de Wit et al.,, 1995] and the relatively small value of the linear growth
rate (see Section 8) support the validity of the weak turbulence approximation here.

The extension from weak to strong turbulence as a ﬁrst approximation implies a loosening of
the resonance conditions (equations (3)-(5)) to account for the ﬁnite bandwidth of the wave packets
[Horton and Hasegawa, 1994]. We shall take this spectral broadening implicitly into account by
projecting the wave ﬁeld on wavelets instead of Fourier modes (see Section 5).

3.3 Spatial Versus Temporal Description

Equation (2) is actually a particular case of a class of models that describe both the spatial
and the temporal structure of the wave ﬁeld. In a more general setting, both wavenumbers and
frequencies must satisfy resonance conditions. Energy and momentum conservation force three-
wave interactions to occur along the resonant manifold

ω(k1 + k2) = ω1(k1) + ω2(k2) ,

(5)

where k denotes the wave-number vector.

The wavenumber dependence of the interaction is often omitted by lack of spatially resolved
experiments. It raises an important point, which is the separation between spatial and temporal
scales, and the distinction between stationarity and homogeneity. In our experiment, the wave ﬁeld
is convected past the satellites by the solar wind and so the angular frequency ωsat we observe in
the spacecraft frame is in fact Doppler-shifted, giving, ωsat = ωpl + k
vsw. However, because the
wavenumber k and the solar wind velocity vsw are almost parallel, and because of the fast solar
k vsw. This expression suggests that the spatial
wind, we may approximate ωsat ≈
structure of the wave ﬁeld, projected on the solar wind velocity vector, can be probed simply by
measuring the time evolution and viceversa. This approximation is known as the Taylor hypothesis

ωpl + k vsw ≈

and allows us to exchange temporal dynamics and spatial structure

(6)

There now remains to convert the Eulerian representation of the experiment into a Lagrangian
one, in which the magnetic structures are followed from one spacecraft to the other. A space-time
representation of the spacecraft (see Figure 4) indeed reveals that by taking the diﬀerence of the
spacecraft signals, we mix the wave ﬁeld time derivative and the spatial gradient. A Galilean

3.4 Inferring the Model Coeﬃcients

Physical insight into our model can be gained by introducing the real-valued density of waves
E(ω, x), by analogy to the number of quasi particles in condensed matter theory. For a large
ensemble of waves with diﬀerent frequencies, the random-phase approximation holds, giving

used the Taylor hypothesis (equation (6)) to interchange spatial and temporal derivatives. The
quantities of interest are the average linear growth rate in time

and the average quadratic energy transfer rate

The latter attests the existence of nonlocal interactions which are a hallmark of nonlinearity.
Equation (8) shows that the energy ﬂux in Fourier space ∂E/∂t results from a balance between
energy dissipation (or gain) at a given frequency ω and spectral energy transfers between ω and
other frequencies.

Nonlinear transfer functions have the advantage of revealing both the magnitude and the orien-
tation of spectral energy ﬂuxes: positive values of T (ω1, ω2) correspond to three-wave interactions
in which spectral components with angular frequencies ω1 > 0 and ω2 > 0 transfer energy to
ω. Conversely, negative values
the component ω = ω1 + ω2. We shall write this as ω1 + ω2 →
correspond to decay processes ω
→

There is a close resemblance between the deﬁnition of the energy transfer function (equation

ω1 + ω2.

(10)) and that of the auto bispectrum [Mendel, 1991],

which has been widely used for quantifying quadratic wave interactions in plasmas [Kim and
Powers, 1979; Lagoutte et al., 1989; LaBelle and Lund, 1992; P´ecseli et al., 1993; Dudok de Wit
and Krasnosel’skikh, 1995; Bale et al., 1996]. Transfer functions, however, are more informative
since they detect the presence of nonlinear interactions between the observation points irrespective
of what happened farther upstream. Consider for example a wave ﬁeld that underwent nonlinear
interactions during its early history but is now fully static. This wave ﬁeld will have a nonzero cross-
bispectrum even though nonlinear interactions aren’t actually taking place. A nonzero bispectrum
thus does not necessarily attest the existence of wave-wave interactions at the observation point.
Such a caveat was put forward in an analytic example by P´ecseli and Trulsen [1993]. The energy
transfer function on the contrary detects whether energy is being exchanged between spectral
modes, causing the amplitudes and the phases to vary locally in time and in space. This new
information can be accessed only by comparing the wave ﬁeld as it goes from one observation
point to the other. Finally, we note that the existence of energy transfers presupposes a weak
nonstationarity or inhomogeneity of the wave ﬁeld.

3.5 Symmetries

The real-valued nature of the data and the deﬁnition of the transfer function automatically give
rise to a number of symmetry relations, which shrink the principal domain in frequency space,
signiﬁcantly reducing the number of model coeﬃcients to be computed [see Nam and Powers,

8

1994]. The principal domain of the energy transfer function is even smaller, since for ω1 + ω2 = ω
we have

T (ω1, ω2) = T (ω2, ω1) =

T (ω,

ω1) =

T (ω,

ω2) .

4 Estimating the Nonlinear Transfer Function

Our principal problem is the robust estimation of Volterra kernels from ﬁnite and noise-corrupted
data. This problem may be alleviated by assuming a Gaussian probability distribution of the wave
ﬁeld, since the diﬀerent regressors can then be identiﬁed separately. This assumption, however,
rarely holds in practice. Incidentally, it is precisely the nonlinearity that causes the distribution to
depart from Gaussianity. We therefore follow a more general procedure along the line developed
by Ritz and Powers [1986] and later improved by Kim and Powers, [1988].

For discrete values of the frequency and with two-point measurements, (2) becomes

Equation (15) formally represents a nonlinear transfer function that links an output Yω (the
waveform of AMPTE-IRM) to an input Uω (the waveform of AMPTE-UKS). The estimation of
the linear part of such a transfer function is a central problem in system identiﬁcation, for which
well-established techniques exist [Ljung, 1987; Priestley, 1981]. Comparatively few experimental
eﬀorts, however, have been directed toward the robust estimation of quadratic and higher-order
transfer functions [Tick, 1961; Brillinger, 1970; Billings, 1980; Bendat, 1990]. For the sake of
simplicity, we shall henceforth restrict ourselves to quadratically nonlinear models.

The simplest solution consists in selecting the model whose coeﬃcients minimize the squared

The leading matrix (also called higher-order autocovariance matrix) can be divided into four
blocks, one with a second order moment (the power spectral density), two with third-order moments
(the bispectra) and one with fourth-order moments. The fact that moments of various orders are
needed to properly estimate the linear properties of the wave ﬁeld recalls the well-known closure
problem which is ubiquitous in the spectral modelling of turbulence. Equation (20) also shows
how the non-Gaussian nature of the wave ﬁeld enters the results. If the wave ﬁeld were Gaussian,
then the oﬀ-diagonal blocks of the higher-order autocovariance matrix would vanish and a separate
estimation of the diﬀerent Volterra kernels would be possible.

5 Wavelet Versus Fourier Transform

For the solution of (20) to be numerically stable and physically relevant, it is essential to have
Nc (Nc is the number of unknown coeﬃcients) and Uω nonsingular. A compromise is
Nens ≫
thus needed between Nens and the number of diﬀerent Fourier modes Nω, hereafter referred to
as the mesh resolution. Usually, time series are divided into (possibly overlapping) sequences,
each of which is Fourier transformed. A better compromise can be achieved with wavelets, which
oﬀer additional resolution in time at the expense of a lower frequency resolution. The continuous
wavelet transform of y(t) is deﬁned as

Compared to windowed Fourier transforms, the wavelet transforms yield statistically better
behaved estimates of the spectral properties [van Milligen et al., 1995; Dudok de Wit and Kras-
nosel’skikh, 1995]. Our motivation, however, is not just computational but also stems from the
ability of wavelets to resolve transient and soliton-like features [Farge et al., 1996]. Indeed, the
strongly turbulent magnetic ﬁeld shows transient structures that are more akin to wavelets than
to coherent waves with an inﬁnite extension.

The main drawback of this approach is its greater computational burden, since the number of
ensembles Nens now almost equals the number of samples. Furthermore, we are left with a free
parameter, the wavelet width σ. Since a ﬁxed mesh resolution is wanted, with no spectral overlap
between adjacent components Yωj and Yωj+1 , we adapt the wavelet width to the frequency in order
to have σ

from being too much distorted.

6 Validation Criteria for the Transfer Function Model

Validation is a key issue in Volterra model identiﬁcation. There exists no single satisfactory cri-
terion for performing such a validation, but to a large extent we can rely on well-established
techniques that have been developed for linear systems [Ljung, 1987].

Since our problem involves the solution of a linear system of equations, a good starting point
is an inspection of the degree of independence between the columns of the matrix Uω (equation
(19)) and the output Yω. The correlation function between Yω and the ﬁrst column of Uω

indicates how well the linear transfer function succeeds in predicting the output. This is the
coherence function, which is bounded between 0 and 1. Likewise, the correlation function between
the output and other columns of the matrix gives

This is the cross-bicoherence, i.e., the cross-bispectrum normalized to the power spectral density.
Its value is bounded between zero for uncorrelated waves and unity for triads of waves whose
phases are totally correlated. For a cubic model, one similarly deﬁnes the cross-tricoherence,
which quantiﬁes the strength of four-wave interactions

Note that there exist variants of these deﬁnitions [e.g. Kravtchenko-Berejnoi et al., 1995].

Higher-order coherence functions reveal which spectral components are likely to be involved
in nonlinear interactions. They do not, however, tells us whether the model is actually good in
predicting the wave ﬁeld. A high bicoherence, for example, does not yet justify the choice of
a quadratically nonlinear model. A more global ﬁgure of merit is obtained by comparing the

7 Choosing the Right Model

The choice of the model parameters involves three main issues. More speciﬁc aspects are deferred
to the appendix.

7.1 Choice of the Model Order

The basic question of the model order should ideally be answered by computing Volterra kernels
for various orders and truncating the series as soon as they become negligible. The ﬁnite size of
the data does not allow this, so the question should rather be: How faithfully does a truncated
low-order model reproduce the observed dynamics ?

As mentioned before, there are several reasons to believe that a low-order model should capture
most of the dynamics, especially in weak turbulence. This can be veriﬁed in diﬀerent ways. Ritz
and Powers [1986] considered nonlinear correlations between linear and nonlinear terms. We focus
instead on the predictive capacity of the models, using the cross-validation deﬁned in (26). We

12

built ﬁrst-, second-, and third-order models, all of which were tested against the data (the third
order model could could not have as much frequency resolution because of its large number of
degrees of freedom).

Figure 5 shows the result of the cross-validation applied to a linear and to a quadratically
nonlinear model. Both models succeed relatively well in predicting the low frequency part of
the AMPTE-IRM waveform. The performance drop with increasing frequency is a well-known
eﬀect, which cannot be compensated simply by increasing the model complexity. Possible causes
are the decreasing signal-to-noise ratio, the ﬁnite lifetime and the dispersion of the wave packets,
ﬂuctuations in the solar wind velocity, and the 1-D approximation of our model.

The central result here is the close performance of the linear and the quadratic models, which
attests the predominantly linear behavior of the wave ﬁeld and a priori supports the choice of a
low-order model. A notable exception occurs around f = ω/2π
0.5 Hz, where a quadratic model
brings some improvement. This shall see later that nonlinear eﬀects are indeed important in that
frequency band.

≈

7.2 Choice of the Frequency Range

There is a strong impetus for reducing as much as possible the number of degrees of freedom
of our model. One way of doing this is by reducing the frequency range. As shown in Figure 5,
ﬂuctuations with frequencies beyond 0.8 Hz cannot be satisfactorily modeled and so one may safely
truncate the frequency range at 1 Hz, above which the power spectral content becomes negligible
anyway. We checked that higher-order coherence functions vanish as well above 1 Hz.

A further reduction in the number of degrees of freedom can in principle be achieved by dis-
carding in the linear system (equation (18)) those columns of the matrix which are not signiﬁcantly
correlated with the output Yω. Such a reduction is permitted when the nonlinear interactions are
very localized in frequency space.

7.3 Choice of the Mesh Resolution

The frequency spacing δω (which is proportional to 1/Nω) must be small enough to distinguish
important features such as spectral lines and yet as large as possible to prevent the model from
being overdetermined. Since we deal with broadband turbulence, a relatively coarse mesh should
a priori suﬃce. Nonlinear parametric models [Billings, 1980] may be needed when closely spaced
lines must be resolved.

0.5 Hz.

≈

The impact of the mesh resolution is best revealed by the condition number [Golub and Van
Loan, 1993] of the matrix Uω, which gives a ﬁgure of merit for the ill-posedness of (18). The
condition number is at best 1 and typically should not exceed a few hundreds; its value is displayed
in Figure 6 for diﬀerent mesh resolutions. The condition degrades for increasing Nω because
more coeﬃcients have to be estimated from the same sample; another reason is the increasing
collinearity between columns of Uω. These problems may be partially alleviated by projecting Uω
on an orthogonal basis [see Im et al., 1996].

From these considerations, we choose a quadratically nonlinear model with Nω = 40 and a

14

frequency range from 0 to 1 Hz.

8 Linear Properties of the Wave Field

We now focus on the interpretation of the model and start with the leading term, which is the
linear one. The linear kernel Γω can conveniently be split into a real and an imaginary part

The average dispersion relation k(ω) is shown in Figure 7. Given our timing convention, we
are in the plasma rest frame and positive wavenumbers correspond to a sunward motion. Error
bars correspond to one standard deviation as calculated from the least-squares ﬁt of the model.

Figure 7 shows that the wave ﬁeld is essentially dispersionless up to about 0.5 Hz. Above this
frequency, the dispersion becomes positive, and high-frequency waves move ahead of low-frequency
ones. We refer to previous work [Dudok de Wit et al., 1995] for a discussion on this, but just note
that the modeling fails above 0.6 Hz, presumably because of the low power spectral density.

gives the linear growth averaged as before over k. The results are shown in Figure 7. The negative
value of γ(ω) attests a damping of the waves, so we conclude that the wave ﬁeld is on average
linearly stable. An exception occurs below 0.2 Hz, where the wave ﬁeld grows as it goes from one
spacecraft to the other. Although this growth rate is subject to a rather large uncertainty, its
positive sign is statistically signiﬁcant. Interestingly, this unstable frequency band coincides with
that of the SLAMS and therefore lends strong support to the instability of these structures. The
unstable nature of the SLAMS has already been conjectured [Schwartz and Burgess, 1991], but we
now have the ﬁrst direct evidence for a dynamic evolution.

From the linear growth rate, one can estimate the characteristic time needed for the SLAMS to

grow, assuming that there is no nonlinear mechanism to saturate such a growth. We ﬁnd τ = 1/γ
10 s, a value that should be compared to the characteristic lifetime of these structures

This ratio is suﬃciently small to justify a linearization of the growth process (and the weak turbu-
lence approximation) and yet large enough to make the instability of the SLAMS easily detectable.
It is instructive to check here the assumption of nonlinearity by comparing these results to
what we would obtain by ﬁtting a linear model. The two growth rates are compared in Figure 7
and a discrepancy appears. We attribute this to the energy redistribution process between Fourier
modes, which is neglected in the linear model and correctly taken into account in the nonlinear
one. As we shall see later, the linear model tries to compensate an energy ﬂux around 0.5 Hz by
artiﬁcially lowering the damping rate. The use of a nonlinear model for assessing linear properties
should therefore not be underestimated.

9 Nonlinear Properties of the Wave Field

We now consider the properties of the second-order Volterra kernel. As mentioned before, this is
the only nonlinear term we can reliably estimate given the amount of data.

16

9.1 Phase Couplings

The second-order Volterra kernels Γ(ω1, ω2) as such are not very informative, even though they
contain all the relevant information on the quadratic couplings. Better insight can be gained by
looking at the the cross-bicoherence (equation (24)), which is indicative of the strength of the
quadratic interactions.
In the same way, we compute the cross-tricoherence (equation (25)) to
study cubic interactions, even though the third-order kernel itself cannot be reliably estimated.

The cross-bicoherence and cross-tricoherence are displayed in Figures 8 and 9 respectively. In
both Figures 8 and 9 the support is restricted to the nonredundant and positive frequency domain.
The most conspicuous result is the presence of local maxima that attest the existence of phase
couplings between speciﬁc spectral modes. We conclude from the cross-bicoherence that a signif-
icant phase coupling occurs between wave packets whose frequencies satisfy the summation rule
0.1 + 0.45 = 0.55 Hz. The cross-tricoherence reveals a signiﬁcant coupling for 0.1 + fl + fm = 0.55
Hz, with 0.1
0.55 Hz. Both couplings relate wave packets whose frequencies are about
0.1 Hz and 0.55 Hz, with possibly some intermediate frequencies to enable the phase coupling. As
shown in previous work [Dudok de Wit and Krasnosel’skikh, 1995], these characteristic frequencies
respectively correspond to the SLAMS and to the discrete whistler wave packets that frequently
occur at the leading edge of SLAMS. The nonzero cross-bicoherence and cross-tricoherence thus
reveal the existence of a causal relationship between the SLAMS and the whistlers.

9.2 Energy Transfers

The last step now consists in determining whether the SLAMS and the whistlers are exchanging
energy or if they are just remnants of a process that took place farther upstream. To do so, we
compute the quadratic energy transfer function, shown in Figure 10. A signiﬁcant energy ﬂux
appears at 0.1 + 0.45
0.55 Hz, which corresponds to an energy transfer going from the SLAMS
to the whistlers. This is the central result of our paper, from which we conclude that the whistlers
are much more likely to be a decay product of the SLAMS than some instability triggered by
them. Such a conclusion was partly anticipated, but only the energy transfer function can give
unambiguous evidence for it.

P

At low frequencies (f < 0.2 Hz) the growth rate and the energy transfer indeed approximately
cancel each other and so the wave ﬁeld amplitude should not vary much in time. We conclude
that the decay of the SLAMS is approximately compensated by their linear instability. At higher
frequencies the power balance becomes increasingly negative, suggesting that the waves are on
average damped. A plausible damping mechanism would be resonant particle damping, but the
various approximations made in our model may actually cause the damping to be overestimated
at high frequencies (see the appendix).

9.4 Interpretation

A coherent scenario now emerges, which is schematized in Figure 12. The SLAMS appear as
dynamically evolving structures that progressively grow out of the wave ﬁeld by drawing energy
from energetic ions. As they grow, nonlinear eﬀects enter into play. The transfer function analysis
shows that the dominant process is a nonlinear wave interaction that compensates the growth by an
energy transfer toward high-frequency whistler waves (some energy may also go into low-frequency
waves). The whistler waves in turn move ahead of the SLAMS because of the positive dispersion
and are eventually damped by dissipation.

where the energy enters the wave ﬁeld and where it is transferred before being dissipated. The
SLAMS are located in the hatched zone.

The emergence of such right-handed circularly polarized waves out of the left-handed linearly
polarized SLAMS shows some striking similarities with the expected behavior of solitary waves
[Hada et al., 1989] and also recalls the behavior of shock fronts in weakly dispersive media [Karp-
man, 1975]. All these phenomena have in common a competition between dispersion and nonlin-
earity, whose distinctive manifestation is the resilience of the shape of the SLAMS.

To ﬁnish, let us visualize how the nonlinear interactions show up in the time domain. Figure 13
represents a particular SLAMS with the measured and the predicted wave ﬁeld. We decomposed
the latter into its linear and quadratic contributions. As expected, the linear contribution captures
most of the dynamics but does not correctly reproduce the fast oscillations at the leading edge of
the SLAMS and which correspond to a distorted whistler wave packet. A quadratic contribution
is deﬁnitely needed here to ﬁt the observations.

10 Conclusions

This study reveals how Volterra models can be used to infer nonlinear properties from a turbulent
wave ﬁeld using two-point measurements. Provided the model is carefully validated, it can give
direct access to the wave ﬁeld growth rate and to the energy transfer function.

We used the Volterra approach to analyze plasma turbulence as observed just upstream the
Earth’s quasi-parallel bow shock by the AMPTE spacecraft. An important feature of the wave
ﬁeld is the occurrence of nonlinear magnetic structures termed SLAMS. Our analysis attests the
coexistence of two competing mechanisms: the SLAMS progressively grow by drawing energy
from hot ions but before overturning they saturate and release the excess of energy into high
frequency whistler waves that move ahead of them due to dispersion. The dynamical evolution of
the SLAMS and their diﬀerential velocity [Schwartz et al., 1992] support the conjecture in which
they supposedly merge into an extended front that constitutes the bow shock.

The method we advocate here is applicable to other types of events provided they are recorded

A number of improvements can be made, such as the generalization to vector ﬁelds, which would
allow anisotropy eﬀects to be included. In some cases the addition of a source term that enforces
the stationarity of the wave ﬁeld may be desirable.

A Appendix: Limitations of the Technique

The nonlinear transfer function cannot be meaningfully assessed without keeping in mind several
limitations and potential pitfalls. The most important ones are listed here.

21

A.1 One-Dimensional Approach

Restricting the analysis to two probes means that we can only study structures propagating par-
allel to the spacecraft separation vector. Structures propagating obliquely to it will cause an
overestimation of the damping rate and an underestimation of the energy transfer.

A.2 Anisotropy

Our scalar model can in principle be generalized to vectorial quantities with the interesting per-
spective of addressing anisotropy eﬀects. The price to pay for this is a larger number of degrees
of freedom. Neglecting the vectorial nature of the variables may actually alter the power balance
because of the omission of the wave ﬁeld rotation. Although the rotation we measure is quite small,
we believe this eﬀect to be suﬃcient to accentuate the globally negative trend observed in Figure
11.

A.3 Taylor Hypothesis

Another problem comes from the connection between frequency and wavenumber space, for which
the Taylor hypothesis was invoked at the beginning. The dispersionless approximation remains
valid up to about 0.5 Hz. Above this limit, the dispersion becomes positive and hence the resonance
conditions (equations (3)-(5)) are altered. The ﬁnite frequency resolution of the wavelets can easily
accommodate such small detunings in the resonance conditions.

A.4 Validity of the Model

The weakest point of our approach is the diﬃculty in justifying the validity of a low-order model
in a deﬁnite way. A quadratically nonlinear model suﬃces for describing the main features of
the wave ﬁeld (section 7), but Figure 9 reminds us that cubic interactions cannot be neglected.
Although we are conﬁdent in the conclusions drawn from our second-order model, one should keep
in mind that the results remain approximate as long as cubic and possibly even higher-order eﬀects
are not taken into account.

A.5 Calibration of the Probes

It is essential that the two probes (the magnetometers here) be properly calibrated and have the
same instrumental transfer function for our analysis to be meaningful. Although this is not a
problem for the frequency range we are considering, it may exclude diagnostics that have either
an unreliable calibration or a nonlinear response.

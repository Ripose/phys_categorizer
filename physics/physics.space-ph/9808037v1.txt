We extend the recently developed non-gaussian ther-
modynamic formalism [1] of a (presumably strongly tur-
bulent) non-Markovian medium to its most general form
that allows for the formulation of a consistent thermo-
dynamic theory. All thermodynamic functions, includ-
ing the deﬁnition of the temperature, are shown to be
meaningful. The thermodynamic potential from which
all relevant physical information in equilibrium can be
extracted, is deﬁned consistently. The most important
ﬁndings are the following two: (1) The temperature is
deﬁned exactly in the same way as in classical statistical
mechanics as the derivative of the energy with respect to
the entropy at constant volume. (2) Observables are de-
ﬁned in the same way as in Boltzmannian statistics as the
linear averages of the new equilibrium distribution func-
tion. This lets us conclude that the new state is a real
thermodynamic equilibrium in systems capable of strong
turbulence with the new distribution function replacing
the Boltzmann distribution in such systems. We discuss
the ideal gas, ﬁnd the equation of state, and derive the
speciﬁc heat and adiabatic exponent for such a gas. We
also derive the new Gibbsian distribution of states. Fi-
nally we discuss the physical reasons for the development
of such states and the observable properties of the new
distribution function.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a recent paper [1] we developed the kinetic theory of
a collisionless (presumably non-Markovian) equilibrium
state of a system of N particles undergoing strongly tur-
bulent interactions. Our motivation was to investigate
what kind of statistical mechanics described an equilib-
rium state of fully developed stationary turbulence, if
it existed at all. Evidence of the possibility of such a
description comes from observations of L´evy ﬂights and
started in the twentieth of this century when Richardson
found his turbulent spectral law that was fundamentally
diﬀerent from Kolmogorov’s law of ordinary spectral be-
haviour in turbulence (for a review of the history see,
e.g., [2]).

There had been earlier attempts to construct other
than Maxwell-Boltzmann probability distributions al-

ready in the past century and continued until today,
mostly as attempts to describe the thermodynamics of
extreme situations [3]. These attempts culminated in a
purely mathematical extension of Boltzmann’s deﬁni-
tion of entropy by R´enyi [4,5]. These extensions, though
widely used in chaotic dynamics in order to infer about
multi-fractal behaviour, have not been given any physi-
cal justiﬁcation yet. A certain mathematical simpliﬁca-
tion of R´enyi’s original proposal has subsequently been
suggested [6] that seemed to have applicability to some
range of physical problems. In particular, some kind of
thermodynamics was constructed (for the most lucid pre-
sentation see, e.g., [7]). However, this theory refers to an
unusual prescription of constructing physical observables
that is not in agreement with conventional physics.

Our basic assumption was that the stationary turbu-
lence we were going to describe was not describable by
weak turbulence theory. This assumption implied that
any equilibrium state the system might have achieved
could not be constructed by the means of perturbation
technique, i.e. no small expansion parameter exists. Sys-
tems of this kind are subject to non-perturbation tech-
niques. In some of those systems the transition from the
original state towards turbulence proceeds through crit-
icality. Such systems are critical and must be treated
by renormalisation group methods (cf., e.g., [8,9]). We
did not explicate about this point but instead asked for
the properties of the corresponding equilibria, propos-
ing that the system had actually settled into a critical
and turbulent intermediate equilibrium. We found that
these equilibrium states were describable by a new non-
Boltzmannian collision integral

is the correlation functional of the one-particle distribu-
tion functions f after (primed) and before (unprimed)
the interaction. GT[12] itself was found to be the prod-
uct of functionals g[f ] each depending on the distribution
function of one family of particles only. (The index T in-
dicates that the systems are in a state of about stationary
turbulence.) The turbulent state in that they are found
is reached on passing through critical points after having
entered a highly nonlinear phase. The transition to the

1

turbulence is not known in detail, but it can be assumed
that during the critical phase the systems evolves into
all scales such that the scales cannot be separated any-
more. It becomes essentially scale-invariant, and any per-
turbation theory breaks down when all scales are highly
correlated. In [1] it had been demonstrated that the func-
tionals g[f ] actually consist of inﬁnite products of corre-
lations suggesting that this interpretation is close to the
truth.

The breakdown of perturbation theory in the scale-
invariant state suggests that a microscopic approach to
the problem will have to refer to renormalization group
techniques. We have shown in [1], however, that it is
possible to describe the stationary equilibrium state of
the system without the need to develop the microscopic
phase-transition theory in detail by the methods of sta-
tistical mechanics. This has been done in close analogy to
Boltzmann’s kinetic theoretical approach. Detailed bal-
ance then requires that

ln g[f ] =

β(ǫp

µ)

−

−

where ǫp = p2/2m is the energy of a particle of momen-
tum p and mass m, and β, µ are two arbitrary constants
(playing the role of Lagrangean multipliers) which have
been suggested [1] to correspond to the kinetic temper-
ature and chemical potential of the system, respectively.
Below this suggestion will be proved in full strength.

If the system is described by Equation (1) and is in
the assumed highly nonlinear multi-scale turbulent equi-
librium, then one can introduce [1] a control parameter
κ such that

lim
κ→∞

g[f (κ, ǫp)]

fB(ǫp)

→

(4)

reproduces the Boltzmann distribution function fB, and
GT becomes the ordinary Boltzmann collision functional.
In [1] a particular functional g[f ] was found and it was
demonstrated that this functional actually described a
thermal equilibrium state nicely satisfying an H-theorem
and permitting for a new expression for the turbulent en-
tropy
S T. One should note that this new mathematical
expression for the entropy does not attach any new phys-
ical interpretation to the entropy. As in the Boltzmann
case, entropy describes the amount of irreversible disor-
der in the system. The new expression for the entropy
merely means that in the turbulent scale-invariant state
of the system the increase of disorder is calculated in a
diﬀerent way than in the conventional Boltzmann state.

II. GENERALISATION

We now generalise the functional g[f ] to its most general
form

g[f (κ, ǫp)] = exp

R, and ℓ is an arbitrary ﬁxed real num-
where
ber (R is the space of real numbers). The advantage of
introducing ℓ will become clear below. It is then easy to
demonstrate that the condition (4) is satisﬁed for any
arbitrary ﬁxed ℓ

=

The equilibrium distribution function f (κ, ǫp) can be
constructed using the two equations (3) and (5). The
most general distribution function is found to be

(6)

Clearly, it is a function of particle momentum p through
the particle energy ǫp = p2/2m and of the two param-
eters, κ and ℓ, respectively. It is then easy to show in
parallel to [1] that fℓ satisﬁes the following new gener-
alised turbulent entropy relation referred to in the above
discussion:

(3)

S T,ℓ =

−

kBV

Z

d3p
h3 fℓ(ǫp, κ) ln g[fℓ(ǫp, κ)].

(7)

This entropy is concave and moreover is super-additive,
meaning that the entropy of two independent systems
is larger than the sum of the individual entropies of the
two systems, an interesting property of such states. (Note
that, in accord with physical intuition and requirement,
S T,ℓ can never become sub-additive. Entropy in a single
closed system or in a collection of closed systems will al-
ways grow as disorder cannot be extinguished by adding
other disorder.) That this is true can be shown along
the same lines as in [1], for the introduction of the ﬁxed
number ℓ does not introduce any change in the analysis.
Hence, fℓ is an actual thermodynamic equilibrium distri-
bution that replaces the Boltzmann distribution fB under
κ-conditions. All the discussion of [1] can be applied to
it.

In the following we develop the corresponding thermo-
dynamics and show that it requires the choice ℓ = 1.
Therefore, the correct thermodynamic equilibrium one-
particle distribution function of the κ-gas is given by

f (ǫp, κ) =

where, for convenience, we suppressed the index ℓ = 1.

III. THERMODYNAMIC RELATIONS

In this section we deﬁne the basic thermodynamic func-
tions and demonstrate that a κ-gas is a system that
though behaving in a special way is nevertheless in com-
plete accord with the fundamental thermodynamic rela-
tions.

A. Thermodynamic Potentials

E =

(βF T)

∂
∂β

All macroscopic thermodynamic information about a sys-
tem in contact with the external world is contained in the
thermodynamic potential
(β, V, µ) which is a function
Q
of the temperature variable β, the volume of the system,
V , and the chemical potential µ (or particle number N ).
We deﬁne

QT(β, V, µ) of the κ-gas by

(9)

Since we assume that thermodynamics should provide a
valid description of the macrostate of the κ-gas in order
to be in accord with conventional physics, the relation
between the thermodynamic potential and other ther-
modynamic functions is given by

QT = FT −

µN.

(10)

Here FT is the Helmholtz free energy of the κ-gas, and
QT is the diﬀerence between F and the product of the av-
erage particle number and the chemical potential. Hence
the free energy is given by

FT =

We now show that this deﬁnition is consistent with the
Boltzmann limit. Indeed, taking the limit κ
in the
integral we immediately ﬁnd that

F =

d3p

which coincides with the Boltzmann-Helmholtz free en-
ergy. Moreover, this expression identiﬁes µ with the
chemical potential, and β = 1/kBT with the inverse ki-
netic temperature. The latter expression will be proved
explicitly and in full generality for arbitrary κ below.

B. Average Energy and Number Density

In conventional statistical mechanics, the total mean en-
ergy E is calculated from the Helmholtz free energy in
the following way:

(15)

Note that the second part of this equation is just the
correct physical deﬁnition of the average energy of the
system as the integral over phase space of the distribution
function, Equation (8), as is required by the commonly
used deﬁnition of an observable in statistical mechanics
and kinetic theory. In this respect, our theory is thus
consistent with common statistical physics and kinetic
theory. It does not require any diﬀerent kind of averaging
in order to calculate the observables as the physically
relevant quantities. This implies that this theory is also
in accord with the fundamental kinetic BBGKY theory
(cf., e.g., [12], chp. 2).

In order to be consistent with the previous sections,
Equation (15 suggest that we must identify ℓ = 1, which
justiﬁes our previous choice for ℓ. It would of course be
possible to choose any arbitrary ℓ in the deﬁnition of
Q
and to adjust the exponent of f appropriately, but such
an action would introduce some unnecessary arbitrariness
that would result in a simple re-scaling of κ.

The average particle number N is then given as the ze-
roth order moment of the distribution function f (ǫp, κ).
This can be shown to be the negative of the partial
derivative of the above thermodynamic potential

On the other hand, it must be required that the chemical
potential of the κ-gas is the partial derivative of the free
energy FT with respect to the average particle number

µ = (∂FT/∂N )βV .

(18)

In the new thermodynamics we replace F with F T to
obtain

This equation is conventionally used to express µ through
N .

C. Entropy

In order to ﬁnd the entropy relation, we form the
following derivative of the thermodynamic potential
kB(∂

QT/∂β−1)V µ. It can be shown that this derivative

when replacing the distribution function inside the inte-
gral with Equation (8) and using the above derived rep-
resentations for the average energy (15), particle number
(16), and the thermodynamic potential (9).

Clearly this entropy expression has a structure diﬀer-
ent from the ordinary Boltzmann deﬁnition. It contains
the logarithm of the correlation functional g[f ] in place
of the logarithm of the distribution function itself. This
fact implies that in the κ-state of the gas it is the cor-
relations that contribute most to the entropy. While in
the ﬁnal state of the system when the interactions be-
come purely stochastic and the gas settles into its ther-
fB, and the entropy assumes its classical
mal death, g
→
representation.

D. Consequence I: Deﬁnition of Temperature

As an important application of the above deﬁnition of the
entropy
S T of the κ-gas we now derive the expression for
the thermodynamic temperature. From classical thermo-
dynamics it is known that the only consistent deﬁnition
of the temperature is given in the form of a derivative of
the entropy:

1
T

=

∂
S
∂E

(cid:18)

(cid:19)V µ

.

When we use the expression (8) for the distribution func-
tion in the deﬁnition of the entropy (20) we recover that

S T = kBβ (E

−

µN ),

which is nothing else thatn a rearranged version of (19).
Then taking the partial derivative with respect to the av-
erage energy E we immediately identify the temperature
T as in conventional thermodynamics with the inverse of
the Lagrangean multiplier β

(21)

(22)

4

1
β

= kBT.

(23)

This very important relation proves that the tempera-
ture T of the κ-gas is deﬁned exactly in the same manner
as the temperature of the classical Boltzmann gas. In this
way it renders all other deﬁnitions of the temperature of
the κ-gas used in the literature invalid. Those deﬁnitions
still contained dependencies on κ (cf., e.g., [13–16] and
elsewhere). These κ-dependencies turn out to be unphys-
ical. They are the result of a naiv use of the so-called ex-
perimentally determined ‘κ-distributions’ in calculating
a formal expression for the temperature. The physically
correct distribution function Equation (8) resembles the
κ-distribution, but it contains the non-vanishing chemi-
cal potential. It is only this complete distribution func-
tion that leads to a correct thermodynamics, with the
temperature T being deﬁned as a physical quantity by
its thermodynamic deﬁnition, Equations (21) and (23).
The temperature in this sense is a measure of the state
of the system. It is a parameter that characterises the
gas. It is not a measure of the mean energy. Only in the
Boltzmann gas the two, mean energy and temperature,
measured in energy units, are related in a simple way.
Below we are going to derive the relation valid in the
κ-gas.

The above derivation of the temperature thus justiﬁes
the use of the constant β as the unambiguous and only
measure of the thermodynamic temperature of any (tur-
bulent) κ-system and shows that in such a system the
above deﬁnition of the entropy consistently replaces the
Boltzmann deﬁnition.

E. Consequence II: Equation of State

In order to complete the set of thermodynamic relations
we may now construct the equation of state taking the
partial derivative of
QT with respect to the volume V .
This procedure yields the pressure

(24)

Rewriting this expression with the help of Equation (9)
we ﬁnd the following important relation

(25)

P V =

−QT(β, V, µ).
This is the fundamental equation of state of a (turbulent)
κ-gas. It shows that such gases possess complicated equa-
tions of state. Such behaviour has been expected from the
very beginning, because the presence of the long-range
correlations should become manifest in the average prop-
erties of the gas as well. Even an ideal κ-gas turns out to

have a non-simple equation of state, as will be demon-
strated below.

The remaining ﬁrst and second order thermodynamic
relations can all be obtained from the previous relations
and will not be given here.

IV. REVIEW OF IDEAL κ-GAS PROPERTIES

In our previous paper [1] we derived some of the relations
for an ideal gas. Here, because of the precise deﬁnition of
the thermodynamic potential and the above consistency
proof of the thermodynamic relations we can consider-
ably simplify the expressions given before. Moreover, the
formulas given below correct them for thermodynamic
consistency.

A. Chemical Potential

We start with the average particle number N of an ideal
κ-gas. This number is given as the phase-space integral
over the ideal gas distribution function f (ǫp, κ) Equation

It is assumed throughout thermodynamics that the av-
erage number density n = N/V would be known. Hence,
Equation (26) is basically an equation for the chemical
potential µ of the ideal κ-gas. Inverting (26) and intro-
ducing the ‘quantum κ-density’

The right-hand side of this expression is always positive,
and hence either the chemical potential is negative µ < 0
or βµ/κ < 1. It is not too diﬃcult to demonstrate [1]
that in the limit κ
this expression reproduces the
classical chemical potential of an ideal gas [10] with nq =
(2πm/h2β)3/2 the ‘quantum density’ of the classical gas.

B. Mean Energy

Also, carrying out the integration in Equation (15), the
average energy of the ideal κ-gas follows as

With the above identiﬁcation of β = 1/kBT one imme-
reproduces the
diately realises that the limit κ

for the energy per particle. As is obvious from Equation
(29), in the κ-gas this last relation between the mean en-
ergy and the temperature becomes much more involved.
Moreover, it is also obvious that the above deﬁnition of
the energy requires that

(30)

(31)

a condition that is consistent with a similar one derived
in our previous publication [1].

C. Ideal Gas Equation of State

We now calculate the pressure of the ideal κ-gas in
order to determine its equation of state. From Equation
(25) we obtain

This equation of state becomes the ordinary ideal gas
equation of state P V = N kBT only in the Boltzmann
limit κ
. The ideal κ-gas behaves diﬀerently, pos-
sessing a much more complicate equation of state. This
seems reasonable because, as mentioned above, the fact
that the κ-gas is a highly correlated many-body system,
which we assume is in an evolved turbulent state, must
in the ﬁrst place become obvious in its equation of state.
Such a gas should exhibit a behaviour that diﬀerens from
that of an ordinary laminar ideal gas. Nevertheless, how-
ever, is is then both surprising and satisfactory that, com-
paring Equations (29) and (32), one recovers the basic
thermodynamic relation between the pressure and aver-
age energy,

P V =

E,

2
3

(33)

as is valid also in ordinary ideal gases. The unbroken va-
lidity of this relation even in the κ-gas is interesting and
is an important ﬁnding. Its physical meaning is that it
relates the mean energy in a simple geometrical way to

5

the pressure of the κ-gas. This retains the physical in-
terpretation that the pressure is the geometrical eﬀect of
the average motion of the constituents of the gas. The
temperature assumes quite a diﬀerent meaning then as
an independent parameter measuring the irreversibility
of the system in place of its thermal mean energy. The
average energy of the κ-gas is thus not a simple measure
of the temperature T of the κ-gas. The average energy
per particle E/N in a κ-gas is not anymore a simple frac-
tion of the kinetic temperature. Only in the Boltzmann
gas become both, mean energy and temperature, simple
equivalents.

Inspection of this equation suggests that in a dilute κ-

to maximum correlation (at κ

become large. These are two further distinctions between
ordinary and κ-gases, respectively.

The most interesting quantity is, however, the index

However, as expected, CV in the κ-gas is not a constant
(or otherwise an extensive function of the particle num-
ber). It depends on both, density and temperature. This
complication suggests that the adiabatic exponent γκ of
the κ-gas will as well not be a simple constant, as is the
case for the ideal Boltzmann gas.

Calculation of the speciﬁc heat CP at constant pressure
turns out to be more involved. We can, however, take
advantage of the general thermodynamic formula

relating CP and CV (cf., e.g., [10]). This is possible be-
cause we have already demonstrated that the thermody-
namics of the κ-gas is formally identical with that of the
ordinary Boltzmann gas.

Making extensive use of the equations of state (32),
energy (29), and speciﬁc heat at constant volume (35)
we obtain for the diﬀerence (37) of the two speciﬁc heats

ically impossible, and is a result of using the minimum
value for κ, and n = nq at the same time. This discussion
shows, however, that for suﬃciently high densities and
small κ the adiabatic index becomes small. Investigation
of these cases requires the development of the quantum
theoretical extension of the present theory. This will be
given elsewhere [11].

The above result on the reduction of the adiabatic in-
dex is exciting. Reduction of γ physically implies that the
number of degrees of freedom increases. Remember that,
classically, γ is a measure of the internal freedom of the
system and is microscopically related to the degrees d of
freedom by

γ = (d + 2)/d.

, the
Equation (43) then suggests that for κmin < κ <

2, the
number d increases by a large amount. For d
1. In the κ-
index γ quickly approaches the value γ
gas, γκ may not necessarily be related to d in the same
simple way (45) as in the classical gas. It is possible that
the relation between γκ and d will be more involved. In
order to obtain the actual dependence, one must develop
the microscopic theory of the interactions in a multi-scale
medium which is outside our present reaches. Neverthe-
less, the decrease in γ provides a strong argument for the
validity of the initial assumption underlying our theory.
This assumption was that the κ-gas is in a multi-scale
state with an enormously large number of degrees of free-
dom, and that these scales are all correlated in a way as is
expected for fully developed turbulence. Media like this
are believed to be scale-invariant and should microscop-
ically be treated by renormalisation-group methods [9].

E. Isentropic Process

With the adiabatic index at hand we can investigate the
isentropic (adiabatic) evolution of the κ-gas. To this end
we need the explicit expression for the ideal gas entropy

(46)

Isentropic processes leave the entropy constant. To ﬁrst
approximation this requires that

V T 3/2 = const,

(47)

a condition that is identical to the condition for adia-
baticity in the thermodynamics of ordinary gases (cf.,
e.g., [17]). For κ-gases, the second term in the curly brack-
ets in Equation (46) seems to introduce a further com-
plication. However, in the particular case when the term

in the square brackets on the right-hand side of Equa-
tion (46) is large, we still arrive at the surprising result
that the condition Equation (47) is still exactly satisﬁed.
Hence, only the intermediate regime when

nqκ

−

(48)

the adiabatic relation between volume and temperature
changes. This practical independence of the condition of
isentropy on the value of kappa is a purely geometrical
eﬀect that tells that a suﬃciently fast expansion of any
medium should cause cooling. It is only reasonable that
this behaviour does not halt in front of turbulent or scale-
invariant systems. With the help of (47) the two remain-
ing isentropic relations are obtained from the equation of
state as

−5/2 = const,
P T
P V 5/3 = const.

(49)
(50)

It is remarkable that these conditions exactly coincide
with those for the isentropic processes in a classical Boltz-
mann gas. We thus learn from this agreement that isen-
tropy results in simple geometric behaviour of both Boltz-
mann and κ-gases. Since the thermodynamic diﬀerential
equations remain valid for the κ-gas, they can in prin-
ciple be used to express these exponents through γκ. In
a κ-gas, however, the ratio of speciﬁc heat has no direct
relation to the isentropic processes as is the case in an
ordinary ideal gas.

F. Volume Coeﬃcients

coeﬃcients of thermal expansion and compressibility, re-
spectively. The ﬁrst is given by the well-know formula

It can be easily calculated from the equation of state

This completes our account of the stationary properties
of the ideal κ-gas.

V. FLUCTUATIONS

Because it is a system in thermal equilibrium the κ-gas
is capable of thermal ﬂuctuations as well. Such ﬂuctua-
tions are known to be the root-mean-square amplitudes
of the oscillations of the various macroscopic quantities
around the thermal equilibrium state. Independent of the
very particular form of the equilibrium distribution func-
tion the ﬂuctuation amplitudes average out when aver-
aged over suﬃciently long times or spatial scales. Under
κ-conditions this restriction poses caution on the deﬁ-
nition of ﬂuctuations. Times can be no longer than the
inverse binary collision time as it is our philosophy that
the collisionless turbulent scale-invariant state refers to
times shorter than the binary collision time 1/νc (cf., [1]).
Hence, very slow oscillations may not average out even
linearly and may survive the entire scale-invariant regime
until they enter the binary collisional state when they be-
come ultimately depleted. Moreover, the assumption of
scale-invariance (or self-similarity) also implies that very
long oscillations may survive. With these restrictions in
mind the rms ﬂuctuation amplitude of a quantity A is
deﬁned in the ordinary way as

2
rms =
∆A
i

(56)

where the average is understood as the ensemble aver-
age or expectation value. Our discussion presented in the
previous sections has shown that calculating expectation
values by linear averaging over the distribution function
is the appropriate way to stay in accord with the require-
ment of being able to deﬁne a consistent thermodynamic
theory in the κ-regime of the evolution of the system.
Here we are interested in providing the expressions for
the most fundamental rms ﬂuctuation amplitudes.

A. Particle Number Fluctuations

The particle number ﬂuctuation cannot be calculated di-
rectly from the zeroth order moment of the distribution

8

(57)

(58)

The second-order derivative of the pressure on the right-
hand side of this equation can be shown [10] to be equiv-

The rms number ﬂuctuation increases with N while the
relative ﬂuctuation in particle number decreases as N in-
creases. Note that if we would have used the average ex-
pressions to calculate the number ﬂuctuation, we would
have found a zero ﬂuctuation in number. Hence the eﬀect
is small in a dilute gas, as it should be. Moreover, com-
paring the ﬂuctuation with the compressibility (55) one
observes that the number ﬂuctuation is proportional to
KT κ as has been expected since this is a particular case
of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem holding for small
ﬂuctuations (cf., e.g., [18], chpt. 8).

B. Energy Fluctuations

It is more interesting to determine the ﬂuctuation of
the mean energy. It is most convenient to simply calcu-
late the two expectation values in Equation (56) with
E and to take their diﬀerence. It is, however, much

the energy ﬂuctuation

The rms ﬂuctuation amplitude is proportional to the
thermal energy kBT and increases as the root of the
particle number. Its absolute value also increases with
κ approaching κmin. The smaller κ the higher is the ab-
solute level of the ﬂuctuations in energy. On the other

hand, when dividing the rms amplitude by the mean en-
ergy Equation (29) one ﬁnds that at the same time the
relative energy ﬂuctuation

decreases because the mean energy increases faster than
the ﬂuctuation. This can be easily understood as the in-
creasing eﬀect of storage of energy in the high-energy
tail of the distribution near κmin. The relative amount
of energy stored in the ﬂuctuations produced by the tail
becomes less than the energy itself. Nevertheless, though
the energy diverges faster than the ﬂuctuation energy,
the gas contains ﬂuctuations of large amplitude that is
an expression of its turbulent nature and the appearance
of many scales.

VI. PROPERTIES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM
DISTRIBUTION

In this section we return to the equilibrium distribu-
tion function f (ǫp, κ) and investigate its most obvious
properties. Because distribution functions nowadays have
become measurable quantities (though not observables
in the strict physical sense) their shape and behaviour
provide a direct link to the physical properties of the
medium. Examples of so-called κ-distributions observed
in space plasmas have been given continuously for about
thirty years (cf., [19–23]), with the most extended ob-
servations being obtained in the Earth’s magnetospheric
tail [21,22]. Similar distributions are believed to be re-
lated to L´evy ﬂight dynamics [2] and have been used in
an attempt to interpret cross-ﬁeld diﬀusion [24]. But the
physics of such κ-distributions has not been understood
for a long time. Attempts of their explanation trace back
to various types of solutions of the Fokker-Planck equa-
tion for particular interactions [25–27]. The general ther-
modynamic theory developed in [1] and in the present pa-
per is the ﬁrst consistent physical theory of these families
of distribution functions, aside from another approximate
attempt [28] that was based on so-called non-extensive
thermodynamics [6].

In the following we discuss the information that can
be extracted from observation of generalised-Lorentzian
distribution functions.

A. Velocity Distribution

The distribution function f (ǫp, κ) Equation 8 has been
given in terms of the particle momentum p. It belongs to
the family of generalized-Lorentzian functions. Distribu-
tion functions like this one possess the property that not
all inﬁnitely many moments of the distribution can exist.

κ > (r + 1)/2.

(63)

For the mean energy to be a physically measurable quan-
tity this expression sets the limit for κ > 3/2. At the
current state it is diﬃcult to discuss what will happen to
the higher moments and in which way the theory can be
‘renormalised’ if at all. Probably, the high energy tails
will break the scale-invariance at some stage and will
close the system of moments by self-limitation of the tail
of the distribution function. The more important require-
ment here is that f (ǫp, κ) is a probability distribution
function and must therefore be positive and real. This
property renders

βµ/κ < 1,

ǫp <

0

≤

∞

a condition that has been shown to be satisﬁed for ideal
gases and in the absence of external potential ﬁelds. Oth-
erwise one requires that

(64)

(65)

ǫp > ˜µ

κ/β > 0,

−

where ˜µ is the total chemical potential including the ex-
ternal potential ﬁeld. In the second case, a certain range
of low particle energies (or low particle velocities) is not
covered by the distribution. This implies that for suf-
ﬁciently large positive total chemical potentials the mo-
ment integrals may become non-analytic. Such cases pro-
vide enormous diﬃculties for physical interpretation. In
the following we will exclude this case from discussion.

In terms of the velocity v of the particles the isotropic

velocity distribution function reads

allowing for the determination of β = 1/kBT , i.e. the
determination of the temperature.

A general important property of the (isotropic) veloc-
ity distribution is that the value 4πp2f (p, κ) is the prob-
ability of ﬁnding any particles in the intervall of momen-
tum [p, p + dp]. The maximum of this expression thus
deﬁned the most probable velocity ¯v (momentum) of the
particles. This velocity is given by

On the other hand, the rms speed is deﬁned as

and, at high energies, becomes power-law and drops as
ǫκ+1/2. Again, from its asymptotic behaviour one deter-
mines κ, while the value of the most probable energy is
a measure of βµ. One also notes that the most proba-
ble energy increases with temperature T . The maximum
value of the distribution itself is

The most probable speed is smaller than the rms veloc-
ity. The value of these expressions is mainly that mea-
surement of both velocities provides an independent pos-
sibility to determine the value of κ and, subsequently, the
value of the thermodynamic temperature T .

B. Energy Distribution

We brieﬂy turn to a discussion of the energy distribution
as this in practice is sometimes more important than the
velocity distribution itself. Similar to the Boltzmann case
the energy distribution is deﬁned as

f (ǫ, κ) = ǫ1/2f (v, κ).

At small particle energies ǫ it increases as f

as in an ordinary gas as well. Depending on the sign of the
external potential this may have enormous consequences
on the analyticity of the distribution function, as has
been mentioned in the introduction to this section. As
long as this analyticity is guarantied, further integration
of the distribution function provides no diﬃculties.

As for a ﬁrst and simple application we calculate the
density of an electron plasma immersed into an external
electric ﬁeld. In this case the average external density in
eφ in Equation
the absence of the ﬁeld is n0, and φ
(78) is understood as the potential energy of the electron
in the electric potential ﬁeld φ. Carrying out the integra-
tion of the zeroth order moment of 78 one ﬁnds for the
electron density

found, e.g., for gases embedded in an external gravita-
g (the so-called barometric

law). In order to obtain the corresponding expression one
replaces eφ/kBT
mgH/kBT , where H is the height
above level H = 0, where n(H = 0) = n0. The interest-
ing point about both these density distributions is that,
in a κ-gas, the density reacts algebraically to the pres-
ence of the external potential. For the barometric case
this implies that it decays less than exponentially.

→ −

A simple application of the density formula Equation
(80) is to the calculation of the screening distance of
an ion in a quasineutral κ-plasma, the so-called Debye
length. This length may be found, expanding the right-
hand side of Equation (80) for small potentials and us-
ing Poisson’s law. For illustration we show only the one-
dimensional case. Then, from

This value always exceeds the Boltzmann-Debye length.
Intuitively this eﬀect is clear and very satisfactory is as
far as one may easily convince oneself that the presence
of an excess of electrons in the tail of the distribution
function over the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution will
worsen the conditions for screening. The faster electrons
are less aﬀected by the potential of the test ion and,
hence, this potential will reach farther out into space.
Actually, at the absolute limiting value κmin = 3/2 the
ratio of the two Debye-lengths becomes practically inﬁ-
nite,

(84)

The eﬀect of such large screening lengths on the be-
haviour of κ-plasmas is of considerable interest. It may
possibly support electric ﬁelds in plasmas stronger than
ordinarily expected to exist. Also, because the level
of electron thermal ﬂuctuations in Langmuir waves is
proportional to 1/n0λ3
D,κ, Langmuir ﬂuctuations in κ-
plasmas should be strongly reduced. It may be speculated
that such plasmas would be even less collisional and ex-
hibit lower levels of spontaneous emission as well as lower
levels of thermal radiation from the plasma. However, no
ﬁrm conclusion can be drawn at this level of investigation
as long as the microscopic processes acting in κ-plasmas
have not been clariﬁed.

D. Relativistic Distribution

In this last subsection we brieﬂy investigate the relativis-
tic version of the Loorentzian distribution function. In
relativistic gases, ǫp = mγrelc2, with γrel the relativistic
Gamma-factor. The phase space volume element trans-
forms as

VII. DISCRETE ENERGY LEVELS: GIBBSIAN
DISTRIBUTION

The theory developed in [1] and explicated in the former
sections of this paper assumes that the energy levels in
the κ-gas are continuously distributed. If, on the other
hand, the energy levels are discrete, the formalism must
be replaced by a discrete formalism. This can be achieved
by replacing the integrals in the most fundamental for-
mulas by sums over the discrete states of the system.
The most important replacement is to be done in the
thermodynamic potential
of Equation (9). When sum-
ming over discrete states, the volume factor V disappears,
and the restriction on momentum space volume elements
contained in the diﬀerential d3p/h3 becomes unnecessary.
Thus, the discrete partition function becomes

Here Er is the r-th discrete energy level, and the sum-
mation is over all dynamically possible levels Er. In a
κ-system, this expression replaces (up to an classically
unimportant factor containing the chemical potential)
the classical (Gibbsian) partition function

by forming the limit value for κ

above mentioned factor
terwards drops out by simple normalisation in the clas-
sical case, while it is important to be retained in the
κ-system.) The partition function (93) contains all the
information about the equilibrium state of the κ-system.
In analogy to our derivation of the distribution function
it also suggests that the most probable Gibbs distribution
of discrete states can be written as

an expression that is of similar though not identical form
as the one given in [6]. All thermodynamic relations ap-
QT. It is important to note that there is no simple
ply to
probabilistic way of distributing N particles on arbitrary
sates that would reproduce the above Lorentz-Gibbsian
probability distribution. The occupation number wr is

not a simple most probable probability distribution in
the ordinary meaning of the word. It cannot be achieved
at by throwing the dice. Though it is obvious that it
maximises
S T thereby leading to the state of maximum
disorder, this does not mean that this state is achieved
in a simple probabilistic way. There are non-obvious un-
derlying processes that speed up this distribution. These
processes will have to be investigated in future.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we extended our initial theory of the
statistical mechanics of the κ-state to develop the ther-
modynamics of such a state. We found that it is indeed
possible and in asymptotic agreement with classical sta-
tistical mechanics to construct the full thermodynamics
of the κ-state. It was possible to deﬁne the thermody-
QT that contains all the physics of the
namic potential
equilibrium state. One of the most important ﬁndings
was that the deﬁnition of temperature can be retained in
its full validity also in the κ-state of a system. Another
not less important conclusion was that the deﬁnition of
observables in the κ-state is exactly the same as in clas-
sical statistical mechanics. This fact is most satisfactory
because it does not violate physical intuition. Moreover,
the entropy can only grow in states of the kind corre-
sponding to κ-states. This is satisfactory as well: addi-
tion of disorder does not diminish disorder, it can only
increase it. There is no process in closed systems, inde-
pendent on their internal dynamics that could minimise
entropy. To this end one must do external work on the
system. The claim that instability would generate order
in a closed system and reduce entropy is misleading. En-
tropy can only be reduced locally on the expense of en-
tropy increase in other locations in the system. Instability
can do nothing else but redistribute free energy until it
makes it available to other dissipative processes.

A large number of questions has been left open for
future investigation. The most important is not that
concerning the reality of processes like the once dis-
cussed here. Observation of L´evy ﬂights and increasing
frequency of measurement of so-called ‘κ-distributions’
(after those we have modelled our distribution function
by the use of the control parameter κ) in large collision-
less systems like the near-Earth space environment pro-
vide suﬃcient justiﬁcation for an expedition into basic
physics. But the question remains of what is the phys-
ical relevance of the index κ? In an interesting paper
[25], Hasegawa and co-workers found a similar distribu-
tion function solving a Fokker-Planck equation under the
assumption of a very particular weakly turbulent inter-
action in a plasma. There, κ turned out to depend on the
dispersion of plasma waves.

A solution of this kind may remain a particular case
of weak turbulence. It rather seems that the κ state of a

12

system refers to an intermediate strongly turbulent state
when the system has settled into quasi-equilibrium for
some time before binary collisions set on to destroy the
state and to dissipate the energy stored in the turbu-
lent motion, as has been argued in [1]. Equilibria usually
imply the dissipative destruction of the free energy. In κ-
equilibrium it seems that this is not necessarily the case.
But the observation that κ appears only in this inter-
mediate state, suggests that there must be discontinuous
transitions between the initial and the κ-state and pos-
sibly also to the Boltzmann regime.

Figure 1 schematically illustrates this behaviour of κ
for the same scenario as in [1]. In this ﬁgure we plot-
ted the value of κ−1. This value must be zero in the
respective linear and in the ﬁnal Boltzmann regimes, be-
cause these regimes are classical (κ
). In the tur-
bulent quasi-equilibrium state κ−1 suddenly assumes a
value between zero and 1/κmin (the ﬁgure shows the
marginal case κ = const = κmin). The sudden increase
from κ−1 = 0 to κ−1
= 0 is understood as a critical phase
transition. A possible non-critical transition is shown as
the dotted line in the non-linear violent relaxation regime
where our theory does not apply.

→ ∞

Physically spoken, there is no need for κ being con-
stant troughout the entire quasi-equilibrium. If κ changes
suﬃciently slowly compared to the length of this quasi-
equilibrium the equilibrium theory can still be applied.
There is reason to believe that such a situation is closer
to reality than κ = const. Dissipative non-collisional ir-
reversible processes will necessarily accompany the tur-
bulent state. Because the heating causes T to increase
with time, κ(T ) will itself become a function of time.
Two such cases have been included in Figure 1. In the
ﬁrst one (thin solid line), the ﬁnal critical phase transi-
tion does entirely disappear. κ(T ) tends to inﬁnity right
at the end of the intermediate stationary state. In the
second case (dotted line), κ remains ﬁnite towards the
end of the quasi-equilibrium, and another critical phase
transition is needed when suddenly binary collisions take
over. Which one of these cases will be realised, depends
on the properties of the system during its evolution. We
will have to develop the non-equilibrium thermodynam-
ics for κ-systems before these questions can be answered.
This goal in addition requires to solve the problem of
divergencies appearing in the higher moments of the dis-
tribution function.

FIG. 1. Schematic evolution of 1/κ for a diﬀerent cases.
The solid line refers to the model used in the present paper.
κ is zero At times t < tnl and t > tc = 1/nuc, respectively.
There are two critical transitions in this case where κ jumps
from zero to a ﬁnite value κ > κmin at these transitions (the
ﬁgure shows the marginal case κ = κmin). The dotted line
shows a possible Non critical transition where κ 6= 0 already
in the interval tl < t < tnl. Such a transition may avoid criti-
cality and would be describable by ordinary strong turbulence
theory (nonlinear wave-wave and wave-particle interactions).
In addition, κ can depend on time (or otherwise temperature
if accounting for transitional heating in turbulence. Then ei-
ther the cases of the dotted (retaining a late critical phase
transition) or thin solid lines (no ﬁnal critical transition) ap-
ply, respectively.

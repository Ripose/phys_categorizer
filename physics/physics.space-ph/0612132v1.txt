Propellantless propulsion in magnetic ﬁelds by partially shielded current

Luzi Bergamin∗, Dario Izzo†and Alexander Pinchook‡

I.

Introduction

Electrodynamic tethers have been studied intensively for propulsion and power generation
purposes in a number of diﬀerent scenarios.1 An electrodynamic tether exploits the magnetic
ﬁeld of a planet via the Lorentz force acting on it when the tether is transversed by a current.

In order for the concept to work the current ﬂow in the tether needs to be closed using the
plasma surrounding the satellite. This introduces stringent bounds on the available currents,
which must be compensated by making the tethers very long thus increasing the bare tether

surface. As an example we reference to the several kilometers long tether recently proposed
by Sanmartin and Lorenzini for the exploration of the Jupiter moons.2 The mission has been
later studied in greater detail by Sanmartin in cooperation with the Advanced Concepts
Team of ESA3 and revealed a number of design issues that need to be addressed and that
derive ultimately from these limitations. The need to rely on the plasma and the need for very

long tethers could be eliminated altogether if it was possible to close the circuit with a wire
rather than via the plasma. However, this seems to be ruled out, as the net electromagnetic

force acting on a closed wire immersed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld cannot yield a propulsive
force (a net angular momentum is still possible, though). In a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld
a net force in the direction of increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength is still encountered, which
may be used eﬀectively under laboratory conditions4 but appears to be hopeless for any
applications in space.

To circumvent this caveat, part of the current must be shielded from the magnetic ﬁeld
in which the satellite moves, which is indeed possible by means of a superconductor.5, 6 The
use of superconductors in space mission concepts is not too unusual. Superconductive coils
have been proposed for propulsion concepts,7, 8 advanced shielding devices9 and ﬂy-wheel
systems. The use of superconductors as a shield from the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld has

been suggested for diﬀerent reasons elsewhere.10, 11 Some recent advances in superconductive
wires manufacture12–15 has revived the hope that these concepts may actually be near to an
implementation in a space system. Though the current knowledge base from space experi-
ments with superconductors is yet rather limited, the actual results16–19 are very promising if
one considers the robustness to the space-environment of high-temperature superconductors

and the associated chill components.

In this paper we describe the basic functioning of an original device based on the use of
superconductors partially shielding a current on board of a satellite and therefore allowing for

a signiﬁcant net Lorentz force on a closed circuit. Depending on the exact conditions (char-
acteristics of the orbit) we describe several working modes of the device. Below geostationary

orbit it seems to be very promising in transforming, without the use of propellant, spacecraft
power into propulsion or spacecraft kinetic energy into power. Above geostationary orbit it
allows a propellantless and powerless propulsion mechanism.

II. Description of the Device

We consider a satellite in the orbit of a planet with a magnetic ﬁeld, for example the
Earth, Jupiter or Saturn. Putting a closed wire on board of the satellite in which a current I

ﬂows, this current will interact with the magnetic ﬁeld of the planet but it will fail to generate
a signiﬁcant net force on the spacecraft. By shielding a part of the wire from the magnetic

ﬁeld, a situation similar to an electrodynamic tether emerges and a net force is found that
can be used for propulsion or may simply generate power. This can be achieved by placing
those parts of the wire to be shielded into a superconductor having cylindrical geometry with
suﬃciently thick walls (see Willis20 for a study on the shielding capabilities of HTS hollow
cylinders). It is a well-known characteristic of superconductors that a magnetic ﬁeld cannot

penetrate them. Now a net force results on the unshielded part of the wire and in this way
on the satellite (cf. the schematic depiction in ﬁgure 1). As the satellite has to be equipped
with a superconductor, it is self-evident to build the wire with a superconducting material as

well. In this way the advantage over electrodynamic tethers, i.e. the larger currents available,
is maximized. Currents in superconductors can reach levels as high as 106 A/cm2,12–15 which
shrinks the total length of the wire to the order of 1m as will be shown below. Note that

the total energy change of the satellite, due to the applied force, is balanced by an opposite
change in the energy of the source of the magnetic ﬁeld: the plasma underneath the Earth

crust. In this sense our device, and so the electrodynamic tethers, are able to extract energy
from the rotation of a planet using its magnetic ﬁeld as a medium.

In the following we give a rough estimate of the eﬃciency of the device as a propulsion

system. We consider that the Earth magnetic ﬁeld is a dipole aligned with the Earth axis

may be useful to align the current perpendicular to the velocity and to the magnetic ﬁeld.

of rotation and we consider only satellite orbits with zero inclination.

A. Lorentz force and its implications

The total movable charge (electrons) in the wire with length l exposed to the magnetic ﬁeld
is called Q. For a given charge density ρe and wire cross-section A thus

Q = ρeAl .

(1)

(2)

There are two diﬀerent forces that can act onto the moving electrons: the ﬁrst one is due to
the satellite moving in a magnetic ﬁeld and called ~F1 (sometimes referred to as electromotive
force), the second one is due to the movement of the electrons inside the wire and is called
~F2. We start by investigating ~F2, which can be expressed as

~F2 = Q~ve ×

~B =

I~l

~B ,

−

×

where ~ve is the velocity of the electrons in the wire. By a suitable orientation of the device—
i.e. of the direction of the vector ~l—the force ~F2 can be aligned tangential to the trajectory
of the satellite and thus may change the semi-major axis of the orbit.

Though this explains the basic working principle of the device, the importance of the
force ~F1 should be recognized as well. Of course, ~F1 vanishes as a force acting on the whole
satellite, as the latter is neutral if charging eﬀects are disregarded. However, locally the

the velocity of the satellite becomes

moving in the magnetic ﬁeld, the second term the eﬀect of the co-rotational electric ﬁeld
~E =
~B which is due to the rotation of the core of the Earth (a conducting
plasma) inside the magnetic ﬁeld. The eﬀect of ~F1 is to accelerate or decelerate the electrons
thus creating the electromotive force (emf) also discussed by Cosmo and Lorenzini1 for the
electrodynamic tethers. In the ﬁrst case it will be used as a source of energy, in the second

×

case it must be counteracted by an electromagnetic potential. The fact that an opposite
force acts onto the ions in the wire is not of importance any more, as they do not contribute

to the ﬂowing current.

The shielding of the magnetic ﬁeld by a superconducting cylinder plays an important role
in our concept and thus we should look at this eﬀect a little bit more in detail. Certainly this

is not a problem for a superconductor at rest. However, our device is supposed to move inside
the magnetic ﬁeld and as explained above it is the eﬀect of this motion (viz. the Lorentz

force) that we want to use. Let us simplify for a moment the situation and disregard the
curvature of the motion of the satellite as well as the variations of the magnetic ﬁeld. Then a
homogeneous and static magnetic ﬁeld is encountered, wherein the satellite moves uniformly

in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld (we assume the idealized situation of ﬁgure
1). Now a Lorentz transformation can be applied in such a way that the device is at rest in

the new reference frame. Consider a situation where the device moves in the original frame
in the x-direction at a constant speed v and where the magnetic ﬁeld is simply ~B = (0, 0, B).

are obtained, which means that an electric ﬁeld parallel to the surface of the superconducting

shield is encountered, which accounts for the Lorentz force in the coordinate system denoted
by variables without primes. The eﬀect of this electric ﬁeld yields the force ~F1 and the

current inside the superconductor must be shielded therefrom, whereas the picture for the
emergence of ~F2 does not change. It is important to realize, that the superconductor shields
the eﬀect of this electric ﬁeld onto the wire as well. Indeed, the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the

surface of the superconductor and therefore induces surface currents. As the superconductor
has a ﬁnite length, this yields a non-trivial charge distribution at the surface of the supercon-

ductor that reaches a stable situation, when the electric ﬁeld is canceled exactly inside the
superconductor. In a more realistic situation, the electric ﬁeld might not be exactly parallel
to the surface of the superconductor. Nevertheless, only the compensation of the parallel

component is important, while the perpendicular remains unimportant.

B. Propulsion

Let us have a closer look at the forces that can be used for propulsion. We split the force
into radial and tangential part, where where ˆ~t is the direction perpendicular to ~r and ~ωe. In
our case the components of the force for ~F2 are

Which of the two components is relevant? As is obvious from Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) the device
can work eﬃciently only if the magnetic ﬁeld is almost perpendicular to the velocity and
thus (for a small perturbation force) almost perpendicular to ˆ~t. Thus we will consider, in this
Fr in contrast to a charged satellite (see Peck22 for a description
preliminary analysis, Ft ≫
of Lorentz Augmented Orbit) where Ft ≪

aﬀect the generality of the result obtained in this way. It is in fact one of the advantages
of this device over electrodynamic tethers that its orientation in space can be controlled.
If we aim at changing the semi-major axis of the spacecraft orbit (i.e. the orbit energy),
the optimal geometry would be to have the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to ~vs and ~ve and
to orient ~l so that the Lorentz force is parallel to ~vs. Still this is not always possible (we
cannot control the planet magnetic ﬁeld direction) and the mission designers will have to
use optimally the available thrusting direction to reach the mission goals, a very challenging
optimal control problem in itself.

In the following we will assume that ~ve is parallel to ~veﬀ

~B, which can always be
achieved by an appropriate rotation of the device. In this way the work performed by ~F1 on
the current is maximized. Furthermore the current represents the ﬂow of positive charges,
I =

ρeAve, and we assign a certain resistance R to the wire.

To calculate the power we gain or need due to ~F1 we assume a constant (or at least slowly
varying) value of the Lorentz force and in addition set the total length of the wire to 2l.

where α is the angle between ~veﬀ and ~B. The relation between the sign of P1 and the direction
of the force ~F2 is the same as in the case of a electrodynamic tether: below the geostationary
(or more exactly magnetostationary) orbit, P1 is negative if ~F2 acts as a propulsive force and
vice versa. When crossing the geostationary orbit, the term ~F1 in Eq. (3) (and therefore also
P1) changes sign as veﬀ becomes negative, while the term ~F2 in Eq. (2) does not. Therefore
in this region the device acts as a propellantless and powerless propulsion system. Here we
assumed a prograde orbit, in the case of a retrograde orbit the region of powerless propulsion

A. Drag compensation

A possible application is drag compensation for satellites on a (not too) low orbit. The
simplest model of a drag force is

where ρatm is the atmospheric density, A the area of the satellite vatm the relative velocity
of the satellite in the atmosphere and CD a numerical coeﬃcient. Assuming a circular orbit
the force Ft becomes (notice that ~l is anti-parallel to ~ve and thus anti-parallel to ~t

The power needed to compensate the drag therefore can be written as

The results for a value of CD = 2.2 are summarized in table 1. The needed power increases
much faster than the necessary current, so the main restriction is expected therefrom. Still,

it is remarkable that even at an altitude of 150km the necessary currents remain at a realistic
order of magnitude, which should allow to compensate the drag of a spacecraft with a wire

of about 1m length.

B. Orbital transfers

In this section we will present some estimates on the use of our device as a propellantless

propulsion system. We can distinguish three diﬀerent cases:

Below geostationary orbit In this region propulsion does not come for free, but a certain
amount of electrical power has to be provided to establish a propulsive current I.

Therefore two diﬀerent technological limitations can arise:

1. The propulsive force is proportional to the current, which is limited by the char-

acters of the wire. Here we assume the wire to be superconducting as well and
the limiting current is the critical current, above which the wire switches into the
non-superconducting phase. Accordingly the resistance R in Eq. (8) will be set

to zero.

2. Below geostationary orbit the maximal available power can be the important
technological limit as well. This suggests to study situations where the available
power is kept ﬁxed.

Above geostationary orbit In Earth orbit the only reasonable technological limit is the
critical current of the wire, which should be reachable by means of an adjustable

resistance put into the closed wire. The necessity of high currents is illustrated by
comparing the propulsive force (2) to the gravitational attraction. While the leading
term of the latter falls oﬀ like 1/r2, the leading contribution from the former (the
magnetic dipole) behaves like 1/r3. Therefore the propulsive force decreases by one
power faster than the gravitational attraction, which must be compensated at large

values of r by high currents and/or a long wire.

The picture may change in Jovian orbit. While most interesting applications are above
the geostationary orbit, power nevertheless can turn out to be an issue. While propeling
the spacecraft the device actually produces power, whose amount due to the strong

magnetic ﬁeld is much bigger than in Earth orbit. While parts of it may be used for

power supply, a reasonable part is expected to be superﬂuous and must be gotten rid
of. Limits thereon again can yield limits on the maximal acceptable power.

From this we conclude that the diﬀerential equation (14) should be solved for two diﬀerent

cases, either with the current kept ﬁxed or with the available power kept ﬁxed. In the ﬁrst
case the integration is straightforward and the result becomes

the force scales linearly with Il. Given the fact that critical currents of the order of 105

This scenario makes sense below geostationary orbit, only. Starting at r = 7000km with

a power of 1W/kg the transfer times and maximal currents as displayed in table 3 are
obtained (for completeness the minimal strength of the magnetic ﬁeld is indicated as well).

For a spacecraft of 1000kg and a wire of 1m the third column gives the necessary current
in units of 103A. Of course, the current now diverges as we approach the geostationary

C. Going to Jupiter

As a further example we estimate roughly how this would look for a satellite in a prograde
orbit of Jupiter. For the Jovian magnetic ﬁeld we take

a 1m long device for a 1000kg spacecraft is taken as a guide. We intend to start with
Io (r = 422′000km) and to visit Europa (r = 670′900km), Ganymede (r = 1′070′000km)
and Callisto (r = 1′883′000km). The results indeed provide very interesting transfer times.

the workability of the device (mainly the cooling of the superconductors.) The last two

columns illustrate that these doubts are unwarrented due to the generated power from the
non-vanishing resistence in Eq. (8) that balances the critical current of the superconducting
wire; as an example the power provided by a current of 103Am ranges between 60W at
Callisto’s orbit up to 1kW at Io’s. It is self-evident to try to beneﬁt from this energy, but
as can be seen the superﬂuous power and the ensuing heat on board of the spacecraft will

be an issue. Therefore an alternative scenario where the total power that can be handeled
is restricted to 100W/kg is presented.

Of course, these numbers cover the circular spiraling out, only. A more realistic scenario

should investigate the feasibility of a complete maneuver including the capture in Jovian
orbit. Already at this point we have good reasons to be optimistic. As our device does
not depend on the plasma density its possibilities in Jovian orbit are quite interesting when
compared to electrodynamic tethers.2

D. Conclusions

In this paper we have presented an original device for propellantless propulsion in an external

magnetic ﬁeld based on a closed wire that is partially shielded from the magnetic ﬁeld by
means of a superconductive cylinder. Besides the basic working principles we gave estimates
on the eﬃciency of such a device in the orbits of the Earth and Jupiter. As for all propulsive

devices that rely on an external magnetic ﬁeld its workability depends a lot on the speciﬁc
i.e. the planet considered as well as the characteristics of the orbit. The
environment,

working principles of our device are similar to the ones of electrodynamic tethers. There
exists, however, an important diﬀerence: as we use a closed wire the current need not be
closed via the plasma and therefore the workability depends on the magnetic ﬁeld, but not

on the plasmasphere of the planet. On the other hand, our device depends on advanced
technological concepts, whose workability in space and whose implications on the system

design (such as the cooling of the superconductors etc.) have not yet been studied in detail.
However, from the promising results presented in this work we are optimistic that these
issues won’t change basic advantages of our concept.

One of the main distinction to be made is between orbits above and below the mag-
netostationary orbit, resp. Above the device is not just propellantless, but actually also

powerless, as the actual velocity and the velocity relative to the magnetic ﬁeld have diﬀerent
signs. The device then works in a passive mode and is able to convert energy from the planet
rotation into propulsion via the magnetic ﬁeld. Below geostationary orbit this is no longer

the case, propellantless propulsion is still possible but a certain amount of electrical power
must be provided by the satellite. Considering breaking the situation is reversed.

Applications above the magnetostationary orbit have been shown to be promising in
Jovian orbit. Thanks to its strong magnetic ﬁeld, relevant forces can be obtained in this
way and it was shown that a journey visiting the diﬀerent Jovian moons can be done within

In Earth orbit applications above the geostationary orbit suﬀer from
a reasonable time.
the weakness of the magnetic ﬁeld, but can still yield interesting numbers. In contrast to
this, orbits below the magnetostationary orbit should be considered more in detail here,

though the device cannot work in its most eﬃcient way in this region. Estimations have
been made for applications in drag compensation and in orbital transfers, for both cases

promising numbers are obtained.

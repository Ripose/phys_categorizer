We study localized two- and three-dimensional Langmuir solitons in the framework of model based
on generalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation that accounts for local and nonlocal contributions
to electron-electron nonlinearity. General properties of solitons are investigated analytically and
numerically. Evolution of three-dimensional localized wave packets has been simulated numerically.
The additional nonlinearities are shown to be able to stabilize both azimuthally symmetric two-
dimensional and spherically symmetric three-dimensional Langmuir solitons.

Starting from the early 70-th, the fundamental role of
Langmuir solitons (LS) in strong plasma turbulence is
commonly known [1, 2]. Formation of LS are connected
with the plasma extrusion from the regions of strong
high-frequency electric ﬁeld and trapping of plasmons
into the formed density well (caviton). However, in the
previous simpliﬁed theoretical models, two-dimensional
(2D) and 3D solitons occurs to be unstable with respect
to a collapse: above some threshold power, the size of
the structure shrinks inﬁnitely, forming density singular-
ity at ﬁnite time [1]. Physically, when the size of col-
lapson approaches few Debye radii rD, it should damp
rapidly which may result in fast plasma heating. Never-
theless, experimental observations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] of quasi-
2D and 3D Langmuir collapse demonstrate saturation of
wave-packet’s spatial scale at some minimum value be-
40)rD. It have been observed in Refs.
ing of order (10
÷
[6, 7] that at times t > 50ω−1
P i , where ωP i is the ion
plasma frequency, Langmuir wave packets show consid-
erably slow dynamics (subsonic regime). To our best
knowledge, these observations do not meet an appropri-
ate theoretical explanation yet.

Various additional linear and nonlinear eﬀects, such
as higher-order dispersion [8, 9, 10], the saturation
of nonlinearity [10, 11, 12], nonlocal wave interaction
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], may arrest wave collapse
both in 2D and in 3D [8, 9, 12, 13, 14]. As it is shown in
[20], the local part of electron-electron nonlinearity (re-
sulting from the interaction with the second harmonic)
counteracts the contraction of wave packet. At the same
time, the nonlocal contribution of the additional nonlin-
ear term was omitted in [20], though it is of great im-
portance for suﬃciently narrow and intense wave pack-
ets. In this Letter we take into consideration both these
extra nonlinear eﬀects. As it will be shown below, the
role of nonlocal nonlinearity is quantitatively even more

signiﬁcant. The nonlocal nonlinearity is of great impor-
tance not only when describing soliton formation in plas-
mas [13, 21, 22], but also in the theory of Bose-Einstein
condensates or matter waves [14, 15, 16, 19], and in
the construction of an adequate continuum model of the
electron-phonon interaction in discrete 2D and 3D lat-
tices [17, 18].

However, any of additional nonlinear terms (proportional
to C or Γ) prevents collapse in 2D as well as in 3D cases,
or, in the other words, reﬀ is bounded from below.

We will start our consideration with 2D Langmuir soli-
tons. Note the formal analogy between Eq. (10) for ra-
dial electric ﬁeld component in 2D case and NLSE for
vortex solitons ψ(R) exp (imϕ) with topological charge
m = 1 (see, e.g. [10]). However, in spite of zero value of
wave intensity at the soliton center, it has no phase dis-
location and corresponds to the ground state with min-
imum energy and zero angular momentum. In the con-
sidered case of Langmuir wave structures, the phase does
not depend on the radial coordinate, thus in Eq. (10)
ψ(R) may be considered as real function.

where the variational parameter µ characterizes the in-
verse soliton’s width: µ = 1/(√2 reﬀ). We have returned
to the nonscaled variables for variational analysis. The
trial function (11) has a correct asymptotic near the soli-
ton center. The Gaussian proﬁle gives a good approxi-
mation to soliton solutions, since, as it was argued in [14]
it represents an exact solution in the limit case of strong
nonlocality. The variational parameter µ0 corresponding
to stationary solutions of the form (11), is readily found
after standard procedure [23]:

The boundary-value problem described by the Eq. (10)
with zero boundary conditions at the soliton’s center
) was solved numerically
(R = 0) and at inﬁnity (R

by the shooting method. Solitons form two-parameter
family with parameters σ and λ. For each given non-
locality parameter σ we present the dependence N (λ)
known as “energy dispersion diagram” (EDD), which
are given in Fig. 1 (a). Note that all solitons are sta-
ble, which is similar to Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion [12],
since ∂N/∂λ > 0. To excite stable two-dimensional
Langmuir soliton, the threshold value N0 of input power
(critical plasmon number) should be exceeded. Vari-
ational approach predicts normalized critical plasmon
number to be N0 = 16π. This is in a very good agreement
with our numerical results, where N0
48.3. Moreover,
this simple variational analysis gives a good description
for all EDDs, and variational dependence N (λ) ﬁts bet-
ter the computed one when the parameter σ grows. It
is illustrated in the Fig. 1 (a) for diﬀerent σ. One can
see that at σ = 0, the shape of soliton diﬀers suﬃciently
from the simple proﬁle of the form (11) [compare Fig. 1
(c) with Fig. 1 (d),(e)]. The typical soliton proﬁles are
plotted in Fig. 1 (c)-(e). At the same plasmon number,
the soliton width is larger for solutions of Eq. (10) with
nonlocal nonlinearity (σ > 0) than for solutions with
σ = 0.

As it was stressed above, the eﬀective width of Lang-
muir wave packet in our model is bounded from be-
low. Figure 1 (b) represents the eﬀective soliton width
as function of plasmon number. The Reﬀ decays mono-
tonically and saturates at some nonzero minimum value
Rmin. This minimum width increases when parameter

σ increases, as it was estimated above [see Eq. (8)]. In
the dimensional variables, the minimum diameters of 2D
Langmuir structures are of order 10rD which is in a good
agreement with those observed experimentally in [5].

We have performed similar analytical and numerical
study for 3D radially-symmetric solitons. The corre-
sponding N (λ) and Reﬀ(N ) dependencies are shown in
Fig. 2 (a), (b). In the 3D case, plasmon number depends
on nonlinear frequency shift λ non-monotonically, and
the only stable soliton branch corresponds to ∂N/∂λ > 0,
as it follows from Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. There-
fore, in the 3D case, the threshold plasmon number Ncr
needed to excite stable Langmuir soliton should be ob-
tained from condition ∂N/∂λ = 0. Similarly to the
2D case, the eﬀective width Reﬀ of stable solitons de-
cays monotonically when plasmon number N grows, and

Rmin at N
value to be of order Ncr

We have investigated evolution of radially symmet-
ric Langmuir structures numerically in the framework of
Eq.
(9). The integration time step was splitted into
the linear and nonlinear parts, and both of them were
performed in the radial coordinate domain. During the
simulations, the conservation of integrals (2) and (3) has
been veriﬁed, and if the change of any integral exceeded
1%, the modelling was stopped. We used two types of
initial conditions: (i) perturbed stationary soliton solu-
tion of Eq. (10) which was found numerically, and (ii)
the Gaussian-like proﬁle. At the boundaries we assumed
that ∂ [Ψ(R, t)/R] /∂R = 0 at R
0 and Ψ(R, t) = 0 at
R

.

Stability properties of Langmuir solitons were found
to be in a very good agreement with our analytical pre-
dictions. Any localized wave packet having the number
of quanta below the threshold value N < Ncr always
spreads out, while an initially more intense packet with
N > Ncr may form a localized structure after irradiat-
ing a portion of plasmons. The dynamics of intense wave
packet with N > Ncr is very intriguing. Figure 3 rep-
resents the diﬀerent evolution scenarios of perturbed 3D
Langmuir solitons. The amplitude and eﬀective width of
slightly perturbed soliton solution belonging to the stable
branch (with ∂N/∂λ > 0) oscillate in time as it is seen
in Fig. 3 (a). However, when perturbed, an unstable
stationary solution (having ∂N/∂λ < 0) manifests diﬀer-
ent evolution pattern: it can either monotonically spread
out [see Fig. 3 (c)] or develop quasiperiodical motion
[see Fig. 3 (b)], depending on the initial perturbation.
The latter quasiperiodical behavior resembles the oscil-
lations between two opposite extreme states discussed in
[14, 19]. The initial increase of wave packet’s intensity is
followed by quasiperiodical oscillations with rather large
amplitude. Thus, the additional nonlinearities actually
prevent catastrophic collapse of any 3D Langmuir wave
packets. The similar regime is known as ”frustrated col-
lapse” [19] in theory of Bose-Einstein condensates with
nonlocal nonlinear interaction.

experimental observations of Langmuir wave structures
in unmagnetized laboratory plasmas [6, 7]. On the slow
(subsonic) stage of evolution, which was observed at time
t > 50ω−1
P i , the ﬁeld envelope almost stopped its ra-
dial contraction and the size remained approximately un-
changed (r is of order of few tens of rD). It is important
to note that according to [6, 7] at this stage of Langmuir
structure evolution, the beam-wave resonance is detuned
and the beam decouples from the wave. Nevertheless,
the common Zakharov set of equations describes ﬁeld
evolution only for rather short time (t < 50ω−1
P i ) and
then its prediction drastically deviates from experimen-
tal facts because the wave packet becomes too intense

∼

max/4πnT

(at peak E2
1) and too narrow. As it was
demonstrated above, the electron-electron nonlinearity
plays a crucial role in Langmuir structure behavior and
it gives the qualitative explanation of saturation of the
wave packet contraction. The dissipative eﬀects such as
Landau and transit-time damping seems to be negligible
for structures of several tens Debye’s radius characteris-
tic size. Certainly, the wave packet may interact with
high-energy electrons, therefore, after a long time (of or-
der of several hundreds of ω−1
P i ), it may eventually damp
due to wave absorption. Our considerations are valid at
stage when nonlocal nonlinearities come into play and
considerably slow down the wave packet contraction but

the wave absorption is still not essential.

In conclusion, we have performed analytical and nu-
merical studies of spatial (2D and 3D) Langmuir solitons
in the framework of model based on generalized nonlin-
ear Sch¨odinger equation including both local and non-
local electron-electron nonlinearities. Their inﬂuence on
intense and narrow Langmuir wave packets are of the
same order, and both nonlinearities should be taken into
account simultaneously. Any of them is able to arrest the
Langmuir collapse. Both nonlinearities lead to the sat-

uration of soliton width with an increase of the energy,
but quantitatively the eﬀect of nonlocal nonlinearity is
more signiﬁcant. All 2D Langmuir solitary structures
are stable, while in 3D case, two soliton branches coexist,
one is stable and the other is unstable. When perturbed,
stable solitons demonstrate centrosymmetric oscillations.
As for 3D solitons from the unstable branch, they may
either spread out or oscillate quasiperiodically depending
on perturbation applied.

Vector magnetic ﬁeld observations of the solar wind interaction with Phobos were acquired by MAGMA and
FGMM during Phobos-2 mission in regions which have not been explored before. Phobos deﬂects the ﬂow
of the solar wind and the subsolar stand-oﬀ distance of the deﬂection is about 16-17 Phobos radii. Source
with equivalent magnetic moment M ′ ≃ 1015 A·m2 in Phobos leads to the development of such an obstacle
for solar wind ﬂow around Phobos.

Small bodies of the Solar System are of interest because of their potential for the clues they hold about
the nature and origin of how small bodies and planets were formed. Interplanetary spacecrafts have passed
near four asteroids: Gaspra, Ida, Braille, and Eros; and signatures of the solar wind-asteroid interaction in
magnetic ﬁeld observations were used in three cases to infer the presence of an intrinsic asteroidal magnetic
ﬁeld. The Martian moon Phobos refers to seized asteroid bodies.

The trajectory of Phobos-2 provided the collection of data in regions which are appropriate for an in-
vestigation of interaction of Phobos with the solar wind and have not been explored before. Analyzing
the interaction of the Phobos obstacle with the solar wind plasma, Mordovskaya et al. (2001) came to the
conclusion that Phobos has its own magnetic ﬁeld and its magnetic moment is M ′ ≃ 1015 A·m2.

Since the density of Phobos is 2 g/cm3, on the face of it the Phobos substance can be carbonaceous
chondrites. Using the magnetic properties of the carbonaceous chondrites, the estimate of the magnetic
moment of Phobos M ′ ≃ 1012 A·m2 was obtained by Oraevsky et al. (1989) and Dolginov et al. (1989).

INTRODUCTION

One of the main purposes of the investigation is to show that Phobos deﬂects the ﬂow of the solar wind.
The subsolar stand-oﬀ distance of the deﬂection is about 16-17 Phobos radii. The sizes of Phobos are
18 × 21 × 27 km. The eﬀective scale of the Phobos obstacle for the solar wind can be considered as a
main argument in favor of the existence of an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos. This scale depends on
the intrinsic magnetic moment of the magnetized bodies considered. The boundary of the obstacle varies
in close relation with the variations of the solar wind parameters. So, the solar wind can be stopped and
deﬂected away from Phobos by a magnetic barrier, which is compressed or expands depending on the solar
wind ram pressure variations.

THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD SIGNATURES NEAR PHOBOS ON
CIRCULAR ORBITS FROM MARCH 22 UNTIL MARCH 26, 1989

Vector measurements of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld during Phobos-2 mission were acquired by two mag-
netometers, FGMM and MAGMA (Riedler et al., 1989). Both instruments had a dynamic range of 100 nT

2

and data were transmitted every 1.5, 2.5, 45 and 600 s, depending on the telemetry mode of the spacecraft.
From March 22, 1989, to March 26, 1989, at each orbit around Mars, both Phobos-2 spacecraft and the
Mars satellite Phobos were inside the solar wind and within the Martian magnetosphere during 3.8 h. The
spacecraft was located permanently in a vicinity of Phobos at this time and the distances between them
were 200–400 km. A description of the spacecraft ﬂight proﬁle is given by Kolyuka et al. (1991).

The morphology of the magnetic ﬁeld signatures caused by the interaction of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld
with the solar wind plasma and observed during the time interval of March 22–26, 1989 are presented in
Figs. 1–3.

To illustrate that the magnetic ﬁeld disturbances are not associated with the solar wind interaction with
Mars, we plot the spacecraft traectory in the projection onto the Mars ecliptic plane XoY (X-axis points
to the Sun). The top pannels of Figs. 1–3 present the segment of the spacecraft trajectory where these
magnetic ﬁelds were acquired.

The plot of the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld (B) versus the time illustrates that the phenomenon
does exist (see the middle pannels of Figs. 1–3). An absence of data for some time intervals leads to the
fragmentary plot. In Figures 1–3, the magnitude of the observed magnetic ﬁeld is marked by the solar wind
parameters (Vs—the solar wind velocity in km/cek, Ns—the solar wind density in cm−3) to illustrate that
the manifestation of the phenomenon depends on the solar wind parameters. The arrows mark the time
when the parameters were acquired.

The plot of the spacecraft traectory relative to Phobos illustrates that the magnetic ﬁeld disturbances are
really associated with the solar wind interaction with Phobos. The distance Rx between Phobos and the
spacecraft versus the time of the observation is represented in the bottom pannels of Figs. 1–3. There is a
clear correspondence between the disturbance of the magnetic ﬁeld and the approaches of the spacecraft to
Phobos. Below, the signs of the magnetic ﬁeld components (Bsx, Bsy, Bsz) of the undisturbed solar wind
are presented to indicate an association of the manifestation of the phenomenon with the directions of the
interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld.

The presented examples show the response of the solar wind to the Phobos obstacle. The solar wind
begins “to feel” the obstacle at distances of 200–300 km from Phobos, the distance depends on the solar
wind plasma parameteres. The events displayed in Fig. 1 were observed in the solar wind plasma with high
density (Ns). Figures 2 and 3 give the examples of the interaction of the solar wind of lower density with
the Phobos obstacles.

On March 24, 1989, the dynamic pressure of the solar wind begins to decrease. The density of the solar
wind decreased down to 0.5–1 cm−3 during this period. When the speed Vs of the solar wind falls down to

4

600 km/s, it was possible to observe a remarkable event shown in Fig. 2c. During 18:43–19:41 on March
24, 1989 the magnetic ﬁeld signature has a sharp rise with a characteristic “shock-like” behavior which can
be associated with an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos.

There are two ways to describe the magnetic phenomenon.

In the present paper we investigated the
magnetic events by using the magnetic ﬁeld signatures (magnetograms). We conclude that the phenomenon
does exist. But the method used does not give a grasp of the phenomenon. In the paper by Mordovskaya
et al. (2001) a diﬀerent approach was used to understand the nature of the events.

Magnetic ﬁelds can be described with help of magnetic ﬁeld lines. Applying this technique it is possible
to understand the nature of events observed: the magnetic ﬁeld signatures result from the interaction of the
solar wind with the Phobos obstacle or they are related to an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos. Analyzing
the magnetic ﬁeld direction near Phobos, we determined with a great accuracy the boundary between
completely open ﬁeld lines of the solar wind and those with at least one end in Phobos. A dramatic change
in ﬁeld line topology is evidenced from 18:43 to 19:41 on March 24, 1989, thereby indicating a transition
from ﬁeld lines with no connection to Phobos to ﬁeld lines with at least one end in Phobos.

THE OBSERVATION OF THE PLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD OF PHOBOS

The periapsis of the Phobos-2 spacecraft was far from the dayside surface of Phobos, the smallest altitude
is 170–180 km. We could directly probe the regions to see pure planetary magnetic ﬁeld when the dynamic
pressure of the solar wind dropped. There is a unique case of the manifestation of the Phobos intrinsic
magnetic ﬁeld during 18:43–19:41 on March 24, 1989 (Fig. 2c). For the best understanding of the phe-
nomenon, we display the three components of the measured magnetic ﬁeld, velocity V, and electron density
N of plasma ﬂow for this event (see Fig. 4).

are displayed. The X-axis points to the Sun; the X-Y plane coincides with the orbital plane of Mars; the Y -axis
points in opposite direction of the Mars orbital velocity; the Z-axis is perpendicular to X and Y . Right panels: plots

During this period, the magnetic ﬁeld signature has a sharp rise with a characteristic “shock-like” behavior,
which is marked by the arrows. The velocity and density measured demonstrate a lack of the solar wind
plasma. This fact gives a strong argument in favour of the existence of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld and its
magnetosphere. Thus we assume that the satellite was in the subsolar point of the magnetosphere of Phobos
during 18:43–19:41 on March 24, 1989.

s = 1/8π (cid:0)2M ′/D3

We use the equation of pressure balance for the solar wind and the magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos at the
magnetopause and the experimental data to estimate the magnetic moment of Phobos M ′ in the dipole
approximation: 2NsmpV 2
, where D is the distance from the center of the planet up to
its subsolar point, Ns and Vs are the density and the speed of the solar wind, respectively, mp is the proton
mass. The measured values of the concentration and the speed of the solar wind, which are used to estimate
the magnetic moment M ′, are Ns = 0.6cm−3 and Vs = 600km/s. The estimate obtained is M ′ ≃ 1015 A·m2.
It is a source with such magnetic moment in Phobos that can deﬂect the solar wind ﬂow at the distance
over 170 km from the dayside of Phobos.

2
(cid:1)

It is necessary to note that Slavin et al. (1993) argued that this event can be explained by an unusually
distant position of the Mars bow shock. This explanation is based on the low density of the solar wind
plasma. However, Yeroshenko (2000) shown in detail that this explanation fails to be true. In addition, I
would like to point out a severe limitation of the method used in the work (Slavin et al., 1993). To describe
the extremely far displacement of the bow shock of Mars, they made use of a simple gas-dynamic model
which is applicable to the bodies like Earth with a strong intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld, which is suﬃcient for
deﬂecting the external plasma at altitudes far above the planet surface. Mars has a week intrinsic magnetic
ﬁeld with an estimated upper limit for a Mars dipole moment of M ′ ≃ 1018 A·m2 (Russell et al., 1995,
Acuna et al., 1999). The value of the Mars magnetic moment used by Slavin et al. (1993), M ′ ≃ 1019 A·m2,
is wrong, because the nature of the magnetic ﬁeld of Mars observed by the spacesrafts Mars 5 and Phobos-2
is a drapped induced magnetic ﬁeld. This factor puts restriction on the applicability of the model or at least
requires its serious corrections.

CONCLUSION

In this study we have considered the solar wind interaction with Phobos using the magnetic ﬁeld and
plasma data from the Phobos-2 mission during the closest ﬂy-by on March 22–26, 1989. The magnetic ﬁeld
disturbances observed are correlated with the approaches of the spacecraft to Phobos. In the magnetic ﬁeld
signatures the manifestation of the interaction depends on the plasma parameters of the solar wind and
are diﬀerent for low and high plasma density. On the other hand, the clear observation of the planetary
magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos is highly controlled by the Bsz, Bsy > 0 directions of the interplanetary magnetic
ﬁeld.

It was shown that Phobos deﬂects the ﬂow of the solar wind and the subsolar stand-oﬀ distance of the
deﬂection is about 16–17 Phobos radii. By using an analogy with the Earth, from the equation of pressure
balance for the solar wind and the magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos at the magnetopause we calculate the equivalent
magnetic moment M ′, source of which in Phobos leads to the development of such an obstacle for solar wind
ﬂow around Phobos. In the dipole approximation, the magnetic moment of Phobos is M ′ ≃ 1015 A·m2.

It is worth noting that the sizes of Phobos and an ion gyroradius of the interplanetary plasma have the
same order of values. It point out the Phobos magnetosphere to be a system having fundamental diﬀerences
with that of the Earth.

In conclusion, the magnetization of Phobos substance is 0.15 CGS. The third part of volume of Phobos
should consist of a magnetic substance similar to a magnetite Fe3O4 in order to obtain the given magne-
tization of Phobos. Since the density of Phobos is about 2 g/cm3, we can suggest two explanations for
the magnetization observed. First, Phobos is non-uniform and there exists an immense piece of a mag-
netic material within it. Second, Phobos consists of small pieces of a magnetic substance immersed into a
non-magnetic low density material.

Abstract. We apply the ﬁnite size scaling technique to
quantify the statistical properties of ﬂuctuations in AU, AL
and AE indices and in the ǫ parameter that represents en-
ergy input from the solar wind into the magnetosphere. We
ﬁnd that the exponents needed to rescale the probability
density functions (PDF) of the ﬂuctuations are the same to
within experimental error for all four quantities. This self-
similarity persists for time scales up to ∼ 4 hours for AU, AL
and ǫ and up to ∼ 2 hours for AE. Fluctuations on shorter
time scales than these are found to have similar long-tailed
(leptokurtic) PDF, consistent with an underlying turbulent
process. These quantitative and model-independent results
place important constraints on models for the coupled solar
wind-magnetosphere system.

1. Introduction

Recently, there has been considerable interest in viewing
the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere as a complex system
where multiscale coupling is a fundamental aspect of the
dynamics (see [Chang, 1999; Chapman and Watkins, 2001;
Consolini and Chang, 2002; Hnat et al., 2002] and refer-
ences therein). Examples of the observational motivation
for this approach are i) bursty transport events in the mag-
netotail [Angelopoulos et al., 1992] and ii) evidence that the
statistics of these events are self-similar (as seen in auro-
ral images [Lui et al., 2000]). Geomagnetic indices are of
particular interest in this context as they provide a global
measure of magnetospheric output and are evenly sampled
over a long time interval. There is a wealth of literature
on the magnetosphere as an input-output system (see for
example, [Klimas et al., 1996; Sharma, 1995; Sitnov et al.,
2000; Tsurutani et al., 1990; Vassiliadis et al., 2000; V¨or¨os
et al., 1998]). Recent work has focussed on comparing some
aspects of the scaling properties of input parameters such
as ǫ [Perreault and Akasofu, 1978] and the AE index [Davis
and Sugiura, 1966] to establish whether, to the lowest order,
they are directly related [Freeman et al., 2000; Uritsky et al.,
2001]. Although these studies are directed at understanding
the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere in the context of Self-

Organized Criticality (SOC), a comprehensive comparison
of the scaling properties of the indices, and some proxy for
the driver (ǫ) also has relevance for the predictability of this
magnetospheric “output” from the input. Importantly, both
“burstiness” (or intermittency) and self-similarity can arise
from several processes including SOC and turbulence. In-
deed, SOC models exhibit threshold instabilities, bursty ﬂow
events and statistical features consistent with the “scale-
free” dynamics such as power law power spectra.
It has
been proposed by Chang [1992, 1999] that magnetospheric
dynamics are indeed in the critical state or near it. Alterna-
tively, Consolini and De Michelis [1998] used the Castaing
distribution – the empirical model derived in Castaing et al.
[1990] and based on a turbulent energy cascade – to ob-
tain a two parameter functional form for the Probability
Density Functions (PDF) of the AE ﬂuctuations on various
temporal scales. Turbulent descriptions of magnetospheric
measures also model observed statistical intermittency, i.e.,
the presence of large deviations from the average value on
diﬀerent scales [Consolini et al., 1996; V¨or¨os et al., 1998].
An increased probability of ﬁnding such large deviations is
manifested in the departure of the PDF from Gaussian to-
ward a leptokurtic distribution [Sornette, 2000].

In this paper we will quantify both the intermittency and
the self-similarity of the AU, AL, AE and ǫ time series using
the technique of ﬁnite size scaling. This has the advantage
of being model independent, and is also directly related to
both turbulence models such as that of Castaing [Castaing
et al., 1990] and a Fokker-Planck description of the time se-
ries. The method was used in Hnat et al. [2002] where the
mono-scaling of the solar wind magnetic energy density ﬂuc-
tuations was reported. We will ﬁnd that ﬂuctuations in all
four quantities are strongly suggestive of turbulent processes
and by quantifying this we can compare their properties di-
rectly.

The AL, AU and AE indices data set investigated here
comprises over 0.5 million, 1 minute averaged samples from
January 1978 to January 1988 inclusive. The ǫ parameter

is an estimate of the fraction of the solar wind Poynting
ﬂux through the dayside magnetosphere and was calculated
from the WIND spacecraft key parameter database [Lepping
et al., 1995; Ogilvie et al., 1995]. It comprises over 1 million,
46 second averaged samples from January 1995 to December
1998 inclusive. The selection criteria for solar wind data was
given by the component of the spacecraft position vector
along the Earth-Sun line, X > 0, and the vector magnitude,
R > 30 RE. The data set includes intervals of both slow
and fast speed streams. The time series of indices and that
of the ǫ parameter were obtained in diﬀerent time intervals
and here we assume that the samples are long enough to be
statistically accurate.

2. Scaling of the indices and ǫ

The statistical properties of complex systems can exhibit
a degree of universality reﬂecting the lack of a characteristic

scale in their dynamics. A connection between the statistical
approach and the dynamical one is given by a Fokker-Planck
(F-P) equation [van Kampen, 1992] which describes the dy-
namics of the Probability Density Function (PDF) and, in
the most general form, can be written as:

∂P (x, t)
∂t

= ∇(P (x, t)γ(x)) + ∇

D(x)P (x, t),

(3)

2

where P (x, t) is a PDF of some quantity x that varies with
time t, γ is the friction coeﬃcient and D(x) is a diﬀusion
coeﬃcient which in this case can vary with x. For certain
choices of D(x), a class of self-similar solutions of (3) satisﬁes
a ﬁnite size scaling (in the usage of Sornette [2000], pg. 85,
henceforth “scaling”) relation given by:

P (x, τ ) = τ

−sPs(xτ

−s).

(4)

This scaling is a direct consequence of the fact that the F-
−s
P equation is invariant under the transformation x → xτ
and P → P τ s. If, for given experimental data, a set of PDFs
can be constructed, on diﬀerent temporal scales τ , that sat-
isfy relation (4) then a diﬀusion coeﬃcient and correspond-
ing F-P equation can be found to represent the data. A
simple example is the Brownian random walk with s = 1/2,
D(x) =constant and Gaussian PDFs on all scales. Alter-
natively one can treat the identiﬁcation of the scaling ex-
ponent s and, as we will see, the non-Gaussian nature of
the rescaled PDFs (Ps) as a method for quantifying the in-
termittent character of the time series. Practically, obtain-
ing the rescaled PDFs involves ﬁnding a rescaling index s
directly from the integrated time series of the quantity X
[Hnat et al., 2002; Sornette, 2000].

Let X(t) represent the time series of the studied signal,
in our case AU, AL, AE or the ǫ parameter. A set of time
series δX(t, τ ) = X(t + τ ) − X(t) is obtained for each value
of non-overlapping time lag τ . The PDF P (δX, τ ) is then
obtained for each time series δX(t, τ ). Figure 1 shows these
PDFs for the δAU . A generic scaling approach is applied to
these PDFs. Ideally, we use the peaks of the PDFs to obtain
the scaling exponent s, as the peaks are the most populated
parts of the distributions.
In certain cases, however, the
peaks may not be the optimal statistical measure for ob-
taining the scaling index. For example, the Bz component
in (2) as well as the AU and AL indices are measured with
an absolute accuracy of about 0.1 nT. Such discreteness in
the time series and, in the case of the ǫ ﬂuctuations, the
large dynamical range introduce large errors in the estima-
tion of the peak values P (0, τ ) and may not give a correct
scaling. Since, if the PDFs rescale, we can obtain the scaling
exponent from any point on the curve in principle, we also
determine the scaling properties of the standard deviation
σ(τ ) of each curve P (δX, τ ) versus δX(t, τ ).

Figure 2 shows P (0, τ ) plotted versus τ on log-log axes
for δX = δǫ, δAE, δAU and δAL. Straight lines on such
a plot suggest that the rescaling (4) holds at least for the
peaks of the distributions. On ﬁgure 2, lines were ﬁtted with
R2 goodness of ﬁt for the range of τ between 4 and 136 min-
utes, omitting points corresponding to the ﬁrst two temporal
scales as in these cases the sharp peaks of the PDFs can not
be well resolved. The lines suggest self-similarity persists
up to intervals of τ = 97 − 136 minutes. The slopes of
these lines yield the exponents s and these are summarized
in Table 1 along with the values obtained from analogous

plots of σ(τ ) versus τ which show the same scale break. We
note that, for the ǫ parameter, the scaling index s obtained
from the P (0, τ ) is diﬀerent from the Hurst exponent mea-
sured from the σ(τ ). This diﬀerence could be a result of
the previously discussed diﬃculties with the ǫ data. How-
ever, it does appear to be a feature of some real time se-
ries (see Gopikrishnan et al [1999] for example).
Indeed,
such a diﬀerence between index s and Hσ is predicted in the
case of the fractional L´evy motion [Chechkin and Gonchar,
2000]. We see that, for the ǫ as well as the AL and AU in-
dices, there is a range of τ up to 4.5 hours for which P (0, τ )
−s with
plotted versus τ is well described by a power law τ
indices s = 0.42 ± 0.03 for the ǫ and s = 0.45 ± 0.02 and
s = 0.47±0.03 for the AL and AU indices, respectively. Thus
the break in scaling at 4 − 5 hours in the AL and AU indices
may have its origin in the solar wind, although the physical
reason for the break at this timescale in epsilon is unclear.
The break in the AE index, however, appears to occur at a
smaller temporal scale of 2 hours, consistent with the scaling
break timescale found in the same index by other analysis
methods [Consolini and De Michelis, 1998; Takalo et al.,
1993]. This was interpreted by [Takalo et al., 1993] as due
to the characteristic substorm duration. Takalo et al. [1998]
also reported a scaling break at the same 2 hour timescale
for AL, in contrast to the 4 − 5 hour timescale found here.
Indeed, one might have expected a substorm timescale to
cause the same scaling break in both the AE and AL in-
dices, because their substorm signatures are so similar in
proﬁle (e.g., Figure 2 of Caan et al. [1978]). The resolution
may lie in the diﬀerence between analysis of diﬀerenced and
undiﬀerenced data [Price and Newman, 2001].

Within this scaling range we now attempt to collapse each
corresponding unscaled PDF onto a single master curve us-
ing the scaling (4).

If the initial assumption of the self-similar solutions is
correct, a single parameter rescaling, given by equation (4)
for a mono-fractal process, would give a perfect collapse of
PDFs on all scales. Figures 3 and 4 show the result of the
one parameter rescaling applied to the unscaled PDF of the
δǫ and the δAU index ﬂuctuations, respectively, for the tem-
poral scales up to ∼ 4.5 hours. We see that the rescaling
procedure (4) using the value of the exponent s of the peaks
P (0, τ ) shown in Fig 2, gives good collapse of each curve onto
a single common functional form for the entire range of the
data. These rescaled PDFs are leptokurtic rather than a
Gaussian and are thus strongly suggestive of an underlying
turbulent process.

The successful rescaling of the PDFs now allows us to
perform a direct comparison of the PDFs for all four quan-
tities. Figure 5 shows these normalized PDFs Ps(δX, τ ) for
δX = δǫ, δAE and τ ≈ 1 hour overlaid on a single plot. The
δX variable has been normalized to the rescaled standard
deviation σs(τ ≈ 1hr) of Ps in each case to facilitate this
comparison. We then ﬁnd that AE and ǫ ﬂuctuations have
indistinguishable Ps. The PDFs of δAU and δAL are asym-
metric such that −δAL ﬁts δAU PDF closely (see insert in
the ﬁgure 5); when overlaid on the PDFs of the δǫ and δAE
these are also indistinguishable within errors. This provides
strong evidence that the dominant contributions to the AE
indices come from the eastward and westward electrojets
of the approximately symmetric DP2 current system that
is driven directly by the solar wind [Freeman et al., 2000].
The mono-scaling of the investigated PDFs, together with

!! Please write \lefthead{<AUTHOR NAME(s)>} in ﬁle !!:

the ﬁnite value of the samples’ variance, indicates that a
Fokker-Planck approach can be used to study the dynamics
of the unscaled PDFs within their temporal scaling range.

3. Summary

In this paper we have applied the generic and model inde-
pendent scaling method to study the scaling of ﬂuctuations
in the ǫ parameter and the global magnetospheric indices
AU, AL and AE. The similar values of the scaling exponent
and the leptokurtic nature of the single PDF that, to within
errors, describes ﬂuctuations on time scales up to τmax in all
four quantities provide an important quantitative constraint
for models of the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere system.
One possibility is that, up to τmax ∼ 4 hours, ﬂuctuations in
AU and AL are directly reﬂecting those seen in the turbu-
lent solar wind. The data also suggest that AE index departs
from this scaling on shorter time scale of τmax ∼ 2 hours.
Importantly, identifying a close correspondence in the ﬂuc-
tuation PDF of ǫ, AE, AU and AL may simply indicate that
ﬂuctuations in the indices are strongly coupled to dayside
processes and are thus weak indicators of the ﬂuctuations
in nightside energy output. The leptokurtic nature of the
PDFs is strongly suggestive of turbulent processes, and in
the case of AU and AL, these may then be either just that of
the turbulent solar wind (and here ǫ) or may be locally gen-
erated turbulence which has an indistinguishable signature
in its ﬂuctuation PDF. In this case our results quantify the
nature of this turbulence. We note, however, that certain
classes of complex systems [Chang et al., 1992a] are in prin-
ciple capable of “passing through” input ﬂuctuations into
their output without being directly driven in the present
sense [Chang, private communication, 2002]. Finally, the
rescaling also indicates that a Fokker-Planck approach can
be used to study the evolution of the ﬂuctuation PDF. This
raises a possibility of a new approach to understanding mag-
netospheric dynamics.

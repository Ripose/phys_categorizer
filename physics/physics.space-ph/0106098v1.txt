Abstract. Observations indicate that the magnetotail convection is turbulent and

bi-modal, consisting of fast bursty bulk ﬂows (BBF) and a nearly stagnant background.

We demonstrate that this observed phenomenon may be understood in terms of the

intermittent interactions, dynamic mergings and preferential accelerations of coherent

magnetic structures under the inﬂuence of a background magnetic ﬁeld geometry that

is consistent with the development of an X-point mean-ﬁeld structure.

1. Introduction

Recent satellite observations indicate that the Earth’s magnetotail is generally

in a state of intermittent turbulence constantly intermixed with localized fast bursty

bulk ﬂows (BBF) [Angelopoulos et al., 1996; Lui, 1998]. A model of sporadic and

localized merging of coherent magnetic structures has been proposed by Chang [1999;

and references contained therein] to describe the dynamics of the magnetotail. When

conditions are favorable, the coherent structures may merge, interact, convect and evolve

into forced and/or self- organized critical (FSOC) states [Chang, 1992], a condition

satisﬁed by the observational statistics of the burst duration characteristics of the

BBF [Angelopoulos, 1999]. When considered with the realistic magnetotail geometry,

the coarse-grained dissipation of turbulent ﬂuctuations produced by the interacting

multi-scale coherent structures may trigger “ﬂuctuation-induced nonlinear instabilities”

and possibly initiate substorms. Some of the above ideas have been demonstrated

by direct numerical simulations [Wu and Chang, 2000]. In this paper, we address

the dynamics, particularly the preferential acceleration, of the coherent structures in

sheared magnetic ﬁeld geometry. Preliminary comparisons of the theoretical ideas and

new numerical results with the observed characteristics of BBF will also be presented.

2. Observational Properties of BBF

In situ observations [Angelopoulos et al., 1999; Nagai et al., 1998 and references

contained therein] indicate that BBF are an important means of magnetotail transport.

Removing the fast BBF, the remaining ﬂow state has a small average convection. The

BBF are seen during precursor activity, at substorm expansion and recovery phases.

Near-Earth BBF are primarily Earthward and consist of multiple, short-lived ﬂow

bursts, i.e., they are intermittent. Distribution functions of mid-tail BBF near the

source region of a tailward-retreating reconnection site at late substorm expansion phase

4

show that multiple, localized acceleration sites are responsible for the observed ﬂows

[Angelopoulos et al., 1996]. Distant tail fast ﬂows are tailward, they are associated with

plasmoids, they also have multiple ﬂow peaks and multiple current ﬁlaments within

them, and they are likely localized in the cross-tail dimension (e.g. Ieda et al. [2001]

and references therein). Thus although preferential acceleration is observed on either

side of a mid-tail region, probably associated with the gross formation of an X-point

topology, the ﬂows and the currents within them are rather intermittent.

When considered in connection with an observed X-point, the primary directions

of convection of BBF are earthward (tailward) when they are situated earthward

(tailward) of the X-point [Nagai et al., 1998]. It is therefore of preponderate interest to

decipher the fundamental physical mechanism that are responsible for the preferential

acceleration and convective nature of the observed BBF.

It had been suggested by Chang [1992] that the magnetotail could exhibit dynamic

forced and/or self-organized critical (FSOC) behavior. Statistical studies of the AE

index [Consolini, 1997] and global auroral imagery [Lui et al., 2000] during substorm

times seem to indicate consistency with such a dynamic description. More recently,

Angelopoulos et al. [1999] demonstrated speciﬁcally that the probability distribution

of the BBF duration could also be described by a power law, an indication of dynamic

criticality. A physically realistic topological model based on the coherent magnetic

structures was proposed by Chang [1998, 1999] to explain the multiscale nature of the

intermittent turbulence that can lead to the FSOC state in the magnetotail and its low

dimensional behavior [Klimas et al., 1996]. It was also suggested that the coarse-grained

dissipation of the ﬂuctuations associated with FSOC could lead to nonlinear instabilities

and trigger the development of mean-ﬁeld X-point magnetic structures in sheared

magnetic ﬁelds. We shall demonstrate below that these ideas lead naturally to the

preferential acceleration and observed convective nature of the fast BBF.

3. Coherent Magnetic Structures in Earth’s Magnetotail

There is considerable evidence that many turbulent ﬂows are far from being totally

disorganized. Indeed they can posses “coherent structures,” as indicated by experiments

and numerical simulations [e.g., Frisch, 1995]. Chang [1998] suggested that the coherent

structures are basically current ﬁlaments in the neutral sheet region of the magnetotail.

Most ﬁeld theoretical discussions begin with the concept of propagation of waves.

For example, in the MHD formulation, one can combine the basic equations and express

them in the following propagation forms:

ρdV/dt = B · ∇B + · · ·

dB/dt = B · ∇V + · · ·

where the ellipsis represents the eﬀects of the anisotropic pressure tensor, the

compressible and dissipative eﬀects, and all notations are standard. Equations (1,2)

admit the well-known Alfv´en waves. For such waves to propagate, the propagation

vector k must contain a ﬁeld-aligned component, i.e., B · ∇ → ik · B 6= 0. However, near

the singularities where the parallel component of the propagation vector vanishes (the

resonance sites), the ﬂuctuations are localized. That is, around these resonance sites

(usually in the form of curves in physical space), it may be shown that the ﬂuctuations

are held back by the background magnetic ﬁeld, forming coherent structures in the

form of ﬂux tubes [Chang, 1998; 1999]. For the neutral sheet region of the magnetotail,

these coherent structures are essentially force-free and in the form of current ﬁlaments

in the cross-tail direction [Chang, 1998]. If the cross-tall current is primarily carried

by the coherent magnetic structures, these structures will be strongly aﬀected by the

magnetic ﬁeld due to the Lorentz force. As they are being preferentially accelerated

they will dynamically deform and dissipate ﬂuctuations to produce smaller structures,

while occasionally interact and merge with neighboring structures.

6

4. Preferential Acceleration of BBF

Consider the coherent magnetic structures discussed in the previous section, which

in the neutral sheet region of the plasma sheet are essentially ﬁlaments of concentrated

currents in the cross-tail direction. As we have argued previously, in a sheared magnetic

ﬁeld, these multiscale ﬂuctuations can supply the required coarse-graining dissipation

that can produce nonlinear instabilities leading to X-point-like structures of the average

magnetic ﬁeld lines. For a sheared magnetic ﬁeld Bx(z), upon the onset of such

ﬂuctuation-induced nonlinear instabilities, the average magnetic ﬁeld will generally

acquire a z-component. Let us choose x as the Earth-magnetotail direction (positive

toward the Earth) and y in the cross-tail current direction. Then the deformed magnetic

ﬁeld geometry after the development of an X-point structure will generally have a

positive (negative) Bz component earthward (tailward) of the X-point. Near the neutral

sheet region, the Lorentz force will therefore preferentially accelerate the coherent

structures earthward if they are situated earthward of the X-point and tailward if they

are situated tailward of the X-point, Figure 1. These results would therefore match the

general directions of motion of the observed BBF in the magnetotail [Nagai et al., 1998].

We have performed two-dimensional numerical simulations to verify these

conjectures. The simulations are based on a compressible MHD model that has been

used by Wu and Chang [2000] in previously studies of coherent magnetic structures. In

the ﬁrst example we started the numerical simulation initially consisting of randomly

distributed magnetic ﬂuctuations with zero mean magnetic ﬁeld. The calculation

was carried out with 256 by 256 grid points in a doubly periodic (x, z) domain of

length 2π in both directions. Eventually, after some elapsed time, multiscale coherent

magnetic structures are formed, which are shown in Fig. 2(a) for 1.5π ≤ x ≤ 2π and

1.1π ≤ z ≤ 1.6π. The maximum magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld is 0.014. In this

and following examples, both pressure and density are about 1; the system has a large

plasma β to mimic the current sheet region. At this time, a uniform Bz = 0.002 is

7

introduced. In the middle panels of Fig. 2, the eﬀect of the Lorentz force is clearly

seen through the motions of the coherent structures after an additional elapsed time of

100. (For all numerical examples, the unit of time was based on the wave speeds. For

instance, the sound speed is about 1.3; thus a sound wave would traverse a distance

of π in a time of 2.4.) If the direction of Bz is reversed, the motions of the coherent

structures are also reversed as seen in the bottom panels of Fig. 2.

In the second example, we have considered the motions of the coherent magnetic

structures that developed in a sheared mean magnetic ﬁeld upon the initial introduction

of random magnetic ﬂuctuations. The calculation was carried out with 1280 by 256 grid

points in a doubly periodic (x, z) domain of length 10π in the x-direction and 2π in the

z-direction with a sheared magnetic mean ﬁeld Bx = 0.025 cos(z). The system again

has a high plasma β with both pressure and density about 1. These structures were

generally aligned in the x-direction near the neutral line, z = 1.5π, after some elapsed

time. A positive Bz = 0.001 was then applied. It can be seen (Figure 3) that, after

an additional elapsed time of 50, the coherent structures (mostly oriented by currents

in the positive y-direction), are generally accelerated in the positive x-direction; with

one exception where a pair of magnetic structures with oppositely directed currents

eﬀectively canceled out the net eﬀect of the Lorentz force on these structures. The

acceleration continues in time. We have plotted the x-component of the ﬂow velocities,

vx, due to the cumulative eﬀect of the Lorentz (and pressure) forces acting on the ﬂow

(and in particular the coherent structures) after additional duration of 400 has elapsed

(Fig. 4). We note that there are a number of peaks and valleys in the 3-dimensional

display, with peak velocities of about 0.02, nearly approaching that of the Alfv´en speed

(about 0.025 based on |B| = 0.025) mimicking the fast BBF that were observed in the

magnetotail. It is to be noted that an individual BBF event may be composed of one,

two, or several coherent structures.

In the ﬁnal plot (Fig. 5), we demonstrate in a self-consistent picture what

8

might occur near the neutral sheet region of the magnetotail. We injected randomly

distributed magnetic ﬂuctuations in a predominantly sheared magnetic ﬁeld, prescribed

by Bx = 0.1 cos(z) and Bz = 0.002 sin(x/5). The calculation was again carried out

with 1280 by 256 grid points in a doubly periodic (x, z) domain of length 10π in the

x-direction and 2π in the z-direction. Eventually, a large-scale X-point like mean ﬁeld

magnetic structure is produced. The coherent structures (aligned in the neutral sheet

region) are subsequently accelerated away from the X-point in both the positive and

negative x-directions. Contour plots of vx after some elapsed time clearly indicated such

eﬀects.

5. Summary

We demonstrated that dynamical evolutions of coherent magnetic structures

in an initially sheared magnetic ﬁeld might provide a convenient description of the

observed fast BBF in the Earth’s magnetotail, particularly near the neutral sheet region.

In the magnetotail, the coherent structures are essentially current ﬁlaments in the

cross-tail direction. In an X-point mean magnetic ﬁeld geometry, selective acceleration

of these coherent structures can be accomplished by the Lorentz force. Simulation

results demonstrate that the coherent magnetic structures can indeed be preferentially

accelerated this way near the neutral sheet and in the appropriate directions.

Although the X-point mean magnetic ﬁeld can be formed by nonlinear instabilities

due to the stochastic behavior of the coherent magnetic structures, it is not necessary

for the X-point to occur this way. An X-point magnetic ﬁeld geometry formed by

forced magnetic reconnection is likely to cause preferential acceleration of the coherent

structures in a similar manner.

Our work is just at the beginning. In the future, we shall consider more general

initial two-dimensional mean magnetic ﬁeld geometries. Moreover, the coherent

magnetic structures and interactions are usually three-dimensional, characterized by

9

sporadic and localized current disruptions [Lui, 1996], and the dynamics of the coherent

structures, intermittent turbulence, and global interactions are very complicated. We

shall look into such complexities. The characteristics of the ion velocity distributions of

the observed BBF generally have a crescent-moon shape in the x − z plane [Nagai et

al., 1998]. The localized merging of the coherent structures aligned in the neutral sheet

region would produce particle jets at the merging point normal to the neutral sheet both

in the north and south directions with velocities of the order of the Alfv´en speed. We

suggest that the combined consequence of such localized merging and the preferential

acceleration of the coherent structures would produce ion distributions in the BBF of

the form as observed. We shall begin a study of such detailed kinetic eﬀects.

Its peak velocities are about 0.02, nearly

because of the diﬀerence of scales in x and z in the plot, the accelerated structures have

the over-emphasized sheet-like shapes.

Abstract. We determine a simple expression for the ramp width of a collisionless
fast shock, based upon the relationship between the noncoplanar and main magnetic
ﬁeld components. By comparing this predicted width with that measured during
an observation of a shock, the shock velocity can be determined from a single
spacecraft. For a range of low-Mach, low-β bow shock observations made by the
ISEE-1 and -2 spacecraft, ramp widths determined from two-spacecraft comparison
and from this noncoplanar component relationship agree within 30%. When two-
spacecraft measurements are not available or are inefﬁcient, this technique provides
a reasonable estimation of scale size for low-Mach shocks.

Introduction

The determination of spatial scales within the collision-
less shock front is one of the central problems for obser-
vational shock physics. The width of the shock ramp,
deﬁned as the main transition layer between upstream
to downstream plasma, is of particular interest. Without
spacecraft measurements in a spatial rather then temporal
frame of reference, it is impossible to make any compar-
isons between observations and theoretical models.

For bow shock studies, generally one of two methods
has been applied to transform the time series observed by
in-situ magnetometers into a spatial magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle:
(1) the comparison of shock observations made by multi-
ple spacecraft with known separations in time and space
[for example, Russell et al., 1982; Farris et al., 1993; New-
bury and Russell, 1996], and (2) the comparison of the
temporal duration of the shock foot feature as observed
by a single spacecraft with the spatial foot length pre-
dicted by a model based on the motion of specularly re-
ﬂected ions [for example, Sckopke et al., 1983; Gosling
and Thomsen, 1985; Newbury and Russell, 1996]. Both
methods assume that the bow shock is stationary and one-
dimensional, and each has its own limitations. The ﬁrst is
not reliable when the time delay between spacecraft ob-
servations is too large [Newbury and Russell, 1996] (non-
stationarity can affect the results) or too small (relative

errors become large). Also, large transverse spatial sep-
arations of the spacecraft with respect to the shock front
can introduce error due to the three-dimensional nature of
the bow shock. The second method is not applicable to
laminar shocks (shocks observed during low Mach num-
ber and low plasma β conditions). Ion reﬂection does not
play a dominant dissipative role at such shocks, and so
there is little or no foot structure available to measure. (In
high Mach number shocks, the second method can also be
problematic, since the ion reﬂection is clearly not specu-
lar [Gosling and Thomsen, 1985; Gedalin, 1996c] which
affects the model’s predictions.)

Because of these limitations, it is desirable to have
another independent method for determining shock scale
lengths, particularly for laminar shock observations made
by a single spacecraft.
In this paper, we make use of
the noncoplanar component of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
shock ramp in order to estimate a scale size which can
in turn be compared with spacecraft observations of low
Mach number shocks. In Section 2 we brieﬂy outline the
theoretical basis of this method, and then apply the tech-
nique to an example of a bow shock observation made by
the ISEE spacecraft (Section 3). In Section 4, we exam-
ine the results obtained from a variety of low Mach and
low β bow shock observations, and ﬁnd that the proposed
method works well, even for shocks which are not strictly
laminar.

Theoretical Basis

Within the ramp layer of a fast collisionless shock (such
as the Earth’s bow shock), the magnetic ﬁeld is observed
to rotate out of the coplanarity plane (the plane deﬁned by
the shock normal and the upstream and downstream mag-
netic ﬁeld vectors) [Thomsen et al., 1987]. The analyti-
cal relation between this noncoplanar component and the
main magnetic component of the shock proﬁle was ﬁrst
derived by Jones and Ellison [1987] phenomenologically
in an integral form; its approximate nature has been shown
observationally by Gosling et al. [1988]; Friedman et al.
[1990]. Recently, Gedalin [1996a] examined the non-
coplanar relation using a general two-ﬂuid hydrodynam-
ics approach, and carried out the derivation with only the
widely accepted assumptions of shock stationarity, one-
dimensionality, and quasi-neutrality. In the coplanarity co-
ordinate system where N denotes the direction along the
shock normal, L is along the magnetic ﬁeld component
in the shock plane, and M is directed out of the copla-
narity plane, the general expression for the noncoplanar
magnetic ﬁeld component (BM ) is as follows:

N

in the limit me → 0, and where n is the number density; v
is the N component of the hydrodynamic velocity; BN =
const and nv = const (number ﬂux conservation); and Pij
are components of the pressure tensor.

It has been shown by Gedalin and Zilbersher [1995]
that the appearance of PN M is mainly due to the presence
of reﬂected ions, and that PN M ≪ numiV 2
u for low Mach
number shocks [Gedalin, 1996b]. For laminar shocks it is
expected [Thomsen et al., 1985] that the relative contribu-
tion of the pressure terms is ∼ β/M 2 l and therefore the
following approximate expression holds:

BM = lW

dBL
dN

,

(2)

where lW = c cos θBN /M ωpi (i.e., k = 1/lW would be
the wavenumber of a whistler, phasestanding upstream of
the ramp), θBN is the angle between the upstream mag-
netic ﬁeld and the shock normal, MA is the Alfv´enic Mach
number, and c/ωpi is the ion intertial length. It should be
emphasized that (2) is a differential analog of the integral
relation developed by Jones and Ellison [1987]. However,
(2) should be applied only within the ramp where the main
contribution ∝ dBL/dN is not small, otherwise the term
∝ PN M can dominate.

2

Therefore, by estimating the slope of the main mag-
netic ﬁeld component (dBL/dt) in the vicinity of the max-
imum noncoplanar component in an observed shock ramp,
one can determine an independent estimate of the velocity
of the shock front from (2). It is then straightforward to
transform the observed temporal shock proﬁle into a spa-
tial one suitable for comparison with theory, other shock
observations, and/or simulations. An advantage of the
method outlined above is that it gives the scale in the rel-
ative physical units and not absolute units. It encounters,
however, the same difﬁculties from the determination of
the vector basis (N, M, L), as all other methods.

Further difﬁculties can arise from (2) since it is sensi-
tive to gradients in the ﬁeld proﬁle; noise and wave activity
associated with an observation of a bow shock can make
the measurement of dBL/dt difﬁcult, and traditional ﬁl-
tering techniques do not preserve gradients well. For lami-
nar shocks, a simple variation of the method approximates
the shock ramp proﬁle with a hyperbolic tangent function
along the N direction:

BL =

Bu + Bd
2

+

Bd − Bu
2

tanh

3N
lr

,

(3)

where Bu and Bd refer to the total ﬁeld upstream and
downstream of the shock front, and the coefﬁcient 3 en-
sures that 90% of the magnetic ﬁeld variation occurs
within the ramp, −lr/2 < N < lr/2. In this case, from
(2) one immediately has an expression for the ramp width:

lr = 1.5lW

Bd − Bu
BM,max

.

(4)

This approach requires accurate measurements of Bu and
Bd, but is less sensitive to the local BL gradient than the
direct application of (2) to an observed shock proﬁle.

A Sample Bow Shock

In the present section we apply the proposed method
to a quasi-perpendicular collisionless shock crossing that
was observed by the ISEE-1 and -2 spacecraft on Novem-
ber 26, 1977, 06:10 UT. The magnetic proﬁle of this shock
was measured by the ISEE-1 and -2 UCLA ﬂuxgate mag-
netometers [Russell, 1978]. Data is ﬁltered to obey the
Nyquist criterion and then sampled at the rate of 16 vec-
tors per second. By averaging over a minute of data up-
stream and downstream of the shock front and applying
the coplanarity theorem, the shock normal is determined,
and the angle between the shock normal and the upstream
magnetic ﬁeld is found to be θBN = 67◦. Figure 1 shows
the high-resolution ISEE-1 observation of total magnetic
ﬁeld and its three components (BN , BM , BL), rotated into
coplanar coordinates.

Figure 1. The magnetic proﬁle in the coplanar frame for
a laminar shock observed by ISEE-1 on November 26,
1977. MA = 2.7, β = 0.52, and θBn = 67.0◦.

Figure 2. The magnetic proﬁle of the shock, with short
period noise removed using a wavelet ﬁlter (Daubechies,
10 wavelet with the 6 ﬁnest scales removed).

Plasma measurements of the upstream solar wind are
obtained from the ISEE-1 and ISEE-3 solar wind exper-
iments [Bame et al., 1978], and are used to calculate
the following parameters:
ion inertial length, c/ωpi =
58 km; the Alfv´enic Mach number MA = 2.7 (so that
lW = 8.3 km); and electron and ion beta, βe = 0.36 and
βi = 0.16, respectively.

In order to remove short wavelength noise while main-
taining the gradients within the shock proﬁle, the data was
denoised applying a discrete wavelet transform [see, for
example, Chui, 1992; Donoho, 1993] (using the Daubechies-
10 wavelet) and removing the 6 ﬁnest scales. This approx-
imately corresponds to the removal of scales shorter than
26 = 64 data points, which in turn roughly corresponds
to 4 second averaging for this 1/16 sec.
resolution ob-
servation. Although substantial oscillations persist in the
upstream and downstream regions, the behavior of BM
and BL within the ramp is consistent with the theoretical
prediction, as seen in Figure 2.

Comparison of BM,max with the slope of BL gives
the following shock velocity estimate from the noncopla-
narity: Vsh = 4.4 km/s. Independently, the shock velocity
estimated from the ISEE-1 and ISEE-2 spacecraft separa-
tion is Vsh = 5.7 km/s (separation Ls = 20 km along the
shock normal and ramp crossing time separation of 3.5 s).
The two estimates agree within 50% deviation.

Applying the hyperbolic tangent approximation from
equation (3), the ramp width is estimated to be 47.72 ±
7.5 km. Measuring the ramp based upon two-spacecraft
comparisons, ramp width is found to be 56.7 ± 8.2 km.
(The temporal duration of the ISEE-1 ramp observation

is approximately 10.25 sec.) Uncertainty in both calcu-
lations is primarily dominated by the uncertainty in the
shock normal determination (which is in turn a result in
deviations from the upstream and downstream ﬁeld mea-
surements). These two estimations of ramp width agree
within 20%.

Application to a Variety of Shocks

In order to estimate the reliability of the method out-
lined in the previous section, we compare the results of
the proposed approach from a variety of low-Mach num-
ber shock observations. Table 1 contains relevant parame-
ters for a selection of shocks observed by the ISEE space-
craft: the Alfvenic Mach number (MA), ratio of critical-
ity (Rc), θBN (as determined by coplanarity), total β of
the upstream plasma, the variation of the normal compo-
nent of the magnetic ﬁeld during the observation of the
shock ramp (normalized by the maximum noncoplanar
component in the ramp, ∆BN /BM,max), and the results
from estimating ramp width using equation (3) (lr,pred)
and from the comparison of the ISEE observations (lr,obs).
These shocks were selected for their low-β, low-Mach
number, quasi-perpendicular (θBN > 45◦) characteris-
tics, as well as being observed at times when the ISEE-
1 and -2 spacecraft conﬁgurations were ideal for deter-
mining ﬁne spatial scales (i.e., small spatial and tempo-
ral separations between observations, and θBN ’s calcu-
lated by coplanarity and by using an ellipsoidal model of
the bow shock agree within 10◦). Nearly-perpendicular
shocks (θBN > 80◦) are avoided due to the difﬁculties
of determining the shock normal vectors from coplanarity

son with other shock observations and with theory. Based
upon a sampling of bow shock observations made by the
ISEE-1 and -2 spacecraft, we conclude that this technique
is a satisfactory alternative when two-spacecraft compar-
isons are not feasible, provided that Mach number and
plasma β are low (although not strictly laminar) and the
rotation of the shock proﬁle into the coplanarity plane is
fairly clean.

for such shocks. Also, perpendicular shocks may not have
the same whistler mode structure as shocks with lower
θBN [Newbury and Russell, 1996; Friedman et al., 1990].
Many of these shocks have been examined previously by
Farris et al. [1993].

For six out of seven shocks, agreement between ob-
servations and predictions is very good (within 30%); in
comparison, a study of shock velocities based upon two
spacecraft observations and on estimations of shock foot
length reports agreement within 35% for only half of the
shocks examined [Lottermoser and L¨uhr, 1994]. Also, ob-
servation and prediction using the method outlined in this
paper are comparable even when the shock is no longer
strictly laminar: several of the shocks listed in Table 1 are
slightly supercritical (i.e., the ratio of criticality is greater
than 1) and are associated with a plasma β that isn’t espe-
cially low (β > 0.3).

The shock observed on 79 August 13, 1427 UT is an
exception: equation (3) does not accurately estimate its
ramp width. This can be explained by considering the ef-
fects of turbulence as evidenced in the deviations of the
BN ﬁeld component within the ramp layer. Equation (2)
assumes BN to remain constant throughout the shock ob-
servation, but in reality this is not always so. Two dimen-
sional disturbances and plasma turbulence on the shock
front can obscure the coplanarity rotation. Within the
shock ramp on 79 Aug. 13, ﬂuctuations of BN are on the
order of BM,max, resulting in an under-estimated ramp
width from (3). Even with the somewhat stringent re-
quirements placed on selecting the shocks listed in Table
1, non-stationarity and turbulence are still a factor which
cannot be ignored. In Figure 3, the ratio of observed and
predicted ramp widths are compared with the deviation of
BN (normalized to the maximum BM component). The
shock ramps that agree best with the prediction also have
the most constant BN components, and even a noticeable
deviation in BN can still result in a reasonable estimation
of ramp width. The light data points in Figure 3 corre-
spond to supercritical shocks (Rc > 1).

Conclusions

We have examined the relationship between the non-
coplanar component and gradient of the main component
of the magnetic ﬁeld within the collisionless shock ramp
layer. By estimating the scale size of the ramp width based
upon this relationship and comparing that length with the
temporal duration of a shock ramp observation, the ve-
locity of the shock speed in the spacecraft frame can be
calculated. The observed temporal shock proﬁle can then
be transformed into a spatial frame, suitable for compari-

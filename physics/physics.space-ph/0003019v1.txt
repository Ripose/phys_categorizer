Abstract

The aim of the Swedish-Japanese EISCAT campaign in February 1999 was to mea-
sure the ionospheric parameters inside and outside the auroral arcs. The ion line
radar experiment was optimised to probe the E-region and lower F-region with as
high a speed as possible. Two extra channels were used for the plasma line measure-
ments covering the same altitudes, giving a total of 3 upshifted and 3 downshifted
frequency bands of 25 kHz each. For most of the time the shifted channels were
tuned to 3 (both), 4 (up), 5.5 (down) and 6.5 (both) MHz.

Weak signals are seen whenever the radar is probing the diﬀuse aurora, corre-
sponding to the relatively low plasma frequencies. At times when auroral arcs pass
the radar beam, signiﬁcant increases in return power are observed. Many cases
with simultaneously up and down shifted plasma lines are recorded. In spite of the
rather active environment, the highly optimised measurements enable investigation
of the properties of the plasma lines.

A modiﬁed theoretical incoherent scatter spectrum is used to explain the mea-
surements. The general trend is an upgoing ﬁeld-aligned current in the diﬀuse au-
rora, conﬁrmed with a full ﬁt of the combined ion and plasma line spectra. There
are also cases with strong suprathermal currents indicated by large diﬀerences in
signal strength between up- and downshifted plasma lines.

1 Introduction

The incoherent scatter spectrum consists mainly of two lines, the widely used and
relatively strong ion line and the very weak easily forgotten broadband electron
line. There is also another line present, the plasma line, due to scattering from
high frequency electron waves, namely Langmuir waves. From the downgoing
and upgoing Langmuir waves, two plasma lines can be detected by the radar.
The frequency shift from the transmitted signal is the frequency of the scattered
Langmuir wave plus the Doppler shift caused by electron drift. Plasma lines can
be used to measure the electron drift and hence the line-of-sight electric current.
The problem in ion line analysis with the uncertainty of the radar constant can be
solved by the plasma line frequency determination and when that is done the speed
of measurement can be signiﬁcantly increased by including the plasma line in the
ion line analysis. However, since the frequency of the plasma lines is not known
beforehand, and the frequency is varying with height, it is diﬃcult to measure
them with enough resolution.

There have been a number of reports on plasma line measurements and their
interpretation. Most of them have discussed the frequency shift from the transmit-
ted pulse and the scattering has mainly been from the F-region peak, e.g. Showen
(1979), Kofman et al. (1993) and Nilsson et al. (1996a). The latter two showed
also that the simple formula for the Langmuir wave frequency,

f 2 = f 2

p (1 + 3k2λ2

D) + f 2

c sin2 α

(1)

where fp is the plasma frequency, k the wave number fc the electron gyro frequency,
λD the electron Debye length and α the angle between the scattering wave and

2

the magnetic ﬁeld, is valid to within a few kHz and thus enough to set the radar
system constant. To be able to deduce any electron drifts, or current, out of the
positions of the lines these authors also show that Eq. (1) is not suﬃcient, and it
is necessary to carry out more accurate calculations. Hagfors and Lehtinen (1981)
had also to go to further expansions in deriving the ambient electron temperature
from the plasma lines. The fact that so many reports deal with the F region peak
is due to that the altitude proﬁle of the plasma line frequency according to Eq. (1)
will also show a peak around that height. The measurements can thus be made
relatively easily using rather coarse height resolution but good frequency resolution
and only detect the peak frequency. Measurements using the same strategy, but
at other heights, have been made with a chirped radar by matching the plasma
line frequency gradient and the transmitter frequency gradient (Birkmayer and
Hagfors, 1986; Isham and Hagfors, 1993). This technique allows determination
of the Langmuir frequency with very high frequency resolution, but do not use
the radar optimally, since the chirped pulse cannot be used for anything else than
plasma line measurements.

The enhancement of the plasma lines, which occurs in the presence of suprather-
mal electron ﬂuxes (Perkins and Salpeter, 1965), either photoelectrons or secon-
daries from auroral electrons, has been investigated by Nilsson et al. (1996b),
where they also calculate predictions of plasma line strength for diﬀerent incoher-
ent scatter radars and altitudes. They also show that the power of the plasma line
is rather structured with respect to ambient electron density, depending on ﬁne
structure in the suprathermal distributions due to excitations of diﬀerent atmo-
spheric constituents.

Incoherent scatter plasma lines in auroral are more diﬃcult to measure since the
variations in the plasma parameters are high with large time and spatial gradients.
Reports of auroral plasma lines in the aurora are also more rare, and most of them
are based on too coarse time resolution (Wickwar, 1978; Kofman and Wickwar,
1980; Oran et al., 1981; Valladares et al., 1988), with resolutions ranging from 30
seconds up to 20 minutes. The enhancements over the thermal level were high,
but consistent with what could be expected of model calculations of suprathermal
electron ﬂux. They also tried to calculate currents and electron temperature from
the frequency shifts of the plasma lines but with very large error bars. Kirkwood
et al. (1995) used the EISCAT radar and the ﬁlter bank technique and recorded
much higher intensities of the plasma lines, since they got down to resolutions of 10
seconds, and showed also that the plasma-turbulence model proposed by Mishin
and Schlegel (1994) was not consistent with the data, but could be explained by
reasonable ﬂuxes of suprathermal electrons.

In this paper we present data obtained with the high resolution alternating code
technique (Lehtinen and H¨aggstr¨om, 1987), as was also done for F-region plasma
lines by Guio et al. (1996), with even higher intensities due to the time resolutions
of 5 seconds. An interesting, but at the time of the experiment not realisable
at EISCAT, technique would have been the type of coded long pulses used by
Sulzer and Fejer (1994) for HF-induced plasma lines. From relative strengths
between up- and downshifted lines we detect a general trend of upgoing ﬁeld-
aligned currents in the diﬀuse aurora carried by the suprathermal electrons. We
propose a generalisation of the theoretical incoherent scatter spectrum, to include
multiple electron distributions, and in one example we do a full 7-parameter ﬁt
of the incoherent scatter spectrum, including the enhanced plasma lines assuming
shifted Maxwellian secondary electrons, resulting in the ﬁrst radar measurement
of its ﬂux and an upward current carried by the thermal electrons.

2 Experiment

The measurements we present were collected by the 930 MHz EISCAT UHF in-
coherent scatter radar, with its transmitter located at Ramfjordmoen in Norway

3

(69.6 ◦N, 19.2 ◦E, L=6.2). The signals scattered from the ionosphere were received
at stations in Kiruna, Sweden and Sodankyl¨a, Finland as well as at the transmit-
ting site. General descriptions of the radar facility are given by Folkestad et al.
(1983) and Baron (1984). Local magnetic midnight at Ramfjordmoen is at about
2130 UT. In the Swedish-Japanese EISCAT campaign in February 1999, the aim
was to measure the ionospheric parameters inside and outside the auroral arcs.

For this a 3 channel ion line alternating code (Lehtinen and H¨aggstr¨om, 1987)
experiment, optimised to probe the E-region and lower F-region with as high a
speed as possible, was developed. The 16 bit strong condition alternating code with
bitlengths of 22 µs was used, giving 3 km range resolution, and with a sample rate
of 11 ms the range separations in consecutive spectra were 1.65 km. Fig. 1 shows
the transmission/reception scheme of the ﬁrst 20 ms of the radar cycle. The whole
alternating code sequence takes about 0.3 s to complete. During this period the
incoherent scatter autocorrelation functions (ACF) at the probed heights should
not change signiﬁcantly for the alternating codes to work. In order to keep this
as short as possible, the short pulses, normally used for zerolag estimation, were
dropped and instead a pseudo zero lag, obtained from decoding the power proﬁles
of the diﬀerent codes in the alternating code sequence, was used. Fig. 2 shows
the range-lag ambiguity function for this lag, together with the one for the lag
centred at 22 µs. The range extents are rather similar but the power is, of course,
considerably lower for the pseudo zero lag. Nevertheless, this is taken care of in
the analysis and this lag is rather important in events with high temperatures
giving broad ion line spectra or narrow ACFs. The transmitting frequencies were
chosen to give maximum radiated power for a given high voltage setting.

The monostatic plasma line part of the experiment used two channels covering
the same ranges as the ion line but with 3.3 km range separations between the
spectra. The frequency setup for the experiment, illustrated in Fig. 3, gives the

possibility for 3 upshifted and 3 downshifted bands. For 3 MHz and 6.5 MHz
frequency shifts, both the up- and downshifted plasma lines were measured. In
addition there was a 4 MHz upshifted and a 5.5 MHz downshifted band. The
width of these bands should have been set to match the bit length of the codes
used, 50 kHz, but unfortunately this was not the case and 25 kHz wide ﬁlters
were erroneously used. This gave naturally less signal throughput, and in Fig. 2
the corresponding range/lag ambiguity functions for the plasma line channels are
included for the ﬁrst two lags. The decoding still works, giving just slightly in-
creased unwanted ambiguities, but above all the pseudo zero lag is moved out to
a larger lag value. This fact, with one exception, almost ruled out the possibilities
to measure plasma line spectra because, as will be shown later in this paper, they
are likely to be rather wide, due to large time and height gradients of the plasma
parameters. This lead to use mainly the undecoded zerolag, which after integra-
tion over the diﬀerent codes, almost resembles the shape of a 352 µs (16×22 µs)
long pulse.

The experiment contained a large number of antenna pointings in order to follow
the auroral arcs, but as this day was cloudy over northern Scandinavia the trans-
mitting antenna was kept ﬁxed along the local geomagnetic ﬁeld line. The remote
sites, receiving only ion lines, were monitoring the same pulses as the transmitting
site, and were used to measure the drifts in the F-region, to derive the electric ﬁeld.
Thus, these antennas intersected the transmitted beam at the F-region altitude
giving the best signal, for this day mostly at 170 km.

3 Measurements

3.1 Ion line

The experiment started at 1900 UT on 14 February 1999 and continued until
2300 UT. Fig. 4 shows an overview of the parameters deduced from the ion line
measurements, which were analysed using the on-line integration time, 5 seconds,
in order to be compared to the plasma line data. The analysis was done using
the GUISDAP package (Lehtinen and Huuskonen, 1996), but a correction of 45%
of the radar system constant in package had to be invoked to ﬁt the plasma line
measurements according to Eq. (1). This short integration time was possible due
to the highly optimised mode used, with all the transmitter power concentrated
to the E-region. In range, some integration was done, so that at lower heights 2
range gates were added together and with increasing height the number of gates
added together increases to 15 in the F-region.

There is a rather strong E-region from the start, but no real arcs, and we
interpret this as diﬀuse aurora. The peak electron density shows some variation,
but as time goes the E-region ionisation decreases until 2050 UT, where it is almost
gone. The density peak during this time was at around 120 km altitude and the
lower edge of the E-region at 110 km, but at times the ionisation reaches down to
100 km. At 2050 UT and onwards until 2240 UT the ionosphere above Tromsø
became more active and several auroral arcs passed the beam. Around some of the
arcs there were short-lived enhancements of electric ﬁeld, seen as F-region ion and
E-region electron temperature increases. In the last 10 minutes of the experiment
the arc activity disappeared and again there were diﬀuse aurora. From the ﬁeld
aligned ion drifts it is evident there is a rather strong wave activity in the diﬀuse
aurora until 2050 UT, while it is not so clear in the continuation of the experiment.
The last panel with the inferred electron density from the pseudo zero lag shows
the same features as the ﬁtted density panel but with highest possible resolution
since no height integration is made.

3.2 Plasma line

Since the analysis of the plasma lines was forced to handle the undecoded zerolags
of the alternating codes, it was necessary to analyse their proﬁle shape. Fig. 5
shows how this analysis was performed. From the ﬁtted parameters of the ion
line, electron density and temperature, a proﬁle of the approximate Langmuir
frequency can be calculated using Eq. (1). When probing at ﬁxed frequency,
there will be scattered signal only from heights where the probing and Langmuir
frequencies match each other. The eﬀect of the undecoded zerolag is similar to the
one where a normal long pulse is used, but with a lower signal strength. So, the
proﬁle shape will be a square pulse centred on the corresponding altitude, since
no gating is performed. Because the signal strengths are rather weak compared to
the system temperature, there is a great deal of noise in the proﬁle shape. To be
able to extract the altitude and signal power, a ﬁtting procedure was performed
and the measured plasma line proﬁle was convolved with the pulse shape to have
a triangular shape, in order to get a continuous function with a peak.

The plasma line part of the experiment is overviewed in Fig. 6. The signal
strengths shown should be compared with the UHF system temperature of about
90 K. At ﬁrst glance there is almost nothing in the upshifted part, but a more
careful look shows weak signals between 1940 and 2030 UT and after 2250 UT,
corresponding to the occurrence of diﬀuse aurora. Similar echoes can also be seen
in the downshifted channel, and are due to plasma lines at 3 MHz oﬀset from the
transmitted frequencies. In the downshifted part after 2100 UT, frequent events of
rather strong signals in phase with auroral arcs pass the beam. Most of these are
from the 5.5 MHz shift, but some of them also are due to plasma lines at 6.5 MHz.
Such events are less frequent and for most of them there are also signals in the
upshifted part.

Due to the fact that the same channel is used for several frequencies, there
can be several altitudes that fulﬁll the matching condition between Langmuir and
probing frequency. This complicates the analysis somewhat, and there have to be

several ﬁts with diﬀerent numbers of triangles superposed on each other. Some
examples of this analysis are shown in Fig. 7, from only one plasma line to several
both up- and downshifted lines. Using a lower limit of 2 K signal power, the total
number of 5 second events with enhanced plasma lines for this evening was 256,
and a total of 468 plasma line echoes were detected, divided into 220 on 3 MHz,
19 on 4 MHz, 157 on 5.5 MHz and 72 on 6.5 MHz.

4 Theory

In order to relate the plasma line measurements to physical quantities it is neces-
sary to investigate the spectrum of the incoherent scatter process. The Nyquist
theorem approach, derived in a long series of papers by Dougherty and Farley
(1960, 1963), Farley et al. (1961), Farley (1966) and ﬁnally Swartz and Farley
(1979), arrives at

have as main arguments the collision frequency and magnetic ﬁeld. The same
result was also reached by Rosenbluth and Rostoker (1962), using the dressed
particle approach. In Fig. 8 there is an example of the spectrum, showing clearly
the strong ion line around zero oﬀset frequency and the rather weak plasma lines
at rather large oﬀsets. The plasma lines become enhanced by a photo electron
or auroral electron produced suprathermal electron distribution, and in order to
simulate what this extra distribution does to the spectrum a modiﬁcation to the
formula has to be made. First, a rewriting of Eq. (2) following Swartz (1978) has
to be performed in order to separate the electron and ion contributions to the
spectrum:

f is the frequency shift, Z = q/e, ǫ is the dielectricity and K is the Boltzmann

the zero lag of the corresponding ACF is the raw electron density and the vector
velocity is replaced by the line-of-sight velocity. Using a treatment in analogy
to the ion contribution, it is now possible to rewrite the spectrum to support a
number of Maxwellian electron distributions as

In Fig. 9 the eﬀect on the plasma lines of a suprathermal distribution with a
reasonable density of 107 m−3 and width of 10 eV is shown, being lower than
the ionisation energy for most ions. The plasma lines grow considerable and the
integrated power over the bandwidth used in the experiment becomes comparable
to the power of the ion line. It may also be noted that there is no eﬀect at all seen in
the ion line. Perkins and Salpeter (1965) have shown similar calculations, but when
their method was based on large expansions to allow non-Maxwellian distributions
one can here more directly superpose a few Maxwellian distributions to explain
the measurements and even make ﬁts of the spectra taken to get estimates of the
suprathermal distributions, which is of great importance in auroral measurements.
A consequence of Eq. (7) is that it is also possible to derive the spectrum assuming
currents carried by the suprathermal distribution, since it allows diﬀerent drift
velocities on the various distributions. Indeed, Fig. 10, shows diﬀerential strengths
on the two plasma lines, with upgoing electrons enhancing mainly the downshifted
line and downgoing ones the upshifted line.

5 Discussion

Plasma line measurements in the active auroral ionosphere are not an easy task,
due to the large variations in the ionospheric parameters. The Langmuir frequen-
cies are largely dependent on the ambient electron density, making the line move
considerably as the density changes, which it does on time scales of seconds. More-
over, the density height gradient makes the lines very broad when measured over
a speciﬁc height interval, and at times even broader than the receiver band. A
chirped radar would solve only a part of the problem at the cost of transmitter
power. These complications make it hard to draw any conclusions on the power in

can nevertheless look at the diﬀerent distributions in height and power for the
diﬀerent lines to get an idea of their nature, using the on-line integration time of
5 seconds.

The altitude distributions for the diﬀerent frequencies are shown in Fig. 11.
One must note that the signal levels shown are not corrected for range, as the
scattering volumes are not known, and signals from a higher altitude are in fact
stronger than the corresponding signal from a lower height. It is clearly seen that
the strongest signal is the 5.5 MHz line, followed by 6.5, 4 and 3 MHz. The
altitude distribution shows more or less the expected dependence on range, but
there are some exceptions: In one point at 188 km in the 3 MHz band and for
the 5.5 MHz band the strong values between 130 and 140 km seem to be stronger
than the others, even taking into account the range eﬀect. However, the number
of points are too few to be used as evidence on altitude eﬀects. Most of the echoes
are coming from around 120-150 km altitude and Fig. 12 shows a simulation of
the expected strength of the plasma line for given background electron density.
It shows a peak at around 5.5 MHz and this is also what the experiment shows.
A more realistic suprathermal distribution will decrease the returned power for a
number of frequencies and one should see the ﬁgure as an upper-limit estimate.
Indeed, Nilsson et al. (1996b), have made predictions of the expected strength of
Langmuir waves for diﬀerent heights and carefully derived distributions. These
predictions are in rather good agreement with the present measurements showing
a strong peak between 5 and 6.5 MHz.

The most interesting thing with incoherent plasma lines is, of course, the possi-
bility to derive diﬀerential drifts between ions and electrons, and from these deduce
ionospheric currents. For this, one needs to measure the up- and downshifted lines

simultaneously. Although the time of the measurement for both lines were not
exactly the same in this experiment, the time shifts between them are so small
(3-6 ms) compared to the total cycle time (300 ms) of the codes, that this eﬀect
is of minor importance. In Fig. 13, the strengths and altitudes of the two concur-
rently recorded up- and downshifted plasma lines are shown. In general, there are
stronger up- than downshifted lines for the 3 MHz case, whereas no such trend
can be seen in the 6.5 MHz band. However, there are exceptions to these overall
trends and on occasions there are large diﬀerences in the signal strengths between
the lines. Almost all of the 3 MHz plasma lines were recorded in diﬀuse aurora and
this evident diﬀerence in signal power needs a closer examination. When there is a
drift of the thermal electrons, the plasma lines shift, and when probing at a ﬁxed
frequency, the scatter may not come from the same altitude for the up- and down-
shifted lines respectively. The strength of the plasma line is also rather altitude
dependent due to the damping by the collisions of electrons with ions and neutrals.
But Fig. 13 shows no general height diﬀerence between the up- and downshifted
3 MHz lines, so this diﬀerence in strength cannot be explained by thermal electron
bulk drifts. To simulate the eﬀect of current carried by suprathermal electrons,
Fig. 14 illustrates the strength of the 3 MHz plasma lines for Maxwellian electron
beams of diﬀerent energies. With no net current the lines are of almost the same
strength, and the diﬀerence is mainly dependent on where in the receiver band
the lines are. However the experiment shows stronger upshifted lines, thus it is
evident that diﬀuse aurora this night contained ﬂuxes of downgoing suprathermal
electrons or, in other words, there was an upgoing current carried by suprathermal
electrons. For the 6.5 MHz bands there may be a slight diﬀerence with respect
to the altitude, and that is most likely due to thermal currents causing frequency
shifts of the plasma lines. This eﬀect is not very clear, but as lower heights have
higher density, or Langmuir frequency, and as the downshifted line is at a slightly

15

lower height, this is most probably an eﬀect of a downgoing current carried by
thermal electrons. The correction due to heat-ﬂow in the plasma dispersion func-
tion, discussed by Kofman et al. (1993) and conﬁrmed later also by Nilsson et al.
(1996a) and Guio et al. (1996), but not taken into account here, would also show
the same eﬀect in altitude diﬀerence between the lines. The band widths used
here, 25 kHz, are much wider than the eﬀect of heat-ﬂow, which is less than or
around 1 kHz in the F-region and much lower in the E-region, so that cannot
explain the 6.5 MHz height diﬀerences. A recent paper by Guio et al. (1998) with
proper calculation of the dispersion equation investigates the heat-ﬂow and ﬁnds
that it is not necessary to invoke the eﬀect at all.

All of the above discussions on currents are only on directions of currents, but
to get any quantitative numbers one should look at the spectra themselves. Of
the 256 events of enhanced plasma lines, there is only one that is good enough
to investigate. All the other are too broad either due to the Langmuir frequency
gradient smearing or the fact that the Langmuir frequency is not constant during
the 5 second time slots. Another reason is that the stationarity condition for the
alternating code technique is not fulﬁlled, due to changes of Langmuir frequency,
and the spectra change too much within the 300 ms cycle. Anyway, there is one,
and the up- and downshifted bands, together with the ion line band, are shown
in Fig. 15. The shifts in this case are around 3 MHz as deduced from the ion line
analysis. These spectra were then ﬁtted to the theoretical spectrum in Eq. (7) to
get the ionospheric parameters. At the ﬁrst glance the ﬁt on the ion line seems
rather poor, but the ﬁt was done as usual in the time domain with proper weighting
on the diﬀerent lags of the ACF, and in the FFT process to produce Fig. 15 these

statistical properties are lost. The ﬁt looks actually better in the time domain,
but the frequency domain was chosen in the ﬁgure to be more informative. The
current density j = Nee(vi − ve), and with the ﬁtted parameters, the ﬁeld aligned
current carried by the thermal electrons, amount to 12 µAm−2 upward. This is
consistent with the general current seen in the plasma line strength for the 3 MHz
band. Again, heat-ﬂow is not taken into account, but that should increase the
current somewhat. The deduced suprathermal distribution is in good agreement
with those Kirkwood et al. (1995) derived from the precipitating ﬂux of primaries;
of course in the present case the distribution is Maxwellian and without the ﬁne
structure due to the atmospheric constituents, but the numbers are comparable.

6 Conclusions

We have made measurements of plasma lines in the active auroral E-region. During
256 periods of 5 second integration we found a total of 468 plasma line echoes,
divided into 220 on 3 MHz, 19 on 4 MHz, 157 on 5.5 MHz and 72 on 6.5 MHz. It
may seem strange to try to measure plasma lines at such a low frequency as 3 MHz
giving low signal levels, but in fact most of the echoes and the most interesting
results came from this frequency oﬀset.

The strongest echoes were found at the 5.5 MHz line, and somewhat weaker
ones at 6.5 MHz, inside auroral arcs. One must, however, note that the strength
measured inside the arcs is mostly a low-limit estimate due to the active environ-
ment. The integration period used, 5 s, is rather long in auroral arc conditions,
and changes typically occur on shorter time scales. Therefore, eﬀects of gradients
in the Langmuir frequency proﬁle, and hence scattering volumes, have not been
taken into account.

The Holy Grail in incoherent scatter plasma lines is the possibility to measure

currents, and in this case, the ﬁeld-aligned currents in aurora. The simulations
carried out here, the extended full IS spectrum with multi-Maxwellian distributions
of electrons, show that the strength of the lines is determined by the suprathermal
part of the electron distribution, and the frequency mainly by the thermal part.
For simultaneous up- and downshifted plasma line diﬀerences in intensity we can
deduce currents carried by suprathermals, and for diﬀerences in frequency, currents
carried by thermals.

The simultaneous up- and downshifted frequencies of the 3 MHz line in the
diﬀuse aurora show, on average, an upward ﬁeld-aligned suprathermal current
during the two main periods when they were detected, 1940-2030 UT and 2250-
2300 UT. In the arcs in general, there is an indication of downward thermal current
as seen from the altitudes of the 6.5 MHz echoes. Of course, no rule is without
exceptions, and there are cases where one line is much stronger than the other or
the other line is not at all enhanced, indicating strong currents.

In the full 7-parameter ﬁt of the incoherent scatter spectrum with the ion line
and the both enhanced plasma lines, we obtained a thermal current consistent with
the general suprathermal current for diﬀuse aurora and a reasonable suprathermal
distribution of electrons.

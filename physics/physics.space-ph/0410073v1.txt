Abstract

Recent studies provide evidence for the multi-scale nature of magnetic turbulence in the plasma

sheet. Wavelet methods represent modern time series analysis techniques suitable for the descrip-

tion of statistical characteristics of multi-scale turbulence. Cluster FGM (ﬂuxgate magnetometer)

magnetic ﬁeld high-resolution ( 67 Hz) measurements are studied during an interval in which the

spacecraft are in the plasma sheet. As Cluster passes through diﬀerent plasma regions, physi-

cal processes exhibit non-steady properties on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and small, possibly

kinetic scales. As a consequence, the implementation of wavelet-based techniques becomes compli-

cated due to the statistically transitory properties of magnetic ﬂuctuations and ﬁnite size eﬀects.

Using a supervised multi-scale technique which allows existence test of moments, the robustness

of higher-order statistics is investigated. On this basis the properties of magnetic turbulence are

investigated for changing thickness of the plasma sheet.

INTRODUCTION

Direct observations of the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld in the plasma sheet have revealed

strong intermittent ﬂuctuations in the temporal and spatial domains. These observations

were attributed to turbulence [1]. Eddy turbulence rather than Alfv´enic turbulence seems

to prevail and the most important dissipation mechanisms include a multi-scale cascade of

energy to non-magnetohydrodynamic (non-MHD) scales and an electrical coupling of the

turbulent ﬂows to the ionosphere [2]. In contrast with the classical hydrodynamic or MHD

homogeneous turbulence picture [3, 4], MHD turbulence in the plasma sheet is not free from

boundary eﬀects [2, 5]. Moreover, due to the movement of boundaries (e.g. the plasma

sheet boundary layer (PSBL), or a ﬂow channel built up during rapid plasma ﬂows) and the

transitory character of driving mechanisms (e.g. shear ﬂows, sporadic reconnection, MHD

instabilities), the observed processes show intermittence in time rather than intermittence

in space, an important clue for distinguishing homogeneous and non-homogeneous plasma

sheet ﬂows [6].

Intermittence is related to long-tailed probability distributions, hence to

higher order statistical moments. In general, statistical moments are deﬁned by the average

of the powers of a random variable. In solar wind intermittence studies it is customary to use

q-th order absolute powers of velocity, magnetic ﬁeld, etc. increments (so-called q-th order

structure functions) [7, 8], which allow to investigate the multi-scale scaling features of ﬂuc-

tuations with long-tailed probability distributions. Direct studies of empirical probability

densities of increment ﬁelds in the solar wind revealed departures from a Gaussian distri-

bution over multiple scales [9] and an increase of intermittence towards small scales [10].

Another class of intermittence studies uses large deviation concepts reconstructing distribu-

tion functions of burstiness of local ﬂuctuations in considered ﬁelds [6, 11]. An alternative

for studying multi-scale space plasma intermittence is represented by the wavelet method

[12, 13], which also proved to be useful in resolving multi-scale cascading features of a current

disruption event in the Earth’s plasma sheet [14]. In this paper we investigate magnetic ﬁeld

intermittence using q-th order moments (average of the powers) of wavelet coeﬃcients. In

the following under statistical moments we mean q-th order moments of wavelet coeﬃcients.

To be consistent, we specify the main problems related to the estimation of moments in the

plasma sheet. First of all, a robust estimation of higher-order statistical characteristics of

plasma sheet turbulence requires the processing of long time series, while the recited non-

2

steady features might change the internal structure of the observed turbulence. Contrarily,

if the measurements are limited to too short time intervals, ﬁnite size eﬀects lead to the

divergence of higher order moments, and the description of ﬂuctuations which show large

deviations from a mean value becomes impossible. Additional diﬃculties are introduced by

moment estimators which are not sensitive to the non-existence or divergence of statistical

moments. Under the circumstances, for the proper recognition of the nature of large devi-

ations in turbulence, at least three basic conditions have to be taken into account: 1.) the

motion of PSBL, 2.) the time evolution of the driving and/or dissipation mechanisms and

3.) the number of existing statistical moments. One can detect PSBL motion (e.g. plasma

sheet thinning or thickening) from direct, preferably multi-spacecraft observations [15, 16].

The driving and dissipation mechanisms are obviously dependent on the physical process ex-

amined. In this paper we analyse bursty bulk ﬂow (BBF) associated magnetic ﬂuctuations.

Sporadically occurring BBFs can stir the plasma sheet plasma very eﬃciently, because they

are the carriers of decisive amounts of mass, momentum and magnetic ﬂux [17, 18]. Here

the driver is the plasma ﬂow itself, while the increased small scale power of the magnetic

ﬂuctuations can be used for a proper detection of ongoing dissipation processes. Then a

statistical wavelet-based test ensuring the existence of moments can enhance the reliability

of the intermittence level estimations.

II. WAVELET METHODS

In this paper we will use wavelet methods for the estimation of the power of small scale

magnetic ﬂuctuations, cf , and for the computation and existence test of statistical moments,

as well.

It was shown in Ref. 19 that a semi-parametric wavelet technique, based on a fast

pyramidal algorithm, allows unbiased estimations of the scaling parameters cf and α in the
scaling relation for power spectral density P (f ) ∼ cf f −α, where cf is a nonzero constant.

The algorithm consists of several steps. First, a discrete wavelet transform of the time series

X(t) is performed over a dyadic grid (scale, time) = (2j, 2jt) and j, t ∈ N. Then, at each

octave j = log22j, the variance µj of the discrete wavelet coeﬃcients dx(j, t) is computed

3

µj =

x(j, t) ∼ 2jα cf

where nj is the number of coeﬃcients at octave j. Finally, from Equation (1) α and cf can
be estimated by constructing a plot of yj ≡ log2µj versus j (logscale diagram) and by using

a weighted linear regression over the region (jmin, jmax) where yj is assumed to be a straight

through:

line.

Generalizing Equation (1), for a class of multifractal processes, the so-called partition

function can be introduced through the q-th order moments of the wavelet coeﬃcients [19]:

The partition function measures not only the scaling of the moments, but also the higher

order dependencies of the wavelet coeﬃcients. When ζ(q) is plotted against q together with

95% conﬁdence intervals of the mean ζ(q) (multiscale diagram), self-similar (fractal) and

multifractal processes can be distinguished [19]. A nonlinear ζ(q) is a signature of multifrac-

tal scaling and small scale intermittence. However, the wavelet estimator may yield ﬁnite
values for µq

j even in situations when a q-th order moment does not exist or diverges. This

can happen when the higher order dependencies of the estimator rather than the true scaling

of the moments are observed over a range of scales. The bias introduced by the estimator

may prevent us from discriminating between monofractal and multifractal processes, because

of the false nonlinear dependence of ζ(q) on q. In order to deduce the proper support of the

partition function, (qmin, qmax), over which all the moments exist and are ﬁnite, a simple

method based on characteristic functions was proposed [20]. Here we shortly summarize

this method. The empirical characteristic function for the time series Xn (n = 1, ..., N) is
computed as F (u) = N −1
Pn eiuXn. It represents the Fourier transform of the probability
distribution of X. It has been proven that F has as many continuous derivatives at u = 0

as the probability distribution of X has ﬁnite positive integer moments.The generalization

of the local integer degree of diﬀerentiability to real-valued degrees of diﬀerentiability is

possible using the concept of H¨older regularity. The H¨older regularity of F at the origin

(u = 0) controls the number of existing real-valued moments while qmax ≤ 2. Only an

averaged regularity of F around the origin is ensured to exist for moments exceeding 2 [21].

It introduces limitations to the testing procedure of existing moments larger than 2. It is

possible, however, even in this case to estimate the lower and upper limit for the largest

4

existing positive moment qmax [20]. Since the wavelet transform, using a wavelet ψ with

vanishing moments Mψ, is well suited for estimating the H¨older regularity [22], F is wavelet

transformed, and only the wavelet coeﬃcients at the origin dF (s, u = 0) are considered fur-

ther. Here instead of j the notation s is used for describing the characteristic scales of F .

The number of vanishing moments Mψ allows us to cancel or decrease the eﬀects of linear or

polynomial trends and ensures that the wavelet details are well deﬁned. This is because a

wavelet with Mψ vanishing moments is orthogonal to the polynomials of degree Mψ − 1 and

the wavelet transform acts as a multiscale diﬀerential operator of order Mψ [22]. The H¨older

regularity of a signal can be estimated by wavelets with vanishing moments exceeding that

H¨older regularity by at least 1. Then the H¨older regularity of F can be estimated from the

decay of the wavelet coeﬃcients across the scales. It allows to estimate qmax from a linear

regression of log2dF (s, u = 0) versus s. The largest existing negative moment qmin can be
estimated by applying the same procedure as above, but for the inverse variable X −1 [20].

Further diﬃculties arise with ﬁnding the proper scales s over which the H¨older regularity of

F can be evaluated. We will demonstrate that three diﬀerent scaling ranges of F appear.

One of them reﬂects the scaling properties of the chosen wavelet, and therefore the observed

scaling over that range is not related to the pysical process itself. This scaling range can

be easily identiﬁed by changing the basic feature of the analysing wavelet: the number of

vanishing moments Mψ. To this end an appropriate wavelet has to be chosen which allows

changing Mψ. In this paper we use m-th order derivatives of the Gaussian wavelet which

have m vanishing moments. The remaining two scaling ranges reﬂect a symmetry property

of the estimator. An exchange of the time series X by X −1 results in a mirroring of the

scaling regimes with respect to the characteristic scale which separates the tail from the

body of the underlying distribution function. This symmetry feature of the estimator allows

us to obtain both qmin and qmax at once, evaluating only the scaling properties of the char-

acteristic function for the time series X [20]. We will consider further details of this method

later.

III. BBF ASSOCIATED MAGNETIC TURBULENCE ON JULY 30, 2002

A. Event overview

In this paper we analyse burst mode (67 Hz) magnetic data from the Cluster ﬂuxgate

magnetometer (FGM) [23] during the interval 1730-1900 UT on July 30, 2002, when the

Cluster (C) spacecraft were at the GSM (Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric) position (-16,

-11, 2)RE. The GSM coordinate system will be used throughout the paper, in which the x

axis is deﬁned along the line connecting the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth.

The origin is deﬁned at the center of the Earth and is positive towards the Sun. Figure 1a

shows the BX component from C 1,3. From 1730 to 1740 UT both spacecraft are in the lobe
(BX ∼ 30 nT). After 1740 UT the spacecraft approach the neutral sheet (BX → 0) where

they remain until almost 1900 UT. The BZ component from C1,3 is depicted in Figure 1b

together with a dashed line at the top indicating the occurrence of intermittent groups of

BBF events. During the ﬁrst half of the interval the velocity of the plasma ﬂow increases

up to 1500 km/s (not shown). BBFs drive the magnetic ﬂuctuations of both BX and BZ

components and cause a clear dipolarization of the magnetic ﬁeld (increase of BZ) at the

beginning. Figure 1c shows the time evolution of the power of the BZ ﬂuctuations, cf (BZ),

which is estimated through Equation 1, in the logscale diagram, at the scale j = 4 (∼ 0.33

s). cf (BZ) is estimated within sliding overlapping windows of width 61 s with a time shift

4 s. All the variations of cf (BZ) are relative enhacements to the lobe values which are

normalized to 1. In this way cf (BZ) represents a way of quantifying the relative power of

the ﬂuctuations at a given scale. In the following we restrict our analysis to the subintervals

A and B, depicted in Figure 1c. During interval A, cf (BZ) ﬂuctuates intermittently on

both C1 and C3. The diﬀerence in BX measured at the locations of C1 and 3 changes

substantially, indicating spatial gradient lengths of the order of the distance between the

spacecraft. C1 and C3 are in opposite hemispheres in a distance ∼ 4000 km before 1800

UT. The vertical position to the current sheet allows to use C1, C3 magnetic observations

for rough estimation of the inﬂuence of PSBL. At the beginning of the interval A, BX

decreases from ∼ 20 nT to ∼ 0 nT showing large ﬂuctuations about the mean value. After

1752 UT the ﬂuctuations achieve ∼ −20 nT. Both the large ﬂuctuations and the values

close to −20, +20 nT indicate that the magnetic ﬂuctuations during the interval A might

6

be inﬂuenced by the PSBL. From the decreasing gradients after 1800 UT, we deduce that,

the plasma sheet gradually becomes thicker. Both spacecraft stay closer to the neutral sheet

and the amplitude of ﬂuctuations is also considerably smaller. Therefore, the inﬂuence of

the PSBL on turbulence characteristics might be weaker during the interval B. We will

compare the higher-order statistical characteristics during the two intervals using magnetic

data from C3. However, before that, the proper support of the partition function (Eq. 2)

has to be evaluated.

B. Scaling of the characteristic function

Figure 2 shows the scaling properties of F computed for the BZ component on C3 during

period A. The continuous line corresponds to the estimated dependence of dF on s at

the origin in the log-log plot. The dashed-dotted lines show diﬀerent scaling regimes. The

interpretation follows the way proposed in Ref. 20. The maximum variance of F is controlled

by the maximum value of BZ. When the analysing scales go below smin ∼ 1/max(BZ),

the characteristic function is oversampled in the vicinity of the origin. Below smin, the

regularity of the analysing wavelet is observed. Therefore it shows a scaling ∼ sMψ , which is

diﬀerent from the scaling of F . The maximum scale, smax, which separates the tail from the

body of the underlying distribution function, can be found experimentally. For the scales

s >> smax the same scaling is observed as would have been obtained, if we had analysed
a random variable B−1
Z instead of BZ. Figure 2 shows that for log2s > −3, dF scales as
∼ sρ−
, therefore for the negative moments qmin = ρ−. Between the scales (smin, smax),
the characteristic function scales as sρ+
. The estimated values are ρ− ∼ −1.0 ± 0.1 and
ρ+ ∼ 2.2 ± 0.1. For period B, ρ− ∼ −1.0 ± 0.1 and ρ+ ∼ 2.4 ± 0.1 (not shown). In both cases

the scaling exponent ρ+ is larger than 2. In such a case the conditions for existing moments

can be formulated in terms of an averaged H¨older regularity of F at the origin. To be able

to detect the lower and upper bounds for an unknown average regularity, the number of

vanishing moments (Mψ) of the analysing wavelet has to be successively increased. First a

low regularity wavelet can be chosen, e.g. the second derivative of the Gaussian wavelet.

When the scaling exponent ρ+ is equal or larger than 2, as in our case above, we can increase

Mψ until ρ+ will achieve Mψ between the scales (smin, smax). It has been shown that when
ρ+ ∼ Mψ is obtained, ρ+ < qmax < ρ+ + 1 [20]. On this basis ζ(q) can be computed

7

over the support (qmin, qmax) = (−1, 3). The same computations for the BX component
of the magnetic ﬁeld also give qmin ∼ −1. Because of the small separation between smin

and smax, however, it is not so straightforward to estimate qmax for BX. Our estimation
based on linear regression for diﬀerent Mqs is qmax = 1.5 ± 0.5. In what follows, the support
(qmin, qmax) = (−1, 3) will be used for both BX and BZ, having in mind that the estimate

of ζ(q, BX) is less reliable for q > 2.

C. Scaling of the moments

The dependence of ζ(q) on q ∈ (qmin, qmax) for BX and BZ estimated over two diﬀerent
range of scales during interval A is depicted in Figure 3. The large time scales 0.67 − 5.4 s,

correspond to spatial scales of 670 − 5400 km, assuming 1000 km/s plasma ﬂow velocities.

The smaller value is of the order of the proton gyroradius in the plasma sheet, while the

larger value is limited by the length of the intervals chosen. These values represent the

lower end of the scale range of the MHD regime in turbulence. Similarly, the small time

scales 0.08 − 0.33 s correspond to spatial scales 80 − 330 km where non-MHD dissipation

and damping processes are non-negligible [2]. For what follows we will use the subscripts

’ss’ for small scales and ’ls’ for large scales. Except for ζss(q > 0.5, BX), ζ(q) exhibits

linear dependence in the multiscale diagram (Figure 3). ζss(q, BX) is close to that linear

dependence within q ∈ (−1, 0.5).

Figure 4 shows the scaling of moments during interval B. ζls(q) remains approximately

linear for both BX and BZ.
diﬀerent, ζss(q, BX) ∼ 0 for each q.

In comparison with interval A, the small scale behavior is

In this case, the partition function (Eq.2) does not

represent the eﬀects of intermittence adequately, because of the ﬂat power spectrum with

a spectral index α = ζss(q = 2, BX) + 1 ∼ 1 [24]. In contrast, ζss(q < 2, BZ) follows the

straight line ζ(q) = q/3, which describes the scaling in homogeneous Kolmogorov model of

turbulence. However, ζss(q > 2, BZ) becomes undistinguishable from the large scale scalings

(within the conﬁdence intervals). This behavior indicates a weak multifractality in small

scale vertical ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld. Here, two additional points have to be

clariﬁed. First, in this paper we used magnetic ﬁeld time series, therefore, when interpeting

the observed scalings in terms of turbulence models, we have to suppose the validity of the

Taylor frozen ﬁeld hypothesis. In the plasma sheet the Taylor hypothesis is expected to be

8

valid during fast BBFs [25]. In our case plasma ﬂow velocities achieve ∼ 1500 km/s during

the chosen intervals and the validity of the frozen ﬁeld hypothesis seems to be substantiated.

Second, instead of the velocity measurements, which are used in phenomenological models of

hydrodynamic turbulence, we have magnetic ﬁeld measurements, therefore the interpretation

of ζss(q, BZ) in terms of Kolmogorov scaling might be diﬃcult. Kolmogorov turbulence is

completely described by its velocity ﬁeld. If a passive scalar ﬁeld is subject to Kolmogorov

turbulence, the resulting scaling of the passive scalar ﬁeld is also Kolmogorov [26]. The

small scale weak magnetic ﬁeld in the plasma sheet can be moved as a passive scalar and its

scaling then resembles that of the velocity ﬁeld. During the chosen intervals A and B, the

small scale magnitude of the ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld is a few nT, while the small scale

velocity ﬂuctuations achieve 500 km/s.

The signiﬁcant diﬀerence between ζss(q, BX) and ζss(q, BZ) indicates that the small scale

ﬂuctuations appear to be anisotropic. To check this we plotted the time evolution of the

relative power cf r = cf (BZ)/cf (BX) at scales 0.08 s and 5.4 s in Figure 5. cf r was computed

in the same way as cf in Figure 1, using sliding overlapping windows. While the large scale

(5.4 s) relative power of the BZ and BX ﬂuctuations is close to one during the intervals A

and B, the small scale (0.08 s) relative power shows signiﬁcant enhancements. It means that

magnetic ﬂuctuations are excited preferentially in vertical direction during the intervals

A and B. Outside of A and B the small scale power of the BX and BZ ﬂuctuations is

comparable. Large scale magnetic ﬂuctuations exhibit more power in BX than BZ also

outside the intervals A and B. These features show that the observed anisotropy is scale

dependent and the occurrence of BBFs can modify the preferable direction of ﬂuctuations.

In summary, the main diﬀerence between the intervals A and B is that small-scale mag-

netic ﬂuctuations are less homogeneous during the interval B. Turbulence characteristics

were expected to be inﬂuenced by the PSBL in A. Here the magnetic ﬂuctuations can be

more homogeneous due to an eﬀective mixing of the plasma. The mixing length (ML)

in the turbulent plasma sheet can be computed as the product of the integral time scale

and the average root-mean-square velocity of turbulent ﬂows, giving ML ∼ 10000 km [1].

ML is of the order of the average distance that turbulent eddies can travel before colliding

with each other. In Prandtl’s mixing length theory [27] an eﬀective viscosity is introduced

which is proportional to ML2 multiplied by the absolute value of the local velocity gradient.

The velocity gradients are of the same order during A and B (not shown). However, ML

9

is position dependent. For turbulence close to a boundary, ML rapidly decreases, which

makes the mixing of plasma more eﬀective. Since the plasma sheet is thinner in A and

thicker in B, ML should be shorter in A than in B. Nevertheless, the large scale scaling

exhibits the same homogeneity in both A and B. The spectral index can be estimated as

[24] αls = ζls(q = 2) + 1 ∼ 2.7 ± 0.7. Similar values were obtained in Ref. 5. Interestingly,
in wall-bounded turbulent shear ﬂows α ∼ 1.6 − 2.2 is found [28]. We think that the longer

ML led to the observed small scale anisotropy and weak multifractality during the interval

B.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Much of our recent knowledge about solar wind turbulence comes from both spectral

and non-Gaussian (higher order statistical) properties of multiscale ﬂuctuations. It is well

understandable, since the available range of MHD scales of ﬂuctations in the solar wind

embraces more than six decades of wave number space. In contrast, the range of available

MHD scales in the plasma sheet spans over less than two decades [2]. In solar wind studies,

depending on the length of the time series, moments (q-th order structure functions) up

to q = 20 were computed [8]. Similar studies were not accomplished for plasma sheet

turbulence.

In this paper we demostrated that a proper study of the turbulence in the plasma

sheet requires a thorough knowledge of the underlying non-steady physical conditions which

can strongly inﬂuence the estimation of the turbulence characteristics. We studied BBF-

associated magnetic ﬂuctuations under conditions that allowed to consider the changing

plasma sheet thickness and ﬁnite size eﬀects. Using unsupervised methods, ﬁnite size eﬀects

can lead to spurious estimations of the scaling characteristics in turbulence. A possible

solution of this problem comes from the study of the scaling features of the empirical char-

acteristic function at the origin. We have shown that, at least for the analysed events,

statistical moments can at best be computed for q ∈ (−1, 3). So, the range of the available

statistical moments is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that in the solar wind.

In spite of the restricted range, we have found that when the plasma sheet is thinner

(Interval A), boundary eﬀects lead to the shortening of the mixing length. The plasma is

mixed more eﬃciently, and the small scale ﬂuctuations become more homogeneous. The large

10

scale magnetic ﬂuctuations are not sensitive to the changes of the plasma sheet thickness.

Both BBF-associated intervals exhibit the same large scale scaling characteristics in the

multiscale diagram similar to wall-bounded turbulent shear ﬂows.

We have shown that non-homogeneous magnetic turbulence and a weak multifractality

(nonlinear dependence of ζ(q) on q in multiscale diagram) develops in the vertical direction

at small scales (0.08-0.33 s), when the ﬂuctuations occur in a thick plasma sheet (Interval B),

far from the PSBL. Though the multifractal signatures are indicative of an inhomogeneous

energy transfer through a turbulent cascade, a model of intermittent turbulence (e.g. the

P-model) cannot be ﬁtted to the nonlinear ζ(q), because in such a model ζ(q = 3) = 1 is

expected [29]. In our case, however, ζ(q = 3) >> 1.

BBF associated magnetic ﬂuctuations exhibit multi-scale anisotropy features which are

diﬀerent from non-BBF periods. The small scale scaling characteristics of BX and BZ

ﬂuctuations have found to be anisotropic in the multiscale diagrams. The occurence of

scale dependent anisotropy is evident from the comparison of the relative power of BZ and

BX magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations over two diﬀerent scales (0.08 and 5.4 s). Scale dependent

anisotropy can robustly appear in MHD ﬂuids in the presence of a local mean magnetic ﬁeld

[4], but other mechanisms, e.g. velocity shears can also produce strong anisotropies [30].

A wider statistical study is needed, however, to explore fully the inﬂuence of the PSBL

on magnetic turbulence and the appearance of anisotropy in the plasma sheet.

FIG. 1: Magnetic ﬁeld measurements on Cluster 1 and 3; a. BX components; b. BZ

components; c. Small scale power of BZ ﬂuctuations.

FIG. 2: Scaling of the characteristic function (continuous line); the observed scaling

regimes (dashed-dotted lines); the exponent ρ+ corresponds to the number of positive

moments, ρ− corresponds to the number of negative moments.

FIG. 3: Multiscale diagram - scaling of the moments is depicted for BX and BZ

components at two diﬀerent scale ranges within the interval A.

FIG. 4: Multiscale diagram - scaling of the moments is depicted for BX and BZ

components at two diﬀerent scale ranges within the interval B.

FIG. 5: Scale dependent anisotropy visible in time evolution of the relative power

cf r = cf (BZ)/cf (BX).

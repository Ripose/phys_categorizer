Abstract

The chaotic interaction between electrons and whistler mode waves has been
shown to provide a mechanism for enhanced diﬀusion in phase space. Pitch
angle diﬀusion is relevant for the scattering of electrons into the loss cones,
thus providing a source for auroral precipitating electrons. A single whistler
mode wave propagating parallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld has reso-
nance with the electrons but the process is not stochastic. The presence of a
second, oppositely directed whistler wave has been shown previously to intro-
duce stochasticity into the system, thus enhancing phase space diﬀusion. Here
we generalise previous work to include relativistic eﬀects. The full relativistic
Lorentz equations are solved numerically to permit application to a more ex-
tensive parameter space. We consider parameters scaled to intrinsic planetary
magnetospheres, for electron populations with ’pancake’ velocity distributions
i.e. large anisotropies in velocity space. We show that the diﬀusion is rapid,
occuring on timescales of the order of tens of electron gyroperiods, and is
strongly sensitive to the wave amplitude, the wave frequency and the perpen-
dicular velocity. Using Voyager 1 data we give an estimate of the whistler
wave amplitude in the Io torus at Jupiter and show that the two whistler
mechanism produces pitch angle diﬀusion of up to ±10◦ from an initial pan-
cake distribution, on millisecond timescales.

INTRODUCTION

The electron-whistler interaction has been considered as potential mechanism for pitch
angle scattering in planetary magnetospheres. Gyroresonance processes with near parallel
propagating whister waves have been considered (e.g. [1], [2]), although the process that
they considered is not stochastic and requires a spectrum of frequencies to eﬃciently scatter
electrons into the loss cone [3].

Whistler waves are able to resonate with electrons over a broad energy range, from less
than 100 keV to several MeV [4].
In particular the Hamiltonian has been obtained for
relativistic electrons interacting with a whistler mode wave of single ˆk, revealing underlying
behaviour that is dynamically simple [5].

Stochasticity has been introduced by coupling the bounce motion of the trapped electrons
with a single whistler [6], whilst the presence of a second, oppositely directed whistler wave
was shown from the non-relativistic equations of motion to introduce stochasticity into
the system and was demonstrated numerically for a wave frequency of half the electron
gyrofrequency [7]. This mechanism has been shown to exist in self-consistent simulations
[8].

In this paper we generalise the work in [7] to consider a range of wave frequencies below
the gyrofrequency and include relativistic eﬀects. We consider the eﬃciency of the mecha-
nism in scattering electrons with a high anisotropy in velocity space V⊥ > Vk i.e. a ’pancake’
distribution. Recent plasma density models have shown that anisotropic distributions are
required to ﬁt the observed whistler dispersions in the Jovian magnetosphere [9]. We investi-
gate the dependence of the degree of stochasticity of the system (using Lyapunov exponents)
on the wave amplitude, wave frequency and perpendicular velocity.

EQUATIONS OF MOTION

We consider a total magnetic ﬁeld of the form

B = B0 + B+

ω + B−
ω

where B0 = B0ˆx is the background magnetic ﬁeld and B+
ω are the whistler waves
propagating parallel and anti-parallel to the background ﬁeld respectively (for coordinate
system see Figure 1). We assume that the background ﬁeld lines are uniform, since, as we
will see, the interaction is suﬃciently fast so that changes in the background ﬁeld experienced
by the electrons are small, e.g., for electrons close to Jupiter’s magnetic equator at 6RJ , the
ﬁeld changes by less than 1% for an MeV electron travelling at 0.9c and interacting with
the ﬁeld for 1000 electron gyroperiods (0.1s).

ω and B−

The waveﬁelds B+

ω=Bω[cos(kx − ωt)ˆy − sin(kx − ωt)ˆz]
ω=Bω[cos(−kx − ωt + θ)ˆy − sin(−kx − ωt + θ)ˆz]

with ˆx parallel to the background ﬁeld and ˆy and ˆz perpendicular. The wave frequency, ω,
and wave number, k, are given by the whistler mode dispersion relation:

k2c2
ω2 = 1 −

ω2
pe
ω(ω − Ωe)

ω − k · vr = nΩe/γ

where ωpe is the plasma oscillation frequency and Ωe is the electron gyrofrequency. Electrons
travelling at the correct parallel velocity will experience a constant ﬁeld and will interact
strongly with it. This resonance velocity, vr = vrˆx is given by the resonance condition:

where n is an integer, and γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2
is the relativisic factor . The corresponding
electric ﬁeld is obtained from Maxwell’s relation for plane propagating waves, kEω = ωˆk∧Bω
and the dispersion relation (1).

We write v = vk ˆx + v⊥ cos φ ˆy + v⊥ sin φ ˆz, where φ = φ(t) is the phase of the perpen-
dicular velocity and deﬁne the phase angles ψ1 = kx − ωt + φ and ψ2 = −kx − ωt + φ + θ
as the angles between the perpendicular velocity and B+

ω respectivley.

Reduced Equations

The full relativistic equations can be reduced in the limit of small wave amplitudes. We
introduce two variables Θ = (ψ1 − ψ2)/2 and s = (ψ1 + ψ2)/2 which in the limit of small
b are proportional to the distance along the background ﬁeld, x, and time, t. For small
perturbations in vk we have vk/v⊥ ≈ b << 1 and then to ﬁrst order in b, we have:

Thus we have a double pendulum equation with variables ˙Θ = vk/vr and Θ = kx.
Perturbations in Θ = kx are thus proportional to the wave amplitude, b, to 1/γ and to
the ratio of perpendicular velocity to the square of the resonance velocity. For relativistic
velocities and for large anisotropy (v⊥ >> vk), the constant a << 1.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

Figure 2 shows numerical solutions of the full equations of motion. The plots are stro-
boscopic surfaces of section [10] constructed from cut-planes where x = (n + 1/2)π/k, to
sample the full electron phase space. The initial parallel velocity, vk, was varied over the
range [−vr, vr], where vr is the resonance velocity, given by the resonance condition (2).

All electrons were given the same initial perpendicular velocity, v⊥, with v⊥ = 0.7c
(v⊥/vr ≈ 20), and phase angle, ψ (deﬁned as the angle between the perpendicular velocity
and the ﬁrst whistler wave B+
ω , see Figure 1) to give a pancake velocity distribution with
high initial pitch angles.

For low wave amplitudes, Figure 2 a) the trajectories are essentially regular and char-
acterised by two sets of resonances. As the wave amplitude is increased in Figures 2 b)
and 2 c) stochastic eﬀects are introduced into the region between the two resonances. For
higher wave amplitudes, Figure 2 d), the system becomes globally stochastic with regular
trajectories conﬁned to KAM surfaces close to the resonances. There is signiﬁcant diﬀusion
of electrons throughout phase space, i.e. electrons with low parallel velocities can diﬀuse
through phase space to regions of higher parallel velocity and undergo a signiﬁcant reduction
in pitch angle.

In Figures 2 b)–d) the stochastic regions are bounded with upper and lower parallel
velocity limits. These corresponds to the ﬁrst untrapped electron orbit, which is regular,
and bounds the stochastic region occupied by the orbits of trapped particles. Stochastic
electrons that diﬀuse through phase space to this maximum (minimum) parallel velocity
will have lowest (highest) pitch angles.

In Figure 3 we show a sequence of phase plots for increasing perpendicular velocity. The
reduced equation (Equation 10) describes pendulum like behaviour with oscillations in vk
proportional to both the wave amplitude and the ratio v⊥/v2
r . The resonance condition
(Equation 2) shows that vr = vr(γ(v⊥, vk), k, ω), therefore (for vk << v⊥) vr in addition to
the total electron energy, E, is a functions of the perpendicular velocity. By varying v⊥ only
we can consider the dependence of the degree of stochasticity on v⊥, E and v⊥/v2
r .

4

In Figures 3 a) and b) the perpendicular velocity increases to relativistic velocities v⊥=
0.3–0.6c (Energy 0.02–0.1 MeV). From the resonance condition (2) we see that increasing
v⊥ increases γ and hence reduces vr and the separation between the two resonances. Hence
increasing v⊥ increases the ratio v⊥/v2
r and we see an increase in the stochasticity in the
system as expected from the reduced equations.

In Figure 3 c) where v⊥ = 0.88c (E=0.4 MeV) the resonance condition (2) is satisﬁed for
vr = 0, consistent with maximal stochasticity from the reduced equation (10) as v⊥/v2
→ ∞.
r
Increasing v⊥ further causes the resonances to pass through the vk = 0 line and change sign.
In Figure 3 d) and e) we have v⊥ = 0.97–0.98c (E=1–1.25 MeV). The resonance velocity now
increases with v⊥, therefore the ratio v⊥/v2
r decreases with v⊥. The degree of stochasticity
decreases, until the system is no longer stochastic again (Figure 3 f)) with v⊥ = 0.99c
(E=1.75 MeV).

The dependence, and in particular, the presence of a peak in the degree of stochasticity
r is a relativistic eﬀect. For non relativistic velocities γ is constant and the

on the ratio v⊥/v2
degree of stochasticity continually increases with v⊥ [7].

Lyapunov Exponents

Lyapunov exponents are used to quantify the degree of stochasticity in the system. The
Lyapunov exponents are calculated using the method described in [11]. All six Lyapunov
exponents were calculated over phase space and evolved to their asymptotic limit. The only
signiﬁcant Lyapunov exponent corresponds to spacial perturbations along the background
ﬁeld.

For positive Lyapunov exponents, two trajectories that are initially close together will
diverge exponentially in time. For negative or zero Lyapunov exponents, two trajectories
that are initially close together will remain close together. Positive (negative) Lyapunov
exponents correspond to stochastic (regular) trajectories in phase space.

In the top panel of Figure 4 the Lyapunov exponents are shown for the same initial
conditions as Figure 2 d): electrons have phase angle, ψ = 0, and parallel velocity in the
range [−vr, vr]. Trajectories in the chaotic region of Figure 2 d) have positive Lyapunov
exponent while the Lyapunov exponent of the regular trajectories close to the resonances is
zero.

In the middle panel of Figure 4 we plot the averaged Lyapunov exponent for increasing
perpendicular velocities. The Lyapunov exponents have a dependence on the ratio v⊥/v2
r ;
the Lyapunov exponents increase with v⊥ (v⊥/v2
r increasing) until v⊥ satisﬁes the resonance
equation for vr = 0, (v⊥ = 0.88c), and v⊥/v2
r → ∞. As v⊥ increases further the Lyapunov
exponents decrease (v⊥/v2

r decreasing).

In the bottom panel of Figure 4 we plot the averaged Lyapunov exponent as a function of
the corrected wave frequency, ωc = ω/γΩe. The Lyapunov exponent, and hence the degree
of stochasticity varies strongly with frequency and appears to be enhanced when ωc = m/n,
where m, n = 2, 3, 4, ... It then follows that close to these frequencies the process may be the
most eﬃcient in pitch angle scattering.

ESTIMATION OF WHISTLER WAVE AMPLITUDES.

We use the analysis of Voyager 1 data in [12] and [13] to estimate the whistler wave
amplitude. The plasma wave instrument on Voyager 1 measures the electric ﬁeld spectral
density of the whistler waves over a set of frequency channels of ﬁnite width ∆ωm. To
estimate the wave amplitude we consider two possibilities. The minimum amplitude estimate
is obtained if we assume the wave amplitude is constant over the bandwidth, ∆ωm, of the
measurement giving an estimate of order b = Bω/B0 = 0.0005. This is too low to give
signiﬁcant stochastic diﬀusion, and the changes in pitch angle are small, of the order of less
than 1◦.

The optimum amplitude estimate for this process is obtained if we assume the majority
of the wave power comes from a ﬁnite waveband smaller than that of the instrument. We
consider the case where wavepower is enhanced at frequencies coincident with maxima in
the Lyapunov exponents:
in Figure 4 we see that the Lyapunov exponent is increased
when ωc = ω/γΩe = m/n. The enhancement in the Lyapunov exponent occurs over a
narrow frequency range of order Ωe/100 (see Figure 4). If we assume the that the measured
wavepower occurs in this bandwidth we obtain an electric wave amplitude of the order of
0.02mV m−1 corresponding to a magnetic wave amplitude of 1.5nT , giving b = 0.005, which
is well into strong stochastic diﬀusion regime (see Figure 2).

We obtain a similar estimate using data from Ulysses at the Jovian magnetopause [14],
[15]. To uniquely determine whether or not this process is signiﬁcant, wave amplitude,
rather than spectral density measurements are needed. In this context it interesting to note
that for the Earth, direct amplitude measurements [16] and the extrema of spectral density
measurements [17] yield whistler amplitudes suﬃcient for stochasticity by this mechanism;
whereas average spectral density measurements do not [18]. This is suggestive that the
process will be active under certain conditions only.

Pitch Angle Diﬀusion in the Io torus at Jupiter

Using the estimated wave amplitude we can estimate the rate of diﬀusion from an initial
pancake distribution of electrons. For the Io torus at Jupiter we have a gyrofrequency
Ωe = 53.2kHz, corresponding to a background ﬁeld of 302nT , and a plasma frequency
ωpe = 355kHz (see [12] and [13]).

In Figures 5 and 6 we show phase plots similar to Figure 2 except we now plot pitch angle
against phase. The initial conditions are b = 0.005, ωc = 1/3, v⊥ = 0.65 and E=150 keV, The
phase plots are qualitatively similar to Figure 2 and share many of the same features. Regular
trajectories are conﬁned to close to the resonance pitch angle αr = arctan(v⊥0/vr) where
v⊥0 is the initial perpendicular velocity (0.65c) and vr is the resonance velocity. Stochastic
particles can diﬀuse throughout the stochastic region of phase space and electrons with the
maximum parallel velocity in Figure 2 will have the minimum pitch angle.

In Figure 6 diﬀusion in pitch angle is very fast. Pitch angle diﬀusion of up to ±10◦ occurs
on timescales of the order of tens of gyroperiods. On this timescale electrons at Jupiters
magnetic equator (L=6) experience changes in the magnetic ﬁeld of less than 1%, therefore
the approximation in the numerical solutions that the background magnetic ﬁeld lines are
uniform is valid.

DISCUSSION

We have shown that the electron-whistler interaction introduces stochasticity and can
allow electrons to diﬀuse in phase space on very fast timescales. The degree of stochasticity
depends on three parameters; the wave amplitude, b, the wave frequency, ω, and the ratio
of the perpendicular velocity over the resonance velocity squared, v⊥/v2
r , which in turn is a
function of γ.

The degree of stochasticity of the system increases with both the wave amplitude, b,
and the ratio v⊥/v2
r (and hence γ). However the resonance velocity is dependent on γ
and decreases as γ increases. There exists a critical relativistic factor γc such the resonance
condition is satisﬁed with vr = 0. Therefore when γ < γc the degree of stochasticity increases
with γ and when γ > γc the degree of stochasticity decreases with γ.

We have shown the Lyapunov exponent appears to be enhanced when the wave amplitude
ωc = ω/γΩe = m/n where m, n = 2, 3, 4, ... This is a completely new phenomena and arises
purely from the interaction of the two whistler waves. Deriving this analytically will be an
area of future research.

The two whistler interaction may form part of the pitch angle scattering process along-
side other mechanisms, in particular it will enhance the slower processes, such as bounce-
resonance, that require an initial vk to operate as it speciﬁcally scatters electrons with high
perpendicular velocities and low or zero parallel velocities. Because of the ambiguity in the
data for the Jovian magnetosphere it is probable that the mechanism is ’switched on’ during
periods of intense whistler wave activity.

We have seen that for a single wave frequency the stochastic region is bounded by the
regular trajectories of untrapped electrons. For the simple two wave process considered
here, we can deﬁne a maximum and minimum parallel velocity given by v0 ± ∆v, where
v0 is the mean parallel velocity and ∆v is the change in parallel velocity (the width of the
stochastic region). In terms of the pitch angle this corresponds to a mean pitch angle α0 and
a change in pitch angle ∆α. Hence α0 and ∆α are uniquely determined by the parameters
ω, k, v⊥, B0, Bω, Ωe and ωpe.

It would be more realistic to consider the more complex situation of a wave packet con-
sisting of many more than two whistlers, with a range of frequencies. This more complex
case is diﬃcult to parameterise so we have as as initial study considered the simple two
wave case. However it is straightforward to qualitatively predict the eﬀect of adding more
wave modes to form a wave packet, if we consider adding a second pair of waves at a lower
frequency. This would add a second pair of resonances with resonance velocities of a higher
magnitude, which would have the eﬀect of destroying the regular trajectories bounding the
stochastic region for the original waves, so that a new, larger, stochastic region encompasses
the new pair of resonances. The resulting stochastic diﬀusion in pitch angle would increase
and electrons would be scattered to lower pitch angles. A more detailed investigation of this
eﬀect is required to calculate the diﬀusion coeﬃcient for the wave packet, however we can
anticipate that the timescale for diﬀusion will still scale with the electron gyroperiod.

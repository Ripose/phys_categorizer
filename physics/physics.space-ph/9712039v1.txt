Extreme Energy Cosmic Rays (EECR) Observation Capabilities of an
“Airwatch from Space” Mission
presented by C. N. De Marzoa for the Airwatch Collaboration(∗)

The longitudinal development and other characteristics of the EECR induced atmospheric showers can be
studied from space by detecting the ﬂuorescence light induced in the atmospheric nitrogen. According to the
Airwatch concept a single fast detector can be used for measuring both intensity and time development of the streak
of ﬂuorescence light produced by the atmospheric shower induced by an EECR. In the present communication
the detection capabilities for the EECR observation from space are discussed.

1. The Airwatch from space mission

EECR with energies > 1020 eV have been de-
tected through the giant showers they produce in
the atmosphere [1]. Their existence raises ques-
tions on their origin and propagation mechanism
above the ‘Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin’ cutoﬀ [2] in
the energy spectrum at ∼ 6 × 1019 eV. Because of
their very high energy, if EECR point to deﬁnite
sources, an explanation in terms of a “bottom-
up” acceleration mechanism would be favoured.
On the other hand, if they indicate broader or
structured regions, a “top-down” model consid-
ering them as decay products of topological de-
fects should be taken into account [3]. The EECR
shower development is accompanied by UV emis-
sion, in particular by the ﬂuorescence light in-
duced in the atmospheric nitrogen which has
characteristic spectral lines in the near UV. The
possibility to detect air showers through the ﬂu-
orescence light they produce has been proven by
detectors like Fly’s Eye [4], whose operation has
given information on ﬂux, incoming direction and
composition of the primary particles.

An atmospheric mass 2-3 orders of magnitude
larger can be monitored by detecting the ﬂuores-
cence light induced by EECR in the atmosphere
from a space platform [5]. The proposed “Air-
watch” Mission appears to have the capability of
measuring the EECR spectrum above 1020 eV, by
determining the arrival direction, the energy, the
Xmax and the primary species for each shower.
This capability appears to provide a complemen-

tal approach to large ground arrays and promises
the possibility of extending EECR measurements
beyond 1021 eV [6,7].

The amount of atmospheric area and mass that
can be observed from a space platform with rea-
sonable design parameters — orbit height and
It
ﬁeld of view (FOV) — is given in Tab. 1.
should be considered that the atmospheric mass
observed by Flye’s Eye is of the order of 109 tons.
The ﬂuorescence light produced by an atmo-
spheric shower of extreme energy is mainly emit-
ted in the near UV molecular nitrogen lines 337,
357 and 391 nm. As seen from space, in these
spectral bands the shower appears as a spot
of light travelling with speed near to that of
light and with changing intensity. The ﬂuores-
cence light is accompanied by Cherenkov light,
by Rayleigh and Mie scattered Cherenkov light.
All these components may be reﬂected on clouds
or ocean surface (‘end point ﬂash’). These opti-
cal phenomena bring further information on the
shower development. The spot velocity, projected
on the horizontal plane, equals the velocity of
light times the cosine of the angle of its direc-
tion with the horizontal plane. This fact provides
one possible approach to measure the direction of
the shower axis:
i.e. by measuring the velocity
position and time of the pixels ﬁred in the focal
plane detector.

In an alternative approach 2 focal plane de-
tectors on 2 separate platforms, orbiting 600 km
apart, are used for stereoscopic view - OWL con-

cept [7].

Assuming that the shower streak of light is long
10 to 100 km in the atmosphere, the Airwatch fo-
cal plane detector segmentation must be of the
order of 1000 × 1000 pixels for monitoring one
million km2 of atmosphere with suﬃcient reso-
lution and counts per year. Assuming a 5 m2
light collector (1.3 m radius) and resonable val-
ues for its optical eﬃciency; considering that ﬂu-
orescence light yield, in the 300–400 nm spectral
interval, is ∼ 4 photon/(particle· m) and that a
1020 eV shower has 6 × 1010 particles at its maxi-
mum development, the detector sensitivity has to
work at a level of 10–100 photons/pixel on inte-
gration times of about 3 µs. These requirements
ask for a detector technology based on photon-
electron conversion on a photocathode and sub-
sequent electron multiplication.

The eﬀective counting rate for an Airwatch
Mission depends on the amount of watched at-
mosphere and on the shape of the energy spec-
trum. On the higher energy side counting rate is
limited by the EECR low ﬂux. On the lower en-
ergy side the detection eﬃciency depends on the
trigger sensitivity. The trigger electronics of an
Airwatch from Space Mission can take advantage
of the unique features of the showers: there is no
possible background looking like a luminous spot
moving at light speed through the atmosphere
over tens of kilometers. The Airwatch detector
and its trigger need to be smart in detecting show-
ers on the lower energy side. At present stage of
the project an energy threshold something below
1020 eV appears reachable, allowing the compari-
son with measurements of ground based detectors
and arrays. For an atmospheric mass ∼ 1012 tons,

an order of 100 events per year could be collected
above 1020 eV.

Operations with a 10 ÷ 20% duty cycle are pre-
dicted for an Airwatch Space Mission, taking into
account sunlight, moonlight, civilization ground
lights, high clouds and average weather patterns.
An equatorial orbit will maximize observation
time over oceans and deserted areas. Radiation
degradation of the optics is also minimized. Con-
versely, one drawback of an equatorial orbit is the
higher cloud coverage.

To pursue a complete study of all the sources
of background — meteors, aurorae, lightining —
foreseen for the experiment, a precursor measure-
ment of the light phenomena in the atmosphere
(EAGLE Mission) has been proposed [8].

2. On neutrino and GRB detection

In a “top-down” acceleration scenario, a sen-
sible ﬂux of ν’s is expected on the Earth up to
EECR energies. Airwatch from Space can detect
them because of the huge and transparent target
(∼ 1012 tons) available for interaction and de-
tection. Moreover, it has been shown that the
cross section for ν interaction will increase with
energy up to the order of 102 nb at 1020 eV [9].
Because atmospheric thickness rises of about a
factor 40 as shower direction goes from vertical
to horizontal angle, EECR showers initiated by
neutrinos can be identiﬁed by their appearance at
large zenith angles and large atmospheric depths
where no hadron or photon initiated showers can
be present.

While EECR showering in the atmosphere will
appear as UV tracks spatially well deﬁned and

short in time, a GRB will arrive as a plane wave
investing the entire atmosphere and exciting by
Compton electrons a diﬀuse ﬂuorescence emission
having a peculiar space-time function [10]. This
signal can be detected by Airwatch and possible
correlations between EECR and GRB’s can be
studied.

3. Discussion and prospects

The main design parameter for an Airwatch ex-
periment is the height of the orbit. At ﬁxed FOV,
on one hand the monitored atmospheric mass in-
creases with the orbit altitude; on the other hand
the signal strength decreases. The optimum so-
lution must be decided through an eﬀective sim-
ulation of the detector performance.

A possible approach could be based on the seg-
mentation of the mission in a certain number of
small satellites. This scenario would in general
be cheaper and have a faster schedule than the
traditional single or double observatory, present-
ing the possibility to be implemented with the
methodology used in manufacturing large num-
ber of telecommunication satellites.

This solution can be approached through an ex-
ploratory mission on a single small satellite that
will be very useful both from the engineering and
the physical point of view. A spacecraft in the
range of 400 kg and 400 W can have a collection
capability of some tens of events per year, still
providing very interesting results for the EECR
study. Finally, the possibility to locate an Air-
watch from Space Mission on the Space Station
would oﬀer several technical advantages, not least
the opportunity to use a 9 m diameter collecting
mirror whose technology is available [11].

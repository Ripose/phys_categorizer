Abstract

This paper demonstrates that intermittent magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in
the plasma sheet exhibit transitory, localized, and multi-scale features. We
propose a multifractal based algorithm, which quantiﬁes intermittence on the
basis of the statistical distribution of the ’strength of burstiness’, estimated
within a sliding window. Interesting multi-scale phenomena observed by the
Cluster spacecraft include large scale motion of the current sheet and bursty
bulk ﬂow associated turbulence, interpreted as a cross-scale coupling (CSC)
process.

Introduction

The study of turbulence in near-Earth cosmic plasma is important in many re-
spects. Turbulence, being in its nature a multi-scale phenomenon, may inﬂuence
the transfer processes of energy, mass and momentum on both MHD and kinetic
scales. Vice versa, turbulence can be driven by instabilities such as magnetic
reconnection or current disruption [Tetreault(1992), Angelopoulos et al.(1999a),
Klimas et al.(2000), Chang et al.(2002), Lui(2002)]

The understanding of intermittence features of ﬂuctuations is fundamental to
turbulence. Intermittence simply refers to processes which display ’sporadic activ-

1

ity’ during only a small fraction of the considered time or space. This is also the
case in non-homogeneous turbulence where the distribution of energy dissipation
regions is sporadic and probability distributions of measurable quantities are long-
tailed with signiﬁcant departures from gaussianity. Rare events forming the tails
of probability distribution functions, however, carry a decisive amount of energy
present in a process [Frisch(1995)].

Substantial experimental evidence exists for the occurence of intermittent pro-
cesses within the plasma sheet. [Baumjohann et al.(1990)] showed that within the
inner plasma sheet inside of 20 RE high-speed short-lived (∼ 10 sec) plasma
ﬂows are rather bursty. [Angelopoulos et al.(1992)] noted that those ﬂows orga-
nize themselves into ∼ 10 min time scale groups called bursty bulk ﬂows (BBF).
Despite the fact that BBFs represent relatively rare events (10-20 % of all mea-
surements), they are the carriers of the decisive amount of mass, momentum and
magnetic ﬂux [Angelopoulos et al.(1999b), Sch¨odel et al.(2001)] and can therefore
energetically inﬂuence the near-Earth auroral regions [Nakamura et al.(2001)].

So far experimental evidence for real plasma sheet turbulence is not unam-
biguous, however its existence is supported by the occurrence of plasma ﬂuctua-
tions in bulk ﬂow velocity and magnetic ﬁeld which are comparable or even larger
than the corresponding mean values [Borovsky et al.(1997)]. Other characteris-
tics of plasma sheet turbulence, such as probability distributions, mixing length,
eddy viscosity, power spectra, magnetic Reynolds number, etc., were found to ex-
hibit the expected features or to be in expected ranges predicted by turbulence
theories [Borovsky et al.(1997)]. Though the amplitude of the velocity and mag-
netic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations increases with geomagnetic activity [Neagu et al.(2002)],
intense ﬂuctuations are present independently from the level of geomagnetic ac-
tivity [Borovsky et al.(1997)], indicating that different sources or driving mecha-
nisms might be involved in their generation. In fact, according to observations by
[Angelopoulos et al.(1999a)], at least a bi-modal state of the inner plasma sheet
convection is recognizable from plasma ﬂow magnitude probability density func-
tions: BBF–associated intermittent jet turbulence and intermittent turbulence which
occurs during non-BBF (quiet background) ﬂows.
[Angelopoulos et al.(1999a)]
have also proposed that BBF–generated intermittent turbulence can alter transport
processes in plasma sheet and may represent a way that cross-scale coupling (CSC)
takes place.

These facts call for a method which allows analysis of both intermittence and
multi-scale properties of ﬂuctuations. In this paper we propose a multifractal tech-
nique for this purpose. Using both magnetic ﬁeld and ion velocity data from Clus-
ter, we will show that BBF–associated ’magnetic turbulence’ exhibits clear signa-
tures of cross-scale energisation.

2 Multifractal approach to turbulence

In order to elucidate the basic assumptions of our approach we use a multino-
mial distribution model ﬁrst and introduce a local parameter for quantiﬁcation of
the intermittence level on a given scale. Then we discuss the range of potential
scales over which the presence of cross-scale energisation might be experimentally
demonstrable and mention some limitations regarding the availability of multipoint
observations.

2.1 Local intermittence measure (LIM)

The large scale representation of magnetotail processes by mean values of mea-
surable quantities is useful but can also be misleading in characterising multi-scale
phenomena when quantities observed on different scales carry physically important
information.

Multifractals are well suited for describing local scaling properties of dissi-
pation ﬁelds in non-homogeneous turbulence [Frisch(1995)]. Therefore they are
most suitable for a description of plasma sheet ﬂuctuations. In non-homogeneous
turbulence, the transfer of energy from large scales to smaller scales can be con-
veniently modeled by a multiplicative cascade process. The distribution of energy
dissipation ﬁelds on small scales exhibits burstiness and intermittence.

Let us consider a simple model example. Multinomial deterministic measures
are examples of multifractals [Riedi(1999)]. These consist of a simple recursive
construction rule: a uniform measure µ(L) is chosen on an interval I : [0, L] and
is then unevenly distributed over n > 1 (n - integer) equal subintervals of I using
weights mi; i = 1, ..., n and Pi mi = 1. Usually L is chosen to be 1. After the
ﬁrst iteration we have n equal subintervals, and subinterval i contains a fraction
µ(L)mi of µ(L). Next every subinterval and the measure on it are splitted in the
same way recursively, having i = 1, ..., nk subintervals or boxes after k iteration
steps and µk,i in the box Ik,i. Figure 1 shows the simplest example of a binomial
distribution (n = 2). We note that the measure µ can be any positive and additive
quantity, such as energy, mass, etc.

Figure 2a presents two distributions, A and B, separated by a dashed ver-
tical line in the middle. Both mimic typical bursty ’time series’ like a physi-
cal variable from a turbulent system, however, by construction distribution A is
less intermittent than distribution B .
In both cases the same initial mass (µ)
is distributed over interval L, n = 8; k = 5 is chosen (that is nk = 32768
boxes), but the weights mi(A) = (0.125, 0.08, 0.09, 0.16, 0.05, 0.25, 0.12, 0.125)
and mi(B) = (0.1, 0.3, 0.05, 0.002, 0.04, 0.218, 0.09, 0.2) are different. Intermit-
tence is larger in case B (Figure 2a) because of the larger differences between

3

weights (if all weights were equal, the resulting distribution would become homo-
geneous). Our goal is to quantify this level of intermittence by multifractals. The
deﬁnition of multifractality in terms of the large deviation principle simply states
that a dissipation ﬁeld, characterized locally by a given ’strength of burstiness’ α,
has a distribution f (α) over the considered ﬁeld. It measures a deviaton of the ob-
served α from the expected value α. The corresponding (α, f (α)) large deviation
spectrum is of concave shape [Riedi(1999)].

The strength of local burstiness, the so called coarse-grain H¨older exponent α,

is computed as

αi ∼ logµk,i
log[I]k,i

(1)

where [I]k,i is the size of the k, i-th box and equality holds asymptotically.

It is expected that due to its multiplicative construction rule µk,i will decay fast
as [I]k,i → 0 and k → ∞. We add that αi < 1 indicates bursts on all scales while
αi > 1 characterizes regions where events occur sparsely [Riedi(1999)]. Equation
(1) then expresses the power-law dependence of the measure on resolution. Usu-
ally ’histogram methods’ are used for the estimation of the f (α) specturm (called
also rate function), so that the number of intervals Ik,i for which αk,i falls in a
box between αmin and αmax (the estimated minimum and maximum values of
α) is computed and f (α) is found by regression.
In this paper, however, f (α)
spectra are estimated using the FRACLAB package which was developed at the
Institute National de Recherche en Informatique, Le Chesnay, France. Here the
well known statistical kernel method for density estimations is used which also
yields satisfactory estimations for processes different from purely multiplicative
ones [V´ehel and Vojak(1998), Canus et al.(1998)].

A comparison of Figures 2a and 3 indicates that the wider the f (α) spec-
trum the more intermittent the measure. This feature was also proposed to study
the possible role of turbulence in solar wind - magnetosphere coupling processes
[V¨or¨os et al.(2002)] and this feature will be used to describe magnetic ﬁeld inter-
mittence in the plasma sheet.

In order to gain appropriate information about the time evolution of intermit-
tence from real data we estimate f (α) within sliding overlapping windows W with
a shift S ≪ W .
In our model case the time axis is represented by increasing
number of subintervals Ik,i. LIM is introduced as the total area under each f (α)
curve within a window W , divided by the mean area obtained from the measure-
ments along the reference measure A. Actually LIM (A) ﬂuctuates around 1 due
to errors introduced by ﬁnite window length. For measures, exhibiting higher level
of intermittence than the reference measure A, LIM > 1. Figure 2b shows that
for measures A and B the different levels of intermittence are properly recognized

4

by LIM . Estimations based on a larger window (Window I: W = 7000 boxes,
S = 100 boxes) are more robust, but a smaller window (Window II:W = 2000
boxes, S = 100 boxes) allows a better localization of the transition point between
measures A and B (thick line in the middle of Figure 2a).

2.2 Multi-scale LIM

Deterministic multinomial measures are self-similar in the sense that the construc-
tion rule is the same at every scale. Real data are more complex. Physical pro-
cesses may have characteristic scales or may distribute energy differently over
some ranges of scales. In order to study BBF–associated magnetic turbulence on
both large and small scales we introduce a ’time scale’ τ through differentiation

δBx(t, τ ) = Bx(t + τ ) − Bx(t)

Throughout the paper the GSM coordinate system is used in which the x-axis is
deﬁned along the line connecting the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth.
The origin is deﬁned at the center of the Earth and is positive towards the Sun.
Then a normalized measure at a time ti is given by

(2)

(3)

µBx(ti, τ ) =

x(ti, τ )

δB2
Pi δB2

x(ti, τ )

We have to mention, however, some essential limitations of this approach when a
separation of spatial and temporal variations is eventually addressed. A time series
obtained from a single spacecraft can be used for mapping the spatial structure
of turbulence using the so called Taylor’s hypothesis if the spatial ﬂuctuations on
a scale l pass over the spacecraft faster than they typically ﬂuctuate in time. In
the plasma sheet this can probably be the case during fast BBFs [Horbury(2000)].
Otherwise Taylor’s hypothesis may not be completely valid. Instead of Equation
(2) a real two-point expression, δBx+l(t) = Bx+l(t) − Bx(t) could be used, where
l is a distance between Cluster spacecraft. The corresponding LIM , however,
strongly ﬂuctuates in a variety of cases (not shown), presumably due to mapping
of physically different and structured regions by individual Cluster satellites. We
postpone this kind of multi-point observations to future work.

Nevertheless, [Angelopoulos et al.(1999a)] noticed that some characteristics of
turbulence estimated from single point measurements are equivalent to ones from
two-point measurements for distances at or beyond the upper limit of the inertial
range in which case Equation (2) can be used efﬁciently. [Borovsky et al.(1997)]
estimated the lower limit of inertial range to be about ion gyroperiod time scales
(∼ 10 sec in plasma sheet), over which a strong dissipation of MHD structures is

5

expected. The upper limit of inertial range (largest scale) was identiﬁed by plasma
sheet convection time scale or by inter-substorm time scale, both of order 5 h. As
known, inertial range refers to a range of wavenumbers (or corresponding scales)
over which turbulence dynamics is characterized by zero forcing and dissipation
[Frisch(1995)]. Recent theoretical and experimental work shows, however, that
inertial range cascades might be exceptional. In a large variety of turbulent ﬂows
rather bidirectional direct coupling (or cross scale coupling - CSC) due to non-
linearity and nonlocality between large and small scales exists [Tsinober(2001)].
While the large scales are determined by velocity ﬂuctuations, the small scales are
represented by the ﬁeld of velocity derivatives (vorticity, strain).

3 Data analysis

3.1 General considerations

In this paper we analyse intermittence properties of 22 Hz resolution magnetic ﬁeld
data from the Cluster (CL) ﬂuxgate magnetometer (FGM) [Balogh et al.(2001)]
and compare those characteristics with the spin-resolution (∼ 4 sec) velocity data
from the Cluster ion spectrometry (CIS/CODIF) experiment [R`eme et al.(2001)].
Compared with the previous model example, the estimation of the LIM for
the BX component of the magnetic data was somewhat different. First of all, we
calculated LIM (t, τ ) for different time scales τ .
In optimal case energization
through a cascading process should appear on different scales time shifted, that
is the large scales should become energized ﬁrst and the small scales later. We
found, however, that on various scales LIM ﬂuctuates strongly (not shown) and
using this approach it would be hard to identify an energy cascading process within
an inertial range of scales. This was not unexpected, because cascade models are
treated in Fourier space (wave vector space) whereas our approach represents a
pure time-domain analysis method (though the magnetic ﬁeld data itself already
contain some spatial information), so the individual scales have rather different
meanings. Also, nonlinear and nonlocal direct interactions between scales may
prevent experimental recognition of cascades.

Therefore, we decided to estimate LIM on several scales around 40 sec, which
is considered to be a typical large scale of BBF velocity ﬂuctuations, and compute
the average LIML (subscript L reads as large scale) from the corresponding f (α)
spectra. BBF events usually last several minutes [Angelopoulos et al.(1992)], how-
ever, if τ is chosen to be several minutes long, the corresponding window length
W should be even several times longer which would make measurements of the
non-stationary features of intermittence almost impossible.

A typical small scale was chosen experimentally. We looked for a τ (Equation

6

2) which reﬂects the small scale changes of the intermittence level properly. We
found that ﬂuctuations on time scales larger than a few seconds already exhibit
similar intermittence properties as on scales around 40 sec. In fact, the majority
of bursty ﬂows may remain uninteruptedly at high speed levels for a few seconds
[Baumjohann et al.(1990)]. Therefore we considered time scales around 0.4 sec
as small ones (two orders less than the chosen large scale) and the corresponding
intermittence measure reads as LIMS. This timescale may already comprise some
kinetic effects. The use of 22 Hz resolution magnetic data from FGM experiment
on such small time scales implies the problem of different transfer functions for
high and low frequencies. Corrections introduced by appropriate ﬁltering had no
effect on the LIM estimations.

3.2 Event overview and LIM analysis

The events, we are interested in, occured between 1055 and 1135 UT on August
29, 2001 (Figure 4a), when CL was located at a radial distance of about 19.2 RE,
near midnight.
In the following the relatively ’quiet’ time period from 1115 to
1120 UT will be used as a reference level for both LIML and LIMS estimations.
It means, that during this time period the LIML,S mean values equal 1.

The current sheet structure and movement during 1055 - 1107 UT has been
studied by [Runov et al.(2002)]. Only the BX component from CL 3 will be eval-
uated. During the chosen interval CL 3 was located approximately 1500 km south
of the other three spacecraft. CL traversed the neutral sheet from the northern
(BX ∼ 20 nT) to the southern hemisphere (BX ∼ −15 nT), then BX approached
BX ∼ 0 again (Figure 4a). The correspondingly normalized small scale (τ =0.4
sec) and large scale (τ =40 sec) measures (Equations 2 and 3) are depicted by red
and blue curves in Figures 4 b an c, respectively. In fact, Equaton 2 represents a
high-pass or low-pass ﬁlter for properly chosen time shifts τ . Therefore Figure 4b
(4c) shows an enhanced level of small-scale (large-scale) ﬂuctuations when high-
frequency (low-frequency) ﬂuctuations are present in Figure 4a. LIML,S were
computed as a changing area under f (α) multifractal distribution curves over the
interval α ∈ (1, αmax) and within sliding window W=318 sec. The time shift
is S=4.5 sec. These parameters were chosen such that the opposing requirements
for stability of LIM estimations (wide window needed) and for time-localization
of non-stationary events (narrow window needed) were matched. Considering the
whole area under the f (α) curves, i.e. estimating LIM over α ∈ (αmin, αmax)
as in the previous section (model case) would be also possible. This gives, how-
ever, the same qualitative results. During intervals of changing intermittence level
mainly the right wing of f (α) changes. Therefore we estimated LIM over the
interval α ∈ (1, αmax). Figure 4d shows, 10 red curves of LIMS(t, τ ) computed

7

for τ ∈ (0.3, 0.5) sec, and 10 blue curves for τ ∈ (30, 50) sec. Obviously, LIML
and LIMS exhibit quite different courses and we will analyse the differences in
more detail.

First, we examine the f (α) multifractal spectra. Windows A, B, C and D in
Figure 4a indicate periods during which distinct physical phenomena occured. The
differences are evident from the magnetic ﬁeld BX, measures µBx and LIML,S
evolution over time (Figure 4 a–d). We focus mainly on an interval between 1123
UT and 1133 UT in which both LIML and LIMS have increased values. Pe-
riod C is during this interval. We contrast this interval with 1055 to 1110 UT, at
the beginning of which a wavy ﬂapping motion or an expansion-contraction of the
current sheet is observed (Period A) with a characteristic time scale of 70-90 sec
[Runov et al.(2002)]. Periods B and C represent quiet intervals with different BX
values. The corresponding f (α) spectra are depicted by red and blue circles in
Figure 5. We also computed the global f (α) spectra for the whole BX time se-
ries on small and large scales from 1055 to 1135 UT, which are depicted by solid
red and blue lines, respectively. Deviations from these average f (α) curves clas-
sify physical processes occurring during periods A–D. An examination of only the
right wings of the distributions leads to the following conlusions (see also Figure
4a and d): (1.) the f (α) spectra estimated on both large and small scales exceed the
average f (α) only during period C; (2.) during period A (large scale ﬂapping mo-
tion) only the large scale (blue circles) exceed the average blue curve signiﬁcantly;
(3.) quiet periods B and D exhibit average or narrower than average distributions.
With the deﬁnition of LIM , we have introduced a number which quantiﬁes
intermittence as an area under the right wing of the f (α) distribution function.
We have to emphasize, however, that f (α) distributions cannot be described or re-
placed by one number. The whole distribution contains more information. It is ev-
ident from Figure 5 that the more intermittent period C is also characterized by the
largest difference between αmax and αmin on small scale (red circles). Also only in
this case the maximum of the f (α) curve is signiﬁcantly shifted to the right. There
are multiplicative cascade models for which multifractal distributions of concave
shape and the underlying intermittence properties can be described by one param-
eter, e.g.
the P-model [Halsey et al.(1986), V¨or¨os et al.(2002)]. However, those
models cannot ﬁt the data well because of the non-stationarity and shortness of the
available time series in the plasma sheet. This is clearly visible in the case of large
scale non-concave distributions during periods A and C (blue circles, Figure 5).
For this reason LIM represents a descriptor which tells more about the intermit-
tent ﬂuctuations than second order statistics, but less than the whole multifractal
distribution function.

3.3 Multi-spacecraft comparison and BBF occurrence

To facilitate interpretation, the BX components from two Cluster spacecraft (CL1
and CL3) are depicted in Figure 6a. The difference between the BX components
measured at the locations of CL1 and 3 changes substantially during the consid-
ered interval, indicating spatial gradients of the order of the distance between CLs
within current sheet. The largest spatial gradients occur during and after the ﬂap-
ping motion from 1055 to 1110 UT. Large gradients are also present during interval
1122 – 1130 UT. These two intervals are separated by a ∼ 10 min interval, from
1110 to 1121 UT, characterized by small spatial gradients and −18 < BX < −10
nT. Therefore, the spacecraft are outside of the current sheet. There are two more
periods when the observed spatial gradients are small. The ﬁrst is before 1055 UT
(BX > 18 nT), when the spacecraft were in the northern lobe. The interval af-
ter 1130 UT contains also small spatial gradients, but the BX components change
from -6 to 2 nT, indicating that the spacecraft are closer to the center of current
sheet.

Figure 6b shows LIML,S (red and blue curves). Standard deviations computed
from a number of f (α) distributions (Figure 4d) estimated around τ = 40 and
0.4 sec are also depicted by thin lines round LIML,S(t) in Figure 6b. Window
parameters are also indicated.

It is visible that during the large scale motion (thoroughly analysed by

[Runov et al.(2002)]) and after, until ∼ 1110 UT (Figure 6a), LIM shows en-
hanced intermittence level on large scales, but not on small scales (Figure 6b).
LIML is also high before 1055 UT, only because the local window W extends
over the period of wavy motion of current sheet. As no enhanced intermittence
level is observed during the whole interval until ∼ 1110 UT on small scales, we
conclude that cross-scale energisation is not present. More precisely, at least in
terms of intermittent ﬂuctuations quantiﬁed by LIM , there was no CSC mecha-
nism present that could couple large scale energy reservoirs at the level of the MHD
ﬂow (∼ 40 sec) to the small scales (∼ 0.4 sec). We cannot exclude, however, other
mechanisms of CSC not directly associated with LIM changes.

LIML tends to decrease rapidly after 1110 UT because data from outside the

current sheet inﬂuence its estimation.

Between 1120 and 1135 UT both LIML and LIMS increase. This enhance-
ment is clearly associated with high frequency intermittent ﬂuctuations in BX (Fig-
ure 6a; see also the global spectrum for period C in Figure 5) and with occurence of
a BBF. In Figure 6c we show the proton velocity data from CIS/CODIF experiment
(H +VX; GSM). Figure 7a shows magnetic ﬁeld BZ component of the magnetic
ﬁeld measured by CL3 while Figure 7b – d show BX , proton velocity and LIM at
better time resolution than in Figure 6.

9

Four windows centered on points marked by crosses indicate the times when
LIML,S signiﬁcantly increase or decrease relative to the quiet level (LIML,S ∼1).
Vertical red and blue arrows indicate the starting points of increase and decrease of
LIML,S, respectively.

When the spacecraft enter the current sheet after 1120 UT, LIML increases and
window 1 shows that the enhancement is associated with the appearance of large
scale ﬂuctuations in BX, a small decrease of BZ and gradual increase of VX,H +
starting at 1122:20 UT (see the vertical dashed line at the right end of window 1).
Approximately two minutes later, the center of window 2 points at ﬁrst signiﬁcant
enhancement of LIMS (red vertical arrow). LIMS achieved its maximum value
1.14 ± 0.02 within ∼ 40 sec. The right end of window 2 is clearly associated with:
(1.) magnetic ﬁeld dipolarization (rapid increase of BZ to ∼ 8-10 nT in Figure 7a.);
(2.) appearance of high frequency ﬂuctuations in BX(CL3), (in Figure 7b.); (3.)
BBF velocities larger than 400 km/s (Figure 7c.); (4.) enhancements of energetic
ion and electron ﬂuxes on CL3 (not shown); all at ∼ 1124:27 UT.

LIMS drops to 1.05 ± 0.02 at 1127:45 UT (marked by red arrow from the cen-
ter of window 3). This time, the right end of window 3 starts to leave behind the
largest peaks of VX,H +, but that is not the only reason of the decrease of LIMS.
When LIMS decreases, LIML remains at high level (1.24 ± 0.05), or even in-
creases, because of the sudden jump in BX form -10 to +2 nT closely before 1130
UT. It was previously mentioned that after 1130 UT the spacecraft got closer to the
center of current sheet. Therefore, we suppose that due to the large scale motion
of the current sheet, which keeps LIML at a high level, the spacecraft appear to
be outside of the region of BBF–associated turbulence. This is also supported by
the simultaneous decrease of both LIML and LIMS at approximately 1132:30
UT, when window 4 includes BX from the region with small gradients after 1130
UT. Therefore, during the interval between the right ends of window 2 and 3, i.e.
within a time period of ∼ 6 minutes from 1124 to 1130 UT, LIM analysis indi-
cates BBF and dipolarization associated CSC between MHD and small, possibly
kinetic scales. An alternative to the CSC might be a simultaneous, but indepen-
dent enhancement of intermittent ﬂuctuations on both large and small scales. As
was mentioned earlier, an identiﬁcation of the energy-cascading process is almost
impossible using the applied method. The primary pile-up of energy associated
with increase of BBF velocity on large scales at 1122:20 UT, however, seems to
indicate that in this case small scale ﬂuctuations are energised by MHD scale rapid
ﬂows. Unambiguous evidence for or against BBF–related CSC requires a statistical
ensemble of events to be analysed. We mention, inverse cascades during current
disruption events were reported by [Lui(1998)].

The large difference between LIML and LIMS after 1128 UT can be at-
tributed to the prevailing large scale motion of the current sheet. The spacecraft

10

got closer to the centre of current sheet where the multiscale LIM signs of CSC
are already absent. This can be explained by the transitory and localized nature of
CSC.

4 Conclusions

We proposed a windowed multifractal method to quantify local intermittence of
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations obtained by Cluster. The main results of this paper
comprise a multi-scale description of large scale current sheet motion and of a
BBF–associated cross-scale energisation process. We have shown as Cluster passes
through different plasma regions, physical processes exhibit non-stationary inter-
mittence properties on MHD and small, possibly kinetic scales. As any robust esti-
mation of turbulence characteristics requires processing of long time series (due
to the presence of energetic but rare events), the observed transitory and non-
stationary nature of ﬂuctuations prevents us to unambiguously support or reject
a model for plasma sheet turbulence.

The multifractal description of intermittent magnetic ﬂuctuations is in accor-
dance with previous knowledge that the change of fractal scaling properties can
be associated with phase transition like phenomenon and self organization in the
plasma sheet [Chang(1999), Consolini and Chang(2001), Consolini and Lui(2001),
Milovanov et al.(2001)]. Our results also support the idea of
[Angelopoulos et al.(1999a)] that BBF–related intermittent turbulence may repre-
sent an effective way for CSC. Propagating BBFs can modify a critical thresh-
old for nonlinear instabilities or trigger further localized reconnections because
of the free energy present on multiple scales.
In this sense, our results suggest
that BBFs may represent those multiscale carriers of energy, ﬂux and momentum,
which lead to the avalanche-like spread of disturbances on medium or large-scales
[Klimas et al.(2000), Lui(2002)]. In this respect classiﬁcation of multi-scale phys-
ical processes using LIM , or multifractal distributions offers a way in which the
role of turbulence in a variety of dynamical processes within plasma sheet can be
statistically evaluated.

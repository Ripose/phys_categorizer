Abstract

We investigate the steepening of the magnetic ﬂuctuation power
law spectra observed in the inner solar wind for frequencies higher
than 0.5 Hz. This high frequency part of the spectrum may be at-
tributed to dispersive nonlinear processes. In that context, the long-
time behavior of weakly interacting waves is examined in the frame-
work of three–dimensional incompressible Hall magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence. The Hall term added to the standard MHD equa-
tions makes the Alfv´en waves dispersive and circularly polarized. We
introduce the generalized Els¨asser variables and, using a complex he-
licity decomposition, we derive for three-wave interaction processes
the general wave kinetic equations; they describe the nonlinear dy-
namics of Alfv´en, whistler and ion cyclotron wave turbulence in the
presence of a strong uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0ˆe

bulence is characterized by anisotropies of diﬀerent strength: (i) for

1 Introduction

Spacecraft observations of the inner solar wind, i.e. for heliocentric distances
less than 1AU, show magnetic and velocity ﬂuctuations over a broad range
of frequencies, from 10−5Hz up to several hundred Hz (see e.g. Coleman,
1968; Belcher and Davis, 1971; Matthaeus and Goldstein, 1982; Roberts et
al., 1987; Grappin et al., 1990; Burlaga, 1991; Leamon et al., 1998). These
ﬂuctuations possess many properties expected of fully developed weakly com-
pressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence (Goldstein and Roberts,
1999). For that reason the interplanetary medium is often seen as a vast lab-
oratory for studying many fundamental questions about turbulent plasmas.
Compressed interaction regions produced by velocity diﬀerences are clearly
observed in the outer solar wind. In regions where fast streams overtake slow
streams, the spectrum of the large scale magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations follows
a f −2 frequency power law (Burlaga et al., 1987) which was shown to be a
spectral signature of jumps (Roberts et al., 1987). Compressive eﬀects are
however weaker in the inner solar wind. For example, the normalized den-
sity ﬂuctuations near the current sheet at 0.3AU are often smaller than 5%
(Bavassano et al., 1997). This tendency is conﬁrmed by indirect measure-
ments through radio wave interplanetary scintillation observations at helio-
centric distances of 16
26 solar radius (Spangler, 2002). Waves and turbu-
lence – the subject of this paper – are better observed in the pure/polar wind
where generally the density ﬂuctuations are weaker than in the current sheet.
Therefore, the inner solar wind may be seen mainly as a weakly compressible
medium.

The turbulent state of the solar wind was suggested by [24] who reported
a power law behavior for energy spectra with spectral indices lying between
2. The original signals being measured in time, these observa-
−
tional spectra are measured in frequency. Since the solar wind is super-
sonic and super-Alfv´enic, the Taylor “frozen-in ﬂow” hypothesis is usually
used to connect directly a frequency to a wavenumber which allows even-

tually a comparison with theoretical predictions. Note, however, that for
anisotropic turbulence a relevant comparison with theoretical predictions,
like those made in this paper, are only possible if a three dimensional en-
ergy spectrum is accessible by in situ measurements, a situation that is not
currently achieved (see, however, Matthaeus et al., 2005; see also the last
Section). More precise measurements (see e.g. Matthaeus and Goldstein,
1.7
1982) revealed that the spectral index at low frequency is often about
which is closer to the Kolmogorov prediction (Kolmogorov, 1941) for neutral
5/3) rather than the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan prediction (Iroshnikov,
ﬂuids (
3/2). Both predictions are
1963; Kraichnan, 1965) for magnetized ﬂuids (
built, in particular, on the hypothesis of isotropic turbulence. However, the
presence of Alfv´en waves in the fast solar wind attests that the magnetic
ﬁeld has a preferential direction which is likely at the origin of anisotropic
turbulence provided that the amount of counter-propagating Alfv´en waves
is enough. Indeed, in situ measurements of cross helicity show clearly that
outward propagative Alfv´en waves are the main component of the fast solar
wind at short radial distances (Belcher and Davis, 1971) but they become
less dominant beyond 1AU. Since pure Alfv´en waves are exact solutions of
the ideal incompressible MHD equations (see e.g. Pouquet, 1993), nonlinear
interactions should be suppressed if only one type of waves is present. The
variance analysis of the magnetic ﬁeld components and magnitude shows
clearly that the magnetic ﬁeld vector of the fast solar wind has a varying di-
rection but with only a weak variation in magnitude (see e.g. Forsyth et al.,
1996ab). Typical values give a ratio of the normalized variance of the ﬁeld
magnitude smaller than 10% whereas for the components it can be as large
as 50%. In these respects, the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld may be seen as
a vector liying approximately around the Parker spiral direction with only
weak magnitude variations (Barnes, 1981). Solar wind anisotropy with more
power perpendicular to the mean magnetic ﬁeld than that parallel is pointed
out by data analyses (Belcher and Davis, 1971; Klein et al., 1993) with a
ratio of power up to 30. From single-point spacecraft measurements it is
however not possible to specify the exact three-dimensional form of the spec-
tral tensor of the magnetic or velocity ﬂuctuations. In absence of such data,
[15] with a quasi two-dimensional model, in which wave vectors are nearly
perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld, argued that about 85% of so-
lar wind turbulence possesses a dominant 2D component. Additionally, solar
wind anisotropies is detected through radio wave scintillations which reveal
that density spectra close to the Sun are highly anisotropic with irregularities

3

stretched out mainly along the radial direction (Armstrong et al., 1990).

−

Most of the papers dealing with interplanetary turbulence tend to focus
on a frequency inertial range where the MHD approximation is well satis-
ﬁed. It is the domain where the power spectral index is often found to be
around the Kolmogorov index. During the last decades several properties
of the solar wind turbulence have been understood in this framework. Less
understood is what happens outside of this range of frequencies. At lower
frequencies (< 10−5Hz) ﬂatter power laws are found in particular for the fast
solar wind with indices close to
1 and even less (in absolute value) for the
smallest frequencies. These large scales are often interpreted as the energy
containing scales. But the precise role of the low solar corona in the gen-
eration of such scales and the origin of the evolution of the spectral index
when the distance from the Sun increases are still not well understood (see
e.g. Velli et al., 1989; Horbury, 1999). For frequencies higher than 0.5Hz a
steepening of the magnetic ﬂuctuation power law spectra is observed over
more than two decades (Coroniti et al., 1982; Denskat et al., 1983, Leamon
et al., 1998) with a spectral index on average around
3. Note that the
latest analysis made with the Cluster spacecraft data reveals a less steep
2.12 (Bale et al., 2005). This new range, exhibiting
spectral index about
a power law, is characterized by a bias of the polarization suggesting that
these ﬂuctuations are likely to be right-hand polarized, outward propagating
waves (Goldstein et al., 1994). Various indirect lines of evidence indicate
that these waves propagate at large angles to the background magnetic ﬁeld
and that the power in ﬂuctuations parallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld
is much less than the perpendicular one (Coroniti et al., 1982; Leamon et
al., 1998). For these reasons, it is thought (e.g. Stawicki et al., 2001) that
Alfv´en – left circularly polarized – ﬂuctuations are suppressed by proton cy-
clotron damping and that the high frequency power law spectra are likely
to consist of whistler waves. This scenario proposed is supported by direct
numerical simulations of compressible 2 1
2D Hall MHD turbulence (Ghosh et
al., 1996) where a steepening of the spectra is found and associated with the
appearance of right circularly polarized ﬂuctuations. It is plausible that what
has been conventionally thought of as a dissipation range is actually a disper-
sive or inertial range and that the steeper power law may be due to nonlinear
wave processes rather than dissipation (see e.g. Krishan and Mahajan, 2004).
Under this new interpretation, the resistive dissipation range of frequencies
may be moved to frequencies higher than the electron cyclotron frequency. A
recent study (Stawicki et al., 2001) suggests that the treatment of the solar

−

−

4

wind dispersive range should include magnetosonic/whistler waves since it
is often observed that the high frequency ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld
are much smaller than the background magnetic ﬁeld (see also Forsyth et
al., 1996ab). It seems therefore that a nonlinear theory built on weak wave
turbulence may be a useful point of departure for understanding the detailed
physics of solar wind turbulence.

It is well known that the presence of a mean magnetic ﬁeld plays a fun-
damental role in the behavior of compressible or incompressible MHD tur-
bulence (Montgomery and Turner, 1981; Shebalin et al. 1983; Oughton et
al., 1994; Matthaeus et al., 1996; Kinney and McWilliams, 1998; Cho and
Vishniac, 2000; Oughton and Matthaeus, 2005). The main eﬀect is that the
mean magnetic ﬁeld renders the turbulence quasi-bidimensional with a non-
linear transfer essentially perpendicular to its direction. Note that in such
a situation, it is known that compressible MHD behaves very similarly to
reduced MHD (see e.g. Dmitruk et al, 2005). This property is generalized
to 2 1
2D compressible Hall MHD for high and low beta β plasma simulations
(Ghosh and Goldstein, 1997) for which strong anisotropies are also found
It was suggested that the
when a strong mean magnetic ﬁeld is present.
action of the Hall term is to provide additional suppression of energy cas-
cades along the mean ﬁeld direction and incompressibility may not be able to
reproduce the dynamics seen in the simulations. This conclusion is slightly
diﬀerent to what we ﬁnd in the present study where we show that incom-
pressibility in Hall MHD allows to reproduce several properties observed like
anisotropic turbulence.
Incompressible Hall MHD is often used to under-
stand, for example, the main impact of the Hall term on ﬂowing plasmas
(Ohsaki, 2005), or in turbulent dynamo (Mininni et al, 2003). In the present
paper, we derive a weak wave turbulence formalism for incompressible Hall
MHD in the presence of a strong external mean magnetic ﬁeld, where Alfv´en,
ion cyclotron and whistler/electron waves are taken into account. One of the
main results is the derivation of the wave kinetic equations at the lowest
order, i.e. for three-wave interaction processes. For such a turbulence, it is
possible to show, in particular, a global tendency towards anisotropy with
nonlinear transfers preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld. Hall MHD wave turbulence theory describes a wide range
of frequencies, from the low frequency limit of pure Alfv´enic turbulence to
the high frequency limit of whistler wave turbulence for which the asymp-
totic theories have been derived recently (Galtier et al., 2000-2002; Galtier
and Bhattacharjee, 2003). By recovering both theories as two particular lim-

5

its, we recover all the well-known properties associated. Ion cyclotron wave
turbulence appears as a third particular limit for which we report a detailed
analysis. The energy spectrum of Hall MHD is characterized by two inertial
ranges, which are exact solutions of the wave kinetic equations, separated by
a knee. The position of the knee corresponds to the scale where the Hall term
becomes sub/dominant. We develop a single anisotropic phenomenology that
recovers the power law solutions found and makes the link continuously in
wavenumbers between the two scaling laws. A nonlocal analysis performed
on the wave kinetic equations reveals that a non trivial dynamics between
Alfv´en, whistler and ion cyclotron waves happens only when a discrepancy
from the equipartition between the large scale kinetic and magnetic energies
exists. We believe that the description given here may help to better under-
stand the inner solar wind observations and, in particular, the existence of
dispersive/non-dispersive inertial ranges.

The organization of the paper is as follows:

in Section 2, we discuss
about the approximation of incompressible Hall MHD and the existence of
transverse, circularly polarized waves; we introduce the generalized Els¨asser
variables and the complex helical decomposition. In Section 3, we develop the
wave turbulence formalism and we derive the wave kinetic equations for three-
wave interaction processes. Section 4 is devoted to the general properties of
Hall MHD wave turbulence. Section 5 deals with the small and large scale
limits respectively of the master equations of wave turbulence. In particular,
we give a detail study of the ion cyclotron wave turbulence. In Section 6,
we derive an anisotropic heuristic description which, in particular, makes
the link between the previous predictions. In Section 7, we analyze nonlocal
interactions between Alfv´en, whistler and ion cyclotron waves. Section 8
is devoted to the possible sources of anisotropy.
In Section 9, we discuss
about the domain of validity of the theory and the diﬀerence between wave
and strong turbulence. Finally, we conclude with a summary and a general
discussion in the last Section.

2 Hall magnetohydrodynamics approximation

2.1 Generalized Ohm’s law

Hall MHD is an extension of the standard MHD where the ion inertia is
retained in Ohm’s law. The generalized Ohm’s law, in SI unit, is then given

where E is the electric ﬁeld, V is the plasma ﬂow velocity, B is the magnetic
ﬁeld, J is the current density, n is the electron density, e is the magnitude
of the electron charge, µ0 is the permeability of free space and η is the
magnetic diﬀusivity. The Hall eﬀect, represented by the last term in the left
hand side of the generalized Ohm’s law, becomes relevant when we intend
to describe the plasma dynamics up to length scales shorter than the ion
inertial length di (di = c/ωpi, where c is the speed of light and ωpi is the
ion plasma frequency) and time scales of the order, or shorter, than the ion
cyclotron period ω−1
ci . It is one of the most important manifestations of the
velocity diﬀerence between electrons and ions when kinetic eﬀects are not
taken into account. The importance of the Hall eﬀect in astrophysics has
been pointed out to understand, for example, the presence of instabilities in
protostellar disks (Balbus and Terquem, 2001), the magnetic ﬁeld evolution
in neutron star crusts (Goldreich and Reisenegger, 1992; Cumming et al,
2004), impulsive magnetic reconnection (see e.g. Bhattacharjee, 2004) or the
formation of ﬁlaments (see e.g. Passot and Sulem, 2003; Dreher et al., 2005).

The Hall eﬀect appears in the induction equation as an additional term pro-
portional to the ion inertial length di which means that it is eﬀective when the
dynamical scale is small enough. In other words, for large scale phenomena
this term is negligible and we recover the standard MHD equations. In the

opposite limit, e.g. for very fast time scales (
ci ), ions do not have time to
follow electrons and they provide a static homogeneous background on which
electrons move. Such a model where the dynamics is entirely governed by
electrons is called the Electron MHD (EMHD) model (Kingsep et al., 1990;
Shukla and Stenﬂo, 1999). It can be recovered from Hall MHD by taking
the limits of small velocity V and large di. The Electron and Hall MHD ap-
proximations are particularly relevant in the context of collisionless magnetic
reconnection where the diﬀusion region develops multiscale structures corre-
sponding to ion and electron characteristic lengths (Huba, 1995; Biskamp,
1997). For example, it is often considered that whistler/EMHD turbulence
may act as a detector for magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause (Cai
et al., 2001).

with A the vector potential (B =

, which is not conserved anymore when
the Hall term is present in the MHD equations. The generalized hybrid
helicity can be seen as the product of two generalized quantities, a vector
potential Υ = A + diV and a vorticity Ω = B + di∇ ×
V. The role played
by the generalized vorticity is somewhat equivalent to the one played by the
magnetic ﬁeld in standard MHD (Woltjer, 1958).
Indeed, both quantities
obey the same Lagrangian equation, which is for Ω,

By applying the Helmholtz’s law (see e.g. Davidson, 2001) to Hall MHD, we
see that the generalized vorticity lines are frozen into the plasma (see e.g.
Sahraoui et al., 2003). The presence of the Hall term breaks such a property
for the magnetic ﬁeld which is however still frozen but only in the electron
ﬂow: the introduction of the electron velocity Ve, with V

which proves the statement. We will see below that the detailed conservation
of invariants is the ﬁrst test that the wave kinetic equations have to satisfy.

2.4

Incompressible Hall MHD waves

One of the main eﬀects produced by the presence of the Hall term is that the
linearly polarized Alfv´en waves, solutions of the standard MHD equations,
become circularly polarized and dispersive (see e.g. Mahajan and Krishan,
2005; Sahraoui et al., 2005). Indeed, if we linearize equations (2)–(5) around
a strong uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0 such that,

B(x) = B0 ˆek + ǫ b(x) ,

V(x) = ǫ v(x) ,

with ǫ a small parameter (0 < ǫ

polarization Λ tells us if the wave is right (Λ = s) or left (Λ =
polarized.
In the ﬁrst case, we are dealing with whistler waves, whereas
in the latter case with ion cyclotron waves. We see that the transverse
circularly polarized Alfv´en waves are dispersive and we note that we recover
the two well-known limits, i.e. the pure whistler waves (ω = skkkdiB0) in
), and the standard Alfv´en waves (ω =
the high frequency limit (kdi → ∞
skkB0) in the low frequency limit (kdi →
0). The Alfv´en waves become
linearly polarized only when the Hall term vanishes: when the Hall term is
present, whatever its magnitude is, the Alfv´en waves are circularly polarized.
Note that this situation is diﬀerent from the compressible case for which the
Alfv´en waves are elliptically polarized. As expected, it is possible to show
(Hameiri et al., 2005; Sahraoui et al., 2005) that the ion cyclotron wave has
a resonance at the frequency ωcikk/k, where ωci = B0/di. Therefore, with
such an approximation, only whistler waves survive at high frequency.

2.5 Complex helicity decomposition

Given the incompressibility constraints (13) and (16), it is convenient to
project the Hall MHD equations in the plane orthogonal to k. We will use
the complex helicity decomposition technique which has been shown to be
eﬀective in providing a compact description of the dynamics of 3D incom-
pressible ﬂuids (Craya, 1958; Moﬀatt, 1970; Kraichnan, 1973; Cambon et al.,
1989; Lesieur, 1990; Waleﬀe, 1992; Turner,2000; Galtier, 2003; Galtier and
Bhattacharjee, 2003). The complex helicity basis is also particularly useful

10

since it allows to diagonalize systems dealing with circularly polarized waves.

3.1 Fundamental equations

We decompose the inviscid nonlinear Hall MHD equations (14)–(15) on the

Equation (36) is the wave amplitude equation from which it is possible to
extract some information. As expected we see that the nonlinear terms are of
order ǫ. This means that weak nonlinearities will modify only slowly in time
the Hall MHD wave amplitude. They contain an exponentially oscillating
term which is essential for the asymptotic closure. Indeed, wave turbulence
deals with variations of spectral densities at very large time, i.e. for a non-
linear transfer time much greater than the wave period. As a consequence,
most of the nonlinear terms are destroyed by phase mixing and only a few of
them, the resonance terms, survive (see e.g. Newell et al., 2001). The expres-
sion obtained for the fundamental equation (36) is usual in wave turbulence.
The main diﬀerence between problems is localized in the matrix L which is
interpreted as a complex geometrical coeﬃcient. We will see below that the
local decomposition allows to get a polar form for such a coeﬃcient which
is much easier to manipulate. From equation (36) we see eventually that,
contrary to incompressible MHD, there is no exact solutions to the nonlinear
problem in incompressible Hall MHD. The origin of such a diﬀerence is that
in MHD the nonlinear term involves Alfv´en waves traveling only in opposite
directions whereas in Hall MHD this constrain does not exist (we have a
summation over Λ and s). In other words, if one type of wave is not present
in incompressible MHD then the nonlinear term cancels whereas in incom-
pressible Hall MHD it is not the case. The conclusion reached by Mahajan
ξs
and Krishan (2005) is therefore not correct: the condition
ΛBΛ does
not correspond to a nonlinear solution of incompressible Hall MHD.

3.2 Local decomposition

In order to evaluate the scalar products of complex helical vectors found in
the geometrical coeﬃcient (37), it is convenient to introduce a vector basis
local to each particular triad (Waleﬀe, 1992; Turner, 2000; Galtier, 2003;
Galtier and Bhattacharjee, 2003). For example, for a given vector p, we
deﬁne the orthonormal basis vectors,

ˆO(1)(p) = ˆn ,
ˆO(2)(p) = ˆep ×
ˆO(3)(p) = ˆep ,

ˆn ,

where ˆep = p/

and

We see that the vector ˆn is normal to any vector of the triad (k,p,q) and
changes sign if p and q are interchanged, i.e. ˆn(k,q,p) =
ˆn(k,p,q). Note that
ˆn does not change by cyclic permutation, i.e. , ˆn(k,q,p) = ˆn(q,p,k) = ˆn(p,k,q).
A sketch of the local decomposition is given in Fig. 1. We now introduce the
vectors

Equation (47) is the fundamental equations that describe the slow evolution
of the Alfv´en wave amplitudes due to the nonlinear terms of the incom-
pressible Hall MHD equations. It is the starting point for deriving the wave
kinetic equations. The local decomposition used here allows us to represent
concisely complex information in an exponential function. As we will see, it
will simplify signiﬁcantly the derivation of the wave kinetic equations.

From equation (47) we note that the nonlinear coupling between helicity
states associated with wavevectors, p and q, vanishes when the wavevectors
are collinear (since then, sin ψk = 0). This property is similar to the one
found in the limit of EMHD (Galtier and Bhattacharjee, 2003).
It seems
to be a general property for helicity waves (Kraichnan,1973; Waleﬀe, 1993;
Turner, 2000; Galtier, 2003). Additionally, we note that the nonlinear cou-
pling between helicity states vanishes whenever the wavenumbers p and q
are equal if their associated wave and directional polarities, Λp, Λq, and sp,
sq respectively, are also equal. In the case of whistler (EMHD) waves, for
which we have Λ = s (right circularly polarized), this property was already
observed (Galtier and Bhattacharjee, 2003). Here we generalize this ﬁnding
to right and left circularly polarized waves. In the large scale limit, i.e. when
we tend to pure incompressible MHD, this property tends to disappear. For
pure incompressible MHD, where Alfv´en waves are linearly polarized, this
is not observed anymore. As noticed before, the nature of the polarization
seems to be fundamental.

We are interested by the long-time behavior of the Alfv´en wave ampli-
tudes. From the fundamental equation (47), we see that the nonlinear wave

16

coupling will come from resonant terms such that,

The resonance condition may also be written:

As we will see below, the relations (54) are useful in simplifying the wave
kinetic equations and demonstrating the conservation of ideal invariants. In
particular, we note that we recover the resonance conditions for whistler
waves by taking the appropriate limit.

3.3 Dynamics and wave kinetic equations

Fully developed wave turbulence is a state of a system composed of many
simultaneously excited and interacting nonlinear waves where the energy dis-
tribution, far from thermodynamic equilibrium, is characterized by a wide
power law spectrum. This range of wavenumbers, the inertial range, is gen-
erally localized between large scales at which energy is injected in the system
and small dissipative scales. The origin of wave turbulence dates back to the
early sixties and since then many papers have been devoted to the subject
(see e.g. Hasselmnan, 1962; Benney and Saﬀman, 1966; Zakharov, 1967; Ben-
ney and Newell, 1969; Sagdeev and Galeev, 1969; Kuznetsov, 1972; Zakharov
et al.; 1992; Newell et al., 2001). The essence of weak wave turbulence is the
statistical study of large ensembles of weakly interacting dispersive waves
via a systematic asymptotic expansion in powers of small nonlinearity. This
technique leads ﬁnally to the derivation of wave kinetic equations for quan-
tities like the energy and more generally for the quadratic invariants of the
system studied. Here, we will follow the standard Eulerian formalism of wave
turbulence (see e.g. Benney and Newell, 1969).

We deﬁne the density tensor qs

Λ(k) for an homogeneous turbulence, such

that:

Λ(k) as′
as

Λ′(k′)

h

i ≡

Λ(k) δ(k + k′) δΛΛ′ δss′ ,
qs

(55)

for which we shall write a “closure” equation. The presence of the delta δΛΛ′
and δss′ means that correlations with opposite wave or directional polarities

17

have no long-time inﬂuence in the wave turbulence regime; the third delta
distribution δ(k + k′) is the consequence of the homogeneity assumption.
It is strongly linked to the form of the frequency ωs
Λ (see the discussion in
Section 4.5). Details of the derivation of the wave kinetic equations are given
in Appendix B. We obtain the following result:

describes the statistical properties of incompressible Hall MHD wave turbu-
lence at the lowest order, i.e. for three-wave interactions.

4 General properties of Hall MHD wave tur-

bulence

4.1 Triadic conservation of ideal invariants

In section 2.3, we have introduced the 3D ideal invariants of incompressible
Hall MHD. The ﬁrst test that the wave kinetic equations have to satisfy is
the detailed conservation of these invariants, that is to say, the conservation
of invariants for each triad (k, p, q). Starting from deﬁnitions (6)–(8), we
note that the Fourier spectra of the ideal invariants are:

Total energy is conserved exactly on the resonant manifold since then Ωk,pq =

between them is conserved by the wave kinetic equations. With relation

which is exactly equal to zero on the resonant manifold: we have triadic
conservation of the diﬀerence between magnetic and global helicity. The
last suﬃcient step would be to show detailed conservation for one of the
two helicities. Unfortunately it is not so trivial and we will not give the
proof here. However, we note already that magnetic helicity is conserved for
equilateral triangles (k = p = q), i.e. for strongly local interactions.

4.2 General properties

From the wave kinetic equations (56), we ﬁnd several general properties.
Some of them can be obtained directly from the wave amplitude equation
(47) as explained in Section 3.2. First, we observe that there is no coupling
between Hall MHD waves associated with wavevectors, p and q, when the
wavevectors are collinear (sin ψk = 0). Second, we note that there is no
coupling between helical waves associate with these vectors whenever the
magnitudes, p and q, are equal if their associated polarities, sp and sq in
one hand and, Λp and Λq on the other hand, are also equal (since then,
ξsq
ξsp
Λp = 0). These properties hold for the three inviscid invariants and
Λq −
generalize what was found previously in EMHD (Galtier and Bhattacharjee,
2003) where we only have right circularly polarized waves (Λ = s). It seems to
be a generic property of helical wave interactions (Kraichnan,1973; Waleﬀe,
1993; Turner, 2000; Galtier, 2003). As noted before, this property tends to
disappear when the large scale limit is taken, i.e. when we tend to standard
MHD. Third, it follows from the previous observations that a strong helical
perturbation localized initially in a narrow band of wavenumbers will lead
to a weak transfer of energy, magnetic and global helicities. Note that these
properties can be inferred from the fundamental equation (47) as well.

4.3 High frequency limit of electron MHD

In the present section we shall demonstrate that the small scale limit (dik

) of the wave kinetic equations (56) tends to the expected equations of
electron MHD when only right (Λ = s) circularly polarized waves are taken
into account. We recall that, in the small scale limit, ξs

where Ωk,pq = B0 di(skkk

exactly the same form as in Galtier and Bhattacharjee (2003) (where by
deﬁnition ωs
s = s ωk, B0 = 1 and di = 1) who derived a wave turbulence
theory for electron MHD (see the discussion in Section 5). In particular, this
means that by recovering the electron MHD description from the present
Hall MHD theory, we recover all the properties already found for whistler
wave turbulence (anisotropy, scaling laws, direct cascade...). We will come
back to that point in Section 5. Note ﬁnally that there is a strong analogy
between such a limit and wave turbulence in rapidly rotating ﬂows (Galtier,
2003; Bellet et al., 2005; Morize et al., 2005). The physical reason is that
in both problems (i) there is a privileged direction, played by the rotating
axis or the magnetic ﬁeld B0, (ii) there are dispersive helical waves, called
inertial waves for rotating ﬂows, and (iii) the wave frequencies are not very
diﬀerent, i.e. the inertial wave frequency is proportional to kk/k. In the past,
comparisons have been made between incompressible rotating turbulence and
magnetized plasmas described by incompressible MHD. The results obtained
in the framework of wave turbulence show clearly that the comparison is
much more relevant if one considers electron MHD plasmas. Indeed, a small
nonlinear transfer is found along the privileged direction for rotating and
electron MHD turbulence whereas this kind of transfer is strictly forbidden
in MHD turbulence.

4.5 Low frequency limit of standard MHD

This section is devoted to the low frequency limit, i.e. the large scale limit, of
the wave kinetic equations (56) of Hall MHD. The MHD limit is somewhat
singular for Hall MHD. Indeed the large scale limit does not tend to the
expected wave kinetic equations that were derived ﬁrst by Galtier et al.
for pseudo-dispersive
(2000). The subtle point resides in the kinematics:
MHD waves, the deﬁnition (55) of the density tensor qs
Λ(k) that is used
for Hall MHD is not valid anymore. The reason is that in the large scale
limit the polarization Λ does not appear anymore in the frequency, which is
ω = skkB0. Then the kinematics tells us that the deﬁnition for the density
tensor is

Indeed, helicity terms involve quantities for which Λ =
energy involves only terms for which Λ = Λ′. However, energies for shear-
Alfv´en waves and pseudo-Alfv´en waves involve terms with diﬀerent polarities.

We see clearly that if, in the wave kinetic equations, we only take into ac-
count (quadratic) terms with the same polarizations (Λ) then it is equivalent
to assume equality between shear- and pseudo-Alfv´en wave energies. We
will see below that the large scale limit of the wave kinetic equations (56)
of Hall MHD tends to the expected MHD counterpart when the previous
assumptions about helicities and energies are satisﬁed. A derivation of the
wave kinetic equations is given in Appendix C. The result is given for the
density tensor qss′
ΛΛ′. Contrary to Hall MHD, and actually to any problem
in wave turbulence, principal value terms appear for incompressible MHD.
The reason of the presence of principal value terms is linked to the nature of
Alfv´en waves which are pseudo-dispersive.

Further comparisons between the results in Appendix C and the wave
kinetic equations obtained by Galtier et al. (2000) are of course possible (see
e.g. the discussion in Section 5) but, for simplicity, we prefer to focus our
attention to the case where the density tensor is symmetric in Λ. Therefore
we start our analysis with the general kinetic equation (56) and take the
large scale limit (dik

0) for which we have, at the leading order, ξs

Λdik/2. After some simpliﬁcations, we arrive at:

This result is exactly the same as in Appendix D when MHD wave kinetic
equations are considered in the particular case where only terms symmetric
in Λ are retained, i.e. terms like ˜qss
ΛΛ. Therefore under these assumptions the
MHD description does not appear like a singular limit for Hall MHD. (Note
that this continuity in the description is a priori not so trivial if we remember
that as soon as the Hall term is included in the standard MHD equations,
whatever its magnitude is, it changes the polarity of the Alfv´en waves which
become circularly polarized.)

The comparison with the wave kinetic equations derived by Galtier et
al. (2000) (see equations (26)) is not direct since here the problem has been
decomposed at the origin on a complex helicity basis. The main signature of
this decomposition is the dependency on the wave polarity Λ. In spite of this
diﬃculty, a common point is clearly seen in the presence of the delta δ(qk)
which arises because of the three-wave frequency resonance condition. This
means that in any triadic resonant interaction, there is always one wave that
corresponds to a purely 2D motion (qk = 0) whereas the two others have
equal parallel components (pk = kk). The direct consequence is the absence
of nonlinear transfer along B0, a result predicted earlier by several authors
(see e.g. Montgomery and Turner, 1981; Shebalin et al., 1983).
In other
words, we have a two-dimensionalization of the Alfv´en wave turbulence (see
also e.g. Ng and Bhattacharjee, 1997; Lithwick and Goldreich, 2003).

5 Master equations of Hall MHD turbulence

5.1 General case

In order to extract further information about Hall MHD turbulence, we are
going to write the expression of the spectral density qs
Λ(k) in terms of the

24

invariants. In practice, we need to add a fourth variable, Ed, which has been
chosen to be the diﬀerence between the kinetic and magnetic energy, namely

Note that contrary to the MHD case, wave turbulence in Hall MHD allows
to have a departure from equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy
and therefore a non trivial value for Ed. We will see, in Section 7, that
this property is fundamental to get non trivial nonlocal interactions between
waves. It is possible to inverse the system qs

The introduction of expression (74) into (56) leads to the wave kinetic equa-
tions for E, Ed, Hm and HG. We will not make such a lengthy development
and we will rather focus on the master equations which drive the Hall MHD
turbulence.
Indeed, because of the presence of the factor Λ in expression
(74), we see that the nonlinear terms with diﬀerent polarities will not play
the same role. In particular, for the wave kinetic equations of energies, only
the interactions between nonlinear terms involving either energies or helici-
ties will give a contribution. For the wave kinetic equations of helicities, we
only have contributions from nonlinear terms involving energies and helici-
ties. Thus the energy equations are the master equations driving Hall MHD
turbulence. In other words, this means that an initial state with zero helic-
ity will not generate any helicity at any scale. However, an initial state of
zero helicity does not preclude the development of energy spectra. Assum-
ing Hm(k) = 0 and HG(k) = 0, the master kinetic equations of Hall MHD
turbulence, written for the kinetic energy EV and the magnetic energy EB,
are

In Appendix E the equivalent kinetic equations for the variables E and Ed are

very diﬀerent and that the master equations can be simpliﬁed further.

nonlinear contributions. This is not in contradiction with what we know
if we remember that the velocity in the original Hall MHD equations is a
combination of the ion and electron velocities. In the EMHD limit, i.e. in
the small spatio-temporal scale limit, this velocity tends to be small:
ions
do not have time to follow electrons and they provide a static homogeneous
background on which electrons move. Since the magnetic ﬁeld is frozen
into the ideal electron ﬂow (see Section 2.3 for the proof) we understand

why the magnetic energy is the dominant contribution to the wave kinetic

at leading order, exactly the same form as in Galtier and Bhattacharjee
(2003) (where ωs
s = s ωk and B0 = 1) but they are more general in the
sense that we have at our disposal not only an equation for the magnetic
ﬁeld, the dominant contribution, but also for the velocity that behaves like
the magnetic ﬁeld. The consequence is that we recover all the properties
already known. In particular, in such a regime the energy spectrum follows
the power law E(k⊥, kk)
(kk is assumed positive) which is an
exact solution of the wave kinetic equations.

i k2 ampliﬁes the
nonlinear contributions in the corresponding equation (see e.g. Mahajan and
Krishan, 2005). The physical reason is that in such a limit, we are mainly
dealing with ions whereas the magnetic ﬁeld is frozen into the ideal electron
ﬂow (see Section 2.3). Like for the EMHD limit, it is possible to derive
the exact power law solutions. First of all, we note that for strongly local

The wave kinetic equation (79) is now symmetric enough to apply a con-
formal transformation, called the Kuznetsov-Zakharov transformation. This
transformation, a two-dimensional generalization of the Zakharov transfor-
mation, has been applied in various anisotropic problems (Kuznetsov, 1972;
Balk et al. , 1990; Kuznetsov, 2001; Galtier and Bhattacharjee, 2003; Galtier,

The above collision integral vanishes for speciﬁc values of n and m. The exact
power law solutions correspond to these values. There are two diﬀerent kind
of solutions. The ﬂuxless solution, also called the thermodynamic equilibrium
solution, correspond to the equipartition state for which the ﬂux of energy is
zero. For this case, we have

This result can easily be checked by direct substitution in the original wave

tion (81) is the one for which the ﬂux is non-zero and ﬁnite. The exact
solution is called the Kuznetsov-Zakharov-Kolmogorov (KZK) spectrum and
corresponds to the values,

We note that the power law scaling found is the same as the one for whistler
wave turbulence. However here we are dealing with the kinetic energy not
the magnetic one. A necessary condition for the realizability of the KZK
spectra is that the turbulence be local in the sense that the behavior of the
turbulence is determined primarily (but not only) by interaction between
wave packets of comparable spatial scale (see e.g. [4]). To check a posteriori
the validity of the solutions, we need to determine the domain of locality,
i.e., the domain where the collision integral converges. In practice, we check
that the contribution of nonlocal interactions do not lead to a divergence of
the collision integral. Here, the condition of locality is automatically satisﬁed
since the anisotropic limit introduces in the problem a cut-oﬀ which prevents
any infra-red divergence of the collision integral. This characteristic is also
observed for internal gravity waves (Caillol and Zeitlin, 2000), inertial waves
(Galtier, 2003) and whistler waves (Galtier and Bhattacharjee, 2003). The
other consequence of the existence of such a cut-oﬀ is that it is not possible to
evaluate precisely the Kolmogorov constant, i.e. the prefactor of the spectra.
However, the sign of the energy transfer can be computed for a reasonable

29

range of cut-oﬀs. We observe a positive sign which means that we have a
direct energy cascade. Note that this information cannot be obtained through
a heuristic reasoning but only with a rigorous analysis.

standard MHD approximation for which the equipartition is in fact automat-
ically satisﬁed by the kinematics. The large scale limit of expression (75),

and the well known triangle relations. The angle ψq refers to the angle
opposite to q in the triangle deﬁned by k = p + q. (The same result can
actually be found directly from equation (72); the inversion of the system
made in section 5.1 is thus compatible with such a limit.) As noted before,
the large scale limit of Hall MHD leads to the particular case where helicities
are absent and where shear- and pseudo-Alfv´en wave energies are the same.
Equation (86) can be recovered from the general kinetic equations obtained
by Galtier et al. (2000) when the same assumptions are made. The proof
is given in Appendix F. Therefore, all the properties previously derived are
recovered (scaling laws, direction of the cascade, Kolmogorov constant...). In
k−2
⊥ f (kk),
particular, the energy spectrum follows the power law E(k⊥, kk)
where f is an arbitrary function that is due to the dynamical decoupling of
parallel planes in Fourier space. This is an exact solution of the wave kinetic
equations.

6 Anisotropic heuristic description for Hall

MHD

The study of wave turbulence in Hall MHD is a diﬃcult task. We have seen
above that for three speciﬁc limits we are able to ﬁnd the exact power law
energy spectra. Two of them (Alfv´en and whistler wave turbulence) were
already known and a heuristic description was given by Galtier et al. (2000)
and Galtier and Bhattacharjee (2003). We shall derive here a generalized
heuristic description able to recover the essential physics underlying the KZK
spectra including the ion cyclotron wave turbulence. However, note that
several phenomenologies may be used to take into account the various regimes
involving a non trivial balance between propagation and nonlinear eﬀects like
for standard MHD (see e.g. Zhou et al., 2004).

We introduce anisotropy in our description by considering that

The heuristic prediction proposed here is able to describe anisotropic tur-

small scale limit (k⊥di → ∞

as ion cyclotron wave turbulence and, in the large scale limit (k⊥di →
0),
the Alfv´en wave turbulence scaling law (since then the parallel wavenumber

32

is a mute variable). The prediction is given for the total energy, therefore
for the previous small scale limits one needs to consider only the magnetic or
the kinetic energy respectively. One may understand this point by looking at
equation (31) where the relation between the generalized Els¨asser variables,
the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld is given. In the small scale limit, we have

for the one-dimensional isotropic spectrum from which one recognizes the
Iroshnikov (1963) and Kraichnan (1965) prediction for MHD.

To summarize our ﬁnding we propose the picture given in Fig. 2.
It
is a sketch of the power law energy spectrum predictions for perpendicular
wavenumbers at a given kk. The energy spectrum of Hall MHD is character-
ized by two inertial ranges – the exact power law solutions of the wave kinetic
equations – separated by a knee. The position of the knee corresponds to
the scale where the Hall term becomes sub/dominant, i.e. when k⊥di ∼
1.
The heuristic prediction tries to make the link continuously (dashed line in
Fig. 2) between these power laws but the heuristic spectrum may not be
correct at intermediate scales since, in particular, Hall MHD turbulence is
not necessarily anisotropic. However, we will show, in Section 8, that even
at intermediate scales a moderate anisotropy is expected. The presence of
a knee in the solar wind spectrum is well attested by in situ measurements
of magnetic ﬂuctuations (Coroniti et al., 1982; Denskat et al., 1983, Leamon
et al., 1998; Bale et al., 2005). We will discuss about this point in Section
10; we will also comment the fact the comparison with observations is not
direct, in particular, for the high frequency part of the spectrum. One reason
is that the Taylor hypothesis, usually used at low frequency, is not applicable
anymore.

7 Nonlocal interactions

7.1

Introduction

Nonlocal interactions may play a signiﬁcant role in turbulence (see e.g. Laval
et al., 2001). By nonlocal interactions, we mean interactions between well-
separated scales. For triadic processes, it corresponds to the interaction of
two highly elongated wavevectors with a third small wavevector.
In Hall
MHD the study of nonlocal interactions and nonlocal transfers are particu-
larly interesting since the turbulent ﬂow behaves very diﬀerently at diﬀerent
scales (see Mininni et al., 2005). At the larger scales it follows the MHD
dynamics whereas at the smallest scales the ﬂow may follow, for example,
the EMHD dynamics. For simplicity, we will focus our analysis on the mas-
ter equations (75). Therefore we will neglect the helicity eﬀects and keep
only the kinetic and magnetic energy terms. According to the situation, we
p, q
will consider two diﬀerent kinds of nonlocal interactions, namely k
k, q (see Fig. 3). In practice, small scale and large scale eﬀects will
or p
be eﬀective when, respectively, the limits kdi →
0 will be
taken. Therefore, we see that large scale eﬀects (small wavenumbers) will be
driven by Alfv´en waves (A) whereas small scale eﬀects (large wavenumbers)
will be driven by whistler (W) or ion cyclotron (C) waves. Note that we
will not study nonlocal interactions between the same type of waves (AAA,

and kdi →

such a condition, three diﬀerent families of interactions may happen, namely
WWA, CCA and WCA. We describe below such interactions.

7.2 WWA interactions

First we shall consider the strongly nonlocal interactions of two whistler
waves on one Alfv´en wave. In other words, it means that the Alfv´en wave
will be supported by the wavevector k, with k
p, q. For such a limit the

A very interesting result is obtained: at leading order, the Alfv´en wave is
only aﬀected by small scale whistler waves when the local (i.e. at a given
wavevector k) equipartition between the alfv´enic kinetic and magnetic ener-
gies is broken, i.e. when EV (k)
= EB(k). Additionally, we see that these
nonlocal eﬀects are the same for the alfv´enic kinetic and the magnetic en-
ergies. This is not so trivial since whistler waves are described only by the
magnetic energy. We also note that the collisional integral is linearly depen-
dent on the diﬀerence between the large scale kinetic and magnetic energies
which can be extracted from the integral. These comments may be summa-

As before, at leading order the Alfv´en wave is only aﬀected by small scales
eﬀects when the local alfv´enic equipartition is broken. These small scale
eﬀects are only due to ion cyclotron waves. The reason of this apparent
asymmetry is actually due to the initial association between wavevectors
and waves (see below). We see that these nonlocal eﬀects are the same for
the alfv´enic kinetic and the magnetic energies. Once again, we note that the
collisional integral is linearly dependent on the diﬀerence between the large
scale kinetic and magnetic energies which can be extracted from the integral.

7.5 Discussion

We have seen that for any kind of nonlocal interactions (WWA, CCA or
WCA) a non trivial dynamics is present as long as the large scale kinetic
and magnetic energies are diﬀerent. This result reveals from the above de-
tail analysis is new and may explain some solar wind features.
Indeed at
ﬁrst sight, the solar wind may be seen as a MHD ﬂow where the kinetic and
magnetic energies are balanced. However, ﬂuctuations around this equipar-
tition state exist. The present work may explain how these ﬂuctuations are
maintained by small scales processes. Small scales may also be aﬀected by
what happens at the largest scales of the system. In this case Alfv´en waves
may be seen as a potential source of energy for small scales. We report in
Appendix G the result of the nonlocal analysis made on WCC interactions.

8 Source of anisotropy

8.1 Local interactions

In previous sections, we have seen three diﬀerent limits for which anisotropic
turbulence develops more or less strongly, i.e. the small scale limit, with right
or left polarization, and the large scale limit of Hall MHD. For intermediate
wavenumbers the situation is more diﬃcult to analyze.
Indeed, the wave
kinetic equations are in general too complex to give a simple answer. In this
section, we shall see what happens when strongly local interactions are only
taken into account. It is a situation where wavevectors have approximately
the same amplitude, i.e. k
q (we consider triangles, k = p + q,
approximately equilaterals). We are particularly interested by what happens
at intermediate scales.

≈

≈

p

Our analyze may start from the master equations (75). The hypothesis
of strongly local interactions does not lead to drastic simpliﬁcations; it seems
therefore more interesting to look at the resonance condition (54) that ap-
pears in equations (75). The ﬁrst case that we may investigate is the one for
which waves have the same polarization (left or right). After simpliﬁcations,
one ﬁnds the approximate relation

Necessarily two directional wave polarities will be equal which implies that
one of the parallel wavenumbers will be (approximately) equal to zero. In
other words,
local interactions between the same kind of waves lead to
anisotropic turbulence where small scales are preferentially generated per-
pendicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld.

The second case that we shall analyze is the one where we have local
interactions between waves with diﬀerent polarizations (left and right). Then
the resonance condition simpliﬁes to

Several combinations are possible. We note that for the particular case where
two waves have both the same polarization (left or right) and the same di-
rectional polarity, one parallel wavenumber will be (approximately) equal to
zero. Thus, such a situation leads to the same type of anisotropic turbulence
as before. A similar analysis applied to all the other cases does not lead to
such a conclusion: an isotropic turbulence may be generated by the nonlinear
dynamics.

The wave kinetic equations (75) are composed of a sum over the diﬀerent
polarities (Λ- and s-type). In other words, all the cases that we have men-
tioned above have to be taken into account to understand what happens for
strongly local interactions. Both the mechanisms leading to anisotropy and
isotropy are in competition and therefore it is likely that globally a moderate
anisotropy (less strong than what happens in the limits of large scale or small
scale Hall MHD) is generated at intermediate wavenumbers.

8.2 Discussion

The local interaction analysis gives some hints to understand globally the
nonlinear dynamics of wave turbulence in Hall MHD. It is also instructive

42

to analyze the opposite limit, namely the limit of strongly nonlocal interac-
tions. In Section 7, we have introduced the concept of nonlocal interactions
and discussed about some properties. Information about anisotropy can be
extracted from the diﬀerent cases analyzed. More precisely, one needs to
study the solution of the condition Ωk,pq = 0 that has to be satisﬁed at the
resonance. The general tendency that we observe (we will not give a de-
tail description of every cases) is that most of nonlocal interactions leads to
anisotropic turbulence where small scales are preferentially generated per-
pendicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld.

Both local and nonlocal interactions contribute to develop anisotropy
more or less strongly. Additionally, we know that a direct energy cascade is
predicted in the large scale limit (pure Alfv´en wave turbulence) as well as
in the small scale limit (whistler and ion cyclotron wave turbulence) of Hall
MHD. Thus it is expected that a turbulent anisotropic spectrum generated,
or developed, at large scale will spread out over wavenumbers, from kdi < 1
to kdi > 1, extending anisotropy to smaller scales. This scenario may be
applicable to the solar wind for which various indirect lines of evidence, at
low and high frequencies, show that waves propagate at large angles to the
background magnetic ﬁeld and that the power in ﬂuctuations parallel to the
background magnetic ﬁeld is much less than the perpendicular one (Coroniti
et al., 1982; Leamon et al., 1998).

9 Wave versus strong turbulence

9.1 Domain of validity of wave turbulence

Wave turbulence deals with asymptotic developments which are based on
a time scale separation, with a transfer time assumed to be much larger
than the wave period. A consequence of this assumption is that the the-
ory is not valid uniformly in all of k-space.
In this section, we are going
to evaluate the condition of validity of the present theory. Generally, one
needs to start with the wave kinetic equations for which exact power law
solutions exist. In our case, diﬀerent solutions have been found for diﬀerent
limits but in general – for intermediate wavenumbers – no solution has been
found. For that reason we are going to use a dimensional analysis and, in
particular, the heuristic spectrum derived in Section 6. This spectrum is
based on anisotropic arguments, therefore the condition that we are going to

43

write is only valid for anisotropic turbulence and might not be applicable at
intermediate wavenumbers.

We remind that the nonlinear time and the wave period are respectively

Equation (120) is the condition of validity of wave turbulence for Hall MHD
at the level of three-wave interactions. This condition is not in contradiction
kk) since the small parameter ǫ is
with the anisotropic assumption (k⊥ ≫
present. Thus we can always ﬁnd a domain of the k-space where the theory
is valid. We note, in particular, that for whistler and ion cyclotron wave
ǫ4/3k1/3
turbulence the condition of validity reduces, respectively, to kk ≫
⊥
and kk ≫
⊥ . We remind that it is an evaluation based on anisotropic
assumption and therefore it might not be valid at intermediate wavenumbers.
In the prohibited region (small kk) other higher-order processes such as four-
wave interaction have to be taken into account. Basically it is the domain
where strong turbulence occurs.

9.2 The two-dimensional state

The wave turbulence theory developed in this paper describes the Hall MHD
dynamics of three-dimensional incompressible waves. Indeed, the condition
of validity found previously shows that the two-dimensional state, i.e. modes
with kk = 0, is not described by the wave kinetic equations. Actually, if we
look at equations (56), we see that the nonlinear transfers decrease (linearly)
with kk. For the forbidden value kk = 0 the transfer is exactly null. We see
therefore that the two-dimensional – slow – modes decouple from the three-
dimensional Hall MHD waves. Such decoupling is not new; it is found in a
variety of problems like for internal gravity waves (see e.g. Phillips, 1969),
rotating stratiﬁed ﬂows (see e.g. Bartello, 1995) or pure rotating ﬂows (see
e.g. Smith and Waleﬀe, 1999).

As we have already noticed in Section 4.5 the MHD limit is somewhat
singular for Hall MHD. A signature of this singular behavior is the appear-
ance of principal value terms in the wave kinetic equations. The consequence
is that there is an important diﬀerence between Hall MHD and MHD: in the
latter case the two-dimensional modes drive the three-dimensional dynamics.
Therefore, in this particular case, we need information from the forbidden
region to describe the dynamics in the domain of applicability of wave tur-
bulence. Note that even in this case the wave turbulence theory at the level
of three-wave interactions has been shown to be applicable (Galtier et al.,
2000; Nazarenko et al., 2001, Bhattacharjee and Ng, 2001). For Hall MHD
in general, higher order processes like four-wave interactions may lead to a
coupling between the two-dimensional state and three-dimensional modes.

9.3 Strong Hall MHD turbulence

We shall derive now the equivalent heuristic prediction as in Section 6 but
for strong turbulence. We would like to compare, at least at the level of the
phenomenology, the wave and strong turbulence regimes.

We will assume that a moderate external magnetic ﬁeld B0 is applied

MHD as well as for intermediate wavenumbers. Contrary to the wave tur-

for the one-dimensional isotropic spectrum. It is interesting to note that the
EMHD prediction is the one found and observed in direct numerical simu-
lations by Biskamp et al. (1999). Note that the Kolmogorov scaling found
at large scales is an unavoidable result since we have used in fact the same
phenomenology as Kolmogorov. Note ﬁnally that the scaling law predic-
tions made for strong and wave turbulence in the presence of anisotropy may
be described in the context of the generalized critical balance proposed by
Galtier et al. (2005). In that context the solutions found here would be two
particular cases of a familly of solutions. The result obtained here has to
be contrasted with those obtained by Krishan and Mahajan (2004,2005) for
strong isotropic turbulence. In these papers, the authors give several predic-
tions separately for the magnetic and kinetic energy spectra. In particular,
they conclude that the whistler-type prediction is very diﬀerent from the ob-
servations and evoke a possible stronger damping for whistler waves. In the
present paper, it is thought that the damping (e.g. due to the resonance)
aﬀects mainly the ion cyclotron waves (see also Goldstein et al., 1994).

10 Conclusion

10.1 Summary

In this paper we have investigated the steepening of the magnetic ﬂuctua-
tion power law spectra observed in the solar wind for frequencies higher than
0.5 Hz. We have shown that the high frequency part of the spectrum may

46

be attributed to dispersive nonlinear processes present in the incompressible
Hall MHD equations rather than pure dissipation. In that context, we have
introduced the generalized Els¨asser variables adapted to Hall MHD and de-
veloped a wave turbulence formalism based on a complex helical decomposi-
tion. Then, we have derived the wave kinetic equations for three dimensional
incompressible Hall MHD turbulence at the level of three-wave interactions,
in the presence of a strong external magnetic ﬁeld, and in the most general
case, i.e. with global and magnetic helicities. In such a regime, Hall MHD
turbulence is mainly anisotropic with small scales preferentially generated
perpendicular to the external magnetic ﬁeld. In particular, strong anisotropy
is developed at small scales (ion cyclotron/IMHD and whistler/EMHD wave
turbulence) and large scales (pure Alfv´en/MHD wave turbulence). For inter-
mediate wavenumbers, i.e. kdi ≈
1 only a moderate anisotropy may happen.
We have found two diﬀerent power law energy spectra that are exact solutions
of the wave kinetic equations, with a steeper power law at smaller scales. To
illustrate this ﬁnding, we have developed an anisotropic phenomenology that
describes continuously the diﬀerent scaling laws for the energy spectrum: the
existence of a double inertial range is recovered with a knee at intermediate
scales where the Hall term becomes (sub-)dominant. We have also shown
that the large scale limit of Hall MHD, i.e. the standard MHD, is singular
and leads to the appearance of principal value terms in the wave kinetic equa-
tions. We have analyzed the nonlocal interactions between Alfv´en, whistler
and ion cyclotron waves and we have shown that, at leading order, a non
trivial dynamics is present only when a discrepancy from the equipartition
between the large scale kinetic and magnetic energies of Alfv´en waves hap-
pens. Finally, we have given the conditions of validity of wave turbulence in
Hall MHD and compared the wave and strong turbulence scaling laws.

10.2 Discussion

−

Solar wind magnetic ﬂuctuation power law spectra are commonly observed
5/3 at frequencies lower than 0.5Hz and a steeper
to have an index around
power law behavior at higher frequencies with a spectral index on average
around
3 (Coroniti et al., 1982; Denskat et al., 1983, Leamon et al., 1998).
The latest analysis made from Cluster spacecraft data has – however – re-
2.12 (Bale et al., 2005). These small scale
ported a spectral index about
ﬂuctuations are also characterized by a bias of the polarization suggesting
that they are likely to be right-hand polarized, outward propagating waves

−

−

47

(Goldstein et al., 1994). For these reasons, it is claimed that Alfv´en – left
circularly polarized – ﬂuctuations may be suppressed by proton cyclotron
damping and that the high frequency power law spectra are likely to consist
of whistler waves (see e.g. Stawicki et al., 2001). Additionally, it is often
observed that the high frequency ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld are much
smaller than the background magnetic ﬁeld (see e.g. Stawicki et al., 2001).
Therefore, a wave turbulence approach seems to be well adapted to this
problem. It is well known that whistler waves are solution to the Hall MHD
equations. We have seen in the regime of wave turbulence that when the
Hall term is added to the MHD equations a nontrivial dynamics happens
at small scales (i.e. when kdi > 1) with, in particular, a steepening of the
power law energy spectra. This behavior is similar to what is observed in
the solar wind and may be seen as an indication that the steepening of the
solar wind magnetic ﬂuctuation power law spectra is mainly due to nonlinear
processes rather than pure dissipation. Under this new interpretation, the
resistive dissipation range of frequencies may be moved to frequencies higher
than the electron cyclotron frequency.

The Taylor hypothesis, that allows to connect directly a frequency to
a wavenumber, is widely used to interpret the single spacecraft solar wind
data. It is thought that this approximation is well adapted to analyze, in
particular, the low frequency part of the magnetic and velocity ﬂuctuations.
The subsequent interpretation is mainly relevant for isotropic media. How-
ever, there are evidences that anisotropy is present in the solar wind at high
and low frequencies (see e.g. Belcher and Davis, 1971). From a theoretical
point of view, it is well known that the presence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld
inﬂuences the MHD turbulent ﬂows (see e.g. Pouquet, 1978; Montgomery
and Turner, 1981; Shebalin et al. 1983; Goldreich and Sridhar, 1995; Ng
and Bhattacharjee, 1996-1997; Galtier et al., 2000-2005). The main eﬀect is
that MHD turbulence becomes mainly bidimensional with a nonlinear trans-
fer essentially perpendicular to its direction. Direct numerical simulations
of 2 1
2D compressible Hall MHD for high and low beta β plasma (Ghosh and
Goldstein, 1997) have also displayed such an anisotropic property when a
strong magnetic ﬁeld is present. As we have seen, the model that we propose
here is also able to exhibit such an anisotropy. The predictions that we have
made are for anisotropic turbulence, i.e. a situation where we distinguish the
wavenumber k⊥ from kk. Therefore, a proper comparison with observational
data will be possible only when a three dimensional energy spectrum will be
accessible. It is important to note that average eﬀects may alter signiﬁcantly

48

∼

⊥ k−β

the power law scaling. An illustration of such eﬀects may be given from
the recent heuristic MHD predictions made by [39] who have generalized
the concept of critical balance. For a medium where a strong or moderate
magnetic ﬁeld B0ˆek is present, they predict the anisotropic energy spectrum
E(k⊥, kk)
k , with 3α + 2β = 7. This model is able to describe both
the strong and wave turbulence regimes as well as the transition between
k2/3
them; it also satisﬁes the critical balance relationship kk ∝
⊥ . It is very
interesting to note that if one averages the heuristic spectrum to obtain the
one dimensional counterpart E(k⊥), one obtains systematically a scaling law
in k−5/3
for any family of solutions (α, β). Actually, this remark might ex-
⊥
plain the apparent contradiction between, on the one hand, the presence of
5/3)
anisotropy in the solar wind and, on the other hand, the Kolmogorov (
scaling law for the low frequency energy spectrum. Of course, other explana-
tions of the 5/3–spectrum are possible; an example is given in Oughton and
Matthaeus (2005). The direct comparison between theoretical predictions
and in situ measurements of three dimensional energy spectra is particu-
larly crucial for the high frequency part of the power spectrum for which
the usual Taylor hypothesis that allows to connect directly the frequency to
the wavenumber is not applicable anymore. Eﬀorts are currently made with
Cluster spacecraft data from which it is possible to extract the three dimen-
sional magnetic turbulent spectra of the magnetosheath thanks to multipoint
measurements and a k-ﬁltering technique (see e.g. Sahraoui et al., 2004). As
explained in [3], Cluster spacecraft may exit from the terrestrial magneto-
sphere to make solar wind measurements. The application of the k-ﬁltering
technique to the high frequency part of the solar wind magnetic ﬂuctuations
seems then possible. It may lead, for the ﬁrst time, to a direct and rigorous
comparison with a model prediction of solar wind. Note that using multi-
spacecraft analysis, Matthaeus et al. (2005) have recently investigated some
spatial correlations from two-point measurements.

The model proposed in this paper is able to recover some solar wind prop-
erties but several aspects have not been discussed. For example, it would be
interesting to investigate the eﬀects of asymmetry, i.e. the fact that outward
propagating waves dominate in the solar wind. In the framework of incom-
pressible MHD, we know that asymmetry changes the index of the power
law spectra. Similarly, the indices found here may be aﬀected by asym-
metry; this question will be tackled in the future. In this paper, we have
found that a turbulent state made of ion cyclotron waves may exist around

49

a fraction of the ion cyclotron frequency ωci, namely for a frequency around
ωR = (kk/k) ωci. The presence of a resonance at a frequency ωR lower than
ωci is rarely discussed in the litterature (see White et al., 2002) since the
analysis is generally focused on parallel propagations (kk = k) for which the
resonance frequency is exactly the ion cyclotron frequency. As we have seen,
in the presence of a strong external magnetic ﬁeld, Hall MHD turbulence be-
comes mainly bidimensional with an energy spectrum mainly spreaded out
over the wavenumbers k⊥. In this case, the resonance frequency may appear
at a small fraction of ωci (this fraction being even smaller for heavier mass
ions). These remarks may be crucial to understand the solar coronal heating
problem in which the coronal temperature is far beyond what one can pre-
dict by the resistive MHD approximation: although the Hall MHD model is
a ﬂuid model that does not describe the resonance between waves and partic-
ules and therefore the particule heating, it oﬀers the possibility to evaluate
the rate of particule heating by assuming that the turbulent energy of ion
cyclotron waves are mainly transfer into heating. This point is currently in-
vestigated and will be reported elsewhere. In the context of the solar wind,
the measure of the position of the knee in the magnetic ﬂuctuation power
law spectrum may be seen as a proxy to measure the solar wind anisotropy.
The Hall eﬀect is relevant in many astrophysical problems to understand,
for example, the presence of instabilities in protostellar disks (Balbus and
Terquem, 2001), the magnetic ﬁeld evolution in neutron star crusts (Gol-
dreich and Reisenegger, 1992; Cumming et al, 2004) or impulsive magnetic
reconnection (see e.g. Bhattacharjee, 2004). Small scale turbulence is also
a key issue in a number of problems from the interstellar medium (see the
review made by [32], and, [95]), to solar physics (see e.g. , [85]), magneto-
spheric physics (see e.g. the recent paper by [46]) and laboratory devices such
as tokamaks (see e.g. Wild et al., 1981; Taylor, 1993). Therefore, it is likely
that the present model will interest several other (astrophysical) problems.

We shall write asymptotic closure (Newell et al., 2001) for our system. For
that, we basically need to write the fourth-order moment in terms of a sum of
the fourth-order cumulant plus products of second order ones. The asymp-
totic closure depends on two ingredients: the ﬁrst is the degree to which
the linear waves interact to randomize phases; the second relies on the fact
that the nonlinear regeneration of the third-order moment by the fourth-
order moment in equation (130) depends more on the product of the second
order moments than it does on the fourth order cumulant. The fourth–
order moment decomposes into the sum of three products of second–order
moments, and a fourth–order cumulant. The latter does not contribute to
secular behavior, and among the other products one is absent because of
the homogeneity assumption.
If we use the symmetric relations (49)–(52)
and perform wavevector integrations, summations over polarities and time
integration, then equation (130) becomes:

The last step that we have to follow to obtain the same expression as (56) is
to include the resonance relations (54) into the previous equations.

C Pseudo-dispersive MHD waves and com-

plex helical decomposition

This section is devoted to the derivation of the wave kinetic equations for
pure alfv´enic turbulence (kdi = 0). These equations were already derived by
Galtier et al. (2000) but here we use the complex helicity decomposition.
We will see that some diﬀerences appear in the kinematics that renders the
MHD description somewhat singular (principal value terms appear) by op-
position to the dispersive Hall MHD description. We start from the standard
incompressible and inviscid MHD equations,

We see that this decomposition is not natural for linear polarized Alfv´en
waves since for a given direction of propagation (a given s) we have two
contributions for each value of Λ. We nevertheless use this decomposition to
show the compatibility with the Hall MHD turbulence description. After the
substitution of (143) into (141)–(142), we obtain

Note that we do not have a summation over the directional polarity sp and sq.
The physical reason is that the nonlinear coupling in incompressible MHD
involves only Alfv´en waves propagating in opposite directions. Thus the
information about the direction of propagation is already taken into account
in equation (141). We use the local decomposition and ﬁnd after some algebra

Equation (145) is the fundamental equation that describes the slow evolu-
tion of the Alfv´en wave amplitudes due to the nonlinear terms of the incom-
pressible MHD equations. Note that (i) we have already used the resonance
condition to simplify the coeﬃcient in the complex exponential function; (ii)
a comparison with the large scale limit of equation (47) is possible if we sum
over the directional polarities. We follow the same steps as in Appendix B:
we write successively equations for the second and third-order moments,

The presence of the delta δss′ means that correlations with opposite polarities
have no long-time inﬂuence in the wave turbulence regime; the second delta
distribution δ(k + k′) is the consequence of the homogeneity assumption. We
note that the kinematics does not impose any condition about the polariza-
tion Λ. The reason is that Λ does not appear in the Alfv´en wave frequency.
This remark shows a fundamental diﬀerence with the Hall MHD case. As we
will see it is the reason why principal value terms appear in MHD but not

We see that principal value terms will appear in the long-time limit. The
reason is that the polarization Λ and Λ′ in the density tensor qss
ΛΛ′(k) are not
the same in general. Therefore we lose the symmetry between terms that we
had in the Hall MHD case (see Appendix B).

D Simpliﬁed MHD wave kinetic equations

symmetric in Λ are retained, i.e. terms like qss

Equations (160) are the wave kinetic equations for incompressible MHD tur-

when equality between shear- and pseudo-Alfv´en wave energies is assumed

F Compatibility with Galtier et al. (2000)

We start from equation (26) of Galtier et al. (2000). We assume that helici-
ties are absent (I s(k) = 0) and that shear- and pseudo-Alfv´en wave energies
are identical. We introduce the following notations:

(162)

Equations (166) are the wave kinetic equations for incompressible MHD tur-
bulence when helicities are absent and when equality between shear- and
pseudo-Alfv´en wave energies is assumed. The addition over the index s will
give the wave kinetic equations for the total energy.

G Nonlocal WCC interactions

We shall consider the strongly nonlocal interactions of two ion cyclotron
waves at small scales on one whistler wave at large scales. In other words,
it means that the whistler wave will be supported by the wavevector k, with
k
p, q. This type of interaction is the most interesting since smaller scales
may be reached more easily by ion cyclotron waves. For such a limit, the
master equations (75) reduce to

As expected, at leading order the whistler wave is described by the magnetic
energy. Contrary to the other cases studied before, a non trivial dynamics
happens as long as a discrepancy exists between the (kinetic) energy of the
ion cyclotron waves and the (magnetic) energy of the whistler wave.

We compare published results on ﬂare-storm dependences
and discuss possible sources of the discrepancy. We analyze
following sources of diﬀerence: (1) diﬀerent intervals of ob-
servations, (2) diﬀerent statistics and (3) diﬀerent methods of
event identiﬁcation and comparison. Our analysis shows that
magnitude of geomagnetic storms is likely to be independent
on X-ray class of solar ﬂares.

Abstract. Solar ﬂares are often used as precursors of geomagnetic storms. In particular, Howard and Tappin (2005) recently
published in A&A a dependence between X-ray class of solar ﬂares and Ap and Dst indexes of geomagnetic storms which
contradicts to early published results.

1. Introduction

One of the important aims of solar-terrestrial physics is investi-
gation of possible causes of geomagnetic storms on the Sun
and in the interplanetary space. Storms are primarily gener-
ated by large, long-duration southward component of interplan-
etary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) (Burton et al. 1975, Lyatsky and Tan
2003, Zhang et al. 2006) associated with interplanetary coronal
mass ejections (ICME - magnetic clouds and ejecta) and coro-
tating interaction regions (CIR) (see recent papers and reviews
by Gopalswamy et al. 2005, Kane 2005, Meloni et al. 2005,
Schwenn et al. 2005, Yermolaev et al. 2005, Yermolaev and
Yermolaev 2006, and references therein).

Solar ﬂares were one of the ﬁrst strong disturbances dis-
covered on the Sun and they were considered as the impor-
tant source of almost all interplanetary and geomagnetic dis-
turbances during long time. Later, in the beginning of 1970s,
other powerful solar processes such as coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) were discovered, and after the landmark paper by
Gosling (1993) the situation has signiﬁcantly changed, and
now CME is considered almost as the unique cause of all in-
terplanetary and geomagnetic disturbances (see recent reviews
by Schwenn et al. 2005, Yermolaev et al. 2005 and references
therein). Nevertheless the solar ﬂares are often considered as a
precursor of solar activity and used for prediction of interplan-
etary and geomagnetic disturbances (see recent papers by Park
et al. 2002, Yermolaev et al. 2005 and references therein).

Recently a statistic study of interplanetary shocks and ac-
companying events on the Sun and in the magnetosphere for
1998-2004 was published by Howard and Tappin (2005). In
particularly there is Fig.7 showing a dependence between class
of solar ﬂares (X-ray measurements on GOES satellites) and
value of geomagnetic storms (Ap and Dst indexes) with statis-
tics of 103 pairs of events. On the basic of these data the au-
thors indicated ”a tendency for large ﬂares to be associated with
very large storms”. This is very strong contention because if it

would be true the class of solar ﬂares could be used not only
to predict an occurrence of magnetic storm but also to predict
a magnitude of it. Unfortunately authors (Howard and Tappin
2005) did not compare this result with results of other papers.
So, the aim of this paper is to compare this result with another
published results on this topic.

2. Observations

Published results on ﬂare-storm dependence are presented in
the table. Shrivastava and Singh (2002) and Howard and Tappin
(2005) initially selected CME-magnetosphere pairs of events
and then analyzed relation between classes (respectively, optic
class in 1st paper and X-ray class in 2nd paper) of accompany-
ing ﬂares and magnetospheric disturbances (Ap index in 1st pa-
per and Ap and Dst indexes in 2nd paper). Howard and Tappin
(2005) addinionally selected events accompanied by interplan-
etary shocks. Although correlations between optic and X-ray
classes of ﬂares and between various geomagnetic indexes are
suﬃcient low (Yermolaev and Yermolaev 2003b), these papers
say in favor of existence dependence between ﬂare class and
storm magnitude.

Similar analysis of solar,

interplanetary and magneto-
spheric events for 1976-2000 had been published by Yermolaev
and Yermolaev (2003a) (see also preliminary publication by
Yermolaev and Yermolaev 2002a) where the same depen-
dence had been presented (see Fig.5 in paper by Yermolaev
and Yermolaev 2003a). The dependence of magnitude of 325
storms on X-ray class (≥ M5) of solar ﬂares was presented
on top panel of the ﬁgure 5 in the paper and the same de-
pendence for 70 ﬂares (≥ M0) accompanied by Solar Particle
Events (SPEs) - on bottom panel. In two panels the data have
been selected with (1) location of solar ﬂare on solar disc - west
(open symbols) and east (closed), and (2) time delayed between
ﬂare and corresponding storm - 2 - 4 days (high probability
of event relation, triangles), 1.5-2 and 4-5 days (intermediate
probability, rhombs), and 1-1.5 and 5-6 days (low probability,

circles). No tendency of increase in value of storms with in-
creasing class of solar ﬂares was observed.

Thus two diﬀerent results were obtained in diﬀerent stud-
ies. Possible causes of this diﬀerence will be discussed in next
section of paper.

3. Discussion

Two papers, which indicate the existence of ﬂare-storm relation
(Shrivastava and Singh 2002 and Howard and Tappin 2005),
have common feature in method of data selection (This fea-
ture is absent in papers by Yermolaev and Yermolaev 2002a,
2003a): initial selection of CME-magnetosphere pairs of events
and consequent analyses of relation between classes of accom-
panying ﬂare and magnetospheric disturbances. So, necessary
condition of existence of ﬂare-storm relation is likely to be ex-
istence of CME-storm relation. This condition is not clearly
stated in papers by Shrivastava and Singh (2002) and Howard
and Tappin (2005) and this hypothesis requires further investi-
gations.

It is diﬃcult to compare results of papers by Shrivastava
and Singh (2002) and Yermolaev and Yermolaev (2002a,
2003a) because they were obtained with use of abso-
lutely diﬀerent methods of event deﬁnition and classiﬁcation.
Nevertheless, several considerations, which will be applied be-
low to comparison of results in papers by Howard and Tappin
(2005) and Yermolaev and Yermolaev (2002a, 2003a), may be
of interest in future data analyses.

In addition to mentioned above methodical diﬀerence (ini-
tial selection of CME-magnetosphere pairs of events) in pa-
pers by Shrivastava and Singh (2002) and Yermolaev and
Yermolaev, (2002a, 2003a) there are three main possible causes
of discrepancy: (1) diﬀerent intervals of analysis, (2) diﬀer-
ent statistics and (3) diﬀerent methods of event identiﬁcation
and comparison. Yermolaev and Yermolaev (2003a) studied
25-year interval (more than 2 solar cycles from 1976 up to
2000) while Howard and Tappin (2005) investigated only 7-
year interval near maximum of 23-rd solar cycle (1998-2004).
As well known, the magnetic storms are generated by diﬀer-
ent types of solar wind disturbances (magnetic clouds, MC,
or corotating interaction regions, CIR, which are generated by
CME or fast streams from coronal hole, respectively) during
diﬀerent phases of solar cycle (see, for instance, Fig. 6 in paper
by Yermolaev and Yermolaev 2002b). It is possible to suggest
that averaging data over solar cycle could mask indicated de-
pendence but this hypothesis requires further investigations.

The higher statistics in paper by Yermolaev and Yermolaev
(2003a) indicate in favour of absence of storm dependence
on class of ﬂare. For instance, extremely strong geomagnetic
storm on March, 1989 (Dst = -589 nT) can be associated with
large (but not extremely large) ﬂares with class X1-X5 and this
event does not agree with suggested ﬂare-storm relation.

As has been shown (Yermolaev et al., 2005, Yermolaev
and Yermolaev 2003a, 2006) result of comparison of diﬀerent
events on the Sun, in the interplanetary space and in the geo-
magnetosphere strongly depends on methods of event identi-
ﬁcation and comparison procedures. Unfortunately methodical
problems related to dependence under study are very schemat-
ically discussed in paper by Howard and Tappin (2005) and it
makes impossible to search for cause of result discrepancy in
features of methods.

Available data allow us to discuss only problem of selection
of ﬂares with various classes for comparison with magnetic
storms. Howard and Tappin (2005) included C-class ﬂares in
the analysis. As well known CMEs (not ﬂares) generated in-
terplanetary disturbances and then magnetic storms (Gosling
1993), and ﬂares can be used only as indicator of solar activ-
ity which can result in CMEs and interplanetary disturbances.
On the other hand, association ﬂares and CMEs decreases with
decreasing class of ﬂares (Kahler et al. 1989). In recent paper
by Yashiro et al. (2005) 15% and 30% ﬂare-CME associations
were obtained respectively for disc and limb ﬂares with class
range of C3-M1. So, C-class ﬂares, included by Howard and
Tappin (2005) in analysis, could not improve correlation be-
tween class of ﬂares and Dst index during magnetic storms.

4. Conclusions

Thus, our analysis of published results allows one to make pre-
liminary conclusions.

1. There is no any correlation between X-ray class of so-
lar ﬂares and magnitude of corresponding geomagnetic
storms.

2. If one selects initially CMEs and corresponding geomag-
netic storm and then solar ﬂares accompanying CMEs, for
solar ﬂares obtained by this way a slight positive correlation
between these parameters is likely to be observed.

Such a correlation would be very important for space
weather prediction and reliability of it requests further inves-
tigations.

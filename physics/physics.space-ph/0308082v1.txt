Abstract.

The Solar Maximum Mission satellite’s Gamma Ray Spectrometer spent much of its
1980–1989 mission pointed at Earth, accumulating spectra of atmospheric albedo γ-rays.
Its 28◦ orbit ensured that a range of geomagnetic latitudes was sampled. We measured
the variation with time and cutoﬀ rigidity of some key γ-ray lines which are diagnos-
tic of the intensity of the Galactic cosmic radiation penetrating the geomagnetic cutoﬀ
and of the secondary neutrons produced in the atmosphere. We found that the inten-
sities of nuclear lines at 1.6 MeV, 2.3 MeV and 4.4 MeV varied inversely with solar ac-
tivity in cycles 21–22 as expected from the theory of solar modulation of cosmic rays.
They were found to be strongly anticorrelated with cutoﬀ rigidity, as expected from the
theory of the cutoﬀ, falling by a factor ∼ 3.6 between the lowest (< 7 GV) and high-
est (> 13 GV) rigidities sampled. The solar cycle modulation was particularly marked
at the lowest rigidities, reaching an amplitude of 16%.

The ratios of the intensities of the lines produced by nuclear de-excitation (1.6 MeV,

2.3 MeV) and those from nuclear spallation (4.4 MeV) did not vary with either solar
activity or cutoﬀ rigidity, indicating that the shape of the secondary neutron spectrum
in the atmosphere above 5 MeV was approximately constant over the times and regions
sampled. If it is approximated by a power law in energy, we derive constraints on the
absolute value of the power law index ∼ −1.15 – -1.45 and better constraints on its vari-
ability, ≤ 5% over a solar cycle, and ≤ 6% over SMM ’s range of sampled cutoﬀ rigidi-
ties.

We also measured the intensity of the electron-positron annihilation line at 0.511 MeV.

This line also varies with the solar cycle, but its variation with cutoﬀ rigidity is weaker
than that of the nuclear lines, falling by a factor 2 (rather than 3.6) over SMM ’s range
of sampled cutoﬀ rigidities. This can be understood in terms of the energy dependences
of the cross sections for positron production and for the hadronic interactions which pro-
duce secondary neutrons.

1. Introduction

A signiﬁcant contribution to the radiation environment
in low Earth orbit (LEO) consists of γ-radiation emitted
by the atmosphere. These so-called albedo photons are
the ultimate products of impacts by high energy cosmic
ray particles on the nuclei of atoms in the upper atmo-
sphere. Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld shields these layers to some
extent from charged particles, especially the relatively soft-
spectrum ﬂux of protons from the Sun. The more energetic
particles in the Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) are there-
fore responsible for the long-term quiescent atmospheric γ-
radiation, away from times of discrete solar ﬂaring and coro-
nal mass ejection events.

The intensity of the quiescent γ-ray ﬂux is expected to
vary both spatially and temporally as a result of modu-

lation of the GCR ﬂux. The latitudinal variation of the
geomagnetic ﬁeld imposes a cutoﬀ on the cosmic ray spec-
trum corresponding to the vertical rigidity cutoﬀ, while the
11-year solar magnetic activity cycle modulates the overall
incoming GCR ﬂux in an inverse sense.

Early observations of Earth’s γ-ray line spectrum were
largely made during balloon ﬂights, which could not achieve
wide spatial or temporal coverage. Ling [1976] discussed
these measurements and presented model source functions
for lines independent of time and at ﬁxed latitude. Two
satellite missions provided much better coverage, and were
much more sensitive than the balloon experiments. These
were HEAO 3 during 1979–1980, whose results were re-
ported by Mahoney et al. [1981] and Willett and Mahoney
[1992] (treating the strong 0.511 MeV electron-positron an-
nihilation line, and six strong lines from nuclear interactions,
respectively) and the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), from
which results are reported in this paper.

The Gamma Ray Spectrometer experiment (GRS) on
board SMM was active during 1980–1989 in LEO and was

heavily exposed to Earth atmosphere γ-radiation. It sam-
pled a broad range of the parameters which aﬀected this
◦
radiation; its orbital inclination of 28
intercepted geomag-
netic cutoﬀ rigidity values between 5–15 GV, and its 10-year
lifetime covered the second half of solar cycle 21 and the ﬁrst
half of cycle 22. The HEAO 3 experiment was also in LEO,
but at a higher inclination, covering a wider range of cutoﬀ
rigidities; it had ﬁner spatial and energy resolution than the
GRS, but its lifetime was only 9 months and it was some-
what less sensitive than the GRS.

A spectrum accumulated by SMM during the ﬁrst 3 1
2
years of the mission at low cutoﬀ rigidities was presented by
Letaw et al. [1989], and extended to cover the entire mission
by Share and Murphy [2001], by whom some 20 broad and
narrow lines were detected and identiﬁed with known lines
from high energy impacts upon atmospheric nitrogen and
oxygen nuclei. Share and Murphy [2001] also detected very
broad residual features which could not be so identiﬁed. The
strong line at 0.511 MeV due to the annihilation of positrons
from GCR-induced electromagnetic air showers was also de-
tected. Letaw et al. [1989] showed that the time-averaged
line strength measurements are in general agreement with
the values predicted by Ling [1976], and Share and Mur-
phy found agreement with the HEAO 3 measurements also
[Willett and Mahoney 1992].

Our purpose here is to follow up this work by measuring
the variation of the quiescent Earth atmosphere γ-ray ﬂux
with time and latitude. We will use as a surrogate spatial
variable the vertical geomagnetic cutoﬀ rigidity, and likewise
temporal variability will be expressed in terms of the phase
of the solar cycle.

2. Instrument, Observations and Analysis

2.1.

Instrument and Observations

The SMM orbit characteristics were: altitude ∼400–570
◦
km, inclination 28
, lifetime March 1980–December 1989. It
was pointed at the Sun for almost the whole of this time,
and therefore observed Earth for an extended period dur-
ing each ∼ 96-minute orbit. The Earth disk subtended a
◦
radius of about 70
at this altitude, which was essentially
contained within the GRS’s very large ﬁeld of view (FOV).
The accumulation of data was brieﬂy interrupted (Novem-
ber 1983 – April 1984) during preparations for repair of the
satellite’s attitude control. The instruments were turned
oﬀ during passages of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)
to avoid damage from high radiation doses from trapped
particles. Data taken within ∼ 104 s after SAA passages
were not used because of intense instrumental background
γ-radiation from short-lived radioactivities induced in the
SAA. The pattern of SAA passages was strongly inﬂuenced
by the precession period of the orbit, which was about 48 d.
The spectrometer itself consisted of seven 7.6 × 7.6 cm
NaI detectors surrounded to the sides and rear by anticoin-
cidence shielding [Forrest et al. 1980]. It was sensitive to
photon energies between 0.3–8.5 MeV, with FWHM resolu-
tion ∼ 6% at 1 MeV and binning into 476 energy channels.
The energy binning was kept consistent to very good accu-
racy throughout the mission by active gain control using an
on-board 60Co calibration source. The instrument response
as a function of energy and angle oﬀ-axis was calculated by
Monte Carlo simulations [S. Matz 1986, private communica-
tion].

The eﬀective area of the detector at 1 MeV was 120 cm2.
◦
The FOV (∼ 150
at 1 MeV, FWHM, as in Figure 1a was
large enough to contain Earth’s disk, as noted above. The
spectra were accumulated over 1 min intervals and labeled
according to ”Earth angle” (i.e. the angle between the Sun
pointing and the center of Earth) and geomagnetic cutoﬀ
rigidity. They were screened to exclude γ-ray bursts, solar
ﬂares and geomagnetic disturbances.

and ≤ 72

Despite the strength of the Earth atmosphere spectrum,
it was dominated in the 1-minute spectra by the background
spectrum arising from radioactivity in the GRS and space-
craft induced by energetic particle bombardment, mainly
in the SAA [Share et al. 1989]. This may be eliminated
by subtracting the count rates in spectra where the FOV
points away from Earth from those in spectra pointing to-
wards Earth; the spectra were selected to be within Earth
◦
angles 144
, within the same orbit, and at
similar values of cutoﬀ rigidity. The rear shielding of the
detector was not suﬃcient to block Earth radiation com-
pletely when pointing away from Earth, especially at high
energies, so that when the background subtraction was made
the Earth spectrum partially canceled. A correction factor
for this eﬀect, as a function of energy, was derived by J.
R. Letaw (unpublished report, 1988) from the Monte Carlo
simulations mentioned above, and was applied by us to the
background-subtracted spectrum (Figure 1b). Otherwise,
the background subtraction was very eﬀective, except for
two residual lines at the 60Co decay energies 1.17 and 1.33
MeV from the on-board source [Share and Murphy 2001].

After background subtraction the spectra were summed
over 3-day intervals. For studies of time and cutoﬀ rigid-
ity dependence the 3-day spectra were summed into several
combinations of time and rigidity bins. The basic unit for
temporal studies was 48 days, in order to average over any
eﬀects arising from background variability on the 48 day pre-
cession time-scale. In general the nuclear lines were found
to be too weak to be measured with good statistics in 48
days, so we performed a further summation over 6 months
for temporal studies. We also made summations over 9 years
(i.e. the whole mission) for analyses of cutoﬀ rigidity depen-
dence. The rigidity bins generally employed were <7, 7–11
and >11 GV at 48 d and 6 month resolutions, and <7, 7–9,
9–11, 11–13 and >13 GV over 9 years. There is some con-
tamination of each rigidity bin by its neighbors, due to the
GRS’s wide FOV, but this can be shown to be small, given
the inverse square law of ﬂux and the width of the bins.

A typical spectrum obtained in this way is shown in Fig-
ure 2, where the lines identiﬁed by Share and Murphy [2001]
are plotted individually. The unidentiﬁed very broad lines
detected by Share and Murphy [2001] are not plotted in Fig.
2.

A systematic uncertainty is expected in this analysis due
to γ-ray emission from astronomical sources, in particular
the Galactic center (GC). In December of each year Earth’s
orbital motion causes the apparent position of the Sun to
pass very close in angle to the GC, so that for some weeks
around this time the GC was almost in the center of the GRS
FOV, until the Sun’s motion (tracked by the GRS) carried
it out of the FOV. This emission was of course only visible
when the instrument pointed away from Earth; since these
spectra were subtracted from those pointing towards Earth
(see above), the peak in emission due to the GC’s transit
across the FOV ought to appear as a sharp dip in the inten-
sities of the components of our atmospheric spectra around
the Decembers of years 1980–1988 [Share et al. 1988]. In
practice we found that the dips were detected only in the
time series of the narrow 0.511 MeV line, the continuum,
and the broad residual features mentioned in §1, which are
so broad that they must be contaminated by the continuum.
Results for the 0.511 MeV line from the 6-month and 9-year
spectra contained unresolved dips, and were corrected by
subtracting the averaged GRS exposure to the dip ﬂux from
the GC as a function of time (Fig. 10 of Harris et al. [1990]).
The correction factors were small (∼ 3 − −5%).

On the shorter 48-day time-scale, the dips are resolved,
and are of interest in their own right, since it is possible that
an unknown terrestrial source might exist, which exhibits a
peak or trough every December. We distinguished between

celestial and terrestrial sources of the 0.511 MeV line by
looking at our ”Earth-viewing” and ”sky-viewing” spectra
separately on 48 day time-scales. These are both contam-
inated by lines from radioactive decay, but the 0.511 MeV
line from the GC is strong enough to appear in the ”sky-
viewing” data as positive annual peaks (instead of dips) due
to the GC transits (Fig. 9 of Share et al.
[1988]). The
”Earth-viewing” spectra should show no signal from the GC
(except for a small leakage through the rear of the detector),
responding only to terrestrial sources.

2.2. Analysis Procedure

We measured the strengths of the lines in spectra like
those of Fig. 2 using a model spectrum containing 24 lines
and the sum of two power-law continua between the ener-
gies 0.65–8.5 MeV. This was identical to the model used by
Share and Murphy [2001]. The lines were parametrized by
energy, width and amplitude; the broad residual features
mentioned in §1 were modeled by 5 broad lines; the con-
tinua were parametrized by power law index and amplitude.
The model spectra were convolved with the instrument re-
sponse, with the parameters being varied until the resulting
predicted count spectra agreed with the observed spectrum,
as speciﬁed by the minimum value of the χ2 function.1 The
model lines were assumed to be of Gaussian shape, and the
power laws were constrained so that one dominated the con-
tinuum at low energies and the other at high energies.

The positron annihilation line at 0.511 MeV is accompa-
nied by a strong continuum extending to lower energies, re-
sulting from energy losses by Compton scattering in Earth’s
atmosphere. We performed separate ﬁts to this feature, us-
ing a model consisting of a power law continuum between
0.35–0.62 MeV, a narrow line at 0.511 MeV, and a nearly
ﬂat continuum extending below 0.511 MeV to account for
the scattered component, as illustrated in Figure 3.

3. Results

All of the lines detected by Share and Murphy [2001] could
be detected in our spectra, though with lower signiﬁcance
due to the cuts we made into time periods and rigidity bins.
Both Willett and Mahoney [1992] and Share and Murphy
[2001] have made detailed comparisons between SMM and
HEAO 3 measurements. Here we present results for those
lines whose temporal or spatial behavior is expected to shed
light on physical processes in Earth’s atmosphere.

Modelling indicates that the nuclear lines are mainly due
to interactions with secondary neutrons produced by GCR
impacts, rather than to the GCR themselves [Ling 1975,
Masarik and Beer [1999]. We may distinguish between lines
produced by de-excitation of excited states of N and O
(which are excited by neutrons of ∼ 6–12 MeV), and those
produced by de-excitation of spallation products of N and
O nuclei, which require higher energies (the cross section
rises to a plateau above ∼ 20 MeV). The 4.44 MeV line is
the main example of a spallation-product de-excitation (Ra-
maty, Kozlovsky and Lingenfelter [1979] — it arises from
excited 11B or 12C, which are produced by spallation of 14N
and 16O). Most of the other lines result from a combination
of spallation and de-excitation processes, as discussed in de-
tail by Share and Murphy [2001]. However the two lines at
1.635 and 2.311 in Fig. 2 are predominantly the results of
de-excitation of 14N. It follows that the ratio of the inten-
sity of the 4.44 MeV to the intensities of the 1.635 and 2.311
MeV lines (combined) is a diagnostic of the relative impor-
tance of spallation and de-excitation reactions, and hence of
the ﬂuxes of secondary neutrons at high and low energies
respectively.

We therefore present our results for, and focus our Dis-
cussion on, the three nuclear lines mentioned above and the
0.511 MeV positron annihilation line. We discovered that,

as expected, they and the continuum varied at least qual-
itatively with the solar cycle, being strongest around solar
minimum (mid-1986). This is illustrated for the strongest
nuclear line in the spectrum, the 4.44 MeV line from de-
excitation of 12C and 11B, in Figure 4a. The phase of the
solar cycle is illustrated here by the atmospheric neutron
ﬂuxes measured at three stations in the global neutron mon-
itor system [Shea and Smart 2000] whose geomagnetic cutoﬀ
rigidities correspond approximately to our rigidity bins.2 We
quantify the overall solar-cycle variability as the diﬀerence
between the average line ﬂuxes during times of high activity
(years 1984 through 1988) and low activity (1980 through
1983, and 1989), which are presented in Table 1.

The ﬁgure and table also demonstrate that the 4.44 MeV
line intensity falls rapidly as cutoﬀ rigidity increases; again,
this is expected due to the shielding from charged particles
provided by Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The solar-cycle varia-
tion amplitude becomes weaker with increasing cutoﬀ rigid-
ity; this is consistent with scaling as the weakening of the
ﬂux itself, but in the highest rigidity range (> 11 GV) it is
also consistent with no variation.

The sum of the intensities of the 1.635 and 2.311 MeV
lines is shown as a function of time in Fig. 4b. It can be
seen that these lines also vary as expected with time (i.e.
solar cycle) and cutoﬀ rigidity, as shown quantitatively in
Table 1. The temporal behavior of the 0.511 MeV line is
also correlated with the solar cycle (Figure 5). In this time
series, which is at 48-day resolution, the dips around De-
cember due to subtraction of the annual transits of the GC
are clearly visible. The dips appear to be larger in the < 7
GV cutoﬀ rigidity data, a problem which will be addressed
in §4.3.2. The upper envelope of the time series, if the dips
are ignored, agrees qualitatively with the neutron monitor
solar cycle proxy. The Compton and power law continua
exhibited a second set of strong annual dips due to emission
from the Crab Nebula, peaking in June of each year, which
made it eﬀectively impossible to discern the shape of the
upper envelope of their time series.

To examine the rigidity dependence more fully, we give
our results in ﬁve rigidity bins from whole-mission spectra in
Table 2, for the nuclear lines at 1.635, 2.311 and 4.44 MeV
and for the 0.511 MeV annihilation line.

4. Discussion
4.1. The Behavior of the Lines from Spallation and
Direct De-excitation

As noted in §3, the ratio of the intensities of the lines
at 4.44 MeV and 1.635 plus 2.311 MeV is a function of the
relative importance of spallation reactions and nuclear de-
excitations caused by impacts of neutrons on atmospheric
nuclei. This in turn depends on the relative ﬂuxes of sec-
ondary neutrons below 12 MeV and above 50 MeV respec-
tively, due to the energy dependence of the cross sections,
which we consider below. In Figure 6, using the measure-
ments in Fig. 4, we plot the ratio between the strengths of
the 1.635 plus 2.311 MeV lines and the 4.44 MeV line from
1980 to 1989. It is found to be essentially constant at all
times and in all cutoﬀ rigidity bins — in the ﬁgure, vari-
ability of the points within each panel is not signiﬁcant, nor
are the diﬀerences between the long-term averages of each
panel. The same result is also obtained from the results in-
tegrated over 9 years for the ﬁner rigidity binning in Table 2
— the ﬂuxes in both categories of line fall as cutoﬀ rigidity
increases, approximately in lockstep at a rate ∼ 15% per
GV of rigidity.

We will compare these measured ratios of 1.635 plus 2.311
MeV to 4.44 MeV lines with theoretical predictions. We
generated the predictions from a neutron spectrum above

−2) at high
1 MeV at the top of the atmosphere (30 g cm
rigidity (15 GV) calculated by Kollar and Masarik [1999]
using Monte Carlo simulation. We approximated this neu-
tron spectrum by a broken power law
0.07E−1.29 neutrons/(cm2 s MeV)
for E ≤ 104 MeV
2.6 × 103E−2.31 neutrons/(cm2 s MeV) for E > 104 MeV

(1)

We used the standard reaction rate formula [Lang 1980] in
which this distribution is folded with the cross sections for
neutron inelastic scattering and spallation on 14N. These are
available below 20 MeV from Rogers et al. [1975] — above
20 MeV the inelastic cross sections go to zero and the spal-
lation cross section can be assumed to be constant at its
value 40 ± 8 mb at 20 MeV. The 20% uncertainty in the 14N
spallation cross section producing 4.44 MeV photons is the
major source of systematic error in this calculation. Taking
−0.06
it into account, we computed a predicted ratio of 0.36
+0.08 ,
in very good agreement with our measurement of 0.39 ± 0.03
at high rigidity > 11 GV (Table 1 and Fig. 6, right panel).
We now quantify the extent to which the shape of this
neutron spectrum is allowed to vary, given that our result is
consistent with a shape varying neither with time nor with
cutoﬀ rigidity (Fig. 6). For this purpose we take the low-
energy power law index in Eq. (1) as the parameter of inter-
est, since the high-energy power law contributes little. We
repeated our calculation of the (1.635 + 2.311 MeV)/4.44
MeV ratio with this index allowed to vary, for 14N spalla-
tion cross section values in the allowed range 32—48 mb.
The power law index was allowed to vary until the 3σ limits
on the variation of the line ratio from high to low phase of
the solar cycle were exceeded (i.e. 0.39 ± 0.09 at high cutoﬀ
rigidity > 11 GV). Figure 7 shows the results (left panel).
The dotted line represents the power law index which repro-
duces the mean line ratio 0.39 as a function of the spallation
cross section and the full lines are the 3σ limits. It is clear
that, while the absolute value of the power law index may
lie anywhere within the range ∼ −1.2— -1.45, for a given
14N spallation cross section it can only vary from the central
value by about 5% over time.

We next consider the allowable variation of the neutron
spectral shape with cutoﬀ rigidity. A further assumption
about the shape is necessary here, since predictions at cut-
oﬀ rigidities in the 5–11 GV range were not published by
Masarik and Beer [1999] and Kollar and Masarik [1999]; pre-
◦
dictions were published for high magnetic latitudes (> 70
and gave a neutron spectrum shape similar to that at the
equator. We therefore make the very simple assumption
that the neutron energy spectrum at any rigidity has the
same broken power law shape as in Eq. (1) such that the
amplitudes of the two terms are multiplied by a common
constant factor. The calculation of the predicted (1.635 +
2.311 MeV)/4.44 MeV line ratio as a function of the low-
energy power law index and the 14N spallation cross section
proceeded exactly as described above for the time variability
limits. Our limit for the allowed variability of this ratio as
a function of cutoﬀ rigidity was found from Table 2 to be
0.37 ± 0.03 (1 σ), or 0.37 ± 0.09 (3 σ). As would be expected
from the constancy of this ratio with both time and rigidity,
the resulting limits on the power law index are almost the
same for spatial as for temporal variability (Fig. 7 right):
the absolute value may lie between ∼ −1.15 — -1.45, but
for any given 14N spallation cross section it can only vary
by about ±6% between rigidities 5–15 GV.

In summary, despite the presence of a systematic uncer-
tainty in its value due to the experimental error in the nu-
clear cross sections, the variability of the neutron spectrum’s
low-energy power law index with time and cutoﬀ rigidity is
tightly constrained — whatever the actual value of the index
may be, the allowed changes during a solar cycle, and over
the range of cutoﬀ rigidities 5–15 GV, are ≤ 5%–6% (3σ).

4.2. Amplitude of solar-cycle modulation

It is quite clear from Figures 4a and 4b that in general the
nuclear γ-ray line ﬂuxes are more strongly modulated than

the count rates from ground-based neutron monitors which
were selected to have similar geomagnetic cutoﬀ rigidities.
This is shown quantitatively in Table 1 where we compare,
for both the γ-ray lines and the neutron monitors, the ﬂuxes
during low and high cosmic ray activity periods.

At ﬁrst sight this is unexpected, since the same incident
cosmic ray spectra are producing the neutrons which are
responsible for both measurements. There is, however, an
eﬀect predicted by theoretical simulations of the neutron
ﬂuxes in the atmosphere, as a function of depth, which can
explain this result. The key physical process is that that at
the top of the atmosphere neutrons are able to escape up-
wards, and this leakage probability depends on the cosmic
ray proton energy spectrum; lower energy protons are more
likely to generate upward-leaking neutrons. Spacecraft of
course see the eﬀects of both upward and downward moving
neutrons, whereas ground based measurements see only the
latter. The eﬀect is illustrated in Figure 8 (after Light et
al.
[1973]). Note that our results in §4.1 require that the
shape of the neutron spectrum is practically independent of
the hardness of the proton spectrum — it is the direction of
the neutrons (up or down) which is aﬀected. 3

A direct test of this solar modulation eﬀect cannot be
made, since no detailed simulations have been published
for the neutron spectrum as a function of solar cycle phase
and atmospheric depth. However simulations as a function
of cutoﬀ rigidity and depth were performed by Kollar and
Masarik [1999], and the eﬀect of high rigidity is qualitatively
similar to that of strong solar modulation, i.e. a harden-
ing of the incoming proton spectrum. In these simulations
the total neutron ﬂux falls oﬀ much faster between the top
and bottom of the atmosphere at low rigidities than at high
−2
rigidities. Thus the neutron ﬂux at a depth ∼ 20 g cm
(as seen from orbit) falls by a factor of 10 between cutoﬀ
rigidities 0.2 GV and 15 GV, while the neutron ﬂux at the
mountain-top level of the neutron monitors falls only by a
factor 2. The harder proton energy spectrum at 15 GV pro-
duces neutrons less likely to escape, and therefore relatively
more likely to reach 1000–3000 m.

This eﬀect must also occur when changes in the proton en-
ergy spectrum arise from the solar cycle modulation rather
than from varying geomagnetic cutoﬀ rigidity. Thus the
reduced amplitude of the modulation of the neutron mon-
itor count rates relative to our line ﬂux measurements is
due to the softer cosmic ray spectrum around solar mini-
mum giving rise to relatively enhanced leakage of neutrons
which are visible to spacecraft but not to ground-based in-
struments. The softening of the spectrum is however much
less pronounced between the extremes of a solar cycle than
between cutoﬀ rigidities 0.2–15 GV, so that the diﬀerences
up to ∼ 8% between the modulations at the top and bottom
of the atmosphere (Table 1) due to the solar cycle are much
less than the factor of 5 which the models predict to result
from varying geomagnetic cutoﬀ rigidity.

4.3. The 0.511 MeV electron-positron annihilation
line

4.3.1. Comparison with the nuclear de-excitation

and spallation lines

The atmospheric 0.511 MeV positron annihilation line
owes its existence to pair production from the energetic
photons generated in the electromagnetic component of air
showers produced by very energetic GCR, not to secondary
neutrons. Although its intensity falls oﬀ with increasing cut-
oﬀ rigidity R, Figure 9 (based on Table 2) clearly show that
it falls less rapidly than the intensity of the 4.44 MeV line.

The 4.44 MeV and other nuclear lines fall by factors of al-
most 4 when cutoﬀ rigidity increases from < 7 GV to > 13
GV, while the 0.511 MeV line falls oﬀ only by a factor ∼ 2.
Some insight into the energy dependence of these primary
processes can be gained by comparing the dependence on R
of the lines with the rate of fall-oﬀ of the downward cosmic
ray proton ﬂux with R, which was measured by the Alpha
Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment [Alcaraz et al.
2000] and is also plotted in Fig. 9. The AMS measurements
covered proton energies Ep in the range 70 MeV–200 GeV.
It is seen that the 4.44 MeV line ﬂux falls oﬀ approximately
in step with the cosmic ray proton ﬂux, whereas the 0.511
MeV line quite clearly falls less steeply with increasing R.
The behavior of the 4.44 MeV line implies that the mul-
tiplicity of the secondary neutrons which generate the 4.44
MeV line is not a strong function of Ep.4 Model calculations
of neutron production by nuclear evaporation predict a neu-
tron multiplicity ∼ E0.2
for N and O [Konecn´a, Valenta and
Smutn´y 2000], conﬁrming that it is indeed a weak function
of proton energy.

p

A second implication of the curves in Fig. 9 is that, con-
versely, the air shower process which generates positrons
and then 0.511 MeV photons is a strong function of energy
— the decreasing number of cosmic ray protons as R in-
creases must be partly oﬀset by the fact that the remaining
protons are more energetic and more eﬃcient at produc-
ing positrons. The electromagnetic cascade is produced by
the ”soft” component of a charged particle induced shower.
Charged particle strong interactions produce a shower of
pions which may undergo further strong interactions (pro-
ducing the ”hard” component of the air shower), or decay
into energetic γ-rays or leptons; electron-positron pair pro-
duction by electromagnetic interactions of these particles is
well understood [Lang 1980]. The multiplicity of secondary
pions at these energies is a rather weak function of energy,
varying as E0.3
p : [Wigmans 2002]), but the cross section for
pair production increases rapidly, as ∼ln3(Ep), conﬁrming
our expectation. The relative R-dependences of the 4.44
and 0.511 MeV lines in Fig. 9 are therefore qualitatively
explained by the Ep-dependences of the multiplicities with
which secondary particles (neutrons or pions) are produced,
and of the cross sections of the reactions which follow.

4.3.2. Anomalous
Galactic 0.511 MeV line

The annual dips in the time series of 0.511 MeV line
ﬂuxes, which are clearly visible in Fig. 5, are apparently de-
pendent upon R: the dips in the bin < 7 GV cutoﬀ rigidity
are about twice as deep as those in the other bins. This is not
expected from the theory of GC transits developed by Share
et al.
[1988] since (given the constant GC source) the dip
amplitude depends only on the occultation geometry, which
is not expected to vary signiﬁcantly with rigidity. There
are three possible causes: selection eﬀects in the transit ge-
ometry at low rigidity, the transiting of a second, unknown
cosmic 0.511 MeV line source across the GRS FOV, or an
unexpected eﬀect intrinsic to the LEO environment which
happens to cause a drop in the atmospheric 0.511 MeV line
ﬂux every December.

We tested for the presence of a cosmic or terrestrial source
of the dips by dividing our spectra into ”Earth-viewing” and
”sky-viewing” periods as described in §2.1; the dips in a time
series of ”Earth-viewing minus sky-viewing” 0.511 MeV am-
plitudes should appear as peaks in the ”sky-viewing” sub-
set, and not at all in the ”Earth-viewing” subset. The R
dependence of the dips in Fig. 5 might be caused by a
rigidity dependence of the ”sky-viewing” peaks (as in the
ﬁrst two hypotheses above) or by rigidity-dependent dips
in the ”Earth-viewing” subset (as in the third hypothesis).
We ﬁtted 48-day accumulated spectra of each type between
0.35–0.75 MeV (sub-divided into subsets with R > 11 and
R < 11) with a model spectrum containing four known

lines from spacecraft radioactvity and the 0.511 MeV, plus
a power law continuum (there is a full description in Share
et al. [1988]). The resulting amplitudes for the 0.511 MeV
line are shown in Figures 10a and 10b. It is clear that the
annual ”sky-viewing” peaks are not signiﬁcantly dependent
upon R. The ”Earth-viewing” spectra, by contrast, show
dips which are much stronger at low rigidity. However, the
relation between these dips and December of the calendar is
not very strong.

This analysis shows that the eﬀect is terrestrial in origin.5
The apparent strengthening of the GC-induced dips in De-
cember in Fig. 5 appears to be a chance occurrence of a
small number of R-dependent dips at that time of year (Fig.
10b).

There is no immediately obvious candidate for an eﬀect
intrinsic to Earth’s atmosphere which is restricted to low
geomagnetic cutoﬀ rigidities and operates sporadically on a
48-day time-scale. The dips do not appear to be more fre-
quent at any phase of the solar cycle, or to correlate with
geomagnetic events. Equally, an artefact of unknown origin
in the instrument or in our analysis may be responsible.

4.3.3. Comparison with HEAO 3 results
The 0.511 MeV annihilation line was strong enough for
the HEAO 3 count rates at this energy to be broken down
into bins of geomagnetic cutoﬀ rigidity, much as we have
done (§2.1). We compare our result (Table 2) with that of
Mahoney, Ling and Jacobson [1981] in Fig. 9 (open versus
closed circles). The HEAO 3 ﬂux values per steradian have
◦
been integrated over the SMM exposure to the 68
Earth
disk. This integration was also weighted by the limb dark-
ening function which Mahoney, Ling and Jacobson [1981]
measured using HEAO 3’s superior spatial resolution, which
is proportional to 1 + 1.7 cosθ where θ is the satellite zenith
angle seen from a disk point. The HEAO 3 measurements
then agree well with the SMM values, though having a rather
shallower decrease with cutoﬀ rigidity. They are consistent
with our ﬁnding that the 0.511 MeV line falls oﬀ more slowly
with rigidity than the 4.44 MeV line, and with our expla-
nation in terms of the interaction cross sections involved
(§4.2).

4.4. Broad residual lines at 1–5 MeV

We noted in Fig. 2 that, in addition to the narrow lines
shown there, ﬁve broad lines were necessary to ﬁt the spec-
trum [Share and Murphy 2001]. The actual residual fea-
tures which are ﬁtted by these ﬁve lines are shown in Figure
11. The peak around 5 MeV suggested to Share and Mur-
phy [2001] that thermal or epithermal neutron capture on
the 127I in the NaI and CsI detectors was responsible. We
repeated their comparison between the I thermal neutron
γ-ray spectrum and the residual features using an updated
database of I lines. Figure 11 shows that the agreement is
worse than that found by Share and Murphy [2001], although
the discrepancy at energies < 1 MeV when normalized to the
5 MeV feature is only a factor ∼ 2.

Our result in Fig. 11 suggests that the residual feature
in the 1–3 MeV range is due mainly to a diﬀerent process
from the instrumental neutron captures which generate the
∼ 5 MeV peak. We propose that there are atmospheric nu-
clear lines in this range which are not resolved by the GRS.
Additional evidence for this comes from the dependences of
the strengths of the 1–3 and 5 MeV residual features on ge-
omagnetic cutoﬀ rigidity in the range R ≤ 13 GV (Figure
12). In §4.1 we noted that atmospheric nuclear lines in gen-
eral decrease at approximately the same rate when rigidity
increases — the characteristic behavior, taking the 4.44 line
as typical, is a decrease in strength by about 15% per GV
(Table 2). The broad 1–3 MeV residual feature shares this
behavior: the ratio between this feature and the 4.44 MeV
line is plotted in Figure 12 and seen to be approximately

X - 6

HARRIS ET AL.: SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF EARTH ALBEDO γ-RAYS

constant below 13 GV — there is clearly some other process
at work above 13 GV (see below). The constancy below 13
GV is consistent with the feature being composed of unre-
solved atmospheric lines from nuclear spallation reactions
or nuclear de-excitation (the underlying reason being the
constancy of the secondary neutron spectrum, §4.1).

Compared with the 15% per GV rigidity fall-oﬀ rate of
both the atmospheric nuclear lines and the 1–3 MeV feature,
the 5 MeV residual feature in Fig. 12 falls oﬀ much faster for
R ≤ 13 GV. This is expected if it arises from thermal or ep-
ithermal neutron captures in orbit, i.e. the upward leakage
neutrons whose behavior was discussed in §4.2. In our com-
parison of neutron monitor and satellite data we found that
as R increases the primary GCR proton spectrum becomes
much harder, whereas upward-leaking neutrons are more ef-
ﬁciently produced by low energy protons (Fig. 8). Just as
relatively more neutrons reach ground-based neutron mon-
itors at high R, relatively fewer neutrons will reach LEO
— i.e.
the ratio between LEO neutrons and atmospheric
neutrons gets smaller as rigidity increases, as does the ratio
between the 1–3 MeV and ∼ 5 MeV features in Fig. 12
below 13 GV.

It is clear from Fig. 12 that at the highest rigidities
R > 13 GV (close to the geomagnetic equator) there is a
diﬀerent process acting. The 5 MeV residual feature rises
sharply, and the 1–3 MeV residual feature shows a less
marked increase, relative to the 4.4 MeV line. We suggest
that these increases result from the same epithermal neu-
tron captures on I, but that there is a distinct equatorial
population of neutrons over and above the up-going neu-
trons produced directly by GCR (whose abundance is low-
est at the equator). One possible source of such neutrons is
the LAP (low altitude particles) detected at energies above
500 keV by Hovestadt et al. [1972] at low geomagnetic lat-
itudes. These ions are ultimately derived from the equato-
rial ring current, but extend much lower in altitude (down
to < 100 km). Their abundance depends only weakly on
solar activity [Mazur, Mason and Greenspan 1998]. Their
energy spectrum extends at least up to 35 MeV [Gusev et
al. 1996], well above the ∼ 6 MeV thresholds of the reac-
tions 14N(p,n)14O and 14N(α,n)17F. Neutrons produced in
this way would have low (epithermal) energies, as required
for the 5 MeV residual feature, making a small contribution
to the 1–3 MeV feature also (Fig. 11, dashed line). A weak
point of this hypothesis is that the spectrum measured by
Mizera and Blake [1973] and Gusev et al. [1996] is very soft
(varying as energy E−4.4 if a power law), so that relatively
few ions exceed the reaction thresholds.

[1979]; protons — Eﬁmov et al.

Alternatively, albedo charged particles (electrons —
Basilova et al.
[1985],
referred to by Alcaraz et al.
[2000] as the ”second spec-
trum”) are known to rise in numbers near the geomagnetic
equator. Unlike the albedo neutron population, their ﬂuxes
are not related in a simple way to the primary GCR ﬂuxes,
due to their very complex trajectories in the geomagnetic
ﬁeld. Like the neutrons, they are thought to originate in
GCR impacts on atmospheric nuclei. The albedo protons
have moderately hard spectra extending up to a few GeV
and thus occur above the threshold energy for neutron pro-
duction. A drawback to this model is the uncertainty in
the propagation of the particles in the magnetic ﬁeld, which
was derived by Alcaraz et al. [2000] from Monte Carlo sim-
ulations rather than observation. The simulations suggest
that only a subset of albedo protons — those whose trajec-
tories involve many mirrorings over a relatively long lifetime
(”quasi-trapped”) — are equatorially concentrated, and it
is suggested that their origin is associated with the ener-
getic trapped SAA particles. The ﬂux is not expected to be
isotropic, having a strong east-west gradient, which makes
the directionality of any resultant neutrons, and SMM ’s re-
sponse to them, very diﬃcult to predict. The properties of
these particles are reviewed by Huang [2001].

5. Summary

We suggest four conclusions as to the behavior of the at-

mospheric γ-ray lines which we have studied here.
(1) The temporal behavior of all lines can be explained by
the varying modulation of the incident GCR ﬂux during the
solar cycle.
(2) The lines produced by two processes arising from sec-
ondary neutrons (spallation and de-excitation of air nuclei)
behave similarly with respect to geomagnetic location (i.e.
cutoﬀ rigidity).
(3) It follows from this that the shape of secondary neutron
energy spectrum is not strongly variable over the solar cy-
cle or over the limited range of cutoﬀ rigidities sampled by
SMM. If we assume a simpliﬁed broken power-law spectrum
of secondary neutrons, then the low energy power law index
must lie in the approximate range -1.15 – -1.45. There is
a systematic error in the absolute value, but the variabil-
ity in that absolute value over a solar cycle must be < 5%;
the spatial variability over the cutoﬀ rigidity range 5–15 GV
must likewise be < 6% (both 3σ upper limits).
(4) The behaviors of these neutron-induced lines and of the
0.511 MeV positron annihilation line with respect to cutoﬀ
rigidity are diﬀerent, and the diﬀerence can be explained by
the rigidity dependence of the measured GCR proton ﬂux
and by the cross sections for the elementary particle inter-
actions which produce them (respectively, secondary neu-
tron production, and electromagnetic cascades from ener-
getic secondary pions).

We ﬁnd that the signal from the known Galactic 0.511
MeV line (superposed on that from Earth’s atmosphere)
unexpectedly shows a dependence on cutoﬀ rigidity (§4.3.2),
which appears to be due to the infrequent chance occurrence
of unexplained short decreases in the Earth-atmosphere
0.511 MeV line signal at higher latitudes.

The origins of two very broad residual features in the
spectrum (∼ 1–3 MeV and 5 MeV, which we modeled by
ﬁve broad Gaussian lines) appear to be complex. We tenta-
tively suggest that most of the 1–3 MeV feature comes from
the contribution of many weak unresolved atmospheric lines,
while the rest of the 1–3 MeV feature and the whole of the
5 MeV feature are due to the capture of ambient thermal or
epithermal neutrons in the iodine in the GRS detectors. If
true, this requires the existence of two distinct populations
of neutrons in LEO, one of which follows the cutoﬀ rigidity
law described above (second and third conclusions) while
the other is conﬁned to low geomagnetic latitudes.

Notes

1. For ﬁts using such a large number of parameters the minima of
the χ2 function may be shallow and ambiguous. Our method
of mapping the function around the minimum is described by
Share and Murphy [2001]. In addition to the usual assignment
of errors by the criterion of the minimum χ2 + 1, in some ﬁts
systematic errors had to be included to take into account the
existence of more than one possible minimum.

2. The data were obtained from the archive at

http://www.env.sci.ibaraki.ac.jp/ftp/pub/WDCCR/STATIONS/.
The stations were selected to have comparable altitudes, high
count rates [Moraal et al. 2000], and to have been operating
during 1980–1989. They are Alma Ata B, Kazakh SSR (rigid-
ity 6.6 GV, altitude 3340 m), Tsumeb, Namibia (rigidity 9.2
GV, altitude 1240 m), and Huancayo, Peru (rigidity 13 GV,
altitude 3400 m).

3. This is illustrated in Fig. 8, where changes in the proton
energy have a very similar eﬀect on neutrons both above and
below 10 MeV, (i.e. those causing both de-excitation lines and
spallation lines). This is consistent with the leakage neutron
spectrum remaining approximately unchanged even when the
incident proton spectrum changes substantially, as required by
our results in §4.1.

4. As noted in §4.1, models suggest that the shape of the sec-
ondary neutron spectrum is much less variable with cutoﬀ
rigidity than the cosmic ray proton spectrum [Kollar and
Masarik 1999]. The R-dependence of the 4.44 MeV line might
nevertheless diﬀer from that of the proton ﬂux if the multiplic-
ity of neutrons produced per proton is a strong function of Ep.
The similarity between the curves for cosmic ray protons and
the 4.44 MeV line in Fig. 9 suggests that this is not the case.
5. We conﬁrmed that the source is not celestial by calculating
the exposures of the GRS to the GC and other possible cosmic
sources when in the R < 7 and R > 11 GV portions of the
orbit (cf. Share et al. [1988], Harris et al. [1990]). We found
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

20 MeV is shown (abscissa). Left panel — variability in
time allowed by the SMM measurement of the line ratio
at rigidities > 11 GV 0.39 ± 0.03 (see Fig. 6 right panel).
Right panel — variability with cutoﬀ rigidity allowed by
the SMM measurement 0.37 ± 0.03 (from range of mean
values of all three panels in Fig. 6). In both panels the
dotted line is the power law index which reproduces the
measured line ratio for a given 14N + p cross section and

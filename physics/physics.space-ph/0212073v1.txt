ABSTRACT

In this communication, we examine in situ observations of the magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of Phobos on
the Phobos-2 mission and give some analysis of the data during a unique experiment “Celestial Mechanics,”
which leads to the support of evidence of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld. In particular, it is suggested that the
peculiarity of the solar wind interaction with Phobos and rotating direction of the magnetic ﬁeld obtained on
the circular orbits around Mars are the evidence for the existence of an intrinsic planetary ﬁeld of Phobos.

INTRODUCTION

The principal objective of the Phobos mission was to investigate Phobos, its substance, and the solar wind
interaction with Phobos. With this aim the project had an experiment “Celestial Mechanics” (Kolyuka
et al., 1991). Unfortunately, the spacecrafts were lost. However, Phobos 2 spacecraft was lost when it was
in the vicinity of Phobos. Therefore, some part of the experiment was carried out in the Phobos vicinity
but the data obtained were not studied, moreover, most of the data are unpublished. In the present paper,
we study the measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of Phobos. The disturbances was observed
on the circular orbits near Phobos at distances of 180–250 km from its center when Phobos was in a solar
wind. During these events, a sharp rise in the regular part of the magnetic ﬁeld was observed. Analyzing the
interaction of the obstacle with the solar wind plasma, Mordovskaya et al. (2001) came to the conclusion,
that Phobos has its own magnetic ﬁeld. Using the equation of pressure balance for the solar wind and the
magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos at the magnetopause, in the dipole approximation the estimate of the magnetic
moment of Phobos M ′ was obtained, M ′ ≃ 1015 A·m2.

According to the measurements performed in the solar wind, the projection of the Phobos magnetic
moment onto the Mars ecliptic plane points in the direction of the trailing side of Phobos, i.e., to the
opposite direction of its motion along the orbit around Mars. Phobos represents itself as a magnetized
body. Phobos rotates around Mars, turning to it by the same side. It always presents the same face to
a hypothetical observer on Mars. This peculiarity of the rotation of the magnetized Phobos results in the
magnetic ﬁeld signatures, which, speciﬁcally the direction, are phase locked with Phobos rotation rate. The
direction of the magnetic ﬁeld observed should correspond to the direction given by the rotation. To resolve
this issue completely, in situ measurements in the Phobos vicinity are required. Unambiguous evidence of
the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld will only be obtained from the direct observations. This problem will be explored
in the present paper.

THE NAVIGATION ASPECTS OF THE PHOBOS MISSION

The Phobos space project had a very complicated scheme of ﬂight relative to Phobos and the organization
of a unique experiment named “Celestial Mechanics.” A description of the spacecraft ﬂight proﬁle is given
by Kolyuka et al. (1991). The spacecraft was transferred onto such an orbit around Mars on March 22, 1989
and it remained permanently within a vicinity of Phobos until March 27. The semi-major axis and plane of
the spacecraft orbit coincided with those of Phobos and there is a small diﬀerence in the orbital eccentricities.

Then, the motion of the spacecraft relative to Phobos takes the form of ellipses around Phobos, hence, the
name quasi-synchronous orbit.
Depending on the position of the spacecraft relative
to Phobos, the spacecraft either increases or reduces
the orbital velocity but does not move far away. This
circumstance will be important in our analysis. Fig-
ure 1 shows the trajectory projection of the relative
motion of Phobos 2 (S/C, the dashed line) and Phobos
(the solid line) onto the Mars equatorial plane (XOY ).
The X-axis points to the Sun; the X-Y plane coin-
cides with the orbital plane of Mars; the Y -axis points
in opposite direction of the Mars’s orbital velocity; the
Z-axis is perpendicular to X and Y . Thereby deﬁned
coordinate system will be used in the following. The
darkened region is the Mars wake. The dashed line
denotes the S/C orbit marked by the S/C image. The
solid line is the Phobos orbit marked by the Phobos
image with its magnetic moment and ﬁeld. The pa-
rameters S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8 character-
ize the diﬀerent situations and distances between the
spacecraft and Phobos on these orbits. At the posi-
tions S1 and S5, the S/C and Phobos are 180–200 km
apart and located on the straight line Mars–Sun. At
the positions S2, S4, S6, and S8 the distances between
them are 200–300 km. At the positions S3 and S7 they
are 300–400 km apart.

ﬁeld with its rotation around Mars are presented in

THE MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS NEAR PHOBOS
ON THE QUASI-SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT

Onboard the spacecraft, the two three-axes ﬂuxgate sensors of the FGMM and MAGMA instruments
carried out the magnetic ﬁeld measurements. A detailed description of the magnetometers and the ﬁrst
results can be found in (Auster et al. (1990), Aydogar et al. (1989), M¨ohlmann et al. (1990), Riedler et
al. (1989)). We will examine 45-s resolution magnetic ﬁeld measurements on circular orbits from March 22
until March 26, 1989 to present the experimental evidences of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld.

The Solar Wind Interaction with Phobos

The main argument of the evidence of an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos is peculiarities of the solar wind
interaction with Phobos. First, the eﬀective scale of the Phobos obstacle for the solar wind was observed.
Phobos, due to its intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld forms a large obstacle, which makes the solar wind be shielded
from the surface, leading a region of about 170 km from dayside surface (the sizes of Phobos are 18 × 21 × 27
km). Second, the subsolar stand-oﬀ distance of the deﬂection depends on the solar wind parameters. The
morphology of magnetic ﬁeld signatures due to the interaction of the Phobos with the solar wind plasma
during the time interval of March 22–26, 1989 was studied by Mordovskaya et al. (2002). Here we consider
the evidence of the existence of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld using data obtained from 18:00 to 20:00 on 24
March, 1989 when we can see the pure planetary magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld signature is displayed
during this encounter with a planetary magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos in Fig. 2a. In the middle pannel of the
Fig. 2 the plasma parameters are given. During this period when the spacecraft approached to Phobos at a
distance of 170–180 km from its dayside the magnetic ﬁeld signature has a sharp rise with a characteristic
“shock-like” behavior, which is marked by the arrows. The velocity V and density n obtained demonstrate
a lack of the solar wind plasma. This fact gives a strong argument in favour of the existence of the Phobos
magnetic ﬁeld and its magnetosphere.

the satellite (S/C) trajectory are given in the Phobos centric coordinate system for 18:00–20:00 on 24 March, 1989.

The value of the magnetic moment M ′, which has been calculated with the use of the equation of pressure

balance for the solar wind and dipole ﬁeld of the planet on the magnetopause, is M ′ ≃ 1015 A·m2.

The Phobos-2 encounter with a planetary magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos described by help of magnetic ﬁeld
lines is shown in Fig. 2c). The amplitudes, the direction of vectors of the magnetic ﬁeld Bx/By, and the
satellite trajectory (S/C) are given in the Phobos centric coordinate system. The ﬁeld observed along the
trajectory at 45-s intervals is represented by a scaled vector projection of B originating from the position
of the spacecraft at the corresponding times. Analyzing the magnetic ﬁeld direction near Phobos we can
determine with a great precision the boundary between completely open ﬁeld lines of the solar wind and
those with at least one end in Phobos. A dramatic change in ﬁeld line topology from 18:43 to 19:41 on
March 24, 1989 is an evidence indicating a transition from ﬁeld lines with no connection to Phobos to ﬁeld
lines with at least one end in Phobos.

The Corotating Part in the Measured Magnetic Fields

Other evidence for an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld is the existence of the corotating part in the measured
magnetic ﬁelds near Phobos. To demonstrate the rotation of the direction of the magnetic ﬁelds we will
employ the method describing the magnetic events with help of the magnetic force lines.

According to the peculiarity of the rotation of Phobos around Mars, the magnetic moment is directed in
opposite sides in the Mars wake and solar wind. Figure 1 depicts the rotation of the magnetized Phobos
around Mars in the projection onto the Mars ecliptic plane. Comparing the data, which were obtained
and predicted from the peculiarity of the rotation of Phobos around Mars, it is necessary to remind the
spacecraft was located permanently in the vicinity of Phobos at this time and the magnetic ﬁeld data
obtained should indicate the rotation of the direction of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld. In addition, one should
take into consideration that, depending on mutual position of the S/C and Phobos, there exist diﬀerent
situations like S2, S4, S6, and S8. The magnetometers acquired the vector measurements of the Phobos
magnetic ﬁeld beginning at various part of the Phobos vicinity. There exist the following four situations:
the S/C moves from Phobos (S2); Phobos approaches the S/C (S4); Phobos moves from the S/C (S6); the
S/C approaches Phobos (S8).

Three typical examples of the data measured continuously are represented in Fig. 3. The ﬁeld observed
along the trajectory at 45-s intervals is represented by a scaled vector projection of B originating from
the position of the spacecraft at such times. In this view, the Mars shadow is marked by the dark line.
The spacecraft trajectory is marked by encounter times of year 1989, hour:minute day.month UT. The
corresponding locations of Phobos at these moments can be found in the scheme shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 3. Top parts show the orientation and the magnitude
of the magnetic ﬁeld projection onto the Mars ecliptic plane.
The magnitudes of the observed magnetic ﬁeld versus the time
are shown in the bottom parts. The expected directions of the
Phobos magnetic ﬁeld are depicted by the schematic sketch of
Phobos magnetosphere. a) The data from 20:00 on March 22,
1989 to 04:00 on March 23, 1989. b) The data from 17:45 to
22:45 on March 24, 1989. c) The data from 17:00 on March 25,
1989 to 00:45 on March 26, 1989.

The magnitude of the observed magnetic ﬁeld versus the
time is represented in the bottom panels of Fig. 3. The
velocity Vs and density ns of the solar wind are also given
(the units for velocity and density are km/s and cm−3,
respectively). To compare the model data with the mea-
surements, we have chosen the appropriate orientation of
the Phobos magnetic moment and depicted the schematic
models of Phobos magnetosphere in Fig. 3. The corre-
sponding positions of the spacecraft are indicated by the
dotted lines. The big grey arrows going from the schemes
indicate the corresponding place of the measurements. It
is easily seen that the directions of the model magnetic
ﬁeld coincide with that of the measured one. When com-
paring the ﬁelds, one should take into consideration that
there exist the diﬀerences between the measurements of
the magnetic ﬁeld of the Phobos vicinity in the Mars wake
and that in the solar wind.

5

Figure 3b shows a unique case, when the dynamic pressure of the solar wind seems dropped and the
manifestation of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld can be detected over the entire orbit. At least, the rotation of
the magnetic ﬁeld direction is clearly observed. This fact gives the additional evidence that the magnetic
ﬁeld observed during 18:43–19:41 on March 24, 1989 can be associated with an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld of
Phobos.

About the Measurements in the Martian Wake

It is more easy to distinguish the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld signature in the Martian wake rather than in the
solar wind. The Martian wake is the most appropriate region for testing the presence of the Phobos magnetic
ﬁeld and the most disputable one. The rotation of the ﬁeld direction in agreement with the manifestation
of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld in the Martian wake is demonstrated in Fig. 3.

To compare the magnetic signature obtained near corotating region of Phobos (Fig. 3) with one obtained
in the “pure” wake of Mars, in Fig. 4 we present the magnetic ﬁeld measurements, which were acquired by
the spacecraft when its orbit did not coincide with that of Phobos.

The orientation of the ﬁeld in the Martian wake is governed by the direction of the solar wind magnetic
ﬁeld (Russell et al., 1995). Figure 4a shows a typical example of the magnetic signatures when the magnetic
ﬁeld of the solar wind points away from the Sun. The data shown in Fig. 3 are entirely diﬀerent from that
in Fig. 4a. Another example illustrating the magnetic signatures, when the magnetic ﬁeld of the solar wind
points toward the Sun, is shown in Fig. 4b. The change in polarity of magnetic ﬁeld components in the
Martian wake can be similar in Fig. 3 and 4b. In Figure 3, however, in the vicinity of terminator the magnetic
ﬁeld features, which are caused by the corotating region near Phobos, and the absence of ﬁlamentation of
the magnetic ﬁeld are typical manifestations of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld in the Mars wake.

Under the favorable conditions depending on the relative position of Phobos and spacecraft, the manifes-
tation of the Phobos magnetic ﬁeld was observed and the expected directions of the magnetic ﬁeld is always
similar to those depicted in Fig. 3 when the spacecraft was in the vicinity of Phobos within the Mars wake.

Conclusion

The trajectory of Phobos-2 provided the collection of data in the regions that are relevant for the investi-
gation of Phobos vicinity and have not been explored before. In this study we considered the evidences of
the existence of Phobos magnetic ﬁeld from the Phobos-2 data acquired on 22–24 March, 1989. We could
directly probe regions to observe the pure planetary magnetic ﬁeld of Phobos during the closest approaches
of the spacecraft to the Phobos surface at the distance of 170–180 km.

Source with an equivalent magnetic moment ≃ 1015 A·m2 within Phobos leads to the development of
an obstacle for solar wind ﬂow around Phobos with the subsolar stand-oﬀ distance of the deﬂection about
16–17 Phobos radii. In the plane coinciding with the projection onto the ecliptic plane of Mars the magnetic
moment of Phobos points to the trailing side. In the projection onto the Z-axis of the coordinate system
used, the magnetic moment of Phobos points out in the negative direction of Z-axis. In the present paper,
the direction of the Phobos magnetic moment is determined at a qualitative level. To obtain its direction
more precisely, special care should be taken when calculating the orbits. The magnetization of the Phobos
substance is 0.15 CGS. It should be noted that there are some meteorites with a magnetization of 3 CGS
(Gus’kova, 1972).

Our results conﬁrm the existence of a corotating part of the measured magnetic ﬁelds. Such a rotation
of the magnetic ﬁeld direction near Phobos gives an additional evidence that an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld of
Phobos does exist.

In conclusion, it is necessary to point out that solving the problems mentioned in this paper, in the context

of the “Celestial Mechanics” experiment, is only at the very beginning.

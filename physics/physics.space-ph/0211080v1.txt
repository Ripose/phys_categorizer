ﬂuctuations of the solar wind bulk plasma parameters as seen by

The solar wind provides a natural laboratory for observations of MHD turbulence over extended
temporal scales. Here, we apply a model independent method of diﬀerencing and rescaling to
identify self-similarity in the Probability Density Functions (PDF) of ﬂuctuations in solar wind bulk
plasma parameters as seen by the WIND spacecraft. Whereas the ﬂuctuations of speed v and IMF
magnitude B are multi-fractal, we ﬁnd that the ﬂuctuations in the ion density ρ, energy densities
B2
are mono-scaling on the timescales up
to 26 hours. The single curve, which we ﬁnd to describe the ﬂuctuations PDF of all these quantities
up to this timescale, is non-Gaussian. We model this PDF with two approaches– Fokker-Planck,
for which we derive the transport coeﬃcients and associated Langevin equation, and the Castaing
distribution that arises from a model for the intermittent turbulent cascade.

INTRODUCTION

Statistical properties of velocity ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
recorded in wind tunnels and these obtained from solar
wind observations exhibit striking similarities [1, 2]. A
unifying feature found in these ﬂuctuations is statistical
intermittency deﬁned as the presence of large deviations
from the average value. Intermittency can be detected
and characterized by the Probability Density Function
(PDFs) of these ﬂuctuations. The PDFs, unlike power
spectra that do not reveal intermittency, show a clear de-
parture from the Normal distribution when we consider
the diﬀerence in velocity on small spatial scales [3, 4]
while large scale features appear to be uncorrelated and
converge toward a Gaussian distribution. These similar-
ities suggest a common origin of the ﬂuctuations in a
turbulent ﬂuid and the solar wind. The approach is then
to treat the solar wind as an active highly nonlinear sys-
tem with ﬂuctuations arising in situ in a manner similar
to that of hydrodynamic turbulence [5, 6, 7, 8].

Kolmogorov’s K41 turbulence theory was based on the
hypothesis that the energy is transferred in the spec-
tral domain at a constant rate through local interaction
within the inertial range. This energy cascade is self-
similar due to the lack of any characteristic spatial scale
within the inertial range itself. These assumptions led
Kolmogorov to his scaling law for the moments of veloc-
ity structure functions [4]: Sn
i ∝
(ǫℓ)n/3, where n is the n-th moment, ℓ is a spatial scale
and ǫ represents energy transfer rate. Experimental re-
sults do not conﬁrm this scaling, however, and modiﬁ-
cations to the theory include intermittency [9] by means
of a randomly varying energy transfer rate ǫ.
In this
context, empirical models have been widely used to ap-

proximate the shapes of ﬂuctuation PDFs of data from
wind tunnels [10] as well as the solar wind; see for ex-
ample [11, 12]. The picture of turbulence emerging from
these models is much more complex then has been sug-
gested by the original Kolmogorov theory. It requires a
multi-fractal phenomenology to be invoked as the self-
similarity of the cascade is broken by the introduction
of the intermittency. Recently, however, a new approach
has emerged where the intermittency in the PDF can be
accompanied by the statistical self-similarity of the ﬂuc-
tuations.
In [13] for example, a L´evy distribution was
successfully ﬁtted to the ﬂuctuation PDFs of the price
index over the entire range of data. Such a distribution
arises from the statistically self-similar L´evy process also
characterized by enhanced (when compared with a Gaus-
sian) probability of large events. Recently [14] reported
similar self-similarity derived from the scaling of the solar
wind Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) energy den-
sity ﬂuctuations calculated from the WIND spacecraft
dataset. Here, we apply a model-independent and generic
PDF rescaling technique to extract the scaling properties
of the solar wind ﬂuctuations directly from the data. The
aim is to determine a set of plasma parameters that ex-
hibit statistical self-similarity and to verify the nature
of the PDF for their ﬂuctuations. We consider the fol-
lowing bulk plasma parameters: magnetic ﬁeld magni-
tude B, velocity magnitude v, ion density ρ, kinetic and
magnetic energy density (ρv2 and B2) and Poynting ﬂux
approximated by vB2. Such an approximation of the
Poynting ﬂux assumes ideal MHD where E = v
B. We
ﬁnd that the PDFs of ﬂuctuations in ρ, B2, ρv2 and vB2
exhibit mono-scaling for up to 10 standard deviations,
while B and v are clearly multi-fractal as found previ-
ously [12, 15]. The mono-scaling allows us to derive a
Fokker-Planck equation that governs the dynamics of the
ﬂuctuations’ PDFs. The Fokker-Planck approach pro-
vides a point of contact between the statistical approach
and the dynamical features of the system. This allows us

quantities as well as to develop a diﬀusion model for the
shape of their PDFs. We also consider a Castaing model
where ﬂuctuations are assumed to arise from a varying
energy transfer rate ǫ in the nonlinear energy cascade,
with Gaussian distribution for ln(ǫ). The paper is struc-
tured as follows: in section II we will describe the dataset
used for this study as well as the rescaling procedure. In
section III the results of the rescaling will be presented.

Two possible models of the ﬂuctuations will be discussed
in Section IV. Finally in Section V we will summarize all

II. DATA AND METHODS

A. The Dataset

The solar wind is a supersonic, super-Alfv´enic ﬂow of
incompressible and inhomogeneous plasma. The WIND
spacecraft orbits the Earth-Sun L1 point providing a
set of in situ plasma parameters including magnetic
ﬁeld measurements from the MFI experiment [16] and
the plasma parameters from the SWE instrument [17].
The WIND solar wind magnetic ﬁeld and key parameter
database used here comprise over 1.5 million, 46 second
averaged samples from January 1995 to December 1998
inclusive. The selection criteria for solar wind data is
given by the component of the spacecraft position vector
along the Earth-Sun line, X > 0, and the vector magni-
tude, R > 30 RE. The data set includes intervals of both
slow and fast speed streams. Similar to other satellite
measurements, short gaps in the WIND data ﬁle were
present. To minimize the errors caused by such incom-
plete measurements we omitted any intervals where the
gap was larger than 2%. The original data were not av-
eraged nor detrended. The data are not sampled evenly
but there are two dominant sampling frequencies: 1/46
Hz and 1/92 Hz. We use sampling frequency fs of 1/46
as our base and treat other temporal resolutions as gaps
when the accuracy requires it (τ

92 seconds).

B. Diﬀerencing and Rescaling Technique

−

Let x(t) represent the time series of the studied sig-
nal, in our case magnetic ﬁeld magnitude B, velocity
magnitude v, ion density ρ, kinetic energy density ρv2,
magnetic ﬁeld energy density B2 or the Poynting ﬂux
component approximated by vB2. A set of time series
x(t) is obtained for each value of the
δx(t, τ ) = x(t + τ )
non-overlapping time lag τ . The PDF P (δx, τ ) is then
generated for each time series δx(t, τ ). Fig. 1 shows the
set of such raw PDFs of the density ﬂuctuations for time
9 days. A generic one pa-
lags between 46 seconds and
rameter rescaling method [14] is applied to these PDFs.
We extract the scaling index α, with respect to τ , directly
from the time series of the quantity δx. Practically, ob-
taining the scaling exponent relies on the detection of a
τ −α, for values of the raw PDF
power law, P (0, τ )
peaks and time lag τ . Fig. 2 shows the peaks P (0, τ ) of
the unscaled PDFs plotted versus τ on log-log axes for
the four bulk plasma parameters. We see that the peaks
of these PDFs are well described by a power law τ −α for
a range of τ up to
26 hours. We now take α to be the
scaling index and attempt to collapse all unscaled PDFs
P (δx, τ ) onto a single curve Ps(δxs) using the following

(1)

A self-similar Brownian walk with Gaussian PDFs on all
temporal scales and index α = 1/2 is a good example
of the process where such collapse can be observed (see
e.g.
[18]). For experimental data, an approximate col-
lapse of PDFs is an indicator of a dominant mono-fractal
trend in the time series, i.e., this method may not be
sensitive enough to detect multi-fractality that could be
present only during short time intervals. One can treat
the identiﬁcation of the scaling exponent α and, as we
will see, the non-Gaussian nature of the rescaled PDFs
(Ps) as a method for quantifying the intermittent char-
acter of the time series. Another possible interpretation
of the rescaling is to treat P (δx, τ ) as the self-similar
solution of the equation describing the PDF dynamics.
The mono-scaling of the ﬂuctuations PDF, together with
the ﬁnite value of the samples’ variance, indicates that a
Fokker-Planck approach can be used to express the dy-
namics of the unscaled PDF in time and with respect
to the coordinate δx [19]. In section 4 we will use the
Fokker-Planck equation to develop a dynamical model
for the ﬂuctuations observed in the solar wind.

Ideally, we use the peaks of the PDFs to obtain the
scaling exponent α, as the peaks are statistically the most
accurate parts of the distributions. In certain cases, how-
ever, the peaks may not be the optimal statistical mea-
sure for obtaining the scaling index. For example, the
Bz component of the solar wind magnetic ﬁeld is mea-
sured with an absolute accuracy of typically about 0.1
nT. Such discreteness in the time series introduces large
errors in the estimation of the peak values P (0, τ ) and
may not give a correct scaling. However, if the PDFs

rescale, we can in principle obtain the scaling exponent
from any point on the curve. We will illustrate this in
the next section where we obtain the rescaling index α
from two points on the curve P (0, τ ) and P (σ, τ ).

III. PDF RESCALING RESULTS

We are now ready to present results of the rescaling
procedure as applied to the solar wind bulk plasma pa-
rameters. Fig. 1 shows the unscaled (raw) PDF curves
of the ion density data. These PDFs, like all others pre-
sented in this section, were generated with the bin size
decreasing linearly toward the center of the distribution
to improve the accuracy of the PDF for small ﬂuctua-
tions. Although the entire range of data was used to

then shows P (0, τ ) plotted versus τ on log-log axes for
δx = δ(ρ), δ(ρv2), δ(B2) and δ(vB2). Straight lines on
such a plot suggest that the rescaling (1) holds at least for
the peaks of the distributions. In Fig. 2, lines were ﬁtted
with R2 goodness of ﬁt for the range of τ between 2 min-
utes and 26 hours, omitting points corresponding to the
ﬁrst two temporal scales as in these cases the sharp peaks
of the PDFs can not be well resolved. The lines suggest
26 hours.
self-similarity persists up to intervals of τ
The slopes of these lines yield the exponents α and these
are summarized in Table I along with the values obtained
from analogous plots of P (σ(τ ), τ ) versus τ which show
the same scale break and the same scaling exponent for
δ(ρ), δ(ρv2), δ(B2) and δ(vB2), to within the estimated
statistical error. Within this scaling range we now at-
tempt to collapse each corresponding unscaled PDF onto
a single master curve using the scaling (1). Figs. 3-6
show the result of the one parameter rescaling applied
to this unscaled PDF of ﬂuctuations in ρ, ρv2, B2 and
vB2 respectively, for temporal scales up to
26 hours.
We see that the rescaling procedure (1) using the value
of the exponent α of the peaks P (0, τ ) shown in Fig. 2,
gives good collapse of each curve onto a single common
functional form for the entire range of the data. These
rescaled PDFs are leptokurtic rather than Gaussian and
are thus strongly suggestive of an underlying nonlinear
process. All PDFs are symmetric with the exception of
the density ﬂuctuations which seem to have higher values
for the large positive values as compared to the negative
ones. It has been reported previously [10] that the PDFs
obtained from hydrodynamic turbulence have exponen-
tial tails. These look linear on the semi-log plots that are
commonly used here and elsewhere in the literature. In
the case of the solar wind bulk plasma parameters we do
not ﬁnd such clear exponential cutoﬀ region but rather

It has been found previously [15] that the magnetic
ﬁeld magnitude ﬂuctuations are not self-similar but
rather multi-fractal. For such processes the scaling de-
rived from P (0, τ ) would not be expected to rescale
the entire PDF. To verify this we applied the rescal-
ing procedure for magnetic ﬁeld magnitude diﬀerences
B(t). Fig. 8 shows the result of one
δB(t, τ ) = B(t + τ )
parameter rescaling applied to the PDFs of the magnetic
ﬁeld magnitude ﬂuctuations. We see that the scaling pro-
cedure is satisfactory only up to
3 standard deviations
of the original sample, despite the satisfactory scaling
obtained for the peaks P (0, τ ) of the PDFs (see insert
of the Fig. 8). This conﬁrms the results of [11] where a
two parameter Castaing ﬁt to values within 3 standard
deviations of the original sample yields scaling in one pa-
rameter and weak variation in the other. Attempts to
improve the collapse by using information in the tails
(values
> 3σ) would introduce a signiﬁcant error in
the estimation of the scaling exponent α. We found sim-
ilar lack of scaling in the ﬂuctuations of the solar wind
velocity magnitude and we show the rescaled PDF in
the Fig. 9. We stress that the log-log plots of the PDF
peaks P (0, τ ) show a linear region for both velocity and
magnetic ﬁeld magnitude ﬂuctuations (see insert in each
ﬁgure). Their PDFs, however, do not collapse onto a sin-
gle curve when the rescaling (1) is applied. This lack of
mono-scaling is evident when indices derived from P (0, τ )
and these found for P (σ, τ ) are compared (see Table I).

IV. MODELLING THE DATA

The rescaling technique applied in the previous section
indicates that, for certain temporal scales, the PDFs of
some bulk plasma parameters can be collapsed onto a sin-
gle master curve. The challenge now lays in developing
physical models that can describe the functional form of
this curve. Here we consider two approaches. The ﬁrst is
a statistical approach where we assume that the ﬂuctua-
tions can be described by a stochastic Langevin equation.
The second method is to assume the ﬂuctuations are the
result of the nonlinear energy cascade and derive the cor-
responding PDF form for the rescaled PDFs (Castaing
distribution) [10].

A. Diﬀusion model

The Fokker-Planck (F-P) equation provides an impor-
tant link between statistical studies and the dynamical
approach expressed by the Langevin equation [18].
In
the most general form F-P can be written as:

∂P
∂τ

=

∇δx(A(δx)P + B(δx)

∇δxP ),

(2)

≡

P (δx, τ ) is a PDF for the diﬀerenced quantity
where P
δx that varies with time τ , A(δx) is the friction coeﬃ-
cient and B(δx) is related to a diﬀusion coeﬃcient which
we allow to vary with δx. For certain choices of A(δx)
and B(δx), a class of self-similar solutions of (2) satis-
ﬁes the rescaling relation given by (1). This scaling is
a direct consequence of the fact that the F-P equation

is invariant under the transformation δx

We then attempt to ﬁt the predicted solution (5) to the
normalized rescaled PDFs. The results of such a ﬁt for
the ﬂuctuations of the kinetic energy density PDF is
shown in the Fig. 10 (solid line). This ﬁt is obtained
with the following parameters a0/b0 = 2.0, b0 = 10,
C = 0.00152, k0 = 0.0625 and α = 0.41 as derived
from the rescaling procedure. We note that the ﬁgure
is a semi-log plot and thus emphasizes the tails of the
distribution - for a diﬀerent value of the ratio a0/b0 the
ﬁt around the smallest ﬂuctuations could be improved.
Equation (5) can not, however, properly model the small-
est ﬂuctuations as it diverges for δxs →
form

Let us now assume that a Langevin equation in the

0.

d(δx)
dt

= β(δx) + γ(δx)ξ(t)

(7)

can describe the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations. In (7) the
random variable ξ(t) is assumed to be δ-correlated, i.e.,

< ξ(t)ξ(t + τ ) >= σ2δ(τ ).

(8)

This condition is fulﬁlled in the data analysis by forming
each time series δx(t, τ ) with non-overlapping time inter-
vals τ and was also veriﬁed by computing the autocorre-
lation function of the diﬀerenced time series. Introducing
0 1/γ(δx′)d(δx′), equation (7) can
a new variable z =
be written as:
R

One can immediately obtain a F-P equation that corre-
sponds to the Langevin equation (9) [19]. We can then
compare this F-P equation with that given by (3) to ex-
press coeﬃcients β(δx) and γ(δx) in terms of a0 and b0
(see Appendix B). Deﬁning D0 =< ξ2(t) > /2 we obtain:

Equation (7) together with deﬁnitions of its coeﬃcients
(10) and (11) constitutes a dynamical model for the ﬂuc-
tuations in the solar wind quantities. From (10) and
(11), we see that the diﬀusion of the PDF of ﬂuctuations
in the solar wind is of comparable strength to the ad-
2). We stress that the advection and
vection (a0/b0 ≈
diﬀusion processes that we discuss here are of the proba-
bility in parameter space for ﬂuctuations and do not refer
to the integrated quantities.

B. Castaing model

We now, for comparison, consider a model motivated
directly by a cascade in energy, due to Castaing. This em-
pirical model was developed for the spatial velocity ﬂuc-
tuations recorded from controlled experiments in wind
tunnels [10, 20] and has been applied to the solar wind
data [11, 12]. The underlying idea of this approach is
that, for constant energy transfer rate between spatial
scales, all quantities should exhibit a Gaussian distribu-
tion of ﬂuctuations. The intermittency is then introduced
to the PDF through the ﬂuctuations of the variance σ of
that Gaussian distribution. A log-normal distribution is
assumed for the variance σ:

d(ln(σ)),

(12)

where σ0 is the most probable variance of the ﬂuctuations
and λ is the variance of ln(σ). Combining these two hy-
pothesis Castaing proposed the following functional form

We can now compare the rescaled PDFs with both
F-P and Castaing predicted curves which are shown in
Fig. 10. We can see from the ﬁgure that both models
provide an adequate ﬁt to the δ(ρv2)s PDF, and hence
will also describe the PDF of other scaling bulk plasma
parameters. Both curves, however, fall signiﬁcantly be-
low observed PDF values for
2, although the
Castaing distribution ﬁts the peak of the PDF reason-
ably well (see insert in Fig. 10). This departure from the
experimental PDF, in the case of the Castaing distribu-
tion, may reﬂect the diﬀerence between hydrodynamics
and MHD turbulence.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper we have applied a generic PDF rescaling
method to ﬂuctuations of the solar wind bulk plasma pa-
rameters. We ﬁnd that, consistent with previous work,
magnetic ﬁeld and velocity magnitudes do not exhibit
mono-scaling whereas PDFs of ﬂuctuations in B2, ρ,
ρv2 and vB2 can be rescaled with just one parameter
for temporal scales up to
26 hours. All the investi-
∼
gated PDFs show intermittency on these temporal scales.
Consequently their PDFs are leptokurtic and show in-
creased probability of large ﬂuctuations compared to that
of the Normal distribution. Fluctuations on large tem-
poral scales, τ > 26 hours, seem to be uncorrelated and
their PDFs converge toward a Gaussian. The mono-
scaling of ﬂuctuations associated with energy densities
and Poynting ﬂux is intriguing and suggests a possible
simpliﬁcation over picture of intermittency in the energy
cascade. The fact that all quantities share the same PDF,
to within errors, is also strongly suggestive of a single un-
derlying process. This is also supported by the similar
values of the scaling exponents.

We then present a Fokker-Planck approach that allows
us to obtain a functional form of the rescaled PDFs and
obtain a Langevin equation for the dynamics of the ob-
served ﬂuctuations. The model shows that both advec-
tive and diﬀusive terms need to be invoked to describe
the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations. The calculated diﬀu-
(δxs)2−1/α. We
sion coeﬃcient is of the form D(xs)
obtained a good ﬁt of the model to our rescaled PDFs
over at least 10 standard deviations. We also examined
a Castaing model and found a set of ﬁt parameters for
which both Castaing distribution and our diﬀusion model
have nearly identical form. Since both the F-P model and
the Castaing distribution ﬁt our rescaled PDFs we con-
clude that their moments should exhibit same variation
with time lag τ .

APPENDIX A

Let P (δx, τ ) be a homogeneous function that satisﬁes
scaling (1). Our aim is to ﬁnd functional form of the coef-
ﬁcients A(δx) and B(δx) for which P (δx, τ ) is a solution
of a F-P equation (2). Using (1) we can now rewrite (2)
to read:

(A1)

If all terms in the rhs of (A1) are to contribute and for
P (δxs) to remain a function of δxs only we must have:

A(δx)
tα−1 = a(δxs) and

B(δx)
t2α−1 = b(δxs).
Both A(δx) and B(δx) must then be of form:
and B(δx) = b0(δx)ν ,

A(δx) = a0(δx)η

(A2)

(A3)

where a0 and b0 are constants. Changing variables to
the rescaled δxs and substituting (A3) into (A2) we ex-
press exponents η and ν in terms of the rescaling index
α derived from the data. We then obtain:

which allows to write the ﬁnal power law form of A(δx)
and B(δx):

A(δx) = a0(δx)1− 1

and B(δx) = b0(δx)2− 1

(A5)

Substituting these expressions into F-P equation (2) we
obtain (3) from Section 4. Using these results the term
dA(δx)
d(δx) on the rhs of (A1), for example, becomes:

APPENDIX B

Comparing (B5) with the F-P equation (3) we can iden-
tify:

Consider the following Langevin type of equation:

(B1)

D0γ2 = (δx)1− 1

(B6)

where the random variable ξ(t) is assumed to be δ-
correlated, i.e.,

and then we must demand that:

< ξ(t)ξ(t + τ ) >= σ2δ(τ ).

(B2)

Introducing a new variable z =

In summary we have shown that the F-P equation given
by (3) is equivalent to the stochastic Langevin equation
(7) where coeﬃcients β and γ are given by:

One can immediately obtain a F-P equation that corre-
sponds to the Langevin equation (B3) and reads:

where D0 = σ2/2. The probability is an invariant of the
variable change so that P (δx)d(δx) = P (z)dz and we can
then rewrite (B4) for P (δx, τ ):

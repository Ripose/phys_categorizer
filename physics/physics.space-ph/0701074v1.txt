ABSTRACT
In the near future there will be launched space missions (e.g. COROT, KEPLER),
designed to detect Earth-like extrasolar planets. The orbital elements of these (still
hypothetic) planets will contain some uncertainties, that can only be eliminated by
careful dynamical investigations of the hosting planetary systems. The proportion of
extrasolar planetary systems with one known giant planet is high (∼ 90%), therefore
as a ﬁrst step we have investigated the possible existence of terrestrial planets in these
systems. In this paper a development of a stability catalogue of the habitable zones
of exoplanetary systems is reported. This catalogue is formed by a series of stability
maps, which can help to establish, where Earth-like planets could exist in extrasolar
planetary systems having one giant planet. After a description of the dynamical model
and the numerical methods, details of the stability maps are discussed. An application
of the stability catalogue to 15 known exoplanetary systems is also shown, and a
characterization of the stability properties of their habitable zones is given.

Key words: astrobiology – celestial mechanics – methods: numerical – (stars:) plan-
etary systems.

INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery of the ﬁrst extrasolar planet around a
solar-type star, 51 Pegasi by Mayor & Queloz (1995), by
now (October 2006) 209 exoplanets have been found. These
planets form 179 exoplanetary systems, among which there
are 21 multiple systems. The main detection technique of ex-
oplanets is based on the Doppler shift of the hosting star’s
spectral lines. This method is adequate to discover giant
planets, but it is not yet capable to detect Earth-sized plan-
ets.

However, the detection and investigation of Earth-
like exoplanets can be of great importance for the fur-
ther improvements of formation theories of our Solar Sys-
tem, where both rocky Earth-like, and gaseous Jupiter-
like planets have been formed. Another major question
which has a special
interest not only for the scientiﬁc
community is whether life may have evolved in some ex-
oplanetary systems. The region of an exoplanetary sys-
tem, where water-based life might evolve,
is called the
habitable zone (HZ). Simply saying, the HZ of a plane-
tary system is that region, where liquid water can exist
on the surface of a planet (Kasting, Whitmire & Reynolds
1993). The dynamical stability of hypothetical Earth-like

planets in the HZs of several extrasolar planetary sys-
tems has been the subject of intensive research (see for in-
stance Jones, Sleep & Chambers 2001; Menou & Tabachnik
2003; Asghari et al. 2004; Jones, Underwood & Sleep 2005;
Jones, Sleep & Underwood 2006). According to these stud-
ies many systems can host terrestrial exoplanets in their
HZs.

Recently, there have been much eﬀorts for the construc-
tion of space probes aiming at the detection of terrestrial ex-
oplanets in the near future. Such is COROT, to be launched
in November 2006, and KEPLER with a launch in 2008.
These missions will use transit photometry as detection tech-
nique. The transit of an unseen exoplanet in front of the
hosting star’s disc is expected to result in an observable dim-
ming of the star’s light intensity. There are also other plans,
such as NASA’s TPF and SIM, or ESA’s Darwin and Gaia
missions in the next decade aiming at studying all aspects
of exoplanets.

By using data obtained from the observations, the or-
bital parameters of an exoplanet can be derived only within
some error limits. In order to improve the orbital parame-
ters certain constraints should be used. For instance, if an
Earth-like planet were discovered in an extrasolar planetary
system, where an already detected giant planet is known to
orbit the star, such a constraint could be the dynamical sta-
bility of the terrestrial planet. This means, that those orbital

2

S´andor et al.

solutions for the terrestrial planet, which result in unstable
orbits, are unlikely and therefore should be excluded.

The dynamical stability of Earth-like planets can be es-
tablished in several ways, for example (i) by exploring the
stable and unstable regions of the phase space of each ex-
trasolar planetary system separately, or (ii) by using sta-
bility maps computed in advance for a large set of orbital
parameters. In this paper we present such stability maps
and show how to apply them to the detected exoplanetary
systems. The second method has the advantage that the
stability properties of a terrestrial planet can be easily es-
tablished when the orbital parameters of the giant planet
of an exoplanetary system are modiﬁed. Very often the or-
bital parameters of the giant planets are uncertain, and due
to the accumulation and improvements of the observational
data, they are changed quite frequently. If the ﬁrst approach
is chosen, one has to re-explore the phase space of the in-
dividual exoplanetary system after each modiﬁcation of the
orbital parameters of the giant planet. However, this is not
necessary when the second method is used, since the sta-
bility properties of the investigated planetary system can
be easily re-established from the already existing stability
maps.

As a ﬁrst step towards general stability maps, we com-
piled a stability catalogue for a dynamical model consisting
of a star, a giant planet, and a small Earth-like planet. We
present this catalogue in this paper. Section 2 describes the
dynamical model and the applied numerical methods. De-
tails of the catalogue and the stability maps are given in
Sections 3 and 4. Section 5 shows how to apply the cata-
logue to individual exoplanetary systems. By using this cat-
alogue, the dynamical reality of the orbital elements of a
newly discovered terrestrial planet in an extrasolar plane-
tary system can be easily determined. This catalogue can
also be used to establish the stability properties of the HZs
of known exoplanetary systems. This is shown in Section 6.

2 DYNAMICAL MODEL AND METHODS OF

INVESTIGATION

The majority of planetary systems, detected up to now, con-
sists of a star and a giant planet revolving about it in an ec-
centric orbit. Therefore we use a relatively simple dynamical
model (known as the elliptic restricted three-body problem),
where two massive bodies, called the primaries, move in el-
liptic orbits about their common center of mass, and a third
body of negligible mass moves under their gravitational in-
ﬂuence (for details see Szebehely 1967). In our application
the primaries are a star and a giant planet, and the third
body is a small Earth-like planet, regarded as massless.

We note, however, that among the extrasolar planetary
systems with long observational baselines, there is a high
rate of multiple planet systems. Thus a more convenient
model for our stability investigations would be the restricted
N -body problem with N − 2 giant planets (N > 4). The
presence of additional giant planets may enhance the insta-
bilities, induced by just one massive planet, and make the
HZ of a system more unstable. The instabilities may appear
due to mean motion resonances between the massive giant
planet and the Earth-like planet. Thus, by mapping these
resonances, we can ﬁnd the most signiﬁcant birthplaces of

instabilities in the habitable zones. On the other hand, the
dynamical model with one giant planet also oﬀers the most
convenient way to display the most important mean motion
resonances as a function of the mass ratio of the star and
the giant planet, and of the eccentricity of the giant planet.
In this paper we mapped these resonances, and the eﬀects
of additional giant planets will be studied in a future work.
To explore the stable and unstable regions of the mo-
tion of the third body, the equations of motion have to be
integrated for a large set of initial conditions and for a long
time for each orbit. This can be very time consuming, even
in the case of a huge computing potential. In order to study
eﬃciently the stability properties of dynamical systems, sev-
eral numerical techniques and chaos detection methods have
been developed recently. Using the working hypothesis, that
chaotic behaviour means instability through chaotic diﬀu-
sion of trajectories in the phase space, these methods can
be applied to explore the stable and unstable regions of
dynamical systems. We are, however, aware of the fact,
that chaotic behaviour does not necessarily mean instabil-
ity. There could be orbits exhibiting chaotic behaviour, but
stable in Nekhoroshev-sense, e.g. remaining in a bounded re-
gion of the phase space for time intervals equal to the age of
the investigated planetary system. However, if other desta-
bilizing eﬀects, such as the presence of yet undetected giant
planets are present in the exoplanetary systems, chaotic be-
haviour may result in really unstable orbits. In other words,
in high dimensional dynamical systems unstable orbits em-
anate only from the chaotic regions of the phase space. Ex-
ploring these regions we can ﬁnd the birth domains of unsta-
ble orbits. However, in order to decide the stability character
of an orbit, one has to use long-term numerical integration of
the equations of motion. On the other hand, in the case of a
large set of initial conditions the fast chaos detection meth-
ods allow us to explore qualitatively the dynamical structure
of the extrasolar planetary systems.

2002). We also applied the maximum eccentricity method
(MEM) (see for instance Dvorak et al. 2003), as an inde-
pendent check of the RLI and the FLI by direct numerical
integration of the equations of motion. The knowledge of
the eccentricity of stable orbits is essential for the problem
of the development of a biosphere on a terrestrial planet in
the habitable zone of a star. For example, recent estimations
for the maximum eccentricity for the Earth – after detailed
atmosphere models1 – are emax < 0.2.

Regarding the RLI and the FLI, our choice is motivated
by the complementary character of the two chaos detection
methods. The RLI measures the diﬀerence between the con-
vergence of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov indicators to the max-
imal Lyapunov characteristic exponent of two initially very
close orbits. This method is extremely fast in determining
the ordered or chaotic nature of individual orbits, even to

ponents (e.g. sticky orbits, S´andor et al. 2004), as well as to
distinguish between ordered and chaotic regions of the phase
space. According to our experiments, gained in diﬀerent dy-
namical problems, it is enough to integrate the two initially
close orbits for a few hundred times of the longest orbital
period of the investigated system. As to the FLI, their time
evolution shows clearly the ordered or chaotic character of
an orbit, and the method is very eﬀective in detecting sta-
ble resonant orbits. Concerning the computation of the FLI,
the integration time is several tens of thousands orbital peri-
ods. In the MEM we compute by numerical integration the
largest value of the orbital eccentricity, reached by an or-
bit during a given, long time interval (105 orbital periods in
this paper). These methods have been successfully applied
to several exoplanetary systems to determine their dynam-
ical stability properties: for the RLI see (´Erdi et al. 2004;
S´andor et al. 2004), for the FLI (Pilat-Lohinger & Dvorak
2002; Dvorak et al. 2003; Bois et al. 2003), and for the MEM
(Dvorak et al. 2003; ´Erdi et al. 2004).

We compiled a catalogue of dynamical stability, adapted to
a system consisting of a star with mass m0, a giant planet
with mass m1, and a small test planet with negligible mass.
The total mass of the star and the giant planet is taken as
unit mass, thus µ = m1/(m0 + m1) is the mass parameter of

in 23 values for µ. The giant planet was assumed to move
around the star in an elliptic orbit, whose plane is taken
as reference plane, with semi-major axis a1, eccentricity e1,
argument of periastron ω1, and mean anomaly M1. Without
the loss of generality, the semi-major axis a1 can be taken

The catalogue consists of 552 stability maps, corre-

ues of M1 for outer orbits (184 maps) of the test planet.
For a given (µ, M1) pair the stability map is prepared in
such a way, that for each set of the described initial con-

ditions the RLI (or FLI) value of the corresponding or-
bit of the test planet is computed and visualized in the
(a, e1) parameter plane. Due to the very small stepsize in
a and e1, each stability map corresponds to more than
8 × 104 initial conditions, thus providing a very ﬁne res-
olution. In the following section we show some stability
maps from the catalogue, containing the HZs of some ex-
oplanetary systems as examples. The complete catalogue
is available at http://astro.elte.hu/exocatalogue and
http://www.astro.univie.ac.at/adg.

correspond to large values of the RLI (10
haviour of the test planet. The dark unstable regions on the
left are due to the proximity of the giant planet. The ﬁg-
ure is dominated by V-shaped gray stripes, corresponding
to outer mean motion resonances between the test planet
and the giant planet. These resonances, marked at the top
of the ﬁgure, can represent either ordered (stable for inﬁnite
time), or weakly chaotic (which may become unstable after
very long time) behaviour. With the increase of e1 many res-
onances overlap, giving rise to strongly chaotic and thus very
unstable behaviour. The reason for this is that by increasing
e1 the apocenter distance of the giant planet also increases,
and the giant planet perturbs more strongly the outer test
planet. The ﬁgure also shows, for two planetary systems, the
positions of the zero age HZ, which we call the classical HZ,
and the present HZ. We recall, that the habitable zone (HZ)
is that region around a star, where water can exist in liquid
phase on the surface of a planet by virtue of stellar irradi-
ance. The boundaries of the classical HZ are calculated by
assuming the physical properties of a zero age main sequence
star, while the boundaries of the present HZ depend also on
the age of the hosting star (Jones et al. 2006). The borders
of the classical HZs for a large number of extrasolar plane-
tary systems are given by Menou & Tabachnik (2003), while
the borders of the present HZs can be found in the more re-
cent work of Jones et al. (2006). We note that according to
the latter work the present HZs are shifted outwards with
respect to the location of the classical HZs.

Fig. 2 shows a stability map for the same initial condi-
tions as in Fig. 1, but resulting from the FLI computations.
It has the same overall structure, as the map obtained by
the RLI. Note, however, the complementary character of the
results obtained by the two methods. The RLI detects the
chaotic separatrices of the resonances (dark V-shaped stripes
in Fig. 1), while the FLI ﬁnds the stable resonant orbits in-
side the resonances (light stripes inside the resonances in
◦
Fig. 2). Note, that for the given initial conditions (M1 = 0
)
almost all resonances can have stable orbits, but the 1:3 res-
onance is chaotic according to both methods, a well known
result for the 3:1 inner resonance (Wisdom 1983).

Fig. 3 has been calculated by the MEM, again for the
same initial conditions as in Figs. 1 and 2. It can be seen,
that similarly to the RLI and the FLI, the MEM also indi-

4

cates the mean motion resonances. Since in the MEM orbits
were integrated for 105 periods of the giant planet, we used
it as a test of the two other chaos detection methods.

Figs. 4 and 5 show stability maps for outer orbits of the
test planet, computed by the RLI for µ = 0.002 and µ =
0.007, respectively. It can be seen, that for larger values of µ
the chaotic regions are more extended, due to the stronger
perturbing eﬀect of the giant planet.

◦
(Figs. 6a) and M1 = 180

In Figs. 6 –10 we display cases where the semi-major
axis of the test planet is smaller than that of the giant
planet (a < 1). Two panels for µ = 0.001 (Figs. 6a and
6b) show the results for two diﬀerent starting positions of
◦
the giant planet, M1 = 0
(Figs.
6b ). Here again mean motion resonances, this time inner
ones, between the test planet and the giant planet domi-
nate the stability maps. Inside the resonances the stable or
chaotic behaviour of the test planet depends on the initial
angular positions of the two planets. This is clearly visi-
ble, when we compare the two panels. In Fig. 6a the giant
planet starts from the pericenter, in Fig. 6b from the apoc-
enter, while the initial position of the test planet in both
◦
cases is at M = 0
, corresponding to the direction of the
giant planet’s pericenter. Comparing the two ﬁgures it can
be seen that the location of the resonances does not change,
since this depends on the ratio of the semi-major axes of
the two planets. However, the character of the resonances
becomes diﬀerent. In Fig. 6b several resonances (5:2, 5:3,
3:2) are more stable than in Fig. 6a. This is due to the fact
that the relative initial positions determine the places of con-
junctions of the two planets. If they meet regularly near the
pericentre of the giant planet, the motion of the test planet
becomes chaotic, while it can remain regular if the conjunc-
tions take place near the apocenter of the giant planet. The
eﬀect of the initial phase diﬀerence between the planets is
important, therefore we prepared stability maps for more
initial values of the mean anomaly M1 of the giant planet.
The essential role of the phases for computations of orbits in
mean motion resonances for terrestrial planets in exoplan-
etary systems has already been stressed by Asghari et al.
(2004), where the giant planet was initially in periastron or
apastron, and the phase of the terrestrial planet has been
set to 12 diﬀerent initial angles of the mean anomaly. (A
detailed treatment of the geometry of the resonances can be
found in Murray & Dermott 1999).

By studying the series of Figs. 6 - 10, one can follow
the eﬀect of the increase of the mass parameter on the sta-
bility structure. For larger mass of the giant planet, thus for
larger perturbations, the chaotic region is more extended, as
expected.

We note also a peculiar feature of Figs. 6a, 7 – 10. In the
strongly chaotic regions on the right, which are due to the
proximity of the giant planet, there are two almost parallel
light stripes, corresponding to satellite-type orbits around
the giant planet. These orbits are less chaotic (or they may
be ordered), than those emanating from the surrounding re-
gion. Between these stripes the dark gap corresponds to the
perihelion distance of the giant planet, therefore in orbits
originating from here, the test particles suﬀer close encoun-
ters with the giant planet, or they even can collide with it.

5 APPLICATION OF THE CATALOGUE TO
INDIVIDUAL EXOPLANETARY SYSTEMS

In this section we show how to use the catalogue to de-
termine the stability of hypothetical Earth-like planets in
exoplanetary sytems. As an example we consider the case
of HD10697, where a1 = 2.13 AU, e1 = 0.11, µ = 0.0055.
Fig. 9 shows a stability map, calculated for µ = 0.005 for
inner orbits of the test planet. This corresponds to the
minimum mass of the giant planet (minimum masses are
used throughout). The stability of a small planet (start-
ing with e = 0) in the system HD10697 can be studied
along the line e1 = 0.11. One can see, that for small semi-
major axes, a < 0.33a1(= 0.729AU) the parameter space is
very stable. When a > 0.33a1 several resonances appear,
among which the most important are the 5 : 1, 4 : 1,
3 : 1, and 2 : 1 resonances. For a > 0.73a1(= 1.55AU) a
strongly chaotic region appears. The classical HZ of this sys-
tem is between 0.85 − 1.65 AU (Menou & Tabachnik 2003).
Thus in Fig. 9 the scaled classical HZ is situated between
0.85/a1 = 0.39 and 1.65/a1 = 0.77 (shown as a rectan-
gle, elongated in horizontal direction). One can see, that the
inner part of the classical HZ contains ordered regions, but
stripes of certain resonances are also present. The outer part
of the classical HZ is in the strongly chaotic region.

In Table 1 we list the orbital parameters of the ex-
oplanetary systems displayed in Figs. 1–10, and we char-
acterize the stability properties of their hypothetical ter-
restrial planets in their classical and present HZs given by
Menou & Tabachnik (2003) and Jones et al. (2006). We give
also the boundaries of the stable and the strongly chaotic
regions. As sources for the parameters we used the web-
pages http://www.exoplanets.org and Jean Schneider’s
catalogue (http://exoplanet.eu), denoted by E and JS, re-
spectively, in Table 1 and in the ﬁgures, when there were sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences between the data. In the column MMRs
we display the highest and the lowest order mean motion res-
onances of the given exoplanetary system (not only in their
HZ), the other resonances between them can be taken from
the corresponding ﬁgure. When the highest order resonance
is above 9 : 1, we call it as h.o.r. In the column CHZ/PHZ
we give a characterization of the stability properties of the
classical and present HZs. The notation S means a fully sta-
ble HZ, where no mean motion resonance exists. When the
HZ contains a few resonances, we consider it partly stable
(PS). If many resonances ﬁll in the HZ, we call it marginally
stable (MS). Strongly chaotic, thus very unstable domains
are denoted by SC.

The uncertainty in the eccentricity e1 of a giant planet
can aﬀect the stability of the HZ signiﬁcantly. The uncer-
tainty in e1 is indicated on the stability maps by the width of
the rectangle of the classical HZ. (In the case of the present
HZ, marked by parentheses, we did not show the uncertainty
in e1, since it is the same.) When the uncertainty in e1 is
large, the stability properties at the top and at the bottom
of the rectangle of the classical HZ can be quite diﬀerent.
For instance, in the case of the system HD 30177 it can be
seen from Fig. 10, that for small values of e1 there are a few
resonances in the classical HZ, thus it is partly stable, while
for high values of e1 the HZ is full of resonances, therefore
it is only marginally stable.

6 COMPARISON WITH OTHER RESULTS

The habitability of individual exoplanetary systems has
been studied by many authors. As we have already men-
tioned, the orbital parameters of these systems are changed
quite frequently, so it is not an easy task to compare di-
rectly our results with the results of other authors using
older or diﬀerent orbital data. On the other hand, there are
only a few works studying the habitability of a large portion
of the known systems. Such global investigations have been
made by Menou & Tabachnik (2003) studying the habitabil-
ity of 85 known exoplanetary sytems, and more recently by
Jones et al. (2006) investigating the present habitability of
152 exoplanetary sytems.

In these studies the gravitational inﬂuence of the known
giant planet on the HZ is estimated mainly by some mul-
tiple of its Hill radius. However, the stability properties of
the HZ of an exoplanetary system are also aﬀected by mean
motion resonances. If the HZ of a system contains only a few
resonances, the ordered regions between them can provide
stability for an Earth-like planet. If the resonances cover
densely the HZ, the long term stability of an Earth-like
planet is more questionable; either the resonances overlap
each other generating a strongly chaotic region, or chaotic
diﬀusion, acting inside a mean motion resonance, can desta-
bilize the motion of a hypothetical small planet. We note
that the presence of additional, yet undetected giant plan-
ets in an extrasolar planetary system can enhance the deple-
tion of the mean motion resonances through their possible
secular interactions with the known giant planet, similarly
to the formation of the Kirkwood gaps in our Solar system
(Morbidelli & Moons 1993; Moons & Morbidelli 1995).

In our stability maps we investigated the dynamical
stability of the classical HZ given by Menou & Tabachnik
(2003), and the present HZ calculated by Jones et al. (2006).
Studying the dynamical stability of the classical and the
present HZs of 15 extrasolar planetary systems (displayed in
Table 1), we have found quite good agreement with the re-
sults of Menou & Tabachnik (2003) and Jones et al. (2006).
We emphasize, however, that our stability maps also exhibit
the resonant structure of the HZs, which is essential to es-
tablish the real stability properties of an Earth-like planet.
In what follows we characterize the HZ of some individ-

ual exoplanetary systems.

HD 52256 and HD 121504: Depending on the data source,
the classical HZ of the system HD 121504 is either fully sta-
ble (source E), or partly stable (source JS), containing a few
resonances (Fig. 1). The classical HZ of the system HD 52256
is partly stable, but contains more resonances and smaller
stability regions for the data JS, than for E. The present
HZs of these systems are located in the very regular regions
of the (a, e1) parameter plane with a few resonances in the
case of HD 52256 for the data JS. Our results are in good
agreement with the results of Menou & Tabachnik (2003)
and Jones et al. (2006) concerning the extension of the sta-
bility regions. These systems could harbor stable habitable
Earth-like planets.

HD 8574: The classical HZ of this system is in the strongly
chaotic region for both data sources E and JS (Fig. 4).

Figure 1. Stability map, computed by the RLI for outer orbits of
the test planet, when µ = 0.001 and M1 = 0◦. The classical HZs
of two exoplanetary sytems (with orbital parameters taken from
two diﬀerent data sources, denoted by E and JS, see Section 5) are
also indicated as elongated rectangles, whose width corresponds
to the uncertainty in the eccentricity of the giant planet’s orbit of
each system. The inner borders of the present HZs are displayed as
opened parentheses. The outer borders are out of the investigated
range of the (a, e1) plane. As described in Sections 5 and 6, it can
be seen, that depending on the data source the classical HZ of
the system HD 121504 is either fully stable (source E), or partly
stable (source JS), containing a few resonances. The system HD
52265 is partly stable, but contains more resonances and smaller
regions of stability for the data JS, than for E. The present HZs
are located in the very regular regions of the (a, e1) plane.

approach clearly shows that the present HZ of the system
is full with overlaping mean motion resonances, and only
partly stable for the data E, and marginally stable for the
data JS. Thus the chance for the system to host a stable
habitable planet is small.

Fig. 5 reveals the increase of the chaotic region for increasing µ.

cal HZ of this system is unlikely to host habitable Earth-like
planets. The classical HZ of HD 178911 B is partly stable,
and it can contain stable Earth-like planets. Our results are
in good agreement with the results of Menou & Tabachnik
(2003). The present HZs of these systems are in the or-
dered regions of the (a, e1) plane, thus these systems can
host Earth-like habitable planets in stable orbits. These re-
sults agree well with the results of Jones et al. (2006).

Eps Eri, HD 114729, and GJ 777 A: The classical HZs of
Eps Eri and HD 114729 are marginally stable (Fig. 6).
There is only a small chance to ﬁnd Earth-like planets here.

Figure 5. Stability map, computed by the RLI for outer orbits
of the test planet, when µ = 0.007 and M1 = 0◦. As described
in Section 6, the classical HZ of 70 Vir is partly in the strongly
chaotic region, while its other part is marginally stable. The clas-
sical HZ of the system HD 178911 B is partly stable. The present
HZ of HD 178911 B (denoted by parenthesis) is stable, while at
70 Vir it is partly stable, containing higher order mean motion
resonances (1:8, 1:9, etc., not shown in the ﬁgure).

Jones et al. (2006) found that only 17% of the present HZ
of Eps Eri can have stable orbits, and nowhere in HD114729
does so. In the case of GJ 777 A, due to the large uncer-
tainty in e1 of the giant planet (e1 = 0.48 ± 0.2), the classi-
cal HZ can be stable (for e1 = 0.48 − 0.2), or partly stable
(for e1 = 0.48). There are no computed stability data for
e1 > 0.5, however, the stable region will certainly decrease
for larger values of e1. The present HZ of GJ 777 A for
e1 = 0.48 is partly in the strongly chaotic region of the
(a, e1) plane, while its remaining part is ﬁlled by overlap-
ing mean motion resonances and is marginally stable. For
e1 = 0.28, the present HZ of GJ 777 A is partly stable.
Jones et al. (2006) found that 64% of the present HZ can
survive the gravitational inﬂuence of the giant planet. How-
ever, even though resonances were included in the develop-
ment of their fast method of assessing stability (Jones et al.
2005), the method does not permit detailed consideration
of the resonances in the individual systems to which it
was applied. Considering the classical HZ, this system can
host stable Earth-like planets, as has also been found by
Menou & Tabachnik (2003) and Asghari et al. (2004).

HD 70642: The classical HZ of this system can be stable,
or partly stable, depending on the eccentricity of the giant
planet (Fig. 7). The present HZ of the system contains a
few mean motion resonances, but between them there are
ordered regions, which can host stable Earth-like planets.
This result has also been found by Jones et al. (2006).

HD 72659: The classical HZ of this system contains only
a few mean motion resonances (Fig. 8), thus it can host
stable Earth-like planets. This is in good agreement with
the results of Menou & Tabachnik (2003) and Asghari et al.
(2004). Jones et al. (2006) found, that 71% of the present HZ
is not disrupted gravitationally by the giant planet. This is
true, if one considers only the eﬀect of the strongly chaotic
region. However, the inner part of the present HZ is full with

uncertainty of the eccentricity of the giant planet, the classical

present HZ of this system is partly stable within the lower and
upper limits of e1.

HZ of the system HD 72659 is partly stable. The outer part of
the present HZ of the system is chaotic, while its inner part is
marginally stable. We placed also the classical HZ of the multiple
planet system 47 UMa on the ﬁgure for comparison, by taking into
account from its two giant planets the more massive component

14 Her: Considering the classical HZ, this system can host
stable Earth-like planets, however, mean motion resonances
ﬁll densely the classical HZ (Fig. 9). As to the present HZ,
the place for a stable Earth-like planet is much smaller, with
one part in the chaotic region, and the other is ﬁlled by
many resonances. Our results are in good agreement with
the results of Jones et al. (2006).

strongly chaotic region, while its inner part between the
mean motion resonances contains ordered, thus stable re-

Figure 6. Stability maps, computed by the RLI for inner orbits
of the test planet. (a) µ = 0.001, M1 = 0◦; (b) µ = 0.001, M1 =
180◦. The comparison of the two ﬁgures shows the eﬀect of the
relative starting positions of the two planets (for more details see
the text in Section 4). As described in Section 6, the classical
HZs of Eps Eri and HD 114729 are marginally stable. Due to the
large uncertainty of the giant planet’s eccentricity, the classical
HZ of GJ 777 A can be stable (for e1 = 0.28), or partly stable
(for e1 = 0.48). The HZ of the Solar System is placed on the
map under the approximate condition that there is only one giant
planet, Jupiter in the system. It is reassuring that the HZ of the
Solar System is in the stable region. The present HZ of GJ 777 A
for e1 = 0.48 is partly in the chaotic region, while its other part
is marginally stable, and for e1 = 0.28 it is partly stable.

mean motion resonances and is marginally stable. Thus the
place for a stable Earth-like planet is much smaller, than
71% of the whole present HZ, when the eﬀects of the mean
motion resonances are taken into consideration. However,
the presence of an Earth-like planet cannot be excluded en-
tirely.

HD 50554: Both the classical and the present HZ of this
system are entirely in the strongly chaotic region of the
(a, e1) plane (Fig. 9). Thus this system can not host habit-
able Earth-like planet. Jones et al. (2006) came to the same
conclusion. On the other hand, there could be (retrograde)
satellite-type orbits in the system.

Figure 9. Stability map, computed by the RLI for inner orbits
of the test planet, when µ = 0.005 and M1 = 0◦. Along the line
e1 = 0.11, corresponding to the system HD 10697, the parameter
space is very stable for a < 0.33. For a > 0.73 the parameter
space is strongly chaotic. Between 0.33 < a < 0.73 there are
several resonances. The scaled classical HZ of the system HD
10697 is between 0.39 < a < 0.77, thus its inner part is partly
stable, but its outer edge is strongly chaotic. So is its present
HZ. As described in Section 6, both the classical and the present
HZ of the system HD 50554 are strongly chaotic. Interestingly,
there could be (retrograde) satellite-type orbits in this system.
The classical HZ of 14 Her is partly stable, while its present HZ
is chaotic on one side, and marginally stable on the other.

Figure 10. Stability map, computed by the RLI for inner orbits
of the test planet, when µ = 0.009 and M1 = 0◦. Due to the large
uncertainty in the eccentricity of the giant planet, the classical HZ
of the system HD 30177 is either partly stable (at the bottom of
the rectangle), or marginally stable (at the top of the rectangle).
The present HZ is strongly chaotic for large values of e1, while
its inner part is partly or marginally stable.

gions as well (Fig. 9). The present HZ of this system is in
the strongly chaotic region, thus it cannot harbour stable
Earth-like planets. This is also found by Jones et al. (2006).
HD 30177: The classical HZ of this system may host Earth-
like planets, since between the mean motion resonances
there are ordered regions on the (a, e1) parameter plane
(Fig. 10). Considering the present HZ, its outer part is in the
strongly chaotic region, while the inner part of it may con-
tain stable Earth-like planets. This result agrees well with
the result of Jones et al. (2006).

Thus we can conclude, that the eﬀect of the mean mo-
tion resonances cannot be neglected, when studying the hab-
itability of the known extrasolar planetary systems. In this
sense our work complements the already existing studies,
such as Jones et al. (2006).

7 SUMMARY

In this paper we described a catalogue of stability maps
of hypothetical terrestrial planets in exoplanetary systems
with one giant planet. By using these maps, one can easily
study the stability properties of possible Earth-like planets
and the habitable zones in known or future exoplanetary
systems. The novelty of our work is the invariance of our re-
sults with respect to the frequent changes in the computed
orbital parameters of the extrasolar planetary systems. Thus
any new orbital determination (leading to new elements) can
immediately be checked without any time-consuming com-
putations. This catalogue could also be useful for observing

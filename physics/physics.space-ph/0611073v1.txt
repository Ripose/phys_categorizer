ABSTRACT

sian coordinate system, this matrix can be written

We present a systematic and physically motivated char-
acterization of incoherent or coherent electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds, as measured for instance by the low fre-
quency receiver on-board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft.
The characterization utilizes the 36 auto/cross correla-
tions of the 3 + 3 complex Cartesian components of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds; hence, they are second or-
der in the ﬁeld strengths and so have physical dimension
energy density. Although such 6 × 6 correlation matri-
ces have been successfully employed on previous space
missions, they are not physical quantities; because they
are not manifestly space-time tensors. In this paper we
propose a systematic representation of the 36 degrees-of-
freedom of partially coherent electromagnetic ﬁelds as a
set of manifestly covariant space-time tensors, which we
call the Canonical Electromagnetic Observables (CEO).
As an example, we apply this formalism to analyze real
data from a chorus emission in the mid-latitude magne-
tosphere, as registered by the STAFF-SA instrument on
board the Cluster-II spacecraft. We ﬁnd that the CEO
analysis increases the amount of information that can be
extracted from the STAFF-SA dataset; for instance, the
reactive energy ﬂux density, which is one of the CEO pa-
rameters, identiﬁes the source region of electromagnetic
emissions more directly than the active energy (Poynting)
ﬂux density alone.

Key words: electromagnetic, observables, correlation,
space-time, covariant, irreducible, tensor, Cluster.

This electromagnetic (EM) sixtor matrix has in various
guises, such as Wave-distribution functions (WDF) (1)
and so on, been useful in the analysis of EM vector ﬁeld
data from spacecraft, such as on the Cluster and Polar
missions. Although this matrix-form description of the
second order properties of the EM ﬁelds can in some in-
stances be convenient and intuitive, it unfortunately has
no real motivation in physics, since physical quantities
such as EM ﬁelds are ultimately not sixtors.

The EM sixtor matrix lists all possible auto and cross cor-
relations of E(x, t) and B(x, t) and, hence, contains the
complete information of the second order properties of

density1 |E|2 + |B|2 by taking the trace of the EM six-
tor matrix but it is not clear what other EM quantities
can be extracted and how this extraction should be per-
formed in general. Some EM quantities are obvious and
can be picked out by hand, such as the Lagrangian den-
sity |E|2 − |B|2, the Poynting ﬂux density ℜ{E × ¯B},
etc; ¯B denotes the complex conjugate of B, etc. Other
EM quantities are not so easily identiﬁed. Furthermore,
as it stands here, the EM sixtor matrix is a mixture of
both scalar and pseudo scalar components. This is due
to E being a proper (polar) vector and B being a pseudo
(axial) vector. This could be remedied by for instance us-
ing the sixtor (E, ±iB) but then again, it is unclear what
sign to use for the imaginary unit, i. Regardless of how
the sign of i is chosen one would need to redeﬁne the EM
quantities. The trace of the modiﬁed proper EM sixtor
matrix would in this case correspond to the Lagrangian
density rather than the EM energy density, which in turn
would have to be redeﬁned. Other EM quantities would
also need to be redeﬁned in non-standard ways.

When analyzing time varying electric and magnetic vec-
tor ﬁeld data from spacecraft, it is common to construct a
6 × 6 matrix from the complex sixtor (E, B). In a Carte-

1Throughout the paper, when second order ﬁeld quantities are dis-
cussed we have chosen a normalization such that the speed of light is
set to unity.

Perhaps even more important for space borne observa-
the EM sixtor matrix is not covariant according
tions:
to the requirements of special relativity. Spacecraft are
constantly moving and often spinning observation plat-
forms. EM wave measurements become Doppler shifted
and data must often be “despun”. For the 3 × 3 sub-
matrices, E ⊗ ¯E, E ⊗ ¯B, B ⊗ ¯E, and B ⊗ ¯B, where ⊗
denote the direct product, despinning is straight forward
by applying rotation matrices R from left and RT from
right, e.q. E′ ⊗ ¯E′ = RE ⊗ ¯ERT. To rotate the full EM
sixtor matrix, similar operations must be performed four
times. This is awkward and the resulting 6 × 6 matrix is
still not covariant. For EM wave measurements in space
plasma the last remark can be crucial.

A Lorentz boost is the translation from one Lorentz frame
to another one moving at velocity v. A Lorentz boost
does not necessarily imply relativistic speeds, which is
a common misconception; and therefore it do not by it-
self preclude what is typically associated with relativis-
tic effects.
It is simply a quite general recipe to make
two different observers agree on a physical observation.
The Lorentz boost of the EM ﬁeld vectors can be written
E′ = γ(E+v×B) and B′ = γ(B−v×E/c2), where c is
1 − v2/c2. As a matter of
the speed of light and γ = 1/
fact, the Lorentz boost is the essence of the well-known
frozen-in ﬁeld line theorem2 from magnetohydrodynam-
ics (MHD); a theory which is commonly used to model
the solar wind plasma. In a plasma, relativity comes into
play at very a fundamental level since the electromagnetic
(Lorentz) force dominates the vast majority of all plasma
interactions.

Another example illustrates the problem to separate time
(frequency) and space (wave vector) in EM wave obser-
vations on board a spacecraft. Assume that we observe a
wave mode which is described by an angular frequency
ω and wave vector k. We can write this as a 4-vector
(ω, ck). Let’s make a Lorentz boost in the v direction:

(2)

What happens now for a stationary (DC) ﬁeld structure
moving with the solar wind plasma? We then have ω = 0
and |ck| 6= 0. For a satellite moving with velocity v
relative to the DC ﬁeld structure, it is justiﬁed to set γ ≈ 1
(the solar wind speed seldom reaches more than 900 km/s
and using this value we obtain γ ≈ 1.0000045 & 1); Eqs.
(1) and (2) are then reduced to

′

ω
ck′

≈ −k · v
≈ ck

(3)
(4)

We can see that the DC ﬁeld structure is not Lorentz con-
tracted appreciably at this low velocity, k′ ≈ k. How-
ever, there is a dramatic change in the observed fre-
quency, which for a head-on encounter with the structure

though they are convected with velocity v, i.e., they are frozen to the
plasma ﬂow. This is the frozen-in ﬁeld line theorem of ideal MHD.

is registered as ω′ ≈ kv rather than zero. The observed
frequency is proportional to the dimension of the struc-
ture, which we take to be in the order of one wavelength,
λ = 2π/k. Taking v = 900 km/s a 900 km DC ﬁeld
structure would now register as 1 Hz, a 90 km structure
as 10 Hz, and a 9 km structure as 100 Hz, etc.

These simple examples clearly show that a space-time
(covariant) description is necessary even if γ & 1. The
frequency (time) and the associated wave vector (space)
can not be treated separately but must be considered to-
gether, as a space-time 4-tensor.

The Maxwell equations are inherently relativistic and can
easily be put into a covariant form using 4-tensors. From
a theoretical point of view, this fact alone provides a very
good argument why one should try to express also the
second order properties of the EM ﬁelds using a covari-
ant formalism. This was recently carried out by the au-
In this pa-
thors and published in a recent paper (2).
per we introduced a complete set of space-time tensors,
which can fully describe the second order properties of
EM waves. We call this set of tensors the Canonical Elec-
tromagnetic Observables (CEO); in analogy with Wolf’s
analysis of the Stokes parameters (3). We suggest that
the CEO could be used as an alternative to the EM six-
tor matrix. Not only are the CEO covariant, but they
are all real valued and provide a useful decomposition of
the sixtor matrix into convenient physical quantities, es-
pecially in the three-dimensional (3D), so-called scalar-
vector-tensor (SVT) classiﬁcation; see section 2.2. The
CEO have all dimension energy density but have various
physical interpretations as will be discussed in what fol-
lows.

2. CANONICAL ELECTROMAGNETIC OB-

SERVABLES

The CEO set was derived from the complex Maxwell
ﬁeld strength F αβ. Other possibilities, such as using the
4-potential Aµ or using a spinor formalism (4), were con-
sidered but discarded due to their lack of physical con-
tent. The 4-potential is not directly measurable and it is
furthermore gauge dependent. Spinor formalism has been
proved possible to use (5) but we believe the space-time
tensor formalism to be more intuitive and convenient to
use.

In the quantum theory of light, observables of an EM ﬁeld
are ultimately constructed from a complex ﬁeld strength;
see (3). The simplest of these observables are sesquilinar-
quadratic (Hermitian quadratic) in F αβ, i.e., they are
functions of the components of F αβ ¯F γδ, which is a 4-
tensor of rank four. We showed that it was possible to de-
compose F αβ ¯F γδ into a unique set of tensors, the CEO,
which are real irreducible under the full Lorentz group.
We shall not repeat the derivation here but will instead
discuss the space-time (4-tensor) and three-dimensional
(3-tensor) representations of the CEO.

mental space-time representation of the CEO; their prop-

The symmetric second rank tensor T αβ is the well-known
EM energy-stress tensor, which contains the total energy,
ﬂux (Poynting vector), and stress (Maxwell stress tensor)
densities. The other two second rank tensors, U αβ and
Qαβ, respectively, are less well-known. The symmetric
U αβ tensor is similar to T αβ in that it contains active
energy densities but in U αβ these densities are weighted
and depend on the the handedness (spin, helicity, polar-
ization, chirality) of the EM ﬁeld. Therefore, we have
chosen to call them “handed” energy densities. The anti-
symmetric tensor Qαβ on the other hand is very different
in that it only contains reactive energy densities, which
are both total (imaginary part of the complex Poynting
vector) and handed.

This real irreducible rank four tensor, Eq. (11), was dis-
covered by us3 and published in (2), and is still under
investigation; it is an extremely interesting geometrical
object, having a structure identical to the Weyl tensor in
general relativity; see (6). We have found that it contains
a four-dimensional generalization of the Stokes param-
eters, as will be demonstrated in section 3 for the two-
dimensional (2D) case. It contains both reactive total and
reactive handed energy densities.

2.2. Three-dimensional representation

The fundamental space-time 4-tensor CEO can be written
in terms of the three-dimensional E and B vectors, i.e.,
3-tensors. This is convenient because it allows us to use
intuitive physical quantities. To systematize the 3D rep-
resentation of the CEO, we will use a physical classiﬁca-
tion where we organize the CEO into four groups, which
have been introduced brieﬂy in the previous section: the
(active) total, (active) handed, reactive total, and reactive
handed CEO parameter groups, respectively. In addition,
we will use a coordinate-free 3D formalism and classify
the CEO parameters according to rank, i.e., as scalars, 3-
vectors, and rank two 3-tensors (SVT classiﬁcation). The
3D CEO are listed in Table 2.2. The CEO 3-tensors are
deﬁned as follows.

The “total” parameters are:

Contrary to the active,
groups above, the reactive total parameter group have no
single corresponding 4-tensor. Instead it is composed of
parts from three different CEO space-time tensors: the
(5), the re-
vacuum proper-Lagrangian deﬁned by Eq.
active energy ﬂux density from Eq. (10), and the gen-
eralized Stokes parameters corresponding to the auto-
correlated E and B ﬁelds from Eq. (11).

Also for this parameter group, there is no single corre-
sponding 4-tensor. The reactive handed group is com-
posed of parts from three CEO space-time tensors: the
vacuum pseudo-Lagrangian, deﬁned by Eq. (6), the re-
(10), and
active handed energy ﬂux density from Eq.
the generalized Stokes parameters corresponding to the
cross-correlated E and B ﬁelds from Eq. (11).

Up until now we have assumed that all three Cartesian
components of both the electric ﬁeld, E, and the mag-
netic ﬁeld, B, are measured. One may ask what happens
if some components are not measured; can all the 36 pa-
rameters of the CEO be retained? Of course this is not
possible, some information is certainly lost in this case,
but what one can do is to construct a set of parameters
analogous to CEO in two-dimensions.

Assume that we can measure the electric ﬁeld and the
magnetic ﬁeld in a plane which we can say is the xy-
plane without loss of generality. Let the two-dimensional

E2D ⊗ B2D =

ExBx ExBy
EyBx EyBy (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(26)

We will however not need to consider all the components
of the 2D direct product since the 2-tensors we will con-
sider are all symmetric and traceless. Hence, we only
want the parameters which correspond to Pauli spin ma-
trix components

0 −1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

(27)

(28)

The Pauli components can be extracted from a 2D matrix
by matrix multiplying by a Pauli spin matrix and then
taking the trace, that is

Tr {(E2D ⊗ B2D) σx} = (E2D ⊗ B2D) · ·σx

= ExBy + EyBx

(29)

where we have introduced the double scalar product, σx ·
·σy, see (7).

We can derive a set of two-dimensional canonical elec-
tromagnetic parameters from the full CEO by formally
taking

Ez ≡ Bz ≡ 0

(30)

and discarding all the parameters that are identically zero.
In this way we obtain the following set, which we write
in the coordinate-free 2D formalism introduced above.

We can associate names with these parameters as listed
in Table 3. The ﬁrst four parameters, which we call the
“total” 2D CEO parameters are all well known. These
parameters are also known by different names, e.g., the
total energy ﬂux is also known as the Poynting vector
(z-component), and the total energy stress is known as
the Maxwell stress tensor (difference of diagonal com-
ponents and off-diagonal component). The remaining
three sets of 2D CEO parameters are less well known.
We will not be able to provide a full physical interpre-
tation of each of these parameters; indeed their role in
space plasma physics is yet to be fully explored. We will
only mention that the “handed” parameters involve spin
(helicity, chirality, polarization) weighted energy, i.e.,
the energy of the right-hand wave modes are weighted
positively and the energy of left-hand wave modes are

weighted negatively, and these weighted energies are then
added.
Its ﬂux corresponds to the concept of elliptic-
ity and for the case of vacuum, it is numerically equiva-
lent to Stokes V parameter. The reactive energy densities
come in two groups: the “reactive total” and the “reac-
tive handed” 2D CEO parameter groups. From the “re-
active total” group, we now recognize the reactive energy
ﬂux density, as well as the EM Stokes Q and U parame-
ters, which here are of the auto-type; the vacuum proper-
Lagrangian needs no further introduction. The “reactive
handed” group contain the handed counterparts of the re-
active energy ﬂux density and EM Stokes parameters,
which here are of the cross-typer; the vacuum pseudo-
Lagrangian is well-known.

4. APPLICATION OF CEO TO CLUSTER DATA

Let us demonstrate that the CEO parameters can easily
be computed from actual data. Assuming that we have
measurements from a vector magnetometer and an elec-
tric ﬁeld instrument, all that is required is to auto/cross-
correlate all measured components and then form the ap-
propriate linear combination introduced above.

As an example we will consider the STAFF-SA dataset
on the Cluster-II space-craft mission (9). The STAFF-
SA instrument (10) is well suited for the CEO parame-
ters since it outputs auto/cross-correlation of electric and
magnetic ﬁeld components; however as Cluster does not
measure one of the electric ﬁeld components (namely the
component normal to the spin-plane of the space-craft)
we can only use the 2D version of the CEO introduced in
the previous section.

For this particular example, we re-process the high-band
part of STAFF-SA data from an event discussed in (8)

Figure 1. Example dynamic spectra of the 16 normalized two-dimensional CEO parameters. The parameters were
computed from STAFF-SA data from Cluster space-craft 2 using the ISDAT database system. The following normalization
has been applied: each parameter has been divided by the total energy except the total energy itself. Thus all spectral
values are in dimensionless unit except for the total energy. This Figure can be compared with Fig. 1 in (8). The 16
parameters are subdivided into a) the total energy parameters, b) the handed energy parameters, c) the reactive total
energy parameters, and d) the reactive handed energy parameters. Note that all the quantities are purely electromagnetic
in origin and so do not refer to contributions from the plasma.

from 2001-03-31 UT. In Fig. 1 of this paper, Parrot et
al display certain parameters based on the STAFF-SA
data computed using a numerical software package called
PRASSADCO; see (11). The interesting feature of the
2D CEO parameters is that they are the complete set of
electromagnetic ﬁeld observables in the spin-plane of the
space-craft; and indeed, they use up all the parameters
in the STAFF-SA dataset expect for the magnetic ﬁeld in
the spin direction. Each CEO is a distinct physical quan-
tity and examination of the panels in Fig. 1 indicates that
this is indeed the case, since besides showing a common
chorus feature (the arch to the left in each panel) there are
unique points in each of the panels.

Besides being a complete description of the electro-
magnetic observables, the fact that the CEO parameters
are based on parameters that conform with the physics
of space-time means that we can expect physical phe-
nomenon to be measured properly. Seeing as how the
CEO parameters have not been explicitly measured in the
past, we can expect that their future use may lead to new
physical insights, especially since several of the parame-
ters are completely new to space-physics. As an example
consider again the data shown in Fig 1. It is interesting
to note that the reactive total energy ﬂux is only signiﬁ-
cant close to the equator; this implies that the equator is
the source region for the chorus events, since reactive en-
ergy ﬂux is typically large close to radiating objects due
to large standing energy ﬁelds. One can also see a modu-
lation at 2.5 kHz in the EM Stokes parameters. If this is
a physical phenomenon it would be indicative of Faraday
rotation. Also there seems to be frequency dispersion in
the handed stress since its components changes sign with
frequency. Finally, the handed energy clearly shows the
handedness of the chorus emissions on its own, without
recourse to the sign of the total energy ﬂux.

5. CONCLUSION

The proposed CEO parameters conveniently organize the
measurements of the full EM ﬁeld. Furthermore, they are
physically meaningful quantities, i.e. they

• have conservation laws

• transform as geometric (Minkowski space-time) ob-

jects

sors)

• are mathematically unique (they are irreducible ten-

• retain all information, i.e. nothing is lost (linear

transformation back to full sixtor form exists)

• enables considerable data reduction (through param-

eter subset selection)

• have clear despinning properties (e.g. scalar quanti-

ties do not need despinning!)

• are all real valued

• provides useful decomposition of the 36 second or-
der EM components into twelve 3-tensor quantities

• reveals some new physical parameters describing

EM waves: opening for new physical insights.

Abstract

The tangential layers are characterized by a bulk plasma velocity
and a magnetic ﬁeld that are perpendicular to the gradient direction.
They have been extensively described in the frame of the Magneto-
Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) theory. But the MHD theory does not look
inside the transition region if the transition has a size of a few ion gy-
roradii. A series of kinetic tangential equilibria, valid for a collisionless
plasma is presented. These equilibria are exact analytical solutions of
the Maxwell-Vlasov equations. The particle distribution functions are
sums of an inﬁnite number of elementary functions parametrized by a
vector potential. Examples of equilibria relevant to space plasmas are
shown. A model for the deep and sharp density depletions observed
in the auroral zone of the Earth is proposed. Tangential equilibria are
also relevant for the study of planetary environments and of remote
astrophysical plasmas.

I. INTRODUCTION

The swedish Viking spacecraft orbiting in the auroral region of the magne-
tosphere discovered deep plasma density depletions [1]. Their size along the
magnetic ﬁeld direction reach thousands of kilometers. They can be con-
sidered as channels parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. These observation were
conﬁrmed by measurements onboard the Fast Auroral SnapshoT explorer
(FAST) spacecraft [2]. The data showed a lot of plasma activity in and
around these regions, particularly plasma acceleration (at the origin of the
polar auroras) [3], electromagnetic radiation [4] and a high level of electro-
static turbulence. Most of the studies focused on the acceleration [5], [6] and
the nature of the turbulence [7], [8] [9]. But surprisingly, little work has been
devoted to the structure of these plasma cavities. Some theoretical works
have been devoted to their origin, but none has tackled the question : are
auroral plasma cavities in equilibrium, or do they vanish a soon as the cause
of their formation disapears ?

The aim of the work presented in this paper is to construct a kinetic
model of the auroral plasma cavities. But as a very general solution to this
problem is found, the ﬁeld of applications appears much wider.
I present
here a family of equilibrium solutions that can be used in many domains of
the physics of plasmas. They will be named as tangential equilibria because,
as in the MHD tangential discontinuities, the magnetic ﬁeld and the bulk
velocities are tangential to the plane (y, z) of invariance.

Previous works on tangential equilibria [10], [11] have shown the existence
of simple isothermal solutions that can be computed analytically. Other
works, mainly focused on the study of the Earth magnetopause [12], have
shown solutions that satisfy a larger class of constraints, but they cannot be
constructed analytically.

Most of these equilibria a based, for each species, on distribution functions
that are products of an exponential function of the total energy and of p2
z,
by an arbitrary g function of py,

f = (

Krall and Rosenbluth, [13] have derived a solution of the linearized ki-
netic equations, by setting g(py) as a linear function. They used this simple
solution for the study of gradient instabilities.
Many authors (reviewed by Roth et al.

[12]), who studied tangential
discontinuities, considered solutions with g functions that involve error func-
tions. Most of these studies where developed for the study of the equilibrium
of the Earth magnetopause. They include an electric ﬁeld Ex and no charge
neutrality. There is no analytical solution. The diﬀerential equations on Ex
and A are solved through a numerical integration.

Channell [11] considered solutions with no electric ﬁeld. He showed that

Jy = T⊥

dAy

.

(2)

A more general formula will be shown in Sec. II.

In the same paper, Channell studied a few examples of solutions with
simple but nonlinear g functions. In particular, he showed that there exists
a solution with g(py) = exp (

y), where η is a constant number.

ηp2

Harris [10] built an equilibrium model of a current sheet. His model was
widely used later for the study of the tearing mode instability. The Harris
current sheet equilibrium corresponds to the case g(py) = exp (νpy).

−

All the solutions mentionned above are based on elementary g functions.
They do not let the possibility of setting a priori a density proﬁle, as in the
more simple MHD and bi-ﬂuid models. We can build a distribution function
that is the sum of such elementary distribution functions and assert that
each elementary part of the distribution corresponds to a family of trapped
particles.

Because of the nonlinearity of the equations, the density and temperature
proﬁles associated to a sum of families of trapped particles are not simple
combinations of the proﬁles associated to single elementary particle distri-
butions. Nethertheless, using a numerical equation solver, Roth et al.
[12]
added up to four elementary distributions functions (all of them were built
with error functions). Diﬀerential equations were solved numerically.

I show in this paper how to combine an inﬁnite number of elementary
solutions and build a plasma that is made of a continuum of famillies of
trapped particles. The plasma equilibria presented in this paper are com-
puted analytically. They do not have the high degree of generality of those
shown in Roth et al. [12], (because I impose a null electric ﬁeld), but they

3

are more general than those of Harris [10], and Channell [11]. In particular,
the plasma does not have to be isothermal.

The equations of the kinetic model are developed and solved in Sec. II.
The properties of the solutions and some particular cases are brieﬂy analysed
in Sec. III. An equilibrium model for the deep non isothermal density deple-
tions of the Earth auroral zone is presented. The last section is a discussion
about other applications and further developments.

II. FORMULATION OF THE MAXWELL-
VLASOV MODEL

We consider a monodimensional equilibrium : ∂t = 0 and
= (dx, 0, 0).
We choose the z direction along the constant direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
~B = (0, 0, Bz(x)), (
B = 0 is therefore ensured). The magnetic ﬁeld
derives from a vector potential ~A(x) = (0, Ay(x), 0) such that Bz = dxAy.
~A = 0 in the
This vector potential satisﬁes the Lorentz gauge (that is
stationary case). The x direction is called the normal direction, the y, z
plane is the tangential plane.

∇ ·

∇·

∇

In a monodimensional equilibrium, the particles are conﬁned between two
points where vx = 0. In the case of a null electric ﬁeld, the size ∆x of this
area is

∆x = 2v⊥/ < ωc >
x2
x1 Bz(x). Absolutely no restriction on the varia-

(3)

where < ωc >= (q/m∆x)
tions of Bx is made.

R

As we look for a monodimensional equilibrium, the total energy E =
mv2
2 + qΦ of any particle and the generalized momentum py = mvy + qAy and
pz = mvz are the invariants of the motion. Any distribution function of the
form f = f (E, py, pz) is a solution of the Valsov equation. All the kinetic
solutions studied in this paper will be of that form. The other character
imposed on the solutions is a null electric ﬁeld, and therefore no charge
separation.

The basic idea is to decompose linearly the g function (already men-
tionned in Eq. 1 ) over a set of elementary distribution functions that corre-
spond to an analytical equilibrium solution. As will be shown in this section,
if the sum is parametrized by a parameter a that correspond to shifts of the

4

elementary distribution functions in the space of the potential vectors (and
not in the space of the conﬁgurations), there is an analytical solution.

For instance, we can show that a continuous linear combination of Chan-

nell and Harris-like g distribution functions given by

g(py) = n0 +

q
m

a)2 + ν(a)(

a)],

leads to an equilibrium that can be computed analytically.

The functions ng(a), η(a) > 0, and ν(a) are deﬁned almost arbitrarily
and n0 is a constant scalar. Each of these three functions provide a degree
of freedom and it is possible, as in MHD and bi-ﬂuid models, to control the
plasma density proﬁle. But the distribution of the particles depends on the
energy through an exponential factor that does not give any freedom to set
the temperature proﬁle. Therefore, instead of using 1 and 4, let us set :

f =

da (

and

tion

ga(py) = ng(a)e−η(a)(

m

− q

m a)2+ν(a)(

− q

m a).

(6)

With these distribution functions, a control of the plasma density proﬁle
(through ng(a)) and of the temperature proﬁle of each species (through αz(a)
and α⊥(a)) is possible. The parameter a is homogeneous to a vector potential.
In order not to overload the equations, we do not express systematically

the dependance of the parameters on a and x hereafter.

To solve the charge neutrality equation (ni = ne) and the Amp`ere equa-

choose the functions α⊥, η, ν, ng that correspond to a particle species, then
compute the ξ, δ and N0 functions and ﬁnd the η, ν, ng functions of the
other species that are associated with the same ξ, δ and N0. There is only
one restriction: η must be positive. If we choose electron parameters, the

reach very high values, and it is necessary to remember that vη is not an
actual velocity, it does not correspond to a propagation phenomenon.

III. EXAMPLES AND PROPERTIES OF TAN-
GENTIAL EQUILIBRIA

A. Examples of elementary solutions with parameters
relevant to space plasmas

The trivial case of a uniform plasma can be easily recovered with several sets
= 0 and ξ
of parameters (including ng 6
= 0). The case of the Harris current
sheet [10], reviewed in details in [12], can be recovered with ξ = 0, ν
= 0 and
n(a) = ngδ0, where δ0 is the Dirac distribution.

Here are a few examples of equilibria where ν = 0, ng = ncδ0, and
where the temperature functions are constant. They correspond to the case
η(py/m)2) already mentionned by Channell [11]. The ﬁgure
g(py) = nc exp (
given in Channell’s paper to illustrate this case displays the equilibrium of
an evanescent plasma. We brieﬂy show in this section a few examples of
equilibria of ﬁnite size current layers in non evanscent plasmas, in order to
emphasize a few interesting properties not discussed in Channell’s paper.

−

Figure 1 shows an example of a structure that is computed with pa-
rameters typical of high altitude auroral plasmas : asymptotic magnetic ﬁeld
√C = 3000 nT, n0 = 10cm−3, Ti = Te = 10 eV, and ηe = 1.53 10−16(m/s)−2 =
0.99ηc, very close to the critical value imposed by Eq. (28). A high nega-
8cm−3 allows for a deep density depletion. The abcsissa is
tive value nc =
normalized to the ion Larmor radius which is ρL = 152 m. We can see on
Fig. 1 that the size of the structure is about 4ρL ∼
600 m. Such a narrow
and deep structure (the density in the cavity is only 20% of the density of
the surrounding plasma) can be used in a ﬁrst approximation for the density
depletions encountered in the high altitude auroral zone.

−

The solution displayed in Fig. 2 corresponds to the limiting case for
η, obtained for the weakly magnetized interplanetary plasma encountered
in the solar wind at one astronomical unit : √C = 5 nT, n0 = 10cm−3,
Ti = Te = 100 eV, and ηe = 1.53 10−17(m/s)−2 = 0.99ηc. The ion Larmor
radius is 280 km. We can notice that for the same density depletion, the
variation of the magnetic ﬁeld is much higher than in the case of a higly
magnetized plasma. We also notice that the total size of the structure hardly
exceed one ion Larmor radius.

As the size is of the order of the ion Larmor radius, such solutions cannot
be described through the ﬂuid theories. Of course, we can also build very

9

large density structures, if we choose a small value of η in order to get a
small value of ξ. Such large structures can more simply be described by ﬂuid
models. Figure 3 shows the solution with η = 10−20(m/s)−2
10−3ηc. The
structure is much larger but has the same amplitude. Comparing Fig. 2
and Fig. 3, we can notice that, contrary to the case of solitons, there is no
correlation between the size and the amplitude of the structures.

We can caracterize two kinds of non trivial elementary solutions : those with
η
= 0, otherwise the solution
is trivial). Those of the ﬁrst kind correspond to localized solutions, they
are centered around an abscissa x such as Ay(x)
a. Therefore, when the
distribution is the inﬁnite sum of elementary functions indexed by a as in Eq.
(24), the parameter a indicates where the density na(x) is non negligible. Let
us consider an equilibria where, for x
, the magnetic ﬁeld has a ﬁnite
value. Then, the potential vector goes to inﬁnity. Taking a1 ∼ −∞
and
a2 ∼
means that the plasma distribution will be inﬂuenced by some of
those elementary functions even when x

deﬁned with ﬁnite values of a1 and a2 (and B(

with the density n0 that appears in Eq. (5).

Then, as A cannot exceed A∞, the main integral in Eq. (35) is divergent for
Ay(x) = A∞ (otherwise the equilibria would not be deﬁned for any value of
x). As the elementary solutions parametrized by a are non negligible only
for abscissas x such that Ay(x) is close to a, it is not necessary to consider
values or a2 that exceed notably A∞ : they would have no inﬂuence on the
value of the integral in Eq. (35). In brief, for equilibria with B(
) = 0, the
range of values where the parameter a is signiﬁcant is bounded, a1 and a2 do
not have to be inﬁnite.

D. Example of a non isothermal plasma cavity in the
Earth auroral zone

Are the cavities built in the Earth auroral zone in an equilibrium state of the
plasma ?

Hilgers et al. [1] made a careful analysis of the Langmuir probe current
measurements onboard the swedish Viking satellite in low plasma densities.
They showed a case, taken at an altitude of 7000 km, of a deep auroral
cavity. The density reach less than one particle per cubic centimeter, that
is less than 10 % of the surrounding plasma density. The electron plasma
temperature in the cavity (although not precisely measured) is of the order
of 1 keV, compared to 1 eV outside the cavity. The boundaries of the cavity
are sharp, Hilgers et al. measured 1.4 km, of the order of a few ion Larmor
radii. The magnetic ﬁeld amplitude is Bz0 = 6800 nT.

Apart from the temperature gradient, all these features have been qual-

side the cavity, the plasma temperature is 1 keV, and the ion Larmor ra-
dius is ρi,hot = 660m= 32ρi. We choose an electron temperature function
(a/Bz032ρi)2) that varies from 1 to 1000 eV on a

ρi,hot. The density is controled through the constant
scale ∆x
scalar n0 = 10 cm−3, and the ng function, ng(a) =
(a/Bz032ρi)2).
The scalar ng0 is set (heuristically) to 50000 in order to have one particle per
cubic centimeter inside the cavity. The ν function is null. The η function is
chosen is order to get a sharp cavity, that is with a value close to the ηc func-
tion: η(a) = 0, 98ηc(a) have values of the order of 10−15(m/s)−2. Actually,
the equilibria is not very sensitive on the value of η. Taking a lower value
like η(a) = 0.7ηc(a) (and a slightly lower value of ng0) bring similar results.
The result, displayed on Fig. 6, is in quantitative agreement with the
prescriptions given by the observations. The size of the gradient is 70ρi =
1400m, as measured by Hilgers et al.

We can notice on ﬁgure 6 that the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude variation ∆B
in the cavity is about 0.5 nT. A similar equilibria (not displayed) set with
a lower value of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld (Bz0 = 300 nT) bring a larger
variation: ∆B = 5 nT.

We conclude from this short study that deep plasma cavities can be equi-
librium structures of the Earth auroral plasma. Therefore, they won’t be
destroyed immediately after the extinction of their cause. It is however in-
teresting to know if this equilibrium is stable. The theoretical treatement of
this question goes beyhond the scope of this paper. I will only give a few
hints in favour of the stability of the auroral cavities.

The Auroral zone of the Earth is a radio source. The power of the emis-
sions, called Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR), can reach 10 MW. The
Viking spacecraft has gone through the sources of AKR: the waves are emit-
ted inside the cavities, where they take their free energy from the hot rareﬁed
plasma [7]. The waves are strongly refracted at the edges of the AKR source,
and it is probable that a part of the AKR is guided inside the cavities [14].
Auroral kilometric radiations can be observed on time scales of 10 minutes.
The cavities that contain AKR sources are expected to last at least for the
same duration. Therefore, two situations are possible : (1) the cavities are
the consequence of a phenomena that lasts for tens of minutes, or (2) they

13

are generated by more transient phenomena and they are stable.

An another hint about the stability of hot plasma cavities comes from
numerical simulations carried by Genot et al.
[9]. The simulations start
with an isothermal (a few eV) auroral cavity. The cavity is stable. An
Alfv´en wave is added. The interaction of the Alfv´en wave with the cavity
triggers strong electron acceleration and turbulence. When the free energy is
completely removed from the Alfv´en wave by the accelerated electrons, the
plasma inside the cavity is hot, and the surrounding plasma is cold. We are
in the situation shown in Fig 6. The simulations show that the heated cavity,
which is still very deep and sharp, is stable.

Most of the models about the generation of auroral cavities invoke strong
kinetic Alfv´en Waves (SKAW) [15] [16], observed onboard the Freja and
FAST satellites [17], [18]. The associated magnetic ﬁeld perturbation ∆B is
of the order of 50 nT. But the observations made onboard FAST show that the
SKAW’s are mainly observed in the cusp and the polar cap boundary layer,
while the cavities are observed in the lower latitude auroral region where the
magnetic ﬂuctuations ∆B do not exceed 5 nT. It is possible that the cavities
are built in the polar cap boundary layer by SKAWs, they subsist after
the disapearance of the Alfv´enic perturbations and ﬁnally they are gently
convected to lower latitudes by the large scale convection electric ﬁeld. This
suppose of course the stability of the auroral cavities. An other scenario is
that the cavities are created through Field Line Resonance (FLR) [19] directly
in the auroral region. The ∆B
5 nT (on a time scale that corresponds to
the crossing of a cavity by a spacecraft) associated to the FLR is compatible
with the value shown in Fig. 6. The equilibria shown in Fig. 6 may be a
relevant short scale Vlasov-Maxwell description of the part of the FLR that
is in the high altitude auroral zone (the FLR has been modeled on a global
scale in the multiﬂuid approximation up to now).

IV. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DEVLOPP-
MENTS

This paper presents a large class of monodimensional analytic kinetic equi-
libria. They are based on particle distribution functions Eq. (5) that depend
on a set of almost arbitrary functions. These distribution functions are so-
lutions of the Vlasov equation, and the vector potential can be computed

14

through the evaluation of the integral function given in Eq. (35). In some
particular cases, like the uniform plasma and the Harris current sheet, this
integral is a combination of elementary mathematical functions. In the other
cases, its numerical evaluation is straightforward.

Unlike most of the kinetic tangential equilibria given in the litterature, the
freedom in the choice of the density proﬁle, altough more diﬃcult to control,
is almost as large as with bi-ﬂuid models. The kinetic equilibria have the
great advantage of giving a complete description of the distribution function
(not provided with the ﬂuid theory), and can describe equilibria where strong
gradients develop on the scale of a few ion Larmor radii. These solutions
can be used as initial conditions in particle in cell and Vlasov numerical
simulations.

Most of the authors who build models and are cited in this paper have
based their elementary solutions on distribution functions that depend on the
invariants of the motion. Some of them combined a small number of such
elementary solutions and asserted that each of these elementary solutions
correspond to a family of trapped particles. The distribution function given
in Eq. (5) is the superposition, not of a ﬁnite number, but of a continuum
of families of trapped particles. This is why we have a very large degree of
freedom in the choice of the density and temperature proﬁles. For the ﬁrst
time, we show that such a supperposition of families of trapped particles lead
to an analytically integrable equation, whose solution is given in Eq. (35)

The equilibria discussed in section III.B where the plasma is uniform for
x
can be compared to the solutions of the jump equations developed in
the frame of the MHD theory. The equilibria developed in the present paper
are characterized by jumps of the density and of the magnetic ﬁeld, the
normal velocity is null as well as the normal magnetic ﬁeld. They therefore
belong to the family of tangential discontinuities. But they concern only a
sub-category: the magnetic ﬁeld direction is uniform and the solutions have
no velocity shear: the velocities are equal to zero at x
,
∞
even if they can take other values at ﬁnite distances. These restrictions are
not required for general tangential discontinuities.

Building a kinetic model, inspired from the present results, of a tangential
discontinuity where the magnetic ﬁeld can turn is straighforward and will be
presented in a forthcomming paper in order to analyse experimental data
provided by the Cluster satellites.

ne

The examples given in the present paper come from the magnetospheric
and solar wind physics because these media oﬀers the opportunity of in situ
observations of non collisional astrophysical plasmas. Tangential equilibria
can be used to describe the magnetopause (present around all the magnetized
planets with an atmosphere), the distant neutral sheet, the Earth auroral
cavities, and some density ﬂuctuations of the solar wind [20].

But tangential equilibria do not exist only in the terrestrial environnment.
They exist whenever plasmas with diﬀerent origins and velocities meet. Such
situations exist in many astrophysical plasmas. Theoretical models (based
on MHD and plasma multiﬂuid theories) of the boundary of the Heliosphere
show that it is constituted of a termination shock, followed by the heliopause,
that is a tangential discontinuity, an hydrogen wall, and possibly an helio-
spheric shock [21]. Tangential discontinuities also exist around other stars.
M¨uller et al. [22] studied the interaction of the very active binary star λ An-
dromedae, and of the neaby star ǫ Indi with the interstellar medium. They
found, as in the case of the heliopause, the existence of four boundaries, one
of them, the asteropause being a tangential discontinuity.
It is clear that
tangential layers exist in other astrophysical plasmas where they may play
a very important role, as frontiers, or in acceleration, heating and radiative
processes.

The studies of the magnetospheric plasmas have shown that most of the
heating and acceleration phenomena can be only explained through kinetic
processes. So far, most of the remote astrophysical plasmas have been stud-
ied through MHD or multiﬂuid theories. The understanding of acceleration
processes in remote astrophysical plasma might as well require kinetic mod-
els. The equilibria presented in this paper might be a good start for some of
those studies.

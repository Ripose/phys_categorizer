Theoretical and numerical studies are presented of the amplitude modulation of electron-acoustic
waves (EAWs) propagating in space plasmas whose constituents are inertial cold electrons, Boltz-
mann distributed hot electrons and stationary ions. Perturbations oblique to the carrier EAW prop-
agation direction have been considered. The stability analysis, based on a nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation (NLSE), reveals that the EAW may become unstable; the stability criteria depend on
the angle θ between the modulation and propagation directions. Diﬀerent types of localized EA
excitations are shown to exist.

INTRODUCTION

Electron acoustic waves (EAWs) are high-frequency (in
comparison with the ion plasma frequency) electrostatic
modes [1] in plasmas where a ‘minority’ of inertial cold
electrons oscillate against a dominant thermalized back-
ground of inertialess hot electrons providing the neces-
sary restoring force. The phase speed vph of the EAW
is much larger than the thermal speeds of cold elec-
trons (vth,c) and ions (vth,i), but is much smaller than
the thermal speed of the hot electron component (vth,h);
vth,α = (Tα/mα)1/2, where α = c, h, i (mα denotes the
mass of the component α; the Boltzmann constant kB is
understood to precede the temperature Tα everywhere).
Thus, the ions may be regarded as a constant positive
charge density background, providing charge neutrality.
The EAW frequency is typically well below the cold elec-
tron plasma frequency, since the wavelength is larger
than the Debye length λh = (Th/4πnh0e2)1/2 involving
hot electrons (nα denotes the particle density of the com-
ponent α everywhere).

The linear properties of the EA waves are well under-
stood [2–5]. Of particular importance is the fact that
the EAW propagation is only possible within a restricted
range of the parameter values, since both long and short
wavelength EAWs are subject to strong Landau damp-
ing due to resonance with either the hot or the cold (re-

As far as the nonlinear aspects of EAW are concerned,
the formation of coherent EA structures has been con-
sidered in a one-dimensional model involving cold [6, 7]
or ﬁnite temperature [8] ions. Furthermore, such non-
envelope solitary structures, associated with a localized
compression of the cold electron density, have been shown
to exist in a magnetized plasma [9 – 11].
It is worth
noting that such studies are recently encouraged by the
observation of moving EAW-related structures, reported
by spacecraft missions e.g. the FAST at the auroral re-
gion [12 – 14], as well as the GEOTAIL and POLAR
earlier missions in the magnetosphere [15 – 17]. How-
ever, although most solitary wave structures observed are
positive potential waves (consistent with an electron hole
image), there have also been some negative potential and
low velocity structure observations, suggesting that some
other type of solitary waves may be present in the mag-
netosphere [17, 18]. These structures are now believed
to be related to EA envelope solitary waves, for instance
due to trapping and modulation by ion acoustic density
perturbations [6, 18].

Amplitude modulation is a long-known generic feature
of nonlinear wave propagation, resulting in higher har-
monic generation due to nonlinear self-interactions of the
carrier wave in the background medium. The standard
method for studying this mechanism is a multiple space
and time scale technique [19, 20], which leads to a non-
linear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE) describing the evo-
lution of the wave envelope. Under certain conditions,
it has been shown that waves may develop a Benjamin-

Feir-type (modulational) instability (MI), i.e. their mod-
ulated envelope may be unstable to external perturba-
tions. Furthermore, the NLSE-based analysis, encoun-
tered in a variety of physical systems [21 – 23], reveals
the possibility of the existence of localized structures (en-
velope solitary waves) due to the balance between the
wave dispersion and nonlinearities. This approach has
long been considered with respect to electrostatic plasma
waves [20, 24 – 30].

−

In this paper, we study the occurrence of modulational
instability as well as the existence of envelope solitary
structures involving EAWs that propagate in an unmag-
netized plasma composed of three distinct particle popu-
lations: a population of ‘cold’ inertial electrons (mass me,
charge
e), surrounded by an environment of ‘hot’ (ther-
malized Boltzmann) electrons, moving against a ﬁxed
background of ions (mass mi, charge qi = +Zie), which
provide charge neutrality. These three plasma species
will henceforth be denoted by c, h and i, respectively.
By employing the reductive perturbation method and ac-
counting for harmonic generation nonlinearities, we de-
rive a cubic Schr¨odinger equation for the modulated EA
wave packet.
It is found that the EAWs are unstable
against oblique modulations. Conditions under which
the modulational instability occurs are given. Possible
stationary solutions of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion are also presented.

Let us consider the hydrodynamic–Poisson system of
equations for the EAWs in an unmagnetized plasma. The
number density nc of cold electrons is governed by the

We assume immobile ions (ni = ni,0 = constant) and a

much higher than the ion plasma frequency, and the EA
wave phase velocity is much lower than the electron ther-
mal speed (Th/me)1/2. The overall quasi-neutrality con-

as well as a non-vanishing contribution S(2)
to the ﬁrst

We observe that only the ﬁrst contribution Q0, related
to self-interaction due to the zeroth harmonics, is angle-
dependent, while the latter two - respectively due to the
cubic and quadratic terms in (5c) - are isotropic. Also,
Q2 is negative, while Q0, Q1 are positive for all values
of k and β. For parallel modulation, i.e. θ = 0, the
|θ=0 are readily
simpliﬁed expressions for P
|θ=0 and Q
obtained from the above formulae; note that P
|θ=0 < 0,
while Q
0 (see below),
|θ=0, even though positive for k
changes sign at some critical value of k.

→

A preliminary result regarding the behaviour of the co-
eﬃcients P and Q for long wavelengths may be obtained
1 in the above
by considering the limit of small k
formulae. The parallel (θ = 0) and oblique (θ
= 0) mod-
ulation cases have to be distinguished straightaway. For
small values of k (k

1), P is negative and varies as

≪

in the parallel modulation case (i.e. θ = 0), thus tending
to zero for vanishing k, while for θ
= 0, P is positive and

In conclusion, both P and Q change sign when ‘switch-
ing on’ theta. Since the wave’s (linear) stability proﬁle,
expected to be inﬂuence by obliqueness in modulation,
essentially relies on (the sign of) the product P Q (see
below), we see that long wavelengths will always be sta-
ble.

V. STABILITY ANALYSIS

The standard stability analysis [20, 21, 31] consists in
linearizing around the monochromatic (Stokes’s wave) so-
lution of the NLSE (15): ψ = ˆψ eiQ
τ + c.c. , (notice
|
the amplitude dependence of the frequency) by setting
ˆψ = ˆψ0 + ǫ ˆψ1 , and taking the perturbation ˆψ1 to be
of the form: ˆψ1 = ˆψ1,0 ei(ˆkζ
ˆωτ ) + c.c. (the perturba-
tion wavenumber ˆk and the frequency ˆω should be dis-
tinguished from their carrier wave homologue quantities,

for positive P Q > 0,

The wave will obviously be stable if the product P Q

In ﬁgures 1 to 3, we have depicted the P Q = 0 bound-
ary curve against the normalized wavenumber k/kD (in
abscissa) and angle θ (between 0 and π); the area in black
θ) plane where
(white) represents the region in the (k
the product is negative (positive), i.e. where the wave
is stable (unstable). For illustration purposes, we have
considered w a wide range of values of the wavenumber
k (normalized by the Debye wavenumber kD,h; neverthe-
less, recall that the analysis is rigorously valid in a quite
restricted region of (low) values of k. Modulation angle θ
is allowed to vary between zero and π (see that all plots
are π

−

2 - periodic).

≈

As analytically predicted above, the product P Q is
negative for small k, for all values of theta; long wave-
lengths will always be stable. The product possesses pos-
1 rad
itive values for angle values between zero and θ
57◦; instability sets in above a wavenumber thresh-
≈
old which, even though unrealistically high for θ = 0, is
clearly seen to decrease as the modulation pitch angle
θ increases from zero to approximately 30 degrees, and
then increases again up to θ
57◦. Nevertheless, beyond
≈
that value (and up to π/2) the wave remains stable; this
is even true for the wavenumber regions where the wave
would be unstable to a parallel modulation. The inverse
eﬀect is also present: even though certain k values corre-
spond to stability for θ = 0, the same modes may become
unstable when subject to an oblique modulation (θ
= 0).
In all cases, the wave appears to be globally stable to
large angle θ modulation (between 1 and π/2 radians,
i.e. 57◦ to 90◦).

It is interesting to trace the inﬂuence of the percentage
of the cold electron population (related to β = nc/nh) on
the qualitative remarks of the preceding paragraph. For
values of β below unity, there seems to be only a small
eﬀect on the wave’s stability, as described above; cf. ﬁgs.
1, 2. As a matter of fact, β < 1 appears to be valid in
most reports of satellite observations, carried out at the
edges of the Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) region

(where the hot and cold electron population co-existence
is observed) [9, 12, 14]; furthermore, theoretical studies
have suggested that a low β value (in addition to a high
hot to cold electron temperature ratio) are conditions
ensuring EAW stability i.e. resistance to damping [4, 9].
Nevertheless, notice for rigor that allowing for a high frac-
tion of cold electrons (β >
3.5) leads to a strong modi-
∼
ﬁcation of the the EA wave’s stability proﬁle, and even
produces instability in otherwise stable regions; cf. ﬁg.
3 (where an unrealistic value of β = 5 was considered).
In a qualitative manner, adding cold electrons seems to
favour stability to quasi-parallel modulation (small θ),
yet allows for instability to higher θ oblique modulation;
cf. ﬁgs. 1 to 3. Since the black/white regions in the ﬁg-
ures correspond to dark/bright type solitons (see below),
we qualitatively deduce that a solitary wave of either type
may become unstable in case of an important increase in
minority electron component, i.e. well above β = 1; see
ﬁg. 5. Notice that the critical value of the cold-to-hot
electron number ratio β in order for such phenomena to
occur may be quite low if oblique modulation is consid-
ered; see e.g. ﬁg. 5b.

VI. ENVELOPE SOLITARY WAVES

The NLSE (15) is known to possess distinct types of
localized constant proﬁle (solitary wave) solutions, de-
pending on the sign of the product P Q. Following Ref.
[31, 32], we seek a solution of Eq.
(15) in the form
ρ(ζ, τ ) ei Θ(ζ,τ ), where ρ, σ are real variables
ψ(ζ, τ ) =
which are determined by substituting into the NLSE and
separating real and imaginary parts. The diﬀerent types
of solution thus obtained are summarized in the follow-
ing.

Summarizing, we see that the regions depicted in ﬁgs.
1 – 3 actually also distinguish the regions where diﬀerent
types of localized solutions may exist: bright (dark or
grey) solitons will occur in white (black) regions (the dif-
ferent types of NLS excitations are exhaustively reviewed
in [32]). Soliton characteristics will depend on dispersion
and nonlinearity via the P and Q coeﬃcients; in particu-
lar, the sign/absolute value of the ratio P/Q provides,
as we saw, the type (bright or dark-grey)/width, re-
spectively, of the localized excitation. Therefore, regions
will support wider (spatially
with higher values of
|
more extended) localized excitations of either bright or
dark/grey type - see ﬁg. 4. Solitons of the latter type
(holes) appear to be predominant in the long wavelength

region which is of interest here, in agreement with obser-
vations, yet may become unstable and give their place to
(bright) pulses, in the presence of oblique perturbation
(ﬁgs. 1, 2) and/or local nc/nh- value irregularities (ﬁg.
5). In the short wavelength region, these qualitative re-
sults may still be valid, yet quantitatively appear to be
rather questionable, since the wave stability cannot be
taken for granted due to electron Landau damping. Nev-
ertheless, even so, the EAWs are known to be less heavily
damped than Langmuir waves [4], and may dominate the
space plasma (high) frequency spectrum in the presence
of diﬀerent temperature electron populations.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

This work has been devoted to the study of the modu-
lation of EAWs propagating in an unmagnetized space
plasma. Allowing for the modulation to occur in an
oblique manner, we have shown that the conditions for
the modulational instability depend on the angle between
the EAW propagation and modulation directions.
In
fact, the region of parameter values where instability oc-
curs is rather extended for angle θ values up to a certain
threshold, and, on the contrary, smeared out for higher
θ values (and up to 90 degrees, then going on in a π
2 -
periodic fashion).

Furthermore, we have studied the possibility for the
formation of localized structures (envelope EAW solitary
waves) in our two electron system. Distinct types of lo-
calized excitations (envelope solitons) have been shown
to exist. Their type and propagation characteristics de-
pend on the carrier wave wavenumber k and the mod-

6

ulation angle θ. The dominant localized mode at long
wavelengths appears to be a rarefactive region of negative
wave intensity (hole), which may however become unsta-
ble to oblique modulation or variations of the nc/nh ratio.
It should be mentioned that both bright and dark/grey
envelope excitations are possible within this model; thus,
even though the latter appear to be rather privileged
within the parameter range where waves are expected
not to be heavily damped, the former may exist due
to oblique amplitude perturbations.
In conclusion, we
stress that the qualitative aspects of the observed en-
velope solitary structures are recovered from our simple
ﬂuid model. The present investigation can be readily ex-
tended to include the eﬀects of the geomagnetic ﬁeld, a
tenuous electron beam, and on dynamics on the ampli-
tude modulation of the EAWs. The magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects
would produce three-dimensional NLSE in which the lon-
gitudinal and transverse (to the external magnetic ﬁeld
direction) group dispersions would be diﬀerent due to the
cold electron polarization eﬀect. The harmonic genera-
tion nonlinearities would also be modiﬁed by the presence
of the external magnetic ﬁeld.

Figure 1.
The product P Q = 0 contour is depicted against the
normalized wavenumber k/kD (in abscissa) and angle θ
(between 0 and π); black (white) colour represents the
region where the product is negative (positive), i.e. the
region of linear stability (instability). Furthermore, black
(white) regions may support dark (bright)-type solitary
excitations. This plot refers to a realistic cold to hot
electron ratio equal to β = 0.5 (i.e. one third of the
electrons are cold).

Figure 2.
Similar to ﬁg. 1, for β = 1.

Figure 3.
Similar to ﬁgures 1, 2 considering a very strong pres-
ence of cold electrons (β = 5). Notice the appearance
of instability (bright) regions for large angle values and
long wavelengths.

Figure 4.
Contours of the ratio P/Q – whose absolute value is
related to the square of the soliton width, see (27), (29)
– are represented against the normalized wavenumber
k/kD,h and angle θ. See that the negative values cor-
respond to two branches (lower half), so that the varia-
tion of P/Q, for a given wavenumber k, does not depend
monotonically on θ. β = 0.5 in this plot.

Figure 5.
The P/Q coeﬃcient ratio, whose sign/absolute value
is related to the type/width of solitary excitations, is de-
picted against the cold-to-hot electron density ratio β.
The wavenumber is chosen as k/kD,h = 0.7. (a) θ = 0◦
(parallel modulation): only dark-type excitations exist
(P Q < 0); their width increases with β.
(b) θ = 60◦
(oblique modulation): bright/dark excitations exist for
0.8. The bright/dark soliton width
β below/above βcr ≈
increases/decreases with β. (c) θ = 90◦ (transverse mod-
ulation). A rather (unacceptably) high value of β was
taken, to stress the omnipresence of dark–type excita-
tions.

We study scaling in ﬂuctuations of the geomagnetic
indices (AE, AU , and AL) that provide a measure of
magnetospheric activity and of the ǫ parameter which is
a measure of the solar wind driver. Generalized structure
function (GSF) analysis shows that ﬂuctuations exhibit
self-similar scaling up to about 1 hour for the AU in-
dex and about 2 hours for AL, AE and ǫ when the most
extreme ﬂuctuations over 10 standard deviations are ex-
cluded. The scaling exponents of the GSF are found to be
similar for the three AE indices, and to diﬀer signiﬁcantly
from that of ǫ. This is corroborated by direct comparison
of their rescaled probability density functions.

1. Introduction

The statistical properties of ﬂuctuations in geomag-
netic indices and their relation to those in the solar
wind, is a topic of considerable interest (see, e.g., [Sitnov
et al., 2000; Tsurutani et al., 1990; Ukhorskiy et al., 2002;
V¨or¨os et al., 1998]). Scaling has been identiﬁed as a key
property of magnetospheric energy release in the form
of bursty bulk ﬂows in the magnetotail [Angelopoulos
et al., 1992], “blobs” in the aurora [Lui et al., 2000], non-
Gaussian ﬂuctuations in geomagnetic indices [Hnat et al.,
2002, 2003a; Consolini et al., 1996] and in single station
magnetometer data [Kov´acs et al., 2001; V¨or¨os et al.,
1998]. Models include Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)
[Chang et al., 2003] (see also the review [Chapman and
Watkins, 2001]) and multi-fractal models [Kov´acs et al.,
2001] related to those of turbulence[Consolini et al., 1996;
V¨or¨os et al., 1998].

These measures of scaling and non-Gaussian ﬂuctua-
tions in magnetospheric output need to be understood in
the context of the system’s driver, the solar wind, which is
turbulent and thus also scaling. Other work has focussed
on comparing properties of input parameters such as ǫ
and the indices (AE, AU and AL) to establish whether
they are directly related. However, these studies have not
provided a consistent answer. While Freeman et al. [2000]
found that both the ǫ and the AU and AL indices exhib-
ited nearly identical scaling of burst lifetime probability
density functions (PDFs), Uritsky et al. [2001] obtained
quite diﬀerent scalings for AE and the solar wind quan-
tity vxByz using spreading exponent methods motivated
by SOC. Hnat et al. [2002, 2003a] used a PDF rescaling
technique to characterize the ﬂuctuation PDF of 4 years

HNAT ET. AL: SCALING OF AE INDICES

ǫ data from WIND and a 1 year data set of AE indices
with ﬂuctuations over a few standard deviations. Direct
comparison of the PDF’s functional form suggested close
similarity to within statistical error.

In this paper we use a larger 10-year data set for the
AE indices to obtain a more accurate statistical determi-
nation of the functional form of the PDF of ﬂuctuations
over a more extensive dynamic range, including charac-
terization of extremal events up to 10 standard devia-
tions for the ﬁrst time. We apply structure functions to
characterize and compare both the low and higher order
moments for all quantities. A 4-year subset of the index
data, corresponding to the same period in the solar cy-
cle as that used to produce ǫ, is used to facilitate this
comparison. We then verify these results by direct ex-
amination of the ﬂuctuation PDF using the full 10-year
AE indices dataset.

2. Data Sets

The AL, AU and AE index data sets investigated
here comprise over 5.5 million, 1 minute averaged sam-
ples from January 1978 to December 1988 inclusive.
The ǫ data set is identical to that used in Hnat et al.
[2002, 2003a] and extends from January 1995 to Decem-
ber 1998 inclusive. It includes intervals of slow and fast
speed streams. ǫ is deﬁned (see [Hnat et al., 2002]) in
SI units as ǫ = v(B2/µ0)l2
0 sin4(Θ/2), where l0 ≈ 7RE
and Θ = arctan(|By|/Bz), and was calculated from the
WIND spacecraft key parameter database [Lepping et al.,
1995; Ogilvie et al., 1995]. The indices and ǫ are from
diﬀerent time intervals and here we assume statistical
stability over these long time intervals.

3. Generalized Structure Functions

Generalized structure functions (GSF), or generalized
variograms, can be deﬁned in terms of an average over
time of a diﬀerenced variable δx(t, τ ) = x(t + τ ) − x(t) as
Sm(τ ) =< |δx(t, τ )|m > [Rodr´iguez-Iturbe and Rinaldo,
1997]. If δx exhibits scaling with respect to τ , then Sm ∝
τ ζ(m). A log-log plot of Sm versus τ should then reveal a
straight line for each m with gradients ζ(m). If ζ(m) =
αm (α constant) then the time series is self-similar with
single scaling exponent α.

In order to compare the scaling properties of the non-
contemporaneous ǫ and AE indices time series, we select
a 4-year subinterval 1984 − 1987 from the AE indices at
the same phase in the solar cycle as the ǫ data. Fig-
ure 1 shows the second order GSFs as measured by the
standard deviations σ(τ ) = [S2(τ )]1/2 of the ﬂuctuation
δx(t, τ ). A scaling region is apparent between 27 and
212 s where σ(τ ) ∝ τ H, where H is the Hurst exponent
[ζ(2)/2]. The R2 goodness of ﬁt analysis was performed
to select the optimal power law region and gradient and
results are summarized in Table 1. The upper limits of
the scale regions τmax are in good agreement with val-
ues reported previously [Consolini and De Michelis, 1998;
Takalo et al., 1993; Takalo and Timonen, 1998].

Any such single estimate of the H, whilst establish-
ing the region of τ over which there is scaling, does not
fully characterize the properties of the time series. For
example, a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) can be con-
structed to share the same H value as AE, but the fBm
series has Gaussian distributed increments δx by deﬁni-
tion [Mandelbrot, 2002] whereas those of AE are non-
Gaussian [Consolini and De Michelis, 1998; Hnat et al.,

HNAT ET. AL: SCALING OF AE INDICES

X - 3

2002]. As discussed by Mandelbrot [2002] the similar val-
ues arise because H aggregates two sources of scaling in
monofractal random walks: persistence (the “Joseph” ef-
fect) and heavy tails in the increments (the “Noah” ef-
fect). In the above example the anomalous value of H
for fBm comes just from the Joseph eﬀect, whilst for AE
the Noah eﬀect must be at work. Furthermore, estimat-
ing H by only one method may not distinguish a fractal
time series from a discontinuous one [Watkins et al., 2001;
Katsev and L’Heureux, 2003]. We thus turn next to the
higher order m values of ζ(m).

Figure 2 shows scaling exponents ζ(m) derived from
raw GSFs with m varying between −1 and 8 for the δǫ
and AE indices ﬂuctuations. These suggest the depar-
ture of higher orders from self-similarity, i.e., ζ(m) de-
parts from a straight line. The inset of this ﬁgure shows
the origin of these ζ(m) values for δAU and m = 1, ..., 7.
Only the ﬁrst four orders exhibit clear linear behavior ex-
pected in the scaling region. For higher orders, the value
of ζ very strongly depends on the assumed extent of the
scaling region to which one ﬁts a straight line. In princi-
ple, ζ(m) can be obtained for any m. However, errors do
not contribute uniformly over m, for example, the largest
ﬂuctuations that aﬀect large m, are statistically poorly
resolved, whereas the smallest ﬂuctuations (δx → 0) are
dominated by instrument thresholds. For the latter rea-
son we will exclude m = −1 for δǫ as δǫ → 0 is not well
determined through its deﬁnition.

Conditioned GSFs quantify the impact of intermit-
tency on ﬂuctuations of diﬀerent sizes by imposing a
threshold A on the event size [Kov´acs et al., 2001]. Here,
this threshold will be based on the standard deviation of
the diﬀerenced time series for a given τ , A(τ ) = 10σ(τ ).
This procedure allows us to exclude rare extreme ﬂuctua-
tions with large statistical errors which, for large m, could
lead to a spurious departure from self-similar behavior.
Alternatively, conditioning with diﬀerent thresholds es-
timates a maximum size for the ﬂuctuations for which
self-similarity is still valid.

Following conditioning, log-log plots of Sc

m(τ ) show
good correspondence with straight line ﬁts, shown for
δAU in the inset of ﬁgure 3. This power law dependence
holds between times already obtained from the R2 anal-
ysis performed for σ(τ ). The main plot then shows ζ(m)
obtained from the conditioned Sc
m(τ ). All lines in the
ﬁgure were ﬁtted for moments between −1 (0 for ǫ) and
6 and then extended to the entire range of data. Scaling
exponents obtained from this technique were unchanged
for thresholds A(τ ) between 6σ and 12σ.

Firstly, our analysis suggests that the statistics of
the ﬂuctuations for all four quantities are self-similar for
times between 2 and ∼ 100 minutes and ﬂuctuations of
size δx ≤ 10σ(τ ). Secondly, the scaling exponent α in
ζ(m) = αm that characterize this self-similar behavior,
are identical within errors for ﬂuctuations in the AE in-
dices but diﬀerent to that in ǫ at the 1σ level.

4. Rescaling of Fluctuation PDFs

Scaling of the GSFs can be related to scaling properties
of the ﬂuctuation PDFs [Hnat et al., 2002, 2003a] using
the generic, model-independent rescaling method (e.g.
[Mantegna and Stanley, 1995; Hnat et al., 2003b]) based
on the rescaling of the PDFs P (δx, τ ) of δx(t, τ ) on diﬀer-
ent time scales τ . If a time series exhibits statistical self-
similarity, a single argument representation of the PDF
−α),
can be found that is given by P (δx, τ ) = τ

−αPs(δxτ

X - 4

where α is the rescaling exponent. We now express Sm
using the ﬂuctuations’ PDF, P (δx, τ ) as follows:

Sm(τ ) =

|δx|mP (δx, τ )d(δx).

(1)

∞

Z

−∞

Expressing the integral in (1) in terms of rescaled vari-
ables Ps and δxs = δxτ −α shows that the scaling ex-
ponent ζ(m) is a linear function of m, ζ(m) = mα, for
a statistically self-similar process, as suggested here by
ﬁgure 3.

The exponent α is ideally obtained from the scaling
of the peaks of the PDF P (0, τ ). However, the ﬁnite ac-
curacy of the measurement may discretize the amplitude
leading to errors in the peak values. Table 1 gives all
scaling exponents, obtained by diﬀerent methods. These
yield consistent values of α, to within the errors. We will
use α from the scaling of σ(τ ) versus τ .
If the ﬂuctu-
ations are statistically self-similar, as suggested by our
GSF analysis, then the unscaled PDFs P (δx, τ ) should
collapse onto a single curve Ps(δxs). We applied PDF
rescaling to the ﬂuctuation PDFs of all quantities and
obtained satisfactory collapse of the curves within the
scaling regions. The χ2 test applied to all quantities re-
vealed that, for the scaling regions given above, the col-
lapsed curves lie within 5 − 7% error band.

Figure 4 shows the re-scaled ﬂuctuation PDFs for the
indices alone for τ ≈ 15 min. The δx variable has been
normalized to the rescaled standard deviation σs(τ ≈
15min.) of Ps in each case to facilitate this comparison.
The inset of this ﬁgure shows the comparison for AU ,
AE and −AL ﬂuctuations and these PDFs are nearly
identical. These results are consistent with conclusions
of the GSF analysis at the 1σ level.

Figure 5 shows the normalized PDFs Ps(δxs) for δx =
δǫ, δAE and τ ≈ 15 min overlaid on a single plot. We
can clearly distinguish between the PDFs of the δǫ and
AE indices’ ﬂuctuations. We obtain the same result re-
peating this comparison for several values of τ , within the
scaling range τmax. We have also veriﬁed that the func-
tional form of the PDF are insensitive to the solar cycle
within errors. The use of a larger, 10 year data set for
the indices has reduced statistical scatter and expanded
the dynamic range of the considered ﬂuctuations as com-
pared to the analysis given in [Hnat et al., 2002, 2003a],
and would lead us to draw the opposite conclusion, that
on time scales less than ≈ 1 hour the AE index amplitude
ﬂuctuations are not driven linearly by those of the solar
wind. We would also conclude that the diﬀerence seen at
the 1σ level in the scaling of the ǫ and the indices is sig-
niﬁcant, even though they agree at the 2σ level [Freeman
et al., 2000].

5. Summary

In this paper we have addressed an open question of
the possible connection between the scaling properties of
ﬂuctuations in the solar wind driver and those observed in
global measures of magnetospheric dynamics. We applied
two statistical methods, generalized structure functions
and PDF rescaling, to study the scaling of ﬂuctuations
in the ǫ parameter and the magnetospheric indices AU ,
AL and AE. We ﬁnd that, statistically, ﬂuctuations in all
four quantities are approximately self-similar when their
size is limited to ∼ 10σ. This self-similarity extends to
∼ 1 − 1.5 hours. The scaling exponents of the AE indices
are close to each other and are appreciably diﬀerent to

HNAT ET. AL: SCALING OF AE INDICES

X - 5

that of the ǫ parameter.

The ﬂuctuation PDFs of the AE indices, unlike that
of δǫ, are asymmetric. Direct comparison of the PDFs
for the ﬂuctuations in the AU , AE and −AL index in-
dicates that they are nearly identical. Whilst the low
frequency behavior of the solar wind and the indices may
be well correlated [Tsurutani et al., 1990], here we have
concluded that, on time scales smaller than 1 hour the
properties of the ﬂuctuations in the solar wind and the
indices diﬀer in both amplitude and persistence.
If the
underlying physical origin of the auroral scaling is turbu-
lence, then diﬀerent scaling behavior implies a diﬀerent
type of turbulence, i.e., diﬀerent dimensionality/topology
or diﬀerent relevant physics [Frisch, 1995]. If the under-
lying physics is SOC or similar [Chang et al., 2003] then
[Uritsky
similar conclusions would still be drawn (c.f.
et al., 2001]). However, at this point we also can not
rule out the possibility that the way in which the in-
dices are constructed “burns” information still present
in the magnetometer data about the solar wind scaling,
here possibly by changing either or both of the degree of
persistence (power spectral slope) and the heavy-tailed
property (see [Edwards et al., 2001] for a related prelim-
inary investigation).

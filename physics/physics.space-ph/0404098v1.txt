Abstract

In this article we want to present the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) in some detail, as
well as some of the instruments of interest for ionospheric and magnetospheric research that
are located in the vicinity of it. We particularly describe how this instrument cluster, close to
the geomagnetic conjugate point of the Chinese Antarctic Zhongshan station, can contribute
to inter-hemispheric coordinated studies of the polar Ionosphere.

Keywords: EISCAT, Incoherent Scatter Radar, Conjugate studies

1 The Incoherent Scatter Technique

The use of incoherent scatter radars as a powerful ground-based diagnostic tool for studying the
near-Earth space environment began with the ﬁrst theoretical predictions by Gordon (1958), and
the ﬁrst observations by Bowles (1958) a few months later. There are several comprehensive
reviews of the Incoherent Scatter technique, (e.g. Evans, 1969, 1975; Bauer, 1975; Beynon and
Williams, 1978), while an overview of the early history of Incoherent Scatter, as well as an updated
description of the theory, instruments and signal processing involved can be found in (Farley, 1996).
The term Incoherent Scatter (IS) from an ionized gas refers to the extremely weak scatter from
ﬂuctuations in plasma density caused by the random thermal motion of the ions and electrons. Due
to the very low radar scattering cross section of an individual electron, only about 1.0 × 10−28 m2,
the total cross section of all the electrons in ten cubic kilometers — a typical volume probed in an
experiment — of the ionosphere with a maximum density of the order of 1012 m−3 is only about
10−6 m2. To detect signal from this weak source, we need a radar capable of detecting a coin at
300 km distance!

Incoherent Scatter Radars (ISR) therefore consist of large antennas, powerful transmitters,
and sensitive and sophisticated receiver systems, since in addition to measuring the signal and its
power we also need to measure the full Doppler power spectrum or equivalently the auto correlation
function (ACF) of the back-scattered signal.

When the radar frequency, ωradar is much higher than the plasma frequency ωp, the radar
wave travels almost unperturbed through the very dilute ionospheric plasma. A small fraction of
the wave energy is deposited into the acceleration of the electrons, which radiates back as small
dipoles. The ions also absorb energy in this process, but due to their relatively high mass, their
radar scattering cross section is a factor (me/mi)2 smaller than the electron radar scattering cross
section, and their contribution to the scattered signal is negligible.

In the pioneering work by Gordon, he assumed that one would see “true” incoherent scattering
from the individual free electrons. This would result in a back-scattered power spectrum with
a width proportional to the electron thermal velocity. The ﬁrst experiments, however, showed a
power spectrum with a width proportional to the ion thermal velocity, with the power contained in

a much narrower frequency range than predicted. This dramatically improved the signal to noise
ratio within this frequency range. Despite the fact that the electrons are the scattering particles
in this process, they are, due to their low mass, highly mobile and will therefore easily follow the
heavier ions through electromagnetic interactions. The typical scale size of these interactions is
called the Debye length. For a typical incoherent scatter radar conﬁguration, the radar wavelength
is much larger than the Debye length of the ionospheric plasma, and the power spectrum of
the received signal carries information about the plasma as a whole, with the electron dynamics
strongly inﬂuenced by the ions. For the situation with the radar wavelength shorter than the
Debye length, we have “true” incoherent scattering, and the electrons scatter as free particles,
with a received power spectrum typical for the electron velocity distribution function.

The scattered signal contains information about the plasma density, the electron and ion
temperatures, the ion composition, the bulk plasma motion, and various other parameters and
properties of the probed plasma.

A number of diﬀerent approaches all lead to the same result for the incoherent scatter power
spectral shape (Fejer, 1960; Dougherty and Farley, 1960; Salpeter, 1960; Rosenbluth and Rostoker,
1962; Rostoker, 1964; Trulsen and Bjørn˚a, 1975), and this back-scattered power spectrum can be
given by the equation:

and fα(v) the velocity distribution function for the species α.

Equation (1) gives rise to two parts of the power spectrum, the ion line (from the second term)
and the plasma line (from the ﬁrst term) respectively. The portions of the power spectrum with
small Doppler shifts is often referred to as the ion line. It can be viewed as two very broadened
overlapping lines corresponding to damped ion-acoustic waves traveling parallel and anti-parallel
to the k-vector determined by the radar system; toward and away from the radar for a mono-
static system. The lines have Doppler shifts corresponding to the frequency of ion-acoustic waves,
which are solutions of equation (1) in the low frequency range. From the ion-line we are able to
determine a range of plasma parameters:
The electron density, Ne can be found from the total back-scattered power. The constant of
proportionality between the electron density and the back-scattered power depends on the electron
and ion temperature (Te and Ti).
The temperature ratio, Te/Ti can be determined from the ratio of the peaks to the dip in the
ion spectra (shown in ﬁgure 1, panel 1) due to the Te/Ti dependence in the ion-acoustic damping
term.
The ion temperature to mass ratio, Ti/mi can be found from the width of the ion spectra.
If mi is known (e.g. from a model), Ti can be found, and hence Te.
Line-of-sight ion velocity can be determined from the Doppler shift of the ion spectra (shown
in ﬁgure 1, panel 2). By using a tristatic radar, the drift can be determined in three directions,
and hence the full ion velocity vector can be found.

The analysis is done by ﬁtting all parameters simultaneously in an iterative process. Behind
this ﬁtting routine, the most severe assumptions are the homogeneity and stationarity assumed

2

over the whole scattering volume and the whole integration time. For quiet conditions these
assumptions are suﬃciently fulﬁlled, but during active and disturbed periods, the returned power
is sometimes increased by one or two order of magnitude, the plasma is driven out of thermal
equilibrium, and the ion-line can be strongly asymmetric with one or both of the ion-acoustic
shoulder enhanced (Sedgemore-Schulthess and St.-Maurice, 2001, and references therein). During
these periods, the ﬁtting process does not work, since it assumes the plasma to be in thermal
equilibrium, and we are not able to determine the plasma parameters from the spectra. The
processes behind these “anomalous” ion spectra are not yet fully understood, and more work has
to be done in order to understand them, before we will be able to to analyse data also from these
periods.

For much higher frequencies, two narrow less damped lines, the plasma lines are found, one
up- and one down-shifted. They are high frequency solutions of equation (1). Their frequency
depends directly on the electron density, with a small correction from electron temperature, and
they can therefore be used to determine these plasma parameters when measured.

2 EISCAT and the ESR

EISCAT was founded by the six European countries France, Great Britain, Germany, Norway,
Finland and Sweden in 1975 for the purpose of constructing an ISR at high latitude; right un-
derneath the auroral zone. The EISCAT UHF radar — situated outside Tromsø, Norway — was
inaugurated in 1981. It is a tristatic system, the only one in operation in the world today, meaning
that in addition to the transmitter and receiver in Tromsø, there are passive receivers on two other
sites: Sodankyl¨a in Finland and Kiruna in Sweden. The three sites give the radar its unique ca-
pability of obtaining true vector velocities in a single common volume. The EISCAT VHF radar,
co-located with the UHF radar, became operational in 1985, and extended the capabilities of the
EISCAT system in the extreme low- and high-altitude regimes. The mainland EISCAT radars
were described in (Folkestad et al., 1983), but the UHF transmitters and all receiver systems have
since been totally redesigned, so this description is now out of date. A summary of the EISCAT
mainland radars’ capabilities as of the summer of 2001 is given in table 1.

The EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) was inaugurated in August 1996, the same year that
Japan became the seventh member of EISCAT. It is situated on top of Mine 7 on the Breinosa
mountain 12 km outside Longyearbyen, the biggest settlement in the Svalbard archipelago. The
ESR System is described in detail in (Wannberg et al., 1997). Since then, the transmitter has been
upgraded to 1 MW peak power, and a second antenna, 42 m in diameter and ﬁxed to point along
the geomagnetic ﬁeld, has been added. A summary of the ESR parameters is given in table 2.

The EISCAT mainland radars situated in the Auroral zone and the ESR in the vicinity of
the Cusp and Polar Cap boundary, constitute an ideal system for the exploration of the Arctic
Ionosphere. The ESR is the world’s most modern IS radar, with capabilities matching or exceeding
all others. Although some other radars can boast larger antennas or more powerful transmitters,
and hence higher sensitivity, the ESR with its TV-type transmitter is capable of higher duty cycle
than any other IS radar, which helps to make up for a smaller instrument. The modern receiver
system has a ﬂexibility and programmability which gives users a large number of options when it
comes to creating their own experiments. This is particularly true of the new hardware upgrade of
the mainland radars, which will soon be installed on Svalbard as well. The experiment catalogue
for the radars contain experiments which cover the entire Ionosphere from 70 to > 1200 km, with
new experiments under development.

Despite most radar scientists’ discussion of the (power) spectra of the incoherent scattering,
the quantity actually measured (or estimated) by the radar is its Fourier transform equivalent,
the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the scattering through lagged products of samples of the
scattered signal. The EISCAT radars, instead of forming ACF estimates from each of a given
number of ranges (called gates), sum and store all such lagged products in a lag proﬁle matrix.
Any suﬃciently advanced analysis can then use the information from all lagged products that
contribute to the scattering from a given range to infer the macroscopic plasma parameters at

this range. When such analysis is done on an entire ionospheric proﬁle at once, this is called full
proﬁle analysis (Holt et al., 1992). Although full proﬁle analysis has been demonstrated (Holt
et al., 1992; Lehtinen et al., 1996), it is not yet in common use for IS radar data.

The spectra that are presented in the following section are formed from the lag proﬁle matrix
by summing lagged products in such a way that the regions contributing to the measurement are
roughly equivalent for the diﬀerent lags of the autocorrelation function, thus producing a spectrum
from a fairly well-deﬁned and limited region of space.

2.1 Examples of observations

The mainland EISCAT radars were situated in a valley in order to eliminate the problem of
unwanted scattering from the ground, so-called ground clutter. The close-in mountains scatter
only at such short ranges that the receiver has not yet been opened, while shielding any solid
scatterers at longer ranges. With its location on a mountain, the ESR has no such shielding and,
for its ﬁrst few years of operation, the problem of eliminating ground clutter restricted the lower
range of its observations to approximately 150 km beyond the range of the farthest mountain
visible from the site. During this period, an experiment consisting of four long pulses (uncoded)
called gup0 was used almost exclusively.

With the solution of the ground clutter problem (Turunen et al., 2000), a new experiment
called gup3 was introduced as the standard experiment in 1999. This experiment combines long
pulses and alternating codes (Lehtinen and H¨aggstr¨om, 1987), with the alternating codes covering
the E and lower F regions, and the long pulses extending coverage into the topside Ionosphere.

More recently, an experiment called tau0, using alternating codes exclusively, has been adopted
as the standard experiment at the ESR. This experiment provides coverage from 90 to 1100 km, and
is typically used with 6.4 s time resolution, although 12.8 and 3.2 s have been used on occasion. In
ﬁgure 2, we show a typical example of tau0 spectra at F -region altitudes, using 3.7 min integration.
We observe how the width of the spectra increase with altitude, indicating higher ion temperatures,
and how the scattering power decreases, indicating lower electron densities.

2.2 Analysed data

As discussed above, we can infer a number of macroscopic plasma parameters from the power
spectrum or ACF of the scattering. This process is called the analysis of the (raw) data, and the
result is called analysed data. The program used for analysis of EISCAT data is called GUISDAP,
or Grand Uniﬁed Incoherent Scatter Design and Analysis Program (Lehtinen and Huuskonen,
1996).

In colour plate 1, we have plotted 96 hours of an 18-day continuous experiment conducted on
February 5.–23., 2001. This experiment illustrates the reliability of the radar and its capability
of obtaining long time series observations.
In the plate, we can see how the electron density
and temperature decreases during nighttime, and the extreme variability of the polar ionosphere.
Such data are available from the online analysed data archive at www.eiscat.uit.no, through
the MADRIGAL database.

3 Other instrumentation on Svalbard

The excellent facilities of the ESR are further strengthened by a number of instruments located
in the immediate vicinity of the ESR or with overlapping ﬁelds of view. Also mentioned here are
instruments in the vicinity of the magnetic conjugate point of the ESR.

The University of Tromsø owns an optical aurora station operated by the University courses on
Svalbard (UNIS) in Adventdalen, outside Longyearbyen, and many universities and institutions
around the world have their instruments at the station. In particular the Optics Group at the Geo-
physical Institute, University of Alaska contribute both with instruments and ﬁnances. Amongst
the instruments hosted at the station are various all-sky cameras, a Meridian Scanning Photometer

and magnetometers. Sigernes et al. (2002). Correspondingly, the Zhongshan station is equipped
with all-sky TV cameras (e.g. Hu Hongqiao et al., 1999),

In 1995, an 8 × 8 beam Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) was installed in
Adventdalen, close to the auroral station, with contributions from the Danish Meteorological
Institute (DMI), the National Institute of Polar Research of Japan (NIPR), UNIS of Longyearbyen
and the University of Tromsø. Equivalent instruments are also installed at the South Pole station,
at the Antarctic Syowa and Zongshan stations, at Equaliut in Canada, Søndre Strømfjord and
Danmarkshavn on Greenland, Tjørnes on Iceland, Kilpisj¨arvi in Finland and outside Ny-˚Alesund
on Svalbard (Stauning, 1998). The riometer measures the absorption of cosmic radiation, an
absorption usually caused by energetic precipitation penetrating to the lower Ionosphere. The
instrument has 64 antennas which are used to form 64 beams covering an area of 240 × 240 km at
90 km altitude, and the instrument obtains a full image every second. A closer description of the
instrument and its operations is given in (Detrick and Rosenberg, 1990).

The SOUSY HF radar is situated at the foot of the mountain of the ESR. It is a phased-array
system using 356 Yagi antennas with a 4◦ wide beam at the zenith, or 5◦ zenith angle in either of
the NE, NW, SE or SW directions, and an operating frequency of 53.5 MHz (R¨ottger, 2000). Being
an MST radar, it is suited for observations of the stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere, and
in particular Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes (PMSE)

Svalbard is also covered by the CUTLASS pair of the Arctic Dual Auroral Radar Network
(SuperDARN). The Arctic SuperDARN network covers most of the Auroral zone (except Siberia),
and provides good wide-area convection pattern coverage around Svalbard (Greenwald et al.,
1995). In the Antarctic, another network of SuperDARN radars is under development, with the
Eastward ﬁeld of view of the Syowa station covering the area around the Zhongshan and Davis
stations (Ogawa, 1996).

The University of Leicester, UK, operated an ionosonde in Longyearbyen until recently. The
instrument is not operational at the moment, but it will be moved to the SPEAR (described
below) site for reactivation shortly.

In addition, a heating facility called Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar (SPEAR) is
under construction beside the ESR (Wright et al., 2000). Like the heating facility outside Tromsø,
this facility can be used for ionospheric modiﬁcation experiments, induced plasma lines, and to
produce E-region irregularities which will act as scatterers for the SuperDARN HF radars.

Ny ˚Alesund, ≈ 150 km Northwest (magnetically almost North) of Longyearbyen is a busy
research community, and in addition to the instruments already mentioned, it hosts a rocket
launching facility (SvalRak) which is used for the launch of ionospheric research rockets; since
the launch site is at 79◦ North it is ideally located for scientiﬁc exploration of the dayside aurora
and processes in the magnetospheric boundary layer (Maynard et al., 2000). The Alfred Wegener
Institute for Polar and Marine Research operates a multiwavelength Lidar facility at Ny ˚Alesund,
which monitors mainly the middle atmosphere, but which can link temperature measurements
from the ionosphere with those from the neutral atmosphere at the mesopause (Neuber et al.,
1998).

4 The University Courses on Svalbard (UNIS)

The four Universities of Norway have cooperated to establish the University courses on Svalbard,
oﬀering courses and degrees to students from all of the world in four areas: Arctic Biology, Arctic
Geology, Arctic Geophysics and Arctic Technology. Each year, 100 students are admitted to the
undergraduate programmes, and 35 diﬀerent courses are given. The programme in Arctic Geo-
physics includes a course on the upper polar atmosphere, and the instruments at the Adventdalen
station and the EISCAT Svalbard Radar is used in this course.

5 Conjugate studies

By magnetically conjugate, we usually mean two points of the Earth’s ionosphere that are con-
nected by a magnetic ﬁeld line. At the magnetic latitude of Longyearbyen (≈ 75◦N), the ﬁeld
lines will usually be open to the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) or close far back in the geo-
magnetic tail. For open ﬁeld lines, conjugate points are usually taken to be points that would be
connected by a ﬁeld line in the absence of the IMF. In either case, no conjugacy through direct
linkage along magnetic ﬁeld lines should be expected at such high latitudes. Rather, coordinated
inter-hemispheric studies should be used to explore the extent to which magnetospheric symmetry
is maintained or breaks down during substorms and auroral displays. Asymmetries between the
nighttime and daytime ionosphere can also be investigated.

An early systematic conjugate study of visual aurora was a comparison of all-sky camera images
from Alaska and the Antarctica at L ≈ 4 (DeWitt, 1962). Later, a comparison of all-sky camera
images from the Antarctic Syowa station and Reykjavik was made, concluding that the situation
was less clear at this higher latitude L ≈ 6 than at the lower latitude (Wescott, 1966). The
famous conjugate ﬂights carried out between 1967 and 1974 (Belon et al., 1969; Stenbaek-Nielsen
et al., 1972, 1973) resulted in excellent night-time conjugate auroral all-sky images on a number
of occations, results which are further discussed in (Stenbaek-Nielsen and Otto, 1997).

Riometers have also been used extensively to study conjugate phenomena.

Initially, single
wide-beam riometers were used (e.g. Leinbach and Basler, 1963; Eriksen et al., 1964), while more
recent studies have used riometers with multiple narrow beams (e.g. Lambert et al., 1992), which
enables the derivation of velocity vectors for the motion of absorption regions. Lately, a series
of imaging riometers have been established in the Southern and Northern auroral zones (Nishino
et al., 1999), and conjugate observations combining imaging riometers and TV cameras have been
reported (Yamagishi et al., 1998).

As the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is perturbed by external inﬂuences, the point magnetically con-
jugate to any given location moves around. For the Antarctic Zhongshan station, the conjugate
point usually lies to the West of Svalbard, towards Greenland.
(Yamagishi et al., 1998). For
phenomena with larger footprints, like magnetic ﬁeld disturbances measured on the ground, it it
more appropriate to talk of a conjugate region. Conjugate studies should therefore always employ
instruments with a wide ﬁeld of view (all-sky cameras, imaging riometers, scanning photometers)
or instruments which measure extended phenomena (e.g. magnetometers). Satellite instruments
can also help through large-scale imaging of auroral forms and in-situ measurements of particle
ﬂuxes and magnetic ﬁeld vectors. Incoherent scatter radars measure in only one direction at a
time, but they supply information on the physical parameters as a function of range along this
direction, instead of the integrated quantities available through most of the other instruments
discussed here. This can provide details on the entire energy spectrum of precipitating particles
otherwise unattainable from the ground. With real-time determination of conjugacy from opti-
cal or imaging riometer observations, the radar can be pointed in the direction of the conjugate
region for pinpointed observations. ISR is also capable of operating during daylight or overcast
conditions (unlike optical instruments), and of providing continuous coverage over long periods
of time (unlike satellite-borne instruments and rockets). The extensive and detailed information
derived from the incoherent scatter technique, coupled with the coherent radar and optical data
available on Svalbard represents a large untapped opportunity for eﬀective conjugate studies in co-
operation with Chinese scientists to further investigate detailed diﬀerences between the Northern
and Southern Polar regions.

6 Conclusion

We have described in some detail the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) and some of the instruments
located in its vicinity. Through a review of previous conjugate studies, we have shown how this
capable instrument and the instrument cluster can contribute to interhemispheric coordinated
observations.

To date, the ESR has not participated in any conjugate point studies but extensive datasets

are already available and dedicated observation programs can be scheduled in the future.

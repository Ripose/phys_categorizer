Abstract

The evolution of magnetospheric indices on temporal scales shorter than that of substorms is char-
acterized by bursty, intermittent events that may arise from turbulence intrinsic to the magnetosphere
or may reﬂect solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. This leads to a generic problem of distinguishing be-
tween the features of the system and those of the driver. We quantify scaling properties of short term (up
to few hours) ﬂuctuations in the geomagnetic indices AL and AU during solar minimum and maximum
along with the parameter ǫ that is a measure of the solar wind driver. We ﬁnd that self-similar statistics
provide a good approximation for the observed scaling properties of ﬂuctuations in the geomagnetic in-
dices, regardless of the solar activity level, and in the ǫ parameter at solar maximum. This self-similarity
persists for ﬂuctuations on time scales at least up to about 1 − 2 hours. The scaling exponent of AU
index ﬂuctuations show dependence on the solar cycle and the trend follows that found in the scaling
of ﬂuctuations in ǫ. The values of their corresponding scaling exponents, however, are always distinct.
Fluctuations in the AL index are insensitive to the solar cycle as well as being distinct from those in
the ǫ parameter. This approximate self-similar scaling leads to a Fokker-Planck model which, we show,
captures the probability density function of ﬂuctuations and provides a stochastic dynamical equation
(Langevin equation) for time series of the geomagnetic indices.

Introduction

The Earth’s magnetosphere can be considered as non-linear, dissipative system which is driven by the
time varying solar wind. Accumulated energy is ultimately dissipated, at least in part, through a system
of currents generated in the auroral zones of the ionosphere. These currents produce small changes in
the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld which can be used to monitor magnetospheric activity. The complex be-
havior of the magnetosphere, as suggested by many observations (see, for example, [Horton et al.(1999),
Lewis(1991), Sitnov et al.(2000), Takalo et al.(2000), Vassiliadis et al.(2000), V¨or¨os et al.(2002)]), could
then be attributed either to intrinsic magnetospheric processes, the complex nature of its coupling with
the solar wind and the ionosphere or both.

Recent observations suggest that the multi-scale nature of this coupling is a fundamental aspect of mag-
netospheric dynamics (see, for example [Chang(1992), Chapman and Watkins(2001), Klimas et al.(1996),
Ukhorskiy et al.(2003), Vassiliadis et al.(2003), Weigel et al.(2003)]). Evidence is provided by a variety of
observations which exhibit statistical properties previously identiﬁed as hallmarks of multi-scale systems.
For example, bursty transport events have been reported in the magnetotail[Angelopoulos et al.(1992)] and
their auroral signatures suggest self-similar statistics [Lui et al.(2000), Uritsky et al.(2001)]. The ﬂuctua-

tions in the ground based measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld are non-Gaussian and also exhibit scaling
[Consolini et al.(1996), Kov´acs et al.(2001), V¨or¨os et al.(1998)]. In the context of time series analysis, ge-
omagnetic indices are of particular interest as they provide a global measure of magnetospheric output and
are evenly sampled over a long time interval. These indices also show non-Gaussian statistics of ﬂuctua-
tions and anomalous scaling over the short time scales of up to few hours [Consolini and De Michelis(1998),
Takalo et al.(1993), Hnat et al.(2003a), Stepanova et al.(2003), Tsurutani et al.(1990)]. The extent to which
observed statistical features of the geomagnetic indices arise directly from those of the solar wind driver or
the auroral currents is of fundamental interest. This is an example of the generic problem of distinguishing
between features intrinsic to a driven system and those in the driver, when both show scaling. Some recent
studies has focused on direct comparison of scaling properties of the driver with these found in the ge-
omagnetic indices[Freeman et al.(2000), Uritsky et al.(2001), Hnat et al.(2003a)] to establish whether, to
the lowest order, they are directly related.

The diﬃculty with interpreting these observations arises from the fact that statistical features described
above can be recovered from many existing models. Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) and turbulence have
both been extensively used [Angelopoulos et al.(1999), Consolini and De Michelis(1998)],
[Kozelov and Kozelova(2003), Uritsky and Pudovkin(1998)] in the past. Practically, one needs to obtain
experimental constrains with which diﬀerent models with similar characteristics can be tested.
In this
paper we present one possible approach to characterizing the time series in the context of scaling that
does not rely on a speciﬁc model of multi-scale systems[Sornette(2000), Hnat et al.(2003a)]. The aim is to
obtain statistical scaling properties directly from the data.

Here, we will examine the statistical properties of Akasofu’s ǫ[Perreault and Akasofu(1978)] parameter,
which represents the energy input from the solar wind into the magnetosphere, and that of magnetospheric
response as seen by the geomagnetic indices. Previously, scaling has been quantiﬁed over a 10 year data set
for the indices and a comparison between δǫ and the indices included, but was not restricted to, the solar
minimum (1984 − 1987)[Hnat et al.(2003a)]. Here, we will perform this comparison over intervals of solar

minimum and maximum separately. The statistical description of the experimental data will be extended
to 10 standard deviations of the ﬂuctuations.

To facilitate the comparison of all considered quantities we will ﬁrst explore to what extend their
ﬂuctuations exhibit approximate self-similar scaling for temporal scales of 1 − 2 hours. The quality of this
self-similar approximation combined with values of the scaling exponents obtained at the solar minimum
and maximum can be used to characterize each quantity. We will see that values of scaling exponents
on these temporal scales for the geomagnetic indices are diﬀerent from these found in the solar wind ǫ
regardless of the phase of the solar cycle. Remarkably, the scaling exponent of the AL index is unchanged
between solar minimum and maximum whereas the AU scaling exponent changes with the solar cycle. In
this respect, the AU index seems to follow the trend found in the driver, ǫ i.e., the value of scaling exponent
increases with increasing solar activity. We then construct a Fokker-Planck model for ﬂuctuations in the
geomagnetic indices and the ǫ at solar maximum as these exhibit the most satisfactory self-similar scaling.
This allows us to obtain analytically a functional form of the ﬂuctuation probability density function
(PDF) which we can then check against the data. A stochastic dynamical model can then be formulated by
considering the most general form of the Langevin equation and deriving functional forms of the coeﬃcients
that are consistent with the Fokker-Planck equation (see, for example [Hnat et al.(2003b)]).

2 Data and Methods

2.1 Data sets

To facilitate this analysis we used multiple data sets that spanned over diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle.
Two year intervals of data were selected centered on solar minimum and solar maximum. The solar wind
data were obtained from WIND and ACE spacecraft observations. These were collected in the vicinity
of the L1 point approximately 1 AU (Astronomical Units) from the Sun. The periods of coverage, ﬁnal
sampling frequencies and number of samples are given in the Table 1. The geomagnetic indices and the
corresponding spacecraft data sets are not contiguous. The calibrated geomagnetic data set, from which

intervals of interest has been selected, spans from January 1978 to December 1988 inclusive, while the
spacecraft data are available starting from 1995 for WIND and 1998 for ACE. This available data coverage
does not permit examination of successive solar cycles. We thus need to assume that the statistical
properties of ﬂuctuations are invariant from one solar cycle to the next. In the case of the spacecraft data,
these include slow and fast solar wind streams.

The solar wind velocity measurements, provided by the SWE instrument on board of WIND and ACE
In the case of WIND this resolution is in the range of
spacecraft, have varying temporal resolutions.
75 − 98 seconds while for the ACE spacecraft it changes between 60 − 120 seconds. The magnetometer data
sets, on the other hand, have ﬁxed temporal resolution of 46 seconds for WIND MFI instrument and 16
seconds in the case of the ACE magnetometer. The SWE data sets have been then re-sampled using linear
interpolation to give uniform resolution of 92 seconds for WIND (twice the magnetometer resolution) and
64 seconds for the ACE spacecraft (four times magnetometer resolution). No other post processing, such
as detrending or smoothing, was applied to data. The ǫ parameter is deﬁned[Perreault and Akasofu(1978)]
0 sin4(Θ/2), where l0 ≈ 7RE and Θ = arctan(|By|/Bz), and was
in SI units (Watts) as ǫ = v(B2/µ0)l2
calculated from WIND and ACE spacecraft key parameter databases.

All techniques discussed here are based on diﬀerencing of the original time series over a range of
temporal scales τ . This method is often used in turbulence studies to compare the properties of ﬂuctuations
on diﬀerent spatio-temporal scales (see, for example, [Frisch(1995)]). For a given time series x(t) a set
of diﬀerences δx(t, τ ) = x(t + τ ) − x(t) will then capture ﬂuctuations on temporal scale τ . Here, we will
examine the statistical properties of the PDF of ﬂuctuations δx(t, τ ). The τ parameter will be given in
power law form such as τ = δtAU (1.2)n seconds, where δtAU is a sampling time of the AU time series (here,
1 minute) and n ≥ 1 is an integer. This choice of τ gives a uniform distance between points when plotted
on the logarithmic scale while the small base of the power law (1.2) assures that the adequate number of
temporal scales are explored. We stress that the diﬀerencing is performed only if both x(t + τ ) and x(t)
exist and are separated by time interval τ .

2.2 Statistical Methods

Generalized structure functions (GSF) Sm are widely used to characterize non-Gaussian processes
[Frisch(1995), Hnat et al.(2003a)]. These functions can be deﬁned for ﬂuctuations δx(t, τ ) as Sm(τ ) ≡
h|δx|mi, where m can be any real number, not necessarily positive. If Sm exhibits scaling with respect
to the time lag τ we also have Sm ∝ τ ζ(m).
In this case a log-log plot of Sm versus τ should reveal
a straight line for each m and the gradients correspond to values of ζ(m). Generally, ζ(m) can be a
non-linear function of order m, however if ζ(m) = αm (α constant) then the time series is self-similar
(or more precisely, self-aﬃne) with single scaling exponent α. This special case leads immediately to a
Fokker-Planck description [Hnat et al.(2003b)]. The diﬃculty with computing GSF for higher orders, say,
m > 4 arises from the slow convergence of this method and its sensitivity to large statistical errors in
extremal events in the tails of the distribution. These eﬀects can, as we shall see, lead to large errors
in the estimation of ζ(m) (see also [Horbury and Balogh(1997)] for the discussion of error estimation for
structure functions). One possible approach is to eliminate these extreme events from the ﬂuctuation
time series δx(t, τ ) in a way that is consistent with the growth of the self-similar ﬂuctuations’ range on
each temporal scale. This process is referred to as conditioning. Previously, a similar technique based on
the wavelet ﬁlters has been used to separate the intermittent parts of the signal from the homogeneous
noise in the AE index data[Kov´acs et al.(2001)]. We will condition our GSFs by imposing a threshold A
on the ﬂuctuation size[Hnat et al.(2003a)]. The threshold will be based on the standard deviation of the
diﬀerenced time series for a given τ , A(τ ) = 10σ(τ ). Under conditioning, the GSF can be expressed in
term of the ﬂuctuation PDF as:

< |δx|m >=

|δx|mP (δx, τ )d(δx).

(1)

This procedure is then consistent with scaling ζ(m) = mα if it is present in the data, but for threshold A
suﬃciently large it does not enforce it on the data.

The PDF rescaling technique is a generic and model independent method of testing for statistical self-
similarity in the data set. If the data is self-similar, then a single argument representation of the ﬂuctuation

In this approach PDFs are generated using non-overlapping intervals of the original data, i.e., δx(t, τ ) =
x[mτ ] − x[(m − 1)τ ]. The method assures that ﬂuctuations are not temporally correlated–an important
assumption for a Fokker-Planck model we will consider later. These two methods are thus complementary as
one provides a scaling exponent while the other gives an underlying probability distribution of ﬂuctuations.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 GSF analysis

We will ﬁrst present scaling properties of the GSFs for the indices and the ǫ parameter during solar minimum
and solar maximum. To illustrate the eﬀect of conditioning, we ﬁrst show, in the inset of ﬁgure 1, a log-log
plot of structure functions Sm obtained for ﬂuctuations in the raw time series of the AU index at solar
maximum for orders 1 ≤ m ≤ 6. We see that, for orders m > 3 there is no clear evidence of scaling–the
points do not lie on straight lines. Similar lack of scaling was also found for ﬂuctuations in the AL index
and the ǫ parameter. The main panel of ﬁgure 1 shows exponents ζ(m) obtained by performing linear ﬁts
to logarithms of moments log[Sm(log(τ ))]. We see that the curves ζ(m) are not monotonic functions of

m, excluding the possibility of multi-fractal scaling. We now condition this data set as discussed above, to
check if true scaling properties are not obscured by poor statistics of extreme and very rare events.

Figures 2-4 show a log-log plot of structure functions Sm for the δǫ, δ(AU ) and δ(AL) indices at solar
maximum and for order m from 1 to 6. The main indication of successfully recovered scaling after the
conditioning process is the quality of the linear ﬁt to log[Sm(τ )] versus log(τ ). We clearly recover a family
of straight lines with slopes ζ(m), up to order m = 6 for ﬂuctuations in AU and AL indices and in ǫ.
This scaling extends up to temporal scales of ∼ 1 to ∼ 2 hours in good agreement with these reported
earlier[Takalo et al.(1993), Tsurutani et al.(1990), Hnat et al.(2003a)]. Figure 5 shows that ﬂuctuations in
all quantities, at solar maximum, exhibit approximate self-similar scaling to within statistical errors. The
size of these error bars combined with the convex shape of the function ζ(m) for the AL index also allows
a weakly multi-fractal interpretation of the scaling. We stress, however, that the error bars in ﬁgure 5
do not include many other uncertainties (not statistical) that are diﬃcult to estimate. For example, the
WIND spacecraft magnetometer data has absolute accuracy of about 0.1nT and the indices data have
integer values (also in units of nT). Such discreteness in the time series may lead to erroneous estimates
of low order moments while the ﬁnite size of the data could alter true scaling of the high order moments.
Independent of any given choice of a model for the functional form of ζ(m) we can perform a direct
comparison between the ζ(m) measured for the diﬀerent quantities at solar minimum and maximum. In
order to develop a Fokker-Planck approach we will then make a further step and assume that a reasonable
approximation is given by ζ(m) = mα, that is, self-similar scaling.

Figures 6-8 show structure functions Sm for all quantities at solar minimum and with order m varying
again from 1 to 6. We see that moments of ﬂuctuations for the geomagnetic indices show satisfactory scaling
up to temporal scales of 1 − 2 hours. In the case of ǫ at solar minimum there is a departure from a single
set of scaling exponents ζ(m) for the smallest time scales τ < 12 minutes. To facilitate a comparison with
conditions at solar maximum and with the indices we will ﬁt straight lines to obtain ζ(m) for τ = [12, 90]
minutes bearing in mind that this does not capture the behavior of ﬂuctuations on the smallest time scales.
This change in scaling properties for ǫ may reﬂect diﬀerences between solar wind evolution at solar minimum
and maximum related to physical properties of slow and fast wind components[Pagel and Balogh(2001)].

Figure 9: Same format as ﬁgure 5 for data around solar minimum.

Figure 9 is constructed identically to ﬁgure 5 and shows scaling exponents ζ(m) for solar minimum.

To make a comparison between behavior at maximum and minimum we plot, in ﬁgure 10, exponents
ζ(m) at solar minimum and maximum overplotted for AL, AU and ǫ respectively. Examining these ﬁgures
we conclude that the scaling properties of the AL index ﬂuctuations are remarkably insensitive to the
change in solar activity. The values of ζ(m) and the corresponding scaling exponents are the same, to
within the statistical error for solar minimum and maximum. On the other hand the scaling exponents of
ﬂuctuations in both ǫ and the AU index vary with the solar cycle. The scaling of δ(AU ) is distinct from
these of δ(AL) and δǫ but follows the trend of δǫ. A possible interpretation of these observations is that the
AL index ﬂuctuations more closely reﬂect the internal dynamics of the magnetotail and are insulated from
solar cycle related changes in the solar wind. In contrast, the AU index is more strongly coupled to solar
cycle associated changes in the solar wind driver. This is consistent with our understanding of the global
roles of these indices (eg., [Baumjohann and Treumann(1996)]). The ﬂuctuations in AU , however, have
values of scaling exponents diﬀerent from that observed for the driver ǫ at solar minimum and maximum,
which may suggest that (i) ǫ does not completely capture all relevant information about the driver, (ii)
the indices do not fully capture the magnetospheric response or (iii) the diﬀerence reﬂects the non-linear
nature of the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling.

If we compare the scaling exponents of δ(AU ) and δǫ during solar minimum and maximum we see that
both quantities follow a similar trend. The exponents have values closer to that of Brownian motion (0.5)
during solar maximum as compared to minimum. Closer examination of scaling exponents for ﬂuctuations
in the ǫ and the AU index reveals that the diﬀerence αAU − αǫ ≈ 0.06 is almost identical for solar minimum
and solar maximum period, to within the statistical error. This could indicate that the “conversion rate”
of ﬂuctuations in the driver to those in the AU index is nearly constant and independent of the strength
of the driver.

All scaling exponents α derived by ﬁtting ζ(m) = mα are given in the Table 2 together with the
approximate maximum temporal scale τmax for which self-similarity can be identiﬁed in the diﬀerenced
time series. These temporal scales have been derived using R2 goodness of ﬁt analysis for moment with
m = 2. We have also veriﬁed that GSF analysis of combined time series over solar minimum and maximum

3.2 Probability Density Function (PDF) Rescaling

We now present the results of the PDF rescaling analysis which allows us to compare directly the PDFs
of the studied parameters at solar minimum and maximum. Due to the rather poor scaling of the higher
moments for the ǫ ﬂuctuations at solar minimum we will not apply this rescaling to their PDFs. We simply
state that our previous work suggested that PDFs of ﬂuctuations in the geomagnetic indices and that of
the ǫ ﬂuctuations diﬀered signiﬁcantly when considered time interval spanned more then a solar minimum
[Hnat et al.(2003a)].

Figures 11 and 12 show rescaled PDFs of ﬂuctuations in the AU , AL index respectively for solar
minimum (empty symbols) and solar maximum (ﬁlled symbols) while ﬁgure 13 shows these PDFs for the
ǫ parameter but only at solar maximum. These PDFs correspond to the function Ps(δxs) in equation
(2). Each plot shows overplotted Ps(δxs) at four temporal scales, τ = 10, 16, 26 and 42 minutes. These
ﬁgures show data up to 10 standard deviation on any given temporal scale–consistent with the conditioning
procedure described above. All rescaling exponents α used to construct these plots, are taken directly from
the GSF analysis. We ﬁnd that, when solar minimum and maximum data sets are taken separately, these
PDFs collapse on a single curve after rescaling (2) is applied. The quality of the collapse for the PDFs was
checked using the Smirnov-Kolmogorov[Press et al.(1988)] test and the signiﬁcance of the null hypothesis
(both curves drawn from the same distribution) was always found to be above the 0.975 ± 0.05 level.

The rescaling conﬁrms what we have already found by applying GSF analysis, in that a single exponent
α is suﬃcient to give close correspondence of the curves. As we have shown in equation (3) this is consistent
with approximate self-similar scaling ζ(m) = mα from the GSF analysis. Once rescaled, using the values
of exponents obtained separately for solar minimum and maximum, we see that the curves are distinct and
the diﬀerence is most clear for the AU index shown in ﬁgure 11.

We also compared the functional form of these curves by applying normalization to their respective
standard deviation on a given temporal scale, σs(τ ). We found that the normalized PDFs for maximum
and minimum are indistinguishable within the errors for AU and AL. Similar results were reported for
ground based measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld [Weigel and Baker(2003)] where authors also found that
the statistics of ﬂuctuations, when normalized to the standard deviation, is not sensitive to changing solar
wind conditions.

4 The Fokker-Planck Model

The Fokker-Planck (F-P) equation provides an important link between statistical properties of the system
and the dynamical approach expressed by the Langevin equation[van Kampen(1992)]. The F-P approach
can be readily applied if ﬂuctuations are self-similar and statistically independent (uncorrelated)
[van Kampen(1992)]. The above analysis suggests that self-similar scaling is a reasonable approximation
to the data. The independent nature of increments is enforced by considering non-overlapping intervals
for diﬀerencing, as discussed in Section II B.

In the most general form the F-P equation can be written as:

∂P
∂τ

= ∇δx(A(δx)P + B(δx)∇δxP ),

where P ≡ P (δx, τ ) is a PDF for the diﬀerenced quantity δx that varies with time τ and A(δx) and B(δx)
are transport coeﬃcients which vary with δx. It can be shown that, under the assumption of power law
scaling A(δx) ∝ δx1−1/α and B(δx) ∝ δx2−1/α, a class of self-similar solutions of (4) can be found that
also satisﬁes the rescaling relation (2)[Hnat et al.(2003b)]. These assumptions combined with the use of

The simple model described above assumes that self-similar scaling persists for all δx. This assumption is
expected to hold for a physical system for a large but ﬁnite range of δx. In particular, it will break down
as δxs → 0 giving a singularity in the solution Ps as δxs → 0.This singularity, however, is integrable so
that

We have found that ﬂuctuations in the geomagnetic indices in solar minimum and maximum and these
in ǫ at solar maximum exhibit self-similar statistics to a reasonable approximation. We will now show that
the functional form of the PDF obtained from the F-P model (6) is a good approximation for the observed
rescaled distribution Ps(δxs) of ﬂuctuations shown in ﬁgures 11-13. On ﬁgures 11-13 we have overplotted
solution (6), shown by thick dashed line, with α taken to be that obtained from the GSF analysis. Table
3 gives values of all parameters assumed for each of the plotted solutions. We see that all PDFs shown in
ﬁgures 11-13 are well approximated by their F-P solutions. In the case of the geomagnetic indices some
departures of the predicted curves from the observed distributions do occur and can be attributed to the
asymmetry of these observed PDFs.

We note an obvious departure of our predicted curves from the measured PDF for the smallest ﬂuctu-
ations, in all considered cases. This is due to the functional form of (7) where H(δxs) → ∞ when δxs → 0
arising from the assumption that the self-similar scaling extends to arbitrary small ﬂuctuations. To model
this part of the curve, we would need to include the scaling, or lack of thereof, introduced by the uncertainty
in the measurements. We would expect such processes to be dominant for the smallest ﬂuctuations. For
example, if we assume that the smallest ﬂuctuations are dominated by Normally distributed noise, then a
diﬀusion model with a constant diﬀusion coeﬃcient D0 could, in principle, be used to tame this singular
behavior. This stochastic approach can be extended to obtain the Langevin equation for the dynamics of
the ﬂuctuations[Hnat et al.(2003b)]. The Langevin equation can be written in the most general form as:

where the random variable ξ(t) is assumed to be δ-correlated. Equation 8 can be transform into purely
additive noise form:

d(δx)

= β(δx) + γ(δx)ξ(t),

where z =
form of coeﬃcients β(δx) and γ(δx) in terms of a0, b0 (from equation 5) and the scaling exponent α. Such
an equation provides a dynamical model for time series with the required statistical properties.

5 Summary

The response of the Earth’s magnetosphere to the solar cycle and, by implication, a changing character of
solar wind activity, illuminates the interplay between intrinsic magnetospheric dynamics and solar wind-
magnetosphere coupling. Statistical studies provide a simple and yet unifying way to quantify this behavior
in the context of models for intermittency. In this paper we considered scaling properties of the solar wind

13

driver, quantiﬁed by the ǫ parameter, and geomagnetic indices during solar minimum and maximum. We
ﬁnd that:

1. Fluctuations in the geomagnetic indices show approximate statistical self-similarity for a range of
temporal scales. Fluctuations in the ǫ at solar minimum show departure from scaling for τ <∼ 10
minutes. The self-similar scaling emerges as a reasonable approximation for ﬂuctuations δǫ at solar
maximum. Fluctuations in the geomagnetic indices exhibit self-similar scaling on temporal scales
between ∼ 2 minutes to ∼ 1 − 2 hours. The ﬂuctuations in ǫ scales from ∼ 2 minutes to ∼ 1.5 hours,
but only at solar maximum.

2. Fluctuations in the AL index exhibit scaling properties insensitive to the phase of the solar cycle.

3. The scaling exponent of δ(AU ) changes with the solar cycle and the trend follows that of the ǫ

parameter

4. The value of the scaling exponents of indices and that of the ǫ parameter diﬀer from each other at
both solar minimum and maximum. This diﬀerence between scaling exponents of δ(AU ) and the
driver δǫ is approximately the same at solar minimum and maximum.

5. A Fokker-Planck approach can be used to model the ﬂuctuation PDF for the geomagnetic indices in

both phases of the solar cycle and the ǫ at solar maximum to a good approximation

The approximate statistical self-similarity found for the indices for solar minimum and maximum and the
ǫ at solar maximum is consistent with complex multi-scale processes such as turbulence or Self-Organized
Criticality (SOC). The distinct values found for scaling exponents may reﬂect physical diﬀerences in the
solar wind and the magnetosphere but may also be due to the very diﬀerent way in which these quantities
are derived. The ﬂuctuations in the AU index depend on the solar cycle but the scaling exponent is distinct
from that of ǫ ﬂuctuations. Interestingly, the diﬀerence between scaling exponents of δ(AU ) and the driver
δǫ appears to be approximately constant. These observations, when combined together, suggest that the
process involved in generating ﬂuctuations in the AU index is coupled to the solar wind driver, as seen in
the solar cycle dependence. In contrast to the AU index ﬂuctuations, these in the AL index are nearly
insensitive to the change in solar cycle implying that the AL index is a measure of activity intrinsic to the
magnetosphere. This is consistent with the AU index more closely monitoring activity on the day-side and
AL reﬂecting activity in the magnetotail.

The self-similar scaling of ﬂuctuations allows us to model their statistics using a Fokker-Planck ap-
proach. We obtained analytically a functional form of the ﬂuctuation PDF which approximates the mea-
sured PDF rather well. We stress that such an approach links the statistical features discussed here to
dynamical modeling of the time series via stochastic Langevin equations.

Obervational Model for Microarcsecond Astrometry with
the Space Interferometry Mission

ABSTRACT

The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) is a space-based long-baseline optical interferometer for precision astrom-

etry. One of the primary objectives of the SIM instrument is to accurately determine the directions to a grid of

stars, together with their proper motions and parallaxes, improving a priori knowledge by nearly three orders of

magnitude. The basic astrometric observable of the instrument is the pathlength delay, a measurement made by a

combination of internal metrology measurements that determine the distance the starlight travels through the two

arms of the interferometer and a measurement of the white light stellar fringe to ﬁnd the point of equal pathlength.

Because this operation requires a non–negligible integration time to accurately measure the stellar fringe position,

the interferometer baseline vector is not stationary over this time period, as its absolute length and orientation

are time–varying. This conﬂicts with the consistency condition necessary for extracting the astrometric parameters

which requires a stationary baseline vector. This paper addresses how the time-varying baseline is “regularized” so

that it may act as a single baseline vector for multiple stars, and thereby establishing the fundamental operation of

the instrument.

Keywords: SIM, metrology, pathlength feedforward, astrometry, modeling

1. INTRODUCTION

SIM is designed as a space-based 10-m baseline Michelson optical interferometer operating in the visible waveband.

This mission will open up many areas of astrophysics, via astrometry with unprecedented accuracy. Over a narrow

ﬁeld of view SIM is expected to achieve a mission accuracy of 1 µas. In this mode SIM will search for planetary

companions to nearby stars by detecting the astrometric “wobble” relative to a nearby (≤ 1◦) reference star. In its

wide-angle mode, SIM will be capable to provide a 4 µas precision absolute position measurements of stars, with

parallaxes to comparable accuracy, at the end of a 5-year mission. The expected proper motion accuracy is around

4 µas/yr, corresponding to a transverse velocity of 10 m/s at a distance of 1 kpc.1

The SIM instrument does not directly measure the angular separation between stars, but the projection of each

star direction vector onto the interferometer baseline by measuring the pathlength delay of starlight as it passes

through the two arms of the interferometer. The delay measurement is made by a combination of internal metrology

measurements to determine the distance the starlight travels through each arm, and a measurement of the central

white light fringe to determine the point of equal pathlength.

SIM surveys the sky in units called tiles. A tile is deﬁned as a sequence of measured delays corresponding to

multiple objects all made by a single baseline vector ~b and central pointing of the instrument – that is, all the mea-

surements in a tile are from objects that are within a single astrometric FOR (ﬁeld of regard of the instrument), which

is approximately 15◦ × 15◦. The existence of a single baseline vector insures that the system of equations developed

from the observations to extract the astrometric parameters is not underdetermined. However, the collection of such

a measurement set with a single interferometer is actually impossible, as the data collection on a sequence of objects

takes ﬁnite time, over which both the baseline length and orientation do not remain constant.

This paper describes the fundamental steps of how the on–board instrumentation of external metrology and

auxiliary guide interferometers are used to reconstruct the baseline vector suﬃciently accurately so that it can

eﬀectively be modeled as a single vector over the period of a tile observation. This process has been previously

referred to as the regularization of the baseline.2 The notion of the regularized baseline has been used extensively

in a number of grid simulation studies that plan observation sequences, predict mission accuracy, and determine

sensitivities to various instrument parameters.2–4

The process of reconstructing the baseline vector when implemented onboard in real–time is termed pathlength

feedforward, and is a critical component to the operation of the interferometer. Because many of the astrometric

targets will be very dim, it is not possible for the science interferometer to track the fringes and compensate for optical

pathlength diﬀerence variations in real time using the dim target as the signal. As a result the fringes associated

with the science target will be washed out due to uncontrolled motions of the instrument. The adopted solution in

these cases is to use precise attitude information obtained from the two guide interferometers and construct a delay

tracking signal that will be fed to the science interferometer’s delay line in an open loop fashion. This aspect of the

Figure 1. SIM External metrology design

baseline regularization process will be covered in some detail. An overview of the mission and several of the major

subsystems of the instrument can be found in references5–8

2. ASTROMETRY WITH SIM

SIM is designed to measure the pathlength delay between the two arms of the interferometer. The instantaneous

delay value is given formally by the interferometer astrometric equation:4

d(t) =

+ k + η(t),

~b(t) · ~s
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

where d is the external optical pathlength delay synthesized by a combination of internal metrology and white light

fringe estimation, ~s is the normal to the wavefront of the starlight (the unit 3-vector to the observed object), ~b is

the baseline 3-vector, k is a so-called constant (or calibration) term that represents possible optical path diﬀerences

between the light collected from the target object and the internal metrology, and η(t) is the noise in the measurement.

Because of limitations imposed by the optical throughput of the system and the brightness of the observed

objects several seconds of integration time are necessary to bring the average white light fringe estimate to the

required accuracy. Thus, the actual instrument measurement is the following:

(1)

(2)

hdii =

+ k + ηi,

~si · h~bi
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

where hdii is the average measured external delay obtained from internal metrology measurements and white light

fringe estimation, h~bi is the average baseline vector over the period of the observation, and ηi is the measurement

noise.

The fundamental objective of the instrument is to make these delay measurements so that the astrometric

parameters of position, proper motion, and parallax can be ascertained for the stars that are observed. Focusing just

on the problem of estimating stellar positions, the astrometry problem is to determine the vector ~s in Eq. (2) above.

However, all of the quantities above on the right must be treated as unknown because of the µas level precision

requirements of the instrument. (The Hipparcos catalogue has an accuracy on the order of several mas for stellar

positions, while standard attitude determination and alignment systems on spacecraft can determine the baseline

vector to the order of an arcsec.) SIM circumvents this diﬃculty by observing multiple stars, {si}, within its ﬁeld of

regard so that the observation equations can be modeled as

di = si · b + k + ηi,

i = 1, ..., N.

(3)

The critical assumption here is that there is a single baseline vector, albeit unknown, that needs to be solved for

as well as a single constant term. Thus, Eq. (3) consists of N equations with 2N + 4 unknowns. If a new baseline

orientation is used to observe the same set of stars, an additional N equations are obtained, but only at the expense

of 4 additional unknowns necessary to determine the new baseline vector and constant term. It is evident with more

observations the system of equations eventually becomes overdetermined so that the stellar positions can be resolved.

Applying this idea to a set of tiles that covers the entire celestial sphere is the kernel of SIM’s strategy to perform

wide angle astrometry.

The observable in (2) is the average delay measurement made by the interferometer. Considerable analysis,

simulation and technology development and validation has been devoted to the problems of precision white light

fringe estimation and metrology that are used to synthesize this observable.9–15 The focus of this paper is to show

that the model equations Eq. (3) are actually consistent with the data that is collected by the instrument. To see

where a potential conﬂict may arise, observe that because the baseline vector is time–varying, the average position

over the integration period changes from observation to observation. The resulting model over a tile is

hdii = si · hbii + k,

i = 1, ..., N.

(4)

The diﬃculty now is that there is a diﬀerent (unknown) average baseline for each star; violating the assumption

made in (3).

In principle SIM solves this problem by using guide interferometers and external metrology to track the baseline

vector during the observations. The details of this process will be developed over the next two sections. Here will

give the overview of how this is done, speciﬁcally with respect to overcoming the diﬃculty posed in (4).

SIM uses two auxiliary guide interferometers that lock on bright “guide” stars (~g1, ~g2), thereby keeping track of

the directions to these stars, and hence also of the rigid-body motion of the instrument. The third interferometer

switches between the science targets (s1, s2, · · ·), measuring the projected angles between the targets and the interfer-

ometer baseline vector. An external metrology system keeps track of the ﬂexible-body motions of the instrument by

measuring changes in the baseline vectors of the three interferometers in a local frame, or equivalently, determining

their relative orientations.

Because the three interferometer baselines are not collinear, to complete the characterization of the rigid body

behavior of the instrument a third inertial measurement is required. This measurement is termed the “roll” mea-

surement. In the ideal case we show that the SIM instrumentation is suﬃcient in the sense that in the absence of

measurement errors and a priori parameter errors, the collection of measurements made by the guide interferometers,

the roll measurement, the external metrology measurements together with the a priori parameter data consisting of

the positions of the guide stars, the initial guide and science baseline vectors in the local frame, uniquely determine

the baseline vector of the science interferometer in inertial space.

When this is the case the vector hbii in (4) is known for all i. In reality there are both measurement errors and a

priori parameter errors so it can never be assumed that the hbii are known. For any parameter vector p, let b(t; p) be

the estimate of the baseline vector using this parameter vector. In the absence of measurement error the suﬃciency

of the SIM instrumentation is embodied in the statement that b(t) = b(t; p0) where p0 is the true parameter vector.

Let p denote the a priori parameter vector and write

δ~b(t) = ~b(t; p0) − ~b(t; p).

(5)

In Section 5 we show that for |p − p0| suﬃciently small

δ~b(t) = δ~b0 + ~ǫ(t),

where δb0 is a constant vector (so long as the guide interferometers are locked on the guide stars) and |ǫ(t)| is a

residual variation that contributes a delay error much less than the magnitude of the measurement noise ηi and can

be ignored in the analysis.

Now we may write the instantaneous delay equation as

di(t) = ~si · ~b(t; p) + ~si · ~δb(t) + k

= ~si · ~b(t; p) + ~si · ~δb

+ ~si · ~ǫ(t) + k.

0

Let ~si

0 denote the a priori estimate of the position so that ~si = ~si

0 + ~δsi, where ~δsi is the correction vector that is

sought. Thus, after averaging

hdi(t)i − ~si

0 · h~b(t; p)i = ~δsi

0 · h~b(t; p)i + ~si

0 · hδ~b0i + ~si

0 · hǫ(t)i + k.

The quantity on the left is termed the “regularized delay” and is the quantity that is synthesized from the SIM

instrumentation. And since ~b(t; p) is known and the contribution of the term containing ǫ(t) can be ignored, the

unknowns are the corrections to the science star positions and the correction to the baseline vector which is now a

single constant vector over the entire tile. In this sense the idealized model equations in (3) are correct.

2.1. The ideal instrument measurements

We will now get into the details of how h~bi is obtained from the measurements and a priori data. For this purpose

it suﬃces to treat SIM as a set of ﬁducials, ~X1, ..., ~XN , ~Xi ∈ R3. (Here R3 denotes Euclidean 3–space.) In the SIM

reference design, shown in Figure 1, there are a total of six ﬁducials, and in a spacecraft local frame their coordinates

are collected in the matrix ~Xfid (with units in meters):

~bg = ~Xfid(5, :) − ~Xfid(2, :),

~τ = ~Xfid(2, :) − ~Xfid(1, :).

(10)

(11)

(12)

For any pair of vectors in R3, say ~Wi and ~Wj, the vector ~Wij will denote the diﬀerence ~Wij = ~Wi − ~Wj. Thus,

for example ~bs = ~X16. Our interests center around the evolution of the ﬁducials ~Xi(t) over a time period t0 ≤ t ≤ T ,

where t = t0 denotes the beginning of an observation of a tile and t = T is the time of completion. The problem

is solved using the on–board optical sensing systems that include the external metrology system, the guide star

interferometers, and the roll estimator. The signals from these systems are brieﬂy described next.

In the SIM reference design relative distance measurements are made between each pair of ﬁducials except for the

direct link connecting the active science interferometer ﬁducials. The observed variables associated with the external

metrology system are

ℓij(t) = | ~Xij(t)| − | ~Xij(t0)|,

j > i, i = 1, ...5, excluding (i = 1 & j = 6).

(13)

These measurements are relative distance measurements, and (13) is valid for any choice of coordinate frame. Thus,

~bs is determined in the local frame from (10). The problem is to ﬁnd ~bs in the inertial frame. This connection is

made with the guide interferometers.

SIM uses a pair of guide stars to produce two independent delay measurements per observation:

dgA = (~gA · ~bgA) + kgA,

(14)

where ~gA is the position vector to guide star A, with A ∈ (1, 2).

The roll estimator produces a “measurement” similar to the guide interferometers. We designate a guide telescope

for use as part of the roll estimation scheme, and let ~n denote the line–of–sight vector of this telescope. Next we

introduce a ﬁducial rigidly attached to the telescope which is also measured by the external metrology system. Let

~τ denote the vector connecting this ﬁducial with the ﬁducial mounted on the chosen guide telescope. The rigidity

assumption is that

κ = (~n · ~τ )

(15)

where κ is constant for all values of ~n and ~τ over the period of a tile observation.

2.2. The logic of SIM astrometric observations

Now we will describe how (13)–(15) are used to characterize the evolution of ~bs in the inertial frame.

First let us see what can be learned from the observations in (13). Set ~X = ( ~X1, ..., ~XN ), and deﬁne F ( ~X) as the

function with components Fij ( ~X)

Fij ( ~X) = | ~Xij (t)| − | ~Xij(t0)|,

j > i;

i = 1, ...5,

i 6= 1 & j 6= 6.

(16)

We seek the solution to the system of equations

(17)

(18)

(19)

F ( ~X) = ℓ,

ℓ = (ℓij ).

The ﬁrst thing to note is that if ˆU is a rotation matrix acting on vectors in R3, and if ~ξ ∈ R3, then

F ( ~X) = F (~Y ), where

~X = ( ~X1, ..., ~XN ),

~Y = ( ˆU ~X1 + ~ξ, ..., ˆU ~XN + ~ξ)

| ˆU ~Xi + ~ξ − ( ˆU ~Xj + ~ξ)| = | ˆU ~Xij| = | ~Xij|.

The ﬁnal equality in (19) follows because ˆU is orthogonal, and hence, preserves norms. Importantly the converse of

since

(18) also holds:

Property 1: If F ( ~X) = F (~Y ) for some pair ~X and ~Y (in a small neighborhood N of ~X0), then there exists a

rotation matrix ˆU and 3–vector ~ξ such that ~Yi = ˆU ~Xi + ~ξ for all i.

This is the fundamental result which links the local and inertial frames. The linear justiﬁcation of this principle

is that since F ( ~X) = F (~Y ) and to ﬁrst order F (~Y ) = F ( ~X) + F ′( ~X)(~Y − ~X), it follows that ~Y − ~X must be in the

kernel of F ′( ~X), which can be characterized as the rigid body motions of the ﬁducial system. It is not diﬃcult to

extend the linear argument to the full result.

dgA = (~gA · ˆU ~b loc

) + kgA,

κ = (~n · ~τ ) = (~n · ˆU~τ loc),

Let ~X denote the vector of ﬁducial positions in inertial coordinates. Then (in the absence of noise) ~X solves (17).

If ~X loc is a solution to (17) computed in a local spacecraft coordinate frame, then Property 1 states that there is a

rotation matrix ˆU such that

for every pair of ﬁducials ~Xi and ~Xj. Thus the matrix ˆU is the transformation between the local and inertial

coordinate frames. And since the science baseline vector ~bs is known in local coordinates from external metrology

measurements, the problem of determining ~bs in inertial coordinates is solved once we obtain ˆU , viz.

The equations for obtaining ˆU are provided by the guide interferometer measurements and the roll estimator.

The guide measurements may be written as

with ~b loc

g

assumed known from external metrology data. The third equation needed to determine ˆU is provided by

the roll estimator, which has the form from (15)

where ~n, κ and ~τ loc are all known. We now have 3 equations with which to determine ˆU . (The set of orthogonal

matrices live in a space of three dimensions, so three non–redundant equations are suﬃcient.) Note that the roll

estimator equation has essentially the same form as the guide equation. The correspondences are that the guide

measurement is replaced by a constant value using the rigidity assumption of the structure connecting the ﬁducials

used for roll, the inertial position of the guide star is replaced with the inertial line of sight vector of the telescope,

and the guide interferometer baseline vector is replaced with roll vector connecting the two ﬁducials.

3. SOLVING THE BASELINE VECTOR EQUATIONS

As described above, there are two components to the problem of determining ~b(t; p). The ﬁrst part inverts the 1–D

external metrology measurements into position vectors computed in the spacecraft local frame for all of the ﬁducials.

The second part uses the guide interferometer measurements together with the roll estimator equation to determine

the transformation between the local frame and the inertial frame.

3.1. Inverting the external metrology measurements

Because in general the system of external metrology equations Eq. (17) is overdetermined, the estimate of the ﬁducial

positions ~Xi is derived from the solution to the nonlinear least squares problem

|F ( ~X) − ℓ|2,

min
X

(24)

where ℓ is the vector with components ℓij. In the case of the reference design, ℓ is a 14–vector comprised of links

between every pair of the six ﬁducials of the external metrology subsystem, except for the one pair that is a direct link

between the ﬁducials of the active science interferometer baseline. Let F ′ denote the diﬀerential of the function F

at ~X 0. The rows of F ′ are constructed from the gradients of the functions Fij . These gradients are easily calculated

analytically as

∇Fij ( ~X0) = [01,3(i−1),

, 01,3(j−i−1), −

, 01,3(N −j)],

(25)

( ~X 0
| ~X 0

j − ~X 0
i )T
j − ~X 0
i |

( ~X 0
| ~X 0

j − ~X 0
i )T
j − ~X 0
i |

where 0s,t is the zero matrix with s rows and t columns. Thus F ′ is a 14 × 18 matrix corresponding to the 14

metrology measurements and 18 coordinates representing the 6 ﬁducial positions. Let F ′† denote the pseudoinverse

of the diﬀerential of F at ~X 0. (The pseudoinverse only needs to be calculated once at the beginning of the tile.)

Then the iteration scheme beginning with ~X 0 = ( ~X 0

1 , ..., ~X 0

N ),

~X k = ~X k−1 + F ′†[ℓ − F ( ~X k−1)],

(26)

can be shown to converge to the unique solution of (24) using a Gauss-Newton convergence argument. This solution

is contained in a ball of radius 2|F †l| about ~X0 and an O(|ℓ|3) error is incurred if the iteration is stopped at k = 2;

which is suﬃcient for both SIM requirements as the constraints on the magnitude of the ﬂexible body motion of

the ﬁducials leads to |ℓ| ≈ 10−5m. The use of the pseudoinverse in (26) is equivalent to constraining certain linear

combinations of ﬁducial positions to remove the rigid body motions of the system.

3.2. The attitude equations

The second part of the algorithm for estimating ~b(t) requires solving for the attitude. The three equations for

obtaining the transformation, ˆU, between the local and inertial frames are provided by the guide interferometer and

the roll estimator equations.

~ω → ˆS(~ω),

where,

and

ˆU can be parameterized in several ways. We will make use of the fact that there is a skew–symmetric matrix ˆS

such that ˆU = exp( ˆS) so that ˆU has the series expansion

ˆU = ˆI + ˆS + ˆS2/2! + ˆS3/3! + ....

We will also use the 1–1 correspondence between the set of skew symmetric matrices and 3–vectors via the mapping

Without loss of generality we may assume that ˆU ≈ ˆI because of on–board attitude knowledge. The quadratic

It can be shown that the solution to (29) produces an error of O(|~ω|4) in determining ˆU . (This is less than a 10−15

rad error for 20 arcsec of motion of the instrument.) Without going into the details of the proof of this result here,

we just remark that it hinges on the simple observation that for any skew symmetric matrix ˆS, the distance from

ˆI + ˆS + ˆS2/2 to an orthogonal matrix is |O( ˆS4)|. And this follows by noting that

( ˆI + ˆS + ˆS2/2)(I + ˆS + ˆS2/2)T = ˆI + ˆS + ˆST + ˆS ˆST + ˆS2/2 + ( ˆS2)T /2 +

+ ˆS( ˆS2)T /2 + ˆS2 ˆST /2 + ˆS2( ˆS2)T /4 =

= I + ˆS4/4,

(33)

where ˆI denotes the identity matrix and we have used ˆST = − ˆS and ( ˆS2)T = ˆS2. (Recall that a matrix ˆX is

orthogonal if ˆX ˆX T = ˆI.)

Rewriting (29) as

~ω = T −1

exty − T −1

extGext(~ω),

the solution can be obtained by a ﬁxed point iteration on the mapping deﬁned above on the right:

value in (35):

and ~ωII as the ﬁrst iterate:

~ωI = T −1

~ωII = ~ωI − T −1

This second order approximation accommodates ﬂexible ﬁducial motions on the order of tens of microns in the

inversion of the external measurements and rigid body motions of 100 µrad in the attitude equations. These are

both signiﬁcantly larger than SIM requirements. As an example of these approximations, the plots in Figures 2

and 3 show induced motion of this magnitude in the system. The x and z axis motion shown are due to large (20

as) sinusoid motion of the baseline, while the y axis motion is due mostly to ﬂexible body motion superimposed on

the rigid body displacement. Figure 4 shows the error in the estimated baseline components using the quadratic

model. It is seen that these errors are sub–picometer, as the error analysis predicts. These methods could of course

accommodate a larger range of motion at the expense of utilizing more iterations in the solution of the external

4. A GEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION

The solution to the set of non-linear equations that governs the evolution of the baseline vector has a geometric

interpretation that will be discussed here. To facilitate this we introduce the baseline strain parameter ǫ

ǫ(t) =

b(t) − b(t0)
b(t0)

(41)

which we expect to be ∼ µrad because the change in the baseline length will be on the order of 10 µm.

Again retaining terms through second order in ~ω(t), we parameterize the instantaneous interferometer baseline,

~b(t), as follows:

~b(t) = b(t0)

4.1. Science Interferometer Delay Equation

The expression (42) allows us to write the delays for all three interferometers. Thus, to second order in ~ω one obtains

the following expressions for the time-varying delays of the science and the two guide interferometers:

ds(t) ≡ ks(t) + bs(t0)

Taking into account that, because of the ﬂexible body motions, the rate of the attitude drifts of the guide

interferometers is diﬀerent from that of the science interferometer, we may write:

~ωg(t) = ~ωs(t) + [~θg(t) × ~ωs(t)] + O(θ2

g ),

(45)

where ~θg(t) is the rate of temporal drift of the guide interferometer baseline’s orientation relative to that of the science

interferometer. Also, due to the ﬂexible body motions, the interferometers may be misaligned at the beginning of

the observations. We deﬁne the contribution of this misalignment vector, ~ω0g(t0), to the initial baseline orientation

of the guide interferometer as below:

~ng(t0) = ~ns(t0) + [~ω0g(t0) × ~ns(t0)] + O

Subtracting the initial conditions from the time-varying delays tracked by the guide interferometers, Eq.(44),

together with Eqs.(45),(46), deﬁne the instantaneous change in the science interferometer baseline orientation. How-

ever, the obtained system of equations is underdetermined. This is why only two out of three components of the

attitude drift vector ~ωs(t) may be determined this way. We call the undetermined component - the roll component

- and denote it αs(t). For the determination of this component of the attitude vector SIM uses the roll estimator

given by Eq.(23).

the following notations:

In Section 3 we developed the iterations for solving the baseline estimation problem. Here we will present the

ﬁnal solution for the science interferometer in a form that is amenable to geometric interpretation. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne

~b(t0) = b0~n0 − initial science baseline estimate (length, b0 = bs(t0), and orientation, ~n0 = ~ns(t0));

~sj, ~g1, ~g2 − unit vectors for j th science star and that for the two guide stars;

ds(t), dg(t) − instantaneous interferometric delays, of science and guide interfereometers;

k0s − constant part of calibration term for the science interferometer at the beginning;

∆ks(t), ∆kg(t) − contribution of a temporal drifts in the calibration terms;

~ω0g − initial misalignment of the guide interferometer baseline′s orientation relative to that

of the science interferometer;

~θg(t) − contribution of the temporal drift of the guide interferometer′s orientation relative

to that of the science interferometer (taken care by the external metrology);

αs(t) − magnitude of roll of the science interferometer (determined from Eq.(23)).

Given the solution of the attitude matrix, ~ωs(t), and equation (43), and the presented notations, the instantaneous

delay of the science interferometer is obtained in the following form:

ds(t) = k0s + ∆ks(t) + b0

A variation in the average calibration term, k, within a tile has implications on the overall astrometric accu-

racy. Such inner-tile k variation translates to a distortion of the relative geometry for the objects in the tile. The

implications of inner-tile k variation on the grid reduction accuracy is current topic of study.

4.2. Geometric Interpretation

The expressions for the science delay (47)-(49) obtained above have a clear geometric interpretation. A discussion

of the signiﬁcance of the diﬀerent terms contributing to the science delay is taken up below.

The ﬁrst two terms in (47) are the constant delay oﬀset and the total temporal variation in this delay since

the beginning of the tile observation. In the current SIM reference design,5 the challenge is to keep the temporal

variation in this term small, such that its total contribution to the science delay will be negligible (on the order

of tens of picometers). The terms in the big parentheses are scaled with the change of the baseline’s length, ǫ(t);

the magnitude of this scaling function is on the order of 1 µrad, (c.f.

(41)). The ﬁrst term in the parenthesis

is the usual form for the interferometric delay (~b · ~s), which represents the constant delay at the beginning of the

observations of the tile. The second term in this parenthesis is the feed-forward signal, ∆zff(t), which is given in (48).

The ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (48) are the ﬁrst- and second-order feed-forward signals that update the instantaneous

attitude of the science interferometer’s baseline vector as measured in the local inertial frame. The third term in this

expression is the second order contribution introduced by the temporal changes in the baseline lengths of the two

guide interferometers (ǫg, ǫg) which are coupled to their initial misalignments (ω0g, ω0g) with respect to the science

interferometer’s baseline vector. The next term in Eq. (48) is due to the interaction between the ﬁrst order feed-

forward signal and the rigid-body motions of the entire extended structure. It’s instantaneous contribution is given

by the accumulated temporal drifts in the guide interferometers baselines orientation over the time (θg, θg). The last

term – is the second order contribution of the science interferometer’s baseline roll vector (given by αs) to the total

science interferometer’s delay.

One of the results that immediately follows from the presented analysis is the criteria for choosing the positions

of the guide stars in the tile. Indeed, one may see that all the terms responsible for the feed-forward signal have

tetrahedron constructed from the three vectors, namely the unit vector of baseline orientation ~n0 and the directions

to the two guide stars ~g1 and ~g2. As this quantity appears in the denominator, it is preferable to have it as large

as possible, thus minimizing the ﬁrst and second order terms. In addition, by minimizing their contributions, one

minimizes the contribution of guide star position errors to the estimate of science delay. The SIM reference design

is near optimal in the sense that the guide stars are placed 90◦ apart, with each guide star nearly orthogonal to the

interferometer baseline vectors.

5. BASELINE REGULARIZATION CONCEPT

When all the parameters used to determine the baseline vector via the prescription developed in Section 3 are without

error, then the estimate of the baseline vector is constructed without error. But this can never be the case, and in

Section 2 we showed that it is suﬃcient that the error be constant. This is the linchpin idea for the operation of the

instrument.

In Figure 5 the eﬀect of 20 mas errors in the guide star directions are introduced in determining the baseline

vector. The guide star position error results in an error in the estimate of the attitude motion of the system, leading

in turn to an error in the baseline vector estimate. The x axis error is observed to be on the order of .0.77 µm.

However, observe also that this value is highly stable with a peak to peak range of approximately 10 pm. Thus

although ~bs(t) − ~bs(t; p) exhibits micron class error, the important aspect is that the error is very stable as required

in (6).

This example provides corroboration of the notion of the regularization concept introduced in Section 2. Now we

proceed to give a more rigorous mathematical justiﬁcation of regularization in the face of a priori parameter errors,

such as the guide star position error discussed above.

Returning to the prescription for determining ~b(t; p) in Section 3, a priori values must be provided for the following

parameters:

Guide Interferometer Parameters:

~gi = guide star position vectors (i = 1, 2)

ki = guide interferometer constant terms (i = 1, 2)

Roll Estimator Parameters:

κ = inner–product of roll vector τ with guide telescope unit line–of–sight vector

Optical Truss Parameters:

~X 0 = initial vector of all ﬁducial positions in a s/c local frame

The totality of these parameters constitute the parameter vector p,

p = (~g1, ~g2, c1, c2, κ, ~X 0)

that is used to deﬁne the baseline estimate. In what follows we will assume the true parameter vector is

p0 = (~g1 + ~δg1, ~g2 + ~δg2, c1, c2, κ + δκ, ~X 0 + ~δX 0),

while the nominal parameter vector is

p = (~g1, ~g2, 0, 0, κ, ~X 0).

(50)

(51)

(52)

Hence the error parameter vector is the diﬀerence

p0 − p = ( ~δg1, ~δg2, c1, c2, δκ, ~δX 0).

(53)

We will now prove a “weak” version of regularization that asserts to ﬁrst order (the meaning of which is made

more precise below) the diﬀerence between the baseline estimate and the true baseline vector is constant. Some

comments on the second order errors that are ignored in this analysis are made at the end of this section.

The following nomenclature will be used in the course of establishing the regularization result.

Zeroth order: A quantity expressed in meters or radians (e.g. the length of an interferometer baseline vector.)

First order: A quantity expressed in terms of um or µrad, or a product of a ﬁrst order term with a zeroth order

term (e.g., the magnitude of the elastic deformation of the optical truss, s/c attitude stability, guide star position

error.)

Second order: A product of ﬁrst order quantities, or a product of a second order term with a zeroth order term.

Let ~δb

s denote the initial error in the science baseline vector stemming from the ﬁducial error term ~δX 0. Also let

ˆωI , ˆωII denote the attitude rotation vectors in (38)-(39) obtained using the parameter vector p instead of the true

vector p0. Then by taking diﬀerences we obtain

~bs(t; p0) − ~bs(t; p) = ~δb0

This can be further simpliﬁed to

~bs(t, p0) − ~bs(t; p) = δ~b0

s + (~ωI − ˆωI ) × ~bloc

s

(55)

(56)

because to ﬁrst order ~ωI = ~ωII and ˆωI = ˆωII since the iteration in (39) is a second order correction (see deﬁnition

of G in (31)). Once we show that (~ωI − ˆωI) is constant to ﬁrst order, we will be done since ~bloc

is constant to zeroth

s

order (its variations are due to elastic motions of the instrument).

With these deﬁnitions the true (second order) attitude equation is given by

while the attitude equation using the parameter vector p is

Examining these terms it is seen that to ﬁrst order δy is a constant.

The equations (57)–(58) are solved iteratively to obtain the true and estimated values of ~ω. Thus we have

Because Text is a constant matrix to ﬁrst order and δy is constant to ﬁrst order, it follows that ~ωI − ˆωI is also constant

to ﬁrst order; as was to be shown.

It is possible to develop very speciﬁc forms for the second order error terms due to these initialization errors, but

this is beyond the scope of the present paper. We remark that these errors do drive certain requirements in the SIM

astrometric error budget. For example there is a relatively strong coupling between the initial ﬁducial error δ ~X 0 and

attitude motion that produces a second order delay error of the form

Figure 6. Delay error due to absolute metrology and ACS errors.

In Figure 6 we plot this delay regularization error for a “typical” case arising from a single gauge absolute metrology

error of 5 µm in determining the ﬁducial positions and a 2 arcsec single axis rigid body motion generated from a

random rotation direction with a 10 µrad amplitude sinusoidal motion. The plot contains the associated delay error

for a typical star within the ﬁeld of regard of the science interferometer. If the abscissa is the time–axis in seconds,

and say a 15 sec observation of the star is made, then the delay error of the observation would be the average value

over that particular 15 sec period. The observation period could be at the extremes of the motion, producing a delay

error of ±150 pm, or it could be centered around zero producing zero delay error. In fact any delay error could be

attained within this envelope. Requirements are set to keep this envelope small.

6. SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PLANS

SIM astrophysical science is extracted from a model set of equations that relate the measured optical pathlength delay

to the projection of the interferometer baseline vector onto the star direction vector. These equations presuppose

that the interferometer baseline is ﬁxed in inertial space; which it is not. The main objective of this paper has been

to introduce the reader to the concepts and the instrumental logic of the SIM astrometric observations, especially

as they relate to the fundamental operation of baseline regularization that “ﬁxes” the interferometer in inertial

space. Mathematical arguments were presented to establish this fundamental principle and a precise deﬁnition of

regularization was given. The underlying nonlinear system of equations that is the basis for regularization was

derived and numerical methods to solve them were obtained. A simulation was also developed incorporating the

numerical processing methods of the instrument observables and the results were shown to conform with the theory.

Beyond demonstrating the SIM proof of principle, the regularization equations presented here also form the

kernel of the extensive instrument error budget. The linearized version of these equations are used to determine the

propagation of noise from external metrology measurements and guide star delay measurements to the science delay

error. This error is determined by the geometry of the optical truss together with its orientation in inertial space

with respect to the guide star and target star positions. The propagation factors are used to set requirements on

the integration time of observations, single gauge metrology error, etc. The regularization equations also reveal the

existence of a number of second order errors that arise in the form of products of ﬁducial motion (elastic and rigid

body) and initial parameter error. Examples of errors of this type were given.

Current work focuses on the mechanisms and eﬀects of variation of the “constant” terms in the astrometric delay

equations. Nominally the appearance of the constant term compensates for the lack of a precise internal metrology

gauge that measures the absolute distance between the interferometer aperture ﬁducials to the beam combiner.

However, there are a number of instrument errors that are collected into this single term. For example as the

interferometer observes stars within its ﬁeld of regard several optical elements must be translated and rotated. These

induce non–trivial diﬀraction eﬀects, metrology gauge error due to imperfect corner cubes, reﬂection phase errors

because of a changing angle of incidence of the interrogating metrology beams, and others. Each of these eﬀects

must be played through the delay regularization equations to ascertain their ultimate eﬀect on delay error.

Abstract. Mandelbrot introduced the concept of fractals to describe the non-
Euclidean shape of many aspects of the natural world. In the time series context
he proposed the use of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) to model non-negligible
temporal persistence, the “Joseph Eﬀect”; and L´evy ﬂights to quantify large dis-
continuities, the “Noah Eﬀect”. In space physics, both eﬀects are manifested in the
intermittency and long-range correlation which are by now well-established features
of geomagnetic indices and their solar wind drivers. In order to capture and quantify
the Noah and Joseph eﬀects in one compact model we propose the application of
the “bridging” fractional L´evy motion (fLm) to space physics. We perform an initial
evaluation of some previous scaling results in this paradigm, and show how fLm can
model the previously observed exponents. We suggest some new directions for the
future.

1. Introduction

Ever since it became clear that Earth’s magnetosphere is inﬂuenced
by the sun, signiﬁcant eﬀort has been devoted to establishing the re-
lationship between ﬂuctuations in the energy delivered by the solar
wind to the magnetosphere and variations in the magnetospheric re-
sponse. A particularly important diagnostic for the response has been
the family of geomagnetic indices, especially the Auroral Electrojet
index AE (Davis and Sugiura, 1966). A common proxy for the solar
wind input is the ǫ function (Perreault and Akasofu, 1978) which esti-
mates the fraction of the solar wind Poynting ﬂux through the dayside
magnetosphere.

One approach is to investigate causal relationships, and consider-
able sophistication has now been developed in this (e.g. Ukhorskiy
et al.,2004;March et al,2005 and references therein). However, even

without examining causality, signiﬁcant information can be obtained by
examining the scaling behaviour of ﬂuctuations. A ﬁrst analysis of this,
in the Fourier domain, was done by Tsurutani et al.(1990) using the
power spectrum. Subsequent analyses have introduced other methods
for detecting scale invariance (Takalo et al.,1993;Freeman et al.,2000a,
2000b;Price and Newman,2001; Uritsky et al.,2001). Most recently Hnat
et al., (2002a; 2002b; 2003a; 2003b; 2003c) and Chapman et al.,(2005)
have studied the scaling collapse of the increments of time series.

A fundamental problem has been raised by the evidence for mul-
tifractality in some solar wind quantities (e. g. Burlaga,(1995)) and
the AE index (Consolini et al., 1996). Multifractality is physically
well motivated-at least for solar wind quantities-in that it arises natu-
rally from the intermittency of multiplicative turbulent cascade models
(Frisch, 1995). Multifractality would imply that the Hurst’s “rough-
ness” exponent H is not constant but varies from scale to scale. This
evidence for multifractality in the indices thus means that any compar-
ison of pairs of scaling exponents derived from solar wind and geomag-
netic indices may be problematic (Watkins, 2002; Chang and Consolini,
2001). Preliminary comparisons of solar wind and geomagnetic ﬁeld
measurements made using multiscaling measures (V¨or¨os et al., 1998)
showed similarity at low orders after low pass ﬁltering of the magne-
tospheric quantities. However, Hnat et al.(2002-2003), in examining
a range of solar wind quantities, have recently found some appar-
ent simpliﬁcations. They see the intriguing result that although some
quantities (notably v and B) do not show a simple scaling collapse,
consistent with their well-known multifractality, others (such as B2)
do i.e. they are, in this sense, eﬀectively monofractal. Recently Hnat
et al.(2003c) have extended the 1 year AE/U/L dataset studied by
Hnat et al.(2002b)to the 10 years used by Freeman et al.(2000a). They
ﬁnd that when such long auroral index datasets are examined, AE and
ǫ do indeed have discernably diﬀerent PDFs.

Such analyses are not easy to compare. Some used overlapping in-
dex and solar wind time series (Uritsky et al., 2001), other did not
(Freeman et al., 2000a). Techniques which impose ﬁnite limits on the
integral used to evaluate structure functions have also been explored
((Chapman et al., 2005) and references therein). The choice of solar
wind measures and geomagnetic time series has also varied. It seems
to us thus imperative to try to start to reconcile the various studies
and understand why some show much greater similarity between the
solar wind signal and indices than others. We also believe that the
synthesis of observations will help towards a goal we have proposed else-
where: The deﬁnition of models which are either I) simple, statistical,

tuation phenomenology e.g. the fractional lognormal model sketched
by Watkins(2002)) or II) more clearly statistical physics-based e.g. the
generalised Fokker-Planck model introduced by Hnat et al.(2003b) and
Chapman et al.(2005)).

By analogy with mathematical economics we may think of the Type
I models as modelling the “stylized facts” of the coupled solar wind
magnetospheric system (Watkins, 2002). In this paper we shall in-
troduce one such model: fractional L´evy motion (Mandelbrot, 1995;
Chechkin and Gonchar, 2000b), in order to see how well it can de-
scribe the solar wind ǫ function and the AE family of indices (AE
itself, AU and AL). Preliminary comparison is made with some of the
measurements listed above, and it is shown that the model provides
a good quantitative explanation for the diﬀerence between two scaling
exponents ﬁrst noted in this context by Hnat et al.(2002a) as well as a
possible qualitative explanation for the multifractal behaviour seen by
Hnat et al.(2003c). Future directions are then sketched.

2. Datasets used

The AE and ǫ data are a 1 year subset of those studied by Hnat
et al.(2002b; 2003a). They correspond to the years 1978 and 1995
respectively. We follow Hnat et al.(2002b) by ﬁrstly diﬀerencing the
time series X(t) of the indices AE, AU, AL and ǫ at intervals τ of
1, 2, 3 . . . times the fundamental sampling period (1 minute for the
indices and and 46 seconds for ǫ) to generate diﬀerence time series
δX(t, τ ) = X(t + τ ) − X(t). For further details of the dataset and
preprocessing techniques see (Hnat et al., 2002b) and references therein.

3. Motivation for and testing of a fractional L´evy motion

model

3.1. Fractional L´evy motion as a bridge between L´evy

flights and fractional Brownian motion

As noted by Mandelbrot(1995):

The “normal” model of natural ﬂuctuations is the Wiener Brownian
motion process (WBm). By this standard, however, many natural
ﬂuctuations exhibit clear-cut “anomalies” which may be due to
large discontinuities (“Noah Eﬀect”) and/or non-negligible global
statistical dependence (“Joseph Eﬀect”). [Mandelbrot’s book “The
Fractal Geometry of Nature”] ... shows that one can model various
instances of the Noah eﬀect by the classical process of [standard

L´evy motion] (sLm), and various instances of the Joseph eﬀect by
the process of [fractional Brownian motion] (fBm).

Takalo et al.(1993) were the ﬁrst to use fBm as a model of the auroral
indices, but it subsequently could not describe the highly non-Gaussian
leptokurtic distributions seen in diﬀerenced solar wind and geomagnetic
index quantities. This can for example be seen in Fig. 7 of (Chapman
et al., 2005) where the pdf of diﬀerences δX of AE is contrasted with
the Gaussian pdf of an fBm with equal Hurst exponent H. Similarly
we are are aware of only a small number (Kabin and Papitashvili,
1998; Consolini et al., 1997; Hnat et al., 2002a; Bruno et al., 2004) of
discussions of the use of truncated sLm as a model for in-situ solar wind,
magnetotail or ground-based magnetometer time series. One reason
why sLm has not seen wider use here is because it cannot reproduce
the correlated increments seen for both these types of data and also
because it models superdiﬀusive (H > 0.5) rather than the observed
subdiﬀusive (H < 0.5) behaviour. The term “truncated L´evy ﬂight”
usually indicates standard L´evy motion with a ﬁnite variance intro-
duced deliberately by means of a ﬁnite range cutoﬀ (c.f. the discussion
in section 8.4 of Mantegna and Stanley(2000)); however any ﬁnite series
of sLm is eﬀectively truncated, albeit in an uncontrolled fashion (Nakao,
2000).

Mandelbrot(1995) went on to note that:
sLm and fBm, however, are far from exhausting the anomalies found
in nature ... many phenomena exhibit both the Noah and Joseph ef-
fects and fail to be represented by either sLm or fBm ... One obvious
bridge, fractional L´evy motion, is interesting mathematically, but
has found no concrete use”.

Since those words were written, fLm has found applications, notably
in geophysics (Painter and Patterson, 1994) and telecommunications
network modelling (Laskin et al., 2002). We here apply it to essentially
the same need; to compactly describe and unify the “stylized facts” of
the well-demonstrated Noah and Joseph eﬀects in space plasma physics
time series (Watkins, 2002).

3.2. Mathematical definition of fractional L´evy motion

Fractional L´evy motion can be deﬁned using a Riemann-Liouville frac-
tional integral generalising the better-known expression for fractional
Brownian motion (Voss, 1985). We here adapt the notation of equation
5 of Laskin et al.(2002), which deﬁnes a process Wµ,β:

Wµ,β(t) =

t

1
Γ(β/2) Z
0

(t − τ )(β/2−1)dWµ(τ )

(1)

draft12.tex; 20/02/2014; 20:24; p.4

Synthesis of scaling exponents: a fractional L´evy model

5

Equation (1) can be unpacked as a summation of L´evy stable incre-
ments dWµ(τ ) each weighted by a response function (t − τ )(β/2−1). The
µ parameter describes the power law tail of the pdf of dW which falls oﬀ
as P (x) ∼ x−(1+µ). µ = 2 is the special, Gaussian, case corresponding
to fBm. β is the parameter which controls long-range dependence. It
is well known to be related to the power spectral density S(f ) ∼ f −β
for fractal processes with ﬁnite variance (Voss, 1985), but can also
be rigorously deﬁned through fractional diﬀerentiation in other cases
(Chechkin and Gonchar, 2000b).

With µ = 2 and taking in addition β = 2 the response function
becomes unity, giving an uncorrelated random Gaussian walk (WBm).
Keeping β = 2 but allowing µ to vary in the range 0 to 2 describes
sLm. fLm is thus in general a process with µ, β allowed to vary in the
range [0 < µ ≤ 2, 1 ≤ β ≤ 3] and so forms a bridge between the β = 2
sLm and µ = 2 fBm “axes”. fLm thus by construction exhibits both
the sources of anomalous diﬀusion identiﬁed by Mandelbrot above.

These limits have corresponding simpliﬁed Fractional Kinetic Equa-
tions (FKE) for the pdf P (W ), see section 5.2 of (Zaslavsky, 2002).
Putting W = Wµ,β′(x, t) with β′ = β/2, WBm is given by the dif-
fusion equation ∂1
t P (W2,β′) =
x(AP (W2,β′)); and oLm by ∂1
∂2
x (AP (Wµ,2)). fLm should
thus correspond to equation (132) of (Zaslavsky, 2002):

x(AP (W2,1)); fBm by ∂β′
t P (Wµ,2) = ∂µ

t P (W2,1) = ∂2

∂β′
∂tβ′ P (Wµ,β′) =

∂µ
∂|x|µ (AP (Wµ,β′))

(2)

All cases have constant A. Future work is required to establish if this
simpliﬁed form of equation (127) of (Zaslavsky, 2002), the full FKE,
can map on to the Fokker-Planck equation of (Hnat et al., 2003b) or
whether the full equation, including fractional drift and diﬀusion terms,
is needed.

3.3. Self-similarity, the Hurst exponent and peak scaling

We now follow Laskin et al.(2002) to show that Wµ,β is indeed an H-
selfsimilar process. To see this we ﬁrst put τ = cs in (1). We then use
the fact that the increments dWµ(cs) are deﬁned to be 1/µ self-similar
i.e. are equal in distribution ( d= ) to c1/µdWµ(s). Then

Wµ,β(ct) d= cH Wµ,β(t)

(3)

with a self-similarity parameter H given by

H = β/2 + 1/µ − 1 = [β/2 − 1/2] + [1/µ] − 1/2

(4)

draft12.tex; 20/02/2014; 20:24; p.5

6

more usually known as the Hurst exponent. Note that we would not
necessarily expect this equation to hold for more general fractal pro-
cesses. In the fBm case µ = 2 and for that case only we recover the
well known expression that β = 2H + 1. In the sLm case β = 2 and we
ﬁnd H = 1/µ. Recently Mandelbrot(2002) has proposed writing

H = J + L − 1/2

(5)

where he deﬁnes a Joseph (long range dependence) exponent J (=
β/2 − 1/2) and a Noah (heavy tail) exponent L (=1/µ).

The ﬁrst property that needs to be shown in a time series for fLm
to be a candidate model is thus H-selfsimilarity. This can be tested by
a number of methods. The ﬁrst is scaling collapse, which was shown
for the datasets in our paper by Hnat et al.(2002b; 2003a).

An fLm model also implies that the pdf of returns i.e P (δX = 0, τ )
will scale with τ with exponent also equal to H. This was shown in
Fig. 2 of (Hnat et al., 2002b). For convenience in ﬁgure 1 we show
a comparison of the scaling regions of the 1 year signals taken from
the natural time series AE, AU, AL and ǫ. All are seen to scale up to
approximately 26 minutes (≈ 1 hour). Caution is however necessary
because in a natural dataset the moments |δX|q = |X(t + τ ) − X(t)|q
would be expected to be dominated in the small τ limit by the scaling
of the measurement noise on the diﬀerences δX rather than that of the
physical variables themselves (Hnat et al., 2003b).

Interestingly, although the exponent needed to rescale the pdfs P (δX, τ )

of diﬀerences δX taken from fLm is the “full” extended H = H(µ, β)
deﬁned in equation (4), the diﬀerence pdfs have the same shape they
would have for an sLm with the same µ value. This is analogous to the
way in which fBm retains the same Gaussian distribution as the steps
from which it is composed, despite their statistical dependence, and is
why fLm is also known as “linear fractional stable motion” .

3.4. Structure functions Sq and their scaling exponents

ζ(q): H as ζ(1), while the pdf of returns gives
ζ(−1) ≡ −H

One may extend the idea of self-similarity expressed by H to the
generalised q-th order structure functions (Frisch, 1995):

Sq =< |x(t + τ ) − x(t)|q >

(6)

where q need not be integer. If a given Sq is empirically found to be a
power law we can then deﬁne an exponent ζ(q) from Sq ∼ τ ζ(q).

For a stable self-similar process where all moments are ﬁnite µ = 2,
i.e. WBm (H = 0.5) or fBm (0 ≤ H ≤ 1), the exponents of the structure

functions ζ(q) follow ζ(q) = qH, as we have checked by simulating
an fBm using the same fLm algorithm as used for the ﬁgures, in the
µ = 2 limit. By deﬁnition we then have ζ(1) = H. Additionally in
these Gaussian (µ = 2) cases ζ(2) = 2H, which from Equation (4) then
implies 2H = β − 1.

The exponent derived from the pdf of returns can be shown to be
equivalent to ζ(−1) [Miriam Forman, private communication, 2002] so
for self-similar processes (see also our ﬁgure 5) the plot of ζ(q) versus q
is antisymmetric about q = 0 at least insofar as ζ(−1) = −H = −ζ(1).

3.5. Second order moment and J: Pseudo-Gaussian
behaviour of truncated L´evy time series

Because of the relation ζ(q) = qH for WBm and fBm, a complementary
estimate of the self-similarity parameter H can, for these cases, be
obtained from from the well-known growth of the standard deviation
σ(τ ) of the diﬀerence time series δX(τ ) with diﬀerencing interval τ .
Indeed the growth of a measured σ as τ 1/2 in the case of WBm deﬁnes
diﬀusive behaviour. σ is the square root of variance and thus scales like
S2, i.e. as τ (β−1)/2, i.e. it follows Mandelbrot’s (2002) Joseph exponent
J (which from (4) will be identical to H in the Gaussian WBm or fBm
cases).

In the case of L´evy motion, however, whether ordinary or fractional,
the qth order moments Sq (where q > µ) taken from a set of N

data points are theoretically inﬁnite as N → ∞ in contrast to the
convergence seen for Gaussians. It is thus not a priori obvious how the
variance of a ﬁnite-N time series would be expected to scale. This is
signiﬁcant because any simulation that we perform of fractional L´evy
motion is eﬀectively one of truncated L´evy motion; while a natural time
series will also have a ﬁnite variance in practice. The possible relevance
of this question to data is clearly illustrated by our Figure (2), (see
also table 1 of (Hnat et al., 2002b)) in which σ for the solar wind
variable ǫ is seen to scale with an exponent of 0.29 as opposed to the
values around 0.43 − 0.45 seen for the 3 geomagnetic index quantities.
Rather than scaling with H, σ still appears to be showing pseudo-
Gaussian behaviour i.e. following J, in that β = 1.56 for this time
series (estimated by wavelet methods) giving J = (1.56 − 1)/2 = 0.28.
The apparent disadvantage of the loss of a second, independent,
estimate of H seems to be compensated for by the possibility that we
can use the growth of σ to measure β i.e. we can eﬀectively use it as a
measurement of J. On the assumption that fLm describes our data we
can build a table (Table I) of the measured β and H values and then
predict µ using equation (4).

On inspecting Table I the ﬁrst point is that the values of H and
J are so close in the case of AU that if we assume they are exact
the predicted µ becomes 2, eliminating fLm as a model for AU . The
H is sub-diﬀusive, so fBm would remain a possible candidate model;
however the observed (Hnat et al., 2003a) diﬀerence pdfs P (δX) for AU
are non-Gaussian, eliminating fBm. The error bars quoted in Table I

suggest these conclusions may be too harsh. fLm would, however, seem
more suitable as a model for AE, AL and ǫ.

As a test we may also consider the values of H and J for solar wind
B2 obtained by Hnat et al.(2002a). Their ﬁgure 3 gives H = 0.42 in
our parlance, while they report a scaling exponent for σ of 0.28 (i.e. J).
Inserting this into equation (4) predicts µ = 1.56, which is equivalent
to the 1/α of their equation (3) (see also their Figure 4) which they
ﬁnd to be 1/0.66 = 1.5, encouragingly good agreement.

3.6. Fractional L´evy simulation: Comparison with first

and second order measures

We can then now simulate fLm using parameters drawn from natural
data to see if the inferences we have drawn above are indeed consistent,
and to qualify fLm as at least a possible proxy for these time series. We
use the published algorithm of (Wu et al., 2004). This has the advantage
of being linked more closely to the deﬁnition of fLm from equation
(1) than the (faster) approach of replacing (Chechkin and Gonchar,
2000b)a Gaussian random number generator by a L´evy generator in
otherwise standard Fourier ﬁlter methods (Voss, 1985). A comparison
of these two approaches will be reported in a future paper.

We show simulation results for synthetic AL and ǫ time series. These
were speciﬁed by the ordered pairs (β, µ) of (1.86,1.88) and (1.58,1.51)
respectively. The P (δX = 0, τ ) scaling for both series (Figure 3) is
seen to follow H as we expect, so both model series have very similar
measured H values, as we also saw in their natural counterparts (Figure
(1)). Conversely, for ﬁnite samples of fLm, however, modelling AL and
ǫ we see from Figure (4) that rather than following τ 1/µ(= τ L), the σ
measured on the diﬀerence time series δX still grows as τ (β−1)/2(= τ J )
i.e. it does, as postulated in subsection 3.5, measure J rather than L.
This eﬀect requires some discussion. It seems to be a further man-
ifestation of the “pseudo-Gaussian” behaviour of truncated standard

draft12.tex; 20/02/2014; 20:24; p.9

N. W. Watkins et al.

L´evy motion (Chechkin and Gonchar, 2000a), and known (Nakao, 2000)
to be responsible for the result ζ(2) = 1 in that case (see also Fig-
ure 5). Our simulations have clearly demonstrated that it generalises
to the long-range dependent fLm case i.e. that in general for fLm
ζ(2)/2 = J = (β − 1)/2. This conclusion is most clearly supported
by Figure 5 where the ζ(2) value can be read oﬀ as following this
relation over the range β = 1.5 to 2.5. The agreement is poorer at
smaller β values tested. We currently think this reﬂects known diﬃcul-
ties with accurately simulating strongly anticorrelated fLm (Chechkin
and Gonchar, 2000b). The eﬀect has previously been remarked on in the
truncated standard L´evy paradigm; for example the S&P 500 ﬁnancial
time series, depicted by (Mantegna and Stanley, 2000) where β = 2
(their Fig. 11.4.a) so σ grows as τ 1/2 (their Fig. 11.3a), in contrast to
an H value from peak scaling of 0.71 (their Fig. 9.3).

In the multifractal modelling community the power spectrum has
long been seen as only just one of several ways of measuring ζ(2). For
this reason a diﬀerence in the value of ζ(1) 6= ζ(2)/2 has sometimes been
claimed as direct evidence of the inapplicability of any additive model
and thus the immediate need for a multiplicative model (Schertzer and
Lovejoy, 1987).

Conversely our result would seem to suggest that any truncated
stable additive model other than the fBm/WBm limiting cases is likely
to show ζ(1) 6= ζ(2)/2, and ζ(2)/2 = J = (β − 1)/2 without the need
for a multiplicative model. This may be understood as being because
truncated L´evy motion, whether standard or fractional, behaves as a
bifractal (Nakao, 2000). There may be natural time series where addi-
tive fLm is actually the most natural model, or at least an economical
and easily speciﬁed one.

3.7. ζ plots and the multifractality of truncated L´evy

motions

At this point it may be objected that we have not tested any predictions
of the fLm model against the behaviour of natural time series other
than those properties used to specify it. Our ﬁrst additional check is
thus to examine the multi-aﬃne behaviour seen in the data and the
model using the “ζ plots” deﬁned in section 3.4. Such a plot, showing
scaling exponent ζ(q) versus moment q is shown for the data in ﬁgure
(6). Interestingly AU most resembles a “classic” multifractal, in that
the points ζ(q) lie on a curve rather than a straight or broken line
(Frisch, 1995). However AE, or at least AL, have ζ which arguably
ﬂattens out near 1 for higher moments. ǫ intriguingly even seems to
fall as m increases. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that seen

for our simulated AL and ǫ time series, whose ζ(q) plots are superposed
on the ﬁgure. In particular a change in the range of τ over which the
simulated AL structure functions are taken to be power laws is enough
to encompass the observed range of ζ plots for ǫ. More detailed com-
parison is at present prevented by the diﬃculty of obtaining accurate
values of Sq for high moments-an issue also aﬄicting analysis of real
data.

4. Conclusions

A signiﬁcant body of data and models now exists for the problem
of solar wind and magnetic index scaling. We have here suggested
a complementary approach, motivated in particular by the need to
i) reconcile diﬀering estimates of scaling exponents (in hindsight the
Joseph and Hurst exponents J and H); ii) model subdiﬀusive behaviour
(H < 0.5); and iii) model long-ranged correlation (β 6= 2). We proposed
the use of a simple and economical model: fractional L´evy motion, to
describe the scaling of the above quantities. Initial consistency checks
with respect to the distribution of returns and the scaling of standard
deviation support the use of fLm, and the multi-aﬃne “zeta plots”
are more qualitatively similar. Importantly we ﬁnd that the degree of
similarity between model solar wind ǫ and the model AL index does

indeed depend on the moment order at which comparison is made,
but that this does not, however, require a multiplicative process to
explain it. The diﬀerence can, rather, be understood as coming from
the bifractality of a truncated fractional L´evy motion. This explains
why some measures such as H from the distribution of returns or pdf
rescaling are much closer to each other than, for example, the σ-based
exponent (which we found to measure J, not H). Further work is now
underway to test the predictions of the fLm model against other scaling
studies such as the cited burst lifetime, R/S, and spreading exponent
investigations.

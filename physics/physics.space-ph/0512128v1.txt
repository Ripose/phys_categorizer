Abstract.

SWISDAK ET AL.: POSITIVE STORM SIMULATIONS

Simulation results from the NRL ionospheric model SAMI2 indicate that

the changes in the F-region over Millstone Hill during the geomagnetic storm

beginning on 3 April 2004 are primarily due to the inﬂuence of a long-lasting

eastward electric ﬁeld, as was previously suggested by Huang et al. [2005].

A simulation of the storm day agrees well with the observational data and

shows that, compared with the ionosphere of the previous quiet day, the peak

electron density in the F-region (NmF2) increased by a factor of ≈ 2, the

altitude of the peak density (hmF2) rose by ≈ 80 km, and the F-region elec-

tron temperature decreased by ≈ 1000 K. Further simulations in which ei-

ther the neutral atmosphere and winds or the electric ﬁeld were replaced by

their quiet day counterparts clearly suggest that the electric ﬁeld played the

dominant, although not exclusive, role in producing these eﬀects.

1. Introduction

After an extended quiet period lasting from 29 March to 2 April 2004 a magnetic storm

began at 1412 UT on 3 April and reached a minimum Dst of -149 nT at 0042 UT on

the following day. Huang et al.

[2005] reported that this event triggered large, long-

lasting changes in the daytime ionosphere, including a strong positive ionospheric storm

phase (i.e., a period in which the F-region electron density increased). Understanding

long-duration mid-latitude positive storms such as this is of particular interest because

they have signiﬁcant eﬀects on large regions of the ionosphere. Buonsanto [1999] noted

that the generation of such events is one of the main unresolved problems in ionospheric

research.

Two mechanisms have been proposed as drivers of such dayside storms: winds in the

neutral atmosphere and electric ﬁelds (see Figure 1). In the former, heat inputs in the

auroral regions are thought to cause global changes in the wind circulation pattern and

thermospheric composition [Rishbeth et al., 1985; Fuller-Rowell et al., 1994], including the

generation of equatorward neutral winds that lift the mid-latitude F-region [Jakowski et

al., 1990; Bauske and Pr¨olls, 1997; Lu et al., 2001]. (In Figure 1, Vn · B < 0 and the

collisionally-coupled plasma is driven up the ﬁeld lines.) On the other hand, Foster and

Rich [1998] reported direct observations of the uplift of the mid-latitude ionosphere by

a prompt penetration eastward electric ﬁeld (in Figure 1 the E × B drift is upward and

poleward). These processes are not completely distinct since, for example, equatorward

neutral winds can maintain a dynamo electric ﬁeld.

Huang et al. [2005] suggested that the proximate cause for the 3 April storm was an

enhanced eastward electric ﬁeld that lifted the mid-latitude ionosphere for several hours.

In this Letter we present simulations that support this conclusion, although the neutral

winds do seem to play a minor, but important, role. We describe our computational

model SAMI2 in section 2, present the simulation results in section 3, and discuss our

conclusions in section 4.

2. Computational Model

SAMI2 is a two-dimensional, semi-implicit, Eulerian ﬂuid model of the low to mid-

latitude ionosphere at one geomagnetic longitude [Huba et al., 2000]. Previous studies

have shown that SAMI2 simulations of the F-region electron density are in good agreement

with data from both satellites [Huba et al., 2002] and the Millstone Hill observatory [Huba

et al., 2003].

In this study the simulation domain passes through a point 330 km above Millstone

Hill (42.6◦ N, 288.5◦ E, invariant latitude 55◦) and has north-south extrema at geographic

latitudes of −68.7◦ and 45.2◦. We place 201 gridpoints along each of 114 ﬁeld lines with

non-uniform spacing in both dimensions to achieve better resolution at low altitudes. Test

runs in which the number of points in either dimension is doubled suggest our results have

converged. The ﬁrst and last gridpoints of each ﬁeld line are at an altitude of 85 km and

the apexes range between 150 and 14,000 km (L values of 1.02 to 3.20).

We model the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld as an oﬀset, tilted dipole for which the center as

well as the geographic latitude and longitude of the magnetic north pole have been chosen

to maximize agreement in the simulation domain with the International Geomagnetic

Reference Field. Parallel to the ﬁeld, i.e., along a ﬂux tube, we solve the ﬂuid continuity

and momentum equations for seven ion species (H+, He+, N+, O+, N+

2 , NO+, and O+

2 ) and

the temperature equation for three (H+, He+, and O+). The temperatures of the other

four ions are taken to be equal to that of O+. To model the electrons we assume that the

charge density and parallel current density vanish, which then determines the electron

density and velocity parallel to the ﬁeld; the electron temperature equation is solved

separately. The empirical models NRLMSISE-00 and HWM93 [Picone et al., 2002; Hedin

et al., 1991] specify the composition and winds of the neutral atmosphere, respectively.

We assume that transport perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld is solely due to E × B

drifts. To ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld throughout the simulation domain we extrapolate from

measurements of the east-west (Ex) and north-south (Ey) components of the electric ﬁeld

in the F-region above Millstone Hill by making two assumptions. The ﬁrst, that every

(dipolar) ﬁeld line is an equipotential, allows us to calculate the E × B drift everywhere

on a ﬁeld line once we know it anywhere on a ﬁeld line. The second, that the (vertical)

drift varies as L2 at the magnetic equator, is valid when the electric ﬁeld is curl-free and

the azimuthal neutral wind dynamo is negligible [Eccles, 1998]. Given a drift at Millstone

Hill of magnitude vM the magnitude of the drift at any other point in the simulation

domain is

where θ is the magnetic co-latitude. The direction of the drift is always perpendicular to

SWISDAK ET AL.: POSITIVE STORM SIMULATIONS

The incoherent scatter radar at Millstone Hill measures three-dimensional ion velocities

(from which the electric ﬁeld can be determined) and meridional neutral winds with a

time resolution of ≈30 minutes. Typical errors are ±0.2 mV/m for the electric ﬁeld and

±20 m/s for the wind. Huang et al. [2005] give a more complete description of the mea-

surements. The two relevant components of the electric ﬁeld as well as the corresponding

E × B drifts are plotted in the top two panels of Figure 2. Because of the non-zero

magnetic declination at Millstone Hill (≈−15◦) both the east-west and north-south com-

ponents contribute to the drift, although the north-south contribution is minimal until

≈20 UT on 3 April. At Millstone Hill a 3 mV/m east-west electric ﬁeld implies a total

drift speed of ≈60 m/s and a vertically projected drift speed of ≈20 m/s.

Unfortunately, although we have measurements of the average F-region meridional neu-

tral wind above Millstone Hill, there is no straightforward way to extrapolate this data to

the entire simulation domain. Moreover, we have no measurements of the zonal winds. We

instead use the velocities (both meridional and zonal) from the empirical model HWM93.

The model values for the meridional wind are plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 2

along with the observations. While the basic features of the data sets agree there are some

notable diﬀerences, particularly in the magnitude of the wind during the early evening

and pre-dawn hours (local time at Millstone Hill = UT-5). Possible eﬀects of these dis-

crepancies are discussed further in Section 4. Note that because of the large dip angle at

Millstone Hill only 1/3 of the meridional wind speed is projected along the magnetic ﬁeld.

SAMI2’s empirical models of the neutrals and solar ﬂux depend on the geophysical

parameters F10.7, F10.7A and Ap — the previous day’s solar ﬂux at 10.7 cm, the 81-day

centered average of F10.7, and the Ap index. For both days F10.7A = 105.1; on 2 April

F10.7 = 114.1 and on 3 April F10.7 = 108.6. The daily Ap = 3 on 2 April and 41 on 3

April, but we also used ﬁner gradations (e.g., 3-hour ap indices) in NRLMSISE-00 and

HWM93.

3. Simulation Results

In Figure 3 we compare our simulation results to the observed electron densities and

temperatures at an altitude of 330 km above Millstone Hill. The overall agreement is

good, with the simulation successfully modeling the major changes between the quiet and

active days. After the storm begins (≈ 14 UT on 3 April) the electron density quickly

increases, peaking at ≈ 1.4 × 106 cm−3, or roughly 2 − 3 times the density at the same

time on the previous day. Simultaneously the electron temperature drops by ≈1000 K.

However several discrepancies can be seen. The ﬁrst is in the electron temperature on

2 April when the model overshoots the observed value by roughly 10% at 12 UT and

remains too high for several hours. This is probably due to the photoelectron heating

model used in SAMI2 and is discussed further in Section 4. A second discrepancy is the

∼ 1 hour lag between the onset of the simulated and actual storm on 3 April. Winds can

cause such a delay by retarding the ﬂow of material up a ﬁeld line, but both the modeled

and true meridional winds are relatively modest at this time. However HWM93 predicts

a relatively large zonal wind (≃ 100 m/s) during this period which, when projected onto

the magnetic ﬁeld, is large enough to cause the delay. An otherwise identical simulation

that was performed with no zonal winds exhibited no lag in the storm onset.

SWISDAK ET AL.: POSITIVE STORM SIMULATIONS

To better show the eﬀects of the storm on the F-region as a whole we plot NmF2 and

hmF2 at Millstone Hill for both the observations and the simulation in Figure 4. hmF2

remained below 300 km during daylight hours on 2 April but during the storm on the

following day it rose by 50 − 80 km. Viewed from a ﬁxed altitude of 330 km the rise of the

F-region leads to an increase in the local electron density and a decrease in the electron

temperature (see the top panel of Figure 3), i.e., cooler, denser plasma moves to higher

altitudes. Note that this mechanism does not depend on what process lifts the F-region.

To test the relative importance of the electric ﬁeld and the neutral atmosphere and

winds in driving these large changes we performed two further simulations of the storm

day. In the ﬁrst we replaced the models of the neutral atmosphere and winds with their

quiet day counterparts; in the second we used the storm day neutral atmosphere and

winds and the quiet day electric ﬁeld. The results are shown in Figure 5.

For the storm day electric ﬁeld and the quiet day neutrals (dotted black line) the largest

change from the original simulation is the ∼ 2 hour delay in the ionosphere’s response to

the storm’s onset. We attribute this to the neutral wind. The quiet day neutral wind

is poleward which, as noted earlier, pushes plasma down the ﬁeld line and suppresses,

albeit not completely, the increase in electron density after 14 UT. There are also some

minor diﬀerences in the temporal evolution of the electron density, particularly late in

the storm (20 − 22 UT) when the simulation density rises as the observed density falls.

In comparison the simulation with the quiet ﬁeld and storm neutrals correctly captures

the onset of the storm but diverges from the observations after 16 UT. In particular, this

simulation underestimates the peak density by ≃ 50%. We attribute this to the quiet

day electric ﬁeld that changes from eastward to westward at ≃ 18 UT, thus pushing the

F layer downward and reducing the electron density. Together these simulations suggest

that the neutrals played a role in the initial stages of the storm but the electric ﬁeld was

the principal driver of the ionospheric evolution.

4. Discussion

We have presented a simulation study of storm-time eﬀects on the mid-latitude iono-

sphere over Millstone Hill observatory using the NRL ionosphere code SAMI2. The simu-

lation results agree reasonably well with the observations on both the quiet and the storm

days. In particular, the model predicts the changes in the ionosphere over Millstone Hill

relative to the previous (quiet) day: the F-peak altitude rose by ≈ 80 km, the F-peak elec-

tron density increased by a factor of ≈ 2, and the F-region electron temperature decreased

by ≈1000 K. We primarily attribute these dramatic changes to the long-lasting eastward

electric ﬁeld observed on the storm day between 12–20 UT that lifts cold, dense plasma

to higher altitudes. We base this conclusion in large part on Figure 5, which indicates

that the storm day neutral wind and quiet day electric ﬁeld do not suﬃciently account

for the observations. By contrast, the active day electric ﬁeld and quiet day neutral wind

do capture the salient eﬀects of the storm: a large enhancement in the electron density

and decrease in the electron temperature.

The variations of the electron density and temperature with altitude were also measured

around 19 UT on both the quiet and active days. Not surprisingly, in light of the data

shown in Figure 4, Huang et al. [2005] found that the storm day had higher electron densi-

ties, lower electron temperatures, and higher hmF2s. Although the simulation agrees with

these trends there are discrepancies, particularly in the temperature, at higher altitudes.

These diﬀerences may be due to SAMI2’s treatment of photoelectron heating. Collisions

are suﬃciently frequent at low altitudes (below roughly 250 km, although there is some

variation with the neutral density) that we assume photoelectrons deposit their energy

locally. Above that point our model expresses the (non-local) heating as a function of the

integral of the electron density along a ﬁeld line. More sophisticated, but computationally

intensive, approaches discretize the electron distribution function in energy space and

solve some form of a Boltzmann transport equation. The transition between local and

non-local heating is continuous in SAMI2, but during non-equilibrium periods unphysical

short-lived temperature plateaus occasionally develop around 450 km. By making ad hoc

adjustments to the details of our model we have established that these features have only

minimal eﬀects on the plasma at lower altitudes.

A thorough study of the origin of the prolonged, storm-time eastward electric ﬁeld

would require a coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere model that is beyond the scope of this

Letter. However two possible sources are (1) a penetration electric ﬁeld associated with a

rapid change in the inner magnetospheric electric ﬁeld at storm onset (e.g., Kikuchi and

Araki [1979], Foster and Rich [1998]) and (2) a wind driven dynamo ﬁeld associated with

high-latitude heating of the atmosphere and the generation of equatorward neutral winds

(e.g., Fuller-Rowell et al. [1994]). Huang et al. [2005] argued for a penetration electric

ﬁeld because it can quickly propagate to low latitudes, in agreement with the minimal

lag between the storm onset and the ionospheric response seen in the data. Furthermore,

no strong equatorward winds were observed at Millstone Hill during the storm. (see the

bottom panel of Figure 2).

A better comparison between simulations and data could be made with more realistic

values for the neutral winds throughout the E and F regions. These can be obtained

through either more detailed observations or a coupled thermosphere-ionosphere model.

In the short term we will pursue the former approach using, for example, measurements

taken at Millstone Hill for the September 2005 ISR World Month campaign (L. P. Gon-

charenko, private communication). Finally, we will also use SAMI3, an extension of

SAMI2 to all longitudes, to investigate longitudinal eﬀects such as the possible generation

of inhomogeneous total electron content (TEC) enhancements by a poleward electric ﬁeld

(Vlasov et al. [2003]).

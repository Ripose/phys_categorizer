Abstract

Thanks to post-ﬂight analyses of several artiﬁcial satellites carried
out during last years, the meteoroids hazard for space navigation and
in-orbit satellites permanence is now clear. Even if catastrophic impact
is a rare event, high meteoroids ﬂuxes can erode and weaken the satel-
lite or space station main structures. However, the main danger seems
to be the impact-generated plasma, which can produce electromagnetic
interferences, disturbing the on-board electronics.

Introduction

Till now, it was a common idea that space debris were the main threat for
spacecrafts. This hypotesis ﬁnds its pillar in a paper by Laurance and Brownlee
(1986). The work was the result of the Solar Max Satellite post-ﬂight analysis,
from which was evident that space debris ﬂux was several hundred times higher
than natural meteoroids ﬂux.

However, during last years emerge some facts that claim for a diﬀerent re-
ality. During 1993 Perseids maximum, Beech and Brown (1993) launched an
alarm, because they noted that impact probabilities with Hubble Space Tele-
scope sized objects, were low, but not negligible. Really, on the night of August
12, 1993, astronauts onboard the Mir Space Station reported audible mete-
oroids impacts and, then, it was veriﬁed that Mir experienced about 2000 hits
during 24 hours and solar panels were hardly damaged (Beech et al., 1995). In
the same night, the ESA (European Space Agency) lost the control of Olympus
telecommunication satellite. The following investigations made clear that the
failure was probably caused by an impact with a Perseid meteoroid (Caswell et
al., 1995).

The satellites LDEF (Long Duration Exposure Facility) and EURECA (EU-
ropean REtrievable CArrier ) take the lion’s share in these studies. Post-ﬂight
analyses on these satellites drastically rescaled the theories of Laurance and
Brownlee on the space debris danger. McDonnell et al. (1997b) showed that
the error in the paper of Laurance and Brownlee was due to the use of a non cor-
rect formula for transformation from crater dimension to particle mass. Then,
this scientists group elaborated a new formula, by using laboratory simula-
tions (Gardner et al., 1997). New ﬂuxes estimates, based on data collected on
EURECA and LDEF, showed that, at micrometer dimensions and 500 km al-
titude, debris population is not dominant as previously thought (McDonnell et
al., 1997b). Really, above 30 µm ballistic limit meteoroids dominates, while, for
thickness between 4 and 5 µm, 18% only of impacts are due to interplanetary
matter. Moreover, the debris ﬂux does not change appreciably in the 30 µm
size regime over the period 1980-1994, owing to atmospheric drag.

It is then very important to know the distribution and dynamics of inter-
planetary matter, in order to properly plan satellite orbits and space probes
courses.

2 Distribution and dynamics of interplanetary

matter

In interplanetary space, there are great matter quantities, coming from disrup-
tion of asteroids and comets. The mass range is very wide1 and is observable
by using several techniques: visual, radar, in situ and others. Crossed refer-
ences among data obtained by these techniques are full of diﬃculties, but not
impossible (Ceplecha, 1992; Foschini, 1997).

Interplanetary matter is subjected to gravitational ﬁelds of Sun and planets.
In a certain sense, it is possible to say that planets are the “road-sweeper”
of the Solar System, because they collect all these particles that are in their
neighbourhood for a suﬃcient time, making some gaps in meteoroids spatial
distribution ( ¨Opik, 1951; see also the ﬁgure at p. 240 in Lindblad, 1987). On
the other hand, the solar radiation pressure, due to the momentum carried by
solar photons, pushes meteoroids toward outer space. In a heliocentric reference
frame, let ~r be the radial unit vector and let ~θ be the unit vector normal to ~r
in the orbit plane; the meteoroid speed is then:

and the radiation force can be written as:

~v = ˙r~r + r ˙θ~θ

m ˙~v ≃ Qpr(

SA
c

)

(1 − 2 ˙r
c

"

)~r − (

r ˙θ
c

)~θ

#

(1)

(2)

where SA is the total amount of energy intercepted, per second, from a radiation
beam of integrated ﬂux density S by a stationary, perfectly absorbing meteoroid
of cross section A and Qpr is the radiation pressure coeﬃcient, proportional to
the total momentum withdrawn from the beam (Burns, 1987). Usually, the
velocity-dependent part of (2) is called Poynting-Robertson eﬀect, while the
radial term is simply called radiation pressure, even if, as Burns (1987) wrote,
there are also other accepted customs.

There is another non-gravitational force, the so-called Yarkovsky eﬀect. This
eﬀect is connected with the name of a polish engineer who ﬁrst described it in
a pamphlet published in russian around 1900 (see ¨Opik, 1951). It is a force
generated by asymmetries in the reradiated thermal energy from a rotating
body exposed to Sun, because the evening hemisphere is slightly warmer than
the morning one. The warmer hemisphere radiated more energy, and hence
momentum, than the other hemisphere, producing a net force, which depends
on rotation frequency, thermal properties and dimensions of the body, and from
Sun distance (Burns, 1987). In a similar way, it is possible to speak about a
“seasonal” eﬀect, where the temperature diﬀerence between summer and winter
1Generally speaking, a ‘meteoroid’ is intended to be a cometary or asteroidal body with a
mass range between 10−9 and 107 kg, even if there is a vivid debate around this deﬁnition.

produces a net force, which depends on polar axis orientation (Rubincam, 1995).
If collisions change the rotational state of cosmic bodies, the amplitude and
direction of the force due to the Yarkovsky eﬀect change in time in a stochastic
way, producing a random walk of the major semiaxis of the body orbit.

The ratio among these forces can vary according to dimensions and masses of
interplanetary bodies, distributing the matter in the Solar System. Only those
particles, that are in the neighbourhood of a planet for a little time thanks to
Poynting-Robertson eﬀect, can survive to the gravitational attraction (“road-
sweeper” eﬀect). The Poynting-Robertson eﬀect become fundamental for bodies
in the range from 0.1 µm to some centimetre (Burns, 1987). The Yarkovsky ef-
fect is dominant for larger bodies (0.1-100 m).
In the asteroidal population,
this eﬀect produces an orbital major semiaxis drift, driving the delivery of me-
teoroids toward Earth (Farinella et al., 1997).

Taking into account observations, made with several techniques, and the
dynamics of the interplanetary matter, it is possible to elaborate a model, in
order to know meteoroids ﬂuxes and concetrations. Now, the starting point is
the model elaborated by Gr¨un et al. (1985) and regarding the interplanetary
matter dynamics at 1 AU (Astronomical Unit ) from the Sun. Throughout the
model, the following characteristics of meteoroids population are considered: (1)
the mean mass density is 2500 kg/m3; (2) the relative speed between diﬀerent
meteoroids, as well as the impact speed on the Moon, is 20 km/s; (3) the ﬂux
onto Earth, as well as mutual impact ﬂux, is isotropic. Divine (1993) extended
this model, taking also into account data from space probes (Pioneer 10 and
11, Ulysses, Galileo and Helios-1), and found ﬁve populations of meteoroids,
each named for a distinctive characteristic of their orbital distributions and of
their mass. Taylor and McBride (1997) used data recorded by Harvard Radio
Meteor Project in order to extend the model by Gr¨un et al. (1985), taking into
account the anisotropies in the meteoroids environment. This radiant-resolved
meteoroid model was precedeed by a reanalysis and correction of speed distri-
bution obtained from radars, which can aﬀect large meteoroids distribution in
Divine’s model (Taylor, 1995). However, Gr¨un et al. (1997) recently developed
a new model from the Divine’s one, including the eﬀect of radiation pressure on
the meteoroids speed and considering impact directions and speeds. The new
model lead to four meteoroids populations on elliptical orbits and one moving
on hyperbolic orbits.

At last, it should be pointed out that other models are now available (Gor’kavyi

et al., 1997; Wasbauer et al., 1997).

Impact probabilities

The higher risk regions are those related to meteoroid streams, that when en-
counter the Earth give rise to meteor showers. In these streams, the meteoroids
number per volume unit can reach very high values, with geocentric speeds up

4

to 71 km/s ( ˇKres´ak, 1993; Jenniskens, 1995). By the time, it is known the last
meteor storm generated during 1966 by Leonids, when a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly
Rate) of 150,000 was recorded2. The next perihelion passage of Leonid parent
body, the comet P/Tempel-Tuttle, happened on February 1998. Then a new
meteor storm is expected. If it will be so, there will be a considerable hazard
for artiﬁcial satellites (Beech and Brown, 1994; Foschini and Cevolani, 1997).

A rough evaluation, of the impact probability of a meteoroid with an artiﬁcial
satellite, can be made assuming an uniform and constant ﬂux intercepting an
area A [m2] for a time t [s]:

−13

I = nF V At · 10

(3)
where V [km/s] is the geocentric mean meteoroids speed and n [km−3] is the
spatial number density of meteoroids contained, during normal conditions, into
an equivalent 1000 km sized cube. During storms or outbursts, it is necessary to
introduce an enhancement factor F , that for Leonids ranges from 300 to 10000
(Beech and Brown, 1994). In order to calculate the spatial number density, it
is necessary to know the ﬂux density of meteoroids Φ [km−2·h−1] in a speciﬁc
mass range, because n is deﬁned as (Koschack and Rendtel, 1990a, b):

(4)

n =

Φ
3600V
The ﬂux evaluation is very diﬃcult, because the Earth encounter a part of
meteoroids only. Moreover, it must be take into account the origin of mete-
oroids: when the parent body is a comet, a part of the nucleus surface only
is active3 and, then, particles are expelled along several preferred directions,
arranging themselves on slightly diﬀerent orbits, even if centered along the or-
bit of the parent body. Furthermore, considering the forces described in the
previously section, meteoroids will move along particular conﬁgurations, com-
posed by several ﬁlaments4. The eﬀect on radar and visual observations of these
structures is that there are one or more peaks during shower activity. Gener-
ally speaking, ﬂux evaluation are made by using visual observations and taking
into account several corrective factors, in order to oﬀset for limiting elements
(Koschack and Rendtel, 1990a, b; Jenniskens, 1994; Brown and Rendtel, 1996).
However, an important limit is due to maximum magnitude (+6.5), correspond-
ing to a meteoroid of about 10−5 kg (Jenniskens, 1994). But with radars, it is
possible to reach magnitude +16, that should correspond to a mass of about
10−9 kg (Zhou and Kelley, 1997). Other advantages are a wide collection area
(for forward-scatter radars it is possible to reach some thousands of square kilo-
metre) and the absence of weather, sunlight or moonlight limitations. However,
2Jenniskens (1995) rose some doubts on this ZHR evaluation, that do not ﬁnd a considera-
tion in radar data. According to Jenniskens, the correct value should be ZHR=15,000±3,000.
3For example, when the Halley comet reach the Sun, about the 3% of its surface is active.
4Some images of these structures can be found in: Beech and Brown (1994), Hughes (1995),

Arter and Williams (1997).

ﬂux evaluations are possible imposing some restrictive hypoteses only: unifor-
mity in space and time, and the mass index constant and equal to a mean value
(Foschini, 1997). Radar data allow us to make a meteoroid streams map, dif-
ferent from that obtained with visual observations. Nevertheless, in both cases,
it is possible to deduce that catastrophic impact is a rare event, even if when
there is a meteor storm (Beech and Brown, 1994; Beech et al., 1995; Foschini
and Cevolani, 1997). When micrometeoroids are considered the impact is not
for example, there is 41% of impact probability for a space station
so rare:
(1000 m2 area, 1 hour exposure), with a meteoroid with mass equal or greater
than 10−8 kg, if there will be a storm like 1966 Leonids (Foschini and Cevolani,
1997). Such a ﬂux can make serious damages to mechanical structures, partic-
ularly solar arrays and antennas, that can not be obviously shielded.

Impact-generated plasmas

The Olympus satellite experience, the post-ﬂight analysis and the calculations
of impact probabilities impose a revision of potential space dangers. The me-
chanical impact do not seems to be a risk, as shown by several cases like the
Hubble Space Telescope (Herbert and McDonnell, 1997) and the Mir space sta-
tion (Christiansen et al., 1997). However, the Olympus failure is a paradigmatic
example: in that case, the impact with a Perseid meteoroid could have generated
electrical failures, leading to a chain reaction which culminated with an early
end of the mission. According to Caswell et al. (1995), a gyro motor stopped,
probably owing to a lack of power, and the satellite lost the reference. Following
manoeuvres in order to acquire a new reference (Emergency Sun Acquisition)
failed, probably owing to a short circuit in a capacitor of the emergency network.
Even if there is not any certainty, it seems that the impact of a small meteoroid
may have generated a plasma triggering discharge of charged surfaces, entering
the grounded spacecraft via the umbilical.

After the Olympus end-of-life anomaly, other authors looked to impact-
produced plasma, rather than the impact itself (Brown et al., 1996; McDonnell
et al., 1997a). It is well known that, during an hypervelocity impact, a fraction
of the projectile and target materials is evaporated and even ionized (Fechtig
et al., 1978). A plasma cloud is then created almost instantaneously after the
impact and expands into the surrounding vacuum. McDonnell et al. (1997a)
ﬁnd an empirical formula for evaluation of charge production during an hyper-
velocity impact. This equation, rearranged in order to emphasize projectiles
dimensions and densities, can be written as:

(5)
where δ is the meteoroid density [kg/m3], r is the meteoroid radius [m] and V
its speed [km/s].

Q ≃ 3.04δ1.02r3.06V 3.48

[C]

Because of the energy range, the plasma production is related to chemical
composition of meteoroid. Cometary streams, richer of low ionization potential
elements, will be more dangerous than other. The Leonid meteoroid stream
results to be the most dangerous stream, even during normal condition (Mc-
Donnell et al., 1997a).

The impact-produced plasma can disturb the satellite in several ways:
if
directly injected into circuits can destroy part of the onboard electronics (Mc-
Donnell et al., 1997a); thermal forces can magnetize the neighbourhood of
craters (Cerroni and Martelli, 1982); electromagnetic radiations emitted from
the plasma can disturb several resources or scientiﬁc experiments on the satellite
(Foschini, 1998). Even if satellites are actually submitted to several procedures
for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), meteoroid impacts call for new stud-
ies on these arguments. For example, the plasma-generated charge can deposit
on near surfaces and, subsequently discharges to mass. The pulse shape will
depend on electric characteristics (resistance, inductivity, capacity) of employed
materials. Moreover, the pulse can disturb the onboard electronics, mainly in
four ways (Audone, 1993; Foschini and Gallerani, 1993):

1. the discharge can be directly injected into a circuit;

2. the discharge can hit a nearly surface and disturb a circuit by a secondary

discharge;

3. capacitive coupling between the discharge electric ﬁeld and the circuit;

4. inductive coupling between the discharge magnetic ﬁeld and the circuit.

If the ﬁrst two modes are localized, and then depend on the impact place,
the third and fourth modes can disturb distant components. However, these
coupling eﬀects are strongly non-linear and depending on circuit layout. Thus,
more detailed studies can be made on speciﬁc satellite only.

5 Conclusions

The threat from meteoroids must be revised, taking into account experiences
such as Olympus and experimental studies (McDonnell et al., 1997a). Mechani-
cal damages are localized, sporadically hit important parts and the catastrophic
impact is an event still rare. On the other hand, if the plasma charge and current
production are considered, then the risk increase and meteoroid streams, partic-
ularly those composed with low ionization potential elements, can be dangerous
even during normal conditions. More studies about electromagnetic interfer-
ences from impact-produced plasmas are required.

The nonlinear dynamics of collisionless Alfv`en trains, including resonant particle eﬀects is studied
using the kinetic nonlinear Schr¨odinger (KNLS) equation model. Numerical solutions of the KNLS
reveal the dynamics of Alfv´en waves to be sensitive to the sense of polarization as well as the angle
of propagation with respect to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. The combined eﬀects of both wave
nonlinearity and Landau damping result in the evolutionary formation of stationary S- and arc-
polarized directional and rotational discontinuities. These waveforms are freqently observed in the
interplanetary plasma.

Numerous satellite observations of magnetic activity
in the solar wind have exhibited the nonlinear nature
of MHD waves [1,2]. Recent observations indicate the
existence of directional (DD) and rotational (RD) dis-
continuities, i.e. regions of rapid phase jumps where the
amplitude also varies [1,3], which are thought to be a re-
sult of the nonlinear development and evolution of MHD
waves. Several types of RD/DDs which might be dis-
tinguished by their phase portraits have been observed.
There are (i) discontinuities of the “S-type”, at which
the magnetic ﬁeld vector rotates ﬁrst through an angle
less than or approaching 90◦ in one direction, followed
by rotation in the opposite direction through an angle
larger than 180◦ (typically, 180◦ < ∆φ ≤ 270◦) [3,4],
and (ii) arc-polarized discontinuities, where the magnetic
ﬁeld vector rotates along an arc through an angle less
than 180◦ [1,5]. At DDs, the fast phase jump is accom-
panied by moderate amplitude modulation (δB ∼ B).
At RDs, the amplitude modulation is small or negligible
(δB ≪ B).

The envelope dynamics of nonlinear Alfv´en waves at
small-β are thought to be governed by the derivative
nonlinear Schr¨odinger (DNLS) equation, which describes
parametric coupling with acoustic modes [6]. The theory
of nondissipative Alfv´en waves governed by the conser-
vative DNLS equation predicts nonlinear wave steepen-
ing and formation of waveforms with steep fronts. Thus,
spiky, many-soliton structures are emitted from the steep
edge. It was shown that the nonlinear wave relaxes to a
shock train and constant-B RDs where the ﬁeld rotates
through exactly 180◦ [6,7], when the linear damping due
to ﬁnite plasma conductivity is taken into account. In-
spite of this, the DNLS theory was unable to explain
the existence and dynamics of both (i) the S-polarized
DDs and RDs and (ii) arc-polarized RDs, with rotation
of less than 180◦.
It is believed (and conﬁrmed by re-
cent particle code simulations [8–10]) that the dynam-
ics of Alfv´en waves in the β ∼ 1, isothermal solar wind
plasma are intrinsically dissipative, on account of Landau
damping of ion-acoustic oscillations [16,17]. We should
comment here, that particle code simulations (e.g, Refs.

[8–10]) model “microscopic” behavior of plasma particle
motions, thus may be refered to as “numerical experi-
ments”. A numerical solution of a “macroscopic” evo-
lution equation is a complementary way which allows to
get a theoretical insight into the underlying physics and
theoretically explain the observed (experimental) data.

The dynamics of magnetic ﬁelds in the solar wind has
been extensively investigated using diﬀerent analytical
approaches. Various (e.g., beat, modulational, decay) in-
stabilities of Alfv´en waves were shown [11] to be sensitive
to the wave polarization and the value of plasma β. The
turbulence-based linear model which describes the radial
evolution of magnetic ﬂuctuations in the solar wind was
successfully developed [12] taking into account the eﬀects
of advection and solar wind expansion, along with mix-
ing eﬀects. The simple nonlinear noisy-KNLS model of
turbulence was proposed and investigated in [13]. Arc-
polarized waves, which had been ﬁrst discussed in [14],
were explained [15] via coupling of obliquely propagat-
ing circular Alfv´en waves and a driven fast/slow wave.
Some damping is necessary in this case in order to (con-
sistently) select the arc-type solutions.

In this paper, we use a recently developed [17] analyti-
cal model of the kinetic DNLS (KNLS) equation to inves-
tigate the inﬂuence of Landau damping on the (strongly)
nonlinear dynamics of Alfv´en waves. The main claim of
this paper is that all the discontinuous wave structures
discussed above are distinct solutions of the same simple
analytical model for diﬀerent initial conditions, e.g. ini-
tial wave polarization and wave propagation angle. One
should note that the term which describes the resonant
particle eﬀect is usually integral (nonlocal) in nature, on
account of the ﬁnite ion transit time through the envelope
modulation of an Alfv´en train. Thus, the envelope evolu-
tion equation obtained is a nonlocal, integro-diﬀerential
equation which is not amenable to analytical solution.
We should comment here a case which extends the tra-
ditional paradigm of shock waveforms. There are two
known types of shocks, namely (i) collisional (hydrody-
namic) shocks, in which nonlinear steepening is limited
by collisional (viscous) dissipation, which sinks energy

1

from small scales and (ii) collisionless shocks (common
in astrophysical plasma), in which nonlinear steepening
is limited by dispersion, resulting in the formation of
soliton-type structures with energy content in high-k har-
monics. We add a new class of shock, namely (iii) dissipa-
tive structures (which also can be referred to as collision-
less dissipative shocks), for which nonlinear steepening
is limited by collisionless (scale independent, i.e., acting
on all scales) damping. They emerge only from quasi-
parallel, (nearly) linearly polarized waves. Of course,
to obtain familiar shock-like wave forms, the cyclotron
damping at large-k must be incorporated, as usual for
collisionless shocks.

and Ωi are the Alfv´en speed and proton ion-cyclotron fre-

tion was solved for periodic boundary conditions using a
b
predictor-corrector scheme and a fast Fourier transform,
1024 harmonics and spatial points were taken. The di-
mensionless spatial coordinate and time were introduced
respectively as ζ = z/¯z and τ = te/¯t, where ¯z = 50c/ωp
and ¯t = 200/Ωi. For β = 0, kinetics do not impact the
wave dynamics [17], so Eq. (1) reduces to the familiar
DNLS equation (M1 = 0.5, M2 = 0). The DNLS is inte-
grable and has an exact (soliton) solution. The test run
has shown an excellent agreement with the analytical so-
lution during the time of computation (up to τ = 40, i.e.
8,000 cyclotron periods).

High-amplitude magnetic perturbations in plasmas
typically evolve from small-amplitude (linear) ones. Thus
the most general approach is to examine the nonlinear
evolution of ﬁnite-amplitude periodic waves of diﬀerent
polarizations. The initial wave proﬁles are given by two
initially excited Fourier harmonics, bk. For linear polar-
izations, we pick bk’s equal b−1 = b1 = 1, all others are
zeroes, for circular polarizations we pick b−2 = b−1 = 1,
for elliptical polarizations, we pick b−1 = 1.1, b1 = 0.9.
Thus, the waves are left-hand polarized. Results of a ref-
erence run for β = 0, with amplitude modulated linear
polarization (the circular polarization and oblique propa-
gation cases look similar) are shown in Fig. 1a. The wave
exhibits the nonlinear steepening phase of a front at early
imes (τ ∼ 2). Dispersion further limits steepening and
produces (at times τ ∼ 5) small-scale, oscillatory, cir-
cularly polarized wave structures (even for initial linear
polarization). Signiﬁcant high harmonic energy content
is generated. At later times, τ ∼ 40 (not shown), non-
linear processes result in a wave magnetic ﬁeld which is

completely irregular, indicating strong, large-amplitude
Alfv´enic turbulence.

For β 6= 0, we ﬁrst compare the waveform proﬁles and
harmonic energy spectra obtained from the KNLS with
the previous case. From now on, β = 1 and Te = Ti
(M1 = 0.75, M2 = −0.83) unless stated otherwise. Fig.
1b depicts the time evolution of a parallel propagating
wave with the same initial conditions. In contrast to the
β = 0 case, localized quasi-stationary structures are seen
to form very rapidly, the formation time is τf ∼ 2. The
harmonic spectrum of the dissipative structures (also re-
ferred to as S-type DDs, see below) is narrow, indicating
that energy accumulates in low-k harmonics, i.e., at large
scales. It worth while to emphasize the quasi-stationary
character of such waveforms. They preserve their shape
for thousands cyclotron periods and thus may be indenti-
ﬁed as “structures”. Meanwhile, the wave energy decays
strongly, as seen from Fig. 2. Thus, the dissipative struc-
tures emerge via the competition of nonlinear steepen-
ing of the wave and scale invariant collisionless damping.
The fact that energy dissipates in the dissipative struc-
tures (and not somewhere inbetween) is readily seen from
H[const] ≡ 0.
the simple fact that
b

Fig. 3 is a snapshot of the dissipative structures at
τ = 15 which emerged from a quasi-parallel, linearly po-
latized wave. It is seen that regions of signiﬁcant ﬁeld
variations are accompanied by fast phase rotation. How-
ever, in the regions of negligibly varying |b|, linear polar-
ization is preserved. The dissipative structures exhibit an
easily distinguishable “S-shaped” phase portrait, namely
that at the discontinuity (solid path A-B-C), the mag-
netic ﬁeld vector completes a rotation through π radians.
During the subsequent quescent region (path C-D), the
magnetic ﬁeld vector resides at the “tip” of the left arm
indicating pure linear polarization. At the next disconti-
nuity, the vector returns to the initial position, similarly
completing a π radian rotation as shown by the dashed
path. Thus, the KNLS dissipative structures have the
requisite properties of localized, RDs/DDs, as recently
observed in the solar wind [3,4]. Note, however, these
KNLS RDs are associated with the regions of varying |b|,
unlike the conventional deﬁnition that |b| = const across
the RD. There is no sharp diﬀerence between an RD and
a (weak) DD. One may be transformed into another by
changing the initial wave polarization and propagation
angle. Hence, we use both terms for the S-type KNLS
discontinuity. We should also note the remarkable sim-
ilarity of hodographs obtained by solution of the KNLS
equation and from full numerical plasma simulations [8].
Such KNLS discontinuities occur commonly and are not
restricted to β’s close to unity. These structures are quite
evident in a wide interval of β, of approximately 0.5-0.6
to 1.4-1.6. The dissipative structures still form at smaller
M2, however the formation time increases when M2 de-
creases.

In contrast to the case of linear polarization, circularly
polarized, quasi-parallel waves evolve in a few τ to a sin-

2

gle (almost purely) circularly polarized harmonic at the
lowest k and do not form discontinuities. Energy decay
(Fig. 2) is negligible in the stationary state.

Fig. 4 depicts a snapshot of the quasi-parallel, initially
elliptically polarized wave, an intermediate case between
purely circular and linear polarizations. Sudden phase
jumps (by π radians) which are localized at regions of
varying wave amplitude (typical of linear polarizations)
are easily seen. However, these discontinuities are not
accompanied by wave amplitude discontinuities. Thus,
they are the ∆φ = π RDs. Note, these discontinuities
(which are the semi-circles in Fig. 4b) are separated by
extended regions of linear polarization. Energy dissipa-
tion (Fig. 2) is weak, in comparison to the case of linear
polarization.

Obliquely propagating waves are still described by the
KNLS equation. However, a new wave ﬁeld which (for-
mally) contains a perpendicular projection component of
the ambient magnetic ﬁeld should be introduced. As-
suming the ambient ﬁeld lies in x-z-plane, we write the
new ﬁeld as b = (bx + B0 sin Θ + iby)/B0. The nonlinear
evolution of the linearly and highly elliptically polarized
waves is strongly sensitive to the angle between the polar-
ization plane and the plane deﬁned by the ambient mag-
netic ﬁeld vector and the direction of wave propagation.
This angle is set by initial conditions. When this angle is
small, the oscillating wave magnetic ﬁeld has a longitu-
dinal component along the ambient ﬁeld. Thus, we refer
such waves to as longitudinal. In the opposite case, the
wave magnetic ﬁeld oscillates (nearly) perpendicularly to
the ambient ﬁeld. Thus, such waves are called transverse.
Note that this classiﬁcation scheme fails for circularly po-
larized waves, since a polarization plane cannot be deﬁed
in this case.

Fig. 5 shows a typical (quasi-) stationary, arc-polarized
discontinuity which evolved from an obliquely propagat-
ing (Θ ∼ 40◦), amplitude modulated, circularly polar-
ized wave at τ = 40. The discontinuity is associated
with minor (almost negligible) amplitude modulation.
The magnetic ﬁeld vector makes a fast clockwise rotation
through less than π radians (solid path A-B-C). The ends
A and C are connected by a sector of circularly polarized
wave packet (slow counterclockwise rotation in the phase
diagram, along the dashed, perfect arc C-D-A). Circu-
lar polarization is also indicated by the smoothly de-
creasing phase outside the discontinuity (Fig. 5a). Since
|b|2 ≃ const across the discontinuity (as well as for a
pure circularly polarized harmonic), it is nearly decou-
pled from dissipation. Note the remarkable similarity
of this solution of the KNLS equation to the structures
detected in the solar wind and observed in computer sim-
ulations [5,10].

The wave evolution of the linearly polarized, obliquely
propagating, transverse and longitudinal waves diﬀers
drastically. The transverse waves evolve very quickly (in
a few τ ) to form a perfect arc-polarized RD. Energy dis-
sipation is negligibly small in this process. The longi-
tudinal waves instead form two S-type DDs propagating

The

with diﬀerent group velocities. Thus, they can merge
and annihilate each other almost completely, yielding a
small-amplitude, residual magnetic perturbations.
sharp contrast between these

three quasi-
stationary solutions is a direct consequence of the unique
harmonic scaling of collisionless (Landau) dissipation in
the KNLS equation. It is crucial to understand that col-
lisionless damping enters at all k, in contrast to hydro-
dynamic systems where diﬀusion (viscosity) yields dissi-
pation only at large k (i.e. small scales, or steep gradi-
ent regions). However, higher-k harmonics are strongly
damped, which is typical of a phase-mixing process (i.e.
smaller scales mix faster). For quasi-parallel propagat-
ing waves, Landau damping enters symmetrically for +k
and −k spectrum components. It does not change the
symmetry of a spectrum, so that the initial helicity (set
by initial spectrum symmetry) is preserved. Since lin-
ear polarizations have spectra symmetric upon k → −k,
they couple more strongly to dissipation than circular po-
larizations do. Thus, S-polarized discontinuities, which
consist of predominantly two low-k harmonics of nearly
equal amplitude, emerge. For the circularly polarized
wave, the (initial) spectrum is highly asymmetric. Thus,
such a wave evolves to a single harmonic ﬁnal state, which
is, itself, a stationary (and exact) solution of the KNLS
equation (i.e. it experiences no steepening and minimal
damping). No discontinuities emerge in this case. For the
oblique and quasi-perpendicular cases, there is asymme-
try between bx and by components induced by the ambi-
ent magnetic ﬁeld. This allows the formation of a wave
packet with nearly constant |b|2 (i.e., decoupled from dis-
sipation). Such wave packets are the arc-polarized RDs
with ∆φ < π. We should emphasize the fact that since
there is no characteristic dissipation scale in the system,
the ultimate scale of the dissipative structures is set by
dispersion, alone (a l`a collisionless solitons and shock
waves). Accordingly, one can suggest that (given initial
equal populations of isotropically distributed circular and
linear polarizations) quasi-parallel magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctu-
ations will consist of predominantly circularly polarized
waves and lower amplitude S-polarized KNLS DDs, while
oblique perturbations are predominantly arc-polarized
discontinuities, separated by pieces of oppositely circu-
larly polarized waves.

To conclude, the inﬂuence of the eﬀect of Landau
damping was investigated in this paper. (A more com-
plete study will be published elsewhere [18].) A tractable
analytic evolution equation, the KNLS equation, was nu-
merically solved to study nonlinear dynamics of ﬁnite-
amplitude coherent Alfv´enic trains in a β ∼ 1, isother-
mal plasma, natural to the solar wind. Current studies
shows that all the discontinuous wave structures observed
in the solar wind are distinct solutions of the same sim-
ple analytical KNLS model for diﬀerent initial conditions,
e.g. initial wave polarization and wave propagation angle
with no a priori assumptions or special initial conditions
used.

Abstract

We use Vaschy-Buckhingham Theorem as a systematic tool to build
univocal n-dimensional extensions of the electric and gravitational ﬁne
structure constants and show that their ratio is dimensionally invariant.
The results allow us to obtain the relative standard uncertainty on the
three-dimensionality of space as 1.08 10−13.

Keywords: Vaschy-Buckingham Theorem; Dimensionality; Fundamen-

tal Constants

Dimensional Analysis can be considered a cornerstone of the syntaxis of
Physics.
Its axiomatic foundations, now well established, are based on the
structure of a ﬁnite multiplicative group. A fundamental result is the Π or
Vaschy-Buckingham Theorem [1, 2] from which we can infer the existence of a
deﬁnite number of Πs, i. e., independent adimensional quantities, associated to
the physical processes under consideration, expressed as products of dimensional
ones. Fundamental physical theories - Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics
and General Relativity - involve fundamental physical constants: e, the electron
charge, ¯h, the Planck constant, c, the velocity of light and G, the newtonian
gravitational constant. In many applications of those theories, these constants
appear in adimensional multiplicative combinations, such as α = e2/¯hc, the ﬁne
structure constant for electromagnetic interactions introduced by Sommerfeld
when he extended Bohr theory to include elliptical orbits and relativistic eﬀects
in order to explain the observed splitting of the energy levels of hydrogen atoms
in four-dimensional spacetimes, i.e., in spaces with three dimensions.
Its in-
triguing numerical value, ∼ 1/137, has motivated the until now vain search for
its deduction from fundamental principles. The importance of α has inspired
also the construction of analogous ﬁne structure constants involving other in-
teractions [3]. We shall now discuss the dimensionality of space itself. The

connection between the dimensionality of physical space and the mathematical
structure of physical laws was ﬁrst established by Ehrenfest [4, 5] who solved
the n-dimensional Kepler problem showing that stable solutions are possible
only for n = 2 or n = 3. He treated also the stability of the Bohr model of the
atom. This approach was later explored by other authors [6, 7]. An alternative
procedure to the stability arguments has been presented [8]. The idea of using
nointeger dimensionalities and measuring ǫ, the deviation from the usual three-
dimensionality, according to Jammer [9] was ﬁrst proposed by Zeilinger and
Svozil [10] who analyzed the experimentally measured values of the anomalous
magnetic moment of the electron. It has also been suggested that M¨ossbauer
eﬀect could be used to measure ǫ, in a Pound-Rebka device, by using the gravi-
tational redshift [11]. Now, to deﬁne our problem we introduce and interpret Π
numbers associated to interactions in n-dimensional spaces, using the M, L, T
basis.

By Vaschy-Buckingham Theorem, given i physical quantities ai, with k in-

dependent dimensions, we can deﬁne i − k adimensional Π numbers [12]

Πj =

ak+j
...a

rk+j
k

This allows us to elect each ak+j as a directive quantity according to the phys-
ical process under study. Directive quantities physically guide the construc-
tion of Π numbers and correspond to Buckingham’s derived quantities [1]. In
n-dimensional physical spaces, c, a ratio between space and time, and ¯h, re-
lated to unidimensional oscillators (the only possible unidimensional structure),
maintain their dimensional formulas LT −1 and M L2T −1, respectively. From a
similarity principle1, we obtain the n-dimensional Laplace Equation whose solu-
tion yields interactions proportional to 1/L(n−1). Then, if we preserve, also by a
similarity principle, Newton’s second law as second derivative of displacement,
by the Dimensional Homogeneity Principle, a straightforward calculation shows
that the n-dimensional newtonian gravitational and electromagnetic constants,
Gn and en, have as dimensional formulas LnM −1T −2 and M LnT −2.

Let us consider now en, ¯h, c, Gn and, as the gravitational “charge”, the
proton mass mp. As we have a three-dimensional basis and ﬁve quantities,
by the Vaschy-Buckingham Theorem, we can construct only two independent
Π numbers. Interactions are always given by the product of their character-
istic charges. This leads us necessarily to choose en
p as the directive
quantities. Then, Eq. (1) gives us

2 and m2

Πq = [¯h]ǫ1 [Gn]ǫ2 [c]ǫ3 q2,

where q represents the charges. The solutions of the respective systems are

Without the Vaschy-Buckingham Theorem, we could not have obtained these
univocal solutions. The remarkable singularity at n = 1 appears also in the n-
dimensional extension of the Planck scales [13]. Note that complex structures
only can be built from interactions if open or closed orbits can exist. This is
possible only for n > 1.

Projeting Πen and Πmp in a space with three dimensions, i. e., for n = 3,

we have

Πen (n=3) =

The above result shows that the Π numbers given by (3) and (4) are adi-
mensional quantities obtained from a systematic use for interacting charges
of Vaschy-Buckingham Theorem, satisfying Laplace Equation in n-dimensions,
that reduces, respectively, to α and its gravitational analogue αG for n = 3.
It can be concluded that these Πs are in fact the generalized ﬁne structure
constants αn and αGn. This interpretation and the fact that for n 6= 3 it is
impossible to construct an adimensional quantity with only en, ¯h and c suggest
indeed that gravitation may play a relevant role in atomic structure for n 6= 3.
Barrow and Tipler [14] presented one among the inﬁnite possible adimen-
sional combinations of the four fundamental n-dimensional constants the num-
n−1 as the n-spatial dimensionless constant
ber α
n
of Nature. In this beautiful approach, which however does not contemplate the
Vaschy-Buckingham Theorem, the singularity at n = 1 disappears and for n =
1, 2, 3 and 4 each one of the fundamental constants is absent.

In the interval [0, 1[ the value of αn begins at 10194 and diverges positively.
Figure (1) shows the extreme sensibility of αn and αGn on n in the interval
]1, 10]. Only in a very short neighborhood of n = 3, αn ∼ 1 (for example α2 ∼
10−68, α4 ∼ 1019 and αn = 1 at n ∼ 3.067). So, the error on the experimental
value of α yields the narrow range in which we can ﬁnd the dimensionality of
the space in which we live.

In addition, the ratio between αn and αGn is a constant given by e2

= e2/(Gm2
electric and gravitational forces plays a major role - such as planets [16],[3]
- there are parameters - such as planetary radii - insensitive to dimensional
change. This fact has deep astronomical, physical and biological implications.
Note that, if the dimensionality of space had evolved as a function of time,
the ﬁne tuning of electromagnetic interactions at atomic and molecular levels,
necessary to the existence of life, could not be maintained. As a ﬁnal remark, we
note that the relative standard uncertainty of 3.7 × 10−9 on the experimental
value of α [15] implies a relative standard uncertainty of 1.08 10−13 on the
three-dimensionality of the physical space.

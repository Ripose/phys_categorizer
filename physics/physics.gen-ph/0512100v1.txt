Abstract

We have calculated the momentum distributions of nanoparticles in diffrac-

tion and interference dependent on the effective screening mass parameter
or size parameter and presented the calculations for a nanoparticle inside
an inﬁnite square potential well and for a tunnelling nanoparticle through
a square potential barrier. These results display the transition from quan-
tum to classical mechanics and the simultaneous wave-particle duality of
nanoparticles. The concept that the effective screening effect increases with
increasing size of an object paves way for development of nanomechanics
and nanotechnology.

1 Introduction

It is well known that there is a gap between quantum and classical mechanics.
Nanomechanics is required for the development of nanotechnology that was pro-
posed ﬁrst in 1959 by Richard Feynman [1]. Now it becomes possible to ﬁnd way
to bridge the gap due to the understanding of quantum reality and interference
phenomena as presented in Ref.[2]. In the article a particle is described as a non-
spreading wave packet satisfying a linear equation within the framework of special
relativity and quantum interference experiments are explained with a hypothesis
that there is a coupling interaction between the peaked and non-peaked pieces of
the wave packet. It has also been mentioned that concerning a macroscopic object,
for example, a tiny grain of sand, roughly speaking, because the outer matter in it,

1

like a barrier, screens nearly completely the off-peak part of the inner matter, the
diffraction and interference of the grains fundamentally do not take place when
they pass through slits. The concept that the effective screening effect increases
with increasing size of an object gives a logical description of transition from
quantum to classical mechanics and paves way for development of nanomechan-
ics and nanotechnology. This article will present some typical consequences of
the concept to display the transition and the simultaneous wave-particle duality of
nanoparticles. The explanation of the transition in terms of environment-induced
decoherence proposed by such as Zurek [3] seems to be untenable.

2 Diffraction and interference of nanoparticles

A grain of matter in size larger than 100 nm is generally considered as a macro-
scopic object and a particle up to 1 nm as a perfect quantum particle such as
fullerene C60 [4].
In order to illustrate the behavior of nanoparticles we con-
sider a spherical nanoparticle as a model as shown in Fig.1(a). Let m denote

the mass of the effective screening layer, M the total mass and α = m/M the
effective screening mass parameter (ESMP). Furthermore, let ρ denote the aver-
age mass density of the spherical nanoparticle, rM the radius of the nanoparticle
and rm the thickness of the effective screening layer, so M = 4πr3
M ρ/3 and

size parameter (ESSP) is

Since the thickness of the screening layer having quantum behavior can be as-
sumed to have a value around a certain value, say 5 nm, the larger the size of the
nanoparticle is, the more it is like a classical particle. Now we can investigate
diffraction of nanoparticles from a single slit and interference from a double slit
in terms of the screening effect.

2.1 Diffraction of nanoparticles from a single slit

Assuming that x axis is perpendicular to a slit in the slit plane and z axis perpen-
dicular to the slit plane, according to quantum mechanics, if the wave function at
the slit is ψ(x), the diffraction of a particle can be calculated by using the Fourier
transformation [5]

φ(px) =

1
√2π¯h Z

exp(

ipxx

)ψ(x)dx

The momentum of the diffracted particle is

p =

m2vz

2 + px

where vz is the velocity component of the particle along z axis. For a nanoparticle
with the ESMP α, its momentum is

2.2 Interference of nanoparticles from a double slit

The normalized momentum distributions of the nanoparticle with different values
of α in the double slit interference are calculated in the same way as above for the
single slit. The distributions P (p(α)
x ) are shown in Fig.4. We see the width of the
distribution decreases to its classical limit as α
0. Clearly, the diffraction of
nanoparticles from a grating can be calculated in the same way.

The patterns of the single slit diffraction and double slit interference can be
calculated from the momentum distributions if the momentum (mv) of the nanopar-
ticle and the distance between the slit screen and the detector screen are given.

3 Nanoparticle inside an inﬁnite square potential well

Consider an inﬁnite square potential well of width L, that is, the potential function

As seen in any quantum mechanics textbooks, the quantized energy and normal-
ized wave function of a particle of mass m in the well are

The Fourier transformation of Eq.15 yields the momentum wave functions

φn(p) =

Now, for a nanoparticle with the ESMP α, let p’ denote the momentum of the
effective screening layer. Substituting p′/α for p into Eq.16 yields

Θn(p′, α) =

1

exp(

ip′x

(17)

Thus, we have the normalized momentum distribution

4 Tunnelling of nanoparticles

With regard to tunnelling effects, we consider a particle with momentum Mv and
kinetic energy E = Mv2/2 passing through or over a one-dimensional square
potential barrier of height U0 and thickness L. According to quantum mechanics,
its wave function can be split into three parts:

ψ(x) = exp(ikx) + √ρ exp(

ikx), x < 0, k =

ψ(x) = √τ exp(ik), x > L

As seen in any quantum mechanics textbooks, for the case where E > U0, the
transmission coefﬁcient is

τ = [1 +

4E(E

and for E < U0, substituting iκ for κ into Eq.21, the transmission coefﬁcient is

τ = [1 +

The reﬂection coefﬁcient is

Now we are going to calculate the transmission coefﬁcient and reﬂection coef-
ﬁcients of a nanoparticle with the ESMP α. Since the momentum of the effective
screening layer is k(α)¯h = αk¯h outside the barrier and κ(α)¯h = ακ¯h inside the
barrier, we have to substitute k(α)/α for k and κ(α)/α for κ into the wave func-
tions. Clearly the substitution is equivalent to substituting α¯h for ¯h. So, for the
case where E > U0, we obtain the transmission coefﬁcient

The reﬂection coefﬁcient is

For example, for the case where E = 1 and U0 = 2, taking L = 1 and M =
0.1, 0.5, 1.0, the transmission coefﬁcient curves τ (α, M) are shown in Fig.6(a). If
taking M = 1.0 and L = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, the curves τ (α, L) are shown in Fig.6(b).
Here we have taken ¯h = 1 in the natural unit. We see the transmission coefﬁcients
approach to their classical limits as α

0.

5 Uncertainty relations for nanoparticles

In 1927, Heisenberg stated: “the more precisely the position is determined, the
less precisely the momentum is known in this instant, and vice vera.” [6] This
rule is known as Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Its physical reasoning has been
offered in Ref.[2]. The principle is basically formulated by the relation

Now, for a nanoparticle with the ESMP α, since
Fig.1(b), the Heisenberg relation becomes

Figs.3-6 illustrate the momentum uncertainty of nanoparticles, which decreases
with decreasing α. We would have similar energy-time, angle momentum-angle
and other uncertainty relations. Thus the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is in
some degree dependent on α applicable to nanoparticles and completely unap-
plicable to macroscopic objects. The fact that the momentum and position are
exactly measurable in classical physics reﬂects the limit α
0, instead of wrong
0. It is a logical mistake to regard ¯h as a variable instead of a deﬁnite
limit ¯h

constant.

6 Conclusion

We have calculated the momentum distributions of nanoparticles in diffraction
and interference dependent on the effective screening mass parameter or size pa-
rameter and presented the calculations for a nanoparticle inside an inﬁnite square
potential well and for a tunnelling nanoparticle through a square potential bar-
rier. These results display the transition from quantum to classical mechanics and
the simultaneous wave-particle duality of nanoparticles. The concept that the ef-
fective screening effect increases with increasing size of an object paves way for
development of nanomechanics and nanotechnology.

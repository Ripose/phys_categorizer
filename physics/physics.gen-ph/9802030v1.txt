Abstract

We present an approach to understanding the origin of inertia involving the electromagnetic component
of the quantum vacuum and propose this as a step toward an alternative to Mach’s principle. Preliminary
analysis of the momentum ﬂux of the classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation impinging on accelerated
objects as viewed by an inertial observer suggests that the resistance to acceleration attributed to inertia
may be at least in part a force of opposition originating in the vacuum. This analysis avoids the ad hoc
modeling of particle-ﬁeld interaction dynamics used previously by Haisch, Rueda and Puthoﬀ (Phys. Rev.
A 49, 678, 1994) to derive a similar result. This present approach is not dependent upon what happens
at the particle point, but on how an external observer assesses the kinematical characteristics of the zero-
point radiation impinging on the accelerated object. A relativistic form of the equation of motion results
from the present analysis. Its manifestly covariant form yields a simple result that may be interpreted as
a contribution to inertial mass. We note that our approach is related by the principle of equivalence to
Sakharov’s conjecture (Sov. Phys. Dokl. 12, 1040, 1968) of a connection between Einstein action and the
vacuum. The argument presented may thus be construed as a descendant of Sakharov’s conjecture by which
we attempt to attribute a mass-giving property to the electromagnetic component — and possibly other
components — of the vacuum. In this view the physical momentum of an object is related to the radiative
momentum ﬂux of the vacuum instantaneously contained in the characteristic proper volume of the object.
The interaction process between the accelerated object and the vacuum (akin to absorption or scattering of
electromagnetic radiation) appears to generate a physical resistance (reaction force) to acceleration suggestive
of what has been historically known as inertia.

I. INTRODUCTION

As discussed recently by Vigier [1], “the origin and nature of inertial forces. . . can be considered as an
unsolved mystery in modern physics. It still sits, like Banco’s ghost, at any banquet of natural philoso-
phers.” The instantaneous opposition to acceleration of all material objects is conventionally assumed to
be a universal property of matter known as inertia. Historically there have been two views on the origin
of inertial mass. It has been assumed to be either an inherent internal property of matter capable of no
further explanation, or, in the view of Mach, a property that somehow originates externally in a collective
linkage among all matter in the universe. This last, often referred to as Mach’s principle, may be exempliﬁed
in a thought experiment. Rotation is a form of acceleration. The inertia of matter manifests itself in the
existence of centrifugal (and Coriolis) forces in the reference frame of a rotating object. Imagine a universe
containing only a single object. In the view of Mach it would be an absurdity to claim that, in an otherwise
empty universe, this object is capable of rotation. This would imply that centrifugal (and Coriolis) forces
could not manifest and that therefore the single object in an empty universe should be devoid of inertia. If
a single external object is now introduced, the phenomenon of rotation, by virtue of external reference, is
again possible and the inertia of the rotating object should reappear. This allows the interpretation that the
external object is the cause of the inertia of the rotating object. However it would be unphysical to assume
that any external object no matter how minute should be capable of creating all at once the “full inertia”
in the rotating object that it would otherwise possess in the “standard” universe. It can thus be argued in
the Machian view that inertia must be an asymptotic function of surrounding matter that would gradually
come into being as the universe is ﬁlled around the object in question.

A rigorous and quantitative formulation of Mach’s principle has never been successfully developed [2].
A tentative attempt by Sciama [3] to quantify Mach’s principle by associating inertial mass generation
with a vector extension of the gravitational potential (analogous to a gravitation current) resulted in a
prediction that was later shown to be inconsistent with experimental evidence. In the Sciama formulation, the
asymmetrical distribution of surrounding matter in the Milky Way should result in a directional dependence
of inertial mass with respect to galactic coordinates as measurable in a laboratory, this amounting to a
variation on the order of ∆m/m = 10−7 whereas the experiments of Hughes and Drever subsequently
indicated that ∆m/m ≤ 10−20 [4].

That general relativity is not Machian is exempliﬁed by the fact that it is possible to formulate so-
lutions of the ﬁeld equations for an empty universe and for a rotating universe. Recent examination on
the relationship of the Lense-Thirring eﬀect with general relativity further demonstrates the absence of a
clear relationship and possible inconsistency between Mach’s principle and general relativity [5]. Additional
conﬂicts between general relativity and Mach’s principle are presented by Vigier [1].

The Machian view would imply that it is entirely arbitrary whether one regards acceleration as motion
(or rotation) of the object in question or as counter-motion (or counter-rotation) of the rest of the universe.
However because the inertia reaction force occurs at the same instant that acceleration is applied to an object
it becomes causally awkward to explain how Mach’s principle could be accommodated without the need
for instantaneous propagation of some kind of back-reaction ﬁeld involving inﬁnite velocity, thus violating
relativity and causality [6]. Preservation of causality is, of course, a strong argument for ﬁnding a basis of
inertia that involves locally-originating forces and interactions. The approach of Vigier [1] is to ﬁnd such a
non-Machian basis in local interactions of a real Dirac subquantum aether model stemming from Einstein-
de Broglie-Bohm causal stochastic quantum mechanics. The view presented herein substitutes for Mach’s
principle in identifying the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the quantum vacuum as the external causative agent of
inertia by providing a locally-originating reaction force. Limitations of treatment allow us to show this only
for the electromagnetic vacuum, leaving the contributions of other vacuum ﬁelds for further extensions of
the theory. An example of a contribution by other vacuum ﬁelds is precisely the one recently presented by
Vigier [1].

The original development of this idea [7] proposed that the inertial property of matter could originate
in Lorentz-force interactions between electromagnetically interacting particles at the level of their most

2

fundamental components (e.g., electrons and quarks) and the quantum vacuum (QV) [8]. This general idea
is a descendent of a conjecture of Sakharov for the case of Einstein action [9] that can be extended by the
principle of equivalence to the case of inertia. The approach of stochastic electrodynamics (SED) was used
in [7] to study the classical dynamics of a highly idealized model of a fundamental particle constituent of
matter (that contained a “parton”, i.e., a surrogate for a very fundamental particle component) responding
to the driving forces of the so-called electromagnetic zero-point ﬁeld (ZPF), the classical analog of the QV.

Reservations can be raised about the proposal of [7], for example: (a) the complexity, in that the
analysis of the classical charged particle-ZPF dynamics involved an extensive calculational development
which complicated the assessment of the physical validity of the approach; and (b) the introduction of ad
hoc dynamical models for the interaction of the ﬁeld and matter particularly at very high frequencies. Among
these dynamical assumptions there were two of clear concern: (i) the idealized representation of a particle as
a “parton” (Planck oscillator) and (ii) the use of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation as the starting
point (the ALD equation originates in Newton’s Laws). Details on problems with the development in [7] will
be discussed in [10].

Consequently the primary purpose of the present paper is to outline a simple approach which avoids
some of these model-related issues by examining how an opposing ﬂux of radiative energy and momentum
should arise under natural and suitable assumptions in an accelerated frame from the viewpoint of an inertial
observer without regard to details of particle-ﬁeld dynamics, i.e., independently of any dynamical models
for particles. As the details of particle-ﬁeld interactions are not of concern in the present case, the use
of the classical electromagnetic ZPF formalism of SED looks quite natural. Using standard relativistic
transformations for the electromagnetic ﬁelds, it is argued that upon acceleration a time rate of change of
momentum density or momentum ﬂux will arise out of the ZPF in the proper volume of any accelerating
object, and that this turns out to be directed against and linearly proportional to the acceleration (Sec. II,
III, IV and V). This arises after evaluation of the ZPF momentum density (Sec. IV, V) as it appears at a given
point in an accelerated frame S, to an independent inertial laboratory observer due to transformations of the
ﬁelds from the observer’s inertial laboratory reference frame I∗, to another inertial frame Iτ , instantaneously
comoving with the object (Sec. II) and from the viewpoint of the observer in the laboratory inertial frame
I∗. Absorption or scattering of this radiation by the accelerated charged particle is found to result in a
force opposing the acceleration, yielding an f = ma relation for subrelativistic motions. We follow standard
notation in using f to refer to a three-force, and F = γf to refer to the corresponding space part of the
relativistic four-force; cf. Eq. (9). The relativistic form of the force expression is obtained in Appendix D
and presented in Sec. VI. For the execution of this development we again assume hyperbolic motion [7, 11,
12] (i.e., constant proper acceleration). Extension to an arbitrary accelerated motion is readily envisioned
(Sec. VII). Section VIII concludes the paper. Important details or elaborations, extensions, and reﬁnements
are left for the appendices (A, B, C and D).

What we tentatively propose here is that when an object of rest mass m receives an impulse and is

thereby accelerated by an external agent, the following two features deserve special attention.

(1) The scattering of the incoming ZPF ﬂux within the object is what generates a reaction force hereto-
fore attributed solely to the existence of an unexplained property called inertia. This clearly must be directed
opposite to the direction of acceleration. As shown below this reaction force will turn out to be proportional
to the acceleration a but in opposite direction to it, f zp ∼ −a. If there were an ideal body acting as a “perfect
absorber”, i.e, capable of interacting with all the incoming ﬂux of momentum from the ZPF up to the highest
frequencies, an enormous maximum total reaction force would appear. In the case of a more realistic but still
idealized body of characteristic proper volume V0 that intercepts only a certain proportion η of the radiation
(0 < η < 1), owing to this opacity there appears a reaction force on the body of the form f zp ∼ −V0ηa.
The eﬀect should clearly be larger for bodies of larger volume V0 and/or such that η, the matter-radiation
coupling coeﬃcient, is larger. In this interpretation inertial mass becomes a function of such opacity. As the
SED classical ZPF background is such a large reservoir of energy, this phenomenological coupling coeﬃcient
η can be extremely small for a substantial eﬀect to still appear. We do not concern ourselves in this paper
with the nature or strength of η, i.e., we omit consideration of the detailed dynamics of interaction of the ZPF

3

with matter in general or with material particles in particular. We report only on the necessary existence of
a force of opposition by the ZPF as characterized by a change in the electromagnetic momentum density to
the accelerated motion of the object without any concern for the details of the particle-radiation interaction
embodied in the eﬃciency factor η.

(2) After the acceleration process is completed, from the point of view of an inertial observer attached to
the stationary laboratory frame there appears associated with the body in motion a net ﬂux of momentum
density in the surrounding ZPF. In other words, on calculating the ZPF momentum contained in the object
as referenced to the observer’s own inertial frame, the observer would conclude that a certain amount of
momentum is instantaneously contained within the proper volume, V0, of the moving object. This momentum
is directly related to what would normally be called the physical momentum of the object. Calculated with
respect to its own frame the object itself would ﬁnd no net ZPF momentum contained within itself, consistent
with the view that one’s own momentum is necessarily always zero.

II. ZERO-POINT FIELD AND HYPERBOLIC MOTION

In the following we reference a small (in a sense to be speciﬁed below) and accelerated “object” consisting
of elementary “particles” contained within a small volume. The term “object” can refer to either such a
spatially extended but small entity or, in the context of reference frames, to its central point. We assume a
non-inertial frame of reference, S, accelerated in such a way that the acceleration a as seen from an object
ﬁxed to a speciﬁc point, namely (c2/a, 0, 0), in the accelerated system, S, remains constant, i.e., the point
(c2/a, 0, 0) is uniformly accelerated. Such condition leads as in [7, 11] to the well-known case of hyperbolic
motion [12]. We again represent the classical electromagnetic ZPF in the traditional form and assume the
same three reference systems I∗, Iτ , and S as in [7] and originally introduced in [11]. I∗ is the inertial
laboratory frame. S is the accelerated frame in which the object is placed at rest at the point (c2/a, 0, 0). τ
is the object proper time as measured by a clock located at this same object point (c2/a, 0, 0) of S. Iτ is an
inertial system whose (c2/a, 0, 0) point at proper time τ exactly (but only instantaneously) coincides with
the object point of S. The acceleration of this (c2/a, 0, 0) point of S is a as measured from Iτ . Hyperbolic
motion is deﬁned such that a is the same for all proper times τ as measured in the corresponding Iτ frames
at a point (c2/a, 0, 0) that in each one of these Iτ frames instantaneously comoves and coincides with the
corresponding object point, namely (c2/a, 0, 0) of S. At proper time τ = 0 this object point of the S-system
also instantaneously coincides with the (c2/a, 0, 0) point of I∗ and thus I∗= Iτ (τ = 0). We refer to the
observer’s laboratory time in I∗ as t∗, chosen such that t∗ = 0 at τ = 0. For simplicity we let the object
acceleration a at proper time τ take place along the x-direction so that a = aˆx is the same constant vector,
as seen at every proper time τ in every corresponding Iτ system. The acceleration of the (c2/a, 0, 0) point
of S as seen from I∗ is a∗ = γ−3
τ a [12]. Occasionally we refer to S as the Rindler non-inertial frame. We
take it as a “rigid” frame [12]. It can be shown that as a consequence the acceleration a is not the same
for the diﬀerent points of S, but we are only interested in points inside a small neighborhood of the center
of the accelerated object [12]. Speciﬁcally we are interested in a neighborhood of the object’s central point
that contains the object and within which the acceleration is everywhere essentially the same.

Because of the hyperbolic motion [7,11,12], the velocity ux(τ ) = βτ c of the object point ﬁxed in S with

independent elements are indexed by the wavevector k and the polarization index λ (or more technically,

where the zero in the argument of the Iτ ﬁelds, Ezp and Bzp actually means the Iτ spatial point (c2/a, 0, 0).
Here we observe three things. First, we take the ﬁelds that correspond to the ZPF as viewed from every
inertial frame Iτ (whose (c2/a, 0, 0) point coincides with the particle point (c2/a, 0, 0) of S and instantaneously
comoves with the object at the corresponding instant of proper time τ ) to also represent the ZPF viewed
instantaneously and from the single point (c2/a, 0, 0) in S. Note the dependence on the proper time τ of the
object. Second, the corresponding ﬁelds in Iτ are obtained from a simple Lorentz rotation from I∗ into Iτ .
Hence for every proper time τ in the Rindler non-inertial frame, the ﬁelds Ezp and Bzp appear as expanded
in terms of the four-vector (k, k) whose components are the wavevector magnitude k = ω/c and wavevector
k of I∗ [11]. This will prove to be an advantageous simplifying feature that will help in establishing I∗ as
the ultimate reference frame in terms of which everything at the object point in S at any proper time τ is
written.

The third and ﬁnal point is crucial: Though the ﬁelds at the object point in S and in the corresponding
tangential frame Iτ instantaneously coincide, this does not mean that detectors in S and in Iτ will be subject
to the same eﬀect, i.e., experience the same radiation-ﬁeld time evolution. Detectors need time to perform
their measurements: This necessarily involves integration over some interval of time and the evolution of the
ﬁelds in S and in Iτ are obviously diﬀerent. Hence a detector at rest in Iτ and the same detector at rest in
S do not experience the same thing even during a short time interval. (This point touches on the origin of
the Unruh-Davies eﬀect, which is beyond the scope of the present paper.)

Consider any dynamical system such as, for example, a collection of interacting particles: An inﬁnite
number of diﬀerent dynamical states can yield the same instantaneous snapshot of the system conﬁguration
even though the dynamical states of motion may be radically diﬀerent. Two snapshots separated in time
are necessary to distinguish diﬀerences among systems coordinates involving velocities; three will begin to
distinguish accelerations, etc. The state of the system cannot be captured in an exact instant of time, but
rather is a function of the time evolution. Summarizing, while the two ﬁelds, namely that of S and that of
Iτ , are the same at a given space-time point, the evolution of the ﬁeld in S and the evolution of the ﬁeld in
Iτ are by no means the same. Furthermore any ﬁeld or radiation measurements in Iτ and in S both take
some time and are not conﬁned to a single space-time point.

We clarify the notation used in the sense that all polarization components are understood to be scalars,
i.e., directional cosines, but written in the form ˆǫi(k, λ) ≡ ˆǫ · ˆxi, where ˆxi = ˆx, ˆy, ˆz; i = x, y, z. The karat
means that they come from axial projections of the polarization unit vector ˆǫ . We use the same convention
for components of the ˆk unit vector where, e.g., ˆkx denotes ˆk · ˆx. We can select space and time coordinates
and orientation in I∗ such that [11,12]

III. DYNAMICAL SETTING: FORCE OF RESISTANCE TO
ACCELERATED MOTION AND ZPF MOMENTUM FLUX

In 1968 Sakharov [9] published a brief conjecture regarding Einstein action. In this approach the concept
of mass does not arise; objects simply move along geodesics. However one could go on to interpret this as
gravity arising in certain perturbations by massive bodies of the surrounding vacuum ﬁelds, and the principle
of equivalence would then imply that this should extend to inertia. A successful extension to a more general
ﬁeld theory than the one contemplated here would likely suggest that an inertia eﬀect is caused by the
vacuum of that theory, without the need of postulating any additional ﬁeld solely for the purpose of giving
mass to material entities (e.g. a mass-giving Higgs-type ﬁeld).

The objective of the present paper is to study, by a completely diﬀerent approach to that in [7], the
hypothesis that inertial mass may be considered a vacuum eﬀect, i.e., that within the limited context of our
treatment, the parameter m of Newton’s second law (f = ma) can be explained as an eﬀect due to the ZPF,
i.e., that the inertial rest mass can be explained, at least in part, as a coeﬃcient involving the object, its
electromagnetic coupling and other ZPF parameters. This is attempted now not by means of a dynamical
analysis on a very speciﬁc model (as in [7]) but instead by careful examination of the structure of the ﬁelds
viewed in relation to an object being compelled to perform accelerated motion by an external agent. The
goal of such analysis is to ﬁnd an expression and an explanation for the m parameter.

Newton’s second law can be more generally written, but still in its traditional nonrelativistic form, as

which is the limiting form of the space part of the relativistic four-force form of Newton’s law:

which for the case when β → 0 and γ → 1 (corresponding for us to the object in the τ → 0 limit when Iτ
coincides with I∗ and then γτ → 1) becomes

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
Having deﬁned force in his second law as the rate of change of momentum imparted to an object by
an agent, Newton then states in his third law that such a force will result in the creation of an equal and
opposite reaction force back upon the accelerating agent. The concept of inertia becomes then a necessity:
Inertia is thus necessarily attributed to the accelerating object in order to generate the equal and opposite
reaction force upon the agent required by the third law. It is our proposition that resistance from the vacuum
is what physically provides that reaction force. One can interpret this as either the origin of inertia of matter
or as a substitute for the concept of innate inertia of matter. In other words, inertia becomes in a sense a
placeholder for this heretofore undiscovered vacuum-based reaction force which is a necessary requirement
of Newton’s third law. Force is then seen to be a primary concept; inertia is not.

Newton’s third law is essentially a statement about symmetry in nature for contact forces. In the static
case (e.g., pressing one hand against the other), from symmetry alone an applied force f , must necessarily
result in a reaction force fr such that

Inertia as the dynamical extension of this law can be made explicit by writing the f = ma relation as

which makes it clear that inertia as a resistance to acceleration is equivalent to a reaction force of the form

f = −fr.

To recapitulate our argument, Newton’s third law states that if an agent applies a force to a point
on an object, at that point there arises an equal and opposite force back upon the agent. Were this not
the case, the agent would not experience the process of exerting a force and we would have no basis for
mechanics. The law of equal and opposite macroscopic contact forces is thus fundamental both conceptually
and perceptually, but it is legitimate to seek further underlying connections. In the case of a stationary
object (ﬁxed to the earth, say), the equal and opposite macroscopic forces can be said to arise in microscopic
interatomic forces in the neighborhood of the point of contact which act to resist compression. This can
be traced more deeply still to electromagnetic interactions involving orbital electrons of adjacent atoms or
molecules, etc.

A similar experience of equal and opposite forces arises in the process of accelerating (pushing on) an
object. It is an experimental fact that to accelerate an object a force must be applied by an agent and that
the agent will thus experience an equal and opposite force so long as the acceleration continues. We argue
that this equal and opposite force also has a deeper physical cause, which at least in part turns out to also be
electromagnetic and is speciﬁcally due to the scattering or interaction with ZPF radiation. We demonstrate
that from the point of view of a nearby inertial observer there exists a net energy and momentum ﬂux
(Poynting vector) of ZPF radiation transiting the accelerating object in a direction necessarily opposite to
the acceleration vector. The scattering opacity of the object to the transiting ﬂux creates the back-reaction
force customarily called the inertial reaction. Inertia is thus, in part, a special kind of electromagnetic drag
eﬀect, namely one that is acceleration-dependent since only in accelerating frames is the ZPF perceived as
asymmetric. In stationary or uniform-motion frames the ZPF is perfectly isotropic.

As a ﬁrst step we must examine in precise detail how we estimate the change of momentum ∆p implied
in Eq. (9a) before taking the limit. Assume for concreteness that the massive object of rest mass m performs
hyperbolic motion under the action of the external agent with corresponding constant proper acceleration
a along the x-axis so that a = aˆx as in Sec. II. At proper time ∆τ the object is instantaneously at rest
in the inertial coordinate frame I∆τ at the point (c2/a, 0, 0) of that frame. Moreover at the object proper
time τ = 0 (that corresponds to the time t∗ = 0 of I∗), the object was instantaneously detected at rest at
the point (c2/a, 0, 0) of the laboratory inertial frame I∗ by the observer located at that point. After a short
lapse of laboratory time ∆t∗ > 0 that corresponds to the object proper time ∆τ , the object is seen, from the
viewpoint of I∗, to have received from the accelerating agent the amount of impulse or momentum increment
∆p∗. The expression (9a) but as seen in I∗ is thus

f∗ =

dp∗

= lim

∆t∗→0

∆p∗
∆t∗

.

At the corresponding object proper time ∆τ , the object is instantaneously at rest in the comoving inertial
frame I∆τ . Consequently the momentum of the object at proper time ∆τ and as viewed in I∆τ is of course
zero.

As proposed in [7], the force of opposition to the accelerating action imposed by the external agent
does not come from the object itself but from the all-encompassing vacuum which is restrictively represented
herein by only the electromagnetic ZPF. Our goal is to show that if this is so, the force of opposition, fr, in
the subrelativistic case is strictly proportional to the negative of the acceleration, namely to −a, as in Eq.
(12), and can therefore reasonably be interpreted as a contribution to the inertia of the object.

Taking a vacuum-opposition-to-acceleration for granted, but not yet assuming that it is proportional to
−a, it then follows that if the force in Eq. (9a) accelerates the object and if our hypothesis is correct, there
must, from Newton’s third law, be an opposite matching reaction force due to the ZPF, f zp, such that (see
Eq. 12):

(13)

(14)

f zp = fr = −f .

9

The key is to ﬁnd whether f zp will prove, from relativistic electrodynamics, to be proportional to −a.
Actually, this should be true as viewed from any inertial frame whatsoever [14]. To recapitulate the direction
of our argument, we assume in Eq. (13) that, in the sense of Rindler [12], Newton’s second law just provides
a deﬁnition for the force entity. Newtonian mechanics starts at this point, treating Eq. (13) as a postulate
of physics. The equal and opposite force of the object on the pushing agent required by Newton’s third
law is traditionally assumed to be provided by the innate inertia of the accelerating object. Anticipating
that the resistance comes instead from the vacuum, we write this equal and opposite reaction condition
explicitly with the superscript ZP in Eq. (14). When we compare Eqs. (9), (12) and (14), it follows that if
the accelerating agent by means of the force f gives to the object during a time interval ∆τ an impulse or
change of momentum ∆p, there must be a corresponding impulse (change of momentum) ∆pzp provided by
the ZPF in exactly the same time interval and as viewed from the same inertial reference frame but in the
opposite direction to ∆p so that

Hence ∆pzp is the matching reactive counter-impulse given by the ZPF that opposes the impulse ∆p given
by the accelerating agent. We refer both ∆pzp and ∆p to the same inertial frame and in this case to the
laboratory frame I∗ and write

As this momentum change for the object ∆p∗ is calculated with respect to the inertial frame (that conven-
tionally we call the laboratory frame) I∗ and not with respect to any other frame, (e.g., the inertial frame
I∆τ ) it is necessary to calculate the putative ZPF-induced opposing impulse ∆pzp
∗ with respect to the same
inertial frame I∗ (and not with respect to I∆τ or any other frame). We write

∆pzp

∗ = pzp

∗ (∆t∗) − pzp

∗ (0) = pzp

∗ (∆t∗).

The momentum pzp
t∗ = ∆t∗. The last equality follows from symmetry of the ZPF distribution as viewed in I∗ that leads to

∗ (∆t∗) is essentially the integral of dpzp
∗

from I∗-frame time t∗ = 0 to I∗-frame time

In what follows we seek to ﬁnd a mathematical expression for the ZPF-induced inertia reaction force
f zp
∗ . For this purpose it is useful to state that from Newton’s third law and the force deﬁned above we can
write that the following must be true if our hypothesis is correct:

lim
∆t∗→0

∆pzp
∗
∆t∗

∗ = −f∗ = − lim

If the inertia origin propounded here is correct then Eq. (19), at least in the subrelativistic case, should
yield a nonvanishing force f zp
that is parallel to the direction of the acceleration a = aˆx, opposite to it, and
∗
proportional to the acceleration magnitude a = |a|.

IV. INERTIA REACTION FORCE AND THE ZPF MOMENTUM DENSITY

We use Eq.

(19) both to evaluate and deﬁne the eﬀect that we will identify with the ZPF inertia
force f zp
∗ . We concern ourselves in this section with the ZPF momentum ﬂux entering the object. Next,
in Sec. V, we further develop this analysis (with the help of Appendix A) to the point of deriving the
acceleration-dependent f zp

∗ . Finally in Appendix B we analyze the momentum content.

In order to fully grasp the situation we consider the following simple ﬂuid analogy involving as a heuristic
device a constant velocity and a spatially varying density in place of the usual hyperbolic motion through
a uniform vacuum medium. Let a small geometric ﬁgure of a ﬁxed proper volume V0 move uniformly with
constant subrelativistic velocity v along the x-direction. The volume V0 we imagine as always immersed in a
ﬂuid that is isotropic, homogeneous and at rest, except such that its density ρ(x) increases in the x-direction
but is uniform in the y- and z-directions. Hence, as this small ﬁxed volume V0 moves in the x-direction, the
mass enclosed in its volume, V0ρ(x), increases. In an inertial frame at rest with respect to the geometric
ﬁgure the mass of the volume, V0ρ(x), is seen to grow. Concomitantly it is realized that the volume V0 is
sweeping through the ﬂuid and that this V0ρ(x) mass grows because there is a net inﬂux of mass coming
into V0 in a direction opposite to the direction of the velocity. In an analogous fashion, for the more complex
situation envisaged in this paper, simultaneously with the steady growth of the ZPF momentum contained
within the volume of the object discussed above, the object is sweeping through the ZPF of the I∗ inertial
observer and for him there is a net inﬂux of momentum density coming from the background into the object
and in a direction opposite to that of the velocity of the object.

As it is the ZPF radiation background of I∗ in the act of being swept through by the object which we
are calculating now, we ﬁx our attention on a ﬁxed point of I∗, say the point of the observer at (c2/a, 0, 0)
of I∗, that momentarily coincides with the object at the object proper time τ = 0, and consider that point
as referred to the inertial frame Iτ that instantaneously will coincide with the object at a future generalized
object proper time τ > 0. Hence we compute the Iτ -frame Poynting vector, but evaluated at the (c2/a, 0, 0)
space point of the I∗ inertial frame, namely in Iτ at the Iτ space-time point:

This Poynting vector we shall denote by Nzp
∗ . Everything however is ultimately referred to the I∗ inertial
frame as that is the frame of the observer that looks at the object and whose ZPF background the moving
object is sweeping through. In order to accomplish this we ﬁrst compute

The integrals are now taken with respect to the I∗ ZPF background (using then the k-sphere of I∗ introduced

This is why we denote this Poynting vector as Nzp
∗ , with an asterisk subindex instead of a τ subindex, to
indicate that it refers to the ZPF of I∗. Observe that in the last equality of Eq. (22) the term proportional
to the x-projection of the ordinary ZPF Poynting vector of I∗ vanishes. The net amount of momentum of

which is the complement and clear counterpart of Eq. (B8) of Appendix B, i.e., the negative of the expression
for p∗ evaluated in Eq. (B9). Furthermore by means of Eq. (19) we will calculate the force f zp
∗ directly from
the expression for pzp
. These steps are presented in the next Section. Prior to that however we present a
∗
discussion of the conceptual origin of the momentum ﬂux expression of Eq. (24) complemented with a more
detailed derivation of the cross product of Eq. (23) that is performed in Appendix A.

V. MOMENTUM FLUX AND NEWTONIAN INERTIA

Any observer at rest in an inertial frame sees the ZPF isotropically distributed around himself. The
Poynting vector Nzp and the momentum density gzp = Nzp/c2 of such ZPF vanish for that observer. This
is of course the case for the observer at rest in I∗. Consider now another inertial observer located at a
geometric point that, with respect to I∗, moves uniformly with constant velocity, v = ˆxvx = ˆxβc. Imagine
the instant of time when the geometric point is passing and in the immediate neighborhood of the stationary
I∗ observer. Both observers necessarily see the ZPF symmetrically and isotropically distributed around
themselves in their own frames. However, the ZPF for each observer is not, because of the Doppler shifts,
isotropically distributed with respect to the other frame. In the terminology of Appendix C the I∗-observer
is located at the center of his own k-sphere, but the moving point is necessarily located oﬀ-center of the
I∗-observer’s k-sphere. Hence, for the I∗-observer the ZPF Poynting vector, Nzp
∗ , and the corresponding
momentum density, gzp
∗ , impinging on the moving point should appear to be non-vanishing. Furthermore,
because the motion of the geometric point is uniform, not hyperbolic, both the Nzp
∗ at the moving
geometric point appear to the I∗-observer to be time-independent constants of the motion.

∗ and gzp

Extend now the consideration above to all the points inside a small ǫ-neighborhood of the previous geo-
metric point that comove with constant velocity v = ˆxcβ. Let V0 be the proper volume of that neighborhood.
Because of length contraction such neighborhood has, in I∗, the volume V∗ = V0/γ. Clearly to the observer in
I∗ the neighborhood’s gzp
∗ do not appear as vanishing because of the uniform motion with constant
velocity, v = ˆxβc, inducing Doppler shifts of all the neighborhood’s points with respect to I∗. If the said
neighborhood exactly coincides with the location and geometry of a moving object of proper volume V0 and
rest mass m0 that has the neighborhood’s central geometric point at its center, then according to ordinary
mechanics, the object appears to the observer in I∗ as carrying a mechanical momentum p∗ = γm0v.

∗ and Nzp

We turn now to the object’s corresponding ZPF momentum. Because the object occupies its proper
volume V0 and coincides with the uniformly moving ǫ-neighborhood, it has for the observer at rest in I∗ an
amount of ZPF momentum, V∗g∗ = (V0/γ)g∗, as described above. We re-emphasize that when measured
and from the point of view of the inertial observer comoving with the object, both the object momentum
and the Poynting vector of the ZPF do exactly vanish, the last because in k-space the object is at the center
of that observer’s k-sphere (Appendix C). In the present case of a constant velocity and zero acceleration
for the object, as opposed to the general case we have been considering of accelerated hyperbolic motion,
the momenta p∗ and pzp
∗ above are both of course constants. Hence their time derivatives in Eq. (19) both
vanish. We return to our original hyperbolic motion problem.

Let us go back to the paragraph immediately preceding Eq. (22). We again compute Eqs. (23) and
(24) but perform (23) in more detail. From Appendix A, we can compute the Poynting vector of Eq. (A4)
that the radiation should have at the (c2/a, 0, 0) point of Iτ but referred to I∗ with the coordinates of Eq.

where Ezp and Bzp stand for Ezp
τ (0, τ ) respectively as in the case of Eq. (23) and where as
in Eqs. (22), (23) and (24) the integration is understood to proceed over the k-sphere of I∗. The object
now is not in uniform but instead in accelerated motion. If suddenly at proper time τ the motion were to
switch from hyperbolic back to uniform because the accelerating action disappeared, we would just need to
replace in Eq. (25) the constant rapidity s at that instant for aτ , and βτ in Eq. (1) would then become
tanh(s/c). (But then Nzp would cease to be, for all times onward, a function of τ and force expressions as
Eq. (28) below would vanish.) Observe that we make explicit the τ dependence of this as well as of the

13

subsequent quantities below. Nzp
∗ (τ ) represents energy ﬂux, i.e., energy per unit area and per unit time
in the x-direction. It also implies a parallel, x-directed momentum density, i.e., ﬁeld momentum per unit
volume incoming towards the object position, (c2/a, 0, 0) of S, at object proper time τ and as estimated
from the viewpoint of I∗. Explicitly such momentum density is

tiﬁes the fraction of absorption or scattering at each frequency. Let V0 be the proper volume of the object,
namely the volume that the object has in the reference frame Iτ where it is instantaneously at rest at proper
time τ . From the viewpoint of I∗, however, such volume is then V∗ = V0/γτ because of Lorentz contraction.
The amount of momentum due to the radiation inside the volume of the object according to I∗, i.e., the
radiation momentum in the volume of the object viewed at the laboratory is

which is again Eq. (24).

At proper time τ = 0, the (c2/a, 0, 0) point of the laboratory inertial system I∗ instantaneously coincides
and comoves with the object point of the Rindler frame S in which the object is ﬁxed. The observer located
at x∗ = c2/a, y∗ = 0, z∗ = 0 instantaneously, at t∗ = 0, coincides and comoves with the object but because
the latter is accelerated with constant acceleration a, the object according to I∗ should receive a time rate
of change of incoming ZPF momentum of the form:

We postulate that such rate of change may be identiﬁed with a force from the ZPF on the object.
Such interpretation, intuitively at least, looks extremely natural. In this respect Rindler [12] in introducing
Newton’s second law makes the following important epistemological point: “This is only ‘half’ a law; for it
is a mere deﬁnition of force,” and this is precisely the sense in which we introduce it here as a deﬁnition of
the force of reaction by the ZPF. If the object has a proper volume V0, the force exerted on the object by
the radiation from the ZPF as seen in I∗ at t∗ = 0 is then

is an invariant scalar with the dimension of mass. The expression for mi diﬀers considerably from the
corresponding one in [7] because here, on purpose, no interaction features were included in the analysis.
Such ZPF-particle interactions will be taken up in future work. Observe that in Eq. (30) we have neglected
a factor of 4/3. Such factor must be neglected because a fully covariant analysis (Appendix D) will show
that it disappears. The corresponding form of mi as written (and without the 4/3 factor) is then susceptible
of a very natural interpretation: Inertial mass of an object is that fraction of the energy of the ZPF radiation
enclosed within the object that interacts with it (parametrized by the η(ω) factor in the integrand). Further
discussion of this point we leave for the Appendices B and D. Clearly if the acceleration suddenly ceases at
proper time τ , Eqs. (28) and (29) identically vanish signaling the fact that acceleration is the reason that
the vacuum produces the opposition that we identify with the force of reaction known as inertia. From the
proper time instant τ when the acceleration a is turned oﬀ, the object continues in uniform motion. The
object proceeds onwards with the rapidity s it acquired up to that point, namely aτ . Thus βτ in Eq. (1)

14

(27).

(28)

(29)

(30)

and all quantities from Eqs. (25) to (27) become constants, as the rapidity s ceases to depend on the proper
time τ . Because of the Lorentz invariance of the ZPF energy density spectrum [16], the object is left at rest
in the inertial frame Iτ and at the center of the k-sphere of the Iτ observer but oﬀ-center of the k-sphere of
the I∗ one (Appendix C). From the I∗ perspective the object appears to possess a momentum (which reﬂects
the ZPF momentum inside V0, a point that will become clear in Appendix B). Observe furthermore that in
Eq. (30) and previous equations some cut-oﬀ procedure is implicit in that η(ω) subsides at high frequencies.
(Otherwise we recall the cut-oﬀ referred to in Appendix A according to the prescription of [17].)

15

VI. RELATIVISTIC FORCE EXPRESSION

The coeﬃcient mi that we identify with the ZPF contribution to inertial mass, corresponds then just to
the ZPF-induced part of the rest mass of the object. In order to simplify the discussion that follows, however,
we will usually take this ZPF contribution as all of inertial mass. If the vacuum exerts an opposition force
on the accelerated object of magnitude −mia as in Eq. (29) and if Newton’s third law (Eq. (14)) holds, then
the accelerating agent must exert an active force f of amount f = mia to produce the acceleration. This is
Newton’s equation of motion. The radiative opposition made by the vacuum precisely coincides time-wise
with the onset of acceleration at every point throughout the interior of the accelerated object, continues
exactly so long as the acceleration persists and is in direct proportion to the amount of mass associated
with that small region. Herein lies the intuitive power of the approach. The only other alternative is the
traditional one of Newton that assumes such inertial opposition comes from the object itself “because it
has a fundamental property called mass.” This however leaves the origin of inertia unexplained. Inertia we
argue is a phenomenon created by the vacuum as in Eq. (30). It is important to add that our analysis yields
not just the nonrelativistic Newtonian case but it also embodies a fully relativistic description within special
relativity [12] at least for the case of longitudinal forces, i.e., forces parallel to the direction of motion (See
however Sec. VII).

From the deﬁnition of the momentum pzp

∗ in Eq. (27), from Eqs. (28), (29), and the force equation (14)

it immediately follows that the momentum of the object is

in exact agreement with the momentum expression for a moving object in special relativity [12]. The
expression for the space vector component of the four-force [12] is then

p∗ = miγτ ~βτ c,

F∗ = γτ

dp∗
dt∗

=

dp∗
dτ

,

and as the force is pure in the sense of Rindler [12], the correct form for the four-force immediately follows
(recalling (12) for the space part):

in the ordinary way anticipated above. Consistency with Special Relativity is established. (For a detailed

VII. GENERAL MOTION

Our analysis so far has been restricted to the case of simple hyperbolic motion, i.e., rectilinear motion
with uniformly constant proper acceleration a that remains the same throughout the trajectory of the object.
Here we give reasons suggesting an extension of the argument to the case of general motion, i.e., a motion
along a nonrestricted trajectory where the proper acceleration, henceforth denoted as a(τ ), does not remain
constant, neither in magnitude nor in direction, but on the contrary changes from one instant to the next of
object instantaneous proper time and becomes thereby a function of τ . We observe that in our derivation of
Eq. (33) the subrelativistic result f = mia depended only on the instantaneous value of the acceleration a,
i.e., on the hyperbolic moving object instantaneous proper acceleration, and not in any way whatsoever on
the history of the object motion.

For the case of general motion mentioned above, let us consider a second identical object also performing
hyperbolic motion but with a trajectory that has exactly the same constant proper acceleration, a0, as the
general motion object at one instant of the ﬁrst’s proper time τ = τ0. We thus write a(τ0) = a0. But for
the second object, i.e., that undergoing hyperbolic motion, we have shown that Eq. (33) holds and hence
that the accelerating agent must be applying a force mia0 = mia(τ0). Moreover, as argued above, this
expression displays complete independence from the past history of the object’s motion, i.e., expression (33)
and related previous expressions are memoryless. It is then quite reasonable to assume that as the force
(in the frame that instantaneously comoves with the object performing hyperbolic motion) is such that it
is exactly proportional to the acceleration and the result is indeed independent of the previous history of
the object motion, the same result should hold for the identical object in the case of general motion. This
means that for the case of general motion it should instantaneously hold that

f (τ ) = mia(τ ).

(34)

The instantaneous proper force is equal to mi times the instantaneous proper acceleration and both are
collinear vectors in the same direction as was the special case of the hyperbolically moving object. What
will be required for the conﬁrmation of this argument however are detailed calculations of several concrete
examples of nonhyperbolic but accelerated motion; e.g., the case of ordinary circular motion with constant
angular velocity that yields a centripetal acceleration a(τ ) of constant magnitude.

VIII. OUTLOOK AND CLOSING REMARKS

The dynamical approach of [7] required mathematical steps and approximations that led to a certain
complexity of presentation. The new development here is simpler in that it does not deal with the dynamics,
but exclusively with the form of the ZPF in relation to an accelerated object. The ﬁnal result is derived using
standard relativistic ﬁeld transformations and does not involve approximations. A fully covariant analysis is
presented in Appendix D.

The viewpoint of SED has been taken and matter has been assumed to be exclusively made of electro-
magnetically interacting particles or entities. Neutrons (presumed to consist of three charged quarks plus
several neutral gluons) are polarizable electromagnetically-interacting particles displaying at least several
experimentally known multipole moments. Neutrons are thus in principle treatable by our model whereas
neutrinos are presumably strictly neutral and not polarizable. It is however not clear if neutrinos do actually
have a rest mass and consequently display subrelativistic behavior or if instead they have no rest mass and
consequently are strictly relativistic. In either case neutrinos lie beyond the scope of our present considera-
tions as they do not interact electromagnetically. An explanation for the inertia of non-electromagnetically
interacting particles and ﬁelds, such as neutrinos, may follow similar lines in a more sophisticated develop-
ment. If as proposed in this paper (and in [7]) inertia appears because of the opposition of the vacuum (the
electromagnetic ZPF in the case of SED) to the motion through it of accelerated particles that interact with
its ﬁelds (Ezp and Bzp ﬁelds in the case of the ZPF of SED), one can naturally conjecture that the same
happens, in a more general way with the zero-point ﬂuctuations of other ﬁelds (like those of the weak and of
the strong interactions) that oppose the accelerated motion through them of accelerated entities capable of
interacting with them. The general idea is that rather than postulating an ad hoc mass-giving ﬁeld on top
of all the other ﬁelds, to examine instead if inertia can be explained by means of the already well-established
(vacuum) ﬁelds, as e.g. the approach of Vigier [1].

There is one further conjecture that the present work suggests. The four-momentum that the accelerat-
ing agent transmits to the object during the acceleration process should go directly to the surrounding vac-
uum ﬁeld [14]. The question is then whether the corresponding transferred linear momentum and associated
translational kinetic energy should be radiated away to inﬁnity in the ordinary manner of electromagnetic
radiation ﬁelds or if instead they stay around in the immediate vicinity of the object in the usual way of
bound ﬁelds [15]. The arguments of Sections III to VII point rather in the direction of this latter (second)
possibility. We conjecture that no radiated four-momentum (to inﬁnity) is produced. Presumably then only
bound or velocity ﬁelds, in the manner of spatially rapidly decaying evanescent ﬁelds outside the accelerating
object, are to be expected. As the moving object, made of electromagnetically interacting matter, enters
a given space region, the electromagnetic modes structure in that region is modiﬁed accordingly. But then
the ZPF is thereby also changed in that region. For this to be possible it may also help to realize that
at the extremely high frequencies involved [7] a strong nonlinear coupling between matter and ZPF exists.
Non-linearities in ﬁeld equations at very high energies are a commonplace theoretical possibility [18], e.g., in
our case of the simple electromagnetic ﬁeld, a generalized form of the equations of classical electrodynamics
may turn out to display non-linearities at very high energies. Ordinary Maxwell-Lorentz type equations
would just then represent the linear version of more general nonlinear equations applicable at all frequencies.

The above view may suggest that molecules, atoms and even simple electromagnetically interacting
particles, create around themselves and in their immediate vicinity some bound and nondissipative solitonic-
like waves that accompany those particles wherever they go. This speculative view is not new. Proponents of
source theories have for a long time [19] taken for granted evanescent ﬁelds that surround material particles.
These “source-ﬁelds” are presumably able to theoretically substitute for the action of the more mundane
electromagnetic vacuum of QED in derivations of “vacuum” eﬀects like the Casimir force, the Van der Waals
forces, etc. [19,20].

Last but not least we comment on where the concept presented here ﬁts within the context of ordinary
theory and in particular of standard classical theory. By looking at what we assumed in the course of this
development we can easily see what the concept presented here does aﬀect and also what it does not. We

18

very explicitly used the ordinary notion of what force is. So we cannot claim any direct explanation of that
concept, not even a clariﬁcation of what force means. With respect to this classical force concept what we
believe we have done is the following. Newton’s third law requires that the motive force deﬁned in the second
law be counterbalanced by a reaction force. This has traditionally been satisﬁed implicitly by assuming the
existence of inertia of matter. We propose to have found an explicit origin for this reaction force, viz. the
acceleration-dependent scattering of ZPF radiation that the accelerated object is forced to move into. Our
analysis presupposed electrodynamics and special relativity and other aspects of ordinary classical theory:
Electrodynamics and some aspects of special relativity have been used in our developments since we used
SED (that besides Maxwell’s equations also presupposes the Lorentz force). As far as radiation reaction
is concerned we merely suspect that it is somewhat connected with the developments here (and possibly
also those in [7] and/or [10]) but so far this is only a suspicion. As to what we perceive as the core result
of this work, we claim that our development represents a ﬁrst step in the direction of clarifying the origin
of what constitutes the essence of inertial mass. But it surely falls short in explicating all aspects of the
origin of inertia. Indeed the analysis deliberately excluded any local consideration of details on particle-
radiation interactions and only the electromagnetic aspect of the physical vacuum was involved. Only when
our approach here can be implemented by more detailed models and when it can be extended to other
components of the vacuum (other vacuum ﬁelds, e.g., weak, strong interactions) will inertial mass be able
to be made assimilable to a property material objects of all sorts have because material objects aﬀect the
structure of the underlying modes of the vacuum ﬁelds in which they are permanently immersed.

Finally we make two disclaimers. First, our development was exclusively made within the context of
classical theory (SED), so it is too early to say much about connections with quantum theory [21]. There
for example remains the more technical question of how the SED renormalization procedure proposed herein
(Appendix C) matches with its QED counterpart as both lead to essentially the same result. Second, we are
not prepared to face the issue of how and in what sense our development might possibly aﬀect or relate to
general relativity (beyond what was brieﬂy mentioned in Section I concerning Sakharov’s hypothesis).

APPENDIX A:
ZPF-AVERAGED PRODUCTS FOR THE ZPF POYNTING VECTOR

Here we proceed with the explicit evaluation of the averaged products of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld
components < EiBj >; i, j = x, y, z, that enter in the expression for the ZPF Poynting vector corresponding
to the radiation being swept through by the accelerated object as calculated from the viewpoint of the ob-
server at rest at (c2/a, 0, 0) of I∗. The resulting averaged products are part of the more extensive presentation
of the approach implemented in Section V. (Note that for simplicity we generally drop the ZP-superscript
notation for E and B.)

We will see that the diagonal ones < EiBi >; i = x, y, z, all vanish necessarily leading to the consequence

as was to be expected. Of the remaining < EiBj > averaged products we shall show that those products
involving one component in the direction of the acceleration a, i.e., one x-component of a ﬁeld, Ex or Bx,
vanish irrespectively of the other component:

< E · B >= 0

< ExBj >= 0; j = x, y, z

< EiBx >= 0; i = x, y, z.

The only products that are spared are < EyBz > and < EzBy >. They, moreover, will turn out to be the

Notice that this equation is not properly normalized. A normalization factor (2π)3/V , where V is the so
called electromagnetic cavity volume, has been omitted for brevity on the right hand side. A corresponding
compensating normalization factor (V /(2π)3)1/2 has also been omitted from the expressions for the ﬁelds,
starting from Eqs. (3) and (4) above. These normalization factors, standard in physical optics, have been
introduced also to SED [13], but as they mutually cancel after phase averaging we do not make them explicit
in this paper.

After using Eqs. (10) and (11) and phase averaging with (A5), we ﬁnd the ﬁrst component for the case

represents a frequency beyond which no material subparticle however small is going to be able to react to

APPENDIX B:
THE ZPF MOMENTUM CONTENT OF AN ACCELERATED OBJECT

The development of this ZPF momentum content approach serves to complement the ZPF momentum
ﬂux approach of Sections IV and V but is totally independent from it. Newton’s third law as expressed in
Eq. (19) implies that f zp
is the opposite of f∗. In Section V we calculate f zp
∗ . Here instead we calculate
∗
f∗. To calculate f∗ we use the fact, also given in Eq. (19), that f∗ is just the time derivative of p∗. This
p∗ is not the ZPF momentum ﬂowing through the object that we identiﬁed with pzp
∗ above, but rather the
momentum contained within the body that should be due to the ZPF, as will become clear as the argument
progresses. This means that we need to reach an expression for p∗, the object momentum, in terms of the
ZPF and the particle electromagnetic coupling parameters.

First we develop a connection between p∗ and pzp
∗ before deﬁning p∗ more precisely, so we examine the
∆pzp
∗ = −∆p∗ condition of Eq. (16) referring everything, including the ZPF background, to the I∗ inertial
frame. We need to estimate the net ZPF momentum, ∆pzp
∗ , and momentum density that entered into the
object in a time interval ∆t∗ because of the object’s sweeping accelerated motion through the electromagnetic
background (Secs. IV and V). As we take the integrated impulses pzp
∗ and p∗ both to be zero at time t∗ = 0
and they start to change at the same time, owing to Eq. (19) we should end up with

where we have integrated f zp
referred to the laboratory inertial frame I∗, then, pzp

∗ and f∗ over the I∗-frame time t∗. Moreover, because both pzp

∗ and p∗ are

∗ = V∗gzp

∗ and p∗ = V∗g∗ that with Eq. (B1) lead to

pzp

∗ = −p∗

gzp

∗ = −g∗.

(B1)

(B2)

We have calculated pzp
in Secs. IV and V. After confronting it with the result for p∗ (which we calculate
∗
below), we shall verify Eq. (B1), as is necessary for a self-consistent interpretation of momentum. Therefore,
as it will be explicitly conﬁrmed below, the previous result for gzp
∗ will be the negative of the expression (B7)
for g∗ below, that is calculated here in a direct and independent way. Eq. (B2) also makes sense intuitively
with the aid of the ﬂuid analogy of Sec. IV. In the short time interval ∆t∗ the momentum density inside
the object increases in an amount ∆g∗. The corresponding change of gzp
∗ in the same time interval is ∆gzp
∗ .
Hence if ∆g∗ is the internal change in momentum per unit volume of the ZPF in the interior of the object
and referred to I∗, then −∆gzp
∗ is the corresponding net amount of momentum per unit volume that in the
same time interval ∆t∗ is swept inside the object volume due to the hyperbolic motion of the object through
the ZPF of I∗. We now calculate the momentum density g∗ in a direct manner.

If the central idea that the ZPF is the entity responsible for a contribution to the inertia reaction force
is valid, then, from the point of view of the I∗ frame, it follows that when the accelerating agent applies
the external force f∗ and accelerates the object, necessarily the accelerating agent is doing work against the
vacuum ﬁelds and hence the energy provided by the accelerating agent is going to be stored somewhere in
that vacuum. We envision a dichotomous situation, i.e., two possible alternative ways in which the vacuum
may store this energy and its corresponding momentum provided by the accelerating agent . One way is that
the energy is “radiated away”, i.e., the vacuum traveling modes radiate it out far away from the accelerated
body. The other is that such energy and momentum are not indeed radiated out, but on the contrary stay
bound in the manner of velocity ﬁelds [15] in and around the body presumably in association to the ZPF
electromagnetic bound modes created by microscopic charge and current structures within the body. We
propose that the ﬁrst hypothesis, i.e., that the four-momentum is radiated away to inﬁnity is less natural
than the second, i.e., than the one that states that the four-momentum remains bound to the body: If a
billiard ball is hit by the billiard club (its accelerating agent) receiving this way energy and momentum,
i.e., four-momentum, and if this four-momentum were to escape to inﬁnity, there would not be a readily
natural way to explain how the ball in its turn subsequently transmitted all of its acquired four-momentum
at the instant of a subsequent collision with another identical billiard ball that was standing still on the
billiard table. The original ball’s four-momentum had been radiated away to inﬁnity! Explanations can
probably be concocted but not one that is in an obvious way natural. We assume then only the second

24

hypothesis in this dichotomy which assumes that the acquired four-momentum is not stored far away from
the accelerated object but, on the contrary, that it is stored within and in the body’s immediate vicinity.
Imagine an idealized body made of a simple electromagnetic cavity. The modes of the cavity contain ZPF
energy and if the cavity moves they can transport electromagnetic momentum.

We therefore, in spite of its still very preliminary nature, have to follow this second hypothesis, namely
that when a massive body moves with respect to some inertial frame the moving body drags with itself as
velocity ﬁelds within its ZPF-bound electromagnetic modes the corresponding translational kinetic energy
and momentum the body has with respect to that frame. Hence we assume that the momentum p∗ of the
moving object referred to the inertial frame I∗ is due to the ZPF that interpenetrates the object. In order to
ﬁnd p∗ we ﬁrst calculate the ZPF momentum density g∗ associated with the exact position of our accelerated
object attached to the frame S, at the point (c2/a, 0, 0) of that frame. As the motion is hyperbolic and in
the x-direction we only need to calculate

However, as we are calculating the ZPF momentum associated with the object and the object is instan-
taneously at rest in the Iτ frame, the calculation should be done with this in mind. This means (Appendix
C) that the integrals should be performed over the k-sphere of the Iτ frame. Additional support for this
view comes from the clear interpretation it yields. In order to evaluate Eq. (B3) we need then to compute
the relevant averaged cross-product of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in I∗ but evaluated at the object
space-time point of Eq. (B4):

proportional to the proper ZPF energy contained in the volume of the object, it is a simple matter to realize
that Eq. (B8) does indeed have the form of a relativistic momentum (p = γm0v with m0 the rest mass).

τ + B2

Having established that Eq. (B8) correctly represents the total ZPF momentum instantaneously con-
tained in the proper volume V0 of the object in question we next reintroduce a coupling parameter, η, which
is now a function of frequency, η(ω), and which will parametrize the amount of interaction (absorption or
scattering) at every frequency ω between the object and the radiative momentum ﬂux associated with it.
This will provide us the eﬀective physical momentum of the object. With this in mind we write:

Recognizing that this is the momentum of the body and that the accelerating force f∗ applied by the external

we then obtain the expression for the force f zp

As already mentioned above, the 4/3 factor becomes unity when a fully covariant evaluation is performed
(Appendix D). Observe that Eq. (B10) exactly reproduces the result for the inertia reaction force of Eq.
(29) and its associated inertial mass of Eq. (30). Observe furthermore that mi, when the 4/3 factor is
obliterated (Appendix D), has a clear interpretation, namely it is exactly the amount of energy of the ZPF
that lies inside the object’s proper volume V0 and that does actually interact with it (as depicted by the
frequency-dependent coupling eﬃciency function η(ω) divided by c2 to give it in units of mass). According
to the view presented here it is the parameter V0 and the spectral function η(ω) that determine the inertial
mass of the object. The expression for mi would precisely ﬁt the energy of the ZPF (divided by c2) that
couples to the object and that lies within its volume as properly assumed in the approach of this Appendix.
This interpretation is not so clearly found for the physical assumptions of the approach of Sections IV and
V and Appendix A, but still in that approach the same mi was found as required. Interestingly enough this
4/3 factor is the same factor found in the electrodynamics of classical charged particles [12, 15]. We found
here further motivation for pursuing the fully covariant analysis of Appendix D.

APPENDIX C: DISCUSSION ON THE EVALUATION
OF THE TIME RATE OF CHANGE OF ZPF MOMENTUM

This article has simplicity as one of its objectives. Insights however, are gained if we pay the price of
going through a few intricacies. In our analysis there appears a momentum density from the ZPF radiation
in accelerated frames that is dependent on the proper time of the accelerated object. Such proper time may
be removed by means of an artiﬁce. We believe that doing so would be physically incorrect and propose that
such time dependence actually has an important physical meaning. This entails the adoption of a convention
for the evaluation of otherwise indeﬁnite integrals. Removal of the proper time would imply a completely
diﬀerent situation than the one we are dealing with here. The momentum density mentioned above depends
on the object proper time.

A. Improper integrals and “time removal” technique

First of all we notice that the implicitly unbounded k and ω integrations of Sections IV, V and Ap-
pendices A and B when there is no η(ω) (i.e. set η(ω) ≡ 1) and the limits for k or ω are indeed 0 and
∞, constitute what are customarily called improper integrals. Improper integrals require some deﬁnition as
they do not yield a unique well-deﬁned value. In Sections IV and V and Appendices A and B we implicitly
adopted a deﬁnition. As the inertia resistance force expression of Eq. (29) resulted from integrating over
the ω or k of I∗ in an explicit manner and as that result was physically sound, as follows from the clear de-
lineation of Section III, we adopted the way of integrating implicit in that procedure as the actual deﬁnition
of the improper integral. That this result is not necessarily unique is however seen from what follows. By
performing a change of variable of integration, from that of I∗=Iτ (τ = 0) to that of Iτ (τ > 0), it can be
shown that a diﬀerent result is obtained. Moreover the procedure removes the proper time or τ -dependance
of the expressions. Thus it is sometimes referred to as a “time removal procedure” [22].

The procedure leads to a seemingly paradoxical situation as the integration apparently yields two dif-
ferent values. The paradox is easily resolved. Its solution yields insight into the origin of dpzp
∗ /dt∗, the time
rate of change of the radiation momentum in Eq. (28), and on its proposed connection to Newtonian inertia.

For the particular SED form of the “time removal” procedure [23,24], we start from the expression

This is not so surprising if we propose the view that what we have done by means of the transformation from
(k, k) to (k′, k′), i.e., from the variables of I∗ to the variables of Iτ , is to reevaluate the averaged Poynting
vector incident on the moving object not now as the observer at rest in I∗ estimates it, in which case such
N does not vanish, but as viewed from the space point (c2/a, 0, 0) of the inertial frame Iτ where the object
is found at rest at proper time τ and from where the ZPF of Iτ is necessarily seen as homogeneously and
isotropically distributed.

Next we show how the formalism of Eq. (C4), that involves a transformation of the four-wavevector
(k, k) from I∗ to Iτ and its corresponding inverse transformation that transforms from the (k′, k′) four-
wavevector of Iτ back into that of I∗, take us, at least formally, from the Poynting vector N impinging on
the object as estimated in I∗ to the same N but as estimated in Iτ , and the second transformation back
from the N impinging on the object as viewed in Iτ to the same but as viewed in I∗.

From Eq. (A4) the incident N on the object, as viewed in I∗, is (c/2π) times the expression < EyBz >
of Eqs. (A30) and (C3). Hence because of Eqs. (C7) and (A4) the (k, k) → (k′, k′) transformation of (C4)
takes us from the N of Eq. (25) to

N =

that as shown below is the N at proper time τ impinging on the object according to an inertial observer
instantaneously coinciding and comoving with the object, hence at rest in Iτ . Eq. (C13) of course vanishes
(after the angle integration Eq. (C8)) as it should because the ZPF in every inertial frame is homogeneous and
isotropic. Recall that our ultimate proper time of evaluation is indeed τ = 0 when Iτ becomes I∗=Iτ (τ = 0).
The corresponding N(τ ) at proper time τ exactly equal to zero, N(τ = 0), also vanishes as follows from Eq.
(B6).

Next we perform the inverse four-wavevector transformation (k′, k′) → (k, k) from the four-wavevector
of Iτ to that of I∗ on the expression that corresponds to the N of Eq. (C13), that is the N viewed in Iτ .
Nevertheless, we ﬁrst derive the explicit form of the N of Iτ and show that it indeed corresponds to Eq.
(C13) and only then, at a second stage, perform the aforementioned transformation.

Consider the ZPF E′ and B′ ﬁelds of Iτ at time tτ of Iτ and for concreteness at the point xτ = c2/a, yτ =
0, zτ = 0, that is the point of Iτ that at object proper time τ coincides and comoves with the object. Take

that is the Poynting vector impinging on the object point in S according to the observer at I∗. So we recover
the Poynting vector derived in (25).

Of course both the N of Eq. (C19) and the N of Eq. (C21) vanish at object proper time τ = 0: that
of Eq. (C19) because of symmetry after the angle integrations and that of Eq. (C21) since in that case the
evaluation is made for vanishing proper time. In Eq. (C21) we have recovered the proper time dependence.
This shows how the (k, k) four-vector transformation takes us from the N of the object point in S as viewed
in I∗ that we derived in Eq. (25) to the corresponding N but as viewed in Iτ that was derived in Eq. (C19).

The inverse transformation takes us back in exactly the opposite way from the N as viewed in Iτ to the
corresponding N as viewed in I∗.

This last example illustrates how and in what sense one can formally at least remove and place back

the time variable into the expressions. A more fundamental explanation follows.

B. Spheres of integration in k-space: k-spheres

Expression (26) for the momentum density g(τ ) was obtained with an integration carried out over the
k-space of the laboratory system I∗. The momentum density referred however to the estimate that an
observer, at rest at (c2/a, 0, 0) of I∗, can make concerning the momentum density the observer views should
be incident on the accelerated object. At proper time τ the object is instantaneously at rest at the point
(c2/a, 0, 0) of the inertial frame Iτ that moves with respect to I∗ with the velocity βτ cˆx given in Eq. (1).

From Eqs. (1), (2) and (C20), the last written as

one can express Eq. (26) in terms of wavevectors only

where the primed wavevector refers to that of Iτ and again the unprimed one is that of I∗. If subsequently
the integration is carried over k, the wavevector of I∗, the result is again Eq. (26). However if we transform
from the wavevector integration of I∗ to that of Iτ by means of Eq. (C5), we obtain an integral exclusively
over k of the form

that when simply integrated of course vanishes because of symmetry. This is another way of viewing the
same seemingly paradoxical situation of Eq. (A4) versus Eq. (C12). The inconsistency originates in the
improper integral. When the integral is modiﬁed by a cut-oﬀ factor a more clear picture emerges. If we
multiply the integrand in Eq. (C23), that is equivalent to that in Eq. (26) by the cut-oﬀ factor exp(−ω′/ωc)
and integrate over k it can readily be seen that the integral vanishes [25] . If after this we take the limit
ωc → ∞ the integral is left at zero value. However if instead we multiply by a cut-oﬀ factor of the form
exp(−ω/ωc) the result is

(26) but with the integration over ω3dω carried out

There are clearly two diﬀerent cases to consider. (i) For an observer at (c2/a, 0, 0) of I∗, at object
proper time τ and corresponding I∗ time t∗, the object appears to be moving with velocity ˆxβτ c and with
mechanical momentum mγτ βτ cˆx (where m is the rest mass) and the ZPF looks spherically symmetric with

31

(C22)

(C23)

(C24)

(C25)

respect to the k = 0 point, i.e., the origin of the k-space corresponding to I∗. (ii) For an observer that at the
same object proper time τ is instead located at the point (c2/a, 0, 0) of Iτ and thus instantaneously coincides
and comoves with the object, the object is of course at rest with no momentum and no velocity and the ZPF
looks spherically symmetric around the origin of the corresponding k′-space that is the k-space of Iτ .

So, for the I∗ observer the ZPF cannot be spherically symmetrically distributed around the object.
However, for the Iτ observer at object proper time τ the ZPF does appear to be spherically symmetrically
distributed around the object. We emphasize that these two assertions, that of I∗ and that of Iτ , refer to
the object at the same proper time instant τ .

From the above discussion we extract the concept of the ZPF k-sphere of an inertial observer which is the
sphere in k-space up to the cut-oﬀ radius kc = ωc/c around the origin at k = 0 of the k-space corresponding
to the observer’s rest inertial frame. Inertial observers automatically have a unique k-sphere which is the one
corresponding to the inertial frame with respect to which they are at rest. The ZPF radiation for an inertial
observer is the ZPF radiation contained in the inertial observer’s k-sphere where ωc is the cut-oﬀ associated
with the ZPF spectral distribution. If no cut-oﬀ is considered for the ZPF then the sphere has inﬁnite radius
as we let the radius of the sphere in the corresponding k-space go to inﬁnity, namely, kc = ωc/c → ∞.

We illustrate the concept of the ZPF k-sphere for the case of the analysis performed in Section V, in
particular for Eq. (34) and related equations. At proper time τ = 0 and corresponding I∗ time t∗ = 0,
when the object instantaneously coincides with the observer stationed in I∗ at the point (c2/a, 0, 0), this
observer claims that the ZPF k-sphere is symmetrically distributed around the object. Therefore, when the
momentum density is calculated under this condition in general it should vanish as also follows from Eq.
(26) or Eq. (C21) when τ = 0. In the same way the object momentum is viewed to be zero. This is however
not the case after a lapse of proper time ∆τ when the acceleration of the hyperbolic motion has taken the
object to be moving with velocity β∆τ cˆx with respect to such an observer stationed in I∗. For the observer
in I∗ still of course the ZPF distribution remains the same, i.e., spherically symmetric around himself and
with a cut-oﬀ at ω = ωc. But as the object is moving with respect to this observer, at rest at the point
(c2/a, 0, 0) of I∗, he would claim that the object is not located at the center of his k-sphere. So the observer
at the point (c2/a, 0, 0) of I∗ at proper time ∆τ > 0, should see two things: (i) the object moving with
momentum miγ∆τ β∆τ cˆx and (ii) a net non-zero momentum density of ZPF radiation g(∆τ ) given by Eq.
(26), with τ replaced by ∆τ , that is impinging on the object as argued in Sections III, IV amd V, and in
Appendix A.

In summary, every inertial observer has an associated k−sphere, and he is at the central point of that
sphere. Hence the ZPF of his inertial frame is isotropically and homogeneously distributed around him.
And this is true for all inertial observers. An entirely diﬀerent question is how an inertial observer with his
associated k−sphere assesses the situation for a moving point from the perspective of his inertial frame. The
observer’s ZPF is in general neither homogeneously nor isotropically distributed around the moving point
because the moving point is located oﬀ-center in the observer’s k−sphere.

32

APPENDIX D: COVARIANT APPROACH

The analysis of Sections IV and V and of Appendix B considered only the momentum density g (or
equivalently the Poynting vector N = c2g) contribution to the electromagnetic momentum p. There is
however an additional contribution to the momentum that was neglected there. Here we calculate that
additional contribution. The price we pay is the need to invoke a more abstract, not so directly intuitive,
formalism. The advantage, besides theoretical generality, is, very importantly, a simpler expression and a
more direct interpretation for the inertial mass mi of Eq. (30) [26].

The standard expression for the four-momentum is

In mechanics, the space part is

where pN is the standard newtonian momentum

and m the rest mass. U corresponds to the kinetic energy

In the case of an electromagnetic ﬁeld of total energy U and momentum p, the four-momentum (D1) can be
expressed as an integral over the electromagnetic energy-momentum stress tensor [27]

Z
where dσν is a component of a planar three-dimensional space-like hypersurface element d3σ such that

and

with ην the normal unit vector to the hyperplane. This unit four-vector ην is then timelike, and in the
(− + ++) convention we have

and along the direction of the worldline trajectory of the object at the point event, so

and ~β = v/c is the vectorial velocity of the object in units of c. In our case the object is viewed from the
laboratory inertial frame I∗, and at proper time τ it is instantaneously at rest in the inertial frame Iτ . We
thus select ην as (γτ , γτ ~βτ ), with ~βτ c the object velocity as measured in I∗, to be the unit normal vector
to the hypersurface as viewed in I∗ and then dσν has both time and space components. In Iτ however, the
object velocity at proper time τ is zero by deﬁnition and so ην = (1, 0, 0, 0) and thus

Expression (D14b) gives us the clue of how to correct the noncovariant approaches of Sections IV andV
and of Appendix B and make them fully covariant. We can do this either to the momentum-ﬂux approach
of Section IV and V or to the momentum-content approach of Appendix B. The second case, namely the
momentum content approach of Appendix B is more in line with the particular interpretation that we would
like to emphasize for the inertial mass of Eq. (30). So we go to the momentum density g∗ and the momentum
p∗ of the electromagnetic radiation inside the volume of the object as viewed from I∗ represented in Eqs.
(B7) and (B8) of Appendix B. The momentum of Eq. (B8) was calculated noncovariantly and then directly
from the momentum density of (B7) as equal to the I∗ momentum density multiplied by the volume that
the object has in I∗, namely V∗, mimicking the purely newtonian case, as for the pN of Eq. (D2) and (D3)
above. In order to obtain the proper space part of the four-momentum (Eqs. (D1) and (D2) above) we need
to replace the momentum density expression g∗ by the corrected expression: g∗ + (T∗ · v)/c2.

When we integrate over the volume of the object in Eq. (D14b) we use the invariant element d3x′ of
Eq. (D11), i.e., the three-volume element of Iτ . As the object volume was assumed so small, the integrand

required. Here we can do the same. Eq. (D14b) yields then instead of Eq. (B6) the expression

The triangular brackets term in the second equality vanishes because it is propotional to the ZPF Poynting
vector of Iτ in the x-direction and the integrations, as clearly explained in Appendix B, should be carried over
the k-sphere of Iτ . It is furthermore straightforward to show that each one of the summands < Eyτ Bzτ >

that results after a mutual cancellation of two factors of the form γ2

Newtonian gravitation. However our inertia work reported here and in [7] as well as the equivalence
principle suggest to us that the ZPF approach to gravitation remains promising once a more detailed
relativistic particle model is implemented.

[14] As the space part of the force four-vector that corresponds to f + f zp = 0 uniquely vanishes in all frames,
the time part should also vanish which means that v · f + v · f zp = 0 in all frames (zero-component
Lemma). This together with Eq.
(14) necessarily means that the energy and momentum given by
the accelerating agent to the object is immediately passed by the object to the surrounding vacuum
ﬁeld. When the object is later decelerated by another external agent, the energy and momentum ﬂow
backward from the vacuum to the decelerating agent. The proof of this conjecture that the vacuum is
the reservoir of the four-momentum of all moving bodies requires however critical analysis beyond the
limited scope of the present work.

[25] If we insist on calculating the integral over the variables (k, k) of I∗ instead of (k′, k′), i.e., those of Iτ ,
as long as the cut-oﬀ is spherically symmetric around the k-space origin of Iτ the end result should also
be zero. This is more easily done by means of an exponential cut-oﬀ in a development due to Boyer
(D.C. Cole, 1993–1994 personal communication). Expression (C23) with such cut-oﬀ reads

Integration over the azimuth and over the frequency ω = ck yields an expression proportional again to
ω4
c and to an integral expression on the latitude angle. This last it can be shown identically vanishes.
So, even if the limit ωc → ∞ is taken at the end, the result is still zero.

[26] All four books in references [12] and [15] may be useful references here. The book of Rohrlich, in [12],
devotes considerable part of it to the mass problem for classical electrodynamics. We will need material
from Rohrlich p. 86 ﬀ and p. 129 ﬀ. In the book of Jackson, in [15], this material appears in pp. 236 ﬀ
and pp. 791 ﬀ. In Konopinski’s book [15], this material is scattered through several chapters. Rindler
gives only a concise exposition of the electromagetic energy tensor in Sec. 42 of his book [12].

[27] For P µ to be a four-vector the four-divergence of the electromagnetic energy momentum stress tensor
should vanish, ∂µΘµν = 0. As the only interaction considered in this work is the electromagnetic and as
explicitly we omit any other components of the vacuum besides the electromagnetic, there is no question
that the stress tensor Θµν is purely electromagnetic. In more complex models where there are other
interactions it would be the four-divergence of the sum of the electromagnetic and the other ﬁeld stress
tensor (Poincar´e stress) that should vanish, i.e., ∂µ(Θµν +Θµν
other) = 0. In such a case it becomes a matter
of choice if individually ∂µΘµν and ∂µΘµν
other each separately vanishes or not, and their divergences are
then just the opposites of each other. A nice discussion of this point is found in I. Campos and J. L.
Jim´enez, Phy. Rev. D 33, 607 (1986) (See also I. Campos and J. L. Jim´enez, Eur. J. Phys. 13, 177
(1992); T. H. Boyer, Phys. Rev. D 25, 3246 (1982); T. H. Boyer, Phys. Rev. D 25, 3251 (1982)). So
when there are other ﬁelds (interactions), the electromagnetic four-vector character of P µ is not that
compelling, but in the present purely electromagnetic case such four-vector character necessarily holds
since ∂µΘµν = 0. In the pure electromagnetic case that for simplicity of treatment we assume here, the
4/3 factor becomes unity. If, on the other hand, we were to assume other ﬁelds (e.g. those participating

39

in the η(ω) response of the particle) then the obliteration of the 4/3 factor becomes more a matter of
theoretical preference.

[28] The theory of the classical electron also presented a factor of 4/3 that could be “corrected” to unity
by assuming a point model for the electron with an electromagnetic energy-momentum stress tensor of
[27] and the articles there for some insights on the
vanishing divergence. See the discussion of Ref.
history of the 4/3 factor; also the book of Rohrlich [12], pp. 16–18 for a detailed scholarly account.

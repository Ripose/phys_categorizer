Polarization transfer in SIDIS

Abstract. Polarization transfer from the longitudinally polarized positron to the
ﬁnal-state quark is considered for the underlying QCD subprocesses giving rise to the
reaction e+

↑ + p → e+ + Λ↑ + X at the HERMES energy.

Measuring the longitudinal Λ polarization in the semi-inclusive deeply inelastic

scattering (SIDIS)

↑ + p → e+ + Λ↑ + X ,
e+

that is under study in the experiment HERMES at DESY, may give important
information for the determination of the twist-2 polarized fragmentation function
G1(z, µ). The latter can be found through the relation

DLL ∼ Fq(x) · ˆσ · ˆdLL · G1(z, µ) ,

where Fq(x) is the unpolarized parton (quark/gluon) distribution function in the
proton and the polarization transfer DLL is deﬁned as

DLL =

σ++ + σ−− − σ+− − σ−+
σ++ + σ−− + σ+− + σ−+

and it can be measured in the experiment. The hatted entities in (2) relate to the
underlying QCD subprocess. The subscripts in σ’s in (3) denote the positron and
Λ helicities.

The published HERMES measurement in the reaction (1) is DLL = 0.11 ± 0.17 ±

0.03 [1].

As is seen from (2), it is very instructive to study ˆdLL for the purpose of the data

handling and analysis. The parameter can also be expressed as ˆdLL = P z

pair production by γ∗G coupling. The spin transfer properties in the production
of heavy Q ¯Q quarks are discussed in ref. [2].

The purpose of this study is to look for kinematic regions where the polarization
transfer ˆdLL gets enhanced in the subprocesses of ﬁg. 1 and ﬁg. 2. Being translated
onto the hadronic level, these kinematic regions, if any, can serve as guidelines for
the experiment HERMES. The interval of DIS variables (Q2, y and other) was
chosen to be typical for HERMES.

The calculations are based on the following expression for the scattered quark

vector polarization

P z

out =

(1 + P in
(1 + P in

z ) (|M++|2 − |M−+|2) + (1 − P in
z ) (|M++|2 + |M−+|2) + (1 − P in

z ) (|M+−|2 − |M−−|2)
z ) (|M+−|2 + |M−−|2)

,

which can be derived from the ﬁnal-state spin-density matrix.

The properties of the elastic subprocess (4) are plotted in ﬁg. 3. Both the diﬀer-
ential cross section dσ and polarized diﬀerential cross section d∆σ decrease with
increasing Q2 so that the polarization transfer ˆdLL increases rapidly. It achieves the
value ∼0.8 at the extreme value of Q2 ∼ 4 GeV2. For modest momentum transfers,
say Q2 ∼ 2 GeV2, ˆdLL has the ’normal’ values of ∼ 0.2.

Fig. 4 represents the parameter ˆdLL calculated for the reaction (5) at four diﬀerent
values of the angle φ between two characteristic planes of the reaction – leptonic
plane and the plane formed by the virtual photon and the outgoing quark. As
is known, the polarization properties of the reactions 2 → 3 depend essentially, in
general, on the rotational angle φ. The distributions of ˆdLL in ﬁg. 4 are shown for

four rotations of the planes with an increment equal to 90o. The lowest values of
ˆdLL are obtained at φ = 180o when the normals to the said plains are anti-collinear.
The more sizeable values of ˆdLL appear when the normals make right angles (90o
or 270o) – up to ∼0.4. And the most favorite kinematic region is predicted for the
collinar normals (φ = 0) where the polarization transfer increases up to 0.6.

So coming down to the experiment (1), one can expect the sizeable longitudi-
nal component of the Λ polarization induced by the polarized positron under the
kinematic conﬁgurations in which the normals to the leptonic plane and the plane
(γ∗, Λ) are close to be collinear. The numeric estimates made at the HERMES
energy can certainly be aﬀected by the higher-order corrections.

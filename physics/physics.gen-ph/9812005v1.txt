Abstract

We propose a simple variational form of the wave function to describe the

ground state and vortex states of a system of weakly interacting Bose gas in

an anisotropic trap. The proposed wave function is valid for a wide range of

the particle numbers in the trap. It also works well in the case of attractive

interaction between the atoms. Further, it provides an easy and fast method

to calculate the physical quantities of interest. The results compare very well

with those obtained by purely numerical techniques. Using our wave function

we have been able to verify, for the ﬁrst time, the predicted behaviour of

aspect ratio.

I. INTRODUCTION

Observation of Bose-Einstein condensation in cooled and trapped dilute gases of alkali

atoms [1–3] and spin polarized atomic hydrogen [4] has generated a renewed theoretical

interest in understanding such systems. In a meanﬁeld approach, which is valid in the limit

ρa3 << 1, where ρ is density of atoms and a is the s-wave scattering length, ground state

and vortex states of these systems can be described by Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation [5].

Various numerical procedures [6–10] and approximate analytical methods [11–13] have been

used to solve the GP equation. Among these variational scheme proposed by Baym and

Pethick [11] to explain the experimental observations of Ref. [1] is particularly appealing.

In this approach the trial wave function was taken to be of the form of ground state of

the trap potential (modeled by an anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential). Thus the

wave function is represented by a three dimensional Gaussian with axial and transverse

frequencies as variational parameters. This form of wave function, however, is valid only

when the number of atoms in the trap is very small. As the number increases, the repulsive

interaction between the atoms tends to expand the condensate and ﬂatten the density proﬁle

in the central region of the trap where the density is maximum. Of these two eﬀects,

only expansion of the condensate can be described adequately by the Gaussian trial wave

function. On the other hand, the Thomas-Fermi approximation provides a wave function

which is valid when the number of atoms is very large [9,11]. However, there is no suitable

form of variational wave function in the intermediate region. It is also important to note

that the Thomas-Fermi wave function does not describe the surface region properly which

signiﬁcantly aﬀects some relevent physical observables e.g. the aspect ratio [9]. This then

makes it necessary to have a suitable form of wave function which is valid even when the

particle number is very large.

In this paper we propose a simple form of wave function for the ground state. The wave

function is valid for a very wide range of particle numbers. When the number is small it

tends to mimic a Gaussian, and in the opposite limit it resembles the Thomas-Fermi wave

2

function. However for large number of atoms the wave function diﬀers from the Thomas-

Fermi wave function in the surface region, a desirable feature as noted above. The trial wave

function has got an additional parameter comapared to the ones used in Ref. [11]. This

parameter takes care of the ﬂattening of the density in the central region of the condensate.

Thus, it provides a better lower bound for the ground state energy than the Gaussian

trial wave function. We also compare the results obtained by our trial wave function with

those obtained by other numerical procedures such as the minimization of energy functional

by steepest descent method [9] and the integration of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation

[8,10]. These comparisons show the form chosen by us to be highly accurate for obtaining

a host of physical qauantities of interest. In addition to providing acurate results for a very

wide range of the particle numbers, the method is also very fast from the comutational

point of view. Further, using this wave function, the physical observables can be expressed

analytically in terms of three variational parameters which are obtained by minimizing the

GP energy functional. Since we have a simple analytical form for the energy in terms of three

variational parameters the procedure of minimization is very simple. The novel achievement

of this method lies in verﬁcation of the predicted behaviour of the aspect ratio which is very

important quantity from the experimental point of view. It could not be ascertained before

because convergence of the aspect ratio to the highly repulsive limit is very slow [9]. Since

our method can handle even very large number of atoms in the trap without any diﬃculty

we could verify the behaviour of the aspect ratio.

Based on physical reasoning we generalise the variational form to descibe the vortex

states also. As is the case with the ground state, we ﬁnd good agreement with the existing

results, with considerably less computational eﬀort.

Condensation has also been observed in 7Li [2] where interatomic interaction is attracive

which is characterized by the negative s-wave scattering length. As the number of atoms in

the trap inceases the condensate shrinks and nonuniformity in the central region increases.

After a critical number of atoms in the trap, the condensate collapses. This situation is also

very well descibed by our trial wave function. The parameter which accounts for ﬂattening

3

of the density proﬁle in the case of repulsive interactions also takes care of the increase in

density gradient in an eﬀective way . The critical number of atoms for the case of 7Li is in

close agreement with that reported in Ref. [10].

The paper is organized as follows. Section II contains the description of the variational

scheme employed in the paper. It also contains the analytic expressions for the observables

of interest. Results obtained from the variational procedure and their comparison with the

existing ones are presented in Section III. Section IV contains summary and concluding

remarks.

II. VARIATIONAL METHOD

A. Ground state

Bose Einstien condensation in experiments with cooled and trapped atoms can be de-

scribed within the framework of the GP theory. Validity of such a description has been

analysed by Stenholm [14]. In a situation where the trap can be modeled by an anisotropic

harmonic oscillator potential and the interatomic ineractions can be replaced by an eﬀective

pseudo-potential involving s-wave scattering length, the ground state energy for condensed

bosons of mass m is given by the Gross-Pitaevskii functional [5]

It is not possible to ﬁnd exact analytic solution to Eq.(9). Consequently various numerical

techniques have been developed to study the ground state property of such systems within

the framework of the GP theory. These techniques involve either the direct numerical

minimization of Eq.(6) with the constraint of Eq.(8) [9] or numerical integration of Eq.(9)

or its time dependent version [6–8,10]. Another approach is to use the variational method

which has been extensively used in diﬀerent branches of physics. The main advantage of this

method is that with a suitable guess for the form of the wave function it is possible to save

a lot of computational eﬀort and time. In addition, it may also provide physical insights

which generally get obscured in the complicated computational procedures. The ﬁrst study

of this kind was done by Baym and Pethick [11] in light of the experimental observations in

87Rb [1]. They took the trial wave function for the ground state as

with eﬀective frequencies, ω⊥ and ωz, treated as variational parameters. However, the wave

function above brings out only the qualitative features of the condensate e.g. expansion

of the condensate in diﬀerent directions, shifts in the angular frequencies and the scaling

behaviour of energy with the number of atoms in the trap. Further, this form of the wave

function is valid only for small number of atoms in the trap (see Fig.3 below). We now

propose a variational form of the wave function and demonstrate its applicability and utility

in providing accurate description of the condensate for a wide range of the particle numbers.

(11)

where, λ, ω⊥ and p are the variational parameters which are obtained by minimizing the

energy E1 in Eq.(6) with respect to these parameters. It is easily veriﬁed that the wave

function satisﬁes the normalization condition of Eq.(8). This particular form of the trial

wavefunction is motivated by the following considerations.

6

1. The form of the wave function is known in the limiting cases. In a situation where the

nonlinear interation term in Eq.(9) can be neglected the wave function is a Guassian

as described by Eq.(10). Such a situation corresponds to a very small scattering

length or very small number of atoms in the trap. This form of wave function can

be obtained from our wave function in the limit p

1. In the opposite limit, where

→

the interaction term is so large that the kinetic energy term can be neglected, the

wave function is parabolic. This is known as the Thomas-Fermi approximation. The

situation corresponds to a large scattering length or large number of atoms in the trap.

This form of wave function is valid in the central region of the trap. It is easy to see

that our wave function also behaves as the Thomas-Fermi wave function in the central

region of the trap as p becomes signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from unity.

2. We can identify two major eﬀects of the interaction term. First, the condensate will

expand because of the repulsive interaction(a > 0). The expansion will be anisotropic

because of the anisotropy in the trapping potential. This eﬀect can be described by

a trial wave function of the form given by Eq.(10) as noted in Ref. [11]. Second,

the interaction strength depends on the density. Higher the density more will be the

repulsion. This results in the ﬂattening of the density proﬁle and thus departure from

a Gaussian proﬁle in the central region of the trap. Tail of the wave function, on the

other hand, hardly feels the eﬀect of interaction as the density is very low in that

region. Therefore, away from the centre of the trap, the wave function can be desribed

by the one in the noninteracting case. Both the Gaussian trial wave function and the

Thomas-Fermi wave function descibed in Ref. [11] fail to capture this eﬀect. We will

show in the following section that both these eﬀects are well described by our wave

function.

3. When the interatomic interaction is attractive i.e. a < 0 the condensate will contract.

Due to the density dependent interaction, the density proﬁle is much steeper in the

central region before the whole condensate collapses at a crital number of atoms in the

7

trap. This situation is also well descibed by the proposed trial wave function. In this

case p < 1.

To illustrate some of the points mentioned here we plot e−(x2)p

in Fig.1 for diﬀerent values

of p. The eﬀect of increasing (decreasing) p above (below) 1 on the function near x = 0

is evident. For p > 1, which describes the repulsive interaction, the density is ﬂattened

compared to the Gaussian wave function. For p < 1, which is the case for the attractive

interaction, the density becomes steeper.

For a particular value of N the parameters ω⊥, λ and p are obtained by minimizing the

and it takes a few seconds of the real time on 166 MHz Pentium-1 computer to get the

answer. Next we discuss how diﬀerent physical observables can be obtained in terms of the

parameters of the wave function. Aspect ratio which characterizes the anisotropy of the

It is easy to verify that ground state is obtained by setting κ and q equal to zero. Once we

have the energy of the states with and without vortices we can calculate the critical angular

velocity for the formation of the vortex state. In the unit of ω0

⊥ it is given by [9]

(28)

(29)

Ωc = κ−1 [(E1/N)κ −

(E1/N)0] .

To demonstrate the applicability of this method we have performed calculations for

87Rb and 7Li. The s wave scattering length is positive for 87Rb.

It is negative for 7Li.

Consequently the interatomic interaction is repulsive in the former and attractive in the

latter. We now present the results and their comparison with the existing calculations.

III. RESULTS

A. Positive scattering length: 87Rb

In this section we report calculations on 87Rb. These atoms interact via a repulsive

interaction and consequently the scattering length in this case is a positive quantity. We

perform our calculations by employing the experimental numbers for the asymmetry pa-

rameter of the trap, the axial frequency and the s wave scattering length corresponding to

the experimental situation of Ref. [1] and the subsequent theoretical calculations [8,9,11].

Accordingly, λ0 = ω0

The corresponding characteristic length is a⊥ = 1.222

×
First, we obtain the energy E1 (Eq.12) by minimizing it with respect to the variational

parameters ω⊥, λ and p for various values of the particle number N. We present the results

in Fig.2. It is evident that the results obtained by us are in close agreement with the results

in Ref. [9](see also Table I below). As pointed out above, these agree well with the results

11

obtained by using the Gaussian trial wave function when N is small and with those obtained

by using the Thomas-Fermi approximation [9,11] when N is very large. These comparisons

clearly establish the validity of our wave function for a very wide range of the particle

numbers.

Next, we compare the proposed wave function with the trial wave function Gaussian

form Eq.(10) and also the one given by the Thomas-Fermi approximation in Fig.3. It is

clear that when the number of atoms in the trap is small the proposed wavefunction has

more resemblence with the Gaussian wavefunction (Fig.3a). As N is increased the wave

function tends to ﬂatten in the central region and the resulting form is a mixture of the

two limiting forms i.e. the Gaussian and the Thomas-Fermi wave function. In the central

region it is close to the latter while it resembles the former away from the trap centre (Fig.3b

and Fig.3c). When N is very large the resemblence is more with the Thomas-Fermi wave

function (Fig.3d). However we note that the wave function vanishes smoothly far away from

the centre of the trap. As mentioned above this a desirable feature which is crucial for the

calculation of some relevent physical observables e.g. the aspect ratio. It is clear that out

wave function not only provides a better lower bound for the energy but also shows the

correct and the desirable limiting behaviour.

Results of calculation of various quantities e.g. chemical potential, total energy , kinetic

energy, potential energy, interaction energy, average size of the condensate in the tranverse

direction and in the axial direction have been presented in Table 1. The close agreement

with the results of Ref. [9] is evident.

We now present the behaviour of the aspect ratio which is a very important quantity

from the experimental point of view . As mentioned in Ref. [9,11] it is equal to √λ0 in the

non-interacting limit and tends to λ0 in the highly repulsive limit, which is the case when N

is very large. However the convergence to the repulsive limit is very slow [9,11] and therefore

this behaviour has not been seen explicitly so far. On the other hand, with a variational

wave function, calculations can be performed for any N with equal ease. Consequently we

have been able to verify the predicted behaviour of the aspect ratio. It is seen from Fig.4

12

that it requires calculations up to N

106 to see the aforesaid behaviour. We note that

∼

the number of atoms in the experiment of Ref. [1] is of the order of 2

104 – quite small to

×

observe the asymptotic behaviour of the aspect ratio.

We plot the variation of the peak density with the particle number N in Fig.5. It is in

good agreement with the result of Ref. [8]. The slow variation of the density is expected

due the repulsive interaction between the atoms. We ﬁnd that the density inreases only by

a factor of 50 as we vary N from 100 to 106. Fig.6 shows the variation of the total loss rate

of the atoms R(N) which is deﬁned in Eq.(16). We take α = 1.3

10−15 cm3 s−1 [8,16] and

×

10−30 cm6 s−1 [8,17]. Once again we ﬁnd good agreement with the result presented

L = 4.0

×
in Ref. [8].

In Fig.7 we show the wave function of the vortex state corresponding to κ = 1 for

N = 5000. The atoms are pushed away from the z axis. Peak density is 7.155

1013 which

×

occurs at r1⊥ = 1.611. The position of the peak moves further away from the z axis as N

is increased. For N = 10000 the peak occurs at r1⊥ = 1.844 while it is at r1⊥ = 2.161 for

N = 20000. Value of the peak density remains much the same for N = 10000 and 20000(

9.524

1013 and 12.26

1013, respectively). We now discuss the behaviour of the critical

×

angular velocity for the state with N. We plot in Fig.8 the critical angular velocity for

the κ = 1 vortex line for various values of N. It decreases rapidly in the begining (up to

N

2000). Thereafter it varies slowly. The result shows good quantitative agreement with

∼

those in the Ref. [8,9]. For example for N = 2000 the critical angular velocity is 52% of the

noninteracting value given by the transverse angular frequency ω0

⊥ of the trap, in comparison

with 49.33% in Ref. [8]. For N > 5000 it is less than 43% of the noninteracting value, which

compares well with the ﬁgure of 40% in Ref. [9]. The critical angular velocity increases with

κ. For N = 10000 we ﬁnd Ωc/2π equal to 30.57, 38.5, and 45.42 Hz for κ =1, 2, and 3

respectively. These ﬁgures are 26, 35, and 41 Hz respectively in Ref. [9].

B. Negative scattering length: 7Li

In this section we report calculations on 7Li. These atoms interact via an attractive inter-

action and consequently the scattering length in this case is a negative quantity. Numerical

values of the parameters used in the calculations correspond to the experimental situation

of Ref. [2] and the subsequent theoretical calculations [9,10]. Accordingly, the asymmetry

parameter of the trap is λ0 = ω0

⊥ = 0.72. The axial frequency ω0

z/ω0

z/2π is taken to be 117

Hz. The s-wave scattering length a is -27a0 . The corresponding characteristic length is

a⊥ = 2.972

10−4 cm and the ratio a/a⊥ is

×

4.33

−

×

10−4.

We ﬁnd the value of the critcal number Nc = 1270 beyond which the ground state

collapses because of the attractive interaction. This is in close agreement with Nc ∼
reported in Ref. [10]. Wave functions for N = 500 and 1270 are shown in Fig.9. For N =

1300

500 there is hardly any diﬀerence between the proposed wave function and the Gaussian

trial wave function. However the diﬀerence is rather signiﬁcant for N = 1270 as is evident

from the ﬁgure. We plot the aspect ratio for various values of N

Nc in Fig.10. At N

Nc

≤

∼

the aspect ratio tends to 1. Since for a wave function of the form given by Eq.(11) the

aspect ratio also gives ratio of spatial widths in the transverse and the axial directions, the

condensate tends to be isotropic for N

Nc. This becomes further evident in Table 2

∼

where we have listed the results for various quantities of interest. As reported in Ref. [9]

the variation in the various quantities is smooth from N = 1 to 1000. However, we can also

note the sharp variation as we reach the critical number. This behaviour is consistent with

that reported in Ref. [10]. We plot the peak density and loss rate in Fig.11 and Fig.12. We

take α = 1.2

10−14 cm3 s−1 [10,16] and L = 2.6

10−28 cm6 s−1 [10,17] for the loss rate

×

calculation. Once again we ﬁnd a sharp increase near N

Nc. These results also match

×

∼

well with those of Ref. [10].

Number of atoms in the trap in the experiments [2] are much larger than Nc calculated

here and reported in other calculations. The discrepency may arise due to existence of the

vortex states [9]. It is possible to have very large number of particles in such states even

14

when the interatomic interaction is attractive. We show in Fig.13 the vortex states with

κ = 1, 2 and 3. The particle number is 3500, 6000 and 8000 respectively. Peak densities

for these states are 1.266

1013, 2.239

1013 and 2.744

1013 which occur at r1⊥ = 0.922,

×

×

×

1.257 and 1.571 respectively. Although the particle number is quite diﬀerent in the three

cases, the peak densities are not not very diﬀerent. Also they remain less than the peak

density 3.984

1013 which corressponds to κ = 0 and N = 1270. These observations are

×

consistent with those in Ref. [9]. Stability of the vortex states for attractive interaction can

be physically explained as the interplay between the restoring force and and the centrifugal

force. The restoring force tries to attract the particles to the centre while the centrifugal

force tries to push them out. The net eﬀect is that the peak density does not change much

even when there is siginiﬁcant variation in the particle number. Since the interparticle

interaction depends on the density, for low dnesities it does not cause the collapse of the

condensate.

In case of attractive interaction it takes more energy to create a vortex state than that

requiread in the noninteracting case. Consequenty the critical angular velocity is greater

than unity. For κ = 1 and N = 1000 we ﬁnd Ωc = 1.119 which compares very well with

Ωc = 1.2 reported in Ref. [9].

IV. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a variational scheme to describe the ground state and vortex states

of weakly interacting atomic gases conﬁned by harmonic traps within the framework of the

meanﬁeld theory of Gross and Pitaevskii . It is based on a judicious choice of the form of

trial wave function for the ground state which has a simple functional form and at the same

time is valid for a wide range of the particle numbers. When the number is small it tends

towards a Gaussian and in the opposite limit it resembles the Thomas-Fermi wave function.

However for large N it is better than the Thomas-Fermi wave function as it provides a better

description of the surface region. In the intermediate regime it combines the feature of both

15

in an eﬀective way.

In the central region of the trap, where density is high, it matches

with the Thomas-Fermi wave function. Away from the centre of the trap, where density

is low, it matches the Gussian trial wave function. We easily generalize the wave function

for the vortex states. We have demonstrated the applicability of our method by performing

calculations of various physical quantities for the experimental situations of Ref. [1] and Ref.

[2]. We ﬁnd our results to be in good agreement with the existing results. The method is

semi-analytic and consequently computationally easy to implement. As our method poses

no additional problems even for very large particle numbers we have been able to verify, for

the ﬁrst time, the predicted behaviour of the aspect ratio. The formalism is quite general

involving only the scaled s-wave scattering length and the asymmetry parameter of the trap.

We therefore believe that it will be useful in analysing a variety of experiments. In addition

it may serve as a very good starting point for the theories [19] where quantum ﬂuctuations

play an important role.

II. ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL OF AN EXTENDED CHARGED SYSTEM

In this article we will discuss a few aspects on the electrostatic potential of an extended

charged system. For convenience we can use the spherical-polar coordinate system.

We will ﬁrst consider points outside the source. Let ~r′(r′, θ, φ) be the position vector
for an inﬁnitesemal volume element dv within the source which makes an angle θ with the
positive Z polar axis and an azimuthal angle φ w.r.t the positive X -axis. Let ~r(r, θT , φT ) be
the position vector of the point of observation (P) making an angle θT with the polar axis
and an angle φT with the positive X -axis. The magnitude of the position vector ~R between
dv and P is then given by:

R2 = r2 + r′′2

where,

r′′2 = r′2[sin2θcos2(φT −

The electrostatic potential at P is given by,

[r2 + r′′2

where r′′, θ

are determined through equ.(47). This expression is valid for all (θT , φT )
α). It is obvious from the above expression that apart from
and (θ, φ) as cos(α) = cos(
−
the monopole term [i.e, the 1
r term] the electrostatic potential for an extended charged
system is anisotropic and depends on the distance (r) and orientation (θT , φT ) of the point of
oberservation [apart from it’s dependence on ρ(r′, θ, φ)]. This is expected as the electrostatic
potential of an ideal electric dipole (with dipole moment ~p) along the positive Z axis and
centered at the origin is [1]:

Vdip(r, θ, φ) =

~p.ˆr
4πǫ0r2

which is anisotropic, i.e, dependent on both r and θ.
The commonly known text book [1] expression for the potential (outside the source) is:

4πǫ0 Z

ρ(r′, θ, φ)r′2sin θdr′dθdφ
[r2 + r′2
2rr′cos(θ)]1/2

For an arbitrary charge distribution characterized by an arbitrary charge-density function
ρ(r′, θ, φ) and an arbitrary ﬁeld point “P (r, θT , φT )” equation (3) agrees with equ.(5) only for
the 1
r terms (the monopole potential terms). Even for a spherically symmetric charge density
the higher order terms diﬀer (for r >> r′) in numerical factors and also through dependence
on θT . We will illustrate this aspect later. Equation (5) for electrostatic potential also suﬀers
from the following limitation:

The electric ﬁeld as obtained from eqn.(5) has only a radial component as the θ-dependent
terms are integrated out. Let us consider an arbitrarily shaped conductor,e.g, a positivly
charged ellipsoidal conductor centerred at the origin. The static electric ﬁeld obtained from
eqn.(5), being radial, will be normal to the conductor surface only at the two poles and at
the equator in contradiction to the electrostatic property of the conductors.

We should note that the exact expression, eqn.(3), for the electrostatic potential at points
out-side the source (for r >> r′) of an extended charged body is in general dependent on
θT , φT . Consequently equ.(3) is not well-deﬁned for points on the polar axis, θT = 0 and
θT = π. This is due to the degeneracy of the azimuthal angle φT at the polar axis and is
discussed in detail in Appendix:E [2]. However, as is apperent from symmetry and is evident
from eqn.(3), this situation arises only when ρ(r′, θ, φ) is explicitly φ dependent. In this case,
the charge density ρ(r′, θ, φ) also is not deﬁned on the polar axis in terms of the azimuthal
angle φ and the only unambigous way to calculate the potential is to use the Cartezian
coordinate system.

For a φ-independent source the integrand in eqn.(3) reduces to the integrand in eqn.(5)
for points on the Polar axis. To calculate the electric ﬁeld for such a source we should ﬁrst
φ) ranging from 0 to 2π; see App.E (i),(ii) [2]] and
perform the φ integration [with (φT −
thereafter take derivatives w.r.t r, θT . We will justify this method in the following discussions.
We now calculate the electrostatic potential for a few spherically symmetric charge dis-

tributions centered at the origin using the expression (3).

We ﬁrst consider the electrostatic potential of a uniformly charged conducting spherical
shell centered at the origin, i.e, we have ρ(r′, θ, φ) = δ(r′
rs)σ where rs is the radius of the
shell. The surface charge density, σ, is independent of θ, φ. For outside points the potential
is given by eqns.(1),(2),(3):

−

V (P ) =

δ(r′
−
[r2 + r′′2

rs)σr′2sin θdr′dθdφ

The potential calculation simpliﬁes considerably if we note that,

r′′ cos(θT −

θ′′) = r′[cos θT cos θ + sin θT sin θ cos(φT −

φ)]

where eqn.(2) and the expansion of cos(θT −

θ′′) is used. Consequently θT and θ terms
in eqn.(3) appear as products justifying a previous discussion regarding the calculation of
the electric ﬁeld. This relation also indicates that for a φ-independent ρ the potential is
independent of φT as discussed earlier.

For points inﬁnitsemally close to the surface of the shell we have,

V (P ) =

From eqns.(8),(9) and (10) we can obtain the values of three deﬁnite integrals. For

The other two deﬁnite integrals obtained from eqn.(9) have values zero.
We now consider the electrostatic potential of spherically symmetric charged sphere,i.e,
ρ = ρ(r′). We ﬁrst make some comments regarding the binomial expansion of the expression:

[sin2θcos2(φT −φ)+cos2 θ−(sin2θcos2(φT −φ)+cos2 θ)1/2cos(θT −θ

together with eqn.(7) give us a series expansion of V (P ) in terms of 1
r and θT (as discussed
below eqn.(7) V (P ) is independent of φT for a spherically symmetric charge distribution).
For example it can be shown that the 1
r2 term, conventionally the dipole term, for V (P )
vanishes indicating that the dipole moment of a spherically symmetric charge distribution
w.r.t any axis vanishes and can be easily veriﬁed by calculating the Z-component of the total
dipole moment. The 1

although the extended charged system is geometrically spherically symmetric, Coulomb’s law
(a fundamental law of Electrodynamics unlike Newton’s law in Gravitation) together with the
principle of superposition (not valid in the General Relativistic description of Gravitation)
give a ﬁnite θT -dependent quadrapole-like term in the binomially expanded expression of
the electrostatic potential. In practice the choice of the polar axis will depend on how the
charged system is conﬁgured.

For points close to the source we will have to use two consequitive binomial expansion:
the ﬁrst one is factoring out (r2+r′′2) in the denomenator of V (P ) and performing a binomial

To ﬁnd the potential on the suface of the source we can follow the procedure used to

study the electrostatic properties of the conductors.

Similar discussions are also valid for points inside the charged system.

III. DISCUSSIONS

In this article we have derived the exact expression for the electrostatic potential of
an extended charged system for points outside the source. It diﬀers from the cnventional
expression through it’s dependence on θT , φT . The anisotropy discussed in this article will
give rise to many interesting predictions in both Celestrial and Terestial electromagnetic
eﬀects.

This article is the only one which gives the proper physical description of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld of an arbitrarily shaped extended system and is capable to describe the behavior
of conductors.

The θT dependence of the far region potential for spherically symmetric charged system
also gives rise to a new set of polynomials. These are the proper set of polynomials to
describe the ﬁeld in the corresponding situation.

The method of derivation provides a mathematically perfect description of the ﬁeld in
situations where the extended nature of the source is relevant and the priciple of superposition
is valid.

The quadrapole-like term of the radial ﬁeld is opposite in direction to that of the

monopole-like term for cos(2θT ) < 2/9, i.e, it gives a screening term.

This article will also have important cosequences in other branches of Physics where the
extended nature of the source is relevant. To illustrate, eqn.(3) gives the proper framework to
study the descripancies between the two descriptions (General Relativistic and Newtonian)
of gravity. To illustrate we conclude the above discussions with a few comments on the
quadrapole-like potential eqn.(60) in the context of the Newtonian description of Gravity

It can further be shown that for small deviations from the equatorial plane (θT = π/2) the
net θT -component of the quadrapole-like force on the extended test-body is always directed
towards the equatorial plane.

Similar results as above regarding the stability of the motion in the equatorial (θT = π/2)
plane are valid in the case of the monopole force which are of more relevance for r >> r′.
However in the limit r >> r′ the net θT force is very small.

Similar comments are valid in the corresponding electrosttic situation with opposite

charges.

IV. COMMENTS ON THE ELECTROSTATIC AND MAGNETOSTATIC LAWS

In this section we will make a few comments regarding the basic laws of Classical Elec-

However for an extended charge distribution ,for points outside the source, we have the
following result for the surface integral ~E. ~da over a spherical surface of radius r (for r >> rs,
rs the radius of the source):

(21)

Here we have used eqn.(1),(2) to evaluate the surface integral of ˆR.ˆr

. Thus
we have a screening-like term, even for the monopole ﬁeld, for the suface integral of ~E as
discussed earlier in the context of the the quadrapole-like potential term.(15).

R2 = (ˆr− ˆr′).ˆr

R2

As usual the curl of ~E is zero.
The no-work law can be regained for the electrstatic ﬁeld of an extended charge distri-
bution if we generalize the derivation properly. The line-integral of ~E over a closed contour
for each element of the source with the source-coordinate remaining ﬁxed is given by:

d ~E.~dl =

Zcontour

Zcontour

∂[dV (R)]
∂R

dR = 0

(25)

and the total work done for the whole source is obviously zero.
Proceeding as above it can be shown that the divergence of ~E outside the source vanishes.
If we consider an annular region outside the source this feature togethar with eqn.(23) show
that the Gauss’s divergence theorm is not valid for an arbitrary source not situated at the
origin.

We now consider the divergence of ~E inside the source. To calculate the divergence at a
point ~r within the source we break the source into two parts: one is an inﬁnitesimal spherical
volume element of radius r′
s centered at ~r and the other is the rest of the source. The electric
ﬁeld is sum of two parts: one due to the inﬁnitesimal volume element (∆v), ~E∆v, and the
other due to the rest of the source, ~Erest. The divergence of ~Erest vanishes for points within
∆v as can be shown from straight-forward calculation. To calculate the divergence of ~E∆v
we can use a spherical coordinate system centered at ~r. The position vector is given by ~r′
~r.

The boundary of (∆v) is given by
s. We also break the charge density into two

ρ∆v(~r′) is non-zero [= ρ(~r′)] for points within ∆v [

s] while ρrest(~r′) is non-zero
[= ρ(~r′)] for points not within ∆v [
s]. However we can take ∆v small enough
|
(considering points near the origin, ∆v can even be of order of the volume of the elementary
particles) so thet ρ∆v(~r′) = ρ(
),i.e, for points within ∆v the charge density is isotropic.

(ii) the volume charge density at the surface of the source vanishes which allows us to
apply Poisson’s equation even for points within the source and inﬁnitesimal close to the
surface (keeping the volume charge density ﬁnite at the surface of the source indicates that
we are introducing a surface charge density)

and assumed that the charge density of the elementary particles are isotropic. In reality,
for points within the source close to the origin, we can always chose ∆v small enough so
that ρ(~r) is isotropic. Anisotropy grows as we move away further from the origin and for
points reasonably away form the origin we can again chose ∆v small enough so that ρ(~r) is
isotropic within ∆v.

For a non-trivial surface charge density the divergence of ~E can be found following the
above procedure with ∆v centered on the surface of the source. In this case the discussions
regarding vanishing of ρ(~r) on the surface of ∆v will be replaced by the corresponding
discussion regarding a line charge density on the periphery of the θ′ = π/2 plane.

We now consider the divergence and curl of the magnetostatic ﬁeld: ~B. The Biot-Savart

Together with the above discussions the laws of Classical Electrodynamics remain un-
changed even in the presence of non-steady currents. However these laws should be sup-

dicussed in the preceding paragraph.

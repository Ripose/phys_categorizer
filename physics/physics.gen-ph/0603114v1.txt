A Thought of Wrapping Space Shuttle External Tank with
Ceramic Fiber Fishnet Stockings

Sun Hong Rhie

ABSTRACT

The new camera system of the shuttle Discovery on STS-114 that blasted
oﬀ at 10:39am, Tuesday, July 26, 2005, after 906 days of grounding since the
Columbia accident, has produced high resolution data of foam sheddings. The
0.9 lbs piece from the Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramp on the LH2 tank is
believed to be comparable in its potential adversities to the ∼ 1.67 lbs BX-250
foam from the −Y bipod ramp that demised shuttle Columbia in 2003. The two
known incidences indicate that protuberant foams, possibly in conjunction with
the liquid hydrogen temperature, oﬀer lame targets of the aerodynamic forces.
Seven other relatively large divots in the STS-114 external tank foam insulation
have been reported, and foam shedding remains to be a challenge to be resolved
before the next space shuttle launch. The relatively large divots from the newly
streamlined foam around the -Y bipod area suggests a potential necessity for a
new line of resolution.

We suggest an option to wrap the insulated external fuel tank with a grid of
high temperature resistant ceramic ﬁbers (ceramic ﬁber ﬁshnet stockings). As-
suming ﬁducial acreage of 20000f t2, one inch square cell single ﬁber grid will
weigh only 60g with ﬁber cost $66. Even with 1500-ﬁber-equivalent strength,
one inch square cell grid will add only 200 lbs and “miniscule” $100,000.

1. Foam Losses on STS-114

While HST customers were crossing their ﬁngers, the STS-114 camera system exhibited
a spectacular scene of a top-hat shape 0.9lbs insulation foam ﬂying oﬀ the external tank.
The public release of the foam loss locations by NASA shown in Fig. 1 read as follows.

2. “Rationale” for an Alternative Resolution

The press release by NASA immediately following the dislodge of the large 0.9 lbs piece
of insulation foam from PAL ramp indicates NASA’s continuing eﬀorts to prevent defects
in foam bubbles and to tame supersonic vortices and turbulences as it reads in the last
paragraph: “... An enhanced spray process is in work for future tanks, as well as continued
work in developing redesign options including elimination of the ramps; reducing the ramps’
sizes by two thirds; or building a trailing edge ‘fence’ on the back side of the cable tray,
which would act like a nozzle throat and prevent unsteady ﬂow in that area.”

The divots in items 2 and 8 in section 1 are from the left side (-Y) of the bipod area.
This is exactly the same area where the ∼ 1.67 lbs piece of foam broke oﬀ from the ramp
and doomed shuttle Columbia in 2003. The ramps have been removed, and the surface of
the foam in the bipod area has been streamlined since. But, the air managed to dump
enough energy to break oﬀ large chunks from the streamlined foam. The fourth volume of
the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) Report1 exhibits a result of hydrody-
namic simulations that shows streamline vortices around the -Y bipod area. We have no
clue, especially not being an expert either in supersonic hydrodynamics or in external tank
conﬁgurations, whether the vortices around the obstacles of the struts that hold the nose of
the shuttle can be tamed without undesirable, or unpredictable and untested, side eﬀects.

However, NASA’s investments of 2.5 years and ∼ 1 billion dollars since Coumbia accident
point to a possibility that the same line of eﬀorts cited in the ﬁrst paragraph of this section
might have already served its capacity.

An alternative is suggested to strengthen the insulated external fuel tank with ﬁsh-net
stockings made of high temperature resistant ceramic ﬁbers that are immediately available.
Oxide ﬁber 3M Nextel 720 manufactured by 3M Technologies is considered.

3. No Foam Loss as Speciﬁed in the Book

3.2.1.2.17 External Tank Debris Limits: No debris shall emanate from the critical
zone of the External Tank on the launch pad or during ascent except for such material which
may result from normal thermal protection system recession due to ascent heating2.

It is the design requirements in “Flight and Ground System Speciﬁcation-Book 1, Re-
quirements” as quoted in CAIB report volume 1 chapter 6, p.122. The report continues,
“The assumption that only tiny pieces of debris would strike the Orbiter was also built into
original design requirements, which speciﬁed that the Thermal Protection System (the tiles
and RCC panels) would be built to withstand impacts with a kinetic energy less than 0.006
foot-pounds.”

The corresponding maximum mass and size of the allowed foam bebris is 0.652g and
∼ 1in3 where the latter is commonly referred to as “the size of a marshmallow” in news media.
The large piece foam debris from the PAL ramp on STS-114 is ∼ 620 times the maximum
allowed. Nextel 720 α-Al2O3 ﬁber properties shown in ﬁgures 2, 3, and 4 (electronically cut
out of 3MTTN) indicate that the ceramic ﬁber technology is suﬃciently mature to meet the
design speciﬁcation of “no foam loss”.

1. In civilized units (cgs or mks), the impact energy limit 0.006 foot-pounds is about
8.13 × 104ergs. Some of the convesion formulae for pressure (or strain) are listed.

spacecraft and wind, air density, streamline, etc, as a function of time and the position
in the external tank. A recent review, found in the web site of Lockheed Martin, “STS-
114 Flight Readiness Review: External Tank (ET-121),” Appendix D, P.5, June 29-30,
2005, indicates that the mass of a foam debris should not exceed ∼ 0.023oz = 0.652g.
The density of the foam is ∼ 2.4lbs/f t3, henced the volume of the inﬁmum mass foam
debris is ∼ 16.96cm3 ≈ 1in3. We take 0.652g and 1in3 as the currently accepted mass
and volume limits.

3. Table 7.2.1.8.1.2.6-1 of CAIB Report titled “Summary of Acreage Stress Analysis Pa-
rameters” lists ﬂight requirement (foam) cell pressures in various parts of the foam
insulation on the external tank: Oxygen tank: 23.6, 19.2, 15.9 psi depending on the
parts; Intertank: 19.7 psi; Hydrogen tank: 16.3 psi, and bond tension test requirement:
30.0 psi. Hence we take 30 psi as the tensile strength requirement of the ceramic ﬁber
grid structure.

3.1. High Temperature Resistant Ceramic Fiber 3M Nextel 720

High tensile strength ﬁbers are based in carbon, SiC, and Al2O3

3. Space shuttle RCC
panels – now a household name since the Columbia accident – are made of carbon ﬁber
composite matrix with SiC protection coating and glassy sealant4,5. During the reentry of
the shuttle, the sealant melts forming an air tight thin ﬁlm. A report6 indicates that oxide
ﬁber tows (or roving: loose bundle of untwisted ﬁbers) perform better than SiC-based tows
in the condition under consideration where it is highly oxidating and the usage time is short
(q < 30000). The interactions within the bundle make the tow weaker or stronger in terms
of creep or rupture in comparison to the average strength of the single ﬁber. At 1200◦C ,
single ﬁber SiC outperforms SiC tow; At 1400◦C, SiC tow outperforms single ﬁber SiC. We
consider an oxide ﬁber 3M Nextel 720.

3M Nextel 720 ﬁber7 is a continuous ﬁber with the composition of 85% Al2O3 and
15% SiO2, melting temperature 1800◦C , density 3.40g/cm3, the ﬁlament tensile strength

2100MP a(300ksi) at 25.4mm guage, the diamter ∼ 12µm, and the crystal phase α-Al2O3+mullite.
Nextel oxide ﬁbers are various mixtures of Al2O3, SiO2, and B2O3. Fiber 610 is made of
pure Al2O3 (> 99%) and its crystal phase is α-Al2O3.

Figure 2 shows the stable strength of ﬁber 720 tow in high temperatures. (3M Nextel
oxide ﬁber tows come in ﬁber counts of 400 or 750.) Figures 3 and 4 show the single ﬁber
tensile strengths of the ﬁbers 610 and 720 in room temperature and high temperatures
where the high temperature heatings lasted about 90 seconds. (Note that the maximum
aerodynamic friction and heating occurs around 80 seconds after the launch.) The ﬁber 610
is stronger at room temperature, but ﬁber 720 is preferred because of the stability of the
strength in high temperatures. Comparision of ﬁgures 2 and 4 shows that the ﬁber 720 tow
performs better than single ﬁber at higher temperatures (> 1150◦C) consistently with the
report by DY.

The concern of foam shedding is on the area where the aerodynamic stress is high, and
the design requirement8 of the temperature tolerance due to aerodynamic heating is 1200◦C
. Within the temperature range, ﬁber 720 shows excellent strength behavior and also very
slight diﬀerence in the strengths between a tow and an average single ﬁber. The temperature
tolerance requirements for the areas with heating from solid rocket booster and from main
engine are very high with 1650◦C and 3300◦C. Foam shedding or ablation from those areas
(aft dome and lower part of the acreage) is not a concern in regard to the potential damage
to the thermal protection systems (TPS), and reinforcement ﬁbers should not be used to
avoid generating unnecessary potential hazard of loose ﬁber fragments or melts.

3.2. Added Mass Estimation

1. The total acreage of the external tank foam insulation is ∼ 24000f t2. (The total mass
of the foam is ∼ 4800lbs.) The area that needs ﬁber reinforcement is likely to be less
than 20000f t2, and 20000f t2 will be considered the ﬁducial acreage. Most of the foam
loss seems to come from intertank area where liquid oxygen tank and liquid hydrogen
tank are joined (CAIB report).

2. Consider a single ﬁber one inch square cell grid. The number of cells in the grid is
2, 880, 000, the total length of the ﬁber in the grid is 5, 760, 000 in, and the total mass
is 60 g. (According to 3MTTN, 400 ﬁber count tow has 1500 denier (denier = number
of grams in 9000 m or 10000 yd of a product).) Assuming absolute no failure of the

– 6 –

single ﬁber grid, added weight of 60 g of ﬁbers will keep the foams from being released.
It is most likely not practicable, but the negligibly small mass of the single ﬁber grid
is a good news. The cost of the single ﬁber grid will be $66. It is only getting better.

3. The tensile strength measurement is done with a short piece of ﬁber of length 25.4 mm,
and I did not ﬁnd failure probability of long ﬁbers in 3MTTN. The total strength
equivalent of 400 or 750 ﬁbers of the commercial products may be more than fail-safe
for the lengths of the girth and height of the appication area of the external tank. One
can consider woven yarns or very narrow fabric to replace the single ﬁber strand for
the grid. The ceramic ﬁber net may be embedded near the surface of the foam or wrap
the surface. A 1500 ﬁber-equivalent strength grid will add mass ∼ 200 lbs with the
price tag of $100,000.

The analysis is preliminary and the mass estimation is made over a broad range because
of the lacking information of the properties of long ﬁbers, exact behavior of the insulation
foam under stresses, and so the engineering formulation of the grid. For example, the foam
will have surface waves generated by the aerodynamic ﬂows, and the ﬁber (yarn) would need
to have certain elasticity whether the ﬁber grid is embedded or on the surface.9 The proper
elasticity may be engineered through the bundle structure such as braiding or weaving.
Inelastic ﬁber can act as a “diamond string saw” to an adverse eﬀect. Even if it shaves oﬀ
only benignly small pieces, it should be best to avoid generating additional foam ﬂakes.

In summary, a ceramic-ﬁber-grid reinforcement can eliminate foam-shedding problem.
The projected mass and price of the grid are small. There are some details to be speciﬁed to
engineer a practical ceramic-ﬁber grid that will secure insulation foam of the external tank
– economically. “No foam loss” makes the ﬂight safer and reduces turn-around repair costs.
We call for cooperations from the interested parties.

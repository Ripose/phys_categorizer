Can the atomic spectra be explained by classical electromagnetic ﬁeld theory?

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

We study the energy conversion laws of the macroscopic harmonic LC oscillator, the electro-
magnetic wave (photon) and the hydrogen atom. As our analysis indicates that the energies of
these apparently diﬀerent systems obey exactly the same energy conversion law. Based on our
results and the wave-particle duality of electron, we ﬁnd that the atom in fact is a natural mi-
croscopic LC oscillator. In the framework of classical electromagnetic ﬁeld theory we analytically
obtain, for the hydrogen atom, the quantized electron orbit radius rn = a0n2, and quantized energy
En = −RHhc/n2, (n = 1, 2, 3, · · · ), where a0 is the Bohr radius and RH is the Rydberg constant.
Without any adaptation of the quantum theory, we present a reasonable explanation of the Zeeman
eﬀect, Selection rules and Pauli exclusion principle. Our results show that the concept of electron
spin is not the physical reality and should be replaced by the intrinsic characteristic of the heli-
cal moving electron ( Left-hand and Right-hand). In addition, a possible physical mechanism of
superconductivity is also provided.

INTRODUCTION

No one doubt that twentieth century is the century
of quantum theory.1−13 After 100 years of development
quantum physics is no longer just a ﬁeld, it is the bedrock
of all of modern physics. Although the modern quantum
theory has provided a beautiful and consistent theory
for describing the myriad baﬄing microphenomena which
had previously deﬁed explanation,4 one should not ne-
glect a curious fact that quantum mechanics never take
into account the deep structures of atoms. In fact, at the
heart of quantum mechanics lies only the Schr¨odinger
equation,6 which is the fundamental equation governing
the electron. According to quantum theory, it is the
electromagnetic interaction (by the exchange of photons)
which hold electrons and nuclei together in the atoms.
But, up to now, quantum theory never provides a practi-
cal scheme that electron and nuclei can absorb and emit
photons.
In this paper, we investigate the energy re-
lationship of electron in the hydrogen atom and ﬁnd a
process of perfect transformation of two forms of energy
(kinetic and ﬁeld energy) inside the atom and the conser-
vation of energy in the system. By comparing to known
results of the macroscopic harmonic LC oscillator and
microscopic photon, we ﬁnd that electron kinetic energy
in fact is a kind of magnetic energy and the atom is a
natural microscopic LC oscillator. Moreover, we try to
interpret some quantum behavior of microscopic particles
in a much more acceptable way.

a process of perfect periodically transformation of two
forms of energy (kinetic energy Ek = 1
2 meu2 and ﬁeld
energy Ef = e2/2Cr) inside the atom and the conserva-
tion of energy in the system

Recall the macroscopic harmonic LC oscillator where
two forms of energy, the ﬁeld energy Ef = Q2
0/2C of
the capacitor C (carrying a charge Q0) and the mag-
netic energy Em = LI 2
0 /2 of the inductor L, are mutu-
ally exactly interconvertible (Etotal = Ef = Em) with a
exchange periodic T = 2π√LC. And for a microscopic
photon (electromagnetic wave), the maximum ﬁeld en-
ergy Ef = 1
2 ε0E2
0 and the maximum magnetic energy
Em = 1
2 µ0H 2
0 also satisfy Etotal = Ef = Em. Based on
the above energy relationship for three totally diﬀerent
systems and the requirement of the electromagnetic in-
teraction between electron and nuclei, we assure that the
kinetic energy of electron (Eq. 2) is a kind of magnetic
energy and the hydrogen atom is a natural microscopic
LC oscillator.

Here raise an important question: how can the elec-
tron function as an excellent microscopic inductor? We
think the answer lies in the intrinsic wave-particle dual-
ity nature of electron. In our opinion, the wave-particle
nature7 of electron is only a macroscopic behavior of the
intrinsic helical motion of electron within its world.

III. CHIRALITY AND INDUCTANCE OF FREE

In 1923, Broglie suggested that all particles, not just
photons, have both wave and particle properties.7 The

associated with an amount of magnetic energy.

A. Orbital Magnetic Moment and Lamb Shift

where λ is called de Broglie wavelength, h is Planck’s
constant1 and p the momentum of the particle. The sub-
sequent experiments established the wave nature of the
electron.11,12 As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), based on
Eq. 5 and the demanding that the electron would be a
microscopic inductor, we propose that a free electron can
move along a helical orbit (the helical pitch is de Broglie
wavelength λe) of left-handed or right-handed. In this pa-
per, the corresponding electrons are called “Left-hand”
and “Right-hand” electron which are denoted by S = 1
1, respectively. Hence, the electron can now
and S =
be considered as a periodic-motion quantized inductive
particle which is called “inducton” (see Fig. 2). More-
over, the particle-like kinetic energy of electron can be
replaced with a dual magnetic energy carried by a “in-
ducton”. Therefore, we have

By the application of helical electron orbit to the hy-
drogen atom (Fig. 2), we can not only explain the sta-
bility of the atom but also give a theoretical interpreta-
tion of the atomic spectra. Fig. 3 shows four possible
kinds of stable helical electron orbits in hydrogen atom,
and each subgraph corresponds to a electron of diﬀerent
motion manner within the atom. The electrons can be
distinguished by the following two aspects. First con-
sider the chirality of electron orbits, as shown in Fig. 3,
the electrons of Fig. 3(a) and (c) are “Left-hand” la-
belled by S = 1, while electrons of Fig. 3(b) and (d)
are “Right-hand” labelled by S =
1. Secondly con-
sider the direction of electron orbital magnetic moment
µL, Fig. 3(a) and (b) show that the µL are in the Z

direction (out of paper) while (c) and (d) in the
rection, the corresponding electrons are labelled by J = 1

tum number. Hence, the electrons of diﬀerent physical

FIG. 3: The quadruple degenerate stable helical electron or-
bits in hydrogen atom.

Now, in the framework of helical electron orbit, the
electron orbital magnetic moment is allowed naturally to
be both positive (J = 1) and negative (J =
1), there-
fore, the double splitting experiment5 is a immediate re-
sult of our theory. It seems that the electron spin9 no
long as an essential quantum number in our studies. In
our opinion, the concept of electron spin may be wrong
and the so-called spin induced quantum phenomena can
now be explained perfectly by our quantum numbers.

−

Furthermore, take a look at Fig. 3(a), three diﬀerent
“inductons” with diﬀerent de Broglie wavelengths (or )
λr, λ+ and λ− are deﬁned. Here we should stress that λr
in fact is invalid in a system of circular motion. To illus-
trate this ideas, let us examine the three situations care-
fully, for case of λr, both ends of the “inducton” doesn’t
fall in the XY plane and electron travelling through these
two locations has a nonzero radial velocity, in this case
we think the quantized “inducton” deﬁned by λr is un-
stable thus invalid in the system. But, for the other two
cases of λ+ and λ−, both ends of these “inductons” fall in
the XY plane, at the same time the corresponding radial
velocity of the travelling electrons is zero, in other words,
these two “inductions” described by λ+ and λ− are stable
and can function as the “inductions” of the studied sys-
tem. In fact the Bohr theory of hydrogen electron orbits
are a approximate treatment of the corresponding heli-
cal orbits, the real helical orbit can contribute two “real

inductions” in the atom. It is these two “inductions” of
λ+ and λ− that ﬁnally lead to the Lamb shift.13

B. Quantized Radius and Energy

Just for the purpose of making a comparison between
our results of LC mechanism and the known results of
quantum theory, we ﬁrst study the system of λr (the
corresponding induction is called “virtual induction”).In
this case, the LC parameters of the hydrogen atom is il-
lustrated in Fig. 3. Then the corresponding LC resonant
frequency is

νr =

1
2π√LrCr

e
4πλr√πε0mer

.

Recall the well-known relationship E = hνr, we have

Combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 10 gives

hνr =

λr =

The stable electron orbits are determined by

2πr

= n, (n = 1, 2, 3

),

(12)

· · ·

which shows that the orbitals allow the electron wave to
complete one or more integer de Broglie wavelength (or
integer number of “induction”). From Eq. 11 and Eq.
12, the quantized electron orbit mean radius is given by

rn =

where a0 is Bohr radius. And the quantized energy is

where RH is Rydberg constant. Surprisingly, the results
of Eq. 13 and 14 are in excellent agreement with Bohr

that the quantized energies of Eq. 14 are quadruple de-
generate.

V. SOME DISCUSSIONS

To interpret atomic spectra completely and neatly, the
Zeeman eﬀect, the selection rules and the Pauli exclu-
sion principle should be considered. In the following, we
expect that our theory can describe these problems in a
more reasonable way.

A. Zeeman Eﬀect

When atomic spectral lines are split by the applica-
tion of an external magnetic ﬁeld, it is called the Zeeman
eﬀect14. The Zeeman eﬀect in hydrogen atoms showed
the expected equally-spaced triplet. Quantum theory ex-
plains this by the spin-orbit interaction. By Fig. 5, we
can also interpret qualitatively this puzzling experimen-
tal result. As shown in Fig. 5, when applied an exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld in Z direction, the electron (J = 1
or m > 0) will be pushed to the higher energy states

C. Pauli Exclusion Principle and
Superconductivity

Up to now, the Pauli exclusion principle is still puz-
zling to researchers. It states that no two electrons in a
single atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.
Our viewpoint about this question is quite diﬀerent. As
shown in Fig. 7, two electrons (with the initial phases dif-
ference π) of diﬀerent chirality (S = 1 and S =
1) can
move closely in a DNA-like15 double helical electron or-
bit. Note that, for both cases (J = 1 or J =
1) the two
helical moving electrons are equivalent to a pair of par-
allel electric currents, by the classical theory, these two

currents (or electrons) are attracted each other and the
corresponding electrons are called coherent electrons (or
superconducting electrons). If more electrons are added
in the same helical orbit, the coherence between the pre-
vious two paired electrons will be destroyed.

Finally, we would like to give a brief discussion about
superconductivity. It is no doubt that the studies of the
mechanism of superconductivity were, and still are, a
challenging physical problem. As shown in Fig. 7, our
mechanism provides a vivid and solid physical picture
where two electrons can be in pairing. We assume, for
any kinds of superconductors, that the Tc has the form:
Tc ∼ λ−ξ
, where λe is the electron de Broglie wavelength
e
and ξ (> 1) is a index number. The only diﬀerence among
the superconductors is the λe of the paired electrons. Any
conﬁnement of electrons will deduce the λe and help to
form the paired electrons, thereby, increase the supercon-
ductivity temperature Tc. In our opinion, it is the helical
motion which causes the pairing of electrons (Left-hand
and Right-hand) and leads to superconductivity. For any
stable atoms of nature, the closed-shell electrons are nat-
urally in pairing and the corresponding atoms are the
natural one-dimensional superconductors.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have shown that the helical moving
electron can be regarded as a inductive particle (“induc-
ton”) while atom as a microscopic LC oscillator then
the indeterministic quantum phenomena can be well ex-
plained by the deterministic classical theory. Moreover,
what has been called the ”electron spin” is really the in-
trinsic chirality of the electron of helical motion. Our LC
mechanics force us to rethink the nature and the nature
of physical world.
It would be very important to note
that it is the periodic interconversion of the atomic ﬁeld
energy and magnetic energy (similar to that of photon
1
2 ε0E2
0 ) that ﬁnally determines the physical
properties of atom. We are convinced that the universe
was built in the simplest manner and all things in it are
unique and deﬁnitive.

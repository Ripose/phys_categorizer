Abstract

The Hamilton-Jacobi theory of Classical Mechanics can be ex-
tended in a novel manner to systems which are fuzzy in the sense
that they can be represented by wave functions. A constructive inter-
ference of the phases of the wave functions then gives us back Classical
systems. In a suitable description this includes both Quantum The-
ory and General Relativity in the well known superspace formulation.
However, there are several nuances which provide insight into these
latter systems. All this is considered in this paper together with suit-
able generalization, to cascades of super universes.

1 Introduction

The Hamilton-Jacobi theory of Mechanics is well known [1]. Let us now
look at this theory from a slightly diﬀerent perspective which enables its
generalization to situations which cannot be described purely classically. As
is usual we start with the action integral

and extremalize it [2, 3]. Let us denote, working for the moment in one space
dimension for simplicity, the extremum integral of (1) by

where p denotes the momentum and E denotes the energy. We can combine
(3) and (4) and write,

In view of the description given in (6), (7) and (8) take on a more general
character in terms of the so called dynamical phase S . Further as is well
known, the requirement

∂S

= 0

which denotes a constructive interference in the phase of systems described
by wave functions leads us back to a classical particle description as in (4).
We will now apply the above theory to Quantum Mechanical systems and
General Relativity.

Equation (10) is easily recognized as the equation of continuity and (11) as
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in three dimensions. At this stage there is still
no surprise because the Bohmian description given in (10) and (11) as aris-
ing from the Schrodinger equation (9) describes a Quantum Theory without
observers, essentially a deterministic Quantum Theory [4].
However the surprising result comes when we start with the stochastic ap-
proach of Nelson, that is

Equation (12) describes a Brownian or Diﬀusion process and can be shown
to lead back to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (11) once it is realized that the
right time derivative is not equal to the left time derivative [5, 6]. Equally
surprising is the fact that the Feynman path integral method [7, 8, 9] requires
an integrability condition, which is the same as (12) and this gives us back
the Hamilton-Jacobi description (7) and (8). We would like to emphasize in
both of these approaches, that we are dealing with an ensemble of paths and
it is only a constructive interference which singles out a particle like path,
whereas in the Bohm description or in Classical Physics, there is an actual
trajectory.

3 General Relativity

We now come to Wheeler’s description of the wave function of the universe
in terms of superspace (Cf.ref.
[2, 3]). Superspace is a manofold such that
a single point therein represents the whole of the geometry of three dimen-
sional space. As is usual we denote such a three dimensional geometry by
(3) . Treating this as a point we introduce the wave function like description
(6), except that we are in superspace which is essentially a four dimensional
manifold. We summarize this situation following Wheeler. Interestingly it
ha s been shown by Stern that a long as we are dealing with Euclidean
type three dimensional spaces with positive deﬁnite metric, superspace con-
stitutes a manifold in the sense that each point therein has a neighborhood

homeomorphic to an open set in a Banach space and two distinct points are
separated by disjoint neighborhoods. This enables us to carry out the usual
operations in superspace and we are led back using the principle of construc-
tive interference to this time the ten ﬁeld equations of Einstein.
Thus the Hamilton-Jacobi theory leads both to Quantum Mechanics and to
General Relativity in terms of the wave function description (6) together
with constructive interference. However it must be borne in mind that in
Quantum Mechanics we are dealing with the usual three dimensional space
whereas for obtaining the Einstein’s equations of General Relativity, we are
using the four dimensional superspace.
We can generalize the concept of superspace by considering rather than a
four dimensional manifold a set of three dimensional universes, without im-
posing any conditions of smoothness or even continuity. Let us consider as
above, the three dimensional space as a ”point”. It has been argued in detail
by the author [5] that at the scale of the radius of the universe, the behavior
mimics the Quantum behavior but with a scaled up Planck constant given
by

(Cf. also [9]). It can then be argued that the radius of the universe corre-
sponds to the Compton wavelength of a particle and is given by

where M is the mass of the universe. Indeed one can argue that these scaled

Not only does (18) give the correct value of the Hubble constant, but it is also
Weinberg’s “mysterious” empirical relation, giving the pion mass in terms of
the Hubble constant or vice versa.
Thus the expansion of the universe is due to the decay of the wave packet.

In fact we can push the above considerations even further. We could consider
Quantum eﬀects to the super universe which is now not Wheeler’s superspace
but a collection of universes. In this case as in the explanation for voids in
the universe [12], we could consider the diﬀerent universes to be diﬀerent
quantized levels in a super atom. This time we get for a typical distance R

4 Remarks

1. We note that there is a rationale for the four dimensionality considered
above. It has already been showed by the author (Cf.ref.[10] for a detailed
discussion) that at the resulution of the Planck scale the universe can be
considered to be a one dimensional array of Planck oscillators [13]. A simple
way to see this is to observe that if there are N ′ such coherent oscillators, at
the Planck scale, then the total extent R is given by,

It has also been shown [14] that N ′
of the universe. So also the mass of the universe is given by

10120. So (21) gives us back the radius

(21)

(22)

10−5gms is the Planck mass. Equation (22) gives us the correct

where mP ∼
mass of the universe.
However the scale of the elementary particles is the Compton scale and it has
been argued that at this scale we encounter two dimensionality (Cf.ref.[5]).
(In fact if there is a collection of ultra relativistic particles, then it is known
that the centres of mass form a two dimensional disc [15]). Well outside the

R = √N ′lP

M = mP √N ′

Compton scale we encounter three dimensionality as it manifests by inverse
square Coulomb or gravitational forces. Furthermore we have

M = ρR3, ρ

10−29gm/cc

∼
ρ being the average density of the universe, as we should have for three
dimensions. If now the universe as a whole is treated as having the scaled
up Compton scale extension then well beyond this scale we should have by
the same reasoning an extra that is fourth space dimension. This in fact
is Wheeler’s superspace. Our variation has been that this four dimensional
space has not been taken as a manifold, but rather as a set where neither
smooth nor continuum properties are assumed.
In the above considerations it is interesting to note that the universe itself
shows up as a black hole (Cf.ref.[5]). This is brought out by the fact that the
radius of the universe resembles the Schwarzchild radius, that is

R

∼

2GM
c2

Furthermore the time taken by light to reach an observer at the centre from
the periphery is also the time taken by light to traverse this distance in an
equivalent black hole: This is the age of the universe.
2. In the above we have generalized the Feynman path integral and stochastic
approaches, valid for elementary particles to the case of the entire universe
treated as a wave packet as we saw in equations like (14), (16) etc. On the
other hand these two approaches relying on (12) show that we cannot go
down to arbitrarily small space time scales for then we would encounter in-
ﬁnite velocities. In fact as Feynman put it [7],
“... these irregularities are such that the “average” square velocity does not
exist, where we have used the classical analogue in referring to an “average.”
“If some average velocity is deﬁned for a short time interval ∆t, as, for ex-
ample, [x(t + ∆t)
¯h/(ım∆t).
That is, the “mean” square value of a velocity averaged over a short time
interval is ﬁnite, but its value becomes larger as the interval becomes shorter.
It appears that quantum-mechanical paths are very irregular. However, these
irregularities average out over a reasonable length of time to produce a rea-
sonable drift, or “average” velocity, although for short intervals of time the
“average” value of the velocity is very high...”
This immediately provides a rationale for considering a non smooth set (in-
stead of Wheeler’s superspace) as discussed in detail in reference [9].

x(t)]/∆t, the “mean” square value of this is

However it must be reiterated that in Wheeler’s superspace approach General
Relativity appears as a four space dimensional generalization of the Quantun
wave function (6). This is again brought out in our approach where we have
used the Gaussian wave packet for the universe as in (16) by the fact that
(20) in fact leads to the Weinberg formula or equivalently to (18) giving the
gravitational constant G in terms of microphysical parameters l, m, h and N
the number of particles in the whole of the universe. In other words grav-
itation appears due to not microphysical considerations but rather due to
considerations at the scale of all the particles in the universe [16].
3. In the Gaussian packet for the universe, the decay which appears as a
Hubble expansion as in (17) can also be thought as due to a time varying G
which follows from (18) as [17]

The loss of energy due to (23) leads to the decay of the wave packet for in this
case of the Gaussian packet [10] we have, the spread of all the N elementary
particles that is the spread of the universe given by

(24)

In fact (24) is an alternative form of (18).
4. In fact a similar consideration as above can explain the decay of a Planck
mass particle to an elementary particle in the Compton time (Cf.ref.[9]). The
same arguments can now apply with scaled Schrodinger equationsto multiple
universes.
5. The process by which the Planck oscillators condense into elementary
particles which then constitute our universe can continue using the scaled
Planck constants and we have a multiplicity of universes uı forming a super
universe ¯u, say. There could be a multiplicity of super universes ¯uj and so
on - nothing that we know really forbids such a self similar indeﬁnite con-
struction. At each stage however we would be going to higher and higher
dimensions, just as a super universe would require four space dimensions.
6. We ﬁnally make a few comments: For the past few years several as-
tronomers and physicists have come round to the view that our universe is
only a tiny constituent of a multiverse. In the words of David Deutsch of
Oxford University [18] “A growing number of physicists, myself included, are
convinced that the thing we call ’the universe’- namely space, with all the

8

matter and energy it contains - is not the whole of reality. According to
quantum theory - the deepest theory known to physics - our universe is only
a tiny facet of a larger multiverse, a highly structured continuum containing
many universes.”
This view replaces the earlier Wheeler concept of multiple universes con-
nected by gravitational wormholes (Cf. discussion in ref.[5]). The more re-
cent view arises from the big bang singularity and stems from the realization
that at this point of singularity, it is impossible to predict physical behavior
or physical laws. On the other hand our universe itself appears to be highly
ﬁne tuned in the sense that even a minute departure from the values of the
fundamental constants would lead to a very diﬀerent type of a universe - in
particular one which may not be able to support any life at all. In this view,
which is in the spirit of the anthropic principle, there would be several uni-
verses, and ours is merely one with the right parameters. As the well known
astronomer Martin Rees put it, “Our universe may be just one element, one
atom as it were - in an inﬁnite ensemble.... each universe starts with its own
big bang, acquires a distinctive imprint (and its individual physical laws) as
it cools, and traces out its own cosmic cycle. The big bang that triggered
our entire universe is, in this grander perspective, an inﬁnitesimal part of an
elaborate structure that extends far beyond the range of any telescopes.”
In any case it has been realized that by thinking that our observable uni-
verse is all there is, we may be as naive as the pre-Copernican scholars who
believed that the earth was at the centre of the universe. In fact it is being
speculated that there may be something like 10500 universes like our own!
In our approach, we indicate how the concept of super universes can be de-
scribed on a mathematical footing. Let us start with the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation (11), but in four dimensions, a la Wheeler. At this point we depart
and consider the generalized solinoidal velocity ﬁeld

In (26) h1 is the scaled up Planck constant encountered before. In the usual
theory, it has been argued that the analogue of (26) describes a multiply

precisely the equation behind the scaled up Compton wavelength (14). This
would also be the spin of the universe demonstrated by Godel for the Einstein
equations. A cosmic footprint for these considerations may have already been
found in the anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
[5]. From this point of view each of the universes contained in the four
dimensional super universe would be no more than the counterpart of the
spinning elementary particle, not to mention the super super universes.
To press these considerations further we note that we can use the Beckenstein
temperature formula for a black hole [20]

T =

hc3
8πGkm

kT = Mc2

If in (27), we replace h by h1 and the mass m by M, the mass of the universe,
then we get

This is consistent, as the right side is the energy content of the universe.
Further the decay time in this black hole theory is given by

In (28) with the scaled up Planck constant and the mass of the universe we
get, the age to be

Then with this factored in we ﬁnd that (29) holds approximately.
We can then speak of the force between the diﬀerent universes within the
super universe. This would follow from a generalization of (30) which gives
the gravitational force between the N particles of the universe. If we take the

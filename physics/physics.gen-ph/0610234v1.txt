Abstract

Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation means that one observer cannot know
an exact position and velocity for another (ﬁnite mass) observer. By con-
trast, the Poincare transformation of classical special relativity assumes
that one observer knows the other’s position and velocity exactly. The
present paper describes a simple-minded way to consider the issue using a
semiclassical discussion of spacetime diagrams, and draws out some possi-
ble implications. A consideration is raised regarding the use of light-cone
coordinates.

1 Introduction

In an early paper on quantum mechanics [1], Heisenberg noted that his uncer-
tainty principle applies to observers as well as to observed systems. Heisenberg
noted that the quantum uncertainties in an observer O1’s position and mo-
mentum, in another observer O2’s coordinates, are subject to his uncertainty
principle:

This uncertainty relation means that O2 cannot know both O1’s position and
velocity exactly at the same time in O2’s coordinates. One expects this to be
more signiﬁcant at short time and distance scales, as the uncertainties become
a larger proportion of the scales. By contrast, the Poincare transformation of
classical special relativity assumes that one observer knows the other’s position
and velocity exactly.

Heisenberg noted that his uncertainty relation was a problem for relativity,
and postulated that any practical eﬀect of observer indeterminacy could be
eliminated by allowing the observer’s mass to approach inﬁnity. However, a
large observer mass warps spacetime.

There have been a number of approaches to the general issue of making
special relativity and quantum mechanics consistent, e.g. see [3]. The present
paper (based on a 2001 draft) describes a simple way to consider observer trans-
formations using spacetime diagrams, and draws out some possible implications.
Another recent preprint [4] has discussed observer transformations, particularly
the notion of a superposition of transformations. The present paper might possi-
bly be considered as discussing the possible nature of individual relative-velocity
components of such a transformation. The present author also recalls seeing an
archived paper around 2001 that discussed the notion of a superposition of ref-
erence frames in the context of non-commutative geometry. A further recent
preprint [5] has discussed the concept of quantum reference frames, with partic-
ular regard to precision optical experiments with transmitters and receivers at
rest relative to each other. Another recent paper [6] has expressed a view that
theoretical physics should give more thought to observers and reference frames.

This paper uses the basic Heisenberg uncertainty relation. The relation for
position and momentum is a fuzzy relation:

We now drop the label i, and consider a spacetime with 1+1 dimensions.
Using the relativistic relation v = p/pp2 + m2

for now that O2 can be said to have a frame, and setting c = 1 here), we have

will be asymmetrical; the higher-v tail will be squashed. In the non-relativistic

Hypothetically, if O2 could measure O1’s velocity with zero uncertainty,
∆xO1 would be inﬁnite. One might think that this could correspond to some
extent with the classical relativistic picture of an inﬁnitely extended observer
with clocks and rods extending throughout spacetime, if spacetime has inﬁnite
extent. But by the positions of O1 and O2, we really mean the positions of the
origins of those reference frames; O2 has inﬁnite uncertainty about where O1’s
origin is. Alternatively, if one can consider a Feynman path integral approach [2]
to the motion of O1, even if two path endpoints are precisely ﬁxed, there are
many possible paths consistent with those endpoints. A classical limit would
pick out the path that extremises the action, but in quantum mechanics one has
a superposition of all possible paths, each of which contributes to an interference
pattern.

3 Classical spacetime diagram

Let O1 and O2 be the origins of classical inertial observers, in a spacetime with
one spatial dimension and one time dimension. We will call O2’s coordinates
x2 and t2. Suppose that the origin of O1 passes through x2 = b when t2 = a,
and that O1’s velocity relative to O2 is v in the positive x2 direction.

Relativity texts show O1’s and O2’s t and x axes in a simple spacetime
diagram. For technical reasons graphs are not included in this paper, but the
description of the spacetime diagram is simple. O2’s axes t2 and x2 are drawn

2

perpendicular to each other. O1’s axes t1 and x1 are lines drawn in the ﬁrst
quadrant of the diagram. The classical Poincare transformation relating the
co-ordinates of O2 to those of O1 is x2 = γ(x1 + vt1) + b, t2 = γ(t1
vx1) + a,
where γ = 1/√1

v2 and c = 1. In O2’s frame, O1’s time axis is the line

4 Spacetime diagram with quantum uncertainty

What happens to O1’s coordinate axes in the simple classical spacetime diagram
when O2’s measurements of O1 are made subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle? We will assume that O2 has an inertial reference frame and its axes
stay the same as above. We will ignore the backreaction of O2’s measurements
on O2’s reference frame. The analysis could be considered to be semi-classical.
We will also refer to O1 as meaning O1’s origin, where appropriate.

Let us suppose that for times t2 < 0, O2 has established that O1s velocity
in her frame is approximately v in the direction of increasing x2. Let a = 0 = b.
At t2 = 0, with uncertainty ∆t2, O2 observes that O1 passes through x2 = 0,
with an uncertainty ∆x2. The x2 measurement introduces an uncertainty of the
order of ∆v into O2’s knowledge about O1’s velocity, where ∆v is given by the
equality within equation 4. We assume that O1’s clock reads exactly zero when
O2 makes the measurement. (This assumption could be changed.)

Let us suppose that O2 uses a simple Poincare transformation to estimate
O1s coordinates, with the parameters of the transformation now having uncer-
tainties.
In a spacetime diagram, O2 could incorporate the uncertainties by
drawing a number of diﬀerent lines to represent possibilities an O1 time axis,
and a number of possible lines to represent an O1 spatial axis. All of these sets
of axes for O1 are options as far as O2 knows. Because O2 cannot assume or
prove O1 to be an inertial observer, O2 could more appropriately portray O1’s
axes as smears rather than lines. But for the sake of simplicity, let us continue
with a number of speciﬁc sets of possible axes for O1, and understand them to
indicate a smearing.

In the new spacetime diagram, O2’s axes look perpendicular to each other,
just the same as before. O1’s axes are changed. For any particular value of the
parameters (velocity, a, and b) that one might choose within their uncertainties,
a pair of time and space axes for O1 can be drawn. For example, if we choose
a particular value for the velocity within the uncertainty ∆v from v, we could
draw with slopes v and c2/v:

-a pair of axes for O1 that intersect at (
-a pair of axes for O1 that intersect at (
-a pair of axes for O1 that intersect at (+∆x2,
-a pair of axes for O1 that intersect at (+∆x2, +∆t2).

At each point P and Q, a pair of axes for O1 could be drawn for the velocity
v + ∆v, and a pair of axes can be drawn for v
∆v. But we will focus on the
axes for velocity v. It will be assumed that the speed of light is constant and
equal for O2 and O1.

The time axis for O1 that goes through point Q intersects the spatial axis
for O1 that goes through point P. These two lines roughly deﬁne a fuzzy region
near O2’s (0,0) point, a spacetime region that could be considered as a kind of
no man’s land, where O2 cannot say much if anything about what O1 perceives
as time and what O1 perceives as space.

The time axis for O1 that goes through point Q - let us call this line L1 - is

given by the equation

x2 = v(t2 + ∆t2) + ∆x2

The spatial axis for O1 that goes through point P - let us call this line L2 -

Results for other velocities can be derived by substituting them for v above.
If (v + ∆v) is substituted in, xc and tc contain the products ∆x2∆v and ∆t2∆v
in the numerator, and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle could produce some
interesting non-classical results.

There are two interesting limits: the v

uncertainty principle.

It seems that in a graded way, O1’s concept of time and space becomes to
some extent less accessible to O2, the faster O1 is moving relative to O2. By
contrast, classical relativity makes a sharp distinction between inertial observers
with v < c and entities moving at the speed of light. Classically, any inertial
observer with v < c can compute another such observers coordinates exactly,
but this cannot be done for entities moving at the speed of light.

What might an actual value for xc be, for observers with high relative speed?
If ∆t2 is zero, xc

might think that this would generate a conﬂict with experiments; [8] has noted
that these show Lorentz invariance down to 10−18 m. But there need be no
conﬂict. Nothing in the present paper necessarily inﬂuences Lorentz or Poincare
invariance; the issue here is rather how to describe transformations between
reference systems to begin with. However, it might be interesting to consider
whether quantum uncertainties involved in observers’ reference systems might
mask Lorentz invariance violations arising from other theories.

It might also be interesting to consider the implications (if any) of these
results for the use of light cone coordinates in physics. If the use of such coordi-
nates is tantamount to the formal limit of a Poincare transformation multiplied
by an overall scale factor, it may be necessary to consider quantum uncertainties
in the coordinate transformation; non-commutative geometry probably does this
automatically. This comment is subject to the proviso that the above analysis
is a simple semi-classical one, and may not capture all of the relevant eﬀects. It
might however be suggestive.

7 Speculative discussion

This paper does not attempt to construct a consistent theory of quantum me-
chanics and special relativity. Perhaps an observer could be described by a
quantum mechanical superposition of classical inertial reference frames; each
frame and amplitude in a superposition might be labelled by a pair (a, p), in
1+1 dimensions. The Poincare transformation might be adaptable accordingly.
A superposition of transformations has been discussed in [4]. The relevant con-
cepts may depend on how observers are deﬁned.

The sections above considered a spacetime with one spatial dimension. It
may be interesting to speculate about behaviour in two or more spatial dimen-
sions. If the simple working above is correct, O2 cannot completely distinguish
O1’s t and x coordinates. In 2 spatial dimensions, it seems likely that O2 can-
not completely distinguish O1’s t and y coordinates. Perhaps O2 cannot then
completely distinguish O1’s x and y coordinates, and perhaps a species of non-
commutative geometry can reﬂect this. Although non-commutative geometry
is generally considered as applicable at high energies, at least one author has
previously noted that it may be useful in lower-energy contexts.

The sections above assumed that the observer O2 could be taken to have a
classical inertial reference frame. However, O2 will in practice be aﬀected by
quantum ﬂuctuations. This would most likely smear out the overall picture even
more. O2 will also be subject to a backreaction from its measurement of O1.
These factors have not been considered in the present paper.

Relativity could perhaps be modiﬁed by considering more realistic observers
and conﬁgurations of measuring devices than that assumed for classical inertial
reference frames. Such observers might have limited access to information; they
might not have passive instantaneous access to all information about events at
a distance and their coordinates, as assumed by the classical picture of an ob-
server with access to readings of an inﬁnite number of clocks and rods. Perhaps
a Lagrangian could combine contributions from the observed system, ﬁrst-tier
observing devices, and second-tier observers such as aspects of human obser-
vation, in some parametrisation. A second-tier observer might extrapolate or

6

derive coordinates for spacetime as a whole using information from ﬁrst-tier de-
vices in a way that uses an explicit model for the second-tier observer’s notion
of spacetime. Regarding Lagrangians, it is noteworthy that work is ongoing in
relativistic two-body and many-body classical mechanics, e.g. [7].

Abstract

Using only the reciprocity postulate, it is demonstrated that the spatial separation of two
objects, at rest in some inertial frame, is invariant. This result holds in both Galilean and
special relativity. A corollary is that there are no ‘length contraction’ or associated ’relativity of
simultaneity’ eﬀects in the latter theory. A thought experiment employing four unsynchronised
clocks and a single measuring rod provides a demonstration of the time dilatation eﬀect. This
eﬀect, which is universal for all synchronised clocks at rest in any inertial frame, is the unique
space-time phenomenon discriminating Galilean and special relativity.

PACS 03.30.+p

In the conventional presentation of special relativity theory (SRT), following the ap-
proach of Einstein’s seminal paper on the subject [1], light signals and clock synchro-
nisation play a crucial role in the development of predictions of space-time geometrical
eﬀects on the basis of the Lorentz transformation (LT). However, as early as 1910 [2], it
was realised that Einstein’s methodology is not the only, and not the most economical,
way (in terms both of the number of postulates and their simplicity) to formulate the
foundations of SRT.

In a previous paper by the present author [3], using a similar approach to Ref. [2],
it was shown that only two weak, and, from a naive point-of-view, ‘evident’ postulates,
unrelated to classical electrodynamics or any other dynamical theory, suﬃce to derive the
LT. This is true for events lying along the common x, x′ axis of two frames S and S’ in
which the latter frame moves with constant velocity along the x-axis in S. All kinematical
and space-time geometrical predictions of SRT may be derived from this LT. The two
postulates are that, the LT must be a single-valued function of its arguments, and a
restricted form of the special relativity principle that may be called the ‘Measurement
Reciprocity Postulate’ (MRP):

Reciprocal space-time measurements of similar measuring rods and clocks
in two different inertial frames by observers at rest in these frames give
identical results

In order to derive the LT for events not lying along the common x, x′ axis, the further
postulate of spatial isotropy is required. This is, to the present writer’s best knowledge,
the minimum number of postulates, to date, from which the LT has been derived [3]a

aEinstein stated explicitly only two postulates in Ref. [1], but at least three other postulates:

linearity of the

equations, spatial isotropy, and the reciprocity postulate (see below) were also tacitly assumed.

1

The aim of the present letter is to present a simple thought experiment involving four
identical unsynchronised clocks A, B, A’ and B’ and a single measuring rod, R, that
displays all essential predictions of SRT concerning measurements of length and time
intervals in the inertial frames S and S’. The results obtained below from the analysis of
the thought experiment are the same as those presented in previous papers [4, 5, 6] by
the present author. Some are quite diﬀerent from those deduced, following Einstein, from
the conventional interpretation of the LT in SRT. Although the experimentally-conﬁrmed
Time Dilatation (TD) eﬀect is predicted in the same way as in conventional SRT, neither
the Relativity of Simultaneity (RS) nor the Length Contraction (LC) eﬀects are predicted
to occur. Indeed, the distance between two physical objects at rest in S’ as measured in
either S or S’ is found to be a Lorentz-invariant quantity [7]. It is interesting to note that,
at the time of this writing, there is no experimental evidence for the existence of either
the RS or LC eﬀects [4]. Two Earth-satellite experiments have recently been proposed
to test for the existence of the RS eﬀect [8].

In order to specify a length interval, two distinct physical objects or a single extended
one are required. For the present study it is found more appropriate to consider two
distinct objects, which may be chosen to be identical clocks at two diﬀerent spatial
locations. This choice will be found of importance for discussion of the existence (or not)
of the RS eﬀect. Since the analysis will involve length intervals in the two inertial frames
S and S’, it follows that the minimum number of distinct objects needed to perform
reciprocal measurements in S and S’ is four, –two A,B in S and two A’,B’ in S’. It will be
convenient to use unsynchronised clocks for the four objects A, B, A’ and B’, although
for the analysis of length intervals as measured in S or S’ (relevant to the existence, or
not, of LC) it is of no importance that the objects are clocks. Any others – located at
the same well-deﬁned spatial locations– can be employed. For the discussion of the TD
eﬀect the clocks are, of course, essential.

At the start of the experiment, as shown in Fig.1a, the clocks A’ and B’ are placed in S
above the x-axis, a distance, L, apart. The measuring rod, R, of length, L, is used to set
the positions of the clocks. The clocks A and B are similarly set the same distance apart,
using R, below the x-axis. Again, using R, the initial separation of B’ and A is set to 2L
and the origin of the x and x′ axes is chosen midway between B’ and A. Initially, then,
the coordinates of the clocks are: xA′ = x′
A = L and
A′ =
−
xB = x′
B = 2L. The clocks A’ and B’ are initially at rest but are equipped with identical
mechanisms that accelerate them in the positive x-direction for a time tacc in the frame S.
After this they move with the same uniform velocity vF (see Fig.1b) . For deﬁniteness, it
is assumed that a constant acceleration, a, is applied in the proper frames of the clocks.
The acceleration procedure is started simultaneously in S by signals from the generator
SG which is connected via the identical cables C(A’) and C(B’) and movable contacts to
A’and B’. When the button Bu is pressed, simultaneous signal pulses P(A’) and P(B’)
propagate along the cables (Fig.1a) and are detected by the accelerating mechanism in
A’ and B. At time t = 0, according to a clock in S, both A’ and B’ start to accelerate
in the direction of A and B. The velocities and positions of the clocks are given by the

R, of length L is used to set the initial separation of the clocks. On pressing the button Bu, the signal
generator, SG, sends simultaneous pulse-signals P(A’) and P(B’) along the identical cables C(A’) and
C(B’) to A’ and B’, respectively. On arriving at the clocks, these signals initiate identical acceleration
programmes for the clocks as described in Eqns(1) and (2). b) After the time t = tacc = √3 (in units
where c = a = 1), the clocks move with the uniform velocity vF = √3/2 along the x-axis, separated
by the distance L. The video camera, VC, records the passage of the clocks (see text for discussion).

The x v t plot of the motion of A’ and B’ in S is shown in Fig.2a, in units where a = c = 1
and where tacc = √3. At time t = Tsimul, A,A’ and B,B’ are, simultaneously, spatially
L/vF A,B’ are contiguous and at t = Tsimul + L/vF
contiguous while at t = Tsimul
B,A’ are contiguous (see Fig.2a and Fig.3). In order to derive the sequence of events that
would be observed from the co-moving frame b S’ of A’ and B’, it is necessary to connect
the velocities of A’ and B’ relative to the frame S, just considered, to the velocities of
A and B relative to the frame S’. This connection is given by the Reciprocity Postulate
(RP) [10, 3]. The RP relates the relative velocities of two objects in the frames in which
either one, or the other, is at rest. It can be considered as a generalisation to two reference
frames (whether inertial or accelerated) of the formula relating the velocity of A relative
to B, vBA, to that of B relative to A, vAB, in a single frame of reference:

-v. Many authors (including Einstein in Ref. [1]), treat the RP as ‘obvious’ and do not
even cite it as a separate postulate when deriving the LT.

In fact, the RP has been demonstrated in a rigorous manner, by Berzi and Gorini [10]
to be a consequence of the special relativity principle, space-time homogeneity and spatial
isotropy. In Ref. [3] it is shown to follow, alternatively, from single-valuedness of the space
time transformation equations and the MRP stated above. The RP plays a crucial role
in the derivation of the LT in Ref. [3]. At an intermediate stage in the proof it is found
that:

So that the universal constant, V , is deﬁned as the maximum possible relative velocity of
two inertial frames. Relativistic kinematics shows that V is also the velocity of a massless

assumed that light consists of massless particles –photons, in which case V = c [3].

It is important to note that the RP holds in both special relativity and Galilean
relativity. Indeed, relative velocities deﬁned exactly as in Eqn(6) are the arguments of
the parallel velocity addition formulae of both SRT:

and Galilean relativity:

vA′A =

vA′A′′ + vA′′A
1 + vA′A′′vA′′A/c2

vA′A = vA′A′′ + vA′′A

The interest of the RP for the present discussion is that it connects inﬁnitesimal space
and time intervals in the frames S and S’ at any instant, whether the frames are inertial
or accelerated. Introducing ﬁnite time intervals of equal size δt = δt′ in S and S’c Eqn(6)

Eqn(11) implies that the x′ v t′ plots for A,B,A’ and B’ may be derived from those of
x v t in Fig.2a by reﬂection of the latter in the x-axis, noting also that xA and xB are
constant in S and x′
B are constant in S’. The overall eﬀect (see Fig.2b) is to reﬂect
B′ and
all curves in the x-axis and to exchange their labels: A′
A′. It can be seen that the spatial coincidences AB’, AA’ simultaneous with BB’,
B
and BA’, occur at the same times whether viewed in S (Fig.2a) or in S’ (Fig.2b).
In

virtue of this the spatial coincidences shown in Fig.3 at the times: Tsimul
and Tsimul + L/vF are valid in both S and S’. The frames S and S’ are inertial when these
spatial coincidences occur.
It is clear from inspection of Figs.2 and 3 that the events
corresponding to the spatial coincidences of AA’ and BB’ are simultaneous in both S and
S’ –there is no RS, and that the distance between both A and B and that between A’
and B’ is equal to L at all times – there is no LC eﬀect. This conﬁrms the conclusions of
earlier analyses [4, 5, 6] based on the use of a ‘local’ LT. Here the absence of RS and LC
is shown to follow directly from the RP, (6), without invoking the LT.

The curves shown in Fig.2 recall a phenomenon that the reader may have noticed when
sitting in a train that has halted at a station. On the adjacent track are the carriages of
another train. At a certain moment the person in the train, looking out of the window,
thinks that his train has started, as the carriages of the adjacent train are seen to acclerate
to the right. The last carriage passes and the person sees, with surprise, that his train
is still stationary. Or, it may happen that instead the scenery outside is seen to be
also moving to the right, at almost the same speed as the last carriage of the adjacent
train, and the traveller is reassured that her journey is proceeding. In the ﬁrst case the

cNote that these time intervals are independent and are set equal for convenience in evaluating the integrals in
Eqn(10). t and t′ are the proper times in these frames. The arbitary condition δt = δt′ should not be confused with
the time dilatation formulae (to be discussed below) δt = γδ˜t′ and δt′ = γδ˜t where δ˜t′ is a time interval of a clock at
rest in S’ observed from S and δ˜t is a time interval of a clock at rest in S observed from S’.

adjacent train acclerates to the right. In the second case the observer’s train acclerates,
in an identical manner, to the left. A physicist equipped with an accelerometer, could, of
course, easily distinguish the two cases. But if the acceleration programmes of the trains
are the same and oppositely directed, the space-time experience of the observer in the
two cases is identical. If a video camera were used to record the relative motion of the
adjacent train in the two cases, the recordings would be identical and indistiguishable. In
Fig.1 the video camera VC records the motion of the objects A’ and B’ as they accelerate
to the right and then move with the uniform velocity vF . If VC were accelerated in an
identical manner to the left, the recording of the objects A’ and B’ would be the same
as that obtained in the conditions of Fig.1. A consequence of this is that all the space
time curves shown in Fig.2 (in which A’ and B’ accelerate to the right in Fig.1) would be
identical if, instead, A and B were accelerated, in an identical manner, to the left.

from S, at the events labelled in Figs.2 and 3 by the proper times Tsimul
L/vF , Tsimul
and Tsimul + L/vF are, as shown in Fig.4: tA(B′), tA(A′), tB(B′), tB(A′), ˜tB′(A), ˜tA′(A),
˜tB′(B) and ˜tA′(B). Here ti(j), ˜ti(j) are times recorded by the clock i when it is in spatial
coincidence, in the x-direction, with the clock j, ˜t is the apparent time of a moving clock
as viewed from the other inertial frame i.e. clocks with proper frame S’, viewed from S
or clocks with proper frame S viewed from S’. These eight observed times constitute the
raw data of the thought experiment that will now be analysed using SRT.

In order to avoid possible problems associated with a particular choice of coordinate
system –indeed, as will be shown below, just such a problem is at the origin of the misin-
terepretation of the LT in conventional SRT– the experiment will be analysed entirely in

Eqns(14) and (15) are the SRT predictions of the TD eﬀect for the clocks B’ and A’ in
the thought experiment. Note that clock synchronisation plays role and so is irrelevant for
the analysis. The same is true of actual experimental veriﬁcations of TD. In the CERN
2 experiment [12], the time interval ∆t between the production and decay of
muon g
muons with γ
30 was measured directly using clocks in the laboratory system, whereas
the average value of ∆˜t was the rest frame muon mean lifetime. In other, more typical,
particle physics experiments ∆t is determined from the relation ∆t = d/v where v is
the particle velocity determined kinematically as v = pc2/E, or by direct time of ﬂight
measurement [13], and d is the distance between the production and decay positions of
the particle. In no case is it necessary to consider synchronised clocks.

≃

Consider now the spatial separation between A’ and B’ at the time Tsimul in either S or
S’. Since (see Fig.2) ∆t = ∆t′ = 0 (the AA’and BB’ spatial coincidences are simultaneous
in both S and S’) (12) gives simply:

The spatial separation of B’ and A’ is therefore a Lorentz-invariant quantity [7].

By considering the clocks A and B as viewed from the frame S’ (see Fig.5) the times:
tB′(A), tA′(A), tB′(B), tA′(B), ˜tA(B′), ˜tA(A′), ˜tB(B′) and ˜tB(A′) may be recorded. Re-
peating the above analysis using these observed times leads to the following results for

At this point, the analysis of the four-clock thought experiment, based only on the
RP, Eqn(6), and the invariant-interval relation, (13), has derived the TD eﬀect for all four
clocks and demonstrated the Lorentz-invariant character of the spatial separations of the
clocks in each frame. There are no RS or LC eﬀects. The analysis has been performed
observing the clocks at rest in S’ from S (Fig.3 and 4) or observing the clocks at rest in S
from S’ (Fig.3 and 5). Indeed, the simultaneous events in S considered above, such as the
initialisation times of the acceleration programs of A’ and B’, or the spatial coincidences
AA’ and BB’, are simultaneous in any inertial frame whatever, i.e. the simultaneity of
these events is absolute, not relative.

This is illustrated in ﬁg.6 which shows the space-time paths of the four clocks as
viewed from the inertial frame S” that moves with velocity u along the negative x-axis.

Inspection of the geometry of Figs.2 and 6 reveals that the fundamental reason for
the simultaneity of the events corresponding to the AA’ and BB’ spatial coincidences is
x+L transforms
translational invariance. For example, In Fig.2a, the transformation x
the space-time curves of A and A’ into those of B and B’, respectively. The simultaneity
is a ncessary consequence of the similar shapes of the space-time curves of A and B and
of A’ and B’. Even if the acceleration process were to modify the time t’ recorded by the
clocks in S’ as compared to that shown in Fig.2b, which would change the shapes of the
A and B space-time curves during acceleration, the events AA’ and BB’ would remain
simultaneous, providing that the clocks were aﬀected by acceleration in a similar manner.
The time dilatation formulae (15)-(18) can be simpliﬁed by synchronising the clocks
at the instant of the AA’ and BB’ spatial coincidences. As suggested in Ref. [5], the
clocks can be stopped, set to zero, and started at the instant when A and A’ and B and
B’ are spatially contiguous. This means that in Eqns(14) and (15):

→

and in Eqns(17) and (18):

tA(A′) = ˜tB′(B) = tB(B′) = ˜tA′(A) = 0

tA′(A) = ˜tB(B′) = tB′(B) = ˜tA(A′) = 0

Thus (14),(15),(17) and (18) may be written as:

tA(B′) = γF ˜tB′(A)
tB(A′) = γF ˜tA′(B)
′
tA′(B) = γF ˜tB(A
)
tB′(A) = γF ˜tA(B′)

tA(B′) = tB(A′)

It then follows that (32) or (33) may be written simply as ts = γF ˜t′
s where ts is the time
of all synchronised clocks at rest in S, and ˜t′
s is the apparent time of all synchronised
clocks, at rest in S’, as viewed from S, while (34) or (35) may be written as t′
s = γF ˜ts
where t′
s is the time of all synchronised clocks at rest in S’ and ˜ts is the apparent time of
all synchronised clocks, at rest in S, as viewed from S’.

A complete description of the space-time behaviour of the clocks A, B, A’ and B’,

after synchronisation, is then given by the equations:

The equations involving spatial coordinates (38),(39) and (41),(42) are the same as in
Galilean relativity. Eqns(39) and (42) can be seen, by diﬀerentiating (37) with respect
to ts and (40) with respect to t′
s, to embody the RP. Eqns(40) and (43), describing the
TD eﬀect, are unique to SRT and are an example of the MRP.

Eqns(38) to (43) can also be derived directly from the LT [4, 5, 6], but care is needed

to deﬁne correctly the time oﬀsets t0 and ˜t′

0 in the LT for unsynchronised clocks:

Synchronising the clocks according to Eqn(30) at the proper time Tsimul in both S and
S’ determines the constants t0 and ˜t′
0 in (44) and (45), with the results, for the clocks A’
and B’:

Eqns(46) and (48) are equivalent to (38) and (39). while using (46) to eliminate xA′ from
(47) or (48) to eliminate xB′ from (49) yields Eqn(40).

The spurious RS and LC eﬀects result from the use of an incorrect LT to describe the
time displayed by a clock. For example, suppose that the x′ coordinate of B’ is inserted
into the LT (46) and (47) appropriate for the clock A’, at the time ts = 0. Since x′
L
and x′

where, in the last member of (51), (50) has been used to eliminate xB′. Since at ts = 0,
˜t′
Eqns(46) and (47) give xA′ = L and ˜t′
s = 0, (50) and (51) may be written as:

(52) expresses LC and (53) RS, since, in S, tA′ = tB′ = ts = 0.
It can be seen that
they result from the incorrect subsitution of the coordinates of B’ in the LT appropriate
for A’. Other discussions of the spurious nature of the RS and LC eﬀects can be found
elsewhere [4, 5, 6, 14].

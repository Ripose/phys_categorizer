Abstract

The ordinary linear quantum theory predicts the quantum correla-
tions at any distance (the universal superposition principle). It creates
the decoherence problem since quantum interactions entangle states into
non-separable combination. On the other hand the linear quantum theory
prevents the existence of the localizable solutions, and after all, leads to
the divergences problem in the quantum ﬁeld theory. In order to over-
come these diﬃculties the non-perturbative nonlinearity originated by the
curvature of the compact quantum phase space has been used.

1 Introduction

Non-linearity in quantum theory has been invoked in order to build the objective
quantum theory and to prevent the unlimited spread out of the observable ﬁelds
by the gravitational self-potential [1, 2]. But Newtonian quantum gravity in the
present form is not eﬀective for the shaping wave-packets of elementary particle
size since the characteristic scale of the ground-state wave-packet obtained from
the gravitational Schr¨odinger equation for nucleon masses is around 1023m [2].
There is a diﬀerent group of works that emphasize the formulation of the
standard quantum mechanics in quantum phase space (QPS) represented by the
complex projective Hilbert space CP (N − 1) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. I think, however,
that a consistent and proliﬁc theory based on such QPS should be connected
with serious deviations from the standard quantum scheme. Such a modiﬁcation
must, of course, preserve all achievements of de Broglie-Heisenberg-Schr¨odinger-
Dirac linear theory in a natural way. One may think about attempts to establish
a deductive approach to the quantum theory.

Standard quantum mechanics (QM) treats electron as pointwise particle but
it is ‘wrapped’ in so-called de Broglie-Schr¨odinger ﬁelds of probability. Quan-
tum ﬁeld theory (QFT) uses same classical space-time coordinates of the point-
wise particle as ‘indices’ whereas the ﬁelds are operators acting in some Hilbert

1

state space (frequently in Fock space). QM and QFT take account of the non-
commutative nature of the dynamical variables but the interaction between
pointwise particles and the relativistic invariance are borrowed from the classi-
cal theory. These are the sources of the singular functions involved in QFT. It
is useful to understand the true reason of these diﬃculties.

The special and general relativity are based on the possibility to detect
locally the coincidence of two pointwise events of diﬀerent nature. As such the
“state” of the local clock gives us local coordinates - the “state” of the incoming
train [8]. In the classical case the notions of the “clock” and the “train” are
intuitively clear. Furthermore, Einstein especially notes that he does not discuss
the inaccuracy of the simultaneous of two approximately coincided events that
should be overcame by some abstraction [8]. This abstraction is of course the
neglect of ﬁnite sizes (and all internal degrees of freedom) of the both real clock
and train. It gives the representation of these “states” by mathematical points
in space-time. Thereby the local identiﬁcation of two events is the formal source
of the classical relativistic theory. But in the quantum case it is impossible since
the localization of quantum particles is state-dependent [9, 10, 11]. Hence the
identiﬁcation of quantum events (transitions) requires a physically motivated
operational procedure with corresponding mathematical description.

Therefore it is inconsistent to start the development of the quantum theory
from the space-time symmetries because just the space-time properties should
be established in some approximation to internal quantum dynamics, i.e. liter-
ally a posteriori. Namely, the quantum measurement with help of the “quantum
question” leads locally to the Lorentz transformations of its spinor components,
and, on the other hand, to dynamical (state-dependent) space-time coordina-
tization. That is, instead of the representation of the Poincare group in some
extended Hilbert space, I used an “inverse representation” of the SU (N ) by
solutions of relativistic quasi-linear PDE in the dynamical space-time. It is in
fact the one of the possible realizations of L. de Broglie idea about the “wave
with a hump” [12].

In the present article I propose a non-linear relativistic 4D ﬁeld model origi-
nated by the internal dynamics in QPS CP (N − 1) [13, 14]. This is the develop-
ment of the ideas used in [15]. There is no initially distinction between ‘particle’
and ‘ﬁeld’, and the space-time manifold is derivable. Quantum measurements
will be described in terms of parallel transport of the local dynamical variables.

2 The Action Quantization

Schr¨odinger sharply denied the existence of so-called “quantum jumps” during
the process of emission/absorption of the quants of energy (particles) [16, 17].
Leaving the question about the nature of quantum particles outside of consider-
ation, he thought about these processes as a resonance of the de Broglie waves
that phenomenologically may look like “jumps” between two “energy levels”.
The second quantization method formally avoids these questions but there are
at least two reasons for its modiﬁcation:

2

First. In the second quantization method one has formally given particles
whose properties are deﬁned by some commutation relations between creation-
annihilation operators. Note, that the commutation relations are only the sim-
plest consequence of the curvature of the dynamical group manifold in the vicin-
ity of the group’s unit (in algebra). Dynamical processes require, however, ﬁnite
group transformations and, hence, the global group structure. The main my
technical idea is to use vector ﬁelds over a group manifold instead of Dirac’s
abstract q-numbers. This scheme therefore seeks the dynamical nature of the
creation and annihilation processes of quantum particles.

Second. The quantum particles (energy bundles) should gravitate. Hence,
strictly speaking, their behavior cannot be described as a linear superposition.
Therefore the ordinary second quantization method (creation-annihilation of
free particles) is merely a good approximate scheme due to the weakness of
gravity. Thereby the creation and annihilation of particles are time consuming
dynamical non-linear processes. So, linear operators of creation and annihilation
(in Dirac sense) do exist as approximate quantities.

POSTULATE 1.

There are elementary quantum states |¯ha >, a = 0, 1, ... belonging to the Fock
space of an abstract Planck oscillator whose states correspond to the quantum
motions with given number of Planck action quanta.

One may image some “elementary quantum states” (EAS) |¯ha > as a
quantum motions with entire number a of the action quanta. These a, b, c, ...
takes the place of the “principle quantum number” serving as discrete indices
0 ≤ a, b, c... < ∞. Since the action in itself does not create gravity, it is possi-
ble to create the linear superposition of |¯ha >= (a!)−1/2(ˆη+)a|¯h0 > constituting
SU (∞) multiplete of the Planck’s action quanta operator ˆS = ¯hˆη+ ˆη with the
spectrum Sa = ¯ha in the separable Hilbert space H. Therefore, we shall pri-
marily quantize the action, and not the energy. The relative (local) vacuum of
some problem is not necessarily the state with minimal energy, it is a state with
an extremal of some action functional.

Generally the coherent superposition

may represent of a ground state or a “vacuum” of some quantum system with
the action operator

Such vacuum is more general than so-called “θ-vacuum” of QCD

a=−∞
X
It is clear that |F >= |θ > if f 0 = 1,
f n = 2 cos(θn) for n = 1, ... and if |θ > is
absolutely convergent series. The “winding number” a has here diﬀerent sense
as it was mentioned above.

a=0

ˆS = ¯hA(ˆη+ ˆη).

The space-time representation of EAS’s and their coherent superposition is
postponed on the dynamical stage as it is described below. We shall construct
non-linear ﬁeld equations describing energy (frequency) distribution between
EAS’s |¯ha >, whose soliton-like solution provides the quantization of the dynam-
ical variables. Presumably, the stationary processes are represented by stable
particles and quasi-stationary processes are represented by unstable resonances.

The action functional

S[|F >] =

< F | ˆS|F >
< F |F >

,

(4)

has the eigen-value S[|¯ha >] = ¯ha on the eigen-vector |¯ha > of the operator
¯hA(ˆη+ ˆη) = ¯hˆη+ ˆη. This deviates in general from this value on superposed states
|F > and of course under a diﬀerent choice of ˆS = ¯hA(ˆη+ ˆη) 6= ¯hˆη+ ˆη. In order
to study the variation of the action functional on superposed states one need
more details of geometry of their superposition.

In fact only ﬁnite, say, N elementary quantum states (EQS’s) (|¯h0 >, |¯h1 >
, ..., |¯h(N − 1) >) may be involved in the coherent superposition |F >. Then
H = CN and the ray space CP (∞) will be restricted to ﬁnite dimensional
CP (N − 1). Hereafter we will use the indices as follows: 0 ≤ a, b ≤ N , and
1 ≤ i, k, m, n, s ≤ N − 1. This superposition physically corresponds to the
complete amplitude of some quantum motion. Sometimes it may be interpreted
as a extremal of action functional of some classical variational problem.

The global vacuum |¯h0 > corresponds to the zero number of action quanta in
the places of the Universe far enough from stars with pseudo-Euclidean metric
in accordance with the
POSTULATE 2.

‘Mach’s quantum principle’:
the Universe generates the omnipresent average
self-consistent cosmic potential coinciding with the fundamental constant g00 =
ΦU = c2.

Matter exists in the motion with a ﬁnite number of the action quanta. The
mass of some quantum particle gives the rate of variation of the Universe po-
tential ΦU = c2 in accordance with the de Broglie frequency ω = mc2
¯h . There-
fore omnipresent ΦU = c2 serves as a “spring” of the “local internal clock”
showing rather the state-dependent time τ than the “world time” of Newton-
Stueckelberg-Horwitz-Piron [18].

Dynamics of the global vacuum state |¯h0 > or the ground state of some
problem |G > should be sensitive to mass/energy distribution and, hence, to
the rate of variation of the Universe potential ΦU = c2 = GN
. If one assumes
that the universal linear density ρU = MU
= 1.349×1027[kg/m] preserves
RU
in some wave process with a mass m per one wave length λ = vphT = 2πvph

ω = ¯h
i.e. m

λ = ρU then using the universal Einstein-de Broglie relation m

This wave process is necessarily realized on the Planck’s scale because we
treated the global vacuum deformation only as a linear one-dimension wave
perturbation of ΦU = c2 whereas the quantum ground state moves in fact in the
Hilbert space H. One needs to study the general law of motion (“deformation”)
of ray of the action state in the CP (N − 1). The wave propagation attendant to
this “deformation” serves as “inverse representation” of SU (N ) in the dynamical
(state-dependent) space-time (see below).

Since any ray of the action amplitude has isotropy group H = U (1) × U (N )
only the coset transformations G/H = SU (N )/S[U (1)×U (N −1)] = CP (N −1)
eﬀectively act in H. Therefore the ray representation of SU (N ) in CN , in partic-
ular, the embedding of H and G/H in G, is a state-dependent parametrization.
Hence, there is a diﬀeomorphism between the space of the rays marked by the
local coordinates in the map Uj : {|G >, |gj| 6= 0}, j > 0

(j) =

(5)

and the group manifold of the coset transformations G/H = SU (N )/S[U (1) ×
U (N − 1)] = CP (N − 1). This diﬀeomorphism is provided by the coeﬃcient
functions Φi
α of the local generators (see below). The choice of the map Uj
means, that the comparison of quantum amplitudes refers to the amplitude with
the action ¯hj. The breakdown of SU (N ) symmetry on each action amplitude
to the isotropy group H = U (1) × U (N − 1) contracts the full dynamics down
to CP (N − 1). The physical interpretation of these transformations is given by
the

POSTULATE 3.

The unitary transformations of the action amplitudes may be identiﬁed with
physical ﬁelds; i.e., transformations of the form U (τ ) = exp(iΩαˆλατ ), where the
ﬁeld functions Ωα are the parameters of the adjoint representations of SU (N ).
The coset transformation G/H = SU (N )/S[U (1) × U (N − 1)] = CP (N − 1) is
the quantum analog of a classical force; its action is equivalent to some physically
distinguishable variation of GCS in CP (N − 1).

Thus the quantum dynamics in the CP (N − 1) is similar to general rela-
tivity dynamics, where due to the equivalence principle, gravity is locally non-
distinguishable from an accelerated reference frame [19]. But in general relativ-
ity one has the distinction (by deﬁnition) between gravity (curvature) and its
‘matter’ source. In quantum physics, however, all physical ﬁelds are ‘matter’
and variation of these ﬁelds leads to the variation of basis in the state space.

3 Non-linear treatment of the eigen-problem

The quantum mechanics assumes the priority of the Hamiltonian given by some
classical model which henceforth should be “quantized”. It is known that this
In order to avoid the ambiguity, I intend to use a
procedure is ambiquous.

quantum state itself and the invariant conditions of its conservation and per-
turbation. These invariant conditions are rooted into the global geometry of
the dynamical group manifold. Namely, the geometry of G = SU (N ), the
isotropy group H = U (1) × U (N − 1) of the pure quantum state, and the coset
G/H = SU (N )/U (1)×U (N −1) geometry, play an essential role in the quantum
state evolution (the super-relativity principle [20]). The stationary states (some
eigen-states of action operator, i.e. the states of motion with the least action)
may be treated as initial conditions for GCS evolution. Particulary they may
represent a local minimum of energy (vacuum).

inﬁnite dimension will be discussed later.

solutions of this system may be expressed through the Cramer’s rule

It is easy to see that these solutions being substituted into the ﬁrst omitted
equation give us simply re-formulated initial characteristic equation of the eigen-
problem. Therefore one has the single valued ray solution of the eigen-problem
expressed in local coordinates instead of the vector solution with additional
freedom of a complex scale multiplication.

This approach does not give essential advantage for a single operator and it
only shows that the formulation in local coordinates is quite natural. But if one
tries to understand how the multi-dimensional variation of the hermitian opera-
tor included in a parameterized family, the local formulation is inevitable. First
of all it is interesting to know the invariants of such variations. In particular, the
quantum measurement of dynamical variable represented by hermitian N × N
matrix should be described in the spirit of typical polarization measurement of
the coherent photons [22]. I will put below the sketch that depicts the mod-
ulation measurement of the photons polarization state during the operational
“travel” on the Poincar´e sphere.

The initial state of the coherent photons |x > is modulated passing through
an optically active medium (say using the Faraday eﬀect in YIG ﬁlm mag-
netized along the main axes in the z-direction by a harmonic magnetic ﬁeld
with frequency Ω and the angle amplitude β). Formally this process may be
described by the action of the unitary matrix ˆhos3 belonging to the isotropy
group of |R > [15]. Then the coherence vector will oscillate along the equator
of the Poincar´e sphere. The next step is the dragging of the oscillating state
|x′(t) >= ˆhos3|x > with frequency ω up to the “north pole” corresponding to
the state |R >. In fact this is the motion of the coherence vector. This may
be achieved by the variation of the azimuth of the linear polarized state from
2 = − π
θ
4 with help of the dense ﬂint of appropriate length embedded

4 up to θ

2 = π

into the sweeping magnetic ﬁeld. Further this beam should pass the λ/4 plate.
This process of variation of the ellipticity of the polarization ellipse may be
described by the unitary matrix ˆbos′
belonging to the coset homogeneous sub-
manifold U (2)/[U (1) × U (1)] = CP (1) of the dynamical group U (2) [22]. This
dragging without modulation leads to the evolution of the initial state along
the geodesic of CP (1) and the trace of the coherent vector is the meridian of
the Poincar´e sphere between the equator and one of the poles. The modulation
deforms both the geodesic and the corresponding trace of the coherence vector
on the Poincar´e sphere during such unitary evolution.

1

The action of the λ/4 plate depends upon the state of the incoming beam
(the relative orientation of the fast axes of the plate and the polarization of
the beam). Furthermore, only relative phases and amplitudes of photons in the
beam have a physical meaning for the λ/4 plate. Neither the absolute amplitude
(intensity of the beam), nor the general phase aﬀect the polarization character
of the outgoing state. It means that the device action depends only upon the
local coordinates π1 = Ψ1
Ψ0 ∈ CP (1). Small relative re-orientation of the λ/4
plate and the incoming beam leads to a small variation of the outgoing state.
This means that the λ/4 plate re-orientation generates the tangent vector to
CP (1). It is natural to discuss the two components of such a vector: velocities
of the variations of the ellipticity and of the azimuth (inclination) angle of
the polarization ellipse. They are examples of LDV. The comparison of such
dynamical variables for diﬀerent coherent states requires that aﬃne parallel
transport agrees with the Fubini-Study metric.

As far as I know the generalized problem of the quantum measurement of an
arbitrary hermitian dynamical variable ˆH = Eαˆλα,
ˆλα ∈ AlgSU (N ) in the
operational manner given above was newer done. It is solved here by the exact
analytical diagonalization of an hermitian matrix. Previously this problem was
solved partly in the works [23, 24, 25]. Geometrically it looks like embedding
“the ellipsoid of polarizations” into the iso-space of the adjoint representation
of SU (N ). This ellipsoid is associated with the quadric form < F | ˆH|F >=
Eα < F |ˆλα|F >= Hab(Eα)f a∗f b depending on N 2 − 1 real parameters
Eα. The shape of this ellipsoid with N main axes is giving by the 2(N − 1)

parameters of the coset transformations G/H = SU (N )/S[U (1) × U (N − 1)] =
CP (N − 1) relate to the (N − 1) complex local coordinates of the eigen-state of
ˆH in CP (N − 1). Its orientation in iso-space RN 2−1 is much more complicated
than it was in the case of R3. It is given by generators of the isotropy group
containing N − 1 = rank(AlgSU (N )) independent parameters of “rotations”
about commutative operators ˆλ3, ˆλ8, ˆλ15, ... and (N − 1)(N − 2) parameters of
rotations about non-commutative operators. All these (N − 1)2 = (N − 1) +
(N − 1)(N − 2) gauge angles of the isotropy group H = S[U (1) × U (N − 1)]
of the eigen-state giving orientation of this ellipsoid in iso-space RN 2−1 will be
calculated now during the process of analytical diagonalization of the hermitian
matrix Hab =< a| ˆH|b > corresponding to some dynamical variable ˆH.

where ˜H02 = H02 cos φ− H03 sin φe−iψ and ˜H03 = H02 sin φeiψ + H03 cos φ. Now
one has solve two “equations of annihilation” of ℜ(H02 sin(φ)eiψ +H03 cos(φ)) =
0 and ℑ(H02 sin(φ)eiψ + H03 cos(φ)) = 0 in order to eliminate the last element
of the ﬁrst row and its hermitian conjugate [20, 25]. This gives us φ′

of the transition from one pure state to another, in particular between two
eigen-states connected by the geodesic. This means that these transformations

deform the ellipsoid. All possible shapes of these ellipsoids are distributed along
a single geodesic.

Generally, in the dynamical situation this “stationary” global procedure is
not applicable and one should go to the local analog of ˆλ-matrices, i.e. SU (N )
generators and related dynamical variables should be parameterized by the local
quantum states coordinates (π1, ..., πN −1).

4 Local dynamical variables

The state space H with ﬁnite action quanta is a stationary construction. We
introduce dynamics by the velocities of the GCS variation representing some
“elementary excitations” (quantum particles). Their dynamics is speciﬁed by
the Hamiltonian, giving time variation velocities of the action quantum numbers
in diﬀerent directions of the tangent Hilbert space T(π1,...,πN −1)CP (N −1) which
takes the place of the ordinary linear quantum state space as will be explained
below. The rate of the action variation gives the energy of the “particles” whose
expression should be established by some wave equations.

The local dynamical variables correspond to the internal SU (N ) group of
the GCS and their breakdown should be expressed now in terms of the local
coordinates πk. The Fubini-Study metric

Gik∗ = [(1 +

in these coordinates will be used. Hence the internal dynamical variables and
their norms should be state-dependent, i.e. local in the state space [20]. These
local dynamical variables realize a non-linear representation of the unitary global
SU (N ) group in the Hilbert state space CN . Namely, N 2 − 1 generators of
G = SU (N ) may be divided in accordance with the Cartan decomposition:
[B, B] ∈ H, [B, H] ∈ B, [B, B] ∈ H. The (N − 1)2 generators

2(N − 1) generators

Φi
b

∂
∂πi + c.c. ∈ B,

(24)

are the coset G/H = SU (N )/S[U (1)× U (N − 1)] generators realizing the break-
down of the G = SU (N ) symmetry of the GCS. Furthermore, the (N − 1)2
generators of the Cartan sub-algebra may be divided into the two sets of op-
erators: 1 ≤ c ≤ N − 1 (N − 1 is the rank of AlgSU (N )) Abelian operators,

12

and 1 ≤ q ≤ (N − 1)(N − 2) non-Abelian operators corresponding to the non-
commutative part of the Cartan sub-algebra of the isotropy (gauge) group. Here
1 ≤ σ ≤ N 2 − 1 are the coeﬃcient functions of the generators of the non-
Φi
σ,
linear SU (N ) realization. They give the inﬁnitesimal shift of the i-component
of the coherent state driven by the σ-component of the unitary multipole ﬁeld
Ωα rotating the generators of AlgSU (N ) and they are deﬁned as follows:

i.e. CP (N − 1) is embedded in the Hilbert space H = CN . Hereafter I will

Now we see that all eigen-vectors corresponding to diﬀerent eigen-values
j(p), ..., πN −1
(even under the degeneration) are applied to diﬀerent points (π1
j(p) )
of the CP (N − 1). Nevertheless the eigen-vectors |Dp(π1
j(p) ) > are
mutually orthogonal in H = CN if ˆH is hermitian Hamiltonian. Therefore one
has the “splitting” or delocalization of degenerated eigen-states in CP (N − 1).
Thus the local coordinates πi gives the convenient parametrization of the SU (N )
action as one will see below.

We saw that SU (N ) geometry gives the shape and the orientation of the
ellipsoid associated with the “average” of dynamical variable given by a quadric
form < F | ˆD|F >.
If it is taking “as given” it show only primitive eigen-
value problem. But if one rises the question about real operational sense of the
quantum measurement of this dynamical variable or the process of the transition
from one eigen-state to another, one sees that quantum state and dynamical
variable involved in much more complicated relations that it is given in the

(36)

orthodox quantum scheme. The simple reason for this is that the decomposition
(representation) of the state vector of a quantum system strongly depends on the
spectrum and eigen-vectors of its dynamical variable. Overloaded system of the
GCS’s supplies us by enough big “reserve” of functions but their superposition
should be local and they span a tangent space at any speciﬁc point of CP (N −1)
marked by the local coordinates.

The “probability” may be introduced now by pure geometric way like cos2φ

in tangent state space as follows.

For any two tangent vectors Di

1 =< D1|Ti >, Di

2 =< D2|Ti > one can deﬁne

the scalar product

(D1, D2) = ℜGik∗ Di

1Dk

2 = cos φ1,2(D1, D1)1/2(D2, D2)1/2.

Then the value

j(p), ..., πN −1

j(p) ) = cos2 φ1,2 =

(D1, D2)2
(D1, D1)(D2, D2)

(39)

may be treated as a relative probability of the appearance of two states arising
during the measurements of two diﬀerent dynamical variables D1, D2 by the
variation of the initial GCS (π1
Some LDV ~Ψ = Ψi ∂

∂πi + c.c. may be associated with the “state vector”
|Ψ >∈ H which has tangent components Ψi =< Ti|Ψ > in TπCP (N − 1). Thus
the scalar product

j(p), ..., πN −1
j(p) ).

(Ψ, D) = ℜGik∗ ΨiDk

j(p) ) = cos2 φΨ,i =

(Ψ, Ψ)(Di, Di)

may be identiﬁed with “probabilities” in each tangent direction of TπCP (N −1).
The conservation law of “probability” is given by the simple identity

The notion of the “probability” is of course justiﬁed by our experience since
diﬀerent kinds of ﬂuctuations prevent the exact knowledge of any quantum
dynamical variable. That is not only because the uncertainty relation be-
tween two canonically conjugated dynamical variables puts the limit of accu-
racy, but because any real measurement of a single dynamical variable or the
process of preparation of some state are not absolutely exact.
It is easy to
see from the relation between the velocity V i = dπi
in CP (N − 1) and the

But it is not the reason to deny a possibility to know any dynamical variable

with an acceptable accuracy.

5 Objective Quantum Measurement

The CP (N − 1) manifold takes the place of the “classical phase space” since
its points, corresponding to the GCS, are most close to classical states of mo-
tion. Their points may be interpreted as the “Schr¨odinger’s lump” [27]. It is
important that in this case the “Schr¨odinger’s lump” has the exact mathemat-
ical description and clear physical interpretation: points of CP (N − 1) are the
axis of the ellipsoid of the action operator ˆS, i.e. extremals of the action func-
tional S[|F >]. Then the velocities of variation of these axis correspond to local
Hamiltonian or diﬀerent local dynamical variables.

j(p), ..., πN −1

Let me assume that GCS described by local coordinates (π1, ..., πN −1) cor-
responds to the original lump, and the coordinates (π1 + δπ1, ..., πN −1 + δπN −1)
correspond to the lump displaced due to measurement.
I will use a GCS
j(p) ) of some action operator ˆS = ¯hA( ˆη+ ˆη) representing physically
(π1
distinguishable states. This means that any two points of CP (N − 1) deﬁne
two ellipsoids diﬀer at least by the orientations, if not by the shape, as it was
discussed above. As such, they may be used as “yes/no” states of some two-level
detector.

Local coordinates of the lump gives the a ﬁrm geometric tool for the de-
scription of quantum dynamics during interaction which used for a measuring
process. The question that I would like to raise is as follows: what “classical
ﬁeld”, i.e. ﬁeld in space-time, corresponds to the transition from the original to
the displaced lump? In other words I would like to ﬁnd the measurable phys-
ical manifestation of the lump , which I called the “ﬁeld shell”, its space-time
shape and its dynamics. The lump’s dynamics will be represented by energy
(frequencies) distribution that are not a priori given, but are deﬁned by some
ﬁeld equations which should established by means of a new variation problem.
Before its formulation, we wish to introduce diﬀerential geometric construction.
I assume that there is expectation state |D >: ˆD|D >= λp|D >, associated
with “measuring device” tuned for measurement of dynamical variable ˆD at
some eigen-state (π1

j(p), ..., πN −1
j(p) )

|D >= |Dp(π1

Hereafter I will omit indexes j(p) for a simplicity. Now one should build the
spinor of the “logical spin 1/2” in the local basis (|N >, |
D >) for the quantum
question in respect with the measurement of the local dynamical variable ~D at
corresponding GCS which may be marked by the local normal state

(45)

Since in general |D > it is not a tangent vector to CP (N − 1), the deviation
from GCS during the measurement of ˆD will be represented by tangent vector

g
− < N orm|(|D > − < N orm|D > |N orm >)|N orm >

= |D > − < N orm|D > |N orm >= |

g
e

This projector ˆQ takes the place of dichotomic dynamical variable (quantum
question) for the discrimination of the normal state |N > (it represents the
eigen-state at GCS) the and the orthogonal tangent state |
D > that represents
the velocity of deviation form GCS. The coherent superposition of two eigen-
vectors of ˆQ at the point (π1, ..., πN −1) forms the spinor η with the components

Then accelerations a1, a2, a3 and angle velocities ω1, ω2, ω3 may be found in the
linear approximation from the equation

η + δη = Lη

(54)

as functions of the “logical spin 1/2” spinor components depending on local
coordinates (π1, ..., πN −1).

Hence the inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformations deﬁne small “space-time”
coordinates variations. It is convenient to take Lorentz transformations in the
~x′ = ~x + ct~adτ + (~ω × ~x)dτ , where I put
following form ct′ = ct + (~x~a)dτ,
~a = (a1/c, a2/c, a3/c),
~ω = (ω1, ω2, ω3) [28] in order to have for τ the physical
dimension of time. The expression for the “4-velocity” vµ is as follows

vµ =

δxµ
δτ

= (~x~a, ct~a + ~ω × ~x).

(55)

The coordinates xµ of points in dynamical space-time serve in fact merely for
the parametrization of deformations of the “ﬁeld shell” arising under its motion
according to non-linear ﬁeld equations [13, 14].

6 Field equations in the dynamical space-time

in the dynamical space-time intrinsically connected with the objective quantum
measurement of the “elementary lump” associated with a quantum particle. At
each point (π1, ..., πN −1) of the CP (N −1) one has an “expectation value” of the
~H deﬁned by a measuring device. But a displaced GCS may by reached along
one of the continuum paths. Therefore the comparison of two vector ﬁelds and
their “expectation values” at neighboring points requires some natural rule. The
comparison for the same “particle” may be realized by “ﬁeld shell” dynamics
along some path in CP (N −1). For this reason one should have an identiﬁcation
procedure. The aﬃne parallel transport in CP (N −1) of vector ﬁelds is a natural
and the simplest rule for the comparison of corresponding “ﬁeld shells”.

The dynamical space-time coordinates xµ may be introduced as the state-
dependent quantities, transforming in accordance with the local Lorentz trans-
ν δτ )xν depend on the transformations of local

of the Hamiltonian ﬁeld. I will discuss the simplest case of CP (1) dynamics
when 1 ≤ α, β ≤ 3,
i, k, n = 1. This system in the case of the spherical
symmetry being split into the real and imaginary parts takes the form

(57)

(58)

(r/c)ωt + ctωr = −2ωγF (u, v),
(r/c)γt + ctγr = (ω2 − γ2)F (u, v),
ut = βU (u, v, ω, γ),
vt = βV (u, v, ω, γ),

It is impossible of course to solve this self-consistent problem analytically
even in this simplest case of the two state system, but it is reasonable to develop
a numerical approximation in the vicinity of the following exact solution. Let
γ = ρ sin ψ, then, assuming for simplicity that ω2 + γ2 =
me put ω = ρ cos ψ,
ρ2 = constant, the two ﬁrst PDE’s may be rewritten as follows:

r
c

ψt + ctψr = F (u, v)ρ cos ψ.

(59)

The one of the exact solutions of this quasi-linear PDE is

ψexact(t, r) = arctan

exp(2cρF (u, v)f (r2 − c2t2))(ct + r)2F (u,v) − 1
exp(2cρF (u, v)f (r2 − c2t2))(ct + r)2F (u,v) + 1

,

(60)

where f (r2 − c2t2) is an arbitrary function of the interval.

Figure 1: Two solutions of (60) in the light-cone vicinity

In order to keep physical interpretation of these equations I will ﬁnd the
stationary solution for (58). Let me put ξ = r − ct. Then one will get ordinary
diﬀerential equation

Two solutions

Ψ(ξ) = arctan(

),

where M = F (u, v)ρ are concentrated in the vicinity of the light-cone looks like
solitary waves, see Fig.1.

Hence one may treat they as some “potentials” for the local coordinates of
GCS (u = ℜπ1, v = ℑπ1). The character of these solutions should be discussed
elsewhere.

Conclusion
1. The generalized (in comparison with “2-level” case [22]) the intrinsically
geometric scheme of the quantum measurement of an arbitrary Hermitian “N-
level” dynamical variable has been proposed. The interaction arose due to the
breakdown of G = SU (N ) symmetry is used for such measurement and it is
represented by the aﬃne gauge “ﬁeld shell” propagated in the dynamical state-
dependent space-time.

2. The concept of “super-relativity” [20] is in fact a diﬀerent kind of attempts
of “hybridization” of internal and space-time symmetries. In distinguish from
SUSY where a priori exists the extended space-time - “super-space”, in my ap-
proach the dynamical space-time arises under “yes/no” quantum measurement
of SU (N ) local dynamical variables.

3. The pure local formulation of quantum theory in CP (N − 1) leads seem-
ingly to the decoherence [22]. We may, of course, to make mentally the concate-
nation of any two quantum systems living in direct product of their state spaces.
The variation of the one of them during a measurement may lead formally to
some variations in the second one. Unavoidable ﬂuctuations in our devices
may even conﬁrm predictable correlations. But the introduction of the state-
dependent dynamical space-time evokes a necessity to reformulate the Bell’s
inequalities which may lead then to a diﬀerent condition for the coincidences.

4. The locality in the quantum phase space CP (N − 1) leads to extended
quantum particles - “ﬁeld shell” that obey the quasi-linear PDE [13, 14]. The
physical status of their solutions is the open question. But if they somehow really
connected with “elementary particles”, say, electrons, then the plane waves of de
Broglie should not be literally refer to the state vector of the electron itself but
rather to covector (1-form) realized, say, by electrons in a periodic cristall lattice.
The fact that the condition for diﬀraction is in nice agreement with experiments
may be explained that for this agreement it is important only relative velocity
of electron and the lattice.

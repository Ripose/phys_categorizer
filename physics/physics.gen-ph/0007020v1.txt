Black Holes From Diiﬀerent Perspectives

Centre for Applicable Mathematics & Computer Sciences

In this paper we consider black holes from a non general relativistic

perspective as also from a microphysical point of view.

Abstract

1 Introduction

It is generally believed that the concept of Black Holes requires General
Relativity for its understanding and interpretation. In this brief note we will
show that Black Holes could also be understood without invoking General
Relativity at all.
We start by deﬁning a Black Hole as an object at the surface of which, the
escape velocity equals the maximum possible velocity in the universe viz., the
velocity of light. We next use the well known equation of Keplerian orbits[1],

r

=

GM
L2 (1 + ecosθ)

(1)

where L, the so called impact parameter is given by, Rc, where R is the point
of closest approach, in our case a point on the surface of the object and c is
the velocity of approach, in our case the velocity of light.
Choosing θ = 0 and e ≈ 1, we can deduce from (1)

R =

2GM

c2

(2)

Equation (2) gives the Schwarzchild radius for a Black Hole and can be
deduced from the full General Relativistic theeory[2].
We will now use (2) to exhibit Black Holes at three diﬀerent scales, the micro,
the macro and the cosmic scales.

2 Black Holes

Our starting point is the observation that a Planck mass, 10−5gms at the
Planck length, 10−33cms satisﬁes (2) and, as such is a Schwarzchild Black
Hole (Cf.ref.[3]). Infact Rosen has used non-relativistic Quantum Theory to
show that such a particle is a mini universe[4].
We next come to stellar scales. It is well known that for an electron gas in a
highly dense mass we have[5]

M is the mass, R the radius of the body, mP and me are the proton and
electron masses and ¯h is the reduced Planck Constant. From (3) and (4) it
is easy to see that for ¯M < 1060, there are highly condensed planet sized
stars. (Infact these considerations lead to the Chandrasekhar limit in stellar
theory). We can also verify that for ¯M approaching 1060 corresponding to a
mass ∼ 1036gms, or roughly a hundred to a thousand times the solar mass,
the radius R gets smaller and smaller and would be ∼ 108cms, so as to satisfy
(2) and give a Black Hole in broad agreement with theory.
Finally for the universe as a whole, using only the theory of Newtonian
gravitation, it is well known that we can deduce

R ∼

GM
c2

(5)

where this time R ∼ 1028cms is the radius of the universe and M ∼ 1055gms
is the mass of the universe.
Equation (5) suggests that the universe itself is a Black Hole. It is remarkable
that if we consider the universe to be a Schwarzchild Black Hole as suggested
by (5), the time taken by a ray of light to traverse the universe equals the
age of the universe ∼ 1017secs as shown elsewhere [6].

3 The Kerr-Newman Formulation for the Elec-

tron

It was already noted[7], that a particle with the Planck mass viz. 10−5gms
could be considered to be a Schwarzchild black hole whose radius is of the
order of the Planck length viz., 10−33cms. One could then ask whether a
charged rotating black hole, that is a Kerr-Newman black hole could represent
an elementary particle with charge. Indeed the remarkable fact has been well
known[2] that the purely classical Kerr-Newman metric does describe the
electron, including its purely Quantum Mechanical anomalous gyro magnetic
ratio g = 2! This could have been construed to be the much sought after
uniﬁcation of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, except for the fact
that such a Kerr-Newman electron black hole would have a naked singularity.
That is, its radius becomes complex:

r+ =

GM
c2 + ıb, b ≡ (

G2Q2
c8 + a2 −

G2M 2

c4

)1/2

(6)

where G is the gravitational constant M the mass and a ≡ L/Mc, L being
the angular momentum.
Even in the derivation of the above Kerr-Newman metric, Newman has
noted[8] the puzzling fact that an imaginary shift of coordinates has to be
invoked and that it is this imaginary shift which gives the rotation or spin.
From a classical point of view this is inexplicable.
On the other hand it has been pointed out by the author[9] that the Quantum
Mechanical coordinate of a Dirac electron is given by

x = (c2p1H −1t + a1) +

ı
2

c¯h(α1 − cp1H −1)H −1,

(7)

where a1 is an arbitrary constant and cα1 is the velocity operator with eigen
values ±c.
It has also been noted that for the electron the imaginary parts in (6) and
(7) are of the same order, and that this imaginary coordinate was given a
physical explanation long ago by Dirac[10]: This has to do with the famous
Zitterbewegung. As space time intervals shrink, by Heisenberg’s Uncertainty
Principle the uncertainty in the momentum - energy values increases. Thus
only averages over space time intervals, speciﬁcally at the Compton scale, are

3

physically meaningful. Within the Compton scale we encounter unphysical
Zitterbewegung eﬀects which show up as complex (or non-Hermitian) coor-
dinates (Cf.also ref.[11]).
So the unsatisfactory feature of the Kerr-Newman electron black hole can
be circumvented with the Quantum Mechanical input that rather than space
time points as in classical theory, we need to consider averages over Compton
scale space time intervals.
All this pleasingly dovetails with the fact that minumum space time cut oﬀs
can be taken consistently with the Lorentz transformation as shown by Sny-
der a long time ago[12]. In recent years there has ben a return to ideas of
discrtee space time including through string theory[13]. Further if the cut oﬀ
is at the Compton scale (l, τ ) then we have a non commutative geometry[13]
viz.,

[x, y] = 0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h(1 − l2)

(8)

and similar equations, which can be shown to directly lead to the Dirac equa-
tion. In other words it is this minimum Compton scale space time cut oﬀ as
in equation (8) which leads to the Dirac matrices, spin and the anomalous
gyro magnetic ratio g = 2. Indeed it has been noted recently by Ne’eman[14]
that such a non commutative geometry provides a rationale for renormaliza-
tion. Infact this was the motivation for the very early work of Snyder and
others in introducing discrete space time.
It must be mentioned that if in (8) terms ∼ l2 are neglected, then we recover
the usual commutation relations of Quantum theory.

4 Some Experimental Consequences

The question that arises is, are there any experimental consequences of the
above formulation[15]:
I. We ﬁrst observe that the magnetic component of the ﬁeld of a static elec-
tron as a Kerr-Newman black hole is given in the familiar spherical polar
coordinates by (Cf.refs.[9, 11]).

Bˆr =

2ea
r3 cosΘ + 0(

1
r4 ), B ˆΘ =

easinΘ

r3 + 0(

1
r4 ), B ˆφ = 0,

(9)

4

whereas the electrical part is given by

Eˆr =

e
r2 + 0(

1
r3 ), E ˆΘ = 0(

1
r4 ), E ˆφ = 0,

(10)

A comparison of (9) and (10) shows that there is a magnetic component of
shorter range apart from the dipole which is given by the ﬁrst term on the
right in equation (9). We would like to point out that a short range force,
the B(3) force, mediated by massive photons has indeed been observed at
Cornell and studied over the past few years[16].
On the other hand as the Kerr-Newman charged black hole can be approx-
imated by a solenoid, we have as in the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect, a negligible
magnetic ﬁeld outdside, but at the same time a real vector potential ~A which
would contribute to a shift in phase. Infact this shift in phase is given by
(Cf. also ref.[17])

∆δ ˆB =

e

¯h I ~A. ~ds

(11)

(12)

There is also a similar eﬀect due to the electric charge given by

∆δ ˆE = −

e

¯h Z A0dt

where A0 is the usual electro static potential given in (10). In the above Kerr-
Newman formulation, ( ~A, A0) of (11) and (12) are given by (Cf.refs.[9, 11])

Aσ =

1
2

(ηµvhµv), σ,

From (13) it can be seen that

~A ∼

1
c

A0

(13)

(14)

Substitution of (14) in (11) then gives us the contribution of the shift in
phase due to the magnetic ﬁeld.
II. Let us now consider some imprints of discrete space time, as discussed in
section 1.
First we consider the case of the neutral pion. As is known, this pion decays
into an electron and a positron. Could we think of it as an electron-positron
bound state also[11, 18, 19, 20]? In this case we have,

mv2

r

=

e2
r2

5

(15)

Consistently with the above formulation, if we take v = c from (15) we get
the correct Compton wavelength lπ = r of the pion.
However this appears to go against the fact that there would be pair anni-
hilation with the release of two photons. Nevertheless if we consider discrete
space time, the situation would be diﬀerent.
In this case the Schrodinger
equation

Hψ = Eψ

(16)

where H contains the above Coulumb interaction could be written, in terms
of the space and time separated wave function components as (Cf. also
ref.[21]),

Hψ = EφT = φı¯h[

T (t − τ ) − T

τ

]

(17)

where τ is the minimum time cut oﬀ which in the above work has been taken
to be the Compton time. If, as usual we let T = exp(irt) we get

(18) shows that if,

E = −

2¯h
τ

sin

τ r
2

|E| <

2¯h
τ

(18)

(19)

holds then there are stable bound states. Indeed inequality (19) holds good
when τ is the Compton time and E is the total energy mc2. Even if inequality
(19) is reversed, there are decaying states which are relatively stable around
the cut oﬀ energy 2¯h
τ .
This is the explanation for treating the pion as a bound state of an electron
and a positron, as indeed is borne out by its decay mode. The situation is
similar to the case of Bohr orbits– there also the electrons would according
to classical ideas have collapsed into the nucleus and the atoms would have
disappeared. In this case it is the discrete nature of space time which enables
the pion to be a bound state as described by (15).
Another imprint of discrete space time can be found in the Kaon decay puzzle,
as pointed out by the author[22]. There also we have equations like (16) and
(17) above, with the energy term being given by E(1 + i), due to the fact
that space time is quantized. Not only is the fact that the imaginary and real
parts of the energy are of the same order borne out but as pointed out in[22]
this also explains the recently observed [23] Kaon decay and violation of the

6

time reversal symmetry.
In the words of Penrose[24], ”the tiny fact of an
almost completely hidden time-asymmetry seems genuinely to be present in
the K 0-decay. It is hard to believe that nature is not, so to speak, trying to
tell something through the results of this delicate and beautiful experiment.”
From an intuitive point of view, the above should not be surprising because
time or even space reversal symmetry is based on a space time continuum
and is no longer obvious if space time were discrete.
Indeed this can be seen from equation (8): If we retain terms ∼ l2 then
there is no invariance under not just time but also space reﬂections. It is
within this framework that we can also explain the handedness of the nearly
massless neutrino: It has a comparatively large Compton wavelength l and
by (8) space reﬂection symmetry no longer holds.

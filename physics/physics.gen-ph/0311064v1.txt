nuclei

It is shown here that loosely bound halo structure of neutron rich nuclei
and the ground state spin of single neutron halo nuclei are correlated and
are consistently explained if one assumes a double potential shell model for
these nuclei.

Abstract

1

Halo nuclei oﬀer unique challenges in nuclear physics.

It seems that
around a core of a few nucleons, there sit one or two nucleons very far away
from the centre of the whole nucleus but still bound to it. As such their radii
are much larger than what should be as per our understanding in standard
nuclear physics [1]. Another feature is that for all the single neutron halo
nuclei discovered so far the ground state spin has always been 1
. At present
2
this is being interprested as shifting and mixing of single particle levels in
the shell model [1,2]. Here we make a novel suggestion of a double potential
shell model which accounts for both the loose halo structure and its ground
state spin. Hence it is shown that the two are correlated in a basic way in
this new model.

As of now a few two neutron halo nuclei and a few single neutron halo
nuclei have been discoverd. Howeevr what is puzzling is the experimenatl
fact that for all the single neutron halo nuclei [1-3] ( which are 11
6 C9
and 19
. At present this is
being viewed as shifting and mixing of diﬀerent levels in these diverse nuclei
in ways which may justﬁably be called ” mysterious and arbitaray ”. The
author feels that for such unique and global features as very loose structure
of the valence neutron and the unique ground state spin of 1
in all the cases

known there has to be some common conncetion which should be basic and
”simple”.

What is it that these empirical features are hinting at. Let us use the fact
that the core is almost decoupled from the valence neutrons. In simple shell
model we know the the central potential follows rather closely the nuclear
density distribution [4].

Let us put the empirical fact that the total density in a halo nucleus may

be written as made up of a core and a halo part

And thus the total potential separates out as

Hence the author here makes a suggestion that these features are hinting
at the existence of double potential for these nuclei. A schematic plot of
such a double potential well is given in Figure 1. Let us take 11
4 Be7 as an
example. Here as per empirical information 10
4 Be6 forms a core and a single
neutron orbiting it in a loose halo around this core. We assume tha the core
10
4 Be6 is built as per standard shell structure in the inner potential in Fig
1. The second potential structure assumes that it exists becaues there exists
a primary inner potential. Now the last valence neutron ﬁlls the orbits in
the second potentail starting with the s-state. Hence its spin is 1
which
2
also is the spin of the whole nucleus 11
4 Be7. This is the situation in all the
single neutron halo nuclei. The core is built upon the inner potential as
per standard nuclear shell model and the last valence neutron sits in the
lowest orbital to give total ground state spin to the nucleus.
If there are
two neutrons in the halo then its apin contribution would be zero. Quite
clearly in this picture if one were to add any more protons to halo nucleus
it will go to the inner shell for these neutron rich nuclei. Quite clearly this
double potential is for valence neutrons only. So for 11
3 Li8 as the 2- valence
neutrons which form the halo would sit in the second potentail s-state and
thus contribute spin zero. Thus the total spin of the nucleus would come
from the protons as per these ﬁlling up the ﬁrst potetial shell.

This picture predicts that as the lowest orbital in the second potential
can absorb only upto two neutrons so halos should most likely be observed
for upto two neutrons. In all conﬁrmed cases this is what the situation is,
If one wants to add more neutron one has to send it to the higher p- state.
This would still be permitted but would require higher excitation energy. So
higher number of neutrons in the halo is not ruled out as per this model.
However cases with more than 2-neutrons in the halos will be suppressed.

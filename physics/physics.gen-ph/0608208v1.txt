PHYSICAL REALITIES FROM SIMPLE
PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURES.

HELEN LYNN AND MICHELE CAPONIGRO

Abstract. We will focus on the Quantum theory and starting from simple
philosophical conjectures, we infer possible diﬀerent physical realities. Also we
argue of possible wavefunction emerging under speciﬁc conditions of the phys-
ical reality. Finally, we aﬃrm that the ”hidden choice” of the ontic elements
as primitive is a fundamental step to analyze the construction of any theory.

1. Three basic elements.

We work with three basic elements:

(1) The observer.
(2) The law of physics.
(3) Physical Phenomenon.

We assume that physical reality and physical phenomenon are diﬀerent concepts,
latter is subjects of observation. Above three elements and quantum theory will be
used to infer possible underlying physical realities.

Premise:

• symbol: 1 mean an ontic element
• symbol: 0 mean an epistemic element
• the choice of symbol ”1” mean that the correspondent element is take as

primitive.

This classical table summarize possible realities:

Observation: The hidden choice of the primitive element is fundamental to
determine the underlying reality. Now,the problem is to establish if: (i)the ”choice”
is a consequence of theory,a consequence of his experimental data or (ii) an ”a

priori” hidden choice. We argue, that we can ﬁnd in the premise of any theory
the questions/answers and their consequence, in other words, we have the start/end
in the premise. In order to justify these strong and debated statements, we can
see (above table), that starting from diﬀerent ontic elements, related to the same
phenomenon ( e.g. measurement process in quantum theory) we have two diﬀerent
interpretations of underlying physical reality.

For instance, the ﬁrst case:

(1) The observer is the ontic element
(2) The law of physics are secondary
(3) Physical Phenomenon is secondary

The consequences of the measurement process are:

(1) ”Measurement” is only an information of the observer.
(2) The physical reality do not exist.
(3) Physical Phenomenon is provoked by observer.

For instance, a second case:

(1) Physical Phenomenon is ontic.
(2) The observer is a secondary property.
(3) The law of physics are secondary.

The consequences related to measurement process are:

(1) Physical Phenomenon is the only objective elements.
(2) The observer is a reduction of the phenomenon, they have the same prop-

(3) Instrumentalist interpretation of the physical’s laws.

As we can see, the conclusions on the conception of reality are completely dif-

erties.

ferent.

2. Wavefunction inferred.

We conclude the brief paper, with another table, now we include in the table
as variable ontic/epistemic the physical reality in order to infer the correspondent
quantum mechanics theory (i.e. wavefunction). In this case we try to give an ”a
priori” possible nature of physical reality.

PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURES.

Simple and intuitive conjectures from philosophical point of view, maybe help us
to clear the ”entangled” world of the interpretations of QM. The ”a priori” choice
of the ontic elements remain a fundamental step to interpret and analyze not only
quantum theory.

3. Conclusion.

Abstract

Evidence implies that basic laws of thermodynamics must be tested by experiments. In
this paper, an experiment is designed to measure the entropy of a system with at least one
known (measurable) equation of state, especially the gas systems. Since the entropy can be
measured now, the formulae related to the second law of thermodynamics can be examined
by other experiments.

1 Introduction

Among the branches of classical physics, thermodynamics and statistical physics should be the
most fantastic ones, which have attracted so many great minds to devote their lives and energy
to investigating every topic in these ﬁelds. Perhaps among the branches of classical physics, they
are the only ones that leave so many open questions, not only in the ﬁeld of application, but also
in their foundations.

In the last century, most of the physcists are attracted to the quantized physics, which can
be viewed as the opposite side of classical physics. Although quantization has been the principal
melody of physics ever since then, thermodynamics and statistical physics are still vivid with
their own open questions. And, even in the so-called modern physics, shadows of thermodynamics
and statistical physics are also seen: In the black hole theory, black holes are endowed with the
temperature and the entropy[1]. Ideas and concepts of thermodynamics and statistical physics
are also applied to the condensed matter theory and the string theory[2]. In fact, the history of
quantum theory can be traced back to thermodynamics and statistical physics, where M. Planck
use the famous assumption E = hν to derive the spectral energy distribution of black bodies,
Planck’s formula[3]. What’s more, thermodynamics and statistical physics even paved their way
to theories other than physics, such as Shannon’s theory in information theory. Maybe one day
someone cheers that they can be used in economics.

On the one hand, thermodynamics and statistical physics are so widely applied. On the
other hand, there are so many open questions in them — there are enven no universal theories,

neither thermodynamic nor statistical, for non-equilibrium systems. Thus the foundations of
thermodynamics, which have been established for more than one hundred years and which are
claimed to be valid for arbitrary thermal systems and arbitrary processes, could not be tested by
comparing the experimental data with the predictions from a universal thermodynamics. This
sounds not so nice to the society of physics.

There are other reasons forcing us to seek for the experimental supports of the basic laws of
thermodynamics. They mainly focus on the easily-misunderstood concept, heat, in theromdy-
namics, which has been widely discussed and quarreled about in literature.

One of such a reason concerns the nature of heat: Is heat a kind of substance accompanying
ordinary matter, as it was said in the old-fashioned caloric theory, or just the energy transferred
from one body to another as the result of the diﬀerence of temperature? As we know, thermody-
namics has chosen the latter. But the following consideration will make thermodynamics to sink
into trouble.

Recall that the Gibbs free energy G = µn for an equilibrium system of pure substance, where
µ is the chemical potential of the substance and n is its amount meassured in moles. Hence the
internal energy U of such a system reads

U = −pV + T S + µn,

(1)

or something like that. Now let us consider a subsystem of it which has a virtual boundary that
seperates the subsystem from the whole. Now suppose that the virtual boundary of the subsystem
expands slowly such that the center of mass remains unchanged and the process can be considered
as quasi-static. Since the virtual boundadry and the process are just imaginary, the intensive
quantities p, T and µ are constant while the variations of extensive quantities V , S and n are
proportional, that is,

∆V
V0

=

∆S
S0

=

∆n
n0

,

where V0, S0 and n0 are the original volume, entropy and amount of the subsystem, respectively.
Hence, according to the formulism of thermodynamics, certain amount of heat Q = T ∆S 6= 0
must be absorbed by the subsystem after its virtual expansion. In other words, as a virtual surface
moves in an equilibrium system, one has to admit that an additional amount of heat, ¯dQ = T dS
has been transferred through it, accompanying the substance that goes through the surface, even
though the system is in equilibrium. In this sense, the caloric theory is somehow restored. On the
other hand, however, the zeroth law of thermodynamics should have repelled such a possibility,
because heat will not be transferred between two systems or two parts of a system provided there
is no diﬀerence of temperature.

The other reason that we must carefully examine the foundations of thermodynamics comes
from the observation of a transformation in the framework of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics[4].
Brieﬂy speaking, on the one hand, in order to measure the heat or certain heat-related quantities
such as the heat capacity accurately, one must know the internal energy of at least one substance,
the water, for example; On the other hand, according to the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, the
knowledge of the internal energy of water, say, comes from the measurement of heat in various
processes of the water. Obviously, such a chick-and-egg problem can not be solved within the
framework of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. Hence, from the point of view of the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics, it is not detectable if the following transformation,

U −→ U ′ = U + φ,

¯dQ −→ ¯dQ′ = ¯dQ + dφ,

(2)

is applied to every thermal system, in which φ is an arbitrary function of thermal variables.
However, with the second and the third laws of thermodynamics being considered, the above

2

transformation will be ﬁxed. In other words, in the point of view of the above transformation, a
properly chosen internal energy can be assigned to each thermal system such that both the second
law and the third law can be satisﬁed. So one must believe that there are some other methods to
measure the heat in an arbitrary quasi-static process, provided that the second law and the third
law of thermodynamcs hold for every process.

In this paper, such an experiment is proposed. If the theory of thermodynamics is correct, the
entropy of an equilibrium system can be measured. As we have mensioned in the above, however,
the motivation of this paper is not to merely give a mothod of how to measuring the entropy,
hence the heat in a quasi-static process. The original idea is to test the validity of the whole
theory of thermodynamcs, according to which the experimental data possess the features that is
described in §4. If otherwise, questions of thermodynamics will arise.

This paper is organized as in the following. In §2, we ﬁrst labels our ideas of how this ex-
periment is designed. Then follows the outline of the experiment. Based on the same apparatus,
there are two kinds of methods of how to measure the entropy of an equilibrium system. In §3,
the formulae are derived in deatails. In §4, conclusions and further discussions are given.

2 The Ideas and the Ouline of the Measuring Methods

The ideas of the experiment are described as in the following.

Since, as we have discussed, it remains to be a problem as how to measure the heat, in order
to verify the second law, or strictly speaking, the whole set of laws, of thermodynamics, we must
design an experiment which avoids measuring quantities related to heat. Hence the heat capacities
of various substances will neither be used as the experimental data nor be measured. Instead,
only quantities such as the volumes, the pressures, the amounts of concerned substances as well
as the temperatures must be measured. This is the basic point of the proposal experiment.

In deriving the formulae, the formulism of thermodynamics is applied. The partial derivatives
of the entropy or those of the chemical potentials are replaced of, with the Maxwell’s relations
being used whenever possible, because the entropy and the chemical potential cannot be measured
directly so far. According to the theory of thermodynamics, all the experimental data should be
located on a single line. If one ﬁnds this is not the case even after the errors are considered, there
must be some questions in the theory of thermodynamics.

In measuring the temperatures, the Kelvin temperature scale is needed in principle. However,

in practice this is not so easy to do. This problem is disposed of in the discussion section, §4.

The whole system is assumed to be thermally isolated from its surroundings. This is where
most of the errors come from in the measurement. The basic belief must be accepted in the
experiment: Systems will not transfer heat if they have the same temperature. We can demand
the environment of the system to keep the same temperature as that of the gas in the vessel B (see
Figure 1) so that the exchanging heat between the vessel B and the environment can be ignored.
Because the method of thermal isolation is a basic skill for measurements in thermodynamics, we
believe that this will not be a serious problem.

The experiment is outlined as in the following.
In the experiment, two kinds of gases, denoted respectively by 1 and 2, are put into the vessels
A and B, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. The vessel A is totally surrounded by the vessel B so
that heat transferred out of the vessel A will be absorbed totally by the gas in the vessel B. The
vessel B is thermally isolated from the environment. Techonologically, one may suppose that the
environment changes its temperature to keep up with the temperature of the gas in B so that it
can be viewed as an adiabatic wall of the the vessel B, because there will be no heat exchanging
between the invironment and the vessel B. The pistons, PA in the vessel A and PB in the vessel B,
can move in and out to change the volumes of the gases. In addition, there is a valve with a pipe

3

inserted into the vessel A, through which small amount of the gas in the vessel A can be bumped
in or out of it.

Figure 1: Measuring the entropy of gas systems.

The entropies of two diﬀerent kinds of gases can be measured at the same time. Let us call
the gases 1 and 2, respectively. Suppose that the i-th gas is in equilibrium with the volume Vi,
the pressure pi, the amount ni in the unit of moles and the chemical potential µi, where i = 1 and
2. Separated by the biathermal walls of the vessel A, they share the same temperature T , which
is currently measured in the Kelvin temperature scale.

In the ﬁrst step, gas 1 and gas 2 are put into the vessel A and B, respectively. the pistons PA
and PB are adjusted so that the volumes of gas 1 and gas 2 are respectively V1 and V2. Then, with
the pistons ﬁxed, we can always make the gases become thermally equilibrium with each other
at the temperature T . After that, we make the whole system to be thermally isolated from its
surroundings.

Now, a small amount dn1 of gas 1 is bumped into the vessel A through the pipe, with the
piston PA moved slightly meanwhile, making the whole system out of equilibrium. When the
thermal equilibrium is established again, we can measure again the common temperature, T + dT ,
of the gases. Now the volume of gas 1 is V1 + dV1, and the amount of gas 1 is n1 + dn1.

Then, in the second step, let gas 1 and gas 2 exchange their places, namely, put gas1 and gas
2 into the vessel B and A, respectively. The pistons are adjusted so that the volumes of gas 1 and
gas 2 are still V1 and V2, respectively. Similarly, ﬁxing the pistons, we make the gases absorb or
emit certain amount of heat to be in thermal equilibrium with each other at the temperature T as
in the ﬁrst step. After that, the whole system is again thermally isolated from its surroundings.
Now, certain amount of gas 2 is bumped into or out of the vessel A. Meanwhile the piston PA
is adjusted so that the gases are ﬁnally in thermal equilibrium with each other at the temperature
T + dT . The volume of gas 2 is V2 + dV2, and the amount of gas 2 is n2 + dn2.

In the above steps, a set of data are measured: dV1/dT and dn1/dT in the ﬁrst step, and

dV2/dT and dn2/dT in the second step. Then the following equation

should be satisﬁed, where S1 = S1(T, V1, n1) and S2 = S2(T, V2, n2) are the entropies of gas 1 and
gas 2, respectively, and p1 = p1(T, V1, n1) and p2 = p2(T, V2, n2) are respectively the pressures of

gas 1 and gas 2, while ∆C is a constant with the dimension of heat capacity, so small than that
of the vessels that it can be ignored, in fact. In the above equation, the partial derivatives of the
pressures with respect to the temperature must be measured in other processes.
With several sets of such data, we can ﬁx the entropies of gas 1 and gas 2.
There is another method to measure the entropy of any one of the gases, S1, say. Let us put
gas 1 into the vessel A and make it to keep equilibrium with the whole system. Suppose the
volume, the amount and the temperature of gas 1 are V1, n1 and T , respectively. Again the whole
system is thermally isolated from its surroundings. Then we bump some small amount dn1 of gas
1 into the vessel A. At the same time, the piston A is adjusted so that the temperature of gas 1
is kept constant throughout the process. If the volume of gas 1 is now V1 + dV1, then the entropy
S1 of gas 1 at the state (T, V1, n1) will be

3 The Principles of the Experiment

As we know, for a gas system, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics can be written in the form of

A Legendre transformation gives the diﬀerential of the free energy as

dU = −p dV + T dS + µ dn.

dF = −p dV − S dT + µ dn,

where the free energy is deﬁned as F = U − T S. Being a homogeneous function of V and n of
order 1 for any given temperature T , the Euler equation for homogeneous functions of order 1
must be satisﬁed, in which the temperature is treated as a parameter, giving

F = −pV + µn.

The option form of the above equation can be U = −pV + T S + µn for the internal energy, or[6]
G = µn for the Gibbs free energy.

One of the most important consequences of the above equations is that the intensive quantities
p, T and µ are not functionally independent, namely, their diﬀerentials are constrained by an
equation

Hence the partial derivative of the chemical potential µ with respective to the Kelvin temperature
T reads

Now let us focus our attention on the experiment. For the details of experiment, we refer the

readers to §2.

In the ﬁrst step, gas 1 in A with the pressure p1 and volume V1 is in thermal equilibrium with
gas 2 in B with the pressure p2 and volume V2. The common temperature of them is T . When
the volume and the amount of gas 1 are slowly changed, the heat absorbed by gas 1 is, according
to eq.(9),

V,n = C 1

where C 1
V,n(T, V1, n1) is the heat capacity of gas 1 at constant volume V1 and constant
amount n1. In this process, since the volume and the amount of gas 2 is remained to be constant,
it absorbs some heat

V,n = C 2

where C 2
V,n(T, V2, n2) is the heat capacity of gas 2 at constant volume V2 and constant
amount n2. Since the whole system is thermally isolated from its surroundings, if the heat absorbed
by the vessels and the pistons is assumed to be

¯dQ2 = C 2

V,n dT,

¯dQ3 = C dT

where C is the eﬀective heat capacity of the vessels and the pistons, there must be the equation

¯dQ1 + ¯dQ2 + ¯dQ3 = 0,

(11)

namely, the heat emitted by gas 1 will be absorbed by gas 2, the vessels and the pistons, or vice
versa. Hence we obtain

From the above equation, we can see that the whole system, when thermally isolated from its
surroundings, has two degrees of freedom. The corresponding variables may be the volume as well
as the amount of gas 1 in vessel A. Especially, the temperature of the system can be determined
by the above two variables. Thus, for a given state (T, V1, n1) of gas 1, one may adjust the volume
and the amount of it so that the temperature keeps invariant. In such a case, the ratio of the
changes of the volume and the amount, dV1
dn1 , will be constrained. On the other hand, if this ratio
has been measured, the entropy S1 of gas 1 can be determined as that in eq.(4).

Recall that gas 2, the pistons and the vessells won’t absorb any heat provided the temperature
remains constant, and that the whole system is thermally isolated. So the above process is not
only isothermal, but also adiabatic. On the other hand, according to eq.(9), for an open system,
if the process is both isothermal and adiabatic, the entropy of this system can be determined by
the equation having the same form as that in the above, only with the subscripts being omitted.
However, as discussed in the introduction, it seems that there are some questions in the concept
of heat for an open system. This is not the topic of this paper. We will discuss it in other papers.

6

Technologically, it is very hard to adjust the volume and the amount of gas 1 so that the
temperature keeps constant. Ordinarily, the temperature changes in the process, which can be
referred to as a parameter of the process, yielding the equation

Noticing that the heat capacities of gas 1 and gas 2 is totally symmetric in the above equation,
one can exchange their sites and repeat the process, obtaining the following equation:

= 0.

In the above equation, C ′ is the aﬀective heat capacity of the pistons and the vessels when gas 1
is put into the vessel B and 2 into the vessel A.

With the above two equations, we expect the result of the experiment to satisfy eq.(3). In
the experiment, we need only to measure the derivatives, with respect to the Kelvin temperature
T , of the volume and the amount of the gas that is located in the vessel A. The coeﬃcients
(∂p1/∂T )V1 and (∂p2/∂T )V2 can and must be measured in other processes. In eq.(3), the diﬀerence
∆C = C ′ − C of C and C ′ is so small, compared with either C or C ′, that it can be ignored if the
accuracy is not highly needed in the measurement.

In eq.(3), all the quantities except the entropies can be measured in the experiment. If the
theory of thermodynamics is correct, the entropies of the gases can be determined from the data.
Having the method of measuring the entropy, we can use it to test various statements related to the
second law of thermodynamics, such as the law of increase of entropy[8], the Gibbs’ paradox[6]. In
addition, if both the entropy and the pressure, as functions of the state of the system, are obtained,
the chemical potential can be integrated — at least in principle, according to eq.(7). And one
can test whether the Maxwell’s relations such as eqs.(10) is valid for every thermal system, as
demanded by the theory of thermodynamics. Especially, the second equation in eqs.(10) can be
written as

It should be veriﬁed in the experiments. But, were it veriﬁed that S(T, V, n) is a homogeneous
function of V and n of order one, the above equation will be equivalent to the ﬁrst one in eqs.(10).
In the above discussion, the entropy of a thermal system of gas can be measured provided the
theory of thermodynamics is correct. As a generalization, we can conclude that, for a thermal
system, if one of its equations of state can be determined in experiment, then its entropy can be
measured by a properly designed experimental scheme. When its entropy is known, the problem
of measuring heat that it absorbs is solved — provided the theory of thermodynamics is correct.

4 Conclusions and Discussions

As we have discussed in the above, the entropy of a pure-gas system, which has three degrees of
freedom, can be measured at any given state, (T, V, n), say. For other systems with three degrees
of freedom, its entropy can be similarly measured provided one of its equations of state can be
measured state by state.

Not that the equation of state is not enough to acquire the knowledge of a thermal system[9].
Even for the simpliest case, an ideal gas, the information of its thermodynamic functions can not
be uniquely be determined by the well-known state of equation, pV = NkBT . Apart from the

7

general discussions in the courses, an interesting relativistic case has recently been discussed in
[10]. Therefore, the measuring methods for the entropy is really needed even if the equation of
state has been known.

Based on the theory of thermodynamics for quasi-static processes, two methods are provided
to measure the entropy for a gas system at any given state: One is based on eq.(3), and the other
is based on eq.(4).

The ﬁrst method is not so accurate, because there is an unknown quantity ∆C which varies
from measurement to measurement. Since this is the diﬀerence of the eﬀective heat capacities of
the vessels as well as the pistons, which are considered to remain constant if the accuracy is not
needed to be very high, it is reasonable to be considered as a constant for all the measurements
for a given state. And it is even reasonable to drop it out of eq.(3), since it is very small.

The second method is more accurate, but it is more diﬃcult to control. Note that the derivative
of V1 with respect to n1 in eq.(4) is, in fact, the partial derivative (∂V1/∂n1)T,S1. So one can derive
that, for the adiabatic isothermal line V1 = V1(T, S1, n1) where T and S1 are treated as parameters,

Using this relation, one can make the resulted entropy more accurate.

For the ﬁrst method, which obeys eq.(3), the data should be located on a 4-dimensional plane
spaned by the variables dn1/dT , dn2/dT , dV1/dT and dV2/dT . Of course, the partial derivatives,
(∂p1/∂T )V1,n1 and (∂p2/∂T )V2,n2, must be measured in other experiments. Although the entropies
of two diﬀerent kinds of gases are measured at the same time, the resulted entropy of one gas
should and must have nothing to with the other. All the above features are expected according
to the theory of thermodynamics. Were any of them spoiled, questions about the validity of
thermodynamics can be asked.

As for the second method, all the measured data of dV1/dn1 should be consentrated to a

deﬁnite value, for a given state (T, V1, n1) of gas 1.

No matter what method is used, the Kelvin temperature scale must be applied in order to
obtain the correct value of the entropy/entropies. However, in practice the usual temperature is
not the Kelvin temperature. Let the temperature in the experiment be denoted by θ, say. The
temperature T being a increasing function of θ, eq.(3) and eq.(4) are turned to be

if the derivative of T with respect to θ is unknown.

It is well known that the errors in thermal experiments are very hard to be evaluated, not
only because it is hard to control in the operations, but also because there is hardly methods,
in principle, to eliminate the errors. Without quantites related to heat, such as heat capacities,
being measured, the accuracy of the measurement methods proposed in this paper is controlable.
— At least it is the case in the second method.

As analyzed in the above, the most possible errors come from the following points:

dθ

(1) In what extent we can set the whole system to be thermally isolated from its surroundings;

(2) In what extent the temperature scale leaves from the Kelvin temperature scale.

And, for the ﬁrst method, it also depends that the quantity ∆C varies rather small from measure-
ment to measurement, namely, the eﬀective heat capacity of the vessels and the pistons remains
steadily in various processes within the ﬁrst order of variations of the state.

Now that we have the methods of how to measure the entropy of a system with three degrees
of freedom and one equation of state, further experiments can be designed to test the theory of
thermodynamics. For example, one can test the law of increasing of entropy, and one can test
whether the Maxwell relations such as eqs.(10) hold or not, etc.

Abstract

Suspicions that the world might be some sort of a machine or algorithm existing “in the
mind” of some symbolic number cruncher have lingered from antiquity. Although popular
at times, the most radical forms of this idea never reached mainstream. Modern devel-
opments in physics and computer science have lent support to the thesis, but empirical
evidence is needed before it can begin to replace our contemporary world view.

1 Historical notes

In a broad context, rationalism, the development of rationalism, the enlightenment
and science can be perceived as an awakening from the illusory world of the senses
(Maya in Sanskrit); as a growing awareness that ”facts” which once were perceived
as self-evident turned out to be utterly wrong. Humanity once took it for granted
that it was located at the epicentre of the Universe. A closer inspection revealed that
there is no ground to claims of any preference in location: Earth is conveniently sit-
uated in a solar system of a remote part of our galaxy, which in turn is part of
a group of galaxies and of the physical Universe as we perceive it today. People
also trusted that their bodies are made-up of solid stuff. Later on they learned that,
as their bodies consist of atomic and subatomic “point” particles, things only ap-
pear to be solidly ﬁlled, but in another perspective, space is “almost empty.” Time
turned out to be relative to the motion of observers, and space, represented by sin-
gle “particles” such as photons and neutrons, seemed to be at two or more positions
at once. On another issue, people previously thought that they have been created
in a different way than other species. As it turned out, from a biological point of

view, mankind evolved and spread just like locusts and everyone else around. This
is corroborated not only by phylogenetic evidence, but by analysis of the very DNA
code that constitutes the genetic heritage and blueprint of our ancestors and of all
living beings. Indeed, the DNA itself turns out to be a biochemical code running
on cellular computers to the effect of creating, maintaining and reproducing the
organism of which it is a part.

Further disillusionments may lie ahead. Consciousness is still an “undiscover’d
country,” and maybe it is just a manifestation of neuronal brain functions. Or, con-
sciousness may be just the opposite: transcendental. Despite the achievements of
Freud, certain dream phases are barely understood. Artists have speculated that we
are ”ﬂeshware” units inside of a simulation-computation-game that appears gigan-
tic or even inﬁnite to us. Who knows, we might have even paid for to live a life in
the twenty-ﬁrst century in a beyond fair. That is to say, we might be embedded in
a literal “game” that we chose to pass the time. To make things more realistic, all
memories of the our life in the beyond might have been erased from our immediate
memories 1 . Maybe the “meaning” of our world is rather trivial; like the simu-
lation of marketing measures for a beyond world 2 . As computers have begun to
permeate our societies, it is no wonder that the “universe as a computer” metaphor
for the physical Universe has attracted increasing attention. Perhaps some day our
own technology could achieve such visions, and put it to our practical use 3 .

In antiquity, Pythagoras (6th cent. B.C.) “considered numbers as the essence and
principle of all things, and attributed to them a real and distinct existence; so that,
in his view, they were the elements out of which the universe was constructed” (from
Bulﬁnch [5]). Plato’s (c. 427- c. 347 B.C.) emphasis in geometry, in particular his
dictum “God geometrizes” 4 was interpreted by Gauss (1777-1855) as “o theos
arithmetizei,” or “God computes.” The vision of a clockwork universe is proba-

1 This is mind-body dualism in a new form. For a concrete mind-brain interface model,
see for instance Eccles’ proposal [1]. In this view, what appears to us as the physical world
is just a simulation-computation-game; and the mind(s) of the player(s) is (are) transcen-
dental with respect to the characters in this emulation. Note the phrase “we are the dead on
vacation” in Godard’s ﬁlm Breathless.
2 This is the theme in Galouye’s Simulacron 3 already dealt in 1964 with a marketing
scenario; the novel stimulated Fassbinder’s Welt am Draht, as well the recent movie Thir-
teenth Floor. Somewhat related scripts are those of Total Recall and Matrix. In Contact,
Sagan mentions the ”Zoo hypothesis” claiming that there is somebody (in this case aliens)
watching us for ethnographic or other reasons. Philosophical speculations include Rene
Descartes’ world-as-a-lucid-dream vision [2, Meditation 1,9], and Putnam’s brain-in-a-vat
metaphor [3]; see also http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com.
3 There is a possibly apocryphal story [4, p. 127] that, when asked by his Prime Minister
Peel or by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gladstone about the usefulness of his ﬁndings,
Faraday responded, “Why, sir, there is the probability that you will soon be able to tax it.”
4 In Convivialium disputationum, liber 8,2, Plutarch stated, “Plato said God geometrizes
continually.”

bly best characterized by the (probably apocryphal) story, that when Laplace was
asked by Napoleon how God ﬁtted into his secular system of M´ecanique C´eleste,
he replied [6, p. 538], “I have no need for that hypothesis” 5 .

In his famous lecture delivered before the International Congress of Mathemati-
cians at Paris in 1900, Hilbert (1862-1943) enumerated twenty-three problems,
among them the compatibility of the arithmetical axioms (# 2), the mathematical
treatment of the axioms of physics (# 6), and the determination of the solvability
of a diophantine equation (# 10) 6 . G¨odel (1906-78), as well as Turing (1912-54)
contributed towards the (negative) solution of # 2 & # 10. They pursued a formal-
ization of mathematics by coding of axiomatic systems, either by the uniqueness of
prime factorization or by their representation as (universal) computer programs 7 .

For the ﬁrst time in human history, we are able to articulate precisely what we
mean when discussing computations. Turing’s universal computer model is mod-
elled after the syntax of everyday pencil and paper operations which children learn
at school. The paper lines are unwound into a tape, and whatever rules there are
for computing can be represented by the combination of tape, ﬁnite memory and
simple read-write operations of the Turing machine.

The notion of universal computation is robust in the sense that any universal com-
puter can emulate any other universal computer (regardless of efﬁciency and over-
head), so that it does not really matter which one is actually implemented. In a
sense, the entire class of universal computer counts as a single computer, because
they are all equivalent with respect to algorithmic emulation of one another.

Robustness is a very important concept for the matter of computational universes,
because it is not really important on which particular models or hardware these
universes are implemented; they are all in the same equivalence class. Apart from
the translation from one coding scheme to another, each one of them is equivalent
to the entire class. So, when it comes to their generic properties, it is not really im-

5 In his memoires written on St. H´el`ene, Napoleon states that he removed Laplace from
ofﬁce as Minister of the Interior [6, p. 536] after only six weeks “because he brought the
spirit of the inﬁnitely small into the government.”

7 In a postscript dated from June 3rd, 1964 [7, p. 369-370], G¨odel’s opinion is clearly
expressed, “. . . due to A. M. Turing’s work [[on the universal Turing machine]], a precise
and unquestionably adequate deﬁnition of the general concept of formal system can now be
given, the existence of undecidable arithmetical propositions and the non-demonstrability
of the consistency of a system in the same system can now be proved rigorously for every
consistent formal system containing a certain amount of ﬁnitary number theory. . . . Turing’s
work gives an analysis of the concept of “mechanical procedure” (alias “algorithm” or
“computation procedure” or “ﬁnite combinatorial procedure”). This concept is shown to
be equivalent with that of a “Turing machine.” A formal system can simply be deﬁned to be
any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas.”

portant whether automaton universes are modelled to be Cellular Automata, Turing
Machines, colliding billiard balls [8], or biological substrates. All of this means
that one is free to choose whatever computational model suits best the particular
purpose one has in mind.

G¨odel, Tarski, Turing and Chaitin, among others,revealed that, stated pointedly,
mathematical “truth” extends formal “provability.” Mathematics is incomplete, and
there always will be true theorems about a particular formal system of axioms (suf-
ﬁciently rich to contain arithmetic), such as consistency, which are not provable
“from within” that system 8 .

Wigner considered ”the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natu-
ral sciences” [10], which is usually taken for granted but which, upon inspec-
tion, seems unfounded. One obvious solution to this bewilderment seems to be the
Pythagorean assumption that numbers are the elements out of which the universe
was constructed; and what appears to us as the laws of Nature are just mathemati-
cal theorems or computations. Notice that, whereas G¨odel once and for all settled
the question of a complete ﬁnite description of mathematics to the negative, the
question of whether or not a ﬁnite mathematical treatment of the axioms of physics
exists (Hilbert’s problem # 6) remains open.

Another thread was opened by Edward Moore. Puzzled by the quantum mechan-
ical feature of complementarity, Moore conceived a ﬁnite deterministic model of
complementarity capable of being run on a computer [11,12]. This formalization
of complementarity, not in terms of Hilbert space quantum mechanics, but by con-
structive algebraic, even ﬁnitistic, means, may be perceived as the continuation of
the Turing program to formalize the notion of “algorithm” or “computation” by
conceptualizing it as a concrete machine model.

In another development, Von Neumann (preceded by Ulam [13]) constructed a two-
dimensional cellular array of ﬁnite deterministic automata which are connected to
their neighbors such that the state of each one of these automata is determined by
the previous states of itself and of its neigbors [9]. He was able to show that such
cellular automata (CA) could not only be in the robust class of universal computers,
but that entities inside such arrays could reproduce themselves by holding their
own descriptional code and the algorithmic means to construct identical copies of
themselves.

8 G¨odel’s own thoughts on the interpretation of his results are formulated very nicely in
a reply to a letter by A. W. Burks, reprinted in [9, p. 55], “I think the theorem of mine
which von Neumann refers to is . . . the fact that a complete epistemological description
of a language A cannot be given in the same language A, because the concept of truth of
sentences of A cannot be deﬁned in A. It is this theorem which is the true reason for the
existence of undecidable propositions in the formal systems containing arithmetic. I did
not, however, formulate it explicitly in my paper of 1931 but only in my Princeton lectures
of 1934. The same theorem was proved by Tarski in his paper on the concept of truth . . .”

4

Stimulated by Von Neumann’s concept of CA, Konrad Zuse, the creator of one
of the ﬁrst general purpose digital computers, suggested to look into the idea that
physical space itself might actually be such a “calculating space” (“Rechnender
Raum”) [14,15,16]. In this view, the physical objects exist as computational entities
immersed in such a computational medium. Zuse became fascinated by the idea of
going beyond quantum mechanics in discretizing physics 9 , a vision he shared
with the late Einstein 10 and many researchers, among others Fredkin, Toffoli,
Margolus, and Wolfram.

Fredkin and Toffoli investigated reversible CA, in which the global temporal evo-
lution can be inverted uniquely. That is, any CA conﬁguration has a unique prede-
cessor and a unique successor. Note that, if the evolution is a bijective map; i.e., is
one-to-one for every single cell, then the global array is a reversible CA as well.
(The converse need not be satisﬁed.) For a concise account 11 the reader is referred
to the reviews by Toffoli & Margolus [19], Fredkin [20] and Wolfram 12 . In a re-
versible world, nothing is lost or gained; and all revelations are permutated back
and forth. In this sense, the very concept of question and answer, of problem and
solution, of past, present and future, and thus of a directed “lapse of time,” remains
relative, subjective and conventional [23].

9 Quantum theory just discretizes the number of quanta within a mode, yet the modes
themselves are still continuous.
10 In [17, p. 163], Einstein states, “There are good reasons to assume that nature cannot be
represented by a continuous ﬁeld. From quantum theory it could be inferred with certainty
that a ﬁnite system with ﬁnite energy can be completely described by a ﬁnite number of
(quantum) numbers. This seems not in accordance with continuum theory and has to render
trials to describe reality with purely algebraic means. However, nobody has any idea of how
one can ﬁnd the basis of such a theory.”
11 Reversibility of CA should not be confused with Bennett’s strategy to produce “re-
versible” calculations from irreversible ones by temporarily copying their intermediate re-
sults and permanently copying their ﬁnal result, thereby setting the computing agent to its
initial state, as well as retaining the result of the computation [18]. Any such operation must
necessarily allow for copying; i.e., for a one-to-many evolution, which is clearly not meant
here.
12 Wolfram recently self-published a long-awaited and widely publicised book which,
among other issues, deals with some of the rules categorized for one-dimensional automata
[21] and their conceivable physical applications. It has been received ambivalently with
reviews ranging from the author doing nice computer graphics to becoming the biggest
physics guru of all times [22]. Wolfram has attracted a lot of attention for this subject; and
it can only be hoped that the many claims made in this opus will not deter others.

2 Intrinsic randomness and undecidability

Contemporary theoretical physics postulates at least three types of randomness: (i)
the “chaotic” randomness residing in the initial conditions, which are assumed to
be “drawn” (via the postulated axiom of choice) from a “continuum urn.” Almost
all elements of the continuum are nonrecursively enumerable and even random;
i.e., algorithmically incompressible [24,25,26]; (ii) the random occurrence of in-
dividual quantum events such as a detector click; (iii) complementarity; i.e., the
impossibility to measure two or more observables with arbitrary precision at once.

2.1 Computational complementarity

As already mentioned, Moore [11] invented (parts of) ﬁnite automata theory to for-
malize and model physical complementarity. Research in this area became totally
separated from its original physical perspective and developed into a beautiful al-
gebraic theory of its own [27]. Finkelstein [28] rediscovered Moore’s paper and
coined the term “computational complementarity.” Its concrete logico-algebraic
structure has been investigated by the author in a series of papers with C. and E.
Calude, Khoussainov, Lipponen, Schaller and others [29,30,31,32], also in the con-
text of reversible computation [33,34]. Automaton logic turns out to be logically
equivalent [35] to generalized urn models [36,37], indicating that the associated
logico-algebraic structure is more robust than could be assumed from those single
model types alone.

Arguably, the simplest automaton model featuring complementarity is a ﬁnite
(Mealy) automaton in which the sets contain three internal states S = {1, 2, 3},
three input symbols I = {1, 2, 3}, and two output symbols O = {0, 1}. Let, for
s ∈ S, i ∈ I, the (irreversible “guessing”) output function be l (s, i) = d si. The (irre-
versible) transition function just steers the automaton into a state corresponding to
the input symbol; i.e., t(s, i) = i. The problem of ﬁnding an unknown initial state
by analysis of experimental input–output sequences yields a partitioning of the in-
ternal states {{1}, {2, 3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}, and {{1, 2}, {3}}, according to the input
1, 2, and 3, respectively. Every one of the partitions constitutes a Boolean alge-
bra whose elements are comeasurable. The pasting of these three Boolean algebras
along their common elements (in this case just /0 and {{1, 2, 3}}) yields a nonclas-
sical, nondistributive logical structure MO3, which is also realized by the algebra
of propositions associated with the electron spin state measurements along three
different directions.

A systematic investigation shows that the logico-algebraic structures arising from
computational complementarity are very similar to those encountered in quantum
logics [32, Sec. 3.5.2]. In particular, any ﬁnite quantum (sub-)algebra can be rep-

6

resented as an automaton logic and thus can be modelled with a ﬁnite automaton.
Clearly, inﬁnite quantum structures, such as the continuous “Chinese lantern” lat-
tices MOc involved in electron spin state measurements in continuous directions,
or quantum contextuality, cannot be modelled with a ﬁnite automaton.

Although computational complementarity will not be reviewed any further here, it
should be mentioned that Moore conceptualized input/output experiments on ﬁnite
automata, making a distinction between “intrinsic” cases where only one automaton
is available, and those in which an arbitrary number of identical copies are accessi-
ble. In the latter case, there is no complementarity, because after any experiment it
is always possible to dispose of the used automaton and get a fresh automaton copy
for further experiment(s).

The intrinsic, embedded, case is the one experienced in physics, because the ob-
server cannot escape and always is part of the (“Cartesian prison” [2, Meditation
5,15]) system. Due to restrictions in copying and cloning, it is not possible, for
instance, to obtain an identical copy of a single photon or electron in a nonclas-
sical state. And only in the single automaton case there is a chance to experience
complementarity, for only in this case it may happen that, after answering to some
query, the automaton undergoes an irreversible transition, making it impossible for
the experimenter to probe a different observable (and vice versa). Reversibility does
not change the picture, since if both the observer and the observed object were im-
mersed in a reversible environment, then the experiment could be “undone” and
the original automaton state reconstructed only at the price of loosing all the infor-
mation gathered so far [38]. This is an analogue to the quantum eraser experiment
[39] and other setups (e.g., [40]) developed for demonstrating the feasibility of a
reconstruction of quantum states.

Bear in mind that complementarity is not only a feature of exotic ﬁnite models
which were specially crafted for this particular purpose. Since these ﬁnite models
represent a subset of objects that can be simulated by any universal computer, such
as a CA or a Turing machine, complementarity is, in a sense, a generic and robust
property of all computational universes.

2.2 Intrinsic undecidability

The quest to translate G¨odel-Turing type recursion theoretic undecidability into
physics has a long history. G¨odel himself did not believe that his results have any
relevance for physics, at least not for quantum physics 13 . Early on, Popper specu-

13 In [41, 140-141], Bernstein writes, Wheeler said, “I went to G¨odel, and I asked him,
‘Prof. G¨odel, what connection do you see between your incompleteness theorem and
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle?’ I believe that Wheeler exaggerated a little bit now.
He said, ‘And G¨odel got angry and threw me out of his ofﬁce!’ Wheeler blamed Einstein

7

lated about limits of forecast in the light of these ﬁndings [42]. More recent unde-
cidability results are based on physical conﬁgurations which are provably unsolv-
able through the reduction to the halting problem (e.g., [43,44,45]).

Indeed, since the Turing machine is modelled after a paper and pencil real world
scenario, universal computers can be embedded into certain physical systems ca-
pable of universal computation. Undecidabilities can then be obtained almost as a
“free lunch;” i.e., by reduction to the recursive unsolvability of certain prediction
problems, such as the halting problem.

So, why do people such as Casti 14 , who had been very interested in the subject,
consider this issue as a “red herring?” Maybe because so far not a single prob-
lem of relevance in physics not constructed for this particular purpose is provably
undecidable.

2.3 Continuum versus discrete physics

The conceptualization of the number system—from just a few ﬁnger counts to
the natural numbers, the integers, rationals, reals [48] and further on to complex
numbers, quaternions and hyperreals is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and
greatest achievements of humanity. Nevertheless, as more and more abstractions
enter these great patterns of thought, one is compelled to question their practi-
cal physical relevance. Clearly, for instance, inﬁnite divisibility (from the rational
onwards) and continuity (from the reals onwards) ﬁnd strong pragmatic justiﬁca-
tions by their applicability to almost all branches of theoretical physics, including
quantum mechanics. Even so, some doubts as to the appropriateness of transﬁnite
concepts in physical modelling remain [49]. Let us state the following correspon-
dence principle between physical phenomena and their models [50]: every feature
of a computational model should be reﬂected by the capacity of the corresponding
physical system. Conversely, every physical capacity, in particular of a physical
theory, should correspond to a feature of an appropriate computational model.

Nature does not seem to allow Zeno squeezing [51,52,53,54,55,56,57,29,33] and
other transﬁnite processes. It could therefore be conjectured that, as physical sys-
tems do not possess adequate transﬁnite capacities, only ﬁnite computational mod-
els ought to be acceptable for theoretical modelling. This still admits universal com-
putation and ﬁnite automata, but it wipes out classical, nonconstructive continua.

for this. He said that Einstein had brain-washed G¨odel against quantum mechanics and
against Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle! (The author has asked professor Wheeler and
got this anecdote conﬁrmed.)
14 Casti (co-)organized two conferences; one in Santa Fe [46] and one in Abisco [47],
bringing together many who were interested in this issue at the time.

8

Having said this, there may be some indication of absolute randomness involved
in certain quantum measurements, though. Suppose a single electron is prepared
in a particular spin state in one direction q p. Assume further that its spin state is
not measured in this particular direction, but in another direction q m. Then quan-
tum mechanics predicts that the probability that identical spin states are measured is
sin2[(q p −q m)/2]; for non-identical result the probability is 1−sin2[(q p −q m)/2] =
cos2[(q p − q m)/2] (classically, one would expect linear dependencies on the mea-
surement angles, such as |q p − q m|/p and 1 − |q p − q m|/p
, respectively). Moreover,
quantum mechanics postulates that these outcomes are stochastic and cannot be
reduced to some form of microscopic law governing the single measurement out-
comes. At q p − q m = p /2, a series of such experiments, when coded into a 0, 1-
sequence, is postulated by the quantum mechanical canon to render an algorithmi-
cally incompressible random sequence [58]; a fact which can be used to construct
a plug-in device [59]; just like another card which can be inserted into a computer
and facilitates the desired function, in this case the production of random data.

Here seems to be a physical source of absolute randomness [24,25,26] which ap-
pears almost totally “free” of any computational costs. Just detune preparation and
measurement to attain the goal of a perfect random number generator. Indeed, this
quantum postulate of microphysical randomness seems to be a remarkable fact, in
particular since randomness is a valuable resource which, in the context of univer-
sal computation, cannot be obtained “for nothing.” Although “almost all” reals are
random, it is hard (indeed impossible) to come by any concrete element with that
property. The closest one could get may be Chaitin’s W
number, which is the Kraft
sum of the length of all preﬁx-free halting programs on some universal computer
(see [24,25,26] for details). It is even possible to write down a ﬁnite program for
computing the ﬁrst bits of W
, but for better precision there is no computable radius
of convergence certifying that a particular ﬁnite sequence is the starting sequence
for W
resembles Specker’s sequence of rational numbers with
non-recursive limit, or the Busy Beaver function [60,61,62].

. In that respect W

So, is every electron a point particle capable of transﬁnite computations? While
electrons do not seem to possess any capacity of universal computation at all,
they appear just to be perfect random number generators. That is indeed amazing!
Maybe we just have not listened carefully enough when crafting the computational
models appropriate for physics. Is Turin’s universal computer model, appended
with an additional “random oracle” plug-in, sufﬁcient?

In another scenario, an electron might just be coded to carry the answer to a single
question; e.g., related to its spin state in a particular direction. If requested to answer
a different question, such as about its spin state in a different direction, it might just
churn out random nonsense [63] according to Malus’ law [64,65]. Or, it may need
an interface, an environment or measurement apparatus translating the observer’s
question to the language (or question) understandable by the object [38,34], thereby
introducing stochastic noise by uncontrollable macroscopic processes. So far, these

9

are all metaphysical speculations which need to be sorted out by operational means,
i.e., by experiment.

2.4 Nonlocality & contextuality

Quantum nonlocality is a phenomenon which can be quite easily described, yet
remains mysterious. Consider again the spin state measurements of electrons. Let
us assume that it is possible to produce two particles in a singlet state, such that,
when their spin is measured along an arbitrary but identical direction, their spin
states are opposite. Now, consider the correlation of their spin states when mea-
sured along arbitrary but different directions. As it turns out, if the directions are
different from 0 and from integer multiples of p /2 or p
, the quantum correlations
are either weaker or stronger than the classical correlations. This is related to the
difference of the aforementioned quantum probabilities versus the classical ones.
In terms of elementary physical events, one obtains more or fewer joint clicks in
the detectors measuring the spin states than would be conceivable classically for
any such state. The doctrine of “peaceful coexistence” between relativity theory
and quantum mechanics [66] assures that this feature cannot be used for faster than
light quantum signalling [67,68,69].

Can CA with local neighbourhood cell evolution reproduce quantum-type nonlo-
cality? That seems to be a hard problem, in particular if one clings to the idea of
evolution functions which only depend on the neighbourhood, a property which
surely seems to be a constituent element in the deﬁnition of CA. Indeed, with re-
gards to nonlocality, little convincing evidence and comfort has been given so far
by the CA community. Zuse mentions the chess metaphor of the bishop, a piece
which can move in single-colour diagonal direction only, thereby exerting a non-
local inﬂuence on the entire chessboard [16]. But how could the entire chessboard
know of the bishop’s motion if information can only propagate by one cell per time
step? Considering quantized cells is no solution, because the quantum nonlocali-
ties introduced by proper normalization of the entire ray wave function comes as
no surprise [70]: quantum behaviour of a quantized system is indeed to be expected.

Another, entirely different and radical possibility would be to give up the notion
of “calculating space” and consider a computational substratum which is nonlocal
from the very beginning. In this approach, the cellular space does not correspond to
anything which is spatially extended from a physical point of view, such as the tes-
selated conﬁguration space Zuse had in mind. Rather, it might be some kind of gen-
eralized phase space, in which physical states are discrete. This resembles the “old”
quantum mechanics of Planck and Einstein 15 and known as Bohr-Sommerfeld

15 As expressed by Planck [71, p. 387], “Again it is conﬁrmed that the quantum hypothesis
is not based on energy elements but on action elements, according to the fact that the
volume of phase space has the dimension h f .”

10

“quantization.”

Contextuality is another controversial issue which is discussed in the quantum con-
text [72]. One may argue that as it cannot be operationalized anyway, contextuality
is a property of almost pure theoretical value, such as counterfactuals or scholastic
infuturabilities. In continuum theory, there are “exotic” ways to come by [73,74],
but this is no option for a discrete model. At ﬁrst sight, classical computers seem
to be value deﬁnite and noncontextual, but a closer inspection reveals that there
are subtleties to be kept in mind. Value deﬁniteness need not imply that an agent
is prepared to answer any experimental question. Indeed, in contradistinction to
Kant’s transcendental ideal 16 , and scholastic, theological speculations whether or
not the omniscience of God extends to events which would have occurred if some-
thing had happened that did not happen, which have been so powerfully formalized
into a ﬁnitistic proof (cf. [76, p. 243] and [77, p. 179]), some properties may not
be properly deﬁnable for certain computational agents, and therefore may not be
operational. For example, if an agent trained to wash dishes is confronted with the
task to write a book on hiking trails in New Zealand’s Waitakere ranges, it will
most certainly be at a complete loss. Or an agent advised to direct some parties to
a path on the right hand side when asked for right or left, will most certainly be at
a loss when asked whether to proceed up or down. The agent simply would not be
programmed and thus not be prepared to answer any type of question, but rather
only a small selection from among all conceivable questions.

3 Intrinsic, embedded observer mode

Computational complementarity and undecidability in general are good examples
of how the science of systems may enter physics. Unless one accepts the concept
of an “intrinsic embedded mode,” computational complementarity disappears into
thin air. And since system science seems foreign to most physicists, it is hard to see
if and when such concepts will be more broadly comprehended.

As with all general concepts, it is hard to pinpoint when exactly the concept of
an intrinsic embedded observer was formulated for the ﬁrst time 17 . Boskovich

16 In the 3. Hauptst¨uck, 3. Abschnitt. Von dem transzendentalen Ideal (Prototypon transs-
cendentale), of “Kritik der reinen Vernunft,” [75], Kant states, “But again, everything, as
regards its possibility, is also subject to the principle of complete determination, according
to which one of all the possible contradictory predicates of things must belong to it.” The
German original reads, “Ein jedes Ding aber, seiner M¨oglichkeit nach, steht noch unter
dem Grundsatze der durchg¨angigen Bestimmung, nach welchem ihm von allen m¨oglichen
Pr¨adikaten der Dinge, sofern sie mit ihren Gegenteilen verglichen werden, eines zukommen
muß.”
17 One is also tempted to mention Archimedes’ “points outside the world from which one
could move the earth.” Mind that Archimedes’ use of “points outside the world” was in

11

[78] around 1755 referred to the fact that embedded observers cannot recognize
an overall change (squeeze, dilatation and contraction) of the system size 18 . More
recently, Toffoli [79] discussed the role of the observer in uniform systems. Embed-
ded observers are the big issue in relativity theory, because Einstein insisted on op-
erational methods available within the system only in deﬁning clocks, length scales,
and when comparing them 19 . R¨ossler [84,85] and the author [80,81,82,86,29], in-
dependently share similar concepts, although R¨ossler’s emphasis has been on the
role of the interface between observer and observed object [87] rather than on con-
crete examples of automaton logic or space-time frames 20 .

4 Space time frames of intrinsic observers

Relativity theory has altered the way we think of space and time from a formal point
of view, but the perception of space and time at large, and what meaning is ascribed
to these notions, has not changed too much: while pre-relativistic “Galilean” type
thinking considered space and time as absolute and immutable, nowadays this role
is ascribed to the relativistic forms of space time coordinates and their transforma-
tion laws. It is almost as if the attitude of the protagonists remained the same, but
their message changed slightly.

Relativity theory, as introduced by Einstein, at least in the ﬁrst, cinematic, part
of the seminal 1905 paper [92], is conceived as a strictly operational theory for

a mechanical rather than in a metatheoretical context: he claimed to be able to move any
given weight by any given force, however small.
18 In [78], Boskovich states, “. . . And we would have the same impressions if, under con-
servation of distances, all directions would be rotated by the same angle, . . . And even if the
distances themselves would be decreased, whereby the angles and the proportions would
be conserved, . . .: even then we [[the observers]] would have no changes in our impres-
sions. . . . A movement, which is common to us [[the observers]] and to the Universe, cannot
be observed by us; not even if everything would be stretched or shrinked by an arbitrary
amount.”
19 The author had some problem to publish a paper on embedded observers in relativity
theory, apparently because of the rather unconventional nature of the subject. However,
after an appeal, the paper became preprint # LBL-16097 [80] and was later published in a
revised version [81] (see also [82]). I write this to encourage young researchers not to give
up in pursuing their own nonfashionable ideas [83].
20 When I was invited to participate to a Linz “Ars electronica” conference on “endo-
physics” in 1992, I was almost shocked by the similarity between R¨ossler’s thoughts and
the ones I had pursued. Reimara R¨ossler cautioned her husband to commit himself too
much to “endophysics,” as this might ruin his reputation in the “chaos” community. One
follow-up meeting was organized by Atmanspacher in Germany [88]. I later learned that for
researchers trained in mathematical system science, like John Casti, embedded observers
sounded like a very familiar, almost self-evident concept. [89,90,91].

embedded, intrinsic observers. Those observers are bound to use the methods and
capabilities of the system of which they are an integral part; and they cannot re-
sort to an extrinsic, “God’s eye” overview of it. But operationalism is not enough
to create space-time frames. What is also needed (but seldom mentioned although
implicitly assumed) are conventions for measuring time and space, and for compar-
ing those scales at different locations and different times in co-moving and other
experimental conﬁgurations. Indeed, the International System of units outrightly
declares a previously experimental physical fact to be convention. The speed of
light is assumed to be constant for all reference frames. With the mild side as-
sumption of the one-to-oneness (invertibility) of space-time transformation, this
convention declares the preservation of light cones, and thus, by the preservation
of set theoretic intersections of light cones such as time- space- and lightlike oned-
imensional subspaces, results in afﬁnity and linearity of the transformation laws.
From this point of view, the Lorentz transformation are a geometric statement,
and not a physical statement. In geometry, this is known as Alexandrov’s theorem
[93,94,95,96,97,98,99].

So, in a sense, this is the big picture. If one requires invariance of some “fundamen-
tal” speed and bijectivity of the transformation laws, then the Lorentz-type trans-
formation laws containing that “fundamental” speed follow. Thereby, it makes no
difference whether the associated observers are embedded in the “real” Universe,
in a CA, or in a plum pudding; as long as these conditions and conventions are
met, then Alexandrov’s theorem certiﬁes that the geometry is a relativistic one. For
discrete models, these results will always be only approximations which are valid
down to scales where the discreteness becomes important.

Where is all the physics gone? The answer to this question is that the physics is
in the invariance with respect to any such Lorentz-type transformations. For exam-
ple, clocks governed by electromagnetic phenomena will be showing the “right”
time in all frames if the “fundamental” speed is chosen to be the speed of light.
Sound clocks tick invariantly in the respective system if the “fundamental” speed
is the speed of sound. Scales are invariant if the forces stabilizing that scales are
electromagnetic ones and the “fundamental” speed is again chosen to be the speed
of light. So, with these new conventions, the invariance of certain length [100] and
time scales, corresponding to the relativistic form invariance of the laws governing
them, becomes a physical statement [101,100,102,103].

The following is an example [104] of an Einstein synchronisation by clocks gen-
erating radar coordinates in a one-dimensional CA with the following evolution

Here, X stands for any state except the ones already speciﬁed. These rules look a lit-
tle bit “murky,” but they can be simulated by any universal CA and they serve their
purpose to demonstrate clock synchronization procedures. (Actually, this pattern
was generated automatically by a CA simulator from the above rules.)

Assume two clocks at two arbitrary points A and B in the CA which are “of similar
kind.” At some arbitrary A-time tA a ray goes from A to B. At B it is instantly
(without delay) reﬂected at B-time tB and reaches A again at A-time tA′. The clocks
in A and B are synchronized if tB −tA = tA′ −tB. The two-ways ray velocity is given
by 2|AB|/(tA′ − tA) = c, where |AB| is the distance between A and B. In Fig. 1(a),
an example of synchronization between two clocks A and B is drawn.

What happens with the intrinsic synchronization and the space-time coordinates
when observers are considered which are in motion with respect to the CA? For
simplicity, suppose a constant motion of v automaton cells per time cycle. With
these units, the ray speed is c = 1, and v ≤ 1. There are numerous ways to simulate
sub-ray motion on a CA. In what follows, the case v = 1/3 will be studied in such
a way that every three CA time cycles the walls, symbolised by I, move one cell to
the right.

Notice that two clocks which are synchronized in a reference frame which is at rest
with respect to the CA medium are not synchronized in their own co-moving refer-
ence frame. Consider, as an example, the CA drawn in Fig. 1(b). (Strictly speaking,
the CA rule here depends on a two-neighbor interaction.) For tA = 1, tB = 4, tA′ = 5,
and 4 − 1 6= 5 − 4, if the ﬁrst clock is corrected to make up for the different time
of ray ﬂights as in Fig. 1(c), tA = 2, tB = 4, tA′ = 6, and 4 − 2 = 6 − 4. Then, this
correction amounts to an asynchronicity of the two ray clocks with respect to the
“original” CA medium.

5 Now what?

Despite all these efforts, including those of the author presented above, the com-
putational approach to understanding universes has so far resulted in little or no
phenomenological impact; not to speak of any “killer application”—a problem of
physics that yields to this analysis but no other—which would make the few critics
and the many hesitant researchers listen to the subject. Large segments of theoreti-
cal physics nowadays in other areas such as string theory or quantum gravity appear
to be in the very same position, but this is big comfort. In search for applications of
the idea of computational universes let us shortly discuss some of the predictions
of the subject and their possible empirical validation or falsiﬁcation.

5.1 New range of phenomena

With regards to the logical order of propositions, there may exist phenomena per-
ceivable by intrinsic, embedded observers which cannot happen according to quan-
tum mechanics but are realizable by ﬁnite automata. The simplest case is charac-

Fig. 2. a) Greechie and b) Hasse diagram of a logic featuring complementarity which is
not a quantum logic but which is embeddable in a Boolean logic.

terized by a Greechie hyperdiagram of triangle form, with three atoms per edge. Its
automaton partition logic is given by

{{{1}, {2}, {3, 4}}, {{1}, {2, 4}, {3}}, {{1, 4}, {2}, {3}}}.

(2)

A corresponding Mealy automaton is h{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, d = 1, l i,
where l (1, 1) = l (3, 2) = l (2, 3) = 1, l (3, 1) = l (2, 2) = l (1, 3) = 2, and l (2, 1) =
l (4, 1) = l (1, 2) = l (4, 2) = l (3, 3) = l (4, 3) = 3.

Figure 2 depicts the Greechie and Hasse diagrams of this propositional structure.

The physical interpretation of Eq. (2) is the following: there exist six observables
{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 4}, {2, 4}, and {3, 4}; i.e., {3, 4} corresponds to “ the system is
in state 3 or in state 4.”

They are grouped into three partitions of {1, 2, 3, 4}, such that within each group the
observables are comeasurable. For instance, in the automaton example enumerated
above, the experiment with the input of symbol 2 differentiates between {1, 4},
{2}, {3} and all properties obtained by forming the logical “or” operation, such
as {2, 3}. But the experiment does not reveal all conceivable propositions, such
as {1, 2}. Another experiment with the input of symbol 3 does, but cannot reveal
other properties, such as {1, 4}. Because of this complementarity, the propositions
are nonclassical, in particular they do not obey the distributive law: since {1, 3} ∨
{2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4},

{1, 2, 4} ∧ ({1, 3} ∨ {2, 3}) = {1, 2, 4} ∧ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 4}

= ({1, 2, 4} ∧ {1, 3}) ∨ ({1, 2, 4} ∧ {2, 3}) = {1, 2}.

16

This humble propositional structure is thus non-classical, but quite remarkably it
also cannot be realized by quantum mechanics. The complementary groups are in-
terlocked in a triangle form, which is forbidden by the Hilbert space based algebraic
structure of quantum mechanics: In analogy to Kochen and Specker [105], we de-
note by the symbol “⊥” the binary relation of comeasurability. Any sequencing of
observables such as

{1} ⊥ {3, 4} ⊥ {2} ⊥ {1, 4} ⊥ {3} ⊥ {2, 4} ⊥ {1}

(with {1} 6⊥ {1, 4} 6⊥ {2, 4} and so on) cannot occur in quantum mechanics. Hence,
if this propositional structure is experienced in some physical setup, then quantum
mechanics is not an appropriate theoretical representation for it. Computational
universes would be a natural candidate.

5.2 Coarse grained structure of digital space

Already Zuse mentioned that, if space is tesselated, then this tesselation will even-
tually show up; either by some anisotropy or by a fundamental length scale. No
indication is given exactly when this granularity should show up; and problems
abound [106]. By the way, there is no guarantee that space and time will be or-
ganized as a regular lattice; it may rather resemble a huge pile of more or less
randomly and densely packed sand and stabilized by whatever forces there are.

In view of the mild discreteness of quantum mechanics already mentioned earlier
(only an integer number of quanta per ﬁeld node), it might well be that we have
already unravelled the fundamental discreteness; but not in the properties where we
had expected them. So, maybe the ﬁeld nodes or phase space are more fundamental
than the frames of space and time that we use to deﬁne those ﬁelds. In this idealistic
picture, space and time may be convenient constructions of our minds to sort out
the evolution of ﬁeld modes.

5.3 Exotic probabilities

One approach to the formalism is that anything which is not forbidden explicitly is
realized 21 . As Gleason’s theorem strongly ties quantum probabilities to Hilbert
space, there may be non-classical and non-quantum probabilities which can be
modelled with automaton or generalized urn models.

Let us consider again spin state measurements on electrons modelled by two-
dimensional Hilbert space entities. The associated algebra of propositions consists

21 Feynman’s rule of thumb states that whatever is not explicitly forbidden is mandatory.
See also the “go-go” principle introduced in [50].

17

of (the horizontal sum of) Boolean sublattices 22 which are pasted together [107]
at their extreme elements. In this case, Gleason’s theorem does not apply. By tak-
ing the algebraic structure and the set of dispersion free (two-valued) states alone,
there exists the possibility of nongleason type probability measures. These mea-
sures have singular, separating distributions and thus can be embedded into “classi-
cal” Boolean algebras such as generalized urn und automaton partition logics. One
particular example is represented in Figure 3. Its probability measure is P(xi

and P(xi
−) = 0 for i = 1, . . ., n. The associated automaton models are
straightforward. Every such dispersion free state is obtained by associating with it
a particular automaton state. Whether or not such probability distributions exist for
fundamental processes is an open question. For spin state measurements of the elec-
trons, this does not seem to be the case, but again the question of state preparation
may be essential here.

+) = 1 − P(xi

Another more exotic example of a suborthoposet which is embeddable into the
three-dimensional real Hilbert lattice C(R3) and can also be realized by general-
ized urn models and ﬁnite automata has been given by Wright [36]. Its Greechie
diagram of the pentagonal form is drawn in Figure 4. Wright showed that the prob-
ability measure P(ai) = 1
2, P(bi) = 0, for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, as depicted in Figure 4, is
no convex combination of other pure states; and furthermore, that it does not corre-
spond to any Gleason type measure allowed as quantum probability. In this sense, it
is a “stranger-than-quantum probability.” And although automata and generalized
urn models ass well as quantum system with this pentagonally interlocking alge-
braic structure of propositions exist, no realizable probability measure on it is of the

form of Wright’s measure deﬁned above. The reason for this is the impossibility to
represent it as a convex combination of other dispersion free two-valued states.

If the physical phenomena are the intrinsic view of a mathematical or computational
universe, then any attempt to render, manipulate and change certain phenomena
could be interpreted as “reprogramming.” In fact, reprogramming or “tuning” 22
reality may be a powerful new metaphor hitherto foreign to theoretical physics.
Again, one should keep in mind that this is highly speculative.

5.4 “Tuning” reality

5.5 Against odds

Let me again emphasise that discrete or algorithmic physics may be utterly non
mainstream and off-topic, as competing with ”traditional” continuum physics is
hard. For instance, note the fabulous coincidence between the theoretical and
the experimental values of the anomalous magnetic moment of the Muon aµ,t =
11659177(7) × 10−10 and aµ,e = 11659204(7)(5) × 10−10 [108]. Or take the neu-
tron double slit experiments [109] which show a wonderful agreement of theory
and experiment.

Yet, despite all these difﬁculties, discrete computational physics certainly repre-
sents an interesting, speculative and challenging research area. Many ideas from
system science, interface design, to dualism (e.g., the Eccles Telegraph) enter. The
issue has metaphysical connotations. It is for instance quite likely that a demiurge
would create an ”atomistic” world such as ours, in which an immense (to us) num-
ber of identical gaming pieces come together to form a universe and which are
constantly rearranged to form rich and varied and seemingly complex patterns. Or
there is just one consistent Universe of Mathematics, and this is the the physical
Universe we are living in.

motives have been casted.

Abstract - We ﬁrst obtain the electric and magnetic ﬁelds corresponding
to a ‘spin’-orbit classical interaction of a r2 potential. Assuming that Maxwell
equations hold for these ﬁelds, we infer the conditions on the ‘spin’ vector
forbidding magnetic monopoles.

Let us consider Maxwell’s equations (symbols are standard ones)

where U = qΦ − (q/c) ~A · ~v (see Ref. 1). We are interested in the following
case

U = V (r) + ~σ · ~L ,

which is similar to a spin-orbit interaction for V (r) ∝ r2, though we shall
consider the ‘spin’ vector as an arbitrary classical vector. One can write the
last term as −m(~r × ~σ) · ~v. Comparing with the general case, we get

~A =

mc
q

~r × ~σ.

On the other hand, it is known that

~E = −∇Φ −

∂ ~A

~B = ∇ × ~A

and taking Φ = V (r)/q leads to

~E = −

(~r × ~σ)!

~B =

[(∇ · ~σ)~r − 3~σ] .

Plugging these results into Maxwell’s equations gives

∇ · ~B = 0 → ~r · ∇(∇ · ~σ) = 0

∇ · ~D = 4πρ → ρ = −

The ﬁrst of these results implies that nonexistence of magnetic monopoles
requires ~σ be only a linear or constant function of the coordinates with arbi-
trary explicit time dependence.

Cognitive neuroscience treats reality as our brain’s representation of our sensory inputs. In this
view, our perceptual reality is only a distant and convenient mapping of the physical processes
causing the sensory inputs. Sound is a mapping of auditory inputs, and space is a representation of
visual inputs. Any limitation in the chain of sensing has a speciﬁc manifestation on the cognitive
representation that is our perceived reality. One physical limitation of our visual sensing is the ﬁnite
speed of light. The manifestation of this limitation is the reason why the speed of light appears
at the basic structure of our space-time. Physics, however, treats the perceptual reality of space
and time (our brain’s representation) as a faithful image of the physical reality (the objects and
phenomena causing the sensory inputs). This faith in our cognitive map or perceived reality results
in attributing the manifestations of the limitations of our perception to the true nature of space and
time. In this article, we look at the consequences of the limited speed of our perception, namely
the speed of light, and show that they are remarkably similar to the coordinate transformation in
the special theory of relativity. Further illustrating the validity of looking at the visual reality as
our brain’s representation limited by the speed of light, we show that we can unify and explain a
wide array of seemingly unrelated astrophysical and cosmological phenomena using this framework.
Understanding the constraints on our space and time due to the limitations in perception and
cognitive representation opens the possibility of understanding astrophysics and cosmology from a
whole new viewpoint.

INTRODUCTION

Our reality is a mental picture that our brain creates,
starting from our sensory inputs [1]. Although this cog-
nitive map is often mistaken to be a faithful image of the
physical causes behind the sensing process, the causes
themselves are very diﬀerent from the perceptual experi-
ence of sensing. The diﬀerence between the cognitive rep-
resentation and their physical causes is not immediately
obvious when we consider our primary and most power-
ful sense of sight. But, we can appreciate the diﬀerence
by looking at our less powerful olfactory and auditory
senses. Odors, which may appear to be a property of
the air we breathe, are in fact our brain’s representation
of the chemical signatures that our nose senses. Simi-
larly, sound is not an intrinsic property of a vibrating
body, but our brain’s mechanism to represent the pres-
sure waves in the air. Table I shows the chain from the
physical cause of the sensory input to the ﬁnal reality as
the brain creates it. Although the physical causes can
be identiﬁed for olfactory and auditory chains, they are
not easily discerned for visual process. Since sight is the
most powerful sense we possess, we are obliged to accept
our brain’s representation of visual inputs as the funda-
mental reality.

TABLE I: Brain’s representation of diﬀerent sensory inputs.
Odors are a representation of chemical compositions and con-
centration our nose senses. Sounds are a mapping of the air
pressure waves produced by a vibrating object. In sight, we
do not know the physical reality, our representation is space,
and possibly time.

physiology of perception and its representation in the
brain was proven recently [2] in a clever experiment us-
ing the tactile funneling illusion. This illusion results in
a single tactile sensation at the focal point at the cen-
ter of a stimulus pattern even though no stimulation is
applied at that site. In the experiment, the brain acti-
vation region corresponded to the focal point where the
sensation was perceived rather than the points where the
stimuli were applied, proving that brain registered per-
ceptions, not the physical causes of the perceived reality.
In other words, for the brain, there is no diﬀerence be-
tween applying the pattern of the stimuli and applying
just one stimulus at the center of the pattern. Brain
maps the sensory inputs to regions that correspond to

their perception, rather than the regions that physiolog-
ically correspond to the sensory stimuli.

The neurological localization of diﬀerent aspects of
reality has been established by lesion studies in neuro-
science. The perception of motion (and the consequent
basis of our sense of time), for instance, is so localized
that a tiny lesion can erase it completely. Cases of pa-
tients with such speciﬁc loss of a part of reality [1] illus-
trate the fact that our experience of reality, every aspect
of it, is indeed a creation of the brain. Space and time
are aspects of the cognitive representation in our brain.
Space is a perceptual experience much like sound.
Comparisons between the auditory and visual modes of
sensing can be useful in understanding the limitations of
their representations in the brain. One limitation is the
input ranges of the sensory organs. Ears are sensitive in
the frequency range 20Hz–20kHz, and eyes are limited to
the visible spectrum. Another limitation, which may ex-
ist in speciﬁc individuals, is an inadequate representation
of the inputs. Such a limitation can lead to tone-deafness
and color-blindness, for instance. The speed of the sense
modality also introduces an eﬀect, such as the time lag
between seeing an event and hearing the corresponding
sound. For visual perception, the consequence of the ﬁ-
nite speed of light is called the light travel time eﬀect,
which oﬀers a convincing explanation to the observed
superluminal motion in certain celestial objects [3, 4].
When an object approaches the observer at a shallow
angle, the transverse speed may appear superluminal.

However, other consequences of the light travel time
(LTT) eﬀect are very similar to the coordinate transfor-
mation of the special theory of relativity (SR). These con-
sequences include an apparent contraction of a receding
object along its direction of motion and a time dilation
eﬀect. Furthermore, a receding object can never appear
to be going faster than the speed of light, even if its
real speed is superluminal. While SR does not explicitly
forbid it, superluminality is understood to lead to time
travel and the consequent violations of causality. An ap-
parent violation of causality is one of the consequences of
LTT, when the superluminal object is approaching the
observer. All these eﬀects due to LTT are remarkably
similar to SR. However, LTT eﬀects are currently as-
sumed to apply on a space-time that obeys SR. It may
be that there is a deeper structure to the space-time, of
which SR is only our perception, ﬁltered through LTT
eﬀect. By treating LTT eﬀects as an optical illusion to
be applied on an SR-like space-time, we may be double
counting them.

Once we accept the neuroscience view of reality as a
representation of our sensory inputs, we can understand
why the speed of light ﬁgures so prominently in our phys-
ical theories. The theories of physics are a description of
reality. Reality is created out of the readings from our
senses, especially our eyes. They work at the speed of
light. Thus the sanctity accorded to the speed of light is
a feature only of our reality, not the absolute, ultimate
reality which our senses are striving to perceive. When it

2

comes to physics that describes phenomena well beyond
our sensory ranges, we really have to take into account
the role that our perception and cognition play in seeing
them. The universe as we see it is only a cognitive model
created out of the photons falling on our retina or on the
photo-sensors of the Hubble telescope. Because of the
ﬁnite speed of the information carrier (namely photons),
our perception is distorted in such a way as to give us
the impression that space and time obey special relativ-
ity. They do, but space and time are not the absolute
reality. “Space and time are modes by which we think
and not conditions in which we live,” as Einstein himself
put it.

Treating our perceived reality as our brain’s represen-
tation of our visual inputs (ﬁltered through the light
travel time eﬀect), we will see that all the strange eﬀects
of the coordinate transformation in special relativity can
be understood as the manifestations of the ﬁnite speed of
our senses in our space and time. Furthermore, this line
of thinking leads to natural explanations for two classes
of astrophysical phenomena:

Gamma Ray Bursts currently believed to emanate

from cataclysmic stellar collapses, and

Radio Sources considered manifestations of space-time

singularities or neutron stars.

Beyond unifying these apparently distinct astrophysi-
cal phenomena, the cognitive limitations to reality can
provide qualitative explanations for such cosmological
features as the apparent expansion of the universe and
the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR).
Both these phenomena can be understood as related to
our perception of superluminal objects. It is the uniﬁ-
cation of these seemingly distinct phenomena at vastly
diﬀerent length and time scales, along with its concep-
tual simplicity, that we hold as the indicators of validity
of this framework.

II. SIMILARITIES BETWEEN LTT EFFECTS
AND SR

The coordinate transformation derived in the original
paper [5] is, in part, a manifestation of light travel time
(LTT) eﬀects. This is most obvious in the ﬁrst thought
experiment, where observers moving with a rod ﬁnd their
clocks not synchronized due to the diﬀerence in light
travel times along the length of the rod.
In this sec-
tion, we will consider space and time as a part of the
cognitive model created by the brain, and illustrate that
special relativity applies to the cognitive model. The
absolute reality (of which the SR-like space-time is our
perception) does not have to obey the restrictions of SR.
In particular, objects are not restricted to subluminal
speeds, but they may appear to us as though they are re-
stricted to subluminal speeds in our perception of space
and time. If we disentangle LTT eﬀects from the rest of

SR, we can understand a wide array of phenomena, as
we shall see in this article. Although not attempted in
this paper, the primary motivation for SR, namely the
covariance of Maxwell’s equations, may be accomplished
even without attributing LTT eﬀects to the properties of
space and time.

A feature of SR is that it seeks a linear coordinate
transformation between coordinate systems in motion
with respect to each other. We can trace the origin of
linearity to a hidden assumption on the nature of space
and time built into SR, as stated by Einstein [5]: “In the
ﬁrst place it is clear that the equations must be linear on
account of the properties of homogeneity which we at-
tribute to space and time.” Because of this assumption
of linearity, the original derivation of the transformation
equations ignores the asymmetry between approaching
and receding objects. Both approaching and receding
objects can be described by two coordinate systems that
are always receding from each other. For instance, if a
system K is moving with respect to another system k
along the positive X axis of k, then an object at rest in
K at a positive x is receding while another object at a
negative x is approaching an observer at the origin of
k. Unlike SR, considerations based on LTT eﬀects re-
sult in intrinsically diﬀerent set of transformation laws
for objects approaching an observer and those receding
from him. More generally, the transformation depends on
the angle between the velocity of the object and the ob-
server’s line of sight. Since the transformation equations
based on LTT eﬀects treat approaching and receding ob-
jects asymmetrically, they provide a natural solution to
the twin paradox, for instance.

A. Perception of Speed

We ﬁrst look at how the perception of motion is modu-
lated by the light travel time (LTT) eﬀects. As remarked
earlier, the transformation equations of SR treat only ob-
jects receding from the observer. For this reason, we ﬁrst
consider a receding object, ﬂying away from the observer
at a speed β = v/c, where c is the speed of light. The ap-
parent speed βo of the object depends on the real speed
β (as shown in Appendix A 1):

βo =

β
1 + β

βo = 1

lim
β
→∞

Thus, due to LTT eﬀects, an inﬁnite real velocity gets
mapped to an apparent velocity βo = 1. In other words,
no object can appear to travel faster than the speed of
light, entirely consistent with SR.

Physically, this apparent speed limit amounts to a
, which is most obvious in its con-
mapping of c to
sequences. For instance,
it takes an inﬁnite amount
of energy to accelerate an object to an apparent speed
βo = 1, because, in reality, we are accelerating it to an

∞

∞

inﬁnite speed. This inﬁnite energy requirement can also
be viewed as the relativistic mass changing with speed,
at βo = 1. Einstein explained this mapping
reaching
as: “For velocities greater than that of light our delib-
erations become meaningless; we shall, however, ﬁnd in
what follows, that the velocity of light in our theory plays
the part, physically, of an inﬁnitely great velocity.” Thus,
for objects receding from the observer, the eﬀects of LTT
are almost identical to the consequences of SR, in terms
of the perception of speed.

FIG. 1: Comparison between light travel time (LTT) eﬀects
and the predictions of the special theory of relativity (SR).
The X-axis is the apparent speed and the Y-axis shows the
relative time dilation or length contraction.

LTT eﬀects inﬂuence the way time at the moving ob-
ject is perceived. Imagine an object receding from the
observer at a constant rate. As it moves away, the suc-
cessive photons emitted by the object take longer and
longer to reach the observer, because they are emitted at
farther and farther away. This travel time delay gives the
observer the illusion that time is ﬂowing slower for the
moving object. It can be easily shown (see Appendix A 2)
that the time interval observed ∆to is related to the real
time interval ∆t as:

for an object receding from the observer (θ = π). This
observed time dilation is plotted in ﬁgure 1, where it
is compared to the time dilation predicted in SR. Note
that the time dilation due to LTT is stronger than the
one predicted in SR. However, the variation is similar,
with both time dilations tending to
as the observed
speed tends to c.

C. Length Contraction

The length of an object in motion also appears diﬀerent
due to LTT eﬀects. It can be shown (see Appendix A 3)

that observed length do is related to the real length d as:

for an object receding from the observer with a speed of
βo. This equation also is plotted in ﬁgure 1. Note again
that the LTT eﬀects are stronger than the ones predicted
in SR.

Figure 1 illustrates that both time dilation and Lorentz
contraction can be thought of as LTT eﬀects. While the
actual magnitudes of LTT eﬀects are larger than what SR
predicts, their qualitative behavior as a function of speed
is very similar. This similarity is not surprising because
the coordinate transformation in SR is partly based on
light travel time eﬀects. If LTT eﬀects are to be applied,
as an optical illusion, on top of the consequences of SR
as currently believed, then the total observed length con-
traction and time dilation will be signiﬁcantly more than
SR predictions.

D. Doppler Shift

The Doppler shift is one of the few dynamic proper-
ties of a celestial object that we can measure directly.
The measured redshift is easily translated to a speed,
yielding a view of an expanding universe. As shown in
Appendix A 4, the redshift 1 + z depends on the real and
apparent speeds as follows:

1 + z =

1
1 + βo cos θ
β cos θ

= 1

−

where β is the real speed of the object, and βo is its
apparent speed. For a receding object (θ = π) moving at
subluminal speeds (β < 1), we can rewrite this equation
as:

If we were to mistakenly assume that the speed we ob-
serve is the real speed, then this becomes the familiar
relativistic Doppler shift formula:

1 + z =

1 + β
βo
1

−

s

1 + z =

1 + β

s

While it is interesting that we get the relativistic Doppler
shift formula, it should be noted that setting βo = β
breaks down the derivation of these equations. However,
this similarity in the forms of the ﬁnal equations is in-
dicative of the common basis in their origin.

A. Asymmetric Eﬀects

One important feature of LTT eﬀects is that they are
asymmetric in their dependence on speed; β and βo ap-
pear in odd power, so that the equations are odd. More
generally, there is a term involving the angle θ between
the object’s velocity and the observer’s line of sight. In
SR, on the other hand, β almost always appears as β2
and the equations are even. SR treats the eﬀect of motion
as a linear coordinate transformation, ignoring the angle.
Thus, in SR, the eﬀect is the same whether the object is
approaching or receding from the observer. As remarked
before, this fundamental diﬀerence can be traced back to
the assumed homogeneity of space and time in SR. The
asymmetry in LTT eﬀects, on the other hand, provides
convincing explanations to certain paradoxes: the twin
paradox, the observed superluminal motion, the causality
violation due to superluminal motion etc. At the same
time, the asymmetry makes it diﬃcult to reconcile LTT
eﬀects and SR completely.

B. Time Contraction and Length Expansion

The asymmetric consequences of LTT eﬀects include
an apparent time contraction. When an object is ap-
proaching the observer, the time at the object seems to
ﬂow at an accelerated rate for the observer. This eﬀect
is easy to understand because, as the object is approach-
ing the observer, the successive photons are emitted at
shorter and shorter distances and they take less and less
time to reach the observer, creating an illusion of an ac-
celerated time ﬂow, or time contraction.

By the same argument, the moving object appears
elongated along the direction of motion as it is ﬂying
towards the observer. Appendices A 2 and A 3 show the
mathematical details of how light travel time eﬀects re-
sult in an apparent time contraction and length expan-
sion. If ∆to is the apparent time duration as felt by the
observer and ∆t is the real time, then:

Similarly, an object of real length d appears to have an
elongated length do as given by:

IV. EXPLANATIONS BASED ON LIGHT
TRAVEL TIME EFFECT

A. Twin Paradox

The famous twin paradox in SR exploits the symme-
In this paradox,
try in its coordinate transformation.
one twin goes away to a galaxy far away, accelerating to
speeds close to c. The other one stays back on earth.
When the traveling twin comes back (again accelerating
to almost c on the way), he will be much younger than
the twin that stays back, due to time dilation. But, in
the traveling twin’s frame of reference, it is the other
twin (along with the earth) that is traveling at speeds
close to c. Thus, time dilation should apply to the one
that stays back. This paradox is resolved by arguing that
the traveling twin feels the tremendous acceleration and
deceleration, and his frame of reference is not an inertial
frame.

In the LTT picture, the time dilation equation is asym-
metric. Whatever time dilation one twin seems to feel on
the way out is compensated by an exactly same amount
of contraction on his way back. Thus, to each of the
twins, the other twin seems to be enjoying the beneﬁts
of time dilation and aging slower. But, this time dilation
happens only during the outward journey, when the twins
are going away from each other. On his way back, the
traveling twin will see the other twin aging much faster.
At the same time, to the twin that stays back, the travel-
ing twin will appear to be aging much faster. When they
meet again, there will not be any age diﬀerence.

B. Superluminality and Causality

Although superluminality is generally believed to lead
to time travel and the consequent causality violations,
SR does not explicitly state this. As quoted earlier, Ein-
stein merely remarked that “our deliberations become
meaningless” at superluminal speeds.
In any case, we
saw that for a receding object, the apparent speed could
never be superluminal. And SR considers only receding
frames of reference. In our derivations of LTT eﬀects on
length contraction and time dilation, we did not impose
the condition that β < 1.

Using our equation for time dilation, for an approach-

ing object, θ = 0.

∆to
∆t

= 1

β

−

Thus, if the object is ﬂying to the observer, up to the
speed of light (0 < β < 1), the time intervals appear
shorter and shorter. When the speed of approach exceeds
c, the apparent time ﬂows backwards. This is because a
photon emitted at a particular point along the trajec-
tory reaches the observer before a photon emitted earlier
and farther away. The order in which photons emitted by
the object reach the observer is reversed. This reversal of

5

time ﬂow will give rise to an apparent violation of causal-
ity. This violation of causality is only an LTT eﬀect (akin
to a video clip playing backwards), not a fundamental
property of space and time as currently believed. Note,
however, that astrophysical causality violations may not
be obvious. For instance, imagine a cataclysmic explo-
sion of a star and a subsequent ﬁreball. This scenario
played backwards would be a imploding ﬁreball and an
appearance of a star. We may think of it as the accretion
of matter by an invisible massive object or the birth of a
star, instead of an event showing causality violation.

sents the boundary one second later. The observer is far away
on the right hand side, O (x → ∞). The dashed ellipse is the
apparent boundary of the object, as seen by the observer.

We can measure the transverse velocity of a celes-
tial object almost directly using angular measurements,
which are translated to a speed using its known (or es-
timated) distance from us. In the past few decades, sci-
entists have observed [3, 4] objects moving at apparent
transverse velocities signiﬁcantly higher than the speed
of light. Some such superluminal objects were detected
within our own galaxy [6, 7, 8, 9]. Rees [10] oﬀered an
explanation why such apparent superluminal motion is
not in disagreement with SR based on LTT eﬀects, even
before the phenomenon was discovered.

The distortion in the perception of speed, when the
object is approaching the observer, is used to explain
the apparent superluminal motion. Figure 2 illustrates
the explanation of apparent superluminal motion as de-
scribed in the seminal paper by Rees [10]. In this ﬁgure,
the object at S is expanding radially at a constant speed
of 0.8c, a highly relativistic speed. The part of the ob-
ject expanding along the direction V1, close to the line
of sight of the observer, will appear to be traveling much
faster. This will result in an apparent transverse velocity
that can be superluminal.

Imagine an object in motion at a speed β. To an ob-
server, it appears to move with a speed of βo. The ap-

q
parent speed βo of the object depends on the real speed
β and the angle between its direction of motion and the
observer’s line of sight, θ. As shown in Appendix A 1,

βo =

Figure 2 is a representation of equation (1) as cos θ is
varied over its range. It is the locus of βo for a constant
β = 0.8, plotted against the angle θ. The apparent speed
is in complete agreement with what was predicted in 1966
(Figure 1 in the original article, Rees [10]).

For a narrow range of θ, the transverse component of
the apparent velocity ( βo sin θ ) can appear superluminal.
From equation (1), it is easy to ﬁnd this range:

Thus, for appropriate values of β(> 1
) and θ (as given
√2
in equation (2)), the transverse velocity of an object can
seem superluminal, even when the real speed is in con-
formity with the special theory of relativity.

While equations (1) and (2) explain the apparent
transverse superluminal motion the diﬃculty arises in the
recessional side. Along directions such as V2 in ﬁgure 2,
the apparent velocity is always smaller than the real ve-
locity. It can be shown that the apparent velocity of the
slower jet can never be more than the reciprocal of the
faster jet, if the real speeds are to be subluminal. This
calculation is shown in Appendix sec:jet. Thus, super-
luminality can never be observed in both the jets of a
radio source, which indeed has not been reported so far.
Near exact symmetry in extragalactic radio sources, in-
cluding subluminal jets, is also qualitatively inconsistent
with this explanation.

D. Symmetric Radio Sources

If we accept that special relativity applies to our cog-
nitive map of reality or the perceived space and time,
and that the absolute reality, of which space and time
are our perception, is free of the constraints of SR, we
can ﬁnd elegant descriptions of symmetric radio sources
and jets. Diﬀerent classes of such objects associated with
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) were found in the last ﬁfty
years. The radio galaxy Cygnus A [11], one of the bright-
est radio objects, is an example of such a radio source.
Many of its features are common to most extragalactic
radio sources: the symmetric double lobes, an indica-
tion of a core, an appearance of jets feeding the lobes
and the hotspots. Owsianik and Conway [12] and Po-
latidis et al. [13] have reported more detailed kinemati-
cal features, such as the proper motion of the hotspots
in the lobes. Here, we show that our perception of an
object crossing our ﬁeld of vision at a constant superlu-
minal speed is remarkably similar to a pair of symmetric

Consider an object moving at a superluminal speed as
shown in ﬁgure 3(a). The point of closest approach is B.
At that point, the object is at a distance of y from the
observer at O. Since the speed is superluminal, the light
emitted by the object at some point B′ (before the point
of closest approach B) reaches the observer before the

of the observer’s time is set when the observer sees the
object at B. i.e., to = 0 when the light from the point of
closest approach B reaches the observer.

The actual plot of φ as a function of the observer’s
time is given in ﬁgure 4 for diﬀerent speeds β. Note that
for subluminal speeds, there is only one angular posi-
tion for any given to. For subluminal objects, the ob-
served angular position changes almost linearly with the
observed time, while for superluminal objects, the change

This discussion shows that a single object moving
across our ﬁeld of vision at superluminal speed creates
an illusion of an object appearing at a at a certain point
in time, stretching and splitting into two and then mov-
ing away from each other. This time evolution of the
two objects is given in equation (3), and illustrated in
the bottom panel of ﬁgure 3(b). Note that the apparent
time to (as perceived by the observer) is reversed with
respect to the real time t in the region A
to B′. An
event that happens near B′ appears to happen before an
event near A
. Thus, the observer may see an apparent
violation of causality, but it is just a part of the light
travel time eﬀect.

If there are multiple objects, moving as a group, at
roughly constant superluminal speed along the same di-
rection, they will appear as a series of objects materializ-
ing at the same angular position and moving away from
each other sequentially, one after another. The apparent
knot in one of the jets always has a corresponding knot
in the other jet.

E. Redshifts of the Hotspots

In the previous section, we showed how a superlumi-
nal object appears as two objects receding from a core.
Now we consider the time evolution of the redshift of the
two apparent objects (or hotspots). Since the relativistic
Doppler shift equation is not appropriate for our consid-
erations, we need to work out the relationship between
the redshift (z) and the speed (β) from ﬁrst principles.
This calculation is done in Appendix A 4:

We can explain the radio frequency spectra of the
hotspots as extremely redshifted black body radiation,
because β can be very large in our model of extragalac-
1 + z
tic radio sources. Note that the limiting value of
|
|
is roughly β, which gives an indication of the speeds re-
quired to push the black body radiation to RF spectra.
Since the speeds (β) involved are typically very large, and
we can approximate the redshift as:

1 + z

βφ

| ≈

Assuming the object to be a black body similar to the
sun, we can predict the peak wavelength (deﬁned as the
wavelength at which the luminosity is a maximum) of the
hotspots as:

λmax

(1 + z)480nm

|

480nm

≈

βΦ
|

≈

where Φ is the angular separation between the two
hotspots.

f
This equation shows that the peak RF wavelength in-
creases linearly with the angular separation. If multiple
hotspots can be located in a twin jet system, their peak
wavelengths will depend only on their angular separation,
in a linear fashion. Such a measurement of the emission
frequency as φ increases along the jet is clearly seen in
the photometry of the jet in 3C 273 [14]. Furthermore, if
the measurement is done at a single wavelength, intensity
variation can be expected as the hotspot moves along the
jet. In other words, measurements at higher wavelengths
will ﬁnd the peak intensities farther away from the core
region, which is again consistent with observations.

F. Gamma Ray Bursts

The evolution of redshift of the thermal spectrum
of a superluminal object also holds the explanation for
gamma ray bursts (GRBs). γ ray bursts are short and
intense ﬂashes of γ rays in the sky, lasting from a few
milliseconds to several minutes [15]. The short ﬂashes
(the prompt emissions) are followed by an after-glow of
progressively softer energies. Thus, the initial γ rays are
promptly replaced by X-rays, light and even radio fre-
quency waves. This softening of the spectrum has been
known for quite some time [16], and was ﬁrst described
using a hypernova (ﬁreball) model. In this model, a rel-
ativistically expanding ﬁreball produces the γ emission,
and the spectrum softens as the ﬁreball cools down [17].
The model calculates the energy released in the γ region
as 1053–1054 ergs in a few seconds. This energy output
is similar to about 1000 times the total energy released
by the sun over its entire lifetime.

More recently, an inverse decay of the peak energy with
varying time constant has been used to empirically ﬁt the
observed time evolution of the peak energy [18, 19] us-
ing a collapsar model. According to this model, GRBs
are produced when the energy of highly relativistic ﬂows
in stellar collapses are dissipated, with the resulting ra-
diation jets angled properly with respect to our line of
sight. The collapsar model estimates a lower energy out-
put, because the energy release is not isotropic, but con-
centrated along the jets. However, the rate of the col-
lapsar events has to be corrected for the fraction of the
solid angle within which the radiation jets can appear as
GRBs. GRBs are observed roughly at the rate of once a
day. Thus, the expected rate of the cataclysmic events
powering the GRBs is of the order of 104–106 per day.
Because of this inverse relationship between the rate and
the estimated energy output, the total energy released
per observed GRB remains the same.

Symmetric radio sources (galactic or extragalactic) and
GRBs may appear to be completely distinct phenomena.
However, their cores show a similar time evolution in
the peak energy, but with very diﬀerent time constants.
Other similarities have begun to attract attention in the
recent years [20]. Treating GRB as a manifestation of
the light travel time results in a model that uniﬁes these

two phenomena and makes detailed predictions of their
kinematics.

Observer's Time t'

FIG. 5: Time evolution of the redshift from a superluminal
object. It shows the redshifts expected from an object moving
at β = 300 at a distance of ten million light years from us. The
X axis is the observer’s time in years. (Since the X axis scales
with time, it is also the redshift from an object at 116 light
days –ten million light seconds– with the X axis representing
to in seconds.)

The spectra of GRBs rapidly evolve from γ region to
an optical or even RF after-glow. This evolution is sim-
ilar to the spectral evolution of the hotspots of a radio
source as they move from the core to the lobes. The
evolution of GRB can be made quantitative, because we
know the dependence of the observer’s time to and the
redshift 1 + z on the real time t (equations (3) and (5)).
From these two, we can deduce the observed time evolu-
tion of the redshift (see Appendix A 6). We have plotted
it parametrically in ﬁgure 5 that shows the variation of
redshift as a function of the observer’s time (to). The
ﬁgure shows that the observed spectra of a superluminal
object is expected to start at the observer’s time tomin
with heavy (inﬁnite) blue shift. The spectrum of the
object rapidly softens and soon evolves to zero redshift
and on to higher values. The rate of softening depend-
ing on its speed and distance from us. The speed and
the distance are the only two parameters that are diﬀer-
ent between GRBs and symmetric radio sources in our
model.

Note that the X axis in ﬁgure 5 scales with time. We
have plotted an object with β = 300 and y = ten million
light years, with X axis is to in years.
It is also the
variation of 1 + z for an object at y = ten million light
seconds (or 116 light days) with X axis in seconds. The
former corresponds to symmetric jets and the latter to
a GRB. Thus, for a GRB, the spectral evolution takes
place at a much faster pace. Diﬀerent combinations of
β and y can be ﬁtted to describe diﬀerent GRB spectral
evolutions.

To the observer, there is no object before tomin.
In
other words, there is a deﬁnite point in the observer’s

time when the GRB is “born”, with no indication of
its impending birth before that time. This birth does
not correspond to any cataclysmic event (as would be
required in the collapsar/hypernova or the “ﬁreball”
model) at the distant object.
It is just an artifact of
our perception.

In order to compare the time evolution of the GRB
spectra to the ones reported in the literature, we need
to get an analytical expression for the redshift (z) as a
function of the observer’s time (to). This can be done by
eliminating t from the equations for to and 1 + z (equa-
tions (3) and (5)), with some algebraic manipulations as
shown in Appendix A 6. The algebra can be made more
manageable by deﬁning τ = y/β, a characteristic time
scale for the GRB (or the radio source). This is the time
the object would take to reach us, if it were coming di-
rectly toward us. We also deﬁne the age of the GRB
(or radio source) as tage = to
tomin. This is just the
observer’s time (to) shifted by the time at which the ob-
ject ﬁrst appears to him (tomin). With these notations
(and for small values t), it is possible to write the time
dependence of z as:

moving in any other direction), its appearance from our
perspective will be that of an object receding from us
roughly at the speed of light.

Thus, the appearance of all (possibly superluminal) ob-

where t is the time elapsed after the onset (= tage in
our notation), τ is a time constant and δ is the hardness
intensity correlation (HIC). Ryde and Svensson [21] re-
ported seven ﬁtted values of δ. We calculate their average
as δ = 1.038
0.014, with the individual values ranging
from 0.4 to 1.1. Although it may not rule out or validate
either model within the statistics, the δ reported may ﬁt
better to equation (7). Furthermore, it is not an easy
ﬁt, because there are too many unknowns. However, the
similarity between the shapes of equations (7) and (8)
is remarkable, and points to the agreement between our
model and the existing data.

Thus, if we picture our universe as a large number of
superluminal or hyperluminal objects moving around in
random directions, there will be a signiﬁcant amount of
low energy isotropic electromagnetic radiation. A low
energy isotropic spectrum is remarkably similar to the
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). Thus,
CMBR can be explained if we think of our visual reality
as being limited by the light travel time eﬀects. Note
than it is not just our perception that gets fooled by the
LTT eﬀects, our measurement instruments also work at
the speed of light and are subject to the same constraints.

G. Expansion of the Universe

V. CONCLUSIONS

Our perception of superluminal motion also leads to
the appearance of an expanding universe. The expansion

In this article, we started with an insight from cog-
nitive neuroscience about the nature of reality. Reality

is a convenient representation that our brain creates out
of our sensory inputs. This representation, though con-
venient, is an incredibly distant experiential mapping of
the actual physical causes that make up the inputs to our
senses. Furthermore, limitations in the chain of sensing
and perception map to measurable and predictable man-
ifestations to the reality we perceive. One such funda-
mental constraint to our perceived reality is the speed of
light, and the corresponding manifestations are generally
termed the light travel time (LTT) eﬀects. Because space
and time are a part of a reality created out of light inputs
to our eyes, some of their properties are manifestations
of LTT eﬀects, especially on our perception of motion.
The absolute, physical reality generating the light inputs
does not obey the properties we ascribe to our perceived
space and time.

Noting that SR only considers frames of reference re-
ceding from each other, we showed that LTT eﬀects are
qualitatively identical. This similarity is not surprising
because the coordinate transformation in SR is derived
based partly on light travel time eﬀects, and partly on
the assumption that light travels at the same speed with
respect to all inertial frames. In treating it as a manifes-
tation of LTT, we did not address the primary motiva-
tion of SR, which is a covariant formulation of Maxwell’s
equations, as evidenced by the opening statements of Ein-
stein’s original paper [5]. It may be possible to disentan-
gle the covariance of electrodynamics from the coordinate
transformation, although it is not attempted in this ar-
ticle.

Unlike SR, LTT eﬀects are asymmetric. This asym-
metry provides a resolution to the twin paradox and an
interpretation of the assumed causality violations associ-
ated with superluminality. Furthermore, the perception
of superluminality is modulated by LTT eﬀects, and ex-
plains γ ray bursts and symmetric jets. As we showed
in the article, perception of superluminal motion also
holds an explanation for cosmological phenomena like the
expansion of the universe and cosmic microwave back-
ground radiation. The light travel time eﬀects should be
considered as a fundamental constraint in our perception,
and consequently in physics, rather than as a convenient
explanation for isolated phenomena.

Given that our perception is ﬁltered through LTT ef-
fects, we have to deconvolute them from our perceived
reality in order to understand the nature of the absolute,
physical reality. This deconvolution, however, results in
multiple solutions. Thus, the absolute, physical reality is
beyond our grasp, and any assumed properties of the ab-
solute reality can only be validated through how well the
resultant perceived reality agrees with our observations.
In this article, we assumed that the absolute reality obeys
our intuitively obvious classical mechanics and asked the
question how such a reality would be perceived when ﬁl-
tered through light travel time eﬀects. We demonstrated
that this particular treatment could explain certain astro-
physical and cosmological phenomena that we observe.

The coordinate transformation in SR is a redeﬁnition

10

of space and time (or, more generally, reality) in order
to accommodate the distortions in our perception of mo-
tion due to light travel time eﬀects. The absolute real-
ity behind our perception is not subject to restrictions
of SR. One may be tempted to argue that SR applies
to the “real” space and time, not our perception. This
line of argument begs the question, what is real? Real-
ity is nothing but a cognitive model created in our brain
starting from our sensory inputs, visual inputs being the
most signiﬁcant. Space itself is a part of this cognitive
model. Perceptual constraints map directly to the nature
of space as we perceive it. We have no access to a reality
beyond our perception. The choice of accepting the per-
ception of reality as a true image of reality and redeﬁning
space and time as described in special relativity indeed
amounts to a philosophical choice. The alternative pre-
sented in the article is prompted by the view in modern
neuroscience that reality is a cognitive model in the brain
based on our sensory inputs. Adopting this alternative
reduces us to guessing the nature of the absolute reality
and comparing its predicted projection to our real per-
ception. It may simplify and elucidate some theories in
physics and explain some puzzling phenomena in our uni-
verse. However, this option is just another philosophical
stance against the unknowable absolute reality.

which gives,

In this section, we derive how the perception of speed
is distorted due to the light travel time (LTT) eﬀects.
We will show that the apparent speed is limited to the
speed of light when the object is receding from us.

In ﬁgure 6, there is an observer at O. An object is
ﬂying by at a high speed v = βc along the horizontal
line BAA′. With no loss of generality, we can assume
that t = 0 when the object is at B, the point of closest
approach. It passes A at time t. The photon emitted at
time t = 0 reaches the observer at time t = to, and the
photon emitted at A′ (at time t = t′) reaches him at time
t = to′. The angle between the object’s velocity at A and
the observer’s line of sight is θ. We have the Pythagoras
equations:

LTT eﬀects modulate the way we perceive time at ob-

appears to have a dilated time ﬂow. From ﬁgure 6, we
can see that θ = π for an object receding from the ob-
server. Thus, the apparent speed of a receding object
is:

speed of the object is:

The perceived length of an object in motion is aﬀected
due to LTT eﬀects. In particular, a receding object ap-
pears shorter.
In ﬁgure 7, we have the object of real
length d. The perceived length of the object is the dis-
tance between the leading edge and the trailing edge from
which the photons reach the observer at the same instant.
In ﬁgure 7, it is denoted by do. The photon emitted from
the trailing edge of the object when it is at x reaches the
observer at O at time to. At the same time, a photon from
the leading edge at x′ reaches O. But, when the leading

edge is at x′, the trailing edge is only at x′′ = x′

For a receding object θ = π. If we consider only sublu-
minal speeds, we can rewrite this as:

serve is the real speed, then this becomes the relativistic

to denotes the observer’s time. Note that, by deﬁnition,
the origin in the observer’s time, to is set to the instant
when the object appears at B.

The real position of the object at any time t is:

x = y tan φ = βt

A photon emitted by the object at A (at time t) will reach
O after traversing the hypotenuse. A photon emitted at
B will reach the observer at t = y, since we have chosen
c = 1. If we deﬁne the observer’s time to such that the
time of arrival is t = to + y, then we have:

The derivation of the kinematics is based on ﬁgure 8.
Here, an object is moving at a superluminal speed along
A
BA. At the point of closest approach, B, the object
is a distance of y from the observer at O. Since the speed
is superluminal, the light emitted by the object at some
point B′ (before the point of closest approach B) reaches
the observer before the light emitted at A
. This gives
an illusion of the object moving in the direction from B′
to A

, while in reality it is moving from A

to B′.

Thus φ1 + φ2 =

hotspots will have identical redshifts, if terms of φ3 and
above are ignored.

It is also possible to eliminate t and derive the depen-
dence of 1 + z on the apparent age of the object under
consideration, tage = to
tmin. In order to do this, we
ﬁrst deﬁne a time constant τ = y/β. This is the time the
object would take to reach us, if it were ﬂying directly
toward us. First, let’s get an expression for t/τ :

7. Estimating Real Speed from Apparent Speed

There are three unknowns (β, θ and d) and only two equa-
tions. Thus, it is always possible to impose the relativis-
tic condition (β < 1) and compute corresponding limits
on θ and d. The only way to estimate the real speed
or the angle is to have an independent (and, hopefully,
model-independent) measurement of d.

Thus, if we assume that the real speeds are limited to
β < 1, the apparent transverse speed of the receding jet
(βo
) is limited to the reciprocal of the apparent trans-
). As long as the
verse speed of the approaching jet (βo
measured angular speeds of the two jets are diﬀerent, one
can always ﬁnd an estimated distance such that the recip-
rocal inequality holds, because the system of equations
is under-constrained.

FIG. 10: Illustration of the real jet speeds (βa and βr), core
distance (d) and the angles.

Or,

In the traditional explanation of superluminality, su-
perluminal objects such as GRS 1915+105 are assumed
to be two jets emanating from a core. The axis of the
jets makes an angle θ with respect to our line of sight.
The only direct kinematic measurements we have are the
angular velocities of features (or knots) in the jets. We
have two angular rates, µa and µr, for the approaching
and receding jets. The distance of the core from us (d)
is not known. Also unknown are the real speeds of the
jets βa and βr, which are usually assumed to be the same
) are

On the Electrodynamics of Moving Particles in Gravitational Fields

CL ´AUDIO NASSIF *
Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas F´ısicas-(CBPF), Rua Dr. Xavier Sigaud 150, 22290-180,

Rio de Janeiro - Brasil. (* cnassif@cbpf.br)

In 1905, in the most meaningful article entitled On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bod-
ies, Einstein solved the old incompatibility between classical mechanics and the Maxwell
theory, leading to a reformulation of our conception of space and time. In the present
article, where the same line of reasoning of Einstein is followed with respect to the
search for a more concise and comprehensive theory by implementing new symmetries,
new conceptual groundwork will be proposed. This enables to include other ideas about
symmetry in the space-time, in such a way as to allow us to ﬁnd an uniﬁed vision for
electrodynamics and gravitation. We will initiate this inquiry by considering the motion
of a charged particle (electron) in a weak gravitational ﬁeld, such that we shall never
be able to ﬁnd its reference frame of rest (p = 0) and therefore never be able to nullify
its magnetic ﬁeld, in such a way as to always preserve the coexistence of magnetic and
electric ﬁelds ( ~E, ~B) of such particle. Following this reasoning, we will attempt to develop
a simple model of the electromagnetic nature of the electron so that the inﬂuence of the
gravitational ﬁeld over the electrodynamics in subatomic scales leads us essentially to a
reformulation in our comprehension of the space-time structure through elimination of
the classical idea of rest, which leads to a subtle modiﬁcation of the relativistic theory
by introducing the idea of a universal minimum limit of speed (V ). Such lower limit -
unattainable by the particles - represents a perfect and absolute inertial reference frame
associated to a universal background ﬁeld (a kind of non-local vacuum energy). So there
emerges a new symmetry conception for space-time at the subatomic level (V < v ≤ c),
enabling a fundamental understanding of the quantum uncertainties. Thus the structure
of space-time is extended due to the presence of a kind of vacuum energy density which
leads to a negative pressure in cosmological scales,behaving as a cosmological antigravity.

1. Introduction
In 1905, when Einstein1 criticized the existence of the luminiferous ether defended
by Lorentz2, Fitzgerald3 and Poincar´e4, he1 solved the incompatibility between
the laws of movement in the newtonian mechanics paradigm (Galileo’s principle of
addition of speed) and the laws of electrical and magnetic ﬁelds for light (speed c),
by using the following intuitive reasoning:

“If someone could move at the speed of light (c), the light ray would be standing
still in relation to such person, based on the Galilean principles of velocity addition;
however, this made no sense for the electromagnetic theory (Maxwell equation) be-
cause, if it were possible for someone to stand still over the crest of a light ray wave,
the electromagnetic wave would become stationary to such observer.Naturally, this
would lead to the rupture of the space-time dynamic symmetries which comes from
the oscillations of the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the wave”.

Such incompatibility was resolved by changing the newtonian theory, with a
correction to take into account the speed of light (c) as the maximum and constant
limit of speed in order to preserve the covariance of Maxwell’s relativistic equations.
Such equations always have the same form for any reference frame.

The speed of light in vacuum (c) is constant, that is, it does not depend on
the speed of the light source. Such reasoning led Einstein to conclude that the idea
of the luminiferous ether is not needed, since the speed of light (c) is constant.
Therefore, due to the invariance of the speed of light, the space and time measures
are relative, that is, they vary in accordance with the reference frame; other than
what was thought under the newtonian theory where c would change while space
and time remained absolute.

During the last 22 years of his life, Einstein attempted to bring the principles of
Quantum Mechanics (uncertainties) and the electromagnetic ﬁelds into the theory
of gravitation (General Relativity), by means of a Uniﬁed Field theory5. Unfortu-
nately, his uniﬁcation program was not successful in establishing a consistent theory
between Quantum Mechanics and Relativity. Currently, the string theories inspired
in an old idea by Kaluza6 7, regarding extra dimensions in space-time have been
prevailing in the scenario of attempts to ﬁnd an uniﬁed theory8 9 10.

Also driven by Einstein ideas to look for new fundamental symmetries in Nature,
our main focus in this work is to go back to that point of the ancient incompatibility
between mechanics and electrodynamics already solved by him and so extend his
reasoning in a search for new symmetries in order to try to implement now gravita-
tion into the electrodynamics of moving particles. Therefore, we intend to introduce
more symmetries in the space-time geometry where gravity and electrodynamics
become compatible with each other, in such a way to enable now to build a new
dynamics which is compatible with the quantum indeterminations, there emerging
a new space-time structure which will be denominated quantum space-time. To do
that, we shall perceive that the indispensable presence of gravity at subatomic scale
leads us to postulate the existence of a universal minimum velocity associated with
a kind of privileged background ﬁeld (a fundamental ﬂuid or energy of vacuum)
inherent to the space-time metric.

The idea of an unattainable lower speed limit in such quantum space-time im-
mediately precludes one to think about a reference frame at rest (p = 0) for all
particles and consequently also the ideal case of a free particle (plane wave), where
∆p = 0 (null uncertainty in momentum). Actually, due to the presence of gravity,
we would always have ∆pminimum > 0 11 since there is no really free particle in
1026m)
the Universe, the more so because the Universe is considered ﬁnite (R
according to some ideas 11 12.

∼

Similarly to Einstein’s reasoning, which has solved that old incompatibility be-
tween the nature of light and the movement of matter (massive objects), let us now
expand it by making the following heuristic assumption based on new symmetry
arguments:

If, in order to preserve the symmetry (covariance) of Maxwell’s equations, c

is required to be constant based on Einstein’s reasoning, according to which it is
forbidden to ﬁnd the rest reference frame for the speed of light; i.e, c
= 0 (= c)
due to the coexistence of ~E and ~B in equal-footing, then now let us think that ﬁelds
~E and ~B may also coexist for moving charged massive particles (as the electrons),
which are on a subluminal level (v < c). So, by making such assumption, it would be
also impossible to ﬁnd a rest reference frame for the massive particle by nullifying
its magnetic ﬁeld; i.e., ~B = 0 with ~E
= 0. This would break the coexistence between
these two ﬁelds, which would not be possible because now, in such quantum space-
time, it is impossible to ﬁnd a reference frame where v = 0. Thus we always must
have ~E
= 0 on the matter wave for charged massive particles (de-Broglie
wave) due always to the presence of a non-null momentum for the electron (massive
particle), in a similar way to the photon electromagnetic wave (mass-less particle).

= 0 and ~B

The reasoning above immediately leads to the following conclusion:
-The plane wave for the free electron is an idealization that is impossible to con-
ceive under the physical reality. In the event of an idealized plane wave, it would be
possible to ﬁnd the referential that exactly nulliﬁes its momentum (p = 0), just the
same way as we can ﬁnd the reference frame of rest for classical objects (macro-
scopic ones) which move in an uniform rectilineal movement, that is, a state of
equilibrium. In such idealized case, we could ﬁnd a reference frame where ~B = 0
for charged particle; however, the presence of gravity in quantum world emerges in
order to always preserve the coexistence of ~E and ~B(
= 0) in the electrodynamics
of moving massive particles, and that is the reason why we will think about a lower
non-null speed limit V forbidden in such quantum space-time structure in order to
avoid to think about ~B = 0 (v = 0). This means that, in such quantum space-time
(with gravity), there is no state of perfect equilibrium (Galilean inertial reference
frame) for moving particles, except the privileged inertial reference frame of uni-
versal background ﬁeld associated to minimum limit V . Such reasoning allows us
c′′ = c) and the matter
to think that the electromagnetic radiation (photon:“c
= 0)) are in equal-footing since now it is not possible to
(electron: “v

ﬁnd a reference frame in equilibrium (v
v = 0) for both of them through any ve-

transformations.

The range of velocities V < v

In another article, we will cover the dynamics of particles in the presence of
such universal background reference frame for V , within a context that reminds
us of the ideas of Mach13, Schroedinger14 and Sciama15, where we will think of
an absolute background reference frame in relation to which we have the inertia
of all moving particles. However, we must emphasize that the approach we intend

to use is not classical as the machian ideas (the inertial reference frame of ﬁxed
stars), since the lower limit of speed V related to a privileged reference frame of a
kind of vacuum energy comes essentially from the presence of gravity in quantum
scales of space-time, that is, a kind of quantum gravity. Thus we hope that a direct
relationship exists between such minimum speed V and Planck’s minimum length
(lp) for a quantum gravity theory where lp = (G~/c3)1/2
35m. This will lead
to think that the invariance of V may be strongly related to that invariance of lp
in Double Special Relativity (DSR)(see references [30-35]). We will see this in 4th
section.

In the next section, a model will be developed to describe the electromagnetic
nature of matter, based on the Maxwell theory used for investigating the electro-
magnetic nature of a photon when the amplitudes of electromagnetic wave ﬁelds
are normalized for one single photon with energy ~w. Thus, due to reciprocity and
symmetry reasoning, we shall extend such idea to matter (electron), through the
idea of pair materialization (e+ and e−), after photon-γ decaying.

2. The Electromagnetic Nature of the Photon and of the Matter

2.1. The electromagnetic nature of the photon
In accordance with some laws of Quantum Electrodynamics16, we may assume the
electric ﬁeld of a plane electromagnetic wave, whose amplitude is normalized for
just one single photon16. To do this, consider that the vector potential of a plane
electromagnetic wave is

(1)
where ~k.~r = kz, admitting that the wave propagates in the direction of z, ~e being
the unitary vector of polarization. Since we are in vacuum, we must consider that

where a is an amplitude which depends upon the number of photons in such wave.
Since we wish to obtain the plane wave of one single photon (~w), then, by making

have:

from where, we deduce that

where e0 could be thought of as an electric ﬁeld amplitude normalized for 1 sin-

normalized for 1 photon. Then, we may write

Introducing (8) in (3), and considering the unitary volume (vph = 1), we obtain

It is important to emphasize here that, although the ﬁeld given in (8) is nor-
malized only for one photon, it is still a classical ﬁeld of Maxwell because its value
oscillates like a classical wave (solution (8)); the only diﬀerence here is that we
have thought of a small amplitude ﬁeld for one photon. Actually, the amplitude
of the ﬁeld (e0) cannot be measured directly. Only in the classical approximation
(macroscopic case), when we have a very large number of photons (N
) can
we somehow measure the macroscopic ﬁeld E of the wave. Therefore, although we
could idealize the case of just one photon as if it were a Maxwell electromagnetic
wave of small amplitude, the solution (8) is even a classical one, as the ﬁeld ~E
presents oscillation.

→ ∞

Actually, we already know that the photon wave is a quantum wave, i.e., a de-
Broglie wave, where its wavelength (λ = h/p) is not interpreted classically as the
oscillation frequency (wavelength due to oscillation) of classical ﬁeld because, if it
were so, using the classical solution (8), we would have

In accordance with (12), if the wave of a photon were really classical, then its
energy would not be ﬁxed, as we can see in (12); consequently, its energy ~w would
be only an average value [see (10)]. Hence, in order to achieve consistency between
the result (10) and the quantum wave (de-Broglie wave),we must interpret (10) as
being related to the very electromagnetic de-Broglie wave of the photon with a ﬁxed
discrete energy value ~w instead of an average energy value, since now we consider
that the wave of one single photon is a non-classical wave, i.e., it is a de-Broglie
wave. Thus we re-write (10) simply as follows:

Eeletromag = E = pc =

where we conclude that

where λ is the de-Broglie wavelength. Now, in this case (14), the single photon ﬁeld
eph should not be assumed as a mean value for oscillating classical ﬁeld, and we shall
preserve it in order to interpret it as a scalar quantum electric ﬁeld (microscopic
one) of a photon. Then, let us also call it scalar support of electric ﬁeld , representing
a quantum (corpuscular)-mechanical aspect of electric ﬁeld for the photon. As the
e2
support eph is responsible for the energy of the photon (E

and therefore λ

p = e2

2.2. The electromagnetic nature of the matter

Our objective here is to extend the idea of photon’s electromagnetic energy [equa-
tion (13)] to matter. By doing this, we shall provide heuristic arguments that rely
directly on de-Broglie reciprocity postulate which extended the idea of wave (photon
wave) to matter (electron), which also behaves like wave. Thus, the relation (14) for
photon, which is based on de-Broglie relation (λ = h/p) may also be extended to
matter (electron), in accordance with the very idea of de-Broglie reciprocity. In order
to strengthen such argument, besides this, we are going to assume the phenomenon
of pair formation, where the photon γ decays into two charged massive particles,
namely, the electron (e−) and its anti-particle, the positron (e+). Such example
will enable us to better understand the need of extending the idea of the photon
electromagnetic mass (melectromag = Eelectromag/c2) (equation 13) to matter (e−
and e+), using that idea of ﬁeld scalar support.

Now consider the phenomenon of pair formation, i.e., γ

e− + e+. Then, using

the conservation of energy for γ-decaying, we write the following equation:

→

Eγ = ~w = mγc2 = m−0 c2 + m+

0 c2 + K − + K + = 2m0c2 + K − + K +,

(17)

(18)

where K − and K + represent the kinetic energy for electron and positron respec-
tively. We have m−0 c2 = m+

∼= 0, 51M eV for electron or positron.

Since the photon γ electromagnetic energy is Eγ = hν = mγc2 = 1

γ, or else,
Eγ = ǫ0e2
γ given in the International System of Units (IS), and also knowing that
eγ = cbγ (IS), where bγ represents the magnetic ﬁeld scalar support for the photon
γ, then we also may write:

4π e2

0 c2

Eγ = cǫ0(eγ)(bγ)

(16)

The photon has no charge; however, when it is materialized in the pair electron-
positron, its electromagnetic content given in (16) ceases to be free or purely kinetic
(purely relativistic mass) to become massive through the materialization of the
pair. Since such massive particles (v(+,
) < c) also behave like waves in accordance
with de-Broglie idea, then now it would be natural to extend the relation (14) of
the photon to represent the wavelengths of matter (electron or positron) after the
photon-γ decaying, namely:

time geometry of such basic model of uniﬁcation, where a minimum limit of speed is

A fundamental point which the present model challenges is that, in accordance
with equation (19), we see that the electron is not necessarily an exact punctual
particle. Quantum Electrodynamics, based on Special Relativity deals with the
electron as a punctual particle. The known classical theory of the electron foresees
for the radius of the electron the same order of magnitude of the radius of a proton,
i.e., Re ∼

The most recent experimental evidence about scattering of electrons by elec-
trons at very high kinetic energies indicates that the electron can be considered
approximately a point particle. Actually, the electrons have an extent less than
16m17. Of course such extent is neg-
collision distance, which is about Re ∼

ligible in comparison to the dimensions of an atom (10−

its energy and frequency increase for E′ = hν′ where

(20)

As, by convention, we have deﬁned φ > 0 for the attractive potential, then we
have ν′ > ν. Considering the relation (16) for any photon and introducing (16) in
(20), we alternatively write that

E′ = cǫ0e′phb′ph = cǫ0ephbph√g00,
where g00 is the ﬁrst component of the metric tensor where √g00 = 1 + φ

In the presence of gravity, ﬁelds eph and bph of the photon increase according to
(22), leading to the increasing of the photon frequency or energy, according to (20).

In accordance with (29), we may conclude that there is a constant of propor-
tionality which couples the external electromagnetic ﬁelds E and B of the moving
electronic charge with gravity through the small shifts δE and δB, and so this allows
us to perform such constant which functions like a ﬁne-tuning, namely:

the fact that the gravitational interaction is much weaker when compared with the

The coupling term ρ(1) represents an electromagnetic energy density of ﬁrst

It is very interesting to observe that this radiation term corresponds eﬀectively to
a certain radiation ﬁeld due to an accelerated charge in free space,according to the
equivalence principle;however,in this case,such principle must be understood as if it
were a weak way to describe the equivalence since the coupling ξ between gravity

distance r from the charged particle. It is an uniform energy density for a potential

4. The ﬁne adjustment constant ξ and its implications on the

understanding of the space-time geometric structure

Let us begin this section by considering the well-known problem that deals with
the electron in the bound state of a coulombian potential of a proton (Hydrogen
atom). We have started from this issue because it poses a certain similarity with
the present model for the electron linked to a gravitational ﬁeld. We know that
the ﬁne structure constant (αF = 1/137) plays an important role for obtaining the
energy levels binding the electron to the nucleus (proton) in the Hydrogen atom.
Therefore, in a manner similar to such idea, we plan to extend it in order to see
that the ﬁne coupling constant ξ plays an even more fundamental role than the ﬁne
structure αF by considering that ξ links gravity to the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the
electron’s charge.

Let’s initially consider the energy that links the electron to the proton at the

fundamental state of the Hydrogen atom, as follows:

∆E =

F m0c2,
α2

where ∆E is assumed as module. We have ∆E << m0c2, where m0 is the electron’s

It is interesting to observe that the relations in (36) maintain a certain similarity
with (30); however, ﬁrst of all, we must emphasize that the variations ∆es and ∆bs in
the electron energy has a purely coulombian origin, since the ﬁne structure constant

September 23, 2013 23:16 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

αF depends solely on the electron charge. Thus we could express the electric force
between these two electronic charges in the following way:

smaller than the coulombian bonding energy considered for the fundamental state
(∆E) on the Hydrogen atom.

qe), βF (m2

Now, following the above reasoning, we see that the present model enables us to
consider the very ﬁne-tuning (coupling) ξ between gravity (a gravitational potential)
generated for instance by a mass me of an electron and an electrical ﬁeld (electrical
energy density) generated by a charge qe of its neighbor (refer to (30)). Hence, in
this more fundamental case, we have a kind of bond of the type meqe (mass-charge)
through the adjustment (coupling) ξ. So the subtleness here is that the bonding
energy density due to ξ, by means of increments δE and δB (see (30), (31), (32)
or (33)) occurs on the electrical and magnetic ﬁelds generated in space by the own
charge (qe).

Although we could show a laborious and step by step problem for obtaining
constant ξ, the way we follow here is shorter because it starts from important
analogies by using the ideas of ﬁne structure αF = αF (e2) ;i.e., an eletric interaction
(charge-charge ) and superﬁne structure βF = βF (m2
e), that is, a gravitational
interaction (mass-mass ). Hence, now it is easy to conclude that the kind of mixing
coupling we are proposing, of the type “meqe” (mass-charge) represents a gravi-
electrical coupling constant, which leads us naturally to think that such constant ξ

awe must not mistake superﬁne structure βF with hyperﬁne structure (spins interaction), as they
are completely diﬀerent.

In the Hydrogen atom, we have the ﬁne structure constant αF = e2/~c = vB/c,

damental level (Bohr velocity). On this level, the electron does not radiate because
it is in a kind of balance state, in spite of its electrostatic interaction with the
nucleus (centripete force); that is, it functions as if it were efectively an inertial
system. Hence, following an analogous reasoning for the more fundamental case of
the constant ξ, we may write (41) as follows:

Similarly to the Bohr velocity (vB) for fundamental bound state, the speed V
is also an universal fundamental constant, however the crucial diﬀerence between
them is that V is associated with a more fundamental bound state in the Universe,
since gravity (G), which is the weakest interaction plays now an important role
in the dynamics of the electron (electrodynamics) in such quantum space-time.
This may be observed in (43), because if we make G

Our objective is to postulate V as an unattainable universal minimum speed
(constant) for all particles in subatomic world, but before this, we must provide a
better justiﬁcation of why we consider the electron’s mass and charge to calculate
V (V
meqe), instead of the mass and charge of other particles. Although there
are fractionary electric charges, such as is the case of the quarks, such charges are
not free in Nature for linking only with gravity. They are strongly connected by
the strong force (gluons). Therefore, the charge of the electron is the smallest free
charge in Nature. On the other hand, the electron is the elementary charged particle
with the smallest mass. Consequently, the product meqe assumes a minimum value.
In addition, the electron is completely stable. Other charged particles such as for
instance π+ and π− have masses that are greater than that of the electron and,
therefore, are unstable and decay very quickly. Such subject may be dealt with
more extensively in another article.

Now, we can really verify that the minimum speed (V ) given in (43) is directly
related to the minimum length of quantum gravitation (Planck length), as follows:

V =

theory. So we also restore the classical result from (33), i.e, ρtotal

electromag = ρ(0).

Now we can see that the universal constant of minimum speed V in (44) for very
low energies (very large wavelengths) is directly related to the universal constant of
minimum length lp (very high energies), whose invariance has been studied in DSR
by Magueijo,Smolin,Camelia et al (see references [30-35]).

The natural consequence of the presence of a more fundamental level associated
with V in the space-time geometric structure is the existence of a privileged back-
ground ﬁeld reference frame in the Universe. Such referential must be related to a
kind of vacuum energy inherent to the space-time (refer to ρ(2) in equation (33)).
Such idea reminds us of the conceptions of Mach13, Schroedinger14 and Assis18,
although such conceptions are still within the classical context.

Since we are assuming an absolute and privileged referential (V ), which is under-
lying and also inherent to the space-time geometry, we shall call it ultra-referential-
SV . By drawing inspiration from some of the non-conventional ideas of Einstein
in relation to the “ether”19, let us assume that such background ﬁeld referential
SV , which, in a way redeems his ideas, introduces a kind of “relativistic ether” of
the space-time. Such new concept has nothing to do with the so-called luminiferous
ether (classical ether) established before Relativity theory.

The present idea about a relativistic “ether” for the ultra-referential SV is aimed
at the implementation of quantum principles (uncertainties) in the space-time geo-
metric structure. This line of investigation resumes, within a concept that is more
comprehensive, those non-conventional Einstein’s ideas 19, who attempted to bring

September 23, 2013 23:16 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

art2007

15

back the idea of a new ether that cannot be conceived as being composed of punctual
particles and having a world line followed in time.

∞

Actually, such idea of “ether” as conceived by Einstein should be understood as
a non-classical concept of ether due essentially to its non-locality feature. In this
sense, such new “ether” has a certain correspondence with the ultra-referential SV
due to its totality as a physical space, not showing any movement. In fact, as SV
would be absolutely forbidden for all particles (local level) since V would prohibit
any thinking about a perfect plane wave (∆x =
), so the ultra-referential SV
would really be non-local, which is in agreement with that Einstein’s conception
about an “ether” that could not be split into isolated parts and which, due to its
totality in the space, would give us the impression that it is actually stationary. In
order to understand better its non-locality feature by using a symmetry reasoning, we
must perceive that such minimum limit V works in a reciprocal way when compared
with the maximum limit c, such that particles supposed in such limit V , other than
what would happen in the limit c, would become completely “ defrosted ” in space
), being in anywhere in space-time and therefore
(∆x
having a non-local behavior. This corresponds to the ultra-referential SV .So, as V
is the reciprocal velocity of c in such quantum space-time, we have V = a/c, where
a is a constant of proportionality such that a = cV . We will show this in the next
section.

In vain did Einstein attempt to satisfactorily redeem the idea of a new ether
under the Relativity in the various manners20,21,22,23,24,25 because, in eﬀect, his
theory wasn’t still able to adequately implement the quantum uncertainties as he
himself also tried to do26,27,28,and in this respect, Relativity is still a classical
theory, although the new conception of ether presented a few non-classical char-
acteristics.Actually,it was Einstein who coined the term ultra-referential as the
fundamental aspect of Reality. To him, the existence of an ultra-referential can-
not be identiﬁed with none of the reference frames in view of the fact that it is a
privileged one in respect of the others. In principle, this seems to contradict the
principle of Relativity, but, in vain, Einstein attempted to ﬁnd a relativistic ether
(physical-space) inherent to the geometric structure of the space-time which does
not contradict such principle. That was the problem because such new ether does
not behave like a galilean reference frame and consequently, it has nothing to do
with that absolute space fulﬁlled by the luminiferous ether, although it behaves like
a privileged background ﬁeld in the Universe.

The idea of a completely forbidden minimum movement (V ) would be capable
of better explaining, at a relativistic level, the veracity of Einstein’s insight about
the need of introducing an ultra-referential related to the physical space behind all
reference systems, because the ultra-referential SV should represent an unattainable
universal inferior limit V for all reference systems which always own velocities v > V .
As this minimum limit V is also essentially relativistic for being unattainable,
being associated to a vacuum relativistic ﬁeld ρ(2) (non-local, i.e., ρ(2)
1/r0),
we plan to demonstrate that the space-time transformations that arise from this

∝

September 23, 2013 23:16 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

theory continue in fact to preserve the covariance of Maxwell equations, insuring
that the new concept of “relativistic ether” related to the ultra-referential SV is
essentially a concept of relativistic ﬁeld, which has nothing to do with that Galilean
(classical) ether used merely as a reference system consisting of stationary points
in the hypothetical absolute space.

This research, which redeems some features of those non-conventional ideas of
Einstein regarding the introduction of a new concept of “ether” for the physical
space, seeks to naturally implement the quantum principles in such new space-time
geometric structure to be dealt with in the next section. Thus we shall note that,
thanks to the current investigation, we will see that Einstein’s non-conventional idea
about the relativistic ether and that other idea of making the quantum principles
emerges naturally from an uniﬁed ﬁeld theory are closely related to each other,
and are therefore the faces of one single fundamental reality, the geometry of which
should present three spatial dimensions in addition to two temporal dimensions (cdτ
and V dτ ). This subject shall be covered in the following section.

5. A new conception about reference systems and space-temporal

interval: a fundamental explanation for the uncertainty principle

∝

The conception of background privileged reference frame (ultra-referential SV ) has
deep new implications on our understanding of the reference systems. That classical
notion we have about the inertial Galilean reference frames where the idea of rest
exists is eliminated at a quantum level where gravity plays a fundamental role in
such structure of space-time with a vacuum energy associated to V (

G1/2/~).

Before we deal with the implications created by the implementation of such ultra-
referential SV in the space-time, let us make a brief presentation of the meaning of
the Galilean reference frame (reference space), well-known in the Special Relativity.
In accordance with that theory, when an observer assumes an inﬁnite number of
points that are at rest in relation to himself, he introduces his own reference space
S. Thus, for another observer S′ who is moving at a speed v in relation to S,
there should also exist an inﬁnite number of points at rest in his own referential.
Therefore, for observer S′, the reference space S is not standing still and has its
points moving at a speed
v. It is for this reason that there is no privileged Galilean
reference frame at absolute rest, in accordance with the principle of relativity, since
the reference space of a given observer now becomes movement to another.

−

The absolute space of pre-Einsteinian physics, connected or linked to the ether in
the old sense, also constituted by itself a reference space. Such space was assumed as
the privileged reference space of the absolute rest. However, as it was also essentially
a Galilean reference space like any other, comprised of a set of points at rest,
actually, it was also subject to the notion of movement. The idea of movement
could be applied to the “absolute space” when, for example, we assume an observer
on Earth, which is moving at a speed v in relation to such space. In this case, for
an observer at rest on Earth, the points that would constitute the absolute space of

v. Since such absolute space was linked to
v, however

−

−

Einstein has denied the existence of the ether associated to a privileged refer-
ential because it contradicted the principle of relativity; therefore, this idea of a
Galilean ether is superﬂuous, as it would also merely be a reference space, consti-
tuted by points at rest, as well as any other. In this respect, there is nothing special
in such classical ether.

However, driven by the provocation from H. Lorentz and Ph. Lenard Lorentz 19,
Einstein attempted to introduce several new conceptions of a “new ether”, which
did not contradict the principle of relativity in the Special Relativity and also in
the General Relativity (GR). After 1925, he started using the word “ether” less
and less frequently, although he still wrote in 1938: “This word ‘ether’ has changed
its meaning many times, in the development of Science... Its history, by no means
ﬁnished, is continued by relativity theory21... ”

In 1916, after the ﬁnal formulation of GR, Einstein proposed a completely new
concept for ether. Such new ether was a relativistic ether which described space-time
as a sui generis material medium, which, in no way, could constitute a reference
space subject to the relative notion of movement. Basically, the essential character-
istics of the new ether as interpreted by Einstein can be summarized in the following
manner:

-It constitutes a fundamental ultra-referential of the Reality,which is identiﬁed
with the physical space, being a relativistic ether, i.e., it is covariant because the
notion of movement cannot be applied to it,which represents a kind of absolute
background ﬁeld that is inherent to the metric gµν of the space-time;

-It is not composed of points or particles, therefore it cannot be understood as a
Galilean reference space for that hipothetical absolute space. For this reason, it does
not contradict the well-known principle of Relativity;

-It is not composed of parts; thus its indivisibility reminds the idea of non-locality;
-It constitutes a medium which is really incomparable with any ponderable
medium made from particles, atoms or molecules. Nor even the background cos-
mic radiation of the Universe can represent exactly such medium as an absolute
reference system (ultra-referential)29 ;

-It plays an active role on the physical phenomena2223. In accordance with Ein-
stein, it is impossible to formulate a complete physical theory without the assumption
of an “ether”(a non-local vacuum ﬁeld), because the whole complete physical theory
must take into consideration real properties of the space-time .

The present work attempts to follow this line of reasoning that Einstein did not
ﬁnish, by giving it a new approach with respect to the basic idea of uniﬁcation; i.e.,
the electrodynamics of a charged particle moving in a gravitational ﬁeld.

As we have interpreted the lower limit V (formulas (43) and (44)) as unattainable
and constant (invariant), then such limit must be associated to a privileged, non-
Galilean reference system since V must remain invariant for any referential with

September 23, 2013 23:16 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

art2007

18

v > V . As a consequence of such covariance of the relativistic ether SV , the new
velocity transformations will show that it is impossible to nullify the speed of a
particle over its own reference frame, in such a manner as to always preserve the
existence of a magnetic ﬁeld ~B for such charged particle in any situation. Thus we

V [Refer to the Complement 7.1, in the case (c)], consequently it is also impossible
to ﬁnd by symmetry a speed
v for the relativistic “ether” when an “observer”
ﬁnds himself on the reference system v assumed. Hence, due to such asymmetry,
v of the “ether” SV does not exist and therefore, in this sense, it mantains
the ﬂow
covariant (V ). This asymmetry breaks such equivalence by exchange of reference
frame S by S′ through an inverse transformation. Such breakdown of symmetry in
an inverse transformation due to the presence of SV will be studied in more details
in a next paper (see also Complement 7.1).

−

−

There is no Galilean reference system in this new space-time structure where the
ultra-referential SV is a non-Galilean reference system and, in addition, a privileged
one (covariant), just as is the speed of light c. Thus the new transformations of speed
shall also show that “v

Obviously, if we make V

0, we therefore recover the vality of Galilean reference
frames of Special Relativity (SR), where only the invariance of c remains. In this
classical case (SR), we have reference systems constituted by a set of points at rest
or essentially by macroscopic objects. Now, it is interesting to perceive that the
Special Relativity (SR) contains two postulates which conceptually exclude each
other in a certain sense, namely:

1) -the equivalence of the inertial reference frames (with v < c) is essentially
due to the fact that we have Galilean reference frames, where v
v = 0, since it is
always possible to introduce a set of points at relative rest and consequently, for this
reason, we can exchange v for

v by symmetry in inverse transformations.

−

2) -the constancy of c, which is unattainable by massive particles and therefore
c could never be related to a set of inﬁnite points at relative rest. In this sense, such
“referential”(c), contrary to the 1st. one, is not Galilean because we have “c
=
0(= c) and, for this reason, we can never exchange c for

c′′

−

c.

−

However, the covariance of a relativistic ether SV places the photon (c) on a
certain condition of equality with the motion of other particles (v < c), in the sense
that we have completely eliminated the classical idea of rest for reference space
(Galilean reference frame) in such quantum space-time. Since we cannot think of
a reference system constituted by a set of inﬁnite points at rest in such quantum
space-time, then we should deﬁne a non-Galilean reference system essentially as a
set of all those particles which have the same state of movement (v) in relation

to the ultra-referential SV of the relativistic ether. Hence, such quantum relativity
with gravity should contain 3 postulates, as follows:

1) -the constancy of the speed of light (c) ;
2) -the non-equivalence (asymmetry) of the non-Galilean reference frames, i.e.,

3) -the covariance of a relativistic ether (ultra-referential SV ) associated to the

minimum limit of speed V forbidden for all the particles .

The three postulates described above are compatible among themselves, in the
sense that we completely eliminate any kind of Galilean reference system in such
space-time structure where gravity becomes coupled to electrodynamics at the quan-
tum level. In other words, this means essentially that gravity cannot couple to elec-
trodynamics in a space-time which includes Galilean reference systems (a classical
space-time of Special Relativity), where the concept of rest just for macroscopic
objects prevail; or else, as we have V
0 (with-
0), so we restore the classic idea of rest (Galilean
out gravity), then V
reference frame) and therefore that symmetry by exchanging v for

v in SR.

Under the Special-Classical Relativity (SCR or SR), there is no ultra-referential
SV , i.e.,V
0; hence, the starting point for observing S′ is the reference system
S at which the classical observer thinks that he is at rest (Galilean reference frame
S).

→

Under the Special-Quantum Relativity (SQR), the starting point for obtaining
the true movement of all particles in S′ is the ultra-referential SV (see Fig.1);
however, due to non-locality of SV and for being unattainable by the particles at
local level, the existence of an observer (local level) in it (SV ) becomes inconceivable.
Hence, let us think of a non-Galilean referential S0 in a certain intermediate speed
mode (V << v0 << c) in order to represent the new starting point (local level)
for observing the movement of S′ through SV . In such referential S0 for v0, which
plays the similar role of a “rest”, we must restore all the newtonian parameters of
particles such as the proper time interval ∆t0, i.e., ∆t(v = v0)=∆t0; the mass m0;
i.e. m(v = v0) = m0, among others. Therefore, in this sense, S0 plays a role that
is similar to the referential S under SR where ∆t(v = 0) = ∆t0, m(v = 0) = m0,
etc; however, here in SQR, the classical relative rest (v = 0) should be replaced
by an universal “quantum rest” v0(
= 0) for the non-galilean referential S0 to be
determined. We will show that v0 is also an universal constant. In sum, S0 is an

universal non-Galilean reference frame for v0 from where the well-known proper
mass (m0) or proper energy E0 = m0c2 of a particle is restored. This means that,
in such referential S0, we get the proper energy E = m0c2 = m0c2Ψ(v0) such that
Ψ(v0) = 1, as well as γ(v = 0) = 1 for the particular case of Lorentz transformations
0. So we will look for the general function Ψ(v) of SQR where we have
where V

By making the non-Galilean referential S (Fig. 1) coincide with such referential

S0, we get the Figure 2.(see f2.eps)

Fig. 2. As S0 is ﬁxed (universal),being v0(>> V ) given for SV , we should also
consider the interval V (SV ) < v
v0. This non-classical regime for v introduces
a new symmetry in the space-time of SQR. Thus we expect that new and inter-
esting results take place:in such interval,we will see that Ψ(v) < 1 (see equation
(60),(72)and Fig.8).

≤

In general, we should have the interval V < v < c for S′. In sum, we say that
both SV and S0 are already ﬁxed or universal while S′ is a rolling referential to
describe the variations of the moving state of particles within such interval in ques-
tion. Since the rolling referential S′ is not a Galilean one due to the impossibility to
ﬁnd a set of points at rest on it, so we cannot place the particle exactly on the origin
O′, as there would be a non-localization (an uncertainty) ∆x′ on x′ = 0 (O′) (see
Figure 3). Actually, we want to show that such delocalization ∆x′ (x′ non-located)
is a function which should depend on the speed v of S′ with respect to SV ; namely
for example, if S′
(maximum delocal-
ization or uncertainty), which is due to the non-local aspect of the ultra-referential
SV . On the other hand, if S′
0 (better located
on O′). Thus let us search for a function ∆x′ = ∆x′(v) = ∆x′v, starting from the

At the referential S′ in Fig. 3, let us consider that a photon is emitted from
a point A at y′, in the direction AO′, which occurs only if S′ were Galilean (at
rest on itself); however,since the electron cannot be thought of as a point at rest
on its proper non-Galilean referential S′,and cannot be located exactly on O′,then
its delocalization O′C (= ∆x′v)(see Fig.3) causes the photon to deviate from the
direction AO′ to AC. Hence, instead of simply the segment AO′,a rectangle triangle
AO′C is formed at the proper non-Galilean referential S′ where it is not possible
to ﬁnd a set of points at rest.

From the referential S0 (“quantum rest”), which plays the role of S, from where
one “observes” the movement of S′ through SV , we see the trajectory AB for the
photon; hence the rectangle triangle AO′B is formed. Since the vertical leg AO′ is
common to the triangles AO′C (S′) and AO′B (S0 ≡

If ∆x′(v) = ∆x′v = 0, we fall back to the classical case (SR), where we consider, for
example, a train wagon (S′) which is moving in relation to a ﬁxed rail (S). At a
point A on the ceiling of the wagon, there is a laser which releases photons toward
y′, which reach the point O′ assumed in the origin (on the ﬂoor). To Galilean- S′,
the trajectory of the photon is AO′. To Galilean- S, its trajectory is AB.

Since ∆x′v is a function of v,being a kind of displacement given on the proper

non-Galilean reference frame S′,we may write it in the following way:

(∆x′v) = f (v)∆τ,

(47)

where f (v) is a function of v, which also presents dimension of velocity, i.e.,it is
a certain velocity in SQR which could be thought as if it were a kind of internal
motion vint of the particle,being responsable for the internal dimension increasing
(dilatation,stretch) of the own particle on its proper non-Galilean referential.Such
proper dilatation is given by the non-classical (internal)displacement ∆x′v = O′C
(see Fig.3).This leads us to think that there is an uncertainty of position for the
particle,as we will see later. Hence, substituting (47) in (46), we will obtain:

In sum, from (i) and (ii), we observe that, if v

fmax = (vint)max = c. So now we
perceive that the internal motion vint (= f (v)) works like a reciprocal speed (vRec)
in such symmetrical structure of space-time in SQR. In other words, we can say
that, when the (external) velocity v increases to c, the internal one (vint = vRec)
decreases to V .On the other hand,when v tends to V (SV ),vint tends to c,leading
to a large displacement (uncertainty) ∆x′v due to a non-locality behavior closer to
ultra-referential SV . Due to such fact, we reason that

where a is a constant that has dimension of squared speed. Such internal or recip-
rocal velocity vRec will be better understood later. It is interesting to know that a
similar idea of considering an internal motion for microparticles was also thought
by Natarajan in his alternative uniﬁed model for SR and Quantum Mechanics(see
reference [36]).

In addition to (48) and (49),we already know that, at the referential S0 (see
Figs.2 and 3),we should have the condition of equality of the time intervals; that is,
∆t = ∆τ for v = v0, which, in accordance with (48), occurs only if

According to (52) and also considering (i) and (ii), we observe respectively that

0/V (c is the

f (c) = V = v2
reciprocal velocity of V ), from which we immediately obtain

v0 = √cV

As we already know the value of V (refer to (43)) and of c, we obtain the velocity
4m/s, which is universal because it depends on
of “quantum rest” v0 ∼= 5, 65
the universal constants c and V . However we must stress that only c and V remain
invariant under velocity transformations in such space-time (see Complement 7.1).

However, we will perceive elsewhere that we can also describe such space-time in
a compact form as being eﬀectively a 4-dimensional structure, since V ∆τ and c∆t

because V ∆τ appears as an implicit variable in the space-time interval c∆τ (see

become forbidden for all massive particles.

The speed v = c is represented by the photon (particle without mass), while
v = V is deﬁnitely forbidden for any particle; that is, in a general manner, we have
c. But, in this sense, we have a certain asymmetry as there is no particle
V < v
in the ultra-referential SV , where there should be a kind of sui generis vacuum
energy density (ρ(2)) to be studied in details in a future article.

let us assume the world line of a particle limited by the surfaces of two cones, as
shown in the Figure 5.(see f5.eps)

forbidden boundary in this cone representation of temporal speed vt. On the other
hand, v = c (photon) is represented by the solid line of Figure 5, which corresponds
to the temporal speed vt = 0 in this Figure. In sum, we always have v2 + v2

being v for spatial (light) cone (Figure 5) and vt for temporal cone represented in

In SQR, we must observe that a particle which moves in one dimension always
goes to left or right only, since the unattainable minimum limit of speed V for-
bids it to stop and come back on this same dimension of space, in a similar way
for c which forbids to stop the time,i.e.,vt = 0 (see Fig.6),and also to come back
in it. However,if we consider more than one spatial dimension, at least 2 spatial
dimensions(xy)(see Fig.5), the particle can now return by moving through the ad-
ditional dimension(s).So SQR provides the reason why we must have more than
one(1) spatial dimension(d > 1) for representing movement in Reality, although we
can consider 1d as a good approximation for some cases in classical space-time of
SR (classical objects).

In Figure 5, we notice two boundaries in such space-time (c and V ) while in Fig.

it is important to observe that, upon transposing the 2nd. term from the right-

The chart given in Figure 7 shows us those four representations.(see f7.eps)

Fig. 7. The spatial representations in a1 (also shown in Figure 5) and b1 are
related respectively to velocity v (momentum) and position (delocalization ∆x′v =
f (v)∆τ = vint∆τ = vRec∆τ = (v2

quantities in space. On the other hand, the temporal representations in a2 (also

quantities with accuracy. And for this reason, as a classical observer (local and
macroscopic) is always at rest (v = 0) in his proper reference frame, he measures
and interprets E without accuracy because his referential is Galilean,being related
essentially to macroscopic systems (a set of points at rest), while, on the other hand,
non-Galilean reference frames for representing subatomic world in SQR are really
always moving for any transformation in such quantum space-time and therefore
cannot be related to a set of points at rest. Due to this conceptual discrepancy between
the nature of non-Galilean reference frames in SQR (no rest) and the nature of
Galilean reference frames in SR for classical observes (with rest), the actual energy
E in SQR (eq.(72)) behaves as an uncertainty ∆E for such classical observes at
∆E (in any Galilean-S at rest), similarly also P behaves as

The present work has proposed a simple model where a gravitational ﬁeld couples
to the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a charged particle. The existence of a ﬁne coupling
24) leads to a positive increment of density of electromagnetic energy in the
(ξ
space around the charged particle. Thereupon, a certain density of coupling energy
appears, which does not depend on the distance to the particle (ρ(2)
1/r0). Such
constant density is related to a residual and non-local energy which is inherent to
the space (a type of vacuum energy), constituting a special state of “matter” (a
sui-generis energy). Such special state is associated to a privileged background ﬁeld
reference frame which we denominate ultra-referential SV and that corresponds to

a minimum universal speed V that is unattainable by the particles. It is a kind of
relativistic “ether”, in accordance with a few non-conventional ideas of Einstein.
Its existence does not violate the covariance of the Maxwell wave equations (see
Complement 7.2).

We have introduced a space-time with symmetry, so that V < v

c, where V
is a deﬁnitely forbidden boundary (an inferior limit of speed). Such symmetry has
introduced a space-temporal elasticity, e.g.,temporal dilatation or spatial contraction
for v
c and also the new eﬀect of temporal contraction or spatial dilatation
V , in such a way that it enabled one to understand the symmetries

The present theory has various implications which shall be investigated in com-
ing articles. A new group that is more general than Lorentz group will be needed.
One of the implications has to do with the transformations in space-time for the
ﬁelds F µν from one non-Galilean referential to another. We plan to construct a new
relativistic electrodynamics with vacuum-SV and make important applications of
it. The nature of such vacuum will be better understood.

The other investigation will propose the development of a new more general
relativistic dynamics where the energy of vacuum (ultra-referential SV ) performs a
crucial role for understanding of the problem of the inertia (the problem of mass
anisotropy). We shall obtain a simple equation which will allow us to calculate the
vacuum energy for a given spatial volume and understand its unique nature.

The sui-generis nature of such vacuum energy of the ultra-referential SV shall be
further understood in more details in another article, where we will intend to study
its implications on General Relativity (GR) and Cosmology. We shall establish
a connection between the cosmologic constant (Λ) as a cosmological scalar ﬁeld
and the cosmologic antigravity through the relativistic-ether SV (vacuum energy),
which leads to the preparation of a new energy-impulse tensor (T µν) for matter
in the presence of such sui generis vacuum energy (see Complement 7.3). Hence,
in another paper, we will estimate the very low value of the current cosmologic
2), which is still not well understood by the quantum ﬁeld
constant (Λ
theories for quantum vacuum, because such theories foresee a very high value for
Λ, while supersymmetric theories foresee an exact null value for it.

Let us assume the referential S′ with a speed v (= vˆx) in relation to the ultra-
referential SV . To simplify,consider here a hipothetical motion in only one spatial
dimension. Due to the extension of the present research, we will limit ourselves

V ′′ = V . Let us
v′ = v = V in (84). Thus, in this instance, we obtain vRel = “V

7.3. Preparation of a energy-momentum tensor in the presence of

vacuum energy for ultra-referential-SV

We intend to build a new energy-momentum tensor T µν which must preserve the
form of the old one in order to satisfy the Pascal Law; however, instead such new
tensor becomes diagonalized for v = 0 (a ﬂuid in equilibrium with the same pressure
p in all directions), now it must be diagonalized just for v = V , since the ultra-
referential SV represents the universal ﬂuid in equilibrium which ﬁll out all space-
time and lead to a negative pressure we intend to show. To do this, let us write the
eﬀective 4-velocity of SQR, as follow:

where µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 and α = 1, 2, 3. The properties of the new U µ will be better
understood in a next paper. If V

0, we recover 4-velocity of SR.

As we always must have T 00 = W > 0, thus we get p < 0 above, which implies
in a negative pressure for vacuum energy density of the ultra-referential SV . So we
verify that a negative pressure emerges naturally from such new and general tensor,
which does not occur in the old tensor where we need to suppose the condition p =

since there is no vacuum energy in GR. Actually, for this reason, we will need to look

Such GQR naturally includes a cosmological constant Λ as an eﬀect of vacuum-

We can obtain T µν

vacuum = lim.v

V T µν =

vac. is in fact a diagonalized tensor as we
where we naturally conclude that ǫ =
hope to be. So vacuum-SV (relativistic “ether”) of such space-time is a sui-generis
ﬂuid in equilibrium and with negative pressure, leading to a cosmological antigravity.

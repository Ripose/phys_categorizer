interpretation of nature of time arrow is made on the base of multifractal theory of time and space
presented at works [5]- [19]. In this paper shown possibility to walk to and fro in space and necessity
of huge amount of energy for stopping time and changing direction of it in microscopic volumes.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. UNIVERSE AS TIME AND SPACE WITH
FRACTIONAL DIMENSIONS

As is well known the time ﬂows in our world only in
future (arrow of time of Eddington [1] and Prigogin [2])
and now nobody knows is it possible to change direction
of the time ﬂow or is it impossible and why if it is pos-
sible or impossible. The problems of arrow of time are
very intrigues and many of physicians presented interest-
ing models of it phenomenon (see for example [3], or new
interesting experiments [4] . For analyzing this problem
it is necessary to investigate the models of time in which
the time is not simple time axes, but has complicated
structure. The purpose of this paper is to investigate
problem of time arrow in the multifractal model of time
presented in fractal model of space and time at [5]- [19].
In this model the time and the space are real material
ﬁelds with fractional dimensions and multifractal struc-
ture (multyfractal sets) deﬁned on sets of their carriers of
measure. In every time (or space) points the dimensions
of time (or space) determine densities of Lagrangians en-
ergy for all known physical ﬁelds ( or Lagrangian of new
physical ﬁelds for space dimensions) in these points. This
model allows understand reason of existence of the arrow
of time: this reason has pure energetically nature and
consists in necessity to use huge amount of energy for
changing of direction of time.

In this paragraph we summary the main results of the
fractal theory of time and space [5]- [19]. In this theory,
when Universe was born ( the moment of ”big bang”)
from vacuum (in this theory Universe was born from
the set of carrier of measure which plays role of phys-
ical vacuum) only material ﬁelds were born (or appear
on surface of carrier of measure-vacuum): the time and
the space ﬁelds with fractional dimensions. So our Uni-
verse are real ﬁelds of time and space and not conclude
something yet. Fractional dimensions of time and space
are appearing in our world as physical ﬁelds (all physical
ﬁelds, known and new ﬁelds that will be ﬁnd, are char-
acteristics of time with fractional dimensions). When
temperature of Universe (i.e. the temperature of ﬁelds
of time and space) was changing, fractional dimensions
was changing too and new physical ﬁelds were appear-
ing in accordance with known theory of ”big bang” and
broken symmetry ( depending at Universe temperature).
The equations for physical ﬁelds appear as consequences
of principle of fractal dimensions functional (FDF) mini-
mum . These equations are Euler equations with general-
ized fractional Riemann-Liouville derivatives (the gener-
alization consists in propagating the Riemann-Liouville
derivatives on domain of multifractal sets where frac-
tional dimensions are functions of time and coordinates)
. For case of integer dimensions these derivatives and
equations coincide with ordinary derivatives and the the-
ory in whole coincides with known physical theories. So

1

only diﬀerence of the theory [5]- [19] from known theories
consists in using the algorithm for propagating modern
theories on the domain of the Universe with fractional
dimensions of time and space and geometrization of all
physical ﬁelds in frame of fractal geometry of world. In
cited works many equations of modern physics were re-
It was shown that
searched in fractal space and time.
in multifractal model all physical ﬁelds are geometriza-
tioned. It diﬀers this theory positively from general rel-
ativity theory (the latter is a special case of multifractal
theory of time and space in special selection of measure
carrier and integer dimensions (see [13]) ) where only one
ﬁeld (gravitation ﬁeld) is geometrizationed.
In the world of fractional dimensions there are many new
special physical characteristics and peculiarities. The
main of them are:
a) in the world with fractal dimensions there are no con-
stant physical values because fractional derivative with
respect to constant value is not zero. So all physical
values are changing in time and in space ( for example,
electric charge of electron has changed from the time of
big bang as δe = eε/t where t = t0 + δt and δt is current
time, t0 -is the time of existence of Universe). Conse-
quences of it are absence in this world any rigorous laws
of preservation (they are fulﬁlled only as very good ap-
proach, but not as rigorously laws);
b) there are no inertial systems in Universe because there
are no constant velocities and special Einstein theory
must be replaced by theory of almost inertial systems
(it coincide with special relativity theory on the surface
of Earth till velocities v = c − δv, δv ∼ 100msec−1; On
the surface of Earth the fractional dimensions of time dif-
fers from unity on value ∼ 10−9.
c) all systems of reference are absolute systems (time
and space are non homogeneous and non isotropic). So
Michelson experiments had proved independence of speed
of light at moving of origin of light are only very good
approach ( on the surface of Earth the changing of direc-
tion v on −v in the fractal world gives change of speed
of light on value ∼ 0.1cmsec−1 );
d) in the fractal world velocities of moving bodies may
be equal speed of light in vacuum (there are no singular-
ity at v = c) or exceed it and it is possible to propagate
information with any wished velocities;
e) there are no singularities in the theory because for
V (r) ∼ ∞ (V is a potential of any ﬁelds) all fractional
diﬀerential operators of the theory turns into fractional
integrals;
f) all physical (i.e. Newton ,Shr¨odinger, Maxwell, Dirac,
Einstein and so on ) equations of modern physics are ir-
reversible;
g) the laws of thermodynamics are consequences of mul-
tifractal structure of Universe for its domain with state
near thermodynamics equilibrium;
h) the theory predicts existence of new ﬁelds originated
by fractional dimensions of space ;
i) the theory predicts existence of new physics in the do-
main of superluminal velocities in vacuum for ordinary

(not taxions) particles with new eﬀects that may be ex-
perimentally discovered;
j) in the fractal world the time has inertial characteris-
tics described by mr in analogy with well known Newton
mass mt and equations for t(r) are exist (analogies of
Newton, Dirac and so on equations) ;
k) the theory have two masses: masses mt as measure
of inertia for moving in the time(Newton masses) and
masses mr as measure of inertia for moving time in
space (masses concerned with inhomogeneous time in the
space);
l) the presented theory is a natural generalization of all
modern physical theories for domains of time and space
with fractional dimensions and coincide with any of them
in the case when fractional parts of dimensions are zero.
This theory is not the variant of theories of quantum time
and quantum space, because the multifractal ”intervals”
of space and time had used in the theory (the time and
the space are consist of them) are very composed multi-
fractal sets and researching its structure lay in f uture.
The question about irriversibility of time (the arrow of
time) in the theory of fractal time and space ( [5]- [16])
was not researched. This paper has purpose to investi-
gate why the time has only one direction in our world on
the base of the multifractal theory of time and space [5]-
[19].

III. WHY TIME HAS DIRECTION ONLY TO
FUTURE AND WHY IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK IN
TIME TO AND FRO?

In the theory of fractal time and space the problem of
existing in Universe the arrow of time may be considered
(we show it below) as the problem of decreasing of the
energy for the states when the time arrow has direction to
future. We will show that in the domain of multifractal
Universe with time dimensions less than unit and when
the fractional parts of time dimensions are small addi-
tions (with negative signs) to unit , the arrow of time
with direction to future gives decreasing of energy for
any body in this domain of Universe. So the arrow of
time gives spontaneous decreasing (diminishing) of Uni-
verse energy in these domains (and in Universe on the
whole).
For demonstrating it let us write the quantum equations
for model particle with a rest mass m and momentum
p = 0 for two cases: in the time space with integer di-
mensions and in the time space with fractional dimen-
sions

(2)

In (2) we used generalized fractional derivative Ddt
+,t de-
ﬁned as (see [5]- [19]). Following these works we consider

2

both time and space as the initial real material ﬁelds ex-
isting in the world and generating all other physical ﬁelds
by means of their fractal dimensions. Assume that every
of them consists of a continuous, but not diﬀerentiable
bounded set of small intervals (these intervals further
treated as ”points”). Consider the set of small time in-
tervals St (their sizes may be evaluated in rude approach
as Planck sizes). Let time be deﬁned on multifractal
subsets of such intervals, deﬁned on certain measure car-
rier RN . Each interval of these subsets (or ”points”) is
characterized by the fractional (fractal) dimension (FD)
dt(r(t), t) and for diﬀerent intervals FD are diﬀerent. In
this case the classical mathematical calculus or fractional
(say, Riemann - Liouville) calculus [22] can not be applied
to describe a small changes of a continuous function of
physical values f (t), deﬁned on time subsets St, because
the fractional exponent depends on the coordinates and
time. Therefore, we have to introduce integral function-
als (both left-sided and right-sided) which are suitable to
describe the dynamics of functions deﬁned on multifrac-
tal sets (see [5]- [7]). Actually, these functionals are sim-
ple and natural generalization of the Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivatives and integrals:

where Γ(x) is Euler’s gamma function, and a and b are
some constants from [0, ∞). In these deﬁnitions, as usu-
ally, n = {d} + 1 , where {d} is the integer part of d if
d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤ d < n) and n = 0 for d < 0.
If
d = const, the generalized fractional derivatives (GFD)
(1)-(2) coincide with the Riemann - Liouville fractional
derivatives (d ≥ 0) or fractional integrals (d < 0). When
d = n+ε(t), ε(t) → 0, GFD can be represented by means
of integer derivatives and integrals. For n = 1, that is,
d = 1 + ε, |ε| << 1 it is possible to obtain:

where a is a constant and determined by choice of the
rules of regularization of integrals ( [5])-( [6]), ( [11]) (for
more detailed see [11]) and the last addendum in the
right hand side of (5) is very small. The selection of
the rule of regularization that gives a real additives for
usual derivative in (3) yield a = 0.5 for d < 1 [5]. The
functions under integral sign in (3)-(4) we consider as
the generalized functions deﬁned on the set of the ﬁnite
functions [23]. The notions of GFD, similar to (3)-(4),
can also be deﬁned and for the space variables r. The

deﬁnitions of GFD (3)-(4) needs in connections between
fractal dimensions of time dt(r(t), t) and characteristics
of physical ﬁelds (say, potentials Φi(r(t), t), i = 1, 2, ..) or
densities of Lagrangians Li) and it was deﬁned in cited
works. Following [5]- [19], we deﬁne this connection by
the relation

dt(r(t), t) = 1 +

βiLi(Φi(r(t), t))

(6)

Xi

i in the form β′

where Li are densities of energy of physical ﬁelds, βi are
dimensional constants with physical dimension of [Li]−1
(it is worth to choose β′
i = a−1βi for the
sake of independence from regularization constant). The
deﬁnition of time as the system of subsets and deﬁnition
of the FD for dt (see ( 4)) connects the value of fractional
(fractal) dimension dt(r(t), t) with each time instant t.
The latter depends both on time t and coordinates r. If
dt = 1 (an absence of physical ﬁelds) the set of time has
topological dimension equal to unity. The multifractal
model of time allows ( as was shown [9]) to consider the
divergence of energy of masses moving with speed of light
in the SR theory as the result of the requirement of rig-
orous validity of the laws pointed out in the beginning of
this paper in the presence of physical ﬁelds (in the mul-
tifractal theory there are only approximate fulﬁllment of
these laws). We bound consideration only the case when
relation dt = 1 − ε(r(t), t)), |ε| ≪ 1 are fulﬁlled. In that
case the GFD may be represented (as a good approach)
by ordinary derivatives and relation (5) are valid. So the
equation (2) reeds

This equation describes behavior of the particle with
point sizes in time and space (we remind that it is only
the approach that we use and in reality minimal size of
time intervals and minimal sizes of space intervals in the
theory are bound, for example, by Planck sizes, thou the
last are multifractal sets too) For free ( more rightly al-
most free) particle choose solution for ψ as a plane wave
with energy depending of time (ψ = ψ0 exp
) and
for domain of time-space where by members with ∂ε

The equations (10) - (11) allow to conclude that the frac-
tal dimensions time leads to the two sorts of phenomena:
a) decreasing of energy with time ﬂow on value ε¯ht−1; b)
spread (run) of wave function on value t−ε ∼ (1 − ε ln t).
Thus when time t (or current time (t − t0)) is increasing
(t0 is age of Universe) both energy and wave function are
decreasing. Evaluation of both decreasing values (if take
into account only gravitation ﬁeld on surface of Earth and
take into account that ε ∼ 10−7, t ∼ t0 ∼ 1017) gives:
△E = ¯hεt−2
0 ∼ 10−56ev for one second of current time .
We pay attention that so little value of damping energy
follows from the points model for describing the particle
(the particle consists are of one ”interval” of time and of
one ”interval” of space, described above). For more re-
alistic model it is necessary to take into account a really
sizes of particles ( partly the energy of damping will be
evaluates in next paragraph). Rigorously say we made
evaluation of the lose energy in the point of space where
point particle presents because the fractional dimensions
that are sources of the real particle mass may be so large
that approach ε << 1 is not work.

IV. IS IT POSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE
DIRECTION OF TIME AND HOW MUCH
ENERGY IT NEEDS ?

In this paragraph we research the question: may the
time be turned in back direction? The energies needs for
is possible to evaluate if use rude approach . The ex-
ample for behavior of the free model particle has demon-
strated the damping of energy in Universe with fractional
time dimensions ( the case of decreasing energy as con-
sequences of existence of fractional dimensions of space
is analogies). Thus the question why the time has only
one direction towards future has natural answer:
it is
because only in that direction of time the energy of par-
ticles ( or any bodies consisting of particles) decrease.
If somebody wants to change the direction of time it is
necessary to spend energy for changing structure of real
ﬁelds of time and space. On the ﬁrst look this energy
is very small (see above paragraph), but its smallness
is related with the case when multifractal ”intervals” of
time and space (△t and △r) were treated as ”points”
with fractional (global for sets consisting the time ﬁeld)
dimensions and equation (11) describes the lose energy
only of such points ”intervals”. What are values of time
and space ”intervals ” in our Universe? The theory of
fractal time and space in her present state can not an-
swer on this question. So we use some hypotheses about
their values. As the rude approach we may take for its
values Planck sizes:△t ∼ 10−44sec and △x ∼ 10−33cm .
Then one second consists of 1044 of ”intervals” of time
and one centimeter consists of 1033 ”intervals” of space (
we needs to remember that every of ”intervals” is multi-

(11)

fractal sets with very composed characteristics which do
not researched in present work (see [9]). For current time
(t − t0) the relation for lose energy by the domain space
with volume ∼ 10−42cm3 during one second ( the volume
of elementary particles) reads

△E ∼

104410−421099 ∼ 1045ev

(12)

ε¯h
t2
0

If such gigantic energy will be received by time ﬁeld with
space volume 10−42cm3sec the ﬂow of time during one
second be stopped and if double this energy during one
second the time ﬂow change its direction (i.e. t → −t)
and time will ﬂow one second in back direction). Thus
the direction of time in our Universe may be changed but
it needs in the gigantic amount of energy. Of course, the
value of this energy depends at the evaluation of the ”in-
tervals” of time and space values and if last values more
than Planck intervals (for example at 105 − 1010) the en-
ergy will be smaller but also huge. Result is: in principle
the inversion of direction of time may be reached but it
is impossible on the modern state of humankind tech-
nology even for microscopic volumes. If values of time
and space intervals needs in corrections, the evaluation
of energy needs for inversion of time direction must be
corrected too.

V. HOW MUCH ENERGY NEEDS FOR
STOPPING THE TIME AND MOVING IT BACK
IN THE VOLUME OF ONE CUBIC
CENTIMETER DURING ONE SECOND?

In the multifractal fractal theory of time and space
where time and space ﬁelds are real themselves and are
real origin of all physical ﬁelds in principle (it was shown
in above paragraph) there are possibilities to inverse the
time ﬂow in back direction. Now we write the equation
for changing with time of one Planck interval of space xp
and see how the energy of it (as a part of real space ﬁeld
it has energy of rest which damping with ﬂow of time)
changes in time (let this Planck volume is in rest, i.e.
p = 0)

The solution of (14) may be represented as

i¯hDdt

+,txp = E0xp

xp = E0xp − i¯h

(15)

(16)

or

where

Now evaluate the volume xp using Planck interval and
use earlier values of ε, t0, ¯h. If connection binding every
element r with element t has the form dr2 − dt2 = 0 and
for each element of space spending energy each element
of time spend energy too, thus for the energy lose of space
volume equal one cm3 during one second write

△E ∼

109910441012ev ∼ 10−6810155ev ∼ 1087ev (17)

ε
t2
0

So we got the order of values of energy needs for stop-
ping the time in the cm3sec. For inversion of time ﬂow
in this volume needs double this value of energy. For
stopping time in the volume of one elementary particle
necessary multiply above value at 10−42 (if size of parti-
cle ∼ 10−14cm). It gives △E ∼ 1045ev. Nobody knows
is it possible in far future to receive such energies and
concentrate them in small volumes.

VI. WHY WE CAN WALK TO AND FRO IN OUR
SPACE

Why we can not walk to and fro in time had been ex-
plained in the frame of multifractal time in paragraph
above on the language of energetically reasons. The pos-
sibility of walking to and fro in space is conditioned by
vector characteristics of fractional addendum to space
derivatives in multifractal Universe. For simplicity we
consider non relativistic case when particle is described
by Shr¨odinger equation in multifractal space (see [5], [6],
[16]) . Let multifractional addendum to integer space di-
mensions εi is very small (|εi| << 1). Than for GFD we
can right (we conserve only main addendum necessary
for our purpose)

D1−εr

+,r ∼ (

Now replace fractional space derivatives by means of (13)

tion )

If in the (20) we replace r by −r the sign of fractal ad-
dendum from fractional space dimensions do not change
its sign, so there are no energetically reasons forbidding
walking to and fro in the fractal Universe. Of course,
in the equation (15) omitted the members describing the
lose of energy by particle reasoned by the fractional struc-
ture of space. We do not evaluate the energy lose rea-
soned by multifractal structure of space because in this

case the evaluation is very diﬃcult ( the value of εr is
unknown). It value deﬁned by new ﬁelds (not discovered
yet) that borne by fractional space dimensions (see [5],
[6], [7].

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The arrow of time in considered model of multifractal
time and space as was seen above is consequence of en-
ergetically reasons. Direction of time may be changed
(thou only in principle in our epoch because of huge
amount of energy that needs for it). There are three
main results of this article: a) the explanation of nature
of arrow of time by natural lose of energy of our Universe
and by necessity for energy compensation of this lose for
changing of direction of time in any domain (small or
large) of space and time; b) it is point out at the huge
amount of energy in every bodies and ﬁelds ( more de-
tailed consideration will be in special paper ) caused by
the real nature of ﬁelds of time and space ; c) the principle
possibility to change directions of time and space ﬁelds
in the remote future epoch. We considered the energy
needs for changing direction of time, thou it is necessary
to return the space in earlier state too.
Some general remarks . Any fractal or multifractal sets
(Universe is multifractal set) always not belong and not
coincide with measure of carrier on that they are deﬁned
(it include the cases when measure of carrier is multi-
fractal set itself and not space RN type ).
If describe
the measure carrier of our Universe in terms of ”physical
vacuum”, then ”vacuum” do not belongs to our Universe.
Main part of it lays out of Universe (see also [3]) . The
Universe may be treated as a gigantic energetic ﬂuctua-
tion (”metastable” long living ﬂuctuation) in the measure
of carrier and as the ﬂuctuation it has strong binding with
its ”mother” . The existence of strong binding with the
vacuum (measure of carrier) consist in continual trans-
ferring to vacuum the huge amount of energy that was
got from vacuum in the moment of ”big bang” (or in
the moment of birth in any over scenario) as was demon-
strated in this paper. What future wait our Universe in
the model of multifractal space and time ? Universe will
spend her supply of energy that was got from vacuum in
the moment of big bang. When all energy supply be spent
process of Universe dying will be ﬁnished till time when
new Universe borne from measure of carrier (vacuum). In
this model many of universes (may be inﬁnity) may exis-
tent because measure of carrier can give birth any huge
amount of Universes (with their own times and spaces
that can diﬀerent at our time and space by it dimensions
and energetical characteristics) and die of one of them is
not essential for carrier of measure in this model of multi
Universes structure of ”vacuum ” not belonging to our
Universe. How name this world of inﬁnity of Universes
where birth and die of inﬁnity of Universes change one
another ? May be ”perpetual universes eternity model”

Electromagnetics from a quasistatic perspective

(Received textdate; Revised textdate; Accepted textdate)

Quasistatics is introduced so that it ﬁts smoothly into the standard textbook presentation of elec-
trodynamics. The usual path from statics to general electrodynamics is rather short and surprisingly
simple. A closer look reveals however that it is not without confusing issues as has been illustrated
by many contributions to this Journal. Quasistatic theory is conceptually useful by providing an
intermediate level in between statics and the full set of Maxwell’s equations. Quasistatics is easier
than general electrodynamics and in some ways more similar to statics. It is however, in terms of
interesting physics and important applications, far richer than statics. Quasistatics is much used
in electromagnetic modeling, an activity that today is possible on a PC and which also has great
pedagogical potential. The use of electromagnetic simulations in teaching gives additional support
for the importance of quasistatics. This activity may also motivate some change of focus in the
presentation of basic electrodynamics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Applications of electrodynamics may be in the static,
quasistatic or general high frequency regime. Quasistat-
ics is more or less neglected in most textbooks and the
purpose of this paper is to present material that can ﬁll
this gap in a course on the level of for example Griﬃth’s
textbook.1 There are good reasons to do so including:

1. The step from statics to general electrodynamics is
huge in terms of its physical content. Quasistatic
models are useful by providing intermediate levels
in the theory. Thereby several confusing issues that
result from the very condensed standard deriva-
tion of Maxwell’s equations may be avoided. Ques-
tions concerning Coulomb’s and Biot-Savart’s laws
in non-static situations should be addressed.2,3,4
So should also the appearance of dynamic electric
ﬁelds in regions where the magnetic ﬁeld seems to
be absent (like outside a long solenoid or toroidal
coil with a time-varying current).5,6,7,8,9 Another
confusing issue follows from the standard textbook
motivation for the displacement current where it is
introduced in order to make the equations of elec-
trodynamics consistent with charge conservation.
The physical impact of this term is remarkable and
includes in particular electromagnetic waves in free
space. But why should waves in free space without
charges and currents follow from charge conserva-
tion?10 Quasistatics is useful in the discussion of
these and many other questions.

2. There are plenty of interesting phenomena within
the quasistatic regime. Using the full set of
Maxwell’s equations are many times unnecessarily
complicated since these equations can describe the
most intricate electromagnetic wave phenomena in-
volving short time-scales or high frequency. Such
an analysis may be diﬃcult and is not necessary in
quasistatic situations.11

3. Many real world applications involve the numeri-

cal solution of the time-dependent Maxwell equa-
tions in three dimensions. However, quite often one
is interested in phenomena where some quasistatic
analysis is suﬃcient. This amounts to the replace-
ment of an hyperbolic model with an elliptic (or
parabolic) one which can be solved in more eco-
nomic ways.12,13,14

4. Basic quasistatic theory may be introduced in an el-
ementary and simple way suitable for basic courses
in electrodynamics. Like static theory also qua-
sistatics may be given two equivalent formula-
tions. The ﬁrst is in terms of force laws, includ-
ing straightforward generalizations of the static
Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws. The second for-
mulation is in terms of simple approximations in
Maxwell’s diﬀerential equations.

This paper is organized as follows. Basic theory of
quasistatics is presented in Section II. Subsections A and
B contain the two equivalent formulations of quasistat-
ics, one in terms of force laws and the other in terms
of approximations in Maxwell’s diﬀerential equations. A
salient feature of quasistatics is instantaneous interac-
In subsection C the corresponding
tion at a distance.
c
limit of general electrodynamics is used to derive
quasistatics. Subsections D, E and F include quasistatic
theory for the electromagnetic potentials, the ﬁelds from
a moving point charge and the quasistatic Poynting the-
orems. Alternatives to the standard textbook derivation
of Maxwell’s equations are discussed in Section III from
a quasistatic perspective.

→ ∞

Sections IV and V concern some confusing issues that
have been discussed in many contributions to this Jour-
nal. In Section IV we consider the laws of Coulomb and
Biot-Savart within general time-dependent theory.2 Suf-
ﬁcient and necessary conditions for the exact validity of
these laws are given. Section V contains comments on
the old question #6 of this Journal which concerns the
ﬁelds outside a solenoid with a time-varying current.5

Quasistatics is useful not only for providing improved
understanding of basic theory but it is also important

for applications, in particular for numerical simulations.
In Section VI we discuss the possibility of using elec-
tromagnetic simulations in basic courses and exemplify
with quasistatic equations for eddy currents. A couple of
PDE-solvers which have been used for electromagnetic
modeling on a PC is mentioned. A summary is given in
Section VII.

II. QUASISTATICS

Quasistatics within electrodynamics refers to a regime
where ”the system is small compared with the electro-
magnetic wavelength associated with the dominant time-
scale of the problem”.15 The ﬁelds are then propagated
instantaneously so we are dealing with a kind of c
→ ∞
limit. We consider in this paper three major quasistatic
models. These are EQS (electroquasistatics)11, MQS
(magnetoquasistatics)11 and the Darwin model12,13,14.
EQS includes capacitive but not inductive eﬀects, MQS
includes inductive but not capacitive eﬀects while the
Darwin model includes both capacitive and inductive ef-
fects. The Biot-Savart law is valid in all three models
while the Coulomb law is valid only in EQS. In MQS
and Darwin there is also, besides the Coulomb ﬁeld, an
additional contribution to the electric ﬁeld due to mag-
netic induction. The source of this electric ﬁeld is thus
∂B/∂t in Faraday’s law.16

A. From the laws of Coulomb, Biot-Savart and
Faraday to the EQS, MQS and Darwin models.

Dynamical systems that proceed from one state to an-
other as though they are static (at each ﬁxed time) are
commonly said to be quasistatic. For electromagnetism
the static theory builds on the Coulomb and Biot-Savart
laws together with the static continuity equation. Qua-
sistatics would then simply be obtained by the allowance
for time-dependence in the ﬁrst two otherwise unchanged
laws

The three equations (1), (2) and (4) constitute the EQS
model that includes capacitive but not inductive eﬀects.
Charge may be accumulated in this model but this re-
quire work and energy may as usual be associated with
the electric ﬁeld. Magnetic energy is however outside the
scope of EQS because there is no magnetically induced
electric ﬁeld and accordingly no back emf. No work is
then required to create a magnetic ﬁeld by starting an
electric current.

We now like to include electromagnetic induction.
Then also ∂B/∂t acts as a source of electric ﬁelds and
the total electric ﬁeld becomes the sum of two parts

E = EC +EF

The ﬁrst term is the Coulomb electric ﬁeld

The expressions (6) and (7) are the unique solutions of
(8) and (9) provided appropriate boundary conditions at
inﬁnity are used.20

The Darwin model may be deﬁned by the equations
(2) and (4)-(7). This is a quasistatic model that includes
both capacitive and inductive phenomena. Note that for
given current and charge densities we directly obtain the
electromagnetic ﬁelds in terms of integrals without the
appearance of any time-retardation. Instead the integral
expressions in the laws of Coulomb and Biot-Savart play
an important role in this dynamical model.

The MQS model is obtained from Darwin if the usual

continuity equation is replaced by the static one

J = 0

▽

·

(10)

Thus the MQS model may be deﬁned by the equations
(2), (5), (6), (7) and (10). It is diﬀerent from both EQS
and Darwin by including inductive but not capacitive
eﬀects. A confusing feature of MQS is that the very fun-
damental continuity equation may be violated by MQS-
solutions. Only stationary currents are allowed in MQS

(1)

(2)

(4)

and these cannot explain changes in the charge density,
thus one cannot interpret the currents in MQS in terms of
charge transportation. Of course, only suﬃciently good
approximations of solutions to the Maxwell equations are
interesting in the real world so the continuity equation
must still be almost true in some sense. Amp´ere’s law,
which imply equation (10), is valid in MQS but not in
EQS or Darwin (see the next subsection). Thus Amp´ere’s
law is not always valid in quasistatics. Griﬃths and
Heald remark that ”The application of Amp´ere’s law
in quasistatic situations can be an extremely delicate
matter”.2

The textbook of Haus and Melcher11 builds up an un-
derstanding of electrodynamics by using both EQS and
MQS. This is of particular signiﬁcance in the relation
between electromagnetic ﬁeld theory and circuit theory.
Then EQS involves capacitance features and MQS induc-
tance features. For systems involving capacitance and
inductance both models are needed. For such applica-
tions it is crucial that capacitive and inductive aspects
are not both important in the same spatial place.21 The
use of two complementary quasistatic models in the same
physical system is clearly a complicating feature if we like
to model the whole system numerically. We would then
have to divide the whole spatial region into EQS and
MQS subregions with appropriate continuity conditions
at the interfaces. A better alternative may be to use the
Darwin model which embrace all the physics contained
in EQS and MQS, still being quasistatic.

B. From Maxwell’s equations to EQS, MQS and
Darwin.

Let us now consider the formulation of quasistatics in
terms of diﬀerential equations. The starting point is gen-
eral electrodynamics with the Maxwell equations:

These equations are complete and general as they stand.
However,
in the presence of polarizable/magnetizable
media it is in practice very convenient to write them in
a diﬀerent way by introducing the D- and the H-ﬁelds.
Then only the free charge and current densities appear
explicitly in the equations. For formal simplicity just E-

and B-ﬁelds will be used in the present paper but it is
straightforward to modify the expressions so that a for-
mulation with D- and H-ﬁelds is obtained.

Let us now formulate the quasistatic models EQS,
MQS and Darwin as approximations of Maxwell’s equa-
tions (11)-(14). The relations to the integral formulas
in subsection A above will also be considered. The EQS
model is obtained from the Maxwell equations simply by
neglecting ∂B/∂t in Faraday’s law while MQS is obtained
by instead neglecting ∂E/∂t in the Amp´ere-Maxwell law.
Thus in EQS we have instead of (13) the equation

and in MQS the equation (14) is replaced by the usual
Amp´ere law22

To get the Darwin model we do not neglect all of ∂E/∂t
but keep the Coulomb part of the E-ﬁeld (deﬁned by

Note an important diﬀerence between these two last
equations. The Amp´ere law (16) implies equation (10)
and may violate charge conservation in dynamic situa-
tions. The Amp´ere-Darwin equation, like the Amp´ere-
Maxwell equation, is consistent with the continuity equa-
tion (4).

The electrostatic models may thus be deﬁned with fo-
cus on the laws of Coulomb and Biot-Savart (like in the
previous subsection) or alternatively as approximations
of Maxwell’s equations. These deﬁnitions are summa-
rized in Table I. The proof that the A and B columns
deﬁne the same models involves only standard proce-
dures found in basic textbooks. In electrostatics one start
from the Coulomb law and obtain the divergence and
curl of the electric ﬁeld. By the Helmholtz theorem we
have the equivalence (assuming appropriate conditions at

The above relations trivially remain valid if we allow for

peared in several contributions to this Journal.24,25,26.

states if they are valid within EQS, MQS or Darwin. All
the included equations are familiar from standard electro-
magnetics with the exception of Amp´ere-Darwin’s equa-
tion (17).

C. A limit of instantaneous propagation in
Maxwell’s equations

In subsection A above we obtained the Darwin model
from EQS by including Faraday’s law in a simple and

4

(22)

(23)

(24)

straightforward way. An alternative procedure is to
follow the standard textbook derivation of Maxwell’s
equations1 but in the ﬁnal step, when the displacement
current is added to Amp´ere’s law for consistency with
the continuity equation, ﬁnd the Amp´ere-Darwin equa-
tion (17) rather than the Amp´ere-Maxwell equation (14).
This replaces the usual maximal assumption in the cor-
recting term10 with a kind of minimal assumption. Both
these derivations of Darwin’s model may however seem
rather superﬁcial and arbitrary. It would be nice to obtain
it from Maxwell’s equations by using some more system-
atic method. A basic feature of quasistatic approxima-
tions to Maxwell’s equations is the instantaneous prop-
agation of ﬁelds. Thus it should be possible to consider
quasistatics as some limit c
of Maxwell’s equations.
This is however quite a singular limit and the procedure
must be further speciﬁed. We take the absence of time-
retardation as being the most salient property of qua-
sistatics. Let us express Maxwell’s equations in terms of
the potentials (V, A) so that the retarded time appears
explicitly. We choose to use the Coulomb gauge

→ ∞

and follow the derivation in Nielson and Lewis12 (the rea-
son for not using the Lorentz gauge is considered soon).
The equations for the potentials become (see Griﬃths1
p. 421),

Time-retardation appears explicitly if we solve equation
(24) for the vector potential in terms of an integral in the
usual way. The omission of retarded time in this integral
is the same as excluding the second order time-derivative
so that

The model so obtained consists of the equations (22),

Why didn’t we use the Lorentz gauge? It is straight-
forward to make the corresponding calculations also in
that case. We then get a model approximating Maxwell’s
equations which seems pretty close to the Darwin model
with the Amp´ere-Darwin law as one of the equations.
However, Gauss law (11) is not obtained but a new term

appears in the corresponding equation. Certainly we pre-
fer not to change Gauss law and this problem, as we have
seen, does not appear if we use the Coulomb gauge in the
approximation procedure. Using the Coulomb gauge in
the Darwin model also have the nice consequence that
the Coulomb part of the E-ﬁeld is given by the scalar po-
tential EC =

1. The force between two point charges depends not
only on their separation but also on both their ve-
locities and accelerations

2. Furthermore, it is the position, velocity and accel-
eration at retarded time of the other particle that
matters.

The second point is far more challenging than the
ﬁrst one. However, time-retardation vanishes within qua-
sistatics and the approach with interacting point charges
become quite simple and instructive. In the point charge
approach to electrodynamic models we automatically in-
clude the continuity equation (4). Therefore this section
concerns EQS and Darwin but not MQS. Let us start

It takes some manipulation involving partial integration

E. Fields of a moving point charge

We will now consider the quasistatic ﬁelds from a point
charge in general motion. Coulomb’s law is often taken
as a starting point for electrostatics. It is conceptually
simple to build on interactions between point charges in
this way, so why not develop all of electrodynamics by
generalizing this approach? This is discussed by Griﬃths
(chapter 2).1 Two major problems are

where the notations in (3) are used. The position of Q
is r′ which is a function of time and v = dr′/dt. From
these equations we obtain (1) and (2) while the continuity
equation (4) is implied by the point charge description.
Let us now consider the Darwin model. Then equation
(34) remains valid while (33) only gives the Coulomb part
of the electric ﬁeld

EC (r, t) =

The magnetically induced part EF must now also be in-

The scalar potential (36) is just the Coulomb potential
and the vector potential (37) may be found from (29).
An alternative derivation is by the ansatz

where the scalar ﬁeld φ is determined by the Coulomb
gauge condition (22). It takes a little algebra to ﬁnd

the potentials in the usual way (26). The magnetically
induced part of the electric ﬁeld is

EF =

∂A/∂t

(39)

∇ ×

−
This expression will obviously involve the acceleration
a = dv/dt of Q. The Darwin model should thus follow
from the potentials (36) and (37) of a point charge and
it is suﬃcient to check (2)-(7). Only equation (7) is not
obvious and the easiest approach is to use the equiva-
lent diﬀerential equations (8). But these equations are
trivially satisﬁed by (39) using the Coulomb gauge and
B =

A.

The standard textbook approach to electrostatics be-
gins with Coulomb’s law (33) for a charge at rest. Some-
times the corresponding approach to magnetostatics is
used by taking (34) as a starting point but now, of course,
with a moving charge. This may in principle seem wrong
since this is a time-dependent system. Most textbooks
take this seriously and starts instead from the Biot-Savart
law with stationary current. However, leaving the point
particle point of view also makes magnetostatics more
diﬃcult than electrostatics. It comes as a relief that the
magnetostatic diﬀerential equations (12) and (16) are for-
mally similar to, and not much more diﬃcult than, the
electrostatic equations (11) and (15). Quasistatics is eas-
ier than statics in this respect; it allows for the use of
(34).

A conventional Lagrangian description of the electro-
magnetic interaction between two or more charged par-
ticles is possible only if time-retardation may be ne-
glected. It is straightforward to give such a formulation
constructed from the potentials (36) and (37).30 This re-
sults in the so called Darwin Lagrangian that was ﬁrst
obtained by Oliver Heaviside in 1891.31,32 It was found
again by C.G. Darwin in 1920 by an expansion of the
Lienard-Wiechert potentials.33 Rather surprisingly it
then turns out that that terms up to the order (v/c)2
inclusive are to be kept in the Darwin Lagrangian (see
Jackson15 p.596).

F. The Poynting theorem

Let us follow the standard derivation of Poynting’s the-
orem while using the quasistatic models. I.e. we add the
two equations obtained by taking the scalar product of
the curl E equation with the B-ﬁeld and the scalar prod-
uct of the curl B equation with the E-ﬁeld. We the get

In EQS only the electric ﬁeld is associated with energy.
Building up a magnetic ﬁeld costs no energy in this model
due to the absence of a counteracting induced E-ﬁeld. In
MQS only the magnetic ﬁeld has energy. Changes of the
electric ﬁeld is associated with changes in the charge den-
sity. However, the continuity equation is not satisﬁed and
there is no charge transport for which we could calculate
the required energy. Finally the Darwin model includes
both magnetic and electric energy. Note that only the
Coulomb-part of the E-ﬁeld is associated with energy.
An important qualitative diﬀerence between EQS and
MQS on the one side and Darwin’s model on the other is
the possibility of natural resonances in the latter. Since
Darwin includes both capacitive and inductive features
we may in principle use these equations to model, for ex-
ample, some ﬁeld theoretic manifestation of a LC circuit.

III.
IF MAXWELL HAD WORKED IN
BETWEEN AMP´ERE AND FARADAY

We consider in this section various procedures to ﬁnd
the full set of Maxwell equations starting from the laws of
Coulomb and Biot-Savart. The quasistatic perspective is
useful and the models EQS, MQS and Darwin will appear
as intermediate stages. The title of this section refers to
the possibility of introducing the displacement current
before Farday’s law.34

Let us start with the standard textbook procedure of
ﬁnding Maxwell’s equations.1 From the static laws of
Coulomb and Biot-Savart we ﬁnd, by use of the static
continuity equation, the static limit of Maxwell’s equa-
tions. By introducing magnetic induction we then obtain
MQS (i.e. ”Electrodynamics before Maxwell” in Griﬃths
textbook). The ﬁnal step, motivated by the need for con-
sistency with charge conservation (4), is to introduce the
displacement current. At this point a question mentioned
already in the introduction may surface: Maxwell’s equa-
tions includes waves in free space but why should these
follow from charge conservation? Quasistatics is useful
for discussing this issue.
It is indeed not necessary to
introduce all of the displacement current to save charge
conservation. It is suﬃcient to include the Coulomb part
of it10 and then we get the Darwin model. At this point
no surprising new physics appears. The step from Dar-
win to the Maxwell’s equations may then, to begin with,
be motivated by symmetry and beauty of equations. The
explicit appearance of the Coulomb electric ﬁeld in the
Darwin model is a rather unsatisfactory feature and it
is so easily ﬁxed by just replacing it with the total elec-
tric ﬁeld. Amazing new physics now appears and this is
accompanied with beautiful new mathematical structure
like the Lorentz invariance of both the Maxwell equations
and of the trajectories of test charges. This is of course

surprising but, at least, the previous rather mystifying
motivation for it has now been removed.

Jammer and Stachel discuss what might have hap-
pened if Maxwell had worked in between Amp´ere and
Faraday.34 As in the standard textbook derivation of
Maxwell’s equations one may ﬁrst derive the static limit
of Maxwell’s equations from the laws of Coulomb and
Biot-Savart combined with the static continuity equa-
tion. At this stage Maxwell might have added the dis-
placement current before the discovery of Faraday’s law.
This would result in the EQS model which, according to
Jammer and Stachel, is exactly Galilei invariant. They
suggest in the article abstract that the discovery of Fara-
day ”would have confronted physicists with the dilemma:
give up the Galilean relativity principle for electromag-
netism (ether hypothesis), or modify it (special relativ-
ity). This suggest a new pedagogical approach to elec-
tromagnetic theory, in which the displacement current
and the Galilean relativity principle are introduced be-
fore the induction term is discussed.” This approach is
however less striking than it ﬁrst seems. We like to in-
clude the appropriate invariance structure not only for
the ﬁeld equations but also for the trajectories of test
charges. Here one get problems with the Galilei invari-
ance of EQS while the Lorentz invariance of Maxwell’s
equations is perfect. The problem of ﬁnding satisfac-
tory quasistatic and Galilei invariant approximations to
Maxwell’s equations is not an easy one.35

A third approach to Maxwell equations is of more qua-
sistatic nature. We avoid in this derivation the static
limit of Maxwell’s equation by allowing for (trivial) time-
dependence in the laws of Coulomb (1) and Biot-Savart
(2). We obtain the diﬀerential equations of EQS (i.e. the
equations (11), (12), (14)) and (15) by pure mathematics
if we also use the (time-dependent) continuity equation
(4). Maxwell’s equations now follow directly when the
Faraday law is introduced. Also in this case (like in the
standard textbook derivation) a question may appear.
Why do the magnetic induction experiments of Faraday
imply electromagnetic waves and time-retardation? The
answer is somewhat more hidden in this case. The elec-
tric ﬁeld in EQS is a pure Coulomb ﬁeld EC but when
we include magnetic induction we also get the Faraday
electric ﬁeld EF . It is now not clear if we should have
E or EC in (14).
In the latter case (the minimal as-
sumption) we get the Darwin model and no qualitatively
new physics appears (only what is needed to explain the
experiments of Faraday). The step from Amp´ere-Darwin
to the Amp´ere-Maxwell law has already been discussed.

IV. THE LAWS OF COULOMB AND
BIOT-SAVART IN TIME-DEPENDENT THEORY

The laws of Coulomb and Biot-Savart provide a start-
ing point for the static theory of electromagnetics. Let
us consider the following two questions:

1. How should the static laws of Coulomb and Biot

7

-Savart be generalized to time-dependent theory?

2. Consider the trivial generalization given by the
equations (1) and (2) where time is included as a
parameter. What is the signiﬁcance of these for-
mulas?

These questions are usually not addressed in the text-
books. The ﬁrst question is considered by Jeﬁmenko and
the resulting formulas involves (as must be expected) in-
tegrals where the retarded time appears.29 Jeﬁmenko’s
generalized laws of Coulomb and Biot-Savart are used by
Griﬃths and Heald to address the second question. They
ﬁnd that2

(a) The generalized Biot-Savart law reduces to the
standard one if ∂2J/∂t2 = 0 (then, from the conti-
nuity equation, also ∂3ρ/∂t3 = 0).

(b) The generalized Coulomb law reduces to the stan-
dard one if ∂J/∂t = 0 (and thus also ∂2ρ/∂t2 = 0).

(c) The law of Amp´ere holds if ∂2J/∂t2 = 0 and

∂ρ/∂t = 0.

These results are all suﬃcient conditions for the laws
but only (c) is also necessary. Below necessary and suf-
ﬁcient conditions are formulated.
It is natural to con-
sider the validity of Coulomb and Biot-Savart in time-
dependent theory from the perspective of quasistatics.
We may divide electromagnetics into three regimes: stat-
ics, quasistatics and high frequency. However, statics is
just a particular case of the general Maxwell equations
while quasistatics is an approximation. This motivate a
third question :

3. When does it happen that a solution in quasistatics

is an exact solution to Maxwell’s equations?

It will be shown that a solution of the Darwin model
also solves Maxwell’s equations if and only if the current
has the form

J (r, t) = a (r)t + b (r)

∂EC (r, t)
∂t

ε0

−

(43)

where the Coulomb ﬁeld is deﬁned by (6) and the vec-
torﬁelds a and b satisfy
b = 0. Formally we
write this

a =

∇ ·

∇ ·

Maxwell + Biot-Savart

Darwin + Eq.(43)

(44)

⇐⇒
Let us compare this with (a) above. The last term in
(43) may appear new and unfamiliar in the context of
being a part of the true current (this term but with op-
posite sign is familiar as a part of the displacement cur-
rent). However, this term is just the solenoidal part of
the current. Thus consider any current density J and
write it uniquely in accordance with Helmholtz theorem
as the sum of two parts J = JT + JL where JT is irrota-
tional and JL is solenoidal.20,36 Then it follows from the

−

continuity equation and the time-derivative of (9) that
JL =
ε0∂EC /∂t. The result (a) may be reformulated
in a way similar to (44) but then we only get the left im-
plication (i.e.”
”) and the last term in (43) is then as-
sumed to be linear in time. The leaking capacitor is one
of a few examples below showing that quasistatics may
apply exactly also with a nonlinear time-dependence of
the current.

⇐

Let us now prove (44) and start with the right im-
plication. That Darwin is satisﬁed follows directly from
the equivalence (20). Then both Amp´ere-Maxwell and
Amp´ere-Darwin are satisﬁed implying ∂EF /∂t = 0.
From (8) it then follows that ∂2B/∂t2 = 0. From the
second order time-derivative of Amp´ere-Darwin and (12)
we now get

∂2
∂t2 (cid:18)

J + ε0

∂EC
∂t (cid:19)

= 0

(45)

and (43) easily follows (including the conditions

a =
b = 0). Consider next the left implication in (44). By
∇ ·
substituting (43) in the Maxwell-Darwin equation we ﬁnd
B = µ0(at+ b) so that B is at most linear in t. From
∇×
the time-derivative of (8) we then get ∂EF /∂t = 0. In
this case the Amp´ere-Darwin and the Amp´ere-Maxwell
laws are the same and the solution to Darwin also solves
Maxwell’s equations.

∇ ·

Above we found a necessary and suﬃcient condition
(44) for the exact validity of Biot-Savart’s law within
Maxwell’s equations. Thereby the result (a) of Griﬃths
and Heald was generalized. Let us now consider the cor-
responding result for Coulomb’s law and allow for a cur-
rent of the form

J (r, t) = b (r)

∂EC (r, t)
∂t

ε0

−

(46)

where

b = 0. We will prove that

∇ ·

Maxwell + Coulomb

EQS + Eq.(46)

(47)

⇐⇒
Let us start with the right implication in (47). From
Coulomb’s law it follows the E-ﬁeld is conservative so
that EQS is obtained from Maxwell. From Faraday’s
law it then follows that ∂B/∂t = 0 and from the time-
derivative of Amp´ere-Maxwell we now get (using E =
EC )

∂

J + ε0

and (46) easily follows. To obtain the left implication
of (47) we ﬁrst substitute (46) in Amp´ere-Maxwell and
B = µ0b. This equation together with (12)
obtain.
results in a time-independent B-ﬁeld and thus Faraday’s
law is satisﬁed. This is what is needed for the Maxwell
equations to be valid for an EQS solution. The proof of
(47) is now completed and the result (b) is generalized.
Let us ﬁnally consider the result (c) involving Amp´ere’s
law. This condition turns out to be not only suﬃcient

8

but also necessary. Consider a current density of the form

J (r, t) = a (r)t + b (r)

(49)

where the vectorﬁelds a and b satisfy
Then

a =

b = 0.

∇ ·

∇ ·

⇐⇒

Maxwell + Amp´ere

MQS + Eq.(49) + Eq.(4)

(50)
Consider ﬁrst the right implication. Both Amp´ere’s law
and Amp´ere-Maxwell are valid so ∂E/∂t = 0. By us-
ing the time-derivative of Faraday’s law we then ﬁnd
∂2B/∂t2 = 0 so from the second order time-derivated
Amp´ere’s law we get ∂2J/∂t2 = 0. Then (49) follows if
we also use that the current has zero divergence. The
left implication in (47) is obtained by just reversing the
procedure above.

We will now consider a few examples involving the re-
sults above. The ﬁrst one will also be used in the next
subsection.

Example 1 Consider an (inﬁnitely) long solenoid or a
toroidal coil with time-varying current I (t). We assume
the coils are winded so that we may neglect the axial cur-
rent in the solenoid and the poloidal current in the toroid.

Within quasistatic we get (exactly) zero B-ﬁeld out-
side the coils (from the Biot-Savart law and symmetry).
The MQS and Darwin models coincide because there is
no charge density and accordingly EC = 0. There is
a magnetically induced electric ﬁeld E = EF outside
the coils in spite the fact that the B-ﬁeld vanishes ex-
actly. In general this is only an approximative solution
to the Maxwell equations since the Amp´ere law (and of
course the Amp´ere-Darwin law) rather than the Amp´ere-
Maxwell law is satisﬁed outside the coils. An exact so-
lution is obtained, as we have seen, when the current is
linear in time. The electric ﬁeld is then constant in time.
The second example shows that quasistatics may agree
exactly with Maxwell’s equations even when he time-
variation is quite arbirary.

Example 2 Consider any given spherically symmetric
charge and current density satisfying the continuity equa-
tion (4).

∇ ×

∇ ×

E =

By the spherical symmetry we get

B = 0.
The solution to EQS, Darwin and Maxwell’s equations is
E = EC, B = 0 and J =
ε0∂EC/∂t which is valid for
−
any prescribed charge density ρ = ρ (r, t) in (6). The
equivalences (44) and (47) apply with a = b = 0. A
particular case is a leaking spherical capacitor. We as-
sume that the medium in between the spherical plates
has some conductance and does not violate the spheri-
cal symmetry. In between the plates there is, during the
slow discharge, zero charge density. The Amp´ere law is
clearly not satisﬁed because B = 0 while J

= 0.

The examples 3-5 below illustrates that in a linear,
isotropic and homogeneous conductor the conduction
current (assuming Ohm’s law), in certain cases, does not

6
create any magnetic ﬁeld. This corresponds to exact so-
lutions of Maxwell’s equations that also solves EQS and
Darwin.

The vanishing of the B-ﬁeld is a static phenomena
while in the nonstatic case there is a small magnetic
ﬁeld outside the solenoid.

Example 3 Let us now consider an example without
symmetry in the charge distribution. Space is assumed to
be linear, isotropic, conducting and homogeneous charac-
terized by (ε0, µ0, σ). Assume that we at time t = 0 know
the charge density ρ (r, 0) = ρ0 (r).

From J = σE in the continuity equation and by use of

Gauss law we ﬁnd

ρ (r, t) = e

−(σ/ε0)tρ0 (r)

(51)

The corresponding solution to Maxwell’s equation is

E (r, t) = e

−(σ/ε0)tE0 (r) ,

B = 0

(52)

where E0 (r) is the Coulomb ﬁeld due to the charge den-
sity ρ0 (r).

Example 4 The last example above may be modiﬁed so
that we are dealing with a ﬁnite conductor surrounded
by free space. Let the conductor contain all given charge
ρ0 (r) at time t = 0 and let the surface of the conductor
be an equipotential surface of V0 (r) deﬁned by

V0 (r) =

1

4πε0 Z Z Z

ρ0 (r′)
R

′

dτ

(53)

Inside the conductor both the charge distribution and
the solution to Maxwell’s equations is the same as in
the previous example. Outside the ﬁelds are static with
V0 and B = 0. The surface charge
E = E0 (r) =
density on the conductor is

where ˆn is the outward normal.

Example 5 Related to the last example is the leaking
capacitor of arbitrary geometry and with homogeneous,
isotropic and weakly conducting material in between the
two perfect conductors.4

In this case we must deﬁne V0 (r) by Laplace equation
with appropiate boundary conditions on the two perfect
conductors. The solution may be then expressed in terms
of E = E0 (r) =
V0 as in the two last examples above.

V. A QUASISTATIC PERSPECTIVE ON
QUESTION #6

A time-varying current of a long solenoid causes an
induced electric ﬁeld at the outside. But how can that
be? There is no magnetic ﬁeld at the outside! A.P French
asked a similar question and it was addressed in several
papers.5,6,7,8,9 The answers included two essential points

9

•

•

It is not good to consider the time-varying elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld as a source for the induced elec-
tric ﬁeld, the source is rather the time-varying
current.16

However, even though both these statements are cor-
rect in view of the Maxwell equations, there may remain
some uncomfortable feelings. The way we in practice cal-
culate the induced electric ﬁeld from Faraday’s law make
it natural to think in terms of the time-varying B-ﬁeld as
a source and, even if there is a small B-ﬁeld outside the
solenoid, the main part of this source is well separated in
space from the eﬀect we consider (i.e. the induced out-
side E-ﬁeld). This apparent action at a distance seems
to contradict the local action quality of Maxwell’s equa-
tions. But of course, a careful analysis shows that there
is no true contradiction involved.

If we use a quasistatic model

Let us now consider this problem from a diﬀerent point
of view.
in the calcula-
tions it may be favorable to also think in terms of this
model and not in terms of the full set of Maxwell’s equa-
tions. This is analogous to what we often do in other
ﬁelds of physics. For example we use classical mechanics
without worrying about quantum mechanics, Newtonian
kinematics without referring to special relativity or New-
tons law of gravitation without thinking about general
relativity.
It is in the solenoid example easy to calcu-
late the magnetic and electric ﬁelds using quasistatics.
One gets an exact solution within the quasistatic model
and a good approximation to the true Maxwell solution.
This quasistatic solution (of MQS and Darwin) has no
magnetic ﬁeld at all outside the solenoid. This solution
is fundamentally inconsistent with Maxwell’s equations
since there is a time-varying E-ﬁeld in free space where
the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes exactly. However, the so-
lution is of course consistent with quasistatics. This is
an indication of the quite diﬀerent nature of quasistatic
models and Maxwell’s equations. The PDE’s appearing
in quasistatics are often elliptic or parabolic while the
Maxwell equations are hyperbolic. The conceptual prob-
lems have their roots in using quasistatic calculations but
interpreting the result using Maxwell’s equations.

VI. ELECTROMAGNETIC SIMULATIONS

A. The PC in basic courses

Electromagnetic simulations are essential to electrical
and electronic product designs in many industries. A
broad range of important applications are within the
quasistatic regime like motors, sensors, power genera-
tors, transformer systems and Micro Electro Mechanical
Systems (MEMS). Industrial and scientiﬁc applications
may involve extensive calculations and accordingly the

need for much computational power. However, the usual
PC has developed enormously and so has the software
for simulations with increasingly user friendly interfaces.
Today the PC is a suﬃciently powerful tool for model-
ing many electromagnetic phenomena within just seconds
of computational time. This makes it potentially useful
as an instrument for teaching basic electrodynamics. In
the PC lab students may simulate various electromag-
netic phenomena. Examples within statics or quasistat-
ics include the edge eﬀects in the parallel plate capacitor,
distributed currents in conductors of various shapes, the
Hall eﬀect, magneto resistance, the appearance of non
vanishing charge density in inhomogeneous conductors,
the electric ﬁeld outside and surface charge on a conduc-
tor with currents, various objects placed in a given ex-
ternal static or time-varying electromagnetic ﬁelds, eddy
currents, inductive heating, magnetic diﬀusion, magnetic
shielding and more.

The use of electromagnetic simulations as an eﬀec-
tive pedagogical tool also presupposes some support from
theory. One should in particular focus more on how
Maxwell’s equations are used to formulate well-posed
PDE-problems for various physical situations. Most
textboks, at least the basic ones, are not much inﬂuenced
by the appearance of computers. Their guiding principle
is to ﬁnd analytical solutions in simple and instructive
cases. The underlying PDE-problem may not be needed
explicitly in some examples like when integral laws are
used in very symmetric cases or when tricks like mirror
charges or mirror currents work. When the PDEs are ac-
tually used, and this is much more the case in the more
advanced texts, one ﬁnds solutions in terms of integrals
and series by comparatively tedious calculations involv-
ing, for example, special functions and variable separa-
tion.

With a numerical PDE-solver available the situation is
somewhat diﬀerent. The formulation of well posed PDE-
problems for various phenomena is now motivated with-
out the intention of ﬁnding analytical solutions. This
is an easy part of the PDE theory for electromagnet-
ics and it is instructive by providing increased insight
into the structure of Maxwell’s equations. It is in par-
ticular important and sometimes straightforward to ﬁnd
how Maxwell’s equations reduce thanks to various sym-
metries. For example, the independence of one Cartesian
coordinate or alternatively an axial symmetry results in
a decoupling of Maxwell’s equations. A simple inspec-
tion of the equations written in component form reveals
this structure. Such symmetries explain, for example,
why the magnetic ﬁeld of a toroidal coil only has an az-
imuthal component or why there are TE and TM modes
in planar wave-guides. In the next subsection we illustate
this by formulating PDE problems for eddy currents.

10

B. Equations for eddy currents

Eddy currents and associated phenomena like induc-
tive heating, magnetic shielding and magnetic diﬀusion
are in practice very common since the basic ingredients
are just a conductor and a time-varying electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Still eddy currents are not much discussed in the
textbooks. An exception is the one by Smythe where a
whole chapter is devoted to eddy currents and analytical
solutions are given in terms of series and integrals.37 An
interesting method of images may be used to calculate
eddy currents in a thin conducting sheet. The theory
was developed by Maxwell and reformulated in modern
terms by Saslow.38 However, the analytical theory for
eddy currents is still comparatively diﬃcult. Electromag-
netic modeling on a PC is today an attractive and easy
way to include more about eddy currents in basic courses.
Eddy current problems fall into two classes, steady-
state and transient. In steady state analysis (also called
time-harmonic analysis) we simply replace ∂/∂t with the
factor jω and allow for complex valued ﬁelds. Maxwell
equations becomes time-independent and much easier to
solve. Physically we may obtain a steady-state condition
suﬃciently long time after the start of a time-harmonic
source of the ﬁelds. The initial transient behavior is not
considered in this analysis. The steady state Maxwell
equations may be further simpliﬁed in quasistatic situa-
tions, this may be useful for analytical theory but is not of
much interest for electromagnetic simulations. However,
in time-dependent (transient) analysis an initial value
PDE must be solved. Then a quasistatic approximation
may imply a major numerical simpliﬁcation changing a
hyperbolic PDE into an parabolic or elliptic one.

Let us assume that the time-variation is slow enough
so that quasistatic theory applies. But what quasistatic
model should we use in the study of eddy currents; EQS,
MQS or Darwin? Obviously not EQS since magnetic
induction (Faraday’s law) is outside the scope of that
model. What about MQS? This seems to be the standard
model for eddy currents calculation but it may in fact
only be used in some particular cases.15,37,39 A quite com-
mon misunderstanding concerning the quasistatic ap-
proximation may partly explain the popularity of MQS.27
Let us now consider situations where the use of MQS
may be justiﬁed. This happens in certain symmetric
cases when MQS and Darwin are equivalent models. We
consider below two examples of such symmetries. The
ﬁrst one include, as a special case, the situation when
Maxwell’s theory for eddy currents in thin conducting
sheets applies.38

Example 6 Consider a body in which the conductivity
σ = σ(z) only varies in the z-direction. In the xy
di-
rections the body is homogeneous and of ”inﬁnite” extent.
The electromagnetic ﬁeld is created by the use of an ex-
ternal current density Je = J e
y (t, x, y, z)ˆy
with vanishing divergence;

In this example there will appear no charge density

and the Darwin model is equivalent to MQS. The reason
is that electric ﬁelds will only appear in directions of

constant conductivity (i.e. they have no z
and they cause no pile up of charge. The system may
be described in terms of the potentials Ax and Ay while
V = Az = 0. From equation (25) with J = Je+σ(

These 3D equations determine the dynamics and may
be used to model physical systems with the above sym-
metry.

A similar 2D axi-symmetric case may also be formu-

lated.

Example 7 We use cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z) and
a rotationally symmetric conducting body with conduc-
tivity σ = σ(r, z). The external current density is Je =
J e(t, r, z)ˆφ.

Also in this case there will appear no charge density.
Some potentials vanishes, V = Ar = Az = 0, and the
system may be described in terms of the vector potential
A = A(t, r, z)ˆφ. This time we get the equation for the
dynamics as

The equations may easily be studied by using a PC and
some PDE-solver.40 For example, a straight copper wire
above a copper plate is considered by Backstrom using
equation (55) and the solver FlexPDE.41 He also con-
siders a similar example using (56) for a circular copper
wire above a circular copper plate. The transient ﬁelds
appearing when a current is turned on in the wire is stud-
ied (pages 75 and 99 in Backstrom’s book). The same
models are also easily studied using Comsols Mulphysics
with the Electromagnetic Module. These problems are
numerically simple and, of course, there are many other
PDE solvers that may be used. Such numerical tools
make it possible to consider many cases for which there
are no analytical solutions.

The examples above were carefully designed in order to
avoid charge density. This is also true for all eddy current
examples in Saslows’ paper (see in particular Appendix
B of that paper).38 Usually there will however appear
time-varying surface charge on conductors with eddy cur-
rents and, in case of an inhomogeneous conductor, there
will also appear charge density inside the conductor. In
order to describe the physics we then need to include
the scalar potential in the analysis and MQS cannot be
used An interesting possibility is then to use the Dar-
win model. Such applications of Darwin’s model have
been suggested in connection with eddy currents in the
human body caused by high voltage transmission lines.42

11

The traditional use of Darwin’s model is not eddy cur-
rents but concerns charged particle beams and plasma
simulations.

Let us write equations for the Darwin model in term
of potentials. The conducticity of a possibly inhomoge-
neous conductor is σ = σ(r) and that the time-dependent
external current Je = Je (t, r) is prescribed The total
current may be written J = Je + σ(
∂A/∂t). We
use, as always in the Darwin model, the Coulomb gauge
A = 0. The dynamics of the potentials are determined

These equations have a non-standard appearance by
containing mixed time and spatial derivatives. They may
however be solved using Comsol Multiphysics. Actu-
ally there is a considerable freedom for the user to en-
ter non-standard equations in this PDE-solver. This is
achieved by making the equations available also on the
”weak form” level which is the natural form for the ﬁ-
nite element method. The numerical solutions appears,
at least qualitatively, to behave in an expected way for
the few examples that we have considered. The practical
usefulness of the Darwin model for eddy current calcula-
tions remains however to be proven.

A qualitatively new feature of Darwin’s model (as op-
posed to MQS or EQS) is the possibility of resonance.
Since the Darwin model includes both capacitive and in-
ductive phenomena it may in principle be used to model
systems where the energy oscillates between the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. Consider, for example, a ﬁeld theo-
retic version of a LC-circuit. A suitable design for such
an application may be a resonator in the form of a short
coaxial cable where one end is short circuited by a metal
plate and the other end is still electrically open but with
increased capacitance created by the use of two close par-
allel plates, connected to the inner and outer conduc-
tor, respectively. This kind of resonator has applications
in connection with electron beam devices at microwave
frequencies (example 3.4.1 in the textbook of Haus and
Melcher).11 The resonance frequency of a LC-circuit is
f = 1/√LC but the frequency must be low enough not
to violate the quasistatic assumption. In the above de-
sign of a resonator the most essential method to achieve
this (in the absence of dielectrics or magnetic materials)
is to make the capacitance large and thus take the two
capacitor plates very close to each other.

VII. SUMMARY

Maxwell’s equations are fundamental for the descrip-
tion of electromagnetic phenomena and valid for an enor-

mous range of spatial and temporal scales. The static
limit of the theory is well deﬁned and of course much
easier. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds may in this limit
be given by the laws of Coulomb and Biot-Savart. How-
ever, as soon as there is any time-dependence we should
in principle use the full set of Maxwell’s equations with
all their complexities. Time-retardation is a fundamen-
tally important but also a complicating feature. Using
Maxwell’s equations means in analytical theory that even
if the eﬀect is small it will not vanish and this makes the
theory unnecessary complicated.
In numerical analysis
these eﬀects, however small, may force us to use smaller
timesteps (for numerical stability) and expensive calcu-
lations.
It is therefore useful to introduce quasistatic
approximations in Maxwell’s equations. The quasistatic
models are also useful for a better understanding both
of low frequency electrodynamics and for explaining the
transition from statics to the general high frequency elec-
trodynamics. This have been discussed in the present
paper and below we list a few major points.

(1) The quasistatic limit of Maxwell’s equations is a
kind of c
limit obtained by neglecting time-
retardation. The Darwin model is obtained if we
use the Coulomb gauge.

→ ∞

(2) The Darwin model involves both capacitive and in-
ductive features but there is no radiation and the
interactions are instantaneous. Poynting’s theorem
for this model shows that there is both electric and
magnetic energy, but the electric energy only in-

12

cludes the Coulomb part of electric ﬁeld.

(3) EQS and MQS may be considered as approxima-
tions of the Darwin model. EQS includes capaci-
tance but not inductance while MQS includes in-
ductance but not capacitance. Poynting’s theorems
for these models show that there are only electric
energy in EQS and only magnetic energy in MQS.

(4) The law of Biot-Savart is valid within EQS, MQS

and the Darwin model.

(5) The law of Coulomb is of general signiﬁcance for
quasistatics (EQS, MQS and Darwin) as is obvious
when we use the formulation in terms of force laws
(subsection IIA) or use potentials (subsection IID).

(6) The law of Amp´ere is not of general signiﬁcance
It is valid only in MQS but

within quasistatics.
not within EQS and Darwin.27

(7) Galilei invariance of quasistatics is a somewhat del-
icate issue. Galilei invariance structures may be
deﬁned for EQS and MQS but if we like the force
to have the corresponding invariance then only the
electric force is included in EQS and only the mag-
netic force in MQS.35

(8) Quasistatics has important applications in electro-

magnetic modeling of transient phenomena.

16 It has always been tempting to regard ∂B/∂t in Faraday’s
law as a source of an electric ﬁeld. This has sometimes
caused confusion and objections; currents and charges
should be considered as the only sources of electromagnetic
ﬁelds. The integrals expressing the ﬁelds in terms of these
sources involves in general the retarded time so that the
news from the sources propagates with the ﬁnite velocity c
˙Howevever, in quasistatic approximations the interactions
are instantaneous so this objection is less valid.

17 The notations in Ref.1 has been the preferred choice in this
paper but here is one exception. Griﬃths use a script lower
case ”r” instead of ”R” but unfortunately I have not found
a nice representation of this symbol on my computer.

18 The static continuity equation together with (1) and (2)
constitute a quasistatic model without capacitive or induc-
tive eﬀects.

19 It is important to note that the integral (7) converges. This
is evident from the law of Biot-Savart which implies that
the B-ﬁeld goes to zero as 1/r2 when r → ∞.

20 We consider physical systems where the charges and cur-
rents do not extend to spatial inﬁnity and may use as
boundary conditions that the ﬁelds approach zero suﬃ-
ciently fast far away.

21 This is never a problem according to Ref. 11 but I have
not been able to convince myself that this is true under all
circumstances.

22 Amp´ere’s law ∇×H = Jf diﬀers from (16) if there is a non-
vanishing polarisation current ∂P/∂t. However, Amp´ere’s
law is strictly speaking a static equation and we prefer to
use (16) as a time-dependent generalization with the same
name.

23 Like in Ref. 2 we use the names Ampere’s law for equation
(16) and Ampere-Maxwell for (14). Then it seems natural
to use the name Ampere-Darwin for equation (17).

27 There seems to be a quite widespread misunderstand-
ing that quasistatics, deﬁned by the omission of time-
retardation, includes Amp´ere’s law (16) as a valid equa-
tion. This is stated or implied by many textbooks. See for
example Jackson (Ref. 15, p. 218) or Smythe (Ref. 37, p.
368). However, this is not correct for an obvious reason.
Amp´ere’s law implies stationary current and thus constant
charge density. But certainly, a slowly varying charge den-
sity cannot force us to include time-retardation.

A BRIEF NOTE ON THE MAGNETIC

EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRON

Abstract

In this paper it is shown that a recent formulation of the electron in
terms of a Kerr-Newman type metric, exhibits a short range magnetic
eﬀect, as indeed has been observed at Cornell, and also an Aharonov-
Bohm type of an eﬀect.

In a recent model[1, 2, 3] it was shown how an electron could be described
as a Kerr-Newman type black hole with Quantum Mechanical inputs. Such
a scheme lead to a cosmology consistent with all so called large number re-
lations and which predicted that the universe would continue to expand for
ever[4, 5], as indeed has been subsequently observed[6, 7]. Moreover this
scheme also gives a description of the quark picture including such features
as the characteristic fractional charge, handedness, conﬁnement and an order
of magnitude estimate of the masses[8, 9, 10].
We would now like to point out two additional consequences of the above
model, one an extra magnetic eﬀect in the electromagnetic vacuum and the
other an Aharanov-Bohm type eﬀect[11].
We ﬁrst observe that the magnetic component of the ﬁeld of a static elec-
tron as a Kerr-Newman black hole is given in the familiar spherical polar
coordinates by (Cf.refs.[1, 2])

Bˆr =

whereas the electrical part is given by

Eˆr =

r2 + 0(

r3 ), E ˆΘ = 0(

r4 ), E ˆφ = 0,

(2)

A comparison of (1) and (2) shows that there is a magnetic component of
shorter range apart from the dipole which is given by the ﬁrst term on the
right in equation (1)– infact this model also exhibits the anomalous gyro
magnetic ratio g = 2 of the electron. We would like to point out that a short
range force the B(3) force mediated by massive photons has indeed been ob-
served at Cornell and studied over the past few years[12].
On the other hand as the Kerr-Newman charged black hole can be approx-
imated by a solinoid, we have as in the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect, a negligible
magnetic ﬁeld outdside, but at the same time a real vector potential ~A which
would contribute to a shift in phase. Infact this shift in phase is given by

∆δ ˆB =

e

¯h I ~A. ~ds

There is also a similar eﬀect due to the electric charge given by

∆δ ˆE = −

e

¯h Z A0dt

(4)

where A0 is the usual electro static potential given in (2).
In the above
Kerr-Newman formulation, ( ~A, A0) of (3) and (4) are given by (Cf.refs.[1, 2])

Aσ =

(ηµvhµv), σ,

From (5) it can be seen that

~A ∼

Substitution of (6) in (3) then gives us the contribution of the shift in phase
due to the magnetic ﬁeld.

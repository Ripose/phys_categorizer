Abstract

We identify new, rather serious, physical and axiomatic inconsistencies of the cur-
rent formulation of string theories due to the lack of invariant units necessary for
lack of preservation in time of Hermiticity-observability, and other
measurements,
shortcomings. We propose three novel reformulations of string theories for matter
of progressively increasing complexity via the novel iso-, geno- and hyper-mathematics
of hadronic mechanics, which resolve the current inconsistencies, while oﬀering new
intriguing possibilities, such as: an axiomatically consistent and invariant formulation
on curved manifolds, the reduction of macroscopic irreversibility to the most primitive
level of vibrations of the universal substratum (ether), or the treatment of multi-valued
biological structures. We then identify three corresponding classical formulations of
string theories for antimatter via the novel anti-isomorphic isodual mathematics. We
ﬁnally outline the intriguing features of the emerging new cosmologies (including bi-
ological structures, as it should be for all cosmologies), such as: universal invariance
(rather than covariance) under a symmetry isomorphic to the Poincar´e group and its
isodual; equal distributions of matter and antimatter in the universe (as a limit case);
continuous creation; no need for the missing mass; signiﬁcantly reduced dimensions;
possibility of experimental identiﬁcation of matter and antimatter in the universe; and
identically null total characteristics of time, energy, linear and angular momentum,
charge, etc.

As it is well known, the origin of the physical consistency of relativistic quantum mechanics
(RQM) is its Lie structure, which we express for subsequent needs with the following ﬁnite
form, inﬁnitesimal version and conjugation,

A(w) = U × A(0) × U † = eiX×w × A(0) × e−iw×X = eiX>w

realized via unitary transformations deﬁned on a Hilbert space H over the ﬁeld C(c, +, ×)
of complex numbers c with conventional sum + and associative) product ×.

In fact, the unitary structure implies the following well known basic invariances:

U × U † = U † × U = I,

I → U × I × U † = I ′ = I,
A × B → U × (A × B) × U † = (U × A × U †) × (U × B × U †) = A′ × B′,
H × |ψ >= E × |ψ >→ U × H × |ψ >= (U × H × U †) × (U × |ψ >) = H ′ × |ψ′ >=
U × E × |ψ >= E′ × |ψ′ >, E′ = E.

(2)

It then follows that all theories with a unitary structure deﬁned on a Hilbert space over
the ﬁeld of complex numbers possess numerically invariant units, products and eigenvalues,
thus being suitable to represent physical reality.

By comparison, theories with a nonunitary structure have serious ﬂaws studied in details

in Refs. [1], because invariances (2) are turned into the following noninvariances,

U × U † = U † × U 6= I,

I → U × I × U † = I ′ 6= I,
A×B → U×(A×B)×U † = (U×A×U †)×(U×U †)−1×(U×B×U †) = A′×T ×B′, T = (U×U †)−1,
H × |ψ >= E × |ψ >→ U × H × |ψ >= (U × H × U †) × (U × U †)−1 × (U × |ψ >) =
H ′ × T × |ψ′ >= U × E × |ψ >= E′ × |ψ′ >, E′ 6= E,

(3)

which imply rather serious physical inconsistencies, such as: the lack of invariance of the
basic units of time, space, energy, etc, which is necessary for consistent measurements; the
lack of preservation in time of Hermiticity, which is necessary to have physically acceptable
observables; lack of uniqueness and invariance in time of the physical predictions of the
theory, and other ﬂaws (for details, see Refs. [1]).

Invariances (3) also have seemingly catastrophic axiomatic inconsistencies at both clas-
sical and operator levels. Recall that all axiomatic structures of physical theories (such as
vector and metric spaces, functional analysis, algebras and groups, etc.) are formulated over
a given ﬁeld of numbers which, in turn, is crucially dependent on the unit. The alteration in
time of the basic unit then implies the loss of the original ﬁeld at subsequent times. This is
due to the fact that the noncanonical-nonunitary transform must be applied, for consistency,
to the totality of the original structure (see below), including numbers, and cannot be applied
only to part of the original structure to please personal preferences. However, noncanonical-
nonunitary theories continue to be generally expressed over the original ﬁeld. The lack of
invariance of the basic unit then implies the inapplicability of the entire axiomatic structure

2

of noncanonical-nonunitary theories without any exception known to this author (for details
see Refs. [1g,3g]).

The above physical and axiomatic inconsistencies reach their climax for all theories
formulated on a curved manifold [1g,3g].
In fact, the map from the minkowski metric
η = diag.(1, −1, −1, −1) = constant to a Riemannian metric g(x) = function is transpar-
ently a noncanonical transform, η → g(x) = U(x) × η × U t(x), U(x) × U t(x) 6= I. Operator
theories on curved manifolds must then be necessarily nonunitary. As a result, the above
physical and axiomatic inconsistencies hold at both classical and operator levels (see also
[1g,3g] for brevity).

We therefore have the following

THEOREM 1 [1]: All operator theories with a nonunitary structure formulated on a
conventional Hilbert space over the ﬁeld of complex numbers, including (but not limiting to)
all operator theories of gravity on a manifold with non-null curvature, possess the following
physical and axiomatic inconsistencies:

I) lack of invariant units of space, time, energy, etc., with consequentially impossible

applications to real measurements as well as loss of the entire axiomatic structure;

II) lack of preservation of the original Hermiticity in time, with consequential absence of

physically acceptable observables;

III) general violation of probability and causality laws;
IV) lack of invariance of conventional and special functions and transforms used in data

V) lack of uniqueness and invariance of numerical predictions;
VI) General violation of the superposition principle with consequential inapplicability to

elaborations;

composite systems;

VII) General violation of Mackey imprimitivity theorem with consequential violation of

Galilei’s and Einstein’s special relativities.

All classical noncanonical theories formulated on conventional spaces over conventional
ﬁelds, including (but not limited to) all classical theories of gravity formulated on a manifold
with non-null curvature, are aﬄicted by corresponding physical and axiomatic inconsistencies
which prevent their consistent representation of physical reality.

The above physical inconsistencies have been identiﬁed to occur for numerous theories,
such as (see [1g] for details and literature): 1) Dissipative nuclear models with imaginary
potentials; 2) Statistical models with external collisions terms; 3) q-, k- and *-deformations;
4) Certain quantum groups (evidently those with a nonunitary structure); 5) Weinberg’s
nonlinear theory; 6) All known theories of classical and quantum gravity on curved manifolds;
7) All known supersymmetric theories; 8) All known Kac-Moody theories; and other theories.
In this note we point out apparently for the ﬁrst time that, despite an undeniable math-
ematical beauty, the physical inconsistencies of Theorem 1 also apply to current, classical
[2] and vast literature quoted
and operator formulations of string theories (see, e.g., Refs.

3

therein), because of various reasons, such as:

A) The known nonunitary character of string theories formulated via the Beta function

according to Veneziano and Suzuki;

B) The more recent supersymmetric formulations of string theories, because it implies

the exiting from Lie’s axioms (1) with consequential noninvariances (3);

C) Recent formulations of string theories on curved manifolds (see, e.g., [2b]) because

they imply the additional, independent, rather serious inconsistencies mentioned earlier.

The only way known to this author to resolve these inconsistencies is that of reformulating
string theories in such a way to regain the original invariances (2) in their totality. In turn,
the only way known to this author to achieve such an objective is the use of the new formalism
of hadronic mechanics (see Ref.s [3,4,5] and large literature quoted therein).

The invariant reformulations of closed-isolated string systems requires the isomathematics
used in the isotopic branch of hadronic mechanics, and are here called isotopic string theories
(IST). Isomathematics is essentially based on lifting the conventional n-dimensional unit I =
diag.(1, 1, ..., 1) into a (nonsingular) n × n-dimensional quantity ˆI, called isounit (where the
preﬁx ”iso-” means ”axiom-preserving” character). In particular, ˆI possesses an unrestricted
functional dependence on time t, coordinates r, momenta p, wavefunctions ψ, and any other
needed variable. Jointly, the conventional associative product A×B among generic quantities
A, B (such as numbers, vector ﬁelds, operators, etc.) must be lifted into a form, called
isoproduct, which admits ˆI as the new right and left unit,

I = diag.(1, 1, ..., 1) → ˆI(t, r, p, ψ, ...) = U × U † = 1/ ˆT 6= I,

A × B → A ˆ×B = A × ˆT × B,
ˆI ˆ×A = A ˆ× ˆI = A.

(4)

The explicit construction of the IST then essentially requires:
a) The identiﬁcation of the background canonical-unitary theory, generally consisting
of RQM on a Minkowski space M = M(x, η, F ) with spacetime coordinates x and metric
η = diag.(1, −1, −1, −1) on the reals F = F (n, +, ×);

b) The identiﬁcation of the (noncanonical or) nonunitary transform of η into the new

metric g(x) of the considered string theory, g(x) = U × η × U †;

c) The assumption of the isounit ˆI = U × U † 6= I;

and the reconstruction of the totality of the conventional formalism into such a form to
admit ˆI as the correct left and right new unit, with no exception known to this author.

This implies the lifting of [3f]: conventional numbers and ﬁelds into the isonumbers ˆc
and isoﬁelds ˆC(ˆc, ˆ+, ˆ×); conventional diﬀerential calculus into the isodiﬀerential calculus;
conventional Hilbert spaces with related states and inner product into isohilbert spaces ˆH
with isostates and isoinner product; conventional eigenvalues equations into isoeigenvalue
equations, etc., according to the rules

ˆc = U × c × U † = c × ˆI, ˆc1 ˆ+ˆc2 = (c1 + c2) × ˆI, ˆc1 ˆ×ˆc2 = (c1 × c2) × ˆI,

4

ˆrk = rk × ˆI, ˆdˆrk = ˆI k

i × dˆri, ˆ∂ˆ/ ˆ∂ˆrk = ˆT i

k × ∂/∂ri, ˆ∂ˆriˆ/∂ˆrj = ˆδi

k = δi

k × ˆI,

| ˆφ >= U × |φ >, U× < φ| × |ψ > ×U † =< ˆφ| ˆ×| ˆψ > × ˆI,
U × H × |φ >= ˆH ˆ×| ˆφ >= U × E × |φ >= ˆE ˆ×| ˆφ >= E × | ˆφ >, ˆH = U × H × U †.

(5)

The transformation theory of the new string theory is then strictly nonunitary. However,
for consistency, all possible nonunitary transforms must be rewritten as isounitary transforms
on ˆH over ˆC, with consequential regaining of all original invariances (2) [3g], e.g.,

V × V † = ˆI 6= I, V = ˆV × ˆT 1/2, V × V † = ˆV ˆ× ˆV ˆ† = ˆV ˆ† ˆ× ˆV = ˆI,

ˆI → ˆV × ˆI × ˆV ˆ† = ˆI ′ = ˆI,

ˆA ˆ× ˆB → ˆV ˆ×( ˆA ˆ× ˆB) ˆ× ˆV † = V × A × V † × V × B × V

ˆ† = ˆA′ ˆ× ˆB′,

ˆH ˆ×| ˆψ >= ˆE ˆ×| ˆψ >→ ˆV ˆ× ˆH ˆ×| ˆψ >= ˆV ˆ× ˆH ˆ× ˆV ˆ† ˆ× ˆV ˆ×| ˆψ >= ˆH ′ ˆ×| ˆψ′ >=
ˆV ˆ× ˆE ˆ×| ˆψ >= ˆE′ ˆ×| ˆψ′ >, ˆE′ = ˆE,

(6)

As one can see, the use of the isotopic formalism of hadronic mechanics implies the full
regaining of the numerical invariance of the isounit, isoproduct and isoeigenvalues, thus
regaining the necessary conditions for physical applications. It is easy to prove that isoher-
miticity coincides with the conventional Hermiticity. As a result, all conventional observ-
ables of unitary theories remain observables under their isotopic lifting. The preservation
of Hermiticity-observability in time is then ensured by the above isoinvariances. Detailed
studies conducted in Ref. [3g] then establish the resolution of all inconsistencies of Theorem
1.

The primary reason for the consistency is the full regaining of the Lie axioms. Again

under nonunitary transforms submitted to isotopic reformulation, we have the rules

U × eX × U † = ˆe ˆX = (e ˆX× ˆT ) × ˆI = ˆI(e ˆT × ˆX),

ˆA( ˆw) = ˆU ˆ× ˆA(ˆ0) ˆ× ˆU

ˆ† = ˆei ˆX ˆ×w ˆ× ˆA(ˆ0) ˆ×ˆe−i ˆw ˆ× ˆX = e( ˆX×w)× ˆT × ˆA(ˆ0) × e−i ˆT ×( ˆw× ˆX),

i ˆd ˆAˆ/ ˆd ˆw = ˆA ˆ× ˆX − ˆX ˆ× ˆA = ˆA × ˆT × ˆX − ˆX × ˆT × ˆA = [ ˆAˆ, ˆX],
ˆ†.
ˆei ˆX ˆ× ˆw = [ˆe−i ˆw ˆ× ˆX]

(7)

As one can see, the regaining of Lie’s theory is so strong that the conventional and
In fact, the Lie-Santilli
isotopic theories coincide at the abstract, realization-free level.
isotopic theory [3,4,5] can be formulated by essentially ”putting the hat” to the totality of
symbols and operations of the conventional formulation of Lie’s theory or, equivalently, by
keeping the conventional formulation and subjecting all conventional symbols to the more
general isotopic interpretation.

It should also be recalled that, since I and ˆI are topologically equivalent, the isotopic
images of all Lie groups are locally isomorphic to the original groups. This implies the

5

preservation of the exact validity for nonunitary string theories of the fundamental space-
time symmetries, such as the Poincar´e symmetry, Einstein’s special relativity and well as
relativistic quantum mechanics (see Refs. [3h,3j] for details).

The above reformulation implies a new representation of classical and operator gravity
via an isoﬂat geometry (i.e., a geoometry ﬂat on isospaces over isoﬁelds), introduced by
this author under the name of isominkowskian geometry [3j], which is deﬁned on isospaces
ˆM = ˆM(ˆx, ˆη ˆF ) with isocoordinates ˆx = x × ˆI and isometric ˆη = ˆη(x, v, a, ψ, ...) on the
isoreals ˆF = ˆF (ˆn, ˆ+, ˆ×).

The new classical and operator formulation of gravity was ﬁrst proposed in Ref.
[3i]
(see memoir [3j] for a more recent treatment), in which gravity is merely embedded in the
unit of conventional, classical and operator Minkowskian theories via the factorization of all
possible Riemannian metrics g(x) = ˆTgrav ×η and the assumption of the gravitational isounit
grav. Since curvature is evidently contained in the term ˆTgrav(x), the assumption for
ˆIgrav = ˆT −1
fundamental unit of the inverse, ˆIgrav = ˆT −1
grav, evidently eliminates curvature at the abstract
level. Moreover, ˆT is necessarily positive-deﬁnite (from the local Minkowskian character of
Riemann). As a result, gravity is formulated for the ﬁrst time under a universal invariance
(rather than ”covariance”) isomorphicc to the Poinncar´e symmetry [3h].

Also, the isominkowskian geometry is a symbiotic uniﬁcation of the Minkowskian and
Rienmannian geometries because, on one side, it is locally isomorphic to the Minkowskian
geometry while, on the otehr side, it preserves all the machinery of Riemann (such as co-
variant derivatives, Christoﬀel’s symbols, etc.), although formulated via the isodiﬀerential
calculus (because the isometric depends on x).

One obtains a new classical iso-gravity (CIG) which preserves the conventional Einstein-
Hilbert (and other) ﬁeld equations. Yet, the abandonment of the notion of curvature (which
is necessary to resolve the inconsistencies of Theorem 1) permite the formulation of gravity
as an isocanonical theory under the universal isopoincar´e symmetry, thus resolving the in-
consistencies of Theorem 1. Similarly, one obtains a new operator iso-gravity (OIG) which
coincides at the abstract level with RQM, including the operator version of the universal
isopoincar´e invariance, thus resolving the inconsistencies of Theorem 1 at the operator level
too.

The reconstruction of gravity on an isoﬂat space has permitted the achievement of an
axiomatically consistent grand uniﬁcation of electroweak and gravitational interactions ﬁrst
proposed in Ref.
[3k] (see [3l] for more details) under the name of iso grand-uniﬁcation
(IGU), in which gravity is embedded in the unit of U(2) × U(1). This grand uniﬁcation is
evidently available to string theories in isotopic reformulation.

The explicit formulation of IST is elementary. Consider, for instance, Ref. [2b]. Its basic
assumption is metric (1.3), p. 50, in a curved space g = (1, −a2 × δi
j). It is evident that such
a metric is a noncanonical image of the conventional Minkowski metric g = U × η × U t, U =
diag.(1, a × δi
j). The isotopic reformulation of such a theory then requires the use of the
isounit ˆI = (1, a2 × δi
j) and the reconstruction of the totality of the formalism of Ref.

6

[2b] with respect to ˆI, including numbers, ﬁelds, spaces, algebras, functional analysis, etc.
Invariance and the resolution of the inconsistencies of Theorem 1 then follow.

Note that the construction implies a mere reformulation of conventional string theories

without altering the results.

As an incidental note, it should be mentioned that all papers on the isotopic branch
of hadronic mechanics prior to the appearance of the isodiﬀerential calculus [3f ] in 1996
(beginning with the articles by this author) generally have no physical applications. This is
due to the lack of invariance of the basic dynamical equations because they are formulated
via the conventional diﬀerential calculus, even though the rest of the theories is formulated
on isospaces over isoﬁelds [3g].

For the case of open-irreversible string theories, that is, strings interacting with systems
considered as external, we need the more general genotopic branch of hadronic mechanics
with a Lie-admissible structure ﬁrst proposed by this author in his Ph. D. studies, Ref. [3b] of
1967, as a (p, q)-parametric deformation of quantum mechanics, (A, B) = p×A×B −q×B ×
A, and in Ref. [3c] of 1978 as a (P, Q)-operator deformation, (Aˆ,B) = A×P ×B −B ×Q×A,
where the preﬁx ”geno” now indicates an ”axiom-inducing” character.

Lie-admissible theories reached mathematical maturity only recently in memoir [3f] of
1996 and invariance of physical formulations in the subsequent Ref. [3n] thanks to the ad-
vent of the genodiﬀerential calculus of the preceding memoir [3f]. Therefore, all papers on
Lie-admissible theories prior to Refs. [3f,3n] (beginning with the papers by this author) gen-
erally have no physical applications because of the lack of invariance of the basic dynamical
equations due to their formulation via the conventional diﬀerential calculus.

The construction of open-irreversible genotopic string theories (GTS) requires two dif-
ferent nonunitary systems and related transforms, one for the forward direction of time >
and one for the backward direction <. Consequently, GST need two generalized units called
genounits, two products called genoproducts and corresponding dual formalism, again, one
per each direction of time, along the following main lines

V × V † 6= I, W × W † 6= I,

V × W † = ˆI > = 1/ ˆS, ˆA > ˆB = ˆA × ˆS × ˆB, ˆI > > ˆA = ˆA > ˆI > = ˆA,
W × V † =< ˆI = 1/ ˆR, ˆA < ˆB = ˆA × ˆR × ˆB,< ˆI < ˆA = ˆA << ˆI = ˆA,
ˆA = ˆA†, ˆB = ˆB†, ˆR = ˆS†.

(8)

The above elements must then be completed, for necessary reasons of consistency, with
the forward and backward genoﬁelds, genospaces, genodiﬀerential calculus, genogeometries,
etc. [3f,3h,3r].

The procedure yields the following Lie-admissible realization of Lie’s axioms (1) at a
ﬁxed value of the parameter w (thus without its ordering and by omitting the ordering in
the individual generators for simplicity of notation) [3c,3d]

ˆX = ˆX †, ˆR = ˆS†.

(9)

It should be stressed that structures (9) merely provide a broader realization of the
In fact, the
original Lie axioms (1), which is the basic theme of hadronic mechanics [3].
original Lie axioms (1) have a bimodular associative structure, with a modular-associative
action to the right and a separate one to the left. These actions do not need to be given by
the simplest conceivable realization of current use, because the isotopic realization is equally
admissible. The lack of necessary identity of the two modular-isotopic actions then yields
genotopic structures (9), provided that conjugation (1c) is veriﬁed.

In Ref.

[3a] of 1956 this author (then in high school) showed how the ”ethereal wind”
used at the time to dismiss the existence of a universal substratum (or ether) had no solid
physical foundations because said universal substratum is needed not only to propagate
electromagnetic waves, but also for the very existence of elementary particles (such as the
electrons), which are ”oscillations-vibrations” of the same medium. The author was unaware
at the time that, over twenty years earlier, Schroedinger had proved that the variable ”x”
in Dirac’s equations for the free electron describes precisely an oscillation which can only
be that of the universal; substratum. The transversal character of electromagnetic waves
demands that the universal substratum be a rigid medium. In short, the view presented in
Ref. [3a] is that space is completely full while matter is completely empty. When matter is
moved we merely transfer the oscillations of space from one region to another, thus without
any possible ”ethereal wind”.

The genotopic reformulation of string theories permits quantitative studies along the
view of Ref. [3a]. In fact, GST permit an axiomatically consistent and invariant reduction of
our macroscopic irreversible physical reality to the most elementary entities in the universe,
the vibrations of the universal substratum under open-nonconservative conditions.

As one can see, Lie-admissible structures (9) are structurally irreversible in the sense that
they are irreversible for all possible conventional, reversible Hamiltonians. This is precisely
what needed for a serious study of irreversibility because all action-at-a-distance interactions
are well known to be reversible, while physical reality is irreversible. Irreversibility should
therefore be represented with anything except the Hamiltonian. This is along the historical
teaching by Lagrange and Hamilton who represented irreversibility via the external terms
in their celebrated equations, which terms have been ”truncated” in the literature of this
century. The use of two diﬀerent generalized units for the representation of irreversibility
appears to be preferable over other attempts, evidently because it assures invariance.

Interested readers can then ﬁnd in Refs.

[3f,3n] the invariant genotopic formulation
of: Newton’s equations with contact-nonhamiltonian forces; the true Hamilton equations
(those with external terms); quantization; and quantum mechanics. When applied to string
theories, these formulations then permit the indicated reduction of our classical irreversibility
to the most elementary possible entities, open-nonconservative vibrations of space.

Physics is a science that will never admit ”ﬁnal theories”. By no means GST’s are the

8

most general ones. For completeness we mention the existence of the hyperstructural branch
of hadronic mechanics [3f,3g] whose main characteristic is that of being multi-valued with
hyperunits and hyperproducts,

ˆI > = { ˆI >

1 , ˆI >

2 , ˆI >

3 , ...} = 1/ ˆS,

A > B = {A × ˆS1 × B, A × ˆS2 × B, A × ˆS3 × B, ...}, ˆI > > A = A > ˆI > = A × I,
< ˆI = {< ˆI1,< ˆI2,< ˆI3, ...} = 1/ ˆS,
A < B = {A × ˆR1 × B, A × hatR2 × B, A × ˆR3 × B, ...}< ˆI < A = A << ˆI = A × I,
A = A†, B = B†, ˆR = ˆS†.

(10)

All aspects of the dual Lie-admissible formalism admit a unique, and signiﬁcant extension
to the above hyperstructures, including hypernumbers and ﬁelds, hyperspaces, hyperdiﬀeren-
tial calculus, etc.

The construction of invariant hyper-string theories (HST) is then elementary and will be
left to the interested reader. Their most salient (and intriguing) feature is that of permitting
the existence of a multi-valued universe beginning at the most elementary level of nature,
and in a way compatible with our three-dimensional sensory perception.

A suggestive illustration is given by sea shells [3r]. All their possible shapes can indeed be
fully represented in the conventional Euclidean space corresponding to our three Eustachian
tubes. However, their evolution in time cannot be described via the Euclidean axioms,
trivially, because sea shells are open-nonconservative-irreversible, while the Euclidean axioms
are strictly closed-conservative-reversible. Computer visualizations have shown that the
imposition of the latter to the time evolution of the former implies that sea shells ﬁrst
grow in a deformed way and then they crack. Studies have shown that the quantitative
representation of the growth in time of sea shells requires at least a six dimensional space,
i.e., the doubling of each reference axis.

However, we can directly observe sea shells in our hands as being three-dimensional. The
only reconciliation of these seemingly dissonant occurrences known to this author is that
via hyperformulations [3f]. In fact, the latter are multi-dimensional precisely as needed for
the representation of the growth of sea shells. Yet the axioms remain conventional, thus
achieving compatibility with our sensory perception.

Speciﬁcally, for the case of sea shells we have two-valued hypereuclidean formulations
which are fully compatible with our sensory perception because they are not six-dimensional,
and remain instead fully three-dimensional. After all, there is a dramatic topological diﬀer-
ence between a conventionally six-dimensional space and our two-valued three-dimensional
space.

The above example indicates the possibility of reducing open-nonconservative-irreversible
biological structures to the ultimate vibrations of the universal substratum, thus extending
irreversibility from sole physical systems to include biology.

9

Note that any beliefs in treating the above open-nonconservative-irreversible systems via
conventional quantum mechanics implies exiting science, evidently because of the strictly
closed-conservative-reversible character of the theory. This is the main motivation for the
construction of hadronic mechanics [3].

By no means HST represent the ultimate and most general formulation of string the-
ory. In fact, despite their remarkable generality, hyperformulations (including conventional,
isotopic and, genotopic particularizations) cannot consistently represent antimatter at the
classical level. This is due to the sole existence of one quantization channel, as a consequence
of which the operator images of classical iso, geno and hyper-structures cannot yield charge
conjugated antiparticles, but only particles with the wrong sign of the charge.

The above occurrence is only a symptom of what can be safely claimed to be the biggest
unbalance of theoretical physics of this century: the treatment of matter at all possible levels,
from Newton to second quantization, while antimatter is solely treated at the level of second
quantization.

After a laborious search, the only classical representation of antimatter this author could
identify is that characterized by the following map, called isoduality, here expressed for a
generic quantity A, as well as for the underlying spaces and ﬁelds [3o],

which characterizes the isodual branches of hadronic mechanics [3g].

The above map is mathematically nontrivial, e.g., because it implies the ﬁrst known
numbers with negative units and norm [3e]. Physically, the map is also nontrivial because it
implies an isodual image of our universe which coexists with our own, yet it is distinct from
it. Universes interconnected by isoduality are then anti-isomorphic to each others, as it is
the case for the charge conjugation. In fact, isoduality is equivalent to charge conjugation at
the level of second quantization [3o]. In particular, all physical quantities (and not only the
charge) interconnected by isoduality have opposite signs, although referred to units also with
opposite signs. For instance, time for an isodual antiparticle is negative, although referred to
a negative unit of time -1 sec, thus being as causal as our conventional positive time referred
to the conventional positive unit +1 sec. The kronecker product of a universe and its isodual
is called isoselfdual in the sense of coinciding with its isodual image (see [3o] for details).

Isotopic, genotopic and hyper-string theories therefore admit isodual images whose ex-
plicit construction is left to the interested reader for brevity. Their signiﬁcance is not only
restricted to a classical reduction of antimatter to vibrations at the ultimate possible level of
the universe, but also that of permitting a novel cosmology, here called isoselfdual hyperstring
cosmology (IHSC) along the lines of Ref.
[3m] with rather intriguing characteristics, such
as: 1) deﬁnition of cosmology inclusive of biological structures (as it should be under the
meaning of the term ”cosmos”); 2) same amount of matter and antimatter in the universe
(as a limit conditions under Lie axiom (1c)); 3) open-irreversible structure of the universe
with continuous creation (except for the particular isotopic case); 4) universal isopoincar´e
invariance inclusive of gravitation in isominkowskian reformulation [3l]; 5) lack of need of

10

the ”missing mass”, because the average speed of light c of galaxies and quasars in the law
E = m × c2 is bigger the speed of light in vacuum co whn including all interior grav ita-
tional problems [3m]; 6) considerable reduction of the currently believed size of the universe,
because light exits galaxies and quasars already redshifted due to the decrease of its speed
within the huge and hyperdense astrophysical chromospheres; 7) possibility of future exper-
imental study whether a far away galaxy or quasar is made up of matter or of antimatter
due to the prediction that the photon emitted by antimatter, the isodual photon, is repelled
by gravity and has new parity properties [3o]; 8) identically null total characteristics of time,
mass, energy, etc.; 9) consequential identical topological features of the universe befoire and
after creation; and other intriguing features.

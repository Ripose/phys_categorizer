Abstract

In this paper, we prove that two diﬀerent observers don’t equally measure the distance

between two points A and B. For this, we introduce some postulates and obtain a new

formula to show distance between A and B.

In this formula, radius of universe, n, is

entered such that if n tends to inﬁnity the ordinary distance is obtained.

1 Introduction

T. S. Eliot has said ”Each venture is a new beginning.” We claim this paper is a venture.

This is a new theory about distance, if radius of universe be ﬁnite. This theory can result in

a completely new view of the nature of distance. Ordinary measurement is so much a part of

our daily life that almost everyone has some conceptual diﬃculty in understanding our idea of

distance when he(she) ﬁrst studies it.

Einstein may have put his ﬁnger on the diﬃculty when he said [1] ”Common sense is that

layer of prejudices laid down in the mind prior to the age of eighteen”. Indeed, it has been said

that every great theory begins as a heresy and ends as a prejudice. More than a half-century

of experimentation and application has removed special relativity theory from the heresy stage

and put it on a sound conceptual and practical basis.

In this article, we show that there is a careful analysis of new theory about distance. Fur-
thermore, we obtain a formula to measure distance between two points x and y. In this study,
we measure distance between two points and compare it for two ﬁxed observers. For simplicity,

we consider the problem in one dimension. Assume that universe is bounded, however if the

universe is not bounded, universe radius has a ﬁnite value. Some scientists such as Einstein

and Rimman have believed unboundedness of universe does not mean it is inﬁnite [2, 5].

Einstein has said ”Coming into existence of non-Euclidean geometry resulted in this reality

that inﬁniteness of space is dubitable” [2]. He also has said ”Closed but unbounded spaces

are imaginable” [2]. We can measure relative distance between two frames may be by compar-

ing measurement between frames. But then we have not deduced the relative distance from

observations conﬁned to a single frame.

Furthermore, there is no way at all of determining the absolute distance of an inertial

reference frame. No inertial frame is preferred over any other, for the laws of mechanics are the

same in all. We say that all inertial frame are equivalent as far as mechanics is concerned.

2 Postulates

In this section, for our theory, we introduce some assumptions. Their simplicity and generality

are characteristic of this theory. In this theory what is troublesome, apparently, is the philo-

sophic notion that length and time in the abstract are absolute quantities and the belief that

relativity contradicts this notion. In this ﬁtting, in emphasizing the common sense of relativity,

to conclude with this quotation from Bondi [3] on the presentation of relativity theory:

”At ﬁrst, relativity was considered shocking, anti-establishment and highly mysterious, and all

presentations intended for the population at large were meant to emphasize these shocking and

mysterious aspects, which is hardly conductive to easy teaching and good understanding.”

We explain our postulates as follows:

• Postulate 1. We can select any point as a reference frame (Relativity).

• Postulate 2. Any point in itself frame lies in the center of universe and measures n as

the universe radius (Absolute inﬁnity).

By these postulates we introduce some principles as follows:

• Principle 1. Universe is symmetric in directions (Symmetry principle).

• Principle 2. Every point agrees in the order of place of points (Agreement principle).

• Principle 3. Consider three points O0, O1 and A as the following order

2

then, distance of O0A in O0 point of view is not less than distance of O1A in O1 point of
view (Intuition principle).

Notation. Henceforth, if distance of O0A in O0 point of view is equal to p, we say that point
view of O0 from A is p and we will show this by (O0 7→ A) = p. We show this graphically by

Theorem. If N is a point such that (O 7→ N) = n for a ﬁxed point O, then for any arbitrary
point O1 such that (O1 7→ N1) = n, N1 in point view of O1 is N in point view of O.
Proof. Suppose that O extends the universe as long as n to reach N. Also suppose that O1 ex-
tends the universe as long as n to reach N1. If N1 lies after N in point view of O1 such as Figure 1

by agreement principle N1 in point view of O lies after N. Hence for O the radius of universe
is greater than n, this contradicts with second postulate. Therefore, N1 in point view of O1 lies
before N or coincides it. If N1 in point view of O1 lies before N then O1 measures the universe
radius greater than n. This contradicts with second postulate. Consequently, N1 in point view
of O1 is N in point view of O.
Corollary. For all points, N is a ﬁxed point.

Consider the following ﬁgure, the fundamental question is: what is (A 7→ B)?

In fact, we look for a formula to show distance of A and B. Suppose

(O0 7→ O1) = p, (O0 7→ A) = x

if (O1 7→ A) = x1, we set x1 = f (x, p) and we obtain function f (Figure 3).

hence p′ = f (p, 0). Consider points O0, O1, A, O′

)

By symmetric principle, universe is symmetric in directions. This results in

or

f (p, x) = −f (−p, −x).

(1)

Hence function f must have property (1). Consider (O0 7→ O1) = p and (O1 7→ O0) = p′.
If |p| = |p′| there isn’t anything to prove. Suppose that |p| < |p′|, hence there is a point, for
example, O′, such that (O1 7→ O′) = −p. As |p| < |p′|, in O1 point of view O0 lies between
O1 and O′. Therefore by agreement principle, for any other points O0 lies between O1 and O′
(Figure 6). Now, we obtain (O′ 7→ O1)

as f has property (1) we have

or p′ = f (p, 0) therefore

(O′ 7→ O1) = −f (−(−p), 0)
(O′ 7→ O1) = −f (p, 0)

(O′ 7→ O1) = −p′.

As in Figure 6 order of O1, O0 and O′ are similar for any other points, and so as |p| < |p′|, we
have

(O′ 7→ O1) = −p′
(O0 7→ O1) = p
|p| < |p′|





⇒ |(O′ 7→ O1)| < |(O0 7→ O1)|

this contradicts the intuition principle. Therefore the case of |p| < |p′| is not correct. Similarly
assumption of |p′| < |p| results in a contradiction. Hence, p′ = −p, or

f (p, 0) = −p.

(2)

Consequently, function f must have property (2). Therefore we have

(A 7→ B) = −(B 7→ A).

Now we obtain an important condition by Postulate 1. Consider O0, O1, O2 and A as the

following ﬁgure

we select O0 as the reference frame, so

We can select O1 as the reference frame, by postulate 1 we have

(O0 7→ O1) = p0
(O0 7→ A) = x0

(O1 7→ O2) = p1
(O1 7→ A) = x1

⇒ (O1 7→ A) = f (p0, x0) = x1.

⇒ (O2 7→ A) = f (p1, x1) = x2

from (3) and (4) we have

also

f (p1, f (p0, x0)) = x2 = (O2 7→ A)

(O0 7→ O1) = p0 ⇒

⇒ (O0 7→ O2) = f (−p0, p1)

(O1 7→ O0) = −p0
(O1 7→ O2) = p1



and so (O0 7→ A) = x0, therefore

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(O0 7→ O2) = f (−p0, p1)
(O0 7→ A) = x0

⇒ (O2 7→ A) = f (f (−p0, p1), x0) = x2.

by second postulate there are two points on an axis such that all points lie between and middle
them. We call right hand side point as N. For any point such as O we have (O 7→ N) = n.
Suppose that (O0 7→ O1) = p and O0 is the reference frame. Therefore

(O0 7→ O1) = p
(O0 7→ N) = n





⇒ (O1 7→ N) = f (p, n) = n.

Hence function f must have property (9). We summarize conditions of f as follows

f (x, y) = −f (−x, −y).

f (x, 0) = −x

f (f (x, y), z) = f (y, f (−x, z))

f (x, n) = n.

3 Finding Function f

In this section we present function f (x, y) with properties (10) up to (13). We propose the
following function which satisﬁes conditions (10) up to (12)

To obtain β we use condition (13), that is

thus

n − x
1 + βxn
n2 · Therefore the ﬁnal form of f is

= n

for this β = − 1

f (x, y) =

y − x
1 + βxy

·

f (x, n) = n

f (x, y) =

y − x
1 − xy

Remark. For n → ±∞ relation (15) is ordinary directed distance of x and y.

4 Examples

In this section we present some examples. In these examples we obtain relative distance of two

particular points.
Example 1. Consider three points O0, O1 and A as the following ﬁgure

r
A

what is (O1 7→ A)? From our notation we have

thus

And so

or

hence

(O0 7→ O1) = 2
(O0 7→ A) = 5



⇒ (O1 7→ A) = f (2, 5)

(O1 7→ A) =

(O1 7→ O0) = −2
(O1 7→ A) = 3n2




⇒ (O0 7→ A) = f (−2,

3n2

)

(O0 7→ A) =

3n2
n2−10 + 2
1 + 6n2

n2(n2−10)

=

5(n2 − 4)
n2 − 4

= 5

such that we expect.
Example 2. Suppose that N1 is a point near N, e.g., for O0 we have (O0 7→ N1) = n − ǫ,
for any positive and small ǫ. Does mentioned theorem in section 2 hold? In other words does
(N1 7→ N) = n? We have

(O0 7→ N1) = n − ǫ
(O0 7→ N) = n






⇒ (N1 7→ N) = f (n − ǫ, n)

(N1 7→ N) =

n − n + ǫ
n(n−ǫ)
1 −
n2

= n

that is a surprising result.
Example 3. What is point view of N from N? In this situation we have an ambiguity. On the
one hand, the distance of N from itself is zero and on the other hand this is n. Now by our
notations

(O0 7→ N) = n
(O0 7→ N) = n






8

⇒ (N 7→ N) = f (n, n)

or

(N 7→ N) =

n − n
1 − n2
n2

=

0
0

which we forecasted it by our ambiguity.
In the last example we show distance for N has no sense.
Example 4. Consider three points O0, O1 and N as follows

r
O0

n

ℓ

r

O1

r
N

what are (N 7→ O0) and (N 7→ O1)? we have

hence

and so

thus











(O0 7→ N) = n
(O0 7→ O0) = 0

⇒ (N 7→ O0) = f (n, 0)

(N 7→ O0) =

= −n

0 − n
1 − 0

(O0 7→ N) = n
(O0 7→ O1) = ℓ

⇒ (N 7→ O1) = f (n, ℓ)

(N 7→ O1) =

= −n.

ℓ − n
1 − nℓ
n2

Therefore point view of N from distance of O0 and O1 is the diﬀerence of (N 7→ O0) and
(N 7→ O1), or

Consequently distance for N has no sense.

−n + n = 0.

INTRODUCTION

A century ago,

it took the genius of James Clerk
Maxwell to unify electricity and magnetism into a pow-
erful theory: Classical Electrodynamics, constituted by
four basic equations that describe the evolution in space
and time of the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld
B. These equations, together with the Lorentz Force
Law, provide a complete description of electromagnetic
phenomena.

In 1990, F. Dyson[1] published an original proof given
by Feynman in 1948 of a pair of Maxwell equations (di-
vergenceless magnetic ﬁeld and Faraday’s law) and the
Lorentz Force Law. The motivation of Feynman was
to discover a new theory departing form simple assump-
tions, but the result was nothing but the same old theory,
and therefore, from his point of view, the proof was more
a failure than a success. Fortunately, the importance of
the proof was noticed by Dyson, and later on the work
was extended to non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds [2] and to the
relativistic domain [3].

Even though the proof is mathematically correct, it
require some clariﬁcation [4]. The proof is based on
two essential parts: 1) second Newton’s law, 2) the com-
mutator between components of position operator and
between position and velocity. There is an apparent in-
consistency in these assumptions since the ﬁrst is purely
classical while the second comes from a quantum theory,
however Bracken[5] remarked that it is possible to sub-
stitute the quantum commutators by classical Poisson
brackets.

It is worth noticing that in Dyson’s paper [1] the author
wrote: ”The proof begins with assumptions invariant un-
der Galilean transformations and ends with equations in-
variant under Lorentz transformations”. That would be
an amazing result, if true it deserves to be fully under-
stood or else it is desirable to know where the catch is.

relativity, which amounts to develop the following ideas,
so that the body of the paper will be devoted to the tech-
nical details. The ﬁrst point to remark is that Feynman’s
proof reproduces only the aforementioned homogeneous
Maxwell equations and the Lorentz force, which are in
fact compatible with Galilean relativity in 3+1 dimen-
sions. Thus, as far as we can see the logic of the proof is
the following.

• Galilean relativity is the basis of the formulation.

• Galilean invariance is enough to derive minimal
to introduce electromagnetic inter-

coupling, i.e.
actions.

• Newton’s second law and minimal coupling are con-
sistent with the Lorentz force and two homogeneous
Maxwell equations, provided the electric and mag-
netic ﬁeld transforms appropriately under boosts.

In order to make the paper as self contained as pos-
sible, we ﬁrst formulate Feynman’s proof, then we re-
view the basic ideas of the Galilei group, in particular
the role of the mass as a central extension of the algebra
is stressed as well as its relevance in the canonical quanti-
zation procedure. With these tools at hand we show that
the assumptions required in the proof are either derived
from the Galilei algebra or consistent with, in particu-
lar minimal coupling is discussed following the approach
by Levy-Leblond [6]. Requiring consistency of the whole
approach, we derive the transformations under boosts of
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

A. Feynman’s proof

Assume a particle exists with position xj (j=1,2,3) and

velocity ˙xj satisfying Newton’s Second Law

m¨xj = Fj(x, ˙x, t),

{xi, xj } = 0

m{xi, ˙xj } = δij.

(3)

Our aim is to argue why one should expect Feynman’s
result and to clarify the issue of Galilei versus Lorentz

with Poisson brackets

Then there exists ﬁelds E(x, t) and B(x, t) satisfying

The time evolution of B is obtained from the time

Fj = Ej + ǫjkl ˙xkBl,

together with Eq(3) and Eq(7) imply

which is equivalent to Eq(6).

End of proof.

{xl, {xj, Fk}} = 0,

(9)

while equation (7) allow us to conclude that

{xj, Fk} = −{xk, Fj},

(10)

and therefore, we can write

{xj, Fk} = −

ǫjklBl.

Eq(11) is the deﬁnition of B, which by virtue of Eq(8)
can be written as

Bl =

On the other hand Eq(9) can also be expressed as follows

{xj, Bl} = 0,

(13)

which means that B is only a function of x and t.

Deﬁning E by Eq(4), which guarantee the Lorentz
Force is correctly incorporated, and using Eqs(3, 11) and
Eq(13), it follows that E is only a function of x and t.

{xj, El} = 0,

Below we qualify Dyson’s statement ”The proof be-
gins with assumptions invariant under Galilean transfor-
mations” to show the role of the Galilei group in 3+1
dimensions.

II. GALILEI GROUP IN 3+1 D

The three dimensional Galilei group is deﬁned as the
ten parameter Lie group of the space time transforma-
tions of the form

x′ = R(θ, ϕ, ψ)x + vt + u
t′ = t + τ
where R is a SO(3) rotation matrix. The notation makes
it explicit that the group is generated by four subgroups,
with their canonical parametrization. The Lie algebra of
the three dimensional Galilei group is ordinarily referred
to a conventional basis consisting of ten generators (see
Table I).

(20)

Transformation
time translations (τ ),
space translations (ui),
boosts (vi),
rotations (R(θ, ϕ, ψ))

Generator

Moreover, using the expression for B, Eq(12) the Jacobi
identity :

TABLE I: Symmetry transformations and the associated gen-
erator.

ǫjkl { ˙xl, { ˙xj, ˙xk}} = 0.

can be cast in the form:

{ ˙xl, Bl} = 0,

which is equivalent to the Maxwell equation (5).

The corresponding Lie brackets are

[Ji, Jj] = iǫijkJk,

[Ji, Pj ] = iǫijkPk,
[H, Kj] = −iPj,

[Ji, Kj] = iǫijkKk,
[H, Ji] = 0,
[H, Pj ] = 0,

[Ki, Kj] = 0,

[Pi, Pj] = 0, [Ki, Pj ] = 0.

yields a vector operator Li (i = 1, 2, 3), which posses
exactly the same properties as Ji in Eq(22), therefore
the operators

Si = Ji − Li,

(i = 1, 2, 3)

(28)

commute with all the generators of the Lie algebra of
the group (H, Pi, Ki, Ji), but fail to commute with them-
selves since

[Si, Sj] = iǫijkSk.

(29)

Thus, Si can be interpreted as a translationally indepen-
dent contribution to the angular momentum, or spin.

Besides the central element I, another invariant of the

Galilei Lie algebra is

U = H −

P2
2m

,

(30)

which can be identiﬁed with the internal energy of the
system, and depends on internal dynamical variables in
such a way that U commute with X, P and S. The
second invariant of the algebra is the operator

S2 = (J − X × P)

2

.

(31)

In the momentum-space representation, the Lie alge-

bra now reads

H = U + P2

Pi = pi,

Ki = im ∂
∂pi
Ji = −iǫijkpk

− pit,

+ Si.





(32)

The second term in the right hand side of Ki is a trans-
lationally invariant contribution that can be inferred by
noticing that a boost is a translation that depends lin-
early on time.

In the classical limit, one recovers the Hamiltonian the-
ory deﬁned by the Poisson bracket (here z stands for
xi, pi):

{f, g} =

∂f
∂xi

∂g
∂pi

−

∂f
∂pi

∂g
∂xi

,

(33)

It is well known that the Galilei group posses a family if
nontrivial projective representations, which were studied
in great detail by L´evy-Leblond [6]. The projective rep-
resentations are found very simply: one adds to the right
hand sides of all commutation rules a central element I
with arbitrary coeﬃcients, and then, making appropriate
redeﬁnitions of the generators and using Jacobi identities
one arrives at the following brackets:

[Ji, Jj] = iǫijkJk,

[Ji, Pj] = iǫijkPk,
[H, Kj] = −iPj,
[Ki, Kj] = 0,

[Ji, Kj] = iǫijkKk,
[H, Ji] = 0,
[H, Pj ] = 0,

[Pi, Pj] = 0,

[Ki, Pj] = imδijI.

(22)

The one parameter family of the central extensions of
the algebra is characterized by a real number m, which
in physical systems is interpreted as the particle mass.

The localization properties of the system can be inves-
tigated looking for a position operator Xi (i = 1, 2, 3) in
the enveloping Galilei Lie algebra. The natural require-
ments an operator Xi must obey, in order to be identiﬁed
with the spatial position operator, are [6]:

1. A state localized at xi (eigenstate of Xi) transforms
under a translation by ui in a state localized at
xi + ui.
In other words, it requires the validity of
the commutation rule

[Xi, Pj ] = iδijI,

(23)

2. it should transform like a vector under spatial ro-

tations, or equivalently,

[Ji, Xj] = iǫijkXk.

(24)

3. An instantaneous (t = 0) boosts, must leave invari-

ant the position, i.e.

[Ki, Xj]|t=0 = 0.

(25)

These conditions are fulﬁlled by the operator:

Xi =

Once the relation between the boost generator and the
position operator is established, it is clear that the mass
as a central extension — last relation in Eq(22)— is the
classical relation [5] used to substitute the quantum com-
mutator in Feynman’s assumptions [1].

III. FEYNMAN’S PROOF AND GALILEAN

INVARIANCE

We are now ready to analyze the assumptions of Feyn-
man’s proof to the light of galilean relativity. The sec-
ond assumption (2) is an immediate consequence of the
classical limit of Eqs(25,26), which deﬁne the action of
instantaneous boosts (at t = 0) on the particle position

= {xi, xj} = 0.

(36)

The ﬁrst assumption, Eq(1), involves in fact two rela-

tions:

• Newton’s second law

Fi =

dπi
dt

(i = 1, 2, 3),

(37)

where πi (i = 1, 2, 3) is the kinematical momentum
of the particle, not necessarily equal to the canon-
ical momentum pi, and

• πi is related to the velocity of the particle ˙xi ac-

cording to

Fi =

= m

(i = 1, 2, 3),

(38)

dπi
dt

d ˙xi
dt

or equivalently

πi = m ˙xi + ci,

where c is a constant vector that can be absorbed
in the deﬁnition of πi:

πi = m ˙xi.

(39)

(40)

Notice that the relation between velocity and kinemat-
ical momentum Eq(40) severely restricts the form of the
Hamiltonian since we have

πi = m {xi, H} .

(41)

The connection of the third assumption Eq(3) with the
Galilei algebra goes through the position operator. How-
ever, in order to proceed we need to know the relation
between the canonical p and the kinematical momentum
π. The following argument due to L´evy- Leblond [6], pro-
vides the desired link.
Indeed, it is enough to demand
the existence of instantaneous boost transformations of
the momentum and position

pi → pi + mviI
xi → xi,

(42)

and postulate that the kinematical momentum trans-
forms in the same way, not only for the free particle,
but also in the case interactions are introduced

πi → πi + mviI.

(43)

4

In this case, the transformation of πi is noting but the
familiar velocity composition under a boost. As required,
Eqs(23,24,25) remain valid, and therefore, comparing
(42) and (43), we conclude that under a boost:

pi − πi → pi − πi,

(44)

thus, the functions Ai = pi − πi (i = 1, 2, 3) satisfy

{ki, Aj}|t=0 = m {xi, Aj} = m

= 0,

(45)

∂Aj
∂pi

that is, A is a function of x alone (and possibly of time).
Then, the relation between the canonical momentum and
the kinematical momentum is, using (40),

pi = πi + Ai(x, t) = m ˙xi + Ai(x, t).

(46)

This is nothing but minimal coupling, which has been
obtained from Galilei relativity plus plausible assump-
tions. A formal proof of this derivation can be found in
[8].

Now the third assumption, Eq(3), may be seen as a

consequence of (46) and the classical limit of (23)

{xi, pj} = {xi, m ˙xj} + {xi, Aj(x, t)}
= m {xi, ˙xj} = δij.

(47)

So far we heave shown that besides Newton’s second
Law, the hypothesis used by Feynman follow from the
3+1 dimensional Galilei algebra. In order to check the
consistency of the output we now investigate the trans-
formation laws for the Electric and Magnetic ﬁelds.

The transformation law under boosts for the diﬀeren-

tial operators follow from Eqs(20,42)

∂t′ = ∂

(51)

Therefore, Lorentz force Eq(4) transforms as:
dπ′

dt′ =

F ′
i =

On the other hand, according to the deﬁnition of B

and π, Eqs(12,40):

therefore the transformation law for the magnetic ﬁeld is

Finally, the transformation of the Electric ﬁeld, under

(52)

Thus, the Lorentz force and two Maxwell equations,
are consistent with Galilean relativity if the electric and
magnetic ﬁeld transform according to Eqs(43,48) and:

E′ = E − v × B,
B′ = B.

(53)

A ﬁnal comment before concluding. The transforma-
tions Eq(53) are not obtained from a non-relativistic
limit, a point risen long time ago[9].

• Appropriated transformations under boosts of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds exist such that the
Lorentz force and Maxwell equations are consistent
with Galilean relativity.

Thus, we conclude that Feynman’s proof are valid in
the framework of Galilean relativity, i.e. both the as-
sumptions as well as the conclusions (Lorentz force, Fara-
day’s law and divergenceless magnetic ﬁeld) are consis-
tent with Galilean transformations.

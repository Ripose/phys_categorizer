United Dipole Field

Vladimir F. Tamari∗

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The ﬁeld of an electromagnetic (E) dipole has been examined using general relativistic (R) and
quantum mechanical (Q) points of view, and an E=Q=R equivalence principle presented whereas the
curvature of the electromagnetic streamlines of the ﬁeld are taken to be evidence of the distortion
of spacetime, and hence of the presence of a gravitational ﬁeld surrounding the dipole. Using a
quasi-refractive index function N , with the streamlines and equipotential surfaces as coordinates,
a new dipole relativistic metric is described, replacing Schwarzschild’s for a point mass. The same
principle equates the curvature and other physical features of the ﬁeld with fundamental quantum
concepts such as the uncertainty principle, the probability distribution and the wave packet. The
equations of the dipole ﬁeld therefore yield the three ﬁelds emerging naturally one from the other
and uniﬁed without resorting to any new dimensions. It is speculated whether this model can be
extended to dipolar matter-antimatter pairs.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The quest for a uniﬁed theory of Electromagnetism
(E) Gravitational Relativity [R] and Quantum Mechan-
ics (Q) is hampered by the abstractness of quantum con-
cepts, compared to the other two. Feynman, in saying
that there is no physical ‘machinery’ causing quantum
eﬀects [1] accepts Born’s probabilistic interpretation of
quantum events [2]. This lack of physical reality had al-
ways bothered Einstein, who advocated that a successful
uniﬁcation entails “starting all over again” [3]. Super-
string uniﬁcation theory [4] does indeed start afresh, but
is not yet a complete theory, and there is still room to
search for diﬀerent starting points.

The present paper grew out of research in diﬀrac-
tion theory [5, 6], and no complete uniﬁcation theory
was attempted or is of course claimed from this elemen-
tary treatment. Nevertheless,
it was found that cer-
tain physical features of the electromagnetic dipole ﬁeld
could have intriguing quantum probabilistic interpreta-
tions. And when it was discovered, through general rel-
ativistic analysis of the streamline curvature, that the
dipole might also possess a gravitational ﬁeld, the ques-
tion arose whether the elements of a prototype uniﬁed
ﬁeld theory were now at hand.

The diﬀraction of a dipole-photon is examined in Sec-
tion II as a more exact form of the Huygens-Fresnel prin-
In Section III the equipotential surfaces φ, and
ciple.
the orthogonal streamlines S of a dipole ﬁeld are pro-

posed as the coordinates of a gµν relativistic metric sym-
metric around the dipole axis and plane only, replacing
the sphero-symmetric Schwarzschild metric for a parti-
cle: the severe curvature of the streamlines in the dipole
origin is interpreted as an indication of an unexpectedly
powerful gravitational ﬁeld there. This ﬁeld is character-
ized by a radial quasi-refractive index function N (R, θ)
of the distortion of spacetime. In Section IV the dipole
electric ﬁeld is shown to coincide with the Gaussian prob-
ability function while the dipole’s frequency and ampli-
tude attenuations follow those of a quantum wave packet.
An E=Q=R equivalence principle is stated in Section V,
and it is speculated in Section VI whether the dipole uni-
ﬁed ﬁeld model may be adapted to other particles than
the photon, perhaps through the concept of virtual pairs
of matter-antimatter, and whether the strong force could
be attributed to a dipole gravitational ﬁeld.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC DIPOLE
DIFFRACTION

Using intuitive hydrodynamical arguments, Tamari
has proposed that an expanding photon ﬁeld must have
both a foreword linear and a radial component [7], resem-
bling the bow wave of a boat. Miller [8] has shown that
Maxwell’s equations can yield a more exact form of the
Huygens-Fresnel principle for a point source, replacing it
by a dipole with a given spatio-temporal relation of the
phase and separation d of positive and negative charges
a, emitting a ﬁeld with wavelength λ0 = 2π/k, and with
a potential ﬁeld:

pleted in November 1993 but was not submitted for publication
anywhere. The 1993 paper and ﬁgures are presented here with no
changes, however necessary (except in the last sentence in Sec. III
and the deletion of the related equation). The paper is now being
revised and expanded. The fact that Einstein’s equations have a
solution for gravity waves emitted by a quadrupole but not a dipole
does not alter the conclusions of this paper since a quadrupole is a
linear addition of two dipoles. The help of D. de Lang in the tech-
nical aspects of this online publication is gratefully acknowledged.

Both the bow-wave and the spatio-temporal dipole
models of the photon have a characteristic geometry
of expanding nested near-circular equipotential surfaces
joined at the origin. For the sake of simplifying the anal-
ysis here, an approximate dipole ﬁeld is taken from the

literature [9] whereby, for a dipole of moment D = ad/4π
aligned with the z-axis and symmetrical about the origin,
with a time harmonic phase term H, the potential is:

as shown in Figure 1. These approximations also omit
the magnetic and quadrupole components. While Eq. 2
and Eq. 3 are symmetrical about the x
y plane, both the
bow-wave and the spatio-temporal dipole ﬁeld of Eq. 1
vanish in the

z regions.

The curvature of the dipole streamlines S, along which
the electromagnetic energy ﬂows, is also a feature seen
in Braunbek and Laukien’s [10] analysis of Sommerfeld’s
rigorous solution of diﬀraction around an inﬁnite half-
plane [11]. In Tamari’s Streamline Diﬀraction Theory [5]
the various curved diﬀracting streamlines inclined at an-
gles
2 carry all the Fourier components of
the ﬁeld [12] in a fan-shaped ﬂow pattern. Along the
+z axis the dipole streamline is straight and carries the
electromagnetic ﬁeld at a speed c, with equiphasals sep-
arated by the wavelength λ0. But what of all the other
curved S?

III. RELATIVISTIC DIPOLE GRAVITATION

By deﬁnition no energy ﬂows between streamlines, and
each curved S can be considered a unique pathway car-
rying light. But according to Einstein’s general theory of
relativity it is the presence of a gravitational ﬁeld that
causes a ray of light to bend [13]. Postponing for the
present the question of what the source of the dipole’s
gravitational ﬁeld would be, the geometry of the stream-
lines themselves is considered. Since they carry light, S

lines (S) towards increasing potential (φ): its tangential and
normal components point towards increasingly curved space-
time.

must be geodesics of the ﬁeld, i.e. following a minimum
path through the dipole’s spacetime [14]. Figure 2 illus-
trates the intuitive basis for regarding the dipole ﬁeld as
a gravitational ﬁeld. A new (φ, S, Q, t) coordinate sys-
tem based on Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 and symmetric about the
z-axis is therefore deﬁned, whereby, for a time t = 0, the
distance element is:

with all the other gµν = 0. The N term is to be explained
at length below. A full treatment using tensor algebra
proving that the gµν obey Einstein’s equations for gen-
eral relativity, and ﬁnding the curvature tensor gµνGµν
although essential, is beyond the scope of this paper. For-
tunately, there is a mathematically simple and exact de-
vice, which helps conceive the curvature of spacetime in
vivid physical terms.

In dynamics the curvature of the path of a particle
is evidence of acceleration, and hence a change in local
velocity. According to Einstein, “A curvature of rays of
light can only take place when the velocity of propagation
of light varies with position” [15], a rather problematic
statement because of the constancy of c in his relativity

as shown in Fig 3. In making these calculations Eq. 9
cannot be applied as it is because successive N1, and N2
segments share the same R but diﬀerent angles. There-
fore, from Eq. 2 and Eq. 9, and putting H = φ = D = 1
since they cancel out in Eq. 10:

theory. But as Eddington [16] explained, it is the “coor-
dinate velocity” v of light, which diminishes in the pres-
ence of a gravitational ﬁeld, and hence a quasi-refractive
index of spacetime N can be deﬁned where:

N =

c
v

(6)

Since the local velocity deﬁnes N , it is a measure of
both space contraction and time dilation, the more con-
ventional relativistic terms. Eddington, Lodge, and oth-
ers [17] used this concept of a variable density of space-
time, a gradient-index ﬁeld N , akin to that in geometrical
optics [18] to describe relativistic phenomena such as the
properties of a black hole.

The use of N transforms a relativistic coordinate
system into a classical one: At ﬁrst S are consid-
ered “straight” geodesics in the vacuum surrounding the
dipole. Alternately, the same S can be considered the
curved rays of light in a glass-like medium with a gradi-
ent index of refraction function N (R, θ). While the two
treatments in no way change the physical realities of the
ﬁeld, a variable speed of light v can now be unambigu-
ously deﬁned, and a geodesic can therefore be considered
the solution to the eikonal equation of geometrical op-
tics [18]:

N 2 = (

φ)2

(7)

∇
In the absence of masses or charges, N = 1, but in
gravitational ﬁelds light ‘slows down’ and N > 1, reach-
ing inﬁnity at the edge of a black hole.
In dynamics,
the curvature k of the path of a moving particle is re-
lated to its acceleration A = (dv/dt)t + kv2n, where t
and n are unit vectors tangent and normal to the path
respectively [20].
In the present case, A becomes the
gravitational acceleration, with its well-known relativis-
tic dependence on the curvature of space, as illustrated
in Figure 2. The streamline curvature k is derived from
the standard equation for line curvature, and from Eq. 3:

Since a dipole’s gravity causes the surrounding space to
curve, bending its own streamlines, then any other parti-
cle or ray will similarly experience the same gravitational
ﬁeld. Based on this intuitive but unproven assumption,
Eq. 10 and Eq. 11 were used to trace the path of various
rays V initiated at given points P (R, θ) and angles of in-
cidence I within the N ﬁeld. The path of the streamlines
S of Eq. 3, passing through a point P was conﬁrmed if
ﬁne angular increments < 0.1 deg were used to calculate
the refracted rays.

But what of the Schwarzschild [22] metric:

2GM/c2R), where G is the constant of uni-
with F = (1
versal gravitation? Here, instead of a dipole at the origin,
there is a mass M and space-time is distorted only radi-
ally. Putting ds = 0, the condition for a geodesic, and
dθ = 0 since the ﬁeld is spherically symmetric, an expres-
sion for the local ‘velocity’ v = dR/dt is obtained. And
using Eq. 6, this give a quasi-refractive index function
NsR for this metric [16]:

Ns =

1
F

(13)

indicating the ‘density’ of space-time due to a single point
mass at the origin, the expression for a point charge being
similar. Substituting Eq. 13 back into Eq. 12, this result
can be generalized for all metrics: Space contracts by
a factor of √N along streamlines (due to the change in
potential) and time dilates by √N −
1. But in the dipole
case N was derived from the (θ, S) coordinates, and does
not need to be included back in, which justiﬁes Eq. 4.

The asymmetry of the dipole metric, compared to
Schwarzschild’s is due to the presence of two opposite
charges at the origin. Another diﬀerence is that Ns =
∞
at the origin, but Nd has no singularities anywhere. Very
near the charges, the dipole potential, and hence the Nd
value gets quite complicated, and no longer follows that
of Eq. 2. In general, the local N value at a point P is ob-
tained by the the vector addition of the all electric ﬁelds
at P caused by surrounding dipoles in diﬀerent positions
and orientations.

IV. THE DIPOLE QUANTUM FIELD

Some of the dipole ﬁeld’s physical features will now be
interpreted from a quantum mechanical point of view.
But as Hawking has remarked, “[in quantum mechanics]
the unpredictable, random element comes in only when
we try to interpret the wave in terms of the positions
and velocities of particles. But maybe that is our mis-
take: maybe there are no particle positions and veloci-
ties, but only waves.” [23] And Schr¨odinger always had
reservations on the probabilistic interpretation of quan-
tum mechanics. [24] Adopting these views is necessary
here to justify the following physical interpretations:

4

A. The particle-wave duality

The dipole moment D is a quantum quantity since it
depends on the distance between the charges and their
quantiﬁed strength, and therein lies the ‘particle’ aspect
of the ﬁeld under consideration. The ‘wave’ aspect of the
ﬁeld is simply the time-harmonic classical dipole ﬁeld it-
self. This in no way disputes the results of quantum
mechanics, only the ‘causes’. For example, an intensity
distribution can be said to be the probabilistic accumu-
lation of many whole particle photons. Here the photon
will be described as a single continuous classical wave
with local intensity ﬂuctuations, which then cause ran-
dom particle events during absorption or emission, and
occurring within the sensor.

B. The uncertainty principle

∞

Heisenberg himself cited diﬀraction [25] as one illus-
tration of his uncertainty relations. But it will be ar-
gued here that uncertainty relations exist precisely be-
cause waves diﬀract. As in Figure 4, at the origin, the
dipole ﬁeld is basically concentrated in one point, so
∆x = 0, but the streamline directions carrying the ﬁeld’s
momentum p point in an inﬁnite number of directions,
hence ∆p =
. Very far from the origin, the streamlines
are basically parallel to the +z axis and ∆p = 0, but
. At
the wavefront has spread very widely and ∆x =
intermediate points ∆x and ∆p can be mathematically
related in several ways. For example, along any single
streamline, ∆p amounts to the curvature the streamline
(when the streamline is straight, ∆p = 0), while ∆x is
the distance element along the streamline. The physical
basis of Planck’s constant h in the relation ∆x∆p
h
is elusive, but must be sought in the relation between
charge quanta and the geometry of the dipole ﬁeld at the
origin.

C. The probability function

It is well known that

φ = E, the electric ﬁeld

strength, the vectorial version of N . Using an alterna-
tive derivation [26] for the dipole’s electric ﬁeld intensity
parallel to the z

axis, again with D = H = 1:

(14)

Putting 3 cos2 θ = 1 gives a cut-oﬀ angle Tw =
54.73 deg beyond which Ez = 0 and there is no foreword
momentum, as shown in Figure 1, where:

C = B tan Tw = 1.4139B

(15)

In Figure 5, the Ez values (normalized by an ampli-
2) of the dipole ﬁeld along z = B,

tude factor of 2.363B−

was compared to the Gaussian probability distribution,
related to the quantum probability function [27].

Where j = C/3 = 0.4713B, (the standard deviation, a
third of the signiﬁcant width before the curve dwindles
asymptotically to zero), was chosen so that the Gaussian
ﬁts over Ez(x). Figure 5 shows that there are only minor
. For
diﬀerences between P (x) and Ez(x) for

no energy reaches a screen at B, since all the streamlines
curve down before reaching it. What are the quantum
implications of such a ﬁeld, particularly the cut-oﬀ angle
C? The probability amplitude can be directly related
to the curvature of S: Increasing the curvature increases
the angle of incidence of S on B, and hence the smaller
the Ez vector.

D. The Wave Packet

In the case of a time-harmonic dipole, using Eq. 2 and
Eq. 9, and the fact that the wavelength is λ0 along the
+z axis, it was found that along the line z = B:

Ez(t=0) = cos

2πB

so that the equipotentials occur at ever-decreasing dis-
tances. In quantum mechanics, the photon ﬁeld is found
to comprise a wave packet, with a spectral function f (k)

5

specifying the inﬁnitely diminishing wavelengths and am-
plitudes ﬁtting within a Gaussian envelope [27]. It is seen
in Figure 5 how Ez(t=0) resembles such a function in all
details, as to amplitude and wavelength diminuation: as
the wave packet expands, the equiphasals intersect B and
S at ever shorter intervals, as in Fig. 1: there is a blue-
shift in the ﬁeld until the wavelength I(R, θ), and hence
v, becomes zero on the x axis.

V. E=R=Q PRINCIPLE

According to the analysis above, an electromagnetic-
relativistic-quantum-mechanical
equivalence principle
can now be generalized as follows: “in the ﬁeld sur-
rounding a system of electromagnetic charges, the gravi-
tational ﬁeld is equivalent to the curvature of the diﬀract-
ing streamlines, while the local quantum mechanical state
is equivalent to the gradient of the potential.”

This of course has only been examined in the single
case cited above, the ﬁrst-order dipole approximation of
Eq. 2. But other conﬁgurations produce curved stream-
lines, such as two point emitters of like charge, diﬀraction
through an aperture in an opaque screen, diﬀraction from
any continuous distribution of sources, and others.

VI. CONCLUSION

 

The electromagnetic dipole ﬁeld has been examined
from relativistic and quantum mechanical points of view,
with preliminary evidence that it makes up a uniﬁed ﬁeld
in which an E=Q=R equivalence principle can be as-
serted: The three ﬁelds here appear to emerge, one from
the other, in a satisfying and elegant way, and without
the need for any new dimensions. Can Dirac’s oppositely
charged virtual pairs of particles (matter-antimatter) [28]
be considered a kind of dipole, with electromagnetic,
gravitational and quantum ﬁelds such as those discussed
above? Is the atomic strong force the result of some kind
of short-range gravitational ﬁeld such as the one modelled
above? These are some of the questions that emerge from
the present study.

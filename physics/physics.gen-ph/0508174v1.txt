Physics textbooks assert that in the famous interferometer 1887 experi-
ment to detect absolute motion Michelson and Morley saw no rotation-
induced fringe shifts - the signature of absolute motion; it was a null
experiment. However this is incorrect. Their published data revealed
to them the expected fringe shifts, but that data gave a speed of some
8km/s using a Newtonian theory for the calibration of the interferom-
eter, and so was rejected by them solely because it was less than the
30km/s orbital speed of the earth. A 2002 post relativistic-eﬀects anal-
ysis for the operation of the device however gives a diﬀerent calibration
leading to a speed > 300km/s. So this experiment detected both abso-
lute motion and the breakdown of Newtonian physics. So far another
six experiments have conﬁrmed this ﬁrst detection of absolute motion in
1887.

Introduction

The ﬁrst detection of absolute motion, that is motion relative to space itself, was
actually by Michelson and Morley in 1887 [1]. However they totally bungled the
reporting of their own data, an achievement that Michelson managed again and
again throughout his life-long search for experimental evidence of absolute motion.
The Michelson interferometer was a brilliantly conceived instrument for the de-
tection of absolute motion, but only in 2002 [2] was its principle of operation ﬁnally
understood and used to analyse, for the ﬁrst time ever, the data from the 1887 experi-
ment, despite the enormous impact of that experiment on the foundations of physics,
particularly as they were laid down by Einstein. So great was Einstein’s inﬂuence
that the 1887 data was never re-analysed post-1905 using a proper relativistic-eﬀects
based theory for the interferometer. For that reason modern-day vacuum Michelson
interferometer experiments, as for example in [3], are badly conceived, and their null
results continue to cause much confusion: only a Michelson interferometer in gas-
mode can detect absolute motion, as we now see. So as better and better vacuum
interferometers were developed over the last 70 years the rotation-induced fringe
shift signature of absolute motion became smaller and smaller. But what went un-
noticed until 2002 was that the gas in the interferometer was a key component of

1

this instrument when used as an ‘absolute motion detector’, and over time the ex-
perimental physicists were using instruments with less and less sensitivity; and in
recent years they had ﬁnally perfected a totally dud instrument. Reports from such
experiments claim that absolute motion is not observable, as Einstein had postu-
lated, despite the fact that the apparatus is totally insensitive to absolute motion.
It must be emphasised that absolute motion is not inconsistent with the various
well-established relativistic eﬀects; indeed the evidence is that absolute motion is
the cause of these relativistic eﬀects, a proposal that goes back to Lorentz in the
19th century. Then of course one must use a relativistic theory for the operation
of the Michelson interferometer. What also follows from these experiments is that
the Einstein-Minkowski spacetime ontology is invalidated, and in particular that
Einstein’s postulates regarding the invariant speed of light have always been in dis-
agreement with experiment from the beginning. This does not imply that the use
of a mathematical spacetime is not permitted; in quantum ﬁeld theory the mathe-
matical spacetime encodes absolute motion eﬀects. An ongoing confusion in physics
is that absolute motion is incompatible with Lorentz symmetry, when the evidence
is that it is the cause of that dynamical symmetry.

2 Michelson Interferometer

The Michelson interferometer compares the change in the diﬀerence between travel
times, when the device is rotated, for two coherent beams of light that travel in
orthogonal directions between mirrors; the changing time diﬀerence being indicated
by the shift of the interference fringes during the rotation. This eﬀect is caused
by the absolute motion of the device through 3-space with speed v, and that the
speed of light is relative to that 3-space, and not relative to the apparatus/observer.
However to detect the speed of the apparatus through that 3-space gas must be
present in the light paths for purely technical reasons. A theory is required to
calibrate this device, and it turns out that the calibration of gas-mode Michelson
interferometers was only worked out in 2002. The post relativistic-eﬀects theory for
this device is remarkably simple. The Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect causes
the arm AB parallel to the absolute velocity to be physically contracted to length

caused by the gas also being in absolute motion). For the total ABA travel time we
then obtain

observed at D. If the interferometer is rotated in the plane through 90o, the roles of arms
AC and AB are interchanged, and during the rotation shifts of the fringes are seen in the
case of absolute motion, but only if the apparatus operates in a gas. By measuring fringe
shifts the speed v may be determined.

For travel in the AC direction we have, from the
Pythagoras theorem for the right-angled triangle in Fig.1 that (V tAC)2 = L2 +
(vtAC )2 and that tCA = tAC. Then for the total ACA travel time

only operate as a detector of absolute motion when not in vacuum (n = 1), namely
when the light passes through a gas, as in the early experiments (in transparent
solids a more complex phenomenon occurs and rotation-induced fringe shifts from
absolute motion do not occur). A more general analysis [2, 9, 10], including Fresnel

induced fringe drifts. The data for each 3600 full turn (the average of 6 individual turns) is
divided into the 1st and 2nd 1800 parts and plotted one above the other. The dotted curve
shows a best ﬁt to the data using (5), while the full curves show the expected forms using
the Miller direction for v and the location and times of the Michelson-Morley observations.
While the amplitudes are in agreement in general with the Miller based predictions, the
phase varies somewhat. This may be related to the Hick’s eﬀect [4] when, necessarily, the
mirrors are not orthogonal. We see that this data corresponds to a speed in excess of
300km/s, and not the 8km/s reported in [1], which was based on using Newtonian physics
to calibrate the interferometer.

meridian), while ψ is the azimuth of the absolute motion velocity projected onto
the plane of the interferometer, with projected component vP . Here the Fitzgerald-
Lorentz contraction is a real dynamical eﬀect of absolute motion, unlike the Einstein
spacetime view that it is merely a spacetime perspective artefact, and whose magni-
tude depends on the choice of observer. The instrument is operated by rotating at a
rate of one rotation over several minutes, and observing the shift in the fringe pat-
tern through a telescope during the rotation. Then fringe shifts from six (Michelson
and Morley) or twenty (Miller) successive rotations are averaged, and the average
sidereal time noted, giving in the case of Michelson and Morley the data in Fig.2,
or the Miller data like that in Fig.4. The form in (5) is then ﬁtted to such data,
by varying the parameters vP and ψ. However Michelson and Morley implicitly as-
sumed the Newtonian value k = 1, while Miller used an indirect method to estimate
the value of k, as he understood that the Newtonian theory was invalid, but had no
other theory for the interferometer. Of course the Einstein postulates have that ab-
solute motion has no meaning, and so eﬀectively demands that k = 0. Using k = 1
gives only a nominal value for vP , being some 8km/s for the Michelson and Morley
experiment, and some 10km/s from Miller; the diﬀerence arising from the diﬀerent
latitude of Cleveland and Mt. Wilson. The relativistic theory for the calibration of
gas-mode interferometers was ﬁrst used in 2002,[2].

3 Michelson-Morley Data

Fig.2 shows all the Michelson and Morley air-mode interferometer fringe shift data,
based upon a total of only 36 rotations in July 1887, revealing the nominal speed
of some 8km/s when analysed using the prevailing but incorrect Newtonian theory
which has k = 1 in (5); and this value was known to Michelson and Morley. In-
cluding the Fitzgerald-Lorentz dynamical contraction eﬀect as well as the eﬀect of
the gas present as in (5) we ﬁnd that nair = 1.00029 gives k2 = 0.00058 for air,
which explains why the observed fringe shifts were so small. We then obtain the
speeds shown in Fig.2.
In some cases the data does not have the expected form
in (5); because the device was being operated at almost the limit of sensitivity.
The remaining ﬁts give a speed in excess of 300km/s. The often-repeated state-
ment that Michelson and Morley did not see any rotation-induced fringe shifts is
completely wrong; all physicists should read their paper [1] for a re-education, and
indeed their paper has a table of the observed fringe shifts. To get the Michelson-
Morley Newtonian based value of some 8km/s we must multiply the above speeds
by k = √0.00058 = 0.0241. They rejected their own data on the sole but spurious
ground that the value of 8km/s was smaller than the speed of the earth about the
sun of 30km/s. What their result really showed was that (i) absolute motion had
been detected because fringe shifts of the correct form, as in (5), had been detected,
and (ii) that the theory giving k2 = 1 was wrong, that Newtonian physics had failed.
Michelson and Morley in 1887 should have announced that the speed of light did
depend of the direction of travel, that the speed was relative to an actual physical
3-space. However contrary to their own data they concluded that absolute motion
had not been detected. This bungle has had enormous implications for fundamental
theories of space and time over the last 100years, and the resulting confusion is only
now being ﬁnally corrected.

4 Miller Interferometer

It was Miller [4] who saw the ﬂaw in the 1887 paper and realised that the theory
for the Michelson interferometer must be wrong. To avoid using that theory Miller
introduced the scaling factor k, even though he had no theory for its value. He
then used the eﬀect of the changing vector addition of the earth’s orbital velocity
and the absolute galactic velocity of the solar system to determine the numerical
value of k, because the orbital motion modulated the data, as shown in Fig.5. By
making some 12,000 rotations of the interferometer at Mt. Wilson in 1925/26 Miller
determined the ﬁrst estimate for k and for the absolute linear velocity of the solar
system. Fig.4 shows typical data from averaging the fringe shifts from 20 rotations
of the Miller interferometer, performed over a short period of time, and clearly shows
the expected form in (5) (only a linear drift caused by temperature eﬀects on the
arm lengths has been removed - an eﬀect also removed by Michelson and Morley

shows the quality of the fringe data that Miller obtained, and is considerably better than the
comparable data by Michelson and Morley in Fig.2. The curve is the best ﬁt using the form
in (5) but including a Hick’s [4] cos(θ
β) component that is required when the mirrors are
not orthogonal, and gives ψ = 1580 , or 220 measured from South, and a projected speed of
vP = 351 km/s. This value for v is diﬀerent from that in Fig.2 because of the diﬀerence in
latitude of Cleveland and Mt. Wilson. This process was repeated some 12,000 times over
days and months throughout 1925/1926 giving, in part, the data in Fig.5.

and also by Miller). In Fig.4 the fringe shifts during rotation are given as fractions
of a wavelength, ∆λ/λ = ∆t/T , where ∆t is given by (5) and T is the period of
the light. Such rotation-induced fringe shifts clearly show that the speed of light is
diﬀerent in diﬀerent directions. The claim that Michelson interferometers, operating
in gas-mode, do not produce fringe shifts under rotation is clearly incorrect. But it
is that claim that lead to the continuing belief, within physics, that absolute motion
had never been detected, and that the speed of light is invariant. The value of ψ
from such rotations together lead to plots like those in Fig.5, which show ψ from the
1925/1926 Miller [4] interferometer data for four diﬀerent months of the year, from
which the RA = 5.2hr is readily apparent. While the orbital motion of the earth
about the sun slightly aﬀects the RA in each month, and Miller used this eﬀect
do determine the value of k, the new theory of gravity required a reanalysis of the
data [9, 11], revealing that the solar system has a large observed galactic velocity
of some 420
30km/s in the direction (RA=5.2hr, Dec= -67deg). This is diﬀerent
from the speed of 369km/s in the direction (RA=11.20hr, Dec= -7.22deg) extracted
from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy, and which describes a
motion relative to the distant universe, but not relative to the local 3-space (The
Miller velocity is explained by galactic gravitational in-ﬂows; see [12].)

month to month arises from the orbital motion of the earth about the sun:
months the vector sum of the galactic velocity of the solar system with the orbital velocity
and sun in-ﬂow velocity is diﬀerent. As shown in Fig.6 DeWitte using a completely diﬀerent
experiment detected the same direction and speed.

n = 1.000036, we ﬁnd that k2 = 0.00007. Until the refractive index eﬀect was taken
into account the data from the helium-mode experiments appeared to be inconsistent
with the data from the air-mode experiments; now they are seen to be consistent.
Ironically helium was introduced in place of air to reduce any possible unwanted
eﬀects of a gas, but we now understand the essential role of the gas. The data from
an interferometer experiment by Jaseja et al [7], using two orthogonal masers with
a He-Ne gas mixture, also indicates that they detected absolute motion, but were
not aware of that as they used the incorrect Newtonian theory and so considered
the fringe shifts to be too small to be real, reminiscent of the same mistake by
Michelson and Morley. The Michelson interferometer is a 2nd order device, as the
eﬀect of absolute motion is proportional to (v/c)2, as in (5).

1st Order Experiments

However much more sensitive 1st order experiments are also possible. Ideally they
simply measure the change in the one-way EM travel-time as the direction of prop-
agation is changed. Fig.6 shows the North-South orientated coaxial cable Radio
Frequency (RF) travel time variations measured by DeWitte in Brussels in 1991,
[9, 10, 11], which gives the same RA of absolute motion as found by Miller. That

experiment showed that RF waves travel at speeds determined by the orientation
of the cable relative to the Miller direction. That these very diﬀerent experiments
show the same speed and RA of absolute motion is one of the most startling dis-
coveries of the twentieth century. Torr and Kolen [8] using an East-West orientated
nitrogen gas-ﬁlled coaxial cable also detected absolute motion. It should be noted
that analogous optical ﬁbre experiments give null results for the same reason, ap-
parently, that transparent solids in a Michelson interferometer also give null results,
and so behave diﬀerently to coaxial cables.

Modern resonant-cavity interferometer experiments, for which the analysis lead-
ing to (5) is applicable, use vacuum with n = 1, and then k = 0, predicting no
rotation-induced fringe shifts.
In analysing the data from these experiments the
consequent null eﬀect is misinterpreted, as in [3], to imply the absence of absolute
motion. But it is absolute motion which causes the dynamical eﬀects of length
contractions, time dilations and other relativistic eﬀects, in accord with Lorentzian
interpretation of relativistic eﬀects. The detection of absolute motion is not incom-
patible with Lorentz symmetry; the contrary belief was postulated by Einstein, and
has persisted for over 100 years, since 1905. So far the experimental evidence is
that absolute motion and Lorentz symmetry are real and valid phenomena; abso-
lute motion is motion presumably relative to some substructure to space, whereas
Lorentz symmetry parameterises dynamical eﬀects caused by the motion of systems

9

through that substructure. To check Lorentz symmetry we can use vacuum-mode
resonant-cavity interferometers, but using gas within the resonant-cavities would
enable these devices to detect absolute motion with great precision. As well there
are novel wave phenomena that could also be studied, see [9, 10].

6 Conclusions

So absolute motion was ﬁrst detected in 1887, and again in at least another six
experiments over the last 100 years. Had Michelson and Morley been as astute as
their younger colleague Miller, and had been more careful in reporting their non-null
data, the history of physics over the last 100 years would have totally diﬀerent, and
the spacetime ontology would never have been introduced. That ontology was only
mandated by the mistaken belief that absolute motion had not been detected. By
the time Miller had sorted out that bungle, the world of physics had adopted the
spacetime ontology as a model of reality because that model appeared to be con-
ﬁrmed by many relativistic phenomena, mainly from particle physics, although these
phenomena could equally well have been understood using the Lorentzian interpre-
tation which involved no spacetime. We should now understand that in quantum
ﬁeld theory a mathematical spacetime encodes absolute motion eﬀects upon the el-
ementary particle systems, but that there exists a physically observable foliation of
that spacetime into a geometrical model of time and a separate geometrical model
of 3-space.

Abstract – The group-velocity of evanescent waves (in undersized waveguides, for

instance) was theoretically predicted, and has been experimentally veriﬁed, to be Super-

luminal (vg > c). By contrast, it is known that the precursor speed in vacuum cannot be
larger than c.
In this paper, by computer simulations based on Maxwell equations only,

we show the existence of both phenomena. In other words, we verify the actual possibility

of Superluminal group velocities, without violating the so-called (naive) Einstein causality.

1. – Introduction

A series of recent experiments, performed at Cologne[1], Berkeley[2], Florence[3] and

Vienna[4], revealed that evanescent waves seem to travel with a Superluminal group veloc-

ity (vg > c). This originated a lot of discussion, since it is known —on the other hand—
that the speed of the precursors cannot be larger than c. For instance, the existence of

Sommerfeld’s and Brillouin’s precursors (the so-called ﬁrst and second precursors) has

been recently stressed in refs.[5], while studying the transients in metallic waveguides.

In this paper we would like to address simultaneously both such problems, relevant

for the understanding of the propagation of a signal; namely, the question of the (Super-

luminal) value of vg in the evanescent case, and the question of the arrival time of the
transients (which implies a nonviolation of the so-called Einstein causality).

From a historical point of view, let us recall that for long time the topic of the electro-

magnetic wave propagation velocity was regarded as already settled down by the works of

Sommerfeld[6] and Brillouin[7]. Some authors, however, studying the propagation of light

pulses in anomalous dispersion (absorbing) media both theoretically[8] and experimen-

tally[9], found their envelope speed to be the group velocity vg, even when vg exceeds c,
equals ±∞, or becomes negative!
In the meantime, evanescent waves were predicted[10]

to be faster-than-light just on the basis of Special Relativistic considerations.

But evanescent waves in suitable (“undersized”) waveguides, in particular, can be

regarded also as tunnelling photons[11], due to the known formal analogies[12] between

the Schroedinger equation in presence of a potential barrier and the Helmholtz equation for

a wave-guided beam. And it was known since long that tunnelling particles (wave packets)

can move with Superluminal group velocities inside opaque barriers[13]; therefore, even

from the quantum theoretical point of view, it was expected[13,11,10] that evanescent

waves could be Superluminal.

In Sect.2 of this paper we shall ﬁrst show how the ﬁrst electric perturbation, reach-

ing any point P , always travels with the speed c of light in vacuum, independently of

the medium. Some comments will be added about the instant of appearance, and the

behaviour in time, of the Sommerfeld’s and Brillouin’s precursors. The results of a com-

puter simulation will be presented for free propagation in a dispersive medium, with the

precursors arriving before the (properly said) signal.

In Sect.3, however, we shall deal by further computer simulations (always based on

Maxwell equations only) with evanescent guided-waves, showing their group velocity to

be Superluminal.

2

Finally, in Sects.4 and 5 we shall deal with the transients associated with Superluminal

evanescent waves: a study that, to our knowledge, was not carried on in the past.

2. – Precursors and Causality

Every perturbation passes through a transient state before reaching the stationary

regime. This happens also when transmitting any kind of wave. In the case of electro-

magnetic waves, such a transient state is associated with the propagation of precursors,

arriving before the principal signal. This fact seems to be enough to satisfy the require-

ments of the naive “Einstein causality”.

In particular, when investigating the free propagation of an electromagnetic wave,

in a dispersive medium with resonances in correspondence with some discrete angular-

frequencies ωj, we can easily observe the arrival of the ﬁrst and second precursors, followed
by the arrival of the properly said signal. Let us consider for instance the motion in the

z direction of a harmonic beam, such that at z = 0 one has:

f (0, t) =

ds = eiωt for t ≥ 0

and f (0, t) = 0 for t < 0; where s is the complex integration variable, and γ > 0 in order

that the function be transformable. Let us then consider a dispersive medium whose

dielectric constant ε (electric permittivity) as a function of ω is

ε(ω) = 1 +

In the present model (initially proposed by Maxwell himself) aj is proportional to the
number of oscillators per unit volume, gj is the dissipation constant (due to molecular
collisions) and ω2

Since β(ω) → 1 when s → ±∞, one has to distinguish the case t − z/c < 0 from the
case t − z/c > 0.

In the former, the integration path in the complex plane can be closed

along an inﬁnite-radius semicircunference on the right side, where no singularities exist,

and the integral yields zero. In other words, one gets f (z, t) = 0 for t < z/c, in agreement

with Einstein causality.
has to evaluate expression (3) for t − z/c > 0;

In the latter case, to look for the mentioned precursors, one

this can be accomplished by applying

the stationary phase[15] method (which provides an illuminating understanding of the

question), following e.g. Brillouin’s[7] and Jackson’s[16] books. For example, the ﬁrst

precursor starts arriving at t = z/c as a very high frequency disturbance which grows

in amplitude but decreases in frequency with time. Its amplitude, after the maximum,

decreases till the arrival of the second precursor, which —when there is only a reso-

nance (j = 0) at ω = ω0, and g = 0— starts at time t = z
a maximum, and then decreases, while the oscillation angular-frequency tends to the ini-

afterwards (independently of the medium).

If we pass to consider, however, non-free propagation (in the vacuum) inside a wave

guide, when a cutoﬀ angular-frequency ωc enters the play, the stationary phase method ap-

plication is restricted by the fact that the propagation constant β(ω) = ω
becomes imaginary for ω < ωc. Nevertheless, if the beam contains also above-cutoﬀ spec-
tral components, then the ﬁrst precursor evaluation —which depends only on the highest

q

frequencies— are still possible, as shown, e.g., by Stenius and York[5]. We shall discuss

such problems in the next Section.

Here, let us just simulate the free propagation of an electromagnetic ﬁeld in a medium

described by eq.(2) with j = 0, i.e., described by

with a0 = 2.2 × 1010, ω0 = 4.4π × 1010, and g0 = −109. Let us assume the electric ﬁeld at
z = 0 to be f (0, t) = A t exp[−at2] sin(ωt) with A = 109 and a = 5 × 1017. Fig.1 shows
such a function of time (in ns) for ω = 7 GHz. The calculations then yield, for z = 63

m, the electric ﬁeld in Fig.2. For evidencing the Sommerfeld and Brillouin precursors, it
is necessary to magnify the vertical scale by a factor 104: see Fig.3, where the horizontal
axis is still the time axis (in ns). Fig.3 shows that the electric perturbation starts at

t = 210 ns, corresponding to the time needed to travel 63 m with speed c, when the ﬁrst

4

precursor starts arriving at z as a very high frequency ﬁeld (in fact, the stationary phase

method expects that immediately after t = z/c only the highest frequency components
contribute to the integral (3)). The second precursor starts reaching z at t ≃ 212.6 ns,

in perfect agreement —again— with the stationary phase solution. Afterwards, the ﬁeld

angular-frequency tends to ω = 7 GHz (stationary regime) and the properly said signal

starts arriving.

3. – Propagation below the cutoﬀ frequency

Let us come to the point we are more interested in, i.e., to the propagation in waveg-

uides of pulses obtained by amplitude modulation of a carrier-wave endowed with an

under-cutoﬀ frequency; and let us recall that the experiments —for instance— in refs.[1-

4] did actually detect in such a case a Superluminal group-velocity, vg > c (in agreement
with the classical[10] and the quantum[13] predictions).

For example, the work in refs.[1,17] put in particular evidence the fact that the seg-

ment of “undersized” (= operating with under-cutoﬀ frequencies) waveguide provokes

an attenuation of each spectral component, without any phase variation. More pre-

cisely, the unique phase variation detectable is due to the discontinuities in the waveguide

cross-section (cf. also refs.[13]). Mathematically[18], the spectrum leaving an undersized

the transfer function H(ω) = exp[iβL], with β(ω) = ω

waveguide segment (or photonic barrier ) is simply the entering spectrum multiplied by
1 − (ωc/ω)2/c. For ω > ωc,
the propagation constant β(ω) is real, and H(ω) represents a phase variation to be added

q

to the outgoing spectrum. However, for ω < ωc, when β(ω) is imaginary, the transfer
function just represents an additional attenuation of the incoming spectrum.

In a sense, the two edges of a “barrier” (undersized waveguide segment: see Fig.4)

can be regarded as semi-mirrors of a Fabry–Perot conﬁguration. The consequent negative

interference processes can lead themselves to Superluminal transit times. This points have

been exploited, e.g., by Japha and Kurizki[19] (who claimed the barrier transit mean-time

to be Superluminal provided that the coherence time τc of the entering ﬁeld ψin(t) is much
larger than L/c).

4. – Our numerical experiments

As already mentioned, to investigate the interplay between Einstein causality and the
fact that vg ≫ c when a signal is transported in a metallic waveguide by a carrier-wave

5

with ωw < ωc, one has to examine simultaneously the eﬀects mentioned in Sects.2 and 3.
Let us consider a signal obtained by a pulse-shaped amplitude modulation of a carrier-

wave with frequency fw (in Fig.5 the envelope of the wave is shown). Let us assume that
the carrier-wave is switched on at time t = 0, so that at the (undersized) waveguide

entrance (z = 0) the ﬁeld will be f (0, t) = 0 for t < 0. The amplitude of the carrier-wave

will reach a stationary state soon after the rise-time instant, tr (here deﬁned as the time
requested for the carrier amplitude to increase from 10% to 90% of its stationary value).

A (smoothly prepared) gaussian pulse, with width ∆t, be centered at t = tm,
(tm > tr).
(td > tm + ∆t), the carrier wave is switched oﬀ (and its amplitude will

decrease in a time of the order of tr). Wishing to reveal the precursors too, it is important
to use values of tr smaller than 100 ps (so to excite the higher frequency components with

that one can go on calculating the group-velocity via the standard relation vg = ∂ω/∂β.
A spectrally narrow pulse, moreover, allows us to examine the double barrier exper-

iment[20], i.e. the most interesting conﬁguration, without making recourse to external

ﬁlters. The setup is shown in Fig.6; the two photonic barriers are segments of under-
sized waveguide 25 and 50 mm long, respectively, with cross-section 23.45 × 34.85 mm2
and cutoﬀ frequency 4.304 GHz. Between them, there is another segment, 101 mm long,
of “normal-sized” waveguide, with cross-section 23.45 × 48.85 mm2 and cutoﬀ frequency
3.07 GHz. The transfer function, illustrated in Fig.7, was calculated by using a Fortran

program[21] based on the method of moments (MoM), while the mode decomposition was

performed in terms even modes TEm0, with m an odd number. As usual, the outgoing
spectrum was evaluated by multiplying the incoming spectrum (Fig.5) by the transfer

function, that is to say by use of the inverse Fourier transform (within the software pack-

age Mathematica 2.2.3).

It was chosen a carrier-wave with frequency fw = 3.574 GHz,
corresponding to a minimum of ∂φ/∂ν, where φ is the transfer-function phase. Let us

recall that the magnitude of the transfer function for this frequency is the attenuation suf-

fered by the electromagnetic wave along the two photonic barriers. The outgoing electric
signal is shown in Fig.8; in its inset (a) one can see the exact arrival time t ≃ 0.488 ns, at

the exit interface, of the ﬁrst electric disturbance (such an instant diﬀering a little from
the one, t = L/c ≃ 0.587 ns, predicted in Sect.2, since in our simulation we used of course

a ﬁnite “sample rate”, 0.4884 ns; by reducing ths rate, a better result is obtained).

In

inset (b) we see the entering gaussian pulse, initially modulated and centered at t = 800

ns.

In Fig.9(a) the pulse peak is represented in more detail. From its arrival time, t ≃

6

800.24 ns, we can derive the (Superluminal ) group-velocity vg = (176/0.24) mm/ns ≃
7.33 × 108 m/s ≃ 2.44 c.
If we want to evaluate the group-velocity by the relation
vg = ∂ω/∂β, we get (all the derivatives being evaluated at the frequency fw of the carrier-
wave):

in very good agreement with the previous value (their diﬀerence being smaller than 2%).

In the previous simulation we used a pulse half-width ∆ν = 12 MHz, so that, as required,
∆ν/fw ≃ 0.0034 ≪ 1.

Notice that the 0.24 ns spent by the pulse inside the setup of Fig.6 is due to the wave

phase variation caused by the geometric discontinuities existing between the diﬀerent

waveguide segments which compose the analyzed setup (mainly the leading edges of the

barriers): we shall come back to this point. One can therefore expect[22] such a transit

time to be independent not only of the length of the barriers (Hartman eﬀect: see refs.[13]),

but even of the length of the “normal” waveguide inserted between the two barriers. This

has been experimentally veriﬁed[20], and constitutes the most interesting fact revealed by

refs.[1,17,20].

We repeated our computer simulation for the same setup depicted in Fig.6, when inserting

between the undersized waveguides (barriers) a segment of “normal” waveguide 501 mm

(instead of 101 mm) long; with a new, suitable choice of the carrier frequency (fw = 3.5795
GHz). The new pulse can be seen in Fig.9(b). The delay (transit time) resulted to

be 0.336 ns, corresponding to a higher (Superluminal) group-velocity, vg = (576/0.336)
mm/ns ≃ 17.14 × 108 m/s ≃ 5.71 c. Again, by using the standard deﬁnition, we obtain
the very close value

vg =

≃ 5.91 c ,

(4’)

their diﬀerence being less than 3.4%. Let us notice that the considered setup (Fig.6)

works as a Fabry–Perot ﬁlter, so that, when the length L2 of the intermediate (“normal-
sized”) waveguide increases, the usable band width decreases. Of course, if we had chosen

a carrier frequency outside the suited intervals, e.g. fw = 5.58945 GHz (non-evanescent
case), we would have got a subluminal group-velocity. In fact, our calculations yield in

this case that the outgoing pulse (see Fig.9c) is centered at t = 0.977 ns, corresponding
to the group-velocity vg = (176/0.977) mm/ns ≃ 0.6 c.

5. – The case of an inﬁnite undersized waveguide.

Let us stress once more that all the delays (non-zero transit times) found above,

in our simulations of experiments, depend only on the phase variation suﬀered by the

wave because of the geometric discontinuities in the waveguide. Actually, as already

mentioned, the propagation constant β(ω) is imaginary for the under-cutoﬀ frequencies, so

that the transfer function H(ω) works only as an attenuation factor for such (evanescent)

frequencies. However, the higher (non-evanescent) frequencies will be phase shifted, in
such a way that β(ω) will tend to its free-space value ω/c for ω → ∞. In other words,

the higher spectral components travel with speed c; they are the responsible both for

the ﬁnite speed of the evanescent beams, and for the appearance of the precursors.

[In

the (theoretical) case that a pulse were constituted by under-cutoﬀ frequencies only, the

situation could therefore be rather diﬀerent].

Anyway, let us eliminate the eﬀect of the geometric discontinuities just by considering

an electromagnetic signal which is already propagating inside an under-sized waveguide,

and travelling between two parallel cross-sections separated by the distance L. The
waveguide size be 5 × 10 mm2, and L = 32.96 mm (cf.Fig.10). The entering signal
envelope is shown in Fig.11 as a function of time; the (smoothly prepared) gaussian

pulses are centered at tm = 100, 170, 240 and 300 ns, respectively.
part (in time) of the mentioned envelope is shown, while in inset (b) one can see the peak

In inset (a) the initial

of the gaussian pulse centered at 100 ns. After having travelled the considered distance

L through the undersized waveguide (characterized by the transfer function depicted in

Fig.12), the evanescent signal arrives with the envelope shown in Fig.13. The shape is

essentially the same (cf. also inset (b) of Fig.13), even if the amplitude is of course

reduced.

In inset (a) of Fig.13 one can see the initial part (in time) of the transmitted

signal, arriving after 109.87 ps, which is exactly the time needed to travel 32.96 mm with

the speed c of light in vacuum. However, by comparing insets (b) of Figs.11 and 13, one

deduces that the pulses travelled with inﬁnite group-velocity, since the transmission of

the pulse-peaks required zero time (instantaneous transmission).

It is interesting also to analyze the spectra of the entering (Fig.14) and arriving

(Fig.15) signal. Fig.14 shows the Fourier transform of the signal presented in Fig.11,

when it modulates in amplitude a carrier-wave with frequency 14.5 GHz.

In the insets

of Figs.14 and 15, we show the signal spectrum after magnifying the vertical scale by
a factor 3 × 104; we can notice that the arriving signal possesses a spectral component
(approximately centered at 15 GHz) that was not present in the entering spectrum: such

8

a new component corresponds to the waveguide cutoﬀ value, 15 GHz in this case.

After the transients, the real signal arrives, with a Superluminal (even inﬁnite) group-

velocity.

6. – Conclusions.

At this point, one can accept that a signal is really carried (not by the precursors,

but) by well-deﬁned amplitude bumps, as in the case of information transmission by the

Morse alphabet, or the transmission of a number e.g. by a series of equal (and equally

spaced) pulses.

In such a case, we saw above that the signal can travel even at inﬁnite

speed, in the considered situations. It is important also to notice, when comparing Fig.13

with Fig.11, that the width of the arriving pulses does not change with respect to the

initial ones. The signal, however, cannot overcome the transients, “slowly” travelling

with speed c.

Even if the AM signal were totally constituted by under-cutoﬀ frequencies, when the

experiment is started (e.g., by switching on the carrier wave) one does necessarily meet a

transient situation, which generates precursors.

One might think, therefore, of arranging a setup (permanently switched on) for which

the precursors are sent out long in advance, and waiting afterwards for the moment at

which the need arises of transmitting a signal with Superluminal speed (without violat-

ing the naive “Einstein causality”, as far as it requires only that the precursors do not

travel at speed higher than c). Some authors, as the ones in refs.[1,17,20], do actually

claim that they can build up (smooth) signals by means of under-cutoﬀ frequencies only,

without generating further precursors: in such a case one would be in presence, then, of

Superluminal information transmission.

However, on the basis of our calculations (which imply the existence also of above-

cutoﬀ frequencies in any signal: cf. the inset of Fig.14) this does not seem to be true in

practice.

If, in reality, to start sending out a signal means to create some discontinuities

(i.e., to generate new precursors), and if the signal cannot bypass the precursors (even

when the carrier was switched on long in advance), then information could not be trans-

mitted faster than light by the experimental devices considered above, in spite of the fact

that evanescent signals travel with Superluminal group-velocity.

Such critical issues deserve further investigation, and we shall come back to them else-

where (for instance, a problem is whether one must already know the whole information

content of the signal when starting to send it; in such a case, it would become acceptable

9

the mathematical trick of representing any signal by an analytical function[23]). But we

have seen that, in any case, the evanescent modes travel for some distance with faster-

than-light speed; and at least in three further sectors of experimental physics Superluminal

motions might have been already observed[24]. Therefore, it is worthwhile to recall here,

in this regard, that Special Relativity itself can, and was, extended[25] to include also

Superluminal motions on the basis of its ordinary postulates; solving seemingly also the

known causal paradoxes[26] associated in the past with tachyonic motions.

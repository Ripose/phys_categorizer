Abstract
We examine a particular kind of six-dimensional Cremonian universe featuring one dimension of space,
three dimensions of time and other two dimensions that cannot be ranked as either time or space. One of
these two, generated by a one-parametric aggregate of (straight-)lines lying on a quadratic cone, is more
similar to the spatial dimension. The other, represented by a singly-parametrical set of singular space
quartic curves situated on a proper ruled quadric surface, bears more resemblance to time. Yet, the two
dimensions diﬀer profoundly from both time and space because, although being macroscopic, they are
not accessible to (detectable by) every Cremonian observer. This toy-model thus demonstrates that there
might exist extra-dimensions that need not necessarily be compactiﬁed to remain unobservable.

There are a number of features of the macroscopic physical world that still remain substantially
beyond grasp of theoretical physics. Among them, the non-trivial structure of time and the ob-
served dimensionality of the universe obviously represent a case in question. As we found [1,2]
and have repeatedly stressed [3–5], the two properties seem to be intimately intertwined and ask,
therefore, for a conceptually new approach to be properly understood. A (very promising) piece
of such a formalism is undoubtedly the concept/theory of Cremonian space-times [6–14].

The Cremonian picture of space-time is indeed remarkable in several aspects. The ﬁrst, and
perhaps most notable, fact is that without employing any concept of metric (measure), this ap-
proach fundamentally distinguishes the time dimension(s) from spatial ones and, in its most trivial
form, it straightforwardly leads to their observed number (4) and respective ratio (1+3) as well
[6,7,9,10]. Second, it demonstrates that these dimensions are not primordial, but emerge from
more fundamental algebraic geometrical structures [13]. Third, it indicates that the universe with
the inverse signature might evolutionary be intimately connected with our universe [12]. And last,
but not least, when the observer (subject) is concerned, it qualitatively reproduces our ordinary
perception of time as well as a whole variety of altered/non-ordinary forms of mental space-times
[10,15]; moreover, every observer in this basic Cremonian universe is found to face an intricate 2+1
break-up among the space dimensions themselves [14].

In this paper, we introduce and examine a particular kind of a more complex, six dimensional
Cremonian universe whose spatio-temporal sector is still four dimensional, yet featuring three di-
mensions of time and just a single spatial coordinate. The character of other two dimensions
is neither that of space nor time; in addition, these dimensions are only conditionally observ-
able/accessible. This Cremonian universe sits in the 3-dimensional projective space over the ﬁelds
of the real numbers ℜ and is generated by the conﬁguration of fundamental elements of a homa-

Our forthcoming task is to ﬁnd the fundamental elements of W(ηα). To begin with, we recall
[6,16] that the fundamental element of a Cremona transformation between two 3-dimensional
projective spaces is a curve, or a surface, in one space whose corresponding image in the other
space is a single point;1 the loci of fundamental elements of the same kind being mapped, in general,
into curves, i.e., one-dimensional geometrical objects, of the second space. Employing Eqs.(11)–
(14), it is quite a straightforward task to spot that in our present case the loci of such elements are
L, the quadric D=0 and the quadratic cone C=0, for
the plane of the conic
their images in the second space are indeed curves, namely lines (for the planes and the quadric)
Q host a pencil (i.e.,
and/or a twisted cubic (for the cone) [17]. To be more explicit, the plane of

ﬁnds that the two conﬁgurations are prefect inverses of each other; it was, among other things, also
this feature that motivated us to examine thoroughly this particular kind of Cremonian universe.
Now we turn to quadratic loci of fundamental elements. The quadric D=0, which is proper (i.e.,
non-composite) and ruled (i.e., containing inﬁnity of lines), accommodates a single parametrical
aggregate of fundamental quartics, i.e., curves of order four,

At this point we invoke our fundamental “Cremonian” postulate [6–10] which says that each
single parametrical sets of fundamental elements generates/represents a unique dimension of a
Cremonian universe, with pencil-borne aggregates having a special status of generating space (lines)
and time (conics). Hence, the Cremonian universe under discussion is six-dimensional, with three

these two “extra-”dimensions. This diﬀerence stems from the fact that the former are all planar
conﬁgurations, whereas the latter are both located on quadratic surfaces, and acquires its most
pronounced form when a particular Cremonian observer is concerned. For a Cremonian observer

is represented by a line [10,14,15], and whilst any line in a three-dimensional projective space is
incident with any plane (see, e.g., Refs. [18,19]), this is no longer the case for a pair comprising a
line and a non-composite quadric; given any non-composite quadric (whether proper, or a cone),
there exist an inﬁnite number of lines incident with it, but also an inﬁnity of lines which have no
intersection with this quadric. If we take this incidence relation as a synonym of the observer’s
awareness of the particular dimension, then we see that the four “planar” dimensions (i.e., time
and space) will be observed by (accessible to) every observer, while the two “quadratic” ones not!
In other words, for each of these two non-planar dimensions, there exist two distinct groups of the
observers; one comprising observers who perceive this dimension, the other those who do not. This
ﬁnding thus amounts to saying that these two extra-dimensions are observable only conditionally.
It is of crucial importance to realize here that the conditional observability of these extra-
dimensions has nothing to do with their length (compactiﬁcation), as no concept of the mea-
sure/metric has so far been introduced into our model. Instead, it is of a purely algebraic geo-
metrical origin, based solely on the incidence relations between relevant geometrical objects and
intimately linked with the fact that the ground ﬁeld of the background projective space, taken to
be that of the real numbers, is not algebraically closed; for the geometrical problem of ﬁnding the
common points of a line and a quadric in a 3-dimensional projective space deﬁned over a given
ground ﬁeld reduces to the algebraic one of solving/factoring a quadratic equation in the given
ﬁeld, which is not always possible unless the ﬁeld is algebraically closed (see, e.g., Ref. [20]). This
toy-model thus demonstrates that there might exist extra-dimensions that need not necessarily be
compactiﬁed/curled-up to remain unobservable. And this is a truly serious implication, especially
for cosmology and high energy particle physics.

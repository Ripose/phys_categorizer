AN ASYMMETRY IN THE MAXWELL EQUATIONS

J. TOWE

Abstract. A term in the Maxwell-Ampere law describes a linear displacement
current in the absence of a conductor. Symmetry therefore calls for a term in
the Faraday-Lenz law, which in the absence of a conducting coil, would describe
a loop of displacement current about a linear increment of magnetic ﬂux. This
term, introduced to satisfy symmetry, predicts a physical phenomenon that
has recently been observed.

1. The Faraday-Lenz and Maxwell-Ampere Laws

The third Maxwell equation is

(1.1)

(1.2)

This is the Faraday-Lenz law, which can be regarded as describing an electric
ﬁeld that is induced along a conducting coil by a changing magnetic ﬂux that is
symmetrically enclosed by that coil. Due to the negative sign on the right side of
Equation 1.1, the direction of the curl of the electric ﬁeld is reversed. The fourth
Maxwell equation is

integral of the dot product
law, which describes the right-handed curl of a magnetic ﬁeld about the linearly
directed electric current µ0ienc, and about the displacement current µ0ǫ0
(a
virtual current that occurs in the absence of a conductor and generates a magnetic
ﬁeld). The constants of proportionality µ0 and ε0 are the familiar permeability and
dΦE
permittivity constants. The term µ0ǫ0
dt , which describes Maxwell’s virtual or
displacement current was introduced to satisfy symmetry, but was experimentally
conﬁrmed.

2. A New Term Dictated by Symmetry

It is now argued that the above described equations collectively involve an asym-
metry that is due to the absence of a term on the left side of the Faraday-Lenz law
(1.1). This term would describe a loop of displacement current about a linear in-
crement dΦB
dt of magnetic ﬂux in the absence of a conducting coil. According to
conventional theory, the Faraday-Lenz law would be degenerate in the absence of a
conducting coil, but symmetry and the existence of Maxwell’s displacement current
combine to argue that a loop, or series of loops of virtual current (a loop or series
of loops of displacement current) does symmetrically enclose a linear increment of

magnetic ﬂux in the absence of a conducting coil. Speciﬁcally such considerations
argue for the addition of a term

to the left side of the Faraday-Lenz law (Equation 1.1). As in the introduction of
the term

to the right side of the Maxwell-Ampere law, the addition of the term (2.1) to the
left side of the Faraday-Lenz law is to satisfy symmetry; but as in the former case,
the addition of the term (2.1) predicts a phenomenon that can be experimentally
conﬁrmed.

3. Physical Prediction of the Proposed Term

In paramagnetic materials such as water, each molecule is characterized by a net
permanent magnetic dipole moment. In the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld,
the magnetic dipole moments of the individual molecules align with the external
ﬁeld. In this context let us consider the molecules of a river that is ﬂowing from
north to south.
In this context the magnetic dipole moments of the individual
molecules align with the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, so that the paramagnetic sample of
N molecules that is represented by the river produces a magnetic dipole moment of
magnitude N µ (where µ represents the magnetic dipole moment of an individual
molecule). Thus the north to south ﬂow of the river produces an eﬀect that is
equivalent to the motion of a large bar magnetic, which is moving, north pole
leading, toward the south.
If the proposed term (2.1), that (in the absence of
a conducting coil) describes a loop of displacement current about the time rate
of change of an actual magnetic ﬂux, is correct, then the ﬂow of the river, which
generates an increment dΦB
dt of magnetic ﬂux, should produce a loop of displacement
current that is orthogonal to the ﬂow of the river; i.e. the ﬂow of the river should
−→
E virtual, that is anti-parallel to the
produce a curl of a virtual electric ﬁeld,
ﬂow of the river.
In this context let us consider a linear object consisting of a
ferromagnetic material and therefore associating with a weak magnetic ﬁeld. If this
ferromagnetic object is prepared by exposure to the magnetic ﬁeld of the earth (so
that the magnetic ﬁeld that is generated by the ferromagnetic material is aligned
with the magnetic ﬁeld of the earth), and if this object is then exposed to the area
above the north-south ﬂow of a river and oriented so that it lies in a plane that is
parallel to that of the ﬂowing river, then this linear object of ferromagnetic material
should (if the fulcrum is appropriately placed) experience a torque that tends to
anti-align the object with the north to south ﬂow of the river. This prediction was
recently conﬁrmed by D. Couillard.

where the proposed modiﬁcation is described by the second term on the left side of
the Faraday-Lenz law (Equation 3.3). Again this term describes a loop of displace-
ment current in the absence of a conducting coil, which is generated by a linear
increment of magnetic ﬂux dφB
dt .

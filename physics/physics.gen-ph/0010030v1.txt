Abstract

Having based on the analysis of Pietronero and collaborators the galaxy number
counts can be considered as an evidence of that the geometry of the universe is euclidean
and that the K-corrections are absent. In such a universe measuring the cosmological
redshift of the object and measuring the ﬂux from the object are inconsistent. It is
considered the model of the universe which describes the above properties.

Authors of [1],[2] claimed that galaxies have a fractal distribution with constant D ≈ 2 up
to the deepest scales probed until now 1000 h−1 Mpc and may be even more. They showed
that modiﬁcation of the euclidean geometry and the K-corrections are not very relevant in
the range of the present data. The use of K-corrections leads to the unstable behaviour
of the number counts, with fractal dimension D increasing systematically to substantially
larger values as a function of the depth of the volume limited sample. Quantitatively this
behaviour can be explained as the eﬀect of K-corrections applied to an underlying galaxy
distribution with fractal dimension D ≈ 2. The use of the FRW geometry instead of the
euclidean geometry is equivalent to an eﬀective K-correction. So similar to the use of K-
corrections the use of the FRW geometry leads to the unstable behaviour of the number
counts as a function of depth.

The number counts can be considered as an evidence of that the geometry of the universe
is euclidean rather than FRW and that the K-corrections are spurious. Let us study the uni-
verse with euclidean geometry. It should be noted that here euclidean geometry is conceived
as a real background of the universe not as an approximation of the FRW geometry.

In the euclidean geometry, the radial distance r and the angular diameter distance rθ are

the same and are given by

The luminosity distance is given by

From this it follows that the intrinsic luminosity of the object L and the observed ﬂux F are
related as

Two factors 1 + z are due to the increase of the scale factor. The third factor 1 + z is due
to the decrease of the frequency of photon. The fourth factor 1 + z is due to that the time
goes faster. The two of four factors 1 + z are absent in the case of euclidean geometry. This
is natural to interprete such that the scale factor grows, the frequency of photon is constant,
and the ﬂow of time is constant. Since the frequency of photon is constant, K-corrections
are absent. Thus in the universe with the euclidean geometry the K-corrections are absent.
We arrive at the situation where there are two inconsistent types of observations. The
ﬁrst, when the scale factor do not grow with time a = const, and the clock goes faster
with time ∆t ∝ 1 + z and correspondingly the frequency of photon decreases with time
ω ∝ (1 + z)−1. The second, when the scale factor grows with time a ∝ 1 + z, and the
clock goes persistent with time ∆t = const and correspondingly the frequency of photon
is constant with time ω = const. Below we consider the model of the universe with such
properties.

In the FRW model [3], the universe is considered in the system accompanying to the
matter of the universe. On the contrary, let us consider the universe in the laboratory system.
It should be stressed that here we consider the model of the universe in the laboratory system
not as an approximation of the FRW model but as a real one. Let the universe be close.
The total mass of the close universe in the laboratory system is equal to zero. Hence, when
considering the close universe in the laboratory system, the gravity (matter) of the universe
do not deﬁne the evolution of the universe.

So we consider the close universe in the laboratory system. Let the scale factor of the

universe be equal to the size of the horizon at every moment of time

a = ct.

(5)

The law (5) can be treated in two ways. The ﬁrst, the clock goes persistent with time
∆t = const, and the scale factor of the universe grows with time a ∝ t. The second, the
scale factor is constant with time a = const, and the clock goes faster with time ∆t ∝ t. Thus
it is impossible to deﬁne simultaneously the growth of the scale factor and the acceleration
of the ﬂow of time. The evolution of the universe can be expressed either as a growth of the
scale factor or as an acceleration of the ﬂow of time. Hence there are two inconsistent types
of observations.

Measuring the cosmological redshift of the object corresponds to the second type. In this
case the scale factor of the receiver and the scale factor of the emitter are the same ar = ae.
The clock of the receiver goes faster than the clock of the emitter ∆tr = ∆te(1 + z), and the
spectral line of the receiver is redshifted from the spectral line of the emitter ωe = ωr(1 + z).
Measuring the photon ﬂux from the object through the photometric band corresponds
to the ﬁrst type. In this case the scale factors of the receiver and the scale factor of the
emitter are related as ar = ae(1 + z). The clock of the receiver and the clock of the emitter
go concurrently, and the frequency of photon for the receiver and for the emitter is the
same ωr = ωe. Hence the observed ﬂux is a function of redshift F ∝ r−2
θ (1 + z)−2, and the
K-corrections are absent.

Thus describing the universe in the laboratory system we come to the conclusion that
the geometry of the universe is euclidean and that the K-corrections are absent. This is in
It should be noted that there is no
agreement with the observed galaxy number counts.

description of the universe. So the number counts can be considered as an evidence in favour
of the use of the laboratory system for description of the universe.

The observed behaviour of the number counts is D ≈ 2. Description of the universe
in the laboratory system leads to the fractal structure D = 2 [4]. Sketch how the fractal
structure arises in this case. So we consider the close universe in the laboratory system. For
the close universe the mass of the matter is equal to the energy of selfgravity

From this substituting the law (5) it follows that the scale of mass grows with time

Let photon be emitted from the centre of the laboratory system. Then the motion of
photon deﬁnes the distance R = ct. Since the scale of mass grows with time, it grows with
the distance from the centre of the laboratory system m ∝ t ∝ R. The number of the
particles of the mass M within radius R is given by

N(< R) =

ρR3
M

∝ R2.

Thus the growth of the scale of mass with time deﬁnes the fractal structure of the universe.

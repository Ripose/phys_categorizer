Abstract

2

Classical relativistic ﬁeld theory is applied to perfect and magneto-
hydrodynamic ﬂows. The ﬁelds for Hamilton’s principle are shown
to be the Lagrangian coordinates of the ﬂuid elements, which are
potentials for the matter current 4-vector and the electromagnetic
ﬁeld 2-form. The energy momentum tensor and equations of motion
are derived from the ﬁelds. In this way the theory of continua is shown
to have the same form as other ﬁeld theories, such as electromagnetism
and general relativity.

Waves are treated as an example of the power of ﬁeld theoretic
methods. The average or background ﬂow and the waves are con-
sidered as two interacting components of the system. The wave-
background interaction involves the transfer of energy and momen-
tum between the waves and the average ﬂow, but the total energy
and momentum are conserved. The average Lagrangian for the total
wave-background system is found by expanding the Lagrangian about
the background ﬂow and averaging over the phase. The total energy-
momentum tensor is constructed, and the conservation of energy and
momentum are discussed. Varying the wave amplitude gives the dis-
persion and polarization relations for the waves, and varying the phase
gives the rays and conservation of wave quanta (or wave action). The
wave quanta move with the group velocity along the bi-characteristic
rays.

Part I
Field Theory for Fluids

1 Introduction

The theory is both Lorentz and generally covariant on space time M, so the
physical and geometric quantities are independent of the coordinate system,
i.e. they are tensor ﬁelds. We use coordinate free notation, and units so that
the speed of light = 1. The natural mathematical framework is diﬀerential
geometry [2, 7, 9].

The theory is introduced in Part 1 and is applied to waves in Part 2.
Relativistic thermodynamics is discussed in §2. In §3 the Lagrangian coordi-
nates are shown to be the three scalar ﬁelds for Hamilton’s principle. They

3

are also the potentials for the matter current 4-vector and the electromag-
netic ﬁeld 2-form in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and plasmas. In §4, 5,
and 6, the energy momentum tensor and the conservation equations for rest
mass (or the number of particles) and for the energy and momentum, are
discussed for perfect ﬂuids and MHD. In Part 2, the theory is applied to
waves. The ﬁelds for the waves are their Lagrangian coordinates, which are
the oscillation centers.

2 Relativistic Thermodynamics of an Ideal

Gas

A proper quantity is one that moves with the ﬂow (i.e.
is measured with
respect to a comoving coordinate system) and so is coordinate independent.
It is a scalar ﬁeld, which is a rank 0 tensor ﬁeld (tensors include scalars and
vectors). I use coordinate independent notation to emphasize the fact that
tensors are independent of the coordinate system. The following thermody-
namic quantities are scalar ﬁelds since they are all proper quantities.

• n′ = proper number density

• m = rest mass of ﬂuid particles

• n = n′m = proper density of rest mass

• ne = internal (thermal) energy density

• e = thermal energy per unit mass

• s = speciﬁc entropy

• ρ = n + ne = total energy density

• T = temperature

• p = nT /m = isotropic pressure

• γ = cp/cv = ∂ ln p/∂ ln n|s = the ratio of speciﬁc heats

• f = (ρ + p)/n = 1 + e + p/n = the index or relativistic speciﬁc enthalpy

4

If n and s are the independent thermodynamic variables, the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics is the conservation of energy:

T ds = de + p d

1
n (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(1)

(2)

If the ﬂow is isentropic, ds = 0 and s is constant. Then the thermodynamic
quantities are functions of n alone, and equation (1) gives

p = n2 de
dn

dp = n df

= f .

3 The Mathematical Formalism

3.1 Three Coordinate Systems

Assume that there is no gravity so that spacetime M is ﬂat. Consider the
following three coordinate systems for M:

1. The observer’s global orthonormal coordinate system x = (x0, x1, x2, x3).

2. A local comoving coordinate system (CMCS) y = (y0, y1, y2, y3) at
each point x ∈ M. This coordinate system is also orthonormal, with
u = ∂/∂y0.

3. A global CMCS z = (z0, z1, z2, z3). z is not orthonormal, so the metric
In this coordinate system, u k ∂/∂z0, and z0 is
g is not diagonal.
closely related to the proper time for a ﬂuid element. The zk are the
ﬁelds which label the worldlines.

3.2 Diﬀerential p-Forms

Let Λp(M)(Λp(M)) be the set of p-forms (p-vectors) on M. A contravariant
vector ﬁeld v ∈ Λ1(M) or a 1-form α ∈ Λ1(M) can be written in terms of
the dual coordinate basis eα = ∂/∂xα and eα = dxα as

v = vµeµ

α = αµeµ

The exterior derivative d : Λp → Λp+1 of α is dα = ∇ ∧ α. A generalized
inner product on forms and p-vectors can be deﬁned as the adjoint of the

5

exterior product:

(

)p : Λq × Λp → Λq−p : (α, β) → (α|β)p ≡ α(β)

|
(α(β)|γ) = α(β, γ) ≡ (α|β ∧ γ) where α ∈ Λq, β ∈ Λp, γ ∈ Λq−p.

q ≥ p, deﬁned by

The Hodge operator ∗ is deﬁned by ∗ : Λp → Λ4−p : β → ∗β

α ∧ ∗β = (α|β)τ ⇔ ∗β = (τ |β)p = τ (β), where α, β ∈ Λp,

(3)

τ = ∗1 =

− det g ǫ,

and ǫ = dx0 ∧ dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3.

p

τ is the volume element 4-form, ǫ is the 4D Levi-Civita tensor, and g is the
metric. If x is a orthonormal coordinate system, detg = −1, and τ = ǫ = d4x.

3.3 The Scalar Fields

3.3.1 Equation of continuity

Compare the problem of a ﬂuid in 2D spacetime (t, x) = (x0, x1) with electro-
magnetism (EM). (The following is also true in 4D spacetime). The equation
of continuity dj = 0 is analogous to Maxwell’s homogeneous equation dF = 0.
j is the dual of the matter current vector J = nu = ∗j, and j = ∗J = ∗ ∗ j.
We have

∇ · J = ∗(dj) = 0 ⇒ dj = 0 ⇒ j = dz

(4)

Thus the equation of continuity implies the existence of the scalar ﬁeld z(t, x)
such that j = dz, just as in EM where we have the vector ﬁeld A and F = dA.
In both cases we use the fact that a closed form is exact. In 4D spacetime,
there are 3 scalar ﬁelds, and

dj = 0 ⇒ j = dz1 ∧ dz2 ∧ dz3

Often a density r is introduced so that zi can be a Cartesian coordinate
system, and then j = r dz1 ∧ dz2 ∧ dz3. The invariant density is

Consider a ﬂuid in ﬂat spacetime M ⊆ R4 (no gravity). We need to
express the Lagrangian in terms of the ﬁelds and their ﬁrst partial derivatives.
For the initial value problem, x0 = t ≥ 0. Deﬁne the initial conﬁguration on
the observer’s 3D hypersurface Σ ⊆ R3 deﬁned by x0 = t = 0. The equations
of motion determine the ﬂow on M for t > 0.

n =

(j|j)

p

6

The three scalar ﬁelds are the Lagrangian coordinates Z ≡ (z1, z2, z3).
They are a coordinate system on Σ and move with the ﬂuid, and are funda-
mental to the theory of all continua. The ﬂow is determined by the projection
Z of a ﬂuid element at x ∈ M onto its initial position Z(x) on Σ:

Z : M → Σ : x → Z(x) = (z1(x), z2(x), z3(x)) where

zk(0, xi) = xk

and dzk(u) = uα ∂zk

∂xα = 0

and the unit 4-velocity u is tangent to the worldlines of the ﬂuid elements
(i.e., the streamlines). The zk have the following properties:

1. They are potentials for the matter current 4-vector J = nu and the

2-form of the electromagnetic ﬁeld F .

2. They are scalar ﬁelds which label ﬂuid elements and so are constant

along worldlines (dzk(u) = 0).

3. They label worldlines, so varying the zk varies the worldlines of the

ﬂuid elements.

4. By using the ﬁelds zk we automatically satisfy the equation of conti-

nuity dj = 0 and conserve matter.

3.4 The Matter Current and Proper Number Density
Let n0 : Σ → R : zk → n0(zk) be the number density on the initial hypersur-
face Σ. The 3-form of a ﬂuid element on the Σ is

j0 = n0 dz1 ∧ dz2 ∧ dz3

and N =

j0

ZΣ

is the total number of particles (or the total rest mass). The ﬂow is described
by the matter current 4-vector J = nu ∈ Λ1(M), or its dual 3-form j = ∗J ∈
Λ3(M). j = Z ∗(j0) is the pull-back of j0 from Σ to M by Z.

Z ∗ : Λ3(Σ) → Λ3(M) : j0 → Z ∗(j0) =

j = r dz1 ∧ dz2 ∧ dz3 =

eαβγ = jαβγeαβγ/3!

r
3!

∂(z1, z2, z3)
∂(xα, xβ, xγ)

where eαβγ = eα ∧ eβ ∧ eγ and r = n0 ◦ Z.

7

The matter current 4-vector is

J = ∗j = ǫ(j) = ǫαβγδjαβγedelta/3! = J δeδ.

(5)

Thus the components of J and j are

J 0 = j123 = r

= γn

J 1 = −j023 = −r

J 2 = j013 = r

= γnv2 J 3 = −j012 = −r

∂(z1, z2, z3)
∂(x1, x2, x3)
∂(z1, z2, z3)
∂(x0, x1, x3)

∂(z1, z2, z3)
∂(x0, x2, x3)
∂(z1, z2, z3)
∂(x0, x1, x2)

= γnv1

= γnv3

These expressions show that the ﬁelds zi are indeed the potentials for the
components of J. They also give the 3-velocity vi = J i/J 0 in terms of the
zi, and the components of the 4-velocity u; u0 = γ = 1/sqrt(1 − v2) and
ui = γvi.

The proper number density n is

n2 = (j|j) = (∗J| ∗ J) = r2(dz1 ∧ dz2 ∧ dz3|dz1 ∧ dz2 ∧ dz3)
= r2det(dzi|dzj)

(6)

r is constant along streamlines since the equation of continuity is

dj = d(∗J) = ∗(∇ · J) = dr ∧ d3z = 0 ⇒ dr(u) = 0 ⇒ r = r(zi)

(7)

The equation of continuity follows from dj0 = 0, since there are no 4-forms
in Σ:

dj = d(Z ∗j0) = Z ∗(dj0) = 0,

since d ◦ Z ∗ = Z ∗◦ d

A current J with ∇ · J = 0 is said to be conserved. Associated with any con-
served current is a conserved ’charge’, which is the total number of particles
(or total rest mass)

3.5 Decomposing Vectors and Tensors

The metric g and 4-velocity u deﬁne a spatial projection operator P = g + uu
such that P (u) = 0, P = P T , P 2 = P, T r(P ) = 3, and P = diag(0, 1, 1, 1) in
a local CMCS. P projects a vector ﬁeld onto the 3D space orthogonal to u at

8

any x ∈ M. A vector ﬁeld A can be written as the sum of a vector parallel
to u and a vector orthogonal to u:

A = −A(u)u + P (A) = au + A′.

a is the temporal part of A and A′ is the spatial part. a and A′ are proper,
coordinate independent quantities. a is a scalar ﬁeld and A′ is a spatial vector
ﬁeld.

If T is a second order tensor ﬁeld, decompose it as follows;

T = T (u, u) − uP (T (u)) − P (T †(u))u + P · T · P

If T is the energy-momentum tensor,

• T (u, u) = proper energy density

• −P (T (u)) = proper energy ﬂux

• −P (T T (u)) = proper momentum density, and

• P T P = proper stress tensor

Only proper quantities appear in the equations of motion, but the observer
measures quantities with respect to his coordinate system. Observed and
proper quantities are related by a Lorentz transformation with the 3-velocity
v(x) of the ﬂuid in the observer’s x coordinate system.

4 Energy-Momentum Tensor and

Conservation Equations

We must write the Lagrangian L in terms of the ﬁelds zk and their ﬁrst
partial derivatives dzk, and calculate the energy-momentum tensor (EMT)

T = Lg − DL where D = dzk ⊗

µeµ ⊗ eν ; Dν

µ = zk
µ

(8)

∂
∂dzk = Dν

∂
∂zk
ν

The ﬁelds are scalars so T = T T and DL are symmetric. DL is spatial since
dzk(u) = 0 so

DL(u) = (DL)†(u) = dzk(u)

∂L
∂dzk = 0

9

The proper energy density is T (u, u) = −L. The proper stress tensor is
P T P = LP −DL. The proper energy ﬂux P (T (u)) = 0 = proper momentum
density. This will not be true when waves are introduced, as things become
more complex.

The Euler-Lagrange equations which follow from varying the ﬁelds zk (i.e.

varying the worldlines of the ﬂuid elements) are

∂L
∂zk − ∇ · Lk = 0 where Lk =

∂L
∂zk
µ

eµ

The Lagrangian has no explicit dependence on x, so the Euler-Lagrange
equation is equivalent to conservation of energy and momentum:

∇ · T = ∇νT ν

µ eµ = 0

(9)

Decomposing equation (9) with respect to u gives

u · (∇ · T ) = 0

and

P (∇ · T ) = 0

(10)

These are the equations for conservation of energy and momentum.

5 Perfect Fluids

The Lagrangian for a perfect ﬂuid is

L = −ρ = −n(1 + e)

Equations (6) and (8) for n and T yield Dn = nP and the well known EMT
for a perfect ﬂuid:

T = Lg − DL = ρuu + pP

The proper energy density is T (u, u) = ρ. The stress tensor is isotropic;
P T P = pP , so T is diagonal in a local CMCS; T = diag(ρ, p, p, p). The
equations of motion are

(11)

(12)

∇ · T = nf a + dp + u∇ · (nf u) = 0

where a = ∇u(u) is the acceleration.

10

5.1 Conservation of Energy

u · (∇ · T ) = dp(u) − ndf (u) = −nT ds(u) = 0

(13)

since ∇ · (nu) = 0. This is the thermodynamic equation (1) for adiabatic
ﬂow (ds(u) = 0). Any two of the following three imply the third:

∇ · (nu) = 0

u · (∇ · T ) = 0

ds(u) = 0

For isentropic ﬂow (ds = 0), equation (13) for the energy is dp = ndf .

5.2 Conservation of Momentum

P (∇ · T ) = nf a + P (dp) = 0

For isentropic ﬂow, dp = ndf , and the equation of motion (14) is

a = −P (df )/f

(14)

(15)

6 Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

6.1 The Electromagnetic Field F

Decomposing the electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld 2-form F with respect to u yields

F = u ∧ E + ∗(u ∧ B)

where E = −F (u) is the proper electric ﬁeld and B = ∗F (u) is the proper
magnetic ﬁeld. Both E and B are spatial vector ﬁelds, since F is anti-
symmetric; E(u) = −F (u, u) = 0 and B(u) = ∗F (u, u) = 0. A MHD
ﬂuid has inﬁnite conductivity which implies a frozen in magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.
E = −F (u) = 0. Thus F = P F P is spatial, and in a global CMCS z,

F = ∗(u ∧ B) = ǫabcbadzb ∧ dzc/2

(16)

where ǫabc is the 3D Levi-Civita tensor and ba are the components of F in
the z coordinate system. So we have F in terms of the ﬁelds zk. Maxwell’s
homogeneous equation

dF = 0 ⇒ dba(u) = 0

So the ba(z1, z2, z3) are constant on streamlines (the ﬁeld is“frozen in”).

11

6.2 The Lagrangian and the Fields
The Lagrangian for the magnetic ﬁeld in MHD is Lb = −(F |F )/2 = −B2/2.
Equation (16) gives F and thus Lb in terms of the ﬁelds zi and their ﬁrst
derivatives dzi:

Lb = −ǫabcǫdef babd(dzb|dze)(dzc|dzf )/4

The total Lagrangian for MHD is the sum of Lb and the Lagrangian for the
matter (11) Lm = −ρ:

L = Lm + Lb = −ρ − B2/2

(17)

(18)

6.3 The Energy Momentum Tensor (EMT)
From (16) and (8) we ﬁnd that DLb = BB − B2P , so the EMT for the
magnetic ﬁeld is

Tb = Lbg − DLb = B2(uu + P ) − BB

Using (12) for Tm gives the total EMT:

T = Tm + Tb = (ρ + B2/2)uu + (p + B2/2)P − BB

(19)

If e1 k B in a CMCS, T is diagonal:

T 00 = ρ + B2/2

T 11 = p − B2/2

T 22 = T 33 = p + B2/2

6.4 The MHD equations

The equations for MHD are ∇ · (nu) = 0 and

∇ · T = ∇ · [(nf + B2)u]u + (nf + B2)a + ∇p + (∇B)†(B)
−(∇ · B)B − ∇B(B) = 0
dF = 0 ⇔ ∇ · ∗F = ∇ · (Bu − uB) = (∇ · B)u + ∇u(B)
−(∇ · u)B − ∇B(u) = 0

(20)

(21)

6.4.1 Conservation of Energy

The energy equation for MHD is the projection of equation (20) onto u;
u · (∇ · T ) = 0. It is the same as the energy equation (13) for a perfect ﬂuid.

12

6.4.2 Conservation of Momentum

The MHD equation of motion is the spatial part of (20):

P (∇ · T ) = (nf + B2)a + nP (df ) − (∇ · B)B − P (dB(B)) = 0

(22)

Maxwell’s inhomogeneous equation relates the electric current 4-vector K to
B = ∗F (u):

K = ∗d ∗ F = ∗d(B ∧ u) = ∗dB(u) − ∗du(B).

The MHD equation of motion can be written as

P (∇ · T ) = (nf + B2)a + nP (df ) − K × B = 0

where is Lorentz force is K × B = P (K) × B = ∗(u ∧ K ∧ B).

Part II
Waves in Continua

7 Formulating the Problem

The following theory of waves in continua gives the dispersion relation and
polarization of the various modes, the bi-characteristic rays, the equation
governing the wave amplitude, the ray equations which determine the wave
vector along the rays, and the EMT of the waves, the average background
ﬂow, and interaction between the waves and the average background ﬂow.
There are three 4-vector ﬁelds associated with any wave mode. They are

1. The wave 4-vector k = ωu + κ, where ω = −k(u) and κ = P (k) are the

proper frequency and wavenumber vector.

2. The phase 4-velocity vφ = u+vp is the 4-velocity of a surface of constant
phase. P (vφ) = vp = ωκ/κ2 is the (proper) spatial phase velocity with
respect to the ﬂuid, i.e. as seen in a CMCS.

3. The group 4-velocity g = u + vg is the 4-velocity of wavefronts (or of
wave quanta or wave packets). P (g) = vg = ∂ω/∂κ is the spatial group
velocity in a CMCS.

13

Waves in continua are described by the characteristic hypersurfaces (with
normal k) and bi-characteristic rays (integral curves of w). k satisﬁes the
dispersion relation. Wavefronts can be thought of as discontinuities in the
solutions to the equations of motion. Consider plane waves with surfaces of
constant phase given by ϕ(x) = (k|x) = kµxµ, so k = dϕ is the normal to
the hypersurfaces ϕ(x) = constant.

7.1 The Two Sets of Independent Coordinates and Fields

Make the usual assumption that the average background ﬂow varies little
over a period or a wavelength of the waves (the WKB approximation). The
following theory of the waves and their interaction with the background ﬂow
requires two sets of independent coordinates and ﬁelds, i.e. two maps from
Euclidean to Lagrangian coordinates, together with a Lorentz transformation
from the local CMCS y to the x coordinate system (CS) of the observer. The
Lagrangian is a scalar ﬁeld so it can be calculated using the coordinates that
are most convenient. The two sets of coordinates and ﬁelds must be clearly
deﬁned. They are:

1. zi : x → zi(x) ; (x, z) refers to the average ﬂow ;

2. wi : y → wi(y) = yi + φi(y) where φi(y) = αi cos ϕ(y) ;

(x, z) deﬁnes the slowly varying ﬂow of the average position of the ﬂuid
elements (i.e. the ﬂow of the oscillation centers), called the average or back-
ground ﬂow. x is the position of an oscillation center, rather than a ﬂuid
element. zi(x) is the initial position of the oscillation center of the ﬂuid
element whose oscillation center is at x.

(y, w) deﬁnes the waves in a local CMCS y in the neighborhood of any
x ∈ M. The y CS is moving with the 4-velocity u of the ﬂuid’s oscillation
centers, so that e0 = ∂/∂y0 = u in this CS. The ﬁelds wi(y) are the oscillation
centers, the average position of the ﬂuid element at y. φi(y) = αi cos ϕ(y)
is the displacement due to waves. The spatial vector α = (α1, α2, α3) is the
wave amplitude. For a plane wave, the phase ϕ(y) = (k|y) is rapidly varying,
but α and k = dϕ are slowly varying functions of x (not y). To treat the
waves, we replace the ﬁelds wi by αi and ϕ, the appropriate ﬁelds for waves.
Varying α gives the dispersion relation and polarization ˆα = α/|α|. Varying
ϕ gives the group velocity, the rays, and the equation for conservation of wave
action (or wave quanta–dividing by Planck’s constant gives a dimensionless

14

number that is conserved, which I call quanta, even though this is not a
quantum theory). This determines how the wave amplitude evolves as the
wave propagates through the ﬂuid.

8 The Average Lagrangian

In the following, I will denote rapidly varying quantities with a prime, and
averaged ones as unprimed.

The (slowly varying) average Lagrangian L(zk, dzk, α, k; x) of the total
wave-background system is derived as follows. Make a Taylor expansion
about the background ﬂow (of the oscillation centers) of the rapidly varying
Lagrangian L′ of the actual ﬂow, to order α2. Then average L′ over the phase
ϕ (Whitham 1974) to get the total average Lagrangian L = L0 + Lw, where
L0 is the Lagrangian of the background and Lw is the wave Lagrangian.
One can argue that the rapidly varying part of L would average out in the
integration in Hamilton’s principle anyway.

8.1 Sound Waves in a Perfect Fluid

Apply the coordinates (y, w) to (6). We have

n′(y) = r(w)

det(dwi|dwj) = n + δn

dwi = dyi + dφi = ei − αik sin ϕ

p

To order α2 we have

δn/n = −κ · α sin ϕ − ω2α2 sin2 ϕ/2

Expand L′ = −ρ′ = −n′[1 + e(n′)]about n′ to order α2:

The total average Lagrangian is

L = hL′i = L0 + Lw = −n(1 + e) + nf [ω2α2 − c2(κ · α)2]/4

(25)

For ideal gases, relativistic kinetic theory gives exact expressions for n, e, ρ, p, γ,
and c as functions of T/m (Lightmann et.al. 1975). For a monatomic ideal
gas, as T → 0, γ → 5/3 and c2 → 5T /3m, and as T → ∞, ρ → 3p, so
c2 = dp/dρ → 1/3 and γ → 4/3.

8.2 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Waves

Repeating this procedure for MHD, expand L′ = L′
to order α2 and average over ϕ to get

m + L′

b = −ρ′ − (F ′|F ′)/2

L = hL′i = L0m + L0b + Lwm + Lwb

(26)

The subscript 0 refers to the background ﬂow, w refers to the waves, m to
the matter, and b to the magnetic ﬁeld.

Equation (25) gives hL′

mi = Lm = L0m + Lwm. The calculation for Lb
is analogous to that for (23). Using equation (16) for F ′ = ∗(u ∧ B′) and
substituting (y, w) for (x, z) in L′

b gives

b = −ǫabcǫdef BaBd(dwb|dwe)(dwc|dwf )/4
L′

(27)

Putting dwi = ei − αik sin ϕ in (27) and averaging yields
bi = −B2/2 + Lbw, where

Lb = hL′

4Lbw = k2[(α · B)2 − α2B2] + (B ∧ α ∧ κ|B ∧ α ∧ κ)

(28)

is the part of Lw due to the magnetic ﬁeld. After averaging, set hwii = yi →
xi since xi is the position of the oscillation center of the ﬂuid element. Thus
the total average Lagrangian (26) is

L = L0 + Lw ; L0 = −ρ − B2/2 and Lw = Lwm + Lwb
4Lw = ω2α2[nf + B2 − ( ˆα · B)2] − (nf c2 + B2)(κ · α)2
−α2(κ · B)2 + 2(κ · α)(κ · B)(α · B)

(29)

8.2.1 Alfven Waves: B · α = κ · α = 0

For Alfven waves (29) gives

2Lw = (nf + B2)ω2α2 − (κ · B)2α2

(30)

8.2.2 Magnetosonic Waves: B ∧ α ∧ κ = 0

For the fast and slow magnetosonic modes (29) gives
4Lw = [nf + B2 − ( ˆα · B)2]ω2α2 − nf c2(κ · α)2 − κ2α2[B2 − ( ˆα · B)2] (31)

9 The Dispersion Relation, Phase Velocity,

and Polarization

To discuss the dispersion and polarization relations write Lw as a symmetric
quadratic function of the wave amplitude α on the 3D space orthogonal to u
(at each x ∈ M):

Lw = C(α, α)/2
where C is a 3 x 3 matrix. The ﬁelds for the waves are α and ϕ, the action-
angle coordinates. The Euler-Lagrange equation for α is

∂Lw
∂α

= C(α) = 0 ⇒ det C = 0

which is the dispersion relation. det C = 0 is a cubic for v2
there are 3 solutions for v2
the polarization ˆα = α/|α|. The phase 4-velocity is vφ = u ± vp.

p = ω2/κ2, so
p and 3 corresponding solutions of C( ˆα) = 0 for

9.1 Sound Waves

Writing equation (25) in the form Lw = C(α, α)/2 yields

C = nf (ω2P − c2κκ)

If e1 k κ, C is
P is the identity matrix of the 3D space orthogonal to u.
diagonal, the dispersion relation is det C = ω4(ω2 − c2κ2) = 0. vp = 0
when κ · α = 0, corresponding to transverse modes which are comoving
discontinuities and do not propagate. The longitudinal mode with κ k α is a
sound wave with

ω2 = c2κ2 ⇒ vp = vg = cˆκ

fall into two classes, depending on the polarization ˆα. When α1 = α2 = 0,
ˆα = e3 is ⊥ to the plane containing B and κ. These are Alfven waves with
dispersion relation C33 = 0.When α3 = 0 and α lies in the plane of B and κ,
we have magnetosonic waves with dispersion relation

C11C22 − (C12)2 = 0

9.2.1 Alfven Waves

Alfven waves are transverse, with α ⊥ both κ and B, and equation (30) for

modes is det C = 0, which is a quadratic equation for the square of the phase

The polarization of sound waves (α k κ) and Alfven waves (α ⊥ κ) is clear.

paper (reference here).

10 Wave Quanta, Group Velocity, and Rays

Wave action can be replaced by the equivalent, more intuitive concept of
wave quanta (let Planck’s constant ~ = 1). Even though everything is con-
tinuous, we will refer to the wave action as wave quanta. The discussion of
wave quanta, group velocity, and the rays, is clariﬁed by writing the wave
Lagrangian as a symmetric function of k:

Lw = Q(k, k)/2

(36)

where Q = Q† is symmetric. The Euler-Lagrange equation for ϕ expresses
conservation of wave quanta. Since ϕ has been averaged over, we have

10.3 The Normal Cone, The Ray Cone, and the Ray

Equations

The bi-characteristic rays are the world lines of wave quanta and integral
curves of the group 4-velocity g = u±vg or the wave quanta current A = Ng.
There are two directions for the rays of each mode, corresponding to g = u+vg
and g = u − vg. The 3D characteristic hypersurfaces {C : ϕ(x) = constant}
are wavefronts, across which discontinuities occur. Since k = dϕ and k ·g = 0,
rays lie in characteristic surfaces. The wavefront for a disturbance at the
origin x = 0 divides spacetime M into two regions: behind or ahead of the
wavefront. The wavefront can be thought of as the envelope of the surfaces
orthogonal to the rays formed by a burst of wave quanta from the origin.

Q deﬁnes two quadratic cones at each point of spacetime: the normal
cone Q(k, k) = 0, which is generated by the rays which are integral curves
of A, and the ray cone Q−1(A, A) = 0, dual to the normal cone, which is
generated by the wave-vector k. Each of the two cones is the envelope of
the planes orthogonal to the rays of the other. It is useful to look at the
spatial cross sections of these cones obtained by setting the time components
equal to 1. In MHD, the surfaces have axial symmetry about the magnetic
ﬁeld. The cross section of the normal cone Q(k, k) = 0 is called the normal

21

or wave-vector surface. The cross section of the ray cone Q−1(A, A) = 0
is called the ray surface. Its useful to plot vg(θ) and vp(θ). For a further
discussion of the non-relativistic results see Courant and Hilbert Vol. II, §VI
(1962).

Since k = dϕ, dk = d2ϕ = 0. If k′

11 The Energy Momentum Tensor (EMT)

The total canonical EMT for a system consisting of a slowing varying back-
ground ﬂow interacting with waves is

T = Lg − DL − k

where L = L0(zi, dzi; x) + Lw(zi, dzi, α, k; x)

∂L
∂k

The EMT T divides naturally into 3 parts:

T = T0 + I + W = background + interaction + waves, where

(44)

T0 = L0g − DL0

;

I = −DLw

; W = −k

= kA

∂Lw
∂k

T0 is the EMT of the background alone, since D = dzk ⊗ ∂/∂dzk and L0
depend only on the background ﬁelds. Since I is the derivative of Lw with
respect to the background ﬁelds, it is the EMT of the wave-background
interaction. W involves only the wave ﬁeld k and Lw, so it is the EMT of
the waves alone.

We need to know the action of D on all the quantities in L:

Dn = nP
Du = −P u
Dκ = ωP u − uκu

D(κ · α) = ωαu

DB = BP − P B − uBu
D(B · κ) = (B · κ)P − κB + ωBu

Df = f c2P

Dc2 = 2γ′c2P

(45)

DJ = Jg − gJ
Dω = κu
Dk = D(ωu + κ) = 0
DT = (γ − 1)T P
DB2 = 2(B2P − BB)
D(B · α) = (B · α)P − αB

Dγ = −ζγP

ζ =

T
cpc2
v

dT

and γ′ = (γ − 1 − c2 − ζ)/2.

11.1 The Proper Components of the EMT

The decomposition of the parts of the EMT with respect to u yields the
proper energy and momentum density and ﬂux. The wave EMT W is

W = k ⊗ A = N(ωu + κ) ⊗ (u + vg) = Euu + Euvg + Nκu + Nκvg

(46)

23

The total EMT due to the waves is Tw = I + W = the wave + interaction
EMT. Since L depends only on scalar ﬁelds, T , T0, and Tw are symmetric,
but I and W are not. We have T = T0 + Tw, where T0 is the EMT of the
background given in Part 1, and

Tw = I + W = E(uu + uvg + vgu) + Nκvg + P IP

(47)

11.1.1 The Components of the EMT for Waves

The energy and momentum density and ﬂux for the waves are the components
of W and Tw. They can be read oﬀ from equations (46) and (47). The wave
energy density is

W (u, u) = Tw(u, u) = E = Nω

since the interaction energy density I(u, u) = 0. The interaction energy ﬂux
density is P (I(u)) = 0 also. The wave momentum density is −P (W †(u)) =
Nκ, as one would expect. However, this term in W is canceled by one in I
to give the total wave + interaction momentum density

−P (T †

w(u)) = −P (I †(u) + W †(u)) = Evg = −P (Tw(u))

as one would expect. The wave pressure tensor is

P TwP = P IP + P W P = P IP + Nκvg

which is always symmetric.

11.2 Sound Waves

The EMT of the background is T0 = ρuu + pP . For the waves, vp = vg = cˆκ,
and

Tw = I + W = E(uu + cuˆκ + cˆκu + ˆκˆκ + γ′P )

The components of Tw in a CMCS are

Tw(u, u) = E = Nω

P TwP = E(γ′P + ˆκˆκ)

−P (Tw(u)) = −P (T †

w(u)) = Ecˆκ

The components of the total EMT are

T = T0 + Tw = (ρ + E)uu + Ec(uˆκ + ˆκu) + Eˆκˆκ + (p + γ′)P

(48)

24

11.3 MHD Waves

The EMT of the background for MHD was given in equation (19).

11.3.1 Alfven Waves
The phase and group velocities are vp = vA cos θˆκ and vg = vA ˆB (see eq.
(33) and §10.2.1. Using (45) to calculate the EMT yields

Tw = E(uu + vAu ˆB + vA ˆBu) + ω2α2[nf (1 − c2)P + 2BB]/4
T = T0 + Tw

11.3.2 Magnetosonic Waves

The phase velocity, group velocity and energy density of the fast and slow
magnetosonic modes are given in §9.2.2 and §10.2.2. The EMT for the waves
is

Tw = E(uu + uvg + vgu) + P TwP

The expression for the wave pressure tensor P TwP is quite complex and I
will not reproduce it here.

11.4 The Equations for The Total Wave-Background

System

The following equations completely determine the waves and the background
ﬂow:

∇ · T = 0

∇ · J = 0

∇ · A = 0

and the ray equations (41) and (43). One must include the EMT of the
waves Tw when it is comparable to T0, i.e., when the wave energy density E
is comparable to the thermal or magnetic ﬁeld energy density p or B2, e.g.
in the solar wind. Waves transport energy and momentum in ways in which
other processes cannot. A similar treatment can be given for plasma waves
(Jacques 1988) and wave in other continua.

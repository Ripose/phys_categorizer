Lorentz and “apparent” transformations of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds

It is recently discovered that the usual transformations of the three-dimensional
(3D) vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds diﬀer from the Lorentz trans-
formations (LT) (boosts) of the corresponding 4D quantities that represent the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In this paper, using geometric algebra formalism,
this fundamental diﬀerence is examined representing the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds by bivectors.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently1,2,3 it is proved that, contrary to the general belief, the usual trans-
formations of the three-dimensional (3D) vectors of the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, see, e.g., Ref. 4, Eqs.
(11.148) and (11.149), diﬀer from the Lorentz
transformations (LT) (boosts) of the corresponding 4D quantities that repre-
sent the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. (The usual transformations will be called
the “apparent” transformations (AT) and the name will be explained in Sec.
IV.) Comparisons with experiments, the motional emf,2 the Faraday disk3 and
the Trouton-Noble experiment,5,6 show that this new approach1−3,5.6 with 4D
geometric quantities always agrees with the principle of relativity and with ex-
periments, while it it is not the case with the usual approach in which the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds are represented by the 3D vectors E and B that transform
according to the AT. The mentioned agreement with experiments is indepen-
dent of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it.
The main point in the geometric approach1−3,5.6 is that the physical meaning,
both theoretically and experimentally, is attributed to 4D geometric quantities,
and not, as usual, to 3D quantities.

In this paper I shall present a simpliﬁed version of the proof of the diﬀerence
between the LT and the AT that is already given in Secs. 3.3 and 4 in Ref. 2.
For all mathematical details for the used geometric algebra formalism readers
can consult Refs. 7, 8.

As shown in Refs. 2, 3 the electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be represented
by diﬀerent algebraic objects; 1-vectors, bivectors or their combination. The
representation with 1-vectors E and B is simpler than others and also closer
to the usual expressions with the 3D vectors E and B, but here we shall only
deal with bivectors. The reason is that the representation with bivectors, as in
our Eq. (2), is always employed in Refs. 7, 8 and we want to make comparison
with their results. In Sec. II. A a new Lorentz invariant representation, Ev and
Bv, is presented that is introduced in Refs. 2 and 3. In Sec. II. B we simply

1

derive from Ev and Bv the observer dependent expressions for the electric EH
and magnetic BH ﬁelds, which are always exploited in Refs. 7, 8. E′
H (and
B′
H ), which are the LT (the active ones) of EH (and BH ), Eqs. (9) and (10),
are derived in Sec.
III using the fact that every multivector must transform
under the active LT in the same way, i.e., according to Eq. (8). Furthermore,
it is known that any multivector, when written in terms of components and a
basis, must remain unchanged under the passive LT, like some general bivector
in Eq. (13). Hence observers in relatively moving inertial frames S and S′ “see”
the same EH , i.e., Eq. (14) holds for EH . These fundamental achievements
for the LT of bivectors EH (and BH) are ﬁrst obtained in Ref. 2. Hestenes7
and the Cambridge group8 derived the transformations for EH and BH (Ref.
7, Space-Time Algebra, Eq. (18.22), New Foundations for Classical Mechanics,
Ch. 9, Eqs. (3.51a,b) and Ref. 8, Sec. 7.1.2, Eq. (7.33)) in the way that is
presented in Sec. IV, Eqs. (15) and (16) for E′
H,at, and Eqs. (17), (18) and
(19) for components. The transformations for components, Eqs. (18) and (19),
are identical to the usual transformations for components of the 3D E and B,
Ref. 4, Eq. (11.148). Such usual transformations are quoted in every textbook
and paper on relativistic electrodynamics already from the time of Einstein’s
fundamental paper.9 They are always considered (including Refs. 7, 8) to be
the LT of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. However it is obvious from (15)
and (16) that E′
H,at is not obtained by the active LT from EH , since (15) is
drastically diﬀerent than the correct LT (8) and (9). Furthermore, as seen from
Eq. (20), Eq. (13) is not fulﬁlled, which means that EH and E′
H,at are not
the same physical quantity for relatively moving observers in S and S′. Again,
completely diﬀerent result than that one obtained by the correct passive LT,
Eq. (14). This shows that neither the usual transformations of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds from Refs. 7, 8 nor the usual transformations for components,
Ref. 4, Eqs. (11.148), are the LT. The conclusions are given in Sec. V together
with the short presentation of the fundamental diﬀerence between the LT and
the AT when dealing with 1-vectors E and B.

II. ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS AS BIVECTORS

In this geometric approach physical quantities will be represented by 4D ge-
ometric quantities, multivectors, that are deﬁned without reference frames, or,
when some basis has been introduced, these quantities are represented as 4D ge-
ometric quantities comprising both components and a basis. For simplicity and
for easier understanding, only the standard basis {γµ; 0, 1, 2, 3} of orthonormal
1-vectors, with timelike vector γ0 in the forward light cone, will be used in the
Minkowski spacetime M 4, but remembering that the approach with 4D geomet-
ric quantities holds for any choice of basis in M 4. The basis vectors γµ generate
by multiplication a complete basis for the spacetime algebra: 1, γµ, γµ ∧ γν,
γµγ5, γ5 (16 independent elements). γ5 is the right-handed unit pseudoscalar,
γ5 = γ0 ∧ γ1 ∧ γ2 ∧ γ3. Any multivector can be expressed as a linear combination
of these 16 basis elements of the spacetime algebra. It is worth noting that the
standard basis {γµ} corresponds, in fact, to the speciﬁc system of coordinates,

2

i.e., to Einstein’s system of coordinates. In the Einstein system of coordinates
the Einstein synchronization9 of distant clocks and Cartesian space coordinates
xi are used in the chosen inertial frame of reference. However diﬀerent systems
of coordinates of an inertial frame of reference are allowed and they are all
equivalent in the description of physical phenomena.

A. Lorentz invariant electric and magnetic ﬁelds

The electromagnetic ﬁeld is represented by a bivector-valued function F =
F (x) on the spacetime. As shown in Refs. 2, 3 the observer independent F
can be decomposed into two bivectors Ev and Bv representing the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds and the unit time-like 1-vector v/c as

F = Ev + cIBv, Ev = (1/c2)(F · v) ∧ v = (1/2c2)(F − vF v),

IBv = (1/c3)(F ∧ v) · v = (1/2c3)(F + vF v),

(1)

where I is the unit pseudoscalar and v is the velocity (1-vector) of a family of
observers who measures Ev and Bv ﬁelds. Observe that Ev and Bv depend
not only on F but on v as well. All quantities F , Ev, Bv, I and v are deﬁned
without reference frames. (I is deﬁned algebraically without introducing any
reference frame, as in Ref. 10 Sec. 1.2.) Such 4D geometric quantities will be
called the absolute quantities (AQs), while their representations in some basis
will be called coordinate-based geometric quantities (CBGQs). For example,
in the {γµ} basis the AQ Ev from (1) is represented by the following CBGQ
Ev = (1/c2)F µν vνvβγµ ∧ γβ

B. Electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the γ0 - frame

For comparison with the usual treatments7,8 let us choose the frame in which
the observers who measure Ev and Bv are at rest. For them v = cγ0. This frame
will be called the frame of “ﬁducial” observers or the γ0 - frame. In that frame
Ev and Bv from (1) become the observer dependent (γ0 - dependent) EH and
BH and instead of Eq. (1) we have

F = EH + cγ5BH , EH = (F · γ0)γ0 = (1/2)(F − γ0F γ0),

γ5BH = (1/c)(F ∧ γ0)γ0 = (1/2c)(F + γ0F γ0).

(2)

(The subscript H is for “Hestenes.”) Ev and Bv in the γ0 - frame are denoted
as EH and BH since they are identical to 4D quantities used by Hestenes7 and
the Cambridge group8 for the representation of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
We note that such procedure is never used by Hestenes7 and the Cambridge
group8 since they deal from the outset only with γ0 and thus with a space-time
split in the γ0 - frame, i.e., with the relations (2). This shows that the space-
time split and the corresponding observer dependent form for the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds, (2), which is always used in Refs. 7, 8, is simply obtained in

3

our approach going to the frame of the ”ﬁducial” observers, i.e., replacing some
general velocity v in (1) by cγ0.

EH and BH from (2) can be written as CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ}.

They are

EH = F i0

γi ∧ γ0, BH = (1/2c)εkli0
It follows from (3) that the components of EH, BH in the {γµ} basis (i.e., in the
Einstein system of coordinates) give rise to the tensor (components) (EH )µν =
γν · (γµ · EH ) = (γν ∧ γµ) · EH , (and the same for (BH )µν ) which, written out
as a matrix, have entries

Fklγi ∧ γ0.

(3)

= F i0

(EH )i0
(BH )i0 = (1/2c)εkli0Fkl = Bi,

= Ei,

(EH )ij = 0,

(BH )ij = 0.

(EH )µν is antisymmetric, i.e., (EH )νµ = −(EH)µν , and the same holds for
(BH )µν . (EH )µν from Eq. (4) can be written in a matrix form as

(EH )µν =

E1 = F 10
E2 = F 20
E3 = F 30




(4)

(5)

and readers can check that the same matrix form is obtained for (BH )µν .
((BH )10 = (1/c)F 32 = B1.)

Thus we see from (3), and (4) or (5), that
(i) both bivectors EH and BH are parallel to γ0, EH ∧ γ0 = BH ∧ γ0 = 0,
and consequently all space-space components of (EH )µν and (BH )µν are zero,
(EH )ij = (BH )ij = 0.

In the usual covariant approaches4 the components of the 3D E and B are

identiﬁed with six independent components of F µν according to the relations

Ei = F i0, Bi = (−1/2c)εiklFkl.
In (6) and hereafter the components of the 3D ﬁelds E and B are written with
lowered (generic) subscripts, since they are not the spatial components of the
4D quantities. This refers to the third-rank antisymmetric ε tensor too. The
super- and subscripts are used only on the components of the 4D quantities.

(6)

Comparing (4) and (6) we see that they similarly identify the components
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds with six independent components of F µν .
However there are important diﬀerences between the relations (3), (4) or (5),
and (6). In the usual covariant approaches, e.g., Ref. 4, the 3D E and B, as
geometric quantities in the 3D space, are constructed from these six independent
components of F µν and the unit 3D vectors i, j, k, e.g., E =F 10i + F 20j +
F 30k. Observe that the mapping, i.e., the simple identiﬁcation, Eq. (6), of
the components Ei and Bi with some components of F µν (deﬁned on the 4D
spacetime) is not a permissible tensor operation, i.e., it is not a mathematically
correct procedure. The same holds for the construction of the 3D vectors E and

4

B in which the components of the 4D quantity F µν are multiplied with the unit
3D vectors, see Ref. 3 for the more detailed discussion. On the other hand, as
seen from Eqs. (3), (4) or (5), EH and BH and their components (EH )µν and
(BH )µν are obtained by a correct mathematical procedure from the geometric
4D quantities F and γµ. The components (EH )µν and (BH )µν are multiplied by
the unit bivectors γi ∧γ0 (4D quantities) to form the geometric 4D quantities EH
and BH. In such a treatment the unit 3D vectors i, j, k, (geometric quantities
in the 3D space) do not appear at any point.

Furthermore it is worth noting that F µν are only components (numbers) that
are (implicitly) determined in Einstein’s system of coordinates. Components
are frame-dependent numbers (frame-dependent because the basis refers to a
speciﬁc frame). Components tell only part of the story, while the basis contains
the rest of the information about the considered physical quantity. These facts
are completely overlooked in all usual covariant approaches and in the above
identiﬁcations (6) of Ei and Bi with some components of F µν .

III. LT OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS AS BIVECTORS

Let us now apply the active LT (only boosts are considered) to EH and BH
from Eq. (3). In the usual geometric algebra formalism7,8 the LT are considered
as active transformations; the components of, e.g., some 1-vector relative to a
given inertial frame of reference (with the standard basis {γµ}) are transformed
into the components of a new 1-vector relative to the same frame (the basis {γµ}
R = 1, in
is not changed). Furthermore the LT are described with rotors R, R
the usual way as p → p′ = Rp
e
R is
e
deﬁned by the operation of reversion according to which
a = a, for
any vector a, and it reverses the order of vectors in any given expression. Every
rotor in spacetime can be written in terms of a bivector as R = eθ/2. For boosts
in arbitrary direction the rotor R is

µγµ. Remember that the reverse

R = p′

AB =

R = eθ/2 = (1 + γ + γβγ0n)/(2(1 + γ))1/2,

(7)

θ = αγ0n, β is the scalar velocity in units of c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2, or in terms of
an ‘angle’ α we have tanh α = β, cosh α = γ, sinh α = βγ, and n is not the basis
vector but any unit space-like vector orthogonal to γ0; eθ = cosh α + γ0n sinh α.
One can also express the relationship between two relatively moving frames S
and S′ in terms of rotor as γ′
R. For boosts in the direction γ1 the rotor
R is given by the relation (7) with γ1 replacing n (all in the standard basis
e
{γµ}). For simplicity we shall only consider boosts in the direction γ1.

As said in Sec. IV in Hestenes’ paper7 in AJP Lorentz rotations preserve
the geometric product. This implies that any multivector M transforms by the
active LT in the same way as mentioned above for the 1-vector p, i.e.,

µ = Rγµ

M → M

see, e.g., Eq. (69) in Hestenes’ paper7 in AJP. It is not important is M a simple
blade or a Cliﬀord aggregate, is it a function of some other multivectors or it is
not.

Hence, according to (8), under the active LT EH from (2) must transform

in the following way

and (9).

Instead of using the active LT we can deal with the passive LT. The es-
sential diﬀerence relative to the usual covariant picture is the presence of the

basis in a CBGQ. The existence of the basis causes that every 4D CBGQ is
invariant under the passive LT; the components transform by the LT and the
basis by the inverse LT leaving the whole 4D CBGQ unchanged. This means
that such CBGQ represents the same physical quantity for relatively moving 4D
observers. For some general bivector N the components transform according
to (12), whereas the basis γ′

In addition, let us see how one can ﬁnd the expression for Ev from (1) as a

CBGQ in the S′ frame and in the
µ(cid:9)
observers (that are in the S frame) are moving with velocity v whose components
are v′µ = (γc, −γβc, 0, 0). Of course, for the whole CBGQ v it holds that
v = v′µγ′
µ = vµγµ, where the components vµ from S are vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0). Then

IV. APPARENT TRANSFORMATIONS OF ELECTRIC AND

MAGNETIC FIELDS AS BIVECTORS

In contrast to the LT of EH (and BH ), Eqs. (9) and (10), it is accepted in
the usual geometric algebra formalism that EH (and BH ) do not transform as
all other multivectors transform, but that they transform as

(15)

where F ′ = RF
R. (The subscript “at” is for AT.) It is seen from (15) that
only F is transformed while γ0 is not transformed. The transformation (15)
e
is nothing else than the usual transformation of the electric ﬁeld that is given
(18.22), New Foundations for Classical
in Ref. 7, Space-Time Algebra, Eq.
Mechanics, Ch. 9, Eqs. (3.51a,b) and Ref. 8, Sec. 7.1.2, Eq. (7.33).

4, Eq. (11.148), which are quoted in every textbook and paper on relativistic
electrodynamics from the time of Lorentz, Poincar´e and Einstein.

We see from (15), (16), (17), (18) and (19) that

In all geometric algebra formalisms, e.g., Refs. 7, 8, the AT (16) for E′

H,at
(and similarly for B′
H,at) are considered to be the LT of EH (BH ). However,
contrary to the generally accepted opinion, the transformations (15), (16), (17),
(18) and (19) are not the LT. The LT cannot transform the matrix (5) with
(EH )ij = 0 to the matrix (17) with (E′
H,at)ij = 0. Furthermore Eq. (13) is not

which means that these two quantities are not connected by the LT, and con-
sequently they do not refer to the same 4D quantity for relatively moving ob-
servers. As far as relativity is concerned these quantities are not related to one
another. The fact that they are measured by two observers (γ0 - and γ′
0 - ob-
servers) does not mean that relativity has something to do with the problem.
The reason is that observers in the γ0 - frame and in the γ′
0 - frame are not
looking at the same physical quantity but at two diﬀerent quantities. Every
observer makes measurement on its own quantity and such measurements are
not related by the LT. The LT of EH are correctly given by Eqs. (9), (10) and
(11). Therefore we call the transformations (15) and (16) for geometric quan-
tities, and (18) and (19) for components, the “apparent” transformations, the
AT. The same name is introduced by Rohrlich11 for the Lorentz contraction;

8

the Lorentz contracted length and the rest length are not connected by the LT
and consequently they do not refer to the same 4D quantity.

E′ and B′ as geometric quantities in the 3D space, are constructed multiplying
the components E′
i by the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′. The important
objections to such usual construction of E′ and B′ are the following: First, the
components E′
i are determined by the AT (18) and (19) and not by the
LT. Second, there is no transformation which transforms the unit 3D vectors
i, j, k into the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′. Hence it is not true that, e.g., the
3D vector E′=E′
3k′ is obtained by the LT from the 3D vector
E =E1i + E2j + E3k . Cosequently the 3D vector E′ and E are not the same
quantity for relatively moving inertial observers, E′6= E. Thus, although it is
possible to identify the components of the 3D E and B with the components of
F (according to Eq. (6)) in an arbitrary chosen γ0 - frame with the {γµ} basis
such an identiﬁcation is meaningless for the Lorentz transformed F ′.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The main conclusion that can be drawn from this paper, and Refs. 1-3, is
that the usual transformations of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are not the
LT. It is believed by the whole physics community that the LT of the matrix
of components (EH )µν , Eq. (5), for which the space-space components (EH )ij
are zero and (EH )i0 = Ei, transform that matrix to the matrix (E′
H,at)µν , Eq.
(17), in which again the space-space components (E′
H,at)ij are zero and the
time-space components (E′
at. are given by the usual transformations
for the components of the 3D vector E, Eq. (18); the transformed components
E′i
at. are expressed by the mixture of Ei and Bi components. (This statement
is equivalent to saying that the transformations (18) and (19) are the LT of the
components of the 3D E and B.) However, according to the correct mathemat-
ical procedure, the LT of the matrix of components (EH )µν , Eq. (5), transform
that matrix to the matrix (E′
H )ij 6= 0. As seen from
(11) all transformed components (E′
H )µν of the electric ﬁeld are determined
only by three components Ei of the electric ﬁeld; there is no mixture with three
components Bi of the magnetic ﬁeld.

H,at)i0 = E′i

It is worth noting that the whole consideration is much clearer when using
1-vectors E and B, as in Refs. 2, 3, for the representation of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. Then, e.g., E = (1/c)F · v. In the frame of ”ﬁducial” observers
it becomes E = F · γ0, E = Eiγi = F i0γi. By the active LT the electric ﬁeld E
transforms again to the electric ﬁeld (according to (8)) E′ = R(F ·γ0)
R = F ′ ·γ′
0,
i.e., E′ = E′µγµ = −βγE1γ0 + γE1γ1 + E2γ2 + E3γ, which now contains
e
the temporal component E′0 = −βγE1. This is the way in which a 1-vector
transforms. (Generally, for components, E′0 = γ(E0−βE1), E′1 = γ(E1−βE0),
E′2,3 = E2,3.) For the passive LT it holds that E = Eµγµ = E′µγ′
µ; E is the

same quantity for relatively moving observers. On the other hand the AT (18)
for components are obtained taking that E′
at = F ′ · γ0, only F is transformed
but not γ0, i.e., E′

at = E1γ1 + γ(E2 − βcB3)γ2 + γ(E3 + βcB2)γ3, and obviously E and E′
E′
at
are not the same quantity for relatively moving observers, Eiγi 6= E′i
atγi. All
the same as for bivectors EH and BH but much simpler and closer to the usual
formulation with the 3D E and B. However there is already extensive literature,
e.g., Refs. 7, 8, in which the bivectors EH and BH are employed. Therefore, in
this paper, the elaboration of the fundamental diﬀerence between the AT and
the LT is given using bivectors and not 1-vectors.

These results will be very surprising for all physicists since we are all, and
always, taught that the transformations (18) and (19) are the LT of the com-
ponents of the 3D E and B. But, the common belief is one thing and clear
mathematical facts are quite diﬀerent thing. The true agreement of these new
results with electrodynamic experiments, as shown in Refs. 2, 3 and Refs. 5,
6, substantially support the validity of the results from Refs. 1 - 3 and Refs.
5, 6. Ultimately, these new results say that the Lorentz invariant 4D geometric
quantities are physical ones, and not, as usually accepted, the 3D geometric
quantities.

SUGRA INTERACTIONS AT THRESHOLDS OF ASYMPTOTIC
FREEDOM

J. TOWE

Abstract. A generic, heterotic string theory is uniquely reduced to the stan-
dard model in terms of a geometry that transcends compactiﬁcation. This de-
vice also extends the standard model to embrace three generations of fermions,
including a left-handed strange quark that is devoid of strangeness and three
right-handed neutrinos. Finally, the proposed hypothesis indicates supergrav-
itationally mediated quark-lepton transitions that preserve baryon structure,
departing from the SUSY GUT tradition that predicts proton decay.

1. A Unique Reduction to the Standard Model

The current status of high energy physics confronts two signiﬁcant problems:
that SUSY GUT theories predict a proton decay, which is not observed, and that
heterotic string models (the only ﬁnite, physical models) of supergravity do not
uniquely reduce to the standard model at SM scale. Both problems are addressed in
terms of a geometry, which transcends compactiﬁcation by preserving the geodesic
nature of world tube coupling.

A pure supergravitational transition at string scale is envisioned as an absorption-
radiation event that is encountered by a closed string of spin 3/2, as that string
sweeps out a geodesic world tube in 10-spacetime. Each absorption-radiation event
involves the absorption of a string of spin 2 and the simultaneous radiation of a sec-
ond, generally distinct string of spin 2 through the mediation of a graviton vertex
operator (GVO). The constraint of simultaneity is necessary to conserve intrinsic
angular momentum along the world tube of spin 3/2. Two classes of spin-2 ﬁelds
and two classes of GVOs are postulated. A Class I GVO is identiﬁed with the
absorption of a Class I string of spin 2 and the radiation of a Class II string of spin
2. A Class II GVO is identiﬁed with the opposite order of absorption and radiation.
It is observed that GVOs experience ’geodesic coupling’ at string scale, where
geodesic coupling refers to coupling in terms of a world tube that is swept out by a
string of spin 3/2 (closed string analogue of a gauge ﬁeld of local supersymmetry).
In this context a transcendental geometry is deﬁned as consisting of world tubes
of spin 3/2 that map under compactiﬁcation onto spin 3/2 geodesic couplings of
GVO particle analogues (also to be known as GVOs) and of their spin 2 super-
partners. Because compactiﬁcation is deﬁned in terms of an E8 symmetry, which
breaks to yield SU(5)XSU(3) (in both observable and hidden sectors), a spin 3/2
geodesic coupling is deﬁned as one that preserves SU(5)XSU(3) as well as local su-
persymmetry and the spin-(3/2) nature of the gauge coupling. If SU(5) is deﬁned
so that the conserved parameters are I3, Y, fermion number and generation, then
the proposed hypothesis yields three fundamental representations of SU(5) in terms
of GVOs, which correspond to three orientations of the I3 axis about the Y axis,
forming a representation of SU(3) on a plane that is orthogonal to the orientations
of the SU(5) symmetries. Thus if one can constrain the spin 1 sector of each GVO

to consist exclusively of a photon, then up to constant scale factors, three genera-
tions of quarks and three generations of leptons are established. This reduction of
heterotic string theory to the standard model should be compared with a reduction
that was obtained from more traditional considerations [W. Buchm¨uller,2005].

The coordinates and corresponding gauge particles of one orientation of the I3XY

grid about the Y axis are:

tion:

(1.17)

I3 = Q + (1/2)QHC + (1/2)LHC + (1/2)LIC − (1/2)Y,

where QHC refers to ’quark hypercharge constant’, LHC refers to ’lepton hyper-
charge constant’, LIC refers to ’lepton isospin constant’ and LIC+LHC refers to
the sum. The values of these constant scale factors that are compatible with both
symmetry and internal consistency are:

LHC(RHlepton) = −2/3,

(LIC + LHC)(LHlepton) = 4/3

(LIC + LHC)(LHanti − lepton) = −4/3

(LIC + LHC)(RHlepton) = 1/3

(LIC + LHC)(RHanti − lepton) = −1/3.

This result should be compared with the traditional standard model and with the
extension of this model that includes three fermionic generations [D. Nordstrom,
1992].

The issue of proton decay is now addressed. It is generally accepted that quarks
coalesce to form triplets at about 1 TeV, and that supersymmetry is intact at scales
just above 1 TeV. It is therefore argued that the supergravitational activity, which
has been discussed, is indeed realized at scales below compactiﬁcation scale, and
speciﬁcally at scales around 1 TeV, by interactions between ﬁelds of spin 2 and
valance quarks that reside within baryons of spin 3/2. These are quarks that are
experiencing asymptotic freedom. It can be shown that such interactions include
quark-lepton interactions that preserve baryon structure; but ﬁrst the nature of the
spin-2 ﬁelds that emerge from the proposed theory must be considered. The next
section will describe such ﬁelds.

2. Specific Spin-2 Fields

The formulation of an appropriate spin-2 ﬁeld involves a GVO

and a corresponding spin-(3/2) ﬁeld

where a bar indicates an anti-ﬁeld and a prime indicates anti-alignment of an anti-
ﬁeld. If the entities 2.1 and 2.2 coalesce, then the result is clearly the spin-2 ﬁeld

charge Q(DL) + Q(e

A second spin-2 ﬁeld class is produced when the GVO

interacts with the same spin-(3/2) ﬁeld as that described by Equation 2.2 (ψDL =

′
LDLUL). In this case one obtains

The latter spin-2 ﬁeld is clearly characterized by zero mass, zero charge, is colorless
and is also characterized by I3=0. The spin-2 ﬁelds GL and gL will subsequently
be known as Class I, Type A and Class II, Type A.

Let us now consider the two GVOs

Now that spin-2 ﬁelds have been assigned speciﬁc structure, one can consider a
realization of the theory of pure supergravity which impacts the standard model.
Again the proposed realization occurs at approximately 1 TeV, where quarks are
bound into triplets. Because supersymmetry remains intact at just above 1 TeV,
it is argued that the proposed supergravitational interactions can occur between
ﬁelds of spin 2 and baryons of spin 3/2. Speciﬁcally, such interactions are regarded
as occurring between the proposed ﬁelds of spin-2 and valance quarks that reside
within baryons of spin 3/2. These are quarks that are experiencing asymptotic
freedom. Such interactions can also occur within baryons of spin 1/2 provided that
mediations are complemented by theoretically provided photons (this to preserve
local supersymmetry). Before considering the proposed interactions let us sum-
marize the above described nature of the spin-2 ﬁelds and the supergravitational
couplings that were prescribed by this section. Spin 2 ﬁelds occur in two classes: a
class that consists of elements of charge 2/3 that are characterized by a single color
and an I3 value of zero; and a class that consists of elements that are charge-less,
colorless and also characterized by I3=0. There are three types of supergravita-
tional couplings per generation: one for each pair of GVOs that share a common
value of I3 and Y; i.e. one for each type of SUGRA interaction. Interaction types
are designated A, B and C. Prototypes of the interactions that are proposed for the
1 TeV energy scale will now be considered.

3. Supergravitationally Mediated Quark-lepton Transitions

An example of the Type A interaction occurs when a left-handed down quark
A
R and radiates a
absorbs a spin-2 anti-ﬁeld of class I, Type A, also designated G
spin-2 anti-ﬁeld of class II, Type A, also designated gA
R, producing a left-handed
electron. This transition is quickly reversed so that baryon structure is preserved.
An example of a Type B interaction occurs when a left-handed up quark absorbs
B
a spin 2 anti-ﬁeld of Class I, Type B, also designated G
R and radiates a spin 2 anti-
ﬁeld of Class II, Type B, also designated gB
R to produce a colorless, left-handed
particle of spin 1/2 with a charge of zero; i.e. a left-handed electron’s neutrino. In
both cases the baryon could be a ∆0. An example of a Type C interaction occurs
when a right-handed strange quark absorbs a spin 2 anti-ﬁeld of Class I, Type
C
C (also designated G
R), generation II, and a radiates a spin 2 anti-ﬁeld of Class
II, Type C (also designated gC
R), generation II to produce a right-handed muon:
Here the baryon could be an Ω (triplet SSS). Clearly, the proposed interactions
are occurring to all generations of quarks, and are (from symmetry considerations)
generation speciﬁc.

The proposed interactions can also occur within baryons of spin-(1/2) provided
that a photon is absorbed and radiated together with each spin-2 anti-ﬁeld to
preserve local supersymmetry.

4. Conclusion

It was recalled that high energy physics confronts two important problems: that
SUSY GUT theories predict a proton decay that is not observed and that heterotic

6

string models of supergravity do not uniquely reduce to the standard model at SM
scale. Both problems were addressed in terms of a proposed diﬀerential geometry
that transcends compactiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, it was proposed that geodesic world
tubes be regarded as elements of a transcendent geometry if and only if they map
under compactiﬁcation onto ’geodesic couplings’ of GVO particle analogues, which
were subsequently referred to as GVOs. In a context where compactiﬁcation was
interpreted as a breaking of E8 which forms SU(5)XSU(3), a geodesic coupling was
deﬁned as a coupling that preserves SU(5)XSU(3) as well as local supersymmetry
and the spin-(3/2) nature of the gauge connection.

SU(5) was deﬁned so that the conserved parameters are I3, Y, fermion number
and generation. In this context the proposed hypothesis resulted in three funda-
mental representations of SU(5) on I3XY grids that were in terms of GVOs and
symmetrically oriented about one Y axis, thereby projecting onto an orthogonal
plane as a representation of SU(3). By constraining the spin 1 sector of the GVO
to consist exclusively of a photon, three generations of quarks and three generations
of leptons were established up to constant scale factors. It was concluded that the
postulated transcendent geometry had reduced a generic, heterotic string theory
to the standard model, and had extended the standard model to embrace three
generations of fermions, including a new quark and three right-handed neutrinos.
The new quark was characterized as a left-handed strange quark, which in the con-
text of what was postulated, is characterized by a baryon number of 1/3 and a
hypercharge of 1/3; i.e. by a strangeness number of zero.

Finally, the issue of proton decay was addressed. It was noted that quarks come
together to form triplets at about 1 TeV, and that supersymmetry is intact at just
above 1 TeV. It was therefore argued that the supergravitational activity, which
had been discussed, is indeed realized at scales below compactiﬁcation scale, and
speciﬁcally at a scale around 1 TeV, by interactions between ﬁelds of spin 2 and
valance quarks that reside within baryons of spin 3/2. It was emphasized that these
quarks are experiencing asymptotic freedom. Before it could be demonstrated that
such interactions produce quark-lepton transitions that preserve baryon structure,
it was necessary to consider the nature of the spin-2 ﬁelds that emerge from the
proposed theory.

It was observed that such ﬁelds occur in two categories: one consisting of ele-
ments of charge 2/3, a single color and an I3 number of zero; and a second consisting
of elements that are charge-less, colorless and also characterized by an I3 number
of zero. In this context the three indicated types of supergravitational interactions
(per generation) were considered. These interactions were described in some detail.
It was demonstrated that baryon structure is not disturbed and it was observed
that the same types of interactions can occur within baryons of spin 1/2, provided
that photons are absorbed and radiated together with each spin-2 anti-ﬁeld–this
to preserve local supersymmetry. In closing, the preservation of baryon structure
by interactions with the postulated gravitational radiation ﬁeld was compared with
preservations of atomic structure by similar interactions with the electromagnetic
radiation ﬁeld of QED.

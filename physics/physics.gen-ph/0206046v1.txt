Abstract

Based on the model of Expansive Nondecelerative Universe, the
aim of the present contribution is to contribute to the theoretical ra-
tionalization of some experiments, in particular of those performed by
Podkletnov and de Aquino and devoted to the gravitational mass ces-
sation, to oﬀer a mechanistic explanation of the Solar corona heating,
and to propose an experiment to verify the explanation of the heating
in the Earth conditions.

Introduction

Among the problems of current physics, issues concerning gravity are still
ranked in “top ten”. Theoretical approaches focused on elaboration of a the-
ory of quantum gravitation unifying all four (or more?) fundamental forces
are in progress, successful completion of the theory seems to be, however, far
beyond the horizon. Simultaneously with theoretical attempts (for a general
survey, see [1]), experiments aimed at inﬂuencing the gravitational mass by
other forces have been developed and tentatively explained [2-8]. The gravity
has penetrated also into chemistry as manifested by space-craft experiments

1

(preparation of compounds, alloys or mixtures that, due to the gravitational
force acting at the Earth, cannot be prepared in the Earth conditions) as well
as by a newly elaborated rationalization of some quantum chemical eﬀects
[9-10].

A carefull inspection of the contributions devoted to experiments involv-
ing gravitational eﬀects [2-7] may lead the reader to a conclusion on the
necessity to introduce a theoretical approach diﬀerent of those applied in
the original papers. It concerns, namely, an approach based on the general
theory of relativity and beneﬁting from the ability to localize and quantify
the gravitational energy. The Expansive Nondecelerative Universe (ENU)
model [8,11-13] satisﬁes the above requirements. The purpose of the present
contribution is to contribute to the rationalization of some experiments, in
particular of those performed by Podkletnov [2-4] and de Aquino [5-7], to
oﬀer a mechanistic explanation of the Solar corona heating, and to propose
an experiment enabling to verify the explanation in the Earth conditions.

Podkletnov’s phenomenon

In the papers by Podkletnov [2-4] a detection of an anomalous force origi-
nating at a high-voltage discharge directed from a superconductive emitter
to a target electrode is described. The eﬀect has been attributed to forces of
gravitational nature. At the Podkletnov’s experiments, the following condi-
tions were applied: the discharge time was 10−5 to 10−4 s, the current peak
value at the discharge was of the order 104 A, the voltage varied from 500
kV to 2 MV, the interelectrode distance ranged from 15 cm to 2 m, the total
charge of the emitter was about 0.1 C, and the discharge energy approached
105 J. The formed gravitational impulse propagated as a coherent beam in
the same direction as the discharge. It penetrates through diﬀerent media,
apparently without any energy loss and caused a deﬂection of a 10 - 50 g
pendulum. The energy of the deﬂection was independent on the pendulum
material and mass, and depended on the voltage only.

One of the possible explanations of the Podkletnov’s phenomenon was
oﬀered in [8]. At the Podkletnov’s experiments, a mean intensity of the
electrostatic ﬁeld was

E ∼= 2.5 × 106 V m−1

(1)

which corresponds to a mean energy density

εe

∼= 27 J m−3

As shown in [8], energy density of gravitational ﬁeld at the Earth surface is

|εg| =

Rc4
8πG

=

3m(Earth)c2
4πar2

(Earth)

= 24.29 J m−3

where R is the scalar curvature, a is the gauge factor, m(Earth) and r(Earth)
are the Earth mass and radius, respectively. Based on (2) and (3) it follows

The Earth gravitational ﬁeld interferes with the electrostatic ﬁeld created
in the Podkletnov’s equipment which leads to a local cessation of the gravi-
tational ﬁeld. The corresponding deviation from the vertical direction of the
gravity causes the observed pendulum deﬂection. In [8] it was proved that
the deﬂection in vertical direction, hv is described by

(5)

where g is the Earth surface gravitational acceleration (9.80665 m s−2) and
Q is the total charge of the emitter.

Solar corona

The temperature proﬁle of the Sun and its surroundings belongs still to the
enigmas of physics. At the core of the Sun, the temperature reaches about
15 million K which is understandable since energy is created in the Sun.
Passing from the core to the surface the temperature decreases and at the
Sun’s surface it is about 5,500 K. Next part (outside of the chromosphere) is
corona. There is no source of energy, its temperature, however, is extremely
high (about 1 million K [14]). The question is, what mechanism is applied
at the corona heating, preserving thus its temperature? This part oﬀers a
possible explanation.

The mean magnetic ﬁeld intensity at the Sun’s surface is [15]

¯H ∼= 102 A m−1

εe

and during some processes the intensity may increase in sunspots up to

A magnetic ﬁeld intensity with a density identical to the gravitational energy
density on the Sun’s surface is the critical density Hcrit reaching

Hmax

∼= 105 A m−1

Hcrit

∼= 4 × 104 A m−1

Bcrit

∼= 5 × 10−2 T

which corresponds to the critical magnetic induction

Interference of the gravitational and magnetic ﬁelds can lead to origina-
tion of a gravitational impulse that can increase the kinetic energy of the
particles forming the Solar corona, i.e. its temperature. The mechanism of
the corona ”heating” may be, therefore, similar to that of the Podkletnov’s
phenomena. The diﬀerence is that instead of pendulum and electrostatic
discharge, rather plasma particles and magnetic impulses are in action, i.e.

At the Podkletnov’s experiments, along with a high voltage, also a dis-
charge must be created. Similarly, the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld with Bcrit must
inﬂuence on the particles (electrons) and induce their precession with the
frequency

where me is the electron mass. In order no avoid damping, the mentioned
precession must equal to the plasma frequency ωpl [16] in a given region

where ne(Sun) denotes a concentration of the electrons with a given precession
frequency in a space.

In order the Podkletnov’s phenomenon may occur, a region with the
concentration of the plasma electrons of ne(Sun) must be just near the Sun

surface where at Bcrit given by (9) the electrons will have identical precession
and plasma frequencies. Based on (10)–(12) it follows

ne(Sun) =

3m(Sun)
2πmear2

(Sun)

∼= 1016 m−3

(13)

Experimental observation of the Sun and its environment has brought
an evidence that such a region (the boundary of chromosphere and corona)
really exists. Thus, just in this region, conditions for the corona heating by
the Podkletnov’s phenomenon are satisﬁed (as a matter of fact, there is no
other place where they might exist).

A model experiment

The above conclusions on the conditions required to heat the Solar corona
may be experimentally veriﬁed in a laboratory. Here, such an experiment
is suggested. The gravitational energy density at the Earth surface (24.29 J
m−3 [8]) equals to magnetic ﬁeld density when

Hcrit(Earth) = 7.000 × 103 A m−1

(14)

or

Bcrit(Earth) = 8.796 × 10−3 T
Applying (13) to the conditions at the Earth surface leads to the value of con-
centration of electrons in the plasma with identical the plasma and electron
precession frequencies

(15)

ne(Earth)

∼= 5.5 × 1014 m−3

(16)

Such a concentration of free electrons is present in a sample of hydrogen
containing 3.9×1021 hydrogen atoms in a cubic meter when being at the tem-
perature of 3000 K. This sample is exposed to a pulsing magnetic ﬁeld with
Bcrit given by (15). In the direction of the magnetic poles, a second sample of
hydrogen (room temperature, concentration about 1020 in a cubic meter) will
be placed next to the ﬁrst sample. After some time of magnetic ﬁeld pulsing,
the temperature of the second sample should increase. The temperature of
the control samples placed in other directions should be preserved.

Rationalization of experiments performed by
de Aquino

Stemming from the special relativity theory and classical physics, de Aquino
[17] discussed relations between the inertial and gravitational masses. Using
a very detailed and precise mathematical treatment he manifested that in the
absence of electromagnetic ﬁeld, the masses are identical. In the presence of
such a ﬁeld, the gravitational mass may be reduced or even nulliﬁed.

In his experiment [5], de Aquino worked with dics-shaped organic lumi-
nescent material. According to quantum statistical mechanics, an average
number of photons forming the photon gas inside a luminescent material is
given as

(cid:16)
where λe and λ(hν) are the Compton wavelength of the electron,

¯N(hν) =

−1

exp(λe/λ(hν)) − 1
(cid:17)

λe = 2.42 × 10−12 m

qand a mean wavelength of a photon emitted or absorbed by a luminescent
material, respectively.

In the experiment, a material emitting blue light with

was used. The radiation output of the material is expressed as

λ(hν) = 461 nm

P(hν) = ¯N(hν)hν2 =

hc2

λ2

(hν)

exp((λe/λ(hν)) − 1

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Based on (18)–(20) it can be calculated that for the radiation of 461 nm
wavelength

P(hν)

∼= 56 W

The ENU model provides a general relation [18] for the gravitational output
of a body with the mass m

where the present cosmological time calculated by the ENU model is [12]

A general condition for the interference of the electromagnetic and grav-

itational ﬁelds may be expressed as

Stemming from (20)–(24), the ENU provides a total mass of the electrolu-
minescent disc

In the de Aquino’s experiment [5] the discs of a mass

P(hν) = |Pg|

m(disc,calc)

∼= 267 kg

m(disc,exp)

∼= 264 kg

were used. Thus, the ENU based calculated and experimental masses coin-
cide.

If both approaches are consistent, equation (22) can be exploited to cal-
culate a more precise value of the cosmological time and such a calculation
leads to

tc = 4.169 × 1017] s = 1.32 × 1010 years

(27)

At the same time, the above rationalization leads to a conclusion on a

time dependence of the vacuum permittivity εo and permeability µo.

In the Podkletnov’s experiments, the electromagnetic ﬁeld interferes with
the Earth gravitational ﬁeld. In case of the experiments carried out by de
Aquino, the electromagnetic ﬁeld interferes with the gravitational ﬁeld of a
body.

Relation (24) is applicable also for the experiment [5] with radiation of
extra-low frequency (ELF) acting on a ferromagnetic material. It this case
it must hold

ηRaI 2 =

mF ec2
tc

η = 3.17 × 10−3

where Ra is the antenna impedance (116 mΩ), I is the current (130 A), mF e
is the mass of iron powder (29 kg). In such a case the absorption coeﬃcient
is

For the iron powder used at the experiment, conductivity gradient σ = 10 S
m−1, µ = 75µo and for the frequency 60 Hz, the skin layer thickness is

∼= 2.43 m

The thickness of the iron powder then must be

d = ηδ ∼= 8 mm

which is in an excellent agreement with the experimental value.

The above mentioned ideas may be applied also in the ﬁeld of thermody-
namics. In the centre of stars (e.g. the Sun) the gravitational and radiation
energies must be balanced, i.e.

3m(Sun)c2

where rg(Sun) is the gravitational radius of the Sun (∼= 3 × 103 m), σSB
(cid:12)
is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 × 10−8 kg s−3 K−4), T(Sun) is the
temperature in the centre of the Sun. Relation (32) leads to

T(Sun)

∼= 1.5 × 107 K

which is identical (within the degree of accuracy of its estimation) to that
published in various literature sources [e.g. 19].

In one of the latest de Aquino’s contributions [20], changes in the gravi-
tational mass of a body due to its interaction with electromagnetic radiation
of very low frequency are described and measured. The used antenna was
a half-wave dipole encapsulated in an iron sphere (made from 99.95% iron,
µ = 5000µo, σ = 1.03×107 S m−1). The antenna impedance was 8.29×10−6 Ω
and the 9.9 mHz radiation emitted by the antenna was completely absorbed
by the iron along a critical thickness 0.110 m.

De Aquino mathematically predicted a dependence of the iron sphere
gravitational mass on current, and experimentally proved that the total mass
of the iron sphere (inertial mass of 60.5 kg) is nulliﬁed just at the current of
8.51 A.

To rationalize this experiment case, instead of comparison of the outputs
expressed by equation (24) rather energies are to be related. The reason is a
relatively long time of radiation passage (about 16 s) through the iron layer.
The gravitational energy density associated with a 60.5 kg iron sphere

with a 0.110 m radius is

a = 1.399 × 1026 m

At interference of the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds of iron sphere,
each iron atom absorbs the energy hν and thus the total electromagnetic
energy in the iron sphere will be

where m(atom) is the mass of an iron atom. Identity of (35) and (36) leads to

Relation (37) is valid when the gauge factor

which is in excellent agreement with its value calculated using the ENU model
[12]. This value corresponds to the cosmological time

In this way, the de Aquino experiments and the ENU model provide an

interval of the cosmological time

tc = (1.32 − 1.48) × 1010 years

In case of more experimental data available, the cosmological time can

be calculated more precisely.

The above conclusions can be taken as a challenge both for those planning
and performing experiments and those elaborating theoretical approaches.
The given data manifest a mutual coherence of the Podkletnov’s, de Aquino’s
and ours approaches. In addition, they bring a clear evidence of the necessity
to exploit the general theory of relativity so as to understand and rationalize
experiments devoted to gravitational mass changes.

The diﬀerence of the rest masses m(π±) − m(µ±) is nearly equal to 1/4 of the rest
mass of the π± mesons and is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the 0.7·109
muon neutrinos (respectively anti-muon neutrinos) which are in the cubic lattice
of the π± mesons according to the standing wave model. In the decay of a π+
or π− meson all muon neutrinos, respectively anti-muon neutrinos, of the cubic
lattice of the π± mesons are emitted. The sum of the oscillation energies of all
neutrinos in the π± mesons is the same as the sum of the oscillation energies of the
remaining neutrinos in the µ± mesons. Consequently the mass of the µ± mesons
is equal to m(π±) − 0.7 · 109 m(νµ) ≈ 0.75 m(π±), within 1% in agreement with
the measured ratio m(µ±) / m(π±) = 0.757028.

1 Introduction

In a previous paper [1] we have found that the ratios of the masses of the
so-called stable mesons and baryons of the γ-branch of the spectrum of the
stable elementary particles are integer multiples of the mass of the π0 meson
within, on the average, 0.73%. We have explained this empirical fact with
the standing wave model [2]. The ratios of the masses of the neutrino branch
of the stable particle spectrum are integer multiples of the mass of the π±
mesons times a common factor 0.86 ± 0.02 [1]. We have explained the ratios
of the masses of the particles of the ν-branch with the standing wave model
in [3]. Surprisingly we can also explain the ratio of the mass of the µ± mesons
to the mass of the π± mesons with the standing wave model.

2 The mass of the muons

The mass of the µ± mesons is m(µ±) = 105.658389 ± 3.4·10−5 MeV, according
to the Particle Physics Summary [4]. The muons are stable, their lifetime
is τµ = 2.19703 · 10−6 ± 4 · 10−11 sec, about a hundred times as long as the

1

lifetime of the π± mesons, that means longer than the lifetime of any other
elementary particle, but for the electrons, protons and neutrons. The muons
are part of the lepton family which is distinguished from the mesons and
baryons not so much by their mass as the name lepton implies, actually the
mass of the τ meson is about twice the mass of the proton, but rather by the
absence of strong interaction with the mesons and baryons. The masses of
the leptons are not explained by the standard model of the particles.

Comparing the mass of the µ± mesons to the mass of the π± mesons
m(π±) = 139.56995 MeV we ﬁnd that m(µ±)/m(π±) = 0.757028 ≈ 3/4 or
that m(π±) − m(µ±) = 33.91156 MeV = 0.24297·m(π±) or ≈ 1/4 · m(π±).
The mass of the electron is approximately 1/206 of the mass of the muon,
the contribution of m(e) to m(µ) will therefore be neglected in the following.
We assume, as we have done in [2] and [3] and as appears to be natural,
that the particles, including the muons, consist of the particles into which
they decay. The µ+ meson decays via µ+ → e+ + ¯νµ + νe. The muons are
apparently composed primarily of the neutrinos which are already present
in the cubic neutrino lattice of the π± mesons according to the standing
wave model [3]. The π+ meson decays via π+ → µ+ + νµ or the conjugate
particles in the decay of the π− meson, with 99.988% of the π± decays in this
form. The energy m(π±) − m(µ±) ≈ 1/4 · m(π±) is lost when a µ+ meson
and a muon neutrino νµ, respectively a µ− and an anti-muon neutrino ¯νµ,
are emitted by the π± mesons. The rest of the energy in the rest mass of
the π± mesons passes to the rest mass of the µ± mesons. In the standing
wave model of the particles of the neutrino branch [3] the π± mesons are
composed of a cubic lattice consisting of N/2 = 0.71·109 muon neutrinos νµ
and the same number of anti-muon neutrinos ¯νµ, (m(νµ) = m(¯νµ)), as well as
of N/2 electron neutrinos νe and the same number of anti-electron neutrinos
¯νe, (m(νe) = m(¯νe)), plus the oscillation energy of these neutrinos. We found
in [3] that the mass of a single muon neutrino should be 50 milli-eV/c2, and
the mass of a single electron neutrino should be 5 meV/c2. Using these values
of N and of the neutrino masses we ﬁnd two intriguing “coincidences”.

(a) The diﬀerence of the rest masses of the π± and µ± mesons is nearly
equal to the sum of the rest masses of all muon neutrinos respectively anti-
muon neutrinos in the π± mesons.

m(π±) − m(µ±) = 33.912 MeV versus N/2 · m(νµ) = 35.675 MeV.

(b) The energy in the oscillations of all neutrinos in the π± mesons is

2

nearly the same as the energy in the oscillations of all ¯νµ, respectively νµ,
and νe and ¯νe neutrinos in the µ± mesons.

Eosc(π±) = m(π±) − N[m(νµ) + m(νe)] = 61.09 MeV versus
Eosc(µ±) = m(µ±) − N/2 · m(¯νµ) − Nm(νe) = 62.85 MeV.

Both statements are, of course, valid only within the accuracy with which
the number 2N of all neutrinos in the π± lattice is known, as well as within
the accuracy with which the masses m(νµ) and m(νe) have been determined
in [3]. It cannot be expected that this accuracy is better than a few percent,
considering in particular the uncertainty of the lattice constant.

In the two-body decay of the π± mesons each decay product has the
same and speciﬁc momentum p which is p = 30 MeV/c in the rest frame,
according to the Particle Physics Summary [4]. The momentum of the decay
particles translates into a kinetic energy which for the µ mesons is Ek(µ±)
= 4.1 MeV, and for the single emitted muon neutrino with a practically
vanishing rest mass Ek(νµ) = 30 MeV. Hence the kinetic energies of the two
decay products of the π± meson is 34.1 MeV, which is, as must be, practically
equal to m(π±) − m(µ±) = 33.9 MeV. In terms of our model of the neutrino
lattice in the π± mesons and the statement (a) above this means that the
rest masses of all muon neutrinos in the π± mesons are converted into kinetic
energy. All but one of the 0.7 · 109 muon neutrinos disappear in the decay of
the cubic neutrino lattice of the π± mesons. We learn from the high energy
collision e+ + e− → µ+ + µ− that µ mesons, and the neutrinos which are part
of the µ meson masses, can be created directly out of the kinetic energy of
the electrons and positrons in the e+ + e− collision. What we observe in the
π± decay is the reverse process, the conversion of the energy in neutrino rest
masses into kinetic energy.

We note that the diﬀerence of the rest masses m(π±) −m(µ±) provides an
independent check of the value of the rest mass of the muon neutrino. Using
N/2 = 0.7135·109 and m(π±) − m(µ±) = 33.912 MeV it follows that the rest
mass of the muon neutrino should be m(νµ) = 47.53 meV/c2, whereas we
found m(νµ) = 50 meV/c2 in [3].

Since the decay of the π± mesons seems to mean the removal of all νµ,
respectively, all ¯νµ neutrinos from the neutrino lattice of the π± mesons, the
muons should contain the remaining neutrinos of the original cubic lattice,
that means N/2 anti-muon neutrinos ¯νµ, respectively, N/2 muon neutrinos
νµ, plus N/2 electron neutrinos νe as well as N/2 anti-electron neutrinos ¯νe.
It can be shown immediately that the concept that the muons consist of three

3

types of neutrinos and their oscillation energies leads to the correct mass of
the muons. The energy E in the rest mass of the µ mesons must be equal to
the oscillation or average kinetic energy of all neutrinos in the particle plus
the energy in the rest masses of the neutrinos. From E = Ek + Σm(ν)c2
follows the elementary formula Eq.(18) in [3], which applied to the case of
the muons is

E(µ±)
E(π±)

=

Ek(µ±)
Ek(π±)

· 1 + Σm′c2/Ek(µ±)
1 + Σmc2/Ek(π±)

.

(1)

With the empirical Ek(µ±) = m(µ±)0c2 − Σm′c2 = 62.9 MeV and the em-
pirical Ek(π±) = m(π±)0c2 − Σmc2 = 61.1 MeV, where Σm′c2 = N/2 · 50
meV + N · 5 meV (the sum of the energies of the rest masses of the anti-muon
neutrinos, electron neutrinos and anti-electron neutrinos in the µ+ meson),
and Σmc2 = N · 50 meV + N · 5 meV (the sum of the energies of the rest
masses of the four neutrino types in the π± mesons), it follows that

E(µ±)/E(π±) = 0.75763 ,
(2)
whereas the measured ratio is E(µ±)/E(π±) = 0.757028. That means that
the concept of the muons consisting of three neutrino types plus their oscilla-
tion or kinetic energy leads to the correct ratio of the mass of the µ± mesons
to the mass of the π± mesons.

3 The oscillation energies of the neutrinos

The neutrinos in the body of a muon must oscillate because the collision
e++e− → µ++µ− tells that a continuum of frequencies must be present in the
muons, if Fourier analysis holds. The continuum of frequencies from Fourier
analysis can be absorbed by the continuous spectrum of the oscillations in
a neutrino lattice. The energy of the oscillations of the neutrinos in the
muon lattice is the sum of the energies of a plane oscillation in an isotropic,
diatomic lattice consisting of N/2 ¯νµ neutrinos and N/2 νe neutrinos, part of
the remains of the diatomic neutrino lattice of the π± mesons, plus the energy
of the diatomic oscillations of N/2 ¯νµ and N/2 ¯νe neutrinos which neutrinos
were likewise in the lattice of the π± mesons. The latter oscillations are
likely to be perpendicular to the ﬁrst mentioned diatomic oscillations in the
muon, because the ¯νe, νe neutrino pairs are oriented perpendicular to the ¯νµ,

¯νe neutrino pairs in the original cubic lattice of the π± mesons, see Fig. 1 of
[3].

The energy of the oscillations of the lattice is given by

−π

f (φ1, φ2) dφ1 dφ2 ,

(3)

as in Eq.(17) of [3] or in the original paper of Born and v.Karman [5], Eq.(50)
therein. The oscillation energy of the diatomic lattice containing the ¯νµ and
νe neutrinos of the µ± mesons is 1/2 of the oscillation energy of the diatomic
lattice oscillations in the π± mesons because the number of the pairs ¯νµ and
νe in the µ± mesons is 1/2 of the number of the corresponding pairs ¯νµ
and νe and νµ and ¯νe in the π± mesons. The functions f(φ1, φ2) in Eq.(3)
describing the frequency spectrum of the oscillations are the same for the
diatomic neutrino pairs in the π± mesons and the diatomic neutrino pairs
in the µ± mesons. The functions are given by Eq.(6) of [3]. Since both
functions are the same the ratio of the energy in the diatomic ¯νµ, νe lattice
oscillation of the µ± mesons to the energy of the diatomic lattice oscillations
in the π± mesons is = 1/2 according to Eq.(3). But since the same applies
for the diatomic oscillations of the ¯νµ, ¯νe pairs in the µ± mesons, the sum of
the energies of both oscillations is equal to the oscillation energy of the π±
mesons, as (b) says.

Since the frequencies of the diatomic oscillations are a quadratic func-
tion of ν there exists for each positive frequency also a negative frequency
of the same absolute value. That means, according to (3), that the sum of
the energies of the oscillations with negative frequencies is negative, but has
the same absolute value as the sum of the energies of the oscillations with
positive frequencies. That means that each muon has an antiparticle. In the
antiparticle of a particular muon the oscillation energy of the neutrinos is
replaced by the oscillation energy of the frequencies with the opposite sign,
and the masses of the neutrinos are replaced by the masses of their antineu-
trinos, which have the same absolute value of the masses they replaced. The
energy in the mass of a muon is consequently equal to the energy in the mass
of its antiparticle, as it is with the masses of the particles of the γ-branch
and of the ν-branch, and with the masses of the µ+ and µ− mesons.

Finally we ask why do the muons not interact strongly with the mesons
and baryons? In [6] we have shown that a strong force emanates from the
sides of a cubic lattice. This force is caused by the unsaturated weak forces
of about 106 neutrinos at a side of the surface of the neutrino lattice of the

5

mesons and baryons. The existence of such a force follows from the study
of Born and Stern [7] which dealt with the forces between two parts of a
cubic lattice cleaved in vacuum. If the muons have a lattice consisting of ¯νµ,
respectively νµ, and νe and ¯νe neutrinos the lattice surface is not the same
as the surface of the cubic νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe lattice of the mesons and baryons,
as described by the standing wave model [2,3]. Therefore it does not seem
likely that the muons interact in the same way with the mesons and baryons
as the mesons and baryons interact with each other. To put this in another
way, a triclinic lattice does not bond with a cubic lattice.

4 Conclusions

It has been shown that the mass of the muons can be explained as the
sum of the rest masses of 0.71 · 109 muon neutrinos, respectively anti-muon
neutrinos, and of the same number of electron neutrinos and anti-electron
neutrinos, plus their oscillation energies. The three neutrino types in a muon
are the remains of the cubic neutrino lattice of the π± mesons from which the
muons are formed in the π± decay. The mass of the muons diﬀers from the
mass of the π± mesons by the sum of the rest masses of all muon neutrinos,
respectively of all anti-muon neutrinos which are in the π± mesons. All
muon neutrinos of one type are emitted when the π± mesons decay. Since
the sum of the rest masses of all muon neutrinos of one type in the π±
mesons is approximately 1/4 of the rest mass of π± mesons, and since the
oscillation energies in π± and µ± are the same, the mass remaining in the µ±
mesons after the π± decay is ≈ 3/4 · m(π±), within 1% in agreement with
the measured ratio m(µ±)/m(π±) = 0.757028. We have also found that the
muons do not interact with the mesons and baryons in the same strong way
as the mesons and baryons interact with each other.

The explanation of the mass of the muons and of their weak interaction
is a straightforward consequence of our standing wave model of the stable
mesons and baryons.

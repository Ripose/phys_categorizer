In order to verify a possibility of a dc voltage predicted on segments of an inhomogeneous supercon-
ducting loop the Little-Parks oscillations are investigated on symmetrical and asymmetric Al loops.
The amplitude of the voltage oscillations ∆V measured on segments of symmetrical loop increases
with the measuring current Im and ∆V = 0 at Im = 0 in accordance with the classical Little-Parks
experiment. Whereas the ∆V measured on segments of asymmetric loop has a maximum value at
Im = 0. The observation of the dc voltage at Im = 0 means that one of the loop segments is a dc
power source and others is a load. The dc power can be induced by both thermal ﬂuctuation and a
external electric noise.

w = 0.2 and 0.4 µm at the dc measuring current Im
and diﬀerent temperature closed to Tc. Here B is the
magnetic induction produced by the coil; S = πr2 is
the area of the loop. The sheet resistance of the loops
was equal approximately 0.5 Ω/⋄ at 4.2 K, the resistance
ratio R(300K)/R(4.2K) ≈ 2 and the midpoint of the
superconducting resistive transition Tc ≈ 1.24 K. All
loops exhibited the anomalous features of the resistive
dependencies on temperature and magnetic ﬁeld which
was observed on mesoscopic Al structures in some works
[8,9] before. We assume that these features can be con-
nected with big value of the Al superconducting coher-
ence length which can exceed a structure size near Tc.

Recently thought-provoking claims were made about
violation of the second law of thermodynamics in the
quantum regime [1–3]. These claims were made inde-
pendently by three research teams from diﬀerent lands
and are concerned to diﬀerent branches of knowledge
such as quantum thermodynamics, biomolecules, super-
conductivity and others. The publication of such sensa-
tion statement has attracted the attention of the scientiﬁc
press [4] but most scientists still are not buying [5] the
theoretical arguments presented in [1–3].

The present work is devoted to the experimental veri-
ﬁcation of a theoretical result [6] according to which a dc
voltage can be observed on segments of a inhomogeneous
superconducting loop at T ≈ Tc without any external
current. The value and sign of this dc voltage depend
in a periodic way on a magnetic ﬂux Φ within the loop
Vos(Φ/Φ0). The work [6] was provoked by an experi-
mental observation [7] which is not published up to now,
however. According to the opinion [3] by one of the au-
thors of the present and [6] works the existence of the dc
voltage contradicts to the second law if Vos(Φ/Φ0) is in-
duced by the thermal ﬂuctuations in the thermodynamic
equilibrium state.

In order to verify the result [6] we used the mesoscopic
Al structures, one of them is shown on Fig.1. These mi-
crostructures are prepared using an electron lithograph
developed on the basis of a JEOL-840A electron scanning
microscop. An electron beam of the lithograph was con-
trolled by a PC, equipped with a software package for
proximity eﬀect correction ”PROXY”. The exposition
was made at 25 kV and 30 pA. The resist was developed
in MIBK: IPA = 1: 5, followed by the thermal deposi-
tion of a high-purity Al ﬁlm 60 nm and lift-oﬀ in ace-
tone. The substrates are Si wafers. The measurements
are performed in a standard helium-4 cryostat allowing
us to vary the temperature down to 1.2 K. The applied
magnetic ﬁeld, which is produced by a superconducting
coil, never exceeded 35 Oe. The voltage variations down
to 0.05 µV could be detected.

We have investigated the dependencies of the dc volt-
age V on the magnetic ﬂux Φ ≈ BS of some round loops
with a diameter 2r = 1, 2 and 4 µm and a linewidth

samples. I1 and V1 are the current and potential contacts of
the symmetrical loop. I2 and V2 are the current and poten-
tial contacts of the asymmetric loop. V3 are the additional
potential contacts of the asymmetric loop.

According to [6] the dc voltage can observed in a in-
homogeneous loop and should not observed in a homo-
geneous one. In order to investigate the inﬂuence of the

1

heterogeneity of loop segments we made both symmetri-
cal and asymmetric loops in each investigated structure
(see Fig.1). Because of the additional potential contacts
the higher and lower segments of the lower loop (on Fig.1)
can have a diﬀerent resistance at T ≃ Tc when the mag-
netic ﬂux Φ contained within a loop is not divisible by
the ﬂux quantum Φ0 = π¯hc/e, i.e. Φ 6= nΦ0, whereas the
one of the higher loop should have the same resistance if
any accidental heterogeneity is absent.

on other our loops and in other works [9].

According to the universally recognized explanation
[11] the LP resistance oscillations are observed [8] be-
cause of the ﬂuxoid quantization [10,12]. The resistance
increase at Φ 6= nΦ0 is interpreted as a consequence of
the Tc decrease at a non-zero velocity of superconducting
pairs vs 6= 0: ∆R = −(dR(T −Tc)/dT )∆Tc ∝ (dR/dT )v2

[11]. Because of the quantization

the vs circulation can not be equal zero at Φ = BS +

sponded to the bottom of the resistive transition

The voltage oscillations measured on the V1 contacts
Fig.2 and on the V2 contacts Fig.3 conﬁrm qualitative dif-
ference between the symmetrical and asymmetric loops.
In the ﬁrst case the amplitude ∆V of the voltage os-
cillations increases with the measuring current Im and
the oscillations are not observed at Im = 0. Whereas in
the second case the greatest oscillations are observed at
Im = 0 and the ∆V value does not increase with the Im,
Fig.3. Not only the voltage value but also the sign of the
voltage are changed with the magnetic ﬁeld at Im = 0,
Figs.3,4.

In the present work we consider only the re-
gion |Φ/Φ0| < 7 where the dependencies V ≈
Rm(Φ/Φ0, T /Tc(Im))Im Fig.2 corresponds to the classi-
cal Little-Parks (LP) experiment [10]. The anomalous
behaviour, the downfall observed before the disappear-
ance of the oscillation Fig.2, will be considered later. In
contrast to the classical LP experiment no resistance but
voltage oscillations are observed on the asymmetric loop:
V ≈ Vos(Φ/Φ0) + RnosIm Fig.3. The resistance Rnos de-
pends faintly on Im and on the magnetic ﬁeld at low Im
Fig.3. At a high Im value the negative magnetoresistance
Rnos is observed Fig.3. Such anomaly was observed also

dence ∆Tc ∝ −(n−Φ/Φ0)2
min, where n is corresponded to
minimum possible value v2
s ∝ (n − Φ/Φ0)2 [11] describes
enough well the experimental data (see for example Fig.4
in [8]). Therefore (n − Φ/Φ0) ≈ (n − Φ/Φ0)min when Φ
is not close to (n + 0.5)Φ0. Isc = 0 at Φ = (n + 0.5)Φ0
because the permitted states with opposite vs direction
have the same v2
s value. Thus, the LP experiment is evi-
dence of the persistent screening current Ip.c. = Isc ﬂows
along the loop at a constant magnetic ﬂux, Φ 6= nΦ0 and
Φ 6= (n + 0.5)Φ0, and Rl 6= 0.

It is enough obvious from the analogy with a con-
ventional loop that the potential diﬀerence Vsc = (<

ls of an inhomogeneous loop at jsc if the average re-
sistivity along the segment < ρ >ls=

from the one along the loop < ρ >l=
R
the Isc(Φ/Φ0) oscillations take place both in the sym-
metrical and asymmetric loops the absence of the volt-
age oscillations at Im = 0 on the contacts V1 Fig.2 and
the observation on V2 Figs.3,4 mean that Rhs = Rls in
the ﬁrst case and Rhs 6= Rls in the second case. The
later can be if the critical temperature of the higher and
lower segments are diﬀerent:
if Tch(Φ) 6= Tcl(Φ) then
Rhs(T − Tch) 6= Rls(T − Tcl) at T ≈ Tch, Tcl.

Consequently, the voltage oscillations at Im = 0
Fig.3,4 can be caused by the superconducting screen-
ing current, as well as the LP oscillations Fig.2. The
comparison of the experimental data for symmetrical and
asymmetric loops conﬁrms this supposition. Our inves-
tigations have shown that the voltage oscillations as well
as the LP oscillations were observed only in the tem-
peratures corresponded to the resistive transition. Both
oscillations have the same period. The magnetic ﬁeld
regions, where they are observed, are also closed.

The oscillations on Fig.2 are observed in more wide
magnetic ﬁeld region than on Figs.3,4 because the width
of the wire deﬁning the loop in the ﬁrst case w = 0.2 µm
is smaller than in the second case w = 0.4 µm. In any real
case only some oscillations are observed because a high
magnetic ﬁeld breaks down the superconductivity, i.e Isc,
in the wire deﬁning the loop and the contact grounds.
According to (1) vs = (π¯h/m)Br/2 along the loop and
vs = (π¯h/m)Bw/2 along the boundaries of the wire at
n = 0. Therefore a limited number of oscillations ∝
2r/w are observed. The wide contact grounds, with the
width ≈ 2 µm (see Fig.1), have also an inﬂuence on the

oscillation number.

According to the analogy with a conventional loop
the voltage measured between the V2 contacts Vsc =
0.5(Rhs − Rls)Isc and consequently the voltage oscilla-
tions with the amplitude ∆V ≈ 1 µV observed on Fig.4
can be induced by Isc oscillations with ∆Isc ≥ 0.4 µA
because Rhs, Rls ≤ Rln/2 = 5 Ω. The screening current
|Isc| inducing the Rm oscillations Fig.2 can be evaluate
from the experimental data if the dRm/d|Isc| value is
known. Although |Im/2 + Isc| > |Im/2| in one of the
segments and |Im/2 − Isc| < |Im/2| in the other one
at |Im/2| > |Isc| dRm/d|Isc| > 0 and the LP oscilla-
tions are observed at both small and large Im (see Fig.2
and [8]) because Isc, as well Im, decreases the probabil-
ity of superconducting state < n−1
s >−16= 0 and conse-
If one as-
quently increases the P (Rhs 6= 0, Rls 6= 0).
sumes that the dRm/d|Im| and dRm/d|Isc| are closed in
order of value then according to the data presented on
Fig.2 |Isc| ≈ 0.4 µA at Φ = (n + 0.5)Φ0.

FIG. 4. Oscillation of the voltage measured on the V2 con-
tacts (upper curve) and on the V3 contacts (lower curve) of
the asymmetric loop with 2r = 4 µm and w = 0.4 µm. Im = 0.
T = 1.231K corresponded to the bottom of the resistive tran-
sition.

Thus, the analogy with a conventional loop and the
classical LP experiment Fig.2 explain enough well the
voltage oscillations observed at Im = 0 Figs.3,4. But
in contrast to the case of the conventional loop when
the current Isc = Rl(−1/c)dΦ/dt and the electric ﬁeld
E = − ▽ V − (1/c)dA/dt = − ▽ V − (1/cl)dΦ/dt have
the same direction in both segment in our case dΦ/dt = 0
and consequently the average current Isc and the average
electric ﬁeld E = −▽V should have opposite directions
l dl ▽V ≡ 0. This means
in one of the segments because
that one of the loop segments is a dc power source W =
R
VosIsc and others is a load.

The existence of the dc power contradicts to some ha-
bitual knowledge if W is not induced by a temperature

3

diﬀerence ∆T . The voltage oscillations Fig.4 can be
explain by an accidental temperature diﬀerence Vos =
Sth∆T only if the thermopower Sth is oscillated and its
sign is switched together with the Isc. The thermopower
oscillations are observed in some Andreev interferometer
[13] but its value is very small in order to explain the
voltage oscillations observed in our work.

Because the voltage and LP oscillations are observed
in the same region it is naturally to explain the obser-
vation of the dc power as a direct consequence of the
contradiction of the LP experiment with the Ohm’s law
l dlE = −(1/c)dΦ/dt and other fundamental
RlIsc =

laws [14]. The existence of Isc 6= 0 at Rl
6= 0 and
dΦ/dt = 0 is explained [14] by the change of the momen-

s >−1= 0 to

These momentum changes because of the quantization
n2π¯h − (2e/c)Φ = 2π¯h(n − Φ/Φ0) take the place of the
Faraday’s voltage −(1/c)dΦ/dt. The force maintaining
the persistent current, as well as the Faraday’s electric
ﬁeld −(1/cl)dΦ/dt, should be uniform along the loop be-
cause the momentum change on the unit volume ∆P ∝ js
[14]. This warrants the analogy with a conventional loop
used above.

on a ls segment. ω = Nsw/tlong is the average frequency
of a switching between the superconducting state with
diﬀerent connectivity; Nsw is the number of switching
for tlong. The amplitude of the oscillations ∆Vos ≤
0.25(π¯h/e)ω at ls = l/2. π¯h/e = 2.07 µV /GHz is
equal to the ratio of the voltage and the frequency in
the Josephson eﬀect [15]. Consequently, according to (2)
the oscillations Fig.4 with ∆V ≈ 1 µV can be observed
if ω ≥ 2 GHz.

The ∆Vos increases more slowly with the frequency
than (2) if ω > 1/τrel. Where τrel is any relaxation time
in stationary states, which can be equal the relaxation
time of superconducting ﬂuctuations τf l [11] or the de-
cay time of the screening current τR. 1/τf l ≈ 2 GHz in
order of value because τf l = π¯h/8kB(T − Tc) in the lin-
ear approximation region above Tc [11] and the width of
the critical region of our loops ∆Tr.t. ≈ 0.02K. 1/τR ≈
(2e2/m)nsρn ≈ eρnjsc/mvs ≈ 10 GHz in order of value.
Here the value |jsc| = |Isc|/s ≈ 2 107 A/m2 found above,
|vs| = π¯h/2ml ≈ 30 m/s for |n − Φ/Φ0| = 0.5 and the
ρn value of Al were used. Consequently, the voltage os-
cillations observed in our work Fig.3,4 can be induced
by a switching between the superconducting state with
diﬀerent connectivity.

This switching can be induced by both the thermal
ﬂuctuations and an external electric noise. A high-

4

frequency noise with Inoise ≥ sjc = (c2skBT /2πλ2ξ)1/2
increases the probability Psw of the switching in the nor-
mal state. Psw ∝ exp(−slsfsup/kBT ) at ls ≥ ξ, where
fsup = (2π/c2)λ2j2
c is the energy density of the transi-
tion in the normal state [11]; ξ is the superconducting
coherence length; λ is the London penetration depth.
For the loops used in our work (c2skBT /2πλ2ξ)1/2 ≈
(∆Tr.t./Tc)3/4 10−5 A ≈ 0.5 µA. We can not guarantee
that Inoise ≪ 0.5 µA. Moreover we observed an inﬂuence
of an external electric noise on the Vos value. Therefore
we can not state that the voltage oscillations observed in
our work at Im = 0 are induced in the equilibrium state
although the power W = VosIsc ≈ 2 10−13W t does not
exceed the limit value kBT /¯h ≈ 10−12 [3,14] which can
be induced by the thermal ﬂuctuations.

In conclusion, we have observed voltage oscillations
measured on segments of an inhomogeneous loop at zero
external direct current in the same region where the
Little-Parks oscillations are observed. This voltage can
be induced by both thermal ﬂuctuation and an external
electric noise.

We acknowledge useful discussions with V.A.Tulin.

Deriving the General Relativity Formalism:
Understanding its Successes and Failures

There are now at least eight experiments extending over more than 100
years that have detected the anisotropy of the speed of light, implying the
absolute motion of the detecting apparatus through a dynamical space.
There are also many experiments that because of design ﬂaws have failed
to detect that anisotropy. This light-speed anisotropy is consistent with
relativistic eﬀects and Lorentz symmetry, contrary to prevailing beliefs in
physics. The theoretical and experimental evidence implies that physics
has failed to realise the existence of a dynamical 3-space, and that mo-
tion relative to that space is the cause of various relativistic eﬀects, as
proposed by Lorentz in 1899. As well there is growing evidence that the
phenomenon of gravity is more complex than previously believed, that
Newtonian gravity appears to have failed even in the non-relativistic
regime. A new physics has emerged that builds upon this observed dy-
namical 3-space and provides a dynamical theory for that space. This
has resulted in a necessary generalisation of the Maxwell, Schr¨odinger
and Dirac equations, which then provide an explanation for gravity as
an emergent phenomenon within the new physics. From the generalised
Dirac equation we show that the spacetime formalism is derivable, but
as merely a mathematical construct whose geodesics arise from the tra-
jectories of quantum wavepackets in the 3-space. However the metric
of this spacetime is shown not to satisfy the Hilbert-Einstein equations,
except in the special case of the Schwarzschild metric. Hence we demon-
strate that the successes of the General Relativity formalism have been
more illusory than real, that its successes are in fact quite limited, which
explains why it failed to account for the bore hole anomaly, the so-called
‘dark matter’ spiral galaxy rotation anomaly, the systematics of black
hole masses and so on.
It also failed in that the dynamics of the 3-
space is determined by two fundamental constants, namely G and the
ﬁne structure constant α.

Introduction

We present here a derivation of General Relativity [1, 2]1, together with its geodesic
formalism, from a deeper theory in which the phenomenon of gravity emerges as
1There are ongoing developments regarding the priority issue of GR. However it is becoming clear
that GR is actually a ﬂawed theory of gravity, as discussed herein and elsewhere, which will put that
issue into a diﬀerent perspective.

a quantum matter eﬀect when coupled to a dynamical structured 3-space. This
derivation shows that both the ﬂat and curved spacetime formalism arise as a purely
mathematical construct - it has no ontological signiﬁcance. The experimental evidence
is that a dynamical 3-space has been repeatedly observed over more than 100 years,
and that physics has simply missed the existence of this 3-space [3-13].
It is then
necessary to generalise the Maxwell, Schr¨odinger and Dirac equations in order to
couple these wave phenomena to the 3-space [14, 15]. In the case of the Schr¨odinger
and Dirac equations we see that gravity arises as an emergent quantum phenomena,
while from the generalised Maxwell equations (as ﬁrst suggested by Hertz in 1890
[16]) we obtain the light bending eﬀects. The experimental data has shown that the
dynamics of the observed 3-space involves two fundamental constant G and α, the
ﬁne structure constant [15, 17, 18, 19, 20]. This discovery is surely indicating that a
new uniﬁed theory of reality is emerging. Although the curved spacetime manifold
formalism is shown to yield the correct matter and light trajectories, via the geodesic
formalism, the metric of the spacetime does not satisfy the Hilbert-Einstein equations
[1, 2] except in the special case of the Schwarzschild metric, and all but one of the
putative successes of General Relativity involved that metric. So the experimental,
observational and theoretical evidence is that the successes of General Relativity were
more illusory than real. It is also becoming clear that it is the Lorentz interpretation
[21] of relativistic eﬀects that is being conﬁrmed by experiment, namely that absolute
motion of quantum and EM phenomena through the 3-space causes the well known
relativistic eﬀects.

It is commonly assumed that the successes of the special relativity formalism
rest upon the assumption that the speed of light is the same for all observers, that
the speed of light is isotropic for any observer, and that any claims of an observed
anisotropy would be inconsistent with the successes of the special relativity formalism.
However this assumption is demonstrably wrong as discussed in [13, 22]. Of the
eight experiments that have independently and consistently detected that anisotropy
the most recent [13] has also detected gravitational waves, though not of the form
supposedly predicted from General Relativity.

2 Dynamics of Space

At a deeper level an information-theoretic approach to modelling reality, Process
Physics [22], leads to an emergent structured ‘space’ which is 3-dimensional and dy-
namic, but where the 3-dimensionality is only approximate, in that if we ignore non-
trivial topological aspects of the space, then it may be embedded in a 3-dimensional
geometrical manifold. Here the space is a real existent discrete but fractal network
of relationships or connectivities, but the embedding space is purely a mathematical
way of characterising the 3-dimensionality of the network. This is illustrated in Fig.1.
This is not an ether model; that notion involved a duality in that both the ether and
the space in which it was embedded were both real. Now the key point is that how we
embed the network in the embedding space is very arbitrary: we could equally well

2

Figure 1: This is an iconic graphical representation of
how a dynamical network has its inherent approximate 3-
dimensionality displayed by an embedding in a mathemat-
ical space such as an E3 or an S3. This space is not real;
it is purely a mathematical artifact. Nevertheless this em-
beddability helps determine the minimal dynamics for the
network, as in (1). At a deeper level the network is a
quantum foam system [22]. The dynamical space is not an
ether model, as the embedding space does not exist.

rotate the embedding or use an embedding that has the network translated or trans-
lating. These general requirements then dictate the minimal dynamics for the actual
network, at a phenomenological level. To see this we assume at a coarse grained level
that the dynamical patterns within the network may be described by a velocity ﬁeld
v(r, t), where r is the location of a small region in the network according to some
arbitrary embedding. For simplicity we assume here that the global topology of the
network is not signiﬁcant for the local dynamics, and so we embed in an E3, although
a generalisation to an embedding in S3 is straightforward. The minimal dynamics
then follows from the above by writing down the lowest-order zero-rank tensors, of
dimension 1/t2, that are invariant under translation and rotation, giving2

In Process Physics quantum matter are topological defects in the network, but
here it is suﬃcient to give a simple description in terms of an eﬀective density, but
which can also model the ‘dark energy’ eﬀect and electromagnetic energy eﬀects,
which will be discussed elsewhere. We see that there are only four possible terms,
and so we need at most three possible constants to describe the dynamics of space:
G, α and β. G will turn out to be Newton’s gravitational constant, and describes the
rate of non-conservative ﬂow of space into matter. To determine the values of α and
β we must, at this stage, turn to experimental data.

However most experimental data involving the dynamics of space is observed by
detecting the so-called gravitational acceleration of matter, although increasingly light
bending is giving new information. Now the acceleration a of the dynamical patterns
in space is given by the Euler or convective expression

2Note that then, on dimensional grounds, the spatial dynamics cannot involve the speed of light c,
except on the RHS where relativistic eﬀects come into play if the speed of matter relative to the local
space becomes large, see [22]. This has signiﬁcant implications for the nature and speed of so-called
‘gravitational’ waves.

and this appears in one of the terms in (1). As shown in [14] and discussed later
herein the acceleration g of quantum matter is identical to this acceleration, apart
from vorticity and relativistic eﬀects, and so the gravitational acceleration of matter
is also given by (2).

which is an eﬀective matter density that would be required to mimic the α-dependent
spatial self-interaction dynamics. Then (5) is the diﬀerential form for Newton’s law
of gravity but with an additional non-matter eﬀective matter density. This eﬀect
explains the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies, bore hole g anomalies, and
the systematics of galactic black hole massess. As shown elsewhere it also explains,
when used with the generalised Maxwell’s equations, the gravitational lensing of light
by this ‘dark matter’ eﬀect.

An intriguing aspect to the spatial dynamics is that it is non-local. Historically
this was ﬁrst noticed by Newton who called it action-at-a-distance. To see this we
can write (1) as an integro-diﬀerential equation

This shows a high degree of non-locality and non-linearity, and in particular that
the behaviour of both ρDM and ρ manifest at a distance irrespective of the dynamics
of the intervening space. This non-local behaviour is analogous to that in quantum
systems. The non-local dynamics associated with the α dynamics has been tested in
various situations, as discussed herein, and so its validity is well established. This
implies that the minimal spatial dynamics in (1) involves non-local connectivities.

We term the dynamics of space in (1) as a ‘ﬂowing space’. This term can cause
confusion because in normal language a ‘ﬂow’ implies movement of something relative
to a background space; but here there is no existent background space, only the
non-existent mathematical embedding space. So here the ‘ﬂow’ refers to internal
relative motion, that one parcel of space has a motion relative to a nearby parcel of
space. Hence the absolute velocities in (1) have no observable meaning; that despite
appearances it is only the relative velocities that have any dynamical signiﬁcance. Of
course it is this requirement that determined the form of (1), as implemented via the
embedding space technique.

The new space dynamics shows that non-local eﬀects are more general than just
subtle eﬀects in the quantum theory, for in the space dynamics this non-local dynamics
is responsible for the supermassive black holes in galaxies. This non-local dynamics
is responsible for two other eﬀects: (i) that the dynamics of space within an event
horizon, say enclosing a black hole in-ﬂow singularity, aﬀects the space outside of the
horizon, even though EM radiation and matter cannot propagate out through the
event horizon, as there the in-ﬂow speed exceeds the speed of light. So in this new
physics we have the escape of information from within the event horizon, and (ii)
that the universe overall is more highly connected than previously thought. This may
explain why the universe is more uniform than expected on the basis of interactions
limited by the speed of light, i.e we probably have a solution to the cosmological
horizon problem.

However there is an additional role for the embedding space, namely as a coordi-
nate system used by a set of cooperating observers. But again while this is useful for
their discourse it is not real; it is not part of reality.

3 Bore Holes and Black Holes

A major recent discovery [17, 18, 19, 20] has been that experimental data from the
bore hole g anomaly has revealed that α is the ﬁne structure constant, to within
experimental errors: α = e2/¯hc
1/137.04. This anomaly is that g does not decrease
as rapidly as predicted by Newtonian gravity or GR as we descend down a bore hole.
The dynamics in (1) and (2) gives the anomaly to be

≈

∆g = 2παGρd

(8)

where d is the depth and ρ is the density, being that of glacial ice in the case of
the Greenland Ice Shelf experiments, or that of rock in the Nevada test site ex-
periment. Clearly (8) permits the value of α to be determined from the data,

3) from the Nevada test site data [20].

5) from the Greenland Ice Shelf data and, independently,

Eqn.(1) has ‘black hole’ solutions. The generic term ‘black hole’ is used because
they have a compact closed event horizon where the in-ﬂow speed relative to the
horizon equals the speed of light, but in other respects they diﬀer from the putative
black holes of General Relativity4 - in particular their gravitational acceleration is
not inverse square law. The evidence is that it is these new ‘black holes’ from (1) that
have been detected. There are two categories: (i) an in-ﬂow singularity induced by
the ﬂow into a matter system, such as, herein, a spherical galaxy or globular cluster.
These black holes are termed minimal black holes, as their eﬀective mass is minimal,
(ii) primordial naked black holes which then attract matter. These result in spiral
galaxies, and the eﬀective mass of the black hole is larger than required merely by the
matter induced in-ﬂow. These are therefore termed non-minimal black holes. These
explain the rapid formation of structure in the early universe, as the gravitational
acceleration is approximately 1/r rather than 1/r2. This is the feature that also
explains the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies.

Consider the case where we have a spherically symmetric matter distribution at
rest, on average with respect to distant space, and that the in-ﬂow is time-independent
and radially symmetric. Then (1) can now be written in the form, with v′ = dv(r)/dr,

This result applies to any spherically symmetric matter distribution, and is the origin
of the α terms in (3) and (4).
It is thus responsible for the bore hole anomaly
expression in (8). This means that the bore hole anomaly is indicative of an in-ﬂow
singularity at the centre of the earth. This contributes some 0.4% of the eﬀective
mass of the earth, as deﬁned by Newtonian gravity. However in star systems this
minimal black hole eﬀect is more apparent, and we label MDM as MBH . So far black
holes in 19 spherical star systems have been detected and together their masses give
a best-ﬁt value of α

1/137.4 [15].

4 Spiral Galaxy Rotation Anomaly

The application of the spatial dynamics to spiral galaxies is discussed in [17, 18, 19,
20] where it is shown that a complete non-matter explanation of the spiral galaxy
rotation speed anomaly is given: there is no such stuﬀ as ‘dark matter’ - it is an
α determined spatial self-interaction eﬀect. Essentially even in the non-relativistic
regime the Newtonian theory of gravity, with its ‘universal’ Inverse Square Law, is
deeply ﬂawed. Consider the non-perturbative solution of (1), say for a galaxy with
a non-spherical matter distribution. Then numerical techniques are necessary, but
beyond a suﬃciently large distance the in-ﬂow will have spherical symmetry, and in
that region we may use the spherically symmetric form of (1). Then (9) has an exact
non-perturbative two-parameter class of analytic solutions

where K and R are arbitrary constants in the ρ = 0 region, but whose values are
determined by matching to the solution in the matter region. Here R characterises
the length scale of the non-perturbative part of this expression, and K depends on α
and G and details of the matter distribution. The galactic circular orbital velocities
of stars etc may be used to observe this in-ﬂow process in a spiral galaxy and from
(4) and (15) we obtain a replacement for the Newtonian ‘inverse square law’ ,

Because of the α dependent part this rotation-velocity curve falls oﬀ extremely slowly
with r, as is indeed observed for spiral galaxies. Of course it was the inability of the
Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity theories to explain these observations that led to
the notion of ‘dark matter’.

5 Generalising the Maxwell, Schr¨odinger and Dirac Equa-

tions

One of the putative key tests of the GR formalism was the gravitational bending of
light. This also immediately follows from the new space dynamics once we also gen-
eralise the Maxwell equations so that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are excitations
of the dynamical space. The dynamics of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds must then
have the form, in empty space,

which was ﬁrst suggested by Hertz in 1890 [16]. As easily determined the speed of
EM radiation is now c = 1/√µǫ with respect to the space, and in general not with
respect to the observer if the observer is moving through space, as experiment has
indicated again and again. In particular the in-ﬂow in (3) causes a refraction eﬀect
of light passing close to the sun, with the angle of deﬂection given by

δ = 2

v2
c2 =

4GM (1 + α

2 + ..)

c2d

(19)

where v is the in-ﬂow speed at distance d and d is the impact parameter, here the
10−6 radians is actually a
radius of the sun. Hence the observed deﬂection of 8.4
measure of the in-ﬂow speed at the sun’s surface, and that gives v = 615km/s. At
the earth distance the sun induced spatial in-ﬂow speed is 42km/s, and this has been
extracted from the 1925/26 gas-mode interferometer Miller data [4, 22]. These radial
in-ﬂows are to be vectorially summed to the galactic ﬂow of some 400km/s, but since
that ﬂow is much more uniform it does not aﬀect the light bending by the sun in-ﬂow
component. The vector superposition eﬀect for spatial ﬂows is only approximate, and
30km/s
is discussed in [22]. The solar system has a galactic velocity of some 400
in the direction RA=5.2hr, Dec=-670, as conﬁrmed in a new light-speed anisotropy
experiment [13]. Hence the deﬂection of light by the sun is a way of directly measuring
the spatial in-ﬂow speed at the sun’s surface, and has nothing to do with an actual

±

curved spacetime. These generalised Maxwell equations also predict gravitational
lensing produced by the large in-ﬂows associated with new ‘black holes’ in galaxies.
So again this eﬀect permits the direct observation of the these black hole eﬀects with
their non inverse-square-law accelerations.

Next consider the generalised Schr¨odinger equation [14]

As discussed in [14] this is uniquely deﬁned by the requirement that the wave function
be attached to the dynamical space, and not to the embedding space, and that H(t)
be hermitian. We can compute the acceleration of a localised wave packet according
to

v is the velocity of the wave packet relative to the local space, as
where vR = v0
v0 is the velocity relative to the embedding space. Apart from the vorticity term
which causes rotation of the wave packet5 we see, as promised, that this matter
acceleration is equal to that of the space itself, as in (2). This is the ﬁrst derivation
of the phenomenon of gravity from a deeper theory: gravity is a quantum eﬀect -
namely the refraction of quantum waves by the internal diﬀerential motion of the
substructure patterns to space itself. Note that the equivalence principle has now
been explained, as this ‘gravitational’ acceleration is independent of the mass m of
the quantum system.

An analogous generalisation of the Dirac equation is also necessary giving the
coupling of the spinor to the actual dynamical space, and again not to the embedding
space as has been the case up until now,

6 The Spacetime and Geodesic Formalism

The curved spacetime explanation for gravity is widely known. Here an explanation
for its putative success is given, for there is a natural deﬁnition of a spacetime that
arises from (1), but that it is purely a mathematical construction with no ontological
status - it is a mere mathematical artifact. We shall now show how this leads to both
the spacetime mathematical construct and that the geodesic for matter worldlines in
that spacetime is equivalent to trajectories from (24). First we note that (24) may
be obtained by extremising the time-dilated elapsed time

τ [r0] =

(25)

(26)

(27)

with respect to the particle trajectory r0(t) [22]. This happens because of the Fermat
least-time eﬀect for waves: only along the minimal time trajectory do the quantum
waves remain in phase under small variations of the path. This again emphasises that
gravity is a quantum eﬀect. We now introduce a spacetime mathematical construct
according to the metric

and the minimisation of (27) leads to the geodesics of the spacetime, which are thus
equivalent to the trajectories from (25), namely (24). Hence by coupling the Dirac
spinor dynamics to the space dynamics we derive the geodesic formalism of General
Relativity as a quantum eﬀect, but without reference to the Hilbert-Einstein equations
for the induced metric. Indeed in general the metric of this induced spacetime will not
satisfy these equations as the dynamical space involves the α-dependent dynamics,
and α is missing from GR. So why did GR appear to succeed in a number of key tests
where the Schwarzschild metric was used? The answer is provided by identifying the
induced spacetime metric corresponding to the in-ﬂow in (3) outside of a spherical
matter system, such as the earth. Then (26) becomes

which is one form of the the Schwarzschild metric but with the α-dynamics induced
eﬀective mass shift. Of course this is only valid outside of the spherical matter dis-
tribution, as that is the proviso also on (3). As well the above particular change
of coordinates also introduces spurious singularities at the event horizon7, but other
choices do not do this. Hence in the case of the Schwarzschild metric the dynamics
missing from both the Newtonian theory of gravity and General Relativity is merely
hidden in a mass redeﬁnition, and so didn’t aﬀect the various standard tests of GR,
or even of Newtonian gravity. Note that as well we see that the Schwarzschild metric
is none other than Newtonian gravity in disguise, except for the mass shift. While we
have now explained why the GR formalism appeared to work, it is also clear that this
formalism hides the manifest dynamics of the dynamical space, and which has also
been directly detected in gas-mode interferometer and coaxial-cable experiments.

7 Hilbert-Einstein Equations

Here we show that the metric of the spacetime manifold (26) emerging from (1) via
the generalised Dirac equation satisﬁes the Hilbert-Einstein GR [1, 2] equations, but
only in the limit α

0. The GR equations are

In vacuum, with Tµν = 0, we ﬁnd from (31) and (34) that Gµν = 0 implies that
Gµν = 0. We see the the Hilbert-Einstein equations demand that

but it is these terms in (1) that explain the various gravitational anomalies. This
simply corresponds to the fact that GR does not permit the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect
according to (6), and this happens because GR was forced to agree with Newtonian
gravity, in the appropriate limits, and that theory also has no such eﬀect. As well
in GR the energy-momentum tensor Tµν is not permitted to make any reference to
absolute linear motion of the matter; only the relative motion of matter or absolute
rotational motion is permitted, contrary to the experiments [3-13].

It is very signiﬁcant to note that the above exposition of the GR formalism for the
metric in (26) is exact. Then taking the trace of the
Gij equation in (35) we obtain,
also exactly, and in the case of zero vorticity, and outside of matter so that Tµν = 0,

which is the Newtonian ‘velocity ﬁeld’ formulation of Newtonian gravity outside of
matter, as in (1) but with α = β = 0.

8 Conclusions

The extensive non-null experimental evidence over more than 100 years for the
anisotropy of the one-way speed of light has ﬁnally been understood with the startling
conclusion that a dynamical structured 3-space exists and is responsible for the vari-
ous special relativity eﬀects and even Lorentz symmetry. As reviewed herein this has
lead to an explanation for the phenomenon of gravity, that it is a quantum matter
eﬀect arising from the refraction of the matter quantum waves in the dynamical 3-
space. In deriving the dynamical theory for this 3-space it has been discovered from
various experimental and observational data that its self-interaction coupling constant
in none other than the ﬁne structure constant α. From the generalised Dirac equation
we have shown that the quantum matter trajectories in the 3-space may be deter-
mined from the geodesics of a curved spacetime manifold, but that this spacetime

12

has no ontological status - it is purely a mathematical construct. We have also been
able to derive the Hilbert-Einstein General Relativity formalism, but that derivation
shows that it is only valid in the special limit of α
0. For the case of the external
Schwarzschild metric the α-dynamics amounts to a rescaling of the mass, and so had
no observational consequences - that is why the various tests of GR using that metric
appeared to be successful. Hence only by ﬁnally being able to explain gravity, and
by being able to derive the spacetime formalism, do we discover the reasons for its
successes and failures. One notable failure of the Hilbert-Einstein theory of gravity
was its inability to account for the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect. Not discussed here is
the explanation for the success of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and that the
dynamical equations for the 3-space have cosmological Hubble expansion solutions.

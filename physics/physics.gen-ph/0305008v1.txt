The mass and charge of a particle correspond to the most diverse form of
the same regularity of the nature of this ﬁeld. As a consequence, each of all
possible types of charges testiﬁes in favor of the existence of a kind of the
inertial mass. Therefore, to investigate these features we have established
the compound structures of mass and charge. They can explain also the
availability of fundamental diﬀerences in the masses as well as in the charges
of Dirac and Majorana neutrinos.

One of sharply expressed features of the interaction of Dirac (νD

= νD)
and Majorana (νM = νM ) neutrinos with ﬁeld of emission [1, 2, 3] is the con-
nection between these phenomena and character of the structure of fermions
[4, 5, 6, 7] themselves. At the same time a question about the nature, simi-
larity and diﬀerence of masses of neutrinos of both types [8] remains thus far
not ﬁnally investigated.

The nature is, according to well known considerations, created so that
all the forces in it be have the uniﬁed regularity. From this point of view,
becomes possible use the Newton law of gravity as the Coulomb law and vice
versa. In other words, these forces correspond to the most diverse form of
the same action. Exactly the same one can as the interacting objects choose
the two of neutrinos. Such a procedure, however, takes place regardless of
the neutrino structure of whether it is the Dirac or the Majorana fermion.
In this a hard connection is said between the inertial mass of a particle and
its physical nature.

Our study of elastic scattering of electrons and their neutrinos on a spinless
nucleus shows [9, 10] clearly that if the neutrino is the four - component
particle (ν = νD = νe) having a Dirac mass mνD, it must possess both normal
and anomalous electric charges. According to these data, the neutrino full
electric charge in the static limit has the size

eν =

3eGF m2

Such a picture leading to the ﬂip of the neutrino spin [11] and reﬂects the
fact that the mass and charge of a particle correspond to two form of the
same regularity of the nature of its structure [9, 10].

For further purposes of a given work it is desirable to remind about the
electron mass. From point of view of the classical theory of electromagnetic
mass [12], the availability of the eigenenergy E0 of the electron electrostatic
ﬁeld implies the existence of the electric part of the electron rest mass:

The assumption has even been speaked out that all the mass of the electron
is equal to its electromagnetic mass. This idea was simply called a hypothesis
of ﬁeld mass.

From our earlier developments, we ﬁnd that a particle mass is strictly
multicomponent. One of them corresponds to the electric charge and can be

called a Coulomb mass.
Insofar as the electrically neutral neutrino [13] is
concerned, its mass does not contain the part, at which it would have as well
as an electric charge.

The diﬀerence in the masses of Dirac (ν = νD) and Majorana (ν = νM )
neutrinos is observed because each of all possible types of charges of the same
neutrino arises as a consequence of the availability of a kind of the inertial
mass. Thereby this mechanism leads to the appearance of the united rest
mass mU
ν of the neutrino equal to all the mass of a given particle. Its general
structure at the account of nonweak [14, 15] and unknown properties of the
neutrino has the form

mU

ν = mE

ν + mW

ν + mS

ν + ...,

ν , mW

ν and mS

where mE
components of mass. Such a sight to the origination of mU
the presence of the united charge eU
a given fermion which contains the electric eE
other parts:

ν denote respectively the electric, weak and strong
ν quality explains
ν of the neutrino equal to all the charge of
ν and some

ν , strong eS

ν , weak eW

ν = eE
eU

ν + eW

ν + eS

ν + ....

So, it is seen that the mass and charge of a Dirac particle include in
self both electric and unelectric components. Of course, our formula (1)
characteize only a Coulomb mass dependence of the electric charge:

Using this and by following the fact that the force of Newton attraction
between the two neutrinos is less than the force of their Coulomb repulsion,
we ﬁnd that

It is clear, however, that the ﬁnding values of (4) and (5) are incompatible
with the available laboratory data [16]. At the same time this circumstance
may serve as some conﬁrmation of the availability of compound structures of
mass and charge.

Thus, it follows that if neutrinos are of electrically neutral (ν = νM ) then
νM = 0, eE

νM are reduced to the form

Comparing their with (2) and (3) at ν = νD, it is easy to observe the
fundamental diﬀerences in the masses as well as in the charges of neutrinos
of the diﬀerent nature.

νM = eW
eU

νM + ....

Of course, the above - noted regularities of general picture of massive
neutrinos extending well known hypothesis of ﬁeld mass meet with many
problems which require the study of the structure and property of each of
existing types of charges and masses.

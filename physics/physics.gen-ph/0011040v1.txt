Abstract

A review of the most recent results of the New Relativity Theory is presented. These include a straight-
forward derivation of the Black Hole Entropy-Area relation and its logarithmic corrections; the derivation of
the string uncertainty relations and generalizations ; ; the relation between the four dimensional gravitational
conformal anomaly and the ﬁne structure constant; the role of Noncommutative Geometry, Negative Prob-
abilities and Cantorian-Fractal spacetime in the Young’s two-slit experiment. We then generalize the recent
construction of the Quenched-Minisuperspace bosonic p-brane propagator in D dimensions (AACS [18] )
to the full multidimensional case involving all p-branes : the construction of the Multidimensional-Particle
propagator in Cliﬀord spaces ( C-spaces ) associated with a nested family of p-loop histories living in a target
D-dim background spacetime . We show how the eﬀective C-space geometry is related to extrinsic curvature
of ordinary spacetime. The motion of rigid particles/branes is studied to explain the natural emergence of
classical spin. The relation among C-space geometry and
, Finsler Geometry and ( Braided ) Quantum
Groups is discussed. Some ﬁnal remarks about the Riemannian long distance limit of C-space geometry are
made.

1. Introduction : The New Relativity Theory

Before we behin the present status and prsopects of the New Relativity Theory [1] we deem it very
important to review in 1 the New Extended Scale Relativity and its postulates. This is all one needs to con-
struct in 2 the generalization of the Quenched-Minisuperspace bosonic p-brane propagator in D dimensions
[18] ; i.e the Multidimensional-Particle propagator in C-spaces ( Cliﬀord ) associated with a nested family of
p-loop histories living in a D-dimensional target spacetime background. In 3 we discuss the derivation of the
Black Hole entropy and its logarithmic corrections directly from a p-loop Harmonic oscillator in C-space (
Cliﬀord space ). In 4 we review the derivation of the string uncertainty relations and corrections thereof
. ; In 5 we show how the eﬀective C-space geometry is
due to all p-brane values ranging from p = 0 to p =
∞
related to extrinsic curvature of ordinary spacetime. The motion of rigid particle/branes is studied in rela-
tion to the natural emergence of classical spin from C-space.Some ﬁnal remarks are made about the relation

the calculation of 4 + φ3 ( φ is the Golden Mean 0.618... ) as the average dimensions of the world is discussed
and the relation between the four dimensional gravitational conformal anomaly, Fractal Spacetime and the
ﬁne structure constant is explicitly shown. The role of Noncommutative Geometry, Negative Probabilities
and Cantorian-Fractal spacetime in the Young’s two-slit experiment of an indivisible quantum particle.
is
derived in 7 . In 8 we brieﬂy discuss Quantum Groups, and the Braided Hopf Quantum Cliﬀord Algebra
associated with the Master Action Functional for the quantum dynamics of the Master Field in C-space.
Finally, we present our conclusions. Some ﬁnal remarks about the Riemannian long distance limit of C-space
geometry are made.

Recently we have proposed that a New Relativity principle may be operating in Nature which could
reveal important clues to ﬁnd the origins of M theory [1]. We were forced to introduce this New Relativity
principle, where all dimensions and signatures of spacetime are on the same footing, to ﬁnd a fully covariant

1.1 Historical Background

formulation of the p-brane Quantum Mechanical Loop Wave equations. This New Relativity Principle, or
the principle of Polydimensional Covariance as has been called by Pezzaglia, has also been crucial in the
derivation of Papapetrou’s equations of motion of a spinning particle in curved spaces that was a long
standing problem which lasted almost 50 years [2]. A Cliﬀord calculus was used where all the equations
were written in terms of Cliﬀord-valued multivector quantities; i.e one had to abandon the use of vectors
and tensors and replace them by Cliﬀord-algebra valued quantities, matrices, for example .

The New Extended Scale Relativity Theory has already allow us to derive, from ﬁrst principles, the
String Uncertainty Relations, corrections thereof, and the precise connection between the Regge trajectory
behaviour of the string spectrum and the area quantization . The full blown inﬁnite-dimensional Quantum
Spacetime Generalized Uncertainty relations that included the contributions of all p-branes, not only due
In [4] we were able to show that there are no such things as EPR paradoxes
to strings, was given [3].
in this New Scale Relativity. The latter is truly a Machian Relativity theory, were relationships are the
only meaningful statements one can make. Originally it was formulated in an abstract Categorical space,
C-spaces [1]. The New Relativity sprang out from Laurent Nottale’s Scale Relativity [5]; Mohammed El
Naschie Transﬁnite Cantorian-Fractal Spacetime [6]; Garnet Ord’s original work on fractal random walks [7] ;
the classic Geoﬀrey Chew’s Bootstrap hypothesis : all p-branes are made of each other ( William Pezzaglia’s
principle of polydimensional covariance ); and p-adic Physics and Non-Archimedean Geometry by Siddarth,
Pitkannen, Khrennikov, Freund, Volovich, Vladimorov, Zelenov and many others [8].

The goals and partial list of sucesses of the New Relativity, formulated in Cantorian-Fractal Spacetime,

are :

theory.

1 - Hope to provide with a truly background independent formulation of Quantum Gravity and M

2- To furnish the physical foundations underlying String and M theory. So far nobody has been able
to answer the question : ” What is String Theory ? ”. The New Relativity may provide with a plausible
answer. In particular we were able to derive the string uncertainty relations directly from the wave equations
of the New Relativity [10] and its p-brane generalizations.

3- Prove why we live in 3 + 1 dimensions. In [9] we have shown that the average dimension of the world

is of the order of 4 + φ3.

4- Solve the cosmological constant problem [9] , in a similar fashion that Nottale did in his initial work
on Scale Relativity. And discuss of the existence of a dimensional phase transition from 4 + φ3 to φ3 , the
so called Noncommutative quasi-crystal phase.

5- Provide with a physical meaning to negative topological dimensions and to the notion of negative-

information entropy, or anti-entropy as has been called by M. Conrad. .

6- Write down the Unique Quantum Master Action functional of the world, in an abstract C-space,
outside spacetime, a generalized Twistor space, that governs the quantum dynamics for the creation of
spacetime itself; gravity and all of the other fundamental forces in Nature.

7- Propose a solution to how chiral symmetry-breaking occurs in Nature and much, much more [10].

With this preamble let us summarize brieﬂy what are the basic postulates of the New Relativity Theory
next. This will allow us to explain in full rigour why the fundamental constants in Nature, like Planck’s
constant, change with ” time ”; i.e. with the Renormalization Group ﬂow of the microscopic ( scaling ) arrow
of time: with energy or resolutions. We will explain why there is an eﬀective value of the Planck constant
when one approaches scales comparable with the Planck length : when quantum gravitational phenomena
are important.

1.2 The Postulates of the New Scale Relativity Theory

1 . Physics is an experimental science. Physics is about measurements. In order to perform a measure-
ment one needs a standard of measure to compare measurements with. In Einstein’s Relativity he introduced
the speed of light as the velocity standard to compare velocities with. From the mathematical point of view
one can say : let us have a ﬁeld at x. To deﬁne the real number x, mathematically, requires knowing its
value with inﬁnite precision : simply adding digits at will. To do it physically is another story. It would
require a computer an inﬁnite amount of memory just to store all this inﬁnite amount of information. One
way to avoid the problem of using real numbers is to introduce p-Adic numbes in Physics [8].

2

For these reasons, Laurent Nottale [5] introduced his original Scale Relativity by postulating that the
Planck scale is the universal standard of measurements. It is the minimum, impassible distance in Nature,
invariant under scale-relativistic dilatations. Exactly along similar lines, Einstein’s motion Relativity was
based on taking the speed of light as the maximum, and invariant, attainable speed in Nature. The Planck
scale in four dimensions is given in terms of the 3 fundamental constants, speed of light c , Newton’s constant
in four dimensions G and Planck’s constant ¯h :

Λ =

¯hG

c3 = 10−33cms.

r

(1)

(2a)

(2b)

Notice that if ¯h = 0, G = 0, c =

the Planck scale would have been automatically zero. Meaning
that one would not have ”quantum mechanics ” ; the gravitational force will reduce to 0 and there would
not be ” Lorentz invariance ”, only Galilean symmetry. The invariant minimum scale in all dimensions,
Λ will be set to unity; in units where ¯h = c = 1. The Planck scale is explictly dimension dependent
through its dependence on the Newton constants. So is the Newton gravitational constant. For example, in
D, D

2, .... , the Planck scale ( that we set to unity) is given in terms of the Newton constants :

1, D

∞

−

−

Λ = G(1/D−2)

D

= G(1/D−3)
D−1

= ...... = 1.

Taking logarithms ( in any base if one wishes ) on eq-(2a), one has the relationship among the Newton
1 diemnsions, which does not require any compactiﬁcations whatsoever, as it is
constants, in D and D
assumed in conventioanl string and Kaluza-Klein supergravities, :

Notice that when D = 2, the Newton constant in two-dimensions is set to G2 = 1 so that 1∞ = 1. For
example in D = 2, G2 = 1

ln G2 = ln 1 = 0 which is consistent with all the denominators of eq-(2b).

Variable speed of light Cosmologies are becoming very popular today. This does not imply that Einstein
was wrong at his time. This only means, as Dirac pointed out long ago, that the fundamental constants
can change slowly with ” time ” : the value of the constants slowly ﬂow with the Renormalization group,
from the Ultraviolet ( small scales ) to the Infrared ( large scales ). The speed of light when Einstein
formulated his theory is the same as today. Only during the early Universe there were substantial changes.
The constants ﬂow with the provision that the truly fundamental ” relativistic ” invariant in Nature, the
Planck scale, remains ﬁxed. Eq-(1) by inspection, entails that ¯h, c, G could ﬂow with the RG ﬂow in such
a fashion that they will leave Λ invariant. This explains how, at very large energies ( Planckian ) , at very
small scales ( Planck scales), we can begin to see the corrections to the fundamental constants. We have
now an understanding as to why one has an eﬀective Planck constant that can vary with energy once we
approach scales comparable to the Planck scale. Exactly the same thing happens when we approach the
speed of light : the masses begin to grow compared to their rest mass values.

2 . The Principle of Poly-dimensional covariance and the Cliﬀord-algebra-multivector calculus.
The New Relativity is a true Machian one. Relationships are the only meaningful statements one can
make. To view a single p-brane as an isolated entity is a meaningless concept. p-branes are solely deﬁned
in terms of others. For this reason, we included the Chew boostrap hypothesis as a crucial ingredient, and
wrote :

All p-branes are made of each-other. This is, in essence, the origins of the dualities in M theory.
Pezzaglia [2] using Chew’s bootstrap hypothesis coined the term ” poly-dimensional-covariance ”. Since
, the poly-dimensional covariance is
now we have all p-branes, of all dimensionalities from p = 0, 1, 2....
the statement that all p-branes ( dimensions ) rotate into each-other. Exactly what happens with ordinary
Lorentz transformations : the axis are entangled and space and time are mixed. For the role of objects
of negative topological dimensions see [10]. For example, in ordinary string theory, an object of dimension
1 + 1 = 0-dimensional ”worldline” : it is an instanton.
p =

−
Space and time have diﬀerent units. Einstein was able to connect them by the introduction of an
invariant velocity parameter : the speed of light. If one sets c = 1 in Einstein’s theory, space and time have
the same ” units ” : they are exchangeable. Since the Planck scale has units of length, upon setting Λ = 1,

1 spans a p + 1 =

∞

−

3

it means that all dimensions are are exchangeable also. Dimensions then can be ” rotated ” into each-other.
p-branes can be transformed into each-other ( duality principle ). Einstein’s Relativity required the use of a
Lorentz four-vector to embrace space with time; energy with momentum, etc.... In the New Relativity one
needs Cliﬀord-algebra-valued multivectors. The latter multi-vector is a mathematical object that encodes
all objects of diﬀerent dimensionalities. It encodes all p-brane histories, embedded in a target spacetime
background, into one single scoop. For the analog of ordinary Lorentz transformations that rotate space into
time, for example, one has polydimensional transformations, that rotate p-branes among each-other.

For this reason we will write our New Relativistic wave equations in a Cliﬀord-space, whose derivative
elements will be quadratic and have, in addition to the ordinary quadratic derivatives with respect to
ordinary point coordinates, xµ, quadratic derivatives w.r.t the holographic area-coordinates, holographic
volume-coordinates, ..... We will explain this in detail in section 2 what these holographic area, volume,
hypervolume....coordinates really are.

3 . Einstein’s General Relativity required a Riemannian Geometry; the New Relativity requires a
Cantorian-Fractal Spacetime model developed by Mohammed El Naschie [6]. The latter is an example of
Von Neuman’s PointlessNoncommutative Geometry. The world is multi-fractal. For a detailed analyis of
Noncommutative geometry, etc...see [10] and references therein.

Essentially one has that because the Planck scale is the minimum distance in Nature; there are no
such things as ” points ” in Nature. Only in Mathematics. A ” point ” is smeared into a fuzzy ball of all
possible topological dimensision. On average, the ” points ” are four-dimensional spheres, for this reason we
live eﬀectively in four-dimensions : we perceive an average dimension taken over all the inﬁnite-dimensional
spacetime [10]. This occurs exactly in the same fashion that we only measure the average velocity of an
ensemble of molecules in a room, when we measure the temperature of the room, pressure, etc...Cantorian-
Fractal Geometry is a ” pointless ” Noncommutative Geometry. As we zoom into what looks like a ” point”
from a distance, we realize that it is a four-dimensional sphere. As we zoom in deeper into what we thought
looked like a point inside that small sphere we realize that it is a smaller four-dimensional sphere; and so
forth ad inﬁnitum. We cannot reach the Planck scale. Like a massive object cannot reach the speed of light.
Nature is multifractal.

4 Non-Archimedean geometry and p-Adic Physics [8]
Since the Planck scale is the minimum attainable scale in Nature, Nottale provided with the scaling
analogs of Lorentz transformations : The composition of two scalings ( contractions ) cannot yield scales
smaller than the Planck scale.
In the same way that the addition of two velocities cannot exceed the
speed of light. This forces one to abandon the Archimedean Geometry for a Non-Archimedean one and the
replacement of real numbers for p-Adic ones [8]. Using a p-Adic norm, which allows to deﬁne p-adic numbers
based on another extension of the rational numbers , one can show that the net resulting p-adic norm, of
the composition/sum of two p-adic numbers, is less than the p-adic norm of the larger norm of the initial
two p-adic numbers. Roughly speaking, the p-adic norm obeys an ultra-metricity condition. p-Adics are the
natural numbers to use in the New Relativity. The latter Relativity is consitent with a Non-Archimedean
Geometry.

What we ﬁnd most important in using primes, the atoms of numbers, in the New Relativity is that all
prime numbers must appear on equal footing. In the same way that all dimensions did. Since dimensions
change this automatically entails that one must include also all topologies on equal footing : a “ Topological
Relativity” as has been called by Finkelstein and others. p-Adic numbers have been used to label topologies.
Not surprisingly, this ﬁts very well within this new framework. It is also well known to the experts that there
is a very deep connection between Quantum groups and p-Adic numbers when the deformation parameter
q = 1/p. The Real number limit p =
is equivalent to the classical group limit q = 0. Quantum Symmetric
spaces “ interpolate “ between the Real numbers and the p-Adic ones.

∞

To sum up, the world is not scale invariant. Dimensions are in the eye of the beholder [1,2]. They
are resolution-dependent [5,6]. As we probe into smaller regions, larger energies, with the ”microscope”
of the RG ﬂow, more dimensions are accesible to us. Things look diﬀerent to two observers living in two
diﬀerent scale-frames of references. The most famous example : it is meaningless to compare the vacuum
energies in two completely diﬀerent scale-frames of references : the Planck scale and the Hubble scale. This
is the fundamental reason why the ” cosmological” constant diﬀers by 60 orders of magnitude : the so-called
cosmological constant ” problem ”. This inconsistency, was elegantly solved by Nottale [5] and recently by

4

us [9] within the context of Renormalization Group techniques and self-organized non-equlibrium critical
phenomena in Cosmology, intially emphasized by Smolin and Kauﬀmann [19].

Based on this cursory introduction to the basic principles of the New Relativity, we can understand now
why the Planck constant ¯h, for example, is not a true constant, but it varies with energy, resolution. Once,
of course, we approach the Planck scale. At ordinary energies, ¯h is a constant. This is why these eﬀects
have not been detected in ordinary experiments. The energy is extremely low in comparison with the Planck
energy of 1019 GeV.

2. Quenched-Minisuperspace Bosonic p-brane Propagator and its C-space generalization

Recently AACS [18] we were able to write down the Quenched-Minisuperspace Bosonic p-brane prop-
agator by borrowing the Minisuperspace approximation from Cosmology, and the “ quenching “ procedure
from QCD. This new approximation provided an exact description of both the collective mode deformation
of the brane and the center of mass dynamics in the target spacetime. Earlier work based on loop spaces
allowed [30] to write down the Schwinger-Fock proper time formulation of wiggled p-branes.

Imagine one has a family of p-branes moving in a target spacetime background, where the values of
p range from p = 0, a point history; p = 1 a closed string history; p = 2 a closed membrane history. A
membrane of topology of a sphere, for example : a 2-loop; and so forth. Until one saturates the spacetime
with the spacetime ﬁlling p-brane : p + 1 = D. The family of p-brane degrees of freedom are encoded in
term of hyper-matrix coordinates [1]. .

Generalized ” hyper-matrix coordinates ” transformations in the New Relativity reshuﬄe, for example,
a loop history into a membrane history; a membrane history into a into a 5-brane history; a 5-brane history
into a 9-brane history and so forth; in particular it can transform a p-brane history into suitable combinations
of other p-brane histories as building blocks. This is the bootstrap idea taken from the point particle case
to to the p-branes case : each brane is made out of all the others. ” Lorentz” transformations in C-spaces
involve hypermatrix changes of ” coordinates ” [1] . The naive Lorentz transformations do not apply in
the world of Planck scale physics. Only at large scales the Riemannian continuum is recaptured . For a
discussion of the more fundamental Finsler Geometries implementing the minimum scale ( maximal proper
acceleration ) in String Theory see [13].

There was a one-to-one correspondence between the nested hierarchy of point, loop, 2-loop, 3-loop,......p-
loop histories encoded in terms of hypermatrices [1] and wave equations written in terms of Cliﬀord-algebra
valued multivector quantities.[2] This permitted us to recast the QM wave equations associated with the
hierarchy of nested p-loop histories, embedded in a target spacetime of D dimensions , where the values
1, as a single QM line functional wave equation whose lines live
of p range from : p = 0, 1, 2, 3......D
in a Noncommutative Cliﬀord manifold of 2D dimensions. p = D
1 is the the maximum value of p that
saturates the embedding spacetime dimension.

An action line functional, associated with the interacting QFT of lines in Noncommutative Cliﬀord
manifolds C-spaces, was launched forward in [1]. The QFT program of such interacting ﬁeld theory of C-lines
in Noncommutative spaces, a generalized Twistor theory, is currently under investigation [18]. One will have
cubic interactions associated with the product and coproduct of a Braided-Hopf-Quantum-Cliﬀord algebra
[15]. The product represents the annihilation of two C-lines into a third one. The coproduct represents the
creation of two lines from one line . The quartic interactions correspond to the braiding of two-lines into
another two-lines : scattering. One has here more complicated statistics than the ordinary bose/fermions
one : it is a braided one !. The two-point vertex corresponds to a pairing of the algebra representing the
composition of two lines into a 0-line. The kinetic terms are the extensions of Witten-Zwiebach open/closed
string ﬁeld theory, based on the Batalin-Vilkovisky Quantum Master action [16,17] . The closed-string ﬁeld
theory action required the used of Operads and Gerstenhaber algebras [17]. Such QFT in Noncommutative
spaces is a very complex one due to the Ultra-Violet/Infrared entanglement. Due to string duality, there is a
maximum scale dual to the minimum Planck scale. In [9] we provided with integral expressions to determine
the maximum scale that is dual to the Planck scale.

The multivector X encodes in one single stroke the point history represented by the ordinary xµ coor-
dinates and the holographic projections of the nested family of 1-loop, 2-loop, 3-loop...p-loop histories onto
the embedding coordinate spacetime planes given respectively by :

σµν , σµνρ......σµ1µ2...µp+1

The scalar Ωp+1 is the invariant proper p + 1 = D-volume associated with the motion of the ( maximal
dimension ) p-loop across the D = p + 1-dim target spacetime. It naturally couples to the unit matrix of
the Cliﬀord algebra.

There was a coincidence condition [1] that required to equate the values of the center of mass coordinates
xµ, for all the p -loops, with the values of the xµ coordinates of the point particle path history. This was
due to the fact that upon setting Λ = 0 all the p-loop histories collapse to a point history. The latter history
is the baseline where one constructs the whole hierarchy. This also required a proportionality relationship :

A C-line in C-space is nothing but a Cliﬀord algebraic extension of Penrose’s twistors. From a distance,
the line looks like a point history : a one-dimensional world line. Upon closer inspection, upon zooming in,
we realize that it corresponds to the center-of-mass motion of a closed string history, a 1-loop. And that
the line turns into a two-dimensional surface : the lateral area-swept by the closed-string. Upon a further
inspection, as we zoom in deeper, we realize that the closed-string history is really a closed-membrane history;
and so forth and so forth. Dimensions are resolution and energy dependent. All these p-brane histories that
have a common center-of-mass coordinate , are encoded in terms of the Cliﬀord-algebra-valued C-lines , a
generalized twistor. The holographic, or shadow-projections, of the areas, volumes, hypervolumes,....onto
the respective coordinate planes are nothing but the holographic coordinates of the C-lines.

The wave functional Ψ is in general a Cliﬀord-valued, hypercomplex number. In particular it could be
a complex, quaternionic or octonionic valued quantity. At the moment we shall not dwell on the very subtle
complications and battles associated with the quaternionic/octonionic extensions of Quantum Mechanics [14]
based on Division algebras and simply take the wave function to be a complex number. The line functional
wave equation for lines living in the Cliﬀord manifold ( C-spaces) are diﬃcult to solve in general. To obtain
the Bekenstein-Hawking Black-Hole Entropy-Area relations, and corrections thereof, one needs to simplify
them.

The most simple expression ( all modes are frozen except the zero modes ) is to write the simpliﬁed

wave equation for the family of free ( non-interacting ) p-loops in D-dimensions , in units ¯h = c = 1 :

One can notice the role of the quantities m ( mass ) and τ ( proper time ) in the expression for the kernel.
One can generalize this result to C-spaces by ﬁnding the analog of a C-space invariant; i.e a polydimensional
invariant parameter of dimensions of length λ cosntructed out of the two C-space invariants : The C-space
analog of proper time interval Σ given in eq-(4) and the analog of “ mass “ : the quantity mp+1 obeying the

These quantities are genuine invariants under automorphisms of the Cliﬀord algebra ; i.e polydimensional

will reshuf f le the components/dimensions in such a way that a membrane history rotates into a ﬁve-brane
history; a nine-brane rotates into an eleven-brane history and so forth, or even mixtures of all brane histories
. This is the p-brane Bootstrapping generalization of Chew’s particle bootstrap ideas extended to dimensions
: Pezzaglia’s polydimensional covariance principle.

Hence, these polydimesnional rotations are the extensions of ordinary Lorentz transformations leaving

the C-space interval invariant :

3 . Explicit Derivation of the Black Hole Entropy-Area Relations from the New Relativity Theory

Having gone through a brief tour of the the postulates of the New Relativity, we shall present in this
section the simple steps to derive the Black-Hole Entropy-Area linear relation and its logarithmic ( and
higher order ) corrections. leaving all the details to references [20,21]. We only need to discuss in detail the
generalized wave equations ( for the p-loop oscillator ) in a Cliﬀord-manifold that encode the dynamics such
family of p-brane or p-loop harmonic oscillators .

The most simple expression ( all modes are frozen except the zero modes ) is to write the simpliﬁed

wave equation for the p-loop harmonic oscillator , in units ¯h = c = 1 :

Hermite polynomials. The excitations of the p-loop oscillator are collective ones given by the set of center

the degree of the Cliﬀord algebra in D dimesnions ( “ number of bits “ ) is 2D. The f irst collective excited
state corresponds to setting all the quantum numbers equal to 1 in full compliance with the principle of
dimensional democracy ( p-brane democracy ) or poly-dimensional covariance : all dimensions must appear
on the same footing :

The degeneracy of the the

excited state the following Entropy :

Before invoking Shannon’s information entropy by setting the number of holographic p-loop bits to
2-dimensional area associated with a black hole horizon in d-
A/G , one needs

coincide precisely with the ratio of the d
dimensions ( d
to justify this assumption. Most importantly is to answer the following questions :

= D ) of radius R and the area of radius Λ in the following manner : N

∼

−

Where does Einstein’s gravity come from ? How is it obtained as the long distance eﬀective theory from
the ‘” gas “ of highly-excited p-loop oscillators quanta associated with New Relativty in C-spaces ( Cliﬀord
manifolds ) ?

•

At the moment we cannot answer such diﬃcult questions ; however we recall that the low energy
limit of string theory ( the eﬀective string action after integrating out the massive string modes ) reproduces
Einstein-Hilbert action with the ordinary scalar curvature term plus a series of higher powers of the curvature.
Einstein’s gravity is recovered as the low energy limit from strings propagating in curved backgrounds.

Fujikawa [23] has given strong reasons why Shannon’s Information Entropy is related to the Quantum

Statistical ( Thermodynamical) Entropy. In particular in understanding the meaning of Temperature.

•

•

Li and Yoneya [24] , among many others, have derived the Bekentein-Hawking entropy-area linear
relation by taking the logarithm of the degeneracy of the highly excited massive ( super ) string states in
d-dimensions.

•

The New Relativity principle advocates that dimensions are in the eye of the beholder [1,2] . In one
reference frame an observer sees a gas of p-loop oscillators in D-dimensions in the ﬁrst collective excited
state of N = 2D. In another frame of reference another observer sees only strings in d dimensions ( d
= D)
in a very highly excited state n.

If we identify Shannon’s information entropy as the number of bits N = 2D of the p-loop oscillator
which is just the degree of the Cliﬀord algebra in D dimensions , Shannon’s information entropy can them
be re-expressed in terms of the number of bits as follows :

N = SShannon = log2 (2N ) = N = 2D

N umber of states =

= 2N = 22D

.

(29)

⇒
Notice the double exponents deﬁning the number of states. The Black-Hole Horizon literarily is an
inf ormation horizon as well !

N

Now we are ready to make our only assumption. We will identify the number of p-loop bits N = 2D
in D dimensions to coincide precisely with the number of area bits contained by a Black-Hole horizon ( in
d dimensions ) of a given Area in units of the Planck scale. Namely it is the ratio of the areas of radius R
and Λ that gives the vlaue of the number of geometrical bits :

N = 2D =

Ad−2(R)
Ad−2(Λ) ∼

where we just wrote down the value of the Newton constant Gd in d-dimensions as Λd−2 . The number of
transverse dimensions to the radial r and temporal coordinates t of a spherically-symmetric black hole is
2)-dimensional one.

To conclude : We have obtained in a very straightforward fashion not only the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy-area linear relation for a Black Hole in any dimensions but also the logarithmic corrections plus

10

6

higher order corrections [ 21, 22 ] . All of these corrections appear with a minus sign and the entropy-area
relation satisﬁes the second law of black hole thermodynamics :

If two black holes of areas A1, A2 merge to give another black hole of area A3 > A1 + A2 then the resulting
entropy cannot decrease. For an upper bound on the values of A3 see [ 21 ]. In Planck units we obtained :

If A3 > A1 + A2 ⇒

S(A3)

S(A2) > 0.

.

For further details of all the technicalities behind this construction we refer to [21, 22 ] .

Perhaps the most salient feature is the intricate realtion between d, D, R, Λ in all these relations. Based
on the deﬁnition of number of geometrical bits as the ratio of two areas, one for radius R and the other for
radius Λ one can immediately infer :

N =

Ad−2(R)
Ad−2(Λ)

= 2D = (

)d−2.

Λ

Taking the logarithms on both sides we get the desired relationship among D, d, R, Λ :

This is a remarkable conclusion. When R = Λ , for D

→
2 ( dimensions where Cliﬀord algebras are
deﬁned) one recovers autmatically Nottale’s scale relativistic results that when one reaches the impassible
Planck scale the fractal dimension of spacetime blow up. We can see also why N cannot be equal to unity.
If N1 = N2 = 1 this violates the second law of black hole thermodynamics since 1 + 1 = 2 > 1.1. One must
have at least N = 2 in order that 2 + 2 = 4 = 2.2 and the relation (33) is not violated.

4. The Generalized Spacetime Uncertainty Relations

4.1. The String Uncertainty Relations follow from the New Relativity

We have studied the p-loop harmonic oscillator using the C-space wave equations. The free case admits

plane wave type solutions :

Inserting this plane wave type of solution into the wave equation fro the free p-loop case yields the generalized
dispersion relation :

Ψ = ei (kµxµ+kµν σµν +kµνρσµνρ+....).

This is just the extension of :

p2 = ¯h2k2.

p2 = m2.

On dimensional analysis and using the principle of polydimensional covariance one can infer that :

k2

kµkµ.

(kµν )(kµν ) = βk4.

(kµνρ)(kµνρ) = βk6......

where β is a proportionality coeﬃcient; i.e all dimensions are weighted by the same value in compliance with
polydimensional covariance.

Using this relation and inserting into the square root of the dispersion relation one obtaines an ef f ective

value of the Planck constant :

that the Planck scale ( resolution ) is unattainable in Nature. It takes an inf inite amount of energy to
resolve such scales ; i.e reaching inﬁnite dimensions in the process.

We would like to point out a common and widely spread misconception about the modiﬁed uncertainty

variables x′, p′ such as :

We deem very important to emphasize that the new momentum p′ of the ( noncanonical ) pair of
new variables x′, p′ ( the commmutator of x, p is not preserved ) must not be confused with the ef f ective
momentum pef f (p) given by (48) . Eqs-(48-51 ) indicate clearly that p′
= pef f ! Upon setting the Planck
momentum to be pP lanck = ¯h/Λ in eq-(52) one can see that in a sense one may compactif y the momentum
simply by having the momentum values bounded as : 0 < (p/pP lanck) < 2π. And this justiﬁes naturally the
introduction of an ultraviolet cuttoﬀ . Based on the Ultraviolet/Infrared entanglement in Noncommutative
Geometry one can also postulate an infared cuttoﬀ, in addition to an ultaviolet cuttoﬀ, consistent with
Nottale’s impassible upper length scale [5]. A sort of stringy T -duality analog. This idea allow us to
postulate a phase transition for the universe, from the metastable vacuum whose average dimension is close
to 4 + φ3, to the Noncommutative quasi-crystal phase of dual dimension φ3 = [1/(4 + φ3)] [9] . This phase
transition from the metastable vacuum to the ﬁnal quasi-crystal phase of average dimensions equal to φ3 is
completed once the size of the universe has reached the upper impassible dual scale to the Planck scale in
the fashion we shall indicate next. A rough estimate of such upper scale

To ﬁnalize this section we wish to add that we have arrived at similar results as Majid [12] : at scales
close to the Planck scale we do not have the standard Lorentz invariance but a Quantum Group deformation
as indicated by Majid and others [12]. We will discuss the role of quantum groups, Braided Hopf Quantum
Algebras, Braided QFT next in the construction of the Master Action Functional . Especially, the importance
it has in order to recover, in the long distance limit , ordinary Einstein-Riemannian Geometry from the more
fundamental C-space Geometry.

5 Rigid Branes, Spin, Extrinsic Curvature and the Eﬀective C-space Geometry

In this section we will provide with a geometrical meaning to the eﬀective momentum pef f appearing in
eq-(48). To the author, this is probably one of the most fascinating results from the New Relativity . It is the
emergence of an eﬀective background geometry linked to a spinning particle and the actions with an explicit
extrinsic curvature ( rigidity ) terms, directly from C-space. We shall argue why this eﬀective Geometry
Geometry is the geometry related
may in fact be connected to
to higher conformal spin theories, from spin 1 all the way to
. The subject of extended conformal ﬁeld
theories and

strings is very vast that we just refer to [34, 36] for references.

Pavsic [30] long ago has shown that the classical equations of motion for a rigid p-brane in a curved
background can be derived from a Lagrangian which contains extrinsic curvature terms . The world line for
a rigid point particle admits for equations of motion the Papapetrous’ s equations ( also studied by Pezzaglia
using Cliﬀord algebras ) for a spinning particle ( not a geodesic ) . Though our rigid particle is pointlike it

W

13

has eﬀectively spin due to the extrinsic curvature term in the action which forces the particle to move in
a helical path.

Pavsic was also able to show that the action for a rigid particle can be obtained via a “ Kaluza-Klein “
reduction of an open string wound up around a compact direction. The particle equations of motion follow
from the truncated string equations of motion. If the string is spacelike, and is compactiﬁed along a spacelike
direction, the derived rigid particle action has only tachyonic non-trivial solutions. This could be relevant to
the current tachyon condensation studies in M theory ( Sen and Ghoskal [8] ) and a plausible explanation of
the apparent superluminal group velocities found in the recent experiments. It is clear from the generalized
dispersion relation in C-space, given by eq-(37), that one may encounter eﬀective group velocities faster than
light. This is not surprising since after all we are working in C-space and not in the ordinary spacetime
of Special Relativity. If the string is timelike then the derived rigid particle has subluminal ( bradyonic)
non-trivial solutions corresponding to a helical ( or circular ) motion. This helical motion is precisely the
one associated with the values of the eﬀective pef f given by eq-(48), as we intend to show next.

Pavsic considered the action for rigid p branes in a target curved D spacetime:

(55a)

where γAB is the induced p-brane metric as a result of the embedding of the p-brane into spacetime. γ is
the determinant of γAB. T is the p-brane tension; µ is the rigidity parameter ( like a “ friction “ term that
opposes bending ) ; X µ(σA) are the embedding coordinates of the p-brane whose worldvolume coordinates
are σA with A = 1, 2, 3....p + 1 < D. H µ is a vector related to the extrinsic curvature :

AB = DADBX µ(σA) + Γµ

αβ ∂AX α(σA) ∂BX β(σA)

≡ DADBX µ(σA). H µ

≡

H µ

ABγAB.

(55b)

The Lagrangian is of second order and the equations of motion contain quartic derivatives when H µ
= 0.
When H µ = 0 the equations of motion coincide with the harmonic equations of motion associated with the
minimal embedding surface in a curved background : H µ =
DADBX µ = 0. In the special case of a rigid
particle the f ourth order equation associated with its worldline is nothing but Papapetrou’s equation for a

This has a straighforward explanation based on C-space geometry. The geodesic Cliﬀord-algebra valued
lines in C-space are not geodesics in ordinary spacetime ! Secondly, to diﬀerentiate with respect to τ is not
the same than to diﬀerentiate with respect to the Σp+1 ( which is the true C-space generalization of proper
time ). The eﬀective particle motion was shown to be helical and was due to the classical spin , “ induced”
by the extrinsic curvature terms. The classical spin or intrinsic angular momentum ( associated with the
second order action ) is given by :

The second order action of Pavsic, involving extrinsic curvature rigidity terms, contains for basic variables
X µ and (dX µ/dτ ) ( and their assocated ﬁrst and second order canonical momenta ) . This occurs also in
the more fundamental Finsler Geometries ( Jet Bundles ) where the metric is both a function of the position
and velocities. Finsler Geometries have both a maximum speed and maximum four acceleration ( maximum
value of tidal forces ). The maximum four acceleration is a = c2/Λ. If the Planck scale is seto to zero, Finsler
Geometry collapses to Riemannian one. Finsler Geometry [13] has natural connection to W geometry ( see

the references of C. Hull in [34]) . And the latter is related to the extrinsic geometry of embedded surfaces in
CP N spaces as Sotkov, and then Gervias and Matsuo have shown, [36] . The realtion to the Moyal-Fedosov
Deformation Quantization was shown by the author following the work of C. Hull , see [34].

All this has a natural interpretation in C-space ( Pezzaglia [2] has also discussed the relation between
spin, Cliﬀord algebras and polydimensional covariance ). One has an ordinary center of mass of motion
associated with the p-loop histories. The ﬁrst order corrections are the nothing but the area remnants of
the extended objects or p-loop holographic coordinates : The holographic area proyections σµν have for their
Fourier conjugates , the two-vector kµν .

By keeping only the leading term in the expansion , the eﬀective momentum ( 48 ) will have two pieces,
one from the center of mass motion, and another from the holographic components kµν . The latter are the
Fourier dual to the holographic Area coordinates σµν or Spin tensor/Spin-two-vector Sµν. The temporal
change of the holographic area σµν /Sµν is nothing but the kµν as we intend to show.

The eﬀective momentum due to the center of mass and spinning motion found in [30] was :

To make this connection more explicit with the eﬀective pef f found in eq-( 48 ) we need ﬁrstly to study
the special solutions which correspond to the case when H µ
= 0 but with H µHµ = 0 ( null-like acceleration );
i.e these solutions precisely correspond to the helical motion in ﬂat spacetime. Notice that in general ﬂatness
does not necessarily imply torsionless. Flat Superspace Supergravity has T orsion. The torsion is associated
to spin. The connection in superspace has the ordinary Levi-Civita piece but an extra piiece due to the
fermion bilinear terms ( torsion ) . In this special case the rigid point particle follows a helical world line
( as a result of the spin ) with center of mass momentum given by the translational motion along the axis
of the helix and the angular rotation frecuency is precisely related to the rigidity parameter ω2 = (m/2µ).
The vector H µ satisﬁed H µ = (d2X µ/dτ 2) ( an acceleration ) and it had a null norm H µHµ = 0. The rate
of change of the Spin two-vector ( Areal coordinates ) is :

Which clearly has the form of a two-vector momentum :

The rigid particle follows a helical world line in such a fashion [30] that the circular motion moves
along a null surface in such a way the the net spacetime interval spanned by its motion is precisely equal
to the spacetime interval spanned by the center-of-mass motion ( see [30] for details ). If one deﬁnes the
λh then the geometric mean
temporal-step interval parameter to complete one full revolution to be λhelix ≡
relation is clear. The temporal-step paameter, or period, to complete one full revolution is greater or equal
to the Compton wavelength of the particle ( in units pf c = 1). This immediately allows us to evaluate the
value of the rigidity parameter µ from the frecuency relation [30] :

The most important conclusion of this section is that a geodesic in C-space does not correspond to
a geodesic in ordinary spacetime. The ﬁrst leading corrections of the eﬀective C-space Geometry furnish
naturally the Papapetrou’s equations for a rigid particle .
; i.e a classical spin is induced by the extrinsic
curvature rigidity terms and, consequentlty, the worldline is a helical ( circular in some limiting case )
motion in ordinary spacetime; i.e the rigid particle does not follow a geodesic, the four acceleration is not
zero, although it has null norm . Roughly speaking, the free “multidimensional- particle “ in C-space, to
the ﬁrst leading approximation, corresponds to a spinning particle ( helical motion ).

We took the Planck scale Λ to be the natural length scale of this problem because of its relation to the
C-space geometry. There are also the two other natural length scales λh ( the helical motion period ) and
1/m ( the Compton wavelength ) and we were able to derive the geometric mean relationship among these 3
scales. The latter relation allowed us to estimate the value of the rigidity constant µ exactly in terms of m, Λ.
The Compton wavelength of the rigid particle falls in between the Planck scale and the λh scale ( period )
which emerged from the full C-space propagator. Pezzaglia [2] took another diﬀerent value for the natural
scale related to the properties of the electron. For interesting ideas pertaining the role of Grassmanian time
in QM see [39] and for superluminal travel through extra dimesnions see [40].

6. The Four Dimensional Conformal Anomaly, Fractal Spacetime and the Fine Structure Constant

In this section we will brieﬂy summarize the most relevant features of Fractal spacetime to cosmological
applications. In essence, the universe began as a process of non-equilibrium self-organized critical phenomena.
Following the spirit of Cantorian-Fractal spacetime [6] in [9] we computed the eﬀective ( time dependent )
average dimension of the world by taking the statistical average of an inﬁnity family of p-loops , of bubbles
. The gamma function was derived as the dimensional
whose dimension ranged from D =

The backbone set

dimension equals the Golden Mean φ. The backbone set is a random Cantor set whose dimension is φ <
ln(2)/ln(3) with probability one according to the celebrated Maudlin-Williams theorem. The transﬁnite
Cantorian-Fractal spacetime model of El Naschie is the randomly constructed geometric space that ﬁts very
naturally within the Random Process Physics ( Self Referential Noise as a model of reality ) program of
Cahill and Klinger [29] , based on Godel and Chaitin’s work , and consistent with the most recent work on
Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Algorithmic Random Processes in Nature [31] . In addition, it
adopts von Neumann’s Noncommutative Pointless Geometry at its very core.

The authors [32] more than two years ago computed the intrinsic Hausdorﬀ dimension of spacetime
at the inf rared ﬁxed point of the quantum conformal factor in 4D Gravity. The fractal dimension was
determined by the coeﬃcient Q2 of the Gauss-Bonnet topological term associated with the four dimensional
conformal anomaly ( trace anomaly ) and was computed to be greater than four. We were able to show
that one can relate the value of the Hausdorﬀ dimension computed by [32] to the universal dimensional
ﬂuctuation of spacetime given by φ3/2 = 0.11856... [38]. Based on the infared scaling limit and using
recent Renormalization group arguments by El Naschie [6] we conjectured that the unknown coeﬃcient Q2
associated with the four dimensional conformal anomaly may be equal to the inverse ﬁne structure constant
of values ranging from 137.036 to 137.641 [38] . The idea is based on Eddington’s old belief that the inverse
ﬁne structure constnat cod play the role of an internal ( electron’s dimension ).

The Hausdorﬀ dimension computed in terms of the conformal anomaly coeﬃcient Q2 by [32] was :

q

Inverting this relation allows one to express directly the anomaly coeﬃcient Q2 in terms of dH . By re-writing

Thus, if one sets 4 + ǫ to be 4 plus the universal dimensional ﬂuctuation ǫ = φ3/2 one obtains for the
anomaly coeﬃcient Q2 a value very close to the experimental value of 137.036. The value of 137.641.. will
be then associated with the inf rared contribution to the inverse ﬁne structure constant due to the quantum
ﬂuctuations of the conformal mode of the metric !

7. Noncommutative Geometry, Negative Probabilities and Cantorian Fractal Spacetime

Recently [38] we provided a straightforward explanation of the Young’s double-slit experiment of a QM
(∞) and Negative
particle based on the Noncommutative Geometric nature of the transﬁnite spacetime
probabilities. Since spacetime is in essence a randomly constructed space and the path of the QM parti-
cle is f ractal then any question about the exact spatial location of a microscopic point is fundamentally
undecidable due to the inherent uncertainty and fuzziness of the geometrical structure of such space [6]. Since
(∞) can in fact occupy two
von Neumann’s Noncommutative Geometry is a pointless one a “ point “ in
diﬀerent locations at the same time; i.e unions and intersections are indistinguishable. The same argument
follows from Pitkannen’s construction of p-Adic Fractals : there is a fundamentally indeterminism in these
(∞) is in fact a p-Adic topology : every point is the center of a disk becuase every
spaces. The Topology of
point can occupy many places at once.

The Young’s double-slit experiment admitted a straighforward interpretation by simply assigning to the
particle a fractal zig-zag motion around the two slits A, B : a Peano-Hilbert curve. The negative probability
came very natural due to the opposite orientations of the two Peano-Hilbert curves around slit A, B . The
probability was related to the inverse fractal dimesnions of the sets around slit A, B . The respective
probabilty assignments were respectively :

p(A) = φ.

histories could be given by a Braided QFT given by the action :

parametrized by the C-space extension of the “ proper time “ Σ as shown in eq-(4) .

As mentioned earlier, the ﬁrst term corresponds to the quadratic kinetic term. The second ones to the
analog of mass-squared terms for a scalar ﬁled theory ; the triple interaction vertex corresponds to both a
product ( two hyperlines join to give a third one ) and co-product ( one hyperline breaks into two ) of the
Quantum algebra. The quartic terms correspond to the braided scattering of the four lines. These are the
only terms allowed consitent with the Noncommutative Braided Hopf Quantum Cliﬀord algebra [15] encoded
by the star product

.

This star product is reminiscent of the Noncommutative star product associated with the BRST and
Batalin-Vilkoviski formulation of string ﬁeld theory [16, 17] where anticommuting variables are introduced.

Similar deformed star products have been obtained by Vasiliev in his construction of higher conformal
spin algebras from the deformation of the Anti de Sitter Algebra. These higher spin theories have been
essential to construct Higher Spin Supergravity Theories which are conjectured to be the eﬀective ﬁeld
theory limit of M Theory compactiﬁcations on S7

AdS4 [38].

This Braided QFT [33] is highly nontrivial. To derive the wave equations used for the p-loop harmonic
oscillator we had to make several assumptions. The ﬁrst one is to freeze or quench the higher order modes of
the functionals so one can approximate the dynamics by writing ordinary diﬀerential equations. Secondly
one must assume a f lat C-space metric. and thirdly we had to set the cubic and quartic couplings to zero .
See [20, 21]. In general one has a nonlinear oscillator which has far richer properties than the linear case.

Riemannian Geometry as the large distance limit of C-space Geometry

Mahid has proposed a Planck scale Hopf algebra, a sort of gravity/co-gravity dulaity : meaning a

curved phase space ( perfectly consistent with the Finsler and
group algebraic properties of a plausible Planck scale quantum geometry that should reproduce ordinary
classical Riemannian Geometry in the long distance limit.
In particular he derived the analogous ( not
identical ) commutations relations to our commutation relations eq-(41) :

where L is a suitable length scale. The quantum ﬂat space limit is attained when L = 0. The classical limit
is attained when ¯h = 0. The most interesting aspect of majid PLanck scale Hopf Algebra construction is
that one can simulate the dynamics of a particle with a position dependent momentum p′ given by :

p′ = po[1

e−x/L].

[x′, p′] = [x, po[1

In such a fashion that it mimics the motion of a free falling particle into a black hole whose velocity mesaured

) + O(¯h).

As the particle approaches the origin it apperas to move more slowly relative to the asymptotic observer and
will take an inﬁnite amount of time ( relative to the observer ) to reach the origin. This is excatly similar (
up to a factor of 1/2 ) to the formula for the radial infalling particle velocity in the vecinity of a Black Hole
of mass M and Schwarschild radius R :

v(r) = v∞(1

Another way to recapture the Riemannian ( Black Hole ) Geometry in the large distance limit x = r >>

show that :

Based on what we have shown in this work it seems undoubtledly that the New Relativity is marching

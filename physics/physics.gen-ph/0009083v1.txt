QUANTIZED FRACTAL SPACE TIME

AND STOCHASTIC HOLISM

Abstract

The space time that is used in relativistic Quantum Mechanics and
Quantum Field Theory is the Minkowski space time. Yet, as pointed
out by several scholars this classical space time is incompatible with
the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle: We cannot go down to arbi-
trarily small space time intervals, let alone space time points. Infact
this classical space time is at best an approximation, and this has
been criticised by several scholars. We investigate, what exactly this
approximation entails.

Over the past several decades, time has been studied by several scholars from
diﬀerent perspectives[1]-[30]. As pointed out in Chapter 3, Newtonian space
time was purely geometrical, as compared to Einstein’s physical study of it,
whether it be the Minkowski space time of Special Relativity or the Rieman-
nian space time of General Relativity. In almost all these studies, as also
in Quantum Field Theory, we still speak of space time points and deal with
rigid scales even though the Quantum Mechanical Uncertainty Principle con-
tradicts these notions as discussed in preceding Chapters like Chapters 2, 3
and 6.
In the preceding Chapters we have highlighted these shortcomings and have
referred to the concept of discrete space time. There is a nuance, though.
Discrete space time could still be thought of in the context of rigid minimum

units, for example the Planck length, or more generally the Compton wave-
length of the most massive elementary particle[31].
However, as highlighted in Chapter 6 we have considered the Compton wave-
length, ﬁrstly without restricting it to the most massive particle, and secondly
in the context of a stochastic underpinning: We were lead to Quantized Frac-
tal Space Time (QFST).
Using QFST, we then saw in Chapter 6 that

(~x, t) → (~x, t)γ

(1)

where the γ’s are matrices. However the constraints imposed by the commu-
tation relations

[y, z] = (ıa2/¯h)Lx,[t, y] = (ıa2/¯hc)My,

[x, py] = [y, px] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpy;

require the γ’s to be atleast, 4 × 4 Dirac matrices. At the same time these
commutation relations underlie the double connectivity or spin half, which
is closely connected with non-commutativity, as we saw (Cf. also ref.[32]).
From equation (1) it would appear that there are extra dimensions - indeed
we encountered this in the previous Chapter. As pointed out, the situation
is similar to that in Quantum Superstrings. These extra dimensions are
curled up or supressed, in the unphysical Compton region. In the Kaluza-
Klein theory, on the other hand, the curling up takes place within the Planck
length. Still, we could reconcile the two.
We also saw in Chapter 6 that the double Weiner process within the Compton
scale gives rise to Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and indeed
time itself, through the equation

x → x + ıx′ where x′ = ct

and the complex velocity potential V − ıU. (We also saw in Chapter 3 that
the so called non-relativistic Quantum Theory is not really Galilean invari-
ant, as a true non-relativistic theory should be. This is borne out by the
Sagnac eﬀect [33].)
On the other hand if there were no double Weiner process (or zitterbewe-
gung), then the diﬀusion constant ν would vanish and there would be nei-
ther Special Relativity nor Quantum Mechanics (nor time!). This would also

2

amount to the disappearance of the quantized vortices in the hydrodynami-
cal formulation seen in Chapter 3.
These situations expose the mismatch of the classical ideas of space time and
Quantum Theory.
Indeed as Wheeler put it [34], ”No prediction of space
time, therefore no meaning for space time is the verdict of the Quantum
Principle. That object which is central to all of Classical General Relativ-
ity, the four dimensional space time geometry, simply does not exist, except
in a Classical approximation.” Inspite of this, to understand the nature of
the non- Quantum Mechanical space time of Classical Theory, let us take
the diﬀusion constant of Chapter 6, ν(or the Planck constant h) to be very
small, but non-vanishing. That is we consider the semi classical case. This
is because, a purely classical description, does not provide any insight.
It is well known that in this situation we can use the WKB approximation[35].
In this case the right hand side of the equation

ψ = √ρeı/¯hS

goes over to, in the one dimensional case, for simplicity,

(px)−

1

2 e

ı

¯h R p(x)dx

so that we have, on comparison,

ρ =

1
px

(2)

In this case the condition U = 0 implies

ν · ∇ln(√ρ) = 0

(3)
(Cf. Chapter 6). This semi classical analysis suggests that √ρ is a slowly
varying function of x, infact each of the factors on the left side of (3) would be
∼ 0(h), so that the left side is ∼ 0(h2) (which is being neglected). Then from
(2) we conclude that px is independent of x, or is a slowly varying function
of x.
The equation of continuity now gives

∂ρ
∂t

+ ~∇(ρ~v) =

∂ρ
∂t

= 0

3

That is the probability density ρ is independent or nearly so, not only of
x, but also of t. We are thus in a stationary and homogenous scenario.
This is strictly speaking, possible only in a single particle universe, or for a
completely isolated particle, without any eﬀect of the environment. Under
these circumstances we have the various conservation laws and the time re-
versible theory, all this taken over into Quantum Mechanics as well. With
Wheeler’s turn of phrase, though with a slightly diﬀerent connotation, this
is ”time without time” or ”change without change”, an approximation valid
for small, incremental changes, as indeed is implicit in the concept of a dif-
ferentiable space time manifold. All this should not be surprising. In the
preceding Chapter, section 2, we have indeed noted the limitations of the
Field approach, a framework otherwise necessary for studying a multitude of
particles[36].
We noted in Chapter 2, Prigogine’s statement that ”Our physical world is no
longer symbolised by the stable and periodic planetary motions that are at
the heart of classical mechanics”. The moment we consider the simplest of
cases, viz., the three body problem, even in Newtonian Mechanics, it amounts
to bringing in instabilities due to the environmental or holistic feature.
In our considerations in the preceding Chapters, we encountered exactly this
holistic feature in a stochastic setting, what may be called stochastic holism.
For example this is embodied not only in the various Large Number relations
deduced in Chapter 7 or the ﬂuctuations underlying interactions in Chapter
8, but also in the fact that as we saw in the last Chapter, the number of par-
ticles in the universe (and a maximal universal velocity) can be considered to
be the only free parameter - the other microphysical constants are dependent
on this. If Classical Theory can be compared to a strucutre constructed with
rigid building blocks, with ideas like local realism thrown in[37], we are here
talking about a picture where the building blocks themselves depend on the
overall structure stochastically.
In this case the puzzle of the irreversibility of time, as discussed by several
scholars[38]-[46] also disappears. Irreversibility is a consequence of the sta-
tistical, or in a manner of speaking Thermodynamic nature of space time.
Indeed we saw in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 that the equation

T = √N τ

provides an immediate arrow of time, while in Chapter 10 we saw how QFST
could explain the Kaon decay.

4

It was shown in Chapter 7 that this picture of ﬂuctuations in the context
of QFST leads automatically to the Large Number Relations. Ofcourse it is
possible to trivialise these Large Number relations as coincidences with an
anthropic type argument [47]. Our approach on the other hand has been not
so much an explanation for cosmic numerology, as it has been a search for
minimum underlying simple principles, in the spirit of Occam’s razor, that
would explain disparate phenomena. That is what science is all about.

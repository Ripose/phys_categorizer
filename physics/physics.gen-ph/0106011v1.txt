Abstract

Four-dimensional mass is determined in four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean

space as a physical invariant of that space. That invariant is discussed as
an invariant of electromagnetic type. Finally, equations of Maxwell type are
obtained for mass ﬁelds.

In Okun’s publication ”What is mass?” [1] the formula

m2 =

U 2
c4

− P 2
c2

(1)

and comments on it looked very interesting to us for two reasons:
1) as a four-dimensional matter (in [1] it is deﬁned as ”simple mass”).
The analysis of non-stationar phenomena and processes lead V.A. Am-
bartsumian to the idea of a possible new state of matter. In works [2], [3]
and [4] the proto-star matter is discussed as a possible presentation of this
state.

There are also a few works by R. Muradyan ([5] and [6]) on unusual mani-
festations (quantum) of macroscopic star systems (two-dimensional hadron).
Publication [1] notes that during fragmentation four-dimensional mass
is not additive. The process of fragmentation continues to the point of oc-
currence of elementary particles (electron, proton) with emission of energy.
Later the usual three-dimensional matter is constructed from those particles,
which is the process of three-dimensionalization. The simplest form of this
matter is the hydrogen atom. The further cooling of the environment by
means of condensation, leads to the formation of usual star matter and its
systems, and these systems may be unstable. In that case the famous dis-
agreement between Ambartsumian and his opponents regarding the concept
of formation of star systems becomes unimportant. We would like to remind
that the ﬁrst member of expression (1) is a square of a scalar, and the second
member is a scalar - a module of square of a three-dimensional vector.

For compensation of the deﬁcit of the mean cosmic density of matter some
scientists proposed assumptions such as the ”spontaneous birth of matter”
(Hoyle), ”existence of galaxies of neutrino matter” (Novikov), or existence of
dark matter due to objects like the ”black holes”. Ambartsumian expressed
opinions regarding this in [3], [4] and during seminars where one of the au-
thors was present, that the law of energy conservation in its present form is
incomplete. With respect to that we assume that the invariant (1) is a scalar
of anti-symmetric tensor, which is created on the basis of three-dimensional
(polar and axial) vectors.

2) as Lorentz invariant of square form with anti-symmetric tensor of four-

dimensional matter [7].

Elements of this tensor can be considered as components of electric mass
(polar three-dimensional vector) and magnetic mass (axial three-dimensional
vector) ﬁelds.

With the help of this tensor we can construct invariant values with respect

to Lorentz modiﬁcations. These invariants have the following form:

MikM ik = I1, eiklmMikMlm = I2 or P 2 − U 2 = I1, UP = I2.

(3)

I1 corresponds to expression (1) and is discussed as Lagrangian of the
physical system and satisﬁes Lagrange equation which transforms into a
system of equations of Maxwell type. The four-dimensional form of these
equations is:

∂

∂xi M ik = jk, εiklm ∂

∂xk Mlm = 0

and in three-dimensional form it is

where ρ is the source (charge) of electric-mass static ﬁeld which has the
measurement of gr/cm and represents mass per unit length. And ﬁnally the
wave equation in four-dimensional form is (cid:3)A = 0 , where A is the vector-
potential of the electromagnetic-mass ﬁeld, and (cid:3) = − ∂2

∂xi∂xk .

The source of ﬁeld can be a mass string, as well as a mass ring. The
movement of mass along a string or a ring (any locked conﬁguration) induces
magnetic-mass ﬁeld of particular topology (toric, ﬂat, etc).

It might be very interesting to place this in electric or magnetic envi-
ronments, for instance inside an electric charge. A similar thing exists in
the work of Ciama [6] in which he gives up the advantage of general covari-
ance in favor of the vector theory of gravitation. The parameters of such
an object can be considered when a quantum (calibration) theory is created
similar to quantum electrodynamics or theory of electro-weak interactions.
It is not excluded that these ideas may be virtual and may not have anything
in common with real physics.

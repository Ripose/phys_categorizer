Abstract

The theory of Space rotations is introduced. The relativity principle is
generalized to satisfy to reference frames rotating in 3D space. It is shown
that the most postulates and limitations of quantum theories are conse-
quences of this extended relativity principle. The mathematical, physical
and philosophical aspects of the Space rotation theory are discussed.

Introduction

Can relativistic and quantum theories, these cornerstones of modern physics,
actually ﬁt together? May quantum physics become, following by M.Gell-Mann
[1], the real theory, but not “an anti-intuitive discipline ... full of mysteries and
paradoxes, that we do not completely understand, but are able to use ... limits,
in which, as we suppose, any correct theory should be included”?
In spite of all successes of both relativistic and quantum theories, there are big
“clouds on the horizon” [2] in their correlation. A lot of experiments have con-
ﬁrmed these theories separately, but it looks like their backgrounds contradict
to each other. For example, such eﬀects as “’wave function collapse”, EPR-like

1

eﬀects contradict to the second postulate of Einstein’s relativistic theory [3].
J.Butterﬁeld [2] “... admits that the physics community at large does not worry
so much about this cluster”. But the physics community had worried about it
so much before, from the beginning. A.Einstein could not believe in the valid-
ity of quantum mechanics [4] because of the EPR-like eﬀects. He has seen its
incompatibility to the basic relativistic principles, which were conﬁrmed exper-
imentally. But further experiments [5, 6, 7] also have conﬁrmed the quantum
mechanics conclusions. So, diﬀerent experiments contradict to diﬀerent theories,
or more correctly to say that the physical backgrounds of these theories contra-
dict to each other!
There is more fundamental contradiction. From the special relativity point of
view, the description of the quantum mechanical objects contradicts to the
causal principle – the basic one in natural science, the background of our world-
view. This is a very serious problem. It is not only physical, but philosophical,
worldview question and that is why the physical community prefers to keep
silence in this question, to keep all “as is”. The usual, “oﬃcial” way to solve
the problem in modern physics is do not solve it at all by declaring duality of
particles, postulating uncertainty relations etc. The excuse is that on this level
of investigation, the nature so diﬀers from our everyday views that we cannot
even imagine it. Do we know more than the ancient people explaining all events
in Nature by wills of their Gods?! I am sure, we need to search the answer, this
is a way of Science. The adepts of “oﬃcial” views transform very easily “can
not imaging” to “may not”. And this is quite dangerous, because science is
transformed to religion. Unfortunately, adepts of such views may be met at any
level of “the scientiﬁc hierarchy” in physics, even at very high. Such “religious”
scientiﬁc communities may be really dangerous for investigators of this ﬁeld of
science.
Realizing all problems and diﬃculties mentioned above, we are going to in-
troduce the Space rotation theory (SRT). It seems to us, that this theory can
overcome fundamental contradictions between the special relativity and quan-
tum mechanics. As far as the worldview questions are involved, we will introduce
the system of the Physical reality description (PhRD) from the SRT point of
view. After that, we will describe all involved to the PhRD components: the
SR frames of references; the physical objects (SR objects), which the SRT oper-
ates with; the physical laws and the space-time properties. We will analyze the
correspondence between the Space rotation theory with the special relativity,
quantum mechanics and, brieﬂy, with some modern theories.

1 Physical Reality Description

Notwithstanding the incompatibility of the theory of special relativity and quan-
tum mechanics, the possibility to coincide these theories, apparently, exists. It
is based on the generalization, adaptation of the idea of Relativity [3] onto
reference frames rotating in 3D-space. Such adaptation bases on the idea of
the equivalence of the SR frames. The equivalence is understood from point of
view of constructing the system of the Physical reality description. Indeed, it
concerns with not only the physical and mathematical questions, but also the
philosophical, worldview ones. From the ﬁrst view, it is well-known that physi-
cal laws are not invariant related to space rotations [8]. The problem, however,

may be brought to question: what really needs to be included into the system
of the physical reality description? It seems strange, but the revolution idea,
which lets overcome contradictions mentioned above, is the idea to include the
physical object by itself into this system. It means that in the physical Space
rotation theory the physical object “perception” may be changed in diﬀerent
SR frames. So, for example, the plane electromagnetic wave may be represented
in the “slow rotating” frame as a set of the spherical waves [9]. In general, as it
will be shown below, such a modiﬁcation of the object “perception” in diﬀerent
SR frames may be more considerable and has a qualitative character [10, 11].
The idea of Relativity introduced in special relativistic theory has changed our
imagination about space-time properties, has declared the equivalence of the in-
ertial reference frames from the point of an invariance of the physical laws in it.
The new type of physical objects was introduced in quantum mechanics, that
has caused the introducing of new postulates, new mathematical description,
in other words, new physical laws. These examples show us the interconnection
between PhRD components, so we can tell about the system of PhRD.
So, the components, we are going to include to the so-called “system of the
Physical reality description” are well known, but usually they were not used in
“system”. We will consider that PhRD consists of four interconnected compo-
nents: the physical laws, physical objects, frames of references and space-time
properties (see Fig. 1).
Unfortunately, there are no complete correspondence between quantum me-
chanical objects and laws with relativistic imagination of space-time properties.
These “clouds on the horizon” are principal. In introduced terminology we can
say that PhRD’s of special relativity and quantum mechanics do not correspond
to each other.
The special relativity idea of negation of the absolute reference frame leads to
its logical extension. Indeed, how to recognize the “initial” inertial frame (or
a system of inertial frames)? In other words: has the “inertiality” an absolute
character, and if yes, but why? The idea of relativity is “selfextracting”, so is
needed to be continued or limited. Such eﬀorts to extract the idea of relativity
to non-inertial frames (but not rotating ones) were made before. For example,
A.Logunov [12] generalized the Poincar´e’s relativity principle [13] in the form
of: “For any physical frame of references (inertial or non-inertial), it is always
possible to select the system of other frames, in which all physical processes are
going similar to the initial frame, so we do not have and it is impossible to have
any experimental possibilities to distinguish . . . what, exactly, frame from this
inﬁnite system we are in”.

3

The model of the local, material point (or the point mass) used for the physical
object description in classical theories meets also the conceptual problems [14].
We will also point to some additional problem on this way. We will call it the
scale problem. Usually, the continuous space-time is considered in the relativistic
theories. From the mathematical point of view, on this way, any local region in
space-time has the same power of set (by Cantor) as the whole space-time. It
is not clear, why do we have some scale of the observed physical world. Some
additional postulates need to be introduced to ﬁx the problem. One of the pos-
sibilities is the time or space discreteness. Partially, the SRT gives the answer to
this question by explaining the so called visual discreteness. It will be described
below in Sect.4.
From the introduced PhRD point of view, the PhRD of the quantum physics
is not complete, and not compatible with the relativistic one. There are big
problems in the relativistic PhRD too.

2 Space Rotation Frames

It was mentioned above in Sect.1 that the idea of relativity is “self extracting”, so
should be continued or limited. As far as we want to extend it to Space rotations,
we need to declare the Equivalence of the SR frames. So, we are introducing the
basic principle of the Space rotation theory – the principle of the Equivalence of
the rotating frames of references. The Equivalence is considered from the point
of view of creation of PhRD. The “mathematical” rotating frames are equivalent
to each other, but what does it mean from the physical point of view? We will
try to investigate this question here.

2.1 Types of Space Rotations

We will consider three types of “mathematical” 3D-space rotations: the axis
space rotation (ASR), the multiple space rotation (MSR) and the sum space
rotation (SSR).
We will call the space rotation (SR) of the K ′ frame of references related to K in
time t with the frequency ω about some ﬁxed space axis as an axis space rotation
(ASR). We will also use notations: τ = ct, Ω = ω/c, where c is a speed of light.
Space coordinates in K ′ will be marked by apostrophes as (x′, y′, z′) = X ′. The
coordinate transformation between the “initial” frame K and rotating one K ′
will be written as:

X ′ = X · (AASR

)±,

Here (AASR
)± is a transformation matrix of the ASR about z-axis in space
(without loosing the generality). At any time the functional determinant of the
ASR transformation matrix is equal to unit (det A = 1).
We will call the combination of ASR rotations with transformation matrices
A1, A2, . . . , An by deﬁnition as a multiple space rotation (MSR) and a sum
space rotation (SSR), if the general transformation matrices of these rotations

Let the K frame rotates related to K ′ with the transformation matrix A1 and
K ′′ frame rotates related to K ′ with the transformation matrix A2. The trans-
formation between K ′′ and K will be expressed by the transformation matrix
AMSR = {aij} = A1 · A2 =
kj. The SRs in SSR are considered from
the K frame of references.
It may be shown that some MSR and SSR properties in Table 2.1 are true. The
MSR transformations (and the ASR as a particular case) are forming the rota-
tion group like O(3), where t looks like parameter. Let’s denote this group as
an extended rotation group
O(3). Mathematically, MSR transforms one sphere
in K to another in K ′. In case of normalized MSR, for any t: kX ′k2 = kXk2.
The SSR transformations do not form a group. In distinguish to MSR, the SSR
transforms the sphere in K inside the full sphere in K ′. The value kX ′k2 is not
constant and depends on t.
Due to matrix properties, one can conclude that the transformation matrix of
any space rotation with at least one common rotation point may be represented
as a sum of products of the ASR transformation matrices:

The expression for the coordinate transformation without common rotation
point one can get by replacing space coordinates X by X + X0 on the cor-
responding step, where X0 is the origin coordinates displacement on this step.

2.2 Space Rotation Equivalence and Metrics

The ﬁrst of all, the SR frames Equivalence means that Minkowski space-time
can be built in any SR frame, so “internal” metrics can be introduced inside any
SR frame. For some space rotation with the transformation matrix A between
K and K ′ we will analyze the expression for “interval” in rotating frame K ′ in
the form:

ds′2 = c2dt2 − kdX ′k2,

(4)

5

where dX ′ is deﬁned as dX ′ = d(XA) = dXA + XdA and kdX ′k2 = dX ′dX ′T
(1). So, for (4) we will get:

(ds′

SR)2 = c2dt2 − XdAdAT X T − dXAAT dX T −

−

For the ASR and MSR this expression can be simpliﬁed:

• Metrics in rotation point.

The rotation point by deﬁnition is a common point of the axes of rotation,
included to the considered space rotation. If we consider the interval (4) from
rp = Xrp = (0, 0, 0) (the same in K and K ′), we will get
the rotation point X ′
for any time t (the transformation matrix is normalized):

k∆X ′k2 = X ′ · X ′T = X · AMSR(t)[AMSR(t)]T · X T = X · X T = k∆Xk2.

It means, according to (4), that K and K ′ are invariant in rotation point and
this invariance has a local (or even point) character. The situation with points
diﬀered from the rotation one is another.

• ASR metrics

Let’s consider the transformation matrix (AASR
generality. From (5), we will get the expression:

z

that in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) will be:

ASR)2 =

c2 − ω2ρ2

dt2 ± 2ρ2ω dφ dt − ρ2 dφ2 − dρ2 − dz2.

(8)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

In spite of our assumption (t = t′) in getting (4) is under question, this expres-
sion is completely the same as it is usually used in handbooks for the description
of metrics in such rotating frames (see, for example, Landau [15]). It is a good
sign on our way.
Physically, it is clear that on some distance from the rotation axis (ρ2 > c2/ω2),
the SR object in K ′ will have the speed in K more than the speed of light. It is
also impossible for the real physical object in our PhRD. So, if SR object exists
in K ′, it needs to be conﬁned inside some surface. This surface, deﬁned by the
equation ρ2 = c2/ω2 ↔ g00 = 0 (g00 is the metric tensor coeﬃcient at dt2),
divides the space into the internal and external regions correspondingly. This
surface looks like the horizon for real physical objects in K ′ from the K point of
view. We will call this surface as a horizon surface. The equation g00 = 0 with
diﬀerent frequencies ω deﬁnes a set of cylindroids about the z-axis (see Fig.2).

Figure 2: The ASR and MSR stable regions.

The metric tensor corresponding to the ASR interval has non-diagonal elements
and, so, SR frames are immeasurable. It means that we could not write an an-
alytical expression describing SR objects in rotating frames.

• MSR metrics

Let’s consider the MSR AMSR = AASR
(ω3), where ω1, ω2
and ω3 are rotation frequencies. For the MSR the analysis is diﬀered from the
ASR one, because the interval (6) depends on time and is complicated. For
example, for Aex = AASR

(ω), even kdX ′k2 will be expressed as:

(ω2) AASR

We will analyze the interval, averaged in time, from the point of view of the
observer in K and will consider that the period of time of the observation is
much longer than the period of any rotation included in the MSR. We consider
that such situation is quite close to the real situation in particle physics. We
will use the following expression for “averaging”:

On the analogy of the ASR analysis, we can conclude that there are some regions
localized in space, deﬁned by the equation g00 = 0, where the physical object
1Here t′ = t is assumed, because it is so in both SR frames at least at one point - the
rotation point. We may consider it as an interval seen in K ′ from the rotation point. It may
be considered as a ﬁrst order approximation to the real interval, but we believe that main
conclusions will be the same.

It is also possible to separate the space onto the internal and external parts and,
also, like in the MSR, the horizon of events surface has an ellipsoidal structure
(see Fig.2), but the “internal” space characteristics will diﬀer from the MSR
ones. We will discuss it later in Sect.3.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

3 Space Rotation Objects

It was mentioned in Sect.1 that “visual” characteristics of the SR objects may
diﬀer considerably from the “initial” characteristics of these objects in non-
rotating frame. Here we will try to ﬁnd the most general properties of the SR
object, which are deﬁned by the metrics of the SR frames.
The ﬁrst of all, the “visual” metrics structure (Fig.2) leads to the conclusion
that from the observer point of view any physical object in SR frame can not
escape from the internal region, because it is limited by the horizon surface.
This way it means that the SR object is localized in space and it is possible to
tell about “sizes” of SR objects. For MSR and SSR, these objects are localized
in 3D-space, and for ASR – in 2D-space. The conclusion about the existence
of the SR stable regions is an additional characteristic to the “mathematical”
O(3). Anyway, the
model, the “physical” aspect of the extended rotation group
existence of the stable objects is not a problem (as in modern physics), but a
direct consequence of the SRT.
The horizon surface is a very speciﬁc region. This way, a lot of characteristics
of the SR objects are hidden for the external observer. The question: Can we
get complete information about the SR objects? – Is open.

b

• ASR object.

For the ASR, the physical object in K ′ from K will be observed as an object,
localized in the internal region, stable on its edge and freely movable along with
the rotation axis. As far as the rotation frequency with the same value may have
two direction of rotation (may have positive or negative sign), it may be two
diﬀerent types of these objects. One can say that this object will have an addi-
tional characteristic from the K point of view. This characteristic looks like spin
that, on this approach, may be directed along or opposite the rotation axis. In
elementary particle physics, this behavior of the ASR physical object has some
correspondence with neutrino. Also, analyzing Eq.(8) one can ﬁnd that it needs

8

to be for the ASR object the correlation between transverse and longitudinal
motion: dz2/dt2 = c2 − ω2ρ2 − dρ2/dt2. Here dφ = 0, so as we consider the
rotation as a hidden parameter. It may be considered as neutrino oscillations.

• MSR object.

The MSR object is localized in 3D-space. As far as the “initial” SR object has
to have some energy in K ′ (it may be non-localized in K ′), the corresponding
object in K with some energy is localized for the observer. For him, we may
suppose, this object needs to have characteristics like rest mass of a particle,
because of well-known Einstein relation E = m0c2 (see Sect.4 in detail).
Comparing expression (10) with (7), (8), one can see that although the MSR
consists of a few orthogonal ASRs, the MSR object, localized in space, anyway
has some axis, picked out in space. Note, that it is some pseudo-axis, because
it is some “averaged in time” axis. We can suppose, as before, during the ASR
object analysis, that for the observer the MSR object also needs to have the
physical “spin”-characteristic. Here, it is not seen any limitations to the spin
direction related to the direction of the particle movement (in distinguish to the
ASR object). That also corresponds to the experimental data for the massive
particles with spin. Such MSR objects are similar to fermions.

• SSR object.

The SSR object is localized in space and, also, like the MSR object, has an
ellipsoidal structure (see Fig.2), but it is so only in “averaging” in time. It is
also possible to separate the space onto the internal and external parts, but
again, the “internal” characteristics will diﬀer from the MSR ones. The SSR
objects are localized in space and, apparently, are massive. But, generally, it is
impossible to pick out any space axis (even averaged) for the SSR object “as
a whole”. SSR objects may be “complex”, i.e. consisted of a few ASR or MSR
objects, but their characteristics “as a whole” diﬀer from the characteristics of
the included SR objects. For the SSR objects kX ′k2 6= kXk2 (with “averaging”
some additional coeﬃcients will appear). It looks like due to the SSR metrics
changing the intensity of the “interaction” between the included ASRs is in-
creasing, that, may be, will correspond to electroweak and strong forces. There
are arising the analogies with objects of chromodynamics (QCD). On this ap-
proach, if we will continue the analogies between SR objects and particles, it
is possible to ﬁnd some correspondence of the SSR objects with models of the
particles consisted of quarks (the SSR of ASR objects) and even with the nuclei
(the SSR of MSR objects). This way, for example, strange behavior of strong
interaction, the conﬁnement looks as logical consequence of SRT.
It is only qualitative correspondence between SR and quantum physics objects.
But, as it was mentioned before, due to SR frame properties, a lot of SR object
characteristics are hidden, because of SR frames are immeasurable and SR ob-
jects are inside the horizon surface. On this step, we do not even know how SR
objects may be observed from other SR frame. Now, we will try to investigate
these questions, to get more possible SR object characteristics to compare it
with the quantum physics models.

3.1 Quantiﬁcation

If the SR object in K ′ exists, it needs to be a source of some “inﬂuence” in K,
otherwise we would not know about it. We consider, that this “inﬂuence” is well
known in K (we don’t mean quantum physics here). Furthermore, this inﬂuence
cannot be an energy source in K or it has to be localized in space, diﬀerently,
the SR object would be a permanent power source or it would be unstable. This
localization conditions are connected with the energy conservation law in K.
We will analyze the stable and localized SR object. Let’s consider that it is a
source of some inﬂuence u(X, t) in K. The source function ρ(X, t), corresponding
to SR object, describing some its property, is deﬁned in some internal region
G in K and is equal to zero in external region. The wave-like inﬂuence u(X, t)
needs to satisfy the wave equation with the following fundamental solutions [16]
for one-, two- and three- dimensional space:

E1(X, t) =

Here v is a speed of the inﬂuence wave, δ is the Dirac delta function, θ is the

be equal to zero at any time, while it won’t be zero in the internal region.
The analysis of the establishing of the found steady-states of the SR object by
Eq.(13) shows (see Fig.3) that there exist objects spreading out the “nascent”
SR object with the speed of inﬂuence waves. These additional objects represent
the wave trains. The number of trains corresponds to the corresponded train
number of the steady-state object. So it is possible to tell about the “families”
or “classes” of the steady-state SR objects and corresponding moving objects.
In particle physics, analogies with the neutrino families are very transparent.

It follows from here, that with ka = −π/2 + πn for even and with ka = πn for
odd modes, where n is natural, the SR object inﬂuence in external regions will
be equal to zero at any time, while it won’t be zero in the internal region (Fig.4).
So, the localization conditions for 3D SR objects may be satisﬁed. We have found
that the SR objects satisfy to some quantiﬁcation conditions. Remarkable, that
the quantiﬁcation takes place without any external force ﬁeld.

• Electric charge

Let us consider the particular solution of Eq.(14) in 3D-space for P(r) = qδ(r −
a)/(4πa2). We consider that the inﬂuence is an electromagnetic wave. From
Expr.(16) with l = 0 one can get (SI):

U (r) =

q
4πǫ0a

sin[k(r − a)]
kr

,

(17)

where ǫ0 is a permittivity of vacuum. The corresponding distributions are shown
on Fig.4
This solution does not satisfy to the localization condition, it is deﬁned in a
whole 3D-space. The only way to overcome the contradiction with the energy
conservation law is to demand the wave frequency to be equal to zero. This way

12

there will not be an energy ﬂow from or to SR object. The limit of Eq.(17) with
k tends to zero is:

Here U (r) looks like a potential of particle with the charge q. The additional
constant q/(4πǫ0a) in the potential expression (18) usually does not play any
role in physics, but here it corresponds to the rest mass of a particle. Indeed:

m0 = E/c2 = qU (∞)/c2 = q2/(4πǫ0c2a) = µ0q2/(4πa).

This expression is exactly the relation between the electron rest mass m0 and
its classical radius a.
It looks strange, but the ﬁrst term in Expr.(18) corresponds to the electron
rest mass and the second one corresponds to its electrostatic potential. Is it
accidental or one of the basic properties? We will not comment it in this paper.

3.2 DeBroglie wave.

The SR object inﬂuence, taking into account the quantiﬁcation condition kn =
ωn/v, may be represented as:

u(X, t) =

U (ωn, X) exp(ıωnt).

This expression looks like Fourier expansion of the u(X, t). So, the following

Fourier expansion properties are valid for inﬂuence of the SR object:

means that the “internal” properties are neglected and are replacing with some
“macroparameters” (energy, momentum, rest mass etc.). Together with the ob-
served Fourier expansion properties, the Expr.(20) may have the probabilistic
interpretation.

4 Physical Laws

In previous Sections we have found some basic properties of the SR objects and
SR frames. It looks like the basic properties of the SR objects correspond to the
quantum mechanics ones, but the SR frames are immeasurable principally. Here
we will try to ﬁnd the possibility to describe the SR object and its behavior in
the observer frame.

13

4.1 Omega-invariance

Let’s consider the normalized MSR with the periodical rotation matrix AMSR =
A(t) = A(t+ 2πn/ω), where n is integer, and ﬁx two events (t1, X ′
1) and (t2, X ′
2)
in K ′. One can get by the SR deﬁnition:

∆X ′

|2πn/ω = X ′

2 − X ′

1 = X2A(t2) − X1A(t1) = ∆X · A|2πn/ω.

(21)

If the SR matrix is normalized (det A = 1), the distance between two space
points in K and K ′ is found to be equal to each other:

k∆X ′k2

|2πn/ω = k∆Xk2.

(22)

For any ﬁxed frequency ω, the time points t2 = t1 + 2πn/ω create the numerable
inﬁnite aggregate Λ : {t0 + 2πn/ω}∞
n=0 on the t-axis. The rotation frequency ω
is the initial parameter of this aggregation. On Λ the equality (22) is true,
and, consequently, the interval (4), as it was deﬁned in Minkowski space, is
invariant in K and K ′. We will call by deﬁnition that rotating frames K and
K ′ are Omega–invariant (or ω–invariant). It means that SR frames on this
inﬁnite aggregate look like Lorentz-invariant and so, we will consider, that they
are measurable on Λ. The frequency ω deﬁnes the scale between two frames of
references K and K ′. On this approach, this parameter seems and needs to be
very important in the physical object description in these frames.
Further, let’s a physical object (some of its property) is described in K ′ by
the function ψ′(X ′, τ ) and in K by function ψ(X, τ ). On Λ these functions are
measurable, because the interval (4), as it was deﬁned in Minkowski space, is
invariant in K and K ′, and one can write the condition expression, connecting
these functions:

ψ(X, τ )|2πn/ω =

l(X ′, τ )
ψ′

exp(±ımlΩτ )

,

(23)

Xl "

ml
Y

#

l ψ′

because for any natural l and interger ml, exp(±ımlΩτ )|2πn/ω = 1, where
ψ′(X ′, τ ) =
Furthermore, we will replace Λ by the real t-axis. It means that we are also
replacing the discrete set on X and X ′, so that X = X ′. Finally, we have got
the expression, connecting functions ψ in K and ψ′ in K ′ on Λ:

l(X ′, τ ), and in these points X ′

|2πn/ω = X.

ψ(X, τ ) =

At any, even very high values of ω, this approximation may be quite accurate,
but always not complete.
Following these assumptions, we can conclude that the introduced extended
O(3) group due to ω–invariance hypothesis transforms to the usual O(3) group
and also the Minkowski space metrics is valid for this object. This is already
enough to get the basic quantum mechanics equations such as Klein-Gordon-
b
Fock, Schr¨odinger and Dirac in the fashion standard in quantum theory [8].
The SR theory can explain a lot of diﬃculties and postulates of the quantum
theory. We will illustrate it by obtaining the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation for a
scalar particle without spin in the “SR theory fashion style”.

14

4.2 KGF equation

For simplicity, we will analyze the case l, ml = 1 of Expr.(24):

ψ(X, τ ) = ψ′(X, τ ) exp(±ıΩτ ).

(25)

Here we have got the expression (25), we have already used in Sect.3 for source
function (Eq.(14)). So, it has a meaning of the SR function transformation.
Remind, that on Λ: X = X ′ and we can consider ∇X = ∇X ′. So, the Lorentz
invariant second order diﬀerential operator, called the d’Alembertian operator,
will be invariant in frames K and K ′:

(cid:13) =

∂2
∂τ 2 − ∇2

X =

∂2
∂τ 2 − ∇2

X ′ = (cid:13)′.

We are able to apply the d’Alembertian operator to both parts of the Eq.(25).
It will lead to equation:

(cid:13)ψ(X, τ )
ψ(X, τ )

=

(cid:13)′ψ′(X ′, τ )
ψ′(X ′, τ )

− Ω2 +

2ıΩ
ψ′(X ′, τ )

∂ψ′(X ′, τ )
∂τ

.

(26)

The third term right may be neglected in comparison with the second one in
case of the stable particle, stable, at least, in comparison with the period of
rotation T = 2π/ω: Ω ≫ |(∂ψ′/∂τ )/ψ′|. If the physical object in K ′ (it may be,
for example, an electromagnetic wave) is satisﬁed the equation (cid:13)′ψ′(X, τ ) =
0, then supposing Ω = mc/¯h, one can get from (26) the Klein-Gordon-Fock
equation:

(cid:13)ψ
ψ

+

m2c2
¯h2 = 0.

(27)

The equation (27) is valid for any inertial to K frames of references due to the
Lorentz invariance of the d’Alembertian operator, that was directly shown in
[11]. There was also shown the obtaining of the Schr¨odinger equation in these
papers, which is the non-relativistic approximation to the Klein-Gordon equa-
tion. As far as the ω–invariance gives the necessary symmetries, it is possible to
obtain the Dirac equation by the usual way [8]. Note, that (22) is not satisﬁed
for SSR, so equations, created for SSR, apparently, will correspond to the QCD,
QFT equations.
From the SR point of view, the equation (27) contains a new idea – an idea of
connecting the physical object properties in diﬀerent rotating frames of refer-
ences. It is a consequence of the declared SR equivalence principle.
We may conclude, that on numerable inﬁnite aggregate Λ (discrete set), SR ob-
jects are both Lorentz- and Omega- invariant. So they looks like the quantum
physics objects and also satisfy to special relativity. This principally coincide
with the conclusion of V.Petkov [17], about the work of A.Anastasov [18] of
the possible “structure” of the quantum mechanics objects to correspond to the
special relativity. Now we can see why.

•The “Einstein’s formula” for the SR

The invariant E2/c2 − ~p · ~p = m2c2 given by the energy-momentum 4-vector of a
particle pµ = (E/c, ~p) in quantum mechanics corresponds to the KGF equation.
An electromagnetic wave in K ′ gives for this invariant E′2/c2 − ~p′ · ~p′ = 0. For

15

the stable and localized object in K (~p = ~0) this invariant will be E2/c2 = m2
so from (26) we can get the well-known Einstein’s formula:

0c2,

E2 = C(Ω)c2 = m2

0(Ω)c4.

(28)

Note that the “inﬂuence” of the SR object (Sect.3) may be interpreted as an
additional mass to (28), but it has another origin. Here we can see some corre-
spondence of the rotation frequency and the rest mass. This question needs to
be analyzed in details, but not in this paper (see also conclusions in Sect.5).

5 Space-Time Properties

The equivalence principle of the Space rotation theory leads to some new and
interesting aspects of our understanding of Space-time and its properties.

• Mathematically, any SR, considered in this paper, at any ﬁxed time t
(time is only a parameter of this transformation), transfers the R3 space
into itself. In special relativity time and space form a speciﬁc space-time
as a whole, with own metrics and properties. That’s why the uniform
transformation in mathematics leads to some paradoxes in physics. We
have seen above, that the “physical space” of K ′ consists of the internal,
visible space and external, invisible one from the K point of view. So,
visible space of K ′ is included to the visible space of K. Because of the SR
equivalence, considering K from the K ′ point of view, one may conclude,
that the visible space of K is included to the visible space of K ′. This is a
physical paradox that may be considered as a new type of the space-time
topology.

• The considered SR intervals corresponds to the metric tensor with non-
diagonal elements (even averaged in time), so, generally, the rotating
frames are immeasurable. The introduced Omega–invariance hypothesis
lets make them measurable, but, of course, with some limitations. These
limitations are in a good agreement with the quantum physics postulates
and paradoxes, that gives us some conﬁdence on our way. We keep in mind
that these limitations are coming from the SR theory; they are not postu-
lated or introduced. We may suppose, that “new” interactions, declared
in quantum physics, such as strong or electroweak, are reﬂections of the
“usual” forces, existing in rotating frames, to the observer frame. This is
a way to the Uniﬁcation theory of these forces.

• The correspondence of the SR object properties and quantum physics ones
gives us another conﬁdence of the legitimacy of the SR theory. For exam-
ple, the quantiﬁcation, spin etc. are essential parts of this theory, we do
not need to declare something new, to introduce these object properties.
As far as SR object is conﬁned inside a very speciﬁc region – the hori-
zon surface, some SR object characteristics, like spin for example, look
like real “internal”, “hidden” parameters. It corresponds to real situation.
Also, the SR object types, we can imagine, are in a good agreement with
known quantum physics objects. The quantiﬁcation conditions correspond

16

to the energy conservation law in the observer’s frame. It is also object
stability conditions. This way, such unstable elementary particles as reso-
nancies may be interpreted as the SR objects, for which the quantiﬁcation
conditions could not be satisﬁed in time period, deﬁned by ω–invariance.

At last, we would like to consider some philosophical consequences of the Space
rotation theory and its basic principle – the space rotation equivalence. After
declaring this principle, one can ask a lot of questions, such as: are where an
inﬁnite set of “parallel” “rotating worlds”, and, if there are, so why do not we
observe them in the everyday life and, is it possible, for example, to get to “an-
other world” by rotating in centrifuge etc.

• Rotating World.

The observer is connected with some PhRD, so he is connected with all included
components. If we consider a real man, as an observer, he is a part of the PhRD
and consists of the physical objects, existing in this PhRD. On the other hand,
the observer creates the PhRD, it is his product, as a child builds his own world
after his birth. He builds his own “projection” of the real World. In another SR
frame, it will be another physical objects, so the observer in one SR frame does
not exist in other one as a physical object. But it does not mean that there are
no any other “observers” in another SR frames. So, the question of existence
of the “parallel rotating worlds” is open. It may be that our visible Universe
is only one projection of the real Universe to our physical reality description
system (Platon has said something similar long time ago).

• Physical vacuum.

Another possibility is that our Universe is a result of a spontaneous symmetry
breakdown (in “macro-scale”) of the real Universe, so this symmetry is observ-
able only in “micro-scale”, the scale of the elementary particles, vacuum etc.
The diﬀerence between particles and vacuum is that physical vacuum is unreal-
ized particles in observer’s SR frame. In other words, vacuum looks like unstable
particles that cannot be identiﬁed as stable SR objects. Such representation also
coincides with modern understanding of the physical vacuum as a lot of virtual
particles.

We can observe the “consistence” of other rotating frames only in frames of
ω–invariance, so all our experiments will give principally incomplete information.

Conclusions and Remarks

It seems that our attempt to create the system of the physical reality description
applying to space rotations, undertaken in this paper, was successful enough and
we may declare the result as a Space rotation theory. The SR theory is based on
the SR equivalence, the quantiﬁcation principle and the ω–invariance hypothe-
sis.
The SR equivalence principle is a generalization of the Relativity principle by
the extension it to the space rotation frames. It includes the special relativity
principle as a particular case of the Equivalence principle. Also, the Equivalence
principle extends the conception of the space symmetry of the O(3) space ro-
O(3) adds some very important
tation groups. This extended rotation group

17

b

physical characteristics to space-time and SR object descriptions. The stable-
state objects, correlated with known quantum physics objects, are found.
The quantiﬁcation principle is based on the usual energy conservation law for
found SR objects. It does not need any additional postulates to explain the
quantum properties of existing particles and ﬁelds.
The ω–invariance hypothesis makes SR frames measurable, but, of course, with
some limitations. These limitations are coming from the SR theory; they are
not postulated or introduced. They are in a good agreement with the quantum
physics postulates and paradoxes.
From the SRT point of view, quantum physics is an eﬀort of the approximate
description of the immeasurable SR systems, because in quantum physics the
numerable inﬁnite aggregate on t-axis is replaced by the continuous t-axis. At
any, even very high values of ω, this approximation may be quite accurate, but
always not complete. It looks like the reason of the uncertainties in quantum
physics, its incompleteness and formalism [19]. We may suppose, that “new”
interactions, declared in quantum physics, such as strong or electroweak, are
reﬂections of the “usual” forces, existing in rotating frames, to the observer’s
frame and also “inﬂuence” of the SR objects in our frame. This is a way to the
Uniﬁcation of these forces.
All these facts make us declare the “initial”, basic origin of the SR theory in
comparison with the quantum physics. Also, on other hand, the invariance of
the special relativity looks like a particular case of the space rotation Equiva-
lence, the basic principle of SRT. So, SRT includes both special relativity and
quantum physics basic principles, really let them ﬁt together!
We have not considered the general relativity in this paper, because it is not
completely clear to us, what does gravitation mean from the SRT point of view.
But we believe that some correspondences mentioned above of rotation frequen-
cies, potentials with the rest mass give us a way to further investigations of this
question.

Introduction

It is understood for years now that there is a holographic duality between

= 4
supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory and IIB superstring theory compactiﬁed in a
stable de Sitter background [1]-[3]. This duality has been explored in many works; as
far as the correlation functions are concerned primarily only the three-point functions
and four-point functions in the supergravity side have been computed due to the
diﬃculty in obtaining non-perturbative four-point functions. The microscopic
=
4 supersymmetric gauge theory is to possess a non-perturbative S-duality that is
compatible with the corresponding one in IIB superstring theory. The latter is not
manifest in the direct quantization of the classical Lagrangian.

N

N

In this note it is commented on how to complete the fundamental Lagrangian
in the quantum regime in order to restore S-duality. For several reasons, plus the
form and coeﬃcients of the tree amplitudes, a completion of the
= 4 scattering
is required. The S-dual compliant scattering should be used in the AdS/CFT corre-
spondence. Typically, only the perturbative form of the gauge theory is used, without
the (p,q) dyons in tests of the correspondence.

The full amplitudes of

coupling perturbative series, i.e. the usual diagrammatic expansion formulated via
unitarity methods, or as an expansion in derivatives, with the latter approach being
nonperturbative in coupling. Both expansions are equivalent, found from a diagram

The sewing relations that allow for a determination of the coeﬃcients of the
modular functions at the various derivative orders is not reviewed. This is discussed
in detail in [4]-[10].

In [14] the derivative expansion in IIB superstring theory was formulated also in
terms of the appropriate modular invariant forms. Due to a conjecture of Green [15]
the linear combinations of these forms was delimited, to all orders in [15]-[16].
In
simple number theory terms, this conjecture was further established and shown to
follow from the partitions of the deformed free boson,

The simplicity of the partitions of (15) does appear to suggest the correctness of
the modular form ansatz. Also, the partitions suggest an aﬃne symmetry of the
scattering.

IIB Scattering and Number Theoretic Description

the zeta functions in the (4-pt) tree amplitude,

The Laplacian takes the form, when restricted to the perturbative sector, that is,
without the τ1 dependence,

∆ = 4τ 2

2 δτ δ¯τ .

The condition on A and B could in principle be determined generically by the tree
and one-loop contributions of the usual perturbative string amplitude; however, their
numbers are left unknown for the moment.

There have been several proposals for the quantum completion of the S-matrix,
and higher derivative terms up to genus two have been computed. The modular
invariant completion due to S-duality enforces certain structures on the coupling de-
pendence. A basis for the coupling structure is formed from the Eisenstein functions,
the contribution of which have recently been elucidated more completely in [15].

The polynomial system generating the perturbative contributions can be deter-
mined from a graphical illustration and also through a ’vertex’ algebra. The latter
can be found from expanding the function,

The latter is associated to a vertex algebra. The former will be shown to correspond
to the perturbative four-point function, without the non-analytic terms required by
unitarity.

There are a set of trees as depicted in ﬁgure 1. Each tree is found by taking a
number N, an odd number, and partitioning it into odd numbers 3, 5, 7, . . .. At each
pair of nodes the numbers in the partition are attached. The partition is labeled by
the set N(

The nodes of the trees are chosen, one from each pair, and a set of lines could be

drawn between these nodes. For each tree there are

ways of partitioning the tree into the same number of ’up’ and ’down’ nodes. Each tree

2k, the tree system is found by partitioning
starting at k = 0. At a speciﬁc order
the number N = 2k + 3. The number of partitions a number N can have into odd
numbers, excluding unity, is denoted Podd(N). The perturbative contributions to this
derivative order are found as follows,

1) attach weights to the nodes of the tree

2) take the product of the weights of the nodes in the tree

3) add the sums of the products

The sum of the products reintroduces the contribution of the modular ansatz to the
four-point scattering.

For reference, the genus truncation property holds at gmax = 1

2(2k + 2)
for k = n/2 with n either odd or even. There are Podd(2k + 3) partitions of 2k + 3
into odd numbers excluding unity, with a maximum number. The genus truncation
follows from the fact that there a maximum number of nodes in the tree.

Some examples of the partitions of numbers at a given derivative order

2kR4
are described in the following table. For example, at k = 4, the number 11 can be
partitioned into 11 and 3 + 3 + 5, with counts of 21 and 23.

k = 0

One would like to represent the terms group theoretically with the quantum numbers

The perturbative contribution to the order

associating the weights to the nodes. For the ’up’ node there is a factor

Each perturbative contribution is found by multiplying the node contributions. There
are the various weighted trees that contribute to the perturbative contribution at
2k + 3, when partitioned into the various odd numbers. Each contribution has the
weighted factor of B in the product. (The weighted trees resemble a fermionic system
with gmax fermions with a quantum level degeneracy non-identical fermions.) The
partitioning of the number 2k + 3 into the weighted trees is a convenient way of
describing all of the contributions to the particular derivative term.

Analog Number Theoretic Description to IIB

In this section a similar conjecture for the modular forms, with the appropriate
number theoretic interpretation, is generated for the
= 4 supersymmetric theory.
The ansatz deﬁnes speciﬁcally the linear combination of modular forms entering into
the modular ansatz.

N

Recall that a speciﬁc term in the derivative expansion is paramterized by the

combinations

Esi(τ, ¯τ )

si = s = n/2 .

(26)

X
The modular ansatz, as presented in the IIB superstring delimits the speciﬁc linear
combination.

Y

A conjecture for the

= 4 supersymmetric gauge theory is that the modular
kRm (with R
kF m term, is exactly the same as the
function entering into the
the Ricci curvature). For example, the F 4 term maps to the R4 term, with the E3/2
function as a prefactor. The correspondence holds for n-point scattering amplitudes.

N

Although, as in the IIB superstring scattering, this conjecture can in not proven

in this work, the maximal supersymmetry suggests this. The partition

generates the four-point gauge boson scattering amplitude. The integrability of the
gauge theory and the type IIB superstring has the same origin.

Due to the microscopic theory, S-duality will only be present in the correlation
functions if the (p,q) dyonic states appear in the eﬀective action (and scattering).
A scattering amplitude built from the perturbative gauge theory, and instantons,
will not by S-duality compliant. The most direct way to see this is that the tree

amplitudes in the S-duality compliant scattering (i.e. the tree contributions to
must contain factors of the zeta function. The modular construction predicts these
zeta factors appearing after expanding the Eisenstein series. The perturbative gauge
theory with instantons cannot produce these zeta values; rather the (p,q) dyonic
states must be included. (It appears unnatural to multiply the Eisenstein series by
additional zeta functions, because the loop contributions would contain odd ratios of
zeta functions).

The modular invariant scattering between the IIB superstring and the

= 4
gauge theory is naturally described in the S-duality context with the conjectured

N

= 4 scattering in this work.

N

It should be noted that one purpose of the conjectured holography is to compute
non-perturbative terms in the gauge theory from supergravity and string theory.
kF m
The conjectured S-duality compliant scattering in the gauge theory, with the
kRm, is a more direct way to obtain the nonperturbative gauge
mapping to the
theory scattering.

Although the gauge and string theory scattering is only a conjecture, there is ev-
idence for its correctness in the presence of the dyonic states, the modular invariance,
maximal supersymmetry, and the partition function indicating integrability.

Conclusion

A conjecture for the modular invariant scattering in the

= 4 supersymmetric
gauge theory has been produced. This is for each operator in the supersymmetric
action, and to all orders in the coupling, including the instantons. The conjecture is
similar to the recent papers describing the supersymmetric action of the IIB super-
string, which is also reviewed. The integrability is obvious in these constructions, both
= 4 gauge theory, although further diagrammatic
in the IIB superstring and the
work is required to rigourously prove the constructions.

N

N

The modular invariance of the scattering is required to make the correlation
functions of composite operators in the gauge theory S-dual compliant. This latter
property is required both for the quantum action of the gauge theory and for the
anti-de Sitter holographic correspondence with the IIB superstring. Typically this
modular invariance is not invoked in the holographic duality due in part because the
non-perturbative correlation functions havent been computed.

It would be interesting to ﬁnd constructions analogous to those presented here

for theories with lower amounts of supersymmetries.

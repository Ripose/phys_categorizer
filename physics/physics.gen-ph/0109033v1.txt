Abstract

Some elements of classical mechanics and classical statistical mechan-
ics are formulated in terms of ﬁbre bundles. In the bundle approach the
dynamical and distribution functions are replaced by liftings of paths in a
suitably chosen bundle. Their time evolution is described by appropriate
linear transports along paths in it or, equivalently, by corresponding invari-
ant bundle equations of motion.
In particular, the bundle version of the
Liouville equation is derived.

Introduction

In the series of papers [1–5], we have reformulated nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics in terms of ﬁbre bundles. In the present work, we want to try to
apply some ideas and methods from these papers to classical mechanics and
classical statistical mechanics. However, as a whole this is scarcely possible
because these theories are more or less primary related to the theory of
space (space-time) which is taken as a base of the corresponding bundle(s)
in the bundle approach and, consequently, it has to be determined by other
theory. By this reason, the ﬁbre bundle formalism is only partially applicable
to some elements of classical mechanics and classical statistical mechanics.
A diﬀerent geometrical approach to the statistical mechanics, based on

the projective geometry, can be found in [6].

The organization of this paper is the following. In Sect. 2 are recalled
some facts of classical Hamiltonian mechanics and ﬁx our notation.
In
Sect. 3, we give a ﬁbre bundle description of (explicitly time-independent)
dynamical functions, representing the observables in classical mechanics. In
this approach they are represented by liftings of paths in a suitably chosen
bundle. We show that their time evolution is governed by a kind of linear
(possibly parallel) transport along paths in this bundle or, equivalently, via
the corresponding bundle equation of motion derived here. Sect. 4 is devoted
to the bundle (analogue of the) Liouville equation, the equation on which
classical statistical mechanics rests. In the bundle description, we replace
the distribution function by a lifting of paths in the same bundle appearing
in Sect. 3. In it we derive the bundle version of the Liouville equation which
turns to be the equation for (linear) transportation of this lifting with re-
spect to a suitable linear transport along paths. The paper closes with some
remarks in Sect. 5.

2. Hamilton description of classical mechanics

(review)

In classical mechanics [7] the state of a dynamical system is accepted to be
describe via its generalized coordinates q = (q1, . . . , qN ) ∈ RN and momenta
p = (p1, . . . , pN ) ∈ RN with N ∈ N being the number of system’s degree
of freedom. The quantities characterizing a dynamical system, the so called
dynamical functions or variables, are described by C 1 functions in RF =
{f : F → R} with F being the system’s phase space. The Poisson bracket of
f, g ∈ RF is [7, § 8.4]

[f, g]P :=

N

which is an element of RF . The subset of RF consisting of C 1 functions and
endowed with the operations addition, multiplication (with real numbers)
and forming of Poisson brackets is called dynamical algebra and will be
denoted by D [8, Section 1.2]. The set D is closed with respect to the
mentioned operations and is a special kind of Lie algebra, the Poisson bracket
playing the rˆole of Lie bracket.

If h(q, p; t) is the system’s Hamiltonian, the system evolves in time t ∈ R

according to the (canonical) Hamilton equations [7, chapter 7, § 8.5]

˙qi =

∂h(q, p; t)
∂pi

=

qi, h

(cid:2)

P ,

(cid:3)

˙pi = −

∂h(q, p; t)
∂qi

= [pi, h]P ,

(2.2)

where i = 1, . . . , N and the dot means full derivative with respect to time,
˙qi := dqi/dt. The system’s state is completely known for every instant
e.g.
t if for some t0 ∈ R are ﬁxed the initial values (q, p)|t=t0 = (q0, p0) ∈ F with
F = R2N being system’s phase space.

If g is depending on time dynamical function, g ∈ RF×R, then its full

time derivative is [7, equation (8.58)]

To any dynamical function f ∈ D there corresponds operator [f]P : g 7→

[g, f]P g ∈ D, i.e.

Putting ξ := (q, p) = (q1, . . . , qN , p1, . . . , pN ) ∈ F and deﬁning the map
h : F → F by h : (q, p) 7→ ([h]P q1, . . . , [h]P qN , [h]P p1, . . . , [h]P pN ), which
map can be called Hamiltonian operator, we see that (2.2) is equivalent to

3. Bundle description of dynamical functions

in classical mechanics

At ﬁrst sight, it seems the solution of (2.5) might be written as ξ(t) =
U(t, t0)ξ(t0) with U(t, t0) being the Green’s function for this equation. How-
ever, this is wrong as generally h depends on ξ, h = h(ξ; t), so U itself must
depend on ξ. Consequently, we cannot apply to the Hamiltonian equa-
tion (2.5) the developed in [1] method for ﬁbre bundle interpretation and
reformulation of Schr¨odinger equation. The basic reason for this is that
the Hamilton equation is primary related to the (phase) space while the
Schr¨odinger one is closely related to the ‘space of observables’. This sug-
gests the idea of bundle description of dynamical functions which are the

Bozhidar Z. Iliev: On bundle classical and statistical mechanics

classical analogue of quantum observables. Below we brieﬂy realize it for
time-independent dynamical functions.

Let g ∈ D and ∂g/∂t = 0. By (2.3) and (2.4), we have

Writing for brevity g(t) instead of g(ξ(t); t) = g(ξ(t); t0), we can put

dg/dt = [h]P g.

g(t) = V(t, t0)g(t0),

where t0 is a ﬁxed instant of time and the dynamical operator V, the Green
function of (3.1), is deﬁned via the initial-value problem

∂V(t, t0)
∂t

= [h]P V(t, t0),

V(t0, t0) = 1.

(3.3)

(Here 1 is the corresponding unit operator.)

The explicit form of V(t, t0) is

V(t, t0) = 

V(t3, t1) = V(t3, t2)V(t2, t1),
V(t1, t1) = 1,

V −1(t1, t2) = V(t2, t1),

the last of which is a consequence of the preceding two. Here t1, t2 and t3
are any three moments of time.

Let M and T be the classical Newtonian respectively 3-dimensional space
and 1-dimensional time of classical mechanics.1 Let γ : J → M , J ⊆ T, be
the trajectory of some (point-like) observer (if the observer exists for all
t ∈ T, then J = T.)

Now deﬁne a bundle (R, πR, M ) with a total space R, base M , projection
πR : R → M , and isomorphic ﬁbres Rx := π−1
x (R) where R is
regarded as a standard ﬁbre of (R, πR, M ) and dx : Rx → R are (arbitrarily)
ﬁxed isomorphisms.

R (x) = d−1

1M and T are isomorphic to R3 and R1 respectively. This is insigniﬁcant for the

following.

Bozhidar Z. Iliev: On bundle classical and statistical mechanics

To every function g : F × T → R, we assign a lifting of paths2 g such

that

g : γ 7→ gγ : t 7→ gγ(ξ; t) := d−1

γ(t)(g(ξ; t)) ∈ Rγ(t).

(3.8)

In this way the dynamical algebra D becomes isomorphic to a subalgebra of
the algebra of liftings of paths (or sections along paths) of (R, πR, M ).

For explicitly time-independent dynamical functions, substituting (3.8)

into (3.2), we get

gγ(t) = Vγ(t, t0)gγ(t0),

(3.9)

where, for brevity, we write gγ(t) := gγ(ξ(t); t) = gγ(ξ(t); t0) and

Vγ(t, t0) := d−1

γ(t) ◦ V(t, t0) ◦ dγ(t0)

: Rγ(t0) → Rγ(t).

(3.10)

The map Vγ(t, t0) is linear and, due to (3.5) and (3.6), satisﬁes the equations

V (t3, t1) = V (t3, t2)V (t2, t1),
V (t1, t1) = 1.

(3.11)

(3.12)

The last three equations show that V : γ 7→ Vγ : (t, t0) 7→ Vγ(t, t0) is a linear
transport along paths in (R, πR, M ) (cf. [1] or [9]). We call it the dynamical
transport.

By [10, proposition 5.3] or [1, eq. (3.40)], equation (3.9) is equivalent to

VD (g) = 0

(3.13)

(see [9,

Here VD is the derivation along paths corresponding to V , viz.
deﬁnition 4.1], [11], or [1, deﬁnition 3.4])

VD : PLift1(R, πR, M ) → PLift0(R, πR, M )

where PLiftk(R, πR, M ), k = 0, 1, . . . is the set of C k liftings of paths from
M to R, and its action on a lifting λ ∈ PLift1(R, πR, M ) with λ : γ 7→ λγ is
given via

VD γ

t (λ) := lim

ε

ε→0 (cid:26)
t (λ) := ((VD λ)(γ))(t) = (VD λ)γ(t).

with VD γ

[Vγ(t, t + ε)λγ(t + ε) − λγ(t)]

(3.14)

(cid:27)

The equivalence of (3.13) and the conventional equation of motion (3.1)
can easily be veriﬁed. Therefore (3.13) represents the bundle equation of
motion for dynamical functions.

To conclude, we emphasize on the fact that the application of the bundle
approach, developed in [1, 2], to classical mechanics results only in bundle
description of dynamical functions.

2Equivalently, the mapping g can be regarded as a (multiple-valued) section along

paths; see [1, sect. 3 &4].

4. Bundle description of the Liouville equation

In classical statistical mechanics [8] the evolution of a system is described
via a distribution (function (on the phase space)) P : F × T → R satisfying
dξ P(ξ; t) = 1 and P(ξ; t) ≥ 0, ξ ∈ F, t ∈ T, and whose
the conditions

time evolution is governed by the Liouville equation

RF

∂P
∂t

= LP

(4.1)

with L = L(ξ; t) being the Liouville operator (the Liouvillian) of the in-
vestigated system [8, § 2.2]. If the system is Hamiltonian, i.e. if it can be
described via a Hamiltonian h, its Liouvillian is L = − [h]P.

Since equations (3.1) and (4.1) are similar, we can apply the already de-
veloped ideas and methods to the bundle reformulation of the basic equation
of classical statistical mechanics.

We can write the solution of (4.1) as

P(ξ; t) = W(ξ; t, t0)P(ξ; t0)

(4.2)

where the distribution operator W is deﬁned by the initial-value problem

= L(ξ; t)W(ξ; t, t0), W(ξ; t0, t0) = 1,

(4.3)

∂W(ξ; t, t0)
∂t

t

Rt0

i.e. W(ξ; t, t0) = Texp

L(ξ; τ ) dτ.

Since W satisﬁes (3.5) and (3.6) with W instead of V, a fact that can

easily be checked, the maps

W (ξ; t, t0) := d−1

γ(t) ◦ W(ξ; t, t0) ◦ dγ(t0) : Rγ(t0) → Rγ(t)

(4.4)

satisﬁes (3.11) and (3.12). Therefore these maps deﬁne a transport W along
paths in (R, πR, M ). It can be called the distribution transport.

Now to any distribution P : F × T → R, we assign a (distribution) lifting
P of paths in the ﬁbre bundle (R, πR, M ), introduced in Sect. 3, such that

P : γ 7→ Pγ : t 7→ Pγ(ξ; t) := d−1

γ(t)(P(ξ; t)) ∈ Rγ(t).

(4.5)

The so-deﬁned lifting P : γ → Pγ of paths in (R, πR, M ) is linearly trans-
ported along arbitrary observer’s trajectory γ by means of W .
In fact,
combining (4.2) and (4.5), using (4.5) for t = t0 and (4.4), we get

Pγ(ξ; t) = Wγ(ξ; t, t0)Pγ(ξ; t0)

(4.6)

which proves our assertion. We want to emphasize on the equivalence of (4.6)
and the Liouville equation (4.1), a fact following from the derivation of (4.6)

Bozhidar Z. Iliev: On bundle classical and statistical mechanics

6

and the deﬁnitions of the quantities appearing in it. This result, combined
with [10, proposition 5.3] shows the equivalence of (4.1) with the invariant
equation

W

D(P ) = 0

(4.7)

where WD is the derivation along γ corresponding to W (see (3.14)). The
last equation can naturally be called the bundle Liouville equation.

5. Conclusion

In this paper we tried to apply the methods developed in [1–5] for quantum
mechanics to classical mechanics and classical statistical mechanics. Re-
gardless that these methods are fruitful in quantum mechanics, they do not
work with the same eﬀectiveness in classical mechanics and statistics. The
main reason for this is that these mechanics are more or less theories of
space (and time), i.e. they directly depend on the accepted space (and time)
model. So, since the ﬁbre bundle formalism, we are attempting to trans-
fer from quantum mechanics and statistical to classical ones, is suitable for
describing quantities directly insensitive to the space(-time) model, we can
realize the ideas of [1–5] in the classical region only partially.

In this work we represented dynamical and distribution functions as lift-
ings of paths of a suitably chosen ﬁbre bundle over space. These liftings, as
it was demonstrated, appear to be linearly transported along any observer’s
trajectory with respect to corresponding (possibly parallel) transports along
paths in the bundle mentioned. As a consequence of this fact, the equations
of motion for distributions and time-independent dynamical functions have
one and the same mathematical form: the derivations, generated by the cor-
responding transports, of these liftings vanish along observer’s trajectory.

Thus, we have seen that (some) quantities arising over space admit nat-
ural bundle formulation which is equivalent to the conventional one. We
demonstrated this for time-independent dynamical functions in classical
Hamiltonian mechanics and distribution functions in classical statistical me-
chanics. Other classical quantities also admit bundle description.

The ﬁbre bundle formalism is extremely suitable for describing all sorts of
ﬁelds over space(-time). Therefore it seems naturally applicable to quantum
physics. In particular, this is true for nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum
mechanics (and statistics) whose full self-consistent bundle (re)formulation
we have developed in the series of papers [1–5, 12, 13].

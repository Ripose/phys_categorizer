Abstract

We consider fuzzy spacetime, quanta of area and related concepts
in the context of latest approaches to Quantum Gravity and show its
interface with usual non-Abelian gauge theory. We also discuss in this
context a cosmology which correctly predicted a dark energy driven
acceleratling universe with a small cosmological constant, amongst
other things.

1 Introduction

Inspite of several fruitless decades of work, the two great intellectual pillars
of twentieth century Physics, General Relativity and Quantum Theory have
remained irreconcible though each has proved to be successful in its own
domain. As Wheeler put it [1] the problem is the introduction of spin half
into General Relativity and curvature into Quantum Theory. On the other
hand, inspite of the successes of either theory, there are still a number of
unresolved problems and unless these are addressed, a complete or uniﬁed
description may not be possible. Thus there is the question of spacetime
singularities termed by Wheeler to be the Greatest Crisis of Physics or as
yet directly undetected gravitational waves on the one hand, and on the
other, from the domain of Particle Physics, the existence of some eighteen
arbitrary parameters in the Standard Model, or the elusive monopoles, the
puzzle of the muon g factor or the tiny mass of the neutrino as brought out

by the Superkamiokande experiment and the characterization of the newly
determined dark energy and so on. Even leaving these considerations aside,
the unsatisfactory character of the short distance behavior of the Standard

of ’t Hooft [2], “...the standard model as it stands today cannot be entirely
correct... a reason must be found as to why the forces at short time scales
balance out. The way things are for the elementary particles, at present,
is that the forces balance out just by accident. It would be an inexplicable
accident, and as no other examples of such accidents are known in Nature,
at least not of this magnitude, it is reasonable to suspect that the true short
distance structure is not exactly as described in the Standard Model...”.
It is noteworthy that the two desparate realms of General Relativity and
Quantum Theory nevertheless share a common feature: They operate within
a diﬀerenciable spacetime manifold viz., Reimannian spacetime and Lorentzian
spacetime respectively. Over the past few decades some progress towards the
Quantum Theory of Gravity has been made by discarding the concept of
smooth spacetime, be it in Quantum SuperString Theory or other Quantum
Gravity approaches, as also the one to be described below. In these schemes
there is a minimum spacetime cut oﬀ at the Planck or more generally the
Compton scale. Indeed to quote ’t Hooft himself [3], “It is somewhat puz-
zling to the present author why the lattice structure of space and time had
escaped attention from other investigators up till now...”.

2 The Minimum Cut Oﬀ

To ﬁx physical ideas let us start with the Kerr-Newman metric, applied to
the electron [4]. This purely classical description, amazingly enough, heals
the purely Quantum Mechanical g = 2 factor of the electron, though there
is now a naked singularlity, in that the horizon becomes complex:

r+ =

G2M 2
GM
c2 + ıb, b
c4
G being the gravitational constant, M the mass and a
angular momentum.
On the other hand the position coordinate of the electron from the Dirac
theory [5] is also given by a complex coordinate:

Moreover the imaginary parts in either case (1) and (2) have the same or-
der, that of the electron Compton wavelength. As Dirac argued, Quantum
Mechanical measurements of spacetime points imply inﬁnite energies and mo-
mentum. Meaningful Physics is recovered only on averaging over intervals of
the order of the Compton scale, in which case the complex part of the coor-
dinate disappears (Cf.ref.[5]). Indeed wlithin the Compton scale, unphysical
zitterbewegung and superluminal eﬀects are encountered.
When minimum spacetime intervals are introduced, we immediately have a
non-commutative geometry, as shown by Snyder [6]:

[x, y] = (ıa2/¯h)Lz, [t, x] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mx, etc.
[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2
x];
The relations (3) are compatible with Special Relativity. The ﬁrst of the
relations (3) can be written, for simplicity as:

In (4), if we neglect terms of the
cally the Compton (including the Planck) scale, then we return to the usual
spacetime and the usual Quantum Theory.
The crux is this “Quantum of Area”, which has emerged as an all important
irreduceable unit in the latest theories [7]. Let us now consider the implica-
tions of this minimum area in the usual non-Abelian gauge theory. This will
also show how we go beyond Standard Physics.
As is well known we consider a generalization of the usual phase function λ
to include ﬁelds with internal degrees of freedom [8]. For example λ could
be replaced by Aµ to give the Gauge Field

Aµ =

Aı

µ(x)Lı,

X

The Gauge Field itself would be obtained by a very well known procedure:

Fµν = ∂µAν −

∂νAµ −
q being the Gauge Field coupling constant.
In (6), the second term on the right side is typical of a non Abelian Gauge
Field. As is well known, in a typical Lagrangian like

D denoting the Gauge covariant derivative, there is no mass term for the
ﬁeld Bosons. Such a mass term in (7) must have the form m2AµAµ which
unfortunately is not Gauge invariant.
To generate massive gauge bosons, in analogy with superconductivity theory,
an extra phase of a self coherent system (Cf.ref.[8] for a simple and elegant
treatment) has been introduced, as is well known. Thus instead of the Gauge
Field Aµ, we consider a new phase adjusted Gauge Field after the symmetry
is broken

Wµ = Aµ −

The ﬁeld Wµ now generates the mass in a self consistent manner via a Higgs
mechanism. Infact the kinetic energy term

Equation (8) gives the mass in terms of the ground state φ0.
It must be remembered that the symmetry breaking of the gauge ﬁeld is
a short length scale phenomenon signifying the fact that the ﬁeld is medi-
ated by particles with large mass. Further the internal symmetry space of
the gauge ﬁeld is broken by an external constraint: the wave function has
an intrinsic relative phase factor which is a diﬀerent function of space time
coordinates compared to the phase change necessitated by the minimum cou-
pling requirement for a free particle with the gauge potential. This cannot
be achieved for an ordinary point like particle, but a new type of a physi-
cal system, like the self coherent system of Superconductivity Theory now
interacts with the gauge ﬁeld. The second or extra term in (6) is eﬀectively
an external ﬁeld, though (6) manifests itself only in a relatively small spatial
interval. The φ or Higgs ﬁeld in (6), in analogy with the phase function of
Cooper pairs of Superconductivity Theory comes with the Landau-Ginzburg
potential V (φ).
Let us now consider in the Gauge Field transformation, an additional phase
term, f (x), this being a scalar[9]. In the usual theory such a term can al-
ways be gauged away in the U(1) electromagnetic group. However we now
consider the new situation of a noncommutative geometry referred to above,

[dxµ, dxν] = Θµνβ, β

where l2 denotes the minimum spacetime cut oﬀ. (Cf. also ref.[10, 11]) (11)
is infact Lorentz covariant. Then the f phase factor gives a contribution to

where Bµ ≡
As can be seen from (10) and (9), the new contribution is in the term which
contains the commutator of the coordinate diﬀerentials, and not in the sym-
metric second term. Eﬀectively, remembering that Bµ arises from the scalar
phase factor, and not from the non-Abelian Gauge Field, Aµ is replaced by

Aµ →

Aµ + Bµ = Aµ + ∂µf

(13)

Comparing (13) with (6) we can immediately see that the eﬀect of noncom-
mutativity is precisely that of providing a new symmetry breaking term to
the Gauge Field, a term which does not come from the Gauge Field itself.
Being an 0(l2) eﬀect, it manifests itself only at small scales, as required.
Eﬀectively, because of (13) we would have, specializing to a spherically sym-
metric ﬁeld for simplicity, instead of the usual Maxwell equations in the gauge
ﬁeld context,

So we have for a point Gauge charge, the modiﬁed equation

In (15) and (16) λ(r) represents the eﬀect of the noncommutativity and is
an order of l2 eﬀect, that is it falls oﬀ rapidly. It can be seen that the ﬁrst
term in the integral on the right side of (16) gives, in conjunction with (14)
the usual Coulumb type of a ﬁeld. It is the second term in the integral which
represents a ﬁeld due to the noncommutativity of spacetime, which falls oﬀ
rapidly, as it vanishes at scales where order of l2 can be neglected. As such
it represents a ﬁeld mediated by massive particles.

(This is a well known example from the early days of Yang-Mills Theory,
which lead to the conclusion that there was a Coulumb type potential of
electromagnetism, that is a ﬁeld without any mass.)
It may be remarked that a similar argument using equations like (11) and (12)
has been used by the author to argue that one could obtain a reconciliation
of electromagnetism and gravitation [11].

3 Cosmology

We consider a Cosmology in which given the well known N
tary particles, typically pions in the universe, it follows that the pions can
be thought of as being created from a Quantum vaccuum, in a phase tran-
1040 Planck particles on the lines of the Prigogine Cosmology
sition by n
(Cf.ref.[12, 13, 14]). Infact let us think of the unit Quanta of Area. In the
Quantum vaccuum as being oriented randomly, that is their normals being
randomly distributed focussing our attention on the normals, we have a sit-
uation similar to the Ising Model. Furthermore considering the amplitudes
of these elementary elements of the Quantum vaccuum, we have (Cf.ref.[4])
a non linear Schrodinger equation,

It can be seen from (19) that this is just the Compton length. In other words
the Schrodinger equation (17) describes a Landau-Ginsburg like phase tran-
sition, as in the Ising Model, and the normals get oriented.
As is well known the interesting aspects of this critical point theory (Cf.ref.[15])are
universality and scale. Broadly, this means that diverse physical phenomena
follow the same route at the critical point, on the one hand, and on the other
this can happen at diﬀerent scales, as exempliﬁed for example, by the course

graining techniques of the Renormalization Group. To highlight this point
we note that in critical point phenomena we have the reduced order param-
eter ¯Q and the reduced correlation length ¯ξ. Near the critical point we have
relations like

This gives

(21)

In the above phase transition in which the Planck oscillators and elementary
particles are created, given N particles at any stage, √N particles are ﬂuc-
tuationally created in the minimum spacetime cut oﬀ intervals l, τ , rather on
the lines of Hayakawa [16]. Indeed we will see that this is related to the Mod-
iﬁed Uncertainty Principle which itself arises due to the minimum spacetime
cut oﬀ.
To proceed, it was shown in the above references that

M = √nmP , m = √n′mP

(22)

where M and m denote the mass of the universe and the mass of the pion and
mP the Planck mass. In the following we will use N as the sole cosmological
parameter.
Equating the gravitational potential energy of the pion in a three dimensional
isotropic sphere of pions of radius R, the radius of the universe, with the rest
energy of the pion, we can deduce the well known relation [17, 16]

where M can be obtained from (22).
We now use the ﬂuctuation in the particle number of the order √N [16, 18, 19]
h/mc2, the Planck (or
while a typical time interval for the ﬂuctuations is
Compton) time. We will come back to this point later but as mentioned this

with a similar equation for N. Whence on integration we get,

We can easily verify that equation (24) is indeed satisﬁed where T is the age

steps we get

where H in (25) can be identiﬁed with the Hubble Constant, and using (22)
and (23) is given by,

H = GmP /(c2τP R) =

Equation (23) and (24) show that in this formulation, the correct mass, radius

Equation (27) has been empirically known as an “accidental” or “mysterious”
relation. As observed by Weinberg [20], this is unexplained: it relates a single
cosmological parameter H to constants from microphysics. We will touch
upon this micro-macro nexus again. In our formulation, equation (27) is no
longer a mysterious coincidence but rather a consequence.

where in (30), we have used (24). Following Dirac (cf. also [22] we get G
as the variable, rather than the quantities m, l, c and ¯h (which we will call
microphysical constants) because of their central role in atomic (and sub
atomic) physics.
Next if we use G from (30) in (26), we can see that

Thus apart from the fact that H has the same inverse time dependance on

Using (23), we can now deduce that

required for closure. But the work of Perlmutter and others as also observa-
tions from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey has conﬁrmed the view [23].

4 Discussion

We will now argue that gravitation can be considered to be a residual eﬀect
which are on the lines of the Sakharov Model. As noted, it was shown that
the pion and the universe itself could be thought of as being made up of
Planck oscillators (Cf.ref.[13, 14]) infact denoting a typical frequency by ω
where

ω = mc2/¯h

ω = ωP lP /l

we have

(34)

∼

1040 Planck oscillators. For the universe with n′

where the subscript P denotes the Planck scale and l would be for the pion,
its Compton scale and for the universe itself it would denote R. For the pion
(34) gives the pion mass m, which shows that the pion is the lowest energy
10120 Planck
state of
oscillators, l on the right side of (34) would be the radius R and then the
left side would yield the lowest energy state in this case. The highest energy
state of n′ oscillators would then be, n′ω which on using (34) yields the
correct mass of the universe. Moreover the inverse dependance on distance,
of the energy, in (34) indicates that the energy would also be characterized
as the potential energy of an inverse square interaction, for example the
gravitational interaction. In that case, R = GN
c2 which on using (34) gives for
the equation

∼

G = lc2/m√N =

l¯h
m2T ≡

γ
T

(35)

What this means is that without taking recourse to gravitation in the ﬁrst
instance and using the fact that the energy is that of the underpinning of
normal mode of Planck oscillators, it then follows that gravitation shows up
as a manifestation of this energy, distributed over N particles of the universe.
Thus gravitation is now reduced to the status of a statistical measure of
residual energies as in Sakharov’s formulation using the Planck scale [1] as
is conﬁrmed by (28).

2. In the Bekenstelin Black Hole Radiation Formula if we introduce for G, it
is time dependent version (35) then we get for the radiation time, instead of
the usual expression

M being the mass of the Schwarschild Black Hole, this time

whence we have

T = ΘM

(36)

One can easily verify that (36) gives the Planck time for a Planck mass and
1017 seconds, the age of the universe, for M the mass of the universe
T
itself. Alternatively (36) can be written as

∼

T /tP = M/mP

which is also easily veriﬁed to be true.
3. Another way of interpreting the result in the previous section is that
the area of a pion is n times the elemental Planck area as in the Quantum
Gravity description, and similarly the area of the universe is N times the
elementary particle area. That the area shows up as being fundamental can
be interpreted as due to the two dimensionality of the Brownian Quantum
path in (21), now viewed as a random walk equation as discussed in [13, 14].
4. Finally, it may be remarked that the above characterization of G, not only
reproduces standard results like the bending of light or the precession of the
perihelion of Mercury, but also provides an explanation for the otherwise
inexplicable anomalous accelerations of the Pioneer spacecrafts [24, 25].

In this paper, we deal with ﬂuid motion in terms of quan-
tum mechanics. Mechanism accounting for the appearance of
quantum behavior is discussed.

Consider a ideal ﬂuid which is composed of discrete
identical particles, its mass and charge are m and q re-
spectively, it is convenient to consider the ﬂuid to be a
ﬂow characterized by a 4-velocity ﬁeld u(x1, x2, x3, x4 =
ict) in a Cartesian coordinate system (in a laboratory
frame of reference). The particle will be aﬀected by the
4-force due to in electromagnetic interaction. According
to relativistic Newton’s second law, the motion of the
particle satisﬁes the following governing equations

duµ
dτ

= qFµν uν

m
uµuµ = −c2

where Fµν is the 4-curl of electromagnetic vector poten-
tial A. Since the reference frame is a Cartesian coordi-
nate system whose axes are orthogonal to one another,
there is no distinction between covariant and contravari-
ant components, only subscripts need be used. Here and
below, summation over twice repeated indices is implied
in all case, Greek indices will take on the values 1,2,3,4,
and regarding the mass m as a constant. Eq.(1) and (2)
stand at every point for every particle. As is mentioned
above, the 4-velocity u can be regarded as a 4-velocity
vector ﬁeld, then

dτ

=

∂uµ
∂xν

∂xν
∂τ

= uν∂ν uµ

qFµν uν = quν(∂µAν − ∂νAµ)

Substituting them back into Eq.(1), and re-arranging
their terms, we obtain

uν∂ν(muµ + qAµ) = uν∂µ(qAν )

we have

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν) − uν∂µ(muν)

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν) −

∂µ(muνuν)

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν) −

∂µ(−mc2)

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν)

Using the notation

Kµν = ∂µ(muν + qAν ) − ∂ν(muµ + qAµ)

(6)

Eq.(5) is given by

uνKµν = 0

(9)

Because Kµν contains the variables ∂µuν, ∂µAν , ∂νuµ
and ∂νAµ which are independent from uν, then a solution
satisfying Eq.(7) is of

Kµν = 0

∂µ(muν + qAν ) = ∂ν(muµ + qAµ)

The above equation allows us introduce a potential func-
tion Φ in mathematics, further set Φ = −i¯h ln ψ, we ob-
tain a very important equation

(muµ + qAµ)ψ = −i¯h∂µψ

(10)

We think it as an extended form of the relativistic New-
ton’s second law in terms of 4-velocity ﬁeld. ψ repre-
senting the wave nature may be a complex mathematical
function, its physical meanings will be determined from
experiments after the introduction of the Planck’s con-
stant ¯h.

Multiplying the two sides of the following familiar

equation by ψ

− m2c4

= m2uµuµ

(11)

which stands at every points in the 4-velocity ﬁeld, and
using Eq.(10), we obtain

− m2c4ψ = muµ(−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)ψ

= (−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)(muµψ) − [−i¯hψ∂µ(muµ)]
= (−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)2ψ − [−i¯hψ∂µ(muµ)]

(12)

According to the continuity condition for the ﬂuid

∂µ(muµ) = 0

− m2c4ψ = (−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)2ψ

Its form is known as the Klein-Gordon equation.

On the condition of non-relativity, the Schrodinger
equation form can be derived from the Klein-Gordon
equation [2](P.469).

However, we must admit that we are careless when
we use the continuity condition Eq.(13), because, from
Eq.(10) we obtain

where αn are the Pauli spin matrices, n = 1, 2, 3. Sub-
stituting them into Eq.(22), we obtain

[(−i¯h∂4 − qA4) + αn(−i¯h∂n − qAn) + βmc2]ψ = 0 (27)

where ψ is an one-column matrix about ψ(k). The form
of Eq.(27) is known as the Dirac equation.

Of course, on the condition of non-relativity, the
Schrodinger equation form can be derived from the Dirac
equation [2](P.479).

It is noted that Eq.(27), Eq.(22), Eq.(17) and Eq.(16)
are equivalent despite they have the diﬀerent forms, be-
cause they all originate from Eq.(10) and Eq.(11).

It follows from Eq.(10) that the path of a particle is
analogous to ”lines of electric force” in 4-dimensional
space-time. In the case that the Klein-Gordon equation
stands, i.e. Eq.(13) stands, at any point, the path can
have but one direction (i.e. the local 4-velocity direction),
hence only one path can pass through each point of the
space-time. In other words, the path never intersects it-
self when it winds up itself into a cell about a nucleus.
No path originates or terminates in the space-time. But,
in general, the divergence of the 4-velocity ﬁeld does not
equal to zero, as indicated in Eq.(15), so the Dirac equa-
tion would be better than the Klein-Gordon equation in
accuracy.

Based on the above derivation, we conﬁrm that the
dynamic condition of appearance of quantum behavior in
ﬂuid is that the Planck’s constant ¯h is not relatively small
in analogy with that for single particle, the condition
of the appearance of spin structure in the ﬂuid is that
Eq.(15) is un-negligeable. The mechanism profoundly
accounts for the quantum wave natures such as spin eﬀect
[4] [5].

The present work focus on the formalism and pursuing
the correction and strictness in mathematics, its interpre-
tation in physical terms remains to be discussed further
in the future.

where we have used the Lorentz gauge condition. Thus
from Eq.(11) to Eq.(12) we obtain

− m2c4ψ = (−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)2ψ + ¯h2ψ∂µ∂µ ln ψ

(16)

This is of a perfect wave equation for describing accu-
rately the motion of the ﬂow. In other wards, The Klein-
Gordon equation form is ill for using the mistaken con-
tinuity condition Eq.(13). Comparing with the Dirac
equation result, we ﬁnd that the last term of Eq.(16)
corresponds to the spin eﬀect of ﬂow (if it exists). In the
following we shall show the Dirac equation form from
Eq.(10) and Eq.(11).

In general, there are many wave functions which sat-
isfy Eq.(10) for the ﬂow, these functions and correspond-
ing momentum components are denoted by ψ(j)and
Pµ(j) = muµ(j), respectively, where j = 1, 2, 3, ..., N,
then Eq.(11) can be given by

0 = Pµ(j)Pµ(j)ψ2(j) + m2c4ψ2(j)

= δµν Pµ(j)ψ(j)Pν (j)ψ(j) + mc2ψ(j)mc2ψ(j)
= (δµν + δνµ)Pµ(j)ψ(j)Pν (j)ψ(j)(µ ≥ ν)

+mc2ψ(j)mc2ψ(j)

= 2δµνPµ(j)ψ(j)Pν (j)ψ(j)(µ ≥ ν)

+mc2ψ(j)mc2ψ(j)

= 2δµνδjkδjlPµ(k)ψ(k)Pν (l)ψ(l)(µ ≥ ν)

+δjkδjlmc2ψ(k)mc2ψ(l)

where δ is the Kronecker delta function,
j, k, l =
1, 2, 3, ..., N . Here, specially, we do not take j sum over;
P represents momentum, not operator. Suppose there
are two matrices a and b which satisfy

aµjkaνjl + aνjkaµjl = 2δµνδjkδjl

aµjkbjl + bjkaµjl = 0

bjkbjl = δjkδjl

then Eq.(17) can be rewritten as

0 = (aµjkaνjl + aνjkaµjl)Pµ(k)ψ(k)Pν (l)ψ(l)(µ ≥ ν)

+(aµjkbjl + bjkaµjl)Pµ(k)ψ(k)mc2ψ(l)
+bjkbjlmc2ψ(k)mc2ψ(l)

= [aµjkPµ(k)ψ(k) + bjkmc2ψ(k)]
·[aνjlPν (l)ψ(l) + bjlmc2ψ(l)]
= [aµjkPµ(k)ψ(k) + bjkmc2ψ(k)]

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

Anastasios Mallios

Dedicated to the memory of the late Professor Klaus Floret

Abstract

The paper concerns the ﬁctitious entanglement of the so-called “singulari-

ties” in problems, pertaining to quantum gravity, due, in point of fact, to the

way we try to employ, in that context, diﬀerential geometry, the latter being

associated, in eﬀect, by far, classically (:smooth manifolds), on the basis of an

erroneous correspondence between what we may call/understand, as “physical

space” and the “cartesian-newtonian” one.

1. The two issues in the title of this article are only, seemingly (!), diﬀer-

ent, while, as we shall see, they are,

in eﬀect,

in a very concrete sense, quite

tautosemous. So, when we try to quantize gravity, we are inevitably confronted

(cf. e.g. (3.14) below) with the so-called, thus far, “singularities”, that is, with the

emerging “inﬁnities” etc (referred, of course, always to our (!) calculations), some-

thing, that certainly remind us of the characteristic, in that context, relevant remarks

of P.A.M. Dirac, already from 1975, see thus [7: p. 36], in that;

“... sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it turns

(1.1)

out to be small not neglecting it just because it is inﬁnitely great and

you do not want it”.

or even P.A.M. Dirac [8: p. 85], that:

(1.1′)

“Some day a new quantum mechanics, a relativistic one, will be discov-

ered, in which we will not have ... inﬁnities at all [(!)].”

[Emphasis above is ours; this will also be, in principle, the case when referring to

quotations, throughout the present work, unless otherwise is stated]. Accordingly,

by coming back to our subject,

the ﬁrst item, as in the title of this paper, is, in point of fact, reducible to

(1.2)

the second one, or, equivalently, the famous problem of the quantization

of gravity is virtually subject to that one of the so-called “singularities”.

In this connection, we can still refer to the criticism of R.P. Feynman thereof [10: p.

166], pertaining thus to the use of the notion of “continuum” in the quantum deep,

in that:

“...

the theory that space is continuous is wrong, because we get ....

(1.3)

inﬁnities and other diﬃculties ... [while] the simple ideas of geometry,

extended down into inﬁnitely small ... are wrong!”

Now, the problem here lies essentially with our blocked intension/endevour to as-

sociate our (technical) theory (: “geometry”) with physis (: natural laws). In this

regard, see also our previous relevant comments in A. Mallios [19], or even in [22].

On the other hand, within the above vein of ideas, we can also quote here C.J. Isham

[15: p. 393], when remarking that;

“... at the Plank-length scale, classical diﬀerential geometry is simply

(1.4)

incompatible with quantum theory .... [hence] one will not be able to use

diﬀerential geometry in the true quantum gravity theory ...”

Here again, as it was similarly the case with (1.3), the problem is not with the

(classical) diﬀerential geometry itself, even at the Plank-length scale (!), when ma-

thematically speaking (there are no, in eﬀect, such inherent restrictions on the Rie-

mannian/Lorentzian, or on any other, whatsoever, type of “metric-geometry”, by its

very deﬁnition, pertaining to the “metric”, read, to the “space”, we use), but only

with the extent to which we wish, in that context, to apply the framework (!) of that

classical theory, as a model, for a mathematical-physical theory, to describe thus a

physical situation; viz. the quantum domain, alias the physical laws governing that

particular (physical) r´egime. So it is worthwhile to point out here, once more, that,

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

3

the manner we try to apply, so far, the classical diﬀerential geometry

(CDG) always refers to its standard framework, viz. to the theory of
diﬀerential (i.e., smooth, or even C∞-)manifolds, and not (!), to its in-
herent (“leibnizian”, so to say) mechanism, as the latter aspect has been

(1.5)

just exhibited, by the “abstract diﬀerential geometry” (ADG); the same

still aﬀords, as we shall see, a quite diﬀerent perspective from that one

of the classical case, concerning thus potential applicabilities of ADG,

provided we have also suitably chosen, so to say, our “diﬀerentiable func-

tions” (: “generalized arithmetics”, in the latter context; cf., for instance,

(3.10) in the sequel).

The above diversiﬁcations from standard aspects, so far, of the same matter, will

become progressively clearer, through the subsequent discussion.

Now, continuing further, within the previous point of view, as it concerns the

applicability of the notion of the “continuum” (: space-time) in problems of quantum

gravity we can still quote here A. Einstein himself, who, since 1916, already, has

declared, indeed, in a pretty caustic manner, that;

(1.6)

“... continuum space-time ... should be banned from theory as a supple-
mentary construction not justiﬁed by the essence of the problem− a

construction which corresponds to nothing real [(!)]”.

See, for instance, J. Stachel [33: p. 280]. So we have actually been warned, already,

either directly (Einstein), or indirectly (Feynman, Isham) for the inappropriateness

of combining classical diﬀerential geometry with quantum theory (!).

On the other hand, R. Geroch (1968), trying to explain the situation one has

with the “singularities” in general relativity, he further notes that;

“... general relativity diﬀers from [other ﬁeld theories] in one important

respect: ... one has [in those theories] a background (Minkowskian) me-

(1.7)

tric to which the ﬁeld quantities can be referred, [while] in general rela-

tivity the “background metric” is the very ﬁeld whose singularities one

wishes to describe”.

See R. Geroch [12]. Furthermore, we have a recent similar criticism to (1.7), as

above, by J. Baez [1: p.v; Preface], as it actually concerns quantization of gravity,

by remarking that:

4

Anastasios Mallios

“A fundamental problem with quantum gravity ... is that in ... general

(1.8)

relativity there is no background geometry to work with: the geometry

of spacetime itself becomes a dynamical variable.”

Consequently, as an upshot of the preceding discussion, we do eﬀectuate that;

(1.9)

the fact that in general relativity one is compelled, by the very essence of

the theory, to consider the “geometry” itself, as a “dynamical variable”,

is a fundamental issue (problem) in quantizing gravity, the same being

also intimately connected with the so-called “singularities” of the theory.

2. ADG, as a potential response.− It is now our goal, by the subsequent

account, to show that the aforesaid, throughout the preceding discussion, obstacles,

which appear when trying to cope with problems of quantum gravity, within the

standard set-up (: diﬀerential–smooth–manifolds) of the classical diﬀerential geom-

etry, do not appear, at all, when looking at the matter, within the context of ADG

(: abstract diﬀerential geometry), according to the very deﬁnition of the latter: In-

deed, it is thus a basic moral of the same point of view (ADG), that;

to perform “diﬀerential geometry”, no “space” is virtually required (in

the usual sense of the standard theory (CDG), viz. a smooth mani-

(2.1)

fold), provided that one is equipped with a “basic diﬀerential”, ∂, alias

“dx”, along with the appropriate “diﬀerential-geometric mechanism”,

that might be aﬀorded thereby.

Thus, it is still a basic upshot of the very context of ADG (see also (2.1), along with

(3.13) in the sequel) that the problem (see e.g. (1.8), as well as, (1.9), as above) of

making the “geometry” into a “dynamical variable” is simply begging

(2.2)

the question !

In this regard see also A. Mallios-I. Raptis [23], [24], [25]. On the other hand, con-

tinuing further, within the preceding vein of ideas, by turning back again to the

situation, that is connected with the so-called “Plank-length scale” (cf. (1.4) above,

along with the ensuing comments therein), we can still remark, yet, here too, by

virtue of the same character of ADG (see also, for instance, A. Mallios [19: (9.34),

and comments following it]), that,

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

5

(2.3)

the (physical) “geometry”, one has in the “Plank-length scale” does

not actually diﬀer, in principle, as well as, in substance (nature), from

that one, we have, anywhere else (“physis is united” (!), we suppose);

yet, nature, viz.

the physical “geometry”, still, in other words, what

we perceive, as such, is not, at all, our own.

Indeed, the latter term

(: “geometry”) concerns, in point of fact, simply our own technical (!)

(: mathematical) device (in eﬀect, “cartesian” (!), thus far) to describe

(: to model) the former.

In this regard, cf. also here A. Mallios [22]. Indeed, as it was already hinted at in

(2.3), we should still remark herewith, that:

what we usually understand as (mean by a), “physical geometry”−we

(2.4)

are thus trapped still, by our own mathematical conception of it, in that
context−is, in point of fact, the “cartesian” one, either globally (e.g.

aﬃne space), or even locally (thus, manifold, e.g. the so-called “space-

time”).

In this connection, see also A. Mallios [19: (8.5)]. Consequently,

what we actually perceive (: deﬁne), as “space”, is that one, which, in

eﬀect, may be called “cartesian” (or even, “newtonian”) one, hence, not,

in anyway, the real “physical” one, which we may still name “euclidean”

(see also loc. cit., as above). So the latter is, in point of fact, simply,

(2.5)

(2.5.1)

that, what constitutes it (!),

loc.cit.; (1.1), (1.4); viz., in other words, that, what we can still call,

(2.5.2)

“les objets g´eom´etriques”,

in the sense of Leibniz (the same Ref.; (2.1)).

On the other hand, as already explained elsewhere (cf., for instance, the same Ref.,

as above), ADG is exactly referred to these “objets g´eom´etriques”, `a la Leibniz, as

before, the same being also, of course, the “varying objects”. Thus, ADG appears

too to be in accord with the point of view of general relativity, let alone, without

6

Anastasios Mallios

any need to resort to a particular “background geometry (space)”, to work with (!)

(see, for example, (1.8) in the preceding). Indeed,

the (diﬀerential-)geometric mechanism, in the formalism of ADG, does

(2.6)

not depend on (emanate from) any “background space”, in the sense that

the latter term is, at least, understood in the classical theory (CDG).

In this regard, see also A. Mallios [19:

in particular, (6.1), or even (9.8), therein],

yet, A. Mallios [22]. We further elaborate on (explain) our previous comments, as

in (2.6) above, in a more technical manner, straightforwardly, by the subsequent

Section.

3. ADG, technically speaking.− As already hinted at, just before, we come

now, by the subsequent discussion, to sustain the aspect, this being also another

fundamental issue of the whole formalism of ADG, that:

within the setting of ADG, the “geometry” itself, in the sense that this

notion is really understood, in that context (cf., for example, (3.2), as

well as, (3.3) in the sequel) is already, by its very deﬁnition (ibid.),

(3.1)

a “dynamical variable”, therefore, by itself, of a relativistic nature (!),

while, as we shall also see, by the ensuing discussion, it still appears,

as such, thus far, concerning our relevant equations, as well (cf. thus

Section 5 in the sequel).

Thus, to start with, by referring to “geometry”, within the framework of ADG,

one virtually means the construction of a “geometrical calculus”, just, quite in the

sense of Leibniz (see, for example, A. Mallios [19: beginning of Section 1]), referring

thus exclusively to interrelations of what one considers, herewith, as “geometrical

objects”, hence, for the case in focus, of the “vector sheaves” involved; therefore, by

employing physical terms, the aforesaid “calculus” (being, as it is actually deﬁned (!),

of a “diﬀerential-geometric” character,

in the classical sense of the latter term)

refers directly to the “elementary particles” (alias, “ﬁelds”) themselves (see also (3.2)

below). So, up to this point, we virtually consider the following “identiﬁcations”:

(3.2)

“geometric object” ←→ vector sheaf
←→ elementary particle
←→ “ﬁeld”.

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

7

Indeed, as we shall see, right below (cf. thus (3.3) in the sequel), the above will

be appropriately supplemented, when further applying physical terminology.

In

this regard, see also A. Mallios [22], for a fuller account of the nowadays notion of

“geometry”, yet, in perspective with physics.

On the other hand, the term “interrelation”, as applied in the foregoing, means,

by its very deﬁnition, a morphism between the respective sheaves (alias, a “sheaf-

morphism”, the most important of all, when, in particular, referring to a “diﬀerential-
geometric” syllabus, within the relevant setup, being, what we call, an A-connection

(cf. (3.5) in the sequel). In point of fact, this particular morphism appears, as we

shall see (cf. thus (5.1), or even (5.19) in the sequel), within the pertinent equa-

tions, in the form, as we say, of an “invariant morphism”, something, of course, of

paramount physical importance (cf., for instance, “gauge principle”); yet, technically
speaking, in the form of an “A-invariant morphism”, which, for the case at issue,
is the respective curvature (: “ﬁeld strength”) of the A-connection concerned (loc.

cit.).

(3.3)

have:

Thus, to put the above into a better perspective, explaining also, at the same

time, the previously applied terminology, we come ﬁrst, as already promised, for

that matter, to the following amendment (: supplement) of our previous schematic

version of the inherent situation herewith, as described in the preceding, at ﬁrst

sight, by (3.2). So one gets at the following associations (: identiﬁcations), in view

of (3.2), this being, in eﬀect, a more intrinsic (yet, in technical terms) aspect of the

matter. That is, one has;

“geometric object”, `a la Leibniz, ←→ elementary particle ←→ “ﬁeld”
←→ Yang-Mills ﬁeld, viz., a pair,

(3.3.1)

(E, D).

We explain, right away, the above employed terminology, term by term. Thus, we

i) “geometric object” (`a la Leibniz).− We have already mentioned elsewhere (see

A. Mallios [19: Section 1]) that G. W. von Leibniz, just at his time, demanded

a “geometrical calculus” (“calcul g´eom´etrique”, see, for instance, N. Bourbaki [4:

Chap. I; p. 161 (Note historique), ft. 1]) to be found, which should act directly on

8

Anastasios Mallios

the “geometrical objects”, without the intervention of coordinates, that is, in other

words, of any “location of the objects in the “space” ”; of course, concerning the latter

function, one certainly needs thereon a “reference point” (alias, an “origin” (!)).

However, this “ﬁxation”, in our case, “accompanies”, in eﬀect, as we shall see (cf.

thus, for instance, iv) below), viz. “varies” with the (geometrical) object at issue
(: vector sheaf, cf. (3.2), hence, by deﬁnition, a reference point–“space”–A, adjusted

thus to the object, under consideration). Of course, the latter issue is of an extremely

important signiﬁcance, pertaining to a “relativistic perspective” of the whole matter

(cf. also (3.1), as above).

ii) elementary particle.− Now, being primarily interested herewith in potential

applications of the present point of view to quantum gravity, as also the title of this

article indicates, it is natural, in principle, to associate (: in point of fact, to identify)

the “geometric objects”, as above, with the “elementary particles”; in other words,

the geometrical objects, yet, in the sense of Leibniz, which still, for that matter, ﬁll

up the “space”.

In this connection, see also A. Mallios (loc. cit.), as well as, [20:

(7.2), and subsequent remarks therein].

iii) “ﬁeld”.− It is certainly natural to associate the “ultimate constituents of the

matter” (: elementary particles) with the notion of a “ﬁeld”, which is also considered

(see, for instance, A. Einstein [9: p. 140]), as an “independent, not further reducible

fundamental concept”, the same correspondence, as above, being still rooted on the

classical “duality”/identiﬁcation. Now, by further employing mathematical termi-

nology, we come to the ﬁnal association/identiﬁcation, as indicated in (3.3) above,

that is, to the fundamental notion, concerning, in eﬀect, the whole account of ADG,

namely, that one of a

iv) Yang-Mills ﬁeld, (E, D).− Now, the terminology we apply herewith is quite

technical, concerning actually, the intrinsic formalism of ADG, for which we refer

to A. Mallios [16] [17], or even to [21]. So, for convenience, we recall that the pair

(3.4)

(E, D),

as in (3.3.1) above, consists of a vector sheaf E on an (arbitrary, in principle) topo-
logical space X, that is, of a locally free A-module on X, of ﬁnite rank n ∈ N,
relative to an algebra sheaf A on X, along with a given A-connection D on E; now,

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

9

the latter is, by deﬁnition, a sheaf morphism,

(3.5)

D : E −→ E ⊗A Ω1,

which is C-linear (here the (constant) sheaf C of the complexes is, by assumption,
contained in A, see thus (3.10) below), that also satisﬁes the pertinent herewith

“Leibniz condition”: viz. one has the relation,

(3.6)

D(α · s) = α · D(s) + s ⊗ ∂(α),

for any (continuous) local sections α ∈ A(U ) and s ∈ E(U ), with U an open subset

of X, such that

(3.7)

(3.8)

(A, ∂, Ω1

)

∂ : A −→ Ω1

is a given diﬀerential triad on X. Furthermore, Ω1 stands here for an A-module on
X (that occasionally might be too a vector sheaf on X), while

is also a morphism, having analogous properties to D, as above (we call it, the
standard, or even, the basic A-connection of A); so the corresponding here with

Leibniz condition for ∂ is now reduced to the relation,

(3.9)

∂(α · β) = α · ∂(β) + β · ∂(α),

valid, for any α, β in A(U ), with U ⊆ X, as in the preceding. Yet, A is, by
hypothesis, a unital and commutative C-algebra sheaf on X, such that one has
(: canonical injection),

On the other hand, in the special case that the rank of E, as before, equals 1, viz.

(3.10)

when one has,

C ⊂
−→ε

A.

(3.11)

rkAE ≡ rkE = 1,

10

Anastasios Mallios

then E is called, in particular, a line sheaf on X, that is also denoted by L, while

the corresponding pair, as in (3.4), by

(3.12)

(L, D),

that is still named a Maxwell ﬁeld on X. In this connection, we further note that

the electromagnetic ﬁeld is, of course (!), a Maxwell ﬁeld, in the previous sense, that

was also our primary motivation to the above employed terminology; however, see

also Yu.I. Manin [29], or even [30], as well as, A. Mallios [21: Chapt. III]. In this

context, we also remark that, in general, bosons are characterized (: identiﬁed with)

Maxwell ﬁelds, while fermions are similarly associated with Yang-Mills ﬁelds, that
is, with pairs (E, D), as in (3.4) above, for which one has rkE = n > 1. However,

for a fuller, as well as, a more precise account thereon, we still refer to A. Mallios

[20], or even to [21: Chapt. II].

subsequent Section, that;

Thus, after the above brief technical account, we are next going to show, by the

based on the above interpretation of the notion of a “ﬁeld”, and, still in

conjunction with the very formalism of ADG, we are, in eﬀect, able to

(3.13)

look at “the ﬁeld itself, as a dynamical variable”, a fact that, of course,

we were always intensively looking for, thus far, when, in particular,

confronted with problems of the “quantum deep”,

following thus, in that context, the slogan that,

“the ﬁeld itself is (to be considered, as it actually is (!), for that matter,

(3.14)

as) a dynamical variable”.

So the application here of ADG aﬀords the above possibility, as in (3.13), while also,

let alone, that

(viz., apart from having the situation, as described by (3.14)) we are

(3.15)

not, moreover, compelled to resort to any background “space” (alias,

“geometry”), “to work with” (cf. thus the relevant comments of J. Baez,

as in (1.8) in the preceding).

On the other hand, the situation, as described, by the latter part of (3.15), was virtu-

ally the case (loc. cit.) in the standard theory (CDG), when referring, in particular,

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

11

to the quantization of the other forces of nature, alas (!), except gravity (: general

relativity).

Accordingly, the shortage of an analogous situation with that one, as this was

described by (3.15), when, in particular, referring to general relativity, within the

classical framework (: CDG), while being especially confronted, in that context, with

problems of the quantum deep (let alone with those, pertaining to (3.14), as above,

(viz. with “inﬁnities” (!)), seems to be, thus far, a “fundamental culprit” of the

whole issue.

conclusion that:

On the other hand, based here, simply, on our experience from ADG, the fol-

lowing comments being, in point of fact, the main moral, thereby, one comes to the

the aforementioned shortage of the classical theory (CDG), as this, in

particular, concerns quantization of general relativity, seems to arrive,

as a result, thus far, of our insistence on having,

the classical “dx” (hence, the whole standard diﬀerential-

geometric mechanism thereof, yet, another conclusion here of

ADG (!)), only from a “local presence” of the classical carte-
sian Rn, while, on the other hand, we still insist to retain, as
well, as a whole (!), that particular local presence of the same

“space”;

(3.16)

(3.16.1)

that is, the (smooth) manifold concept itself, concerning our calcula-

tions, (!), something, indeed, of a paramount inconvenience, pertaining

to the aforesaid context.

We are going now, through the ensuing discussion in the following Section 4, to

illuminate, as well as, further support the preceding, by referring directly to the

nature and the type too of fundamental diﬀerential equations of the classical theory,

that the latter acquire, when perceived from the point of view of the abstract setup,

as above.

4. Diﬀerential equations, within the setting of ADG.− Looking at the

particular type of “diﬀerential equations”, that one can formulate, within the above

12

Anastasios Mallios

abstract framework, as this is advocated by ADG, we are able, in principle, to remark

here, yet, on the ground of a similar rationale, as before, that:

evolution may be perceived, as an “algebraic automorphism” (cf., for

instance, Feynman); that is, as something of a relational character (cf.

also Sorkin), which, in turn, can still supply an “analytic expression”.

(4.1)

So one can associate to it “numbers” (occasionally, in the most general

sense of the term; here one can think,

for instance, of something

reminding “(Gel’fand-)duality”, thus, e.g., even of a “generalized” (!)

spectrum of an appropriate operator, cf., for instance, in that connection,

Z. Daouldji-Malamou [5] or even [6], therefore, ﬁnally, through “diﬀer-

entiation” (Hamilton–Schr¨odinger), providing thus, yet, algebraically (!),

the “time operator” (Heisenberg–Prigogine–K¨ahler–Hiley).

In this connection, see also B.J. Hiley [14], as well as, A. Mallios [19: (3.27)]. Hence,

one thus arrives within the preceding framework, at the conclusion, that the

(4.2)

that:

(“diﬀerential”) equations acquire thus a “dynamical character”, more

akin to “second quantization”, in point of fact, to the “ﬁeld” itself, under

consideration, and not merely to the vector states in the carrier space of

a particular representation of CCR (: ﬁrst quantization); in this context,

the latter simply entails, in eﬀect, the “carrier space”, thus, in turn, the

supporting “space-time manifold” (alias, “continuum”), whose presence,

however, creates again, as already noted in the foregoing, ﬁnally, an,

indeed, fundamental problem for the whole set-up.

Consequently, as a really instrumental outcome of the preceding, one thus realizes

based on ADG, we are able to refer to the equations of quantum ﬁeld

theory, directly, in terms of the ﬁelds themselves; therefore, without the

(4.3)

intervention of any “background space”, which would provide, according

to the classical pattern (CDG), the “diﬀerential-geometric” apparatus,

employed in that framework.

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

13

The above constitutes, in eﬀect, as already noted before, the quintessence, indeed, of

the whole potential applicability of “ADG formalism” in problems of quantum ﬁeld

theory; let alone, of course, the fact that one is able, another upshot, as well, of the

general theory of ADG, as it was also pointed out in the preceding, to incorporate

(classical) “singularities” (: inﬁnities, and the like) in (the (local) sections of) the
structure sheaf A.

Therefore, equivalently, by referring to our previous last comments, one thus

concludes that;

(4.4)

(4.5)

the “ADG formalism” can read over (or even, see through) “singulari-

ties”, in the standard (: CDG) sense of the latter term.

Yet, in other words, one can say, by still applying a language, akin to quantum ﬁeld

theory (cf., for instance, R. Haag [13: p. 326]), that:

the “ADG formalism retains the information, one can (locally (!)) get,

even through (or else, (locally) supplied (!) by) “singularities”.

In this connection, see also, for example, A. Mallios-I. Raptis [26], concerning an

appropriate relevant formulation of the well-known “Finkelstein (coordinate) singu-

larities” [11]. Yet, see A. Mallios [19: (0.6) and subsequent comments therein], for

an early account of the same matter.

In toto, by summarizing the preceding, we can thus, ﬁnally, say that:

the “diﬀerential equations”, that one obtains, within the framework of

ADG, pertaining, thus directly to the ﬁeld itself, by virtue of the (as-

sumed) correspondences (3.3), hence, being, so to say, in character, “sec-

(4.6)

ond quantized ones”,

(4.6.1)

represent, in point of fact, the very quantized equation(s) of

the ﬁeld (viz. of the elementary particle), in focus.

In this connection, we can further remark that, the manner of understanding the

physis of elementary particles (thus, of the “fundamental entities”), by virtue of the

above correspondences (: identiﬁcations), as in (3.3) in the foregoing, may still be

construed, as being in accord with recent tendencies of taking into account “dynamic

individuation of fundamental entities” (see J. Stachel [34]). Now, in our case, as

14

(4.7)

(4.8)

Anastasios Mallios

above, this can, very likely, be assigned to the notion of the pair,

(E, D),

AutE

as the latter has been applied, throughout the preceding discussion (yet, cf. (3.3),

herewith), along with the concomitant invariance of the whole theory (: ADG),

under the action of the group

(group sheaf of A-automorphisms of E). Yet, the latter notion might be perceived,

in point of fact, within our present abstract perspective, actually supplied by the

ADG formalism, still (Klein) as a (“variant” (!)) “space-time” (see also A. Mallios

[19: (3.23) and (3.26)]).

Next, we specialize the preceding, straightforwardly, by the subsequent Section,

through concrete fundamental instances of the classical theory:

5. Concrete examples.− As already said, our aim in this ﬁnal Section of the

present article is to illuminate the preceding account, by referring, in particular, to

fundamental examples of the standard situation, thus far: Thus, we start with the

following Subsection.

5.(a). Einstein’s equation (in vacuo).− The (“diﬀerential”) equation, re-

ferred to in the title of this Subsection, has actually, just, the same form with the

homonymous one, as in the classical case (: CDG), however, now, quite a diﬀerent

meaning (!). We thus change point of view, as well as, the respective formalism, the

latter being now, that one of the abstract diﬀerential geometry (: ADG), in conjunc-

tion with our perspective, in that context, as exhibited by (3.3) in the preceding.

So the said equation has also herewith the familiar form,

(5.1)

Ric(E) = 0,

which thus in our case is the Einstein’s equation (in vacuo). Now, concerning the

technical part of the previous relation (5.1), we still refer to A. Mallios [18], or

even, for a full account thereof, to the forthcoming 2-volume detailed treatment

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

15

in A. Mallios [22: Chapt. IX; Section 3]. For convenience, however, of the ensuing

discussion, herewith, we do recall, in brief, the following items about (5.1); that is,

one thus sets:

(5.2)

Ric(E) = tr(R(·, s)t) ≡ tr(R(DE )(·, s)t) : E(U )−→A(U ),

where s, t are local (continuous) sections of the Yang-Mills ﬁeld concerned,

(5.3)

(E, D ≡ DE ),

in such a manner that the A(U )-morphism, as in (5.2) above, stands here for a “local
instance” (viz., by restriction to a local gauge U ⊆ X of E) of the so-called Ricci

operator of

(5.4)

(5.5)

such that one further deﬁnes;

E ≡ (E, DE ≡ D),

Ric(E) ≡ (RicU (E) ≡ Ric(E)),

with U running over a given local frame of E, the last relation yielding thus the
ﬁrst member of (the equation) (5.1), as an A-morphism (as it actually entails any
(“diﬀerential”) equation, whatsoever, cf. also (5.10) in the sequel) of the A-modules

(in fact, vector sheaves, see thus below) concerned, locally identiﬁed, through (5.2).
Now, the A-module E, as brieﬂy indicated by (5.4) above, that is involved here-

with, is, in point of fact, a “Lorentz vector sheaf ” (loc. cit., Chapt. IX; (2.14), or

even Note 3.1 therein) on a given topological space X, common base space, by def-
inition, of all the A-modules (sheaves) appeared throughout. Furthermore, within

this same context, one assumes an appropriate “diﬀerential triad” on X,

(5.6)

(5.7)

(A, ∂, Ω1

)

Ω1

= E ∗,

(see also Section 3 in the preceding for the relevant terminology applied here), while

we still suppose that, in particular, one has;

16

Anastasios Mallios

the second member of (5.7) standing for the “dual” vector sheaf of E (ibid. Chapt.

IX; Section 3, see, in particular, Deﬁnition 3.1, along with the subsequent Scholium

3.1 therein).

On the other hand, by further looking at (5.1), as above, we also remark that

any ﬁeld, that is (see thus (3.2), or even (3.3.1) in the foregoing), a pair, as in (5.3)

(but, see also (5.4), for an abbreviated form, of common usage too), that satisﬁes

(5.1), thus, in other words, a “solution of Einstein’s equation”, appears in the latter

equation, by itself, or even, precisely speaking, via its “ﬁeld strength” (: curvature),

(5.8)

R(DE ) ≡ R(D) ≡ R,

cf. thus (5.2) above.

Yet, in this regard, we should further remark that, based on the preceding (see

thus (3.3.1), or even (5.4)), and “dynamically speaking”, so to say, we also assume,

throughout the present discussion, the basic correspondence (: identiﬁcation),

(5.9)

ﬁeld ←→ DE ≡ D,

as it concerns, in eﬀect, a given pair (: a Yang-Mills ﬁeld), as in (5.4). However,
an A-connection D, as above, is, by its very deﬁnition (cf. (3.5) in the preceding),
only, a C-linear morphism, therefore, not a “tensor”, thus, technically speaking, not
an A-morphism of the A-modules concerned (ibid.), as it actually is, its curvature
(: ﬁeld strength), R(D) ≡ R, hence, the appearance of the latter in the corresponding

equations, describing the ﬁeld at issue: Indeed, something that we already hinted at

in the preceding (cf. thus the pertinent comments, following (5.5) above), we should

explicitly point out herewith the fundamental principle, in eﬀect, that,

the (“diﬀerential”) equations, describing a ﬁeld (yet, otherwise, by ob-

viously “abusing language” (!), herewith, the “equations of a ﬁeld”), are

(5.10)

to be formulated, via “tensors”; hence, in other words, in terms always
of A-morphisms, the equation itself entailing thus an A-morphism, as

well (expressing, by its very substance, for that matter, a physical law,

that one, determined by the “ﬁeld”, in focus).

In this connection, we can still say that the above may also be construed, as another

upshot of the same “principle of general covariance”; in this regard, see also, for

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

17

instance, D. Bleecker [3: p. 50, Section 3.3, in particular, p. 52, Theorem 3.3.6]. Yet,

within the same vein of ideas, we can further remark, in point of fact, that;

(5.11)

when considering the (“diﬀerential”) equations, describing ﬁelds (: na-
tural laws), as being A-morphisms (see (5.10) above), this may be con-

strued, in eﬀect, as another, just, technical (!), equivalent expression of

the same “principle of general covariance”.

On the other hand, by specializing our previous considerations in the preceding

Section 4 (cf., for instance, (4.6) therein) to the case of the equation (5.1), thus, by

further looking at the particular issues, involved in the same equation, one realizes

that;

Einstein’s equation (in vacuo) refers to the ﬁeld itself, that is, e o i p s o to

the respective quantum (hence, for the case at issue, to the “graviton”).

(5.12)

Therefore, it is, by its very formulation, already a quantized equation,

and, as a matter of fact, a “second quantized” one, therefore, an equation,

within the setting of quantum ﬁeld theory.

Indeed, the sheaf-theoretic character of the framework, within which that equation

has been formulated, provides also its relativistic perspective, being thus, at the same

time, as already remarked (see comments following (5.5)), a covariant one, as well.

On the other hand, by further continuing our concrete specialization of the pre-

ceding (see thus our general comments on “quantizing gravity” in Section 1, or even

(2.6) above) to the particular case, considered by the present Subsection, we can still

remark that, what is to be viewed, herewith, as of a particular signiﬁcance, especially

pertaining to problems of “quantum gravity”, being also in complete diversiﬁcation

with the manner we apply, in that context, the classical theory (: CDG), see, for

instance, (1.5), (1.9), or even (2.6) in the preceding, is the following fact, already

mentioned, generally speaking, in the foregoing. Namely, one can still remark here

that:

18

Anastasios Mallios

the whole formalism of ADG, according to its very deﬁnition,

(5.13.1)

is entirely “space-independent”,

in the usual sense of this term. That is, by applying herewith classical

parlance (loc. cit.),

(5.13.2)

one does not need any “background geometry to work with”,

(5.13)

while, at the same time, this same “geometry”, within the present ab-

stract set-up (: ADG), being, in point of fact, represented by (alias,
emanated from) the same “structure sheaf of coeﬃcients”, A (viz. our

“generalized arithmetics”),

(5.13.3)

is actually still varied with us (!), as well,

according to the very deﬁnition of the objects, that are entangled in the

equation, for instance, (5.1), as above. For,

(5.13.4)

“everything [there] boils down [locally (!)] to A”.

Yet, as a result of the preceding, we can still say that;

reﬂecting, within the framework of ADG, we realize that the “observer”

(5.14)

(viz. “we”, to the extent that this is expressed, trough our “arithme-
tics” A) becomes a “dynamical variable”, as well, acquiring thus too, a

“relativistic character”.

Thus, the following claim has here its relative position, being also in accord with

previous similar considerations; that is, one can say that

(5.15)

“all is dynamical” (!)

The above might also be related with J. Stachel’s, quite recently stated, principle of

dynamic individuation of the fundamental entities”, see thus [34: p. 32].

Now, by still commenting on our previous remark in (5.13.4), as above, we further

note that our last indication (“locally”) therein reminds us, of course, of a quite

recent comment of R. Haag [13: p. 326] in that,

“all information characterizing the [quantum ﬁeld] theory is strictly lo-

(5.16)

cal”,

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

19

this being also,

(5.17)

“the central message” of nowadays Quantum Field Theory (loc. cit.).

In this connection, it is further worth mentioning here that the same author, as above

(ibid.), refers to the aforesaid situation, about today QFT, while advocating a sheaf-

theoretic approach to that theory, as being thus more akin to the “local character”

of the latter (one thus considers here, neighborhoods), in contradistinction with

the “point-character” of ﬁber bundle theory, (e.g. vector bundles), that has been

employed, so far. On the other hand, by

(5.18)

applying ADG, one also gets, via its overall sheaf-theoretic character, at

a “synthesis of the knowledge gained in ... diﬀerent approaches”,

a fact, that was also in perspective, by the aforesaid author (loc. cit.). Thus, in the

case of ADG, one has, for instance, the following synthesis:

(5.19.1)

ADG ←→ CDG

(5.19)

in a new perspective, since no Calculus is employed, at all (!), plus

(5.19.2)

sheaf theory,

in conjunction with sheaf cohomology.

We terminate the present discussion, by still pointing out, within the preceding

framework, another, indeed, deﬁnitive aspect of the formalism of ADG, that we have

also hinted at in the foregoing, within the abstract setting of our general commentary

herein; namely, the

(5.20)

possibility of working, within the framework of ADG, by employing func-
tions, in point of fact, local sections of A, that may have/incorporate

a large, in eﬀect, the biggest, thus far (!), amount of “singularities”, in

the classical sense of this term, as if (a signiﬁcant, indeed, advantage of

the aforesaid mechanism) the latter classical anomalies of the standard

theory (CDG) were not present, at all (!)

Thus, to say it, once more, emphatically,

20

(5.21)

Anastasios Mallios

the formalism of ADG can, indeed “absorb” the “singularities” of the

classical theory,

by appropriately chosen A (see also (4.4), (4.5) in the preceding). In this connection

cf. A. Mallios-E.E. Rosinger [27], [28], for an early account of the subject, as well

as, the recent work in A. Mallios-I. Raptis [26]; yet, cf. A. Mallios [19], along with

A. Mallios [21: Chapt. IX; Subsection 5.(b)], concerning a more general perspective

thereon; yet, the latter can actually be viewed, as the outcome of some recent

categorical considerations, pertaining to the formalism of ADG, as presented in the

relevant work of M. Papatriantaﬁllou [31], [32].

5.(b). Yang-Mills equations.− As it was the case in the preceding with

Einstein’s equation (in vacuo), see equa. (5.1) above, the equations in the title of

the present Subsection, still retain, within the abstract set-up, employed herewith,

the familiar form, they have, in the standard setting of the classical theory (CDG).

Thus, the aforesaid equations preserve, here too, their classical form, within, of

course, the appropriate now formalism adapted to ADG. That is, one gets at the

relations;

(5.22)

or even, equivalently,

δEndE (R) = 0,

(5.23)

∆EndE (R) = 0,

which thus constitute, within the abstract setting of ADG, the corresponding Yang-

Mills equations.

Now, concerning the relevant technical details, connected with the previous equa-

tions, we still refer to A. Mallios [16], or even, for a complete account thereof, to

A. Mallios [21: Chapt. VIII]. For convenience, of course, we simply recall (loc. cit.),
that E here stands for a Yang-Mills ﬁeld, as in (5.3) above (cf. also, for instance,

(5.4)), whose ﬁeld strength is R (cf. (5.8)). Thus, here too, one realizes that;

a complete analogous rationale, as that one, we have exhibited above,

(5.24)

pertaining to Einstein’s equation (in vacuum), is also in force, referring

now to the Yang-Mills equations, as in (5.22)/(5.23).

Quantum gravity and “singularities”

21

In particular, see our previous remarks in (5.12), as well as, in (5.13), being, in

that context, of a special signiﬁcance, from a quantum relativistic point of view,

in connection with nowadays aspects on the matter, as this was explained in the

previous Subsection 5.(a), concerning, in particular, therein, Einstein’s equation

(in vacuo). Yet, in this connection, cf. also, for instance, the relevant critique of

P.G. Bergmann [2], pertaining, in particular, to an appropriate “physicalization of

geometry” (!), the latter perspective being, in point of fact, quite akin to the abstract

point of view, that has been also advocated, by the present study, as another potential

application of ADG (see also [22]).

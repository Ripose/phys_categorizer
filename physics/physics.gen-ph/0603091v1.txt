Abstract

According to the theory of relativity, the 4-vector force
acting on a particle is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity
of the particle, but we found that the electromagnetic force
of the Maxwell’s theory can not completely satisfy this
orthogonality, this incompletion leads us to ﬁnd that the
electromagnetic force has two independent components in the
4 dimensional space time. A 4-vector force has 4 components,
because of the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector
velocity, the number of independent components of the force
reduces to 3, while the electromagnetic force can merely
provide 2 independent components, this situation means
that there is an undeﬁned component accompanying the
electromagnetic force. This missing undeﬁned component
may serve as a hidden variable which quantum mechanics
is eager to ﬁnd for a long time. The primary purpose
of this paper is to strictly proof that the electromagnetic
force has two independent components in the 4 dimensional
space time. We also brieﬂy discuss the possibility that the
undeﬁned component of the electromagnetic force serves as
a hidden variable for quantum mechanics.

Introduction

In the theory of relativity, the 4-vector force acting on
a particle is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the
particle, because the magnitude of the 4-vector velocity
u keeps constant[1] as

= √uµuµ =

u

−

p

c2 = ic

(1)

Any force acting on the particle can never change u
in the magnitude but change u in the direction, thus
the 4-vector force is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity.
Strictly, the prooﬁng of the orthogonality is given by

uµfµ = uµm

duµ
dτ

=

m
2

d(uµuµ)
dτ

= 0

The orthogonality does not depend upon any property
of 4 vector force, holds for any kinds of forces. Where
the frame of reference is a Cartesian coordinate system
whose axes are orthogonal to one another, there is no
distinction between covariant and contravariant compo-
nents, only subscripts need to be used, m denotes the
mass of the particle, the 4 dimensional space time refers
to (x1, x2, x3, x4 = ict), the index µ takes over 1, 2, 3, 4.
We found that the electromagnetic force of the
Maxwell’s theory can not completely satisfy this orthogo-
nality, this incompletion leads us to ﬁnd that the electro-
magnetic force has two independent components in the
4 dimensional space time. A 4-vector force has 4 compo-
nents, because of the orthogonality of 4-vector force and
4-vector velocity, the number of independent components
of the force reduces to 3, while the electromagnetic force
can merely provide 2 independent components, this situa-
tion means that there is an undeﬁned component accom-
panying the electromagnetic force — does this missing
undeﬁned component is a hidden variable ?— quantum
mechanics is eager to ﬁnd it for a long time.

The primary purpose of this paper is to strictly proof
that the electromagnetic force has two independent com-
ponents in the 4 dimensional space time. We also brieﬂy
discuss the possibility that the undeﬁned component of
the electromagnetic force serves as a hidden variable for
quantum mechanics.

4-vector Coulomb’s force

Suppose there are two charged particle q and q′ locating
at the positions x and x′ respectively in a Cartesian co-
ordinate system S, and moving at the 4-vector velocities
u and u′respectively, as shown in Fig.1, where we have
used X to denote x
x′. The Coulomb’s force f acting
on the particle q is orthogonal to the velocity direction of

to represent the complex space-time, like a centripetal
force, the force f would likely make an attempt to rotate
itself about the particle’s path center, we think that the
path center, q, q′ and the force f all should be in the
plane of u′ and X, so that we make an expansion to f as

tential for a moving particle.

2.4

The completion of the electromag-
netic force’s basis vectors

The above formalism clearly shows that the Maxwell’s
equations can be derived from the classical Coulomb’s
force and the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector
velocity. In other words, the orthogonality is hidden in
the Maxwell’s equation. Specially, Eq.(5) directly ac-
counts for the geometrical meanings of the curl of vector
potential, the curl contains the orthogonality. The or-
thogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity is one
of consequences from the relativistic mechanics[2].

But, whether the expansion we have used in Eq.(3) is
complete? Obviously, we choose two basis vector u′ and
X to construct the electromagnetism successfully, this
choice means that the electromagnetic force has two in-
dependent components in its Hilbert space based on the
two basis vector u′ and X, we readily recognize that the
expansion is incomplete. A 4-vector force has 4 compo-
nents, because of the orthogonality of 4-vecor force and
4-vector velocity, the number of independent components
of the force reduces to 3, thus a complete expansion of a
4-vector force needs 3 basis vectors.

Our argument also arises from that if the electromag-
netic force of the Maxwell’s theory has two independent
components, then there is an undeﬁned component ac-
companying the Maxwell’s electromagnetic force. This
missing undeﬁned component may serve a hidden vari-
able for quantum mechanics.
In the next sections, we
will strictly and comprehensively proof that the electro-
magnetic force of the Maxwell’s theory does have two
independent components, does have an undeﬁned com-
ponent in the physics. In order to clarify its aspects as
much as possible, we present four methods to proof the
theme.

In usual 3D space, the vector product of two vector a
b,
and b is deﬁned as another vector c given by c = a
or ck = εkij aibj, where the indexes i, j and k take over
1, 2, 3 in the 3D space, εkij deﬁned in usual textbooks; as
we know,the vector c is orthogonal to both the vectors
a and b, i.e. c
In the Minkowski’s
space, we also intruduce a deﬁnition for vector product:
as shown in Fig.1, imaging that there is a 4-vector Γ
which is orthogonal to the plain of u′ and X, then Γ is
deﬁned by the vector product as

a and c

b.

Γλ = ελµνu′µXν

orthogonalities Γ

(22)

(23)

Γ

u′ = 0

·

·

The vector Γ can be easily imaged out intuitively in Fig.1.
The electromagnetic 4-vector force has 4 components, it
subjects to the ﬁrst constraint given by

·
the second constraint on the 4-vector force is given by

f

u = 0

(24)

f

Γ = (Au′ + BX)

Γ = 0

(25)

·

·

The ﬁrst constraint is just the orthogonality of 4-vector
force and 4-vector velocity, the second constraint reﬂects
our choice that the electromagnetic force lies in the plain
of u′ and X to which the vector Γ is orthogonal. Subject-
ing to these two constraints, the number of independent
components of the electromagnetic force reduces to 2.
The two independent components allow the electromag-
netic force to change in the plain of u′ and X.

3.2

the second proof — in its Hilbert

space

The moving particle q′ exerts an electromagnetic force f
on another moving particle q, the action has been sophis-
ticatedly expressed as

fµ = qFµν uν = quν∂µAν −

quν∂ν Aµ

(26)

3

To note that in the present stage of human’s knowl-
edge, the above each term can not be resolved into more
details, therefore, we conclude that the electromagnetic
force contains two terms, each term represents a basis
vector of its Hilbert space, the number of independent
components of the electromagnetic force is 2.

This provides an insight into electromagnetism that
a full electromagnetic force should contain at least tree
terms in its formalism.

3.3

the third proof — hydrogen atom as
an instance

The nucleus of a hydrogen atom provides a spherical
Coulomb’s electric potential for its outer electron, this 4-
vector force subjects to the ﬁrst and second constraints,
given by

u = 0
r = 0

f
f

·
×

(27)
(28)

·

the second constraint expresses that the torque of the
centripetal force is zero, and it arises from the above
Γ = 0 for this instance (Γ parallels to X).
mentioned f
Since the torque is zero, the angular momentum vector
keeps a constant vector, so that the electron moves in
a plane (e.g., in the x-y plane with the normal axis z),
this analysis imposes the third constraint on the 4-vector
force

fz = 0

(29)

Thus the 4-vector force has one independent component,
usually with a basis vector along r in the x-y-z space in
the form of spheric centripetal force. In other words, if
f = fx +fy, because of the spheric symmetry, there is only
one independent component between fx and fy. You can
see, if we consider the ﬁrst two constraints, then the 4-
force in hydrogen atom has two independent components,
actually we involves the third constaint, then the number
of independent components of the 4-vector force reduces
to 1.

3.4

the fourth proof — outside the elec-
tromagnetism

A 4-vector force has 4 components, because of the or-
thogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity, the
number of independent components reduces to 3, while
the electromagnetic force can merely provide 2 inde-
pendent components, this situation means that there is
an undeﬁned component accompanying the electromag-
netic force. what is the eﬀect of the electromagnetism-
undeﬁned-component (EUC) in the physics? Outside
the electromagnetism, a variety of problems may concern
with the EUC, for example, quantum mechanics is eager
to ﬁnd a hidden variable for a long time for which the

EUC may serve. Since its complex, we put the fourth
proof in the next section, where we choose and brieﬂy
discuss three basic questions: (1) the properties of the
EUC; (2) wave function and 4-vector velocity ﬁeld in the
EUC ensemble space; (3) a successful application to hy-
drogen’s ﬁne structure.

4 The proof outside the electro-

magnetism

4.1

the properties of the electromag-
netism undeﬁned component (EUC)

The properties of the EUC include : (1) EUC is a small
quantity which is hardly noted by physicists, if it serves as
a hidden variable for quantum mechanics, then it should
be responsible to the Planck’s constant; (2) EUC is a
ﬂuctuating quantity in the ensemble space of enormous
identical experiments, its average value at a given point
must be zero, like < fEUC >= 0; (3)as a nature of in-
dependency, EUC must be independent from our elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, for example, in a vacuum when any
our electromagnetic ﬁeld has vanished oﬀ its mater en-
vironment, while the EUC can still alive in the vacuum
and cause the indeterminacy of the motion of particles
moving in the vacuum; (4)EUC also correlates with our
electromagnetic ﬁeld through the orthogonality f
u = 0;
(5) The eﬀect of EUC on physics must be comprehensive,
it is not concern with individual cases, no body can re-
ally escape from its ﬂuctuation if the EUC still remains
at undeﬁned status.

·

According to the above mentioned properties of EUC,
the proof outside the electromagnetism will carry out on
”the path” that leads us from the EUC to the two key
points of quantum mechanics: wave function and hydro-
gen atom.

4.2 wave function and 4-vector velocity

ﬁeld in ensemble space

Consider a particle diﬀraction experiment in an electro-
magnetic ﬁeld where the EUC is active and cause the
indeterminacy of quantum mechanics, Each particle in
the ﬁeld subjects to both the electromagnetic force f and
EUC fEUC , then it satisﬁes the dynamic equation:

m

duµ
dτ

uµuµ =

c2

−

= fµ + fEUCµ = qFµν uν + fEUCµ (30)

(31)

In order to eliminate the EUC term by means of statis-
tics, i.e. using < fEUC >= 0, we turn to study this
dynamic equation in the ensemble space which consists

4

of enormous particle paths recorded in enormous identi-
cal experiments, in the ensemble space we ﬁnd

m

d < uµ >
dτ
< uµ >< uµ > =

c2

−

= qFµν < uν >

(32)

(33)

Strictly speaking, Eq.(33) is not derived from Eq.(31),
it stands for the property that the magnitude of any
4-vector velocity keeps constant, otherwise this velocity
concept collapses. If we regard the enormous recorded
particle paths in the ensemble space as a ﬂow, it is easy
to ﬁnd that there a 4-vector velocity ﬁeld for the ﬂow.
We clearly emphasize two points:(1) At every point of the
ensemble space, the mean 4-vector velocity satisﬁes the
above mean dynamic equation; (2) the mean 4-velocity
is a 4-vector velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂow, < u > is a function
of the position of the ensemble space, i.e. in the form of
< u > (x1, x2, x3, x4).

For our convenience, we drop the mean sign <> for
the 4-vector velocity u in the followings, simply use u
in palce of < u >. As mentioned above, the 4-vector
velocity u can be regarded as a 4-vector velocity ﬁeld in
the ensemble space, then

Beware: Eq.(34) is the most important step in the
present work after inducing the concept of 4-vector veloc-
ity ﬁeld in ensemble space. Substituting them back into
the dynamic equation, and re-arranging these terms, we
obtain

uν∂ν (muµ + qAµ) = uν∂µ(qAν )

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν )

mentum itself, does not correspond to the product of
momentum operator and momentum operator.

In this subsection, by using the < fEUC >= 0 con-
cept and 4-vector velocity ﬁeld in ensemble space, we
construct a relation between wave function and particle
momentum, as we know, the relation has been widely
used in quantum mechanics.

an application to hydrogen atom’s

ﬁne structure

In the following, we use the Gaussian units, and use me
to denote the rest mass of electron. In a spherical po-
lar coordinate system (r, θ, ϕ, ict), the nucleus of a hy-
drogen atom provides a spherically symmetric potential
V (r) = e/r for the electron motion. The wave equa-
tion (42) for the hydrogen atom in the energy eigenstate

After we introduce the EUC into quantum mechanics,
the quantum mechanics becomes reasonable at its key
points, we think that we have indirectly proofed the ex-
istence of the EUC outside the electromagnetism, and the
electromagnetic force of the Maxwell’s theory has two in-
dependent components in the 4 dimensional space-time.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we proof that the electromagnetic force of
the Maxwell’s theory has two independent components in
the 4 dimensional space time. A 4-vector force has 4 com-
ponents, because of the orthogonality of 4-vector force
and 4-vector velocity, the number of independent compo-
nents of the force reduces to 3, while the electromagnetic
force can merely provide 2 independent components, this
situation means that there is an undeﬁned component
accompanying the electromagnetic force. Therefore, we
also brieﬂy and conﬁrmedly discuss the possibility that
the undeﬁned component of the electromagnetic force
serves as a hidden variable for quantum mechanics.

Abstract

In this note we observe that Webb and co-workers’ observation of
an evolving ﬁne structure constant has since been reconﬁrmed. We
also conﬁrm Kuhne’s contention that this implies a cosmological con-
stant and exhibit a cosmological mechanism for Webb’s result. We
also see how this provides a mechanism to reach elementary particle
scales from the Quantum Superstring scale.

Kuhne[1] suggested sometime ago that the then preliminary results of Web
et al[2] that there was a slow cosmic evolution of the ﬁne struture constant
α, could be explained in terms of a cosmology with a cosmological constant.
Since then Web and co-workers have reconﬁrmed their initial observations[3],
and the acceleration of the universe, implying a cosmological constant has
also been repeatedly conﬁrmed[4]. In this note we conﬁrm Kuhne’s conclusion
and provide a mechanism for the variation of α.
Kuhne derives the following equation,

(1)

from a well known equation of Teller, where H is the Hubble constant, z
denotes the value of the parameterr at the cosmological redshift z and the

to exhibit the cosmological constant.
We consider the above results in the light of ﬂuctuational cosmology[5, 6, 7].
In this cosmology, √N particles are ﬂuctuationally created, somewhat on
the lines suggested by Hayakawa[8, 9]-and this happens within the minimum
unphysical time interval, the Compton time τ . Such a cosmology is not
only consistent with observation, but it also deduces from the theory the
otherwise empirical Large Number Relations of Dirac as also the mysterious
empirical Weinberg relation between the pion mass and the Hubble Constant.
The cosmology also predicted an ever expanding and accelerating universe,
as indeed was discovered shortly thereafter and reconﬁrmed since (Cf. also
[10]). In this cosmological scheme, the cosmological constant Λ is given by,

In what follows, equalities are approximate equalities in the order of magni-
tude sense. We now observe that substitution of (3) in (1) gives

where β <
It can immediately be seen that (4) is compatible with (2).
We ﬁnally give the derivation of (2) in the above context wherein, as the
number of particles in the universe increases with time, we go from the Planck
scale to the Compton scale. It is known that this Compton length, due to
Zitterbewegung causes a correction to the electrostatic potential which an
orbiting electron experiences, rather like the Darwin term[11].
Infact we have

where ∆α is the change in the ﬁne structure constant from the early uni-
verse. (6) is an equivalent form of (2) (Cf.ref.[1]), and is the result originally
obtained by Webb et al (Cf.refs.[2, 3]).
We now consider brieﬂy Quantum Superstrings.
One of the criticisms levelled against Quantum Superstrings (QSS) Theory
is that it is not veriﬁable, as it deals with Planck scale phenomena. Indeed ’t
Hooft has gone so far as to say that it is not even a theory[12]. The question
is, are there any eﬀects which can be observed at scales corresponding to
elementary particles? For example could we go from QSS to the Compton
scale? We will now discuss brieﬂy, exactly such a mechanism.
As is well known, at the scale of QSS we have a non commutative geometry
[13, 14],

[x, y]

≈

0(l2), [x, px] = ¯h[1 + 0(l2)]etc.

Another way of looking at (7) is that there is a generalised Uncertainity
Principle in operation at this scale ([15] - [20])

lp being the Planck length.
The ﬁrst term on the right side of equation (8) gives the usual Uncertainity
relation, while the second term represents the duality eﬀect - as we go down
to the Planck scale we infact are lead to the larger scale represented by the
second term (Cf.ref.[15, 21, 22]).
Before proceeding further, it may be remarked that the non commutativee
geometry in (7) is a manifestation of the non zero spatial extension of the
strings[23].
We now come to a mechanism by which the Compton scale arises quite
naturally in the above context. As was pointed out a long time ago by
Hayakawa[24], the ﬂuctuation in the mass of a typical elementary particle
1080
due to the ﬂuctuation of the particle number, which is

√N, N

being the number of elementary particles in the universe, is given by

Using now the Uncertainity Principle, we get,

(∆mc2)T =

G√Nm2
R

T =

G√Nm2
c

T being the age of the universe and R its radius which equals cT . It can be
easily seen that the right side of (9) equals ¯h! That is, we have,

(9)

(10)

Equation (10) immediately gives us the Compton wavelength. Interestingly a
similar line of reasoning leads to a ﬂuctuational model of cosmology, which ex-
plains the many so called Large Number coincidences as also Weinberg’s ap-
parently mysterious empirical relation between the pion mass and the Hubble
Constant, from theory, and moreover predicts an ever expanding accelerating
universe, as indeed has been repeatedly veriﬁed in the past few years[25, 26].

We now observe that n
√n of Planck scale particles. Then the second term
secondary ﬂuctuation
of (8) gives

mp being the Planck mass. The right side of (11) is precisely the Compton
wavelength lπ of a typical elementary particle, viz., the pion. Immediately
we recover therefrom two other consistent relations for the mass of the pion
and its Compton time viz.,

= lp√n,

(11)

As mentioned after (8), this is the well known duality eﬀect - as we go down
to the Planck scale, we end up at the Compton scale.
Thus the QSS scale and the Compton scale are related by the duality relation.
We ﬁnally make the following remark. In the light of the above considerations

mπ =

leading to (9) and (11), it is interesting that we can consider the energy of
a Planck mass to be the gravitational energy of the ﬂuctuational √n Planck
masses within the Compton length lπ. That is, we should have,

G√nm2

This is indeed so.

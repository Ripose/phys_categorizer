Abstract

In this paper we consider the well-known cyclical model for climate
change ,for example from glaciation to the present day and back, and
compare this with a two-state model in Quantum Mechanics.We es-
tablish the full correspondence.

1 Introduction

In the Northern Hemisphere,the last glaciation took place 18,000 years ago.[1]
The ice layer was several kilometers thick.It covered up to the middle of US
and Europe and right up to Paris.Infact the current situation is one in which
the continental ice extends only up to Greenland and this was established
10,000 years ago.That is, the earth has in a few thousand years undergone a
tremendous transition between two completely diﬀerent states in a very short
span of time– geologically speaking. The earth can be seen as a point object
in space receiving solar radiation and emitting infra-red radiation back into
space.We consider the only important state variable,the mean temperature
T,with respect to time given by the heat balance equation

solar radiation emitted back into space. The equation (1) admits two steady
states Ta,Tb, Ta, being the present day climate and Tb, the glaciation time.
A third state T0 is unstable and separates the above two stable states. As is
well known,in systems involving only one variable,U the kinetic potential is
given by [2]

U = −

Z

dxF (x)

In the present case, the kinetic potential U(T) is given by

U(T ) = − 1

C Z

dT (Q(1 − a(T )) − ǫBσT 4)

Now climatic systems like any other physical system are continuously subject
to statistical ﬂuctuations,the random deviation from deterministic behavior.
We include the eﬀect of the ﬂuctuations in a random force F(t).The energy
balance equation ,(1),and (2) now become a stochastic diﬀerential equation
of the form

dT
dt

= −∂U(T )

∂T

+ F (T )

The important new element introduced by this enlarged description is that
diﬀerent states become connected through the ﬂuctuation.That is ,start-
ing from some initial state the system will reach any other state,sooner or
later.This is true for the stable states Ta and Tb ,taken as initial states,which
become some sort of meta-stable states.
The time scale of this phenomenon is determined by two factors:the potential
barrier

∆Ua,b = U(T0) − U(Ta,b)

and the strength of the ﬂuctuations as measured by the variance ,q2 of F(t)in
(3).
The mean transition time from state Ta or Tb via the unstable state T0 is
given by [1]

2 The Model

We will now model the above situation in terms of a Quantum Mechanical
two state system.In the Quantum Mechanical world a two state system[3]
could be represented by the equations

i¯h

i¯h

dC1
dt

dC2
dt

= H11C1 + H12C2

= H21C1 + H22C2

where the coeﬃcients Hij are the Hamiltonian matrix and C is given by the
vector,

We now identify C with T and its two states Ta and Tb and write

C ≡ (C1, C2)

C ≡ (C1, C2) ≡ (Ta, Tb) ≡ T

This reduces (5) to

i¯h

dT
dt

= HT

dT
d¯t

= HT

where H is the 2x2 matrix. Taking ¯t = t

i¯h reduces (6) to

Reverting back to equation(3) and replacing t with T we have

dT
dt

= −∂U(T )

∂t

+ F (t)

Taking

−∂U(T )
∂t

dT
dt

= HT

+ F (t) = H(T ), we get

(8) is identical to (7).We note that from Quantum Mechanical Theory,

To proceed further and establish the correspondence fully,we now observe
H12=H21 is proportional to the transition probability of C1 to C2 i e., Ta to
Tb In fact[4]

So the transition time in Quantum Theory is given by

∆t

H12 α e−U/kT

(10) can be identiﬁed with equation (4). This establishes the required result.
The reduction of the Climate problem to the analogous Quantum Mechanical
problem has interesting consequences which need to be studied further.This
is all the more so because in recent years “Scaled” Quantum eﬀects have
been studied in macroscopic systems and even a Bode-Titius type relation
for planetary distances has been deduced on the basis of “quantized” energy
levels.[5, 6, 7, 8]

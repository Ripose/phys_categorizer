Abstract

Pathria(1972) has shown, for a pressureless closed Universe, that it is inside a black (or white)

hole. We show now, that the Universe with a cosmic pressure obeying Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, can

be inside a white-hole. In the closed case, a positive cosmological constant does the job; for the ﬂat

and open cases, the condition we ﬁnd is not veriﬁed for the very early Universe, but with the growth

of the scale-factor, the condition will be certainly fulﬁlled for a positive cosmological constant, after

sometime. We associate the absolute temperature of the Universe, with the temperature of the

corresponding white-hole.

IS THE UNIVERSE A WHITE-HOLE?

Marcelo Samuel Berman

I. Introduction

The contents of this paper, submitted ﬁrst in 24 May, 2006, to a journal, is based on

a method published by Gomide and Berman(1987); we are not sure that since 1987, the

present calculation has not been published by someone else. Because the referee for this

paper has not decided yet on its acceptance, or not, we publish it in the web right now.

Pathria(1972) published a paper showing that, for certain values of the cosmological

constant, a pressureless ﬁnite (positively curved) Universe could be inside a white-hole, if it

We study below, all three tricurvature cases ( k = 0,

1 ). We also treat the absolute

temperature of black holes and the Universe.

Berman(2006;2006a) has studied the same subject by means of Mach’s Principle, and the

hypothesis of a zero-total-energy for the Universe.

II. Closed Universe as a White-hole

Considering a positive cosmological constant (Λ > 0), and remembering that the volume

V , for a closed Robertson-Walker’s Universe, is given by(Adler, Bazin and Schiﬀer, 1975):

V = 2π2R3

we ﬁnd,

ρ = M

From equation(5) we ﬁnd:

If Λ > 0 , and because

As the scale-factor is essentially positive, condition (12) will be certainly fulﬁlled by the

We have shown that a closed Universe, while cosmic pressure p follows Einstein’s ﬁeld

equation (6) normally, shall be inside a white-hole, if Λ > 0 .

We shall now apply Einstein’s ﬁeld equations for k = 0 . With the prescription:

We remark that this condition is equivalent to ”closing” the Universe, in what respects

the density ﬁeld equation (but not in terms of the pressure equation). Even if this condition

may not prevail for the very early Universe, nevertheless, with increasing values of the

scale-factor, eventually the condition (16) shall be fulﬁlled.

IV. Absolute temperature in Cosmology and White-holes

Hawking(2001), cites the formula he obtained many years ago, for the absolute temper-

ature T associated with a non rotating and non charged black-hole; though in our paper

we are dealing with Classical Physics, and Hawking’s formula is based on Quantum theory,

it will be seen that we can make a bridge with Classical Cosmology:

If Brans-Dicke relation is taken, in such a way that R

(18)

This is exactly what we ﬁnd in standard Cosmology, between the scale factor R(t) and

T . This is a most striking analogy that points out to a possible white-hole Universe. [See

however, Berman(2006 b), where it is studied the Machian case R

T −2 ].

V. Open Universe as a white-hole

We shall leave, once more, the cosmic pressure to obey freely Einstein’s ﬁeld equations.

From the energy density ρ – equation (5), with k =

1 , we have, then,

where we suppose, quite generally, that the tridimensional volume is given by:

V = αR−3

( α = positive constant )

.

(20)

The condition for the open Universe to be or become a white-hole, is given by r > R ,

so that,

Λ > hm

We conclude that the condition (21) can be staten as,

At least, we can impose the following suﬃcient condition:

because

By the same token as in last paragraph of Section III above, for the expanding Universe,

when the scale factor becomes larger than q

Λ we shall have a white-hole-Universe.

We remark that condition (24) is identical with (16), which refers to a ﬂat Robertson-

Walker’s metric.

VI. Conclusions

We have shown, in a diﬀerent context than in Pathria’s paper (where p = 0), that the

closed Robertson-Walker’s Universe, with any value of p constrained to obey Einstein’s ﬁeld

equations may be thought as being a white-hole; the Brans-Dicke relation to the problem

was also taken care: this is a Machian condition for the Universe. In a similar way, ﬂat or

open Universes, in the expanding phase, may become white-holes after R becoming larger

Λ . Finally, we motivate the analogy between the Universe and a white-hole, by
than q
means of their absolute temperatures. However, the Machian condition for the Universe,

was taken, partially, as implying that the absolute temperature ran like (cid:16)
this dependence, or the standard R−1 one, were dealt elsewhere (Berman, 2006 b) .

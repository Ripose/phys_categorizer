We consider quantum systems which interact strongly with a rapidly varying environment and
derive a Schr¨odinger-like equation which describes the time evolution of the average wave function.
We show that the corresponding Hamiltonian can be taken to be Hermitian provided all states
are rotated using an appropriate unitary transformation. The formalism is applied to a variety of
systems and is compared and contrasted with related results describing stochastic resonances.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of quantum systems which interact strongly with their environment often presents serious challenges
due to the possibility that these interactions cannot be neglected and, in addition, also vary rapidly and randomly
with time [1]. The eﬀects of such external ﬁelds is often unavoidable and interesting and can lead to unexpected
phenomena such as, for example, those studied under the blanket term of stochastic resonances [2]. In this paper we
will study one subset of such systems.

We will assume that the interactions with the environment are described by a time-dependent contribution to the
Hamiltonian denoted by H ′(t) which cannot be treated perturbatively. In analogy with a similar problem in mechan-
ics [3] we will assume self-consistently that the states of the system can be decomposed into a sum of slowly varying
modes and high-frequency components of small amplitude. Using this decomposition we will show that the time
evolution of the slow modes is determined by an eﬀective Hamiltonian which, to leading order, depends quadratically
on the external interaction H ′. The formalism assumes that the time scales associated with the interactions with the
environment are much shorter than all other frequencies in the problem. Denoting by Ω a typical frequency of the
interaction H ′, we will obtain a solution to Schr¨odinger’s equation as a series in 1/Ω.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian describes the average time evolution of the system and can exhibit resonances under
some special circumstances which will be illustrated using simple examples. It is also worth noting that the same
formalism can be applied to any system evolving according to a Schr¨odinger-like equation assuming that the operators
corresponding to the Hamiltonian contain terms which vary rapidly in the evolution parameter. We also provide
examples of this type of generalization: using geometrical optics we study light-ray propagation in a random media,
and, we determine the eﬀects of a time-independent potential which varies rapidly with position on the wave functions
of a non-relativistic particle.

The paper is organized as follows: in section II we give a description of the formalism and ﬁnd the eﬀective Hamil-
tonian that will be used in the applications. The behavior of the eﬀective Hamiltonian under unitary transformations
is studied in section III; the formalism is then applied to various illustrative examples in section IV. In section V we
give an alternative view of the problem in terms of the Fokker-Planck equation and the results are then compared and
contrasted with the formalism used in deriving the standard stochastic resonances (section VI). Paring comments
and conclusions are presented in section VII. Finally, a mathematical detail is relegated to the appendix.

II. QUANTUM SYSTEMS WITH RAPIDLY-VARYING EXTERNAL FIELDS

We consider a generic quantum system with a Hamiltonian of the form

H = H0 + H ′,

(1)

where H ′ is time dependent with characteristic frequencies assumed larger than all the other energy scales in the
system (we take units where ¯h = 1). In general we will also allow H0 to vary with time, but with the restriction
that the time scale(s) associated with H0 are much smaller than those associated with the time variation of H ′. In
addition we assume that H ′ is larger than H0 so that, symbolically

1

More speciﬁcally we assume that H ′ admits a Fourier expansion of the type

H0,

˙H0/H0 < H ′ < ˙H ′/H ′.

H ′ =

Hωe−iωt,

X|ω|>Ω

Ω. In general we will
where the sum is over a set of frequencies
allow the Fourier coeﬃcients Hω to be time-dependent, but, as for H0, we assume that the corresponding frequencies
are small compared to Ω. Henceforth “slow” will mean “of frequency

Since ψ is slowly varying, the ﬁrst equation can be solved to this order in η by taking ψ constant, namely,

whence

HΨ = i ˙Ψ,

i ˙ψ + i ˙χ1 + O(Ωη2) = H0ψ + H ′ψ + O(H0η, Ωη2),

there is some probability “leakage” of order η2 from the slowly varying part of the wave function to the rapidly varying

The non-Hermiticity of the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the slowly varying modes frequently appears in expansions
similar to the one considered here [5] 1. This result can be better understood by considering the behavior of the above
expansion under unitary transformations to which we now turn.

III. UNITARY TRANSFORMATIONS

In this section we determine the behavior of the eﬀective Hamiltonian (16) under unitary transformations. We show
below that the non-Hermitian piece in (16) is modiﬁed under such transformations and, in fact, can be completely
eliminated.

For the case of a constant transformation, Ψ

1In [5] a non-Hermitian term was found already in the ﬁrst order, the discrepancy between this result and the one obtained

leading to diﬀerent expansion parameters.

ψ + O(η3),

The O(η2) diﬀerence between ψ and ˆψ quantiﬁes the probability leak into the rapidly varying sector for the original
frame. The second order term in the wave function ˆχ2 cannot be determined without a speciﬁc choice for the O(η2)
terms in F . The speciﬁc form of the relation between ˆψ and ψ can also be understood form the expression for the
non-Hermitian part of the eﬀective Hamiltonian obtained in (17).

We conjecture that this procedure can be carried order-by-order in η, but since we will not need these higher order
corrections we will not pursue this further. The expression (22) is the form of the eﬀective Hamiltonian which will be
used in the following examples.

The previous results can be applied to a variety of systems. In this section we will consider 5 such examples. Our

main concern will be to illustrate a wide range of systems that can be studied using the above formalism

In this section we consider a quantum system with a ﬁnite number of states. This serves, for example, as a model
for spin or ﬂavor changes in elementary particles; it also describes the basic physics of nuclear magnetic resonance
and related phenomena. The most general Hamiltonian for these systems can be expanded in terms of the generators
of SU (N ) which we denote by

In ﬁg. 1 we also compare the results obtained using the eﬀective Hamiltonian (28) to those obtained solving the
Schr¨odinger equation exactly with initial conditions Ψ(t = 0) = ψ(t = 0) = 1. It can be seen that the solutions
obtained using Heﬀ do indeed describe the average behavior of the wave-function provided η is suﬃciently small. We
conclude that, at least for the case of a 2-level system, the eﬀective Hamiltonian (22) accurately describes the average
evolution of the system.

The presence of noise (i.e., H ′) can then generate unexpected resonances. The condition for these to occur is,

C. Geometrical Optics example

The calculations in the previous sections referred to quantum systems, but it clear that any system whose dynamical
equations can be cast into a Schr¨odinger-like form can be treated in the same way. In particular for this general case
there is no need to require H to be a Hermitian operator.

An example of this situation is provided by the description of light-ray evolution within geometrical optics [9]. For
small angles the position and direction of light ray within geometrical optics can be described using a two-component
vector

(cid:19)
where h denotes the height with respect to a reference line and α the tilt (assumed to be small). Any transformation
of a light ray can be described using a 2

The eﬀective operator which determines the translation over a ﬁnite distance X is then (assuming for simplicity

that K is position independent)

(the K 2 < 0 case is obtained by analytic continuation). This matrix is equivalent to a thick symmetric lens with
radius of curvature ¯R and thickness ¯d such that

characteristics. For example, using a thick lens with a high index of refraction, ¯n

D. The noisy Jaynes-Cummings model

In this example we consider a simpliﬁed version of an atom interacting with a photon ﬁeld, as described by the
Jaynes-Cummings model [10], with the addition of two types of interaction with an external rapidly varying ﬁelds.
We will show that this problem is also well suited for study using the techniques introduced above. We ﬁrst assume
that the external ﬁeld are coupled to the photons, and then directly to the atoms. We then show that both situations
are unitarily equivalent.

The unperturbed Hamiltonian for this model is

Non-trivial terms may arise at higher orders but this would require calculating the (Hermitian version of the) eﬀective
Hamiltonian to order η3. Instead of following this uninspiring approach we consider a diﬀerent way of introducing the
interaction with the external ﬁelds and then show that the corresponding eﬀective operator corresponds to the order
η3 contribution generated by (53). To this end we ﬁrst consider a unitary transformation of the form

The eﬀects of the external sources is, to lowest order, summarized by the simple shift (59) which corresponds to a
change in the energy gap between the two spin states of the “atom” of this model. In particular, for noise of suﬃciently
large amplitude, we can have ǫeﬀ = ω0/2 in which case the Rabi frequency vanishes, En+ = En− and photon number
is conserved.

There are, of course, diﬀerences between the solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation associated with (81) and the
solutions derived from (78). The quantities Ga used in obtaining (78) are assumed to be stochastic variables whose

In concluding this section we note that it is possible to generate the required correlation between g1 and g2 by

VI. COMPARISON WITH THE STANDARD STOCHASTIC RESONANCES

The resonances described above are reminiscent of the well-studied stochastic resonances [2] that are characterized
by an increased sensitivity to small perturbations when noise of an optimal amplitude is introduced. This feature
is also observed when the condition (31) is satisﬁed, and is illustrated by the behavior of the system studied in the
previous section.

More speciﬁcally, stochastic resonances occur when there is a match between a noise-induced transition rate, rN and
the one produced by an external perturbation. If the latter is assumed to be harmonic of frequency ω0, then typically
πrN . This can be understood by considering a system that initially has 2 degenerate
resonances occur when ω0 ∼
minima, such that the harmonic perturbation will ﬁrst favor one and then the other (alternating with period π/ω0).
If the resonance condition on rN is realized, then the times at which one minima is disfavored will coincide with the
times at which noise-induced transitions to the other minima are most probable, and this enhances the response of
the system to the external perturbation. This behavior is also observed in the systems studied above, for example, the
resonances in Fig. 2 occur when v0 = ω0 where, according to (81), v0 is proportional to the noise-induced transition
rate.

There are, however, some technical diﬀerences. To illustrate these we consider the following one-dimensional system

that exhibits stochastic resonances

˙x = V ′(x, t) + e(t),

V (x, t) = V0(x) + u x cos(ω0t),

where e denotes a stochastic variable, u is a small coupling constant and V0 is a potential with two (degenerate)
minima. The noise is assumed to obey

The usual stochastic resonances occur for uncorrelated noise obeying (84) while resonance behavior in (64)
requires the correlations implied by having a

= 0 in (70).

The resonances described above have the usual shape (see Fig. 2) for the resonant curve. This is not necessarily
the case for the stochastic resonances usually discussed in the literature.

Usual stochastic resonances occur whenever the driving frequency is about half the Kramers’ rate, which depends
exponentially on the noise level F . For the case presented in this paper resonances occur when the driving
frequency is
as deﬁned in (74), and is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the stochastic
variables Ga.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

≪

In this work we propose a formalism which makes possible to study systems under the inﬂuence of rapidly-varying
external ﬁelds (which are not necessarily perturbative) whose typical frequency we denoted by Ω. The formalism
> Ω) and slow
provides a solution as a power series in 1/Ω and assumes a clear separation of fast (frequencies
∼
(frequencies

Ω) modes.

We showed that the evolution of the slow modes is determined by an eﬀective Hamiltonian which is not neces-
sarily Hermitian; a point noted in other related calculations [5]. The non-Hermitian contributions to the eﬀective
Hamiltonian, however, can be eliminated by performing an appropriate unitary transformation.

The formalism was applied to various classical and quantum systems. In some examples we found that the external
ﬁeld can produce a resonant behavior in the system. These resonances are related, but not identical, to the stochastic
resonances studied in the literature [2] In particular the resonant phenomena studied in this paper occur only when
the interaction with the environment involves several correlated terms.

In one particular application of the formalism we argued that the presence of a random time-independent potential
will necessarily generate bound states in systems of dimension 1 and 2, and in other dimensions as well provided
the amplitude of the potential is suﬃciently large. The connection of this result with the phenomenon of Anderson
localization [15] are tantalizing and will be considered in a future publication.

We would like to thank W. Beyermann, R. deCoss and T.J. Weiler for illuminating comments and insights. This
research was supported in part by US DOE contract number DE-FG03-94ER40837(UCR) and by Conacyt (M´exico).

In this appendix we describe a simple construction which generates stochastic variables ga satisfying (70,72), in

terms of a set of uncorrelated variables ni, speciﬁcally, we assume

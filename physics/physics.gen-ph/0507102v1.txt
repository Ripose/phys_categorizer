Geometric Drive of the Universe’s Expansion

José B. Almeida

Universidade do Minho, Physics Department, Braga, Portugal. E-mail: bda@fisica.uminho.pt

Abstract. What if physics is just the way we perceive geometry? That is, what if geometry and physics will one day become
one and the same discipline? I believe that will mean we will at last really understand physics, without postulates other than
those deﬁning the particular space where the physics play is performed. In this paper I use 5-dimensional spacetime as a point
of departure and make a very peculiar assignment between coordinates and physical distances and time. I assume there is an
hyperspherical symmetry which is made apparent by assigning the hypersphere radius to proper time and distances on the
hypersphere to usual 3-dimensional distances. Time, or Compton time to distinguish from cosmic time is the 0th coordinate
and I am able to project everything into 4-dimensions by imposing a null displacement condition.

Surprisingly nothing else is needed to explain Hubble’s expansion law without any appeal to dark matter; an empty
Universe will expand naturally at a ﬂat rate in this way. I then discuss the perturbative effects of a small mass density in
the expansion rate in a qualitative way; quantitative results call for the solution of equations that sometimes have not even
been clearly formulated and so are deferred to later work. A brief outlook of the consequences an hyperspherical symmetry
has for galaxy dynamics allows the derivation of constant rotation velocity curves, again without appealing to dark matter.

An appendix explains how electromagnetism is made consistent with this geometric approach and justiﬁes the fact that

photons must travel on hypersphere circles, to be normal to proper time.

1. INTRODUCTION

The validity of any theory and its usefulness stem from the correctness of the predictions it allows; this is an
unquestionable truth for all physicists and for the public in general. The elegance of a theory, however, is usually
associated to a small number of principles or postulates and to a small set of mathematical equations, even if these turn
out mathematically intricate and difﬁcult to solve. This has been the case with General Relativity (GR) for many years,
a theory which many physicists see as the paradigm of elegance. In spite of the unescapable validity of GR in celestial
mechanics and laboratory experiments, the situation is not as clear in cosmology. The frustration of all known attempts
to unify GR with Quantum Mechanics and the Standard Model of particle physics is another motivation for many
serious people to burn their eyelashes in the search for some alternative way of formulating a new all encompassing
theory.

In this work we will discuss geometry under the assumption that a well chosen geometry will allow, one day, the
derivation of all the equations of physics from purely geometrical relations. This is, to a great extent, a question
of the author’s personal faith without too much evidence to support it at the present time, but enough to motivate
his continued search. If the assumption that physics is born out of geometry is true, then what we have to do is
start off with the appropriate space, make the correct assignments between coordinates and physical entities and
formulate the equations resulting from space symmetries and other space properties; these equations shall be the same
as we encounter in physics. In previous work [1] it was shown that hyperbolic 5-dimensional space, also known as
5-dimensional spacetime, can generate 4-dimensional space without a metric by the condition of null displacement.
This 4D space acquires a metric by promoting one of the coordinates to interval; depending on the choice of coordinate
one can obtain either the usual GR space or an Euclidean 4D space designated as 4-Dimensional Optics (4DO) in view
of the similarities with standard 3-dimensional optics. Mapping of geodesics between the two spaces can be done for
all static metrics, as we will show below; it is not clear at present if the same operation is possible in some cases for
non-static metrics, although it seems very likely that it is not. However, many interesting cases in GR are governed
by a static metric and we can easily analyse these in 4DO to gain a different perspective. Einstein’s equations cannot
be applied in 4DO and a suitable replacement was proposed in the cited paper, which leads to similar results in many
cases but not in extreme ones.

The purpose of this paper is to show how 4DO can be used to explain a ﬂat rate expansion of the Universe under

zero mass density. When one of the coordinates of 4DO is associated with the radius of an hypersphere this coordinate
takes the physical meaning of proper time and ﬂat rate expansion becomes a direct consequence of geometry. The
basic principles involved have been explained in another paper [2] but the formulation is now cleaner than the original
one. The usual 3 spatial coordinates are then associated with arc lengths on the hypersphere surface. The metric of
Euclidean 4-space in hyperspherical coordinates is dependent on the hypersphere radius (proper time) which precludes
its direct mapping into a GR metric; mapping would be possible by resorting to Cartesian coordinates at the expense
of a difﬁcult interpretation of their signiﬁcance. We will also discuss the inﬂuence of non-zero mass density to show
that small curvature and cosmological constants are expected. This conclusion can be reached independently of the set
of equations used to ﬁnd the metric of space with uniform mass density. Schwarzschild’s metric is PPN equivalent to
the exponential metric proposed in both cited papers and consequently it is irrelevant which one is chosen if only ﬁrst
order approximation is envisaged.

Dark matter has been postulated not only to explain the rate of expansion in the Universe but also to account for the
incredible orbital velocities found in spiral galaxies. This is a subject which cannot be properly addressed in this short
presentation; galaxy dynamics is a difﬁcult subject which the author did not investigate properly but, also in this case,
the postulate of 4DO in connection with an hyperspherical Universe seems to provide a qualitative explanation for the
observations. We will give a brief indication of what may become an interesting subject for further work.

2. DYNAMICS IN 5D SPACETIME

In this section we characterize 5-dimensional spacetime and introduce the pertinent geometric algebra, G4,1. For a
comprehensive introduction to geometric algebra readers are referred to the two excellent books [3, 4]; here we will
assume some familiarity with this tool.

This paper is about geometry and its relation to physics, which poses a problem with units right from the start.
Geometry only cares about distances and angles, while physics uses a plethora of different units. Any parallel between
the two ﬁelds must solve the units question right from the start. We note that, at least for the macroscopic world,
physical units can all be reduced to four fundamental ones; we can, for instance, choose length, time, mass and electric
charge as fundamental, as we could just as well have chosen others. Measurements are then made by comparison
with standards; of course we need four standards, one for each fundamental unit. But now note that there are four
fundamental constants: Planck constant (¯h), gravitational constant (G), speed of light in vacuum (c) and proton electric
charge (e), with which we can build four standards for the fundamental units. Table 1 lists the standards of this units’
system, frequently called Planck units, which the author prefers to designate by non-dimensional units. In this system
all the fundamental constants, ¯h, G, c, e, become unity, a particle’s Compton frequency, deﬁned by n = mc2/¯h, becomes
equal to the particle’s mass and the frequent term GM/(c2r) is simpliﬁed to M/r. We can, in fact, take all measures
to be non-dimensional, since the standards are deﬁned with recourse to universal constants; this will be our posture.
Geometry and physics become relations between pure numbers, vectors, bivectors, etc., but the geometric concept of
distance is needed only for graphical representation.

Another problem we have to tackle is one of notation. Since we work in 5 dimensions but need also to consider
4-dimensional and 3-dimensional subspaces, we introduce an indexing convention which allows us to recognize
immediately to which space or subspace each index refers. The following diagram shows the index naming convention
used in this paper.

Indices in the range {0, 4} will be denoted with Greek letters i , k , l . Indices in the range {0, 3} will also receive Greek
letters but chosen from m , n , x . For indices in the range {1, 4} we will use Latin letters i, j, k and ﬁnally for indices in
the range {1, 3} we will use also Latin letters chosen from m, n, o. Einstein’s summation convention will be adopted, as
well as the compact notation for partial derivatives ¶ i = ¶ /¶ xi . When convenient we will also make the assignments
justiﬁed in Almeida [1]: x0 ≡ t and x4 ≡ t . The squares of coordinates will be denoted by enclosing in parenthesis, to
avoid confusion with superscript indices, but the same procedure will not be needed for t, t and spherical coordinates.
The geometric algebra G4,1 of the hyperbolic 5-dimensional space we want to consider is generated by the frame of

orthonormal vectors s

(s 0)2 = −1,

• 5 tetravectors (4-volume), is

and we notice it can be decomposed into a symmetric part, a scalar called the inner or interior product, and an anti-
symmetric part, a bivector called the outer or exterior product.

Reversing the deﬁnition one can write inner and outer products as

When a vector is operated with a multivector the inner product reduces the grade of each element by one unit and the
outer product increases the grade by one. By convention the inner product of a vector and a scalar produces a vector.

The rotation angle is |B| and the rotation plane is deﬁned by B. A rotor is deﬁned as a unitary even multivector (a
multivector with even grade components only) which squares to unity; we are particularly interested in rotors with
bivector components. It is more general to deﬁne a rotation by a plane (bivector) then by an axis (vector) because the
latter only works in 3D while the former is applicable in any dimension.

Collapsing 5-dimensional space into 4 dimensions can be achieved by a projection; we choose to make this transition
by imposing a null displacement condition, that is, the norm of the displacement vector must be null;

and this is equivalent to either of the relations

(dx0)2 =(cid:229)
(dxi)2;
(dx4)2 =(dx0)2 − (cid:229)

(dxm)2.

The former of these relations deﬁnes an Euclidean 4-space where (dx0)2 is taken as interval and the latter deﬁnes
Minkowski spacetime with (dx4)2 as interval. We see by this construction that Euclidean and Minkowski 4-spaces
can be taken as belonging to the null subspace of 5D spacetime; we can obtain one or the other, depending on the
coordinate that we choose for interval. Remember though we are only considering displacements along geodesics,
i.e. straight lines. A very different approach to the same subject was used in [5] and the ﬁrst author to notice this
equivalence was probably Montanus [6, 7].

Everything that was said above is true in geometry and has no implications for physics until we decide to assign
some of the coordinates to physical entities. Some of those assignments are carried over from previous work; for
instance we have already established that coordinate x0 is to be taken as time and coordinate x4 as proper time [1];
accordingly we will frequently represent x0 with the letter t and x4 with the letter t . We will also simplify the notation
for time and proper time derivatives by writing d f /dt ≡ ˙f ; d f /dt ≡ ˇf .

Dividing both members of (13) by dt one deﬁnes a 4-dimensional velocity vector v;

If we are in the null displacement subspace ( ˙x)2 is necessarily null and we recognize that v is unitary

The velocity vector can then be obtained by rotation of any unitary vector and it is particularly interesting to note that
it can be expressed as a rotation of the s 4 frame vector.

The rotation angle is a measure of the 3-dimensional, physical, velocity. A null angle corresponds to a v directed along
s 4 and null physical velocity, while a p /2 angle corresponds to the maximum physical velocity. The idea that physical
velocity can be seen as the 3D component of a unitary 4D vector has been explored in several papers but see [8].

Instead of dividing (13) by dt we can divide by dt , obtaining

squaring the second member and noting that it must be null we obtain

We then deﬁne a bivector, called relativistic 4-velocity, by

such that u 2 = uu = 1. The relativistic 4-velocity is a bivector in this space and not a vector as in special relativity
but it represents the same physical concept; in particular we note that any 4-velocity can be obtained by a Lorentz
transformation of bivector s 04.

u = ˜T s 04T,
(24)
where T is of the form T = exp(B) and B is a bivector whose plane is normal to s 4. Note that T is a pure rotation
when the bivector plane is normal to both s 0 and s 4.

In order to study dynamics we must introduce bent space by allowing for non-orthonormed frame vectors;

gi = nk

i s

k ,

gi is called the refractive index frame and nk
i the refractive index tensor or simply the refractive index. The designation
is borrowed from 3D optics and the refractive index tensor can be seen as the 5D generalization of a dielectric refractive
index. The deﬁnition of frame vectors with recourse to the orthonormed frame can only be applied to bent spaces and

˙x = s 0 + s

i ˙xi = s 0 + v.

v·v = (cid:229)

v = ˜Rs 4R.

ˇx = s 0 ˇx0 + s m ˇxm + s 4;

not to general curved ones but we believe this is sufﬁcient for expressing all dynamics; most of the derivations that
follow, however, would apply equally well to spaces of general curvature. We introduce now the reciprocal frame gi
such that [3]

In non-orthonormed frames we deﬁne the elementary optical displacement vector

The designation is again borrowed from 3D optics and calls for the optical path length. For simplicity we will consider
only those cases where

(28)
to get ds = s 0dt + gidxi. That is, we are considering only spaces where the refractive index is a 4-rank tensor and does
not modify the zeroth frame vector. A further simpliﬁcation results from imposing that the refractive index depends
only on the 3 spatial xm coordinates1. We now replace the null displacement condition by a similar condition applied
to optical displacement. From ds2 = 0 we write immediately

j;

g0 = s 0,

gi = n j

is

where gi j = gi·g j. This is interpreted as the metric of 4D space with Euclidean signature, or 4DO space.

Multiplying the optical displacement (27) on the right and on the left by g4, simultaneously replacing x4 by t we

obtain

dsg4 = s 0g4dt + gmg4dxm + g4g4dt ;
g4ds = g4s 0dt + g4gmdxm + g4g4dt .

Multiplying the two equations member by member, the ﬁrst member becomes g44ds2 and must therefore be null. We
have then

0 = g44

−dt2 + gmndxmdxn + g44dt 2

.

Note that non-scalar terms in the second member cancel out necessarily, so that the ﬁrst member can be null.
Rearranging the equation we can write

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

dt 2 =

dt2 − gmndxmdxn

(cid:0)

This is clearly a GR metric if the second member depends only on the xm coordinates, that is, if the metric is static. We
have thus established a metric conversion method between GR and 4DO applicable to static metrics. The importance
of this conclusion cannot be overstressed; we have concluded that geodesics of 4DO and GR spaces can be mapped to
each other when the refractive index is a function only of the 3 spatial coordinates. When this happens any dynamics
which can be studied as free fall in GR can also be studied as free fall in 4DO, providing a different angle of approach
to the same problem.

The geodesics of 4DO space can be found, as in any other space, by consideration of the Lagrangian [9]

(cid:1)

from the Lagrangian one derives immediately the conjugate momenta

¶ ˙xi = gi j ˙x j.

Note the use of the lower index (vi) to represent conjugate momenta while velocity components have an upper index
(vi). The conjugate momenta are the components of the conjugate momentum vector v = givi, which can be written in
two alternative forms

v = givi = gigi j ˙x j = g jv j.

We conclude that conjugate momentum and velocity are the same vector but their components are referred to the
reciprocal and refractive index frames, respectively. The geodesic equations can now be written in the form of Euler-
Lagrange equations

˙vi = ¶ iL;

Space is isotropic if the refractive index does not depend on direction, and so the three gm vectors must be related to
s m by a common scale factor, which may be a function of position. The scale coefﬁcient for g4 does not need to be the
same as for the other frame vectors and hence we will characterize an isotropic space by the refractive index frame

We analyse now the constraints on the refractive index so that experimental data on light bending and perihelium
advance in closed orbits can be predicted; this will allow us to propose another set of refractive indices which will be
more convenient than those just obtained. Light rays are characterized by dt = 0 both in 4DO and in general relativity;
the effective refractive index for light is then

To account for light bending we have established that nr ≈ 1 + 2mb. For n4 we need 2nd order approximation [11], so

For compatibility with Kepler’s 1st order predictions a = 1; then, for compatibility with observed planet orbits,
b = 1/2. Together with the constraint for n0, these are the conditions that must be veriﬁed by the refractive indices to
be in agreement with experimental data; any refractive indices verifying such conditions are then perfectly legitimate
in terms of predictions for those two observations.

We know, of course, that the refractive indices corresponding to Schwarzschild’s metric verify the constraints above,
however that is not the only possibility. Schwarzschild’s metric is a consequence of Einstein’s equations when one
postulates that vacuum is empty of mass and energy, but the same does not necessarily apply in 4DO. In [1] we
proposed a counterpart to Einstein equations in 4DO whose solutions are in full agreement with observations; the
resulting refractive index is

Montanus [7] arrives at the same solutions with a different reasoning; the same metric is also due to Yilmaz [12, 13,
14, 15].

These refractive index coefﬁcients are as effective as those derived from Schwarzschild’s metric for light bending
and perihelium advance prediction for small m/r; there is one singularity for r = 0 which is not a physical difﬁculty
since before that stage quantum phenomena have to be considered and the metric ceases to be applicable; in other
words, we must change from geometric to wave optics approach.

3. HYPERSPHERICAL COORDINATES

Deriving physical equations and predictions from purely geometrical equations is an exercise whose success depends
on the correct assignment of coordinates to physical entities; the same space will produce different predictions if
different options are taken for coordinate assignment. Since the birth of special relativity it has been usual to assign
three coordinates to orthogonal directions in physical space and a zeroth coordinate to time. This is a totally arbitrary
assignment, which has gained acceptance by the correct predictions it originates in many circumstances. We discussed
above that it is also perfectly legitimate to replace the assignment of coordinate zero to time by an assignment of
coordinate four with proper time. Geodesic (straight line) movement can be predicted equally well in both cases. In
terms of curvature, ﬂat space is usually associated with absolute emptiness in a physical sense.

We are now going to experiment with a different assignment of ﬂat space coordinates, which will explore the
possibility that physics and the Universe have an inbuilt hyperspherical symmetry. The exercise consists on assigning
coordinate x4 = t to the radius of an hypersphere and the three xm coordinates to distances measured on the hypersphere
surface. If the hypersphere radius is very large we will not be able to notice the curvature on everyday phenomena, in
the same way as everyday displacements on Earth don’t seem curved to us; but the Universe as a whole will manifest
the consequences of its hyperspherical symmetry. Using the Earth as a 3-dimensional analogue of an hyperspherical
Universe, although our everyday life is greatly unaffected by Earth’s curvature the atmosphere senses this curvature
and shows manifestations of it in winds and climate. What we propose here is an exercise; it is an arbitrary assignment
between coordinates and physical entities; the validity of such exercise can only be judged by the predictions it allows
and how well they conform with observations.

Hyperspherical coordinates are characterized by one distance coordinate, t and three angles r , q , j ; following the

In order to write an elementary displacement dx we must consider the rotation of frame vectors, but we don’t need to
think hard about it because we can extend what is known from ordinary spherical coordinates [16].

dx = s 0dt + s 4dt + ts

Just as before, we consider only null displacements to obtain time intervals;

dt2 = dt 2 + t 2

.

The velocity vector, v = ˙x − s 0, can be immediately obtained from the displacement vector dividing by dt

Geodesics of ﬂat space are naturally straight lines, no matter which coordinate system we use, however it is useful to
derive geodesic equations from a Lagrangian of the form (34); in hyperspherical coordinates the Lagrangian becomes

2L = v2 = ˙t 2 + t 2

˙r 2 + sin2 r

˙q 2 + sin2 q

.

Because de Lagrangian is independent of j we can establish a conserved quantity

It may seem strange that any physically meaningful relation can be derived from the simple coordinate assignment
that we have made, that is, proper time is associated with hypersphere radius and the three usual space coordinates
are assigned to distances on the hypersphere radius. This unexpected fact results from the possibility offered by
hyperspherical coordinates to explore a symmetry in the Universe that becomes hidden when we use Cartesian
coordinates. In the real world we measure distances between objects, namely cosmological objects, rather than angles;
we have therefore to deﬁne a distance coordinate, which is obviously r = tr
. It does not matter where in the Universe
we place the origin for r and we ﬁnd it convenient to place ourselves on the origin.

Radial velocities ˙r measure movement in a radial direction from our observation point; we are particularly interested

in this type of movement in order to ﬁnd a link to the Hubble relation. Applying the chain rule and then replacing r

˙r = r ˙t + ˙rt =

We expect objects that have not suffered any interaction to move along s
˙r = ˙q = ˙j = 0 and then ˙t becomes unity. Replacing in the equation above and rearranging

t ; from (59) we see that this implies

What this equation tells us is exactly what is expressed by the Hubble relation. The value of t can be taken as constant
for any given observation because the distance information is carried by photons and these preserve proper time2. The

compatible with electromagnetism is brieﬂy discussed in the appendix.

ﬁrst member of the equation is the deﬁnition of the Hubble parameter and we can then write H = 1/t . In this way we
ﬁnd the physical meaning of coordinate t as being the Universe’s age.

How does the use of hyperspherical coordinates affect dynamics in our laboratory experiments? We would like to
know if these coordinates need only be considered in problems of cosmological scale or, on the contrary, there are
implications for everyday experiments. The answer implies rewriting (57) with distance rather than angle coordinates;
replacing r ,

This would be a version of (16) in spherical coordinates, were it not for the extra terms with powers of r/t
in the
second member. The coefﬁcient r/t
implies a comparison between the distance from the object to the observer and
the size of the Universe; remember that t
is both time and distance in non-dimensional units. We can say that ordinary
special relativity will apply for objects which are near us, but distant objects will show in their movement an effect of
the Universe’s hyperspherical nature.

We have established the refractive indices nr (54) and n4 (55) to account for the dynamics near a massive sphere
using Cartesian coordinates; since this is frequently applied on a cosmological scale, we must ﬁnd out how the
dynamics is modiﬁed by the use of hyperspherical coordinates. Using the refractive indices and hyperspherical
coordinates, noting that nr = n2

If we want to apply these equations to cosmology it is easiest to follow the approach of Newtonian cosmology,
which produces basically the same results as the relativistic approach but presumes that the observer is at the centre of
the Universe [10, 17]. In order to adopt a relativistic approach we need equations that replace Einstein’s in 4DO. A set
of such equations has been proposed [1] but their application in cosmology has not yet been tested, so we will have to
defer this more correct approach to a forthcoming paper. The strategy is to consider a general object at distance r from
the observer, moving away from the latter under the gravitational inﬂuence of the mass included in a sphere of radius
r. If we designate by m
r3/3; this will have to be
considered further down.

the average mass density in the Universe, then mass m in (71) is 4pm

Friedman equation governs standard cosmology and can be derived both from Newtonian and relativistic dynamics,
with different consequences in terms of the overall size of the Universe and the observer’s privileged position. From
the cited references we write Friedman equation as

with L
a cosmological constant and k the curvature constant; the gravitational constant was not included because it
is unity in non-dimensional units and the equation is written in real, not comoving, coordinates. In order to compare
(71) with Friedman equation there is a problem with the last term because the Hubble parameter ˙r/r does not appear
isolated in the ﬁrst member; we will ﬁnd a way to circumvent the problem later on but ﬁrst let us look at what (71) tells
us when the mass density is zeroed. In this case n4 = 1 and we ﬁnd from (68) that ˙t
is non-zero, for
which we can ﬁnd no reasonable explanation. Replacing n4 and ˙t with unity in (71) we ﬁnd that ˙r/r = 1/t , conﬁrming
what had already been found in (63). Comparing with Friedman equation, this corresponds to a ﬂat Universe with a
critical mass density m = m c; it is immediately obvious that m c = 3/(8pt
2). Let us not overlook the importance of this
conclusion because it completely removes the need for a critical density if the Universe is ﬂat; remember this is one
of the main reasons to invoke dark matter in standard cosmology. Notice also that this conclusion does not depend on
a privileged observer, because it is just a consequence of space symmetry and not of dynamics.

is unity, unless ˙r

Let us now see what happens when we consider a small mass density; here we are talking about matter that is
observed or measured in some way but not postulated matter. The matter density that we will consider is of the order
of 1% of the presently accepted value. It is therefore just a perturbation of the ﬂat solution that we described above
and the fact that we are presuming a privileged observer has to be taken just for this perturbation. The ﬁrst thing we
note when we consider matter density is that ˙t < 1, because there is now a component of the velocity vector along s
r .
Ideally we should solve the Euler-Lagrange equations resulting from (68) in order to ﬁnd ˙t and ˙r but this is a difﬁcult
process and we shall carry on with just a qualitative discussion. Considering that we are discussing a perturbation it is
legitimate to make ˙r/r ≈ ˙t /t and the two last terms in the second member of (71) can be combined into one single
term ( ˙t /t )2, the same as we encountered for the ﬂat solution, albeit with a numerator slightly smaller than unity. The
ﬁrst term has now become slightly positive and we can see from Friedman equation that this corresponds to a negative
curvature constant, k, and to an open Universe. Lastly the second term includes the mass m of a sphere with radius r and
can be simpliﬁed to 8pm
( ˙t 2 − 2)/3; this has the effect of a negative cosmological constant; the combined effect of the
two terms is expected to close the Universe [9, 17]. The previous discussion was done in qualitative terms, making use
of several approximations, for which reason we must question some of the ﬁndings and expect that after more detailed
examination they may not be quite as anticipated; in particular there is concern about the refractive indices used, which
were derived in Cartesian coordinates both by the author and those that preceded him in using an exponential metric;
it may happen that the transposition to hyperspherical coordinates has not been properly made, with consequences in
the perturbative analysis that was superimposed on the ﬂat solution. The latter, however, is totally independent of such
concerns and allows us to state that the assumption of hyperspherical symmetry for the Universe dispenses with dark
matter in accounting for the gross of observed expansion.

Dark matter is also called in cosmology to account for the extremely high rotation velocities found in spiral galaxies
[18, 19] and we will now take a brief look at how hyperspherical symmetry can help explain this phenomenon. Galaxy
dynamics is an extremely complex subject, which we do not intend to explore here due to lack of space but most of
all due to lack of author’s competence to approach it with any rigour; we will just have a very brief outlook at the
equation for ﬂat orbits, to notice that an effect similar to the familiar Coriollis effect on Earth can arise in an expanding
hyperspherical Universe and this could explain most of the observed velocities on the periphery of galaxies. Let us
recall (64), divide by dt and invoke null displacement to obtain the velocity

Suppose now that something in the galaxy is pushing outwards slightly, so that the parenthesis is zero; this happens
if ˙r/r = ˙t /t and can be caused by a pressure gradient, for instance. The result is that (76) now accepts solutions with
constant r ˙j
, which is exactly what is observed in many cases; swirls will be maintained by a radial expansion rate
which exactly matches the quotient ˙t /t . In any practical situation ˙t will be very near unity and the quotient will be
virtually equal to the Hubble parameter; thus the expansion rate for sustained rotation is ˙r/r ≈ H. If applied to our
neighbour galaxy Andromeda, with a radial extent of 30 kpc, using the Hubble parameter value of 81 km s−1/Mpc,
the expansion velocity is about 2.43 km s−1; this is to be compared with the orbital velocity of near 300 km s−1 and
probably within the error margins. An expansion of this sort could be present in many galaxies and go undetected
because it needs only be of the order of 1% the orbital velocity.

4. CONCLUSION

The approach to the equations that govern the Universe examined in this paper can be compared to the revolution
brought to 15th century geography and navigation by the consideration of a spherical Earth, a concept as old as
Pythagoras and Aristotle but not widely accepted until then. It is unimaginable today to explain any world scale
phenomenon without recourse to spherical coordinates, because these make full exploitation of Earth’s spherical
symmetry and render equations enormously simpler than they would be if expressed in Cartesian coordinates.

Making an hypothesis that the Universe as a whole has an inbuilt hyperspherical symmetry we were able to derive
Hubble’s law as a direct consequence of geometry in a Universe completely devoid of any matter. The existence of a
minute mass density can then be seen to introduce a perturbation in the main picture, being responsible for a slight
curvature and a small cosmological constant. Similarly to what happens in the Earth’s atmosphere, we were also able to
demonstrate the existence of constant rotation velocity swirls that can be the basis for understanding galaxy dynamics.
Mathematically the argument was set on purely geometrical grounds, with 5-dimensional spacetime as a point of
departure. This space was shown to produce both GR spacetime and an Euclidean metric 4-dimensional space, by an
imposition of null displacement. Euclidean metric 4D space was then used to formulate the hyperspherical symmetry
hypothesis and derive its consequences.

easiest way to include electromagnetism in the geometry of 5-dimensional spacetime is to consider a non-orthonormed
frame; in terms of the reciprocal frame we make

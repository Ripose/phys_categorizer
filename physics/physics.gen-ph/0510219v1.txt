Relativity from absoluteness

(Dated: 25 October 2005)

The shortening of bodies in the direction of motion follows from Maxwell’s equations. Because
of the Lorentz contraction moving clocks tick more slowly than static ones. An observer does not
know about his motion relative to the absolute frame of reference. So, in order to synchronize spaced
clocks in a moving reference frame he uses the same procedure as in the absolute frame. We deduce
the Lorentz transform from the synchronization procedure and Lorentz contraction. The absolute
frame can not be distinguished among other inertial reference frames since the Lorentz transform
constitutes an algebraic group.

1. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS

In a narrow sense the subject matter of special theory of relativity (SRT) is a description of phenomena in inertial
frames of reference (IRF). Reference frames are referred to as inertial if they are in uniform translatory motion relative
to each other.

SRT includes in itself a derivation of the transformation between IRFs as well as the principle of relativity. This

may be assumed as the content of SRT.

to solve appropriate equations.

The aim of SRT is to reveal a symmetry of fundamental laws of nature. The knowledge of the symmetry helps us

The absolutist approach is based on the following assumptions.
There is a reference frame where Maxwell’s equations hold in their usual form.
The speed of light does not depend on the motion of a light source.
With an eye to interpret some eﬀects we say about an absolute frame of reference (ARF).

2. LORENTZ CONTRACTION IS A REAL PHYSICAL EFFECT

Let we have an ARF where Maxwell’s equations are valid. Consider two electric charges that are on the x-axis at

a distance |x| from each other. The force of interaction of the charges is

Next we consider the same pair of charges moving uniformly along the x-axis with the velocity v relative to ARF.
Solving1 Maxwell’s equations we ﬁnd that the interaction force is

F (γ(x − vt))

γ =

l

= l/γ

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

According to (2) the force ﬁeld shrinks by the factor γ in the direction of motion. Relation (2) enables us to suggest
that any body that moves uniformly in a straight line with a velocity v relative to ARF contracts γ times in the
direction of motion

where l is the length of a body at rest and l′ the length of the body in motion.

3. THE DISTANCE IS THE READING OF A MEASURING DEVICE, THE FOOT-RULE

When a ruler is moving its length decreases in accord with the relation (4). Let x′ denote the distance of a point
from the origin of coordinates measured in the moving reference frame. The same distance measured in ARF equals

to x − vt. The distance between objects does not change when they move simultaneously. Therefore we have

Substituting (4) in (5) we ﬁnd the transformation of space coordinate to the moving reference frame

= (x − vt)l

= γ(x − vt)

Formula (6) agrees with the argument of the function (2) that represents the moving force ﬁeld.

4. THE TIME IS THE READING OF A MEASURING DEVICE, THE CLOCK

The Lorentz contraction leads to that a moving clock shows the time diﬀerent from the clock at rest. The clock-
work always is based on some periodic (oscillatory) process. The period of vibration can be taken as a unit of time
(duration). To measure the time we commonly use a pendulum (see appendix A). But we do not yet know the
equation of relativistic mechanics. Therefore we will use a device, known as a light clock, whose law of action was
taken by us as one of the postulates: the speed of light does not depend on motion of a source.

An impulse of light circulates between two mirrors. The mirrors are mounted on a rigid bed one against another
at a distance l. When the light clock is at rest in ARF, the time that the light propagates there and back, i.e. the
period of the process, is

When the clock is in motion the length of the bed decreases and the distance between the mirrors becomes l′. We
have for the path in the forward direction

and for the return path

Summing (8) and (9) we ﬁnd the period of oscillations

Substituting (4) in (10) with the account of (3)

Comparing (7) with (11) we ﬁnd with the account of (3) that the moving clock shows the dilation of time

5. MEASUREMENT OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT

In order to determine the speed of light experimentally we need only one clock. In a moving RF there is a mirror
at a distance ∆x′ from the clock’s location. At some moment a burst of light is emitted from the point of the clock’s
location. The light is reﬂected from the mirror and return to the source. At this moment we measure the time interval
∆t′ elapsed. The speed of light can be found from the relation

According to (6) we have

6. SYNCHRONIZATION OF CLOCKS

We will set spaced in ARF clocks to one and the same time. Let the light clock placed in the origin of coordinates

ticked oﬀ n periods. The time shown by it is

Substituting (7) in (19)

Substituting (21) in (20) we ﬁnd

By the clock’s device the light covers the distance 2ln over the time (20) elapsed. The same distance a light impulse
will run during this time reaching the point

Thus, for the synchronization each clock in ARF must be set to the time (22) in the instant when the light signal
emitted in the beginning of the time recording arrives at the point x of the clock’s location. The course of the time t
in the point x is then pictured by the formula (here tautological)

where ¯t is given by (21), and t is the absolute time that corresponds to the reading of the clock located in the origin
of coordinates.

7. SYNCHRONIZATION OF CLOCKS IN A MOVING FRAME OF REFERENCE

From the absolute point of view in a moving reference frame the speed of light depends on the direction of the
speed motion (see (8) and (9)). However, being in the moving RF, we do not know about this and for the tuning of
spaced clocks we continue to use the same procedure as was used for the synchronization of clocks in ARF. We set a
clock located at x′ to the time

at the moment when the light signal comes to the point x′. Formula (24) is analogous to (22). In accord with (13)
we suppose in (24) that the speed of light is one and the same in all directions and has the same value (18) as before.
After the clocks were adjusted the further run of the time is described by the formula

where the scale factor γ allows for the dilation of time (12). Formula (25) is an analog of (23). By the construction,
the pair of values x′, ¯t′ from (24) corresponds to the pair of values x, ¯t from (22). Substituting the latter pair for x
and t in (6), we can insert the result into the right-hand part of (24)

Formulae (6) and (28) deﬁne the transfer from ARF to a moving RF according to:

1) the real length contraction (4),
2) the change of the rate of time (12) following from it,
3) the dependence of the time reference point on the space coordinate that follows from the isotropy of space in the

moving RF assumed by us conditionally (and unconsciously) in (24).

8. THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION

We deﬁne inertial frames of reference (IRF) as reference frames obtained from the absolute reference frame by the

Lorentz transformation (6) and (28).

Next I shall show that the transition between two inertial reference frames

is carried out by a Lorentz transformation too. Let us accomplish (29) in the following way

Transition ARF → IRF is given by the transformation (6), (28). The return pass can be found from (6), (28) with the
account of (3)

Let IRF1 move relative to ARF with the velocity v1. We have from (32), (33) with the account of (3) for the transition
(30)

Let IRF2 move relative to ARF with the velocity v2. We have from (6), (28) with the account of (3) for the transition
(31)

Substituting (34), (35) in (36), (37), we will express x2, t2 via x1, t1:

According (38), (39) any IRF are connected with each other by the Lorentz transformation. In this event, we proved
that the Lorentz transformation forms a group with the group operation (40). Here this operation is given for
parameters v2 and −v1. The group property tell us that the absolute frame of reference is indistinguishable among
other inertial frames of reference.

A question remains. Can we consider v12 as a motion velocity of IRF2 relative to IRF1?

9. THE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY

I shall show that Maxwell’s equations have the same form in IRF as they have in ARF. The equation for the electric

charge q which is at rest in ARF is

For the same charge moving in ARF with velocity v

Let us pass over to IRF moving relative to ARF with the velocity v substituting (6) and (28) in (42). The property
of δ-function will be used

Thus we have shown that a charge which is at rest in a moving RTF is described by equation (44) of the same form
(41) as the charge which is at rest in ARF. This proves for the particular case the principle of relativity: a physical
phenomenon is described in all inertial reference frames by the same equations.

Next, let the charge move in the IRF with velocity v∗. We may then to write down in place of (44)

We will pass from the IRF to IRF* by means of the Lorentz transformation

∂xE = 4πqδ(x)

∂xE = 4πqδ(x − vt)

δ(ax) = δ(x)/a,

the IRF. Equation (45) will look in IRF* as

∗
∂x∗ E = 4πqδ(x
According to (49) the charge is at rest in IRF*. Insofar as by deﬁnition (45) the charge moves with velocity v∗ relative
to the IRF, equation (49) shows that the very system IRF* moves relative to the IRF with the velocity v∗. This
proves that parameter v∗ in the transformation (46)-(48) has the meaning of the velocity of the IRF* relative to the
IRF.

)

By the principle of relativity, equations of classical mechanics must have one and the same form in each IRF. Let

us show that this principle is satisﬁed by the form in the left-hand part of the following motion equation

11. ONCE AGAIN ON THE LORENTZ CONTRACTION

The Lorentz contraction is understood here as the real shrinkage of a moving body. In the case of transformation

the Lorentz contraction is given by formula (4) with (3). Sometimes the reality of the length contraction is argued. In
this event the following paradox can be pointed to. After the transition (58) was performed we will launch the body
in the reverse direction, i.e. we will impart to it the velocity −v. By virtue of the relativity principle above derived
we can write down Maxwell’s equations in IRF and then obtain from it the result analogous to (2)

where γ is given by the same formula (3). Earlier we concluded from (2) that the length l′ of a body in IRF is related
to its length l in ARF by formula (4). Similarly to (2) the form (59) would seem to imply that

ARF → IRF

F (γ(x + vt

))

′

′

l = l

/γ

(invalid!)

Comparing (60) with (4) we come to a contradiction.

Yet, relation (60) is wrong. This is because, unlike (2), the argument of the function (59) contains not the absolute
time t but the local one t′. And the very local time was received by us via the procedure which includes not only the
real change of the time rate but also a conditional and unconscious apprehension that the space is isotropic. Suppose,
for example, that we passed over to a moving RF and retain in it the absolute time. Then, concerning this frame,
the principle of relativity will not be valid. Hence we will be unable to write down in it Maxwell’s equations in their
usual form. And thus we could not obtain the form analogous to (59)

F (γ(x + vt)) (this is wrong for IRF → ARF)

supposed paradox of Lorentz contraction.

In the conclusion I shall give explicitly a correct formula for the Lorentz contraction in the case of the relative

motion of two IRFs (29). By (4), (3) we have for a body that moves with the velocity v1 relative to ARF

In the case of a body that moves with the velocity v2 relative to ARF

The duration (A2) can be taken as a unit of time.

If the oscillator moves as a whole with the velocity v we must introduce in the expression of the force the displacement

from the equilibrium point vt and also the scaling factor γ (3), i.e. in accord with (2) the force will be

Substituting (A3) into relativistic equation of motion (50)

[1 − (dx/dt)2/c2]3/2 = −γk(x − vt)

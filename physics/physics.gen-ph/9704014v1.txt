Conceivable new recycling of nuclear
waste by nuclear power companies
in their plants

Abstract. We outline the basic principles and the needed experiments for
a conceivable new recycling of nuclear waste by the power plants themselves
to avoid its transportation and storage to a (yet unknown) dumping area.
Details are provided in an adjoining paper and in patents pending.

1 Introduction

The recycling of nuclear waste is certainly one of the largest open problems
of contemporary science, industry and society. Current studies (see, e.g.,
[1a]) are essentially conducted under the assumption of ﬁrst transporting the
waste to a (yet unknown) dumping area, and then recycling it, e.g., via the
construction of a huge particle accelerator for the individual smashing of the
waste nuclei (see, e.g., [1b]).

Even though technically possible and quantitatively predictable on grounds
of current knowledge, this approach is not immune from problematic aspects,
such as: the high cost of ﬁrst transporting and storing the waste and then
recycling it (estimated in the range of hundred of billions of dollars in the
U.S. alone [1a], with similar expenditures predicted for Europe); the dan-
ger to the public caused by the fact that the transportation of the highly
radioactive waste can only occur via ordinary trucks traveling in ordinary
streets (thus being predictably opposed by consumer groups); the long time
needed for the above recycling (estimated in the range of hundred of years
due to the thousands of tonnages of radioactive waste to be recycled); etc.

In this note we initiate the study of novel means of recycling nuclear waste
speciﬁcally conceived to be usable by the nuclear power companies in their
own plants, e.g., in their water pools, thus avoiding altogether the costly and
dangerous transportation of the waste to a dumping area. The new recycling
might also stimulate a new industry for the development and production of
the needed new equipment for all interested nuclear power plants.

Due to the practical impossibility of building large particle accelerators
inside nuclear power plants, the only possible alternative is to identify means
capable of disrupting the nuclei of the waste via resonating or other mecha-
nisms, so as to drastically reduce meanlives from current values of the order
of thousands of years, down to values of the order of weeks or days.

It should be indicated from the outset that the latter means are not pre-
dicted by relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) and its underlying Poincar´e
symmetry P (3.1) because, in their realization via the familiar Dirac equa-
tion, the latter structures predict perennial and immutable meanlives. Thus,
quantitative studies of the desired new forms of recycling nuclear waste “in
house” require a suitable broadening of RQM and related Poincar´e symmetry.
In this note we recall that RQM is exactly valid for the atomic structure
but not for the nuclear structure with predicted small deviations of crucial

2

relevance for the desired recycling; we point out a broadening of RQM known
under the name of relativistic hadronic mechanics (RHM) with corresponding
broadening of its basic Poincar´e symmetry, speciﬁcally constructed for the
nuclear structure with extended and deformable nucleons; we point out that
the alterability of the intrinsic magnetic moment of nucleons is a necessary
condition for the representation of total nuclear magnetic moments and we
present its ﬁrst exact-numerical representation via RHM under conventional
values of spin and angular momentum; we indicate that the alterability of
the intrinsic magnetic moments of the neutron implies the alterability of its
meanlife via subnuclear processes; we present the basic principle of the pro-
posed new recycling of nuclear waste based on subnuclear resonating mech-
anism which stimulate the beta decay of the neutron; and we ﬁnally point
out three fundamental experiments which are essential for additional studies
in the proposed new recycling.

A detailed presentation is available in the adjoining paper [1c] and in
patents pending. The reader should be warned against unreasonable expec-
tations of quick solutions in view of the magnitude and complexity of the
problem whose solution will predictably require a comprehensive collegial ef-
fort encompassing all current and new scientiﬁc and industrial knowledge in
nuclear physics.

2 Lack of exact character of relativistic

quantum mechanics in nuclear physics

RQM resulted to be exact for the atomic structure because it represented
in an exact way all its experimental data. By comparison, RQM cannot
be exact for the nuclear structure because it has been unable to provide
an exact representation of all its experimental data, such as total magnetic
moments and other data [2]. The understanding is that RQM does indeed
provide a good approximation of nuclear data. However, as we shall see, even
though evidently small, the expected deviations have a fundamental role for
the desired new recycling of nuclear waste.

The lack of exact character of RQM in nuclear physics can also be seen
in a number of independent ways, a compelling one being that based on
symmetries. Computer visualization of the Poincar´e symmetry indicates its

3

capability to represent Keplerian systems, i.e., systems with the heaviest con-
stituent in the center, as occurring in the atomic structure. By comparison,
nuclei do not have nuclei and, therefore, the Poincar´e symmetry must be
broken to represent structures without the Keplerian center. In turn, as we
shall see, the latter breaking is fully in line with the deviations from P (3.1)
required by the representation of nuclear magnetic moments.

The most compelling arguments are of dynamical nature. RQM was con-
structed for the characterization of action-at-a-distance interactions deriv-
able from a potential, as occurring in the atomic structure. By comparison,
nucleons in a nuclear structure are in an average state of mutual penetra-
tion of about 10−3 parts of their charge distribution [3a]. But hadrons are
some of the densest objects measured in laboratory until now. Their mutual
penetration therefore implies a (generally small) component of the nuclear
force which is: 1) of contact type i.e., with zero-range, thus requiring new
interactions without particle exchanges; 2) nonlinear in the wave functions
and, possibly, their derivatives, thus requiring a theory with an exact super-
position principle under said nonlinearity; 3) nonlocal, e.g., of integral-type
over the volume of overlapping, thus requiring a new topology; 4) nonpoten-
tial, in the sense of violating the conditions to be derivable from a potential
or a Hamiltonian [3b], thus requiring new dynamical equations; and 5) of
consequential nonunitarity type as a necessary condition to exit from the
equivalence class of RQM, thus requiring new mathematical methods.

3 Relativistic hadronic mechanics

The insuﬃciencies of RQM for the nuclear structure (as well as for the struc-
ture of hadrons and stars here ignored) have been recognized by various
physicists, resulting in a number of research lines, such as the well known
q-deformations, quantum groups, and others. Unfortunately, even though
mathematically impeccable, these deformations are aﬄicted by a number of
problematic aspects of physical character [3c], besides implying an evident
departure from the axioms of the special relativity (SR).

In this note we use a covering of RQM known as relativistic hadronic
mechanics (RHM), originally submitted and studied by Santilli [4] (for in-
dependent studies see monographs [5] and papers quoted therein), which
apparently resolves the above problematic aspects, and permits quantitative

4

and invariant studies of nuclear structures with extended, nonspherical and
deformable nucleons under nonlinear, nonlocal and nonunitary nuclear forces
[4h].

RHM is constructed via axiom-preserving maps of RQM called isotopies
[4a] here referred to maps of any given linear, local-diﬀerential and unitary
theory into its most general possible nonlinear, nonlocal-integral and nonuni-
tary extensions which are nevertheless capable of reconstructing linearity,
locality and unitarity on certain generalized spaces called isospaces, over cer-
tain generalized ﬁelds called isoﬁelds. The alterations characterized by RHM
are called mutations [6] in order to distinguish them from the “deformations”
of the current literature.

The representation of physical systems via RHM requires [1c,4h] the
knowledge of two quantities: the Hamiltonian H for the representation of
all potential interactions; and the isotopic generalization of the conventional
unit I = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) of RQM, called isounit, ˆI = Diag(n1

2) ×
ˆΓ(x, ˙x, ψ, ∂ψ, . . .) = ˆI † > 0, where n1
2 represent extended, non-
spherical and deformable shapes of the nucleons under the volume preserving
2 represents the density of the medium in
condition n1
which motion occurs (e.g., the square of the local index of refraction), and ˆΓ
represent all nonlinear, nonlocal and nonpotential interactions.

The isotopic lifting of the basic (multiplicative) unit I → ˆI requires, for
consistency, the corresponding lifting of the conventional associative product
A × B of RQM into the isoproduct A ˆ×B = A × ˆT × B, ˆI = ˆT −1, under
which ˆI is the correct left and right unit of the new theory, ˆI ˆ×A ≡ A ˆ× ˆI ≡ A
[4a]. The totality of the products of RHM must therefore be isotopic for
consistency.

A realization of RHM speciﬁcally conceived for the nuclear structure is
presented in the adjoining paper [1c]. In essence, RQM can be reconstructed
with respect to the new isounit ˆI with isoproduct A ˆ×B via the use of nonuni-
tary transforms. In fact, for U × U † 6= I, the isounit is precisely given by the
transform I → ˆI = U × I × U † = ˆI † , the isoproduct is precisely given by the
transform A × B → U × A × B × U † = ˆA × ˆT × ˆB = ˆA ˆ× ˆB, ˆA = U × A × U †,
ˆB = U ×B ×U †, ˆT = (U ×U †)−1 = ˆI −1, the fundamental relativistic commu-

The reader should be aware that the above procedure implies: new ﬁeld

isometric ˆNµν = ˆηµν × ˆI = ˆT α
and isoseparation (x − y)ˆ2 = [(x − y)µ ˆηµν(x − y)ν] × ˆI ∈ ˆR; a new image
ˆP (3.1) of the Poincar´e symmetry ﬁrst introduced by Santilli [4d-4f] under
the name of iso-Poincar´e symmetry; new isofunctional analysis [5c,5e]; etc.
For the reconstruction in isospaces over isoﬁelds of all axiomatic properties of
RQM, such as hermiticity, real-valuedness of Hermitean operators, linearity,
locality, unitarity, etc., we are forced to refer the reader to ref. [1c,4h].

We merely recall here that ˆP (3.1) is the image of P (3.1) for the new unit
ˆI . As such, ˆP (3.1) is the universal invariance of the isoseparation (x − y)ˆ2,
that is, of a geometry whose unit ˆI directly represents extended, nonspherical
and deformable particles under unrestricted, generally nonunitary external
forces. As such, computer visualization of ˆP (3.1) show the desired removal
of the Keplerian center, as assured by the presence of contact/zero-range
interactions.

We should also recall that RHM is characterized by new degrees of free-
dom of RQM axioms which are given for constant ˆI = n2 by the Hilbert
space law < φ| × |ψ > ×I ≡< φ| × n−2 × |ψ > ×n2 =< φ| × ˆI × ψ > × ˆI with
Minkowskian counterpart x2 = (xµ ×ηµν ×xν) ×I ≡ (xµ ×(n−2 ×ηµν) ×xν) ×
n2 = (xµ × ˆηµν × xν) × ˆI . Note that these new invariances have remained
undetected during this century because they required the prior discivery of
new numbers with arbitrary units ˆI [4c].

Also, RHM provides an explicit and concrete “operator” realization of the
“hidden variables” λ = ˆT (x, ˆψ, . . .) via the isoeigenvalue equation ˆH ˆ×| ˆψ >=
ˆH × λ × | ˆψ >= ˆE ˆ×| ˆψ >= (E × λ−1) × λ × | ˆψ >= E × | ˆψ > . As such,
RHM is a form of “completion” of RQM much along the celebrated argument
by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen for which von Neumann’s theorem, Bell’s
inequalities and all that do not apply owing to the underlying nonunitary
structure (see [1c,4h] for details).

An important property is that (for positive-deﬁnite isounits) all isotopic

6

structures are locally isomorphic to the original ones, ˆF ≈ F , ˆH ≈ H,
ˆM ≈ M, ˆP (3.1) ≈ P (3.1), etc., and they coincide at the abstract, realization-
free level by conception and construction. Possible criticisms on the ax-
iomatic structure of RHM (generally due to lack of suﬃcient technical knowl-
edge of this new ﬁeld) are therefore criticisms on the axiomatic structure of
RQM. In fact, RHM is not a new mechanics, but merely a new realization
of the abstract axioms of RQM, although the two realizations are physically
inequivalent because connected by nonunitary transforms.

The reader should be aware that RHM admits a hierarchy of realiza-
tions to represent a hiererchy of physical conditions of increasing complexity,
ranging from the minimal conditions of mutual overlapping of hadrons in
the nuclear structure, to their maximal conditions of mutual penetration in
the interior of collapsing stars. The realization needed for nuclear physics is
constructed for the ﬁrst time in the adjoint paper [1c], and it is conceived to
preserve conventional quantum laws. In fact, we have the conventional un-
2 < ˆψ| × ˆT × ˆI × ˆT | ˆψ > / < ˆψ| × ˆT × | ˆψ >=
certainties ∆ˆr∆ˆp ≥ 1
2 < [ˆp, ˆx] = 1
1
2 (¯h = 1); the conventional spin 1
2 and related Pauli’s exclusion principle; and
other conventional laws. Note that this implies the preservation by RHM
of causality under nonlocal interactions (because they are embedded in the
unit), the validity of the superposition principle for a highly nonlinear theory
(because of the reconstruction of linearity in isospace), the invariance under
nonunitary time evolutions (because they are reduced to the isounitary law
W = ˆW × ˆT 1/2 , W × W † ≡ ˆW ˆ× ˆW † = ˆW † ˆ× ˆW = ˆI 6= I), and other features
[1c,4h] which are impossible for the conventional formalism of RQM.

Above all, RHM is based on the requirement of preserving the axioms
of the SR and merely realize them in isospace ˆM under the isosymmetry ˆP
(3.1) [4]. This permits to extend the applicability of the SR from the current
restriction to elm waves or perfectly spherical and rigid bodies moving in
vacuum with maximal speed c0, to elm waves or nonspherical-deformable
bodies moving within physical media with maximal speed c = c0/n4.
In
particular, the maximal causal speed on ˆM remains c0 because in the fourth
2,
component of the isotopic line element we have the lifting c0
with the inverse lifting of the related unit I44 = I → ˆI44 = n4
2, under which
the conventional value c0 is invariant, thus rendering the SR universal [4h].
Nowadays RHM possesses several preliminary, yet numerical and signiﬁ-
cant veriﬁcations in nuclear physics, particle physics, astrophysics, supercon-
ductivity, biology and other ﬁelds which we cannot possibly review here for

4 Exact representation of total nuclear

magnetic moments

As indicated earlier, total nuclear magnetic moments still lack an exact rep-
resentation via RQM after three-quarter of a century of studies. For instance,
for the deuteron we have the value ˆµexp
D = 0.857, while: quantum mechanics
yields the value µtheor
QM = 0.880 which is 2.6 % oﬀ in excess [2a]; all possible
corrections via RQM still remain with about 1 % oﬀ [2b]; and the problem
does not appear to be solvable via quark models because the quark orbits
are too small to yield the needed deviation.

The most plausible explanation of the above occurrence was formulated
by the Founding Fathers of nuclear physics in the late 1940’s [2a]. Recall
that nucleons are not point like, but have extended charge distributions with
the radius of about 1 fm. Since perfectly rigid bodies do not exist in nature,
the above “historical hypothesis” (as hereon referred to) assumes that such
distributions can be deformed under suﬃcient external forces. But the de-
formation of a charged and spinning sphere implies a necessary alteration of
its intrinsic magnetic moment. In turn, this permits the exact representation
of total nuclear magnetic moments as shown below.

Our fundamental assumption is that the exact representation of total nu-
clear magnetic moments requires the lifting RQM → RHM, with basic lifting
P (3.1) → ˆP (3.1). As recalled earlier, the intrinsic characteristics of nucleons
are perennial and immutable under P (3.1), while ˆP (3.1) has been constructed
precisely to represent their alterability under suﬃcient conditions.

One of the ﬁrst experimental veriﬁcations of RHM is then the exact-

numerical representation of total nuclear magnetic moments.
sented for the ﬁrst time in ref.
[6] under a joint mutation of angular mo-
mentum and spin. In this note we give a new representation under mutated
magnetic moments but conventional values of angular momentum and spin.
The fundamental equation of RHM needed for quantitative treatment
of the historical hypothesis is the isotopic image of Dirac’s equation, called
iso-Dirac equation [4h].
It is characterized by a nonunitary image of the
conventional equation and can be written for total 6-dimensional isounits

n4 (of value generally diﬀerent than 1); and c) under conventional electro-
magnetic interactions plus unrestricted external forces (represented by ˆΓ).
When a system is considered from the exterior, all nonlocal-nonpotential in-
ternal eﬀects must evidently be averaged into constants (due to their short
range character), as it is the case for total nuclear magnetic moments. This
yields a mere isorenormalization of the nµ’s hereon tacitly implied.

2 × n2

It is easy to see that iso-Dirac equation (1) preserves the conventional
eigenvalues of angular momentum and spin due to its very construction via
nonunitary transform of conventional equations (see [1c] for details), while
providing the desired mutation of the magnetic moment of nucleons [4b,6,1b]

ˆµN = µN × n4/n3 , N = n or p .

(2)

The application to the exact representation of total nuclear magnetic
moments is straightforward. Assume to a good approximation that protons
and neutrons have the same shape (nkn = nkp) and that they move in the
same medium (n4n = n4p). Then, a simple isotopy of the QM model [2a]
yields the RHM model for the total nuclear magnetic moments

exp is exactly represented by merely assuming that the
charge distribution of the nucleons in the deuteron experiences a deformation
of shape of about 1/2 %. Note that the mutation is of prolate character which
implies a decrease of the (absolute value of the) intrinsic magnetic moment of
nucleons exactly as needed. Note also that the representation is of geometric
character; it is independent from any assumed nucleon constituent; and it
identiﬁes the polarization of the constituent orbits which is needed for their
compliance with physical reality. Corrections due to the value n4 6= 1 for
the deuteron are of 2-nd or higher order (due to the relatively large nucleon
distace in the deuteron).

The application of the model (3) to the exact representation of the total
magnetic moment of tritium, helium and other nuclei is straightforward and
studied in a future work.

Note that, the mutation of the charge distribution of the nucleons is not
a universal constant, because it depends on the local conditions, thus being
generally diﬀerent for diﬀerent nuclei. This illustrates the need of having
inﬁnitely possible diﬀerent isounits ˆI.

5 The basic principle for possible new

recycling of nuclear waste

RHM in its nuclear realization [1c] and the fundamental iso-Poincar´e sym-
metry [4c-4f] predict the possible mutation not only of the intrinsic magnetic
moment of the neutron, but also of its meanlife, to such an extent that the
former implies the latter and vice versa (as one can see via the use of the
isoboosts). In turn, the control of the meanlife of the neutron de facto implies
new means for recycling the nuclear waste.

10

In this respect, the ﬁrst physical reality which should be noted and admit-
ted is that total nuclear magnetic moments constitute experimental evidence
on the alterability of the intrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons.

The second physical reality which should be noted and admitted is that,
by no means, the neutron has a constant and universal meanlife, because
it possesses a meanlife of the order of seconds when belonging to certain
nuclei with rapid beta decays, a meanlife of the order of 15 minutes when in
vacuum, a meanlife of the order of days, weeks and years when belonging to
other nuclei, all the way to an inﬁnite meanlife for stable nuclei.

Once the above occurrences are admitted, basic principle for possible new
recycling of nuclear waste is the “stimulated neutron decay” (SND) consist-
ing of resonating or other subnuclear mechanisms suitable to stimulate its
beta decay. Among the various possibilities under study, we quote here the
possible gamma stimulated neutron decay (GSND) according to the reaction
[7b]

γ + n → p+ + e− + ¯ν ,

(5)

which is predicted by RQM to have a very small (and therefore practically
insigniﬁcant) cross section as a function of the energy, but which is instead
predicted by RHM to have a resonating peak in said cross section at the value
of 1.294 MeV (corresponding to 3.129 × 1020 Hz). As such, the above mech-
anism is of subnuclear character, in the sense of occurring in the structure
of the neutron, rather than in the nuclear structure, the latter merely im-
plying possible reﬁnements of the resonating frequency due to the (relatively
smaller) nuclear binding energy [7b].

When stable elements are considered, the above GSND is admitted only
in certain instances, evidently when the transition is compatible with all
conventional laws. This is the case for the isotope Mo(100,42) which, under
the GSND, would transform via beta emission into the Te(100,43) which, in
turn, is naturally unstable and beta decays into Ru(100,44). For a number
of additional admissible elements see [7b].

The point important for this note is that the GSND is predicted to be
admissible for large and unstable nuclei as occurring in the nuclear waste.
The possible new form of recycling submitted for study in this note is given
by bombarding the radioactive waste with a beam of photons of the needed
excitation frequency and of the maximal possible intensity. Such a beam

11

would cause an instantaneous excess of peripheral protons in the waste nu-
clei with their consequential decay due to instantaneous excess of Coulomb
repulsive forces.

It should be stressed that this note can only address the basic principle of
the GSND. Once experimentally established (see next section), the recycling
requires evident additional technological studies on the equipment suitable
to produce the photon beam in the desired frequency and intensity, eg., via
synchrotron radiation or other mechanisms [7e].

The important point is that equipment of the above nature is expected to
be deﬁnitely smaller in size, weight and cost than large particle accelerators.
As such, the recycling is expected to verify the basic requirement of usability
by the nuclear power companies in their own plants.

A novelty of this note is that the study of recycling mechanisms is specif-
ically restricted to the subnuclear level. A virtually endless number of pos-
sibilities exist for the reduction of the meanlife of the waste via mechanisms
of nuclear type. Among them we note mechanisms based on RQM, such
[8b], Barker [8c] and others,
as those by Shaﬀer et al.
as well as new nuclear mechanisms predicted by RHM and currently under
additional patenting. The understanding is that, to maximize the eﬃciency,
the ﬁnal equipment is expected to be a combination of various means of both
subnuclear and nuclear character.

[8a], Marriot et al.

As a ﬁnal comment, the reader should be aware that any new recycling
of nuclear waste is unavoidably linked to possible new sources of energy. In
spont
fact, the GSND γres + Mo(100, 42) stim→ Tc(100, 43) + β
→ Ru(100, 44) + β
is de facto a potential new source of subnuclear energy (releasing the rather
large amount of about 5 MeV plus the energy of the γres per nucleus) called
hadronic energy [7b-7g]. It should be noted that, it conﬁrmed, the new energy
would not release harmful radiations, would not imply radioactive waste,
would not require heavy shield or critical mass, and would be realizable in
large or minuterized forms, thus having ample prerequisites for additional
studies.

6 Needed basic experiments

The continuation of quantitative scientiﬁc studies on the proposed new recy-
cling of the nuclear waste (as well as on possible subnuclear forms of clean

12

energy) beyond the level of personal views one way or another, requires the
following three basic experiments, all of moderate cost and fully realizable
with current technology.

1. Finalize the interferometric 4π spinorial symmetry measures
[9]. Preliminary direct experimental measures on the alterability of the in-
trinsic magnetic moments of nucleons were conducted from 1975 to 1979 by
H. Rauch and his associates [9a-9e] via interferometic measures of the 4π
spinorial symmetry of the neutron. The best available measures [9e] dating
back to 1979 indicate about 1% deviations from 720◦. But such deviation
is smaller than the error, and the measures are therefore undeﬁned. Similar
unsettled measures were conducted by Werner and his associates [9f] in the
mid 1970’s.

The above measures are manifestly fundamental for possible new forms
of recycling as well as for possible new forms of subnuclear energy. In fact,
they would provide experimental evidence on possible deviations from the
Poincar´e symmetry in favor of our covering iso-Poincar´e form [4]. This is
due to the fact that, if conﬁrmed, the measures would establish a deviation
from the fundamental spinorial transformation law of favor of the mutated
form easily derivable from Eqs. (1) (ﬁrst identiﬁed in [6], see [1c] for a recent
derivation)

ˆψ′ = ˆR(θ3) ˆ× ˆψ = eiγ1γ2 ˆθ3/2 × ˆψ ,

ˆθ = θ/n1 × n2 ,

(6)

As an illustration, assume a 1% deviation from 720◦. The isotopies re-
construct the exact SU(2)-spin in isospace, thus requiring ˆθ = θ/n1 × n2 =
720◦ [4h]. This yields

n1

2 = n2

2 = 713◦/720◦ = 0.990 , n3

2 = 1.020 ,

(7a)

ˆµ/µ = n4/n3 ≈ 713◦/720◦ , n4 = n3 × 713◦/714◦ = 1.000 ,

(7b)

namely, our iso-Dirac equation provides an exact-numerical representation of
the 4π interferometric measures, by deriving the value n4 = 1 occurring in
vacuum, as it is the case for the neutrons of tests [9] (but only approximately
so for the deuteron). For more details see [1c].

Once, in addition to the evidence from total nuclear magnetic moments
and various other applications [4,5], the validity of the iso-Poincar´e symme-

13

try is established via direct experiments for the mutation of the intrinsic
magnetic moment of the neutron, that of its meanlife is expected to be con-
sequential.

2. Repeat don Borghi’s experiment [7f] on the apparent syn-
thesis of the neutron from protons and electrons only. Despite mo-
mentous advances, we still miss fundamental experimental knowledge on the
structure of the neutron, e.g., on how the neutron is synthesized from protons
and electrons only in young stars solely composed of hydrogen (where quark
models cannot be used owing to the lack of the remaining members of the
baryonic octet, and weak interactions do not provide suﬃcient information
on the structure problem).

The synthesis occurs according to the reaction p+ + e− → n + ν which:
is the “inverse” of the stimulated decay (5); is predicted by RQM to have
a very small cross section as a function of the energy; while the same cross
section is predicted by RHM to have a peak at the threshold energy of 0.80
MeV in singlet p-e coupling [4f].

The possible synthesis of the neutron has a fundamental relevance for
waste recycling, besides other industrial applications. If the electron “dis-
appears” at the creation of the neutron as in current theoretical views, the
GSND becomes of diﬃcult if not impossible realization.

However, the electron is a permanent and stable particle. As such, doubts
as to whether it can “disappear” date back to Rutherford’s very conception
of the neutron as a “compressed hydrogen atom” [7a]. As well known, RQM
does not permit such a representation of the neutron structure on numer-
ous counts. Nevertheless, the covering RHM has indeed achieved an exact-
numerical representation of all characteristics of the neutron according to
Rutherford’s original conception [4f]. The novelty is that, when immersed
within the hyperdense proton, the electron experiences a mutation e− → ˆe−
of its intrinsic characteristics (becoming a quark ?) including its rest en-
ergy (because n4 6= 1 inside the proton, thus Eˆe = mc2 + mec0
2) . The
excitation energy of 1.294 MeV is predicted by our covering iso-Poincar´e
symmetry under the condition of recovering all characteristics of the neu-
tron for the model n = (p+
↓ )RHM , including its primary decay for which
ˆe− → e− + ¯ν [4f].

A preliminary experimental veriﬁcation of the synthesize the neutron in
laboratory was done by don Borghi’s and his associates [7d]. Since experi-

14

ments can be conﬁrmed or dismissed solely via other experiments and cer-
tainly not via theoretical beliefs one way or the other, don Borghi’s experi-
ment must be run again. The test can be repeated either as originally done
[7f], or in a number of alternative ways, e.g., by hitting with a cathodic ray of
0.80 MeV a mass of beryllium saturated with hydrogen, put at low temper-
ature and subjected to an intense electric ﬁeld to maximize the p-e singlet
coupling. The detection of neutrons emanating from such a set-up would
establish their synthesis.

3. Complete Tsagas’ experiment [7g] on the stimulated neutron
decay. The last and most fundamental information needed for additional
quantitative studies is the veriﬁcation or disproof of the GSND at the res-
onating gamma frequency of 1.294 MeV.

The latter experiment has been initiated by N. Tsagas and his associates
It consists of a disk of the radioisotope Eu152 (emitting gammas of
[7g].
1.3 MeV) placed parallel and close to a disk of an element admitting of the
GSND, such as the Mo(100,42) (or a sample of nuclear waste). The detection
of electrons with at least 2 MeV emanating from the system would establish
the principle of the GSND (because such electrons can only be of subnu-
clear origin, Compton electrons being of at most 1 MeV). The detection via
mass spectrography of traces of the extremely rare Ru(100,44) after suﬃ-
cient running time would conﬁrm said principle. The practical realization of
the proposed form of waste recycling would then be shifted to the industrial
development and production of a photon beam of the needed frequency and
intensity.

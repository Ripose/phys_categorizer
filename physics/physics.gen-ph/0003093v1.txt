Introduction to new

Hierarchic theory of condensed matter

(http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/00030044)

A basically new hierarchic quantitative theory, general for solids

and liquids, has been developed.

It is assumed, that unharmonic oscillations of particles in any con-
densed matter lead to emergence of three-dimensional (3D) superpo-
sition of standing de Broglie waves of molecules, electromagnetic and
acoustic waves. Consequently, any condensed matter could be con-
sidered as a gas of 3D standing waves of corresponding nature. Our
approach uniﬁes and develops strongly the Einstein’s and Debye’s
models.

Collective excitations, like 3D standing de Broglie waves of molecules,

representing at certain conditions the mesoscopic molecular Bose con-
densate, were analyzed, as a background of hierarchic model of con-
densed matter.

The most probable de Broglie wave (wave B) length is deter-
mined by the ratio of Plank constant to the most probable impulse
of molecules, or by ratio of its most probable phase velocity to fre-
quency. The waves B are related to molecular translations (tr) and
librations (lb).

As the quantum dynamics of condensed matter does not follow in general
case the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the real most probable de
Broglie wave length can exceed the classical thermal de Broglie wave length and
the distance between centers of molecules many times.

This makes possible the atomic and molecular Bose condensation in solids
and liquids at temperatures, below boiling point. It is one of the most important
results of new theory, which we have conﬁrmed by computer simulations on
examples of water and ice.

Four strongly interrelated new types of quasiparticles (collective excita-

tions) were introduced in our hierarchic model:

2

1. Eﬀectons (tr and lb), existing in ”acoustic” (a) and ”optic” (b) states

represent the coherent clusters in general case;

2. Convertons, corresponding to interconversions between tr and lb types of

the eﬀectons (ﬂickering clusters);

3. Transitons are the intermediate [a ⇋ b] transition states of the tr and lb

eﬀectons;

4. Deformons are the 3D superposition of IR electromagnetic or acoustic

waves, activated by transitons and convertons.

Primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are formed by 3D superposition of the
most probable standing de Broglie waves of the oscillating ions, atoms or
molecules. The volume of eﬀectons (tr and lb) may contain from less than one,
to tens and even thousands of molecules. The ﬁrst condition means validity
of classical approximation in description of the subsystems of the eﬀectons.
The second one points to quantum properties of coherent clusters due to
molecular Bose condensation.

The liquids are semiclassical systems because their primary (tr) eﬀectons
contain less than one molecule and primary (lb) eﬀectons - more than one
molecule. The solids are quantum systems totally because both kind of their
primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are molecular Bose condensates. These conse-
quences of our theory are conﬁrmed by computer calculations.

The 1st order [gas → liquid] transition is accompanied by strong decreasing
of rotational (librational) degrees of freedom due to emergence of primary (lb)
eﬀectons and [liquid → solid] transition - by decreasing of translational degrees
of freedom due to Bose-condensation of primary (tr) eﬀectons.

In the general case the eﬀecton can be approximated by par-
allelepiped with edges corresponding to de Broglie waves length in
three selected directions (1, 2, 3), related to the symmetry of the
molecular dynamics. In the case of isotropic molecular motion the
eﬀectons’ shape may be approximated by cube.

The edge-length of primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) can be considered

as the ”parameter of order”.

The in-phase oscillations of molecules in the eﬀectons correspond to the
eﬀecton’s (a) - acoustic state and the counterphase oscillations correspond to
their (b) - optic state. States (a) and (b) of the eﬀectons diﬀer in potential
energy only, however, their kinetic energies, impulses and spatial dimensions -
are the same. The b-state of the eﬀectons has a common feature with Fr¨olich’s
polar mode.

The (a → b) or (b → a) transition states of the primary eﬀectons
(tr and lb), deﬁned as primary transitons, are accompanied by a
change in molecule polarizability and dipole moment without density
ﬂuctuations. At this case they lead to absorption or radiation of IR
photons, respectively.

Superposition (interception) of three internal standing IR pho-
tons of diﬀerent directions (1,2,3) - forms primary electromagnetic
deformons (tr and lb).

3

On the other hand, the [lb⇋ tr] convertons and secondary transitons are
accompanied by the density ﬂuctuations, leading to absorption or radiation of
phonons.

Superposition resulting from interception of standing phonons in three direc-

tions (1,2,3), forms secondary acoustic deformons (tr and lb).

Correlated collective excitations of primary and secondary eﬀectons and
deformons (tr and lb), localized in the volume of primary tr and lb electromag-
netic deformons, lead to origination of macroeﬀectons, macrotransitons
and macrodeformons (tr and lb respectively).

Correlated simultaneous excitations of tr and lb macroeﬀectons in the vol-
ume of superimposed tr and lb electromagnetic deformons lead to origination
of supereﬀectons.

In turn, the coherent excitation of both:

tr and lb macrodeformons and
macroconvertons in the same volume means creation of superdeformons. Su-
perdeformons are the biggest (cavitational) ﬂuctuations, leading to microbub-
bles in liquids and to local defects in solids.

Total number of quasiparticles of condensed matter equal to 4!=24,
reﬂects all of possible combinations of the four basic ones [1-4], intro-
duced above. This set of collective excitations in the form of ”gas” of
3D standing waves of three types: de Broglie, acoustic and electro-
magnetic - is shown to be able to explain virtually all the properties
of all condensed matter.

The important positive feature of our hierarchic model of matter is that it
does not need the semi-empiric intermolecular potentials for calculations, which
are unavoidable in existing theories of many body systems. The potential energy
of intermolecular interaction is involved indirectly in dimensions and stability
of quasiparticles, introduced in our model.

The main formulae of theory are the same for liquids and solids
and include following experimental parameters, which take into ac-
count their diﬀerent properties:

[1]- Positions of (tr) and (lb) bands in oscillatory spectra;
[2]- Sound velocity;
[3]- Density;
[4]- Refraction index (extrapolated to the inﬁnitive wave length of

photon).

The knowledge of these four basic parameters at the same temperature and
pressure makes it possible using our computer program, to evaluate more than
300 important characteristics of any condensed matter. Among them are such
as: total internal energy, kinetic and potential energies, heat-capacity and ther-
mal conductivity, surface tension, vapor pressure, viscosity, coeﬃcient of self-
diﬀusion, osmotic pressure, solvent activity, etc. Most of calculated parameters
are hidden, i.e. inaccessible to direct experimental measurement.

The new interpretation and evaluation of Brillouin light scattering and
M¨ossbauer eﬀect parameters may also be done on the basis of hierarchic the-
ory. Mesoscopic scenarios of turbulence, superconductivity and superﬂuity are

4

elaborated.

Some original aspects of water in organization and large-scale dynamics of
biosystems - such as proteins, DNA, microtubules, membranes and regulative
role of water in cytoplasm, cancer development, quantum neurodynamics, etc.
have been analyzed in the framework of Hierarchic theory.

Computerized veriﬁcation of our Hierarchic concept of matter on
examples of water and ice is performed, using special computer pro-
gram: Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP, copy-
right, 1997, Kaivarainen). The new optoacoustic device, based on this
program, with possibilities much wider, than that of IR, Raman and
Brillouin spectrometers, has been proposed ( http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk
[CAMP]).

This is the ﬁrst theory able to predict all known experimental
temperature anomalies for water and ice. The conformity between
theory and experiment is very good even without any adjustable pa-
rameters.

The hierarchic concept creates a bridge between micro- and macro-
liquids and solids in

phenomena, dynamics and thermodynamics,
terms of quantum physics.

==============================================================

1. Role of inter-domain water clusters in large-scale dynamics of

proteins

The functioning of proteins, namely antibodies, enzymes, is caused
by the physicochemical properties, geometry and dynamics of their
active sites. The mobility of an active site is related to the dynamics
of the residual part of a protein molecule, its hydration shell and the
properties of a free solvent.

The dynamic model of a protein proposed in 1975 and supported
nowadays with numerous data (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen, 1985, 1989b), is based on
the following statements:

1. A protein molecule contains one or more cavities or clefts ca-
pable to large scale ﬂuctuations - pulsations between two states:
”closed” (A) and ”open” (B) with lesser and bigger accessibility to
water.

The frequency of pulsations (νA⇔B):

104s−1 ≤ νA⇔B ≤ 107s−1

depends on the structure of protein, its ligand state, temperature and
solvent viscosity. Transitions between A and B states are the result of

5

the relative displacements of protein domains and subunits forming
the cavities;

2. The water, interacting with protein, consists of two main frac-

tions.

The 1st major fraction, which solvates the outer surface regions of
protein has less apparent cooperative properties than the 2nd minor
fraction conﬁned to ”open” cavities. Water molecules, interacting
with the cavity in the ”open” (B)-state form a cooperative cluster,
whose lifetime (≥ 10−10s−1). Properties of clusters are determined by
the geometry, mobility and polarity of the cavity, as well as by tem-
perature and pressure.

It is seen from X-ray structural data that the protein cavities: active sites
(AS), other interdomain clefts, the space between subunits of oligomeric pro-
teins, have a high nonpolar residues content.
In contrast to the small intra
domain holes isolated from the outer medium, which sometimes contain several
H2O molecules, the interdomain and intersubunit cavities can contain several
dozens of molecules (Fig. 1), exchanging with bulk water.

The development of the above dynamic model has lead us to the
following classiﬁcation of dynamics in the native globular proteins.

1. Small-scale (SS) dynamics:
low amplitude (≤ 1 ˚A) thermal ﬂuctuations of atoms, aminoacids residues,
and displacements of α-helixes and β-structures within domains and subunits,
at which the eﬀective Stokes radius of domains does not change. This
type of motion, related to domain stability, can diﬀer in the content of A and
B conformers (Fig. 1, dashed line). The range of characteristic times at SS
dynamics is (10−4 −10−11)s, determined by activation energies of corresponding
transitions.

2. Large-scale (LS) dynamics:
is subdivided into LS-pulsations and LS-librations with a character

of limited diﬀusion of domains and subunits of proteins:

LS- pulsations are represented by relative translational-rotational displace-
ments of domains and subunits at distances ≥ 3˚A. Thus, the cavities, which are
formed by domains, ﬂuctuate between states with less (A) and more (B) water-
accessibility. The life-times of these states depending on protein structure and

external conditions are in the limits of (cid:0)10−4 − 10−7(cid:1) s.

In accordance to our model, one of contributions to this time is determined
by frequency of excitations of [lb/tr] macroconvertons. The frequency of
macroconvertons excitation at normal conditions is about 107 (1/s).

The pulsation frequency of big multi-subunit oligomeric proteins of about
104 (1/s) could be related to stronger ﬂuctuations of water cluster in their central
cavity like macrodeformons or even superdeformons (Fig.3c,d).

The life-times of (A) and (B) conformer markedly exceeds the time of tran-

sitions between them ≃ (10−9 − 10−11) s.

The (A ⇔ B) pulsations of various cavities in proteins could be correlated.
The corresponding A and B conformers have diﬀerent Stokes radii and eﬀective

6

volume.

The geometrical deformation of the inter-subunits large central cavity of
oligomeric proteins and the destabilization of the water cluster located in it
lead to relaxational change of (A ⇔ B) equilibrium constant:

KA⇔B = exp(cid:18)−

GA − GB

RT

(cid:19) .

The dashed line means that the stability and the small-scale dynamics of do-
mains and subunits in the content of A and B conformers can diﬀer from
each other. The [A ⇔ B] pulsations are accompanied by reversible sorption-
desorption of (20 − 50) H2O molecules from the cavities.

Structural domains are space-separated formations with a mass of (1 − 2) ·
103 D. Protein subunits (M M ≥ 2 · 103D), as a rule, consist of 2 or more
domains. The domains can consist only of α or only of β-structure or have no
like secondary structure at all (Schulz, Schirmer, 1979).

The shift of A ⇔ B equilibrium of central cavity of oligomeric proteins

determines their cooperative properties during consecutive ligand binding in

the active sites. Signal transmission from the active sites to the remote regions

of macromolecules is also dependent on (A ⇔ B) equilibrium.

Fig. 1. Examples of large-scale (LS) protein dynamics: A ⇔ B

pulsations and librations with correlation times (τ B
1985, 1989):

lb < τ A

lb ) (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen,

a) mobility of domains connected by ﬂexible hinge or contact

region, like in the light chains of immunoglobulins;

b) mobility of domains that form the active sites of proteins, like
in hexokinase, papain, pepsin, lysozyme etc. due to ﬂexibility of
contacts;

7

c) mobility of subunits forming the oligomeric proteins like hemoglobin.

Besides transitions of the active sites of each subunit, the (A ⇔ B)
pulsations with frequencies of (104 − 106) s−1 are pertinent to the
common central cavity.

b) librations represent the relative rotational - translational mo-
tions of domains and subunits in composition of A and B conformers
with correlation times τM ≃ (1 − 5) · 10−8s.

LS - librations of domains are accompanied by ”ﬂickering” of water
cluster in the open cavity between domains or subunits. The process
of water cluster ”ﬂickering”, i.e.
[dissociation ⇋association] is close
to the reversible ﬁrst-order phase transition, when:

∆GH2O = ∆HH2O − T ∆SH2O ≈ 0

Such type of transitions in water-macromolecular systems could
be responsible for so called ”enthalpy-entropy compensation eﬀects”
(Lumry and Biltonen, 1969).

The ”ﬂickering clusters” means excitation of [lb/tr] conversions be-
tween librational and translational primary water eﬀectons, accom-
panied by [association/dissociation] of coherent water cluster (see dif-
ference in dimensions of lb and tr eﬀectons on Fig. 18a, b of [1]).

The water cluster (primary lb eﬀecton) association and dissocia-
tion in protein cavities in terms of mesoscopic model represent the
(ac) - convertons or (bc) - convertons. These excitations stimulate the
LS- librations of domains in composition of B-conformer. The fre-
quencies of (ac) and (bc) convertons, has the order of about 108c−1.
This value coincides well with experimental characteristic times for
protein domains librations.

The (ac) and (bc) convertons represent transitions between similar
states of primary librational and translational eﬀectons: [alb ⇋ atr] and
[blb ⇋ btr] (see Introduction to[1, 2]).

For the other hand, the Macroconvertons, representing simultane-
ous excitation of (ac + bc) convertons, are responsible for [B ⇋ A] large-
scale pulsations of proteins.

The librational mobility of domains and subunits is revealed by the fact that
M ) calculated on

the experimental value of τM is less than the theoretical one (τ t
the Stokes-Einstein formula:

τ t
M = (V /k) · η/T

This formula is based on the assumption that the whole protein can be
approximated by a rigid sphere. It means, that the large-scale dynamics can be

8

characterized by the ”ﬂexibility factor”, in the absence of aggregation equal to
ratio:

f l = (τM /τ t

M ) ≤ 1

Antonchenko (1986) has demonstrated, using the Monte-Carlo method for sim-
ulations, that the disjoining pressure of a liquid in the pores onto the walls
changes periodically depending on the distance (L) between the limiting sur-
faces. If the water molecules are approximated by rigid globes, then the maxima
of the wedging pressure lie on the values of distance L: 9.8; 7; and 3.3˚A. It points,
that small changes in the geometry of cavities can lead to signiﬁcant changes in
their A ⇔ B equilibrium constant (KA⇔B).

According to our model the large-scale transition of the protein cavity from

the ”open” B-state to the ”closed” A-state consists of the following stages:

1. Small reorientation (libration) of domains or subunits, which form an
”open” cavity (B-state). This process is induced by (ac) or (bc) convertons of
water librational eﬀecton, localized in cavity (ﬂickering of water cluster);

2. Cavitational ﬂuctuation of water cluster, containing (20−50) H2O molecules

and the destabilization of the B-state of cavity as a result of [lb⇋tr] macro-
converton excitation;

3. Collapsing of a cavity during the time about 10−10 s, dependent on pre-
vious stage and concomitant rapid structural change in the hinge region of
interdomain and intersubunit contacts: [B → A] transition.

The b → a transition of one of the protein cavities can be followed by similar

or the opposite A → B transition of the other cavity in the macromolecule.

It should be noted that the collapsing time of a cavitation bubble with the
radius: r ≃ (10 − 15)˚A in bulk water and collapsing time of interdomain cavity
are of the same order: ∆t ˜10−10s under normal conditions (Shutilov, 1980).

If conﬁgurational changes of macromolecules at B → A and A → B transi-
tions are suﬃciently quick and occur as a jumps of the eﬀective volume, they
accompanied by appearance of the shock acoustic waves in the bulk medium.

When the cavitational ﬂuctuation of water in the ”open” cavity does not
occur, then (b → a) or (B → A) transitions are slower processes, determined
by continuous diﬀusion of domains and subunits. This happens when [lb → tr]
macroconvertons are not excited.

In their review, Karplus and McCammon (1986) analyzed data on alco-
holdehydrogenase, myoglobin and ribonuclease, which have been obtained using
molecular dynamics approach.
It has been shown that large-scale reorienta-
tion of domains occur together with their deformation and motions of α and β
structures.

It has been shown also (Karplus and McCammon, 1986) that activation
free energies, necessary for [A ⇔ B] transitions and the reorganization of hinge
region between domains, do not exceed (3-4) kcal/mole. Such low values were
obtained for proteins with even rather dense interdomain region, as seen from
X-ray data. The authors explain such low values of activation energy by the

9

fact that the displacement of atoms, necessary for such transition, does not
exceed 0.5 ˚A, i.e. they are comparable with the usual amplitudes of atomic
oscillation at temperatures 20 − 300C. It means that they occur very quickly
within times of 10−12 s, i.e. much less than the times of [A → B] or [B → A]
domain displacements (10−9 − 10−10s). Therefore, the high frequency small-
scale dynamics of hinge is responsible for the quick adaptation of hinge geometry
to the changing distance between the domains and for decreasing the total
activation energy of [A ⇔ B] pulsations of proteins,.

Recent calculations by means of molecular dynamics reveal that the oscilla-
tions in proteins are harmonic at the low temperature (T< 220K) only. At the
physiological temperatures the oscillations are strongly unharmonic,
collective, global and their amplitude increases with hydration (Stein-
back et al., 1996). Water is a ”catalyzer” of protein unharmonic
dynamics.

It is obvious, that both small-scale (SS) and large-scale (LS) dy-
namics, introduced in our model, are necessary for protein function.
To characterize quantitatively the LS dynamics of proteins, we pro-
posed the uniﬁed Stokes-Einstein and Eyring-Polany equation.

2. Description of large-scale dynamics of proteins, based on

generalized Stokes-Einstein and Eyring-Polany equation

In the case of the continuous Brownian diﬀusion of a particle, the rate

constant of diﬀusion is determined by the Stokes-Einstein law:

k =

1
τ

=

kBT
V η

(1)

where: τ is correlation time, i.e. the time, necessary for rotation of a particle
by the mean angle determined as ¯ϕ ≈ 0.5 of the turn or the characteristic time
for the translational movement of a particle with the radius (a) on the distance
( ¯∆x)1/2 ≃ 0.6a (Einstein, 1965);

V = 4πa3/3 is the volume of the spherical particle; kB is the Boltzmann
constant, T and η are the absolute temperature and bulk viscosity of the solvent.
On the other hand, the rate constant of [A → B] reaction for a molecule in
gas phase, which is related to passing through the activation barrier GA→B, is
described with the Eyring-Polany equation:

kA→B =

kTB

h

exp(cid:18)−

GA→B

RT (cid:19)

(2)

To describe the large-scale dynamics of macromolecules in solution related to
ﬂuctuations of domains and subunits (librations and pulsations), an equation is
needed which takes into account the diﬀusion and activation processes simulta-
neously.

10

The rate constant for the rotational- translational diﬀusion of the parti-
cle (kc) forming a macromolecule (continuous LS-dynamics) is expressed with
the generalized Stokes-Einstein and Eyring-Polany equation (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen and
Goryunov, 1987):

Kc =

kBT
ηV

exp(cid:18)−

Gst

RT (cid:19) = τ −1

c

(3)

where: V is the eﬀective volume of domain or subunit, which are capable to
the Brownian mobility independently from the rest part of the macromolecule,
with the probability:

Plb = exp(cid:18)−

Gst

RT (cid:19) ,

(4)

where: Gst is the activation energy of structural change in the contact (hinge)
region of a macromolecule, necessary for independent mobility of domain or
subunit; τc is the eﬀective correlation time for the continuous diﬀusion of this
relatively independent particle.

The eﬀective volume V can be changed under the inﬂuence of

temperature, perturbants and ligands.

The generalized Stokes-Einstein and Eyring-Polany equation (3)
is applicable also to describing the diﬀusion of the whole (integer)
particle, dependent on the surrounding medium ﬂuctuations with ac-
tivation energy (Ga). The ligand diﬀusion in the active site cavity of
proteins is such a type of processes.

To describe noncontinuous process, the formula for rate constant (kjump)
of the jump-like translations of particle, related to emergency of cavitational
ﬂuctuations (holes) near the particle was proposed (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen and Goryunov,
1987):

kjump =

1
τ min
jump

exp(cid:18)−

W

RT (cid:19) =

1

τjump

,

where:

W = σS + ns(µout − µin)

(5)

(6)

is the work of cavitation ﬂuctuation with the cavity surface S, at which ns
molecules of the solvent (water) change its eﬀective chemical potential from µin
to µout.

The dimensions of cavity ﬂuctuation near particle must be comparable to

corresponding particles.

11

In a homogeneous phase (i.e. pure water) under equilibrium conditions we
have: µin = µout. With an increase of particle sizes, surface of cavitational
ﬂuctuation (S) and its work (W), the corresponding probability of cavitation
ﬂuctuations:

Pjump = exp(−W/RT )

will fall.

The notion of the surface energy (σ) retains its meaning even at very small

”holes” because of its molecular nature (see Section 11.4 of [1] and [4]).

τ min
jump in eq. (5) is the minimal possible jump-time of a particle with mass

(m) over the distance λ with the mean velocity:

vmax = (2kT /m)1/2

Hence, we derive for the maximal jump-rate at W=0:

kmax
jump =

1
τ min
jump

=

Vmax

λ

=

1

λ (cid:18) 2kT

m (cid:19)1/2

(7)

(8)

In the case of hinged domains, forming macromolecules their relative A ⇋ B
displacements (pulsations) are related not only to possible holes forming in
the interdomain (intersubunit) cavities or near their outer surfaces, but to the
structural change of hinge regions as well.

If the activation energy of necessary structure changes is equal to GA⇋B

st

then eq. (5), with regard for (8), is transformed into

where: WA,B is the work required for cavitational ﬂuctuations of water; this
work can be diﬀerent in two directions: (WB) is necessary for nonmonotonic
B → A transition; (WA) is necessary for jump-way A → B transition.

Under certain conditions A ⇋ B transitions between protein conformers
(LS- pulsations) can be realized owing to the jump-way and continuous types
of relative diﬀusion of domains or subunits as two stage reaction. In this case,
the resulting rate constant of the process will be expressed through (9) and (3)
as:

kA⇔B

is the complex Hamaker constant; H is the slit thickness between domains in A-
state; Ac and As are simple Hamaker constants, characterizing the properties
of water in the A-state of the cavity and in the bulk solvent, correspondingly.
They depend on the concentration of water molecules (Nc ≃ Ns) and their

In the ”closed” A-state of a cavity the water layer between domains has a
more compact packing as compared with the ice-like structure of a water cluster
in the B-state of a cavity, or with a free solvent. As far HA < HB the dispersion
interaction (11) between domains in A- state of cavity is stronger, than that in
B-state: U A

H > U B
H .

Disjoining pressure of water in the cavities

Π = −A∗/6πH 3

(12a)

decreases with the increase of the complex Hamaker constant (A∗) that corre-
sponds to the increase of the attraction energy (UH) between domains.

Cooperative properties of clusters in open (B)-states of the cavities are more
pronounced as compared to that in bulk water. That results in the greater
changes of αcNc than that of αsNs induced by temperature. The elevation of
temperature decreasing the dimensions of interdomain water clusters leads to
the strengthening of interdomain interaction, while the lowering temperature
leads to opposite eﬀect.

We can judge about the changes of αsNs in the experiment on measuring
the solvent refraction index, as far from our theory of refraction index (eq. 8.14

In the closed cavities the eﬀect of temperature on water properties is lower
as compared to that in bulk water. It follows that thermoinduced non-
monotonic transition in the solvent refraction index must be accom-
panied by in-phase nonmonotonic changes of the [A ⇔ B] equilibrium
constant (KA⇔B). As far (A) and (B) conformers usually have diﬀerent sta-
bility and ﬂexibility, the changes of KA⇔B will be manifested in the changes
of protein large-scale and small-scale dynamics. It has been shown before that
viscosity itself has nonmonotonic temperature dependence due to the nonmono-
tonic dependence of n2(t) (eq.11.44, 11.45 and 11.48 of [1] or paper [4]).

Thus, thermoinduced non-denaturational transitions of macromolecules

and supramolecular systems located in the aqueous environment are
caused by nonmonotonic changes in solvent properties, including its
refraction index.

The inﬂuence of D2O and other perturbants on protein dynamics is explained
in a similar way. The eﬀect of deuterium oxide (D2O) is a result of substitution
of H2O from protein cavities and corresponding change of complex Hamaker
constant (12).

Generalized equation (3) is applicable not only for evaluating the frequency
of macromolecules transition between A and B conformers but also for the
frequency of the dumped librations of domains and subunits within A and B
conformers. Judging by various data (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen, 1985, 1989b), the interval of
A ⇋ B pulsation frequency is:

νA⇔B =

1

tA + tB

≈ kA→B = (104 − 107) s−1

(13)

where: tA and tB are the lifetimes of A and B conformers.

The corresponding interval of the total activation energy of the jump-way
A ⇔ B pulsations can be evaluated from the eq. (9). We assume for this end
that the pre-exponential multiplier is about 1010s−1 as a frequency of cavita-

tional ﬂuctuations in water with the radius ˜(10-15)

Taking a logarithm of (9) we derive:

o
A.

GA⇔B

res = (WA,B + GA⇔B

st

) ≈ RT (ln 1010 − ln νA⇔B)

(14)

At physiological temperatures the following region of energy corresponds to the
frequency range of pulsations (13)

GA⇔B

res ≈ (4 − 8) kcal/mole

(15)

Such a region of energies is pertinent to a wide range of biochemical processes.
The quick jump-way pulsations of macromolecules can cause acoustic shock-
waves in the solvent and its structure destabilization. Concomitant increase
in water activity leads to distant interaction between diﬀerent proteins as well

14

as proteins and cells. Such solvent-mediated phenomena were discovered and
studied in our laboratory by set of specially elaborated methods (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen,
1985, 1986, 1987; K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen et al., 1990, K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen et al., 1993).

When the [A ⇔ B] transitions in proteins are related to continuous diﬀusion
only, then the Gst values calculated using eq.(3) for the same frequency interval
(104 − 107) s, is about (3 - 7) kcal/mole.

The Kramers equation (1940), which has earlier been widely used for de-

scribing diﬀusion processes, has the form:

k =

A
η

exp(cid:18)−

H ∗

RT (cid:19)

(16)

where A is a constant and η - solvent viscosity.

The pre-exponential factor in our generalized equation (3) con-
tains not only the viscosity, but also the temperature and the eﬀec-
tive volume of a particle. It was shown in our experiments that eq.
(3) describes the dynamic processes, which occur in macromolecules,
solutions much better than the Kramer’s equation (16).

3. Dynamic model of protein-ligand complexes formation

According to our model of speciﬁc complexes formation the fol-

lowing order of events is assumed (Fig. 2):

1. Ligand (L) collides with the active site (AS), formed usually by
two domains, in its open (b) state: the structure of water cluster in
AS is being perturbed and water is forced out of AS cavity totally or
partially;

2. Transition of AS from the open (b) to the closed (a) state occurs
due to strong shift of [a ⇔ b] equilibrium to the left, i.e. to the AS
domains large scale dynamics;

3. A process of dynamic adaptation of complex [L+AS] begins,
accompanied by the directed ligand diﬀusion in AS cavity due to
its domains small-scale dynamics and deformation of their tertiary
structure;

4. If the protein is oligomeric with few AS, then the above events
cause changes in the geometry of the central cavity between subunits
in the open state leading to the destabilization of the large central
water cluster and the shift of the A ⇋ B, corresponding to R ⇋ T equi-
librium of quaternary structure leftward. Water is partially forced
out from central cavity.

Due to the feedback mechanism this shift can inﬂuence the [a ⇔ b]
equilibrium of the remaining free AS and promotes its reaction with
the next ligand. Every new ligand stimulates this process, promoting

15

the positive cooperativity. The negative cooperativity also could be
resulted from the interaction between central cavity and active sites;
5. The terminal [protein − ligand] complex is formed as a conse-
quence of the relaxation process, representing deformation of domains
and subunits tertiary structure. This stage could be much slower than
the initial ones [1-3]. As a result of it, the stability of the complex
grows up.

Dissociation of speciﬁc complex is a set of reverse processes to that

described above which starts from the [a∗ → b] ﬂuctuation of the AS cavity.

In multidomain proteins like antibodies, which consist of 12 do-
mains, and in oligomeric proteins, the cooperative properties of H2O
clusters in the cavities can determine the mechanism of signal trans-
mission from AS to the remote eﬀector regions and allosteric protein
properties.

The stability of a librational water eﬀecton as coherent cluster strongly de-
pends on its sizes and geometry. This means that very small deformations
of protein cavity, which violate the [cavity-cluster] complementary condition,
induce a cooperative shift of [A ⇔ B] equilibrium leftward. The clusterphilic
interaction, introduced by us (see section 13.3 of [1] or paper [4]) turns to hy-
drophobic one due to [lb/tr] conversion.

This process can be developed step by step. For example, the reori-
entation of variable domains, which form the antibodies active site (AS) after
reaction with the antigen determinant or hapten deforms the next cavity be-
tween pairs of variable and constant domains forming Fab subunits (Fig.2). The
leftward shift of [A ⇔ B] equilibrium of this cavity, in turn, changes the ge-
ometry of the big central cavity between Fab and Fc subunits, perturbing the
structure of the latter. Therefore, the signal transmission from the AS
to the eﬀector sites of Fc subunits occurs due to the balance shift
between clusterphilic and hydrophobic interactions. This signal is re-
sponsible for complement- binding sites activation and triggering the receptors
function on the lymphocyte membranes, in accordance to our model.

The leftward shift of [A ⇔ B] equilibrium in a number of cavities in the
elongated multidomain proteins can lead to the signiﬁcant decrease of their
linear size and dehydration. The mechanism of muscular contraction is probably
based on such phenomena and clusterphilic interactions (see next section).

For such a nonlinear system the energy is necessary for reorientation of the
ﬁrst couple of domains only. The process then goes on spontaneously with
decreasing the averaged protein chemical potential.

The chemical potential of the A- conformer is usually lower than that of
B- conformer ( ¯GA < ¯GB) and the relaxation of protein is accompanied by the
leftward A ⇔ B equilibrium shift of cavities.

It is predictable, that hydration of proteins will decrease, when clusterphilic

[water-cavity] interaction turns to hydrophobic one.

Fig. 2. The schematic picture of the protein association (Fab
subunits of antibody with a ligand), which is accompanied by the
destabilization of water clusters in cavities, according to the dynamic
model (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen, 1985). The dotted line denotes the perturba-
tion of the tertiary structure of the domains forming the active site.
Antibodies of IgG type contain usually two such Fab subunit and
one Fc subunit, conjugated with 2Fab by ﬂexible hinge, forming the
general Y-like structure.

Our dynamic model of protein behavior and signal transmission, described
above, is an alternative to solitonic mechanism of non dissipative signal trans-
mission in proteins and in other biosystems proposed by Davidov (1973). Prop-
agation of solitonic wave is a well known nonlinear process in the ordered ho-
mogeneous mediums. The solitons can originate, when the nonlinear eﬀects
are compensated by the wave dispersion eﬀects. Dispersion is reﬂected in fact
that the longer waves spreads in medium with higher velocity than the shorter
ones.

However, biosystems of nonregular, ﬂuctuating structure are not

the mediums, good for solitons emergency and propagation.

Our dynamic model takes into account the real multidomain and
multiglobular structure of a proteins and properties of their hydration
shell fractions. In contrast to Davidov’s solitonic model, the dissipa-
tion processes like reversible ”melting” of water clusters, accompa-
nied by large-scale dynamics of proteins, are the necessary stages of
our [hydrophobic ⇋ clusterphilic] mechanism of signal transmission
in biosystems.

17

The evolution of the ideas of the protein-ligand complex formation

proceeded in the following sequence:

1. ”Key-lock” or the rigid conformity between the geometry of an

active site and that of a ligand (Fisher, 1894);

2. ”Hand-glove” or the so-called principle of induced conformity

(Koshland, 1962);

3. At the current stage of complex-formation process understand-
ing, the crucial role of protein dynamics gets clearer. Our model
allows us to put forward the ”Principle of Stabilized Conformity
(PSC)” instead that of ”induced conformity” in protein-ligand spe-
ciﬁc reaction.

Principle of Stabilized Conformity (PSC) means that the geome-
try of the active site (AS), optimal from energetic and stereochem-
ical conditions, is already existing BEFORE reaction with ligand.
The optimal geometry of AS is to be the only one selected among
the number of others and stabilized by ligand, but not induced ”de
nova”.

For example, the [a ⇔ b] large-scale pulsations of the active sites
due to domain ﬂuctuations and stabilization of the closed (a) state
by ligand are necessary for the initial stages of reaction. Such active
site pulsations decreases the total activation energy necessary for the
terminal complex formation as multistage process.

4. The life-time of quasiparticles and frequencies of their excitation

The set of formula, describing the dynamic properties of quasipar-
ticles, introduced in mesoscopic theory was presented at Chapter 4
of book [1] and paper [2]:

The frequency of c- Macrotransitons or Macroconvertons excitation, repre-
senting [dissociation/association] of primary librational eﬀectons - ”ﬂickering
clusters” as a result of interconversions between primary [lb] and [tr] eﬀectons
is:

FcM =

1
τMc

· PMc/Z

where: PMc = Pac · Pbc is a probability of macroconverton excitation;
Z is a total partition function (see eq.4.2 of [1, 2]);
the life-time of macroconverton is:

τMc = (τac · τbc)1/2

18

(17)

(18)

The cycle-period of (ac) and (bc) convertons are determined by the sum of
life-times of intermediate states of primary translational and librational eﬀec-
tons:

τac = (τa)tr + (τa)lb;
τbc = (τb)tr + (τb)lb;

(19)

The life-times of primary and secondary eﬀectons (lb and tr) in a- and b-

states are the reciprocal values of corresponding state frequencies:

[τa = 1/νa; τa = 1/νa]tr,lb;

[τb = 1/νb; τ b = 1/νb]tr,lb

(20)

[(νa) and (νb)]tr,lb correspond to eqs. 4.8 and 4.9 of [1, 2];
[(νa) and (νb)]tr,lb could be calculated using eqs.4.16; 4.17 [1, 2].
The frequency of (ac) and (bc) convertons excitation [lb/tr]:

Fac =

Fbc =

1
τac

1
τbc

· Pac/Z

· Pbc/Z

(21)

(22)

where: Pac and Pbc are probabilities of corresponding convertons excitations

(see eq.4.29a of [1, 2]).

The frequency of Supereﬀectons and Superdeformons (biggest ﬂuc-

tuations) excitation is:

FSD =

1

(τA∗ + τB∗ + τD∗ )

· P D∗

S /Z

(23)

It is dependent on cycle-period of Supereﬀectons: τSD = τA∗ + τB∗ + τD∗
and probability of Superdeformon activation ( P D∗

S ), like the limiting stage

of this cycle.

The averaged life-times of Supereﬀectons in A∗ and B ∗ state are dependent

on similar states of translational and librational macroeﬀectons :

τA∗ = [(τA)tr · (τA)lb] = [(τaτa)tr · (τaτa)lb]1/2

(24)

and that in B state:

τB∗ = [(τB)tr · (τB)lb] = [(τbτb)tr · (τbτb)lb]1/2

(25)

19

The life-time of Superdeformons excitation is determined by frequency of

beats between A∗ and B∗states of Supereﬀectons as:

τD∗ = 1/ |(1/τA∗ ) − (1/τB∗)|

(26)

The frequency of translational and librational macroeﬀectons A ⇋

B cycle excitations could be deﬁned in a similar way:

where:

and

(cid:20)FM =

1

(τA + τB + τD)

· P D

M /Z(cid:21)tr,lb

(τA)tr,lb = [(τa · τa)tr,lb]1/2

(τB)tr,lb = [(τb · τb)tr,lb]1/2

(τD)tr,lb = 1/ |(1/τA) − (1/τB)|tr,lb

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

The frequency of primary translational eﬀectons (a ⇋b)tr transi-

tions could be expressed like:

Ftr =

1/Z

(τa + τb + τt)tr

· (Pd)tr

(31)

where: (Pd)tr is a probability of primary translational deformons excitation (eq.
4.25 of [1, 2]);

[τa; τb]tr are the life-times of (a) and (b) states of primary translational ef-

fectons (eq. 20).

The frequency of primary librational eﬀectons as (a ⇋ b)lb cycles

excitations is:

Flb =

1/Z

(τa + τb + τt)lb

· (Pd)lb

(32)

where: (Pd)lbis a probability of primary librational deformons excitation; τa and
τb are the life-times of (a) and (b) states of primary librational eﬀectons deﬁned
as (20).

The life-time of primary transitons (tr and lb) as a result of quantum beats

between (a) and (b) states of primary eﬀectons could be introduced as:

20

[τt = |1/τa − 1/τb|−1]tr,lb

(33)

For the case of (a ⇔ b)1,2,3 transitions of primary and secondary eﬀectons
(tr and lb), their life-times in (a) and (b) states are the reciprocal value of
corresponding frequencies: [τa = 1/νa and τb = 1/νb]1,2,3
tr,lb . These parameters
and the resulting ones could be calculated from eqs.(2.27; 2.28 of [1]) for primary
eﬀectons and (2.54; 2.55 of [1]) for secondary ones.

The results of calculations, using eqs. (31, 32) for frequency of excitations

of primary tr and lb eﬀectons are plotted on Fig. 3a,b.

The frequencies of Macroconvertons and Superdeformons were calculated

using eqs.(17 and 23).

Fig. 3.

(a) - Frequency of primary [tr] eﬀectons excitations,

calculated from eq.(31);

(b) - Frequency of primary [lb] eﬀectons excitations, calculated

from eq.(32);

(c) - Frequency of [lb/tr] Macroconvertons (ﬂickering clusters)

excitations, calculated from eq.(17);

(d) - Frequency of Superdeformons excitations, calculated from

eq.(28).

At the temperature interval (0-100)0C the frequencies of translational and
librational macrodeformons (tr and lb) are in the interval of (1.3-2.8)·109s−1 and

21

(0.2-13)·106s−1 correspondingly. The frequencies of (ac) and (bc) convertons
could be deﬁned also using our software and formulae, presented at the end of
Chapter 4 of [1, 2].

The frequency of primary translational eﬀectons [a ⇔ b]tr excitations at
200C, calculated from eq.(31) is ν ∼ 7 · 1010(1/s). It corresponds to electromag-
netic wave length in water with refraction index (n = 1.33) of:

λ = (cn)/ν ∼ 6mm

(34)

For the other hand, there are a lot of evidence, that irradiation of very diﬀerent
biological systems with such coherent electromagnetic ﬁeld exert great inﬂuences
on their properties (Grundler and Keilman, 1983).

Between the dynamics/function of proteins, membranes, etc. and
dynamics of their aqueous environment the strong interrelation is
existing.

The frequency of macroconvertons, representing big density ﬂuctuation in

the volume of primary librational eﬀecton at 37C is about 107(1/s) (Fig 3c).

The frequency of librational macrodeformons at the same tem-
perature is about 106 s−1,i.e. coincides with frequency of large-scale
protein cavities pulsations between open and closed to water states
(see Fig.2). This conﬁrm our hypothesis that the clusterphilic in-
teraction is responsible for stabilization of the proteins cavities open
state and that transition from the open state to the closed one is
induced by coherent water cluster dissociation.

The frequency of Superdeformons excitation (Fig.3d) is much lower:

νs ∼ (104 − 105) s−1

(35)

Superdeformons are responsible for cavitational ﬂuctuations in liq-
uids and origination of defects in solids. Dissociation of oligomeric
proteins, like hemoglobin or disassembly (peptization)of actin and
microtubules could be also related with such big ﬂuctuations.

5. Mesoscopic mechanism of enzyme catalysis

The mechanism of enzyme catalysis is one of the most intriguing
and unresolved yet problems of molecular biology. It becomes clear,
that it is interrelated not only with a spatial, but as well with hier-
archical complicated dynamic properties of proteins (see book: ”The
Fluctuating Enzyme” , Ed. by G.R.Welch, 1986).

The [proteins + solvent] system should be considered as a cooperative one
with feedback links (Kaivarainen, 1985, 1992). Somogyi and Damjanovich
(1986) proposed a similar idea that collective excitations of protein structure
are interrelated with surrounded water molecules oscillations.

22

The enzymatic reaction can be represented in accordance with our
dynamic model as a consequence of the following stages (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen,
1989; [1] ).

The ﬁrst stage:

(I)

Eb + S ⇋ EbS

(36)

- the collision of the substrate (S) with the open (b) state of the active site [AS]
cavity of enzyme (E).

The frequency of collisions between the enzyme and the substrate, whose
concentrations are [CE] and [CS], respectively, is expressed with the known
formula (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980):

νcol = 4πr0(DE + DS) · N0[CE] · [CS]

(37)

where: r0 = aE + aS is the sum of the enzyme’s and substrate’s molecular radii;
N0 is the Avogadro number;

DE =

kT

6πηaE

and DS =

kT

6πηaS

(38)

- are the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the enzyme and substrate; k is the Boltzmann
constant; T is absolute temperature; η is a solvent viscosity.

The probability of collision of (b) state of the active site with substrate is
proportional to the ratio of the b-state outer cross section area to the whole
enzyme surface area:

Pb =

∅b
∅E

· Fb

(39)

is a fraction of time, the active site [AS] spend in the

where: Fb = fb

fb+fa

open (b) - state.

So, the frequency of collision between the substrate and (b) state of the

active site (AS) with account for (40), meaning the ﬁrst stage of reaction is:

The second stage of enzymatic reaction is a formation of the primary enzyme-

νb
col = νcol · Pb = kI

(40)

substrate complex:

(II)

EbS ⇔ [Ea∗

S](1)

(41)

23

It corresponds to transition of the active site cavity from the open (b) state to
the closed (a) one and stabilization the latter state by a ligand.

The rate constant of the [b → a] transitions is derived with the Stokes-

Einstein and Eyring -Polany generalized equation (3):

where: η is the solvent viscosity; V is the eﬀective volume of the enzyme

the active site [AS].

The leftward shift of the [a ⇔ b] equilibrium between two states of the active

of stabilized conformity, related to AS domains movements that we have put
forward in the previous section.

The third stage:

(III)

[EaS] ⇔ [Ea∗

S ∗]

(43)

represents the formation of the secondary speciﬁc complex. This process is
related to directed ligand diﬀusion into the active site cavity and the dynamic
adaptation of its geometry to the geometry of the active site.

Here the Principle of Stabilized microscopic Conformity is real-
ized, when the AS change its geometry from (a) to (a∗) without do-
mains reorientation. The rate constant of this stage is determined by the rate
constant of substrate diﬀusion in the closed (a) state of the active site cavity. It
is also expressed by generalized kinetic equation (42), but with other values
of variables:

where:

τ ∗

exp(cid:18)−

RT (cid:19) = kIII

τs = (vs/k)ηin/T

(44)

(45)

is the correlation time of substrate of volume (vs) in the (a) state of the active
site; ηin is the internal eﬀective viscosity; Ga
S is the activation energy of thermal
ﬂuctuations of groups, representing small-scale dynamics (SS), which determine
the directed diﬀusion of a substrate in the active site [AS] closed cavity.

The directed character of ligand diﬀusion in AS can be determined by the
relaxation of a protein structure, due to perturbation of AS domains by ligand.
The relaxation changes were observed in many reactions of speciﬁc protein-
ligand complexes formation (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen, 1985, 1989).

24

The complex formation [pair of domains forming the AS + substrate], fol-
lowed by these domain immobilization can be considered as an emergency of a
new enlarged protein primary eﬀecton from two smaller ones, corresponding to
less independent AS domains or their compact ”nodes”.

We assume that at this important stage, the waves B of the attack-
ing catalytic atoms (λc
B) start
to overlap and interfere in such a way that conditions for quantum-
mechanical beats between them become possible.

B) and the attacked substrate atoms (λS

Let us consider these conditions in more detail.

According to classical statistics, every degree of freedom gets the energy,
which is equal to kT /2. This condition corresponds to harmonic approximation
when the mean potential and kinetic energies of particles are the same:

V = Tk = mv2/2 ≈ kT /2

(46)

The corresponding to such ideal case the de Broglie wave (wave B) length is
equal to:

λB =

h
mv

=

h

(mkT)1/2

(47)

For such condition the wave B length of proton at room temperature is nearly
2.5˚A, for a carbon atom it is about three times smaller and for oxygen - four
times as small.

In the latter two cases, the wave B lengths are comparable and even less
than the sizes of the atoms itself. So, their waves can not overlap and, beats
between them are not possible.

However, in real condensed systems with quantum properties, in-
cluding the active sites of enzymes, the harmonic approximation is
not valid because (Tk/V ) ≪ 1 (see Fig. 5 of [1]). Consequently, the
kinetic energy of atoms of AS:

Tk ≪ (1/2)kT

and

λB ≫ h/(mkT )1/2

(47a)

It must be taken into account that librations, in a general case
are presented by rotational-translational unharmonic oscillations of
atoms and molecules, but not by their rotational motions only (Coﬀey
et al., 1984).

The length of waves B of atoms caused by a small translational
component of most probable impulse, related to librations is bigger
than that related to pure translations:

[λlb = (h/Plb)] > [λtr = (h/Ptr)]

(47b)

25

Even in pure water the linear sizes of primary librational eﬀectons
are several times bigger than that of translational eﬀectons and the
size of one H2O molecule (see Fig. 7 of [1] or Fig.4 of [2]).

In composition of the active site rigid core the librational waves B
of atoms can signiﬁcantly exceed the sizes of the atoms themselves.
In this case their superposition, leading to quantum beats of waves
B in the [active site - substrate] complex, accelerating the enzyme
reaction is quite possible.

In accordance to our model, periodic energy exchange resulting
from such beats occurs between waves B of the substrate and active
site atoms.

The reaction [S ∗ → P ], accelerating by these quantum beats, is the
next 4th stage of enzymatic process - the chemical transformation of
a substrate into product:

(IV )

[Ea∗

S ∗] → [Ea∗

P ]

(48)

The angular wave B frequency of the attacked atoms of substrate with mass mS
and the amplitude AS can be expressed by eq.(2.20):

ωS = /2mSA2
S

(49)

The wave B frequency of the attacking catalytic atom (or a group of atoms)

in the active site is equal to:

ωcat =



2mcAc

(50)

The frequency of quantum beats which appear between waves B of catalytic and
substrate atoms is:

ω∗ = ωcat − ωS = (cid:18) 1

2mcAc

−

1

2mSAS(cid:19)

The corresponding energy of beats:

E ∗ = Ecat − ES = ω∗

(51)

It is seen from these formulae that the smaller the wave B mass of the cat-
alytic atom (mc) and its amplitude (Ac), the more frequently these beats occur
at constant parameters of substrate (mS and AS). The energy of beats is
transmitted to the wave B of the attacked substrate atom from the
catalytic atom, accelerating the reaction.

26

According to our model, the perturbations in the region of the active site are
accompanied by the appearance of phonons and acoustic deformons in a form of
small-scale dynamics of protein structure. They provide the signal transmission
in oligomeric proteins to the central cavity and other active sites leading to
allosteric eﬀects.

It is known from the theory of oscillations (Grawford, 1973) that the eﬀect

of beats is maximal, if the amplitudes of the interacting oscillators are equal:

A2

c ≈ A2
S

(53)

The [substrate → product] transformation can be considered as a result of the
substrate wave B transition from the main [S] state to excited [P] state. The
rate constant of such a reaction in the absence of the catalyst (kS→P ) can be
presented by the modiﬁed Eyring-Polany formulae, leading from eq.(2.27 of [1])
at condition: exp(hνp/kT ) >> 1

(54)

where: ES = hνS and EP = hνP are the main and excited - transitional
to product energetic states of substrate, correspondingly; νS and νP are the
substrate wave B frequencies in the main and excited states, respectively.

If catalyst is present, which acts by the above described mechanism, then
the energy of the substrate ES is increased by the magnitude Ecat with the
quantum beats frequency ω∗ (51) and gets equal to:

ESc = ES + Ecat

(55)

Substituting EP = hνP
B ) in (54), we derive the
rate constants for the catalytic reaction in the moment of beats (kSc→P ). This
corresponds to the 4th stage of enzymatic reaction:

B and ESc = h(νS

B + νcat

(IV): kSc→P = νP exp(cid:20)−

h(νP − νS − νcat)

kT

(cid:21) = kIV

(56)

where: νP , νS and νc are the most probable B wave frequencies of the transition
[S → P ] state, of the substrate and of the catalyst atoms, correspondingly.

Hence, in the presence of the catalyst the coeﬃcient of acceleration

(q) is equal to:

qcat =

kSc→P

kS→P = exp(cid:18) hνcat
kT (cid:19)

(57)

27

For example, at

hνc/kT ≈ 10;

qcat =2.2 · 104

(58)

At room temperatures this condition corresponds to

Ecat = hνcat ≃ 6 kcal/mole.

The beating acts, followed by transitions of a substrate molecule to activated
by catalyst excited state (S → Sc), can be accompanied by the absorption of
phonons or photons with the frequency ω∗ (51).
In this case, the insolation
of a [substrate - catalyst] system with ultrasound or electromagnetic ﬁeld of
the frequency ω∗ should strongly accelerate the reaction when the resonance
conditions are satisﬁed.

It is possible that the resonance eﬀects of this type can account for the ex-
perimentally revealed response of various biological systems to electromagnetic
ﬁeld radiation with the frequency about 6 · 1010Hz (Deviatkov et al., 1973). We
have to point out that just such frequency is close to the frequency of (a⇋ b)tr
transitions excitation of primary translational water eﬀectons. The strict cor-
relation between the dynamics of water and that of biosystems should
exist on each hierarchic level of time and space.

Changes in the volume, geometry and electronic properties of the substrate
molecule, resulting from its transition to the product, change its interaction
energy with the active site by the magnitude:

∆Ea∗

SP = (Ea∗

S − Ea∗
P )

(59)

It must destabilize the closed state of the active site and increase the probability
of its reverse [a∗ → b∗] transition.

Such transition promotes the last 5th stage of the catalytic cycle

- the dissociation of the enzyme-product complex:

(V )

[Ea∗

P ] ⇔ [Eb

P P ] ⇔ Eb + P

(60)

The resulting rate constant of this stage, like stage (II), is described by the
generalized Stokes-Einstein and Eyring-Polany equation (42), but with diﬀerent
activation energy Ga∗

valid for the [a∗ → b] transition:

(61)

If the lifetime of the (a∗) state is suﬃciently long, then the desorption of the
product can occur irrespective of [a∗ → b] transition, but with a longer char-
acteristic time as a consequence of its diﬀusion out of the active site’s ”closed

28

state”. The rate constant of this process (k∗
p) is determined by small-scale dy-
namics. It practically does not depend on solvent viscosity, but can grows up
with rising temperature, like at the 3d stage, described by (44):

where ηin
a∗ is active site interior viscosity in the closed (a∗) state; vP is the
eﬀective volume of product molecules; Pa∗ = exp(−Ga∗
P /RT ) is the probability
of small-scale, functionally important motions necessary for the desorption of
the product from the (a∗) state of the active site; Ga∗
p is the free energy of
activation of such motions.

Because the processes, described by the eq.(61) and (62), are in-
dependent, the resulting product desorption rate constant is equal
to:

kV = ka∗

(64)

This stage is accompanied by the relaxation of the perturbed AS domain and
remnant protein structure to the initial state.

After the whole reaction cycle is completed the enzyme gets ready for the
next cycle. The number of cycles (catalytic acts) in the majority of enzymes is
within the limits of (102 − 104) s−1. It means that the [a ⇋ b] pulsations of the
active site cavities must occur with higher frequency as far it is only one of the
ﬁve stages of enzymatic reaction cycle.

In experiments, where various sucrose concentrations were used at constant
temperature, the dependence of enzymatic catalysis rate on solvent viscosity
(T /η) was demonstrated (Gavish and Weber, 1979). The amendment for chang-
ing the dielectric penetrability of the solvent by sucrose was taken into account.
There are reasons to consider stages (II) and/or (V) in the model described
above as the limiting ones of enzyme catalysis. According to eqs.(43) and (61),
these stages depend on (T /η), indeed.

The resulting rate constant of the enzyme reaction could be ex-
pressed as the reciprocal sum of life times of all its separate stages
(I-V):

kres = 1/τres = 1/(τI + τII + τIII + τIV + τV )

(65)

τV corresponds to eq.(64).

The slowest stages of the reaction seem to be stages (II), (V), and stage
(III). The latter is dependent only on the small- scale dynamics in the region of
the active site.

Sometimes product desorption goes on much more slowly than other stages

of the enzymatic process, i.e.

kV ≪ kIII ≪ kII

Then the resulting rate of the process (kres) is represented by its limiting stage
(eq. 63):

The corresponding period of enzyme turnover: τres ≈ τV

(eq 64). The
internal medium viscosity (ηin) in the protein regions, which are far from the
periphery, is 2-3 orders higher than the viscosity of a water-saline solvent (0.001
P) under standard conditions:

(ηin/η) ≥ 103

Therefore, the changes of sucrose concentration in the limits of 0-40% at con-
stant temperature can not inﬂuence markedly internal small- scale dynamics in
proteins, its activation energy (Ga∗
) and internal microviscosity (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen,
1989b). This fact was revealed using the spin-label method. It is in accordance
with viscosity dependencies of tryptophan ﬂuorescence quenching in proteins
and model systems related to acrylamide diﬀusion in protein matrix (Eftink
and Hagaman, 1986). In the examples of parvalbumin and ribonuclease T1 it
has been shown that the dynamics of internal residues is practically insensitive
to changing solvent viscosity by glycerol over the range of 0.01 to 1 P.

It follows from the above data that the moderate changes in solvent viscosity
P value in eq.(66).

(η) at constant temperature do not inﬂuence markedly the k∗

30

Therefore, the isothermal dependencies of kres on (T /η)T with changing

sucrose or glycerol concentration must represent straight lines with the slope:

(67)

(68)

The volume of the Brownian particle (V) in eq.(67) corresponds to the eﬀective
volume of one of the domains, which reorientation is responsible for (a⇋ b)
transitions of the enzyme active site.

Under conditions when the activation energy Ga∗
st

weakly depends on tem-
perature, it is possible to investigate the temperature dependence of the eﬀective
volume V, using eq.(67), analyzing a slopes of set of isotherms (67).

→b

Our model predicts the increasing of V with temperature rising. This reﬂects
the dumping of the large-scale dynamics of proteins due to water clusters melting
and enhancement the Van der Waals interactions between protein domains and
subunits (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen, 1985; 1989b, K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen et al., 1993). The contribution
of the small-scale dynamics (k∗) to kres must grow due to its thermoactivation
and the decrease in ηin and Ga∗

(eq.32).

The diﬀusion trajectory of ligands, substrates and products of en-
zyme reactions in ”closed” (a) states of active sites is probably deter-
mined by the spatial gradient of minimum wave B length (maximum
impulses) values of atoms, forming the active site cavity.

We suppose, that functionally important motions (FIM), introduced by
H. Frauenfelder et al., (1985, 1988), are determined by speciﬁc geometry of the
impulse space characterizing the distribution of small-scale dynamics of domains
in the region of protein’s active site.

The analysis of the impulse distribution in the active site area
and energy of quantum beats between de Broglie waves of the atoms
of substrate and active sites, modulated by solvent-dependent large-
scale dynamics, should lead to complete understanding of the physical
background of enzyme catalysis.

6. The mechanism of ATP hydrolysis energy utilization in muscle

contraction

and protein polymerization

A great number of biochemical reactions are endothermic, i.e. they
need additional thermal energy in contrast to exothermic ones. The
most universal and common source of this additional energy is a re-
action of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis:

31

ATP

k1
⇔
k−1

ADP + P

(69)

The reaction products are adenosinediphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phos-
phate (P).

The equilibrium constant of the reaction depends on the concentration of

the substrate [ATP] and products [ADP] and [P] like:

K =

k1
k−1

=

[ADP] · [P]

[ATP]

(70)

The equilibrium constant and temperature determine the reaction free energy
change:

∆G = −RT ln K = ∆H − T ∆S

(71)

where: ∆H and ∆S are changes in enthalpy and entropy, respectively.

Under the real conditions in cell the reaction of ATP hydrolysis is
highly favorable energetically as is accompanied by strong free energy
decrease: ∆G = −(11 ÷ 13) kcal/M.

It follows from (71) that ∆G < 0, when

T ∆S > ∆H

(72)

and the entropy and enthalpy changes are positive (∆S > 0 and ∆H >
0). However, the speciﬁc molecular mechanism of these changes in
diﬀerent biochemical reactions, including muscle contraction, remains
unclear.

Acceleration of actin polymerization and tubulin self-assembly to
the microtubules as a result of the ATP and nucleotide GTP splitting,
respectively, is still obscure as well.

Using our model of water-macromolecule interaction [6], we can
explain these processes by the ”melting” of the water clusters - libra-
tional eﬀectons in cavities between neighboring domains and subunits
of proteins. This melting is induced by absorption of energy of ATP
or GTP hydrolysis and represents [lb/tr] conversion of primary libra-
tional eﬀectons to translational ones. It leads to the partial dehydra-
tion and rapprochement of domains and subunits. The concomitant
transition of interdomain/subunit cavities from the ”open” B-state
to the ”closed” A-state should be accompanied by decreasing of lin-
ear dimensions of a macromolecule. This process is usually reversible
and responsible for the large-scale dynamics.

32

In the case when disjoining clusterphilic interactions that shift the
[A ⇔ B] equilibrium to the right are stronger than Van der Waals
interactions stabilizing A-state, the expansion of the macromolecule
can induce a mechanical ”pushing” force.

In accordance to our model, this ”swelling driving force” is re-
sponsible for shifting of myosin ”heads” as respect to the actin ﬁla-
ments and muscle contraction.

Such FIRST relaxation ”swelling working step” is accompanied by
dissociation of products of ATP hydrolysis from the active sites of myosin heads
(heavy meromyosin).

The SECOND stage of reaction, the dissociation of the complex: [myosin
”head” + actin], is related to the absorption of ATP at the myosin active site.
At this stage the A ⇔ B equilibrium between the heavy meromyosin conformers
is strongly shifted to the right, i.e. to an expanded form of the protein.

The THIRD stage is represented by the ATP hydrolysis, (ATP →
ADP + P) and expelling of (P) from the active site. The concomitant
local enthalpy and entropy jump leads to the melting of the water
clusters in the cavities, B → A transitions and the contraction of free
meromyosin heads.

The energy of the clusterphilic interaction at this stage is accumulated in

myosin like in a squeezed spring.

After this 3d stage is over the complex [myosin head + actin] forms

again.

We assume here that the interaction between myosin head and
actin induces the releasing of the product (ADP) from myosin active
site. It is important to stress that the driving force of ”swelling
working stage” : [A → B] transition of myosin cavities - is represented
by our clusterphilic interactions (see Section 13.3 of [1] and paper
[5]).

A repetition of such a cycle results in the relative shift of myosin
ﬁlaments with respect to actin ones and ﬁnally in muscle contraction.
The mechanism proposed does not need the hypothesis of Davydov’s soliton
propagation (Davydov, 1984) along a myosin macromolecule.
It seems that
this nondissipative process scarcely takes place in strongly ﬂuctuating biological
systems. Soliton model does not take into account the real mesoscopic structure
of macromolecules and their interaction with water as well.

Polymerization of actin, tubulin and other globular proteins com-
posing cytoplasmic and extracell ﬁlaments due to hydrophobic inter-
action can be accelerated as a result of their selected dehydration
due to local temperature jumps in mesoscopic volumes where the
ATP and GTP hydrolysis takes place.

The [assembly ⇔ disassembly] equilibrium is shifted as a result of such
mesophase transition to the left in the case when [protein − protein] interface
Van-der-Waals interactions are stronger than a clusterphilic one. The latter is

33

mediated by librational water eﬀecton stabilization in interdomain or intersub-
unit cavities.

It looks that the clusterphilic interactions play an extremely im-
portant role on mesoscale in the self-organization and dynamics of
biological systems.

7. Water activity as a regulative factor in the intra- and inter-cell

processes

Three most important factors can be responsible for the spatial

processes in living cells:

1. Self-organization of supramolecular systems in the form of mem-
branes, oligomeric proteins and ﬁlaments. Such processes can be me-
diated by water-dependent hydrophilic, hydrophobic and introduced
by us clusterphilic interactions [1, 5];

2. Compartmentalization of cell volume by semipermeable lipid-

bilayer membranes and due to diﬀerent cell’s organelles formation;

3. Changes in the volumes of diﬀerent cell compartments by os-
motic process correlated in space and time. These changes are depen-
dent on water activity regulated, in turn, mainly by [assembly⇋ disassembly]
equilibrium shift of microtubules and actin’s ﬁlaments.

Disassembly of ﬁlaments leads to water activity decreasing due to increas-
ing the fraction of vicinal water, representing a developed system of
enlarged primary librational eﬀectons near the surface of proteins (see
section 13.5 of [1] and [5]). The thickness of vicinal water layer is about 50 ˚A,
depending on temperature and mobility of intra-cell components.

The vicinal water with more ordered and cooperative structure than that of
bulk water represents the dominant fraction of intra-cell water. A lot of experi-
mental evidences, pointing to important role of vicinal water in cell physiology
were presented in reviews of Drost-Hansen and Singleton (1992) and Clegg and
Drost-Hansen (1991).

The dynamic equilibrium: { I ⇔ II ⇔ III } between three stages of macro-
molecular self-organization, discussed in Section 13.5 of [1] (Table 2) and in
paper [5], has to play an important role in biosystems: blood, lymph as well as
inter- and intra-cell media. This equilibrium is dependent on the water activ-
ity (inorganic ions, pH), temperature, concentration and surface properties of
macromolecules.

Large-scale protein dynamics, decreasing the fraction of vicinal water (K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen,

1986, K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen et al., 1990) is dependent on the protein’s active site ligand
state. These factors may play a regulative role in [coagulation ⇔ peptization]
and [gel ⇔ sol ] transitions in the cytoplasm of mobile cells, necessary for their
migration.

A lot of spatial cellular processes such as the increase or decrease in the
length of microtubules or actin ﬁlaments are dependent also on their self-
assembly from corresponding subunits (α, β tubulins and actin).

34

The self-assembly of such superpolymers is dependent on the [association
(A) ⇔ dissociation (B)] equilibrium constant (KA⇔B = K −1
B⇔A). In turn, this
constant is dependent on water activity (aH2O), as was shown earlier (eq.13.11a
and 13.12 of [1] and [5]).

The double helix of actin ﬁlaments, responsible for the spatial organization
and cell’s shape dynamics, is composed of the monomers of globular protein -
actin (MM 42.000). The rate of actin ﬁlament polymerization or depolymer-
ization, responsible for cells shape adaptation to environment, is very high and
strongly depends on ionic strength (concentration of N aCl, Ca++, M g++). For
example, the increasing of N aCl concentration and corresponding decreasing of
aH2O stimulate the actin polymerization. The same is true of α and β tubulin
polymerization in the form of microtubules.

The activity of water in cells and cell compartments can be regulated by
[N a+ − K +] AT P −dependent pumps. Even the equal concentrations of N a+
and K + decrease water activity aH2O diﬀerently due to their diﬀerent interaction
with bulk and, especially with ordered vicinal water (Wiggins 1971, 1973).

Regulation of pH by proton pumps, incorporated in membranes, also can be

of great importance for intra-cell aH2O changing.

Cell division is strongly correlated with dynamic equilibrium: [assembly ⇔
disassembly] of microtubules of centrioles.. Inhibition of tubulin subunits disso-
ciation (disassembly) by addition of D2O, or stimulation this process by decreas-
ing temperature or increasing hydrostatic pressure stops cell mitosis - division
(Alberts et al., 1983).

The above mentioned factors enable to aﬀect the A ⇔ B equilibrium of cav-
ity between α and β tubulins, composing microtubules. These factors action
conﬁrm our hypothesis, that microtubules assembly are mediated by cluster-
philic interaction (see section 17.5 of [1] and paper [5]).

The decrease in temperature and increase in intra-microtubules pressure lead
to the increased dimensions of librational water eﬀectons, clustrons and ﬁnally
this induce disassembly of microtubules.

Microtubules are responsible for the coordination of intra-cell space organi-
zation and movements, including chromosome movement at the mitotic cycle,
coordinated by centrioles.

The communication between diﬀerent cells by means of channels can regulate

the ionic concentration and correspondent aH2O gradients in the embryo.

In accordance with our hypothesis, the gradient of water activity,
regulated by change of vicinal water fraction in diﬀerent compart-
ments of cell can play a role of so-called morphogenic factor necessary
for diﬀerentiation of embryo cells.

8. Water and cancer

We put forward a hypothesis that unlimited cancer cell division
is related to partial disassembly of cytoskeleton’s actin-like ﬁlaments
due to some genetically controlled mistakes in biosynthesis and in-
creasing the osmotic diﬀusion of water into transformed cell.

35

Decreasing of the intra-cell concentration of any types of ions (N a+, K +, H +,
M g2+ etc.), as the result of corresponding ionic pump destruction, incorporated
in biomembranes, also may lead to disassembly of ﬁlaments.

The shift of equilibrium: [assembly ⇔ disassembly] of microtubules (MTs)
and actin ﬁlaments to the right increases the amount of intra-cell water, involved
in hydration shells of protein and decreases water activity. As a consequence of
concomitant osmotic process, cells tend to swell and acquire a ball-like shape.
The number of direct contacts between transformed cells decrease and the water
activity in the intercell space increases also.

We suppose that certain decline in the external inter-cell water
activity could be a triggering signal for the inhibition of normal cell
division. The shape of normal cells under control of cell’s ﬁlament
is a speciﬁc one, providing good dense intercell contacts with limited
amount of water, in contrast to transformed cells.

If this idea is true, the absence of contact inhibition in the case
of cancer cells is a result of insuﬃcient decreasing of intercell water
activity due to loose [cell-cell] contacts.

If our model of cancer emergency is correct, then the problem of
tumor inhibition is related to the problem of inter - and intra-cell
water activity regulation by means of chemical and physical factors.

Another approach for cancer healing we can propose here is the
IR laser treatment of transformed cells with IR photons frequencies,
stimulating superdeformons excitation and collective disassembly of
MTs in composition of centrioles. This will prevent cells division
and should have a good therapeutic eﬀect. This approach is based
on assumption that stability of MTs in transformed cells is weaker
and/or resonant frequency of their superdeformons excitation diﬀers
from that of normal cells.

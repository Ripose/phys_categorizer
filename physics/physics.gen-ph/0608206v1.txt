The new dynamical theory of space is further conﬁrmed by showing that the
black hole masses MBH in 19 spherical star systems, from globular clusters to
galaxies with masses M , satisfy the prediction that MBH = α
2 M , where α is
the ﬁne structure constant. As well the necessary and unique generalisations of
the Schr¨odinger and Dirac equations permit the ﬁrst derivation of gravity from
a deeper theory, showing that gravity is a quantum eﬀect of quantum matter
interacting with the dynamical space. As well the necessary generalisation of
Maxwell’s equations displays the observed light bending eﬀects. Finally it is
shown from the generalised Dirac equation where the spacetime mathematical
formalism, and the accompanying geodesic prescription for matter trajectories,
comes from. The new theory of space is non-local and we see many parallels
between this and quantum theory, in addition to the ﬁne structure constant
manifesting in both, so supporting the argument that space is a quantum
foam system, as implied by the deeper information-theoretic theory known as
Process Physics. The spatial dynamics also provides an explanation for the
‘dark matter’ eﬀect and as well the non-locality of the dynamics provides a
mechanism for generating the uniformity of the universe, so explaining the
cosmological horizon problem.

Introduction

Physics has had two distinct approaches to space. Newton asserted that space existed, but was non-
dynamical and unobservable. Einstein, in contrast, asserted that space was merely an illusion, a perspec-
tive eﬀect in that it is four-dimensional spacetime which is real and dynamical, and that the foliation
into space and a geometrical model of time was observer dependent; there was no observer independent
space. Hence according to Einstein also space was necessarily unobservable. However both approaches
have been challenged by the recent discovery that space had been detected again and again over more
than 100 years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], and that the dynamics of space is now established1. The
key discovery [2] in 2002 was that the speed of light is anisotropic - that it is c only with respect to
space itself, and that the solar system has a large speed of some 400km/s relative to that space, which
causes the observed anisotropy. This discovery changes all of physics. The problem had been that from
the very beginning the various gas-mode Michelson interferometer experiments to detect this anisotropy
had been incorrectly calibrated2, and that the small fringe shifts actually seen corresponded to this high
speed. Then since space existed it must also have a dynamics, and this dynamics has been discovered
and tested by explaining various phenomena such as (i) gravity, (ii) the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, (iii) the bore
hole g anomalies, (iv) novel black holes, (v) light bending and gravitational lensing in general, and so
on. Because space has been overlooked in physics as a dynamical aspect of reality all of the fundamental
equations of physics, such as Maxwell’s equations, the Schr¨odinger equation, the Dirac equation and so

1At least in the limit of zero vorticity.
2The gas in the light paths plays a critical part in determining the calibration. In vacuum mode the interferometer is

completely insensitive to absolute motion eﬀects, i.e. to the anisotropy of light.

on, all lacked the notion that the phenomena described by these equations were excitations, of various
kinds, of the dynamical space itself. The generalisation of the Schr¨odinger equation [12] then gave the ﬁrst
derivation and explanation for gravity: it is a quantum eﬀect in which the wave functions are refracted
by the inhomogeneities and time variations of the structured space. However the most striking discovery
is that the internal dynamics of space is determined by the ﬁne structure constant [13, 14, 15, 16]. In this
paper we report further observational evidence for this discovery by using a more extensive collection of
black hole masses in spherical galaxies and globular clusters. As well we give a more insightful explanation
for the dynamics of space. We also show how this quantum-theoretic explanation for gravity leads to a
derivation of the spacetime construct where, we emphasise, this is purely a mathematical construct and
not an aspect of reality. This is important as it explains why the spacetime dynamics appeared to be
successful, at least in those cases where the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect was not apparent. However in general the
metric tensor of this induced spacetime does not satisfy the General Relativity (GR) equations.

2 Dynamics of Space

At a deeper level an information-theoretic approach to modelling reality (Process Physics [1]) leads to an
emergent space which is 3-dimensional and dynamic, but where the 3-dimensionality is only approximate,
in that if we ignore non-trivial topological aspects of space, then it may be embedded in a 3-dimensional
geometrical manifold. Here the space is a real existent discrete but fractal network of relationships or con-
nectivities, but the embedding space is purely a mathematical way of characterising the 3-dimensionality
of the network. This is illustrated in Fig.1. A key point is that this is not an ether model; that notion
involved a duality in that both the ether and the space in which it was embedded were both real. Now
the key point is that how we embed the network in the embedding space is very arbitrary: we could
equally well rotate the embedding or use an embedding that has the network translating. These general
requirements then dictate the minimal dynamics for the actual network, at a phenomenological level.
To see this we assume at a coarse grained level that the dynamical patterns within the network may
be described by a velocity ﬁeld v(r, t), where r is the location of a ‘point’ in the network according to
some arbitrary embedding. For simplicity we assume here that the global topology of the network is not
signiﬁcant for the local dynamics, and so we embed in an E3, although a generalisation to an embedding
in S3 is straightforward. The minimal dynamics then follows from the above by writing down the lowest
order zero-rank tensors that are invariant under translation and rotation, giving3

In Process Physics quantum matter are topological defects in the network, but here it is suﬃcient to
give a simple description in terms of an eﬀective density, but which can also model the ‘dark energy’ eﬀect
and electromagnetic energy eﬀects, which will be discussed elsewhere. We see that there are only four
possible terms, and so we need at most three possible constants to describe the dynamics of space: G, α
and β. G will turn out to be Newton’s gravitational constant, and describes the rate of ﬂow of space into
matter. To determine the values of α and β we must, at this stage, turn to experimental data.

However most experimental data involving the dynamics of space is observed by detecting the so-called
gravitational acceleration of matter, although increasingly light bending is giving new information. Now
3Note that then the spatial dynamics cannot involve the speed of light c, except on the RHS where relativistic eﬀects
come into play if the speed of matter relative to the local space becomes large, see [1]. This has signiﬁcant implications for
the nature and speed of gravitational waves.

Figure 1: This is an iconic graphical representation of how a dynamical network has its inherent approximate
3-dimensionality displayed by an embedding in a mathematical space such as an E3 or an S3. This space is not
real; it is purely a mathematical artifact. Nevertheless this embeddability helps determine the minimal dynamics
for the network, as in (1). At a deeper level the network is a quantum foam system [1]. The dynamical space is
not an ether model, as the embedding space does not exist.

the acceleration a of the dynamical patterns in space is given by the Euler or convective expression

and this appears in one of the terms in (1). As shown in [12] and discussed later herein the acceleration
g of quantum matter is identical to this acceleration, apart from vorticity and relativistic eﬀects, and so
the gravitational acceleration of matter is also given by (3).

Outside of a spherically symmetric distribution of matter, of total mass M , we ﬁnd that one solution

of (1) is the velocity in-ﬂow ﬁeld given by4

but only when β =

α. Then the acceleration of matter induced by this in-ﬂow is

which is Newton’s Inverse Square Law of 1687, but with an eﬀective mass that is diﬀerent from the actual
mass M . So Newton’s law requires β =
α in (1) although at present a deeper explanation has not been
found. But we also see modiﬁcations coming from the α-dependent terms.

−

A major recent discovery [13, 14, 15, 16] has been that experimental data from the bore hole g anomaly
1/137. This

has revealed that α is the ﬁne structure constant, to within experimental errors: α = e2/¯hc

where d is the depth and ρ is the density, being that of glacial ice in the case of the Greenland Ice Shelf

where ρDM is an eﬀective matter density that would be required to mimic the α-dependent spatial self-
interaction dynamics. Then (7) is the diﬀerential form for Newton’s law of gravity but with an additional
non-matter eﬀective matter density. It has been shown [13, 14, 15, 16] that this eﬀect explains the so-
called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies. As shown elsewhere it also explains, when used with the
generalised Maxwell’s equations, the gravitational lensing of light by this ‘dark matter’ eﬀect.

An intriguing aspect to the spatial dynamics is that it is non-local. Historically this was ﬁrst noticed by
Newton who called it action-at-a-distance. To see this we can write (1) as an integro-diﬀerential equation

This shows a high degree of non-locality and non-linearity, and in particular that the behaviour of both
ρDM and ρ manifest at a distance irrespective of the dynamics of the intervening space. This non-local
behaviour is analogous to that in quantum systems. The non-local dynamics associated with the α
dynamics has been tested in various situations, as discussed herein, and so its validity is well established.
This implies that the minimal spatial dynamics in (1) involves non-local connectivities.

We term the dynamics of space in (1) as a ‘ﬂowing space’. This term can cause confusion because in
normal language a ‘ﬂow’ implies movement of something relative to a background space; but here there
is no existent background space, only the non-existent mathematical embedding space. So here the ‘ﬂow’
refers to internal relative motion, that one parcel of space has a motion relative to a nearby parcel of
space. Hence the absolute velocities in (1) have no observable meaning; that despite appearances it is
only the relative velocities that have any dynamical signiﬁcance. Of course it is this requirement that
determined the form of (1), and as implemented via the embedding space technique.

However there is an additional role for the embedding space, namely as a coordinate system used by a
set of cooperating observers. But again while this is useful for their discourse it is not real; it is not part
of reality.

3 Black Holes

Equation (1) has black hole solutions. There are two categories: (i) an in-ﬂow singularity induced by the
ﬂow into a matter system, such as a spherical galaxy or globular cluster. These black holes are termed

minimal black holes, as their eﬀective mass is minimal, (ii) primordial naked black holes which then attract
matter. These result in spiral galaxies, and the eﬀective mass of the black hole is larger than required
merely by the matter induced in-ﬂow. These are therefore termed non-minimal black holes. These explain
the rapid formation of structure in the early universe. The term ‘black hole’ is used because they have
an event horizon where the in-ﬂow speed equals the speed of light, but in other respects they diﬀer from
the putative black holes of General Relativity - in particular their gravitational acceleration is not inverse
square law. This is the feature that explains the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies. Here we
consider only the minimal black holes.

Consider the case where we have a spherically symmetric matter distribution, and that the in-ﬂow is
time-independent and radially symmetric. Then (1) is best analysed via (9), which can now be written
in the form

in which the angle integrations may be done to yield

where with v′ = dv(r)/dr

To obtain the induced in-ﬂow singularity to O(α) we substitute the non-α term in (11) into (12) giving
the eﬀective matter density that mimics the spatial self-interaction of the in-ﬂow,

We see that the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect is concentrated near the centre, and we ﬁnd that the total ‘dark
matter’ is

This result applies to any spherically symmetric matter distribution, and is the original of the α terms
in (4) and (5). It is thus responsible for the bore hole anomaly expression in (6). This means that the
bore hole anomaly is indicative of an in-ﬂow singularity at the centre of the earth. This contributes some
0.4% of the eﬀective mass of the earth, as deﬁned by Newtonian gravity. However in star systems this
minimal black hole eﬀect is more apparent, and we label MDM as MBH . Table 1 shows the black hole
masses attributed to various spherically symmetric star systems based upon observations and analysis of
the motion of gases and stars in these systems. The prediction of the dynamics of space is that these
masses should obey (14). The data from Table 1 is plotted in Fig.2, and we see the high precision to which
(14) is indeed satisﬁed, and over some 6 orders of magnitude, giving from this data that α = 1/137.4.

The application of the spatial dynamics to spiral galaxies is discussed in [13, 14, 15, 16] where it is
shown that a complete non-matter explanation of the spiral galaxy rotation speed anomaly is given: there
is no such stuﬀ as ‘dark matter’ - it is an α determined spatial self-interaction eﬀect. Essentially even
in the non-relativistic regime the Newtonian theory of gravity, with its ‘universal’ Inverse Square Law, is
deeply ﬂawed.

4 Spacetime

The curved spacetime explanation for gravity is widely known. Here an explanation for its putative success
is given, for there is a natural deﬁnition of a spacetime space that arises from (1), but that it is purely a
mathematical construction with no ontological status - it is a mere mathematical artifact.

First consider the generalised Schr¨odinger [12]

where the free-fall hamiltonian is

As discussed in [12] this is uniquely deﬁned by the requirement that the wave function be attached to
the dynamical space, and not to the embedding space, which is a mere mathematical artifact. We can
compute the acceleration of a localised wave packet according to

v0 is the velocity of the wave packet relative to the local space, as v0 is the velocity
where vR = v
relative to the embedding space. Apart from the vorticity term which causes rotation of the wave packet
we see, as promised, that this matter acceleration is equal to that of the space itself, as in (3). This is the
ﬁrst derivation of the phenomenon of gravity from a deeper theory: gravity is a quantum eﬀect - namely
the refraction of quantum waves by the internal diﬀerential motion of the substructure patterns to space
itself. Note that the equivalence principle has now been explained, as this ‘gravitational’ acceleration is
independent of the mass m of the quantum system.

An analogous generalisation of the Dirac equation is also necessary giving the coupling of the spinor
to the actual dynamical space, and again not to the embedding space as has been the case up until now,

which generalises (17) by having a term which limits the speed of the wave packet relative to space to be

We shall now show how this leads to both the spacetime mathematical construct and that the geodesic
for matter worldlines in that spacetime is equivalent to trajectories from (19). First we note that (19)

with respect to the particle trajectory [1]. This happens because of the Fermat least-time eﬀect for waves:
only along the minimal time trajectory do the quantum waves remain in phase under small variations
of the path. This again emphasises that gravity is a quantum eﬀect. We now introduce a spacetime
mathematical construct according to the metric

and the minimisation of (22) leads to the geodesics of the spacetime, which are thus equivalent to the
trajectories from (20). Hence by coupling the Dirac spinor dynamics to the space dynamics we derive
the geodesic formalism of General Relativity as a quantum eﬀect, but without reference to the Hilbert-
Einstein equations for the induced metric. Indeed in general the metric of this induced spacetime will
not satisfy these equations as the dynamical space involves the α-dependent dynamics, and α is missing
from GR. So why did GR appear to succeed in a number of key tests where the Schwarzschild metric was
used? The answer is provided by identifying the induced spacetime metric corresponding to the in-ﬂow
in (4) outside of a spherical matter system, such as the earth. Then (21) becomes

which is the Schwarzschild metric but with the α-dynamics induced eﬀective mass shift. Hence in the
case of the Schwarzschild metric the dynamics missing from both the Newtonian theory of gravity and
General Relativity is merely hidden in a mass redeﬁnition, and so didn’t aﬀect the various standard tests
of GR, or even of Newtonian gravity. Note that as well we see that the Schwarzschild metric is none
other than Newtonian gravity, except for the mass shift. So the whole GR formalism has been one of
great confusion. While we have now explained why the GR formalism appeared to work, it is also clear
that this formalism hides the manifest dynamics of the dynamical space, and which has also been directly
detected in gas-mode interferometer and coaxial-cable experiments.

One of the putative key tests of the GR formalism was the gravitational bending of light. This also
immediately follows from the new space dynamics once we also generalise the Maxwell equations so that
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are excitations of the dynamical space. The dynamics of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds must then have the form, in empty space,

which was ﬁrst suggested by Hertz in 1888 [32]. As discussed elsewhere the speed of EM radiation is
now c = 1/√µǫ with respect to the space, and in general not with respect to the observer if the observer
is moving through space, as experiment has indicated again and again. In particular the in-ﬂow in (4)
causes a refraction eﬀect of light passing close to the sun, with the angle of deﬂection given by

where v is the in-ﬂow speed at the surface of the sun, and d is the impact parameter, essentially the radius
10−6 radians is actually a measure of the in-ﬂow speed
of the sun. Hence the observed deﬂection of 8.4
at the sun’s surface, and that gives v = 615km/s. At the earth distance the sun induced spatial in-ﬂow
speed is 42km/s, and this has been extracted from the 1925/26 gas-mode interferometer Miller data [1, 3].
These radial in-ﬂows are to be vectorially summed to the galactic ﬂow of some 420km/s, but since that

ﬂow is much more uniform it does not aﬀect the light bending by the sun in-ﬂow component6. Hence the
deﬂection of light by the sun is a way of directly measuring the in-ﬂow speed at the sun’s surface, and
has nothing to do with curved spacetime. These generalised Maxwell equations also predict gravitational
lensing produced by the large in-ﬂows associated with black holes in galaxies. So again this eﬀect permits
the direct observation of the new black hole eﬀects with their non-inverse square law accelerations.

5 Conclusions

We have shown how minimal assumptions about the internal dynamics of space, namely how embeddability
in a mathematical space, such as an E3 or an S3, expresses its inherent 3-dimensionality, leads to various
predictions ranging from the anisotropy of the speed of light, as expressed in the required generalisation
of Maxwell’ s equations, and which has been repeatedly observed since the Michelson-Morley experiment
[5] of 1887, to the derivation of the phenomenon of gravity that follows after we generalise the Schr¨odinger
and Dirac equations. This shows that the gravitational acceleration of matter is a quantum eﬀect:
it
follows from the refraction of quantum waves in the inhomogeneities and time-dependencies of the ﬂowing
dynamical space. In particular the analysis shows that the acceleration of quantum matter is identical
to the convective acceleration of the structured space itself. This is a non-trivial result. As well in the
case of the Dirac equation we derive the spacetime formalism as well as the geodesic description of matter
trajectories, but in doing so reveal that the spacetime is merely a mathematical construct.

Here we have further extended the observational evidence that it is the ﬁne structure constant that
determines the strength of the spatial self-interaction in this new physics by including data from black
hole masses in 19 spherical star systems. Elsewhere we have already shown that the new space dynam-
ics explains also the spiral galaxy rotation velocity anomaly; that it is not caused by an new form of
matter, that the notion of ‘dark matter’ is just a failure of Newtonian gravity and GR. We have also
shown that the space dynamics is non-local, a feature that Newton called action-at-a-distance. This is
now extended to include the eﬀects of the spatial self-interaction. The numerous conﬁrmations of that
dynamics, summarised herein, demonstrates the validity of this non-local physics. Of course since Newton
we have become more familiar with non-local eﬀects in the quantum theory. The new space dynamics
shows that non-local eﬀects are more general than just subtle eﬀects in the quantum theory, for in the
space dynamics this non-local dynamics is responsible for the supermassive black holes in galaxies. This
non-local dynamics is responsible for two other eﬀects: (i) that the dynamics of space within an event
horizon, say enclosing a black hole in-ﬂow singularity aﬀects the space outside of the horizon, even though
EM radiation and matter cannot propagate out through the event horizon, as there the in-ﬂow speed
exceeds the speed of light. So in this new physics we have the escape of information from within the event
horizon, and (ii) that the universe overall is more highly connected than previously thought. This may
explain why the universe is more uniform than expected on the basis of interactions limited by the speed
of light, i.e we probably have a solution to the cosmological horizon problem.

Elsewhere [1] we have argued that the dynamical space has the form of a quantum foam and so non-
local quantum eﬀects are to be expected. So it might be argued that the successful prediction of the
masses of these black hole masses, and their dependence on the ﬁne structure constant, is indicative of a
grand uniﬁcation of space and the quantum theory. This uniﬁcation is not coming from the quantisation
of gravity, but rather from a deeper modelling of reality as an information-theoretic system with emergent
quantum-space and quantum matter.

6The vector superposition eﬀect for spatial ﬂows is only approximate, and is discussed in more detail in [33]. The solar

system has a galactic velocity of some 420±30km/s in the direction RA=5.2hr, Dec=-670.

Newton Equations May Be Treated as Diﬀusion Equations in the Real Time and
Space Fields of Multifractal Universe (Masses are Diﬀusion Coeﬃcients of

In thirties years of last century Dirac proposed to treat Shr¨odinger equation as the equation of
diﬀusion with imaginary diﬀusion coeﬃcient. In the frame of multifractal theory of time and space
( in this model our the multifractal universe is consisting of real time and space ﬁelds) in the works
[1]- [16] was analyzed how the fractional dimensions of real ﬁelds of time and space inﬂuence on
behavior of diﬀerent physical phenomena. In this paper the Newton equations of the multifractal
universe (considered for the ﬁrst time in [1]- [3]) are generalized and is treated as the equations
of diﬀusion with mass of bodies (depending of fractional dimension of place, where these bodies
located) as a coeﬃcient of diﬀusion. The realization of this point of view for inhomogeneous time
equations ( the analogies of Newton equations) is carried out too. The last lead to introducing new
sort of masses: the masses that characterize the inertia of inhomogeneous time ﬂows with space
coordinates changing.

I. INTRODUCTION

This paper based on some concepts of physical mod-
els of the theory of multifractal time and space which
are consequences of this theory (Kobelev [1]- [16]). The
multifractal model of space and time treats the time and
the space with fractional dimensions as real ﬁelds. Uni-
verse is formed only by these ﬁelds , i.e.our universe is
the fractional real material time and fractional real mate-
rial space. All other ﬁelds are born by the ﬁelds of time
and space by means of their fractional dimensions. As
the time and the space are material ﬁelds with fractional
dimensions and multifractal structure (multifractal sets,)
they are deﬁned on the sets of their carriers of measure
(physical vacuum for our universe which born her when
”big-bang” happened). In each the time (or the space)
point ( ”points” are approach for very small ”intervals”
of time or space and ”intervals” are the multifractal sets
with global dimensions for their sets, that play role of
local dimensions for universe in whole) the dimensions of
time (or space) determine the densities of Lagrangians
energy for all physical ﬁelds ( or new physical ﬁelds for
space) in these points. Time and space are binding by
relation dr2 − c2dt2 = 0 (this relation is only a good ap-
proach, more precise relations see at [2]). The purpose of
this paper is consideration of very interesting problem (

in the frame of mathematical formalism of the multifrac-
tal model of time and space introduced in the papers of
Kobelev and presented in [1]- [16]): may masses of bod-
ies be treated as characteristic of the real space that are
analogies of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient ? Such interpretation
will be the analogy of Dirac interpretation of Shr¨odinger
equation. In that case main equations of modern physics
(Newton and Shr¨odinger equations) are the analogy of
diﬀusion equation and their nature caused by diﬀusion
processes in the real time and space ﬁelds of our multi-
fractal universe.

functions on which the generalized fractional derivatives
concept is applicable. These equations do not present
a closed system because of the fractionality of spatial
dimensions. Therefore we approximate the fractional
derivatives with respect to space coordinate as Ddr
+,r ≈ ∇,
i.e. approximate by usual space derivatives. In the Eqs.
(1)-(2) is used the integral functionals Ddt
+,t (both left-
sided and right-sided) which are suitable to describe the
dynamics of functions deﬁned on multifractal sets (see
[1]- [3]). These functionals are simple and natural gener-
alization of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives
and integrals and read:

(4)

where Γ(x) is Euler’s gamma function, and a and b are
some constants which take values from interval (0, ∞).
In these deﬁnitions, as usually, n = {d} + 1 , where {d}
is the integer part of d if d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤ d < n) and
n = 0 for d < 0. If d = const, the generalized fractional
derivatives (GFD) (3)-(4) coincide with the Riemann -
Liouville fractional derivatives (d ≥ 0) or fractional inte-
grals (d < 0). When d = n + ε(t), ε(t) → 0, GFD can be
represented by means of integer derivatives and integrals.
For n = 1, i.e. d = 1 + ε, |ε| << 1 it is possible to obtain:

+a

[ε(r(t), t)f (r(t), t)] +

∂
∂t

ε(r(t), t)f (r(t), t)

(5)

where a is a constant and determined by choice of the
rules of regularization of integrals ( [1]- [2], [7]) (for more
detailed see [7]) and the last member in the right hand
side of (5) is very small. The selection of the rules of reg-
ularization that gives a real additives for usual derivative
in (3) yields a = 0.5 or a = 1 for d < 1 [1]. The functions
under the integral sign in the (3)-(4) we consider as the
generalized functions deﬁned on the set of the ﬁnite or
Gelfand functions [21]. The notions of the GFD, similar
to (3)-(4), can also be deﬁned and for the space variables
r. The deﬁnitions of GFD (3)-(4) need in the connec-
tions between the fractal dimensions of time dt(r(t), t)
and the characteristics of physical ﬁelds (say, potentials
Φi(r(t), t), i = 1, 2, ..) or densities of Lagrangians Li) and
such connections were deﬁned in the cited works. Follow-
ing [1]- [15], we deﬁne this connections by the relation

dt(r(t), t) = 1 +

βiLi(Φi(r(t), t))

(6)

Xi

where Li are densities of energy (Lagrangian densities) of
physical ﬁelds, βi are dimensional constants with physical

dimension of [Li]−1 (it is worth to choose β′
i in the form
β′
i = a−1βi for the sake of independence from the regu-
larization constant and select the β = M c2 where M is
the mass of the body that born considered gravitational
ﬁeld). The deﬁnition of the time as the system of subsets
and deﬁnition of the FD for dt (see (6)) connects the value
of fractional (fractal) dimension dt(r(t), t) with each time
instant t. The latter depends both on time t and coor-
dinates r. If dt = 1 (an absence of physical ﬁelds) the
set of time has topological dimension equal to unity. For
large energy densities (e.g.,for cases when gravitational
ﬁeld is large (the domain of space where r < r0) Eqs.(1)-
(2) contain no divergencies [1] since integral-diﬀerential
operators of the generalized fractional diﬀerentiation are
reduced to the generalized fractional integrals (see (1)).
We bound the consideration only by the case when rela-
tions dt = 1−ε(r(t), t)), |ε| ≪ 1 are fulﬁlled. In that case
the GFD (as was shown in [7] ) may be represented (as
a good approach) by ordinary derivatives and relations
(1), (5) are valid. Now we can determine the dt for dis-
tances much larger than the gravitational radius r0 (for
the problem of a body motion in the ﬁeld of spherical-
symmetric gravitating center) as (see [1] for more details)

dt ≈ 1 + βgΦg + βΦm

(7)

where Φg is the gravitational potential of mass M and
Φm is the gravitational potential born by the body with
mass m in its center. So the equations (1)-(2) reed ( we
used for GFD approach of (5) [16])

We had neglected by the fractional parts of spatial di-
mensions and by the contributions from the term with
b−1
g . Now we take the βm = βg = c−2 for potentials (or
β = (M c)−2 for Lagrangian density L). Than equation
(8) gives the small corrections to Mercury perihelium ro-
tations of general relativity (see [17]). It is the example of
limited character of general relativity principle of equiv-
alence.

III. GENERALIZED NEWTON EQUATIONS
AND THEIR DIFFUSION INTERPRETATION

In this paragraph we write down the generalization
of modiﬁed Newton equations (1)-(2) in the multifrac-
tal time universe. Let the gravitational forces only is
presence . This generalization based on a quite natural
if the every point of the real spatial ﬁeld
assumption:
determines their fractional ( temporal and spatial) di-
mensions, the masses in this point (as the one of charac-
teristics of the real spatial ﬁeld) must have dependence

of the fractional dimensions in this point (i.e. at dt and
dr ). So, the Eqs. (1)-(2) will have the form

[mdt,dr Ddt(r,t)

+,t

r(t)] = Ddr

+,r[mdt,dr

]

(10)

If the mass of accelerated body md has no dependencies
(1)-(2)
of fractional dimensions the Eq.(10) and Eqs.
are coinciding. We consider now the simple method of
receiving of the equation (10) from qualitative reasoning.
Let Er is the density of energy at the point r of real space
ﬁeld. On the one hand the gradient of it gives for current
j equation

jE ∼ ∇E(r)

(11)

On another hand this current is proportional to changing
( with changing of time) of gradient E(r) in the temporal
space

jE ∼

E(r)

∂2
∂t2

(12)

The latter equation describes the diﬀusion of the energy
at space point r in the temporal space under the inﬂuence
of gradient of it. So designate a diﬀusion coeﬃcient in
temporal space as mdt,dr . We may compare now the (12)
to the (11) and separate E in the (13) into the coeﬃcient
of diﬀusion m and the space ﬁeld transferring the energy
r and replace E by gravitational energy in the (11). We
receive the Newton equations in the form (10). Thus we
have the interpretation of Newton equations as the equa-
tions are describing the masses of bodies as the diﬀusion
coeﬃcients of transferring of energy density of the real
space ﬁeld of the point r at the temporal space (at the
spatial point r) . We consider the case when it is possible
to neglect by corrections of order r0r−1 where r0 = 2γM
c2
is the gravitational radius, in the generalized fractional
derivatives and replaced them by usual derivatives, then
the Eq.(11) reads

mdt

∂md

r = ∇

(13)

In the Eq.(13) there is the additional member with
derivatives m with respect to t . This member describes
the change of mass m with time. As in the multifractal
theory of time and space (see [1]- [16]) there are no the
constant values, the appearing of this member is very
natural because all physical values in multifractal uni-
verse are changing in time. For dt = 1 + ε, ε << 1 this
member is very small and not essential.

IV. GENERALIZED INHOMOGENEOUS TIME
EQUATIONS AND THEIR DIFFUSION
INTERPRETATION

In the multifractal universe the time and the space
are real and inhomogeneous ﬁelds. So for the time t(r)

that depends of the spatial points of space ﬁeld r there
is the equation that was found for the ﬁrst time in the
If we are to take into account the fraction-
paper [1].
ality of spatial dimensions (dx 6= 1, dy 6= 1, dz 6= 1)
(see [1]- [3]), we arrive to a new class of equations that
describe ”temporal” physical ﬁelds (we shall call them
the ”temporal” ﬁelds) generated by the space with frac-
tional dimensions. These equations are quite similar to
the corresponding equations that appear due to fraction-
ality of time dimensions (the latter were given earlier). In
Eqs.(8)-(10) of paper [3], [7] we must take x = r, ; α = r
and fractal dimensions dr(t(r), r) will be described by the
Eq.(12) of this paper with t being replaced by r. Thus
for time t(r(t)) and potentials Φg(t(r), r) (analogous of
gravitational ﬁeld) the equations analogous to Newton’s
will read (here the spatial coordinates play the role of
time)

Ddr(r,t)

The equation (14) describes the changes of time born by
existence of fractionality of spatial dimensions. The mr
is the analogy of mass the mt in the ordinary Newton
equations and the last usually is treated as measure of
inertia of bodies. The fundamental constant γr is the
analogies of gravitational constant γ in ﬁeld of time. So
the mr may be treated as ”measure of temporal inertia”
when the inhomogeneous time ﬂows propagate through
diﬀerent spatial domains.
Thus there are two sorts of ”masses” in the multifractal
universe: the masses mt and the masses mr. The ﬁrst
describe the ”bodies inertia” or diﬀusion of energy of
the space with current of time. The second masses mr
describe the inhomogeneous of time ﬂows with changes of
spatial places and may be treated as diﬀusion coeﬃcient
of time energy propagation in the space of real ﬁeld r.
So in the multifractal universe the known conception of
masses is doubled and it is necessary to introduce the
new sort of masses because there are exist not only the
space energy 2Et = mt[ ∂r
∂t ]2 (non relativistic case), but
the ”time energy”

2Er = mr[

∂t
∂r

]2

(16)

This relation characterize the time energy of real time
ﬁeld at point t(r). We may construct for this ﬁeld the
special relativity of almost inertial systems in full analogy
with papers [4], [6]. For Lorentz transformation in the
real time ﬁeld than we have

In the Eqs. (17)-(18) we use designation: cr = c−1, vr =
∂t
∂x . The value a0r may be received from correspondent
the a0 of paper [4] by replacing the fractional dimensions
dt for dr. For agreement with Lorentz transformations
respect to any moving in the real space it is necessary to
∂t c−2. So there is only two unknown

values : the mr, which is determine the time diﬀusion
(or ”time inertia”) of real time ﬁeld in the multifractal
universe and temporal force F (t) with unknown γr.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The next main results is necessary to note:

1.In this paper Dirac idea about treating quantum me-
chanics as diﬀusion process (with imaginary diﬀusion
coeﬃcient) is propagated for the domain of classical
physics. The last is possible only because of real na-
ture of space and time ﬁelds in the multifractal universe;
the consideration of inhomogeneous time equations
2.
(these equations are analogies of Newton equations for
real time ﬁeld ) is based on consideration of the process
of diﬀusion of ”temporal energy” in space when there
are space coordinates changing. This energy depends of
fractional dimensions dr and when the last are changing
(that depends of changing of r) with ﬂow of time, the dr
and the temporal energy change too.
3. Generalized Newton equations for the multifractal uni-
verse is obtained;
4. Generalized temporal equation (analogy of Newton
equations for t(r)) for multifractal universe is obtained;
5. The generalized temporal masses are presented (see
also [1]- [3])
5. We pay attention once yet that if time and space treat
as convenient only marks for system of references (this
point of view contradicts the base assumption of the mul-
tifractal theory of universe about the nature of time and
space ﬁelds as the real ﬁelds) diﬀusion interpretation of
classic mechanics equations and nature of usual and the
temporal masses is impossible.

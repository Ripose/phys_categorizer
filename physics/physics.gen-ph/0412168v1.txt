A uniﬁcation scheme for classical and quantum mechanics at all velocities
(I) Fundamental Formation of Material Particles
Preface
J.Z. Johansson and P-I. Johansson (Dec. 27, 2004)

The following paper ”A uniﬁcation scheme for classical and quantum mechanics at all
velocities (I) Fundamental Formation of Material Particles” is a copy of the original
manuscript ﬁrst submitted to the Pro. Roy. Soc., February 24, 2003. Today, about
two years after, we decide to publish it as is at the E-print server.

Within the scheme for material particle formation and construction of vacuum
presented in it, numerous new researches have since been carried out, including the
Inference of Schrdinger Equation[1] and the Prediction of Gravity[2]. These all re-
aﬃrm the viability of the scheme. The new version of the manuscript on this scheme
evolves now into over 350 reprint pages; the ﬁrst volume Ref.
[3] is in printing.
Within the topics treated in the original paper, there are also major supplements:
(1) A systematic, detailed treatments for vacuum property have been supplemented.
Various discussions have been made more elaborately, or with better clarity. Some
quantitative evaluations, esp. the vacuum density, are remade on more solid ground.
(2) Some model entities are re-named. Especially ”a positive (oscillatory) elementary
charge” is named an ”aether pole” in the original paper, and is renamed in our later
papers as ”vaculeon”, and a pair of two bound aether poles of opposite signs at ground
state is renamed as a ”vacuuon”. (These changes for the better have beneﬁted from
discussions with Prof. R. Lundin.)

Readers are hoped to ﬁnd these updated contents in our recent two papers [1,2]

and later publications.

However we ﬁnd it of value to publish this original paper as is for two reasons. Firstly,
major part of the treatments, including the fundamental formation of a simple ma-
terial particle from a oscillatory elementary charge, the solution for particle mass,
the development of de Broglie wave, and the vacuum structure, remains valid. These
treatments supplement background information for our recent papers placed at the
E-print server, Refs [1]-[2] which has received a large response of interest from the
reader; but the new complete report Ref [3] is not expected to be immediately ac-
cessible to the reader. Secondly, this original paper marked with the original date of
submission/circulation (among international physicists) gives a documentation of the
original ideas and ﬁndings of the authors.

From a Newtonian mechanics solution for vacuum with a physical
structure constructed based on pivotal experimental observations and of
a Dirac kind, we have achieved a general scheme for the formation of
basic material particles. A basic particle, which may be e.g. an electron,
is composed of a tiny free bare charge and the mechanical wave distur-
bances – identifying with electromagnetic waves – generated by it in the
medium. When in motion, as a result of a ﬁrst kind source eﬀect, this
particle wave exhibits all of wave and dynamic properties known for a
de Broglie wave, and is here called a Newton- de Broglie (NdB) particle
wave. In a conﬁned space, the Newtonian solution for the NdB particle
wave is equivalent to that given by Schr¨odinger’s quantum mechanics.
Through this general scheme we have accomplished a basic task of the
uniﬁcation of the classical- and the quantum- mechanics, both in terms
of the deduction of the latter from the former, and the convergence of the
latter into the former at high velocities. Through completing the task, we
unfold the origins of a series of phenomena including the electromagnetic
waves, the electromagnetic radiation and absorption, atomic and ther-
mal excitations, the inertial mass, the Schr¨odinger’s wavefunction and
de Broglie wave, the Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation, the de Broglie re-
lations, the simultaneous existence of electron and positron or generally
of particles and their anti-particles, Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence
relation, etc. The general scheme facilitates also a Theory of Relative
Motion which we present in a separate paper, II; a series of followed
extended applications of the general scheme are planned.

I. INTRODUCTION

Newton-Maxwellian classical mechanics (1686, 1891) and quantum mechanics
(1900, 1926) have to be the governing laws for the respective macroscopic and the
microscopic physical worlds. The two mechanics remain ununited up to the present.
To reduce the various governing laws of Nature to a minimal set has been one ulti-
mate ideal of physics. Of these, a uniﬁcation of the two mechanics calls for a priority,
for the two pertain to the very elementary laws of Nature. A uniﬁcation of the two
mechanics is compelling also because they exhibit in all manifestations the bearing in
one of the other (see for example their interrelations provoked in Merzbacher, 1970).
In this paper we propose a general scheme, that facilitates a uniﬁcation of the two
mechanics at all velocities. The sacred path to the uniﬁcation as shown in this work,

is a valid representation of our physical world at a submicroscopic scale, the scale
that measures the size of the components from which the microscopic world, e.g. the
electron, is built. This foremost concerns two basic components of it, the vacuum in
which it resides, and the electromagnetic waves that are the basic processes taking
place in it. Classical and quantum mechanics have, historically, evolved as empirical
rules of observations, and have not been subjected to inﬂuence by any submicroscopic
representations of the two components. However a distorted representation of the two
components would prevent the two mechanics from converging to the true origin, since
the quantum mechanics rests upon them. In connection with the phenomenological
bases of the two mechanics are a noted sequence of outstanding questions hitherto
unanswered, including: What is the origin of mass? What physical entity is repre-
sented by Schr¨odinger’s wave function? and What is waving in Schr¨odinger’s wave
and/or a de Broglie wave? What is the nature of electromagnetic waves? What phya-
sical entity does an electromagnetic wave turn to after being absorbed by an electron,
or from what physical entity it convert when being emitted by an electron?

To rest our project on a realistic ground from the outset, we ﬁrst survey in Sec. II
the overall experimental indications of the nature of the two basic components. To
reconcile with the observational facts our conceptions regarding the nature of vacuum
and electromagnetic waves, we propose in Sec. III a submicroscopic representation of
them, through a proposition, its corollaries, and predictions. This sketches a general
scheme for the construction of basic material particles conforming to experimental
observations. Following our general scheme we then concretely, formally elucidate in
Secs. IV -V the formation of the basic material particles, the electron and the proton,
in terms of the solutions of Newtonian mechanics for vacuum under a given pertur-
bation, at the submicroscopic scale; we thereby infer the governing mechanical law
of the particles motion and dynamics, which proves to be equivalent to Schr¨odinger’s
quantum mechanics.
In this paper, we restrict ourselves to particles at rest or in
motion of a velocity v << light velocity, c, relative to vacuum. In a separate paper, II
(Zheng-Johansson and Johansson, 2002), we infer from the present general scheme, as
supplemented with further relevant experimental evidence, the governing law of coor-
dinate transformation for particles and large body moving at high velocities compared
to c, called Galleon-Lorentz transformation, which together with the theoretical basis
gives rise to a consistent theory of relative motion. The theory predicts naturally the
observational phenomena including the null/constant fringe shift of the Michelson-
Morley/Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, the Doppler eﬀect of electromagnetic waves,
and the equivalence of Newton’s laws of motion in all inertial frames, etc, and conveys
the uniﬁcation scheme for the two mechanics here to a velocity regime up to c.

The general scheme contains a built-in scheme for also inference of Schr¨odinger’s
wave equation, Pauli exclusion principle, microscopic theory of gravity, and the uniﬁ-
cation of the four forces, etc. We will elucidate these in a series of followed reports.

II. EXPERIMENTAL INDICATION OF THE SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY
OF VACUUM

That vacuum is substantial and not empty has already been reiterated in Dirac’s
well-known theory of electrons and positrons (1926, 1933); and Dirac’s theory formed
the basis for Quantum Electrodynamics (QE). A substantial vacuum is nevertheless
not appreciated or held in all realms of physics today, such as in relativity as well as

3

within QE. In this section we survey the key experimental indications of a substantial
vacuum, which will serve direct input information for the followed construction of
vacuum structure—that is essentially a further detailing of Dirac’s vacuum.

1. An electron-positron pair can be produced out of and annihilated into vacuum when
under the ”interaction” of nucleus’ Coulomb ﬁeld.

The pair annihilation process, occurring say at a separation ra, writes:

e− + e+

γ + γ.

→

(1)

(2)

We stress that the opposite-signed bare electric charges of the electron and positron
as in (1), or its reverse process, are substantial entities (Ref. [a]), as can be directly
justiﬁed as follows. By Coulomb’s law two electric charges—dressed with mass until
annihilation—separated r apart presents to each other a potential energy (in vacuum)
e2/4πε0r. Supposing no external force presents, then the two charges must
U (r) =
U ) to
also have a kinetic energy (relative to Ua = U (ra); cf. FIG. 1)
(Ua −
maintain separated r apart without collapsing. If now r is reduced to r′, then U will be
deepened to a more negative U ′(= U (r′)) changing by ∆U (< 0) (i.e.
is increased
to
= ∆U , an
=
adiabatic conversion from ∆U . The above rewrites as

(2) states that the total mechanical energy of the two charges remains unchanged from
r to r′, conforming to the Law of Energy Conservation. The energy conservation, (2),
ought to hold true at all r, including at the ra of the annihilated pair, at which:
U (ra) = Ua,
(ra) = 0. In (1), the rest-masses of the electron and positron (assumed
at rest upon annihilation), Me− and Me+ – and not the electric potential energy U (ra)
– convert to detached gamma rays. To re-stress: the released two γ’s in (1 ) do not
originate from Ua; the Ua at ra is the same on the left and right sides of Eq. (2) The
two electric charges carry therefore a total energy (
= constant), and
are therefore substantial entities, both before and after the annihilation. Before the
annihilation each ”charge” consists of two distinct physical entities – a ”mass” and
a ”bare charge”; afterwards each is left with a bare charge only. Besides the two γ’s,
(1) informs that the two annihilated charges have become a component of vacuum –
one that can be assigned to any point (at the atto-scale) in vacuum. Hence we are
led to that, vacuum may be ﬁlled of such components. In other terms, vacuum can be
represented as consisting of substantial entities comprising (1) paired electric charges
at ra apart and (2) the Coulomb energy U (ra) they carry.

2. The speed of light, c, in vacuum is ﬁnite as contrasted to inﬁnite.

This observational fact implies that the vacuum medium has a ﬁnite inertia, and
is therefore not empty; see also Whittaker (1960). Compare the velocity of electro-
magnetic waves (in vacuum), c =
1/ǫoµo, with the velocity of a sound wave in a
material medium: cs =
F/ρm (continuum limit). We see that in the former the
product of the constants of vacuum ǫo, µo play the role of linear mass density of the

p

p

4

vacuum, corresponding to the µo for the material medium, with a reduced resorting
force equal to 1.

3. A material medium presents to the electromagnetic waves an inertia only a factor of a
few greater than that of the vacuum medium.

In other terms, a material medium immersed in vacuum owes a basic quantity
2 to the ma-
of its inertia to the vacuum, and owes only an additional factor 1
terial’s own presence. This character is directly expressible by the equation of re-
fraction index, that connects the light velocities, c in vacuum and cn in a material
medium of a refraction index n, by: cn = c/n. Making analogy to the mechani-
F/ρn and in vacuum:
cal wave propagation, light velocity in a material is: cn =
c = √ǫrcn =
F/ρ, where ρ = ρr/ǫr. That is, the mass density of
vacuum, ρ, is only a factor 1/ǫr lesser than that of the material medium, ρn. ǫr, the
p
dielectric constant, is typically 1

2 for normal dispersion curves of all materials.

F/(ρn/ǫr) =

p

4. The electromagnetic waves are analogous in all exhibitions to mechanical waves.

Long before the atomic model of matters, by treating electromagnetic waves as wave
disturbances through solids composed of coupled oscillators, Sellmeier satisfactorily
predicted the experimental dispersion curves, known as Sellmeier’s Equation (1871).
Since the establishment of the atomic model of matters, a variety of processes involving
electromagnetic waves, such as their absorption/desorption by atoms or the condensed
forms of these, have been uniformly understood to result from the motion process of
atomic oscillators. These share a united ”atomic model of matters” as the propagation
of mechanical waves in the media of the matters. The microscopic mechanical scheme
for the propagation of electromagnetic waves, in vacuum or a material medium, is
however alone left out ununited to-date.

5. The substantial nature of vacuum is pointed to by the null fringe shift of the
Michelson-Morley experiment and the Doppler eﬀect of electromagnetic waves.

In Paper II we show that, the null fringe shift in the Michelson-Morley experiment
(Michelson, 1881) can be consistently predicted based on Newtonian solutions for
electromagnetic waves propagating through a substantial vacuum medium. We fur-
thermore show that Doppler eﬀect can be consistently predicted for electromagnetic
waves with the same propagation scheme.

6. New experimental observations in recent years furthermore point to that vacuum has a
physical property

The current interest in a realistic understanding of vacuum may be reﬂected by
citing J. Marburger (2002): ”Who ever would have guessed 40 years ago that un-
derstanding the vacuum - . . . - would be the most challenging problem in physics

5

today? The discovery in 1998 that the expansion of the universe is accelerating is
both embarrassing and exciting . . . ”.

III. THE PROPERTIES OF VACUUM: PROPOSITIONS 1-2 AND THE
COROLLARIES; THEIR FACILITATING THE FORMATION OF BASIC
MATERIAL PARTICLES

Based on the experimental indications regarding the substantial nature of vacuum
and the origin of electromagnetic waves discussed in Sec.
II we construct at the
submicroscopic scale the vacuum structure — which is essentially a detailing of Dirac’s
vacuum — as follows.

Proposition 1. The Structure of Vacuum:

1.1. Vacuum is uniformly ﬁlled of a sea of neutral bare-charge pairs

which are at complete rest if no external disturbance presents.

1.2. A bare-charge pair consists of a negative bare-charge, having a
e, and a positive bare-charge having a posi-

negative electric charge,
tive electric charge, +e.

−

1.3. The magnitude of e equals one electron charge, i.e. e = 1.602

10−19 C as determined from experiment (R.A.Millikan, 1909)).

·

1.4. The negative bare-charge of a neutral bare-charge pair forms an
envelope about the positive bare-charge concentrated at the core. The
negative-, positive- bare-charges are eﬀectively separated at ra apart.

We refer to the negative bare-charge and the positive bare-charge each as a bare-
charge . If needing for distinction, we refer to the charge of a charged particle as
a bare charge (e.g., the negative bare-charge is equivalent to the electron without
regard to its mass), and the charge of a material particle (e.g. an electron) having
been associated with a mass as a mass-dressed charge. We refer to a bare-charge
elevated to an energy Eq above the vacuum level (see FIG. 1, also Cor. 5) as a
free bare-charge. A bound negative bare-charge or positive bare-charge within an
bare-charge pair is ”mass”-less (as it has a zero kinetic energy here relative to Ua; see
Sec. IV E-IV H about how mass is connected to energy).

The negative or positive bare-charge may be constructed in further details. The
general scheme facilitates also, for instance, a mechanism for spin, by virtue of spin-
ning motion of each pole. The poles are also liable to divide in even smaller units –
plausibly at high energies, such as that of a free p- pole, in conforming to experimental
evidence for the existence of quarks. ”Finer structures” as such involve sub-levels of
energy and structure of a basic material particle than to be focused here.

The remaining physics of this paper will be the direct corollaries of Prop. 1, or
after supplemented with further experimental evidence, or Newtonian solutions based
on these.

a. The interaction between the bare-charges

From Prop. 1.2 combined with Coulomb’s law, it directly follows:

Corollary 1.
bare-charge pair are attracted via the Coulomb potential:

The bound negative- and positive- bare-charge pair in a neutral

where ra is the intra-bare-charge pair distance. See FIG. 1.

Regarding Ua = 983 MeV (the energy contained in a proton mass, see Prop. 2 and
10−18 m. The exact value of
Secs. IV E-IV K), then (5) gives ra = e2/4πǫ0Ua ≈
Ua or ra is not of concern in this paper. Vacuum dynamic properties involved (Sec.
IV C) can be evaluated from the light velocity, in analogy to the use of sound velocity
in lattice dynamics.

·

b. Vacuum in response to an external perturbation

From Prop. 1.1, and Prop. 1.2 and Cor. 1, it follows (1) and (2) below:

Corollary 2.
(1) If no polarisation ﬁeld presents, the neutral bare-charge pairs will
present as a ﬂuid of perfect ﬂuidity. (2) A suﬃciently high polarisation ﬁeld will turn
the surrounding vacuum into elastic bare-charge pair-chains radiating outwards from
the source, each composed of coupled bare-charge pair-oscillators owing to dipole-dipole
attractions.
Since ra (

10−18m) is by a factor 10−8 lesser than any intra-atomic spacing (

∼
10−10 m), the Ua by (3 ) is thus by an inverse factor, 108, greater than the intra-
particle potential of the latter. Hence a correspondingly high ﬁeld may be expected
to polarise a neutral bare-charge pair. See further after Cor. 4.

∼

A high elasticity is anticipated, from the exceedingly small inter-bare-charge pair
distance, b, of the scale
ra, which will yield a high dipole-
dipole attraction among the polarised bare-charge pairs along an bare-charge pair-
chain.

10−18 m if putting b

≈

∼

The applied polarisation ﬁeld will produce in each bare-charge pair-chain a shear
elasticity but not longitudinal, since the bare-charge pairs, although polarised, are by
virtue of Prop. 1.1 perfectly compressible. Consequently, the polarised bare-charge
pair-chain can only transmit transverse displacements but not longitudinal, because
the latter operate by virtue of alternations of stretching and compression. The bare-
charge pair-chain is seen to be analogues to a ﬂexible material string, such as one of
violin: Its metal string itself possesses no rigidity but will acquire one upon stretching,
by which it will transmit transverse but not longitudinal waves.

Given the polarised vacuum has a shear elasticity, and assuming for it Newtonian

mechanics applies, we therefore expect
Corollary 3. The transverse disturbance of an applied ﬁeld will be propagated
through the apparently elastic bare-charge pair-chains of vacuum, in the form of me-
chanical waves.

c. The origin of electromagnetic waves

From Cor. 3, supplemented with the observational fact that in vacuum there prop-
agate no other waves than the (transverse) electromagnetic waves, which do originate
from certain oscillating electric charge (or magnetic dipole), it hence follows:
Corollary 4. The mechanical waves depicted by Cor. 3 identiﬁes with the obser-
vational electromagnetic waves; the wave velocity in vacuum equals the light velocity
c = 3

108 m/sec.

·

∼

Cor. 4 in turn supplements Cor. 2(2) as follows: (A) Given light velocity in
vacuum is higher by a factor 105 than velocities of all known mechanical waves (raging
200
5000 m/s), the vacuum has plausibly an exceedingly high elasticity, agreeing
with the indication by the small b earlier. (B) For the b estimated (after Cor. 2),
the frequency upper limit at which the electromagnetic waves can be propagated in
1026 1/sec. = 1240 GeV. In comparison,
vacuum is

observed limit.

d. Vacuum in the absence of external perturbation

Owing to the vacuum property of Prop. 1.1 and its possessing an elasticity that
is only created by external-ﬁeld, the bare-charge pair oscillators in an bare-charge
pair-chain only will respond to a disturbance and pass it then to adjacent bare-charge
pairs. If no subsequent disturbance follows, it will restore at once to equilibrium. The
above feature implies:
Corollary 5.
(1) The vacuum medium comprising neutral bare-charge pairs has
only one single degenerate state, called here the vacuum level (FIG. 1). (2) No
thermal disordering can be introduced and stored in the vacuum medium, any wave
disturbance will propagate only transiently passing through it and without damping
and (3) the vacuum medium has therefore a zero entropy and a zero temperature.
Since Cor. 5 (2)-(3) merely recapitulates the observational property of vacuum,
that ”the bare-charge pairs are completely at rest” stated in Prop. 1.1 is hence a
submicroscopic representation of the observational property of vacuum.

In Secs. IV B-IV C, Cor. 3 will be formally derived in terms of Newtonian so-
lution for the vacuum medium structured by Prop. 1; Cors. 4-5 will be formally
represented in terms of the solution.

e. Disintegration of a neutral bare-charge pair in the vacuum medium

From Prop. 1 .2 and .4 and Coulomb’s law it directly follows (1) and, by combining

with Cor. 5 it further follows (2) of Cor. 6 below:
Corollary 6.
(1) A single negative bare-charge newly created in vacuum will be
repelled by the negative bare-charge envelopes of the surrounding bare-charge pairs, of
a potential barrier Un(> 0) (FIG. 1). To create for itself a site therein, a free negative
bare-charge must have a minimum kinetic energy E−1 = Un. (2) Between the E−1
and Ua there is no intermediate energy level for the negative bare-charge to decay to.
Suppose a free negative bare-charge and a positive bare-charge represent an electron
and a positron (to justify in Sec. IV), and are being annihilated, and are of zero linear

momenta both before and after: Pv .−1 = Pv .+1 = 0 and Pv

the annihilation two gammas are emitted, of a total momentum P † + P ‡; momentum

conservation requires: Pv.−1+Pv .+1 = Pv
.−1+Pv
But E−1 = P †c and E+1 = P ‡c for the positive bare-charge (Sec. IV G). The last
two equations give: E+1 = E−1. From Prop. 1.4 and the above it follows:
Corollary 7. A positive bare-charge, created together with an negative bare-charge

f. Prediction of material particles: an outline beforehand and the supplemental
experimental evidence

Based on Prop. 1 and Cors. 1-7, in terms of Newtonian solution for vacuum
subjected to an bare-charge perturbation, we will in Secs. IV B-VII formally predict:

Proposition 2. (The Prediction)

2.1. A free negative bare-charge depicted by Prop. 1 having a kinetic
energy Eq = E−1 relative to the vacuum level together with the wave
disturbances it generates in the medium corresponds to a localised electron
10−31 kg; a virtually free positive bare-charge
of a rest-mass Me = 9.109
with an identical property (with E+1 = E−1 relative to Up) except with
a positive charge, corresponds to a localised positron (Dirac, 1928, 1933,
Anderson 1932) of a virtual mass equal to Me.

×

2.2. 2E−1 corresponds to the energy released from the annihilation of a
stationary electron and position into a neutral bare-charge pair; E−1 = 511
keV as from pair annihilation/production experiments.

2.3. A free positive bare-charge of a kinetic energy E+2 =

Up =
938.3 MeV above the vacuum level, together with the wave disturbances it
generates, corresponds to a proton.

−

The vacuum structure (Prop. 1, Cor. 7) together with the positron construction
(Prop. 2.1) complies to the experimental observation that positrons do not exist as
free particles. The negatively-charged envelopes of the neutral bare-charge pairs are
seen to facilitate a ”negative ﬁeld” which traps the positrons, as conjectured by Dirac
(1928) in his theoretical discovery of ”positron”.

The vacuum property by Cor. 7 and Prop. 1.2 -1.4, explains why the annihila-
tion of an ”existing” electron with a (yet ”non-existing”) positron, takes place most
probably within a material substance. Clearly, the positive charge(s) of the protons
in the substance will supply a positive potential ﬁeld to push a hidden positron out
from the negative potential well.

Similarly, the disintegration of a pair of bound bare-charges into an electron and a
positron requires by Cors. 1, 6-7 an energy supply
+ 2Eq (FIG. 1). This huge
energy, mainly required to drag an bare-charge out of its Ua -well, can be supplied
if a free charge, e.g. a ”free” positive bare-charge presents nearby. This agrees with
the experimental observation that pair production occurs always in the presence of a
nucleus.

Ua|

≥ |

The formation of a proton (Prop. 2.3) requires an energy far greater than that
of a positron (Prop. 2.1) and greater than any energy in natural supply on earth
except for certain nuclear processes.

Let the particles having a non-zero rest-mass be called material particles. The
vacuum structure (Props. 1 and its Corollaries) and the material particles formed
from it (Prop. 2) imply:

9

Corollary 8. If vacuum is the exclusive source of production, and also the desti-
nation of annihilation of electric charges and thereby the material particles, then the
creation of a material particle and its anti-particle would always occur simultaneously.
For examples, an electron and a positron, a proton and an anti-proton, etc. So there
would always present in our world equal numbers of material particles and their anti-
particles (free or virtue).

The substantial nature of vacuum (Prop. 1 and its corollaries) implies:

Corollary 9. Vacuum facilitates, or it manifests as, an absolute space, a space that
is not ”translatable” and remains to itself.

In this paper all particle motions we deal with will be assumed to be relative to
this absolute space residing in a reference frame S, or relative to a reference frame
S′ moving only slowly relative to S such that no meaningful deviation from Galilean
transformation is introduced.

IV. THE FORMATION OF A BASIC MATERIAL PARTICLE FROM A
FREE BARE-CHARGE IN VACUUM GIVEN BY NEWTONIAN
SOLUTION

A. Deﬁnition of basic material particles

→

The particles which constitute a material substance (at zero Kelvin), as we know,
have a non-zero rest-mass, and are thus the material particles deﬁned earlier (see after
Prop. 2, before Cor. 8). Nuclei and electrons are known to be the basic particles
that constitute at the subatomic level the materials. A nucleus is in turn composed of
neutrons (n’s) and protons (p’s). Of the two species, according to beta-decay process
p+ + e− + ν, a neutron n is composed of a proton p+ and an electron e− which
n
are material particles; the ν has a zero rest-mass and is thus not of concern here.
Altogether, for the purpose of building a material substance, we have the electron
and the proton as the basic constituent particles; these are hence the basic material
particles. We below in Secs. IV B-IV M, V-VII illustrate the formation of the two
kinds of basic material particles (electron and proton), as given by Newtonian solution
of equations of motion of the bare-charge pairs under the perturbation of a free bare-
charge.

There exist also another type of energy entities above the vacuum level, e.g. the
”photons” and ”phonons”, which have a zero rest-mass; Sec. VIII will illustrate
that these are attributable to mechanical disturbances in a medium, (permanently)
detached from their charges.

B. Wave function solution for the forced oscillation of the coupled bare-charge
pairs in vacuum and the resultant electromagnetic wavetrains

Consider that a free bare-charge as deﬁned by Prop. 1 and Cors. 6-7, is in trans-
lational motion in X direction in vacuum, at a low velocity v so as to be essentially
standing still with respect to its oscillations say in Y direction. The bare-charge
and its surrounding vacuum, as with any object, is in our physical world normally
surrounded by other material substances, particles in single or condensed forms and
nearer or farther that function as an enclosure. Hence we can model this reality, in

10

the simplest form as that the bare-charge together with its immediate surrounding
vacuum is enclosed in an (eﬀectively) one-dimensional box of side L. (See Sec. IV E
about three-dimensional case.)

Owing to its kinetic energy Eq the bare-charge tends to displace away from its
equilibrium say at Xs, ψq(T ) apart at time T in Y direction. As being resisted by the
polarised bare-charge pairs, the bare-charge has a ﬁnite mobility; we represent this
”viscous force” by an inertial mass,
Mq. Owing to the bare-charge’s charge, on the
other hand, the bare-charge pairs in the surrounding will be polarised into dipoles
being attracted one another, forming a (linear) bare-charge pair-chain along the X
axis of say Nb:L coupled bare-charge pair oscillators, each of an inertial mass
Mb
similarly owing to a viscosity against its motion, of a force constant κ on shearing.
The bare-charge pair-chain, through the s-th bare-charge pair at Xs, exerts in turn an
attraction force Fqa that tends to resist the bare-charge’s motion. Supposing the bare-
charge pair-chain has an eﬀective total length Nb:Lψ (see Eq. 27), it thus has a total
Mq.
mass Nb:LψMb; for Nb:Lψ being large and given
One thus expects the s-th bare-charge pair’s displacement, ψs, to be << ψq.
So during each one-way oscillation the bare-charge uses only a (small) portion of
its total mechanical energy contained in ψq to exert an eﬀective driving force, Faq(T ),
th bare-charge pair in ”contact” and drives it into a displacement

Associated with ψq

∗(T ) is also a sinusoidal charge oscillation; this would according
to Maxwell’s electromagnetism generate a ”detached” transverse electric ﬁeld Et(T)
and magnetic ﬁeld Ht(T ). The ”detachment” here is however only temporary; since
the ”detached” ﬁelds will be reﬂected back from the box walls, and be re-absorbed by
the bare-charge, referred to as refuel scheme. The refuel will repeat indeﬁnitely for
an negative bare-charge at the zero-velocity level (FIG. 1), as it has nowhere to decay
to except for annihilation (Cor. 6.2). The kinetic modes of a travelling negative
bare-charge will also not damp if assuming a vacuum medium and non-absorbing
walls. The Et(T) and the corresponding static radial electric ﬁeld, Er = e/4πǫor (here
r = X), of the bare-charge charge, are known from classical electromagnetism to be
related by Et = Ω2ψq(T)XEr/c2. We will below alternatively, but equivalently as by

The mechanical waves given by (11)-(12) identify, as argued for Cor. 4, with the
electromagnetic waves, attached here to the bare-charge. The wave velocity c hence
equals light velocity.

Consider a free bare-charge in the general case of Sec. IV B travelling at a velocity
v (<< c), here ﬁrstly in the +X direction. Let the S′ frame be attached to the bare-
charge (at X ′ = 0); let X = X ′ = 0 at T = 0. Due to its motion, the bare-charge in
each period Γ surpasses the electromagnetic waves ψ† and ψ‡, generated to the right
(v
vΓ respectively. Hence the intrinsic
wavelengths Λ’s are shortened and elongated by vΓ , to the ﬁnal ones:

will become clear, the intrinsic quantities K, etc., are variables that will yield the
classical results of Newtonian solutions. Accordingly (v/c)2
0 will be called the
classical velocity limit. Any eﬀect on the property of a moving particle that results
from terms linear in v/c, will be called a ﬁrst kind source motion (FSM) eﬀect,
or FSME. We have thereby got:

We start here by considering a more general case where the wave disturbances an
bare-charge generates propagate into a solid angle, σ, or a ”cone-chain” of bare-charge

Mb ≃ Mq and Ω = Ωq, we then recover Eq. (4), i.e., A

≃
Aq/Nb:Lψ . For Nb:Lψ being large, we have A << Aq. That is, the bare-charge losses
in each oscillation cycle Γ only one part in Nb:Lψ of its total energy, so will oscillate
continuously over a substantial time Tq, and generate continuously a wavetrain of
NΛ-wavelengths. This is analogous to a ping-pong ball in a box: if initially knocked
J
hard against one of the hard walls, it will bounce back and forth many cycles before
losing its entire mechanical energy.

G. Dynamics of the rectilinear motion of the electromagnetic wavetrain

Each polarised electromagnetic wavetrain, travelling at a ﬁnite velocity c and hav-
ing a translational kinetic energy E† or E‡, is an inertial system and hence has by
Newton’s ﬁrst law a linear momentum

P † = M †c

(a),

or P ‡ = M ‡c

(b);

√P †P ‡ = √M †M ‡c

(c)

(29)

and an inertial mass M † or M ‡ and √M †M ‡ as deﬁned above. Similar to Eqs. (20),
we have for the classical velocity limit the intrinsic linear momentum and inertial
mass of the total electromagnetic wavetrain:

P = lim

(v/c)2→0

√P †P ‡

(a)

and

M = lim

(v/c)2→0

√M †M ‡

(b)

(30)

Substituting (30a)-(30b) into (29c) gives:

P = M c.

16

(31)

Now E† and P †, and similarly E‡ and P ‡, are well-known from classical electromag-
netism to be related by (Ref. [b]): E† = P †c, and E‡ = P ‡. The two equations give:
√E†E‡ = √P †P ‡c; using (25) and (30a) in it gives the (a), and using further (31)
gives the (b) below

E = P c

(a)

E = M c2

(b)

(25)′ and (32b) yield M expressed by the intrinsic wave parameters:

M = h∗

Notice that, despite their resemblance to Planck-Schr¨odinger’s expressions for an elec-
tromagnetic wave quantum, Eqs. (31)-(33) have resulted entirely as the Newtonian
solution for vacuum under an bare-charge perturbation.

H. Formation of a basic material particle and its intrinsic classical variables

The P and M of (30a)-(30b) are in the classic velocity limit (v/c)2

0 exact for a
wave generated by a moving bare-charge of velocity v. Meanwhile, as Eq. (28) states,
the energy of the (electromagnetic) wavetrain equals the energy of the total system
of the bare-charge and wavetrain. Therefor, in the given velocity limit, the P and M
are exact quantities of the total system.

→

Furthermore, the inertial mass M of a given system is according to Newtonian
mechanics a generic property of that system, applying to any motion of it. Hence, it
follows for our particular concern here:

Corollary 11. The total system of the bare-charge and wavetrain, when in motion
0, will manifest an inertial mass equal to the M

at a velocity v satisfying (v/c)2
as deﬁned by Eq. (31).

→

For instance when impressed by a force F , by Newton’s second law the total system
will respond with an inertial force M (dv/dT ) = F . In time ∆T this F will accelerate
the total system into a velocity v, a linear momentum and a translational kinetic
energy:

If F is the earth’s gravitational force, F = M g, or weight, M represents then a
gravitational mass.

Clearly, the total system of the bare-charge and wavetrain as a whole has thus far
shown to possess the basic observational properties of a (semi-)classical material par-
ticle: It has a charge, a mass (at rest or in slow motion), and a mass manifested as
weight in gravitational ﬁeld; when in slow motion it obeys the Newtonian dynamic re-
lations (34)-(35); it is generically a wave. The Newtonian solution for this total system
predicts furthermore the origin of its size, and several basic classical or semi-classical

17

relations, which we discuss in Secs. IV I-IV M. It therefore suﬃces to conclude that,
in the classical/semi-classical context:
Corollary 12. The total system of a free bare-charge together with the electro-
magnetic wavetrain it generates, gives rise to a basic material particle, having a
charge of that of the bare-charge, q, an intrinsic energy E = Eq, momentum P and
an inertial mass M = E/c2 (Eq. 32b), and being generically a wave of the intrin-
sic wave parameters K, Λ,
e, E(= E−1) = 511 keV and thus

I. Further on the origin of inertial mass of particles

From the physical scheme leading to the deﬁnition of inertial mass, Eqs.

(31),

(32b), and (33), it follows for a single material particle in vacuum:
Corollary 13. (1) The (rest) inertial mass M of a material particle is a consequence
that the vacuum medium, being highly elastic when polarised, impresses a ﬁnite viscous
resistance against the (localised) oscillatory motion of its bare-charge (a bare charge);
or alternately, as by Eq. (28) a ﬁnite viscous resistance against the propagation of
its constituent electromagnetic waves. (2) M hence manifests along the direction of
(source) motion.

The viscous resistance of the vacuum against the bare-charge’s motion is conserva-
tive within the total system of the bare-charge + vacuum medium, as a result of Cor.
5 and the bare-charge’s refuel scheme (Sec. IV D). Therefore the M is a constant of
the total system.

Evidently, inertial mass can manifest in analogous systems by a similar mechanism.
Below are some typical ones: (1). A localised free bare-charge in a material medium at
zero Kelvin. It hence has an inertial mass as above except for being augmented by the
material’s dielectric constant ǫr(> 1). (2). A free bare-charge of a thermal velocity
v in a material medium of ﬁnite temperature in equilibrium. It thus has an inertial
mass as of (1) except being augmented by its v (see Paper II). (3). A electromagnetic
wavetrain detached from its source, with a inertial mass as above but belonging only
to the detached wave.

J. The origin of the size of particles

Given the scheme of particle formation as outlined by Cor. 12, it follows:

Corollary 14. A (material) particle extends by virtue of its constituent electromag-
netic wavetrains, and the therein-stored energy and mass, throughout the enclosure
in which the wavetrains propagate. This is for example along the box side L in a
one-dimensional box (Secs. V-VI), or along the circular orbit L for the electron in a
hydrogen-like atom (Secs. VII). Anywhere in this enclosure one can detect a portion
of the wavetrain, or of the intrinsic energy and momentum, or of the mass of the
particle. L is an intrinsic spatial component of the particle and hence represents the
size of the particle, denoted by D:

(36)

D = L.

18

K. The intrinsic energy and inertial mass equivalence relation

From the Newtonian dynamic solution of Sec. IV G and Cor. 13, it follows:

Corollary 15. The oscillatory energy of a free bare charge, Eq which equals E, and
the inertial mass of the resultant particle, M , are two co-existing properties of the
particle, and are quantitatively equivalent through the Newtonian work-energy relation,
Eq. (32b).

The notion of energy-mass equivalence, Cor. 15, was contemplated by I. Newton
already in his Opticks in 1730, and was ﬁrst postulated on a phenomenological ground
by Einstein (1905) in a relativistic form which we will infer from Newtonian solution
in Paper II. The electron-positron pair processes, for example are basic evidence for
it.

L. Semi-empirical expression for Planck constant

Experimentally each gamma ray released after the annihilation (1) has an energy
, h being Planck constant. By Cor. 12, an electron and a positron formed

Epa = h
in the general scheme has an intrinsic energy E of (32) or (32b)′. Hence, Epa = E(
E−1). Using (32b)′ and the Epa given above in the identity yields:

≡

V

h = h∗

or :

h = (1/2)(2π)2

NΛρA2c.

(37)

J

(37) gives a semi-empirical expression for Planck constant in terms of the intrinsic
wave parameters in vacuum. If h is taken for granted a constant, hence the right-hand
side term of (37) is a constant. But since ρ and c are constants of the vacuum, hence
NΛΛ for a given Λ) and A are the only two variables in (37), and

NΛ (or Lψ =

J
LψA2 = Constant.

M. Semi-empirical expressions de Broglie parameters

V. THE FORMATION OF A TRAVELLING NEWTON-DE BROGLIE
(NdB) WAVE FROM NEWTONIAN SOLUTION: ILLUSTRATED FOR A
ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOX

We illustrate in this section how a Newton-de Broglie (NdB) wave is formed in a
one-dimensional box of zero ﬁeld, which is straightforwardly extendible to a uniform
ﬁeld, and in Sec. VI its eigen solutions when the box is small. The extension to a
three-dimensional box is straightforward. In Sec. VII we show that the NdB particle
wave formation scheme is generally applicable in a centripetal ﬁeld.

Consider the bare-charge as of Sec. IV, in a one-dimensional box of side L, ﬁrstly
travels to the right. The K † and K ‡ are given by Eq. (19); in the moving frame S′,
Ω†′ = Ω and K ′ = K; with these in Eq. (11), the two polarised waves generated by
the bare-charge as measured in S′ write:

ψ†

K † (X ′, T ) = A sin[(K + Kd)X ′
ψ‡

K ‡ (X ′, T ) =

A sin[(K

−

−

−

ΩT + α0 + α′]

Kd)X ′ + ΩT + α0]

(a)
(b)

(11)′

The wave front generated to the bare-charge’s right at X1 at time T1, ψ†(X1, T1), will
travel ﬁrstly to the right, and after a round-trip of distance 2L, return to X1 at time
T + ∆T becoming ψ†(X1 + 2L, T1 + ∆T ). Here it acquires due to the 2L an extra
phase αX = K2L, and also a phase shift 2αr = 2π due to reﬂections at the left and
right (massive) walls. And here it will meet with a ψ‡(X1, T1 + ∆T ) generated to the
bare-charge’s left at time T + ∆T . A complete constructive interference of the waves
requires

K2L = N 2π.

(41)

Hence α′ = αX + 2αr = N 2π + 2π. In addition to (41), the mechanical requirement
at a massive wall, the (42a) below, leads further to the condition (42b) below:

ψd(0, T ) = ψd(L, T ) = 0 (a);

α0 = N02π, N0 = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(b).

(42)

If L is ﬁxed but

, K are apt to vary, then (41) is fulﬁlled by restricting K to:

V

KN = N π/L,

N = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

(41)′

(41) and (42b) yield the total wave amplitude, ψd = ψ† + ψ‡, to be a maximum:

ψd(X ′, T )= 2A cos(KX ′) sin(KdX ′

ΩT ) = ψdKψdKd

−
ψd has a total length as of (12)′: Lψd =

the two oppositely-travelling waves ψ† and ψ‡ (solid and dotted curves, left graph).
In (43), the wave component ψdK = 2A cos(KX ′) yield in total wave amplitude a
rapid oscillation at each intrinsic wavelength Λ = 2π/K. The component ψdKd =
sin(KdX ′
ΩT ) modulates the ψd into an envelope function (dotted curve, right
graph) around the ψdK. The envelope, or the beat, travels at a phase velocity

(48)-(49) are readily seen to be the de Broglie relations, if h∗ = h as by (26).

The Newtonian solutions, (18), (45)-(47), and (48)-(49) have resulted to be identical
to the empirically expressed de Broglie wave parameters of (40) b, a, c, d, and the
empirical de Broglie relations (39a)-(39b). From this immediate equivalence and the
equivalence in other key aspects to be justiﬁed in the following sections, it follows:
Corollary 16.
(1). As a result of the FSME, a (basic) material particle wave
formed according to Cor. 12 travelling at velocity v is modulated to have a new
wavelength, Λd of Eq. (45), in addition to its Λ. The particle’s wave and dynamic
property associated with Λd is equivalent to that of the empirically known de Broglie
particle wave; the particle will be called a Newton-de Broglie (NdB) particle wave.
The Λd identiﬁes accordingly with the so-called de Broglie wavelength. (2). In inverse
proportion to Λd is a spilt by Kd in the K. Kd is by Eq. (18) in direct proportion
to v, and inverse proportion to the distance Λd between consecutive beats. This is the
mechanism that the Λd, is inversely proportional to v. (3) The NdB wave travels at a
phase velocity V , Eq. (44), by a factor c/v and (c/v)2 greater than the light velocity
c and the particle velocity v.

Corollaries 12 and 16 together complete our prediction of Prop. 2, in terms of

particle properties as are known in classical and quantum mechanics.

VI. THE NEWTONIAN QUNATIZED-STATE SOLUTION FOR A
STANDING NDB WAVE IN A SMALL ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOX; ITS
EQUIVALENCE TO SCHR ¨ODINGER’S SOLUTION

The bare-charge of Sec. V, travelling to the right and generating ψd, will after
d. The ψd or ψ∗

time Γ d/2 be reﬂected and travel to the left and generate a wave, ψ∗

21

will loop continuously between the walls. They are thus as if being generated by two
simultaneous bare-charges, one real and the other imaginary, travelling in opposite
directions. The ψd and ψ∗
d will interfere mutually; this is a simultaneous process with
that of Sec. V, but the consequence to the dynamic variables, for L not signiﬁcantly
greater than Λd, will be distinct, chieﬂy the state quantisation.

a. Wavefunction solution.

Owing to the relative phase of their waves to
be speciﬁed below, the real bare-charge will always be L ahead of the imaginary.
The ψd(X1, T1) generated at (X1, T1), after travelling a 2L in time ∆T , becoming
ψd(X1 + 2L, T1 + ∆T ), will meet a ψ∗
d(X1, T1 + ∆T ) just generated by the imaginary
bare-charge. ψd(X1 + 2L, T1 + ∆T ) may be got from Eq. (43), after including two
changes: (a) an extra phase αX = K2L = 2π in the travelling ψdKd; (b) a phase
shift 2βr = 2π at the right and left (massive) walls. That is, ψd(X + 2L, T + ∆T ) =
cos(KX ′) sin[KdX ′
(43)
after including three changes: (c) travelling direction reversal resultant (i) a left-right
ΩT ; (d) a phase change βsr = π of

size, mass, etc.
It will not be meaningful to speak of at which point in space the
particle is located. Rather, one can speak of with how large a probability the particle
can be found at that point. Then it is equivalent to determining how large portion an
energy is contained (in the particle’s NdB wave in an inﬁnitesimal volume element)
2, similar as illustrated for ψ in
at that point. The particle’s intrinsic energy is

certainty across L originates evidently from the distributive nature of a NdB particle,
as represented in Para. VIc by a probability. The uncertainty across ∆Pv indicates
a ﬁnite interval in momentum space, which is inaccessible to the microscopic state of
the particle. Or, it pertains to a gap for the given particle system, just as predicted
by Schr¨odinger’s solution.

e. Compare with the solution of Schr¨odinger’s quantum mechanics. The
Newtonian solution for vacuum subjected to an bare-charge perturbation, and the sub-
sequent NdB particle solution from wave superposition in a box, is equivalent to the fa-
(¯h2/2M)(∂2/∂X 2)ψSc(X) =
miliar Schr¨odinger’s equation of quantum mechanics:
EψSc(X) for an identical system. The constructive inference and the initial-time
conditions, (51) and (42b), are together equivalent to the boundary condition of
Schr¨odinger’s which is literally the (42a). The Newtonian solutions (52), (56), (51),
(55a)-(55b), etc. are in complete agreement with Schr¨odinger’s wavefunction solution

ψSc(X) = C sin(KdnX)

and its corresponding probability, Kdn, and Ev n and Pv n, etc.

ψSc(X) for the energy levels n = 1, 2, 3 are shown by the dotted lines in FIG. 4. The
ﬁne structure in ψK of (53) as contrasted to the constant C of ψSc(X) pertains not to a
true diﬀerence if we agree the following: The present Newtonian solution supplements
the (de Broglie) particle wave with the submicroscopic content that is not touched
by Schr¨odinger’s scheme which is formal and vigorous but is phenomenological in its
theoretical grounding. For similar reason, the L
, Eq. (12), is in the present scheme
one important parameter for describing a (particle) wave, particularly its interference
etc., but not in Schr¨odinger’s scheme.

that a basic material particle is generically an electromagnetic wave (wrapped around
a tiny bare-charge seated with a charge). It will however show as if being a point
particle in real space, by virtue of Para. VIc when L is small, or by the de Broglie
relations (48)-(49), or if its charge is being probed. A compound particle can be
discussed similarly, except that more than one bare-charges are involved.

i. The equivalence of Newtonian mechanics and Schr¨odinger’s quan-
tum mechanics. The above generic properties of a NdB particle in motion (with
(v/c)2
0) are seen to identity with all of the properties as given by the solution
of Schr¨odinger’s quantum mechanics. Schr¨odinger’s quantum mechanics applied to a
particle, identiﬁes therefore with Newtonian mechanics as applied to the motion of
the submicroscopic components, the bare-charge pair-oscillators and the bare-charge,
which comprise the particle. Therefore, through the development of the general
scheme for the submicroscopic formation of material particles, we have completed
one basic task of the uniﬁcation of Newtonian and quantum mechanics.

VII. ELECTRON IN A HYDROGEN-LIKE ATOM

Consider an negative bare-charge of charge -e, yielding an electron, circulates in
an orbit of radius R, circumference L = 2πR, at the velocity u about its nucleus of
charge +Ze at rest. The polarised wavefunction solution (11)′ remains to apply for
the electron here in a circular coordinate ℓ, oriented clockwise along the L: ψ(ℓ, T ). (A
radial wave will result predominately from the nucleus, and can be treated similarly
as by the Schr¨odinger’s mathematical formalism.) The ψ†(ℓ, T ) generated at T ahead
of the bare-charge, after travelling clockwise an extra distance L in time ∆T , will gain
an extra phase α′ = αℓ = LK and become ψ†(ℓ + L, T + ∆T ) = A sin[K †ℓ
ΩT + αℓ].
Here it meets with the wave ψ‡(ℓ, T + ∆T ) =
sin[K ‡ℓ + ΩT ] generated at T + ∆T
behind the bare-charge; the minus sign is given by αRL = π; we have put α0 = N02π.
If now αℓ = KL = N 2π, i.e. K = N 2π/L, N = 0, 1, . . . , then ψ† and ψ‡ superpose

The Newtonian solution, Eqs. (63)-(64), agrees completely with Schr¨odinger’s solu-
tion for an identical system; so will the corresponding angular momentum.

Ln = 2πRn is the orbit of the outermost electron (a basic particle); its diameter
Dn = 2Rn deﬁnes the linear size of the compound particle, the hydrogen-like atom
here, agreeing with Cor. 14. Observe further that the orbiting electron constantly
radiates electromagnetic waves according to Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, both
owing to its bare-charge’s intrinsic oscillation, and to the radial acceleration in the
nucleus ﬁeld. This long-regarded conﬂict of quantum mechanics with Maxwell’s elec-
tromagnetic theory naturally vanishes here.

For systems of complex potential ﬁelds, an explicit NdB wave construction via su-
perposition will become too tedious if not impossible. These systems can be instead
treated in a uniﬁed framework with Newtonian solutions, using the existing formal-
ism of solving Schr¨odinger’s wave equation, if the equation has been derived from
Newtonian solutions. We will present the derivation in a separate paper.

VIII. THE NATURE OF ”PHOTON”; EXCITATION RELATED
PROCESSES

a. Gamma rays from pair annihilation. If viewing the formation of an electron
and a positron, each at rest, as by Cor. 12 in a reversed order, we then get that
the particles’ total constituent electromagnetic wave trains are detached from their
bare-charges, which are just the observational gamma rays. The detached wave train
(alone) continues to have an intrinsic frequency
of (13), a wavefunction and total
length as of (11) and (12) reexpressed below with a subscript ph:

If the enclosure size L is altered,
would alter but not Lψ if assuming no energy ex-

kinetic energy, linear momentum, and eﬀective mass:

An electromagnetic wave (train) from a pair annihilation as above or from the
thermal radiation below, is customarily called a ”photon” which is literally meant to
be a ”point particle” in real space. For familiarity we will call our detached wave trains
”photons”. Nevertheless, as the Newtonian solutions, e.g. (65) in the above, expresses,
the wavetrain ψph is distributed across a length Lψph in real space. The distributive
photon description conforms to all experimental exhibitions of electromagnetic waves
involving superposition, like diﬀraction and interference, which all generally take place
over a ﬁnite (i.e. non-zero) length. The distributive wave train also fulﬁls the de
Broglie relations (48)-(49) just as a classical ”point” particle does, agreeing with
the experimental exhibitions of electromagnetic waves when interacting with conﬁned
systems (e.g. in black body radiation), or at high energies (e.g. Compton scattering).
In the latter sense, a detached electromagnetic wave train is apparently also a NdB
particle although without an bare-charge. The distributive ”photon” description here
is analogous to Schr¨odinger’s description of distributive ”phonons” which are the
momentum-space quanta of sound waves that are distributive in real space, and which
are mechanical disturbances propagated through the coupled (atomic etc.) oscillators
in a material medium for which one has the atomic model in one’s possession.

b. Electromagnetic radiation from thermal de-excitation and its related.
(A) Consider for simplicity that in an identical (basic) particle assembly, a reference
particle at rest is collided by another particle into a velocity vn. By Cor. 16(2),
the kinetic energy gain will manifest at the submicroscopic level as the addition of a
thermal mode
Kd of Eq. (18), or Kdn of Eq. (51), onto the intrinsic mode K of
the particle’s constitiuent electromagnetic waves. And this Kd mode modulates the
standing wavetrain amplitude, Eq. (52), by an orthogonal factor sin(KdnX) across
Lψ; and similarly with the travelling NdB wave of (43). This is the mechanism of
thermal excitation via collision. A velocity change from vn to vn+1 can be similarly
discussed. (B) If the particle is now (abruptly) decelerated from vn to 0, the extra
wave disturbance
ψd(Kd) of length Lψ will be released, which is a reverse process of
(A). Stating the mechanism for (A) in reverse order we thus have the mechanism for
the thermal de-excitation via electromagnetic radiation. (C) If after (B) the parti-
ψd(Kd), mechanically this extra wave then
cle (re)absorbs the electromagnetic wave
drives the bare-charge into an additional oscillation of
Vd; which by Eq. (18) read in
e
reverse order will increase the particle velocity from 0 to vn. This gives the mechanism
of a thermal excitation via electromagnetic absorption. (D) If the extra electromag-
netic wave in the above is replaced by a sound wave and the vacuum replaced by a
material medium, then (A)-(C) describe the heat radiations or absorptions.

a A substantial entity refers here to a certain physical existence which contains certain form
of energy.

b Consider the polarised electromagnetic wave ψ†, of ﬁelds E, B along Y, Z, passes a charge
e ﬁxed along X but free to move along Y, Z. The force Fe from E drives the charge into a
velocity v along −Y . So during time ∆T , Fe does a work We = Fe∆T v to the charge; and
B exerts on it an impulse P † = Fm∆T = We/c. But only E does work, so the total work is
W = We; but W = E†. It follows from the above: P † = E†/c.

of the surrounding neutral bare-charge pairs comprising vacuum. Eq = Un is the minimum

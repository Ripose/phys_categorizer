Abstract

A sequence of integers generated by the number of conjugated pairs of homaloidal nets of plane algebraic curves of even
order is found to provide an exact integer-valued match for El Naschie’s primordial set of fractal dimensions characterizing
transﬁnite heterotic string space-time.

1. Introduction

Recently [1], employing the algebra and arithmetic of self-conjugate homaloidal nets of pla-
nar algebraic curves, we have discovered a couple of integer-valued progressions that are found
to mimic extraordinary well the two El Naschie sequences of fractal dimensions characterizing
transﬁnite heterotic string space-time. One of the progressions is demonstrated to provide an
algebraic geometrical justiﬁcation not only for all the relevant dimensions of the classical theory,
but also for other two dimensions advocated by El Naschie [2–5], namely the smallest value of the
inverse of non-supersymmetric quantum gravity coupling constant, ¯αg = 42 + 2k
42.36067977,
≃
68.54101967. A non-trivial
and the inverse of ﬁne structure constant, ¯α0 = 2
coupling between the two El Naschie sequences has also been revealed.

2. Conjugate pairs of homaloidal nets and primordial El Naschie’s dimensions

In the present paper, we put forward another ‘homaloidal’ sequence that oﬀers a nice ﬁt to
the primordial set of fractal dimensions introduced by El Naschie, i.e. to the set deﬁned by [2–5]

Dq = [136 + 6φ3

φ2 =
where q is a non-negative integer and φ is taken to be identical with the golden mean, φ = 1
(cid:16)√5
0.618033989. The new sequence is borne by the numbers of conjugate pairs of
homaloidal nets of a given order n, #pair
(see [1,6,7] for the deﬁnitions, symbols and notation).
From the properties of plane Cremona transfomations [6–8] it is obvious that these numbers are
given by the following simple formula

with #tot

those nets that are self-conjugate. As in the preceding paper [1], our homaloidal numerology relies
almost exclusively on the ‘data’ found in an old, but very important, paper by B. Mlodziejowski

these are given in column three of the table. We see that this sequence is an exact integer-valued
ﬁt of the El Naschie sequence (introduced in an explicit form in the last column of the table);
and its corresponding fractal dimension
that is, the absolute value of the diﬀerence between
Dq is always less than one!

What strikes most about the sequence

n=2l, l = 1, 2, . . ., when compared with its ‘self-
conjugate’ counterpart D(2)
l described in [1], are the following two facts: 1) it copies Dq within a
greater interval of values of l (1
6 only [1]);
it is for 1
and 2) the correspondence terminates at Dq=0 ≃
137.082 . . . – the value that is believed to be
very close to the inverse value of the ﬁne structure constant [2,9]. It is especially the latter fact
which may be regarded as a further justiﬁcation of the prominent role this constant is supposed
(∞) as well [9].

3. Conclusion

The theory outlined in [1] and the present paper strongly suggests that we could gain some
important physical insights into the nature of transﬁnite heterotic string space-time making use of
the concepts of homaloidal nets and plane Cremona transformations. It is our hope that the two
papers will elicit the interest of other physicists to explore its further possibilities so that we may
soon know whether the extremely exciting prospects implicit in this rigorous arithmetic-algebraic
approach are real or illusory.

Abstract

Normally one plots separation energies S1n and S2n as a function of neu-
tron number N for a particular proton number Z or plot S1p and S2p as a
function of Z for a particular N. Here we plot the separation energies a little
diﬀerently: S1n and S2n as a function of Z for a particular N. The same
with S1p and S2p as a function of N for a particular Z. A systematic study
of these new plots brings out certain very interesting generic features which
clearly indicate presence of triton (”t”) 3

in nuclei.

In the study of nuclear structure, separation energies have played an
important role and are continuing to do so in identifying new magic numbers
in recent years [1-4]. In all such studies one normally plots separation energies
S1n and S2n as a function of neutron number N for a particular proton number
Z or plot S1p and S2p as a function of Z for a particular N.

1H2 and helion (”h”) 3

We plot the separation energies a little diﬀerently here. We plot S1n and
S2n as a function of Z for a particular N. The same with S1p and S2p as a
function of N for a particular Z. We do a sytematic study of these plots for
all the data available in literature at present [5]. Such plots have completely
been ignored in literature. This is very unfortunate as these plots do contain
huge amount of interesting and revealing information which has been missed
so far. We shall show that these brings out certain very interesting generic
features which as we shall ﬁnd clearly indicate strong evidences of triton
(”t”) 3

2He1 clustering in nuclei
We study the whole range of data set available [5]. However as all this
will take much more space than necessary for this paper, here we show a
few representative plots. These are one and two neutron separation energy
as a function of Z for N = 29 and 30 as plotted in Fig 1 and 2 below. All
the plots of S1n and S2n as a function of Z for a particular N show similar
features. The same with S1p and S2p as a function of N for a particular Z.
We do a sytematic study of these plots for all the data. The features which
we shall point out here are there in all the other plots. In fact we shall study
here only those features which are generic of all such plots. Special studies
of speciﬁc set of nuclei ( which too would be very fruitful ) shall be left for
separate future studies.

Certain common feautres which stand out are as follows (The statements
below are made in the context of the plot S1n and S2n as a function of Z for
a particular N):

A. For all even-even N=Z nuclei there is always a pronounced larger
separation energy required with respect to the lower adjoining nuclei plotted.

B. For all odd-odd N=Z nuclei there is always a pronounced larger sepa-

ration energy required with respect to the lower adjoining nuclei plotted.

C. For case A when Z number is changed by one unit, the separation en-
ergy hardly changes (sometimes not at all). But when this number is changed

2

by two units, another pronounced peak occurs.

D. For case B when Z number is changed by one unit, the separation en-
ergy hardly changes (sometimes not at all). But when this number is changed
by two units, another pronounced peak occurs. So there are peaks for odd-odd
N-Z nuclei ( and not for even-even cases ).

Note that for example here we are plotting S1n and S2n as a function of Z
for a particular N. Hence while we are pulling one or two N we are studying
this as fuction of Z. Thus the above eﬀects cannot be the result of identical
nucleon pairings, What these plots are telling us is as to what happens to
last one or two neutron bindings in a nucleus as proton number changes.

Clearly the peaks as indicated in A above are due to the fact that the
last one or two neutrons must have come from a stable alpha cluster. This
is consolidated by the fact that another extra Z does not make a diﬀerence
to the saparation energy.

To understand observation B above - note that here the peaks are there
for ALL odd-odd N=Z nuclei. This is an amazing fact. These odd-odd nuclei
are more stable or ”magic” with respect to the adjoining odd-even or even-
odd nuclei. Pairing of identical nucleons cannot explain this generic feature.
Neither can alpha clustering do so. Obviously it is the formation of triton-
helion ’h-t’ pair which can only explain this extraordinary eﬀect. This is the
minimal requiremet without which one just cannot explain the generic eﬀect
indicated in ’B’. Just as alpha clustering explains the extra stability for case
A so does the formation of ’h-t’ cluster pair can only exlain the data in B.
What I would like to emphasize here is that the above conclusion is in-
escapable as per the empirical information manisfested in separtation energy
It is Nature which is forcing this
plotted in the manner indicated above.
conclusion upon us.

To understand observations C and D we have to undertand new empirical

studies on neurton rich nuclei.

Going through the binding energy systematics of neutron rich nuclei one
notices that as the number of α’s increases along with the neutrons, each
4He + 2n pair tends to behave like a cluster of two 3
1H2 nuclein [6]. Hence
the author had concluded that all light neutron rich nuclei 3Z
A2Z are made
Z
up of Z number of 3
1H2 clusters. There are good empirical evidence for this.
Separation energy studies like above support this conclusion too [7]. We

3

plotted separation energies for neutron number N and for proton number Z
ﬁxed separately at 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 22 and 24. We found extra-
ordinary stabilty manifested by the plotted data for the proton and neutron
pairs (Z,N): (6,12), (8,16), (10,20), (11,22) and (12,24). These new magicities
were present in the neutron rich sector for the pair (Z,N) where N=2Z.

What is the signiﬁcance of this extraordianry stabilty or magicity for all
the nuclei 3Z
A2Z? Quite clearly the only way we can explain the extra magic-
Z
ity for these N=2Z nuclei is by invoking the signiﬁcance of triton clustering
in the ground state of these neutron rich nuclei. So the nucleus 3Z
A2Z is
Z
made up of Z number of triton clusters.

To understand this unique feature the author introduced a new symmetry
”nusospin” symmetry [7]. Though the thrust of this paper is not this nu-
sospin summetry, the author would like to emphasize that triton and helion
clustering eﬀects in nuclei can be understood naturally in the framework of
the new nusospin symmetry.

So it is clear that it is tritons which explain the stabilty of neutron rich
nuclei and it it is pair of ’h-t’ clusters which explain the stabilty of odd-odd
N=Z nuclei in the separation energy as plotted above.

Now we can explain the obseravtion C above. Clearly for even-even N=Z
nuclei it is one ( or more ) alpha clusters which explain the data. Hence one
extra Z does not aﬀect the separation energy. But two extra Z will tend to
make a pair of helions ( akin to the two tritons for neutron rich case above
). These two ’h-h’ will make for the extra stabilty for the adjoing even-even
nuclei (and so on). So also can the observation D be understood as the extra
2Z will create an extra helion to attach to the already existing ’h-t’ pair to
make for extra stabilty of this adjoining odd-odd nuclei. Other peaks in the
above plots can be similarly explained as due to alpha or triton and helion
clusters.

The author would like to emphasize that quite obviusly these qualitative
conclusions are inescapable and unique. This is true as there is no other way
to explain the above empirical observations on the whole.

Abstract

Relativistic particles in the Kepler and Coulomb potentials may have trajectories that are qual-

itatively diﬀerent from the trajectories found in nonrelativistic mechanics. Spiral scattering tra-

jectories were pointed out by C. G. Darwin in 1913 in connection with the relativistic Rutherford

scattering of classical charged particles. Relativistic trajectories are of current interest in connec-

tion with Cole and Zou’s computer simulation of the hydrogen ground state in classical physics.

INTRODUCTION

The mechanics of a relativistic particle in a potential is usually treated as an afterthought

in classical mechanics textbooks. These textbooks usually begin with an extensive treat-

ment of nonrelativistic mechanics, then the energy and momentum of relativistic particles are

noted, and the corrections to the orbits of nonrelativistic particles are sometimes mentioned.1

However, relativistic particles in the familiar Kepler or Coulomb potential V (r) =

α/r can

−

have trajectories that are qualitatively diﬀerent from the trajectories found from nonrela-

tivistic mechanics, and these unfamiliar trajectories are not mentioned in the textbooks.2

For example, a relativistic particle in a 1/r potential can spiral into the force center (while

conserving mechanical energy and angular momentum). This behavior occurs because a

small increase in the velocity near the speed of light c can lead to a large increase in the

mass m/(1

v2/c2)1/2 so that an increase in the kinetic energy will compensate the decrease

−

in the potential energy as the radius decreases, thus keeping the total energy constant. In

addition, the increase in the linear momentum will compensate the decrease in the radius to

keep the angular momentum constant. The existence of such trajectories has played a role

in recent research.3,4

The potential V (r) =

α/r (α > 0) appears in the Kepler problem of gravitational

−

physics and in the attraction of point charges in electrostatics. The theory of gravitation

ﬁnds its relativistic form in general relativity and electrostatics has a natural extension into

electrodynamics. However, we will not discuss these extended theories. The problem we

consider has no curved spacetime and no radiation; it is the relativistic mechanics of a

particle in a 1/r potential.

As a ﬁrst example of the unfamiliar nature of some relativistic particle trajectories, we

show that if the angular momentum is too small, there are no circular orbits for a relativis-

tic particle in a 1/r potential. In contrast, in nonrelativistic mechanics, such a situation

never occurs; there are always nonrelativistic circular orbits unless the angular momentum

vanishes.

We follow the traditional procedure for the classiﬁcation of trajectories for a particle,

noting the orbits that undergo a qualitative transformation in the nonrelativistic limit and

those that do not. The equations of the trajectories are then obtained. We ﬁnd the familiar

scattering trajectories and the familiar rosette shapes that appear in texts on old quantum

2

theory,5 and also C. G. Darwin’s spiraling trajectories,2 which do not appear in textbooks.

Finally, we mention the research context in which these spiral trajectories have recently

become of interest.

III. LIMITING ANGULAR MOMENTUM FOR RELATIVISTIC CIRCULAR OR-

BITS

For circular orbits, the particle displacement r from the center of the potential is perpen-

dicular to the velocity v, and the angular momentum L is perpendicular to the plane of the

orbit. The magnitude of the angular momentum in the nonrelativistic case is

and in the relativistic case

If we now use the angular momentum to remove either r or v, we ﬁnd for the nonrelativistic

Because both v and r can take all values between zero and inﬁnity in nonrelativistic me-

chanics, it follows that any value of the angular momentum Lnr can lead to a circular orbit.

The same procedure in the relativistic case leads to

case

or

In the relativistic case, we have an upper limit for the speed v = c, and accordingly a lower

limit on the magnitude of the angular momentum for a circular orbit. As seen in Eq. (12),

we must have6

Thus there is a qualitative distinction for circular orbits between nonrelativistic and rela-

tivistic mechanics for the potential V (r) =

α/r, and only for this potential.7 The limiting

value of the angular momentum in the relativistic case is Lα = α/c. In contrast, in non-

relativistic mechanics there is no limiting speed and thus no lower limit on the angular

momentum for circular orbits.

The actual value of the limiting angular momentum Lα for the 1/r potential depends on

the magnitude of α. For an electron of charge e in the ﬁeld of a nucleus of atomic number

Z, α = Ze2, and the limiting angular momentum can be written as Lα = Zm(e2/mc2)c =
Z(e2/~c)~. Thus for an electron in the Coulomb potential of hydrogen , the limiting angular

angular momentum that is close to that given by Planck’s constant. Our discussion involves

only relativistic classical mechanics, not quantum mechanics.

IV. CLASSIFICATION OF TRAJECTORIES

The classiﬁcation of orbits for the potential V (r) =

α/r reﬂects the fact that some rela-

−

tivistic trajectories are qualitatively diﬀerent from those found in nonrelativistic mechanics.

The classiﬁcation can be made following the usual procedures of classical mechanics.1 The

motion is conﬁned to a plane so that the velocity can be written in terms of polar coordinates
as r = ˆr ˙r + ˆθr ˙θ. Then we use the energy expression (4) and remove the ˙θ dependence in the

velocity in favor of the angular momentum L to obtain a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation in

the radial variable r as a function of time. We will carry out the procedure for the relativistic

case and then take the nonrelativistic limit to connect with the familiar Kepler orbits.

In terms of polar coordinates, the relativistic angular momentum is

In the following, it will turn out that the limiting angular momentum, Lα = α/c, that

appears in the analysis of circular orbits, represents a crucial limiting value.

It is useful

to have certain constraints on the energy which are associated with this limiting angular

momentum. Because the particle velocity is less than c, we see from Eqs. (14) and (15) that

The general character of the turning points in the nonrelativistic equation (22) is con-

turning point analysis is qualitatively the same for both the relativistic and nonrelativistic

(α2

appear in the nonrelativistic case. We will see these new trajectories when we obtain the

which is the standard nonrelativistic result for the hyperbolas, parabolas, and ellipses of

Kepler orbits.

The various types of orbits are sketched in Figs. 1–5, showing bound and unbound rela-

tivistic trajectories. The unbound orbits, shown in Figs. 1–3, have a total relativistic energy

at least as large as the particle rest energy, E =

+ mc2

mc2. These orbits extend to

E

≥

spatial inﬁnity in at least one of their time limits. For L > α/c, these orbits are familiar

scattering orbits as shown in Fig. 1, where the orbit looks like a parabolic or hyperbolic

nonrelativistic orbit. However, for L > α/c but close to α/c, we are reminded that relativity

changes the familiar nonrelativistic scattering orbits. In Fig. 2 we see that the scattering

trajectory loops around the center of the potential before receding to inﬁnity. These loops do

not occur for the parabolic or hyperbolic orbits of nonrelativistic scattering. As L decreases

and becomes closer to α/c, the number of times the orbit loops around the potential center

increases. When L

α/c, the character of the trajectory changes. The orbital looping now

≤

9

continues all the way to the center of the potential; the unbound orbit extends to inﬁnity

in only one time direction and spirals into the potential center in the other (see Fig. 3). In

contrast, the parabolic and hyperbolic orbits of nonrelativistic mechanics never reach the

center of the potential, unless L = 0.

The bound orbits have total energy E smaller than the particle rest energy, E =

+mc2 <

E

mc2, corresponding to negative values of

= E

mc2. In nonrelativistic mechanics, all the

E

−

bound orbits are ellipses unless Lnr = 0. For L > α/c, the relativistic orbits take the rosette

shape of precessing ellipses shown in Fig. 4. These orbits have two turning points. The

orbits are familiar as the Sommerfeld relativistic orbits of old quantum theory,5 and reduce

to the familiar ellipses in the nonrelativistic limit. For L

α/c, the relativistic orbits spiral

out from the center of the 1/r potential and back into the center at early and late times as

shown in Fig. 5. In the nonrelativistic limit, these orbits become straight-line trajectories

for Lnr = 0.

From Eqs. (34) and (36), we ﬁnd that all the trajectories involve ﬁnite time changes for

ﬁnite changes in r or θ. For the trajectories with L

α/c (which spiral into the potential

center), the particles arrive at the potential center in a ﬁnite time starting from a ﬁnite

radius. This result can be seen from Eq. (34) which connects the change in the radius r

with the elapsed time. For L = α/c, an expansion for small r gives an integral of the form

≤

≤

which is well behaved at the lower limit. If L < α/c, an expansion for small r gives

The square root is real because of the condition L < α/c, and again the integral is ﬁnite.

Thus all the trajectories involve only ﬁnite times in the vicinity of the 1/r potential center.

VII. RELEVANCE OF THE TRAJECTORIES TO CURRENT RESEARCH

The existence of classical relativistic scattering trajectories that spiral into the center

of the 1/r potential while preserving energy and angular momentum was pointed out by

Darwin2 in 1913. Darwin’s analysis was made in connection with electron scattering based

10

on Rutherford’s model of the nuclear atom. In particular, Darwin was concerned with the

spiral trajectories and suggested that they should not occur in nature because they would

cause chemical transmutation. He speculated that “There must therefore be some way by

which the electron can escape from the extreme neighborhood of the nucleus.”2 He suggested

that the presence of these unobserved spiral trajectories indicated a further failure of classical

electromagnetic theory to describe experimental observation. Darwin’s work was published

just before Bohr proposed his stationary-state model of the atom.

Although Darwin was concerned primarily with the Rutherford scattering problem of

relativistic mechanics, he estimated the radiative corrections for his scattering trajectories.

It is interesting that a relativistic treatment of the old classical problem of radiative atomic

collapse gives a diﬀerent result from the familiar nonrelativistic treatment.

In both the

nonrelativistic and relativistic analyses, the radiative loss of mechanical energy as a charged

classical particle moves in a Coulomb potential is such as to make the orbit more circular. In

the nonrelativistic treatment, the charged particle radiates an inﬁnite amount of energy as

it spirals into the center at ever higher speed and ever lower energy

→ −∞
However, in the relativistic case, the radiative loss of energy ends when the particle speed

Enr =

−

.

Ze2/2r

in the circular orbit has reached the limit v

c, the angular momentum in Eq. (13) has

reached L

Ze2/c, the radius in Eq. (12) has shrunk to r

0, and the total energy in

→

→

0. Thus a charged particle of rest energy mc2 that starts at a

→
Eq. (23) has reached E

→

large radius and small velocity with total energy E = mc2 will radiate away the energy mc2,

and not the divergent radiation energy found in the nonrelativistic treatment.

Today, physicists are not concerned about Darwin’s spiral trajectories nor the ﬁnite radi-

ation energy loss given by a relativistic treatment of atomic collapse. Of course, most physi-

cists are not aware of their existence, because quantum mechanics has changed our views of

the atom and has made such awareness unnecessary. However, occasionally some researchers

are interested to see just how far one can push a classical or semi-classical interpretation

of atomic physics.

It has been suggested8 that the inclusion of classical electromagnetic

zero-point radiation might allow an understanding of electron motion as a sort of Brownian

motion which avoids the problem of atomic collapse. Thus an electron might indeed lose

energy through radiation while accelerating in the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus, but the elec-

tron might also pick up energy from the zero-point radiation. The balance between these

two eﬀects might account for atomic structure.

11

Recently Cole and Zou3 have carried out simulations of the classical hydrogen ground state

assuming classical zero-point radiation. They conclude that the electron neither falls into the

nucleus nor is ionized, but rather assumes a stationary probability distribution. This ground

state probability distribution approximates that given by the Schr¨odinger equation. This

agreement is remarkable and requires conﬁrmation and further understanding. However,

in contrast to these computer simulation results are various attempts to calculate the elec-

tron Brownian motion within the basic zero-point model using nonrelativistic mechanics.9

These analytic calculations suggest that the electron would not fall into the nucleus due

to radiation emission, but rather would be ejected from the atom (self-ionization) due to

the absorption of excessive zero-point energy in the plunging orbits of very small angular

momentum. However, as we have emphasized here, the nonrelativistic orbits of very small

angular momenta represent the region of failure of the nonrelativistic approximation. For

small angular momentum L < α/c, the correct relativistic orbits spiral in toward the nucleus

while conserving the total energy and angular momentum. This behavior will lead to a to-

tally diﬀerent interaction with zero-point radiation from that assumed in the nonrelativistic

calculations.9 Hence, the validity of the self-ionization conclusions in the analytic work are

questionable.4

We see that nearly a century after Darwin’s work, a knowledge of the orbits of a relativistic

particle in a 1/r potential again seems signiﬁcant. An understanding of the possibilities and

limitations of a classical or semi-classical treatment of hydrogen depends upon a correct

treatment of the mechanical trajectories of a relativistic particle in the Coulomb potential.

Mechanics (Dover, New York, 1994) (a republication of the 1960 edition). Goldstein, Poole, and

Safko discuss the relativistic one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in Sec. 7.9. Jose and Saletan

treat the relativistic Kepler problem in Sec. 5.1, but do not mention Darwin’s spiral trajectories.

2 Such orbits appear in the work of C. G. Darwin, “On some orbits of an electron,” Phil. Mag.

25, 201–210 (1913) in connection with the scattering of β particles in Rutherford’s model for an

atom. Darwin wrote just before the publication of Bohr’s model for hydrogen.

6 The existence of a lower limit for the angular momentum appears in the work of U. Torkelsson,

“The special and general relativistic eﬀects on orbits around point masses,” Eur. J. Phys. 19,

459–464 (1998). He remarks, “For relativistic motion in the Coulomb potential the centrifugal

barrier disappears at a small, but still ﬁnite, speciﬁc angular momentum.” He also notes that

“there are no stable orbits” for small angular momentum, L < α/c.

7 For no other potential of the form V (r) = krn, where k and n are constants, does relativity

restrict the appearance of circular orbits for non-zero angular momentum. This is easily found

by direct calculation analogous to that given in Eqs. (7)-(12).

momentum L >> α/c in a 1/r potential centered on the origin. The orbit is similar to a

parabolic or hyperbolic nonrelativistic scattering orbit.

Fig. 2. Sketch of an unbound orbit of energy E

mc2 and angular momentum L slightly

larger than α/c in a 1/r potential. Because L is only slightly larger than α/c, the orbit makes

loops around the scattering center. Such loops do not occur for an unbounded nonrelativistic

orbit which is always a parabola or hyperbola.

One end of the orbit is at inﬁnity and the other corresponds to a spiral into or out of the

center of the potential. The nonrelativistic limit corresponds to a straight line orbit with

L = 0.

Fig. 4. Sketch of a bound orbit of energy 0 < E < mc2 and angular momentum L > α/c.

The orbit has two turning points and, in the nonrelativistic limit, reduces to the familiar

elliptical orbit of nonrelativistic mechanics.

Fig. 5. Sketch of a bound orbit of energy E < mc2 and angular momentum L

α/c.

The orbit ends in spirals to and from the potential center. The nonrelativistic limit is a

straight line orbit with L = 0.

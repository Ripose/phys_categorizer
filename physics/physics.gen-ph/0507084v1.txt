Abstract

The Dirac particle

SD are diﬀerent dynamic systems.

SD is investigated by means of dynamic methods, i.e.
without a use of the principles of quantum mechanics. It is shown that the
Pauli particle
SnD of the Dirac parti-
SP and the nonrelativistic approximation
cle
SnD contains the high frequency degrees
SP. It means that the
of freedom, which are absent in the dynamic system
SnD is composite (i.e. it has internal degrees of
nonrelativistic Dirac particle
freedom), whereas the Pauli particle
SP is a pointlike particle with the spin.
In the absence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld the world line of the classical Pauli
SPcl is a timelike straight, whereas that of the classical nonrelativistic
particle
SnDcl is a helix. The characteristic frequency Ω = 2mc2/¯h of
Dirac particle
this helix is the threshold frequency of the pair production. Using dynamic
methods, one shows freely that the Copenhagen interpretation, when the wave
function is a speciﬁc quantum object describing the state of individual particle,
is incompatible with the quantum mechanics formalism. Besides, it is shown
that the momentum distribution in quantum mechanics is in reality the mean
momentum distribution. Eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent investigation strategies is
discussed and compared.

1 Introduction

It is common practice to think, that the Pauli particle, i.e. the dynamic system
SP, described by the Pauli equation, is a nonrelativistic approximation of the Dirac
SD, described by the Dirac equation [1]. In reality,
particle, i.e. the dynamic system
it appears that the nonrelativistic approximation
SD is a
SP, because
composite particle, which is more complicated than the Pauli particle

SnD of the Dirac particle

it has additional degrees of freedom, which absent at the Pauli particle. It can be
explained as follows.

The Dirac equation is the system of four ﬁrst order complex equations for four
complex dependent variables, whereas the Pauli equation is the system of two com-
plex ﬁrst order equations for two complex dependent variables (the order of diﬀer-
ential equation is determined by the highest order of time derivative). If the Pauli
equation is a nonrelativistic approximation of the Dirac equation, then why its order
is lower. The reduction of the order of diﬀerential equations is explained usually
by the fact that the coeﬃcients before the highest temporal derivatives are small in
the nonrelativistic approximation. These terms are neglected and the order of the
diﬀerential equation is reduced. On the other hand, it is well known that neglecting
the highest derivatives, we loss high frequency solutions. Indeed, if the temporal
frequency is large enough, the term with the highest derivative may become very
large, even if the coeﬃcient before the derivative is small. It means that we may
not neglect the highest derivatives without producing a proper investigation.

In the present paper we produce such an investigation, which shows that one
cannot neglect the terms, which are connected with the internal structure of the
Dirac particle. Recently [2] it has been shown that the classical Dirac particle
SDcl
has internal structure (additional degrees of freedom).
In the present paper it is
shown that in the nonrelativistic approximation the internal structure of the Dirac
particle takes place also.

From formal viewpoint the neglect of the high frequency solution is a mathe-
SD, and a very
matical mistake in the investigation of the Dirac dynamic system
interesting question arises. Why was the mathematical mistake in the transition
to the nonrelativistic approximation remaining to be unnoticed for eighty years af-
ter invention of the Dirac equation? The answer is very simple. Nobody looked
for this mistake. The quantum theory developed by means of the experimental-
ﬁtting methods, when the logical structure of a theory was a secondary circum-
stance. It was necessary to explain the enigmatic microcosm by any means. As a
result the quantum theory is founded on the enigmatic quantum principles, which
are nonrelativistic. There is nothing bad in application of the experimental-ﬁtting
method for explanation of concrete experiments and experimental data, because this
method admits one to introduce new concepts, which are characteristic for the con-
sidered physical phenomena. However, it leads to undesirable consequences, when
the experimental-ﬁtting method is applied to a construction of a physical theory.
In this case the method turns into a theoretical-ﬁtting method. Application of the
theoretical-ﬁtting method to a construction of a theory is ineﬀective, because it ad-
mits one to introduce new hypotheses and new concepts, but it does not admit one
to establish logical connections between diﬀerent concepts and explain some con-
cepts via other more fundamental concepts. The main goal of a physical theory is
a determination of logical connections between the physical concepts and deduction
of all concepts via some fundamental concepts. Any progress in reduction of the
number of the fundamental concepts and explanation of other concepts in terms of
the fundamental concepts is a real progress of a physical theory. Introducing new

2

hypotheses, the experimental-ﬁtting method enables to introduce new concepts, but
it does not admit one to establish logical connection between the physical concepts
and reduce the number of fundamental basic concepts. One should not use the
theoretical-ﬁtting method to determine the logical connections between the physical
concepts and to construct a satisfactory theory . Instead of the ﬁtting method one
should use the Newtonian deductive method with its slogan ”Hypotheses non ﬁngo”.
If we have serious problems with new physical phenomena, what are we to do?
According to the Newtonian slogan we should look for mistakes in the existing
physical theory, ﬁnd them and correct. The ﬁnding of mistakes in the foundation
of the existing physical theory is a very diﬃcult problem, because these mistakes
appear to be located in other branches of science (geometry, theory of dynamic
systems and theory of stochastic systems). In the beginning of the 20th century,
when the quantum theory arose, these mistakes were not discovered. The researchers
of the 20th century were forced to invent additional hypotheses (quantum principles),
which could compensate unknown mistakes in the foundation of the physical theory
In the same way Ptolemeus constructed his doctrine
of microcosm phenomena.
of the celestial mechanics, where the mistake concerning the Earth motion was
compensated by additional suppositions. The Ptolemaic doctrine described correctly
the motion of planets, but it cannot be used for discovery of the Newtons gravitation
law and for calculation of trajectories of rockets in their travel to other planets.
In the same way the contemporary quantum theory describes correctly the atomic
spectra and other nonrelativistic quantum phenomena, but it fails in the description
of the speciﬁc relativistic quantum phenomena. The Ptolemaic doctrine (as well as
the contemporary quantum theory) was a list of the prescriptions, which lead to true
experimentally tested predictions. But not all these prescription were connected
logically between themselves. Some of them were compatible only in some region
of parameters of the theory, and the doctrine cannot be applied outside this region.
List of these prescriptions did not form a logical structure, and the reason was an
incorrect fundamental supposition, concerning the Earth motion. The list of the
Ptolemaic prescriptions did not form a logical structure. It could be applied only
to the planet motion, but it could not be extended to motion of other celestial
bodies (comets, rockets). The Copernicus doctrine was a logical structure, because
it did not contain mistake concerning the Earth motion. It could be extended to
the motion of any celestial bodies.

Analogous situation takes place in the contemporary quantum theory, which also
forms a list of prescriptions, but not a logical structure. These prescriptions work
very well in the nonrelativistic phenomena of microcosm, but one fails to extend
them to relativistic phenomena of microcosm. The reason of this failure is condi-
tioned by the incorrect statements (mistakes) in the foundation of the contemporary
quantum theory.

We list the incorrect statements (mistakes), which must be corrected for a con-

struction of a satisfactory theory of microcosm phenomena.

1. The straight is a one-dimensional line in any space-time geometry. This state-

3

ment forbids space-time geometries, where the motion of free particles is pri-
mordially stochastic.

2. Any statistical description is produced in terms of the probability theory. This
statement forbids the dynamical conception of the statistical description, which
does not use the concept of the probability density as a main concept of the
statistical description.

3. The free particle Hamiltonian function H and its energy E, taken with the

opposite sign, always coincide (E =

H).

−

The fourth problem, which should be overcome, is not a mistake. It was a purely
mathematical problem. Without solving this problem, one cannot obtain the correct
interpretation of the wave function as a method of an ideal ﬂuid description. We
consider this problem in the second section.

Two ﬁrst points concern the quantum theory as a whole, whereas the third
point concerns only relativistic quantum theory. It concerns the problem of the pair
production and depreciates many papers on the relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory. We
show this in the example of the second quantization of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon
equation

∇2ψ + m2ψ =: λψ+ψψ :

(1.1)

where the speed of the light c = 1, the quantum constant ¯h = 1, and λ is the
constant of self-action.

At the secondary quantization the nonlinear term in rhs of (1.1) provides the

pair production, if one imposes some additional constraint [3, 4, 5, 6]

(1.2)

where T ik is the energy-momentum tensor. Conventionally the condition (1.2) is
considered to be the condition, which is necessary for the secondary quantization.
Nobody does not consider the conditions (1.2) as some additional constraints, which
are not necessary for the secondary quantization, and nobody tests compatibility of
constraints (1.2) with the dynamic equation (1.1). However, the secondary quanti-
zation of the equation (1.1) is possible without imposition of constraints (1.2) [7].
It means that the conditions (1.2) are additional constraints and compatibility of
constraints (1.2) with the dynamic equation (1.1) is to be tested. The test has been
made in [7]. It has been shown, that the relations (1.2) and (1.1) are compatible
only in the case, when the self-action constant λ = 0, and the dynamic equation
(1.1) is linear.

Thus, although the statement of the pair production problem in the form of two
relations (1.1) and (1.2) leads to the pair production eﬀect [3, 4, 5, 6], but this
result is not reliable, because the statement of the problem is inconsistent. Besides,
the mathematical formalism is imperfect, because it uses perturbation theory and
renormalization. Combination of the inconsistent statement of the problem with the

4

imperfect mathematical technique admits one to obtain any desirable result (in the
given case the eﬀect of pair production).

On the other hand, the secondary quantization of the equation (1.1) without
imposition of (1.2) provides the consistent statement of the problem with the perfect
nonperturbative mathematical technique (without renormalization). However, the
pair production eﬀect is absent at such a consistent statement of the problem [7].

−

What is the physical ground of the constraint (1.2), which leads to the pair
production eﬀect? If k = 0 the relation (1.2) describes the well known fact that
E, where H is the Hamilton function, deﬁned as the
for the free particle H =
quantity canonically conjugate to the time t, and E is the particle energy, deﬁned as
an integral of the component T 00 of the energy-momentum tensor. But this relation
is valid only in the case, when the pair production is absent [8].
In the general
case, when there is the pair production, the imposition of constraint (1.2) means
that the description is produced in terms of particles and antiparticles, which are
considered as diﬀerent dynamic systems [8]. The number of objects is indeﬁnite,
and one is forced to use the perturbative methods. On the contrary, absence of
the constraint (1.2) means that the description is produced in terms of world lines,
which are considered as the fundamental objects of dynamics. The number of these
extended objects is ﬁxed, and one may use nonperturbative methods of investigation
(see details in [7]).

Dynamics, where the dynamic system (particle) exists only some time and dis-
appears at some time moment after collision with the dynamic anti-system (antipar-
ticle), is inconsistent. The technique of classical dynamic systems does not admit
one to use such a dynamical description. However, the same tecnique admits one to
describe this collision, if a particle and an antiparticle are diﬀerent states of the same
physical object (world line), and evolution of the dynamic system is determined by
a parameter changing monotone along the world line. In this case the collision leads
only to a transition from one state to another. Mathematical technique of quantum
theory also cannot overcome the diﬃculty, connected with particle and antiparticle
as diﬀerent dynamic systems. The belief, that we can overcome this diﬃculty, in-
troducing creation and annihilation operators, is delusive. It is a reason, why the
relations (1.1) and (1.2) are incompatible, and it is the third point in the list of
mistakes.

It means that a simple addition of the nonlinear term to the linear Klein-Gordon
equation does not provide the pair production eﬀects. The reasons, generating the
pair production, have a more complicated structure, than a simple product of the
creation and annihilation operators. Besides, these reasons have a classical analog
in the form of speciﬁc force ﬁelds. (See for details [9]).

We see in the considered example, that the quantum principles do not work in
application to the relativistic quantum systems, or at least, they are not eﬀective in
application to them. There is a hope that the relativistic quantum systems can be
investigated more eﬀectively by dynamical methods, which do not use the quantum
principles.

The above-mentioned mistakes look very simple, and it is very diﬃcult to believe

5

that a correction of these incorrect statements could lead to a construction of a sat-
isfactory theory of the microcosm phenomena. However, these mistakes underlie of
the contemporary quantum theory of microcosm phenomena, and correction of them
is very important for further development of the microcosm phenomena theory. In
particular, correction of the ﬁrst mistake leads to construction of the new conception
of geometry [10] and to a revision of our space-time conception in the microcosm.
The scale of this revision is comparable with the scale of revision connected with
appearance of the relativity theory [11]. Correction of the second mistake lead to a
construction of the dynamical conception of the statistical description. Dynamical
methods of this conception are used in the present paper. But we apply the dynam-
ical methods without a reference to their physical foundation. The fact, that the
dynamical methods have appeared in accordance with the Newtonian investigation
strategy as a result of correction of a mistake, is very important from the logical
viewpoint.

Unfortunately, this fact is of no importance for contemporary pragmatic theo-
rists, educated on the experimental-ﬁtting method of investigation. They do not
believe in any foundation and trust only in eﬀectiveness of the applied investiga-
tion methods.
In the given case I prefer to use their rules, in order the paper
were transparent for most readers, educated on the experimental-ﬁtting method of
investigation.

As concerns the third mistake, it is not yet corrected properly in the sense that
the eﬀective theory of the pair production eﬀect is not yet constructed. It is clear
only, that application of the quantum principles in solution of this problem leads to
the blind alley.

In this paper we show that the dynamical methods of investigation (without a
use of quantum principles) are founded logically. Besides, they are more eﬀective in
application to the investigation of the Dirac particle, than the conventional methods,
based on the application of quantum principles.

2 Dynamical methods of investigation

We use a more developed mathematical technique for a description of quantum
systems. This technique supposes that all essential information on the quantum
dynamical system is contained in the dynamic system itself. Such speciﬁc quan-
tum concepts as the wave function and principles of quantum mechanics appear to
be only the means of description. The wave function as the means of description
may be applied to both quantum and classical dynamic systems. But the quantum
principles may be applied only to quantum dynamic systems, because they contains
some constraints, which are not satisﬁed for classical systems. The quantum system
and classical system distinguish dynamically (in additional terms in the action), but
not in the way of description. This fact becomes to be clear, when both systems
are described in the same terms. For instance, the quantum system and the corre-
sponding classical system may be described in terms of the wave function, or both

6

systems may be described in terms of the particle position and momentum. The
diﬀerence between the various methods of description lies only in the convenience of
their application. A use of the wave function is eﬀective in description of quantum
systems, because in this case the dynamic equations are linear. On the contrary, the
description in terms of the particle position is convenient for description of classical
systems, where dynamic equations are ordinary diﬀerential equations.

Progress in the development of the mathematical technique has a mathematical
ground: integration of dynamic equations. This pure mathematical achievement has
physical consequences. It appears that the quantum mechanics may be considered
to be a statistical description of randomly moving particles. We underline that we
investigate well known quantum systems, and all new results are corollaries of the
more developed methods of investigation. It is meaningless to argue against the new
obtained results by a reference to experimental data, because such arguments are
arguments against the considered dynamic systems, but not against the methods of
investigation. Experimental data may not be arguments against the mathematical
methods of investigation in principle. As to the investigated dynamic systems, we
admit that they may be imperfect and need an improvement, but this problem lies
outside the framework of the paper.

together with the restrictions imposed on its applications as the quantum principles,
because von Neumann has shown [12], that the quantum mechanics can be deduced

the quantum principles, which are something external with respect to the dynamic

course, the trajectories x = x (t, ξ) do not describe the motion of individual stochas-
tic particles. They describe only statistical average motion of stochastic particles.
The situation reminds situation in the gas dynamics. The dynamic equations of
the gas dynamics describe the motion of the ”gas particles”, which contain many
molecules. Motion of the gas molecules is random and chaotic. It cannot be de-
scribed by the gas dynamics equations, which describe only regular component of
the molecule motion.

Note, that the term m

(2.16) it does not depend on the temporary derivative ˙x, and in dynamic equations
it acts as a potential energy.

On the contrary, the dynamic equations, generated by the action (2.1), are lin-

of the action (2.9) admits a simple interpretation, but dynamic equations are very
complicated for a solution.

E

If the actions (2.1) and (2.9) describe the same dynamic system (further for
brevity we shall speak about equivalence of dynamic systems (2.1) and (2.9), al-
though in reality the action (2.1) is only a partial case of the action (2.9)), it is

form in terms of the wave function.
Why was this evident circumstance not used before? Why was the problem of
the stochastic motion of microparticles stated in terms of enigmatic wave function?
The answer is very simple. The connection between two diﬀerent forms (2.1) and
(2.9) of the action for the Schr¨odinger particle has not been known for a long time.
It is known, that the Schr¨odinger equation can be written in the hydrodynamical
form [14]. D. Bohm [15] used this circumstance for the hydrodynamic interpretation
of quantum mechanics. But it was only interpretation of the quantum principles in
the hydrodynamical terms. He failed to eliminate the quantum principles and the
wave function from the foundation of the quantum mechanics, and the wave function
remained to be an enigmatic object – the vector in the Hilbert space. One failed
to connect the wave function with the hydrodynamic variables: the density ρ and
the velocity v. In more exact terms the connection between the wave function and
hydrodynamic variables ρ, v was established, but it was a one-way connection. In the
case of the irrotational ﬂow the hydrodynamical variables can be expressed via the
wave function ψ, but one cannot do this in the case of the irrotational ﬂow. Hence,
one can transit from the description in terms of the wave function to the description
in terms of ρ, v, but one cannot transit from the hydrodynamic description in terms
of ρ, v to a description in terms of ψ, because, in general, the ﬂuid ﬂow is rotational,
and the dynamic system (2.9) cannot be described in terms of the one-component
wave function.

Let us present the wave function in the form
ψ = √ρeiϕ,

substitute it in the Schr¨odinger equation (2.2) and separate the real and imaginary
parts of the equation. We obtain two real equations

The hydrodynamic equations (2.22) are obtained as a result of diﬀerentiation of
the equation (2.2), written in terms of the wave function. It means that to transit
from the hydrodynamic equations (2.22) to the equation, written in terms of the
wave function, one needs to integrate the hydrodynamic equations (2.22). Besides,
in the case of the irrotational ﬂow the wave function is presented in terms of ρ and
hydrodynamical potential ϕ. The same is valid in the general case, but the number
of the hydrodynamical potentials is to be more than one, and it is necessary to
introduce additional hydrodynamic (Clebsch) potentials.

The problem of integration of the hydrodynamical equations is rather compli-
cated problem, which has been solved only in the end of eighties [16]. To solve this
problem, it was necessary to develop a special Jacobian technique [13], which was
used already by Clebsch [17, 18].

As soon as the hydrodynamic equations for the ideal ﬂuid have been integrated,
it becomes clear, that the wave function is simply a method of the ideal ﬂuid de-
scription. The wave function ψ ceases to be an enigmatic vector of the Hilbert space,
whose meaning was obtained only via quantum principles. Now one can determine
the chain of the dynamic variable transformations which turn the action (2.9) into
the action (2.7) (for details see Appendix A). As a result the action (2.9) may be

used as a starting point for the description of the quantum Schr¨odinger particle
At such a description the quantum principles (2.6) are not needed, because they are
only a tool for interpretation of the wave function.

The statistical ensemble (2.9) as the starting point of the quantum description

has a series of advantages over the action (2.1):

1. The statistical ensemble (2.9) is a very transparent construction founded on
the simple physical idea, that the quantum particle is a stochastically moving
particle.

2. It does not use quantum principles, which are nonrelativistic and cannot be

extended properly to the relativistical case.

3. Statistical ensemble (2.9) is a more general construction, because the action

(2.1) is a partial case of the action (2.9).

4. In the statistical description, founded on the action (2.9), there are three
diﬀerent aspects: dynamical factor, statistical factor and random factor. Each
of these factors can be separated as a corresponding term in the action and
investigated apart.

12

5. Description in terms of the dynamic system (2.9) is a statistical description.
As any statistical description it contains two objects: the individual stochas-
tic particle
. Respectively there
individual measurement (S-measurement)
are two kinds of measurements:
produced over the individual particle
Sst and the massive measurement (M-
. These mea-
measurement) produced over the statistical average particle
surements have diﬀerent properties, and their identiﬁcation is inadmissible.

Sst and the statistical average particle

The complexity of dynamic equations (2.17) is the only defect of the statistical

description (2.9).

We underline that the transition from the action (2.9) as a starting point to the
action (2.1) is motivated mathematically. No additional physical arguments have
been used for the substantiation of the statistical ensemble (2.9) as a starting point
of the quantum description.

If we consider stationary states of the statistical ensemble, we are interested only
in the value of the magnetic moment (which is supposed to be connected with the
value of the total spin).
In this case the spin origin is of no importance. But if
we investigate the individual particle structure, it is important, whether the spin is
generated by the individual particle, or it is generated by vorticity of the ﬂuid ﬂow.
It is meaningless to classify the particles over their spin, if the spin has a collective
origin, and the individual particle has not its own angular moment. If we use the
conventional approach to the quantum mechanics, i.e.
if we start from the action
(2.1) we cannot separate dynamical and collective properties directly. Only starting
from the action (2.9), we can try to solve this problem for concrete dynamic systems
(for instance, the Dirac particle

stands on the viewpoint of the Copenhagen interpretation, where the wave function

SP).

The collective origin of the spin can be perceived, only using statistical approach
presented by the action (2.9). The statistical description, founded on the action (2.9)
leads to the statement that wave function describes a state of the statistical ensemble
Sst], but not a state of a single quantum particle. Discussion of the question, what
[
E
object is described by the wave function, has a long history. Some researchers [19]
believe, that the wave function describes the state of a single quantum particle,
whereas other ones [20, 21] believe that the wave function describes the state of the
statistical ensemble. There is a long list of diﬀerent opinions about this question,
but we do not present them, because this problem is not a question of a belief. It
can and must be solved on the basis of the mathematical formalism.

The problem is set as follows. What dynamic system is described by the action
(2.1)? A single quantum particle, or a statistical ensemble of single particles? Let

The action (2.28) describes the statistical ensemble of free classical particles and,
hence, the wave function describes the statistical ensemble, but not a single particle.
The action (2.28) may not describe a single classical particle, because the dynamic
system (2.28) has inﬁnite number of the freedom degrees. As far as the description
(2.28) in terms of the wave function Ψb is a limit ¯h
0 of the description in terms of
the wave function ψ, the wave function ψ in (2.1) may not describe a single quantum
particle. Thus, the supposition that the wave function describes a state of a single
particle is incompatible with the quantum mechanics formalism.

The transformation (2.24) changes only the scale of the wave function phase
ln(ψ/
), and this change may be very slight. The wave function Ψb is the valid
wave function, which can be used, in particular, for calculation of average values by
means of the relation (2.6). This calculation may be produced for any value of the
constant b. The wave function Ψb describes the same state of
SS at diﬀerent values
of the parameter b, because the state of the dynamic system does not determine
the wave function uniquely, and the same state of
SS may be described by diﬀerent
wave functions. From viewpoint of the statistical description (2.9) the wave function
is not uniquely deﬁned, because it is constructed of hydrodynamic potentials, i.e.
it is a result of integration of uniquely deﬁned velocity v. The parameter b in the
transformation (2.6) is a constant of integration.

We may set b = ¯h in the relations (2.28), (2.29) and obtain a description of

”classical particle ” in the form containing the quantum constant ¯h.

from the action (2.1) in the last term, which describes a lack of quantum eﬀects.
The quantum constant in two ﬁrst terms has no relation to quantum eﬀects. The

The rule (2.6) is only a method to obtain the information contained in the
investigated dynamic system. This information can be obtained from the dynamic
system by other methods. An application of the rule (2.6) does not add any real
information beyond that one, which is contained in the investigated dynamic system.

3 Dynamic disquantization

The quantum langauge, i.e. the description, containing the quantum constant ¯h,
may be used for a description of a classical dynamic system, because the quantum
constant ¯h may be used instead of the arbitrary dynamical constant b. Replacement
of dynamical constant b by the quantum constant is produced to make the dynamic
equations to be linear. For instance, in the action (2.25) the quantum constant ¯h

17

in the sense that setting ¯h = 0, we suppress the quantum
is used naturally, i.e.
eﬀects. In the action (2.1) for the same dynamic system the quantum constant ¯h
is used artiﬁcially in the sense that setting ¯h = 0, we do not suppress the quantum
eﬀects. Furthermore, setting ¯h = 0, we destroy any description. But the action (2.1)
generates linear dynamic equation, and this circumstance is a reason of the artiﬁcial
identiﬁcation b = ¯h, when the dynamical constant b is identiﬁed with the quantum
constant ¯h.

Such an artiﬁcial identiﬁcation may be produced in other quantum systems (for
SP), and we cannot be sure, that setting ¯h = 0, we suppress
instance, in
the quantum eﬀects. Besides, we cannot be sure that, using the transformation of
the type (2.24), we can separate the quantum terms from dynamical and statistical
ones.

respect to ξα, α = 1, 2, 3, whereas dynamic equations (3.2) are ordinary diﬀerential
equations. Equations (3.2) contain derivatives only in one direction in the space of

If we want to suppress the quantum eﬀects, we must to reduce the system of

make this, we should project derivatives in the space of independent variables onto
some direction. Then the system will contain derivatives only in one direction, and
hence it may be reduced to the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Onto what

but not a function of x, because the quantity ψ2 is to satisfy equation (4.10), and
it is possible only if w0 =const). In the general case, when ψ1 has the form (4.25),

where (c.c.) means the expression, which is complex conjugate to the previous term.
Note that the Dirac particle is charged. It means that the states of the Dirac
particle, containing oscillating charge density ej0, or oscillating current density ej,
are unstable with respect to electromagnetic radiation. As a result of the electro-
magnetic emanation, the Dirac particle transits to such a state, where jk does not
depend on time. Such a situation takes place for the states of the electron in the
atom. Only stationary states, where jk does not depend on time, are stable. The
frequency Ω = 2mc2/¯h is very high, and the instability is very strong in the sense,
that the time of transition to the stable state is very short.

It follows from the expressions (4.32) and (4.33), that if the state of the Dirac

Expressions (5.4) – (5.7) can be obtained also by conventional method, i.e. as a
nonrelativistic approximation of exact solutions of the Dirac equation in the form of
plane waves. The quantities with index ’lf’ are obtained from solution for the positive
value of the temporal component k0 =
of the canonical momentum,
whereas the quantities with index ’hf’ are obtained from solution for the negative
value of the temporal component k0 =
of the canonical momentum.
Let us return to investigation of stability conditions (4.35), (4.38). We consider
(cid:12)
only the case, when Ak = 0,
πµ = i¯h∂µ. The low frequency plane wave is

Stable superposition of Ψlf and of Ψhf is impossible. In the stable states Ψlf and

stable states of the Dirac particle the superselection rule takes place.

6 Classical approximation of the nonrelativistic

Dirac particle

To make the dynamic disquantization, we need to introduce hydrodynamic variables,
where the current jk were the dependent variable instead of ψ. Transforming the
action (4.1), we use the mathematical technique [23, 24], where the wave function ψ
is considered to be a function of hypercomplex numbers γ and coordinates x. In this
case the physical quantities are obtained by means of a convolution of expressions
ψ∗Oψ with the zero divisor. This technique allows one to work without ﬁxing the
γ-matrices representation.

on the position x. As to the velocity, all terms in the relation (7.9) for the velocity
are of the same order, and we may not neglect the two last terms in (7.9). The
additional terms give a very small contribution to the particle position, but they
introduce additional degrees of freedom, which are rather rigid . These degrees of
freedom cannot be excited at the low energies, characteristic for the atomic spectra.
The characteristic energy, connected with these degrees of freedom is of the order
¯hω = 2mc2.
In other words, it is a characteristic threshold energy of the pair

Note that the action (6.20) for the nonrelativistic classical Dirac particle as well
as the dynamic equation (7.1) does not contain the term, describing interaction
of the magnetic moment with the magnetic ﬁeld, what is characteristic for the
nonrelativistic Pauli equation. This interaction may be obtained, if we take the
high frequency solution (7.9) and average the action (6.20) over the frequency ω,
determined by the relation (7.11). In reality, it is necessary to average only the term

The action (8.9) diﬀers from the action for the classical Pauli particle in the sense
that it depends on the free parameter V . This parameter describes the intensity of
the high frequency rotation. To obtain the action for the classical Pauli particle we
should identify the variable ξ with the particle spin and set V = c√2. Although this
value of the velocity is relativistic and unreal, the contribution of the high frequency
term in the action (8.9) has the same form as in the action for the classical Pauli
particle.

Note that taking for averaging the relativistical expressions (7.16), or (7.19) for

V and ω, we obtain instead of V = c√2 another expressions, where

9 Concluding remarks

This paper is devoted to comparison of the Newtonian strategy and the experimental-
ﬁtting strategy in their application to the microcosm investigation. In this compar-
ison we underline the role of mistakes in the foundation of physical theory. These
mistakes are actual only in the theory of microcosm phenomena. It was the mis-
takes, that have lead to a replacement of the Newtonian strategy, dominating in 19th
century, by the Ptolemaic experimental-ﬁtting approach, dominating in microcosm
investigations of 20th century. The Ptolemaic approach and experimental-ﬁtting
way of thinking are the main obstacles on the path of development of the satisfac-
tory fundamental microcosm theory. The Ptolemaic approach works very well at
investigation of concrete physical phenomena, because it is insensitive to mistakes
in the foundation of the theory. However, it is not adequate for construction of
a fundamental physical theory, because it create only list of predictions, but not a
logical structure. Extension of a fundamental theory to the new region of relativistic
microcosm phenomena is produced easier, if the theory is a logical structure, but
not a list of prescriptions. Discovery and correction of mistakes is the only way for
construction of a logical structure instead of the Ptolemaic list of predictions. In
such a situation it is very important to distinguish between a mistake and a simple
deﬁciency of our knowledge, as well as between the mistake and incorrect hypothesis.
A mistake is an incorrect information, whereas a deﬁciency of knowledge is simply
a lack of information. A hypothesis may be correct in some situation and invalid in
other situation. A hypothesis may be justiﬁed or removed, because it lies outside
the logical structure of the satisfactory theory. On the contrary, the mistake must be
discovered and corrected. It is contained in the logical structure of the satisfactory
theory and it may not be ignored. Unfortunately, the experimental-ﬁtting approach
does not distinguish between a mistake and an incorrect hypothesis, because at this
approach a theory is a list of prescriptions having equal importance, but not a logical
structure.

The most contemporary researchers of microcosm are educated in the Ptole-
maic experimental-ﬁtting approach. The Newtonian approach is unknown for them,
although it is not a new approach. They believe that any theory, which explain
experimental data, is a good theory. Of course, the experimental-ﬁtting approach
has an historical reason, but, when the main mistakes are discovered and corrected,
the list of prescriptions can and must be replaced by a logical structure. Now there
is no reason for a use of the Ptolemaic approach for construction of the theory of
microcosm phenomena.

Rejecting the quantum principles and using dynamical methods of investigation,
we obtain results, which cannot be obtained by means of the conventional technique,
based on the axiomatic representation of the quantum mechanics. In particular, dy-
namical methods lead to such results: (1) formalization of the procedure of transi-
tion to classical approximation, (2) composite structure of the Dirac particle and (3)
nonrelativistic description of the internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle.
These results cannot be obtained by conventional methods of investigation.

Mistakes in the foundation of a theory are rather speciﬁc. This is not logical,
or mathematical mistakes. These mistakes are associative delusions, where one uses
incorrect associations between our ideas on the properties of the phenomena of the
real world. It is rather diﬃcult to discover the associative delusions. We illustrate
this in the example of discovery of the nonrelativistic character of the Dirac equation.
The Dirac equation can be written in the relativistically covariant form. It is
common practice to think, that it means that the Dirac equation describes rela-
tivistical processes and has the Lorentz symmetry, i.e. the set of all its solutions
is transformed to the same set of solutions at any Lorentz transformation. This
opinion has been existing for many years, and we try to understand the reason of
this viewpoint.

The relativistic character of dynamic equations associates with the representation
of these equations in the relativistically covariant form. However, this association is
valid only at some additional conditions, which are fulﬁlled practically always, and as
a result these conditions are not mentioned usually in the conventional formulation
of the relativistic invariance (compatibility of dynamic equations with the princi-
ples of relativity). Unfortunately, in the case of the Dirac equation these additional
conditions are not fulﬁlled, and the Dirac equation appears to be formally nonrel-
ativistic.
If these
In reality, only internal degrees of freedom are nonrelativistic.
internal degrees of freedom are ignored, the Dirac particle appears to be relativistic.
The additional constraint in the formulation of the relativistical invariance changes
the formulation. The correct formulation looks as follows. Symmetry of dynamic
equations, written in the relativistically covariant form coincides with the symmetry
of their absolute objects [26]. The absolute objects are such quantities, which are
the same for all solutions. Usually such an absolute object is the metric tensor,
which has the form gik =diag
. The group of symmetry of gik is the
1
−
Lorentz group, and the symmetry group of dynamic equations appears to be the
Lorentz group. The Maxwell equations, the Klein-Gordon equation and many other
dynamic equations for real dynamic systems contain only the metric tensor as an
absolute object, and the formulation of relativistical invariance is simpliﬁed. It looks
as follows. The symmetry group of dynamic equations, written in the relativistically
covariant form is the Lorentz group. In such a form it used by most researchers.

The Dirac equation does not contain the metric tensor. Instead it contains the
γ-matrices γi, i = 0, 1, 2, 3. The γ-matrices form a matrix 4-vector, whose symmetry
group is lower, than the Lorentz group. As a result the Dirac equation appears to
have not a symmetry of the Lorentz group.
In other words, the Dirac equation
appears to be nonrelativistic equation.

What physical situation is behind this result? Why does the dynamic equation,
written in the relativistically covariant form, become to be nonrelativistic,
if it
contains an absolute vector? To answer this question, we consider an example of a
charged classical particle, moving in the given electromagnetic ﬁeld F ik.

As far as dynamic equations for both relativistic and nonrelativistic particles can
be written in the noncovariant form and in the relativistically covariant one, it is
clear that the diﬀerence between the relativistic and nonrelativistic descriptions is
not connected with form of dynamic equations. There is anything else, which distin-
guishes the relativistic conception from the nonrelativistic one. It is well known that
the diﬀerence lies in diﬀerent space-time conceptions. In the Newtonian conception
there is an absolute simultaneity and there are two invariant quantities: absolute
time t and absolute space distance r, whereas in the relativistic space-time concep-
tion there exists only one absolute quantity: the space-time interval s = √c2t2

SM. It means, that any system of dynamic equations
ing additional structures in
may be written in the relativistically covariant form, provided the proper absolute
objects (additional structures) are introduced. Thus, to determine, whether the dy-
namic equations are compatible with the principles of relativity, we may write them
in the relativistically covariant form and determine whether or not they contain
absolute objects and what are properties of these absolute objects. If the dynamic
equations contain the constant timelike vector lk, we have nonrelativistic dynamic
system, because lk describes the additional space-time structure, characteristic for
the Newtonian space

Such an approach is convenient in the sense, that it does not contain a refer-
ence to the coordinate system, which is simply a method of description. Relativistic
character of dynamic equation is connected directly with absence of additional space-
time structures in
SM, but not with the relativistically covariant form of the dynamic
equations, because any dynamic equations can be always written in the relativis-
tically covariant form, provided the proper geometrical structure is introduced in
SM . The relativistically covariant dynamic equation is relativistic, provided it does
not contain a reference to some additional structure. However, such a formulation
is unreliable, because the reservation of a reference to additional structure may be

The experimental-ﬁtting style of investigation, applied everywhere, is the main
defect of the contemporary investigation strategy. This style is applied not only in
investigation of concrete physical phenomena of microcosm, where its application
is admissible. It is applied also at construction of the fundamental physical theory,
that is not admissible, because the fundamental physical theory is a systematization
of our knowledge and establishment of logical connection between the fundamental
concepts. The fundamental physical theory is a logical structure, but not a list
of rules, which should be used for explanation experimental data. The list of the
rules may contain the rules, which are contradictory between themselves, but the
statements of a logical structure must not be contradictory.

SM.

Unfortunately, the Newtonian investigation strategy is not used practically, be-
cause it cannot be used, if our fundamental concepts contain mistakes. Some of them

38

were listed in introduction. These mistakes were not actual in the 19th century,
when the microcosm was not investigated, and the Newtonian investigation strat-
egy was dominating. Existence of these mistakes during the 20th century was the
reason, why at the microcosm investigations the Newtonian strategy was replaced
by the experimental-ﬁtting investigation strategy. The last has the advantage, that
it is insensitive to mistakes in the foundation of a physical theory. Following the
experimental-ﬁtting strategy, the researcher of microcosm did not try to ﬁnd mis-
takes of their predecessors. Further more, doubts in results, obtained by great
predecessors were considered to be a bad form, generated by self-conceit. Instead of
searching for mistakes, that was prescribed by the Newtonian strategy, researchers
invented new hypotheses. Three generations of the microcosm researchers were ed-
ucated in ideas of the experimental-ﬁtting strategy. Having investigated the Dirac
equation and obtaining the ﬁrst result, that the Pauli particle is the nonrelativistic
approximation of the Dirac particle, they did not try to carry out the investigation
completely, because the experimental-ﬁtting strategy does not demand this. Why is
it necessary, if the obtained result explains the experimental data? The fact that the
investigation is not complete, and the Dirac particle is a composite particle was not
considered, although such incomplete investigation was incorrect mathematically,
and the mistake could be found at the scrupulous mathematical investigation.

Preconceptions of the experimental-ﬁtting style of thinking are very strong. Even
the author of this paper is not free of them, although he is an adherent of the
Newtonian strategy and tries to use this strategy in his investigations. For instance,
he could not ﬁnd the mistake in the nonrelativistic approximation of the Dirac
equation. He has paid attention on the reduction of the order of the dynamic
system and on the small parameter before the highest derivatives only after he had
discovered, that the Dirac particle was composite. The last result was obtained from
other consideration [2, 25].

The wave function is constructed of potentials. The equations (A.17) does not
contain potentials ξ and Ak, and they cannot be used for description of the ﬂuid
in terms of the wave function. To construct a description in terms of the wave
function, we should not to eliminate potentials ξ from the equations (A.11). Instead,
we should integrate them. The dynamic equations (A.11) may be considered to be
linear partial diﬀerential equations with respect to variables pk. They can be solved

One can test by the direct substitution that the relation (A.19) is the general
solution of linear equations (A.11). Indeed, using (A.12) and the second identity

The action in the form (A.22) is remarkable in the sense, that it contains in-
formation on initial values of the ﬂuid velocities v = j/ρ. Dynamic equations,
generated by the action (A.22), are partial diﬀerential equations, and one needs to
give initial values for variables ϕ, ξ. But initial values for variables ϕ, ξ determine
only labelling of the ﬂuid particles, and they may be chosen universal. For instance,
we may choose for all ﬂuid ﬂows

ϕ (0, x) = ϕin (x) = 0,

ξ (0, x) = ξin (x) = x

(A.23)

42

Then the functions g (ξ) are determined by the initial values of the velocity v (0, x) =
vin (x) in the form [13]

g (ξ) = vin (ξ)

(A.24)

The initial value ρ (0, x) = ρin (x) of the density ρ may be also included in the action
(A.22). It is necessary only to redeﬁne the connection between the quantities jk and
ξ, substituting the relations (A.8) by the relations [13]

where s and ρ are deﬁned by the relations (A.35). One should expect, that the
two-component wave function describes the general case, because the number of
real components of the two-component wave function coincides with the number of
hydrodynamic variables

ρ, j

term containing 3-vector s vanishes. In the special case, when the electromagnetic
potentials Ak = 0, the action (A.36) for
Sst] coincides with the action (2.25) for
[
SS.
Finally, if we choose the arbitrary constant b in the form b = ¯h and set Ak = 0,
we obtain the action (2.1) for the Schr¨odinger particle.

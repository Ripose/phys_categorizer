Abstract

A concrete analysis of the general properties and numerical characteristics of
diﬀerent atomic and nuclear shell systems and subnuclear particles is carried
out on the base of the solution scheme for an introduced in part I physical
graph kinematics which give rise to the two-layer matrix representation of
the structure of any discrete physical microobject within the self-consistent
“graph geometry”. It is given a Riemann’s foundation of the discrete mani-
folds in the inﬁnitesimal and a creation of the discrete quantity notion with
an operation of “count” of “homogeneous elements” (instead of a “measure-
ment” with a scale for the continuous quantity). For “graph microgeometry”
such special consideration in the framework of Heisenberg’s S-matrix parti-
cle formalism leads to the proper “internal geometry” with root trees basis
provided for, in the ﬁrst place, an estimation of all masses of topologically
diﬀerent subnuclear particles.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is noteworthy that the new physical graph kinematics in part I (see Ref. [1]) is applied
to the discrete physical objects and the advantages of this formalism could be shown espe-
cially in case of the topologically diﬀerent discrete microobjects consideration i. e. under
transition to the “microgeometry” or to the space inﬁnitesimal.

1.1 Riemann’s discrete manifolds in the inﬁnitesimal
and the “graph geometry”.

According to the classical Riemann’s work of 1868 “ ¨Uber die Hypothesen, welche der
Geometrie zu Grunde liegen” (Ref. [2]) the metric relations principle is contained already in
the discrete manifold (die Mannigfaltigkeit) notion itself and from the quantitative point of
view a comparison of separate parts of the discrete manifolds is carried through the “count”
of homogeneous elements (for the continuous manifolds — by means of the “measurement”

1

with a scale). Under transition to the space inﬁnitesimal the metric relations in the “micro-
geometry”, as it is concluded in [2], are not explained by usual geometrical admissions and
the discrete quantities itself have to form straightforwardly the discrete manifold.

A main diﬃculty at the creation of a notion of any discrete mathematical or physical
quantity consists therefore in the appropriate choice of some general notion with a set of the
diﬀerent “states” or “determination modes” (die Bestimmungsweise) which must precede the
creation of the discrete quantity notion. However within the framework of the considered
graph kinematics as a such set of the diﬀerent “states” or “determination modes” appears
just a set of the diﬀerent root v-trees (counting homogeneous elements) into the microobject
“internal geometry”. Thus the “internal geometry” of microobjects become structural and
thereby it is realized the self-consistent “graph geometry”, in particular with the quantitative
characteristics — the deﬁnite numbers of “discrete” root v-trees.

Very such alternative way of an introduction of the postulated by Riemann discrete
manifolds was supported by Poincar´e in due time (see Einstein paper “Nichteuklidische
Geometrie in der Physik” (Ref. [3])) but the further development had stopped apparently
because of an absence of the suitable “counting homogeneous elements” for the realization
of “internal geometry” corresponding to the discrete physical objects. Nevertheless there is
a good reason now to believe that we could have the enough simple and adequate method
of microobjects structure representation in the frame of the “graph geometry” i. e. beyond
the conventional space-time.

It is necessarily to keep in view that the basic ways of fundamental investigations of
the continuous manifolds with well-known arbitrariness in the choice of metric and the
various procedures of “measurements” are responsible all over for the mainstream of physical
research.

In this connection it is expediently to mark that we have as a rule the diﬀerent “dimetrics”
where an initial element is the unit square what allows to introduce an imaginary unity “i”
and a corresponding spectrum of numbers. However in the case of the possible “trimetrics”
where an initial element is the unit volume we have a new spectrum of numbers without
an imaginary unity “i” (for such uncommon “trimetric” there exists a speciﬁc equality
33+43+53=63 analogous to the “Egyptian triangle” equality 32+42=52). Further we may
have the diﬀerent “tetrametrics” and so on.

2 TWO-LAYER MATRIX SCHEME
IN THE GRAPH KINEMATICS

In part I (see Ref. [1]) it is carried out a study of the solution scheme for an intro-
duced physical graph kinematics which give rise to the two-layer matrix presentation of
the structure and the scattering experiment of an arbitrary physical microobject within the
framework of the self-consistent “graph geometry”. Below we reproduce the typical exam-
ples of the application of this scheme to the simple macro- and microobjects as a starting
point for the following analysis.

2.1 Two-layer matrix description
of the electric networks

The use of two fundamental linear Kirchhoﬀ’s laws [4] for ﬁnding of the branch (wire)
currents J of an electric network as a some macroobject leads directly to the formation of
two-layer, depending on the resistances ω, square matrix

[7]) and the independent loop matrix

For a concrete network’s graph, for example in the case of the full graph K4 with v =
v
2 (cid:17) = 6, there exists as a reference frame the set of 16 skeleton (v = 4, n =
with non-

4, n = (cid:16)
3) — trees corresponding to (3 × 3)-submatrices of the incidence matrix I (ǫ)

zero determinants. This set of skeleton (v = 4, n = 3) — trees constructs the form of
denominator and numerators of the resulting solution J (ω, E) (E — electromotive forces).

2.2 Two-layer matrix approximation
in the physical graph kinematics

In the case of a possible transition from the initial S-matrix theory of Heisenberg [5] with
Feynman integrals and corresponding Feynman diagrams to the physical graph kinematics
formalism, for microobjects already, one takes place also the application of two-layer matrix
approximation with the analogous construction of square matrix of (1) type. This approx-
imation allows to determine the graph internal 4-momenta q on the mass shell (q2 = m2)
by means of the adequate linear conditions of an “extremal equilibrium” in all vertices and
along independent loops of the physical graph with corresponding square matrix

the discrete stable physical microobjects) includes the non-zero determinants in denominator
and numerators which are responded to the set of appropriate root trees.

In the next two sections the above-described physical graph kinematics with two-layer
matrices and root trees basis is extended to a concrete analysis of the general properties of
diﬀerent atomic, nuclear and subnuclear microobjects.

3 ROOT TREES REPRESENTATION OF THE ATOMIC
AND NUCLEAR SYSTEMS

The essential characteristics of the atomic and nuclear shell systems in the ﬁrst iteration
at least are to be extracted from the main properties of the root v-trees. As it being known
already according to the Table 1 of part I (Ref.
[1]) for this task is to be considered the
following interval:

1 6 Tv 6 115 (1 < v 6 8).

(3)

Here is omitted the value v = 1 as a trivial case corresponding to an isolate vertex and
we begin an investigation of the root trees sequence in the indicated interval (3) with v =
2, Tv=2 = 1 which is responsible to the primary “core” of an atomic or nuclear shell system
(including possibly the spin in a given graph description). Such “core” is an elementary root
tree with one “free” — terminal — vertex vF = 1 (deg (vF ) = 1) or a representation of the
initial simplest physical microobject.

Further, by the suggesting graph approximation — planned in 2.2 — for the atomic and
nuclear shell systems and taking into account the excluded “core” vertex (or vertices) we
can identify the number of lines — “edges” — for any root v-tree, equal to v − 1, with the
principal quantum number (QN) plus 1 (one “core” vertex here for the root tree in the form
of a path or a simple trail from the root vertex)

v − 1 = nQN + 1.

Indeed, more exactly, if we denote through (vR) — the root vertex and through d (vR, vF ) —
the distances between the single root vertex (vR) and the diﬀerent “free” vertices (vF ) (with
deg (vF ) = 1) it is naturally to make the following evident assumption for the values of
principal QN

nQN = dmax(vR, v◦

F ) − 1 = v − 2

and as usually the possible values for the orbital QN

lQN : 0, 1, . . . , (nQN − 2)(nQN − 1)

(4)

(4′)

what corresponds to the number of “free” vertices (vF ) with lower values of d (vR, vF ) but
without of the “core” vertices (vc

F ) with d (vR, vc

F ) = 1.

Thus according to (4) the principal QN is responsible for one root v-tree from the full
set — Tv — of the root v-trees; namely, this root v-tree has the form of a path (simple
trail) from the root vertex (vR) with the maximum distance dmax(vR, v◦
F ) to a single “free”
vertex denoted through (v◦
F ) : v◦
F = 1; the latter is responsible for lQN = 0 at a given
nQN . To the “core” vertices (vc), including “free” vertices (vc
F ), belong all vertices with

4

minimum distance d (vR, vc) = 1 from the root vertex; these vertices are unconnected with
the representation of various QN for shell systems. At last the “free” vertices (vF ) with the
intermediate distances from the root vertex (vR)

1 < d (vR, vF ) < dmax(vR, v◦
F )

are responsible for the rest values of lQN > 0 from (4′). However in connection with the
above-stated graph approximation model it is reasonable to note that beginning from v >
5 (nQN > 3) the set of “free” vertices (vF ) of a concrete root tree, of course with d (vR, vF ) <
dmax(vR, v◦

F ) = v − 1, may be associated at the same values of lQN from (4′).

Table 1 below includes, in agreement with an “extremal equilibrium” consideration in
subsection 2.2 (stable systems), the rules of a ﬁlling of the electron shells in atoms (2n2
QN ) and
the nucleon shells in nuclei (magic numbers for protons) in comparison with the parameters
of root trees scheme (v, and in a hidden form

vR, vF , v◦

F , vc, . . . , dmax(vR, v◦

F ), d (vR, vF ),

etc.) or straight with the root v-trees numbers (Tv):

4 ROOT TREES EVALUATION OF THE SUBNUCLEAR
MICROOBJECT MASSES

It was shown in part I (see Ref. [1]) that a number of the root v-trees Tv is to satisfy to

the next inequalities for any v > 1

For the sake of a graph description of the quasi-doublet or quasi-triplet physical microob-
ject constitution it is necessary to produce from (5) the following chain of the recurrent
inequalities

Tv+1 > 2Tv, Tv+1 < 3Tv.

Tv > 2rTv−r, Tv < 3sTv−s

(5)

(6)

where r, s = 1, 2, 3, . . . and so on, what allows to compile the Table 2 (see below) for
comparison of Tv values at v > 9 and their “double- and triple-splitting fragments” with the
experimental masses of appropriate subnuclear microobjects (part I (Ref. [1]) contains only
two illustrative examples).

Table 2. The fractional “fragments” of the root trees numbers Tv (v is the number
of vertices) in comparison with the experimental masses of “suitable” X — microobjects

It is easy to examine that in a given iteration (an average error ranges 0 to 10 per cent)
factually all subnuclear masses from [6] are presented in Table 2 (everywhere in Table 2, in
[7], number of vertices p identical to v). The root trees numbers or
accordance with Ref.
its fractional “fragments” are ﬁtted with indicated precision to experimental values of all
known particle masses. At the same time there take place the “mixing” of meson and baryon
particle categories and the “concentration” of particle masses within an interval v=9÷14.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The above-developed, in section 2, two-layer matrix method for the study and adequate
description of any discrete microobject based on the strongly derived from an incidence
matrix I (ǫ)
(upper layer) natural “graph microgeometry”, generally unique for every
(v−1×n)

concrete microobject, allows to refuse from the common space-time treatment owing to the
appearance of an equivalent, to a certain degree, graph language (a “third language”). On
the other hand, as it was demonstrated earlier, the resulting solutions of the most equations
of the contemporary ﬁeld theory after the corresponding mathematical “contractions”, in
the direction to the particle — like solutions with a cardinal decrease of degrees of freedom,
could be represented as the systems of suitable diagrams or graphs (of diﬀerent types and
interpretations). Therefore due to Riemann’s general conception for the discrete manifolds
(see Ref. [2]) and Kirchhoﬀ’s method of skeleton trees for an electric network (see Ref. [4])
we should analyse any micro as well as macro discrete physical objects within their proper
natural “graph geometry” beyond space-time. In addition it is important to emphasize that
the “graph geometry” must be generated straightforwardly from the discrete physical object
characteristics and probably for this reason it cann’t serve as a frame for physical reality in
the form of theoretical or experimental data as opposed to the continuous physical models
with “external geometry”.

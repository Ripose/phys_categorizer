Abstract

It was generally believed throughout the 20-th century that irreversibility is a purely
classical event without operator counterpart. However, a classical irreversible system
cannot be consistently decomposed into a ﬁnite number of reversible quantum particles
(and, vice versa), thus establishing that the origin of irreversibility is basically unknown
at the dawn of the 21-th century. To resolve this problem, we adopt the historical an-
alytic representation of irreversibility by Lagrange and Hamilton with external terms
in their analytic equations; we show that, when properly written, the brackets of the
time evolution characterize covering Lie-admissible algebras; we show that the for-
malism has a fully consistent operator counterpart given by the Lie-admissible branch
of hadronic mechanics; we identify catastrophic mathematical and physical inconsis-
tencies when irreversible formulations are treated with the conventional mathematics
used for reversible systems; and show that, when the dynamical equations are treated
with a novel irreversible mathematics, Lie-admissible formulations are fully consistent
because invariant at both the classical and operator level. The case of closed-isolated
systems verifying conventional total conservation laws, yet possessing an irreversible
structure, is treated via the Lie-isotopic subclass of Lie-admissible formulations. The
analysis is conducted for both matter and antimatter at the classical and operator
levels to prevent insidious inconskistenmcies occurring for the sole study of matter or,
separately, antimatter, as known known for the problem of grand uniﬁcationsr.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Scientiﬁc Imbalance Caused by Irreversibility. As it is well known, rather
vast studies have been conducted in the 20-th century in attempting a reconciliation of
the manifest irreversibility in time of our macroscopic environment with the reversibility of
quantum mechanics, resulting in the rather widespread belief that irreversibility solely exists
at the macroscopic level because it ”disappears” at quantum mechanical level (see, e.g., the
reprint volume by Shoeber and vast literature quoted therein).

The above belief created a large scientiﬁc imbalance because irreversible systems were
treated with the mathematical and physical formulations developed for reversible systems.
Since these formulations are themselves reversible, the attempt in salvaging quantum me-
chanics vis a vis the irreversibility of physical reality caused serious limitations in virtually
all quantitative sciences.

The imbalance originated from the fact that all used formulations were of Hamiltonian
type (i.e., the formulations are entirely characterized by the sole knowledge of the Hamil-
tonian), under the awareness that all known Hamiltonians are reversible because all known
potentials (such as the Coulomb potential V (r) = q1q2

r ) are reversible).

The academic belief of the purely classical character of irreversibility was disproved in
1985 by Santilli [2] via the following theorem whose proof is instructive for serious scholars
in the ﬁeld

THEOREM 1.1: A classical irreversible system cannot be consistently reduced to a ﬁnite
number of quantum particles all in reversible conditions and, vice versa, a ﬁnite ensemble
of quantum particles all in reversible conditions cannot consistently reproduce an irreversible
macroscopic system under the correspondence or other principles.

The implications of the above theorem are rather deep because the theorem establishes
that, rather than adapting to quantum mechanics all possible physical events in the universe,
it is necessary to seek a covering of quantum mechanics permitting a consistent treatment
of elementary particles in irreversible conditions, where the notion of covering is intended
to be such that, when irreversibility is removed, quantum mechanics is recovered identically
and uniquely.

In the ﬁnal analysis, the orbit of an electron in an atomic structure is indeed reversible
in time, with consequential validity of quantum mechanics. However, the idea that the same
electron has an equally reversible orbit when moving in the core of a star is repugnant to
reason as well as scientiﬁc vigour because, e.g., said idea would imply that the electron has
to orbit in the core of a star with a locally conserved angular momentum (from the basic
rotational symmetry of all Hamiltonians), with consequential direct belief of the existence
of the perpetual motion within physical media.

In short, contrary to a popular belief of the 20-th century, Theorem 1.1 establishes that
irreversibility originates at the most primitive levels of nature, that of elementary particles,
and then propagates all the way to our macroscopic environment.

In this paper, we complete studies in the origin of irreversibility initiated by the author
during his graduate studies in physics at the University of Torino, Italy, in the late 1960s
[7-9], and continued at Harvard University under DOE support in the late l970s [6,11,12],
which studies achieved mathematical and physical consistency only recently. The decades
required by the completion of the research is an indication of the complexity of the problem.
In fact, it was relativity easy to identify since the early eﬀorts irreversible generalizations
of Heisenberg’s equations [7-9]. However, these generalized equations subsequently resulted
to lack invariance, here intended as the capability by quantum mechanics of predicting the
same numerical values for the same conditions but under the time evolution of the theory.
In turn, the achievement of invariance predictably required the laborious prior eﬀort
of identifying a new irreversible mathematics, namely, a new mathematics speciﬁcally con-
structed for the invariant treatment of irreversible systems while being a covering of con-
ventional mathematics in the above indicated sense. Following the achievement of the new
mathematics, the resolution of the scientiﬁc imbalance of the 20-th century caused by irre-
versibility was direct and immediate.

By looking in retrospective, rather than being demeaning for quantum mechanics, the
search for its invariant irreversible covering has brought into full light the majestic axiomatic

2

consistency of quantum mechanics, and how diﬃcult resulted to be the preservation of the
same axiomatic consistency at the covering irreversible level.

In other words, only art masterpieces, such as Michelangelo’s La Piet´a, are eternal. By
comparison, quantitative sciences will never admit ﬁnal theories because, no matter how
majestic a given theory may appear at a given time, its surpassing by a broader theory for
more complex physical conditions is only a matter of time.

As we shall see, the studies presented in this paper required several preceding contribu-
tions over an extended period of time, although their coordination for the invariant treatment
of irreversibility is presented in this paper for the ﬁrst time. A comprehensive presentation
of these studies will appear in monographs [18c] following the publication of this paper.

1.2 The Forgotten Legacy of Newton, Lagrange and Hamilton. The scientiﬁc im-
balance on irreversibility was created in the early part of the 20-th century when, to achieve
compatibility with quantum mechanics and special relativity, the entire universe was re-
duced to potential forces and the analytic equations were “truncated” with the removal of
the external terms.

In reality, Newton [3] did not propose his celebrated equations to be restricted to reversible
forces derivable from a potential F = ∂V /∂r, but proposed them for the most general possible
irreversible systems,

ma ×

= Fka(t, r, v), k = 1, 2, 3; a = 1, 2, . . . , N,

(1.1)

dvka
dt

where the conventional associative product of numbers, matrices, operators, etc., is denoted
hereon with the symbol × so as to distinguish it from numerous other products needed later
on.

Similarly, to be compatible with Newton’s equations, Lagrange [4] and Hamilton [5]
decomposed Newton’s force into a potential and a nonpotential component, represented
all potential forces with functions today known as the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian,
and represented nonpotential forces with external terms. Therefore the true Lagrange and
Hamilton equations are given, respectively, by

d

(1.2d)

The analytic equations used throughtout the 20-th century, those without external terms,
shall be referred to as the truncated Lagrange and Hamilton equations.

More recently, Santilli [6a] conducted comprehensive studies on the integrability condi-
tions for the existence of a potential, or a Lagrangian, or a Hamiltonian, called conditions
of variational selfadjointness. These study permit the rigorous decomposition of Newtonian

(NSA),

Consequently, the true Lagrange and Hamilton equations can be more technically written

(1.4b)

The forgotten legacy of Newton, Lagrange and Hamilton is that irreversibility originates
precisely in the truncated external terms, because all known potential-SA forces are re-
versible. The scientiﬁc imbalance of Section 1.1 is then due to the fact that no serious
scientiﬁc study on irreversibility can be conducted with the truncated analytic equations
and their operator counterpart, since these equations can only represent reversible systems.
Being born and educated in Italy, during his graduate studies the author had the op-
portunity of reading in the late 1960s the original works by Lagrange that were written in
Torino (where this paper has beeen written) and mostly in Italian.

In this way, the author had the opportunity of verifying Lagrange’s analytic vision of
representing irreversibility precisely via the external terms, due to the impossibility of rep-
resenting all possible physical events via the sole use of the Lagrangian, since the latter was
conceived for the representation of reversible and potential events. As the reader can verify,
Hamilton had, independently, the same vision.

Consequently, the truncation of the analytic equations caused the impossibility of a
credible treatment of irreversibility at the purely classical level. The lack of a credible
treatment of irreversibility then propagated at the subsequent quantum mechanical and
quantum ﬁeld theoretical levels.

It then follows that quantum mechanics cannot possibly be used for serious studies on ir-
reversibility because the discipline was constructed for the description of reversible quantized
atomic orbits and not for irreversible systems.

While the validity of quantum mechanics for the arena of its original conception and
construction is beyond scientiﬁc doubt, the assumption of quantum mechanics as the ﬁnal
operator theory for all conditions existing in the universe, such as orbits of particles in the
core of a star, is outside the boundaries of serious science.

This establishes the need for the construction of a covering of quantum mechanics specif-

ically conceived and constructed for quantitative treatments of irreversible systems.

1.3 Early Representations of Irreversible Systems. As it is well known, the brackets
of the time evolution of the truncated analytic equations, the familiar Poisson brackets,
characterize a Lie algebra, a feature that persists at the quantum level, thus establishing Lie
algebras as the ultimate foundations of the physics of the 20-th century.

By contrast, the brackets of the time evolution of an observable A(r, p) in phase space

according to the analytic equations with external terms,

dA

= (A, H, F ) =

cannot characterize any algebra as commonly understood in mathematics, because the brack-
ets violate the right associative and scalar laws.

Therefore, the presence of external terms in the analytic equations causes not only the
loss of all Lie algebras in the study of irreversibility, but actually the loss of all possible
algebras.

To resolve this problem, the author initiated a long scientiﬁc journey following the reading

of Lagrange’s papers.

The original argument [7-9], still valid today, is to select analytic equations characterizing

brackets in the time evolution that verify the following conditions:

(1) Said brackets must verify the right and left associative and scalar laws to characterize

an algebra;

(2) Said brackets must not be invariant under time reversal as a necessary condition to

represent irreversibility ab initio; and

(3) The underlying algebras must be a covering of Lie algebras as a necessary condition
to characterize a covering of the truncated analytic equations, namely, as a condition for the
selected representation of irreversibility to admit reversibility as a particular case.

Condition (1) requires that said brackets should be bilinear, e.g., of the form (A, B) with

basic algebraic axioms

(n × A, B) = n × (A, B),

(A, m × B) = m × (A, B); n, m ∈ C,

(1.6a)

(A × B, C) = A × (B, C),

(A, B × C) = (A, B) × C.

(1.6b)

Condition (2) can be ﬁrst realized by requiring that brackets (A, B) are not totally antisym-
metric as the conventional Poisson brackets,

(A, B) 6= −(B, A),

(1.7)

because time reversal is realized via the use of Hermitean conjugation.

Condition (3) implies that brackets (A, B) characterize Lie-admissible algebras in the
sense of Albert [10], with operator form resulting to be also Jordan-admissible according to
the following

DEFINITION 1.1: A generally nonassociative algebra U with elements a, b, c, . . . and
abstract product ab is said to be Lie-admissible when the attached algebra U − characterized
by the same vector space U equipped with the product [a, b] = ab − ba veriﬁes the Lie axioms

Said generally nonassociative algebra U is said to be Jordan-admissible when the attached
algebra U + characterized by the vector space U equipped with the product {a, b} = ab + ba
veriﬁes the Jordan axioms

[a, b] = −[b, a],

[[a, b], c] + [[b, c], a] + [[c, b], a] = 0.

{a, b} = {b, a},
{{a, b}, a2} = {a, {b, a2}}.

5

(1.8a)

(1.8b)

(1.9a)

(1.9b)

In essence, the condition of Lie-admissibility requires that the brackets (A, B) contain a
totally antisymmetric component with a residual totally symmetric part, thus admitting the
decomposition

(A, B) = [A, B]∗ + {A, B}∗.

(1.10)

where the ∗ denotes expected generalizationms of conventional brackets.

The antisymmetric brackets [A, B]∗ generally result to be Lie at both classical and oper-
ator levels. However, as illustrated below, for reasons yet unknown the symmetric brackets
{A, B}∗ always verify Jordan’s ﬁrst axiom (1.9a), but they generally violate the second axiom
(1.9b) in their classical form and verify it only in their operator form.

After identifying the above lines, Santilli [9] proposed in 1967 the following generalized

analytic equations

drk

dt

= α ×

∂H(t, r, p)
∂pak

,

dpak

∂H(t, r, p)

(where α and β are real non-null parameters) that are manifestly irreversible. The time
evolution is then given by

∂H

− β ×

∂H

,

(1.11)

(1.12)

whose brackets are manifestly Lie-admissible because the attached antisymmetric brackets
are proportional to the conventional Poisson brackets,

[A, B]∗ = (A, B) − (B, A) = (α + β) × (

∂A
∂rk
a

×

∂H

−

∂H

).

(1.13)

However, the attached symmetric brackets

[A, B]∗ = (A, B) + (B, A) = (α − β) × (

∂A

∂H

second axiom (1.9b) as the reader is encouraged to verify.

(1.15)

Also in 1967, Santilli [7,8] proposed an operator counterpart of the preceding classical
setting consisting in the ﬁrst known Lie-admissible parametric generalization of Heisenberg’s
equation in the following inﬁnitesimal and ﬁnite forms

i ×

= (A, B) = p × A × H − q × H × A =

dA
dt

= m × (A × B − B × A) + n × (A × B + B × A),

(1.16a)

(1.16b)

(1.16c)

(1.17)

(1.18)

A(t) = W (t) × A(0) × W †(t) = ei×H×q×t × A(0) × e−i×t×p×H,
W × W † 6= I.

where p, q, p ± q are non-null parameters, and

m = p + q, n = q − p,

Brackets (A, B) are manifestly Lie-admissible with attached antisymmetric part

[A, B]∗ = (A, B) − (B, A) = (p − q) × [A, B].

The same brackets are also Jordan-admissible as interested readers are encouraged to verify,
thus illustrating the peculiar occurrence whereby symmetric brackets that are apparently
similar are Jordan admissible only at the operator level.

Despite this limitation, the Jordan-admissibility of the operator brackets establishes Jor-
dan’s dream on the physical applications of his algebras, although the latter occur for ir-
reversible systems. As a matter of fact, the above Jordan-admissibility establishes the im-
possibility for Jordan algebras to have applications at the purely quAntum level, due to its
purely reversible, thus Lie character.

The time evolution of Eqs. (1.16) is manifestly irreversible (for p 6= q) with nonconser-

vation of the energy

dH
dt

i ×

= (H, H) = (p − q) × H × H 6= 0.

(1.19)

Subsequent to papers [7-9], Santilli realized that the above formulations are not invariant

under their own time evolution because Eq. (1.16b) is manifestly nonunitary.

The application of nonunitary transforms to time evolution (1.16) then led to the proposal
in memoir [11,12] of 1978 of the following Lie-admissible operator generalization of Heisenberg
equations in the following inﬁnitesimal and ﬁnite forms

i ×

= A < H − H > A = A × R × H − H × S × A = (A, H)∗,

(1.20a)

dA
dt

A(t) = W (t) × A(0) × W †(t) = (ei×H×S×t) × A(0) × (e−i×t×R×H ), W × W † 6= I, (1.20b)
R = R(t, r, p, ψ, ∂ψ, ...) = S†.

(1.20c)

where R, S and R ± S are now nonsingular operators (or matrices), and Eq. (1.20c) is a
basic consistency condition explained later on.

Eqs. (1.20) are the fundamental equations of hadronic mechanics 12,18]. Their basic

brackets are manifestly Lie-admissible and Jordan admissible with structure

(A, B)∗ = A < B − B > A = A × R × B − B × S × A =

= (A × T × B − B × T × A) + (A × Q × B + B × Q × A),

T = R + S, T = S − R.

The generalized classical equations proposed in Refs. [11,12] jointly with Eqs. [1.20] are

given in uniﬁed phase space notation by

(1.21a)

(1.21b)

(1.22a)

∂H(b)
∂bν

,

7

b = (bµ) = (rk, pk), µ = 1, 2, ..., 6 k = 1, 2, 3,

(1.22b)

where the tensor Sµν is Lie-admissible (but not jointly Jordan admissible), namely, the

attached antisymmetric tensor

Ωµν = Sµν − Sνµ,

characterizes Birkhoﬀ’a equations (see monograph [6b] for comprehensive studies), with
solution

(1.23)

(1.24)

Sµν =

∂Rν(t, b)
∂bµ

, Sµν = [(Sαβ)−1]µν.

The canonical particular case is recovered for the value R = (Rµ) = (pk, 0) as the reader is
encouraged to verify [6b,11].

It is easy to see that the application of a nonunitary transform to the parametric equations
(1.16) leads to the operator equations (1.20) and that the application of additional nonunitary
transforms preserves their Lie-admissible and Jordan-admissible characters.

Consequently, fundamental equations (1.20) are “directly universal” in the sense of admit-
ting as particular cases all possible brackets characterizing an algebra (universality) without
the use of the transformation theory (direct universality).

1.4 Catastrophic Inconsistencies of Early Irreversible Formulations. Despite their
direct universality, Eqs. (1.20) are not invariant under their own time evolution and, con-
sequently, are aﬄicted by catastrophic inconsistencies [29-37].

To clarify this crucial point, let us recall that the capability by quantum mechanics to
predict the same numerical values under the same conditions at diﬀerent times is given by
the unitary character of Heisenberg’s time evolution for Hermitean Hamiltonians,

A(t) = U(t) × A(0) × U † = (ei×H×t) × A(0) × (e−i×t×H),

U × U † = U † × U = I, H = H †,

that characterizes the following type of invariance of the Lie brackets,

U × [A, B] × U † = A′ × B′ − B′ × A′ = [A′, B′],

A′ = U × A × U †, B′ = U × B × U †.

namely, an invariance speciﬁcally referred to the preservation of the conventional associative
product, ×′ ≡ ×.

For the case of the broader Lie-admissible equatsions (1.20) the situation is diﬀerent
because the Hamiltonian remains Hermitean, but the time evolution is nonunitary, in which
case the application of the time evolution leads to the new brackets

W × (A, B)∗ × W † = A′ <′ B′ − B′ >′ A′ = A′ × R′ × B′ − B′ × S′ × S′ × A′ =

= A′ × (W †−1 × R × W −1) × B′ − B′ × (W †−1 × R × W −1) × A′ = (A′, B′)∗′,

W × W † 6= I, H = H †,

namely, the transformed product remains Lie-admissible due to its direct universality, but
the product itself is altered, R → R′ 6= R, S → S′ 6= S.

As we shall see in Section 4, diﬀerent values of the R and S operators characterize diﬀerent
physical systems. Consequently, the above change of values of the R and S operators caused
by the time evolution of the theory cannot preserve numerical predictions in time.

It is instructive to verify that essentially the same occurrences hold for the classical

Lie-admissible equations [11] due to the noncanonical character of the time evolution.

Without proof we, therefore, quote the following:

THEOREM 1.2 [29]: Whether Lie or Lie-admissible, all classical theories possessing
noncanonical time evolutions are aﬄicted by catastrophic mathematical and physical incon-
sistencies.

THEOREM 1.3 [29]: ): All operator theories possessing a nonunitary time evolution
formulated on conventional Hilbert spaces H over conventional ﬁelds of complex numbers C
are aﬄicted by catastrophic mathematical and physical inconsistencies. In particular, said
nonunitary theories

1) do not possess invariant units of time, space, energy, etc., thus lacking physically

meaningful application to measurements;

2) do not conserve Hermiticity in time, thus lacking physically meaningful observables;
3) do not possess unique and invariant numerical predictions;
4) generally violate probability and causality laws; and
5) violate the basic axioms of Galileo’s and Einstein’s relativities.

A comprehensive presentation of the above inconsistency theorems is available in Chapter
1 of monograph [18c]. For the limited scope of this paper it is suﬃcient to indicate that
the mathematical inconsistencies are rather serious. All mathematical formulations used
in physics are based on ﬁelds that, in turn, are centrally dependent on the basic unit.
However, noncanonical or nonunitary transformations do not preserve the basic unit by
central assumption.

Hence, a given ﬁeld at the initial time is no longer applicable at a subsequent time for
all noncanonical or nonunitary theories, due to the lack of time invariance of the basic unit.
In turn, the loss under the time evolution of the base ﬁeld causes the catastrophic collapse
of all mathematical formulations.

For example, the formulation of a noncanonical classical theory on the Euclidean space
E over the ﬁeld of Real numbers R, or of a nonunitary operator theory on a Hilbert space H
over the ﬁeld of complex numbers C has no mathematical consistency, again, because of the
lack of invariance of the basic unit of the ﬁelds (and, hence, of the ﬁeld themselves) under
the time evolution.

Conventional mathematics can at best be used for the treatment of noncanonical or
nonunitary theories for the representation of systems at a ﬁxed value of time without any
possible dynamics. In this case no irreversibility can be consistently treated due to the need
of a time evolution for its very manifestation.

The physical inconsistencies are equally catastrophic, as illustrated by occurrences 1) to
[29] for details). It is suﬃcient here to recall that the basic
5) of Theorem 1.3 (see Ref.
unit of the three-dimensional Euclidean space I = Diag.(1, 1, 1) represents in an abstract
dimensionless form the assumed measurement units, e.g., I = Diag.(1cm, 1cm, cm). The

9

loss of the measurement units under the time evolution then illustrates the catastrophic
character of the inconsistencies due, e.g., to the consequential lack of invariant numerical
predictions.

Similarly, it is easy to prove that the condition of Hermiticity at the initial time,

(hφ| × H †) × |ψi ≡ hφ| × (H × |ψi), H = H †,

(1.28)

is violated at subsequent times for theories with nonunitary time evolution when formulated
on H over C. This additional catastrophic inconsistency (known as Lopez’s lemma [31-32]),
can be expressed by

[hψ| × W † × (W × W †)−1 × W × H × W †] × W |ψi =

= hψ| × W † × [(W × H × W †) × (W × W †)−1 × W × |ψi] =
= (h ˆψ × T × H ′†) × | ˆψi = h ˆψ| × ( ˆH × T × | ˆψi),
| ˆψi = W ×|ψi, T = (W ×W †)−1 = T †,
H ′† = T −1× ˆH ×T 6= H.

(1.29a)

(1.292b)

(1.29c)

As a result, nonunitary theories treated with conventional mathematics do not admit phys-
ically meaningful observables.

Perhaps more insidious is the catastrophic inconsistency caused by the general violation
of causality by theories with nonunitary time evolutions since, the veriﬁcation of causality
laws by quantum mechanics is deeply linked to the unitarity of its time evolution, as well
known.

By no means the above catastrophic inconsistencies solely apply to Santilli’s early for-
mulations of irreversibility. In fact, due to the ”direct universality” of theories (1.20), the
same inconsistencies apply to a rather vast number of theories, such:

1) Dissipative nuclear theories [25] represented via an imaginary potential in non-Hermitean

Hamiltonians,

H = H0 = iV 6= H †

(1.30)

lose all algebras in the brackets of their time evolution (requiring a bilinear product) in favor
of the triple system,

i × dA/dt = A × H − H † × A = [A, H, H †]

(1.31)

This causes the loss of nuclear notions such as “protons and neutrons” as conventionally
understood, e.g., because the deﬁnition of their spin mandates the presence of a consistent
algebra in the brackets of the time evolution.

2) Statistical theories with an external collision term C (see Ref.

[38] and literature

quoted therein) and equation of the density

i dρ/dt = ρ ⊙ H = [ρ, H] + C, H = H †,

(1.32)

violate the conditions for the product ρ ⊙ H to characterize any algebra, as well as the exis-
tence of exponentiation to a ﬁnite transform, let alone violating the conditions of unitarity.

3) The so-called “q-deformations” of the Lie product (see, e.g., [39-44] and very large

literature quoted therein)

A × B − q × B × A,

(1.33)

where q is a non-null scalar, that are a trivial particular case of Santilli’s (p, q)-deformations
(1.11) introduced in 1967 [7].

4) The so-called “k-deformations” [45-48] that are a relativistic version of the q-deforma-

tions, thus also being a particular case of general structures (1.4.42).

5) The so-called “star deformations” [49] of the associative product

where T is ﬁxed, and related generalized Lie product

A ⋆ B = A × T × B,

A ⋆ B − B ⋆ A,

(1.34)

(1.35)

are manifestly nonunitary and coincide with Santilli’s Lie-isotopic algebras introduced in
1978 [11,12].

are an evident particular case of Santilli’s Lie-admissible product (1.4.46) with T = W = I.
11) String theories (see ref. [37] and literature quoted therein) generally have a noncanon-
ical structure due to the inclusion of gravitation with additional catastrophic inconsistencies
when including supersymmetries.

12) The so-called squeezed states theories [58,59] due to their manifest nonunitary char-

acter.

13) All quantum groups (see, e.g., refs. [60-62]) with a nonunitary structure.
14) Kac-Moody superalgebras [63] are also nonunitary and a particular case of Santilli’s

Lie-admissible algebra (1.20) with T = I and Q a phase factor.

Numerous additional theories are also aﬄicted by the catastrophic inconsistencies of
Theorem 1.3, such as quantum groups, quantum gravity, and other theories with nonunitary
time evolution formulated on conventional Hilbert spaces over conventional ﬁelds the reader
can easily identify in the literature.

All the above theories have a nonunitary structure formulated via conventional mathe-
matics and, therefore, are aﬄicted by the catastrophic mathematical and physical inconsis-
tencies of Theorem 1.3.

Additional generalized theories were attempted via the relaxation of the linear character
of quantum mechanics [35]. These theories are essentially based on eigenvalue equations
with the structure

H(t, r, p, |ψi) × |ψi = E × |ψi,

(1.37)

11

(i.e., H depends on the wavefunction).

Even though mathematically intriguing and possessing a seemingly unitary time evolu-
tion, these theories also possess rather serious physical drawbacks, such as: they violate
the superposition principle necessary for composite systems such as a hadron; they violate
the fundamental Mackay imprimitivity theorem necessary for the applicability of Galileo’s
and Einstein’s relativities and possess other drawbacks [18b] so serious to prevent consistent
applications.

Yet another type of broader theory is Weinberg’s nonlinear theory [64] with brackets of

the type

A ⊙ B − B ⊙ A =

=

∂A
∂ψ

×

∂B
∂ψ† −

∂B
∂ψ

×

∂A
∂ψ† ,

(1.38)

where the product A ⊙ B is nonassociative.

This theory violates Okubo’s No-Quantization Theorem [30], prohibiting the use of nonas-
sociative envelopes because of catastrophic physical consequences, such as the loss of equiv-
alence between the Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg representations (the former remains associa-
tive, while the latter becomes nonassociative, thus resulting in inequivalence).

Weinberg’s theory also suﬀers from the absence of any unit at all, with consequential
inability to apply the theory to measurements, the loss of exponentiation to a ﬁnite transform
(lack of Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem), and other inconsistencies studied in Ref. [11].

These inconsistencies are not resolved by the adaptation of Weinberg’s theory proposed
by Jordan [65] as readers seriously interested in avoiding the publication of theories known
to be inconsistent ab initio are encouraged to verify.

In conclusion, by the late 1970’s Santilli had identiﬁed classical and operator generalized
theories [11,12] that were proved to be directly universal and include as trivial particular
cases a plethora of simpler versions by various other authors.

However, all these theories subsequently resulted in being catastrophically inconsistent
on mathematical and physical grounds because they are noninvariant under their time evo-
lution when elaborated with conventional mathematics, thus mandating the search for a new
mathematics capable of restoring the invariance of quantum mechanics.

1.5 Guide to the Research. The ﬁrst need for a serious study in the problem considered
is theidentiﬁcation of a new mathematics speciﬁcally constructed for the invariant treatment
of irreversibility at the classical and operator levels.

As an example, classical Lie-admissible equatisons (1.15) and (1.22) are manifestly not
derivable from a potential (because variationally nonselfadjoint [6]), and, consequently, they
do not admit a unique and ambiguous map into an operator form.

As a matter of fact, the lack of a universal representation of nonconservative forced via
a variational principle is a main historical reason for the inability of the physics of the 20-th
century to conduct quantitative studies on the origin of irreversibility.

As a result, a primary objective of the needed new mathematics is that of achieving a
directly universal representation of all (suﬃciently smooth) nonconservative and irreversible
systems via a variational principle. The needed new mathematics will be presented in the
next section. Our classical invariant treatment of irreversibility is presented in Section 3 and
its operator counterpart is presented in Section 4.

12

The second need for a serious study in the origin of irreversibility is the inclusion of

antimatter ab initio.

Note that all the preceding theories were solely intended for the representation of matter
and are inapplicable to antimatter for numerous reasons. For instance, classical equations
(1.15) and (1.22) permit no diﬀerentiation at all between neutral matter and antimatter
stars. Assuming that said equations admit a sort of operator map, the operator image of a
classical representation of antimatter with the sole change of the sign of the charge (as solely
done in the 20-th century) would be given by a ”particle” with the wrong sign of the charge
and deﬁnitely not by a charge conjugated ”antiparticle.”

In any case, one of the historical scientiﬁc imbalances of the 20-th century has been the
treatment of matter at all possible levels, from Newtonian mechanics to quantum ﬁeld theory,
while antimatter was treated at the sole level of second quantization. In turn this imbalance
has prohibited the initiation of the study whether a far away galaxy or quasar is made up of
matter of antimatter (since such a study requires a consistent classical gravitational theory of
antimatter with null total charge, thus without the use of the charge for the characterization
of antimatter).

In view of these and other insuﬃciencies, the author had to conduct a separate laborious
construction of a new mathematics speciﬁcally conceived for the treatment of antiparticle
at the classical level in such a way to yield operator images equivalent to charge conjugated
states.

This new mathematics, today known as Santilli’s isodual mathematics, is based on the

application of the isodual map, here generically expressed by

Q(t, r, ψ, ∂ψ, ...) → Qd(td, rd, ψd, ∂dψd, ...) = −Q†(−t†, −r†, −ψ†, −∂†(−ψ†), ...)

(1.39)

applied to the totality of the mathematical and physical formulations used for matter, result-
ing in this way in the novel isodual numbers, isodual ﬁelds, isodual spaces, isodual diﬀerential
calculus, isodual functional analysis, isodual geometries, Lie-Santilli isodual theory, isodual
symmetries, etc..

The classical and operator isodual theory of antimatter cannot possibly be reviewed in
this paper to avoid a prohibitive length. We must, therefore, refer the reader to the existing
literature, such as monographs [18,22] (see monographs [66-72] for independent studies) and
vast literature quoted therein.

The reader should be alerted that the restriction of the studies on the origin of irre-
versibility solely to matter, as done in the 20-th century, is insuﬃcient and actually insidious
because, as now known for grand uniﬁcations [22], certain basic insuﬃciencies emerge only
when the study of antimatter is included ab initio.

The third need for a serious study of irreversibility is the joint consideration of open,

nonconservative and irreversible as well as closed, conservative and irreversible systems.

As a matter of fact, some of the most relevant irreversible systems can be considered as
isolated from the rest of the universe at the classical level (such as the study of the structure
of Jupiter) as well as at the operator level (such as the study of the structure of a star),
in which case these systems verify all ten conventional total conservation laws, while being
intrinsically irreversible.

In view of such a need, Santilli proposed his Lie-admissible formulations as a covering,
not of conventional Lie formulation, but as a covering of the broader irreversible Lie-isotopic

13

formulations [11,12]. The latter were originally based on the following operator equations

(1.40a)

(1.40b)

(1.40c)

(1.41)

(1.42)

i ×

= A ˆ×H − H ˆ×A =

dA
dt

= A × T (t, r, ψ, ∂ψ, ...) × H − H × T (t, r, ψ, ∂ψ, ×A = [A, H]∗,

A(t) = W (t) × A(0) × W †(t) = (ei×H×T ×t) × A(0) × (e−i×t×T ×H),

W × W † 6= I, T = T † > 0, H = H †,

with classical counterpart given by Birkhoﬀ’s equatsions [6b]

dA
dt

=

∂A
∂bµ × Ωµν(t, b) ×

∂H(b)
∂bν = [A, H]∗.

In both cases the brackets of the time evolution [A, H]∗ are totally antisymmetric, thus

permitting the conservation law of the energy

i ×

dH
dt

= [H, H]∗ ≡ 0,

as well as all other conventional conservation laws [18], under a full representation of irre-
versibility given by

T (t, r, ψ, ∂ψ, ...) 6= T (−t, r, ψ, ∂ψ, ...).

(1.43)

In particular, the generalized brackets [A, B]∗ verify the Lie axioms, although they have a
nontrivial generalized structure (e.g., due to the general noncommutativity of H and T) and
they characterize a formulation, today known as Lie-Santilli isotheory [6b,11,18,22-72] that
includes isoenveloping algebras, Lie-Santilli isoalgebras, Lie-Santilli isogroups, isorepresen-
tation theory, isotransformation theory, etc.

We cannot possibly review in this paper the latter formulations and are regrettably
forced to refer the reader to the existing literature (see, e.g., monographs [18] and vast
contributions quoted therein). For the limited scope of this paper we merely indicate that
closed irreversible conditions are generally obtained by restricting the Lie-admissible brackets
to be antisymmetric, yet generalized form. As an illustration, this condition is reached for
the operator case by requiring that the generally diﬀerent R and S operators coincide, are
Hermitean and actually positive deﬁnite (for certain topological conditions required by the
underlying isotopology), R = S = T = T † > 0.

In summary, in this paper we shall consider: 1) Conventional, closed and reversible sys-
tems of particles represented with conventional symbols such as t, r, H, etc., conventional
associative product × and conventional Lie theory; 2) Closed irreversible systems of par-
ticles represented with ˆ over conventional symbols, and the Lie-Santilli isotheory; 3) Open
irreversible systems of particles moving forward in time represented with the upper index >,
and related Santilli’s Lie-admissible theory; 4) Open irreversible systems of particles moving
backward in time represented with the upper index <, and related Santilli’s Lie-admissible
theory; and 5) The antiparticle counterpart of all preceding systems 1-4 represented with
the superscript d denoting isoduality.

Needless to say, the polyhedric character of problem as well as the complexity of each
individual aspect, are such that, despite the decades of studies by the author, studies the

14

origin of irreversibility are at their infancy because so much remains to be done. It is hoped
that this paper will stimulate young minds of any age to contribute to one of the ultimate
frontiers of knowledge.

2. ELEMENTS OF SANTILLI GENOMATHEMATICS AND ITS ISODUAL
2.1 Genounits, Genoproducts and their Isoduals In the author’s view, there cannot
be a truly new physical theory without a new mathematics, and there cannot be a truly new
mathematics without new numbers. Therefore, the resolution of the problem of invariance
for nonunitary theories required laborious eﬀorts in the search of new numbers capable of
representing irreversibility via their own axiomatic structure.

After failed attempts and a futile search in the mathematical literature, Santilli proposed
[11,12] of 1978 the construction of a new mathematics speciﬁcally conceived for
in Refs.
the indicated task, whose number theory eventually reached mathematical maturity only in
paper [13] of 1993, mathematical maturity for the new diﬀerential calculus in memoir [14] of
1996 and, ﬁnally, an invariant formulation of Lie-admissible formulations only in paper [15]
of 1997.

The new Lie-admissible mathematics is today known as Santilli genomathematics [66-
76], where the preﬁx “geno” suggested in the original proposal [11,12] is used in the Greek
meaning of “inducting” new Axioms (as compared to the preﬁx “iso” of the preceding chapter
denoting the preservation of the axioms).

The basic idea is to lift the isounits of the Lie-isotopic theory [18] into a form that is still
nowhere singular, but non-Hermitean, thus implying the existence of two diﬀerent generalized
units, today called Santilli genounits for the description of matter, that are generally written
[13]

ˆI > = 1/ ˆT >, < ˆI = 1/< ˆT ,
ˆI > = (< ˆI)†,

ˆI > 6=< ˆI,

with two additional isodual genounits for the description of antimatter [14]

( ˆI >)d = −( ˆI >)

= −< ˆI = −1/< ˆT ,

(< ˆI)d = − ˆI > = −1/ ˆT >.

†

(2.2)

Jointly, all conventional and/or isotopic products A ˆ×B among generic quantities (num-
bers, vector ﬁelds, operators, etc.) are lifted in such a form to admit the genounits as the
correct left and right units at all levels, i.e.,

A > B = A × ˆT > × B, A > ˆI > = ˆI > > A = A,

A < B = A ×< ˆT × B, A << ˆI =< ˆI < A = A,
A >d B = A × ˆT >d × B, A >d ˆI >d = ˆI >d >d A = A,
A <d B = A ×< ˆT d × B, A <d < ˆI d = < ˆI d <d A = A,

for all elements A, B of the set considered.

As we shall see in Section 3, the above basic assumptions permit the representation
of irreversibility with the most primitive possible quantities, the basic units and related
products.

15

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

(2.3c)

(2.3d)

In particular, genounits permit an invariant representation of the external forces in La-
grange’s and Hamilton’s equations. As such, they are generally dependent on time, coordi-
nates, momenta., wavefunctions and any other needed variable, e.g., ˆI > = ˆI >(t>, r>, p>, ψ>, . . .).
The assumption of all ordered product to the right > permits the representation of matter
systems moving forward in time, the assumption of all ordered products to the left < can
represent matter systems moving backward in time, with corresponding antimatter systems
represented by the respective isodual ordered products >d= − >† and <d= − <>†. Irre-
versibility is represented ab initio by the inequality A > B 6= A < B for matter and >d6=<d
for antimatter.

Note that the simpler isotopic cases are given by ˆI > =< ˆI = ˆI = ˆI † > 0 for matter and

ˆI >d =< ˆI d = ˆI d = ˆI d† < 0 for antimatter.

In conclusion, the reader should be aware that genomathematics consists of four branches,
the forward and backward genomathematics for matter and their isoduals for antimatter, each
paid being interconnected by time reversal, the two pairs being interconnected by isodual
map (1.39) that, as it is well known [22], is equivalent to charge conjugation.

2.2. Genonumbers, Genofunctional Analysis and their Isoduals Genomathematics
began to reach maturity with the discovery made, apparently for the ﬁrst time in paper [13]
of 1993, that the axioms of a ﬁeld still hold under the ordering of all products to the right
or, independently, to the left.

This unexpected property permitted the formulation of new numbers, that can be best in-
troduced as a generalization of the isonumbers [18], although they can also be independently
presented as follows:

DEFINITION 2.1 [13]: Let F = F (a, +, ×) be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero as per
Deﬁnitions 2.2.1 and 3.2.1. Santilli’s forward genoﬁelds are rings ˆF > = ˆF (ˆa>, ˆ+>, ˆ×>)
with: elements

ˆa> = a × ˆI >,
(2.4)
where a ∈ F , ˆI > = 1/ ˆT > is a non singular non-Hermitean quantity (number, matrix or
operator) generally outside F and × is the ordinary product of F ; the genosum ˆ+> coincides
with the ordinary sum +,

ˆa> ˆ+>ˆb> ≡ ˆa> + ˆb>, ∀ˆa>, ˆb> ∈ ˆF >,

consequently, the additive forward genounit ˆ0> ∈ ˆF coincides with the ordinary 0 ∈ F ; and
the forward genoproduct > is such that ˆI > is the right and left isounit of ˆF >,

ˆI > ˆ×ˆa> = ˆa> > ˆI > ≡ ˆa>, ∀ˆa> ∈ ˆF >.

Santilli’s forward genoﬁelds verify the following properties:
1) For each element ˆa> ∈ ˆF > there is an element ˆa>−ˆ1>

, called forward genoinverse, for

which

ˆa> > ˆa>− ˆI >

= ˆI >, ∀ˆa> ∈ ˆF >;

2) The genosum is commutative

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

ˆa> ˆ+>ˆb> = ˆb> ˆ+>ˆa>,

16

and associative

(ˆa> ˆ+>ˆb>) +> ˆc> = ˆa> ˆ+>(ˆb> ˆ+>ˆc>), ∀ˆa, ˆb, ˆc ∈ ˆF ;

(2.9)

3) The forward genoproduct is associative

ˆa> > (ˆb> > ˆc>) = (ˆa> > ˆb>) > ˆc>, ∀ˆa>, ˆb>, ˆc> ∈ ˆF >;

(2.10)

but not necessarily commutative

4) The set ˆF > is closed under the genosum,

ˆa> > ˆb> 6= ˆb> > ˆa>,

ˆa> ˆ+>ˆb> = ˆc> ∈ ˆF >,

ˆa> > ˆb> = ˆc> ∈ ˆF >,

the forward genoproduct,

and right and left genodistributive compositions,

ˆa> > (ˆb> ˆ+>ˆc>) = ˆd> ∈ ˆF >,

(ˆa> ˆ+>ˆb>) > ˆc> = ˆd> ∈ ˆF > ∀ˆa>, ˆb>, ˆc>, ˆd> ∈ ˆF >;

5) The set ˆF > veriﬁes the right and left genodistributive law

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14a)

(2.14b)

ˆa> > (ˆb> ˆ+>ˆc>) = (ˆa> ˆ+>ˆb>) > ˆc> = ˆd>, ∀ˆa>, ˆb>, ˆc>, ∈ ˆF >.

(2.15)

In this way we have the forward genoreal numbers ˆR>, the forward genocomplex numbers
ˆC > and the forward genoquaternionic numbers ˆQC > while the forward genooctonions ˆO>
can indeed be formulated but they do not constitute genoﬁelds [14].

The backward genoﬁelds and the isodual forward and backward genoﬁelds are deﬁned
accordingly. Santilli’s genoﬁelds are called of the ﬁrst (second) kind when the genounit is (is
not) an element of F.

The basic axiom-preserving character of genoﬁelds is illustrated by the following:

LEMMA 2.1 [13]: Genoﬁelds of ﬁrst and second kind are ﬁelds (namely, they verify all

axioms of a ﬁeld).

Note that the conventional product “2 multiplied by 3” is not necessarily equal to 6

because, for isodual numbers with unit −1 it is given by −6 [13].

The same product “2 multiplied by 3” is not necessarily equal to +6 or −6 because,
for the case of isonumbers, it can also be equal to an arbitrary number, or a matrix or an
integrodiﬀerential operator depending on the assumed isounit [13].

In this section we point out that “2 multiplied by 3” can be ordered to the right or to the
left, and the result is not only arbitrary, but yielding diﬀerent numerical results for diﬀerent
orderings, 2 > 3 6= 2 < 3, all this by continuing to verify the axioms of a ﬁeld per each order
[13].

17

Once the forward and backward genoﬁelds have been identiﬁed, the various branches of

genomathematics can be constructed via simple compatibility arguments.

For speciﬁc applications to irreversible processes there is ﬁrst the need to construct the
genofunctional analysis, studied in Refs. [6,18] that we cannot review here for brevity. the
reader is however warned that any elaboration of irreversible processes via Lie-admissible
formulations based on conventional or isotopic functional analysis leads to catastrophic in-
consistencies because it would be the same as elaborating quantum mechanical calculations
with genomathematics.

As an illustration, Theorems 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 of catastrophic inconsistencies are activated
unless one uses the ordinary diﬀerential calculus is lifted, for ordinary motion in time of
matter, into the following forward genodiﬀerentials and genoderivatives

ˆd>x = ˆT >

x × dx,

ˆ∂>
ˆ∂>x

= ˆI >

x ×

, etc.

∂
∂x

with corresponding backward and isodual expressions here ignored,

Similarly, all conventional functions and isofunctions, such as isosinus, isocosinus, isolog,

etc., have to be lifted in the genoform

ˆf >(x>) = f (ˆx>) × ˆI >,

where one should note the necessity of the multiplication by the genounit as a condition for
the result to be in ˆR>, ˆC >, or ˆO>.

2.3. Genogeometries and Their IsodualsParticularly intriguing are the genogeometries
[16] (see also monographs [18] for detailed treatments). They are best characterized by a
simple genotopy of the isogeometries, although they can be independenntly deﬁned.

As an illustration, the Minkowski-Santilli forward genospace ˆM >(ˆx>, ˆη>, ˆR>) over the
genoreal ˆR> is characterized by the following spacetime, genocoordinates, genometric and
genoinvariant

ˆx> = x ˆI > = {xµ} × ˆI >,
ˆx>2>

= ˆx>µ ˆ×> ˆη>

ˆη> = ˆT > × η,

µν ˆ×> ˆx>ν = (xµ × ˆη>

η = Diag.(1, 1, 1, −1),
µν × xν) × ˆI >,

(4.18a)

(2.18b)

where the ﬁrst expression of the genoinvariant is on genospaces while the second is its
projection in our spacetime.

Note that the minkowski-Santilli genospace has, in general, an explicit dependence on
spacetime coordinates. Consequently, it is equipped with the entire formalism of the conven-
tional Riemannian spaces covariant derivative, Christoﬀel’s symbols, Bianchi identity, etc.
only lifted from the isotopic form of the preceding chapter into the genotopic form.

A most important feature is that genospaces permit, apparently for the ﬁrst time in
scientiﬁc history, the representation of irreversibility directly via the basic genometric. This
is due to the fact that genometrics are nonsymmetric by conception, e.g.,

Consequently, genotopies permit the lifting of conventional symmetric metrics into non-

symmetric forms,

Remarkably, nonsymmetric metrics bare indeed permitted by the axioms of conventional

spaces as illustrated by the invariance

(xµ × ηµν × xν) × I ≡ [xµ × ( ˆT > × ηµν) × xν] × T >−1 ≡

≡ (xµ × ˆη>

µν × xν) × ˆI >,

(2.21)

where ˆT > is assumed in this simple illustration to be a complex number.

Interested readers can then work out backward genogeometries and the isodual forward

and backward genogeometries with their underlying genofunctional analysis.

This basic geometric feature was not discovered until recently because hidden where
nobody looked for, in the basic unit. However, this basic geometric advance in the repre-
sentation of irreversibility required the prior discovery of basically new numbers, Santilli’s
genonumbers with nonsymmetric unit and ordered multiplication [14].

2.4. Santilli Lie-Admissible heory and its Isodual Particularly important for irre-
versibility is the lifting of Lie’s theory and Lie-Santilli’s isotheories permitted by genomathe-
matics, ﬁrst identiﬁed by Ref. [11] of 1978 (and then studied in various works, e.g., [6,18-22])
via the following genotopies:

(1) The forward and backward universal enveloping genoassociative algebra ˆξ>, < ˆξ, with

inﬁnite-dimensional basis characterizing the Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt-Santilli genotheorem

ˆξ> : ˆI >, ˆXi, ˆXi > ˆXj, ˆXi > ˆXj > ˆXk, . . . , i ≤ j ≤ k,

(2.22a)

< ˆξ : ˆI, < ˆXi, ˆXi < ˆXj, ˆXi < ˆXj < ˆXk, . . . , i ≤ j ≤ k;
where the “hat” on the generators denotes their formulation on genospaces over genoﬁelds
and their Hermiticity implies that ˆX > =< ˆX = ˆX;

(2.22b)

(2) The Lie-Santilli genoalgebras characterized by the universal, jointly Lie- and Jordan-

admissible brackets,

< ˆL> : ( ˆXiˆ, ˆXj) = ˆXi < ˆXj − ˆXj > ˆXi = C k

ij × ˆXk,

(2.23)

here formulated formulated in an invariant form (see below);

(3) The Lie-Santilli genotransformation groups

< ˆG> : ˆA( ˆw) = (ˆe

ˆi ˆ× ˆX ˆ× ˆw)> > ˆA(ˆ0) << (ˆe−ˆi ˆ× ˆw ˆ× ˆX) =

= (ei× ˆX× ˆT >×w) × A(0) × (e−i×w×< ˆT × ˆX),

(2.24)

where ˆw> ∈ ˆR> are the genoparameters; the genorepresentation theory, etc.

2.5. Genosymmetries and Nonconservation LawsThe implications of the Santilli Lie-
admissible theory are signiﬁcant mathematically and physically. On mathematical grounds,
the Lie-Santilli genoalgebras are “directly universal” and include as particular cases all known
algebras, such as Lie, Jordan, Flexible algebras, power associative algebras, quantum, alge-
bras, supersymmetric algebras, Kac-Moody algebras, etc. (Section 1.5).

Moreover, when computed on the genobimodule

< ˆB> =< ˆξ × ˆξ>,

19

(2.25)

Lie-admissible algebras verify all Lie axioms, while deviations from Lie algebras emerge only
in their projection on the conventional bimodule

<B> =< ξ × ξ>,

This is due to the fact that the computation of the left action A < B = A×< ˆT ×B on < ˆξ
(that is, with respect to the genounit < ˆI = 1/< ˆT ) yields the save value as the computation
of the conventional product A × B on <ξ (that is, with respect to the trivial unit I), and
the same occurs for the value of A > B on ˆξ>.

The above occurrences explain the reason the structure constant and the product in the

r.h.s. of Eq. (4.2.23) are those of a conventional Lie algebra.

In this way, thanks to genomathematics, Lie algebras acquire a towering signiﬁcance in

view of the possibility of reducing all possible irreversible systems to primitive Lie axioms.

fact, Noether’s theorem on the reduction of reversible conservation laws to primitive Lie
symmetries can be lifted to the reduction, this time, of irreversible nonconservation laws to
primitive Lie-Santilli genosymmetries.

As a matter of fact, this reduction was the very ﬁrst motivation for the construction
of the genotheory in memoir [12] (see also monographs [6,18,19,20]). The reader can then
foresee similar liftings of all remaining physical aspects treated via Lie algebras.

The construction of the isodual Lie-Santilli genotheory is an instructive exercise for read-

ers interested in learning the new methods.

3. LIE-ADMISSIBLE CLASSICAL MECHANICS FOR MATTER AND ITS
ISODUAL FOR ANTIMATTER
3.1. Fundamental Ordering Assumption on Irreversibility Another reason for the
inability during the 20-th century for in depth studies of irreversibility is the general belief
that motion in time has only two directions, forward and backward (Eddington historical time
arrows). In reality, motion in time admits four diﬀerent forms, all essential for serious studies
in irreversibility, given by: 1) motion forward to future time characterized by the forward
genotime ˆt>; 2) motion backward to past time characterized by the backward genotime <ˆt;
3) motion backward from future time characterized by the isodual forward genotime ˆt>d; and
4) motion forward from past time characterized by the isodual backward genotime <ˆtd.

It is at this point where the necessity of both time reversal and isoduality appears in
its full light. In fact, time reversal is only applicable to matter and, being represented with
Hermitean conjugation, permits the transition from motion forward to motion backward in
time, ˆt> →< ˆt = (ˆt>)†. If used alone, time reversal cannot identify all four directions of
motions. The only additional conjugation known to this author that is applicable at alllevels
of study and is equivalent to charge conjugation, is isoduality [22].

The additional discovery of two complementary orderings of the product and related
units, with corresponding isoduals versions, individually preserving the abstract axioms of a
ﬁeld has truly fundamental implications for irreversibility, since it permits the axiomatically
consistent and invariant representation of irreversibility via the most ultimate and primitive
axioms, those on the product and related unit. We, therefore, have the following:

20

(3.1)

(3.2)

FUNDAMENTAL ORDERING ASSUMPTION ON IRREVERSIBILITY [15]: Dynam-
ical equations for motion forward in time of matter (antimatter) systems are characterized
by genoproducts to the right and related genounits (their isoduals), while dynamical equations
for the motion backward in time of matter (antimatter) are characterized by genoproducts to
the left and related genounits (their isoduals) under the condition that said genoproducts and
genounits are interconnected by time reversal expressible for generic quantities A, B with the
relation,

(A > B)† = (A > ˆT > × B)† = B† × ( ˆT >)† × A†,

namely,

ˆT > = (< ˆT )†

thus recovering the fundamental complementary conditions (4.1.17) or (4.2.2).

Unless otherwise speciﬁed, from now on physical and chemical expression for irreversible
processes will have no meaning without the selection of one of the indicated two possible
orderings.

3.2. Geno-Newtonian Equations and Their Isoduals Recall that, for the case of
isotopies, the basic Newtonian systems are given by those admitting nonconservative internal
forces restricted by certain constraints to verify total conservation laws called closed non-
Hamiltonian systems [6b,18].

For the case of the genotopies under consideration here, the basic Newtonian systems are
the conventional nonconservative systems without subsidiary constraints, known asopen non-
Hamiltonian systems, with generic expression (1.3), in which case irreversibility is entirely
characterized by nonselfadjoint forces, since all conservative forces are reversible.

As it is well known, the above equations are not derivable from any variational principle
in the ﬁxed frame of the observer [6], and this is the reason all conventional attempts for
consistently quantizing nonconservative forces have failed for about one century. In turn,
the lack of achievement of a consistent operator counterpart of nonconservative forces lead
to the belief that they are illusory because they disappear at the particle level.

The studies presented in this paper have achieved the ﬁrst and only physically consistent
operator formulation of nonconservative forces known to the author. This goal was achieved
by rewriting Newton’s equations (1.3) into an identical form derivable from a variational
principle. Still in turn, the latter objective was solely permitted by the novel genomathe-
matics.

It is appropriate to recall that Newton was forced to discover new mathematics, the
diﬀerential calculus, prior to being able to formulated his celebrated equations. Therefore,
readers should not be surprised at the need for the new genodiﬀerential calculus as a condition
to represent all nonconservative Newton’s systems from a variational principle.

Recall also from Section 3,1 that, contrary to popular beliefs, there exist four inequivalent
directions of time. Consequently, time reversal alone cannot represent all these possible
motions, and isoduality results to be the only known additional conjugation that, when
combined with time reversal, can represent all possible time evolutions of both matter and
antimatter.

The above setting implies the existence of four diﬀerent new mechanics ﬁrst formulated
by Santilli in memoir [14] of 1996, and today known as Newton-Santilli genomechanics,
namely:

21

antimatter systems, and

C) Isodual backward genomechanics for the representation of motion backward in time of

D) Isodual forward genomechanics for the representation of time reversal antimatter

These new mechanics are characterized by:

Newton-Santilli genoequations (4.3.12) are “directly universal” for the representation of
all possible (well behaved) Eqs. (1.3) in the frame of the observer because they admit a
multiple inﬁnity of solution for any given nonselfadjoint force.

A simple representation occurs under the conditions assumed for simplicity,

that always admit solutions here left to the interested reader since in the next section we
shall show a much simpler, universal, algebraic solution.

As one can see, in Newton’s equations the nonpotential forces are part of the applied
force, while in the Newton-Santilli genoequations nonpotential forces are represented by the
genounits, or, equivalently, by the genodiﬀerential calculus, in a way essentially similar to
the case of isotopies.

The main diﬀerence between iso- and geno-equations is that isounits are Hermitean,
thus implying the equivalence of forward and backward motions, while genounits are non-
Hermitean, thus implying irreversibility.

23

Note also that the topology underlying Newton’s equations is the conventional, Euclidean,

local-diﬀerential topology which, as such, can only represent point particles.

By contrast, the topology underlying the Newton-Santilli genoequations is given by a
genotopy of the isotopology studied in the preceding chapter, thus permitting for the repre-
sentation of extended, nonspherical and deformable particles via forward genounits, e.g., of
the type

ˆI > = Diag.(n2

where n2
4 represents the density of the
medium in which motion occurs (with more general nondiagonal realizations here omitted
for simplicity), and Γ> constitutes a nonsymmetric matrix representing nonselfadjoint forces,
namely, the contact interactions among extended constituents occurring for the motion for-
ward in time.

3.3. Lie-Admissible Classical Genomechanics and its Isodual In this section we show
that, once rewritten in their identical genoform (4.3.12), Newton’s equations for nonconser-
vative systems are indeed derivable from a variational principle, with analytic equations
possessing a Lie-admissible structure and Hamilton-Jacobi equations suitable for the ﬁrst
know consistent and unique operator map studied in the next section.

The most eﬀective setting to introduce real-valued non-symmetric genounits is in the
6N-dimensional forward genospace (genocotangent bundle) with local genocoordinates and
their conjugates

where ωµν is the conventional Lie tensor and, consequently, Sµν is Lie-admissible in the sense

As one can see, the important consequence of genomathematics and its genodiﬀerential
calculus is that of turning the triple system (A, H, F N SA) of Eqs. (1.5) in the bilinear form
(Aˆ,B), thus characterizing a consistent algebra in the brackets of the time evolution.

This is the central purpose for which genomathematics was built (note that the multi-
plicative factors represented by K are ﬁxed for each given system). The invariance of such
a formulation will be proved shortly.

It is an instructive exercise for interested readers to prove that the brackets (Aˆ,B) are

Lie-admissible, although not Jordan-admissible.

It is easy to verify that the above identical reformulation of Hamilton’s historical time
evolution correctly recovers the time rate of variations of physical quantities in general, and
that of the energy in particular,

Note the direct universality of the Lie-admissible equations for the representation of all
inﬁnitely possible Newton equations (1.3) (universality) directly in the ﬁxed frame of the
experimenter (direct universality).

Note also that, at the abstract, realization-free level, Hamilton-Santilli genoequations
coincide with Hamilton’s equations without external terms, yet represent those with external
terms.

The latter are reformulated via genomathematics as the only known way to achieve
invariance and derivability from a variational principle while admitting a consistent algebra
in the brackets of the time evolution [38].

Therefore, Hamilton-Santilli genoequations (3.6.66) are indeed irreversible for all pos-
sible reversible Hamiltonians, as desired. The origin of irreversibility rests in the contact
nonpotential forces F N SA according to Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s teaching that is merely
reformulated in an invariant way.

The above Lie-admissible mechanics requires, for completeness, three additional formu-
lations, the backward genomechanics for the description of matter moving backward in time,
and the isoduals of both the forward and backward mechanics for the description of anti-
matter.

The construction of these additional mechanics is lefty to the interested reader for brevity.

4. LIE-ADMISSIBLE OPERATOR MECHANICS FOR MATTER AND ITS
ISODUAL FOR ANTIMATTER
4.1. Basic Dynamical Equations A simple genotopy of the naive or symplectic quan-
tization applied to Eqs. (3.24) yields the Lie-admissible branch of hadronic mechanics [18]
comprising four diﬀerent formulations, the forward and backward genomechanics for matter
and their isoduals for antimatter. The forward genomechanics for matter is characterized by
the following main topics:

1) The nowhere singular (thus everywhere invertible) non-Hermitean forward genounit
for the representation of all eﬀects causing irreversibility, such as contact nonpotential inter-
actions among extended particles, etc. (see the subsequent chapters for various realizations)
ˆI > = 1/ ˆT > 6= ( ˆI >)†,

(4.1)

with corresponding ordered product and genoreal ˆR> and genocomplex ˆC > genoﬁelds;

2) The forward genotopic Hilbert space ˆH> with forward genostates | ˆψ> > and forward

genoinner product

<< ˆψ| > | ˆψ> > × ˆI > =<< ˆψ| × ˆT > × | ˆψ> > × ˆI > ∈ ˆC >,

(4.2)

26

and fundamental property

ˆI > > | ˆψ> >= | ˆψ> >,
(4.3)
holding under the condition that ˆI > is indeed the correct unit for motion forward in time,
and forward genounitary transforms

ˆU > > (< ˆU )†> = (< ˆU)†> > ˆU > = ˆI >;

(4.4)

3) The fundamental Lie-admissible equations, ﬁrst proposed in Ref. [12] of 1974 (p. 783,
Eqs. (4.18.16)) as the foundations of hadronic mechanics, formulated on conventional spaces
over conventional ﬁelds, and ﬁrst formulated in Refs.
[14,18] of 1996 on genospaces and
genodiﬀerential calculus on genoﬁelds, today’s known as Heisenberg-Santilli genoequations,
that can be written in the ﬁnite form

ˆi ˆ× ˆH ˆ×ˆt
ˆA(ˆt) = ˆU > > ˆA(0) << ˆU = (ˆe
>

) > ˆA(ˆ0) < (<ˆe−ˆi ˆ×ˆt ˆ× ˆH) =

= (ei× ˆH× ˆT >×t) × A(0) × (e−i×t×< ˆT × ˆH),

(4.5)

with corresponding inﬁnitesimal version

ˆi ˆ×

ˆd ˆA
ˆdˆt

= ( ˆAˆ, ˆH) = ˆA < ˆH − ˆH > ˆA =

= ˆA ×< ˆT (ˆt, ˆr, ˆp, ˆψ, . . . .) × ˆH − ˆH × ˆT >(ˆt, ˆr, ˆp, ˆψ, . . .) × ˆA,

(4.6)

where there is no time arrow, since Heisenberg’s equations are computed at a ﬁxed time.

4) The equivalent Schr¨odinger-Santilli genoequations, ﬁrst suggested in the original pro-
posal [12] to build hadronic mechanics (see also Refs. [17,23,24]), formulated via conventional
mathematics and in Refs. [14,18] via genomathematics, that can be written

ˆi> >

| ˆψ> >= ˆH > > | ˆψ> >=

ˆ∂>
ˆ∂>ˆt>

= ˆH(ˆr, ˆv) × ˆT >(ˆt, ˆr, ˆp, ˆψ, ˆ∂ ˆψ . . .) × | ˆψ> >= E> > |ψ> >,

(4.7)

where the time orderings in the second term are ignored for simplicity of notation;

5) The forward genomomentum that escaped identiﬁcation for two decades and was ﬁnally

identiﬁed thanks to the genodiﬀerential calculus in Ref. [14] of 1996

k > | ˆψ> >= −ˆi> > ˆ∂>
ˆp>

k | ˆψ> >= −i × ˆI > i

k × ∂i| ˆψ> >,

6) The fundamental genocommutation rules also ﬁrst identiﬁed in Ref. [14],

(ˆriˆ, ˆpj) = i × δi

j × ˆI >, (ˆriˆ, ˆrj) = (ˆpiˆ, ˆpj) = 0,

7) The genoexpectation values of an observable for the forward motion ˆA> [14,19]

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

<< ˆψ| > ˆA> > | ˆψ> >
<< ˆψ| > | ˆψ> >

× ˆI > ∈ ˆC >,

27

under which the genoexpectation values of the genounit recovers the conventional Planck’s
unit as in the isotopic case,

< ˆψ| > ˆI > > | ˆψ >
< ˆψ| > | ˆψ >

= I.

(4.11)

The following comments are now in order. Note ﬁrst in the genoaction principle the
crucial independence of isoaction ˆA> in form the linear momentum, as expressed by the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Santilli genoequations (4.3.25). Such independence assures that genoquan-
tization yields a genowavefunction solely dependent on time and coordinates, ˆψ> = ˆψ>(t, r).
Other geno-Hamiltonian mechanics studied previously [7] do not verify such a condi-
tion, thus implying genowavefunctions with an explicit dependence also on linear momenta,
ˆψ> = ˆψ>(t, r, p) that violate the abstract identity of quantum and hadronic mechanics whose
treatment in any case is beyond our operator knowledge at this writing.

Note that forward geno-Hermiticity coincides with conventional Hermiticity. As a result,
all quantities that are observables for quantum mechanics remain observables for the above
genomechanics.

However, unlike quantum mechanics, physical quantities are generally nonconserved, as

it must be the case for the energy,

ˆi> >

ˆd> ˆH >
ˆd>ˆt>

= ˆH × (< ˆT − ˆT >) × ˆH 6= 0.

(4.12)

Therefore, the genotopic branch of hadronic mechanics is the only known operator for-
mulation permitting nonconserved quantities to be Hermitean as a necessary condition to be
observability.

Other formulation attempt to represent nonconservation, e.g., by adding an “imaginary
potential” to the Hamiltonian, as it is often done in nuclear physics [25]. In this case the
Hamiltonian is non-Hermitean and, consequently, the nonconservation of the energy cannot
be an observable.

Besides, said “nonconservative models” with non-Hermitean Hamiltonians are nonunitary
and are formulated on conventional spaces over conventional ﬁelds, thus suﬀering all the
catastrophic inconsistencies of Theorem 1.3.

We should stress the representation of irreversibility and nonconservation beginning with
the most primitive quantity, the unit and related product. Closed irreversible systems are
characterized by the Lie-isotopic subcase in which

ˆi ˆ×

ˆd ˆA
ˆdˆt

= [ ˆAˆ, ˆH] = ˆA × ˆT (t, . . .) × ˆH − ˆH × ˆT (t, . . .) × ˆA,

< ˆT (t, . . .) = ˆT >(t, . . .) = ˆT (t, . . .) = ˆT †(t, . . .) 6= ˆT (−t, . . .),

4.13a)

(4.13b)

for which the Hamiltonian is manifestly conserved. Nevertheless the system is manifestly
irreversible. Note also the ﬁrst and only known observability of the Hamiltonian (due to its
iso-Hermiticity) under irreversibility.

As one can see, brackets (A, B) of Eqs. (4.6) are jointly Lie- and Jordan-admissible.
Note also that ﬁnite genotransforms (4.4.5) verify the condition of genohermiticity, Eq.

(4.4).

28

We should ﬁnally mention that, as it was the case for isotheories, genotheories are also
admitted by the abstract axioms of quantum mechanics, thus providing a broader realization.
This can be seen, e.g., from the invariance under a complex number C

< ψ|x|ψ > ×I =< ψ|xC −1 × |ψ > ×(C × I) =< ψ| > |ψ > ×I >.

Consequently, genomechanics provide another explicit and concrete realization of “hidden
variables” [26], thus constituting another “completion” of quantum mechanics in the E-P-R
sense [27]. For the studies of these aspects we refer the interested reader to Ref. [28].

The above formulation must be completed with three additional Lie-admissible formu-
lations, the backward formulation for matter under time reversal and the two additional
isodual formulations for antimatter. Their study is left to the interested reader for brevity.

4.2. Simple Construction of Lie-Admissible Theories As it was the case for the
isotopies, a simple method has been identiﬁed in Ref.
[44] for the construction of Lie-
admissible (geno-) theories from any given conventional, classical or quantum formulation.
It consists in identifying the genounits as the product of two diﬀerent nonunitary transforms,

and subjecting the totality of quantities and their operations of conventional models to said
dual transforms,

ˆI > = (< ˆI)† = U × W †, < ˆI = W × U †,

U × U † 6= 1, W × W † 6= 1, U × W † = ˆI >,

I → ˆI > = U × I × W †,

I →< ˆI = W × I × U †,

a → ˆa> = U × a × W † = a × ˆI >,
a →< ˆa = W × a × U † =< ˆI × a,
a × b → ˆa> > ˆb> = U × (a × b) × W > =
= (U × a × W †) × (U × W †)−1 × (U × b × W †),
∂/∂x → ˆ∂>/ ˆ∂> ˆx> = U × (∂/∂x) × W † = ˆI > × (∂/∂x),
< ψ| × |ψ >→<< ψ| > |ψ> >= U × (< ψ| × |ψ >) × W †,
H × |ψ >→ ˆH > > |ψ> >=
= (U × H × W †) × (U × W †)−1 × (U × ψ > W †), etc.

(4.16d)

(4.16e)

(4.16f )

(4.4.16g)

As a result, any given conventional, classical or quantum model can be easily lifted into

the genotopic form.

Note that the above construction implies that all conventional physical quantities acquire
a well deﬁned direction of time. For instance, the correct genotopic formulation of energy,
linear momentum, etc., is given by

ˆH > = U × H × W †, ˆp> = U × p × W >, etc.

(4.17)

In fact, under irreversibility, the value of a nonconserved energy at a given time t for motion
forward in time is generally diﬀerent than the corresponding value of the energy for −t for
motion backward in past times.

29

This explains the reason for having represented in this section energy, momentum and
other quantities with their arrow of time >. Such an arrow can indeed be omitted for
notational simplicity, but only after the understanding of its existence.

Note ﬁnally that a conventional, one dimensional, unitary Lie transformation group with
Hermitean generator X and parameter w can be transformed into a covering Lie-admissible
group via the following nonunitary transform

Q(w) × Q†(w) = Q†(w) × Q(w) = I, w ∈ R,

U × U † 6= I, W × W † 6= 1,
A(w) = Q(w) × A(0) × Q†(w) = eX×w×i × A(0) × e−i×w×X →
→ U × (eX×w×i × A(0) × e−i×w×X) × U † =
≡ [U × (eX×w×i) × W † × (U × W †)−1 × A × A(0)×
×U † × (W × U †)−1 × [W × (e−i×w×X) × U †] =
= (ei×X×X)> > A(0) << (e−1×w×X) = ˆU > > A(0) << ˆU ,

(4.18a)

(4.18b)

(4.18c)

which conﬁrm the property of Section 4.2, namely, that under the necessary mathematics the
Lie-admissible theory is indeed admitted by the abstract Lie axioms, and it is a realization
of the latter broader than the isotopic form.

4.3. Invariance of Lie-Admissible Theories Recall that a fundamental axiomatic feature of
quantum mechanics is the invariance under time evolution of all numerical predictions and
physical laws, which invariance is due to the unitary structure of the theory.

However, quantum mechanics is reversible and can only represent in a scientiﬁc way
beyond academic beliefs reversible systems verifying total conservation laws due to the an-
tisymmetric character of the brackets of the time evolution.

As indicated earlier, the representation of irreversibility and nonconservation requires
theories with a nonunitary structure. However, the latter are aﬄicted by the catastrophic
inconsistencies of Theorem 1.3.

The only resolution of such a basic impasse known to the author has been the achieve-
ment of invariance under nonunitarity and irreversibility via the use of genomathematics,
provided that such genomathematics is applied to the totality of the formalism to avoid
evident inconsistencies caused by mixing diﬀerent mathematics for the selected physical
problem.

Let us nmote that, due to decades of protracted use it is easy to predict that physicists
and mathematicians may be tempted to treat the Lie-admissible branch of hadronic me-
chanics with conventional mathematics, whether in part or in full. Such a posture would be
equivalent, for instance, to the elaboration of the spectral emission of the hydrogen atom
with the genodiﬀerential calculus, resulting in an evident nonscientiﬁc setting.

Such an invariance was ﬁrst achieved by Santilli in Ref. [15] of 1997 and can be illustrated

by reformulating any given nonunitary transform in the genounitary form

U = ˆU × ˆT >1/2, W = ˆW × ˆT >1/2,

U × W † = ˆU > ˆW † = ˆW † > ˆU = ˆI > = 1/ ˆT >,

(4.19a)

(4.19b)

30

and then showing that genounits, genoproducts, genoexponentiation, etc., are indeed invari-
ant under the above genounitary transform in exactly the same way as conventional units,
products, exponentiations, etc. are invariant under unitary transforms,

ˆI > → ˆI >′

= ˆU > ˆI > > ˆW † = ˆI >,

(4.20a)

ˆA > ˆB → ˆU > (A > B) > ˆW † =
= ( ˆU × ˆT > × A × T > × ˆW †) × ( ˆT > × W †)−1 × ˆT >×
×( ˆU × ˆT >)−1 × ( ˆU × T > × ˆA × T > × ˆW >) =
= ˆA′ × ( ˆU × ˆW †)−1 × ˆB = ˆA′ × ˆT > × B′ = ˆA′ > ˆB′, etc.

(4.20b)

from which all remaining invariances follow, thus resolving the catastrophic inconsistencies
of Theorem 1.3.

Note the numerical invariances of the genounit ˆI > → ˆI >′

≡ ˆI >, of the genotopic element
≡ ˆT >, and of the genoproduct >→>′≡> that are necessary to have invariant

ˆT > → ˆT >′
numerical predictions.

5. SOCIETAL AND SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS
The societal, let alone scientiﬁc implications of the proper treatment of irreversibility are
rather serious. Our planet is aﬄicted by increasingly catastrophic climactic events mandating
the search for basically new, environmentally acceptable energies and fuels.

All known energy sources, from the combustion of carbon dating to prehistoric times
to the contemporary nuclear energy, are based on structurally irreversible processes. By
comparison, all established doctrines of the 20-th century, such as quantum mechanics and
special relativity, are structurally reversible, that is, reversible in their basic axioms, let alone
their physical laws.

It is then easy to see that the serious search for basically new energies and fuels will
require basically new theories that are as structurally irreversible as the process they are
expected to describe. At any rate, all possible energies and fuels that could be predicted
by quantum mechanics and special relativity were discovered by the middle of the 20-th
century. Hence, the insistence in continuing to restrict irreversible processes to comply with
preferred reversible doctrines may perhaps yield myopic short terms beneﬁts, but also cause
a potentially historical condemnation by posterity.

An eﬀective way to illustrate the need for new irreversible theories is given by nuclear
fusions. All eﬀorts to date in the ﬁeld, whether for the ”cold fusion” or the ”hot fusion,” have
been studiously restricted to verify special relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics.
However, whether ”hot” or ”cold,” all fusion processes are strictly irreversible, while special
relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics are strictly reversible.

It has been shown in Ref. [73] that some of the reasons for the failure to date by both
the ”cold” and the ”hot” fusions to achieve industrial value is due precisely to the treatment
of structurally irreversible nuclear fusions with structurally reversible mathematical and
physical methods.

In the event of residual doubt due to protracted use of preferred theories, it is suﬃcient to
compute the quantum mechanical probability for two nuclei to ”fuse” into a third one, and
then compute its time reversal image. In this way the serious scholar will see that special

31

relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics predict a fully causal spontaneous disintegra-
tion of nuclei following their fusion, namely, a prediction outside the boundary of serious
science.

The inclusion of irreversibility in quantitative studies of new energies then recommend the
development, already partially achieved at the industrial level (see Chapter 8 of Ref. [19]),
of a new, controlled ”intermediate fusion” of light nuclei [73], that is, a fusion occurring at
minimal energies ﬁrstly needed to expose nuclei as a pre-requisite for their fusion (a feature
absent in the ”cold fusion” due to insuﬃcient energies), and secondly necessary to prevent
instabilities at the very high energies of the ”hot fusion” that have been uncontrollable
precisely because due to irreversible processes described by reversible doctrines.

In view of these pressing societal needs, the construction of Lie-admissible and/or Lie-
isotopic coverings of special relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics is advocated, fol-
lowed by experimental veriﬁcations and speciﬁc applications to new clean energies so much
needed by mankind.

Recall that Lorentz, Poincar´e, Einstein, Minkowski and others insisted in the reversible
character of special relativity because necessary for the description of the physical events for
which the relativity was built for.

It is easy to see that, following the above historical teaching, a basically new relativity
must be developed for irreversible processes. In fact, the original proposal of a Lie-admissible
generalization of Lie’s theory of 1978 [11] was intended, speciﬁcally, for the construction of a
Lie-admissible covering of Galileo relativity indicated beginning with the title. The proposed
relativity is expected to be a genotopic covering of the isorelativity already constructed and
veriﬁed [18b,18c].

Another illustration of the implications of the studies herein considered is given by the fact
that all inelastic scatterings in particle physics are irreversible, yet they have been elaborated
in the 20-th century via the conventional (potential) scattering theory which is structurally
reversible. Once possible contributions from irreversibility are duly taken into account, some
of the ”experimental results” in inelastic scatterings of the 20-th century may well turn out
to be ”experimental beliefs.”

In order to implement a serious scientiﬁc process, rather than follow a scientiﬁc religion,
it is necessary to construct Lie-admissible (Lie-isotopic) scattering theory for open (closed)
inelastic reactions via the procedure given in Section 4.2, re-examine existing results on in-
elastic scatterings and establish whether or not irreversibility requires a revision of existing
data. In particular, the proposed irreversible scattering theory is expected to be an exten-
sion of the isotopic scattering theory already embrionically constructed (see Ref. [18b] and
contributions quoted therein).

Far from being inessential, the re-examination of irreversible particle processes via an
axiomatically consistent and invariant irreversible mechanics appears to require a revision of
hadron physics for which hadronic mechanics was built for [12,18]. In fact, various studies
(see, e.g., Refs.
[74,75] and literature quoted therein) have shown the need for a serious
re-examination of quarks, neutrinos and other conjectures, again, to prevent that possible
myopic short term gains in reality set the foundations for a potentially historical condemna-
tion by posterity.

After all, quarks and neutrino cannot be detected directly; their existence is claimed
only on grounds of conventional particles predicted from inelastic scattering elaborated via

32

a reversible scattering theory; and the resulting events admits numerous alternative inter-
pretations, including those via photons emitted by antiparticles.
In any case, quarks are
known not to admit gravity (because they can only be deﬁned in a mathematics internal
space while gravity can only be deﬁned in our spacetime), and admit a rather long list of
additional basically unsolved insuﬃciencies [18c,73-75].

In closing, the main objectives of this paper are to establish beyond credible doubt that
the problem of the origin of irreversibility is more open then ever; to illustrate the societal,
let alone scientiﬁc need for its systematic study; to propose a quantitative, axiomatically
consistent representation of irreversibility at the classical and operator levels as well as for
matter and antimatter; and to solicit alternative formulations by interested colleagues, under
the condition that they are as directly universal and invariant as the proposed Lie-admissible
and Lie-isotopic formulations.

Finally, a few words on the limitations of our Lie-admissible and Lie-isotopic treatments
of irreversibility are in order. We have stressed in Section 1 that physics will never admit ﬁnal
theories. That is the fate also for our formulations. In fact, their most visible limitations
are due to the fact that the basic genounits, their genoproducts and other operations are
”single-valued,” namely, the result of genooperations are given by one single quantity.

Such a feature is today known to be eﬀective for irreversible classical and operator phys-
ical processes, but said feature is also known to be insuﬃcient for the representation of
biological structure, since the latter require not only clearly irreversible methods but also
a multi-valued generalization of the (single-valued) Lie-admissible and Lie-isotopic formula-
tions, whose construction has been already embrionically initiated via the hyperstructural
branch of hadronic mechanics [18-22].

It is hoped that serious scholars will participate with independent studies on the above,
as well as numerous other, basically open problems because, in the ﬁnal analysis, lack of
participation in basic advances is a gift of scientiﬁc priorities to others.

We concern ourselves with the self-induced charge currents in electromagnetic materials and some
related topics on its eﬀects in the present paper. The contribution of self-induced charge currents of
metamaterial media to photon eﬀective rest mass is brieﬂy discussed. We concentrate primarily on
the torque, which is caused by the interaction of self-induced charge currents in dilute plasma with
interstellar magnetic ﬁelds, acting on the torsion balance in the torsion balance experiment. It is
shown by our evaluation that the muons and alpha-particles in secondary cosmic rays will contribute
an eﬀective rest mass about 10−54 Kg to the photon, which is compared to the newly obtained upper
limit on photon rest mass in Luo’s rotating torsion balance experiment.

I. PHOTON EFFECTIVE REST MASS DUE TO SELF-INDUCED CHARGE CURRENT

In is well known that in some simple electromagnetic media such as electron plasma, superconducting media and
Lorentz dispersive materials (inside which the time-harmonic electromagnetic wave is propagating), the self-induced
charge current density J [1] is proportional to the magnetic vector potential A. Thus the interaction term µ0J · A in
eff c2
m2
the Lagrangian density is therefore transformed into an eﬀective mass term − 1
¯h2 A2 of electromagnetic ﬁelds [2],
2
which is analogous to the rest mass term in the Londons’ electromagnetics for superconductivity, Ginzberg-Landau
superconductivity theory and Higgs mechanism. Note that in these media, the magnetic permeability1 µ = 1, so it
is easy for us to obtain J (and hence the eﬀective rest mass of photon) by solving the equation of motion of charged
particles acted upon by electromagnetic waves. However, for some artiﬁcial composite electromagnetic metamaterials,
which are described by, e.g., the two time derivative Lorentz material (2TDLM) model (in which both the electric
permittivity and the magnetic permeability are of frequency dependence and therefore of complicated form) and some
uniaxially (or biaxially) anisotropic media with permittivity and permeability being tensors, the above formulation
may be not helpful in obtaining the eﬀective rest mass of electromagnetic ﬁelds. In these cases, however, we have
shown that the following formula [2]

m2
eﬀc4
¯h2 = (1 − n2)ω2,

which arises from the Einstein-de Broglie relation, can be applicable to the above problem. In the expression (1.1),
n, ¯h and c denote the optical refractive index, Planck’s constant and speed of light in a vacuum, respectively.

The two time derivative Lorentz material (2TDLM) model ﬁrst suggested by Ziolkowski and Auzanneau [3,4] is
a generalization of the standard Lorentz material model. Ziolkowski has shown that this type of 2TDLM medium
can be designed so that it allows communication signals to propagate in the medium at speeds exceeding the speed
of light in a vacuum without violating causality [5]. For these artiﬁcial metamaterials, the model encompasses the
permittivity and permeability material responses experimentally obtained [6]. The ˆx-directed polarization and ˆy-
directed magnetization ﬁelds in such materials would have the following forms [5]

So, the refractive index squared in the 2TDLM model reads

n2 (ω) = 1 + χe (ω) + χm (ω) + χe (ω) χm (ω) .

Thus it follows from (1.1) that the photon eﬀective rest mass squared in 2TDLM model is of the form

[χe (ω) + χm (ω) + χe (ω) χm (ω)] .

As an illustrative example, we apply Eq.(1.5) to the case of left-handed media, which is a kind of artiﬁcial compos-
ite metamaterials with negative refractive index in the microwave frequency region (109 Hz). More recently, this
medium captured considerable attention in various ﬁelds such as condensed matter physics, materials science, applied
electromagnetics and optics [6–11]. The most characteristic features of left-handed media are: (i) both the electric
permittivity ǫ and the magnetic permeability µ are negative; (ii) the Poynting vector and wave vector of electromag-
netic wave propagating inside it would be antiparallel, i.e., the wave vector k, the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic
ﬁeld H form a left-handed system; (iii) a number of peculiar electromagnetic and optical properties such as the reversal
of both the Doppler shift and the Cherenkov radiation, anomalous refraction, modiﬁed spontaneous emission rates
and even reversals of radiation pressure to radiation tension [7,8] arise. All these dramatically diﬀerent propagation
characteristics stem from the sign change of the group velocity. In what follows we calculate the photon eﬀective rest
mass squared by making use of Eq.(1.5) and the expressions

It should be emphasized that there is a diﬀerence in the deﬁnition of photon eﬀective rest mass between two types
of experimental schemes of testing photon mass2. In the discussion of wave dispersion and potential variations of the

speed of light with frequency, which are based on the Maxwellian equations (rather than the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian
density of interacting electromagnetic system), the eﬀective rest mass squared of photons is expressed by Eq.(1.9).
Historically, this problem has been discussed by many investigators, e.g., Feinberg who considered the possibility of
the variation of the speed of light with frequency in the sharply deﬁned optical and radio pulses from pulsars and took
into account in more detail the observed variation of arrival time with frequency for the radio waves attributed to
the interaction with interstellar electrons [14]. However, for those experimental schemes of testing photon rest mass,
which are based on the Hamiltonian density (rather than the Maxwellian equations), the eﬀective rest mass of photons
due to media dispersion (i.e., the interaction of wave with charged particles in environmental dilute plasma such as
the secondary cosmic rays) is two times that expressed in Eq.(1.9). The torsion balance experiment is just this type
of schemes, which will be considered in what follows.

II. EFFECTS OF SELF-INDUCED CHARGE CURRENTS IN THE TORSION BALANCE EXPERIMENT

magnetic dipole moment md; S in I = J · S denotes the area vector through which the electric current density vector
J penetrates; ~τ = md × B means that an electric-current loop with a magnetic dipole moment md, immersed in a
magnetic ﬁeld B, experiences a torque ~τ = md × B. Eqs.(2.6) means in the torsion balance experiment, a toroid coil
contains a loop of magnetic ﬂux Φ which acts as a dipole source ad of magnetic vector potential via ∇ × A = B with
the magnetic ﬁeld B within the toroid as the source term.

3This may be considered in two ways: (i) if the direction of M is assumed to be parallel to the third component of Cartesian
coordinate system, then the potentially non-vanishing components of B and H are also the third ones. It follows from the
Amp`ere’s law ∇ × H = Jfree with Jfree = 0 that H3 is constant, and H3 can be viewed as zero. So, according to the expression
B = µ0(H + M), we obtain B = µ0M; (ii) In accordance with Amp`ere’s circuital law, the magnetic induction B inside a long
solenoid with N circular loops carrying a current I in the region remote from the ends is axial, uniform and equal to µ0 times
the number of Amp`ere-turns per meter nI, i.e., B = µ0nI, where n = N
l with l being the solenoid length. Let S denote the
cross-section area of this long solenoid. The volume density of magnetic moments IS resulting from the carried current I is
M = (IS)nl
V with the solenoid volume V = Sl. This, therefore, means that the volume density of magnetic moments just equals
the number of Amp`ere-turns per meter nI, i.e., M = nI. So, we have B = µ0M .

Since we have discussed the related preliminary preparation for the eﬀects of self-induced charge currents, we think
the order of magnitude of its eﬀects in experiments (e.g., the extra torque due to the photon eﬀective mass acting on
the toroid in the torsion balance experiment) deserves evaluation.

Here we discuss the eﬀective rest mass of photon resulting from the self-induced charge currents in the torsion
balance experiments [15,16]. The self-induced charge current arises mainly from the two sources around us: (i)
muon (µ) component and alpha-particles in cosmic rays; (ii) decay daughter (alpha-particles) of radioactive radon gas

It is known that at the sea level, the current density of muon component in secondary cosmic rays is about

3) is the datum at the sea level. In the Luo’s rotating torsion
balance experiment whose total apparatus is located in their cave laboratory, on which the least thickness of the cover
is more than 40 m [15], it is reasonably believed that the muon density of cosmic rays in the vacuum chamber of Luo’s
experiment may be one or two orders of magnitude5 less than that at the sea level, and therefore the eﬀective rest
mass acquired by photons in the vacuum chamber of Luo’s torsion balance experiment may be about (0.6 ∼ 2)× 10−

It is believed that the air molecules in the vacuum chamber of torsion balance experiment cannot be ionized by the
1 in the dilute
alpha-particles of cosmic rays, because the mean free path of alpha-particle moving at about 107m · s−
2 Pa [15] is too large (more than 106 m)6. So, the air medium has nothing to
air with the pressure being only 10−
contribute to the eﬀective rest mass of photons. As far as the alpha-particle itself is concerned, it follows, from the
fact that at the sea level the alpha-particle number density in secondary cosmic rays is about one order of magnitude
54 Kg to photon rest mass.
less than that of muon, that the alpha-particle in cosmic rays itself contributes about 10−

4Since the mean distance of two muons in secondary cosmic rays at sea level is about 100 m, Lorentz’s mean-ﬁeld formulation
(Lorentz’s dispersion theory, Lorentz’s electron theory, 1895) is not applicable to the electromagnetic wave with wavelength
λ ≪ 100 m. So, the above eﬀective mass formula is no longer valid for this case (i.e., λ ≪ 100 m). In fact, the electromagnetic
wave with wavelength λ ≪ 100 m dose not acquire this eﬀective rest mass. But the ambient cosmic magnetic vector potentials
(interstellar magnetic ﬁelds) with low (or zero) frequencies will truly acquire this eﬀective rest mass.
5Readers may be referred to the following data of muon current density in underground cosmic rays: the muon current densities
are 10−4cm−2 · s−1 and 10−6cm−2 · s−1 at the equivalent water depth of 100 m and 1000 m under the ground, respectively.
6According to some handbooks, the free paths of alpha-particles in air (with pressure 105 Pa) are 2.5, 3.5, 4.6, 5.9, 7.4, 8.9,
10.6 cm, corresponding respectively to the energy 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 Mev. So, in the vacuum chamber with pressure
10−2 Pa in Luo’s experiment, the free path of alpha-particles (with energy much more than 10 Mev, even perhaps more than
100 Mev) in secondary cosmic rays is more than 107 times several cm, which means that the air molecules in the low-pressure
vacuum chamber cannot be easily ionized by the alpha-particles of cosmic rays.

Radon (86Rn) possesses the α-radioactivity. Generally speaking, the Rn density in room environment is 10−

3 or
so, which may be the same order of magnitude as particle density in secondary cosmic rays7, and the decay daughter
(alpha-particles) will therefore give rise to a photon eﬀective mass of about 10−

54 Kg.

8m−

Thus the eﬀective rest mass induced by muons and alpha-particles in secondary cosmic rays and radon gas can be
compared to the new upper limit (1.2 × 10−
54 Kg) obtained by Luo et al.
in their recent rotating torsion balance
experiment [15]. So, as far as the contribution of ions of cosmic rays to the photon rest mass is concerned, this upper
limit (1.2 × 10−
54 Kg) becomes just a critical value. We think Luo’s experimentally obtained upper limit is of much
interest and therefore deserves further experimental investigation to get a more precise upper limit on photon mass.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper,

i) it is veriﬁed that the expression (1.1), i.e., m2

eff c4
¯h2 = (1 − n2)ω2 can be applied to calculating the eﬀective rest mass
of photons in the artiﬁcial composite electromagnetic metamaterials with complicated permittivity and permeability.

ii) it is shown that the extra torque 2 µ0N e2

m ad × A by the self-induced charge currents will also acts upon the toroid
in the torsion balance experiment whose apparatus is immersed in the dilute plasma such as the cosmic rays and
radon gas. Here the photon eﬀective rest mass squared is µ2

The following diﬀerence between these two µ2

eﬀ should be pointed out: the theoretical mechanism of torsion balance
experiment lies in the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian (2.3) of interacting electromagnetic system, so, the eﬀective rest
mass squared of electromagnetic ﬁelds is µ2
. However, for those experimental schemes [14,17,18] of photon
rest mass stemming from the Amp`ere-Maxwell-Proca equation ∇ × B = µ0ǫ0
rather than µ2
tive rest mass squared of electromagnetic ﬁelds is µ2
. The so-called experimental
me
realizations stemming from the Amp`ere-Maxwell-Proca equation are as follows: pulsar test of a variation of the speed
of light with frequency [14]; geomagnetic limit on photon mass based on the analysis of satellite measurements of the
Earth’s ﬁeld [17]; experimental test of Amp`ere’s law at low temperature [18], etc.. In all these experimental schemes,
the eﬀective mass squared is µ2

new upper limit on photon rest mass obtained in Luo’s rotating torsion balance experiment.

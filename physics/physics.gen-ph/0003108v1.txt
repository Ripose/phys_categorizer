Introduction to new

Hierarchic Theory of Condensed Matter

A basically new hierarchic quantitative theory, general for solids

and liquids, has been developed.

It is assumed, that unharmonic oscillations of particles in any con-
densed matter lead to emergence of three-dimensional (3D) superpo-
sition of standing de Broglie waves of molecules, electromagnetic and
acoustic waves. Consequently, any condensed matter could be con-
sidered as a gas of 3D standing waves of corresponding nature. Our
approach uniﬁes and develops strongly the Einstein’s and Debye’s
models.

Collective excitations, like 3D standing de Broglie waves of molecules,

representing at certain conditions the mesoscopic molecular Bose con-
densate, were analyzed, as a background of hierarchic model of con-
densed matter.

The most probable de Broglie wave (wave B) length is deter-
mined by the ratio of Plank constant to the most probable impulse
of molecules, or by ratio of its most probable phase velocity to fre-
quency. The waves B are related to molecular translations (tr) and
librations (lb).

As the quantum dynamics of condensed matter does not follow in general
case the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the real most probable de
Broglie wave length can exceed the classical thermal de Broglie wave length and
the distance between centers of molecules many times.

This makes possible the atomic and molecular Bose condensation in solids
and liquids at temperatures, below boiling point. It is one of the most important
results of new theory, which we have conﬁrmed by computer simulations on
examples of water and ice.

Four strongly interrelated new types of quasiparticles (collective excita-

tions) were introduced in our hierarchic model:

1. Eﬀectons (tr and lb), existing in ”acoustic” (a) and ”optic” (b) states

represent the coherent clusters in general case;

2. Convertons, corresponding to interconversions between tr and lb types of

the eﬀectons (ﬂickering clusters);

3. Transitons are the intermediate [a ⇋ b] transition states of the tr and lb

eﬀectons;

4. Deformons are the 3D superposition of IR electromagnetic or acoustic

waves, activated by transitons and convertons.

Primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are formed by 3D superposition of the
most probable standing de Broglie waves of the oscillating ions, atoms or

2

molecules. The volume of eﬀectons (tr and lb) may contain from less than one,
to tens and even thousands of molecules. The ﬁrst condition means validity
of classical approximation in description of the subsystems of the eﬀectons.
The second one points to quantum properties of coherent clusters due to
molecular Bose condensation on mesoscopic spatial scale.

The liquids are semiclassical systems because their primary (tr) eﬀectons
contain less than one molecule and primary (lb) eﬀectons - more than one
molecule. The solids are quantum systems totally because both kind of their
primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are molecular Bose condensates. These conse-
quences of our theory are conﬁrmed by computer calculations.

The 1st order [gas → liquid] transition is accompanied by strong decreasing
of rotational (librational) degrees of freedom due to emergence of primary (lb)
eﬀectons and [liquid → solid] transition - by decreasing of translational degrees
of freedom due to Bose-condensation of primary (tr) eﬀectons.

In the general case the eﬀecton can be approximated by par-
allelepiped with edges corresponding to de Broglie waves length in
three selected directions (1, 2, 3), related to the symmetry of the
molecular dynamics. In the case of isotropic molecular motion the
eﬀectons’ shape may be approximated by cube.

The edge-length of primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) can be considered

as the ”parameter of order”.

The in-phase oscillations of molecules in the eﬀectons correspond to the
eﬀecton’s (a) - acoustic state and the counterphase oscillations correspond to
their (b) - optic state. States (a) and (b) of the eﬀectons diﬀer in potential
energy only, however, their kinetic energies, impulses and spatial dimensions -
are the same. The b-state of the eﬀectons has a common feature with Fr¨olich’s
polar mode.

The (a → b) or (b → a) transition states of the primary eﬀectons
(tr and lb), deﬁned as primary transitons, are accompanied by a
change in molecule polarizability and dipole moment without density
ﬂuctuations. At this case they lead to absorption or radiation of IR
photons, respectively.

Superposition (interception) of three internal standing IR pho-
tons of diﬀerent directions (1,2,3) - forms primary electromagnetic
deformons (tr and lb).

On the other hand, the [lb⇋ tr] convertons and secondary transitons are
accompanied by the density ﬂuctuations, leading to absorption or radiation of
phonons.

Superposition resulting from interception of standing phonons in three direc-

tions (1,2,3), forms secondary acoustic deformons (tr and lb).

Correlated collective excitations of primary and secondary eﬀectons and
deformons (tr and lb), localized in the volume of primary tr and lb electromag-
netic deformons, lead to origination of macroeﬀectons, macrotransitons
and macrodeformons (tr and lb respectively).

3

Correlated simultaneous excitations of tr and lb macroeﬀectons in the vol-
ume of superimposed tr and lb electromagnetic deformons lead to origination
of supereﬀectons.

In turn, the coherent excitation of both:

tr and lb macrodeformons and
macroconvertons in the same volume means creation of superdeformons. Su-
perdeformons are the biggest (cavitational) ﬂuctuations, leading to microbub-
bles in liquids and to local defects in solids.

Total number of quasiparticles of condensed matter equal to 4!=24,
reﬂects all of possible combinations of the four basic ones [1-4], intro-
duced above. This set of collective excitations in the form of ”gas” of
3D standing waves of three types: de Broglie, acoustic and electro-
magnetic - is shown to be able to explain virtually all the properties
of all condensed matter.

The important positive feature of our hierarchic model of matter is that it
does not need the semi-empiric intermolecular potentials for calculations, which
are unavoidable in existing theories of many body systems. The potential energy
of intermolecular interaction is involved indirectly in dimensions and stability
of quasiparticles, introduced in our model.

The main formulae of theory are the same for liquids and solids
and include following experimental parameters, which take into ac-
count their diﬀerent properties:

[1]- Positions of (tr) and (lb) bands in oscillatory spectra;
[2]- Sound velocity;
[3]- Density;
[4]- Refraction index (extrapolated to the inﬁnitive wave length of

photon).

The knowledge of these four basic parameters at the same temperature and
pressure makes it possible using our computer program, to evaluate more than
300 important characteristics of any condensed matter. Among them are such
as: total internal energy, kinetic and potential energies, heat-capacity and ther-
mal conductivity, surface tension, vapor pressure, viscosity, coeﬃcient of self-
diﬀusion, osmotic pressure, solvent activity, etc. Most of calculated parameters
are hidden, i.e. inaccessible to direct experimental measurement.

The new interpretation and evaluation of Brillouin light scattering and
M¨ossbauer eﬀect parameters may also be done on the basis of hierarchic the-
ory. Mesoscopic scenarios of turbulence, superconductivity and superﬂuidityare
elaborated.

Some original aspects of water in organization and large-scale dynamics of
biosystems - such as proteins, DNA, microtubules, membranes and regulative
role of water in cytoplasm, cancer development, quantum neurodynamics, etc.
have been analyzed in the framework of Hierarchic theory.

Computerized veriﬁcation of our Hierarchic concept of matter on
examples of water and ice is performed, using special computer pro-
gram: Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP, copy-
right, 1997, Kaivarainen). The new optoacoustic device (CAMP),

4

based on this program, with possibilities much wider, than that of IR,
Raman and Brillouin spectrometers, has been proposed (see URL: http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk).

This is the ﬁrst theory able to predict all known experimental
temperature anomalies for water and ice. The conformity between
theory and experiment is very good even without any adjustable pa-
rameters. The hierarchic concept creates a bridge between micro-
and macro- phenomena, dynamics and thermodynamics, liquids and
solids in terms of quantum physics.

==============================================================

1. Turbulence. General description

The type of ﬂow when particles move along the straight trajectory

without mixing with adjoining layers, is termed laminar ﬂow.

If the layers of the liquid of the laminar ﬂow are moving relative to
each other at diﬀerent velocities, then the forces of internal friction
(Ff r) or viscosity forces originate between them:

Ff r = η(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∆v

∆d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∆v

S,

(1)

where: ∆v is relative liquid layer velocity; S is the contact surface; η is dynamic
viscosity;
layers.

∆d(cid:12)(cid:12) is the module of velocity gradient directed to the surface of

Near the walls of a straight tube the velocity of laminar ﬂow is

(cid:12)(cid:12)

equal to zero and in the center of the tube it is maximum.

The relation between the layer velocity and its distance from cen-

tral axes of the tube (r) is parabolic:

v(r) = v0(cid:18)1 −

r2
a2

t(cid:19)

(2)

where: at is tube radius; v0 is the velocity of the liquid on the central
axis, depending on the diﬀerence of pressure at the ends of the tube:

as follows:

∆P = P1 − P2

v0 =

P1 − P2

4ηl

a2
t

5

(3)

(4)

where: l

is tube length and η is dynamic viscosity.

The ﬂux of liquid, i.e. the volume of liquid ﬂowing over the cross-section of

the tube during a time unit is determined by the Poiseuille formula:

Q =

(P1 − P2)πa2
t

8ηl

(5)

This formula has been used frequently for estimation of dynamic viscosity η.

The corresponding mass of ﬂowing liquid is equal:

and corresponding kinetic energy:

m = ρQ

Tk =

ρ

Qv2
0

where: ρ is density of liquid.

The work of internal friction force is:

(6)

(7)

A = −4ηv0lQ/ρR2

In the case of the laminar movement of a spherical body relative to liquid the
force of internal friction (viscosity force) is determined by the Stokes law :

Ff r = 6πavη,

(8)

where: (a) is the radius of sphere and v is its relative velocity.

As a result of liquid velocity (v) and/or the characteristic dimension (a)

increasing, the laminar type of liquid ﬂow could change to the turbulent one.

This begins at certain values of the dimensionless Reynolds number:

R = ρvca/η = vca/ν,

(9)

where: ρ is liquid density; vc is characteristic (average) ﬂow velocity; ν = η/ρ

is kinematic viscosity of liquid.

For a round tube with radius (a) the critical value of R is about 1000. A
turbulent type of ﬂow is accompanied by rapid irregular pulsations of liquid
velocity and pressure, representing a kind of self-organization.

In the case of nonstationary movement, the ﬂow can be character-

ized by two additional dimensionless parameters like:

Strouhal number:

6

S = vcτ /a

where: τ is the characteristic time of velocity (vc) pulsations;
and March number :

where: vs is sound velocity in liquid.

M = vc/vs

2. Mesoscopic mechanism of turbulence

(10)

(11)

The physical scenario of transition from a laminar ﬂow to a turbulent one
is still unclear. It is possible to propose the mechanism of this transition based
on mesoscopic concept of matter.

Let us start from the assumption that in the case of laminar ﬂow, the thick-
ness of parallel layers is determined by the thickness of primary electromagnetic
deformons (translational ∼ 5 · 105˚A and librational ∼ 105˚A), equal to linear
dimensions of corresponding macrodeformons.

The total internal energy and the internal pressure of neighboring layers are

not equal.

The surface between such layers can be characterized by corresponding sur-
face tension [σ(r)]. Surface tension prevents mixing between layers with diﬀerent
laminar ﬂow velocities.

According to our model the thickness of the two outer borders of each layer
(skin-surface) is determined by the eﬀective linear dimensions of primary (tr
and lib) eﬀectons [ltr,lb ∼ (3 − 15)˚A] related to the corresponding most probable
wave B length (λtr,lb) of molecules in liquid (see eq. 11.30):

ltr,lb = (Vef /V 2/3
ef )

(12)

Decreasing of ltr,lb, depending on most probable impulse of liquid molecules,
as a result of increased ﬂow velocity [v1(r)] see eq. (13) and/or temperature
elevation in accordance with our theory of surface tension (see eq. 11.33 of [1]
or [3]), leads to reducing of σ(r). In turn, this eﬀect strongly decreases the work
of cavitational ﬂuctuations, i.e. the bubbles formation (27) and increases their
concentration (29). These bubbles lead to mixing of laminar layers, the
instability of laminar ﬂow and its changing to a turbulent type.

The critical ﬂow velocity: vc = v1(r) is determined by the critical librational

wave B length:

λ1,2,3

lb = h/m ·(cid:2) (cid:0) v1,2,3

gr

(cid:1)lb + v1(r) (cid:3)

corresponding to the condition (6.6) of liquid-gas ﬁrst order phase transition:

4π

(λ(1) · λ(2) · λ(3))lib/(V0/N0)(cid:21) ≤ 1

(14)

where: m is molecular mass; v1,2,3

is the most probable librational group
velocity of molecules of liquid in selected directions (1, 2, 3); v1(r) is the ﬂow
velocity of a liquid layer in the tube at the distance (r) from the central axes of
the tube (2).

Increasing of v1(r) at r → 0 decreases λ1

and (14). The value of λ1
(νa

lb is also related to phase velocity (va

(16)

where:

is the frequency of (a ⇔ b)lb transitions of the primary librational eﬀecton of
a ﬂowing liquid determined by librational band wave number (˜ν1
p )lb in the
oscillatory spectra.

It was calculated earlier for water under stationary conditions, that the ele-
vation of temperature from 00 to 1000C till the phase transition condition (14),
is accompanied by the increase in (vgr)lb from (1.1 to 4.6) · 103cm/s (Fig. 12b
of [1]).

This means that at 300C, when (vgr)lb ≃ 2·103cm/s, the critical ﬂow velocity
v1(r), necessary for mechanical boiling of water (condition 14) should be about
2.5m/s.

The reduced number of primary librational eﬀectons (Nef ) in the volume
D ) of primary electromagnetic deformons (tr and lib) also increases with

(V M
temperature and/or ﬂow velocity:

(cid:0) Nef (cid:1)D

tr,lb =(cid:20) Pa + Pb

Z

nef · V M

D (cid:21)

(17)

The reduced number of primary transitons (Nt) has a similar dependence on T
and v1(r), due to increasing of nef , and V M

D as far:

(cid:0) Nt (cid:1)D

tr,lb =(cid:0) Nef (cid:1)D

tr,lb

8

(18)

The analysis of eq.(15) predicts that at T = const an increase in v1(r) must be
accompanied by the low-frequency shift of the librational band: ˜ν(1)
lib ≃ 700cm−1
and/or by the decrease in sound velocity (va
ph)lb (eq.2.74 of [1]) in the direction
of ﬂow.

It follows also from our mesoscopic theory that these changes should be
accompanied by a rise in dynamic viscosity (11.45 of [1] or [3]) due to increased
structural factor (Tkin/Utot).

Turbulent pulsations of ﬂow velocity (∆v) originate under developed turbu-

lence conditions:

∆v = vtur = v − v

where: ¯v is average ﬂow velocity and (v) is instant ﬂow velocity.

The frequencies of large-scale pulsations have the order of:

ν = v/λ,

(19)

(20)

where: λ is the main scale of pulsations.

λ can correlate with the dimensions of electromagnetic deformons and can
be determined by the transverse convection rate, depending on the bubbles
dimensions.

The pulsations of ﬂow velocity (∆v) can result from the
a) mixing of parallel layers with diﬀerent ﬂow velocity and
b) ﬂuctuation of viscosity force (eq. 8) due to ﬂuctuations in bub-
bles radius and concentration, as well as density, viscosity and thermal
conductivity;

c) movements and emergence of the bubbles as a result of the

Archimedes force.

The bubbles have two opposite types of inﬂuence on instant velocity. The

layer mixing eﬀect induced by them can increase ﬂow velocity.

On the other hand, the bubbles can simultaneously decrease ﬂow velocity

due to enhanced internal friction.

In the case of developed turbulence with diﬀerent scales of pulsations it is

reasonable to introduce the characteristic Reynolds number:

Rλ = vturλ/νtur

(21)

where: λ is a scale of pulsations; vtur is the velocity of pulsation and νtur =
(η/ρ)tur characteristic kinematic viscosity.

The ratio between turbulent kinematic viscosity (νtur) and a laminar one (ν)
is related to the corresponding Reynolds numbers like (Landau, Lifshits, 1988):

9

νtur

ν

∼

R
Rtur

One can see from (21) that it means:

vtur · λ ∼ const

(22)

(23)

Based on dimension relations turbulent kinematic viscosity can be expressed as
follows:

and energy dissipation as:

νtur ∼ ∆v · l ∼ vλ · λ

ǫdis ∼ νtur(vtur/λ)2 ∼

v3
tur
λ

This expression leads to the Kholmogorov-Obuchov law:

vtur ∼ (ǫdisλ)1/3

(24)

(25)

(26)

Large-scale pulsations correspond to high λ values and low νtur values. i.e. high
characteristic turbulence Reynolds numbers (see 21).

According to our model the maximum energy dissipation occurs in the vol-

ume of superdeformons (or supertransitons).

Mechanically induced boiling under conditions of turbulence (eqs. 13
and 14) is accompanied by the emergence of gas bubbles related to the increased
superdeformons probability and decreased surface tension between layers.

Critical bubble creation work (W ) is strongly dependent on inter- layer sur-

face tension (σ). A general classical theory (Nesis, 1973) gives:

W =

4
3

πa2σ =

16πσ3

3(P − Pext)2

where:

P = Pext +

2σ
a

= Pa=∞ · exp(cid:18)−

2σVe

akT (cid:19)

(27)

(28)

P is the internal gas pressure in a bubble with radius (a); Ve is the volume of
liquid occupied by one molecule.

The bubbles quantity (Nb) has an exponential dependence on W :

10

Nb = exp(cid:18)−

W

kT(cid:19)

(29)

One can see from our mesoscopic theory of surface tension (eqs. 11.31 - 11.33 of
[1]; [3] and eq.12) that under mechanical boiling conditions the skin-surface
l → (V0/N0)1/3 and qs → 1, the interlayer surface tension (σ)
thickness (12) :
tends to zero, W decreases and Nb increases.

We can conclude that the mesoscopic scenario of mechanical boil-
ing presented here can provide a background for elaboration of a
quantitative physical theory of turbulence and other hydrodynamic
instabilities like Taylor’s and Benar’s ones.

3. Superﬂuidity. General description

superﬂuidityhas been revealed for two liquids only: helium iso-
4He with boson’s properties (S = 0) and 3He with fermion
topes:
properties (S = 1/2). The interactions between the atoms of these
liquids is very weak. It will be shown below that the values of nor-
mal sound velocity at temperatures higher than those of second order
phase transition (λ-point) are lower than the most probable thermal
velocities of the atoms of these liquids.

The ﬁrst theories of superﬂuidity were proposed by Landau (1941)

and Feynman (1953).

First order phase transition [gas → liquid] occurs at 4.22K.
Second order phase transition, when superﬂuidity originates, 4He
→ He II takes place at Tλ = 2.17K (Pext = 1 atm.). This transition is
accompanied by:

a) heat capacity jump to higher values;
b) abruptly increased thermal conductivity;
c) markedly decreased cavitational ﬂuctuations and bubbles in liq-

uid helium.

For explanation of experimental data Landau supposed that at T < Tλ the

He II consists of two components:

- the superﬂuidity component with relative fraction of density ρS/ρ, increas-
ing from zero at T = Tλ to 1 at T = 0 K. The properties of this component are
close to those of an ideal liquid with a potential type of ﬂow. The entropy of
this component is zero and it does not manifest the viscous friction on ﬂowing
through narrow capillaries;

- the normal component with density

ρn = ρ − ρs

(30)

11

decreasing from 1 at T = Tλ to zero at T = 0 K. This component behaves
as a usual viscous liquid which exhibits dumping of the oscillating disk in He
II. Landau considered this component to be a gas of two types of excitations:
phonons and rotons.

The hydrodynamics of normal and superﬂuid components of He II are char-

acterized by two velocities: normal (vn) and superﬂuid one:

vsf = (/m)∇ϕ

(31)

where ∇ϕ ∼ ksf = 1/Lsf is a phase of Bose-condensate wave function - see eq.
36.

As a result of two types of hydrodynamic velocities and densities, the corre-

sponding 2 types of sound waves propagate in the volume of He II.

The ﬁrst sound (U1) is determined by the usual formula valid for normal

condensed matter:

U 2

1 = (∂P/∂ρ)S

(32)

In this case density oscillations spread in the form of phonons.

The second sound (U2) is related to oscillations of temperature and entropy

(S):

U 2

2 = ρST S2/cρn

(33)

In normal condensed media the temperature oscillation fade at the distance of
the order of wave length.

Landau considered the second sound as density waves in the gas of quasi-

particles: rotons and phonons.

The third sound (U3) propagates in the thin surface ﬁlms of He II in
the form of ”ripplons”, i.e. quantum capillary waves related to the isothermal
oscillations of the superﬂuid component.

U3 = (ρS/ρS) · d ·

∂E
∂d

(1 + T S/L),

(34)

where: (¯ρS/ρS) is the relative density of superﬂuid component averaged in the
thickness of the ﬁlm (d); E is the potential of Van- der-Waals interactions of
4He atoms with the bottom surface; L is evaporation heat.

The fourth sound (U4) propagates in He II, located in very narrow capillaries,
when the length of quasiparticles (phonons and rotons) free run is compatible
or bigger than the diameter of these capillaries or pores.

The hydrodynamic velocity (vn) of the normal component under such con-

ditions is zero and ρn/ρ ≪ ρsf /ρ:

12

U 2

4 = (ρS/ρ)U 2

1 + (ρn/ρ)U 2

2 ≃ (ρS/ρ)U 2
1

(35)

In accordance with Bose-Einstein statistics, a decrease in temperature, when
T → Tλ, leads to condensation of bosons in a minimum energy state.

This process results in the origination of a superﬂuid component of He II

with the coherent thermal and hydrodynamic movement of atoms.

Coherence means that this movement can be described by the single wave

function:

ψ = ρ1/2

S

· eiϕ

(36)

The movement of the superﬂuid component is potential as far its velocity (~vsf )
is determined by eq.31 and:

rot vsf = 0

(37)

Vortex ﬁlaments in He II

When the rotation velocity of a cylindrical vessel containing He
II is high enough, then the emergency of so-called vortex ﬁlaments
becomes thermodynamically favorable. The ﬁlament is formed by
the superﬂuid component of He II in such a way that their impulse
of movement decreases the total energy of He II in a rotating vessel.
The shape of ﬁlaments in this case is like a straight rod and their thickness
is of the order of atom’s dimensions, increasing with lowering the temperature
at T < Tλ.

Vortex ﬁlaments are continuous. They are closed or limited within the
boundaries of a liquid. For each surface surrounding a vortex ﬁlament the
condition (37) is valid.

The values of velocity of circulation around the axis of ﬁlaments are deter-

mined (Landau, 1941) as follows:

I vsf dl = 2πrvsf = 2πκ

and

vsf = κ/r

13

(38)

(39)

Increasing the radius of circulation (r) leads to decreased circulation velocity
(vsf ). Substituting vsf in eq.31, we obtain:

I vsf dl =



m

∆Φ,

(40)

where: ∆Φ = n2π is a phase change as a result of circulation, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . is
the integer number.

Comparing (40) and (38) gives:

κ = n



m

(41)

It has been shown that only curls with n = 1 are thermodynamically stable.
Taking this into account, we have from (39) and (41):

r = n



mvsf

(42)

An increase in the angle frequency of rotation of the cylinder con-
taining He II results in the increased density distribution of vortex
ﬁlaments on the cross-section of the cylinder.

As a result of interaction between the ﬁlament and the normal
component of He II, the ﬁlaments move in the rotating cylinder with
normal liquid.

The ﬂow of He II through the capillaries can be accompanied by

emergence of vortex ﬁlaments.

In ring-shaped vessels the circulation of closed vortex ﬁlaments
is stable. Stability is related to the quantum pattern of circulation
change (eqs. 38 and 41).

Let us consider now the phenomena of superﬂuidityin He II in the

framework of our mesoscopic concept.

4. Mesoscopic scenario of superﬂuidity

It will be shown below how our mesoscopic model (Table 1) can
be used to explain He II properties, its excitation spectrum (Fig. 1),
increased heat capacity at λ-point and the vortex ﬁlaments formation.
We assume here, that the formulae obtained earlier for internal
energy (Utot − eq.4.3), viscosity (eqs. 11.48, 11.49 and 11.55 of [1] or
see [3]), thermal conductivity (eq. 11.37), vapor pressure (eq. 11.26)
remain valid for both components of He II.

The theory proposed by Landau (Lifshits, Pitaevsky, 1978) quali-
tatively explains only the lower branch (a) in the spectrum (Fig. 1)
as a result of phonons and rotons excitation.

14

But the upper branch (b) points that the real process is more
complicated and needs introduction of other quasiparticles and ex-
cited states for its explanation.

Our mesoscopic model of superﬂuidity interrelates the lower branch
with the ground acoustic (a) state of primary eﬀectons in liquid 4He
and the upper branch with their excited optical (b) state.
In ac-
cordance with our model, the dissipation and viscosity friction (see
section 11.6) arise in the normal component of He II due to ther-
mal phonons radiated and absorbed in the course of the ¯b → ¯a and
¯a → ¯b transitions of secondary eﬀectons correspondingly, symbatic to
macrodeformons excitation.

Fig. 1. Excitation spectrum of liquid 4He from neutron scat-
tering measurements (March and Parrinello, 1982). Spectrum is
characterized by two branches, corresponding to (a) and (b) states
of the primary eﬀectons according to the mesoscopic model.

Landau described the minimum in the region of λ-point using the expression:

E = ∆0 +

(P − P0)2

2m∗

,

(43)

where ∆0 and P0 are the energy and impulse of liquid 4He at λ-point (Fig. 1)
and m∗ = 0.16m is the eﬀective mass of the 4He atom (mHe = 4·1.44·10−24g =
5.76 · 10−24g). The eﬀective mass m∗ can be determined experimentally.

Feynman (1953) explained the same part of the excitation spectra by the

nonmonotonic behavior of the structure factor S(k) and the formula:

15

where:

E = ω =

2k2
2mS

=

2

2mL2S

k = 1/L = 2π/λ

(44)

(45)

is the wave number of neutron interacting with liquid 4He.

Our mesoscopic model allows to unify Landau’s and Feynman’s approaches.
The total energy of de Broglie wave either free or as part of condensed matter
can be expressed through its amplitude squared (A2), or eﬀective mass (m∗) in
the following manner (see 2.45 and 2.46):

Etot = Tk + V = mvgrvph =

2
2mA2 =

2

2m∗L2

(46)

where vgr and vph are the most probable group and phase velocities.

In accordance with our model (eq. 2.46a), the structural factor S(k) is equal

to the kinetic (Tk) to total (Etot) energy ratio of wave B:

S = Tk/Etot = A2/L2 = m∗/m

where:

Tk = P 2/2m =



2mL

(47)

(48)

Combining (46), (47) and (48), we obtain the following set of equation for the
energy of 4He at transition λ-point:

∆0 = 2

(49)

These approximate formulae for the total energy of liquid 4He made it possible
to estimate the most probable wave B length, forming the primary librational
(or rotational eﬀectons) at λ-point:

λ0 =

h
mv0
gr

= 2πL0 = 2πA0(cid:0) m/m∗ (cid:1)1/2

where the critical amplitude of wave B:

,

(50)

16

A0 = (cid:18) 1

2mE0(cid:19)1/2

(51)

can be calculated from the experimental E0 values (Fig.1). Putting in (51) and
(50) the available data:

∆0 = E0 = kB · 8.7K = 1.2 · 10−15 erg;

the mass of atom: m(4He) = 5.76 · 10−24g and (m∗/m) = 0.16, we obtain:

λ0

∼= 14 · 10−8cm = 14˚A

(52)

the corresponding most probable group velocity of 4He atoms is: v0
103cm/s.

gr = 8.16 ·

It is known from the experiment that the volume occupied by one atom of
liquid 4He is equal: v(4He) = 46˚A3/atom. The edge length of the corresponding
cubic volume is:

From (52) and (53) we can calculate the number of 4He atoms in the volume

l =(cid:0) v4He (cid:1)1/3

= 3.58˚A

(53)

of primary librational (rotational) eﬀecton at λ-point:

n0

V =

Vef
v4He

=

(9/4π)λ0

l3

= 43 atoms

(54)

One edge of such an eﬀecton contains (43)1/3 ∼= 3.5 atoms of liquid 4He.

We must take into account, that these parameters can be lower than the
real ones as in above simple calculations we did not consider the contribution of
secondary eﬀectons, transitons and deformons to total internal energy (see eq.
4.3).

On the other hand, in accordance with the mesoscopic model, the conditions
of the maximum stability of primary eﬀectons correspond to the integer number
of particles in the edge of these eﬀectons (see Chapter 6 and Fig. 7a of [1] or
Fig.4a of [2]).

Consequently, we have to assume that the true number of 4He atoms forming
V = 64. It means that the edge of

a primary eﬀecton at λ-point is equal to n0
cube as the eﬀecton shape approximation contains q0 = 4 atoms of 4He:

n0
e = (n0

V )1/3 = 641/3 = 4

(56)

17

The primary librational eﬀectons of such a type may correspond to rotons in-
troduced by Landau to explain the high heat capacity of He II.

The thermal impulses of 4He atoms in these coherent clusters can totally
compensate each other and the resulting impulse of primary eﬀectons is equal
to zero. Further decline in temperature gives rise to dimensions of primary
eﬀectons. The most stable of them contain in their ribs the integer number of
helium atoms:

q = q0 + n

(56a)

where: n = 1, 2, 3 . . .
V and n0

λ0, n0

e can be calculated more accurately using eqs. (2.60) and
(3.5) of [1], if the required experimental data on oscillatory spectroscopy and
sound velocimetry are available.

5. Superﬂuidity as a hierarchic self-organization process

Let us consider now the consequence of the phenomena observed
in 4He in the course of temperature decline to explain Fig. 1 in the
framework of mesoscopic model:

1. In accordance with our model lowering the temperature till
the 4.2 K and gas-liquid ﬁrst order phase transition occurs under
condition (6.6). This condition means that the most probable wave
B length of atoms related to their rotations or librations starts to
exceed the average distance between 4He atoms in a liquid phase:

λ = h/mvgr ≥ 3.58˚A

(57)

The corresponding value of the most probable group velocity is

vgr ≤ 3.2 · 104cm/s.

The translational thermal impulses of particles are usually bigger and
waves B length smaller than those related to librations. In accordance
with our model of ﬁrst order phase transitions (Section 6.2 of [1]), this
fact determines the diﬀerence in the temperatures of [gas → liquid]
and [liquid → solid] transitions.

The freezing of liquid 4He occurs at a suﬃciently high pressure
of ∼ 25 atm only and means the emergency of primary translational
eﬀectons. A pressure increase as well as the drop in temperature
declines the impulses between particles and stimulates distant Van
der Waals interaction between them, responsible for coherent clusters
formation.

18

In normal component of liquid 4He II like in a usual liquid at
T > 0 K, the existence of primary and secondary eﬀectons, convertons,
transitons and deformons is possible. The contributions of each of
these quasiparticles determine total internal energy (eq. 4.3 of [1, 2]),
kinetic and potential energies (eqs. 4.33 and 4.36 of [1, 2]), viscosity
(11.45), thermal conductivity (11.35), vapor pressure (11.26) of [1],
paper [3] and many other parameters.

We assume that the lower branch in the excitation spectrum of
Fig. 1 reﬂects the (a) state and the upper branch the (b) state of
primary (lb and tr) eﬀectons.

2. Decreasing the temperature to λ-point: Tλ = 2.17K is accom-
panied by the condition (55), which stimulates Bose-condensation
of atoms, increasing the dimensions of primary eﬀectons as well as
Bose-condensation of secondary eﬀectons with nonzero resulting im-
pulse. This leads to emergency of primary polyeﬀectons superﬂuid
subsystem due to distant Van der Waals interactions and Joseph-
son junctions between neighboring eﬀectons. It is accompanied by
the (a)-states probability jump-way increasing (Pa → 1) and that of
(b)-states decreasing (Pb → 0). Probability of primary and secondary
¯Pd = ¯Pa · ¯Pb) decreases correspondingly. In
deformons (Pd = Pa · Pb;
the excitation spectrum (Fig.1) these processes are displayed as the
tendency of (b)-branch to (a)-branch due to degeneration of b-branch
at very law temperature.

Like in the theory of 2nd order phase transitions proposed by Lan-
dau (Landau and Lifshits, 1976), we can introduce here the parameter
of order as:

η = 1 − κ = 1 −

Pa − Pb
Pa + Pb

(58)

where: κ = Pa−Pb
Pa+Pb

is an equilibrium parameter.

One can see that at Pa = Pb, the equilibrium parameter κ = 0 and

η = 1 (the system is far from 2nd order phase transition).

On the other hand, at conditions of phase transition: T → Tλ when

Pb → 0, κ → 1 and parameter of order (η) tends to zero.

According to Landau’s theory, the equality of his speciﬁc param-
eter of order to zero is a criterion of 2nd order phase transition. As
usual, this transition is followed by a decrease in structural symmetry
with a decline in temperature.

The important point of our scenario of superﬂuidityis the state-
ment that the leftward shift of (a ⇔ b) equilibrium of the primary
eﬀectons (tr and lb) becomes stable starting from Tλ due to their
polymerization ”side by side”. This process of Bose-condensation,
including conversion of secondary eﬀectons to primary ones, diﬀers
from condensation of an ideal Bose-gas described by eq. (1.26). Such

19

kind of Bose-condensation means the enhancement of the concentra-
tion of (a)-state of primary eﬀectons with lower energy, related to de-
generation of the all others. The polymerization of primary eﬀectons
in He II gives rise to macroscopically long ﬁlament-like (or chain-like)
polyeﬀectons. This process can be considered as self-organization on
macroscopic scale. These ﬁlament-like polyeﬀectons, representing su-
perﬂuid component, can form closed circles or three-dimensional (3D)
isotropic networks in a vessel with He II.

The remnant fraction of liquid represent normal fraction of He II.

Polyeﬀectons are characterized by the dynamic equilibrium: [assembly ⇔ deassembly].

Temperature decrease and pressure increase have to shift this equi-
librium to the left, increasing the surface of the primary eﬀectons
side-by-side interaction and number of Josephson junctions.

The probability of tunneling between coherent clusters increases

also correspondingly.

The relative movement (sliding) of ﬂexible ”snake-like” polyeﬀec-
tons occurs without phonons excitation in the volumes of IR defor-
mons, equal to that of macrodeformons. Just macrodeformons ex-
citation is responsible for dissipation and viscosity in normal liquids
(see section 11.6).

The absence of macrodeformons excitation, related to polyeﬀec-
tons emergency, explains the superﬂuidity phenomenon according to
our model.

Breaking of symmetry in a three-dimensional polyeﬀecton network and its
violation can be induced by external ﬁelds, like the gravitational gradient, me-
chanical perturbation and surface eﬀects.
It is possible as far the coherent
polyeﬀecton system is highly cooperative and interaction between individual
eﬀectons as 3D standing waves is small.

In rotating cylindrical vessel, ﬁlament-like polyeﬀectons originate from 3D
isotropic net and they tend to be oriented along the cylinder with their own ro-
tation round their own axis in the direction opposite to that of cylinder rotation.
In accordance with our model, this phenomenon represents the vortex ﬁlaments
in He II discussed above. The radius of the ﬁlaments (42) is determined by
the group velocity of the coherent 4He atoms, which form part of the primary
eﬀectons(vgr = vsf ). The numerical value of vgr must be equal to or less than
6 · 103cm/s, this corresponding to conditions (55 and 56). At T → 0, vgr de-
creases and the ﬁlament radius (42) increases to reach the values corresponding
to vmin
gr = v0 determined by the zero-point oscillations of 4He atoms. Under
these conditions the aggregation or polymerization of translational primary ef-
fectons in (a)-state can occur, leading to liquid-solid phase transition in 4He.

The self-organization of highly cooperative coherent polyeﬀectons in λ-point
and (a⇋ b) equilibrium leftward shift should be accompanied by a heat capacity
jump.

The mechanism, leading to stabilization of (a)- state of primary eﬀectons
as the ﬁrst stage of their polymerization, is a formation of coherent super-

20

clusters from primary eﬀectons without direct contacts. Stabilization of (a)
states in superclusters could be resulted from macroscopic self-organization
of matter in the volume of electromagnetic IR deformon due to distant Van der
Waals interaction and Vibro-gravitational interaction, introduced in our theory
between primary eﬀectons (see section 10.4). These interactions between acous-
tic (a) states of the eﬀectons are more eﬀective, than between optic (b) states.
They minimize the potential energy of the system and increase the probability
of macroscopic Bose-condensation.

The successive mechanisms of super-clusterization and polymer-
ization of primary eﬀectons could be responsible for second order
phase transitions, leading to emergency of superﬂuidity and super-
conductivity.

The second sound in such a model can be attributed to phase velocity in a
system of polyeﬀectons or superclusters. The propagation of the second sound
through chain polyeﬀectons or superclusters should be accompanied by their
elastic deformation and [assembly ⇔ disassembly] equilibrium oscillations.

The third sound can be also related to the elastic deformation of polyeﬀec-
tons and equilibrium constant oscillations of superclusters, but in the surface
layer with properties diﬀerent from those in bulk volume. In accordance with
the mesoscopic theory, such a diﬀerence in surface and volume parameters is
responsible (see eq.11.31-11.33) of [1] and [3] for surface tension (σ) in He II
and its jump at λ-point. this increase in σ explain also the disappearance of
cavitational bubbles at T < Tλ.

The fourth sound is the consequence of the increase in primary eﬀecton
dimensions and the change in their phase velocity as a result of He II interaction
with narrow capillary’s walls and thermal movement immobilization.

The normal component of He II is related to the fraction of He
II atoms not involved in polyeﬀectons formation. This fraction com-
poses individual primary and secondary eﬀectons, maintaining the
In accordance with our
mesoscopic model, these transitions in composition of macroeﬀectons
and macrodeformons are accompanied by the emission and absorption
of heat phonons.

ability for (a ⇔ b) and (cid:0)¯a ⇔ ¯b(cid:1) transitions.

The manifestation of viscous properties in normal liquid and nor-
mal component of He II is related to ﬂuctuations of concentration in
the volume of macrodeformons (V M
D ) - see eqs. 11.48, 11.49 and 11.55
of [1].

On the other hand, macro- and superdeformons are absent in the
superﬂuid component, as far in primary polyeﬀectons at T < Tλ: the
probability of B-state of macroeﬀectons: PB = Pb · ¯Pb → 0; the proba-
bility of A-state of the eﬀectons: PA = Pa · ¯Pa → 1 and, consequently,
the probability of macrodeformons tends to zero: P M
D = PB · PA → 0.
Decreasing the probability of superdeformons P S
D = (P M
D )tr ·(P M
D )lb → 0
means the decreased concentration of cavitational bubbles and vapor

21

pressure.

3. We can explain the decrease in E(k) in Fig. 1 around T = Tλ
by reducing the contributions related to (b) of the primary eﬀectons,
degeneration of secondary eﬀectons due to their Bose-condensation
and concomitant elimination of the contribution of secondary acoustic
deformons (i.e. phonons) to the total energy of liquid 4He.

One can see from eqs. (11.45 - 11.53 of [1] and paper [3]) that under
conditions of superﬂuidity at the absence of secondary eﬀectons, when
the life-time of secondary eﬀectons and cycle-period of macroeﬀectons
(τ M )tr,lb tends to zero, the viscosity also tends to zero: η → 0.

In accordance with the mesoscopic theory of thermal conductivity
(see eqs. 11.35 − 11.37), the elimination of secondary acoustic defor-
mons at T ≤ Tλ must lead also to enhanced thermal conductivity.
This eﬀect was registered experimentally, indeed.

4. The increase in E(k) in Fig. 1 at T < Tλ can be induced by the
enhanced contribution of primary polyeﬀectons to the total energy of
He II and the factor: Utot/Tk = S−1 in the state equation (11.8 of [1])
and eq.(44).

The activity of the normal component of He II as a solvent for
polyeﬀectons reduces and tends to zero at T → 0. Under such condi-
tion (T = 0) superpolymerization and total Bose-condensation occur
in 4He.

The maximum in Fig. 1 at 0 < T < Tλ is the result of competition
of two opposite factors: a rise in the total energy of He II due to
progress of primary eﬀectons polymerization and its reduction due
to the decline in the most probable group velocity (vgr), accompa-
nied by secondary eﬀectons and deformons degeneration (see eq. 46).
The latter process predominates at T → 0. The development of a
polyeﬀectons superﬂuid subsystem is accompanied by a correspond-
ing diminution of the normal component in He II (ρS → 1 and ρ → 0).
The normal component has a bigger internal energy than superﬂuid
one.

The own dimensions of primary translational and librational eﬀec-

tons in composition of polyeﬀectons increases at T → 0.

Veriﬁcation of the inaccessibility of the b-state of primary eﬀectons

at T ≤ Tλ

Let us analyze our formula (2.74 of [1], se also [2]) for the phase velocity of
primary eﬀectons in the (a)-state for the condition T ≤ Tλ, when ﬁlament- like
polyeﬀectons originate:

22

va
ph =

(59)

1 + Pb

res

vS

1−fd

fa

Pa (cid:16) ν b
res(cid:17)

ν b

where: vS is the sound velocity; Pb and Pa are the thermoaccessibility of the (b)
and (a) states of primary eﬀectons; fd and fa are the probabilities of primary
deformons and primary eﬀectons in (a) state excitations (see eq. 2.66 of [1]).

One can see from (59), that if:

Pb → 0, then Pd = Pb · Pa → 0 and fd → 0 at T ≤ Tλ

then phase velocity of the eﬀecton in (a) state tends to sound velocity:

va
ph → vS

(60)

For these λ− point conditions, the total energy of 4He atoms forming poly-
eﬀectons due to Bose-condensation of secondary eﬀectons (see 46) can be pre-
sented as:

Etot ∼ Ea = mvgrva

ph → mvgrvS

(61)

where the empirical sound velocity in He II is vS = 2.4 · 104cm/s .
The kinetic energy of wave B at the same conditions is Tk = mv2

gr/2. Di-

viding Etot by Tk we have, using (47):

and

(63)

m∗ = 0.16m is the semiempirical eﬀective mass at T = Tλ.

The most probable wave B length corresponding to (63) at λ-point:

λ0 = h/mv0

gr = 15.1˚A

(64)

The number of 4He atoms in the volume of the same eﬀecton calculated in
accordance with (54) is equal: q0 = (n0

v)1/3 = 3.8.

This result is even closer to one predicted by the mesoscopic model (see 55)
than (53). It conﬁrms that at T ≤ Tλ the probability of b-state Pb → 0 and
conditions (60) and (61) take place indeed.

In such a way our mesoscopic model of superﬂuidity explains the available
experimental data on liquid 4He in a noncontradiction manner as a limit case
of our mesoscopic viscosity theory for normal liquids.

23

6. Superﬂuidity in 3He

The scenario of superﬂuity, described above for Bose-liquid of 4He (S = 0)
in principle is valid for Fermi-liquid of 3He (S = ±1/2) as well. A basic diﬀer-
ence is determined by an additional preliminary stage related to the formation
of Cooper pairs of 3He atoms with total spins, equal to 1, i.e. with boson’s
properties. The bosons only can form eﬀectons as coherent clusters containing
particles with equal energies.

We assume in our model that Cooper’s pairs can be formed be-
tween neighboring 3He atoms. It means that the minimum number
of 3He atoms forming part of the primary eﬀecton’s edge at λ-point
must be 8, i.e. two times more than that in 4He (condition 55). Cor-
respondingly, the number of 3He atoms in the volume of an eﬀecton
V )3He = 83 = 312. These conditions explains the fact that super-
is (n0
ﬂuidityin 3He arises at temperature T = 2.6 · 10−3K, i.e.
lower than
that in 4He. The formation of ﬂexible ﬁlament-like polyeﬀectons, rep-
resenting macroscopic Bose-condensate in liquid 3He responsible for
superﬂuidity, is a process, similar to that in 4He described above.

7. Superconductivity

General properties of metals and semiconductors

The dynamics of conductance electrons in metals and semiconduc-
tors is determined by three main factors (Kittel, 1978, Ashkroft and
Mermin, 1976, Blakemore, 1985):

1. The electric ﬁeld inﬂuencing the energy of electrons.
2. The magnetic ﬁelds changing the direction of electrons motions.
3. Scattering on the other electrons, ions, phonons, defects.
The latter factor determines the values of the electron conductance and

resistance.

In spite of the small mean distances between electrons in metals (2-3)˚A
their mean free run length at room temperatures exceeds 104˚A and grows by
several orders at T → 0. It is related to the fact that only electrons having
energy higher than Fermi energy (ǫF ) may be involved in collisions.
The fraction of these electrons in the total number of electrons is very small and
decreases on lowering the temperature as (kT /ǫF )2. At room temperatures the
scattering of electrons in metals occurs mainly on phonons.

The mean free run length of electrons in indium at 2K is about 30 cm.
The analysis of electric and magnetic ﬁelds inﬂuence on an electron needs the
notion of its eﬀective mass (m∗). It is introduced as a proportionality coeﬃcient
between the force acting on the electron and the acceleration (a) in the electric
ﬁeld (E):

24

F = −eE = m∗a;

a = dvgr/dt

(65)

In a simple case of an isotropic solid body the eﬀective mass of an electron is a
scalar (Kittel, 1978):

m∗ =

h2

d2ǫ/dk2

(66)

where ǫ is the kinetic energy of an electron, having a quadratic dependence on
the wave number (k = 1/LB):

ǫ =

2k2
m∗ =

2

2mL2

(67)

In a general case, for electrons in solid bodies with a complex periodic structure,
the eﬀective mass is a tensor:

[m∗

ij ] = 2/[∂2ǫ/∂ki∂kj]

(68)

The eﬀective mass tensor can have positive components for some
directions and negative for others.

Plasma oscillations

At every displacement of the electron gas relative to the subsystem of ions
in a solid body, a returning electric ﬁeld appears. As a consequence of that, the
subsystem of electrons will oscillate relative to the subsystem of ions with the
characteristic plasma frequency (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1976):

ωpl = 2πνpl =(cid:18) 4πne2

m∗ (cid:19)1/2

(69)

where: (n) is the number of electrons in 1cm3, (e) is the charge and (m∗) is the
eﬀective mass of an electron.

The quantiﬁed collective oscillations of electron plasma are termed plasmons.
With decreasing (n) from 1022 to 1010cm−3 the frequencies ωpl decrease from
6 · 1015s−1 to 6 · 103s−1. For metals ωpl corresponds to an ultraviolet frequency
range, and for semiconductors - to an IR frequency range.

For longitudinal plasma oscillations at small wave vectors the dependence
of frequency on the wave number (k = 1/L = 2π/λ) can be approximately
represented as (Kittel, 1978):

25

ω ≈ ωpl · 1 +

3k2v2
F
10ω2
pl

+ . . .!

(70)

where: vF is the Fermi velocity of an electron (see eq.77).

The screening length (l), characterizing the electron-electron interaction in

plasmon when Fermi-gas is degenerated is equal to:

l = vF /νp ∼ 1˚A in metals

(71)

For the cases of non-degenerated Fermi-gas, when the concentrations of free
electrons are suﬃciently low (in semiconductors) or at high temperatures T ∼
104K, the screening length (ld) is dependent on thermal electron velocity:

and

vth =(cid:0) 3kBT /m∗ (cid:1)1/2

lD = vth/νp

∼=(cid:18) ǫkbT

4πne2(cid:19)1/2

(72)

(73)

where: νpl corresponds to (69), ǫ is the dielectric constant.
For example, if in a semiconductor n = 5 · 1017cm−3 and ǫ = 12,then lD =

60˚A (March, Parrinello, 1982).

Fermi energy

The notion of Fermi energy (ǫF ) can be derived from the Pauli
principle forbidding the fermions to be in the same energetic states.
The formula for Fermi energy for the case of ideal electron gas
includes the electron mass (m), the Plank constant (h = 2π) and the
concentration of free electrons (ne = Ne/V ):

ǫF =

h2

2m(cid:18) 3

πme(cid:19)3/2

=

2π22

m (cid:18) 3

8

πme(cid:19)3/2

(73a)

where Ne is the number of free electrons in selected volume (V ).
For a real electron gas, m must be substituted by its eﬀective mass:
m → m∗.

The formula (73a) can also be derived using the idea of standing
waves B of the unbind electrons of matter. The condition under which

26

the concentration of twice polarized standing waves B of electrons is
equal to the concentration of electrons themselves:

The wave B length of an electron corresponding to this condition is:

The kinetic energy of the unbind electrons waves B (Tk) could be expressed
through their length and mass. It appears that the kinetic energy of the electrons
standing waves B, limited by their concentration is equal to Fermi energy:

(77)

The Fermi energy corresponds to Fermi temperature (TF ):

ǫF = kTF = hνF

(78)

At T < TF electron gas is in a strongly ”compressed” state. The
more the relation (T /TF ) = kT /ǫF , the more the probability of the
appearance of ”free volume” in a dense electron gas. On lowering the
temperature, when the impulse of electrons decreases and the heat
wave B length increases, the ”eﬀective pressure” of the electron gas
grows, leading to its Bose-condensation.

Cyclotronic resonance

The magnetic ﬁeld Bz in the direction (z) inﬂuencing the electron
by the Lorentz force, changes the direction of its motion without
changing the energy. If an electron’s energy does not dissipate, then
the electrons rotate in the plane xy, around z-axis. Such an electron
with the eﬀective mass m∗ has a circulation orbit of the radius r, with
rotation frequency ωc. From the condition of equality between the

27

Lorentz force (rωceBz) and the centrifugal force (m∗ω2
is derived for angular cyclotron frequency (Kittel, 1978):

c r) the formula

The kinetic energy, corresponding to the rotation is equal to:

ωc = eBz/m∗

Tk =

m∗(ωc)2r2

(79)

(80)

In the range of radio-frequencies (ω) such a value of the magnetic induction Bz
can be selected that at this value the resonance energy absorption occurs, when
ω = ωc.

Such experiments on the cyclotron resonance can be done to determine m∗

in selected directions.

In a simple case, an electron revolves around the Fermi sphere with the zero

impulse component in z-direction.

The radius of this sphere is determined by the Fermi impulse PF

(see eq. 77). In the real space:

The energy of free particles near the Fermi surface:

rF ∼ /PF

ǫ(PF ) = vF (P − PF )

(81)

(82)

where: vF and PF = m∗vF are the Fermi velocity and impulse: P > PF is
the impulse of thermal electron at T > 0 near the Fermi surface.

The solution of the Schr¨odinger equation, modiﬁed by Landau for electrons
in a magnetic ﬁeld in real space leads to the following total energy eigenvalues
(Blakemore, 1985):

ǫ =

where the ﬁrst term of the right part represent the energy of translational motion
of electrons, which does not depend on magnetic ﬁeld magnitude; kz = 1/Lz
is the wave number of this motion; the second term is responsible for rotational
energy,
l = 0, 1, 2 . . . is the integer quantum number for rotational motion in
magnetic ﬁeld Bz. Every value of l means a corresponding Landau level.

Thus, free electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld move along the helical trajectory of

the radius:

rl = [(2l + 1)/m∗ωc]1/2

(84)

At the transition from real space to the wave number space, the radius

In a strong magnetic ﬁeld the quantization of electrons energy
leads to the periodic dependence of the metal magnetic moment on
the magnetic ﬁeld (B): the de Haaz - van Alfen eﬀect (Kittel, 1978,
Ashkroft and Mermin, 1976).

Electroconductivity

According to the Sommerfeld theory (Blakemore, 1985), electroconductivity

(σ) depends on the free run time of an electron (τ ) between collisions:

σ = ne2τ /m,

(86)

where:n is the concentration of electrons, (e) and (m) are electron charge and
mass.

The free run time is equal to the ratio of the average free run distance (λ)

of electrons to the Fermi speed (vF ):

τ = λ/vF

(87)

The free run distance is determined by scattering at defects (λD) and scattering
at phonons (λph):

The resistance (R = 1/σ) could be expressed as:

1/λ = 1/λD + 1/λph

R = 1/σD + 1/σph = RD + Rph

(88)

(89)

the contribution RD depends mainly on the concentration of the conductors
defects, and the phonon contribution Rph depends on temperature.

Formula (89) expresses the Mattisen rule.
A transition to a superconducting state means that the free run time and
distance tend to inﬁnity: τ → ∞; λ ≃ λef = h/Pef → ∞, while the resulting
group velocity of the electrons (vres

gr ) and impulses tends to zero:

29

Pef = m · vres

gr → 0

The emergency of macroscopic Bose-condensation of secondary ionic eﬀectons
and Cooper pairs corresponds to this condition.

We assume in our hierarchic model, that the absence of the non-
elastic scattering and dissipation of electrons energy is observed as
superconductivity, when the probability of secondary ionic eﬀectons
and deformons tends to zero, leading to emergency of primary elec-
tronic polyeﬀectons.

Let us consider ﬁrst a conventional microscopic approach to the

problem of superconductivity.

8. Microscopic theory of superconductivity (BCS)

This theory (BCS) was created by Bardin, Cooper and Schriﬀer
in 1957. The basic, experimentally proven assumption of this theory,
is that electrons at suﬃciently low temperatures are grouped into
Cooper pairs with oppositely directed spins - Bose-particles with a
zero spin. The charge of the pair is equal to e∗ = 2e and mass m∗ = 2me.
Such electron pairs obey the Bose-Einstein statistic. The Bose-
condensation of this system at the temperature below the Bose-gas
condensation temperature (T < Tk) leads to the superﬂuidityof the
electron liquid. This superﬂuidity(analogous to the superﬂuidityof
liquid helium) is manifested as superconductivity.

According to BCS’s theory, the Cooper electron pair formation
mechanism is the consequence of virtual phonon exchange through
the lattice.

The energy of binding between the electrons in a pair is very low:
2∆ ∼ 3kTc. It determines a minimum energetic gap (∆) separating a
state of superconductivity from a state of usual conductivity.

Notwithstanding that the kinetic energy of electrons in a super-
conducting state is greater than ǫF ,, the contribution of the potential
energy of attraction between electron pairs is such that the total en-
ergy of the superconducting state (Ee
a) is smaller than the Fermi en-
ergy (ǫF ) (Kittel, 1978). The presence of the energetic gap ∆ makes
a superconducting state stable after switching-oﬀ external voltage.
The middle of the gap coincides with the Fermi level.

The rupture of a pair can happen due to photon absorption by
superconductor with the energy: ∆ = hνp ≈ 3kTc. Superconductivity
usually disappears in the frequency range 109 < νp < 1014s−1.

In the BCS theory, the magnitude ∆ is proportional to the number

of Cooper pairs and grows on lowering the temperature.

The excitation energy of quasiparticles in a superconducting state,

which is characterized by the wave number (k), is:

30

Ek = (ǫ2

k + ∆2)1/2,

ǫk =

2

m

(k2 − k2

F ) ≈

2

m

kF (k − kF )

(90)

(91)

where

and

δkF = (k − kF ) ≪ kF = 1/LF

The critical speed of the electron gas (vc), for exciting a transition from a
superconducting state to a normal one is determined from the condition:

Ek = kvc and vc =

Ek
k

(92)

The wave function Φ(r), which describes the properties of electron pairs in the
BCS theory, is the superposition of one-electron functions with energies in a
range of about 2∆ near ǫF . Therefore, the dispersion of impulses for one-
electron levels involved in the formation of pairs is expressed as:

∆ = δǫF = δ(cid:18) P 2

2m(cid:19) =(cid:18) PF

F

m (cid:19) δPF ≈ vF δPF

(93)

The characteristic coherence length (ξc) of the pair function Φ(r) has the value
(Ashkroft and Mermin, 1976, Lifshits and Pitaevsky, 1978):

ξc ∼ /δPF ≃

vF
∆

≃

1
kF

ǫF
∆

(94)

The magnitude (ǫF /∆) is usually 103 − 104, and kF = 1/LF ∼ 108cm−1. Thus,
from (94):

ξc ∼ (103 − 104) ˚A

(95)

Inside the region of coherence length (ξc) there are millions of pairs. The im-
pulses of pairs in such regions are correlated in such a way that their resulting
impulse is equal to zero.

At T > 0 some of the pairs turn to a dissociated state and the concentration
of superconducting electrons (ns) decreases. The coherence length (ξc) also
tends to zero with increase in temperature.

31

The important parameter, characterizing the properties of a superconductor
is the value of the critical magnetic ﬁeld (Hc), above which the superconductor
switches to a normal state.

With a rise in the temperature of the superconductor when T → Tc, the
critical ﬁeld tends at zero: Hc → 0. And vice versa, at lowering of temperature,
when

the Hc grows up as:

T < Tc,
Hc = H0[1 − (T /Tc)2]

where H0 corresponds to T = 0.

The Meisner eﬀect - the ”forcing” of the outer magnetic ﬁeld out of
the superconductor is also an important feature of superconductivity.
The depth of magnetic ﬁeld penetration into the superconductor

(λ) (Kittel, 1978, Ashkroft and Mermin, 1976) is:

λ = (mǫ0c2/e2ns)1/2 ≃ (10−6 − 10−5)cm,

where ns the density of electrons in a superﬂuid state; ǫ0 - dielectric
constant.

On temperature raising from 0 K to Tc, the λ grows as:

λ =

λ0

(cid:20)1 −(cid:16) T

Tc(cid:17)4(cid:21)1/2 ,

(96)

where: λ0 corresponds to λ at T = 0.

The superconductors with magnetic ﬁeld penetration depth (λ)

less than coherence length ξ ::

are termed ﬁrst order superconductors and those with

λ ≪ ξ

λ ≫ ξ

(97)

(98)

are second order ones.

Nowadays, in connection with the discovery of high temperature
superconductivity (Bednorz, Muller, 1986, Nelson, 1987) the mecha-
nism of stabilizing electron pairs by means of virtual phonons in the
BCS theory evokes doubts.

32

9. Mesoscopic scenario of superconductivity

We propose a new mechanism of electron pair formation and their
subsequent Bose-condensation, without virtual phonons as mediators.
Such a process is analogous to the formation of primary polyeﬀectons
in liquid helium related to superﬂuidityphenomena (see Section 5).

Two basic questions must be answered in relation to the emergence

of superconductivity:

I. Why does energy dissipation in the system [conductivity elec-

trons + lattice] disappear at T ≤ Tc ?

II. How does the coherence in this system, related to electron pair

formation, originate ?

It will be shown below how these problems can be solved in the

framework of our Hierarchic (mesoscopic) theory.

The following factors can aﬀect electron’s dynamics and scattering

near Fermi energy:

1. Interaction of electrons with primary and secondary ionic ef-
fectons in acoustic (a) and (¯a) states, stimulating Cooper pairs for-
mation;

2. Interaction with primary and secondary eﬀectons of lattice in
acoustic (b) and (¯b) states, leading to origination of polarons and
Cooper pairs dissociation;

3. Interaction with transitons in the course of (a ⇔ b) and
(¯a ⇔ ¯b) transitions of primary and secondary eﬀectons;
4.

Interaction with [tr/lb] convertons (interconversions between

primary translational and librational eﬀectons;

5. Interaction with primary electromagnetic deformons;
6. Interaction with secondary acoustic deformons (possibility of

polaron formation);

7. Interaction with macroeﬀectons in A- and B-states;
8. Interaction with macro- and superdeformons (possible emer-

gence of defectons).

It follows from our model that the oscillations of all types of quasiparticles in
conductors and semiconductors are accompanied not only by electron-phonon
scattering, but also by electromagnetic interaction of primary deformons with
unbind electrons.

At T > Tc the ﬂuctuations of unbind electrons with energy higher than
Fermi one under the inﬂuence of factors (1 - 8) are random (noise-like) and no
selected order of ﬂuctuations in normal conductors exists. It means that ideal
Fermi-gas approximation for such electrons is suﬃciently good. In this case, the
eﬀective electron mass can be close to that of a free electron (m∗ ≃ m).

33

Electric current in normal conductors at external voltage should
dissipate due to ﬂuctuations and energy exchange of the electrons
with lattice determined by factors (1 - 8).

Coherent in-phase acoustic oscillation of the ionic primary eﬀec-
tons in (a)-state is the ”ordering factor” simulating electron gas co-
herence due to electromagnetic interactions. But its contribution in
normal conductors at T > Tc is very small. For an ideal electron gas,
the total energy (Etot) of each electron as wave B is equal to its kinetic
energy (Tk), as far potential energy (V = 0):

where:

and

Etot = ω =

2mL2

Tk =

2mL2

L =



(99)

(100)

(101)

One can see from (100) that for an ideal gas, when m = m∗, the most
probable amplitude (A) and wave B length (L) are equal:

A = L,

if Etot = Tk and V = 0

(102)

Like in case of liquid helium at conditions of superﬂuity, Bose- con-
densation in metals and semiconductors is related to an increase in
the concentration of the (a)-state of primary eﬀectons with the low-
est energy and a corresponding decrease in the concentrations of all
other excitations. The Bose-condensation and degeneration of sec-
ondary ionic eﬀectons and deformons, followed by formation of elec-
tronic polyeﬀectons from Cooper pairs is responsible for second order
phase transition like superconductivity.

The cooperative character of 2nd order phase transition [conductor → super-
conductor] is determined by a feedback reaction between the lattice and electron
subsystems. It means that the collective Bose-condensation in both subsystems
is starting at the same temperature: T = Tc.

Under such conditions the probabilities of the (a)-states of ionic (P i

electronic (P e

a ) eﬀectons tend to 1 at T ≤ Tc:

a) and

P i
a → 1; P e
P i
b → 0; P e

a → 1

b → 0 (cid:27)

34

(103)

The equilibrium parameter for both subsystems:

κi,e =(cid:18) Pa − Pb

Pa + Pb(cid:19)i,e

→ 1

and the order parameter :

ηi,e = (1 − κi,e) → 0

(104)

(105)

like in a 2nd order phase transition for liquid helium (see eq. 58).

In our model the coherent Cooper pairs are formed as Bose parti-
cles with resulting spin equal to 0 and 1 from neighboring electrons,
in contrast to the BCS theory, which assumes phonons - mediated
interaction between distant electrons.

Such pairs can compose primary electron’s eﬀectons (e-eﬀectons) as a co-
herent cluster with a resulting impulse equal to zero. Formation of secondary
e-eﬀectons with nonzero resulting impulse is possible also. Just the interaction
of this secondary e-eﬀectons with lattice is responsible for electric resistance in
normal conductors. Degeneration of such type of excitations in the process of
their Bose-condensation and their conversion to primary e-eﬀectons means the
emergency of superconductivity.

The in-phase coherent oscillations of the integer number of elec-
tron pairs forming primary e-eﬀectons correspond to its acoustic (a)-
state, and the counterphase oscillations to its optic (b) state, like in
ionic or molecular eﬀectons.

We assume that superconductivity can originate only when the
fraction of unbind coherent electrons forming primary e-eﬀectons
in certain regions of conductor strongly prevails over the fraction of
noncoherent secondary e-eﬀectons. Due to feedback reaction between
subsystems of lattice and electrons this fraction should be equal to
ratio of wave length of primary and secondary ionic eﬀectons. This
condition can be introduced as:

(II) :(cid:18) λe

where: λe

a is the ratio of wave lengths of primary and sec-
ondary e- eﬀectons, equal to that of primary and secondary eﬀectons
of lattice; sound velocity is equal to lattice primary eﬀectons phase
velocity in (a) state: vs ≃ va

are the periods of electron’s oscillations modulated by the oscilla-
tions of primary and secondary ionic eﬀecton’s in the acoustic states.
As far the oscillations of e-pairs in the Bose-condensate (a-state of
e- eﬀectons) are modulated by the electromagnetic ﬁeld, radiated by
oscillating ions in the (a)-state of primary ionic eﬀectons they must
have the same frequency.

Condition (106) means that the number of electrons in the volume
(Ve ∼ λ3) of primary e-eﬀectons is about 103 times more than that in
secondary e-eﬀectons. The lattice and electronic eﬀectons subsystems
are spatially compatible.

As far the eﬀective mass (m∗) of the electrons in the coherent
macroscopic Bose-condensate organized by e-polyeﬀectons at condi-
tions of superconductivity tends to inﬁnity:

T < Tc
m∗ 7−→ ∞
T → 0

(108)

the plasma frequency (eq. 69) tends to zero:

2πνpl = ωpl

T < Tc
7−→ 0
at T → 0

and, consequently, the screening length (eq.71) tends to inﬁnity: l →
∞. This condition also corresponds to that of macroscopic Bose-
condensation emergency

Under these conditions an impulse (see eq.93) originates in addi-

tion to Fermi’s one:

δPF = δkF > 0

(109)

but a decrease in the potential energy of both electron’s and ion’s
subsystems due to leftward (a ⇔ b) equilibrium shift leads to the
emergence of the gap near the Fermi surface (2∆) depending on the
diﬀerence of energy between (a) and (b) states of primary eﬀectons.
The linear dimension of coherent primary electronic eﬀectons (e-
eﬀectons), which is equal to coherence length in the BCS theory (see
eq. 94) is determined by additional impulse δPF :

ξ = λe

a =

vs
νa

= h/∆pF = h/me∆vF

(110)

In turn, the primary e-eﬀecton in (a)-state can form e- polyeﬀec-
tons as a result of their polymerization. The starting point of this

36

collective process represents macroscopic Bose - condensation and
second order phase transition in accordance with our model.

The energy gap between normal and superconductive states can be
calculated directly from our mesoscopic theory, as the diﬀerence be-

tween the total energy of matter before (cid:2) U T >Tc

the second order phase transition:

tot

(cid:3) and after (cid:2) U T <Tc

tot

(cid:3)

2∆ = U T >Tc − U T <Tc

(111)

However, such experimental parameters as sound velocity, density
and the positions of bands in a far IR region must be available around
transition temperature (Tc) for calculation of (111).

This gap must be close to the energy of (a → b)i transitions of ionic
primary eﬀectons, related to the energy of (a → b)e transitions of the
electronic e-eﬀectons (see 103 - 105).

This statement of our superconductivity model coincides well with

the experimental destruction of superconductivity state by IR-radiation
with minimum frequency (νg), corresponding to the energy gap (2∆)
at given temperature:

hνg = 2∆ ∼ (Eb − Ea)

(112)

Another general feature of superconductivity for low- and high-

temperature superconductors is the almost constant ratio:

2∆0
kBTc

≃ 3.5

(113)

where the gap: ∆ = ∆0 at T = Tc and ∆ = 0 at T > Tc.

It will be shown below that the experimental result (113) is related
to condition (106) of our mesoscopic model of superconductivity.

Considering (112), (113) and (2.27), the frequency of a primary

ionic eﬀectons in a-state near transition temperature is:

νi
a =

g

exp(cid:16) 2∆

(115)

The frequency of secondary lattice eﬀectons in (a)−state in accor-

dance with (2.54) is:

a

νa ≃ kTc/h,

(117)

Now, using (17), (116) and (113) we conﬁrm the correctness of

condition (106):

λe
a/λe

a = (¯νa/νa)i =(cid:20)exp(cid:18) hνi

(118)

where:

λe
a = h/2me(va

gr)e = (vs/νa)i

(119)

is the most probable wave B length of coherent electron pairs compos-
ing a primary e-eﬀecton; (va
gr)e is a group velocity of electron pairs in
a-state of primary e-eﬀectons, stimulated by ionic lattice oscillations:

λe
a = h/2m∗va

gr = (vs/νa)i

(120)

is the mean wave B length of electron pair forming the eﬀective sec-
ondary e-eﬀecton.

Our theory predicts also the another condition of coherency be-
tween ionic and electronic subsystems, leading to superconductivity,
when the linear dimension of primary translational ionic eﬀectons
grows up to the value of coherence length (see eq.94):

(λi

In simple metals a relation between sound (vs) and Fermi velocities
(vF ) is determined by the electron to ion mass ratio (me/M )1/2(March
and Parinello, 1982):

where: z is the valence of ions in a metal.

vs =(cid:16) zme

(122)

Putting (νi

a)tr from eq.(115) and eq.(122) in condition (121), and
introducing instead electron mass its eﬀective mass (m∗) in composi-
tion of e-eﬀecton , we obtain at T = Tc:

m∗ Tc

≃ 2 · 10−4 ·

M
z

(123)

As far we assume here that at transition temperature (Tc) the
volumes of primary lattice (ionic) eﬀectons and primary e-eﬀectons
coincide, then the number of electrons in the volume of primary ef-
fectons is:

Ne = ne · V i

ef = ne ·

(124)

where: ne is a concentration of the electrons; V i

ef = V e

ef is the

volume of primary translational ionic eﬀectons.

Using the relation between primary and secondary ionic waves B
(106) at Tc as λa = 10λa, taking into account (117) and (121) we got:

(126)

If for the diﬀerent isotopes the energetic gap is constant (2∆ ≃
const), then the left part of (126) is constant also. Such an important
correlation between transition temperature (Tc) and isotope mass (M)
is experimentally conﬁrmed for many metals:

Tc ≃(cid:18) h

(127)

This result as well as (117) can be considered as evidence in proof

for our model of superconductivity.

39

It leads from (127) that the more rigid is lattice and the bigger is
sound velocity (vs), the higher is transition temperature. Anisotropy
of vs means the anisotropy of superconductor properties and can be
aﬀected by external factors such as pressure.

It was shown in this article, that all most important phenom-
ena, related to turbulence, superﬂuidityand superconductivity can
be explained in the framework of our Hierarchic theory.

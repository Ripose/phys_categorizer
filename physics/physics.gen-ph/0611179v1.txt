Quantum Geometry of the Dynamical Space-time

Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel

P. Leifer1

Abstract

Quantum theory of ﬁeld (extended) objects without a priori space-time
geometry has been represented. Intrinsic coordinates in the tangent ﬁbre
bundle over complex projective Hilbert state space CP (N − 1) are used
instead of space-time coordinates. The fate of quantum system modeled
by the generalized coherent states is rooted in this manifold. Dynami-
cal (state-dependent) space-time arises only at the stage of the quantum
“yes/no” measurement. The quantum measurement of the gauge “ﬁeld
shell” of the generalized coherent state is described in terms of the aﬃne
parallel transport of the local dynamical variables in CP (N − 1).

1 Introduction

Strings, membranes are most popular now models of extended quantum objects.
They were evoked mostly in order to avoid divergences in quantum ﬁeld theory.
These speculative models give rise for interesting cosmological constructions
that are very far from the mature paradigm of our Universe. But I have a doubt
that we have now reliable tools for the discussions of global space-time structure
(quantum cosmology) since behind achievements in quantum physics we have
fundamental unsolved problems in the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM),
quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT), etc.

I would like to show in this work that there are diﬀerent kind of extended
quantum objects which I called “ﬁeld shell” of generalized coherent states
(GCS’s) and that in the framework of this model, the local structure of the
quantum (or dynamical) space-time has a natural Minkowskian 4D form.

Fast progress achieved in QFT due to eﬀorts of Dirac, Fermi, Jordan, Wigner
and other physicists/mathematecans led to jump over gap between one-body
problem, which mostly is the academic one, to many-body problem, which is,
of course, more practical. However the practical success of the QM and QFT
cannot hide the principle diﬃculties in the one-body quantum problem. I will

recall shortly these diﬃculties: the deep disagreement between both special and
general relativity and quantum theory [1], in particular: delocalization of the
relativistic wave-function [2]; divergences problem in QFT; the problem of the
mass spectrum, etc. The necessity of the quantum geometry as an universal
tool evoked to remove diﬃculties in foundations of quantum theory has been
already discussed [3]. One of the main obstacle on this way is just the problem
of quantum interactions and their applications to QM measurement problem as
the one of the most important in the modern physics [1].

Macroscopic objects are typically well individualizable because of weak inter-
action and this is the base for our abstraction to material points and further to
mathematical points which mutually diﬀer only by space-time coordinates. In
quantum area we generally loss this possibility. But of course the conservation
of some fundamental dynamical variables does exist. This conservation is re-
lated to some internal symmetry of a quantum system and it gives a mechanism
of identiﬁcation of some quantum particle in the framework of one-body prob-
lem. One-body measurement (besides bubble chamber measurements) is rarely
achievable. The most close to one-body quantum measurement is measurement
I would like to show in present work that the polariza-

tion measurements of coherent photons described from the point of view of the
breakdown of U (2) symmetry [4], may be generalized to the measurement of
arbitrary Hermitian dynamical variable of a “N-level” system as a breakdown
of the G = SU (N ) symmetry.

2 The Action Quantization

Schr¨odinger sharply denied the existence of so-called “quantum jumps” during
the process of emission/absorption of the quants of energy (particles) [5, 6].
Leaving the question about the nature of quantum particles outside of consider-
ation, he thought about these processes as a resonance of the de Broglie waves
that phenomenologically may look like “jumps” between two “energy levels”.
The second quantization method formally avoids these questions but there are
at least two reasons for its modiﬁcation:

First. In the second quantization method one has formally given particles
whose properties are deﬁned by some commutation relations between creation-
annihilation operators. Note, that the commutation relations are only the sim-
plest consequence of the curvature of the dynamical group manifold in the vicin-
ity of the group’s unit (in algebra). Dynamical processes require, however, ﬁnite
group transformations and, hence, the global group structure. The main my
technical idea is to use vector ﬁelds over a group manifold instead of Dirac’s
abstract q-numbers. This scheme therefore seeks the dynamical nature of the
creation and annihilation processes of quantum particles.

Second. The quantum particles (energy bundles) should gravitate. Hence,
strictly speaking, their behavior cannot be described as a linear superposition.
Therefore the ordinary second quantization method (creation-annihilation of
free particles) is merely a good approximate scheme due to the weakness of

2

gravity. Thereby the creation and annihilation of particles are time consuming
dynamical non-linear processes. So, linear operators of creation and annihilation
(in Dirac sense) do exist as approximate quantities.

I discuss here a modiﬁcation of the “second quantization” procedure. One

vacuum of some problem is not necessarily the state with minimal energy, it is
a state with an extremal of some action functional.

i.e. not only for the description of processes of photon reﬂection on a mirror,
refraction in a glass, etc., [7], but to quantum particles, leads to conclusion
that quantum particles arose as some dynamical processes. In other words the
Schr¨odinger’s idea of shaping stable wave packet (as the model of material point
of the classical oscillator) [8] from oscillators wave functions will applied now
to the shaping of the action amplitudes of an arbitrary quantum system. Their
evolution is deﬁned pure geometrically by some internal unitary gauge “ﬁeld
shell” of the quantum particle. It is close to the old idea of the “ﬁeld of unitary
spin” splitting the hadrons super-multiplete. The stationary processes are rep-
resented by stable particles and quasi-stationary processes are represented by
unstable resonances.

3 Non-linear treatment of the eigen-problem

H

In the famous ﬁrst report, Schr¨odinger formulated a conditional variation prob-
lem for a “wave function” corresponding to an electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld.
This is the eigen-problem for self-adjoint Hamiltonian in separable Hilbert space
[9]. Starting from the internal symmetry given by SU (N ) group we will discuss
= CN . In
variation problem formulated on ﬁnite dimension Hilbert space
this case the eigen-values of some self-adjoint linear operator ˆD are minimal
(stationary) values of the quadratic form < F
1) [10] achiev-
able at corresponding eigen-vectors of rays. For us will be important the explicit
parametrization of these rays by local coordinates in CP (N

F > on CP (N
|

ˆD
|

Let me start from the eigen-problem for linear operator ˆD acting in CN . This
is the typically linear problem in the framework of the theory of linear operators.
Furthermore, physicists have essential simpliﬁcation of the problem dealing with
hermitian or unitary operators. The invariant sub-spaces of these operators are
one-dimensional even for degenerated eigen-values, the Jordan cells are one-
dimension, and, therefore, these operators are diagonalizable. If so, there is a
reasonable question: why one should deep into the non-linear formulation, if the
linear one seems to be good enough? It is really so if one deals with the eigen
problem for a single matrix of operator. But I seek for the dynamical description
of the creation-annihilation processes of particles. This dynamical picture gives
a parameterized family of operators; hence arise the instability problem of the

1) .

spectrum structure close to the degeneracy and the Berry’s anholonomy too [11].
Therefore the non-linear approach is in fact inevitable since the realistic theory
in any case requires the dynamical re-deﬁnitions of the creation-annihilation
operators (the most clear this is realized by the Yni, Zni coeﬃcients of Dirac
[12]).

The quantum mechanics assumes the priority of the Hamiltonian given by
some classical model which henceforth should be “quantized”.
It is known
that this procedure is ambiquous. In order to avoid the ambiguity, I intend to
use a quantum state itself and the invariant conditions of its conservation and
perturbation. These invariant conditions are rooted into the global geometry
of the dynamical group manifold. Namely, the geometry of G = SU (N ), the
1) of the pure quantum state, and the coset
isotropy group H = U (1)
1) geometry, play an essential role in the quantum
G/H = SU (N )/U (1)
state evolution (the super-relativity principle [13]). The stationary states (some
eigen-states of action operator, i.e. the states of motion with the least action)
may be treated as initial conditions for GCS evolution. Particulary they may
represent a local minimum of energy (vacuum).

It is easy to see that these solutions being substituted into the ﬁrst omitted
equation give us simply re-formulated initial characteristic equation of the eigen-
problem. Therefore one has the single value nonlinear solution of the eigen-
problem instead of the linear one with additional freedom of a complex scale
multiplication.

This approach does not give essential advantage for a single operator and it
only shows that the formulation in local coordinates is quite natural. But if one
tries to understand how the multi-dimensional variation of the hermitian oper-
ator included in a parameterized family, the local formulation is in inevitable.
First of all it is interesting to know the invariants of such variations. In partic-
ular the quantum measurement of dynamical variable represented by hermitian
N matrix should be described in the spirit of typical polarization measure-
N
ment of the coherent photons [4]. I will put below the sketch that depicts the
operational “travel” of polarization state on the Poincar´e sphere.

×

The initial state

x > is modulated passing through an optically active
|
medium (say using the Faraday eﬀect in YIG ﬁlm magnetized along the main
axes in the z-direction by a harmonic magnetic ﬁeld with frequency Ω and the
angle amplitude β). Formally this process may be described by the action of
the unitary matrix ˆhos3 belonging to the isotropy group of
R > [13]. Then the
|
coherence vector will oscillate along the equator of the Poincar´e sphere. The
x′(t) >= ˆhos3 |
x > with fre-
next step is the dragging of the oscillating state
|
quency ω up to the “north pole” corresponding to the state
R >. In fact this
|
is the motion of the coherence vector. This may be achieved by the variation of
2 = π
4 up to θ
the azimuth of the linear polarized state from θ
4 with help of
the dense ﬂint of appropriate length embedded into the sweeping magnetic ﬁeld.
Further this beam should pass the λ/4 plate. This process of variation of the
ellipticity of the polarization ellipse may be described by the unitary matrix ˆbos′
belonging to the coset homogeneous sub-manifold U (2)/U (1)
U (1) = CP (1)
of the dynamical group U (2) [13]. This dragging without modulation leads to
the evolution of the initial state along the geodesic of CP (1) and the trace of
the coherent vector is the meridian of the Poincar´e sphere between the equa-
tor and one of the poles. The modulation deforms both the geodesic and the

2 =

corresponding trace of the coherence vector on the Poincar´e sphere during such
unitary evolution.

The action of the λ/4 plate depends upon the state of the incoming beam
(the relative orientation of the fast axes of the plate and the polarization of
the beam). Furthermore, only relative phases and amplitudes of photons in the
beam have a physical meaning for the λ/4 plate. Neither the absolute amplitude
(intensity of the beam), nor the general phase aﬀect the polarization character
of the outgoing state. It means that the device action depends only upon the
local coordinates π1 = Ψ1
CP (1). Small relative re-orientation of the λ/4
plate and the incoming beam leads to a small variation of the outgoing state.
This means that the λ/4 plate re-orientation generates the tangent vector to
CP (1). It is natural to discuss the two components of such a vector: velocities
of the variations of the ellipticity and of the azimuth (inclination) angle of
the polarization ellipse. They are examples of LDV. The comparison of such
dynamical variables for diﬀerent coherent states requires that aﬃne parallel
transport agrees with the Fubini-Study metric.

Generally, in the dynamical situation this “stationary” global procedure is
not applicable and one should go to the local analog of ˆλ-matrices, i.e. SU (N )
generators and related dynamical variables should be parameterized by the local
quantum states coordinates (π1, ..., πN −1).

4 Local dynamical variables

H

The state space
with ﬁnite action quanta is a stationary construction. We
introduce dynamics by the velocities of the GCS variation representing some
“elementary excitations” (quantum particles). Their dynamics is speciﬁed by
the Hamiltonian, giving time variation velocities of the action quantum numbers
in diﬀerent directions of the tangent Hilbert space T(π1,...,πN −1)CP (N
1) which
takes the place of the ordinary linear quantum state space as will be explained
below. The rate of the action variation gives the energy of the “particles” whose
expression should be established by some wave equations.

The local dynamical variables correspond to the internal SU (N ) group of
the GCS and their breakdown should be expressed now in terms of the local
coordinates πk. The Fubini-Study metric

At ﬁrst sight they have neither connection with space-time (or momentum)
representation which we need for a dynamical description. This representation
one should obtain by the introduction of a local dynamical space-time [19, 20].
We saw that SU (N ) geometry gives the shape and the orientation of the
ellipsoid associated with the “average” of dynamical variable given by a quadric
If it is taking “as given” it show only primitive eigen-
form < F
value problem. But if one rises the question about real operational sense of the
quantum measurement of this dynamical variable or the process of the transition
from one eigen-state to another, one sees that quantum state and dynamical
variable involved in much more complicated relations that it is given in the
orthodox quantum scheme. The simple reason for this is that the decomposition
(representation) of the state vector of a quantum system strongly depends on the
spectrum and eigen-vectors of its dynamical variable. Overloaded system of the
GCS’s supplies us by enough big “reserve” of functions but their superposition
should be local and they span a tangent space at any speciﬁc point of CP (N
1)
marked by the local coordinates.

The “probability” may be introduced now by pure geometric way like cos2φ

in tangent state space as follows.

The notion of the “probability” is of course justiﬁed by our experience since
diﬀerent kinds of ﬂuctuations prevent the exact knowledge of any quantum
dynamical variable. That is not only because the uncertainty relation be-

5 The geometric way of the gauge ﬁeld genera-

tion

The fundamental gauge ﬁeld coming “from nowhere” in the models of elemen-
tary particles, and both Abelian [22] and non-Abelian [23] pseudo-potentials
associated with adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation, have formally ge-
ometric origins but of a diﬀerent nature. Pseudo-potentials have a singular
source of monopole-like type whose nature arose under degeneration, etc. But
the mathematical artefact (singularity of mapping) cannon be a reason for phys-
ical phenomenon. Dirac put the monopole as a physical source of electromag-
netic ﬁeld. He assumed that singularities are concentrated on some “line of the
knots” in the physical space. However, the monopoles do not exist up to now
as physical object; one should have clear mechanism of the non-integrability of
the phase (or action functional).

The question is:

is it possible to ﬁnd a non-singular fundamental gauge
potential if one uses not artiﬁcial parameter space, but an inherently related
projective Hilbert space CP (N

1).

I argue that in the framework of my model the reason of anholonomy is
lurked in the curvature of the dynamical group manifold and its invariant sub-
manifold CP (N
1). The “fundamental” interaction is generated by the coset
transformations [13]. Their geometry is the true source of some physical ﬁelds. It
means that under the aﬃne parallel transport of LDV’s agrees with the Fubini-
Study metric and there is some anholonomy depending on the curvature of
CP (N

1).

tensor). There are two important diﬀerences between original Berry’s formula
referring to arbitrary parameters and this 2-form in local coordinates inherently
connected with eigen-problem.

1. The Vik∗(πi) is the singular-free expression.
2. It does not contain two eigen-values, say, En, Em explicitly , but implicitly
Vik∗ depends locally on the choice of single λp through the dependence in local

6 Objective Quantum Measurement

New scientiﬁc paradigm concerns the concept of the Muliverse or omnium [1]
where universal laws of Universe may be contravened. I assume that this as-
sumption is premature since it is based on very speculative models of extended

17

quantum objects. I assume instead that our Universe has in fact inﬁnite dimen-
sion (even the state of a single hydrogen atom belongs to Hilbert space) but
quantum measurement reduce locally the Universe Geometry (UG) down to 4D
dynamical space-time whose geometry is a function of the state of the measure-
ment setup. It means that metric, connection, curvature, etc. of the dynamical
space-time (DST), are microscopically state-dependent. Such reduction during
objective quantum measurement will be described below; this procedure leads
to diﬀerent kind of the extended quantum objects - “ﬁeld shell” of GCS.

Deﬁnitely, it is impossible mathematically describe the state of some real
j(p) ) of some action operator ˆS =
j(p), ..., πN −1
quantum setup. I will use a GCS (π1
¯hA( ˆη+ ˆη) representing physically distinguishable states. This means that any
two points of CP (N
1) deﬁne two ellipsoids diﬀer at least by the orientations,
if not by the shape, as it was discussed above.
I assume that there is expectation state

Then accelerations a1, a2, a3 and angle velocities ω1, ω2, ω3 may be found in the
linear approximation from the equation

η + δη = Lη

(59)

as functions of the “logical spin 1/2” spinor components depending on local
coordinates (π1, ..., πN −1).

Hence the inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformations deﬁne small “space-time”
coordinates variations. It is convenient to take Lorentz transformations in the
following form ct′ = ct + (~x~a)dτ,
~x)dτ , where I put
~a = (a1/c, a2/c, a3/c),
~ω = (ω1, ω2, ω3) [24] in order to have for τ the physical
dimension of time. The coordinates xµ of points in this space-time serve in fact
merely for the parametrization of deformations of the “ﬁeld shell” arising under
its motion according to non-linear ﬁeld equations [19, 20, 25].

7 Field equations in the dynamical space-time

The energetic packet - “particle” associated with the “ﬁeld shell” is now de-
scribed locally by the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld ~H = ¯hΩαΦi
∂
∂πi + c.c. Our aim
α
is to ﬁnd the wave equations for Ωα in the dynamical space-time intrinsically
connected with the objective quantum measurement.

−

At each point (π1, ..., πN −1) of the CP (N

1) one has an “expectation value”
of the ~H deﬁned by a measuring device. But a displaced GCS may by reached
along one of the continuum paths. Therefore the comparison of two vector ﬁelds
and their “expectation values” at neighboring points requires some natural rule.
The comparison makes sense only for the same “particle” or for its “ﬁeld shell”
along some path. For this reason one should have an identiﬁcation procedure.
The aﬃne parallel transport in CP (N
1) of vector ﬁelds is a natural and the
−
simplest rule for the comparison of corresponding “ﬁeld shells”. Physically the
identiﬁcation of “particle” literally means that its Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld is a
Fubini-Study covariant constant.

Let me apply this parallel transport to the local Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld
H i = ¯hΩαΦi
α. The invariant classiﬁcation of the LDV’s given above shows that
~Hb = ¯hΩbΦi
∂
∂πi describes the velocity of the shape variation of the “ellipsoid of
b
polarization”, but ~Hh = ¯hΩhΦi
∂
∂πi gives the variation velocity of the orientation
h
of this ellipsoid in iso-space. Therefore Ωh may be treated as “pure gauge ﬁelds”
whereas Ωb are “matter ﬁeld” whose the mass spectrum Mb = ¯hΩb/c2 gives the
axes of the deformed ellipsoid.

Since we have only the unitary ﬁelds Ωα as parameters of the GCS trans-
formations we assume that in accordance with an super-equivalence principle
[4, 13] under the inﬁnitesimal variation of the unitary ﬁeld δΩα in the dynamical
space-time, the shifted Hamiltonian ﬁeld should coincide with the inﬁnitesimal
shift of the tangent Hamiltonian ﬁeld generated by the parallel transport in
CP (N

1) during world time δτ [18]. Thus one has

between them and vµ is not clear. The second question is: how one can get
1)2 equation for pure gauge ﬁelds Ωh? Probably they relate to Killing

CONCLUSION
1.

It is proposed the generalized (in comparison with “2-level” case [4])
the intrinsically geometric scheme of the quantum measurement of an arbi-
trary Hermitian “N-level” dynamical variable. The interaction arose due to
the breakdown of G = SU (N ) symmetry is used for such measurement and
it is represented by the aﬃne gauge “ﬁeld shell” propagated in the dynamical
state-dependent space-time.

2. The concept of “super-relativity” [13] is in fact a diﬀerent kind of attempts
In distinguish
of “hybridization” of the internal and space-time symmetries.
from SUSY where a priori exists the “extended space-time - super-space”, in my
approach the dynamical space-time arises only as a parametrization of SU (N )
local dynamical variables under “yes/no” quantum question.

3. The pure local formulation of theory in CP (N

1) leads seemingly to
the decoherence [4]. We may, of course, to make mentally the concatenation of
any two quantum systems living in direct product of their state spaces. The
variation of the one of them during a measurement may lead formally to some

−

21

variations in the second one. Unavoidable ﬂuctuations in our devices may even
conﬁrm predictable correlations. But the introduction of the state-dependent
dynamical space-time evokes a necessity to reformulate the Bell’s inequalities
which may lead then to a diﬀerent condition for the coincidences.

−

4. The locality in the quantum phase space CP (N

1) leads to extended
quantum particles - “ﬁeld shell” that obey the quasi-linear PDE [19, 20, 25]. The
physical status of their solutions is the open question. But if they somehow really
connected with “elementary particles”, say, electrons, then the plane waves of de
Broglie should not be literally refer to the state vector of the electron itself but
rather to covector (1-form) realized, say, as a periodic cristall lattice. The fact
that the condition for diﬀraction is in nice agreement with experiments may
be explained that for this agreement it is important only relative velocity of
electron and the lattice. The fact that momentum of electron pk = ∂W
∂qk and the
group velocity vk = dqk
dt should be in opposite directions may be easy proved.
Schr¨odinger [9] pointed out that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the material
point with the unit mass m = 1

may be understood as describing the surfaces of constant phase of the action
waves. If

∂W

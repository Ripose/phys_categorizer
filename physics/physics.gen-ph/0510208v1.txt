Abstract

In this comment it is pointed out that the perturbative dynamics of general mas-
sive ﬁeld theories can be mapped to delimited sums of determined integral functions.
The limits on the sums are the remaining obstacle to ﬁnding the general g-loop, or
derivative expanded, form of the scattering.

In previous works the classical scattering of scalar and gauge ﬁeld theories has
been formulated with the use of partitions of numbers [1],[2]. The use of the classical
scattering has been used in the formulation of the perturbative quantum dynamics
[3],[4]. There are simpliﬁcations in the quantum scattering with the use of the deter-
mined integral functions, presented in [3]. The content of this letter is to show that
the perturbative dynamics of a general massive theory can be reduced to the, as yet
delimited, sums of numbers parameterizing the products of these integral functions.
In massive φ3 theory, with coupling g, the scattering takes on the form [3],

gLmq

Y snij

B(ni, mi, wi) ,

with the parameters ni, mi and wi. There are conditions on the sum which depend on
the loop order L and the kinematic conﬁguration of nij. The B functions are integral
moments deﬁned and calculated in [1].

The simplest example is symmetry breaking in QED,

L = −

F 2 +

∇φ†∇φ + ¯ψaγµ∇µψa ,

with ∇µ = ∂µ + gAµ; the masses of the fermion and scalar are left non-zero. The
vacuum value of the scalar is chosen as,

∇φ†∇φ = ∂φ†∂φ + 2gA(v + φ)⋆∂φ + c.c. + g|v + φ|2A2 ,

which gives a mass to the gauge ﬁeld.

The non-abelian guage theory is deﬁned by,

L = −

with the covariant derivatives,

∇ = ∂ + gA

∇µφa = ∂µφa + g[φ, Aµ]a .

The symmetry breaking could be achieved as in the standard SU(N) → U(1), with
additional interactions to give masses to the abelian ﬁelds.

One example of symmetry breaking is as follows,

The mass term is

+ g2TrTc[Ta, Tb] (vb + φb)Ac∂µφa .

(va + φa)(va + φa)AbAb − [(va + φa)Aa]2

The vacuum expectation values are chosen uniformly va = vηa (η2 = 1), so that

v2A2 − v2η · A2 = v2[A2 − (X ηaAa)2]

= v2

X(1 − η2

which can be used to give mass to all of the the gauge ﬁelds. The gauge ﬁxing term
could be written in axial gauge as v2(η·A)2, and makes the uniform breaking manifest.

In three dimensions, a gauge invariant mass could be generated with the topo-

logical term

without any use of the scalar ﬁelds.

The gauge scattering, with n external gauge ﬁeld states, then takes on the form,

m

i=1

εi · ρj gq mp1

φ Y snij

ij X Y

B(ni, mi, wi) ,

with the possible tensors

ρj = ǫj

or kj .

The complete quantum gauge scattering then is produced by the appropriate sum-
mations on the indices in the sum in (13). This expansion depends on the helicity
conﬁguration in (14), that is choosing the contractions of momenta or helicities as ρi,
with m ranging from n/2 to n (all polarizations or all momenta as ρi).

In the example of a three dimensional gauge ﬁeld with the mass term, the form

is simpler,

i=1

εi · ρj gLmp

(15)

with the indices on the sum reﬂecting the dynamics of the three dimensional massive
gauge theory. The summations on the B functions depend on the helicity conﬁgura-
tion and the powers of the coupling.

In any theory with the mass generation for the gauge ﬁelds, and with non-zero
values for the remaining particle content, there is an expansion of the form (1), (13),
or (15), with the appropriate mass values used in their forms. The integral functions
B(ni, mi, wi) are determined. The completion of the quantum scattering is determined
by the appropriate summations of the indices. The required non-analyticity due to
unitarity, such as ln(s − m2) is found by resumming the polynomial terms.

These summations on the indices are potentially determined through a simple
context, such as the use of some analog of the Hopf algebra associated with the
tree diagrams. The determination of the sum limits in the scattering determines the
perturbative quantum scattering, with possible redundancy in the sums, and in a
general massive theory with various particle content.

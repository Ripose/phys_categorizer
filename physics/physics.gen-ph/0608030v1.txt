Manifestly Covariant Relativity 1

Abstract

According to Einstein’s principle of general covariance, all laws of nature
are to be expressed by manifestly covariant equations. In recent work, the
covariant law of energy-momentum conservation has been established. Here,
we show that this law gives rise to a fully covariant theory of gravitation and
that Einstein’s ﬁeld equations yield total energy-momentum conservation.

four related articles which are listed on page 5.

“The general laws of nature are to be expressed by equa-
tions which hold good for all systems of coordinates, that is, are
covariant with respect to any substitutions whatever (generally
covariant).”[1]

The great beauty of Einstein’s theory of general relativity has been justly
celebrated over the decades. The mathematical beauty of the theory consists
in the property of manifest covariance. The gravitational ﬁeld equations are
covariant, as are the accompanying equations of motion and Maxwell’s ﬁeld
equations. The stress-energy-momentum of matter and electromagnetism
form covariant expressions, as well. Finally, the covariant Bianchi identities
provide closure to the overall geometric structure. Nevertheless, there comes
a point at which the beauty and simplicity of the theory abruptly end. In
his treatment of energy-momentum, Einstein expressed the diﬀerential law
of conservation in terms of the ordinary divergence [2]

∂√

g T µν

−
∂xν

= 0

This gave rise to the gravitational stress-energy-momentum pseudotensors
[1–6]. These energy pseudotensors are decidedly lacking in simplicity. They
are not covariant expressions, therefore the components can take on arbi-
trary values, including zero [3,4]. The conclusion has been reached that
the pseudotensors can have no physical meaning [3], and that no deﬁnite
statement can be made regarding the density of gravitational energy in any
given region of space-time [5]. It is said that gravitational energy is ‘non-
localizable’, that it is not observable [6], and that it is meaningless to talk
of whether or not there is gravitational energy at a given place [2]. All of
this stands in marked contrast to the stress-energy-momentum of matter
and electromagnetism, which is both perfectly well-deﬁned and physically
observable.

Recently, it has been shown that equation (1) does not properly account
for energy-momentum. The correct expression of conservation is given by
the covariant divergence [7,8]

under uniform displacement in space-time [7]. This new law of conservation
is the key to forming a fully covariant theory of gravitation. We begin with
Einstein’s gravitational ﬁeld equations

T µν represents the stress-energy-momentum of electromagnetism and mat-
ter. The covariant divergence of the left-hand side is identically zero, there-
fore

T µν
;ν = 0

This equation means that the energy-momentum of matter and electro-
magnetism is conserved.
In other words, there is no exchange of energy-
momentum with the gravitational ﬁeld. The inevitable conclusion to be
drawn from this is that the gravitational ﬁeld, itself, has no dynamical
content—no energy, momentum, or stress. The elimination of the energy
pseudotensor removes the last vestige of non-covariance from Einstein’s the-
ory of gravitation. All physically meaningful expressions are now manifestly
covariant.

The absence of gravitational ﬁeld energy implies that gravitational forces
do not exist. We can demonstrate force-free planetary motion by means
of a direct appeal to the equations of motion. The equation of motion
for charged matter is found by substituting the energy tensors of matter
and electromagnetism into equation (7) and then making use of Maxwell’s
equations:

Einstein has stated that the term Γµ
νλuνuλ is to be interpreted as follows:
“The gravitational ﬁeld transfers energy and momentum to the matter, in
that it exerts forces upon it and gives it energy” [9]. However, all connection
coeﬃcients Γµ
νλ can be transformed to zero in any given inﬁnitesimal region
(geodesic coordinates) [10]. Therefore, no real physical transfer of energy-
momentum may be assigned to this term. (By way of contrast, the Lorentz
αJ α is covariant and cannot be transformed to zero.) We conclude
force F µ
that a planet moves through the gravitational ﬁeld in force-free geodesic
motion. The ﬁeld itself is inherently curved, and this is revealed by the
curved planetary trajectory. Only a real physical force, such as the Lorentz
force, could transfer energy-momentum to the planet and cause it to deviate
from its geodesic path.

The components of the matter tensor T µν = c2ρuµuν obviously change
during geodesic motion. The question then arises as to whether the energy-
momentum of the planet is, in fact, conserved. The physical density of stress-
energy-momentum is not given merely by the above tensor components, but
by the coordinate-independent expression

In order to investigate conservation, we form the divergence [11]

T = eµ

This is zero by virtue of the equation of motion. As a planet moves along
its orbit, the basis vectors eµ change in magnitude and direction such that
T = 0 and the energy-momentum of the planet is conserved. Similar
∇
considerations apply to time-dependent gravitational ﬁelds, in general, and
to the emission and absorption of gravitational waves, in particular. Con-
servation of total energy-momentum is assured, if Einstein’s gravitational
ﬁeld equations are satisﬁed.

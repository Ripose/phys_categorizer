We have shown previously that the mass of the muon neutrino can be determined
from the energy released in the decay of the π± mesons, and that the mass of the
electron neutrino can be determined from the energy released in the decay of the
neutron. We will now show how the mass of the tau neutrino can be determined
from the decay of the D±

s mesons.

1 Introduction

As we have shown with the standing wave model of the stable mesons and
baryons [1] it follows from the decay of the π± mesons that the mass of the
muon neutrinos νµ and ¯νµ must be m(νµ) = m(¯νµ) = 47.5 meV/c2. We have
also found in [1] that it follows from the decay of the neutron that the mass
of the antielectron neutrino ¯νe should be m(¯νe) = 0.55 meV/c2. We have
to correct this value whose calculation was based on the assumption that
the neutron, whose mass is ≈ 2K ±, is the superposition of a K + and a K −
meson. However, our investigation of the spin of the mesons and baryons [2]
has shown that such a superposition does not produce spin s = 1/2, as is
required. On the other hand, the superposition of two K 0 mesons has spin
s = 1/2; actually the neutron must be the superposition of a K 0 and a ¯K 0
meson, because of conservation of strangeness in the strong interaction that
created the neutron. According to the standing wave model the superposition
of a K 0 and a ¯K 0 consists of neutrinos only and their oscillation energy. The
neutrinos are arranged in a cubic lattice, each cell containing νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe
neutrinos. The total number of the neutrinos in the neutron is 4N, with N
= 2.854·109, twice as many neutrinos as if the neutron were a superposition
of K + and K −. That means that, when the neutron decays via n → p + e−
+ ¯νe, N antielectron neutrinos ¯νe share the diﬀerence ∆ of the energy in the
rest mass of the neutron and the energy in the rest mass of the proton ∆ =
1.29332 MeV. After the rest mass of the electron, also emitted in the decay

1

of the neutron, is subtracted from ∆, and ∆ − m(e)c2 = 0.782321 MeV is
divided by N, not by N/2 as in [1], we ﬁnd that the mass of the antielectron
neutrino must be

m(¯νe) = 0.275 meV/c2 .

(1)
From the decay of the antineutron ¯n → ¯p + e+ + νe follows in principle
that the mass of the electron neutrino should be m(νe) = 0.275 meV/c2, or
that m(νe) = m(¯νe).

2 The mass of ντ

We will now determine the mass of the τ neutrino m(ντ ) from the decay of the
D±
s mesons in a way which is analogous to the way how we have determined
the mass of νµ. The D±

s mesons decay via e.g.

D+
s

→ τ + + ντ (6.4%) ,

(2)

where τ + is the positive τ meson or lepton. The decay of D−
s has the conju-
gate particles on the right hand side of (2). The 6.4 percentage of this mode
of decay is, by a small margin, the most frequent of the leptonic modes of
decay of D±

s . The subsequent decay of τ ± is given by e.g.

τ + → π+ + ¯ντ (11.06%) ,
(3)
with the antitau neutrino ¯ντ . The percentage of this mode of decay of τ ± is
likewise only one of the very many modes of decay of τ ±.

If it is true, as we have postulated in [1], that the particles consist of the
particles into which they decay, then it follows from Eqs.(2,3) that the D±
s
mesons consist of ντ and ¯ντ neutrinos, plus the νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos in the
π± mesons in Eq.(3). The cells of the lattice of the D±
s mesons contain 6
types of neutrinos, not 4 types as in the π± mesons. The cubic lattice used
in the standing wave model can, however, be retained if we consider, instead
of a simple cubic lattice as the NaCl lattice, a body-centered cubic lattice in
which a particle diﬀerent from the particles in the corners of the simple cubic
cell sits at the center of each cell of the lattice. This seems to accomodate
only 5 neutrino types, whereas we have found that there must be 6 neutrino
types in the cells of the D±
s mesons. However, because of conservation of
lepton numbers during the creation of the D±
s mesons it is necessary that a

2

number of antitau neutrinos equal to the number of tau neutrinos is present
in the lattice. The antitau neutrinos can easily be accomodated in a lattice of
body-centered cells in which the center particles are alternately tau neutrinos
and antitau neutrinos.

As explained in [1] there must be N = 2.854·109 neutrinos in the π±
lattice, and consequently there are N/4 simple cubic cells in π±. The number
of cells in the π± lattice and the lattice of the neutron seem to be the same,
because the radii of the π± mesons and the proton are, within the accuracy
of the measurements, the same, and we assume that the size of the proton
and neutron are the same. It appears that the superposition of a K 0 and a
¯K 0 meson creating a neutron does not change the size of the lattice of these
particles, or the number of their cubic cells. We will therefore assume that
the superposition of a proton, an antineutron and a π0 meson creating the
D±
s ) = 0.978·( m(p) + m(¯n) + m(π0) ), does not change
the number of the cells in the lattice either. In other words we assume that
the size of the proton or neutron is the same as the size of the D±
s mesons. If
there are N/4 body-centered cells in the D±
s meson then there must be N/8
tau neutrinos and antitau neutrinos each in the lattice of D±
s . The energy ∆
released in the decay D+
s

→ τ + + ντ (Eq.(2)) is given by

s mesons, with m(D±

(4)

(5)

∆ = m(D±

s )c2 − m (τ ±)c2 = 191.51 MeV .

If this energy originates from the rest mass of all ντ neutrinos, respectively
from all ¯ντ neutrinos, in the decay of D±
s then it follows, with the number of
ντ or ¯ντ neutrinos being N/8, that

m(ντ ) = m(¯ντ ) = 536.8 meV/c2 ≈ 0.54 eV/c2 .

Since in the decay of D+

s only a single tau neutrino is emitted one must
wonder why the energy ∆ released in the decay should be equal to the sum
of the rest masses of all tau neutrinos in D+
s . The ﬁrst indication that ∆
is not the energy carried by a single tau neutrino in the D+
s meson comes
from the magnitude of ∆ which amounts to practically 10% of the energy in
the rest mass of D+
s . This is incompatible with the basic tenet that there
must be, according to Fourier analysis, a continuum of frequencies in a body
created in a high energy collision of 10−23 sec duration, which does not make
it possible that a single neutrino out of 109 neutrinos has a rest mass plus an
oscillation energy amounting to 10% of the rest mass of D±
s . That the source
of ∆ is the rest masses of all ντ , respectively ¯ντ , neutrinos can be inferred

3

from the disappearance of one of the two neutrino types in the secondary
decays following the primary decay of D±
s . To be speciﬁc, the ντ in the
decay of D+
s (Eq.(2)) does not appear neither in the decay of τ + (Eq.(3))
nor in the subsequent decay of π+ which is in also (3), nor in the decay of
the µ+ meson which follows. With the primary decay of D+
s , (Eq.(2)), the
tau neutrinos seem to have been eliminated, which will certainly be the case
when the energy of the rest masses of all ντ has been consumed by ∆. This
process is analogous to the disappearance of one type of muon neutrino after
the decay of the π± mesons, as discussed in [1], where we have shown that
the oscillation energy of all neutrinos in π± is conserved in the decay, where
therefore the energy in the emitted neutrino can come only from the sum of
the rest masses of all neutrinos of the type of neutrino emitted in the decay.
s meson
leads also to the correct spin s(D±
s ) = 0. We have shown in [2] and [3], e.g.
in context with the spin of the π± mesons s(π±) = 0, that the spin of the
electric charge carried by the π± mesons is canceled by the sum of the spin
vectors of all neutrinos in the lattice. Of all the spin vectors of the O(109)
neutrinos in the cubic lattice of the π± mesons only the spin vector of the
central neutrino remains, which then cancels the spin vector of the electric
charge. The same applies for the body-centered lattice of the D±
s mesons. Of
the spin vectors of all neutrinos in the D±
s lattice only the spin vector of the
central neutrino, in this case of a ντ or ¯ντ neutrino, remains which cancels
the spin vector of the electric charge of D±
s ) = 0, as it
must be.

Finally we want to show that the body-centered lattice of the D±

s . Consequently s(D±

3 Conclusions

→ τ ± + ντ (¯ντ ) we can show
Making use of the decay of the D±
that the mass of the tau neutrino must be m(ντ ) ≈ 0.54 eV/c2. We also ﬁnd
that m(ντ ) = m(¯ντ ).

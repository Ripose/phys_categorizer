Abstract

A new systematization of various theoretical approaches to deﬁning tun-

nelling times for nonrelativistic particles in the light of time as a quantum–

mechanical observable is given. Then new results on the analogy between

particle and photon tunnelling and on time as an observable in quantum elec-

trodynamics and also analysis of the causality validity during tunneling are

presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

Tunnelling time analysis has a long history. The problem of deﬁning the tunnelling time

was posed already in the beginning of the 30–th [1,2]. But from then it was remained almost

ignored until the 50–60–th when the more general problem of deﬁning the quantum–collision

duration began to be investigated [3–14] and almost simultaneously, after a long period of

the silence from the 20–th induced by the Pauli theorem about the impossibility to construct

1

the self–adjoint time operator in quantum mechanics [15], the ﬁrst attempts appeared to

introduce the notion of time as a quantum–mechanical observable [16–22]. And during the

70–80–th (mainly in [23–25]) the membership of time in the set of quantum–mechanical

observables had been principally cleared up. The detailed analysis of developments in the

study of time as a quantum–physical observable is contained in [25–27].

The developments in physics of condensed media, physics of electromagnetic–wave prop-

agation, biophysics and especially the advent of high–speed electronic devices, based on

tunnelling processes, revived an interest in the tunnelling time analysis, whose relevance has

always been apparent in physics of nuclear sub–barrier ﬁssion and fusion, and stimulated

the publication of not only a lot of theoretical studies but already a number of theoretical

reviews [28–36].

Regarding the experimental research of tunnelling times, the great diﬃculties of real

measurements for particles (in particular, too small values of tunnelling times) made the

veriﬁcations of theoretical results to be practically impossible (see, for instance, [37,38]).

Only recently there were realized some measurements of tunnelling times for microwaves

and laser–light photons [39–42]. In what sense the results of these experiments are suitable

for the time analysis of particle tunnelling ? Although the formal analogy of particle and

photon (electromagnetic wave–packet) tunnelling is well seen by simple comparing the rele-

vant stationary equations [43–46], actually we deal with the time–dependent equations and

moreover, the problem of time as an observable also in quantum electrodynamics must be

resolved too. Below (in Sec.7) these questions will be explicitly analyzed.

Returning to the problem of the theoretical deﬁnition of the tunnelling time for parti-

cles, we see not only the absence of the consensus in such deﬁnition but also declarations

about the incompatibility of some approaches both quantitatively and in the physical in-

terpretation [28–36]. Among the reasons of such situation there are the following ones: (i)

the problem of deﬁning the tunnelling time is closely connected with general fundamental

problems of time as a quantum–physical observable and the general deﬁnition of quantum–

collision durations. And the acquaintance with the principal solution of these problems have

2

not got a wide prevalence yet. (ii) The motion of particles inside a potential barrier is a

quantum phenomenon without any direct classical limit. (iii) There are essential diﬀerences

in initial, boundary and external conditions of various deﬁnition schemes which have not

been systematically analyzed yet.

Following [36,47], we can arrange the majority of approaches into several groups which are

based on: (1) the time–dependent wave–packet description; (2) averaging over an introduced

set of kinematics paths, distribution of which is supposed to describe the particle motion

inside the barrier; (3) introducing a new degree of freedom, constituting a physical clock for

measurements of tunnelling times. Separately, by one’s self, the dwell time stands. The last

has ab initio the presumptive meaning of the time that the incident ﬂux has to be turned

on, to provide the accumulated particle storage in the barrier [5,36].

The ﬁrst group contains the so–called phase times, ﬁrstly mentioned in [3,4] and applied

to tunnelling in [48,49], the times of the motion of wave–packet spatial centroids, earlier

considered for general quantum collisions in [13,14] and applied to tunnelling in [50,51],

and ﬁnally the Olkhovsky–Recami (O–R) method [35,52,53] of averaging over unidirectional

ﬂuxes, basing on the representation of time as a quantum–mechanical observable and on the

generalization of the deﬁnitions,introduced in [7,25,26] for atomic and nuclear collisions. The

second group contains methods, utilizing the Feynman path integrals [54–57], the Wigner

distribution paths [58,59] and the Bohm approach [60]. To the third group the approaches

with the Larmor clock [61] and the oscillatory barrier [62,63] pertain.

Certainly the basic self–consistent deﬁnition of tunnelling durations (mean values, vari-

ances of distributions and so on) has to be elaborated quite similarly to the deﬁnitions of

other physical quantities (distances, energies, momenta, etc.,) on the base of utilizing all

necessary properties of time as a quantum–physical observable (time operator, canonically

conjugated to energy operator; the equivalency of the averaged quantities in time and energy

representations with adequate measures, or weights, of averaging). Since the representation

of solutions of the time–dependent Schr¨odinger equation as moving wave packets is typical

and the most self–consistent in quantum collision theory (see, for instance, [6, ref.3], it is

3

natural to apply the wave–packet description. Then one can hope that in the framework

of the conventional quantum mechanics every known deﬁnition of tunnelling times can be

shown, after appropriate analysis, to be (at least in the asymptotic region, used for typical

boundary conditions in quantum collision theory) either a particular case of the general def-

inition or an equivalent one or the deﬁnition which is valid not for tunnelling but for some

accompanying process, diﬀerent from tunnelling.

Here such a deﬁnition with the necessary formalism is presented (Sec.2) and, without

claiming to present the exhaustive analysis of all known deﬁnitions, then analysis of various

approaches is given (Sec.3–5), basing on the O–R formalism. In Sec.6 some peculiarities of

tunnelling evolution revealed by use of the O–R method are presented, then, after Sec.7,

there is a short note on the reshaping (and reconstructing) phenomenon in connection with a

possible formulation of relativistic causality in the cases of superluminal eﬀective tunnelling

velocities (Sec.8) and ﬁnally in Sec.9 some conclusions and reasonings on nearest prospects

are presented.

II. THE OLKHOVSKY–RECAMI FORMALISM OF DEFINING TUNNELLING

DURATIONS, BASED ON UTILIZING PROPERTIES OF TIME AS A

QUANTUM–MECHANICAL OBSERVABLE AND THE WAVE–PACKET

DESCRIPTION.

We conﬁne ourselves to the simplest case of particles moving only along the x–direction,

and consider a time–independent barrier in the interval (0, a); see Fig. 1, in which a larger

interval (xi, xf ), containing the barrier region, is also indicated. Following the deﬁnition of

collision durations, put forth in [7,23,25,26] and generalized in [35,52,54], we can eventually

deﬁne the mean values of the time at which a particle passes through position x, travelling

in the positive or negative direction of the x–axis, and the variances of the distributions of

these times, respectively, as

4

< t±(x) > =

t2J±(x, t) dx

and

and

where J±(x, t) = Re[(i¯h/m)(Ψ(x, t))(∂Ψ∗(x, t)/∂x)] being the probability ﬂux density for an

evolving wave packet Ψ(x, t). We recall here the equivalence of time and energy represen-

tations, with appropriate measures of averaging, in the following sense: < . . . >t=< . . . >E

(index t is omitted in all expression for < . . . >t for the sake of the simplicity). This equiva-

lence is a consequence of the time–operator existence. So, we have a formalism for deﬁning

mean values, variances and other central moments related to the duration distributions of

all possible kinds of collisions and interactions with arbitrary energies, including tunnelling.

For instance, for transmissions from region I to region III, we have

< τT (xi, xf ) >=< t+(xf ) > − < t+(xi) >

DτT (xi, xf ) = Dt+(xf ) − Dt+(xi)

with −∞ < xi ≤ 0 and a ≤ xf < ∞. For a pure tunnelling process one has

< τtun(0, a) >=< t+(a) > − < t+(0) >

Dτtun(0, a) = Dt+(a) + Dt+(0).

Similar expression we have for the penetration (into the barrier region II) temporal

quantities < τpen(xi, xf ) > and Dτpen(xi, xf ) with 0 < xf < a. For reﬂections in any point

xf ≤ a one has

< τR(xi, xf ) >=< t−(xf ) > − < t+(xi) >

(7)

(6)

and

and

we get

where

and

DτR(xi, xf ) = Dt−(xf ) + Dt+(xi).

We stress that these deﬁnitions hold within the framework of conventional quantum

mechanics, without introducing any new physical postulate.

In the asymptotic cases, when |xi| >> a ,

AT exp(ikx) and ψin = exp(ikx) respectively.

approximation when (11) is valid and with a small contribution of Dt+(xi) into the vari-

ance DτT (xi, xf ) (that can be realized for suﬃciently large energy spreads, i.e., short wave

packets), we get

DτT (xi, xf ) = ¯h2 < (d|AT |/dE)2 >E

< |AT |2 >E .

(13)

.

For the opposite case of very small energy spreads (quasi–monochromatic particles) ex-

pression (13) becomes the item of Dt+(xf ) and DτT (xi, xf ) which is born by the barrier

inﬂuence.

When |G|2 → δ(E − E), E being ¯h2k

2

T (xi, xf ) >∼=< τ ph

T (xi, xf ) >E

strictly the ordinary phase time, without averaging. For a rectangular barrier with height

V0 and χa >> 1 ( where χ = [2m(V0 − E)]1/2/¯h), the expressions ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) for xi = 0

and xf = a pass, in the same limit, into the known expressions

( see [48] and also [35,36] ) and

τ ph
tun = 2/vχ

(Dτ ph

(14)

(15)

(coincident with one of the Larmor times [61] and the B¨uttiker–Landauer time [63] and

also the imaginary part of the complex time in the Feynman path–integration approach)

respectively (see also [64]).

For the real weight amplitude G(k − k), when < t(0) >in= 0, from (10), we obtain

< τtun(0, a) >=< tph

tun > − < t+(0) > .

(16)

By the way, if the measurement conditions are chosen to be such that only the positive–

momentum components of wave packets are registered, i.e., Λexp,+Ψ(xi, t) = Ψin(xi, t); Λexp,+

being the projector onto positive–momentum states, then for any xi from (−∞, 0) and xf

from (a, ∞)

7

and

< τT (xi, xf ) >exp=< tph

T (xi, xf ) >E

< τtun(0, a) >exp=< tph

tun >E

(17)

(18)

because < t(0) >exp=< t(0) >in .

The main criticism, by authors of [36,51] and also [60,65], of any approach to the deﬁni-

tion of tunnelling times, in which spatial or temporal averaging over moving wave packets is

used, implies the lack of a causal relationship in evolution of an incoming peak or centroid,

turning into an outgoing peak or centroid. It is clear already from the 60–th (see, for instance,

[14] ) that these reasonings are particularly true only for the spatial approach with ﬁnite

(not asymptotic) distances from the interaction region. And this criticism concerns only the

attempts of the authors of [51] to trace evolution of an incoming peak into an outgoing one

but not, strictly speaking, the O–R deﬁnition of collision, tunnelling, transmission, penetra-

tion, reﬂection, durations, etc; our deﬁnition of the mean duration of any such process is, by

no means, based on the assumption that the centroid (or peak) of the incident wave packet

directly evolves into the centroid (or peak) of the transmitted and reﬂected packets, as it was

erroneously claimed in [65], but does simply signify the diﬀerence between the mean time

values of the passing of the ﬁnal and initial wave packets through the appropriate points,

regardless of any intermediate motion, transformation and reshaping of these wave packets.

And for any collision (and so on) processes, as a whole, one can test the causality condition.

However, there is no unique general formulation of the causality condition, necessary and

suﬃcient for all possible cases of collisions (and not only for nonrelativistic wave packets,

but also for relativistic ones). The simplest (or the most strong) nonrelativistic causality

condition implies the non–negative values of the mean durations. However, this is a suﬃ-

cient but not the necessary causality condition. Negative times (advance phenomena) were

revealed even near nuclear resonances, distorted by the non–resonant background (see, in

particular, [26] ); similarly, advance phenomena can occur at the beginning of tunnelling (see

Sec.6). Generally speaking, the complete causality condition can be connected not only with

8

the mean time duration but also with other temporal properties of the considered process.

For example, the following variant of the causality condition seems to be somewhat more

realistic: the diﬀerence between the eﬀective starts of ﬁnal and initial ﬂuxes is non–negative,

the eﬀective start being deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the mean instant of wave–packet

passing through the appropriate point and the square root of the corresponding instant–

distribution variance. And also this condition is only suﬃcient but not necessary because in

many realistic cases wave packets have inﬁnite and not very rapidly decreasing forward tails.

Much more realistic formulations of the causality conditions for wave packets with inﬁnite

tails are presented in Sec.8.

III. THE MEANING OF THE MEAN DWELL TIME IN THE LIGHT OF THE

OLKHOVSKY–RECAMI FORMALISM.

As it is known [66] (see also [52,53] ) the mean dwell time can be presented in two

with −∞ < xi ≤ 0; a ≤ xf < ∞ .

In its primary deﬁnition (19) another, than in

Sec.2, measure (weight) was used in integrating over t. What is that measure and what

is its meaning ? Taking into account equation

Jin(xi, t)dt =

|Ψ(x, t)|2dx , which fol-

lows from the continuity equation, one can easily see that this measure is dP (x, t) =

R

R

|Ψ(x, t)|2dx/

|Ψ(x, t)|2dx and it has the well–known quantum–mechanical meaning of the

probability for a particle to be found (localized) or to stay (dwell), in the spatial region

R

(x, x + dx) at the moment t, independently on the motion processes. Then the quantity

P (x1, x2; t) =

x2

x1 |Ψ(x, t)|2dx/
R

∞
−∞ |Ψ(x, t)|2dx has the evident meaning of the probability
R

9

of particle dwelling in the spatial range (xi, xf ) at the moment t (see also [67]. And the

equivalency of relations (19) and (20) is a consequence of the continuity equation which

connects the staying (dwelling) and the motion (traversing, transferring, passing, entering,

outgoing) processes. However, we note that the applicability of the measure P (x1, x2; t) for

the time analysis (in contrast to the space analysis) is limited since it serves directly for

calculations of only dwelling durations but not of their distributions.

Taking into account that J(xi, t) = Jin(xi, t) + JR(xi, t) + Jint(xi, t) and J(xf , t) =

JT (xf , t) with Jin, JR and JT corresponding to the wave packets Ψin(xi, t), ΨR(xi, t) and

ΨT (xf , t), constructed from the stationary wave functions Ψin, ΨR = ARexp(−ikx) and ΨT ,

Jint(x, t) = Re{(i¯h/m)[(Ψin(x, t))(∂Ψ∗

We stress that < r(x) > is negative and tends to 0 when x tends to −∞.

When Ψin(xi, t) and ΨR(xi, t) are well separated in time, i.e., < r(xi) >= 0, we obtain

the simple weighted average rule

10

(23)

(24)

(25)

< τ dw(xi, xf ) >=< T >E< τT (xi, xf ) > + < R >E< τR(xi, xi) > .

(22)

For a rectangular barrier with χa ≫ 1 and quasi–monochromatic particles, the expressions

(21) and (22) with xi = 0 and xf = a pass to the known expressions

< τ dw(xi, xf ) >=< ¯hk/χV0 >E

(taking account of the interference term < r(xi) > ) and

< τdw(xi, xf ) >=< 2/χv >E

(when the interference term < r(xi) > is equal to 0). When AR = 0, i.e., the barrier is

transparent, the mean dwell time (19), (20) is automatically equal to

< τ dw(xi, xf ) >=< τT (xi, xf ) > .

It is not clear how to deﬁne directly the variance of the dwell–time distribution. The ap-

proach, proposed in [68], is rather sophisticated, with an artiﬁcial abrupt switching on the

initial wave packet. It is possible to deﬁne the variance of the dwell–time distribution indi-

rectly, in particular, by means of relation (21), basing on the variances of the transmission–

time and reﬂection–time distributions, or by means of relation (19), basing on the variances

of the positions x1 and x2.

IV. ANALYSIS OF THE LARMOR AND B ¨UTTIKER–LANDAUER CLOCKS.

One can often realize that introducing additional degrees of freedom as ”clocks” distorts

the true value of the tunnelling time. The Larmor clock uses the phenomenon of changing the

spin orientation (The Larmor precession or spin–ﬂip) in a weak homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld

covered the barrier region. If initially the particle spin is polarized in the x direction, after

tunnelling the spin develops small y and z components. The Larmor time τ La

y,T and τ La

z,T are

deﬁned by the ratio of the spin–rotation angles around z–axis and y–axis (in turn deﬁned by

the developed y− and z–spin components respectively) to the precession (rotation) frequency

[9,10,61]. For an opaque rectangular barrier with χa ≫ 1 the expressions

11

< τ La

y,tun >=< τ dw(xi, xf ) >=< k/χV0 >E

< τ La

z,tun >=< ma/¯hχ >E

(26)

(27)

and

were obtained.

In [35,64] it was noted that, if the magnetic ﬁeld region is inﬁnite, the expression (26)

passes into the expression (14) for the phase tunnelling time, after averaging over the small

energy spread of the wave packet.

As to (27), in the reality we have not a precession but a jump to position “ spin–up”

or “spin–down” (spin–ﬂip) accompanyed by the Zeeman energy–level splitting [6,47]. Due

to the Zeeman splitting, the component of the spin, that is parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld,

corresponds to a higher tunnelling energy and hence it tunnels preferentially. And, namely,

therefore one can realize that this time is connected with the energy dependance of |AT | and

coincides with the expression (15).

The work of the B¨uttiker– Landauer clock is connected with the modulation cycle (ab-

sorption or emission of modulation quanta), caused by the oscillating part of a barrier, during

tunnelling. And also in this case, one can realize that the coincidence of the B¨uttiker–

Landauer time with (15) is connected with the energy dependence of |AT | for the same

reasons as for < τ La

z,tun >.

V. ANALYSIS OF THE MEAN TUNNELLING TIMES, DEFINED BY

AVERAGING OVER KINEMATIC PATHS.

The Feynman path–integral approach to quantum mechanics was applied in [54–57] to

study and calculate the mean tunnelling time averaged over all paths, that have the same

beginning and end, with the complex weight factor exp[iS(x(t)/¯h], where S is the action

associated with the path x(t). Namely such weighting of tunnelling times implies their

distribution with a real and an imaginary components [36]. In [54] the real and imaginary

12

parts of the obtained complex tunnelling time were found to be equal to τ La

y,tun and −τ La

z,tun

respectively.

An interesting development of this approach, the instanton version, is presented in [57].

The instanton–bounce path is a stationary point of the Euclidean action. The latter is

obtained by the analytic continuation to imaginary time in the Feynman path–integrals

containing the factor exp(iS/¯h) . This path obeys a classical equation of motion in the

potential barrier with the sign reversed. In [57] the instanton bounces were considered as a

real physical processes. The bounce duration was calculated in real time and was found to be

in good agreement with the one evaluated by the phase–time method. The temporal density

of bounces was estimated in imaginary time and the obtained result coincided with (13) for

the square root of the distribution variance at the limit of the phase–time approximation.

Here one can see a manifestation of the virtual equivalence of the Schr¨odinger representation

and the Feynman path–integral approach to quantum mechanics.

Another deﬁnition of the tunnelling time is connected with the Wigner distribution paths

[58,59]. The basic idea of this approach, ﬁnally formulated by Muga, Brouard and Sala, is

that the distribution of the tunnelling times in the dynamical evolution of wave packets

through barriers can be well approximated by a classical ensemble of particles with a certain

distribution function, namely the Wigner function f (x, p), so that the ﬂux at position x can

be separated into positive and negative components:

J(x) = J +(x) + J −(x)

(28)

with

J +(x) =

(p/m)f (x, p)dp

∞

Z
0

and J − = J − J + . Then formally the same expressions (3), (5) and (7) for the transmission,

tunnelling and penetration durations and so on, as in the O–R formalism, were obtained with

the substitution of J ± instead of our J±. The dwell time decomposition in this approach

takes the form

13

< τ dw(xi, xf ) >=< T >E< τT (xi, xf ) > + < RM (xi) >E< τR(xi, xi) >

(29)

with RM (x) =

|J −(x, t)|dt. Asymptotically RM (x) tends to < R >E and (29) takes

∞
0
R

formally the known form (22).

One more alternative is the stochastic method for wave packets [69]. It also leads to real

times but its numerical implementation is not trivial [59].

In [60] the Bohm approach to quantum mechanics was used to choose a set of classical

paths which do not cross. The Bohm formulation can provide, on the one hand, a strict

equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation, and on the other hand, a base for the nonstandard

interpretation of quantum mechanics [36]. The obtained expression in [60] for the mean dwell

time is not only positive deﬁnite but gives the unambiguous distinction between particles

that are transmitted or reﬂected:

τ dw(xi, xf ) =

|Ψ(x, t)|2dx = T τT (xi, xf ) + RτR(xi, xi)

Factually, in addition to the diﬀerence in the temporal integration in this and our formalism

VI. PECULIARITIES OF THE TUNNELLING EVOLUTION.

The results of calculations presented in [53], within the Olkhovsky–Recami formalism,

show that: (i) at variance with [70], no plot for the mean penetration duration of our wave

packets presents any interval with negative values, nor with a decreasing for increasing x;

(ii) the mean tunnelling duration does not depend on the barrier width a ( the Hartmann–

Fletcher eﬀect); (iii) the quantity < τtun(0, a) > decreases when the energy increases; (iv)

the value < τpen(0, x) > rapidly increases for increasing x near x = 0 and tends to an almost

saturation value near x = a.

In Fig.2 the dependences of the values of < τtun(0, a) > from a are presented for electronic

wave packets and rectangular barriers with the same parameters as in [53] (V0 = 10eV; mean

electron energies E = 2.5, 5, 7.5eV with ∆k = 0.02˚A−1 (curves 1a, 2a, 3a respectively); en-

ergy E = 5eV with ∆k = 0.06˚A−1 (curves 4a, 5a respectively) ). The curves, corresponding

to diﬀerent energies and k, merge practically into one curve, 6. And since the dependence of

< τ ph

tun > from a is very weak, the dependance of < τtun(0, a) > from a is deﬁned mainly by

the dependence of < t+(0) > from a (curves 1b–5b). All these calculations manifest the neg-

ative value of < t+(0) > from a (see also [71]). Such “a–causal” advance can be interpreted as

a result of the superposition and interference of incoming and reﬂected waves: the reﬂected–

wave packet extinguishes the back edge of the incoming–wave packet, and the larger is the

barrier width the larger is the part of the back edge of the incoming–wave packet which is

extinguished by the superimposing reﬂected–wave packet, up to the saturation, when the

contribution of the reﬂected–wave packet becomes almost constant, independently from a.

15

Besides all < t+(0) > are negative and the values of < τtun(0, a) > are always positive

and, moreover, larger than < τ ph

tun >, in accordance with (16). In connection with this , it

is relevant to note that the example with a classical ensemble of two particles (one with a

large above–barrier energy and the other with a small sub–barrier energy), presented in [72],

contradicts to our results not only because that tunnelling is a pure quantum phenomenon

without a direct classical limit but, ﬁrst of all, because in [72] it is overlooked the fact that

the values of < t+(0) > are negative (for our initial condition). The last calculations of

Zaichenko [71] ( for the same parameters) have shown that such advance is noticeable also

before the barrier front (however, only near the barrier wall) and, moreover, the values of

< τpen(xi, xf ) > are negative for xi = −a/5 and xf = 0, a/5, 2a/5 and a little larger values

of xf inside the barrier. But this result is not a–casual because the causality conditions (see

relations (47) and (48) in Sec.8) are fulﬁlled in this case.

VII. ABOUT THE ANALOGY BETWEEN NONRELATIVISTIC PARTICLE

AND PHOTON (ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE–PACKET) TUNNELLING.

The formal mathematical analogy between the time–dependent quantum equations for

the motion of relativistic particles and the time–dependent equation for electromagnetic

wave propagation was studied in [73,74]. Here, we shall deal with the comparison of the

solutions of the time–dependent Schr¨odinger equation for nonrelativistic particles and of

the time–dependent Helmholtz equation for electromagnetic waves, considering not only the

formal mathematical analogy between them, but also such similarity of the probabilistic

interpretation of the wave function for a particle and of a classical electromagnetic wave

packet, (being according to [75] the “wave function for a single photon”) which is suﬃcient

for the identical deﬁnition of mean time instants and durations (and distribution variances

and so on) of propagation, collision, tunnelling,etc., processes for particles and photons [76].

Concretely, we consider a hollow narrowed rectangular waveguide like depicted in Fig.3

(with cross section a × b of the narrow part, a < b ), which was employed for the ex-

16

periments with microwaves [39].

γ = 2π[(1/λ)2 − (1/λc)2]1/2,

(1/λc)2 = (m/2a)2 + (n/2b)2,

where γ is real (γ = Reγ) if λ < λc and γ is imaginary (γ = iχem) if λ > λc. Similar

expressions for γ were obtained for T H–waves [39,78].

Generally a solution of (35) can be written as a wave packet constructed from monochro-

matic solutions (37), similarly to a solution of the time–dependent Schr¨odinger equation

for nonrelativistic particles in the form of a wave packet constructed from monochromatic

17

wave function is usually described by a wave packet for

photon in the direction of its polarization, nevertheless, in a certain sense, for the one–

dimensional propagation, it is possible to use the space–time probabilistic interpretation of

(39) along x–axis (the propagation direction) [81]. Usually one uses not the probability

density and the probability ﬂux density with the corresponding continuity equation directly

but the energy density s0 and the energy ﬂux density sx (although, in general, they rep-

resent components of not a 4–dimensional vector but the energy–momentum tensor) with

the corresponding continuity equation [75] which we write in the two–dimensional (spatially,

one–dimensional) form:

where

∂s0/∂t + ∂sx/∂x = 0

(41)

and x–axis is directed along the motion direction (the mean momentum) of the wave packet

(39). We stress that for the spatially one–dimensional propagation the energy–momentum

tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld reduces to the two–component quantity, scalar term s0

and 1–dimensional vector term sx, for which continuity equation (40) is Lorentz–invariant.

Then, as a normalization condition, one choose the equality of the spatial integrals of s0 and

sx to the mean photon energy and the mean photon momentum respectively or simply the

18

unit energy ﬂux density sx. With this, by passing the problem of the impossibility of the

direct space probabilistic interpretation of (39), we can deﬁne conventionally the probability

density

of a photon to be found (localized) in the spatial interval (x, x + dx) along x–axis at the

of a photon to pass through point (plane) x in the time interval (t, t + dt), quite similarly to

the probabilistic quantities for particles. The justiﬁcation and convenience of such deﬁnitions

are also supported by the coincidence of the wave–packet group velocity and the velocity

of the energy transport which was established for electromagnetic waves (at least, in the

case of usual plane waves) in [82]. Hence, (i) in a certain sense, for time analysis along the

motion direction, the wave packet (39) is quite similar to a wave packet for nonrelativistic

particles and, (ii) similarly to the conventional nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, one can

deﬁne the mean time of photon (electromagnetic wave packet) passing through point x [81]

(where for the natural boundary conditions, κi(0) = κi(∞) = 0, in energy representation

(ǫ = ¯hck0), we can use the same form of time operator as for particles in nonrelativistic

quantum mechanics and hence verify the equivalence of calculations of < t(x) >, Dt(x),

etc., in both time and energy representations). Then, one can use the same interpretation

for the propagation of electromagnetic wave packets (photons) in media and waveguides

when collisions, reﬂections and tunnelling can take place. In particular, for waveguides ,like

depicted in Fig.3, with boundary conditions (36) and, decreasing and increasing waves when

kx = γ = iχem.

19

In the case of ﬂuxes which change their signs with time, we introduce, following [35,52,53],

quantities Jem,x,± = Jem,xΘ(±Jem,x) with the same physical meaning as for particles. There-

fore, expressions for mean values and variances of distributions of propagation, tunnelling,

transmission, penetration, and reﬂection durations can be obtained in the same way as in

the case of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics for particles (with the substitution of J by

Jem). In the particular case of quasi–monochromatic wave packets, using the stationary–

phase method under the same boundary and measurement conditions, as considered in Sec.2

for particles, we obtain the identical expression for the phase tunnelling time

From (45), we can see, that when χemL > 2 the eﬀective tunnelling velocity

tun,em = 2/cχem for χemL ≫ 1.

vef f

(45)

(46)

is more than c, i.e., superluminal. This result agrees with the results of the microwave–

tunnelling measurements presented in [39] (see also [40], where, moreover, the eﬀective tun-

nelling velocity was identiﬁed with the group velocity of the ﬁnal wave packet corresponding

to a single photon).

VIII. A REMARK ON RESHAPING (RECONSTRUCTING) PHENOMENON.

The superluminal phenomena, observed in the experiments with tunnelling photons

and evanescent electromagnetic waves [39–42], generated a lot of discussions on relativis-

tic causality. And, in connection with this, also an interest for similar phenomena, observed

for the electromagnetic pulse propagation in a dispersive medium [83–85], was revived. Al-

ready for long there was ascertained that the wave–front velocity of the electromagnetic

pulse propagation, when pulses have a step–function envelope, cannot exceed the velocity

of light c in vacuum [79,86]. There, the signal velocity was also deﬁned as the velocity

of the propagation of the pulse main part in a medium which was shown to be less than

20

the wave–front velocity. These conclusions were conﬁrmed by various methods and in var-

ious processes, including tunnelling [74,87–91]. In [79] the distinctions between the above

mentioned velocities and the group velocity were also analyzed.

One of the argued problems consists in the absence of a step–function form of forward

edges for realistic wave packets [74,91]. In such cases the conclusions of [79] can seem to

be inapplicable. Nevertheless an inﬁnite but suﬃciently rapidly decreasing forward edge of

a pulse can be cut oﬀ, with any desired degree of the accuracy, (deﬁned, for instance, by

a sensitivity of registration devices or a chosen mathematical approximation), without an

essential distortion of the pulse spectral expansion. This can give a possibility to apply the

conclusions of [79,86]. But independently from these reasonings, one can search a principal

understanding of cases with superluminal group velocities ( or eﬀective velocities, like (46))

without violations of special relativity or causality.

A possible way of such understanding can consist in explaining the superluminal phe-

nomena during tunnelling on the base of a pulse attenuated reshaping (or reconstructing)

discussed at the classical limit earlier by [83–85]. The later parts of an input pulse are prefer-

entially attenuated in such a way that the output peak appears shifted toward earlier times,

arising from the forward tail of the incident pulse in a strictly causal manner [40]. In par-

ticular, the following reasonable scheme is quite compatible with the usual idea of causality:

if an overall pulse attenuation is very strong and, in the same case, during tunnelling, the

leading edge of the pulse is less attenuated than the trailing edge, then, the time envelope

of the out–coming ﬁnal small ﬂux can be totally under the temporal initial–ﬂux envelope,

which should pass through the same position if its motion were free in vacuum (see also the

discussion in [92–94]). And, if the dependence of AT from energy is much more weak than

the dependence of the weight factor in an initial wave packet, the spectral expansion and

hence the geometrical form of the transmitted wave packet will be practically undistorted in

comparison with the spectral expansion and the form of the initial wave packet (reshaping).

But if the dependence of AT from energy is not weak, then the pulse form and width can

be noticeably changed (reconstruction).

21

The proposed scheme can be considered as a possible suﬃcient (but not necessary)

causality condition and one can try to formulate more general causality condition when the

temporal envelope of the ﬁnal ﬂux can even go out of the temporal envelope of the initial

pulse ﬂowing through the same position. Really, one can assume that the wave–packet

spectral expansion and then the shape and width of the ﬁnal pulse remain the same as for

the initial pulse (reshaping). And, if the dependence of AT from energy is not weak, then the

pulse form and width can be changed (reconstructing). For example, the following relation

T

Z

−∞

[Jin(xf , t) − Jf,+(xf , t) dt ≥ 0, −∞ < T < ∞

(47)

is quite acceptable. It does simply signify that during any semi–conﬁned (from above) time

interval, an integral ﬁnal ﬂux (along any direction) does not exceed that integral ﬂux which

should pass through the same position during the free motion (with the light velocity c for

photons) of the initial wave packet in vacuum, although, by the way, one can ﬁnd such ﬁnite

T1 and T2 , (−∞ < T1 < T2 < ∞) for which

T2

Z

T1

[Jin(xf , t) − Jf,+(xf , t)] dt < 0.

One can also propose another causality condition:

(48)

where T0 is the instant of the intersection of the temporal envelopes of both ﬂuxes after

the ﬁnal–peak appearance. Relation (48) does simply signify that there is a delay in the

averaged appearance of the forward part of the ﬁnal wave packet, in comparison with the

averaged appearance of the forward part of that wave packet, which should pass through

the same position xf , during the free motion of the initial wave packet in vacuum. The

conditions (47) and (48) are much more general than the previous one. The same relations

can be also used for the nonrelativistic causality conditions, with the only substitution of

xf by xi in Jin.

22

It is curious that, without violating such causality, a certain undistorted information,

carried out by a low–frequency modulation of a high–frequency wave packet, can be trans-

mitted (however, with a strong attenuation) with a superluminal wave–packet group (or

eﬀective) velocity when attenuated reshaping takes place.

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS

I. Now one can conclude that the basic quantum–physical formalism for determining the

collision and tunnelling times for nonrelativistic particles and for photons has been already,

at least in principle, constructed: (1) there are self–consistent deﬁnitions of mean time in-

stants and time durations of various collision processes (including tunnelling) together with

variances of their distributions, based on utilizing the properties of time as a quantum–

physical observable (in quantum mechanics and in quantum electrodynamics), just similarly

to other observables; (2) these deﬁnitions are functioning rather well, at least for asymptotic

distances between initial wave packets and interaction regions and ﬁnite distances between

ﬁnal wave packets and interaction regions.

In these cases, the phase–time, clock and in-

stanton approaches give the results which are coincident with the mean duration or the

square root of the duration–distribution variance obtained within our formalism. And, the

asymptotic mean dwell time is the weighted average sum of the corresponding tunnelling and

reﬂection durations. Moreover, such “ asymptotic” coincidence can be naturally extended,

if we take into account, also, the mean squared time duration

< [τN (xi, xf )2] >= [< τN (xi, xf ) >]2 + DτN (xi, xf )

(49)

with

DτN (xi, xf ) = Dtn(xf ) + Dt+(xi)

where index N signiﬁes T or tun or pen or R, and n = + or − . Relation (49) can be

rewritten also in the following equivalent forms:

23

< [τN (xi, xf )]2 >=< [tn(xf )− < t+(xi) >]2 > +Dt+(xi)

=< [< tn(xf ) > −t+(xi)]2 > +Dtn(xi).

(50)

And, now we see that [< τ ph

T >]2 + Dτ ph

T

, the squared hybrid time [(τ La

y,tun)2 + (τ La

z,tun)2]1/2 ,

introduced by B¨uttiker [61], and the squared absolute value of the complex tunnelling time,

in the Feynman path–integration approach, are examples of mean squared durations and,

all three are coincident in the cases of the inﬁnite spatial extension of the magnetic ﬁeld

for the B¨uttiker hybrid time and of the instanton version pf the Feynman formalism. By

the way, this formalism has been earlier applied and tested in the time analysis of nuclear

and atomic collisions for which the boundary conditions are experimentally and theoretically

assigned in the region, asymptotically distant from the interaction region, where the incident

(before collision) and ﬁnal (after collision) ﬂuxes are well separated in time , without any

superposition and interference. And, it has been supported (see in particular, [25,26] and

references therein) by the results: (i) the validity of a correspondence principle between

the time–energy QM commutation relation and the CM Poisson brackets; (ii) the validity

of an Ehrenfest principle for the average time durations; (iii) the coincidence of the quasi

classical limit of our own QM deﬁnitions for time durations (when such a limit exists; i.e., for

above–barrier energies) with analogous well-known expressions of classical mechanics; (iv)

the analysis of all other known theoretical approaches to the deﬁnition of collision durations,

on the base of our formalism; (v) the analysis of experimental data on direct and indirect

measurements of nuclear–reaction durations, at the range 10−21–10−15 sec, and, in particular,

the extraction from these data of informations on compound–nucleus level densities with the

appropriate juxtaposition of the obtained informations with data of other experiments.

Let us stress that for complete extracting the time–duration values from experimental

data on indirect measurements of nuclear–reaction durations, it is necessary to utilize not

only the expressions for mean durations but also correct deﬁnitions of the duration variances

and the higher–order central moments of the duration distribution [26] which is provided

24

by our formalism. At least, let us note that such a formalism also provided useful tools

for resolving some long– standing problems related to the time–energy uncertainty relation

[25,26].

II. For the applications of the presented formalism to such cases, when one intends to

consider, not only asymptotic distances but also the region inside and near interactions,

we have revised the notation of averaging weight (or integration measure) in time represen-

tation, utilizing two measure J±(x, t) for calculations of instant and duration mean values,

distribution variances, for particle moving, passing, transferring and the measure dP (x, t) or

P (x1, x2; t) for limited calculations of only mean durations for particle staying, or dwelling.

And, with these three measures, we can arrange all known approaches (but, of course, within

the conventional quantum mechanics), including the mean dwell time, the Larmor–clock

times and the times given by various versions of the Feynman path–integration approach,

into an unique consistent and non–contradictory scheme on the base of our formalism even

inside and near barriers.

By the way, dP (x, t) can be used as the adequate averaging measure for deﬁning mean

values and variances of position and distance distributions (see also [14]), together with

J±(x, t) as the measures for the deﬁnitions of the mean traversed distances during ﬁnite time

intervals, for constructing the basic quantum–mechanical formalism of the space analysis of

collision and propagation processes.

III. The O–R ﬂux separation scheme, within the conventional quantum mechanics (and

quantum electrodynamics), is not the only possible one,although it is the only known in-

coherent ﬂux separation without introducing any new postulates. Within the conventional

quantum theory one can also get the physically clear (but mathematically not very suit-

able) coherent wave–packet separation by positive and negative momenta, which is explicit

out of the barrier region and is obtainable by the momentum Fourier expansion inside the

barrier region. This separation can be transformed in the incoherent ﬂux separation, after

utilizing the postulate of quantum measurement theory, about a possibility to describe mea-

surement conditions by the corresponding projector, acting on wave functions, namely by

25

the projectors Λexp,± onto positive–momentum and negative–momentum states respectively.

There are also ﬂux separation schemes within nonstandard versions of quantum theory (see

examples in Sec.5). However, whatever separation scheme we choose, we have to keep to

at least two necessary conditions: (1) the probabilistic meaning of every normalized ﬂux

component and, (2) passing to the standard ﬂux expressions in the asymptotically remote

spatial region, well–known in quantum collision theory (since the boundary conditions of any

quantum collision in the asymptotic range are for long inspected and have not to depend

from a chosen version of quantum mechanics).

For the space inside and near a barrier at least four kinds of separations of wave–packet

ﬂuxes do now coexist, with the fulﬁllment of these conditions for all of them. These separa-

tions are deﬁned by diﬀerent schemes, although univocally from the mathematical point of

view: (i) the O–R separation J = J+ + J− with J± = JΘ(±J) was obtained within the con-

ventional probabilistic continuity equation (following from the time–dependent Schr¨odinger

equation) without any new physical postulate or any new mathematical approximation [53].

The asymptotic behaviour of the obtained expressions was tested by the comparison with

other approaches and with the experimental results [35]; (ii) the proposed here separation

J = Jexp,+ +Jexp,−(Jexp,± being the ﬂuxes which correspond to Λexp,±Ψ(x, t) respectively) ob-

tained also within the conventional probabilistic continuity equation, however after applying

the projector ( or wave–function reduction) postulate of quantum measurement theory. The

asymptotic behaviour of the expressions, obtained on the base of this separation, is the same

as in (i); (iii) relation (28) was obtained in the Muga–Brouard–Sala approach, according to

the physical clear incoherent ﬂux separation by positive and negative momenta, but with

additional introducing the model of the Wigner–path distribution; (iv) relation (34) was ob-

tained in the Leavens approach, according to the incoherent ﬂux separation by trajectories

of particles to be transmitted and to be reﬂected, with introducing the nonstandard Bohm

interpretation of quantum mechanics.

The ﬂux separation schemes (i), (iii), and (iv) give asymmetric expressions for the mean

dwell time near a barrier (see the relations (21), (29), and (30)–(33) respectively), apparently

26

due to the right–left asymmetry of boundary conditions: we have a partially simultaneous

coexistence of incident and reﬂected wave packets from the left and the only one transmitted

wave packet on the right. The separation (ii) gives the symmetric expression (22) for the

mean dwell time even near a barrier.

IV. From reasonings, presented in Sec.2, 6, and 8, one can easily see that positive values

(or values inside (or on) the light cone for relativistic waves) of the collision or propagation

or tunnelling duration is only a suﬃcient but not the necessary causality condition. Now, we

have not a unique general formulation of the causality principle which would be necessary

for all possible cases. In Sec.2 and Sec.8 some new formulations of the causality condition

are proposed for possible approbations.

V. The phenomenon of reshaping (reconstructing), which was spoken about in Sec.8, as

well as the advance phenomenon at the beginning of tunnelling, which was spoken about in

Se.6, are closely connected with a coherent super–position of incoming and reﬂected waves.

It is advisable to examine these phenomena from various viewpoints and within various

approaches with the scope to elucidate causality condition during tunnelling. Moreover, the

investigation of the phenomena of reshaping (reconstructing) and advance by themselves

could pursue, moreover, two important purposes: it will inevitably be the necessary part of

the future kinematic theory of the tunnelling of particles, waves, many–particle systems, and

solitons inside and near potential barriers and besides, that can serve as a base of the birth

and development of a new ﬁeld of the physical information–a superluminal propagation of

information (see also [91]).

VI. It is known that there are multiple internal reﬂections from the both potential walls

and corresponding multiple penetrations through the walls during the particle motion inside

a potential well or a potential barrier with above–barrier energies [95,96]. The sums of the

multiply reﬂected and penetrated waves give the resulted reﬂected and transmitted waves

with the ﬁnal reﬂection and transmission amplitudes. Naturally, the following question

arises: are there such multiple internal reﬂections and corresponding penetrations during

particle tunnelling with sub–barrier energies ? In [96] this question was studied and replied

27

formally positively. But a simple analysis permits to clear up that the matching conditions

give deﬁnite solutions only when inside a barrier the motion along the incident ﬂux is

described by the decreasing wave and the motion against the incident ﬂux is described by the

increasing wave. However, for such waves, the ﬂuxes are always equal to zero. For resolving

this paradox, one can try to analyze the momentum Fourier–expansions of decreasing and

increasing waves. But then intricate paradoxes with a-causality appear. This problem is

very curious and can born some surprises.

VII. As one can conclude, the O–R formalism, presented here, permits in principle to

study temporal characteristics in the Schr¨odinger and Feynman representations (which are

formally equivalent). By the way, an interesting attempt was undertaken in [97] to develop

the self–consistent method for calculating time quantities related to the motion of a particle,

utilizing the Feynman representation and comparing the proposed method with the O–R

formalism (in its earlier version presented in [35], however without the separation J =

J+ + J−).

VIII. There is one more possible formally equivalent to the Schr¨odinger and Feynman

representation for examining the collision and tunnelling evolution. As it is known, in

the quantum theory to energy E, two operators correspond– the operator i¯h∂/∂t and the

hamiltonian operator H in terms of the coordinate and momentum operators. The duality

of these operators is well seen from the Schr¨odinger equation HΨ = i¯h∂Ψ/∂t . The similar

duality takes place for time in quantum mechanics: besides the general form −i¯h∂/∂E,

which is valid for any physical system (in the continuum energy spectrum), it is possible to

express the time operator T , utilizing the commutation relation [T , H] = i¯h, in terms of

the coordinate and momentum operators too [21,26]. And, to study the collision and the

tunnelling evolution, via the operator T with the corresponding equation T Ψ = tΨ, it can

prove to be useful too, particularly for researching, the inﬂuence of the barrier form on the

tunnelling time [26].

IX. Time analysis of more complex processes, such as formations and decays of metastable

states and time correlations of ﬂuctuations of various quantities in many–particle systems

28

with the accompaniment of tunnelling processes, has to be developed on the base of the

adequate formalisms for such processes, which are not developed yet and were only marked

in [26] for simple approximations.

X. Time analysis in processes in the discrete energy spectra (for instance, for evolving

wave packets composed from bound states inside two–well potentials with a barrier between

wells) is quite diﬀerent from time analysis of processes in the continuous energy spectra. For

such processes, one can use the formalism based on the properties of the time operator in the

discrete energy spectra [26,76], and, durations of transitions, (with non–zero ﬂuxes), from

one well to another, are deﬁned by the Poincare‘ period 2π¯h/dmin, where dmin is the maximal

common divisor of the level distances. The latter is deﬁned, mainly, by the minimal level

splitting caused by the barrier and hence depends on the barrier transition (penetration)

probability at the appropriate energies.

Jackson’s paradox and its resolution by the four-dimensional
geometric quantities

In this paper it is shown that the real cause of Jackson’s paradox is the use of
three-dimensional (3D) quantities, e.g., E, B, F, L, T, their transformations
and equations with them. The principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed and
there is no paradox when the physical reality is attributed to the 4D geometric
quantities, e.g., to the 4D torque N (bivector) or, equivalently, to the 4D torques
Ns and Nt (1-vectors), which together contain the same physical information as
the bivector N .

I. INTRODUCTION

In a recent paper1 in this Journal Jackson discovered an apparent paradox;
there is a three-dimensional (3D) torque and so a time rate of change of 3D
angular momentum in one inertial frame, but no 3D angular momentum and
no 3D torque in another. Two inertial frames S (the laboratory frame) and S′
(the moving frame) are considered (they are K and K ′ respectively in Jackson’s
notation). In S′ a particle of charge q and mass m experiences only the radially
directed electric force caused by a point charge Q ﬁxed permanently at the
origin. Consequently both L′ and the torque T′ (Jackson’s N′ is denoted as
T′) are zero in S′, see Fig. 1(a) in Ref. 1. (The vectors in the 3D space will
be designated in bold-face.) In S the charge Q is in uniform motion and it
produces both an electric ﬁeld E and a magnetic ﬁeld B. The existence of B
in S is responsible for the existence of the 3D magnetic force F = qu × B and
this force provides a 3D torque T (T = x × F) on the charged particle, see Fig.
1(b) in Ref. 1. Consequently a nonvanishing angular momentum of the charged
particle changes in time in S, T = dL/dt. Jackson1 considers that there is
no paradox and that such result is relativistically correct result, i.e., that the
principle of relativity is not violated.

It is recently revealed2 that the real cause of the paradox is - the use of 3D
quantities, e.g., E, B, F, L, T, their transformations and equations with them.
In Ref. 2, instead of using 3D quantities, it is dealt from the outset with 4D
geometric quantities and equations with them. In such treatment the paradox
does not appear and the principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed.
In this
paper we shall brieﬂy repeat the consideration from Ref. 2. It is worth noting
that exactly the same paradox appears in the Trouton-Noble experiment, see,
e.g., Ref. 3 and references therein.

The calculations in Ref. 2 (also in Ref. 3) and in this paper are performed
in the geometric algebra formalism, which is recently nicely presented in this

Journal by Hestenes.4 Physical quantities will be represented by geometric 4D
quantities, multivectors, that are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., as ab-
solute quantities (AQs) or, when some basis has been introduced, they are
represented as 4D coordinate-based geometric quantities (CBGQs) comprising
both components and a basis. For simplicity and for easier understanding only
the standard basis {γµ; 0, 1, 2, 3} of orthonormal 1-vectors, with timelike vector
γ0 in the forward light cone, will be used. For all mathematical details regarding
the spacetime algebra reader can consult Hestenes’ paper.4

II. DISCUSSION OF JACKSON’S DERIVATION AND RESULTS

First a remark about the ﬁgures in Ref. 1. Both ﬁgures would need to
contain the time axes as well. Fig. 1(a) (Fig. 1(b), and Fig. 2) is the projection
onto the hypersurface t′ = const. (t = const.); the distances are simultaneously
determined in the S′ (S) frame. The Lorentz transformations (LT) cannot
transform the hypersurface t′ = const. into the hypersurface t = const. and
the distances that are simultaneously determined in the S′ frame cannot be
transformed by the LT into the distances simultaneously determined in the S
frame. Such ﬁgures could be possible for the Galilean transformations, but for
the LT they are meaningless.

In Sec. III Jackson1 discusses “Lorentz transformations of the angular mo-
mentum between frames.” He starts with the usual covariant deﬁnition of the
angular momentum tensor M µν = xµpν − xν pµ, Eq. (8) in Ref. 1. Notice
that the standard basis {γµ}, i.e., Einstein’s system of coordinates, is implicit
in that deﬁnition. In Einstein’s system of coordinates the standard, i.e., Ein-
stein’s synchronization5 of distant clocks and Cartesian space coordinates xi
In Ref. 1 the vector L is called the
are used in the chosen inertial frame.
angular momentum and its components Li are identiﬁed with the space-space
components of M µν. However, a physical interpretation is not given for an-
other vector Lt. Its components Lt,i are identiﬁed with the three time-space
components of M µν (we denote Jackson’s Ki with Lt,i, K with Lt). The same
identiﬁcation is supposed to hold both in S′, the rest frame of the charges q
t,i = M ′0i, and in S, the laboratory frame; the
and Q, L′
same relations but with unprimed quantities. This then leads to the usual trans-
formations of the components of L that are given by Eq. (11) in Ref. 1. In
contrast to Ref. 1 we write both transformations, for Li and for Lt,i; L1 = L′
1,
t,2 + βL′
L2 = γ(L′
3),
Lt,3 = γ(L′
2). The characteristic feature of these transformations is that
the components Li in S are expressed by the mixture of components L′
i and L′
t,i
from S′. This causes that the components of the 3D angular momentum do not
vanish in the laboratory frame S, even if they do in S′. In the case considered
in Ref. 1 L3 is diﬀerent from zero due to contribution from L′

i = (1/2)εiklM ′kl, L′

t,3 − βL′

t,1, Lt,2 = γ(L′

This is in a complete analogy with the usual identiﬁcation of the components
of B and E with the space-space and the time-space components respectively
i = (1/2c)εiklF ′lk,
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength tensor F µν . In S′ it is B′

2

i = F ′i0, and the same relations but with unprimed quantities hold in S,
E′
see Ref. 6 Sec. 11.9. Such procedure yields the usual transformations for the
components of B and E, see, e.g., Ref. 6 Eq. (11.148). The comparison of
the identiﬁcations shows that the components Li correspond to −Bi and Lt,i
to −Ei. In all these relations the components of the 3D vectors L, Lt and B,
E are written with lowered (generic) subscripts, since they are not the spatial
components of the 4D quantities. This refers to the third-rank antisymmetric ε
tensor too. The super- and subscripts are used only on the components of the
4D quantities.

In the same way we can determine the components Ti of the torque T
(T = dL/dt) and the components Tt,i of another torque Tt (Tt = dLt/dt) by the
identiﬁcation in both frames with the space-space and the time-space compo-
nents respectively of the torque four-tensor N µν, Ti = (1/2)εiklN kl, Tt,i = T 0i,
which gives the transformations

k and T ′

Again the transformed components Ti are expressed by the mixture of compo-
nents T ′
t,k. Hence the components of “physical” torque T do not vanish
in S, even if they do in S′. In Ref. 1 all T ′
k are zero but the component T3 in
S is 6= 0 due to contribution from T ′
t,2. Jackson,1,6 as all others, considers that
only the space-space parts, Li and Ti, i.e. the 3D vectors L and T, are physical
quantities. Actually, it is almost generally accepted that the covariant quanti-
ties, e.g., M µν , N µν, F µν , etc. are only auxiliary mathematical quantities from
which “physical” 3D quantities, L, T, E and B, etc., are deduced.

Several objections are raised in Refs. 2, 7-9 to such derivation of the usual
transformations for the components of L and Lt, B and E and T and Tt. Some
of them are quoted here.

(i) M µν , F µν and N µν are only components (numbers) that are (implicitly)
determined in the standard basis {γµ}, i.e., in Einstein’s system of coordinates.
In another system of coordinates that is diﬀerent than the Einstein system of co-
ordinates, e.g., diﬀering in the chosen synchronization, all above identiﬁcations
are impossible and meaningless.

(ii) The above identiﬁcations and transformations refer only to components.
The 3D vectors, e.g., T′ and T′
t in S′, and T and Tt in S, which are geometric
quantities in the 3D space, are constructed multiplying six independent com-
ponents of N ′µν and N µν by the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′ in S′ and i, j, k
in S. The components, e.g., Ti in S are determined by the usual transforma-
tions (1) from the components T ′
t,i in S′, but there is no transformation
which transforms i′, j′, k′ from S′ into i, j, k in S. Hence it is not true that
T = T1i + T2j + T3k is obtained by the LT from T′=T ′
3k′. Con-
sequently T and T′ are not the same quantity for relatively moving inertial
observers in S and S′, T 6= T
. The transformations that do not refer to the
same 4D quantity are not the LT, but we call them the “apparent” transforma-
tions (AT). According to that the transformations (1) and those for L, Eq. (11)

i and T ′

2j′ + T ′

1i′ + T ′

′

3

in Ref. 1, are not the LT, but they are the AT of the 3D T and L. In Ref. 7-9
it is explained in detail that the usual transformations of B and E, Ref. 6 Eqs.
(11.148) and (11.149), are also the AT and not the LT (a fundamental achieve-
ment). In fact, as shown in Ref. 2, all transformations of the 3D vectors p, F,
E, B, L, T, etc. are the AT and not the LT. This also means that equations
with them, like Eq. (4) (dp/dt = F = qE + qu × B) and Eq. (5) (dL/dt = T)
in Ref. 1, are not relativistically correct equations. Thus, the fact that in Ref.
1 the same result, T′ = 0 but T 6= 0, is obtained by two diﬀerent methods of
calculation does not mean that the calculations are relativistically correct and
that the principle of relativity is satisﬁed.

III. DEFINITIONS OF 4D QUANTITIES

The relativistically correct treatment of the problem considered in Ref. 1
and the resolution of Jakson’s paradox are given in Ref. 2, Secs. 4-4.3, using
4D torques N , Ns and Nt. Here we shall only brieﬂy expose the consideration
from Secs. 2, 4, 4.1 and 4.3, Ref. 2.

As shown in Ref. 10 the electromagnetic ﬁeld F (bivector) is the primary
quantity for the whole electromagnetism. F (x) for a charge Q moving with
constant velocity uQ (1-vector) is

3
F (x) = kQ(x ∧ (uQ/c))/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|

,

(2)

where k = 1/4πε0. For the charge Q at rest, uQ/c = γ0.
Instead of the
usual identiﬁcation of Ei and Bi with components of F µν we construct, in
a mathematically correct way, the 4D geometric quantities that represent the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds by a decomposition of F . It can be decomposed into
1-vectors of the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld B and a unit time-like
1-vector v/c as

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v,
E = (1/c)F · v, B = −(1/c2)I(F ∧ v),

see Ref. 8. In (3) I is the unit pseudoscalar. (I is deﬁned algebraically without
introducing any reference frame, as in Ref. 11, Sec. 1.2.) v is the velocity
(1-vector) of a family of observers who measures E and B ﬁelds. Since F is
antisymmetric it holds that E · v = B · v = 0, which yields that only three com-
ponents of E and three components of B are independent quantities. Observe
that E and B depend not only on F but on v as well.

From (3) and the known F , Eq. (2), we ﬁnd the 1-vectors E and B for a

charge Q moving with constant velocity uQ

(4)

E = (D/c
B = (−D/c3)I(x ∧ uQ ∧ v),

3
. Note that B in (4) can be expressed in terms of
where D = kQ/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|
E as B = (1/c3)I(uQ ∧ E ∧ v). When the world lines of the observer and the
charge Q coincide, uQ = v, then (4) yields that B = 0 and only an electric ﬁeld
(Coulomb ﬁeld) remains. E and B from (4) are AQs; they are independent of
the chosen reference frame and the chosen system of coordinates in it. They
naturally generalize the expressions for the 3D E and B, Eqs. (3a) and (3b) in
Ref. 1, to the 4D spacetime.

Furthermore, instead of the covariant form of the Lorentz force, Eq. (A2) in
Ref. 1 (only components in the implicit {γµ} basis), we deal with the Lorentz
force as an AQ, KL = (q/c)F ·u. Using the decomposition of F into E and B, Eq.
(3), this Lorentz force can be written as KL = (q/c) [(1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v] · u,
where u is the velocity (1-vector) of a charge q. Particularly, from the deﬁnition
of the Lorentz force KL = (q/c)F · u and the relation E = (1/c)F · v it follows
that the Lorentz force ascribed by an observer comoving with a charge, u = v,
is purely electric KL = qE. Hence our equation of motion of a charge q is
mdu/dτ = KL = (q/c) [(1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v] · u, which replaces Eq. (4) from
Ref. 1. In that equation τ is the proper time, u is the velocity 1-vector of a
particle that is deﬁned to be the tangent to its world line.

The 4D AQs, the angular momentum M and the torque N (bivectors) for
the Lorentz force KL and manifestly Lorentz invariant equation connecting M
and N are deﬁned as

M = x ∧ p, N = x ∧ KL; N = dM/dτ,

(5)

where x is the position 1-vector and p is the proper momentum (1-vector) p =
mu.

L − xν K µ

When M and N are written as CBGQs in the {γµ} basis they become
M = (1/2)M µνγµ ∧ γν, with M µν = xµpν − xν pµ, and N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν,
with N µν = xµK ν
L. The components, e.g., N µν , are determined as
N µν = γν ·(γµ·N ) = (γν ∧γµ)·N . We see that the components M µν are identical
to the covariant angular momentum four-tensor given by Eq. (A3) in Ref. 1.
However M and N from (5) are 4D geometric quantities, the 4D AQs, whereas
the components M µν and N µν that are used in the usual covariant approach,
e.g., Eq. (A3) in Ref. 1, are coordinate quantities, the numbers obtained in the
speciﬁc system of coordinates, i.e., in the {γµ} basis. In contrast to the usual
covariant approach, M and N as 4D CBGQs are also 4D geometric quantities,
which contain both components and a basis, here bivector basis γµ ∧ γν . The
essential diﬀerence between our geometric approach and the usual covariant
picture is the presence of the basis. The existence of a basis causes that every
4D CBGQ is invariant under the passive LT ; the components transform by the
LT and the basis by the inverse LT leaving the whole 4D CBGQ unchanged.
This means that a CBGQ represents the same physical quantity for relatively
moving 4D observers. Hence it holds that, e.g.,

N = (1/2)N

µ ∧ γ

ν = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν ,

(6)

where all primed quantities are the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones.
When physical laws are written with such Lorentz invariant quantities, 4D AQs

5

or 4D CBGQs, then they automatically satisfy the principle of relativity. In the
standard approach to special relativity5 the principle of relativity is postulated
outside the framework of a mathematical formulation of the theory. There,5 it
is also considered that the principle of relativity holds for the equations written
with the 3D quantities.

Here, as in Ref. 2, we introduce new 4D torques as AQs, 1-vectors Ns and
Nt. The same decomposition can be made for N as for F , (3). It is decomposed
into two 1-vectors, the “space-space” torque Ns and the “time-space” torque
Nt, and the unit time-like 1-vector v/c as

N = (v/c) · (INs) + (v/c) ∧ Nt
Ns = I(N ∧ v/c), Nt = (v/c) · N ; Ns · v = Nt · v = 0.

(7)

Only three components of Ns and three components of Nt are independent
since N is antisymmetric. Here again v is the velocity (1-vector) of a family
of observers who measures Ns and Nt. Again, as for E and B, the torques Ns
and Nt depend not only on the bivector N but on v as well. The relations (7)
show that Ns and Nt taken together contain the same physical information as
the bivector N .

s = N 0
s = N 23 = x2K 3

When Ns and Nt are written as CBGQs in the {γµ} basis they are Ns =
s γµ = (1/2c)εαβµνNαβvµγν, Nt = (1/c)N µνvµγν. In the frame of “ﬁducial”
N µ
observers (it will be called the γ0-frame), in which the observers who measure
1-vectors E, B, KL, Ns and Nt are at rest, the velocity v is v = cγ0. In that
frame and in the {γµ} basis vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0). Let us now take that the S frame
is the γ0-frame. Then in S, N 0
t = 0, and only the spatial components
s = N 31 and
s components are N 1
remain. N i
N 3
s = N 12. Comparison with the identiﬁcation Ti = (1/2)εiklN kl shows that
in the γ0-frame the components of the 1-vector Ns correspond to components
of “physical” 3D torque T, Ti = N i
t . Hence only for
“ﬁducial” observers one can deal with components of two 3D torques T and Tt;
all six components are equally well physical. However, even in that frame the
relativistically correct geometric quantities are not 3D vectors T and Tt, but
1-vectors Ns and Nt. The whole discussion with the torque can be completely
repeated for the angular momentum replacing N , Ns and Nt by M , Ms and Mt.
In the γ0-frame components of 1-vectors Ms and Mt correspond to components
of L and Lt respectively in the usual 3D picture.

Of course, it holds that, e.g., Ns as a CBGQ is a Lorentz invariant quan-
tity, Ns = N µ

transforms of the unprimed ones. The components of Ns (Nt, Ms, Mt, E, B,

Furthermore we write N from (5) using the expression for KL and Eq. (2)

for F ,

N = (Dq/c2)(u · x)(uQ ∧ x).

Ns and Nt are then determined from (7) and (9)

Ns = (Dq/c3)(u · x)I(x ∧ v ∧ uQ),
Nt = (Dq/c3)(u · x)[(x ∧ uQ) · v].

Comparison with (4) shows that Ns and Nt can be expressed in terms of B and
E as

Ns = q(u · x)B,
Nt = (q/c)(u · x)E.

As already said, in connection with (4), when uQ = v then B = 0 and Ns = 0
as well.

IV. RESOLUTION OF JACKSON’S PARADOX USING

4D TORQUES

The knowledge of N as an AQ, Eq. (9), enables us to ﬁnd the expressions for
N as CBGQs in S′ and S. First let us write all AQs from (9) as CBGQs in S′, the
rest frame of the charge Q, in which uQ = cγ′
0 ∧ x),
and in the {γ′
µ} basis it is explicitly given as

0. Then N = (Dq/c)(u · x)(γ′

The components x′µ are x′µ = (x′0 = ct′, x′1, x′2, 0) where x′1 = r′ cos θ′,
µ, where u′µ = dx′µ/dτ = (u′0, u′1, u′2, 0). The
x′2 = r′ sin θ′. In S′, u = u′µγ′
components N

µν that are diﬀerent from zero are only N ′01 and N ′02.

′

In order to ﬁnd the torque N in S we now write all AQs from (9) as CBGQs
in S and in the {γµ} basis. In S the charge Q is moving with velocity uQ =
γQcγ0 + γQβQcγ1, where βQ = |uQ| /c and γQ = (1 − β2

Q)−1/2. Then N is

N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν = N 01γ0 ∧ γ1 + N 02γ0 ∧ γ2 + N 12γ1 ∧ γ2,

(13)

or explicitly it becomes

N = (Dq/c)(uµxµ)[γQ(x1 − βQx0)(γ0 ∧ γ1)
2
(γ0 ∧ γ2) + βQγQx

(γ1 ∧ γ2)].

+γQx

(14)

Now the components N µν that are diﬀerent from zero are not only the time-
space components N 01 and N 02 but also the space-space component N 12 =
βQN 02.

7

We note that another way to ﬁnd N as CBGQ in S, (14), is to make the LT
of N as CBGQ in S′, (12). Of course, according to (6), both CBGQs are equal,
N ((12)) = N ((14)); they represent the same 4D quantity N from (9) in S′
and S frames. The principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed and there is not
any paradox.

Instead of the torque N we can use Ns and Nt. However, as already said,
Ns and Nt are not uniquely determined by N , but their explicit values depend
also on v. This means that it is important to know which frame is chosen to be
the γ0-frame. Observe that the same conclusions also refer to the determination
of E, B and Ms, Mt from F and M respectively. In this paper we shall only
consider the case when S is the γ0-frame. For another case readers can consult
Sec. 4.2 in Ref. 2. Ns and Nt will be determined directly from (10) taking into
account that v = cγ0 and uQ = γQcγ0 + γQβQcγ1. This yields that

Ns = N µ

s γµ = N 12γ3, Nt = N 1

(15)
where N 12, N 01 and N 02 are from (14). Thus when S is the γ0-frame the
“space-space” torque Ns is diﬀerent from zero.

t γ2 = N 01γ1 + N 02γ2,

t γ1 + N 2

The same Ns and Nt can be determined using (11) and (4). The charge Q
moves in S, which yields that both E and the magnetic ﬁeld B are diﬀerent
from zero. Then E = Eµγµ, E0 = E3 = 0, E1 = DγQ(x1 − βQx0), E2 =
DγQx2, and the magnetic ﬁeld is B = Bµγµ, B0 = B1 = B2 = 0, B3 =
(D/c)γQβQx2 = βQE2/c. The spatial components Ei and Bi are the same as
the usual expressions for the components of E and B for an uniformly moving
charge. Inserting these equations into (11) we again ﬁnd Ns and Nt as in (15).
Ns is 6= 0 since B is 6= 0.

Ns from (15) can be written in the form similar to Eq. (7) from Ref. 1,

when the above explicit form of E and B are used. Thus
Ns = N 3γ3 = N 12γ3 = (βQctK 2

L + (q/c)βQy(Eµuµ)γ3.

(16)

In the usual approach, e.g., Ref. 1, it is considered that in the S frame the
whole physical torque is the 3D T, i.e., Tz, given by Eq. (7) in Ref. 1. We see
that in the 4D spacetime the physical torque, theoretically and experimentally,
is either the bivector N , (14) or (12), or two 1-vectors Ns and Nt given by
(15) and (16). Only when the laboratory frame S is the γ0-frame the spatial
components of Ns can be put into the correspondence with the components of
the 3D T. However note that in (16) all components are the components of the
4D quantities, 1-vectors x, u, KL, E and B, while in Eq. (7) in Ref. 1 only the
corresponding 3D vectors are involved.

Let us now determine Ns and Nt as CBGQs in S′. Relative to the S′ frame
the charge Q is at rest uQ = cγ′
0, but the “ﬁducial” observers are moving with
velocity v = γQcγ′
1. Then Ns and Nt in S′ can be obtained either
directly from (10) or by means of the LT (8) of Ns and Nt from (15). We ﬁnd
Ns and Nt as

where N ′01, N ′02 are given in (12). Now Ns is diﬀerent from zero not only in
S but in the S′ frame as well. The same results for Ns and Nt in S′ can be
obtained using (11) and (4) and writing all AQs as CBGQs in the S′ frame.

It can be easily seen that Ns (Nt) from (15) is equal to Ns (Nt) from (17);
it is the same 4D CBGQ for observers in S and S′; the principle of relativity is
naturally satisﬁed and there is no paradox.

Inserting Ns and Nt from (15) and (17) into Eq. (7), which connects N with
Ns and Nt, we ﬁnd that the expressions for N in S and S′ are the same, as it
must be.

If we would take that S′ is the γ0-frame, as in Sec. 4.2 in Ref. 2, then
the explicit expressions for Ns and Nt as CBGQs would be diﬀerent than those
given in (15) and (17). For example, in that case Ns is zero but Nt 6= 0 both in
S′ and S. However when these new expressions for Ns and Nt as CBGQs are
inserted into (7) they will give the same N as when S is the γ0-frame.

V. CONCLUSIONS

s = N 0

s and Tt,i = N i

It is proved in this paper, as in Ref. 2, that the physical torques are the
4D geometric quantities, the bivector N deﬁned in (5) and (9), or the 1-vectors
Ns and Nt that are derived from N according to (7). They together contain
In the considered case Ns
the same physical information as the bivector N .
and Nt are deﬁned in (10). Only in the γ0-frame one can deal with components
Ti and Tt,i of two 3D torques T and Tt respectively. In that frame temporal
components of Ns and Nt as CBGQs are zero, N 0
t = 0, and the spatial
components are Ti = N i
t . All components Ti and Tt,i are equally
well physical for “ﬁducial” observers. Hence, it is not true, as generally accepted,
that only the 3D torque T is a well-deﬁned physical quantity. However, it
is shown here, and in Ref. 2, that even in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers
the relativistically correct geometric quantities are not 3D vectors T and Tt,
but the bivector N or 1-vectors Ns and Nt. These 4D geometric quantities
correctly transform under the LT, e.g., the whole torque Ns remains unchanged
under the passive LT, Ns = N µ
µ, where the components transform
by means of the LT (8) and the basis 1-vectors γµ by the inverse LT. This
means that the principle of relativity is satisﬁed and the paradox with the
torque does not appear. In contrast to it the components Ti and Tt,i transform
according to the AT (1), which diﬀer from the LT for components of 1-vectors,
e.g., (8). Furthermore, the objections (i) and (ii) from Sec. II show that the
transformations of T and Tt, as geometric quantities in the 3D space, are not
the LT but the relativistically incorrect AT.

s γµ = N ′µ

s γ′

The validity of the above relations with 4D geometric quantities can be
experimentally checked measuring all six independent components of N , or Ns
and Nt taken together, in both relatively moving frames. Only such complete
data are physically relevant in the 4D spacetime. Remember that the usual
3D torque T is connected only with three spatial components of Ns in the
frame of “ﬁducial” observers. These three components are not enough for the

determination of the relativistically correct 4D torques N , or Ns and Nt. This
is the real cause of Jackson’s paradox.

THE VARIANT PRINCIPLE

Institute for Nuclear Science and Technique,

Abstract

Based on the principle of causality, I advance a new principle of variation
and try to use it as the most general principle for research into laws of nature.

1 INTRODUCTION

Abstractly, the Nature can be examined as a system of states and actions. State is a
general concept that deﬁnes existence, structure, organization, and conservation of all
matter’s systems, and that stipulates properties, inner relationships of all things and
phenomena. Action is a operation that manifests self-inﬂuence and inter-inﬂuence of
states, that presents dynamic power and impulsion of motion and development. Generally,
state is object on which actions do. Each state has its action. Self-action makes state
conservable and developable. Action of one state on other forms interaction between
them. Self-action and inter-action cause variation of state from one to other. That
variation establishes a general law of motion.

Following this way I advance a new principle – that is called Variant Principle. Uti-
lizing this principle as the most general principle I hope that it is useful for research on
a logically systematic method to review known laws and to predict unknown laws. And
I believe that some of the readers of this article will ﬁnd out that this principle explains
naturally inner origin of variation, rules evolutionary processes of things, and perhaps
they will be the ones to complete the quest for theories of the Universe.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, I advance the ideas and concepts for
leading the equation of motion. That is just the foundation of the variant principle. A
phenomenon in physics is illustrated by this principle in Section 3. Conclusion is given in
Section 4.

2 THE EQUATION OF MOTION

In the Nature, any state and its action are constituent elements of a subject that I call it
actor,

where A is state, and

A is its action operator.
b

A = (A &

A),
b

1. For any system in which there is only one actor {A}, that actor is in self-action.
This fact causes actor either to be conserved or to be varied by action of itself
with respect to all its possible inner degrees of freedom. Conservation makes actor
invariant. But variation obeys a equation of motion,

AA = 0,
b

where action operator
A may include diﬀerentiation, integration, and/or other for-
b
mal operations doing with respect to some degrees of freedom (such as space, time,
and/or some variable), depending on actually physical problems, and A may nat-
urally be a state function describing some considered object. The value ‘0’ on the
right hand side of Eq. (II) means that variation of actor approaches to stability –
invariance, i.e. self-action is equal to zero when variation ﬁnishes.

Solution of the equation of motion describes variant process of actor. Actor varies
and ﬁnally closes to a new actor, that is solution of the equation of motion when
variation ﬁnishes.

2. For any system consisting of many actor s {A1; A2; ...}, each actor is in its self-action
and actions from others. This fact causes each actor to be varied by actions of itself
and others with respect to all its possible inner and outer degrees of freedom. This
variation obeys a equation of motion,

(

A1;
b

A2; ...)(A1; A2; ...) = 0,
b

(III)

Ai of actor Ai are operations doing with respect to some de-
where action operators
b
grees of freedom, and states Ai of actor Ai are functions characterized by considered
objects. The value ‘0’ on the right hand side of Eq. (III) means that actions are
equal to zero when variations of actor s ﬁnishes, i.e. variations of actor s approaches
to stability – invariance. In fact, Eq. (III) is an advanced form of Eq. (II).

Solutions of the equations of motion of actor s describe their variant processes. All
Actor s vary and ﬁnally close to a new actor A, that is solution of the equations of
motion when variations of actor s ﬁnishes:

A = [A1, A2, ...],

(IV)

where actor s are in the same dimension of interaction.

The Variant Principle – N. T. Anh

* For a system consisting of many actor s {A1; A2; ...}, the whole system can be

considered as a total actor which includes component actor s,

{A} = {A1; A2; ...}.

Thereby, actor A is in self-action, and it either self-conserves or self-varies
with respect to all its possible inner degrees of freedom. And variation obeys
a equation of motion (II).

3

(V)

Hence, the variant principle is stated as follows:

- In the Nature every actor varied by actions of itself and others with respect to all
possible degrees of freedom to come to some new actor is solution of the equation of
motion that describes its variant process.

Indeed, every variation is caused by action of actor onto state, variation is to escape
from action, or in other words, state varies to be agreeable to action. This fact means that
under actions actor must vary anyway with respect to all possible degrees of freedom –
transportation facilities to come to new actor, and that its speed of variation is dependent
on power of action, which is manifested by conservation of actor.

Eigenvalue of action is expressed as instrument to promote variation, as easiness of
variation. Its value over some degree of freedom shows probability of variation following
this direction.

Any actor which is done by some action must vary somehow over all possible degrees
of freedom to come to new actor which is no longer to be done by any action. That
process shows continuous variation of actor from the beginning to closing.

Therefore, this reality proves that variation is imperative to have its cause, to have its

agent, and that property of variation obeys the equation of motion.

Thereby, from Eqs. (II) and (III), equation of motion can be built for any physical
law. Using these equations (II) and (III) for research into physics is considered in the
next section. I hope that the readers will understand more profoundly about the variant
principle.

3 The Rule of Universe’s Evolution

The simplest form of self-action is expansion of actor about some degree of freedom,

eδx

∂xf (x) = f (x + δx).
b

(1)

Here is just the equation of motion for any quantity f (x), with x degree of freedom,

and δx inﬁnitesimal of x.

The Variant Principle – N. T. Anh

Universe’s evolution is described as a law of causality [2] essentially based on just this
expansion. The form of Eq. (1) is nothing but Taylor’s series. Derivatives of f (x) with
respect to x is just variations of f (x) over the degree of freedom x.

Eq. (1) has an important application in modelling the multiplication and the combi-

nation of quanta.

Call α, β, γ, ... quanta. For each quantum there is a rule of multiplication as follows

αn → e∂ααn =

i αn−i = (α + 1)n
C n

(2)

n

X
i=0

where n is order of combination, δα = 1, and C n
i

is binary coeﬃcient.

Using Eq. (2) I consider two stages in the process of the Universe’s evolution: doublet

and triplet.

For two interactive quanta the rule of multiplication reads

αn, βn →

(eβ∂ααn + eα∂β βn) =

i αn−iβi = (α + β)n.
C n

(3)

i=0

And similar to three interactive quanta

αn, βn, γn →

(e(β+γ)∂ααn + e(γ+α)∂β βn + e(α+β)∂γ γn) =

And so fourth. Eqs. (3) and (4) can be drawn as schemata.

It is easily to identify that the above schemata have the forms similar to the SU(2)
and the SU(3) groups. This means that for n quanta there is a corresponding schema
according to the SU(n) group, and the multiplication and the combination of the Universe
conform to the SU group. This rule is studied further in Ref. [3].

4 CONCLUSION

The theory of causality [1] is very useful to understand about the cause of variation. The
coexistence of two diﬀerent actors causes a contradiction. The solution to contradiction
makes contradiction varied. That variation is just one of each actor inclining to come to
a new actor. It means the diﬀerence and the contradiction of two actors have inclining
towards zero. Indeed, every system comes to equilibrium, stability. A some state which
has any immanent contradiction must vary to reach a new one having no contradiction.

The variant principle deals with the law of variation of actors, describes only actors
with their actions and states, not to mention the diﬀerence and even the contradiction in
them. In insight the variant principle is more elementary and easier to understand than
the causal principle since everything is referred as actor existing in nature. Self-action and
inter-action of actors onto their states cause the world to be in motion and in variation.

Although the variant principle gives a powerful fundamental for application to research
into laws of nature, there is no rule arisen yet for formulizing self-action and inter-action
operators. However, there are some ways to enter operators in the equation of motion
that I hope that in some next article this ways will be synthesized to a standard rule.

For instance, in the quantum electromagnetic dynamics the equations of motion of the

electron-positron and the electromagnetic ﬁeld are:

iγµ∂µψ(x) +

mec
~ ψ(x) +

e
~ γµAµ(x)ψ(x) = 0,
(cid:3)Aµ + ieψ(x)γµψ(x) = 0.

The ﬁrst line is the equation of motion of electron, the ﬁrst term corresponds to the
variation of electron with respect to space-time, the second gives conservation of electron,
and the third is action of the electromagnetic ﬁeld onto electron. The second line can be
rewritten as

∂ν Fνµ − Jµ = 0,

that is nothing but the Maxwell equation, with Fνµ = ∂νAµ − ∂µAν the electromag-
netic ﬁeld tenser, Aµ the 4-dimensional potential, Jµ = −ieψ(x)γµψ(x) the 4-dimensional

current density, the ﬁrst term corresponds to the variation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,
the second is the external current density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, (here the mass of
photon is zero, so the mass term is not present).

This example is easy to show that:

– The variation done over some degree of freedom is expressed as derivation with

respect to that degree of freedom.

– The conservation of actor is written as a term of actor multiplied by a constant

characterized by its conservation.

– The inﬂuence of other actor on a actor is represented as a multiplication of two

actors.

– The external actor stands equally with its variation, when an external inﬂuence does

on an actor as an external current, an external source, or an external force.

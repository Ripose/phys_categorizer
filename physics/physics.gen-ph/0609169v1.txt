Abstract

where r is the absolute refractory period.

Speech perception, in particular perception of higher frequencies than the inverse of the abso-

lute refractory period of the auditory neurons, has been a long-standing problem. We present a

novel approach by considering the correlated effect of such signals on groups of neurons, rather

than considering the spike activity resulting from a single auditory neuron.

Suppose several neurons whose refractory phases are all different, are confronted with a mono-

frequency signal, whose pitch would require an effective absolute refractory period of r/n, where

r is the absolute refractory period of a stand-alone neuron, and n is the number of such neurons.

It is not totally unreasonable to ask whether, possibly by the coherent stimulation of neurons, a

collective pattern of neural activity forms which would properly contain the frequency information

otherwise unattainable by single auditory neurons.

We indeed ﬁnd that such an effect exist.

It is based on the assumption that these neurons

either have a different offset of the refractory period, or have different absolute refractory periods

(within a certain frequency range) altogether. In such a case, different neurons are stimulated

by successive peaks. The sum over the neural activity of this group of neurons then properly

represents information about the high-pitch signal, although its frequency is too high to be resolved

by a single stand-alone neuron alone.

We demonstrate this effect by an elementary model of n = 3 neurons, all having the same

absolute refractory period r, which are equidistributed over n periods of length r/n, starting from
time t = 0. That is, these three neurons can effectively be successively stimulated at times 0, r
3 , 2r
3 ,
and then over again with a total offset of the absolute refractory period r of each single one of
these ﬁve neurons; i.e., at times r, r + r

3 , and so on.
For such a conﬁguration, each one of the neurons can take up a signal for the successive wave

3, r + 2r

trains at a frequency 3

r . Fig. 2 depicts the temporal evolution of this system of neurons, stimulated

by successive wave peaks.

The price to be paid for this “optimal” resolution of a mono-frequency signal is the narrow

(indeed, of width zero) bandwidth which is resolved by the ﬁve neurons. This can be circumvented

by considering a stochastic distribution of the offset phases. Stochastic offsets will be discussed

below in greater detail.

Another issue is the attenuation of the signal by an effective factor of n with respect to the

single, stand-alone neuron activation in the case of signals with frequencies so low that they can

be resolved within the absolute refractory period. This attenuation should be compensated by

either the plasticity of the auditory perception system, or by the integration of more neurons which

effectively contribute to the overall signal.

In what follows we present detailed numerical studies of multi-neuron systems with a stochastic

distribution of absolute refractory periods within an interval (cid:2)r − D
2 (cid:3) and initial offsets of the
order of r. The driving signal is modelled by a regular spiking activity of Frequency w = k/r. In

2 , r + D

the k > 1 regime, coherent stimulation can be expected to contribute to high pitch perception. As

for the regular case described above, the mechanism can be expected to work for k ≤ n.

Fig. 2 depicts a numerical simulation of the intensity of the spiking activity as a result of 11

nerves driven by a signal corresponding to 17 times the inverse mean absolute refractory period.
Fig. 3 depicts a numerical simulation rendering the relative error ratio e of missed signal spikes to
the absolute number of signal spikes as a function of frequency w

for a number of asynchronous

neurons ranging from a single neuron (n = 1) to 30 neurons. The numerical studies indicate a

reliable performance of coherent stimulation for frequencies corresponding to lower than to equal

to the number of participating neurons.

Entanglement of neutrino states

Abstract

End products of the decay of pion and the subsequent decay of muon form the
entangled spin state. Muon arises with the right helicity and decays with the left
helicity. This causes the conﬂict under detection of the entangled particles that
results in non-detection of neutrinos. The eﬀect considered may explain the dis-
crepancy between the experimental data and calculations in the Super-Kamiokande
experiment.

According to the quantum mechanics [1] the particles outgoing some reaction form
entangled state. The total angular momentum of the particles outgoing the reaction
maintains preserved. By detecting one of the particles in a certain spin state an ex-
perimenter triggers the spin states of the other particles to preserve the total angular
momentum. This is a core of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment conﬁrmed
experimentally by Aspect [2].

Consider decay of the charge pion [3]

π− → µ− + ¯νµ.

(1)

Muon in turn decays as

µ− → e− + ¯νeνµ.
(2)
All the end products of the decay of pion and the subsequent decay of muon, ¯νµ, e−, ¯νe,
νµ, form the entangled spin state. Since pion has the null spin then the total spin of the
entangled particles is equal to zero. Detection of one of the entangled particles in a certain
spin state destroys the entangled state with triggering the spin state of the other particles.
By deﬁnition neutrino has the left helicity while antineutrino has the right helicity. Then
muon arising in the decay of pion has the right helicity. On the contrary decaying muon
has the left helicity because the weak interaction prefers left-hand particles.

Either of the four particles involved in the entangled state may be detected ﬁrst.
Consider four possible cases. First, detection of ¯νµ that triggers the right helicity of
electron. This is not consistent with the detection of ¯νe, νµ which requires the left helicity
of electron. Second, detection of e− with the left helicity. This is consistent with the
detection of ¯νe, νµ and is not consistent with the detection of ¯νµ which requires the
right helicity of electron. Third, detection of ¯νe that triggers the left helicity of electron.
This is consistent with the detection of νµ and is not consistent with the detection of
¯νµ. Forth, detection of νµ that triggers the left helicity of electron. This is consistent
with the detection of ¯νe and is not consistent with the detection of ¯νµ. Thus due to the
entanglement of neutrino states detection of ¯νµ is not consistent with the detection of ¯νe,
νµ that results in non-detection of neutrinos. Due to the entanglement of neutrino states
one can detect 1/4 of ¯νµ and 3/4 of ¯νe, νµ.

The Super-Kamiokande experiment [4] detected atmospheric electron and muon neu-
trinos and their antineutrinos which are produced in the hadronic showers induced by

primary cosmic rays in the earth’s atmosphere. The production of atmospheric neutrinos
occurs in the decays of charge pions (K-mesons). The ratio for the atmospheric muon
and electron neutrino ﬂuxes is given by R ≡ [(νµ + ¯νµ)/(νe + ¯νe]. The calculated ratio is
R(calc) = 2. Taking account of the entanglement of neutrino states one can expect the
ratio R(calc + ent) = 4/3 and hence the double ratio R(calc + ent)/R(calc) = 2/3.

The data of the Super-Kamiokande experiment [4] yields the double ratio for contained

events depending on the energies of neutrinos

R(data/calc) = 0.652 ± 0.019 (stat.) ± 0.051 (syst.) E < 1.33 GeV
R(data/calc) = 0.668 ± 0.034 (stat.) ± 0.079 (syst.) E > 1.33 GeV

The discrepancy between the experimental data and calculations is the same as that
between the calculations with entanglement and calculations without entanglement.

Thus the results of the Super-Kamiokande experiment may be considered as a support
for the entanglement of neutrino states in the decay of pion and the subsequent decay
of muon. Now the discrepancy between the experimental data and calculations in the
Super-Kamiokande experiment are explained with neutrino oscillations, e.g. [5]. Non-
detection of neutrinos due to the entanglement of neutrino states is alternative to the
eﬀect of neutrino oscillations in explanation of the discrepancy between the experimental
data and calculations in the Super-Kamiokande experiment.

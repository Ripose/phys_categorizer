In this paper it will be exactly proved both in the geometric algebra and tensor formalisms that the usual Maxwell
equations with the three-dimensional (3D) vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B respectively, are
not, contrary to the general opinion, Lorentz covariant equations. Consequently they are not equivalent to the ﬁeld
equations with the observer independent quantities, the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F ab (tensor formalism) or with the
bivector ﬁeld F (the geometric algebra formalism). Diﬀerent 4D algebric objects are used to represent the standard
observer dependent and the new observer independent electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The proof of a fundamental
disagreement between the standard electromagnetism and the special relativity does not depend on the character
of the 4D algebric objects used to represent the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations
are presented with 1-vectors E and B, bivectors EHL and BHL and the abstract tensors, the 4-vectors Ea and Ba.
All these quantities are deﬁned without reference frames. Such ﬁeld equations are in a complete agreement with
experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently an exact proof is presented that the standard transformations (ST) [1,2] (see also the standard textbooks,
[3,4]) of the three-dimensional (3D) vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B respectively, are not
e.g.
relativistically correct. This proof is given both in the tensor formalism [5] and the geometric (Cliﬀord) algebra
formalism [6]. It is shown in both formalisms that these ST of E and B drastically diﬀer from the correct Lorentz
transformations (LT) of the corresponding 4D algebric objects representing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The
fundamental diﬀerence is that in the ST, e.g., the components of the transformed 3D E′ are expressed by the mixture
of components of the 3D E and B, and similarly for B′. However, the correct LT always transform, e.g., the electric
ﬁeld (i.e., the 4D algebric object representing the electric ﬁeld) only to the electric ﬁeld, and similarly for the magnetic
ﬁeld. The mentioned proof from [5,6] implies that the usual Maxwell equations (ME) with the 3D E and B are not
Lorentz covariant equations. Consequently they are not equivalent to the ﬁeld equations with the electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor F ab (tensor formalism) or to those with the bivector ﬁeld F (the geometric algebra formalism). In this
paper the above statement will be exactly proved both in the geometric algebra and tensor formalisms. Diﬀerent 4D
algebric objects are used to represent the standard observer dependent and the new observer independent electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. First the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are represented by the observer dependent 1-vectors Ef
and Bf deﬁned in the γ0 - frame. The usual ME in the component form are derived in section II.A. and their LT
are considered in section II.B. It is explicitly shown in II.B., using the correct LT of Ef and Bf , that the Lorentz
transformed ME are not of the same form as the original ones. This proves that, contrary to the general opinion,
the usual ME are not Lorentz covariant equations. In section II.C. the ST of the usual ME are considered taking
into account the ST of the components of the 3D E and B. It is proved that both the ST of the usual ME and the
ST of the 3D E and B have nothing in common with the correct LT. The new Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations are
constructed in section II.D. in which the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are represented by the observer independent, i.e.,
deﬁned without reference frames, 1-vectors E and B. In sections III. to III.D. the whole consideration is repeated but
dealing with the observer dependent bivectors EH and BH deﬁned in the γ0 - frame and the observer independent
bivectors EHL and BHL. In the geometric algebra formalism the active LT are used. Comparing the derivations in
sections II. to II.D. and sections III. to III.D. one concludes that the formulation with 1-vectors is simpler than the
approach with bivectors and also it is much closer to the classical formulation of the electromagnetism with the 3D
vectors E and B. In sections IV. to IV.D. the proof is presented in the tensor formalism using the observer dependent
f deﬁned in the γ0 - frame and the observer independent 4-vectors Ea and Ba. In the tensor
4-vectors Ea
formalism the passive LT are used. All quantities in the Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations derived with the use of
1-vectors E and B, bivectors EHL and BHL and the abstract 4-vectors Ea and Ba are geometric, coordinate-free
quantities, i.e., quantities that are deﬁned without reference frames. All such equations are completely equivalent to

f and Ba

the ﬁeld equations with F (given, e.g. in [7-9] and discussed in detail in [10]) or with F ab (already presented, e.g., in
[11]). It can be concluded from the consideration presented in all mentioned sections that the proof of a fundamental
disagreement between the standard electromagnetism and the special relativity (SR) does not depend on the character
of the 4D algebric objects used to represent the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The discussion and a short comparison
with some experiments are given in section V. (We note that the comparison of the geometric approach to SR and
the standard formulation of SR with experiments that test SR is also given in detail in [12].) The summary and
conclusions are presented in section VI.

II. THE PROOF IN THE GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA FORMALISM
USING 1-VECTORS E AND B

For the standard formulation of electrodynamics with the Cliﬀord multivectors, see, e.g., [7-9]. (A modern and very
stimulating mathematical treatment of the Cliﬀord algebra and the geometric calculus is presented in [13]. ) In [7-9]
the electromagnetic ﬁeld is represented by a bivector-valued function F = F (x) on the spacetime. The source of the
ﬁeld is the electromagnetic current j which is a 1-vector ﬁeld and the gradient operator ∂ is also 1-vector. A single
ﬁeld equation for F is ﬁrst given by M. Riesz [14] as

∂F = j/ε0c,

∂ · F + ∂ ∧ F = j/ε0c.

(1)

The trivector part is identically zero in the absence of magnetic charge. The geometric (Cliﬀord) product is written
by simply juxtaposing multivectors AB. The dot ′·′ and wedge ′∧′ in (1) denote the inner and outer products
respectively. All quantities in (1) are deﬁned without reference frames; they are observer independent quantities, i.e.,
they are independent of the reference frame and the chosen system of coordinates in that frame. Consequently the
equation (1) is a Lorentz invariant equation. In fact, it is independent of even an indirect reference to an inertial
system. In the geometric algebra formalism (as in the tensor formalism as well) one mainly deals either with 4D
quantities that are deﬁned without reference frames, e.g., Cliﬀord multivector F (the abstract tensor F ab) or, when
some basis has been introduced, with coordinate-based geometric quantity (CBGQ) that comprises both components
and a basis. The SR that exclusively deals with quantities deﬁned without reference frames or, equivalently, with
CBGQs, can be called the invariant SR. The reason for this name is that upon the passive LT any CBGQ remains
unchanged. The invariance of some 4D CBGQ upon the passive LT reﬂects the fact that such mathematical, invariant,
geometric 4D quantity represents the same physical object for relatively moving observers. It is taken in the invariant
SR that such 4D geometric quantities are well-deﬁned not only mathematically but also experimentally, as measurable
quantities with real physical meaning. Thus they do have an independent physical reality. The invariant SR is discussed
in [11,12] in the tensor formalism and in [10,15] in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism. It is explicitly shown in [12] that the
true agreement with experiments that test SR exists when the theory deals with well-deﬁned 4D quantities, i.e., the
quantities that are invariant upon the passive LT. The generally accepted agreement between these experiments and
the standard formulation of SR is only an ”apparent” agreement caused by the fact that in the standard treatments
only parts of the relevant 4D quantities are considered and thus not the whole 4D quantities, see [12].

In the usual geometric algebra formalism, e.g., [7-9], instead of working only with such observer independent
quantities one introduces (in order to get a more familiar form for (1)) a space-time split and the relative vectors in
the γ0 - frame, i.e., a particular time-like direction γ0 is singled out. γ0 is tangent to the world line of an observer at
rest in the γ0 - frame.

(The generators of the spacetime algebra are four basis vectors {γµ} , µ = 0...3, satisfying γµ · γν = ηµν = diag(+ −
−−). This basis is a right-handed orthonormal frame of vectors in the Minkowski spacetime M 4 with γ0 in the
forward light cone. The γk (k = 1, 2, 3) are spacelike vectors. The γµ generate by multiplication a complete basis,
the standard basis, for spacetime algebra: 1, γµ, γµ ∧ γν , γµγ5,γ5 (16 independent elements). γ5 is the pseudoscalar for
the frame {γµ} . It is worth noting that the standard basis corresponds, in fact, to the speciﬁc system of coordinates,
i.e., to Einstein’s system of coordinates. In the Einstein system of coordinates the Einstein synchronization [2] of
distant clocks and Cartesian space coordinates xi are used in the chosen inertial frame of reference. However diﬀerent
systems of coordinates of an inertial frame of reference are allowed and they are all equivalent in the description
of physical phenomena. For example, in [11] two very diﬀerent, but completely equivalent systems of coordinates,
the Einstein system of coordinates and ”radio” (”r”) system of coordinates, are exposed and exploited throughout
the paper. The connection between the basis vectors in the ”r” and in the Einstein system of coordinates is given
as r0 = γ0, ri = γ0 + γi. Thence the metric tensor gµν,r in the ”r” system of coordinates is given as g00,r =
gii,r = 0; the metric tensor gµν,r is not the same as the Minkowski metric tensor
g0i,r = gi0,r = gij,r(i 6= j) = −1,
ηµν = diag(+ − −−). We note that in SR, i.e., in the theory of ﬂat spacetime, any speciﬁc gµν (for the speciﬁc system
of coordinates) can be transformed to the Minkowski metric tensor ηµν; for example, gµν,r is transformed by the
ν,r)−1 given in [11] to ηµν . The coordinate system in which g0i = 0 at every point in 4D spacetime is called
matrix (T µ

time-orthogonal since in it the time axis is everywhere orthogonal to the spatial coordinate curves. This happens in
the cases when in some inertial frame of reference the Einstein synchronization is chosen together with, e.g., Cartesian,
or polar, or spherical, etc., spatial coordinates. However it is not the case when the ”r” synchronization is chosen. It is
almost always tacitly assumed in both geometric algebra and tensor formalisms that, e.g., for the spacetime algebra,
[7] Space-Time Calculus: ”a given inertial system is completely characterized by a single future-pointing, timelike
unit vector.” In this case it refers to the unit vector in the time direction, γ0 basis vector, and the inertial system
characterized by γ0 is refered to as the γ0 - frame, or the γ0 - system. The preceding discussion shows that the above
claim from [7] is not true in general. Namely γ0 and r0 are the same vectors (γ0, i.e., r0, is the unit vector directed
along the world line of the clock at the origin), but the spatial basis vectors γi and ri are very diﬀerent and moreover
r0 is not orthogonal to ri. (The spatial basis vectors by deﬁnition connect simultaneous events, the event ”clock at
rest at the origin reads 0 time” with the event ”clock at rest at unit distance from the origin reads 0 time,” and thus
they are synchronization-dependent. The spatial basis vector ei connects two above mentioned simultaneous events
when Einstein’s synchronization of distant clocks is used. The spatial basis vector ri connects two above mentioned
simultaneous events when ”radio” clock synchronization of distant clocks is used. All this is explained in more detail
in [11].) This means that the usual space-time split and the relative vectors, e.g., [7-9], are obtained not only by
singling out a particular time-like direction γ0 but also implicitly assuming that the whole standard basis {γµ} (i.e.,
the Einstein system of coordinates) is chosen. In this paper, for the sake of brevity and of clearness of the whole
exposition, we shall also work only with standard basis {γµ}, but remembering that the approach with 4D quantities
that are deﬁned without reference frames holds for any choice of the basis.)

The bivector ﬁeld F is decomposed in the γ0 - frame into electric and magnetic parts using diﬀerent algebric objects
to represent these ﬁelds. The explicit appearance of γ0 in these expressions implies that the space-time split is observer
dependent and thus all quantities obtained by the space-time split in the γ0 - frame are observer dependent quantities.
In [7,8] the observer independent F ﬁeld from (1) is expressed in terms of observer dependent quantities, i.e., as the
sum of a relative vector EH and a relative bivector γ5BH

F = EH + cγ5BH , EH = (F · γ0)γ0 = (1/2)(F − γ0F γ0),

γ5BH = (1/c)(F ∧ γ0)γ0 = (1/2c)(F + γ0F γ0).

(The subscript ’H’ is for - Hestenes.) Both EH and BH are, in fact, bivectors. Similarly in [9] F is decomposed
in terms of observer dependent quantities, 1-vector EJ and a bivector BJ (the subscript ’J’ is for - Jancewicz) as
F = γ0 ∧ EJ − cBJ , where EJ = F · γ0 and BJ = −(1/c)(F ∧ γ0)γ0. The F ﬁeld can be also decomposed in terms of
another algebric objects; the observer dependent electric and magnetic parts of F are represented with 1-vectors that
are denoted as Ef and Bf (see also [6] and [15]). The physical description with 1-vectors Ef and Bf is simpler but
completely equivalent to the description with the bivectors EH , BH [7,8] or with 1-vector EJ and a bivector BJ [9].
Such decomposition of F is not only simpler but also much closer to the classical representation of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds by the 3D vectors E and B than those used in [7-9]. Thus

F = Ef ∧ γ0 + c(γ5Bf ) · γ0,
Ef = F · γ0, Bf = −(1/c)γ5(F ∧ γ0).

Having at our disposal diﬀerent decompositions of F into observer dependent quantities we proceed to present the
proof that the classical electromagnetism and the SR are not in agreement ﬁrst using the decomposition (3) and then
(2). (We shall not deal with the decomposition of F into EJ and BJ from [9] since both the procedure and the results
are completely the same as with (3) and (2).)

A. The ﬁeld equations in the γ0 - frame. The Maxwell equations

When (3) is introduced into the ﬁeld equation for F (1) we ﬁnd

∂[(F · γ0) ∧ γ0 + (F ∧ γ0) · γ0] = j/ε0c
∂(Ef ∧ γ0 + c(γ5Bf ) · γ0) = j/ε0c.

The equations (4) can be now written as coordinate-based geometric equations in the standard basis {γµ} and the
second equation becomes

{∂α[δαβ

f γµ = 0γ0 + (−1/2c)ε0kliFklγi.

f = F i0, Bi

f = (−1/2c)ε0kliFkl.

Thence the components of Ef and Bf in the {γµ} basis (i.e., in the Einstein system of coordinates) are

The relation (7) is nothing else than the standard identiﬁcation of the components F µν with the components of the
3D vectors E and B, see, e.g., [3,4]. (It is worth noting that Einstein’s fundamental work [16] is the earliest reference
on covariant electrodynamics and on the identiﬁcation of some components of F αβ with the components of the 3D E
and B.) We see that if the standard basis {γµ} is chosen in an inertial frame of reference, the γ0 - frame, in which
the observers who measure the basis components Eα
f and Bα
f are at rest, i.e., their velocity v is v = cγ0, or in the
components vα = (c, 0, 0, 0), then in the γ0 - frame Ef and Bf do not have the temporal components E0
f = 0.
Thus Ef and Bf actually refer to the 3D subspace orthogonal to the speciﬁc timelike direction γ0. Notice that we
can select a particular - but otherwise arbitrary - inertial frame of reference as the γ0 - frame, to which we shall refer
as the frame of our ’ﬁducial’ observers (for this name see [17]). The subscript ′f ′ in the above relations stands for
- ﬁducial - and denotes the explicit dependence of these quantities on the γ0-, i.e., ’ﬁducial’- observer. Using that
E0

f = 0 and (γ0)µ = (1, 0, 0, 0) the equation (5) becomes

(8)

The ﬁrst part (with γα) in (8) is from the 1-vector part of (4), i.e., (5), while the second one (with γ5γα) is from the
trivector (pseudovector) part of (4), i.e., (5). Both parts in (8) are written as coordinate-based geometric equations
in the standard basis {γµ} and cannot be further simpliﬁed as geometric equations. In the ﬁrst part (with γα) in (8)
one recognizes two Maxwell equations in the component form, the Gauss law for the electric ﬁeld (the ﬁrst bracket,
with γ0) and the Amp`ere-Maxwell law (the second bracket, with γi). Similarly from the second part (with γ5γα) in
(8) we recognize the component form of another two Maxwell equations, the Gauss law for the magnetic ﬁeld (with
γ5γ0) and Faraday’s law (with γ5γi).

B. Lorentz transformations of the Maxwell equations

Let us now apply the active Lorentz transformations upon (8), or (5). We write (8), or (5), in the form

aαγα + bα(γ5γα) = 0.

The coeﬃcients aα and bα are clear from (8), or (5); they are the usual Maxwell equations in the component form. In
the Cliﬀord algebra formalism, e.g., [7-9], the LT are considered as active transformations; the components of, e.g.,
some 1-vector relative to a given inertial frame of reference (with the standard basis {γµ}) are transformed into the
components of a new 1-vector relative to the same frame (the basis {γµ} is not changed). Furthermore the LT are
R = p′µγµ. To an observer in the {γµ} frame the
described with rotors R, R
vector p′ appears the same as the vector p appears to an observer in the
frame. For boosts in the direction γ1
the rotor R is given by the relation

R = 1, in the usual way as p → p′ = Rp

β is the scalar velocity in units of c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2. Then the LT of (4) are given as

R{∂[(F · γ0) ∧ γ0 + (F ∧ γ0) · γ0] − j/ε0c}

R = 0,

where R is given by (10). (A coordinate-free form of the LT is also given in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism in [15]
and in the tensor formalism in [11]. The form presented in [15] does not need to use rotors but, of course, it can be
expressed by rotors as well.) Then the LT of (9) are

Performing the LT we ﬁnd the explicit expression for (12) as

γ0(γa0 − βγa1) + γ1(γa1 − βγa0) + γ2a2 + γ3a3+
γ5γ0(γb0 − βγb1) + γ5γ1(γb1 − βγb0) + γ5γ2b2 + γ5γ3b3 = 0.

It can be simply written as

a′αγα + b′α(γ5γα) = 0,

where, e.g., a′0 = γa0 − βγa1 and, as it is said, aα and bα are the usual Maxwell equations in the component form
given in (8), or (5). This result (13), i.e., (14), is exactly the usual result for the active LT of a 1-vector and of a
pseudovector. It is important to note that, e.g., the Gauss law for the electric ﬁeld a0 does not transform by the LT
again to the Gauss law but to a′0, which is a combination of the Gauss law and a part of the Amp`ere-Maxwell law
(a1).

The second equation in (11) can be expressed in terms of Lorentz transformed derivatives and Lorentz transformed

1-vectors Ef and Bf as

a0 is the Gauss law for the electric ﬁeld written in the component form. It is clear from (18) that the LT do not
transform the Gauss law into the ’primed’ Gauss law but into quite diﬀerent law (18); a′0 contains the time component
E′0
f = 0), and also the new ”Gauss law” includes the derivatives of the magnetic ﬁeld. The same situation
happens with other Lorentz transformed terms, which explicitly shows that the Lorentz transformed ME ((15) with
(18)) are not of the same form as the original ones (8). This is a fundamental result which reveals that, contrary to
the previous derivations, e.g., [2,16], [3,4], [7-9], and contrary to the general opinion, the usual ME are not Lorentz
covariant equations. The physical consequences of this achievement will be very important and they will be carefully
examined.

C. Standard transformations of the Maxwell equations

In contrast to the correct active Lorentz transformations of Ef (16) and Bf (17) it is wrongly assumed in the usual
derivations of the the ST for E′
st (the subscript - st - is for - standard) that the quantities obtained by the
active LT of Ef and Bf are again in the 3D subspace of the γ0 - observer (see also [6]). This means that it is wrongly
assumed in all standard derivations, e.g., in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism [7,9] (and in the tensor formalism [3,4] as
well), that one can again perform the same identiﬁcation of the transformed components F ′µν with the components
of the 3D E′ and B′ as in (7). Thus it is taken in standard derivations that for the transformed E′

As can be seen from (19) and (20), i.e., from (21), the transformations for E′i
st. are exactly the ST of compo-
nents of the 3D vectors E and B that are quoted in almost every textbook and paper on relativistic electrodynamics
including [2] and [3,4]. These relations are explicitly derived and given in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism, e.g., in
[7], Space-Time Algebra (eq. (18.22)), New Foundations for Classical Mechanics (Ch. 9 eqs. (3.51a,b)), in [8] Ge-
ometric algebra for physicists (Ch. 7.1.2 eq. (7.33)) and in [9] (Ch. 7 eqs. (20a,b)). Notice that, in contrast to
the active Lorentz transformations (16) and (17), according to the ST (19), i.e., (21), the transformed components

In all
previous treatments of SR, e.g., [7-9] (and [2-4]) the transformations for E′i
st. are considered to be the Lorentz
transformations of the 3D electric and magnetic ﬁelds. However the above analysis, and [5,6] as well, show that the
transformations for E′i
st. (21) are derived from the relativistically incorrect transformations (19) and (20),
which are not the Lorentz transformations; the Lorentz transformations are given by the relations (16) and (17).

It is also argued in all previous works, starting in the year 1905 with Einstein’s fundamental paper on SR [2], that
the usual ME with the 3D E and B are Lorentz covariant equations. The relation (15) together with (18) shows that
it is not true; the Lorentz transformed ME are not of the same form as the original ones. Here we explicitly show
that in the standard derivations the ME remain unchanged in form not upon the LT but upon some transformations
which, strictly speaking, have nothing to do with the LT of the equation (4), i.e., of the usual ME (8). The diﬀerence
between the Lorentz transformed ME, given by (11) or ﬁnally by (15) with (18) (or by (13)) and the equations (given
below) obtained by applying the ST is the same as it is the diﬀerence between the LT of Ef (Bf ) given by (16) ((17))
and their ST given by (19) ((20)). Thus the ST of the equation (4) are

where E′
st are deﬁned by (19) and (20). Notice that, in contrast to the correct LT (11) or (15), γ0 is not
transformed in (22). The second equation in (22) is of the same form as the second equation in (4) but with primed
st ﬁelds and the primed current j′ replacing the corresponding unprimed quantities. When
derivative ∂′, E′
this second equation in (22) is written as a coordinate-based geometric equation in the standard basis {γµ} it becomes

The equation (23) is of the same form as the original ME (8) but the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are not transformed
by the LT than by the ST. Therefore, as can be seen from (22) (together with (19) and (20)), the equation (23) is not
the LT of the original ME (8); the LT of the ME (8) are the equations (15) with (18) (i.e., (13)) where the Lorentz
transformed electric and magnetic ﬁelds are given by the relations (16) and (17).

D. Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations with 1-vectors E and B

Instead of to decompose F into the observer dependent Ef and Bf in the γ0 - frame, as in (3), we present here an
observer independent decomposition of F into 1-vectors of the electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds that are deﬁned without
reference frames, i.e., they are independent of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in
it, see also [15]. We deﬁne

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (e5B) · v,

E = (1/c)F · v,

e5B = (1/c2)F ∧ v, B = −(1/c2)e5(F ∧ v),

(24)

where the pseudoscalar e5 of some basis {eµ}, that does not need to be the standard basis {γµ}, is deﬁned as
e5 = e0 ∧ e1 ∧ ∧e2 ∧ e3. It holds that E · v = B · v = 0 (since F is skew-symmetric). v in (24) can be interpreted as

7

(25)

(26)

(27)

the velocity (1-vector) of a family of observers who measures E and B ﬁelds. The velocity v and all other quantities
entering into (24) are deﬁned without reference frames. v characterizes some general observer. Thus both relations
in (24) hold for any observer. However it has to be emphasized that (24) is not a physical deﬁnition of E and B;
the physical deﬁnition has to be given in terms of the Lorentz force and Newton’s second law as, e.g., in [15]. The
relations (24) actually establish the equivalence of the formulation of electrodynamics with the ﬁeld bivector F and
the formulation with 1-vectors of the electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds. (Recently [10] I have presented a complete
formulation of the electrodynamics using exclusively the bivector ﬁeld F.) Both formulations, with F and E, B ﬁelds,
are equivalent formulations, but every of them is a complete, consistent and self-contained formulation. When (24) is
used the ﬁeld equation for F (1) becomes

∂((1/c)E ∧ v + (e5B) · v) = j/ε0c.

In contrast to the ﬁeld equation (4), that holds only for the γ0-observer, the ﬁeld equation (25) holds for any observer;
the quantities entering into (25) are all deﬁned without reference frames. The equation (25) is physicaly completely
equivalent to the ﬁeld equation for F (1). In some basis {eµ} , that does not need to be the standard basis {γµ} , the
ﬁeld equation (25) can be written as a coordinate-based geometric equation

where Eα and Bα are the basis components of the electric and magnetic 1-vectors E and B, and δαβ

The ﬁrst part in (26) (it contains sources) emerges from ∂ · F = j/ε0c and the second one (the source-free part) is
obtained from ∂ ∧ F = 0, see also [15]. Instead of to work with the observer independent ﬁeld equation in the F -
formulation (1) one can equivalently use the E, B - formulation with the ﬁeld equation (25), or in the {eµ} basis
(26). (The complete E, B - formulation of the relativistic electrodynamics will be reported elsewhere.) We remark
that (26) follows from (25) for those systems of coordinates for which the basis 1-vectors eµ are constant, e.g., the
standard basis {γµ} (the Einstein system of coordinates). For a nonconstant basis, for example, when one uses polar or
spherical basis 1- vectors (and, e.g., the Einstein synchronization) then one must also diﬀerentiate these nonconstant
basis 1-vectors. Furthermore one can completely forget the manner in which the equation with E and B is obtained,
i.e., the ﬁeld equation with F (1), and consider the equation with E and B (25), which is deﬁned without reference
frames, or the corresponding coordinate-based geometric equation (26), as the primary and fundamental equations
for the whole classical electromagnetism. In such correct relativistic formulation of the electromagnetism the ﬁeld
equation with 1- vectors E and B (25) takes over the role of the usual ME with the 3D E and B, i.e., of the ME (8).
We note that the equivalent formulation of electrodynamics with tensors Ea and Ba is reported in [11,18] while the
component form in the Einstein system of coordinates is given in [17,19] and [20].

Let us now take that in (26) the standard basis {γµ} is used instead of some general basis {eµ} . Then (26) can
µν vµcBν +
be written as Cβγβ + Dβγ5γβ = 0, where Cβ = ∂α(δαβ
εαβµνvµEν ). When the active LT are applied upon such (26) with the {γµ} basis the equation remains of the same form
but with primed quantities replacing the unprimed ones (of course the basis is unchanged). This can be immediately
seen since the equation (26) is written in a manifestly covariant form. Thus the Lorentz transformed (26) is

What is the relation between the relativistically correct ﬁeld equation (25) or (26) and the usual ME (8). From
the above discussion and from section II.A. one concludes that if in (25) we specify the velocity v of the observers
who measure E and B ﬁelds to be v = cγ0, then the equation (25) becomes the equation (4). Further choosing the
standard basis {γµ} in the γ0 - frame, in which v = cγ0, or in the components vα = (c, 0, 0, 0), then in that γ0 - frame
E and B become Ef and Bf and they do not have the temporal components E0
f = 0. The coordinate-based
geometric equation (26) becomes the usual Maxwell equations (8). Thus the usual Cliﬀord algebra treatments of the
electromagnetism [7-9] with the space-time split in the γ0 - frame and the usual ME (8) are simply obtained from our
observer independent formulation with ﬁeld equation (25) or (26) choosing that v = cγ0 and choosing the standard
basis {γµ}. We see that the correspondence principle is simply satisﬁed in this formulation with E and B ﬁelds; all
results obtained in the previous treatments from the usual Maxwell equations with the 3D E and B remain valid in the
formulation with the 1-vectors E and B if physical phenomena are considered only in one inertial frame of reference.
Namely the selected inertial frame of reference can be chosen to be the γ0 - frame with the {γµ} basis. Then there, as

f = B0

explained above, the coordinate-based geometric equation (26) can be reduced to the equations containing only the
components, the four Maxwell equations in the component form, the ME (8). Thus for observers who are at rest in
the γ0 - frame (v = cγ0) the components of the 3D E and B can be simply replaced by the space components of the
1-vectors E and B in the {γµ} basis. We remark that just such observers are usually considered in the conventional
formulation with the 3D E and B. The dependence of the ﬁeld equations (26) on v reﬂects the arbitrariness in the
selection of the γ0 - frame but at the same time it makes the equations (26) independent of that choice. The γ0 -
frame can be selected at our disposal, which proves that we don’t have a kind of the ”preferred” frame theory. All
experimental results that are obtained in one inertial frame of reference can be equally well explained by our geometric
formulation of electrodynamics with the 1-vectors E and B as they are explained by the usual ME with the 3D E and
B.

R, E′ = REf

However there is a fundamental diﬀerence between the standard approach with the 3D E and B and the approach
with 4D quantities E and B that are deﬁned without reference frames. It is considered in all standard treatments
that the equation (23) is the LT of the original ME (8). But, as shown here, the equation (23) is not the LT of the
original ME (8); the LT of the ME (8) are the equations (13) (i.e., (14) with (18), or (15)). The ME (8) are obtained
from our ﬁeld equation (26) by putting that v = cγ0 and choosing the standard basis {γµ}. In the same way the
equations (27), which are the LT of the equations (26), become the LT of the ME (8), that is, the equations (13) (or
(14) with (18), or (15)), when in (27) it is taken that v′, ∂′, E′ and B′ are the LT of v = cγ0, ∂, Ef and Bf , that is,
R=B′
v′ = R(cγ0)
R, ∂′ = R∂
f . We recall from section II.B. that to an observer in the
{γµ} frame the vector p′ (p′ = Rp
R = p′µγµ) appears the same as the vector p (p = pµγµ) appears to an observer in
frame. This, together with the preceding discussion, show that the usual ME with the 3D E and B, i.e., the
the
equation (8) and the equation (23) obtained by the ST from (8), cannot be used for the explanation of any experiment
that test SR, i.e., in which relatively moving observers have to compare their data obtained by measurements on the
same physical object. In contrast to the description of the electromagnetism with the 3D E and B, the description
with 4D ﬁelds E and B, i.e., with the equations (26) and (27), is correct not only in the γ0 - frame with the standard
basis {γµ} but in all other relatively moving frames and it holds for any permissible choice of coordinates, i.e., basis
{eµ}. We see that the relativistically correct ﬁelds E and B and the new ﬁeld equations (25) and (26) do not have
the same physical interpretation as the usual 3D ﬁelds E and B and the usual 3D ME (8) except in the γ0 - frame
with the {γµ} basis in which E0 = B0 = 0. This consideration completely deﬁnes the relation between our approach
with 4D E and B and all previous approaches.

III. THE PROOF IN THE GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA FORMALISM
USING BIVECTORS EH AND BH

A. The ﬁeld equations in the γ0 - frame. The Maxwell equations

The same proof and the whole consideration as in section II. can be repeated using in the γ0 - frame with the {γµ}
basis the decomposition of F into the bivectors EH and BH (2) instead of the decomposition of F into 1-vectors Ef
and Bf (3). It will be seen that the type of the algebric object chosen to represent the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
is irrelevant for the whole consideration and for the obtained results. We shall brieﬂy repeat the main results from
section II. but starting with EH and BH instead of Ef and Bf . When the decomposition (2) is substituted into the
ﬁeld equations (1) we ﬁnd

∂[(F · γ0) ∧ γ0 + (F ∧ γ0) · γ0] = j/ε0c,
∂(EH + cγ5BH ) = j/ε0c.

All quantities in (28) can be written as CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ}, see [6],

EH = F i0γi ∧ γ0, BH = (1/2c)εkli0Fklγi ∧ γ0.

It is seen from (29) that both bivectors EH and BH are parallel to γ0, that is, it holds that EH ∧ γ0 = BH ∧
γ0 = 0. Further it follows from (29) that the components of EH , BH in the {γµ} basis give rise to the tensor
(components) (EH )µν = γν · (γµ · EH ) = (γν ∧ γµ) · EH , (and the same for (BH )µν ) which, written out as a matrix,
have entries

(EH )i0 = F i0 = −(EH)0i = Ei,
(BH )i0 = (1/2c)εkli0Fkl = −(BH )0i = Bi,

(EH )ij = 0,

(BH )ij = 0.

8

(28)

(29)

(30)

Then (29) becomes

EH = (EH )i0γi ∧ γ0 = Eiγi ∧ γ0,
BH = (BH )i0γi ∧ γ0 = Biγi ∧ γ0.

Multiplying (28) by γ0 and using (29) and (30) we write the resulting equations as a coordinate-based geometric
equation

(∂kEk − j0/cε0) + (∂0Ei − cεijk0∂jBk + ji/cε0)(γi ∧ γ0)+

(c∂kBk)γ5 + (c∂0Bi + εijk0∂jEk)γ5(γi ∧ γ0) = 0.

The equation (32) is exactly the same as the equations obtained in the standard geometric algebra formalism, e.g.,
(8.5) and (8.6a-8.6d) in [7] Space-Time Algebra, but now written as a coordinate-based geometric equation. (32)
encodes all four ME in the component form in the same way as it happens with the equation (8). It is worth noting
that this step, the multiplication of (28) by γ0, in order to get the usual ME, is unnecessary in the formulation from
section II. with 1-vectors Ef and Bf . This shows that the approach with 1-vectors Ef and Bf is simpler than the
approach with bivectors EH and BH and also it is much closer to the classical formulation of the electromagnetism
with the 3D vectors E and B.

B. Lorentz transformations of the Maxwell equations

Let us now apply the active LT (using (10)) to (32). First we rewrite (32) in the form

a0 + ai(γi ∧ γ0) + b0γ5 + biγ5(γi ∧ γ0) = 0.

The coeﬃcients a0, ai and b0, bi are clear from (32); they are the usual ME in the component form. As it is said the
usual ME (32), i.e., (33), are obtained multiplying the equations (28) by γ0 The LT of the resulting equations (after
multiplication by γ0) are R{γ0[∂((F · γ0) ∧ γ0 + (F ∧ γ0) · γ0) − j/ε0c]}

R = 0, that is,

Then after applying the LT upon (32), i.e., (33), we ﬁnd

R{γ0[∂(EH + cγ5BH ) − j/ε0c]}

e
R = 0.

e

a0 + R[ai(γi ∧ γ0)]

R + b0γ5 + R[biγ5(γi ∧ γ0)]

R = 0,

where R[ai(γi ∧ γ0)]
R =
b1(γ3 ∧ γ2) + γ[−b2(γ3 ∧ γ1) + b3(γ2 ∧ γ1)] + βγ[b2(γ3 ∧ γ0) − b3(γ2 ∧ γ0)]. This result (35) is the usual result for the
active LT of a multivector from (33).

R = a1(γ1 ∧ γ0) + γ[a2(γ2 ∧ γ0) + a3(γ3 ∧ γ0)] − βγ[a2(γ2 ∧ γ1) + a3(γ3 ∧ γ1)] and R[biγ5(γi ∧ γ0)]

H ∧ γ0 = 0 and thus there are (E′

(1/2c)εkli0Fkl. Both (37) and (38) are the familiar forms for the active LT of bivectors, here EH and BH .
It
is worth noting that E′
H , in contrast to EH and BH , are not parallel to γ0, i.e., it does not hold that
E′
H )ij 6= 0. Further, as it happens for Ef and Bf , see (16)
and (17), the components (EH )µν ((BH )µν ) transform upon the active LT again to the components (E′
H )µν ((B′
H )µν );
there is no mixing of components. Thus by the active LT EH transforms to E′
H . Actually, as we said,
this is the way in which every bivector transforms upon the active LT. The last form of the Lorentz transformed ﬁeld
equation, (36), can be written as a coordinate-based geometric equation in the standard basis {γµ}, but for simplicity
we only quote the scalar term a′0

Comparing a′0 (39) with a0 from the usual ME (32), i.e., (33), a0 = ∂k(EH )k0 − j0/cε0, we again see, as in section II.B
with Ef and Bf , that a′0 substantially diﬀers in form from the term a0 in (32). Again the same situation happens
with other transformed terms, which shows, as in section II.B, that the Lorentz transformed ME, (36) with (39), are
not of the same form as the original ones (32), i.e., (33). This is a fundamental result which once again reveals that,
contrary to the previous derivations, e.g., [2,16], [3,4], [7-9], and contrary to the generally accepted belief, the usual
ME are not Lorentz covariant equations.

C. Standard transformations of the Maxwell equations

As can be easily shown, see also [6], the ST for E′

H,st are derived wrongly assuming that the quantities
obtained by the active LT of EH and BH are again parallel to γ0, i.e., that again holds E′
H ∧ γ0 = 0 and
consequently that (E′
H,st)ij = 0. Thence, in contrast to the correct LT of EH and BH , (37) and (38)
respectively, it is taken in standard derivations ([7], Space-Time Algebra (eq. (18.22)), New Foundations for Classical
Mechanics (Ch. 9 eqs. (3.51a,b)), [8] Geometric algebra for physicists (Ch. 7.1.2 eq. (7.33))) that

where F ′ = RF

H,st

B′

H,st = (−1/c)γ5[(F ′ ∧ γ0) · γ0)] = (B′

stγi ∧ γ0 =

B1γ1 ∧ γ0 + (γB2 + βγE3/c)γ2 ∧ γ0 + (γB3 − βγE2/c)γ3 ∧ γ0.

The relations (40) and (41) immediately give the familiar expressions for the ST of the 3D vectors E and B. Now, in
contrast to the correct LT of EH and BH, (37) and (38) respectively, the components of the transformed E′
H,st are
expressed by the mixture of components Ei and Bi, and the same holds for B′

H,st.

Here we again explicitly show that in the standard derivations [7-9] the ME (32) remain unchanged in form not
upon the LT but upon some transformations which, strictly speaking, have nothing to do with the LT of the equation
(32). Namely the ST of the second equation in (28) (after multiplication by γ0) are given as

γ0[∂′(E′

H,st + cγ5B′

H,st) − j′/ε0c] = 0,

H,st and B′

where E′
H,st are determined by (40) and (41). Notice again that, in contrast to the correct LT (34) or (36),
γ0 is not transformed in (42), as it is not transformed in the ST of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (40) and (41).
When (42) is written as a coordinate-based geometric equation in the standard basis {γµ} it becomes

jE′

st,k)γ5(γi ∧ γ0) = 0.

The equation (43) is of the same form as the original ME (32) but the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are not transformed
by the LT than by the ST. As seen from (42) (together with (40) and (41)) the equation (43) is not the LT of the
original ME (32); the LT of the ME (32) is the equation (36) with (39) (i.e., (34) or (35)), where the Lorentz
transformed electric and magnetic ﬁelds are given by the relations (37) and (38).

As explained in the preceding sections the observer independent F ﬁeld is decomposed in (2) (see [7,8]) in terms
of observer dependent quantities, i.e., as the sum of a relative vector EH and a relative bivector γ5BH , by making
the space-time split in the γ0 - frame. But, similarly as in section II.D., we present here an observer independent
decomposition of F into bivectors EHL and BHL that are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., which are independent
of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it. We deﬁne

F = EHL + cγ5BHL, EHL = (1/c2)(F · v) ∧ v

BHL = −(1/c3)γ5[(F ∧ v) · v],

γ5BHL = (1/c3)(F ∧ v) · v

(The subscript ’HL’ is for - Hestenes, Lasenby, see [21].) Of course, as in II.D., the velocity v and all other quantities
entering into (44) are deﬁned without reference frames. Consequently (44) holds for any observer. When (44) is used
the ﬁeld equation for F (1), after multiplication by v/c (instead of by γ0), becomes

(v/c){∂(EHL + cγ5BHL) − j/ε0c} = 0.

In contrast to the ﬁeld equation (28) that holds only for the γ0-observer, the ﬁeld equation (45) holds for any observer;
the quantities entering into (45) are all deﬁned without reference frames. The equation (45) is physicaly completely
equivalent to the ﬁeld equation for F (1), i.e., to the ﬁeld equation with 1- vectors E and B (25). (The equation
(28) corresponds to the equation (4), while (45) corresponds to (25).) The ﬁeld equation (45) can be written as a
coordinate-based geometric equation, and it looks much more complicated than the equation (26) with 1- vectors E
and B. We write it (for better comparison) as two equations; the ﬁrst one will yield the scalar and bivector parts of
(32) when v/c = γ0. It is

(1/c)vβ∂α(EHL)αβ + [(1/2c)vα∂α(EHL)βσ − (1/2)εµνασvβ∂α(BHL)µν ]γβ ∧ γσ
= (1/ε0c2)(vαjα + vβjσγβ ∧ γσ).

The second equation will yield the pseudoscalar and pseudobivector parts of (32) when v/c = γ0 and it is

vβ∂α(BHL)αβγ5 + (1/2)vα∂α(BHL)µν γ5(γµ ∧ γν) + (vβ∂α − vα∂β)(EHL)αν γβ ∧ γν = 0.

The equation (46) is with sources and it emerges from ∂ · F = j/ε0c, while (47) is the source-free equation and it
emerges from ∂ ∧ F = 0. Comparing (46) and (47) in the EHL, BHL - formulation with the corresponding parts in
(26) with 1- vectors E and B we see that the formulation with E and B is much simpler and more elegant than the
formulation with bivectors EHL and BHL; the physical content is completely equivalent.

The equations (46) and (47) are written in a manifestly covariant form. This means that when the active LT
are applied upon such (46) and (47) the equations remain of the same form but with primed quantities replacing the
unprimed ones (of course the basis is unchanged).

The whole discussion from section II.D. (with 1- vectors E and B) about the correspondence principle applies
in the same measure to the formulation with bivectors EHL and BHL. The only diﬀerence is the simplicity of the
formulation with 1- vectors E and B.

The same conclusions hold for the formulation with 1-vector EJ and a bivector BJ from [9], but for the sake of

brevity that formulation will not be considered here.

IV. THE PROOF IN THE TENSOR FORMALISM USING
4-VECTORS Ea AND Ba

The same proof that the classical electromagnetism and SR are not in agreement can be given in the tensor formalism

as well. The important parts of this issue are already treated in two papers, [11] and [5].

Let us start with some general deﬁnitions. The electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F ab is deﬁned without reference frames,
i.e., it is an abstract tensor, a geometric quantity; Latin indices a,b,c, are to be read according to the abstract index
notation, as in [22] and [11,12], [18]. When some reference frame (a physical object) is introduced and the system of
coordinates (a mathematical object) is adopted in it, then F ab can be written as a CBGQ containing components and
a basis. As already said in the invariant formulation of SR that uses 4D quantities deﬁned without reference frames
[11,12], [18] and [5] in the tensor formalism, and [10,15] and [6] in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism, any permissible
system of coordinates, not necessary the Einstein system of coordinates, i.e., the standard basis {γµ}, can be used on
an equal footing. However, for simplicity, in this part we shall deal only with the standard basis {γµ}. When F ab is
written as a CBGQ it becomes F ab = F µν γµ ⊗ γν, where Greek indices µ, ν in F µν run from 0 to 3 and they denote
the components of the geometric object F ab in some system of coordinates, here the standard basis {γµ}. In the

12

(48)

(50)

(51)

(52)

tensor formalism γµ denote the basis 4-vectors (not components) forming the standard basis {γµ} and ′⊗′ denotes
the tensor product of the basis 4-vectors. In the tensor formalism I shall often denote the unit 4-vector in the time
direction γ0 as tb as well. Then in some reference frame with the standard basis {γµ} tb can be also written as a
CBGQ, tb = tµγµ, where tµ is a set of components of the unit 4-vector in the time direction (tµ =(1, 0, 0, 0)). Almost
always in the standard covariant approaches to SR one considers only the components of the geometric quantities
taken in the {γµ} basis and thus not the whole tensor. However the components are coordinate quantities and they
do not contain the whole information about the physical quantity.

A. The ﬁeld equations in the γ0 - frame. The Maxwell equations

In the abstract index notation the ﬁeld equations are given as

(−g)−1/2∂a((−g)1/2F ab) = jb/ε0c,

εabcd∂bFcd = 0

where g is the determinant of the metric tensor gab and ∂a is an ordinary derivative operator. Now there are two ﬁeld
equations while in the geometric algebra formalism they are united in only one ﬁeld equation. When written in the
{γµ} basis as coordinate-based geometric equations the relations (48) become

Notice that from (49) one simply ﬁnds the usual covariant form (the component form in the {γµ} basis) of the ﬁeld
equations with F αβ and its dual ∗F αβ

∂αF aβγβ = (1/ε0c)jβγβ,

∂α

∗F αβγβ = 0.

∂αF aβ = jβ/ε0c,

∂α

∗F αβ = 0,

where ∗F αβ = (1/2)εαβγδFγδ. In analogy with the geometric algebra formalism, F ab can be decomposed in terms of
the observer dependent 4-vectors Ea
f by singling out a particular time-like direction tb. (This corresponds to
the decomposition of F into 1-vectors Ef and Bf (3).) Thus

f and Ba

All quantities from (51) can be written as CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ} . Then in the tensor formalism we ﬁnd
the same equations as the equations (6) in the geometric algebra formalism with 1-vectors Ef and Bf . They are

f = (−1/2c)ε0kliFkl, which is, as already said, nothing else than the
whence we get the relation (7) Ei
standard identiﬁcation of the components F µν with the components of the 3D vectors E and B, see, e.g., [16], [3,4]. (As
mentioned previously Einstein’s fundamental work [16] is the earliest reference on generally covariant electrodynamics
and on the identiﬁcation of some components of F ab (actually F αβ) with the components of E and B. He introduces
an electromagnetic potential 4-vector (in component form) and from this constructs F aβ, the component form of
the F ab tensor. Then he writes the equations (50) and shows that these equations correspond to the usual Maxwell
equations with E and B if he makes the identiﬁcation given in the equations (7). It has to be mentioned that Einstein
actually worked with the equations for basis components in the {γµ} basis and thus not with the abstract tensors,
deﬁned without reference frames, or with coordinate-based geometric equations (see, e.g., [23] for the comparison of
Einstein’s view of spacetime and the modern view).) In fact, the whole discussion in connection with the relations
(6) and (7) applies in the same measure to (52). Thus in the rest frame of ’ﬁducial’ observers (we again call that
f do not have the temporal components E0
f = 0; in the γ0 - frame tµ can
frame - the γ0 - frame) Ea
be interpreted as the 4-velocity (the components in the {γµ} basis) of the observers that are at rest there. In the
standard treatments the 3-vectors E and B, as geometric quantities in the 3D space, are constructed from the spatial
components Ei and Bi from (52), i.e., (7), and the unit 3-vectors i, j, k, e.g., E =F 10i + F 20j + F 30k. These results
are quoted in numerous textbooks and papers treating relativistic electrodynamics in the tensor formalism, see, e.g.,
[16], [3,4]. Actually in the usual covariant approaches, e.g., [16], [3,4], one forgets about E0 and B0 components
and simply makes the identiﬁcation of six independent components of F µν with three components Ei, Ei = F i0,
and three components Bi, Bi = (1/2)εiklFlk. Since in SR we work with the 4D spacetime the mapping between the
components of F µν and the components of the 3D vectors E and B is mathematically better founded by the relations

f and Ba

f = B0

13

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

(52) than by their simple identiﬁcation. Therefore we proceed the consideration using (52). Note again that the whole
procedure is made in an inertial frame of reference with the standard basis {γµ}. In another system of coordinates
that is diﬀerent than the Einstein system of coordinates, e.g., diﬀering in the chosen synchronization (as it is the
’r’ synchronization considered in [11]), the identiﬁcation of Ei with F i0, as in (52), i.e., (7), (and also for Bi), is
impossible and meaningless. Further the components Ei and Bi are determined in the 4D spacetime in the standard
basis {γµ} . Thence when forming the geometric quantities the components would need to be multiplied with the unit
4-vectors γi and not with the unit 3-vectors.

Substituting (51) (but written in the {γµ} basis, where F αβ = δαβ

The same discussion holds for (54) ((53)) as for (8) ((5)).

B. Lorentz transformations of the Maxwell equations

Let us now apply the passive LT to the equations (53), or (54); in the tensor formalism we shall deal with the
f determined in the γ0 - frame (the S frame) from

transform the set of components (52) into (55). Note that E′µ
f do have the temporal components as well.
(B′µ
Further the components Eµ

mixing of components. Actually this is the way in which every well-deﬁned 4-vector (the components) transforms
upon the LT. A geometric quantity, an abstract tensor Ea, can be represented by CBGQs in S and S′ (both with
the Einstein system of coordinates) as Eµ
f are given by the relations (52) and (55)
respectively. All the primed quantities (components and the basis) are obtained from the corresponding unprimed
quantities through the LT. Of course it must hold that

since the components Eµ
f transform by the LT, while the basis γµ transforms by the inverse LT, thus leaving the whole
CBGQ invariant upon the passive LT. The invariance of some 4D CBGQ upon the passive LT is the crucial requirement
that must be satisﬁed by any well-deﬁned 4D quantity. It reﬂects the fact that such mathematical, invariant, geometric
4D quantity represents the same physical object for relatively moving observers. The use of CBGQs enables us to have
clearly and correctly deﬁned the concept of sameness of a physical system for diﬀerent observers. The importance of
this concept in SR was ﬁrst pointed out in [24,25]. However they also worked with components in the Einstein system
It is worth
of coordinates (the covariant quantities) and not with geometric quantities (the invariant quantities).
noting that in all other standard treatments, e.g., [2-4] (and [7-9] in the geometric algebra formalism), the importance
of such concept is completely overlooked what caused many diﬃculties in understanding SR. It can be easily checked
by the direct inspection that (56) holds when Eµ

f are given by (52) and (55). (The same holds for Ba.)

f and E′µ

The equations (53), or (54), can be written as aαγα = 0 and bαγα = 0, similarly to the equation (9). The coeﬃcients
aα and bα are clear from the ﬁrst and second equation respectively in (53), or (54); they are the usual Maxwell equations
in the component form. Then upon the passive LT the equations (53), or (54), transform to

a′αγ′

α = 0,

b′αγ′

α = 0,

(57)

and it holds, as for any 4-vector (a geometric quantity), that a′αγ′
α = bαγα; the coeﬃcients
transform by the LT as a′0 = γa0 − βγa1, a′1 = γa1 − βγa0, a′2 = a2, a′3 = a3 (and the same for b′α), while the
basis 4-vectors transform by the inverse LT as γ′
3 = γ3. Of course
tν transforms to v′ν and E′µ
f are given by (55). (The equation (57) corresponds to the equation (14) in the
geometric algebra formalism with 1-vectors Ef and Bf .) Again we see that, e.g., the Gauss law for the electric ﬁeld
a0 does not transform by the LT again to the Gauss law but to a′0, which is a combination of the Gauss law and a
part of the Amp`ere-Maxwell law (a1). When the coeﬃcients a′α and b′α are written in terms of the primed quantities
(from the S′ frame) they become (for simplicity only the coeﬃcient a′0 is written)

α = aαγα, and b′αγ′

and it is completely diﬀerent in form than the coeﬃcient a0 = (∂kEk
Again, it can be concluded from (58) that the LT do not transform the Gauss law into the ’primed’ Gauss law but
into a quite diﬀerent law; a′0 contains the time component E′0
f = 0. Also the
new ”Gauss law” includes the derivatives of the magnetic ﬁeld. The same situation happens with the other Lorentz
transformed terms, which once again explicitly shows that neither in the tensor formalism the Lorentz transformed
ME (57) with (58) are of the same form as the original ones (54). As discussed in section II.B. this fundamental
result reveals, in the tensor formalism as well, that, contrary to all previous derivations, e.g., [2-4], and contrary to
the generally accepted opinion, the usual ME are not Lorentz covariant equations.

C. Standard transformations of the Maxwell equations

In this section we present the derivation of the ST of the ME in the tensor formalism which is in a complete analogy
with the derivation in section II.C.. In all usual treatments, e.g., [3] and [4] eqs. (3.5) and (3.24), in S′ one again
simply makes the identiﬁcation of six independent components of F ′µν with three components E′i, E′i = F ′i0, and
three components B′i, B′i = (1/2)εiklF ′
lk. This means that standard treatments assume that under the passive LT the
set of components tν = (1, 0, 0, 0) from S transforms to t′ν = (1, 0, 0, 0) (t′ν are the components of the unit 4-vector
in the time direction in S′ and in the Einstein system of coordinates), and consequently that Eµ

(59) are not the LT of some well-deﬁned 4D quantities; the LT cannot transform a 4-vector for which the temporal
component is zero in one frame S to the 4-vector with the same property in relatively moving frame S′; i.e., they
cannot transform the unit 4-vector in the time direction in one frame S to the unit 4-vector in the time direction in
another relatively moving frame S′. Obviously E′µ

This means that, e.g., Eµ
µ are not the same quantity for observers in S and S′. As far as relativity is
concerned the quantities, e.g., Eµ
µ, are not related to one another. The observers in S and S′ are not
looking at the same physical object but at two diﬀerent objects; every observer makes measurement on its own object
and such measurements are not related by the LT. The transformations (59) are not the LT and E′µ
st., in
contrast to E′µ
f , are not well-deﬁned 4D quantities. From the relativistically incorrect transformations (59)
one simply derives the transformations of the spatial components E′i
st., which are the same as (21). It can
be again seen from (59), or (21), that the transformations of E′i
st. are exactly the ST of components of the 3-
vectors E and B that are obtained by Lorentz [1] and independently by Einstein [2] and subsequently quoted in almost
every textbook and paper on relativistic electrodynamics. Notice that, in the tensor formalism as well, according to
the ST (59), i.e., (21), the transformed components E′i
st, and B′i
st, are expressed by the mixture of components Ei
f
and Bi
f . This completely diﬀers from the correct LT (55). Both the transformations (59) and the transformations
for E′i
st. and B′i
st. (21) are typical examples of the ”apparent” transformations that are ﬁrst discussed in [24] and
[25]. The ”apparent” transformations of the spatial distances (the Lorentz contraction) and the temporal distances
(the dilatation of time) are elaborated in detail in [11,12] (see also [20]). It is explicitly shown in [12] that the true

agreement with experiments that test SR exists only when the theory deals with well-deﬁned 4D quantities, i.e., the
quantities that are invariant upon the passive LT. In all previous treatments of SR, e.g., [2–4], the transformations
for E′i
st. (21) are considered to be the LT of the 3D electric and magnetic ﬁelds. However as shown above
(the comparison of (55) and (59), or (21)) the transformations for E′i
st. are derived from the relativistically
incorrect transformations (59) and moreover the 3-vectors E′ and B′ are again formed by an incorrect procedure in
4D spacetime, i.e., by multiplying these relativistically incorrect components with the unit 3-vectors in the S′ frame.

S′ according to (59) and that the set of components tν = (1, 0, 0, 0) from S transforms to t′ν = (1, 0, 0, 0) in S′. Then
(53) transforms to the same equations but with E′µ
f and t′ν replacing tν . From the
transformed equations obtained in such a way one easily ﬁnds the ST of the ME (54). They are

The equations (61) correspond to the equation (23) in the formalism with 1-vectors Ef and Bf . They are of the same
form as the original ME (54) with primed quantities replacing the corresponding unprimed ones, but, as remarked
above, E′µ
f from S. Thence we get the same result as in the geometric algebra formalism,
i.e., that the equations (61) are not the correct LT but relativistically incorrect transformations of the original ME
(54); the LT of the ME (54) are the equations (57) with (58), where the Lorentz transformed electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, the components E′µ
f respectively, are given by the relations (55). We note that Einstein’s derivation
[2] of the ST of ﬁelds and of the ME, together with the similar derivation presented in [4], is already discussed in
detail in [11] and will not be repeated here.

D. Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations with 4-vectors Ea and Ba

In a completely similar way as in section II.D. we perform here an observer independent decomposition of F ab into
4-vectors of the electric Ea and magnetic Ba ﬁelds that are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., they are independent
of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it. (This decomposition and many results
quoted here are already presented and discussed in [11] and also in [18].) Formally all results here can be obtained
from the equations given in sections IV.A. and IV.B. replacing in them the quantities from the rest frame of ’ﬁducial’
observers, i.e., the γ0 - frame, ta, Ea
f , by the quantities deﬁned without reference frames, va, Ea and Ba,
respectively. Thus instead of (51) we have a Lorentz invariant decomposition

f and Ba

Inserting (62) into (48) we ﬁnd the Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations with 4-vectors Ea and Ba, or better to say the
ﬁeld equations (with Ea and Ba) that are deﬁned without reference frames

basis they become

(64)

(The equations from (64) correspond to (53) but with the above mentioned replacements.) It is clear from their form
that the equations (64) are invariant upon the LT. The usual ME (54) are simply obtained from (64) specifying that
vα/c = tα, i.e., choosing the rest frame of ’ﬁducial’ observers, the γ0 - frame. In a relatively moving frame S′ all
quantities in (64) will be replaced with the primed quantities, but due to their invariance upon the LT the equations
with primed quantities are exactly equal to the corresponding equations in S (given by (64)). Setting that v′α in the
transformed (64) is the LT of the components tα, i.e., v′α = (γc, βγc, 0, 0), one easily ﬁnds the Lorentz transformed
ME (57) with (58). Thus both the ME (54) and their LT (57) with (58) are obtained in a simple manner from (64).

V. DISCUSSION AND SHORT COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

16

The results obtained in this paper reveal that the usual formulation of the relativistic electrodynamics which uses
the ST of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and of the ME cannot be in agreement with experiments that test SR,
i.e., in which the observers from two frames of reference compare their measurements of the same physical quantity.
The careful analysis of the traditional experiments that test SR and their modern versions is reported in [12] and
it undoubtedly shows that the usual formulation of SR is only in an ”apparent” agreement with experiments. All
usual explanations invoke the Lorentz contraction, the dilatation of time and/or the ST of the 3D E and B. However,
as shown in [11] and [12] (see also [20]), the Lorentz contraction (the dilatation of time) refer to the comparison of
two spatial (temporal) distances in two inertial frames of reference, which means that they have nothing in common
with the LT; the LT cannot connect spatial (temporal) distances taken separately, see Figs. 3. and 4.
in [11] for
the Lorentz contraction and the dilatation of time respectively. The essential point which is illustrated by Figs. 3.
and 4.
is that, e.g., the Lorentz contracted length and the rest length do not refer to the same quantity in the 4D
spacetime. They are diﬀerent quantities in the 4D spacetime not only for diﬀerent inertial frames of reference but also
for diﬀerent synchronizations. Only the spacetime length does have a well-deﬁned physical sense in the 4D spacetime,
see Figs. 1. and 2. in [11] for the spacetime length for a moving rod and a moving clock respectively, and also the
discussion of the ”Car and garage paradox” in the second paper in [20].

The ST of the 3D E and B are often derived, e.g., in the well-known textbooks on electrodynamics [26], assuming
the existence of the Lorentz contraction of a moving charged system. This again shows in another way that the
ST are not relativistically correct transformations. The accepted existence of the Lorentz contracted length of a
moving object (in 1D case, L′ = L/γ) leads many authors, e.g., [26] and [27], to the conclusion that the charge
density of a moving system of charges (λ′) is well-deﬁned quantity in the 4D spacetime and consequently that it can
be compared with the corresponding charge density of the same system of charges when it is at rest (λ), λ′ = γλ.
Moreover the macroscopic electric charge is usually deﬁned both in the classical (e.g., [3], [27]) and quantum ﬁeld
t=const. ρd3x (in the
theories (e.g., [28]), by the integral of the charge density over the hypersurface t = const., Q =
quantum ﬁeld theories ρ = j0/c is the charge density operator). Jackson [3], for example, explicitly argues, when
discussing the invariance of electric charge that, [3] p.549, ”the charge in a small volume element d3x is ρd3x. Since
this is an experimental invariant, it is true that ρ′d3x′ = ρd3x.” Thus the Lorentz contraction is always assumed in
such conventional deﬁnition. The electric charge is an experimental invariant, but it is not correctly deﬁned by the
conventional deﬁnition. It is correctly deﬁned as a manifestly invariant quantity (a Lorentz scalar); the total electric
charge Q in a three-dimensional hypersurface H with two-dimensional boundary δH is deﬁned by the tensor equation
H jatadH, where ta is the unit normal to H. The charge-current density 4-vector ja as a coordinate-free
QδH = (1/c)
quantity is a well-deﬁned 4D quantity (ja = jµeµ) and not the charge density itself. All this is discussed in much

R

An important result was obtained in [20] (the second paper) using the invariant deﬁnition of charge, particularly
the fact that the charge density is well-deﬁned quantity in the 4D spacetime only in the rest frame of charges.
The mentioned result is that there is a second-order electric ﬁeld (∽ v2/c2, v is the drift speed of the conduction
charges) not only outside a moving loop with steady current, as usually obtained (e.g., [27]), but also outside the
same stationary loop. Of course both results refer to superconducting loops. Namely outside a normal conductor with
steady current there is always a zero-order electric ﬁeld (independent of v) together with usually considered magnetic
ﬁeld. The results from [5,6] and from this paper conﬁrm in another way the mentioned results for the loop with
steady current, since the electric ﬁeld as 4D quantity always transforms by the LT again to the electric ﬁeld. This
means that if there is an electric ﬁeld outside a moving loop with steady current than it must exist for the same but
stationary loop. Such electric ﬁeld is an experimentally veriﬁable result and has to be carefully examined. The already
performed experiments [29] cannot, contrary to their claims, measure such external electric ﬁelds (in fact, quadrupole’s
electric moment), but they can measure only the potentials from monopoles. The reason is that they used probes
directly connected with superconducting wires. The experiments in [30] are better suited for measurements of such
external electric ﬁelds from steady currents but they dealt with normal conductors and not with superconductors.
The authors of [30] forgot that always there is an external electric ﬁeld for normal current-carrying conductors. Thus
their experiment actually has nothing to do with the test of breakdown of local Lorentz invariance. However the same
type of the experiment as in [30], but with the superconducting coil, could probably detect the external second-order
electric ﬁelds. All this will be discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Let us now brieﬂy discuss, as an example, the Faraday disk, using both the conventional formulation of electrody-
namics with the 3D E and B and their ST and the formulation with geometric 4D quantities, the invariant relativistic
electrodynamics (here we shall deal only with the tensor formalism since it is better known). A conducting disk is
turning about thin axle passing through the center at a right angle to the disk and parallel to a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B. The circuit is made by connecting one end of the resistor to the axle (the spatial point A) and the other
end to a sliding contact touching the external circumference (the spatial point C). The disk of radius R is rotating
with angular velocity ω. (For the description and the picture of the Faraday disk see, e.g., [27] Chap. 18 or the recent
paper [31].) Let us determine the electromotive force (emf) in two inertial frames of reference, the laboratory frame S

in which the disk is rotating and the frame S′ instantaneously co-moving with a point on the external circumference
(say C, taken at some moment t). The x′ axis is along the velocity V of the point C at t and it is parallel to the x
axis. Actually all axes in S′ are parallel to the corresponding axes in S. The y′ axis is along the radius, i.e., along
the segment AC. First we calculate the emf using the standard formulation. In the S frame

emf =

(FL/q) · dl =

(FL,y/q)dy=ωR2B/2,

I

ZAC

where FL is the Lorentz force FL = qE+qu × B, E =0 in S, B is along the +z axis, qu × B is the magnetic part of
the Lorentz force seen by the charges co-moving with the disk along the segment AC. The integral along the segment
AC is taken at the same moment t. In the S′ frame the standard treatments suppose that the Lorentz force becomes
L = qE′+qu′ × B′, where the components of the 3D E′ and B′ are determined by the ST (59). Thus it is argued
F′
in the standard formulation that in S′ the charges experiences the ﬁelds E′ = γV βV × cB and B′ = γV B, where
βV = (V/c)i and γV = (1 − β2

V )−1/2. Then only the y′ component of the force F′

L remains and it is

F ′

L,y = −qcBβu/γV (1 − βuβV ).

Notice that the same relation can be obtained from the deﬁnition of the 4-force (the components) K µ =
(γuF · u/c, γuF) and its LT. This gives γ′
(This happens here
L,y is obtained.
L = qE′+qu′ × B′ and
L,y is calculated along the y axis and E =0 in S. Generally the expression F′
accidentally since F ′
the expression obtained from the LT of the 4-force will not give the same result.) In S′ the velocity (in units of c) β′
u
of some point on the segment AC is β′
u = γV γu(1 − βuβV ).
L,y/q over the common y, y′ axis (along the segment AC, dl′= dl) taken
The emf is again given by the integral of F ′
again at the same moment of time t (y axis is orthogonal to the relative velocity V)

u = (βu − βV )/(1 − βuβV ) and the corresponding γ′

uF ′2 = γuF 2 whence the same F ′

u is γ′

emf ′ =

(F ′

L,y/q)dy.

ZAC

It is clear from the expression for the emf in S (65) and the corresponding one for the emf in S′ (67) together with (66)
that these electromotive forces, in general, are not equal, emf 6= emf ′. Only in the limit βu, βV ≪ 1 emf ′ ≃ emf .
This result explicitly shows that the standard formulation is not relativistically correct formulation.

Let us now consider the same example in the invariant relativistic electrodynamics. In the tensor formalism the
invariant Lorentz force K a is investigated in [11] Sec. 6.1. In terms of F ab it is K a = (q/c)F abub, where ub is the
4-velocity of a charge q. In the general case of an arbitrary spacetime and when ua is diﬀerent from va (the 4-velocity
of an observer who measures Ea and Ba), i.e. when the charge and the observer have distinct world lines, K a can
⊥, and va - parallel component, K a
be written in terms of Ea and Ba as a sum of the va - orthogonal component, K a

Speaking in terms of the prerelativistic notions one can say that K a
⊥ (68) plays the role of the usual Lorentz force
lying on the 3D hypersurface orthogonal to va, while K a
k (69) is related to the work done by the ﬁeld on the charge.
However in the invariant SR only both components together, that is, K a, does have deﬁnite physical meaning and
K a deﬁnes the Lorentz force both in the theory and in experiments. Of course K a, K a
k are all 4D quantities
deﬁned without reference frames and the decomposition of K a is an observer independent decomposition. Then we
deﬁne the emf also as an invariant 4D quantity

with the {γµ} basis. Thus the components of the 4-vectors (in the Einstein system of coordinates, i.e., in the {γµ}
basis) are Eµ = (0, 0, 0, 0), Bµ = (0, 0, 0, B), uµ = (c, u = ωρ, 0, 0), dlµ = (0, 0, dl2 = dy, 0). Thence K a

chosen system of coordinates in it we shall get the same result in the relatively moving S′ frame as well;

⊥ = 0, K 2

emf =

This can be checked directly performing the LT of all 4-vectors as CBGQs from S to S′ including the transformation
of vµγµ. Obviously the approach with Lorentz invariant 4D quantities gives the relativistically correct answer in an
enough simple and transparent way.

In a like manner we could come to the same conclusion for all experiments particularly to those that test SR. For
example for the Trouton-Noble experiment [32] (see also [33]). In the experiment they looked for the turning motion
of a charged parallel plate capacitor suspended at rest in the frame of the earth in order to measure the earth’s motion
through the ether. All explanations, which are given until now (see, e.g., [34]), for the null result of the experiments
[32] ([33]) are not relativistically correct, since they use ill-deﬁned quantities in the 4D spacetime; e.g., the Lorentz
contraction, the transformation equations for the usual 3D vectors E and B and for the torque as the 3D vector, the
nonelectromagnetic forces of undeﬁned nature, etc.. Thus, for instance, in the ﬁrst paper in [34] it is claimed: ”In
particular it was seen that the potential energy of a charge distribution changes, due to Lorentz contraction of the
system, when it is set in motion.” Similarly in [34] two types of the ”explanations” of the Trouton-Noble experiment
In both types of the
are oﬀered; one of them is with nonelectromagnetic forces of undeﬁned nature, as in [34].
”explanations” the Lorentz contraction is used (d3x = γd3x) and, of course, the standard transformations of the 3D E
and B. Here, it has to be noted that often, both in the classical (e.g., [27], [34]) and quantum ﬁeld theories (e.g., [28]),
the electromagnetic energy and momentum are also deﬁned, as in the standard deﬁnition of charge, by the integrals
of the energy and momentum densities over the hypersurface t = const..It is then supposed that such hypersurface
transforms by the LT to the hypersurface t′ = const. in a relatively moving reference frame S′, and consequently
the Lorentz contraction is assumed, d3x′ = γd3x. This is relativistically incorrect since the LT cannot transform
the hypersurface t = const. in S to the hypersurface t′ = const. in a relatively moving S′. This is already examined
for the classical electrodynamics (the covariant formulation in the Einstein system of coordinates) by Rohrlich [35]
and using the component form of the electric and magnetic 4-vectors Eα and Bα (the tensor formalism) in the ﬁrst
paper in [20]. Recently [10] I have presented a Lorentz invariant formulation of the relativistic electrodynamics in the
geometric algebra formalism.That formulation is exposed exclusively in terms of the bivector ﬁeld F , thus without
using either the electric and magnetic ﬁelds or the electromagnetic potential. There [10] the most general, observer
independent, expressions for the stress-energy vector T (n) (1-vector), the energy density U (scalar), the Poynting
vector S and the momentum density g (1-vectors), the angular momentum density M (bivector) and the Lorentz
force K (1-vector) are presented and directly derived from the ﬁeld equations with F . Thus, e.g., the stress-energy
vector T (n) (which describes the ﬂow of energy-momentum through a hypersurface with unit normal n = n(x)) is
T (n) = U n + (1/c)S, where the energy density U is U = −(ε0/2)
and the Poynting vector S is
. When such invariant 4D quantities, i.e., the quantities deﬁned without reference
S = −ε0c
frames, or the CBGQs, are used in the comparison with experiments then, e.g., the explanation of the Trouton-Noble
experiment is very simple and natural. The values of such quantities are the same in the rest frame of the capacitor
and in the moving frame. Thus if there is no torque (but now as a geometric, invariant, 4D quantity) in the rest
frame then the capacitor cannot appear to be rotating in a uniformly moving frame. However we will not discuss this
problem in more detail here. It will be reported elsewhere.

We see that the general procedure in the invariant SR is the following. All considered quantities have to be
written as geometric 4D quantities, e.g., as abstract 4D tensors, or as the Cliﬀord multivectors, thus as quantities
which are deﬁned without reference frames, like in (63), (70), or (25). The physical laws expressed in terms of such
quantities automatically include the principle of relativity and there is no need to postulate it outside the mathematical
formulation of the theory. This is a fundamental diﬀerence relative to the standard formulation [2] of the theory of
relativity. Then an appropriate reference frame and a system of coordinates in it are chosen (in which the calculation
is the simplest one) and the quantities are written as CBGQs in that chosen system of coordinates. The same
result can be obtained in any other relatively moving inertial frame of reference and with any permissible system of
coordinates in it (including diﬀerent synchronizations) by performing the LT of all quantities (the form of the LT
that is independent of the chosen system of coordinates is given in [11] in the tensor formalism and in [15] in the
geometric algebra formalism). It is essential for this Lorentz invariant approach that all observers are looking at the
same 4D physical quantity. This is not the case for the traditional approaches which caused many misconceptions
and misunderstandings of the SR.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

19

The covariance of the ME is cosidered to be one of the cornerstone of the modern relativistic ﬁeld theories, both
classical and quantum. Einstein [2] derived the ST of the 3D E and B assuming that the ME with E and B must have
the same form in all relatively moving inertial frames of reference. In Einstein’s formulation of SR [2] the principle
of relativity is a fundamental postulate that is supposed to hold for all physical laws including those expressed by
3D quantities, e.g., the ME with the 3D E and B. The results presented in this paper substantially change generally
accepted opinion about the covariance of the ME exactly proving in geometric algebra and tensor formalisms that the
usual ME ((8), or (32), or (54)) change their form upon the LT (see (15) with (18), or (36) with (39), or (57) with
(58)). It is also proved that the ST of the ME (see (22) and (23), or (42) and (43), or (61)), which leave unchanged
the form of the ME, actually have nothing in common with the LT of the usual ME. The diﬀerence between the LT of
the ME, e.g., (15) with (18), and their ST, e.g., (22) and (23), is essentially the same as it is the diﬀerence between
the LT of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (see (16) and (17), or (37) and (38), or (55)) and their ST (see (19) and
(20), or (40) and (41), or (59)). This last diﬀerence is proved in detail in [5] and [6] and that proof is only brieﬂy
repeated in this paper. All this together reveals that, contrary to the generally accepted opinion, the principle of
relativity does not hold for physical laws expressed by 3D quantities (a fundamental achievement). Any 3D quantity
does not correctly transform upon the LT and thus it does not have an independent physical reality in the 4D spacetime;
in
it is not the same quantity for relatively moving observers in the 4D spacetime (see also, e.g., Figs. 3. and 4.
[11], and [12]). Since the usual ME change their form upon the LT they cannot describe in a relativistically correct
manner the experiments that test SR, i.e., the experiments in which relatively moving observers measure the same
4D physical quantity. Therefore the new ﬁeld equations with geometric 4D quantities are constructed in geometric
algebra formalism with 1-vectors E and B ((25) and (26)), and with bivectors EHL and BHL ((45) and (46), (47)),
and also in the tensor formalism with 4-vectors Ea and Ba ((63) and (64)); the Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations in
the tensor formalism are already presented in [11]. All quantities in these geometric equations are independent of
the chosen reference frame and of the chosen coordinate system in it. When the γ0 - frame with the {γµ} basis is
chosen, in which the observers who measure the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are at rest, then all mentioned geometric
equations become the usual ME. This result explicitly shows that the correspondence principle is naturally satisﬁed
in the invariant SR. However, as seen here, the description with 4D geometric quantities is correct not only in the
γ0 - frame with the {γµ} basis but in all other relatively moving frames and it holds for any permissible choice of
coordinates. We conclude from the results of this paper that geometric 4D quantities, deﬁned without reference frames
or as CBGQs, do have an independent physical reality and the relativistically correct physical laws must be expressed
in terms of such quantities. The principle of relativity is automatically satisﬁed with such quantities while in the
standard formulation of SR it is postulated outside the mathematical formulation of the theory. We see that the role
of the principle of relativity is substantially diﬀerent in the Einstein formulation of SR and in the invariant SR. The
results of this paper clearly support the latter one. Furthermore we note that all observer independent quantities
introduced here and the ﬁeld equations written in terms of them hold in the same form both in the ﬂat and curved
spacetimes. The results obtained in this paper will have important and numerous consequences in all relativistic ﬁeld
theories, classical and quantum. Some of them will be soon examined.

Abstract

The kinematics of Compton-eﬀect with violated invariance of the
velocity of light has been considered. It has been shown that in this
case faster-than-light motion of the Compton electron is possible. The
motion (if it exists in reality) begins with the energy of the incident
γ-quantum above 360 keV.

1 Introduction

The Compton scattering is a fundamental eﬀect of nuclear physics [1, 2].
The successive description of its kinematics is essential to any version of the
theory. We shall consider the kinematics of this eﬀect in connection with the
violation of invariance of the speed of light in the works where the space-time
interval takes the form [3] - [5]:

is the velocity
where t is the time; x, y, z are the space variables,
of light considered as a variable. It is seen from here that in the space with
the metric (1) the event point coordinates are the ﬁve numbers: the time
t, the space variables x, y, z, and the velocity of light c. Let us denote this
space by V 5(t, x, c). In view of the absence of the space-time variables in an
explicit form in front of the diﬀerentials dt, dx, dy, dz, the 3-space R3(x)
⊂
V 5(t, x, c) is homogeneous and isotropic, the time t is homogeneous. This is in
agreement with the basic properties of space and time in classical mechanics
[6] and Special Relativity (SR) [7] - [9]. Let us suppose that on a particle
trajectory the time has a similar property to the universal Newton time in
classical physics:

As a result the velocity of light on the particle trajectory will be depend on
the particle velocity by the law

t = t0.

mentioned publications, and the present work from the well-known theories
such as SR [7] - [9], the theory of superluminal motions with imagine mass [14]
- [19], the theory of motion with anisotropic tensor of mass [14, 19, 20], and
the versions of electrodynamics with instantaneous and retarded interactions
[21] - [23]. It is the purpose of the present work to study the kinematics of
Compton-eﬀect in space-time with the metric (1) taking into account formula
(2) and the positive velocity of light (3).

Lee algebra of Poincar´e group [24]), the algebra of commutative operators
[Qµ, Qν], [Z, Qµ], [Z, P0], [Z, Nµν ]. As a result Lorentz and Poincar´e groups
arise in the theory not only in the case the speed of light is invariant on
the hyper-plane c = c0, but also in the case the time is invariant within the

P10 involves hyperbolic rotations on the planes (x0, xi)

Let us restrict the consideration of algebra (9) on a set of functions φ =
f (x0, x, x5) and take into account Zφ = 0 in this case. The
φ(x0, x)

algebra (9) reduces to the Lee algebra of 12-dimensional group (P10, T1)X∆1,

where L6 ⊂

(the generators N0i ⊂
with t=const (the generators Qµ), T1 includes translations along the x0 axis
with c=const (the generator P0), ∆1 is the scale transformation of the x5
axis (generator Z = x5∂5). By using the Campbell-Hausdorf formula [28], it
can be shown that consecutive operations of Q0 and P0 are equivalent to the
translation along the x0 axis: t′ = eθQ0te−θQ0 = t + θ[Q0, t] + . . . = t, c′ =
eθQ0ce−θQ0 = c + θ[Q0, c] + . . . = c + θ/t, c′t′ = ct + θ;

c′t′ + φ = ct + ξ, where ξ = θ + φ, θ and φ are the group parameters. The
presence of the P0 operator corresponds to motion with time if the invariance
of the speed of light is violated. Thus, that is impossible within Minkowski
M 4
1-space on the hyper-plane c = c0 is possible within the Minkowski M 4

In spite of the fact that the action (11) is similar to the action of SR, it
diﬀers from the SR action [8]. The electrical ﬁeld has been chosen in the form

φ [8] [8]. The current density has been chosen in the form jµ = (ρ, ρu) =

(ρ, ρv/c) instead of jµ = (ρ, ρv) [8]. The current density is similar to the
expression from Pauli monograph [7] with the only diﬀerence that j in (11)
is equal to ρv/c instead of ρv/c0 [7]. Analogously, the propagation velocity
of the 4-potential in (11) is equal to c instead of c0 [8]. The action (11) goes
into the SR action, if we replace c by c0 within the corresponding expressions.
In accordance with the construction, the action (11) is Lorentz invariant and
does not depend on the x5 variable. As a result the action (11) is invariant
with respect to the group (P10, T1)X∆1, induced by the reduction of the
algebra (9) on the set of functions φ = φ(x0, x).

It is shown in [3] - [5], how a lot of experiments (interpreted only by
SR until the present time) may be explained with the help of the proposed
theory. For example, these are the experiments of Michelson and Fizeau,
aberration of light, the appearance of atmospheric µ-mesons on the Earth
surface, Doppler-eﬀect, a number of the known experiments for the proof of
independence of the speed of light from the emitter velocity, decay of unstable
particles, generation of new particles in nuclear reactions, Compton-eﬀect,
photo-eﬀect. We consider the kinematics of Compton-eﬀect in more detail.

tial. As a result x0 possess property of the time for M 4
2-Minkowski space.
Therefore, by virtue of Lagrange mechanical equations, the momentum and
energy (15) for an isolated system are the integrals of motion because of the
homogeneity of space-time [6, 8]. The formula for the kinetic energy takes
the form

vation law for Compton-eﬀect

for the momentum p′ and energy

momentum of the incident γ-quantum is directed along the α x-axis, θ is the
scattering angle of γ′-quantum, α is the scattering angle of electron e′. The
angle θ is counted counterclockwise; the angle α is counted clockwise. Let us

of the laws of conservation (29) and the dispersion relationship (17), these
are common to both the Minkowski spaces. The distinctions arise when the
transformational properties of the time ”t” for the M 4

taken into account in calculating the velocities of the scattered γ′-quantum
and Compton electron. By using formula (34), we ﬁnd that in the M 4

According to (39), faster-than-light motion of the forward-scattered electron

Thus, it follows from the kinematics of Compton-eﬀect that in scatter-
ing the γ-quantum in the M 4
2-Minkowski space, the appearance of electron
faster-than-light motion is possible. This motion begins from the γ-quantum
energy exceeding 360 keV. For going to SR, the following relations may be

The relations (41) correspond to the equality of the scattered electron energy

To calculate the scattered γ′-quantum velocity in the M 4

2-space, the use
of the energy-momentum conservation law is scarce. Certain assumptions of
the nature of scattering are necessary.

8 Turning to equations of quantum theory

Let us make clear how the basic equations of quantum theory (Schr¨odinger,
Klein-Gordon-Fock and Dirac equations) may be written in the M 4
2-space.
For this purpose we shall use the standard approach and pass on to the
operator form for energy and momentum in the line 6 of Table 1 accordingly
to the rule:

E →

Here the operator for energy takes the well-known form [2], if c = c0. The op-
erator for momentum is standard [2]. Then for the free motion of a quantum
particle we have the following equations.

9 Discussion and conclusion

·

1010 cm/s to

It has been considered the version of a mathematical theory that is similar to
SR but diﬀers from it in view of its being based on the metric of more general
form (1). Here the velocity of light run through the continuous spectrum of
values from c0 = 3
. It is believed from formally mathematical
standpoint that the space with such a metric is 5-dimensional. It contains
two Minkowski space: the ﬁrst space M 4
1 on the hyper-plane c0 with the
local time x0 = c0t, where SR is realized, and the second space M 4
2 with
t
the non-local time x0 =
0 cdτ , where realized is the theoretical version from
the present work and the publications [3] - [5]. Some like ideas are contained
R
in the well-known monograph of Pauli [7]. On the page 29 in discussing the
Michelson experiment, Pauli notes that according to Abraham the velocity
of light in frame K ′ moving together with the interferometer is equal

c′ = c

β2.

p

(51)

This diﬀers from the velocity of light c in laboratory frame K 2. According to
Abraham the time dilatation is absent. The Abraham’s viewpoint conforms
to the result of Michelson experiment but contradicts the relativity principle
because it leaves room for absolute motion [7].

·

′ = 3

1 and M 4

It is interesting to note that if we ﬁnd c from Abraham’s formula and
postulate c′ = c0
1010 sm/s, we just obtain the relations (2) and (3) of
the present work that is in agreement with the principle of relativity. Thus,
the Abraham’s point of view turned out to be associated in an indirect way
with the Finsler space (1) and with the presence of the two Minkowski spaces
M 4
2 in it. This is the simplest example of turning to spaces of
such a type. However this simplicity makes deep sense as it is conditioned by
fundamental properties of 3-space and time such as isotropy and homogeneity.
The more complicated examples of non-homogeneous space-time with the
metric ds2 = c−2N
, where N
, j = 1, 2, 3, are considered in [27, 31, 32]. This
c
is the number,
|
|
metric enables one to introduce three Minkowski spaces: on the hyper-plane
1−N t, on the vectors (x0 = c1−N t, xj =
c = c0=const with the time x0 = c0
(c−N x, c−N y, c−N z)) with the time x0 = c1−N t, and on the hyper-plane
t = t0=const with x0 = c1−N t0.
In the last case the role of time as a
scalar parameter will play the velocity of light c. Motions in this space will
happen beyond the conventional conception of time. At present it is not clear
what the possibility of existing additional Minkowski spaces means, as well
as whether this possibility has to do with the physical reality. It is a subject
for further investigations.

In sum, we have shown that in the M 4

2-space it is possible to construct
the theory, which admits faster-than-light motions of electromagnetic ﬁelds
and particles with real masses. As a subgroup of symmetry, it contains
the Poincar´e group. Unlike motions described by SR in M 4
2-
space it is possible to introduce the time similar to the universal Newton
time on the trajectory of a particle. The particle mass does not depend
on the velocity of its motion and is the fundamental constant as in classical
mechanics. According to the Compton-eﬀect kinematics in the M 4
2-space the
1010 cm/s, if the incident γ-
scattered electron will move faster than c0 = 3
quantum energy exceeds 360 keV. For example, in the case of the annihilation
quantum with the energy 511 keV (N a22) and the propagation velocity c = c0
the forward-scattered electron will be moving with the velocity 0.8c0 in the
M 4
2-space. This distinction (if it exists really)
may be experimentally detected by means of measuring the ﬂight-time of the

Abstract
Abstract: We introduce a dual lifting of uniﬁed gauge theories, the
ﬁrst characterized by the isotopies, which are axiom- preserving maps
into broader structure with positive-deﬁnite generalized units used
for the representation of matter under the isotopies of the Poincare’
symmetry, and the second characterized by the isodualities, which are
anti-isomorphic maps with negative-deﬁnite generalized units used for
the representation of antimatter under the isodualities of the Poim-
care’ symmetry. We then submit, apparently for the ﬁrst time, a novel
grand uniﬁcation with the inclusion of gravity for matter embedded in
the generalized positive-deﬁnite units of uniﬁed gauge theories while
gravity for antimatter is embedded in the isodual isounit. We then
show that the proposed grand uniﬁcation provides realistic possibili-
ties for a resolution of the axiomatuic incompatibilities between gravi-
itation and electroweak interactions due to curvature, antimatter and
the fundamental space-time symmetries.

1. Introduction
In this note we study the structural incompatibilities for an axiomatically
consistent inclusion of gravitation (1) in the uniﬁed gauge theories of elec-
troweak interactions(2) due to:

(1) Curvature. In fact, electroweak theories are essentially structured
on Minkowskian axioms, while gravitational theories are formulated via Rie-
mannian axioms, a disparity which is magniﬁed at the operator level because

1

of known technical diﬃculties of quantum gravit(3), e.g., to provide a PCT
theorem comparable to tyhat of electroweak interactions.

(2) Antimatter. In fact, electroweak theories are bona ﬁde relativistic
theories, thus characterizing antimatter via negative-energy solutions, while
gravitation characterizes antimatter via positive-deﬁnite energy-momentum
tensors.

(3) Fundamental space-time symmetries. In fact, the electroweak
interactions are based on the axioms of the special relativity, thus verifying
the fundamental Poincare’ symmetry P (3.1), while such a basic symmetry is
absent in contemporary gravitation.

We present, apparently for the ﬁrst time, a conceivable resolution of the
above structural incompatibilities via the use of the following new methods:
(A) Isotopies. A baﬄing aspect in the inclusion of gravity in uniﬁed
gauge theories is their apparent geometric incompatibility despite their indi-
vidual beauty and experimental veriﬁcations.

The view we would like to convey is that the above structural incompati-
bility is not necessarily due to insuﬃciencies in Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, but
rather to insuﬃciencies in their mathematical treatment. Stated in plain lan-
guage, we believe that the achievement of axiomatic compatibility between
gravitation and electroweak interactions requires a basically new mathemat-
ics, that is, basically new numbers, new spaces, etc.

In the hope of resolving in due time this second structural incompatibility,
Santilli(4a) proposed back in 1978 when at the Department of Mathematics
of Harvard University under DOE support, a new mathematics based on
the so-called isotopies, and today known as isomathematics, which was then
studied in numerous works(4−11) (see in particular the latest memoir(4e)).

The isotopies are nowadays referred to maps (also called liftings) of any
’given linear, local and canonical or unitary theory into its most general possi-
ble nonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical or nonunitary extensions, which are
nevertheless capable of reconstructing linearity, locality and canonicity or uni-
tarity on certain generalized spaces and ﬁelds, called isospaces and isoﬁelds.
From their Greek meaning, isotopies are therefore ”axiom-preserving”.

The fundamental isotopy of this note is that of the 4-dimensional unit I of
the Minkowskian and Riemannian space-times into a 4x4-dimensional, every-
where invertible, Hermitean and positive-deﬁnite matrix ˆI whose elements
have an arbitrary functional dependence on the local space-time coordinates
x, as well as any other needed variable,

I = Diag.(1, 1, 1, 1) → ˆI(x, ...) = ( ˆI µ

ν (x, ...)) = ˆI † = [ ˆT (x, ...)]−1 > 0,

(1)

with corresponding lifting of the conventional associative product

A × B → A ˆ×B = A × ˆT × B,

(2)

under which ˆI(x, ...) = [ ˆT (x, ...)]

−1

is the correct left and right unit of the

2

the new theory called isounit, in which case ˆT (x, ...) is called the isotopic
element.

When applicable, liftings (1) and (2) require for consistency the recon-
struction of all mathematical methods of contemporary physics, with no ex-
ception known to this author. In fact, they require new numbers and ﬁelds
called isonumbers and isoﬁelds with an arbitrary (positive-deﬁnite) unit, new
spaces over isoﬁelds called isospaces, the new isodiﬀerenmtial calculus, the
new isoeuclidean, isominkowskian and isosymplectic geometries, etc. which
we cannot possibly review in this note and must assume as known (see their
latest formulation in memoir(4e)).

In a commnunication at the VII Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General
Relativity held in 1994 at Stanford University, Santilli(5a) showed that the iso-
mathematics permits a novel classical and operator treatment of gravitation
which, on one side, preserves Riemannian metrics, Einstein’s ﬁeld equations
and related experimental veriﬁcations while, on the other side, veriﬁes the
abstract Minkowskian axioms.

The above reformulation is evidently fundamental for this note, inasmuch
as it oﬀers realistic possibilities of resolving the structural incompatibility
between electroweak and gravitational interactions due to curvature, by re-
ducing the latter to the axiomatic structure of the former for the case of
matter only (see below for antimatter).

The main mechanism is that ﬁrst presented at mg7 (Ref.(5a), p. 501)
which is based on the factorization of any given Riemannian metric (e.g.,
Schwardzschild metric(1c)) g(x) into the Minkowski metric η(+1, +1, +1, −1)

g(x) = T (x) × η,

(3)

(4)

where the gravitational isotopic element T (x) is evidently a 4-dimensional
matrix which is always positive-deﬁnite from the locally Minkowskian char-
acter of Riemann. The entire theory must then be reconstructed with respect
to the gravitational isounit

ˆI = [ ˆT (x)]−1 = η × [g(x)]−1 > 0,

Note that the component truly representing curvature in the Riemannian
geometry is not the Riemannian metric g(x) but rather its isotopic compo-
nent T(x), trivially, because the remaining component η is ﬂat. It is then
easy to see that the isotopic treatment of gravity formally eliminates curva-
ture, thus rendering gravitation axiomatically compatible with the electroweak
interactions. In fact, curvature exists when the gravitational isotopic element
T(x) is referred to the conventional space-time unit I, while curvature for-
mally disappears when T (x) is referred to a generalized unit which is its
inverse [T (x)]−1.

Reformulations (3) and (4) also imply the birth of a novel geometry,
the isominkowskian geometry, ﬁrst submitted by Santilli(6a) in 1983 which,
in more recent studies(5e) has resulted to be a symbiotic uniﬁcation of the

3

Minkowskian and Riemannian geometries, because it veriﬁes all the abstract
axioms of the former, while preserving the machinery of the latter (covariant
derivatives, connections, etc.). The formulation of gravity based on Eq.s (3)
and (4) is then called isominkowskian gravity.

Allow us to stress for clarity that we are here referring to a mere math-
ematical reformulation of Einstein’s historical ﬁeld equations on the math-
ematical isominkowskian spaces (i.e., refer them to a new unit ˆI) because
the projection of the treatment into the conventional space-tine (i.e., when
referred to the conventional space-time unit I) recovers said historical equa-
tions in their totality. The above occurrences therefore oﬀer realistic hopes
of resolving the baﬄing occurrence indicated earlier, i.e., the apparent in-
compatibility between Einstein’s majectic conception of gravitation with the
geometric structure of electroweak interactions.

The reader should be aware that the proposed resolution works best where
it is needed most, at the operator level. In fact, Santilli(5a) showed at mg7
that the operator formulation of the isominkowskian representation of grav-
ity veriﬁes all abstract axioms and physical laws of conventional ”relativistic”
quantum mechanics (RQM). The emerging new theory is called operator iso-
gravity (OIG) and merely consists in embedding gravity in the unit of RQM.
The reader should be aware that the above classical and operator iso-
topies are supported by two, hitherto unknown symmetries, ﬁrst presented
in memoir(4f ) under the tentative name of isoselfscalar symmetries, which
are characterized by the transforms

η → ˆη = n−2 × η, I → ˆI = n2 × I,

where n is a parameter, and yield the symmetry of the conventional Minkowskian
interval remains

x2 = (xµ × ηµν × xν) × I = (xµ × ˆηµν × xν) × ˆI = xˆ2,

with a corresponding invariance for the Hilbert space

(5)

(6)

< φ| × |ψ > ×I =< φ| × n−2 × |ψ > ×(n2 × I) =< φ| ˆ×|ψ > × ˆI.

(7)

The isominkowskian representation of gravity then emerges from the
above classical and quantum symmetries via the axiom-preserving addition of
an x-dependence in the n-parameter, much along the transition from Abelian
to non-Abelian gauge theories.

(B) Isodualities. Structural incompatibility (2) is only the symptom
of deeper problems in the contemporary treatment of antimatter. To be-
gin, matter is treated nowadays at all levels, from Newtonian to electroweak
interactions, while antimatter is treated only at the level of second quanti-
zation. Since there are serious indications that half of the universe could
well be made up of antimatter, it is evident that a more eﬀective theory of
antimatter must also apply at all levels.

4

At any rate, recall that charge conjugation in quantum mechanics is an
anti-automorphic map. As a result, no classical theory of antimatter can be
axiomatically consistent via the mere change of the sign of the charge, because
it must be an anti-authomorphic (or, more generally, anti-isomorphic image
of that of matter.

The current dramatic disparity in the treatment of matter and antimatter
also has its predictable problematic aspects. Since we currently use only one
type of quantization (whether naive of symplectic), it is easy to see that
the operator images of the contemporary treatment of antimatter is not the
correct charge conjugate state, but merely a conventional state of particles
with a reversed sign of the charge.

The view here submitted is that, as it is the case for curvature, the resolu-
tion of the above general shortcomings, including the achievement of compat-
ibility in the treatment of antimatter between electroweak and gravitational
interactions, require a basically novel mathematics.

Santilli therefore entered into a second search for another novel math-
ematics under the uncompromissble condition of being an anti-isomorphic
image of the preceding isomathematics. After inspecting a number of alter-
natives, this author(6c) submitted in 1985 the following map of an arbitrary
quantity Q (i.e., a number, or a vector ﬁeld or an operator) under the tenta-
tive name of isoduality

Q → Qd = −Q†.

(8)

When applied to the totality of the quantities and their operations, map
(8) yields an anti-isomorphic image of that of matter, as axiomatically needed
for consistency. Moreover, while charge conjugation is solely applicable
within operator settings, isodualy (8) is applicable at all levels of study,
beginning with the mathematical foundations.

It is evident that map (8) implies a new mathematics, that with negative
units called isodual mathematics(7), which includes new numbers, new spaces,
new calculus, etc.
In reality we have two diﬀerent isodual mathematics,
the ﬁrst is the anti-isomorphic image of the conventional mathematics used
for matter, and the second is the anti-isomorphic image of the preceding
isomathematics.

The above characteristics have permitted the construction of the novel
isodual theory of antimatter(7) which is equivalent, although anti-isomorphic,
to that of matter, and which therefore begins at the primitive Newtonian
level and then continues at the analytic and quantum levels, in which case it
results to be equivalent to charge conjugation.

Most importantly, the isodual theory of antimatter has resulted to be
in agreement with all available classical and quantum experimental data on
antimatter.

It is evident that isodualities oﬀer a realistic possibility of resolving the
second structural problem between electroweak and gravitational interactions
because antimatter can be treated in both cases with negative-energy. This

5

is due to the fact that isodualities imply the transition from the conventional
space-time units of matter I = Diag.(1, 1, 1, 1) > 0 to their negative image
I d = −I < 0. As a result, all characteristics of matter change sign in the
transition to antimatter under isoduality, thus yielding the correct conjuga-
tion of charge, as well as negative energy, negative energy-momentum tensor,
and, inevitably, negative time. The historical objections against these nega-
tive values are inapplicable, because they are tacitly referred to the conven-
tional positive units. In fact, negative energy and time referred to negative
units are fully equivalent, although antiautomorphic, to the conventional
positive energy and time referred to positive units.

The reader should also be aware that the isodual theory of antimatter

was born from properties of the conventinal Dirac equation

γµ × [pµ − e × Aµ(x)/c] + i× × Ψ(x) = 0,

γk =

(9a)

(9b)

(9c)

In fact, as one can see, the negative unit I d

s = Diag.(−1, −1) appears in
the very structure of γ4. The isodual theory was then constructed precisely
around Dirac’s unit I d
s

In essence, Dirac assumed that the negative-energy solutions of his his-
torical equation behaved in an unphysical way because tacitly referred to
the conventional mathematics of his time, that with positive units Is > 0.
Santilli(7) showed that, when the same negative-energy solutions are referred
to the negative units I d
s < 0, they behaved in a fully physical way. This
eliminates the need of second quantization for the treatment of antiparticles
(as expected in a theory of antimatter beginning at the Newtonian level),
and permitts the reformulation of the equation in the form (9)

˜γµ × [pµ − e × A(x)/c] + i × m × ˜Ψ(x) = 0,

where Φ(x) is now two-dimensional, which is fully symmetrized between par-
ticles and antiparticles.

As it was the case for the preceding isotopies, the isodual theory of an-
timatter also sees its solid roots in two additional novel symmetries, also

6

unknown until recently, and ﬁrst presented in memoir(4f ), the ﬁrst holding
for the conventional Minkowski interval

x2 = (xµ×ηµν ×xν)×I = [xµ×(−n−2×ηµν)×xν]×(−n2×I) = (xµ×ˆηd

µν ×xν)× ˆI d = xd2d,

(11)

and the second holding for the Hilbert space

< φ| × |ψ > ×I =< φ| × (−n−2) × |ψ > ×(−n2 × I) =< φ| × ˆT d × |ψ > × ˆI d,
(12)
which ensure that all physical laws for matter also holds for antiparticles un-
der our isodual representation, with corresponding symmetries for the isodual
expressions.

The aciom-preserving lifting of the n-parameter to an explicit x-dependedence

then yields the isodual isomimkowskian treatment of gravity for antimatter
with basic structures,

g(x) = ˆT (x) × η → gd(x) = −g(x) = ˆT d(x) ×d ηd, η → ηd = −η,

(13a)

ˆI(x) = [ ˆT (x)]−1 → ˆI d(x) = [ ˆT d(x)]−1.

(13b)

As we shall see in the next section rules (3)-(4) and (13) can indeed be

implemented within uniﬁed gauge theories

(C) Isotopies of the Poincare’ symmetry and their isoduals.
Judging from the studies herein reported, the most severe problems of com-
patibility between gravitation and electroweak interactions for both matter
and antimatter appeared precisely were expected, in the fundamental space-
time symmetries, because of the disparity indicatd earlier of the validity of
the Poincare’ symmetry for electroweak interactions and its absence for grav-
itation.

The latter problems called for a third series of studies presented in Ref.s(6)
on the isotopies and isodualities of the Poincare’ symmetry ˆP (3.1), today
called the Poincare’-Santilli isosymmetry and its isodual(8 − 10), which in-
clude the isotopies and isodualities of: the rotational symmetrt(6c); the Lorentz
symmetry in classical(6a) and operrator version(6b); the SU(2)-spin symmetry(6d);
the Poincare’ Symmetry(6e);, and the spinorial covering of the Poincare’
symmetry(6f ) (see monographs(5g) for comprehensive studies).

We are here referring to the reconstruction of the conventional symmetries
with respect to an arbitrary positive-deﬁnite unit (1), for the isodoties, and
an arbitrary negative-deﬁnite unit for the isodualities. This reconstruction
yields the most general known nonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical liftings
of conventional symmetries, while being locally isomorphic (for isotopies) or
anti-isomorphic (for isodualities) to the original symmetries.

7

One should be aware that the above structures required the prior step-by-
step isotopies and isodualities Lie’s theory (enveloping associative algebras,
Lie algebras, Lie groups, transformation and representation theories, etc.),
originally proposed by Santilli(4a) in 1978, studied in numerous subsequent
works (see monographs(4c,6g)) and today called the Lie-Santilli isotheory and
its isodual(8−10).

It is evident that the isopoincare’ symmetry and its isodual have fun-
damental character for this note. In fact, one of their primary applications
has been the achievement of the universal symmetry of all possible Rieman-
nian line elements in their isominkowskian representation(6). Once the unit
of gauge theories is lifted to represent gravitation, electroweak interactions
will also obey the isopoincare’ symmetry for matter and its isodual for an-
timatter, thus oﬀering realistic hopes for the resolution of the most diﬃcult
problem of compatibility, that for space-time symmetries.

Perhaps unexpectedly, the fundamental space-time symmetry of the grand
uniﬁed theory inclusive of gravitation submitted in this note is the total sym-
metry of the conventional Dirac equation, here written with their underlying
spaces and units

ST ot = {SL(2.C) × T (3.1)} × {SLd(2.C d) ×d T d(3.1)},

(14a)

MT ot = {M(x, η, R) × Sspin} × {M d(xd, ηd, Rd) ×d Sd

spin},

(14b)

IT ot = {Iorb × Ispin} × {I d

orb ×d I d

spin},

(14c)

which has recently emerged as being the twenty-two dimensional.

To see the above occurrence, the reader should be aware that isodual-
ities imply yet another new symmetry called isoselfduality7), which is the
invariance under the isodual map (8). Dirac’s gamma matrices verify in-
deed this new symmetry (from which the symmetry itself was derived in the
ﬁrst place), i.e., γµ → γd
µ = γµ. As a result, contrary to a popular
belief throughout this century, the Poincare’ symmetry cannot be the total
symmetry of Dirac’s equations, evidently because it is not isoselfdual. For
evident reasons of consistency, the total symmetry of Eq.s (sds) must also be
isoselfdual as the gamma-matrices are. This resulted in the identiﬁcation of
the total symmetry (sdsda) which is indeed isoselfdual.

µ = −γ†

To understand the dimensionality of symmetry one must ﬁrst recall that
isodual spaces are indepednent form conventional spaces. The doubling of the
conventional dimensionality then yields twenty dimensions. The additional
two dimensions are given by the novel isoselfscalarity, i.e., invariance (6)-(7)
and their isoduals (11)-12).

In short, the grand uniﬁcation proposed in this note is based on the
axiomatic structure of the conventional Diurac’s equyations, as emerged from
the novel insights of memooir(4f ), and merely subjected to axiom-preserving

8

liftings, in which the inclusion of gravitation for matter is permitted by the
novel isoselfscalar symmetries (6)-(7), and that for antimater by the anti-
isomorphic images (11)-(12).

The reader should not be surprised that the four new invariances (sdsd)-
(sdsds) remained undetected throughout this century. In fact, their identiﬁ-
cation required the prior discovery of new numbers, ﬁrst the numbers with
negative unit for invariances (6)-(7), and then the additional new numbers
with arbitrary negative units for invariances (11)-(12x).

2. Isotopic Gauge Theory

The isotopies of gauge theories were ﬁrst studied in 1980’s by Gasperini
(11a), followed by Nishioka(10b), Karajannis and Jannussis(11c) and others, and
then ignored thereafter. These studies were deﬁned on conventional spaces
over conventional ﬁelds and via the conventional diﬀerential calculus. As
such, they are not invariant, as we learned only recently in memoirs(4f ).

In this section we shall introduce, apparently for the ﬁrst time, the iso-
topies of gauge theories, or isogauge theories for short, formulated in an in-
variant way, that is, on isospaces over isoﬁelds and characterized by the isod-
iﬀerential calculus of memoir R. The isodual isogauge theories are apparently
introduced in this note for the ﬁrst time.

The essential mathematical methods needed for an axiomatically consis-

tent and invariant formulation of the isogauge theories are the following:

(1) Isoﬁelds(4e) of isoreal numbers ˆR(ˆn, ˆ+, ˆ×) and isocomplex numbers
ˆC(ˆc, ˆ+, ˆ×) with: additive isounit ˆ0 = 0; generalized multiplicative isounit
ˆI given by Eq.
(1); elements, isosum, isoproduct and related generalized
operations,

ˆa = a × ˆI, a = n, c, ˆa ˆ+ˆb = (a + b) × ˆI, ˆa ˆ×ˆb = ˆa × ˆT × ˆb = (a × b) × ˆI, (15a)

ˆaˆn = ˆa ˆ×ˆa ˆ×... ˆ×ˆa, ˆa

ˆ1/2 = a1/2 × ˆI 1/2, ˆaˆ/ˆb = (ˆa/ˆb) × ˆI, etc.

(15b)
(2) Isominkowski spaces(6a) ˆM = ˆM (ˆx, ˆη, ˆR) with isocoordinates ˆx =
x × ˆI = {xµ} × ˆI, isometric ˆN = ˆη × ˆI = ˆT (x, . . .) × η × ˆI, and isointerval
over the isoreals ˆR

(ˆx − ˆy)ˆ2 = [(ˆx − ˆyµ ˆ× ˆNµν ˆ×(ˆx − ˆy)ν = [(x − y)µ × ˆηµν(x − y)ν] × ˆI,

(16)

equiped with Kadeisvili isocontinuity(10a) and Tsagas-Sourlas isotopology(10b).
(3) Isodiﬀerential calculus(4e) characterized by the following isodiﬀer-

entials and isoderivatives

ˆdˆxµ = ˆI µ

ν × dˆxν, ˆdˆxµ = ˆT ν

µ × ˆxν, ˆ∂µ ˆf = ˆ∂ ˆf ˆ/ ˆ∂ ˆxµ = ( ˆT ν

µ × ∂νf ) × ˆI,

(17a)

ˆ∂µ ˆf = ( ˆI µ

ν × ∂νf ) × ˆI, ˆ∂ ˆxµˆ/ ˆ∂ ˆxν = ˆδµ

ν = δµ

ν × ˆI, etc.

(17b)

(4) Isofunctional isoanalysis(5g), including the reconstruction of all
conventiuonal and special functions and transforms into a form admitting of
ˆI as the left and right unit. Since the isominkowskian geometry preserves
the Minkowskian axioms, it allows the preservation of the notions of straght
and intersecting lines, thus permitting the reconstruction of trigonometric
and hyperbolic functions under the Riemannian metric g(x) = ˆη(5g).

(5) Isominkowskian geometry(5e), i.e., the geometry of isomanifolds
ˆM over the isoreals ˆR, which satisﬁes all abstract Minkowskian axioms be-
cause of the joint liftings η → ˆη = T (x, ...) × η and I → ˆI = T −1, while
preserving the machinery of Riemannian spaces (covariant derivatives, con-
nections, etc.), although expressed in terms of the isodiﬀerential calculus for
consistency. In this new geometry Riemannian line elements are turned into
identical Minkowskian forms via the embedding of gravity in the diferentials,
e.g., for the Schwarzschild exterior metric we have (Ref.[5e], Eq.s (2.57),
where the space-time coordinates are assumed to be covariant,

ˆdˆs = ˆdˆrˆ2 ˆ+ˆrˆ2 ˆ×( ˆdˆθˆ2 ˆ+isosinˆ2 ˆθ) ˆ− ˆdˆtˆ2,

(18a)

ˆdˆr = ˆTr × dˆr, ˆdˆt = ˆTt × dˆt, ˆTr = (1 − 2 × M/r)−1, ˆTt = 1 − 2 × M/r. (18b)

(6) Relativistic hadronic mechanics(4f ) charcterized by the isohilbert
space ˆH ﬁrst introduced by Myung and Santilli(9e) in 1982 with isoinner
product and isonormalization over ˆC

< ˆφˆ| ˆψ >=< ˆφ| ˆ×| ˆψ > × ˆI, < ˆψˆ| ˆψ >= ˆI.

(19)

Among the various properties we recall recall that: the isohermiticity
on ˆH concides with the conventional Hemricitity (thus, all conventional
observables remain observables under isotopies); the isoeigenvalues of iso-
hermitean operators are reals and conventional (because of the identities
ˆH ˆ×| ˆψ >= ˆE ˆ×| ˆψ >= E × | ˆψ >); the condition of isounitarity on ˆH over ˆC
is given by ˆU ˆ× ˆU † = ˆU † ˆ× ˆU = ˆI (see memoir(4f ) for details).

(7) The Lie-Santilli isotheory(4,6,8d,10c) with: conventional (ordered)
basis of generators X = (Xk), and parameters w = (wk) k = 1, 2, ..., n, only
formulated in isospaces over isoﬁelds with a common isounit; universal en-
veloping isoasociative algebras ˆξ with inﬁnite-dimensional basis characterized
by the isotopic Poincare’-Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem

ˆI, ˆXi ˆ× ˆXj, (i ≤ j), ˆXi ˆ× ˆXj × ˆXk, (i ≤ j ≤ k; , ...

Lie-Santilli isoalgebras

[ ˆXiˆ, ˆXj] = ˆXi ˆ× ˆXj − ˆXj ˆ× ˆXi = ˆC k

ij(x, ...) ˆ× ˆXk;

where the ˆC’s are the structure isofunctions; and isogroups characterized by
isoexponentiation on ˆξ with structure

(20)

(21)

10

ˆe ˆX = ˆI ˆ+ ˆXˆ/ˆ1ˆ! ˆ+ ˆX ˆ× ˆXˆ/ˆ2ˆ! ˆ+... = (e ˆX× ˆT ) × ˆI = ˆI × (e ˆT × ˆX),

(22)

Despite the isomorhisms of the isotopic and conventional structures, the
lifting of Lie’s theory is nontrivial because of the apperance of the matrix
ˆT with nonlinear elements in the very exponent of the group structure, Eq.s
(22). To avoid misrepresentations, one must therefore keep in mind that
the isotopies of Lie’s theory were not proposed to build ”new algebras” (an
impossible task since all Lie algebras are known from Cartan’s classiﬁcation),
but to construct instead the most general possible nonlinear, nonlocal and
noncanonical or nonunitary ”realizations” of known Lie algebras.

Another important aspect the reader should keep in mind is that the
isotopies are such to reconstruct linearity, locality and canonicity or unitarity
on isospaces over isoﬁelds, called isolinearity, isolocality and isocanonicity or
isounitarity. As a result, the use of the conventional linear transformations
on M over R, X ′ = A(a) × x violates isolinearity on ˆM over ˆR. In general,
any use of conventional mathemnatics for isotopic theories leads to a number
of inconsistencies which generally remain undetected by nonexperts in the
ﬁeld.

We are now minimally equipped to introduce the desired isogauge the-
ory which can be characterized by an an n-dimensional connected and non-
abelian isosymmetry ˆG with: basic n-dimensional isounit (1); isohermitean
operators ˆX on an isohilbert space ˆH over the isoﬁeld ˆC(ˆc, ˆ+, ˆ×); universal

The isodualisogaugetheory is the image of the preceding theory follow-
ing the application of the isodual map (8) to the totality of the quantities
and all their operations. The latter theory is characterized by the isodual
isogroup ˆGd with isodual isounit ˆI d = − ˆI † = − ˆI. The base ﬁelds are the ﬁeld
d
ˆRd(ˆnd, ˆ+d, ˆ×
) of isodual isoreal numbers ˆnd = −ˆn = −n × ˆI and the ﬁeld
ˆC d(ˆcd, ˆ+d, ˆ×d) of 0isodual isocomplex numbers ˆcd = −ˆa† = (n1−i×n2)× ˆI d =
(−n1 + i × n2) ˆI.

The carrier spaces are the isodual isominkowski space ˆM d(ˆxd, ˆηd, ˆRd)
on ˆRd and the isodual isohilbert space Hd on ˆC d with isodual isostates
| ˆψ >d= −| ˆψ >† and isodual isoinner product < ˆφ|d × ˆT d × | ˆψ >d × ˆI d. It
is instructive to verify that all eigenvalues of isodual isohermitean operators
are negative − deﬁnite (when projected in our space-time), ˆH d ˆ×d| ˆψ >d=
(−E) ˆ×| ˆψ >.

ˆGd is characterized by vthe isodual Lie-Santilli isotheory with isodual
generators ˆX d = − ˆX, isodual isoassociative product ˆAd ˆ×d ˆB = ˆAd × ˆT d ×
ˆBd, ˆT d = − ˆT and related isodual isoenveloping and Lie-Santilli isoalgebra.
The elements of ˆGd are the isodual isounitary isooperators ˆU d(ˆθd(ˆxd)) =
− ˆU (−ˆθ(−ˆx)). In this way, the isodual isogauge theory results to be an anti-
isomorphic image of the preceding theory, as desired.

It is an instructive exercise for the reader interested in learning the new
techniques to study ﬁrst the isodualities of the conventional gauge theory
(rather than of their isotopies), and show that they essentially provide a
mere-reninterpretation of the usually discatred, advanced solutions as char-
acterizing antiparticles. Therefore, in the isoselfdual theory with total gauge

12

symmetry ˆG × ˆGd, isotopic retarded solutions are associated to particles and
advanced isodual solutions are associated to antiparticles.

It is also recommended to the interested reader to verify that the isotopies
are indeed equivalent to charge conjugation for all massive particles, with the
exception of the photon. In fact, isodual theories predict that the antihydro-
gen atom(11b) emits a new photon, tentatively alled by this author the isodual
photon, which coincides with the conventional photon for all possible inter-
actions, thus including electroweak interactions, except gravitation(7c). This
indicates that the isodual map is inclusive of charge conjugation for masive
particles, but it broder than the latter.

Isodual theories in general, thus inclusing the proposed grand uniﬁcation,
also predict that all stable isodual particles, including the isodual photon, the
isodual electron (positron), the isodual proton (antiproton) and their bound
states, experience antigravity in the ﬁeld of Earth (deﬁned as the reversal of
the sign of the curvature tensor). If conﬁrmed, the prediction may oﬀer the
possibility in the future to ascertain whether far away galaxies and quasars
are made-up of matter or of antimatter

Known objections against antigravity are inapplicable because they are
tacitly referred to positive units and also because the isodual theory predicts
that particle-antiparticle bound states such as the positronium, experience
attraction in both ﬁelds of matter and antimatter(7). The latter predictions
are currently under experiemntal study(11).

We also note that the isotopies leave unrestricted the functional depen-
dence of the isounit (1), provided that it is positive-deﬁnite.
In this note
we use only the x-dependence to represent exterior gravitational problems in
vacuum. The isotheory also admits an arbitrary nonlinearity in the veloci-
ties and other variables which is used for the study of interior gravitational
problems. The isotheory naturally admits a dependence of the isounit on the
wavefunctions and their derivatives while preserving isolinearity in isospace
(thus preserving the superposition principle, as needed for a consistent rep-
resentation of composite systems). For these and other aspects we refef the
reader to memoir(4f ).

We ﬁnally note that isomathematics is a particular cases of the broader
genomathematics(4a,4e,4f ), which occurs for non-Hermitean generalized units
and is used for an axiomatization of irreversibility. In turn, the genomathe-
matics is a particular case of the hypemathematics(4e,4f ), which occurs when
the generalized units are given by ordered sets of non-Hermitean quantities
and is used for the representation of mumtivalued complex systems (e.g.,
biological) in irreversible conditions. Evidently both the genomathematics
and hypermathematics admit an anti-isomorphic image under isoduality (an
outline of these novel mathematics can be found in Page 18 of Web Site(9y)).
In conclusion the methods outlined in this note permit the study of seven
liftings of conventional gauge theories; (1) the isodual gauge theories for the
treatment of antimatter without gravitation in vacuum; (2,3), the isogauge
theories and their isoduals, for the inclusion of gravity for matter and anti-

13

matter in reversible conditions in vacuum (exterior gravitational problem);
(4,5) the genogauge theories and their isoduals, for the inclusion of gravity
for matter and antimatter in irreversible interior conditions (interior gravi-
tational problems); and (6,7) the hypergauge theories and their isoduals, for
multivalued and irreversible generalizations. This note is restricted to theo-
ries (2,3).

3. Iso-Grand-Uniﬁcation

In this note we have submitted, apparently for the ﬁrst time, an Iso-
Grand-Uniﬁcation (IGU) with the inclusion of gravity characterized by the
total isoselfdual symmetry

ˆST ot = ( ˆP(3.1) ˆ× ˆG)×( ˆP(3.1)d ˆ×d ˆGd) = [ ˆSL(2, ˆC) ˆ× ˆT (3.1)]×[ ˆSL

d

(2, ˆC d) ˆ×d ˆT d(3.1)],
(31)

where ˆPis the Poincatre’-Santilli isosymmetry(10c) in its isospinorial realization(6f ),
ˆG is the isogauge symmetry of the preceding section and the remaining struc-
tures are the corresponding isoduals.

Without any claim of a ﬁnal solution, it appears that the proposed IGU
does indeed oﬀer realistic possibilities of at least resolving the axiomatic
incompatibilities (1), (2) and (3) between gravitational and electroweak in-
teractions indicated in Sect. 1. In fact, IGU represents gravitation in a form
geometrically compatible with that of the electroweak interactions, represents
antimatter at all levels via negative-energy solutions, and charactrizes both
gravitations as well as electroweak interactions via the universal isopoincare’
symmetry.

It should be indicated that we are referring here to the axiomatic consis-
tency. The physical consistency is a separate problem which cannot possibly
be investigate in this introductory note and will be studied in future works.
At this point we merely mention the general rule according to whic, isotopic
liftings preserve not only the original axioms, but also the original numer-
ical values(5g) (as an example, the image in isominkowskian space over the
isoreals of the light cone, not only is a perfect cone, but a cone with the
original characteristic angle, thus preserving the speed of light in vacuum as
the maximal causal speed). This occurrence provides realistic hopes for the
joint achievement of axiomatic and physical consistency.

The reader should be aware that the methods of the recent memoir(4f )
permit a truly elementary, explicit construction of the proposed IGU. As well
known, the transition from the Minkowskian metric η to Riemannian met-
rics g(x) is a noncanonical transform at the classical level, and, therefore, a
nonunitary transform at the uperator level. The method herein considered
for turning a gauge theory into an IGU consists in the following representa-
tion of the selected gravitational model, e.g., Schwarzschild’s model,

14

g(x) = T (x) × η, T (x) = (U × U †)−1, eqno(32a)

U × U †) = Diag.[(1 − 2 × M/r) × Diag.(1, 1, 1), (1 − 2 × M/r)−1),

(31)

and then subjecting the totality of the gauge theory to the nonunitary trans-
form U × U †. The method then yields: the isounit I → ˆI = U × I × U †; the
isonumbers a → ˆa = U × a × U † = a × (U × U †) = a × ˆI, a = n, c; the iso-
product with the correct expression and Hermiticity of the isotopic element,
A × B → U × (A × B) × U † = (U × A × U †) × (U × U †)−1 × (U × B × U †) =
ˆA × ˆT × ˆB = ˆA ˆ× ˆB; the correct form of the isohilbert product on ˆC,
< φ| × |ψ >→ U× < φ| × |ψ > ×U † = (< ψ| × U †) × (U × U †)−1 × (U × |ψ >
) × (U × U †) =< ˆφ| × ˆT × | ˆψ > × ˆI; the correct isoalgebra A × B − B × A →
ˆA ˆ× ˆB− ˆB ˆ× ˆA; the correct isogroup U ×(eX)×U † = (eX× ˆT )× ˆI, the isopoincare
symmetry P → ˆP, and the isogauge group G → ˆG.

It is then easy to verify that the emerging IGU is indeed invariant under
all possible additional nonunitary transforms W × W † = ˆI provided that, for
evident reasons of consistency, they are written in their identical isounitary
form, W = ˆW × ˆT 1/2, W × W † = ˆW ˆ× ˆW † = ˆW † ˆ× ˆW = ˆI.
In fact, we
have the invariance of the isounit ˆI → ˆI ′ = ˆW ˆ× ˆI ˆ× ˆW † = ˆI, the invariance
of the isoproduct ˆA ˆ× ˆB → ˆW ˆ×( ˆA ˆ× ˆB) ˆ× ˆW † = ˆA′ ˆ× ˆB′, etc. Note that the
isounit is numerically preserved, as it is the case for the conventional unit
I under unitary transform, and that the selection of a nonunitary transform
W × W † = ˆI ′ with value diﬀerent than ˆI evidently implies the transition to
a diﬀerent gravitational model.

Note that the lack of implementation of the above nonunitary-isounitary
lifting to only one aspect of the original gauge theory (e.g., the preservation
of the old numbers or of the old diﬀerential calculus) implies the loss of the
invariance of the theory(4f ). The assumption of the negative-deﬁnite isounit
ˆI d = −(U × U †) then yields the isodual component of the IGU.

In closing, the most signiﬁcant possibility we would like to convey is that
gravitation has always been present in uniﬁed gauge theories. It did creep
in un-noticed because embedded where nobody looked for, in the ”unit” of
gauge theories.
In fact, the isogauge theory of Sect. 2 coincides with the
conventional theory at the abstract level to such an extend that we could
have presented the proposed IGU with exactly the same symbols of the con-
ventional gauge theories without the ”hats”, and merely subjecting the same
symbols to a more general realization.

Also, the isounit representing gravitation as per rule (32) veriﬁes all
the properties of the conventional unit I of gauge theories, ˆI ˆn = ˆI, ˆI ˆ1/2 =
ˆI, d ˆI/dt = ˆI ˆ× ˆH − ˆH ˆ× ˆI = ˆH − ˆH = 0, etc. The ”hidden” character of
gravitation in conventional gauge theories is then conﬁrmed by the isoexpec-
tation value(4f ) of the isounit which recovers the conventional unit I of gauge
theories, ˆ< ˆI ˆ> =< ˆψ| × ˆT × ˆI × ˆT × | ˆψ > / < ˆψ| × ˆT × | ˆψ >= I.

It then follows that the proposed IGU is a realization of the theory of
”hidden variables”(12a) λ, provided that they are realized in the concrete and

15

explicit form λ = T (x) = g(x)/η, and the theory is correctly reconstructed
with respect to the new unit ˆI = λ−1, in which von Neumann’s Theorem(12b)
and Bell s inequalities(12c) do not apply, evidently because of the nonunitary
character of the theory (see Vol. II of Refs. [5g] for details).

In conclusion, as indicated beginng with the title of the recent memoir(4f ),
the proposed inclusion of gravitation in uniﬁed gauge theories is essentially
along the teaching of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen(12d) on the ”lack of com-
pletion” of quantum mechanics, only applied to gauge theories.

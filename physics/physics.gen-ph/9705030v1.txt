Abstract

We generalize the geometry of Santilli’s locally anisotropic and
inhomogeneous isospaces to the geometry of vector isobundles pro-
vided with nonlinear and distinguished isoconnections and isometric
structures. We present, apparently for the ﬁrst time, the isotopies
of Lagrange, Finsler and Kaluza–Klein spaces. We also continue the
study of the interior, locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous gravita-
tion by extending the isoriemannian space’s constructions and pre-
senting a geometric background for the theory of isoﬁeld interactions
in generalized isolagrange and isoﬁnsler spaces.

1 Introduction

A number of physical problems connected with the general interior dynamics
of deformable particles while moving within inhomogeneous and anisotropic
physical media result in a study of the most general known systems which
are nonlinear in coordinates x and their derivatives ˙x, ¨x, ..., on wave func-
tions and ψ and their derivatives ∂ψ, ∂∂ψ, .... Such systems are also nonlocal
because of possible integral dependencies on all of the proceeding quantities
and noncanonical with violation of integrability conditions for the existence
of a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonian [19].

The mathematical methods for a quantitative treatment of the latter
nonlinear, nonlocal and nonhamiltonian systems have been identiﬁed by
Santilli in a series of contributions beginning the late 1970’s [20, 21, 23]
under the name of isotopies, and include axiom preserving liftings of ﬁelds
of numbers, vector and metric spaces, diﬀerential and integral calculus,
algebras and geometries. These studies were then continued by a number
of authors (see ref.
[4] for a comprehensive literature up to 1985, and
monographs [10, 12, 19, 21, 22, 26] for subsequent literature).

This paper is devoted to a study of Santilli’s isospaces and isogeome-
tries over isoﬁelds treated via the isodiﬀerential calculus according to their
latest formulation [22] (we extend this calculus for isospaces provided with
nonlinear isoconnection structure). We shall also use Kadeisvili’s notion
of isocontinuity [10] and the novel Santilli–Tsagas–Sourlas isodiﬀerential
topology [23, 26].

After reviewing the basic elements for completeness as well as for nota-
tional convenience, we shall extend Santilli’s foundations of the isosympletic
geometry [23] to isobundles and related aspects (by applying, in an isotopic
manner, the methods summarized in Miron and Anastasiei [14] and Yano
and Ishihara [34] monographs). We shall study, apparently for the ﬁrst time,
the isotopies of Lagrange, Finsler and Kaluza–Klein geometries. We shall
then apply the results to further studies of the isogravitational theories (for
isoriemannian spaces ﬁrstly considered by Santilli [23]) on vector isobun-
dle provided with compatible nonlinear and distinguished isoconnections
and isometric structures. Such isogeometrical models of isoﬁeld interaction
isotheories are in general nonlinear, nonlocal and nonhamiltonian and con-
tain a very large class of local anisotropies and inhomogeneities induced by

2

four fundamental isostructures: the partition of unity, nonlinear isoconnec-
tion, distinguished isoconnections and isometric.

The novel geometric proﬁle emerging from all the above studies is rather
remarkable inasmuch as the ﬁrst class of all isotopies herein considered
(called Kadeisvili’s Class I [10]) preserves the abstract axioms of conven-
tional formulations, yet permits a clear broadening of their applicability,
and actually result to be ”directly universal” [23] for a number of possible
well behaved nonlinear, nonlocal and nonhamiltonian systems. In turn, this
permits a number of geometric uniﬁcation such as that of all possible met-
rics (on isospaces with trivial nonlinear isoconnection structure) of a given
dimension into Santilli’s isoeuclidean metric, the uniﬁcation of exterior and
interior gravitational problems despite their sizable structural diﬀerences
and other uniﬁcation.

The view adopted in this work is that a general ﬁeld theory should in-
corporate all possible anisotropic, inhomogeneous and stochastic manifesta-
tions of classical and quantum interactions and, in consequence, correspond-
ing modiﬁcations of basic principles and mathematical methods have to be
introduced in order to formulate physical theories. There are established
three approaches for modeling ﬁeld interactions and spaces anisotropies.
The ﬁrst one is to deal with a usual locally isotropic physical theory and to
consider anisotropies as a consequence of the anisotropic structure of sources
in ﬁeld equations (for instance, a number of cosmological models are pro-
posed in the framework of the Einstein theory with the energy–momentum
generated by anisotropic matter, as a general reference see [16]). The second
approach to anisotropies originates from the Finsler geometry [9, 8, 18, 13]
and its generalizations [3, 14, 2, 5, 28, 27] with a general imbedding into
Kaluza–Klein (super) gravity and string theories [29, 30, 31], and speculates
a generic anisotropy of the space–time structure and of fundamental ﬁeld
of interactions. The Santilli’s approach is more radical by proposing a gen-
eralization of Lie theory and introducing isoﬁelds, isodualities and related
mathematical structures. Roughly speaking, by using corresponding parti-
tions of the unit we can model possible metric anisotropies as in Finsler or
generalized Lagrange geometry but the problem is also to take into account
classes of anisotropies generated by nonlinear and distinguished connections.
This is a ﬁrst paper from a series of works devoted to the formula-
tion of the theory of inhomogeneous, locally anisotropic and higher order

3

anisotropic isoﬁeld interactions (here we note that the term ”higher order”
is used as a general one for higher order tangent bundles [34], or higher order
extensions of vector superbundles [30, 31], in a number of lines alternative to
jet bundles [25, 24], and only under corresponding constraints one obtains
the geometry of higher order Lagrangians [15]). The main purpose of this
paper is to present a synthesis of the Santilli isotheory and the approach
on modeling locally anisotropic geometries and physical models on bundle
spaces provided with nonlinear connection and distinguished connection and
metric structures [14, 34]. The isotopic variants of generalized Lagrange and
Finsler geometry will be analyzed. Basic geometric constructions such as
nonlinear isoconnections in vector isobundles, the isotopic curvatures and
torsions of distinguished isoconnections and theirs structure equations and
invariant values will be deﬁned. A model of locally anisotropic and inho-
mogeneous gravitational isotheory will be constructed.

Section 2 is devoted to basic notations and deﬁnitions on Santilli and
coauthors isotheory. We introduce the bundle isospaces in Section 3 where
some necessary properties of Lie–Santilli isoalgebras and isogroups and cor-
responding isotopic extensions of manifolds are applied in order to deﬁne
ﬁber isospaces and consider their such (being very important for modeling
of isoﬁeld interactions) classes of principal isobundles and vector isobundles.
The isogeometry of nonlinear isoconnections in vector isobundles is studied
in Section 4. Isotopic distinguishing of geometric objects, the isocurvatures
and isotorsions of nonlinear and distinguished isoconnections, the structure
equations and invariant conditions are deﬁned in Section 5. The next Sec-
tion 6 is devoted to the isotopic extensions of generalized Lagrange and
Finsler geometries. The isoﬁeld equations of locally anisotropic and inho-
mogeneous interactions will be analyzed in Section 7. The outlook and
conclusions are contained in Section 8.

2 Basic Notions on Isotopies

In this section we shall mainly recall some necessary fundamental notions
and refer to works [23, 10] for details and references on Lie–Santilli isotheory.

I are of nec-
essary Kadeisvili Class I (II), the Class III being considered as the union of
the ﬁrst two, i. e. they are suﬃciently smooth, bounded, nowhere degen-
erate, Hermitian and positive (negative) deﬁnite, characterizing isotopies
(isodualities).

One demands a compatible lifting of all associative products AB of some

2.4 Santilli’s isoriemannian isospaces

Let consider R = R (x, g, R) a (pseudo) Riemannian space over the reals
R (n, +, ×) with local coordinates x = {xµ} and nonwere singular, symmet-
rical and real–valued metric g (x) = (gµν) = gt and the tangent ﬂat space
M (x, η, R) provided with ﬂat real metric η (for a corresponding signature
and dimension we can consider M as the well known Minkowski space). The
metric properties of the Riemannian spaces are deﬁned by scalar square of

The isotopies of the Riemannian spaces and geometry, were ﬁrst studied
and applied by [23] and are called Santilli’s isoriemannian spaces and ge-
ometry. In this section we consider isoriemannian spaces equipped with the
Santilli–Tsagas–Sourlas isotopology [23, 26] in a similar manner as we have
done in the previous subsection for isoeuclidean spaces but with respect

3 Isobundle Spaces

This section serves the twofold purpose of establishing of abstract index
denotations and starting the geometric backgrounds of isotopic locally ani-
sotropic extensions of the isoriemannian spaces which are used in the next
sections of the work.

3.1 Lie–Santilli isoalgebras and isogroups

The Lie–Santilli isotheory is based on a generalization of the very notion
of numbers and ﬁelds.
If the Lie’s theory is centrally dependent on the
basic n–dimensional unit I = diag (1, 1, ..., 1) in, for instance, enveloping
algebras, Lie algebras, Lie groups, representation theory, and so on, the
Santilli’s main idea is the reformulation of the entire conventional theory
with respect to the most general possible, integro–diﬀerential isounit.
In
this subsection we introduce some necessary deﬁnitions and formulas on Lie–
Santilli isoalgebra and isogroups following [10] where details, developments
and basic references on Santilli original result are contained. A Lie–Santilli

In brief one uses the term isoalgebra (when there is not confusion with
isotopies of non–Lie algebras) which is deﬁned by isolinear isocommutators

3.2 Fiber isobundles

Prof. Santilli identiﬁed the foundations of the isosympletic geometry in
the work [23]. In this section we present, apparently for the ﬁrst time, the
isotopies of ﬁbre bundles and related topics.

The notion of locally trivial ﬁber isobundle naturally generalizes that of
the isomanifold. The ﬁber isobundles will be used to get some results in
isogeometry as well as to build geometrical models for physical isotheories.
In general the proofs, being corresponding reformulation in isotopic manner

15

of standard results, will be omitted. The reader is referred to some well–
known books containing the theory of ﬁbre bundles and the mathematical
foundations of the Lie–Santilli isotheory.

As a rule, all isomanifolds are assumed to be isocontinuous, ﬁnite dimen-
sional and having the isotopic variants of the conditions to be Hausdorﬀ,
paracompact and isoconnected; all isomaps are isocontinous.

4 Nonlinear and Distinguished Isoconnecti-

ons

The concept of nonlinear connection, in brief, N–connection, is funda-
mental in the geometry of locally anisotropic spaces (in brief, la–spaces,
see a detailed study and basic references in [14]). Here it should be noted
that we consider the term la–space in a more general context than G. Yu.
Bogoslovsky [7] which uses it for a class of Finsler spaces and Finsler gravi-
tational theories. In our papers [27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33] the la–spaces and la–
superspaces are respectively modelled on vector bundles and vector super-
bundles enabled with compatible nonlinear and distinguished connections
and metric structures (as particular cases, on tangent bundles and super-
bundles, for corresponding classes of metrics and nonlinear connections, one
constructs generalized Lagrange and Finsler spaces and superspaces). The
geometrical objects on a la–space are called distinguished (see detailes in
[14]) if they are compatible with the N–connection structure (one considers,
for instance, distinguished connections and distinguished tensors, in brief,
d–connections and d–tensors).

In this section we study, apparently for the ﬁrst time, the isogeometry
of N–connection in vector isobundle. We note that a type of generic non-
linearity is contained by deﬁnition in the structure of isospace (it can be
associated to a corresponding class of nonlinear isoconnections which can
be turned into linear ones under corresponding isotopic transforms). As to
a general N–connection introduced as a global decompositions of a vector
isobundle into horizontal and vertical isotopic subbundles (see below) it can
not be isolinearized if its isocurvature is nonzero.

Isotorsions and Isocurvatures

le

The notions of isotorsion and isocurvature were introduced in the ref. [23]
on an isoriemannian spaces. In this section we reformulate these notions on
isobundles provided with N–isoconnection and d–isoconnection structures.

We note that isotorsions (5.4) and isocurvatures (5.7) can be computed
by particular cases of d–isoconnections when d–isoconnections (4.11), or
(4.12) are used instead of (4.8) and (4.9). The above presented formulas are
similar to (2.8),(2.9) and (2.10) being distinguished (in the case of locally
anisotropic and inhomogeneous isospaces) by N–isoconnection structure.

Isobianchi and Isoricci Identities

The isobianchi and isoricci identities were ﬁrst studied by Santilli [23] on an
isoriemannian space. On spaces with N–connection structures the general
formulas for Bianchi and Ricci identities (for osculator and vector bun-
dles, generalized Lagrange and Finsler geometry) have been considered by
Miron and Anastasiei [14] and Miron and Atanasiu [15]. We have extended
the Miron–Anastasiei–Atanasiu constructions for superspaces with local and
higher order anisotropy in refs. [31, 30, 33]. The purpose of this section is
to consider distinguished isobianchi and isorichi for vector isobundles.
The isotorsion and isocurvature of every linear isoconnection
v–isobundle satisfy the following generalized isobianchi identities:

T M and to use them in order to develop
tangent isobundle, t–isobundle,
the geometry of Finsler and Lagrange isospaces.

All results presented in the preceding section on v–isobundles provided
with N–isoconnection, d–isoconnection and isometric structures hold good

We note that the natural compatibility conditions (6.6) for the isomet-
H 2n–spaces plays an important role
ric (6.5) and C
for developing physical models on la–isospaces. In the case of usual locally
anisotropic spaces geometric constructions and d–covariant calculus are very
similar to those for the Riemann and Einstein–Cartan spaces. This is ex-
ploited for formulation in a selfconsistent manner the theory of spinors on
la–spaces [28], for introducing a geometric background for locally anisotropic
Yang–Mills and gauge like gravitational interactions [27] and for extend-
ing the theory of stochastic processes and diﬀusion to the case of locally
anisotropic spaces and interactions on such spaces [32]. In a similar man-
ner we can introduce N–lifts to v- and t–isobundles in order to investigate
isotopic gravitational la–models.

7 Isogravity on Locally Anisotropic and In-

homogeneous Isospaces

The conventional Riemannian geometry can be generally assumed to be
exactly valid for the exterior gravitational problem in vacuum where bodies
can be well approximated as being massive points, thus implying the validity
of conventional and calculus.

On the contrary, there have been serious doubt dating back to E. Car-
tan on the same exact validity of the Riemannian geometry for interior
gravitational problem because the latter imply internal eﬀects which are
arbitrary nonlinear in the velocities and other variables, nonlocal integral
and of general non–(ﬁrst)–order Lagrangian type.

Santilli [20, 21, 22, 23] constructed his isoriemannian geometry and pro-
posed the related isogravitation theory precisely to resolve the latter short-
coming. In fact, the isometric acquires an arbitrary functional; dependence
thus being able to represent directly the locally anisotropic and inhomoge-
neous character of interior gravitational problems.

A remarkable aspect of the latter advances is that they were achieved

38

by preserving the abstract geometric axioms of the exterior gravitation.
In fact, exterior and interior gravitation are uniﬁed in the above geometric
approach and are merely diﬀerentiated by the selected unit, the trivial value
I = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) yielding the conventional gravitation in vacuum while
more general realization of the unit yield interior conditions under the same
abstract axioms (see ref. [10] for an independent study).

A number of applications of the isogeometries for interior problems have
already been identiﬁed, such as (see ref. [22] for an outline): the represen-
tation of the local variation of the speed of light within physical media such
as atmospheres or chromospheres; the representation of the large diﬀerence
between cosmological redshift between certain quasars and their associated
galaxies when physically connected according to spectroscopic evidence; the
initiation of the study of the origin of the gravitation via its identiﬁcation
with the ﬁeld originating the mass of elementary constituents.

As we have shown [29, 30] the low energy limits of string and super-
string theories give also rise to models of (super)ﬁeld interactions with lo-
cally anisotropic and even higher order anisotropic interactions. The N–
connection ﬁeld can be treated as a corresponding nonlinear gauge ﬁeld
managing the dynamics of ”step by step” splitting (reduction) of higher
dimensional spaces to lower dimensional ones. Such (super)string induced
(super)gravitational models have a generic local anisotropy and, in conse-
quence, a more sophisticate form of ﬁeld equations and conservation laws
and of corresponding theirs stochastic and quantum modiﬁcations. Per-
haps similar considerations are in right for isotopic versions of sting theo-
ries. That it is why we are interested in a study of models of isogravity
with nonvanishing nonlinear isoconnection, distinguished isotorsion and, in
general, non–isometric ﬁelds.

By using decompositions (7.1)–(7.5) it is possible an explicit projection
of equations (7.6)–(7.8) into vertical and horizontal isocomponents (for sim-

Equations (7.6) constitute the fundamental ﬁeld equations of Santilli iso-
gravitation [20, 21, 22, 23] written in this case for vector isobundles provided
with compatible N- and d–isoconnection and isometric structures. The alge-
braic equations (7.7) have been here added, apparently for the ﬁrst time for
isogravity with isotorsion (see also [27, 33, 31] for locally anisotropic grav-
ity and supergravity) in order to close the system of gravitational isoﬁeld
equations (really we have also to take into account the system of constraints

41

(4.5) if locally anisotropic inhomogeneous gravitational isoﬁeld is associated
to a d–isometric (4.6), or to a d–isometric (6.5) if the isogravity is modelled
on a tangent isobundle). It should be noted here that the system of iso-
gravitational ﬁeld equations (7.8) presents a synthesis for vector isobundles
of equations introduced by Anastasiei, [1] and [14], and of equations (2.11)
and (2.12) considered in the Santilli isotheory.

We note that on la–isospaces the divergence

does not vanish (this is a consequence of generalized isobianchi (5.8), or
(5.9), and isoricci isoidentities (5.11), or (5.12)). The problem of nonvanish-
ing of such divergences for gravitational models on vector bundles provided
with nonlinear connection structures was analyzed in [1] and [14].

The problem of total conservation laws on isospaces has been studied in
detail in ref. [20] by reformulating all isospaces considered in that paper in
terms of the isominkowskian space, with consequential elimination of cur-
vature which permits the construction of a universal symmetry and related
total conservation laws for all possible isometric.

The latter studies concerning vector isobundles with N–isoconnections

will be considered in some future works.

We end this subsection by emphasizing that isoﬁeld equations of type
(7.6)–(7.8) can be similarly introduced for the particular cases of locally
anisotropic isospaces with metric (6.5) on ˜T M with coeﬃcients parametri-
zed as for the isolagrange, (6.3), or isoﬁnsler, (6.4), isospaces.

8 Concluding Remarks and Further Possi-

bilities

One of the most important aspects we attempted to convey in this work is
the possiblity to formulate isotopic variants of extended Finsler geometry
and the application of this isogeometric background in contemporary theo-
retical and mathematical physics. The approach adopted here provides us
an essentially self–contained, concise and signiﬁcantly simple treatment of
the material on bundle isospaces enabled with compatible isotopic nonlinear
and distinguished isoconnections and isometric structures.

42

A remarkable features worth recalling is that the considerable broad-
ening of the capabilities of the isotheory via the additional of nonlinear,
nonlocal and noncanonical eﬀects, is done via the same abstract axioms of
the conventional formulations.

In this paper we have discussed the basic geometric constructions for
isotopic spaces with inhomogeneity and local anisotropy. We have com-
puted the distinguished isotorsions and isocurvatures. It was shown how
to write a manifestly isotopic model of gravity with locally anisotropic and
inhomogeneous interactions of isoﬁelds. The assumptions made in deriving
the results are similar to those for the geometry of isomanifolds and to the
isoﬁeld theory.

There are various possible developments of the ideas presented here. One
of the necessary steps is the deﬁnition of locally anisotropic and inhomo-
geneous isotopic spinors and explicit constructions of physical models with
isospinor, isogauge and isogravitational interactions on locally anisotropic
isospaces. The problem of formulation of conservation laws on locally
anisotropic and inhomogeneous isospaces and for locally anisotropic and
inhomogeneous isoﬁeld interactions presents a substantial intrested for in-
vestigations. Here we add the theory of isostochastic processes, the super-
symmetric extension of the concept of isotheory as well possible generaliza-
tions of the mentioned constructions for higher order anisotropies in string
theories. These tasks remain for future research.

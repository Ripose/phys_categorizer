This paper uses a novel approach to wave propagation in linear media inside the Fabry-Perot
framework, called the S-Formalism. It introduces a new ﬁeld variable related to the time-averaged
Poynting vector which states that, in general, its magnitude could be nonequivalent with the squared-
ﬁeld amplitude modulus contrary to commonly accepted idea, yet for linear media. This analysis
shows explicitly the cases where these magnitudes are nonequivalents in a linear dielectric and ohmic
conductor and insinuates the possible conceptual and practical implications of this feature.

INTRODUCTION

A today well-established concept in classical electro-
dynamics is the equivalence between the time-averaged
Poynting vector modulus, i.e. the electromagnetic radia-
tion intensity (I), and the squared-ﬁeld amplitude mod-
ulus (|E|2). It is known that this statement is true for
a single harmonic plane wave propagating through semi-
inﬁnite or inﬁnite linear media [1, 2, 3]. Based on this re-
sult, the equivalence between I and |E|2 is then taken as
general and applied for bounded as well as nonlinear me-
dia [4]. It is a common practice, in the most text-books
and papers, to analyze the squared-ﬁeld amplitude mod-
ulus as equivalent to the intensity when the latter needs
to be calculated.

On the other hand, the pioneer Chen and Mills’s work
[5] was the starting point to argue the possible nonequiva-
lence between these magnitudes in nonlinear media. The
nonequivalence was established in a recent work which
presents a novel approach to wave propagation inside of
a nonlinear Fabry-Perot framework, called S-Formalism
[6]. The key of this approach is to introduce a new
ﬁeld variable related to the time-averaged Poynting vec-
tor which permits directly to show that its magnitude
could be nonequivalent with the squared-ﬁeld amplitude
In Ref.
modulus contrary to commonly accepted idea.
[6], it is suggested that nonequivalence could present in
linear as well as nonlinear media but a quantitative anal-
ysis was done only for nonlinear media. Therefore, the
aim of this paper is to apply the S-Formalism for a linear
Fabry-Perot and show the cases where the relationship
I = cte|E2| holds not true. Thereby, we pretend to break
the established idea referred to the equivalence between
both parameters which could be mistaken, yet for trivial
linear media here considered.

Below, we review the principal

features of the S-
Formalism to ﬁnally apply it to derive the spatial evolu-
tion of both interest magnitudes: squared-ﬁeld amplitude

absorbent and nonabsorbent linear media. Then, I and
|E|2 are analyzed showing the cases in which the equiv-
alence does not hold true. Finally, the conceptual and
practical implications of this feature are explored.

S-FORMALISM APPROACH

We consider the Fabry-Perot wave propagation geom-
etry as showed in the Fig. 1. From region I, a lin-
early polarized transversal harmonic plane wave of elec-
tric amplitude E0, frequency ω, and wave vector k0 im-
pinges perpendicularly (z-direction) on a linear, nonmag-
netic, homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially nondisper-
sive medium of thickness d (region II). The optical ﬁeld
maintains constant its polarization so that a scalar ap-
proach is valid. The reﬂected and transmitted plane
waves have amplitudes rE0 and tE0 with r and t the
complex reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients, respec-
tively. The general structure of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

At region II, instead of utilize the conventional counter-

as

where the dimensionless amplitude E(z), and phase φ(z),
are both real functions of z.

being S the ﬁeld variable that characterize the S-
Formalism. From Eq. (5) it is clear that when φ is not a
linear function on z, then S and E 2 are nonequivalents.
The next step is to transform the linear Helmholtz
equation (HE) into a set of equivalent equations in terms
of (E, S). For a medium characterized by the linear sus-
ceptibility χ and Ohmic conductivity σ, the HE is [1]

From Eqs. (4) and (10), the transmittance is obtained as

showing that S and E 2 always coincide at medium exit
interface with the advertisement that this should lead
to false view that they are equivalents. Also the energy
conservation is guaranteed thorough the expression:

|r|2 + |t|2 = 1 − (S(0) − S(d)) .

Equations (8) and (10) represent the ”S-Formalism”
which were derived without assuming the counter-
propagating wave approach.
Its principal advantage is
the possibility of monitoring, simultaneously, the in-
tensity I(z) = I0S(z) through the variable S, and
the squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus |E(z)|2 = E2
0 E 2(z)
through E 2, as a function of the spatial coordinate z,
contrary to the counter-propagating formalism.

FIG. 2: Spatial evolution of the dimensionless intensity S
and squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus E 2 for a linear dielec-

which shows the nonequivalence of both magnitudes within
the Fabry-Perot geometry. The parameter values are χ = 5,
λ = 632 nm and d = 2.2λ.

LINEAR DIELECTRIC

The linear dielectric is the simplest nonabsorbent
medium. It is clear from Eq. (8b) that the dimensionless
intensity S is a constant ﬁxed by the boundary condi-
tions when σ = 0. In this case the analytical solutions
for S and E 2 are very simple

at normal incidence, i. e. the Airy-formula calculated in
the most text-books in terms of the counter-propagating
wave approach [2]. The solutions (13) explicitly show
that the intensity is nonequivalent to the squared-ﬁeld
amplitude modulus. The intensity is a constant within
the medium while the squared-ﬁeld amplitude is an os-
cillatory function, looked from the counter-propagating
waves point of view as product of the spatial superposi-
tion of the forward and backward waves. Figure 2 points
out this nonequivalence. To our knowledge, this result
never was pointed out. On the contrary, the equivalence
between these both magnitudes never was questioned for
harmonic plane waves.

The above leads to the follow question: when both
magnitudes are really equivalents? For this, our analysis
indicates that the squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus must
also be a constant. Under these conditions, Eqs.
(8)
relate S and E by

S = (1 + χ)1/2 E 2
(14)
This case corresponds to the early case of a single plane
wave propagating in a inﬁnite or semi-inﬁnite dielectric
[1, 2, 3].

Eq. (13a) coincides with the classical transmittance re-
sult for the linear dielectric with Fabry-Perot geometry

The linear absorber or Ohmic conductor medium is
characterized by σ 6= 0. For such media, the wave prop-
agation and transmittance problems at Fabry-Perot ge-
ometry is generally treated by a few some text-book due
to the troublesome of the calculus [3].
In return, it is
simple to ﬁnd the analytical solutions of S and E 2 within
the S-Formalism from Eqs. (8) and (10) which are given
by

It is directly veriﬁed that Eqs. (15) reduce to Eqs. (13)
for the limit σ → 0. The solutions (15) are depicted in
Fig. 3 for diﬀerent conductivity relative values showing
that the intensity is again nonequivalent to the squared-
ﬁeld amplitude modulus. As in the dielectric case, this
latter presents an oscillatory behavior contrary to the in-
tensity which is product of the spatial superposition of
the forward and backward waves. For relatively small
values of σ/ (ǫ0ω) [Fig.3(a)], both, the intensity and the
squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus envelope, decrease as
the relative spatial coordinate increases, as a consequence
of the medium absorption. Due to small conductivity val-
ues, the squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus envelope atten-
uation is slight implying an intense forth and back wave
superposition. On the other hand, Fig. 3(b) was de-
picted for intermediary σ/ (ǫ0ω) value. The attenuation
of the ﬁeld amplitude modulus is now stronger acquiring
it a quasi-negligible value at interface z = d. This still
produces a very small superposition eﬀect and therefore
E 2 manifests a slightly oscillatory decreasing behavior.
Therefore, the intensity and the squared-ﬁeld amplitude
modulus are yet nonequivalents. Finally, Fig. 3(c) was
depicted for a relatively high value of σ/ (ǫ0ω). In this
case, the ﬁeld amplitude modulus is quite attenuated be-
fore to reach the interface z = d. Due to back wave inex-
istence, the wave superposition does not produce and the
oscillatory behavior of E 2 disappears. The medium be-
haves as semi-inﬁnite and the intensity and the squared-
ﬁeld amplitude turn completely equivalents verifying that

S(z) = Re{nc} E 2(z),

(16)

where nc =
index.

Finally, we formulate to the following question: has
this nonequivalence conceptual consequences only, or also
experimental implications? Experimentally, it is com-
mon to work with the well-known Beer’s Law to account
the optical absorption. Considering reﬂection at inter-
face z = 0, the dimensionless intensity given by Beer’s
Law attenuates as

IB(z) = S(0) exp (−αz),

(17)

being α = 2k0Im{nc} the absorption constant charac-
terizing the absorptive medium properties. This Law is
an approximate result neglecting any internal ﬁeld su-
perposition eﬀect. Expression (17) was also depicted in
Figure 3 with the aim to compare the Beer’s Law inten-
sity with the true intensity and the squared-ﬁeld ampli-
tude modulus within the medium.
It happens that IB
departures slightly of S for a wide range of usual param-
eters. Thereby, the real transmittance S(d) could not
diﬀer appreciably from the approximated transmittance
value IB(d) used often in usual experiments. However,
the validity of this approximation must be rigourously

tested for each particular problem since the diﬀerence
S(d) − IB(d) depends on material parameters as χ, σ
and d. Our simulations report cases where this diﬀer-
ence is approximately 10% and it could implied an error
of the order of 40% in the χ estimation.

CONCLUSIONS

A new approach was used to show that yet in triv-
ial linear media, the squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus
of the electric ﬁeld and the radiation intensity could
be nonequivalents on the contrary to today established
idea. The S-Formalism utilizes a new set of ﬁeld variables
(S, E) related each one to both relevant magnitudes I and
|E|. The above analysis proves that the nonequivalence of
I and |E|2 is due to a superposition process between the
forward and backward waves which causes an oscillatory
behavior for the squared-ﬁeld amplitude modulus con-
trary to the intensity which does not present such behav-
ior. In return, when the superposition process can be ne-
glected, the medium can be treated as semi-inﬁnite with
a single wave propagating such that S and E 2 are equiv-
alents. The simulations also show that the usual Beer’s
Law approximated intensity used to calculate the trans-
mittance in usual experiments could departure signiﬁca-
tively from real measured intensity. Thereby, the valid-
ity of this approximation should be rigourously tested for
each particular experimental problem.

The statement pointed out here constitutes an advance
on conceptual views of basic ideas in electrodynamics

5

since there is a widespread view among researchers that
the radiation intensity and the squared-ﬁeld amplitude
modulus are always equivalents. Several generations of
scientist have been taught this. As a result, we often
have been blinded by our misconceptions, and thereby
have been prevent from exploring many possible new im-
portant features.

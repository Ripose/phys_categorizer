Abstract

After the introduction to the subject, we review the Machian relations involving the diﬀerent

kinds of energy densities in the Universe. By suposing that dark-matter is composed by Neutrino’s
massive energy, we hint that the Neutrino’s masses should be proportional to R−1, while the total
number of Neutrinos in the Universe increases with R2 , where R stands for Hubble’s length.
This makes possible that the dark mater-energy density be of Neutrinos origin, to vary with R−2

, as is necessary for a Machian Universe. The neutrino average mass is estimated for the present
Universe (=10−76g).

ON A TIME VARIATION OF NEUTRINO’S MASS

Marcelo Samuel Berman and Fernando de Mello Gomide

I - INTRODUCTION

The subject of mass-varying neutrinos, has been very recently given attention[22][23][24].

But, ﬁrst, let us make an historical review of the neutrino research.

In 1930 the Austrian theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, Nobel Prize due to his research

on the electron spin, veriﬁed in the processes of electron emission from neutrons, that the

energy-momentum balance was violated. In other terms: the much solid principle of energy-

momentum conservation of special relativity seemed to loose its preeminence at the basis of

every physical theory. Well something highly perplexing, for in spite of being universally ap-

plied to all known high energy processes, it could not be corroborated in this special process

of electron emission from neutrons, the so called Beta emission process. A painful problem

of course, but brilliantly solved through Pauli’s revolutionary hypothesis and Enrico Fermi’s

theory, in 1934, [2]. Pauli postulated the existence of a new particle, the neutrino[1] that was

responsible for the disappearence of energy-momentum in the neutron decay (beta emission).

Fermi forwarded the neutrino theory wherein it is deduced that this new postulated neutral

particle has a probability of interaction with other particles, 10 to power 22 times smaller

than what was known then. Therefore the neutrino acted as if a phantom particle that could

not be easely detected. Only in 1953, twenty years after Fermi’s theory, was the particle to

emerge to existence, thanks to the experiments done by two American experimental physi-

cists, Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan. They used then a new detection technique that

aﬀorded the possibility for detection of an eﬀect predicted by Fermi. It was the tecnique

based on a diﬀerent type of particle detector, the scintillation counter. Being faithful to a

fundamental physical principle, the energy-momentum conservation, Pauli and Fermi were

responsible for one of the most important scientiﬁc discovery of the XXth century. Fermi’s

predictions from his theory were widely veriﬁed by the community of high-energy physicists,

such that nobody doubted the existence of the putative neutrino. Frederick Reines who

received the Nobel Prize in 1995 made the following important epistemological comment:

2

“It must be recognized, however, that independent of the observation of a ‘free neutrino’

interaction with matter, the Fermi theory was so attractive in its explanation of beta decay

that belief in the neutrino as a ‘real’ entity was general”.[1]

Reines’ comment is a remarkable epistemological judgement in so far as to view certain

experimental evidence of a theory, not something clinching or crucial. Fermi’s theory oﬀered

a gallaxy of eﬀects in high-energy physics of so important level, that the putative neutrino

could be kept as such for 20 years without bothering physicists. Reiner and Cowan’s discov-

ery of the free neutrino was not a crucial test of a theory, but an experimental success after

a history of theoretical and other experimental evidences. We are going to deal afterwards

on the question of clinching experimental proofs. An analogous situation we are going to

point out in the history of the heliocentric theory, accepted by every astronomer of the

XVIIth century without the “clinching proof” of stellar parallax obtained by Bessel on the

XIXth century. Let us remind that Enrico Fermi’s theory of 1934 is considered the birth of

quantum ﬁeld theory[2], which is cornerstone in elementary particles theory. Fermi received

the Nobel in 1938.

tiparticles’ counterpart.

The present theory of material reality’s oﬀers three families of elementary particles:

6 quarks and 6 antiquarks.

Leptons and antileptons: electron, muon, tau-particle, neutrino-e, neutrino-mu

Gauge bosons: photon, W+, W-, Z, and Gluon. Being bosons they have no an-

Let us add some considerations as to the three neutrinos. The neutrino developed in

Fermi’s theory and detected by Reines and Cowan was called by Feinberg in 1958, neutrino-

e, since it was related to the beta decay of the neutron. Besides Feinberg predicted that the

neutrino generated by the muon decay should be diﬀerent and it was then named neutrino-

mu. Through an experiment done in 1962 by Leon Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger, the

prediction was brilliantly corroborated[3]. In 21/7/2000 a group of 54 American, Japanese,

Korean, and Greek physicists at Fermilab, announced the detection of the neutrino-tau.[4]

The neutrino-tau results from the decay of the lepton tau particle. Thus, from 1953 to 2000

the 3 neutrinos predicted in the theoretical structure had been detected.

From 1967 to 1998 several experiments were done in order to measure the neutrino ﬂux

produced in the Sun. As we know the thermonuclear reactions inside our star, would produce

3

abundant torrents of neutrinos-e. The ﬁrst measurements done in 1967 by Ray Davies oﬀered

a perplexing result: the ﬂux measured had been about 1/3 of the predicted value[5][6]. In

1969 the Italian physicist Pontecorvo suggested a hypothesis that would account for the

missing Solar neutrinos: en route to Earth part of them would oscillate to a diﬀerent type

of neutrinos. This hypothesis was endorsed in 1985 by two Russian physicists Miteyev and

Smirnov:

from the Sun to Earth a substantial part of neutrinos-e would transform into

neutrinos-mu or tau[7].

According to the standard model of elementary particles theory, the property of oscil-

lation of a neutrino into another type pressuposes the existence of mass. Hence the old

assumption of the massless neutrino should be disposed oﬀ. A team of 300 American and

Japanese physicists at Takayma proceeded to an experiment with the huge detector Super-

Kamiokande in order to detect oscillation of neutrino-mu into neutrino-tau in the ﬂux of

secondary cosmic rays. In spite of the cautious language of Yoshiro Suzuki of the Univer-

sity of Tokio, the results strongly favour the oscillation of neutrinos-mu[8]. These ﬁndings

with the Super-Kamiokande are regarded as compelling but not deﬁnitive[9]. More recently,

Tsuyoshi Nakaya of Kyoto University announced in June, 2004 at a meeting in Paris, a

reassuring conﬁrmation of the oscillation mechanism, that is: strong evidence of oscilla-

tion of neutrino-mu into neutrino tau[10]. The square masses of the neutrino eigenstates

were measured from the Super-Kamiokande data and were in agreement with the oscillation

parameters from atmospheric data.

Notwithstanding the successes obtained, new theoretical problems are being tackled in

the domain of the physics of neutrinos[11]. Well there is no end in the quest for knowledge

and understanding of reality: problems solved open the doors for new problems.

II MACHIAN RELATIONS FOR DARK MATTER ENERGY

It has been asserted, that 67% of the energy density of the Universe, is due to a cosmolog-

ical ”constant” energy. The restant energy density is fractioned in two parts: 5% as visible

mass and 28% as dark matter. Let us suppose that dark matter is constituted by neutri-

nos with non-zero rest mass. Berman[12][13][14] has suggested that,

if Mach’s principle is

understood as meaning that the total energy of the Universe is null, and if each particular

energy contribution to the total energy density, has constant participation during the whole

4

history of the Universe, one may obtain diﬀerent Machian relations. These Machian rela-

tions, of which, the Brans-Dicke [15] relation is a particular case, should not, according to

Berman, be viewed as just coincidental with the present Universe. Suppose that the total

energy is given by:

E = Mc2 − GM 2

2R + 4πΛ R3

3κ + L2
M R2

,

(1)

where the four terms to the right of relation (1) represent respectively the inertial, grav-

itational, cosmological constant’s and rotational energies.

GM
2c2R

− 4π

3κ h

ΛR3
c2M i

− L2

c2M 2R2 = 1

.

(3)

If no one of the above terms will increase or decrease diﬀerent than the others, we can

solve equation (3) by imposing that:

When we impose,

E = 0

,

we obtain:

GM
2c2R = γ1

,

ΛR3
4π
c2M i = γ2
3κ h

c2M 2R2 = γ3

,

,

where the γ ’s obey the conditions:

1) γi = constant

( i = 1, 2, 3 )

2)

γ1 − γ2 − γ3 = 1

,

.

5

It can be checked that, due to the original Brans-Dicke relation [15],

GM
c2R

∼
= 1

,

and also because of the above arguments, all the γ ’s have a near unity value. We thus

obtain, with Berman[14], the following variation laws:

M ∝ R

L ∝ R2

;

;

Λ ∝ R−2

.

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

The Machian relations (4)(5)(6) have been noticed long ago, as approximate relations for

the present Universe; the radical departure made by Berman, is contained in the fact that

the γ ’s are constant during the lifespan of the Universe, and not only for the present

time, so that relations (10)(11)(12), are valid during all times.

We now can obtain the corresponding energy densities for the above relations:

ρ1 = M

3 πR3 = h

6γ1c2
4πG i R−2

ρ2 = Λ

κ = h

γ2γ1c4
2πG i R−2

,

,

ρ3 = h

L2
M R2 i
3 πR3 = h
4

3γ1γ3c4
2πG i R−2

.

and,

write:

We can check that all energy densities are proportional to R−2 , so that, we can also

ρT OT = ρ1 + ρ2 + ρ3 = ΓR−2

( Γ = constant )

.

(16)

In the spirit of inﬂationary Cosmology [16], we identify, for the present Universe, ρT OT

with the critical density, so that we would have:

ρT OT

∼
= 2 x 10−29 g / cm3

.

In the next Section, we calculate an estimate for neutrinos mass, and its time variation.

But, we observe that, if dark matter is a fraction of ρT OT
on R−2 , so as to keep all relative components equally balanced along time.

, this fraction will also depend

III A theory for neutrinos energy density

As we have noticed before the energy density of dark matter, to be identiﬁed with neu-

trinos, shall be given by:

ρν = 0.27ρT OT

Berman [17] along with others (see Sabbata and Sivaran, 1994 [21]) have estimated that
the Universe possess a magnetic ﬁeld which, for Planck’s Universe, was as huge as 1055
Gauss. The relic magnetic ﬁeld of the present Universe is estimated in 10−6 Gauss. We

can then, suppose that all neutrinos’ spins have been alligned with the magnetic ﬁeld. On

the other hand, the spin of the Universe is believed to have increased in accordance with

Machian relation (6) above, which entails relation (11) above. If we call n the number of

neutrinos in the present Universe, and nP l

its value for Planck’s Universe, we may write:

We have just obtained the relation for the increase of the number of neutrinos with R2

If we impose relation (17) and simultaneously, relations (16) and (20), we conclude two

We see now that while the number of neutrinos in the Universe increases with R2 , the

rest mass decreases with R−1 ; we may obtain, with R ∼

One of us (F.M. Gomide, [25]), has estimated the mass of neutrinos a long time ago,
ﬁnding, in a seminal paper , the value, 10−65 g. Gomide[25] in fact has equated mνc2

with the self-gravitational energy of the proton. If one equates the self-gravitational energy
of the electron, with mνc2 , with R as the electron Compton radius, we would ﬁnd 10−72

g.

IV Conclusions

A law of variation for the number of neutrinos in the Universe has been found. A law of

variation for the rest mass of neutrinos was also found.

We remind the reader that Kaluza-Klein’s cosmology [18][19], consider time varying rest

masses, in a penta-dimensional space-time-matter, of which the ﬁfth coordinate is rest mass.

The above results can not be rejected, for the time being, by any known data. We point

out, that some of the features of the present

calculation, are originated from a seminal

paper by Sabbata and Gasperini [20].

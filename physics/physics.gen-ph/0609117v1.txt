Abstract

Dimensional analysis provides many simple and useful tools for various situations in sci-
ence. The objective of this paper is to investigate its relations to functions, i.e., the dimen-
sions for functions that yield physical quantities and those for the arguments of functions. In
particular, it is shown that there are three types of functions from a viewpoint of dimensional
analysis. The results presented here seem to be useful in several aspects and can also be ap-
plied to similar circumstances in other disciplines which deal with quantities with dimensions.

Keywords: Dimensional Analysis, Π-Theorems.

1. Introduction

Dimensional analysis is a very simple but powerful toolbox to infer or to verify physical
formula. Plenty of examples of its applications can be found in books [1, 2]. The aim of this
paper is to investigate another aspect of dimensional analysis, which focuses on its relations
to various functions. As for the author he has not encountered treatises or papers that touch
upon the topic explicitly, although it is also helpful in order to infer or to verify physical for-
mula. Actually it will be of beneﬁt to know, for instance, that the arguments of exponential
and trigonometric functions must be dimensionless.

We deal with phenomena involving some quantities with dimensions and we assume that a
system of dimensional units is given throughout. If we are studying physical phenomena, we will
need the SI system or the MKS system, for example. In this paper we denote the dimension of
a quantity (variable) φ by D(φ) instead of the conventional notation [φ], since we are concerned
only with relations between dimensions of quantities in general rather than speciﬁc physical
laws.

be a minimal system of dimensional units for describing physical phenom-
ena with which we are concerned. This means that any dimensional quantity φ has a dimension
represented by D(φ) = AaBb
C c, where a, b, . . . , c are all rational numbers, which are uniquely
determined by the dimension of φ. This assumption is wide enough for dimensional analysis
to be applied elsewhere. The following six properties are trivial in physics and we take it for
granted that they are valid not only in physics but in other disciplines that deal with dimen-
sional quantities. These provide us with our starting point of the discussions and will be freely
utilized.

important role in dimensional analysis, too.

Another usage of constants is illustrated by the following example. Let us consider a second-
order diﬀerential equation ψ′′ + ψ = 0 in view of dimensional analysis. Here ψ is an unknown
function of φ. To this end we need set ψ′′ + aψ = 0 by introducing a constant a. Then, putting
D(φ) = A and D(ψ) = B, we postulate a = 1 and D(a) = A−2. We keep a as such a constant in
the course of solving the equation and ﬁnally put a = 1.

The next section is devoted to the investigations of the dimensions for functions that yield
physical quantities and the dimensions for the arguments of the functions. In particular, giving
simple examples, we show that there are three types of functions from a viewpoint of dimen-
sional analysis. As an illustrative example of application we give simple second-order ordinary
diﬀerential equations. We refer to an easily available reference [3] that deals with solutions of
ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations by dimensional analysis. Our results may be applied to
some examples of diﬀerential equations treated therein. The ﬁnal section supplies some related
remarks.

It is easily recognized that the theory proposed in this paper can also be applied to similar
circumstances in other disciplines, e.g., engineering, economics or biology, which involve quan-
tities with dimensions.

2. Dimensional Analysis and Functions

In order to describe physical laws we need fundamental functions; exponential, logarith-
mic and trigonometric functions etc. They are building blocks for more complicated functions.
We look at these functions from a viewpoint of dimensional analysis.

We can classify such functions ψ = ψ(φ) into the following three types in view of dimensions
of both φ and ψ. Note that the ﬁrst two types of functions can take dimensional quantities as
their arguments. The examples taken here are the simplest ones exhibiting respective features.
Even these simple examples have interesting implications. In the next section a procedure for
obtaining functions of respective types will be given that is based on the consideration of this
section.

Type I. Both φ and ψ can have dimensions.

A typical and obvious example is the power function ψ = φr with r a non-zero rational
number; φ3, φ−1 and √φ etc. It is obvious that it has a dimension if the argument φ has a
dimension; D(ψ) = (D(φ))r

= 1.

Type II. ψ is dimensionless, whatever the dimension of φ is.

An important example is the logarithmic function. As for the deﬁnition of (natural) loga-

rithmic function we take

ψ = ln φ =

.

Therefore, we see that ψ is dimensionless, since so is the part φ−1dφ, whatever the dimension
of φ is. Hence we always have

D(ln φ) = 1,

(1)

whether φ has a dimension or not.

There are many laws involving the logarithmic function ln φ with D(φ)

= 1 in physics, where
φ may have a dimension of volume or temperature etc. Using (1), it is easy to see that functions
of the form ψ = φr ln φ with r non-zero rational numbers are of Type I.

Type III. Both φ and ψ must be dimensionless; D(φ) = D(ψ) = 1.

Examples for this type include all of trigonometric functions. We show this by ψ = sin φ.

We begin with the integral

for a positive constant a. In order for a2
ψ2 to be meaningful, D(ψ) = D(a) must hold and we
get D(ψ/a) = 1, from which we see that φ must be dimensionless. Writing it as sin φ = ψ/a, it
also follows that D(sin φ) = 1. It is easy to see that all other trigonometric functions are of this
type.

Another important example of Type III is the exponential function. We have, for some

positive constant a,

φ = ln ψ

Here φ is dimensionless, as is shown in Type II, and D(ψ) = D(a). Rewriting this as ψ/a = eφ,
we see that D(eφ) = 1.

From the discussion of Type III we can observe that whenever the exponential function

3. Some Remarks

In this section a procedure for obtaining functions of Type II or III is considered by means
of the results in the previous section, and ﬁnally a remark will be made on the relation to the
Π-theorem in dimensional analysis.
It is not a general procedure for the derivation of these
functions.

instance,

By (1) and the fact that sin (
) is dimensionless, we see that sin(ln φ) becomes dimensionless.

Hence, using a similar reasoning employed in Type II, we get D(ψ) = 1 for this function ψ,
whether φ has a dimension or not.

In order to present other functions of Type III, let us deﬁne the following, for a natural

number n,

we get the formula

).

In a similar manner utilized for trigonometric functions (Type III) in section 2 we can obtain
D(a) = D(ψ) and D( n√an
ψn) = D(ψ). Hence we get D(φ) = 1. Thus, from ψ/a = Fn(φ),
we can obtain functions Fn of Type III; D(φ) = D(Fn(φ)) = 1. They are generalizations of
trigonometric functions. Indeed, when the mathematician C. F. Gauss (1777-1855) attempted
to generalize trigonometric functions, he at ﬁrst introduced and considered these functions Gn
and Fn prior to the discovery of elliptic functions.

When conventionally dealing with dimensional analysis, we often utilize the Π-theorem ([1,

2]), which requires our eﬀorts to ﬁnd a function

ψ = Π(φ1, φ2, . . . , φm).

Here all quantities together with ψ are dimensionless; D(φ1) =
= D(φm) = D(ψ) = 1. Al-
though it is a function of several variables, it seems that our results may be helpful to determine
its form.

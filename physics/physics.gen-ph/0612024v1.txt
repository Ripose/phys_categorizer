Recently Horsley and Babiker [1] reported a semiclassical calculation of the R¨ontgen phase shift and a similar
derivation of the Aharonov-Casher phase shift. Our objections to [1] are more fundamental than those from [2]. The
whole derivation of the phase shifts in [1] (and [3] as well) is based on the use of the usual transformations of the
three-dimensional (3D) vectors E and B (e.g., [4], Eq. (11.149)), neglecting terms of the order of (v/c)2. That issue
is objected in this Comment. It is assumed in [1] that in “the particle rest frame the magnetic ﬂux density B due
to the magnetic line is perceived as an electric ﬁeld” E = v × B, Eq. (1) in [1]. Then a dipole d experiences a force
F = −∇U , with U = −d · E. However U in [1] (the Lagrangian in [3]) is written in the laboratory frame (the S
frame), while the electric ﬁeld is in the rest frame of the moving dipole carrier (the S′ frame). Hence this electric ﬁeld
would need to be written E′ = v × B. Similarly, for the Aharonov-Casher eﬀect considered in [1], it would need to be
written B′ = −(1/c2)v × E. (Another usual way for the description in the laboratory frame is that one transforms
the 3D electric d and magnetic m dipoles from S′ to S.)

In [5] the fundamental results are achieved that the transformations of the 3D E and B are not relativistically
correct and have to be replaced by the Lorentz transformations (LT) of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds as 4D
geometric quantities. In my Comment [6] to Anandan’s paper [7] it is shown how the interaction (−(1/2)FabDab) of
the dipole moment tensor Dab and the electromagnetic ﬁeld F ab is written in terms of 4D geometric quantities, the
electric and magnetic dipole moments da and ma and also 4D Ea and Ba. Here we write the corresponding 4D force
K a that replaces the forces written with 3D d, m and E, B from [1,3,7] and many others, e.g., [8].

This 4D force is K c = (1/2)Dab∂cFab. F ab and Dab can be expressed as F ab = (1/c)(Eavb − Ebva) + εabcdvcBd
and Dab = (1/c)(uadb − ubda) + (1/c2)εabcducmd, with Eava = Bava = daua = maua = 0. va is interpreted as
the velocity of a family of observers who measures Ea and Ba, while ua = dxa/ds is the 4-velocity of the particle.
(The notation is as in [6].) To compare with the usual formulation with the 3D E and B we introduce the frame of
“ﬁducial” observers in which the observers who measure Ea, Ba are at rest. That frame with the {eµ} basis will be
called the e0-frame. (For simplicity, as in [6], only the standard basis {eµ; 0, 1, 2, 3} of orthonormal 4-vectors with
e0 in the forward light cone will be used.) In the e0-frame va = ce0, i.e., vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0). Hence E0 = B0 = 0 and
Ei = F i0, Bi = (1/2c)εijk0Fjk. Any decomposition of, e.g., Ea, Ba, K a, ..
is invariant under the passive LT, i.e.,
Ea = Eµeµ = E′µe′
µ, where all primed quantities are the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones. In the {eµ} basis
K a can be written as K a = K αeα = ((1/2)Dµν∂αFµν )eα. Particularly in the e0-frame K α is the sum of two terms,
one with the electric dipole (1/c2)[cd0(uν ∂αEν) − c2(dν ∂αEν) + c2ε0ijkujdk∂αBi] (responsible for the R¨ontgen eﬀect)
and another one (responsible for the Aharonov-Casher eﬀect) in which dµ is replaced by mµ, while Eµ and Bµ are
interchanged .

Let us take that the laboratory frame is the e0-frame. Then, for the R¨ontgen eﬀect from [1,3], mµ = 0, Eµ = 0,
Bµ = (0, B1, B2, 0) and uµ = (u0, u1, u2, 0), since in S′ u′µ = (c, 0, 0, 0). K α becomes K α = ε0ijkujdk∂αBi, or
explicitly, K 0 = K 3 = 0, K 1,2 = d3[u2∂1,2B1 − u1∂1,2B2]. This force diﬀers from those in [1] and [3], and contrary to
the claims in [3], the classical force is not zero even in the case when the electric dipole moment is aligned parallel to
the magnetic line charge. Only in the case when the rest frame of the particle is chosen to be the e0-frame K α = 0,
but that case is not physically realizable. The second term in K α gives the analogous result for the Aharonov-Casher
eﬀect. Hence both phase shifts could be calculated using the concept of force, but not in such way as in [1] than, e.g.,
as in [9].

QUANTIZED FRACTAL SPACE TIME

Abstract

Though Quantum SuperString Theory has shown promise, there
are some puzzling features like the extra dimensions, which are curled
up in the Kaluza-Klein sense. On the other hand a recent formula-
tion of what may be called Quantized Fractal Space Time leads to a
surprising interface with QSS - we deal with the Planck length, the
same number of extra dimensions and an identical non-commutative
geometry. It is shown that this is not accidental. On the contrary it
gives us insight into the otherwise inexplicable features of QSS.

1 Introduction

At the outset it must be pointed out that Quantum Mechanics (QM) and
Quantum Field Theory (QFT) operate in the Minkowski space time - this
is a diﬀerentiable manifold and space time points, infact point particles are
legitimate. However this contradicts the very spirit of QM - arbitrarily small
space time intervals imply arbitrarily large momenta and energies. Yet both
QM and QFT have co-existed with this unhappy situation[1]. From this
point of view, two approaches are more satisfactory. One is string theory
and the other is the discrete space time formulation. The former has evolved
into the present theory of Quantum SuperStrings (QSS) while the latter
leads to a formulation in terms of stochastic, fractal space-time. These two
approaches appear very diﬀerent, but as we will now show, they share several
strikingly similar characteristics. This will throw light on some features of

1

string theory which appear very puzzling, like the extra dimensions and the
non-commutative geometry aspect.

2 String Theory

The origin of String Theory lies in two observed features. The ﬁrst is the
Regge trajectories, J ∝ M 2, which deﬁne the higher spin resonances, and
which implies a ﬁnite size or spread in space for them.
The second feature is the dual resonance or s − t channel scattering, which
lead to the Venetziano model. It was realized that if the particles could be
given an extension of the order of the Compton wavelength, that is treated
as strings, then the puzzling s − t feature could be explained.
All this leads to strings which are governed by the equation[2]

where the frequency ω is given by

ρ¨y − T y ′′ = 0

ω =

π

2s T

ρ

T =

mc2

l

; ρ =

m
l

qT /ρ = c

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

T being the tension of the string, l its length and ρ the line density. The
identiﬁcation (3) gives (4) where c is the velocity of light, and (1) then goes
over to the usual d’Alembertian or massless Klein-Gordon equation.
It is
dx

worth noting that as l → 0 the potential energy which is ∼ R l

rapidly oscillates.
Further if the above string is quantized canonically, we get

∂x(cid:17)2
0 T (cid:16) ∂y

h∆x2i ∼ l2

(5)

The string eﬀectively shows up as an inﬁnite collection of Harmonic Oscil-
lators [2]. It must be mentioned that (5) and (3) both show that l is of the
order of the Compton wavelength. This has been called one of the miracles

2

of String theory by Veniziano[3]. Infact the minimum length l turns out to
be given by T /¯h2 = c/l2 which from (3) and (4) is seen to give the Compton
wavelength.
If the relativistic quantized string is given rotation[4], then we get back the
equation for the Regge trajectories given above. Here we are dealing with
objects of ﬁnite extension rotating with the velocity of light rather like spin-
ning Black Holes. It must be pointed out that in Super String theory, there
is an additional term a0

J ≤ (2πT )−1M 2 +a0¯h with a0 = +1(+2)for the open (closed) string (6)

In equation (6) a0 comes from a zero point energy eﬀect. When a0 = 1 we
have the usual guage bosons and when a0 = 2 we have the gravitons.
It must be mentioned that in the relativistic case, even in Classical Theory
it is known that[5, 6] there is an extension of the order of the Compton
wavelength l seen in (3) above such that within this extension there are
negative energies, reminiscent of a Dirac particle with zitterbewegung, and
indicative of the breakdown of the concept of space time points.
Finally, if we go over to the full theory of Quantum Superstrings[7, 8], we
deal with the Planck length, a non-commutative geometry and a total of ten
space time dimensions, six of which are curled up in the Kaluza-Klein sense.

3 Quantized Fractal Space time

A starting point for QFST is the observation that the electron can be con-
sidered to be a Kerr-Newman Black Hole, which is otherwise classical, but
which also describes the purely QM anomalous g = 2 factor[9]. However
there is a naked singularity, in other words the radius of the horizon becomes
complex and is given by

GM

c2 + ıb, b ≡   G2Q2

r+ =

c8 + a2 −
where a is the angular momentum per unit mass.
The same circumstance is observed in the purely QM description of the elec-
tron by the Dirac equation. This time we have

(7)

G2M 2

c4 !1/2

x = (c2p1H −1t + a1) +

ı
2

3

c¯h(α1 − cp1H −1)H −1,

(8)

The bridge between equations (7) and (8) is the fact that the imaginary term
in (8) is the zitterbewegung term which again is symptomatic of the fact that
space time points are not meaningful. Infact an average over Compton scales
removes the naked singularity.
Another way of looking at this is that for the Dirac or Klein-Gordan operator
we have a non Hermitian position operator given by

~Xop = ~xop −

ı¯hc2

2

~p
E 2

(9)

The Hermitianization of (9) leads to[10] a quantization of space time at the
Compton scale. As with strings, we have in this description a background
ZPF [10] corresponding to a collection of oscillation bounded by the Compton
wavelength. Interestingly an equation like (2) holds[6].
Thus we have to deal with space time intervals, which are a sort of a minimum
cut oﬀ. This leads to the non commutative geometry

[x, y] = 0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h[1 + l2], [t, E] = ı¯h[1 + τ 2]

(10)

[11, 12]. Interestingly using (10) we can get back the Dirac representation.
Next, from the Dirac equation we can get the Klein-Gordon equation [13, 14]
or alternatively the massless string equation (1) subject to (4). (Physically
this means that bosons are bound states of Fermions.) Further with bound
Fermions we recover the equation of Regge trajectories [15]. Interestingly, in
Superstring theory also Dirac spinors are introduced ad hoc, averages over an
internal time τ are taken, and then the Klein-Gordon equation of the bosonic
theory is deduced[16]. At the same time this space time fudge is exactly of
the type required to explain the s − t channel feature. It must be observed
that in (10) if l2 = 0, then we are back with usual space time and Quantum
Mechanics. It is only when l2 6= 0 that we have a non commutativity, leading
to Fermions. Indeed, as also noted by Witten, our usual Lorentzian space
time diﬀerentiable manifold is bosonic and leads to the bosonic string or
Klein-Gordon equation (1), - but there is a substructure given by (10) which
leads to the Fermionic description and quantized space time. The former is an
approximation when l2 = 0 and we have equation (1) and what Witten calls
bosonic space time (Cf.
[17]). The latter gives the spinorial representation
for the Lorentz group which as noted by Einstein(Cf. ref.[18]) is the more
fundamental representation and also the Dirac equation, rather than (1).

4

It is quite signiﬁcant that the above discrete space time features can be
understood in terms of the Nelsonian Theory in which the diﬀusion constant,
in the light of the above remarks has been meaningfully identiﬁed with ¯h/m
[19]. Here we are dealing with a double Weiner process[20], and the minimum
space time cut oﬀs are stochastic in nature and may be called QFST.
Infact, a quick way to Quantum Mechanics from the Nelsonian theory is by
starting with the diﬀusion equation,

∆x · ∆x =

h
m

∆t

This can be rewritten as the usual Quantum Mechanical relation,

m

∆x
∆t

· ∆x = h = ∆p · ∆x

To throw further light on this, we observe that it is well known[6] that from a
two state formulation we can recover the Schrodinger equation by considering
the diﬀusion of a particle to neighbouring points on either side, separated by
a distance of the order of the Compton wavelength. Similarly if we could
consider a diﬀusion forwards and backwards in time through a Compton
time interval reminiscent of the double Weiner process referred to, we can
get back the d’Alembertian equation, or the string equation (1). To see this
more explicitly, let us consider a point x and its neighbouring points x ± l
and a time t ± τ . Then a typical simple diﬀusion equation would be given
by [21], following Feynman,

Cı(t − τ ) + Cı(t + τ ) = Xj

[δıj −

ı
¯h

Hıj(t)τ ]Cj(t)

(11)

where we denote by, Cı(t) ≡< ı|ψ(t) >, the amplitude for the state |ψ(t) >
to be in the state |ı >, and

< ı|U|j >≡ Uıj(t + τ t, t) ≡ δıj −

ı
¯h

Hıj(t)τ t.

and ı denotes the point x and the points x ± l. In the limit l = cτ → 0 (11)
gives the Klein-Gordon equation or alternatively the equation (1) subject to
the condition (4). This also shows the close relation of the diﬀusion process
and special relativity, as noted in [19].

5

Finally in the above formulation using the spirit of ﬂuctuations and the non
commutative relation (10), we get, ∆x ∼ l3, where l is the electron Compton
wavelength[20]. We are thus lead ﬁrstly to the Planck length and secondly
to the fact that the single x dimension has now become three dimensional.
The two extra dimensions are ﬂuctuations and curled up in the Kaluza-Klein
sense[22] as shown elsewhere[20]. It must be stressed that in this formulation
we use as seen in the Super String case, the zero point ﬂuctuations.

4 Conclusion

It is not surprising that QSS and QFST reach the same extra dimensions,
non commutative geometry and Planck scale, because the former starts with
extension and then the QM input, while the latter starts with extension
and the Nelsonian QM input. From this point of view we get an insight
into the otherwise inexplicable features of QSS. As Veneziano put it [3],
”we thus face a kind of paradoxical situation. On the other hand quantum
mechanics is essential to the success of the KK idea. At the same time, QFT
gives meaningless inﬁnities and spoils the nice semiclassical results. If the
beautiful KK idea is to be saved we need a better quantum theory than QFT.
I will argue below that such a theory already exists: it is called (super) string
theory.” The key lies in space time intervals which underlie a Fermionic sub
structure of space time given by (10), which has a perfectly natural origin in
stochastic process or in the spirit of which lies ”Law without Law”[23], and
is exempliﬁed by QFST.

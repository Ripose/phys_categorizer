Abstract

Quantum systems are dynamic systems restricted by the principles of
quantum mechanics (linearity of dynamic equations, linear transformation
of the wave function etc.). One suggests to investigate the quantum systems
simply as dynamic systems, ignoring the quantum principles and constraints
imposed by them. Such dynamic methods of investigation appear to be more
adequate and eﬀective, than the conventional quantum methods of investi-
gation. Using these methods, which ignore the quantum principles, one can
overcome the principal problem of quantum ﬁeld theory: join of nonrelativis-
tic quantum principles with the relativity principles. Investigation of dynamic
system SS, described by the Schr¨odinger equation, admits one to prove that
the Copenhagen interpretation is incompatible with quantum mechanics for-
malism. Besides, it is shown that sometimes the application of quantum
principles leads to incorrect results.

1 Introduction

One uses new dynamical methods of investigation, which ignore the quantum prin-
ciples. Elimination of the quantum principles admits one to eliminate the principal
problem of QFT: join of the relativity principles with the principles of quantum
mechanics. After this elimination the relativistic quantum theory is constructed on
the basis of relativistic dynamics only, whereas the conventional approach uses in
addition the linearity of dynamic equations. This linearity is based on a special
gauge of the wave function. A use of such an artiﬁcial property of the wave function
for construction of the relativistic quantum theory seems to be unjustiﬁed, although
the linearity is very convenient, because the linear equations are simple for solu-
tion. We show in the simple example of Schr¨odinger particle SS (dynamic system

1

described by the Schr¨odinger equation), that the diﬀerence between the quantum
system and the classical one is purely dynamical, and the quantum system may be
described without a reference to quantum principles.

A fundamental physical theory Tf must be a logical structure. It means, that
the theory contains a few fundamental propositions. All predictions of the theory Tf
as well as other propositions Pi intermediate between the fundamental propositions
Pf and experimental data De are deduced from the fundamental propositions Pf by
means of logical reasonings and mathematical calculations. Practical derivation of
predictions and explanations from the fundamental propositions Pf may be diﬃcult
and complicated, because of long reasonings and complicated calculations. In this
case one uses a set of intermediate propositions Pi, which are valid in some region
of physical phenomena. Practical application of the intermediate propositions Pi as
some physical theory Tc may appear to be more eﬀective and simpler, than a use of
the fundamental theory Tf.

In general, the intermediate propositions Pi are to be corollaries of the funda-
mental propositions Pf . However, if it is impossible to discover the true fundamental
propositions Pf , we may guess intermediate propositions Pi and consider them as
a curtailed physical theory Tc. The set of prescriptions Pi is chosen in such a way
to explain some set of experimental data. The curtailed theory Tc is not a logical
structure, it is simply a list of prescriptions, which are not connected logically be-
tween themselves. The logical structure appears, only if we discover and add the
fundamental propositions Pf , which generate this list of prescriptions Pi under some
conditions. In this case the intermediate propositions Pi may be eliminated from the
formulation of the fundamental theory Tf, because the propositions Pi are corollaries
of fundamental propositions Pf.

Thus, we may use the curtailed physical theory Tc instead of the fundamental
physical theory Tf. For instance, the axiomatic thermodynamics is a curtailed the-
ory with respect to kinetic theory, which may be considered to be a fundamental
theory. The conventional quantum mechanics is a curtailed theory, whereas the
corresponding fundamental theory is not known yet. Such an application of Tc is
possible only under those conditions (for instance, in the nonrelativistic case), when
the intermediate propositions Pi are valid. However, extension of the curtailed the-
ory Tc to other conditions (for instance, to the relativistical case) may appear to be
impossible, because the intermediate propositions Pi are only corollaries of the fun-
damental propositions Pf in the nonrelativistic case. Under another conditions (for
instance, in the relativistical case) the fundamental propositions Pf may generate
another intermediate propositions P ∗
i , which does not coincide with Pi and cannot
be obtained from Pi, because the set of Pi is simply a list of prescriptions (a list of
corollaries of Pf), but not a logical structure.

momentum p. We shall refer to these relations together with the restrictions imposed
on its applications as the quantum principles, because von Neumann [1] has shown,
that all proposition of quantum mechanics can be deduced from relations of this
type.

Setting ¯h = 0 in the action (2.1), we hope to obtain a description of classical
particle. Instead, the description disappears, and in this sense the description (2.1)
is artiﬁcial.

3 Natural description of the Schr¨odinger particle

To obtain the natural description of the Schr¨odinger particle, we produce the change
of variables (another gauge of the wave function phase)

ψ → Ψb : ψ = |Ψb| exp

This change of variables leads to the replacement ¯h → b and to appearance of two

ical type. One can show that the dynamic system, described by the action AScl [Ψb]
(3.5) is a partial case (irrotational ﬂow) of the dynamic system E [Sd] [2].

Connection between the Schr¨odinger equation and hydrodynamical description
is well known [3, 4]. But a connection between the description in terms of wave
function and the hydrodynamic description was one-way. One can transit from the
Schr¨odinger equation to the hydrodynamic equations, but one cannot transit from
hydrodynamic equations to the description in terms of the wave function, because
one needs to integrate hydrodynamic equations. Indeed, the Schr¨odinger equation
consists of two real ﬁrst order equations for the density ρ and the phase ϕ, whereas
the system of the hydrodynamical equations consists of four ﬁrst order equations for
the density ρ and for the velocity v. To obtain four hydrodynamic equations one
needs to take gradient of the equation for the phase ϕ. On the contrary, if we transit
from the hydrodynamic description to the description in terms of the wave function,
we are to integrate hydrodynamic equations. In the general case this integration
was not known for a long time.

Change of variables, leading from the action AE[Sd] [x] to the action AScl [Ψb] con-
tains integration (see [2] or mathematical appendices to papers [6, 7]). The constant
b in the action AScl [Ψb] is an arbitrary constant of integration (gauge constant). Ar-
bitrary integration functions are ”hidden” inside the wave function Ψb. Thus, the

4

limit of Schr¨odinger particle (3.2) at ¯h → 0 is a statistical ensemble E [Sd], but not
an individual particle Sd. It means, that the wave function describes a statistical
ensemble of particles, but not an individual particle, and Copenhagen interpretation,
where the wave function describes an individual particle, is incompatible with the
quantum mechanics formalism.

A use of Copenhagen interpretation does not generate any problems, until we
consider mathematical formalism of QM, because in the framework of this formalism
we have the only object of investigation. It is of no importance what is the name of
the investigated object. But at the consideration of the measurement we have two
diﬀerent kinds of measurement:

1. Individual measurement (S-measurement), which is produced over the indi-

vidual stochastic particle Sst.

2. Massive measurement (M-measurement), which is produced over the statisti-

cal ensemble E [Sst], or over the statistical average particle hSi.

4 Statistical ensemble as a starting point of

quantum theory

One can show, that the Schr¨odinger particle SS is a special case of the statistical
ensemble E [Sst] of stochastically moving free particles Sst, i.e. the action (3.2) for
SS can be obtained from the action for the statistical ensemble E [Sst] by means of
a proper change of variables [2].

The statistical ensemble E [Sst] of stochastic particles Sst is a dynamic system,

Hydrodynamic equations (4.6) may be written in terms of the wave function
[2, 6, 7]. The proper change of the variables together with integration turns the
action (4.1) for E [Sst] into the action containing the quantum constant ¯h and an
arbitrary integration constant b.

The wave function is not a speciﬁc quantum quantity. The wave function is a
method of description of any ideal ﬂuid. Quantum and classical dynamic systems
distinguish dynamically (by the form of their actions). The form of description (in
terms of wave function, or in terms of position and momentum of the particle) is of
no importance.

Considering the statistical ensemble of stochastic particles as a starting point of
the quantum mechanics, one does not need quantum principles, because the inter-
pretation is carried out directly via the particles of the statistical ensemble. Besides,
the quantum theory turns into a consistent statistical theory, where there are two
sorts of particles: (1) individual stochastic particle Sst and (2) statistical average
particle hSsti, which is the statistical ensemble, normalized to one particle. Formal-
ism of quantum mechanics deals only with the statistical average particle hSsti. All
predictions of QM relate only to hSsti. In accordance with two sorts of particles
we have two sorts of measurements: (1) S-measurement produced over Sst and (2)
M-measurement produced over hSsti. The two kinds of measurements have diﬀerent
properties and one may not confuse them (see for details [5]).

The Copenhagen interpretation meets the diﬃculties, when it tries to test pre-
dictions of mathematical formalism in single experiments. For instance, there exists
the problem of the mechanism of the wave function reduction at a single experi-
ment. Another problem concerns the two-slit experiment. How can an individual
particle pass through two slits at once? The physical journals publish discussions
concerning problems of quantum measurements. For instance, such a discussion was
declared in 2002 by the journal Uspekhi Fizicheskich Nauk. These problems cannot
be solved in the framework of the Copenhagen interpretation, which does not dis-
tinguish between the individual particle S and the statistically average particle hSi.
Confusion of two diﬀerent objects, having diﬀerent properties generates diﬃculties
and paradoxes. The wave function does not describe the state of individual particle
S, and it is meaningless to ask, how the wave function changes at a single measure-
ment (S-measurement). At the massive experiment (M-measurement) we obtain a
distribution F (R′) of the measured quantity R, but not a single value R′ of the

6

measured quantity. At such a situation it is useless to ask, how the obtained result
R′ inﬂuences on the the state of the statistical ensemble (statistical average par-
ticle). Finally, we may deﬁne the third type of measurement (SM-measurement):
the massive measurement of the quantity R leading to a deﬁnite value R′ of the
measured quantity R. The SM-measurement is the M-measurement leading to a
distribution F (R′), accompanied by a selection of those particles, where result of
S-measurement is R′. Uniting all particles with the measured value R′ in one sta-
tistical ensemble ER′, we can put the question about the wave function of ER′. Of
course, the wave function ψR′ of ER′ does not coincide, in general, with the initial
wave function ψ, and this change of the wave function is considered as a reduction
of the wave function. The origin of the reduction is quite transparent.
It is the
selection, which is produced to obtain the same value R′ of the measured quantity
for all particles of the statistical ensemble. Thus, the problems of reduction are con-
ditioned by the confusion of concepts of the individual particle S and the statistical
average particle hSi, which takes place at the Copenhagen interpretation (see for
details [5]).

As concerns the particle, passing through two slits simultaneously, it is a rea-
sonable property of the statistical average object. It is a pure statistical property,
which has nothing to do with quantum properties. Individual particle S can pass
either through one slit, or through another, whereas the statistical average particle
hSi can pass through both slits simultaneously. (Compare, individual person is ei-
ther a man, or a woman, whereas the statistical average person is a hermaphrodite
(half-man half-woman), and there are no quantum mechanical properties here).

Using statistical ensemble as a starting point, we can test validity the quantum
principles. The quantum principles or their conventional interpretation appear to
be wrong in some cases. For instance, the momentum distribution w (p) = |hp|ψi|2
is in reality a distribution over mean momenta hpi. Let us illustrate the diﬀerence
between the two distribution in the example of ideal gas, whose state may be de-
scribed by the wave function. In the case, when the gas moves with the constant
velocity u, the wave function has the form

ψ (x) = A1e

i

¯h mux,

A1 = const

where m is the mass of a molecule. Corresponding momentum distribution has the
form

w (p) = |hp|ψi|2 = Aδ (p − mu) ,

A = const

This distribution does not coincides with the Maxwell momentum distribution

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

which depends on the gas temperature kT .

Let us divide the space into small cells Vi and calculate the mean momentum hpii
of molecule in each cell Vi. In the given case we obtain in the ith cell hpii = mu. All
mean momenta hpii form the mean momenta distribution (4.8). The mean momenta

7

hpii correlate with the position xi of the cell Vi, and mutual distribution over position
x and momentum hpi appears to be impossible. More detail consideration one can
ﬁnd in [8].

Dynamic equations (4.12) are the partial diﬀerential equations, because ρ con-

where x = x (t, ξ), p = p (t, ξ). Dynamic equations (4.13) are ordinary diﬀerential

Describing quantum system S and corresponding classical system Scl in the clas-
sical language, we recognize that dynamic equations for the quantum system S are
partial diﬀerential equations, whereas dynamic equations for its classical approxi-
mation Scl are ordinary diﬀerential equations.

The diﬀerence between the ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations is dynam-
ical (but not quantum). This invariant diﬀerence is a foundation of the procedure
of the dynamical disquantization (transition to classical approximation).

Dynamic disquantization is the procedure of projecting of derivatives onto the

direction of 4-current jk

∂l → ∂l

|| =

jsjs

∂k,

l = 0, 1, 2, 3,

To obtain ordinary diﬀerential equations, one needs to project derivatives onto one
direction.

The dynamic disquantization admits one to formalize the transition to the clas-
sical description. Being applied to Schr¨odinger particle SS, the dynamic disquan-
tization transform SS = E [Sst] into the statistical ensemble E [Sd] of free classical
particles Sd.

8

The procedure of dynamic disquantization is determined by the dynamic system
completely and does not refer to the quantum constant and the quantum principles.

5 Concluding remarks

We have analysed application of dynamical methods to the Schr¨odinger particle and
have obtained results, which cannot be obtained by means of conventional axiomatic
methods. Analogous results are obtained at application of dynamical methods to
other quantum systems. Application of dynamical methods to investigation of quan-
tum systems admits one to eliminate quantum principles. The number of funda-
mental propositions is reduced essentially. The quantum theory ceases to be a list
of prescriptions and becomes a logical structure.

In the conventional quantum theory the allness of the quantum constant ¯h is
explained by the quantum nature of all physical phenomena. In particular, it means
that all physical ﬁelds should be quantized. Application of dynamical methods and
elimination of quantum principles suppose some primordial stochastic motion of free
particles with dependence of the stochasticity intensity on the particle mass. The
universal character of the quantum constant and the particle motion stochasticity
may be explained freely by the space-time properties, when the quantum constant
is a parameter of the space-time geometry [9, 10]. In this case not all physical ﬁelds
have the quantum nature. Dynamic equations for the metric ﬁelds (gravitational
and electromagnetic) do not contain the quantum constant ¯h. There is no necessity
to quantize these ﬁelds.

It is well known that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is absorbed and emitted in the form
of quanta of energy ¯hω. However, this fact does not mean that the electromagnetic
ﬁeld exists in the form of quanta. There are no experiments, which show directly or
indirectly that the electromagnetic ﬁeld exists in the form of quanta. (At least, such
experiments are unknown for us). Absorbtion and emission of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in the form of quanta may be easily explained by the quantum properties of
the absorbtion devices and the emission ones. The same relates to the gravitational
ﬁeld. All attempts of its quantization appear to be unsuccessful.

Quantum and classical dynamic systems distinguish only dynamically, i.e. by
their dynamic equations, but not by their enigmatic quantum properties. Linearity
of the conventional axiomatic methods is simple and attractive, but these methods
are founded on nonrelativistic quantum principles, and we cannot be sure that these
methods may be applied in the relativistic case.

There is a hope that application of dynamical methods in the relativistic case
will be successful. First, extension to the relativistic case is produced on the logical
basis, but not by means of incident hypotheses. Second, in the relativistic case the
diﬀusion velocity udf turns to the relativistic ﬁeld, responsible for pair production,
whereas neither quantum principles nor classical relativistic dynamics can describe
eﬀect of pair production, which is the principle eﬀect of the high energy physics.

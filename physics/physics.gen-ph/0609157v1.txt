Upon using the hydrodynamic analog we can derive some families of stationary Beltrami ﬁeld-

like solutions from the free Maxwell equations in vacuum. These stationary electromagnetic ﬁelds

are helical and/or column-like once they are represented in a suitable frame of reference. Possible

dendritic and jelly-ﬁsh-like patterns of sprites are demonstrated.

The majority of the great discoveries in physics have been made by chance (electromag-

netism, radioactivity, etc.) and only in some rare cases was the experiment preceded by

theory (lasers, thermonuclear reactors). It seems likely that the problem of sprites belongs

to the latter one. Since their discovery by Franz et. al. [1], sprites have now been observed

over thunderstorms all over the world [2-4]. A spectacular manifestation of these sprites
: the intense transient quasistatic electric (QE) ﬁelds of up to ∼ 1 kV · m−1, which for

positive (Cloud-to-Ground) CG discharges is directed downwards, can avalanche accelerate

upward-driven runaway MeV electron beams, producing brief (∼ 1 ms) ﬂashes of gamma

radiation. These intense ﬁelds are large luminous discharges in the altitude range of ∼ 40

km to 90 km, which are produced by the heating of ambient electrons for a few to tens of

milliseconds following intense lightning ﬂashes.

Thousands of positive ground ﬂash-sprite associations have been identiﬁed through compar-

isons with video imaging/optical sensor veriﬁcation of sprites. Beginning with suggestions

by Wilson [5], the electrostatic ﬁeld change of the lightning ﬂashwas suﬃcient to exceed

the dielectric strength of the mesosphere and initiate the sprite. This Wilson mechanism

for sprites initiated by conventional dielectric breakdown is polarity independent-positive

and negative changes in charge moment change in excess of the threshold should be equally

eﬀective in the initiation of sprites. Sprites require a lowly or nonionized medium; they can

propagate from the ionosphere downwards or from some lower base upwards or they can

emerge at some immediate height and propagate upwards and downwards [6-7].

The ﬁrst columniform sprites (c-sprites) reported [8] were vertical columns of light that ex-

tended from about 76 to 87 km and probably less than 1 km in diameter. According to

Wescott et al. [8] the uncertainty in height determination for their c-sprite measurements

was approximately 1 pixel or less than 1 km. The standard deviation of the heights for

the 28 triangulated images was 1.9 km for the top and 1.4 km for the bottom. Additional

observations of c-sprites, some of which may extend to lower altitudes, have been recently

reported [9-10]. The bodies of c-sprites usually appear as nearly straight lines, in some cases

bent slightly, and are composed of bright beads and dark regions.

Meanwhile, some researchers [7-8] described the phenomenon, called red Sprites, as a lumi-

nous column that stretches between 50 and 90 km, with peak luminosity in the vicinity of

70-80 km. The ﬂashes have an average lifetime of a few milliseconds and an optical intensity

of about 100 kR. Red Sprites are associated with the presence of massive thunderstorm

2

clouds, and among the most puzzling aspects of the observations is the presence of spatial

structure in the emissions reported by Winckler et al. [7]. Vertical striations, denominated

’tendrils’, with horizontal size of 1 km or smaller, often limited by the instrumental resolu-

tion, are apparent in the red Sprite emissions [9-10].

As one example, the key features of the previous model [9] are: (1) an ambient conductivity

proﬁle that falls between a measured nighttime and a measured daytime conductivity; (2)

an aerosol reduced conductivity in a trail from a meteor that passed through some time

during the evening, and (3) a cloud-to-ground (hereafter CG) lightning stroke, with suﬃ-

cient charge transfer, subsequent to and occurring within an hour of the development of the

reduced conductivity trail. This model predicts a temporally brief column of light resulting

from the conventional breakdown of air in a strong electric ﬁeld in the observed altitude

range. The results we shall describe in this short paper might provide an explanation for

the observed c-sprite phenomena.

The free Maxwell equations (FME) are

ǫijk∂jEk = −

ǫijk∂jBk =

c

∂Bi
∂t

,

c

∂Ei
∂t

,

∂iEi = 0,

∂iBi = 0,

where ∂i ≡ ∂/∂xi, xi = (x, y, z), ǫijk is an antisymmetric tensor or symbol. We presume

that the solutions of FME are

E(r, t) = e(r)F (t),

and

B(r, t) = b(r)G(t).

(1)

In order to obtain solutions of this system with three constants only and to obtain sinusoidal

solutions, we also presume that

−dG(t)/dt
F (t)

=

dF (t)/dt
G(t)

= Ω.

Therefore, the general solutions of above system [11] are

F (t) = C0 sin(Ωt − φ),

and

G(t) = C0 cos(Ωt − φ),

(3)

where C0 and φ are arbitrary constants. Now, equations for e and b become

(2)

(4)

∇ × e =

b,

Ω
c

∇ × b =

Ω
c

e.

3

Above equations give

∇ × A =

A,

with A = e + b,

(5)

Ω
c

where e is a polar vector (linked to the electric ﬁeld E in space, E = e F (t)), b is an axial

vector (linked to the magnetic ﬁeld B in space, B = b G(t)).

Now, from the vector analysis and the hydrodynamic analogy (e.g., for a velocity ﬁeld u, we

have the vorticity ﬁeld ω which is deﬁned as ∇ × u), we know that

(∇ × A) k A or

(∇ × A) × A = 0,

here, k means ’parallel to’. In fact, people termed L = (∇ ×A) ×A as a Lamb vector [12-13].

In generalized ﬂuid mechanics, we call the ﬂow which satisﬁes

(6)

(7)

ω × u = 0

a Beltrami ﬂow [11-14], sometimes a screw motion or helical ﬂow [11-13] (here, ω 6= 0).

With regard to these, vector ﬁelds satisfying Eq. (7) are helical or screw ﬁelds. It means A

or the combination of e and b is a helical or screw ﬁeld. One class of these solutions can be

obtained and expressed in cylindrical polar coordinates (r, θ, z) as

u = ¯A0r cos(ζ),

v = ˆΩr + ¯A0r sin(ζ),

w = −

sin(ζ),

(8)

2 ¯A0
k

where ζ = k(z −c0t) = kz −2 ˆΩt. When u = (u, ˆv, w) ≡ A is expressed in a frame of reference
rotating with the mean angular velocity ˆΩ (ˆv = ¯A0r sin(ζ)), we have ∇ × u ≡ ω = −ku or

ω ×u = 0. The stationary form of this solution could be similar to e+b (i.e., A). We remind

the readers that eqns. (8) describe a ﬁeld that grows proportionally to the distance from the
cylindrical axis. Therefore, in unbounded vacuum, as there is no dissipation, ¯A0r ∼ O(1)

as r → ∞ should be presumed otherwise they will give some non-localized electromagnetic

ﬁeld conﬁgurations with inﬁnite energy. Under this consideration, once r → ∞, w is rather
small (as ¯A0 → 0 if k is ﬁnite) and this (axial) component (related to magnetic ﬁeld; will
be illustrated below) behaves like a weak ’thread’ ! On the other hand, since ¯A0r ∼ O(1),
once r → 0, there might be a singularity at r = 0 ( ¯A0 has been restricted for very larger

r). This singularity resembles that of a free vortex (vortex core or the ﬁlament of a vortex
tube). Note that, once the amplitude ¯A0 being replaced by A(t) (with dA/dt = −νAk2, ν
plays the role of damping, the solution of above equation easily reads A(t) = A(0)e−νk2t),

4

we then have u = A(t)r cos(ζ), ˆv = A(t)r sin(ζ), w = −2A(t) sin(ζ)/k. To demonstrate

our solutions, we plot those stationary ones of them into following ﬁgures. We shall ﬁrstly
present the electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuum. Parameters are selected as ¯A0 = 0.45, k = 2.5;

the maximum spatial range : 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 2π. The vector ﬁeld is represented in
a rotating frame of reference (Fig. 1) with the mean angular velocity ˆΩ = 5.0. We can

observe the helical and the dendritic features of our solutions and the possible pattern of a

sprite-like electromagnetic ﬁeld.

The outer and inner isosurface plots (for the total modulus of A and the modulus of uir +viθ,

respectively) are presented in Fig. 1. To make sure there are also possible sprite-like ﬁelds

in our results as there are so many parameters needed for tuning and the 3D vector view is

sometimes not comprehensive, thus we only show those isosurface plots below.
With intensive searching, we can ﬁnd out, at least, for ˆΩ = 5, ¯A0 = 0.45, k = 1.5, there

exists also possible column-like together with helical ﬁeld for sprites. This pattern is shown

in Fig. 2 for the same frame of reference ( in a rotating frame of reference). The outer

(green) surface is for the total modulus of A which is already in a helical shape. The inner

(yellow) surface is for the modulus of uir + viθ which demonstrates the possible column-like
channel. As parameters are tuned into ˆΩ = 0.2, ¯A0 = 1.5, k = 2.5, the dendritic features

of sprites are illustrated clearly in Fig. 3. We can now easily capture the characteristics of

helical or possible helix-like ﬁelds in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. These results conﬁrm our present

approach (cf. images or ﬁgures in [8-9]).

Note that, once we introduce

e(r) =

[A(r) − A(−r)],

b(r) =

[A(r) + A(−r)],

(9)

considering the deﬁnition of Poynting vector S = c(E × B)/(4π), we also can obtain the rel-

evant results about S (in fact, b(r) ∝ w as evidenced from above equation). The calculation

is now only related to A(r) × A(−r) instead of e × b. Meanwhile, as the energy density W
is deﬁned as (E2 + B2)/8π, we can directly interpret W from the magnitude or modulus of

A from Eq. (8). Meanwhile, from Eqs. (8) and (9), we can obtain the explicit expression

of the electric (e(r)) and magnetic (b(r))ﬁelds. We might have, the electromagnetic energy
(|E| ∝ αγR−3
0/c2) cos(ΩR0/c))

0 , α = −(ΩR0/c) cos(ΩR0/c) + sin(ΩR0/c) and γ = α − (Ω2R2

within spheres of radius R0, which is the solution of tan(ΩR0/c) = ΩR0/c, and it is inde-

pendent on the time.

However, once we selected parameters as ˆΩ = 5, ¯A0 = 1.2, k = 0.8, a single sprite appears

(cf. Fig. 4 in [8] or Fig. 4a in [9] or Figs. 5 and 6 in [15]) which is shown in Fig. 4. The
other interesting case is for ˆΩ = 0.6, ¯A0 = 0.6, k = 0.15 as shown in Fig. 5 : a jelly-ﬁsh-like

pattern with the downward tendrils-like feature appears.

To be speciﬁc, we like to make a ﬁnal remark about the characteristic of our Beltrami ﬁelds

: Eq. (8) especially when k is rather small (solutions for k = 0 violate the Beltrami con-

dition!). Once k → 0, considering the limit of the w-component in the stationary case,

w ∝ z with z being ﬁnite. Under this situation, our solutions resemble those results for

high-electric-ﬁeld cases [15].

In a brief summary, the author likes to point out, the helical and column-like ﬁelds illustrated

above are closely linked to the formation of sprites, however, there will be other unknown,

say, relativistic, eﬀects during the ﬁnal stage in the formation of lightning. We shall consider

other more complicated problems [16-21] in our future works.

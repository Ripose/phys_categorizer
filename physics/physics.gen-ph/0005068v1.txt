I. INTRODUCTION

II. EQUATIONS FOR FIELDS ON THE BASE OF

MODIFIED RELATIONS FOR ENERGY

In the theory of multifractal time [1]- [10] for the case
when the fractional dimensions of time dt almost coincide

with integer value (equal unit) (dt = 1+P βiLi(r(t), t) =
1 + ε, |ε| << 1) was shown (see [3]) that for modifying
Lorentz transformations in the theory of fractal time it
is necessary to change factor β = p1 − v2/c2 by factor
β ∗ = 4pβ4 + 4a2

0. Then relativistic energy has form

On the base of fractal theory in this paper we presented
the new equations. These equations are analogies of rela-
tivistic equations (scalar,vector, tensor, spinor) and valid
in the domain of arbitrary velocities including speed of
light if external physical ﬁelds don’t equal zero (but so
small that fractal dimensions of time is near unit). These
equations in the case of absence of physical ﬁelds coin-
cide with the usual relativistic equations, but give the
new ﬁelds with imaginary energies (including the case of
rest energies). If the external ﬁelds are not equal zero, the
received equations give also a new spin characteristics.

Let us write formulas (1)-(2) in the form (using the hy-
pothesis about approximate conservation of the energy-
momentum vector in the space with fractal time [3])

E2 =

We introduce now the new designation for relativistic
energy and momentum similar to those that have been
used in SR (β−2 = E2E−2
0 , E = m0c2β−2) (see (2)).
Then equation without roots has form

E = m0β−1, p = m0vβ−1

The equation (8) is the base equation for describing the
energy in the space with multifractal time. For E we
receive in the absence of ﬁelds and the momentum equal
zero the four solutions:E = ±E0, E = ±iE0. Thus,
there are particles and anti-particles with real (E = ±E0)
and imaginary (E = ±iE0) masses. The last are new
sort of particles with imaginary masses. These parti-
cles are not taxions because they exist in the domain
of velocities v ≥ 0 (including velocity v = c). For
receiving equations for ﬁelds and particles we use the
ordinary method replacing the energy and the momen-
tum by derivatives. This method consists in changing
the energy E = E0/(1 − v2/c2)1/2 and the momentum
P = m0v/(1 − v2/c2)1/2 by derivatives with respect to
time and space coordinates that used in quantum me-
chanics: ¯h = c = 1, E
β → −i∇j = ˆp, (j =
1,2,3). So we obtain ( in case v ≤ c) for function Φ(r, t)
the integral -diﬀerential equation

where ˆE and ˆp are diﬀerential operators and was deter-
mined early. For simplifying this equation we multiply
it by operator (1 + 4a2
) (thou it may introduce non-

physical solutions but it is makes the equation (10)only
diﬀerential). So we obtain

where 2 is D’Alamber operator (2 = ∆ − ∂ 2

Laplasian), Φ are functions describing particles or ﬁelds.
For scalar Φ equation (10) describes the scalar ﬁeld in
the space with fractal dimensions that originated by the
presence of the external physical ﬁelds (a0 6= 0 . The cor-
rections in (11) to the usual D’Alamber equation are the
result of modifying the Lorentz transformation. The last
is consequences of fractal nature of time. For receiving
the equations in which taken into account the inﬂuence
of multifractal structure of time on using the derivatives
and receive more correct equation it is necessary to use
the generalized Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives
(GFD) [7], [1]. In that case equation (11)take the form

where Γ(x) is Euler’s gamma function, and a and b are
some constants from [0,∞). In these deﬁnitions, as usu-
ally, n = {d} + 1 , where {d} is the integer part of d
if d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤ d < n) and n = 0 for d < 0.
In this paper we don’t consider equations with fractal
derivatives and restrict consideration only by calculation
of corrections from alterations of Lorentz transformation

Now introduce the four component unit matrix I and the
Dirac type matrices αi: (α2
i = 1, αiαj + αjαi = 0, i 6= j;
i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 ). Than after usual splitting equation

where Φ is a four element bispinor column

Φ = 

(21)

In the equations (18)-(21) the ﬁrst two equations describe
the particles or ﬁelds with real energies, the last two equa-
tions describe the new particles or ﬁelds with imaginary
energies.The energies of particles with real energies de-
pends on behavior of ﬁelds with imaginary energies and
vice versa. The new spin characteristics consequences of
these equations.

IV. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER IN

DERIVATIVES

For receiving of ﬁrst order equations in derivatives
it is necessary to introduce the Dirac matrices γi (i =
0, 1, 2, 3) and Dirac type matrices σj (j = 0, 1, 2, 3).
These matrices may be used for splitting of the left-hand
side and the right-hand side of each of the equations (18)-
(21). We write the function a0 in the form

a0 = ag + ae + an = βgLg(r, t) + βeLe(r, t) +

+βnLn(r, t)

(22)

where Lg, Le, Ln are Lagrangians density of energies
for gravitational, electro-weak and strong ﬁelds. Let a
module of complex function Φi is the probability to ﬁnd
the particle in a moment t in a point r.
In that case
the square root √Φi = ψi(r, t) gives the function with
characteristics: ψ∗ψ has sense of probability. Now if
change in equations (18)-(21) the diﬀerential operators
by E and P , translate in the right-hand side of equa-
tions all members with a0 and than extract a square root
from left-hand side and right-hand side of these equa-
tions we obtain (after splitting we change E and p by

ordinary diﬀerential operators and use the designations
ψj(i) where indexes i corresponds to the indexes i at Φi
and indexes j corresponds to each splitting component

(27)

The equations (23)- (26) are generalized Dirac equations
based on taking into account only the modiﬁed by fractal
nature of time Lorentz transformations ( and possibility
of moving with speed of light as the consequences of it).
The eight equations (23) and (24) describe the particles
(or ﬁelds) with spin ¯h
2 (Φi are bispinors), real energy and
new characteristics ”quasi-spin” originated by inﬂuence
of the ﬁelds with imaginary energy. The last described
by the equations (25) and (26). Thus there are two sorts
of particles described by equations (23)-(26): with real
energies and with imaginary energies. Each sort of par-
ticles have own anti-particles and ”quasi-spin”. In these
equations taken into account the inﬂuences of all known
ﬁelds (gravitational, electro-weak, strong).

2Φµ(i) = [α1E2

∂2
∂t2 α2]Φµ(i), (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3) (28)
So there are four sorts of electro-magnetic Proca ﬁelds:
ﬁelds of Proca photons and Proca anti-photons with real
and imaginary energies and diﬀerent ”quasi-spins” . For
a0 = 0) all the equations coincide with Proca equations.

VI. MAXWELL EQUATIONS

If the Maxwell equations of electro-magnetic ﬁeld may
be considered as the equations of the Proca in the lim-
its of a rest mass equal zero, in that case the new sorts
of electro-magnetic ﬁelds (anti-photons ﬁelds and ﬁelds
with imaginary energies) as consequences of the Proca
ﬁelds appear. Let us write equations for 4-vector electro-
magnetic potentials Aµ(i) ( which are consequences of
equations (11) and (18)-(21)) for electro-magnetic ﬁelds
where role E2
0 plays 4-vector of electric current jµ, (µ =
0, 1, 2, 3)

2Aµ(i) = [α1jµ(i) + 2a0

∂2
∂t2 α2]Aµ(i), µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 (29)
In equation (29) Aµ(i) is a 4-column with respect to i.
The equations (29) are generalized Maxwell equations for
photon and anti-photon ﬁelds, with usual and ”quasi”
spins and coincide for a0 = 0 with usual Maxwell equa-
tions. The matrices α1 and α2 may be chosen for example
as

α1 = 


1 0 0
0
0 1 0
0
0 0 −1 0
0 0 0 −1




, α2 = 


0 0 0 1
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0




(30)

The last eight equations (29) describe anti-photon ﬁelds
and its energy (if electrical charges for anti-photon ﬁelds
are real) may be imaginary. In these ﬁelds the role of
minus-sign charges will play plus-sign charges and vice
versa. There are diﬀerence between speed of photons
light and anti-photons light. The speeds of photons light
and anti-photons light are equal only if a0 = 0.

VII. CONCLUSION

There are new consequences of equations based on
the modiﬁed Lorentz transformations in the multifrac-
tal time theory and now we stress it: a) the existence
of two imaginary solutions for the rest energy (iE0 and
−iE0) and thus the existence of new class of particles
with imaginary mass. Because its velocities are arbitrary
( 0 ≤ v ≤ ∞ they are not taxions ); b) the appearance of
new ”quasi-spin” characteristics. The cause of it lays in
the more high order ( four order) diﬀerential equations
then usual equations and in additional splitting of square
roots and taking into account the existence of external
ﬁelds (a0). The physical sense and physical nature of new
spin characteristics are not clear. The nature of the ad-
ditional ”spins” originated by additional decompositions
of square roots for equations of four order and physical
sense of it needs in special investigation; ; c) all equations
coincide with known physical equation if fractal dimen-
sion of time is integer ( so in that sense the theory is
not contradicts known physical theories). In the fractal

physical ﬁelds (the last originates the fractional dimen-
sions of time); d) the theory use the improved classical
relations for relativistic energy which take into attention
the fractional dimensions of time and allow motions with
arbitrary velocities (including velocities equal the speed
of light); e) it may be shown that the equations for case
v ≥ c some diﬀers at equations used in the paper but
main results the theory based on them coincide qualita-
tive with the results used in this paper(if use the equa-
tions of this paper for case v ≥ c ).
The presented in this paper the theory based on a rel-
ative motions in almost inertial systems which in turn
based on the multifractal time theory [1] and gives the
new describing for characteristics of moving bodies (en-
ergy, momentum, mass and so on). The main results
of this theory used in this paper are: a) the possibility
of moving with arbitrary velocities without appearance
of inﬁnitum energy and imaginary mass; b) existence of
maximum energy if v = c; c) possibility of experimental
veriﬁcation the main results of the theory.
The theory [1]- [10] describes the Universe as an open
systems (the theory of open systems see in [11]). This
theory coincides with SR after transition to inertial sys-
tems (if neglect by the fractional dimensions of time) or
almost coincides (the diﬀerences are non-essential) for
velocities v < c. The movement of bodies with veloc-
ities that exceed the speed of light is accompanied by
a series of physical eﬀect’s which can be found by ex-
periments (these eﬀects was considered in the separate
papers ( [3], [5], [9]) in more details). It is shown in these
papers the necessity to receive the particles with energies
∼ E0 103 1/√t and ∂
∂x ag for veriﬁcation of the
theory.If accelerate the particles by electric ﬁelds then
E0[2 ˜E(M c2)−1t]−
is the electric ﬁeld strength, M is the mass of electric
charges originated the ˜E . It is useful to pay attention
to the problem of receiving the particles with such en-
ergies of the physicians of known accelerate centers. If
the possibilities for organizing such works will be found,
the results are useful for development of our views on the
nature of an energy, the time and the space.

1.– The theme of the present Note has been already touched by me in
previous papers, passim, and treated expressly in my article “Waves and
uniformity of space-times” [1]. However, it has not attracted the attention
of the concerned scholars and therefore I give here a little diﬀerent treatment
of the problem with some further illustration.

2.– The spacetime of special relativity (SR) is usually described by the
simple Minkowskian tensor ηjk, (j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3), for which: ηrs = 0 if

the Galilean reference frames are physically privileged. As far back as 1917,
it was emphasized by Kretschmann [2] – and in subsequent years by Fock
[3] – that any physical theory can be reformulated in general co-ordinates
without losing its characteristic physical properties. In the case of SR, this
means in particular that the Galilean frames maintain their physical pri-

vileges; see e.g. chapt.
relativity (GR) things stand otherwise: a pregnant formulation by Erwin
Schr¨odinger [4] tells us that: “The geometric structure of the space-time
model envisaged in the 1915 theory [GR] is embodied in the following two
principles: (i) equivalence of all four-dimensional systems of coordinates ob-
tained from any one of them by arbitrary (point-)transformations; (ii) the
continuum has a metrical connexion impressed on it: that is, at every point
a certain quadratic form of the coordinate-diﬀerentials, gikdxidxk, called
the ’square of the interval’ between the two points in question, has a funda-
mental meaning, invariant in the aforesaid transformations.

Relativity.” In other terms, in GR no system of co-ordinates has physical
privileges. Seemingly, this concept has been accepted by the overwhelming
majority of physicists (with the remarkable exception represented by Fock).
However, I wish to emphasize that not all theoreticians have realized all its
implications.

3.– Point (i) of the above Schr¨odinger’s quotation means that the phrase
“General Relativity” must be understood literally: no reference system has
physical privileges, no physically sensible result depends on the chosen co-
ordinates. In any speciﬁc instance one chooses of course the reference frame
that is the most adequate and simple for geometric and formal reasons,
avoiding the introduction of superﬂuous “inertial forces” (lato sensu), which
would complicate uselessly the computations. The choice of the reference
system has only a practical meaning because in GR the co-ordinates are
mere labels for the point-events of spacetime.

A ﬁrst important consequence: no fundamental velocity exists in GR,
in particular light loses a privilege that it had in SR: now, its propagation
speed depends on the inertial-gravitational forces, and can vary from zero
to inﬁnity.

Fock [3] did not share Einstein’s standpoint on reference systems. For
him only the special theory (SR) deserves the name of “theory of relativity”.
(From a strictly geometrical viewpoint, “relativity” and “uniformity” of the
concerned manifold – see infra, sect.4. – are closely related concepts, as it
was emphasized in 1927 by E. Cartan.) Fock tried to demonstrate that in
GR – called by him “theory of gravitation” – there exists a set of inﬁnite
reference frames endowed with an outstanding signiﬁcance, the harmonic
frames. However, his proof rests on unjustiﬁed assumptions and therefore
is not a real proof. As a matter of fact, the harmonic references are useful
for the practical solution of many problems, but do not possess a particular
conceptual value.

As it is well known, the harmonic co-ordinates, say ξj, are such that the
components gjk’s, (j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3), of metric tensor satisfy the following
four conditions (k = 0, 1, 2, 3) [5]:

where g := det

. According to Fock [5], the ξ’s are especially appro-
priate for evidencing in various stages of approximation the mathematical
properties of the GW’s. In Fock’s conception, the fact that the undulatory
character of gravitational wavy motions remains unchanged for all the har-
monic frames is suﬃcient to make certain the physical reality of the GW’s.
Now, two fundamental remarks can be opposed to Fock. In primis, no physi-
cal “mechanism” exists really in the exact GR for the production of GW’s;
in particular, it is easy to prove that the trajectories of the bodies of a sy-
stem, which interact only gravitationally, are geodesic lines [6]. Accordingly,
even if we adopted Fock’s conception, the GW’s would reveal themselves as

RELATIVITY AND WAVY MOTIONS

In secundis, since the correct interpretation of
mere analytical artefacts.
the formalism of Einstein’s ﬁeld theory aﬃrms that the phrase “General
Relativity” must be taken au pied de la lettre [4], we can ascertain imme-
diately that the undulatory character of any GW is generally impaired by
a change of general co-ordinates. Further, the GW’s have only a pseudo
stress-energy-momentum tensor.

4.– It is instructive to compare the e.m. waves with the GW’s. The propa-
gation substrate of the e.m. waves of Maxwell theory is Minkowski space-
time, that is a uniform (i.e., homogeneous and isotropic) manifold, for which
the inﬁnite class of the Galilean frames is physically privileged. When we
re-write Maxwell theory according to the formalism of Riemann-Einstein
spacetime, the “physicality” of its concepts remains unchanged, in particu-
lar the “physicality” of the e.m. waves. On the contrary, the GW’s are
undulations of the metric tensor gjk, which is the “substance” of Riemann-
Einstein spacetime, i.e. of a not “ﬁxed” manifold, that does not possess
a class of physically privileged reference systems. Emission “mechanism”
of the e.m. waves can be simply the acceleration of a charge, whereas the
acceleration of a mass does not generate any GW [6]. (For the special case
of the GW’s in the linear approximation of GR, see sect.8 infra.)

5.– Characteristic hypersurfaces of Einstein ﬁeld equations: in the current
literature there is a physically false interpretation of them.

They were ﬁrst written in 1930 by Levi-Civita [7], who gave the correct

interpretation.

In SR the diﬀerential equations of the characteristics and of the bicha-
racteristics of Maxwell ﬁeld can be written respectively, in a Hamilton-Jacobi
form, as follows:

(2)

(3)

H :=

ηjkpjpk = 0 ,

∂yj

;

dpj
dσ

−

,

dyj

=

where: σ is an auxiliary parameter, z(y) is the function which deﬁnes
the characteristic hypersurface z(y) = 0, and ds2 = ηjkdyjdyk yields the
(y0, y1, y2, y3)], represents
Minkowskian interval. Equation z(y) = 0, [y
physically the wave front of an e.m. wave; the characteristic lines of (2)
– the rays of wave front z(y) = 0, given by eq.(3) – coincide with the null
geodesics ds = 0. Thus we see that SR comprises the geometric optics.
(This could be foreseen because the e.m. theory is a basic ingredient for
deﬁning space and time in SR.)

Eqs. (2) and (3) can be immediately re-written in a system of general

co-ordinates (x0, x1, x2, x3)

Now, as it was demonstrated by Whittaker [8], eqs.

(4) and (5) are
formally identical to the equations that yield characteristics and bicharacte-
ristics of Maxwell ﬁeld in a Riemann-Einstein spacetime with metric tensor
gjk(x). And Levi-Civita [7] proved that eqs. (4) and (5) give also characte-
ristics and bicharacteristics of Einstein ﬁeld. A not fortuitous coincidence!
Since GR comprehends SR, eqs. (4) and (5) have a unique electro-
magnetic interpretation for Maxwell and Einstein ﬁelds, as it was explicitly
emphasized by Levi-Civita [7]: both SR and GR comprise constitutionally
the geometric optics.

On the contrary, in the current opinion (see e.g. Fock [3], sect.53) cha-
racteristics and bicharacteristics of Einstein ﬁeld equations give wave fronts
and rays of GW’s: an interpretation vitiated by the wishful thinking con-
cerning the real existence of these ﬁctive undulations.

6.– We have seen that both in SR and in GR equation ds2 = 0 gives the
geodesic null lines that represent the light rays of geometric optics. The
propagation velocity of these rays is not a universal constant in GR, be-
cause it depends on the inertial-gravitational forces as described by poten-
tial gjk(x). A simple example will render evident this well known fact; see
also [9].

Let us consider the ds2 of Brillouin’s form of solution of Schwarzschild
problem (: to ﬁnd the gravitational ﬁeld generated by a material point of
mass M , at rest) [10]:

which is obtained from the standard form of solution of Schwarzschild
problem (erroneously called “by Schwarzschild”). Brillouin’s form [6] is
diﬀeomorphic to “exterior” part r > 2m of standard form: a simple fact
that makes clear how the notion of black hole pertain to a fairy-tale. (The
baroque form of solution by Kruskal and Szekeres is a gift of Barmecide).

6bis.– The singularities in GR: they are classiﬁable in two mathematical
categories: curvature singularities and co-ordinate singularities. However,
from the physical standpoint the only essential distinction is between sin-
gularities characterized by the presence in them of matter and singularities
characterized by the absence in them of matter. The two classiﬁcations do
not always coincide. For instance, the singularity of the Brillouin’s form
(6) and the singularity of the original Schwarzschild’s form (which can
be obtained, e.g., from the standard form by means of formal substitution
[r3 + (2m)3]1/3) are not curvature singularities, but physical ones. On
r
the contrary, the singularity at r = 0 of the standard form is a curvature
singularity, but it cannot represent a material point because is a space-like
locus; and the singularity at r = 2m of the standard form is a co-ordinate
and non-physical singularity.

→

A widespread “Vulgate” of GR aﬃrms that if Schwarzschild problem is
solved using co-ordinate-free methods (as orthonormal bases, etc.) the result
is necessarily the standard form of solution. Unfortunately, “Vulgate”’s
procedure is impaired by a logical fallacy: indeed, these authors have already

6

ANGELO LOINGER

chosen initially the above form because they write, ﬁrst of all, the simple
expression r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2) for the angular part. Et de hoc satis.

7.– There is a widespread and erroneous conviction (see e.g. Fock [3], p.194)
according to which in GR gravitation is propagated with the speed of light
in vacuo, i.e. with the speed of light in empty space of SR.

The supporters of this false opinion claim that it follows, e.g., from eqs.
(4) and (5), when interpreted as diﬀerential equations of wave fronts and
rays of GW’s. Now, this is trivially wrong even from the viewpoint of the
believers in the physical existence of GW’s, because eqs. (4) and (5) – quite
independently of their interpretation – aﬃrm in reality that the concerned
wave fronts and rays have a propagation velocity that depends on the metric
tensor gjk(x), even if this tensor has the form of a mathematical undulation.
The non-existence of physical GW’s has the following consequence:
if
we displace a mass, its gravitational ﬁeld and the related curvature of the
interested manifold displace themselves along with the mass: under this
respect Einstein ﬁeld and Newton ﬁeld behave in an identical way [11].

For the GW’s in the linear approximation of GR, see sect.8.

8.– The case of the GW’s according to linear approximation of GR can be
quickly dispatched.
Indeed, it is here suﬃcient that I recall the decisive
argument of sect.4 of a recent paper of mine [12].

As it is well known, in the linearized version of GR one puts approximately

(12)

gjk ≈

ηjk + hjk
where ηjk is the customary Minkowskian tensor and the hjk’s are small
deviations, that in our case represent the passage of GW’s. The essential
point is: hjk is a tensor only under Lorentz transformations of Galilean
co-ordinates.

,

Now: α) suitable ﬁnite transformations of general co-ordinates can re-
duce to zero the undulations hjk, just because their tensorial character is
only Lorentzian; β) for the specially signiﬁcant instance of plane GW’s, re-
mark α) implies the reduction to zero of the celebrated transverse-traceless
(TT) GW’s; γ) it is true that in Minkowski space-time the hjk–waves are
propagated with the light velocity c in vacuo; unfortunately, by virtue of α)
and β), they are only phantom entities.

It is regrettable that various physicists insist on publishing useless consi-
derations and computations on hjk–waves [13]. It is time that astrophysical
community desist from beating the air – and from squandering the money
of the taxpayers.

Appendix: Levi-Civita, Einstein and the GW’s

I don’t doubt that Levi-Civita’s electromagnetic interpretation of the cha-
racteristics of Einstein ﬁeld [7] was propitiated by his fundamental memoir
i)
of 1917 on GR [14].
the proposed pseudo tensor tjk of stress-energy-momentum of Einstein ﬁeld,
which satisﬁes the diﬀerential conditions (Tjk is the matter tensor)

Indeed, this paper ends with two basic remarks:

(13)

∂ [(tk

j )√

g ]

−

= 0 ,

is just a false tensor, that can be reduced to zero with a suitable change of
co-ordinates; ii) from the geometrical and analytical standpoint, it is certain
(1/2)gjkR] represents
that the left-hand side of Einstein equations [Rjk −
the true stress-energy-momentum tensor of Einstein ﬁeld – as it had been
pointed out also by Lorentz [15].

Quite independently , point i) and point ii) tell us that the GW’s
(which are solutions of Rjk = 0) are mere mathematical, not physical, un-
dulations, both in the exact GR and in the linear approximation of it.

There was a gentleman’s disagreement between Einstein and Levi-Civita.
Against point ii) Einstein raised an intuitive, “sentimental”, objection,
which represents an implicit dissatisfaction with the formal structure of his
theory: with the proposal by Levi-Civita and Lorentz, the total energy of
a closed system is always zero, and the conservation of this value does not
imply the further existence of the physical system under any whatever form.
Point i): in Pauli’s and in Weyl’s treatises [16] we ﬁnd the various stra-
tagems (by several authors) having the aim to prove that under convenient
spatio-temporal asymptotic conditions the integrals

(14)

give the conserved total four-momentum of a closed physical system. Now,
one can remark that it is conceptually inappropriate to circumvent a pro-
perty of the diﬀerential formalism by prescribing ad hoc conditions to given
integrals; besides, an ineﬀective procedure, for the following reason. As
Lorentz [15] and Klein [17] pointed out, there are other quantities – say
wjk, diﬀerent from the above tjk –, which satisfy the same conditions, in
particular such that

(15)

;

the w’s by Lorentz and Klein depend also on the second derivatives of
gjk, but this does not violate any physical principle. Now, the value of the
corresponding total four-momentum does not coincide with the value given
by eqs. (14).

Of course, Einstein was perfectly aware that results of the kind (14) are
only a provisional way out; and on the other hand he thought that the entire
GR is only a provisional theory!

ANGELO LOINGER

So far as the GW’s are concerned, he was always doubtful about their
physical existence; a careful reading of his lucid paper of 1937 with N. Rosen
[18] is enlightening. And in his beautiful booklet The Meaning of Relativity
no mention is made of the gravitational waves [19].

A last remark on these waves. Considering the total failure of all expe-
rimental attempts to reveal them, some physicists have recently revived –
in private correspondences – an old conjecture: even if the GW’s really
existed, it would be impossible to detect them, because the spatio-temporal
deformation induced by the passage of a GW would interest both the appara-
tuses, i.e. the resonant bar or the Michelson interferometer, and the devices
that register resp. the bar vibrations or the geodesic deviation of the sus-
pended mirrors of the interferometer. In this second case it is necessary to
take into account the interaction of the GW with the light beams in the in-
terferometric arms [20], because it gives a modiﬁcation of the displacement
of the interference fringes generated by the above geodesic deviation.

Parergon

The readers of Number 27 (Spring 2006) of newsletter Matter of Gravity
[21] can see that the astrophysicists of the “main stream” are far from a
proper understanding of the repeated experimental failures for detecting
GW’s and BH’s.

The research brief “Recent progress in binary black hole simulations”
contains a very peculiar assertion: since the BH’s have singularities which
can represent a hard obstacle for numerical simulations, Pretorius Group
“uses black hole excision, whereby the black hole interior is removed from
the computational grid. This is justiﬁed since the event horizon disconnects
the interior causally from the exterior.” Clearly, these scholars have not
realized that the event horizon (the singularity at r = 2m) is the essence of
the (ﬁctive) notion of BH. BH-excision amounts to substitute the standard
form of solution of Schwarzschild problem with, e.g., Brillouin’s form [10] or
Schwarzschild’s (original) form, that are diﬀeomorphic to the exterior part
(r > 2m) of the standard form – and are maximally extended.

The briefs entitled resp. “What’s new in LIGO” and “LISA Pathﬁnder”
describe the continuous reﬁnements of the apparatuses, and declare impli-
citly a great optimism about the results of future searches: the detection of
the GW’s is now behind the corner.

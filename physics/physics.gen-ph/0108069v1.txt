A derivation of the homogenous Maxwell equations

We present a theoretical derivation of the homogenous Maxwell equations, based on Stokes

theorem for Minkowski space tensors.

The Maxwell equations (1)-(2) for the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the Lorentz 4-force law (3) for a charged particle
are generalizations based on the experiments on the forces between electric charges and currents. These equations
can be written in the covariant form1,2

where x is the position 4-vector, J is the 4-current, F is the 4-force, U is the 4-velocity, and F is the antisymmetric
ﬁeld-strength tensor.

These equations are intimately related with the principles of special relativity.

Indeed, it was the consistent
treatment of the electrodynamics of moving bodies that led to relativity3. Tolman4 and Jeﬁmenko5 have derived the
Lorentz force law from the Maxwell equations and special relativity. Frisch and Wilets6 have derived the Maxwell
equations and the Lorentz force law by applying the transformations of special relativity to Gauss’s law of the ﬂux of
the electric ﬁeld. Dyson7 reproduces an argument due to Feynman, in which Maxwell equations follow from Newton’s
law of motion and the quantum mechanics commutation relations. It is remarkable how nonrelativistic assumptions
can lead to relativistically invariant equations. In this paper we derive the homogenous Maxwell equations by using
Stokes theorem, in a fully relativistic manner.

II. DERIVATION OF THE HOMOGENOUS MAXWELL EQUATIONS

A consequence of the antisymmetry of the ﬁeld-strength tensor is that the magnitude imoc of the 4-momentum p is
constant. We will consider an extension of the Lorentz 4-force law to the case of a ﬁeld-strength tensor not necessarily
antisymmetric. Consequently the rest mass mo of the test particle will no longer be constant, but the electric charge
will not be modiﬁed. We will require that the rest mass form a scalar ﬁeld, since it is unphysically to assume that the
rest mass of a particle at a given SpaceTime point might depend on the history of that particle. This is the underlying
physical principle behind the homogenous Maxwell equations. The real-world situation is obviously a special case of
this more general theory, limited to an antisymmetric ﬁeld-strength tensor.

Consider two SpaceTime events A and B, and a charged test particle moving from A to B on any possible smooth
path Γ, restricted only to the condition that the initial and ﬁnal velocities be given. Since at A and B the direction of
the 4-momentum is given, and the magnitude of the 4-momentum is also unique, we can conclude that the variation
of the 4-momentum between A and B is the same regardless of the path followed. For two diﬀerent paths, Γ1 and Γ2,
we can write

By collecting the integrals in (4) on one side, and using (5), we obtain that in general

Stokes theorem, usually used in connection with the null circulation of a vector, will now be applied for the more

general case of a tensor. Stokes theorem in the 4-dimensional Minkowski-space takes the form8

where dfβγ are projections of a surface element. Due to the arbitrary nature of the paths Γ1 and Γ2, from equations
(6)-(7) it follows that

This is the most general condition that the ﬁeld-strength tensor must satisfy. We separate the symmetric and the
antisymmetric components in (8), obtaining

From (9) we obtain two more equations by cyclic permutations of the indices (α → β, β → γ, γ → α). By summing
up all the three equations the symmetric components cancel, and we end up with the homogenous Maxwell equations

Due to the nonmetrical nature of Stokes theorem9, this derivation of the homogenous Maxwell equations will work

in general relativity too.

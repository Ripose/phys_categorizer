Abstract:
This work is a next stage of development of the Uniﬁed model of Bivac-
uum, [corpuscle (C) ⇋ wave (W )] duality, electromagnetism and gravita-
tion (Kaivarainen, 1993; 1995; 2000; 2001a). The coherent formula, uniﬁed
the pace of kinetic energy change (dTk/Tk) of any closed system with its elec-
tromagnetic (dEel/Eel), gravitational (dEG/EG) energies and temporal ﬁeld
(dt/t) relative changes, has been obtained:

[d ln t = −d ln Eel = −d ln EG = −d ln Tk]x,y,z

The spatial anisotropy of all of these parameters are determined by anisotropy

of impulse space and kinetic energy distribution:

. The

quantum hidden roots of Golden mean are revealed. It is shown, that realiza-
tion of Principle of least action could be a consequence of ”Harmonization
force (HF)” of Bivacuum fundamental oscillation, driving evolution of hierar-
chical systems to Golden mean condition. The nonlocal interaction (quantum
entanglement) between particles of the in-phase [C ⇋ W ] pulsations occurs
because of Bivacuum symmetry oscillation, accompanied these pulsations.

1 Introduction: New model of Bivacuum

The model of Bivacuum is a result of new interpretation of Dirac’s
theory, pointing to equal probability of positive and negative energy (Dirac,
1958). We deﬁne Bivacuum, as a dynamic matrix of the Universe with su-
perﬂuid and nonlocal properties, composed from non mixing microscopic sub-
quantum particles of the opposite energies. The meso - structure of Bivacuum
is presented by inﬁnitive number of three-dimensional (3D) double cells, each
cell containing a pair of correlated rotors and antirotors: ( V +) and ( V −) of

Each of rotor and antirotor is a result of collective excitation of sub-
quantum particles and antiparticles in realms of positive and negative vac-
uum. The rotors (V+) and antirotors (V−) form diﬀerent kinds of dipoles:
mass, electric and magnetic. They carry equal by absolute value, but oppo-
, electric charges |e+| = |−e−|
site by signs virtual mass
and magnetic moments |µ+| = |−µ−| . Consequently, the primordial Bi-
(cid:12)
in the absence of matter and ﬁelds) on macroscopic scale is
vacuum (i.e.
(cid:12)
a neutral medium with resulting energy, mass, spin, charge, mag-
netic moment - equal to zero, due to zero symmetry shift. It is ﬁlled
with inﬁnitive number of double vorticity excitations (cells-dipoles): bivac-
uum fermions and antifermions with positive and negative half-integer
spins: (BV F ↑
S=−1/2 = V+ (cid:21) V−), corre-
sponding to the opposite, but in-phase circulation of rotors and antirotors.
From condition of the resulting spin of Bivacuum, equal to zero it follows
that the total number of BV F ↑
S=−1/2 should be equal.
The intermediate transition state between bivacuum fermions of opposite
spins with antiphase (V+) and (V−) rotation represents bivacuum boson
(BV B±

spin:

Bivacuum bosons have a properties of Falaco soliton in description of

Kiehn (1998).

The double cells of BV F l

S=±1/2 and BV B±
S=0 with external impulse, equal
to zero, can be considered as a virtual molecules of Bivacuum, forming Vir-
tual Bose Condensate (VirBC) with nonlocal properties (Kaivarainen, 2000,

2

2001). The excitation of massless magnon-like spin waves is possible due to
spontaneous violation of dynamic equilibrium (1.2).

The origination and annihilation of virtual particles (V P +) and antipar-
ticles (V P −) is a result of transitions between higher and lower excitation
states (j and k) of rotors and antirotors in positive and negative compart-
ments of double cells. These quantized transitions are responsible for Virtual
Pressure (V P +) and (V P −) oscillation:

A spatial image of the wave [W] phase, in form of cumulative virtual

2.1 Conservation Rules for sub-Elementary Particles, as Magnetic
and Electric Dipoles

Bohm has demonstrated, that the theorem of von Neumann (1955), claim-
ing to show the absence of hidden variables, is based on assumptions, making
his proof non satisfactory (Bohm, 1987; Bohm & Hiley, 1993). So, the exis-
tence of hidden parameters in quantum systems is possible.

Two internal conservation rules, responsible for stability of sub-elementary

particles and antiparticles (fermions and bosons), forming elementary parti-
cles, are postulated in our Uniﬁed Model (UM):

I. Conservation of the actual (measurable) and complementary (hidden)
internal kinetic energies of vortex and rotor, correspondingly in form of equal-
ity of modules of actual
kinetic energy
to the total rest mass energy (m0c2) of sub-elementary particle, as a mass-

The logic of our Uniﬁed model demands the exchange of conventional no-
tations of negative and positive charge for electron and positron or fermions
and antifermions in general case, deﬁned by actual mass of uncompen-
sated sub-elementary fermion. From the left part of (2.4) we can see,
that the internal actual charge (e+) and actual magnetic moment (µ+) of
sub-elementary particle of the electron with positive actual mass (m+
C) is
convenient to deﬁne as ”positive”. For the other hand the uncompensated
sub-elementary antifermion of the positron with actual mass (m−
C) is nat-
ural to consider as a carrier of ”negative” internal charge (e−) and the
internal negative magnetic moment (µ−). Consequently, the result-
ing, experimentally measurable, charges of the electron and positron
from (2.11a) are deﬁned, correspondingly, as:

e+ = +e = +

[e±]2

and

e− = −e = −

[e±]2

(2.12)

It is evident, that such convenient for our presentation exchange of nota-
tions of charge of particles (e+) and antiparticles (e−) is not aﬀecting the
conventional theories of classical and quantum electrodynamics in any way.
We can suppose, that the actual charge ( e+), but not the resulting one

is a measurable in experiment value, like the actual mass ( m+

Each of sub-elementary fermion (F ↑ and F ↓) and sub-elementary boson

dipole simultaneously.

It is important to note, that positive (2.1) and negative (2.1a) Bivac-
uum symmetry shift is accompanied by sub-elementary particles and sub-
elementary antiparticles origination, correspondingly.

For sub-elementary particles such characteristics as: mass: m+
Cvin

C = m0/[1−

For sub-elementary antiparticles the notions of actual and complementary
characteristics change their place. The mass of negative realm of Bivacuum
became actual and measurable: m−

(e−) and magnetic moment: µ− = e− ~/(m+

Each of excessive standing sub-elementary particles: F+ and F− in quark

electron-positron structure of quarks is formed by sub-elementary particles/antiparticles
of [µ and/or τ ] generation, much heavier, than [e] − generation.

(cid:9)

In our model, the proton (Z = +1):

p = [2u + d]µ,τ

(2.18)

contains more standing sub-elementary fermions (12F+), than that sub-
elementary antifermions (9F−). Each proton contains three excessive stand-
ing sub-elementary fermions F+. The resulting spin and charge of proton is
equal and opposite to that of the electron.

The neutron:

n = [d + 2u]µ,τ

(2.19)

is composed from the equal number of standing excited sub-elementary

The symmetry of our bivacuum as respect to probability of elementary
particles and antiparticles origination, makes it principally diﬀerent from
asymmetric Dirac’s vacuum (1958), with its realm of negative energy satu-
rated with electrons. Positrons in his model represent the ’holes’, originated
as a result of the electrons jumps in realm of positive energy. Currently it
becomes clear, that the Dirac’s model of vacuum is not general enough to
explain all know experimental data, for example, the bosons emergency.

3 Duality as a Result of Quantum Beats Between
Actual and Complementary States of sub-Elementary
Particles

Duality of elementary particles and antiparticles in accordance to Uniﬁed
model, is a consequence of coherent quantum beats of their sub-elementary
particles/antiparticles between two states: the asymmetrically excited state
(BV F l)∗ ≡ F±

l and its symmetric state (BV F l):

CV C
⇋ BV F l

F±
l

(3.1)

These beats are accompanied by [emission ⇋ absorption] of cumulative
virtual cloud (CVC) of sub-quantum particles, representing [W] phase of
sub-elementary particle.

As far the energy of BV F l is equal to zero, it means that the energy
l ] is equal to

of corpuscular [C] phase, in form of sub-elementary particle [F±
energy of the wave [W] phase, in form of [CVC]: EC = EW .

The energy of quantum beats in a course of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of sub-
elementary particle is equal to diﬀerence between the absolute values of actual
(vortex) and complementary (rotor) states. Using eqs. (2.8 and 2.8a), we
get the energy of sub-elementary de Broglie wave in [C] and [W] phase:

Bivacuum fermions (BVFl). The binding of CVC to the anchor BVFl, cor-
responds to [C] phase restoration. In general case elementary fermion in [C]
phase moves with group velocity (v), lower than luminal one (c), pertinent
for [W ] phase. Such jump-way process of particle propagation in space may
be termed KANGAROO EFFECT [KE].

↑ ⊲⊳ F−

The propagation of symmetrical pair [F+

↓ ] of the electron/positron
is realized in form of [emission ⇋ absorption] of positive (VPW+) and nega-
tive (VPW−) virtual pressure waves, accompanied their in-phase [C ⇋ W ]
pulsation. This dynamic wave process is correlated with ’jumps’ of uncom-
pensated [F−
l i in space and time. The most probable length of ’jumps’ is
determined by actual part of de Broglie wave (wave B) length of particle:
λ+ = h/m+
Cv. The hidden characteristic dimension of [C] and [W] phase
of sub-elementary particle: λ± = h/(
Cv(v/c)]. Con-
sequently, the ratio of CVC dimension (amplitude) to the wave B length

(3.10)

Propagation of the photon in bivacuum has luminal velocity in both

phase: [W] and [C] due to symmetry of this elementary boson structure.

Our UM has some similarity with theory, developed by Krasnoholvets
(2000). He regarded a vacuum also as a cellular space, each cell being ﬁlled
either by ’superparticle’ or by corpuscle. Propagation of particle in vacuum
is accompanied by the emergence of elementary excitations of vacuum - in-
ertons, surrounding the particle. Interesting to note, that in his model the
ratio of the inertons cloud amplitude to the length of wave B of particle is
the same, as (3.4).

4. The Relation Between the External and Internal
(Hidden) Parameters

From (2.3; 2.9 - 2.11) the formula for uniﬁcation of the internal (vin

5 Inﬂuence of Bivacuum’s Harmonization Force on
Matter Dynamics and Spatial Organization.

Harmonization force (HF), in accordance to our theory, is related to
induced resonance between Bivacuum virtual pressure waves (VPW±)
with fundamental frequencies (ω0 = m0c2/~)e,µ,τ (see eqs.1.1 and 1.1a), and
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation of symmetric pairs [F +

particles of matter. Due to strong correlation between dynamics of compen-
sated [F +
l ]e,µ,τ and uncompensated [F ± >e,µ,τ sub-elementary parti-
cles/antiparticles, forming particles, the external Bivacuum pressure oscil-
lations of Golden mean frequencies [(j − k)ωi

mean conditions.

The resonant energy exchange between interacting elements of nonlinear
systems with many degrees of freedom, i.e. between nuclears and electrons,
atoms and molecules may occur under the inﬂuence of HF. The energy ex-
change between diﬀerent degrees of freedom of matter with Bivacuum at
combinational resonance conditions may induce ﬁnally even the acceler-
ation of macroscopic bodies.
It happens, if the amplitude of virtual
pressure waves (VPW±) and asymmetry of virtual pressure of positive and
negative vacuum: ∆V P ± = |V P + − V P −| are big enough. Such eﬀects may
be achieved, as a result of ampliﬁcation of VPW±, frequency and uncompen-
sated density energy by the whirled magnetic ﬁeld, generated by magnetized
rotating body. This could be the explanation of Searl eﬀect, conﬁrmed by de
Palma, Baurov and Ogarkov (1994), Roshin and Godin (2000).

Except the deﬁnite relations between the frequency of external and in-
ternal frequencies (5.4a), the resonant excitation of system (matter) needs
certain geometrical conditions, providing the certain phase shift between Bi-
vacuum and matter oscillations. The latter means that optimization of com-
binational resonance interaction of BvO with macromolecules, like DNA,
proteins and other ”ﬂexible” systems, direct the evolution of such systems
geometry to Golden mean conditions.

Such directed inﬂuence of Bivacuum oscillations, i.e. Harmonization Force,
on properties of elementary particles, atoms and molecules, aﬀecting, in turn,
the dynamics and geometry of macroscopic systems and their evolution -
could be a physical background of Principle of Least Action.

It is important to note that the ﬁnal goal of self-organization and Evo-
lution, corresponding to fulﬁlment of Golden mean conditions on the all hi-
erarchical levels of matter, diﬀers from state of maximum of entropy and
”Thermal Death” of the Universe, predicted by classical thermodynamics.

The feedback reaction between dynamics of Bivacuum and particles of
matter is a crucial consequence of our [C ⇋ W ] duality model. Modulation
of the high frequency [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of elementary particles by low fre-
quency coherent thermal vibrations of atoms and molecules determines the
frequency, phase and amplitude of the nonlocal Bivacuum symmetry oscil-
lations (BvSO). The luminal Virtual Pressure Waves: VPW+ and VPW− of
positive and negative vacuum, correspondingly, representing density oscilla-
tions of virtual particles (VP+) and antiparticles (VP−), are modulated by
BvSO, generated by matter. Superposition of modulated standing VPW+
and VPW− forms the Virtual Replica (VR) of matter with properties of
quantum hologram (Kaivarainen,2001d).

Our understanding of time, based on eq.(6.4), leads to deﬁnition: ”Time
for any closed nonequilibrium or oscillating physical system is a parame-
ter, characterizing the pace of this system kinetic energy (mass and velocity)
change”(Kaivarainen, 2000; 2001). This means that Hierarchy of closed sys-
tem - from the molecule to Universe determines the corresponding hierarchy
of time-scales.

E t = ~

18

Increasing the external velocity of system, accompanied by increasing of
its kinetic energy, corresponds to decreasing of pace of time in total accor-
dance with special theory of relativity.

In accordance to our model, the characteristic time for any closed system
(ti), including the Universe, is positive if the kinetic energy, including the
actual mass of this system Mi and its velocity is decreasing and negative in
the opposite case:

ti = −

Tkin
dTkin/dt

= −

d ln Tkin/dt

(6.7)

It is important to note, that the entropy of system increasing with tempera-
ture is accompanied by the increasing of kinetic energy of its elements/particles.
Consequently, in accordance to our approach, dissipation and disorganization
of system mean negative course of time. For the other hand, decreasing of
kinetic energy of particle with temperature decreasing, usually mean increas-
ing of its potential energy of interaction with each other, leading to particles
association and Bose condensation.

We may conclude, that time is positive for selected condensed matter sys-
tem, if this system is tending to self-organization and evolution, decreasing
its internal kinetic energy and increasing potential energy. In the opposite
case time for this system is negative. In other words, decreasing of entropy
means positive course of time and increasing - the negative course of time.
This conclusion is in accordance with Prigogin’s concept of time.

The future states of any system, in the absence of strong external inﬂuence
of matter and ﬁelds, may be anticipated, as a stages of evolving of its dynamic-
spatial parameters to Golden mean conditions, under Harmonization driving
Force of Bivacuum.

7 Calculation of Magnetic Moment of the Electron,
Based on Uniﬁed Model

We assume, that the actual magnetic moment of the electron (µe) is
deﬁned by its actual charge (e+), enhanced a little due to relativist ef-
fects, generated by zero-point oscillation and corresponding external velocity
(v = v0 > 0):

then, using (4.1), for the ratio of µe

we derive:

µe = (e+)0

It is shown, that the group velocity of particle (v0), corresponding to zero
point oscillation, is deﬁned by new dimensionless zero point factor (z),
introduced in our Uniﬁed model (UM):

z = (αφ)1/2 = v0/c = 0.067156608

(7.3)

where: α = e2/~c = 0.0072973506 is electromagnetic ﬁne structure

constant and φ = (vφ/c)2 = 0.6180339887 is a Golden mean.

The magnetic moment of the electron, calculated using our analytical
expressions (7.2 and 7.3) at zero-point condition (µU M = 1.001131 µB) co-
incides with experimental (µexp = 1.001159 µB) very well. The small diﬀer-
ence may be a consequence of screening of the electron’s charge by virtual
electron-positron pairs. The latter eﬀect can be evaluated by quantum elec-
trodynamics (QED), using perturbation theory.

8. Electromagnetism and Gravitation in the Framework
of Uniﬁed Model

It is assumed that the internal electromagnetic and gravitational interac-
tions of sub-elementary particles/antiparticles determine the corresponding
external potentials.

It leads from our theory that the electromagnetic (Eel) and gravitational
(EG) potentials of uncompensated sub-elementary particle, derived in Uniﬁed
model (UM), are both dependent on the actual kinetic energy of particle:

We put forward a conjecture, that the quantized energy of neutrino and

From (8.4a and 8.4b) one may see, that if our model is correct, the neu-
trino/antineutrino directly participate in gravitational interaction/repulsion.
The energy of such interaction should be dependent on density energy of neu-
trino and its generation. We have to keep in mind, that, in accordance to
UM, heavy µ and τ neutrino are related to gravitational radiation of nuclears
and e− neutrino, to that of the electrons.

The virtual electromagnetic photons are emitted and absorbed in a
course of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of sub-elementary particle in accordance with
known mechanism of the electric and magnetic dipole radiation.

The intensity of electric dipole radiation, using the analogy with classical

theory, may be expressed like:

We can see, that the external electromagnetic radiation of the charged

is in total accordance with conventional theory and experiment.

For the case of real photons, propagating in space with light velocity, the
electric and magnetic dipole radiation intensity of uncompensated pair of
sub-elementary particles (see 5.2 and 5.2a) are equal. The intensity of EM
radiation in Bivacuum is deﬁned by the Pointing vector: εem = c

8.1 Possible Mechanism of Electromagnetic Interaction

The diﬀerence between electromagnetic and gravitational interaction may

be demonstrated on example of the electron/positron triplet:

between two charged particles is a result of tendency of system to minimize

The repulsion is a consequence of the excessive uncompensated virtual
pressure: ∆V P ± = |V P + − V P −| between two particle with similar CVC±
charge (i.e. similar by energy uncompensated sub-elementary particle), as
respect to outside virtual pressure. Consequently:

The electromagnetic attraction is a consequence of the excessive uncom-
pensated virtual pressure: ∆V P ± = |V P + − V P −| outside two particle
with opposite CVC± charge (i.e. opposite by energy uncompensated sub-
elementary particle), as respect to inside virtual pressure. Consequently:

In accordance to theory, the Bjorkness force has a reverse square distance
dependence between pulsing bodies in liquid, as (1/r2), like gravitational

23

force. It is important, that this force could be positive and negative, depending
on diﬀerence of phase of pulsations. In turn, this phase shift is dependent on
relation of distance between bodies to acoustic (or gravitational in our case)
wave length. If the length of acoustic (gravitational) waves, excited by pulsing
bodies, is less than the distance between bodies, the Bjorkness (gravitational)
force is attractive. If the distance is much bigger than wave length, then the
attraction turns to repulsion. This eﬀect means antigravitation.

The large-scale honey-comb structure of the Universe, its huge voids,
could be explained by the interplay of gravitational attraction and repulsion
between clusters of galactics, depending on the distance between them.

Recently a strong experimental evidence appears, pointing to acceleration
of the Universe expansion. This phenomena could be explained by increasing
the antigravitation factor with increasing the distance between galactics. It
conﬁrms our hydrodynamic model of mechanism of gravitation.

9 Correlation Between Uniﬁed Model and General
Theory of Relativity

Einstein postulates (1965), that gravitation changes the trajectory of
probe body from the straight-line to geodesic one due to curving of con-
ventional two-dimensional surface. The Lobachevskian geometry on curved
surface was used in Einstein’s classic theory of gravitation. The criteria of
surface curvature of sphere is a curvature radius (R), deﬁned as:

R =

S
Σ − π

r

(9.1)

where S is a square of triangle on the ﬂat surface; R is a sphere radius;

Σ is a sum of angles in triangle.

The sum of angles in triangle (Σ) on the ﬂat surface is equal to π = 1800
and curvature R = ∞. For the other hand, on curved surface of radius
(0 < R < ∞), the sum of angles is

Σ = π + S/R2 > π

(9.2)

When (Σ − π) > 0, the curvature (R > 0) is positive; when (Σ − π) <

0, the curvature R is imaginary and corresponding space is negative.

In our Gravitation theory instead space-time curvature R, we introduce

the mass - dependent Bivacuum Symmetry Curvature, deﬁned as:

±LV = ±

tiparticles, related directly to mass symmetry shift (∆mC).

From (9.3) the vacuum curvature, induced by particle with mass, equal
to that of the electron at Golden mean (GM) condition (∆mC = m0 =
me = 9.1095 · 10−31kg) is: Le
V = 3.2288 · 1035m. For proton at GM condition
V = 5.212 · 1025m.
(∆mC = mP = 1.6726 · 10−27kg) we have: LP

The analogy between R and Lvac (9.1 and 9.3) is obvious. The more is
energy of gravitational ﬁeld ǫG, and actual inertial mass, generating this ﬁeld
(m+
C), the more is vacuum symmetry shift (∆mV ) and Bivacuum curvature.
The bigger is Bivacuum curvature (R or LV ), i.e. the more ﬂat is the Universe
the less is Bivacuum symmetry shift |±∆mV | and corresponding actual mass.
In accordance to our Uniﬁed model, the primary criteria of inertial mass
is a Bivacuum symmetry shift and it corresponding curvature. The physical
background of space-time curvature, postulated by general theory of relativ-
ity, is asymmetry of Bivacuum.

In our Uniﬁed model the matter and antimatter induce the opposite Bi-
vacuum symmetry shift. It means that antigravitation should exist between
matter and antimatter.

It follows from Bivacuum model, that the spin equilibrium shift between
Bivacuum fermions [BVF↑ ⇋ BVF↓] with properties of virtual electric and
magnetic dipoles, is dependent on external electric and magnetic ﬁelds. For
the other hand, the shift of this equilibrium inﬂuence Bivacuum symme-

This conclusion of our Uniﬁed model (UM) is conﬁrmed by known Biefeld-
Brown (charged condensers), Searl’s eﬀects, N-machine of de Palma and
Baurov’s device, related to dynamic Stavros experiments.

The photons trajectory reﬂects the Bivacuum curvature in 3D space. It
is a consequence of our model of photon, as a superposition of three pairs
of coherent pair [V + ⊲⊳ V −], moving in Bivacuum without its symmetry
perturbation.

25

As well, as General theory of relativity UM can explain the red shift of

photons in gravitational ﬁeld. The RED, low-frequency shift:

∆ω1,2

(9.6)

from the right line and is a consequence of increasing the vacuum symmetry

vacuum symmetry shift instead of curved space-time. The tensor properties

Gravitation, based on Uniﬁed model

As a consequence of our Uniﬁed model (see eqs. 7.5; 8.1 and 8.2), we
got for any closed system a simple, symmetric and very important
formula of UNIFICATION of pace of time [d ln t = dt/t] (temporal ﬁeld),

26

determined by relative change of kinetic energy of system (d ln Tk = dTk/Tk),
with changes of its electromagnetic and gravitational potential (dEel/dt =
dEG/dt), mass and spatial parameter - de Broglie wave length (L = ~/m+
Cv).

For private case of isolated charged particle we have:

d ln t = −d ln Tk = d ln m+

C + 2d ln L = −d ln Eel = −d ln EG

(9.11)

where the kinetic energy: Tk = ~2/(2m+
This Uniﬁcation Formula means that the coherent alternating kinetic en-
ergy of any closed system: internal, related to [C ⇋ W ] pulsation and exter-
nal, such as thermal oscillations of atoms/molecules, acceleration of macro-
scopic bodies - determines its pace of time, change of mass, spatial parame-

It follows from our approach, that time, like electromagnetic and gravita-

10 The mechanism of quantum entanglement between
coherent particles

In accordance to our UM, the nonlocal interaction (quantum entangle-
ment) between particles with coherent [C ⇋ W ] pulsation is realized via
Bivacuum symmetry oscillation (BvSO) and virtual pressure waves (VPW±),
activated by [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of pairs [sub-elementary particle (F+

Such a mechanism is mediated by nonlocal Bivacuum symmetry oscilla-
tions (BvSO) in the volume of virtual Bose condensate (VirBC), formed by
BVF l and BVB ± (see section 1).

The BvSO are the consequence of diﬀerent bivacuum symmetry shifts,
induced by [C] and [W] phase of uncompensated sub-elementary particles
and its spatial anisotropy. Their values from eq.(2.4a) are correspondingly:

It is easy to see from (10.5 and 10.6), that the bigger is Bivacuum symme-
try shift, induced by sender (S) and the more coherent are C ⇋ W pulsation
of (S) and receiver (R), the less is frequency deviation ∆ω = ωR − ωS and
the more eﬀective is nonlocal interaction (quantum entanglement) between
particles.

Spatial stability of complex systems: atoms, molecules and that of solids
means that in these systems superposition of CVC, representing [W] states
of elementary particles, forms hologram - like 3D standing waves superpo-
sition with location of nodes in the most probable positions of corpuscular
phase of the nucleons, electrons, atoms and molecules in condensed matter.
The binding of CVC by BVFl restore the [C] phase of particles in positions,
close to the most probable ones. So, the coherent atoms/molecules ther-
mal oscillation in composition of clusters, representing mesoscopic Bose con-
densate (Kaivarainen, 2001b,c), should be strictly correlated with coherent
[C ⇋ W ] pulsations of their elementary particles. The opposite statement
also is correct. The [C ⇋ W ] decoherence of elementary particles of atoms
and molecules in condensed matter may have a feedback reaction with their
random thermal ﬂuctuations.

The mechanism, proposed, may explain the theoretical (Einstein, et all.
1935; Cramer, 2001) and experimental evidence in proof of nonlocal interac-
tion between coherent elementary particles (Aspect, et all. 1982; 1983) and
atoms.

Our theory predicts, that the same mechanism may provide the distant
quantum entalgement between mesoscopic and macroscopic systems, includ-
ing biological ones, if [ C ⇋ W ] pulsations of their particles are ’tuned’ to
each other(Kaivarainen, 2001d).

Besides the problems, discussed in this paper, the Uniﬁed Model provides
a deeper understanding of Pauli and Heizenberg principles. It was shown,
using the Virial theorem, that condition of Bose condensation (BC) - real
in matter or virtual in Bivacuum - coincide with condition of nonlocality, as
independence of potential on distance. Generalized principle of Le Chatelier,
as a resistance of bivacuum symmetry shift and [C ⇋ W ] pulsation frequency
of particles to their acceleration (Kaivarainen, 2000, 2001), has been applied
for explanation of inertia. The electromagnetic contribution to this shift
resistance could be described by mechanism, proposed by Rueda and Haish
(1998, 2001).

11 Conclusion

29

Uniﬁed Model (UM) represents the next stage of our eﬀorts for uniﬁca-
tion of vacuum, matter and ﬁelds from few ground postulates. New concept
of Bivacuum is introduced, as a dynamic matrix of the Universe with su-
perﬂuid and nonlocal properties, composed from non mixing microscopic
sub-quantum particles of the opposite energies. The mesoscopic structure of
Bivacuum is presented by inﬁnitive number of three-dimensional (3D) dou-
ble cells, each cell containing a pair of correlated rotors and antirotors: (V +)
and (V −) of the opposite quantized energy, virtual mass, spin, charge and
magnetic moments.

The matter in form of sub-elementary particles/antiparticles is a result
of Bivacuum cells symmetry shift towards the positive or negative energy,
correspondingly. Certain combinations of their triplets form elementary par-
ticles/antiparticles. The [corpuscle (C) - wave (W)] duality is a result of
quantum beats between the ’actual’ and ’complementary’ (hidden) states of
sub-elementary particles/antiparticles. The [C] phase represents mass, elec-
tric and magnetic dipoles. The [W] phase exists in form of Cumulative virtual
cloud (CVC) of sub-quantum particles. The energy and impulse of [C] and
[W] phase are equal. The part of CVC, determined by ﬁne structure con-
stant, stands for virtual photons, responsible for interaction between charged
particles (i.e. electrons, positrons). They are result of dipole radiation, gen-
erated by [C ⇋ W ] oscillation of uncompensated sub-elementary particles
and antiparticles if triplets. ”Harmonization inﬂuence” of Bivacuum on mat-
ter properties is a result of induced resonance between virtual pressure waves
(VPW±) of positive and negative vacuum and [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of sym-
metric (hidden) pairs of sub-elementary particles and antiparticles, forming
electrons, positrons, quarks, etc. The fundamental Harmonization frequen-
cies of VPW± are deﬁned by the rest mass of the electrons of three lepton
c2/~, as postulated in UM. For the other hand, it
generation: ωe,µ,τ
is shown in our work, that the energy of sub-elementary particles, deﬁned
by the rest mass of the electrons (EC = EW = m0c2 = ~ω0)e,µ,τ , corre-
spond to Golden mean conditions, when their external group velocity is:
2 = φ = 0.618. It is demonstrated also, that realization of principle of
vφ/c
Least action can be a result of Bivacuum Harmonization action on particles
(cid:0)
dynamics. It is shown, that the pace of time for any closed system is de-
termined by pace of kinetic energy change of this system, i.e. by change of
its mass and spatial characteristics. The time oscillation (temporal ﬁeld) is
related in simple and symmetrical way to oscillation of electromagnetic and
gravitational ﬁelds.

nonlocal Bivacuum symmetry oscillations, accompanied the pulsation. The
correctness of our UM is conﬁrmed by very good coincidence between calcu-
lated and experimental values of magnetic moments of the electron. In accor-
dance to UM, a small deviation from the Bohr’s magneton is due to zero-point
oscillation and corresponding group velocity (v0) of the electron. The new
physical constant ”zero-point factor”: z = (αφ)1/2 = (v0/c) = 0.06715608,
where α = e2/~c = 0.0072973 is the electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant
and (φ = 0.618) is Golden mean, has been introduced.

Abstract

A recent general model of entanglement, [5], that goes much beyond
the usual one based on tensor products of vector spaces is further de-
It is shown that the usual Cartesian product can be
veloped here.
seen as two extreme particular instances of non-entanglement. Also
the recent approach to entanglement in [8] is incorporated in the gen-
eral model in [5]. The idea pursued is that entanglement is by now
far too important a phenomenon in Quantum Mechanics, in order to
be left conﬁned to its present exclusive modelling by tensor products.
Once this is realized, it turns out that one can quite easily de-entangle
entanglement from tensor products, and in fact, one can do so in a
large variety of ways. Within such general settings the issue of entan-
glement becomes connected with the issue of ”System versus Subsys-
tem” in General Systems Theory, where synthesizing subsystems into
a system may often be less diﬃcult than identifying subsystems in a
system.

0. Preliminaries

It is by now well and widely understood that entanglement is an es-
sential physical phenomenon, and in fact, also a major resource, in
Quantum Mechanics. As such, entanglement appeared for the ﬁrst

1

time in the celebrated 1935 EPR paper of Einstein, Podolsky and
Rosen, [1]. The term entanglement itself, however, was not used in
that paper. Instead, it was introduced, in German, as Verschr¨ankung,
in the subsequent papers of Schr¨odinger, [3,4], in which he commented
on the state of Quantum Mechanics at the time, and among others,
brought to attention the problematic situation which ever since would
be called Schr¨odinger’s cat.
In this regard, it may be instructive to note how often in science fun-
damental ideas, concepts or phenomena may take quite some time to
reach their better appreciation and understanding. Indeed, until re-
cently, hardly any of the major texts on Quantum Mechanics found it
necessary to deal with entanglement as a subject on its own, let alone,
an important one.

As it happened, independently, and prior to the EPR paper, in Multi-
linear Algebra, the concept of tensor product was introduced by math-
ematicians in view of its universal property of establishing a natural
connection between multilinear and linear mappings, see Appendix in
[5]. And it took some time, both for physicists and mathematicians,
to become aware of the fact that a natural mathematical formulation
of quantum entanglement can be obtained with tensor products of
Hilbert spaces.
It may be of a certain historical interest to ﬁnd out the ﬁrst publi-
cation in Quantum Mechanics where entanglement was treated using
tensor products.

The aim of [5] was as follows. So far, entanglement has been modelled
mathematically only by tensor products of vector, and in particular,
Hilbert spaces. However, in view of the signiﬁcant importance of en-
tanglement, one could ask the question :

• Can entanglement be modelled in other more general ways, than

by tensor products of vector spaces ?

In [5] an aﬃrmative answer was given to that question, by present-
ing general, and yet simple ways of entanglement, which contain as a
particular case tensor products. In fact, in that general approach to
entanglement, and unlike in the particular case of tensor products of
vector spaces, the spaces involved can be rather arbitrary sets, just as

2

in the case of Cartesian products, thus in particular, they need not be
vector spaces, and not even groups or semigroups. This paper further
develops the respective results.

Here however, it is important to note the following. The issue of
entanglement - when de-entangled from its present tensor product
based exclusive representation - becomes clearly connected with the
well known and rather deep issue of the relationship ”system versus
subsystem” in General Systems Theory. And this system-subsystem
relationship has two dual aspects. One is to synthesize given subsys-
tems into a system, while the other is to identify subsystems in a given
system. And as is well known, typically neither of the two are easy
issues, with the latter being often considerably more diﬃcult, than the
former, [9-11].

An easy to grasp illustration of that asymmetry in diﬃculty can be
given by the so called ”Universal Law of Unintended Eﬀects” in hu-
man aﬀairs, a law which operates, among others, precisely due to the
usual lack of appropriate insight into the structure of subsystems in a
given system.
By the way, in medicine, the so called side-eﬀects of treatments are
such typical unintended eﬀects.

As it happens, entanglement has so far only been considered in the
context of synthesis, that is, when independent quantum systems
S1, . . . , Sn, where n ≥ 2, with the corresponding Hilbert spaces H1, . . . , Hn,
are constituted into an aggregate quantum system S, with the result-
ing Hilbert space H = H1

Hn.

. . .

Such a synthesis approach, in a signiﬁcantly generalized manner, was
also pursued in [5].

In [8], the dual systems approach, that is, of identifying subsystems in
a system, is pursued to a good extent, even if the authors may insists,
as their very title indicates, to have gone beyond any systemic con-
siderations, by introducing observers in the process of instituting and
identifying entanglement. Indeed, the introduction of observers ”O”
does not do more than simply extend the initial quantum system ”S”

3

assumed to be without observers, to a new system ”S and O” which
this time contains both the quantum system and the observers. Of
course, one may miss that point, or simply refuse to have mixed to-
gether into a whole the quantum system and the observers. However,
the fact remains that, as for instance in [8], the observers enter into a
highly relevant interaction with the quantum system, not least in the
ways entanglement is instituted and then identiﬁed by them.
Therefore, the merit - and novelty - in [8] is precisely in the fact that
their approach to the issue of entanglement is no longer conﬁned to
the usual systems synthesis leading to a given tensor product, thus to
one and only way to have entanglement.
Instead, in [8], even if still tensor products are used exclusively in
modelling entanglement, the way entanglement is instituted and iden-
tiﬁed is due to the observers who have a certain latitude in identifying
subsystems in the given quantum system.

In the sequel when going signiﬁcantly beyond the usual tensor prod-
ucts, we shall mainly pursue the approach in [5] which is along the
usual systems synthesis. What is somewhat unexpected with such an
approach is that it can help in a similarly general way beyond tensor
products, this time along the dual approach of subsystems identiﬁca-
tion as well which, quite likely, is to be considerably more diﬃcult in
its fuller study.
In this regard, the subsystems identiﬁcation approach related to en-
tanglement suggested in [8], namely, by the introduction of observers,
can be seen as a particular case of the approach in this paper.
The advantage of such a particularization is in the fact mentioned
above, namely that, the subsystems identiﬁcation approach is typi-
cally far more diﬃcult than that of systems synthesis.

As for a general enough approach to entanglement along subsystems
identiﬁcation lines, this may quite likely be a considerably diﬃcult
task.

Two further observations are important, before proceeding with the
paper.

The usual, tensor product based concept of entanglement is in fact

4

given by the negation of a certain kind of rather simple representa-
tion. Consequently, any extension and/or deepening of that concept
is bound to open up a large variety of meaningful possibilities. This
is precisely one of the features - often overlooked - of the concept of
entanglement which makes it nontrivial. Indeed, the role in Physics of
deﬁnitions by negation is an issue which can touch upon fundamental
aspects, [6].

Quantum physics arguments expressing quite some concern related to
the usual tensor product based concept of entanglement were recently
presented in [7]. And they indicate what may be seen as a lack of
ontological robustness of that concept. As an eﬀect, one may expect
that what appears to be entanglement in terms of tensor products may
in fact correspond to considerably deeper and more general aspects.
In this regard, the old saying that ”the whole is more than the sum
of its parts” may in fact mean that what is involved in that ”more”
in the case of entanglement can correspond to very diﬀerent things,
depending on the speciﬁc situations.

A likely consequence of these two facts is that, when seen in its depth
and generality, the concept of entanglement may naturally and neces-
sarily branch into a larger variety of rather diﬀerent concepts which
are only somewhat loosely related to one another.

The main deﬁnition, [5], is presented in section 3, and it is further
extended in section 5. The main new results can be found in sections
4 and 5.

1. Generators and Bases

For convenience, here and in the next two sections we recall a few con-
cepts and results in [5]. These are within the usual, that is, systems
synthesis approach to entanglement.

Deﬁnition 1.1.

Given any set X, a mapping ψ : P(X) −→ P(X) will be called a

5

generator, if and only if

(1.1)

∀ A ⊆ X : A ⊆ ψ(A)

and

(1.2)

∀ A ⊆ A ′ ⊆ X : ψ(A) ⊆ ψ(A ′)

Let us denote by

(1.3)

Gen(X)

the set of generators on X.

Examples 1.1.

1) A trivial, yet as we shall see important, example of generator is
given by ψ = idP(X), that is, ψ(A) = A, for A ⊆ X.

2) Another example which is important in the sequel is obtained as
follows. Given any binary operation α : X × X −→ X, we call a
subset A ⊆ X to be α-stable, if and only if

(1.4)

x, y ∈ A =⇒ α(x, y) ∈ A

Obviously, X itself is α-stable, and the intersection of any family of α-
stable subsets is also α-stable. Consequently, for every subset A ⊆ X,
we can deﬁne the smallest α-stable subset which contains it, namely

(1.5)

[A]α =

TA⊆B, B α−stable B

Therefore, we can associate with α the mapping ψα : P(X) −→ P(X)
deﬁned by

(1.6)

ψα(A) = [A]α, A ⊆ X

which is obviously a generator. Furthermore, we have in view of (1.5)

6

(1.7)

∀ A ⊆ X : ψα(ψα(A)) = ψα(A)

since as mentioned, [A]α is α-stable, and obviously [A]α ⊆ [A]α.

We note that, in general, the relation ψ(ψ(A)) = ψ(A), with A ⊆ X,
need not hold for an arbitrary generator ψ.

3) A particular case of 2) above is the following. Let (S, ∗) be a
semigroup with the neutral element e. Then [{e}]∗ = {e}, while for
a ∈ S, a 6= e, we have [{a}]∗ = {a, a ∗ a, a ∗ a ∗ a, . . .}.

For instance, if (S, ∗) = (N, +), then [{1}]+ = N \ {0} = N+.

4) A further case, which is of relevance in tensor products, is when we
are given a vector space E over some ﬁeld of scalars K. If now we have
any subset A ⊆ E, then we can deﬁne ψ(A) as the vector subspace
in E generated by A. Clearly, we obtain a generator in the sense of
Deﬁnition 1.1.

Here one should, however, note that this generator is no longer of the
simple form in 2) above. Indeed, the generation of a vector subspace
does involve two algebraic operations, and not only one, as in 2) above,
namely, addition of vectors, and multiplication of vectors with scalars.

5) The general pattern corresponding to 4), and which contains 2)
as a particular case is as follows. Given on a set X the mappings
α1, . . . , αn : X −→ X and β1 : K1×X −→ X, . . . , βm : Km×X −→ X,
where K1, . . . , Km are certain sets. Then we call a subset A ⊆ X to
be α, β-stable, if and only if, see (3.1)

(1.8)

x, y ∈ A =⇒ αi(x, y) ∈ A,

1 ≤ i ≤ n

and

(1.9)

x ∈ A =⇒ βj(cj, x) ∈ A,

cj ∈ Kj, 1 ≤ j ≤ m

Obviously, X itself is α, β-stable, and the intersection of any family of
α, β-stable subsets is again α, β-stable. Thus, for every subset A ⊆ X,

7

we can deﬁne the smallest α, β-stable subset which contains it, namely

(1.9)

[A]α,β =

TA⊆B, B α,β−stable B

Therefore, we can deﬁne the mapping ψα,β : P(X) −→ P(X) as given
by

(1.11)

ψα,β(A) = [A]α,β, A ⊆ X

which is obviously a generator in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.1. Further-
more, we have in view of (1.10)

(1.12)

∀ A ⊆ X : ψα,β(ψα,β(A)) = ψα,β(A)

since as mentioned, [A]α,β is α, β-stable, and obviously [A]αβ ⊆ [A]α,β.

Deﬁnition 1.2.

Given a generator ψ : P(X) −→ P(X), a subset B ⊆ X is called a
ψ-basis for X, if and only if

(1.13)

ψ(B) = X

and B is minimal with that property, namely

(1.14)

∀ B ′ $ B : ψ(B ′) $ X

Let us denote by

(1.15) Bsψ(X)

Note 1.1.

the set of all B ⊆ X which are a ψ-basis for X.

1) In view of 3) in Examples 1.1., it follows that neither {0}, nor {1}
are ψ+-bases in (N, +), while on the other hand, {0, 1} is.

8

2) Within the setting in 3) in Examples 1.1., a subset B ⊂ E is a
ψ-basis in the vector space E, if and only if it is a basis in the usual
vector space sense.

2. Covering Generators

The usual systems synthesis approach to entanglement is extended
now considerably beyond tensor products, based on the previous sec-
tion 1.

Deﬁnition 2.1.

Examples 2.1.

Given the sets X and Y , with the corresponding generators ψ : P(X) −→
P(X), ϕ : P(Y ) −→ P(Y ), and χ : P(X × Y ) −→ P(X × Y ). We
call χ to be a covering for ψ, ϕ, if and only if

(2.1)

∀ A ⊆ X, B ⊆ Y : ψ(A) × ϕ(B) ⊆ χ(A × B)

1) Obviously, if ψ = idP(X), ϕ = idP(Y ) and χ = idP(X×Y ), then χ is
a covering for ψ, ϕ.

2) Let now α : X × X −→ X and β : Y × Y −→ Y be two binary
operations and, as usual, let us associate with them the binary oper-
ation α × β : (X × Y ) × (X × Y ) −→ (X × Y ) given by

(2.2)

(α × β)((x, y), (u, v)) = (α(x, u), β(y, v)), x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y

Then ψα×β is a covering for ψα, ψβ, see [5], Lemma 2.1.

3) The case of interest for tensor products is the following. Given two
vector spaces E and F on a scalar ﬁeld K, let ψ and ϕ be the corre-
sponding generators as deﬁned in 4) in Examples 1.1. Further, on the
vector space E ×F , let χ be the generator deﬁned in the same manner.

Then it follows easily that χ is a covering for ψ and ϕ.

3. A General Concept of Entanglement

Within the usual systems synthesis approach, and based on the above,
we can now give a very general deﬁnition of entanglement, much be-
yond that in terms of tensor products, or in fact, of any algebraic
nature as such.

Deﬁnition 3.1.

Given the sets X and Y , with the corresponding generators ψ : P(X) −→
P(X), ϕ : P(Y ) −→ P(Y ), and χ : P(X × Y ) −→ P(X × Y ), where
χ is a covering for ψ and ϕ.

Given now two subsets A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y . A subset C ⊆ [A × B]χ is
called entangled, if and only if it is not of the form

(3.1) C = [A ′]ψ × [B ′]ϕ

for some A ′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B.

Note 3.1.

1) Let us indicate the way the above Deﬁnition 3.1. contains as a
particular case the usual concept of entanglement as formulated in
terms of tensor products. We therefore assume the setting in 3) in
Examples 2.1. above, and take X = E, Y = F . Further, we take
A = X, B = Y , in which case obviously [A × B]χ = X × Y .

Now we take the one element subset

(3.2) C = { x

y + x ′

y ′ } ⊆ [A × B]χ

N

N

where x, x ′ ∈ X are linearly independent, and the same holds for
y, y ′ ∈ Y .

Then it is easy to see that C is entangled in the sense of Deﬁnition

10

y + x ′
3.1., if and only if the element x
in the sense of the usual tensor products.

N

N

y ′ ∈ E

F is entangled

N

2) The interest in the general concept of entanglement in Deﬁnition
3.1. is, among others, in the fact that it is no longer conﬁned within
any kind of algebraic context. In this way, this paper, following [5],
shows that entanglement can, so to say, be de-entangled not only from
tensor products, but also more generally, from all algebra as well.

3) A further interest in the general concept of entanglement in Deﬁni-
tion 3.1. is as follows. The structure on the ”parts” X and Y is deﬁned
by ψ and ϕ, respectively. On the other hand - and much unlike in the
case of tensor products - the structure on the ”whole” constituted by
the ”parts”, namely, on X × Y is not deﬁned by ψ and ϕ, but instead
by χ which is only requested a rather weak compatibility condition
with ψ and ϕ. In this way - and once again much unlike with tensor
products - there is a signiﬁcant freedom for the structure on X × Y ,
when related to the structures on X and Y , and yet, the concept of
entanglement can be deﬁned.

4) It is instructive to note that the above Deﬁnition 3.1. of entangle-
ment contains as a particular case the usual Cartesian products as well.

Indeed, in view of 1) in Examples 1.1., we can consider on X, Y and
X × Y the respective trivial generators denoted for convenience by
ψ, ϕ and χ. Then according to 1) in Examples 2.1., χ is a covering
for ψ and ϕ.

Let now A = X, B = Y . Then clearly [A × B]χ = X × Y . Therefore,
a subset C ⊆ [A × B]χ = X × Y is not entangled in the sense of
Deﬁnition 3.1., if and only if it is of the form

(3.3) C = A ′ × B ′

for some A ′ ⊆ X and B ′ ⊆ Y , since obviously [A ′]ψ = A ′ and
[B ′]ϕ = B ′.

It follows that, in the above particular case, being a usual Cartesian

11

product is the same with not being entangled in the sense of Deﬁnition
3.1.

5) The generality of the concept of entanglement given in Deﬁnition
3.1., which at ﬁrst appears conﬁned to the systems synthesis approach,
has nevertheless the further advantage to allow a certain incursion into
the dual subsystems identiﬁcation approach, as seen in section 5.

4. A Partial Order on Generators

The way usual Cartesian products are contained as particular cases of
non-entangled sets in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.1., see 4) in Note 3.1.,
suggests the introduction of the following partial order on generators.

Deﬁnition 4.1.

Given a set X, and on it two generators, see (1.3), ψ, ϕ ∈ Gen(X), we
denote

(4.1)

ψ ≤ ϕ ⇐⇒ ψ(A) ⊆ ϕ(A), A ⊆ X

(cid:3)

Obviously, with this partial order ≤, the set Gen(X) of generators on
X has as its minimum the generator ψX = idP(X), see 1) in Examples
1.1., while its maximum is the generator ψX given by ψX(A) = X, for
A ⊆ X.

It follows, therefore, in view of 1) in Examples 2.1., that for two arbi-
trary sets X and Y , we have

(4.2)

ψX×Y is a cover for ψX and ψY

and similarly one obtains easily that

(4.3)

ψX×Y is a cover for ψX and ψY

As seen in 4) in Note 3.1., the above property (4.2) leads to the fact

12

that the usual Cartesian product of two sets X and Y can be identi-
ﬁed with certain particular cases of non-entangled sets in the sense of
Deﬁnition 3.1.

Here we show that the same identiﬁcation between Cartesian prod-
ucts and certain particular instances of non-entanglement can be ob-
Indeed, let us take
tained from the above property (4.3) as well.
A = X, B = Y . Then obviously [A × B]ψX = X × Y . Given now any
subset C ⊆ [A × B]ψX = X × Y , then in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.1.
C is not entangled, if and only if it is of the form

C = [A ′]ψX × [B ′]ψY

for suitable A ′ ⊆ A, B ′ ⊆ B. However, by deﬁnition [A ′]ψX =
X, [B ′]ψY = Y , thus

In this way we obtain a double connection between usual Cartesian
products, and on the other hand, particular cases of non-entanglement
in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.1., as presented in

Given two sets X and Y . Their Cartesian product X × Y can be
obtained as a particular case of a non-entangled set in the sense of the
Deﬁnition 3.1., by taking on each of the sets X, Y and X × Y either
the minimum generators, or the maximum ones.

It follows that the two extreme cases of non-entanglement in the sense
of Deﬁnition 3.1., which correspond to (4.2) and (4.3), give in fact the
usual Cartesian product.

Thus the nontrivial cases of non-entanglement, or equivalently, of en-
tanglement correspond to generators which are neither too small, nor
too large in the sense of their partial order in (4.1).

13

C = X × Y

Theorem 4.1.

Note 4.1.

And as follows obviously from (4.1), there can be a considerable gap
between the minimum generator ψX and the maximum generator ψX
on an arbitrary set X. Therefore, there is a considerable scope for
nontrivial cases of entanglement, as given in the sense of Deﬁnition
3.1.

5. Exploring Subsystems

Given a system SZ with state-space Z, supposed to be large, such
as for instance a quantum system QH with a large Hilbert space H
describing its states. We shall attempt to explore SZ by identifying in
it in various ways subsystems SX, with corresponding state-spaces X.

Here we can note that the many possible ways such subsystems SX can
be identiﬁed may easily include the case when this identiﬁcation pro-
cess involves an observer O situated outside, and independent of SZ.
After all, such an identiﬁcation is not supposed to be implemented by
SZ itself, which anyhow is typically assumed to be but a usual physical
system, thus incapable of any self-referential performance.
In this way, the approach in [8], which introduces observers in the pro-
cess of instituting and identifying entanglement, can be incorporated
in the above general scheme.

Now, the simplest case which may already involve the possibility of
entanglement is when two subsystems SX and SY , with the corre-
sponding state-spaces X and Y , can be identiﬁed in SZ.

Here a ﬁrst important point to note is that, as often happens in prac-
tical situations, two such subsystems SX and SY need not be disjoint
in the strong sense. In other words, for their respective state-spaces
X and Y , we can in general have the situation

(5.1) X ∩ Y 6= φ

Consequently, we may have to avoid the assumption that the relation
X × Y ⊆ Z would hold between the state spaces involved, since the

14

states through which SX and SY may go through can fail to be always
independent of one another. Instead, we can assume a more general
relationship between the state-spaces X, Y and Z, such as for instance
given by a mapping

(5.2)

f : ∆ ⊆ X × Y −→ Z

Consequently, it is natural to give the following extended version of
the concept of entanglement in Deﬁnition 3.1., this time no longer
along the systems synthesis line, but instead, in the subsystems iden-
tiﬁcation spirit.

Namely, ﬁrst we extend Deﬁnition 2.1., as follows

Deﬁnition 5.1.

Given a set Z and a mapping f : ∆ ⊆ X × Y −→ Z. Further, given
the generators χ ∈ Gen(Z), ψ ∈ Gen(X) and ϕ ∈ Gen(Y ). We call χ
a covering for ψ and ϕ, if and only if

(5.3) ∀ A ⊆ X, B ⊆ Y : f ((ψ(A)×ϕ(B))∩∆) ⊆ χ(f ((A×B)∩∆))

Examples 5.1.

1) In case Z = X × Y = ∆ and f = idX×Y , that is, f (x, y) = (x, y),
with x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , then condition (5.3) obviously becomes (2.1).
Thus Deﬁnition 5.1. is indeed and extension of Deﬁnition 2.1.

2) A relevant case of the situation in Deﬁnition 5.1. which goes be-
yond that in Deﬁnition 2.1. is as follows. Suppose φ 6= U = X ∩Y , and

(5.4) ∆ = { (u, u) | u ∈ U } ∪ ((X \ U) × Y ) ∪ (X × (Y \ U))

which corresponds to the situation when the subsystems SX and SY
share the common set of states U, and arbitrary states (v, w) ∈ U × U
can only occur if v = w ∈ U.

A situation more general than in (5.4) can happen when states v ∈

15

V ⊆ X of the subsystem SX can only be related to certain states
w ∈ W ⊆ Y of the subsystem SY . In such a case, instead of (5.4), we
may have

(5.5) ∆ = ∆V, W ∪ ((X \ V ) × Y ) ∪ (X × (Y \ W ))

where

(5.6) ∆V, W ⊆ V × W

Obviously, (5.4) corresponds to the particular case when V = W =
U = X ∩ Y and ∆V, W = { (u, u) | u ∈ U }.

(cid:3)

And now, to the extension of the concept of entanglement in Deﬁni-
tion 3.1., presented in

Deﬁnition 5.2.

Given a set Z and a mapping f : ∆ ⊆ X × Y −→ Z. Further, given
the generators χ ∈ Gen(Z), ψ ∈ Gen(X) and ϕ ∈ Gen(Y ), where χ is
a covering for ψ and ϕ.

Let A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y . Then a subset C ⊆ [f ((A × B) ∩ ∆)]χ is
called entangled, if and only if it is not of the form

(5.7) C = f (([A ′]ψ × [B ′]ϕ) ∩ ∆)

for some A ′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B.

Examples 5.2.

1) In the setting of 1) in Examples 5.1., condition (5.7) is clearly the
same with (3.1). Therefore Deﬁnition 5.2. gives an extension of Deﬁ-
nition 3.1.

2) Obviously, the situations (5.4) - (5.6) at 2) in Examples 5.1. can
occur with the concept of entanglement in Deﬁnition 5.2. as well.

16

3) We illustrate now in the case of usual tensor products the above
condition (5.7) of the extended concept of entanglement given by Def-
inition 5.2.

Let the system SZ have as state-space the vector space over the ﬁeld
K, given by

(5.8) Z = U

E

F

L

L

We consider now the subsystems SX and SY with the respective state-
spaces

(5.9) X = U

E,

Y = U

F

L

L

and thus obtain the situation (5.4) at 2) in Examples 5.1., namely

(5.10) ∆ = { (u, u) | u ∈ U } ∪ (E × Y ) ∪ (X × F )

in which case we can take f : ∆ −→ Z given by

(5.11)

f (x, y) =

u if x = y = u ∈ U

x + y

otherwise

Now we consider on X, Y and Z the respective generators ψ, ϕ and
χ, as given at 3) in Examples 2.1.
In this case, we are within the
general construction of tensor products as recalled at 3) in Examples
in [5], see also Appendix in [5]. Therefore, we have the natural

which together with (5.2) give

where in view of (5.10), (5.12), we have

But (5.8), (5.9), (5.12) and (5.14) result in

since up to natural isomorphisms, we have

Z = U × E × F, X = U × E,

y = U × F

Consequently, (5.11) and (5.13) give

At last, we can return to the issue of entanglement. For that purpose,
let us take A = X and B = Y . Then

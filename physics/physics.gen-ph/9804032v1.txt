ABSTRACT

The Aharonov-Bohm scattering amplitude is calculated in the context of planar gravity with localized sources
which also carry a magnetic ﬂux. These sources cause space-time to develop conical singularities at their
location, thus introducing novel eﬀects in the scattering of electrically charged particles. The behaviour of
the wave function in the proximity of the classical scattering directions is analyzed by means of an asymptotic
expansion previously introduced by the author. It is found that, in contrast with the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect
in ﬂat space, integer values of the numerical ﬂux can produce observable eﬀects.

Introduction

The Aharonov-Bohm (-Ehrenberg-Siday) eﬀect [1, 2] is a well-known example of quantum scattering process
without classical analog, and its importance is reﬂected in the large number of analyses that have appeared
in the literature (see the monograph [3] for a thorough exposition and a long list of references). The idealized
experiment that produces the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) eﬀect in its simplest version requires little description:
charged particles of non-zero mass propagate at right angles to an inﬁnitely long straight solenoid that
encloses a magnetic ﬂux; the region containing the magnetic ﬁeld is inaccessible to the particles, in spite of
which the magnetic ﬂux inside the solenoid aﬀects their propagation and an interference pattern appears
that cannot be explained in classical physics. Among many references, [4, 5] are particularly relevant and
readable. Detailed descriptions of real experimental set-ups can be found in [3] but we shall not be concerned
with the practical aspects of the problem.

In this work we shall introduce a further complication in the problem: our ﬂux tubes will have a non-
vanishing mass density and will introduce gravitational eﬀects in the motion of the scattered particles. In
order to make the problem amenable we shall restrict ourselves to the simplest situation of an inﬁnitely
long and thin straight ﬂux tube with constant magnetic ﬂux and mass density. We shall sometimes call the
idealized ﬂux tube “string”. The advantage of the restriction just mentioned is that the gravitational ﬁeld
of the string can be described by general relativity in 2 + 1 dimensions [6, 7], as the third spatial dimension
can be taken to be parallel to the ﬂux and will decouple from the problem. In the absence of other sources
of gravity, the space created by the string will be locally ﬂat everywhere except at the location of the string,
and globally will be a 2-cone. The time dimension remains unaﬀected as the string is taken to be static and
at rest. The charged particle will be assumed to be massive but light enough to have negligible eﬀect on the
gravitational ﬁeld of the string.

Given the previous simpliﬁcations, the object of interest is the wave function and scattering amplitude of
a charged test particle moving in the conical background created by the ﬂux line, hence the title of this paper.
Naturally the solution will be a combination of planar gravitational scattering and AB scattering. The pure
gravitational scattering amplitude was calculated in [6, 7, 8, 9] (see also [10]), and the pure AB scattering
amplitude in [2, 11]-[18] following diﬀerent procedures. The deﬁnition of the scattering amplitude requires
, with
knowledge of the long-distance behaviour of the scattered wave function, and usually the limit r
r the distance from the scattering center, can be taken safely. One of the peculiarities of our problem is
that, as in the purely gravitational case, there are two distinguished scattering directions independent of the
energy of the incident particle that we call “classical” scattering directions, and the limits “approaching a
” do not commute. If we take the long-distance limit ﬁrst, the
classical scattering direction” and “r
wave function develops singularities at the classical scattering directions, and if we approach those directions
ﬁrst then the long-distance limit does not exist. Physically the problem is that at the classical scattering
directions the splitting of the wave function into “scattered” and “incident” (or transmitted) parts is no
longer meaningful; only the complete wave function is free from discontinuities or singularities [9, 18]. The
scattering amplitude, therefore, cannot be deﬁned at those directions. This phenomenon occurs in the AB
eﬀect at the forward direction and in scattering in planar gravity at two directions that depend on the mass
of the scattering center only [6, 7].

The analysis of the wave function near the classical scattering directions is best performed in the approach
of [9] for planar gravitational scattering and [18] for AB scattering, and here the same approach will be used
to solve the more general case of the AB eﬀect on a cone. This article is organized as follows. In Section 2
we shall review the non-relativistic propagator of a charged particle in presence of a massive magnetic ﬂux
line. A piece of the propagator is given as an integral that is calculated in Section 3, where the result is
used to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the propagator. We ﬁnd that gravitational eﬀects split the wave
function into two halves that propagate along the classical scattering directions, and the two halves carry
opposite AB-like phases. The last Section contains a discussion of the results; we conclude that, in contrast
with the pure AB eﬀect, the integer part of the numerical ﬂux can be measured by means of an (imaginary)
interference experiment.

2 The quantum-mechanical propagator

We are interested in the problem of a charged particle moving on a conical background created by a massive
ﬂux tube assumed to coincide with the z-axis. We recall that in this situation (quantum scattering of a
test-particle by a static mass) the time-component of the metric does not play any role. A convenient
characterization of this conical space is based on embedded coordinates [7]

with A(r) given by (2) and the metric gij corresponding to the line element (1). Based on previous results
[9, 18] we expect the wave function to exhibit two privileged scattering directions that depend only on the
mass density of the ﬂux line, and superimposed on each of these directions AB-like phases induced by the
magnetic ﬂux . As the separate cases of planar gravitational scattering and AB scattering are known, all we
have to do is combine the propagators analyzed in the above mentioned references. The result can be given
as a Bessel series [10]

or, after inserting the Schl¨aﬂi representation for the Bessel functions [13, 7, 8], as the sum of a “transmited”

the integer and fractional parts of the numerical ﬂux ν. The suﬃxes of the two parts of the propagator in
(3) indicate that one part corresponds to the transmitted and the other to the scattered waves, although
this splitting of the total propagator should not be taken literally because, as we shall see, both parts are
required to determine the wave function of the “scattered” particle at the classical scattering directions. The
propagator (3) reduces to the AB propagator if α = 1 and to the Deser-Jackiw propagator [7] of planar
gravitational scattering if ν = 0. As in [9, 18] the propagator (3) leads to an integral than can be calculated
by a saddle-point approximation for all scattered directions except the classical ones. The integral in question

We have used the notation
to indicate that the equation is an asymptotic expansion for large ρ [19]. From
this result we can immediately write down the scattering amplitude of a well-localized wave packet approach-

This scattering amplitude reduces to the AB or to the planar gravitational case in the appropriate limits.
Naturally the global phases included in (6) are irrelevant if we are interested in the scattering cross section
2 only. Let us now remember that the classical scattering directions in our problem correspond, if

The fact that the scattering amplitude (6) diverges at these two directions is of course not due to any patholo-
gies of the scattering process but rather to the fact that, around θ = θ±, the saddle point approximation is
not warranted. In the next section we shall follow the approach of [9, 18] to determine the wave function at
the two directions θ±.

3 Asymptotic expansions

We will now develop an asymptotic expansion of the integral I(ρ, φ, α, ν) deﬁned in (4) that, unlike a mere
saddle-point approximation, be applicable when the scattering angle θ is close or equal to the classical
scattering directions θ±. To that end we write the integral (4) as a sum of two terms

and we can consider one of the two integrals, say I1, and treat the other one by analogy. Following the lines

These calculations are rather lengthy, although straightforward, and can be reproduced after following the
explanations given in [9, 18]. Using these results we can consider the limit a(αφ)ρ
, which corresponds
to long distances from the scattering center away from the classical scattering directions θ±. Although the
actual calculations are a good illustration of the use of our expansion (7), the ﬁnal result coincides with (5)
and (6) and therefore is of little relevance. The true interest of (7) is its good behaviour about θ = θ±, where
the total integral develops a ﬁnite discontinuity. If for example φ =

Both discontinuities cancel out in the complete propagator and thus the complete wave function is ﬁnite at

Interpretation and conclusions

The most interesting consequences of the propagators just obtained are that, at leading order in the long-
distance limit, a wave packet approaching the magnetic tube will split into two halves that propagate along
the classical scattering directions as in the case of pure gravitational scattering [9], and that the two halves
carry opposite phases that depend on the combined parameter ν/α only. The situation is schematically
represented in Fig. 1, and agrees with the purely gravitational or AB cases in the appropriate limits.

The fact that the opposite phases of the two emerging wave packets depend on the whole numerical ﬂux
ν opens the possibility of measuring ν by means of an interference experiment. That imaginary experiment
would consist in reuniting both diverging wave packets and allowing them to interfere on a ﬂat screen
perpendicular to the incident beam; the resulting interference pattern will show bands whose shift from the
centered position depends on ν/α. As the parameter α can be measured from the scattering angle, ν can in
principle be determined. This contrasts with the purely AB case, where only the fractional part of the ﬂux
can be measured.

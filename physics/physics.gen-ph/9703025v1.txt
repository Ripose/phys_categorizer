The baryon overdensity and the matching of the big bang explosion en-

ergy with gravitation can be solved by a cyclical baryonic bounce model with

correction to the stress-energy tensor. Subtracting accretion energy from the

CMBR allows enough baryons in nucleosynthesis to close the universe. Col-

lapse to inﬁnite density states must be prevented by energy losses at supranu-

clear densities. As long as the Einstein tensor is coupled to the stress-energy

tensor, any quantum correction must involve an energy sink.

I. INTRODUCTION:

Limits on general relativity

General relativity was discovered early this century and twenty four years after its

introduction, it was found to predict black holes. [15] Relativity has been extrapolated

to where stars, galaxies and the whole universe could be compressed into a space smaller

than an atom. There is not one shred of evidence that the universe started at Planck

densities ρ = 1093g/cm3 and temperatures T = 1031oK. No high energy phenomena have

been found from the ﬁrst instant of creation. The nucleosynthesis of light atomic nuclei

4He, 2H, and 7Li took place around densities of 105g/cm3 and temperatures of ∼ 1010oK,

according to accepted models [18,25]. These conditions are the most extreme that has

been conﬁrmed in the big bang. Thus general relativity, as applied to the universe [21],

has been extrapolated eighty orders of magnitude in density from points at which it has

been validated. Only for a homogeneous, isotropic universe, the ﬁeld equation has been

simpliﬁed to the Friedmann equation

H 2 + (K/a2) ≡

+ (K/a2) = (8πρG)/3 ,

2

˙a
a (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where H ≡ ˙a/a is the Hubble constant, which is time dependent. G is the gravitational

constant, ρ is the mass-energy density, p is the pressure and a(t) is the scale factor of the

universe, ∼ 1028cm, presently. There is always a perfect ﬂuid in the stress-energy tensor

Tαβ = ρuαuβ + p(gαβ + uαuβ) ,

which ignores viscosity, shearing forces and subatomic eﬀects including diﬀerences be-

tween individual baryons and bulk baryons, nB ≫ 103. Since it has been validated up to

nuclear densities in pulsars, changes in the stress-energy tensor Tαβ at higher densities

will be investigated.

II. Theoretical changes necessary

The Oppenheimer and Volkoﬀ equations of state [16] are used for neutron density

matter and neutron stars up to 3x1014gm/cm3,

= 4πr2ρ

dm
dr

dp
dr

= −(ρ + p)(m + (4πr3p))/r(r − m),

(2.1)

where m is the mass within a given radius r. Since these equations result from the

ﬁeld equation, information about the density change with pressure is also necessary.

Neutron stars theoretically have masses up to 5M⊙. Single neutrons have a compression

energy about 300 MeV [6]. Nuclear colliders start producing quark-gluon plasma at

energies over 2x1012oK ≈ 184MeV . After all the space in the neutron is eliminated

ρ > 1017gm/cm3, the net quantum eﬀect of further collapse and core compression must

be a reversible energy sink. Since nuclear pressures can’t halt a gravitational collapse,

suﬃcient energy loss at supranuclear densities must result in a stable conﬁguration prior

to quark formation. An inhomogeneous collapse must stop when the compression energy

losses of core neutrons at peak ρ ∼ 1018 − 1019g/cm3 exactly match the gravitational

energy, as shown in ﬁgure 1.

III. Resulting changes in our understanding

Prior to the big bang, core densities slowly increased and the energy sink of compressive

losses rapidly overtook the collapse energy by an overall mass-density ρ ∼ 1016gm/cm3.

If all the matter in the universe was in a spherical mass to start, its radius was ∼ 1013cm.

3

As the density rose in the core, the ﬁeld disappeared and the pressure p = ρ/3 → 0

in the stress-energy tensor as well. By including this energy loss, energy-momentum

is conserved. With T and the vacuum energy λ ≈ 0, an open universe existed during

t ≤ 0. No singularities ever existed since there were no inﬁnities in energy, density or time.

Accretion and other photons from previous universes were very red shifted by release into

volumes ≫ today, so that they played no role during the open universe period. Neutron

compression energy supplied ≈ 160MeV ≈ 1.85x1012oK which propelled the farthest

galaxies ∼ 0.5c. After the bounce, the metric changed to ﬂat. There was no diﬀerence

whether the early universe was closed or open [13]. The extrinsic curvature (6 ˙a2)/a2

was much more important than the intrinsic curvature ±6/a2 within any hyperspace of

homogeneity, since ˙a2 was very large initially. The zones of inﬂuence were too small to

respond diﬀerently to negative or positive spacetime curvatures.

The standard hot universe problems [12], can be summarized and solved with the

above correction. The singularity problem follows from the scale factor of the universe

a(t) vanishes as t → 0 and the energy density becomes inﬁnitely large. The inhomogeneity

of matter with the energy sink and red shifting of radiation prior to the big bang caused

the total energy-density → 0.

The ﬂatness problem can be stated in several ways. The ratio of the universe’s mean

mass density to the cold Einstein-de Sitter universe

ρ/ρc = 3H 2/8πρG .

(3.1)

The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker(FRW) equation implies that this ratio, which was

proportional to curvature, was 1 ± 10−60 at the Planck era. The ’kinetic energy’ ( ˙a/a)2

was equal to the gravitational mass-energy 8πρG/3 , so that k ≈ 0 in equation (1.1).

Only a bounce mechanism by which the gravitational mass-energy was converted into

kinetic energy could allow the universe to be so ﬂat. The unchanged nuclear state of the

4

core allows this to happen without producing quarks. ∼ 160 MeV was suﬃcient to break

the shell into billions of cold baryonic masses ≤ 1016M⊙ . For mass M the gravitational

radius Rg = GM/c2 then

ρ = c6/G3M 2 ,

at black hole formation. Thus primordial holes could only be formed from the expanding

shell neutrons in masses ≥ 4M⊙ if ρmax ≈ 3x1016g/cm3.

If this density can not be

exceeded, then smaller black holes < 1M⊙ could not be formed, which would explain the

missing Hawking radiation [8].

The horizon problem has to do with areas in the initial instant of creation that are

too far from each other to have been inﬂuenced by initial disturbances. A light pulse

beginning at t=0 will have travelled by time t, a physical distance

and this gives the physical horizon distance or Hubble radius dH. In a matter dominated

l(t) = a(t)

dH ≈ 2H −1

−1/2
0 Ω

(1 + z)−3/2 ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

where Ω0 = ρ/ρc in the present universe. This distance is compared with the radius L(t)

of the region at time t which evolves into our currently observed area of the universe

≈ 1010years. Using a quark model near Planck conditions, this ratio l3/L3 is going to

be very small, about 10−83. Since the average baryonic density initially is ∼ 1016g/cm3

rather than Planck densities of 1093g/cm3, the horizon problem is diminished by a factor

of ∼ 1077. Either the continuing loss of shell mass during Tαβ ≈ 0 or a major distur-

bance near equilibrium, will allow a nearly simultaneous release of the stored neutron

compression energy. Since state data on bulk nucleons is lacking, a reduction equation

5

for a static system is extrapolated for compression losses of Esink = exp(ρ/2x1014) in the

energy term Tˆoˆo.

The homogeneity and isotropy problems arise due to the postulated start of the

universe in such a state. The distribution of galaxies and clusters are not random on large

scales. A compilation of 869 clusters has shown a quasi-regular pattern with high density

regions separated by voids at intervals ≈ 120Mpc. [4]. The CMBR has dipole anisotropy

not due to our Local Group motion [11]. The universe is not isotropic on its largest scales.

It has long been assumed that galaxy formation, which started after the decoupling of

matter and energy, grew by gravitational ampliﬁcation of small density ﬂuctuations.

With the Hubble space telescope, there is evidence that galaxies were assembled z > 4

[14]. Primordial galaxies, composed of hot 1H − 4He clouds orbiting the black hole

remnants of the cold shell, were already present prior to decoupling of matter and energy

z ≈ 1100. As the universe expanded and the shell remnants separated, hydrogen was

eﬃciently removed from intergalactic space down to the Gunn-Peterson 1H limit, and

attenuated the CMBR temperature gradients as follows. Hot electrons upscattered the

redshifted photons emitted by orbiting hydrogen deeper in the protogalactic wells. With

decoupling, there are three types of scattering which accomplished this. [17] Thompson

scattering by itself can not help thermalization because there is no energy exchange

between the photons and electrons. If

σT = 8π/3(e2/m)2 ,

collisions is

λγ = (σT ne)−1 ,

is the Thompson scattering cross section, then the mean-free-path for a photon between

(3.5)

(3.6)

where ne is the number density of electrons. While traveling a distance l, the photon

will perform a random walk and undergo N collisions where N 1/2λγ = l. Since Compton

6

scattering will not change the number of photons, it will not create a Planck spectrum.

Free-free absorption at a frequency ω, is given by [17].

tf f

∼= 3(6πmT )1/2mω3/(32e6n2

eπ3)/(1 − e−ω/T ) .

For photons with a frequency ω ≈ T in electron volts,

tf f = 2x1014sec(ΩBh2xe)−2T −5/2 .

For ionization fraction xe ≈ 1,

tf f /H −1 ≈ (T /1.9x104eV )−1/2(ΩBh2)−2 .

scattering

¯t = 1.1x1011sec.T −11/4(ΩBh2Xe)−3/2 .

Thompson scattering increases the eﬀective path length for photon absorption of free-free

With primordial galaxies, free-free can dominate over Compton scattering between 90eV-

1eV, lead to true thermalization and diminish temperature gradients in the CMBR. In

FRW geometry, radiation energy ρR ∝ a−4 and T ∝ a−1. An increase in a(t) from

1013cm. to 1028cm. today would cause the corresponding temperature of CMBR would

be .00185oK, without the accretion energy released from the previous universe. Big

bang photons are thus the small tail of the thermal spectrum near absolute zero. See

for example [27] which discusses reasons for this tail. The smooth Planck spectrum at

2.73oK with δT /T ∼ 10−5 was released by accretion during the collapse of the previous

universe at a(t) ∼ 1022cm., as shown in ﬁgure 2. The photon number density cm−3

where T9 is the temperature in units of 109oK. Therefore the photon density of the big

bang is 1.29x10−7. rather than 422. This changes the baryon/photon ratio to

nγ = 2.038x1028T 3
9 ,

η = 87.6ΩBh2 ,

7

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

where h is the Hubble constant in units of 100km.sec−1Mpc−1. The explosion mechanism

and η are similar to that of a supernova. The hot baryon to photon ratio must be

multiplied by the cold baryon factor CBF plus one to obtain the total baryon/photon

ratio

ηhot(CBF + 1) = ηtotal .

(3.13)

A total η ≥ 100 will deﬁnitely close the universe with baryons. With the kind assistance

of Edward W.(Rocky)Kolb, the nucleosynthesis program NUC123 of Larry Kawano was

modiﬁed. Cold baryons were calculated by multiplying the hot baryon density thm(9)

in subroutine therm by the cold baryon multiplier. This was added to the total energy

density thm(10) and thus to the Hubble constant. The program was compiled using

the fortran77 compiler of the Absoft Corporation with the Vax compatibility option. A

double precision option for all ﬂoating point variables and disabling of overﬂow checking

allowed calculations with hot η > 1. Using cold baryons, neutrino degeneration and

η as variables,it was found that η = 10−7, a cold baryon multiplier 109 and an electron

neutrino chemical potential ξνe = 1.8 gave a D or 2H/H = 1.9x10−4 and a 4He/H = .246.
Using cold baryons allowed yields of 2H/H > 10−4. The deuterium fraction increased

with increasing cold baryons. The 4He yields decreased with increasing electron neutrino

chemical potential by reducing the neutron to proton ratio at freeze out, as ﬁrst noted

[25]. Doubling the cold baryons gave a 2H/H = 2.07x10−4 without change to other

yields. The other yields were

3H = 5.35x10−7

3He = 1.4x10−5

7Li = 1.4x10−10

N = 6.8x10−8

6Li = 4.2x10−14

7Be = 4.1x10−11

8Li + up = 1.7x10−15, .

(3.14)

These are all compatable with the standard nucleosynthesis yields except the nitrogen

fraction which has N = 5.6x10−16. The low estimate deuterium fraction now in favor

8

(1 − 2)x10−5, could be made with the same neutrino degeneration, η = 10−6 and cold

baryon factor of 109 as well as η = 10−7 and a cold baryon factor of 2x108. The last case

probably hasn’t suﬃcient baryons to close the universe.

Galaxy formation problems [19] are greatly simpliﬁed. An explosive universe with

galaxy formation will ﬁt the large scale galactic pattern [26]. Although the Jeans mass

is thought to be the point at which gravity overcomes pressure to form galaxies, massive

rotating primordial black holes may be necessary for galactic structure. In the Tully-

(3.15)

(3.17)

Fisher relation

Vc = 220(L/L⋆).22 ,

and Faber-Jackson

Vc = 220(L/L⋆).25 ,

capturing cross section

σcapt. = 16πM 2/β2 ,

where Vc is the circular velocity km/sec and L⋆ is the characteristic galaxy luminosity.

The former relation is for velocities in the dark halo of spiral galaxies and the latter for

star velocity dispersion in central parts of elliptical galaxies [20]. Rotational energy is

a function of MV 2

c . Galactic brightness results from 1H mass, Mgalaxy. The black hole

where β is the particle velocity relative to light [13]. Because of the 1H capture by pri-

mordial black holes, the brightness is proportional to the central nuclear mass M 2

nucleus.

With M 2

nucleusV 4

c = constant, MnucleusV 2

c

is constant related to the rotational energy im-

parted prior to the big bang. Thus Tully-Fisher can relate the stellar galactic mass and

luminosity to the depth of the dark matter potential well and asymtotic circular speed.

Due to the capture mechanism of 1H, the black hole nuclear mass Mnucleus ∝ Mgalaxy.

9

Galaxy formation never involved collapse dynamics with its diﬀerent post collapse den-

sities, circular speeds and disk assymetries.

The quantization of galactic redshifts found in even multiples of 37km./sec. by W.G.

Tiﬀt [22,23,24] and other workers [2,1,9] and also [3,7] is persuasive evidence that the

cold baryonic shell, which formed galactic nuclei and quasars, was present already at the

big bang. Its diﬀerent layers received diﬀerent energies from the hot expanding core, even

producing supermassive black holes. Near Abell 3627 there is a mass 5x1016M⊙ , the

Great Attractor [10], which must result from a large initial homogeneity. It may be near

the original site of the big bang. The explosion mechanism described here is apparently

that in the Hebrew Bible.

The baryon asymmetry problem has been stated as to why there are many more

baryons than antibaryons. Baryon-antibaryon pairs are only created from a vacuum at

energies > 1013oK, which is higher than the 160MeV ≈ 1.85x1012oK core temperature.

Extreme energy phenomena such as domain walls, monopoles, gravitinos and symmetry

breaking were not reached in big bang.

IV. A cyclical universe

Although equation 1 is cyclical, it is valid only for a universe that is isotropic and

homogeneous i.e. a perfect ﬂuid.

In ﬁgure 2, the maximum scale factor amax of the

universe is equal to the gravitational radius

Rg = GM/c2 ∼ 1029cm .

(4.1)

After amax was reached, the galaxies were blue shifted as they reconverged. When a(t)

was 106 smaller than today, the proportionately higher CMBR tore neutrons and protons

10

from nuclei.

In the center was a growing black hole resulting from merging galactic

nuclei. Stars and galaxies were accreted onto this supermassive black hole in a massive

thick disk. Once the mass of this black hole exceeded the size of an average galactic

nucleus ∼ 108M⊙, tidal forces were no longer capable of tearing a star apart before it

entered Rg with relatively little radiative losses [5]. The collapsing scale factor a(t) forced

all the matter and released energy inside the growing Rg in a Schwarzschild gometry.

Then Rg → 0 as the spacetime propogation of the core energy losses slowly reduced the

potential barrier of the supermassive black hole.

V. DISCUSSION

Although classical general relativity has been conﬁrmed to one part in 1012, it must

break down prior to the inﬁnite densities of singularities. There is no reason why a small

mass > 4M⊙ can contract to a singularity while the mass of universe explodes into the

big bang. If a star surface lies entirely inside the Rg, classical relativity concludes from

Kruskal-Szekeres diagrams that it must collapse to a singularity or faster than the speed

of light. Here coordinate reversal occurs, ∂/∂r is timelike (grr < 0) and proper time at

the surface

τ = −

Z

R

1/2

[grr]

dr + constant .

(5.1)

In order to allow a big bang, a reduction in the stress-energy tensor must occur before

enormous densities and energies are reached inside Rg. As T → 0, the impetus for further

collapse stops with eventual elimination of the future event horizon. After equilibrium

is established, there is re-reversal of the time coordinate and no further reduction in

size. The quantum requirement that T > 0, will not be violated as it will approach

zero on the positive side. A solution to the covariant perturbation problem for quantum

11

gravity would be as follows. The spacetime metric gab is divided into a ﬂat Minkowski

component βab and its deviation γab, where (M, ogab) is a solution to the ﬁeld equation.

The ﬁeld equation can be seen as an equation for a self interacting spin-2 ﬁeld γab in

Minkowski spacetime. In the ﬁrst order γab is a free spin-2 equation with much gauge

arbitrariness which can be expanded into a perturbation series for non-abelian gauge

ﬁelds. Although this part is non-renormalizable, the energy sink correction eliminates

this term at high energies leaving the background metric βab which satisﬁes causality

conditions. The quantum mechanism by which the energy sink suppresses vibratory

and other modes remains to be elucidated. The problem of evaporation for black holes

under a solar mass due to quantum particle creation with violation of lepton and baryon

conservation is avoided. Naked and all other singularities are mathematically eliminated.

Black holes can eventually inﬂuence their surroundings to achieve thermal equilibrium.

Thus there is no loss of quantum coherence as the ﬁnal black hole state will be a pure

one and the scattering matrix S deterministic. Supernovas < 4M⊙, when collapsing

to the same limiting density, will bounce without blackhole formation. A supranuclear

equation of state based on actual data (which does not yet exist) or more accurate

primordial deuterium ambundance would better determine the shell to core mass ratios

and the bounce temperature.

Abstract

Antoniadis, Mazur and Mottola ( AMM) two years ago computed the intrinsic Hausdorﬀ dimension of
spacetime at the infrared ﬁxed point of the quantum conformal factor in 4D Gravity. The fractal dimen-
sion was determined by the coeﬃcient of the Gauss-Bonnet topological term associated with the conformal
gravitational anomaly and was found to be greater than 4. It is explicitly shown how one can relate the
value of the Hausdorﬀ dimension computed by AMM to the universal dimensional ﬂuctuation of spacetime
ǫ given by φ3/2, where φ is the Golden Mean 0.618... Based on the infrared scaling limit of the theory and
using recent Renormalization Group arguments by El Naschie, we conjecture that the unknown coeﬃcient
Q2, associated with the four dimensional gravitational conformal anomaly, could be precisely equal to the
inverse ﬁne structure constant values ranging between 137.036 and 137.081. Our results generate decimal
digits up to any arbitrary number.

The Conformal Anomaly and Fractal Spacetime at Large Scales

Antoniadis, Mazur and Mottola [1] more than two years ago computed the intrinsic Hausdorﬀ dimension
of spacetime at the infrared ﬁxed point of the quantum conformal factor in 4D Gravity. The fractal dimension
was determined by the coeﬃcient of the Gauss-Bonnet topological term associated with the conformal
anomaly : trace anomaly and was found to be greater than 4. They also discussed a plausible physical
mechanism for the screening of the cosmological constant at very large distances in full agreeemnt with
Nottale’s work [7] and other results obtained by the present author and collaborators [6].

The Hausdorﬀ dimension for spacetime is related to the geodesic distance l(x, x′) between points x, x′
and the volume Vl enclosed by the spherical surface radius equal to l . The scaling relation between the two
is Vl ∼ ldH . For large l, this scaling relation deﬁnes the intrinsic dimension dH of the space.
associated with the Laplacian operator DµDµ and the proper time s :

In 2D quantum gravity [2,3] the most appropriate way to calculate the dH is by the heat kernel methods

K2(x, x′; s, g) =< x|e−sDµDµ

|x′ > .

(1)

The heat kernel K2 has a short distance expansion whose anomalous scaling behaviour can be calculated
based on the standard techniques pioneered by B. de Witt in the sixties. The average geodesic length-squared
that a scalar particle is able to diﬀuse after a proper time s is given by :

l2
s ≡

1
V

< Z d2x√g Z d2x′pg ′ l2K2(x, x′; s, g) >V .

(2)

where the average is taken with respect to the ﬁxed volume Liouville ﬁeld theory partition function. By
expanding the heat Kernel K2(x, x′; s; g) in a power series s one can see that

which is the standard result undergoing Brownian motion.

The relevant scaling behaviour ( with area/volume ) is the expectation value of the following quantity

appearing in the heat kernel expansion, under the conformal scalings of the metric gab = exp(2σ)¯gab :

l2
s ∼ s as

s → 0.

(3a)

s < Z d2x√g DµDµ fǫ(x, xo) >V = s < Z d2x√¯g ¯Dµ ¯Dµ ¯fǫ(x, xo) >V ∼ sV

where fǫ(x, x′) is any smooth function with support only for distances of l(x, x′) ∼ |x − x′| < ǫ. As ǫ goes
to zero it approaches a delta function : (1/√g)δ2(x − x′)
The ﬁnite area/volume scaling behaviour of the last proportionality factor follows by a constant shift
in the Liouville ﬁeld σ → σ + σo. The αn are the anomalous scaling dimensions associated with the ﬁelds of
the Liouville ﬁeld theory and are given in terms of the weights n by the formulae :

αn = n +

The authors [1] repeated this analyis associated with the conformaly anomaly in D = 4 where the
charge Q2 is now the coeﬃcient of the Gauss-Bonnet curvature squared terms present in the four dimensional
conformal anomaly :

Q2 =

(8)

the unknown charge Q2 is given in terms of the number of free scalars NS , Weyl fermions NW F and vector
ﬁelds NV F . While −28 and the unknown value of the gravitational charge Q2
grav are the contributions of
the spin-0 conformal factor and spin-2 graviton ﬁelds of the metric itself.

The scaling behaviour of the proper time under a global scaling of the volume V → λV in D = 4 is :

where βo, β8 are the conformal scaling exponents corresponding to the volume operator and the higher quartic
derivative operator ( square of the Laplacian plus curvature and other derivative terms). The Hausdorﬀ
dimension is given, in the long scale limit, by the relation :

s → λ−

then the Haussdorﬀ dimension of fractal spacetime is explicitly given by :

This ﬁnal expression for the spacetime fractal dimension is all we need to show that the unknown charge
Q2 in eq-(8) can be equated with the inverse of the ﬁne structure constant 137.036.... ( given by the Particle
data booklet ).

The authors [1] emhasized that the value of Q2 was uncertain , principally because of the unknown

infrared contributions of gravitons to the value of Q2

grav which appears in the r.h.s of eq-(8).

To calculate what the value of Q2 may be , which in turn will yield the value of Q2

grav present in the
r.h.s of (8), we conjecture that this value can be related to the inverse of the ﬁne structure constant 137.036..
based on the recent papers by the author, Granik and El Naschie [4,6] . The main results of [4] and [6] is
that there is a universal dimensional ﬂuctuation in Nature given in terms of the Golden Mean by :

∆Df luctuation = ǫ =

φ3

= φ−

= (0.618−

) = 0.118..... where φ + 1 =

1
φ ⇒ φ =

√5 − 1

2

= 0.618.... (12)

and that the inverse of the ﬁne structure constant [4] , ranging between 137.036... and 137.081.., can be
thought of as an internal dimension or a central charge, using the language of Irrational Conformal ﬁeld
Theory, as Eddington envision long ago. This line of reasoning is nothing but following the path chartered
by Einstein himself on the geometrization of all physics, with the new ingredient that we believe that Nature
is fractal at its core.

A simple numerical calculation shows that by simply setting Q2 = 137.036.... inside the basic equation
(11) yields automatically nothing more, nothing else but 4+ǫ for the Hausdorﬀ dimension of fractal spacetime
, where ǫ is the universal dimensional ﬂuctuation given by φ3/2 :

Is this a numerical concidence or design ????
El Naschie [4] has presented very convincing arguments regarding the unﬁcation of gravity with the
electroweak and strong forces, based on Renormalization Group Arguments, that there is a very deep and
explicit connection bewteen Nottale’s Scale Relativity [7] , Irrational Conformal Field theory, El Naschie’s
Cantorian-Fractal spacetime and the New Extended Scale Relativity formulated by the author [5], and
that the inverse ﬁne structure constant ( an internal dimension or charge ) plays a fundamental role in
determining the scaling regimes of the electroweak and strong interation , and the hierarchy of the 16, 6
internal dimensions, present in the Heterotic string theory and its compactiﬁcations , from 26 → 10 → 4 .
Argyris et al [8] have recently shown how a fractalization of spacetime may be an intrinsic property of all
processes in Nature, from the microworld to cosmos, having well deﬁned signatures in Cosmic Strings and
in the phenomenon of Spontaneous Symmetry breaking .

Abstract

A value given by a simple mathematical expression is proposed which is close to the ﬁne structure
constant given by 1998 CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants up to
relative accuracy 10−7. This expression relates closely with the value of the overshoot of the Gibbs
phenomenon in Fourier analysis.

Introduction

The ﬁne structure constant α is the most important dimensionless universal physical constant. Since it
is dimensionless and universal, it is very interesting to know whether it can be expressed by a simple
expression of universal mathematical constants. This may help understanding the nature.

As is known, the deﬁnition of ﬁne structure constant α is

2cǫ0h
e2 =
where c is the speed of light in vacuum, µ0 and ǫ0 = 1/c2µ0 are the permeability and permittivity of
vacuum respectively, e is the elementary charge and h is the Planck constant.

α, although it is not known
that it seems that there may be physical essence behind the relation αz ≈
presently.

In the next section, the universality of the constant Si(π) in Fourier analysis is reviewed brieﬂy. Then,
the value αz is compared with the values of α given by experiments and physical theories, which were
used to determine α for the 1998 CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants.
At last, some discussions are presented.

2 A brief review of the Gibbs phenomenon

The Gibbs phenomenon is a universal phenomenon at all the jump discontinuities for Fourier series or
Fourier transformations. First, let us look at a simple example. Let f (x) be a square wave of period 2π

Then when n

, there are overshoots and undershoots in the graph of sn (Fig. 1).

The limit of the amplitude of sn near 0 as n

is 2CG , which is CG times the jump of f (x) at 0.

This is the famous Gibbs phenomenon [2, 3, 4, 5], which was discovered more than a century ago.

The Gibbs phenomenon appears not only in the square wave, but also at all jump discontinuities
generally. For the Fourier series of any piecewisely smooth period function f (x), the limit of the amplitude
of the partial sum at a jump discontinuity x0 of f (x) equals to CG times the jump of f (x) at that point.
That is, for the partial sum sn(x),

lim
n→∞

osc
|x−x0|≤δ

sn(x) = CG lim
δ→0+

osc

sn(x)

where osc refers to the diﬀerence of the maximum and the minimum of a function. This fact is also
true for the Fourier transformation of a non-periodic function, if the function is absolutely integrable and
piecewisely smooth [5]. In all cases, the constant CG is the same.

3 Comparison with experimental values

In Fig. 2, α−1
z given by (2) was compared with the values of α−1 given by the experimental data together
with various physical theories. Each line segment in the ﬁgure represents a datum in Table XV of [1]. That
table was used to determine the value α for the 1998 CODATA recommended values of the fundamental
σ to x + σ
physical constants. For each value x with uncertainty σ, the line segment extends from x
in Fig. 2. The identiﬁcations to the right of the line segments are the same as those in Table XV of [1].
The vertical line marked α−1
represents the value given by (2) and that marked α−1 represents the value
z
given by the 1998 CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical constants.

4 Discussions

There are other theoretical values of α, such as those given by the string theory [6, 7]. For example, the
simplest expression is α−1 = φ−10−φ3
1)/2 is the golden mean. More
10−7 were also given by a complicated expansion [7]. Although the
accurate values with accuracy 3
expression α−1
in this paper is simply an observation, it is much simpler than the other theoretical results
z
with similar accuracy.

There is a small possibility that α−1

α−1 is simply an accidental coincidence. Actually it is not
diﬃcult to construct complicated relations of 2, 3, π etc. to approximate α−1 because any real number can
be approximated by a rational number to any accuracy. For example, 2−19/63157/24π−1/16 = 137.0360046.
(There is also a number 219/43−7/451/4π11/4 = 137.036082 given by Wyler [6].) However, the probability
z /Si(π) = (3π/2)3/√2 in this paper. The internal
is very small to get accidentally a simple relation like α−1
relation between αz and the ﬁne structure constant is to be revealed.

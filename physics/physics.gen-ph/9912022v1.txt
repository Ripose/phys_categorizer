About Perpetuum Mobile without Emotions.

One of the oldest science problems - possibility of the perpetuum mobile
is discussed. The interest to this problem was provoke a result, published re-
cently, which contradicts to the second law of thermodynamics. According to
this result, the thermal ﬂuctuations can induce a voltage with direct component
in a inhomogeneous superconducting ring at an unaltered temperature corre-
sponded to the resistive transition of the ring segment with the lowest critical
temperature. This result arises from obvious statements: 1) the switching of
a ring segment lb into and out of the normal state, while the rest of the ring
(segment la) remains superconducting, can induced a voltage with dc compo-
nent (It is shown that, in spite of the wide spread opinion, this statement is
correct because the superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomena);
2) the thermal ﬂuctuations switch the mesoscopic ring segment lb with lowest
critical temperature Tsb into and out of the normal state at T ≃ Tsb, while the
rest of the ring remains superconducting if Tsa > T ≃ Tsb. In order to resolve
the contradiction between these obvious statements and the second law of ther-
modynamics a possibility of the second order perpetuum mobile is considered
theoretically. It is shown that from two type of the perpetuum mobile, only
type ”b” and only in quantum systems is possible. According to the presented
interpretation, the total entropy, as the measure of the chaos, may be system-
atically reduced in some quantum system because a ”switching” between the
classical and quantum mechanics is possible. Instruction for the making of the
perpetuum mobile is enclosed.

Introduction

Physics is not lyricism. Any sentiment is inappropriate here. Nevertheless some
physical problems provoke emotion. The ﬁrst of these problems is the per-
petuum mobile. Any statement on a possibility of perpetuum mobile provokes
ﬁrst of all the sense of distrust. According to the dominant opinion this prob-
lem is once and for all decided. Almost all scientists, during more than two
centuries, are fully conﬁdent in the impossibility of any perpetuum mobile. I,
as well as other grave scientists, was sure that only madman may be in earnest
about a possibility of any perpetuum mobile. But a result, which I have ob-
tained recently, has compelled me to change my point of view. According to
this result the chaotic energy of thermal ﬂuctuation can be transformed to the
electric energy of a direct current at an unaltered temperature by means of a

1

mesoscopic inhomogeneous superconducting ring.

This result arises from obvious statements: 1) the switching of a ring seg-
ment lb into and out of the normal state, while the rest of the ring (segment
la) remains superconducting, can induced a voltage with dc component; 2) the
thermal ﬂuctuations switch the mesoscopic ring segment lb with lowest critical
temperature Tsb into and out of the normal state at T ≃ Tsb, while the rest of
the ring remains superconducting if Tsa > T ≃ Tsb. Both these statements are
agreed with our modern knowledge. But it follows directly from this statements
that the thermal ﬂuctuation can induce a voltage with dc component at an un-
altered temperature corresponded to the resistive transition of the ring segment
with the lowest critical temperature. It is obvious that the dc voltage may be
used for an useful work. This means that the useful work can be obtained from
from the heat energy) at unal-
the chaotic energy of thermal ﬂuctuation (i.e.
tered temperature (i.e.
in the equilibrium state). This possibility contradicts
directly to the second law of thermodynamic. And it is well known that a vi-
olation of the second law of thermodynamics means a possibility of the second
order perpetuum mobile.

In order to resolve this contradiction between the obvious statements and
the second law of thermodynamics I have investigated the reason of the ﬁrm
belief in the impossibility of perpetuum mobile. As a result I conclude that this
belief does not have a theoretical substantiation. Only argument against the
perpetuum mobile is numerous unsuccessful attempts to invent it. But it is not
strict argument. What could not be made yesterday can be made today. For
example, the mesoscopic superconducting ring can not be made twenty years ago
but it can be made at present. Now I am sure that the statements 1) and 2) are
correct. The second order perpetuum mobile is possible because the chaos may
be systematically reduced in some quantum system. Therefore I have published
in [1, 2] the result which contradicts to the second law of thermodynamics [3].
But it is not enough to publish such result. No one will straight oﬀ believe
that such result can be correct. Therefore I think that I ought expound in detail
my arguments. I make this in the present article. In the beginning I remind
brieﬂy the history of the considered problem. After that a brief theoretical
consideration of the perpetuum mobile problem is presented. In the section 4,
the quantum force is introduced in order to explain the dc voltage appearance
in the superconducting ring segment. In the section 5, I explain when and why
the total entropy may be systematically reduced. The last section is directions
for who want to make the perpetuum mobile.

I must write that the theoretical result published in [1] was provoked by an
experimental result. But this experimental result is not published. Therefore
the result [1] ought be considered as the theoretical prediction but not as an
explanation.

2 A few history

The perpetuum mobile is one of the oldest problems of science. This problem
is more old than almost all foundations of modern physics. Many persons at-
tempted to invent a perpetuum mobile during many centuries. Such attempts
were known beginning with 13 century. The principle of the impossibility of the
perpetuum mobile was postulated ﬁrst by Stevin (1548-1620 years). The Paris
Academy of Sciences has decided in 1775 year to do not consider any project of
a perpetuum mobile. This verdict did not have any scientiﬁc basis. The ﬁrst
and second laws of thermodynamics were formulated only in the next century.
Nevertheless, beginning with that time, almost all (with the exception of few
[4]) scientists are sure that a perpetuum mobile is impossible.

Sometimes one says that the impossibility of a perpetuum mobile is based
on the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics. But it is not quite right. It
is more right to say that the second law of thermodynamics is based on the
statement on the impossibility of a perpetuum mobile. The ﬁrst formula of this
law - Carnot’s principle - was proposed in 1824 year. Carnot wrote that the
useful work can not be obtained from the heat energy at unaltered temperature
(in the equilibrium state) because in the opposite case the perpetuum mobile is
possible. Following the Carnot’s idea Rudolf Clausius in 1850 year and William
Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1851 year have proposed the formulas which are
more known now. According to the Clausius’s formula the heat energy can
not be transferred from a cold body to a hot body without an expense of an
additional energy. According to the Thomson’s formula it is impossible to obtain
a power-driven energy (useful work) by means of a cooling of a body with lowest
temperature. The second law of thermodynamics is formulated also as the law
of entropy increase. The entropy S was introduced ﬁrst in 1865 year by Rudolf
Clausius as a value which changes on ∆S = Q/T in a reversible process when a
thermodynamic body obtains the heat energy Q (Q > 0) or gives the heat energy
(Q < 0). T is the Kelvin’s temperature of the body. Ostwald was formulated in
1877 year the second law of thermodynamics as the impossibility of the second
order perpetuum mobile. This formulas are equivalent and are used for the
present. But the modern interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics,
as well as the entropy, diﬀer in essence from the old one dominated in the last
century.

According to the both interpretation the entropy value, S, can not decrease
in a closed thermodynamic system. It does not change in the reversible pro-
cess and increases in irreversible process. Any thermodynamic system tends
to the equilibrium state corresponding to a greatest S value. But there is the
diﬀerence between old and modern deﬁnition of the entropy which causes some
contradiction between old and modern interpretation of the second law of ther-
modynamics.

According to the Clausius’s deﬁnition, the temperatures of parts of any ther-
modynamic system can not diﬀer in the equilibrium state. If the temperatures

3

diﬀer, T1 > T2, the entropy increases ∆S = Q/T2 − Q/T1 when the heat energy
Q is transferred from a hot (with T = T1) to a cold (with T = T2) part of the
system. Consequently, the state with T1 > T2 is not equilibrium. According to
the old interpretation the heat energy ﬂows only from a hot to a cold part and
any dynamic process (any transfer of the heat energy) does not take place in
the equilibrium state.

Following to L.Boltzmann, J.W.Gibbs and others we deﬁne now the entropy
by the relation S = kB ln P . Here kB is the Boltzmann constant; P is the
statistical weight proportional to a number of microscopic states and to the
probability of macroscopic state. The maximum entropy corresponds to the
maximum probability: P = exp(S/kB). It is easy to show (see [5]) that the
number of microscopic states P1 at T1 = T2 is higher than P2 at T1 > T2
(at the same total internal energy). We could make the conclusion from this
statement that the modern deﬁnition of the entropy is agreed with the Clausius’s
deﬁnition. But on other hand, P1 + P2 > P1. The thermodynamic system can
not be at the same time in the diﬀerent states, with T1 = T2 and T1 > T2. But
it can goes between these states. This process is well known as the thermal
ﬂuctuation. The heat energy is transferred from a part to other part of any
thermodynamic system at T > 0. The Q transfer from a cold T2 to hot T1
part of a system is hardly probable if −∆S = −(Q/T1 − Q/T2) ≫ kB. But
the probability ∝ exp(Q/kBT1 − Q/kBT2) of this transfer in opposite direction
does not diﬀer strongly if Q|T2 − T1|/kBT1T2 < 1 (i.e. the Clausius’s formula of
the second law of thermodynamics is correct to an accuracy of ∆S = kB). The
ﬂuctuations contradict to the old interpretation. Therefor they were interpreted
as the violation of the second law of thermodynamics in the beginning of our
century [6]. Evidence of the ﬂuctuation existence was one of the reasons why
the modern interpretation has won the old interpretation. According to the
modern interpretation, the second law of thermodynamics has probabilistic but
not reliable nature. We know now that dynamic processes take place in the
equilibrium state at T > 0. But these processes are chaotic. According to the
modern interpretation, the second law of thermodynamics is the law of chaos
increase. And the entropy is interpreted now as a measure of the chaos.

The second law of thermodynamics was formulated in order to describe the
transformation of a heat energy Q to an useful work A in the heat engine.
Scientists understood that the mechanical (power-driven) energy is dissipated
completely in the heat at any work in a consequence of the friction, Emech →
A → Q. Proceeding from the impossibility of the perpetuum mobile Carnot
has shown in 1824 year that the heat energy can not be transformed completely
to the mechanical energy. A heater with Theat and a cooler with Tcool < Theat
should be in any heat engine, according to Carnot. A work body obtains the
heat energy Q1 from the heater at T = Tmax ≤ Theat and gives the heat energy
to the cooler at T = Tmin ≥ Tcool. According to the Carnot’s law, the eﬃciency
Ef = A/Q of any heat engine can not exceed Efmax = 1 − Tmin/Tmax. This
law is considered now as the consequence of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics

4

A = Q1 − Q2 and of the second law of thermodynamics ∆S = Q2/Tmin −
Q1/Tmax ≥ 0. The Emax is realized in a reversible regime when ∆S = 0. But
these laws of thermodynamics were formulated later than the Carnot’s law.

According to the Carnot’s law, Efmax = 0 in the equilibrium state and the
total heat energy is systematically increased at the work because the mechanical
energy dissipated in the heat energy can not be restored completely. There-
fore we must use a fuel in order to obtained the useful work. The Carnot’s
law remains without change to our time although it’s substantiation and in-
terpretation were changed qualitatively. According to the old interpretation
the work can not be obtained at Tmax = Tmin because any dynamic pro-
cess is absent in the equilibrium state. According to the modern knowledge
the heat is the chaotic motion. The chaotic dynamic processes take place in
any thermodynamic system at T > 0. The Carnot’s law is connected now
with the law of chaos increase. The total entropy, as the measure of the
chaos, may be systematically reduced if the heat engine is possible in which
Ef = A/Q1 > Efmax = 1 − Tmin/Tmax. The reduction of the entropy at the
transformation of the heat energy to the mechanical energy (or other form of
ordered energy Eord), Ef Q1 → A =
dXFord → Eord, is not completely com-
pensated by the transfer of the heat energy Q2 from the heater to the cooler if
Ef = A/Q1 > Efmax. (Eord is, for example, the kinetic energy of a ﬂywheel
or the magnetic energy LI 2/2 in a solenoid.) The chaos increase, taken place
at the dissipation of the ordered energy Eord → A =
dXFdis → Qdis, may
be completely compensated if Ef > Efmax. (The dissipative force Fdis is, for
example, the friction force retarding the ﬂywheel or the force decreasing the cur-
rent value I in the solenoid when it’s resistance is not equal zero.) Consequently,
the heat engine with Ef > Efmax is the second order perpetuum mobile: the
useful work could be obtained anyhow long time without any fuel. According to
the opinion dominated now, it is impossible because the total chaos can not be
reduced. This belief, as well as the second law of thermodynamics in the old in-
terpretation, is founded on the postulate of the perpetuum mobile impossibility.
This postulate has long and rich history and, may be, therefore does not have
a theoretical substantiation. This problem ought be considered theoretically at
last.

3 Theory of Perpetuum Mobile

A possibility of a perpetuum mobile means that the useful work can be obtained
anyhow long time T . At the useful work, as well as at any other work, an
energy is transferred from a part to other part of the system. The work A is
the product of a force F into a distance dX, A =
dXF . Because dX = vdt,
T
R
A =
0 F vdt/T is the average by
the time T of the product of the force F into the velocity v. Consequently, a
perpetuum mobile is possible if a process exists in which the average < F v > by

T
0 dtF v = T < F v >. Here < F v >=

R

R

anyhow long time T is not equal zero. If F is the total force of a closed system
and < F v >6= 0 then the ﬁrst order perpetuum mobile is possible. < F v >6= 0
contradicts to the law of energy conservation (the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics).
I can not doubt the this law. Therefore I, as well all other scientist, am fully
conﬁdent in the impossibility of the ﬁrst order perpetuum mobile. Let turn to
the second order perpetuum mobile.

Both the conventional heat engine and the second order perpetuum mobile
do not create a new energy. They put in order the chaotic heat energy. Because
the ordered energy is dissipated at any real work Eord → T < Fdisv >→ Qdis
the heat energy should be transformed in the ordered energy Qdis → T <
Fordv >→ Eord in order the work can take place any long time.

< Fordv >6= 0 in two cases: a)if < Fordv >6=< Ford >< v >, or b) if both
< Ford >6= 0 and < v >6= 0. Thus, two type of both heat engine and second
order perpetuum mobile may be: type ”a”, when < Fordv >6=< Ford >< v >
and type ”b”, when < Fordv >=< Ford >< v > but both < Ford >6= 0 and
< v >6= 0. The case a) takes place if the force F and the velocity v are corre-
lated. This correlation takes place in a conventional heat engine. For example,
the pressure in a steam-engine has diﬀerent value when a piston is moved in
opposite directions. Therefore < Fordv >6= 0 although < v >= 0 because
< Fordv >6=< Ford >< v >. But in order to achieve this correlation an con-
trolled heat ﬂow is used in any conventional heat engine. Such ﬂow is possible
only in the inequilibrium state. Therefore the total entropy increases both at
the ordered process and at the dissipation process. This process can not be any-
how long (inﬁnite) time because the state of thermodynamic system is changed:
the total entropy increases. The heat energy Qdis can not be transformed com-
pletely in the ordered energy. Therefore any conventional heat engine is not the
perpetuum mobile. The total state of the thermodynamic system should not
change during the work of the second order perpetuum mobile. Therefore it
should work in the equilibrium state because only in this state the total entropy
value does not increase in time.

F 6= 0 in the equilibrium state only because of the ﬂuctuation. The ﬂuc-
tuation is chaotic.
In a chaotic process < F v >= m < vdv/dt >= m <
dv/dt >< v >=< F >< v >. There is a mathematical problem to prove that
< vdv/dt > − < v >< dv/dt >= 0 if the function v(t) is chaotic. This proof is
evidence of the impossibility of the type ”a” perpetuum mobile.

Our last hope to invent the perpetuum mobile is the case ”b”. It is obvious
that < v >= 0 in any classical (no quantum) system where all states are per-
mitted. (There is used the reference system in which the total momentum of
the considered thermodynamic system is equal zero). The probability of a state
P is proportional to exp −(E/kBT ). The energy E of a state is function of v2 in
a consequence of the space symmetry. Therefore the probability P (v) = P (−v)
P (v)v + P (−v)(−v) = 0 if all states are permitted. This ar-
and < v >=
gument may be considered as a theoretical substantiation of the verdict made
by the Paris Academy of Sciences. The quantum mechanics was not known in

P

1775 year.

But it can not be considered as the evidence of the impossibility of the type
”b” perpetuum mobile in our time because no all states are permitted according
to the quantum mechanics. Therefore < v >6= 0 in some quantum systems. One
of such systems is the mesoscopic superconducting ring considered in [1, 2]. As
a consequence of the relation (see [7])

Here Φ0 = π¯hc/e is the ﬂux quantum; A is the vector potential; m is the elec-
tron mass and e is the electron charge; l = 2πr is the ring circumference; r is
the ring radius; Φ =

l dlA is the magnetic ﬂux contained within the ring.

At Φ/Φ0 6= n and Φ/Φ0 6= n + 0.5 the permitted states with the opposite
directed velocity have diﬀerent values of the kinetic energy Ekin = mv2
s /2.
For example at Φ/Φ0 = 1/4 the lowest permitted velocities in a homogeneous
superconducting ring are equal vs = −¯h/mR4 at n = 0 and vs = 3¯h/mR4
at n = 1. The kinetic energy of these states diﬀer in 9 times. Therefore the
thermodynamic average of the velocity < vs > is not equal zero. It is important
that the motion of the superconducting condensate is circular. It is obvious the
type ”b” perpetuum mobile is possible only at a circular motion. Only in this
case the position of the work body (superconducting condensate in the case of
the considered ring) does not change without limit during anyhow long time at
< v >6= 0.

Thus, the result published in [1, 2] may be correct if an ordered force Ford
exists the average value of which < Ford > is not equal zero in the equilibrium
state. Such force exists. It acts at the closing of the superconducting state in
the ring and is connected with the quantization of the generalized momentum
of superconducting electrons along the ring circumference. Therefore I will call
it as quantum force.

4 A quantum force

According to the statement 1) (see Introduction) the switching of a ring segment
lb into and out of the normal state, while the rest of the ring (segment la)
remains superconducting, can induced a voltage with dc component < Vb >6= 0.
la + lb = l = 2πr. This statement means that the dc voltage exists both on

But it is well known [7] that superconducting state diﬀers from the state with
inﬁnite conductivity because the superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum
phenomena. The < p >l value can change at the transition to the supercon-
ducting state. Electrons are accelerated against the force of the electric ﬁeld in
this case. This takes place, for example, at the Meissner eﬀect, the Little-Parks
eﬀect and other quantization phenomenon.

In order to describe these phenomenon using the language of the classical
mechanics a quantum force Fq should be introduced,
dtFq =< ∆p >l. <
p >l= (e/c)Φ/l = (e/c)BS/l when the ring in the normal state, because <
v >l= 0. The < p >l value does not change when a ring segment la is switched
into the superconducting state and other segment lb is remained in the normal
state, nsa > 0 and nsb = 0. nsa and nsb are the densities of superconducting
electrons in the segments la and lb. This corresponds to the laws of the classical
mechanics and does not require of the quantum force. Contradiction with the
classical mechanics appears at the closing of the superconducting state in the
ring (when nsa > 0 and nsb > 0) because the momentum 2p = ¯h ▽ φ =
2mvs + 2e
c A (see (1)) and the velocity of superconducting pair (see (2)) are
quantized if the superconducting state is closed. The average momentum <

permitted values when nsa > 0 and nsb > 0. Therefore the average momentum
should be change on < ∆2p >l= (2e/c)(nΦ0 − BS)/l at the closing of the
superconducting state if the magnetic ﬂux within the ring is not divisible by the

The momentum < 2p >l returns to the initial value during the decay time
L/Rnb after the transition of the segment lb in the normal state. Here Rnb =
ρbnlb/s is the resistance of the segment lb in the normal state. This process
corresponds to the laws of the classical mechanics. The velocity < ve >l in
the segment lb is decreased because of the dissipation. Therefore a charge q =
dt(Ia − Ib) on the boundaries of the segments la and lb and, as a consequence,
R
the potential diﬀerence Va and Vb appear. The electric ﬁeld Ea = − ▽ Va −
(1/c)dA/dt retards the superconducting electrons in the segment la and Eb =
−▽Vb−(1/c)dA/dt counteracts of the dissipated force Fdis = −eEb+mdve/dt in
the segment lb. The voltage Ea has the same direction after the transition of lb
both in the superconducting and normal states: the superconducting electrons
are accelerated against Ea after the transition to the superconducting state
and are retarded by Ea after the transition to the normal state. Consequently
< Va >6= 0. Thus, in spite of the wide spread opinion, the direct voltage can
exist on the superconducting segments of the ring.

The quantum force acts both in inhomogeneous and in homogeneous rings.
At the transition to the superconducting state of a homogeneous ring the elec-

cording to the Tinkham’s explanation [9] of this eﬀect, the critical temperature
of a superconducting tube with narrow wall depends in a periodic way on the

the kinetic energy of superconducting electrons changes periodically with the

a principal new in comparison with the Tinkham’s explanation. We may say:
”the Tc depends on Φ because the quantum force should be overcome at the
superconducting transition if Φ 6= nΦ0”. And we may say: ”the Tc depends on Φ
because the energy of the superconducting state increases if Φ 6= nΦ0”. These
statements are equivalent. Timkham did not consider the magnetic energy

the classical mechanic, the quantum force may be introduced also. But this de-
scription is not so obvious as in the case of the inhomogeneous superconducting
ring. The Meissner eﬀect is more intricate phenomenon than the quantization
of the ﬂuxoid: n is not any integer number, but n = 0.

It is obvious that the direct voltage can appear only in the inhomogeneous
case when the dissipating force Fdis acts only in a segment of the ring. The
quantum force Fq accelerates electrons both in the la and in the lb segments

component is induced in the ring segments. The Fq acts only if the Fdis acts.
It returns the average momentum to the same value < 2p >l= (2e/c)(Φ0/l)n.
The < 2p >l value changes only at the switching of the segment lb into and out
of the normal state. Any other changes of the superconducting electron density
(nsa and nsb) do not inﬂuence on this value.

5 When and Why the Total Entropy may be

Systematically Reduced

The appearance of the direct voltage means that the inhomogeneous supercon-
ducting ring can be used as a direct-current generator. The current in a resistor
Rload loaded on the segment lb is Iload = RbIa/(Rb +Rload). After the transition
of the segment lb in the normal state with Rb = Rbn the current Ia in the seg-
ment la decreases exponentially from Is determined by the relation (3a) during
the decay time L/Rsys, where Rsys = RbnRload/(Rbn + Rload). Consequently

the power-driven energy Asw =
s /2)
can develop across the load Rload at the switching of the segment lb. The power
Wload = Aswf = (Rbn/(Rbn + Rload))FLf . Here f = 1/N is the frequency of

load = (Rbn/(Rbn + Rload))(LI 2

the switching; N is the average number of the switching in a time unity.

Because the power Wload may be utilized for a useful work and the segment
lb may be switched by the temperature change, the superconducting ring may be
used as the heat engine. The ordered force in this heat engine is the quantum
force Fq. The Fq direction coincides with the direction of the velocity vs of
superconducting electrons. Whereas the dissipating force is directed against
the velocity. The work done by the quantum force
dtvsFq increases
the ordered energy: the kinetic energy of superconducting electrons and the
energy of magnetic ﬁeld LI 2
s /2. A part of this ordered energy may be used for
a useful work and other part is dissipated in the ring after the lb switching into
the normal state. The energy is dissipated completely if the load is absent i.e.
1/Rload = 0.

There is not a contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics if the
segment lb is switched in a consequence of a temperature change above and
below Tcb [2]. The heat energy Qsw = cb∆T should be spent for the heating
of the segment lb from Tmin = Tcb − ∆T to Tmax = Tcb. Here cb is the heat
capacity. Because Is ∝ nsb ∝ (Tcb − T ), the work Asw ∝ (Tmax − Tmin)2. Con-
sequently, the maximum eﬃciency Ef = Asw/Qsw of the ring as a heat engine
is proportional to (Tmax − Tmin). This is agreed with both the old and modern
interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. But the superconducting
ring diﬀers qualitatively from the conventional heat engine because it can work
without correlation between Ford and v, i.e. it is not the type ”a” heat engine,
as the conventional heat engine, but is the type ”b” heat engine. It can work
at both a ordered and chaotic switching of the segment lb.

The section lb can be switched chaotically by the thermal ﬂuctuation at
an unaltered temperature (at Tmax = Tmin ≃ Tcb).
It is well known [7, 10]
that the resistance of a superconductor R < Rn in some region above Tc and
R > 0 in some region below Tc because superconducting droplets (with charac-
teristic size ≃ ξs(T )) appear in the normal state and normal droplets (phase-
slip centers) (with characteristic size ≃ ξn(T )) appear in the superconducting
state in the consequence of the thermal ﬂuctuation. The coherence lengths
ξs(T ) = ξ(0)(T /Tc − 1)−0.5 at T > Tc and ξn(T ) = ξ(0)(1 − T /Tc)−0.5 at
T < Tc in the linear approximation valid at |T − Tc| ≫ GiTc. Gi is the Gins-
burg number. We are interested here the one-dimensional case, in which the
transverse dimensions of superconductor are small compared with the coher-
ence length (w < ξ, s < ξ2). In this case the ξs(T ) has a ﬁnite value at T < Tc,
which increases with temperature decreasing. ξs(T ) ≃ ξn(T ) at T ≃ Tc

The probability of the switching at T ≃ Tcb of the segment lb in the normal
state is much bigger than the one of the segment la if Tca > Tcb ≃ T . Therefore
the inhomogeneous superconducting ring is switched by the ﬂuctuation from
closed (nsa > 0, nsb > 0) to open (nsa > 0, nsb = 0) superconducting state
at an unaltered temperature corresponded to the resistive transition of the ring
segment with the lowest critical temperature. As it was shown above, the voltage
appears at this switching if Φ/Φ0 6= n. The probability of the closing is enough

11

high if lb ≃ ξs(T ). The voltage is chaotic at Φ/Φ0 = n + 0.5, because the
switching induced by the ﬂuctuation is chaotic in time and the quantum force
acts in opposite directions with equal probability. This case does not diﬀer
qualitatively from other ﬂuctuation phenomena, for example from the Nyquist’s
noise [11]. The power of the chaotic voltage is ”spread” on all frequencies ω as
well as at the Nyquist’s noise, the power of which is proportional to a frequency
band ∆ω: < V 2

N yq > /R = 4kBT ∆ω [5].

The qualitative diﬀerence from the completely chaotic ﬂuctuation eﬀects
(such as the Nyquist’s noise) takes place at Φ/Φ0 6= n + 0.5. n can be any
integer number, but the state with minimum |n − Φ/Φ0| value has a maximum
probability, because the energy of this state is minimum. Therefore the average
T

value of the quantum force by a long time T is not equal zero:
R
sw. P (|n − Φ/Φ0|)(2e/c)(nΦ0 − Φ)/lN 6= 0 at Φ/Φ0 6= n and Φ/Φ0 6= n + 0.5.

R
not completely chaotic (Vb(ω = 0) =< Vb >6= 0) although it is induced by the
chaotic switching. This obvious consideration leads to result published ﬁrst in
[1].

This result means that a part p(Φ/Φ0) of the chaotic electric energy induced
by thermal ﬂuctuation can be ordered in the inhomogeneous superconducting
ring. p(Φ/Φ0) = 0 at Φ/Φ0 = n or Φ/Φ0 = n + 0.5 and 0 < p(Φ/Φ0) < 1 at
Φ/Φ0 6= n and Φ/Φ0 6= n + 0.5. The direct voltage V (ω = 0) 6= 0 can appear
only in an inhomogeneous ring because in a homogeneous ring the switching is
chaotic not only in time but also in space. Diﬀerent segments of the ring are
switched in diﬀerent time (if l ≫ ξ(T )). Therefore < V >= 0. In a mesoscopic
ring with l < ξ(T ) the switching takes place simultaneously in the whole ring.
Therefore the potential diﬀerence is equal zero.

The power of the energy regulating in the inhomogeneous superconducting
ring is Word = p(Φ/Φ0)Aswfsw. Asw < FL and the maximum frequency of
the switching fsw is determined by the characteristic relaxation time of the
superconducting ﬂuctuation: fsw ≤ 1/τrel.. Therefore Word < p(Φ/Φ0)FL/τrel..
The ﬂuctuations induce the magnetic energy FL ≃ µkBT /(1 + µ), where kBT
is the characteristic energy of the thermal ﬂuctuation; µ/(1 + µ) is the part of
FL in whole change of the superconductor energy. µ has the maximum value
µ = (32π3/κ2)(Ls/l3
b )(n − Φ/Φ0)2 at T = Tc. This relation is valid for a ring
with s ≪ λ2
L. Here κ = λL/ξ is the superconductor parameter introduced in the
Ginsburg-Landau theory; λL is the London penetration depth of the magnetic
ﬁeld. In the linear approximation region at T > Tc, τrel. = τGL = ¯h/8kB(T −Tc)
(see [10]). The probability of the switching from into and out of the normal state
is not small only in the critical region, i.e. at |T − Tc| < GiTc. Therefore the
maximum power of the energy regulating in the inhomogeneous superconducting
ring may be estimated by the relation

This power is very weak. Even for a high-Tc superconductor with Tc ≃ 100K,
(kBTc)2/¯h ≃ 10−8W t.

Thus, the mesoscopic superconducting ring, switched by the ﬂuctuation into
and out of the closing superconducting state, may be considered as the second
order perpetuum mobile of type ”b”. But the ring without a load are useless
perpetuum mobile because the energy both is ordered and is dissipated inside
it. Moreover, it is perpetuum mobile only in the old interpretation, which was
revised in the beginning of our century together with the interpretation of the
second law of thermodynamics. ”Perpetuum mobile” is literally permanent
motion. According to modern knowledge the permanent motion takes place at
any nonzero temperature. The voltage inside the ring, as well as the Nyquist’s
noise, is one of the examples of this permanent motion.

This permanent motion is not perpetuum mobile according to the modern
interpretation. It contradicts to old but not to modern interpretation of the
second law of thermodynamics. According to the old interpretation, the en-
tropy decreases at the closing of the superconducting state and increase at the
transition to normal state of the segment lb. But according to the modern inter-
pretation, the switching by the ﬂuctuation does not change the entropy value,
because both the closed and open superconducting state are included to the
statistical weight P . The entropy, as the measure of chaos, does not change
both at < Vb >= 0 and at < Vb >6= 0 if whole magnetic energy LI 2
s /2 induced
by the quantum force is dissipated in the segment lb after it’s transition to the
normal state, i.e. < Fq >< vs > + < Fdis >< v >= 0.
In this case, the
situation in the inhomogeneous superconducting ring does not diﬀer from the
one in a homogeneous ring or at the Meissner eﬀect.

Nevertheless the permanent motion in the mesoscopic superconducting ring
diﬀers qualitatively from other types of the permanent motion because it is
partly ordered at < Fq >< vs > > 0. Therefore the potential chance exists to
utilize this permanent motion for the useful work. In order to realize this chance
the direct potential diﬀerence induced in the inhomogeneous superconducting
ring by the quantum force should be put under load. The inhomogeneous su-
perconducting ring with a load is the perpetuum mobile not only according
to the old interpretation, but also the modern interpretation. It is the useful
perpetuum mobile. In this case no whole magnetic energy is dissipated in the
segment lb. A part develops across the load. This process contradicts to the
Clausius’s formula if a temperature of the load is higher than the one of the ring.
It contradicts to the Carnot’s principle and the Thomson’s formula if the load
is an electricmotor. The total entropy (total chaos) is reduced when the heat
energy is transformed in a ordered energy, ∆Q → tWord → Eord, because the
reduction of the entropy ∆S = −∆Q/T = −Eord/T can not be compensated
in the equilibrium state for the transfer a heat energy from a heater to a cooler

13

because Theat = Tcool in this state. The transformation ∆Q → tWord → Eord
can take place anyhow long time. At tWord ≫ kBT , ∆S ≫ kB.

The useful work can be obtained in the load because the voltage induced
by ﬂuctuation is partly ordered, Vb(ω = 0) =< Vb >6= 0, in the inhomogeneous
superconducting ring. There is qualitative diﬀerence, for example, from the
Nyquist’s noise [11], the power of which can not be used for a useful work because
it is chaotic. It is impossible also to transfer any energy of the Nyquist’s noise
from a cold resistor to a hot resistor. The second law of thermodynamics can
not be broken when the chaotic voltage is put under a load. The power of the
Nyquist’s noise is not summed up: the power of one resistor < V 2
N yq > /R =
4kBT ∆ω is equal the one of N resistors < V 2
N yq > /N R = 4kBT ∆ω. Whereas
the power Word can be summed up: the direct voltage on a system of N rings,
the segments of which with lowest critical temperature are connected in series,
is equal N < Vb >. The power Wmax (see (5)) corresponds to the power of the
Nyquist’s noise in the frequency band ∆ω = p(Φ/Φ0)(µ/(1 + µ))2Gi(kBTc/¯h).
This ∆ω may be enough wide. At p(Φ/Φ0)(µ/(1 + µ))2Gi ≃ 1, ∆ω ≃ kBTc/¯h ≃
1013 sec−1 at Tc = 100K.

The statement on the possibility of the perpetuum mobile is not new in
essence. In the beginning of our century scientists have come to the conclusion
that the perpetuum mobile, as the permanent motion of energy, takes place in
any thermodynamic system at T > 0. The new statement in the my consid-
eration is the possibility of regulating of this motion in some quantum system.
This chaos reduction is connected with the quantum force, which has a funda-
l dl¯h ▽ φ is ”bad” (no gauge-invariant) quantum value
mental cause:
R
if l is not a closed path, and it is ”good” (gauge-invariant) value if l is a closed
path. We may say that the quantum force acts at a ”transition” from classical
to quantum mechanics. It can be introduced because the dualism of electron.
We can use the relation mdv/dt = F because the superconducting electrons are
particles. But these particles can accelerate against the classical forces because
the electron is wave.

l dlp =
R

It is obvious that the entropy, as measure of the chaos, decreases at the
”transition” from the classical to quantum mechanics. Planck has introduced
in 1900 year the quantization in order to reduce the number of microscopic
states from inﬁnite to ﬁnite value. Therefore one may say that the perpetuum
mobile is possible because the ”switching” between the classical and quantum
mechanics is possible.

It was become obvious in the beginning of our century that the second law
of thermodynamics in the old interpretation is correct to kBT . The violation of
the second order of thermodynamics in the modern interpretation has also the
fundamental limit. Because the characteristic energy of ﬂuctuation kBT and
the time of any cycle can not be shorter than ¯h/kBT in accordance with the
uncertainty relation, the power of any perpetuum mobile

Wp.m. < (kBT )2/¯h

(6)

14

We may say that the second law of thermodynamics is correct to (kBT )2/¯h.

6 How to Make the Perpetuum Mobile

In order to make the perpetuum mobile, the modern methods of the nano-
technology should be used. Sizes of the ring segment with lowest critical tem-
perature should not surpass strongly the coherence length of the superconduc-
tor. Other sizes of the ring should be also enough small. Because the power
of a ring is very weak, Wmax < (kBTc)2/¯h, a system with big number of the
rings should be used in order to obtain an acceptable power. The useful power
Wload = N 2 < Vb >2 Rload/(Rload + N Rb)2 can be obtained by the system of N
rings the segments lb of which are connected in series. This power has maximum
value Wload = N < Vb >2 /4Rb at Rload = N Rb. Because the sign and the value
of < Vb > depend on n − Φ/Φ0 = n − BS/Φ0, the area S of all rings should
be the same. The ﬂuctuations induce < Vb > only in a narrow region near Tcb.
Therefore the critical temperature of all rings should be approximately identi-
cal. All rings should be identically inhomogeneous Tcb < Tca. The requirement
Tcb < Tca can be realized in the ring with diﬀerence areas of wall section la
and lb, sb < sa. In accordance with the Little-Parks eﬀect Tcb(Φ) < Tca(Φ) at
sb < sa if Φ/Φ0 6= n.

Because Wmax ∝ T 2

c a system of high-Tc superconductor (HTSC) rings has
maximum power. In order to obtain Wload ≈ 1 W t the system of no less than
4 108 HTSC rings should be used. But it is very diﬃcult to make the HTSC
rings with enough small sizes. The coherence length of all known HTSC is
very small. Therefore the conventional superconductor rings (for example Al
rings) ought be used for ﬁrst experimental investigation. The expected volt-
age < Vb > < (RbWmax)1/2 ≃ (p(Φ/Φ0)8Giµ/(1 + µ))1/2R
is
small but measurable. For example at Tc = 1 K and a real value Rb = 1 Ω,
≃ 10−6 V = 1 µV . (p(Φ/Φ0)8Giµ/(1 + µ))1/2 ≤ 1 in any case.
R
This value depends in the periodic manner on the magnetic ﬁeld (with period
∆B = Φ0/S) and is not equal zero only at the temperature closed to Tcb.

The perpetuum mobile can not solve the energy problem.

It’s power is
very weak. But the system of superconducting rings may be used in some
applications.
It can used simultaneously as the direct-current generator [12]
and as the micro-refrigerator [13]. The perpetuum mobile can work anyhow
long time without an expense of any fuel. Therefore it may be especially useful
in self-contained systems.

Abstract

A rigorous quantum relativistic approach has been used to calculate the re-
lationship between the decay laws of an unstable particle seen from two inertial
frames moving with respect to each other.
In agreement with experiment, it
is found that the usual Einstein’s time dilation formula is rather accurate in
this case. However, small corrections to this formula were also obtained. Al-
though the observation of these corrections is beyond the accuracy of modern
experiments, their presence indicates that special relativistic time dilation is not
rigorously applicable to particle decays.

Introduction

Unstable particles are a perfect testing ground for theories that try to unify the princi-
ple of relativity with quantum mechanics for (at least) two reasons. First, an unstable
particle provides a very simple example of a non-trivial interacting quantum system.
Due to the speciﬁc initial condition characteristic to this problem (there is just one
particle in the initial state), a rigorous description of the decay is possible in a small
Hilbert space that contains only states of the particle and its decay products, so the
solution can be obtained in a closed form. Second, unstable particles played an impor-
tant role in conﬁrming predictions of Einstein’s special relativity. It was demonstrated
experimentally that the decay of moving particles slows down in a good agreement
with Einstein’s time dilation formula [1, 2].

For a long time it was believed that relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum
ﬁeld theory must reproduce exactly the Einstein’s time dilation formula for unstable
particles [3]. However, a detailed quantum relativistic calculation in [4] has shown

1

that there are small corrections to this formula in the case of particles with deﬁnite
momentum. This result was later conﬁrmed in other studies [5, 6]. Although sur-
prising, these ﬁndings did not challenge directly the applicability of special relativity
to unstable systems. This is because relativistic transformations connect results of
measurements of two inertial observers moving with constant velocities with respect to
each other. Then a fair comparison with the time dilation formula requires considera-
tion of unstable states having deﬁnite values of velocity for both observers. Such states
do not have a deﬁnite momentum for, at least, one observer. Their decay laws were
considered in recent article [7] which alleges that the decay accelerates when particle’s
velocity increases, instead of being slowed down as experiment shows. In the present
article we resolve this controversy by performing a detailed calculation of the decay
laws of particles with narrow distributions of velocities observed from moving reference
frames. We found that the result of [7] is based on an incorrect identiﬁcation of the
subspace of states of the unstable particle in the full Hilbert space of the system. In
sections 5 - 7 we present a rigorous quantum relativistic framework required for the
description of decays. The exact formula for the time dependence of the non-decay
probability in a moving inertial frame of reference is derived in section 8. Particular
cases of this formula relevant to unstable particles with sharply deﬁned momenta or
velocities are considered in sections 9 and 11, respectively. Section 12 is devoted to
numerical calculations of the diﬀerences between the accurate quantum mechanical
result and the standard time dilation formula (9). Although these diﬀerences are much
smaller than the resolution of modern experiments, their presence is in sharp contra-
diction with special relativity which does not tolerate even small deviations from the
Einstein’s time dilation.

Formulation of the problem

The decay of unstable particles is described mathematically by the non-decay proba-
bility which has the following deﬁnition. Suppose that we have a piece of radioactive
material with N unstable nuclei prepared similtaneously at time t = 0 and denote Nu(t)
the number of nuclei that remain undecayed at time t > 0. Then the non-decay prob-
ability1 ω(0, t) (also called the non-decay law in this paper) is deﬁned as the fraction
of nuclei that survived the decay in the limit of large N

ω(0, t) = lim
N→∞

Nu(t)/N

(1)

So, at each time point the piece of radioactive material can be characterized by its
Nu(t)/N), where Nu(t)/N is the share of undecayed nuclei
composition (Nu(t)/N; (1

unstable particles as an ensemble of identically prepared systems and consider ω(0, t)
as a property of a single particle (nucleus), i.e., the probability of ﬁnding this particle
in the undecayed state.

In this paper we are concerned with comparison of decay observations made by two
observers O and O′ that move with respect to each other. Without loss of generality
we will assume that observer O′ moves with respect to O with velocity (0, 0, v) along
the z-axis and that at time t = 0 measured by both observer’s clocks the origins of
their coordinate systems coincide and all three pairs of coordinate axes are parallel
x′, etc.). For discussion purposes we will say that O is at rest while O′ is moving.
(x
To simplify formulas we will use the rapidity parameter θ = tanh−1(v/c) instead of
velocity v. For example, in this notation the famous relativistic factor takes the form
v2/c2)−1/2 = cosh θ. If from the point of view of O the decay is described by
γ
the function ω(0, t), then the non-decay law of the same particle seen by the moving
observer O′ will be denoted by ω(θ, t).2 Calculation of this function and, in particular,
the relationship between ω(θ, t) and ω(0, t) is the major goal of this work.

3 Postulates of relativity

The purpose of any relativistic theory is to describe the relationships between measure-
ments made by diﬀerent inertial observers or from diﬀerent inertial reference frames,
i.e., reference frames moving in space with constant velocities along straight lines and
without rotation. The special principle of relativity tells us that these reference frames
are exactly equivalent

•

Postulate I. Experiments identically arranged and performed in two diﬀerent
inertial reference frames O and Q always yield the same results.

For any two observers O and Q there is an inertial transformation that connects Q to
O, i.e., the set of rules that allows one to change from the reference frame O to the
reference frame Q. Each inertial transformation is a combination of space and time
translations, rotations and boosts. A composition of two inertial transformations is
again a valid inertial transformation. This composition obeys the associativity law.
The inverse of an inertial transformation is also an inertial transformation. Therefore,
they form a 10-parameter Lie group. The structure of this group is speciﬁed in the
second postulate

•

Postulate II. Inertial transformations (space and time translations, rotations,
and boosts) form the Poincar´e group.

2Note that here parameter t denotes time measured by the clock belonging to the observer O′.

3

Obviously, two diﬀerent observers obtain diﬀerent results by measuring observables
of the same physical system. Most problems in physics can be understood as trans-
lations of descriptions of the physical system between diﬀerent reference frames. For
example, if we have a full description of the system from the point of view of observer
O, then the time evolution is obtained by answering the question “what is the descrip-
tion of the same system from the point of view of observer O′′ that is shifted in time
with respect to O?” It is important to realize that inertial transformations between
observers can be divided into two groups: kinematical and dynamical. Kinematical
transformations are those whose action on observables does not depend on the inter-
action. For example, if two stationary observers look at the unstable particle from
diﬀerent points in space, they would assign the same non-decay probability to the par-
ticle. The same is true for stationary observers having diﬀerent orientations in space.
From this follows3

Postulate III. Space translations and rotations are kinematical.

•

•

On the other hand, time translations produce non-trivial changes in the system. The
composition of the unstable system looks diﬀerent for observers O and O′′ shifted in
time with respect to each other. The exact action of time translations on observables
of the physical system should be obtained as a result of solution of dynamical equations
which depend on the interaction acting in the system. Hence the following postulate
is true for all types of isolated interacting systems.

Postulate IV. Time translations are dynamical, i.e., interaction-dependent.

The above postulates I - IV have overwhelming experimental support. They are
assumed to be valid throughout this paper. However they are not suﬃcient for a full
description of the unstable particle in a moving reference frame. Such a description
requires also knowledge of the nature of boosts. Here we have a choice between two
paths forward. One path is to postulate certain properties of boosts. This path was
taken by Einstein. It leads to special relativity and to the time dilation formula (9) as
explained in the next section. In this paper we will argue in favor of choosing another
path: keep postulates I - IV, add to them well-established postulates of quantum
mechanics, and see what are the implications for the transformations of observables
(in particular, the non-decay probability) with respect to boosts. This approach is
employed starting from section 5 throughout the paper.

3Our adoption of this postulate means that we are working in Dirac’s instant form of relativistic
dynamics [8]. Other forms of dynamics, e.g., the point form and the front form, were also introduced
by Dirac and are frequently used for description of relativistic interactions. As discussed in section
13, these forms are not appropriate for the description of non-decay laws of unstable particles.

4 Particle decay in special relativity

In addition to postulates I - IV, Einstein’s special relativity makes two more assump-
tions regarding the nature of boosts

Assumption V. Boosts are kinematical.

•

By postulating the kinematical character of boosts, special relativity insists that the
internal composition of a compound system does not depend on the velocity of the
observer. For example, if O and O′ are two observers moving with respect to each other,
then, according to special relativity, both observer will measure the same composition
of the unstable system at time t = 0. These statements are often considered as self-
evident in discussions of special relativity. For example, R. Polishchuk writes in [9]
“Any event that is “seen” in one inertial system is “seen” in all others. For example if
observer in one system “sees” an explosion on a rocket then so do all other observers.”
In addition to the universality and interaction-independence of boost transformations,
special relativity also postulates the exact transformation laws of physical observables
with respect to boosts. They are referred to as Lorentz transformations. The most
fundamental are Lorentz transformations for space-time coordinates of events.4

•

Assumption VI. If from the point of view of observer O an event is localized
in a space point (x, y, z) at time t, then from the point of view of observer O′ the
same event has space-time coordinates (t′, x′, y′, z′) given by Lorentz formulas

Let us now demonstrate that in special relativity the Postulates I - IV and As-
sumptions V - VI are suﬃcient to unambiguously describe particle decay in diﬀerent
reference frames without invoking any information about the interaction governing the
decay. Suppose that from the point of observer O the unstable system is prepared in
4By event we understand a measurable physical process occuring at a certain point in space at one
time instant. An intersection of trajectories of two point-like classical particles is an example of such
an event. Note that in quantum mechanics the deﬁnition of event is problematic as particles do not
have well-deﬁned trajectories. Moreover, it is known that a particle sharply localized from the point
of view of the observer O loses its localization from the point of view of the moving observer O′ [10].
So, Assumption VI can be applied only in the classical limit.

the state with composition (1.0; 0.0) at rest in the origin x = y = z = 0 at time t = 0.5
Then observer O may associate the space-time point

(t, x, y, z)prep = (0, 0, 0, 0)

with the event of preparation.
In accordance with the dynamical character of time
translations, the non-decay probability ω(0, t) decreases with time. From experiment
and quantum mechanical calculations (see, e.g., section 12) it is known that the non-
decay law has an (almost) exponential shape6

ω(0, t)

exp(

≈

t
τ0

)

−

where τ0 is the lifetime of the unstable particle. At time t = τ0 the non-decay prob-
ability is exactly e−1, so that the composition is (0.368; 0.632). This “one lifetime”
event has coordinates

(t, x, y, z)lif e = (τ0, 0, 0, 0)

according to the observer O.

Let us now take the point of view of the moving observer O′. Due to the Assumption
V, both O and O′ agree that at the “preparation” and “lifetime” events the non-decay
probabilities are 1 and e−1, respectively. However, observer O′ may not agree with
O about the space-time coordinates of these events. Substituting (6) and (8) in (2)
- (5) we see that from the point of view of O′, the “preparation” event has coordi-
nates (0, 0, 0, 0), and the “lifetime” event has coordinates (τ0 cosh θ, 0, 0,
cτ0 sinh θ).
Therefore, the time elapsed between these two events is cosh θ times longer than in
the reference frame O. This also means that the decay law of the particle is exactly
cosh θ slower from the point of view of the moving observer O′. This is reﬂected in the
famous “time dilation” formula

notions “at rest” and “in the origin” cannot be used simultaneously.

certainly a triumph of Einstein’s theory. However, as we see from the above discussion,
in special relativity eq. (9) can be derived only under two assumptions V and VI,
which lack proper justiﬁcation. Therefore, a question remains whether eq. (9) is a
fundamental exact result or simply an approximation that can be disproved by more
accurate measurements?

Our goal in the rest of this paper is to demonstrate that this classical result of
special relativity is not exact. In section 12 we will calculate corrections to the formula
(9).

5 Quantum mechanics of particle decays

Let us now turn to the description of an isolated unstable system from the point of
view of relativistic quantum theory. In our approach we will keep postulates I - IV.
However, we are not going to use Assumptions V and VI.

We will consider a model theory with particles a, b, and c, so that particle a is
massive spinless and unstable, while its decay products b and c are stable and their
masses satisfy the inequality

ma > mb + mc

(10)

→

which makes the decay a
b+c energetically possible. In order to simplify calculations
and avoid being distracted by issues that are not relevant to the problem at hand we
neglect the spin of the particle a and assume that there is only one decay mode of this
particle, i.e., into two decay products b and c. For our discussion, the nature of the
particle a is not that important. For example, this could be a muon or a radioactive
nucleus or an atom in an excited state.

When measuring the non-decay law, experimentalists simply count the number of
particles and determine their types. For example, observations of a muon may result in
only two outcomes. One can ﬁnd either a non-decayed muon or its decay products (an
electron, a neutrino, and an antineutrino). Thus the number of particles is a legitimate
observable, and for our model system a
b + c we can introduce Hermitian operators
for the number of particles Na, Nb, and Nc. Since these observables can be measured
simultaneously, we can assume that these three operators commute with each other.
Two combinations of their common eigenvalues are allowed in our system:

→

na = 1, nb = 0, nc = 0
na = 0, nb = 1, nc = 1

We can now introduce a Hermitian operator T (also known as “yes-no experiment”)
that corresponds to the observable “particle a exists”. The operator T can be fully
deﬁned by its eigensubspaces and eigenvalues. When a measurement performed on the
unstable system ﬁnds it in a state corresponding to the particle a (i.e., the state vector
Ha), the value of T is 1. When the decay products b + c are observed (the

J is the operator of the total angular momentum. The generator of time translations
H is the Hamiltonian (total energy). The generator of boosts K is called the boost
operator. These generators must satisfy the commutation relations of the Poincar´e
group Lie algebra. In this paper we will need, in particular, the following commutators

lated in the Fock space where integer eigenvalues na, nb, and nc are allowed to take any values from
zero to inﬁnity. However, for most unstable particles the interaction between the decay products in
the ﬁnal state can be ignored, and considering the subspace (13) of the full Fock space is a resonable
approximation.

6 Non-interacting representation of the Poincar´e

group

Before calculating the non-decay law in the moving reference frame (21), let us ﬁrst
consider a simpler case when the interaction responsible for the decay is “turned oﬀ”.
Then the representation of the Poincar´e group U 0
is non-interacting. This
representation is constructed in accordance with the structure of the Hilbert space (13)

ing to particles a, b, and c, respectively. The generators of the representation (23) are
denoted by P0, J0, H0, and K0. The operator of non-interacting mass

commutes with P0, J0, H0, and K0. According to (10), the operator M0 has a contin-
uous spectrum in the interval [mb + mc,

interval.

Interacting representation of the Poincar´e group

Let us now “turn on” the interaction responsible for the decay and discuss the inter-
with generators P, J, K, and
acting representation Ug of the Poincar´e group in
H. According to our postulates III and IV, the generators of space translations and
rotations are interaction-free,

while the generator of time translations (the Hamiltonian H) contains an interaction-
dependent term V .

From the commutator (15) it then follows [8] that the generators of boosts must be
interaction-dependent as well

where W
= 0. This means that we are working in the so-called Dirac’s instant form of
dynamics. We will further assume that the interacting representation Ug belongs to the
Bakamjian-Thomas form of dynamics [14], which is characterized by the property that

special relativity to particle decays. However, at a closer inspection it appears that this
result does not contradict Einstein’s time dilation formula (9) directly. Formula (9)
refers to observations made on the same particle from two frames of reference moving

but is not an eigenstate of the momentum operator P0. Therefore, strictly speaking,
its non-decay law is not described by ω|p)(0, t). In order to compare with Einstein’s
formula (9), we need to calculate the decay law in the moving frame of reference
ω|Ψi(θ, t). This is done in section 11.

10 Decays caused by boosts

Let us now discuss the non-decay probability ω|Ψi(θ, 0) at t = 0 in the moving frame of
reference. Instead of eq. (47), it is more convenient to use the general deﬁnition (22)
which expresses ω|Ψi(θ, 0) as the square of the norm of the projection of

This is the “decay caused by boost”. Thus we found that Assumption V from section 4
is not correct. Sometimes this assumption is formulated as [15] “Flavor is the quantum
number that distinguishes the diﬀerent types of quarks and leptons. It is a Lorentz
invariant quantity. For example, an electron is seen as an electron by any observer,
never as a muon.” Although the above statement about the electron is correct (because
the electron is a stable particle), this is not true about the muon which, according to
(55) can be seen as a single particle by the observer at rest and as a group of three
decay products (an electron, a neutrino, and an antineutrino) by the moving observer.

11 Decay law in the moving reference frame

Unfortunately exact evaluation of eq. (47) for θ
= 0 is not possible, so we need to make
approximations. Let us discuss properties of the initial state
in more detail. First,
in all realistic cases this state is not an eigenstate of the total momentum operator, so
the wave function is not localized at one point in the momentum space (as assumed
and, correspondingly an
in (50)) but has a spread (or uncertainty) of momentum
uncertainty of position
i ∈ Ha is not
an eigenstate of the mass operator M, and
is characterized by the uncertainty of
mass Γ (see Fig. 1) that is related to the lifetime of the particle τ0 by formula (49). It
is important to note that in all cases of practical interest the mentioned quantities are
related by inequalities

In particular, the latter inequality means that the uncertainty of position is mush less
than the distance passed by light during the lifetime of the particle. For example,

the spread of the particle wavefunction in the momentum space rather than by its mass uncertainty

and the actual non-decay law (60) of a moving particle having either deﬁnite mo-
mentum or sharply deﬁned speed.
In these calculations we assumed that the mass
2 of the unstable system (see eqs. (43) - (44) and Fig. 1) is centered
distribution
at the value of mass ma = 1000 MeV/c2, the total mass of the decay products was
mb + mc = 900 MeV/c2, and the width of the mass distribution was Γ= 20 MeV/c2.
These values do not correspond to any real particle, but they are typical for strongly
decaying baryons.

It is convenient to measure time in units of the classical lifetime τ0 cosh θ. Denoting
χ
t/(τ0 cosh θ), we ﬁnd that Einsteinian non-decay laws (62) for any value of θ are
given by the same universal function ωclass(χ). This function was calculated for values
of χ in the interval from 0 to 6 with the step of 0.1 The calculations were performed by
direct numerical integration of eq. (48) using the Mathematica program shown below

{t, 0.0, 6.0, 0.1}]

As expected, function ωclass(χ) is very close to the exponent e−χ.21 Next we used eq.
(60) and the above Mathematica program to calculate the non-decay laws ω|0](θ, χ)
in moving reference frames for three values of the parameter θ (=theta), namely
0.2, 1.4, and 10.0, that correspond to velocities of 0.197c, 0.885c, and 0.999999995c,
respectively. These calculations qualitatively conﬁrmed the time dilation formula (62)
21This function is represented by a thick solid line in Fig. 2. The magnitudes of ωclass(χ) for small

values of the argument χ are too large to be shown on the scale of Fig. 2.

The lifetime of the particle a considered in our example (τ0 ≈

10−22 s) is too
short to be observed experimentally. So, calculated corrections to the Einstein’s time
dilation law have only illustrative value. However, from these data we can estimate
the magnitude of corrections for particles whose time-dependent non-decay laws can

proportional to the ratio Γ/ma [4, 6], we can expect that for muons the maximum
10−18 which is much smaller than the accuracy of
correction should be about 2
modern experiments (about 10−3 [2]). So, experimental observation of the predicted
corrections requires signiﬁcant improvements of existing experimental techniques.

Note that formulas (60) and (61) for the particle seen from the moving frame are
approximate in the sense that they ignore the “decay caused by boost” expressed by
eq. (56). Nevertheless, our major approximation (57) is well justiﬁed and it cannot
explain the disrepancy of our results (Einsteinian time dilation of the decay plus small
interaction-dependent corrections) with the conclusion of ref. [7] about the acceleration
of the decay of moving particles.
In our view this conclusion does not refer to the
experimentally measured non-decay law that is deﬁned as the probability of ﬁnding

13 Particle decays in diﬀerent Dirac’s forms of dy-

namics

In this article we assumed that the interaction responsible for the particle decay has the
Bakamjian-Thomas instant form of dynamics. This assumption was used to simplify
calculations, but there is no good reason to believe that real interactions have this
form. Then, naturally, one may ask a question: “Is there another form of dynamics
in which Einstein’s time dilation formula (9) is exactly true?” The answer is No.
In any instant form of dynamics (including non-Bakamjian-Thomas instant forms of
dynamics) the boost operators contain interaction terms, so the results (55) - (56) are
still valid, and eq. (9) holds only approximately. In the point form dynamics23 the
Ha of the unstable particle is invariant with respect to boosts, so there can
subspace
be no boost-induced decays (55). However, due to the interaction-dependence of the
total momentum operator P, one should expect decays induced by space translations

This prediction is not conﬁrmed by experiments which show that the composition of
an unstable particle is not aﬀected by space translations of the observer.24 Therefore,
the point form of dynamics is not acceptable for the description of decays. Similarly,
never observed translation- and/or rotation-induced decays are characteristic for all
non-instant forms of dynamics, e.g., the front form. Therefore only the instant form of
dynamics is appropriate for the description of particle decays. Note, however, that the
decay slowdown and the absence of translation-induced decays are ﬁrmly established
only for unstable systems whose lifetimes are long enough to be measured experi-
mentally, i.e., those governed by electromagnetic and weak interactions. For strongly
interacting resonances these properties are beyond experimental resolution, and the
non-instant forms of dynamics cannot be ruled out.

23where generators of boosts K0 and rotations J0 are kinematical, while generators of space trans-

lations P and time translations H contain interaction terms.

24An even more striking contradiction between predictions of the point form dynamics and observa-
tions is that the decay of moving particles accelerates cosh θ times instead of experimentally observed
slowdown [4].

14 Summary

In this paper we analyzed the relationships between the non-decay laws in the moving
reference frame and in the reference frame at rest. We used a rigorous quantum
relativistic approach that is applicable to any unstable system independent on the
nature of interaction governing the decay. A complete description of dynamics in
diﬀerent reference frames was obtained by using relativistic Postulates I - VI and rules
of quantum mechanics only. We found that Assumptions V and VI of special relativity
are not needed. Moreover, their consequences (the universal and exact time dilation of
the decay of moving particles) are in contradiction with rigorous calculations. Although
the time dilation (9) of special relativity was qualitatively conﬁrmed by our results, we
also found small corrections to this formula that depend on the strength of interaction.
In a broader sense our results indicate that clocks viewed from the moving reference
frame do not go exactly cosh θ slower. The exact amount of time dilation depends on
the physical makeup of the clock and on interactions responsible for the operation of
the clock.

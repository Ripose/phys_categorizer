Abstract

It is generally believed that quarks being conﬁned inside nucleons should
make their presence felt explictly in nuclei only at higher energies. However
it is shown here that the hole in the centre of 3H, 3He and 4He, the neutron
halos in nuclei, the α
and other clustering eﬀects in nuclei and the nuclear
molecules all basically arise due to the same underlying quark eﬀects. Also
the role of triton clustering in very neutron rich nuclei is emphasized. These
require the concept of hidden colour states which arise from the conﬁnement
ideas of QCD for the multi-quark systems.

−

In contrast to the popular belief that nucleonic degrees of freedom are
all that is required for a consistent description of the ground state and low
energy properties of nuclei, it is shown here that there are speciﬁc nuclear
eﬀects wherein no way that one can do without invoking the quark degrees of
freedom. A claim shall be made that only within the nucleonic and mesonic
degrees of freedom these eﬀects can just not be described consistently. This
will allow us to make clearcut predictions which can help establish the ve-
racity of the claims made herein [1].

The eﬀects that we shall concentrate upon are , the hole at the centre of
3H, 3He and 4He [2,3], the neutron halo nuclei [4,5], the clustering eﬀects in
nuclei [6,7,8,9] and the nuclear molecules [9,10]. As we shall see below, this
would require an understanding of two or more nucleons strongly overlapping

1f m. This would necessarily imply a study of multi-
over a small region of
≤
1f m. This would lead to the concept of hidden
quark states in regions
colour [11]. There have been some claims [12] that hidden colour may not
be a useful concept as these coloured states may be rewritten in terms of
asymptotic colour singlet states. Below, we shall show that this is not always
true. In special circumstances, as shall be discussed here, hidden colour are
unambiguously deﬁned states, basic to physics under consideration.

≤

As we shall be discussing the structure of nuclei in the ground state, we
should also have the structure of nucleons in the ground state as well. Hence
we view the nucleon as consisting of 3 constituent quarks in the s-state.
Another point that should be borne in mind is that though the r.m.s. radius
of nucleon is 0.8 fm, it is a very diﬀuse system with matter distribution given
by ρ(r) = ρ0 exp (
mr) and hence matter extends signiﬁcantly beyond 0.8
fm.

Why does deuteron not have conﬁgurations where the two nucleons over-
1f m to form 6-quark bags ? Why is deuteron
lap strongly in regions of size
such a big and loose system ? The reason has to do with the structure of
the 6-q bags formed had the two nucleons overlapped strongly. As per the
colour conﬁnement hypothesis the 6-q wave function looks like [11] :

≤

6q >=

1X1 > +

(1)

where ’1’ represents a 3-quark cluster which is singlet in colour space and
8X8 > is overall
’8’ represents the same as octet in colour space. Hence
colour singlet. This part is called the hidden colour because as per conﬁne-
ment ideas of QCD these octets cannot be separated out asymptotically and
so manifest themselves only within the 6-q colour-singlet system. This part
was found to be 80% and this would prevent the two nucleons to come to-
gether and overlap strongly [11]. Therefore the hidden colour would manifest
1f m in deuteron. So the two
itself as short range repulsion in the region
nucleons though bound, stay considerably away from each other [2,3].

≤

There has been misundersatnding regarding hidden colour in nuclear
physics. A few scientists have claimed [12] that hidden colour may not be
a useful concept as these hidden colour states can be rearranged in terms
of asymptotic colour singlet states. It was pointed out in ref. [12] that the
hidden colour concept is not unique only when the two clusters do not over-
lap strongly and asymptotically can be separated out. However when the

2

clusters of 3-q each overlap strongly so that the relative distance between
them approacehs zero then the hidden colour concept becomes relevant and
[11]. We would like to point out that indeed, this
unique as shown in ref.
necessarily is the situation for deuteron discussed above. Also note that for
the ground state the quark conﬁguration is s6 given by conﬁguration space
representation [ 6 ] while s4p2 given by [ 42 ] does not come into play as there
is not enough energy to put two quarks into the p-orbital [13].

The author had earlier obtained group theoretically the hidden colour
components in 9- and 12-quark systems [ 2,3]. For the ground state and low
energy description of nucleons we assume that SU(2)F with u- and d-quarks
is required. Hence we assume that 9- and 12-quarks belong to the totally
antisymmetric representation of the group SU(12)
SU(3)C
where SU(3)c is the QCD group and SU(4)SF
SU(2)S where
S denotes spin. Note that up to 12-quarks can sit in the s-state in the
group SU(12). The calculation of the hidden colour components for 9- and
12-quark systems requires the determination of the coeﬃcients of fractional
SU(3) [ 1,2 ] which becomes quite
SU(4)
parentage for the group SU(12)
complicated for large number of quarks. The author found that the hidden
colour component [ 1,2 ] of the 9-q system is 97.6% while the 12-q system is
99.8% ie. is almost completely coloured.

What is the relevance of these 9- and 12-quark conﬁgurations in nuclear
physics ? The A=3,4 nuclei 3H, 3He and 4He have sizes of 1.7 fm, 1.88 fm
and 1.674 fm respectively. Given the fact that each nucleon is itself a rather
1f m at the centre of these nuclei the
diﬀuse object, quite clearly in a size
≤
3 or 4 nucleons would overlap strongly. As the corresponding 9- and 12-q
are predominantly hidden colour, there would be an eﬀective repulsion at
the centre keeping the 3 or 4 nucleons away from the centre. Hence it was
predicted by the author [2,3] that there should be a hole at the centre of 3H,
3He and 4He. And indeed, this is what is found through electron scattering
(see [1,2 ] for references ). Hence the hole, ie. signiﬁcant depression in the
central density of 3H, 3He and 4He is a signature of quarks in this ground
state property.

Neutron halos have been discovered in several neutron rich nuclei like
6He,11 Li,11 Be,14 Be etc. [4,5]. For example the rms radius of 11Li is 3.2 fm
while that of 9Li is 2.3 fm. Hence in this halo nuclei it is believed that 2n
are very loosely bound to a compact core of 9Li. So also the 2n in 6He etc.
It would be fair to say that as of now the halo structur is an unexplained

3

and puzzling problem in nuclear physics.

As to 4He it is a very strongly bound system with binding energy of 28.29
MeV. It is a compact object of size 1.674 fm. Due to speciﬁc quark hidden
1f m at the centre.
colour state, as we discussed above, it has a hole of size
Thus it has a signiﬁcantly higher density at the boundary and very small at
the centre. Hence 4He is like a tennis-ball. Add two more neutrons to 4He to
make it 6He, a bound system. This is like adding 2 neutrons to a tennis-ball
nucleus. As the two neutrons approach the surface they will bounce oﬀ. As
the two neutrons are bound, these will ricochet on the compact tennis-ball
like nucleus. A neutron halo would be manifested as these neutrons shall be
kept signiﬁcantly away from the core.

Macroscopically, as the density of the 4He core is high on the boundary,
any extra neutrons would not be able to penetrate as this would entail much
larger density on 4He surface than the system would allow dynamically. Mi-
croscopically, any penetration of extra neutron through the surface of 4He
would necessarily imply the existence of ﬁve or six nucleons at the centre.
As already indicated due to the relevant SU(12) group only 12-quarks can
sit in the s-state, which already is predominantly hidden colour. Any extra
quarks hence would have to go to the p-orbital and in the ground state of
nuclei, there is not suﬃcient energy to allow this. Hence the two neutrons are
consigned to stay outside the 4He boundary. In addition if at any instant the
two neutrons come close to each other while still being close to the surface,
locally the system would be like three nucleons overlapping and looking like
a 9-q system. This too would be prevented by the local hidden colour repul-
sion. Hence as found experimentally the two neutrons in the halo would not
come close to each other [4,5].Hence the neutron halo in 6He is due to quark
eﬀects [1]. About other neutron (and proton) halo nuclei we shall discuss
shortly.

Clusters, especially 4He ones have a very important role in nuclear struc-
tures [ 5,6,7,8 ]. Clusters are crucial for studies of light nuclei like 8Be,7 Be,
6Li,7 Li,12 C,16 O. Even for heavier nuclei like 20Ne,24 Mg,28 Si,44 T i and oth-
ers they are important [ 5,6,7,8 ]. It is commonly stated that 4He clusters
are formed in nuclei because it is so strongly bound, ie. 28.29 MeV. Here
we would like to point out that 4He forms good clusters because in addition
it has a hole at the centre so it is like a tennis-ball. These balls in a bound
system of several 4He nuclei would bounce from each other.

The reason for resistance to inter-penetration of two α clusters would be

4

hidden colour repulsion of the relevant 6-, 9- and 12-quark systems plus the
fact that more than 12 quarks are not permitted in the lowest s- state in the
group SU(12).

Let us treat 12C as 3α cluster with the α’s sitting at the vertices of an
equilateral triangle. Because of tennis-ball like structure the three α par-
ticles cannot come too close to each other. Firstly, the surface of the ball
would prevent it and secondly if some part of the 3 α ’s still overlap at the
centre, it would look like a 6- or 9-quark system. Therein the hidden colour
components would repel ensuring that the 3 α clusters do not approach too
closely at the centre. This too would imply a depression in the central den-
sity of 12C. Indeed, from the density distribution determination by electron
scattering, this is so in 12C.
16O treated as 4α sitting at the vertices of
a regular tetrahedron would, for the reasons stated above, too have a cen-
tral density depression, again as seen in the electron scattering. Due to the
central depression, C 12 and 16O would appear tennis-ball like as well [1].

In our picture 16O of 4 α at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron is special.
Just as 4He with 12-q structure at centre is special due to the degeneracies
of the group SU(12) so also 16O with 4 α is special for the same reason. For
20Ne the ﬁfth α would not just penetrate 16O but would try to form a regular
tetrahedron locally with any of the 3 α surface of the 4 α cluster. Similarly
we can keep on adding α ’s until 32S where 4 α ’s are sitting on top of four
3 α clusters surfaces of 16O. Hence for α’s 5 to 8 it is close packing on top
of 4 α’s of 16O which has a hole at the centre. Hence all these nuclei should
have hole at the center. Beyond 8 α clusters, the geometry is such that the
9th α - particle cannot be simply close packed on top of 32S.

It has been shown here that the 12C with 3 α and 16O with 4 α has
central density depression. Though the eﬀect may be softened compared to
3H, 3He as 3N and and 4He as 4N ball structures, nevertheless these nuclei
should also act tennis-ball like. No wonder one observes nuclear molecules in
C-C, C-O, O-O systems. The stability of nuclear molecules has to do with
the bounciness of the C,O nuclei coupled with the fact that their large size
is due to the largeness of the constituent clusters. Also obviously molecular
structures would exist for nuclei 20Ne,24 Mg,U 28 Si and 32S [9,10]. Hence
nuclear molecules [9,10] too arise basically due to quark eﬀects [1].

So far we have explained neutron halo nuclei 6He as arising due to 2n
ricochet oﬀ the stiﬀ tennis-ball like core of 4He. In addition, nuclei like 12C
are made up of 3 ball like α’s and also develops ball like properties. What

happens when 2n are added to it ? Could one have two neutron halos for
14C ? This is not so. The reason is because of the following. Going through
the binding energy systematics of neutron rich nuclei one notices that as the
number of α’s increases along with the neutrons, each 4He + 2n pair tends
to behave like a cluster of two 3
1H2 is
somewhat less strongly bound (ie. 8.48 MeV ) it is still very compact (ie. 1.7
fm ), almost as compact as 4He (1.674 fm). In addition it too has a hole at
the centre. Hence 3H is also tennis-ball like nucleus. This splitting tendency
of neutron rich nuclei becomes more marked as there are fewer and fewer of
4He nuclei left intact by the addition of 2n. Hence 7Li which is 4He +3 H
with 2n becomes 9Li which can be treated as made up of 3 3H clusters and
should have hole at the centre. Similarly 12Be consists of 4 3
1H2 clusters and
15B of 5 3
1H2 clusters etc. Other evidences like the actual decrease of radius
as one goes from 11Be to 12Be supports the view that it ( ie 12Be ) must be
made up of four compact clusters of 3H.

Note that just as several light N=Z nuclei with A=4n, n=1,2,3,4 ... can
be treated as made up of n α clusters, in Table 1 we show several neutron
rich nuclei which can be treated as made up of n 3
1H2 clusters. We can write
the binding energy of these nuclei as [1]

Eb = 8.48n + Cm

(2)

Here n 3

1H2 clusters form m bonds and where C is the inter-triton bond
energy. We have assumed the same geometric structure of clusters in these
nuclei as for α clusters of A = 4n nuclei as given above. All the bond
numbers arise due to these conﬁgurations. We notice from Table that this
holds good and and that the inter-triton cluster bond energy is approximately
5.4 MeV. This value seems to work for even heavier neutron rich nuclei. For
example for 42Si the inter-triton cluster energy is still 5.4 MeV. Notice that
the geometry of these cluster structures of 3H becomes more complex as the
number increases but nevertheless still holds good.

What we are saying is that these neutron rich nuclei, made up of n number
of tritons, each of which is tennis-ball like and compact, should be compact
as well. These too would develop tennis-ball like property. This is because
the surface is itself made up of tennis-ball like clusters. Hence as there are
no more 4He clusters to break when more neutrons are added to this ball of
triton clusters, these extra neutrons will ricochet on the surface. Hence we

expect that one or two neutrons outside these compact clusters would behave
like neutron halos. Therefore 11Li with 9Li + 2n should be two neutron halo
nuclei - which it is [ 3,4 ]. So should 14Be be [ 3,4 ]. It turns out that internal
dynamics of 11Be is such that it is a cluster of α
t ( which also has to do
with 9Li having a good 3 α cluster) with one extra neutron halo around it.
Next 17B,19 C,20 C would be neutron halo nuclei and so on [1]. These speciﬁc
predictions of quark signatures in nuclei are eaily testable.

Z A2Z are made up of Z 3

Thus all light neutron rich nuclei 3Z

1H2 clus-
ters. Due to hidden colour considerations arising from quark eﬀects, all
these should have holes at the centre. This would lead to tennis-ball like
property of these nuclei. One or two (or more) extra neutrons added to these
core nuclei would ricochet on the surface of the core nucleus and form ha-
los around it. All known and well-studied neutron halo nuclei ﬁt into this
pattern. This makes unambiguous predictions about which nuclei should be
neutron halo nuclei and for what reason. At the base, it is quarks which
cause neutron halo [ 3,4 ]. The proton halo nuclei can also be understood
in the same manner. Here another nucleus with a hole at the centre 3
2He1
(binding energy 7.7 MeV, size 1.88 fm) would play a signiﬁcant role.

So it should be clear now that it is quarks through hidden colour conﬁg-
uration lead to a hole at the centre of 3H, 3He and 4He. As the relevant
group is SU(12) no more than 12 quarks can sit in the lowest orbital. Hence
the hole at the centre of 4He is special. Clustering of these nuclei is also
determined by their bouncing tennis-ball like property. This gives new in-
sight into α
clustering in nuclei and predicts existence of clusters of triton (
and helion ) nuclei. All these nuclei are themselves compact and tennis-ball
like. One, two or more neutrons outside these nuclei ricochet to give halo
like structures. Large nuclear molecules can also be understood in the same
manner. Hence these should be treatd as unique quark signatures in nuclei.

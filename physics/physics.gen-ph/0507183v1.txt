Abstract

Classical model SDcl of the Dirac particle SD is constructed. SD is the
dynamic system described by the Dirac equation. For investigation of SD and
construction of SDcl one uses a new dynamic method: dynamic disquantiza-
tion. This relativistic purely dynamic procedure does not use principles of
quantum mechanics. The obtained classical analog SDcl is described by a sys-
tem of ordinary diﬀerential equations, containing the quantum constant as a
parameter. Dynamic equations for SDcl are determined by the Dirac equation
uniquely. The dynamic system SDcl has ten degrees of freedom and cannot be
a pointlike particle, because it has an internal structure. Internal degrees of
freedom appears to be described nonrelativistically. One discusses interplay
between the conventional axiomatic methods and the dynamical methods of
the quantum systems investigation. In particular, one discusses the reasons,
why the internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle and their nonrela-
tivistic character were not discovered during eighty years.

1 Introduction

In the framework of axiomatic presentation of quantum mechanics there exist no
formal procedure of transition to classical approximation. The classical description
is obtained from the quantum one, when we set, that the quantum constant ¯h = 0.
Unfortunately, we cannot obtain the classical approximation for the Schr¨odinger
SS, setting ¯h = 0 in the action for the Schr¨odinger particle. This action has
particle

If we set ¯h = 0 in the action (1.1), the description degenerates. Such a degenera-
tion is conditioned by the artiﬁcial use of the quantum constant in the action (1.1).
SS the action
The fact is that at the natural description of the Schr¨odinger particle
contains two independent constants: dynamical constant b and quantum constant ¯h.
The dynamical constant b is simply an arbitrary constant of integration, which can
take any nonvanishing value. At such a natural description the quantum constant
¯h describes the quantum eﬀects, and quantum description transits to the classical
one, if one sets ¯h = 0.

The natural description is obtained from the action (1.1) by means of the trans-

We underline that the actions (1.1) and (1.7) describe the same dynamic system
in diﬀerent dependent variables. The action (1.7) contains two parameters b and ¯h,
whereas the action (1.1) contains only one parameter ¯h.

Description in terms of Ψb is a natural description, because, the constant ¯h
describes the quantum eﬀects, and setting ¯h = 0 in the action (1.7), we obtain the
action for the statistical ensemble of free classical particles (this fact will be proved
hereinafter in Appendix A)

If we identify parameters b and ¯h in (1.7) - (1.9), we obtain the artiﬁcial descrip-
tion (1.1) - (1.4), where setting ¯h = 0, we set simultaneously b = 0 and the descrip-
tion degenerates. At the artiﬁcial description the dynamic term and the quantum
term of the dynamic equation are compensated, and the dynamic equation becomes
to be linear. This is the main advantage of the artiﬁcial description.

Description of the Dirac particle is also artiﬁcial in the sense, that it is degen-
erate at ¯h = 0. Unfortunately, the transformation of the kind (1.6) is unknown in
SD, and we are forced to look for another approach to
the case of the Dirac particle
the derivation of the classical approximation. We use dynamical methods of inves-
tigation. It means the investigation of the dynamic system
SD simply as a dynamic
system without a use of quantum principles. Such an approach admits one to ob-
tain classical approximation of
SD by means of some dynamical procedure, which
does not contain a reference to the quantum constant ¯h. This procedure (dynamical
disquantization) is insensitive to the form of application of the quantum constant
(natural or artiﬁcial). The dynamical disquantization is a special case of dynamical
methods, applied to the investigation of quantum systems. We manifest application
of dynamical methods in the example of the Schr¨odinger particle

SS.

2 Dynamical methods of investigation

We use the mathematical technique, which is more developed, than conventional
formalism of quantum mechanics. This technique supposes that all essential infor-
mation on the quantum dynamical system is contained in the dynamic system itself.
Such speciﬁc quantum concepts as the wave function and principles of quantum me-
chanics appear to be only the means of description. The wave function as the means
of description may be applied to both quantum and classical dynamic systems. But
the quantum principles may be applied only to quantum dynamic systems, because
they contains some constraints, which are not satisﬁed for classical systems. The
quantum system and classical system distinguish dynamically (in additional terms
in the action), but not in the way of description. This fact becomes to be clear,
when both systems are described in the same terms. For instance, the quantum
system and the corresponding classical system may be described in terms of the
wave function, or both systems may be described in terms of the particle position
and momentum.

Progress in the development of the mathematical technique has a mathematical
ground: integration of dynamic equations. This pure mathematical achievement has
physical consequences. It appears that the quantum mechanics may be considered
to be a statistical description of randomly moving particles. We underline that we
investigate well known quantum systems, and all new results are corollaries of the
more developed methods of investigation.

The dynamic system

SS is determined completely by dynamic equations (1.2)
and expressions (1.3), (1.4) for the 4-current and the energy-momentum tensor.
Only connection between the particle and the wave function is not described by
these relations. This connection is described by means of the relations

conditions. They demand that the dynamic equations be linear and the wave func-
tion be a vector in the Hilbert space of states. We shall refer to the relations (2.1)
together with the restrictions imposed on its applications as the quantum principles,
because von Neumann has shown [12], that the quantum mechanics can be deduced
from relations of the type (2.1), provided they are valid for all observable quanti-
ties. Thus, the interpretation of the wave function is carried out on the basis of
the quantum principles, which are something external with respect to the dynamic
system

In reality, the quantum principles are not necessary for interpretation of the wave
SS. It is suﬃcient to make a proper
function and properties of the dynamic system
SS in terms of
change of dynamic variables and to describe the dynamic system
the particle coordinates x. Such a description does not contain the enigmatic wave

course, the trajectories x = x (t, ξ) do not describe the motion of individual stochas-

The situation reminds situation in the gas dynamics. The dynamic equations of
the gas dynamics describe the motion of the ”gas particles”, which contain many
molecules. Motion of the gas molecules is random and chaotic. It cannot be de-
scribed by the gas dynamics equations, which describe only regular component of
the molecule motion.

Note, that the term m

(2.11) it does not depend on the temporary derivative ˙x, and in dynamic equations
it acts as a potential energy.

On the contrary, the dynamic equations, generated by the action (1.1), are lin-
ear and rather simple, whereas their interpretation is very complicated, because it
uses the principles of quantum mechanics (2.1). Thus, the description by means
of the action (2.4) admits a simple interpretation, but dynamic equations are very
complicated for a solution.

If the action (1.1) is a special case of the action (2.4), it is reasonable to use
Sst] as starting point for the statement of the problem and
the dynamic system
[
for interpretation of the results obtained, whereas the dynamic system
SS will be
used only for solution of dynamic equations, which have a simple form in terms
of the wave function. Note, that according (A.36) the action (2.4) is transformed
to the action (1.7), containing two parameters: arbitrary dynamical constant b and
quantum constant ¯h. It is a natural form of the action, generating nonlinear dynamic

equation, if b

Why was the statistical ensemble

Sst] as a starting point was not not used
[
before? Why was the problem of the stochastic motion of microparticles stated
in terms of enigmatic wave function? The answer is very simple. The connection
between two diﬀerent forms (1.1) and (2.4) of the action for the Schr¨odinger particle
has not been known for a long time.

E

It is known, that the Schr¨odinger equation can be written in the hydrodynamical
form [14]. D. Bohm [15] used this circumstance for the hydrodynamic interpretation
of quantum mechanics. But it was only interpretation of the quantum principles in
the hydrodynamical terms. He failed to eliminate the quantum principles and the
wave function from the foundation of the quantum mechanics, and the wave function
remained to be an enigmatic object – the vector in the Hilbert space. One failed
to connect the wave function with the hydrodynamic variables: the density ρ and
the velocity v. In more exact terms the connection between the wave function and
hydrodynamic variables ρ, v was established, but it was a one-way connection. In the
case of the irrotational ﬂow the hydrodynamical variables can be expressed via the
wave function ψ, but one cannot do this in the case of the irrotational ﬂow. Hence,
one can transit from the description in terms of the wave function to the description
in terms of ρ, v, but one cannot transit from the hydrodynamic description in terms
of ρ, v to a description in terms of ψ, because, in general, the ﬂuid ﬂow is rotational,
and the dynamic system (2.4) cannot be described in terms of the one-component
wave function.

Let us present the wave function in the form

ψ = √ρeiϕ,

substitute it in the Schr¨odinger equation (1.2) and separate the real and imaginary
parts of the equation. We obtain two real equations

The hydrodynamic equations (2.17) are obtained as a result of diﬀerentiation of
the equation (1.2), written in terms of the wave function. It means that to transit
from the hydrodynamic equations (2.17) to the equation, written in terms of the
wave function, one needs to integrate the hydrodynamic equations (2.17). Besides,
in the case of the irrotational ﬂow the wave function is presented in terms of ρ and
hydrodynamical potential ϕ. The same is valid in the general case, but the number
of the hydrodynamical potentials is to be more than one, and it is necessary to
introduce additional hydrodynamic (Clebsch) potentials.

The problem of integration of the hydrodynamical equations is rather compli-
cated problem, which has been solved only in the end of eighties [16]. To solve this
problem, it was necessary to develop a special Jacobian technique [13], which was
used already by Clebsch [17, 18].

As soon as the hydrodynamic equations for the ideal ﬂuid have been integrated,
it becomes clear, that the wave function is simply a method of the ideal ﬂuid de-
scription. The wave function ψ ceases to be an enigmatic vector of the Hilbert space,
whose meaning was obtained only via quantum principles. Now one can determine
the chain of the dynamic variable transformations which turn the action (2.4) into
the action (2.2) (for details see Appendix A). As a result the action (2.4) may be
used as a starting point for the description of the quantum Schr¨odinger particle
SS.
At such a description the quantum principles (2.1) are not needed, because they are
only a tool for the interpretation of the wave function.

The statistical ensemble (2.4) as the starting point of the quantum description

has a series of advantages over the action (1.1):

1. The statistical ensemble (2.4) is a very transparent construction founded on
the simple physical idea, that the quantum particle is a stochastically moving
particle.

2. It does not use quantum principles, which are nonrelativistic and cannot be

extended properly to the relativistical case.

3. Statistical ensemble (2.4) is a more general construction, because the action

(1.1) is a partial case of the action (2.4)

4. Description in terms of the dynamic system (2.4) is a statistical description.
As any statistical description it contains two objects: the individual stochas-
tic particle
. Respectively there
individual measurement (S-measurement)
are two kinds of measurements:
produced over the individual particle
Sst and the massive measurement (M-
measurement) produced over the statistical average particle

Sst and the statistical average particle

hSsti

hSsti

The complexity of dynamic equations (2.12) is the only defect of the statistical

description (2.4).

We underline that the transition from the action (2.4) as a starting point to the
action (1.1) is motivated mathematically. No additional physical arguments have

9

been used for the substantiation of the statistical ensemble (2.4) as a starting point
of the quantum description.

The statistical description, founded on the action (2.4) leads to the statement
that wave function describes a state of the statistical ensemble
Sst], but not a state
[
of a single quantum particle. Discussion of the question, what object is described by
the wave function, has a long history. Some researchers [19] believe, that the wave
function describes the state of a single quantum particle, whereas other ones [20, 21]
believe that the wave function describes the state of the statistical ensemble. There
is a long list of diﬀerent opinions about this question, but we do not present them,
because this problem is not a question of a belief. It can and must be solved on the
basis of the mathematical formalism.

E

The problem is set as follows. What dynamic system is described by the action
(1.1)? A single quantum particle, or a statistical ensemble of single particles? Let
us go to the limit ¯h
0. Then the action (1.1) will describe the classical dynamic

of a statistical ensemble of single particles.

The action (2.19) describes the statistical ensemble of free classical particles and,
hence, the wave function describes the statistical ensemble, but not a single particle.
The action (2.19) may not describe a single classical particle, because the dynamic
system (2.19) has inﬁnite number of the freedom degrees. As far as the description
(2.19) in terms of the wave function Ψb is a limit ¯h
0 of the description in terms of
the wave function ψ, the wave function ψ in (1.1) may not describe a single quantum
particle. Thus, the supposition that the wave function describes a state of a single
particle is incompatible with the quantum mechanics formalism.

(2.20)

→

≡

According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics the wave
function ψ describes the state of a single quantum particle, whereas the state of a
classical particle is described by its position x and its momentum p. It is supposed
that the wave function is a speciﬁc quantum quantity, which has no classical analog.
In accordance with this approach one may not go to the limit ¯h
0 in the action
→
(1.1), because the action vanishes, and the description degenerates.

The transformation (1.6) changes only the scale of the wave function phase
), and this change may be very slight. The wave function Ψb is the valid

ln(ψ/

wave function, which can be used, in particular, for calculation of average values by
means of the relation (2.1). This calculation may be produced for any value of the
constant b. At diﬀerent values of the parameter b the wave function Ψb may describe
SS , because the state of the dynamic system does not determine
the same state of
SS may be described by diﬀerent
the wave function uniquely, and the same state of
wave functions. From viewpoint of the statistical description (2.4) the wave function
is not uniquely deﬁned, because it is constructed of hydrodynamic potentials, i.e.
it is a result of integration of uniquely deﬁned velocity v. The parameter b in the
transformation (2.1) is a constant of integration.

We may set b = ¯h in the relations (2.19), (2.20) and obtain a description of

”classical particle ” in the form containing the quantum constant ¯h.

The same result may be obtained from (2.19), (2.20) by means of the transformation
inverse to the transformation (1.6). Formally the action (2.21) distinguishes from the
action (1.1) in the last term, which describes a lack of quantum eﬀects. The quantum
constant in two ﬁrst terms has no relation to quantum eﬀects. The dependence on
¯h is conditioned by a special choice of the arbitrary constant b.

[
both languages (classical and quantum) shuts the door before the Copenhagen inter-
pretation, where the wave function is supposed to describe a single particle. Thus,
there is neither reason nor excuse for application of the Copenhagen interpretation.
Mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics deals with continuous dynamic
SD, etc. From the viewpoint of the
systems: Schr¨odinger particle
mathematical technique it is of no importance, whether
SS is an individual parti-
cle, or it is a statistical ensemble of particles (statistically average particle). The
Copenhagen interpretation meets the diﬃculties, when it tries to test predictions
of mathematical formalism in single experiments. For instance, there exists the
problem of the mechanism of the wave function reduction in the single experiment.
Another problem concerns the two-slit experiment. How can an individual parti-
cle pass through two slits at once? Such problems of quantum interpretations are
not wiredrawn. The physical journals publish discussions concerning problems of
quantum interpretation. For instance, such a discussion was declared in 2002 by
the journal Uspekhi Fizicheskich Nauk. These problems cannot be solved in the
framework of the Copenhagen interpretation, which does not distinguish between
the individual particle
. Confusion of two
diﬀerent objects, having diﬀerent properties generates diﬃculties and paradoxes.
, and it is
The wave function does not describe the state of individual particle
meaningless to ask, how the state of individual particle changes at a single measure-
ment (S-measurement). At the massive experiment (M-measurement) we obtain a
distribution F (R′) of the measured quantity
of the
measured quantity. At such a situation it is useless to ask, how the obtained result
R′ inﬂuences on the the state of the statistical ensemble. Finally, we may deﬁne
the third type of measurement (SM-measurement): the massive measurement of the
leading to a deﬁnite value R′ of the measured quantity
. The SM-
quantity
measurement is the M-measurement leading to a distribution F (R′), accompanied
by a selection of those particles, where result of S-measurement is R′. Uniting all
particles with the measured value R′ in one statistical ensemble
ER′, we can put the
question about the wave function of
ER′
does not coincide, in general, with the initial wave function ψ, and this change of the
wave function is considered as a reduction of the wave function. The origin of the
reduction is quite transparent. It is the selection, which is produced to obtain the
same value R′ of the measured quantity for all particles of the statistical ensemble.
Thus, the problems of reduction are conditioned by the confusion of concepts of the

As concerns the particle, passing through two slits simultaneously, it is a rea-
sonable property of the statistical average object. It is a pure statistical property,
which has nothing to do with quantum properties. Individual particle can pass ei-
ther through one slit, or through another, whereas the statistical average particle can
pass through both slits simultaneously. (Compare, individual person is either a man,
or a woman, whereas the statistical average person is a hermaphrodite (half-man

12

half-woman), and there are no quantum mechanical properties here.)

3 Dynamic disquantization

The quantum langauge, i.e. the description, containing the quantum constant ¯h,
may be used for a description of a classical dynamic system, because the quantum
constant ¯h may be used instead of the arbitrary dynamical constant b. Replacement
of dynamical constant b by the quantum constant is produced to make the dynamic
equations to be linear. For instance, in the action (1.7) the quantum constant ¯h
in the sense that setting ¯h = 0, we suppress the quantum
is used naturally, i.e.
eﬀects. In the action (1.1) for the same dynamic system the quantum constant ¯h
is used artiﬁcially in the sense that setting ¯h = 0, we do not suppress the quantum
eﬀects. Furthermore, setting ¯h = 0, we destroy any description. But the action
(1.1) generates linear dynamic equation, and this circumstance is a reason for the
artiﬁcial identiﬁcation b = ¯h, when the dynamical constant b is identiﬁed with the
quantum constant ¯h.

SD and

Such an artiﬁcial identiﬁcation may be produced in other quantum systems (for
SP), and we cannot be sure, that setting ¯h = 0, we suppress the
instance, in
quantum eﬀects. Besides, we cannot be sure that, using the transformation of the
type (1.6), we can separate the quantum terms from dynamical and statistical ones.
We need a more eﬀective formal dynamical procedure, which could suppress the

stochastic terms. Let us compare dynamic equations (2.12) for

where x = x (t, ξ), p = p (t, ξ). Dynamic equations (3.1), are the partial diﬀerential

respect to ξα, α = 1, 2, 3, whereas dynamic equations (3.2) are ordinary diﬀerential
equations. Equations (3.2) contain derivatives only in one direction in the space of

Usually the classical particle (for instance, the classical Schr¨odinger particle)
has two properties: (1) it does not contain the quantum constant ¯h, (2) it has the

13

ﬁnite number of the freedom degrees. We may imagine such a dynamic system,
which contains the quantum constant ¯h and has deﬁnite number of the freedom de-
grees. Is such a dynamic system classical? We believe that such a dynamic system
should be classiﬁed as classical, because it is deterministic dynamical system, but
not a stochastic one. As concerns to dependence on the quantum constant ¯h, it
may describe, in general, not only stochastic eﬀects. The quantum constant ¯h is
an attribute of the space-time [10], and in principle it may appear as a parameter
in deterministic classical systems, but not only in the stochastic ones. Besides, the
Sf with ﬁnite number of the freedom degrees is simpler for investiga-
dynamic system
tion, than the continuous dynamic system
Sc, having inﬁnite number of the freedom
Sf are the ordinary diﬀerential equations,
degrees, because dynamic equations of
Sc are partial diﬀerential equations. Transition to
whereas dynamic equations of
the classical approximation as a means of investigation of the quantum dynamic
system, which is continuous, is justiﬁed only if the classical system is the dynamic
system

If we want to suppress the quantum eﬀects, we must to reduce the system of
partial diﬀerential equations to the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. To
make this, we should project derivatives in the space of independent variables onto
some direction. Then the system will contain derivatives only in one direction, and
hence it may be reduced to the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Onto what
direction should derivatives in the system (3.1) be projected, to obtain the system
(3.2)?

Such a direction is described by the 4-current jk =

, k = 0, 1, 2, 3 in
the space-time. The projection should be made in the space of independent variables
t, x
, i.e. in the space-time. It is convenient to choose dependent variables in such
{

a way, that the 4-current jk were one of dependent variables. We take the action

Strictly, the dynamical disquantization is to be applied to the dynamic equations.
But in many cases the application of the dynamical disquantization to the action
leads to the same result, as its application to the dynamic equations.

4 Classical approximation of the Dirac particle

For transition to the classical approximation it is suﬃcient to make dynamical dis-
quantization of the Dirac equation (1.13). Using expression (1.14) for 4-current jk,
we make this directly in (1.13). We obtain

where jk is determined by the relation (1.14) via the wave function ψ.

Formally equations (4.2) form a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations for the
dependent variables ψ, considered as function of independent variable τ . Unfortu-
nately, interpretation of equations (4.2) is diﬃcult. It is more convenient to use the
hydrodinamical variables, where the the components of the 4-current jk are depen-
dent variables. The transformation to the hydrodynamical variables may be easier
carried out in the action (1.11).

Transforming the action (1.11), we use the mathematical technique [23, 24],
where the wave function ψ is considered to be a function of hypercomplex numbers
γ and coordinates x. In this case the physical quantities are obtained by means of
a convolution of expressions ψ∗Oψ with the zero divisor. This technique allows one
to work without ﬁxing the γ-matrices representation.

The quantities f k and zk are constant 4-vectors. They have the form (4.23) and
(4.24) only in some coordinate system. In other coordinate systems their form is
obtained as a result of corresponding transformation of relations (4.23) and (4.24).
These 4-vectors describe some structures, existing in the space-time. The vector zk
describes introduction of the projector (4.7). The 4-vector zk appears to be ﬁctitious
(see [2]).

However, the 4-vector f k is not ﬁctitious. It describes existence of some special
direction in the space-time. This direction describes separation of the space-time
into absolute time and absolute space. Having the vector f k, one can assign absolute
time t = xkfk and absolute spatial distance r =
xkxk to any space-time
vector xk. It means that the terms, containing the constant 4-vector f k are non-
relativistic. This statement is in accordance with the theorem, proved by Anderson
[26]. According to this theorem the symmetry group of dynamic equations, writ-
ten in the relativistically covariant form is determined by the symmetry group of
absolute objects. The absolute objects are the quantities, which are the same for
all solutions of the dynamic equations. The absolute objects are structures or force
ﬁelds external with respect to considered dynamic system.
In the given case the
4-vector f k is such an absolute object. If we set (4.23) in (4.21), we return to the
action (4.18), which does not contain the absolute object f k, but simultaneously the

action (4.18) appears to be written in the noncovariant form. In other words, the
relativistically covariant form of description is a method of separation of absolute
objects (or space-time structures) used at the description of the dynamic system.

Two ﬁrst terms in the action (4.21) do not contain the 4-vector f k. They describe
relativistically the motion of the classical Dirac particle as a whole. Two last terms
contain the 4-vector f k and the 4-pseudovector ξk. They describe internal degrees
of freedom of the classical Dirac particle. The description of the internal degrees of
freedom is nonrelativistic.

Dynamical methods of investigation and the formalized procedure of transition to
the classical approximation (3.5) admit one to discover two unexpected properties
of the Dirac particle: (1) the Dirac particle has an internal degrees of freedom,
(2) these degrees of freedom are described nonrelativistically. The last property
means that formally the Dirac equation is nonrelativistic equation, i.e. the set of all
solutions of the Dirac equation is not invariant with respect to the Lorentz group of
transformations.

In the case, when the electromagnetic ﬁeld is absent Ak = 0, dynamic equations,

generated by the action (4.20) have the form (see details in [2])

discover internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle by conventional methods?
Can one discover the nonrelativistical character of the Dirac equation by conven-
tional methods? If yes, then why have not these properties of the Dirac particle
been discovered for eighty years? In other words, we want to compare eﬀectiveness
of dynamical methods and axiomatic ones. There was a reason for the statement of
such questions.

5 On mistakes in application of the conventional
investigation method to the Dirac particle

At ﬁrst, the unexpected properties of the Dirac particle were presented in the paper
[27]. Unfortunately, I failed to publish this paper in a physical journal, because of
negative review of referees. Statements of the paper on internal degrees of freedom
and especially on a nonrelativistic character of the Dirac equation met objections
of the referees. These objections were of such a kind: (1) ’It is well known that
the Dirac equation is relativistic’, (2) ’Maybe, the author’s calculations contain a
mistake, because the Dirac equation agrees very well with the experiments’, (3) ’I
cannot imagine, that the Dirac equation is nonrelativistic, because it can be written
in the relativistically covariant form’. Discussion and evaluation of the merits of the
paper was absent in all reviews. The viewpoint of referees reﬂects the statistical
average opinion of the scientiﬁc community, and it should be taken into account.
The paper was rejected despite my comments to the reviews of the referees.

Then I decided that two new unexpected results were too many for one paper

freedom were discussed, whereas the paper [25] was devoted to discussion of the
nonrelativistic character of the Dirac equation. Again the referees have not found
mistakes or defects in my papers, but they recommended against publication of the
papers.

If the referees do not want or cannot ﬁnd mistakes in my papers, I have to search
for mistakes in the conventional axiomatic method, which lead to the absence of
internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle and to the relativistic character of
the Dirac equation. The corresponding mistakes have been easily found. Discovery
and discussion of these mistakes is presented below.

First about internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle. Conventionally
the Pauli equation is considered to be a nonrelativistic approximation of the Dirac
equation. The Pauli equation is a system of two ﬁrst order complex diﬀerential
equations for two complex dependent variables, whereas the Dirac equation is a
system of four ﬁrst order complex diﬀerential equations for four complex dependent
variables. It means that in the classical approximation the classical Pauli particle

the order of the Dirac system reduced indeed at the transition to the nonrelativistic
approximation?

Why is the order of the system of dynamic equations reduced at the nonrelativis-
tic approximation? It is reduced because coeﬃcients before some time derivatives
are of the order c−2, which vanish at c
. In other words, the Dirac system of
→ ∞
dynamic equations is a system of diﬀerential equations with small parameter before
the highest derivative. One may not neglect these terms, because at high temporal
frequency they may be of the same order as other terms, even if coeﬃcients before
the derivatives are small. Neglecting the terms with highest derivatives, we loss
the high frequency solutions of dynamic equations. From formal viewpoint such a
neglect of the terms with highest derivatives is a mathematical mistake, leading to
a loss of the high frequency solutions.

The scrupulous analysis shows [28] that solution of the Dirac equation in the

nonrelativistic approximation has the form

when γ is close to 1, the frequency Ω coincides with the frequency Ω, which ﬁgures
in relations (4.30), describing world line of the classical Dirac particle
SDcl. If we
ignore high frequency part of solution, setting u− = 0 in relations (5.1) - (5.3), we
obtain a solution of the Pauli equation. As far as the Dirac particle is a charged
particle, the states, where u+ 6
= 0, are unstable, because at such a state the
4-current jk has components, oscillating with the frequency Ω. The Dirac particle
emanates electromagnetic waves of the frequency Ω, until one of quantities u+ or
u− becomes to be equal to zero [28]. As far as the time of transition to the stable

Thus, the Dirac particle

state is very short, the Dirac particle exists practically either at the low frequency
state ψlf, when u− = 0, or at the high frequency state ψhf , when u+ = 0. The
state ψlf is associated with the particle, whereas the state ψhf is associated with the
antiparticle. Formally the superposition of the states ψlf and ψhf is possible, but it is
not realized for the charged Dirac particle because of its instability. This conclusion
SDcl, described by the
on the instability is valid also for the classical Dirac particle
relations (4.30), (4.31).
SD, described by the action (1.11), has internal degrees
of freedom, which has not been discovered because of a mathematical mistake in the
transition to the nonrelativistic approximation, which carries out an interpretation
of the Dirac particle. The internal degrees of freedom are not displayed in the
nonrelativistic applications of the Dirac equation, and there was no necessity of
looking for them. The transition to classical approximation must discover all degrees
of freedom automatically, but only in the case, when the procedure of transition
to the classical approximation is formalized. Conventionally the transition to the

such a way to obtain the desirable result known in advance. First the procedure
of transition to the classical approximation was formalized in [27], and the internal
degrees of freedom of

is common practice to think, that it means that the Dirac equation a relativistic
equation. In other words, it and has the Lorentz symmetry, i.e. the set of all its
solutions is transformed to the same set of solutions at any Lorentz transformation.
This opinion has been existing for many years, and we try to understand the reason
of this viewpoint.

Formally the relativistic character of dynamic equations associates with the rep-
resentation of these equations in the relativistically covariant form. However, this
association is valid only at some additional conditions, which are fulﬁlled practically
always, and as a result these conditions are not mentioned usually in the conventional
formulation of the relativistic invariance (i.e. compatibility of dynamic equations
with the principles of relativity). Unfortunately, in the case of the Dirac equation
these additional conditions are not fulﬁlled, and the Dirac equation appears to be
formally nonrelativistic. In reality, only internal degrees of freedom are nonrelativis-
tic. If these internal degrees of freedom are ignored, the Dirac particle appears to
be relativistic.

The additional constraint in the formulation of the relativistical invariance changes
the formulation. The correct formulation looks as follows. Symmetry of dynamic
equations, written in the relativistically covariant form coincides with the symmetry
of their absolute objects [26]. The absolute objects are such quantities, which are
the same for all solutions. Formally absolute objects are some structures or objects,
which are external with respect to considered dynamic system. Usually such an
absolute object is the metric tensor, which has the form gik =diag
.
}
The group of symmetry of gik is the Lorentz group, and the symmetry group of

dynamic equations appears to be the Lorentz group. The Maxwell equations, the
Klein-Gordon equation and many other dynamic equations for real dynamic sys-
tems contain only the metric tensor as an absolute object, and the formulation of
relativistical invariance is simpliﬁed. It looks as follows. The Lorentz group is the
symmetry group of dynamic equations, written in the relativistically covariant form.
In such a form it used by most researchers.

The Dirac equation does not contain the metric tensor. Instead it contains the
γ-matrices γi, i = 0, 1, 2, 3. The γ-matrices form a matrix 4-vector, whose symmetry
group is lower, than the Lorentz group. As a result the Dirac equation appears to
have not a symmetry of the Lorentz group.
In other words, the Dirac equation
appears to be nonrelativistic equation.

What physical situation is behind this result? Why does the dynamic equation,
if it
written in the relativistically covariant form, become to be nonrelativistic,
contains an absolute vector? To answer this question, we consider an example of a
charged classical particle, moving in the given electromagnetic ﬁeld F ik.

As far as dynamic equations for both relativistic and nonrelativistic particles
can be written in the noncovariant form and in the relativistically covariant one,
it is clear that the diﬀerence between the relativistic and nonrelativistic dynamic
equations is not connected with form of dynamic equations. There is anything else,
which distinguishes the relativistic conception from the nonrelativistic one.

r2. The Newtonian space-time

It is well known that the diﬀerence lies in diﬀerent space-time conceptions. In the
Newtonian conception there is an absolute simultaneity and there are two invariant
quantities: absolute time t and absolute space distance r, whereas in the relativistic
space-time conception there exists only one absolute quantity: the space-time inter-

objects (additional structures) are introduced. Thus, to determine, whether the dy-
namic equations are compatible with the principles of relativity, we may write them
in the relativistically covariant form and determine whether or not they contain
absolute objects and what are properties of these absolute objects. If the dynamic
equations contain the constant timelike vector lk, we have nonrelativistic dynamic
system, because lk describes the additional space-time structure, characteristic for
the Newtonian space-time

Such an approach is convenient in the sense, that it does not contain a refer-
ence to the coordinate system, which is simply a method of description. Relativis-
tic character of dynamic equation is connected directly with absence of additional
space-time structures in
SM, but not with the relativistically covariant form of the
dynamic equations, because any dynamic equations can be always written in the
relativistically covariant form, provided the proper geometrical structure is intro-

necessary only for a discovery of additional geometrical structures in the Minkowski
SM. Additional geometeric structures are primary, whereas the relativis-
space-time
tic covariance is secondary, because it admits one only to discover these structures
if they takes place. The relativistic covariance in itself is indiﬀerent with respect
to the relativistic invariance of the dynamic equations. The additional structure
is formally present in the equations (5.9) and described by the formal parameters
lk. When we use substitution lk =

in (5.9), we obtain (5.8), where the

Thus, the relativistic invariance of the dynamic equations is connected with

The relativistically covariant dynamic equation is relativistic, provided it does
not contain a reference to some additional structure. However, such a formulation
is unreliable, because the reservation of a reference to additional structure may be
omitted by mistake.
In this case the relativistic character of dynamic equations
appears to be connected with the relativistic covariance of these equations, but not
with the additional structure

a result we have an associative mistake, when the relativistic invariance is associ-
ated with the relativistic covariance, although in reality the relativistic invariance is

Thus, the internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle has not been dis-
covered theoretically, because they cannot be obtained experimentally. All precise
experiments with such a Dirac particle as electron are nonrelativistic (correction to
the spectrum of hydrogen) and internal rigid degrees of freedom give only a negligible
correction. As far as the internal degrees of freedom remained unknown, one cannot
obtain experimentally nonrelativistic character of their description. Unfortunately,
the quantum principles do not work in the relativistic region, and the conventional
quantum theory cannot obtain those results, which has not been obtained experi-
mentally, because it needs additional hypotheses, having experimental basis. The
dynamical methods are free of this defect. They work independently of experimental
data and additional hypotheses.

SM can be discovered.

(A.18)

The wave function is constructed of potentials. The equations (A.17) does not
contain potentials ξ and Ak, and they cannot be used for description of the ﬂuid
in terms of the wave function. To construct a description in terms of the wave
function, we should not to eliminate potentials ξ from the equations (A.11). Instead,
we should integrate them. The dynamic equations (A.11) may be considered to be
linear partial diﬀerential equations with respect to variables pk. They can be solved
in the form

pk = b (∂kϕ + gα (ξ) ∂kξα) ,

k = 0, 1, 2, 3

(A.19)

where gα (ξ) , α = 1, 2, 3 are arbitrary functions of the argument ξ =
, b
is an arbitrary real constant, and ϕ is the variable ξ0, which ceases to be ﬁctitious.
One can test by the direct substitution that the relation (A.19) is the general
solution of linear equations (A.11). Indeed, using (A.12) and the second identity
(A.13), the equations (A.11) may be written in the form

(A.22)

Here quantities pk are determined by the relations (A.19).

The action in the form (A.22) is remarkable in the sense, that it contains in-
formation on initial values of the ﬂuid velocities v = j/ρ. Dynamic equations,
generated by the action (A.22), are partial diﬀerential equations, and one needs to
give initial values for variables ϕ, ξ. But initial values for variables ϕ, ξ determine

28

only labelling of the ﬂuid particles, and they may be chosen universal. For instance,
we may choose for all ﬂuid ﬂows

ϕ (0, x) = ϕin (x) = 0,

ξ (0, x) = ξin (x) = x

(A.23)

Then the functions g (ξ) are determined by the initial values of the velocity v (0, x) =
vin (x) in the form [13]

g (ξ) = vin (ξ)

(A.24)

The initial value ρ (0, x) = ρin (x) of the density ρ may be also included in the action
(A.22). It is necessary only to redeﬁne the connection between the quantities jk and
ξ, substituting the relations (A.8) by the relations [13]

jk = ρ0 (ξ)

where ρ0 (ξ) is an arbitrary function of ξ. At the initial conditions (A.24) this
arbitrary function is to be chosen in the form

ρ0 (x) = ρin (x) = ρ (0, x)

Now we eliminate the variables j =

j1, j2, j3

from the action (A.22), using

relation (A.15). We obtain

In general, n depends on the form of the arbitrary integration functions g =

β = 1, 2, 3. The functions g determine vorticity of the ﬂuid ﬂow. If g = 0, equations

In the case of irrotational ﬂow, when the two-component function ψ has linear
, the 3-vector s =const, and the
dependent components, for instance ψ =
term containing 3-vector s vanishes. In the special case, when the electromagnetic
potentials Ak = 0, the action (A.36) for
Sst] coincides with the action (1.7) for
[
SS.
Finally, if we choose the arbitrary constant b in the form b = ¯h and set Ak = 0,
we obtain the action (1.1) for the Schr¨odinger particle.

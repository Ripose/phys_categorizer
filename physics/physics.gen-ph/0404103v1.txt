Abstract

Euler’s interpretation of Newton’s gravity (NG)
as Archimedes’ thrust in a ﬂuid ether is pre-
sented in some detail. Then a semi-heuristic
mechanism for gravity, close to Euler’s, is re-
called and compared with the latter. None of
these two “gravitational ethers” can obey clas-
sical mechanics. This is logical since the ether
deﬁnes the very reference frame, in which me-
chanics is deﬁned. This concept is used to build
a scalar theory of gravity: NG corresponds to an
incompressible ether, a compressible ether leads
to gravitational waves. In the Lorentz-Poincar´e
version, special relativity is compatible with the
ether, but, with the heterogeneous ether of grav-
it applies only locally. A correspondence
ity,
between metrical eﬀects of uniform motion and
gravitation is assumed, yet in two possible ver-
sions (one is new). Dynamics is based on a (non-
trivial) extension of Newton’s second law. The
observational status for the theory with the older
version of the correspondence is summarized.

1 Introduction

We now believe that Science can at best
tell how things happen, not why. This is to
say that phenomenologically eﬃcient theo-
ries are preferred over theories that claim
to have a “real explanation” for physical
phenomenons, but which are unable to give
a quantitative account of experiments.
I
share this common opinion, of course. There
cannot be any ﬁnal explanation for any class
of physical
facts, simply because physical
facts are precisely deﬁned only inside some
theoretical framework. Physics just builds
theoretical models, each for some domain of
physical reality, and which merely provide an
approximate description of how things are
going on. The better models are those that
apply to larger domains of physical reality,
and the ones that more closely approximate
observations.
(These are two conﬂicting
constraints.)

Thus, Newton’s theory of gravitation was
obviously a phenomenological theory: using
his mechanics, he derived it from Kepler’s
laws—themselves a kind of (very admirable)
ﬁtting of Tycho Brahe’s precise observations.

1

Moreover, Newton did not assume that the
attraction at a distance, which he was postu-
lating in his theory, did exist as such in the
physical world:

“[I] use the words attraction,

impulse, or
propensity of any sort towards a centre, promis-
cuously, and indiﬀerently: one for another; con-
sidering those forces not physically, but mathe-
matically: wherefore the reader is not to imag-
ine that by those words I anywhere take upon
me to deﬁne the kind, or the manner of any ac-
tion, the causes or the physical reason thereof,
or that I attribute forces, in a true and physical
sense, to certain centres, (which are only math-
ematical points); when at any time I happen to
speak of centres as attracting, or as endued with
attractive powers.” [1]

In fact, he considered that his phenomeno-
logical attraction force might possibly result
from the pressure of an “aether” (I did read
some careful sentence by him in this sense,
but could not ﬁnd it again), though he did
not develop this idea. 1

But Euler did imagine a deﬁnite mecha-
nism for gravity and did describe it at length
[4, 5], although that work of Euler is not well-
known. Now the aim of the present paper is
to discuss in more detail the tentative mecha-

1 It is relevant to note that Newton was a close
friend of Fatio de Duillier, the ﬁrst proponent [2] of
what became known as Le Sage’s theory and that
is now experiencing a revival of interest under the
name “pushing gravity theory” [3]. According to this
concept, gravity would be due to the massive bodies
shielding an ubiquitous ﬂux of “ultramondane parti-
cles”. As far as I know, an accurate model of gravity
based on Fatio–Le Sage’s concept is still lacking.

nism for gravity, on which is based a formerly
developed theory of gravity [6]–[9]—and also,
to somewhat extend that theory. Since that
mechanism turns out to be quite close to that
imagined by Euler (although I was not aware
of that for my ﬁrst work on this theory [6, 7]),
I shall ﬁrst review his relevant work in some
detail (Sect. 2). In Sect. 3, I shall present
my own version of a heuristic mechanism for
gravity and compare it with Euler’s concept.
Section 4 will discuss the idea of a correspon-
dence between metrical eﬀects of motion and
gravitation, as well as the two possibilities
arising therefrom as regards the space-time
metric. The possible forms of the scalar ﬁeld
equation shall be discussed in Sect. 5. Then
the dynamics of the theory will be summa-
rized (Sect. 6). The current state of the ex-
perimental test shall be reviewed in Sect. 7.

2 Euler’s

interpretation

of Newton’s theory

In a ﬁrst paper [4], Euler admitted that the
“least parts of matter” or “molecules” have all
the same density—so that the diﬀerent den-
sities of material bodies are due to the fact
that the bodies are dominantly composed of
“pores”— and that these “molecules” are sur-
rounded by “an extremely subtle matter which,
by its motion, is endowed with a force capable of
pushing the bodies downwards and of producing
all phenomenons of gravity.” (My translation.)
The “motion” referred to must actually be
thought of as closely related to the pressure
exerted by the “subtle matter”:

2

“Now, in whatever way we imagine the cause
of gravity, as it is the eﬀect of the pressure of
a ﬂuid, the force with which each molecule is
pushed will always be proportional to the exten-
sion or the volume of that molecule. Indeed it
is a general rule of hydrostatics that ﬂuids act
according to the volumes: a body immersed in
water is always pushed by a force equal to the
weight of an equal volume of water, but in an
opposite direction.”

Thus, in eﬀect he a priori admitted that
gravity is due to Archimedes’ thrust exerted
by a “subtle ﬂuid”, and, in order that this
force reduce to a mass force, as does gravity,
he had to admit also that the ﬁnest compo-
nents of any matter all have the same density.
The main part of the usual, weighty bodies
had then to be made of “pores”, which had
to be occupied by the assumed ﬂuid, and Eu-
ler asked whether that ﬂuid which, “however
subtle it be, will yet be material”, was of the
same kind as the weighty matter. But if that
would be the case,

“the whole space would be ﬁlled with a mat-
ter everywhere equally dense, and even denser as
gold; which would make very diﬃcult, not to say
impossible, the explanation of motion. Indeed,
although there is only a small part among the
bodies which are weighty bodies and which can
be perceived by phenomenons, the other part,
owing to its very large density, could but resist
to motion; now we do hardly notice any resis-
tance by which the motion of bodies be dimin-
ished, as soon as we have removed the resistance
of weighty bodies, like the air.”

For that reason, he sustained that
“the matter which constitutes the subtle
is of an utterly

ﬂuid, cause of the gravity,

diﬀerent nature from the matter, of which all
sensible bodies are composed. There will hence
be two kinds of matter, one which provides the
stuﬀ to all sensible bodies, and of which all
particles have the same [high] density [...]; the
other kind of matter will be that of which the
subtle ﬂuid, which causes gravity, and which
It is probable
we name ether, is composed of.
that this matter has always the same degree of
density, but that this degree is incomparably
smaller than that of the ﬁrst kind.”

In the second paper [5], Euler explained in
more detail the mechanism by which the pres-
sure of the ether or subtle ﬂuid would cause
gravity:

“Those who attribute gravity to an attractive
force of the Earth base their opinion mainly on
the fact that otherwise no origin could be dis-
played for this force. But since we proved that all
bodies are surrounded with ether and are pressed
by the elastic force of the latter, we do not need
to search elsewhere the origin of gravity. Only
if the pressure of the ether would be everywhere
the same, which assignment is indistinguishable
from that of its equilibrium, would the bodies be
equally pressed from every side, and thus would
not be induced in any motion. But if we assume
that the ether around the Earth is not in equi-
librium, and that instead its pressure becomes
smaller as one comes closer to the Earth, then
any given body must experience a stronger pres-
sure downwards on its superior surface that it
does upwards on its inferior surface; it follows
that the downwards pressure will have the ad-
vantage and hence that the body will really be
pushed downwards, which eﬀect we call gravity,
and the downwards-pushing force the weight of

3

the body.” (My translation.)

ticles”, 2 hence we have from (2):

Thus, gravity would indeed be Archimedes’
thrust due to the gradient of the ether pres-
sure, which would act on the “basic particles”
(“grobe Theilchen”) [those that “provide the
stuﬀ to all sensible bodies”, see the paragraph
before]. This force depends only on the vol-
ume. More precisely, Euler assumed that, for
a point being at a distance x from the center
of the Earth, the pressure is

where h is “the height, by which we let the pres-
sure of the ether be expressed, when it is at rest”
[i.e., in equilibrium]. He deduced therefrom
that the weight of a body is

pe = h

A
x

,

−

P =

A
x2 c3,

with c3 its “true volume” (“wahre Gr¨osse”),
i.e., the sum of the volumes of the “basic par-
ticles” in it. Thus, he “deduced” Newton’s
inverse square law from a linear spatial vari-
ation of the pressure—or rather the oppo-
site way. He then noted that this expression
of the weight means that the corresponding
A
x is very large: he expressed
pressure “loss”
the pressure by the height of a column of wa-
ter (thus 32 feet for the “elastic force of the
air”, i.e., the atmospheric pressure), and he
expressed the weight by that of a volume of
water on the Earth’s surface. In such units,
the weight on the Earth’s surface is c3ρp with
ρp the common mass density of the “basic par-

−

ρp =

with r the Earth’s radius. Since ρp > 19
(the density of gold), he thus found that
A > 19r2. On the Earth’s surface, the
pressure “lost” (as compared with the pres-
sure of the ether in equilibrium at inﬁnity,
given by the height h) is hence, by (1),
r > 19r, which is indeed more than

107 atmospheres.

When there are several celestial bodies, as
is indeed the case in reality, Euler remarked
that the pressure losses caused by each of
them should add up, so that the pressure is

instead of (1), where z, y, x, v, etc., are
the distances to the respective centres of the
celestial bodies. This, of course, is equiva-
lent to assuming that the weight (the grav-
itational force) is the sum of the attraction
forces caused by the diﬀerent bodies. Eu-
ler noted that A, B, etc., should have the
form A = mM1, B = mM2, etc., where M1,
M2, etc., are the masses of the bodies, and
the constant m may be calculated from (3)
(assuming one knows ρp, in fact he assumed
ρp = 40 for illustrative purpose). He con-
cluded:

own work, and for M1, M2 below, the notations in
this Section are those used by Euler himself.

“But although we must stay here and can
hardly hope to ever be able to elucidate the true
origin of the decrease in the elastic force of the
ether, one can yet more easily accept this, rather
than to barely admit that all bodies are endowed
by Nature with an ability to attract one another.
Indeed one cannot get the slightest beginning
of an understandable concept of this attraction,
whereas, on the contrary, one can to the very
least acknowledge it as possible that the elas-
tic force of a ﬂuid be diminished, and one con-
ceives also that this might happen by virtue of
some law of Nature. But all rests on the fol-
lowing two points: ﬁrstly, why is the pressure of
the ether decreased by the presence of the ba-
sic bodies which it contains? And secondly, why
does this decrease become larger and larger, as
one comes closer to the body? The reason for
this must thus apparently be in the basic mat-
ter [i.e. the union of the “basic particles”], of
which any body is made, and the basic matter
must cause a motion in the ether, by which the
equilibrium is raised. If one has ﬁrst got so far,
then it is easy to show that the pressure of the
ether should be reduced in proportion.”

3 A neo-Eulerian mecha-

nism for gravity

The starting point for this work was Ro-
mani’s concept of a perfectly-ﬂuid “constitu-
tive” ether, according to which the elemen-
tary constituents of matter should be noth-
ing else than organized ﬂows in the ether,
like vortices [10]. This concept allows one
to get a picture of the creation/ annihila-

tion/ transmutation of particles, and of the
numerous instable “resonances”, all observed
in particle physics—but, of course, it would
be very ambitious to attempt a reconstruc-
tion of particle physics along this line. Ro-
mani also considered that gravity is due to a
gradient in the ether density [10] (Vol. 1). He
stated that the ether density should increase
towards the Sun and cause a light deﬂection
in the way it occurs in an optical medium
with variable index, thus following Fermat’s
principle [10] (Vol. 2). This same idea has
been proposed by several other authors, e.g.
Podlaha & Sj¨odin [11]. However, as such it
does not provide any interpretation of New-
ton’s attraction, nor indeed any mechanism
for usual gravity. I tried to ﬁnd one.

3.1 Gravity

acceleration vs.

ether pressure

The successful attempt used the simplest con-
cept: only a perfect ﬂuid could ﬁll the space
without braking the motion of material bod-
ies, and only the pressure force can be ex-
erted by a such ﬂuid [6]. I had ﬁrst rejected
that concept due to its a priori shocking con-
sequence, namely the fact that the pressure
pe of the ether has to decrease towards the
attracting centre. The resultant of the pres-
sure forces on a small object ω is Archimedes’
thrust FA =
V (ω)gradpe, where V (ω) is the
volume of that object and gradpe is the lo-
cal value of the pressure gradient. In order
that this force depend in fact on the mass
of the object, one thus ﬁnds that the elemen-
tary particles, which make matter, and which

−

5

are the objects that are actually subjected to
gravity, must all have the same density ρp.
The value of the gravity acceleration is thus
[6]:

g =

gradpe
ρp

,

−

(5)

which turns out to be equivalent to Euler’s
assumption [4] if ρp is assumed constant (see
Sect. 2). At that point, however, I noted that
ρp may actually depend on the ether pressure
pe, but only on pe, and that it would seem
miraculous, unless the particles themselves
are made of ether; which I did assume, thus
staying with Romani’s constitutive ether, and
hence setting

g =

gradpe
ρe

,

−

(6)

where ρe = ρe(pe) is the “density” in the
ether, the latter being assumed a barotropic
ﬂuid. Hence, unless that ﬂuid is incompress-
ible, i.e. unless ρe = Const. (which is a spe-
cial, degenerate case of a barotropic ﬂuid),
Eqs. (5) and (6) are not equivalent.

3.2 The ether of gravity does
not obey classical mechan-
ics

The concept of the constitutive ether means
the
there would be nothing but
that
perfectly-ﬂuid ether, hence in that case there
should be no problem of braking. In fact it
seems that it would be also the case if the
perfectly-ﬂuid ether would only surround el-
ementary particles which would be made of a
diﬀerent stuﬀ (as assumed by Euler), and this

independently of the high or low density of
the ﬂuid: indeed a truly perfect ﬂuid does not
brake objects; this result is known in classical
ﬂuid mechanics as “d’Alembert’s paradox”,
although it is no paradox (Ref.
[12], Sect.
11). However, the ether assumed in either
mechanism is not in equilibrium. Let us ﬁrst
consider the space-ﬁlling constitutive ether
assumed by me, that includes the elemen-
tary particles of matter considered as ﬂows
in the ether. It is subjected only to the pres-
sure force, which is equivalent to the internal
gradpe per unit volume. Considering
force
now Euler’s ether, which is distinct from the
“basic particles”, the same is true, but the unit
volume is that of ether, not the total volume
(ether plus basic particles). Therefore, if the
ether were to obey classical ﬂuid mechanics,
it would have to be in a motion, with velocity
ue, obeying... Euler’s equation:

(7)
(with µ = 1 for the constitutive ether and

f for Euler’s ether, where f is the vol-
ume fraction of the “basic particles”), 3 plus
the “mass” conservation. In the case of Eu-
ler’s ether, the “mass” conservation is not im-
mediate to write at the macroscopic scale, for
we have then a two-phase medium. (It is the
macroscopic scale which is relevant here, be-
cause otherwise one has diﬀerent equations,
3 For Euler’s ether, the density ρe in Eq. (7) is the
“eﬀective” or macroscopic density, i.e. the “mass”,
or rather the amount of ether, divided by the total
volume: ρe = ˜ρe(1
f ) where ˜ρe is the true ether
density. Note that the state equation gives directly
˜ρe, not ρe, as function of the local pressure pe.

−

depending on which phase is involved, and
because gravitation is a macroscopic force:
see the following Subsection.) But let us ﬁrst
discuss the case with the constitutive ether.
The conservation of that ﬂuid should then be
written as the usual continuity equation:

∂T ρe + div(ρeue) = 0.

(8)

But the ether density ρe is directly related to
the gravity acceleration g by Eq.
(6), and
g must in fact be determined by the posi-
tions of the massive bodies. For instance, let
us demand that Newton’s gravity be exactly
valid (as Euler demanded). Then we intro-
duce the Newtonian potential U, governed by
Poisson’s equation:

∆U =

4πGρ,

(9)

−
with ρ the macroscopic density of matter and
G the gravitational constant. And, assuming
that macroscopic matter, like the ether, is in
the form of a barotropic perfect ﬂuid (for sim-
plicity), it has a velocity u, a pressure p, with
ρ = ρ(p), which ﬁelds obey also Eqs. (7) and
(8), though without the index e, and with the
gravitational force on the r.h.s. of the former,
that is
du
dT

∂T ρ+div(ρu) = 0.
(10)
Thus we have nine independent scalar un-
knowns, namely U, p, u, pe, ue. Now, since
g = gradU, (6) is equivalent to the scalar
equation

gradp+ρ gradU,

−

=

U =

G(pe) + ϕ(T ), G(pe)

dpe/ρe(pe).

−

≡ Z

But even then we have still ten independent
scalar equations, namely (7), (8), (9), (10),
and (11). We can get from (6) (or from (11))
and from (7) (with µ = 1):

due
dT

= gradU,

(12)

which means that the ether would have to
be in a free fall in the gravity acceleration
ﬁeld. Although the “mass” conservation is
more complicated to write (at the macro-
scopic scale) for Euler’s ether, it must also
add one equation. Hence, the overdeter-
mination is also true for Euler’s ether, for
which one uses Eq. (5) instead of (6), and
µ = 1
f in Eq. (7), with indeed f = ρ/ρp.
The overdetermination of the ﬁeld equations
means that usually they will have no solution.
I conclude that the ether, in which gravity is
Archimedes’ thrust, can hardly obey classical
mechanics.

3.3 The micro-ether and the

would have to answer the question: but how
are the inertial frames deﬁned, if the ether
has a general ﬂuid motion? It seems indeed
that the introduction of an ether should
enable us to deﬁne an inertial frame—thus
explaining the origin of the inertial frames,
which is a mysterious question in Newton’s
mechanics. Moreover, gravity is a macro-
scopic force,
in the sense that the gravity
acceleration vector of Newton’s gravity

(11)

is known to vary signiﬁcantly only over
macroscopic distances, due to the variation
of the position with respect to big, massive
bodies—in sharp contrast with the other
known forces (electromagnetic and nuclear
forces), which vary much more rapidly with
distance. (This does not contradict the fact
that gravitation is felt even by the ﬁnest
particles, of course.)

Therefore, the ether of gravity must be
the macroscopic ether or “macro-ether”, ob-
tained by averaging the microscopic ﬁelds
density ρ′

(velocity u′

e,
that characterize the assumed perfectly-ﬂuid
ether, which I call the “micro-ether”. In par-
ticular, we may deﬁne a reference frame E as
the one whose each point has as its velocity
the local value of the averaged velocity ﬁeld
u′
ue(T, x)
eiiT,x (the velocity ﬁeld of the
micro-ether, u′
e, being taken in any reference
frame, possibly a deformable or “ﬂuid” refer-
ence frame, see Ref. [6] for a detailed study of
that notion). Then, by deﬁnition of the frame
E, the average velocity ﬁeld ue is identically
zero in that very frame. It is that frame which
will deﬁne the equivalent of Newton’s abso-
lute space. Thus, because the macro-ether
deﬁnes the reference frame in which mechan-
ics is primarily deﬁned, the motion of that
reference frame itself does not obey mechan-
ics. And gravitation is assumed to result from
the macroscopic part of the pressure gradi-
ent in the micro-ether: the microscopic pres-
sure and velocity ﬁelds p′
e would then
have to account for microphysics, indeed—
but this is another story, which I do not try
to tell (one may tentatively assume that the

e and u′

microscopic motion of the ether with respect
to its mean rest frame E does obey mechan-
ics [6]). From the formal, axiomatic point of
view, the theory starts from the macro-ether
or preferred reference frame as a primary con-
cept, 4 and assumes that the gravity accelera-
tion is deﬁned by Eq. (6). The ﬁeld pe has to
obey some partial diﬀerential equation which
shall be chosen mainly by phenomenological
means, i.e., from the wish to account in a
mathematically simple way for what we know
about eﬀective gravity (or rather for what
we think we know). But since we start from
an equation for the gravity acceleration, we
shall have to deﬁne and use a dynamics based
on some extension of Newton’s second law of
motion, rather than on Einstein’s assumption
according to which “free test particles follow
space-time geodesics”.

3.4 A constraint on the equa-

tion for the ﬁeld pe

The most obvious constraint to be imposed
on the equation for the ﬁeld pe is that New-
ton’s gravity should be recovered in some
limit, the question is: in which limit? Since
we assume that gravitation results from the
macroscopic part of the pressure gradient in
the micro-ether, we expect that, if that ﬂuid
is (macroscopically) compressible, a distur-

(13)

On the other hand, we know that New-
ton’s gravitation propagates instantaneously.
Therefore, it should correspond to the limit-
ing case of an incompressible ﬂuid. The lat-
ter should be an excellent approximation in
many cases, because Newton’s gravity is ex-
tremely accurate in many situations (in par-
ticular in the solar system). Newton’s gravity
is characterized by Poisson’s equation for the
gravity acceleration g:

div g =

4πGρ.

(14)

−
Together with Eq. (6) for g, the requirement
that Eq. (14) is recovered in the incompress-
ible case, i.e., ρe = Const., leads immediately
to an equation for the ﬁeld pe:

∆pe = 4πGρρe,

(15)

which should thus apply in the limit of the
degenerate barotropic relationship ρe(pe) =
Const.

be-
tween metrical eﬀects
of motion and gravita-
tion: the bifurcation

Surely, nowadays a theory of gravitation
should account in some way for special rel-
ativity (SR), because SR has made a lot of

experimentally-conﬁrmed predictions, the set
of which is very hard to obtain without SR.
This is well-known. The minimum require-
ment for a theory of gravity to account for SR
is that SR should be exactly recovered when
gravity evanesces, i.e., in the limit G
0
[14].

4.1 Special relativity with an

ether

initiated

It is a historical curiosity that the theory
which we now name SR, on one hand has
been entirely derived,
in one version, by
physicists (mainly Lorentz and Poincar´e)
who did accept and explicitly used Lorentz’s
concept of the ether as a preferred inertial
frame in which Maxwell’s equations are
valid, and on the other hand,
in its best-
known version, is still currently believed to
have discarded that very concept!
Indeed
Einstein wrote in his celebrated paper [15],
which
the Einstein-Minkowski
version of SR, that “the introduction of a
‘luminiferous ether’ will appear superﬂuous”.

1) are written in
Poincar´e’s work 5 [17, 18].
(Both papers
are available online.)
It can also be easily
checked that Poincar´e, and Lorentz as well,
considered an ether in their papers that
founded the Lorentz-Poincar´e version of SR
[18, 19], and persisted until they died in 1912
before
and 1928 respectively—although,
1900, Poincar´e had been close to abandon
the ether; thus, he considered abandoning
the concept of an ether, but came back
to it precisely in the context of SR. His
reason may have been that, without an
ether, there is no preferred time any more,
so that simultaneity becomes inherently and
incurably a relative notion.

Since one version of SR has been derived
by persistent ether theorists of the stature
of Lorentz and Poincar´e, it is a priori obvi-
ous that SR should be fully compatible with
Lorentz’s concept of ether. That this is in-
deed the case, has been proved with a lux-
ury of details by Prokhovnik [20, 21], J´anossy
[22], Pierseaux [23], and Brandes [24]. The
main diﬀerence between the Lorentz-Poincar´e
and the Einstein-Minkowski versions of SR is
this: in the latter version, the eﬀects on dis-
tances and time intervals, associated with the
Lorentz transformation of space and time co-
ordinates, are seen as a mere eﬀect of perspec-
tive in space-time. Whereas, in the former
version, they are seen as true eﬀects which
result from a real contraction of physical ob-
jects that move through the fundamental in-

ertial frame (Lorentz’s ether). That contrac-
tion implies the slowing down of a moving
“light clock” (an interferometer’s arm). Since
the Michelson-Morley experiment means that
such light clocks do measure physical time,
it follows that the time ﬂows more slowly in
a moving frame. See Ref.
[20] for a rather
complete construction of SR along this line,
and cf. Ref.
[7] for an outline. Because,
in the Lorentz-Poincar´e version, SR follows
from this “true” Lorentz contraction which is
a dynamical eﬀect, SR does not necessarily
apply to the whole of physics. More exactly,
what is needed in that derivation of SR (as
well as in the derivation based on Einstein’s
two well-known assumptions) is that physi-
cal space and time are homogeneous, i.e., the
physical clocks and the measuring rods be-
have in the same way at any time and at any
place. Now, the interpretation (6) of gravity
as a gradient of pressure and density in the
universal ﬂuid naturally seems to imply that
gravitation makes physical space and time
heterogeneous. 6 Therefore, we expect that
SR and its exact Lorentz invariance should
be broken by the presence of a gravitational
ﬁeld. Precisely, the theory of gravity [6]–[9]
is a preferred-frame theory, and most of its
equations are valid only in an a priori pos-
tulated preferred reference frame or “macro-
ether” (see Subsect. 3.3 for the explanation of
that name). Now a bifurcation allowing some
extension of that theory will be recognized.

5 It is easier yet to check this in the commented

translation by Logunov [16].

6 Note that this is also the case in general rela-
tivity (GR), according to which SR holds true only
in inﬁnitesimal domains of space and time.

4.2 Two alternative assump-
tions about metrical eﬀects
of gravity

When combined with the Lorentz-Poincar´e
version of SR, the assumption of a hetero-
geneous gravitational ether leads naturally
to assume that a gravitational ﬁeld, i.e. a
heterogeneous ﬁeld of ether pressure pe and
density ρe = ρe(pe), does indeed modify the
behaviour of clocks and rods. To see this, let
us imagine that an observer, say Nancy, is
moving through a homogeneous ether, thus
in the absence of gravity. Her measuring
meters are Lorentz-contracted, parallel to
the direction of her velocity u with respect
to the ether, so that a given domain in
for her, a greater volume
the ether has,
δV ′ = γuδV , where δV is the volume of the
domain, when this domain is seen from the
ether frame, and where γu > 1 is the Lorentz
7 Therefore, Nancy would be led
factor.
to ﬁnd that the ether density is smaller for
her than for a ﬁxed observer, ρ′
e = ρe/γu.
Thus, the Lorentz contraction of her meters
and the Larmor dilation of the period of her
clock depend on precisely the ratio of the
ether density in the moving frame to that in
the ether frame.

7 This is true if one uses the “absolute” simul-
taneity, i.e., that obtained by Poincar´e-Einstein clock
synchronization in the ether frame; cf. Ref. [25]. As
indicated by the work of Mansouri & Sexl [26], and
as shown in detail by Selleri [27], a theory observa-
tionally very close to SR can be based on using just
that notion of simultaneity. This theory is yet diﬀer-
ent from the Lorentz-Poincar´e version of SR, which
is based on the usual Lorentz transformation.

It is hence natural to assume that, in a het-
erogeneous ether, thus with a gravitational
ﬁeld, the clocks will be slowed down and the
meters will be contracted, in precisely the ra-
tio of the local ether density ρe to the den-
sity ρ∞
in the region far enough from massive
e
bodies and thus free from gravitational ﬁeld,

e may be precisely deﬁned as ρ∞

(ρ∞
≡
Supx∈[space]ρe(x, T ), hence it generally de-
pends on the time T .) The very notion of
a clock slowing and a contraction of objects
implies that there must be a reference with
respect to which these eﬀects do occur, and
the simplest possibility is clearly to assume a
ﬂat reference metric. Thus, space-time is en-
dowed with two metrics: a ﬂat “background”
metric γ0 and a curved “physical” metric
γ. More precisely, I assume that there are
Galilean coordinates (xµ) for γ0 [i.e., in that
coordinates, (γ0
µν) = diag(1,
1)],
which are adapted to the preferred frame E.
(“Adapted coordinates” are such that any
particle bound to the given frame has con-
stant space coordinates.) The inertial time in
x0/c, is called the
the preferred frame, T
“absolute time”. Due to the assumed time-
dilation, the expression of the physical metric
in any coordinates (yµ) adapted to the frame
E, with y0 = x0 = cT , is:

But there are two possibilities as regards
the gravitational contraction: either we may
assume [7] that, in the same way as for the
case with a uniform motion, it occurs only
in one direction—which then can only be the
direction of the gravity acceleration g, i.e.,
that of the density and pressure gradients,
Eq. (6). In that case, the “physical” space
metric g is found [28] to have the following
relation to the Euclidean metric g0 (which is
the spatial part, in the frame E, of the ﬂat
space-time metric γ 0, as g is for metric γ):

considering that space must remain isotropic,
we may assume instead that the gravitational
rod contraction in the ratio β is the same in
all directions (as Podlaha & Sj¨odin [11] ap-
parently assumed). In that case, the relation
between the ﬂat and physical space metrics
in the frame E will be simply

g = β−2g0.

(19)

One may also imagine intermediate solu-
tions, of course, but these are the two extreme
and most natural possibilities. Until now, I
have considered only the ﬁrst (anisotropic)
possibility (18), for which the correspondence
between metrical eﬀects of motion and grav-
itation is the closest. But it turns out that

it leads to a disturbing violation of the weak
equivalence principle for an extended body
at the point particle limit [29, 30]. As I
show [29], this violation comes from the fact
that the “anisotropic” spatial metric (18), or
rather the post-Newtonian (PN) approxima-
tion to this metric, contains terms that de-
pend on the spatial derivatives of the New-
tonian potential U; hence, that part of the
PN acceleration which involves the spatial
Christoﬀel symbols contains second spatial
derivatives U,i,j of U—and the “self” part of
the U,i,j’s (i.e., the contribution to U,i,j that
comes from the body itself, whose the accel-
eration is being computed) does not evanesce
with the size of the body. For that reason,
I expect that the same violation should also
occur in GR, depending on the gauge [29, 31],
but it would be more diﬃcult to prove it,
due to the complexity of GR (which makes
it diﬃcult [32] to develop, for PN calcula-
tions, asymptotic schemes in the line of those
which are developed in applied mathematics).
Coming back to the scalar ether theory, if one
substitutes the “isotropic” spatial metric (19)
for the “anisotropic” metric (18), the PN ap-
proximation to (19) will involve U but not the
derivatives U,i, hence the violation should not
occur any more.

5 Possible forms of the
scalar ﬁeld equation

According to the correspondence postulated
in Subsect. 4.2, the metrical eﬀects of a gravi-
tational ﬁeld depend on the ratio β, Eq. (16).

12

Thus, the constraint that Newton’s gravity
should be recovered in the limit of an incom-
pressible ether, i.e. for ρe = ρ∞
e , means that
Eq. (15) has to be recovered for β = 1. In
the case with a compressibility, we expect, as
mentioned in Subsect. 3.4, that in general
there should be pressure waves propagating
with the velocity (13). Hence, the left-hand
side of the sought equation should then be a
kind of wave operator involving the (a pri-
ori variable) propagation velocity ce, instead
of the Laplace operator—which should be re-
covered in the case of a static ﬁeld, for which
the propagation does not play any role. But
the idea according to which material particles
are microscopic ﬂows in the ether implies that
this “sound” velocity should be a limit for
the motion of material particles, and since SR
sets the other limit c, one must have ce = c
everywhere and at every time, which means
that pe = c2ρe. It is, of course, when evalu-
ated with the physical metric that the speed
limit is c, hence the foregoing discussion ap-
plies to the equation for the scalar ﬁeld, in
in particular,
terms of the physical metric;
the Laplace operator is in terms of the phys-
ical, Riemannian space metric g. Thus, we
are led to postulate an equation of the form

∆gpe+(time derivatives of pe) = 4πGσρeF (β),

the time-derivative term being such that, in

Newtonian density ρ has been replaced by
some mass-energy density σ, deﬁned in terms
of the energy-momentum tensor T. This does
not ﬁx the equation, of course. Until now,

Newton’s 2nd law

Newton’s second law: force = time-derivative

It is more general

than Lagrangian/Hamiltonian formulations
(of which Einstein’s assumption of a mo-
tion along space-time geodesics turns out
to be a particular case).
It is indeed a
well-known fact in classical mechanics that
Lagrangian systems are quite particular
dynamical systems. Moreover, Newton’s
second law is based on a clear space/time
separation, which corresponds to our intu-
itive concepts of space and time—whereas
Einstein’s assumption gives a physical status
to space-time, and GR leads naturally to
the possibility of time travels [33], with their

13

well-known paradoxes. Newton’s second law
has an obvious phenomenological ﬂexibility,
since we may alter the expression of the
force. However, as regards the force of
it should be equal to mg with
gravity,
m the inertial mass and g the gravity
acceleration, in order to save (at least for a
test particle) the equality between inertial
mass and passive gravitational mass. The
latter equality, which is equivalent to the
weak equivalence principle, is an accurately-
established experimental fact, and is true for
the investigated interpretation of gravity as
Archimedes’ thrust, as long as we stay in
classical mechanics (see Subsect. 3.1). Now
we account for SR, consistently with this
interpretation, by saying that SR holds true
locally—because an object moving through
the macro-ether is Lorentz-contracted, as
compared with an identical object staying
at rest in the same place in the macro-ether
made heterogeneous by gravity. Therefore,
we must now take as the inertial mass the
velocity-dependent mass m(v)
m(0)γv,
where the velocity v of the test particle, and
its modulus v, are measured with clocks and
rods of the momentarily-coincident observer
bound to the macro-ether, thus with the
physical space-time metric. In the same way,
the gradient operator entering Eq. (6) for g
is now relative to the physical, curved space
metric. Thus, the left-hand side of Newton’s
second law, that is the gravitational force, is
unambiguously deﬁned.

≡

It is not trivial to deﬁne the right-hand
side of Newton’s second law, because, to this
aim, we must deﬁne the time-derivative of

≡

m(v)v) in
a vector (the momentum P
the space endowed with the time-dependent
Riemannian metric g. A unique deﬁnition
has been derived for this time-derivative,
from constraints which, I argue, must indeed
be imposed [34]. This is in fact a mathemat-
ical result that applies independently of the
theory of gravitation, although the deﬁnition
had ﬁrst been found in the framework of
the investigated theory [8]. Thus, the r.h.s.
of Newton’s second law is uniquely deﬁned
for any theory of gravitation in a curved
space-time. Einstein’s geodesic motion is
characterized by a particular form of the
gravity acceleration vector g, which depends,
in the general case of a time-dependent
metric, on the velocity of the particle as
well as on its position [34]. Thus, geodesic
motion takes place if and only if a particular
form is assumed for g. The “if” part means
that the four scalar equations involved in the
geodesic equation are derived from the three
ones in the extension of Newton’s second law
[34]. In the investigated theory, in which the
assumed gravity acceleration (6) does not
depend on the velocity of the test particle,
geodesic motion is recovered for a constant
gravitational ﬁeld.

Dynamics being thus deﬁned for a test par-
ticle, it is hence deﬁned for a dust, which is a
continuous medium made of non-interacting
test particles. The dynamics of a test particle
may be written in terms of its 4-acceleration
vector, i.e. the absolute derivative of the 4-
velocity U = (U µ) [34], and in this form it
is then immediately transcribed as an equa-
tion for the energy-momentum tensor T µν

theory
(with the “anisotropic” space metric (18)).
Although that theory is much simpler than
GR, 8 it is more complex than Newtonian
gravity (NG). Since
remains
approximately valid for a weak gravitational
ﬁeld, one has to develop a “post-Newtonian”
(PN) approximation scheme, allowing to
calculate the corrections to NG. This should
be done in following the general principles
of asymptotic analysis. Hence one should
introduce a family of gravitational systems,
depending on a ﬁeld-strength parameter λ,
and that family should be deduced from
the data of the system of physical interest
(e.g. the solar system), which system must
correspond to a small value λ0 of λ. 9

The result of developing this “asymptotic”
PN scheme for the scalar theory is that the
in the “anisotropic-metric” version,
latter,

8 Because:

i) it is a scalar theory instead of a
tensor one, ii) it has a ﬁxed (and ﬂat) background
metric (whereas, in GR, even the space-time as a dif-
ferentiable manifold cannot be considered given inde-
pendently of the metric [36], which leads to the ne-
cessity of adding gauge equations), and iii) there are
no constraint equations to be imposed on the initial
data (whereas, in GR, the time-time and time-space
components of the Einstein equations actually impose
four nonlinear constraints on the space metric and its
time-derivative [37])

9 This has been done for the scalar theory; it has
been done in a very particular case and in an incom-
plete way for GR; see Ref. [32] and references therein.

(Indices are raised and lowered with metric
γ, and semicolon means covariant diﬀerenti-

gravitation and the mass-energy equivalence
mean exactly that this equation must hold
true for a general continuous medium—be it a
material or also a nongravitational ﬁeld, such
as the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In particular,
the modiﬁcation of the Maxwell equations in
a gravitational ﬁeld is derived from this equa-
tion [35]. Equation (22) with the deﬁnition
(23) is valid in coordinates (yµ) adapted to
the preferred frame E and such that the time
coordinate is y0 = φ(T ) with T the absolute
time (see before Eq. (17)). When combined
with the equation for the scalar ﬁeld [Eq. (21)
if the “anisotropic” metric (18) is assumed],
Eq. (22) implies a local conservation equa-
tion for the energy, which substitutes for the
mass conservation of Newtonian theory: ex-
cept for a dust, mass is not exactly conserved,
although it is extremely close to be so in usual
conditions [9]. This is an original prediction
of the scalar theory.

itational eﬀects on light rays as the eﬀects
deduced in GR from the Schwarzschild met-
ric [28]. Moreover, the “asymptotic” 1PN
equations of motion of the mass centers of
a weakly gravitating system have been de-
rived and numerically implemented, and their
coeﬃcients have been least-squares-adjusted
on a reference ephemeris:
it seems that the
ephemeris cannot be reproduced within 10′′
[31] and references
per century (see Ref.
therein).
I argue that one should adjust
the equations on direct observations (a hard
work), for an ephemeris already represents
a ﬁtting of direct observations by equations
derived from the reference theory (GR), us-
ing its standard (as opposed to “asymptotic”)
PN scheme [31]. Cosmology has also been in-
vestigated; in particular, the theory predicts
that the cosmic expansion must be acceler-
ated [13].

8 Conclusion

Euler’s ﬁnal comments on his interpretation
of gravity as Archimedes’ thrust in a ﬂuid
“ether”, translated at the end of Sect. 2,
seem to remain relevant today. Newton’s
instantaneous attraction at a distance is just
as impossible to “physically understand” as
it ever was, also for Newton himself. The
necessity of recovering Newton’s theory as
a weak-ﬁeld limit is a constraint on all the-
ories (including GR) that aim at modifying
Newton’s theory to make it match with SR.
By itself, this constraint does not bring any
improvement to our physical understand-

it ﬁts naturally
ing of gravity. However,
with the physical concept of gravity being
Archimedes’ thrust due to the macroscopic
pressure in a ﬂuid constitutive ether (i.e.,
assumed to be the unique substance in
the Universe, and of which the elementary
particles would be mere local organizations).
In this context, this constraint leads indeed
to attribute non-Newtonian properties to
gravity as a result of the compressibility
In the present paper, I have
of the ﬂuid.
shown that neither Euler’s ether (which is
external to the “basic particles” that make
matter), nor the macroscopic ﬁelds in the
constitutive ether, can obey classical ﬂuid
mechanics. This reinforces the interpretation
of the preferred reference frame of the theory
[6]–[9], according to which that frame would
be deﬁned by the average motion of the ﬂuid
“micro-ether”:
the gravitational ether or
“macro-ether” does not obey mechanics, for
its motion deﬁnes the very reference frame,
in which mechanics is primarily written.

Since gravitation is intrinsically a result of
the heterogeneity of “space” (i.e. , in the lan-
guage of the theory, of the pressure or equiv-
alently of the density in the macro-ether),
whereas special relativity assumes that space
is homogeneous, it follows that SR can ap-
ply only locally in the presence of gravitation.
And since the Lorentz contraction and time-
dilation in SR can be interpreted as resulting
from a variation in the “apparent” ether den-
sity, one is naturally led to postulate gravita-
tional contraction and time-dilation. In this
regard, the theory has been extended here,
by allowing that the gravitational contraction

16

can be isotropic, instead of occuring only in
the direction of the gravity acceleration as
previously assumed. This should solve the
diﬃculties found [29, 30] with the weak equiv-
alence principle.
It has also been displayed
the freedom which is left on the equation fo
the scalar gravitational ﬁeld (the “ether pres-
sure”). What is imposed is the dynamics,
which is deﬁned by an extension of Newton’s
second law, and that dynamics together with
the scalar ﬁeld equation must imply an en-
ergy conservation [8]. How this can be done
with the isotropic gravitational contraction,
will be shown soon.

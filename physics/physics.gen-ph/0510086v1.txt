ON THE ORIGIN OF THE ANOMALOUS
PRECESSION OF MERCURY’S PERIHELION

JAUME GIN´E

Abstract. Action at distance in Newtonian physics is replaced by
ﬁnite propagation speeds in classical post–Newtonian physics. As
a result, the diﬀerential equations of motion in Newtonian physics
are replaced by functional diﬀerential equations, where the delay
associated with the ﬁnite propagation speed is taken into account.
Newtonian equations of motion, with post–Newtonian corrections,
are often used to approximate the functional diﬀerential equations.
In [12] a simple atomic model based on a functional diﬀerential
equation which reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic model was
presented. The unique assumption was that the electrodynamic
interaction has a ﬁnite propagation speed. In [13] a simple grav-
itational model based on a functional diﬀerential equation which
gives a gravitational quantiﬁcation and an explanation of the mod-
iﬁed Titius–Bode law is described. Firstly, in this work, we recall
the calculations made by Einstein to arrive at the explanation of
the anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion. Secondly, we
recover an ancient work of Gerber in 1898 as a precursor of the re-
tarded theories, see [9]. In this paper Gerber gave an explanation
of the anomalous precession of the Mercury’s perihelion in terms
of a velocity–dependent potential. In this paper an explanation of
the anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion is given in terms
of a simple retarded potential, which, at ﬁrst order, coincides with
Gerber’s potential, and which agrees with the author’s previous
works [12, 13].

1. Introduction

In 1859 the French astronomer Le Verrier announced, based on many
years of careful observations and calculations, that the perihelion of the
planet Mercury evidently precesses at a slightly faster rate than can be
accounted for by Newtonian mechanics given the known distribution of

material in the solar system. This discovery led to two diﬀerent avenues
of research. Some people began to search for unknown material in the
solar system (possibly even a new planet) that would account for the
anomaly in Mercury’s orbit within the context of Newton’s laws. Oth-
ers considered possible ways of modifying or re–interpreting Newton’s
law of gravitation so that it would give Mercury’s precession for the
currently accepted distribution of matter. For a complete description
of the historical development of the problem see [16].

It should be noted that Mercury is not the only object in the solar
system that exhibits anomalous precession. The eﬀect is most notice-
able for objects near the Sun with highly elliptical orbits, but it can be
seen even in the nearly circular orbits of Venus and Earth, although the
discrepancy isn’t nearly so large as for Mercury. In addition, the aster-
oid Icarus is ideal for studying this eﬀect, because it has an extremely
elliptical orbit and periodically passes very close to the Sun.

Einstein found that the extra precession arises unavoidably from the
fundamental principles of General Relativity. The general problem of
the integration of the Einstein equations, given by

Rµν −

Rgµν =

8πG
c4 Tµν,

where Rµν is the Ricci tensor, R is the Ricci scalar, gµν is the metric
tensor and Tµν is the stress-energy tensor, is extremely diﬃcult and the
determination of the explicit solutions is only possible in a restrict num-
ber of cases. One of the most important is the Schwarzschild solution
for the case of a punctual mass or spherical and homogeneous and with
the assumption that the limit values in the inﬁnite of the gµν are the
galilean values. To determine the relativistic prediction for the advance
of an elliptical orbit, we take polar coordinates centered in the center
of mass of the central body. Assuming that the orbits remain perma-
nently in the equatorial plane (as in Newtonian theory), let’s work in
this single plane S = 0, so of course dS/dt and all higher derivatives
also vanish. Then, the term involving S in the Schwarzschild metric
drops out, leaving just

Obviously if ω = 0 this gives the Newton’s inverse-square law for radial
gravitational acceleration. With non–zero ω the term ω2r corresponds
to the Newtonian centripetal acceleration which, if we deﬁned the tan-
gential velocity v = ωr, would equal the classical v2/r. This term
serves to oﬀset the inward pull of gravity, but in the relativistic version
we ﬁnd not w2r but w2(r
3m). For values of r much greater than 3m
this diﬀerence can be neglected, but clearly if r approaches 3m we can
expect to see non–classical eﬀects, and of course if r ever becomes less
than 3m we would expect completely un–classical behavior. In fact,
this corresponds to the cases when an orbiting particle spirals into the
center, which never happens in classical theory.

The value of d2u/dθ2 in typical astronomical problems is numerically

Since m/h is so small, we can take just the ﬁrst–order term, and noting
that one cycle of the radial function will be completed when Ωθ =

precession per revolution is

We notice that the semi–latus L is approximately h2/m, so the amount
of precession per revolution (for slow moving objects in weak gravita-
tional ﬁelds, such as the planets in our solar system) can be written
as simply as 6πm/L, where m is the gravitational radius of the central
body. Taking into account the values for the Sun and the Mercury
planet, we obtain the value of 42.9195 arc seconds per century.

The observed precession of 43.1

0.5 arc seconds per century for
the planet Mercury is in close agreement with the theory.
In 1915,
Einstein [6, 7] proudly concluded his presentation of the vacuum ﬁeld
equations on General Relativity by pointing out that they explained
the anomalous precession of Mercury.

2. Gerber’s theory

At the end of the 19th century, theoretical physicists such as Gauss
and Weber were investigating modiﬁcations of the Coulomb inverse–
square law by introducing a velocity–dependent potential to represent
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, consistent with the ﬁnite propagation speed
of changes in the ﬁeld (i.e., the speed of electromagnetic waves).
It
was found that this same type of law, when applied to gravitation,
predicted perihelion advance for the two–body problem on the same
order of magnitude as actually observed for Mercury.
It became a
fairly popular activity in the 1890s for physicists to propose various
gravitational potentials based on ﬁnite propagation speed in order to
account for some or all of Mercury’s orbital precession. Oppenheim
published a review of these proposals in 1895, see [18, 19].
In fact,
this line of investigation goes back to the works of Laplace [14] in 1805
where it is presented a correction of the Newton force produced by the

(cid:18)

where h is the ﬁnite propagation speed. But this work didn’t ﬁnd echo
practically until the surroundings of 1880, when a series of works to es-
timate the gravitational ﬁnite propagation speed began. A brief list of
authors that used the hypothesis of the ﬁnite propagation speed is Th.
von Oppolzer (1883), J. von Hepperger (1889), R. Lehmann–Filhes
(1894), K. Schwarzschild (1900), H. Minkowski (1908), H. Poincar´e
(1908), W. Ritz (1909). In other works diﬀerent forms for the gravita-
tional potential were proposed; we can mention H. von Seeliger (1895)
and C. Neumann (1896). Under the inﬂuence of the electrodynamical
development made by F. Neumann (1845), W. Weber (1846) and B.
Riemann (1861), some authors began to think in modifying Newton’s
law adding terms which depend on the speeds of the involved bod-
ies, see for instance [24]. In 1870 F.G. Holzmuller [8] proposed a law
of gravitation of the same form that the electrodynamic Weber’s law,
given by

F =

Later, F. Tisserand [23] had used this law to study the anomalous pre-
cession of Mercury’s perihelion and he explained only 14.1 arc seconds
per century. In the same way O. Liman (1886) and M. L´evi (1890),
proposed a law of gravitation of the same form that the electrodynamic
Riemann’s law, given by

F =

where r1 and r2 are the position vectors of the particles m1 and m2,
respectively. The Riemann–Liman–L´evi law explained only 28 arc sec-
onds per century of the anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion.
Finally, M. L´evi, by means of a purely formal development, found a
force law that led to the observed exact value of the anomalous preces-
sion of Mercury’s perihelion. The theories to explain the form of the
proposed law forces are based, in general, in to do a parallelism be-
tween the electromagnetism and the gravitation and to propose what
is known as gravitational ﬁeld with a gravelectric component and with
a gravomagnetic component, see [1, 15] and references therein. Be-
low, in the next section, we will see that all these laws are, in fact,
developments until certain order of a retarded potential.

These lines of research were abandoned when it was deﬁnitively im-
planted Einstein’s Relativity theory. The typical result of such pro-
posals is a predicted non–Newtonian advance of orbital perihelia per
revolution of Cπm/(Lc2) where c is the posited speed of propagation,
m is the Sun’s mass, L is the semi–latus rectum of the orbit, and C
is a constant depending on the precise form of the assumed potential.
Of course, by Kepler’s law, we can express the mass m of the Sun in
terms of the semi–major axis a and the angular speed ω of an orbiting
planet as m = a3ω2. The angular speed can be expressed in terms of
the orbital period T (revolutions per second) as ω = 2π/T . In addi-
tion, we know from elementary geometry that the semi–latus rectum

As we have seen with C = 6 this formula gives the observed non–
Newtonian precession for planetary orbits, most notably Mercury’s 43
arc seconds per century, so the objective was to ﬁnd a potential that
gives C = 6. Of course, it’s trivial to do this in an ad hoc manner,
but scientists were attempting to ﬁnd some rational basis for a po-
tential with the required property. The most straightforward way of
incorporating a ﬁnite propagation speed into the law of gravity is to
simplistically substitute the retarded radial distance for the present
distance, which leads to a velocity–dependent potential of the form

but this V results in a value of C = 2, so it predicts only 14.1 arc sec-
onds per century for the anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion,
one third of the observed value.

In 1898 a German school teacher named Paul Gerber wrote a pa-
per in which he proposed a velocity–dependent potential that gives
C = 6, see [9]. Gerber prepared an expanded version of this paper in
1902, and this expanded paper was subsequently republished in 1917
in the Annalen der Physik [10] at the urging of Ernst Gehrcke, who
wished to call attention to Gerber’s approach as a possible alternative
to Einstein’s General Relativity. In [16] it is concluded with a specu-
lative re–construction of a semi–classical line of reasoning by which it
is actually possible to derive Gerber’s potential, albeit in a way that
evidently never occurred to Gerber.

The contribution to the Newtonian potential at a given location in
space at a given instant due to a mass m is strictly a function of the
distance of that mass from the given location at the same instant. In
other words, if we let r(t) denote the distance from the given location
to the mass particle at the time t, then the contribution of that mass
to the gravitational potential V (t) at the given location at the time t
is V (t) =
m/r(t). Thus, Newtonian gravity represents instantaneous
action at a distance, because the eﬀect of changing the position of a
gravitating mass is felt throughout the universe at the instant when
the mass moves. Needless to say, for the simple two–body problem this
potential gives stable elliptical orbits.

−

However, suppose the gravitational potential experienced by an ob-
ject depends not only on the radial distance from the gravitating source
but also on the derivative (with respect to time) of that distance.
Speciﬁcally, suppose the potential has the form

We are going to see that this velocity–dependent potential results
in elliptical orbits that precess by the same amounts as predicted by
General Relativity (to the lowest order of approximation), and of course
these fact agrees with the observed precession rates for the perihelia
of the planets, including Mercury (see below). The question, then, is
whether we can justify the use of this particular velocity–dependent
potential rather than the Newtonian potential V =
m/r(t). The
rational interpretation is totally discerned in [16]. We now review the
steps by which the correct precession is given by Gerber’s potential (5).
We will see that Gerber’s velocity–dependent potential gives the same
prediction for the precession of orbital perihelia (to the ﬁrst order for
weak ﬁelds) as does General Relativity.

On this basis, the proposal of a velocity-dependent potential function
(5) corresponds to the proposal of a certain gravitational force law,

Since equation (6) represents the force per unit mass, directed toward
the central gravitating mass m, it is equal to the radial acceleration.
To determine the acceleration of a point in the plane, we consider polar
coordinates (r, θ), where ω = dθ/dt is the angular velocity. Hence the
radial and tangential components of the point’s acceleration are:

ar = ¨r

rω2,

at = r ˙ω + 2 ˙rω.

There is no tangential force on the orbiting particle (according to Ger-
ber’s model), so we have

r ˙ω + 2 ˙rω =

r
It follows that the quantity inside the parentheses is a constant, which
we will denote as usually by h = r2ω. Equating the radial acceleration
with the radial speciﬁc force (up to second order), and reverting to
units such that c = 1, we get

(r2ω) = 0.

The quantities inside the parentheses are both nearly equal to unity, be-

of the reference angle θ, the general solution of this equation can be
expressed as u(θ) = (m/h2)[1 + k cos(θ/√A)], where k is a constant
of integration. Notice that, if the value of A is consistently greater
than 1, even if only by a very small amount, there is a cumulative
eﬀect, because the angle θ must increase by more than 2π in order for

the system to return to the same radial position. On each revolution
this extra angular displacement accumulates, so the spatial path of the
orbit undergoes a steady precession.

Reverting back to the parameter r = 1/u, the orbital equation is

r(θ) =

If σ were equal to unity, this would be the polar equation of an ellipse
with the pole at one focus, and with the constant k signifying the
eccentricity and h2/m signifying the semi–latus rectum L. The actual
value of σ depends on r, but for orbital motion the mean value of r
can be expressed in terms of the orbital constants. This fact is more
easily seen for the case of a circular orbit, so the derivatives of u with
respect to θ are all zero, and equation (8) immediately gives r = h2/m
(which of course is equivalent to Kepler’s third law, m = r3w2, since
h = mwr2). Substituting for r in the expression for σ, we get

This value is the same as Ω, as before, and therefore it gives the same
as the ﬁrst-order non-Newtonian precession predicted by General Rel-
ativity for weak ﬁelds. Gerber’s potential also gives values for all other
known bodies orbiting the Sun consistent with observation.

We should mention that although General Relativity and Gerber’s
potential predict the same ﬁrst-order precession (for weak ﬁelds), the
respective equations of motion are not identical, even at the ﬁrst non-
Newtonian level of approximation. In terms of the parameter u = 1/r
the equations of motion are

so the non–Newtonian terms are actually quite diﬀerent. Of course, any
non–Newtonian term will lead to orbits that fail to close, so there will be
some cumulative precession for the two-body problem. It just happens
that the term 3mu2 in the General Relativity equation of motion and
the term 6mu(d2u/dθ2) in Gerber’s equation of motion both result in
a ﬁrst-order precession of 6πm/L in the slow weak-ﬁeld limit. Thus
Gerber did not in any way anticipate the two-body equation of motion

predicted by General Relativity, let alone the ﬁeld equations from which
the relativistic equation of motion is derived.

The 1902 paper begins with 20 pages of text in which Gerber writes
in vague and qualitative terms about the idea that gravity has a ﬁnite
speed of propagation, and reviews the previous attempts to infer the
speed of gravity from observations of the solar system. Following Op-
penheim’s review article closely, he discusses Laplace, Weber, Riemann,
Neumann, Lehmann–Filhes and Hepperger, Clausius, and Lorentz. It
is not until Section IV that he begins to present his idea in precise
form, giving his derivation of the potential (5). In the introduction to
the 1917 re-print of Gerber’s paper, Ernst Gehrcke concludes:

Whether and how the theory of Gerber can be merged
with the well–known electromagnetic equations into a
new uniﬁed theory is a diﬃcult problem, which still
awaits a solution.

3. A simple retarded potential

Action at distance in Newtonian physics is replaced by ﬁnite prop-
agation speeds in classical post–Newtonian physics. As a result, the
diﬀerential equations of motion in Newtonian physics are replaced by
functional diﬀerential equations, where the delay associated with the
ﬁnite propagation speed is taken into account. Newtonian equations
of motion, with post–Newtonian corrections, are often used to approx-
imate the functional diﬀerential equations, see, for instance, [2, 3, 4, 5,
11, 21, 22]. In [12] a simple atomic model based on a functional dif-
ferential equation which reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic model
was presented. The unique assumption was that the electrodynamic
interaction has ﬁnite propagation speed, which is a consequence of the
Relativity theory. An straightforward consequence of the theory devel-
oped in [12], and taking into account that gravitational interaction has
also a ﬁnite propagation speed, is that the same model is applicable to
the gravitational 2-body problem. In [13] a simple gravitational model
based on a functional diﬀerential equation which gives a gravitational
quantiﬁcation and an explanation of the modiﬁed Titius–Bode law is
described. In the following an explanation of the anomalous precession
of Mercury’s perihelion is given in terms of a simple retarded potential,
which, at ﬁrst order, coincides with the Gerber’s potential.

The most straightforward way of incorporating a ﬁnite propagation
speed into the law of gravity is to simplistically substitute the present

distance for the retarded radial distance, therefore, we consider the
simplest retarded potential

−

where r(t) denotes the instantaneous position vector of the test par-
ticle, at time t, and τ is the delay, so that r(t
τ ) is the retarded
position of the test particle. In fact this retarded potential depends on
the position vector but also on the velocity vector ˙r, on the acceler-
ation vector ¨r an so on. The appearance of a delay implies all these
dependences in the potential. From the retarded potential (9) we will
obtain, in a theoretical point of view, the equation of motion of the
particle. This equation will be a functional diﬀerential equation. The
functional diﬀerential equations of motion are generally diﬃcult, often
impossible, to express in a form that is amenable to analysis. Thus, in
order to obtain useful dynamical predictions from realistic models, it
is frequent to replace the functional diﬀerential equations of motion by
approximations that are ordinary or partial diﬀerential equations, see
[2]. In our case, if we develop the retarded potential (9) in powers of τ
(up to second order in τ ), we obtain

To develop some easier calculations we can reject on the right hand

and only gives terms of higher order). Hence, at this approximation,
we obtain the velocity–dependent potential

In a ﬁrst approximation, the delay τ must be equal to r/c (the time that
the ﬁeld uses to go from Mercury to the Sun at the speed of the light)
and according with the theories developed in [12, 13], we introduce a
new constant g in the delay and hence, τ = g r/c. Introducing this
expression of the delay in (12) we have

It is easy to see that if we ﬁx g = √3, we obtain the same radial
force, at ﬁrst orders, that gives Gerber’s potential, see (6).
In fact,
we have constructed a potential that, varying g, predicts 2g2πm/(Lc2)
as non–Newtonian advance of orbital perihelia per revolution. Note
that for g = 1, it results in a value of C = 2, so it predicts only 14.1
arc seconds per century for the precession of Mercury’s perihelion, one
third of the observed value. The problem of the retarded potential (9)
is that it can account for the anomalous precession of the Mercury’s
perihelion precisely by adjusting a free parameter of the theory. In the
following we give a retarded potential which gives an explanation of
the anomalous precession of the Mercury’s perihelion without adjusting
any free parameter of the theory. We will see that this new retarded
potential also coincides, at ﬁrst order, with Gerber’s one.

We now consider a small modiﬁcation of the retarded potential (9),

given by

where the modiﬁcation consists on dividing the retarded potential (9)
by the quotient r(t

the distance between the masses when the potential was “emitted” to
distance between the masses at the present instant. We can think that
the retarded potential (9) was obtained from the Newtonian potential

to place, and assumed a ﬁnite speed for the propagation of this infor-
mation.

Figure 1. The retarded position of the test particle.

A particle sends forth a potential, the value of which depends not
only on the emitting particle, but on the receiving particle. Therefore,
the information must come back from the receiving particle to the
emitting particle. Thus we ought to regard an elementary interaction
not as a one-way exchange, but as a two-way round-trip exchange.
Hence, we must apply the corrective factor twice in the initial potential.
In fact the correct expression of the retarded potential, taking into
account that the information must do a two-way round-trip and that
τ = r(t)/c, is

taking into account that τ = r(t)/c. Hence, the correct retarded po-
tential is (14), but is a functional potential which is diﬃcult to express
in a form that is amenable to analysis. Therefore, we use the approx-
imation (13) whose physical interpretation and use is totally justiﬁed.
In fact the retarded potential (13) is a generalization of the Gerber’s
potential. The Gerber’s potential is the particular case when the veloc-
ity of the test particle is constant, i.e., when ¨r = 0. In [16] a physical
explanation (albeit in a way that evidently never occurred to Gerber)
of the form of the Gerber’s potential is given.

Now we are going to see that the retarded potential (13) gives an ex-
planation of the anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion because
coincides, at ﬁrst order, with the force law associated to Gerber’s one.
If we develop the retarded potential (13) in powers of τ (up to second
order in τ ), we obtain

4. Concluding remarks

Therefore the anomalous precession of the Mercury’s perihelion is,
in fact, to take into account the second order in the delay of the re-
tarded potential (13) which is an approximation of the correct retarded
potential (14). It lacks to see if the prediction for the deﬂection of elec-
tromagnetic waves grazing the Sun using this potential coincide with
value given by General Relativity, assuming a plausible application of
such potential to the propagation of electromagnetic waves. We hope
to give an answer in a future work.

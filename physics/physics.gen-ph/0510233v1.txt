Abstract

The graviton scattering in IIB superstring theory is examined in the context
of S-duality and symmetry. There is an algebra that generates all of the terms in
the four-point function to any order in derivatives. A map from the algebra to the
scattering is given; it suggests the correctness of the full four-point function with the
S-duality. The higher point functions are expected to follow a similar pattern.

Introduction

Derivative corrections to the IIB superstring low-energy eﬀective action at the
four-point function have been investigated in many works [5]-[13] . Complete formal
perturbative results are known up to the genus two level, due to the complicated
nature of the integrals involved [1]-[2].

There are also several conjectures for the full four-point function, including in-
stantons [3]-[5]. The original conjecture of [4] based on the Eisenstein functions failed
to agree with genus one perturbation theory. The conjecture in [3] was ambiguous up
to relative coeﬃcients of the pairings of non-holomorphic Eisenstein functions; this
seems to be straightened out by imposing a diﬀerential condition on the modular
construction, in [5].

In this work, the systematics of the full four-point function in the currently ac-
cepted conjecture is examined. The organization of the perturbative corrections is
given in an organized manner, and illustrates some symmetry that is unknown in the
superstring. The four-point function can be found by expanding the function,

which is also known to be very close to certain vertex algebras. Similar functions
are conjectured to generate the higher-point functions. The fact that the conjectured
form of the amplitude can be found by expanding such a simple partition function
appears to support its validity. The form of the modular ansatz is reviewed only
brieﬂy in this work.

The action in (2) does not include the terms which contain the unitarity cuts. The
coeﬃcients gk can be computed in string perturbation theory, and is diﬃcult to obtain
beyond genus two.

Imposing modular invariance, in the Einstein frame of the metric, requires that
the functions gk be invariant under fractional linear transformations. Finding the
functions gk at the four-point level has been investigated in many papers, with consis-
tency checks. The reﬁned conjecture is investigated in this work, with the coeﬃcients
gk proportional to Z{s} functions. The latter functions obey a speciﬁc diﬀerential
equation, and are roughly proportional to products of Eisenstein functions. This
ansatz is investigated here, and with an emphasis on extracting further symmetry.

The zeta functions take values in the odd integers excluding unity. In order to ﬁnd
the kinematic structure of the invidual terms, an identity is required that expands
the Mandelstam invariants in an appropriate basis. For example,

Quantum Extension and Symmetry

In this section a set of quantum rules is deﬁned that generates the graviton am-
plitudes. The partitions of numbers are useful in parameterizing these contributions;
also these partitions are connected to a fundamental symmetry of the quantum theory.

There have been several proposals for the quantum completion of the S-matrix,
and higher derivative terms up to genus two have been computed. The modular
invariant completion due to S-duality enforces certain structures on the coupling de-
pendence. A basis for the coupling structure is formed from the Eisenstein functions,
the contribution of which have recently been elucidated more completely in [5].

The polynomial system generating the perturbative contributions can be deter-
mined from a graphical illustration and also through a ’vertex’ algebra. The latter
can be found from expanding the function,

Yn=1
which is similar to the partition function of a boson on the torus,

−

(30)

(32)

(33)

The latter is associated to a vertex algebra. The former will be shown to correspond
to the perturbative four-point function, without the non-analytic terms required by
unitarity.

There are a set of trees as depicted in ﬁgure 1. Each tree is found by taking a
number N, an odd number, and partitioning it into odd numbers 3, 5, 7, . . .. At each
pair of nodes the numbers in the partition are attached. The partition is labeled by
the set N(

The nodes of the trees are chosen, one from each pair, and a set of lines could be

drawn between these nodes. For each tree there are

ways of partitioning the tree into the same number of ’up’ and ’down’ nodes. Each tree

The derivative terms are labeled by

2kR4 with k either half integral or integral
2k, the tree system is found by partitioning
starting at k = 0. At a speciﬁc order
the number N = 2k + 3. The number of partitions a number N can have into odd
numbers, excluding unity, is denoted Podd(N). The perturbative contributions to this
derivative order are found as follows,

1) attach weights to the nodes of the tree

2) take the product of the weights of the nodes in the tree

3) add the sums of the products

The sum of the products reintroduces the contribution of the modular ansatz to the
four-point scattering.

For reference, the genus truncation property holds at gmax = 1

2(2k + 2)
for k = n/2 with n either odd or even. There are Podd(2k + 3) partitions of 2k + 3
into odd numbers excluding unity, with a maximum number. The genus truncation
follows from the fact that there a maximum number of nodes in the tree.

Some examples of the partitions of numbers at a given derivative order

2kR4
are described in the following table. For example, at k = 4, the number 11 can be
partitioned into 11 and 3 + 3 + 5, with counts of 21 and 23.

k = 4

Each perturbative contribution is found by multiplying the node contributions. There
are the various weighted trees that contribute to the perturbative contribution at
2k + 3, when partitioned into the various odd numbers. Each contribution has the
weighted factor of B in the product. (The weighted trees resemble a fermionic system
with gmax fermions with a quantum level degeneracy non-identical fermions.) The
partitioning of the number 2k + 3 into the weighted trees is a convenient way of
describing all of the contributions to the particular derivative term.

Partitions

function

Basically the perturbative contributions to the four-point function come about
from partitioning an integer 2k+3 into odd numbers 3, 5, 7, . . ., and then subsequently
choosing one of two choices for each number in the partition.

The partition of a number into odd numbers can be achieved by expanding the

In the CFT language, the function O(N) arises from a scalar on the torus. The

O1(N) function has one mode deleted, and represents a non-modular modiﬁcation.

To complete the count of the number of tree systems the factor of two must be

added to each of the nodes. The number of trees is,

Higher-Point Functions

The higher point functions require expanding the function √g 2kR4 to higher
order in the plane wave expansion, which stems essentially from the √g. There are
also terms with higher numbers of curvatures, requiring Rp at p-point. The tree
amplitudes of the higher point functions are not currently avalable in the literature,
in either an expanded or closed form.

One conjecture for the higher derivative terms at p-point would be to take the

form,

with the

2ni +1 = 5, 7, . . .. The sum indicates that there are this number of vertices
2ni +1 = 5 on up; likewise, at p = 7

P

11

P

the sum starts at 9. The tensor combination here is for the terms with the maximum
number of s invariants, and the tensor function cns
n,m pertains to the p-point. Also, the
helicity structure is found from the particular combination in the collection of Weyl
tensors.

The origin of the ζ(3) in the R4 stems from the fact that there are two vertices,
with a massive propagator between them. In the low-energy limit of the string am-
plitude, this results in an inﬁnite sum of the massive modes, with a 1/n coming from
each vertex and also the propagator. At higher point, the sum of the massive modes
requires more vertices, and results in the tree-level ζ function starting out at 2p
5,
which is the number of vertices and propagators in a skeleton graph; this graph is a
ladder tree diagram with m

4 external gravitons on the internal rung.

−

−

Internal gravitons within the tree diagram enforce the entire tree diagram to be
built of gravitons. This is in the absence of a massive-graviton-graviton vertex (or
massive-graviton ... graviton vertex). Of course, at four-point we know there is a
massive-graviton-graviton vertex, with a factor of 1/n from the vertex. The ladder
diagrams result in the local terms in the amplitudes, that is without any 1/
terms
in the low energy eﬀective action. And each replacement of the massive mode by a
graviton eliminates two factors of 1/n in the inﬁnite sum; this lowers the ζ function
value by two.

Assuming the ζ function takes on values in the tree diagrams at p-point beginning

at 2p

5, it is natural to think that the partition function,

−

p+3

Xi=0 Yn=2p−5−2i

(1

−

2x2n+1)

,

(46)

would be able to generate these scattering amplitudes. The helicity tensor from the
R2p and the tensor function cns,...
n,m is required. Without more information this is just
a partial conjecture for the form of the amplitude, however, the partition function
seems appropriate. The terms with i
= 1 correspond to diagrams without the maximal
number of internal massive modes; these diagrams produce potential 1/
terms in
the low-energy eﬀective action. (For example, at four-point, there is a contribution
1 R4 contribution from the GR graphs.)

Conclusion

The systematics of the four-point amplitude according to the S-duality of the
IIB superstring is explored and delimited. The systematics entail the partitioning

12

6
of numbers and the construction of weighted trees. The entire four-point function,
without the non-analytic terms, can be found through a simple construction.

The procedure of ﬁnding the four-point function is found by expanding a partic-
ular partition function. This partition function should be related to the S-duality of
the IIB superstring. The simplicity of the generating function,

1
2x2n+1)

,

(1

−

Yi=1

(47)

does seem to suggest the correctness of the four-point function. The higher point
functions have similar partition functions.

The form of the amplitude can be used to deduce contributions in the massless
sector, that is maximal supergravity. These calculations are typically very compli-
cated, especially at the multi-loop level. The techniques for doing these cancellations
are improving, and possible cancellations leading to better ultra-violet behavior be-
yond those up to ﬁve loops have been investigated in [14]-[16].

The origin of the simple partition function that generates the scattering seems not
clear. There could be some additional symmetry beyond the naive supersymmetry
and S-duality, or an extension as a result of the two. Some indication of this is
examined in [17]. Vertex algebras are generated by these partition functions [18].

We speculate that quantum phenomena may be caused by the interactions between the particles
and a ﬂuid ﬁlling the universe which may be called aether or tao. Following the same method of
Nelson’s stochastic mechanics, we show that the Schr¨odinger equation can be derived from Newton’s
second law based on a hypothesis about the random force exerted on particles.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Schr¨odinger equation for a non-relativistic particle

moving in a potential V can be written as [1]

i~ ∂ψ
∂t

=

~2

−

2m ∇

2ψ + V ψ

(1)

∇

2 = ∂2

∂x2 + ∂2

where ψ is the wave function, m is the mass of the parti-
cle, V is the potential, ~ = h/2π, h is the Plank constant,
∂y2 + ∂2
∂z2 is the Laplace operator.
t is time,
This equation was discovered by E. Schr¨odinger in 1926
to interpret energy quantization of atoms as an eigen-
value problem. It is known that the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion (1) is a fundamental hypothesis in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics [1].

The main purpose of this paper is to present a stochas-
tic interpretation of quantum phenomena and calculate
the Plank constant h based on a ﬂuidic continuum model
of vacuum and a sink ﬂow model of particles [2].

The motive of this paper is to seek a mechanism of
quantum phenomena. The reasons why new interpreta-
tions of quantum mechanics are interesting may be sum-
marized as follows.

Firstly, we have little knowledge about the origin of
quantum phenomena since the discovery of the energy
quanta in 1900 by M. Planck. Although we can apply the
Schr¨odinger equation to describe some non-relativistic
quantum phenomena, the origin of quantum phenomena
remains an unsoled problem in physics for more than 100
years, for instance, see [3, 4].

Secondly, although the axiomatic system of quantum
mechanics was ﬁrmly established since 1926, the inter-
pretation of quantum mechanics is still a controversial
issue, for instance, see [3, 4].

Thirdly, there exists some paradoxes in quantum me-
chanics [5, 6], for instance, the paradox of reduction of
the wave packet, the EPR paradox [7, 8, 9], the paradox
of Schr¨odinger cat [10, 11, 12], the paradox of Wigner’s
friend [13]. New interpretations of quantum mechanics
may solve such problems, for instance, see [14, 15, 16].

Fourthly, we do not have a satisfactory quantum the-
ory of gravity presently [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] . One of
the challenges in physics is to reconcile quantum theory
and theory of general relativity [17, 22]. New theories of
quantum phenomena may open new ways to solve this
problem.

Finally, one of the tasks of physics is the uniﬁcation of
the four fundamental interactions in the universe. New
theories of quantum phenomena may shed some light on
this puzzle.

To conclude, it seems that new considerations on quan-
tum phenomena is needed. It is worthy keeping an open
mind with respect to all the theories of quantum phe-
nomena before the above problems been solved.

Now let us brieﬂy review the history of stochastic in-

terpretations of quantum mechanics.

The idea that microscopic particles may undertake
stochastic motions is almost as old as quantum mechanics
itself [4].

Schr¨odinger and F¨urth [23, 24, 25] observed the formal
analogy between his equation (1) and the diﬀusion equa-
tion (2). This analogy was further discussed by Comisar
[26].
Inspired by Smoluchowski’s dynamical theory of
Brownian motion, F¨urth [4, 24] obtained a diﬀusion-
theoretic relation
D. He observed the formal
analogy between this inequality and the Heisenberg rela-
tion

In 1926-1927, Luis de Broglie proposed an interpre-
tation of the Schr¨odinger equation in terms of particle
trajectories [27, 28, 29]. Bohm developed de Broglie’s
interpretation and introduced the concept of quantum-
mechanical potential [30].

Bohm and Vigier [31] introduced a non-dissipative fric-
tionless sub-quantum medium, i.e. a real covariant aether
of the Dirac type [32], to interpret observed quantum
ﬂuctuations.

In 1932 [33], Wigner suggested that it is possible to to
reformulate quantum mechanics in terms of phase space
ensembles [4].

The axiomatic system of the theory of probability es-

1

tablished by Kolmogorov in 1933 [34, 35] gives a ﬁrm and
rigorous foundation of the theory of stochastic processes
and Nelson’s stochastic mechanics.

F´enyes [36] proposed a interpretation of quantum me-
chanics based on a Markov process. F´enyes’ work was
developed by Weizel [37, 38, 39]and discussed by Ker-
shaw [40].

According to Luis de Broglie [41], the success of the

of hidden Brownian motions of particles. Luis de Broglie
called this kind of hidden motions as quasi-Brownian mo-
tions [41].

If the stochastic motions of particles is responsible for
the quantum phenomena, then we may establish an ex-
plicit theory of quantum phenomena. This theory may
be more fundamental and more powerful than quantum
mechanics. The Schr¨odinger equation will no longer be a
basic hypothesis and will be derived based on other logi-
cally more economic hypotheses naturally in this theory.
Indeed, in a remarkable paper published in 1966 [14],
E. Nelson derived the Schr¨odinger equation by means of
theory of stochastic processes based on a hypothesis that
every particle of mass m in vacuum, or let us say the
aether, is subject to Brownian motion with diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient ~/2m. This achievement may be considered a
triumph of the stochastic interpretation of quantum me-
chanics.

Nelson’s stochastic mechanics [14, 15, 16]was further
developed, for instance, see [25, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48].
In 1988 [49], P. N. Kaloyerou J. P. Vigier thought
that Nelson’s frictionless assumption may only be an ap-
proximate idealisation and derived a frictional non-linear
Schr¨odinger equation Eq.(44) following the same proce-
dures in [14].

Besides stochastic mechanics, other research routines
are also being developed in the study of the relationships
between stochastic processes and quantum physics.

Based on the hypothesis of the stochastic properties
of the electromagnetic vacuum, stochastic electrodynam-
ics was established and developed since Nernst [50] in-
troduced the concept of the zeropoint ﬁeld in 1916, for
instance, see [25, 51, 52].

In 1981, Parisi-Wu [53] showed that the usual quantum
theory is reproduced by the thermal equilibrium limit of
a stochastic Langevin dynamics. Parisi-Wu’s stochastic
quantization method was further developed, for instance,
see [54, 55, 56, 57].

Besides stochastic interpretation of quantum mechan-
ics, there are other probabilistic interpretations of quan-
tum mechanics, e.g., the statistical interpretation. Ac-
cording to Jammer[4], the statistical interpretation of
quantum mechanics was ﬁrst introduced by Einstein on
the 1927 Solvay Congress. The basic assumption of the
statistical interpretation is that the quantum mechanical
description refers to an ensemble of similarly prepared

systems, not to an individual member of it.

The statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics is
strongly supported by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [7],
etc.

I regret to admit that it is impossible for me to mention

all the works related to this ﬁeld in history.

Recently [2], we speculate that the universe may be
ﬁlled with a kind of ﬂuid which may be called tao. Thus,
Newton’s law of gravitation is derived by methods of hy-
drodynamics based on a sink ﬂow model of particles.

Inspired by the above mentioned works, we speculate
that quantum phenomena may stem from the stochastic
motions of particles immersed in the tao. Following the
same method of Nelson’s stochastic mechanics, we show
that the Schr¨odinger equation can be derived from New-
ton’s second law based on a hypothesis about the random
force exerted on the particles by the tao.

II. BRIEF REVIEW OF STOCHASTIC
MECHANICS

The purpose of this section is to brieﬂy review some
important theories of stochastic mechanics in the history.
In 1827 [58, 59], Robert Brown looked at some pol-
lens suspended in water through a microscope. He found
that the pollens were undertaking some very irregular
motions. Now such stochastic motions is called Brown-
ian motion.

In 1900-1901, Bachelier noted the relationship between
Brownian motion and the diﬀusion equation (2). He also
introduced the process of Brownian motion to describe
the random movements of stock prices in stock markets
[35]. Bachelier’s work may be considered as the ﬁrst
mathematical treatment of Brownian motion.

The atomic theory is the foundation of the kinetic the-
ory of gases. The existence of atoms and molecules was
the belief of C. Maxwell, R. Clausius and L. Boltamann
who were important contributors of the kinetic theory of
gases in the 19th century. The motivation of Einstein’s
work on the theory of Brownian motion was to ﬁnd some
facts which would convince the atomic theory [60].

Making certain probabilistic assumptions, Einstein de-

rived the diﬀusion equation [15, 60]

Brownian particle is at the point (x, y, z) at time t, D > 0
2 is the Laplace
is the coeﬃcient of diﬀusion, t is time,
operator.

∇

Einstein’s theory may be considered as the ﬁrst mathe-
matical theory of Brownian motion. Although Einstein’s
theory of Brownian motion is not a dynamical theory
and only determines the character of the motion and the

2

value of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient based on some assump-
tions, it gives a possible experimental way to convince
the existence of atoms and molecules.

Smoluchowski developed a dynamical theory of Brow-
nian motion independently [61]. Smoluchowski’s theory
was further developed [14, 15, 16].

Although the concepts of atom and molecular has been
discussed by the atomists in ancient Greece more than
2000 years ago, e.g. Democritus, the existence of atom
and molecular were not conﬁrmed until 1908. In 1908, a
series of experiments performed by a team leaded by J.
B. Perrin obtained indirect but convincing evidences and
data to support the atomic theory [62, 63].

Langevin was the ﬁrst to apply Newton’s second law to
describe Brownian motion. For simplicity, we may con-
sider the one dimensional motion of a Brownian particle.
Let x(t) denote the position of a Brownian particle at
time t in a one dimensional Cartesian coordinats
.
o, x
}
We assume that the velocity dx(t)/dt and the accelera-
tion d2x(t)/dt2 exist. Suppose there is a frictional force
and a random force exerted on the Brownian particle.
Then, according to the Newton’s second law, Langevin
obtained

{

dt2 =

−

+ Fx + ξx,

(3)

where m is the mass of the particle, f is the drag coeﬃ-
cient due to the friction of the liquid, ξx are the random
forces with zero mathematical expectation, Fx are other
forces.

Eqs.(3) is called the Langevin equation. Langevin
equation may be regarded as the ﬁrst random diﬀerential
equation in the history, although it remained formal until
the emergence of modern theory of stochastic integral in
1944, see, for instance,[35, 64, 65, 66, 67].

Fokker and Planck used the Fokker-Planck equations
to describe the probability density of Brownian particles
[68].

In 1923 [35], Wiener established a rigorous mathemat-
ical theory of Brownian motion. Now Brownian motion
is usually called Wiener process by mathematicians [35].
In 1930, L. S. Ornstein and G. E. Uhlenbeck estab-

lished another dynamical theory of Brownian motion.

It is known that macroscopic phenomena in physics are
usually described by deterministic diﬀerential equations,
e.g., the diﬀusion equation (2) in thermodynamics, the
Navier-Stokes equation in ﬂuid mechanics, the Maxwell’s
equations in electrodynamics, etc. On the other hand,
the atomic picture of the universe is widely accepted
since the existence of atoms and moleculars were con-
ﬁrmed in 1908 by a series of experiments performed by a
team leaded by Perrin [62, 63]. From the point view of
a atomism, all the atoms are performing some kinds of
highly irregular stochastic motions. How can we recon-
cile this sharp contrast between the deterministic picture
and stochastic pictures of the nature? In a remarkable

paper published in 1931 [69], Kolmogorov established
the relationships between parabolic diﬀerential equations
and continuous time Markov processes. Kolmogorov’s
analytic method of stochastic processes provides us a
powerful mathematical tool to bridge the macroscopic
world and the microscopic world. Kolmogorov’s work was
further developed by Feller, Kac, Doob, Dynkin, Ray,
Volkonsky, Itˆo, McKean, Skorohod, Varadhan, Watan-
abe, Pekins, Le Gall, etc., see, for instance, [35, 70, 71].
It is known that the theory of probability remained
a confusable and controversial theory until Kolmogorov
establish a axiomatic system of the theory of probability
in 1933 [34, 35]. For historical and bibliographical notes
of modern theory of probability, please refer to [35].

Doob gave a rigorous discussion of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck

theory of Brownian motion in 1942 [35, 72].

Now let us review the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory of
Brownian motion. For simplicity, we consider the one
dimensional motion of a free Brownian particle. Let x(t)
denote the position of a Brownian particle at time t. We
assume that the velocity v = dx/dt exists. Suppose there
is a drag force Fd and a rapidly ﬂuctuating random force
ξ(t) exerted on the Brownian particle. Thus, according to
Newton’s second law, the motion of the Brownian particle
may be described by

Suppose the frictional force Fd exerted on the Brown-

ian particle by the ﬂuid has the following form

m

d2x
dt2 = Fd + ξ(t).

Fd =

f v(t),

−

(4)

(5)

where f > 0 is the drag coeﬃcient.

The random force ξ(t) is not a deterministic function
of time t, but a rapidly ﬂuctuating and highly irregular
function. Therefore, we need a appropriate mathematical
model of the random force ξ(t) to ensure that the Eq.(4)
is mathematically explicit. Such mathematical models
have already been established and be widely used in sci-
ence and engineering [66, 73, 74].

The most widely used mathematical model of such
rapidly varying random functions is Gaussian white
noise. For deﬁnition and discussion of white noise, see,
for instance, [66, 73, 74, 75]. Now, let us suppose that
the random force ξ(t) in Eq.(4) is a Gaussian white noise,
i.e., ξ(t) is a stationary Gaussian generalized process with
zero mean and a correlation function

R(t, s) = E[ξ(t)ξ(s)] = σ2

1δ(t

s),

−

(6)

where σ1 > 0 is a constant and may be called the strength
of ξ(t), δ(t) is Dirac’s delta function, E denotes the oper-
ation of mathematical expectation. For convenience, we
can introduce a deﬁnition R(t, s) = Γ(t
s). Thus, we
have Γ(τ ) = σ2

1δ(τ ).

the spectral density S(ω) of ξ(t) is

Thus, Eqs.(11) become

In 1966 [14, 15, 16], E. Nelson introduced a hypothesis
that every particle of mass m in vacuum, or let us say
the aether, is subject to Brownian motion with diﬀusion
coeﬃcient ~/2m. Thus, Nelson derived the Schr¨odinger

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

For convenience, we may introduce a deﬁnition

Therefore, from Eq.(10) and Eq.(24), the strength of

the Gaussian white noise ξ(t) is

(36)

(37)

(39)

equation Eq.(1) by means of the theory of stochastic pro-
cesses.

Nelson’s derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation Eq.(1)

Then, based on the above deﬁnitions, Nelson demon-
strated the following equations by means of theory of
stochastic processes

may be summarized as follows.

Suppose a Brownian particle is moving in an external
force ﬁeld F. Let y(t) denote the position of a Brownian
particle at time t.

Nelson thought that we cannot attribute any friction
to the aether, for then we could distinguish absolute rest
from uniform motion.

Nelson assume that the position y(t) satisﬁed the

Smoluchowski equation

dy(t) = b(y, t)dt + dw(t),

w(t)
w(s) independent of w(r) whenever r < s < t. Let
ν denotes the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the Wiener process
w(t).

Nelson deﬁned the mean forward derivative Dy(t) as

where m is the mass of the particle, ~ = h/2π, h is the
Plank constant.

Suppose the external force ﬁeld is the gradient of a

potential V . Then, we have F =

(30)

where w∗(t) has the same properties as w(t) except that
the dw∗(t) are independent of the y(s) with s

t.

Then, Nelson introduced the deﬁnitions of mean for-
ward velocity Dy(t) and mean backward velocity D∗y(t)
as

Dy(t) = b(y, t), D∗y(t) = b∗(y, t).

a means of introducing friction into the deﬁning equa-
tions of Nelson. Thus, they derived a frictional non-linear
Schr¨odinger equation following the same procedures in
[14]. This non-linear Schr¨odinger equation, which may

III. A FLUIDIC CONTINUUM MODEL OF
VACUUM AND A SINK FLOW MODEL OF
PARTICLES

The purpose of this section is to brieﬂy review a ﬂuidic
continuum model of vacuum and a sink ﬂow model of
particles proposed in [2].

Since quantum theory shows that vacuum is not empty
and has physical eﬀects, we introduce a hypothesis that
the universe is ﬁlled by a ﬂuidic continuum. The ﬂuid
fulﬁll the following conditions, (1) the ﬂuid is an ideal
ﬂuid, (2) the ﬂuid is irrotational and barotropic, (3) the
density ρt of the ﬂuid is homogeneous, (4) there are no
external body forces exerted on the ﬂuid, (5) the ﬂuid is
unbounded and the velocity of the ﬂuid at the inﬁnity
is approaching to zero. This ﬂuid was named tao after
Laozi [77] in order to distinguish with Cartesian aether
[78].

Following Einstein, Infeld and Hoﬀmann, who intro-
duced the idea that particles may be looked as singulari-
ties in ﬁelds [79, 80], we suppose that all the microscopic
particles were made up of a kind of elementary sinks of
tao. These elementary sinks were created simultaneously.
The initial masses and the strengthes of the elementary
sinks are the same. These elementary sinks were named
as monads.

Based on these two hypotheses, the equation of motion

of a particle is [2]

m(t)

=

m(t)u

dv
dt

ρtq0
m0(t)

ρtq0
m0(t)

−

m(t)v + F,

(45)

where ρt is density of the tao, the m0(t) is the mass of a
monad at time t,
q0 is the strength of a monad, m(t)
is the mass of a particle at time t, v is the velocity of
the particle, u is the velocity of the tao at the location of
the particle induced by all means other than the particle
itself, F denotes other forces.

It is shown that the forces between two particles is
coincide with Newton’s inverse-square-law of gravitation.
Eq.(45) shows that there exists an universal drag force

IV. A DERIVATION OF THE SCHR ¨ODINGER
EQUATION FROM NEWTON’S SECOND LAW
AND A CALCULATION OF THE PLANK
CONSTANT THEORETICALLY

The purpose of this section is to derive the Schr¨odinger
equation (1) from Newton’s second law without ignoring
the universal drag force and calculate the Plank constant
h theoretically.

In his derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation [14], Nel-
son thought that we cannot attribute any friction to the
aether, for then we could distinguish absolute rest from
uniform motion.

If Nelson’s stochastic mechanics is the correct direc-
tion of the stochastic interpretation of quantum mechan-
ics, then the next step in this direction is to explore the
origin of quantum ﬂuctuations. Therefore, the physical
cause of stochasticity is theoretically and experimentally
an fundamental problem in the stochastic interpretation
of quantum mechanics.

When a classical particle undergoes a macroscopic
Brownian motion in a viscous ﬂuid, there exists a dis-
sipative force exerted on the particle.

Since quantum theory shows that vacuum is not empty
and has physical eﬀects, e.g., the Casimir eﬀect, see
[81, 82, 83, 84], etc., it is natural to speculate that Nel-
son’s frictionless vacuum assumption may only be an ide-
alisation.

Untuh investigated the existence of a dissipative vac-

uum eﬀect in 1976 [85].

Luis de la Pe˜na and A. M. Cetto thought that dissipa-
tive forces are essential to restore the local equilibrium
in their study of Nelson’s equations [86].

Kaloyerou and Vigier [49] thought that Nelson’s fric-
tionless assumption may only be an approximate ideal-
isation and derived a frictional non-linear Schr¨odinger
equation Eq.(44) following the procedures of Nelson in
[14].

Namsrai proposed that the stochasticity in the micro-
scopic world is caused by the eﬀets due to stochastic
space-time, i.e., gravitation [25]. According to Namsrai,
this idea was ﬁrst considered by Einstein [25, 87].

We speculate that quantum phenomena may be caused
by the interactions between the particles and the ﬂuidic
tao ﬁlling the universe. If all the microscopic particles
are indeed undergoing some microscopic Brownian mo-
tions decribed by Nelson [14], Kaloyerou and Vigier [49],
etc. , then we need some rapidly ﬂuctuating and highly
irregular random forces exerted on each particle by the
tao. It is natural to speculate that the ﬂuidic tao ﬁlling
the universe may provide these random forces.

Now let us start out to derive the Schr¨odinger equation

Fd =

exerted on each particle by the tao.

from Newton’s second law.

(46)

Suppose a Brownian particle is moving in an exter-
nal force ﬁeld in the ﬂuid tao.
In order to described
the motion of the Brownian particle, let us introduce a

{

or

o, x, y, z

Cartesian coordinate system
o, x1, x2, x3}
which is attached to the static tao at the inﬁnity. Let x(t)
denote the position of the Brownian particle at time t.
We assume that the velocity v = dx/dt exists. Suppose
there is a drag force Fd and a random force Fr(t) exerted
on the Brownian particle. Then, according to Newton’s
second law, the motion of the Brownian particle may be
described by

or

From Hypothesis 1, the random force Fr(t) is the gen-
eralized derivative of a Wiener process N(t). We may
write formally

N(t) =

Fr(s)ds,

or Fr(t) =

−
Here N(t) is a three-dimensional Wiener process and

≡

(53)

where m is the mass of the particle.

Suppose the force F(x, t) exerted on the Brownian par-

ticle is a continuous function of x and t.

Suppose the frictional force Fd exerted on the Brow-
nian particle by the ﬂuid is determined by Eq.(46). For
convenience, we may introduce a notation of the drag
coeﬃcient f as

f =

ρtq0
m0

m.

(48)

Thus, we have Fd =

f v.

−

Next, we need a proper mathematical model of the
rapidly ﬂuctuating and highly irregular force Fr(t) to en-
sure that the Eq.(47) is mathematically explicit. Inspired
by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory of Brownian motion,
it is natural to speculate that the random force Fr(t)
exerted on a Brownian particle by the tao has the same
properties as the random force exerted on a Brownian
particle immersed in a classical ﬂuid by the ﬂuid. Notic-
ing Eq.(25) and Eq.(26), we may introduce the following
hypothesis

Hypothesis 1 Suppose the random force Fr(t) exerted
on a particle by the tao is a three-dimensional Gaussian
white noise. Suppose that the strength η2
i , ηi > 0 of the
ith component of Fr(t) has the following form

η2
i = 2f kBTt,

(49)

where f is the drag coeﬃcient of the drag force exerted
on the particle by the tao, kB is the Boltzmann constant,
Tt is the equilibrium temperature of the tao.

For convenience, we may introduce a notation as σ1 =

E[(Ni(t)

Ni(s))(Nj (t)

Nj(s))] = 2ν1δij (t

s), (54)

−

−

−

where Ni is the ith component of the three-dimensional
Wiener process N(t), ν1 > 0 is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of
N(t), δij is the Kronecher symbol, t

0.

s

Now based on Hypothesis 1 and using Eq.(48), the
mathematically rigorous form of Eqs.(47) is the following
stochastic diﬀerential equations

≥

dx(t) = v(t)dt,
mdv(t) =

(cid:26)

f v(t)dt + F(x, t)dt + dN(t).

(55)

Now we introduce the following deﬁnitions

β =

We see that B(t) is a three-dimensional Wiener process

m2 =

dx(t) = v(t)dt,
dv(t) =

−

βv(t)dt + K(x, t)dt + dB(t).

Further, we introduce the following deﬁnitions

b(x, t) =

dx(t) = v(t)dt,
dv(t) =

−

βv(t)dt + βb(x, t)dt + βdw(t).

Let x(t) be the solution of Eqs.(62-63) with x(0) =
x0, v(0) = x0. In orde to apply Nelson’s Theoerom 10.1
in [15], we may suppose that the functions b(x, t) : R3
→
R3 satisfy a global Lipschitz condition. Now according
to Nelson’s Theoerom 10.1 in [15], for a time scale of a

7

observer very large compare to the relaxation time 1/β,
x(t) converges to the solution y(t) of the Smoluchowski
equation

dy(t) = b(y, t)dt + dw(t)

(64)

From Eq.(70), we have

G =

4πk2

BT 2

or, G =

with y(0) = x0.

Noticing Eq.(48) and Eq.(61), we have

ν3 =

.

Now we may introduce the following deﬁnitions

h =

4πm0kBTt

or, ~ =

=

2m0kBTt

The value of h may be determined by experiments.

From the Eq.(66), we have

or ν3 =

~

h

.

We see that Eq.(67) is coincides with Nelson’s hypoth-

esis (36).

Now based on Eq.(64) and Eq.(67) and following the
same procedures of Nelson in [14], we will arrive the
Schr¨odinger equation (1). Thus, we have completed the
derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation (1).

V. TIME DEPENDENCE OF THE PLANK
CONSTANT h

From the results in [2], we see that the mass m0 of
a monad is increasing since q0 evaluates the volume of
the tao entering the monad per unit time. Therefore,
from Eq.(66), we see that the Plank constant h is time
dependent.

VI. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT G AND THE
PLANK CONSTANT h

From the results in [2], the gravitational constant G

can be written as

G =

ρtq2
0
4πm2
0(t)

,

VII. CONCLUSION

(65)

(66)

We speculate that quantum phenomena may origi-
nated from the stochastic motions of the particles im-
mersed in a ﬂuid ﬁlling the universe which may be called
aether or tao. Based on a hypothesis about the ran-
dom forces exerted on the particles by the tao, we show
that Nelson’s hypothesis on the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of
quantum particles arrived naturally. Following the same
method of Nelson’s stochastic mechanics, we show that
the Schr¨odinger equation can be derived from Newton’s
second law. As a byproduct, the Plank constant h is cal-
culated theoretically. It is shown that the Plank constant
h is time dependent. We also get a relationship between
the gravitational constant G and the Plank constant h.

VIII. DISCUSSION

There exists some interesting theoretical, experimen-
tal and applied problems in the ﬁelds of stochastic me-
chanics, quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynam-
ics, stochastic electrodynamics, quantum ﬁeld theory
and other related ﬁelds involving this theory of non-
relativistic quantum phenomena.

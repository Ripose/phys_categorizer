Abstract

Prospects of parametric x-rays (PXR) application for the development of a tuneable quasi-
monochromatic x-ray source for medical imaging are discussed. Analysis of basic requirements
for electron accelerator shows that it must be relatively low-energy and high-current linac.
In
comparison with known ultra-relativistic cases, at low energies PXR properties will be modiﬁed
to a great extent by multiple scattering of the electrons. PXR intensity dependence on target
thickness and beam energy are calculated taking multiple scattering into account. It is concluded
that PXR source based on real medical accelerators is feasible and can provide x-ray ﬂux needful
for obtaining high quality medical images.

Introduction

Parametric x-rays (PXR) produced by a relativistic charged particle uniformly moving through
a single crystal were declared as a very attractive radiation mechanism for x-ray source since its
theoretical prediction in 1972 [1] - [3] and ﬁrst experimental observation in 1985 [4]. Actually, it has
a number of indisputable features, namely, high monochromaticity, energy tuneability, polarization,
directivity, and possibility to be emitted to large angles relative to beam direction, i.e. provide
monochromatic x-rays virtually free of background. PXR properties were studied at a number of
accelerator facilities worldwide but a PXR-based x-ray source developments are still in progress.

Evidently, this is connected with the fact that PXR research is performed at existing linear and
annular accelerators and limited by their technical speciﬁcations. So, we should recognize how to
design a pxr-based source that will meet the consumer’s requirements for its use in industry and
medicine.

Industry and science, as consumers, essentially yield to medicine, which represents the huge mar-
ket for devices and methods for x-ray diagnostics. Statistically, x-ray devices count for about 60%
of medical diagnostics devices [5]. Despite the development of alternative diagnostics methods, e.g.
ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, the number of studies in the ﬁeld of x-ray diagnostics
remains high. First of all, medicine demands decreased irradiation doses taken together with increased
resolution and contrast. These requirements can be met if the customer will be oﬀered a monochro-
matic tuneable source, providing x-radiation with exactly the energy required for examination of a
speciﬁc organ. For example, in mammography the maximum spectral density lies in the range of
17-20 keV; in radiography of the chest, extremities and head, the range of 40-50 keV is optimal; while
the 50-70 keV range is used for abdomen and pelvis radiography. Precise selection of monochromatic
radiation energy will allow a reduction of a patient dose of tens times, even in comparison with digital

radiography and computer tomography, with improvement of x-ray image quality. However, in com-
parison with scientiﬁc and industrial applications where signal accumulation is possible, in the case of
medicine the source should emit number of quanta suﬃcient to provide necessary contrast of an image
at the speciﬁc value of the signal-to-noise ratio. Estimations [6, 7] give minimal value of x-ray quanta
necessary for high-quality image equal to ∼107 photons/mm2. PXR quantum yield in a thin crystal
target even at high enough (e.g. 900 MeV) beam energy is not very large and amounts only ∼10−5-
10−6 photons/e−·sr [8]. Assuming the target to be imaged is 30 cm diameter at one meter distance
from a source, it is necessary to apply ∼ 0.1 A current to get a required x-ray ﬂux. Such currents can
be achieved only in low energy accelerators. Though theoretically PXR may be emitted at any energy
of charged particles [9], there is a factor limiting the minimal value of beam energy for source under
discussion. Assuming x-ray energy necessary for subtractive coronary angiography ̟B=33 keV then
the angle of radiation θB in a diamond target will come to ∼ 4◦ for (111) reﬂex and ∼ 7◦ for (220)
reﬂex that it is enough for arrangement of a patient at 1-2 meter distance from the target. Now let us

uations for PXR source based on low-energy electron beam, we should look into multiple scattering
(MS) of electrons more precisely, because MS appeared to be the most signiﬁcant factor aﬀecting PXR
intensity and angular distribution at relatively low energies and/or thick targets [8]. In low energy
cases we shouldn’t use kinematics formulae [10], where MS is considered phenomenologically. Let us
describe the multiple scattering inﬂuence on x-ray reﬂex characteristics in more detail following [11].

2 Calculation of x-radiation properties in the multiple scattering

To get an expression for spectral-angular density of radiation with MS account, it is necessary to
average the squared modulus of all possible particle trajectories in a crystal in the following expression

The obtained expression will describe all mechanisms of the radiation: PXR, Bremsstrahlung, and
transition radiation in a single manner. The velocity vector is presented in the form: ~v = ~v0cosθ + v0~θ
(where ~v0 determines the direction of the initial velocity of a charged particle, θ ≡
is the the angle
of multiple scattering of a particle (θ << 1), ~θ is the two-dimensional vector, ~θ⊥~v0 and ~θ = 0 at t ≤ 0).
Averaging is followed [13], where the procedure was performed with the help of dispersion function,
satisfying the Fokker-Planck kinetic equation in the amorphous medium. Averaging of the right part
of the equation (1) was performed and the integral expressions for spectral-angular distributions of
the radiation, taking into account multiple scattering for the lateral and forward PXR maxima were
derived.

There are two factors limiting the longitudinal size of quasi-Cherenkov radiation formation area:
MS of charged particles on atoms of substance and x-ray absorption in the medium. As in case
of radiation generation in an amorphous medium, the PXR characteristics essentially depend on
the relation between crystal thickness along the direction of the charged particle movement L0 and
Bremsstrahlung coherent length LBr. The theory of PXR with the phenomenological account of MS

with experimental results only at crystal thickness L0 << LBr. In this case MS inﬂuence appears only
as a small addition in the intensity of generated x-ray caused by Bremsstrahlung. Also MS inﬂuence
on PXR phase is taken into account and interference between PXR and Bremsstrahlung is neglected.
In the inverse case MS essentially changes the parameters of the PXR itself.

3 PXR characteristics dependence on crystal target thickness

To demonstrate MS eﬀect on PXR characteristics, numerical calculations were performed for fol-

lowing conditions: target Si (220) in Laue geometry, 2θB = 19◦, electron beam energy 900 MeV.
PXR spectral-angular density as a function of crystal target thickness is shown in Fig.1.
It is
evident, that already at L0 ∼ LBr presence of MS results in PXR intensity distinctly less than
intensity determined without MS account. During further increase of the crystal thickness, spectral-
angular density achieves saturation at thickness of ∼ (2 ÷ 3)LBr and then goes down. It is seen from
this ﬁgure that PXR spectral-angular density without MS (curve 1) continues to grow with crystal
thickness increase even up to ∼ 10LBr. The tendency shows that absorption still does not plays an
essential role though L0 becomes of the order of Labs. Simultaneously with the variation of PXR
spectral-angular density with crystal thickness increase, change of its spectral width appears (see

Figure 2: Dependence of PXR frequency half-width on crystal thickness, counted along a direction of
charged particle movement in units of LBr: 1 - without MS account, 2 - with MS account

Fig.2).

As long as the thickness of the crystal target does not exceed 0.5LBr, spectral-angular density
and spectral width of PXR reﬂex determined with MS account practically coincide with the values
received without MS consideration. At the same time, spectral width of PXR peak decreases with L0
increase. The width of PXR maximum is inversely proportional to radiation coherent length. As the
target thickness increase (on thickness of ∼ LBr and larger) PXR coherent length begins to be limited
by LBr. So, PXR peak width without MS continues to decrease with L0 growth, but MS account
results in stabilization of peak width at L0 ∼ LBr (Fig.2).

Thus, calculation results, demonstrated in the Figures 1 and 2, show that MS of a charged particle
results not only in radiation phase shift, but also in essential decrease of PXR spectral-angular density
at angles of ϑ ∼ ϑph as well as in change of reﬂex width, even in case of L0 ∼ LBr.

As a result of joint processes of PXR spectral narrowing and spectral-angular density decrease,
PXR integral characteristics do not vary essentially. As an example, in Fig.3 there are given depen-
dence of PXR angular distributions (at ϑ = 1.66 · 10−3rad) on the crystal thickness without MS (1)
and in the MS presence (2). One can see that for the target thickness L0 = 10LBr the maximal value
of spectral-angular distribution (at ϑ = 1.66·10−3 rad) calculated without MS account exceeds the the
maximal value obtained with MS account more than two orders of magnitude (compare with Fig.1),
while amplitudes of angular distributions (for the same angle) diﬀer less than by one order (Fig.3). MS
also results in PXR angular distribution spreading, therefore if the angular aperture of a detector is
big enough (θD >> ϑph), the diﬀerence in results for integrated number of the quanta calculated with
the MS account and without taking it into account will be even less, than for angular distributions.
Thus, the most signiﬁcant diﬀerence of the results obtained with and without MS account is observed
for diﬀerential distributions.

4 PXR intensity dependence on charged particle energy

As well as for Cherenkov radiation in homogeneous media, PXR spectral-angular density has thresh-
old behavior. However, due to essential dispersion of a crystal refraction index, dependence of integral

Therefore, by ﬁxing the thickness of a crystal target and changing the energy of charged particles
(thus changing LBr), it is possible to calculate dependences of spectral-angular density and angular
distribution, and dependence of spectral maximum width on the L0/LBr ratio (similar to shown in
Fig.1 - Fig.3). Certainly, the nature of these dependences is completely diﬀerent. A change of a crystal
target thickness results in the change of a trajectory length where particle radiates coherently. In fact,
this is its cut-oﬀ because the PXR coherent length is equal to inﬁnity. Besides, on particle energy
decrease the PXR generation is realized at increasing values of |αB| (detuning parameter from the
exact value of the Bragg angle) that in turn results in decrease of radiation intensity.

PXR spectral-angular distributions calculated for the same geometry as Fig.1 and Fig.2 were

plotted in Fig.4.

Crystal thickness was chosen equal to 0.01 cm and polar angle of radiation was ϑ=1.8 mrad.
It is evident from Fig.4, which for 9 GeV electron beam energy distributions calculated without
(curve 3) and with MS account (curve 4), practically coincides. In this case LBr = 1.22 × 10−1cm, i.e.
L0 << LBr, so a situation of weak MS is realized here. Change of energy from 9 GeV down to 900 MeV

yields in change of Bremsstrahlung coherent length to the order of magnitude, LBr = 1.22 × 10−2cm.
In this case target thickness along direction of charged particle movement L0 becomes of one order
with LBr. Presence of MS results in essential decrease of height and spreading of PXR peak (curve
2) in comparison with the calculations, without taking MS into account (curve 1).

The spectrum corresponding to 900 MeV appeared shifted down for ∆ω ∼ 5 × 10−6ωB along
frequency axis relative to spectrum corresponding to 9 GeV. In the same time, shift of curve 2 relative
to curve 1 as a result of MS inﬂuence for 900 MeV appeared to be just 10−7ωB.

Amplitudes of spectral-angular distributions without MS (curves 1 and 3) has decreased less than
1.5 times, while MS account decrease it more than four times with energy decrease from 9 GeV down
to 900 MeV. Comparing spectral-angular distributions for 900 MeV energy, it is possible to see that
MS account results in decrease of height of spectral-angular distribution approximately 3.2 times and
its spreading is ∼2.5 times. Thus, MS presence results in decrease of PXR angular intensity.

PXR angular distributions with MS account for the geometry described above in a crystal with
thickness of 0.13 cm are plotted in Fig.5 Detector resolution was considered equal to ∆̟/̟B = 10−3.
It is evident from the ﬁgure that energy decrease to three times (from 900 down to 300 MeV) results
in a decrease of maximum intensity almost ﬁve times. At the same time there is a shift of angular
distribution maximum to the bigger angles from 2.9 mrad up to 4.8 mrad and spreading almost to one
and half times more. Thus MS presence results in noticeable decrease of angular intensity, angular
distribution spreading and to a shift of maximum in angular distribution towards the bigger angles
in comparison with calculations without MS account. For example, for 300 MeV electron energy the
maximum in PXR angular distribution without MS account is achieved at 2.3 mrad angle.

Study of radiation yield energy dependence is important for correct understanding of the PXR
generation mechanism. This dependence, as mentioned above, has a threshold nature and its speciﬁc
shape at experimental measurement in many respects is determined by the angular size of the detector.

Results of PXR quantum yield calculations for electron energy in a range from 300 up to 900 MeV
are plotted in Fig.6; angular aperture of detector is 9.5·10−3 rad. The angular aperture of detector is
θD > ϑph even for 300 MeV, that is why the detector collects practically all generated radiation and
we have behaviour of quantum yield energy dependence that is “natural” for proper PXR.

Presence of MS results in a steep decrease of PXR quantum yield. For example, for 700 MeV
electron energy PXR quantum yield without MS exceeds the result received with MS consideration
by up to 1.5 times, for 300 MeV this value already amounts ∼2.9 times.

5 Conclusion

Summing up, multiple scattering of charged particles in a crystal target changes considerably the
characteristics of x-rays originating due to a particle passage through a single crystal. MS eﬀect is
bigger at low energies and/or thick targets and demonstrates itself in x-rays distributions spread-
ing, monochromaticity, and quantum yield decrease. Nevertheless, PXR at low energies can provide
monochromaticity of 10−3-10−2 which is still applicable in medical imaging.

Using the approach described above, let us estimate the characteristics of PXR source, which can
be produced on real medical accelerators [14]. As a rule, maximal energy of electron beam in these
accelerators is equal 20-28 MeV. We have evaluated angular density of radiation for next conditions:
Ee= 25 MeV, 33 keV x-rays, symmetrical Laue case for (111), (220), and (400). Silicon target of
L=0.01 cm was chosen which is somewhat bigger, but more real than optimal for these conditions
(about (1÷10)LBr, i.e. ∼ 3 ÷ 30 microns) target thickness. Angles between electron velocity direction
and direction to diﬀraction reﬂex are ∼6.9, 11.2, and 15.9 degrees, respectively. Angular densities for
discussed cases are plotted in Fig.7.

Integration on angular density gives us total amount of x-ray quanta on 20 × 20 cm area located
at 1.5 m distance from the target. Appropriate amounts appeared equal to ∼ 3 · 10−6, ∼ 5 · 10−7, and
∼ 1 · 10−7 photons/e− for (111), (220), and (400) reﬂexes, respectively. It is evident, that despite a
decrease of radiation quantum yield at low energies, the integral amount of quanta do not decrease
very drastically and the number of x-ray quanta needful for quality image can still be achieved at

7

0.1-0.2 A beam current.

However, to provide some margin of safety for PXR application for a medical x-ray source, it is
necessary to ﬁnd opportunities to increase its radiation yield. Let us consider some variants of radiation
yield increase. One of the ways to increase x-rays spectral-angular density may be the generation of
radiation in a multi-wave mode, in other words, when PXR emission goes simultaneously on several
systems of the crystallographic planes.
In [15, 16] measurements of angular distributions of PXR
generated in a GaAs crystal by relativistic electrons with energies 500 and 900 MeV were reported.
In these experiments the anomalies (i.e. signiﬁcant intensity increase in narrow angular range), which
cannot be explained by the PXR two-wave theory [10], were observed. The analysis of geometry
has shown that conditions of multi-wave diﬀraction were realized for emitted photons. Thorough
theoretical description for experiments [15, 16] was performed in [17]. In [18] demonstration of multi-
wave eﬀects in low-energy range was numerically analysed for PXR generated by 7 MeV electrons in
conditions of eight-wave diﬀraction. Calculations have shown that, despite of strong MS of electrons
at low energies, multi-wave eﬀects may appear in PXR angular distribution and also result in the
formation of a strong narrow peak in the centre of two-wave angular distribution.

Next a rather promising way for radiation spectral-angular density increase is the application of
stratiﬁed (multi-layered) crystal targets [19]. PXR intensity increases up to 7-8 times in 10-layer target
made of relatively thin silicon crystal foils in comparison with monolithic target of equivalent thickness
have been reported in the paper. At last, targets made of mosaic crystals should be mentioned (for
example, [20]). They also can provide an increase in the intensity of x-rays.

Research of the behaviour of sophisticated targets at low energies, preferably at conditions that
can provide existing medical accelerators, and determination of their optimal characteristics in this
range, may lead to a practical design for a real medical monochromatic x-ray source. At the end,
our results were obtained for Laue geometry, but for Bragg geometry MS inﬂuence can be somewhat
weaker. Bragg geometry of PXR radiation can also provide more intensive x-ray yield. It is intended
to be a subject of our further research.

Authors are very grateful to Dr. O. Missevich for fruitful discussions on x-ray imaging issues.

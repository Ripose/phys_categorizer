may imply the existence of a matter wave.

1. Dirac theory:

To describe the motion of a free electron, Dirac (Dirac 1958) introduced (α1α2α3β)

or equivalently (γµ, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4) (Bathe 1986)into the theory. The γ′s are indepen-

dent of the x′

µs and the p′s, where x and p are the sapce-time coordinates and the
momentum-energy of the particle. Dirac pointed out that the γ′s describe some new

degree of freedom, belonging to some internal motion in the electron, so that they

must commute with the x′s and the p′s. The basis state vector is represented by two

seperated pieces of components, a space-time part (xµ) and a spin part which is a com-

plex spinor. In this theory, the quantity jµ = ¯Ψγµψ is a Lorentz 4-vector. Since the

γ′s are independent of the x′s and the p′s, so jµ is also independent of the x′s and p′s.

In mechanics, the inﬁnitesmal generators for the x′s are the dynamical conjugete

variables p′s, and for rotational angular displacements θ′

is the angular momentum.

The inﬁnitesmal unitary transformation in spin space can be written as

U = 1 +

σi · ξi,

where the σ′s are the Pauli matrices and the ξ′s the analogue quantities of the θ′

spin-space. The relations between the σ′s and the γ′s are given as (Bethe 1986)

where ρ1 is given in (Dirac 1958). The γ′s are linear combinations of the σ′

have (η1η2η3) as the analogue of (θ1θ2θ3) plus a 4th-component η4. The θ′s are in

the spin-space so they are independent of the x′s and the p′s, therefore η1, η2 and η3

are also independent of the x′s and the p′s. It is reasonable to assume that η4 is also

independent of the x′s and the p′s since the γ′s describe some new dagree of freedom

which are internal in the particle, their dynamical conjugate variables should also be

related to variables which are internal.

Now, we can see clearly that the basis state vector of the particle is 8-dimensional.

However, nature should prefer simple and symmetry. Instead of having two seperated

parts of basis space, we should rather have one whole complete piece of continuous

basis space. That is, it is natural to suggest a complex 4-dimensional space-time

manifold.

The above conerideration is based only on the dimensionality of Dirac theory and

does not depend on the content of the theory. In fact, we can use Schr¨odinger-Pauli

equation (Dirac 1958) where the basic variables are (xyztσ1σ2σ3), where the σ′s oper-

ate on the spin-space. The inﬁnitesmal unitary transformation in spin space has the

form as equation (1) and thus we have three conjugated variables similar to (ξ1ξ2ξ3).

Now, if we wish the theory to be Lorentz convariant, we have to generalize the three

σ′s to a 4-component quantity which is similar to the γ′s. Therefore we again have

four more variables besides (xyzt).

2. Matter wave: Consider a complex 4-dimensional space-time manifold, to de-

3

scribe the motion of a free particle, there must exist a well-behaved function Ψ(T =

t + i¯t, X = x + i¯x) which is continuous and diﬀeratiable in the domain under consid-

eration. The simplest form of such a function can be written as

Ψ(T ) and Ψ(X) must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions (Churchill 1948) for an

analytic function. Write Ψ(X) as

Ψ(X) = u(x, ¯x) + iv(x, ¯x).

Since Ψ(X) is analytic in some region of the X plane, we have

Then we can also write

c1

∂2u
∂x2 +

∂2u
∂ ¯x2 !

 

+ c2

∂2v
∂x2 +

∂2v
∂ ¯x2 !

 

= 0,

where c1 and c2 are constants. Assume that nature does not have special preference

between real and imaginery parts except the i. Take c1 = 1 and c2 = i, we get

Ψ = Ψ(T ) · Ψ(X),

T = t + i¯t,

X = x + i¯x.

∂ ¯x2 = 0.

Since x and ¯x are basically independent, we must be able to describe the x-part and

the ¯x-part of the function seperately. That is, we have Ψ(x, i¯x) = Ψ(x)Ψ(i¯x). Then

the solution of equation (9) has the form

Ψ(X) = Ae±ax · e±b¯x,

a2 + b2 = 0.

(10)

where A, a and b are constants. We take Ψ(X) = Ae±ikX = Ae±ik(x+i¯x). Such that Ψ

is analytic.

Similarly we ﬁnd Ψ(T ) to be e±iωT , therefore we have

Ψ(X, T ) = Ae±i(kX−ωt).

(11)

With respect to our direct experimental meaurements, we can take only real space-

time variables. The projection of Ψ(X, T ) onto the real space-time region gives us

Ψ(x, t) = Aei(kx−ωt), the constants k and ω are identiﬁed as the wave number and

angular frequency. Up to this point, we can see that the free particle we wish to

describe is a free wave. This may oﬀer a possible solution to the question that why a

particle has to be a wave as well.

Finally, if the space-time is complex, there may have a possibility that those phys-

ically undetectable particles may stay in the imaginery part of the nature.

The author wishes to express his appreciation to Professors E. Yen J.C. Shaw,

J.C. Lee, B. Rosenstein, C.S. Han, T.H. Kou, C.S. Chu and W.D. Nee for valuable

discussions.

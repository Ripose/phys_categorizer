Einstein’s theory of wavefronts versus
Einstein’s relativity of simultaneity

Abstract

The relativity of simultaneity implies that the Lorentz transformed (LT) image of a spherical (circu-
lar) wavefront is not a spherical (circular) wavefront (Einstein 1905) but an ellipsoidal (elliptical) wavefront
[Moreau W.]. We show ﬁrst that the relativity of simultaneity leads to the consequence that the image of a
Lorentz transformed plane wavefront is a tangent plane to an ellipsoid and not a tangent plane to a sphere
(Einstein 1905). We then deduce a longitudinal component of the tangent vector to Poincar´e’s ellipse which
is directly connected to the relativity of simultaneity. We suggest ﬁnally that this violation of simultaneity is
related to Einstein’s implicit choice of the (non relativistic) transverse gauge.

1 Relativity of simultaneity (LT) and Elliptical wavefront

Let us consider two inertial systems K and K’ in uniform translation relative to one another. A source of light
is at rest O in K. What is the image by a LT in K’ in t0, to a circular wavefront in K, emitted at t′ = t = 0 by
this source S? Let us write the LT with perfectly spacetime symmetry (in x and t) [Poincar´e H. 1905]:

x′ = γ(x + βt)

y′ = y

t′ = γ(t + βx)

Let us consider the relativistic invariant:

x2 + y2 = r2

0 = t2
0

x′2 + y

′2 = r′2 = t′2

The object time t = t0 is ﬁxed in K (circular wavefront in K) but the image time t’ is not ﬁxed (by the LT)

in K’. We obtain using (1) t′ = γ−1t0 + βx′:

x′2 + y

′2 = (γ−1t0 + βx′)2

or

(γ−1x′ − βt0)2 + y′2 = t2
0

which is the Cartesian equation of an elongated ellipse in K’ with the observer O’ at the focus, ﬁgure 1):

The physical meaning of this elliptical spacetime wavefront is the relativity of simultaneity: two simulta-

neous events (diﬀerent abscissa) in K are not simultaneous in K’ [Pierseaux Y (2004)] :

∆t = 0

∆t′ =

t′+ − t′−

∆t′ is ”the simultaneity gap” between two opposite events on the front (ﬁgure 1). If according to Einstein
[Einstein A.(1905), paragraphe 3], the object (ﬁxed time t) and the image (ﬁxed time t’), are both spherical
(circular)1, then two simultaneous events in K must be always also simultaneous in K’:

(∆t′ = 0)Einstein
(5)
1Einstein writes :” At the time t = τ = 0, when the origin of the two coordinates (K and k) is common to the two systems, let a
spherical wave be emitted therefrom, and be propagated -with the velocity c in system K. If x, y, z be a point just attained by this
wave, then x2 + y2 + z2 = c2t2. Transforming this equation with our equations of transformation (see Einstein’s LT, 29), we obtain
after a simple calculation ξ2 + η2 + ζ 2 = c2τ 2. The wave under consideration is therefore no less a spherical wave with velocity of
propagation c when viewed in the moving system k.”[Einstein A.(1905)]

In polar coordinates (x′ = r′ cos θ′, y′ = r′ sin θ′,with θ′ as polar angle and F as pole) the equation of the elongated
ellipse is :

With relativistic transformation of angle [Moreau W.]

r′ =

r0
γ(1 − β cos θ′)

cos θ′ =

cos θ + β
1 + β cos θ

We rediscover the LT for any point of the wavefront (r, θ or t, θ) :

r′ = γr0(1 + β cos θ)

t′ = γt0(1 + β cos θ)

The velocity of light (”one way”) is identical in all directions within both systems because we have by
construction ﬁgure 1): r0
t′− = c = 1. What is a wavefront in a relativistic sense or in other words a
t0
”spacetime” wavefront? The invariant interval between the event ”emission” (t = t′ = 0) and any event on the
t′, r′ in K’) is null within both systems. So Minkowski’s null spacetime
wavefront (t = t0, r = r0 in K and
4-vector is, from Poincar´e’s point of view2, a wavefront 4-vector. The elliptical image by a LT is deduced from a
non-transversal

t′ section in Minkowski’s cone.

t′+ = r′−

= r′+

According to Einstein, the image of a space wavefront (t is ﬁxed) is a space wavefront (t’ is ﬁxed). We will

see now that is exactly the same for Einstein’s plane wavefront [Einstein A.(1905), paragraphe 7].

2 Relativity of simultaneity (LT) and the tangent plane wavefront

to the ellipsoid

Until now we considered only one source SO which emits at t = t′ = 0 a spherical wave at ﬁxed time t = t0
(ﬁgure 1)- Let us now consider a second source S∞ at inﬁnity at rest in K in the direction θ (ﬁgure 2) which
emits a plane wavefront. Suppose that the considered plane wavefront (here a ”wave straight line” at two space
dimensions) be in O at the time t = t′ = 0 (when SO emits a spherical wave). It will be tangent in t = t0 to
the circular wavefront, emitted by S1 (normalized t0 = r0 = 1 ﬁgure 2). We note that the simultaneous events
1T ′P ′
P1T P2 in K are no longer simultaneous (P ′
2) in K’. We deduce respectively (1) for the object front (”wave
straight line” with angular coeﬃcient a = − cot θ) and the image front thefollowing relations:

x cos θ + y sin θ = t0

y′ sin θ′ + x′ cos θ′ = t′

And exactly as in the circular wavefronts case (2), there are two possibilities:
If t′

is not ﬁxed (Poincar´e, spacetime image wavefront), we have by a LT, t′ = γ(t + βx) = γ−1t + βx′,
and therefore the primed equation (9) is the equation of the tangent to the ellipse at the point T ′ (on which P ′
1
and P ′

2 are situated) :

The angular coeﬃcient of Poincar´e’s wavefront:

y′ sin θ′ + x′(cos θ′ − β) = γ−1t

poincar´e = tgα′ =
a′

β − cos θ′
sin θ′

If t′ is ﬁxed (Einstein, space image wavefront3) the primed equation (9) is the equation of the tangent

to the circle (with centre O’ and radius r′

T ). The angular coeﬃcient of Einstein’s wavefront is:

einstein = − cot θ′
a′
(12)
2Poincar´e ﬁrst introduced [Poincar´e H.(1908)] the ellipsoidal image of a spherical wavefront. However Poincar´e’s historical ellipse
(source at the focus) is not equation (6). It is given by the inverse LT by changing (in 6) the sign of the velocity and by inverting
prime and non primed.

3Einstein deﬁned clearly the image of the wavefront in paragraph 7 of his 1905 paper: ”If we call the angle θ′

the angle between

the wave-normal (direction of the ray) and the direction of movement”.

This is a Galilean invariant (t is ﬁxed on the object front and t’ is ﬁxed on the image front) in the sense

that the angle (ﬁgure 2) φ = φ′ = 90◦ is not altered by a Galilean transformation (GT).

properties of the ellipse:

4 Conclusion

Einstein’s theory of (spherical and plane) wavefronts is not compatible with Einstein’s relativity of simultaneity.
Einstein’s wavefronts are ”rigid” in a prerelativistic meaning: a set of simultaneous events is transformed into
a set of simultaneous events. But this unexpected internal contradiction has possibly no physical consequence.
Indeed we showed that only the electromagnetic potential (which is 4-vector written for the ﬁrst time by
Poincar´e in 1905), and not the electromagnetic ﬁeld, is sensitive to this violation of relativity of simultaneity.
We showed [Pierseaux Y. (2005-2)][Pierseaux Y & Rousseaux G.] that Einstein’s theory of wavefronts is based
on the transverse gauge (completed Coulomb gauge) whilst Poincar´e’s theory of spacetime wavefronts is based
upon the Lorenz gauge. The implicit Einstein’s choice[Einstein A.(1905), paragraph 7] of the completed Coulomb
gauge (transverse gauge) explains the reason why the relativity of simultaneity is violated.

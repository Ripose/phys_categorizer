We speculate that the universe may be ﬁlled with a visco-elastic continuum which may be called
aether. Thus, Maxwell’s equations in vacuum are derived by methods of continuum mechanics based
on a continuum mechanical model of vacuum and a singularity model of electric charges.

INTRODUCTION

The Maxwell’s equations in vacuum can be written

as[1]

where E is electric ﬁeld vector, B is magnetic induc-
tion vector, ρe is the density ﬁeld of electric charges, ǫ0 is
the dielectric constant of vacuum, µ0 is magnetic perme-
ability of vacuum, t is time, ∇ is the Hamilton operator.
The main purpose of this paper is to derive the above
mentioned Maxwell’s equations in vacuum based on a
continuum mechanics model of vacuum and a singularity
model of electric charges.

The motive of this paper is to seek a mechanism of
electromagnetic phenomena. The reasons why new me-
chanical models of electromagnetic ﬁeld are interesting
may be summarized as follows.

Firstly, there exists some electromagnetic phenomena
that could not be interpreted by the present theories of
electromagnetic ﬁeld, e.g., the spin of electron [1, 2], the
Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect[3, 4]. New theories of of electro-
magnetic ﬁeld may view these problems from new angles.
Secondly, there exists some inconsistencies and inner
diﬃculties in the conventional classical electrodynamics,
e.g., the inadequacy of Li´eenard-Wiechert potentials [5,
6, 7]. New theories of electromagnetic phenomena may
overcome such diﬃculties.

Thirdly, there exists some divergence problems in
quantum electrodynamics[8]. In Dirac’s words, ’I must
say that I am very dissatisﬁed with the situation, be-
cause this so-called good theory does involve neglecting
inﬁnities which appear in its equations, neglecting them
in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathemat-
ics.’ New theories of electromagnetic phenomena may
open new ways to solve this problem.

Fourthly, since quantum theory shows that vacuum
is not empty and has physical eﬀects, e.g., the Casimir
eﬀect[9, 10, 11, 12], it is valuable to reexamine the old
concept of electromagnetic aether.

Fifthly, since quantum theory shows that vacuum is
not empty and has physical eﬀects, e.g., the Casimir
eﬀect[9, 10, 11, 12], it is valuable to reexamine the old
concept of electromagnetic aether.

Fifthly, from the point view of reductionism, Maxwell’s
theory of electromagnetic ﬁeld can be regarded as only a
phenomenological theory. Although Maxwell’s theory is
a ﬁeld theory, the concept of ﬁeld is diﬀerent from that of
continuum mechanics[13, 14, 15] because of the absence
of a continuum. Thus, from the point view of reduc-
tionism, the mechanism of electromagnetic phenomena
remains an unsolved problem in physics [16].

Sixthly, one of the great puzzles in physics is the prob-
lem of dark matter and dark energy[17]. New theories of
electromagnetic phenomena may provide new ideals to
attack this problem[18, 19].

Finally, one of the most important tasks of physics is
the uniﬁcation of the four fundamental interactions in the
universe. New theories of electromagnetic phenomena
may shed some light on this puzzle.

To conclude, it seems that new considerations on elec-
tromagnetic phenomena is needed. It is worthy keeping
an open mind with respect to all the theories of elec-
tromagnetic phenomena before the above problems been
solved.

Now let us brieﬂy review the long history of mechanical
interpretations of electromagnetic phenomena. Descartes
was the ﬁrst to bring the aether concept into science by
suggesting that it has mechanical properties according
to E. T. Whittaker[16]. He believed that every physical
phenomenon could be interpreted in the construction of
a mechanical model of the universe.

William Watson and Benjamin Franklin introduced the
one-ﬂuid theory of electricity independently in 1746 [16].
Henry Cavendish attempted to explain some of the
principal phenomena of electricity by means of an elastic
ﬂuid in 1771[16].

Not contented with the above mentioned one-ﬂuid the-
ory of electricity, du Fay, Robert Symmer and C. A.

1

Coulomb developed a two-ﬂuid theory of electricity from
1733 to 1789 [16].

Before the uniﬁcation of electromagnetic phenomena
and light phenomena by Maxwell in 1860s, light phenom-
ena were also studied independently based on Descartes’
scientiﬁc research program of the mechanical theory of
nature.

John Bernoulli introduced a ﬂuid aether theory of light

in 1752[16].

Euler believed that all electrical phenomena is caused
by the same aether that propagates light. Furthermore,
Euler attempted to explain gravity in terms of his single
ﬂuid aether[16].

After the advent of the successful transverse wave the-
ory of light of A. J. Frensnel, those imponderable ﬂuid
theories were abandoned. Frensnel’s dynamical theory of
a luminiferous aether had an important inﬂuence on the
scientiﬁc research program of the mechanical theory of
nature in the nineteenth century [16].

Inspired by Frensnel’s luminiferous aether theory, nu-
merous dynamical theories of elastic solid aether were es-
tablished by Stokes, Cauchy, Green, MacCullagh, Boussi-
nesq, Riemann and William Thomson [16].

Thomson’s analogies between electrical phenomena
and elasticity helped to inspire young James Clark
Maxwell [16]. Strongly impressed by Faraday’s theory
of lines of forces, Maxwell compared the Faraday’s lines
of forces with the lines of ﬂow of a ﬂuid. In 1861, in order
to obtain a mechanical interpretation of electromagnetic
phenomena, Maxwell established a mechanical model of
a magneto-electric medium. Maxwell’s magneto-electric
looks like a honeycomb.
medium is a cellular aether,
Each cell of the aether consists of a molecular vortex
surrounded by a layer of idle-wheel particles.
In a re-
markable paper published in 1864, Maxwell established
a group of equations which were named after his name
later.

In 1878, G. F. FitzGerald compared the magnetic force
and the velocity in a quasi-elastic solid of the type ﬁrst
suggested by MacCullagh [16]. FitzGerald’s mechanical
model of the electromagnetic aether were studied by A.
Sommerfeld, by R. Reiﬀ and by Sir J. Larmor later [16].
Because of some dissatisfactions with the mechanical
models of the electromagnetic aether and the success
of the theory of electromagnetic ﬁeld, the mechanical
world view was replaced by the electromagnetic world
view gradually. Therefore, the concepts of a luminif-
erous aether and an elastic solid aether were replaced
by the concepts of a electromagnetic aether or the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. This paradigm shift in scientiﬁc re-
search was attributed to many scientists, including Fara-
day, Maxwell, Sir J. Larmor, H. A. Lorentz, J. J. Thom-
son, H. R. Hertz, Ludwig Lorenz, Emil Wiechert, Paul
Drude, Wilhelm Wien, etc [16].

In a remarkable paper published in 1905, Einstein
abandoned the concept of aether[20]. However, Einstein’s

assertion did not cease the exploration of aether[16, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Einstein changed his attitude
later and introduced his new concept of ether[28, 29]. In
1979, A. A. Golebiewska-Lasta observed the similarity
between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the linear disloca-
tion ﬁeld [21]. V. P. Dmitriyev have studied the similar-
ity between the electromagnetism and the linear elastic-
ity since 1992[22, 24, 26]. D. J. Larson derived Maxwell’s
equations from a simple two-component solid-mechanical
aether in 1998[23]. D. Zareski gave an elastic interpre-
tation of electrodynamics in 2001[25]. I regret to admit
that it is impossible to mention all the works related to
this ﬁeld in history.

Inspired by the above mentioned works, we show that
Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetic ﬁeld can be de-
rived based on a continuum mechanics model of vacuum
and a singularity model of electric charges.

CLUES OBTAINED FROM DIMENSIONAL
ANALYSIS

According to Descartes’ scientiﬁc research program
which was based on his mechanical view of nature, the
electromagnetic phenomenon must be and can be inter-
preted based on the mechanical motions of aether parti-
cles.

Therefore, all the physical quantities appearing in the
theory of electromagnetic ﬁeld must be mechanical quan-
tities.

Thus,

in order to establish a successful mechanical
model of electromagnetic ﬁeld, we should undertake a
careful dimensional analysis of electric ﬁeld vector E,
magnetic induction vector B, the density ﬁeld of electric
charges ρq, the dielectric constant of vacuum ǫ0, magnetic
permeability of vacuum µ0, etc.

It is known that the Maxwell’s equations (1) in vacuum

can also be expressed as

∇2φ +

(∇ · A) = −

∇2A − ∇(∇ · A) − µ0ǫ0

∇φ −

∂
∂t (cid:18)

∂A
∂t (cid:19)

where φ is the scalar electromagnetic potential, A is the
vector electromagnetic potential.

Noticing the similarity between the Eq.(3) and the
equation (31) of momentum conservation of elastic solids,
it is natural to speculate that the dimension of the vec-
tor electromagnetic potential A of aether is the same of
the dimension of the displacement vector u of an elastic
solid.

In 1846, W. Thomson compared electric phenomena
with elasticity. He pointed out that the elastic displace-
ment u of an incompressible elastic solid is an possible
analogy with the vector electromagnetic potential A [16].

Inspired by this clue, let us set out to investigate in

this direction further in the following sections.

A VISCO-ELASTIC CONTINUUM MODEL OF
VACUUM

The purpose of this section is to establish a visco-

elastic continuum model of vacuum.

In 1845-1862, Stokes suggested the aether might be-
have like a glue-water jelly[30, 31, 32]. He believed that
the aether would act like a ﬂuid with respect to transla-
tional motion of large bodies through it, but would still
posses elasticity to produce small transverse vibrations.
Following Stokes, we propose a visco-elastic continuum

model of vacuum.

Hypothesis 1 Suppose the universe is ﬁlled by a kind of
material.

This material may be named aether for convenience.
In order to establish a continuum mechanical theory of
aether, we must introduce some hypotheses based on ex-
perimental data of the macroscopic behavior of vacuum.

Hypothesis 2 We suppose that the all the mechanical
quantities of the aether under consideration, such as den-
sity, displacements, strains, stresses, etc., are piecewise
continuous functions of space and time. Furthermore,
we suppose that the material points of the aether remain
one-to-one correspondence with the material points before
deformation happens.

Hypothesis 3 We suppose that
aether under consideration is homogeneous, that is ∂ρ
∂y = ∂ρ

Hypothesis 4 Suppose that the deformation processes
of aether are isothermal processes. We neglect the ther-
mal eﬀects.

{o, x1, x2, x3} which is static relative to the aether. Now
we may introduce the deﬁnition of displacement vector u
of every point in the body as

u = r − r0,

(4)

where r0 is the position of the point before the deforma-
tion, r is the position of the point after the deformation.
The displacement vector may be written as u = u1i +
u2j + u3k or u = ui + vj + wk, where i, j, k are the three
unit vectors along the three coordinates.

The gradient of the displacement vector u is the rela-

tive displacement tensor ui,j = ∂ui
∂xj

.

We can decompose the tensor ui,j into two parts, sym-

metric εij and skew-symmetric ωij [14].

ui,j =

(ui,j + uj,i) +

(ui,j − uj,i) = εij + ωij

When aether is subjected to a set of external forces,
the relative positions of the aether particles forming the
body changes.

In order to described the deformation of the body, let
us introduce a Cartesian coordinate system {o, x, y, z} or

to the deformation. The the indicial notation of the stress

Now let us turn to study the constitutive relation.
An elastic Hooke solid responds instantaneously with
respect to a external stress. A Newtonian viscous ﬂuid
responds to a shear stress by a steady ﬂow process.

In 19th century, people began to notice that some ma-
terials showed time dependence in their elastic response
with respect to external stress. When materials like
pitch, gum rubber, polymeric materials, hardened ce-
ment and even glass were loaded, an instantaneous elas-
tic deformation was followed by a continuous slow ﬂow
or creep.

Now this time-dependent response is called viscoelas-
ticity. Materials exhibits both an instantaneous elastic
elasticity and creep characteristics is called viscoelastic
materials. Viscoelastic materials were studied long ago
by Maxwell[33], Kelvin, Voigt, Boltzamann[34], etc.

Inspired by these early contributors, we propose a

visco-elastic constitutive relation of the aether.

It is natural to speculate that the constitutive relation
of the aether may be a combination of the constitutive
relations of the Hooke-solid and the Newtonian-ﬂuid.

For the Hooke-solid, we have the following the gener-

alized Hooke’s law [14, 35]

εij =

−

σmδij.

σij
2G

Y

(14)

where δij is the Kronecker symbol, σm is the mean stress,
where Y is the Yang modulus, ν is the Poisson ratio, G
is the shear modulus.

The generalized Hooke’s law Eq.(14) can also be writ-

ten as [35]

where sij is the stress deviator, eij is the strain deviator.
For the Newtonian-ﬂuid, we have the following consti-

tutive relation

deij

=

sij +

.

(18)

The materials which behave like Eq.(18) are called
Maxwell-liquid since Maxwell established such a consti-
tutive relation in 1868[33].

Eq.(18) is valid only in the case of inﬁnitesimal defor-
mation because of the presence of the derivative with re-
spect to time. Oldroyd recognized that we need a special
deﬁnition of derivative operation in order to satisfy the
principle of material frame indiﬀerence or objectivity[36].
Unfortunately, there is no unique deﬁnition of derivative
operation fulﬁl the the principle of objectivity presently.

For a simple shear experiment, we suppose

dσt

∂σt

Therefore, Eq.(18) becomes

If the shear deformation is kept constant, i.e. ∂et

we have

Eq.(22) that the shear stress remain in the Maxwell-

liquid and are damped in the course of time.

We see that G

η must have the dimension of time. Now
let us introduce the following deﬁnition of Maxwelllian

Hypothesis 9 Suppose the constitutive relation of the
aether satisﬁes Eq.(18).

Now let us introduce the following hypothesis

where sij is the stress deviator, eij is the strain deviator,
G is the shear modulus.

Since the aether behaves as the Hooke-solid during
very short time intervals, we therefore diﬀerentiate both
sides of Eq.(14) and obtain

deij

Now we can derive the the equation of momentum con-

servation based on the above hypotheses.

Let T be the time scale of a observer of the aether.
When the observer’s time scale T is the same order of
the period of wave motion of light, the Maxwelllian re-
laxation time τ is a relatively a large number. Thus, the
ﬁrst term of Eq.(24) may be neglected. Therefore, the

sij = 2Geij,

(15)

Therefore, Eq.(18) becomes

observer concludes that the strain and the stress of the
aether satisﬁes the generalized Hooke’s law.

The generalized Hooke’s law (14) can also be written

as [14, 35]

σ11 = λθ + 2Gε11
σ22 = λθ + 2Gε22
σ33 = λθ + 2Gε33
σ12 = σ21 = 2Gε12 = 2Gε21

Using Eq.(8), the equation of momentum conservation

If there exists a density ﬁeld which is continuous and
ﬁnite at all points of the space, with the exception of
individual isolated points, then these isolated points are
called density singularities. If there exists a velocity ﬁeld
which is continuous and ﬁnite at all points of the space,
with the exception of individual isolated points, then
these isolated points are called velocity singularities.

Deﬁnition 10 Suppose there exists a singularity at point
P0 = (x0, y0, z0) in a continuum. If the velocity ﬁeld of
the singularity at point P = (x, y, z) is

v(x, y, z, t) =

Q

p

(x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2 + (z − z0)2, ˆr denotes
where r =
the unit vector directed outward along the line from the
singularity to the point P = (x, y, z), then we call this
singularity a source if Q > 0 or a sink if Q < 0. Q is
called the strength of the source or sink.

A calculation shows that the strength Q of a source or
sink evaluates the volume of the ﬂuid leaving or entering
a control surface per unit time.

Deﬁnition 11 Suppose there exists a density singularity
in the aether. If the density singularity is also a veloc-
ity singularity, then we call this singularity a negative
electric charge if Q > 0 or a positive electric charge if
Q < 0, where Q is the strength of the source or sink. The
electric charge quantity of a electric charge is deﬁned as
qe = −ρQ, where ρ is the density of the aether.

A calculation shows that the mass m of a electric

charge is changing with time as

Since the electric charges continuously distributed in
the volume V are sources or sinks of aether, the rate of
mass created inside the volume V is

dm
dt

= −ρQ = qe,

(33)

where qe is the electric charge quantity of the electric
charge.

We may introduce a hypothesis that the masses of elec-
tric charges are changing so slowly relative to the time
scaler of human beings that they can be treated as con-
stants approximately.

For

the case of continuously distributed electric
charges, it is useful to introduce the following deﬁnition
of volume density of electric charges

ρs = lim

△V →0

△qe
△V

DERIVATION OF MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS IN
VACUUM

The purpose of this section is to derive Maxwell’s equa-
tions based on the above visco-elastic continuum model
of vacuum and the singularity model of electric charges.
Now let us to derive the continuity equation of aether
from mass conservation. Consider an arbitrary volume V
bounded by a closed surface S and ﬁxed in space. Sup-
pose there are electric charges continuously distributed
in the volume V . Then the total mass in volume V is

where ρ is the density of the aether.

The rate of increase of the total mass in volume V is

where v is the velocity ﬁeld of the aether.

Now according to the principle of mass conservation,
and make use of Eq.(36), Eq.(38) and Eq.(40), we have

Since the volume V is arbitrary, we have

(42)

(34)

Since the aether is homogeneous, that is ∂ρ

∂x = ∂ρ

∂y =

∂ρ

∂z = ∂ρ

∂t = 0, Eq.(42) becomes

∇ · v = −

ρe

.

(43)

According to Hypothesis 11 and Eq.(33), the masses of
a positive electric charges are changing since the strength
of a sink evaluates the volume of the aether entering the
sink per unit time. Thus, the momentum of a volume
element △V of the aether containing continuously dis-
tributed electric charges moving with an average speed
ve is changing. The increased momentum △P of the
volume element △V during a time interval △t is the de-
creased momentum of continuously distributed electric
charges contained in the volume element △V during a
time interval △t, that is,

△P = ρ(ρs△V △t)ve = −ρe△V △tve

(44)

Therefore, the equation of momentum conservation

Eq.(31) of the aether should be changed as

G∇2u + (G + λ)∇(∇ · u) + f = ρ

∂2u
∂t2 − ρeve.

(45)

In order to simplify the Eq.(47), we may introduce an

additional hypothesis as

Hypothesis 12 We suppose that the aether is incom-
pressible, that is θ = 0.

From Hypothesis 12, we have

∇ · u =

∂u
∂x

+

+

∂v

∂w

= θ = 0

(46)

Therefore, the vector form of the equation of momen-
tum conservation Eq.(31) reduces to the following form

G∇2u + f = ρ

∂2u
∂t2 − ρeve.

(47)

Applying the Stokes-Helmholtz resolution theorem,
which states that every suﬃciently smooth vector ﬁeld
may be decomposed into irrotational and solenoidal
parts, to the displacement ﬁeld u, we have

Now let us introduce the following deﬁnitions

j = ρeve,

ǫ0 =

ρa
kE

,

µ0

=

G

.

u = ∇ψ + ∇ × R

(48)

Therefore, Eq.(57) becomes

We call the ψ and R the scalar and vector displacement

potentials respectively.

Now let us introduce the deﬁnitions

∇φ = kE

(∇ψ), A = kE∇ × R,

(49)

becomes

Noticing the deﬁnitions Eq.(50) and Eq.(58), Eq.(43)

(58)

(59)

(60)

E = −kE

, B = ∇ × A,

(50)

Now we see that Eq.(52), Eq.(59) and Eq.(60) consti-

tute the Maxwell’s equations Eq.(1).

CONCLUSION

where φ is the scalar electromagnetic potential, A is the
vector electromagnetic potential, E is the electric ﬁeld
intensity, B is the magnetic induction, kE is a dimen-
sionless constant.

From Eq.(48), Eq.(49) and Eq.(50), we have

E = −∇φ −

(51)

and

∂A

∂B

,

∇ × E = −

∇ · B = 0.

Based on Eq.(49) and noticing

∇2u = ∇(∇ · u) − ∇ × (∇ × u),
∇2A = ∇(∇ · A) − ∇ × (∇ × A),

and ∇ · u = 0, ∇ · A = 0, we have kE∇2u = ∇2A.

Therefore, Eq.(47) becomes

G

∇2A + f = ρ

∂2u
∂t2 − ρeve.

(54)

Using Eq.(53), Eq.(54) becomes

∇ × (∇ × A) + f = ρ

∂2u
∂t2 − ρeve.

(55)

Now using Eq.(50), Eq.(55) becomes

It is natural to speculate that there are no other volume
forces or surface forces exerted on the aether, i.e., f = 0.
Therefore, Eq.(56) becomes

(57)

It is not a new idea to speculate that the universe may
be ﬁlled with a kind of continuously distributed material
which may be called aether.
Inspired by the early re-
searchers, we propose a visco-elastic constitutive relation
of the aether. Following Maxwell, we propose a ﬂuidic
source and sink model model of electric charges. Thus,
Maxwell’s equations in vacuum are derived by methods
of continuum mechanics based on this continuum me-
chanical model of vacuum and this singularity model of
electric charges.

DISCUSSION

There exists some interesting theoretical, experimen-
tal and applied problems in the ﬁelds of continuum me-
chanics, the classical electrodynamics, quantum electro-
dynamics and other related ﬁelds involving this theory of
electromagnetic phenomena. It is an interesting task to
generalize this theory of electromagnetic phenomena in
the static aether to the case of electromagnetic phenom-
ena of moving bodies.

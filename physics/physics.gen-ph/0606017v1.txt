Abstract

We ﬁnd relations between quantities deﬁning geometry and quantities deﬁning
the length of a curve in geometries underlying Electromagnetism and uniﬁed
model of Electromagnetism and Gravitation. We show that the length of a
vector changes along a curve in these geometries.

1 Introduction

In paper [1] a new geometry called General Geometry is formulated and it is shown
that its the most simplest case is geometry underlying electromagnetism. However,
relation between quantities deﬁning geometry F σ
λ and the length of a curve Aµ was
assumed. Next, in paper [2] it is shown that geometry underlying uniﬁed model of
electromagnetism and gravitation is also a special case of General Geometry. There,
relations between quantities deﬁning geometry F σ
µν and the length of a curve
gµν, Aµ were also assumed.

λ, Γσ

In the present paper, it is shown that relations assumed in [1] and [2] hold to be
true provided that the length of a vector changes along a curve in both geometries.
In Riemannian geometry the length of a vector does not change and this makes
it be an underlying geometry for Gravitation. If the length of a vector changes in
Riemannian geometry then it fails to be an underlying geometry for Gravitation.
This failure has been demonstrated by H. Weyl [3] who investigated Riemannian
geometry with changing length of a vector in an attempt to unify electromagnetism
and gravitation (for discussion see [4]). However, we show that the length of a
vector changes along a curve in the presence of electromagnetic ﬁeld in a geometry
completely diﬀerent from Riemannian one.

In summary, Geometry of Electromagnetism [1] with changing length of a vector
has physical interpretation as geometry underlying Electromagnetism. Riemannian
geometry with constant length of a vector has physical interpretation as geometry
underlying Gravitation. Combination of Geometry of Electromagnetism and Rie-
mannian geometry with changing length of a vector is geometry underlying uniﬁed
model of Electromagnetism and Gravitation.

In the next section we prove relations assumed in [1] and [2] and show that the

length of a vector changes along a curve in these geometries.

2 On Special Cases of General Geometry

We recall that Geometry of Electromagnetism [1] is deﬁned by

dξσ
du

= −F σ

λ(x)ξλ.

We consider the following metric

ds = qηµνdxµdxν +

Aµ(x)dxµ,

ηµν = diag(1 − 1 − 1 − 1).

(2)

q
cm

Accordingly, the length of a vector V = ξλ ∂

dl = qηµνξµξν +

Aµ(x)ξµ.

∂xλ is
q
cm

And we assume that

dl
du

= Φν(Aλ, Fµσ)ξν,

(1)

(3)

(4)

where Aµ are some functions of x , Φν are functions of Aµ and Fµν, and q, c, m are
some parameters. Equation (4) means that the length of a vector changes along a
curve due to Φν. Substitution of dl in (4) by (3) leads to equations

ξµξν(Fµν + Fνµ) = 0,

(∂µAσxµ

u − AµF µ

σ)ξσ = Φν(Aλ, Fµσ)ξν.

(5)

q
cm

The most general solution to the ﬁrst one is any antisymmetric tensor

We choose Φν such that the second equation has solution1

Fµν = −Fνµ.

Fµν =

(∂µAν − ∂νAµ).

q
cm

As it is shown in [1], curvature vector Rλ is equal to Rλ = ∂µFµλ. Equation Rλ =
0 coincides with Maxwell equation for electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ and equation for
geodesics coincides with the equation for a particle interacting with electromagnetic
ﬁeld Aµ. This allows us to interpret Aµ as electromagnetic ﬁeld and geometry deﬁned
by (1) with (2) and (4) as geometry underlying electromagnetism. q is identiﬁed
with charge, m with mass of a particle interacting with electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ, c
is the speed of the light.

If we choose Φν = 0 then the second equation in (5) reduces to

Multiplication by Aσ gives

∂µAσxµ

u − AµF µ

σ = 0.

Aσ∂µAσ = 0.

This equation is a constraint for Aµ. Therefore in order to consider general functions
Aµ of x we have to allow Φν 6= 0. Hence, the length of a vector must change along
a curve in Geometry of Electromagnetism.

Next we consider geometry underlying uniﬁed model of electromagnetism and

gravitation [2] deﬁned by

and choose metric as

and it changes as

Note that in this geometry ξρ = gρµξµ. Substitution of dl in (8) by (7) gives rise to

Solutions to the ﬁrst equation are

∂gλµ
∂xν −

∂gλν

∂gµν
∂xλ .

We choose Φ′

Fµν =

(∂µAν − ∂νAµ).

According to the results obtained in [2] we interpret gµν as gravitational ﬁeld and
Aµ as electromagnetic ﬁeld.

3 Conclusion

In this paper we considered only two special cases of General Geometry [1]. Re-
suming, geometries discussed in this paper, with appropriate metrics are underlying
geometries for physical theories. The most simplest case of General Geometry

with metric

ds = qηµνdxµdxν +

Aµ(x)dxµ

is geometry underlying Electromagnetism. Next order in xu, Riemannian geometry,

is geometry underlying Gravitation. Combination of two previous geometries

with metric

with metric

is geometry underlying uniﬁed model of Electromagnetism and Gravitation [2].

We do not discuss the other special cases in this paper. Riemannian Geometry
with metric ds = qgµνdxµdxν + Aµ(x)dxµ without parameters instead of (9) has
been considered in [5]2 and applied to Kaluza-Klein theory. As we demonstrated in
[1] any attempt to geometrize electromagnetism in geometries like Riemannian, (for
example in the so called Finsler geometry) independent of the chosen metric must
fail [6]. By choosing diﬀerent metrics we do not change geometry [5], [7], [8].

Thanks to moderators of [9] and [10] almost all attempts to sabotage these serious
of papers are made available online.

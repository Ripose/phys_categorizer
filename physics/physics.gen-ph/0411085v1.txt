A Sketch for a Quantum Theory of Gravity
Rest Mass Induced by Graviton Motion

Abstract

The numerical quantum electronic structure for the
energies of the states of the hydrogen like atoms as
given by Sommerfeld in 1915-16 is studied and is
shown to present a scheme that is able to express
a unique observer point of view. The perspective
of this observer is essentially how he, if ﬁxed on a
trapped electron, would see his and his electron’s
state of containment within the full atomic quantum
state. This particular internal view of a quantum
state is then shown to have strong analytic powers
in the extremely diﬀerent numerical scale of grav-
itation theory. This unexpected analogy becomes
possible when it is recognised that a basic part of
gravitation theory can be expressed in terms com-
pletely analogous to the quantum relativistic electro-
magnetic structure involved in Sommerfeld’s formula
for quantum state energy. The introduction section
brings together the essentials for the understanding of
the electromagnetic side of this analogy and contains
a condensation of some earlier work. The second sec-
tion Gravitation Analogy develops a theory for gravi-
tation which closely follows the quantum form to give
an exact analogy to the Sommerfeld quantum theory
of hydrogen atomic states.

Introduction

One of the great discoveries of the 20th Century was
Sommerfeld’s formula for the energy values of the
quantum states of the hydrogen like atoms. The en-
ergy values involved were those assumed by a nega-
tively charged electron orbiting a nucleus composed
of Z positively charged protons, the charged nucleus
being the source of a classical Coulomb electric po-
tential. In the context of Schr¨odinger wave mechan-
ics which is usually regarded as non-relativistic [35],
it is surprising that this relativistic formula should

appear at all and that its predictions are so accu-
rate is very remarkable. Sommerfeld’s [1] formula for
the energy of hydrogen like atoms with a Z-valued
positive charge Coulomb central ﬁeld is,

En,j,Z = m0c2 (cid:0)1 + γ2(cid:1)

−1/2

(1.1)

where

γ =

Zα
n − j − 1/2 + ((j + 1/2)2 − (Zα)2)1/2

(1.2)

with n what is usually called the principal quantum
number and j with its possible half integral values is
the quantum number for total angular momentum.
The expression (1.1) is not the last word in energy
speciﬁcation for hydrogen like atoms because it does
not include the Lamb shift complications. However,
it is extraordinarily accurate and shows how the en-
ergies depend on the charge number Z. The energies
of the ﬁrst Bohr orbits for various values of Z are
given by n = 1, j = 1/2 and 1 ≤ Z ≤ 137 and are

E1,1/2,Z = m0c2(1 − (Zα)2)1/2.

(1.3)

We are particularly interested in the speeds vB,Z with
which the trapped electron moves in these orbits for
the various values of Z. The centrifugal equilibrium
equation expresses a relation between the Bohr orbit
radius rB,Z and the Bohr orbit velocity vB,Z and is

Ze2/4πǫ0rB,Z = m0v2

B,Z.

(1.4)

Thus (1.4) supplies a deﬁnition for the velocities in
the ﬁrst Bohr orbits in terms of the ﬁrst Bohr radii
in the form

vB,Z = (Ze2/4πǫ0rB,Zm0)1/2

= (Zlcc2/rB,Z)1/2 = Zαc,

(1.5)

(1.6)

the last equality following from the well known re-
sult for the circular orbits rB,Z = rB,1/Z. Thus in
particular,

vB,1 = αc

(1.11)

and

α can be given the form

(1.8)

vB,137 = 137αc.
Sommerfeld’s formula (1.1) for the special case of the
ﬁrst Bohr orbits can easily be derived ([1], [47], [18])
as will be shown in the next paragraph. Suppose
that a hydrogen-Z atom with its single circling elec-
tron is at rest in some frame of reference S0, the elec-
tron being in the ﬁrst Bohr orbit. In this frame of
reference, the energy E(Z) of the electron will be
given by Sommerfeld’s formula for a ﬁrst Bohr or-
bit. However, for the moment let us simply call the
energy E(Z) and assume we do not know formula
(1.1). Consider the view of the situation that an ob-
server in frame of reference S moving with velocity
vB,Z relative to the ﬁrst frame such that this velocity
is also in the same direction instantaneously as that
of the direction of circling electron. At the instant
of coincidence of these velocities in magnitude and
direction the observer in S will have the electron at
rest in his frame so he will assesses its total energy as
being its rest energy plus its potential energy in the
ﬁeld of the passing centre of force on the nucleus of
the hydrogen-Z atom. This potential energy is that
of one negatively charged electron in the Coulomb
ﬁeld of the Z positively charged nucleus. This po-
tential energy is given by V = −(Ze)e/(4πǫ0rB,Z ).
Thus this observer assesses the total energy ET of
the electron to be ET = m0c2 − (Ze)e/(4πǫ0rB,Z ).
This might be called the electron orientated point of
view. Now consider what might be called the hydro-
gen ﬁrst Bohr state point of view. We are assuming
that the energy of the electron in this state is given
by E(Z) = M (Z)c2, M (Z) being the equivalent mass
of this state. M (Z) is rest mass for this state in the
frame S0 in which the state is at rest. The observer
in S will see this mass as a rest mass M (Z) with a
charge Ze moving with velocity −vB,Z. Thus from
this point of view he will assess the energy in mo-
tion as M (Z)c2/(1 − (vB,Z /c)2)1/2 and see it as the
nuclear charge Ze moving in the Coulomb potential
V ′ = −e(Ze)/(4πǫ0rB,Z) due to his local captured
electron. Thus his assessment of the total energy
from the nuclear state in motion point of view is
E′
T = M (Z)c2/(1−(vB,Z/c)2)1/2−e(Ze)/(4πǫ0rB,Z ).
The two points of view are two diﬀerent ways that
the observer in S can perceive the overall situation.
Both of the energies ET and E′
T are the energies of
the trapped electron in hydrogen-Z as seen in the
frame of reference S albeit from the two points of
view. Thus they should be numerically equal. The
two potential energies from the two points of view are
also equal. Thus we have the result

m0c2 = M (Z)c2/(1 − (vB,Z/c)2)1/2
= M (Z)c2/ sin(χ∗(Z)).

(1.9)

so that

α = cos(χ∗(Z))/Z,

vB,Z = Zαc

= c cos(χ∗(Z)).

Hence (1.9) becomes

E(Z) = M (Z)c2 = m0c2 sin(χ

∗

(Z))

(1.12)

which agrees with (1.3). If the Compton wave length
lm of a rest mass m is deﬁned generally as ~/(mc),
then (1.12) gives

lm0 = lM(Z) sin(χ

(Z)).

∗

(1.13)

The maximum value for Z, Z = 137, represents
choosing the last member of the hydrogen like set
of atoms for analysis, H137. This particular atom is
a long way outside present day condition possibilities.
It is a theoretical structure but it has led to impor-
tant theoretical discoveries, notably the derivation
of a theoretical formula for α ([33],[2],[3],[4],[16],[23],
[24],[25],[28],[21],[22],[20]). Here I shall show that it
also has potential for steering us towards an under-
standing of rest mass in terms of gravitation. This
aspect will be pursued in the next section. However
before that, I shall here pull together some earlier
results that will be required in that study. We shall
need deﬁnitions for some standard Schr¨odinger quan-
tum theory quantities. The basic ones are, the clas-
sical electron radius which here will be demoted by
re but which was denoted in earlier work by lc, the
Compton wavelength of the electron, λC and its di-
vided by 2π varient, ¯λC here denoted by 2l0. Less ba-
sic are the radii of the ﬁrst Bohr orbits rB,Z and the
velocities in those orbits vB,Z . These deﬁnitions are
now set out in the order introduced above together
with representations for α and the general formula
for dimensionless coupling constants.

INTRODUCTION

In relation to the table above, a remark about the
relation between α(n1, n2) and the integer parame-
ter n1 will be seen to have important signiﬁcance
in the work to follow. The representation of the
ﬁne structure constant α with emphasis on the con-
stant characteristic given by (1.20) depends on the
many valued parameter Z. This representation is
very useful in bringing together the physical descrip-
tion for the 137 members of the hydrogen like family
of atoms. As we have seen above it is the member
of that set H137 with the ﬁrst Bohr orbit described
by the one orbiting electron at the maximum speed
vB,137 = 137α(137, 29)c that can be used to explain
important fundamental physics issues. This speed
vB,137 is the speed that gives the lowest rest mass
M (137) for the rest mass generation process (1.12)
for the electron rest mass m0. Thus in the quan-
tum electromagnetic context M (137) can be taken to
be the most fundamental particle-like mass or small-
est mass unit and the smallness of its value depends
on the closeness of the light speed multiplier quan-
tity 137α(137, 29) to unity. In the gravitation anal-
ogy context to follow this mass value M (137) will be
shown to have an analogy mG greatly smaller nu-
merically and so much as to be measurably indis-
tinguishable from a photon in a limiting situation.

Before discussing what this all has to do with grav-
ity let us consider the physical implication of equa-
tions (1.9) and (1.12). Both of these equations repre-
sent a simple relation between the rest mass M (Z) of
an atomic state and the rest mass m0 of an electron
and of course there are many such relations according
to the Z value, that is to say, the atomic system cho-
sen. Equation(1.9) clearly means that the electron’s

rest mass can be fully expressed as the relativistic en-
ergy of a particle of rest mass M (Z) in motion with
the velocity vB,Z . From the (1.12) equation, the ra-
tio of the mass M (Z) to the electron’s rest mass is
in general a relatively small quantity because the or-
bital velocity vB,Z can have values very close to the
velocity of light. The largest value that the orbital
velocity vB,Z can have is that which occurs in the
case of Hydrogen-137 when Z = 137 and in this case
(1.12) gives the ratio of the mass M (137) to the mass
m0 of the electron to be the last displayed result be-
low.

M (137)/m0 = 0.02292 . . . . . .

(1.24)

(1.25)
(1.26)

Hence equation (1.9) essentially expresses the rest
mass m0 of an electron in terms of the sub-mass
M (137), about a 200th part of the electron’s mass,
in motion. Motion here is generating rest mass by
the standard relativistic kinematic-dynamic process.
Thus this analysis gives a model for the internal dy-
namics of the electron in terms of sub-particle in
motion structure. This, of course, is the trend of
theoretical physics matter analysis that has occupied
most of the last century, the decomposition of a sys-
tem into successively smaller mass sub-systems. The
puzzling question is, does this descending prolifera-
tion go on without limit or are there truly funda-
mental masses that will ultimately be encountered?
However, though that question cannot now be an-
swered every step downwards is progress but within
the context of Sommerfeld quantum theory we are
here at a base level because M (137) is the smallest
valued mass state to occur.
It will be shown that
the downward structure picture can be taken very
much further when we examine the gravitation anal-
ogy. There is the well known but curious property of
mass in quantum systems that very large masses are
often very localized and very small masses can be dis-
tributed over large regions. This aspect is reﬂected in
the way mass appears in the Compton wave lengths
such as ¯λ for example in equation (1.15) where a small
mass in the denominator gives a large wave length
and vice versa. This aspect is related to quantum
uncertainty and we shall see that it has important
consequences in the analogy to be developed in the
next section. There is another feature of the of the
rest mass generation formula (1.9) that will be seen
to play an important part in the gravitation story
to come. Rest mass is the most important energy
idea that emerged from relativity theory. Here we
can see it has the special role of supplying a theoret-
ical observer reference frame from which a particu-

lar energy aspect of the electromagnet system takes
on a very simple form. Of course, an observer can-
not sit on an electron but it seems that the electron
feels its quantum electronic states relative to its own
rest mass platform as though it is disconnected from
such issues as total system rest mass weighting to
the actual space background or to the wider system
in which its states may be imbedded. The actual
mass structure or the centre of gravity of the mas-
sive nucleus of an atom such as that of H137 does
not come into the derivation of the relation between
state rest mass M (Z) and kinetically generated rest
mass m0 of the orbiting electron. If H137 were found
to exist physically, besides the 137 protons in its nu-
cleus, one might expect it to further contain a large
number of neutrons so that altogether it would be
very massive. This all implies the possible generality
of a theoretical unique observer ﬁxed on the particle
viewpoint which is blind to system embedding. The
valuable consequence that follows from this is that we
can study the electron along with its internal states
as though it is in a stand alone condition and just in
a low velocity unbound state. Perhaps this is merely
the recognition of a principle that the internal states
of a particle are relative to the particle’s rest frame!
I shall refer to this as the internal relativity princi-
ple for a particle. Essentially, this principle allows
role reversal for nucleus and bound rotating parti-
cle. This aspect will also be exploited in the gravi-
tation context. One may well ask where within the
H137 atom is the generating state mass M (137) to be
found. The answer to this is within a transverse speed
of light horizon determined by a rotating radius vec-
tor rd = c/ω rotating with the orbiting electron such
that rB,137ω = vB,137. The values of rd and rB,137 are
very close in value, rB,137/rd ≈ cos(π/137) ≈ 1. See
ﬁgure 1, where the orbiting electron is represented
as an extended wave conﬁned in the angular segment
π/137 between the radii ra(137) and rb(137) its mean
position being at radius, rc = rB,137. The state rest
mass M (137) shares the same rest frame in which the
centre of force is at rest.

2 Gravitation Analogue

The clue that suggests how to quantize gravity comes
from one of the three very large pure numbers that
have been known about for many years and were
extensively studied and used by (Eddington, Dirac,
Jordon, Dick, Hayakawa, Carter [38]) and others
([5],[6],[1],[7],[8],[9]) in their theoretical work. Pre-
viously, I have denoted this number by RP E indicat-
ing that it is the ratio of the electromagnet potential
energy of a proton electron pair to the gravitational

potential energy of an electron proton pair. This ra-
tio clearly does not depend on the separation of the
two particle as it would appear in the numerator and
denominator of this ratio and so would cancel. Here
I shall denote it by ξ = RP E. Its deﬁnition is

ξ = α~c/(Gmpme) = RP E,

(2.1)

where G is the constant of gravitation mp is the rest
mass of a proton and me = m0 is the rest mass of
an electron. α is the dimensionless coupling constant
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Thus we can identify
the dimensionless electromagnetic quantum value for
gravitational coupling as αG, say, so that

and then

αG = Gmpme/(~c)

ξ = α/αG.

(2.2)

(2.3)

For the purpose of developing this model for a quan-
tum theory of gravity, I shall make the working as-
sumption that all quantum related coupling constants
are related to or are members of the set QC =
{α(n1, n2)} deﬁned by equation (1.22). As all mem-
bers of this set are dimensionless, we can then expect
to ﬁnd αG within this set. Thus I shall represent αG
as

′
G),

(2.4)

αG = α(NG, N
where the pair of integers NG, N ′
G are to be deter-
mined.
If we compare this equation with equation
(1.12) we see that the electromagnetic analogue for
the maximum value of NG is 137 and for N ′
G it is 29.
Using equation (1.22), the ξ ratio (2.2) can be given
the more detailed form,

ξ = α(137, 29)/α(NG, N

′
G).

(2.5)

. We can now usefully use a generalization of a for-
mula for the gravitation constant G. The original was
suggested by Ross McPherson [34] based on his ob-
servation of a near numerical coincidence between ξ
and the quantum frequency of the proton’s rest mass
multiplied by 1016. The generalised form to be used
here will be expressed in terms of diﬀerent physical
constants and will have the usual dimensional form
g m3s−2 but will be expressed as a function of a
k−1
time tn. It has the deﬁnition,

G(tn) = α~2H(tn)/(m2
H(tn) = 1/(tn + t0),

near the beginning of the universe. T is a nominal
time for which the universe is assumed to have ex-
isted. mp is the rest mass of a proton and me is the
rest mass of an electron. From (2.2), (2.6) and (2.8)
we can now derive

mass generation equation (1.12) for the proton’s rest
mass is

mpc2 = mG(ZG)c2/(1 − (vG,ZG/c)2)1/2

αG can be given the form

αG = cos(χ∗

G(ZG))/ZG.

(2.23)

R(tn) = cT (tn) is a nominal radius for the universe
now and rp is the classical radius of the proton.
We note that the dimensionless gravitational cou-
pling constant αG(tn) dpends on the time tn through
the dependence of the radius of the universe through
the time tn. Equation (2.9) enables us to complete
the analogy between quantum theory and gravitation
theory. If we compare equation (2.10) with equation
(1.20) while assuming that αG is the gravitational
analogue α,
it follows that rp is the gravitational
analogue of re = lc and a radial length R0 related
to R(tn) is the gravitational analogue of ¯λC = 2l0.
The rest mass of a graviton mG, say, is naturally de-
ﬁned as the rest mass which has a Compton wave
length R0 = ~G/(mGc) so that we can write down
the gravitational analogue for equation (1.12) as

mG(ZG) = mp sin(χ

3 Conclusions

As suggested in the title, I regard the material pre-
sented here as a sketch for a quantum theory of grav-
itation. However, this material is detailed in that it
shows a way in which the very small quantum the-
ory domain of atomic systems can be integrated with
the very large cosmology domain within a single the-
ory. The fundamental theories that are called upon
to render this construction possible are Sommerfeld’s
relativistic formula for quantum states together with
this author’s theory for quantum coupling constants.
A physical result that emerges from this construc-
tion is a relativistic dynamical way in which the rest
mass of the proton can be seen as formed from the
kinematic’s of what I have called here, a graviton, a
particle with the very small rest mass, mG. As the
theory has been developed here, the rest mass of this
particle is about a 1/1000th part of the rest mass of

4 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

an electron. However, the construction here is limited
by experimental knowledge of the true values of the
gravitational and other constants and the consequent
diﬃculty of reliably being able to work out the arith-
metic of the very large numbers that are involved. It
seems that with more reliably accurate information it
will be possible to assert that mG has a limiting value
zero. Almost putting it on a par with the photon or
neutrino. Further more it’s orbits are very large ra-
dius circles which are limiting straight lines, if the
universe is suﬃciently large, again showing a close
relation with the photon or neutrino. The angular
velocity of the electronic states which are analogous
to the mG states have spin 1/2 so perhaps it is the
neutrino with its spin 1/2 that is the key to the under-
standing of quantum gravity. The theory given here
suggests that the rest mass of the proton originates
from the graviton kinematics. Possibly this is extend-
able to some extent to all the hadrons though other
considerations may well be involved. Clearly the very
complex rest mass relations between the many ele-
mentary particles is barely touched by this rest mass
generation result for the proton. However it could
be a useful start to revelations in that context.
It
has been shown that an orbiting proton moving on a
very large radius path is the gravitational analogue
of the orbiting electron in the Sommerfeld quantum
electronic theory. Included, is the possibility that the
radius of the proton’s path is so large that it is indis-
tinguishable from a straight line. The structure given
here enables us to identify the gravitational potential
analogous to the hydrogen137 electric central poten-
tial V (r) = 137α~c/r to which a proton is subjected
generally and is the kinematic source of its rest mass
mp. This is given by

nite sphere within the radius RG. RG is the radius of
the universe so here we have the situation of greatly
distant masses determining the local rest mass mp
of the proton. This is a clear indication of the ap-
propriateness of Mach’s Principle ([47], [37],[32],[36])
in the context of this theoretical construction. This
contrasts sharply with work on Mach’s principle in
relation to the local standard of zero rotation ([47],
[40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]) which does not seem to
be directly related to the local inertia problem. The
key result that connects the quantum domain with
the cosmological domain is the relation between the
graviton mass mG(tn) and the radius of the universe
R(tn) at time tn, now. They are both dependent
on time and are related by a rest length radius, R0,
of the universe coinciding with the crossed Compton
wavelength, ¯λG,0 of the mass mG,

¯λG(tn) = R0(1 − (vG,ZG /c)2)1/2 = R(tn)

(3.3)

where

R0 = ~G/mGc = ¯λG,0.

From (3.2) it can be seen that that the central force
that holds the proton in its orbit arises from the grav-
itational attraction of a total mass, ξNGme, com-
prised of NG electronic sub-masses of strength ξme
in analogy with the case of H137 where the central
force is composed of a total charge, 137e, comprised
of 137 electronic sub-charges of strength e. Thus if
we appeal to the particle internal relativity principle
for a proton and its internal gravitational states we
see that the proton’s rest mass arises from a centre of
force at a distance RG from its position. This centre
of force is on a reference frame which will also be host
for the internal proton rest mass gravitational gener-
ating mass mG. In keeping with the usual classical
gravitational potential theory, this centre of force can
be thought oﬀ as a mass distribution spread over a ﬁ-

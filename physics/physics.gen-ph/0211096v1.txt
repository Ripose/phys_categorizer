Abstract. Some necessary and suﬃcient conditions allowing a previously un-
known space to be explored through scanning operators are reexamined with respect
to measure theory. Some generalized conceptions of distances and dimensionality
evaluation are proposed, together with their conditions of validity and range of ap-
plication to topological spaces. The existence of a Boolean lattice with fractal prop-
erties originating from nonwellfounded properties of the empty set is demonstrated.
This lattice provides a substrate with both discrete and continuous properties, from
which existence of physical universes can be proved, up to the function of conscious
perception. Spacetime emerges as an ordered sequence of mappings of closed 3-D
Ponicar´e sections of a topological 4-space provided by the lattice, and the function
of conscious perception is founded on the same properties. Self-evaluation of a sys-
tem is possible against indecidability barriers through anticipatory mental imaging
occurring in biological brain systems; then our embedding universe should be in
principle accessible to knowledge. The possibility of existence of spaces with fuzzy
dimension or with adjoined parts with decreasing dimensions is raised, together with
possible tools for their study.

The work presented here provides the introductory foundations supporting a new
theory of space whose physical predictions (suppressing the opposition of quantum
and relativistic approaches) and experimental proofs are presented in details in Parts
2 and 3 of the study.

Introduction

Starting from perceptive aspects, experimental sciences give rise to theoretical
descriptions of hidden features of the surrounding world. On the other hand, the
mathematical theory of demonstration teaches that any property of a given object,
from a canonical particle to the universe, must be consistent with the characteristics
of the corresponding embedding space (Bounias, 2000a). In short, since what must
be true in abstract mathematical conditions should also be fulﬁlled upon application
to the observable world, whether the concept of ’reality’ has a meaning or not. Con-
versely, since similar predictions can infer when classical properties of Spacetime are
tested against various theories, e.g. an unbounded or a bounded (non-Archimedean)
algebra (Avinash and Rvachev, 2000), the most general features should be accessible
without previous assumptions about peculiarities of the explored spaces.

Indeed, even the abstract branch of sciences, e.g. pure mathematics, show a ten-
dency to going to a form of ”experimental research”, essentially under the pressure of
some limitations that metamathematical considerations raise about the fundamen-
tal questions of decidability (Chaitin, 1998-1999). However, algorithmic information
theory does not embrace the whole of mathematics, and the theory of demonstration
escapes the limitations of arithmetical axiomatics, in particular through anticipa-
tory processes (Bounias, 2000b; 2001). To which extent the real world should obey
just arithmetics rules remains to be supported, and instead, the foundations of the
existence and functionality of a physical world have been shown to be more widely
provided by general topology (Bounias, 2000a). On the other hand, how to explore
a world considered as a system has been matter of thorough investigation by Lin
(1988; 1989).

The goal of the present work is to examine in depth some founding mathematical
conditions for a scientiﬁc scanning of a physical world to be possible through deﬁ-
nitely appropriate tools. In this respect, it is kept in mind that human perceptions
play a part, at least since humans (which includes scientists) are self-conscious of
their existence through their perception of an outside world, while they believe in
the existence of this outside world because they perceive it. This ”judge and party”
antinomy will be addressed in the present essay.

The ﬁrst part of this essay is dealing with the notions of measure and distances
in a broad topological sense, including for the assessment of the dimensionality of
a space whose detached pieces (i.e. the data collected through apparatus from a
remote world) are scatteredly displayed on the table of a scientist, in view of a
reconstruction of the original features. The existence of an abstract lattice will be
deduced and shown to stand for the universe substrate (or ”space”). A second part
will focus on speciﬁc features of this lattice and a confrontation of this theoretical
framework with the corresponding model of Krasnoholovets and Ivanovsky (1993)
about quantum to cosmic scales of our observed universe will be presented, along
with experimental probes of both the theory and the model. A third part will
further present the structures predicted for elementary particles whose existence
derives from the described model, and lead to a confrontation of the predictive
performances of the various theories in course.

1. Preliminaries

1.1. About the concepts of measure and distances

Whatever the actual structure of our observable spacetime, no system of measure
can be operational if it does not match with the properties of the measured objects.
Scanning an light-opaque world with a light beam, by ignorance of the fundamental
structure of what is explored, though a caricatural example, illustrates the principle
of a necessarily failing device, those results would raise discrepancies in knowledge
of the studied world. An example is given by the recent development of ultraviolet
astronomy: when the sky is scanned through ultraviolet instead of visible radiation,
the resulting extreme ultraviolet astrophysical picture of our surrounding universe
becomes diﬀerent (Malina, 2000).

One of the problems faced by modeling unknown worlds could be called ”the
syndrome of polynomial adjustment”. In eﬀect, given an experimental curve rep-
resenting the behavior of a system whose real mechanism is unknown, one can
generally perform a statistical adjustment with using a polynomial system like
P(i = 0 →N) ai· xi. Then, using an apparatus adjusted to test for the ﬁtting of
M =
the N+l parameters to observational data will require increasingly accurate adjust-
ment, so as to convincingly reﬂect the natural phenomenon within some boundaries,
while if the real equation is mathematically incompatible with the polynomial, there
will remain some irreducible parts in the ﬁtting attempts. This might well be what
occurs to the standard cosmological model and its 17 variables, with its failure below
some quantum scales (Arkani-Hamed et al., 2000). Furthermore, Wu and Lin (2002)
have demonstrated how the approximations of solutions of equations describing non-
linear systems mask the real structures of these systems. It may be that what is
tested in accelerators is a kind of self-evaluation of the model, which poses a prob-
lem with respect to the indecidability of computed systems as successively raised
by Godel (1931), Church (1934), Turing (1936), and more recently Chaitin, (1998-
1999). However, mathematical limits in computed systems can be overpassed by
the biological brain’s system, due to its property of self-decided anticipatory mental
imaging (Bounias, 2001). It will be shown here how this makes eventually possible
a scanning of an unknown universe by a part of itself represented by an internal
observer.

1.1.1. Measure

The concept of measure usually involves such particular features as the exis-
tence of mappings and the indexation of collections of subsets on natural integers.
Classically, a measure is a comparison of the measured object with some unit taken
as a standard (James & James, 1992). However, sets or spaces and functions are
measurable under various conditions which are cross-connected. A mapping f of a
set E into a topological space T is measurable if the reciprocal image of a open of
T by f is measurable in E, while a set measure on E is a mapping m of a tribe B of
sets of E in the interval [0, ∞], exhibiting denumerable additivity for any sequence
of disjoint subsets (b n) of B, and denumerable ﬁniteness, i.e. respectively:

(1.1)

∃ An, An ∈ B,

E = ∪ An,

∀ ∈ N, m(An) is ﬁnite.

(1.2)

(iii) (J) is growing: E ⊂ F ⇒ J(E) ⊂ J(F);

Now, coming to the ”unit used as a standard”, this is the part played by a gauge
(J). Again, a gauge is a function deﬁned on all bounded sets of the considered space,
(i) a singleton has
usually having non-zero real values, such that (Tricot, 1999):
measure naught: V x, J({x}) = 0; (ii) (J) is continued with respect to the Hausdorﬀ
(iv) (J) is linear: F(r·E) :
distance;
r·J(E). This implies that the concept of distance is deﬁned : usually, a diameter, a
size, or a deviation are currently used, and it should be pointed that such distances
need to be applied on totally ordered sets. Even the Caratheodory measure (µ∗)
poses some conditions which again involve a common gauge to be used: (i) A ⊂
B ⇒ µ(A)≤ µ∗(B); (ii) for a sequence of subsets (Ei): µ∗ ⊂(Ri) ≤ Σ µ∗(Ri); (iii)
∠(A,B), A ∩ B= Ø: µ∗(A ∪ B)= µ∗(A)+µ∗(B) (in consistency with (1.1)); (iv)
µ∗(E)= µ∗(A ∩ E)+µ∗(∁E A ∩ E).

The Jordan and Lebesgue measures involve respective mappings (I) and (m∗)
In spaces of the Rn type,
on spaces which must be provided with ∩, ∪ and ∁.
tessellattion by balls are involved (Bounias and Bonaly, 1996), which again demands
a distance to be available for the measure of diameters of intervals.

A set of measure naught has been deﬁned by Borel (1912) ﬁrst as a linear set (E)
such that, given a number (e) as small as needed, all points of E can be contained
in intervals whose sum is lower than (e).

Remark 1.1.1. Applying Borel intervals imposes that appropriate embedding
spaces are available for allowing these intervals to exist. This may appear as a
not explicitly formulated axiom, which might involve important consequences (see
below).

1.1.2. A corollary on topological probabilities

Given a set measure (P) on a space E= ((X,A),⊥), (A) a tribe of parts of X,
then (Chambadal, 1981): for a ∈ A, P(a) = Probability of (a) and P(X) = 1; for A,B
in X, one has P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B); for a sequence {An} of disjoint subspaces,
one has: lim n→∞ P(An) = 0.

A link can be noted with the Urysohn’s theorem: let E, F be two disjoint parts
of a metric space W: there exists a continued function f of W in the real interval [0,1]
such that f (x) = 0 for any x ∈ E, f(x) = 1 for any x ∈ F, and 0 < f (x) > 1 in all
other cases. This has been shown to deﬁne conditions providing a probabilistic form
to a determined structure holding for a deterministic event (Bonaly and Bounias,
1995). In eﬀect, if W is the embedding space and S a particular state of universe
in W as recalled in section 3 below. Let C the complementary of S in W, and x an
object in the set of closed sets in W. Let IS(x) be an indicative function such that
IS(x) = 1 if x ∈ S and IS(x) = 0 if x ∈ C. Writing IS(x) = P(X): x ∈ S ⇒ P(x) = 1;
x ∈ X ⇒ P(x) = 0 and 0 < P(x) < 1 in all other cases.

A probabilistic adjustment, as accurate as it can show, is thus not a proof that

a phenomenon is probabilistic in its essence.

1.1.3. Distances

1.1.3.1. Following Borel, the length of an interval F = [a,b] is :

L(F) = (b − a) −

L(C n)

X
n

(1.3)

the open intervals inserted in the fundamental

where C n are the adjoined, i.e.
segment.

1.1.3.2. Such a distance is required in the Hausdorﬀ distances of sets (E) and (F):
Let E(e) and F(e) the covers of E or F by balls B(x,e), respectively for x ∈ E or x
∈ F,

dist H(E, F) = inf{e : E ⊂ F(e) ∧ F ⊂ E(e)}

dist H(E, F) = (x ⊂ E, y ⊂ F : inf dist(x, y))

(1.4a)

(1.4b)

Since such a distance, as well as most of classical ones, is not necessarily compati-
ble with topological properties of the concerned spaces, Borel provided an alternative
deﬁnition of a set with measure naught: the set (E) should be Vitali-covered by a
sequence of intervals (Un) such that: (i) each point of E belongs to a inﬁnite number
of these intervals; (ii) the sum of the diameters of these intervals is ﬁnite.

However, while the intervals can be replaced by topological balls, the evaluation

of their diameter still needs an appropriate general deﬁnition of a distance.

1.1.3.3. A more general approach (Weisstein, 1999b) involves a path ϕ(x,y) such
that ϕ(0) = x and ϕ(1) = y.

1.1.3.4. For the case of sets A and B in a partly ordered space, the symmetric
diﬀerence ∆(A, B) = ∁A ∪ B(A ∩ B) has been proved to be a true distance also holding
for more than two sets (Bounias and Bonaly, 1996; Bounias, 1997-1999). However,
if A ∪ B = Ø, this distance remains ∆ = A ∪ B, regardless of the situation of A and
B within an embedding space E such that (A, B) ⊂ E. A solution to this problem
will be derived below in terms of a separating distance versus an intrinsic distance.

1.2. On the assessment of space dimensions

One important point is the following : in a given set of which members structure
is not previously known, a major problem is the distinction between unordered
Nuples and ordered N-uples. This is essential for the assessment of the actual
dimension of a space.

1.2.1. Fractal to topological dimension

Given a fundamental segment (AB) and intervals Li = [Ai, A(i+1)], a generator
is composed of the union of several such intervals: G = ∪ (i ∈ [1, n])(Li). Let the
similarity coeﬃcients be deﬁned for each interval by ̺i = dist(Ai, A(i+1))/dist(AB).
The similarity exponent of Bouligand is (e) such that for a generator with n

parts:

5

When all intervals have (at least nearly) the same size, then the various dimen-
sion approaches according to Bouligand, Minkowsky, Hausdorﬀ and Besicovitch are
reﬂected in the resulting relation:

that is:

(̺i) e = 1.

X
i ∈ [1, n]

n · (̺) e = l,

e ≈ Log n/Log ̺.

(2.1)

(2.2a)

(2.2b)

When e is an integer, it reﬂects a topological dimension, since this means that a
fundamental space E can be tessellatted with an entire number of identical balls B
exhibiting a similarity with E, upon coeﬃcient ̺.

1.2.2. Parts, ordered N-uples and simplexes

1.2.2.1. Parts. A set is composed of members of which some are themselves
containing further members. In solving the Russell and Burali-Forti paradoxes by
making more accurate the deﬁnition of a set, Mirimanoﬀ (1917) classiﬁed members
in nuclei (i.e. singletons or ”atoms”) with no members inside themselves, and parts
containing members. Then, a set E is said ﬁrst kind (Ei) if it is isomorph to none of
its members, and second kind (En) if it is isomorph to at least one of its members.
Hence:

E = {a,b,c, (d,e,f,)} is ﬁrst kind since X = (d, e, f) is not isomorph to

{(a,b,c,(X)}.

F = {a, (b, (c, (Z))} is second kind since by posing H={c,(Z)} and G = {b,
(H)}, it appears that F = (a,(G)} is isomorph to G = {b, (H)},as well as to H, and
eventually further to members of H. Mirimanoﬀ called a ’descent’ a structure of the
following form, where (E) denotes a set or part of set, and (e) a nucleus:

E(n) = {e(n), (En+1)}.

(3.1)

A descent is ﬁnite if none of its parts is inﬁnitely iterated. Then, a second kind
set is ordinary if its descent is ﬁnite and extraordinary if its descent include some
inﬁnite part. One can recognize a fractal feature in an extraordinary second kind
set.

Remark 1.2. A ﬁnite number (n) of iterations provides a form of measure called
the length of the descent. In the above example of set F, assuming Z is not isomorph
to F, the sequence {F, G, H} is bijectively mapped on segment {1, 2, 3} of natural
integers.

1.2.2.2. ordered N-uples. Let the members of the above set E be ordered into a
structure of the type of F, for example: F′ ={a, (b, (c, (d,e,f)))}.

The length of the descent of the exempliﬁed F′′ is L(F′) = 3, and the last part
is not isomorph to F′. Now, suppose that members (a, b, c, ...) are similar, that
is no particular structure nor essential feature allow one to be distinguished from

6

the other. Then, F′ could be written in the alternative form: F′′ ={{a},{a,{a,...}}}.
This indicates the availability of an order to hold on F′′. Usually, a part (a,b) or
{a,b} is not ordered until it can be written in the form: (ab) = {{a}, {a,b}}. The
nonempty part of (ab) owns a lower boundary: {a}, and an upper boundary: (ab)
itself. Similarly:

(abc) = {{a}, {a, (a, b)}, {a, (a, b), (a, b, c)}}, etc.

(3.2)

Stepping from a part (a,b,c,...)

to a N-uple (abc) needs that singletons are
available in replicates. Two cases are met: if members (a,b,c,...) are not identical,
replicates can be found in the set of parts of the set. Otherwise, if members are
similar singletons, then the set is just isomorphic with a segment of the set of natural
integers.

In both cases, for any pair of members (i.e. as subset members or singletons),
the Cartesian product will give a set of ordered pairs. Repeating the operation in
turn gives ordered N-uples. A formal distinction of (xy), (x,y) and {x,y} will appear
below.

1.2.2.3. Simplexes. A simplex is the smaller collection of points that allows the
set to reach a maximum dimension. In a general accepting, it should be noted that
the singletons of the set are called vertices and ordered N-uples are (N-1)-faces AN−1.
A set of (N+1) members can provide a structure of dimension at most (N), that is:
a connected ”(N+l)- object” has dimension d ≤ N. The number of 1-faces A1 will
be (N + 1)N/2!, the number of 2-faces A2 will be (N + 1) · N · (N − 1)/3!, n(A3) =
(N+1)·N·(N−1)·(N−2)/4!, and ﬁnally n(Ak) = (N+1)·N·(N−1)...(N−k+1)/(k+1)!
(Banchoﬀ, 1996).

One question emerging now with respect to the purpose of this study is the
following: given a set of N points, how to evaluate the dimension of the space
embedding these points?

2. Distances and dimensions revisited

2.1. The relativity of a general form of measure and distance

Our approach aims at searching for distances that would be compatible with
both the involved topologies and the scanning of objects not yet known in the studied
spaces. No such conﬁguration is believed to be an exception nor a general case.

2.1.1. General case of a not necessarily ordered topological distance

Proposition 2.1. A generalized distance between spaces A,B within their common
embedding space E is provided by the intersection of a path-set ϕ(A,B) joining each
member of A to each member of B with the complementary of A and B in E, such
that: ϕ(A,B) is a continued sequence of a function f of a gauge (J) belonging to the
ultraﬁlter of topologies on {E, A, B,...}.

Proof. (i) A measure comes to a reality when it maps a perceiving system (e.g. A)
to a perceived one (e.g. B) so that B is said measured by A within E. It has been
formerly shown that A and B should be topologically closed, since Jordan’s points

7

Figure 1: Some features of the measure of a distance between closed sets (A,B) in an
embedding space E. Space A is the perceiver and space B is the perceived one. Points a,
b, d1, d2 are Jordan’s points.

are needed for the characterization of a path joining any point of the interior of B
to a point of the interior of A. The nonempty intersection b of the path with the
frontier ∂ B of B leads to the intersection a of the path with the frontier ∂ A of A,
and a sequence of mappings u(a) of (a) to a ﬁxed point f(a) = a in A provides the
mathematical foundation of a mental image (Bounias and Bonaly, 1997) (Figure 1).
The path ϕ(A,B) is a set composed as follows: (i) ϕ(A, B) = ∪ a∈A, b∈B ϕ(a, b),

all deﬁned in a sequence interval [0, f n(x)], x ∈ E.

Then, for any closed D situated between A and B, f n(m) intersects the frontiers
of B, D, and A: thus, the sequence f n has some of its points identiﬁed with b,
(di, dj, ... ∈ ∂ D), and a. Therefore, the relative distance of A and B in E, noted
ΛE(A, B) is contained in ϕ(A,B):

ΛE(A, B) ⊆ ϕ(A, B)

(4.1)

Eventually one may have in the above case : min{ΛE(A, B)} = {b, di, dj, ..., a},

while in all cases: inf{ΛE(A, B)} = {b ∨ a}. Denote by E◦ the interior of E, then:

min{ϕ(A, B) ∩ E◦} is a geodesic of space E connecting A to B

max{ϕ(A, B) ∩ E◦ ∪ ∁E◦(A ∪ B)} is tesselation of E out of A and B

(4.2a)

(4.2b)

It is noteworthy that relation (4.2a) refers to dimΛ = dimϕ, while in relation

(4.2b) the dimension of the probe is that of the scanned sets.

(ii) Let J = f n(m), such that: ϕ(0) = b and ϕf n(m) = a. Then, m ∈ U(E), with
U(E) the ultraﬁlter on topologies of E.

8

Suppose that m /∈ U(E). Then, there exists a ﬁlter FA holding on A and a ﬁlter
FB holding on B, such that FA 6= FB. Let x ∈ FA: there exists y ∈ FB with x 6= y
and y /∈ FA.

Therefore, if x ∈ ϕf n(m), y /∈ ϕf n(m) and the path-set does not measure B

from a perception by A. That m ∈ U(E) is a necessary condition.

(iii) Let (O) be a open set of E. Then, a member of ϕ(A,B) joining B to A through
O meets no frontier other than B and ∂ A, and the obtained ΛE(A, B) ignores set O.
As a consequence: only closed structures can be measured in a topological space by
a path founded on a sequence of Jordan’s points: this justiﬁes and generalizes the
Borel measure recalled above. In contrast, if a closed set D contains closed subsets,
e.g. D′ ⊂ D, then there is a member of ϕ(A,B) that intersects D′. If in addition
the path is founded on f n(m), m ∈ U(E), there exists nonempty intersections of
the type d′i, d′j ∈ f n(m) ∩ ∂ D′. Therefore, ΛE(A, B) will include d′i and d′j to the
measured distance. This shows that ϕ(A, B) ∩ E◦ is a growing function deﬁned for
any Jordan point, which is a characteristic of a Gauge. In addition, the operator
ΛE(B, A) deﬁned by this way meets the characteristics of a Fr´echet metrics, since
the proximity of two points a and b can be mapped into the set of natural integers
for that, it suﬃces that two members
and even to the set of rational numbers:

(iv) Suppose that one path ϕ(a,b) meets an empty space {Ø}. Then a discontinuity

= Ø.
The above properties meet two other characteristics of a gauge.

Remarks 2.1.1. Given closed sets {A,B,C, ...}= E, then a path set ϕ(E, EŒ)
exploring the distance of E to the closure (Œ) of E meets only open subsets, so
that ϕ(E, EŒ) = Ø. This is consistent with a property of the Hausdorﬀ distance.
Similarly, given A,B c E, one can tentatively note:

inf x ∈ E{ϕ(A, {x}) ∩ E◦} 7→ dist Hausdorﬀ ({x}, A)

(4.3a)

as reported by Choquet (1984) or Tricot, 1999b);

supϕ{(A, B) ∩ E◦} 7→ dist Hausdorﬀ(A, B)

as reported by Tricot (1999b);

inf a∈A, b∈B ϕ{(a, b) ∩ E◦} 7→ dist(A ∧ B)

as reported by Choquet (1984) for a (E,d) metric space;

(4.3b)

(4.3c)

max{(A, B) ⊂ E|ΛE(A, B)} 7→ diam Hausdorﬀ(E)

(4.3d)

in all cases.

(v). ΛE(A, B) = ΛE(B, A) and ΛE({x, y}) = Ø ⇔ x = y. If the triangular inequality
condition is fulﬁlled, then ΛE(B, A) will meet all of the properties of a mathematical
distance.

(4.3e)

(5.1a)

(5.1b)

Λ(A, B) ∪ ΛE(B, C) may contain members of ΛE(A, C) since the latter are con-

tained in neighborhoods of A,B,C. Thus:

ΛE(A, C) = {∃B, (A ∩ B 6= Ø, C ∩ B 6= Ø), ΛE(A, C) ⊆ ΛE(A, B) ∪ ΛE(B, C)}.

This completes the proof of Proposition 2. 1.

2.1.2. The particular case of a totally ordered space

Let A and B be disjoint segments in space E. Let E be ordered by the classical

relations:

A ⊂ B ⇔ A ≺ B,

(A, B) ⊂ ⇔ E ≻ A, E ≻ B.

Then, E is totally ordered if any segment owns a inﬁmum and a supremum.
Therefore, a distance (d) between A and B is represented as illustrated by Figure 2
by the following relation:

d(A, B) ⊆ dist(inf A, inf B) ∩ dist(supA, supB)

(5.2)

with the distance evaluated through either classical forms or even the set-distance
∆(A,B) which will be revisited below.

2.1.3. The case of topological spaces

Proposition 2.1. A space can be subdivided in two main classes: objects and
distances.

The set-distance is the symmetric diﬀerence between sets:

it has been proved
that it owns all the properties of a true distance (Bounias and Bonaly, 1996) and that
it can be extended to manifolds of sets (Bounias, 1997). In a topologically closed
space, these distances are the open complementary of closed intersections called the
”instans”. Since the intersection of closed sets is closed and the intersection of sets
with nonequal dimensions is always closed (Bounias and Bonaly, 1994), the instans
rather stands for closed structures. Since the latter have been shown to reﬂect
physical-like properties, they denote objects. Then, the distances as being their
complementaries will constitute the alternative class: thus, a physical-like space
may be globally subdivided into objects and distances as full components. This
coarse classiﬁcation will be further reﬁned in Part 2.

The properties of the set-distance allows an important theorem to be now stated.

Theorem 2.1.2. Any topological space is metrizable as provided with the set-
distance (∆) as a natural metrics. All topological spaces are kinds of metric spaces
called ”delta-metric spaces”.

Proof. Conditions for a space X (generally belonging to the set of parts of a space
W) to be a topological space are three folds (Bourbaki, 1990): (i) Any union of sets
belonging to X belongs to X. If A and B belong to X, then ∆(A, B) = ∁A∪B(A∩B) ⊆
(A ∪ B) ⊂ X; (ii) Any ﬁnite intersection of sets belonging to X belongs to X. Let

10

(A,B) ∈ X. Since max∆(A, B) = (A ∪ B) and min∆(A, B) = Ø, and that Ø ∈ X
(Schwartz, 1991), then necessarily (A, B) ∈ X. The symmetric distance fulﬁlls the
triangular inequality, including in its generalized form, it is empty if A = B = ..., and
it is always positive otherwise. It is symmetric for two sets and commutative for more
than two sets. Its norm is provided by the following relation : ||∆(A)|| = ∆(A, Ø).
Therefore, any topology provides the set-distance which can be called a topolog-
ical distance and a topological space is always provided with a self mapping of any
of its parts into any one metrics: thus any topological space is metrizable.

Reciprocally, given the set-distance, since it is constructed on the complementary
of the intersection of sets in their union, it is compatible with existence of a topology.
Thus, a topological space is always a ”delta-metric” space.

Remark 2.1.2. Distance ∆(A,B) is a kind of an intrinsic case [Λ(A,B)(A,B)] of
ΛE(A, B) while ΛE(A, B) is called a ”separating distance”. The separating distance
also stands for a topological metrics. Hence, if a physical space is a topological
space, it will always be measurable.

2.2. A corollary about intrinsic versus separating distances

2.2.1. Introduction

The previously proposed set distance as the symmetric diﬀerence between two
or more sets is independent of any embedding space. It should thus be considered
as an intrinsic one. However, the measure based on a path provided with a gauge
pertaining to the common ﬁlter on A,B in E seeks for an identiﬁcation of what is
between A and B within E. Thus, a particular application can be raised :

2.2.2. Results

Proposition 2.2. Let spaces (A,B) ⊂ E. Then a measure of the separating distance
of A and B is deﬁned if there exists a space X with nonempty intersections with E,
A, B, such that, X belongs to the same ﬁlter F as A and B, and

ΛE(A, B) : E ∩ {∆(A, X) ∩ ∆(B, X)}

(6)

Preliminary proof. Since ﬁlter F holds on E, and A,B∈ F the three properties of a
ﬁlter state the following (Bourbaki, 1990b, 1.36):

11

Figure 3: The symmetric diﬀerence (∆) between two or more sets provides a kind of dis-
tance which is consistent with a topology. This distance therefore stands for a topological
distance and provides topological spaces with a general form of metrics. By this way, any
topological space may be treated like a (delta-) metric space.

(i) X ∈ F implies X must contain a set G ∈ F ;
(ii) Since any ﬁnite intersection of sets of F must belong to F , one has:
G ∈ {Ai, Aj ∈ F , i 6= j : Ai ∩ Aj};
(iii) The empty part of X does not belong to F . Therefore since G ∈ X and
A ∩ B = Ø, then there must be G ∈ A ∩ X and G ∈ B ∩ X, G 6= Ø, which proves
(4.1).

Hence, this example (Fig. 3) further provides evidence that a deﬁnition is just a
particular conﬁguration of the intersection of two spaces of magmas of which one is
the reasoning system (eventually a logic) and the other one is a probationary space.

2.2.3. Particular case: measuring open sets

As pointed above, even a continued path cannot in general scan a open com-
ponent of the separating distance between two sets, since a path has in general
no closed intersection with a open with same dimension. This is consistent with
the exclusion of open adjoined intervals in the Borel measure. Hence, since a pri-
mary topology is a topology of open sets, a primary topological space cannot be a
physically measurable space.

However, an intersection of a closed (C) with a path (ϕ) having a nonequal
dimension than (C) owns a closed intersection with C provided this intersection is
nonempty. This implies that the general conditions of ﬁlter membership is fulﬁlled
(Fig. 4).

Remark. An open 3-D universe would not be scanned by a 3-D probe. But in a
closed Poincar´e section, the topologies are distributed into closed parts and their
complementaries as open subparts. Therefore, there may be open parts in our
universe that would not be detectable by 3-D probes. This problem might be linked
with the still pending problem of the missing dark matter (see also Arkani-Hamed,
2000).

12

Figure 4: A path scanning the separating part between a closed space A and another
closed space B must own a nonempty intersection with the objects situated between A
and B. Sets A and G and sets B and G own their symmetric diﬀerence as an intrinsic
set-distance. The intersection of these two measures is the separating distance.

A set Q having empty intersection with either A or B (here with B) does not pro-
vide a separating distance since it does not necessarily fulﬁll the embedding space with
connectivity. In this case, ∆(A, B, Q) = ∆(A, Q) ∪ ∆(B, Ø).

2.2.4. An alternative perspective

Owing to the case in which there exists no intersection of spaces A and B with
one of the other spaces contained in E, in order to deﬁne a common surrounding of
A and B in an appropriate region of E, the following proposition would hold:

Proposition 2.2.1. A ”surrounding distance” of spaces A and B in an embedding
space E is given by the complementary of A and B in the interior of their common
closure. This distance is noted @E(A, B):

@E(A, B) =

{(A, B)◦}E\(A ∪ B)
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

⊃ {A} ∪ {B}.

(7)

Corollary 2.2.1. A condition for the surrounding distance to be non-zero, is that
A and B must be dense in E.

The closure of A ∪ B is diﬀerent from, and contains, the union of the respective
closures of A and B. This important property clearly delimitates a region of space
E where any object may have to be scanned through a common gauge in order to
allow a measure like AE(A,B) to be allowed. Hence, the concept of surrounding
distance is more general since it induces that of separating distance and belongs to
a coarser topological ﬁlter.

2.3. About dimensionality studies

A collection of scientiﬁc observation through experimental devices produce im-
ages of some reality, and these images are further mapped into mental images into
the experimentalist’s brain (Bounias, 2000a). The information from the explored

13

space thus stands like parts of an apparatus being spread on the worker’s table, in
view of a further reconstitution of the original object. We propose to call this sit-
uation an informational display, likely composed of elements with dimension lower
than or equal to the dimension of the real object.

The next sections will thus deal with this particular problem.

2.3.1. Analysis of unordered versus ordered pairs in an abstract set

A robust deﬁnition of a ordered n-uple is given by the following:

Lemma 2.3. An expression noted (abc...z) is a ordered n-uple iﬀ:

(abc...z) = (x1 x2 x3 ...xn) ⇔ a = x1, b = x2, c = x3, ..., z = xn.

(8.1a)

In the construction of the set N of natural integers, Von Neumann provided an

equipotent form using replicates of Ø:

0 = Ø, 1 = {Ø}, 2 = {Ø, {Ø}}, 3 = {Ø, {Ø}, {Ø, {Ø}}},

4 = {Ø, {Ø}, {Ø, {Ø}}, {Ø, {Ø}, {Ø, {Ø}}}}, ...

A Von Neumann set is Mirimanoﬀ-ﬁrst kind since it is isomorphic with none of
its parts. However this construction, associated with the application of Morgan’s
laws to (Ø), allowed the empty set to be attributed an inﬁnite descent of inﬁnite
descents and thus to be classiﬁed as a member of the hypersets family (Bounias and
Bonaly, 1997b).

Proposition 2.3.1. In a ordered pair {{x},{x,y}}, the paired part {x,y} is un-
ordered.

A classical acceptance (Schwartz, 1991) states that {a,a} = {a}. This may

introduce a confusion which can then be treated from relation (5.1a) :

(aa) = (xy) ⇔ a = x, a = y.

(8.1b)

This just means that for any x,y, a pair (a,a) is not ordered. In eﬀect, it becomes
ordered upon rewriting: A = (a, (a, a)). Comparing (aa) and A through relation
(8.1a), it comes: (aa) = {a, {a, a}} ⇔ a = a, and a={a,a}.

(Q.E.D.)

Thus: {a,b} = {b,a}, while (ab) 6= (ba) and [{a, a} = a] 6= [{a, (a)} = (a, a)]
where (a) is a part, for which a ∪ (a) 6= {a} ∪ {a}. Consequently: (b,a) = (a,b) and
(a,a) = !(a,a).

In a abstract set (in the sense of a set of any composition), one can ﬁnd parts
with nonempty intersections as well as parts or members with no common members.
For instance, the following E and F are respectively without order and at least partly
ordered:

E = {a, b, {c, d}, G, X} with a 6= b, c 6= d, G 6= X,

F = {a, b, c, {a, d}, {b, c, d}, {d, {a, e, f}}}.

(8.2)

(8.3)

In particular cases, in a set like E or F, it may be that two singletons, e.g. {a},
{b}, though diﬀerent, have the same weight with respect to a deﬁned property. In
such case one could write that there exists some (m) such that {a} ≡ {m} and
{b} ≡ {m}, so that {a, d, G} ∩ {c, {b, c}, } = (a ≡ b).

14

Proposition 2.3.2. An abstract set can be provided with at least two kinds of
orders : one with respect to identiﬁcation of a max and or a min, and one with respect
to ordered N-uples. These two order relations become equivalent upon additional
conditions on the nature of involved singletons.

2.3.2 (i). A Mirimanof set of the (2.2) type and derived forms can be provided
a order. Let E = {e, {f,G}}. Then as seen above, there exists some m such that
{e} ≡ {f} ≡ {m}, and E is similar to E′ ≡ {m, {m, G}}. Then, for any G 6= Ø,
m ⊂ {m, G} and thus m is a minimal member of {m,G}. Pose {m, G} = M, then
E′ becomes E′′ = {m, M} of which m is the minimal and M is the maximal of
the set. Then, one can rewrite {m, {m, G}} in the alternative form {m, (m, G)} and
E = {e, (f, G)} since (f,G) is in some sort ordered. These notations will be respected
below. Note that ∠(f, G) ⇒ ∃{f, {G}} while the reciprocal is not necessarily true.
The necessary condition is the following.

Suppose {f, {G}} ⇒ ∃{f, {G}}. Then, since {f, {G}} = {{G}, f}, one should be
allowed to write f ≡ G and G ≡ f, that is, there is neither minimal nor maximal in
the considered part. Now, writing (f,G) imposes as a necessary condition that there
exists some m and n such that (f, G) ≡ {m, {m, n}} = {m, {n, m}}. This can then
be (but only speculatively) turned into a virtual (m,(m,n)). When comparing two
sets, parts ordered by this way will have to be compared two by two: {e, {f, G}} =
{m, (n, Z)} ⇒ e = m, and since m 6= M : f = n, G = Z (otherwise {f, g} = (n, z)
could give alternatively f=z, n=g).

This drives the problem to the identiﬁcation of orders in the set of parts of a set,

as compared with components of a simplex set (Table 1).

2.3.2 (ii). A set can be ordered through rearrangement of its exact members and
singletons in a way permitted by the structure of the set of parts of itself. In eﬀect,
existence of a set axiomatically provides existence to the set of its parts (Bourbaki,
p. 30) though an axiom of availability has been shown to be required for disposal
of the successive sets of parts of sets of parts (Bounias, 2001).

Now, how to identify preordered pairs in a set? The set of parts P(E) of a set E
provides the various ways members of this set can be gathered in subsets, still not
ordered. Therefore, an analysis of the members of a set can involve a rearrangements
of the singletons contained in the set in a way permitted by the arrangements allowed
by P(E), including when a same singleton is present several times in the set. Then,
this may let emerge conﬁgurations that can be identiﬁed with a structure of ordered
n-uples.

Remark 2.2.
In n-uples as well as in the set of parts, singletons gathered in
any subpart are unordered. Call (E′) a set reordered by using P(E). Then: E′ ∩
P(E) =Partition(E).

Application to simplicial structures

Table 1 illustrates for the ﬁrst four simplexes, the comparison of the ordered pairs
of the simplexes with the remaining part of the set of parts, which is constituted of
(2N − N − 1) unordered nonempty members for a simplex of N vertices.

In ﬁne, a fully informative measure should provide a picture of a space allowing
its set component to be depicted in terms of ordered N-uples (N = 0 → n, n ⊂ N).
These considerations are intended to apply when a batch of observational data
and measurement are displayed in a scattered form on the laboratory table of a
scientist, and must then be reconstructed in a way most likely representative of a
previously unknown reality.

2.3.3. Identiﬁcation of a ”scanning” measure on an abstract set

Several kinds of measure of a set, including various forms of its diameter infer

from section 2.1 above.

Proposition 2.3.3. A set can be scanned by the composition of a identity function
with a diﬀerence function. Let E = {a,b,c,...} a set having N members.

(i) An identity function Id maps any members of E into itself: ∀x ∈ E, Id(x) = x.

Thus, ∠(a, or b, or c, ...) this provides one and only one response when applied

to E.

16

(ii) A diﬀerence function is f such that: ∀x ∈ E, f n(x) 6= x.

The exploration function is a self-map M of E: M : E 7→ E, M = Id ⊥ f :

∠x ∈ E, M(x) = f (Id(x)), ∀n : Mn(x) = f n(Id(x)) 6= x.

(9.1)

Proof. (a) Suppose M = Id(x); then, each trying maps a member of E to a ﬁxed
point and there is no possible scanning of E. (b) Suppose one poses just f (Id(x)) 6= x;
then, given f (Id(x)) 6= x, say f 1(Id(x) = y, since y 6= x, then one may have again
f 2(Id(x)) = x. Therefore, there can be a loop without further scanning of E, with
probability (N − l)1. (c) Suppose one poses M = f , such that f (x) 6= x. Then,
since f 0(x) 6= x, there can be no start of the scanning process. If in contrast one
poses as a modiﬁcation of the function f that ∠x, f 0(x) = x, this again stops the
exploration process, since then f 0 ∈ Id. This has been shown to provide a minimal
indecidability case (Bounias, 2001).

The sequence of functions Mn(x) = f n(Id(x))) 6= x, ∀n, is thus necessary and
suﬃcient to provide a measure of E which scans N-l members of E. The sequence
stops at the Nth iterate if in addition:

f n(Id(x)) 6= {f i(Id(x))}∀ i ∈ [1,N].

(9.2)

The described sequence represents an example of a path as described above in

more general terms.

Now, some preliminary kinds of diameters can be tentatively deduced for the
general case of a set E in which neither a complete structure nor a total order can
be seen.

2.3.4. Tentative evaluations of the size of sets with ill-deﬁned structure
and order

Since in this case any two members of E are of similar weight, regarding the

deﬁnition of a diameter (4.3d), it can be proposed the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.3.1a. Given a non-ordered set E, Id the identity self map of E, and f
the diﬀerence self map of E, a kind of diameter is given by the following relation:

diam f(E) ≈ {(x, y) ∈ E : max f i(Id(x)) ∩ max f i(Id(y)}.

(10.1)

This gives a (N-2) members parameter.

If E is well-ordered, i.e. at least one, e.g.

Subdeﬁnition. 2.3.2b.
the lower
boundary can be identiﬁed among members of E, such as a singleton {m}, then an
alternative form can be written. Since in this case, the set E can be represented by
two members: E = {m, Z} with Z = ∁ E(m) the complementary of m in E, relation
(4.3d) results in a measure M H∆:

M H∆(E) = {m = min(E), ∆(m, Z)}

(10.2)

with ∆ the symmetric diﬀerence.

17

Figure 5: A preliminary approach of the diameter of an abstract set in a partly ordered
space: this examples allows the sup(diamE) as included in the complementary of c and d
in E.

This gives a (N-l) member parameter which in turn provides a derived kind of
diameter diam H∆ by repeating the measure for two members m′ and m′′ as on Figure
4. Let E′ = {m′, ∁E(m′)}, and E′′ : {∁E(m′′)}, then (Fig. 5):

diam(E) ⊆ {m′, m′′ ∈ E : max ∆(E′, E′′)}.

(10.3)

Subdeﬁnition 2.3.1c. If both upper and lower boundaries can be identiﬁed, i.e.
the set E is totally ordered, then the distance separating two segments A and B of
E is :

(A, B) ⊂ E, distE(A, B) = {dist(inf A, inf B) ∩ dist(supA, supB)}

(10.4)

where a set distance ∆ is again provided by the symmetric diﬀerence or by a n-D
Borel measure.

A separating distance is a extrinsic form of the set-distance as an intrinsic form.
A diameter is evaluated on E as the following limit:

diam(E) = {inf A → inf E, sup A → min E,

inf B → max E, sup B → sup E | lim dist E (A, B)}

(10.5)

These preliminary approaches allow the measure of the size of tessellatting balls
as well as that of tessellatted spaces, with reference to the calculation of their dimen-
sion through relations (2.1)-(2.2) and (11.1)-(11.2) derived below. A diagonal-like
part of an abstract space can be identiﬁed with and logically derived as, a diameter.

Remark 2.3.1. Each time a measure if obtained from a system, this means that
no absolutely empty part is present as an adjoined segment on the trajectory of the
exploring path. Thus, no space accessible to some sort of measure is strictly empty
in a both mathematical and physical sense, which supports the validity of the quest
of quantum mechanics for a structure of the void.

2.3.5. The dimension of an abstract space: tessellatting with simplex
k-faces

A major goal in physical exploration will be to discern among detected objects
which ones are equivalent with abstract ordered N-uples within their embedding
space.

A ﬁrst of further coming problems is that in a space composed of members
identiﬁed with such abstract components, it may not be found tessellatting balls
all having identical diameter. Also a ball with two members would have no such
diameter as deﬁned in (10.1) or (10.4). Thus a measure should be used as a probe
for the evaluation of the coeﬃcient of size ratio (p) needed for the calculation of a
dimension.

Some preliminary proposed solutions hold on the following principles.

(i). A 3-object has dimension 2 iﬀ given A1
for the triangular strict inequality, where M denotes an appropriate measure:

max its longer side fulﬁlls the condition,

Similarly, this condition can be extended to higher dimensions (Fig. 6):

M(A1

max) < M(A1

2) + M(A1

(11.1c)

Then, more generally for a space X being a N object:

with N = number of vertices, i.e. eventually of members in X, k = (d − 1) = N − 2,
and Ak
max the k-face with maximum size in X. This supports a former proposition
(Bounias, 2001).
Remark 2.3.2. One should note that, according to relation (11.1c), for N = 2 (a
”2-object”), X = {x1, x2} has dimension 1 iﬀ x1 < (x1 + x2), that is iﬀ x1 < x2
(Fig. 5). This qualiﬁes the lower state of an existing space X1.

19

(ii). Let now space X be decomposed into the union of balls represented by D-faces
AD proved to have dimension Dim (AD) = D by relation (11.1c) and size M(A1)
for a 1-face. Such a D-face is a D-simplex Sj whose size, as a ball, is evaluated by
M(A1
max)D = SjD. Let N is the number of such balls that can be ﬁlled in a space H,
so that

N

{SjD} ⊆ (H ≈ Ld

(11.2a)

with H being identiﬁed with a ball whose size would be evaluated by Ld, L is the size
of a 1-face of H, and d the dimension of H. Then, if ∀ Sj, Sj ≈ So, the dimension of
H is:

Dim(H) ≈ (D · Log So + Log N )/ Log L1

max.

(11.2b)

Remark. Relation (11.2b) stands for a kind of interior measure in the Jordan’s
sense. In contrast, if one poses that the reunion of balls covers the space H, then,
Dim(H) rather represents the capacity dimension, which remains an evaluation of a
fractal property.

Deﬁnition 2.3.2b. A n-(simplex-ball) is the topological unit ball circumscribed to
a n-simplex.

(iii). Extension to a ill-deﬁned space E.

The problem consists in identifying ﬁrst a 1-face component of E from k-faces
(k > l), which implies to identify ordered N-uples. Then, components of E, whatever
their nature, should be analogically decomposed into appropriate simplexes. The
number of these simplexes will then be evaluated in E, and relations (11.2) will be
ﬁnally applied.

Remark. There is no other condition on simplexes Sj than the need that one
face is maximal: this is the face on which the others will be projected, so that the
generalized inequality will be applied.

Depending on N , noninteger d(H) can be obtained for a fractal or a fractal-like
H. Some applications of the above protocol will be illustrated in further communi-
cations.

Lemma 2.3. A singleton or member (a) is putatively available in the form of a
self-similar ordered n-uple: {a} = {a ∩ a ∩ ... ∩ a}h 6= {(a, (a), ...}.

In eﬀect, the set theory axiom of the reunion states that A ∪ A = A as well as

the axiom of the intersection states that A ∩ A = A.

Corollary 2.3. In the analysis of a abstract space H = Lx, of which dimension
x is unknown, the identiﬁcation of which members can be identiﬁed with N-uples
supposedly coming from a putative Cartesian product of members of H, e.g.: G ⊂ H:
∠a ∈ G, (aaa...a)h ∈ Gh, is allowed by an anticipatory process.
Preliminary proof. At time (t) of the analysis of the formal system involved, there
is no recurrent function that can ”imagine” the existence of an abstract component
not existing in the original data and parameters, and not directly inferring from a
computation of these data and parameters. Devising (aaa...a)h ∈ Gh, implies making
a mental image at (t + te) and further confronting the behavior of the system with

20

”anticipatively recurrent” images succeeding to those at t, that is computed from
(t, t + e) conditions within (t+1, t+2, ..., up to t + e − 1).

Let E = {a, {b, {, B, C}}}; then one anticipates on the putative existence of a

unordered pair {a, a} = a in a former writing of E.

Therefore, (a) =

{a, {a, a}}|{a, a} = {a}

. The presence of singletons can be
identiﬁed with a putative former reduction of ordered parts owning the same nucleus
(a). A nucleus thus appears as a ordered form of a singleton, that is the only case
where a ordered form is identical with a unordered one.

An example is given in Appendix as a tentative application case. Regarding just
a Cartesian product, the set of parts with empty or minimal intersections stands for
the diagonal and the diagonal of a polygon stands for a topological diameter.

3. Physical inferences

3.1. Deﬁning a probationary space

A probationary space (Bounias, 2001) is deﬁned as a space fulﬁlling exactly
the conditions required for a property to hold, in terms of : (i) identiﬁcation of
set components (ii) identiﬁcation of combinations of rules (iii) identiﬁcation of the
reasoning system. All these components are necessary to provide the whole system
with decidability (Bounias, 2001). Since lack of mathematical decidability inevitably
ﬂaws also any physical model derived from a mathematical background, our aim is
to access as close as possible to these imposed conditions in a description of both
a possible and a knowable universe, in order to reﬁne in consequence some current
physical postulates.

The above considerations have raised a set of conditions needed for some knowl-
edge to be gettable about a previously unknown or ill-known space, upon pathwise
exploration from a perceiving system A to a target space B within an embedding
space B.

In the absence of preliminary postulate about existence of so-called ”matter”
and related concepts, it has been demonstrated that the existence of the empty set
is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of abstract mathematical
spaces (Wn) endowed with topological dimensions (n) as great as needed (Bounias
and Bonaly, 1997). Hence, the empty set appears as a set without members though
containing empty parts. The reasoning intermediately proved that the empty set
owns the properties of a nonwellfounded set and exhibit (i) self-similarity at all scales
and (ii) nowhere derivability, that is : two characteristics of fractal structures. These
properties have been shown to clear up some antinomies remained unaddressed about
the empty set properties.

21

These ﬁndings will now be shown to provide additional features of physical inter-
est. In ﬁrst, the empty set can provide at least an intellectual support to existence
of some sort of space.

3.2. The founding element

It is generally assumed in textbooks of mathematics (see for instance Schwartz,
1991, p. 24), that some set does exist. This strong postulate has been reduced to
a weaker form reduced to the axiom of the existence of the empty set (Bounias and
Bonaly, 1997). It has been shown that providing the empty set (Ø) with (∈, ⊂) as
the combination rules (that is also with the property of complementarity (∁)) results
in the deﬁnition of a magma allowing a consistent application of the ﬁrst Morgan’s
law without violating the axiom of foundation iﬀ the empty set is seen as a hyperset,
that is a nonwellfounded set (Aczel, 1987, Barwise, 1991). A further support of this
conclusion emerges from the fact that several paradoxes or inconsistencies about the
empty set properties are solved (Bounias and Bonaly, 1997). These preliminaries
now drive us to the formulation of the following theorem which will be established
using several Lemmas.

3.3. The founding lattice

Theorem 3.3.1. The magma ØØ = {Ø, ∁} constructed with the empty hyperset
and the axiom of availability is a fractal lattice.

Remark. The notation ØØ has been prefered to -say- (EØ) or others. In eﬀect, in
Bourbaki notation, EF means the space of functions of set F in set E. Therefore,
writing (ØØ) denotes that the magma reﬂects the set of all self-mappings of (Ø),
which emphasizes the forthcoming results.

Lemma 3.3.1. The space constructed with the empty set cells of EØ is a Boolean
lattice.

Proof. (i) Let ∪(Ø) = S denote a simple partition of (Ø). Suppose that there
exists an object (ε) included in a part of S, then necessarily (ε) = Ø and its belongs
(ii) Let P = {Ø, Ø} denote a part bounded by sup P = S
to the partition.
and inf P = {Ø}. The combination rules ∪ and ∩ provided with commutativity,
associativity and absorption are holding. In eﬀect: Ø ∪ Ø = Ø, Ø ∩ Ø = Ø and thus
necessarily Ø ∪ (Ø ∩ Ø) = Ø, Ø ∩ (Ø ∪ Ø) = Ø. Thus, space {(P (Ø), (∪, ∩)} is a
lattice.

The null member is Øand the universal member is 2 Ø that should be denoted
by ℵ Ø. Since in addition, by founding property ∁ Ø(Ø) = Ø, and the space of (Ø) is
distributive, then S(Ø) is a Boolean lattice.

(Q.E.D.)

Lemma.3.3.2. S(Ø) is provided with a topology of discrete space.

Proof. (i) The lattice S(Ø) owns a topology. In eﬀect, it is stable upon union and
ﬁnite intersection, and its contains (Ø).
(ii) Let S(Ø) denote a set of closed units. Two units Ø1, Ø2 separated by a unit Ø3
compose a part {Ø1, Ø2, Ø3}. Then, owing to the fact that the complementary of
a closed is a open: ∁ {Ø1, Ø2, Ø3} {Ø1, Ø3} = Ø2, and Ø2 is open. Thus, by recurrence,

22

{Ø1, Ø3} are surrounded by open ]Ø[ and in parts of these open, there exists distinct
neigborhoods for (Ø1) and (Ø3). The space S(Ø) is therefore Hausdorﬀ separated.
Units (Ø) formed with parts thus constitute a topology (TØ) of discrete space. In-
deed, it also contains the discrete topology (ØØ, (Ø)), which is the coarse one and
is of much less mathematical interest.

Lemma 3.3.3. The magma of empty hyperset is endowed with self-similar ratios.
The von Neumann notation associated with the axiom of availability, applying
on (Ø), provide existence of sets (NØ) and (QØ) equipotent to the natural and the
rational numbers (Bounias and Bonaly, 1997). Sets Q and N can thus be used for
the purpose of a proof. Consider a Cartesian product En × En of a section of (QØ)
of n integers. The amplitude of the available intervals range from 0 to n, with
two particular cases: interval [0,1] and any of the minimal intervals [1/n − l, 1/n].
Consider now the open section ]0,1[: it is an empty interval, noted Ø1. Similarly,
note Ømin =]0, l/n(n−l)[. Since interval [0, l/n(n−l)] is contained in [0,1], it follows
that Ømin ⊂ Ø1. Since empty sets constitute the founding cells of the lattice S(Ø)
proved in Lemma 4.1, the lattice is tessellatted with cells (or balls) with homothetic-
like ratios of at least r = n(n − l). The absence of unﬁlled areas will be further
supported in Part 2 of this study by introduction of the ”set with no parts”.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Such a lattice of tessellattion balls will be called a ”tessellattice”.

Lemma 3.3.4. The magma of empty hyperset is a fractal tessellattice.

Proof. (i) From relations (2.3) one can write (Ø) ∪ (Ø) = (Ø, Ø) = (Ø). (ii) It is
straightforward that (Ø) ∩ (Ø) = (Ø). (iii) Last, the magma (ØØ) = {Ø, ∁} repre-
sents the generator of the ﬁnal structure, since (Ø) acts as the ”initiator polygon”,
and complementarity as the rule of construction. These three properties stand for
the major features which characterize a fractal object (James and James, 1990).

Finally, the axiom of the existence of the empty set, added with the axiom of
availability in turn provide existence to a lattice S(Ø) that constitutes a discrete
fractal Hausdorﬀ space, and the proof is complete.

3.4. Existence and nature of spacetime

Lemma 3.4.2. A lattice of empty sets can provide existence to a at least physical-
like space.

Proof. Let Ø denote the empty set as a case of the whole structure, and {Ø} denotes
It has been shown that the set of parts of Ø contains parts
some of its parts.
equipotent to sets of integers, of rational and of real numbers, and owns the power
of continuum (Bounias and Bonaly, 1994,1997). Then, looking at the infering spaces
(Wn), (Wm), ... thus formed, it has been proved (Bounias and Bonaly, 1994) that
the intersections of such spaces having nonequal dimensions give raise to spaces
containing all their accumulation points and thus forming closed sets. Hence:

{(W n) ∩ (W m)}m>n = (Θ n) is closed space.

(12)

These spaces provide collections of discrete manifolds whose interior is endowed
with the power of continuum. Consider a particular case (Θ 4) and the set of its
parts P(Θ n); then any of intersections of subspaces (E d) d<4 provides a d-space in

23

which the Jordan-Veblen theorem allows closed members to get the status of both
observable objects and perceiving objects (Bounias and Bonaly, 1997b). This stands
for observability, which is a condition for a space to be in some sort observable, that
is physical-like (Bonaly’s conjecture, 1992).

Finally,

in any (Θ 4) space, the ordered sequences of closed intersections
{(E d) d<4}, with respect to mappings of members of {(E d) d<4}i into {(E d) d<4}j,
provides an orientation accounting for the physical arrow of time (Bounias, 2000a),
in turn embedding an irreversible arrow of biological time (Bounias, 2000b). Thus
the following proposition:

Proposition 3.4.1. A manifold of potential physical universes is provided by the
(Θ n) category of closed spaces.

Our spacetime is one of the mathematically optimum ones, together with the
alternative series of {(W3) ∩ (Wm)}in>3. Higher spacetimes (Θ n) n > 3 could exist
as well.

Now it will be brieﬂy examined some new structures which can pertain to a

topological space as described above, and deserves speciﬁc attention.

4. Towards ”fuzzy dimension” and ”beaver spaces”

Introduction

The exploration of nature raises the existence of strange objects, such as living
organisms, whose anatomy suggests that mathematical objects having adjoined parts
with each having diﬀerent dimensions could exist. This will then introduce the idea
that the dimensions of some objects may even not be completely established. The
existence of
such strange objects implies that appropriate tools should be prepared for their
eventual study. This is sketched here and will be matter of further developments.

4.1. From hairy spaces to ”beaver spaces”

A ”hairy space” is a (n > 3)-ball having 1-D lines (also called ”hair” of ”grass”)
planted on it (Berger, 1990). It is interesting that for such spaces (n > 3 only), the
volume and the area do not change with the insertion of 1-spaces on them.

Let a simplex Sn

n: the last segment allowing set E n+1 to be completed from En of
S n−1 is (x n, x n+). Consider the simplex F n−1 such that one of its facets An−2 has its
last segment (y n−1, y n−2) ≡ (x n, x n+1). Repeat this operation for descending values:
one gets a space having n- and (n − l)-adjoined parts with their intersections having
lower dimension: Dim{S n ∩ S n−1} ≤ (n − 2). With respect to a beaver, having a
spherical body, with a ﬂat tail surrounded with hair, these spaces will be denoted as
”beaver spaces”. Other possibilities include not ordered appositions of parts with
various dimensions.

The existence of Beaver spaces implies some speciﬁc adjustment of the methods
used for their scanning. In this respect, it should be recalled that a new mode of
assessment of coordinates has been formerly proposed (Bounias and Bonaly, 1996):

24

it consists in studying the intersection of the unknown space with a probe composed
with an ordered sequence of topological balls of decreasing dimensions, down to a
point (D = 0). This process has been shown to wear the advantage of being able to
deﬁne coordinates even in a fractal space. This may be of particular interest with
components provided by and embedded in the lattice S(Ø).

4.2. ”Fuzzy dimensionned” spaces

Proposition 4. There exists spaces with fuzzy dimensions.

Proof. Let a simplex S n
n = {(E n+), (⊥ n)}, and its two characteristic structures,
and U1
namely L1
dist(x i−1, xi)
n =
. Then,
a condition for the assessment of simplicial dimensionality is given by the structure
deﬁning a simplicial space (Bounias, 2001) in consistency with a (1 − D)-probe for
a (D > l)-space:

dist(x i+1, xi)

P i=1→n (cid:0)

P i=1→n (cid:0)

n+1 =

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

(⊥ n) = (U1

n+1 > k(n, d) · L1

n ⇔ d > n).

(13)

Let the last segment of the simplex (xn, xn+1) be such that, in consistency with
Zadeh and Kacprzyk (1992), one has: dist(xn, xn+1) ∈ [0, 1]. Then, the expression
of U1
n+1 reaches a value fuzzily situated between the assessment of D = n − 1 and
D = n at least for n < 4. Thus, the simplicial set En+1 is of the fuzzy type and the
simplex is a fuzzy simplex.

Such a space will therefore be said as having a ”fuzzy dimension”. This provides a
particular extension of the concept of fuzzy set into that of ”fuzzy space of magma”,
since the set is unchanged while it is the rule that provides the magma with a fuzzy
structure.

These problems will be the matter of further developments, since they belong
to the kind of situations that could really be encountered during the exploration
of universe, and as pointed by Klir and Wierman (1999): ”Knowledge about the
outcome of an uncertain event gives the possessor an advantage”.

5. Discussion

5.1. Epistemological assessment

It has been stressed in the introduction that computable systems can in principle
not be self-evaluated, due to incompleteness and indecidability theorems. It will be
shown here on a simple example why this does not apply to the self-evaluation of
our universe structure by one of its components, when this component is a living
subpart provided with conscious perception functions, that is a brain.

Theorem 5. A world containing subparts endowed with consciously perceptive
brains is a self-evaluable system.

The proof will be founded on two main Lemmas.

Lemma 5.1. There exists a minimal indecidable system (Bounias, 2001).

Proof. The former theorem of Godel provided the most sophisticated proof, while the
systems devised by Chaitin described the most giant examples of known indecidable
systems. In contrast, a recurrent reasoning would state that there should exist most

25

simpler cases. Consider the set E = {(A)} where (A) is a part, eventually composed
of nuclei or singletons. Try an exploration of E by itself: without prior knowledge of
the inside structure of E, the exploration function f n(Id(x)) described in relations
(2.3.1–2.3.5). Applying this function to E, one gets Id(A) = A and f n(A) 6= A does
not exists from the deﬁnitions (this applies to A = {a} a singleton, as well). Hence,
the system returns no result: not a zero result, but litterally no answer. Now, let
A be composed of singletons, the same procedure must be applied to each detected
for any singleton {Ø},
singleton, with the same failure. Finally, let A be (ØØ):
one will get Id(Ø) = Ø and f n(Ø) again returns no response. Hence, the lattice
S(0) is not self-evaluable as it stands at this stage. Since {Ø} is the minimum of
any nonempty set, the system stands for a minimum of an indecidable case of the
classical set theory (though a new component will be considered in Part 2).

Lemma 5.2. A consciously perceptive biological brain is endowed with anticipatory
properties (Bounias and Bonaly, 2001).

The function of conscious perception has been shown to infer from the same
conditions as those allowing a physical universe to exist from abstract mathematical
spaces: A path connecting a Jordan’s point of an outside closed B to the inside
of another closed A is prolonged in a biological brain into a sequence of neuronal
conﬁgurations which converges to ﬁxed points. These ﬁxed points stand for mental
images (Bounias and Bonaly, 1996; Bounias, 2000). The sequence of mental images
owns fractal properties which can provide additional help to the construction by
the brain of mental images of an expected future state. These mental images will
in turn be used as a guide for the adjustment of further actions to the expected
goal (Bounias, 2000), which is also a way by which the organism returns molecular
information to the brain, making unconscious (autonomous) mental images which
are used in turn for the control of the homeostasy of the organism.

Now, consider a space F = {(A), (B)} where (A) is a living system endowed with
anticipatory properties. Then, A is able to analyze some of its components (a1, a2,
...) through a way similar to the exploration function. By an anticipatory process,
it is able to construct the power set of parts P n of at least a part of (A) or (B).
Consequently, there will always be a step (n) in which P n, i.e. the set of parts of
the set of parts of ... (n times) the set of parts of part of (A) or (B) will have a
cardinality higher than (A) or (B), since (A) and (B) are ﬁnite and P n is inﬁnitely
denumerable. Then (A) will be able to construct a surjective map of P n on either
(A) or (B). This completes the proof.

5.2. About the assessment of probationary spaces

There remain enormous gaps in the present-day knowledge of what universe
could really be. For instance, current cosmological theories remain contradictive
with astronomical observation (Mitchell, 1995; Bucher and Spergel, 1999; Krauss,
1999 and many other articles). The inconsistency of Lorentz covariance used by
Einstein, Minkowski, Mach, Poincar´e, Maxwell etc. with Lorentz invariance used
by Dirac, Wigner, Feynman, Yang, etc.
remains unsolved (Arunasalam, 1997).
Quantum mechanics still failing to account for macroscopic phenomena, could be -
and has been -interpreted through classical physics (Wesley, 1995), while ﬂaws have
been found in so-called ”decisive experimental evidence” or classical observations

26

about as fundamental parameters as the Bell inequalities (Wesley, 1994), the velocity
of light (Driscoll, 1997), the red shift meaning (Meno, 1998), and others.

More, whether space is independent from matter or matter is deformation of
space remains questioned (Krasnoholovets, 1997; Kubel, 1997; Rothwarf, 1998).
These discrepancies essentially come from the fact that probationary spaces sup-
porting a number of explicit or implicit assessments have not been clearly identiﬁed.
At cosmological scales, the relativity theory places referentials in a undeﬁned
space, with undeﬁned gauges nor substrate for the transfer of information and the
support of interactions. That matter exists and is spread into this undeﬁned medium
is just implicitly admitted without justiﬁcations. Here, distances are postulated
without reference to objects.

At quantum scales, a probability that objects are present in a certain volume is
calculated. But again, nothing is assessed about what are these objects, and what
is their embedding medium in which such ”volumes” can be found. Furthermore,
whether these objects are of a nature similar or diﬀerent to the nature of their
In this case, objects are postulated
embedding medium has not been addressed.
without reference to distances.

About quantum levels, justiﬁcations have been mathematically produced in order
to cope with some unexplainable observations, but this does not constitute a proof,
per se, since the proof is not independent from the result to be supported. Last,
neither the Big Bang energy source nor others have been justiﬁed, which led to the
theory of an energy of the void: but then, this precludes existence of a true ”void”.
These remarks support the need for ﬁnding ultraﬁlter properties which would be
provided to any object and distance from microscopic to cosmic scales in our uni-
verse, assuming that it is not composed of separate component with discontinuity
nor break of arcwise connectivity.

The next part of this work will provide some logical answers to such problems
and derive physical properties of an infering spacetime, with particular reference to
the derivation of cosmic scale features from submicroscopic characteristics.

on the physicist’s table like detached parts.

Let (E e

n) = {aa, ba, ca, bc, ab, cc, ac, bb, cb}. Applying (11.3a) gives several
results such as: {a, b, bb, ca, cc, ab, ac} or {aa, cc, bb, ca, bc, b, a, }, etc. and
{aa, bb, cc}. Thus: diam(E e
n) ⊆ {aa, bb, cc} which matches with the diagonal of
the Cartesian product {a, b, c} × {a, b, c}. Then, applying (11.3b) gives either {Ø}

the size ratio is ̺ = 1/3 while the number of cobbles tesselating the set is 9. Hence,
applying either equations (2.1)–(2.2) or equations (11.2) gives 9 · (l/3)e = 1, that is,
e = ln 9/ ln 3 = 2, or e = (ln 9 + 2 ln 2)/ ln 6 = 2.

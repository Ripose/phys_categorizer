1 Introduction

The discovery of natural world around us is an indispensable activity of mankind. And
looking for a single theory that can explain every phenomenon and every process is a good
dream of scientists and especially physicists. Nowadays, physicists have been trying to
ﬁnd a single theory that uniﬁes four familiar interactions, and they hope that it develops
the theory of everything. A theory they believe to be the theory of everything is called
the superstring theory. Notably, it is necessary to understand that the superstring theory
gives us description which only can unite four familiar forces into a single framework.

Of course, whether it is really called the theory of everything or not since there are
many unknown interactions (besides four familiar interactions) absenting in the theory.
Moreover, the theory of everything must give us a correct solution in every phenomenon
and process (in all universe’s dimension, in all energy level, in all universe’s status and
so fourth). The theory of everything is necessarily a theory of Creation, that is, it must
necessarily explain everything from the origin of the Universe down to the lilies of the
ﬁeld. A theory of everything is also a theory of everyday. Thus, this theory, when fully
completed, will be able to explain the existence of every phenomenon, the variation of
every process, and many others.

However, there is another way on which we can reach the theory of everything. That
is to ﬁnd a single law that implies all known laws and, therefore, predicts unknown laws.
The presence of this law has in every phenomenon, process and thing in nature. It is
really to be the ultimate goal of all knowledge, the theory to end all theories, the ultimate
answer to all questions.

The present article is the ﬁrst one of a series that we would like to say about the
law and the theory of causality as well as its implementation for building a theory of the
Universe. We hope that some of the readers of this article will ﬁnd out that the law of
causality is just the law of all laws, the theory of causality is just the single theory of
everything, and perhaps they will be the ones to complete the quest for the Theory of the
Universe.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the ideas and concepts
for leading the equation of causality [1]. In Section 3, as the main part of the article, we
attempt to simulate brieﬂy the process of the Universe’s evolution [2]. The conclusions
and prospects are given in Section 4.

2 The Equation of Causality

We can always conceive that the Universe is in uniﬁcation. And a sureﬁre fact is that
the Universe’s uniﬁcation is only in a general intrinsic relationship which is nothing but
the relationship of causality, and the uniﬁcation only manifests itself in that causal form.
Then, a question is put on what is the ultimate cause of everything? On further reﬂection,
we ﬁnd out that there exists an ultimate cause - that is the diﬀerence.

2

Truly, there would not exist anything if there were not the diﬀerence. If there were
no diﬀerence, this world did not exist. And there is a fact that since the diﬀerence is the
ultimate cause, it is the cause of itself, in other words, it is also the eﬀect of itself. The
diﬀerence causes the diﬀerence, the diﬀerence is the corollary generated by the diﬀerence.
In another way, we can imagine abstractly that the Nature is a set of positive actions3
and negative actions4. Then, what does the Nature act positively on? and what does the
Nature act negatively on? The answer to these questions gives us a law. That is, what
do not have any intrinsic contradiction is acted positively on, what do have some intrinsic
contradiction is acted negatively on. Both the positive action (in front of a process) and
the negative action (in back of the process) have a ﬁnal goal that is to reach and to end
at a new action.

Thus, we have started to come to a theory, axiom of which is the diﬀerence, object of

which is actions5 [1].

Consider two actions, we obtain a deﬁnition that coexistence of two actions which

reject mutually generates contradiction. That is represented as follows:

M =

A 6= A
A = A

(cid:26)

− Action K1
− Action K2

.

This means the higher the power of mutual rejection between two actions K1and K2
is the more severe the contradiction M will be. And the power of mutual rejection of two
actions is estimated from the degree of diﬀerence. A contradiction which is solved means
that the diﬀerence of two actions diminishes to zero. Herein, two actions K1and K2 all
vary to reach and to end at a new action K3.

The change, and one kind of which - the variation, is generated by contradiction.
In exact words, the variation is the manifestation of contradiction solving. The more
severe contradiction becomes the more urgent need of solving out of contradiction will be,
and hence the more violent the change, the variation of the state, i.e. of contradiction
will become. Call the violence, or the quickness of the variation of contradiction Q, the
contradiction state is M, the above principle can be represented as follows:

Q = K(M )M

where K(M ) is means to solve the contradiction M. K(M ) can be a function of the contra-
diction state. It represents the degree of easiness to escape the contradiction state. If the
contradiction is characterized by quantities x, y, z, ..., these quantities themselves will be
facilities to transport the contradiction, degrees of freedom over which the contradiction
is solved. Hence, the degree of easiness is valued as the derivative of the contradiction
with respect to its degree of freedom

K(M ) ∼ |M ′(x, y, z, ...)| .

3Positive action means ’aﬃrmation’.
4Negative action means ”negative’.
5Action here is a general concept of anything, it may be a function, a generator, an operator, or even

a force, an interaction, a ﬁeld, ect. depending on each considered subject.

3

Thus,

Thus,

Q = a |M ′| M

where the coeﬃcient a generates from choosing the dimension.

Advance a quantity T , inverse of Q, to be stagnancy of contradiction solving. The
sum of stagnancy in the process of contradiction solving from M0 to M0 − ∆M we call
the time is generated by this variation

∆t ≈ −

T + (T + ∆T )
2

∆M.

dM
dt
Therefrom, we obtain the equation of causality,

lim∆T →0,∆M →0,∆t→0

= −a |M ′| M.

= −a |M ′(x, y, z, ...)| M(x, y, z, ...).

(1)

Truthly, the diﬀerence is the origin of all, but it has the meaning in direct relationship,
in direct comparison. Some state which has any intrinsic contradiction must vary to reach
a new one having no intrinsic contradiction, or exactly, having inﬁnitesimal contradiction.
The greater the value of the contradiction derivative with respect to some degree of
freedom is, the better the ’scent’ for way out in that degree of freedom will be, the greater
the strength of the solved contradiction over that degree of freedom will be.

It is easy to see that equation of causality (1) is represented as a ’classical’ form. It
can be developed to more general form in which the time is considered as a new degree of
freedom. However, Eq. (1) looks like familiar equations, and we will use it for applying
to concrete problems. Though the law of causality (1) is abstract its concrete form in
each problem is very clear. And in the next Section we show the process of the Universe’s
evolution which lays the foundation for building a theory of the Universe.

3 The Process of The Universe’s Evolution

3.1 The general mechanism

To survey clearly the evolution of the Universe, we ﬁrstly review four important concepts:
time, space, matter, and motion.

About the time. Can the time exist independently, if it is separated from space, matter,
and motion? Evidently, no. If the time were separated from motion, the conception of it
would have no meaning. The time cannot self-exist, it is the eﬀect of motion. No motion,
no time.

About the motion. The motion also would not self-exist if it were separated from

matter and space.

4

And about the matter. The matter also cannot self-exist without space.

It exists
owing to not only itself but also the coexistence of the space surrounding it. In essence,
the matter is nothing but just some space with intrinsic relationship diﬀerent from familiar
space we see around us.

Imagine that all are vanished: matter, space,..., and in general, every diﬀerence is
vanished. Then, there exists only one. It is homogeneous and limitless everywhere. It
can self-exist. It is the ﬁrst element. In this unique there is nothing, but there exists the
’Nothing’. The Nothing is the origin of all, the cause of all, since it has the ﬁrst diﬀerence.

In Section 2, we have said the axiom of the theory of causality. That is the diﬀerence.
Imagine that if the present Universe has many diﬀerences, the ﬁrst state of the Universe
will be the state which has fewest diﬀerences. It is logical to show that the ﬁrst Universe’s
state is the Nothing, and the transformation chain ”diﬀerence - contradiction - solving”
is the expansion of the Universe.

A remarkable consensus has been developing recently around what is called ”quantum
cosmology”, which proposes a beautiful synthesis of seemingly hostile viewpoints. In the
beginning it was Nothing. No space, no matter or energy. But according to the quantum
principle, even Nothing was unstable. Nothing began to decay, i.e. it began to ’boil’, with
billions of tiny bubbles forming and expanding rapidly. Each bubble became an expanding
sub-universe6. Sub-universes can literally spring into existence as a quantum ﬂuctuation
of Nothing. Resonances of vacuum ﬂuctuations create ﬁrst elements of matter.

In Ref. [2] we show the elementary equation of Evolution

∂M = eΣ(−)∆t

and the conservation relation of quanta

(3)

where n is total of quanta, i is quantum number generated by each step of expansion of
the Universe, C n

is binary coeﬃcient.

It is easy to realize that Eq. (2) is also a form of equation of causality (1). But Eq. (2)
gives us an important application in modelling the multiplication and the combination of
quanta. There are two objects from Eq. (2) we can use to study: one is actions, the other
is quanta. Studying actions gives us laws, equations, representations in each considered
ﬁeld. And studying quanta gives us models, classiﬁcations, arrangements of quanta. To
describe the evolution of the Universe, it is better for us to investigate quanta.

6Our universe is actually part of a much larger ”multiverse” of sub-universes. Our sub-universe may
co-exist with other sub-universes, but our sub-universe may be one of the few compatible with life. This
would answer the age-old question of why the physics constants of the universe fall in a narrow band
compatible with the formation of life. If the universal constants were changed slightly, then life would
have been impossible.

Call α, β, γ, ... quanta. For each quantum there is a rule of multiplication as follows

αn → e∂ααn =

i αn−i = (α + 1)n
C n

(4)

n

Xi=0

where n is order of combination. Although Eq. (4) is obtained from Eq. (2) in considering
for quanta, it can be found meaningly using the evolution principle shown in Ref. [2]. Eq.
(4) itself represents the evolution of the Universe.

3.2 Examples for the doublet and the triplet

Using Eq. (4) we consider two stages in the process of the Universe’s evolution: doublet
and triplet.

For two interactive quanta the rule of multiplication reads

αn, βn →

(eβ∂ααn + eα∂β βn) =

i αn−iβi = (α + β)n.
C n

Xi=0

And similar to three interactive quanta

αn, βn, γn →

(e(β+γ)∂ααn + e(γ+α)∂β βn + e(α+β)∂γ γn) =

And so fourth. Eqs. 5 and 6 can be drawn as schemata.

It is easily to identify that the above schemata have the forms similar to the SU(2)
and the SU(3) groups. This means that for n quanta we have a corresponding schema
according to the SU(n) group, and the multiplication and the combination of the Universe
conform to the SU group. And from these schemata we can draw periodic diagrams of
the Universe’s quanta.

For simpliﬁcation, we show below the periodic diagram of the two quanta’s multipli-
cation made of the schema (7). Remodel (7) with regard to the level splitting we have a
new diagram,

which is nothing but the Mendeleev periodic table built in the energy levels.

The pictures Fig.1 and Fig.2 have a very special signiﬁcance besides the periodic law.
They give us a model of the evolution in the pine-tree and the spiral from simplex to
complex, from low-level to high-level.

4 Conclusions and Prospects

There is a truth that everybody knows: the nature is diﬃcult to understand for us when
it has not been discovered yet, but it is really beautiful when we understand it. This
is science, where the ultimate worth of one’s ideas is that they lead to a genuine under-
standing of nature. And an idea or a theory not only represents daily phenomena but
also makes predictions that survive comparison with observation and experiment based
on fundamental principles and laws that underlie the universe. By the present article, we
can conﬁrm an existence of an ultimate principle or an ultimate law from which others
could be found out.

We realize that the most important principle of nature is that all observable prop-
erties of things are about relationships. The diﬀerence has meaning in direct relation-

9

ship. Actions are in interaction in mutual relationships. Contradictions are generated in
mutual-rejection relationships. Transformation, change, or motion, variation, or exactly
contradiction solving, does experience of relationships. Even space and time must be
spoken about in terms of relationships. There is no such a thing as space independent of
that which exists in it and no such thing as time apart from change. These mean that
the universe is in uniﬁcation, and this uniﬁcation is created by relationships of causality.

Relationships of causality give us an ultimate law which is called the law of causality.
Following the logical source of the law of causality, we open up limitless horizons of a
view of the universe. The Universe was born from Nothing, and its evolution created
beautiful worlds of numerous form of things whose structure and complexity can be self-
organized. We understand that there are natural processes, easily comprehensible, by
which organization can arise naturally and spontaneously, without any need for a maker
outside of the system. That is conﬁrmed in the present article.

Although the results we obtained in this article is similar to ones that modern physics
discovered, we open to the possibility that the answers to many of the questions we have
about why phenomena, things, the elementary particles, or the fundamental forces are as
they are and not otherwise, and why the nature created beautiful worlds in the way we
see not otherwise. Moreover, we have the expectation to answer the greatest questions:
”Where does the universe come from?” or ”What is the evolution, the self-organization,
the variety, or the fate of the universe?” or ”Where does the matter come from and where
is the missing matter?”.

In the present article’s view of the universe, everything is from to nothing, everything
may be smooth at the beginning but does not stay smooth forever, because today our
universe is very inhomogeneous. So the universe was not perfectly homogeneous either
when it began or shortly after it began but, rather, it was slightly inhomogeneous. It
had small regions where the density of matter was slightly higher than average and other
regions where it was slightly lower than average. They are really tiny. Yet tiny as they
are to begin with, these inhomogeneities are very important because they are the seeds
from which particles, star clusters, galaxies and, eventually, human beings, will grow
in the way that their structure must be formed systematically from within by natural
processes of self-organization such as periodic, multiplicative, combinative, evolutive, and
etc. principles.

Our universe has a variety of mysteries to discover. But we cannot say everything in
a day. Many and very many beautiful worlds are in future of our discovery. This article
is only the ﬁrst one we would like to open up a ﬁrst view of the universe. The ﬁrst is the
key idea behind evolution of the universe from nothing, the second the idea behind the
principle of causality. These themes are only essential for understanding what happened,
is happening, and will happen in the universe.

Of course, this does not mean that theories will be discovered, based on the principle
of causality, are proven to be right; only observation and experiment can, in the end,
tell us that. But a deﬁnite fact that we enter the 21st century with new ideas and wide
horizons, with much to do and everything to talk about.

1 Introduction

It is well known that cosmic strings were appeared at the very early stages
of the Universe evolution. The cosmic string ”sources” are the scalar ﬁelds
that were, in turn, produced due to the vacuum phase transitions [1]. One
of the lagrangians that describes these ﬁelds is the Higgs’s lagrangian for the
complex scalar ﬁeld χ(x),

L = ∂αχ∗∂αχ + m2χ∗χ − λ(χ∗χ)2,

(1)

where λ is coupling constant describing the ﬁeld self-interaction. The la-
grangian is essentially nonlinear. This is the reason that, in general, cosmic
strings are nonlinear as well.

To describe the strings, let us study the thread-like matter that consists
of the set of inﬁnitely thin crossless threads and a fully continuous spacetime.
The energy-momentum tensor of this thread-like matter can be written as

T αβ = µuαuβ − tαβ.

The second term can be interpreted as the stress tensor that appeared due to
the oscillations of each thread. These oscillations occur in view of the string’s
tension, or due to elastic force. We should stress, in a complete analogy with
the classical mechanics [2], that the elastic force must include not only linear
term but also a nonlinear one. By virtue of the nonlinear term, the stress
tensor of the thread-like matter has the following form:

tαβ = µlαlβ(1 −

lγlγ),

where

is the corresponding coupling constant of the order of λ. Inserting

eqs. (2) and (3) into the energy-momentum consrevational law and using the
standard notation, we get the equations of motion of nonlinear cosmic string
[3],

¨xα − x′′α(1 −

x′γx′

γ) = 0.

The nonlinear character of cosmic string leads to the appearance of some
additional terms in the metric coeﬃcients that describe the spacetime interval
in the vicinity of such a string.

Indeed, inserting eqs. (2) and (3) into the Einstein’s gravitational ﬁeld
equations, putting that cosmic string along the z-axis and specifying the
results of [3], we get the 4-dimensional interval in quasi-cartesian coordinates
in the following form:

For the case ε = 0, the expression (5) recovers the standard Vilenkin’s space-
time interval [4].

Deducing of Vilenkin’s metric ansatz for the rectilinear massive cosmic
string has stimulated a number of research papers devoted their cosmological
and astrophysical applications; e.g., motion of a test particle, nonrelativistic
[4] and relativistic [5], and light ray propagation in the solitary cosmic string
background.

Moreover, in all subsequent generalizations of this metric the behaviour
of geodesic lines has been examined as well. Particularly, the dynamics of
test particle in the gravitational ﬁeld of cosmic string with kink has been
studied in [6]; light deﬂection caused by a cosmic string carrying a wave
pulse was investigated in [7]; the motion of light rays and test particles in
the gravitational ﬁeld of a semiclassical cosmic string was considered in [8];
the dynamics of test particles in the gravitational ﬁeld of cosmic string pass-
ing through a black hole, through a domain wall was analyzed in [9]; the
inﬂuence of the current-carrying cosmic string background on the light rays
propagation was treated in [10].

In this paper, in accordance to the general logic of investigation of the new
types of cosmic string metrics, brieﬂy discussed above, we study geodesics
lines in the gravitational ﬁeld of nonlinear cosmic string.

Upon the admited coordinate transformations,

and retaining corrections terms of the order of γµε2, the expression (6) can
be written in the form

Introducing the new angle variable,

and omitting, for simplify, the minus sign at all the coordinates, it is easy to
verify that the interval (8) looks like a quasi-newtonian one. Namely,

We have accounted that the angle Φ varies in accord to

0 ≤ Φ ≤ 2πb,

(11)

ε2

where b = [1 − 4γµ](1 +

) . The above form is the reason why the interval

(10) describes the quasi-newtonian modiﬁed conical spacetime.

The direct procedure of ﬁnding lagrangian from the arbitrary spacetime
interval has been presented in [11]. Using this procedure, for the test particle
that moves in z = const plane in the gravitational ﬁeld with metric (10), we
get

L = (1 − 2γµε2 ln

.

As this lagrangian does not explicitly depend neither on x0, nor on Φ, then
the derivatives of L with respect to dx0/ds and dΦ/ds give two ﬁrst integrals
of motion: the total energy,

(1 − 2γµε2 ln

and the total angular momentum,
r2 dΦ

respectively.

Moreover, as the lagrangian (12) does not explicitly depend on s too, then

another integral of motion exists, namely,

So, from eqs. (13) and (14) we have the 4-velocity components,

Substituting eqs. (16) and (17) into (15) and introducing new variable

3 Null geodesic lines in the nonlinear cosmic

string background

Let us consider the basic types of the null geodesic lines in the nonlinear
cosmic string spacetime characterized by the interval (10).

a) Hyperbolic light rays propagation. For any null geodesic line the con-

stant C is equal to zero. Then from (18) we have, approximately,

(

)

+ u2 =

E2
M 2 (1 − 2γµε2 ln r0u).

Diﬀerentiating the above expression with respect to Φ we get

We look for the solution of this equation in the form

dΦ2 + u = −γµε2 E2

M 2

.

u = u0 + u1 + · · · ,

where u0 describes the free motion while u1 describes a perturbation, up to
the ﬁrst order accuracy.

For the nonperturbed motion we have simple trajectory. Namely, the

equation

has the solution

dΦ2 + u0 = 0

u0 =

u1 = −γµε2 E

Hence, the general solution of the equation of motion (18) is

u =

Now, it is easy to ﬁnd the light deﬂection angle from eq. (26). We note

that in the case of straight-line trajectory the polar angle varies from −

π

to

b. That is why the radius-vector can be rotated up to the full angle

π
2

πb. The angle values Φ = ±

b give us u = 0, i.e. r = ±∞. All the above

relations are valid for the nonperturbed trajectory (22). For the perturbed
trajectory (24), the same angle values lead to a small, but nonzero, value of
u. Therefore, the last term is equal to zero if Φ > ±
π

So, let us denote the angle at which u = 0 as ±

angle. Substituting it into the eq. (26) we obtain, approximately,

b.

Therefore, the angle δ is found as

and the full deﬂection angle of the light rays in the nonlinear cosmic string
background is

b) Radial light rays propagation. In this case from eq. (15) we approxi-

mately have

Integrating this expression from 0 to arbitrary point r gives us

dx0 = (1 + γµε2 ln

)dr.

r
r0

x0 = r[1 − γµε2(1 − ln

r

)].

We can use this relation to calculate the Shapiro’s eﬀect in the gravitational
ﬁeld of nonlinear cosmic string. Indeed, the lapse time corresponding to the
nonlinearity of cosmic string can be easily obtained,

∆x0

ncs = γµε2(r2 − r1) ln

r2 − r1
r0

.

To estimate the magnitude of the eﬀect let us suppose that the nonlinear
cosmic string is placed between Earth and Mercury, in the plane which is
normal to the planets plane of motion. In this case, r2 − r1 ≈ 1, 4a.u. ≈
2, 21011m. Assuming γµ ∼ 10−6 and r0 ∼ 10−30m, that refers to string
line mass density and Compton wavelength corresponding to GUT models,
accordingly, ε ∼ 10−7 [3], we get ∆tncs ∼ 10−15sec. One can see that this
time interval is too small to be detected experimentally; note that Shapiro’s
eﬀect due to gravitational ﬁeld of the Sun is of the order of 10−4sec.

4 Nonisotropic geodesic lines in the gravita-
tional ﬁeld of nonlinear cosmic string

Finally, let us consider the main types of timelike geodesic lines in the non-
linear cosmic string spacetime.

a) Hyperbolic motion. For the case of nonisotropic timelike geodesic lines,
Inserting this value into eq. (18) we obtain, within the

Formally, this equation diﬀers from that of the isotropic geodesic line (19).
However, diﬀerentiating it with respect to Φ leads to the equation that fully
coincides with eq. (20),

In the following, we deal only with the nonperiodic terms in eq. (26). There-
fore, the resulting solution is

u =

∆Θ = πγµε2

It is easy to see that the above timelike trajectory is a little bit diﬀererent
from the straightlike one, eq. (22). This diﬀerence is described by the angle

between the asymptotics of trajectories. This expression is completely equiv-
alent to the angle (29) that had been calculated above. We note that in the
case of linear cosmic srting the deﬂection angles for test particle and light
ray are equal to each other, too [9].

b) Radial motion. For this type of motion Φ = const. Hence, from eq.

(15) we get

v =

If r → r0, i.e. on the surface of nonlinear cosmic string, then both of
the velocities, (37) and (38), are equal to their newtonian expression vn =

)1/2. The last relation means that the velocity is constant, due to

the free motion in ﬂat space.

It should be pointed out that the second term in eq. (37) may be equal
to zero, at some conditions. Namely, for the speciﬁc value of the radial
coordinate,

rlim = r0 exp (

1 − E2
γµε2(2 − E2)

)

(39)

we have v = 0. However, the spatial region rlim ≤ r ≤ r0 can not be reached
by the test particle, in its free motion. Hence, it can move only in the region
r0 ≤ r ≤ ∞.

circular velocity is staying constant in the ﬂat space. Moreover, the circular
velocity is equal to zero if r = rlim; see eq. (39). However, the test particle
cannot move in the ﬁnite region rlim ≤ r ≤ r0, in this case too.

5 Conclusion

We have examined the isotropic and nonisotropic geodesic lines in the grav-
itational ﬁeld of nonlinear cosmic string. Nonlinear terms in the equation of
motion imply some new dynamical eﬀects, in both the light rays propagation
and the test particle motion. We have found additional deﬂection angle for
the null and timelike geodesic lines; see eqs. (29) and (36). As to the timelike
geodesics, we have found equivalence of the radial and circular velocities, in
the newtonian approximation.

We conclude this Section with the following remark, Dynamical processes
in the vicinity of cosmic strings are not limited to the light rays and test
particle propagation. Research of the reciprocal dynamics of cosmic strings
(oscillating cosmic strings [12]) is important in studying the early Universe
cosmology. So, the next step in investigation of the nonlinear cosmic strings
interactions could be dynamics of the test thread, in the nonlinear cosmic
string background.

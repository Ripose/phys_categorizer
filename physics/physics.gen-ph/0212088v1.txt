Abstract

Small chemical sensors are subjected to adsorption-desorption ﬂuctuations which
usually considered as noise contaminating useful signal. Based on temporal proper-
ties of this noise, it is shown that it can be made useful if proper processed. Namely,
the signal, which characterizes the total amount of adsorbed analyte, should be sub-
jected to a kind of amplitude discrimination (or level crossing discrimination) with
certain threshold. When the amount is equal or above the threshold, the result of
discrimination is standard dc signal, otherwise it is zero. Analytes are applied at low
concentration: the mean adsorbed amount is below the threshold. The threshold is
achieved from time to time thanking to the ﬂuctuations. The signal after discrimi-
nation is averaged over a time window and used as the output of the whole device.
Selectivity of this device is compared with that of its primary adsorbing sites, based
on explicit description of the threshold-crossing statistics. It is concluded that the
whole sensor may have much better selectivity than do its individual adsorbing sites.

1 Introduction

Detectors of chemical substances are usually based on selective adsorption-
desorption (binding-releasing) of analyzed chemicals by speciﬁc adsorbing sites
(receptor molecules). The receptor molecules are attached to an electronic
device able to measure the amount of the analyte adsorbed during the binding-
releasing process. The device may be either a MEMS device, such as quartz
crystal microbalance [1,2], or vibrating/bending cantilever [3], or ﬁeld eﬀect

transistor [4], or other [5]. The device with the receptor molecules is called
chemical sensor or detector. In order to be useful, the detector must be able
to discriminate between diﬀerent chemicals, to be selective. Its selectivity is
normally the same as that of its receptor molecules (see Eqs.(6,7)).

The size of industrial sensors has constant tendency to decrease [3]. The power
of useful signal produced by a small detector becomes very small. As a result,
noise of the detector itself constitutes a substantial portion of its output signal.
Depending on its construction, there are several reasons for a small detector
to be noisy [6]. One type of noise is due to the fact that the adsorption-
desorption process is driven by brownian motion, which is stochastic. As a
result, the instantaneous total amount of adsorbed analyte is subjected to
irregular ﬂuctuations visible in the output signal. This noise is called the
adsorption-desorption noise [7]. It is present in any small detector which is
based on binding-releasing of analyte. The adsorption-desorption noise can
dominate over all other types of intrinsic noise [8].

In this paper only the adsorption-desorption noise is taken into account. The
detector is expected to be a threshold detector (ThD), Fig.1.

tion sites; PSU — primary sensing unit; ThU — threshold unit; TAU — temporal
averaging unit.

Namely, the ﬂuctuating signal characterizing the amount of adsorbed analyte
in the primary sensing unit (PSU in Fig.1) is fed into amplitude discriminator
unit (threshold unit, ThU in Fig.1). The threshold unit is characterized by a
certain threshold. It has zero as its output if the adsorbed amount is below
the threshold, and it outputs standard dc signal while the adsorbed amount
is equal or above the threshold. The output of ThU is averaged over a sliding
time-window to have ﬁnal output practically time-independent. This signal is
considered as the output of the ThD.

In this paper, the temporal properties of the binding-releasing stochastic pro-
cess are utilized to characterize the outputs of ThD if two analytes are sep-

2

arately presented at equal concentrations. This allows to compare selectivity
of ThD with that of its receptor molecules. The main conclusion is that the
ThD may be much more selective than do its adsorbing sites.

2 Deﬁnitions and assumptions

The adsorption-desorption process is described by the following association-
dissociation chemical reaction

(1)

(2)

A + R

AR,

k+
⇀↽
k−

p =

k+c
k+c + k−

.

where A, R, AR denote molecules of analyte, adsorption site or receptor, and
analyte-receptor binary complex, respectively. At constant temperature, the
rate constants, k+, k− are time-independent. They can be determined either
from experimental measurements, or estimated theoretically [8]. Let N denotes
the total number of receptor molecules per detector. The analyte is presented
at concentration c. The probability p for any R to be bound with A is 1

The mean number of adsorbed molecules, hni, can be calculated as follows:

hni = pN.

If two diﬀerent analytes A1, A2 are tested at the same concentration, either
the Eq.(2), or experimental measurements will give two values, p1, p2. We say
that the receptor molecule has selectivity with respect to A1, A2, if p1 6= p2

(expect, p1 > p2). The molecular selectivity, µ, is deﬁned as 2 , 3

The primary signal, S0(t) in Fig.1, usually increases if the number n of ad-
sorbed molecules increases:

where the exact dependence of S0 on n is determined by the sensor construc-
tion and the transduction mechanism it employes. For simplicity, it is expected
that in the case of gravimetric sensor, A1 and A2 have equal molecular masses.

Deﬁne selectivity δ for a whole detector in terms of ﬁnal output signal (S in
Fig.1) as follows:

µ = ln

p2

.

n > n′ ⇒ S0 > S′
0,

δ = ln

S1
S2

,

where S1, S2 are the ﬁnal outputs for analytes A1, A2, respectively.

Both S0(t) and n(t) are subjected to adsorption-desorption noise. In a detec-
tor without the threshold unit, the ﬁnal output signal can be made linearly
proportional to the mean number of adsorbed molecules:

Si ∼ piN,

i = 1, 2.

This is achieved either by temporal averaging, or by choosing large detector
with powerful primary signal in which contribution of adsorption-desorption
ﬂuctuations is not visible. Substituting (6) into (5) one obtains for selectivity

2 If one do not expect that p1 > p2 than Eq.(3) should be replaced by µ =
| ln(p1/p2)|.
3 This deﬁnition of selectivity diﬀers from used in chemistry the speciﬁcity of as-
sociation which is expressed in terms of dissociation constant. For analyte A, the
dissociation constant is deﬁned as [A]1/2 = k−/k+. Eq.(2) can be rewritten using the
dissociation constant: p = 1/(1 + [A]1/2/c). From this equation it is clear that an-
alytes with diﬀerent dissociation constants have diﬀerent binding probabilities and
vice versa. This proves suitability of both descriptions, even if numerical values of se-
lectivity expressed in terms of dissociation constants, say as µ′ = ln([A2]1/2/[A1]1/2),
will diﬀer from used here. The µ values can be expressed in terms of dissociation
constants: µ = ln((c + [A2]1/2)/(c + [A1]1/2)). The main diﬀerence between the µ′
and µ is that the latter depends on concentration. This is in accordance with situ-
ation in natural olfactory systems where discriminating ability usually depends on
concentration [10].

(8)

Thus, selectivity of detector in which the ﬂuctuations are averaged out either
immediately after the primary sensing unit, or inside it is equal to that of its
individual adsorbing sites.

The threshold unit, ThU, rises a threshold which the S0 must overcome in
order to make possible further stages of processing. The crossing may happen
from time to time thanking to the adsorption-desorption ﬂuctuations. Due to
(4), the threshold can be characterized by the number N0 of analyte molecules
which must be adsorbed before the nonzero signal appears at the output end
of the ThU. It is assumed that the ThU is ideal in a sense that the N0 is the
exact value which is not subjected to ﬂuctuations. If N0 is achieved, the ThU
has standard constant signal as its output. The signal does not depend on the
exact value of n(t) provided it is above or equal to N0.

Denote by T the temporal window over which the averaging is made in the
TAU (Fig.1), and by Tb, Ta (Tb + Ta = T ) the total amount of time during
which n(t) is below or above the threshold, respectively, when 0 ≤ t ≤ T . The
ﬁnal output, S in Fig.1, should be linearly proportional to Ta/T . This gives
for the selectivity of ThD:

δ = ln

Ta2

,

where Ta1, Ta2 correspond to A1, A2, respectively.

3 Estimation of selectivity

In accordance with (8), it is necessary to estimate the total amount of time the
n(t) spends above the threshold when t ∈ [0; T ]. This can be done by adding
together lengths of all separate intervals during which n(t) ≥ N0 continuously.
Denote by ζ the number of those intervals, and by T k
a , 1 ≤ k ≤ ζ the length
of the k-th continuous interval. Then

If two analytes, A1, A2 are considered, then in (10), (11), k− and p should be
replaced with k−i, pi, i = 1, 2, respectively. Substituting (10), (11) into Eq.

which is proven in [11]. Substitution of (14) into Eq.(13) gives

Taking into account that the total number of adsorbing sites, N, as well as N0
can be very large, it is clear from the estimate (15) that δ can be much larger

than µ, provided the fraction (p0 − p1)/(1 − p1) is not very small. It must be
at least positive, which requires

p0 > p1,

or

p1N < N0.

(16)

Taking into account that p1 increases with concentration (see Eq.(2)), inequal-
ity (16) can be considered as imposing an upper limit for concentration c at
which the eﬀect of selectivity improvement might be expected based on the
estimate (15). It is worth to notice that when condition (16) holds, the mean
amount of adsorbed analyte is below the threshold one, and threshold crossing
may happen only due to ﬂuctuations.

4 Numerical examples

As one can conclude from the estimate (15), the selectivity improvement is
higher for higher N0. On the other hand, one cannot chose the N0 as high
as desired because the ThU in Fig.1 is expected to be ideal. If one chose
N0 = 100 then the ideality means that the threshold level in the ThU is
allowed to have less then 1% jitter. Similarly, if one chose N0 = 104 then
the threshold level must be kept with better than 0.01% precision. Otherwise,
noise in the threshold level should be taken into account in the reasoning of
n.3, and this will lead to a less promising estimate. Another conclusion, based

on the estimate (15), suggests that the smaller is the concentration (smaller p1)
of the analytes, the better is discrimination between them. But in this case the
threshold will be achieved during small fraction of time spent for measuring.
As a result, the output signal will be very small and may be lost in the TAU
unit. It is natural to require that the output signal for more aﬃne analyte
is higher than the 10% of the maximal output signal, which is produced if
n(t) ≥ N0 all the time. Taking into account Eq.(12) this leads to the following
constraint

say T = 1 s, then the mean frequency of crossing the threshold should be
high enough in order to have, e.g., ζ > 1000. This could be achieved if the
mean durations of being continuously above and below the threshold are short
enough. If ¯Tabc = ¯Tbc + ¯Tac, then Eqs.(10),(11) give

or, choosing T = 1 s,

¯Tabc < 0.001 s.

5 Conclusions and discussion

In this paper, selectivity of chemical sensor is compared with that of its pri-
mary receptors (adsorbing sites). The sensor is expected to be a small one,
in which the main source of noise is due to the adsorption-desorption ﬂuc-
tuations. In the sensor considered, the signal from the primary sensing unit

is immediately subjected to the amplitude discrimination deﬁned in the In-
troduction, and obtained piecewise-constant signal (L(t) in Fig.1) is averaged
over a time window. The averaged signal (S in Fig.1) is taken as the output
of whole sensor.

The threshold-crossing statistics derived from the exact description of the
adsorption-desorption stochastic process is used for estimating selectivity. As
a result, it is concluded that selectivity of this sensor can be much better than
that of its primary receptors. The eﬀect may be expected in a limited range
of concentrations of analytes, which depends on the threshold level. For high
concentrations the selectivity falls to that of the primary receptors (Fig.2), and
for low ones the output signal will be too small even for more aﬃne analyte.
The best situation is expected when the mean number of bound receptors
is just below the threshold one, and the threshold is frequently crossed due
to the presence of ﬂuctuations. Thus, in practical realization a possibility of
tuneable threshold should be considered.
Usually, noise in sensory devices is taken as unfavorable factor 5 . In this con-
sideration, the presence of noise looks like factor improving the sensor per-
formance. But with the ideal threshold unit in hands much can be done even
without noise. Expect that the noise is initially averaged out either by spatial
averaging (choosing big primary unit with large N), or by temporal averaging
(interchanging TAU with ThU in Fig.1). The averaged signals for the A1, A2
can be very close (see Eq. 6), but the ideal ThU with tunable threshold will
be able to discriminate perfectly between them. Thus, even if the ﬂuctuations
in this sensor are made working, the answer what is better to do ﬁrst for
the practical purposes: the amplitude discrimination, or temporal averaging,
depends on physical parameters of the environment in which the sensor oper-
ates, and on physical characteristics of the sensor itself, including intensity of
noises other than the adsorption-desorption one. Interesting, in natural olfac-
tory systems, a kind of amplitude discrimination is made immediately after
the primary reception [11,13]. Also in those systems the threshold is tunable
due to adaptation of individual neurons.

purposes.

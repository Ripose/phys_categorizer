Abstract. The paper deals with the concepts of mass and gravity in the formalism of 4-
dimensional optics, previously introduced by the author. It is shown that elementary particles
can be associated with 4-dimensional standing wave patterns with the Compton wavelength
and both inertial and gravitational mass are derived from this concept and shown to be at-
tributable to an waveguide laid along the particle’s worldline; the same formalism is shown to
accommodate also mass due to binding energy within compact bodies. Momentum exchange
with accelerated bodies through gravitons is discussed and shown similar to mode exchange
in optical ﬁbers. Reported anomalies on the behaviour of the Foucault pendulum, both pe-
riodic and exceptional on the occasion of solar eclipses, are explained not only qualitatively
but also on order of magnitude, resorting to graviton exchanges between Earth and the Sun
or the Moon. It is argued that these eﬀects provide experimental evidence of gravitons.

Keywords: Gravity; gravitons; 4-dimensional optics; elementary particles.

Introduction

The paper’s purpose is to show that mass and gravity can be derived from geometrical
properties of space alone. Two points of departure are used in order to reach the same
end, those being mass scaling of coordinates introduced in a previous paper [1] and
Compton wavelength for elementary particles.

In the work mentioned above, corrected and complemented in a later paper [2],
mass scaling of coordinates was introduced to allow massive bodies to follow metric
geodesics of equation

2L = gαβ ˙xα ˙xβ = 1,

(1)

where L is the movement Lagrangian and ”dot” indicates time derivativea. In this
formulation gαβ incorporates a factor m2, equal to the square of the moving body’s
mass, which scales local coordinates. An alternative method would be to scale arc
length as time divided by the moving body’s mass, but this approach breaks the nice
symmetry of the Universal variational principle given by dt2 = gαβdxαdxβ and was
rejected in favor of coordinate scaling.

aGreek letters are used for indices taking values between 0 and 3 and roman letters for indices
with values between 1 and 3. Use is also made of indices that refer to a speciﬁc coordinate, like r, θ
and φ with spherical coordinates.

The same papers linked Compton wavelength of elementary particles to waves of
angular frequency ω = mc2/¯h associated to those particles and propagating along their
worldline. In the previous expression c is the speed of light in vacuum and ¯h is Planck’s
constant divided by 2π. Using non-dimensional units mass becomes exactly equal to
the frequency associated with the particle, so it is expected that mass and frequency
are just two diﬀerent views of the same realityb. Further along the expression Compton
frequency will sometimes be used to refer to the angular frequency associated with an
elementary particle; this will be considered the same as the particle’s mass expressed
in diﬀerent units.

This paper develops the theory further, establishing a close connection between
matter, gravity and periodic oscillations of space. The theory is based on the formation
of 4-dimensional wave patterns as a result of localized resonance modes in elementary
particles, something that other authors have already suggested [3]. Both inertia and
gravity will be derived from this simple concept and will assume that massive bodies act
as superposition of elementary particle vibrational modes, together with modes due to
orbital and vibrational frequencies within the body. This paper is concerned solely with
gravity, but the author believes that other interactions, namely electrodynamics and
chromodynamics, will eventually be included in the theory under a uniﬁed approach.

2 Equivalence between Compton frequency and inertial mass

Previous papers [1, 2] introduced a 4-dimensional space with signature 4 which in
many circumstances of interest can become Euclidean. These circumstances include
movement under the gravitational ﬁelds due to stationary bodies, which are generally
described by the metric gαβ = m2n2δαβ, with m the inertial mass of a moving body and
n the space curvature due to gravity. What this metric tells is that in order to use time
interval to measure geodesic arc length one must use a local scale factor n associated
with an inertia scale factor m. It is possible to use unscaled coordinates if the geodesic
arc length is no longer directly associated with time but rather ds = dt/mn. The local
scale factor does not represent intrinsic curvature, but is rather a convenience that
one can choose to use or not. There are situations, naturally, when space cannot be
ﬂattened by a simple change of coordinates; these include those cases when the ﬁeld
source is not stationary, namely when it is accelerated. The works mentioned above
discuss the electromagnetic ﬁeld due to a moving charge, as one situation where a
change of coordinates would not ﬂatten space.

It is natural to address the simple cases ﬁrst and defer the complications to later
discussions. This paper proceeds in that line, starting with the ﬁeld and associated
metric due to a stationary elementary particle and generalizing the conclusions in
successive steps. The premises are the Universal measurement of geodesic arc length
provided by time intervals, if scaled coordinates are used, and the association of a
Compton frequency with every elementary particle.

bNon-dimensional units are obtained dividing length, time and mass by the factors
G¯h/c5 and

¯hc/G, respectively; G is the gravitational constant. Electric charge is normalized by

G¯h/c3,

the charge of the electron but this normalization will not be needed in the present work.

According to the theory developed in Ref. [1], the 4-dimensional worldline of a
particle with mass m is given by Eq. (1). If the particle is under the inﬂuence of a
stationary gravitational ﬁeld the metric takes the form m2n2δαβ, with n a function
of the spatial coordinates xi, (i = 1, 2, 3). Considerations made in the next section
justify the allowance that is made here for the gravitational ﬁeld n of a stationary
body to be a function of all the 4 coordinates without changing the diagonal form of
the metric. Deﬁning the conjugate momentum kα = ∂L/∂ ˙xα it is

which allows the geodesic equation to re-written in terms of momentum components

kα = gαβ ˙xβ = m2n2δαβ ˙xβ,

δαβkαkβ = m2n2.

This equation remains unchanged if both sides are multiplied by the harmonic wave
function ψ = exp(j kαxα). This wave function represents a pattern of standing plane
waves in 4-dimensional space but it is a truly propagating wave in 3D; in fact spatial
dependence can be separated from the dependence on x0 as ψ = exp[j (k0x0 + kixi)],
to highlight that when x0 is ﬁxed the wave exhibits a sinusoidal variation along the
direction deﬁned by ki. The 4-dimensional momentum kα functions as wave vector for
the stationary wave pattern.

If both sides of Eq. (3) are multiplied by ψ, noting that ∂αψ∂βψ = ψ∂αβψ, one

gets the harmonic wave equation

δαβ∂αβψ =

m2n2ψ,

−

indicating that the wave pattern has a spatial frequency mn along the wavefront
normal.

The equation can have a diﬀerent interpretation if a new wave function is intro-
duced as Ψ = mψ. Then m2 = ΨΨ∗, with ∗ standing for complex conjugate, and he
new equation is

δαβ∂αβΨ
ΨΨ∗n2 =

Ψ.

−

It is possible to say that the spatial frequency is always unity if coordinates are scaled
by mass √ΨΨ∗ and ﬁeld n. While the ﬁrst interpretation is consistent with the
deﬁnition of Compton wavelength, the latter is more in line with the author’s previous
work.

It is now convenient to consider a more general situation where the metric is allowed
to have an arbitrary form. It is always possible to make gαβ = m2nαβ and replace Eq.
(3) by

with nαβ = (nαβ)−1. Introducing the wave function Ψ as before,

This is the general form of wave equation (5).

Eqs. (6) and (9) represent two diﬀerent views of the same phenomenon; the ﬁrst one
describes a particle’s worldline, while the latter describes an equivalent wave pattern
and can be seen as the analogous to Klein-Gordon equation in 4-dimensional optics.
This is not unlike ray and wave descriptions of optics, which are equivalent as long
as the dimensions involved remain large compared to the wavelength. Similarly in
4-dimensional optics one is allowed to deal with particle’s worldlines as long as all the
dimensions involved are large compared to their Compton wavelengths.

It is possible to conclude that an elementary particle with known momentum can
be associated with a 4-dimensional stationary wave with spatial angular frequency
equal to the particle’s mass multiplied by the local gravitational ﬁeld and wave vector
equal to its momentum.

3 Vacuum, gravitons and photons

General relativity accepts that space is curved by gravity and moving bodies are af-
fected by space curvature. The assumption of 4-dimensional optics is that not only the
gravitational ﬁeld but also the inertial mass of a moving body determine curvature,
the latter through coordinate scaling. It has been shown before [1, 2] that electromag-
netic ﬁelds can be assigned to space curvature, which is then determined also by the
electric charge of the moving particle. The present paper is concerned mainly with
gravity and so considerations about electromagnetic ﬁelds will not be extended; it is
important to understand, though, that ultimately all gravitational and electromag-
netic ﬁelds result from the superposition of electrostatic and gravitational ﬁelds due
to elementary particles. The cited works showed that Lorentz force can eﬀectively be
deduced from the electrostatic ﬁeld of a moving charge. Accordingly the eﬀect of a
moving electrically charged elementary particle on empty space can be examined and
it can be accepted that the latter must be ﬁlled with a superposition of similar eﬀects.
In Ref. [2] the author established the ﬁelds due to both gravity and electric charge
of a body of mass M and charge Q as n = exp(M/r) and v = exp(Q/r), respectively.
Further along in this paper discusses how the gravitational ﬁeld is generated, while the
electrostatic ﬁeld will be the subject of future work; for now it is useful to accept the
expressions above just as a result of compatibility with Newtonian and electrostatic
forces. If another body with mass m and electric charge q is under the inﬂuence of

J. B. Almeida, A theory of mass and gravity in 4-dimensional optics

those ﬁelds, its movement follows the geodesic of the space deﬁned by the metric

It is convenient to decompose the metric into four components as gαβ = m2nαβ(vαβ )q/m,
where nαβ designates the gravitational ﬁeld, vαβ the electric ﬁeld, m is the inertial
mass and q the electric charge.

There are some important consequences of the equation above. First of all notice
that the metric due to electrostatic and gravitational ﬁelds is diagonal and can have
an anisotropy on the 0th element if the electrostatic ﬁeld is present. A stationary
body could be the source of an electromagnetic ﬁeld but this is never the case with
an elementary particle. Notice also that the electric charge of the body that suﬀers
the inﬂuence of the electrostatic ﬁeld is equally responsible for the anisotropy, while
its mass inﬂuences the whole metric. In fact the metric ceases to exist if there is no
inertial mass. This is the result of the concept of metric linked to the movement and
not to space itself. A further point that needs to be raised is that the ﬁelds don’t
die away as distance increases, but rather tend exponentially to unity, leading to a
concept of a ﬁeld ﬁlled vacuum, entirely compatible with the uncertainty principle and
postulates by other authors [3, 5].

The fact that inertial mass is essential for the existence of a movement metric
is shown in the wave equation (9) by its collapse when Ψ has zero amplitude. The
question tha must be addressed is the possibility of existence of some type of wave
solutions in vacuum which don’t require mass. One can have a particle approach
similar to what was done for photons in Refs. [1, 2] or a wave approach which is done
below.

Consider a body following its worldline where it is possible evaluate the derivatives
˘xi = dxi/dx0. When this body is stationary it is the source of a ﬁeld which is here
restricted to gravity and designated nαβ = n2δαβ; the evaluation of the ﬁeld when the
body is moving involves the consideration of the tensor

A gravitational ﬁeld nαβ is of the form given by Eq. (14), even if it is the result
of a superposition of many individual gravitational ﬁelds; naturally in the latter case
the ˘xi must be replaced by something that results from the combined movements of
all the ﬁeld sources. Eq. (15) can be expanded as

It can be shown that the equation does not hold any solutions of interest when the
ﬁeld is stationary, i.e. when the ﬁeld is created by a body in uniform motion. For an
accelerated body it is possible to try a solution on 3-space, by setting x0 = 0; if one is
interested on a 3-space solution it is possible also to try a tangent function Φ, which
does not depend on x0 but has the same dependence on the spatial coordinates as φ.
The resulting equation is

For simplicity it is assumed that the body follows a circular orbit with radius r and
proper time angular speed ω around the x3 axis. Accordingly x1 = cos(ωx0), x2 =

and x2 = I[exp(j ωx0)], with R() and I() meaning real part and imaginary part, re-
spectively. With this notation it is ˘x1 = j rω cos(ωx0) and ˘x2 = j rω sin(ωx0). Making

is composed of many elementary particles and orbital movements so, in general, it is
expected that a massive body is the source of waves, or gravitons when quantization is
introduced, with a spectral distribution that results from the masses of the individual
elementary particles. These waves propagate in all directions of space, interfering with
other bodies which are the source of the gravitational ﬁeld that determines the ﬁrst
body’s worldline. In the particular case of two bodies orbiting each other in circular
orbits, they generate waves of equal frequency and opposing phase which cancel each
other or, to put it in terms of gravitons, they interchange gravitons with equal total
momentum.

Inertial mass of orbital systems

It is now appropriate to consider an orbiting elementary particle and search for the
mass ﬁeld solution of the wave equation (9) which yields the inertial mass of this
particle as part of an orbital system instead of searching for massless solutions as was
done in the previous section. Without loss of generality one can use a frame ﬁxed
to the center of the orbital system, so as to set the whole system stationary. In this
frame the elementary particle is described by a wave Ψ = m exp(j kαxα), which obeys
Eq. (9) with the ﬁeld given by Eq. (14). The general solution of the equation is rather
complex but there is special interest on a tangential solution valid on the origin, so
only the 0th component is examined. It is legitimate to do this if the particle is part
of an orbiting system that cancels out all 3-space components. The wave equation on
the origin is then

As conclusion to the present section one can say that the inertial mass of a compact
body is the sum of all its elementary constituents masses minus a contribution of
masses resulting from all the orbital frequencies within the body. On the wave picture,
a complex body acts as a complex wave pattern resulting from the superposition of
many harmonic wave patterns.

5 Gravity as an evanescent ﬁeld

In section 2 the inertial mass of an elementary particle was associated to its Compton
frequency, through a ﬁeld Ψ whose nature was unspeciﬁed and in section 4 it was
shown that a compact body’s mass can be viewed as a superposition of many harmonic
waves due to each of the elementary particles’ masses and to the multitude of orbital
frequencies within the body.
In section 3 it was shown also that an orbiting body
must exchange momentum with the metric in order to follow a circular orbit and
necessarily this conclusion could be extended to any accelerated movement. All the
previous discussions were centered on inertial mass and it has not yet been established
how a particle or a body aﬀects the metric in order to allow this momentum exchange.
The fact that an orbiting body’s mass is reﬂected in the center as a diﬀerent mass,
when applied to an elementary particle is indicative that containment or localization of
a particle determines its eﬀective mass. How an elementary particle’s mass is generated
is not known but it is possible to assume that it is the result of some containment of
yet another wave of diﬀerent frequency and so one speculates that all mass probably
results from some sort of containment of harmonic waves. Eventually one may ﬁnd
that all mass is the result of containment of a single frequency which would then
deserve to be designated by Higgs frequency. Containment can be generated by a
local change of the scale factor n, acting as a 4-dimensional refractive index, but it
can also result from more complex metric changes. In this framework a body or even
an elementary particle is seen as a 4-dimensional waveguide extended along the body
or particle’s worldline.

In a similar way to 3-dimensional optical waveguides, namely optical ﬁbers, the
guided ﬁeld originates an external evanescent wave with the same spatial frequency
along the waveguide direction as exists inside. The following paragraphs set the equa-
tions for this evanescent wave in the case of an elementary particle and it will not be
diﬃcult to extend the conclusions to more general situations. The present analysis
deals solely with the radially symmetric component of the evanescent ﬁeld, although a
guided wave is expected to produce an evanescent ﬁeld due to the circular component
of the wave vector. The latter evanescent ﬁeld is probably connected with spin and
electric charge and is thus outside the scope of the present paper.

The radially symmetric component of the evanescent wave due to a stationary
particle of mass m must exhibit a frequency m along the 0th direction and has an

equation

v2δij ∂ij ψ =

m2ψ,

where the letter v on the equation designates a propagation speed of wavefronts deﬁned
generally as the derivative ds/dt, with ds the arc length of the wavefront normal in
ﬂat Euclidean space. Notice that this equation could also be applied to the mass of
an orbiting particle given by Eq. (25).

Naturally the resulting ﬁeld must have spherical symmetry, which implies that the
wave equation will have a more manageable form in spherical coordinates. Further-
more, because ψ is a function of r and x0 alone, it is possible to express v as

The operator δij∂ij is a Laplacian; considering spherical symmetry one can make
the replacement δij ∂ij = ∂rr + 2∂r/r. Re-writing Eq. (26) in spherical coordinates
and inserting Eq. (27) one gets upon simpliﬁcation

So far no comments were about the nature of the ﬁeld ψ but this question must
be addressed if in order to understand its relation to gravity. It is postulated that
ψ is the local coordinate scale factor, by which it is meant that space is corrugated
with the Compton frequency on the particle’s worldline and that this corrugation is
extended to inﬁnity on the form of an evanescent ﬁeld. There must be a transition
from the ﬁeld on the worldline to the evanescent ﬁeld but so far there are no means
to choose among the many possibilities. In any case a particle will always act as a
4-dimensional waveguide for the ﬁeld ψ, which will allow the extrapolation of many
eﬀects known in their 3-dimensional counterparts.

The ﬁeld ψ deﬁnes the local scale factor or alternatively it deﬁnes how the geodesic
arc length should be measured; accordingly in Eq. (2) one makes the assignment
n = √ψψ∗. In the absence of mass it is expected that the scale factor will be unity and
so constant C1 in the equation above can be made unity; constant C2 must become
zero for zero mass. The ﬁeld does not die away completely but an oscillation with
unit amplitude is extended to inﬁnity; this is seen as one possible source of quantum
vacuum ﬂuctuations required by the uncertainty principle or the zero point ﬁeld as
proposed as early as 1916 [3, 5]. The actual value for constant C2 is easy to establish
resorting to compatibility with Newton mechanics. If this path is taken constant C2
can be made equal to the mass, in a similar way to what was used in Refs. [2, 6].
This argument will be used in the present work and an independent derivation of this
constant’s value will be deferred until there is better understanding of the waveguiding

10

process. Consequently the gravitational ﬁeld due to a stationary elementary particle
will be written as

ψ = e(m/r±j mx

0

).

(30)

It is now easy to understand the mechanism of momentum exchange by accelerated
particles discussed previously, through a parallel with 3-dimensional waveguides. It
is well known that some guided modes in an index-diﬀerence waveguide, such as an
optical ﬁber, can be lost when the waveguide is bent [7]. The reverse is also true,
although less common; a bent waveguide can gain energy from the outside, which
becomes guided energy if further along the waveguide is straightened up. Similarly,
elementary particles are seen as 4-dimensional waveguides where similar processes
can occur. Accelerated particles have curved worldlines which correspond to bent
waveguides and are able to exchange momentum with other particles these being the
ultimate ﬁeld sources.

6 Gravitational shielding and Foucault’s pendulum

This section makes use of the anomalies of Foucault’s pendulum oscillation reported
by Allais [8] as experimental evidence of gravitons. Some references will also be made
to the later observations with a torsion pendulum [9] and to the 1990 experiment in
Finland, which did not conﬁrm the previous results [10].

The point of departure is that gravity is carried by massless gravitons, which are
momentum carriers such as photons. The distinction between photons and gravitons
is a question of function and essence which will be discussed in future work. Gravitons,
like photons, are expected to have essentially straight trajectories that can be slightly
bent by gravitational ﬁelds. The latter eﬀect is too small to be detected in normal
experiments and will not be considered. Gravitons must interact with matter if they
are to interchange momentum with it. So in the majority of cases massive bodies must
be considered opaque to gravitons, although it is conceivable that in some cases they
could be transparent.

It will be shown below that all the anomalies reported by Allais [8] can be explained
by shielding of Solar and Lunar gravity by the Earth or the Moon. Allais reported two
periodic anomalies, with 24h and 25h periods respectively, and a sporadic anomaly
during the Solar eclipse of 1959. It is intended to show that the 24h period anomaly
can be explained by Earth shielding of Solar gravity, a similar thing happening with
the 25h period anomaly but this time due to shielding of Lunar gravity. The Solar
eclipse anomaly can be explained by Lunar shielding of Solar gravity.

The main eﬀect of Terrestrial gravity on the pendulum is precisely the oscillatory
motion. Azimuth change of Foucault’s pendulum is due to minor diﬀerences in the
direction of gravitational pull in neighboring points on Earth. Naturally, the fact
that the Earth is rotating has the consequence that the pendulum oscillation plane
must rotate in order to eliminate the ”drag” caused by the passage of the diﬀerential
gravity. Foucault’s eﬀect is easier to understand if one thinks of a referential which
is not subject to Earth’s rotation; this approach, however, is not the best for the
comparisons made below and so the discussion will be set on a referential on Earth.

Allais dismissed Solar and Lunar eﬀects as possible explanation for the observed

anomalies as follows [8]:

These eﬀects are so small that none of the 19th-century authors who worked on
the theory of the pendulum, some of whom were excellent mathematicians, ever had a
desire to compute them.

The extreme smallness of the eﬀects computed can readily be accounted for if we
allow for the fact that, in order to obtain the true gradient ~f of the Moon and Sun
attraction at a point on the surface of the ground, with respect to Earth, we must
take the diﬀerence between the attractions at this point and at the center of the Earth,
respectively. Gradient ~f is of the order of 10−8.

Furthermore, the plane of oscillation of the pendulum can rotate, under the inﬂu-
ence of the solar and lunar attraction, only because of the variations of the gradient
about the point considered. Therefore, the diﬀerence ∆ ~f between the value of ~f at the
mean position of the pendulum and its magnitude at a nearby point must be considered.
It is of some 10−13.

Furthermore, nothing in the current theory of gravitation can be considered likely

to account for the screen phenomenon observed during 1954.

The objective is to show that if gravity screening is allowed, solar and lunar gravi-
tional ﬁelds have eﬀects which are of the same order of magnitude as terrestrial ones.
In the following S.I. units are used instead of non-dimensional ones, so that the values
obtained in the calculations are easy to compare with everyday results.

Using spherical coordinates in a frame ﬁxed to Earth with origin at its center, the
gravitational ﬁeld can be represented by the vector ~g = gˆr, where g is the acceleration
of gravity g = 9.8 ms−2 and ˆr is the unit vector along the radial direction. If two
points on Earth are separated by an angle dφ, there is a gravity diﬀerence between
those two points whose magnitude is given by dg = gdφ.

The value of Sun’s gravity on Earth is easily evaluated using Newton’s formula
10−3 ms−2. Considering shielding, that value corresponds
Gm/d2 and it averages 5.9
to the gravity on the illuminated portion of the planet, while on the dark side it must
be zero. The transition zone from full to zero solar gravity is remarkably small and
is responsible for an appreciable gradient, in spite of the comparatively small value of
solar gravity. Dividing Sun’s diameter by the average distance from Sun to Earth one
10−3 radians, which corresponds roughly to 55Km on Earth’s
gets an angle of 9.3
surface. Dividing the value of solar gravity by the transition zone angle yields an
angular dependence of 0.63 ms−2 per radian, which is approximately 1/15 of terrestrial
gravity variation and perfectly in line with Allais’ ﬁndings. This can easily account
for the 24h period of the anomalies.

×

Similar calculations performed for the Moon lead to a gravity variation of 0.0037 ms−2

per radian, which is about 250 times smaller than terrestrial variation. Although the
value obtained is about one order of magnitude smaller than would be necessary to
account for the observed eﬀect, the period is 25h as desired.

In
The eclipse anomaly was rightly attributed by Allais to a screening eﬀect.
this case the angular dependence is considerably smaller than in the daily variation,
because the transition zone is much wider than the mere 55 Km of the latter. The felt
eﬀect is of the same order of magnitude or even larger because the linear speed of the
transition zone is very high.

Ann. Phys. (Leipzig) ? (2001) ?

Consider now the torsion pendulum experiments [9, 10], one of which apparently
conﬁrmed Allais’ results and the other could not detect any anomalies. The second
experiment was conducted by Ullakko et al.
in Helsinky during the 1970 total solar
eclipse. Naturally, both the size of the transition zone and its speed are latitude
dependent. At high latitudes the transition zone is wider and its speed is smaller, so
it is normal that the manifestation of solar gravity variation is more diﬃcult to detect.
This is true also for the 24h and 25h period anomalies as well.

The eﬀects of solar and lunar gravity variations on Foucault’s pendulum are easier
to explain than on a torsion pendulum. In fact, the period of a torsion pendulum is
determined by the suspended mass and the spring constant of the suspension. The
eﬀect of a gravitational change in the period can be due both to the variation in
the weight of the suspended mass and on some change of the spring constant due to
extension or contraction. These eﬀects are necessarily much smaller than azimuthal
changes in Foucault’s pendulum, where a change in period is also expected but is
probably too small to be detected. Saxl reports a period increase during the eclipse,
which was not recovered after the eclipse was over. This can only b attributed to creep
on the suspension caused by the gravitational change during the eclipse.

The question arises about what sort of experiments could be conducted on Earth
to prove or disprove gravity shielding theory. Why can’t one just use any sort of
screen to shield form Earth’s gravity, for instance? The reason is that any screen at a
ﬁxed height from the surface will absorb and shed an equal amount of momentum and
so gravity shielding does not have any eﬀect. The screen actually seems transparent
to gravity. Things will be diﬀerent behind a free falling object or any object on a
geodesic orbit around Earth, for in this case the object will absorb all the momentum
that reaches it and will incorporate this momentum in its own. Objects in free fall
or in geodesic orbits are expected to cast a gravitational shadow behind them and
eﬀectively shield any other objects in that shadow from Earth’s gravity.

7 Conclusions and further developments

4D optical theory was used to successfully explain inertial and gravitational mass. In
this process it was shown that the worldline equation for an elementary particle could
be transformed into a wave equation with the Compton spatial frequency. It was also
shown that the gravitational ﬁeld could be derived from an evanescent wave equation
if it was assumed that the particle acted like a 4-dimensional waveguide. Particles
or bodies constrained to a region of space, namely to an orbit, were found to reﬂect
their own mass on the center of gravity, as well as a negative mass resulting from the
binding energy.

The author was able to show that massless particles (gravitons and photons) have
wave equations similar to elementary particles but while the latter are standing wave
patterns, those of massless particles are propagating waves in 3-dimensional space
supported on an oscillatory 0th coordinate of 4-space. Massless particles act as mo-
mentum carriers for accelerated particles and the momentum exchange process was
shown to be similar to mode loss and gain in optical ﬁbers.

Allais’ experimental results with a Foucault pendulum [8] were used as evidence of

graviton existence and the order of magnitude of most of his reported anomalies was
explained through terrestrial and lunar shielding of gravitons origination on the Sun
and the Moon.

The author expects to have shown suﬃcient evidence that elementary particles are
indeed 4-dimensional waveguides, because this hypothesis proves entirely satisfactory
for the explanation of their mass, be it inertial or gravitational mass. It is not clear
what sort of wave is being guided nor what is the guidance mechanism. No comments
were made about electromagnetism or weak and strong interactions, although the
author has some hope that the future will allow the derivation of all the elementary
particles as guided modes of one single frequency wave (the Higgs frequency) and all
the interactions as evanescent ﬁelds relative to these modes. Some preliminary results
have already shown that, at least qualitatively, this might be true.

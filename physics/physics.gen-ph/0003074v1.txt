Summary of

Hierarchic Theory of Condensed Matter
(http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0003044)

A basically new hierarchic quantitative theory, general for solids

and liquids, has been developed.

It is assumed, that unharmonic oscillations of particles in any con-
densed matter lead to emergence of three-dimensional (3D) superpo-
sition of standing de Broglie waves of molecules, electromagnetic and
acoustic waves. Consequently, any condensed matter could be con-
sidered as a gas of 3D standing waves of corresponding nature. Our
approach uniﬁes and develops strongly the Einstein’s and Debye’s
models.

Collective excitations, like 3D standing de Broglie waves of molecules,

representing at certain conditions the mesoscopic molecular Bose con-
densate, were analyzed, as a background of hierarchic model of con-
densed matter.

The most probable de Broglie wave (wave B) length is deter-
mined by the ratio of Plank constant to the most probable impulse
of molecules, or by ratio of its most probable phase velocity to fre-
quency. The waves B are related to molecular translations (tr) and
librations (lb).

As far the quantum dynamics of condensed matter does not follow in general
case the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the real most probable de
Broglie wave length can exceed the classical thermal de Broglie wave length and
the distance between centers of molecules many times.

This makes possible the atomic and molecular Bose condensation in solids
and liquids at temperatures, below boiling point. It is one of the most important
results of new theory, conﬁrmed by computer simulations on examples of water
and ice.

Four strongly interrelated new types of quasiparticles (collective excita-

tions) were introduced in our hierarchic model:

1. Eﬀectons (tr and lb), existing in ”acoustic” (a) and ”optic” (b) states

represent the coherent clusters in general case;

2. Convertons, corresponding to interconversions between tr and lb types of

the eﬀectons (ﬂickering clusters);

3. Transitons are the intermediate [a ⇋ b] transition states of the tr and lb

eﬀectons;

4. Deformons are the 3D superposition of IR electromagnetic or acoustic

waves, activated by transitons and convertons.

Primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are formed by 3D superposition of the
most probable standing de Broglie waves of the oscillating ions, atoms or
molecules. The volume of eﬀectons (tr and lb) may contain from less than one,
to tens and even thousands of molecules. The ﬁrst condition means validity
of classical approximation in description of the subsystems of the eﬀectons.

2

The second one points to quantum properties of coherent clusters due to
molecular Bose condensation.

The liquids are semiclassical systems because their primary (tr) eﬀectons
contain less than one molecule and primary (lb) eﬀectons - more than one
molecule. The solids are quantum systems totally because both kind of their
primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are molecular Bose condensates. These conse-
quences of our theory are conﬁrmed by computer calculations.

The 1st order [gas → liquid] transition is accompanied by strong decreas-
ing of rotational (librational) degrees of freedom due to emergence of primary
(lb) eﬀectons and [liquid → solid] transition - by decreasing of translational de-
grees of freedom due to mesoscopic Bose-condensation in form of primary (tr)
eﬀectons.

In the general case the eﬀecton can be approximated by par-
allelepiped with edges corresponding to de Broglie waves length in
three selected directions (1, 2, 3), related to the symmetry of the
molecular dynamics. In the case of isotropic molecular motion the
eﬀectons’ shape may be approximated by cube. The edge-length of
primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) can be considered as the ”parameter of
order”.

The in-phase oscillations of molecules in the eﬀectons correspond to the
eﬀecton’s (a) - acoustic state and the counterphase oscillations correspond to
their (b) - optic state. States (a) and (b) of the eﬀectons diﬀer in potential
energy only, however, their kinetic energies, impulses and spatial dimensions -
are the same. The b-state of the eﬀectons has a common feature with Fr¨olich’s
polar mode.

The (a → b) or (b → a) transition states of the primary eﬀectons
(tr and lb), deﬁned as primary transitons, are accompanied by a
change in molecule polarizability and dipole moment without density
ﬂuctuations. At this case they lead to absorption or radiation of IR
photons, respectively. Superposition (interception) of three internal
standing IR photons of diﬀerent directions (1,2,3) - forms primary
electromagnetic deformons (tr and lb).

On the other hand, the [lb⇋ tr] convertons and secondary transitons are
accompanied by the density ﬂuctuations, leading to absorption or radiation of
phonons.

Superposition, resulting from interception of standing phonons in three di-

rections (1,2,3) is termed: secondary acoustic deformons (tr and lb).

Correlated collective excitations of primary and secondary eﬀectons and
deformons (tr and lb), localized in the volume of primary tr and lb electromag-
netic deformons, lead to origination of macroeﬀectons, macrotransitons
and macrodeformons (tr and lb respectively).

Correlated simultaneous excitations of tr and lb macroeﬀectons in the vol-
ume of superimposed tr and lb electromagnetic deformons lead to origination
of supereﬀectons.

In turn, the coherent excitation of both:

tr and lb macrodeformons and

3

macroconvertons in the same volume means creation of superdeformons. Su-
perdeformons are the biggest (cavitational) ﬂuctuations, leading to microbub-
bles in liquids and to local defects in solids.

Total number of quasiparticles of condensed matter equal to 4!=24,
reﬂects all of possible combinations of the four basic ones [1-4], intro-
duced above. This set of collective excitations in the form of ”gas” of
3D standing waves of three types: de Broglie, acoustic and electro-
magnetic - is shown to be able to explain virtually all the properties
of all condensed matter.

The important positive feature of our hierarchic model of matter is that it
does not need the semi-empiric intermolecular potentials for calculations, which
are unavoidable in existing theories of many body systems. The potential energy
of intermolecular interaction is involved indirectly in dimensions and stability
of quasiparticles, introduced in our model.

The main formulae of theory are the same for liquids and solids
and include following experimental parameters, which take into ac-
count their diﬀerent properties:

[1]- Positions of (tr) and (lb) bands in oscillatory spectra;
[2]- Sound velocity;
[3]- Density;
[4]- Refraction index (extrapolated to the inﬁnitive wave length of

photon).

The knowledge of these four basic parameters at the same temperature and
pressure makes it possible using our computer program, to evaluate more than
300 important characteristics of any condensed matter. Among them are such
as: total internal energy, kinetic and potential energies, heat capacity and ther-
mal conductivity, surface tension, vapor pressure, viscosity, coeﬃcient of self-
diﬀusion, osmotic pressure, solvent activity, etc. Most of calculated parameters
are hidden, i.e. inaccessible to direct experimental measurement.

The new interpretation and evaluation of Brillouin light scattering and
M¨ossbauer eﬀect parameters may also be done on the basis of hierarchic the-
ory. Mesoscopic scenarios of turbulence, superconductivity and superﬂuity are
elaborated.

Some original aspects of water in organization and large-scale dynamics of
biosystems - such as proteins, DNA, microtubules, membranes and regulative
role of water in cytoplasm, cancer development, quantum neurodynamics, etc.
have been analyzed in the framework of Hierarchic theory.

Computerized veriﬁcation of our Hierarchic theory of matter on
examples of water and ice is performed, using special computer pro-
gram: Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP, copy-
right, 1997, Kaivarainen). The new optoacoustic device, based on this
program, with possibilities much wider, than that of IR, Raman and
Brillouin spectrometers, has been proposed (see URL: http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk
[CAMP]).

4

This is the ﬁrst theory able to predict all known experimental
temperature anomalies for water and ice. The conformity between
theory and experiment is very good even without any adjustable pa-
rameters.

The hierarchic concept creates a bridge between micro- and macro-
liquids and solids in

phenomena, dynamics and thermodynamics,
terms of quantum physics.

********************************************************************

1. The state equation for real gas

The Clapeyrone-Mendeleyev equation sets the relationship between pressure
(P ), volume (V ) and temperature (T ) values for the ideal gas containing N0
molecules (one mole):

P V = N0kT = RT

(1)

In the real gases interactions between the molecules and their sizes should be
taken into account. It can be achieved by entering the corresponding amend-
ments into the left part, to the right or to the both parts of eq. (1).

It was Van der Waals who choused the ﬁrst way more than a hundred years

ago and derived the equation:

a

(cid:16)P +

V 2(cid:17)(cid:0) V − b (cid:1) = RT

(2)

where the attraction forces are accounted for by the amending term (a/V 2),
while the repulsion forces and the eﬀects of the excluded volume accounted for
the term (b).

Equation (2) correctly describes changes in P,V and T related to liquid-gas
transitions on the qualitative level. However, the quantitative analysis by means
of (2) is approximate and needs the ﬁtting parameters. The parameters (a) and
(b) are not constant for the given substance and depend on temperature. Hence,
the Van der Waals equation is only some approximation describing the state of
a real gas.

We propose a way to modify the right part of eq.(1), substituting it for the
part of the kinetic energy (T) of 1 mole of the substance (eq.4.31 in [1, 2]) in
real gas phase formed only by secondary eﬀectons and deformons with nonzero
impulse, aﬀecting the pressure:

The contribution to pressure caused by primary quasiparticles as
Bose-condensate with the zero resulting impulse is equal to zero also.
It is assumed when using such approach that for real gases the
model of a system of weakly interacted oscillator pairs is valid. The
validity of such an approach for water is conﬁrmed by available ex-
perimental data indicating the presence of dimers, trimers and larger
H2O clusters in the water vapor (Eisenberg and Kauzmann, 1975).

Water vapor has an intensive band in oscillatory spectra at ˜ν =
200cm−1. Possibly, it is this band that characterizes the frequencies of
quantum beats between ”acoustic” (a) and ”optic” (b) translational
oscillations in pairs of molecules and small clusters. The frequencies
of librational collective modes in vapor are absent.

The energies of primary gas quasiparticles (hνa and hνb) can be
calculated on the basis of the formulae used for a liquid (Chapter 4
of [1] or [2]).

However, to calculate the energies of secondary quasiparticles in
(¯a) and (¯b) states the Bose-Einstein distribution must be used for
the case when the temperature is higher than the Bose-condensation
temperature (T > T0) and the chemical potential is not equal to zero
(µ < 0). According to this distribution:

(cid:26) ¯Ea = h¯νa =

(4)

The kinetic energies of eﬀectons (¯a)tr,lb and (¯b)tr,lb states are equal,
only the potential energies diﬀer as in the case of condensed matter.
All other parameters in basic equation (3) can be calculated as

previously described [1, 2].

2. New state equation for condensed matter

Using our eq.(4.3 from [1,2]) for the total internal energy of condensed matter

(Utot), we can present state equation in a more general form than (3).

For this end we introduce the notions of internal pressure (Pin), including all
type of interactions between particles of matter and excluded molar volume
(Vexc):

6

Vexc =

4
3

πα∗N0 = V0(cid:18) n2 − 1
n2 (cid:19)

(5)

where α∗ is the acting polarizability of molecules in condensed matter (see Part
1 of [3]); N0 is Avogadro number, and V0 is molar volume.

The general state equation can be expressed in the following form:

PtotVf r = (Pext + Pin)(V0 − Vexc) = Uef

(6)

where: Uef = Utot(1 + V /T t

kin) = U 2

tot/Tkin

is the eﬀective internal energy and:

(1 + V /Tkin) = Utot/Tkin = S−1

is the reciprocal value of the total structural factor (eq.2.46a of [1]); Ptot =
Pext + Pin is total pressure, Pext and Pin are external and internal pressures;
Vf r = V0 − Vexc = V0/n2 (see eq.5) is a free molar volume; Utot = V + Tkin is
the total internal energy, V and Tkin are total potential and kinetic energies of
one mole of matter.

For the limit case of ideal gas, when Pin = 0; Vexc = 0; and the potential
energy V = 0, we get from (6) the Clapeyrone - Mendeleyev equation (see 1):

PextV0 = Tkin = RT

One can use equation of state (6) for estimation of sum of all types of internal

matter interactions, which determines the internal pressure Pin:

Pin =

Uef
Vf r

− Pext =

n2U 2
tot
V0Tkin

− Pext

(7)

where: the molar free volume: Vf r = V0 − Vexc = V0/n2;
and the eﬀective total energy: Uef = U 2
tot/Tkin = Utot/S.
For solids and most of liquids with a good approximation: Pin ≫ [Pext ∼ 1

atm. = 105P a]. Then from (7) we have:

Pin ∼=

n2Utot
V0S

=

n2
V0

· Utot(cid:18)1 +

V

Tkin(cid:19)

(8)

where S = Tkin/Utot is a total structural factor; Tkin and V are total kinetic
and potential energies, respectively.

For example for 1 mole of water under standard conditions we obtain:
Vexc = 8.4cm3; Vf r = 9.6cm3; V0 = Vexc + Vf r = 18cm3;
Pin ∼= 380000 atm. = 3.8 · 1010P a (1 atm. =105P a).

7

The parameters such as sound velocity, molar volume, and the positions of
translational and librational bands in oscillatory spectra that determine Uef (4.3)
depend on external pressure and temperature.

The results of computer calculations of Pin (eq.7) for ice and water are

presented on Fig. 1 a,b.

Polarizability and, consequently, free volume (Vf r) and Pin in (6) depend on

energy of external electromagnetic ﬁelds (see Part 1 of [3].

Fig. 1. (a) Theoretical temperature dependence of internal pres-
sure (Pin) in ice including the point of [ice ⇔ water] phase transition;
(b) Theoretical temperature dependence of internal pressure (Pin) in
water. Computer calculations were performed using eq. (7).

The minima of Pin(T ) for ice at −1400 and −500C in accordance with eq.(9)
correspond to the most stable structure of this matter, related to temperature
transition. In water some kind of transition appears at 350C, near physiological
temperature.

There may exist conditions when the derivatives of internal pressure Pin are

equal to zero:

(a) :(cid:18) ∂Pin

∂Pext(cid:19)T

= 0 and (b) :(cid:18) ∂Pin

∂T (cid:19)Pext

= 0

(9)

This condition corresponds to the minima of potential energy, i.e. to the
most stable structure of given matter. In a general case there may be a
few metastable states when conditions (9) are fulﬁlled.

Equation of state (7) may be useful for the study of mechanical properties

of condensed matter and their change under diﬀerent inﬂuences.

Diﬀerentiation of (6) by external pressure gives us at T = const:

It is taken into account in (13) and (19) that

because, as has been shown earlier (Fig.25a of [1] and Part 1 of [3]),

It seems that our equation of state (7) may be used to study diﬀerent types
of external inﬂuences (pressure, temperature, electromagnetic radiation, defor-
mation, etc.) on the thermodynamic and mechanic properties of solids and
liquids.

10

3. Vapor pressure

When a liquid is incubated long enough in a closed vessel at constant tem-

perature, then an equilibrium between the liquid and vapor is attained.

At this moment, the number of molecules evaporated and condensed back

to liquid is equal. The same is true of the process of sublimation.

There is still no satisfactory quantitative theory for vapor pressure calcula-

tion.

We can suggest such a theory using our notion of superdeformons, represent-
ing the biggest thermal ﬂuctuations (see Table 1 and Introduction). The basic
idea is that the external equilibrium vapor pressure is related to internal one
(P S
in) with coeﬃcient determined by the probability of cavitational ﬂuctuations
(superdeformons) in the surface layer of liquids or solids.

In other words due to excitation of superdeformons with probability (P S

D),
the internal pressure (P S
in) in surface layers, determined by the total contribu-
tions of all intramolecular interactions turns to external one - vapor pressure
(PV ). It is something like a compressed spring energy realization due to trigger
switching oﬀ.

For taking into account the diﬀerence between the surface and bulk internal

pressure (Pin) we introduce the semiempirical surface pressure factor (qS) as:

P S
in = qSPin − Pext = qS ·

n2Utot
V0S

− Pext

(24)

where: Pin corresponds to eq.(7); S = Tkin/Utot is a total structure factor.

The value of surface factor (qS) for liquid and solid states is not the same:

qS
liq < qS

sol

(25)

Fig. 2. a) Theoretical (−) and experimental (··) temperature de-
pendences of vapor pressure (Pvap) for ice (a) and water (b) includ-
ing phase transition region. Computer calculations were performed
using eq. (26).

11

Multiplying (24) to probability of superdeformons excitation we obtain for
vapor pressure, resulting from evaporation or sublimation, the following formu-
lae:

Pvap = P S

in · P S

D =(cid:18)qS n2U 2

ES
D

kT (cid:19)

(26)

(27)

is a probability of superdeformons excitation (see eqs. 3.37, 3.32 and 3.33).

We can assume, that the diﬀerence in the surface and bulk internal pressure
is determined mainly by diﬀerence in total internal energy (Utot) but not in
kinetic one (Tk). Then a pressure surface factor could be presented as:

qS = γ2 = (Uin/Utot)2

where: γ = U S
surface and bulk total energy.

tot/Utot is the surface energy factor, reﬂecting the ratio of

Theoretical calculated temperature dependences of vapor pressure, described
liq = 3.1 (γl =

by (26) coincide very well with experimental ones for water at qS
1.76) and for ice at qS

sol = 18 (γs = 4.24) (Fig. 2).

The almost ﬁve-times diﬀerence between qS

sol and qS

liq means that the surface

properties of ice diﬀer from bulk ones much more than for liquid water.

The surface factors qS

liq and qS
sol should be considered as a ﬁt pa-
rameters. The qS = γ2
is the only one ﬁt parameter that was used
in our hierarchic mesoscopic theory. Its calculation from the known
vapor pressure or surface tension can give an important information
itself.

4. Surface tension

The resulting surface tension is introduced in our mesoscopic model as a

sum:

σ = (σtr + σlb)

(28)

where: σtr and σlb are translational and librational contributions to surface
tension. Each of these components can be expressed using our mesoscopic state
equation (6, 7), taking into account the diﬀerence between surface and bulk
total energies (qS), introduced in previous section:

to eq.(6); (Pef )tr,lb is a total probability of primary eﬀecton excitations in the

(Pef + Pt)lb + (Pef + Pt)lb + (Pcon + PcMt)

(33)

Under the boiling condition when qS → 1 as a result of (U S

tot → Utot), then
σtr, σlb and σ tends to zero. The maximum depth of the surface layer, which
determines the σlb is equal to the length of edge of cube (llb), that approximates
the shape of primary librational eﬀectons. It decreases from about 20 ˚A at
00C till about 2.5 ˚A at 1000C (see Fig. 7b of [1] or Fig. 4b of [2]). Mono-
tonic decrease of (llb) with temperature could be accompanied by nonmonotonic
change of probabilities of [lb/tr] convertons and macroconvertons excitations
(see comments to Fig. 7a of [1] or to Fig 4a of [2]). Consequently, the temper-
ature dependence of surface tension on temperature can display anomalies at
deﬁnite temperatures. This consequence of our theory is conﬁrmed experimen-
tally (Adamson, 1982; Drost-Hansen and Lin Singleton, 1992).

The thickness of layer (ltr), responsible for contribution of translational
eﬀectons in surface tension (σtr) has the dimension of one molecule in all tem-
perature interval for liquid water.

The results of computer calculations of σ (eq.31) for water and experimental

data are presented at Fig.3.

Fig. 3. Experimental (

) and theoretical (- - -) temperature
dependences of the surface tension for water, calculated from eq.(31).

It is obvious, that the correspondence between theory and exper-
iment is very good, conﬁrming in such a way the correctness of our
model and Hierarchic concept in general.

5. Mesoscopic theory of thermal conductivity

14

Thermal conductivity may be related to phonons, photons, free

electrons, holes and [electron-hole] pairs movement.

We will discuss here only the main type of thermal conductivity

in condensed matter, related to phonons.

The analogy with the known formula for thermal conductivity (κ)

in the framework of the kinetic theory for gas is used [4]:

κ =

1
3

CvvsΛ

(34)

where Cv is the heat capacity of condensed matter, vs is sound velocity, charac-
terizing the speed of phonon propagation in matter, and Λ is the average length
of free run of phonons.

The value of Λ depends on the scattering and dissipation of phonons at
other phonons and diﬀerent types of defects. Usually decreasing temperature
increases Λ.

Diﬀerent factors inﬂuencing a thermal equilibrium in the system of phonons
are discussed. Among them are the so called U- and N- processes describing
the types of phonon-phonon interaction. However, the traditional theories are
unable to calculate Λ directly.

Mesoscopic theory introduce two contributions to thermal conductivity: re-
lated to phonons, irradiated by secondary eﬀectons and forming secondary
translational and librational deformons (κsd)tr,lb and to phonons, irradiated by
a and b convertons [tr/lb], forming the convertons-induced deformons (κcd)ac.bc:

κ = (κsd)tr,lb + (κcd)ac.bc =

1
3

Cvvs[(Λsd)tr,lb + (Λcd)ac,bc]

(35)

where: free runs of secondary phonons (tr and lb) are represented as:

1/(Λsd)tr,lb = 1/(Λtr) + 1/(Λlb) = (νd)tr/vs + (ν d)lb/vs

consequently:

1/(Λsd)tr,lb =

vs

(νd)tr + (ν d)lb

and free runs of convertons-induced phonons:

1/(Λcd)ac,bc = 1/(Λac) + 1/(Λbc) = (νac)/vs + (νbc)/vs

consequently: (Λsd)tr,lb =

vs

(νd)tr + (νd)lb

(36)

(37)

The heat capacity: CV = ∂Utot/∂T can be calculated also from our theory (see
Chapter 4 and 5).

15

Fig. 4. Temperature dependences of total thermal conductiv-
ity for water and contributions, related to acoustic deformons and
[lb/tr]convertons. The dependences were calculated, using eq. (37).

Quantitative calculations show that formula (35), based on our mesoscopic
model, works well for water (Fig. 4). It could be used for any other con-
densed matter also if positions of translational and librational bands,
sound velocity and molar volume for this matter at the same temper-
ature interval are known.

The small diﬀerence between experimental and theoretical data
can reﬂect the contributions of non-phonon process in thermal con-
ductivity, related to macrodeformons, superdeformons and macro-
convertons, i.e. big ﬂuctuations.

6. Mesoscopic theory of viscosity for liquids and solids

The viscosity is determined by the energy dissipation as a result of medium
(liquid or solid) structure deformation. Viscosity corresponding to the shift
deformation is named shear viscosity. So- called bulk viscosity is related to
deformation of volume parameters and corresponding dissipation. These types
of viscosity have not the same values and nature.

The statistical theory of irreversible process leads to the following expression

for shear viscosity (Prokhorov, 1988):

η = nkT τp + (µ∞ − nkT )τq

(38)

where n is the concentration of particles, µ∞ is the modulus of instant shift
characterizing the instant elastic reaction of medium, τp and τq are the relaxation
times of impulses and coordinates, respectively.

16

However, eq.(38) is inconvenient for practical purposes due to diﬃculties in

determination of τp, τq and µ∞.

Sometimes in a narrow temperature interval the empiric Ondrade equation

is working:

η = A(T ) · exp(β/T )

(39)

A(T) is a function poorly dependent on temperature.

A good results in study the microviscosity problem were obtained by combin-
ing the model of molecular rotational relaxation [5] and the Kramers equation
(˚Akesson et al., 1991). However, the using of the ﬁt parameters was necessarily
in this case also.

We present here our mesoscopic theory of viscosity. To this end
the dissipation processes, related to (A ⇋ B)tr.lb cycles of translational and li-
brational macroeﬀectons and (a,b)-convertons excitations were used. The same
approach was employed for elaboration of mesoscopic theory of diﬀusion in con-
densed matter (see next section).

In contrast to liquid state, the viscosity of solids is determined by the biggest
ﬂuctuations: supereﬀectons and superdeformons, resulting from simultane-
ous excitations of translational and librational macroeﬀectons and macrodefor-
mons in the same volume.

The dissipation phenomena and ability of particles or molecules to diﬀusion
are related to the local ﬂuctuations of the free volume (∆vf )tr,lb. According to
mesoscopic theory, the ﬂuctuations of free volume and that of density occur in
the almost macroscopic volumes of translational and librational macrodeformons
and in mesoscopic volumes of macroconvertons, equal to volume of primary
librational eﬀecton at the given conditions. Translational and librational types
of macroeﬀectons determine two types of viscosity, i.e. translational (ηtr) and
librational (ηlb) ones. They can be attributed to the bulk viscosity. The con-
tribution to viscosity, determined by (a and b)- convertons is much more local
and may be responsible for microviscosity and mesoviscosity.

Let us start from calculation of the additional free volumes (∆vf ) originat-
ing from ﬂuctuations of density, accompanied the translational and librational
macrodeformons (macrotransitons).

For 1 mole of condensed matter the following ratio between free volume and

concentration ﬂuctuations is true:

(cid:18) ∆vf
vf (cid:19)tr,lb

=(cid:18) ∆N0

N0 (cid:19)tr,lb

where N0 is the average number of molecules in 1 mole of matter

and

(∆N0)tr,lb = N0(cid:18) P M

Z (cid:19)tr,lb

D

17

(40)

(41)

is the number of molecules changing their concentration as a result of transla-
tional and librational macrodeformons excitation.

The probability of translational and librational macroeﬀectons excitation

(see eqs. 3.23; 3.24):

D

(cid:18) P M
Z (cid:19)tr,lb

=

1
Z

exp(cid:18)−

ǫM
D

kT(cid:19)tr,lb

(42)

where Z is the total partition function of the system (Chapter 4 of [1, 2]).

Putting (41) to (40) and dividing to Avogadro number (N0), we obtain the

ﬂuctuating free volume, reduced to 1 molecule of matter:

∆v0

f =

∆vf
N0

=(cid:20) vf

D

N0 (cid:18) P M

Z (cid:19)(cid:21)tr,lb

(43)

It has been shown above (eq.19) that the average value of free volume in 1 mole
of matter is:

Consequently, for reduced ﬂuctuating (additional) volume we have:

vf = V0/n2

(∆v0

f )tr,lb =

V0

N0n2

1
Z

exp(cid:18)−

ǫM
D

kT(cid:19)tr,lb

(44)

Taking into account the dimensions of viscosity and its physical sense, it
should be proportional to the work (activation energy) of ﬂuctuation-dissipation,
necessary for creating the unit of additional free volume: (EM
f ), and the
period of (A ⇋ B)tr.lb cycles of translational and librational macroeﬀectons
τA⇋B, determined by the life-times of all intermediate states (eq.46).

D /∆v0

In turn, the energy of dissipation should be strongly dependent
on the structural factor (S): the ratio of kinetic energy of matter to
its total internal energy. We assume here that this dependence for
viscosity calculation is cubical: (Tk/Utot)3 = S3.

Consequently, the contributions of translational and librational macrodefor-

mons to resulting viscosity we present in the following way:

ηM

tr,lb =" EM

D
∆v0
f

· τ M(cid:18) Tk

Utot(cid:19)3#tr,lb

(45)

where: reduced ﬂuctuating volume (∆v0

D = −kT · (ln P M

macrodeformons: [EM

18

The cycle-periods of the tr and lib macroeﬀectons has been introduced as:

(cid:2)τ M = τA + τB + τD(cid:3)tr,lb

(46)

where: characteristic life-times of macroeﬀectons in A, B-states and that of
transition state in the volume of primary electromagnetic deformons can be
presented, correspondingly, as follows:

hτA = (τa · τa)1/2itr,lb

and

hτA = (τa · τa)1/2itr,lb

(47)

hτD = |(1/τA) − (1/τB)|−1itr,lb

Using (47, 46 and 44) it is possible to calculate the contributions of (A ⇋ B)
cycles of translational and librational macroeﬀectons to viscosity separately,
using (45).

The averaged contribution of macroexcitations (tr and lb)in viscosity is:

tr · (η)M

ηM =(cid:2) (η)M

lb (cid:3)1/2

(48)

The contribution of a and b convertons to viscosity of liquids could be pre-
sented in a similar to (44-48) manner after substituting the parameters of tr
and lb macroeﬀectons with parameters of a and b convertons:

ηac,bc =" Ec

∆v0
f

τc(cid:18) Tk

Utot(cid:19)3#ac,bc

(49)

where: reduced ﬂuctuating volume of (a and b) convertons (∆v0

f )ac,bc cor-

responds to:

(∆v0

f )ac,bc =

V0

N0n2

1
Z

Pac,bc

(50)

where: Pac and Pbc are the relative probabilities of tr /lib interconversions
between a and b states of translational and librational primary eﬀectons (see
Introduction and Chapter 4); Eac and Ebc are the excitation energies of (a and
b) convertons correspondingly (see Chapter 4 of [1] and [2]);

Characteristic life-times for ac-convertons and bc-convertons [tr/lb] in the
volume of primary librational eﬀectons (”ﬂickering clusters”) could be presented
as:

19

τac = (τa)tr + (τa)lb = (1/νa)tr + (1/νa)lb
τbc = (τb)tr + (τb)lb = (1/νb)tr + (1/νb)lb

The averaged contribution of the both types of convertons in viscosity is:

ηc = (ηac · ηbc)1/2

(51)

(52)

This contribution could be responsible for microviscosity or better term: meso-
viscosity, related to volumes, equal to that of primary librational eﬀectons.

The resulting viscosity (Fig.5) is a sum of the averaged contributions of

macrodeformons and convertons:

η = ηM + ηc

(53)

Fig. 5. Theoretical and experimental temperature dependences
of viscosities for water. Computer calculations were performed using
eqs. (44 - 53) and (4.3; 4.36).

The best correlation between theoretical and experimental data was achieved
after assuming that only (π/2 = 2π/4) part of the period of above described

20

ﬂuctuation cycles is important for dissipation and viscosity. Introducing this
factor to equations for viscosity calculations gives up very good correspondence
between theory and experiment in all temperature interval (0-1000C) for water
(Fig.5).

ﬂuctuations [ τ

As will be shown below the same factor, introducing the eﬀective time of
π/2 ], leads to best results for self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient calculation.
In the classical hydrodynamic theory the sound absorption coeﬃcient (α)
obtained by Stokes includes share (η) and bulk (ηb) averaged macroviscosities:

α =

Ω

2ρv3

s (cid:18) 4

3

η + ηb(cid:19) ,

(54)

where Ω is the angular frequency of sound waves; ρ is the density of liquid.

Bulk viscosity (ηb) is usually calculated from the experimental η and α. It

is known that for water:

(ηb/η) ∼ 3.

The viscosity of solids

In accordance with our model, the biggest ﬂuctuations: supereﬀectons and
superdeformons (see Introduction) are responsible for viscosity and diﬀusion
phenomena in solid state. Superdeformons are accompanied by the emergency
of cavitational ﬂuctuations in liquids and the defects in solids. The presentation
of viscosity formula in solids (ηs) is similar to that for liquids:

ηS =

where: Ps = (P M

equal to product of probabilities of tr and lb macrodeformons excitation (see
42); Es = −kT · ln Ps is the energy of superdeformons (see Chapter 4);

D )tr · (P M

Characteristic cycle-period of (A∗

⇋ B ∗) transition of supereﬀectons is re-
lated to its life-times in A∗, B∗and transition D∗ states (see eq.46) as was shown
in section 4.3:

21

τS = τA∗ + τB∗ + τD∗

(56a)

The viscosity of ice, calculated from eq.(55) is bigger than that of water (eq.53)
to about 105 times. This result is in accordance with available experimental
data.

7. Brownian diﬀusion

The important formula obtained by Einstein in his theory of Brownian mo-

tion is for translational motion of particle:

r2 = 6Dt =

kT
πηa

t

and that for rotational Brownian motion:

ϕ2 =

kT
4πηa3 t

(57)

(58)

where: a - radius of spherical particle, much larger than dimension of molecules
of liquid. The coeﬃcient of diﬀusion D for Brownian motion is equal to:

D =

kT
6πηa

(59)

If we take the angle ¯ϕ2 = 1/3 in (59), then the corresponding rotational corre-
lation time comes to the form of the known Stokes- Einstein equation:

τ =

4
3

k (cid:16) η
πa3 1
T(cid:17)

(60)

All these formulas (57 - 60) include macroscopic share viscosity (η) correspond-
ing to our (53).

8. Self-diﬀusion in liquids and solids

Molecular theory of self-diﬀusion, as well as general concept of transfer phe-
nomena in condensed matter is extremely important, but still unresolved prob-
lem.

Simple semiempirical approach developed by Frenkel leads to following ex-

pression for diﬀusion coeﬃcient in liquid and solid:

22

D =

a2
τ0

exp(−W/kT )

(61)

where [a] is the distance of ﬂuctuation jump; τ0 ∼ (10−12 ÷ 10−13) s is the
average period of molecule oscillations between jumps; W - activation energy of
jump.

The parameters: a, τ0 and W should be considered as a ﬁt parameters.
In accordance with mesoscopic theory, the process of self-diﬀusion in
liquids, like that of viscosity, described above, is determined by two contribu-
tions:

a) the collective, nonlocal contribution, related to translational and

librational macrodeformons (Dtr,lb);

b) the local contribution, related to coherent clusters ﬂickering: [dissocia-
tion/association] of primary librational eﬀectons (a and b)- convertons (Dac,bc).
Each component of the resulting coeﬃcient of self-diﬀusion (D) in liquid
could be presented as the ratio of ﬂuctuation volume cross-section surface:
f ]2/3 to the period of macroﬂuctuation (τ ). The ﬁrst contribution to co-
[∆v0
eﬃcient D, produced by translational and librational macrodeformons is:

Dtr,lb =(cid:20)(cid:0)∆v0
f(cid:1)2/3

·

1

τ M(cid:21)tr,lb

(62)

where: the surface cross-sections of reduced ﬂuctuating free volumes (see

eq.43) ﬂuctuations in composition of macrodeformons (tr and lb) are:

(∆v0

f )2/3

tr,lb =" V0

N0n2

exp(cid:18)−

ǫM

(63)

(τ M )tr,lb are the characteristic (A ⇔ B) cycle-periods of translational and li-

brational macroeﬀectons (see eqs. 46 and 47).

The averaged component of self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which takes into ac-
count both types of nonlocal ﬂuctuations, related to translational and librational
macroeﬀectons and macrodeformons, can be ﬁnd as:

DM = [(D)M

tr · (D)M

lb ]1/2

(64)

The formulae for the second, local contribution to self-diﬀusion in
liquids, related to (a and b) convertons (Dac,bc) are symmetrical by form to
that, presented above for nonlocal processes:

Dac,bc =(cid:20)(∆v0

f )2/3 ·

1

τS(cid:21)ac,bc

(65)

23

where: reduced ﬂuctuating free volume of (a and b) convertons (∆v0

f )ac,bc

is the same as was used above in mesoscopic theory of viscosity (eq.50):

(∆v0

f )ac,bc =

V0

N0n2

1
Z

Pac,bc

(66)

where: Pac and Pbc are the relative probabilities of tr /lib interconversions
between a and b states of translational and librational primary eﬀectons (see
Introduction and Chapter 4)

The averaged local component of self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which takes into

account both types of convertons (ac and bc) is:

DC = [(D)ac · (D)bc]1/2

(67)

In similar way we should take into account the contribution of macroconver-

tons (DMc):

DMc =(cid:18) V0

N0n2

1
Z

PMc(cid:19)2/3

·

1
τMc

where: PMc = Pac · Pbc is a probability of macroconverton excitation;
the life-time of macroconverton is:

τMc = (τac · τbc)1/2

(67a)

(67b)

The cycle-period of (ac) and (bc) convertons are determined by the sum of
life-times of intermediate states of primary translational and librational eﬀec-
tons:

τac = (τa)tr + (τa)lb;

and

τbc = (τb)tr + (τb)lb

(67c)

The life-times of primary and secondary eﬀectons (lb and tr) in a- and b-

states are the reciprocal values of corresponding state frequencies:

[τa = 1/νa; τa = 1/νa; and τb = 1/νb; τ b = 1/νb]tr,lb

(67d)

[νa and νb]tr,lb correspond to eqs. 4.8 and 4.9; [νa and νb]tr,lb could be calculated
using eqs.2.54 and 2.55.

The resulting coeﬃcient of self-diﬀusion in liquids (D) is a sum of nonlocal

(DM ) and local (Dc, DMc) eﬀects contributions (see eqs.64 and 67):

D = DM + Dc + DMc

(68)

The eﬀective ﬂuctuation-times were taken the same as in previous section for
viscosity calculation, using the correction factor [(π/2) · τ ].

24

Fig. 6. Theoretical and experimental temperature dependences
of self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients in water. Theoretical coeﬃcient was cal-
culated using eq. 68.

Like in the cases of thermal conductivity, viscosity and vapor pressure, the
results of theoretical calculations of self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient coincide well with
experimental data for water (Fig. 6) in temperature interval (0 − 1000C).

The self-diﬀusion in solids

In solid state only the biggest ﬂuctuations: superdeformons, representing
simultaneous excitation of translational and librational macrodeformons in the
same volumes of matter are responsible for diﬀusion and the viscosity phenom-
ena. They are related to origination and migration of the defects in solids. The
formal presentation of superdeformons contribution to self-diﬀusion in solids
(Ds) is similar to that of macrodeformons for liquids:

DS = (∆v0

Characteristic cycle-period of supereﬀectons is related to that of tr and lb

macroeﬀectons like it was presented in eq.(56a):

τs = τA∗ + τB∗ + τD∗

(71)

The self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient for ice, calculated from eq.69 is less than that
of water (eq.53) to about 105 times. This result is in accordance with available
experimental data.

Strong decreasing of D in a course of phase transition:

[water → ice] pre-
dicted by our mesoscopic theory also is in accordance with experiment (Fig.
7).

Fig. 7. Theoretical temperature dependences of self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients in ice.

All these results allow to consider our mesoscopic theory of trans-
fer phenomena as a quantitatively conﬁrmed one. They point that
the ”mesoscopic bridge” between Micro- and Macro Worlds is wide
and reliable indeed. It gives a new possibilities for understanding and
detailed description of very diﬀerent phenomena in solids and liquids.

One of the important consequences of our theory of viscosity and
diﬀusion is the possibility of explaining numerous nonmonotonic tem-
perature changes, registered by a number of physicochemical methods
in various aqueous systems during the study of temperature depen-
dences ([6], [7], [8], [9]; [10]; [11], [12]).

Most of them are related to diﬀusion or viscosity processes and may be
explained by nonmonotonic changes of the refraction index, included in our
equations: 44, 45, 50 for viscosity and eqs. 69, 70 for self-diﬀusion. For water

26

these temperature anomalies of refraction index were revealed experimentally,
using few wave lengths in the temperature interval 3 − 950 [13]. They are
close to Drost-Hansen temperatures. The explanation of these eﬀects, related
to periodic variation of primary librational eﬀectons stability with monotonic
temperature change was presented as comments to Fig. 7a of [1] or Fig.4a of
[2].

Another consequence of our theory is the elucidation of a big dif-
ference between librational ηlb (48), translational ηtr (45) viscosities
and mesoviscosity, determined by [lb/tr] convertons (49 and 52).

The eﬀect of mesoviscosity can be checked as long as the volume
of a Brownian particle does not exceed much the volume of primary
librational eﬀectons (eq. 15). If we take a Brownian particle, much
bigger than the librational primary eﬀecton, then its motion will re-
ﬂect only averaged share viscosity (eq.53).

The third consequence of the mesoscopic theory of viscosity is
the prediction of nonmonotonic temperature behavior of the sound
absorption coeﬃcient α (51). Its temperature dependence must have
anomalies in the same regions, where the refraction index has.

The experimentally revealed temperature anomalies of (n) also fol-
low from our theory as a result of nonmonotonic (a ⇔ b)lb equilibrium
behavior, stability of primary lb eﬀectons and probability of [lb/tr]
convertons excitation (see Discussion to Fig.7a of [1] or to Fig.4a of
[2]).

Our model predicts also that in the course of transition from the
laminar type of ﬂow to the turbulent one the share viscosity (η) will
increases due to increasing of structural factor (Tk/Utot) in eq. 45.

The superﬂuidity (η → 0) in the liquid helium could be a result of
inability of this liquid at the very low temperature for translational
and librational macroeﬀectons excitations, i.e. τ M → 0.

In turn, it is a consequence of tending to zero the life-times of
secondary eﬀectons and deformons in eqs.(45), responsible for dissi-
pation processes, due to their Bose-condensation and transformation
to primary ones (see Chapter 12 of [1]). The polyeﬀectons, stabi-
lized by Josephson’s junctions between primary eﬀectons form the
superﬂuid component of liquid helium.

9. Mesoscopic approach to proton conductivity in
water, ice and other systems, containing hydrogen

bonds

The numerous models of proton transitions in water and ice are
usually related to migration of two types of defects in the ideal Bernal-
Fouler structure [14]:

27

1. Ionic defects originated as a result of 2H2O dissociation to hy-

droxonium and hydroxyl ions:

2H2O ⇔ H3O+ + OH−

2. Orientational Bjerrum defects are subdivided to D (dopplet)

and L (leer) ones.

D-defect (positive) corresponds to situation, when 2 protons are
placed between two oxygen atoms, instead of the normal structure of
hydrogen bond: O . . . H − O containing 1 proton.

L-defect (negative) corresponds to opposite anomaly, when even
1 proton between two oxygens is absent. Reorientation of dipole
moment of H2O in the case of D- and L-defects leads to origination
of charges:

qB = q+

D =| q−

L |= 0.38e

(72)

The interrelation between the charge of electron (e), Bjerrum charge
(qB) and ionic charge (eI ) (Onsager, Dupius, 1962) is:

e = eI + qB

(73)

The general approach to problem of proton transition takes into
account both types of defects: ionic and orientational. It was assumed
that orientational defects originate and annihilate in the process of
continuous migration of ions H+ and OH− through the water medium.
Krjachko (1987) considers DL-pairs as a cooperative water cluster
with linear dimensions of about 15˚A and with ”kink”. The Bjerrum’s
DL-pair is a limit case of such model.

The protons conductivity in water must decrease with temperature increas-

ing due to decreasing and disordering of water clusters and chains.

The kink-soliton model of orientational defects migration along the H2O
chain was developed by Sergienko (1986). Mobility of ionic defects exceeds the
orientational ones about 10 times.

But it is important to point out that the strong experimental evidence con-
ﬁrming the existence of just Bjerrum type orientational defects are still absent.
Our mesoscopic model of proton diﬀusion in ice, water and other

hydrogen bonds containing systems includes following stages:

1. Ionization of water molecules in composition of superdeformons

and ionic defects origination;

2. Bordering by H +

3 O and HO− the opposite surface-sides of pri-

mary librational eﬀectons;

3. Tunneling of proton through the volume of primary eﬀecton as

a coherent water cluster (Bose-particle);

28

4. Diﬀusion of ions H +

3 O and HO− in the less ordered medium
between primary eﬀectons can be realized in accordance with ﬂuctu-
ation mechanism described above in Section 8. The velocity of this
stage is less than tunneling.

Transitions of protons and hydroxyl groups can occur also due to

exchange processes (Antonchenko, 1991) like:

H +

3 O + H2O ⇔ H2O + H +

3 O

H2O + HO− ⇔ HO− + H2O

(74)

(75)

The rate of ions transferring due to exchange is about 10 times more,
than diﬀusion velocity, but slower than that, determined by tunneling
jumps.

5. The orientational defects can originate as a result of H2O molecules

rearrangements and conversions between translational and librational
eﬀectons in composition of superdeformons. Activation energy of
superdeformons and macroconvertons in water is 10.2 kcal/M and
about 12 kcal/M in ice (see 6.12; 6.13). The additional activation
energy about 2-3 kcal/M is necessary for subsequent reorientation of
surrounding molecules (Bjerrum, 1951).

Like the ionic defects, positive (D) and negative (L) defects can
form a separated pairs on the opposite sides of primary eﬀectons,
approximated by parallelepiped. Such pairs means the eﬀectons po-
larization.

Probability of H + or HO− tunneling through the coherent cluster - primary
eﬀecton in the (a)-state is higher than that in the (b)-state as far (see 1.30-1.32
of [1]):

[Ea = T a

kin + Va] < [Eb = T b

kin + Vb]

(76)

where: T a
Vb − Va. is the diﬀerence between total and potential energies of these states.

kin are the kinetic energies of (a) and (b) states; Eb − Ea =

kin = T b

In accordance with known theory of tunneling, the probability of
passing the particle with mass (m) through the barrier with wideness
(a) and height (ǫ) has a following dependence on these parameters:

| ψa |∼ exp(cid:16)−

a

b(cid:17) = exp(cid:18)−

a(2mǫ)1/2



(cid:19)

(77)

where:

29

b = /(2mǫ)1/2

(78)

is the eﬀective wave function fading length.

Parameter (b) is similar to wave B most probable amplitude (AB)

with total energy EB = ǫ (see eq. 2.22 of [1]):

b = AB = /(2mEB)1/2

(79)

With temperature decreasing the (a ⇔ b)tr,lb equilibrium of primary
eﬀectons shifts to the left:

Ka ⇔ b = (Pa/Pb) → ∞

(80)

where Pa → 1 and Pb → 0 are the thermoaccessibilities of (a) and (b)
states of primary eﬀectons (see eqs. 4.10-4.12). The linear dimensions
of primary eﬀectons of ice also tend to inﬁnity at T→ 0.

In water the tunneling stage of proton conductivity can be related
to primary librational eﬀectons only and their role increase with tem-
perature decreasing. Dimensions of translational eﬀectons in water
does not exceed that of one molecule as it leads from our computer
calculations.

Increasing of protons conductivity in ice with respect to water,
in accordance with our model, is a consequence of participation of
translational primary eﬀectons in tunneling of [H +] besides librational
ones, as well as signiﬁcant elevation of primary librational eﬀectons
dimensions. Increasing of the total contribution of tunneling process
in protons migration in ice rise up their resulting transferring velocity
comparing to water.

The external electric ﬁeld induce:
a) redistribution of positive and negative charges on the surface
of primary eﬀectons determined by ionic defects and corresponding
orientational defects;

b) orientation of polarized primary eﬀectons in ﬁeld, making quasi-
continuous polyeﬀectons chains and that of the eﬀectons orchestrated
superclusters.

These eﬀects create the conditions for relay mechanism of [H +]
and H +
3 O transmitting in the direction of electric ﬁeld and [HO−] in
the opposite one. In accordance with our hierarchic model, the [H +]
transition mechanism includes the alternation of tunneling, exchange
and usual diﬀusion processes.

10. Regulation of pH and shining of water by

electromagnetic and acoustic ﬁelds

30

In accordance with our model, water dissociation reaction:

H2O ⇔ H + + HO−

S → B ∗

S] transitions in supereﬀectons. This means that stimulation of [A∗

leading to increase of protons concentration is dependent on probability of
[A∗
transitions (superdeformons) by ultrasound with resonant frequencies, corre-
sponding to frequency of these transitions, should lead to decreasing of pH, i.e.
to increasing the concentration of protons [H +].

S]
S → B ∗

The [AS → BS] transitions of supereﬀectons can be accompanied by
origination of cavitational ﬂuctuations (cavitational microbubbles).
The opposite [BS → AS] transitions are related to the collapse of these
microbubbles. As a result of this adiabatic process, water vapor in
the bubbles is heated up to 4000 − 6000 0K. The usual energy of su-
perdeformons in water (Section 6.3):

ǫS
D = 10.2 kcal/M ≃ RT ∗

(81)

correspond to local temperature T ∗ ≃ 5000 0K. For the other hand it
is known, that even 2000 0K is enough already for partial dissociation
of water molecules inside bubbles (about 0.01% of total amount of
bubble water).

The variable pressure (P), generated by ultrasound in liquid is dependent

on its intensity (I, wt/cm2) like:

P = (ρvsI)1/2 · 4.6 · 10−3(atm)

(82)

where ρ is density of liquid; vs - sound velocity (m/s).

[A∗

S → B ∗

S] transitions and cavitational bubbles origination can be stimu-
lated also by IR radiation with frequency, corresponding to the activation energy
of corresponding big ﬂuctuations, described in mesoscopic theory by superde-
formons and macroconvertons.

In such a way, using IR radiation and ultrasound it is possible to regulate
a lot of diﬀerent processes in aqueous systems, depending on pH and water
activity.

The increasing of ultrasound intensity leads to increased cavita-
tional bubble concentration. The dependence of the resonance cavity
radius (Rres) on ultrasound frequency (f ) can be approximately ex-
pressed as:

Rres = 3000/f

(83)

At certain conditions the water placed in the ultrasound ﬁeld, begins
to shine in the region: 300 − 600nm [15]. This shining (sonolumi-
nescense) is a consequence of electronic excitation of water ions and
molecules in the volume of cavitational bubbles.

31

When the conditions of ultrasound standing wave exist, the num-

ber of bubbles and intensity of sonoluminescense is maximal.

The intensity of shining is nonmonotonicly dependent on temperature with
maxima around 15, 30, 45 and 650 [6]. This temperature corresponds to ex-
tremes of stability of primary librational eﬀectons, related to the number of
H2O per eﬀecton’s edge (κ) (see comments to Fig. 7a of [1] or to Fig 4a of
[2]). An increase of inorganic ion concentration, destabilizing (a)-state of these
eﬀectons, elevate the probability of superdeformons and consequently, shining
intensity.

The most probable reason of photon radiation is recombination of water

molecules, turning it into exited state:

−OH + H +

⇋ H2O∗ → H2O + hνp

(84)

Very diﬀerent chemical reactions can be stimulated in the volume of cavitational
ﬂuctuation by the external ﬁelds. The optimal resonant parameters of these
ﬁelds could be calculated using hierarchic theory.

We propose here that the reaction of water molecules recombina-
tion (84) could be responsible for coherent ”biophotons” radiation by
cell’s and microbes cultures and living organisms in visible and ultra-
violet (UV) range. The advances in biophoton research are described
by Popp et al., 1992 [16].

In accordance to our model, the cell’s body ﬁlaments - micro-
tubules (MTs) ”catastrophe” (cooperative reversible disassembly of
MTs) is a result of the internal water cavitational ﬂuctuations due
to superdeformons excitation. Such collective process should be ac-
companied by dissociation and recombination (84) of part of water
molecules, localized in the hollow core of microtubules, leading to
high-frequency electromagnetic radiation (see: http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0003045).
The coherent biophotons in the infrared (IR) range are a conse-
quence of
(a ⇋ b)tr,lb transitions of the water primary eﬀectons in
microtubules.

We can see that lot of well working new theoretical models for
diﬀerent physical phenomena, based on our Hierarchic theory of
condensed matter, can be elaborated.
It means that this theory
may serve as new convenient scientiﬁc language.

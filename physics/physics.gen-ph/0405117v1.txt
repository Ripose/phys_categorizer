result follows from the fact that in the classical limit ¯h = 0 the Schr¨odinger
equation turns to the dynamic equations for the statistical ensemble of clas-
sical particles. The idea that the wave function describes the state of an in-
dividual particle is incompatible with this result. Paradox of the Schr¨odinger

Sq is a statistical
ensemble of particles. Such a statement of the problem is quite evident. But why
is it not stated before in such a form? Apparently, because the most researches

Besides, the statistical average object may have properties which are alternative
for individual objects, and this property is a statistical property, but not a special
quantum property. For instance, the statistical average habitant of a country is

the wave function phase are well known (see for instance [4], Sec.6, 17), One has
shown that quantum description turns to classical one at ¯h
0. However, the
question what object (an individual classical particle, or a statistical ensemble of
classical particles) is described by these equations was not considered.

of the wave function reduction. The correct interpretation is connected with the cor-
rect interpretation of the concept of the measurement. The mathematical technique
of quantum mechanics deals only with the statistical average particles
, and all
predictions of quantum mechanics have a probabilistic (statistical) character. The
quantum technique can predict distribution F (R) of the quantity the quantity
R
at the state ψ, or the probability w (R) of the quantity
at the state ψ. Validity
of the prediction can be tested by the measurement. But this experiment is the
massive experiment (M-measurement), i.e. a set of many single measurements (S-
measurements), because neither distribution F (R), no the probability w (R) can be
measured by means of a single measurement of the quantity

mechanics predicts that the measurement gives the value R′ of the quantity

probability equal to 1. It means that the δ-like distribution is predicted, but not
the measured value R′ of the measured quantity

to test whether the probability w (R′) = 1 (but not whether the measured value of

Inﬂuence of the M-measurement on the wave function ψ of the measured system

value R′ of the measured quantity

selective M-measurement (or SM-measurement).
In general, we can obtain the

reduction, because its reason is quite clear. But if we consider the selective quantum
measurement as a single measurement, where a selection is impossible, the reduction
of the wave function looks as a very mystic procedure which accompanies the quan-
tum measurement. Thus , the statement that wave function describes the statistical

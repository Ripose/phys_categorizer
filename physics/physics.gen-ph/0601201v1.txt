Geometry of the Divergences Problem in QFT

Bar-Ilan University1, Ramat-Gan, Israel

P. Leifer

Abstract

The divergences problem in QFT should be overcame presumably due to the
uniﬁcation of the fundamental interactions [1]. We evidently cannot to achieve this
goal now. Together with this there are divergences in problems where the high-
energy processes simply cannot be involved (say electron self-energy, Lamb’s shift,
etc.). Last ones reﬂect the formal character of perturbation theory applied to inter-
acting secondly quantized amplitudes of the pointwise particles. These diﬃculties
are borrowed partly from the classical theory. I would like to establish some gen-
eral framework for the future uniﬁed theory avoiding to use the method of classical
analogy.

1 Introduction

The classical material points moving in space-time are main original objects of the con-
structive quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT). This approach
bring a lot of conceptual and technical problems. All progress of the theoretical physics
demonstrates that the pointwise in space-time interaction is approximate: the mechanical
interaction of solid bodies is the photon exchanges, nuclear interaction provided by pions,
and the pointwise Fermi interaction realized by the W ±, Z 0 exchange in electro-weak the-
ory. We may assume that all attempts to localize matter in space-time, i.e.
increasing
of resolution by higher energy of collision leads in fact to the delocalization by defreezing
new internal degrees of freedom. On the other hand, mathematically, this locality leads
to the singular functions (the most serious artifact of the local QFT).

The modern nonlocal objects like strings and membranes arose due to attempts to
avoid these diﬃculties. Since physical status these objects is not clear up to now and their
logic leads far away from ordinary physical paradigm [2], it is worth while do ﬁnd a diﬀerent
solution of the divergences problematic. I show here another method of introduction of
nonlocal objects arising in dynamical space-time which is built as speciﬁc section in the
tangent ﬁbre bundle over the “vacuum landscape”.

One may see that the divergences alive in the third order. Since the indeﬁnite trace
T r(¯aa) =
is a coeﬃcient before the transversal to the vacuum two-fermionic term, the
compensation projective term does not help. Nevertheless, we can extract the useful hint:
the vacuum vector (the standard vector in Dirac’s example) should be smoothly changed,
and, furthermore, the transversal component should be reduced during the “smooth”
evolution. One may image some a smooth surface with a normal vector, taking the place
of the vacuum vector. Then the orthogonal projection acting continuously is in fact the
covariant diﬀerentiation of the tangent Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld [3]. One has in fact the
modiﬁcation of the creation-annihilation operators of quantum particles. Let me recall
that the main technical result of Dirac approach [1] is the calculations of the coeﬃcients
Yin and Zin modifying the initial creation-annihilation operators.

Of course, the trivial example of Dirac has only pedagogical sense and one should take
some more realistic model. Dirac undertook attempts to ﬁnd out the better approximation
to the vacuum state vector of the QED [4]. The main idea was to safe physical meaning
of the Schr¨odinger picture in the QED. The approximate state vector found by Dirac
comprises of ‘longitudinal’ and ‘transversal’ components corresponding creations electron-
positron pears and the two electron-positron pears. Thereby ‘deformed’ vacuum vector
has not only trivial modulus variation, but the variation of a direction too. Both of
these approximate vectors

conclusion, that the Schr¨odinger vector in QED does not exist at all, because it does not lie
in any separable Hilbert space [1]. In spite of this extreme point of view, I will assume that

is keeping in mind. This modiﬁcation requires, of course, a deep reconstruction of the QFT
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Physically main content of this program is to design all physical entities in
the terms of the pure quantum state space geometry. Many inequivalent representations

procedure.

First. In the second quantization method one has formally given particles whose prop-
erties are deﬁned by some commutation relations between creation-annihilation operators.
Note, that the commutation relations are only the simplest consequence of the curvature
of the dynamical group manifold in the vicinity of the group’s unit (in algebra). Dynam-
ical processes require, however, ﬁnite group transformations and, hence, the global group
structure. The main technical idea is to use vector ﬁelds over group manifold instead of
indeﬁnite Dirac’s q-numbers. This scheme therefore looking for the dynamical nature of
the creation and annihilation processes of quantum particles.

Second. The quantum particles (energy bundles) should gravitate. Hence, strictly
speaking, their behavior cannot be described as a linear superposition. Therefore the
ordinary second quantization method (creation-annihilation of free particles) is merely
a good approximate scheme due to the weakness of gravity. Thereby the creation and
annihilation of particles are time consuming dynamical non-linear processes. So, linear
operators of creation and annihilation (in Dirac sense) do exist as approximate quantities.
Third. For sure there is an energy quantization but the dynamical nature of this
process is unknown. Avoiding the vacuum stability problem, its self-energy, etc., we
primary quantize, however, the action, not energy. The relative (local) vacuum of some
problem is not the state with minimal energy, it is a state with an extremal of some action
functional.

Planck’s oscillator whose states correspond to the quantum motions with given Planck’s
action quanta. Thereby only action subject to primary quantization but the quantization
of dynamical variables such as energy, spin, etc., postponed to dynamical stage. Phys-
ical oscillators are distributed due to spice-time dependence of frequencies obeying ﬁeld
equations which should established due to a new variation problem.

Presumably there are some non-linear ﬁeld equations whose soliton-like solution pro-
vides the quantization of the dynamical variables but their ﬁeld carriers are smeared in
dynamical space-time. Therefore, quantum “particles”, and, hence, their numbers should
arise as some countable solutions of non-linear wave equations.

I will assume that all “vacua” solutions belong to single separable projective Hilbert
space CP (N

tional, not solution with the minimal energy. Energy will be associated with tangent
vector ﬁeld to CP (N
1) giving velocity of the action variation in respect with a “second
time” [12] close to the notion of Newton-Stueckelberg-Horwitz-Piron (NSHP) time [13].
Dynamical space-time will be built at any vacuum (see below). Therefore Minkowskyan
space-time is functionally local in CP (N

ﬁeld equations connected with two inﬁnitesimally close “vacua”. The connection between
these local space-times may be physically established by the measurement given in terms

I think there is only one Universe but there exists continuum

CP (N

assumption from this point of view.

model. In our case we should ﬁnd equations for these functions starting from conditions
applied to the LDV represented by vector ﬁelds in functional space. In other words one

Perfectly isolated quantum systems such as “elementary” particles do not exist. But
it is natural to assume that the elementary excitations of the ground (vacuum) should
exist as some entity, invariant relative the choice of diﬀerent physical ﬁeld constituting
a setup. On the other hand one should avoid the artiﬁcial distinction between the bare
“elementary” particle and its “surrounding” ﬁeld.

In the framework of SU (N ) symmetry I use a model of the quantum ﬁeld theory based
on a local Hamiltonian of interaction. It consists of the sum of N 2
1 the energies of the
‘elementary systems’ (particle plus ﬁelds) is equal to the excitation energy of the GCS, and
the local Hamiltonian ~H is linear against the partial derivatives

This Hamiltonian describes the interaction between quantum system, given be the lo-
cal analog of the spin-operators (Pauli, Gell-Mann, etc.)
expressed in coordinates
(π1, ..., πi, ...), and its adjoint unitary “ﬁeld shell” Ωα actually transforming states of the
quantum system. We have in fact a self-consistent problem but under some reasonable
assumptions this may be reduced to pure non-linear ﬁeld equations for the “ﬁeld shell”.
The dynamical variables corresponding symmetries of the GCS and their breakdown
should be expressed now in terms of the local coordinates πk. Hence the internal dynamical
local in the state space [5, 6,
variables and their norms should be state-dependent, i.e.
7, 8]. These local dynamical variables realize a non-linear representation of the unitary

5 Dynamical quantum space-time

The internal hidden dynamics of the quantum conﬁguration given by AA should be some-
how reﬂected in physical space-time. Therefore we should solve the “inverse representation
problem”: to ﬁnd locally unitary representation of dynamical group SU (N ) in the dy-
namical space-time where acts the induced realization of the coherence group SU (2) of
the Qubit spinor [5, 6]. Its components subjected to the “quantum Lorentz transforma-
tions” [15]. We should build the local spinor basis invariantly related to the ground states
manifold CP (N
1). First of all we have to have the local reference frame (LRF) as some
analog of the “representation” of SU (N ). Each LRF and, hence, SU (N ) “representation”
may be marked by the local coordinates (3.2) of the “vacuum landscape”. Now we should
almost literally repeat diﬀerential geometry of a smooth manifold embedded in ﬂat ambi-
ent Hilbert space. The geometry of this smooth manifold is the projective Hilbert space
equipped with the Fubini-Study metric that may be expressed in the local coordinates as

If we would like to have some embedding of the “Hilbert (quantum) dynamics” in
space-time we should to formalize the quantum observation (or measurement of some
dynamical variable).

The measurement, i.e. attributing a number to some dynamical variable or observable
has in physics subjective as well as objective sense. Namely: the numeric value of some
observable depends as a rule on a setup (the character of motion of laboratory, type of the
measuring device, ﬁeld strength, etc.). However the relationships between numeric values
of dynamical variables and numeric characteristics of laboratory motion, ﬁeld strength,
etc., should be formulated as invariant, since they reﬂect the objective character of the
physical interaction used in the measurement process. The numbers obtained due to the
measurements carry information which does not exist a priori, i.e. before the measurement
process. But the information comprised of subjective as well as objective invariant part
reﬂects the physics of interaction. The last is one of the main topics of quantum ﬁeld
theory. Since each measurement reducible (even if it is unconscious) to the answer of the
question ”yes” or ”no”, it is possible to introduce formally a quantum dynamical variable
”logical spin 1/2” [7] whose coherent states represent the quantum bit of information
”Qubit”.

12

POSTULATE 3
I assume that the invariant i.e. physically essential part of information represented by

the coherent states of the ”logical spin 1/2” is related to the space-time structure.

Such assumption is based on the observation that on one side the space-time is the
manifold of points artiﬁcially depleted of all physical characteristics (material points with-
out reference to masses). In principle arbitrary local coordinates may be attributed to
these points. On the other hand as we know from general relativity the metric struc-
ture depends on the matter distribution and the zero approximation of the metric tensor
gµν = ηµν + ... gives the Lorentz invariant interval. The spinor structure Lorentz trans-
formations represents the transformations of the coherent states of the ”logical spin 1/2”
or ”Qubit”. Thereby we can assume the measurement of the quantum dynamical vari-
ables expressed by the ”Qubit” spinor “creates” the local space-time coordinates. I will
formulate non-linear ﬁeld equations in this local space-time due to a variational principle
referring to the generator of the quantum state deformation.

“Particle” now associated with its “ﬁeld shell” in the dynamical space-time. At each GCS
(π1, ..., πN −1) of the CP (N
1) one has an “expectation value” of LDV’s deﬁned by a
measuring device. But this GCS may by reached along of one of continuum pathes. There-
fore the comparison of two vector ﬁelds and their “expectation values” in neighborhood
points requires some natural rule. The “natural” in our case means that the comparison
has sense only for same “ﬁeld shell”. For this reason one should have a “self-identiﬁcation”
procedure. The aﬃne parallel transport in CP (N
1) of vector ﬁelds is a natural and the
simplest rule for the comparison of generators corresponding “ﬁeld shells”. Physically the
self-identiﬁcation of “particle” at diﬀerent GCS, i.e. setups, literally means that vector
ﬁelds corresponding to its LDV’s are covariant constants relative the Fubini-Study met-
ric. Since we have only the unitary ﬁelds as parameters of GCS transformations I assume
that in accordance with the super-equivalence principle under the inﬁnitesimal shift of
the unitary ﬁeld δΩα in the dynamical space-time, the shifted Hamiltonian ﬁeld should
coincide with the inﬁnitesimal shift of tangent Hamiltonian ﬁeld generated by the parallel
transport in CP (N
1) during NSHP time δτ ). Hence, under small speciﬁc variation of

Let me assume that one has two LDV’s, say, Hamiltonian ~H and momentum ~P . Since
1,2(π, Ω) consist in general all components of Ωα, one should take into account the
F n
commutation relations of the space-time transformations accompanying the inﬁnitesimal
unitary transformations when one tries to determine arbitrary functions arising in PDE
solutions. We can build two ﬁeld equations like (6.11), (6.10). One of them for gauge
ﬁeld representing homogeneous part of Lorentz group E1(Ω) = 0 with the solution Ωs1 =
Ωs1(f1(c2t2
r2). The third one E3(Ω) = 0
t(ux + uy + uz))), containing an arbitrary function
has the solution Ωs3 = Ωs3(f3(r
f3(r
t(ux + uy + uz)). Two nonequivalent equations should have diﬀerent solutions,
but they concern the same “ﬁeld shell” represented by the ρ(t, r)! Let me apply the
equation E3 to the solution Ωs1. This yields E3(Ωs1(f1(c2t2
r2))) = 0, then one will

Ωs3. This yields E1(Ωs3(f3(r
t(ux + uy + uz))) = 0, then one will have a solution for
t(ux + uy + uz)), where u is rotated v. One should ﬁnd the condition of the
f3 = f3(r
self-consistency of these equations generated by LDV’s of Hamiltonian ~H and momentum
~P . I will discuss this problem elsewhere.

Field equations (6.10),(6.11) has relativistic solutions Ωα for the coeﬃcient functions
for the Hamiltonian ﬂow (4.13). Some solutions for the simplest case N = 2 have been

dimension N 2
is now interesting for our aim. This is a diﬃcult task
to analyze the inﬁnite set of so complicated non-linear PDE system. But the increment
of the dimensionality sharply decreases amplitudes of all processes that eﬀectively leads
to ﬁnite dimension problem. Nevertheless, some estimation is encouraging.

last case one, however, should be sure that the ‘transversal’ part of the deformed vector
belongs to the tangent Hilbert space too. Then the natural measure is the length S of

jk is the aﬃne connection. One can treat this behavior of the
tangent state vector as a ﬁnite dimension non-linear model of the “beat out” of the state
vector due to the ‘divergences problem’ [4] from one tangent Hilbert space to another
(Dirac thought that it is “beating out” to nowhere). Then we can assume that the real
divergences problem may be resolved in similar manner:
in the inﬁnite dimension case
there is smooth manifold CP (
) and dynamical quantum state (tangent vector) creeps
from one tangent Hilbert space to another. The convergence is required now only locally in
the speciﬁed tangent Hilbert space (in the sense of the Fubini-Study metric). It should be

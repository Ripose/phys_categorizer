Abstract

Though entropy production is forbidden in standard FRW Cosmology, Berman and Som pre-

sented a simple inﬂationary model where entropy production by bulk viscosity, during standard

inﬂation without ad hoc pressure terms can be accommodated with Robertson-Walker’s metric,

so the requirement that the early Universe be anisotropic is not essential in order to have entropy

growth during inﬂationary phase, as we show. Entropy also grows due to shear viscosity, for the

anisotropic case. The intrinsically inﬂationary metric that we propose can be thought of as deﬁning

a polarized vacuum, and leads directly to the desired eﬀects without the need of introducing extra

pressure terms.

NATURAL ENTROPY PRODUCTION IN AN
INFLATIONARY MODEL FOR A POLARIZED
VACUUM

Marcelo Samuel Berman and

Murari M. Som

I. Introduction

[Note to the reader: this paper was originally prepared around the year 1990. It was

submitted in an earlier version, the referee asked for clariﬁcations, but for some reason, we

made the clarifying in text, but did not re-submit. As it seems to us that the contents is

still adequate, we present it to the archives, at this time.]

Standard FRW Cosmology models do not provide a mechanism for entropy production;

unless one modiﬁes the pressure by including an ad-hoc viscosity term, like in Berman and

Paim[6]. However, Berman and Som[1] presented a special anisotropic model of the Bianchi

type I that undergoes exponential expansion and leads to entropy production directly, with-

out further assumptions. The geometry of the model during inﬂation is described by metric:

ds2 = −dt2 + A2dx2 + B2dy2 + C 2dz2

,

(1.1)

with

A = A0eD1t

B = B0eD2t

C = C0eD3t

,

,

,

(1.2a)

(1.2b)

(1.2c)

where A0, B0, C0 and Di ’s are constants (i = 1, 2, 3)

. This metric can be thought

of as representing a polarized vacuum.

The content of the model is the constant energy density ρ , isotropic constant pressure

p and the trace-free constant anisotropic pressure Πk
i

given by, in units

,

as:

ρ = D1D2 + D2D3 + D3D1

,

p = − 1

3 [ρ + 2 (D2

1 + D2

2 + D3

3)]

,

Πi

i = −3Dσi

i

(no summation)

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

where σi
i

is the shearing tensor and D = 1

3 (D1 + D2 + D3) . We see from (1.5) that

the coeﬃcient of viscosity due to shear is a constant.

The negative isotropic pressure is the usual phenomenon associated with the exponential

expansion,

H = 1

3 (D1 + D2 + D3) = D

.

The conservation of thermal energy is then given by[2]:

T ˙S = Dσi

kσk
i

,

where S is the entropy density and

T is the temperature.

It would be very at-

tractive if we could explain the huge entropy per baryon, denoted by the microwave back-

ground, by physical processes acting in the early, or very early, Universe, as was remarked

by Weinberg[3]. The present work is a step towards that goal, and it will be shown that

the requirement that the Universe undergoes anisotropic inﬂation is not essential to entropy

production, because it does happen in the isotropic case, for isotropic inﬂation.

II. The entropy production due to shear viscosity

To obtain the entropy production, we deﬁne the entropy current according to the second

order dissipative relativistic ﬂuid theories of Israel[4], appropriate to this model,

where β2

is the phenomenological coeﬃcient, S is the equilibrium entropy density and

Sµ = U µ

T S − 1

T (cid:2)

2β2ΠαβΠαβ(cid:3)

,

U µ is the 4-velocity,

U µUµ = 1

.

(2.1)

(2.2)

Taking the divergence of (2.1), one shall obtain, supposing that the time derivative of

β2 is of ﬁrst order,

Sµ;µ = − Πβ

α

T (cid:16)U α

;β + β2 ˙Πα
β (cid:17)

,

(2.3)

where

˙Παβ = Παβ;λU λ

, the semicolon denoting covariant derivative.

From (2.1), we ﬁnd (2.3) by means of the following intermediate steps:

Sµ = U µ

T S − 1

T (cid:2)

T (cid:2)

We now ﬁnd:

(cid:2)

(cid:3);µ

.

(2.3b)

In the case of interest to us, the energy momentum tensor is covariantly divergence-less:

T λµ

;µ = 0

.

In calculating the last term in (2.3b), we can treat U µ

;µ and the time derivatives of β2

T

, as the ﬁrst order quantities, since they vanish for equilibrium[7]. Hence, one obtains:

T Sµ

;µ = −Παβ

(cid:16)Uα;β + β2 ˙Παβ(cid:17)

.

Equation (2.3) gives the rate of entropy production per unity volume. The second law of

thermodynamics (Sµ;µ > 0) will be satisﬁed identically if:

β = −2n hU α;β +β2 ˙Πα
Πα
βi

,

(2.4)

where the positive coeﬃcient of proportionality n is the coeﬃcient of the shear viscosity.

From (1.5) we have

˙Πα

β = 0 , and 2n = 3D = constant. Thus in Bianchi I type model

the entropy grows in a constant rate. The coeﬃcient of shear viscosity is n = 3

2 H .

During the period of inﬂation, the physical entropy is given by:

4

S0 = S − τ D2

T σαβ σαβ

,

(2.5)

where S is the equilibrium entropy density, and,

τ = 9

2β2

.

III. Entropy production in the isotropic case

Let us consider the case of a small anisotropy such as:

D1 = D0 + α

D2 = D0 + β

D3 = D0 + γ

,

,

,

where α, β and γ

are small quantities.

From (1.3) and (1.4) one obtains, neglecting the second order terms,

ρ ∼

= 3D2

0 + 6D0(α + β + γ)

,

p = − 1

3 [9D2

0 + 10D0(α + β + γ)]

.

From (3.1) and (3.2) one ﬁnds that:

p = −3D2

0 + 10

3 D0(α + β + γ)

,

up to the ﬁrst order.

In the isotropic exponential expansion one has:

p = −3D2

0 = −ρ

,

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

which is the usual vacuum state condition for the inﬂationary model.

If we impose the condition p = −ρ , then relation (1.4) yields:

D2

1 + D2

2 + D2

3 = D1D2 + D2D3 + D3D1

,

(3.5)

5

leading to D1 = D2 = D3

. However, for a vacuum state cosmology in a Biachi I

space-time, one needs, apart from a shear viscosity, a bulk viscosity given by:

Π = − 2

3 [D1D2 + D2D3 + D3D1 + D1 + D2 + D3]

.

(3.6)

This leads to the modiﬁcation of (2.1). The entropy current takes the form:

Sµ ≈ SU µ − 1

β0Π2 + β2ΠαβΠαβ(cid:3)

2 (cid:2)

U µ
T

,

(3.7)

where β0

is a phenomenological coeﬃcient. The inclusion of the bulk viscosity further

augments the rate of production of entropy in the general case.

IV. Conclusions

The requirement that the early Universe be anisotropic is not essential in order to have

entropy growth during inﬂation. We showed that entropy grows, due to bulk and shear

viscosity, in the anisotropic case. An estimate of the maximum rate at which the entropy of

the primordial plasma increases in the presence of a homogeneous shear, and the minimum

entropy increase, were calculated by Vischniac[5]; who also discussed the physical mechanism

underlying our proposed shear viscosity, which can be achieved through a massive scalar ﬁeld

interacting with a massive gauge ﬁeld. The interest in our model resides in the natural way

of entropy production, without adding ad-hoc viscosity terms to the pressure; all one has to

do is deﬁne the vacuum polarization metric (1.1) and apply Einstein’s equations.

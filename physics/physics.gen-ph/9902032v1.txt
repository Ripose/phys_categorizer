Abstract

The Dirac equation is deduced from the probability properties by

the Poincare group transformations.

The probability is denoted as the elementary lepton probability if for
this probability density vector the spinor Ψ exists which is element of some
natural evolution operator space and which obeys to (1).

Therefore the physics elementary particle behavior in the vacuum looks
like to the trackelike probability behavior. That is if the partition with two
slits between the source of the physics particle and the detecting screen exists
in the vacuum then the interference of the probability is observed. But if this
system shall be placed in the Wilson cloud chamber then the particle shall
got the clear trace, marked by the condensate drops, and whole interference
shall vanished. It looks like to the following: the physics particle exists in
the moment, only, in which some event on this particle is happening. And
in other times this particle does not exist and the probability of some event
on this particle exists, only.

Hence, if events on this particle do not happen between the event-birth
and the event-detection then the particle behavior is the probability behavior
between these events, and the interference is visible. But in the Wilson cloud
chamber, where the ionization acts are form the almost continuous line, the
particle has got the clear trace and no the interference. And the particle
moves because such line is not absolutely continuous. Every point of the
ionization act has got the neighboring ionization point, and the event on
this particle is not happen between these points. Therefore, the physics
particle moves because the corresponding probability is propagated in the
space between these points.

Abstract

Since particle such as molecule, atom and nucleus are
composite particle, it is important to recognize that physics
must be invariant for both the composite particle and its
constituent particles,
this requirement is called particle
invariance. But diﬃculties arise immediately because for
fermion we use the Dirac equation, for boson we use the
Klein-Gordon equation. Therefore, the particle invariance
demands there is a general wave equation for describing

three advances in this subject are reported: (1) momentum-
wavefunction relation is a general relation shared by both
fermion and boson, meets the requirement of the particle
invaiance. As a test, the momentum-wavefunction relation
was directly applied to hydrogen atom, and get the correct
ﬁne structure and spin eﬀect for the electron.

where we regard the momentum as momentum itself but
not momentum operator, please note that Eq.(3) is not
the Klein-Gordon wave equation. In the recent years, H
Y Cui has studied this equation for many years, it was
found that by solving Eq.(3) for hydrogen atom, the ﬁne
structure of hydrogen energy can be calculated correctly,
while its wavefunction has only single component in con-
trast with Dirac’s wavefunction, the spin eﬀect of electron
is also revealed by Eq.(3) when the hydrogen atom is in
a magnetic ﬁeld[2][3][4]. It was also found that the Dirac
wave equation and Klein-Cordon wave equation can be
derived out from Eq.(3) when we abandon some higher
order terms or nonlinear terms[5]. These results are eas-
ily understood regarding that Eq.( 1) is a general relation
shared by both fermion and boson, or any other particle.
In the present paper, we mainly report that a path
integral method based on the momentum-wavefunction
relation was developed, it diﬀers from Feynman’s path
integral; as a test, the spin eﬀect of electron are calcu-
lated by using the path integral method, giving out cor-
rect results. It was shown that the path integral method
is a rapid quantum computation method which satisﬁes
the particle invariance.

1 Introduction

Consider a particle of rest mass m and charge q moving
in an inertial frame of reference with relativistic 4-vector
velocity uµ, it satisﬁes[1]

uµuµ =

where there is not distinction between covariant and con-
travariant components in the Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem. Let Aµ denote vector potential of electromagnetic
ﬁeld, substituting the momentum-wavefunction relation

the Eq.(1), the momentum components satisfy

In a spherical polar coordinate system (r, θ, ϕ, ict), the
nucleus of hydrogen atom provides a spherically symmet-
ric potential V (r) = e/r for the electron (q =
e), the
displacement elements and vector potential are given by

In the usual spectroscopic notation of quantum me-

used to specify the state of an electron in an atom. After
the comparison, we get the relations between the usual

According to Eq.(56), for a ﬁxed (n, l), equivalent to

But our work works on it without spin concept, the so-
called spin eﬀect has been revealed by Eq.(60) without
spin concept, this result indicates that electronic spin is
a kind of orbital motion. In Stern-Gerlach experiment,
the angular momentum of ground state of hydrogen atom
is presumed to be zero according to the usual quantum
mechanics, thus ones need make use of the spin. But
in the present calculation, the so-called spin has been
merged with the orbital motion of the electron.

Spin concept objects to particle invariance, bear in

mind that simplicity is always a merit for the physics.

5 Discussion

1. inﬂuence of nucleus motion

Since the nucleus and the electron in hydrogen atom
consists an atom system with a rest center of mass, the
nucleus is moving, therefore, the nucleus should provide
a modiﬁed Coulomb’ force which contains both electric
ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld for the electron. In the author’s
previous paper[8], the modiﬁed Coubomb’s 4-force f is
expressed in the Minkowsky space as (ref. to Fig.1 in the
paper)

f =

kqq′
c2r3 [(u

·

X)u′

(u

·

−

u′)X]

(62)

If we consider the nucleus inﬂuence on the electron, then
the calculation of hydrogen atom can be improved fur-
ther.

2. gyrated state
To note that Jz and J are the magnitudes of the an-
gular momentum vector and its z-axis component, since
they are constants, the direction of the angular momen-
tum vector is deﬁnitely uncertain, thus, there are two
kinds of state: (1) when Jz = J, the direction of J is in
the z-axis, the state of electron motion is in a circular or
= J, the state should be gy-
elliptical orbit; (2) when Jz 6
rated state, i.e. J vector keeps its magnitude unchanged
but varies its direction, this state can only appear in non
Coulomb’s ﬁeld by the nucleus or external ﬁeld.

3. rapid quantum computation
Since the path integral method for quantum mechan-
ics needs not to evaluate quantum wave equation (2 order
or nonlinear ones), it deﬁnitely is a rapid quantum com-
putation method. This path integral method provides
a great prospects for computer computation in some re-
search ﬁelds such as Xα, ab-initio, LMTO, DV, etc.

The path integral method developed in the present pa-

per diﬀers essentially from Feynman’s path integral.

4. the particle invariance in particle physics
Since particles such as molecules, atoms and nuclei
are composite particles, it is important to recognize that
physics must be invariant for both the composite parti-
cles and their constituent particles, this requirement is
called particle invariance[6].

To note that the Eq.(4) is suitable for any kind of par-
ticle, therefore, it satisﬁes the particle invariance in par-
ticle physics.

5. the explanation of the wavefunction
The wavefunction ψ we employed in the calculation
for hydrogen atom diﬀers from the wave function in the
usual quantum mechanics, because it was found that the
wavefunction ψ keeps
= 1 everywhere in the hydro-
gen atom. But this kind of wavefunction can interfer-
ence with each other, for the detail discussion see the
papers[9][6].

Using equation

R

a path integral method for calculating quantum state of
a particle was developed. The approach has a great ad-
it is a rapid computation method, because it
vantage:
needs only to evaluate integration for quantum problem,
instead of solving quantum wave equation as in usual
quantum mechanics.

In this paper, three advances in the particle invari-
ance are reported: (1) momentum-wavefunction relation
is a general relation shared by both fermion and bo-
son, meets the requirement of the particle invariance.
As an example, the momentum-wavefunction relation
was directly applied to hydrogen atom, and get the cor-
rect ﬁne structure and spin eﬀect for the electron. (2)
the Dirac equation and Klein-Gordon equation can be

4

derived out from the momentum-wavefunction relation
when we abandon some higher order terms. (3) according
to the momentum-wavefunction relation a path integral
method was developed , diﬀering from Feynman’s path
integral, it simpliﬁes quantum computation.

The present calculation is characterized by using the
usual momentum-wavefunction relation directly, it pro-
vides an insight into the foundations of quantum me-
chanics. The particle invariance is a basic principle for
particle physics.

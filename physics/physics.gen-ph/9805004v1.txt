THE PHYSICS SPACE DIMENSION

All fermions and all interactions between fermions are expressed by

the Cayley numbers in our space-time.

⋄ 3+1 SPACE-TIME
Let A(t, −→x ) be the event, which can be expressed as: ”The particle eA is
detected in the space point −→x at the time moment t” and B(t0, −→x0) - as: ”The
particle eB is detected in the space point −→x0 at the time moment t0”.
Let ρ(t, −→x ) be the probability density of the event A. That is

equals to the probability to detect the particle eA in the space domain V at the
time moment t.

Let ρc(t, −→x |t0, −→x0) be the conditional probability density of the event A for

the event B. That is

equals to the probability to detect the particle eA in the space domain V at the
time moment t, if the particle eB is detected in the space point −→x0 at the time
moment t0.

In this case, if

ρc(t, −→x |t0, −→x0 ) = g(t, −→x |t0, −→x0) · ρ(t, −→x ),
then the function g(t, −→x |t0, −→x0) is the interaction function for eA and eB. If
g(t, −→x |t0, −→x0) = 1 then the particles eA and eB do not interact.

In the Quantum Theory a probability density equals to the quadrate of
the state vector module. A fermion state vector is the 4-component complex
vector. Hence, a fermion state vector has got 8 real components. Therefore,

some conformity between such vectors and the octaves (the Cayley numbers)
can be determined.

Let ρ = Ψ† · Ψ and ρc = Ψ†

c · Ψc. Here: Ψ and Ψc are the 4-component

complex state vectors. And Ψ and Ψc are the octaves by this conformity.

Because the Cayley algebra is the division algebra, then the octave ϕ exists,

for which: Ψc = ϕ • Ψ (here • is the symbol of the algebra Cayley product).
Because the Cayley algebra is the normalized algebra, then g = ϕ† · ϕ.
Therefore, all fermion interactions can be expressed by the octaves in the

3 + 1 space-time.

⋄ µ+1 SPACE-TIME
Let us consider the probability density ρ (t, −→x ) [1] for some point-event

A (t, −→x ) in the µ + 1 space-time. That is

d−→x · ρ (t, −→x )

Z
(V )

is the probability for A to happen in the space domain (V ) at the time moment
t in the µ + 1 space-time.

is the probability density µ + 1vector.

The Cliﬀord set of the range s is the set K of the s × s complex matrices for

which:

1) if γ ∈ K then γ2 = 1 (here 1 is the identity s × s matrix);
2) if γ ∈ K and β ∈ K then γ · β + β · γ = 0 (here 0 is the zero s × s matrix);
3) There does not exist the s × s matrix ζ which anticommutates with all K

elements, for which ζ2 = 1, and which is not the element of K.

For example, the Cliﬀord pentad

[3] is the Cliﬀord set of

β1, β2, β3, β4, γ0

(cid:11)

the range 4.

By [4] for every natural number z the Cliﬀord set of the range 2z exists.
For every probability density vector

Let ρc(t, −→x |t0, −→x0) be the conditional probability density of the event A for

the event B, but in the µ + 1 space-time, too. And if

ρc(t, −→x |t0, −→x0 ) = g(t, −→x |t0, −→x0) · ρ(t, −→x ),
then the function g(t, −→x |t0, −→x0 ) is the interaction function for eA and eB, too,
but in the µ + 1 space-time.

c · Ψc.

Let Ψc and Ψ be the s-spinors, for which: ρ = Ψ† · Ψ and ρc = Ψ†
Let Ψc and Ψ are the elements of the algebra ℑ with the product ∗, and for
every Ψc and Ψ the element ϕ of ℑ exists, for which: Ψc = ϕ ∗ Ψ and ϕ† · ϕ = g.
In this case ℑ is the division normalized algebra and the ℑ dimension is not
more than 8 from the Hurwitz theorem [6] (The every normalized algebra with
the unit is isomorphic to alone from the followings: the real numbers algebra R,
the quaternions algebra K, or the octaves algebra ´O) and from the generalized
Frobenius theorem [7] (The division algebras have got the dimension 1,2,4 or
8, only). Therefore, the Cliﬀord set matrices size are not more than 4 × 4
(the Cliﬀord matrices are the complex matrices). Such Cliﬀord set contains not
more than 5 elements. The diagonal elements of this pentad deﬁnes the space,
in which the physics particle move. This space dimension is not more than 3
[8]. Hence, in this case we have got 3+1 space.

If µ > 3 then for every algebra the interaction functions exist, which do not
belong to this algebra. I’m name such interactions as the supernatural for this
algebra interactions.
⋄ RESUME
1. All fermions and all interactions between fermions are expressed by the

octaves in our space-time.

2. The probability, which is deﬁned by the relativistic µ + 1-vector of the

probability density, fulﬁls to the Quantum Theory principles.

3. In the µ+1 space-time:

if µ ≤ 3 then the supernatural interactions do

not happen, if µ > 3 then the supernatural interactions happen.

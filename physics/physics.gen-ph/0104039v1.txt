of the Accelerated Bodies Masses (Principle of Equivalence is Not Absolute in the

In the frame of the multifractal theory of time and space ( in this model our universe is consisting
of real time and space ﬁelds and is the multifractal universe) in the works [1]- [?] some of problems
were analyzed: how the fractional dimensions of real ﬁelds of time and space inﬂuence on behavior
of diﬀerent physical phenomena. In this paper it is shown that in the multifractal theory of time
and space the corrections of general relativity to Newton gravitational forces are explaining very
simple in Newton approach. It is shown also that there is dependence (though very small) of bodies
gravitational acceleration from their masses, so the principle of equivalence in multifractal universe
is not absolute and it is only a very good approach. Thus taking into account the multifractal
dimensions of time gives small corrections to gravitation forces of Einstein general relativity and
−1 where Fg is the
explain it in Newton approach. These corrections are equal to Fg(r0ma)(M rm)
gravitational force originated by mass M at the distance r where the mass m is located, r0 is the
gravitational radius of the mass M and the rm is the mean radius of the mass m, a is a numerical
factor depending of distribution of masses of m . The possibility of experimental checking this eﬀect
in weak gravitational ﬁelds is analyzed . It makes for perihelion of Mercury rotation the correction to
known results of Einstein relativity. This correction is equal ∼ 0, 5 of percent of Einstein corrections.

I. INTRODUCTION

The fractal model of space and time (Kobelev [1]- [16])
treats the time and the space with fractional dimensions
as real ﬁelds. Some information about the physical model
of time and space based on these works we use in this pa-
per. Our universe is formed only by these ﬁelds , i.e. uni-
verse is fractional real material time and fractional real
material space and all other ﬁelds are born by the ﬁelds
of time and space. As the time and the space are ma-
terial ﬁelds with fractional dimensions and multifractal
structure (multifractal sets,) they are deﬁned on the sets
of their carriers of measure (physical vacuum of our uni-
verse). In each the time (or the space) point ( ”points”
are approach for very small ”intervals” of time or space
and ”intervals” are the multifractal sets with global di-
mensions for their sets, that play role of local dimensions
for universe in whole) the fractional dimensions of time
(or space) determine the densities of Lagrangians energy
for all physical ﬁelds ( or the new physical ﬁelds for space)
in these points. Time and space are binding by relation
dr2 − c2dt2 = 0 (this relation is only a good approach,

more precise relations see at [1]- [2]). As the real ﬁelds
time and space own by huge supply of energy ( the ques-
tion about their energy was considered partly at [16])
and these energies may be evaluated. The purpose of
this paper is more detailed consideration of very impor-
tant problem ( in the frame of mathematical formalism
of the multifractal model of time and space introduced
in the papers of Kobelev and presented in [1]- [16]): are
the dependence of acceleration of any body with mass m
at its mass exists or not exists (if acceleration is born by
gravitational force)? The general relativity is based on
the principle of equivalence and deny the positive answer
on this question a priori. A posteriori this problem had
not decided till now, because, as it seems, the all exper-
iments had fulﬁlled till now have small unexplained cor-
rections. For example, the Mercury perihelium rotation
has unexplained corrections to general relativity results
that consist 0.5. percent of general relativity corrections.
The multifractal theory of time and space may explain
this correction and gives dependence of acceleration of
body at its mass (though very small). Thus the principle
of equivalence of general relativity lose its absolute char-

1

acter and become a good approach principle. The reason
of it lay in the multifractal nature of time and space,
i.e. in the multifractal nature of our universe. Time and
space build up the universe and by means of their mul-
tifractal dimensions construct the known picture of all
physical ﬁelds. So the FD of mass of moving body have
dependence of gravitational energy (see Kobelev [1]- [3])
and this dependence is not be cancelled even in Newton
equation (the latter is the rude approach of scalar grav-
itation or the registration only the scalar component of
tensor gravitational ﬁeld). The fractional dimensions of
time give the corrections to gravitational forces such as
corrections of general gravity plus additional correction
depending of accelerated bodies masses . We analyze the
value of the corrections born by this eﬀect and consider
as example the Mercury perihelium rotation. Note that
the general relativity postulating of principle of equiv-
alence not be rigorous in the multifractal universe and
because of the other simple reason: all systems of refer-
ence in real time and space ﬁelds of multifractal universe
are absolute systems and can be diﬀerentiate one of an-
other because of absolute character of time-space ﬁelds
and connection of system of reference with absolute ﬁelds.
Only the smallness of fractional corrections to topologi-
cal time dimension in our domain of universe allows to
use the principle of equivalence as a very good approach
in our life and science and it works beautiful though it is
not rigorous .

II. NEWTON EQUATIONS IN THE
MULTIFRACTAL UNIVERSE

In this paragraph we write down the modiﬁed Newton
equations in the multifractal time universe in the pres-
ence of gravitational forces only (see [1]- [3])

In the Eq.(2) the constant b−1
g has order of size of universe
and is introduced with purpose to extend the class of
functions on which the generalized fractional derivatives
concept is applicable. These equations are not a closed
system because of presence of the fractionality of spa-
tial dimensions. Therefore we approximate the fractional
derivatives with respect to space coordinate as Ddr
+,r ≈ ∇,
i.e. approximate them by usual space derivatives. In the
Eqs. (1)-(2) is used the integral functionals Ddt
+,t (both
left-sided and right-sided) which are suitable to describe
the dynamics of functions deﬁned on multifractal sets
(see [1]- [3], [7]). These functionals are simple and nat-
ural generalization of the Riemann-Liouville fractional
derivatives and integrals and read:

Dd

(4)

where Γ(x) is Euler’s gamma function, and a and b are
some constants from [0, ∞). In these deﬁnitions, as usu-
ally for Riemann-Liouville derivatives, n = {d} + 1 ,
where {d} is the integer part of d if d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤
d < n) and n = 0 for d < 0. If d = const, the gener-
alized fractional derivatives (GFD) (3)-(4) coincide with
the Riemann - Liouville fractional derivatives (d ≥ 0) or
fractional integrals (d < 0). When d = n+ε(t), ε(t) → 0,
GFD can be represented by means of integer derivatives
and integrals. For n = 1, i.e. d = 1 + ε, |ε| << 1 it is
possible to obtain:

D1+ε

ε(r(t), t)f (r(t), t)

where a is a constant and determined by choice of the
rules of regularization of integrals ( [1]- [2], [7]) (for more
detailed see [7]) and the last additional member in the
right hand side of (5) is very small (in this member the t
in the denominator begins from ”big-bang”) so when the
problem of irreversibility is not researching this member
may be omitted . The selection of the rule of regulariza-
tion that gives a real additives for usual derivative in (3)
yield a = 0.5 or a = 1 for d < 1 [1]. The functions under
the integral sign in the (3)-(4) we consider as the general-
ized functions deﬁned on the set of the ﬁnite functions or
Gelfand functions [21]. The notions of the GFD, similar
to (3)-(4), can also be deﬁned and for the space variables
r. The deﬁnitions of GFD (3)-(4) need in the connec-
tions between the fractal dimensions of time dt(r(t), t)
and the characteristics of physical ﬁelds (say, potentials
Φi(r(t), t), i = 1, 2, ..) or densities of Lagrangians Li) and
it was deﬁned in cited works. Following [1]- [15], we de-
ﬁne this connection by the relation

dt(r(t), t) = 1 +

βiLi(Φi(r(t), t))

(6)

Xi

where Li are densities of energy (Lagrangian densities) of
physical ﬁelds, βi are dimensional constants with physi-
cal dimension of [Li]−1 (it is worth to choose β′
i in the
form β′
i = a−1βi for the sake of independence from the
regularization constant and select the β = M c2 where
M is the mass of the body that born considered gravita-
tional ﬁeld). The deﬁnition of the time as the system of
subsets and deﬁnition of the FD for dt (see (6)) connects
the value of fractional (fractal) dimension dt(r(t), t) with
each time instant t. The latter depends both on time

2

t and coordinates r. If dt = 1 (an absence of physical
ﬁelds) the set of time has topological dimension equal to
unity. We bound consideration only the case when rela-
tions dt = 1−ε(r(t), t)), |ε| ≪ 1 are fulﬁlled. In that case
the GFD (as was shown in [7] ) may be represented (as a
good approach) by ordinary derivatives and relation (1),
(5)) are valid. Now we can determine the dt for distances
much larger than the gravitational radius r0 (for prob-
lem of a body motion in the ﬁeld of spherical-symmetric
gravitating center) as (see [1] for more details)

dt ≈ 1 + βgΦg + βgΦm

(7)

where P hig is the gravitational potential born by the
mass M in the center of body with mass m, Φm is the
gravitational potential born by the body with mass m in
its center. So the equations (1)-(2) reed ( we used for
GFD approach of (5)( [16]))

r = Fg

where

Fg = −∇

, ε = βg(Φg + Φm)

(9)

We had neglected by the fractional parts of spatial di-
mensions and by the contributions from the term with
g . Now we take the βg as βg = c−2 for potentials (or
b−1
β = (M c)−2 for Lagrangian density L). Let the body
with mass m moves in the gravitational ﬁeld of the body
with mass M on the distance r (r >> r0) where r0 is the
gravitational radius of the body with mass M ) and let
M >> m. Then it is possible to consider these bodies as
points masses. Now we more precisely calculate correc-
tions to the time dimensions in the Eq.(9). At the point
r, where is a center of point mass m, there are two contri-
butions in the FD of dt: one is caused by the ﬁeld of the
body with mass M , another is caused by the mean grav-
itational ﬁeld of the body with mass m and with mean
radius rm . The latter is

Φm =

amγ
rm

where a is number factor deﬁning by distribution of mass
within body with mass m. This factor is near unity ( for
uniform distribution it equal 1.5). If we want to describe
the Mercury perihelium rotation, than it is necessary to
use the law of conservation of energy . From the energy
conservation law (now this law is only approximate law
( though a very good for dt ∼ 1) since our theory and
mathematical approaches have used apply only to open
systems) obtain

Here we used the approximate relation between the
generalized fractional derivative and usual integer-order
derivative (5),(8) and notations corresponding to conven-
tional description of the motion of mass m near grav-
itating center M again. The Eq.(10) diﬀers from the
corresponding classical limit of the equations of general
relativity by the presence of additional terms in the ﬁrst
square bracket of the left-hand part of the equation and
the parentheses in the square bracket in the right-hand
part of this equation. The ﬁrst term describes the ve-
locity alteration during gyration and is negligible in the
case, when perihelion gyration of Mercury is calculated.
If we neglect by it, then the Eq.(10) reduces to the cor-
responding classical limit of general relativity equation
with the correction born by breaking the principle of
equivalence. For large energy densities (e.g., gravita-
tional ﬁeld at r < r0) the Eqs.(1)-(2) contain no divergen-
cies [1] since integral-diﬀerential operators of the general-
ized fractional diﬀerentiation reduced to the generalized
fractional integrals (see (1)-(4)).

III. IS GRAVITATIONAL ACCELERATION
DEPENDS OF THE MASS OF THE
ACCELERATED BODY?

In this paragraph we consider the problem of limited
validity of the principle of equivalence of the general rel-
ativity. It is well known that the principle of equivalence
( i.e. the independence of acceleration of body with mass
m given by the gravitational ﬁeld of it mass) is the base of
the general theory of relativity. Is this principle rigorous
or only the good approach? In the multifractal universe
(our universe is non-closed system ) all the laws and the
principle that rigorous for closed systems are not rigorous
and are only the good approaches for domain of universe
where physical forces are small and so the fractional cor-
rections to the dimensions of time and space are small
too. Now we demonstrate an approximate character of
this principle by calculating corrections to gravitational
force in the space with fractional dimensions of time for
the case of classic limit (Newton equation, see the ( [3]).
In that case the Eq.(8) reads (r0 = 2γM

c2 and a = 1, 5)

The right-hand part of the Eq.(12) describes the gravita-
tion force applied to the body placed in the central gravi-
tational ﬁeld with the correction of general relativity and
the extra correction because of violation of principle of
equivalence (the member with dependence of mass m).

IV. EXPERIMENTAL CHECKING

The gravitational force deﬁned by relation (12) may
be estimated for diﬀerent physical phenomena. It gives
for eﬀect of Mercury perihelium rotation the additional
correction near 0.004a of corrections of general relativity
and results to full coincidence the experimental data for
this eﬀect and theoretical calculations. We stress that in
multifractal universe there is dependence of the gravita-
tional acceleration from mass of accelerated body. That
dependence is very small in the considered case, but has
principal role and shows the limitation of the principle
of equivalence. Such dependence is natural for the mul-
tifractal universe, as all systems of reference in it are
absolute systems. So any equivalence of them is treated
as approximation (very good in the domains with almost
topological dimensions of time and space). Let us write
the relation for relative change of part of acceleration
depending of mass the accelerating body

a − Fg
a

=

(1 +

)

(13)

The Eq. (13) allows to estimate the role of breaking of the
principle of equivalence for diﬀerent physical phenomena.
It is easy examine that our conclusions do not contradict
the experiments in this domain and give small corrections
to theoretical calculations of general relativity .

V. CONCLUSIONS

The main results of paper are:

1. It is demonstrated the existence of very small grav-
itational acceleration in the multifractal universe with
dependence of masses of accelerated bodies;
2. Our result testify about of non-absolute character of
the equivalence principle of the general relativity, but al-
lows to use it as a very good approximated law for the
weak gravitational ﬁelds;
3. We pay attention also that for describing the exper-
iments which usually are explained only by the general
relativity, in the fractal theory of time and space for for
this purpose it is enough the approach of Newton equa-
tion in the time with fractional dimensions. Certainly,
the consideration of relativistic tensor gravitation ﬁelds
gives the same results in the classic limit.

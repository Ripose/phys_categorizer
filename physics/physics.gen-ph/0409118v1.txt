are not Covariant upon the Lorentz Transformations but
upon the Standard Transformations. The New Lorentz

In this paper the Lorentz transformations (LT) and the standard transforma-
tions (ST) of the usual Maxwell equations (ME) with the three-dimensional
(3D) vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B respectively, are
examined using both the geometric algebra and tensor formalisms. Diﬀerent
4D algebric objects are used to represent the usual observer dependent and
the new observer independent electric and magnetic ﬁelds. It is found that
the ST of the ME diﬀer from their LT and consequently that the ME with the
3D E and B are not covariant upon the LT but upon the ST. The obtained
results do not depend on the character of the 4D algebric objects used to
represent the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equa-
tions are presented with 1-vectors E and B, bivectors EHv and BHv and the
abstract tensors, the 4-vectors Ea and Ba. All these quantities are deﬁned
without reference frames, i.e., as absolute quantities. When some basis has
been introduced, they are represented as coordinate-based geometric quan-
tities comprising both components and a basis. It is explicitly shown that
this geometric approach agrees with experiments, e.g., the Faraday disk, in
all relatively moving inertial frames of reference, which is not the case with
the usual approach with the 3D E and B and their ST.

KEY WORDS: standard and Lorentz transformations of Maxwell equations.

1. INTRODUCTION

Recently it is shown in the tensor formalism(1) and the geometric (Cliﬀord)
algebra formalism,(2) that the standard transformations (ST)(3,4) (see also the
well-known textbooks, e.g. Refs. 5,6) of the three-dimensional (3D) vectors
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B respectively, drastically diﬀer

1

from the correct Lorentz transformations (LT) of the corresponding 4D alge-
bric objects representing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The fundamental
diﬀerence is that in the ST, e.g., the components of the transformed 3D E′
st
are expressed by the mixture of components of the 3D E and B, and sim-
ilarly for B′
st. However, the correct LT always transform the 4D algebric
object representing the electric ﬁeld only to the electric ﬁeld, and similarly
for the magnetic ﬁeld. The results from(1,2) are used here to investigate the
LT and the ST of the usual Maxwell equations (ME) with the 3D E and
B. Diﬀerent 4D algebric objects are used to represent the standard observer
dependent and the new observer independent electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
First the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are represented by the observer depen-
dent 1-vectors Ef and Bf deﬁned in the γ0 - frame. The usual ME in the
component form are derived in Sec. 2.1. The LT of the ME are considered
in Sec. 2.3. It is explicitly shown in Sec. 2.3., using the correct LT of Ef
and Bf , that the Lorentz transformed ME are not of the same form as the
original ones. This proves that, contrary to the general opinion, the usual
ME are not Lorentz covariant equations. In Sec. 2.4. the ST of the usual
ME are considered taking into account the ST of the components of the 3D
E and B. It is proved that both the ST of the 3D E and B and the ST
of the usual ME have nothing in common with the correct LT. The new
in which the
Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations are constructed in Sec. 2.6.
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are represented by the 1-vectors E and B that
are deﬁned without reference frames. The whole consideration is brieﬂy re-
peated in the same sections using the observer dependent bivectors EH and
BH deﬁned in the γ0 - frame and the coordinate-free bivectors EHv and BHv.
In the geometric algebra formalism the active LT are used. This geometric
approach is compared with the usual manner in which the ME with the 3D
E and B are obtained from the covariant ME with F µν, Sec. 2.2., and from
the Lorentz transformed F ′µν, Sec. 2.5.. In Sec. 3. the whole consideration
is performed in the tensor formalism using the coordinate-free 4-vectors Ea
and Ba and the observer dependent 4-vectors Ea
f deﬁned in the γ0
- frame. In the tensor formalism the passive LT are used. All quantities in
the Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations, with 1-vectors E and B, bivectors EHv
and BHv and the abstract 4-vectors Ea and Ba are geometric, coordinate-
free quantities, i.e., the absolute quantities (AQs). They are deﬁned without
reference frames, or, when some basis has been introduced, they are repre-
sented as coordinate-based geometric quantities (CBGQs) comprising both
components and a basis. All such equations are completely equivalent to the

f and Ba

2

ﬁeld equations with F (given, e.g. in Refs.7-9 and discussed in detail in(10))
or with F ab (already presented, e.g., in Ref. 11). It can be concluded from
the consideration presented in all mentioned sections that the diﬀerence be-
tween the ST and the LT of the ME does not depend on the character of
the 4D algebric objects used to represent the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
The comparison with experiments is given in Sec. 4. and it shows that this
geometric approach agrees with experiments, e.g., the Faraday disk, in all
relatively moving inertial frames of reference, which is not the case with the
usual approach with the 3D E and B and their ST. (The comparison of the
geometric approach to special relativity (SR) and of the standard formula-
tion of SR with experiments that test SR is also given in detail in Ref. 12.)
The summary and conclusions are presented in Sec. 5. (We note that the
great part of the consideration exposed in this paper is also presented in Ref.
13.)

2. THE PROOF OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LT
AND THE ST OF THE ME USING THE GEOMETRIC
ALGEBRA APPROACH

For the usual formulation of electrodynamics with the Cliﬀord multivec-
tors, see, e.g., Refs. 7-9. In Refs. 7-9 the electromagnetic ﬁeld is represented
by a bivector-valued function F = F (x) on the spacetime. The source of
the ﬁeld is the electromagnetic current j which is a 1-vector ﬁeld and the
gradient operator ∂ is also 1-vector. A single ﬁeld equation for F is ﬁrst
given by M. Riesz(14) as

∂F = j/ε0c,

∂ · F + ∂ ∧ F = j/ε0c.

(1)

The trivector part is identically zero in the absence of magnetic charge. The
geometric (Cliﬀord) product is written by simply juxtaposing multivectors
AB. The dot ′·′ and wedge ′∧′ in (1) denote the inner and outer products
respectively. All quantities in (1) are AQs. Thence they are independent
of the reference frame and the chosen system of coordinates in that frame.
Consequently the equation (1) is a Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equation. In the
geometric algebra formalism (as in the tensor formalism as well) one mainly
deals either with 4D AQs, e.g., the Cliﬀord multivector F (the abstract tensor
F ab) or, when some basis has been introduced, with CBGQs that comprise
both components and a basis. The SR that exclusively deals with AQs or,

3

equivalently, with CBGQs, can be called the invariant SR.(11,12,10,15) The
reason for this name is that upon the passive LT any 4D CBGQ remains
unchanged. The invariance of some 4D CBGQ upon the passive LT reﬂects
the fact that such mathematical, invariant, geometric 4D quantity represents
the same physical object for relatively moving observers. It is taken in the
invariant SR that such 4D geometric quantities are well-deﬁned not only
mathematically but also experimentally, as measurable quantities with real
physical meaning. Thus they do have an independent physical reality.

In the usual geometric algebra formalism, e.g., Refs. 7-9, instead of to
work only with such observer independent quantities one introduces (in order
to get a more familiar form for (1)) a space-time split and the relative vectors
in the γ0 - frame, i.e., a particular time-like direction γ0 is singled out. γ0 is
tangent to the world line of an observer at rest in the γ0 - frame.

(The generators of the spacetime algebra are four basis vectors γµ, µ =
0...3, satisfying γµ · γν = ηµν = diag(+ − −−). They form the standard
basis {γµ}. This basis is a right-handed orthonormal frame of vectors in
the Minkowski spacetime M 4 with γ0 in the forward light cone. The γk
(k = 1, 2, 3) are spacelike vectors. The γµ generate by multiplication a com-
plete basis for spacetime algebra: 1, γµ, γµ ∧ γν, γµγ5,γ5 (16 independent ele-
ments). γ5 is the pseudoscalar for the frame {γµ} . It is worth noting that the
standard basis corresponds, in fact, to the speciﬁc system of coordinates, i.e.,
to Einstein’s system of coordinates. In the Einstein system of coordinates
the Einstein synchronization(4) of distant clocks and Cartesian space coordi-
nates xi are used in the chosen inertial frame of reference. However diﬀerent
systems of coordinates of an inertial frame of reference are allowed and they
are all equivalent in the description of physical phenomena. For example,
in(11) two very diﬀerent, but completely equivalent systems of coordinates,
the Einstein system of coordinates and ”radio” (”r”) system of coordinates,
are exposed and exploited throughout the paper. In this paper, for the sake
of brevity and of clearness of the whole exposition, we shall work only with
the standard basis {γµ}, but remembering that the approach with 4D quan-
tities that are deﬁned without reference frames holds for any choice of the
basis.)

The bivector ﬁeld F is decomposed in the γ0 - frame into electric and
magnetic parts using diﬀerent algebric objects to represent these ﬁelds. The
explicit appearance of γ0 in these expressions implies that the space-time split
is observer dependent and thus all quantities obtained by the space-time split
in the γ0 - frame are observer dependent quantities. In Refs. 7,8 the observer

4

independent F ﬁeld from (1) is expressed in terms of observer dependent
quantities, i.e., as the sum of a relative vector EH and a relative bivector
γ5BH

F = EH + cγ5BH, EH = (F · γ0)γ0 = (1/2)(F − γ0F γ0),

γ5BH = (1/c)(F ∧ γ0)γ0 = (1/2c)(F + γ0F γ0).

(2)

(The subscript ’H’ is for - Hestenes.) Both EH and BH are, in fact, bivectors.
Similarly in(9) F is decomposed in terms of observer dependent quantities, 1-
vector EJ and a bivector BJ (the subscript ’J’ is for - Jancewicz) as F = γ0 ∧
EJ − cBJ , where EJ = F · γ0 and BJ = −(1/c)(F ∧ γ0)γ0. The F ﬁeld can be
also decomposed in terms of another algebric objects; the observer dependent
electric and magnetic parts of F are represented with 1-vectors that are
denoted as Ef and Bf (see also(2) and(15)). The physical description with
1-vectors Ef and Bf is simpler but completely equivalent to the description
with the bivectors EH, BH, Refs. 7,8, or with 1-vector EJ and a bivector BJ ,
Ref. 9. Such decomposition of F is not only simpler but also much closer
to the classical representation of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds by the 3D
vectors E and B than those used in.(7−9) Thus

F = Ef ∧ γ0 + c(γ5Bf ) · γ0,
Ef = F · γ0, Bf = −(1/c)γ5(F ∧ γ0).

Having at our disposal diﬀerent decompositions of F into observer de-
pendent quantities we proceed to present the diﬀerence between the ST and
the LT of the ME using the decomposition (3) and only brieﬂy (2). We shall
not deal with the decomposition of F into EJ and BJ from(9) since both the
procedure and the results are completely the same as with (3) and (2).

2.1. The Field Equations in the γ0 - Frame. The Maxwell Equations

When (3) is introduced into the ﬁeld equation for F (1) we ﬁnd

∂[(F · γ0) ∧ γ0 + (F ∧ γ0) · γ0] = j/ε0c
∂(Ef ∧ γ0 + c(γ5Bf ) · γ0) = j/ε0c.

The equations (4) can be now written as coordinate-based geometric equa-
tions (CBGEs) in the standard basis {γµ} and the second equation becomes

{∂α[δαβ

µνEµ

f (γ0)ν + cεαβµν(γ0)µBf,ν] − (jβ/cε0)}γβ+

∂α[δαβ

µν(γ0)µcBν

f + εαβµν(γ0)µEf,ν]γ5γβ = 0,

(5)

(3)

(4)

5

where γ0 = (γ0)µγµ with (γ0)µ = (1, 0, 0, 0) and

Ef = Eµ
Bf = Bµ

f γµ = 0γ0 + F i0γi,
f γµ = 0γ0 + (−1/2c)ε0kliFklγi.

Thence the components of Ef and Bf in the {γµ} basis are

Ei

f = F i0, Bi

f = (−1/2c)ε0kliFkl.

(6)

(7)

The relation (7) is nothing else than the standard identiﬁcation of the com-
ponents F µν with the components of the 3D vectors E and B, see, e.g., Refs.
(It is worth noting that Einstein’s fundamental work(16) is the earli-
1,2.
est reference on covariant electrodynamics and on the identiﬁcation of some
components of F αβ with the components of the 3D E and B.) We see that in
the γ0 - frame Ef and Bf do not have the temporal components E0
f = 0.
Thus Ef and Bf actually refer to the 3D subspace orthogonal to the speciﬁc
timelike direction γ0. Notice that we can select a particular - but otherwise
arbitrary - inertial frame of reference as the γ0 - frame, to which we shall
refer as the frame of our ’ﬁducial’ observers (for this name see(17)). The sub-
script ′f ′ in the above relations stands for - ﬁducial - and denotes the explicit
dependence of these quantities on the γ0 -, i.e., ’ﬁducial’ - observer.

f = B0

Using that E0

f = B0

f = 0 and (γ0)µ = (1, 0, 0, 0) the equation (5) becomes

(∂kEk

f − j0/cε0)γ0 + (−∂0Ei

f + cεijk0∂jBf k − ji/cε0)γi+

(−c∂kBk

f )γ5γ0 + (c∂0Bi

f + εijk0∂jEf k)γ5γi = 0.

(8)

The ﬁrst part (with γα) in (8) is from the 1-vector part of (4), i.e., (5),
whereas the second one (with γ5γα) is from the trivector (pseudovector) part
of (4), i.e., (5). Both parts in (8) are written as CBGEs in the standard basis
{γµ} and cannot be further simpliﬁed as geometric equations. In the ﬁrst
part (with γα) in (8) one recognizes two Maxwell equations in the component
form, the Gauss law for the electric ﬁeld (the ﬁrst bracket, with γ0) and
the Amp`ere-Maxwell law (the second bracket, with γi). Similarly from the
second part (with γ5γα) in (8) we recognize the component form of another
two Maxwell equations, the Gauss law for the magnetic ﬁeld (with γ5γ0) and
Faraday’s law (with γ5γi).

The whole procedure can be repeated using the decomposition of F (2)
into the bivectors EH, BH as in Refs. 7,8. We shall quote only the results

6

(the complete derivation is given in Ref. 13). When the decomposition (2)
is substituted into (1) we ﬁnd

∂(EH + cγ5BH) = j/ε0c.

(9)

All quantities in (9) can be written as CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ} (see
also(2,13)). Thus EH = F i0γi ∧ γ0, BH = (1/2c)εkli0Fklγi ∧ γ0. Both bivectors
EH and BH are parallel to γ0, that is, it holds that EH ∧ γ0 = BH ∧ γ0 = 0.
When written in terms of components (e.g., (EH)µν = γν · (γµ · EH) = (γν ∧
γµ)·EH) one ﬁnds that EH = (EH )i0γi ∧γ0 = Eiγi∧γ0, BH = (BH )i0γi ∧γ0 =
Biγi ∧ γ0. Thus it holds that (EH)ij = (BH)ij = 0. Multiplying (9) by γ0
and using the above expressions for EH, BH we write the resulting equation
as a CBGE

(∂kEk − j0/cε0) + (∂0Ei − cεijk0∂jBk + ji/cε0)(γi ∧ γ0)+

(c∂kBk)γ5 + (c∂0Bi + εijk0∂jEk)γ5(γi ∧ γ0) = 0.

(10)

The equation (10) is exactly the same as the equations obtained in the geo-
metric algebra formalism, e.g., the equations (8.5) and (8.6a-8.6d) in(7) Space-
Time Algebra, but now written as a CBGE. (10) encodes all four ME in the
component form in the same way as it happens with the equation (8). It
is worth noting that this step, the multiplication of (9) by γ0, in order to
get the usual ME, is unnecessary in the formulation with 1-vectors Ef and
Bf . This shows that the approach with 1-vectors Ef and Bf is simpler than
the approach with bivectors EH and BH and also it is much closer to the
classical formulation of the electromagnetism with the 3D vectors E and B.

2.2. The Comparison of the usual Covariant Approach and

the Geometric Approach, I

Let us now examine the diﬀerence between the usual covariant approach,
e.g., Refs. 5,6, and the above geometric approach. The covariant approach
deals with the component form (implicitly taken in the standard basis {γµ})
of the ME with F αβ and its dual ∗F αβ

∂αF aβ = jβ/ε0c,

∂α

∗F αβ = 0,

(11)

where ∗F αβ = (1/2)εαβγδFγδ.
(Almost always in the usual covariant ap-
proaches to SR one considers only the components of the geometric quan-
tities taken in the {γµ} basis and thus not the whole tensor. However the

7

(12)

(13)

components are coordinate quantities and they do not contain the whole in-
formation about the physical quantity.) In order to get the component form
of the ME with the 3D E and B

∂kEk − j0/cε0 = 0, −∂0Ei + cεikj∂jBk − ji/cε0 = 0,

∂kBk = 0,

c∂0Bi + εikj∂jEk = 0

from (11) one simply makes the identiﬁcation of six independent components
of F µν with three components Ei and three components Bi

Ei = F i0, Bi = (1/2c)εiklFlk.

(The components of the 3D ﬁelds E and B are written with lowered (generic)
subscripts, since they are not the spatial components of the 4D quantities.
This refers to the third-rank antisymmetric ε tensor too. The super- and
subscripts are used only on the components of the 4D quantities.) Then the
3D E and B, as geometric quantities in the 3D space, are constructed from
these six independent components of F µν and the unit 3D vectors i, j, k, e.g.,
E =F 10i + F 20j + F 30k. The usual ME with the 3D E and B are obtained
from (12) and so constructed 3D E and B as

∇E(r, t) = ρ(r, t)/ε0, ∇ × E(r, t) = −∂B(r, t)/∂t
∇B(r, t) = 0, ∇ × B(r, t) = (1/ε0c2)j(r, t) + (1/c2)∂E(r, t)/∂t. (14)

Such usual procedure has a number of disadvantages. They are:
i) The covariant ME (11) are written in the component form and these com-
ponents are taken in the Einstein system of coordinates, whereas the ﬁeld
equation (1) is written with AQs, i.e., it is independent of the reference frame
and of the chosen system of coordinates in that frame. When (1) is written as
a CBGE in the γ0 - frame with the {γµ} basis and when only the components
are taken then (1) becomes (11).
ii) It is considered by the identiﬁcation (13) that Ei and Bi are the primary
quantities for the whole electromagnetism and that the components F αβ are
derived from and determined with Ei and Bi. But the components F αβ are
determined as the solutions of the ﬁeld equations (11) for the given sources
and, in principle, they are not in any obvious relation with Ei and Bi, which
are the solutions of (12).
It is shown in Ref. 10 that the whole electro-
magnetism can be formulated exclusively by the well-deﬁned geometric 4D
quantity - the Faraday bivector F, without even mentioning the 3D E and

8

B or the 4D electromagnetic potentials (which are gauge dependent). Thus
F is the primary quantity and not the 3D E and B, or the potentials.
iii) The simple identiﬁcation (13) of the components Ei and Bi with the
components of F αβ is not permissible tensor operation; permissible tensor
operations with components of tensors produce components of new tensors,
for example: a) multiplication by a scalar ﬁeld b) addition of components
of two tensors c) contraction on a pair of indices, ... .
iv) Such identiﬁcation of the components of the 3D E and B with com-
ponents of F µν is dependent on the chosen system of coordinates.
In the
usual covariant approaches the standard basis {γµ} is implicitly assumed.
However the identiﬁcation (13) is meaningless, e.g., in the ’r’ system of co-
ordinates, the {rµ} basis,(11) in which only the Einstein synchronization is
replaced by an asymmetric synchronization, the ”radio” synchronization.(11)
r = F 10+F 12+F 13, which means that by the relation (13) E1r = F 10
Then F 10
r
the component E1r in the {rµ} basis is expressed as the combination of Ei
and Bi components from the {γµ} basis, E1r = E1 − B3 + B2, see Ref. 11.
v) Ei and Bi in (12) are the components of vectors deﬁned on the 3D space
while F αβ are the components of tensor deﬁned on the 4D spacetime. Thence
when forming the geometric quantities the components of the 4D quantity
would need to be multiplied with the unit vectors γi from the 4D spacetime
and not with the unit vectors i, j, k from the 3D space.

On the other hand in the above geometric approach the mapping between
F and 1-vectors Ef , Bf , or bivectors EH, BH, given by the equations (3)
and (2) respectively, is performed by a correct mathematical procedure and
Instead of (12) that
all quantities are deﬁned on the same 4D spacetime.
contains the combination of quantities (components) from the 4D spacetime
(∂µ, jµ) and from the 3D space (Ei, Bi, εikj) we have the CBGEs (8) and
f , Bµ
(10) in the geometric approach, which contain only components Eµ
f
and (EH)µν, (BH)µν of the well-deﬁned 4D quantities Ef , Bf , and EH, BH.
Similarly instead of the usual ME (14) with geometric quantities from the 3D
space E and B we have the ME (4) and (9) with geometric quantities from
the 4D spacetime Ef , Bf , and EH, BH. However it has to be noted that
the decompositions (3) and (2) still have some disadvantages.
In (3) and
(2) the observer independent 4D quantity F is decomposed into the observer
dependent 4D quantities Ef , Bf , or EH, BH by using the space-time split in
the γ0 - frame. The space-time split in another γ′
0 - frame is not obtained
by the LT from that one in the γ0 - frame. This problem will be discussed
in the subsequent sections and in Secs. 2.6. and 3. we shall present the new

9

decompositions of F without using the space-time split.

2.3. The LT of the Maxwell Equations

Let us now apply the active LT upon (8), or (5). We write (8), or (5), in

the form

(15)

aαγα + bα(γ5γα) = 0.
The coeﬃcients aα and bα are clear from (8), or (5); they are the usual ME in
the component form. In the Cliﬀord algebra formalism, e.g., Refs. 7-9, the
LT are considered as active transformations; the components of, e.g., some
1-vector relative to a given inertial frame of reference (with the standard
basis {γµ}) are transformed into the components of a new 1-vector relative
to the same frame (the basis {γµ} is not changed). Furthermore the LT are
R = p′µγµ.
described with rotors R, R
To an observer in the {γµ} frame the vector p′ appears the same as the vector
γ′
frame. For boosts in the direction γ1
p appears to an observer in the
µ
the rotor R is given by the relation

R = 1, in the usual way as p → p′ = Rp

R = (1 + γ + γβγ0γ1)/(2(1 + γ))1/2,

β is the scalar velocity in units of c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2. Then the LT of (4) are
given as

R{∂[(F · γ0) ∧ γ0 + (F ∧ γ0) · γ0] − j/ε0c}

R = 0,

R{∂[Ef ∧ γ0 + c(γ5Bf ) · γ0] − j/ε0c}

R = 0,

(17)

where R is given by (16). (A coordinate-free form of the LT is also given in
the Cliﬀord algebra formalism in(15) and in the tensor formalism in,(11) see
also.(18) The form presented in(15) does not need to use rotors but, of course,
it can be expressed by rotors as well.) Then the LT of the usual ME (15) are

e

R{aαγα + bα(γ5γα)}

R = 0.

Performing the LT we ﬁnd the explicit expression for (18) as

e

γ0(γa0 − βγa1) + γ1(γa1 − βγa0) + γ2a2 + γ3a3+
γ5γ0(γb0 − βγb1) + γ5γ1(γb1 − βγb0) + γ5γ2b2 + γ5γ3b3 = 0.

(18)

(19)

10

It can be simply written as

a′αγα + b′α(γ5γα) = 0,

(20)

where, e.g., a′0 = γa0 − βγa1 and, as it is said, aα and bα are the usual ME in
the component form given in (8), or (5). This result (19), i.e., (20), is exactly
the usual result for the active LT of a 1-vector and of a pseudovector. It is
important to note that, e.g., the Gauss law for the electric ﬁeld a0 does not
transform by the LT again to the Gauss law but to a′0, which is a combination
of the Gauss law and a part of the Amp`ere-Maxwell law (a1).

The second equation in (17) can be expressed in terms of Lorentz trans-

formed derivatives and Lorentz transformed 1-vectors Ef and Bf as

∂′[E′

(22) and (23); there is no mixing of components. When (21) is written in an
expanded form as a CBGE in the standard basis {γµ} it takes the form of (20)

ﬁeld written in the component form. It is clear from (24) that the LT do not
transform the Gauss law into the ’primed’ Gauss law but into quite diﬀerent
law (24); a′0 contains the time component E′0
f = 0), and also the
new ”Gauss law” includes the derivatives of the magnetic ﬁeld. The same
situation happens with other Lorentz transformed terms, which explicitly
shows that the Lorentz transformed ME ((21) with (24)) are not of the same
form as the original ones (8). This is a fundamental result which reveals
that, contrary to the previous derivations, e.g., Refs. 4,16,5-9, and contrary
to the general opinion, the usual ME are not Lorentz covariant equations.
The physical consequences of this achievement will be very important and
they will be carefully examined.

Again as in Sec 2.1. we give only the results for the case when EH, BH
are used (all details are given in Ref. 13.) The relation (10) can be written
in the form a0 + ai(γi ∧ γ0) + b0γ5 + biγ5(γi ∧ γ0) = 0. The coeﬃcients a0, ai
and b0, bi are clear from (10); they are the usual ME in the component form.
As it is said the usual ME (10) are obtained multiplying (9) by γ0. The LT
of the resulting equation (after multiplication by γ0) are

R{γ0[∂(EH + cγ5BH) − j/ε0c]}

R = 0.

(25)

Then after applying the LT upon (10) we ﬁnd a0 + R[ai(γi ∧ γ0)]
R[biγ5(γi ∧ γ0)]

R = 0, where, e.g.,

R + b0γ5 +

R = a1(γ1 ∧ γ0) + γ[a2(γ2 ∧ γ0) + a3(γ3 ∧ γ0)] −βγ[a2(γ2 ∧

H ∧ γ0 = B′
not parallel to γ0, i.e., it does not hold that E′

thus there are (E′

H)ij 6= 0 and (B′
Bf , see (22) and (23), the components (EH)µν ((BH)µν) transform upon the
active LT again to the components (E′
H)µν); there is no mixing of
components. Thus by the active LT EH transforms to E′
H.
Actually, as we said, this is the way in which every bivector transforms upon
the active LT. Then (26) can be written as a CBGE in the standard basis
{γµ}, but for simplicity we only quote the scalar term a′0

Comparing a′0 (28) with a0 from the usual ME (10) a0 = ∂k(EH)k0 − j0/cε0,
we again see, as with Ef and Bf , that a′0 substantially diﬀers in form from
the term a0 in (10). The same situation happens with other transformed
terms, which shows that the Lorentz transformed ME, (26) with (28), are
not of the same form as the original ones (10). This is a fundamental result
which once again reveals that, contrary to the previous derivations, e.g., Refs.
4, 16, 5-9, and contrary to the generally accepted belief, the usual ME are
not Lorentz covariant equations.

2.4. The ST of the Maxwell equations

st and B′

In contrast to the correct active LT of Ef (22) and Bf (23) it is wrongly
assumed in the usual derivations of the the ST for E′
st (the subscript
- st - is for - standard) that the quantities obtained by the active LT of Ef
and Bf are again in the 3D subspace of the γ0 - observer, see also.(2) This
means that it is wrongly assumed in all usual derivations, e.g., in the Cliﬀord
algebra formalism(7−9) (and in the tensor formalism(16,5,6) as well), that one
can again perform the same identiﬁcation of the transformed components
F ′µν with the components of the 3D E′ and B′ as in (7). Thus it is taken(7−9)
that for the transformed E′

As can be seen from (29) and (30), i.e., from (31), the transformations for
E′i
st. are exactly the ST of components of the 3D vectors E and B
that are quoted in almost every textbook and paper on relativistic electrody-
namics. Notice that, in contrast to the active LT (22) and (23), according to
the ST (29), i.e., (31), the transformed components E′i
st are expressed by the
mixture of components Ei
f , and (30) shows that the same holds for
st. In all previous treatments of SR, e.g., Refs. 7-9 (and(4−6,16)) the trans-
B′i
formations for E′i
st. are considered to be the LT of the 3D electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. However the above analysis, and(1,2) as well, show that
the transformations for E′i
st. (31) are derived from the relativistically
incorrect transformations (29) and (30), which are not the LT; the LT are
given by the relations (22) and (23).

It is also argued in all previous works, starting in the year 1905 with
Einstein’s fundamental paper on SR,(4) that the usual ME with the 3D E
and B are Lorentz covariant equations. The relation (21) together with
(24) shows that it is not true; the Lorentz transformed ME are not of the
same form as the original ones. Here we explicitly show that in the usual
derivations the ME remain unchanged in form not upon the LT but upon
some transformations which, strictly speaking, have nothing to do with the
LT of the equation (4), i.e., of the ME (8). The diﬀerence between the
Lorentz transformed ME, given by (17) or ﬁnally by (21) with (24) (or by
(19)) and the equations (given below) obtained by applying the ST is the
same as it is the diﬀerence between the LT of Ef (Bf ) given by (22) ((23))
and their ST given by (29) ((30)). Thus the ST of the equation (4) are

(33)

The equation (33) is of the same form as the original ME (8) but the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds are not transformed by the LT than by the ST. Therefore,
as can be seen from (32) (together with (29) and (30)), the equation (33) is
not the LT of the original ME (8); the LT of the ME (8) are the equations (21)
with (24) (i.e., (19)) where the Lorentz transformed electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are given by the relations (22) and (23).

H,st and B′

Let us discuss the ST in the formulation with EH and BH. As can be
easily shown, see also,(2) the ST for E′
H,st are derived wrongly
assuming that the quantities obtained by the active LT of EH and BH are
again parallel to γ0, i.e., that again holds E′
H ∧ γ0 = B′
H ∧ γ0 = 0 and
consequently that (E′
H,st)ij = 0. Thence, in contrast to the correct
LT of EH ((27)) (and BH), it is taken in the usual derivations (Ref. 7, Space-
Time Algebra (eq. (18.22)), New Foundations for Classical Mechanics (Ch.
9 eqs. (3.51a,b)), Ref. 8 (Ch. 7.1.2 eq. (7.33))) that

R, and similarly for B′

H,st, see.(2) The relation (34) (and that
where F ′ = RF
one for B′
H,st) immediately gives the familiar expressions for the ST of the
3D vectors E and B. Now, in contrast to the correct LT of EH ((27)) (and
BH), the components of the transformed E′
H,st are expressed by the mixture
of components Ei and Bi, and the same holds for B′
H,st. The ST of (9) (after
multiplication by γ0) are given as

γ0[∂′(E′

H,st + cγ5B′

H,st) − j′/ε0c] = 0,

(35)

H,st is determined by (34) (and similarly for B′

where E′
H,st). Notice again that,
in contrast to the correct LT (25) or (26), γ0 is not transformed in (35), as it
is not transformed in the ST E′
H,st (34) (and B′
H,st). When (35) is written as
a CBGE in the standard basis {γµ} it becomes (∂′

0. This equation is of the same form as the original ME (10) but the bivectors
EH and BH representing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are not transformed
by the LT than by the ST. As seen from (35) this equation is not the LT of
the original ME (10); the LT of the ME (10) is the equation (26) with (28).

2.5. The Comparison of the usual Covariant Approach and

the Geometric Approach, II

In the usual covariant approach, e.g., Refs. 5,6, one transforms by the
passive LT the covariant ME (11) and ﬁnds ∂′
∗F ′αβ = 0.
(Upon the passive LT the set of components, e.g., jµ from the S frame
transform to j′µ in the relatively moving inertial frame of reference S′, j′µ =
Lµ
0 =
−βγ, L2
3 = 1 and all other components are zero.) Then the same
identiﬁcation as in (13) is assumed to hold for the transformed components
E′

νjν, where (for the boost in the γ1 direction) L0

αF ′aβ = j′β/ε0c, ∂′

i = F ′i0, B′

i = (1/2c)εiklF ′

(36)

e.g., F ′20 = γF 20 − βγF 21, which yields (by (13) and (36)) that E′
2 =
γE2 − βγcB3, see Jackson’s book(5) Sec. 11.10. Thus in the usual covariant
approach the components F aβ are transformed by the passive LT into F ′aβ
and then it is simply argued that six independent components of F ′aβ are
the ”Lorentz transformed” components E′
i. The identiﬁcation (36)
reveals an additional disadvantage in the usual covariant approach that is
not mentioned in Sec. 2.2.. It is
vi) It is not possible to speak about the LT of some components of F aβ as in
(36); the LT always transform the whole geometric 4D quantity and not some
components. Further, by the same procedure as in Sec. 2.2., one ﬁnds the
”transformed” equations of the same form as (12) and (14), but with primed
quantities replacing the unprimed ones, e.g., ∂′

k − j′0/cε0 = 0, and

i and B′

kE′

∇′E′(r′, t′) = ρ′(r′, t′)/ε0, ...,

(37)

where, e.g., the 3D vector E′ is again obtained multiplying the components
F ′i0 by the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′, E′=F ′10i′ + F ′20j′ + F ′30k′. However the
meaning of the 3D vectors i′, j′, k′ is undeﬁned; they are not obtained by
any transformation, particularly not by the LT from the 3D vectors i, j, k.
Obviously such procedure has the same disadvantages as those discussed in
Sec. 2.2 including the new one - vi). The components E′
i and the 3D ﬁelds

i, B′

16

are all ill-deﬁned in the 4D spacetime. On the other hand the meaning of all
quantities in the above geometric approach is very clear; they are all well-
deﬁned in the 4D spacetime. Moreover it is clearly seen the diﬀerence between
the LT and the ST of the 4D quantities representing the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds;
in the LT always the whole 4D geometric quantity is transformed
as, e.g., in (22) and (23), whereas in the ST only a part of the whole 4D
geometric quantity is transformed as, e.g., in (29) and (30). Nevertheless
the usual procedure, the identiﬁcations (13) and (36) and the derivation of
the ”transformed” equations (37) is considered for almost hundred years as
relativistically correct procedure. It is argued in every paper and textbook
on the relativistic electrodynamics (without exception as I am aware) that
the equations (14) are Lorentz covariant equations, i.e., that the LT of the
equations (14) are the equations (37). Our discussion explicitly shows that in
the 4D spacetime the usual procedure is not justiﬁed either mathematically
or physically.

2.6. Lorentz Invariant Field Equations with 1-Vectors E, B

and Bivectors EHv, BHv

Let us now remove the disadvantage mentioned at the end of Sec. 2.2.
that still exists in all Cliﬀord algebra approaches to the electromagnetism.
Instead of to decompose F into the observer dependent Ef and Bf in the γ0
- frame, as in (3), we present the decomposition of F into the AQs, 1-vectors
of the electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds that are deﬁned without reference
frames, see also.(15) We deﬁne

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v,
E = (1/c)F · v,

IB = (1/c2)F ∧ v, B = −(1/c2)I(F ∧ v),

(38)

where I is the unit pseudoscalar. (I is deﬁned algebrically without introduc-
ing any reference frame, as in(19) Sec. 1.2.) It holds that E · v = B · v = 0
(since F is skew-symmetric). v in (38) can be interpreted as the velocity
(1-vector) of a family of observers who measures E and B ﬁelds. The veloc-
ity v and all other quantities entering into (38) are deﬁned without reference
frames. v characterizes some general observer. Thus the relations (38) hold
for any observer. However it has to be emphasized that (38) is not a phys-
ical deﬁnition of E and B; the physical deﬁnition has to be given in terms
of the Lorentz force and Newton’s second law as, e.g., in.(15) The relations

17

(38) actually establish the equivalence of the formulation of electrodynamics
with the ﬁeld bivector F, see,(10) and the formulation with 1-vectors of the
electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds. Both formulations, with F and E, B ﬁelds,
are equivalent formulations, but every of them is a complete, consistent and
self-contained formulation. When (38) is inserted into the ﬁeld equation for
F (1) then (1) becomes the ﬁeld equation for E, B ﬁelds

∂[E ∧ (v/c) + (IB) · v] = j/ε0c.

(39)

In contrast to the ﬁeld equation (4), that holds only for the γ0-observer, the
ﬁeld equation (39) holds for any observer; the quantities entering into (39)
are all AQs. The equation (39) is physicaly completely equivalent to the ﬁeld
equation for F (1). In some basis {eµ} the ﬁeld equation (39) can be written
as a CBGE

[∂α(δαβ

µνEµvν + εαβµνvµcBν)−(jβ/ε0)]eβ+

∂α(δαβ

µνvµcBν + εαβµνvµEν)e5eβ = 0,

(40)

µδβ

ν − δα

µν = δα

where Eα and Bα are the basis components of the electric and magnetic 1-
νδβ
vectors E and B, δαβ
µ and e5 is the pseudoscalar for the
frame {eµ}. The ﬁrst part in (40) (it contains sources) emerges from ∂ · F =
j/ε0c and the second one (the source-free part) is obtained from ∂ ∧ F = 0,
see also.(15) Instead of to work with the observer independent ﬁeld equation
in the F - formulation (1) one can equivalently use the E, B - formulation
with the ﬁeld equation (39), or in the {eµ} basis (40). (The complete E, B
- formulation of the relativistic electrodynamics will be reported elsewhere.)
Furthermore one can completely forget the manner in which the equation
with E and B is obtained, i.e., the ﬁeld equation with F (1), and consider
the equation with E and B (39), which is deﬁned without reference frames, or
the corresponding CBGE (40), as the primary and fundamental equations for
the whole classical electromagnetism. In such correct relativistic formulation
of the electromagnetism the ﬁeld equation with 1- vectors E and B (39) takes
over the role of the usual ME with the 3D E and B, i.e., of the ME (8). We
note that the equivalent formulation of electrodynamics with tensors Ea and
Ba is reported in,(11,20) whereas the component form in the Einstein system
of coordinates is given in Refs. 17,21 and Ref. 22.

Let us now take that in (40) the standard basis {γµ} is used instead of
some general basis {eµ} . Then (40) can be written as C βγβ + Dβγ5γβ = 0,
µνvµcBν +
where C β = ∂α(δαβ

νµvµEν − εαβνµvµcBν) − jβ/ε0 and Dβ = ∂α(δαβ

18

εαβµνvµEν). When the active LT are applied upon such (40) with the {γµ}
basis the equation remains of the same form but with primed quantities re-
placing the unprimed ones (of course the basis is unchanged). This can be
immediately seen since the equation (40) is written in a manifestly covariant
form. Thus the Lorentz transformed (40) is

R(C βγβ + Dβγ5γβ)

R = 0,
C ′βγβ + D′βγ5γβ = 0,

e

(41)

where, e.g., C ′β = ∂′
ν) − j′β/ε0. Obviously such
formulation of the electromagnetism with fundamental equation (39) or (40)
is a relativistically correct formulation.

νµv′µE′ν − εαβνµv′

α(δαβ

µcB′

f = B0

What is the relation between the relativistically correct ﬁeld equation
(39) or (40) and the usual ME (8). From the above discussion and from
section 2.1. one concludes that if in (39) we specify the velocity v of the
observers who measure E and B ﬁelds to be v = cγ0, then the equation (39)
becomes the equation (4). Further choosing the standard basis {γµ} in the
γ0 - frame, in which v = cγ0, or in the components vα = (c, 0, 0, 0), then
in that γ0 - frame E and B become Ef and Bf and they do not have the
temporal components E0
f = 0. The CBGE (40) becomes the usual ME
(8). Thus the usual Cliﬀord algebra treatments of the electromagnetism(7−9)
with the space-time split in the γ0 - frame and the usual ME (8) are simply
obtained from our observer independent formulation with ﬁeld equation (39)
or (40) choosing that v = cγ0 and choosing the standard basis {γµ}. We see
that the correspondence principle is simply satisﬁed in this formulation with
E and B ﬁelds; all results obtained in the previous treatments from the usual
ME with the 3D E and B remain valid in the formulation with the 1-vectors
E and B if physical phenomena are considered only in one inertial frame of
reference. Namely the selected inertial frame of reference can be chosen to
be the γ0 - frame with the {γµ} basis. Then there, as explained above, the
CBGE (40) can be reduced to the equations containing only the components,
the four ME in the component form, the ME (8). Thus for observers who are
at rest in the γ0 - frame (v = cγ0) the components of the 3D E and B can
be simply replaced by the space components of the 1-vectors E and B in the
{γµ} basis. We remark that just such observers are usually considered in the
conventional formulation with the 3D E and B. The dependence of the ﬁeld
equations (40) on v reﬂects the arbitrariness in the selection of the γ0 - frame
but at the same time it makes the equations (40) independent of that choice.

19

The γ0 - frame can be selected at our disposal, which proves that we don’t
have a kind of the ”preferred” frame theory. All experimental results that are
obtained in one inertial frame of reference can be equally well explained by
our geometric formulation of the electromagnetism with the 1-vectors E and
B as they are explained by the usual ME with the 3D E and B.

R = E′

R, ∂′ = R∂

R, E′ = REf

f , B′ = RBf

However there is a fundamental diﬀerence between the standard approach
with the 3D E and B and the approach with the 4D AQs E and B. It is
considered in all standard treatments that the equation (33) is the LT of
the original ME (8). But, as shown here, the equation (33) is not the LT of
the original ME (8); the LT of the ME (8) are the equations (19) (i.e., (20)
with (24), or (21)). The ME (8) are obtained from our ﬁeld equation (40) by
putting that v = cγ0 and choosing the standard basis {γµ}. In the same way
the equations (41), which are the LT of the equations (40), become the LT
of the ME (8), that is, the equations (19) (or (20) with (24), or (21)), when
in (41) it is taken that v′, ∂′, E′ and B′ are the LT of v = cγ0, ∂, Ef and
Bf , that is, v′ = R(cγ0)
R = B′
f .
We recall from Sec. 2.3. that to an observer in the {γµ} frame the vector p′
R = p′µγµ) appears the same as the vector p (p = pµγµ) appears to
(p′ = Rp
an observer in the
frame. This, together with the preceding discussion,
e
show that the usual ME with the 3D E and B, i.e., the equation (8) and the
equation (33) obtained by the ST from (8), cannot be used for the explanation
of any experiment that test SR, i.e., in which relatively moving observers have
to compare their data obtained by measurements on the same physical object.
In contrast to the description of the electromagnetism with the 3D E and B,
the description with the 4D ﬁelds E and B, i.e., with the equations (40) and
(41), is correct not only in the γ0 - frame with the standard basis {γµ} but
in all other relatively moving frames and it holds for any permissible choice
of coordinates, i.e., basis {eµ}. We see that the relativistically correct ﬁelds
E and B and the new ﬁeld equations (39) and (40) do not have the same
physical interpretation as the usual 3D ﬁelds E and B and the usual 3D ME
(8) except in the γ0 - frame with the {γµ} basis in which E0 = B0 = 0. This
consideration completely deﬁnes the relation between our approach with 4D
E and B and all previous approaches.

As explained in the preceding sections the observer independent F ﬁeld is
decomposed in (2), see,(7,8) in terms of observer dependent quantities, i.e., as
the sum of a relative vector EH and a relative bivector γ5BH, by making the
space-time split in the γ0 - frame. But, here we present the new decomposi-

20

tion of F into the AQs, the bivectors EHv and BHv, which are independent
of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it.
We deﬁne

F = EHv + cIBHv, EHv = (1/c2)(F · v) ∧ v

BHv = −(1/c3)I[(F ∧ v) · v],

IBHv = (1/c3)(F ∧ v) · v

(42)

(The subscript ’Hv’ is for - Hestenes with v and not, as usual,(7,8) with γ0.)
Obviously (42) holds for any observer. When (42) is used the ﬁeld equation
for F (1), after multiplication by v/c (instead of by γ0), becomes

(v/c){∂(EHv + cIBHv) − j/ε0c} = 0.

(43)

In contrast to the ﬁeld equation (9) that holds only for the γ0-observer, the
ﬁeld equation (43) holds for any observer; the quantities entering into (43)
are the AQs. The equation (43) is physicaly completely equivalent to the ﬁeld
equation for F (1), i.e., to the ﬁeld equation with 1- vectors E and B (39).
(The equation (9) corresponds to the equation (4), whereas (43) corresponds
to (39).) The ﬁeld equation (43) can be written as a CBGE, and it looks
much more complicated than the equation (40) with 1- vectors E and B. We
write it (for better comparison) as two equations; the ﬁrst one will yield the
scalar and bivector parts of (10) when v/c = γ0. It is

(1/c)vβ∂α(EHv)αβ + [(1/2c)vα∂α(EHv)βσ − (1/2)εµνασvβ∂α(BHv)µν]γβ ∧ γσ
= (1/ε0c2)(vαjα + vβjσγβ ∧ γσ).
(44)

The second equation will yield the pseudoscalar and pseudobivector parts of
(10) when v/c = γ0 and it is

vβ∂α(BHv)αβγ5+(1/2)vα∂α(BHv)µνγ5(γµ∧γν)+(vβ∂α−vα∂β)(EHv)ανγβ∧γν = 0.

(45)
In the {γµ} basis I = γ5. The equation (44) is with sources and it emerges
from ∂ · F = j/ε0c, while (45) is the source-free equation and it emerges
from ∂ ∧ F = 0. Comparing (44) and (45) in the EHv, BHv - formulation
with the corresponding parts in (40) with 1- vectors E and B we see that
the formulation with E and B is much simpler and more elegant than the
formulation with bivectors EHv and BHv; the physical content is completely
equivalent.

The equations (44) and (45) are written in a manifestly covariant form.
This means that when the active LT are applied upon such (44) and (45) the

21

equations remain of the same form but with primed quantities replacing the
unprimed ones (of course the basis is unchanged).

The whole discussion with 1- vectors E and B about the correspondence
principle applies in the same measure to the formulation with bivectors EHv
and BHv. The only diﬀerence is the simplicity of the formulation with 1-
vectors E and B.

The same conclusions hold for the formulation with 1-vector EJ and a
bivector BJ from,(9) but for the sake of brevity that formulation will not be
considered here.

3. THE PROOF OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ST

AND THE LT OF THE ME USING THE TENSOR
FORMALISM WITH 4-VECTORS Ea AND Ba

The same proof and the whole consideration as with 1-vectors E and B
can be given in the tensor formalism as well (it is presented in detail in Ref.
13). The important parts of this issue are already treated in.(11,15,1) Therefore
we only quote the main results. Now we start with Lorentz invariant ﬁeld
equations with v and with the decomposition of F ab into the AQs Ea and
Ba since in the tensor formalism such ﬁeld equations and the decomposition
are already in use.(23,24)

The electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F ab is deﬁned as an AQ; it is an abstract
tensor. Latin indices a,b,c, ... are to be read according to the abstract index
notation, as in(23,24) and(11,12,20). As already said in the invariant SR that
uses 4D AQs in the tensor formalism,(11,12,20,1) and in the Cliﬀord algebra
formalism,(10,15,2) any permissible system of coordinates, not necessary the
Einstein system of coordinates, i.e., the standard basis {γµ}, can be used
on an equal footing. However, for simplicity, we shall only deal with the
standard basis {γµ}. In the tensor formalism γµ denote the basis 4-vectors
forming the standard basis {γµ}.

In the abstract index notation the ﬁeld equations with F ab are given as

(−g)−1/2∂a((−g)1/2F ab) = jb/ε0c,

εabcd∂bFcd = 0,

(46)

where g is the determinant of the metric tensor gab and ∂a is an ordinary
derivative operator. Now there are two ﬁeld equations whereas in the geo-
metric algebra formalism they are united in only one ﬁeld equation. When
written in the {γµ} basis as CBGEs the relations (46) become

∂αF aβγβ = (1/ε0c)jβγβ,

∂α

∗F αβγβ = 0.

(47)

22

Instead of (38) from Sec. 2.6. we have the decomposition of F ab into the
AQs, the 4-vectors Ea and Ba

F ab = (1/c)δab
Ea = (1/c)F abvb, Ba = (1/2c2)εabcdvbFcd.

cdEcvd + εabcdvcBd,

Inserting (48) into (46) we ﬁnd the Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations with Ea
and Ba that correspond to (39) from Sec. 2.6. When these equations are
written as CBGEs in the {γµ} basis they become

∂α(δαβ
∂α(δαβ

µνEµvν + εαβµνvµcBν)γβ = (jβ/ε0)γβ
µνvµcBν + εαβµνvµEν)γβ = 0.

(48)

(49)

The equations (49) correspond to (40) from Sec. 2.6. (when written in the
standard basis {γµ}). It is clear from the form of the equations (49) (with
some general vµ) that they are invariant upon the passive LT . Namely in
a relatively moving frame S′ all quantities in (49) will be replaced with the
primed quantities that are obtained by the passive LT (of course, δαβ
µν and
εαβµν are unchanged). All the primed quantities (components and the basis)
are obtained from the corresponding unprimed quantities through the LT. The
components of any 4D CBGQ transform by the LT, while the basis vectors
γµ transform by the inverse LT, thus leaving the whole 4D CBGQ invariant
upon the passive LT. The invariance of some 4D CBGQ upon the passive LT
reﬂects the fact that such 4D quantity represents the same physical object for
relatively moving observers. Due to the invariance of every CBGQ upon the
passive LT the ﬁeld equations with primed quantities, thus in S′, are exactly
equal to the corresponding equations in S, given by (49). Thus the equations
(49) are not only covariant but also the Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations.
The principle of relativity is automatically included in such formulation.

The usual ME are simply obtained from (49) specifying that vα = c(γ0)α,
i.e., choosing the rest frame of ’ﬁducial’ observers, the γ0 - frame with the
{γµ} basis. Then from (49) we ﬁrst ﬁnd the ME exactly corresponding to
(5) from Sec. 2.1. and further the component form of the usual ME corre-
sponding to (8) (but now there are two equations)

f = (1/c)(F ∗)µν(γ0)ν. The equations
(50) (and (49) as well) can be written as aαγα = 0 and bαγα = 0. The
coeﬃcients aα and bα are clear from the ﬁrst and second equation respectively
in (50); they are the usual ME in the component form.

every well-deﬁned 4-vector (the components) transforms upon the LT. The
relations (51) are given in Ref. 1 and they correspond to relations (22) and
(23) from Sec. 2.3.. The AQ, e.g., an abstract tensor Ea, can be represented
by CBGQs in S and S′ as Eµ
µ and, of course, it must hold that,
e.g., Ea = Eµ

µ. Then the equations (50) transform to

and b′αγ′
while the basis 4-vectors transform by the inverse LT, e.g., γ′
0 = γγ0 + βγγ1.
Of course (γ0)ν transforms to v′ν/c and E′µ
f are given by (51). When the
coeﬃcients a′α and b′α are written in terms of the primed quantities (from
the S′ frame) then we ﬁnd the same expressions as in Sec. 2.3., e.g., the

The temporal components of E′µ

temporal components of Eµ

transformations (53) are not the LT of some well-deﬁned 4D quantities; the
LT cannot transform the unit 4-vector in the time direction in one frame S
to the unit 4-vector in the time direction in another relatively moving frame
S′. Obviously E′µ

are not the same quantity for observers in S and S′. As far as relativity is
concerned the quantities, e.g., Eµ

µ, are not related to one an-
other. The observers in S and S′ are not looking at the same physical object
but at two diﬀerent objects; every observer makes measurement on its own
object and such measurements are not related by the LT. From the relativis-
tically incorrect transformations (53) one simply derives the transformations
of the spatial components E′i
st., the relations (31) from Sec. 2.4.,
which are exactly the ST of components of the 3D E and B. According to
the ST the transformed components E′i
st, are expressed by the mixture
of components Ei
f . This completely diﬀers from the correct LT (51).
The transformations (53) and the transformations for E′i
st. (31) are
typical examples of the ”apparent” transformations that are ﬁrst discussed
in Refs. 25 and 26. The ”apparent” transformations of the spatial distances

(the Lorentz contraction) and the temporal distances (the dilatation of time)
are elaborated in detail in,(11,12) see also.(22) It is explicitly shown in(12) that
the true agreement with experiments that test SR exists when the theory
deals with well-deﬁned 4D quantities, i.e., the quantities that are invariant
upon the passive LT. However new experiments that test SR are continuosly
published in leading physical journals, e.g., Ref. 27, and in these papers the
dilatation of time and the Lorentz contraction are still considered as fun-
damental relativistic eﬀects. (These experiments will be discussed in detail
elsewhere.)

Let us now perform the ST of the ME (50) supposing that Eµ

are the equations (52) with a′0 as in (24), where the Lorentz transformed E′µ

4. SHORT COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS.

FARADAY DISK

Let us now brieﬂy discuss, as an example, the Faraday disk, using both the
conventional formulation of the electromagnetism with the 3D E and B and
their ST and this new formulation, the invariant relativistic electrodynamics,
with geometric 4D quantities. The comparison will be made in the tensor
formalism from Sec. 3.
since it is better known for physicists than the
geometric algebra formalism. A conducting disk is turning about thin axle
passing through the center at a right angle to the disk and parallel to a
uniform magnetic ﬁeld B. The circuit is made by connecting one end of
the resistor to the axle (the spatial point A) and the other end to a sliding
contact touching the external circumference (the spatial point C). The disk
of radius R is rotating with angular velocity ω. (For the description and
the picture of the Faraday disk see, e.g., Ref. 28 Chap. 18 or the recent
paper.(29)) Let us determine the electromotive force (emf) in two inertial

26

frames of reference, the laboratory frame S in which the disk is rotating
and the frame S′ instantaneously co-moving with a point on the external
circumference (say C, taken at some moment t, e.g., t = 0). The x′ axis is
along the 3-velocity V of the point C at t and it is parallel to the x axis.
Actually all axes in S′ are parallel to the corresponding axes in S. The y′
axis is along the radius, i.e., along the segment AC.

First we calculate the emf using the standard formulation. In the S frame

(55)

emf =

(FL/q) · dl =

(FL,y/q)dy=ωR2B/2,

I

ZAC
where FL is the usual form for the 3D Lorentz force FL = qE+qu × B, E =0
in S, B is along the +z axis, qu × B is the magnetic part of the Lorentz
force seen by the charges co-moving with the disk along the segment AC.
The integral along the segment AC is taken at the same moment t.
In
the S′ frame the usual treatments suppose that the Lorentz force becomes
F′
st are
determined by the ST (53). Thus it is argued in the conventional formulation
st = γV βV ×cB and B′
that in S′ the charges experiences the ﬁelds E′
st = γV B,
where βV = (V /c)i and γV = (1 − β2
V )−1/2. Then only the y′ component of
the force F′

st, where the components of the 3D E′

st and B′

L = qE′

L remains and it is

F ′

L,y = −qcBβu/γV (1 − βuβV ).

(56)

st+qu′ × B′

Notice that the same relation can be obtained from the deﬁnition of the 4-
uF ′2 =
force (the components) K µ = (γuF · u, γuF) and its LT. This gives γ′
γuF 2 whence the same F ′
L,y is obtained. (This happens here accidentally since
F ′
L,y is calculated along the y axis and E =0 in S. Generally the expression
F′
L = qE′
st and the expression obtained from the LT of the 4-force
will not give the same result.) In S′ the velocity (in units of c) β′
u of some
point on the segment AC is β′
u = (βu −βV )/(1−βuβV ) and the corresponding
γ′
u = γV γu(1 − βuβV ). The emf is again given by the integral of F ′
u is γ′
L,y/q
over the common y, y′ axis (along the segment AC, dl′= dl) taken again at
the same moment of time, t′ = 0 (y axis is orthogonal to the relative velocity
V)

emf ′ =

(F ′

L,y/q)dy.

ZAC

(57)

It is clear from the expression for the emf in S (55) and the correspond-
ing one for the emf in S′ (57) together with (56) that these electromotive

27

forces, in general, are not equal, emf ′ 6= emf. Only in the limit βu, βV ≪ 1
emf ′ ≃ emf . This result explicitly shows that the standard formulation is
not relativistically correct formulation.

Let us now consider the same example in the invariant relativistic elec-
trodynamics. In the tensor formalism the invariant Lorentz force K a is in-
vestigated in(11) Sec. 6.1. In terms of F ab it is K a = (q/c)F abub, where ub
is the 4-velocity of a charge q. In the general case of an arbitrary spacetime
and when ua is diﬀerent from va (the 4-velocity of an observer who measures
Ea and Ba), i.e. when the charge and the observer have distinct world lines,
K a can be written in terms of Ea and Ba as a sum of the va - orthogonal
component, K a

⊥, and va - parallel component, K a

k , K a = K a

Speaking in terms of the prerelativistic notions one can say that K a
⊥ (58) plays
the role of the usual Lorentz force lying on the 3D hypersurface orthogonal
to va, while K a
k (59) is related to the work done by the ﬁeld on the charge.
However in the invariant SR only both components together, that is, K a, does
have deﬁnite physical meaning and K a deﬁnes the Lorentz force both in the
theory and in experiments. Of course K a, K a
k are all 4D quantities
deﬁned without reference frames, the AQs, and the decomposition of K a is
an observer independent decomposition. Then we deﬁne the emf also as an
invariant 4D quantity, the Lorentz scalar,

⊥ and K a

emf =

(K a/q)dla,

ZΓ

(60)

where dla is the inﬁnitesimal spacetime length and Γ is the spacetime curve.
Let the observers are at rest in the S frame, vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0) whence E0 =
B0 = 0; the S frame is the rest frame of ’ﬁducial’ observers, the γ0 - frame
with the {γµ} basis. Thus the components of the 4-vectors in the {γµ}
basis are Eµ = (0, 0, 0, 0), Bµ = (0, 0, 0, B), uµ = (c, u = ωρ, 0, 0), dlµ =
(0, 0, dl2 = dy, 0). Thence K a
⊥ = quB. When
all quantities in (60) are written as CBGQs in the S frame with the {γµ}

k = 0, K 0

⊥ = 0, K 2

⊥ = K 1

⊥ = K 3

28

basis we ﬁnd emf = ωR2B/2. Since the expression (60) is independent of
the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it we
shall get the same result in the relatively moving S′ frame as well;

emf =

ZΓ(in S)

(K µ/q)dlµ =

ZΓ(in S′)

(K ′µ/q)dl′

µ = ωR2B/2.

(61)

This can be checked directly performing the LT of all 4-vectors as CBGQs
from S to S′ including the transformation of vµγµ. Obviously the approach
with Lorentz invariant 4D quantities gives the relativistically correct answer
in an enough simple and transparent way.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The covariance of the ME is cosidered to be one of the cornerstone of the
modern relativistic ﬁeld theories, both classical and quantum. Einstein(4)
derived the ST of the 3D E and B assuming that the ME with E and B
must have the same form in all relatively moving inertial frames of reference.
In Einstein’s formulation of SR(4) the principle of relativity is a fundamen-
tal postulate that is supposed to hold for all physical laws including those
expressed by 3D quantities, e.g., the ME with the 3D E and B. This deriva-
tion is discussed in detail in Ref. 11. The results presented in this paper
substantially change generally accepted opinion about the covariance of the
ME exactly proving in the geometric algebra and tensor formalisms that the
usual ME ((8), or (10), or (50)) change their form upon the LT (see (21) with
(24), or (26) with (28), or (52) with a′0 from (24)). It is also proved that the
ST of the ME (see (32) and (33), or (35), or (54)), which leave unchanged the
form of the ME, actually have nothing in common with the LT of the usual
ME. The diﬀerence between the LT of the ME, e.g., (21) with (24), and their
ST, e.g., (32) and (33), is essentially the same as it is the diﬀerence between
the LT of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (see (22) and (23), or (27), or (51))
and their ST (see (29) and (30), or (34), or (53)). This last diﬀerence is
proved in detail in(1,2) and that proof is only brieﬂy repeated in this paper.
All this together reveals that, contrary to the generally accepted opinion, the
principle of relativity does not hold for physical laws expressed by 3D quanti-
ties (a fundamental achievement). A 3D quantity cannot correctly transform
upon the LT and thus it does not have an independent physical reality in the
4D spacetime; it is not the same quantity for relatively moving observers in

29

in Ref. 11, and Ref. 12).
the 4D spacetime (see also, e.g., Figs. 3. and 4.
Since the usual ME change their form upon the LT they cannot describe in a
relativistically correct manner the experiments that test SR, i.e., the exper-
iments in which relatively moving observers measure the same 4D physical
quantity. Therefore the new ﬁeld equations with geometric 4D quantities are
constructed in geometric algebra formalism with 1-vectors E and B ((39) and
(40)), and with bivectors EHv and BHv ((43) and (44) with (45)), and also in
the tensor formalism with 4-vectors Ea and Ba ((49)); the Lorentz invariant
ﬁeld equations in the tensor formalism are already presented in Refs. 11, 20.
All quantities in these geometric equations are independent of the chosen ref-
erence frame and of the chosen coordinate system in it. When the γ0 - frame
with the {γµ} basis is chosen, in which the observers who measure the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds are at rest, then all mentioned geometric equations
become the usual ME. This result explicitly shows that the correspondence
principle is naturally satisﬁed in the invariant SR. However, as seen here, the
description with 4D geometric quantities is correct not only in the γ0 - frame
with the {γµ} basis but in all other relatively moving frames and it holds for
any permissible choice of coordinates. We conclude from the results of this
paper that geometric 4D quantities, deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., the
AQs, or as CBGQs, do have an independent physical reality and the relativis-
tically correct physical laws are expressed in terms of such quantities. The
principle of relativity is automatically satisﬁed with such quantities whereas
in the standard formulation of SR it is postulated outside the mathematical
formulation of the theory. We see that the role of the principle of relativity is
substantially diﬀerent in the Einstein formulation of SR and in the invariant
SR. The results of this paper clearly support the latter one. Furthermore we
note that all observer independent quantities, i.e., the AQs, introduced here
and the ﬁeld equations written in terms of them hold in the same form both
in the ﬂat and curved spacetimes. The results obtained in this paper will
have important and numerous consequences in all relativistic ﬁeld theories,
classical and quantum. Some of them will be soon examined.

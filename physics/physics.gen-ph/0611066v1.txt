Possible Zero-Flux Transport induced by
Density Waves in a Tube ﬁlled with Solid Helium

Abstract

Macroscopic derivation of the entrainment in a supersolid cylinder induced by a surface
elastic wave (of small amplitude) propagating along the ﬂexible interface is conducted by
considering the nonlinear coupling between the interface and the rarefaction eﬀect. We ob-
tain the critical bounds for zero-volume-ﬂow-rate states corresponding to speciﬁc rarefaction
measure and wave number which is relevant to the rather small critical velocity or disap-
pearance of supersolid ﬂows reported by Rittner and Reppy.

Introduction

In 1969, it was conjectured by Andreev and Lifshitz1 that at zero temperature, delocalized de-

fects may exist in a quantum solid, as a result of which the number of sites of an ideal crystal

lattice may not coincide with the total number of particles. Originally, this conjecture was pro-
posed for three dimensional quantum solids made of atoms (3He, 4He, · · ·) which do not interact

via Coulomb repulsion. The proposed supersolid phase is believed to occur due to the quan-
tum behavior of point defects, namely vacancies and interstitials, in this crystal of bosons2−3.

Researchers have found that a small lattice model does not exhibit the mesoscopic signature of

an intermediate phase separating the solid from the liquid, where the solid and the ﬂuid would
coexist4. Such a vacancy-solid phase was indeed suggested1 by Andreev and Lifshitz if the zero

point motions of certain defects become suﬃcient to form waves propagating inside the solid.
Castaing and Nozi`eres have later considered5 such a possibility for spin polarized 3He. The

statistics of the defects depend on their nature. For simple vacancies in the crystal, their statis-

tics is given by the statistics of the particles out of which the solid is made. If the defects are

bosons, they may form a condensate, giving rise to a superﬂuid coexisting with the solid. This
supersolid phase is discussed in certain bosonic models6. If the defects are fermions, they may
form a Fermi liquid7 coexisting with the solid, such that the system is neither a solid, nor a

liquid. Two kinds of motion are possible in it; one possesses the properties of motion in an

elastic solid, the second possesses the properties of motion in a liquid. This interesting issue

motivates our present study.
Early theoretical work by Andreev and Lifshitz1 and Chester2 showed that solids may feature

1

2

a Bose-Einstein condensate of vacancies (or interstitial atoms) and thus possess superﬂuid (SF)

properties. Quite recently one description of the quantum solid is as a density wave that has
formed in the quantum ﬂuid8−9. The periodicity of this density wave need not match precisely

to the particle density, so that the ground state may be incommensurate, with unequal densi-

ties of vacancies and interstitials. Whether or not the same is true for quantum ﬂuctuations

is not clear at this point. We noticed that previous theories imply a corresponding vacancy
contribution to the speciﬁc heat that is as large as the phonon contribution near 1 Kelvin3,10.

Based on these considerations or phenomenological approaches, assuming the existance of small-

amplitude density waves along the deformable boundaries, in this letter, we shall demonstrate

that wavy ﬂexible interface (between atoms and free vacancies or defects) or highly-pressured
environments8 can produce elastically deformed interface or peristaltic motion will induce time-
averaged transport in a Andreev-Lifshitz supersolid1,2.

Theoretical studies of interphase nonlocal transport phenomena which appear as a result of a

diﬀerent type of nonequilibrium representing propagation of a surface elastic wave have been
performed before11−12. These are relevant to particles ﬂowing along deformable elastic slabs with

the dominated parameter being the Knudsen number (Kn = mean-free-path/Ld, mean-free-path
(mfp) is the mean free path (of the particles) which is thus temperature dependent13,14, Ld is pro-
portional to the characteristic distance between two boundaryies)13−15. The role of the Knudsen
number is similar to that of the Navier slip15 parameter Ns(= µS/Ld; S is a proportionality

constant as us = Sτ , τ : the shear stress of the bulk velocity; us : the dimensional slip velocity;

for a no-slip case, S = 0, but for a no-stress condition. S = ∞, µ is the viscosity).

We shall choose a periodic domain to simplify our mathematical treatments. The deformable

(elastic) interface is presumed. We adopt the macroscopic or hydrodynamical approach and

simplify the original system of equations (related to the momentum and mass transport) to

one single higher-order quasi-linear partial diﬀerential equation in terms of the unknown stream

function. In this study, as the temperature is rather low and the phase is related to the super-

solid (there might be weakly friction or shearing dissipation in-between) we shall assume that

the governing equations are the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations which will be associated
with the microscopically slip velocity boundary conditions along the interfaces13−15 (cf. Ref.

13 for the quantum slip case). To consider the originally quiescent environment for simplicity,

due to the diﬃculty in solving a fourth-order quasi-linear complex ordinary diﬀerential equation

(when the wavy boundary condition are imposed), we can ﬁnally get an analytically perturbed

solution and calculate those physical quantities, like, time-averaged transport or entrainment,

critical forcing corresponding to the freezed or zero-volume-ﬂow-rate states. The latter might
be relevant to those reported in Refs. [16-18] for very low ﬂow rates16 or disappearance of su-
persolidity through an annealing of the solid helium sample17. Note that, as also reported in
Ref. 18, their results suggested that grain boundaries (GBs) are superﬂuid, so that 4He crystals

3

of medium quality are supersolid at the liquid/solid equilibrium pressure (Pm); that is, mass

transport through them without dissipation is possible.

2 Formulations

To escape from the diﬃculties in treating many-body or many-particle problems together with

the scattering with a elastic boundary, we adopt the hydrodynamical approach but use the
microscopic quantum slip boundary condition which takes into account the mean free path13 of
the dilute molecular gas corresponding to the nonzero slip velocity13 along the interface-wall.

We consider a circular cylindrical tube (that of the vortex core) of uniform radius ﬁlled with

a homogeneous rareﬁed gas (Newtonian viscous ﬂuid). The wall of the tube (or the interface

between the inner vortex core and the outside part of it) is not absolutely rigid, on which

is imposed axisymmetric travelling sinusoidal waves of moderate amplitude a (z is the axial

coordinate in the wave propagation direction). The radial displacement from the mean position

of the wall or the interface (r = rw) is thus presumed to be η, where η = a cos[2π(z − ct)/λ],

λ is the wave length, and c the wave speed (cf. Fig. 1). Axisymmetric motion is assumed

with r measured in the direction normal to the mean position of the wall. u, v are the velocity

components in the z- and r-directions, respectively.

Here, S1 ≡ S1(r) = φφ∗
to those for E. We can use these equations to determine the solution up to O(ǫ2). The boundary

rr − φrrφ∗, S2 ≡ S2(r) = φφ∗

conditions are not linearized. Equations (14-16) account for the eﬀect of satisfying the velocity-

slip condition at the wavy interface, rather at the mean position of the interface.

To illustrate the nature of the solution, particularly with respect to the eﬀects of nonlinearities

in convective acceleration and boundary conditions, we shall consider the important case of

pumping in the absence of the zeroth-order pressure-gradient; i.e., when (∂p/∂z)0 = 0. However,
a simple superposition of a pressure-driven ﬂow corresponding to equation (7) with K0 ∼ O(ǫ2)
is permissible.

2.1 Originally Quiescent Environment

To simplify the approach and obtain preliminary analytical solutions of above complicated

equations and boundary conditions, we only consider the case in which (∂p/∂z)0 vanishes or

K0 = ψ0 = 0. Kn is presumed to be comparable with the order of magnitude O(ǫ) and will be
rescaled ﬁrstly (like ˆKn) and then adopted by the same representation in the following. Hence

equations (9-10) become

φ0r(1) = 0;

together with the condition that the velocity, i.e., (φr/r)|r=0 remains ﬁnite along the axis of the

tube (at r = 0). After lengthy algebraic manipulations, we obtain

φ0r = Q0 r(1 − r2);

φ = ArI1(¯αr) + BrI1(αr),

where Q0 is an integration constant; A = A0/det, B = B0/det; A0 = αI0(α)/2, B0 = − ¯αI0(¯α)/2;

and

det = ¯αI0(¯α)I1(α) − αI0(α)I1(¯α).

Thus, as far as the mean ﬂow is concerned D is the only term which participates in the solution

as long as only terms of O(ǫ) are retained. We have no need to consider E when considering the

mean free ﬂow. Actually, with equations (12,21) and the rearrangement of both sides, we have

Dr(r) = (a1 + a2)r + 2a2r ln r + a0r3 + ¯G(r),

¯G(r) ≡ −α2Re2G(r),

(26)

where a2 must be zero as the axial velocity which is proportional to Dr/r remains ﬁnite at r = 0.
Besides, from the expression of D(r), we know that ¯G(r)/r = 0 at r = 0.

From equations (22-23,25), we know that P0 = −4a0. a0 or P0 is then proportional to the

time-averaged pressure-gradient (on the axis) accompanying the peristaltic motion and now

Dr(r) = [ζ − ¯G(1)]r + a0[r3 − r] + ¯G(r).

3 Results and Discussion

Our numerical calculations conﬁrm that the mean streamwise velocity distribution (averaged

over time) due to the induced motion by the wavy elastic interface in the case of free (vacuum)
pumping is dominated by R0 (or Kn) and the parabolic distribution −P0(1 − r2). R0 which

8

deﬁnes the boundary value of Dr has its origin in the y-gradient of the ﬁrst-order streamwise

velocity distribution. Note that the Reynolds number here is based on the wave speed. The
physical trend herein is also the same as those reported before13−14,20 for the slip-ﬂow eﬀects.

The slip produces decoupling with the inertia of the wavy interface.

Now, let us deﬁne a critical reﬂux condition as one for which the mean velocity U (r) equals

to zero at the center-line r = 0. With the equation of U , we have P0cr = Re(∂p/∂z)2 =
−4[α2Re2G(1) + R0], which means the critical reﬂux condition is reached when P0 has above
value. Pumping against a positive forcing greater than the critical value would result in a back-

ward transport (reﬂux) in the central region of the stream. This critical value depends on α,

Re, and Kn. There will be no reﬂux if the pressure gradient is smaller than this P0. Thus, for

some P0 values less than P0cr , the superﬂow will keep moving forward. On the contrary, parts

of the ﬂow will move backward if P0 > P0cr .

As reported in Refs. 8 or 17, the rather small critical velocity (≤ 20µm/s) observed shows

an apparent dissipation or attenuation of the superﬂow. Thus, we present some of the val-

ues of P0(α, Re; Kn = 0, 0.15) corresponding to freezed or zero-volume-ﬂow-rate states (cf.
1
0 U (r)dr = 0) in Table 1 where the wave number (α) has the range :
Chu in Ref. 15) (
R
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9; the Reynolds number (Re)= 0.1, 1, 10, 25, 50 and 100.

These freezed states might be similar to that reported in Ref. 16 (the nonclassical rotational
inertia signal (NCRI) is not a universal property of solid 4He but can be eliminated through an

annealing of the solid helium sample).

We observe that as Kn increases from zero to 0.15, the critical P0 decreases signiﬁcantly (cf.
Fig. 2). The quantum slip parameter13 which is represented in terms of Kn (via the mean free
path13,14) is temperature dependent in essence but is only relaxed in the boundaries (weakly

compressible cases here). This kind of boundary-dominated ﬂows resemble those reported in

Ref. 18 by Sasaki et al. For the same Kn, once Re is larger than 10, critical reﬂux values P0

drop rapidly and the wave-modulation eﬀect (due to α) appears. The latter observation might

be interpreted as the strong coupling between the interface and the inertia of the streaming

superﬂow. The illustration of the velocity ﬁelds for those zero-ﬂux (zero-volume-ﬂow-rate) or

freezed states are shown in Figure 3. There is one wave number : α = 0.8 and the Reynolds

number is 10. Both no-slip and slip (Kn=0.15) cases are presented.

Some remarks could be made about these states : the transport being freezed in the time-

averaged sense for speciﬁc dissipations (in terms of Reynolds number which is the ratio of

wave-inertia and viscous shearing eﬀects) and wave numbers (due to the wavy interface or other
ﬂuctuations) for either no-slip and slip cases. These resemble those reported quite recently16−18.

Meanwhile, the time-averaged transport induced by the wavy interface is proportional to the

square of the amplitude ratio (although the small amplitude waves being presumed), as can be

seen in Eqn. (11), which is qualitatively the same as that presented in Ref. 11 for analogous

9

interfacial problems.

In brief summary, the entrained transport (either postive or negative and there is possibility :

freezing) due to the wavy interface is mainly tuned by the P0 for ﬁxed Re. Meanwhile, P0cr

depends strongly on the Knudsen number (Kn, a rarefaction measure) instead of Re or α. These

results (cf. Table 1 and Fig. 2) might explain why there are rather small critical velocities for

superﬂows in the temperature range (similar to the eﬀect represented by the quantum slip pa-
rameter : Kn here) where a supersolidity is observed8,17 or the disappearance of supersolidity
through an annealing of the solid helium sample16. We shall investigate much more complicated
problems21,22 in the future.

Fig. 3 Demonstration of the zero-ﬂux states : the mean velocity ﬁeld U (r) for
wave numbers α = 0.8. The Reynolds number is 10. Kn is the rarefaction measure
(the mean free path of the particles divided by the characteristic length).
The integration of U (r) w.r.t. r for these velocity ﬁelds gives zero volume ﬂow rate.

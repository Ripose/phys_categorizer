Abstract

The Cuachy problem for the 3D vortical ﬂow of ideal barotropic ﬂuid is
considered. It is shown that the solution of the Cauchy problem is unique,
if one considers seven dynamic equations for seven dependent variables: the
density ρ, the velocity v and Lagrangian variables ξ = {ξ1, ξ2, ξ3}, labeling
the ﬂuid particles.
If one considers only the closed (Euler) system of four
equations for four dependent variables ρ, v, the solution is not unique. The
fact is that the Euler system describes both the ﬂuid motion at ﬁxing labeling
and the evolution of the ﬂuid labeling, whose evolution is described by the Lin
constraints (equations for variables ξ). If one ignores the Lin constraints at
the solution of the Euler system, (or one considers the Lin constraints on the
basis of the solution of the Euler system), nonunique solution of the Cauchy
problem is obtained.

equations

where ρ = ρ (t, x) is the ﬂuid density, v = v (t, x) is the ﬂuid velocity, p = p (ρ) =
ρ2E (ρ) is the pressure and E (ρ) is the ﬂuid internal energy per unit mass. Motion
of the ﬂuid particle in the given velocity ﬁeld v (t, x) is described by equations

The system of seven equations (1.1) - (1.3) form the complete system of dynamic
equations, describing the ﬂuid motion. The system of equations (1.1) - (1.3) is not
uniform in the sense, that equations (1.1), (1.2) are partial diﬀerential equations,
whereas the equations (1.3) are ordinary diﬀerential equations.

Usually one ignores equations (1.3) and considers the system (1.1), (1.2) as dy-
namic equations, describing the ﬂuid motion. Such an approach is conditioned by
the fact, that the system (1.1), (1.2) is a closed system of diﬀerential equations,
which can be solved without a reference to system (1.3). The solution of ordinary
diﬀerential equations (1.3) is an easier problem, than a solution of partial diﬀerential
equations (1.1), (1.2). If we have succeeded to solve the Euler system (1.1), (1.2),
we may hope to solve also the system (1.3). Besides, in many cases the solution of
equations (1.3) is of no interest.

The idea, that taking into account solutions of equations (1.3), we may inﬂuence
on the solution of the Euler system (1.1), (1.2) seems to be delusive. However,
taking into account of equations (1.3), we may transform the Euler system (1.1),
(1.2) to the form which, takes into account initial conditions for variables ρ and v
and introduce them into dynamic equations. This circumstance may be useful, if we
are interested in global properties of the ﬂuid ﬂow, described by dynamic equations
(1.1), (1.2) and initial conditions together.

To carry out this idea we transform ordinary equations (1.3) to the form

∂ξ
∂t

+ (v∇) ξ = 0,

ξ = {ξ1, ξ2, ξ3}

(1.4)

where ξ (t, x) = {ξ1 (t, x) , ξ2 (t, x) , ξ3 (t, x)} are three independent integrals of equa-
tions (1.3). The equations (1.4) are known as the Lin constraints [1]. The system
of equations (1.4) is equivalent to the system (1.3) in the sense that the system of
ordinary equations

dt
1

=

dx1
v1 =

dx2
v2 =

dx3
v3 ,

(1.5)

associated with the partial diﬀerential equations (1.4), coincides with (1.3). The in-
tegrals ξ are constant on the world line of any ﬂuid particle. If they are independent,
they may label world lines of the ﬂuid particles.

The system of seven equations (1.1), (1.2), (1.4) for seven dependent variables
ρ, v, ξ is uniform in the sense, that all equations are the partial diﬀerential equations
and all dependent variables ρ, v, ξ are functions of independent variables t, x.

The system of seven equations (1.1), (1.2), (1.4) is invariant with the relabeling

group of transformations

α = 1, 2, 3,

Existence of the symmetry group (1.6) for the system of seven dynamic equations
(1.1), (1.2), (1.4) admits one to integrate partly the system. As a result of this

2

integration one obtains three arbitrary functions of variables ξ, and the order of the
system is reduced to four equations.

Solution of the Euler system (1.1), (1.2) with initial conditions

ρ (0, x) = ρin (x) ,

v (0, x) = vin (x)

(1.7)

may be presented in the form

ρ (t, x) = ρin (ξ)

∂ (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)
∂ (x1, x2, x3)

,

v (t, x) = ∇ϕ + (vin (ξ) ∇) ξ

where the quantities ϕ, ξ are functions of t, x satisfying the four equations

The equations (1.9), (1.10) should be solved at the initial conditions

ξ (0, x) = ξin (x) = x,

ϕ (0, x) = ϕin (x) = 0

(1.11)

The quantity E = E (ρ) is the ﬂuid internal energy per unit mass. The quantities
Ωin (ξ) are deﬁned by the relations

(cid:9)

The quantity ω = ω (t, ξ) is an indeﬁnite quantity, which is not determined from
initial conditions. The fact, that the expressions (1.8) together with (1.9) - (1.13)
are solutions of the Euler system (1.1), (1.2), can be tested by means of the direct
substitution and subsequent identical transformations. The indeﬁnite quantity ω
disappears as a result of these transformations. Appearance of indeﬁnite quantity
in equations (1.9), (1.10) and, hence, in (1.8) means that the the solution of the
Cauchy problem for the Euler system (1.1), (1.2) is not unique. How is it possible?
How can the Lin constraints (1.4) inﬂuence on the solution of the closed system of
dynamic equations?

We try to resolve this problem and to understand, what is a real reason of
nonuniqueness of solution of the Cauchy problem. We start from the point, that
the ideal barotropic ﬂuid is a dynamical system, whose dynamic equations can be
obtained from the variational principle.

2 Generalized stream function

Let us note that the quantities ξ may be considered to be the generalized stream
function (GSF), because ξ have two main properties of the stream function.

1. GSF ξ labels world lines of ﬂuid.
2. Some combinations of the ﬁrst derivatives of any ξ satisfy the continuity

equation identically.

where jk = {j0, j1, j2, j3} = {ρ, ρv} is the 4-vector of ﬂux. Here and in what follows,
a summation over two repeated indices is produced (0-3) for Latin indices and (1-3)
for Greek ones. The Jacobian determinant J = Jξ/x

A use of Jacobians in the description of the ideal ﬂuid goes up to Clebsch [2, 3],
who used Jacobians in the expanded form.
It was rather bulky. We use a more
rational designations, when the 4-ﬂux and other essential dynamic quantities are
presented in the form of derivatives of the principal Jacobian J. Dealing with the
generalized stream function, the following identities are useful

Example. Application of the stream function for integration of equations, describ-

ing the 2D stationary ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid.

Dynamic equations have the form

ux + vy = 0,

∂y (uux + vuy) = ∂x (uvx + vvy)

(2.6)

where u and v are velocity components along x-axis and y-axis respectively.

4

Introducing the stream function ψ by means of relations

u = −ψy,

v = ψx

(2.7)

we satisfy the ﬁrst equation (2.6) identically and obtain for the second equation
(2.6) the relations

ψyψxyy − ψxψyyy = −ψyψxxx + ψxψxxy
= ψx
ψy

ψxyy + ψxxx

ψxxy + ψyyy

which can be rewritten in the form

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

∂ (ω, ψ)
∂ (x, y)

= 0,

ω ≡ ψxx + ψyy

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

where ω is the vorticity of the ﬂuid ﬂow. The general solution of equation (2.9) has
the form

where Ω is an arbitrary function of ψ.

For the irrotational ﬂow the vorticity Ω (ψ) = 0, and we obtain instead (2.9)

ω = ψxx + ψyy = Ω (ψ)

ψxx + ψyy = 0

One obtains the unique solution of (2.10) inside of a closed region of 2D space
provided, that the value ψ|Σ of the stream function ψ is given on the boundary Σ of
this region. The diﬀerential structure of equations (2.9) and (2.10) is similar. One
should expect, that giving the value ψ|Σ of the stream function ψ on the boundary
Σ, one obtains the unique solution of the equation (2.10). But it is not so, because
the indeﬁnite function Ω (ψ) is not given, and it cannot be determined from the
boundary condition, because the nature of the function Ω (ψ) is another, than the
nature of the boundary conditions. First, if the ﬂow contains closed stream lines,
which do not cross the boundary, one cannot determine the values of Ω on these
stream lines from the boundary conditions. But for determination of the unique
solution the values of Ω on the closed stream lines must be given. Second, boundary
conditions are given arbitrarily. The function Ω cannot be given arbitrarily. For
those stream lines, which cross the boundary more than once, the values of Ω on
the diﬀerent segments of the boundary are to be agreed. Thus, the nonuniqueness
of the solution, connected with the indeﬁnite function Ω has another nature, than
the nonuniqueness, connected with the insuﬃciency of the boundary conditions.

3 Derivation of hydrodynamic equations from the

variational principle

We use the variational principle for the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations
(1.1), (1.2), (1.4). The action functional has the form

for the 4-ﬂux

jk = ρ0 (ξ)

k = 0, 1, 2, 3

(3.2)

∂J
∂ξ0,k

,

Note, the expression for the 4-ﬂux (3.2) satisﬁes the ﬁrst equation (2.1) identically,
because the expression (3.2) may be reduced to the form of the second relation (2.1)
by means of a change of variables ξ

˜ξ0 = ξ0,

˜ξ1 =

ρ0 (ξ) dξ1,

˜ξ2 = ξ2,

˜ξ3 = ξ3

(3.8)

There are two ways of dealing with this equation:

1. Elimination of GSF ξ, which leads to the Euler equations.
2. Integration, which leads to appearance of arbitrary functions.

The ﬁrst way: elimination of GSF
Convoluting (3.8) with ξl,i and using dynamic equations (3.2), we obtain

jk∂ipk − jk∂kpi = 0,

i = 0, 1, 2, 3

(3.9)

Substituting pk and jk from relations (3.3) and (3.4), we obtain the Euler dy-

(3.10)

The continuity equation (1.2) is a corollary of equations (3.2) and identity (2.1).

Finally the Lin constraints (3.4) are corollaries of the ﬁrst identity (2.4) and

dynamic equations (3.2), (3.3), (3.4).

The second way: integration of the equation for pk
Let us consider the equations (3.8) as linear diﬀerential equations for pk. The

general solution of (3.8) has the form

(3.11)
where gα (ξ) , α = 1, 2, 3 are arbitrary functions of ξ, ϕ = g0 (ξ0) is a new variable
instead of ﬁctitious variable ξ0. Substituting expressions

pk = (∂kϕ + gα (ξ) ∂kξα) ,

k = 0, 1, 2, 3

∂spk = (∂s∂kϕ + gα (ξ) ∂s∂kξα) +

∂kξα∂sξβ

(3.12)

∂gα (ξ)
∂ξβ

in (3.8) and using the ﬁrst identity (2.4), we see, that the relations (3.12) satisfy the
equations (3.8) identically.

We may substitute (3.11) in the action (3.1), or introduce (3.11) by means of the
Lagrange multipliers. (the result is the same). We obtain the new action functional

Note, that eliminating the variables ϕ and ξ from dynamic equations (3.17) -

(3.19), we obtain the Euler dynamic equations (1.1).

the last equation is equivalent to (1.1).

Note, that the Euler equations (1.1) are obtained at any form of the arbitrary
function ω (t, ξ) in the equations (3.23), because the equations (3.23) are used in
the form (3.19), where the form of ω (t, ξ) is unessential.

If ω (t, ξ) 6= 0, the dynamic equations (3.23) describe a violation of the Lin
constraints (1.4). The transformation (3.23) of the Lin constraints means a change
of the ﬂuid labeling. Note that relabeling (1.6) does not violate the Lin constraints.

the Lin constraints (1.4) with respect to ˜ξ with initial conditions ˜ξ (0, x) = x

∂0˜ξα + (v∇) ˜ξα = 0,

˜ξα (0, x) = xα,

α = 1, 2, 3

(3.34)

If the velocity v is deﬁned by relations (1.8) - (1.12), it satisﬁes the Euler equations
and associates with the generalized stream function ξ (t, x), satisfying the relation
(3.23).

In general, the quantities ˜ξ and ξ are diﬀerent. Let

η = ˜ξ − ξ

(3.36)

It follows from (3.34) and (3.35) that mismatch η between ˜ξ and ξ is determined
by the relation

∂0ηα+v (t, x) ∇ηα+

εαβγΩβγ (ξ (t, x)) = 0,

ηα (0, x) = 0,

Thus, the quantities ξ in relations (1.8) - (1.12) is not a real generalized stream
function, because the variables ξ1, ξ2, ξ3 do not label, in general, world lines of the
ﬂuid particles. The variables carry out, in general, a pseudo-labeling. The real label-
ing of the ﬂuid world lines is carried out by variables ˜ξ, satisfying the Lin constraints
(3.34). Pseudo-labeling ξ coincides with the real labeling ˜ξ, if ω (t, ξ (t, x)) ≡ 0. In
this case we have the unique solution of the Cauchy problem for the vortical 3D ﬂow
of the barotropic ﬂuid.

In the general case, when ˜ξ 6= ξ and pseudo-labeling ξ ”ﬂoats”, we have the
unique solution of the Cauchy problem for the Euler equations, provided the pseudo-
labeling ξ is ﬁxed, i.e. the form of function ω (t, ξ (t, x)) is ﬁxed.

Existence of pseudo-labeling ξ puts a very important question, whether a solution
of the Euler equations with ˜ξ 6= ξ describes a real ﬂow of the barotropic ﬂuid, or the
solution of the Cauchy problem describes a real ﬂow only in the case, when ˜ξ = ξ.
It is a diﬃcult problem, which needs a further investigation.

We believe, that any solution of the Euler equations describes a real ﬂow of
the barotropic ﬂuid, because the labeling procedure is rather conditional, when the
”ﬂuid particle” contains many molecules, which can pass from one ﬂuid particle
to another one. This intermixing eﬀect one can see in the ﬁgure, where dashed
lines show real trajectories of the gas particles, whereas solid lines show lines of
the constant labeling ξ. In the ﬁgure the intermixing eﬀect is rather rough. In the
considered case of the Cauchy problem this eﬀect is inﬁnitesimal. It increases with
increase of time.

10

Remark. We do not think, that the pseudo-labeling is the only reason, why the
solution of the Cauchy problem is not unique, because the example of the 2D sta-
tionary ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid shows some designs of insuﬃciency of boundary
conditions.

which does not vanish, in general. Then the problem of pseudo-labeling is removed
and the solution of the Cauchy problem becomes to be unique.

In reality, we may control the solution only via initial conditions. We may give

the two-dimensional initial conditions, i.e.

∂3vin (x) = 0,

∂3ρin (x) = 0,

One cannot control indeﬁnite quantity ω (t, ξ), which may depend on x3. The equa-
tion (4.6) generates the problem of pseudo-labeling and the 3D vortical ﬂow. The
ﬂow with the two-dimensional initial conditions turns into three-dimensional vortical
ﬂow.

5 Conclusions

Solution of the Cauchy problem for the vortical ﬂow of ideal barotropic ﬂuid is
not unique, if we solve only the Euler system of hydrodynamic equations without
consideration of the Lin constraints.

Solution of the Cauchy problem for the vortical ﬂow of ideal barotropic ﬂuid is
unique, if we solve the Euler system of dynamic equations together with the Lin
constraints.

The question is open, whether the Euler system of hydrodynamic equations

describes always a real ﬂow of ideal barotropic ﬂuid, .

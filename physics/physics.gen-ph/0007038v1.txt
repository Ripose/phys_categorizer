Abstract

An “analytic continuation” of a Hermitian matrix representing the
conventional fermion-number operator, leads to a new, and unconven-
tional, internal description of quarks and leptons. This phenomenolog-
ical description, unlike the conventional standard-model description,
is capable of explaining, among other things, why there are just three
families of quarks and leptons. These facts provide indirect evidence
that the analytic continuation in question somehow reﬂects physics at
the Planck level where ﬂavor degrees-of-freedom presumably originate.

Introduction and Background

Given the number of ﬂavors of quarks and leptons, and an appropriate
(renormalizable) lagrangian, the so-called “accidental symmetries” of the la-
grangian [1] are known to “explain” the separate conservation of various
(global) “charges” (e.g., lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, charm,
truth, beauty, electron-, muon- and tau-numbers). However, there is nothing
in such lagrangians, or their associated accidental symmetries, that would

explain quarks and leptons, or tell us how many ﬂavors of quarks and lep-
tons to include. What is needed is a “spectrum-generating” mechanism for
these particles.

The current “consensus” in particle physics, at least among string theo-
rists, seems to be that fundamental-fermion ﬂavor degrees-of-freedom arise
at the Planck level [2, 3]—or possibly at T eV energies in the event that the
extra dimensions are “large” [4]—in a theory of superstrings. The purpose
of the present paper is to identify an apparently diﬀerent, but probably com-
plementary, (phenomenological) spectrum-generating mechanism that arises
in what seems to be a most unlikely way.

We have found that an “analytic-continuation” [5] of a Hermitian ma-
trix F(op) representing the conventional fermion-number operator, from an
external spacetime and Hilbert-space setting to a new internal (real) non-
Euclidean space—F(op) is continued to a real, generally non-diagonal matrix
F(v) involving a single real parameter v—“automatically” leads to a new de-
scription of fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) in which families are
replicated and there are just three families. The fact that this happens, sug-
gests that there is some deep connection between the result of the aforemen-
tioned “analytic-continuation,” namely F(v), and Planck-level physics where
ﬂavor degrees-of-freedom, and family-replication, presumably originate.

The work presented here is based on a little-known book by the author
[6] wherein many of the consequences of using F(v) to describe fundamental
fermions, are worked out in much greater detail than in the present paper.
And, conversely, certain themes that were only alluded to in [6], such as the
“analytic-continuation” F(op) → F(v), are discussed in much greater detail
here. The author hopes that the following relatively brief “overview” and
extension of [6] will serve to increase awareness of these new ideas among
particle physicists.

2.0 The Conventional Fermion-Number Operator

Consider the situation, presumably at some high energy, where we are deal-
ing with “free” (isolated) leptons or “analytically free” quarks. Suppose we
want to describe the scalar fermion-number carried by these particles. And,
suppose further that the energies involved are not so high that quantum ﬁeld-
theory (QFT) breaks down. Under these conditions the fermion-number can
be represented by a U(1)-type scalar “charge” [7, 8], namely, a charge asso-
ciated with the (continuous) group of unitary matrices U of order 1 known

2

as U(1).

The fermion-number operator, which can be represented by a Hermitian
matrix F(op), is said to generate these so-called “gauge” (or phase) trans-
formations, which in turn act on fermion and antifermion quantum states in
Hilbert space. That is, given that α is a real phase one has

U = eiαF(op),

(1)

and for inﬁnitesimal transformations [i.e., ei δα F(op) = 1+i δα F(op)] acting on
single-particle (free or “asymptotically free”) fermion and antifermion states
|pi and |pi, respectively, one easily establishes that (the fermion-number
“charges” are fm = −fa = 1 for matter and fa for antimatter)

U|pi = ei δα fm|pi
U|pi = ei δα fa|pi,

since, by deﬁnition, F(op) obeys the eigenvalue equations

F(op)|pi = fm|pi
F(op)|pi = fa|pi.

(2)

(3)

Finally, the assumption that the Hamiltonian H is invariant under U,

namely

H = UHU †,

ensures that H and F(op) commute

[F(op), H] = 0,

(4)

(5)

as can be veriﬁed by diﬀerentiating UHU † with respect to α. Hence, the total
fermion-number (the number of fermions minus the number of antifermions)
is a constant of the motion.

2.1 Matrix representation of the fermion-number op-

erator

Because the matrix F(op) involves just two kinds of quantum states (3),
namely |pi and |pi, it can be expressed as a 2 × 2 diagonal Hermitian matrix

3

(see below), where one of the adjustable parameters (θ) is a ﬁxed constant
(up to 2π) and the other (φ) is freely adjustable. In particular,

where

F(op) = (cid:18) cos θ

sin θe−iφ

sin θe+iφ − cos θ (cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)cos θ=1
σz = (cid:18) fm 0

fa (cid:19)

0

= σz,

(6)

(7)

is one of the familiar Pauli matrices.

This form for F(op) is consistent with (3) where the normalization and
orthogonality conditions, namely hp|pi = hp|pi = 1 and hp|pi = hp|pi = 0,
respectively, directly yield

F(op) = (cid:18) hp|F(op)|pi

hp|F(op)|pi

,
,

hp|F(op)|pi

hp|F(op)|pi (cid:19) = σz.

(8)

Note that owing to (7) and (8), cos θ < 1 in (6) is excluded. Here it should
also be noted that trF(op) = fm + fa = 0, detF(op) = fm · fa = −1, and
F2(op) = I2 is the 2 × 2 identity matrix.

3.0 The Continuation From F(op) to F(v)

Now perform an “analytic continuation” [5] on F(op), namely F(op) → F(v),
which maintains F(v) real and cos θ ≥ 1. This can only be accomplished
by continuing θ from a real to an imaginary number, and by maintaining
e−iφ imaginary.
In particular, to maintain F(v) real, we must make the
replacements θ → iv and e−iφ → ∓i, where v is a real number. Then

F(v) = (cid:18) cos θ

sin θe−iφ

sin θe+iφ − cos θ (cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)θ=iv,e−iφ=∓i
∓ sinh v − cosh v (cid:19) ,

± sinh v

or

F(v) = (cid:18) cosh v

(9)

(10)

where, just as for F(op) the eigenvalues of F(v) are fm and fa, and so we
have trF(v) = fm + fa = 0, detF(v) = fm · fa = −1, and F2(v) = I2.

4

In [6, p. 50 and 54] it is shown that only the upper signs in (10) have
physical signiﬁcance and v ≥ 0. And, just what is the physical signiﬁcance
of F(v)?

Because the continuation “connects” F(op) and F(v), it is natural to as-
sume that both F(op) and F(v) describe, or represent, aspects of the fermion
number (i.e., the matter-antimatter “degree-of-freedom”). However, unlike
F(op), F(v) will be shown to describe additional “degrees-of-freedom” such
as the “up”-“down” and quark-lepton “degrees-of-freedom.” Moreover, it
is abundantly clear from (10) that the the generally non-Hermitian (when
v 6= 0) matrix F(v)—unlike the Hermitian matrix F(op) in (8), which acts
on Hilbert space—does not act on a Hilbert space in an external spacetime
setting [9].

3.1 A new internal non-Euclidean space

When the matrix F(v) acts on a real column-vector {a, b}, it leaves the
quadratic form a2 − b2, invariant. Therefore, the 2-space metric is non-
Euclidean or “Lorentzian”, and can be represented by the matrix

g = (cid:18) 1

0 −1 (cid:19) .

0

(11)

Given this metric, the scalar product of two real vectors assumes the form

(a, b){e, f } = ae − bf.

Similarly, the square of a real vector is given by

(a, b){a, b} = a2 − b2.

(12)

(13)

Here ( , ) is a row vector while { , } is a (conformable) column vector.
Now let us demonstrate that these scalar-products transform like charges
instead of probabilities as they would if we were still dealing with a Hilbert
space.

3.2 Charge conjugation

The matrix X, where X = X−1 or X2 = I2 , given by

X = (cid:18) 0 1/d

0 (cid:19) ,

d

5

(14)

transforms F(v) to is C-reversed counterpart. In particular, given that the
components of F(v), in diagonal form [i.e., F(v)diag = σz], transform like
(global) “charges” (fm and fa), the general similarity transformation must
be such that

X F(v) X−1 = −F(v),

(15)

for any real d. However, since X should convert a real vector {a, b} to its
orthogonal antimatter-counterpart

we are forced to require

which means that

X {a, b} = {b/d, ad},

(a, b){b/d, ad} = 0,

ab/d − abd = 0,

(16)

(17)

(18)

or d2 = 1. Therefore, we have two choices for d, namely, d = ±1. Which one
describes the physics of fundamental fermions?

Clearly, when d = ±1, the square of any vector, namely,

(a, b){a, b} = a2 − b2,

(19)

changes signs (is C-reversing) under X. However, in general, the components
of a vector {a, b} do not change signs under X, i.e., they are not C-reversing.
For example, when d = +1 in (14), the components of real vectors such as
{a, b} are not C-reversing charge-like quantities, which means that we can-
not represent C-reversing (Lorentz 4-scalar) charges such as electric-charge,
charm, isospin or beauty as components of such vectors when d = +1. How-
ever, when d = −1, both the square of {a, b} and its components a and b
change signs (are C-reversing) under X, and can be used to represent such
charges. Therefore, from an experimental standpoint, d = +1 is excluded
(see Ref. 6, p. 8).

We conclude that the matrix X, which plays the role of charge-conjugation
(with respect to these global 2-space charges only) in this non-Euclidean 2-
space, is proportional to one of the familiar Pauli matrices, namely,

X = −σx.

6

(20)

The foregoing properties of the non-Euclidean charge-like scalars, leads

to the following conjecture:

The global (ﬂavor-deﬁning) charges associated with the aforementioned “ac-
cidental” symmetries (see Section 1.0), and the global charges associated with
the non-Euclidean 2-space, are (essentially) one and the same charges.

As shown in the next section if this conjecture is true it means, among
other things, that simultaneous fundamental-fermion ﬂavor eigenstates can
be partially speciﬁed using an appropriate (mutually-commuting) combina-
tion of these (global) 2-space charges [10, 11].

4.0 Representing Flavor Eigenstates and Flavor Dou-

blets in the 2-Space

The continuation from the 2-D Hilbert space to the 2-D non-Euclidean “charge”
space, turns out to mean that individual ﬂavors of fundamental fermions can
be partially represented in an unconventional way by geometric objects (in
the non-Euclidean 2-space) which diﬀer from a quantum state, but from
which the quantum states can be inferred or eﬀectively constructed. In par-
ticular, in the non-Euclidean 2-space, an object we call a “vector triad”
represents “up”-“ down” type ﬂavor doublets of fundamental fermions—the
“up”-“down” type ﬂavor dichotomy. That is, the components of the vec-
tors associated with a given vector-triad are observable (Lorentz 4-scalar)
“charges,” which can be used to (partially) deﬁne the two ﬂavor-eigenstates
in a ﬂavor doublet [10, 11].

4.1 Flavor eigenstates

As demonstrated in detail in [6, pp. 16–18], given the charge-like (C-reversing)
observables associated with the description involving F(v), namely, the real
C-reversing scalar-components of various matrices and vectors deﬁned on the
internal non-Euclidean 2-space, it is possible to write down ﬂavor eigenstates
[10, 11].

What one does is to identify the mutually-commuting C-reversing “charges”

(call them Ci) or charge-like quantum numbers associated with a particular
ﬂavor, and then write the corresponding simultaneous ﬂavor-eigenstate as

|C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cni.

(21)

7

Here C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cn, are the “good” charge-like quantum numbers (charges)
associated with a particular ﬂavor. It happens that these observable real-
numbers can be identiﬁed with quantum numbers such as electric charge,
strangeness, charm, the third-component of (global) isospin, truth and beauty
(See Ref. 6, p. 72). To discover what charges describe a particular ﬂavor we
must ﬁrst identify the vector-triad associated with that ﬂavor.

Now, each vector-triad represents a ﬂavor doublet, not just an individual
ﬂavor. That is, vector-triads provide information on two quantum states
(simultaneous ﬂavor-eigenstates) associated with ﬂavor doublets. Therefore,
vector-triads represent both individual ﬂavors and ﬂavor doublets. Here we
simply summarize how it is the that non-Euclidean vector-triads represent
both individual ﬂavors and “up”-“down” type ﬂavor-doublets.

4.2 Flavor doublets

Consider the eigenvector (call it Q) of F(v) for fundamental fermions [12].
Since the space on which F(v) “acts” is two-dimensional, the observable
vector Q can be “resolved” into two (no more or less) observable, linearly-
independent vectors, call them U and V, as Q = U + V [13]. Now, because
these three vectors (Q, U, and V) are simultaneous observables, it makes
sense to speak of this “triad” of vectors as being a well deﬁned geometric
object, namely, a “vector triad.”

Recognizing that the components of Q, U and V are C-reversing charge-

like observables we can write these observable “charge” vectors as

Q = {q1, q2}
U = {u1, u2}
V = {v1, v2},

(22)
(23)
(24)

where q1, q2, u1, u2, v1 and v2 are the various observable “charges” (e.g.,
q1 and q2 are found to be electric charges). Given Q = U + V, the non-
Euclidean metric (11), and Eqs. (22) through (24), we ﬁnd the associated
observable quadratic-“charges”

Q2 = U2 + 2U • V + V2

2U • V = 2(u1v1 − u2v2)

U2 = u2
V2 = v2

1 − u2
2
1 − v2
2.

8

(25)
(26)
(27)
(28)

Finally, using the foregoing charges, we can express the two quantum states
(simultaneous ﬂavor-eigenstates) associated with a single vector-triad in the
form of “ket”vectors as follows (Ref. 6, pp. 16–18)

|q1, u1, v1, Q2, U2, 2U • V, V2i,
|q2, u2, v2, Q2, U2, 2U • V, V2i.

(29)

Here, the state |q1, u1, v1, Q2, U2, 2U•V, V2i represents the “up”-type ﬂavor-
eigenstate, and |q2, u2, v2, Q2, U2, 2U • V, V2i represents the corresponding
“down”- type ﬂavor-eigenstate in a ﬂavor doublet of fundamental fermions
[10, 11].

Up to this point in the discussion we have shown that the 2-space de-
scription naturally incorporates the matter-antimatter dichotomy and the
“up”-“down” ﬂavor dichotomy. Now let us demonstrate how quarks and
leptons are incorporated in the new description.

4.3 Distinguishing quarks and leptons

Choosing the upper signs in (10), the matrix F(v) becomes

F(v) = (cid:18) cosh v

− sinh v − cosh v (cid:19) ,

sinh v

(30)

where v is a positive real number [6, p. 50 and 54].

As described in [6, pp. 52–55], the parameter v distinguishes between
quarks and leptons. In particular, the parameter v is found to be quantized
and obeys the “quantum condition”:

v = ln Mc,

(31)

where Mc counts both the number of fundamental fermions in a strongly-
bound composite fermion, and the strong-color multiplicity. That is, Mc =
3 for quarks (strong-color triplets) and Mc = 1 for leptons (strong-color
singlets).

4.3.1 Quark and lepton electric charges

It is shown in (Ref. 6, pp. 52–55, and Ref. 12) that the quark and lepton
electric charges are the “up”-“down” components of the eigenvectors of the

9

matrix F(v). In particular, the quark charges are given by (Mc = 3)

q1(f ) =

(M 2

c − 1)

2Mc(Mc − f )

= +

2
3

q2(f ) = q1(f ) − 1.

for f = +1 and +

1
3

for f = −1 (32)

(33)

Similarly, the lepton electric charges are given by (Mc = 1)

q′
1(f ) =

2(f ) = q′
q′

−(M 2
c − 1)
2Mc(Mc − f )
1(f ) + 1.

= −1 for f = +1 and 0 for f = −1

(34)

(35)

In summary, F(v) is found to provide an explanation for the quark-lepton
“dichotomy” of fundamental fermions in addition to the matter-antimatter,
and “up”-“ down” type ﬂavor-dichotomy.

4.4 Family replication and the number of families

In [6, pp. 59–65] it is shown that ﬂavor doublets (hence families) are replicated
and that there are only three families of quarks and leptons. We refer the
reader to [6] for a full and detailed account. Here we simply outline how this
situation comes about.

By the deﬁnition of a linear-vector 2-space, a 2-vector such as Q can
always be resolved into a pair (no more, or less) of linearly-independent
vectors U and V as Q = U + V (see Sec. 4.2). And, since Q represents a
ﬂavor doublet, so should U and V represent this same ﬂavor doublet. But,
if this is so, diﬀerent vector-resolutions of Q (i.e., diﬀerent vector-triads)
should correspond to diﬀerent ﬂavor-doublets having the same Q. In other
words, ﬂavor doublets should be replicated.

Since Q can be resolved (mathematically) in an inﬁnite number of ways,
we might suppose that there are an inﬁnite number of ﬂavor doublets, and
hence, families. But, because of various “quantum constraints,” it is possible
to show that Q can be resolved in only three physically acceptable ways for
Q-vectors associated with either quarks or leptons. In other words, there can
be only six quark ﬂavors and six lepton ﬂavors, which leads to the (ex post
facto)“prediction” of three quark-lepton families.

10

5.0 Discussion

It is important to understand that the new 2-space description of fundamental
fermions (quarks and leptons) provides a distinction between these particles
that goes beyond diﬀerences that can be explained by mass diﬀerences alone.
For example, in the standard model the only diﬀerence between an electron
and a muon is that they have diﬀerent masses. Otherwise, these particles
experience identical electroweak interactions. Moreover, as described in Sec-
tion 1.0, the separate conservation of electron- and muon-numbers can be
attributed to certain unavoidable “accidental symmetries” associated with
the (renormalizable) lagrangian describing the (electroweak) interactions of
these particles.

Taken at face value, these accidental symmetries would seem to imply
that there are no internal “wheels and gears” that would distinguish an elec-
tron from a muon, for example. But, if the string theories are correct, these
particles would be associated with diﬀerent “handles” on the compactiﬁed
space [see Ref. 3, Vol. 2, p. 408], and so would be diﬀerent in this additional
sense. Likewise, in the present non-Euclidean 2-space description, a variety
of (global) 2-scalars, which are only indirectly related to the accidental sym-
metries of the lagrangian, serve to provide a (further) distinction between
particles such as the electron and muon (see also the conjecture in Sec. 3.2).
A probable experimental signal of such “internal” diﬀerences is to be
found in the recent observations at the Super Kamiokande of bi-maximal
neutrino mixing [14]. Models which begin by positing a neutrino mass-matrix
and associated mixing-parameters, such as the three-generation model pro-
posed by Georgi and Glashow [15], do a good job of describing the observa-
tions. However, bi-maximal mixing may have a deeper explanation in terms
of internal topological-diﬀerences (in the non-Euclidean 2-space) between νe,
and νµ or ντ neutrinos.

With respect to the internal transformation F(v), the topology of the
non-Euclidean “vector triad” (see Sec. 4.2) representing the νe (νµ or ντ ),
is found to be that of a cylinder (M¨obius strip). And, assuming that a
change in topology during neutrino mixing is suppressed by energy “barri-
ers,” or other topological “barriers” (e.g., one cannot continuously deform
a doughnut into a sphere), while neutrino mixing without topology-change
is (relatively) enhanced, one can readily explain the experimental observa-
tion of (nearly) maximal νµ − ντ neutrino mixing—at least maximal νµ − ντ
mixing over long distances, where the foregoing topological inﬂuences would

11

be cumulative [16]. If this explanation is basically correct, then it follows
that the neutrino mass-matrix and associated mixing-parameters needed to
explain bi-maximal neutrino mixing, would be the result, at least in part,
of these deeper (internal) topological diﬀerences between neutrinos, and not
their cause.

6.0 Conclusions

It is widely believed that the explanation for fundamental-fermion (quark
and lepton) family replication is to be found in theories of quantum gravity
(e.g., superstrings). And, yet, as demonstrated here and elsewhere [6], a sim-
ple “analytic continuation” of a Hermitian matrix representing the fermion-
number operator, leads to a new, and unconventional, internal description of
quarks and leptons, which also explains family replication. In particular, this
description, unlike the conventional standard-model description, is capable
of explaining, among other things, the fact that there are just three observed
families of quarks and leptons. We take these facts to be evidence that the
(phenomenological) “analytic continuation” F(op) → F(v), or at least the
result of the continuation F(v), somehow reﬂects physics at the Planck level
where ﬂavor degrees-of-freedom presumably originate.

It seems that the best chance to show that F(v) and Planck-level physics
are related, lies in an appropriate application of superstring theory. Accord-
ingly, the author hopes that the new description of families presented here
(see also Refs. 6 and 16) will encourage string theorists working on so-called
realistic (free-fermionic) three-generation string models (e.g., see Refs. 17,
18), to take up the challenge of showing that these models either do, or do
not, justify the new description.

In spite of the
many successes of the standard model of particle physics, the observed prolif-
eration of matter-ﬁelds, in the form of “replicated” generations or families, is
a major unsolved problem. In this book I propose a new organizing principle
for fundamental fermions, i.e., a minimalistic “extension” of the standard
model based, in part, on the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for matrices. In par-
ticular, to introduce (internal) global degrees of freedom that are capable
of distinguishing all observed ﬂavors, I use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to
generalize the familiar standard-model concept of scalar fermion-numbers f
(i.e., fm = +1 for all fermions and fa = −1 for all antifermions). This the-
orem states that every (square) matrix satisﬁes its characteristic equation.
Hence, if fm and fa are taken to be the eigenvalues of some real matrix F(v)—
a “generalized fermion number”—it follows from this theorem that both f
and F(v) are square-roots of unity. Assuming further that the components
of both F(v) and its eigenvectors are global charge-like quantum observ-
ables, and that F(v) “acts” on a (real) vector 2-space, both the form of F(v)
and the 2-space metric are determined. I ﬁnd that the 2-space has a non-
Euclidean or “Lorentzian” metric, and that various associated 2-scalars serve
as global ﬂavor-deﬁning “charges,” which can be identiﬁed with charges such
as strangeness, charm, baryon and lepton numbers etc.. Hence, these global
charges can be used to describe individual ﬂavors (i.e., ﬂavor eigenstates),
ﬂavor doublets and families. Moreover, because of the aforementioned non-

13

Euclidean constraints, and certain standard-model constraints, I ﬁnd that
these global charges are eﬀectively- “quantized” in such a way that families
are replicated. Finally, because these same constraints dictate that there are
only a limited number of values these charges can assume, I ﬁnd that families
always come in “threes.”

[9] Even though F(v)diag = F(op) = σz, these two matrices act on entirely
diﬀerent spaces, since F(op) is associated with the constant cos θ = 1, and
the variable phase-factor e−iφ, whereas F(v) is associated with the variable
cos θ ≥ 1, and the constant phase-factor e+iφ = +i.

[10] When weak interactions are “turned oﬀ” ﬂavor eigenstates and mass
eigenstates are one and the same. For the most part, when we speak here of
ﬂavor eigenstates, we are referring to the situation where ﬂavor- and mass-
eigenstates are the same.

[11] Strictly speaking, besides the speciﬁcation of global charges, the over-
all quantum state of a fundamental fermion would, necessarily, involve a spec-
iﬁcation of the spin state, the energy-momentum state and so on, together
with a speciﬁcation of the particular mix of local color (gauge)-charges R,
W , B, G and Y carried by each fundamental fermion. This color-mix would
be determined, in turn, by a complementary, local SU(5) color-dependent
gauge description.

[12] Any acceptable 2 × 2 matrix F(v) possesses just two, real linearly-
independent eigenvectors, call them Q and Qc, corresponding to the two
real eigenvalues fm and fa, respectively. Therefore, the matrix F(v) can be
thought of as “producing” the conventional single-particle fermion numbers
fm and fa via the 2-space eigenvalue equations

and

respectively.

F(v)Q = fmQ

F(v)Qc = faQc,

The 2-vector Q (and its scalar components—the electric charges of quarks
and leptons) describes matter, while the linearly-independent 2-vector Qc

describes its antimatter counterpart. The superscript c on Qc is merely a
label signifying antimatter. It is not an exponent or a symbol for complex
conjugation. As such, it signiﬁes only that the 2-vectors Q and Qc are
real vectors associated with (“carried by,” “representing,” etc.)
individual
fundamental-fermions or antifermions, respectively, not state vectors in some
Hilbert space.

Even though the 2-vector Q (Qc) does not represent a quantum state, it
is associated with the phase factor eiα fm (ei α fa) associated with a quantum
state describing matter (antimatter). To see this, replace F(op) in Eq. 1 in
the main text by F(v). Then U is replaced by U ′ where

and

U ′Q = ei α fmQ

U ′Qc = ei α faQc.

Note that because ei n(δα)F(v) = ei αF(v) when n is very large and δα is very
small, but nonzero (i.e., n δα = α), α can be any ﬁnite number ranging from
zero to inﬁnity. Similar arguments apply to the matrix U since U(α)·U(α′) =
U(α + α′).

[13] When we say that the vectors Q, U and V are observables, we mean
that their associated component-“charges” are mutually-commuting simulta-
neous observables. Hence, all of these charge-like components can be known
in principle, at the same time, meaning that the vectors Q, U and V can be
known simultaneously.

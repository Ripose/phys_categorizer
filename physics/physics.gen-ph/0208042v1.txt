Abstract

Abstract Similar to introduce the Lorentz condition in the motion equation of electromagnetic
ﬁeld, the restriction condition is introduced in the motion equations of non-Ablian gauge ﬁelds so
that the equations are simpliﬁed greatly and their wave solutions are obtained. Only in this way, the
Feynman rule’s use become rightful in the calculation of perturbation theory.

PACS numbers: 1110, 1130

Let’s ﬁrst review the motion equation of electromagnetic ﬁeld and its solution. The Lagrangian of

free electromagnetic ﬁeld is

Here

L =

Fµν (x)Fµν (x)

Fµν (x) = ∂µAν (x)

∂νAµ(x)

−

∂µFµν = ∂2Aν

∂ν ∂µAµ = 0

−

From Eq.(1), the motion equation of free electromagnetic ﬁeld can be obtained

On the other hand, Eq.(3) is not a wave equation, so it is improper to be used to describe free
electromagnetic ﬁeld or photon ﬁeld with wave nature. Free electromagnetic ﬁelds or photon ﬁelds
should satisfy wave equation

In order to get it from Eq.(1), the Lorentz condition

is introduced. The spatial solution of Eq.(4) can be written as

Aµ(x) =

aµ(~k)eik·xd3~k

+∞

Z

−∞

Put it into the Lorentz condition, we get

This is a restriction condition about parameters aµ(~k). Only three aµ(~k) are independent among four.
It is proved below that by introducing similar restriction condition, the motion equations of non-
Ablian gauge ﬁelds and their solutions can also be simpliﬁed. The Lagrangian of non-Ablian gauge
ﬁelds with zero masses is

in which

This is a complex non-linear equation, no solution is found up to now. Because it is not a wave
equation, the non-Alebrian gauge ﬁelds seam to have no simple wave solution like Eq.(6).

On the other hand, the middle Bosons described by non-Alebrian gauge ﬁelds are also micro-
particles with wave nature. From this angle, the free non-Alebrian gauge ﬁelds should also have wave
solutions. In fact, in the current perturbation calculations of practical problems, we have actually
supposed that the wave functions of free non-Alebrian gauge particles have the simple forms like
Eq.(6). For example, in the united weak-electric interaction theory, the interaction Hamilitonian
between leptons and W ± particles can be written as

ig
2√2

[W −
µ

¯ψν γµ(1 + γ5)ψl + W +
µ

¯ψlγµ(1 + γ5)ψν]

By using the Feynman rule, the vertex function of interaction between leptons and W ± particles in
momentum space can be written as

ig
2√2

γµ(1 + γ5)δ4(pl + pν

pw)

−

In the formula, we actually acquiesce in that the wave functions of free W ± particles have the simple
wave solutions Eq.(6) similar to leptons. After the integral of transition matrix element is carried
out in coordinate space, the formula (13) is obtained from Eq.(12). If the wave functions of free W ±
particles can not be written as the form of Eq.(6), we can not get vertex δ function, so that energy-
momentum conservation in vertex processes can not be ensured and no any perturbation calculation
can done.

So the diﬃcult position we face is that in order to let perturbation calculation becoming possible,
we should suppose that the wave functions of free non-Alebrian gauge particles have simple form of
the wave. On the other hand, according to the motion equation of free non-Alebrian gauge ﬁelds, the
wave functions of non-Alebrian gauge particles have no simple form of the wave.

This problem can be solved well by introducing a restriction condition in the motion equations of
free non-Alebrian gauge ﬁelds, similar to introduce the Lorentz condition in electromagnetic theory.
For this purpose, in Eq.(11) we let

∂ν ∂µAα

The motion equation of free non-Alebrian gauge ﬁelds is simpliﬁed as

In this way, the wave functions of free non-Alebrian gauge particles can be written as simple wave’s
forms

µ(~k) and is diﬃcult
The formula above is non-linear diﬀerential integral equation about parameters aα
to get its solutions. But in this way, the complexity of wave functions of non-Ablerian gauge particles
µ(~k) and the solutions of non-Abelrian gauge ﬁelds
is transformed into the complexity of parameters aα
can be written as simple forms. There are α restriction equations, so only 3α are independent among
4α aα

µ(~k). For the free non-Ablerian gauge ﬁelds with masses, the motion equation become

µ = 0

(21)

The form of restriction equations are unchanged, we only need to let
α in Eq.(20).
When there exist interactions, the relative interaction item can be added into the formula, but the
form of restriction equation is still unchanged.

Though the motion equations are simpliﬁed after the restriction conditions are introduced, the
form of the Lagrangians of free non-Alberian gauge ﬁelds and interactions between gauge ﬁelds and
other ﬁelds are unchanged. So after the solutions of motion equations of free non-Alberian gauge ﬁelds
are written in the form of Eq.(16), the forms of interactions and practical calculation results are not
eﬀected. In fact, only in this way, we can use the Feynman rules in the calculation of perturbation
theory, otherwise the calculations are completely impossible.

Abstract

The ﬁne structure of hydrogen energy was calculated by
using the usual momentum-wavefunction relation directly,
rather than establishing the well-known Dirac wave equation.
As the results, the energy levels are completely the same as
that of the Dirac wave equation, while the wavefunction is
single component that is quite diﬀerent from Dirac’s four
component wavefunction, the most important thing is that
the present calculation brings out electronic spin in a new
way which has never been reported and indicates that the
electronic spin is a kind of orbital motion.

1 Introduction

As we know, the ﬁne structure and electronic spin in hy-
drogen atom can be exactly calculated by using the Dirac
wave equation which contains four component wavefunc-
tion, the work is a milestone in physics. Up to now, it has
been believed that electronic spin must be theocretically
speciﬁed by Dirac’s four component wavefunction, spin
concept has been developed as one of the most important
properties of elementary particles in high energy physics.
Consider a particle of rest mass m and charge q moving
in an inertial frame of reference with relativistic 4-vector
velocity uµ, it satisﬁes[1]

uµuµ =

c2

−

(1)

where there is not distinction between covariant and con-
travariant components in the Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem. Eq.(1) is just the relativistic energy-momentum
relation when multiplying it by squared mass. Let Aµ
denote vector potential of electromagnetic ﬁeld, substi-
tuting the momentum-wavefunction relation[2]

Note that taking the right side of Eq.(2) as momentum-
operator to replace momentum that appears in a physical
equation is a traditional usage, but in this paper we di-
rectly use the right side of Eq.(2) as momentum as we
have done in Eq.(3). Please note that Eq.(3) is not the
Klein-Gordon wave equation.

In the recent years, H. Y. Cui[3, 4] has reported some
signiﬁcant results of Eq.(3) for certain physical systems.
In this paper I point out that the ﬁne structure of hydro-
gen energy can also be calculated by using Eq.(3), while
its wavefunction has single component in contrast with
Dirac’s wavefunction, the spin eﬀect of electron is also
revealed by Eq.(3) when the hydrogen atom is in a mag-
netic ﬁeld, the present calculation totally does not need
multi-component wavefunction for specifying electronic
spin, and indicates that we should re-recognize spin.

2 The ﬁne structure of hydrogen

energy

In the following, we use Gaussian units, and use me to
denote the rest mass of electron.

In a spherical polar coordinate system (r, θ, ϕ, ict), the
nucleus of hydrogen atom provides a spherically symmet-
ric potential V (r) = e/r for the electron motion. The
wave equation (3) for the hydrogen atom in the energy
iEt/¯h may be written in the spher-
eigenstate ψ(r, θ, ϕ)e−

The result, Eq.(16), is completely the same as that in

energy.

3 The electronic spin

If we put the hydrogen atom into an external uniform
magnetic ﬁeld B which is along the z axis with the vector
potential (Ar, Aθ, Aϕ) = (0, 0, 1

to Eq.(3) the wave equation is given by

In Stern-Gerlach experiment, the angular momentum
of ground state of hydrogen atom is presumed to be zero
according to the usual quantum mechanics, thus ones
need make use of the spin. But in the present calcula-
tion, the so-called spin has been merged with the orbital
motion of the electron.

Recalling that the spin is a mysterious concept even
for very learned persons, we have come to this point:
we can understand the quantum mechanics without the
well-established spin concept, can’t we? without multi-
component wavefunction, can’t we? Bear in mind that
simplicity is always a merit for the physics.

The above two equations are the same as Eq.(6)
and Eq.(7), except for the additional constant term
meB/c¯h. After the similar calculation as the preceding

section, we obtain the energy levels of hydrogen atom in
the magnetic ﬁeld given by

In the usual spectroscopic notation of quantum me-

the result is completely the same as that in the calcula-
tion of the Dirac wave equation for the hydrogen atom,
while the wavefunction is quite diﬀerent from Dirac’s
wavefunction. Besides, the present calculation brings
out spin nature in a new way, indicating that electronic
spin is a kind of orbital motion. The present calcu-
lation is characterized by using the usual momentum-
wavefunction relation directly, it provides an insight into
the foundations of quantum mechanics.

called spin eﬀect has been revealed by Eq.(28) without
spin concept, this result indicates that electronic spin is
a kind of orbital motion.

This has involved our experience in which we have taken
plus sign for the imaginary momentum in x < a and
minus sign in x > b, to satisfy the so-called wave-
attenuating boundary condition for the regions over
the turning points.

In the followings, we use this wave-attenuating bound-
ary condition to determine the sign of double-valued
imaginary momentum: take plus sign in the region over
the left turning point, whereas take minus sign in the
region over the right turning point.

where A and B are two real numbers, then the integration
of Eq.(11) has three possible solutions given by

The second branch of this result is reasonable, because

The deformation made for Cδ has no inﬂuence on the
integration value because the left deformation cancels the
right deformation in the integration due to the opposite
signs of the integrand near the left and right poles. Let C′δ

A.4 discussion: the motion over turning

points

Following the sign change for imaginary momentum over
turning points, discussed in the preceding section, we ﬁnd
that the periodic condition or standing wave condition in
hydrogen atom may written as

a r

sin2 θ

(63)

because the integrations in the regions over the turn-
ing points are eliminated automatically. What are their
physical meanings ? A direct explanation is that it is not
necessary for the electron to enter the regions over the
turning points, in compliance with classical physics.

In addition, the residue theorem we used in the pa-
per gives out accurate results for our integrations, not
approximate ones.

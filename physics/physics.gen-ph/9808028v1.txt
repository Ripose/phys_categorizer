Nonlinear Electrodynamics: One-Electron Atom

D. Palatnik∗

Abstract

From non-linear theory of electromagnetism, suggested in [1], follows that
non-relativistic equation for scalar potential of electron in the ﬁeld of nuclei is
equivalent to respective Schroedinger equation. It’s assumed that electron’s
mass-charge density is a function of electromagnetic potential and background
metric only, in accord with respective formula in [1].

I. INTRODUCTION

In [1] a modiﬁed Einstein-Maxwell theory was suggested. Modiﬁcations pertain to elec-

tromagnetic theory, which becomes non-linear in (dimensionless) vector potential, ˜Aa = lAa.

Here Aa is a potential, given in standard units, and l is a constant. If gab is a background

metric, found from respective Einstein equations, then equations for electromagnetic ﬁeld

are:

˜F ac

4πl2 J a ;

˜F[ab ; c] = 0 .

Here ˜Fab = ∂a ˜Ab

∂b ˜Aa, ˜F ab = Gac Gbe ˜Fce, tensor Gab denotes inverse matrix to Gab =

respectively, both measured in units of mass. In non-relativistic limit the equation for (the

only) component, ˜A0 = sin Ψ = sin(lϕ + ψ), is

∆Ψ =

4πl2c2(µ2 cos Ψ

here ∆ denotes the Laplacian, constructed on respective metric, and ϕ = ϕ(xa) is a scalar

potential in standard units, behaving as a Coulomb one with zero asymptotic on spatial

inﬁnity; ψ is a constant.

II. THE SCHROEDINGER EQUATION

Consider an electron with density distributions (µe

1, µe

2), in the ﬁeld of nuclei, speciﬁed

with (µn

1 , µn

2 ). Introducing potentials ϕe and ϕn generated by electron and nuclei, respec-

tively, one may write

1

Ψ = lϕn + lϕe + ψ = lϕn + Ψe .

(2.1)

Here ϕe (ϕn) are determined by (1.4) with µe

1 and µe

2 (µn

1 and µn

2 ) substituting µ1 and µ2.

Introduced function Ψe satisﬁes equation,

It follows, that mass, m1, makes a contribution ∆m2 to observable electrical charge, m2,

and vice versa:

∆m1 =

m2 tan(lϕn) ;

−

∆m2 = +m1 tan(lϕn) .

Assuming that lϕn

III. CONCLUSION

Obtained equivalence between ﬁeld equations (1.1), (1.2), and the Schoedinger equation

in non-relativistic limit, suggests an interpretation of the wave-function in terms of elec-

tromagnetic potential, ˜Aa. Thus, one may claim that ﬁeld equations (1.1) and (1.2) do

represent relativistic generalization of the Schroedinger equation with the wave function,

˜Ψ = Ψ + ψ, so that ˜A0 = sin Ψ in non-relativistic limit.

As in [1] one may suggest that for the electron’s density one can take expression (2.5)

for r

R, and µ1 = µ2 = 0 for r > R. Parameter R is determined by equation µ1(R) =

≤

µ2(R) = 0, which is equivalent to ˜Ψ(R) = 0. In this case the ﬁeld conﬁguration, describing

interior of the electron, should be sewn together with exterior solution (r > R), which is of

the form Ψe(r) =

l

e
|r + ψ.

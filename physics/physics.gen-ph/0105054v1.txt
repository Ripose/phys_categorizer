The fundamental Einstein-Hopf work that convinced the most part of physicists, since it
had appeared, to take quantum ideas seriously, is reanalysed in this paper. We have studied
the genesis of the work and have found the conclusion made by Einstein and Hopf not so
unambiguous. There may exist classical, not quantum interpretations of the result. T. H.
Boyer proposed one of those in 1969. Unfortunately, his derivation contains a loophole in
its argument. We propose here a new classical derivation of Planck’s radiation law, with the
Einstein-Hopf model being used.

I. INTRODUCTION

According to Einstein’s own statement [1], quantum problems were central to his activity. The photoeﬀect,
the speciﬁc heat of solids, the spontaneous and induced emission, the Bose-Einstein statistics of gases — his
most known results — all were obtained by making use of quantum ideas. More surprising, as it seems to many,
was his following rejection of traditional quantum physics in a form of wave or matrix mechanics in the midst
of 1920’s and later. However, there are few, if any who took note of the fact that almost in a half of early
Einstein’s works he tried to derive quantum eﬀects (in particular Planck’s radiation law) from the standpoint
of classical physics and he achieved a great deal.

In his primary analysis of Planck’s works Einstein [2-4] attracted an attention to the contradiction between the
“electrodinamic” part and the “statistical” part of Planck’s considerations. Namely the derivation of equation

from Maxwell’s electrodynamics was inconsistent with the derivation of the oscillator energy expression

ρ(ω, T ) =

ω2
π2c3 E(ω, T )

E(ω, T ) =

¯hω
e¯hω/kT − 1

,

which is based not upon a classical mechanics and does not have even a correct classical limit, i.e., E(ω, T ) 6=
kT /2 at kT ≫ ¯hω.

If the classical mechanics is not true, writes Einstein, why the Eq. (1), which was obtained by making use of

equation

m

d2x
dt2 + mω

2
0x − Γ

d3x
dt3 = eE(x, t),

must be correct. The Eq. (3) is based upon classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics. Herein ω0 — is
natural frequency of an oscillator, Γ — is a radiation damping constant, E(x, t) — is a stochastic electric ﬁeld
having a Gaussian distribution and named by Planck “natural” radiation.

Essentially, Einstein pointed out that the expression for the number of modes in a unit volume — ω2/π2c3,
(the correct derivation of which is the Eq. (1)) may be erroneous. This remark will be very important for our
further considerations, but now we are going to reconstruct Einstein’s train of thought. So, he put in question
the validity of classical electrodynamics, the correctness of Eq. (3), and suggested that processes of absorption
and emission of radiation should be analysed on a diﬀerent, more general basis. For early Einstein it implied
addressing to purely thermodynamic reasoning and looking for an energy balance equation, by analogy with
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation found by him earlier for the Brownian motion.
In this case an emission
rate could be speciﬁed by radiation friction of an oscillator, and an absorption rate — by the expression for
mean-square ﬂuctuations of radiation. Earlier, in the work [5], he found from thermodynamics the following
general formula for the latter:

In his work [6], Einstein substituted the Planck radiation law

according perfectly with experimental data, in (4) and yielded

hδE2i = kT 2 dρ(ω, T )

.

i ≃ RkT,

If it was possible to understand how to obtain from electrodynamics the similar expression, containing two
terms, then it would be possible to reverse the consideration by substituting (6) into ﬂuctuation-dissipation
relation

and after determing, also from electrodynamics, the resistance factor R, to ﬁnd the Planck radiation law in a
framework of classical physics. Indeed, by using special relativity formulas, Einstein succeeded in calculating R
for simple model of a moving mirror. He also determined that it was possible to obtain the second term of (6)
“on dimentional grounds” from Maxwell’s electrodynamics as a consequence named the “wavelike” term. But
the ﬁrst term gave rise to a real problem.

Einstein, just as the great part of physicists of his time, was fascinated by Boltzmann’s kinetic theory of gases,
and it seemed to him that the most natural interpretation of the term was to imagine the radiation as consisting
of isolated pointlike objects — light quanta, or photons. Therefore, he named the term the “particlelike” term.
Although Einstein himself was the author of this interpretation, he was not absolutely sure about it. In fact, if
we put not the Planck radiation law, but the Rayleigh-Jeans law in (4):

ρ(ω, T ) =

ω2
π2c3

kT
2

,

then we will obtain the second, “wavelike” term of Eq. (6). Analogously, if we put the Wien law in (4):

ω2
π2c3 e
then we will obtain the ﬁrst, “particlelike” term of Eq. (6). Einstein could hardly avoid noting of it, and his
constant attention to the Wien radiation law is the evidence. Suﬃce it to mention his works [2] and [9].

−¯hω/kT ,

ρ(ω, T ) =

(9)

However, as it is well known, Wien’s law was derived by taking into account the Doppler shift of frequency
at reﬂection of radiation from a moving piston. This is quite possible that for ﬁnding the ﬁrst term of Eq. (6)
within a framework of classical electrodynamics it would be suﬃcient to take into account carefully a uniform
motion of a mirror immersed into radiation. That is why Einstein wanted to do the calculations more thoroughly
in order to come to ﬁnal conclusion.

At Salzburg conference of 1909, where Einstein reported the ideas [3], he met Ludwig Hopf, a brilliant math-
ematical physicist, who made his doctoral degree not long before under the direction of Professor Sommerfeld
[7]. As a result of their joint eﬀorts, the famous Einstein-Hopf work [8] appeared. We are going to discuss it
now more thoroughly than in the usual practice [10-13].

II. THE EINSTEIN-HOPF MODEL

In their article Einstein and Hopf returned once again to Planck’s oscillator, but to make it movable, just like
Einstein’s mirror [3,6], they put the oscillator inside of a gas molecule. After works of Planck, not many dared to
apply the energy equipartition theorem to radiation or to particle inner degrees of freedom. However, as Einstein
and Hopf writes, “the applicability of the theorem [to a molecular translational motion] is proved suﬃcientely
by kinetic theory of gases to leave no doubt”. Hence, the authors decided to go along the way, opposite of
Planck’s, and invoked the equipartition law. To do so, they wrote down one version of a ﬂuctuation-dissipation
relation justiﬁed for a particle immersed in a thermal electromagnetic radiation:

2
h∆

i = 2P kT τ,

(10)

where h∆2i — is a mean-square impulse, P — a friction coeﬃcient.The authors calculated those values by using
classical electrodynamics and, therefore, by making use of Planck’s Eq. (3). The substantial diﬀerence is that

2

since an oscillator moves, therefore, the motion equation is no more one-dimensional. Besides, the motion of a
particle relative to an electric ﬁeld brings into existence a magnetic ﬁeld, hence, we must take into account both
ﬁelds. So, if we assume that the dipole oscillator is oriented along the z-axis and the particle is constrained to
move along the x-axis, we can write down the following set of equations:

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

Since the velocity of a particle along the x-axis is small compared to the speed of light c, we can omit the second
term in the right hand side of the ﬁrst equation. By deﬁnition the oscillator vibrates only along the z-axis,
therefore ω1=0. Furthermore, it is in a thermodynamical equilibrium with radiation, therefore, its acceleration
is small, and we can neglect radiation damping force along the x-axis. Then the set of equations (11) goes to

This is the set of equations that were solved by Einstein and Hopf. First, they found z from the ﬁrst equation
and then substituted it in the second equation and reduced it. The friction force appeared to be proportional,
as in the Brownian particle problem, to the velocity of a particle:

where the friction coeﬃcient P is equal to

The mean-square impulse is calculated by squaring the impulse ∆ = m ˙x and averaging by using the properties
of stochastic radiation ﬁeld. The result is

To be precise, we must point out that Einstein and Hopf considered only a resting oscillator for simpliﬁcation
of calculations. However, we are inclining to think that they did the calculation of h∆2i for a moving oscillator,
too. It was typical for manner of Einstein — to calculate all possible, but to present in articles the simplest
necessary derivation, not burdening a consideration with details that give nothing new in principle.

However, all eﬀorts were in vain. They failed to catch the “particlelike” term by this net. More recently
Boyer [14] suspected that the approximations were not suﬃcient to solve the problem, and that full relativistic
transformations of all important values may be necessary. In work [15] Boyer did the entire calculations, but
obtained, however, the result anologous to that of Einstein and Hopf. In the case the “particlelike” term escaped
also. There is nothing for it but to wonder, once again, of the power of intuition that Einstein had.

III. ZERO-POINT ENERGY AND A CONCISE HISTORY OF STOCHASTIC
ELECTRODYNAMICS

Thus, in 1910, the idea of photons became preferable, and since then the Einstein-Hopf work has been
considered as a turning point in formation of the new quantum theory. However, two years passed, Planck
introduced the “zero-point” energy into physics [16], and in a new Einstein’s work (with Otto Stern) [17]
the “particlelike” term was interpreted in a diﬀerent fashion as a term connected with the zero-point energy.
Thereby, at last, the Planck radiation law was derived within a framework of classical physics. Afterwards,
Einstein abandoned such interpretation of the radiation law [18], speciﬁcally, because of lack of a reasonable
explanation for a factor 2, arising therewith.

In his profound scientiﬁc-historical research [19] Milonni shows that a resolution of this factor of 2 discrepancy
is not taking into account by Einstein and Stern the zero-point energy of electromagnetic radiation, in spite of
their considering the zero-point energy of the oscillator. If the calculations are done correctly, in the mean-square
impulse one more, additional term arises:

i = ¯hωρ +

It was clear from the very beginning to Timothy Boyer in his ﬁrst work devoted to the blackbody radiation law
[20]. He ascribed this term to the eﬀect of a particle interaction with cavity walls. If some part of an oscillator
energy, regardless of temperature, is lost all the time, due to transferring it to walls, it could be possible to
account the balance of energy between the oscillator and the radiation correctly. By combining thermal and
zero-point ﬁelds ρ = ρT + ρ0, Boyer was able to write down the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation as

Thus, the old problem was presented in a new fashion.

But even if we do not give due attention to the Boyer work, it is necessary to mention that in 60’s it was a
revival, Second Coming of Planck’s idea about the zero-point energy. Beginning with fundamental works of T.
W. Marshall [21-23] the idea of zero-point radiation was used to explain eﬀects of diamagnetism, paramagnetism,
Van der Waals forces. The Casimir force [24,24], the Lamb shift [26-28] were explained, the connection between
a behavior of classical and quantum oscillator was found [21,29]. It gave, at last, an insight into the stability of
matter [30,31]. The attempts were made to study Comptom eﬀect [32], spin [33] and hydrogen atom [34] from
the standpoint of classical physics. It is easy to feel the euforia of protogonists of zero-point radiation ﬁeld, so
called “stochastic electrodynamics” (SED), when reading Boyer’s review [30] of 1975. It is also important to
say that these events were going against a background of appearance and development of conjugate with SED
Nelson’s stochastic mechanics [35-37] in which the Schrodinger equation was derived, as it seemed then, from
classical mechanics.

However, after some time, the excitment went down.

In thermodynamic balance equation the Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution for particles led inevitably to the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution for a ﬁeld. In “classical”
derivations of Planck’s radiation law [20,38-40] irreparable loopholes were found [41,42]. Speciﬁcally, in the
mentioned before ﬁrst Boyer’s derivation [20], the blackbody radiation should inevitably have a spatial inho-
mogenuity, i.e., wall eﬀects. But they were not observed in experiments [43]. Moreover, at the absence of
surrounding walls, the equations led, as it turned out, to inevitable conclusion: the zero-point radiation will
eventually bring the particles to high velocities, ever closer to the speed of light! It is most obvious for the
case of absolute zero temperature. Indeed, in the case a particle absorbs energy from zero-point radiation all
the time, and a friction is absent completely. Only a few could accept the conclusion as a really existing and
tried to ﬁnd experimental evidences for it, in particular, in velocity distribution of primary cosmic rays [44,45].
Others defended persistently the importance of interaction with walls [46]. For us, however, it is not clear why
a free particle radiates at the moment of contact with a wall, while wall molecules at the time only absorb.
If we have, for example, two elastically colliding electrons, then ﬁrst accelerates in one direction and second
in opposite direction. It seems obvious that the electromagnetic ﬁelds of these electrons should be combined
together and compensate each other.

IV. NEW SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM

Such indeﬁnite status SED had for rather long time. On the one hand, its methods have found applications
in new areas of researches such as gravitation theory [47], inertial mass theory [48-50] or in an explanation
of a nature of the de Broglie wave [51-53]. On the other hand, it seemed impossible to ﬁnd a connection
between Maxwell’s distribution for particles and Planck’s distribution for a ﬁeld. However, as it seems to the
author of the present paper, after the historic-critical investigation above, there is an obvious opportunity of
one more attempt to get rid of the internal contradictions in SED now. This possibility was founded as early
as in the Einstein-Hopf work. The point is that the Eqs. (11) describes not an interaction of radiation with an
oscillator as a whole, but an interaction of radiation with a charge e! And the charge inside of the oscillator is
accelerated relative to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Moreover, for example, the acceleration of electron in classical
hydrogen atom is very great, about 1025cm/c2. It is diﬃcult to believe that such huge accelerations do not
give any sensible physical eﬀects. Therefore, it would be more correct to solve the set of equations (12) by
taking into account an accelerating motion relative to electric and magnetic stochastic ﬁelds, also, not only a
uniform motion or a rest state, as it was made by Einstein and Hopf. Let us notice, in addition, that a charge
in a harmonic potential is uniformly accelerated with the acceleration a = ω2
0r0. Hence, for the further study

4

of the problem we can use the same mathematical technique that was made for explanation of Unruh-Devies
eﬀect in a framework of SED [54,55], i.e. the appearance of additional thermal radiation around the observer
accelerating in zero-point radiation. Moreover, in work [48] the necessary for us calculations of average force
hF i have already been done, however, for the case of presence zero-point radiation only. Therefore, it is possible
for us not to overload the paper with long calculations (and their complexity may understand everyone who is
familiar with the work [48]), but we may take advantage of its results to do a simple estimation, showing that
the occurence of the second term in the left hand side of Eq. (17) is not only possible, but quite natural.

So, the authors of the article [48] generalized the Einstein-Hopf model for the case of uniformly accelerating

particle motion and neglected a thermal radiation. As a result, instead of Eq. (13) they yielded

¯hω2
0
2πc2 Γa = mia.
The quantity mi was interpreted by Haisch, Rueda and Puthoﬀ as a real, observable inertial mass in distintion
to m of Eqs. (12), which is not observable in experiments.

hF i =

(19)

If we assume that the equation (19) is correct, taking into account the impact of thermal radiation, we will

obtain for average force the following expression:

Where ρ0 = ¯hω3/2π2c3 is the density of the zero-point radiation.

Analogously, if we take a uniformly accelerated motion into account, the mean-square impulse will have one

more, additional term, and it will be proportional to quantity

(cid:19)
The second term of Boyer’s equation (17) has exactly such a dependence on Γ, ¯h and ω0. As for the minus sign
before the term, it follows from physical considerations. An accelerating particle has an additional thermal ﬁeld
around it (from its viewpoint), i.e., the resistance to the motion increases. But this eﬀect may be imaginary,
existing only for the particle. From the point of view of an external observer, the particle may lack the energy
from the radiation. From energetic balance reasoning it is equivalent. And since in Eq. (10) only P is taken
into account, and mi is absent, we may consider that the basic diﬃculties are removed.

V. CONCLUSION

History of modern physics demonstrates that any great work is dialectical by its essence.

If it aﬀected
physicists once, early or late denying its conclusions will again inﬂame the scientiﬁc community. The Einstein-
Hopf work in a time of its appearance clearly demonstrated the necessity of abandoning classical physics and
the importance of quantum ideas. Concepts of photons and wave-particle duality became a part of annals of
physics. Nevertheless, this was the Einstein-Hopf work that included the mathematical technique which became
a foundation of stochastic electrodynamics — the classical theory that explains all quantum phenomena by
making use of idea of classical zero-point radiation. In 1969 T. H. Boyer demonstrated how to derive Planck’s
radiation law within a framework of classical physics. Thus, the problem that Einstein and Hopf were not able
to manage was solved. Unfortunately, one Boyer’s assumption about radiation of particles at the time of their
hitting the walls eventually turned out to be inconsistent. Therefore, the vital question of SED was to oﬀer
an alternative mechanism of energy balance between particles and blackbody radiation. In the present work
such mechanism is proposed. It is an account of accelerating (relative to radiation) motion of charges inside
particles. In the case an additional term appears in the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation, which coincides with
the term in Boyer’s equation, attributed earlier to the cavity walls eﬀect. Thus, one the basic contradictions of
SED is resolved and a new way for its further development is found.

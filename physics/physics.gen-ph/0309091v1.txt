ON DIRAC’S MAGNETIC MONOPOLE

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. The electric charge of the quantization condition of Dirac’s
monopole may have any value, we are not obliged to identify it with the
electron charge. Consequently the magnetic charge of the monopole is
quite arbitrary: Dirac’s monopole is a mere object of science ﬁction.

Too many papers have been written on Dirac’s monopole. In recent years,
Dirac’s treatment has been reformulated with the language of diﬀerential
geometry. However, the fundamental papers remain those of Dirac [1] and
Fierz [2].
In 1987 I have investigated, with a quick, but conceptually ri-
gorous method, the following signiﬁcant instance: the motion of a charged
particle in the external magnetic ﬁeld of a ﬁxed monopole [3]. This treat-
ment allows to derive the celebrated Dirac’s quantization condition avoiding
Dirac’s arbitrary assumption of the single-valuedness of ψ–function. Thus,
my approach – as that of Fierz [2] – is in accord with a basic Pauli’s criterion
[4]; moreover, it makes particularly evident that the electric charge of the
particle may have any value.

Let us consider the motion of a particle, having a given mass M and an
electric charge Q, in the magnetic ﬁeld B(r) = g r/ | r |3 generated by a
ﬁxed monopole, whose magnetic charge is g. (We neglect the action on the
particle of its own e.m. ﬁeld.) If x is the position vector of the particle
with respect to an origin coinciding with the monopole, and Π = M ˙x is its
kinetic momentum, the Hamiltonian H of the problem will be:

where η is the pure number Qg/(~c), commutes with H – i.e. is an integral

of the motion –, and that

The equations of motion of Heisenberg picture are:

R × R = i~R.

where d := ~−1R – and therefore d × d = id. To obtain the quantization

condition, one must solve the following eigenvalue problem:

d2χ = λχ;

now, it is well known from the representation theory of three-dimensional
rotation group [5] that the most general eigensolutions of eq.(14) dependent
only on two parameters (e.g., the polar angles ϑ , ϕ) are:

λ = j(j + 1), with j = 0, 1

of the orthogonal projection of d onto x; accordingly, we have, owing to
eq.(6):

Eq.(16) tells us that

m2 = η,

j ≥ η.

Contrary to a diﬀuse belief, eq.(18) has a poor physical signiﬁcance. In
fact, since the electric charge Q may have any value, the magnetic charge g
of the monopole is quite arbitrary, in particular it may be very small. Dirac
identiﬁed Q with the electron charge e, but this is an unjustiﬁed assumption.
Furthermore, as it was pointed out in 1933 by Bohr and Rosenfeld, macro-
scopic bodies (with large charges and masses) are essential for the physical
interpretation of quantum electrodynamics.

Solutions (15), (16) and (17) are formally identical with the solutions of
the quantal problem of an “inﬁnitely thin” top, having only two, and not
three, degrees of freedom. Such a top “rotates” around its axis x with a
spin ~η, while x precesses around the ﬁxed vector R.

The above treatment, which is manifestly gauge invariant, demonstrates
that the physically correct relation between g and Q is given by eq.(18).
Other quantization conditions can be found in the literature: they are fully
senseless, because they depend both on the mentioned single-valuedness hy-
pothesis of ψ–function and on the number of the singularity lines extending
outward from the particles.

NO MOTIONS OF BODIES PRODUCE GW’S

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. A close comparison between Maxwell ﬁeld and Einstein ﬁeld
makes conceptually and immediately evident that in general relativity
(GR) no motions of bodies can generate gravitational waves (GW’s).

1. – Let us consider a continuous “cloud of dust” characterized by a material
energy tensor ρujuk, (c = 1), (j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3); ρ is the invariant mass density
and uj is the four-velocity. We assume ﬁrst that this “dust” is electrically
charged – with an invariant charge density σ –, and that the gravitational
interaction between its particles is negligible. Thus we have a total mass
tensor T jk given by

T jk = ρujuk + Sjk

,

where Sjk is the energy tensor of Maxwell ﬁeld. Suppose that the spatio-
temporal substrate is a Minkowskian manifold, which is referred to a system
of general co-ordinates x0, x1, x2, x3. If a colon denotes a covariant diﬀeren-
tiation, we have, as it can be formally proved (see sect. A.2 of Appendix
A):

which represent the equations of motion of the charged particles; they are
an analytical consequence of diﬀerential conservation eqs.(2) and of Maxwell
equations (4) and (5). [1].

The theoretical existence of the electromagnetic waves is an analytical

consequence of the above equations, as it is known.

2. – We consider now a “dust”, the particles of which interact only gravi-
tationally; a physical example: the solar system. According to GR we have

of eqs.(6), we have here:

i.e. relations which do not involve explicitly the four-velocity uj. Accor-

dingly, in lieu of eqs.(7), we have the simple geodesic eqs.(11).

3. – For an electrically charged “dust”, the particles of which interact gra-
vitationally (and electromagnetically), we obtain the following equations of
motion:

:j + F kjσuj = 0 ,

NO MOTIONS OF BODIES PRODUCE GW’S

i.e.

four equations which are formally analogous to eqs.(7). Here the
motions are not geodesic. However, no GW can be emitted, for the following
reason.

Assume, for simplicity’s sake only, that ρ vanishes everywhere in space-
time, except for a thin tube of world lines. Suppose further that at a given
time t = t′ the particle P extending over the tube begins to emit GW’s; let
K ′(t′) be the set of kinematical elements (velocity, acceleration, time deriva-
tive of the acceleration, etc.) of P at t = t′. Consider now another “dust”,
identical to the previous one, but such that its charge density σ is equal to
zero, and immerse it in a suitable “external”, “ﬁxed” gravitational ﬁeld. It
is obvious that at some time t′′ particle P will have a set of kinematical ele-
ments, say K ′′(t′′), which is equal to the above K ′(t′). But now the particle
P describes a tube of geodesic lines, and therefore no GW can be emitted.
We see in particular that the current conviction according to which an
accelerated mass sends forth GW’s is false. This belief was originated in the
old times by a partial analogy between Maxwell theory and the linearized
version of GR. [1].

4. – The line of reasoning of previous sect.2. can be extended to the case
of a “dust” characterized by a mass tensor T jk = (µ + p)ujuk + pgjk, where
µ and p are scalars connected by an equation of state µ = ϕ(p) [2]. The
diﬀerential conservation relations of GR

T jk

(14)

:k = 0
give the Eulerian equations of motion of perfect ﬂuid hydrodynamics.
Obviously, the motions of the particles are not geodesic; however, with an
argument similar to that of sect.2. we may conclude that no emission of
GW’s is possible.

5. – In Maxwell theory the divergence of the e.m. energy tensor is zero only
in the absence of charges and currents; in general, it is equal to 4πF jkJk,
cf. eqs.(6). On the contrary, in GR we have the fundamental circumstance
that the divergence of the left-hand side of (8) is always (identically) equal
to zero:

(15)

(Rjk

gjkR):k = 0 ;

−

in the last analysis, the absence of a “mechanism” for the emission of

GW’s can be ascribed to eqs.(15). –

Consider, quite generally, a generic continuous medium; the diﬀerential

conservation equations

(16)

:k = 0
yield – completely or partially – its equations of motion, which in gene-
ral are not geodesic. However, the kinematical elements of these motions
are not diﬀerent from the kinematical elements of purely geodesic motions,

and therefore no GW is sent forth – not even by catastrophic astrophysical
perturbations.

The mass tensor T jk is the sum of a material (stricto sensu) energy tensor
and of the energy tensors of all the ﬁelds, except the metric tensor gjk,
which is the substance of spacetime. This very special character of gjk is
responsible for the fact that the undulatory solutions of Einstein equations
are destitute of a physical reality.

5. – We have seen that, contrary to what occurs in Maxwell theory for the
e.m. waves, in GR no motions of bodies can give origin to GW’s. In my
opinion, the previous considerations are rather stringent. Moreover, their
correctness is indirectly conﬁrmed by various other proofs of the same result
[3]. There are many roads to Rome.

Unfortunately, the astrophysical community is still very far from Caput
mundi, and has entered into a blind alley [4]. Getting rid of current mytho-
logical ideas on GW’s – and BH’s – will be a painful operation.

iii) eqs.(21) have been deduced without using Bianchi relations.

A.2. – Another remarkable fact is the following. Consider the case for which
the gravitational interactions are negligible, and consider a formulation of
SR in arbitrary co-ordinates x0, x1, x2, x3.

The diﬀerential conservation equations for the mass tensor T jk can be

derived in this way: choose, as in A.1., a scalar density

such that

(25)

:k = 0
This means that, contrary to a diﬀuse opinion, also in SR eqs.(25)
are a mere consequence of a simple invariance property of I ′. The merit
of this outcome pertains only to the formulation in general co-ordinates
x0, x1, x2, x3.

.

A.3. – The equations of motion of a considered material continuum can be
derived (completely or partially) from eqs.(22) in GR and from eqs.(25) in
SR.

The nonlinearity of Einstein eqs.(23) has nothing to do with this funda-

mental result – contrary to a widespread belief.

A.4. – A ﬁnal remark.
I have emphasized that eqs.(21) have been here
derived without using Bianchi identities. However, the present deduction
depends on the relativistic dichotomy between the gravitational potential
gjk and the other ﬁelds. Otherwise, in lieu of the two conditions δ*I = 0 and
δ*I ′ = 0, we ought to write the unique (and weaker) condition δ*(I +I ′) = 0.

APPENDIX B

Let us reconsider the case (see sect.1.) of a continuous charged “dust”
– whose particles (of ﬁnite size) interact only electromagnetically –, when
the Minkowskian spacetime is described by the customary metric tensor ηjk
such that: ηrs = 0 for r

= s, η00 = 1, η11 = η22 = η33 =
A pedestrian repetition of the reasoning of sect.1. – with the only sub-
stitution of the ordinary diﬀerentiation for the covariant one – leads us to
conclude that the equations of motion of the charged particles

−

1.

(26)

ρujuk

,j + F kjσuj = 0

are a mere consequence of the deﬁnition of the mass tensor T jk [eqs.(1)]
and of Maxwell ﬁeld equations. This result is generally ignored in the trea-
tises dealing the electromagnetic theory. On the contrary, in the standard
formulations of Maxwell electrodynamics it is aﬃrmed that the law of mo-
tion of the charges is independent of the ﬁeld equations.

It is interesting that both in GR and in SR the equations of motion of
any material continuum are only analytical consequences of the deﬁnition
of the mass tensor T jk and of Einstein and/or Maxwell ﬁeld equations.

Parergon

The searchers of GW’s and of BH’s have entered into a cul-de-sac, owing
to their reluctance to abandon erroneous loci communes concerning the real
physical meaning of GR. A conceptually inadequate “Vulgate”, based on
second-hand works, has got the upper hand. The papers quoted in [4] are
an example of this situation. (Stat pro ratione libido).

From the “Conclusions” of the ﬁrst paper in [4]: “Two diﬀerent astro-
physical searches were performed: an all-sky search aimed at signals from
isolated neutron stars and an orbital parameter search aimed at signals from
the neutron star in the binary system ScoX-1. Both searches also cover a
wide range of possible emission frequencies: a 568.8 Hz band for the isolated
pulsar search and two 20-Hz bands for the ScoX-1 search. – The sensitivity
of these analyses makes the detection of a signal extremely unlikely. As
a consequence the main goal of the paper is to demonstrate an analysis
method using real data [. . . ]” (An implicit admission of another ﬁasco).

From p.54 of the second paper in [4]: “The coalescence of two relativi-
stic stars (double neutron star or black hole/neutron star binary mergers)
is the end result of 0.1-1 Gyr of orbital decay caused by the emission of
gravitational waves. This paroxysmal event should also give rise to a black
hole surrounded by a torus of matter at nuclear densities, possibly produ-
cing relativistic jets that are less energetic and shorter lived than those of
collapsars and originating short GRBs.” (A report from the dream-land: a
bundle of unfounded conjectures).

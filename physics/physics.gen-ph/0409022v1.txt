Critical dimension of Spectral Triples

Alejandro RIVERO ∗†

February 2, 2008

Abstract

It is open the possibility of imposing requisites to the quantisa-
tion of Spectral Triples in such a way that a critical dimension D=26
appears.

From [1] it is known that commutative spectral triples contain the Ein-
stein Hilbert action, which is extracted by using the Wodziski residue over
D/ −2|D/ |n, being D/ a Dirac operator.

The theorem was initially enunciated [1] with a complicated proportion-

ality factor,

and initial proofs where given independently by Kastler, and by Kalau and
Walze. There it was already noticed that the normalisation of the residue was
somehow arbitrary. Actually, the factor in the previous expression contains
three elements:

-a volume Ωn of the n-dimensional sphere
-the dimension 2[n/2] of the ﬁber of the Dirac operator.
-an extant term n−2
Further development of the theory has driven to include the two ﬁrst el-
ements in the normalisation of the residue, so that the deﬁnition coincides
with the generic integral over a non commutative manifold. Besides, modern

proofs of the theorem get the extra factor in a very independent way: dur-
ing a expansion of the spectral density kernel, it comes [5, eq. 8.12]from a
coeﬃcient n−2
4r.
Thus the right normalised form of the fundamental theorem for commu-
tative spectral triples has evolved to show explicitly the extra factor. For
instance already [4, pg. 33] enounces

(the minus sign still there is due to Euclidean Gravity, which is the usual
formulation in the context of non commutative geometry) The change in
normalisation can be traced back to [2, Th. 11.2], in a book which is to NCG
theory as Polchinski’s is to string theory.

Coming naturally from the mathematical development, it seems that no-
body has raised any issue about this extant factor. But it is evident that
if we require it to be equal to one, we are imposing space time dimension
n=26, an amusing coincidence. Now, is there some situation where the ex-
tant factor can be required to be unity? Surely some diﬀerent ways can be
found to impose this requeriment, as it happened during the evolution of
string theory.

Our ﬁrst suggestion is that a perturbative quantisation of the action given
by the normalised trace of the spectral triple will accumulate powers of this
term, so it will coincide with perturbative quantisation of gravity only when
the factor is 1. Thus we claim that a perturbative quantisation of commuta-
tive spectral triples gives gravity only if the dimension of the triple is n=26.
At the moment we have not argument to tell that quantisation in other
number of dimensions is inconsistent. This is slightly diﬀerent from the
proofs in string theory, where consistency implies gravity and at the same
time consistency requires 26 dimensions.

Nature has given us, up to today, sort of 24 degrees of freedom: 12 ele-
mentary fermions and 12 gauge bosons-. Bosonic strings have, of course, 24
transverse directions, but no fermions. Heterotic strings have a narrow miss
trying to score this target, but model builders opt towards a not straight-
forward implementation of the Standard Model spectrum. Having another
theory with criticality at D=26 could guide us towards the M[issing] theory.
Let us point out that in NCG the Higgses are very coordinate-like, so perhaps

2

they can be counted jointly with space-time coordinates in order to partner
the fermions.

The intriguing point in taking a NCG approach is that we are not us-
ing any tool from string theory. Thus we confront two alternatives: either
the existence of a critical dimension D=26 is a phenomena independent of
string theory, or commutative spectral triples can be obtained as a limit of
bosonic strings. This second possibility is very interesting because it reopens
the door of directly studying [bosonic?] strings in the context of noncom-
mutative spectral triples. Formulation of spectral triples associated to string
interactions had already been done in the past, before the ﬂood of papers on
non commutativity. Check [3] for an instance.

In is tempting to speculate if and how could the almost commutative
limit of a concrete string theory give not only the justiﬁcation of the critical
factor, but also the 0-dim part of an almost commutative spectral triple, ie
the Connes-Lott model.

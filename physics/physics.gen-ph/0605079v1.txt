We wish to suggest an algorithm for biological search including DNA search. Our argument

supposes that biological search be performed by quantum search.If we assume this, we can naturally

answer the following long lasting puzzles such that ”Why does DNA use the helix structure?” and

”How can the evolution in biological system occur?”.

We wish to suggest an algorithm for biological search including DNA search. This algorithm has novel features

which are considerable biological interest. Algorithms for biological search have already been proposed by several

groups. One of them, based on quantum search [1], is specially noteworthy because it could explain the magic

numbers such as 4(number of codon), 10(number of tRNA), 20(number of amino acid) etc, which appear in biological

systems[2]. Even though Patel could explain the magic number by quantum search argument, he failed to give the

detailed mechanism for biological search by quantum search.

We wish to put forward a radically diﬀerent mechanism for biological search. Our argument supposes that biological

search be performed by quantum search.If we assume this, we can naturally answer the following two long lasting

puzzles such that ”Why does DNA use the helix structure” and ”How can the evolution in biological system occur?”.

Our argument starts with quantum search hamiltonian given by[3]

H = E(|wihw| + |ψihψ|) + ǫ(eiφ|wihψ| + e−iφ|ψihw|)

(1)

Here ǫ(≤ E) is a constant in unit of energy and φ is a phase.We use |wi and |ψi to denote the target and the

initial states, respectively.The merit of above Hamiltonian is that when the unitary operation e−iHt(we put ~ = 1

throughout) applies to the states, the initial state moves to the target one.

If we ﬁx the phase φ = 0, then the hamiltonian becomes

H = E(|wihw| + |ψihψ|) + ǫ(|wihψ| + |ψihw|)

Suppose that the target state |wi might get the phase eiη|wi(|wi → eiη|wi). Then the Hamiltonian becomes

H = E(|wihw| + |ψihψ|) + ǫ(eiη|wihψ| + e−iη|ψihw|)

When the phase η is not nπ, by the analysis of the above hamiltonian (3), the probability to ﬁnd target by unitary

evolution will not be 1[4]. This implies that the phase η is important role in biological search. Here we can ask how

the biological system can get the phase η. In DNA, the natural way to get the phase is to take the helix structure.

When DNA moves through the helix structure, the target state naturally gets the phase. If it is true, we can check

this argument by an experiment that if the phase of DNA can be changed, the DNA will not couple with A and T or

C and G with a small possibility. And it might be one of the reason of errors in DNA reproduction.

Another suprising feaure is that when the phase η is not nπ, there might be a speedup in searching the target[4]. That

is, when the phase η is not nπ and satisﬁes some condition, even though the biological system cannot ﬁnd the target

with perferction, the searching ability becomes stronger than when the phase η is nπ. The fact that the searching

ability improves means that the biological system can ﬁt more suitably the changing environment. This ability can

explain naturally how the biological system could evolve through the years. In other words, we might say that the

small errors in quantum system can cause biological evolution.

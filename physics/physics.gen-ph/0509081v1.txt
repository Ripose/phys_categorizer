Abstract

The inversion of an FIR data sampling is usually stated to be possible with the use of a
potentially unstable IIR, and in particular circumstances. It is possible to accomplish
the same inversion with the doubling of an FIR sampling and with only FIRs for the
sampling and the inversion. This note presents the conﬁguration, which appently is
not in the literature, for perfect signal reconstruction.

The sampling of information with FIR ﬁlters is very common [1]. The signal
reconstruction of a data stream sampled with these ﬁlters is typically not analyzed
in a simple manner, and the invocation of a potentially unstable IIR ﬁlter bank is
utilized. It is commonly stated that the inversion of a signal with only FIRs is not
possible. This is not the case, and in this note a signal reconstruction is presented
that performs this task without loss of information.

A digital data stream is denoted by X(n), and a k-tap ﬁltering is performed with

the transform,

Y (n) =

biX(n − i) .

The coeﬃcients bk are real for a real data stream, but the duplication of the process
can be performed with complex coeﬃcients ck. In the latter scenario, the real data
stream X(n) is used and the real part of Y (n) is taken, i.e. the FIR ﬁltering is identical
to taking Re Y (n) with the real parts of the complex coeﬃcients Re ck = bk.

The duplication of the FIR ﬁltering is not required in general. However, with
this process of using complex coeﬃcients ck, an perfect reconstruction of the ﬁltered
signal Y (n) can be achieved with using an additional complex FIR, with suitably
chosen taps. The use of an IIR is not required.

The double process of the two FIR ﬁlterings results in the signal,

Z(n) =

dkckX(n − i − j) .

Choosing the complex coeﬃcients dk appropriately results in Z(n) = X(n).

Consider the example of a 4-tap ﬁlter. The reconstruction appears with the

following formulae,

c0d0 = ρ + iα1
c1d0 + c0d1 = iα2
c1d1 + c0d2 + c2d0 = iα3
c2d1 + c1d2 + c3d0 + c0d3 = iα4
c2d2 + c3d1 + c1d3 = iα5
c3d2 + c2d3 = iα6

c3d3 = iα7 .

In general these equations are not invertible for real inputs ci and di, and with αj = 0.
Taking these taps to be complex, and with αi arbitrary, allows for a general solution.
Then the signal Re Z(n) = X(n).

The case of a DFT is known, pertaining to |ci| = 1, that is, with coeﬃcients on
the unit circle. More general ﬁltering requires these coeﬃcients to be anywhere in the
complex plane.

The requirements to invert a real signal are then Re ci = bi and the solution to
the general system in (3). The coeﬃcients αi can be anything, and ρ is a parameter
than may rescale the output. The system in (3) has seven complex equations, in
which only six real components are non-trivial as the αi are a priori free parameters
(they can be chosen to solve the system of equations). There are only four inputs,
the bi. There are twelve real unknowns Im ci and di.

The conditions in (3) form a matrix equation,

The inversion of the algebraic system generates the complex di parameters and the
imaginary components of ci (the bi). For example, Matlab can used to invert the
non-square matrix, followed by the multiplication with a vector of αi entries and
solve for the di. In general the αi are non-vanishing; a set of zero entries gives zero
values for the di taps. The 7 equations modeling the real components of (4) can be
written in a 8x8 form with the real and imaginary components of d = dr + idi. This
system is complete (7 equations in eight variables) and can be used to solve for the
four di in terms of the complex components of ci. The solutions to di are then used
to determine the αi parameters.

This procedure is straigtforward to implement for a general tap ﬁlter, even for
large numbers. The perfect inversion of the FIR ﬁltered signal is accomplished without
the use of a potentially unstable IIR on some data, and with perfect reconstruction.

The simple conﬁguration requires the doubling of the input signal into real and imag-
inary parts, with another pair of ﬁlters to reconstruct. The conﬁguration is also more
cost eﬀective than using IIRs.

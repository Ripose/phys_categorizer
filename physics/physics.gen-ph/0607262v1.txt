Abstract

In 1992 M.W. Evans proposed a so-called O(3) symmetry of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds by adding a constant longitudinal ”ghost ﬁeld” to
the well-known transversal plane em waves. He considered this sym-
metry as a new law of electromagnetics. Later on, since 2002, this
O(3) symmetry became the center of his Generally Covariant Uniﬁed
Field Theory which he recently renamed as ECE Theory. One of the
best-checked laws of electrodynamics is the principle of linear super-
position of electromagnetic waves, manifesting itself in interference
phenomena. Its mathematical equivalent is the representation of elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds as vectors. By considering the superposition
of two phase-shifted waves we show that the superposition principle
is incompatible with M.W. Evans’ O(3) hypothesis.

1 M.W. Evans’ O(3) hypothesis
In the following text quotations from M.W. Evans’ GCUFT book [1] ap-
pear with equation labels [1.nn] at the left margin.

The assertion of O(3) symmetry is at the center of M.W. Evans’ con-
siderations since 1992. He claims that each plane circularly-polarized elec-
tromagnetic wave is accompanied by a constant longitudinal ﬁeld B(3), a

so-called ”ghost ﬁeld”. In addition to numerous papers, with far reaching
in [2] and [3], M.W. Evans is author of ﬁve books on
implications as e.g.
”The Enigmatic Photon” dealing with the claimed O(3)-symmetry of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. His hypotheses have met many objections. The reader
will ﬁnd a historical overview written by A. Lakhtakia in [4, Sect.5].

M.W. Evans considers a circularly polarized plane electromagnetic wave
propagating in z-direction, cf. [1, Chap.1.2]. Using the electromagnetic phase

where κ = ω/c, he describes the wave relative to his complex circular basis
[1.41] derived from the cartesian basis vectors i, j, k. The magnetic ﬁeld is
given as

and satisﬁes the ”cyclic O(3) symmetry relations”

Especially equ.[1.43/3] deﬁnes the ”ghost ﬁeld” B(3) which is coupled by

the relations [1.44] with the transversal components B(1) and B(2).

M.W. Evans’ B Cyclic Theorem is the statement that each plane
circularly polarized wave [1.43/1-2] is accompanied by a longitudinal ﬁeld
[1.43/3], and the associated ﬁelds fulﬁl the cyclic equations [1.44]. M.W.
Evans considers this O(3) hypothesis as a Law of Physics.

2 Checking the superposition property of the

O(3) hypothesis

Instead of [1.38] we consider a phase shifted wave with the more general
phase function

Φα(t, z) = ωt

κz + α = Φ(t, z) + α

−

which can be understood as a time shifted wave where the time shift is
t0 :=

α
ω :

We use the phase Φα in [1.43] to obtain the time-shifted magnetic ﬁeld

Φα(t, z) = Φ(t

t0, z).

where we have introduced a coeﬃcient γ that should equal 1 following M.W.
Evans while in classical electrodynamics γ = 0.

Now we consider the wave generated by the superposition of two waves
α, respectively, and α such that cos α < 1.

According to the superposition principle the total ﬁeld is then

Considering the ﬁrst two (transversal) components we recognize that
the superposition yields the original wave [1.43/1-2] multiplied by the fac-
tor 2 cos α. Hence, according to M.W. Evans’ O(3) hypothesis [1.43/3] it
B(0)k with
should be accompanied by a longitudinal component 2γ cos α

γ = 1. The superposition principle, however, yields B(3) = 2γB(0)k (Eq.8).
Since we assumed cos α < 1, this is a contradiction. Only the classical case
γ = 0 is compatible with the superposition principle, and M.W. Evans’
”ghost ﬁeld” cannot exist.

M.W. Evans’ cyclical O(3)-hypothesis is incompatible with

the superposition principle of waves.

Remark without detailed proof: A consequence of this incompatibility is
that for γ
= 0 it is impossible to construct (by Fourier synthesis) localized
packets of circularly polarized waves. The transverse components B(1) and
B(2) have an oscillatory phase in space and time and can therefore be chosen
so as to interfere destructively outside the desired packet. However, according
to eq. (1.43/3), the longitudinal B(3) ﬁeld of each Fourier component is a
constant vector in space and time. By superposing such vectors we can only
obtain another constant vector. The B(3) ﬁeld of a wave packet must either
disappear or ﬁll the whole universe at all times. This ampliﬁes an objection
raised by A. Lakhtakia [6] already in 1995.

Abstract

Hydrodynamic equations for ideal incompressible ﬂuid are written in terms
of Clebsch potentials. Two-dimensional version of these equations is trans-
formed to the form of one dynamic equation for the stream function. This
contains arbitrary function which is determined by inﬂow conditions given on
the boundary. To determine unique solution, velocity and vorticity (but not
only velocity itself) must be given on the boundary. This unexpected cir-
cumstance may be interpreted in the sense that the ﬂuid has more degrees of
freedom, than it was believed. Besides, the vorticity is less observable quan-
tity as compared with the velocity. It is shown that the dynamic equation for
incompressible ﬂuid do not contain time derivatives essentially, and the prob-
lem of nonstationary ﬂow for incompressible ﬂuid is reduced to the problem
of stationary ﬂow with the time as a parameter of boundary conditions.

1 Introduction

In this paper we write hydrodynamic equations for ideal ﬂuid in terms of Clebsch
potentials [1, 2]. This representation admits one to integrate hydrodynamic equa-
tions. We use this representation and possibility of integration for investigation of
the two-dimensional ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid. In this case one of Clebsch poten-
tials may coincide with the stream function. The obtained form of hydrodynamic
equations is a generalization of the irrotational ﬂow described by the equation for
stream function ψ

ψxx + ψyy = 0

(1.1)

on the case of rotational non-stationary ﬂow of ideal incompressible ﬂuid. The ob-
tained equation distinguishes from (1.1) in additional terms, containing the function
ψ.

It is a common practice to think that the problem of streamline ﬂow can be

solved by consideration of only Euler system of equations

where p is the pressure, and E = E(ρ, S) is the internal energy of an unite mass
considered to be a function of ρ and S. The internal energy E = E(ρ, S) is an
unique characteristic of the ideal ﬂuid.

The system of hydrodynamic equations (1.2)–(1.4) is a closed system of diﬀeren-
tial equations. It is common practice to think that it has an unique solution inside
some space-time region Ω, provided dependent dynamic variables ρ, v = {v1, v2, v3},
S are given as functions of three arguments on the space-time boundary Γ of the re-
gion Ω. Being closed, the system (1.2)–(1.4) describes nevertheless only momentum-
energetic characteristics of the ﬂuid. Motion of the ﬂuid particles along trajectories
in the given velocity ﬁeld v is described by so called Lin constraints [3]

where the labels ξ = ξ(t, x) = {ξα(t, x)}, α = 1, 2, 3 of ﬂuid particles are considered
to be functions of independent variables t, x. If the equations (1.5) have been solved,
and ξ has been determined as a function of (t, x), the ﬁnite relations

describe implicitly a ﬂuid particle trajectory and a motion along it.

The system of eight equations (1.2) –(1.5) forms a complete system of dynamic
equations describing a ﬂuid, whereas the system of ﬁve equations (1.2)–(1.4) forms

a curtailed system of dynamic equations. The last system is closed, but to be a
complete system, it must be supplemented by the kinematic equations

dx
dt

= v(t, x),

x = x(t, ξ)

(1.7)

where v(t, x) is a solution of the system (1.2)-(1.4). Three equations (1.7) are
equivalent to (1.5), because any solution ξ = ξ(t, x) of (1.5) is a set of three integrals
of equations (1.7).

Conventionally the Eulerian system (1.2)–(1.4) is considered as a starting point
for a description of the ideal ﬂuid. There is a lack of understanding of the fact
that the Eulerian system (1.2)–(1.4) is a curtailed one and that the equations (1.5)
describe a motion of ﬂuid particles.

Using the fact that the relabeling group

ξα → ˜ξα = ˜ξα(ξ),

D ≡ det k ∂ ˜ξα/∂ξβ k6= 0,

α, β = 1, 2, 3

(1.8)

is a symmetry group of the dynamic system, and the system of equations (1.2) –
(1.5) is invariant with respect to the relabeling group, one can integrate the complete
system of dynamic equations (1.2) – (1.5) in the form [4]

S(t, x) = S0(ξ)

where S0(ξ), ρ0(ξ) and g(ξ) = {gα(ξ)}, α = 1, 2, 3 are arbitrary integration functions
of argument ξ, and ϕ, η are new dependent variables satisfying dynamic equations

If ﬁve dependent variables ϕ, ξ, η satisfy the system of equations (1.5), (1.12),
(1.13), ﬁve dynamic variables S, ρ, v (1.9)–(1.11) satisfy dynamic equations (1.2)–
(1.4). Indeﬁnite functions S0(ξ), ρ0(ξ), and gα(ξ) can be determined from initial
and boundary conditions in such a way that the initial and boundary conditions for
variables ϕ, ξ, η were universal in the sense that they do not depend on the ﬂuid
ﬂow [4]. The dependent variables ξ, known as Clebsch potentials [1, 2] are hydrody-
namic potentials, which play the same role in hydrodynamics as the electromagnetic
potentials Ai do in electrodynamics.

System of equations (1.5), (1.12), (1.13) can be obtained from the variational

principle [4] with the action functional

Ag[ρ, j, ξ, η, S] =

− ρE − jk[∂kϕ + gα(ξ)∂kξα − η∂kS]}dtdx

where jk = {j0, j} = {ρ, j} is the ﬂuid ﬂux, and velocity v in equations (1.5), (1.10),
(1.12), (1.13) is connected with j by means of relation j = ρv. A summation is
produced over repeating Latin indices (0 − 3) and repeating Greek indices (1 − 3).
Quantities gα(ξ) are considered as ﬁxed functions of ξ. They are determined from
initial conditions.

In the special case of incompressible ﬂuid, it should set ρ = ρ0 =const in the

action (1.14) and introduce new variables

v = j/ρ0,

ρ0 = const

(1.15)

It is easy to verify that η = η(ξ), S = S0(ξ), and the last term of (1.14) can be
incorporated with the term jkgα(ξ)∂kξα. Thus, the action for the incompressible
ﬂuid looks as follows

one obtains

where Ωαβ is deﬁned by (1.19). It follows from (1.17)

v×(∇ × v) = Ωαβ(ξ)∇ξβ(v∇)ξα.

In virtue of (1.18) the last term in rhs of (1.25) coincides with rhs of (1.26). Then

Here the pressure p is determined after solution of the system of hydrodynamic

Note that the conventional form (1.24) of hydrodynamic equations is obtained
from the hydrodynamic equations (1.17)-(1.20) by means of diﬀerentiation. It means
that the form of hydrodynamic equations (1.17)-(1.20) is a result of integration
of hydrodynamic equations (1.24) together with the Lin constraints (1.6).
It is
interesting also that the system of equations (1.17)-(1.20) contains time derivatives
only in the Lin constraints (1.18).

2 Two-dimensional ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid

Although it is possible to deal with equations (1.17) – (1.20) for incompressible
ﬂuid, we prefer to consider dynamic equations for slightly compressible ﬂuid, whose
internal energy has the form

Without loss of generality we can assume that ξ2 does not depend on the time t

ξ2 = ξ2 (x, y)

(2.10)

Indeed, variables ξ1, ξ2 label particles of the ﬂuid, and we may change the form of
labeling, using transformation (1.8). Let

˜ξ1 = ˜ξ1 (t, x, y) ,

˜ξ2 = ˜ξ2 (t, x, y)

(2.11)

and ˜ξ1 depends on t essentially

(2.14)

it is easy to verify directly that expressions (2.12) for ξ1,, ξ2 with ˜ξ1 = C1 =const are
also solutions of (2.13). It means that (2.10) may be used instead of (2.11) without
a loss of generality.

one obtains

ξ2 (x, F2 (x, C2)) = C2

dynamic equation only as a parameter describing evolution of the Clebsch potential

ideal incompressible ﬂuid.

Remark. Equation (2.26) can be obtained by direct integration of Euler equations
for two-dimensional ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid. Indeed, eliminating pressure from
equations (1.24), we obtain

conservative quantity in the sense that the vector ωv = {ωu, ωv} is conserved

In this case the vorticity ω looks as a

∂1 (ωu) + ∂2 (ωv) = ∂1 (−Ω (ψ) ψ,2) + ∂2 (Ω (ψ) ψ,1) ≡ 0

(2.35)

This fact may be regarded in the sense that the vorticity ω describes some internal
property of ﬂuid particles. The value of vorticity ω is connected with the intensity of
excitation of some internal degree of freedom. This degree of freedom is a rotation
In general, if the velocity ﬁeld v (x) is given, the vorticity
of the ﬂuid particle.
ﬁeld ω is determined uniquely as a result of diﬀerentiation of v (x). But giving v
on the boundary, we do not determine vorticity, because the velocity ﬁeld given on
the boundary can be diﬀerentiated only along the boundary, whereas the normal
derivative of velocity is not determined. It is to be given in addition.

In the case of arbitrary ﬂow the equation (2.33) is reduced to the form

Solution of (2.36) can be presented in the form

dω

ω = ψ,11 + ψ,22 = Ω (ξ1, ξ2)

(2.36)

(2.37)

where ξ1 and ξ2 are two independent solutions of equation (2.36), i.e. ξ1 and ξ2
are Clebsch potentials, satisfying equations (1.5). Thus, the problem of the Euler
system integration appears to be connected with consideration of the Lin constraints.
The statement that we can investigate the ﬂuid motion, considering only the Euler
system of dynamic equations and ignoring completely Lin constraints, is only an
illusion.

The function Ω (ξ1, ξ2) is determined from the inﬂow conditions on the boundary
of the considered ﬂow. The dynamic equation (2.37) appears to contain information
on boundary conditions. It means that,studying rotational nonstationary ﬂows, a
separate investigation of dynamic equations and boundary conditions becomes to

9

be impossible. Appearance of several indeﬁnite functions of ψ in dynamic equations
of type (2.34) for stationary rotational ﬂow is well known (see, for instance, survey
[6]). Unfortunately, sometimes investigation of these functions origin is absent.

Obtaining the basic equation (2.26), we used properties of Clebsch potentials,
described by equations (2.4). These relations contain arbitrary functions gα (ξ),
which describe inﬂuence of boundary conditions on the form of dynamic equations.
Indeﬁnite functions gα (ξ) describe general properties of ideal ﬂuid, which could be
applied not only for investigation of incompressible ﬂuid. Information contained in
three functions ga (ξ) of three arguments ξ1, ξ2, ξ3 is much more, than information
contained in one function Ω (ξ1, ξ2) of two arguments. Maybe, not all this informa-
tion is essential, but some part of this information is essential for sure. It is the
reason why we investigate dynamic equations (1.17) –(1.20), but not Euler system
(2.31), which contain this information only in implicit form.

The last shorter derivation (2.31) – (2.37) of equation (2.37) ignores general
relations (2.4), but nevertheless ﬁnally it leads to (2.37), i.e. to a description in
terms of Clebsch potentials.

3 Inﬂow conditions for stationary ﬂow

Let us suppose that the stationary inﬂow conditions are given at the plane Sin :
x = −L =const. In the stationary case stream function ψ does not depend on time
t. One may set in (2.26) C0 (t, ξ2) = C0 (ξ2). On the inﬂow surface we choose the
function ξ2 in the form

According to (2.22) (2.21) the inﬂow conditions have the form

and W (y) are supposed to be known functions determining inﬂow conditions of the
ﬂuid. We obtain from (3.2) and (2.27)

Thus, inﬂow conditions (3.2), (3.3) admit one to determine indeﬁnite functions
Ω12 and C1. It is interesting, that inﬂow conditions are given at the inﬂow surface
Sin : x = −L by the velocity component u and by derivative ∂v/∂x (normal to Sin)
of the component v (but not by the component v itself). Information, giving by
the velocity component v on the inﬂow surface Sin, is insuﬃcient for determination
of indeﬁnite functions Ω12 and C1. The derivative ∂v/∂x together with ∂u/∂y
determine vorticity. As we have remarked in the end of the second section, the
derivative ∂u/∂y can be calculated, if the velocity u is given on the inﬂow surface,
whereas ∂v/∂x cannot. To determine vorticity, we need to give ∂v/∂x on the inﬂow
surface, whereas the tangent component v appears to be unnecessary for the vorticity
determination.

4 Problem of stationary ﬂow over obstacle

Let us consider a ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid inside the space region V bounded by
two walls S1 : y = −R =const, S2 : y = R, by inﬂow surface Sin : x = −L =const,
by outﬂow surface Sout : x = L, and by the surface Sob of some obstacle, placed
in vicinity of the coordinate origin. The shape of the obstacle is determined by the
relation

The boundary conditions are formulated as follows.

Sob : Σob (x, y) = 0

S1 : ψ (x, −R) = ψ1 = const,

S2 : ψ (x, R) = ψ2 = const

Sob : ψ (x, R) = ψob = const

Constants ψ1 and ψ2 are connected by the relation

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

ψ2 − ψ1 = −

Vx (y) dy

Conditions (4.2) mean that the normal velocity component vanishes on all walls.
Value of ψob describes a circulation around the obstacle, because ψob − ψ1 describes
the mean value of ﬂux between S1 and Sob. For instance, if ψob = ψ1, the circulation
around the obstacle is such, that the ﬂuid ﬂows only between S2 and Sob

Boundary condition on the inﬂow surface Sin has the form

where the velocity component Vx (y) is supposed to be given. The boundary condi-
tion on the outﬂow surface Sout has the form

Sout : ψ (L, y) = ψout (y) ,

ψout (−R) = ψ1,

ψout (R) = ψ2

(4.5)

where ψout (y) is some given function. It describes the velocity distribution on the
outﬂow surface. To understand, why such a distribution should be given, and why it
is not determined by the inﬂow condition, let us imagine that outside the volume V
in vicinity of Sout there are some obstacles. Distribution of velocity on Sout depends
on size, shape and displacement of these obstacles. Description of these obstacles is
carried out by ψout (y).

Let us consider a ﬂow over the obstacle and rewrite dynamic equation (2.26) in

the form

Lψ = Ω (ψ)
Lψ = ∇2ψ = ψ,11 + ψ,22
Ω (ψ) = −ρ0Ω12(ξ2) = −U (ξ2) = −U (Q (ψ))
where the function U is deﬁned as a function of argument y by the relation (3.6)

(4.6)

(4.7)

U (y) =

Function ξ2 = Q (ψ) is deﬁned as a function of argument ψ by the relation

In particular, if Vx (y) = V0 =const, ξ2 = Q (ψ) = (ψ1 − ψ) /V0.

Dynamic equation (4.6) is nonlinear equation, in general. If vorticity Ω is small,
dynamic equation (4.6) can be solved by means of an iteration procedure. To obtain
the zeroth order approximation ψ(0), we consider linear equation

Lψ(0) = ∇2ψ(0) = 0

with boundary conditions (4.2) – (4.5), which is written for brevity in the form

Let us consider stationary slightly rotational ﬂow between two concentric circular
cylinder of radius a and b (a < b). Let us choose the coordinate system with the
z-axis directed along the cylinder axis and coordinate origin on the cylinder axis.
The x-axis is directed along the mean velocity V0 of the ﬂow. Let us introduce polar

6 Nonstationary ﬂow and peculiarities of incom-

pressible ﬂuid

Problem of nonstationary ﬂow of incompressible ideal ﬂuid is reduced to the problem
of stationary ﬂow, where all boundary conditions are considered to be functions of
time t as an additional parameter. The fact is that the dynamic equation for two-
dimensional ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid do not contain time derivative essentially.
Dynamic equation (2.22), and Lin constraints (1.5) in terms of stream function

ψ take the form

(ψ,11 + ψ,22) = −ρ0Ω12(ξ1, ξ2),

ξ1,0 − ψ,2ξ1,1 + ψ,1ξ1,2 = 0
ξ2,0 − ψ,2ξ2,1 + ψ,1ξ2,2 = 0

(6.1)
(6.2)
(6.3)

where the function Ω12 is determined by boundary conditions. We cannot set initial
value of the ﬂuid velocity in arbitrary way. The velocity is determined by the stream
function ψ, which must satisfy dynamic equation (6.1) and cannot be arbitrary at
the initial moment of time. Thus, velocity at the initial moment, as well as in other
time, is determined by boundary conditions at this moment.

One of two independent Clebsch potentials, say ξ2, can be chosen to be indepen-
dent on time. Then the time derivative in (6.3) vanishes and the equation takes the
form

∂ (ψ, ξ2)
∂ (x, y)

= 0,

ψ = ψ (t, ξ2)

(6.4)

where the time t is simply a parameter, determined by the parameter t in boundary
conditions. Clebsch potential ξ1 depends on time always. The fact is that, the

15

Clebsch potentials are not physical quantity, in general. They describe a method of
labelling may depend on time even for stationary ﬂow.

As we have seen in the fourth section, Ω12 depends only on ξ2 (or ψ), if ξ2 does
not depend on t. It does not depend on ξ1, and the ﬂow can be determined on the
base of only equations (6.1), (6.4) and boundary conditions. Equation (6.2) for ξ1,
which contains time derivative, does not used. Equations (6.1), (6.4) do not contain
time derivatives, and the ﬂow does not depend on t, provided boundary conditions
do not depend on t. Dependence of ξ1 on t does not mean that the problem is
not stationary, because Clebsch potentials depend on time, in general, even in the
stationary ﬂow. Formally it follows from (1.5). dependence on t is conditioned by
the fact that Clebsch potentials are not physical quantities. They describe a way of
labelling only.

If boundary conditions depend on t, the time t is considered to be a parameter
(but not as an independent variable). The problem is solved as a stationary prob-
lem for each value of the time t, and set of these ﬂuid ﬂows, depending on t as a
parameter, is a solution of nonstationary ﬂow problem.

From physical viewpoint such a result is quite reasonable, because the sound
speed is inﬁnite in incompressible ﬂuid. Any change of boundary conditions spreads
instantaneously over all ﬂuid. Such a situation, when the boundary conditions
determine uniquely the whole ﬂow, takes place in the stationary ﬂow. Impossibility
of setting arbitrary initial values for the velocity agrees with the dependence on t as
a parameter.

In fact, any real ﬂuid is not an incompressible ﬂuid. Any real ﬂuid is described
by the system of dynamic equations of hyperbolic type, whereas dynamic equation
for incompressible ﬂuid are of elliptic type.
If we consider slightly compressible
ﬂuid, whose state is described by the relation (2.1) with very small ε, we have
dynamic equations with small parameter ε before the temporal derivatives.
It is
system of equations of hyperbolic type. Solutions of such a system are of two
types: (1) smooth solutions of elliptic dynamic equations, which are obtained, when
one sets ε = 0 and remove temporal derivatives, (2) piecewise smooth solutions,
when smooth pieces are connected by rapidly evolving solutions. Rapidly evolving
solutions are conditioned by small parameter ε before the time derivatives. If ε → 0,
the rapidly evolving pieces of solution turn to jumps (shock waves), which cannot be
described in the approximation of incompressible ﬂuid. They should be described
as limits ε → 0 in solutions of dynamic equations for slightly compressible ﬂuid
(2.1). Hyperbolic dynamic equations for the slightly compressible ﬂuid and elliptic
dynamic equations for incompressible ﬂuid have diﬀerent types of boundary and
initial conditions.
In particular, as we have seen, there are no arbitrary initial
conditions for incompressible ﬂuid, because they are determined by the boundary
conditions, and this is valid for three-dimensional ﬂows also.

There exists a technique of working with discontinuous solutions for irrotational
ﬂows of incompressible ﬂuid (consideration of shock waves), but, apparently, such a
technique for rotational ﬂows of incompressible ﬂuid is not yet developed suﬃciently.

8 Discussion

In fact, we have only the theory of irrotational ﬂows.

Theory of irrotational ﬂows has been developed much more, than that of rotational
ﬂows.
In the theory of
rotational ﬂows we have only a set of separate exact solutions [6]. As a result
sometimes arbitrary ﬂuid ﬂows are considered from viewpoint of the irrotational
ﬂow theory.

However, rotational ﬂows have some speciﬁc properties, which absent in the
case of irrotational ﬂows. Vorticity Ωαβ (ξ), deﬁned by (1.19), vanishes identically
for irrotational ﬂows, and dynamic equations (1.18) are satisﬁed identically inde-
pendently of behavior of Clebsch potentials, i.e.
independently of whether or not
dynamic equations (1.22) are fulﬁlled. The fact that the Euler system is the system
of dynamic equation, where Clebsch potentials are eliminated, is of no importance
for the irrotational ﬂow theory.

Vorticity Ωαβ (ξ), as well as any function F (ξ) of Clebsch potentials ξ, is con-

served in the sense that the 4-ﬂux

Ωαβi = Ωαβ (ξ) ji = Ωαβ (ξ)

i = 0, 1, 2, 3,

Ωαβ (ξ)

 

∂J
∂ξ0,i !

= 0,

α, β = 1, 2, 3

(8.1)

identically. The ﬂux Ωαβi = 0 for irrotational ﬂows, and problem of the vorticity
inﬂow through the boundary, as well as boundary conditions for the ﬂow of vorticity
are not considered for irrotational ﬂows. Setting of the velocity and (density for
compressible ﬂuids) on the boundary is suﬃcient for determination of an unique
solution on the set of irrotational ﬂows. Thus, the approach, when one considers the
Euler system (1.24) of dynamic equations and boundary conditions for velocity, is
suﬃcient for determination of an unique solution on the set of irrotational ﬂows. This
approach ignores Clebsch potentials completely, supposing that, if it is necessary,
the Clebsch potentials can be calculated by means of integration of a system of
ordinary diﬀerential equations after determination of the ﬂuid ﬂow.

As far as the theory of rotational ﬂows has been developed slightly, sometimes the
theory of irrotational ﬂow is applied for investigation of rotational ﬂows. Application
of the theory of irrotational ﬂows means that we ignore Clebsch potentials, supposing
that they are not relevant to calculation of the rotational ﬂow, although in reality
vorticity is described in terms of Clebsch potentials rather simply. Application of
the irrotational ﬂow theory means also that we ignore inﬂow of vorticity, which must
be given on the boundary in addition to the boundary condition for velocity. The
fact, that the vorticity is less observable quantity, than the velocity, facilitates such
an ignorance. All this means that we ignore some freedom degrees, connected with
vorticity. In this case we cannot properly investigate strongly vortical (turbulent)
ﬂows, and can only be surprised by their unexpected properties.

18

Can we investigate rotational ﬂows, starting from Euler system of hydrodynamic
equations? Yes, we can, because the Euler system contains full information on the
ﬂuid ﬂow. But, if we search for rotational ﬂows, the ﬁrst integration leads to a
reference to properties of Clebsch potentials, as we have seen in the end of the
second section (relations (2.36), (2.37)). It means that the system of hydrodynamic
equations in terms of Clebsch potential have some advantages as a starting point
for investigation of rotational ﬂows, because some possible integrations have been
already produced there.

Our conclusion, that the problem of nonstationary ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid
is reduced to the problem of stationary ﬂow is based mathematically on properties
of Clebsch potentials. Among three independent Clebsch potential ξ1,ξ2,ξ3
two
of them, say ξ2,ξ3, may be chosen to be independent of time t, and this property
leads to the fact that all essential dynamic equations do not contain time derivative.
Reduction of the nonstationary problem to the stationary one seems rather evident
from physical viewpoint, but proof of this property on the base of only Euler system
of hydrodynamic equations seems rather problematic.

Abstract— A model with ﬂat FRW symmetries and G and Λ, vari-
able is considered in such a way that the momentum-energy tensor
that describes the model is characterized by a bulk viscosity parame-
ter. For this tensor the conservation principle is taken into account.
In this paper it is showed how to apply the dimensional method in
order to solve the outlined equations in a trivial way.

I. Introduction.

Recently several models with FRW metric, where “con-
stants” G and Λ are considered as dependent functions on
time t have been studied. For these models, whose energy-
momentum tensor describes a perfect ﬂuid, it was demon-
strated that G ∝ tα, where α represents a certain positive
constant that depends on the state equation imposed while
Λ ∝ t−2 is independent of the state equation (see [1],[2]).
More recently this type of model was generalized by Arbab
(see [3]) who considers a ﬂuid with bulk viscosity (or sec-
ond viscosity in the nomenclature of Landau (see [4])). The
role played by the viscosity and the consequent dissipative
mechanism in cosmology has been studied by many authors
(see [5]).).

In the models studied by Arbab constants G and Λ are
substituted by scalar functions that depend on time t. The
state equation that governs the bulk viscosity is: ξ ∝ ξ0ργ
where γ is a certain indeterminate constant for the time
being γ ∈ [0, 1].

As we shall see, this problem is already solved, but our
aim is to solve it through Dimensional Analysis. We mean
to point out how an adequate use of this technique let us
ﬁnd the solution of the outlined equations in a trivial way,
even pointing out that it is not necessary to impose the
condition div(Tij ) = 0. The paper is organized as follows:
in the second section the model is showed, expounding the
equations and showing the ingredients that compose the
model. The third section is devoted to revise the solution,
which is reached by means of standard techniques of ODEs
integration (see in special [10]), while in the forth section
the dimensional technique will be developed in order to
solve the model. This section is divided in two subsec-
tions. In the ﬁrst one, titled “pretty simple method”, we
point out how a naive use of D.A. brings us to ﬁnd such

solution in a trivial way. Several cases are also studied here
by Arbab I. Arbab (see [3]), while in the other subsection
a ﬁner dimensional technique is showed. That is why we
call it “not so simple method”. This section is based on
dimensional techniques (groups and symmetries, see [8]),
in order to reduce the number of variables intervening in
the expounded ODEs. They are so simpliﬁed that its inte-
gration is immediate. We think that the technique showed
here is so powerful that it shall be proved that imposing
the condition div(Tij ) = 0 is not necessary to impose in
order to solve the equations.

II. The model.

This problem was posed by Arbab (see [3]). The equa-

tions of the model are:

(1)

8πG(t)
c4

Tij

2

and it is imposed that1:

div(Tij) = 0

where Λ(t) represent (stand) the cosmological “constant”.
The basic ingredients of the model are:
1. The line element deﬁned by:

ds2 = −c2dt2 + f 2(t)

dθ2 + sin 2θdφ2

dr2
1 − kr2 + r2

(cid:20)

(cid:0)

we only consider here the case k = 0.
2. The momentum-energy tensor deﬁned by:

Tij = (ρ + p

)uiuj − pgij

∗

where ρ is the energy density and p∗ represents pressure
[ρ] = [p∗]. The eﬀect of viscosity is seen in:

where: p is the thermostatic pressure, H = (f ′/f ) and ξ is
the viscosity coeﬃcient that follows the law:

p

= p − 3ξH

ξ = kγργ

(15)

where kγ makes the equation be homogeneous i.e.
it is a
constant with dimensions and where the constant γ ∈ [0, 1].
And p also veriﬁes the next state equation:

which is easily integrated.

(11), in such a way that the equation to be solved is now:

this equation is tried to be solved like this (see [10]). It
is deﬁned Λ = 3βH2
c2 where β is a numerical constant,
(hypothesis by Arbab (see [3]) as well as by Singh et al
(see [10]), condition that as we shall see, it is not neces-
sary to impose in the solution through D.A.) and from
the equation (7) the following relationship is obtained:
8πGρ = 3(1 − β)H 2. Hence if all the equalities are re-
placed in the equation (13) it yields:

We shall explore this section two dimensional methods.
The ﬁrst one, probably the simplest one, has the incon-
venience of having to depend on Einstein criterion(see [7]
and Barenblatt [6]), while the second one is more pow-
erful and more elaborated. We shall ﬁnish showing an
equation obtained without having to impose the condition
div(Tij) = 0.

The dimensional way followed in this section is probably
the most basic and simplest one. On one hand we integrate
independently the equation

div(Tij) = 0 ⇔ ρ

+ 3(ω + 1)ρ

= 0

(17)

f ′

(13)

not taking into account the term 9kγργH 2, since if we cal-
culate its order of magnitude we verify that is very small
≈ 10−40 following, then, an asymptotic method (or pertur-
bative) but this must be justiﬁed from a physical and/or
mathematical point of view. If we integrate the equation
(17) it is obtained the well-known relationship:

ρ = Aωf

−3(ω+1)

(18)

from this equation it is obtained one of the dimensional con-
stants of our problem: Aω, that has diﬀerent dimensions
and physical meaning depending on the state equation im-
posed i.e. it depends on ω. The other dimensional constant
considered has been obtained from the state equation (4)
i.e. ξ = kγργ, such constant kγ will also have diﬀerent di-
mensions depending on the value γ, in such a way that the

(14)

problem is reduced to the following set of quantities and
constants M.

M = (t, c, Aω, kγ, a)

where its respective dimensional equations in regard to a
base B = {L, M, T, θ} are (the base B of this type of mod-
els has been calculated in [9]):

[t] = T

[c] = LT −1

[Aω] = L2+3ωM T −2

[a] = L−1M T −2θ
[kγ] = Lγ−1M 1−γT 2n−1

−4

(19)

where a represents the radiation constant and it will be
take into account when we consider the thermodynamics
quantities.

Having done these considerations our aim is, therefore to
solve this model through D.A. The Pi-theorem will bring
us to obtain two π dimensionless monomials; one of them
will be the obtained in the case of a perfect ﬂuid ([2]) and
the other monomial will contain information on viscosity,
showing in this way that this type of models are very gener-
al, reproducing the results obtained in the case for perfect
ﬂuids. Since all solutions will depend on these two mono-
mials we must take into account Barenblatt criterion if we
mean to reach a satisfactory ﬁnal solution coincident with
the one obtained theoretically (see [3] and [10]).

B. Solutions through D.A.

We shall calculate through D.A. i.e. by applying Pi-
Theorem variation of G(t) in function on t, energy density
ρ(t), the radius of Universe f (t), the temperature θ(t), the
entropy S(t), the entropy density s(t) and ﬁnally the varia-
tion of the cosmological “constant” Λ(t). The dimensional
method brings us to (see [6] and [9]):

B.1 Calculation of G(t) :

G = G(t, c, Aω, kγ) where the dimensional equation of G
regarding to the base B is: [G] = L3M −1T −2 . Under this
circumstances, the application of Pi-Theorem brings us to
obtain the following dimensionless monomials:

we have obtained a “partial” solution, in order to reach a

Barenblatt criterion) and β is:

It is observed that the ﬁrst monomial (π1) is identical
to the one obtained in the paper ([2]) for perfect ﬂuids,

C. Diﬀerent Cases.

All the following cases that we go on to study now have
been studied by Arbab (see [3]) conﬁrming “¡!” his solution
([10]).

(20)

In obtaining all solutions depending on two monomials
we shall try to ﬁnd a solution to the problem expounded by
means of the Barenblatt criterion (for more details about
the method used here see [6] and [9]).

C.1 γ = 1/2 and ω = 1/3, Radiation predominance.

C.2 γ = 1/2 and ω = 0. Matter predominance

As we pointed out in the introduction the only mod-
els topologically equivalent to the ones of classic FRW are
those that follow the law ξ ∝ ξ0ρ1/2 i.e γ= 1/2 for its vis-
cous parameter. In this case we observe a Universe with
radiation predominance ω = 1/3. In order to obtain a com-
plete solution we shall take into account Barenblatt crite-
rion since, we have obtained the solutions depending on an
unknown function ϕ. In this case the substitution of the
values of ω and γ leads us to:

G ∝

To get rid of the unknown function ϕ we apply Baren-

of magnitude of each monomial3:

surprise that:

−2

ρ ∝ t

f ∝ t1/2

θ ∝ t

−1/2 S ∝ t0

s ∝ t2/3 Λ ∝ const.
As we see the model shows the same behavior in the prin-
cipal quantities as in the classic FRW model with radiation
predominance.

Let see, for example, how f has been calculated: Follow-

in such a way that

this case follows an identical behavior to the one obtained
in a model described by a perfect ﬂuid with G and Λ vari-

In this section we will combine dimensional techniques
with standard techniques of ODEs integration. With the
dimensional method, we go on to obtain dimensionless
monomials, which will be replaced in the equations. Thus,
the number of variables will be reduced in such a way that
the resulting equation is integrable in a trivial way. We
study two cases, the ﬁrst in which we consider div(Tij) = 0,
while in the other, as we shall see, such hypothesis is not
needed.

where a, d and g ∈ R (they are pure numbers). We can
also observe that this integral needs not be solved since a
more careful analysis about the number of π−monomials
that we can obtain from the equation leads us to obtain a
solution of the type:

which brings us to:

G = G(kγ, c, t)

This method, as we have seen, is more elaborated and the
solution, therefore, ﬁner though coincident with the previ-
ous one.

.6 Case in which div(Tij ) = 0 is not considered.

Let see now how we can tackle this problem from
the D.A. point of view, without imposing the condition
div(Tij) = 0. The base B as before, is still B = {L, M, T }
while the fundamental set of quantities and constants this
time is M = {t, c, kγ}, with these data we can obtain the
following monomials from the equation

and calculate f, arriving at the same solution obtained in
the above section i.e.

We have proved that it is not necessary to impose the con-
dition div(Tij) = 0 since it is obtained, in this case, the
same solution as the one obtain imposing it.

VI. Conclusions.

in which,

We have studied a cosmological model described by a
momentum-energy tensor characterized by a ﬂuid with
bulk viscosity,
furthermore, we have consid-
ered the constants G and Λ as functions depending on
time i.e. as variables and we have imposed the condition
div(Tij) = 0. We have proved how a suitable use of Dimen-
sional Analysis enables us to ﬁnd the solution of such model
in a “trivial” way. With the “Pretty simple method”, we
have obtained two π−monomials, one of them is the one
obtained in the case for a perfect ﬂuid ([2]) and the other
monomial contains the information about viscosity, show-
ing, in this way, that this type of models is very general
being able to reproduce the result obtained in the case of a
perfect ﬂuid. In order to solve the problem we have taken
into account Barenblatt criterion being able to arrive to ob-
tain a complete solution of the problem. Standing out that
our results coincide with the solutions obtained by Arbab
I. Arbab [3]. We have shown too that with the “not so
simple method” we arrive to solve the problem without ne-
cessity of impose any condition. We believe, nevertheless,
that the “simple method” can be more eﬀective, since, we
obtain more solutions with it or more complete solutions in
the sense of ﬁnding in it solutions such as Λ ∝ t−2 as well
as Λ = const. while the “not so simple method” the only
solution that is obtained is Λ ∝ t−2, but has the drawback
of depending on Barenblatt criterion i.e. we depend on the
always insecure numerical data.

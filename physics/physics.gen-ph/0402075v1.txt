A very simple hypothesis is that the Universe is the volume of an hypersphere in
4 dimensions, where our 3-dimensional world consists of hypersurfaces at different
radii. Base on this assumption it is possible to show that Universe expansion at a
rate corresponding to ﬂat comes as a direct geometrical consequence without in-
tervening critical density. Another consequence is the appearance of inertia swirls
of expanding matter, which can explain observed velocities around galaxies, again
without the intervention of dark matter. When restricted to more everyday situa-
tions the model degenerates in what has been called 4-dimensional optics; in the
paper this is shown to be equivalent to general relativity in all static isotropic metric
situations. In the conclusion some considerations bring the discussion to the realm
of 4D wave optics.

1 Introduction

In this work I make the simple hypothesis that the Universe can be modelled as the volume of
an hypersphere in 4 Euclidean dimensions. Naturally the position vector for any point has one
single coordinate, the distance to the center of the hypersphere, but displacements have all 4
coordinates: one distance and 3 angles. It is easy to evaluate the length of any displacement
and one can easily conclude that for small displacements, provided the distance to the center is
large, the angles can be replaced by distances on a plane tangent to an hyperspherical surface,
providing a local Euclidean frame for the study of displacements.

It
In general, though, the hyperspherical nature of the space has important consequences.
is shown that by assigning the meaning of time to the length of displacements one concludes
that the distance between any two points in a 3-dimensional hypersurface space increase at a
rate proportional to the distance; this is exactly what one ﬁnds in our Universe but is derived
as a consequence of geometry and not of any critical mass density. A similar argument applied

to rotary motion allows the conclusion that this is a natural form of inertial movement and
can be applied to galaxies’ dynamics to explain the exceedingly large orbital velocities that are
detected. Here too, geometry and not hidden mass is the main cause of movement. Naturally
mass densities are important for the detailed analysis of observations but they are responsible
only for perturbations of a global phenomenon with geometrical causes.

On a small scale the space becomes nearly Euclidean and it must be shown that this space is
adequate for the description of classical mechanics, at least as effectively as general relativity
does; dynamics in Euclidean 4-space is called 4-dimensional optics (4DO) because it is gov-
erned by an extension of Fermat’s principle. The paper demonstrates full equivalence between
dynamics in hyperbolic general relativity space and 4DO for the case of static isotropic metrics;
the particular case of Schwarzschild’s metric is analyzed and an exponential metric offering the
same predictions as Schwarzschild’s is proposed.

2 4-dimensional hyperspheric coordinates

As an introduction to 4-dimensional hyperspheric coordinates it is useful to revise the case
of spherical coordinates in 3 dimensions. The position vector for any point is always written
s = rσr, where σr is a unitary vector. If needed we can always express σr in terms of the
orthonormed frame {σ1, σ2, σ3}

σr = sin θ cos φ σ1 + sin θ sin φ σ2 + cos θ σ3.

We say that {σ1, σ2, σ3} is a ﬁducial frame because it is orthonormed and its vectors don’t rotate
in a displacement.

A displacement in spherical coordinates is the vector

ds = ∂rs dr + ∂θs dθ + ∂φs dφ.

Resorting to the ﬁducial frame we can establish the derivatives of σr

∂rσr = 0,

∂θσr = σθ,

∂φσr = cos θ σφ,

where {σr, σθ, σφ} form a new orthonormed frame which is not a ﬁducial frame because its
vectors rotate.

σθ = cos θ cos φ σ1 + cos θ sin φ σ2 − sin θσ3,
σφ = − sin φ σ1 + cos φ σ2.

We can express this rotation by a set of partial derivatives

∂rσr = 0,
∂rσθ = 0,
∂rσφ = 0, ∂θσφ = 0,

∂θσr = σθ,
∂φσr = sin θσφ,
∂θσθ = −σr, ∂φσθ = cos θσφ,

∂φσφ = − sin θ σr − cos θ σθ.

The displacement vector can now be found by application of the derivatives to Eq. (2)

ds = σrdr + rσθdθ + r sin θσφdφ.

A coordinate frame for spherical coordinates can’t be {σr, σθ, σφ}, however, because the general
deﬁnition for a coordinate frame is gµ = ∂µs, Hestenes [1]. Using Eq. (8) we can write

gr = σr,

gθ = rσθ,

gφ = r sin θ σφ.

The displacement vector ds is now written in the general form

ds = gjdxj;

where the index j is replaced by (r, θ, φ), xµ represents the coordinates r, θ, φ, respectively,
and the summation convention for repeated indices is used. Deﬁning the metric tensor elements
gjj = gj ·gj we can evaluate an interval by

2
(ds)

= ds·ds = gµν dxjdxj.

The spherical coordinates example can now be easily extended to a general situation in 4
dimensions. We will consider 4-dimensional space with hyperspheric symmetry where R is
the distance to the origin and αj, j = 1, 2, 3 are angles. The position vector is naturally s =
Rσ0, with σ0 the unit vector of the radial direction; the displacement vector is obtained by
extrapolation of Eq. (8)

ds = dRσ0 + R

(12)

If the displacements are small compared to the hypersphere radius R, we can choose a privileged
origin for the angles such that all the angles are small and the sines become unity.

ds = dRσ0 + R

We will now deﬁne the new coordinates xj = Rαj so that dxj = dRαj + Rdαj. Inverting the
relation it is Rdαj = dxj − dRxj/R. Replacing above

We are going to interpret the coordinate R as the time elapsed from the Universe’s ori-
gin, albeit measured as length, and coordinates xj as being the usual x, y, z coordinates of
3-dimensional space. We will develop the consequences of this interpretation in the following
paragraphs.

Light travels with velocity c in 3-space and the model can accommodate it by zeroing the dis-
placement in the radial direction.

Proceeding to the analysis of massive particle’s dynamics we note that the Euler-Lagrange
equations for the geodesics of any Riemanian space can be derived from a constant Lagrangian,
made equal to 1/2 for convenience [2]. Using Eq. (17) we can make the second member equal
to twice the Lagrangian and derive the corresponding geodesic equations. The four conjugate
momenta are

meaning that all free particles are slowed down, the negative acceleration being equal to the
fraction ˙R/R. This extraordinary result is a consequence of our peculiar choice of coordinates;
if we had used angles instead of distances the Lagrangian would be established from Eq. (13)

and being independent from αj it would have implied conservation of the associated conjugate
momenta. Essentially we would have concluded that, in an expanding Universe, angular veloci-
ties with respect to R are conserved quantities.

Returning to Eq. (17) we have to decide if and when the term ˙Rxj/R can be neglected in face

of ˙xj. The condition we want can be expressed by

which we will assign below to the tame it takes light to travel from the conﬁnes of the Universe.
This condition is met for nearby objects which are not moving exceedingly slow; when it can be
met Eq. (17) reduces to

placing an upper limit on the speed of moving particles. It is also apparent that the movement of
masses implies that they move outwards in the Universe through ˙R.

X

Returning to Eq. (22) it is easy to conclude that for bodies comoving with the Universe’s
expansion we must have constant αj and ˙R = c, so the Universe must be expanding at the speed
of light. For the distance coordinates we get

H is the Hubble parameter and its measurement gives us the size of present day Universe. If we
use for the Hubble parameter a value of 81 km s−1/Mpc the resulting size for the Universe is
1.2 × 1010 ly.

The constant orbital velocity observed in the periphery of most galaxies (ωr = constant) is
one of the big puzzles in the Universe which is normally explained with recourse to massive
halos of dark matter [3, 4], although some have tried different explanations with limited success;
for instance Milgrom [5, 6] modiﬁed Newton dynamics empirically. Below we look at the
predictions of the hypersphere model for orbital velocities to verify that such explanations are
not needed if one accepts that the universe is expanding as an hypersphere.

The gravitational ﬁeld on the periphery of a galaxy must be negligible without the dark matter
halo contribution. The question we will try to answer is wether the Universe expansion can drive
a rotation, once the material has been set in motion by some other means. In the afﬁrmative
case we must ﬁnd out if the rotation speed can be kept invariant with distance to the center, as
observed in galaxies. Recalling Eq. (14) we will rewrite this equation in spherical coordinates

ds = dRσ0 + drσr + rdθσθ + r sin θdφσφ −

rσr.

(27)

dR
R

Notice the last term and compare it to Eq. (14); we have replaced xjσj by rσr in a standard
passage from Cartesian to spherical coordinates. It is usual to make θ = π/2 whenever dealing
with orbits, because we know in advance that orbits are ﬂat. Deﬁning dt2 = ds2 and calling v
to ds/dt we can write

v = ˙Rσ0 +

(28)

If the parenthesis vanishes the movement becomes circular without any central potential; it is
driven solely by the galaxy expanding at the same rate as the Universe. The equation above
shows that r ˙φ = constant is the natural inertia condition for the hyperspheric Universe; swirls

˙R/R. In any
will be maintained by a radial expansion rate which exactly matches the quotient
practical situation ˙R will be very near the speed of light and the quotient will be virtually equal
to the hubble parameter; thus the expansion rate for sustained rotation is ˙r/r = H. If applied
to our neighbor galaxy Andromeda, with a radial extent of 30 kpc, using the Hubble parameter
value of 81 km s−1/Mpc, as above, the expansion velocity is about 2.43km s−1; this is to be
compared with the orbital velocity of near 300km s−1.

The model proposed for galaxy dynamics consists of a core dominated by gravitational and
electromagnetic interactions from which some material escapes and starts swirling by inertia,
while continuing to be accelerated by the remnants of gravity; near the periphery all the gravity
is extinct and only inertial rotations prevails.

4 Curved space dynamics

The hypersphere model would be useless if it could not be made compatible with classical
mechanics in everyday situations; in this paragraph we will see that full compatibility exists.

represent R the interval of that space is given by

In this space Eq. (24) establishes that everything moves with the speed of light and it becomes
natural to extend to 4-space Fermat’s principle which governs geometric optics in 3D

where n is a function of coordinates 1 to 3, called refractive index, deﬁned as the ratio between
local 4-speed and the speed of light in vacuum.

The extension of Fermat’s principle to 4D justiﬁes our use of the designation 4-dimensional
optics to refer the study of 4D dynamics and wave propagation; we will use the acronym 4DO
as a substitute for the full designation. From this point onwards we will make c = 1 following
the uses of general relativity papers, which corresponds to using actual displacements measured
in length rather than time units.

In an homogeneous medium Eq. (30) states that trajectories are straight lines in 4-space; in
particular when n = 1, everything moves with 4-velocity with modulus equal to the speed of
light in vacuum. Geometric optics in 3D becomes a direct consequence of 4DO and is obtained
from Eq. (30) by setting dx0 = 0, in agreement with our previous contention that photons travel
on 3D space;

The integrand in Fermat’s principle, nds, can be replaced by dt, allowing its interpretation

The anisotropy relative to coordinate x0 is not apparent in 3 dimensions, and the medium can
still be classiﬁed as isotropic. An alternative interpretation of Eq˙(34) is in terms of interval of
curved isotropic space; it is equivalent saying that particles and radiation travel slower than in
vacuum in a given region of space and saying that in the same region space is curved. Following

We conclude that at least for static isotropic metrics the geodesics of general relativity can be
mapped to those of 4DO and so it is a matter of personal preference which formalism each one
uses. We believe that the proof can be extended to all static metrics but that is immaterial for the
present work.

We will now look at Schwarzschild’s metric to see how it can be transposed to 4D optics. We
will have to use the dimensionless variable Gm/(c2r), where G is the gravitational constant.
Since a dimensionless variable can be built with Lm/(Mr), where M is the mass standard, we
will choose M = GL/c2 = GT 2/L and avoid constants in the expressions.

We turn now to the constraints on the refractive indices so that experimental data on light

For compatibility with Kepler’s 1st order predictions α = 1; then, for compatibility with ob-
served planet orbits, β = 1/2. Together with the constraint for n0, these are the conditions that
must be veriﬁed by the refractive indices to be in agreement with experimental data.

We know, of course, that the refractive indices corresponding to Schwarzschild’s metric verify
the constraints above, however that is not the only possibility. Schwarzschild’s metric is a con-
sequence of Einstein’s equations when one postulates that vacuum is empty of mass and energy,
but the same does not necessarily apply in 4DO. Leaving an open question about what equations
should be the counterparts of Einstein’s in 4DO, one interesting possibility for the refractive
indices, in full agreement with observations, is provided by

These refractive indices are as effective as those derived from Schwarzschild’s metric for light
bending and perihelium advance prediction, although they do not predict black holes. There
is a singularity for r = 0 which is not a physical difﬁculty since before that stage quantum
phenomena have to be considered and the metric ceases to be applicable; in other words, we
must change from geometric to wave optics approach.

5 Conclusion

This work is a natural development of speculations I started to make almost 4 years ago about
4DO being an alternative formulation for relativity. At the onset the reasoning was that if one
wants to restrict 3-dimensional velocity to the speed of light, a logical thing to do is to postulate
a 4th dimension and then state that velocity is always equal to the speed of light but can make
different angles to the 4th dimension. If then only the 3-dimensional projection of velocity is

considered this can take any value between 0 and the speed of light.

made several mistakes along the way but I don’t intend to remove the respective essays because
they will allow readers to trace the track I’ve followed. There is one work which I still think is
important that people read [9], where a comparison is established between special relativity and
4DO using the method known as K-calculus.

The hypersphere model of the Universe is a generalization of 4DO; it is simpler in terms of ba-
sic postulates and incorporates 4DO for everyday situations of classical mechanics. That model
is capable of explaining such puzzles as Universe ﬂatness or orbital velocities around galax-
ies as resulting entirely from geometry, does avoiding the discomfort of postulating enormous
amounts of dark matter. When dealing with classical mechanics problems 4DO was proven to
be equivalent to general relativity in all situations characterized by static isotropic metrics and
this equivalence is most likely extendable to all static metric situations.

One point that made people react against 4DO in the past was the difﬁculty in understanding
the meaning of coordinate x0. In fact geodesics of 4DO space can be mapped to those of rela-
tivity but the same does not happen with points in both spaces. A point where two relativistic
geodesics cross is not mapped to the crossing point of the corresponding geodesics in 4DO. A
point in relativistic space is interpreted as an event and the meaning of points in 4DO space is
difﬁcult to grasp. It is important to consider that 4DO is a space for optics so an elementary
particle travelling in a given direction with a known momentum should not be interpreted as a
trajectory in 4DO but rather as a plane wave that can be represented by any line normal to the
wavefronts.

An example taken from optics may clarify the situation. Imagine a plane wave travelling along
the x direction and another plane wave travelling at some angle to x. It makes no sense to ask
at what position along x the two waves meet because they meet everywhere. However, if these
waves were synchronized by some means, for instance if they were split from the same laser
beam and then redirected to converge, it would be possible to measure the length travelled by

the two waves and there would be a particular position where the two measurements would be
equal. In 4DO all trajectories are representative of waves that were essentially all split from the
same source when the big bang happened; so even if there is a multitude of lines representing a
trajectory it is possible to deﬁne events as those points where two measurements along different
paths become equal.

In this work we took the approach of trajectories, which is the 4DO equivalent to geometrical
optics; in the future it is planned to extend this analysis with the help of wave and Fourier optics
in their 4-dimensional extensions.

We have shown in the paper that for time with fractional dimensions (multifractal time theory)
there are small domain of velocities v near v = c where SR must be replaced by fractal theory
of almost inertial system that doe’s not contains an inﬁnity and permits moving with arbitrary
velocities.

I. INTRODUCTION

The special relativity theory (SR) is one of the physics
theories that are compose the base of the modern physics,
it has well experimental foundation in the large area of
the reached velocities and energies, is the working the-
ory of a modern physics and widely use in a science and
technique. Nevertheless, as any physical theory created
by men, SR has a boundaries of applicability (the inertial
systems of reference). As far as we know a problem of
energy boundaries SR for any moving body was not ana-
lyzed in detail. At the same time the tends of energy of a
moving body when it’s velocity reaches the value of speed
of light to inﬁnity calls doubts in applicability SR in this
area of energies, as the occurrence of inﬁnity in the phys-
ical theories always testiﬁes about their interior deﬁcien-
cies. The purpose of the paper is presenting the theory
of almost inertial systems in the space with multifractal
time (I believe that time and space of our world may have
multifractal characteristics) in which the motions of bod-
ies with arbitrary velocities are possible and there are no
energy inﬁnity. At the same time if the energies reached
by a body, as a result of it’s motion, are smaller than
E0103sec1/2 t−1/2 (t-time of acceleration of a particle up
to such energies, E0- a rest energy) all results of the the-
ory coincide with results of SR and thus do not contradict
experiment. The diﬀerences between our theory and SR
appear only if energy of moving body exceeds the energy
E0103sec1/2t−1/2. The theory is based on using, but as
a good approach, of a principle of the constancy speed
of light, an invariance of modiﬁed Galilean and Lorentz
transformation laws. This theory is not a generalization
of SR, because any SR generalizations in the domain of
validity SR (inertial systems) are absurd. This theory
describes relative movements only in the almost inertial
systems, and thus does not contradict SR, thou coincide
with it for case of inertial systems. For constructing such
theory it is necessary to refuse from the rigorous realiza-
tion of the SR postulates: a homogeneous of space and
time, the constancy of speed of light, the Galilean rela-
tivity principle. In an inhomogeneous space and time, if

the inhomogeneous are small, the motion of bodies will
be almost inertial, and velocity of light is almost sta-
tionary value. This paper contains the example of the
theory based on the time and the space with fractional
dimensions (FD) [1] . This theory use for description of
time and space characteristics the ideas of fractal geom-
etry. The values FD are a little bit distinguished from
the integer dimensions (the theory of multifractal time
and space is given in [1]. In fractal theory the motions
of particles with arbitrary velocities are permissible, the
speed of light is almost independent from the velocity of
lights sources. For example, on the surface of Earth the
diﬀerences of value of speed of light under change mov-
ing direction v by −v consist ∼ 2v/c10−6t. The theory
almost coincides with SR, for velocities which are lesser
than speed of light but does not includes singularities at
v = c.

II. MULTIFRACTAL TIME

Following [1], we will consider both time and space as
the initial real material ﬁelds existing in the world and
generating all other physical ﬁelds. Assume that every
of them consists of a continuous, but not diﬀerentiable
bounded set of small elements (elementary intervals, fur-
ther treated as ”points”). Consider the set of small time
elements St. Let time be deﬁned on multifractal sub-
sets of such elements, deﬁned on certain measure car-
rier R\. Each element of these subsets (or ”points”) is
characterized by the fractional (fractal) dimension (FD)
dt(r(t), t) and for diﬀerent elements FD are diﬀerent. In
this case the classical mathematical calculus or fractional
(say, Riemann - Liouville) calculus [2] can not be applied
to describe a small changes of a continuous function of
physical values f (t), deﬁned on time subsets St, because
the fractional exponent depends on the coordinates and
time. Therefore, we have to introduce integral function-
als (both left-sided and right-sided) which are suitable to
describe the dynamics of functions deﬁned on multifrac-
tal sets (see [1]). Actually, these functionals are simple

ally, n = {d} + 1 , where {d} is the integer part of d if
If
d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤ d < n) and n = 0 for d < 0.
d = const, the generalized fractional derivatives (GFD)
(1)-(2) coincide with the Riemann - Liouville fractional
derivatives (d ≥ 0) or fractional integrals (d < 0). When
d = n+ε(t), ε(t) → 0, GFD can be represented by means
of integer derivatives and integrals. For n = 1, that is,
d = 1 + ε, |ε| << 1 it is possible to obtain:

where a is constant and deﬁned by the choice of the rules
of regularization of integrals (1)-(2) (for more detailed see
[1]). The selection of the rule of regularization that gives
a real additives for usual derivative in (3) yield a = 0.5
for d < 1 and a = 1.077 for d > 1 [1]. The functions
under integral sign in (1)-(2) we consider as the gener-
alized functions deﬁned on the set of the ﬁnite functions
[3]. The notions of GFD, similar to (1)-(2), can also be
deﬁned and for the space variables r.

The deﬁnitions of GFD (2)-(2) are formal until the
connections between fractal dimensions of time dt(r(t), t)
and certain characteristics of physical ﬁelds (say, poten-
tials Φi(r(t), t), i = 1, 2, ..) or densities of Lagrangians
Li) are determined. Following [1], we deﬁne this connec-
tion by the relation

dt(r(t), t) = 1 +Xi

βiLi(Φi(r(t), t))

(4)

i in the form β′

where Li are densities of energy of physical ﬁelds, βi are
dimensional constants with physical dimension of [Li]−1
(it is worth to choose β′
i = a−1βi for the
sake of independence from regularization constant). The
deﬁnition of time as the system of subsets and deﬁnition
the FD d (see 4) connects the value of fractional (fractal)
dimension dt(r(t), t) with each time instant t. The latter
depends both on time t and coordinates r. If dt = 1 (an
absence of physical ﬁelds) the set of time has topological
dimension equal to unity. The multifractal model of time
allows, as will be shown below, to consider the divergence
of energy of masses moving with speed of light in the SR
theory as the result of the requirement of rigorous validity
of the laws pointed out in the beginning of this paper in
the presence of physical ﬁelds (in our theory there are
approximate fulﬁllment of these laws).

2

Because of the non-uniformity of time in our multi-
fractal model, the speed of light, just as in the general
relativity theory, depends on potentials of physical ﬁelds
that deﬁne the fractal dimensions of time dt(r(t), t) (see
(4)).
If fractal dimension dt(r(t), t) is close enough to
unity (dt(r(t), t) = 1 + ε, |ε| << 1), the diﬀerence of
the speed of light in moving (with velocity v along the
x axis) and ﬁxed frame of reference will be small.
In
the systems that move with respect to each other with
almost constant velocity (stationary velocities do not ex-
ist in the mathematical theory based on the deﬁnitions
of GFD (1) - (2)) the speed of light can not be taken
as a fundamental constant. In the multifractal time the-
ory the principle of the speed of light invariance can be
considered only as approximate. But if ε is small, it al-
lows to consider a nonlinear coordinates transformations
from the ﬁxed frame to the moving frame (replacing the
Galilean transformations in non-uniform time and space),
as close to linear (weakly nonlinear) transformations and,
thus, makes it possible to preserve the conservation laws,
and all the invariant’s of the Minkowski space, as the
approximate laws. Then the way of reasoning and argu-
mentation accepted in SR theory (see for example, ( [4]))
can also remains valid. Designating the coordinates in
the moving and ﬁxed frames of reference through x′ and
x, accordingly, we write down

x′ = α(t, x)[x − v(x, t)t(x(t), t]
x = α′(t, x)[x′ + v′(x′(t′), t′), t′(x′(t′), t′)

(5)
In (5) α 6= α′ and the velocities v′ and v (as well as t
and t′) are not equal (it follows from the inhomogeneous
of multifractal time). Place clocks in origins of both the
frame of references and let the light signal be emitted in
the moment, when the origins of the ﬁxed and moving
frames coincide in space and time at the instant t1 = t =
0 and in points x′ = x = 0. The propagation of light in
moving and ﬁxed frames of reference is then determined
by equations

x′ = c′t′ x = ct

(6)

These equations characterize the propagation of light in
both of the frames of reference at every moment. Due to
the time inhomogeneous c′
6= c, but since |ε << 1| the
diﬀerence between velocities of light in the two frames of
reference will be small. For this case we can neglect by
the diﬀerences between α′ and α and, for diﬀerent frames
of reference write the expressions for velocities of light
(using (3) to deﬁne velocity (denote f (t) = x, dx/dt =
c0)). Thus we obtain

c = D1+ε

The equalities (9) and (10) appear in our model of mul-
tifractal time as the result of the statement, that in this
model all the frames of reference are absolute frames of
reference (because of the real nature of the time ﬁeld)
and the speed of light depends on the state of frames:
if the frame of reference is a moving or a ﬁxed one, if
the object under consideration in this frame moves or
not. This dependence disappears only when ε = 0. Be-
fore substitution the relations (5) in the equalities (7) -
(10) (with α′ ≈ α) it is necessary to ﬁnd out how dε/dt
depends on α. Using for this purpose equation (4) we
obtain:

there is no explicit dependence of Li on time)

of reference are absolute frames of reference). Taking into
account (5), the relations (13) - (16) take the forms

Once again we note, that the four equations for c′
1 and
c1t1, instead of the two equations in special relativity, ap-
pear as the consequences of the absolute character of the
motion and frames of reference in the model of multifrac-
tal time. In the right-hand side of (17) - (18) the depen-
dence of velocity of light on fractal dimensions of time
is not taken into account (just as in the equations (13) -
(16)). Actually, this dependence leads to pretty unwieldy
expressions. But if we retain only the terms that de-

pend on β =p|1 − v2/c2| or a0 and neglect non-essential

terms containing the products βα0, utilizing (13) - (16)
after the multiplication of the four equalities (17) - (18),
we receive the following equation for α (it satisﬁes to all
four equations):

IV. LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS AND

TRANSFORMATIONS OF LENGTH

AND TIME IN MULTIFRACTAL TIME MODEL

The Lorentz transformations, as well as transforma-
tions of coordinate frames of reference, in the multifractal
model of time are nonlinear due to the dependence of the
fractional dimensions of time dt(r, t) on coordinates and
time. Since the nonlinear corrections to Lorentz trans-
formation rules are very small for ε ≪ 1, we shall take
into account only the corrections that eliminate the sin-
gularity at the velocity v = c. It yields in the replace-
ment of the factor β−1 in Lorentz transformations by the
modiﬁed factor α = 1/β∗ given by (22). The Lorentz

(16)

Since in our model the motion and frames of reference
are absolute, the times t1 and t′
1 correspond to the cases,
when the moving and ﬁxed frames of reference exchange
their roles - the moving one becomes ﬁxed and vice versa.
These times coincide only when ε = 0. The times in
square brackets, as well as the velocities, are taken to
equal, because the terms containing them are small as
compared to unity. The principle of invariance of the
velocity of light for transition between the moving and
ﬁxed frames of reference in multifractal time model is
approximate (though quite natural, because the frames

transformation rules (for the motion along the x axis)
take the form

x′ =

β∗ (x − vt), t′ 1

β∗ (t − x

v
c2 )

(23)

In the equations (22) and (23) the velocities v and c
weakly depend on x and t and their contribution to
the singular terms are small. Hence, we can neglect by
this dependence. The transformations from ﬁxed system
to moving system are almost orthogonal (for ε ≪ 1 ),
and the squares of almost four-dimensional the energy-
momentum vectors of Minkowski space vary under the
coordinates transformations very slightly (i.e. they are
almost invariant). Then it is possible to neglect the cor-
rection terms of order about O(ε, ˙ε), which, for not equal
to inﬁnity variables, are very small too. From (22) -
(23) the possibility of arbitrary velocity motion of bod-
ies with nonzero rest mass follows. With the corrections
of to order O(ε, ˙ε) in nonsingular terms being neglected,
the momentum and energy of a body with a nonzero rest
mass in the frame of reference moving along the x axis
(E0 = m0c2) equal to

The energy of such a body reaches its maximal value at

v = c and is equal then Ev=c ≈ E0/√2α0. When v → ∞
the energy is ﬁnite an tends to E0√2. For v ≤ c the total

energy of a body is represented by the expression

For v ≥ c, total energy, deﬁned by (24), is given by

If we take into account only the gravitational ﬁeld of
Earth (here, as in ( [5]),the gravitational ﬁeld is a real
ﬁeld) and neglect by the inﬂuences of all the other ﬁelds),
the parameter a0(t) can be estimated as a0 = r0R−3xEct,
where r0 is the gravitational radius of Earth, r is the
distance from the Earth’s surface to its center (ε =
0.5βgΦg, βg = 2c−2, xE ∼ r0, v = c). For energy max-
imum we get Emax ∼ E0 · 103t−0.5sec−0.5.
If we take
into account only the constant electric ﬁeld with electric
strange E then parameter a0 has the value:a0 = eE
Mc2 ct
where M c2 is the rest energy of charges originated the
strange E and t is the time of acceleration of particle.
Contraction of lengths and the retardation of time in
moving frames of reference in the model of multifractal
time are also have several peculiarities. Let l and t be
the length and time interval in a ﬁxed frame of reference.
In a moving frame

l′ = β∗l, t′ = β∗t

(27)

Thus, there exist the maximal contraction of length when
the body’s velocity equals the speed of light, but length is
not equal to zero. With the further increasing of velocity
(if it is possible to fulﬁll some requirements for a motion
in this region with constant velocity without radiating),
the length of a body begins to grow and at inﬁnitely large
velocity is also inﬁnite. The retardation of time, from the
point of view of the observer in the ﬁxed system (maximal
retardation equals to t′ = t√2a0) is replaced, with the
further increase of velocity over the speed of light, by
acceleration of a ﬂow of time (t → 0 when v → ∞).
but β is replaced by β∗

The rule for velocities transformation keeps its form,

(28)

Since there is no law that prohibits velocities greater than
that of light, the velocities in (28) can also exceed the
speed of light. The electrodynamics of moving media in
the model of multifractal time can be obtained, in most
cases, by the substitution β → β∗.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The theory of relative motions in almost inertial sys-
tems based on the multifractal time theory [1] and con-
structed in this paper gives in the new describing for
characteristics (energy, momentum, mass and so on) of
moving bodies. The main results are:a) the possibility
of moving with arbitrary velocities without appearance
of inﬁnitum energy and imaginary mass; b) existence of
maximum energy if v = c; c) possibility of experimen-
tal veriﬁcation the main results of the theory. This the-
ory describes open systems (theory of open systems see
in [6]). The theory coincides with SR after transition
to inertial systems (if neglect by the fractional dimen-
sions of time) or almost coincides (the diﬀerences are
non-essential) for velocities v < c. The movement of
bodies with velocities that exceed the speed of light is
accompanied by a series of physical eﬀect’s which can be
found experimentally (these eﬀects was considered in the
separate papers ( [1]) in more details). It is necessary for
veriﬁcation of the theory to receive the particle’s with en-
ergy E ∼
where t0 deﬁned by (31). If take into
account the radiation losses of energy, it will be enough to
receive at the intervals of time acceleration of the particle
about one second the energies of order E ∼ E0103.

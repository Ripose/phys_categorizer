Abstract

Gauge theory amplitudes in a non-helicity format are generated at all n-point and
at tree level. These amplitudes inherit structure from φ3 classical scattering, and the
string inspired formalism is used to ﬁnd the tensor algebra. All of the classical gravity
amplitudes are also given. The classical eﬀective action can also be constructed.
Generalizations to amplitudes with non spin-1 or 2 is possible.

Introduction

The tree amplitudes of gauge theories have recently been under much scrutiny, in
view of the simpliﬁed derivation using the weak-weak duality of the gauge theory with
a twistor formulation. The string inspired formulation of perturbative amplitudes,
in addition to the techniques based on factorization and unitarity, have prompted
further interest in their computation. Helicity tree amplitudes up to 10 point are
presented in the literature, due to these methods.

The gauge and gravity tree amplitudes are presented here at n-point. String
inspired methods and scalar scattering are required to ﬁnd their form. The form
can be used to ﬁnd the full classical eﬀective action in gauge theory and in gravity,
in practical applications such as jet physics, and in further studies of duality. An
automation of the n-point tree amplitudes in gauge theory is useful for Monte Carlo
simulations.

The massless φ3 diagrams and their speciﬁcation are required in order to ﬁnd the
gauge theory and gravity theory tree-level amplitudes. The string inspired represen-
tation of the latter utilizing the Koba-Nielsen amplitude, and its ﬁeld theory limit,
require the momentum routing of the propagators in a diagram and its correlated
tensor algebra. The form of the φ3 classical scattering presented in [1] has the re-
quired momentum parameterization. The tensor algebra is computed with the scalar
form.

The gauge and gravity amplitudes are obtained in a no helicity basis, but in
closed form via the known string-inspired tree-level rules. Spinor helicity is used in
conjunction with the gauge invariance of the amplitudes to shorten the expressions.
The choice of reference momenta in the gauge invariant sets of diagrams that gener-
ates the simplest amplitude expression is not known in the literature; this algebraic
question discussed in [2], and its answer, is relevant for both formal and applied uses.
Diﬀerent forms of the amplitudes lend to diﬀerent interpretations and make manifest
diﬀerent properties, such as a twistor representation, a self-dual ﬁeld form including
a WZW model, or a potential iterative number basis form as in [2]. The compact
nature is important for practical applications.

These classical amplitudes, both in scalar and gauge ﬁeld theories, are required
to bootstrap to higher orders. The derivative expansion has been developed in [3]-[11]
and the classical amplitudes are the initial conditions.

form is required with the string scattering expression and the string inspired formu-

plitude. The sets of permutations σ are what are required in order to specify the
individual diagrams. The full sets of σ(i, p) form all of the diagrams, at any n-point
order.

The vertices of the ordered φ3 diagram are labeled so that the outer numbers
from a two-particle tree are carried into the tree diagram in a manner so that j > i is
always chosen from these two numbers. The numbers are carried in from the n most
external lines.

The labeling of the vertices is such that in a current or on-shell diagram the
unordered set of numbers are suﬃcient to reconstruct the current; the set of numbers
on the vertices are collected in a set φm(j). For an m-point current there are m
1
vertices and hence m
1 numbers are such
−
that the greatest number may occur m
1 times, and must occur at least once, the
next largest number may occur at most m
2 times (and may or may not appear
in the set, as well as the subsequent ones), and so on. The smallest number can not
occur in the set contained in φm(j). Amplitudes are treated in the same manner as
currents. Examples and a more thorough analysis is presented in [1].

The numbers φn(i) can be arranged into the numbers (pi, [pi]), in which pi is
the repetition of the value of [pi]. Also, if the number pi equals zero, then [pi] is
not present in φn. These numbers can be used to obtain the t[q]

The branch rule has to be iterated to obtain all of the poles. This rule checks the
number of vertices and matches to compare if there is a tree on it in a clockwise
manner. If not, then the external line number linitial is changed to linitial and the tree
is checked again. The i and q are labels to t[q]

attached vertex has two external lines with numbers less than the smallest external
line number of the current (permutations to other sets of φn does not change the
formalism). There are n

Gauge Amplitudes: Tensor Algebra

The gauge theory amplitudes are computed with the string inspired formulation.
The amplitudes are projected onto a color basis, so that only the amplitude with leg
ordering 1, . . . , n is analyzed. The color prefactor is TrTa1 . . . Tan; permutations are
used to obtain diﬀerent orderings. The momentum routing of the propagators, Cσ is
ǫj appearing
required in order to specify the combinations of products ǫi ·
in a φ3 diagram. The string-inspired formalism based on pinching the Koba-Nielsen
formula generates a symmetric set of graph rules [13] which is well adapted to the
general expressions of scalar tree amplitudes.

The products in (15) are used in conjunction with the individual φ3 diagrams to
determine the gauge theory amplitudes. The string-inspired rules, found in the ﬁeld
theory limit of the KN tree formula, are applied to the formula in (15).

The permutation set ρ(m, 1; i) and ρ(m, 2; i) are derived via picking p numbers
from the collection 1, . . . , n for each of the sets. These p numbers are non-overlapping
in both ρ(m, 1; ) and ρ(m, 2; ) as there is no duplication of the ε vectors. All possible
combinations are required; there are 2p! permutations of the sets’ elements, and
n!/p!(n
p)! choices of the p elements from the total number of n polarizations. The
overcounting is 2p as each of the pairs of polarizations is unordered.

−

The string inspired rules require that, from the expansion in (15), there are a
˙GB terms appearing in coordination with the labeling of the color
certain number of
ordered φ3 diagram. The presence of the ˙GB terms is accompanied by the kinematic
factors multiplying them, i.e. the tensor algebra.

The vertices of the φ3 are numbered as in the previous section. The labeling of
the numbers in the vertices is correlated with the set of numbers contained in σ(i, p);
physically, the speciﬁcation of the multi-particle poles generates the labeling. Each
vertex number in a tree is labeled by taking the clockwise number in the two outer
nodes i and j of the same tree. The numbers are found by starting with the outermost
external leg numbers, which range from 1 to n in a cyclic fashion for the color ordering
1, . . . , n. The numbers are such that i > j, with i and j the two outer points on the
two-particle tree, is always chosen from the choice of the two numbers.

The vertices are associated with ˙GB(i, j) worldsheet bosonic Greens functions.
Each vertex requires one of these ˙GB with the two indices as: one of them labeled by

the node, the other with one of the numbers so as to be in the outer tree. The choice
of the latter to encompass the outer tree generates a ’primary’ choice of the ˙GB. Each
vertex is associated with precisely one ˙GB factor; these factors are set equal to unity
and the kinematics associated with the combination generates the tensor algebra.

The set of numbers φn(i) discussed in the previous section gives a route to ﬁnding
the poles t[p]
. These numbers, as discussed in [1], are representative of a discrete
i
symmetry in the classical scattering. The same numbers are used to ﬁnd the tensor
algebra on the scalar graphs of the gauge theory.

Both the gauge and gravitational scatterings may be gauge covariantized using
the ﬁeld strengths Fµν and Rµν, to write the classical eﬀective action. The classi-
cal eﬀective action is relevant to the DBI work, soliton eﬀects including black hole
dynamics, and the anti-de Sitter correspondence with gauge theory.

Concluding remarks

Gauge and gravity amplitudes are found at tree level and with any number of legs.
The analagous scalar ﬁeld theory amplitudes have appeared in [1]. The amplitudes are
generated without specifying the helicity content. Two sets of numbers are required
to delimit the contributions, φn of the vertices and t[p]
of the poles, and they are
i
equivalent.

Gravity interactions, by varying

ddxR√g, possess an inﬁnite number of vertices
and makes the calculation of an all n-point formula tedious. The amplitudes are
found by utilizing the KLT factorization of string tree scattering.

R

These gauge and gravity amplitudes use the number parameterization of φ3 dia-
grams. The latter have ’symmetries’ accorded to them via the collection of numbers
φn(j) used to construct the individual graphs (see [1]). These sets may also be used to
classically quantize gauge and gravity, which should generalize to the quantum level.

The string form of the scattering amplitudes together with the scalar ﬁeld re-
sults should allow for a generalization of the all n amplitudes to contain fermionic
modes, (p, q) tensor modes, mixed spins in the asymptotic states, and including the
electroweak sector.

These amplitudes are required in order to bootstrap to the quantum level. Also,
a closed form of the classical amplitudes is useful for Monte Carlo simulations for
particle beam simulations.

QED - lassially. An intuitive Approah

Tibor Dudas

Brief introdution

This paper deals with QED-partiles and the interation between them on a

lassial level. The Maxwell-equations are used mainly. (Proofs are not used

in a mathematial but intuitive sense.) In the (cid:28)rst step the main statements

are presented. The orresponding proofs are given in the seond and (cid:28)nal

step.

Statements

I. An eletron/positron is a sink/soure of eletromagneti salar quanta.

II. These eletromagneti salar (cid:28)eld quanta should learly be identi(cid:28)ed

with photons.

III. Charge-harge interation is easily oneivable.

IV. The magneti vetor (cid:28)eld onstitutes a (cid:29)ow of photons.

V. It beomes lear, why a harged partile is de(cid:29)eted perpendiular to

the magneti (cid:28)eld lines.

Proofs

I. Lemma. It is su(cid:30)ient to onsider the eletromagneti salar (cid:28)eld only

without the vetor (cid:28)eld.

Proof. Aording to the Lorentz-ondition

∂µAµ = 0 ⇔ ∂0A0 + ~∇ ~A = 0

It is

Aµ =

Φ
~A (cid:19)

to a (cid:29)ow of Φ into or out of the volume.

Hene, let us make the following asumptions: (1)

salar (cid:28)eld φ. (2) φ is quantized.
Proof (I. Statement). For a point harge φ ∼ 1
r .

The salar potential should weaken, if the seperation ds between its quanta

inreases. Therefore, we expet

bigger distanes from the ore. Hene, an eletron is a sink. By reverse

argumentation, a positron is a soure of eletromagneti salar (cid:28)eld quanta.

II.

Trivial, as nesessarily, these quanta represent the photons, as they

✷

reate the eletri (cid:28)eld via (2).

III. Charge-Charge interation.

(1) Eletron-Photon. The moving eletron is dragged towards to soure of

eletromagneti salar (cid:28)eld and vie versa.

Proof. This is a fat, just the image is di(cid:27)erent.

(2) Eletron-Eletron. The agglomeration of photons between the two soures

pushes them apart from eah other, the same way like two (cid:28)remen sitting on

movable hairs would seperate by direting their running waterguns towards

eah other.

(3) As the onentration of eletromagneti salar (cid:28)eld quanta between the

two sinks is lower than aside from them, they are dragged apart towards the

higher onentration, therefore seperate.

IV. Magnetism/Lorentz-fore.

~B = ~∇ × ~A and

~A is (cid:29)ow of eletromagneti salar (cid:28)eld quanta (see

Lemma in I). Therefore, we have a nonvanishing whirl of moving photons,

onstituting the magneti (cid:28)eld.

V. Lorentz-fore

(cid:28)eld Φ quanta onstitute the magneti (cid:28)eld.

RV

~B = ~∇ × ~A,

~F = q~v × ~B.

~A is a whirl of moving photons. An eletron is de(cid:29)eted downwards oming

rot

from the front, as it runs towards, where the most photons are oming from.

A positron is de(cid:29)eted upwards, as photons are oming slightly from below.

This is what the Maxwell equations say together with the Lorentz ondition

taken physially relevant.

Magnetism an therefore be redued to photon-harge interation in the

same way like harge-harge interation takes plae, lassially.

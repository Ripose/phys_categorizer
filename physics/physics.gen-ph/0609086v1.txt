Abstract.

The hypothesis of existence of oﬀ-site continuums is investigated. Principles
of the physical description are formulated. The structure of oﬀ-site continuums
and opportunities of observation of oﬀ-site physical objects from the continuum of
the observer is investigated. There are found conformities between properties of
the considered objects with properties of known physical objects and fundamental
interactions both in micro-, and macro-scales.

1. Introduction.

The general theory of relativity in itself generates the conservation laws – and not as a
consequence of ﬁeld equations, but as identities (E.Schr¨odinger [1]). Only from one fact
of the general invariance of the integral:

R d4x,

=

I

ZG

(1)

where R is some scalar density,

four identical ratios between Hamiltonian
derivatives of density R may be got, and these ratios follow such as conservation laws.
Integration in (1) is carried out on all “four-dimensional continuum”, thus meaning its
continuity and inﬁnity. E.Schr¨odinger [1] indirectly pointed out to the limitation of
such approach in physics to the description of the physical reality from the point of
view of mathematicians: “The physicist, however, has got used to consider, that the

certain letter (φ
His most important general reasoning concern to “the general frame of references”,
which he does not concretize and consequently should not actually change frequently
very much, though the principle of invariance relating to transformations is constantly
meant”. E.Schr¨odinger, however, did not go beyond this remark. What is this “general
frame of references”, for whom and how much is it “general”? Whether there are other
ones? And if yes, what consequences can it have from the point of view of physics?

2. Space-time continuums.

In the general theory of relativity the space-time topometry depends on physical objects
existing in this space-time (gravitating bodies, particles, ﬁelds). “It is necessary, strictly
speaking, to have a set of an inﬁnite number of the bodies ﬁlling all space, like some
“medium”. Such system of bodies together with connected to each of them arbitrarily
clocks is a frame of reference in the general theory of relativity” (L.Landau and E.Lifshitz
[2]). Such as “medium” not only ﬁlls the space, but also forms it by itself, we do not
have bases to deny the existence of other “medium” – the space, which can not adjoin
to ours, include it in itself or to be itself a part of our “medium”. Arguments, that if
we do not observe anything similar to such “mediums”, so it does not exist, or it is no
sense to consider, are not convincing, because a question, what could we observe in this
case, simply was never investigated. At least, the author does not know anything about
such investigations.

Uniqueness of a continuum is not a necessary condition from the point of view of
mathematics. It is declared in the mathematical theory of sets, that, for example, any
local area of continuous inﬁnite multidimensional space has the same power of set as
all that space in sense that it is possible to establish the point-to-point correspondence
between elements of the given sets. It is possible the situation at which the considered
continuum is a subset by itself of another continuum, and, on the contrary, can include
a number of other continuums. As the elementary example, let’s consider the functional
and
correspondences between two four-dimensional continuums
continuous and inﬁnite by each coordinate. So, they have

structure. This medium will diﬀer, generally speaking, from the medium generated by

L.Landau and E.Lifshitz [2] give the following physical interpretation of types of
elements of metric tensor: “It is necessary to emphasize a diﬀerence between sense of
a condition g00 > 0 and a condition of the certain signature (signs on principal values)
of the tensor gik. The tensor gik, not satisfying to the second one of these conditions,
cannot correspond to any real gravitational ﬁeld at all, i.e. the metrics of the real space-
time. Default of a condition g00 > 0 would mean only, that the corresponding frame
of references cannot be carried out by real bodies; if the condition on principal values
thus is carried out, it is possible to achieve that g00 becomes positive by appropriate
transformation of coordinates”.

G

G

The given interpretations are completely appropriate for physical interpretation
of space-time structure of introduced oﬀ-site continuums if to take into account, that
concepts of “real space-time” and “real bodies” are not determined by Landau, and to
apply our contents considered in Sect.2 to these concepts. We shall call this assumption
as a principle of observability of oﬀ-site continuums.

Thus, we consider, that gG′

where both previous conditions are not carried out. The observable time of an oﬀ-site
continuum in timeable areas can be determined from (3), assuming dxα = 0, α = 1, 2, 3:

It is clearly seen from the considered example, that the area of observation D of
the enclosed continuum in turn breaks up to three subareas (see Fig.1). In timeable
areas the types of metrics of local area of an oﬀ-site continuum and the area D of
a continuum of the observer coincide with each other and it is possible to establish
point-to-point correspondence between observable elements of oﬀ-site physical objects,
therefore these oﬀ-site physical objects can be detected locally in system of the observer.
The observation of oﬀ-site physical objects from spatial areas in system of the observer
can be extremely unusual because of discrepancy of metrics. In some particular cases it
may seem, that cause-eﬀect chains are broken in oﬀ-site continuums. In transitive area
it is possible the mixed perception of objects depending on conditions of observation.

Generally, observable elements of metric tensor depend on all coordinates xi in
system of the observer, so the internal structure of the enclosed continuum is not
static for the oﬀ-site observer. Furthermore, even if the area of observation of oﬀ-site
continuum D coincides with all space of the observer, physical objects and their images
may not coincide with each other. These conclusions were made for a special case of
functional transformation (3) corresponding to spatial rotations in works [3, 4]. Running
forward, we shall note, that there are restrictions on possible internal structures of the
enclosed continuums. In section 4 it will be shown, that the presence of the compact
self-consistent ﬁelds generated by the enclosed objects in area Df (shown on Fig.1) is

4. Physical objects of enclosed continuums.

The visual parameters of physical objects of oﬀ-site systems will be perceived by the
observer within the framework of his own continuum. Hence, following the analysis of
Sect.2 it will be quite logical to assume, that any physical objects (including also oﬀ-site
ones) should satisfy in a continuum of the observer to the conservation laws generated by
this continuum. We shall call this assumption as a principle of compatibility of oﬀ-site
continuums.

The observer registers the visual parameters of physical objects of the enclosed
continuum inside some limited area D

one p(xα, τ ), which averaged in time value should be equal to zero:

Oﬀ-site physical objects should manifest themselves somehow as some “inﬂuences”,
known ﬁelds in a system of the observer, diﬀerently it would not be any sense to examine
and try to describe them. On the other hand, according to a principle of compatibility,
they need to satisfy to conservation laws in the system of the observer. So, for example,
they cannot be an inﬁnite energy source in the system of the observer. There are two
opportunities to satisfy to this condition: to consider, that raised ﬁelds do not transfer
energy or that they are located in some limited space region in the system of the observer.
Let’s assume, that the oﬀ-site physical object described by function P (xα, τ ), in

In a concrete case of localization of the electromagnetic waves excited by sources
P (xα, τ )δ(S0), located on a surface S0 of some area D0 ⊂
D, sources should shield the
electromagnetic waves extending inside area D0 and carrying energy. The surface S0 can
be interpreted as an internal surface of the resonator. Conditions of reﬂection will be
equivalent to conditions of equality to zero on this surface of tangential components of
an electromagnetic ﬁeld. For many simple conﬁgurations of resonators the distributions
of electric and magnetic ﬁelds are well investigated. For each resonator, depending on
its design, there is a discrete set of resonant frequencies. In our case we interpret these
conditions as conditions of quantization of physical objects of the enclosed systems.

Let’s note, that electromagnetic ﬁelds, which components are normal to a surface
S0, can be not limited neither this surface, nor area D, that does not contradicts to
our principle of compatibility so as these ﬁelds do not transfer energy from area D0. In
other words, only such distributions of stable oﬀ-site objects are permitted at which the
ﬁelds excited by these objects in the continuum of the observer are not carrying away
the energy. Fields not carrying energy can be non-local, but their own energy should
be ﬁnite.

The energy conservation law in the system of the observer can be satisﬁed.
Necessary conditions of its realization will be conditions of quantization of observable
frequencies and sizes of physical objects of oﬀ-site systems. Therefore the aperiodical
component in (4) should be equal to zero and expression (4) for the enclosed oﬀ-site
objects coincides with the wave function, describing quantum mechanical objects.

In the given section the examples of solutions of the equations (5) with a source
function from a class of the generalized functions [5] were examined, that at all is not a
necessary condition. The analysis of the generalized functions allows to ﬁnd fundamental
solutions and to reveal the basic properties of the common solutions.

The Helmholtz equation gives the established solutions. The analysis of solutions of
the wave equation (5) shows, that in process of the enclosed object “occurrence” there
are formed also the physical objects “ﬂowing out of him” at the initial time moment
with speed of the excited waves. This process is shown on Fig.2 at one-dimensional case
for P (x, τ ) = [δ(x + 1) + δ(x

Thus, the oﬀ-site object can not irradiate the energy in a system of the observer,
if object’s spatial sizes and frequencies are quantized. The oﬀ-site object is surrounded
by the compact self-consistent electromagnetic ﬁelds locally excited by him in a system
D, emphasizing the fact, that
of the observer. On Fig.1 this area is shown as Df
the ﬁelds which are not carrying energy can leave far beyond areas D0 and D. The
occurence and the transition between stable states of the physical object is accompanied
by formation of “ﬂowing out” objects in a system of the observer.

⊃

The described observable properties of physical objects in micro-scale correspond
to properties of quantum-mechanical and quantum-physical objects. So, from the point
of view of the oﬀ-site observer, the enclosed object can have the central part like a
nucleus, surrounded with the compact self-consistent electromagnetic ﬁelds excited by
him. The central part, in turn, has the internal structure and in timeable areas the

A.Novikov-Borodin. Phys.Objects of Dark Systems

oﬀ-site physical objects can be observed locally in space and, so, can be identiﬁed in
a system of the observer. It means, that they can participate in “point” interactions
with other objects from the system of the observer. Spatial capturing or conﬁnement
of oﬀ-site physical objects from the timeable region (area 1, Fig.1) in the borders of the
observable region D will seem as the extremely unusual phenomenon. At the standard
ﬁeld interpretation, it is equivalent to the presence of some force holding these objects
inside the space area, and it will seem, that the quantity of this force grows at approach
to the border of this area. Analogies with the phenomenon of conﬁnement and strong
interactions are arising.

The compact self-consistent electromagnetic ﬁelds of the enclosed object will possess
explicit quantum properties for the observer. Quantization is a consequence of the self-
consistency, that is necessary for submitting to the energy conservation law in a system
of the observer. These ﬁelds are good candidates for a role of weak interactions. Such
interpretation is already conﬁrmed experimentally as a fact of equivalence of weak and
electromagnetic interactions at high energy levels.

If all functions of transformation of continuums (like in (3)) are limited, the
generalized observer should see the occurrence and disappearance in the limited area
of space of some objects. From the point of view of the analysis of the given section
it means, that the function of the enclosed object limited in time can be written as
P (xα, τ ) = P0(xα, τ )Θ(τ
τ ), where (T0, T1) is the time interval of existence
of the enclosed object in system of the oﬀ-site observer. Occurrence and disappearance of
physical object of oﬀ-site system will be connected to emission and absorption of quanta
of the ﬁeld excited by objects in system of the observer. Most likely, continuous process
of an exchange in similar quantums of some system of the oﬀ-site objects enclosed and
limited in time should be initiated. Generally speaking, it does not contradict to modern
representations of the internal structure of physical vacuum.

5. Physical objects of containing continuums.

In section 3 it was mentioned, that, most likely, there will be some speciﬁcity at the
description of parameters of oﬀ-site containing continuums, in comparison with enclosed
ones. Anyhow, physical objects of the enclosed continuums can be observed entirely
while only the limited area of a containing continuum is accessible to the oﬀ-site observer
from the enclosed continuum. Clearly, that the analysis of structure of an containing
continuum is possible only (if it is possible in general) with the help of extrapolation
of the observable data by additional physical assumptions. We shall try to receive the
maximum possible information without making the additional assumptions concerning
the structure of oﬀ-site continuums since the analysis of existing experimental data and
possible variants can leave far beyond the framework of one article.

Let’s try to imagine, how could the observer of the enclosed continuum see an
oﬀ-site continuum containing it. First of all, we shall note, that the observer of the
, generally speaking, can not perceive the limitation of his own
enclosed continuum

continuum on spatial and time coordinates in an oﬀ-site continuum

′. Arguing similarly to Section 3 we shall come to the conclusion, that
G
the area D′ from the point of view of a containing continuum can be shared into three
subareas: timeable, spatial and transitive, depending on concurrence of a kind of their
metrics. From other hand, their concurrence of metrics is the same for the observer of
the enclosed continuum. So, there will also be the corresponding timeable, spatial and
transitive areas in a containing continuum of the observer of the enclosed one. Clearly,
that seen parameters of oﬀ-site physical objects of a containing continuum from the
, from
enclosed system will depend on local position of the observer in these areas in
his local metrics. It will be possible to identify locally the oﬀ-site objects of containing
continuum with their images in enclosed one only from timeable areas of a continuum
of the observer.

G

There will be a fourth not observable area

′, distinct from D′ for the observer of
the enclosed continuum. Not observable area will be outside the observer’s continuum.
However, inﬂuences from physical objects of not observable area can be registered by
the observer, at least because they should inﬂuence space-time structure of area D′
and, hence, on seen parameters and movements of physical objects in this area. It is
also possible to observe the streams of the particles emitted by physical objects of not
observable area. These particles can penetrate the area D′, that can be perceived as the
streams of particles originating by an invisible source, from “empty” space of observer’s
continuum. All listed objects and processes marvelously well correspond to not clear
and rather speciﬁc objects found out in last years by astrophysicists – to “dark matter”,
“dark energy” [6]. Reports about the registration of intensive sources of particles from
“empty” areas of the universe have appeared also.

In Section 4 the ﬁelds induced by objects of the enclosed continuum in the
containing continuum were investigated. These ﬁelds exist in area D′ and also can
be registered by the observer of the enclosed continuum
, for example, as the stream
of particles penetrating all system of the oﬀ-site observer. These ﬁelds, as distinct from
considered above, have other nature and should correlate with the sizes (or the “age”
in the standard extended Universe model) of a continuum of the observer. Observed
streams of relic radiation are good candidates for this role.

G

From the analysis of the previous section it is also follows, that the observable
structure of our universe is (or in macro-time scale will aspire to) the structure of
stable physical object in a containing continuum. Unfortunately, telling the truth, at a
modern level of knowledge of astrophysical objects, it is not absolutely clear as far as
last information can be useful to us.

For completeness of a picture it is necessary to tell a few words about an opportunity
of existence and observation of oﬀ-site objects in some “average”, “human” scale, scale of
the observer. Really, if physical objects of oﬀ-site systems meet constantly in micro- and
macro-scales, they should be paid attention of researchers with their unusual properties
if existing in “average” scale.

Let’s consider such unusual and poorly investigated objects as ﬁreballs. As known,

A.Novikov-Borodin. Phys.Objects of Dark Systems

10

they are formed as a result of the high-energy electric discharge and very much remind
by external attributes to self-consistent compacts described above. It is completely not
necessary, that the compact is initiated by an oﬀ-site object. It can be initiated by the
system of sources of an electromagnetic ﬁeld excited by the electric discharge in some
environment. The ﬁreball disappears as a result of collision with macroobject or because
of gradual outﬂow of energy as a result of parasitic radiation because of heterogeneity
of environment. When internal energy of a ﬁreball reaches minimally possible value for
maintenance of the compact, it instantly collapses with the residuary energy liberation
of an electromagnetic ﬁeld. And, owing to discreteness of frequencies in the compact,
the character of external damages from such explosion often has strongly expressed wave
character.

From Section 4 it is known, that, according to a principle of compatibility, the
necessary attribute of stable oﬀ-site object are the stable compact self-consistent ﬁelds
around him. The self-consistent structure can be easily broken by more energetic
external inﬂuences – external ﬁelds or other objects as it occur in a case of a ﬁreball.
Thus, it is possible to assume, that the power density of containing system deﬁnes the
scale of observation of oﬀ-site enclosed objects.
In other words, the existence of the
high energetic oﬀ-site objects in micro-scale interferes with their stable existence at the
“average” scale.

Conclusion.

The hypothesis of feasible existence of oﬀ-site continuums was investigated in this paper.
The opportunities of experimental observation of oﬀ-site physical objects were examined.
It is appeared possible to describe the basic general observable properties of such objects
even without additional assumptions of existential structure of an oﬀ-site continuum,
being only based on known properties of a system of the observer.

In a micro-scale, the scale of the elementary particles, the described properties
of physical objects coincident with properties of quantum-mechanical and quantum-
physical objects. Quantization is the essential property of observable parameters of
physical objects of oﬀ-site systems and is a consequence of the energy conservation
law in a system of the observer. There are obvious correlations with weak and strong
interactions, the phenomenon of conﬁnement.

In a macro-scale, the scale of astrophysical objects, the appearance of oﬀ-site objects
is very similar to the inﬂuence found out in last years from “dark matter” and “dark
energy”. Analogies to known relic radiation are also looked through. Such sight can
appear useful at the investigation of actual problems of modern astrophysics.

The proposed hypothesis allows unifying relativistic and quantum-physical

approaches existing for today in modern physics in not contradicting system.

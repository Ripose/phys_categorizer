Abstract

If textbook Lorentz invariance is actually a property of the equations describing a sector
of matter above some critical distance scale, several sectors of matter with diﬀerent critical
speeds in vacuum can coexist and an absolute rest frame (the vacuum rest frame, possibly
related to the local rest frame of the expanding Universe) may exist without contradicting
the apparent Lorentz invariance felt by ”ordinary” particles (particles with critical speed
in vacuum equal to c , the speed of light). The real geometry of space-time will then be
diﬀerent from standard Lorentz invariance, and the Poincar´e relativity principle will be a
local (in space and time), approximate sectorial property. It seems natural to assume that
particles with critical speed in vacuum diﬀerent from c are superluminal.

We illustrate such a scenario using as an example a spinorial space-time where the
modulus of the spinor, associated to the time variable, is the size of an expanding Universe.
Several properties of superluminal particles, and of matter without a universal relativity
If the vacuum rest frame

is close to that suggested by the cosmic microwave background, experimental searches
for superluminal particles on earth should mainly contemplate a laboratory speed range
around 103 c , even for very high energy superluminal cosmic rays. The detectability of
several consequences of the new scenario is brieﬂy discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION

In recent papers [1-5] , we pointed out that the apparent Lorentz invariance of the
laws of physics does not imply that space-time is indeed minkowskian. Lorentz invariance
can be just a property of the equations describing a sector of matter above some critical
distance scale. Then, an absolute rest frame (possibly related to the local rest frame of the
expanding Universe) may exist without contradicting the apparent Lorentz invariance felt
by the particles we are made of. We suggested the possible existence of superluminal sectors
of matter, i.e. of particles with positive mass and energy but with a critical speed in vacuum
much higher than the speed of light c . Sectors of matter with diﬀerent critical speeds
in vacuum may coexist, just as in a perfectly transparent crystal it is possible to identify
at least two critical speeds: those of sound and light. Interaction between the ”ordinary”
sector, i.e. particles with critical speed in vacuum equal to c , and the superluminal sectors,
would break Lorentz invariance. But such interactions would be expected to be basically
very high-energy, short distance phenomena not incompatible with successful conventional
tets of Lorentz invariance. Several important physical and cosmological implications were
discussed in a scenario with several critical speeds for particles in vacuum.

Admitting the possible existence of several sectors of matter with diﬀerent critical
speeds in vacuum, some stringent form of grand-uniﬁed or primordial constituent back-
ground seems necessary in order to explain why so many diﬀerent particles (quarks, leptons,
gauge bosons...) have the same critical speed. This is in agreement with present ideas in
particle theory, and to some extent improves their formulation as it appears that grand
uniﬁcation and universality of the critical speed in vacuum may be expressions of a single
symmetry inside each sector. Our hypothesis extends the current approach, but does not
really contradict its basic philosophy. However, the superluminal particles we propose are
deﬁnitely not space-like states of the ordinary ones: they are a new kind of matter related
to new degrees of freedom not yet discovered experimentally.
If superluminal particles
exist, they may considerably modify the Big Bang scenario, provide most of the cosmic
(dark) matter, lead the evolution of the Universe, inﬂuence low-energy physics and be
produced at very high-energy accelerators (e.g. LHC) or found in experiments devoted to
high-energy cosmic rays (e.g. AMANDA [6]) where they can yield very speciﬁc signatures
allowing to detect events at extremely small rates (e.g. [5] , but see also Sect. 4).

In this note, we would like to discuss some possible implications of the new approach for
our description of space, time and elementary particles. As an example, a previously con-
sidered SU(2) spinorial space-time [4 , 5] will be chosen as the framework. If the structure
of space-time reﬂects basically the properties of matter at the scales under consideration,
it should to some extent account for the structure and evolution of the Universe, as well
as for phenomena like spin 1/2 which cannot be described in a natural way using conven-
tional space-time coordinates. In general relativity, the gravitational properties of matter
modify the local metric of space-time, but a much closer connection between matter and
space-time can be imagined incorporating deeper dynamical properties. Also, departure
from the Poincar´e relativity principle yields new fundamental physics (new particles and
interactions, motion ”backward in time” in some frames...), as will be discussed later.

2. THE SPINORIAL SPACE-TIME

Instead of four real numbers, we take space-time to be described by two complex
numbers, the components of a SU(2) spinor. From a spinor ξ , it is possible to extract a
SU(2) scalar, | ξ |2 = ξ†ξ (where the dagger stands for hermitic conjugate), and a vector
~z = ξ†~σξ , where ~σ is the vector formed by the Pauli matrices. In our previous papers on
the subject [4 , 5] , we proposed to interpret t = | ξ | as the time. If the spinor coordinates
are complex numbers, one has: z = t2 where z is the modulus of ~z . It does not seem
possible to interpret ~z as providing the space coordinates: one coordinate, corresponding
to an overall phase of the spinor, is missed by t and ~z . Therefore, a diﬀerent description
of space seems necessary in this approach.

Interpreting t as the time has at ﬁrst sight the drawback of positive-deﬁniteness and
breaking of time reversal, but this can be turned into an advantage if t is interpreted
as an absolute, cosmic time (geometrically expanding Universe). An arrow of time is
then naturally set, and space-time geometry incorporates the physical phenomenon of an
expanding Universe. As space translations and rotations are by deﬁnition transformations
leaving time invariant, the space coordinates should be built by considering the polar
coordinates in the hypersphere (i.e. the spherical hypersurface) of constant time, | ξ | =
t0 where t0 is a value of time [4 , 5]. On this hypersphere, a point ξ can be decribed as:

ξ = Uξ0

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where U is a SU(2) transformation and ξ0 a constant spinor (hereafter identiﬁed with the
observer position) on the sphere t = t0 . Writing:

U = exp (i/2 t−1

0 ~σ.~x) ≡ U(~x)

the vector ~x , with 0 ≤ x (modulus of ~x) ≤ 2πt0 , can be interpreted as the position vector
at constant time t0 . It is unique, except for a 2π rotation (x = 2πt0 , U = − 1). The
natural metric is dr2(~x , ~dx) = ( ~dx∗)2 , where ~dx∗ is deﬁned by:

U(~x + ~dx) = U( ~dx∗) U(~x)

or, in terms of exponentials:

leading at inﬁnitesimal level to:

exp [i/2 t−1

0 ~σ.(~x + ~dx)] = exp (i/2 t−1

0 ~σ. ~dx∗) exp (i/2 t−1

0 ~σ.~x)

~dx∗ = ~dxL + 2t0 [cos (t−1

0 x/2) sin (t−1

0 x/2) x−1 ~dx⊥ − sin2 (t−1

0 x/2) x−2 ~x ∧ ~dx] (5)

where ~dxL = x−2 (~x. ~dx) ~x and ~dx⊥ = ~dx − ~dxL . From (5), we consistently recover
~dx∗(x = 0) = ~dx , whereas ~dx∗(x = 2πt0) = ~dxL . Any closed path of the form:
U(α~u) = exp (i/2 αt−1
~σ.~u) from α = −2πt0 to α = 2πt0 , where ~u is a unitary
0
three-dimensional real vector, deﬁnes a geodesic on the hypersphere and on SU(2) . The
local volume element at ξ is d3 ~x∗ = dx∗
2dx∗

1dx∗

3 .

It is obvious that, under a SU(2) transformation V , U transforms into V UV −1 (the
vector representation) if ~σ.~x transforms into V ~σ.~x V −1 (the vector linear representation).
The vector ~v obtained from the equation V = exp (i/2 ~σ.~v) deﬁnes the rotation axis
and angle in correspondence with SO(3) rotations. ~x provides the space coordinates and
transforms like a SO(3) real vector, but being a SU(2) parameter it varies on a spherical
volume of radius 2πt0 , x ≤ 2πt0 , whose surface is identiﬁed to a single point. Under the
rotation deﬁned by V , ~x transforms into RV ~x = ~xL + cos v ~x⊥ + v−1 sin v ~x ∧ ~v ,
where ~xL = v−2 (~x.~v) ~v and ~x⊥ = ~x − ~xL , as it should be the case for a genuine space
rotation. The observer can thus feel a vector space in a spinorial space-time.

The cosmic time scale given by the radius of the Universe does not correspond to
the local time scale of physical processes at time t , which depends on the local vacuum
dynamics and varies with cosmic time. In situations where the Universe evolves smoothly,
we can identify both time scales up to a constant to be determined locally. Whatever
the relation between the two time scales, the above example (which requires by itself
uniﬁcation of space and time) clearly shows that abandoning textbook relativity dogmas
does not necessarily destroy the standard cosmological framework.

3. SPACE-TIME SYMMETRIES AND WAVE FUNCTIONS

On a three-dimensional vector representation, a 2π rotation is equal to the identity,
contrary to spinor representations of SU(2) where the same transformation changes the
sign of the spinors. The description of particles with half-integer spin in a real space-time
has always posed some conceptual problems, in the sense that a spinor wave function
cannot be built by standard operations from representations of the space rotation group.
More precisely, a particle with half-integer spin cannot be described by a single-valued
function of the standard space and time variables. To circumvent this diﬃculty, it is said
that spinors do not form representations of the basic symmetry group SO(3) of space but
of the covering group SU(2) of its Lie algebra, or that they belong to representations of
the rotation group ”up to a sign”. The same situation arises in a relativistic description,
where SL(2 , C) is the covering group of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group which, when
complexiﬁed, is equivalent to that of SL(2 , C)lef t ⊗ SL(2 , C)right (for ”left” and ”right”
chiral spaces). Our spinorial space-time naturally provides a more compact description:
position in the spinor space-time is described by a spinor whereas, simultaneously and
independently of whether relativity applies, position in the | ξ | = t0 hypersphere (the
”space” at time t = t0) is described by a vector. Spinor ﬁelds become then single-valued
functions of space-time coordinates. It seems worth emphasizing again that, even without
relativity, our approach requires and operates a geometric uniﬁcation of space and time.

At ﬁxed t0 , the position vector ~x describes the relative position of the point ξ with
respect to an observer placed at ξ0 . The space coordinates are the parameters of the
(unique) element U of SU(2) which transforms ξ0 into ξ . Contrary to the conventional
description of space rotations, no SU(2) transformation other than the identity leaves the
observer position unchanged, but the observer can measure only the relative position of
surrounding objects. A 2π rotation would change the signs of ξ0 and ξ simultaneously.

4

It forms with the identity the center of the group and cannot be felt by any position
measurement (the observer is by deﬁnition insensitive to its own motion), although the
properties of spin-1/2 particles can be checked by other experiments. Therefore, in our
approach, a space rotation around an axis passing through the observer position is a SU(2)
transformation whose eﬀects cannot be entirely seen through position measurements. If V
is the SU(2) transformation, all the points in the spinor space of the form ξ = V λ ξ0 ,
where λ is a real number between −2πv−1 and 2πv−1 , appear unchanged to the observer
when V acts on the spinor space-time. However, V actually changes all these points
(they move along the rotation axis) and preserves only the overall geodesic on the ξ = t0
hypersphere. Space rotations signiﬁcantly transform the whole Universe, and can deplace
the observer at cosmic scales. While space rotations correspond to SU(2) transformations,
space translations correspond to a change in the position of the observer on the ξ = t0
hypersphere. Moving the observer from ξ0 to ξ′
0 = W ξ0 changes the above deﬁned U into
UW −1 and, writing W = exp (−i/2 t−1
0 ~σ.~w) , ~σ.~x is changed into −2it0 ln (UW −1) ,
where ln stands for neperian logarithm uniquely deﬁned, for U 6= − W , in the range
of traceless hermitic 2 × 2 matrices with eigenvalues ±λ such that | λ | < 2πt0 . In
the ”local” limit x/t0 ≪ 1 and w/t0 ≪ 1 , the expression −2it0 ln (UW −1) can be
approximated by ~σ.(~x + ~w). Space translations commute in the inﬁnitesimal limit where
the structure of the Lie algebra (providing the cosmic curvature) can be ignored. The usual
parametrization of space transformations is a local one, based on our intuitive, inﬁnitesimal
view of the tangent hyperplane to the ξ = t0 hypersphere at the observer position.

Contrary to space translations, space-time translations deﬁned using spinorial coordi-
nates are real translations which commute but which cannot leave invariant any | ξ | =
constant hypersphere. We expect them to make sense locally, at scales much smaller than
the size of the Universe. The generators of such translations are SU(2) spinors, and so
is the space-time position spinor ∆ξ = ξ − ξ0 of any point of space-time with respect to
an observer placed at ξ0 . Supersymmetry could possibly be connected to derivation with
respect to the spinorial coordinates, but we shall not discuss this point in the present work.

Because of the expansion of the space hypersphere, we do not really expect invariance
under time translations (energy conservation) to hold at cosmic scale, even if it can be a
good local symmetry in the inﬁnitesimal limit ∆t ≪ t where our intuition suggests energy
conservation to be a basic law of Nature. Similar considerations apply to discrete time
symmetries, such as T and CP T (no longer protected by a universal Lorentz invariance),
as the two directions of time are clearly inequivalent at cosmic scale. As will be seen later,
we expect the cosmological redshift and time dilation to apply as in standard cosmology.

Up to a n-dependent normalization factor, and taking the above d3 ~x∗ as the volume

element, an example of spinor wave function at time t could be, for integer n ≥ 0 :

and, for integer n ≤ 0 :

ψn(ξ) = t−3/2 (ψ†

0 U ψ0)n ψ0

ψ−n (ξ) = t−3/2 (ψ†

0 U † ψ0)n ψ0

5

(6)

(7)

where ξ0 is the observer position at time t , ψ0 = ψ (ξ0) is the value of the spinor wave
function at ξ0 and U is the operator uniquely deﬁned by equation (1) , tranforming ξ0
into ξ . The quantization of n is required by the regularity of the wave function at zero
values of the matrix elements ψ†
0 U ψ0 . In realistic quantum-mechanical situations, n is
a very large number in order to make the wave function oscillate at small wavelengths.
The function deﬁned by the n-th power of the n = 1 wave function ψ†
0 U ψ0 , or by its
complex conjugate, is then close to a plane wave, as can be seen in what follows.

From the parametrization (1) , we can replace ξ by its space coordinate vector ~x and
write for a spinor wave function ψ = ψ (~x , t). Let us the consider the case where ψ0
is an eigenspinor of ~σ.~x , and set a coordinate system where ~x = (x , 0 , 0) . Then, if
0 U ψ0 = exp (it−1x/2) . If,
σ1 is taken to be diagonal and σ1 ψ0 = ψ0 , one has ψ†
0 U ψ0 ≃ exp (it−1x1/2).
instead, ~x = (x1 , x2 , x3) , and if x2 , x3 ≪ t , one has ψ†
In both cases, the wave function can be approximated by a plane wave with wave vector
(t−1/2 , 0 , 0). Similarly, the n-th power of the matrix element will be a plane wave with
momentum (nt−1/2 , 0 , 0) and can be approximated by exp (i n t−1 x1/2) as long as
n (x2 − x2
1) ≪ t2 . The above considered translation W , acting on the spinor wave
functions, will turn U into UW −1 . It will, to leading order, transform ~x into ~x + ~w and
the wave function ψn ∝ exp (i n t−1 x1/2) into ψ′
n ∝ exp [i n t−1 (x1 + w1)/2] as long
1) ≪ t2 . On an arbitrary spinor wave function ψn (and similarly for
as n (w2 − w2
ψ−n via complex conjugation), of the form (6) , the generators of space translations are
the matrices in/2 σj t−1 (j = 1 , 2 , 3) multiplying U at right inside the matrix element
0Uψ0 . Taking t ≈ 1026 m for cosmic time, the above wave function can be approximated
ψ†
<∼ 1026 m k−1
L where kL = nt−1/2 is the longitudinal
by a plane wave for x2
wave vector scale. If n ≈ 1045 and k−1
L ≈ 10−19 m (the lowest distance scale accessible to
<∼ 1 Km
experiments at T eV energies), the plane wave approximation holds for | x⊥ |
(gaussian damping). If n ≈ 1061 and k−1
L ≈ 10−35 m , the approximation is valid for
| x⊥ | <∼ 10−5 m . Assuming that this transverse damping of quantum wave functions at
high wavelength is to be taken seriously, it is not clear whether feasible experiments can
eventually measure such an eﬀect related to the possible ﬁnite radius of the Universe.

⊥ = x2 − x2

If ψ0 is an eigenspinor of σ1 with eigenvalue s (necessarily 1 or -1), and with the
same approximations as before, ψn will be a momentum eigenstate with wave vector ~k of
components (nst−1/2 , 0 , 0). It will therefore, with the same approximations, satisfy the
equation:

~σ.~k | ψn > = s k n | n |−1

| ψ > = λ k | ψn >

(8)

where λ = s n | n |−1 is the helicity, with n taking integer values from (6) and (7).

4. EQUATIONS OF MOTION

In the present geometric approach, a natural cosmic time is given by the size of the
Universe. If radial directions from the point ξ = 0 deﬁne the arrow of time and the motion
of an absolute local rest frame (the ”vacuum rest frame”), it appears from continuity and
from quantization due to the compactness of three-dimensional space, e.g. in (6) , that the

6

wave vector ~k of a quantum particle must evolve in time like t−1 , generating a geometric
shift of wavelengths due to the expansion of the Universe. This is not surprising, as it
just corresponds to the geometric version of the standard cosmological redshift. Since
our cosmic time t is identical to the radius of the Universe, we immediately recover the
well-known expression (e.g. [7]):

λoλ−1

e

= aoa−1

e

(9)

where λo is the observed wavelength of the particle at the time of its detection, ao the
expansion parameter of the Universe at detection time, λe the emission wavelength and ae
the value of the expansion parameter at the time of emission of the particle. The recession
rate, given by Hubble’s constant, is very small as compared to laboratory time scales. In
the rest of the chapter, we will restrict ourselves to local phenomena and ignore eﬀects
related: a) to time evolution at cosmic scale; b) to the curvature of space at large scales.
In a global description, the speed ~v = d~x/dt should be replaced by ~v∗ = ~dx∗/dt , and the
gradient with respect to ~dx by a gradient with respect to ~dx∗ . Unless otherwise stated,
we consider in what follows the limit where the Universe is very large as compared to local
space and time scales for laboratory phenomena, and therefore we approximate the wave
vector spectrum by a continuum spectrum.

4a. Classical mechanics and kinematics

To illustrate classical mechanics with superluminal particles, assume a system of N in-
teracting particles in the vacuum rest frame with: a) diﬀerent critical speeds c1 , c2 , ... , cN
associated to diﬀerent sectorial Lorentz invariances; b) the following lagrangian in the local
rest frame of vacuum:

L = − ΣN

i=1 mi c2

i (1 − v2

i c−2

i )1/2 − U( ~x1 , ~x2 , ... , ~xN)

(10)

where: a) vi is the modulus of ~vi ; b) the vectors ~vi and ~xi stand for the speed and
position of particle i ; c) mi is the inertial mass of particle i ; d) U is a potential energy
describing the interaction, where we ignore large scale geometric eﬀects related to the space
coordinates. This lagrangian implies that all sectorial Lorentz invariances (i.e. all sectorial
Lorentz metrics in their canonical diagonal form) can be simultaneously exhibited in a
single rest frame, the ”absolute” or ”vacuum” rest frame. More complicate scenarios can
be imagined. Standard use of the variational principle leads from (10) to the equations of
motion (i = 1 , 2 , ... , N):

where ~∇i means partial gradient with respect to the position of the i-th particle and:

As in standard mechanics, momentum conservation holds:

d/dt ~pi = − ~∇i U

~pi = m ~vi (1 − v2

i=1 ~pi) = 0

(11)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(18)

and energy conservation is expressed by the formula:

d/dt (ΣN

i=1 ~pi. ~vi − L ) = d/dt (ΣN

i=1 p0

i ci + U) = 0

where:

i = Eic−1
p0

i

= mici (1 − v2

i c−2

i )−1/2

i=1 p0

and Ei is the non-interacting (i.e. rest + kinetic) energy of particle i . E = ΣN
i ci + U
is the total energy of the system. The 4-vectors (p0
, ~pi) transform covariantly under
i
Lorentz tranformations with critical speed parameter ci . However, the conservation laws
involving several sectors with diﬀerent values of the ci’s are not covariant and therefore can
be written in the above form only in the vacuum rest frame. ”Lorentz” transformations to
other inertial frames will depend on the matter the observer is made of. Since we expect
to measure the energy of superluminal particles through interactions with ”ordinary” par-
ticles, we can deﬁne, in the rest frame of an ”ordinary” particle moving at speed ~V with
respect to the vacuum rest frame, the energy and momentum of a superluminal particle
to be the Lorentz-tranformed of its vacuum rest frame energy and momentum taking c as
the critical speed parameter for the Lorentz transformation. Then, the mass of the super-
luminal particle will depend on the inertial frame. The energy and momentum of particle
i in the new rest frame, as measured by ordinary matter from energy and momentum
conservation (e.g. in decays of superluminal particles into ordinary ones), will be:

i = (Ei − ~V. ~pi) (1 − V 2c−2)−1/2
E′

i = ~p′
~p′

i,L + ~p′

i,⊥

i,L = ( ~pi,L − Ei c−2 ~V) (1 − V 2c−2)−1/2
~p′

~p′
i,⊥ = ~pi,⊥
where ~pi,L = V −2 ( ~V. ~pi) ~V , ~pi,⊥ = ~pi − ~pi,L and similarly for the longitudinal
and transverse components of ~p′
i . We are thus led to consider the eﬀective squared mass:

(19)

M 2

i,c = c−4 (E2

i − c2p2

i ) = m2

i c−4c4

i + c−2(c−2c2

i − 1) p2

i

(20)

which depends on the vacuum rest frame momentum of the particle. mi is the invariant
mass of particle i , as seen by matter from the i-th superluminal sector (i.e. with critical
speed in vacuum = ci). While ”ordinary” transformation laws of energy and momentum
are not singular, even for a superluminal particle, the situation is diﬀerent for the trans-
formation of a superluminal speed, as will be seen below. Furthermore, a mathematical
surprise arises: assume ~vi = ~V , so that particle i is at rest in the new inertial rest frame.
Then, we would naively expect a vanishing momentum, ~p′

i = 0 . Instead, we get:

i = − ~pi (c−2c2
~p′

i − 1) (1 − V 2c−2)−1/2

(21)

i ≫ pi , although p′

and p′
i if V ≪ c . This reﬂects the non-covariant character of
the 4-momentum of particle i under ”ordinary” Lorentz transformations. Thus, even if the
directional eﬀect is small in realistic situations (f.i. on earth), the decay of a superluminal

ic ≪ E′

8

particle at rest into ordinary particles will not lead to an exactly vanishing total momentum
if the inertial frame is diﬀerent from the vacuum rest frame.

In the rest frame of an ”ordinary” particle moving with speed ~V with respect to the

vacuum rest frame, we can estimate the speed ~v′

i of the previous particle i writing:

~vi = ~vi,L + ~vi,⊥

(22)

(23)

where ~vi,L = V −2( ~V. ~vi) ~V ,
transverse components of ~v′

~vi,⊥ = ~vi − ~vi,L and similarly for the longitudinal and

i . Then, the transformation law is:

i,L = ( ~vi,L − ~V) (1 − ~vi. ~V c−2)−1
~v′

(24)

i,⊥ = ~vi,⊥ (1 − V 2c−2)1/2 (1 − ~vi. ~V c−2)−1
~v′
leading to singularities at ~vi. ~V = c2 which correspond to a change in the arrow of
time (due to the Lorentz transformation of space and time with respect to the ”absolute”
rest frame) as seen by ordinary matter traveling at speed ~V with respect to the vacuum
rest frame. At vi,L > c2V −1 , a superluminal particle moving forward in time in the
vacuum rest frame will appear as moving backward in time to an observer made of ordinary
matter and moving at speed ~V in the same frame. On earth, taking V ≈ 10−3 c
(if the vacuum rest frame is close to that suggested by cosmic background radiation,
[7]), the apparent reversal of the time arrow will occur mainly at vi ≈ 103 c . If
e.g.
ci ≫ 103 c , phenomena related to propagation backward in time of produced superluminal
particles may be observable in future accelerator experiments slightly above the production
threshold. In a typical event where a pair of superluminal particles would be produced, we
expect in most cases that one of the superluminal particles propagates forward in time and
the other one propagates backward. It must be noticed that, according to (16 - 19), the
inﬁnite velocity (value of v′
i) associated to the point of time reversal does not correspond to
inﬁnite values of energy and momentum. The backward propagation in time, as observed
by devices which are not at rest in the vacuum rest frame, is not really physical (the arrow
of time is well deﬁned in the vacuum rest frame for all physical processes) and does not
correspond to any real violation of causality (see also Subsection 4d). The apparent reversal
of the time arrow for superluminal particles at ~vi. ~V > c2 would be a consequence of the
bias of the laboratory time measurement due to our motion with respect to the absolute
rest frame. The distribution and properties of such events, in an accelerator experiment or
in a large volume cosmic ray detector, would obviously be in correlation with the direction
and speed of the laboratory’s motion with respect to the absolute rest frame and provide
fundamental cosmological information, complementary to cosmic microwave background.

From (23) and (24), we also notice that, for V ≪ c and ~vi. ~V ≫ c2 , the speed ~v′
i

tends to the limit ~vi

∞ , where:

~vi

∞ ( ~vi) = − ~vi c2 ( ~vi. ~V)−1

(25)

which sets a universal high-energy limit, independent of ci , to the speed of superluminal
particles as measured by ordinary matter in an inertial rest frame other than the vacuum

9

∞ on earth is ~vi

rest frame. This limit is not isotropic, and depends on the angle between the speeds ~vi and
∞ ≈ 103 c if the vacuum rest frame
~V . A typical order of magnitude for ~vi
is close to that suggested by cosmic background radiation. If C is the highest critical speed
in vacuum, inﬁnite speed and reversal of the arrow of time occur only in frames moving
with respect to the vacuum rest frame at speed V ≥ c2C −1 . Finite critical speeds
of superluminal sectors, as measured by ordinary matter in frames moving at V 6= 0 ,
are anisotropic. Therefore, directional detection of superluminal particles would allow to
directly identify the eﬀective vacuum rest frame for each superluminal sector.

4b. Non-covariance of dynamics

Interaction between particles from diﬀerent dynamical sectors is, for simple physical
reasons, expected to depend on the rest frame of the system. For instance, Lorentz con-
traction has an intrinsic physical meaning in the vacuum rest frame and, at equal speed,
is diﬀerent for particles from diﬀerent dynamical sectors. Therefore, the relative size of
two such particles moving with the same speed will depend on their motion with respect
to the absolute rest frame. This should in principle inﬂuence their interaction properties.

Assuming that the above particles can be dealt with as spherical extended objects of
radius ri , and neglecting spin, we can as an example attribute to particle i , with position
~xi and moving at speed ~vi , a form factor depending on ~x − ~xi:

Fi (~x , ~xi , t) = fi [( ~xL − ~xi,L − ~vi t)2 r−2

i

(1 − v2

i ( ~vi. ~xi) ~vi

where ~xi,L = v−2
~xi,⊥ = ~xi − ~xi,L and similarly for the longitudinal and
transverse components of ~x with respect to the direction of ~vi . Taking as before ~V = ~vi ,
we ﬁnd under an ”ordinary” Lorentz transformation with relative speed ~V the transformed
form factor F ′

i (~x′ , ~x′ , t′) given by:

i = fi [(~x′

Where ~x′ and ~x′
i are the Lorentz-transformed coordinates and their longitudinal and trans-
verse components with respect to the direction of ~V are deﬁned in the same way as before.
The relative longitudinal size li l−1
, where l0 and li are respectively the length of an or-
dinary particle and of particle i taken to be at rest in the vacuum rest frame, turns under
the above Lorentz transformation into li l−1
i )1/2 in the new
intertial frame if, in both frames, the length is measured in the direction of ~V . When
V → c , the longitudinal size of a superluminal particle, as measured by ordinary mat-
ter, will tend to inﬁnity: the ordinary particles become inﬁnitely thin in the longitudinal
direction, as compared to the superluminal ones. Dynamics should be sensitive to this
contraction, which reﬂects the interaction of moving particles with the vacuum.

(35)

and we can associate to (10) the quantum lagrangian:

L = ΣN

i=1 Li,f ree + Lint

where Lint is the interaction lagrangian. Each sectorial free lagrangian density Li is a
scalar with respect to Lorentz transformations with ci as the critical speed parameter, but
not with respect to other Lorentz transformations. In spite of the loss of universal Lorentz
covariance, there seems to be no obvious eﬀect tending to spoil the consistency of the
quantum ﬁeld theory involving superluminal particles (see also Subsection 4d).

4c. Quantum wave equations

In the previous subsection, we considered the situation where, in the vacuum rest frame,
all free quantum particles satisfy Klein-Gordon equations with ci as the critical speed
parameter for particle i . This was inspired by our knowledge of ”ordinary” particles. But
we can also address the following question: what is the most general local wave equation for
a particle in the Universe we just described? Assuming that the SU(2) invariant equations
of motion are linear in the wave function φ and can be formulated locally in the absolute

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

(36)

11

local rest frame in terms of ﬁrst and second-order derivatives, a free particle wave function
at time t = t0 will satisfy in the vacuum rest frame the equation:

− A ∂2φ/∂t2 + iB∂φ/∂t + Σ3

j=1∂2φ/∂x2

j − D φ = 0

(37)

where A , B and D are functions of t and the xj are the real coordinates of the position
vector ~x . As long as eﬀects at cosmic scale can be ignored, we can to a ﬁrst approximation
assume that A , B and D have constant values and neglect the large scale time evolution
of frequencies and wave vectors due to the cosmological redshift. In such a scenario, if B
and D can be neglected, the cosmological redshift implies as in [7] that the emitted and
observed frequencies νe and νo of radiation will be related by the equation:

νo ao = νe ae

(38)

which also applies to proper rates of events (time dilation). Thus, our scenario is close
to the natural predictions of standard cosmology. If B and D do not vanish (they give
the mass and rest energy of the particle), the dependence on cosmic time of BA−1 and
DA−1 may be a nontrivial problem. A can be set constant by local time rescaling, which
implicitly modiﬁes the local time scale to describe the evolution of the Universe.

In the case (forbidden by Lorentz invariance) where B 6= 0 , equation (37) is not
self-conjugate. Assuming, for simplicity, that φ is a scalar, its complex conjugate φ∗ will
satisfy in the vacuum rest frame the wave equation:

− A ∂2φ∗/∂t2 − iB∂φ∗/∂t + Σ3

j=1∂2φ∗/∂x2

j − D φ∗ = 0

(39)

In terms of energy and momentum, the solutions of equation (37) are:

E = (4π)−1h A−1 [B + (B2 + 4Ak2 + 4AD)1/2]

(solution 1)

(40)

E = (4π)−1h A−1 [B − (B2 + 4Ak2 + 4AD)1/2]

(solution 2)

(41)

whereas equation (39) admits the solutions:

E = (4π)−1h A−1 [−B + (B2 + 4Ak2 + 4AD)1/2]

(solution 3)

(42)

E = (4π)−1h A−1 [−B − (B2 + 4Ak2 + 4AD)1/2]

(solution 4)

(43)

where, as usual, ~p = h (2π)−1 ~k and ~k is the wave vector. The speed of the particle is:

where Ev = C (p2 + m2C2)1/2 , C = A−1/2 , m = (4π)−1 h (B2 + 4DC−2)1/2 and,
solving the equations in ~p , we get the standard relativitic expression:

(44)

(45)

Then, with respect to Lorentz transformations with critical speed parameter C , the
energy is a linear combination of: a) a Lorentz scalar, given by the term Es = ±

~v = ~∇~p E = ~p C2 E−1

v

~p = m ~v (1 − v2C−2)−1/2

12

(4π)−1 h BA−1 in (40 - 43); b) the time component of a four-vector, given in (40 - 43)
by the term Ev = ± (4π)−1 h A−1 (B2 + 4Ak2 + 4AD)1/2 . The rest energy and
the inertial mass times the square of the critical speed, which are identical in the case of
standard relativity, are diﬀerent in the present case. Assuming D > 0 , and following
standard procedures of ﬁeld theory (e.g.
[8]), we may consider associating to solutions 1
- 4 in (40 - 43) two scalar ﬁelds describing neutral particles: a ﬁeld Φ1 for solutions (1)
and (4) and a ﬁeld Φ2 for solutions (2) and (3). But none of such ﬁelds would satisfy a
second-order wave equation like (37) or (39). Instead, we may attempt to build a ﬁeld Φ
associated to solutions (1) and (2) and satisfying equation (37). Its conjugate Φ† would
then correspond to solutions (3) and (4) and satisfy equation (39). In expressions of the
same type as (30) and (32), the volume element (k0)−1 d3~k should use instead of k0 its
four-vector component k0
s = ± BA−1/2,
whereas the exponential exp [i (~k.~x − k0Ct)] should use for k0 the expression k0 = k0
s + k0
v
. This seems to be the right choice of quantum ﬁelds. In this case: a) there would be no
symmetry between positive and negative energy solutions inside each ﬁeld; b) particle and
antiparticle would have the same inertial mass, but not the same rest energy. But it would
be possible to derive equations (37) and (39) from a free lagrangian density L in terms of
Φ and Φ† writing:

v = (k2 + m2C2)1/2 ignoring the scalar term k0

L = − (4π)−1 h C (L0 + iρ Lρ)

(46)

where:

L0 = m2C2 (h/2π)−2 Φ† Φ − C−2 ∂Φ†/∂t ∂Φ∂t + ~∇Φ†.~∇Φ
Lρ = Φ† ∂Φ/∂t − ∂Φ†/∂t Φ
ρ = B/2 and Lρ is basically a charge operator accounting, in the lagrangian, for the
diﬀerence in rest energy between the particle described by Φ and its antiparticle. Obviously,
a term proportional to a charge in the lagrangian indicates the existence of a constant
potential (a scalar with respect to space rotations, like the electric potential) in the vacuum
rest frame. This in turn indicates that an eﬀective charge has condensed in vacuum, and
that this charge has locally the same motion as the vacuum rest frame.

(47)

(48)

Similar considerations apply to fermions. Going back to Section 3 , we can assume that
the spinor wave function | ψn > is locally approximated by a plane wave and, neglecting
the cosmological redshift, satisﬁes in the vacuum rest frame the equation:

d/dt | ψn > = − i en | ψn >

(49)

which has solution:

ψn (~x , t) = exp [−ien(t − t0)] ψn (~x , t0) = exp [−ien(t − t0) + i~k.~x] ψ0

(50)

with group velocity ~v ≃ 4π h−1 s (en − en−1) t ~k/k . If the n-dependence of en n−1 can
be neglected (massless case), the constant 2πh−1 enk−1 is the critical speed of the particle
in vacuum and the helicity is equivalent to chirality. If we apply equations (37) and (39)
to the spinor wave function, we get similar solutions for energy in terms of momentum.
But we can also linearize the equations introducing the real constants α , δ and ǫ , and
writing for (37):

(αk0 + ~σ.~k + δ) ψ1 + ǫ ψ2 = 0

(51)

13

[(αk0 + δ)2 − k2 − ǫ2] ψ1 = [(αk0 + δ)2 − k2 − ǫ2] ψ2 = 0

(53)

(αk0 − ~σ.~k + δ) ψ2 + ǫ ψ1 = 0

(αk0 + ~σ.~k − δ) ψ∗
(αk0 − ~σ.~k − δ) ψ∗

1 + ǫ ψ∗
2 + ǫ ψ∗

2 = 0

1 = 0

(52)

(54)

(55)

which lead to:

and, for (39):

leading to:

[(αk0 − δ)2 − k2 − ǫ2] ψ∗

1 = [(αk0 − δ)2 − k2 − ǫ2] ψ∗

2 = 0

(56)

We are thus led to a pair of complex-conjugate generalized Dirac equations where, in

the chiral representation, a constant term has been added to the Dirac operator.

The above discussion points at a possible intrinsic breaking of Lorentz invariance, and
of the symmetry between particles and antiparticles, that can be explored experimentally
even if the eﬀect is very small. If such a phenomenon happens, and even if it occurs only in
a superluminal sector, it can naturally be at the origin of the asymmetry between matter
and antimatter in the Universe. A relevant question is how universal would be (if it exists)
the value of B inside a given sector. Experiment seems to indicate that A is universal
inside the ordinary sector, whereas the eﬀective value of D varies considerably for reasons
that may be due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Lacking a more detailed dynamical
description of the phenomenon, we leave this question open.

4d. Causality, spin and statistics

If the number of sectors is ﬁnite and all critical speeds are ﬁnite, causality is not violated
but adapted to the existence of several critical speeds in vacuum. It holds explicitly in the
vacuum rest frame, where no signal can propagate faster than the highest critical speed
C .
If the interaction between sectors with diﬀerent critical speed in vacuum is weak,
we expect by continuity the usual spin-statistics connection to hold, as it holds in the
limit where diﬀerent sectors would not interact. Then, the standard arguments for the
spin-statistics connection [9] remain valid with similar assumptions generalized to the new
situation. As stressed by many authors (e.g.
[10]), causality is the only known principle
allowing nowadays to demonstrate the observed relation between spin and statistics.

Even with the breaking of Lorentz invariances due to interaction between diﬀerent sec-
tors, the existence of a maximum critical speed in the vacuum rest frame and the causality
condition with respect to C in this frame, are enough to enforce the standard connexion
between spin and statistics for all sectors (the ordinary sector and the superluminal ones).
For instance, as discussed in [10], if the canonical quantization for bosons is applied to
fermions, the commutator between a free Dirac fermion ﬁeld at (t , ~x) and its hermitic
conjugate at (t′ , ~x′) is given by a Dirac operator acting on the integral:

∆1,i(t , ~x ; t′ , ~x′) = (2π)−3

(2k0)−1 d3~k cos[k0 ci (t − t′) − ~k.(~x − ~x′)]

(57)

Z

14

where it can be seen that the function ∆1,i(t , ~x ; t′ , ~x′) and its derivatives do not vanish
at t = t′, ~x 6= ~x′ . Therefore, the incompatibility between causality and the ”wrong”
statistics remains. Similarly, the compatibility between the ”right” statistics and causality
survives if causality is understood as being valid in the vacuum rest frame with respect to
the highest critical speed C , as common sense suggests.

5. SOME EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

For obvious reasons, the above analysis (which is far from exhausting the basic the-
oretical problems) was necessary before considering any possible experimental search for
superluminal particles. Experimental implications of the present study will be discussed
in detail in a forthcoming paper but, from the above discussion, it clearly appears that
they are important and that several eﬀects of superluminal sectors may be measurable in
future experiments. Contrary to tachyons, which are deﬁned and studied within the orig-
inal framework of standard relativity [11] considered an absolute property of space-time,
the superluminal particles we propose imply by themselves the abandon of this princi-
ple (although the space-time felt by our laboratory remains the ”ordinary” minkowskian
space-time). The new particles have speciﬁc experimental signatures, diﬀerent from those
of tachyons [12]. However, since they can travel much faster than light, they can indeed
produce some ”space-like” phenomena, in astrophysics as well as at accelerators:

- A superluminal particle moving at speed ~v with respect to the vacuum rest frame, and
emitted by an astrophysical object, can reach an observer, moving with laboratory speed
~V with respect to the same frame, at a time (as measured by the observer) previous to the
emission time. Such a phenomenon will happen if ~v. ~V > c2 , and the emitted particle
will be seen to evolve backward in time (but it evolves forward in time in the vacuum rest
frame). If they interact several times with the detector, superluminal particles can be a
directional probe preceding the detailed observation of astrophysical phenomena, such as
explosions releasing simultaneously neutrinos, photons and superluminal particles. Direc-
tional detection of high-speed superluminal particles in a large underground or underwater
detector would allow to trigger a dedicated astrophysical observation in the direction of the
sky determined by the velocity of the superluminal particle(s). If d is the distance between
the observer and the astrophysical object, and ∆t the time delay between the detection of
the superluminal particle(s) and that of photons and neutrinos, we have: d ≃ c∆t .

- Although we expect coupling constants to be small, superluminal particles evolv-
ing backward in time can be produced at high-energy accelerators if the energy range
E >∼ mi c2
i is reached for some of such particles. Large detectors with high time resolu-
tion may in some cases be able to use timing to identify the production of superluminal
particles, especially if they are produced by pairs. If, as suggested by standard cosmology
considerations, a typical speed for superluminal particles in our laboratory rest frame is
v ≈ 103 c ≈ 1011 ms−1 , a detector of radius ≈ 10 m with time resolution ≈ 10−9s (not
incompatible with the LHC program) would in principle be able to distinguish between
ordinary and superluminal particles, at least in some of the relevant events. Larger and
faster detectors would be necessary at a later stage in order to measure a high superlumi-

15

nal speed or to identify a particle evolving backward in time, assuming that it interacts
suﬃciently with the detector (e.g. through ”Cherenkov” eﬀect in vacuum).

A neat experimental distinction can be set between the new superluminal particles and
the ”bradyons” and ”tachyons” of ref. [12] . Even if some experimental predictions show
analogies between our particles and the tachyons, the main properties of the new particles
are closer to those of bradyons (the ordinary subluminal particles of standard particle
physics). The new superluminal particles are actually ”superbradyons”, i.e. bradyons
with a critical speed in vacuum higher than c . Like bradyons, they have positive mass as
well as positive energy in the laboratory rest frame. Contrary to tachyons [13] , they can
emit ”Cherenkov” radiation in vacuum [1 - 5] and, although tachyon theory also hints to
a vacuum rest frame [14], the physical reason is fundamentally diﬀerent: there is no need
for any ”reinterpretation principle” in the case of our superluminal particles.

The analogy with sine-Gordon solitons (see [1 - 5]) can help to understand the diﬀerence
between our ”superbradyons” and the ”tachyons” of previous theories. In a galilean space-
time, we can build dynamical systems satisfying equations of dalembertian type (i.e. with
an invariance identical to Lorentz invariance, but with a diﬀerent critical speed related to
the properties of the dynamical system). Solitons of such systems, if they form a closed
self-interacting system, would feel a ”relativistic” space-time with their own critical speed
playing the role of the speed of light. Such a ”micro-universe” would, in some sense,
fake our Universe in a ﬁnite region of our time. Since the dynamical system has a rest
frame, a ”vacuum rest frame” is automatically set (like in our Universe, if particles are
solitons or topological singularities of vacuum, and if vacuum has a natural rest frame set
by cosmology) ”Lorentz” contraction in the ”micro-universe” is not relative, but absolute,
even if a serious but isolated observer made of solitons would be led to formulate a relativity
principle and believe erroneously that such a contraction is indeed relative. However, the
dalembertian equation is in general a continuum approximation to a discrete system, or
the ”large distance” limit of a more complex dynamics.
It is not valid below a certain
distance scale κ−1 , where κ is a critical wave vector scale of the system.

The above ”micro-universe” is not tachyonic, but bradyonic: solitons have always posi-
tive mass and energy. As long as, even with ”Lorentz” contraction, the longitudinal size of
the soliton remains much larger than κ−1 , ”Lorentz” invariance guarantees that a soliton,
if stable when at rest in the absolute rest frame (the rest frame of the dynamical system),
remains stable when it is accelerated to a nonzero speed with respect to the same frame.
However, if the soliton is accelerated, with respect to the absolute rest frame, to a speed
such that by Lorentz contraction its longitudinal size becomes <∼ κ−1 , the ”relativity
principle” felt by the soliton micro-universe does no longer apply. Then, the previously
stable soliton can decay into other excitations, like unstable waves, and disperse its energy.
A similar discussion can be raised for elementary particles such as quarks and leptons, or
their constituents: can we break these particles, just by accelerating them to an inverse
distance scale such that relativistic kinematics does no longer hold and the structure of
vacuum manifests itself at a deeper level? The existence of very high-energy cosmic rays
seems to indicate that such a phenomenon can only happen at energies beyond the reach
of present and planned accelerators. However, the subject deserves attention from a long-

16

term point of view, not only for future very high-energy machines but also in the analysis
of the highest-energy cosmic rays. In a sectorial grand-uniﬁed theory with spontaneous
symmetry breaking, it may happen that the estimated mass of a Higgs or intermediate
boson be higher than ei c−2
, where κi is the value of κ for the sector under
consideration and ei is a critical energy scale. It is possible that such a boson will never
be formed, and similarly for fermions undergoing the same phenomenon.

i ≈ h κi c−1

The question of whether the constant B (related to some static charge condensed in
vacuum) vanishes or not, arises already in the ordinary sector. It could happen that its ex-
istence be hidden by inertial masses (typically, if AD ≫ B2). Therefore, it seems sensible
to attempt experiments with the so-called ”massless” particles (photon and neutrinos) in
order to possibly show the eﬀect. If B = 0 , a sectorial Lorentz invariance is dynamically
generated. A possible evidence for B 6= 0 would be an asymmetry between neutrino
and antineutrino oscillations. The cosmological role of the condensed charge, and of the
”anomalous” neutrino rest energy, would deserve further investigation.

It turns out from (18), (23) and (24) that, for a high-speed superluminal cosmic ray with
critical speed ci ≫ c , the momentum, as measured in the laboratory, does not provide
directional information on the source, but on the vacuum rest frame. Velocity provides
directional information on the source, but can be measured only if the particle interacts
several times with the detector, which is far from guaranteed, or if the superluminal particle
is associated to a collective phenomenon emitting also photons or neutrinos simultaneously.
¿From (18), if in the vacuum rest frame the detected particle has speed v ≃ ci and energy
E ≃ p ci , the momentum ~p′ in the laboratory rest frame will be dominated by the term
− E c−2 ~V ≃ p ci c−2 ~V if ci v ≫ c2 , while the velocity ~v′ is dominated by the term
~v (1 − ~v. ~V c−2)−1 , and the particle will be seen (in the laboratory) to evolve backward
in time if ~v. ~V > c2 . Again, standard cosmology suggests that the main speed range
for cosmic superluminal particles, as measured on earth by a detector made of ordinary
matter, should be v ≈ 103 c . This would by itself be a signature. As more schematically
emphasized in [5] , one has E′ ≫ p′ c , which leads to ”back-to-back” events if the
superluminal particle transfers most of its energy to a pair of ordinary particles.

In this paper, we have assumed that there exists an absolute rest frame of vacuum,
which: a) is the same for all superluminal sectors ; b) provides the local rest frame for the
expanding Universe; c) is close to the local rest frame suggested by the study of cosmic
background radiation. If superluminal particles are found, it will be possible to directly
check the basic hypothesis of this simple scenario. It may happen that the expansion of
vacuum has followed diﬀerent evolutions for the degrees of freedom linked to diﬀerent sec-
tors or, for instance, that the Universe is not really isotropic because of relative rotational
modes between these sets of degrees of freedom (this anisotropy could even be sponta-
neously generated). In such case, it is likely that a single (local) vacuum rest frame would
not exist. The experimental discovery of particles belonging to diﬀerent superluminal sec-
tors would then (assuming the speed in the laboratory rest frame to be measurable) allow
to extract spectra of ~v and ~p (see Subsection 4b), perhaps not necessarily in the range
v ≈ 103 c or with a diﬀerent directional dependence, for each dynamical sector. It would

17

then, in any case, be possible for the ﬁrst time to get a direct insight into the inner structure
of vacuum (evidence for a non-empty vacuum has been provided by particle physics, e.g.
through the discovery of the W ± and Z 0). Ultimately, experiments at very high-energy
accelerators or an observatory of superluminal cosmic rays may be able to determine the
value of κi for each superluminal sector by looking at the energy, momentum and velocity
distribution of the events. However, although the basic phenomenon can perhaps be neatly
observed, the dynamical interpretation of the data is likely to be far from trivial.

Abstract

A body of theory is completely diﬀerent between relativity theory

and quantum mechanics. Most targeting physical phenomena are dif-

1

ferent between them as well. Despite that both theories describe our

time-space world, no one has succeeded in arriving at one of these

theories by using the other one, deductively. Fusion of these two the-

ories produced quantum ﬁeld theory. However this theory impresses

us as a theory that was made by merging the two theories by force.

So this theory cannot indicate the reason why both relativity the-

ory and quantum mechanics exist in this world at the same time.

Here I show you that quantum mechanics can be led by the equation

of Minkowski’s metrics, which stands up in the relativistic world of

space and time. This is the ﬁrst report proving mathematically that

quantum mechanics can be born reductively in our relativistic world.

space world

The strong success of quantum mechanics is not surprising considering its

much greater degree of eﬃcacy, on an atomic scale, compared to any other

theory. However, it has also been diﬃcult to understand the fundamental

2

implication of quantum mechanics because of its speciﬁcity from the struc-

ture of the theory including wave-particle duality[1]. We are able to see

such speciﬁcity from the aspect that the theory has borne lots of paradoxical

questions. On the other hand, the theory includes another important as-

pect: that it seems to be incompatible with aspects of relativity theory that

exert great validity against our macroscopic scale. Here I would like to pro-

pose some novel techniques and ideas in order to understand the relationship

between these two theories and to solve the paradoxical questions of quan-

tum mechanics, such as wave-particle duality or the measurement problem.

Here it is shown that quantum mechanics can be led from the equation in

Minkowski’s space-time world.

The diﬀerential distance ds in Minkowski’s space-time world (Minkowski’s

metrics) is given by

(ds)2 = −(c dt)2 + (dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2

(1)

For our simpliﬁed spacetime, with just one space dimension, this reduces to

(ds)2 = −(c dt)2 + (dx)2

(2)

3

This can also be rewritten by

(ds)2 = −(c dt)2(cos2 θt − (i sin θt)2) + (dx)2(cos2 θx − (i sin θx)2)

= −(c dt cos θt, ic dt sin θt)(c dt cos θt, −ic dt sin θt)

+ (dx cos θx, i dx sin θx)(dx cos θx, −i dx sin θx)

= −dψt · dψ∗

i = √

−1

dψ(θ) = dx(cos θ, i sin θ)

dψ∗(θ) = dx(cos θ, −i sin θ) = dψ(−θ)

These dψ and dψ∗ are expressed as the coordinates on a circumference in

a complex space of real and imaginary axis (Figure 1). I will discuss later

concerning this complex space. First of all, you consider a complex world

consisting with an imaginary space lying at right angles to a real space for

either its time dimension or its space dimension. Then you think about

a circle consisting of a minute segment (dx) as a radius (Figure 1). The

“dψ(θ) = dx(cos θ, i sin θ) ” or the “dψ∗(θ) = dx(cos θ, −i sin θ) ” shown
above represents points on the circumference. If this condition ψ is involved

in a quantum behavior, θ must be a function of the coordinates of the real

space, x. When you consider the existence of a particle in this minute region

4

∆x, the condition must have a feature of a wave in the imaginary space.

If you use λ for its wavelength, you can substitute

2π
λ

x for θ. So if you

write the particle’s condition as the function of x like ψ(x), the condition

in the minute region dψ(x) is written as dψ(x) = dx(i sin

2π
λ

This can be rewritten as

= (i sin

this, you get the equation shown below.

Next, you think about time dimension as well. You combine the equation

dψ(t) = dt(i sin θ, cos θ) and θ = −2πνt.
Then you get

tions of the equation is ψ(t) = i

= c(i sin(−2πνt), cos(−2πνt)). One of the simplest solu-

By substituting ν =

into this equation, you get

Equivalent results can be obtained concerning ψ ∗(x) and ψ ∗(t) as well. So,

5

all the results can be put together with the simple equations shown below.

Here I succeeded in demonstrating that quantum mechanics can be led by

Minkowski’s space-time world by assuming the existence of an imaginary

space lying at right angles to a real space for either its time dimension or

its space dimension. You can also see from the equation of ψ or ψ ∗ that

the quantum mechanical area size of a particle is restricted in

¯h
P

, in which

the particle exists as two waves written by complex numbers (ψ and ψ ∗).

This means that any matter produces a quantum ﬁeld by its momentum,

and that the size of the ﬁeld is restricted by the momentum. In addition,

both of the quantum mechanical functions led by two wave functions ψ and

ψ ∗ are equivalent, so these quantum mechanical features are undeniably with

each other. The conclusion is that any particle moves as two quantum me-

chanical waves of ψ and ψ ∗ in its speciﬁc small areas. On the other hand, if

you write the condition of a particle without the idea of an imaginary space,

6

you cannot see such quantum mechanical features. Here you get a solution

against the measurement problem of quantum theories. The measurement

itself is equivalent to denying the existence of an imaginary space because we

cannot measure any movement in imaginary spaces. So if you describe the

movement according to the measurement, you never reach the functions of

ψ and ψ ∗. So you can only measure the space by (dx)2 = gij dxi dxj, which

is an incomplete equation of the equation (6).

Next, I discuss the meaning of the complex world of real and imaginary axes.

The imaginary axis lying at right angles to a real axis (Figure 1) can be

interpreted as an axis of the ﬁfth dimension, which is diﬀerent from our four-

dimensional world. However, more simple and easy alternative idea may be

to interpret it as a time axis. On the contrary, an imaginary axis against time

axis can be interpreted as an axis of the ﬁfth or sixth dimensions. However,

the more simple and easy way is to interpret it as a space axis. For instance,

you put a space axis and an imaginary axis lying at right angles to the space

axis as x and iy, respectively (i = √

−1), metric tensor (ds)2 is given by

(ds)2 = (dx)2 + (idy)2 = (dx)2

− (dy)2

(8)

This indicates that the iy axis is in a time dimension.

In addition, the

7

equation (3) indicates that both the space and time axes can be treated

as the complex of real and imaginary axes in a minute region. And this

operation can lead quantum mechanics as I showed. These facts lead us to

imagine that the essence of quantum mechanics lies in the transformation

between space and time regions in the world of space and time.

Figure 1: Particles exist in complex world

I hypothesize that an imaginary world exists against our real world of time

and space. The equation (3) indicates that the axes of the imaginary world

lie at right angles to the axes of the real world. You consider a particle, which

is moving with momentum P at a moment. This particle is supposed to have

an uncertain region (∆x). And this uncertain region can be composed of two

diﬀerent conditions (∆ψ and ∆ψ ∗) according to the equation (3).

Abstract

New method for dissociation of diatomic molecule based on nonperiodic exci-
tation generated by energy-feedback control mechanism is proposed. The energy-
feedback control uses frequency-energy (FE) relation of the natural oscillations to
fulﬁll the resonance conditions at any time of excitation. Eﬃciency of the proposed
method is demonstrated by the problem of dissociation of hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF)
molecule.
It is shown that new method is more eﬃcient then methods based on
constant frequency and linear chirping excitation.

Keywords: diatomic molecule, dissociation, control, feedback.

1 Introduction

During last decade a growing interest has been observed in the control problems for
molecular systems in classical and quantum formulation [1, 2, 3]. One of the simplest

problems of that type is dissociation problem for diatomic molecule [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. It
often serves as a benchmark for comparison of classical and quantum calculations. In the
paper [4] possibilities of dissociation a molecule by monochromatic (single frequency) laser

ﬁeld have been explored for the case of hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) molecule using Chirikov’s
resonance overlap criterion. In [5, 6] the case of two-frequency (two-laser) control ﬁeld was

investigated. It was shown that intensity of two-frequency ﬁeld required for dissociation
can be reduced compared to one-frequency case. In [8] the further reduction of the control

ﬁeld intensity has been demonstrated by means of chirping (frequency modulation) the
laser frequency with constant chirping rate.

New possibilities for changing of physical and chemical properties are provided by
using feedback. In [3] methods based on geometric control theory (inverse control) were
proposed for molecular systems. In the papers [9, 10] a general method for investigation

of physical systems by means of feedback controlling actions was proposed. It was shown
in [9] by example of the problem of escape from a potential well that feedback allows to

reduce control intensity required for overcoming a potential barrier by several orders of
magnitude. It appears that using speed-gradient method [11, 12] for design of feedback

control action allows to achieve desired level of energy by excitation of intensity inversely
proportional to the system dissipation degree. Particularly, for conservative systems it

allows to reach any energy level by (ideally) arbitrarily small control action.

In this paper the algorithm of the feedback frequency chirping of the controlling ﬁeld
frequency is proposed based on dependence of the natural frequency of the nonlinear

molecule oscillations on its energy, further referred to as frequency-energy characteristics
or frequency-energy curve (FE-curve). On-line implementation of the algorithm requires

measurement of molecule energy only. This can be easily generalized for an ensemble of
molecules, replacing exact energy of the separate molecule in the control criterion by the

average energy per single molecule. However, for control algorithm design the knowledge
of the frequency-energy relation is required. In this paper a classical Morse potential is

considered, which allows obtaining this relation in a simple analytical form. For other
potentials, where the analytical solution is too complicated or impossible, the frequency-
energy relation can be obtained numerically. Eﬃciency of the proposed algorithm for the

case of HF molecule is illustrated by computer simulation. It is shown that the time of
dissociation can be reduced signiﬁcantly when using proper feedback excitation.

2 Basic equations

Let us consider a diatomic molecular system under the action of the external laser ﬁeld.
Dynamics of such a system can be described by the following controlled Hamiltonian [6, 3]

H =

µ(r) u(t) ,

−

where m is reduced mass, p is momentum, Π(r) is potential of interatomic interaction,

µ(r) is dipole moment of the molecule, u(t) is intensity of external ﬁeld. The value u(t)
serves as control variable. E.g. for monochromatic control ﬁeld u(t) = E cos(ωt), where

E and ω are strength and frequency of the external laser ﬁeld. Substitution of (1) into
Hamilton equations

3 Control of the dissociation process

In a nonlinear system the resonance frequency is function of the amplitude of oscillations,

or, in other words, it depends on the energy of the oscillator. Thus the faster dissociation
can be achieved if the excitation frequency is changing (decreasing in our case) while

the energy increases. The simplest control algorithm of this kind can be done by linear
chirping:

ω = Ω0 −

where ε is a constant (chirping rate), which characterizes the speed of the frequency
decrease. In this case equation of motion (4) takes the form

m¨r =

Π′(r) + Eµ′(r) cos ϕ ,

−

˙ϕ = ω(t) = Ω0 −

εt .

(13)

(Note that in this case the representation ϕ = ωt is not valid since the frequency ω is not

constant.

More eﬀective dissociation can be achieved by taking advantage of the feedback control.

In this case the frequency of excitation can be changed according to the oscillator energy
so that at any amplitude of oscillations the excitation will act at the resonance frequency.

Let Ω(W ) be the natural frequency of the diatomic molecular oscillator at the speciﬁed
energy W . We call the function Ω(W ) frequency-energy curve of FE-curve. It contains
important information about dynamics of the molecular motion. The key idea of our

approach is that if the curve Ω(W ) is known and the energy W = W (t) is observable then
control algorithm

m¨r =

Π′(r) + Eµ′(r) cos ϕ ,

˙ϕ = Ω(W )

will give the desired excitation at the resonance frequency at any time instant.

The relation Ω(W ) in principle can be calculated for any known potential Π(r) using

the integral of energy, which is realized when the external force is absent

where W is a constant value of energy, T is period of the oscillations, r1 and r2 are the
minimum and the maximum possible values of radius r for the speciﬁed potential energy

(the solutions of the equation Π(r) = W ).
If period T is known then frequency can
be obtained as Ω = 2π/T . Obviously integral (15) can not be calculated analytically

for arbitrary potential and the desired relation Ω(W ) should be evaluated by numeric
integration.

Luckily for the Morse potential (5) the integral can be evaluated analytically in the
following way. Substitution ζ = ζ(r) = eα(r−a) transforms the integral (15) in the case of
Morse potential to the simple form which can be easily integrated

The above formula is valid if W < 0. Otherwise, the motion of the system is not peri-

odic, since the molecule dissociates. Equation (16) provides the following simple relation

4 Calculations

Eﬃciency of the proposed control algorithm was conﬁrmed by computer simulations for
dissociation of the hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) molecule that has become a benchmark problem

for controlled dissociation [3, 6, 13]. The parameters of the model 8, corresponding to HF
molecule [3, 6, 13] are as follows: m = 1732, D = 0.2101, α = 1.22, a = 1.75, A = 0.4541,

ξ = 0.0064, E = 0.1. All quantities are given in atomic units. The initial condition for
˙r = 0.
excitation is molecule equilibrium at the bottom of the potential well: r = a,

The equation was integrated numerically by central diﬀerences method with time step
dt = T0/160 (integration with smaller time steps yields practically the same results.

frequency ω = 0.841Ω0. Energy is measured in the units of the bond energy D, time is in
the units of T0 (natural period of linear oscillations).

The result of excitation at the resonance frequency is shown in Fig. 1a. The graph
shows that the motion is quasiperiodic and maximum value of energy, which can be

0.68D. Since the natural frequency of the molecule is
achieved by this method, is
decreasing when the energy is growing, more eﬃcient excitation can be achieved at lower

−

frequencies. It is even possible to dissociate the molecule if the excitation frequency is close
13.5T0 the energy crosses the zero
to 0.841Ω0 — see Fig. 2a. The ﬁgure shows that at t
level, and at t = 14.5T0 the energy becomes a positive constant. This practically means

≈

that the potential energy is negligible and atoms are moving in the opposite directions
with constant velocities (total dissociation). However this result is not structurally stable:

small variation in the excitation frequency can noticeably increase the dissociation time
and even break the dissociation.

in units of D and T0.

Fig. 2a,b correspond to linear frequency chirping (12) at two diﬀerent chirping rates.

The dissociation is also achieved, but it is slower then in the previous case and the results
are very sensitive to the variations of ε. Additional ﬂexibility to the chirping process can
εt, where ω0 is a constant less then Ω0. Optimal
added by using the relation ω = ω0 −
selection of both parameters is a pretty complicated task. In more detail this problem is
investigated in [8].

In this paper we will concentrate on the feedback chirping, based on the frequency-
energy curve (17). Fig. 3a shows the energy as a function of time for the feedback con-

−

trol (18). At the initial stage the energy is growing faster then in other cases, but after
0.5D is reached, the eﬃciency of the excitation decreases so that
the level about W =

dissociation is not realized. Probably this phenomenon is caused by wrong phasing which
prevents the molecule dissociation although the resonance condition is all the time fulﬁlled.
Indeed, the sign of the multiplier µ′(r) in equation (4) due to formula (7) is changing for
high energies, so that the excitation starts acting in the opposite phase. To overcome this
diﬃculty the following algorithm can be used: when the energy of the molecule reaches

some certain value W∗ then the sign of the excitation force is permanently changing to
the opposite. The result of such an excitation is shown in Fig. 3b. The dissociation is
achieved at t = 10T0, which is faster then in all previous cases.

this level is suﬃciently small then excitation at any constant frequency can not provide
the dissociation. On the contrary, excitation with changing frequency can in principle

give dissociation for any arbitrarily small level of control. For illustration let us consider
the 5 times smaller control then in previous calculations: E = 0.02 a.u.
In this case

dissociation at a constant frequency is not possible. Results of linear chirping and feedback
control excitation are given in Fig. 4. For simplicity these calculations use approximation
µ′(r)
µ′(a). The plots show that both methods provide dissociation. However, linear
chirping achieves dissociation at t = 89T0, while energy-feedback control achieves it at
t = 34T0. Thus the feedback control provides more then two times faster dissociation
then the best variant of the linear chirping.

≈

Although the proposed algorithm requires measurement of molecule energy only, its

on-line implementation requires changing controlling action at the time intervals less then
10−12 s. This can be achieved with modern ultrafast lasers. The approach can be easily
generalized to control of an ensemble of molecules, replacing exact energy of the separate
molecule in the control objective by the average energy per single molecule.

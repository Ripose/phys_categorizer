Dynamics of a particle entrained in the medium ﬂow

The centripetal and Coriolis accelerations experienced by a cart travelling over a rotating turntable
can be viewed as due to the entrainment force exerted upon the body by the moving solid environs.
We generalize the problem to the overall case of a particle entrained in a velocity ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

When considering a man walking in an accelerated train or a car travelling over the Earth’s surface we introduce
inertial forces. These ﬁctitious forces can be calculated from kinematics of the system. Then, returning to the inertial
reference frame, we may obtain real forces that the train and the Earth exert upon the bodies. In this context the
moving plane and the rotating surface are actually solid medium ﬂows that entrain the man and the car respectively.
It is interesting to extend the approach to the general case of a particle carried by a medium ﬂow. In this event
we will not look into a physical origin of the entrainment but simply postulate that the particle at rest acquires the
velocity of the entraining medium, i.e. it is advected as a tracer. We will assume also that it retains its own motion.
The problem can be stated as follows. Given a velocity ﬁeld u(r, t). There is a particle at ξ that is entrained in
this ﬁeld. The entrainment means that at any instant of time the full velocity v of the particle can be represented as
the sum of the particle’s relative velocity υ and the medium’s velocity

where the dependence ˇυ(t) of the relative velocity in the reference frame ˇr accompanying the velocity ﬁeld at ξ is
known. The relative motion of the particle will be assumed to be uniform and rectilinear, i.e.

We want to ﬁnd the particle’s acceleration due to (1)-(3), or equivalently the force f needed in order to ensure (1)-(3).

Formally f can be found using (1) in the equation

where m is the mass of the particle. The diﬃculty in the direct diﬀerentiating of (1) is that we do not know the
dependence υ(t) on time in the inertial reference frame underlying the medium. Still we know ˇυ(t) as given by (3).
Below the particular case of the kinematics will be ﬁrstly considered that is known as the centripetal and Coriolis

accelerations. Then the Lagrange technique will be used for a general treatment.

2. THE CORIOLIS FORCE

We will consider a particular yet the important case. A particle moving in two dimensions with relative velocity υ
is entrained in a rotating ﬁeld. We are interested in the evolution of the full velocity v of the particle. Looking at the
problem more generally the evolution of any vector entrained in a rotating ﬁeld can be primarily discussed1.

Let some vector G be rotated about an axis through an angle ϕ. As can be seen from geometrical considerations
the angle between the vectors in initial and ﬁnal positions will be ϕ as well. The increment of G due to rotation
through a small angle dϕ is given by

where ω is the angle velocity. Substituting r for G in (5) we obtain the very rotating ﬁeld

(dG)rot = dϕ × G = dtω × G.

frame ˇr, (5) can be generalized to

v = υ + ω × ξ.

Putting (6) in (1) we obtain the velocity of a particle entrained in the rotating ﬁeld:

Diﬀerentiating (8) with respect to time we get

The normal inertial force 2mυ × ω found from (11) is referred to as the Coriolis force.

3. DYNAMICS OF A PARTICLE ENTRAINED IN A VELOCITY FIELD

We will consider the general case of the dynamics of the entrained particle and then verify it by the rotating ﬁeld.
Converting the right-hand part of (1) into the reference frame accompanying the velocity ﬁeld at ξ we get for the

kinetic energy of the particle

By the construction ˇu( ˇξ) ≡ 0. However we retain it in (12) since may be ˇu(ˇr) 6= 0 for ˇr 6= ˇξ. Lagrange equations for
the evolution of the particle’s relative velocity are

where the well-known vector relation ∇ (a · b) = (a · ∇) b + (b · ∇) a + a × (∇ × b) + b × (∇ × a) was used. Using

In order to interpret terms in the right-hand part of (18) we will apply (18) to the particular case, the rotating ﬁeld.
We have for (6) in two dimensions

curlu = 2ω,

∇u2 = ω2ξ.

Substituting (19)-(20) into (18) we come to the relation (11) previously obtained from kinematical considerations.

Equation (21) can be viewed as describing dynamics of a particle entrained in the stream of a ﬂuid. By (21) particles
will drift to the region where the velocity is low. This theoretical prediction is in accord with observations that the
litter ﬂoating in the river is carried away to the bank. The ﬂow of an ideal ﬂuid is governed by the Euler equation
that can be written down in the Gromeka-Lamb form

where ̺ is the density of the ﬂuid. Multiplying (22) by m and using it in (21) gives with the account of (1)

It is interesting that (23) has the same structure as the equation of the positron moving in the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

5. THE PARTICLE IN THE AVERAGED TURBULENCE

Following Osborne Reynolds the velocity of the turbulent ﬂuid can be decomposed into the sum of the average hui

and ﬂuctuation u′ components

where hu′i = 0. Substituting (24) into (21) and averaging we get

The second term in the right-hand part of (25) includes the density of the turbulence energy

When hui = const we have from (25) and (26)

where V = m/̺ is the eﬀective volume of the particle. Equation (27) describes the particle’s drift toward regions
of decreasing turbulence intensity. This eﬀect is known as turbophoresis2,3,4. By (27) in the stationary non-uniform
turbulence the entrained particle is undergone to the potential force. Substituting (24) into (22), averaging, taking
for simplicity the irrotational ﬂuctuation ﬁeld and integrating in the absence of the average ﬂow we obtain with the
account of (26) the turbulence Bernoulli integral

u = hui + u′

By (28) stationary turbulence inhomogeneities ε(r) may arise near solid walls and cavities that provide appropriate
boundary conditions and thus can be considered as sources of the turbulence force potential ﬁeld. We may expect
near walls the pressure elevated in comparison with the inner region of the ﬂuid. Thus, by (27) and (28) particles
will segregate and accumulate in the boundary layer5,6,7. Remarkably that the system of a particle entrained in the
stationary turbulence imitates electrostatics. The eﬀective volume V plays in (27) the role of the particle’s ”charge”.

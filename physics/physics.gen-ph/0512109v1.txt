3-Space In-Flow Theory of Gravity: Boreholes, Blackholes
and the Fine Structure Constant

A theory of 3-space explains the phenomenon of gravity as arising from the
time-dependence and inhomogeneity of the diﬀerential ﬂow of this 3-space.
The emergent theory of gravity has two gravitational constants: GN - New-
ton’s constant, and a dimensionless constant α. Various experiments and
astronomical observations have shown that α is the ﬁne structure constant
≈ 1/137. Here we analyse the Greenland Ice Shelf and Nevada Test Site bore-
hole g anomalies, and conﬁrm with increased precision this value of α. This
and other successful tests of this theory of gravity, including the supermassive
black holes in globular clusters and galaxies, and the ‘dark-matter’ eﬀect in
spiral galaxies, demonstrates the validity of this theory of gravity. This success
implies that Newtonian gravity was fundamentally ﬂawed from the beginning.

Introduction

In the Newtonian theory of gravity [1] the Newtonian gravitational constant GN determining the
strength of this phenomenon is diﬃcult to measure because of the extreme weakness of gravity.
Originally determined in laboratory experiments by Cavendish [2] in 1798 using a torsion balance,
Airy [3] in 1865 presented a diﬀerent method which compared the gravity gradients above and below
the surface of the earth. Then if the matter density within the neighbourhood of the measurements
is suﬃciently uniform, or at most is horizontally layered and known, then such measurements then
permitted GN to be determined, as discussed below, if Newtonian gravity was indeed correct. Then
the mass of the earth can be computed from the value of g at the earth’s surface. However two
anomalies have emerged for these two methods: (i) the Airy method has given gravity gradients that
are inconsistent with Newtonian gravity, and (ii) the laboratory measurements of GN using various
geometries for the test masses have not converged despite ever increasing experimental sophistication
and precision. There are other anomalies involving gravity such as the so-called ‘dark-matter’ eﬀect
in spiral galaxies, the systematic eﬀects related to the supermassive blackholes in globular clusters
and elliptical galaxies, the Pioneer 10/11 deceleration anomaly, the so-called galactic ‘dark-matter’
networks, and others, all suggest that the phenomenon of gravity has not been understood even in the
non-relativistic regime, and that a signiﬁcant dynamical process has been overlooked in the Newtonian
theory of gravity, and which is also missing from General Relativity.

The discovery of this missing dynamical process arose from experimental evidence [4, 8, 9] that
a complex dynamical 3-space underlies reality. The evidence involves the repeated detection of the
motion of the earth relative to that 3-space using Michelson interferometers operating in gas mode [8],
particularly the experiment by Miller in 1925/26 at Mt.Wilson, and the coaxial cable RF travel time
measurements by Torr and Kolen in Utah in 1985, and the DeWitte experiment in 1991 in Brussels
[8]. In all 7 such experiments are consistent with respect to speed and direction. It has been shown
that eﬀects caused by motion relative to this 3-space can mimic the formalism of spacetime, but that
it is the 3-space that is ‘real’, simply because it is directly observable [4].

The 3-space is in diﬀerential motion, that is one part has a velocity relative to other parts, and
so involves a velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) description. To be speciﬁc this velocity ﬁeld must be described
relative to a frame of observers, but the formalism is such that the dynamical equations for this
velocity ﬁeld must transform covariantly under a change of observer. It has been shown [4, 6] that the
phenomenon of gravity is a consequence of the time-dependence and inhomogeneities of v(r, t). So the

1

dynamical equations for v(r, t) give rise to a new theory of gravity when combined with the generalised
Schr¨odinger equation, and the generalised Maxwell and Dirac equations [10]. The equations for v(r, t)
involve the gravitational constant1 G and a dimensionless constant that determines the strength of
a new 3-space self-interaction eﬀect, which is missing from both Newtonian Gravity and General
Relativity. Experimental data has revealed [4, 5, 6] the remarkable discovery that this constant is
the ﬁne structure constant α ≈ e2/¯hc ≈ 1/137. This dynamics then explains numerous gravitational
anomalies, such as the borehole g anomaly, the so-called ‘dark matter’ anomaly in the rotation speeds
of spiral galaxies, and that the eﬀective mass of the necessary black holes at the centre of spherical
matter systems, such as globular clusters and spherical galaxies, is α/2 times the total mass of these
systems. This prediction has been conﬁrmed by astronomical observations [7].

Here we analyse the Greenland and Nevada Test Site borehole g anomalies, and conﬁrm with

increased precision this value of α.

The occurrence of α suggests that space is itself a quantum system undergoing on-going classi-
calisation. Just such a proposal has arisen in Process Physics [4] which is an information-theoretic
modelling of reality. There quantum space and matter arise in terms of the Quantum Homotopic Field
Theory (QHFT) which, in turn, may be related to the standard model of matter. In the QHFT space
at this quantum level is best described as a ‘quantum foam’. So we interpret the observed fractal2
3-space as a classical approximation to this ‘quantum foam’ [10].

2 Dynamical 3-Space

Relative to some observer 3-space is described by a velocity ﬁeld v(r, t). It is important to note that
the coordinate r is not itself 3-space, rather it is merely a label for an element of 3-space that has
velocity v, relative to some observer. Also it is important to appreciate that this ‘moving’ 3-space
is not itself embedded in a ‘space’; the 3-space is all there is, although as noted above its deeper
structure is that of a ‘quantum foam’.

In the case of zero vorticity ∇×v = 0 the 3-space dynamics is given by [4, 6], in the non-relativistic

limit,

It was shown in [10] that matter has the same acceleration3 as (3), which gave a derivation of the
equivalence principle as a quantum eﬀect in the Schr¨odinger equation when uniquely generalised to
include the interaction of the quantum system with the 3-space. These forms are mandated by Galilean
covariance under change of observer4. This minimalist non-relativistic modelling of the dynamics for
the velocity ﬁeld gives a direct account of the various phenomena noted above. A generalisation to
include vorticity and relativistic eﬀects of the motion of matter through this 3-space is given in [4].
From (1) and (3) we obtain that

∇.g = −4πGρ − 4πGρDM ,

1This is diﬀerent from the Newtonian eﬀective gravitational constant GN deﬁned later.
2The fractal property of 3-space was established from the DeWitte data in [10].

time dilations of moving clocks.

Figure 1: Upper plot shows speeds from numerical iterative solution of (7) for a solid sphere with uniform
density and radius r = 1 for (i) upper curve the case α = 0 corresponding to Newtonian gravity, and (ii)
lower curve with α = 1/137. These solutions ony diﬀer signiﬁcantly near r = 0. Middle plot shows matter
density and ‘dark matter’ density ρDM , from (5), with arbitrary scales. Lower plot shows the acceleration
from (3) for (i) the Newtonian in-ﬂow from the upper plot, and (ii) from the α = 1/137 case. The diﬀerence
is only signiﬁcant near r = 0. The accelerations begin to diﬀer just inside the surface of the sphere at r = 1,
according to (15). This diﬀerence is the origin of the borehole g anomaly, and permits the determination of
the value of α from observational data. This generic singular-g behaviour, at r = 0, is seen in the earth, in
globular clusters and in galaxies.

Figure 2: The data shows Log10[MBH /M ] for the ‘blackhole’ or ‘dark matter’ masses MBH for a variety of
spherical matter systems with masses M , shown by solid circles, plotted against Log10[M/M0], where M0 is
the solar mass, showing agreement with the ‘α/2-line’ (Log10[α/2] = −2.44) predicted by (10), and ranging
over 15 orders of magnitude. The ‘blackhole’ eﬀect is the same phenomenon as the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect. The
data ranges from the earth, as observed by the bore hole g anomaly, to globular cluster M15 and G1, and then
to spherical ‘elliptical’ galaxies M32 (E2), NGC 4374 (E1) and M87 (E0). Best ﬁt to the data from these star
systems gives α = 1/134, while for the earth data in Figs.3, 4, 5 give α = 1/137. In these systems the ‘dark
matter’ or ‘black hole’ spatial self-interaction eﬀect is induced by the matter. For the spiral galaxies, shown
by the ﬁlled boxes, where here M is the bulge mass, the blackhole masses do not correlate with the ‘α/2-
line’. This is because these systems form by matter in-falling to a primordial blackhole, and so these systems
are more contingent. For spiral galaxies this dynamical eﬀect manifests most clearly via the non-Keplerian
rotation-velocity curve, which decrease asymptotically very slowly. See [7] for references to the data.

32πG

In this form we see that if α → 0, then the acceleration of the 3-space elements is given by Newton’s
Universal Law of Gravitation, in diﬀerential form. But for a non-zero α we see that the 3-space
acceleration has an additional eﬀect, from the ρDM term, which is an eﬀective ‘matter density’ that
mimics the new self-interaction dynamics. This has been shown to be the origin of the so-called ‘dark
matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies. It is important to note that (4) does not determine g directly; rather
the velocity dynamics in (1) must be solved, and then with g subsequently determined from (3).
Eqn.(4) merely indicates that the resultant non-Newtonian g could be mistaken as the result of a new
form of matter, whose density is given by ρDM . Of course the saga of ‘dark matter’ shows that this
actually happened, and that there has been a misguided and fruitless search for such ‘matter’.

3 Airy Method for Determining α

We now show that the Airy method actually gives a technique for determining the value of α from
earth based borehole gravity measurements. For a time-independent velocity ﬁeld (1) may be written

the matter density proﬁle. This turns out to be a very useful property as complete knowledge of
the density proﬁle is then not required in order to analyse observational data. As seen in Fig.1 the
singular behaviour of both v and g means that there is a blackhole6 singularity at r = 0. Interpreting
MDM in (10) as the mass of the blackholes observed in the globular clusters M 15 and G1 and in the
highly spherical ‘elliptical’ galaxies M32, M87 and NGC 4374, we obtained [7] α ≈ 1/134, as shown
in Fig.2.

From (3), which is also the acceleration of matter [10], the gravity acceleration7 is found to be, to

This gives Newton’s ‘inverse square law’ for r > R, even when α 6= 0, which explains why the 3-
space self-interaction dynamics did not overtly manifest in the analysis of planetary orbits by Kepler
and then Newton. However inside the earth (11) shows that g(r) diﬀers from the Newtonian theory,
corresponding to α = 0, as in Fig1, and it is this eﬀect that allows the determination of the value of
α from the Airy method.

Expanding (11) in r about the surface, r = R, we obtain, to 1st order in α and for an arbitrary

gravity and the new theory diﬀer only beneath the surface, provided that the measured above surface gravity
gradient is used in both theories. This then gives the horizontal line above the surface. Using (15) we obtain

Assuming Newtonian gravity (14) then means that from the measurement of diﬀerence between the
above-ground and below-ground gravity gradients, namely 4πGN ρ, and also measurement of the
matter density, permit the determination of GN . This is the basis of the Airy method for determining
GN [3].

When analysing the borehole data it has been found [11, 12] that the observed diﬀerence of the
gravity gradients was inconsistent with 4πGN ρ in (14), in that it was not given by the laboratory
value of GN and the measured matter density. This is known as the borehole g anomaly and which
attracted much interest in the 1980’s. The borehole data papers [11, 12] report the discrepancy,
i.e. the anomaly or the gravity residual as it is called, between the Newtonian prediction and the
measured below-earth gravity gradient. Taking the diﬀerence between (12) and (14), assuming the
same unknown value of GN in both, we obtain an expression for the gravity residual

g(r) proﬁle [12], deﬁned as ∆g(r) = gNewton − gobserved, and measured in mGal, plotted against depth in km.
This residual shows regions of linearity interspersed with regions of non-linearity, presumably arising from
layers with a density diﬀerent from the main density of 2000 kg/m3. Density changes generate a change in the

The two ﬁtted regions of data are shown by the two straight lines here and in Fig.5.

When α 6= 0 we have a two-parameter theory of gravity, and from (12) we see that measurement
of the diﬀerence between the above ground and below ground gravity gradients is 4π(1 − α
2 )GN ρ, and
this is not suﬃcient to determine both GN and α, given ρ, and so the Airy method is now understood
not to be a complete measurement by itself, i.e. we need to combine it with other measurements. If we
now use laboratory Cavendish experiments to determine GN , then from the borehole gravity residuals
we can determine the value of α, as already indicated in [5, 6]. As discussed in Sect.7 these Cavendish
experiments can only determine GN up to corrections of order α/4, simply because the analysis of
the data from these experiments assumed the validity of Newtonian gravity. So the analysis of the
borehole residuals will give the value of α up to O(α2) corrections, which is consistent with the O(α)
analysis reported above.

4 Greenland Ice Shelf Borehole Data

Gravity residuals from a bore hole into the Greenland Ice Shelf were determined down to a depth of
1.5 km by Ander et al. [11] in 1989. The observations were made at the Dye 3 2033 m deep borehole,
which reached the basement rock. This borehole is 60 km south of the Arctic Circle and 125 km
inland from the Greenland east coast at an elevation of 2530 m. It was believed that the ice provided
an opportunity to use the Airy method to determine GN , but now it is understood that in fact the
borehole residuals permit the determination of α, given a laboratory value for GN . Various steps
were taken to remove unwanted eﬀects, such as imperfect knowledge of the ice density and, most
dominantly, the terrain eﬀects which arises from ignorance of the proﬁle and density inhomogeneities
of the underlying rock. The borehole gravity meter was calibrated by comparison with an absolute
gravity meter. The ice density depends on pressure, temperature and air content, with the density
rising to its average value of ρ = 920 kg/m3 within some 200 m of the surface, due to compression of

g(r) proﬁle [12], deﬁned as ∆g(r) = gNewton − gobserved, and measured in mGal, plotted against depth in km.
This residual shows regions of linearity interspersed with regions of non-linearity, presumably arising from
layers with a density diﬀerent from the main density of 2000 kg/m3. Density changes generate a change in
the (arbitrary) residual oﬀset. From a least-squares simultaneous ﬁt of the linear form in (15) to the slope of
the four linear regions in this data and that in Fig.4 for the data from borehole U20AK in Fig.4, we obtain

the trapped air bubbles. This surface gradient in the density has been modelled by the author, and is
not large enough the aﬀect the results. The leading source of uncertainty was from the gravitational
eﬀect of the bedrock topography, and this was corrected for using Newtonian gravity. The correction
from this is actually the cause of the non-linearity of the data points in Fig.3. A complete analysis
would require that the eﬀect of this rock terrain be also computed using the new theory of gravity,
but this was not done. Using GN = 6.6742 × 10−11 m3s−2kg−1, which is the current CODATA value,
see sect.7, we obtain from a least-squares ﬁt of the linear term in (15) to the data points in Fig.3 that
α−1 = 137.9 ± 5, which equals the value of the ﬁne structure constant α−1 = 137.036 to within the
errors, and for this reason we identify the constant α in (1) as being the ﬁne structure constant. The
ﬁrst analysis [5, 6] of the Greenland Ice Shelf data incorrectly assumed that the ice density was 930
kg/m3 which gave α−1 = 139 ± 5. However trapped air reduces the standard ice density to the ice
shelf density of 920 kg/m3, which brings the value of α immediately into better agreement with the
value of α = e2/¯hc known from quantum theory.

5 Nevada Test Site Borehole Data

Thomas and Vogel [12] performed another borehole experiment at the Nevada Test Site in 1989 in
which they measured the gravity gradient as a function of depth, the local average matter density,
and the above ground gradient, also known as the free-air gradient. Their intention was to test the
extracted Glocal and compare with other values of GN , but of course using the Newtonian theory.
The Nevada boreholes, with typically 3 m diameter, were drilled as a part of the U.S. Government
tests of its nuclear weapons. The density of the rock is measured with a γ − γ logging tool, which
is essentially a γ-ray attenuation measurement, while in some holes the rock density was measured
with a coreing tool. The rock density was found to be 2000 kg/m3, and is dry. This is the density

in the residual.

used in the analysis herein. The topography for 1 to 2 km beneath the surface is dominated by a
series of overlapping horizontal lava ﬂows and alluvial layers. Gravity residuals from three of the bore
holes are shown in Figs.4, 5 and 6. All gravity measurements were corrected for the earth’s tide, the
terrain on the surface out to 168 km distance, and the evacuation of the holes. The gravity residuals
arise after allowing for, using Newtonian theory, the local lateral mass anomalies but assumed that
the matter beneath the holes occurs in homogeneous ellipsoidal layers. Here we now report a detailed
analysis of the Nevada data. First we note that the gravity residuals from borehole U20AO, Fig.6,
are not suﬃciently linear to be useful. This presumably arises from density variations caused by
the layering eﬀect. For boreholes UA20AK, Fig.4, and UA20AL, Fig.5, we see segments where the
gravity residuals are linear with depth, where the density is the average value of 2000 kg/m3, but
interspersed by layers where the residuals show non-linear changes with depth. It is assumed here
that these non-linear regions are caused by variable density layers. So in analysing this data we have
only used the linear regions, and a simultaneous least-squares ﬁt of the slope of (15) to the slopes of
these four linear regions gives α−1 = 136.8 ± 3, which again is in extraordinary agreement with the
value of 137.04 from quantum theory. Here we again used GN = 6.6742 × 10−11 m3s−2kg−1, as for
the Greenland data analysis,

6 Ocean Measurements

The ideal Airy experiment would be one using the ocean, as all relevant physical aspects are accessible.
Such an experiment was carried out by Zumberge et al. in 1991 [13] using submersibles. Corrections
for sea ﬂoor topography, seismic proﬁles and sea surface undulations were carried out. However a true
Airy experiment appears not to have been performed. That would have required the measurement
of the above and below sea-surface gravity gradients. Rather only the below sea-surface gradients
were measured, and compared with a predicted gravity gradient using the density of the water and
a laboratory value of GN from only one such experiment and, as shown in Fig.7, these have a large

Figure 7: Results of precision measurements of GN published in the last sixty years in which the Newtonian
theory was used to analyse the data. These results show the presence of a systematic eﬀect, not in the

GN (outer dashed lines), with the full line being the current CODATA value of GN = (6.6742(10) × 10

uncertainty. Hence this experiment does not permit an analysis of the data of the form applied to the
Greenland and Nevada observations. The value of GN from this ocean experiment is shown in Fig.7
as experiment #12.

7 G Experiments

The new theory of gravity, given in (1) for the case of zero vorticity and in the non-relativistic limit,
is a two-parameter theory; G and α. Hence in experiments to determine G (or GN ) we expect to see
systematic discrepancies if the Newtonian theory is used to analyse the data. This is clearly the case
as shown in Fig.7 which shows the results of such analyses over the last 60 years. The fundamental
problem is that non-Newtonian eﬀects of size approximately ∆GN /GN ≈ α/4 are clearly evident, and
eﬀects of this size are expected from (1). To correctly analyse data from these experiments the full
theory in (1) must be used, and this would involve (i) computing the velocity ﬁeld for each conﬁgura-
tion of the test masses, and then (ii) computing the forces by using (3) to compute the acceleration
ﬁeld. These computations are far from simple, especially when the complicated matter geometries of
recent experiments need to be used. Essentially the ﬂow of space results in a non-Newtonian eﬀective
‘dark matter’ density in (5). This results in deviations from Newtonian gravity which are of order α/4.
The prediction is that when laboratory Cavendish-type experiments are correctly analysed the data
will permit the determination of both GN and α, and the large uncertainties in the determination of
GN will no longer occur. Until then the value of GN will continue to be the least accurately known
of all the fundamental constants. Despite this emerging insight CODATA8 in 2005 [20] reduced the
apparent uncertainties in GN by a factor of 10, and so ignoring the manifest presence of a system-
atic eﬀect. The occurrence of the ﬁne structure constant α, in giving the magnitude of the spatial
self-interaction eﬀect in (1), is a fundamental development in our understanding of 3-space and the
phenomenon of gravity. Indeed the implication is that α arises here as a manifestation of quantum
processes inherent in 3-space.

8 Some History

Here we have simply applied the new two-parameter theory of 3-space, and hence of gravity, to the
existing data from borehole experiments. However the history of these experiments shows that, of
course, the nature of the gravitational anomaly had not been understood, and so the implications
for fundamental physics that are now evident could not have been made. The ﬁrst indications that
some non-Newtonian eﬀect was being observed arose from Yellin [14] and Hinze et al.
[15]. It was
Stacey et al. in 1981 [16, 17, 18] who undertook systematic studies at the Mt.Isa Mine in Queensland,
Australia. In the end a mine site is very unsuited for such a gravitational anomaly experiment as by
their very nature mines have non-uniform poorly-known density and usually, as well, irregular surface
topography. In the end it was acknowledged that the Mt.Isa Mine data was unreliable. Nevertheless
those reports motivated the Greenland, Nevada and Ocean experiments, as well as above-ground
tower experiments [19], all with the assumption that the non-Newtonian eﬀects were being caused by
a modiﬁcation to Newton’s inverse square law by an additional short-range force - which also involved
the notion of a possible“5th-force” [21]. However these interpretations were not supported by the
data, and eventually the whole phenomenon of these gravitational borehole anomalies was forgotten.

9 Conclusions

We have extended the results from an earlier analysis [5, 6] of the Greenland Ice Shelf borehole g
anomaly data by correcting the density of ice from the assumed value to the actual value. This
brought the extracted value of α from approximately 1/139 to approximately 1/137, and so into
even closer agreement with the quantum theory value. As well the analysis was extended to the
Nevada borehole anomaly data, again giving α ≈ 1/137. This is signiﬁcant as the rock density is
more than twice the ice density. As well we have included the previous results [7] from analysis of
the blackhole masses in globular clusters and elliptical “spherical” galaxies, which gave α ≈ 1/134,
but with larger uncertainty. So the conclusion that α is actually the ﬁne structure constant from
quantum theory is now extremely strong. These results, together with the successful explanation for
the so-called spiral galaxy “dark-matter” eﬀect aﬀorded by the new theory of gravity, implies that
the Newtonian theory of gravity [1] is fundamentally ﬂawed, even at the non-relativistic level, and
that the disagreement with experiment and observation can be of fractional order α, or in the case
of spiral galaxies and blackholes, extremely large. This failure implies that General Relativity, which
reduces to the Newtonian theory in the non-relativistic limit, must also be considered as ﬂawed and
disproven.

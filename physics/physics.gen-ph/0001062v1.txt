Abstract

The correct perihelion precession was recently deduced within the
frame work of a time varying Gravitational constant G. Here, we de-
duce also the observed gravitational bending of light and ﬂattening of
galactic rotational curves.

1 Introduction

In a recent communication[1] we saw that it is possible to account for the
precession of the perihelion of Mercury, for example, only in terms of the
time varying universal constant of gravitation G. It may be mentioned that
Dirac had argued[2] that a time varying G could be reconciled with General
Relativity and the perihelion precession by considering a suitable redeﬁnition
of units. We will now show that it is also possible to account for the bending
of light on the one hand and on the other, the ﬂat galactic rotation curves
without invoking dark matter, with the same time variation of G.

2 Bending of Light

It may also be mentioned that some varying G cosmologies have been re-
viewed by Narlikar and Barrow, while a ﬂuctuational cosmology with the

above G variation has been considered by the author [3, 4, 5, 6] and [7].
We start by observing that, as is well known, the bending of light can be
deduced in Newtonian theory also, though the amount of bending is half of
that predicted by General Relativity[8, 9, 10, 11]. In this case the equations
for the orbit of a particle of mass m are used in the limit m → 0 with due
justiﬁcation. A quick way of obtaining the result is to observe that we have
the well known orbital equations[1, 12].

GM
L2 (1 + ecosΘ)

(1)

where M is the mass of the central object, L is the angular momentum
per unit mass, which in our case is bc, b being the impact parameter or
minimum approach distance of light to the object, and e the eccentricity of
the trajectory is given by

For the bending of light, if we substitute in (1), r = ±∞, and then use (2)
we get

α being the deﬂection or bending of the light. This is half the General
Relativistic value.
We also note that the eﬀect of time variation is given by (cf.ref.[1])

G = G0(1 −

), r = r0(1 −

)

(4)

where t0 is the present age of the universe and t is the time elapsed from the
present epoch.
Using (4) the well known equation for the trajectory is given by (Cf.[13],[12],[14])

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side represents the Newtonian contribution

while the remaining terms are the contributions due to (4). The solution of
(5) is given by

u =

GM

L2 (cid:20)1 + ecos(cid:26)(cid:18)1 −

t

2t0(cid:19) Θ + ω(cid:27)(cid:21)

(6)

where ω is a constant of integration. Corresponding to −∞ < r < ∞ in the
Newtonian case we have in the present case, −t0 < t < t0, where t0 is large
and inﬁnite for practical purposes. Accordingly the analogue of the reception
of light for the observer, viz., r = +∞ in the Newtonian case is obtained by
taking t = t0 in (6) which gives

u =

GM

L2 + ecos(cid:18)Θ

+ ω(cid:19)

(7)

Comparison of (7) with the Newtonian solution obtained by neglecting terms
∼ t/t0 in equations (4),(5) and (6) shows that the Newtonian Θ is replaced
by Θ
2 , whence the deﬂection obtained by equating the left side of (6) or (7)
to zero, is

t

2t0(cid:19) = −

cosΘ(cid:18)1 −

(8)

where e is given by (2). The value of the deﬂection from (8) is twice the
Newtonian deﬂection given by (3). That is the deﬂection α is now given not
by (3) but by

which is the correct General Relativistic Formula.

3 Galactic Rotation

The problem of galactic rotational curves is well known (cf.ref.[8]). We would
expect, on the basis of straightforward dynamics that the rotational velocities
at the edges of galaxies would fall oﬀ according to

whereas it is found that the velocities tend to a constant value,

v2 ≈

v ∼ 300km/sec

(10)

This has lead to the hypothesis of as yet undetected dark matter, that is that
the galaxies are more massive than their visible material content indicates.
We observe that from (4) it can be easily deduced that

a ≡ (¨ro − ¨r) ≈

to

(t ¨ro + 2 ˙ro) ≈ −2

(11)

as we are considering inﬁnitesimal intervals t and nearly circular orbits.
Equation (11) shows (Cf.ref[1] also) that there is an anomalous inward accel-
eration, as if there is an extra attractive force, or an additional central mass.
So,

From (12) it follows that

r !1/2

From (13) it is easily seen that at distances within the edge of a typical
galaxy, that is r < 1023cms the equation (9) holds but as we reach the edge
and beyond, that is for r ≥ 1024cms we have v ∼ 107cms per second, in
agreement with (10).
Thus the time variation of G given in equation (4) explains observation with-
out taking recourse to dark matter.

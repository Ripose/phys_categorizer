Abstract

We show a strong parallel between the Hawking, Beckenstein black
hole Thermodynamics and electromagnetism: When the gravitational
coupling constant transform into the electromagnetic coupling con-
stant, the Schwarzchild radius, the Beckenstein temperature, the Beck-
enstein decay time and the Planck mass transform to respectively the
Compton wavelength, the Hagedorn temperature, the Compton time
and a typical elementary particle mass. The reasons underlying this
parallalism are then discussed in detail.

A few decades ago, the work of Hawking, Beckenstein (and Unruh) and
others brought out the connection between Thermodynamics, Black holes
and Quantum Theory. We will now show that there is a striking parallel
between gravitation and thermodynamical considerations on the one hand
and electromagnetism on the other. We will then investigate the mechanism
that leads to such a parallelism. Our starting point is the well known relation
between the gravitational and electromagnetic coupling constants [1]

large number relations and for this purpose it does not really matter if m
stands for the mass of a pion or a proton or an electron (Cf.[1]).
It may
also be mentioned that (1) was considered to be a miraculous large number
coincidence along with a few other such relations. However in recent years it
has been shown that these relations can infact be deduced from the theory
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. As such they are not empirical or accidental. In fact this
theory correctly predicted an accelerating ever expanding universe with a
small cosmological constant, as was subsequently observationally found.
In this scheme it was independently deduced (Cf.ref.[2] et sequence) that

G =

lc2
√N m

=

lc2τ
mt ≡

Θ/t

(2)

wherein we have used the relation T = √Nτ , this being an analogue of
the Weyl-Eddington formula R = √Nl. Both these again are deduced from
theory rather than being ad hoc coincidences as earlier supposed. Equation
(2) shows the dependence of G on time, as in the Dirac and a few other
cosmologies (Cf. above references) and leads to meaningful observational
consequences including the otherwise unexplained anomalous accelerations
of the Pioneer spacecrafts [8, 9]. Equation (2) is just another form of (1).
It was also pointed out [10] that (2) shows up gravitation as an eﬀect of
electromagnetism spread over the N particles of the universe.
We can also see this in the following way. What we are saying is that if
1 then Gm2 can be replaced by e2. Carrying this out on (2) we get

substitution of (1) in (2).

We can compare (4) with (3) which deﬁnes l as what may be called the
“electromagnetic Schwarzschild” radius viz., the Compton wavelength, when
e2 is seen as an analogue of Gm2. To push these considerations further, we
have from the theory of black hole thermodynamics [11] for any arbitrary
mass m, ﬁrst the Beckenstein temperature given by

T =

Equation (5) gives the thermodynamic temperature of a Planck mass black
hole. Further, as is well known,

where β is given by

This leads back to the usual black hole life time given by

Let us now factor in the time variation of G into (6). Essentially we use (2).
Equation (6) now becomes

If we use the pion mass, m in (8), we get for t, the pion Compton time.
In fact if we use (2) in (5) with the appropriate expression for Θ, we get

Equation (9) is the well known relation expressing the Hagedorn temperature
of elementary particles [6]. It is an analogue of (5). Alternatively if we carry
out the substitution Gm2

instead of (6) we will get, with such a substitution,

which is again the pion Compton time. So the Compton time shows up as
an “electromagnetic Beckenstein radiation life time.”
Thus for elementary particles, working within the context of gravitational
theory, but with either a time varying Gravitational constant being taken
into consideration as in steps leading to (8) or alternatively a scaled up cou-
pling constant with the rule Gm2
e2, we get the meaningful relations (3)
and (8) and (9) giving the Compton length and Compton time as also the
Hagedorn temperature as the analogues of the Schwarzschild radius, radiation
life time and black hole temperature obtained with the usual gravitational
coupling constant. The converse holds good for e2
Gm2. The parallel is

complete. The analogy can be summarized as above.

REMARKS

1. It thus appears that gravitation plays out in the Beckenstein decay time
while electromagnetism plays out in the Compton time, though through the
same set of equations. One way of describing this phenomena is through (1),

4

which no longer needs to be considered as a coincidence. Let us introduce
two time scales (Cf. also [12]) tG and te. If we remember that the interaction
is represented by the Hamiltonian,

H(t) = ı¯h

then we have for the two time scales

Using (1) we now get

H(tG) =

H(te)

(11)

This is the bridge between the two interactions. Infact using this bridge in
(6), viz.,

We return to the time dependent gravitational constant as described after
equation (6) and as in the Dirac cosmology and as described in detail in
references [2, 3, 5]. The subsequent equations then get modiﬁed.
Another way of seeing this is by realizing that our time is the elementary
particle or “electromagnetic” time te. If we go to the gravitational “time”
tG then we have to replace in (8) t by √N t. This has an eﬀect of replacing
l in (8) by lP the Planck length. In this case we recover the Planck time as
the life time for a Planck mass mP on the one hand, and on the other, if the
1055gms, then we recover the life time as
mass were that of the universe
1017secs, that is the age of the universe.
2. It is interesting that we can pursue the gravito thermodynamic link with
electromagnetism further. Infact if we start with the Langevin equation in
a viscous medium [13, 14] then as the viscosity becomes vanishingly small,
it turns out that the Brownian particle moves according to Newton’s ﬁrst
law as if there were no force acting on it, that is with a constant velocity.
Moreover this constant velocity is given by (Cf.refs.[13, 14]), for any mass m,

We would like to study the case where m

formula [11] (5) We consider in (5) the entire universe so that the mass M
is

1055gms. Substitution in (5) gives

We next consider in (12),m to be the smallest possible mass allowed thermo-
dynamically. From thermodynamical considerations, Landsberg has shown
that this is given by [15]

The same equation (14) can also be obtained from a diﬀerent point of view,
namely the Planck scale underpinning for the universe in modern Quantum
Gravity approaches [4]. Substitution of (13) and (14) in (12) gives

v = c (cm/sec)

(15)

We can see from (12) and (15) that the velocity c is exactly the velocity of
light!
The question is, for how long such a particle with vanishingly small inertial
mass can maintain the constant velocity c, that is the velocity of light. Infact
the energy uncertainty mc2 is associated with the lifetime
¯h/mc2, the
Compton time. The Compton time for a particle with mass given by (14)
as can be easily checked is, 1017secs, which is the age of the universe! We
should recover the same result from (8) or (10), and indeed we do!
3. If we consider the gravitational self energy of an elementary particle m,
then this is given by

∼

It is easy to verify that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives

In (16) t is the age of the universe [6]. On the other hand the gravitational
self energy of all the N elementary particles in the universe is given by

Such a gravitational energy has a low Beckenstein temperature which for
mass m is given by (5) or (7).
Substitution of (17) shows that the life time t
time of the universe itself.
4. In the introduction, reference was made to the work of Unruh. He discov-
ered that an uniformly accelerating object shows an event horizon and the
consequent Beckenstein temperature is given by [16],

1017secs, that is the life

∼

T = ¯ha/2πkc

(18)

It is interesting to note that in (18) if we replace the uniform acceleration a
by the uniform acceleration of rotation,

a = v2/r

and further take v to be c and r to be successively l, the Compton length
or R the Schwarzchild radius of a black hole, then we recover respectively
the Hagedorn temperature for an elementary particle and the Beckenstein
temperature (5) for a black hole.
There is another interesting fact. Let us, in (18), take a to be ΛR, where Λ
is the cosmological constant and R the radius of the universe. Then, using
the value (13) for T (the Beckenstein temperature for the mass M of the
universe), we get the correct value

Λ

H 2

c2/R2

∼

∼
where H is the Hubble constant. This should not be surprising because the
acceleration a in (18) is in the context of the universe, caused by the vaccum
or dark energy.
On the other hand if we apply the Unruh formula (18) to the viscous zero
point ﬁeld, as in considerations of point 2, we recover the Hagedorn formula.
5. We note that the relation

c2 ∼
which follows from (10) on using the expression for the Compton time for t
gives an estimate for the ﬁne structure constant
6. We have mentioned that gravitation is a form of weak electromagnetism.
One way in which this can be understood is by realizing that the universe
is by and large electrically neutral, because the atoms consist of an equal

number of positive and negative charges. Strictly speaking these atoms are
therefore electrical dipoles.
With this background let us consider the following simple model of an elec-
trically neutral atom which nevertheless has a dipole eﬀect. Infact as is well
known from elementary electrostatics the potential energy at a distance r
due to the dipole is given by

∼

∼

10−8cm

103l = βl, e being the electric charge of the
where µ = eL, L
electron for simplicity and l being the electron Compton wavelength. (There
is a factor cosΘ with µ, but on an integration over all directions, this becomes
an irrelevant constant factor 4π.)
Due to (19), the potential energy of a proton p (which approximates an atom
in terms of mass) at the distance r (much greater than L) is given by

As there are N
proton due to all the dipoles is given by

∼

1080 atoms in the universe, the net potential energy of a

In (21) we use the fact that the predominant eﬀect comes from the distant
atoms which are at a distance
We now use the well known Eddington formula encountered earlier,

r being of the order of the dimension of the universe. If we introduce (22) in
(21) we get, as the energy E of the proton under consideration

Let us now consider the gravitational potential energy E′ of the proton p due
to all the other N atoms in the universe. This is given by

Comparing (23) and (24), not only is E equal to E′, but remembering that

7. In earlier communications, we had considered the Modiﬁed Uncertainty
Principle which is there in Quantum Gravity approaches, including that of
the author and also in Quantum Super String theory [17, 18, 19].
It was
argued that the Modiﬁed Uncertainty Principle is

∆x =

¯h
∆p

+ L2 ∆p
¯h

(25)

with a similar equation for the time coordinate, where L stands for the Planck
length or more generally the Compton length.
It was argued that while the ﬁrst term on the right side of (25) gives the
usual Uncertainty Principle of Heisenberg, the extra term is the contribution
of gravitational eﬀects. We can easily see that an application of the second
term to the time coordinate leads us back to point 1 of this section, if we
recognize that ∆E = √Nmc2, √N being the ﬂuctuation or uncertainty in
the number of particles in the universe.

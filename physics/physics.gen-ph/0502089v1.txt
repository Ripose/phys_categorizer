NO GW IS EMITTED BY B PSR1913+16

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. In the exact (non-linear) formulation of general relativity
(GR) no motion of bodies can give origin to gravitational waves (GW’s)
– as it has been proved. Accordingly, the measured rate of change of the
orbital period of binary pulsar B PSR1913+16 must have other causes,
diﬀerent from the emission of GW’s; maybe the viscous losses of the
unseen pulsar companion, if it were e.g. a helium star.

Summary. - The paper is structured as follows. Sect.1. contains some
passages of a recent report by Weisberg and Taylor (see [1g)] regarding
thirty years of observations of binary radiopulsar B PSR1913+16. Sect.2.:
a straightforward criticism of the relativistic approach which is employed
in papers cited in [1]. Sect.2bis.: a possible alternative explanation of the
shrinkage of the orbit of the above radiopulsar. Sect.3.: the linear approxi-
mation of GR is inadequate to give an existence theorem of physical GW’s.
Sect.4.: system B PSR1913+16 cannot emit GW’s. Sect.5.: the analogy
between Maxwell-Lorentz e.m. theory and the linearized version of GR is a
false analogy. Sect.6.: erroneousness of a surmise concerning the behaviour
of B PSR1913+16.

1.

- Nobody has ever found a direct experimental proof of the real
existence of the gravitational waves (GW’s). According to some authors [1],
an indirect experimental evidence could be given by the time decrease of
the orbital period Pb of the binary pulsar B PSR1913+16 [1bis].

The abstract of paper [1g)] runs as follows: “We describe results derived
from thirty years of observations of PSR B1913+16. Together with the
Keplerian orbital parameters, measurements of the relativistic periastron
advance and a combination of gravitational redshift and time dilation yield
the stellar masses with high accuracy. The measured rate of change of orbital
period agrees with that expected from the emission of gravitational radia-
tion, according to general relativity, to within about 0.2 percent. Systematic
eﬀects depending on the pulsar distance and on poorly known galactic con-
stants now dominate the error budget, so tighter bounds will be diﬃcult to

energy in the form of gravitational waves. The loss of orbital energy results
in shrinkage of the orbit, which is most easily observed as a decrease in
orbital period. Peters and Mathews (1963) (see [2]) showed that in general
relativity the rate of period decrease is given by

Here: G is the gravitational constant; c the speed of light in vacuo;
e the orbital eccentricity (e = 0.6171338(4)); mp the mass of the pulsar
(mp = 1.4414 ± 0.0002 solar masses), mc the mass of the companion (mc =
1.3867 ± 0.0002 solar masses).

Then, Weisberg and Taylor [1g)] write: “Comparison of the measured
˙Pb,Gal, for relative
˙Pb with the theoretical value requires a small correction,
acceleration between the solar system and binary pulsar system, projected
onto the line of sight (Damour and Taylor 1991) [see[1e)]]. This correc-
tion is applied to the measured ˙Pb to form a “corrected value” ˙Pb,corrected =
˙Pb − ˙Pb,Gal. The correction term depends on several rather poorly known
quantities, including the distance [≈ 16, 000 light-years] and proper motion
of the pulsar and the radius of the Sun’s galactic orbit. The best cur-
rently available values yield ˙Pb,Gal = −(0.0128 ± 0.0050) × 10−12 s/s, so that
˙Pb,corrected = 2.4056 ± 0.0051) × 10−12 s/s. Hence

˙Pb,corrected
˙Pb,GR

= 1.0013 ± 0.0021,

and we conclude that the measured orbital decay is consistent at the
(0.13 ± 0.21) % level with the general relativistic prediction for the emission
of gravitational radiation. [. . .].”

2.

- The good agreement between the measured ˙Pb and the computed
˙Pb is suspect – as I have already emphasized [3] –, because the relativistic
perturbative approximation, of which eq.(1) is a consequence, is quite unre-
liable from the point of view of the exact (non-linear) formulation of GR,
as it was pointed out by several relativists [3bis].

Further, I remark that in GR the hypothetic GW’s do not have a true
energy. Therefore the true mechanical energy which is lost during the orbital
motion should transform itself into the pseudo (i.e.
false) energy of the
hypothetic GW’s: the energy balance would be violated. Objection: if we
suppose that the linearized version of GR has an unconditioned, approximate
validity – as the experimentalists, and some (simple) theoreticians [4], do –
the physical existence of GW’s seems a theoretical possibility, and it seems
– by exploiting the analogy with Maxwell-Lorentz e.m. theory – that the
acceleration of a body can generate GW’s. Answer : the energy-momentum
of such GW’s has a tensor character only under Lorentz transformations of

3

co-ordinates, but not under general transformations. Now, this is contrary
to the basic tenet of GR.

2bis. - The authors of papers [1] have assumed that both stars of the con-
sidered binary system are neutron stars, and thus act dynamically as point
masses. But if the companion star were a helium star or a white dwarf, tides
and viscous actions might mimic the relativistic (as the periastron advance)
and pseudorelativistic eﬀects. In particular, the viscous losses of the com-
panion could give a time decrease of the pulsar revolution period of the same
order of magnitude of that given by the hypothesized emission of gravita-
tional radiation – as it is well known to many observational astrophysicists.
Finally, the empirical success of a theory – or of a given computation – is
not an absolute guaranty for its conceptual adequacy. Consider for instance
the Ptolemaic theory of cycles and epicycles, which explained rather well
the planetary orbits (with the only exception of Mercury’s).

3. - It can be proved that the linear approximation of GR is quite ina-
dequate to a proper study of the hypothetic GW’s, see [5], [6]. And if we
continue the approximation beyond the linear stage (see [7], [8]), we ﬁnd
that the radiation terms of the gravitational ﬁeld can be destroyed by con-
venient co-ordinate transformations: this proves that the GW’s are only a
product of a special choice of the reference system, i.e. that they do not pos-
sess a physical reality (see further [9], [10], [11]): the undulatory solutions
of Einstein ﬁeld equations have a mere formal (non-physical) character.

4. - If the two stars of B PSR1913+16 are dynamically treated as two
(gravitationally interacting) point masses [1], the exact formulation of GR
tells us that their orbits are geodetic lines [9], i.e. their motions are “natu-
ral”, “free” motions, quite analogous to a rectilinear and uniform motion of
a point charge in the customary Maxwell-Lorentz theory. Accordingly, no
GW is sent forth by our stars! [10], [11].

In my paper [3β)] I have given another elegant proof of this fact, resting
on a fundamental proposition by Hermann Weyl [12], according to which for
any relative motion of two bodies it is always possible (in GR) to choose a
co-ordinate system in which both bodies are at rest. (Remark that in GR
the expression at rest must be deﬁned precisely by specifying the interested
spacetime manifold.)

Let us apply the above proposition to system B PSR1913+16, i.e.
let
us choose a co-ordinate frame for which both stars are at rest. Evidently,
an observer Ω who “resides” in this frame does not record any emission
of GW’s. Now, any observer Ω′ – very far, in particular, from Ω –, for
whom B PSR1913+16 is in motion, does not possess (in GR!) any physical
privilege with respect to Ω. Accordingly, both observers, Ω and Ω′, do not
register any GW sent forth by our binary system. (See Weyl [13] for the
Riemann-Einstein manifold of two point masses at rest.)

5. - The false formal analogy between the e.m. Maxwell-Lorentz theory
and the linearized version of GR is the responsible for the publication of

4

countless and senseless papers. In particular, it has generated the conviction
that, in GR, the acceleration of a body must give origin to GW’s; many
people have forgotten that, in the exact (non-linear) formulation of GR,
the concept “acceleration” does not possess an absolute character.
(The
above conviction was also extended to perturbative approximations of higher
order.)

We observe ﬁnally that the exact theory does not admit any class of phy-
sically privileged reference frames for which, in particular, the undulatory
character of a given gravitational ﬁeld is an invariant property.

6. - A last remark. Some authors have conjectured that a coexistence of
eﬀects due to emission of GW’s by B PSR1913+16 and to tides and viscous
actions of the companion star could be possible.

Now, this is pure nonsense, because – as it can be proved – even motions

that are not purely gravitational cannot generate GW’s [14].

An Elementary Derivation of the Harmonic Oscillator Propagator

The harmonic oscillator propagator is found straightforwardly from the free particle propagator,
within the imaginary-time Feynman path integral formalism. The derivation presented here is ex-
tremely simple, requiring only elementary mathematical manipulations and no clever use of Hermite
polynomials, annihilation & creation operators, cumbersome determinant evaluations or any kind
of involved algebra.

It is a current opinion that evaluations of the simple
harmonic oscillator propagator are somewhat tricky. In
fact, up to the author’s knowledge, the usual arguments
[1, 2] conﬁrm this belief to some extent. Our aim in
this short note is to establish an alternative derivation
of the euclidean harmonic oscillator propagator, which is
technically very elementary. All one needs to know is the
standard expression for the imaginary-time free particle
propagator,

In (2), the time interval T has been sliced into N pieces,
with sizes ǫi ≡ ti − ti−1. We are interested to compute
the imaginary-time harmonic oscillator propagator,

The exponential factor exp(−2ωt) which appears above
can be absorbed by time reparametrization. Let t⋆ ≡

[3] The choice ¯ti = (ti+ti−1)/2 is indeed the only prescription
that leads to a time translational invariant propagator.

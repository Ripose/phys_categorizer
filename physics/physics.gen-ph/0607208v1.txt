Abstract

De Broglie believed that the photon has a mass, a view shared by
a few others. Quite recently, the author has argued that the photon
has a mass which is consistent with the latest experimental limits. In
the present paper we point out that there is experimental evidence
for this mass and also give a theoretical demonstration of the photon
mass.

1 Introduction

As is well known the concept of the photon grew out of the work of Planck
and Einstein, though its earliest origin was in Newton’s Corpuscular Theory.
Thereafter the photon got integrated into twentieth century physics, be it
Classical or Quantum. Though it is considered to be a massless particle of
spin 1 and 2 helicity states (as proved later for any massless particle with spin
by Wigner), it is interesting to note that there had been diﬀerent dissenting
views.
De Broglie himself [1] believed that the photon has a mass, a view shared
by a few others as well. An apparent objection to this view has been that
a photon mass would be incompatible with Special Relativity. However it
is interesting to note that nowhere in twentieth century physics has it been
proved that the photon has no mass [2]. It would be correct to say that there
are a number of experimental limits to the mass of the photon. These limits
have become more and more precise [3, 4]. The best limit so far is given by
mγ < 10−57gm

(1)

1

that is, the photon mass would be very small indeed!
It may also be mentioned that there has been a more radical view that the
photon itself is superﬂuous [5, 6, 7, 8].
The author himself has argued very much on the lines of de Broglie, that the
photon has a small mass given by

mγ = 10−65gm

(2)

This conclusion follows from a Planck scale underpinning model and is com-
patible with special relativity [9, 10, 11, 12]. Curiously enough, from the
completely diﬀerent point of view of Thermodynamics, Landsberg had shown
that the mass in (2) is the smallest possible mass in the universe [13]. In any
case (2) is compatible with (1).
It is interesting to note that the mass of the photon given in (2) has some
experimental support. This mass would imply a dispersive eﬀect in High En-
ergy Cosmic Rays which we receive from deep outer space - and it appears
that we may already be observing such eﬀects [10, 14].
This apart another experimental evidence for the photon mass (2) comes
from laboratory diﬀraction experiments [15].
Finally it may be mentioned that this photon mass would imply that the
Coulomb potential becomes a short range Yukawa potential with a range
∼ 1028cms, that is the radius of the universe itself. Such a Yukawa potential
would lead to a small shift in the hyperﬁne energy levels as shown elsewhere
[16].

2 Further Theoretical Support

We now give a further theoretical justiﬁcation for the above. We ﬁrst observe
that as is well known [17], Maxwell’s equations can be written in the following
form

(3)

(4)

(5)

Equations (3) to (5) will be useful in the sequel.
We next observe that Maxwell’s equations have been deduced in a fashion

Ψ = ~E + ı ~B,
~∇ × Ψ = ı ˙Ψ
~∇ · Ψ = 0

2

very similar to the Dirac equation, from ﬁrst principles [18]. In this deduc-
tion, we use the usual energy momentum relation for the photon

E2 − p2c2 = 0

and introduce matrices given in

It is then easy to verify (Cf.ref.[18]) that with the substitution of the usual
Quantum Mechanical energy momentum operators, we recover equations (3)
to (5) for Ψ and its complex conjugate.

Recently a similar analysis has lead to the same conclusion. In fact it has
been shown that under a Lorentz boost [19],

We would like to point out that equations (4), (5), (8) to (12) display the
symmetry

p → −p , Ψ → Ψ∗

We now invoke the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer formalism (Cf.[19]) which gives,
for a Lorentz boost equations

(13)

(14)

where the subscripts R and L refer to the states of opposite helicity, that is
left and right polarised light in our case.
We now observe that equations (12) and (13)-(14) are identical, but there is a
curious feature in both of these, that is that the photon of electromagnetism
is now seen to have a mass m.

3 Discussion

It is interesting to note that it has been demonstrated that the mass of the
photon is incompatible with the magnetic monopole [20]. Indeed the author
himself has presented diﬀerent arguments to the eﬀect that there are no
magnetic monopoles [21]. It may be mentioned that Dirac the originator of
the idea of the magnetic monopole, himself expressed his pessimism about
the existence of the magnetic monopole as long back as 1981, during the
ﬁftieth year of the monopole seminar [22].
Returning to the mass of the photon, it can be argued that this is a result
of the non commutativity of spacetime at a micro scale. We observe that a
photon mass would imply the equation

∂µFµν = −m2Aν,

(15)

4

where we have the usual equations of electromagnetism

We note that from (17) we get

∂µAµ = 0,

Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ

∂µFµν = DAν − ∂µ∂νAµ

(16)

(17)

(18)

where D denotes the D’Alembertian. In view of (16), the second term on
the right side of (18) would vanish, provided the derivates commute. In this
case we would return to the usual Maxwell equations. However in the non
commutative case this extra term is

p2Aµ ∼ m2Aµ

remembering that we are in units c = 1 = ¯h.
Thus because of the non commutativity we get (15) instead, of the usual
Maxwell equation.
The question of non commutativity and mass generation in the context of
gauge theory has been studied by the author elsewhere (Cf.[23, 24, 12]).
In any case the above points to the fact that there would be no massless
particles in nature. The point is, that in an idealized situation in which the
radius R → ∞, the mass mγ → 0.

APPENDIX

1. Non Commutativity and Mass Generation:

Our starting point is the Dirac equation (using natural units c = 1 = ¯h),

(γµpµ) ψ = 0

(19)

Remembering that the operator in (19) is

we multiply on the left side by

γ◦p◦ − ~γ◦~p,

γ◦p◦ + ~γ◦~p

term which leads to the massless Klein-Gordon or D’Alembertian operator.
The second term is well known in a non relativistic approximation with a
small external magnetic ﬁeld that is switched on, this term leads to a spin
orbit coupling. It is the third and last term that is the extra eﬀect due to
the noncommutative character of spacetime, that is due to the fact

We identify this extra term with the mass term, viz.,

Bµν = [pµ, pν] 6= 0

γıγ◦Bı◦ = m2

(21)

(22)

We will justify this identiﬁcation in a moment. With this identiﬁcation, and
in the absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld, in which case the second term in
(20) disappears, (20) goes over to the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive
particle.
Infact it has already been discussed in detail that in the above noncommu-
tative case, (21),

Bµν = pµpν − pνpµ = ∂µ∂ν − ∂ν∂µ = eFµν

(23)

where Fµν is the usual electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor. (The deep relation of
(23) with the Weyl gauge invariant electromagnetic potential has also been
discussed in detail in the above references). Because of (23) and because of
the fact that,

γıγ◦ = αı
where ~α denotes the velocity operator, at the Compton wavelength where
momentum is m(= mc), the extra term becomes

e2
l2 ∼ m2
in agreement with (22) due to the deﬁnition of the Compton length as the
electron radius viz.,

l ∼ e2/m ∼

1
m

The massive Klein-Gordon equation then, in the usual formulation leads back
to the Dirac equation (19) but this time with the usual mass term.

2. An Experimental Test for the Photon Mass:

It is well known that for a massive vector ﬁeld interacting with a magnetic
dipole of moment M, for example the earth itself, we would have with the
usual notation

A(x) =

M × k

B =

(cid:21)
Considerations like this have yielded in the past an upper limit for the photon
mass, for instance 10−48gms and 10−57gms. Nevertheless (24) can be used
for a precise determination of the photon mass. It may be mentioned here
that contrary to popular belief, there is no experimental evidence to indicate
that the photon mass is zero!

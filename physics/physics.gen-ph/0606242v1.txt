An alternative to the principle of constant speed of light

Herbert Weiß

(Dated: February 20, 2014)

To consider a medium carrying light and electromagnetic waves is nearly impossible, when this
medium shall have properties according to the principle of constant speed of light, that is, isotropy
of speed of light in every system of reference. The properties of light propagation are determined by
the synchronization scheme applied to the clocks of the reference system. Therefore, with principle
of constant speed of light abandoned, the so-called medium-synchronization is deﬁned, which yields
isotropy of speed of light solely in the system at rest. In all moving systems, however, anisotropy of
speed of light is found, quite as expected from a realistic medium. By means of medium-synchroni-
zation the appropriate coordinate transformation is developed, the medium-transformation, which is
not an opposite to Lorentz-transformation, but a meaningful amendment yielding reasonable results
when applied on Maxwell equations. Although medium-transformation violates Lorentz-invariance,
it is shown that a realistic medium is compatible not only with medium-transformation but also
with Lorentz-transformation and with theory of special relativity.

INTRODUCTION

After prediction of electromagnetic waves by J. C.
Maxwell and their demonstration by Heinrich Hertz it
has been obvious to assume a medium carrying those
waves, thus many attempts have been made on measur-
ing a drift velocity of the earth with respect to that me-
dium, but all of them failed. Albert Einstein solved this
problem with the principle of constant speed of light, an
axiom leading to Lorentz-transformation and to the well-
known and very successful theory of special relativity [1].

The principle of constant speed of

light demands
isotropy of speed of light in every inertial system, which
is unfortunately incompatible with the properties of a re-
alistic medium, thus a medium moved out of the focus of
science and no more serious research has been done on
that subject. But anyway, two charged bodies or sim-
ply two massive bodies some distance apart exert forces
to each other, forces, which must be carried by some-
thing concrete. Light and also particles have properties
of waves that give rise to ask for the oscillating mat-
ter. On one hand only a medium can explain the nature
of forces and electromagnetic waves, on the other hand
general isotropy of speed of light makes it impossible to
consider a realistic medium. One way to get out of this
dilemma is to change the demand for general isotropy of
speed of light, so we have to ask: is the principle of con-
stant speed of light the only possible presupposition to
achieve a transformation of coordinates complying with
observable phenomena or is there an alternative given
compatible with the concept of a realistic medium?

General isotropy of speed of light is realized by apply-
ing Einstein-synchronization on the clocks in every iner-
tial system. It is not a naturally given phenomenon but
a manually determined. The synchronization scheme of
clocks is responsible for the properties of light propaga-

tion, nothing else, so we will have a look more closer on
the methods of synchronization, which conditions must
be met by the synchronization method to comply with
observable phenomena. Then we have to chose a syn-
chronization scheme applicable for diﬀerent systems of
reference and compatible with the properties of a realis-
tic medium. Assuming there is at least one such scheme,
we have to ﬁnd the appropriate transformation of coor-
dinates from one reference system into another system.
Finally, we have to prove the properties of the coordinate
transformation, for example, by applying it on Maxwell
equations. Only when the transformed equations show
properties complying with observable phenomena, we can
say, there is a way out of this dilemma.

The main subject of this paper is, in fact, the medium,
but the medium itself isn’t discussed at all. This might
be unsatisfactory to readers, who want come to know
something about the medium. Therefore we added ap-
pendix D giving a brief description of our current ideas
to a model of the medium. But we have to underline, it
is far from being a theory of the medium, appendix D is
only a concise summary of ideas.

A. Formalism and system of units

All equations are shown exclusively in SI units us-
ing three-vectors with time as a regular parameter. In
fact, there is a reason for treating time diﬀerent from
position coordinates, because time is strictly monotone,
the direction of ﬂow is never reversed unlike, for exam-
ple, the movement of a mechanical oscillator. Regarding
any process a particular position coordinate can occure
more than once, a particular time coordinate only once.
We don’t use four-dimensional notation with Lorentz-
invariant Minkowsky spacetime, because medium-trans-
formation violates Lorentz-invariance (and I have to ad-

mit being not sure whether Minkowsky spacetime applies
in this case). Time coordinates will be denoted by up-
percase indices (tA, tB,...), time diﬀerences, i.e., elapsed
times, by lowercase indices (tg, th, tr,...). Figures 2, 4,
5, and 9 are showing space-time-like coordinate systems.
World lines of locations are represented by thin dotted
lines, locations belonging to the system at rest as well as
events are denoted by uppercase letters (A, B, C,...), and
locations belonging to the moving system are denoted by
primed uppercase letters (A′, B′, C′,...).

II. REFERENCE SYSTEM

We frequently use the terms reference system, inertial
system and coordinate system. To avoid misunderstand-
ings we give the deﬁnitions of these terms according to
Mittelstaedt [2].

A. Reference system and inertial system

A reference system S in our sense is a rigid material
basis equipped with clocks and measuring-rods. A special
kind of a reference system is an inertial system I, this is
a space-time-like reference system, where noninteracting
mass points k1, k2, ...kn are moving uniformly on straight
lines [2, p. 35].

B. Coordinate system

By means of a coordinate system K every point P of
space a position vector r is assigned (see II B 1). Together
with time t given by the local clocks a space-time-like co-
ordinate system K (r, t) is deﬁned. Here, we use only
coordinate systems ﬂoating along with the reference sys-
tem I (the material basis), i.e., coordinate sytems, where
position coordinates r (PI ) of locations PI belonging to
the reference system I are constant, independent of time:
∂r (PI ) /∂t = 0.—As an example, the lab including an
optical bench is a system of reference and the coordinate
system may be established by rulers mounted on the op-
tical bench.—Furthermore we restrict on right-basis or-
thogonal coordinate systems. For short we denote such a
coordinate system as frame, i.e., the right-basis orthogo-
nal coordinate system at rest will be denoted as the frame
at rest.

of the z-axis is determined by the x- and y-axis due to
the requirements for a right-basis orthogonal coordinate
system. The position vector r is the sum of the three
vectors x, y, and z, Eq. (1). Vector x is aligned with the
x-axis, vector y is aligned with the y-axis, and vector z
is aligned with the z-axis.

2. Coordinate transformation

We need at least three points to determine the three
axes of coordinate system K0, ﬁrst the origin O of our
coordinate system, second a point Px giving the direction
of the x-axis by line OPx, and third a point Py giving
the direction of the y-axis by line OPy, whereas point
Py has to be chosen in such a manner that the y-axis

In order to distinguish magnitudes from diﬀerent co-
ordinate systems, we denote magnitudes of the system
at rest K0 by regular, unprimed symbols (r, x, y, z, t),
and we denote magnitudes of other coordinate systems
K ′, especially of moving systems, by primed symbols

(r′, x′, y′, z′, t′). Position vector r from Eq. (3) identi-
ﬁes point P with respect to coordinate system K0. The
same point of space is identiﬁed by vector r′ belong-
ing to coordinate system K ′ given by Eq. (4). See also
Fig. 8. Measuring-rod M ′ used in coordinate system K ′
and measuring-rod M are assumed to have equal proper-
ties. Exchanging the measuring-rods must not aﬀect the
values of the coordinates measured.

Coordinates x′, y′, and z′ of vector r′ are calculated
from coordinates x, y, z of vector r by applying the ap-
propriate coordinate transformation. When the position
of point P depends on time in any of the two involved
coordinate systems, the time coordinates also have to be
taken into account. Thus the general form of a coordinate
transformation gives the relation of coordinates x′, y′, z′,
and t′ of the (moving) system K ′ to the coordinates x,
y, z, and t of the system (at rest) K0, and vice versa.

3. Time coordinate

The time coordinate t of our reference system is repre-
sented by the clocks and their zero position settings. We
have to choose the time coordinate in such a manner, that
noninteracting mass points are moving uniformly, that is,
when the time-path diagrams of all those mass points are
straight lines. We assume, all our clocks are of identical
construction but initially with randomly distributed zero
position settings. To achieve a reasonable common time
coordinate for our reference system, we have to adjust the
zero positions settings of all clocks in order to be able to
measure the constant velocity of the above mentioned
uniformly moving mass points. This kind of adjustment
the zero positions we call synchronization of clocks.

3

coordinates we calculate the velocities vh and vr and fur-
thermore the oﬀset for synchronization of the clock. This
procedure has to be repeated for all clocks in our inertial
system.

Another synchronization method appearing in litera-
ture is done by slowly transport of clocks [2, p. 115]. The
problem with this method is that the clocks have to move
inﬁnitely slowly, which is not practicable. At ﬁnite ve-
locities the clocks no more transport pure Lorentz-time,
therefore, this kind of synchronization will not be dis-
cussed here. Lorentz-time is the time given by the clocks
in an Einstein-synchronized inertial system K0. A clock
is said to transport Lorentz-time when the reading of the
moving clock is always the same as the reading of a sta-
tionary clock of system K0 at the instant the two clocks
meet. For some details about the transport of clocks at
real speed see appendix C.

Our facility can be a massive body as well as a sig-
nal traveling as wave. The most commonly used ’facility’
for synchronization of clocks are light signals. No mat-
ter, which facility is used, we have always to know ex-
actly the relation vh/vr, otherwise our synchronization
result will be ambiguous. We mention this point, be-
cause with light signals we just have this situation, the
relation vh/vr is not known because the speed of the ’car-
rier’ of the signals with respect to our system of reference
cannot be measured (see below). To overcome this prob-
lem, we have to introduce something like a rule giving
us the relation vh/vr. Before we are talking about such
rules, we will have a look at the results concerning the
experiments for measuring a drift velocity of the earth
(our system of reference) with respect to a medium (our
carrier), and we mention brieﬂy the results of measure-
ment of speed of light. Then we describe the synchro-
nization procedure with light signals in detail and show
two applicable ’rules’, i.e., schemes of synchronization:
Einstein-synchronization and medium-synchronization.

A. Measurement of drift velocity

III. SYNCHRONIZATION OF CLOCKS

To synchronize all the clocks we have to select one
particular clock, for instance, the clock at the origin O
of our coordinate system, to be the reference clock. The
distances of all other clocks to this reference clock are
given by the position coordinates of the clocks. Then we
need a facility moving uniformly at constant velocity vh
along a straight line crossing the origin as well as the po-
sition of the clock to be synchronized. Both clocks store
the time at the instant the facility is passing. When our
facility has passed the second clock, the movement is re-
versed and our facility drifts back at constant velocity vr
on the same path passing both clocks in opposite order.
Again, both clocks store its time at the instant the fa-
cility is passing. By means of the given relation vh/vr,
the positions of the clocks, and the locally recorded time

After discovery of electromagnetic waves and the wave
properties of light, there have been a lot of attempts on
measuring the drift velocity of the earth with respect to a
medium. The most popular of all was that of Michelson
and Morley [3], but all experiments had the same result:
there was no drift velocity measurable, independent from
the orientation of the legs of the interferometer.

There are several hypothesis to explain this result, but
only two are of interest:—Albert Einstein assumed that
speed of light in vacuum has generally the same mag-
nitude, regardless to the direction and regardless to the
moving state of the observer. He couldn’t explain this
behaviour, and guided by the experimental results he
treated his assumption as an axiom and rised it to the
principle of constant speed of light. Einstein neglected
the need for a medium, a luminiferous aether, because
there is no velocity vector known to be assigned to a point

of space, where electromagnetic processes take place, he
said. And in fact, the principle of constant speed of light
leads to a consistant theory of coordinate transforma-
tion, the well-known theory of special relativity.—H. A.
Lorentz (and formerly FitzGerald) assumed the legs of
the interferometer in the drift direction being shortened
by an amount, which compensates for the longer prop-
agation time in that leg. Lorentz successfully employed
this assumption to describe electromagnetic phenomena
in moving systems [4]. He concluded a drift velocity
of any magnitude cannot be measured by the method
of Michelson and Morley (and all equivalent methods).
This explanation sounds slightly strange, but Lorentz-
transformation as derived and used in theory of special
relativity just reveals such a behaviour of our material
basis.

At this time principle of constant speed of light is the
only explanation for the results of the Michelson and
Morley experiment, and we have to admit that the re-
sults prefer this kind of explanation. But we will show
that another explanation is possible and reasonable, an
explanation giving properties to space similar to those of
a medium and leading to a behaviour of bodies just as
supposed by Lorentz. Despite the fact that Michelson
and Morley measured a drift velocity of zero at all pos-
sible conditions, we suppose a drift velocity is not mea-
surable by this method, so we assume the drift velocity
being still unknown.

B. Measurement of speed of light

The experiments designed for measuring speed of light
use a closed loop path, so that the propagation time of the
light signal can be measured by a single clock. Thus we
can only measure the mean of speed of light. For empty
space this mean value is denoted by c0 and is given by
the sum of all distances si the light signal travels divided
by the sum of all propagation times ti of that closed loop
path (5).

Although the experiments diﬀer in the number of paths
and the directions, the mean of speed of light in empty
space has always the same value of c0, regardless to the
orientation and to the state of movement the appara-
tus has with respect to the medium. For the simplest
arrangement comprising only two paths of equal length
l the mean of speed of light in vacuum c0 is given by
Eq. (6).

a light pulse emitted from A, traveling to B and back to A
after reﬂection at B. The instant of reﬂection tB(2) can have
any value between emission at tA(1) and absorption at tA(3).
Due to Eq. (10) the corresponding synchronization parameter
ε must range from 0 to 1.

C. Synchronization method using light signals

The simplest arrangement for synchronization of two
clocks in a system utilizes one single path in both direc-
tions. Consider a rod of lenght l with a light emitter at
the end A and a mirror at the other end B. On both ends
are clocks with equal properties. The clock at A shows
time tA, the clock at B shows time tB. A light signal
starts at A at time tA(1), travels to point B, is reﬂected
at B at time tB(2), travels back and is absorbed at A at
time tA(3). The whole propagation time tg of the light
pulse from emission at A to the absorption back at A is
the diﬀerence of tA(3) and tA(1) (7).

(7)

(8)

The propagation time th of the signal between emission
at A and reﬂection at B is given by the diﬀerence of tB(2)
and tA(1) (8).

th = tB(2) − tA(1)

Because the speed of light ch in this direction is un-
known the time tB(2) is unknown as well, and it is im-
portant to keep in mind that there are any assumptions
possible for the instant of reﬂection as long as tB(2) is
within the limits tA(1) and tA(3). The instant of reﬂection
has to be after the instant of emission, and the instant
of absorption has to be after the instant of reﬂection (9)
in order to conserve the topology of time.

tA(1) ≤ tB(2) ≤ tA(1)

(9)

(5)

tg = tA(3) − tA(1)

For all further considerations it is useful to deﬁne the
synchronization parameter ε given by the relation of the
propagation time th to the total propagation time tg (10).

(10)

Due to condition (9) ε must be within the limits 0 and

1. For more details see [2, p. 51].

0 ≤ ε ≤ 1

(11)

Now, the clock at B is synchronized with the clock at
A by choosing the time of reﬂection tB(2) at B according
to Eq. (12) with the synchronization parameter ε set to
a particular value between 0 and 1. As long as ε meets
condition (11) the results of synchronization comply with
observable phenomena.

tB(2) = tA(1) + ε

tA(3) − tA(1)

(12)

(cid:0)
The synchronization parameter ε can also be expressed
in terms of the speed of light. If we introduce the value
ch for the speed of light in the direction from A to B,
and the value cr for the speed of light in the opposite
direction according to Eqs. (13) and (14)

(cid:1)

ch =

cr =

tA(3) − tB(2)

ε =

ch + cr

(13)

(14)

(15)

then from Eq. (10) the synchronization parameter ε is
given by Eq. (15) featuring only the speed of light in the
direction there and back of a given distance.

The synchronization parameter ε is a measure for the
anisotropy of speed of light in the direction given by the
axis of the rod.

D. Synchronization schemes

We assume there is more than one inertial system, and
all systems are moving at diﬀerent velocities with respect
to each other. Because there are no restrictions in chos-
ing a value for the synchronization parameter ε, except
that give by cond. (11), any of these inertial systems can
be declared to be the stationary system I0. To achieve
isotropic speed of light in this particular system we have
to synchronize the clocks according to Einstein-synchro-
nization with a synchronization parameter of ε = 1/2 in
every direction of space. For all other inertial frames I ′
we have generally the same freedom to choose a value for
the synchronization parameter. Thus we have an inﬁnite

5

number of combinations for the synchronization param-
eters. We can randomly select a particular combination,
or we can introduce a further condition or deﬁne a prop-
erty of space, which determines a particular combination.
We will denote a particular combination of synchroniza-
tion parameters as a synchronization scheme. A syn-
chronization scheme yields a particular selection of syn-
chronization parameters applicable to all involved refer-
ence systems. From all possible combinations or schemes,
there are two of special interest:

1. The ﬁrst scheme, proposed by Albert Einstein, ap-
plies Einstein-synchronization on every inertial sys-
tems.

2. The second scheme employs medium-synchroniza-
tion with a synchronization parameter depending
on velocity v of the moving inertial system with
respect to the stationary system as well as on angle
χ of the direction of synchronization with respect
to the velocity vector v (see Fig. 3).

The two schemes diﬀer with respect to a medium.
Theory of special relativity ignores a medium and deals
without one, because general isotropy of speed of light
doesn’t lead to reasonable properties for a realistic me-
dium. Medium-synchronization accepts explicitly a real-
istic medium by adaptation the synchronization param-
eter ε.

It may seem that medium-synchronization violates the
principle of relativity, but there is always given the pos-
sibility to select any particular inertial system and make
it to the system at rest. Thus the principle of relativity
is fulﬁlled. There is no need to declare all inertial sys-
tems to systems at rest at the same time, when obviously
moving systems are observable. We can do this, and we
are allowed to do this, but in this case we shouldn’t won-
der about paradox results, which are actually no para-
doxa, they are real consequencies of what we do:—An
observer in an Einstein-synchronized system comparing
his measuring-rod with measuring-rods of other inertial
systems, which are moving with respect to him will al-
ways ﬁnd his measuring-rod to be the longest. At the
same time another observer in a moving system with re-
spect to the ﬁrst system but also Einstein-synchronized
will ﬁnd his measuring-rod to be the longest of all. This
is no contradiction and no paradox but an experimental
measurable fact, which is only due to the synchronization
scheme of clocks leading to the relativ simultaneity of
events such as the events of measuring the end-positions
of a moving rod.—A clock of a ﬁrst inertial system meets
a clock of a second inertial system only once, so there
is no possibility given to ﬁnd out, which one of the two
clocks is running faster. Using light signals to achieve
a second event for comparing the time readings of the
two clocks yields a result depending on the synchroniza-
tion scheme applied to the systems. When both systems
are Einstein-synchronized everyone of the two clocks can
claim to run faster than the other. This seems to be

paradox but it is actually measurable and therefore no
contradiction. We do not need to endeavour general rel-
ativity to solve the paradoxa of special relativity, the re-
sults have to be taken as they are.

1. Einstein-synchronization

When we assume isotropy of speed of light, i.e., the
same magnitude for speed of light in both directions
(from A to B as well as from B to A) we have to apply
a synchronization parameter ε with the special value of
1/2. This method of synchronization is called Einstein-
synchronization, Eq. (16).

ε =

1
2

(16)

When we speak of a Einstein-synchronized inertial sys-
tem we have applied condition (16) not only on one par-
ticular direction but on every direction where clocks have
to be synchronized in that system.

2. Medium-synchronization

With medium-synchronization we assign properties to
space similar to those of a realistic medium. That is,
isotropy of speed of light we ﬁnd only in the system
at rest.
In all other moving inertial systems we have
anisotropy according to the moving state with respect
to the system at rest. The following example shall ex-
plain that. A metal-rod with homogenious structure has
isotropic speed of sound only in a frame of reference,
where the rod is at rest. When using a frame of reference
drifting along the axis of the rod at velocity v the speed
of sound in the rod will be no more isotropic, but the rod
will be still homogeniuous, nothing changed the property
of the rod. That means, when we assume a homogenious
structure for a given body or for space, isotropy of all
properties cannot be concluded for all inertial systems of
reference. This holds also for speed of light and electro-
magnetic waves in empty space.

Our job is to ﬁnd an instruction for synchronization the
clocks in moving systems. For that purpose we use the
anisotropy of speed of light in the moving system, which
is already measurable in the Einstein-synchronized sta-
tionary system. In the moving system we have to adjust
the clocks in such a manner, that the same anisotropy is
yielded when measuring the speed of light in the moving
system. We are enforced to this assumption because of
the reasonable fact, that the relation of the time elapsed
for a light pulse traveling along a given distance to the
time elapsed traveling in the opposite direction should
be always the same, no matter from which inertial sys-
tem the time diﬀerences have been measured. This result
could be conﬁrmed speciﬁcally when additional signals of
inﬁnite speed were available.

K0 und K ′ are common. The x-, y- und z-axis of both co-
ordinate systems are parallel to each other (x||x′), (y||y′),
(z||z′). A light ray emitted at time tA′(1) at end A′ arrives
at time tB′(2) at end B′ after elapsed time th according

Eq. (19) gives the synchronization parameter for the
moving system K ′ measured in the stationary system
K0. Now we use measuring-rods of the moving system
K ′, where the moving rod is at rest. The velocity v′ of
the rod is zero, and let the angle of the rod with respect
to the x′-axis be χ′, then we denote the parameter for
synchronization the clock at B′ with respect to the clock
at A′ with ε′(0, χ′). Thus we get the instruction (20) for
synchronization of the clocks at A′ and B′ in the system
K ′:

According to this instruction the clocks in all moving
systems can be synchronized. For an angle of χ = 0
Eq. (19) gets the simple form (21).

For an angle of χ = π/2 the cosine of χ equals zero and
the synchronization parameter has the constant value of
ε = 1/2 (22), independent of velocity v.

the rod represents the xr-axis of the system Kr and is
aligned with the x-axis of our stationary system K0. We
assume the rod beeing at rest in the system K0, and the
clocks TA and TB having arbitrary zero position settings
[Fig. 4(a)]. The position of the rod in the system K0
at K0-time t0 is depicted by line R and the correspond-
ing Kr-time readings are given by the clocks beyond the
line. The line R′ shows the ’now’-position of the rod in
the system K0 at Kr-time tr0.—By means of Einstein-
synchronization the clocks TA and TB with respect to
the clock at the origin of the system at rest K0 the rod
becomes part of the system K0 indicated by the same
’now’-position of lines R and R′ [Fig. 4(b)].—On acceler-
ation the rod keeps in fact simultaneity with system K0
but moves in the x-direction at velocity v [Fig. 4(c)].—
Applying Einstein-synchronization again to the clocks TA
and TB with respect to the clock at the origin of the mov-
ing system K ′, the ’now’ of the rod in this new moving
system of reference K ′ is diﬀerent from the ’now’ of the
system at rest K0 [Fig. 4(d)], thus aﬀecting the length
of the same rod at rest when compared with the moving
rod in the system K ′.

With medium-synchronization we are now able to de-
velope the equations for transformation of the coordi-
nates from our stationary system K0 into the moving
system K ′. x, y, z, and t are the position and time co-
ordinates of the frame at rest K0, whereas x′, y′, z′, and
t′ are the position and time coordinates of the moving
frame K ′. The axes are assumed to be parallel (x||x′),
(y||y′), (z||z) and the origin O′ of the moving frame drifts
at constant velocity v in the x-direction measured in the
frame at rest. In the stationary system K0 speed of light
has magnitude c0 in every direction. When the rod with
the two clocks at A′ and B′ is aligned with the x′-axis
the angle χ′ = 0 and Eq. (21) applies:

IV. MEDIUM-TRANSFORMATION

The synchronization parameter calculated by Eq. (19)
is always within the limits 0 and 1 for any value of angle
χ and drift velocity v, as long as the drift velocity is less
than speed of light c0. Therefore medium-synchroniza-
tion generally complies with observable phenomena.

E. Eﬀect of synchronization on the ’now’-position

What means synchronization, what happens at syn-
chronization? Synchronization changes the zero position
settings of the clocks in a system, so we have to look for
a property, which is directly aﬀected by the zero position
settings in order to characterize the eﬀect of synchro-
nization. Such a property is the ’now’ of a system, the
state of common time. Figure 4 is showing a rod of ar-
bitrary length equipped with two equally clocks TA and
TB on both ends A and B, respectively, thus represent-
ing its own system of reference Kr (xr, tr). The axis of

from the x-, y-, and z-coordinate of the frame at rest.
Again, regarding the propagation of light signals along

nate transformation compatible with a medium, called
medium-transformation, Eqs. (31–35).

In literature this transformation is called a kind of a
general Galilei transformation [2, p. 137], because it con-
serves simultaneity. The derivation of medium-transfor-
mation is similar to that given in [1], except the transfor-
mation of the x-coordinate has to be performed in both
directions, the positive and the negative direction. Com-
paring both results yields relation (36) between speed of
light c′

A. Properties of medium-transformation

Medium-transformation has the same properties as
Lorentz-transformation regarding lenght contraction and
time dilation. However, other properties have remark-
able diﬀerences, i.e., theorem of velocity summation and
simultaneity.

1. Simultaneity

Eq. (31) shows no dependence of time on any coordi-
nate of space. Thus two events occuring simultaneously
in the system at rest on diﬀerent positions are the same
simultaneous in all other frames of reference. This is a
major diﬀerence to Lorentz-transformation.

garding a particular direction ri any speed v(ri) in this
direction cannot be greater than speed of light cp (ri) in
this direction.

We know exactly when to apply Lorentz-transforma-
tion or medium transformation if we have two inertial
systems I1 and I2. It depends on the method of synchro-
nization applied to the systems. But, what is the case,
when an inertial system changes its moving state with
respect to others by an acceleration interval? What kind
of synchronization do we ﬁnd after that acceleration in-
terval? A simple experiment discussed below will give an
answer.

Consider a rod of length l with two clocks TA and TB
of equal properties mounted on both ends and the rod
resting in the frame of reference (Fig. 5). The location of
clock TA is the origin of the coordinate system and the
axis of the rod is aligned with the x-axis. The location
of clock TB has the coordinates (l, 0, 0). The clocks are
synchronized according to Einstein-synchronization, thus
behaving like a system at rest.

At time tA = tB = 0 we accelerate the rod in the
positive x-direction to velocity v and ask for the time the
two clocks TA and TB should have to show immediately
after the acceleration interval ta.

immediately after the acceleration interval ta. Thus
clock TB has a time lack of lv/c2
0 with respect to clock
TA. λ is a factor, which allows for compensation the non-
constant velocity v within the acceleration interval ta,
because the γ-factor depends on velocity v. The maxi-
mum value for λ is γ, the minimum value is unity, cond.
(43) (see Fig. 6).

FIG. 6: Expected range of correction factor λ. When the
whole change in velocity occures instantaneous at time t0,
then λ will be unity. When the whole change occures at time
tA, then λ equals γ. However, ﬁnite acceleration leads to a
change in velocity merely as depicted by the bold, solid line,
so we expect the correction factor λ within the limits 1 and
γ.

two clocks are exposed. According to general relativity a
clock in a gravitation ﬁeld is running slower than a clock
in a space free of gravitation. Thus the correction factor
λ may be less than unity but cannot be greater than γ.
Since we are looking only at the maximum value of λ,
the eﬀect of acceleration on the clocks doesn’t aﬀect our
considerations.

Even if we take the maximum value for λ, for a given
acceleration interval ta setting Eq. (42) to zero we can
always ﬁnd a minimum length lm so that after the ac-
celeration interval clock TB has to show a time of zero.
If we make length l greater than lm clock TB has to run
backwards, which is not reasonable. The other point is,
clock TB is running diﬀerently with respect to clock TA.
Therefore we suppose the Lorentz-transformation does
not apply when describing the state of the moving sys-
tem of clocks after the acceleration interval.

1. Description according to medium-transformation

time has no space dependence. After the acceleration

C. Transformation according to
Einstein-synchronization

What is to do to put the moving system of clocks
into a state, which is correctly described by the Lorentz-
transformation? The two clocks TA and TB have to be
Einstein-synchronized once again by exchanging light sig-
nals. Is there a transformation given, which describes this
Einstein-synchronization correctly? If we suppose the
moving system of clocks is in the state corresponding to
medium-transformation, then the way from the medium-
transformed system K ′
M into the Lorentz-transformed
system K ′

L is the following:

1. Inverse medium-transformation from the moving
M into the coordinate system

coordinate system K ′
at rest K0

2. Lorentz-transformation of the coordinate system at
rest K0 into the moving coordinate system K ′
L

The inverse medium-transformation is given by the
Eqs. (45–48). Subscript ’M ’ indicates variables of the
medium-transformed system to distinguish from vari-
ables of the Lorentz-transformed system indicated by
subscript ’L’.

We plug in Eqs. (45–48) into Lorentz-transformation and
obtain Eqs. (49–52), which we call Einstein-synchroniza-
tion as well.

D. Properties of Einstein-synchronization

Einstein-synchronization leaves the position coordi-
nates constant whereas the time coordinate gets the space
dependence known from Lorentz-transformation.

The factor λ has the same meaning as in Eq. (41).
There is no deviation between the time of clock TA and
the time of clock TB, which is much more reasonable
than the result with Lorentz-transformation. We ﬁnd the
moving system of clocks after the acceleration interval in
a synchronization state according to medium-transforma-
tion.

E. Relation between Lorentz-transformation,
medium-transformation and
Einstein-synchronization

Lorentz-transformation can be taken as the product of
two seperate transformations, the medium-transforma-
tion as the ﬁrst part followed by Einstein-synchroniza-
tion (Fig. 7), which corresponds actually to observable

E′ and B′ are the vectors of the electric and mag-
netic ﬁeld in the moving system. There is no doubt,
the medium-transformation alters the form of the orig-
inal Maxwell equations. But there is no need at all for
the equations to be left unchanged with transformation
as long as the transformed equations describe observ-
ables in a right manner. In order to show, that Maxwell
equations for the moving frame (55) and (56) have simi-
lar properties as Maxwell equations for the frame at rest
(53) and (54) we derive the wave equation for both cases.

A. Wave equation and wave function for the frame
at rest

FIG. 7: Relation between Lorentz-transformation (LT),
medium-transformation (MT) and Einstein-synchronization
(ES). Lorentz-transformation can be regarded as the product
of medium-transformation and Einstein-synchronization.

From Eqs. (53) and (54) we can derive the wave Eq. (57)

for the frame at rest

0∆E − ¨E = c2

(57)

phenomena, because when a system changes its state of
movement we have always ﬁrst to wait for the system to
become inertial again and then we can apply Einstein-
synchronization on the clocks.

VI. MAXWELL EQUATIONS

Now, we have to prove the properties of medium-trans-
formation regarding the compliance with observable phe-
nomena by applying it on Maxwell equations. For con-
venience we use the homogenious version of the displace-
ment current law (53), i.e., for empty space, and the in-
duction law (54). First we apply medium-transformation
on both equations and then we derive the wave equation,
because the properties of the tranformed Maxwell equa-
tions are demonstrated more easily by the wave equa-
tion. We have omitted the other two ’divergence’ laws,
because they are not neccessary for our purpose. Dots
on the symbols are denoting time derivatives.

tion of Eq. (53) is given in appendix A.

On the left-hand side the vector of the electric ﬁeld
E occures seperately, whereas on the right-hand side it
occures within the scalar product (∇E). One possible
solution of this diﬀerential equation is that both sides,
the left-hand side as well as the right-hand side, have to
be zero at the same time when we plug in a wave function.
The wave function (58) for a plane electromagnetic wave
solves the left-hand part of Eq. (57).

E(r, t) = E0 sin (ω0t − kr)

(58)

E0 is the amplitude and the direction of the electric
ﬁeld, ω0 the angular frequency, k is the wave vector, and
r the vector to a point of space in the frame at rest.
When setting the left-hand side of the wave Eq. (57) to
zero, generally the right-hand side is swept under the rug
by the argument that the divergence of the electric ﬁeld
in vacuum is zero due to the absence of charges. But this
argument does no more apply in our case, because we
used almost the homogenious version of Maxwell equa-
tions implying the absence of charges. We cannot simply
cancel the right-hand side of our wave equation, the wave
function has to solve both the left-hand side as well as the
right-hand side of the wave equation. And in fact, the
right-hand side gives information on the wave function
to be found as will be shown below. The evidence for
doing so becomes quite clear when we are dealing with
the wave equation for the moving system.

As mentioned above, setting both sides of the wave
Eq. (57) to zero is one particular solution, other solutions
are possible as well with wave functions making both
sides of the wave equation equal but not zero, however,
this kind of solutions will not be discussed here.

When we set the right-hand side of Eq. (57) to zero,
0∇, and plug in the wave function from

cancel the term c2
Eq. (58), we obtain condition (59)

(∇E(r, t)) = 0

(59)

which ﬁnally leads to condition (60)

(kE0) = 0

(60)

Since the wave vector k in the frame at rest always
has the same direction as the propagation vector cp (see
Fig. 8), condition (60) can be written as

(cpE0) = 0

(61)

meaning that the ﬁeld vector E0 has to be perpendic-
ular to the propagation vector cp. The same holds for
the ﬁeld vector B0. This property of the wave equation
(57) we will keep in mind for comparison with the cor-
responding property (79) of the wave equation for the
moving frame (62).

B. Wave equation and wave function for a moving
frame

From Eqs. (55) and (56) we derive the wave Eq. (62)

for a real moving frame (see appendix B).

the other three terms when we plug in a wave function.

and angle ϕ is given by the aberra-
tion law (69). Tic marks on the axes indicate the length scale
′
used. The length scale of the x
-axis is contracted, so the wave
count per length unit in the moving system K ′(x′, y′) is less
than the wave count in the stationary system K0(x, y), thus
the wave vector k′
is shifted slightly backwards towards the
negative x-direction with respect to the wave vector k, but
is not aﬀected by the driftvector v in opposite to the propa-
gation vector cp. The propagation wave vector k′
p represents
the wave count per unit length in the direction of propagation
in the moving frame K

.

To achieve the propagation vector c′

p for the moving
frame of reference, we have to apply theorem of velocity
addition Eqs. (37–39) to the components of the propaga-
tion vector cp given by Eq. (66)

cp = c0

Now, what about the right-hand part of Eq. (62)? Ac-

observable phenomena as well as with Eq. (61) for the
frame at rest.

C. Application of Einstein-synchronization

We will demonstrate the eﬀect of Einstein-synchroniza-
tion on a system complying with medium-transformation
by the example of the wave Eq. (63). The driftvector v is
assumed to have only one component in the x-direction,
Eq. (80)

v



wave equation Einstein-synchronization turns Maxwell
Eqs. (55) and (56) for a moving frame of reference into
the form (53) and (54) for a frame at rest.

VII. CONCLUSION

The example of the wave equation showed that medium-
transformation leads to reasonable results, so we can say,
there is a way out of the dilemma, the possibility is given
to consider a realistic medium complying with observ-
If we take a particular inertial sys-
able phenomena.
tem and consider the diﬀerence of coordinate systems
between Einstein-synchronization and medium-synchro-
nization, we ﬁnd identical position coordinates, only the
zero position settings of the clocks are diﬀerently. The
structure of (empty) space cannot depend on the zero po-
sition settings of our clocks. Thus, when with medium-
transformation the structure of space can be given by the
model of a realistic medium, the same structure should

be compliant with Lorentz-transformation and with the-
ory of special relativity. That means, a medium is not in
contradiction with theory of special relativity, although
principle of constant speed of light demands isotropy of
speed of light in every inertial system, because we have
to remember that this general isotropy is manipulated, is
forced by the synchronization scheme and not a naturally
given phenomenon.

The disadvantage of medium-transformation is that in
any moving system of reference we have always to know
the moving state with respect to the system at rest K0,
i.e., we have to know the velocity vector v. Another
disadvantage is the transformed equations become more
complex. However, the advantage of medium-transfor-
mation is that a medium can be treated as an absolutely
normal medium with properties similar to real matter.
Another advantage is, there are no paradoxa at all. And
the paradoxa of theory of special relativity are actually
no paradoxa but observable facts only due to the syn-
chronization scheme for the clocks.

Medium-transformation is an alternative to Lorentz-
transformation, but not an exclusive. Both apply and
both are valuable, they are not in contradiction to each
other. Of course, Lorentz-transformation will remain
the more commonly used transformation, because it is
a symmetrical transformation and more convenient to
use. Medium-transformation becomes important when
the properties of the medium are to be considered.

Lorentz-transformation as well as medium-transforma-
tion, both yield the same phenomena regarding length
contraction and time dilation, although their axioms are
rather diﬀerent. In other words, neither the principle of
constant speed of light nor the concept of a medium can
be responsible for relativistic phenomena. There must
be a presupposition common to both transformations,
and indeed, when looking more closer on the constituting
conditions one identiﬁes Eq. (6), which implies all the
relativitstic behaviour.

VIII. OUTLOOK

The medium-transformation yields the presupposition
to consider a realistic medium, but this is only the very
ﬁrst step to a following theory of a medium, which is
compared with this contribution an enormously big task.
Before starting this project, we will pay attention on ac-
companing subjects in order to check for other presuppo-
sitions or to achieve useful information for a theory of a
medium. For example, medium-transformation doesn’t
take into account gravity. From this point of view it
is on the same level as theory of special relativity. Gen-
eral relativity is a powerful instrument when dealing with
gravity, but Riemannian spacetime is rigidly Lorentz-
invariant. Medium-transformation violates Lorentz-in-
variance, thus we have to look for a spacetime compati-
ble with medium-transformation, but leading to equiva-
lent results compared with general relativity (like length

contraction and time dilation of medium-transformation
compared with theory of special relativity). Secondly we
will test a simple model of photons explaining the prop-
erties of dispersion and the process of reﬂection. The
model has to describe the forces arising from temporary
dipole charges of the photons when penetrating electric
ﬁelds with an inhomogenious gradient. The results of
this model will give information on the proposed model
of a particle regarding the stability due to the charge of
the particle (see app. D). Only when all neccessary con-
ditions seem to be fulﬁlled, it will be reasonable to start
the whole project, the development of medium theory.

1 − v2/c2
and subtract and add the term

We transform the diﬀerential operators of the ﬁrst two
terms back into the coordinate system at rest K0, add
the term ∂Ex/∂x′, also multiplied by the ratio v/c2
0, and
subtract it again at the same place, in order the changes
to cancel. We extract the ratio v/c2

formed into the moving System K ′, equals the second
term on the right-hand side of the equation, both terms
cancel each other, thus we obtain the following equation
for the x′-component of the ﬁrst Maxwell equation.

This is the wave equation of the electric ﬁeld vector E′
for a moving frame of reference derived from Maxwell
Eqs. (55) and (56). – A similar procedure yields the
wave equation of the magnetic ﬁeld vector B′, which is
identical to Eq. (62) except that E’s are substituted by
B’s.

APPENDIX C: TRANSPORT OF CLOCKS AT
REAL SPEED

When using a moving clock to synchronize the clocks
in an inertial system, the moving clock has to be trans-
ported inﬁnitely slowly. At real speed, however, the mov-
ing clock no longer transports Lorentz-time. We will
show this diﬀerence by an experiment with two clocks
moving at equal speed but in opposite direction with re-
spect to a moving inertial system K ′ (x′, t′). The moving
system K ′ drifts at velocity v in the positive x-direction
with respect to the system at rest K0 (x, t), and is repre-
sented by a rod of length 2 l0 with Einstein-synchronized
clocks TA and TC on both ends A′ and C′, thus behav-
ing like a system at rest (see Fig. 9). The axis of the
rod is aligned with the x′-axis of system K ′ as well as
with the x-axis of system K0 (x||x′). Location B′ is ex-
actly in the middle of the rod. – At K0-time t0 two light
pulses LA and LB are issued from location B′ spread-
ing in the −x- and +x-direction, respectively. The light
pulses have speed c0 measured in the stationary system
K0. – At time tD the light pulse LA arrives at location
A′ and starts clock TA moving at speed +w towards lo-
cation B′. This event is denoted by D. – In the opposite
direction at time tE the light pulse LB arrives at loca-
tion C′ and starts clock TC moving towards location B′
at speed −w. This event is denoted by E. – At time
tF both clocks TA and TC meet simultaneously in the
middle of the rod at event F .

The velocities +w and −w have been measured with
clocks and measuring rods of the moving system K ′. The
clocks TA and TC show time zero at the instance when
they start moving, thus showing directly elapsed time of
movement when arriving at location B′. The principle of
relativity demands equal elapsed times of the clocks TA

and TC when arriving in the middle of the rod at event F ,
but when we calculate this problem from the stationary
system K0, even with the tools from theory of special rela-
tivity, we encounter a diﬀerence in elapsed times, indeed,
only a very small, but a nonvanishing diﬀerence. The
velocities +w and −w hold good for the moving system
K ′, in order to get the corresponding velocities uh and
ur for the system at rest K0 we have to apply theorem of
velocity composition from theory of special relativity, be-
cause of the previously Einstein-synchronized clocks TA
and TC. They represent Lorentz-time, not medium-time.
We used the vehicle with the light pulses in order to get
a simple means for calculation the start events D and E
without the need for transformation the whole problem
into the moving frame. Furthermore, the light pulse en-
sures simultaneity of the events D and E regarded from
the moving system K ′. In fact, an observer at location B′
will ﬁnd the clocks starting simultaneously and arriving
simultaneously.

First we have to calculate the time coordinates tD,
tE, and tF . The light pulses start at event B when the
corresponding time coordinate t0 equals zero, Eq. (C1).

t0 = 0

(C1)

The distance of events A and C is equal to the length
of the rod measured in the system at rest K0, thus the
distances of events A and B as well as of events B and
C are given by Eq. (C2).

When looking for a possibility to determine the exis-
tance of ‘the medium’, the experiment with two moving
clocks actually could be one, but regarding the demands
on resolution of time measurement, it is merely a theo-
retical one as is shown by the result calculated from the
following ﬁgures: assuming a drift velocity v of 600 km/s
for our galaxy and a transport speed w for the clocks
of 1200 km/h over a distance l0 of 10 km we have to
expect a time diﬀerence ∆t′ in the order of 3 ·10−13 s
at a total transport time of 30 s. Besides the enormous
challenge for realization of the experimental setup the
main problem arises from the requirements on time mea-
surement. We need to have an accuracy for the clocks
better than 10−15 in order to get reasonable quantities
for the time diﬀerence. As far as we know, this accu-
racy is quite beyond the accuracy of currently available
clocks, meaning that the deviation of the moving time
from Lorentz-time isn’t yet measurable. There are ac-
tivites on developing optically controlled clocks aiming
on an accuracy of 10−18, so we may expect a possibility
is there a
in future to get an answer on the question:
medium or not?

APPENDIX D: REMARKS ON THE MEDIUM

Primarily we had no intention to give any statement
on a proposed medium, because there is no theory of a
medium at all, only a few ideas exist, therefore any state-
ment is rather speculative. And here, we don’t even ask
for the reason to introduce a medium, we ask only for the
presupposition. Along with the discussions accompaning
the formation of this contribution the questions often oc-
curred: What is the medium alike? What is the nature
of this medium? – Finally, we felt it is indicated at least

19

to characterize brieﬂy our current ideas to a model of the
medium, however, keeping in mind these are only ideas,
which are subject to change whenever it is required by
future development.

Our medium has an elastic structure with a homoge-
nious mass density when no distortion occures. The elas-
tic properties are characterized by a kind of a stress ten-
sor with components independent of the position when no
distortion is present. The structure is able to carry repul-
sive forces, attractive forces, as well as torsional forces,
and other kinds of elastic forces. Thus there are many
kinds of elastic waves possible, given by the mass den-
sity and the stress tensor. The energy density of these
elastic waves obeys 1/r2-law. Light quanta are a special
kind of waves, maybe a kind of a torsional wave, occur-
ring as wave packets, which don’t spread like a sphere
but along a straight line, thus conserving the amplitude
and the energy of the packets (at least on a small scale).
Particles are frozen packets of that torsional waves get-
ting stable by a special kind of a torsion state of the
surrounding medium, which is equivalent to the charge
of the particle [5]. The frozen wave packets as well as
the free running light quanta cause a distortion of mass
density in such a manner, that within the space occupied
by the wave packet the mass density is enhanced, and
the mass density in the vicinity outside the wave packet
is decreased. The components of the stress tensor are
also altered, and the deviation of these components from
the equilibrium value at no distortion as well as the de-
viation of the mass density decay according to 1/r2-law
thus forming the gravitational ﬁeld of a particle or of a
light quantum. The particle or the frozen wave packet,
respectively, isn’t ﬁxed at a certain position within the
medium, but can be moved througout the medium at any
speed, provided this speed is less than the speed of the
free running wave packets, i.e., the speed of light c0.

An ensemble of particles forms a body. The medium
drifts through moving particles and through moving bod-
ies without remarkable friction, regardless to the number
of particles comprising that body. This holds good for
small bodies as well as for very large bodies such as the
earth and even for the sun. A body represents a system
of reference, and the speed of light is only isotropic in
that system when the drift velocity of this body is zero
with respect to the medium. When the drift velocity is
diﬀerent from zero, we have anisotropy of speed of light.
This is a fundamental property of our proposed medium,
which we have to take into account when looking for a
transformation of coordinates from a system at rest into
a moving system. Furthermore our model makes clear
that speed of light, measured in a particular system of
reference, is independent from the velocity of the emitter.
Of course, the measured magnitude surely depends on
the moving state of this system, say, the synchronization
method applied to the clocks of the system of reference.

Abstract

The spin-statistics connection is proved using the methods of elementary quantum mechanics.

The eﬀect of exchange and space inversion operators on two-particle states is reviewed. The

connection follows directly from successive application of these operations to the wave function for

two identical particles in an s-state, evaluated at positions

x, but at equal time.

INTRODUCTION

The connection between spin and statistics, ﬁrst conjectured by Pauli, and subsquently

proved by Pauli,1 Burgoyne,2 and L¨uders and Zumino,3 has an understandable appeal to

students of physics as an example of a phenomenon arising from quantum mechanics and

relativity that has palpable consequences in the realm of everyday experience.4,5,6 This pa-

per presents a demonstration of the spin-statistics connection by an elementary argument

involving symmetry of two-particle wave functions under the combined operations of ex-

change and parity.7,8 It is intended to be accessible to ﬁnal-year undergraduate students

of quantum mechanics, who will have had exposure to simple angular momentum theory,

the Pauli principle, and the concept of parity. The argument makes no explicit appeal to

special relativity, although underlying assumptions traceable to Poincar´e symmetry may be

discerned in what follows.

The proof concerns two-particle states constructed from noninteracting single-particle

wave functions possessing deﬁnite symmetry under rotations and parity. It assumes particles

obey either Bose or Fermi statistics, that is, that multiparticle wave functions are respectively

symmetric, or antisymmetric, under exchange of particle identity.9

In the following, a (single-particle) state may be described by the ket vector

or by the

II. BACKGROUND

A. Quantum states of higher spin

We start by reciting results from the theory of angular momentum in quantum mechanics

that ﬁnd use in the following. The total angular momentum operators Ji give rise to in-

ﬁnitesimal rotations of a state about the xi axes.10 Eigenstates of total angular momentum
~j can take on a range of values for the z-projection of angular momentum,11

complished with a unitary transformation whose matrix elements are Clebsch-Gordan co-

eﬃcients.13 The Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient coupling two states with total and magnetic

angular momentum quantum numbers (ja, ma) and (jb, mb), respectively, to a state with

III. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SPIN AND STATISTICS

The connection is proved with the aid of a wave function that gives the amplitude for the

simultaneous location of one particle at spacetime location (x, t) and another at location

The singlet wave function appearing in Eq. (34) is nonvanishing if the individual wave

functions from which it is constructed are themselves nonvanishing. A proof of this assertion

appears in the Appendix. If we can assume the matrix element on both sides of Eq. (34)

does not vanish, we immediately have

makes clear its connection with a common description of the spin-statistics connection. The

operator that rotates a state of deﬁnite angular momentum about a speciﬁed axis by a given

angle is derived in Vol. III, chapter 18 of Ref. 10. In particular, the operator that rotates a

state around the y axis by an angle π is

It follows immediately that the result of rotating by an angle of 2π about the y axis is

Equation (36) is thus equivalent to an oft-stated formulation of the connection: The eﬀect

of exchanging the position of two identical particles (LHS) is equivalent to the rotation of

one of them by an angle of 2π around a suitable axis (RHS).

IV. DISCUSSION

The proof just given relies almost entirely on elementary quantum mechanics. Apart

from the material appearing in the appendix, it depends on nothing that cannot readily

be obtained (or at a minimum, motivated) starting from pertinant discussions in the Feyn-

man Lectures. In addition, the proof makes no overtly relativistic assumptions. This lack

is perhaps more apparent than real, however. At certain points the argument rests upon

assumptions that ﬂow in a natural and unforced way from requirements of relativistic sym-

metry, but which arguably enter a nonrelativistic exposition in neither fashion.

An instance is the symmetry of the wave function in Eq. (24), which is a disguised

statement of an equal-time commutation relation. Exhibiting the dependence upon t, Eq.

(24) becomes

The statement that a relation holds between two particles separated by nonzero distance

at equal time has no unambiguous meaning under admissable changes of coordinates.21

Equation (40), however, is an invariant statement under arbitrary Lorentz transformations.

In proofs of the spin-statistics relation, the exchange symmetry appearing in Eq. (24) is

usually stipulated subject to Eq. (40). One says that wave functions of identical particles

commute or anticommute outside the light cone.22

Moreover, it was assumed that wave functions exist with certain simple, conjoined sym-

metries with respect to the operations of parity and rotation. The assumed symmetries

of wave functions are those of an irreducible representation of the Poincar´e group. Thus,

elements of the present demonstration that enter a nonrelativistic version of the proof as

distinct hypotheses all follow from the single requirement of Poincar´e invariance in an ex-

plicitly relativistic treatment. Granted this observation, the nonrelativistic view does not

appear to be the parsimonious one, whatever pedagogical advantages result from discussing

the spin-statistics connection in largely nonrelativistic terms.

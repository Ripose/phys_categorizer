Abstract

Two diﬀerent strategies of the relativistic quantum theory construction
are considered and evaluated. The ﬁrst strategy is the conventional strat-
egy, based on application of the quantum mechanics technique to relativistic
systems. This approach cannot solve the problem of pair production. The
apparent success of QFT at solution of this problem is conditioned by the
inconsistency of QFT, when the commutation relations are incompatible with
the dynamic equations. (The inconsistent theory ”can solve” practically any
problem, including the problem of pair production). The second strategy is
based on application of fundamental principles of classical dynamics and those
of statistical description to relativistic dynamic systems. It seems to be more
reliable, because this strategy does not use quantum principles, and the main
problem of QFT (join of nonrelativistic quantum principles with the principles
of relativity) appears to be eliminated.

1 Introduction

The conventional quantum theory has been tested very well only for nonrelativistic
physical phenomena of microcosm. The quantum theory is founded on the non-
relativistic quantum principles. Application of the quantum theory to relativistic
phenomena of microcosm meets the problem of join of the nonrelativistic quantum
principles with the principles of the relativity theory. Many researchers believe that
such a join has been carried out in the relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT).
Unfortunately, it is not so, and the main diﬃculty lies in the fact that we do not

1

apply properly the relativity principles. Writing dynamic equations in the relativis-
tically covariant form, we believe that we have taken into account all demands of
the relativity theory.

Unfortunately, it is not so. The relativistic invariance of dynamic equations is
the necessary condition of true application of the relativistic principles, but it is not
suﬃcient. Besides, it is necessary to use the relativistic concept of the state of the
considered physical objects. For instance, describing a particle in the nonrelativistic
mechanics, we consider the pointlike particle in the three-dimensional space to be a
physical object, whose state is described by the particle position x and momentum
p. The world line of the particle is considered to be a history of the particle, but
not a physical object. However, in the relativistic mechanics the particle world
is considered to be a physical object (but not its history). In this case the

have many world lines coincidence of sets
of the constant C ′. In other words, the particle is not an invariant object, and it
cannot be considered as a physical object in the relativistic mechanics. In the case
of one world line we can compensate the noninvariant character of a particle by a
proper choice of the constant C ′, but at the statistical description, where we deal
with many world lines, such a compensation is impossible.

In the nonrelativistic mechanics there is the absolute simultaneity, and the set

TC : t =const is the same in all inertial coordinate systems. In this case
hyperplanes
intersections of world lines
TC form the same
set of events in all coordinate systems, and particles are invariant objects, which
may be considered as physical objects. Strictly, the world line should be considered
as a physical object also in the nonrelativistic physics, as far as the nonrelativistic
physics is a special case of the relativistic one. But, in this case a consideration of
a particle as a physical object is also possible, and this consideration is simpler and
more eﬀective, as far as the pointlike particle is a simpler object, than the world
line.

Ln with the hyperplane

The above statements are not new. For instance, V.A. Fock stressed in his book
[1], that concept of the particle state is diﬀerent in relativistic and nonrelativistic
mechanics. As a rule researchers do not object to such statements, but they do not
apply them in practice. The nonrelativistic quantum theory has been constructed
and tested in many experiments. It is a starting point for construction of the rel-
ativistic quantum theory. In this paper we try to investigate diﬀerent strategies of

2

the relativistic quantum theory construction, in order to choose the true one. How-
ever, at ﬁrst we consider interplay between the fundamental physical theory and the
truncated physical theory.

The scheme of this interplay is shown in the ﬁgure. The fundamental theory
is a logical structure. The fundamental principles of the theory are shown below.
The experimental data, which are to be explained by the theory are placed on high.
Between them there is a set of logical corollaries of the fundamental principles. It is
possible such a situation, when for some conditions one can obtain a list of logical
corollaries, placed near the experimental data. It is possible such a situation, when
some circle of experimental data and of physical phenomena may be explained and
calculated on the basis of this list of corollaries without a reference to the funda-
mental principles. In this case the list of corollaries of the fundamental principles
may be considered as an independent physical theory. Such a theory will be referred
to as the truncated theory, because it explains not all phenomena, but only a re-
stricted circle of these phenomena (for instance, only nonrelativistic phenomena).
Examples of truncated physical theories are known in the history of physics. For
instance, the thermodynamics is such a truncated theory, which is valid only for the
quasi-static thermal phenomena. The thermodynamics is an axiomatic theory. It
cannot be applied to nonstationary thermal phenomena. In this case one should use
the kinetic theory, which is a more fundamental theory, as far as it may be applied
to both quasi-static and nonstationary thermal phenomena. Besides, under some
conditions the thermodynamics can be derived from the kinetic theory as a partial
case.

The truncated theory has a set of properties, which provide its wide application.

1. The truncated theory is simpler, than the fundamental one, because a part
of logical reasonings and mathematical calculations of the fundamental theory
are used in the truncated theory in the prepared form. Besides, the truncated
theory is located near experimental data, and one does not need long logical
reasonings for application of the truncated theory.

2. The truncated theory is a list of prescriptions, and it is not a logical structure
in such extent, as the fundamental theory is a logical structure. The truncated
theory is axiomatic, it contains more axioms, than the fundamental theory, as
far as logical corollaries of the fundamental theory appear in the truncated
theory as fundamental principles (axioms).

3. Being simpler, the truncated theory appears before the fundamental theory. It
is a reason of conﬂicts between the advocates of the fundamental theory and
advocates of the truncated theory, because the last consider the truncated the-
ory to be the fundamental one. Such a situation took place, for instance, at
becoming of the statistical physics, when advocates of the axiomatic thermo-
dynamics oppugn against Gibbs and Boltzmann. Such a situation took place
at becoming of the doctrine of Copernicus-Galileo-Newton, when advocates

3

of the Ptolemaic doctrine oppugn against the doctrine of Copernicus-Galileo-
Newton. They referred that there was no necessity to introduce the Coperni-
can doctrine, as far as the Ptolemaic doctrine is simple and customary. Only
discovery of the Newtonian gravitation law and consideration of the celestial
phenomena, which cannot be described in the framework of the Ptolemaic
doctrine, terminated the contest of the two doctrines.

4. Constructing the truncated theory before the fundamental one, the trial and
error method is used usually. In other words, the truncated theory is guessed,
but not constructed by a logical way.

The main defect of the truncated theory is an impossibility of its expansion
over wider circle of physical phenomena. For instance, let the truncated theory
explain nonrelativistic physical phenomena. It means, that the basic propositions of
the truncated theory are obtained as corollaries of the fundamental principles and
of nonrelativistic character of the considered phenomena. To expand the truncated
theory on relativistic phenomena, one needs to separate, what in the principles of the
truncated theory is a corollary of fundamental principles and what is a corollary of
nonrelativistic character of the considered phenomena. A successful separation of the
two factors means essentially a perception of the theory truncation and construction
of the fundamental theory.
If the fundamental theory has been constructed, the
expansion of the theory on the relativistic phenomena is obtained by an application
of the fundamental principles to the relativistic phenomena. The obtained theory
will describe the relativistic phenomena correctly. It may be distinguished essentially
from the truncated theory, which is applicable for description of only nonrelativistic
phenomena.

The conventional nonrelativistic quantum theory is a truncated theory, which is
applicable only for description of nonrelativistic phenomena. It has formal signs of
the truncated theory (long list of axioms, simplicity, nearness to experimental data).
Truncated character of the nonrelativistic quantum theory is called in question usu-
ally by researchers working in the ﬁeld of the quantum theory. The principal problem
of the relativistic quantum theory is formulated usually as a problem of uniﬁcation
of the nonrelativistic quantum principles with the principles of the relativity theory.
Conventionally the nonrelativistic quantum theory is considered to be a funda-
mental theory. The relativistic quantum theory is tried to be constructed without
puzzling out, what in the nonrelativistic quantum theory is conditioned by the fun-
damental principles and what is conditioned by its nonrelativistic character. It is
suggested that the linearity is the principal property of the quantum theory, and it
is tried to be saved. However, the analysis shows that the linearity of the quantum
theory is some artiﬁcial circumstance [2], which simpliﬁes essentially the description
of quantum phenomena, but it does not express the essence of these phenomena.
The conventional approach to construction of the relativistic quantum theory is
shown by the dashed line in the scheme. Following this line, the construction of
the true relativistic quantum theory appears to be as diﬃcult, as a discovery of the
Newtonian gravitation law on the basis of the Ptolemaic conception, because in this

4

case only the trial and errors method can be used. Besides, even we succeeded to
construct such a theory, it will be very diﬃcult to choose the valid version of the the-
ory, because it has no logical foundation. In other words, the conventional approach
to construction of the relativistic quantum theory (invention of new hypotheses and
ﬁtting) seems to lead to blind alley, although one cannot eliminate the case that it
appears to be successful. (the trial and error method appeared to be successful at
construction of the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics).

Alternative way of construction of the relativistic theory of physical phenomena
in the microcosm is shown in ﬁgure by the solid line. It supposes a derivation of
fundamental principles and their subsequent application to the relativistic physical
phenomena. Elimination of the nonrelativistic quantum principles is characteristic
for this approach. This elimination is accompanied by elimination of the problem of
an uniﬁcation of the nonrelativistic quantum principles with the relativity principles.
Simultaneously one develops dynamic methods of the quantum system investigation,
when the quantum system is investigated simply as a dynamic system. These meth-
ods are free of application of quantum principles. They are used for investigation of
both relativistic and nonrelativistic quantum systems. A use of logical constructions
is characteristic for this approach. One does not use an invention of new hypotheses
and ﬁtting (the trial and error method).

It is assumed usually that quantum systems contain such a speciﬁc nonclassical
object as the wave function. Quantum principles is a list of prescriptions, how to
work with the wave functions. In reality the wave function is not a speciﬁc nonclassi-
cal object. The wave function is a complex hydrodynamic potential. Any ideal ﬂuid
can be described in terms the hydrodynamic potentials (Clebsch potentials [3, 4]).
In particular, it can be described in terms of the wave functions [5]. Prescriptions
for work with description in terms of wave functions follows directly from deﬁnition
of the wave function and from prescriptions for work with the dynamic systems of
hydrodynamic type. Quantum systems are such dynamic systems of hydrodynamic
type, for which the dynamic equations are linear, if they are written in terms of the

Thus, the quantum systems are not enigmatic systems, described by a speciﬁc
nonclassical object (wave function). Quantum systems are a partial case of dynamic
systems, which may and must be investigated by conventional dynamic methods,
applied in the ﬂuid dynamics. The classical principles of dynamics and those of
statistical description are fundamental principles of any dynamics and, in particular,
of the quantum mechanics, considered to be a dynamics of stochastic particles. In
other words, the nonrelativistic quantum theory is truncated theory with respect to
dynamics of the stochastic systems.

Transition to relativistic quantum mechanics means that one should apply the

5

general principles of mechanics to the statistical ensembles of stochastic particles,
whose regular component of velocity is relativistic. (Stochastic component of ve-
locity is always relativistic, even in the case, when the regular component is non-
relativistic). Such a statistical description can be carried out in terms of the wave
function. However, we cannot state previously that dynamic equations will be linear,
because in the relativistic case there is such a phenomenon as the particle produc-
tion, which is absent in the classical relativistic mechanics and in the nonrelativistic
quantum theory.

At ﬁrst sight, the direct way of transition from nonrelativistic quantum theory
to the relativistic one seems to be more attractive, because it is simpler and it does
not need a discovery of fundamental concepts. Besides, it seems to be an unique
way, if we believe that the nonrelativistic quantum theory is a fundamental theory
(but not a truncated one). Unfortunately, following the quantum principles and this
way, we come to a blind alley. This circumstance forces us to question, whether the
nonrelativistic quantum theory is a fundamental theory (but not a truncated one).
We shall refer to the path, shown by the dashed line as the direct path (direct
approach). The path, shown by the solid line will be referred to as the logical
path (logical approach). Investigation of the two approaches and of investigation
strategies connected with them is the main goal of this paper. The logical path
seems to be more adequate, but at the same time it seems to be more diﬃcult. There
are two diﬀerent methods of presentations of our investigation: (1) description of
problems of the direct path from the viewpoint of the logical one, (2) description of
those problems of the direct path which have lead to a refusal from the direct path
in favour of the logical one. In this paper we prefer to use the second version.

2 Diﬃculties of the quantum principles

application to the relativistic phenomena

The particle production is the physical phenomenon, which is characteristic only
for quantum relativistic physics. This phenomenon has no classical analog, because
it is absent in the classical relativistic physics. This phenomenon is absent in the
nonrelativistic quantum physics. At the classical description the particle production
is a turn of the world line in the time direction. According to such a conception
the particles are produced by pairs particle – antiparticle. In classical physics there
is no force ﬁeld, which could produce or annihilate such pairs.
If the world line
describes the pair production, some segment of this world line is to be spacelike. At
this segment we have

Relations (2.1) and (2.2) are incompatible. They become compatible, if there is such

Further we shall use the special term WL for the world line considered as a
physical object. The term ”WL” is the abbreviation of the term ”world line”. Along
with the term WL we shall use the term ”emlon”, which is the perusal of Russian
abbreviation ”ML”, which means world line. Investigation of the emlon, changing
its direction in the time direction and describing pair production (or annihilation),
shows [6, 7], that some segments of the emlon describe a particle, whereas another
segments describe an antiparticle. The particle and antiparticle have opposite sign
T 00dx of the particle and that of the
of the electric charge. The energy E =
dxk/dτ
antiparticle is always positive. The time components p0 = ∂L/∂ ˙x0,
of the canonical momentum pk of the particle and that of the antiparticle have
opposite sign, if the world line (WL) is considered as a single physical object (single

dynamic system). They may have the same sign and coincide with
segments of the emlon are associated with diﬀerent dynamic systems (particles and
antiparticles).

Description of the annihilation process as an evolution of two diﬀerent dynamic
systems (particle and antiparticle), which cease to exist after collision, is incompati-
ble with the conventional formalism of classical relativistic dynamics, where dynamic
systems may not disappear. However, description of this process as an evolution of
some pointlike object SWL moving along the world line in the direction of increase of
the evolution parameter τ is possible from viewpoint of the conventional formalism
of the relativistic physics. The object SWL is the abbreviation of the term ”section
of world line”. Along with the term ”SWL” we shall use also the term ”esemlon”.
It is the perusal of Russian abbreviation ”SML”, which means ”Section of the world
line”. The esemlon is the collective concept with respect to concepts of particle and
antiparticle. In the process of evolution the esemlon may change its state (particle
or antiparticle). Such an approach is compatible with the relativistic kinematics.

The investigation [6] shows that the energy E and the temporal component of
p0 are diﬀerent quantities, which may coincide, only if

p0
for the whole world line is possible also in the case, when the whole world line is
cut into segments, corresponding to particles and antiparticles, and each segment is
considered to be a single dynamic system.

It is generally assumed that the perturbation theory and the divergencies are
the main problems of QFT. In reality, it is only a vertex of iceberg. The main
problem lies in the deﬁnition of the commutation relations. We demonstrate this in
the example of the dynamic equation

(∂i∂i + m2)ϕ = λϕ∗ϕϕ

(2.4)

Here ϕ is the scalar complex ﬁeld and ϕ∗ is the Hermitian conjugate ﬁeld, λ is the
self-action constant. There are two diﬀerent schemes of the second quantization:
(1) P A-scheme, where particle and antiparticle are considered as diﬀerent physical
objects and (2) W L-scheme, where world line (WL) is considered as a physical
object. A particle and an antiparticle are two diﬀerent states of SWL (or WL). These
two schemes distinguish in the commutation relations, imposed on the operators ϕ
and ϕ∗ (see for details [8]).

In the P A-scheme there is indeﬁnite number of objects (particles and antiparti-
cles) which can be produced and annihilated. The commutators [ϕ (x) , ϕ (x′)]− and
[ϕ (x) , ϕ∗ (x′)]− vanish

[ϕ (x) , ϕ (x′)]− = 0,

[ϕ (x) , ϕ∗ (x′)] = 0,

picture.
the number of physical objects (objects of quantization) is not conserved. The
commutation relation, which are used in the P A-scheme are incompatible with the
dynamic equations. As a result the P A-scheme of the second quantization appears
to be inconsistent.

In the W L-scheme of the second quantization the number of objects of quantiza-
tion (WL) is conserved, and one can divide the whole problem into parts, containing
one WL, two WLs, three WLs etc. Each of parts may be considered and solved
independently. The statement of the problem reminds that of the nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics, where the number of particles is conserved. As a result the
whole problem may be divided into one-particle problem, two-particle problem, etc,
and each problem can be solved independently. According to such a division of the
whole problem into several simpler problems, the problem of the second quantization
in W L-scheme is reduced to several simpler problems. As a result it may be formu-
lated without a use of the perturbation theory (see for details [8]). Commutation
relations in the W L-scheme do not satisfy the condition (2.5). This circumstance is
connected with the fact that the objects of quantization (WLs) are lengthy objects.
If there is the particle production, WLs are spacelike in the sense that they may
contain points x and x′, separated by the spacelike interval. There are such dynamic

8

variables at x and at x′, lying on the same WL, for which the commutator does not
vanish, and it is a reason for violation of conditions (2.5) in the W L-scheme of quan-
tization. The commutation relations in W L-scheme are compatible with dynamic
equations. Besides, simultaneous commutation relations depend on the self-action
constant λ. The W L-scheme of the second quantization is consistent and compatible
with dynamic equations. It can be solved by means of nonperturbative methods.
However, the pair production is absent in the W L-scheme, even if the self-action
constant λ

= 0 [8].

One believes, that there is the pair production in the P A-scheme. However,
the P A-scheme is inconsistent, and the pair production is a corollary of this incon-
sistency [8]. Thus, neither P A-scheme nor W L-scheme of quantization can derive
the pair production eﬀect. It is connected with the fact, that the self-action of the
form (2.4), as well as other power interactions cannot generate pair production. To
generate the pair production, one needs interaction of special type [7].

Advocates of the P A-scheme state that in the W L-scheme the causality principle
is violated, because the conditions (2.5) are not fulﬁlled. It is not so, because the
causality principle has the form (2.5) only for pointlike objects. For lengthy objects
(spacelike world lines) the causality principle has another form [8]. The condition
(2.5) states simply that the dynamic variables of diﬀerent dynamic systems commu-
tate. But in the case of spacelike WL the points x and x′, separated by the spacelike
interval, may belong to the same dynamic system. In this case the condition (2.5)
has to be violated. But independently of whether or not the advocates of the P A-
scheme are right, the dynamic equation (2.4) does not describe the pair production,
and appearance of the pair production [9, 10, 11, 12] is a result of incompatibility
of the commutation relations with the dynamic equation.

Conventionally one considers the commutation relations as a kind of initial con-
ditions for the dynamic equations. As a result one does not see a necessity to test
the compatibility of the commutation relations with the dynamic equations. In re-
ality the analogy between the commutation relations and initial conditions is not
true. The commutation relations are additional constraints imposed on the dynamic
variables. Compatibility of additional constraints with the dynamic equations is to
be tested. Dependence of the simultaneous commutation relations on the self-action
constant λ in the W L-scheme, where such a compatibility takes place, conﬁrms the
necessity of such a test.

Thus, a direct application of the quantum mechanics formalism to a relativistic
dynamic systems leads to impossibility of the particle production description.
It
means that we should understand the essence of the quantum mechanics formalism
and revise its form in accordance with the revised understanding of the quantum
mechanics.

To show that the linearity of quantum mechanics formalism is not an essential
inherent property of the fundamental theory, we consider the Schr¨odinger particle,

shown, that all propositions of quantum mechanics can be deduced from relations of
this type. Thus, the action (3.1) describes the quantum mechanics formalism (dy-
namics), whereas the relation (3.2) forms a basis for the conventional interpretation
of the quantum mechanics.

generated by the action (3.1) is linear, and one believes that this linearity together
with the linear operators, describing all observable quantities, is the inherent prop-
erty of the quantum mechanics.

The quantum constant ¯h is supposed to describe the quantum properties in the
sense, that setting ¯h = 0 in the quantum description, we are to obtain the classical
description. However, setting ¯h = 0 in the action (3.1), we obtain no description.
All terms in the action contain ¯h, and it seems that the description by means of
the action (3.1) is quantum from the beginning to the end. In reality the principal
SS is classical, and the quantum description forms only
part of the dynamic system
a part of the general description. In other words, description in terms of the action
(3.1) is an artiﬁcial description.

To show this, we transform the wave function ψ, changing its phase

Connection between the Schr¨odinger equation and hydrodynamic description is
well known [14, 15]. But a connection between the description in terms of wave
function and the hydrodynamic description was one-way. One can transit from the
Schr¨odinger equation to the hydrodynamic equations, but one cannot transit from
hydrodynamic equations to the description in terms of the wave function, because
one needs to integrate hydrodynamic equations. Indeed, the Schr¨odinger equation
consists of two real ﬁrst order equations for the density ρ and the phase ϕ, whereas
the system of the hydrodynamic equations consists of four ﬁrst order equations for
the density ρ and for the velocity v. To obtain four hydrodynamic equations one
needs to take gradient of the equation for the phase ϕ and introduce the velocity
v = m−1∇ϕ. On the contrary, if we transit from the hydrodynamic description
to the description in terms of the wave function, we are to integrate hydrodynamic
equations. In the general case this integration was not known for a long time.

Interpretation (3.2) of the wave function ψ may be also rewritten as interpretation of
Ψb by means of transformation (3.4). In the action (3.5) only one term contains the
quantum constant ¯h, and this term is responsible for quantum eﬀects. The linearity
of the Schr¨odinger equation (3.3) may be considered as a result of the special choice
of the arbitrary constant b = ¯h.

Such a choice is justiﬁed, because it transforms the natural dynamic equation
(3.6) into the linear dynamic equation (3.3), which is very convenient for solution
and for investigation of the dynamic system
SS. However, the dynamic equation
(3.3) remains to be an artiﬁcial, because the linear property of dynamic equation
is not an essential property. It is appears as a result of the cpecial choice of the
integration constant, and the linearity may not be used for the generalization of the

4 Statistical description of relativistic particles

Any statistical description is a description of physical objects. As we have men-
tioned above, in the nonrelativistic case the physical objects are points of the three-
dimensional space. In the relativistic case the physical objects are lengthy objects:
emlons. Statistical description of nonrelativistic particles distinguishes from that
of relativistic particles in the sense, that the state density ρ at the nonrelativistic
description is deﬁned by the relation

where dN is the number of particles in the inﬁnitesimal 3-volume dV . In the rela-
tivistic case the state density jk is described by the relation

where dN is the ﬂux of world lines through the inﬁnitesimal area dSk. It follows
from the relations (4.1), (4.2) that in the nonrelativistic case one can introduce
the concept of the probability density of the state on the basis of the nonnegative

quantity ρ, whereas in the relativistic case it is impossible, because one cannot
construct the probability density on the basis of the 4-vector jk.

Statistical description is a description of the statistical ensemble, which is the
dynamic system consisting of many identical independent systems. These systems
may be dynamic or stochastic. However, the statistical ensemble is a dynamic sys-
tem in any case. It means, that there are dynamic equations, which describe the
evolution of the statistical ensemble state.
Investigation of the statistical ensem-
ble as a dynamic system admits one to investigate the mean characteristics of the
stochastic systems, constituting this ensemble. Besides, in the nonrelativistic case
the statistical ensemble is a tool for calculation of diﬀerent mean quantities and
distributions, because in this case the ensemble state may be interpreted as the
probability density of the fact, that the system state is placed at some given point
of the phase space.

The statistical ensemble is used usually in the statistical physics, where the
statistical description of the deterministic nonrelativistic systems is produced. The
principal property of the statistical ensemble (to be a dynamic system) is perceived
as some triviality, and the statistical ensemble is considered usually as a tool for
calculation of mean values of diﬀerent functions of the state. When one tries to apply
this conception of the statistical ensemble to description of relativistic stochastic
particles, it is quite natural that one fails, because the probabilistic conception
of the statistical ensemble (statistical ensemble as a tool for calculation of mean
values) cannot be applied here. The problem of construction of the dynamic system
(statistical ensemble) from stochastic systems is not stated in the statistical physics.
We display in the example of free nonrelativistic particles, how the statistical
ensemble is constructed without a reference to the probability theory. The action

is deﬁned in the coordinate space of x. Note that the transition from the statistical
ensemble (4.4) to the statistical ensemble (4.5) is purely dynamic. The concept of
probability is not used. The character of stochasticity is determined by the form of
two last terms in the action (4.5). For instance, if we replace ∇vdf in (4.5) by some
function f (∇vdf ), we obtain another type of stochasticity, which does not coincide
with the quantum stochasticity.

were x = x (t) , udf = udf (t, x). However, the action (4.6) has only a symbolic
sense, as far as the operator ∇ is deﬁned in some vicinity of the point x, but not
at the point x itself. It means, that the action (4.6) does not determine dynamic
Sst, and the particle appears to be stochastic, although
equations for the particle
dynamic equations exist for the statistical ensemble of such particles. They are
determined by the action (4.5). Thus, the particles described by the action (4.5) are
stochastic, because there are no dynamic equations for a single particle. In the case,
when the quantum constant ¯h = 0, the actions (4.6) and (4.3) coincide, because in
this case it follows from (4.6), that udf = 0.

By means of the proper change of variables these equations can be reduced to the
Schr¨odinger equation [5].

However, there is a serious mathematical problem here. The fact is that the
hydrodynamic equations are to be integrated, in order they can be described in
terms of the wave function. The fact, that the Schr¨odinger equation can be written
in the hydrodynamic form, is well known [14, 15]. However, the inverse transition
from the hydrodynamic equations to the wave function was not known until the end
of the 20th century [5], and the necessity of integration of hydrodynamic equations
was a reason of this fact.

Derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation as a partial case of dynamic equations,
describing the statistical ensemble of random particles (4.5), shows that the wave
function is simply a method of description of hydrodynamic equations, but not a
speciﬁc quantum object, whose properties are determined by the quantum princi-
ples. At such an interpretation of the wave function the quantum principles appear
to be superﬂuous, because they are necessary only for explanation, what is the wave
function and how it is connected with the particle properties. All remaining infor-
mation is contained in the dynamic equations. It appears that the quantum particle
is kind of stochastic particle, and all its exhibitions can be interpreted easily in terms
of the statistical ensemble of stochastic particles (4.5).

The idea of that, the quantum particle is simply a stochastic particle, is quite
natural. It was known many years ago [18]. However, the mathematical form of this
idea could not be realized for a long time because of the two problems considered
above (incorrect conception on the statistical ensemble of relativistic particles and
necessity of integration of the hydrodynamic equations).

Thus, we see in the example of the Schr¨odinger particle, that quantum systems
are a special sort of dynamic systems, which could be obtained from the statistical
ensemble of classical dynamic systems by means of a change of parameters P of the
dynamic system by its eﬀective value Peﬀ. In particular, the free uncharged particle
is described by an unique parameter: its mass m.

Here κ is the scalar ﬁeld of such a form, that eκ satisﬁes the inhomogeneous wave
equation.

Using proper change of variables, one can introduce the wave function, satisfying
the Klein-Gordon equation. At such a change of variables the κ-ﬁeld appears to be
hidden in the wave function and its remarkable properties appear to be hidden. As
well as the diﬀusion velocity udf in (4.6) the κ-ﬁeld κk describes the mean value of
the stochastic component of the particle velocity. In the non-relativistic case (4.6)
the 3-velocity udf is determined uniquely by its source (the density ρ of particles).
But the κ-ﬁeld is a relativistic ﬁeld, which may escape from its source and exist
separately from its source. Besides, the κ-ﬁeld can change the eﬀective particle
mass, as one can see from the expression (4.14) for the action. In particular, if

(cid:17)
the particle mass becomes imaginary. In this case the mean world line of the particle
is spacelike, and the pair production becomes to be possible. In other words, the
κ-ﬁeld can produce pairs [7].

The property of pair production is a crucial property of the quantum relativistic
physics. The classical ﬁelds (electromagnetic, gravitational) do not possess this
property. As we have seen in the second section the description in framework of
the conventional QFT has problems with the pair production description. There
is a hope, that the proper statistical description of several relativistic stochastic

16

particle will admit one to obtain the eﬀect pair production. For instance, maybe,
two colliding relativistic particles can produce pairs by means of their common κ-
ﬁeld. We hope that such a program may appear to be successful, provided the
proper formalism of the statistical ensemble will be developed. Today we have only
the developed formalism for statistical description of stochastic system consisting of
one emlon (WL). Formalism for statistical description of stochastic system consisting
of several emlons (WLs) is not yet developed properly.

5 Epistemological problems of quantum theory

Construction of the relativistic quantum theory is a very diﬃcult problem. But
solution of this problem depends not only on the diﬃculty of the problem in itself.
It depends also on qualiﬁcation of researchers, investigating this problem, on eﬀec-
tiveness of the applied investigation methods, on capability of researchers to logical
reasonings and on other factors. In this section we shall try analyze the character of
appearing diﬃculties. We shall separate them into two parts: objective diﬃculties
and subjective diﬃculties. The objective diﬃculties have been discussed. Further
we shall try to discuss subjective diﬃculties and mistakes. Discovery and correction
of these mistakes is diﬃcult because of their subjective character.

In our opinion, the main diﬃculty is a deﬁcit of logic (dominance of the trial
and error method over logic) at the construction of the quantum relativistic theory.
In particular, this deﬁcit of logic is displayed in disregard of demands, imposed by
the relativity principles. Let us consider brieﬂy the history of the question. In the
beginning of the 20th century there were attempts of constructon of the nonrelativis-
tic quantum mechanics as a statistical description of stochastic particles. In these
attempts the statistical description was considered to be a probabilistic description.
Incompatibility of the probabilistic description with the relativity principles was
not known, because one ignored the circumstance that the world line (but not the
particle) was the physical object. Because of this mistake one could not construct
the statistical conception of the quantum mechanics. One succeeded to construct
the axiomatic conception of quantum mechanics by means of the trial and error
method. After this success the trial and error method became the principal investi-
gation method in the quantum theory. The trial and error method had the success
and became to be predominant, because it was insensitive to mistakes in the fun-
damental physical principles, whereas the classical investigation method, which run
back to Isaac Newton, was founded on the logic. The method, founded on logic
could not lead to correct results, if the fundamental physical principles contained
mistakes, or these principles were applied incorrectly.

In the ﬁrst half of the 20th century there were classics of physics, who knew and
used the classical logical method of investigation. In the last half of the 20th century,
there were only researchers, using the trial and error method. The predominancy
of the trial and error method is explained by two factors. Firstly, it appeared to
be successful in application to construction of the nonrelativistic quantum theory.

17

Secondly, the classical logical method appeared to be forgotten, because new gener-
ations of the researcher were educated on the example of the successful application
of the trial and error method, which was perceived as the only possible method of
investigation. Any ambitious theorist dreamed to invent such hypothesis (maybe,
very exotic), which could be explain at once the mass spectrum of elementary parti-
cles and solve other problems of QFT. Development of the microcosm physics turned
into competition of such hypotheses.

The circumstance, that the correct application of the relativity principles (the
correct application of the fact that the world line is a physical object) may be impor-
tant from the practical viewpoint became to be clear for the author of this paper after
investigation of the world line properties [6]. Two important results followed from
this paper: (1) the quantum mechanics as a statistical theory can be constructed,
if one uses the relativistic concept of the state and construct the statistical descrip-
tion without a use the probability theory [22, 23, 24], (2) the perturbation theory
at the second quantization may be eliminated, if the conservation law of physical
objects (world lines) is taken into account) [25]. The paper [6] was reported at the
seminar of the theoretical department of the Lebedev physical institute. Relation
to the paper was sceptical as far as results were obtained without any additional
suppositions (and this was unusual). Besides, many researchers did not believe, that
it was possible a classical description of the world line, making a zigzag in the time
direction. Further the calculation were tested and all objections were eliminated.

It was clear to the author of paper [6], that the ﬁrst and the second results were
incompatible. He believed that the quantum mechanics is the statistical descrip-
tion of random world lines and the quantum principles are to be corollaries of this
description. However, in that time the integration of hydrodynamic equations was
not known, and from the mathematical viewpoint the statistical description could
not be considered as a starting point of the quantum description. The second result
admitted one to separate the problem of the second quantization in to parts and to
solve exactly the one-emlon problem and the two-emlon problem without a use of
the perturbation theory. The author expected that the further development of the
second quantization led the problem into the blind alley, provided the ﬁtting is not
used. From his viewpoint it should prove that development of QFT in the direction
of the second quantization were erroneous.

No additional hypotheses were used, to avoid a charge in a use of erroneous
hypotheses, leading to a strange result (absence of the pair production). In partic-
ular, one uses neither the perturbation theory, no cut oﬀ the self-action at the time
tending to inﬁnity. (Usually the two hypotheses are always used). Under these con-
ditions the absence of the pair productions meant, that The strategy of the second
quantization in itself is erroneous, as far as the relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory,
where there is no pair production, cannot be true. When the corresponding paper
was submitted to a scientiﬁc journal, it was rejected on the basis of the review of
the referee, who wrote: ” I do not recommend the paper for publication, because
the author himself stated that in his method of quantization the pair production is
absent.” (The paper has not been published, and now it can be found only at the

18

site [26])

We see here a sample of logic, based on the trial and error method, which does
not accept the papers with a negative result. The referee does not admit existence
of other investigation methods other, than the trial and error method. Indeed, as
far as in the trial and error method all hypotheses are random, the tests leading to
a negative result are of no interest. In the logical investigation method the negative
result means that the starting premises are false (of course, if there are no mistakes
in the executed investigation). Unfortunately the approach of the referee is typical.
Most researchers are apt to use only the trial and error method and they cannot
imagine anything other than this method. In thirty years the author of this paper
had a chance to discuss the correctness of the second quantization problem with his
colleagues dealing with QFT. Some of them agreed that, maybe, the commutation
relation are incompatible with the dynamic equations. But at the same time they
stated that it means nothing, because QFT agrees with the experimental data very
well. The circumstance, that the experimental data are explained by means of the
inconsistent theory did not lead to objections from them. Such an approach is a
corollary of the predominant method of trial and error. We think that this method
is the main obstacle on the path of the relativistic quantum theory construction.
One can ﬁnd and correct mistakes in the theory, but a change of mentality needs
some time. This time may be rather long.

We have seen that the nonrelativistic quantum theory could be presented as a
statistical description of stochastic particles, if we apply the relativity principles
correctly and use the dynamic conception of the statistical description. In fact, the
nonrelativistic quantum theory was developed mainly by the trial and error method.
Appearance of quantum principles was a result of application of this method. The
trial and error method is an eﬀective method for investigation of single physical phe-
nomena of unknown nature, because it admits one to discover new concepts, which
are adequate to the considered phenomenon. However, the trial and error method is
inadequate for construction of a fundamental theory, because the fundamental the-
ory is a logical structure, which systematizes our knowledge. The systematization
needs a long logical reasonings, because it is based on several fundamental propo-
sitions. The systematization as well as the fundamental theory is very sensitive to
possible mistakes in the logical reasonings and in the mathematical calculations.
Any mistake should be analyzed and eliminated.

On the contrary, the trial and error method is insensitive to mistakes.

It is
multiple-path. Usually before obtaining a correct solution one suggests and tests
many diﬀerent hypotheses. Only one of them may appear to be true. As far as
the hypotheses are suggested occasionally, it is useless to analyze the erroneous
hypotheses. Such an analysis gives nothing, because the hypotheses do not connect
between themselves and with the obtained correct result.

If we use logical reasonings, based on the fundamental principles, and obtain an
incorrect result, it means that either we make a mistake, or the fundamental prin-
ciples are incorrect. Thus, at the logical approach we should discover and analyze
It is useful for a correction of our reasonings. At the engineering

approach to the construction of the fundamental theory, when one uses the trial and
error method, a discovery and an analysis of the possible mistake is useless. Fur-
thermore, it is possible such a case, when the obtained result is incorrect, although
it agrees with the experimental data. Let us illustrate this in the example, which
relates to the problem of the relativistic quantum theory construction.

In reality, the states of the Dirac particle, which are linear superposition of
conventional low frequency state with the high frequency state are unstable, because
in this case the 4-current jk = c2 ¯ψγkψ oscillates with the frequency of the order
Ω = mc2/¯h. The Dirac particle is charged. As a result the energy of the high
frequency excitation is radiated in the form of electromagnetic waves, and the Dirac
particle appears at the state, where the 4-current jk = c2 ¯ψγkψ is constant. Thus,
from the experimental viewpoint the additional high frequency degrees of freedom
of the Dirac particle do not exist, because they are not observable.

Can one discover these degrees of freedom theoretically from the analysis of
the Dirac particle? Yes, one can discover them at the scrupulous analysis in the
framework of the conventional quantum mechanics [20]. But they have not been
discovered. We are not sure, whether the theory of diﬀerential equations with small
parameter before the highest derivative was known in the ﬁrst half of the 20th
century, but it was deﬁnitely known in the last half of the 20th century. Nevertheless
the necessary analyses has not been produced, and the Dirac particle was considered
to be pointlike.

It is true that the high frequency degrees of freedom are not observable at low
energies, and they give no contribution to description of the Dirac particle in the
nonrelativistic case. One can assume that these degrees of freedom absent in the
nonrelativistic case, and this assumption agrees with the experimental data. How-
ever, at the high energy collisions of Dirac particles these degrees of freedom may be
excited and make an essential contribution to description of the high energy collision
process.

Why has one not discovered these degrees of freedom theoretically? Because
researchers used the trial and error method, where the only criterion of validity of
the theory is the agreement with experiment. The logical reasonings and mistakes
in consideration are of no importance, provided they do not violate agreement with
experiment. If we take into account that the nonrelativistic quantum theory was
created by means of the trial and error method, and three generations of the micro-
cosm researchers have been educated on the example of this method, we recognize

21

that the internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle could not be discovered
before the execution of the proper high energy experiments with Dirac particles.

The internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle were discovered at investi-
gation of the Dirac particle by dynamic methods [16], which use the logical approach
to investigation. The dynamic methods are attentive to the logic and to mistakes of
investigation. They are not oriented to the trial and error method and to agreement
with experiment.

Besides, investigation of the Dirac equation by the dynamic methods has shown
[17] that the description of internal degrees of freedom is nonrelativistic. It means
that the whole Dirac equation (5.1) is nonrelativistic equation, although it is written
in the relativistically covariant form. Nonrelativistic character of the Dirac equation
means mathematically, that the set of all solutions of the Dirac equation is not
invariant, in general, under some Poincar´e transformations.

From viewpoint of researchers, who believed only in experimental test (but not in
logic reasonings) the Dirac equation is relativistic, because only internal degrees of
freedom are described nonrelativistically, but these degrees of freedom are ignored at
the conventional approach. Publishing of the papers [16, 17] in the reviewed journal
appears to be impossible, because the referee declared that he cannot believe that
the Dirac equation be nonrelativistic. This declaration appears to be suﬃcient for
rejection of the paper. I think that the opinion of the referee reﬂects the viewpoint
of the statistical average researcher, and this opinion is erroneous.

Problem of the relativistic invariance of the Dirac equation is discussed in [17]
in details. Here we shall not go in details. We refer only to the theorem, formulated
by Anderson [21]. This theorem states: The symmetry group of dynamic equations,
written in the relativistically covariant form, coincides with the symmetry group of
absolute objects. The absolute objects are quantities, which are the same for all
solutions of the dynamic equations. In the Dirac equation (5.3) quantities Ak and
matrices γk are absolute objects. We set for simplicity Ak = 0. Then the symmetry
group of 4-vector Ak = 0 and of the unit matrix 4-vector γk is the group of translation
and the group of rotation around the direction deﬁned by the unit 4-vector γk. This
7-parametric group is a subgroup of the 10-parametric Poincar`e group. Hence, the
Dirac equation is not relativistic.

Thus, if the dynamic equations written in the relativistically covariant form
contain the unit timelike constant vector, we should suspect that dynamic equations

6 Necessity of the next modiﬁcation of the space-

time model

Thus, the quantum mechanics can be founded as a mechanics of stochastic particles.
However, it is not known, why the motion of free particles is stochastic and from
where the quantum constant appears. There are two variants of answer to these
questions.

1. The stochasticity of the free particle motion is explained by the space-time
properties, and the quantum constant is a parameter, describing the space-time
properties.

2. The stochasticity of the free particle motion is explained by the special quan-
tum nature of particles. The motion of such a particle distinguishes from the motion
of usual classical particle. There is a series of rules (quantum principles), determin-
ing the quantum particle motion. The universal character of the quantum constant
is explained by the universality of the quantum nature of all particles and other
physical objects. As to event space, it remains to be the same as at Isaac Newton.
It is quite clear that the ﬁrst version of explanation is simpler and more logical,
as far as it supposes only a change of the space-time geometry. The rest, including
the principles of classical physics, remains to be unchanged. The main problem of
the ﬁrst version was an absence of the space-time geometry with such properties.
In general, one could not imagine that such a space-time geometry can exist. As
a result in the beginning of the 20th century one chose the second version. After
a large work the necessary set of additional hypotheses (quantum principles) had
been invented. One succeeded to explain all nonrelativistic quantum phenomena.
However, an attempt of the quantum theory expansion to the relativistic phenomena
lead to the problem, which is formulated as join of nonrelativistic quantum principles
with the principles of the relativity theory.

23

In general, the question, why the motion of microparticles is stochastic, does
not relate directly to the problem of the relativistic quantum theory construction.
It relates only in the sense, that explanation of the stochasticity by the space-time
properties creates an entire picture of the world, where the good old classical prin-
ciples rule, and only the space-time properties are slightly changed. It is clear, that
explanation of quantum properties by a slight correction of the space-time prop-
erties is more attractive, than the substitution of principles of classical physics by
enigmatic quantum principles, which are incompatible with the relativity principles.
Besides, the correction of the space-time properties is very simple. It does not
demand an introduction of additional exotic space-time properties such as a space-
time stochasticity, or noncommutativity of coordinates in the space-time.

Correction of the space-time properties means a change of the world function σ

[27] of the space-time. It consists of three points [28, 29, 30].

1. One proves that the proper Euclidean geometry has the σ-immanence property.
It means that the proper Euclidean geometry is described entirely by its world
function σE, and all Euclidean prescriptions for construction of geometrical
objects and relations between them can be expressed in terms and only in
terms of the Euclidean world function σE.

2. It is supposed that any space-time geometry

has the σ-immanence property.
It means that all prescriptions of the geometry
for construction of geomet-
rical objects and relations between them can be obtained from the Euclidean
prescription by a proper deformation of the Euclidean geometry, i.e. by the
change of the Euclidean world function σE by the world function σ of the
in all Euclidean prescriptions.

≤

In the space-time with nonvanishing distortion D (σM) the particle mass is ge-
ometrized [31], and motion of free particles is stochastic. The distortion function
D (σM) describes the character of quantum stochasticity. Form of the distortion
function D (σM) is determined by the demand that the stochasticity generated by
distortion is the quantum stochasticity, i.e. the statistical description of the free
stochastic particle motion is equivalent to the quantum description in terms of the
Schr¨odinger equation [31].

7 Concluding remarks

We have considered two possible strategies of the relativistic quantum theory con-
struction. The ﬁrst strategy, founded on the application of the conventional quantum
technique to relativistic systems, leads either to inconsistent conception or to the
consistent theory, where the pair production does not appear for interactions of the
degree type.

The second strategy is founded on the construction of the fundamental theory,
which relates to the conventional nonrelativistic quantum theory approximately in
such a way as the statistical physics relates to the axiomatic thermodynamics. The
fundamental theory is conventional relativistic classical theory in the space-time,
whose geometry is slightly modiﬁed in such a way, that motion of free particles is
primordially stochastic and the particle mass is geometrized. The quantum con-
stant appears as a parameter of the space-time geometry. Statistical description of
stochastic nonrelativistic particle motion appears to be equivalent to the conven-
tional quantum description. There is no necessity to postulate the quantum princi-
ples, because they may be obtained as a corollary of such a statistical description of
nonrelativistic stochastic particles.

There is a hope that the direct application of the statistical description to rela-
tivistic stochastic systems admits one to construct the relativistic quantum theory.
The fundamental theory admits one to use only the logical investigation method of
Isaac Newton. The fundamental theory is free of application of the trial and error
method, which is the main obstacle on the path of the relativistic quantum theory
construction. Predominance of the trial and error method in the 20th century gen-
erated a speciﬁc mentality of contemporary researchers, when the researcher tries
to suggest new hypotheses and to guess the result but not to derive it by the logi-
cal way from the fundamental physical principles. This mentality is a very serious
obstacle on the path of the relativistic quantum theory construction.

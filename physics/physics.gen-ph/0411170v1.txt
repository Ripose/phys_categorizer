We show the existence of a continuum of Hamiltonian structures for the two-dimensional isotropic
harmonic oscillator. In particular, a continuum of Hamiltonian structures having noncommutative
coordinates is presented. A study of the symmetries of these structures is performed and their
physical plausibility is discussed.

PACS numbers: 45.20.Jj, 02.40.Gh

It is well known that for some equations of motion
there exist inequivalent Hamiltonian/Lagrangian struc-
tures. This is the so-called inverse problem in variational
calculus [1]. It is also well known that these alternative
structures yield diﬀerent quantum theories [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
In this work we present a continuum of Hamiltonian
structures for the two-dimensional isotropic harmonic
oscillator;
in particular, a continuum of Hamiltonian
structures with noncommutative coordinates. We also
perform a study of their symmetries.

{x, y}α = cos α/mω,
{y, py}α = sin α,

{x, px}α = − sin α,
{px, py}α = mω cos α,

and zero otherwise. From a straightforward calculation
it can be shown that for every α the equations of motion
are

˙x = px/m = {x, Hα}α,
˙y = py/m = {y, Hα}α,

˙px = −mω2x = {px, Hα}α,
˙py = −mω2y = {py, Hα}α,

To begin with, let us recall that the usual Hamiltonian
structure for the two-dimensional isotropic harmonic os-
cillator is given by the Hamiltonian

i.e., this is a continuum of Hamiltonian structures for the
two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The cases
α = π/2 and α = π were recently reported in Ref.
[7].
Notice that for α 6= (2n + 1)π/2, with n an integer, after
quantizing the system we will have a noncommutative
space in the coordinates.

with Poisson brackets

{x, px}0 = 1,

{y, py}0 = 1,

zero otherwise.

The rotational invariance is an important symmetry of
the isotropic harmonic oscillator. This symmetry is com-
patible with the usual Hamiltonian structure as H0 and
the Poisson brackets from Eq. (2) are both invariant un-
der rotations

It can be shown that also the Hamiltonian structure

y′ = x sin θ + y cos θ.

Notice that this symmetry has r2 = x2 + y2 as an
invariant. Another property physically observable is
that in the limit ω → 0 the oscillator becomes a free
particle. Clearly the usual Hamiltonian formulation
above is also compatible with this.

{x, px}β = − sin β,
{y, px}β = cos β,

{x, py}β = cos β,
{y, py}β = sin β,

and zero otherwise, yields the equation of motion (6) for
each β. The case β = 0 was also reported in Ref.
[7]
(see also Ref. [1]).

Now, let us consider the Hamiltonian structure given

by the Hamiltonian

Another Hamiltonian structure yielding the same

equations of motion (6) is formed by the Hamiltonian

{x, py}γ = cosh γ,

and zero otherwise. Once again, this structure yields the
equations of motion (6) for every γ.

Now, for each α, β and γ, the quantities

(13)

are conserved. It can be seen that they are, in fact, the
symmetry generators. For each α, the algebra of these
generators is

{D, L}α = 2H+ sin α,

(14)
{D, H±}α = 2ωH∓ cos α + (1 ∓ 1)ω2L sin α, (15)
(16)
{L, H±}α = −(1 ± 1)D sin α,
(17)

{H+, H−}α = 2ωD cos α,

whereas for each β,

{D, L}β = 2H+ sin β,

{D, H±}β = (1 ± 1)ω2L sin β,
{L, H±}β = 2H∓ cos β − (1 ± 1)D sin β,

{H+, H−}β = −2ω2L cos β,

(18)

(19)
(20)

(21)

and for each γ,

{D, L}γ = −2H− sinh γ,
{D, H±}γ = (1 ∓ 1)ω2L sinh γ,
(23)
{L, H±}γ = 2H∓ cosh γ − (1 ∓ 1)D sinh γ, (24)
(25)

{H+, H−}γ = 2ω2L cosh γ.

(22)

Notice that as the Lie algebra of the constants of mo-
tion depends on the values of α, β and γ; for each of
these values we will have a diﬀerent symmetry group. As
an example, for α = 0 the Hamiltonian Hα=0 and its
corresponding Poisson brackets are invariant under the
rotations deﬁned by Eq. (3) and also under the scaling
transformations

x′ = eλx,

y′ = e−λy,

(26)

which are particularly interesting because they mix long
and short scales together. The rotations are generated by
H+/ω and the scaling symmetry of Eq. (26) by −D/ω.
Notice that once α 6= 0, the rotational invariance is lost.
The Hamiltonian structures labeled β and γ are not rota-
tionally invariant either. However, in the case β = γ = 0,
the structure is invariant under the scaling transforma-
tions from Eq. (26) which are generated by L. In the
case β = π/2, the Hamiltonian structure is invariant un-
der the transformations

2

That is, this structure posses the Lorentz symmetry. For
this, the generator of the symmetry is L. Notice here
that the invariant associated to these transformations
is s2 = x2 − y2. On the other hand, it can be shown
that the generators of rotations for β = 0 and β = π are
L1 = xpx − ypy and L2 = xpy + ypx respectively. Both
of these are not conserved quantities; which conﬁrms
the fact that both systems have no rotational symmetry.
The alternative Hamiltonian structures here presented
have particular symmetries and, in this sense, they are
all diﬀerent.

In general, when the equations of motion of a phys-
ical system can be obtained from alternative Hamilto-
nian structures, it is diﬃcult to argue why one choses
the standard structure over the others [3, 5, 6]. For the
two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator and the al-
ternative structures here presented, this is not so compli-
cated. As explained above, the case α = 0 can be clearly
discarded because both Hα=0 and its corresponding Pois-
son brackets lose meaning in the limit ω → 0. The other
cases for α, β and γ can, in principle, be discarded be-
cause they have no rotational symmetry. Thus, the best
mathematical representation for this physical system is
provided by the usual Hamiltonian structure. This, how-
ever, does not mean one should fully neglect the others as
they may give a better representation of other systems
and, in addition, may have interesting properties. For
instance, in the Hamiltonian structure labeled α above,
if cos α 6= 0 we will have noncommutative spaces. That
is, we will have the commutation rules

[ˆx, ˆy] = i¯hΘ, Θ =

(28)

cos α
mω

.

Moreover, if cos α > 0, it can be shown that with these
commutation rules, the quantity ˆA = πˆr2 = π(ˆx2 + ˆy2),
has the spectrum [8, 9],

AN = 2π¯hΘ(N + 1/2), N = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(29)

i.e. the area is quantized. Some authors [10] believe that
the area of the horizon of events of a black hole has a spec-
trum of the form of Eq. (29). The Hamiltonian struc-
tures invariant under the scaling transformations from
Eq. (26) are also interesting because they mix diﬀerent
scales together. It is also notable that the structure with
β = π/2 posses the Lorentz symmetry despite it is a non
relativistic model.

Abstract

It is considered constraints imposed by the quantum mechanics on the mea-
surement of the density of the electromagnetic energy. First, the energy of the
electromagnetic wave and the volume (time) are bound with the Heisenberg un-
certainty principle.
It reduces from double to ordinary the relativistic eﬀect for
the density of the electromagnetic energy. Second, the frequency of photons and
the number of photons are bound with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Then
relativistic eﬀects for the frequency of photons and for the number of photons are
incompatible.

The energy density of the electromagnetic wave is given by

W =

=

E
V

E
St

where E is the energy of the electromagnetic wave, V is the volume, S is the cross-section,
t is the time. Let the source of the electromagnetic wave move with the velocity v relative
to the laboratory frame. Let an observer in the laboratory frame measure the energy
density of the electromagnetic wave. According to the special relativity [1], the energy of
the electromagnetic wave and the volume (the time) follow the Lorentz transformation.
Then the energy of the electromagnetic wave and the volume (the time) measured in
the laboratory frame are shifted with respect to those in the frame of the source. When
measuring the energy density of the electromagnetic wave emitted by the moving source,
we obtain the double relativistic eﬀect

W ′ =

W (1 − v2/c2)
(1 ± v/c)2

.

Electromagnetic wave is a quantum object. Then we should take into account quan-
tum mechanical constraints on the measurement of the density of the electromagnetic
energy. Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle we cannot simultaneously measure
the momentum and the space coordinate (the energy and the time) of the electromagnetic
wave. When determining the energy of the electromagnetic wave emitted in the moving
frame, we cannot determine the volume (the time) in the moving frame and should use the
volume (the time) determined in the laboratory frame. Then, the energy of the electro-
magnetic wave is shifted in accordance with the Lorentz transformation, but the volume
(the time) is taken as a laboratory one. As a result we obtain the ordinary relativistic
eﬀect for the density of the electromagnetic energy

Thus, due to quantum mechanical constraints, the conventional formula of the relativistic
eﬀect for the density of the electromagnetic energy given by eq. (2) is not correct. Instead
of this we should use the formula given by eq. (3).

Consider electromagnetic wave as a bunch of photons with the frequency ω. The

luminosity of the bunch of photons is given by

L =

=

E
St

n¯hω
St

(4)

where n is the number of photons, ¯h is the Planck constant. The luminosity of the bunch
of photons emitted by the moving source suﬀers the ordinary relativistic shift given by
eq. (3). In the bunch of photons, the frequency and the number of photons are bound
with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Hence we cannot simultaneously determine
the frequency of photons and the number of photons. Hence relativistic eﬀects for the
frequency of photons and for the number of photons can be measured in the diﬀerent
incompatible experiments. When measuring the frequency of photons emitted by the
moving source, the number of photons is taken as a laboratory one, and the frequency
of photons suﬀers the Doppler shift, ω ∝ (1 − v2/c2)1/2/(1 ± v/c). When measuring the
luminosity of the bunch of photons, the frequency of photons is taken as a laboratory
one, and the number of photons is shifted as n ∝ (1 − v2/c2)1/2/(1 ± v/c). Under the
conventional approach, when measuring the luminosity of the bunch of photons in the
moving frame, we determine both the Doppler shift of the photon’s frequency and the
shift of the number of photons. However this contradicts to the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle.

Thus the quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,

imposes con-
straints on the measurement of the density of the electromagnetic energy. First, it reduces
from double to ordinary the relativistic eﬀect for the density of the electromagnetic energy.
Second, relativistic eﬀects for the frequency of photons and for the number of photons are
incompatible.

Geometry and physics of today

Anastasios Mallios

Abstract

The “geometry”, in the sense of the classical diﬀerential geometry of smooth

manifolds (CDG), is put under scrutiny from the point of view of Abstract

Diﬀerential Geometry (ADG), along with resulting, thereby, potential physical

consequences, in what, in particular, concerns physical “gauge theories”, when

the latter are viewed as being, anyway, of a “geometrical character”. Yet, “phys-

ical geometry”, in connection with physical laws and the associated with them,

within the context of ADG, “diﬀerential” equations (whence, no background

spacetime manifold is needed thereat), are also under discussion.

“αǫ´ι o θǫ´oς γǫωµǫτ ρǫ˜ι”

(:“eternally the God geometrizes”)

1. By looking at the previous famous utterance (attributed to Plato, according

to Plutarch, see e.g. D.E. Smith [31: p. 88, ft. 4]) as in the above frontispiece, while

taking also into account our nowadays conception of Physics, we can say that;

(1.1)

“physical geometry” is the outcome of the physical laws.

In this regard, one might also refer here, for instance, still to M. Faraday, as he is

quoted by H. Weyl [35: p. 169], in that [emphasis below is ours]:

“... not the ﬁeld should derive its meaning through its associ-

(1.2)

ation with matter, but, conversely, ... particles of matter are

... singularities of the ﬁeld.”

Anastasios Mallios

Now, by looking at the technical correspondence/association,

(1.3)

physical law ←→ A-connection,

one realizes that (1.1) might also be construed, as an equivalent analogue of the

implication;

A-connection (: physical law ) =⇒ curvature

(1.4)

(: “geometry”, alias, “shaping”).

Consequently, still to repeat (1.1), thus, said it otherwise, one concludes that;

it is actually the physical laws, that make, what we might call (physical)

(1.5)

“geometry”.

Of course, we take for granted, concerning the above terminology, the meaning of the

technical term, “A-connection”, for which we refer thus, for instance, to A. Mallios

[12], or even to [13], [17].

above on the word,

Now, it is worthwhile to comment here, a bit more, on the inverted commas, put

(1.6)

geometry.

Indeed, the same are meant, as well as, hint, therein, at the technical and also

fundamental, in point of fact, issue, which the aforesaid (Greek) word contains in

itself; namely, the entanglement of ourselves, in that point of view, or even, the

manner we look at that notion, as this is implemented/understood, exactly, by the

second component of the same word (the latter being, in eﬀect, a composed one,

that is, the Greek verb, “metr¯o” (: measure). Accordingly, any time we refer to/use

that notion, by deﬁnition, viz. by the real essence of the same word,

the term “geometry” does not actually correspond to/means something

(1.7)

physical (: real), but, simply, a model of ours, pertaining to the descrip-

tion of reality (in whatever sense of the latter concept).

Furthermore, it is still appropriate to remind us, at this point, of A. Einstein’s

maxim, in that;

Geometry and Physics of Today

3

“Time and space are modes by which we think, not conditions in which

(1.8)

we live”.

See thus, for instance, Yu.I. Manin [24: p. 71], as well as, within actually the same

vein of ideas, (1.29) in the sequel. [Emphasis in (1.8) above is ours, as it will also be

the case, occasionally, in quotations, throughout the sequel]. Yet, we mention here

the relevant remarks of P.G. Bergmann [3: p. 33], in that,

“Einstein ... did not consider geometrization of physics a foremost or

(1.9)

even a meaningful objective...”

(I am indebted here to I. Raptis for bringing to my attention the previous citation

of Bergmann). Yet, the same author, as above (loc. cit.), insists in that, what is of

importance here is,

(1.10)

“... not a geometric formulation or picturization but a ... fusing of the

mathematical structures intended to represent physical ﬁelds.”

We remark here that the above are still in accord with (1.1) or (1.5) in the preceding.

Thus, we are led again, herewith, to a

(1.11)

“relational aspect” of what we might call, “physical geometry”.

In other words, we thus arrive at something, which is more close to what, as we still

mentioned above, we have already said by (1.5). Furthermore, this same aspect is

also akin to what we may understand, as we shall see later on, when speaking of

“geometry”, determined by “diﬀerential” equations, yet, the “solution

space” of the latter. The same might still be conceived, even, as the

(1.12)

source(!) of the “cartesian point of view”; however, see also (1.14) in the

sequel, concerning that perspective, within the present abstract (thus,

space-independent (!)) setting.

So, still, within the aforesaid context (see also e.g. (1.11)), we can further say that;

“geometrization” of physics means, in point of fact, “arithmetization”

(1.13)

of the same, for our “geometry” is, in eﬀect, “arithmetical”, that is,

“cartesian”(!), in character, hence, not a physical (: natural) one!

Consequently, one comes to realize that,

Anastasios Mallios

the previous association becomes thus more natural, to the extent that

it is more “relational”(!), in nature.

However, what is also here of a particular signiﬁcance, concerning the whole subject

matter of the present work, the preceding point of view, as in (1.12), is actually

4

(1.14)

meant in an

(1.15)

ner,

entirely “space independent” way, that is, not in a “cartesian-wise” man-

as this also will become clear, along with the terminology applied herewith, through

the subsequent discussion. That is, in other words, based on the abstract formalism

of the same technique of Abstract Diﬀerential Geometry (ADG), one is able to

formulate “diﬀerential” equations without having the need to resort to

(1.16)

any background (“cartesian”–“newtonian”, so to say) “space”, to work

with.

This latter situation might be, in point of fact, as we shall see in the sequel, of

paramount signiﬁcance for problems of quantum gravity, when the same problems are

viewed from the standard perspective, viz. from that one of the classical diﬀerential
geometry of smooth (: C∞-)manifolds (CDG).

So, in accordance with (1.11), one gets, indeed, at a “leibnizian”, so to say, point

of view, that is, by following Leibniz himself,

(1.17)

we should ﬁnd a “geometrical calculus” that operates directly on the

“geometrical objects” without the intervention of coordinates.

In this regard, we may even remark here, anyway, that the latter function, as above

(: coordinates) is, for that matter,

(1.18)

“... an act of violence”.

See thus H. Weyl [36: 90]. On the other hand, concerning (1.17), cf., for instance,

N. Bourbaki [5: Chapt. I; p. 161, ft. 1]. Furthermore, within the same context, one

has here the relevant remarks of B. Riemann, in that;

(1.19)

“Speciﬁcations of mass [: measurements] require an independence of

quantity from position, which can happen in more than one way”.

Geometry and Physics of Today

5

Cf., for example, A. Mallios [14: (1.3)]. Thus, in toto, the preceding sustain, indeed,

the aspect that:

(1.20)

the description of the physical laws, something that could also include

the quantum r´egime, as well, should be made in such a manner, that

no supporting space, or even space scaﬀolding (: framework), essentially

contributing to that description, is to be included in our “calculations”

(: rationale); hence, the latter have thus to be entirely independent of

any notion of “space” of the aforesaid type.

Now, the previous aspect of “description of physical laws”, as in (1.20), can, in point

of fact, be conceived, as just referring to the very “geometrical calculus” `a la Leibniz

(cf.

(1.17)), hence, to this same “geometry”(!), in that respect, in the sense of

Leibniz, or even, to its “relational point of view”, according to (1.11). Furthermore,

the same perspective of

(1.21)

“geometry”, as “description(study) of physical laws”,

leads, of course, simply, to the aspect of,

(1.22)

doing “geometry”, via “diﬀerential” equations (a fact that actually goes

back to Ren´e Descartes himself: “Analytic Geometry”),

as exactly hinted at, already, by (1.12) in the foregoing. Now, we are just going

to comment further on the latter aspect, as appeared, within the present abstract

setup of ADG, straightforwardly, by the next Section, making thus also still, more

clear, our previous remarks in (1.16), as above.

2. “Diﬀerential” equations in the setting of ADG. Functoriality.− As

already mentioned above, our aim, by the following discussion, is virtually to clarify

(1.16), and to look also at further consequences thereat:

Thus, to start with, we can certainly remark that, one of the most eﬀective

methods, thus far, of describing physical laws has been, of course, that one, provided

by “diﬀerential equations”; hence, the foremost applications thereof of the (classical)

diﬀerential geometry (CDG, indeed, Calculus(!), yet, of “the glittering trappings of

Analysis”, to recall here G.D. Birkhoﬀ; see, for instance, A. Weinstein [34: p.1, ft.2]).

6

Anastasios Mallios

However, the latter (viz. the classical) way of describing physical laws contains

in itself, already, the seeds of the defaults, that exactly should be avoided, just by

virtue of our previous remarks, as in (1.20). Indeed, by the very characters of the

classical theory (: CDG), its whole machinery (mechanism) is entirely rooted on the

supporting space (viz. on the “locally euclidean” smooth manifold). Accordingly,

simply, as a result of (1.20), one concludes that;

(2.1)

the notion of a (locally euclidean–smooth–)manifold proves thus not

to be the appropriate one(!), in order to describe physical laws (: the

“reality”) to the extent, at least, that the latter refer to the quantum

deep, as well.

In this context, we may still recall herewith, the relevant comments of A. Einstein

himself, pertaining, in point of fact, to the

(2.2)

inappropriateness of the manifold concept for physical reality(!).

See, for instance, A. Mallios [16: (1.6)]. On the other hand, one can further say

that,

(2.3)

the aforementioned drawback of the notion of smooth manifold in prob-

lems connected with the quantum deep is mainly due, not only (!) to the

way, we consider arising the “diﬀerential-geometric” mechanism, within

the context of CDG (see thus, however, (3.3) in the sequel), but,

(2.3.1)

much more, because we still keep, as a “working framework”,

the whole “space”, viz. the entire smooth manifold itself,

by further looking at it, even locally, as domain of deﬁnition of what we

deﬁne, as “diﬀerentiable functions”.

Now, the latter point of view, as mentioned in (2.3) above, proves to be, by concrete

working examples we present below, a quite unnatural way of trying to apply the

“diﬀerential geometric mechanism” of CDG, its character being, in point of fact,

entirely algebraic(!), as we are still going to clarify in the sequel. Furthermore, it

is this same aspect, as above, where we are usually confronted with an extremely

pestilential anomaly of the classical theory, pertaining, in particular, to the quantum

Geometry and Physics of Today

7

deep, this being thus, indeed, the main source of “inﬁnities” (: “singularities”)!

Notwithstanding, all these anomalies, without actually being real ones (!) (cf. thus

the aforementioned examples, as presented by the ensuing discussion).

On the other hand, we further illuminate the situation that appears, within the

quantum framework, when looking at it from the point of view of the abstract theory,

summarizing thus brieﬂy the relevant conclusions into the following.

Scholium 2.1.− When looking at the fundamental of quantum theory,

in con-

junction with potential applications in that context of (diﬀerential) geometry, one

actually realizes that;

we usually associate numbers (`a la Descartes) to a space that, in eﬀect,

does not exist(!), in the sense, at least, we ascribe to it, that “spatial per-

(2.4)

spective” of ours being, in point of fact, always cartesian(!), something,

of course, which is not in accord with our (experimental) knowledge, as

it concerns the quantum r´egime.

Thus, we are, indeed, trapped here, by our own perspective, due actually to our pre-

existent assumption, pertaining, as a matter of fact, to the manner we consider our

“calculus” (hence, of course, that same instrumental issue of (classical) diﬀerential

geometry, as well) is virtually arrived, this being thus, according to the classical

theory, “locally euclidean”, viz. “newtonian”, in nature (: manifold ↔ spacetime).

Therefore, as a consequence, we are thus

unable to apply the classical (: newtonian) aspect of diﬀerential geometry

in the “quantum deep”, due mainly to the emergence of the so-called

“singularities”, and other relevant anomalies.

[As already said, several

(2.5)

times in the preceding, the latter phenomenon being actually due to the

particular type of our (“smooth”) functions involved, that “smoothness”

being, in turn, a direct outcome of the sort of “space” (: locally euclidean)

we use!].

Consequently, once more,

8

Anastasios Mallios

it is not the functions we use (viz., when considering them, as carriers of

the “diﬀerential geometric-mechanism”, from the point of view of ADG,

that is, so to say, in the “leibnizian” perspective of the latter term),

(2.6)

which are inappropriate, concerning the quantum deep, but, simply, the

“space”, on which the said functions are supposed to be deﬁned, such a

space, as that one we try to apply (viz. the “locally euclidean” one),

being virtually non-existent(!), in that context, and not only this,

given that,

an “arithmetical space”, as it actually is the standard “euclidean/car-

tesian space”, which we usually employ in the classical theory (: CDG),

is not, of course, “physical” (: real)(!), as this is, in eﬀect, realized when,

in particular, referring to the “quantum deep”.

[We thus get, in that

context, even an “experimental” (: concrete) ascertainment of the in-

eﬀectiveness of our (spatial) model!]. That is, the “space” model, we

usually ascribe in our physical theories, to what we actually understand,

(2.7)

as “physical space”, is entirely a numerical one”. In that context, we

are inﬂuenced, of course, from our own successes, so far, in the macro-

scopic world. This model, however, collapses when confronted with the

quantum deep.

So, in other words, we are thus entrapped, in that respect, by the particular suc-

cess, thus far, of the aforesaid point of view (: the classical one), in what, namely,

especially concerns our experience/applications “in the large”.

Now, within the same vein of ideas, and still, in connection with the (categorical),

in eﬀect, correspondence amongst “space” and functions, one actually has, in that

respect, the following “identiﬁcation”,

(2.8)

functions ⇄ space, “Gel’fand duality”

which we may also call (already depicted above), Gel’fand duality”, a fact strikingly

pointed out, in its full generality, by the language of the theory of (especially, non-

normed) Topological Algebras (see, for instance, A. Mallios [TA; p. 223, Theorem

1.2, as well as, p. 227, Theorem 2.1]).

Geometry and Physics of Today

Now, as already hinted at in the foregoing, and which will also be considered, by

the ensuing discussion, the previous situation, has nothing to do, in eﬀect, with

the mechanism itself of the aforesaid classical theory (: diﬀerential geometry), the

same machinery being essentially “leibnizian”(!), in nature, as this, indeed, has

been pointed out, by what we may call “Abstract Diﬀerential Geometry” (: ADG);

see thus A. Mallios [13], as well as, [17].

In toto, the preceding represent the way one may look at what we usually un-

derstand, nowadays, as “space” (speaking, of course, in terms, of what we call

“mathematical physics”). True, the previous thoughts are actually the outcome of

our experience derived from ADG, while the same still supplies potential applica-

tions in problems of quantum relativity, as the latter has been explained already in

other places (see, for instance, A. Mallios [17], as well as, A. Mallios–I. Raptis [20],

[21]). So it is this entirely new (axiomatic) perspective of ADG, pertaining to the

inherent mechanism of the classical diﬀerential geometry (: CDG), which provides

several potential applications, while the same mechanism proves, very likely, to be

also in accord with the “spatial” situation, one is confronted with in the quantum

deep, as already hinted at, by the foregoing discussion; in this regard, see also e.g.

A. Mallios–E.E. Rosinger [23], along with A. Mallios–I. Raptis [21]. On this latter

aspect we are still going to present, however, some further illuminating comments,

through the subsequent discussion, as well.

On the other hand, by looking at the whole classical set-up from the point of view

of ADG, we can still point out here that, by complete contrast with the situation,

which usually dominates the classical case,

the framework of ADG does not, in principle, depend on any background

“space” (: carrier, think e.g. of “space-time” for the classical domain),

(2.9)

that would contribute to its “diﬀerential” equipment, the latter being

thus entirely rooted on A(!), our “generalized arithmetics”, alias, “sheaf

of coeﬃcients”.

Yet, the latter issue in (2.6), as above, constitutes, in point of fact, still,

(2.10)

the quintessence of the quantum ﬁeld-theoretic character of ADG.

Indeed, the whole set-up of ADG becomes, by its very deﬁnition, susceptible of

10

Anastasios Mallios

(2.11)

formulating our equations in a quantum ﬁeld-theoretic manner,

viz.

quantum-relativistically!

In this connection, see also our previous relevant

remarks in A. Mallios [14: (9.8), (9.23), along with Section 11 therein]. Yet, to put

the above subject matter still in an equivalent way, we can further remark here that;

it is actually we, who describe the (physical) laws, read, “diﬀerential”

equations, by means of our “arithmetics”, thus, for the case at issue,

through the (C-algebra) sheaf A, while the same machinery (: calculus”,

(2.12)

`a la Leibniz, or even “diﬀerential geometry”) is still based on A, and not

on any background “space”, at all(!), as it was classically the case. Of

course, this latter fact may be of paramount importance, when one is

confronted with problems of quantum gravity.

In this regard, one may still refer to the relevant comments of J. Baez [2: beginning

of Preface], in that (emphasis below is ours):

“A fundamental problem with quantum ... gravity ...

is that in ...

(2.13)

general relativity there is no background geometry to work with: the

geometry of spacetime itself becomes a dynamical variable”.

On the other hand, the aforementioned (see (2.9), (2.12))

(2.14)

independence of the “diﬀerential” mechanism of ADG from any back-

ground space, gives to that mechanism the possibility to be considered,

as, a “variable” entity too, the same being, by its very construction, en-

tirely based on (reduced to) A; therefore, what we also understand, as

“diﬀerential” geometry (: “geometrical calculus”, `a la Leibniz), entailed

thereof, becomes still a “variable”, as well.

Furthermore, that also appears fundamental, herewith, the same “geometrical calcu-

lus”, hence, the concomitant “geometry” too, becomes simply “relational”, referring

thus directly to the “geometrical objects” (in our case, vector sheaves) themselves,

without the interference, of any “space”, in the classical sense of the latter term.

In this connection, we also recall, for convenience, technically speaking, that:

We suppose herewith that we are thinking, in terms of an (abstract) “diﬀerential

Geometry and Physics of Today

11

setting”, based on a given “diﬀerential triad”,

(2.15)

(A, ∂, Ω)

over an (arbitrary, in general) topological space X, base space of all the sheaves

involved, throughout. Now, within that context, a “geometrical object”, thus, for

instance, an elementary particle, can be associated with what we call a Yang-Mills

ﬁeld, viz. a pair

(2.16)

(E, D),

consisting of a vector sheaf E on X and an A-connection D on E; see e.g. A. Mallios

[16: (3.2), (3.3)], or even [17: Chapt. VI]. It is actually in terms of such pairs, as

above, that “diﬀerential” equations, in the framework of ADG are referred (loc.

cit.).

(: ADG), in that;

Thus, within the above set-up, we can further refer here to a fundamental prin-

ciple, in eﬀect, of the whole machinery, thus far, of Abstract Diﬀerential Geometry

(2.17)

everything, that we want to ascribe to a pair (E, D), as above, is virtually

reduced to a similar condition/asumption for the pair (A, ∂), see (2.15),

yet, occasionally, under appropriate (in principle, only(!))

topological

hypotheses for X (see also the subsequent comments).

As already noted before, the context of (2.17) exhibits, in point of fact, the “Leitmo-

tiv” that actually dominates the very technique of ADG; see thus A. Mallios [VS],

or even [17]. On the other hand, the same ensures also the

(2.18)

“covariance” of the whole setting of ADG, with respect to A.

Thus, the “variance” here is always relative to our own “arithmetics”, or even

(generalized) domain of coeﬃcients”, yet, “structure sheaf ” A (by assumption, a

unital commutative C-algebra sheaf on X, cf. (2.15)), which, for that matter, is,
of course, the case, as well; so, strictly speaking, it is actually we always, who

measure(!)/calculate, while, and this is also of a particular importance, as already

pointed out in the preceding, this whole framework/calculations of ADG, without

12

Anastasios Mallios

actually leaning upon any background “space” (: carrier), as, for instance, “space-

time”(!) of the classical case.

On the other hand, we can further say that;

(2.19)

physical laws are always “functorial”.

Of course, in point of fact, we “abuse language” here, when referring to the above

statement, as explained by the following.

Note 2.1.− Looking at the sense, we actually use the term,

“functorial”

as in (2.19) above, and also in conjunction with (1.2) in the preceding,

we should still remark here that;

the aforesaid term is always meant, with respect, in eﬀect, to

(2.20)

us(!), viz. relative to (our “generalized arithmetics”) A.

Therefore, what we actually consider in (2.19) is, in point of fact, the

manifestation of the physical laws!

Now, this goes, of course, hand in hand, with (or even, it is something that is,

in point of fact, an equivalent expression of) the “principle of general covariance”.

Accordingly, by considering now, as we did it in the preceding, diﬀerential equations,

as expressing physical laws (see (1.5), (1.12)), we can realize that, indeed,

diﬀerential equations should be, by their very deﬁnitions, “functorial”,

(2.21)

in nature! Consequently, their formulation should be made, in terms of

“functorial objects”, as well.

Now, by the last term, when speaking in technical language, we mean, of course,

something that, by deﬁnition, is A-invariant, alias a “tensor”, in the sense that it

respects our “arithmetics” A.

Furthermore, (2.19) can still be construed, as an outcome of (1.2), in conjunction

with (1.5) in the preceding. Thus, by further considering (see also (2.20), as above)

the

Geometry and Physics of Today

13

physical laws, as the manifestation of the (deepest physical) dynamics

(: “causality”), one comes to the conclusion that;

(2.22.1)

“dynamics” should be “functorial”, as well,

(2.22)

whenever we actually eﬀectuate it (viz. the physical law, cf. also (1.4)).

Therefore, this very realization of it (by us(!), of course) becomes “func-

torial”, or even “tensorial” too, hence, the same physis of the curvature

(: “geometry”), see also (1.4), as before.

Now, by further commenting on our last conclusion, as above, we still recall that,

according to our axiomatics,

the curvature (: ﬁeld strength) is the manifestation (eﬀectuation) of the

“identiﬁcation” (correspondence, cf. also (1.4)),

(2.23)

(2.23.1)

dynamics (: “causality”) ←→ (A-)connection,

therefore (see also (2.22.1)), the tensorial (functorial, cf. (2.20)) aspect

of the curvature.

In this connection, we can still note that the aforementioned functorial/tensorial

character of the curvature, in the sense, of course, of (2.20), being always the outcome

(ﬁeld strength) of a given “ﬁeld” (: A-connection, see, for instance, A. Mallios [16:

(3.15)] or even [14: (3.21.1)]) is further expressed, by the familiar relation,

yet, equivalently (precisely speaking, in terms of the formalism of ADG), by the

(2.24)

relation;

(2.24)

∇ρ = 0,

DHom(E,E ∗)(˜ρ) = 0,

where we still have;

(2.26)

Hom(E, E ∗) = E ∗ ⊗A E ∗ = (E ⊗A E)∗.

See A. Mallios [VS: Chapt. VII; p. 165, (8.70), along with Chapt. IV; p. 302, Theo-

rem 6.1 and p. 305: (6.16)]; thus, we have herewith the so-called, classically, “Levi-

Civita identity”. By further referring to the above notation, we consider therein a

14

(2.28)

(2.29)

Anastasios Mallios

given Yang-Mills ﬁeld

see loc. cit., Chapt. IX; p. 244, along with (2.15), as above, while ρ stands there

for a Riemannian A-metric on E, “compatible with D” (ibid., Chapt. VII; Section

8). It is worth noticing here that the previous condition on the pair

as above, is actually the upshot of a similar assumption for the standard pair,

(E, D),

(D, ρ),

(A, ∂),

cf. (2.14), under appropriate supplementary conditions on the items involved here-

with, these being in the case of X, only topological ones (cf.

thus (2.16) in the

preceding); yet, in that context, see also A. Mallios [VS: Chapt. VII; p. 168, The-

orem 9.1: Fundamental

lemma of Riemannian vector sheaves]. Accordingly, we

further understands here that (: “physical signiﬁcance” of (2.25)),

(2.30)

to “realize” the curvature, one has to “compare” it with something else!

We terminate the present Section with the subsequent remarks of N. Bohr, as quoted

e.g., by S.Y. Auyang [1: p. 229]), referring to the way one actually has to look at the

Nature; indeed, with the same remarks the foregoing rationale and related remarks

thereon are really in accord, as it actually concerns our relevance, with respect to

the observed physical laws, which, technically speaking, as it was pointed out in

the preceding, is expressed, in eﬀect, through the “structure sheaf ” A, independently

of any surrounding/supporting “space”. Thus, according to the aforementioned

remarks (emphasis below is ours),

“It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to point out how nature

(2.31)

is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature.”

Consequently, to follow in that context the favorite parlance of A. Einstein him-

self, we thus always “describe”, hence, not explain (!), the physical applications

Geometry and Physics of Today

15

of every day life being, therefore, simply, consequences of the former (descrip-

tions), as above(!). Yet, within the same vein ideas, we may still quote, herewith,

L. Wittgenstein [38: p. 17], in that;

(2.32)

cases”.

“Physics does not explain anything;

it simply describes concomitant

(Emphasis above is ours). Therefore, as already emphasized in the preceding, we

do not actually explain “anything”, through Physics, as it concerns the physical

laws (: physis), but, just, describe/study their consequence(!); notwithstanding, as a

consequence, however, of the latter function, it undoubtedly seems (cf. applications)

that,

(2.33)

we do understand, nevertheless, several times and, of course, always, to

a certain extent(!), the way that these laws work !

3. ADG, as applicable in the quantum deep.− Our purpose, by the

ensuing discussion, as the title of this Section indicates, is to further clarify the way

one can look at a potential application of ADG in the quantum r´egime, thus, in point

of fact, of the very mechanism of the classical (: “newtonian”) diﬀerential geometry,

very eﬀective(!), for that matter, so far, however, now, within the aforesaid domain,

but, already from the point of view of ADG (viz. axiomatically), thus, freed from

its “beautiful shackles” (C.J. Isham); indeed, it is proved that the latter obstacles

are due, simply, to the entanglement, according to the classical theory, of the same

mechanism with the “locally euclidean” nature of that theory (in eﬀect, much more,

because of the maintenance of the whole “smooth setting”, as a working framework,

in this context, cf. also (2.3) in the preceding), the latter being also considered, in

view of the same standard theory (CDG), the only source(!), within that context, of

the all powerful (inﬁnitesimal/integral) Calculus, hence, of the classical diﬀerential-

geometric machinery, as well. So, it is here exactly that a supreme didagma of ADG

comes just to the foreground, in fact;

the diﬀerential-geometric mechanism of the classical diﬀerential geom-

etry (CDG)–being,

in eﬀect, of a leibnizian character–can, equally

(3.1)

well, be supplied, by other sources, apart from a “locally euclidean”

space/(smooth) manifold, its existence being thus independent of any

such “space”.

16

Anastasios Mallios

Furthermore, as already pointed out in the preceding (see, for instance, the quoted

citations, in that context, of Einstein, Feynman, Isham), a “space”, as in the latter

part of (3.1), together with its “diﬀerential set-up”, is entirely out of the question

for the quantum deep(!).

On the other hand, by further commenting, within the preceding vein of ideas,

on the basis of our experience from ADG, as exposed above, we realize that one can

virtually interrelate well-known phenomena in the past with still existing tendencies

in quantum physics of today:

Thus, the heuristic opposition of Einstein against Quantum Field Theory (: “the

other Einstein”, see e.g. J. Stachel [33: p. 283, 285]) might also be viewed, apart

from other physical reasons, still, as an outcome of the failure of classical diﬀerential

geometry –hence, in particular, of general relativity too– as it concerns the way the

inherent in that theory (diﬀerential) “Calculus” is supplied, to cope with problems of

the quantum theory. Indeed, we can further say that, looking at the same classical

(: “newtonian) manner of deﬁnition of the “derivative”,

Einstein was demanding, within that framework, to abandon, even the

(3.2)

notion of continuity(!)

in physics, having thus, instead, to invent a

“purely algebraic physics” (loc. cit., p. 285); therefore, in particular, as,

of course, we can say, a (purely) algebraic analysis(!), as well.

In this connection, we can certainly refer here, as already done in the preceding,

to the relevant remarks thereof of R.P. Feynman [7: p. 166]. as well as, to those

of C.J. Isham [9: p. 393] (in this regard, see also e.g. A. Mallios [16]), concerning,

namely, the ineﬀectiveness of
the classical diﬀerential geometry, accordingly, of
that one of a smooth (: C∞-)manifold too, within the quantum r´egime (yet, see (2.3)
in the foregoing, along with our discussion in the subsequent Section 4).

On the other hand, the pertinence, in that context, of ADG to confronting with

problems of quantum gravity still lies in its algebraic (viz. “leibnizian”, so to say)

character :

Indeed, the whole ediﬁce of ADG is, by its very construction, sheaf-

theoretic, sheaf theory being, of course, of an algebraic nature (see, for instance,

H. Grauert–R. Remmert [9: p. VII]). Thus, ADG might also be construed, as an

Geometry and Physics of Today

17

algebraic (: “leibnizian”) manner of presenting the fundamentals of the

classical diﬀerential geometry, while, at the same time, still getting, as

an outstanding outcome (see, for example, (2.22), as well as, (2.1) in the

(3.3)

preceding), the possibility of working, without any resort to a background

“space”, in the classical sense of the latter term, as for instance, to

a “space-time continuum”(!), as it happens, instead, in the standard

theory.

Certainly, the signiﬁcance of the aforementioned two issues of ADG cannot be

underestimated, while the same might be, in eﬀect, quite well, what A. Einstein

himself, by 1935 already, was looking for (see, for instance, still, J. Stachel [33: p.

285], as above).

4. Particular potential applications of ADG in the quantum r´egime.−

We start, by presenting, within the framework of ADG, the relevant theory of Elem´er

E. Rosinger, pertaining to “generalized functions”, whose algebra (sheaf ), in partic-

ular, the “foamy” one, can be used, as a “sheaf of coeﬃcients”, deﬁning thus, ap-

propriately, a corresponding herewith “diﬀerential triad”, basic ingredient to having

a set-up in developing the mechanism of ADG (see (2.19) in the foregoing). For

similar previous accounts, see also A. Mallios–E.E. Rosinger [22], [23], as well as,

A. Mallios [17: Chapt. IX; Section 5].

However, before we come to the relevant exposition, it is still to be noticed,

herewith, a fact of a particular signiﬁcance, referring to the very structure of ADG

(cf. (4.1) below, along with Subsection 4.(b) in the sequel), as it concerns two impo-

rtant special cases of the general theory of ADG, we are going to consider, by the

subsequent discussion; the same are also characteristic of the way, one may have

a “diﬀerential-geometric mechanism”, in the sense of ADG, diﬀerent, in character,

from the classical manner of obtaining it (viz., via smooth manifolds, but, see also

(4.1), along with (4.11) below). So it is, indeed quite useful (yet, rather, necessary(!))

to make the following remarks. That is,

18

Anastasios Mallios

even, if we take, as the base space of the sheaves involved, within the

abstract context of ADG, a (smooth) manifold X, in the standard sense

of this term (cf. thus the ensuing two Subsections below), its rˆole (: as

(4.1)

the source of Calculus) is actually transferred now to the “sheaf of co-

eﬃcients”, A. Yet, this is very organic, since it is essentially we(!), who

make the calculations/experiments, based on our own “arithmetics”,

viz. for the case in hand, again, via the algebra sheaf A.

Therefore,

the manifold X, as in (3.1) above, is just viewed, simply, as a particular

topological space, being, of course, by its very deﬁnition, paracompact

(Hausdorﬀ ); the latter condition is certainly, otherwise, very useful,

indeed, when referring to cohomological

issues: sheaf cohomology is,

(4.2)

for that matter, apart from sheaf theory itself, the other fundamental

ingredient of ADG. Yet, it may still happen that the topology of X be

chosen quite diﬀerent from the initial, viz. the standard topology of the

manifold X, i.e., the “locally euclidean” one); see, for instance, “Sorkin’s

topology” in Subsection 4.(b) below.

However, as we shall see, by the ensuing discussion, the particular cases we look at

in the sequel, do have, so to say, a

(4.3)

newtonian spark (!),

that is, something of a “starting point”, that will become better clear, by the sub-

sequent rationale. Notwithstanding, as we shall also realize, in that context,

this does not aﬀect, at all(!), the “leibnizian” character of the mechanism

(4.4)

of ADG,

of the general theory.

as the latter is inherently aﬀorded, by the same two particular subsequent examples

The preceding certainly constitutes a fundamental special issue of paramount

importance, indeed, for potential applications; the same could still be worthwhile

to be viewed axiomatically(!), as well, contributing thus to our knowledge, as it

Geometry and Physics of Today

19

concerns the whole character of the general theory.

In this regard, see also our

previous account thereof, already in A. Mallios [17: Chapter IX; Section 5].

Note 4.1.− By still referring to our previous issue in (4.3), as we shall

see, by the ensuing examples the so-called therein “newtonian spark”

not only supplies the “structure sheaf ” A, by the “spark” (fuse) of its

“diﬀerential” mechanism, but what is, in eﬀect, herewith of a partic-

ular importance, is that one assures, in that context, the validity of

Poincar´e Lemma, indeed, of an extraordinary importance of the whole

mechanism of ADG. Thus, one can complete (4.3), by actually setting

the equivalence;

(4.5)

“newtonian spark” ⇐⇒ Poincar´e Lemma.

So here again one realizes the ﬁtness of

(4.6)

by cohomological issues.

replacing of the “geometric character”, locally(!), of classical analysis,

However, more on this we shall see in the pertinent places below.

Thus, we come now to examine our ﬁrst Example, pertaining to the situation

described by (4.3), (4.5) above, straightforwardly, by the ensuing Subsection:

4.(a). Rosinger’s algebra sheaf.− Here the aforementioned already “new-

tonian spark”, as in (4.3) above, is nothing more, as we shall presently see, right

below, than the classical

(4.7)

an abstract,

(4.8)

“dx”

“∂”

of the standard theory of C∞-manifolds. Thus, the above classical “dx” is, for the
case at issue, prolonged, true, it is, in point of fact, “promoted”(!), so to speak, to

in the sense of ADG (see, for instance, (2.14) in the preceding), deﬁned now on an
algebra sheaf (Rosinger’s), containing the standard one C∞
X , viz. the C-algebra sheaf
(of germs of C-valued smooth functions [R-valued functions could also be considered,

20

Anastasios Mallios

of course]) on a given manifold X. Indeed, we can still say, in anticipation, that

Rosinger’s algebra sheaf And, and, i n e x t e n s o Af oam (see (4.20), (4.21) in the
sequel) contain much more than C∞
X of the classical theory (cf. thus (4.14) below).
We depict the above, by the following diagram, whose notation will become more

clear, through the ensuing discussion. Thus, we have;

(4.9)

C∞
X

❄
And

nd ≡ Ω1

We proceed, by explaining the notation applied in (4.9); thus,

(4.10)

And ≡ A,

stands therein for Rosinger’s algebra sheaf a C-algebra sheaf on X, the latter space
being, by assumption, an open subset of Rk. However, since the whole theory is, in
point of fact, of a local nature, one may consider, instead, Rk just locally, that is, we
can assume that X is a smooth (: C∞-)manifold. Notwithstanding, for simplicity’s
sake, we adopt, throughout, that

(4.11)

X is open in Rk.

Accordingly, X being, by its very deﬁnition, a metrizable space, one concludes, in

particular, that

(4.12)

X is a paracompact Hausdorﬀ (topological) space.

See, for instance, J. Dugundji [6: p. 186, Theorem 5.3].

Now, Rosinger’s algebra sheaf A ≡ And, as in (4.10) above, is actually an ap-

propriate (cf. (4.13) in the sequel) quotient of a functional (algebra) sheaf : thus,

technically speaking, it is deﬁned, as a quotient of a functional (algebra) presheaf,

the latter being proved, in particular, to be a “complete” one, therefore (J. Leray), a

Geometry and Physics of Today

21

sheaf. Yet, the corresponding, in that context, quotient algebras are deﬁned, modulo

a suitable (2-sided) ideal (: “Rosinger’s ideal”), which is essentially characterized, by

what we may consider, as “Rosinger’s asymptotic vanishing condition”; in particular,

the latter is deﬁned, via a

closed nowhere dense (hence, the subindex “nd”, appeared in (4.10)) sub-

set Γ of X, the same ideal consisting thus of those functions/elemenets

(4.13)

of the (local section) algebras concerned, that vanish “eventually” (w.r.t.

a parameter involved, a natural number, index) on any relatively com-

pact subset of the complement of Γ .

Concerning the precise deﬁnition of the preceding, we refer to A. Mallios [17: Chapt.

IX; Section 5], or even (: to A. Mallios-E.E. Rosinger [22: p. 236; (2.2)]. Yet, by

further looking at the same sheaf (4.10), as above, and also complementing the

information we have through (4.9), we still note that we actually get, by the very

deﬁnition of (4.10) (cf., for instance, E.E. Rosinger [29: p. 8; (1.2.15), (1.2.16), along

with p. 367, (2)]),

(4.14)

X & D′
C∞

X ⊆ A ≡ And.

Here the middle term in (4.14) denotes the sheaf (of germs) of Schwartz distributions

on X, viewed, as a C-vector space sheaf on X (loc. cit., (5.19)).

On the other hand, the “basic diﬀerential operator”

(4.15)

∂ : A −→ Ω1,

that one has to deﬁne, according to the general theory of ADG, see, for instance,

(2.14) in the preceding, or even in A. Mallios [13: Chapt. VI; Section 1], is here

provided by the presence of the ﬁrst member in (4.14), that is, locally, by that one

of a (C-)algebra of the form

(4.16)

C∞(U ), with U open in X ⊆ Rk,

(see also (4.11)), that virtually constitutes, within the present context, the “newto-

nian spark”, hinted at in (4.3). Thus, the basic diﬀerential ∂, as in (4.15), in now

deﬁned coordinate-wise, along the classical patterns, since the basic constituents of

22

Anastasios Mallios

the Rosinger’s algebra (pre)sheaf are (local sections of) cartesian product algebras

of the form,

(4.17)

(C∞(U ))

N,

with U , as in (4.16), which then are “quotiented”, according to (4.11). Of course,

the previously coordinate-wise (classically!) deﬁned diﬀerential passes to the quo-

tient. For technical details see A. Mallios [17: Chapt. IX; Subsection 5.(b)], or even

to A. Mallios-E.E. Rosinger [22]. Thus, the overall moral, that is here, concluded

according to the general principles of ADG, is the following;

Starting from any basic “diﬀerential triad”, in the sense of ADG (even

a classical one, as e.g. a “locally euclidean one, this is the case, here-

(4.18)

with, we can then perform any (functorial) operation, provided within

the category of diﬀerential triads, to get thus at a new one [occasionally,

more useful/ﬂexible than the initially given one!].

Thus, by referring, in particular, to Rosinger’s algebra sheaf, as above, and the

associated with it diﬀerential triad, we remark that, in view of (4.18), what we

actually consider, in that context, is:

i) to take a denumerable cartesian product of the standard (: newtonian-cartesian)

diﬀerential triad

(4.19)

as well as,

(C∞

X , d, Ω1),

ii) to take, in particular, a pertinent quotient of the above, modulo Rosinger’s

ideal, as indicated by (4.13).

In this connection, the aforesaid categorical treatment of ADG, has been occa-

sionally considered already in A. Mallios [13: Chapt. VI; Sections 5, 6], as well as,

in [17: Chapt. I; Section 5.(e), 5.(f): “pull-back” functor]; yet, an analogous fuller

and systematic categorical study of diﬀerential triads has been recently supplied by

the relevant work of M. Papatriantaﬁllou [25], [26], [27].

On the other hand, one gets at an immense generalization of the above, by

considering, in place of And, what we may call a Rosinger’s multi-foam algebra

Geometry and Physics of Today

23

sheaf, along with the associated diﬀerential triad,

(4.20)

(BΛ,J , ∂, Ω1);

here the space X, base of the sheaves concerned, is still given by (4.11), while the

sheaf on X appeared in the ﬁrst member of (4.20) is again a pertinent quotient of

the (C-)algebra

(4.21)

C∞(X)Λ,

with Λ an upwards directed set, modulo an analogously deﬁned (2-sided) ideal of

the same algebra, with respect to a given (upwards) directed family J of “residual”
subsets of X, the “singularity-sets” of X (viz. those A ⊆ X, with ∁A = X), the
applied terminology, herewith, being hinted at potential physical applications: See

A. Mallios-E.E. Rosinger [23], as well as, A. Mallios [17: Chapt.

IX; Section 6].

Of course, the singularity-sets, as above, generalize the notion of nowhere dense

sets, considered by (4.13) in the preceding. Hence, the increase of the types of

“singularities”, one can cope with, in the framework of ADG, as explained in the

foregoing.

Now, the same moral, that dominates our previous comments in (4.18), is, in

point of fact, as we shall presently see in the sequel, the prevalent point of view

also in the ensuing example, referring to another potential application of the very

technique of ADG in problems of quantum gravity.

4.(b). Finitary incidence algebra sheaves.− Similarly to the preceding

Example 4.(a), here too, as already said, for that matter, one starts again from a
smooth (: C∞-)manifold X, that still, for simplicity’s sake, we assume that it is just
an open subset of the euclidean space Rk (see (4.11)). However, as we shall see, this
important (: very restrictive(!), otherwise) hypothesis will ﬁnally be used, only(!) in

connection with (4.5)(!), as that was the case in the foregoing, as well: Thus,

no “global use/presence” of the euclidean or even locally euclidean space

(4.22)

is made, at all(!).

This important fact, indeed, ensures actually, the associated method, as it concerns,

at least, its diﬀerential-geometric nature, its potential versatility.

24

Anastasios Mallios

Now, following R. Sorkin [32], one chooses the locally ﬁnite open coverings of X

(recall that the latter space is here also paracompact Hausdorﬀ, see e.g. (4.12) in

the preceding), while one further considers on the set X the topology generated by

such locally ﬁnite open coverings of X, as above. In this connection we also recall,

for occasional use, in relation with ADG, that;

the local frames of a given vector sheaf on a paracompact (Hausdorﬀ)

(4.23)

space X constitute a coﬁnal subset of the locally ﬁnite open coverings

of X.

See [VS: Chapt. IV; p. 325, (8.42), along with Chapt. II: p. 127; (4.9)].

Now, the previous topological spaces, that are associated with locally ﬁnite open

coverings of X, are further endowed, `a la Sorkin (loc. cit.), with appropriate partial

orders, becoming thus “posets”, alias, “ﬁntoposets”, in the terminology of I. Raptis

[28] (see also A. Mallios-I. Raptis [29]). On the other hand, these toposets are further

suitably associated with certain ﬁnite-dimensional associative (non-abelian) linear

C-algebras, the so-called “incidence Rota algebras” (loc. cit.). The same algebras
are further sheaﬁﬁed, the resulting sheaves leading ﬁnally to appropriate “diﬀerential

triads”, in the sense, of course, that this notion is used by ADG (see [VS: Vol. II]).

Here again, as it also was the case in our previous example in Subsection 4.(a) above,

it is of a crucial signiﬁcance the

possibility of using the item connected with what we have called in the

(4.24)

preceding, “newtonian spark” (cf. thus (4.5)).

As it was pointed out therein, the latter issue is the “source” of the “diﬀerential

mechanism”, that one is supplied with, yet within the present context too,

without employing, in eﬀect, the euclidean, or even locally euclidean

(4.25)

nature of the origin of that particular “spark”, in the way, at least, we

are used to do it in the classical theory, thus far!

However, for the technical details thereof, we refer to the relevant work of A. Mallios-

I. Raptis [20], along with that one of the same authors in [21]. We have thus herewith

still another realization of the fact, being, in point of fact, a fundamental moral of

ADG (see also A. Mallios [14]), that;

Geometry and Physics of Today

25

when we try to apply (diﬀerential) geometrical methods, more so in the

quantum deep, it seems more natural to apply an analytic (: algebraic)

(4.26)

way (with symbols –recall here, for instance, “Feynman diagrams”– viz.

a “Leibnizian” manner of looking at the things, in focus), not that one

of the standard theory (: “spatial-newtonian”).

Yet, what actually leads to the same thing,

it is quite natural to try to concoct, at each particular case, under consi-

(4.27)

deration, the appropriate “diﬀerential geometric”-machinery (viz. “dif-

ferential triad”), to cope with the problem at issue.

In toto, we could also mention herewith, a basic moral of ADG, in what actually

concerns Quantum Field Theory. That is,

(4.28)

we should not relate any (quantum) ﬁeld theory with the existence of an

a d h o c given “continuum” (: “space-time manifold”, whatsoever); this,

of course, to the extent, at least, that we wish to apply therein (classi-

cal) diﬀerential geometry (CDG), since, in that context, the preponder-

ant and really instrumental issue is, in eﬀect, the relevant (diﬀerential-

geometric) technique and not(!) the underlying space.

So, in other words, it is important to aﬀord, in that context, a “diﬀerential-geometric”

machinery, irrespective of the way the latter might have been displayed (cf., for

instance, the preceding two examples), while, in any case, this particular way, “spa-

tial”, or not (loc. cit.), should not intervene in the whole process, this being especially

signiﬁcant, when referred to the quantum r´egime (see also the relevant comments

already in (1.19) in the preceding).

Indeed, in this regard, we can still remark that,

as it concerns the “inﬁnitely small” (Feynman), the (diﬀerential) “ge-

ometry”, in the way, at least, that we use to look at it (viz.

in the

(4.29)

“newtonian-cartesian” one), is no more valid(!), since the same –namely,

the “geometry” becomes –in point of fact, appears to us –in that deep,

more “physical”(!), as it always is, for that matter, viz. “relational”

(: algebraic-analytic)!

26

Anastasios Mallios

Exactly at this point, we might also recall the quite relevant remarks here of D.R. Fin-

kelstein [8: p. 155], in that (emphasis below is ours);

“Physics was dominated by the Cartesian epistemology untill the quan-

(4.30)

tum theory.”

Relate the above with our previous considerations in Scholium 2.1 in the preceding.

Yet, as a further illumination of the point of view of the whole formalism of ADG,

we have to point out/clarify, herewith, once more, two fundamental issues of the

aforesaid perspective, that also provide a potential outstanding application of the

above formalism to ever present problems, thus far, of quantum gravity. That is, we

have to note, in that context, that:

i) One can employ ADG, as a (diﬀerential) “geometry”, in the classical sense

of the latter term, even in the quantum deep(!), provided, of course we accept the

following correspondence/“identiﬁcation” (: axiomatic),

(4.31)

ﬁelds ←→ vector sheaves,

that is, in other words what we have already called elsewhere “Selesnick’s corre-

spondence” (see, for instance, A. Mallios [17: Chapt. II], for a detailed account of

this subject matter).

ii) The same “geometry”, as above (viz. always, within the framework of ADG),

can still be construed, as a “dynamical variable”, as well (see (2.6), in conjunction

with (2.13), as well as, with (2.12)).

On the other hand, another technical issue, that should also be pointed out in

this regard, is that, it, very likely, seems that;

there is no actually need to

(4.32.1)

“quantize analysis”,

(4.32)

as it concerns, in particular, its topological-linear character (this being

the source of the Calculus), since the inherent/deeper nature of the same

(: of the “analysis”), namely, the “algebraic”, or even the, so to say,

“leibnizian” one, is already, viz., by its very deﬁnition, “quantized”!

Yet, by further commenting on our last claim, as above, we still note that;

Geometry and Physics of Today

27

there is no, in eﬀect, according to the same deﬁnitions, any “inﬁnite” in

(4.33)

(pure) algebra!

So it is, therefore, in “geometry”/topology (viz.

in the so-called, “inﬁnite”(!), a

consequence, in fact, of the latter perspective), that we are, actually, entangled,

when confronting with the quantum deep (: “small distances”). Consequently, our

systematic endeavor, up to this day, in one way or another, to succeed in getting an

appropriate “algebraization” of the whole scenario!

5. Scholium (: more on the “newtonian spark”).− We usually curve a linear

structure, by “localizing” it (manifolds); in point of fact, this is a quite general device,

referring, irrespective of the dimension (ﬁnite or inﬁnite), to the (topological) vector

space-model of our (cartesian) “geometry”. In the case of Analysis, an extraordinary

issue, in that context, is that the classical Calculus that traditionally was hospitalized

in (even, emanated from) topological vector space-structures (: euclidean spaces)

still survived after this transport, a sine qua non, of course, of the justiﬁcation, for

that matter, of the previous movement, suggested, indeed, by particular important

applications. Notwithstanding, a fundamental moral of the whole issue of ADG is

that;

the real corner-stone of the previous total enterprize is, in eﬀect, what we

have already called in the foregoing, the “newtonian spark”, in that con-

(5.1)

text, a fact that might also be paralleled with the famous archimedean

demand, for a pedestal (: “∆´oς µo´ι π ˜α στ ˜ω κα´ι τ ´αν γ ˜αν κιν ´ησω—“give

me somewhere to stand and I shall move the earth”).

That is, in other words, following now Leibniz, in what actually concerns (classical)

diﬀerential geometry (CDG), what one virtually needs is to provide (according to

ADG) the appropriate, concerning the particular problem, at issue, “diﬀerential-

geometric mechanism”(!).

Furthermore, what is here of a particular signiﬁcance, having also important

potential applications (even, very likely(!), in quantum gravity too), is that:

Anastasios Mallios

28

(5.2)

the aforesaid “diﬀerential-geometric mechanism”, in the sense of ADG,

does not actually depend, at all(!), on any space, as it was the case, so

far, for the classical theory (CDG), the same mechanism referred now

directly to the (“geometric”) objects, that live on the “space”.

Indeed, the latter issue in the above remarks, as in (5.2), is, most likely, what already

Leibniz, at his time, was looking for! (See, for instance, N. Bourbaki [4: Chapt. I;

Note historique, p. 161, ft. 1], or even A. Mallios [14: (2.1), along with comments

following it]).

Thus, by further commenting on (5.2), we can still say, based also on our previous

considerations in A. Mallios [15], that;

What one actually perceives appears to be the “sheaﬁﬁcation” of a “local

aspect/information” pertaining to the particular subject matter in focus.

Besides,

(5.3)

the way we get a “local information”, may, in principle, be en-

tirely diﬀerent, in character, from the mechanism (: inherent

(5.3.1)

law–“physical”/relational procedure), which governs (hence,

the manner too, we should essentially employ the aforesaid

“sheaﬁﬁcation”, viz. the global aspect of ) that local informa-

tion.

The above explains too what one essentially encounters, in connection with what we

have called in the preceding “newtonian spark”.

Now, the replacement of a “ﬁeld”

(cf.

(2.15)), by its corresponding “Heisenberg (: “matrix”) picture”, viz. by the

(5.4)

“ﬁeld”

(5.5)

(E, D)

(EndE, DEndE ),

(see A. Mallios [14: (9.20)], along with A. Mallios [17: Chapt. VII; (5.8), (5.11)]),

hence, via its “principal sheaf ” version,

(5.6)

(AutE, DEndE |AutE ),

Geometry and Physics of Today

29

as well, may still be viewed, as being in accord with the “impossibility of having a

“relativistic quantum ﬁeld”, deﬁned at a point”(!); see, for instance, N.N. Bogolubov

et al. [4: p. 282, §10.4, p. 283, Theorem (Wightman) 10.6].

On the other hand, (5.3.1), as above, might also be construed, as another ef-

fectuation of the classical “local commutativity”, or “microscopic causality” “micro-

causality” yet, “principle of relativistic microcausality”, or even “Einstein’s locality”.

On the other hand, by further meditating, a bit more, on our previous scholium

in (5.3.1), we can actually reformulate it, as well, by remarking, in particular, that:

(5.7)

the deeper (algebraic) mechanism that might be inherent in (: esoteric

of ) a given local information (alias, of given local data), may, in general,

be, quite well, independent of the way, one has drawn this information

(: the local data, concerned).

Yet, in connection with the above remarks in (5.7) and our issue in (4.3), one may

recall, in this regard, Wittgenstein’s motto [37: p. 74; 6.54], in that;

(5.8)

“... [one must]... throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.”

Now, as a fundamental spinoﬀ of the above, one can still conceive, for instance, in

that context, the classical (Machian) perspective of an

(5.9)

“action at a distance”(!).

6. Concluding remarks (the “continuum”)− The purpose of this ﬁnal sec-

tion is to make clear, once more, that:

the notion of the “continuum”, as a “foundational element” is not ac-

(6.1)

tually the case, when physically speaking, at least (!) (and not only (!),

see e.g. (6.5) in the sequel).

Now, the inverted commas put on the word continuum, as above, refer, of course, to

the way we usually understand that notion in the familiar terminology of the classical

theory, where, in point of fact, we wish to ascribe to it a physical substance, that is,

equivalently, to endow it with a physical meaning. And just hear one has the crux

of the problem: That is,

30

Anastasios Mallios

we are actually inﬂuenced by our mathematical terminology–conception,

(6.2)

in what virtually concerns the word “continuum”, i.e., the “cartesian”,

in point of fact, perspective of the so-called “space-time”.

Thus, in other words, we make the following identiﬁcations:

(6.3)

“physical space” ←→ mathematical “space”/“continuum”, viz. some Rn,
as a (ﬁnite dimensional) topological vector space.

However,

it is exactly the above identiﬁcations, that is really the source of the

problems: Indeed, as we have already remarked in other places (cf., for instance,

A. Mallios [14: (1.4), or even (3.1)]),

“physical space” is what virtually constitutes it, that is, in other words,

(6.4)

what we may call, `a la Leibniz, the “geometrical objects” themselves,

that make up, what in eﬀect, we perceive, as “space”, in the large, as

well as, in the small.

Therefore, in that respect, the substance of the “physical space”, as above, is thus

discrete/granular, hence not at all corresponding to something “continuous”, viz.

not-discrete, when physically/conceptually speaking. On the other hand, when

mathematically speaking, a set is already, by its very deﬁnition, being thus “point-

wise determined”, absolutely “discrete”, in character!

Thus, by referring to the mathematical notion of the “continuum”, as an Rn,

n ∈ N,

(6.5)

we note that the so-called “continuum” is, technically speaking, viz. as
a mathematical term, our own deﬁnition of an Rn (n ∈ N), as already
said, viewed herewith not just, as a discrete set, as it actually is, for

that matter, but now, as a topological (vector ) space, this particular
(mathematical) “structure” on (the set) Rn being also the source of the
(newtonian) Calculus!

In this connection, we are thus inﬂuenced, by our own mathematical experience of the

concept of the “continuum”, in the way we deﬁned it, as above, that is, as a particular

ﬁnite dimensional (Hausdorﬀ ) topological vector space, a point of view that we also

attribute, in turn, to what we actually perceive, as a “physical space”, this being

further construed, as another “continuum”, this time, however, as a physical one (!),

Geometry and Physics of Today

31

based rather on a “dynamically/kinematiccaly” ascribed description of the (physical)

world; alas, something here in complete conﬂict with our actual (: experimental)

experience, as it virtually concerns, at least, the quantum r´egime (see also, for

instance, (4.30) in the preceding).

Now, in this context, the previous items;

“dynamical-kinematical description” of the (physical) world, diﬀerential

(6.6)

equations-theoretic point of view, Calculus, and “space-time continuum”

are, in eﬀect, intimately related and, in point of fact, tautosemous, in

substance.

Strictly speaking, as a matter of fact,

Calculus is the source/cause of the ﬁrst two items, as above, while,

in turn, the same (Calculus) is the spin-oﬀ, as already said, of the

(6.7)

newtonian-cartesian, so far, deﬁnition of the “space”, that is, of the

so-called “geometrical” perception of it, yet, the outcome of the same
“space-time continuum”≡ Rn (cf. (6.5)).

On the other hand, the above diﬀerential part of the Calculus, viz. “diﬀerentiation of

functions”, in principle, presupposes “good(– (: smooth) diﬀerentiable)–functions”,

something that essentially depends on the “local behavior” of the functions con-

cerned; hence, a fact that directly refers to the local nature of the domain of def-

inition of the same functions, that is, to the local structure (: “geometry”) of the
“euclidean space”, Rn, itself. Consequently,

(6.8)

we are actually entangled with the way the diﬀerential calculus

(: “diﬀerentiation”, as a mechanism) is supplied (cf. (6.5)), therefore,

the type of the “diﬀerentiable” functions that are thereby involved, or,

in other words, that are “locally” deﬁned on that particular “space”

(extremely important, as well as, eﬀective (!), anyhow, concerning the

classical theory).

However, the applications of the same diﬀerential calculus, as above, in the domain

of (classical) diﬀerential geometry, as a means of study (: working instrument) in that

particular discipline, namely, that what we have already considered in the preceding,

a “diﬀerential-geometric machinery”, yet, in other words, a “geometrical calculus”,

32

Anastasios Mallios

`a la Leibniz (see 1.17)), refers, in point of fact, to the very “geometrical objects”

(Leibniz, loc. cit.), the same being actually (Leibniz, ibid., Riemann, see [14: (1.3)])

independent of any “space”, in the sense, at least, of (6.5), as above!

On the other hand, it is reasonable to think that,

(6.9)

the very character of what we may call

“physical space” (see also (1.1)) is, in principle, the same, both

(6.9.1)

in the large, as well as, in the small.

We are thus led to a dissonance, by applying our usual classical re-
presentation of the physical space (in the large), as an Rn, irrespective,
of course, of the tremendous success, thus far, of the latter perspective,

when realizing, on the other hand (see also, for instance, (2.2), as well as,

(4.30) in the preceding), that the same (physical) “space” is virtually

quite diﬀerent from what we are confronted with, when looking at the

quantum r´egime, as it concerns the aforesaid classical perspective; see

also A. Mallios [14: (8.10), along with (8.11)].

Consequently, the appeared inconveniences (: “singularities”), regarding, of course,

applications of classical diﬀerential geometry, as a means of study, in that context,

of the physical space/geometry” in the small, that is, to say, physical laws/“ﬁelds”

(see also loc. cit., (3.21.1)) at the “quantum resolution”.

Thus, the “physical space”, as a whole, yet, according to recent advances in

theoretical physics, concerning, in particular, the quantum deep, does not seem to be

the usual “space-time” manifold, in the sense of the classical diﬀerential geometry–
theory of smooth (: C∞-)manifolds. Indeed, it appears that we have therein,

something foamy, very singular, or even something like what we may

call, a “singularity manifold”, to refer, in that respect, to a rather recent

(6.10)

utterance of R. Penrose, pertaining to a “true theory of quantumgravity”,

by replacing the “present concept of spacetime at a singularity”. (See

also, for instance, A. Mallios [14:

(10.8), along with the subsequent

discussion therein]).

Thus, concerning the “inﬁnitely small”, or else “quantum resolution”,

Geometry and Physics of Today

33

the “geometry”, in the way we usually look at it (viz. in the “newtonian-

cartesian” manner), is no more valid (!), in that context, since, at that

deep, the same becomes thus, even to our senses (!), more “physical”, as,

(6.11)

in point of fact, it always is, for that matter (see also (1.1) in the pre-

ceding, along with (6.9) above), viz. “relational” (: algebraic-analytic);

the latter aspect is still a fundamental issue, in eﬀect, of our experience,

thus far, from ADG, as well!

Indeed, as already advocated in several places in the preceding, working within the

context of ADG, we are able to look at fundamental concepts of physics, as, for in-

stance, particles/ﬁelds (see also A. Mallios [16: (3.2)]) etc, without being compelled

to stick to such “technical” notions, as e.g. “space-time” (!). In this regard, see also,

for instance, (1.8) in the preceding, yet, loc. cit. (1.6).

Yet, in this connection, we are thus very likely, led to conclude that the entangle-

ment of the “manifold” perspective in nowadays physics, especially, in the quantum

domain, is to be attributed, in eﬀect, to the relation of the former with the notion

of “diﬀerential”; indeed, the latter is the main function, that is actually applied in

our relevant rationale, in that context, while ﬁnally, as an upshot of the classical

theory (: diﬀerential geometry), we are usually of the opinion that the same manifold

concept is thus the unique(!) source of the notion of a “derivative”, covariant or

not! Therefore, the signiﬁcance, hereupon of the new proposal, as this is, provided,

by ADG: That is, once more, we realize that

to have a connection, we do not actually need a “manifold”, even

if we momentarily borrow from such a concept the “inﬁnitesimal

(: “newtonian”) spark ! The latter constitutes, in point of fact, the cen-

tral moral of the entire study of ADG.

Thus, by looking at the standard question (cf., for instance, R.W. Sharpe [30: p. 2,

(6.12)

ft. 2]),

(6.13)

“what geometry on a manifold supports physics?”,

we can combine it now with the fundamental moral of ADG (see e.g. (6.12), as

above, along with A. Mallios [14: (1.2), (3.21.2)]), that, in point of fact,

34

Anastasios Mallios

(6.14)

diﬀerential geometry means, in eﬀect, connection.

Consequently, blending the previous two aspects, as in (6.13) and (6.14), we are thus

led to a response to (6.13), in the sense of aﬀording a pertinent choice of “A”, more

precisely speaking, the associated with it “diﬀerential triad” and the concomitant

“diﬀerential-geometric mechanism”, `a la ADG, suitable to the particular problem

at issue; see thus, for instance, Subsections 4. (a), 4. (b) in the preceding, along

with A. Mallios [12: p. 174; concluding remarks]. In this regard, see also the latest

relevant account in A. Mallios–I. Raptis [21].

6.(a). ADG vis-`a-vis a Uniﬁed Field Theory.− The quite ambitious(!) ti-

tle of the present Subsection is rooted, in point of fact, on our previous comments in

(6.9.1) and on the very essence of the point of view of the same Abstract Diﬀerential

Geometry (ADG), as the latter can be applied, in that context, in conjunction, for

instance, with Rosinger’s theory of “generalized functions”: The technical part of

the aforesaid scheme, hinted at herewith, has been already expounded in A. Mallios-

E.E. Rosinger [22], [23]; in this connection, see also our previous discussion in Sub-

section 4.(a) in the foregoing, along with A. Mallios [16: (5.20), (5.21)], as well as,

[14: Sections 6, 8; see, in particular, (8.8) therein, or even (8.11), yet, Section 10].

Moreover, cf. also A. Mallios [17: Chapt. IX; Sections 5, 6, along with Section 10

therein, see e.g. (10.29)].

Now, as already said, the preceding just hint at a potential confrontation with

the second issue in the title of this Subsection, through the machinery of ADG,

that is, to say, in terms of the techniques of the classical diﬀerential geometry, be-

ing, however, freed now from the ever disturbing/pestilential “singularities”, and

the like, of the classical approach to the problem at issue. Of course, this is due

here, as already explained, throughout the preceding, to the absence, according to

ADG, of any supporting “space”, that would also exclusively supply (: generate) the

“diﬀerential-geometric” machinery employed, in that context (see the relevant cita-

tions, as before), a situation inherent, in eﬀect, in the classical theory (CDG; cf. the

previous Section 5, along with the concluding remarks above, preceding the present

Subsection).

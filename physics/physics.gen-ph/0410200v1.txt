KEYWORDS: Neutrino, Cold Electron, Interaction

Abstract

We show that neutrinos and electrons share the same theoreti-
cal structure, and satisfy parallel relations particularly of the Large
Number kind. We then argue that the neutrino can be described as
a “cold” electron in a sense that is detailed, and thereby the weak
interactions are indeed a weak form of electromagnetism.

1 Introduction

Some years ago the author’s work successfully predicted a dark energy driven
accelerating universe with a small cosmological constant, as also a small mass
for the neutrino, about a hundred millionth that of the electron [1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6]. These results were subsequently conﬁrmed by the observations of Perl-
mutter and co-workers and other teams [7, 8], while the Superkamiokande ex-
periments also conﬁrmed the mass of the neutrino, with the predicted value.
The cosmological model referred to uses ﬂuctuations in particle numbers and
deduced moreover otherwise empirically well known supposedly mysterious,
inexplicable coincidences– the so called Large Number Relations and the

1

Weinberg formula [9]. The mass of the neutrino was based on its anomalous
behavior (Cf. also [10]), and was also deduced, again on the basis of ﬂuctu-
ations. In this scheme, given N particles, √N particles condense out of the
background dark energy or Quantum Vaccuum as a result of ﬂuctuations. In
this theoretical model we deduce that the gravitational constant is given by

In the sequel l, m denote the Compton length and mass of a typical elemen-
tary particle like the pion. (It may be noted that in the Large Number sense,
the distinction between, for example, the pion and electron or proton masses
gets blurred.) More recently (1) was shown to be related to the universal un-
derpinning of Planck scale oscillators [11]. Incidentally, this relation explains
the longstanding puzzling empirical Weinberg formula referred to above. For,
using the so called Eddington formula

logical scheme, in (1) and further remembering that the Hubble constant H
is given by c

(3)

which is the Weinberg formula. It may be mentioned that the puzzling feature
of (3) has been that a so called microphysical parameter viz., m depends on
a cosmological parameter viz., H. However it turns out, as can be seen
from (1), that G itself has a distributional cosmological character so that,
ultimately both the left side and the right side of (3) are purely microphysical
(Cf.ref.[11] for details).

2 Neutrinos and the Weak Interaction

With the above background, we now investigate the neutrino and weak in-
teractions. We start by following Hayakawa [12] to balance the gravitational

force and the Fermi energy of the “cold” background neutrinos and further
identify it with the intrinsic energy of the neutrinos to get

mνR2 = mνc2

where mν is the neutrino mass. From (4) we can immediately deduce that
mν = 10−8me, Nν ∼

1090

(5)

Both the relations in (5) are known to be correct.
We then use the fact that due to the ﬂuctuation in the number of nutrinos,
we have an energy which is the inertial energy again:

where ¯g2 gives the weak interaction coupling constant.
Interestingly there is a similar relation for the electrons (Cf.ref.[12])

From (6) and (7) on using (5) we get

which ofcourse is again known to be correct.
We have thus recovered from theory the well known values of the weak cou-
pling constant and the neutrino mass. We would next like to show that there
is a complete parallel between the Large Number Relations for elementary
particles with similar relations for the neutrino. We start with the simplest
relation, which can be easily veriﬁed

Nνmν = Nm = M = 1055gm,

M being the Mass of the universe. We next return to the fact used above in
(4) and consider the equality of the gravitational mass of a particle due to
the remaining n particles with the inertial mass of the particle

In (9), if n is replaced by N and r is replaced by the radius of the universe,
we get the mass of an elementary particle like the pion. On the other hand
if in (9) we replace n by the number of neutrinos Nν instead of N then we
recover the mass of the neutrino. Finally if we take n = 1 and r = lP , the
Planck scale we recover the Planck mass mP , which indeed is to be expected
because as Rosen had shown, the Planck mass black hole is a universe in
itself [13].
Similarly we see the complete parallel between (6) and (7). To proceed
further we consider (1) in an alternative form viz.,

For the neutrino number and neutrino mass given in (5), (10) gives

where T is the life time of the universe (Cf. also [15]). Indeed (13) is just a
variant of the Weinberg formula, and can now be interpreted as the fact that
the gravitational self energy of the elementary particle, viz., Gm2
has a life
time of the order of the age of the universe, due to the Uncertainty Principle.
It can immediately be veriﬁed that for the neutrino we have the equation

In the author’s model, it has been shown that the pion can be considered to
be an electron positron bound state so that we have

where l is the pion Compton wavelength. Similarly one could consider the
pion to also be the bound state of a quark anti-quark in QCD so that we
have

g2
mqc2 = l
where mq is the quark mass and g2 is the strong interaction coupling constant.
There is an immediate analogue of (15) and (16) for the neutrino viz.,

(16)

Finally it may be pointed out that there is an immediate analogue of the
Weinberg formula (3) viz.,

It must be mentioned that these analogues like (6), (11), (14), (17) and (18)
between the neutrino and an elementary particle are not mere numerical co-
incidences. This is because the various relations for the elementary particles
are the result of a theoretical structure, and are not mere accidents. What
the foregoing means is that the neutrino has a similar theoretical structure.
To see this in greater detail, we note that in the case of the Planck scale
underpinning for the universe of elementary particles, as was discussed in an
earlier communication [16], we have,

which corresponds to the “cold” cosmic background temperature. This is
completely consistent with our starting point in (4), where we consider the
Fermi energy of the “cold” cosmic neutrinos. Infact the Fermi energy term
in (4) (or the temperature (22)) is the only diﬀerence between elementary
particles and neutrinos - this is what leads to diﬀerent values for mν, Nν etc.
as compared to m, N etc.

3 Discussion

We have seen that the weak interactions given by the coupling constant in
(8) is a parallel of the electromagnetic interaction. Ofcourse in the standard
electroweak theory [17] the neutrino mass is taken to be zero. However after
the Superkamiokande experiments, it has been realised that some modiﬁca-
tion in the standard model is required. We have seen above that it is the
“cold” cosmic background or equivalently the Fermi energy which gives the
neutrino its mass on the one hand and the weak interaction on the other.
Further as can be seen from (6) and (7) the origin of the weak and the elec-
tromagnetic interaction is the same viz., the ﬂuctuation in particle number
in the universe.

Indeed based on these ﬂuctuations we could even get the gravitational inter-
action, that is (1). Infact equating the ﬂuctuational energy of electromag-
netism (7) to the gravitational energy given in (9) with N replacing n and
R replacing r, we have

that is

Equation (23) is the well known relation giving the ratio of the gravitational
and electromagnetic coupling constants.
If we observe the parallel in the equations (15), (16) and (17), we can in-
terpret (17) as describing a bound state of two neutrinos. The result is a
particle of Compton wavelength lν, that is a heavy particle of mass 104m.
Such a particle would ofcourse be very shortlived. Indeed particles of this
order of mass, for example the
Finally it must be noted that the much smaller mass of the neutrino - ap-
proximately a vanishing mass - causes the four component Dirac electron
equation to split into two component neutrino equations, as in standard the-
ory, and thus gives the neutrino its handedness.
In summary we have shown that the neutrino can be described as a “cold”
(old) electron.

γ resonances are known [18].

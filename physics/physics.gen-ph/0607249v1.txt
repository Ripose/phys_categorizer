Introduction

In the paper “Algebraic quantum theory” [Pie4], noted “AQT”, a new quantum ﬁeld theory of strings was
introduced in order to endow the elementary particles with an algebraic space-time structure constituting
their own vacua from which their mass shells can be generated. This allows to ﬁnd a way out to the
inextricable problem of unifying general relativity (noted “GR”) with quantum ﬁeld theory (noted “QFT”)
in the sense that the expanding space-time of GR becomes now spreaded out discretely at the Planck scale
around “organizing centers” of the internal vacua of the elementary particles. Note that these “organizing
centres” refer to attractors from a dynamical point of view.

The mathematical foundations of AQT were rather well developed in [Pie4] and initiated in [Pie1],

[Pie2] and [Pie3]. They include essentially:

• the Langlands global program based on the (in)ﬁnite dimensional representations of the (ir)reducible
bilinear algebraic semigroups over products, right by left, of completions of a numberﬁeld of charac-
teristic 0.

• the versal deformations of degenerate singularities and their blowups [A-G-L-V].

• the algebraic representations of von Neumann bialgebras set on bilinear Hilbert spaces.

But, the connections between the structure of AQT and the main attainments of quantum (and classi-
cal) ﬁeld theories and string theories were not clearly shown up in [Pie4]: it is thus the aim of this paper
to remedy this gap while pointing out the main physical advances of this new quantum string ﬁeld theory
as for example:

• a better understanding of the physical phenomena at the elementary particle level due to the action-
reaction processes between left and right semiobjects which are generated mathematically by envis-
aging a bilinear (non commutative) framework.

• a good reason to see in the internal vacua of the elementary particles a candidate for the dark energy.

What is particularly important is to relate the two quantizations of quantum (ﬁeld) theories to the

main concepts of AQT and to show that they imply the mathematical structure of AQT.

2

In this perspective, the main concepts of relativistic quantum mechanics, (classical and) quantum ﬁeld
theories and string theories are examined in a critical way in chapter 2 so that the relevant features of these
theories could be separated in order to set up the physical foundations of a quantum theory of structure
of elementary particles.

It then appears that the two quantizations of quantum (ﬁeld) theories lead to consider the following

conceptual basis for a new quantum structure of elementary particles:

1. the ﬁrst quantization of (relativistic) quantum mechanics suggests that:

(a) a mathematical structure be given to the quanta; under the circumstances, they become alge-
braic closed irreducible real subsets characterized by a Galois extension degree equal to N .

(b) a bialgebra of operators acting on bilinear Hilbert spaces of ﬁelds be introduced as being a von

Neumann bialgebra.

2. the second quantization of QFT and its uniﬁcation with GR leads to envisage that:

(a) every elementary fermion must be viewed as an elementary bisemifermion which (see proposition

2.7):

• is localized in an open ball.

• is given by the product of a left semifermion, localized in the upper half space, and of a
right symmetric semifermion, localized in the lower half space in such a way that, under
some external perturbation, this bisemifermion could be split, generating a pair of fermion-
antifermion, of which fermion corresponds to the left semifermion and antifermion to the
right semifermion; by this way, the right semifermion ( ≈ antisemifermion), projected onto
the associated left semifermion, is hidden by the only observable (left) fermion.

• is composed of three central diagonal embedded bistructures, which are its internal struc-
tural ﬁelds, in such a way that the two most internal bistructures, labeled “ ST ” and
“ M G ”, are its internal vacuum from which its mass shell bistructure “ M ” can be
created.

(b) Each central diagonal bistructure is a (bilinear) ﬁeld, direct sum of a time ﬁeld and of a space
ﬁeld, in such a way that each ﬁeld is composed of (the sum of) the set of packets of pairs
of strings (or bistrings), behaving like harmonic oscillators and characterized by integers µ
corresponding to normal modes at µ quanta.

The string ﬁelds, included into the corresponding brane ﬁelds [Joh], are proved, in chapter 3, to
correspond to (bisemi)sheaves of C -valued diﬀerentiable bifunctions on the conjugacy class representatives
of algebraic bilinear semigroups over the real ramiﬁed completions of number ﬁelds of characteristic 0 .

Thereafter, the holomorphic and automorphic representations of these string ﬁelds are studied in the

second part of chapter 3.

Finally, in chapter 4, the consideration of von Neumann bialgebras on these (bilinear) ﬁelds allows to
deﬁne the states of the fermionic vacuum (operator valued) ﬁelds and the states of the corresponding mass
(operator valued) ﬁelds generated from versal deformations and blowups of singularities on the vacuum
ﬁelds.

In this context, it is shown how mass open bistrings can be created from the vacuum ﬁelds and

annihilated.

The paper ends with a brief survey of interacting ﬁelds, which are gravitational and electromagnetic
oﬀ-diagonal ﬁelds generated from the consideration of the completely reducible modular bilinear non-
orthogonal representation spaces of bilinear algebraic semigroups.

All developments of this paper refer to the preprint “Algebraic quantum theory” [Pie4].

From quantum ﬁeld theories to the
concept of ﬁelds in AQT

2.1 Underlying bilinearity in classical mechanics

Let X denote the manifold of positions of r material points and let M = T ∗(X) be the total space of its
cotangent bundle taking into account the positions and momenta of these points.

Classical mechanics deals with diﬀerentiable functions on M , interpreted as a phase space at r degrees
of freedom. Such a diﬀerentiable function, extensely used in classical dynamics, is the function of Lagrange
L(q1, · · · , qr; ˙q1, · · · , ˙qr, t) = T − U , where T is the kinetic energy and U is the potential energy of the
considered system.

(Classical) Dynamics starts then up with the least action principle stating that the integral

L dt
must be stationary for an inﬁnitesimally small variation of the movement between the initial state at time
t = t0 and the ﬁnal state at time t = t1 [Bro2].

R

The functions on C∞(M ) constitute the algebra of observables in classical dynamics and the points of

t1

M are in fact classical states.

A Lie algebra structure on C∞(M ) is reached by considering on M a symplectic form w =

dqj ∧dpj ,

r

j=1

where qj are local coordinates and pj are the corresponding momenta.

for the functions f and g on the algebra C∞(M ) corresponds to the symplectic form w and is a C -bilinear
operation (f, g) → {f, g} [Maz1] satisfying {f, g} = 0 and the Jacobi identity.

A general Poisson bracket operation on C∞(M ) has the form:

{f, g}(x) =

Σ
i,j=1

αi,j(x)

∂xj

where αi,j (x) is a skew-symmetric bivector ﬁeld [Maz1].

A Poisson manifold is a manifold M with Poisson brackets on C∞(M ) .

5

A dynamics, resulting from the Poisson bracket {f, H} , is obtained if the function of Hamilton

H(q1, · · · , qr, p1, · · · , pr, t) , playing the role of energy, is introduced on C∞(M ) . Indeed, let

2.2 First quantization in the wave quantum mechanics

a) The ﬁrst quantization of quantum mechanics leads to the main following change:

The “classical mechanics” algebra C∞(M ) = C∞(T ∗(X)) of observables, which are diﬀerentiable
functions (for example, L or H ) on the phase space M , is replaced by the “quantum mechanics”
algebra of operators acting on a linear Hilbert space H of states or quantum observables, this algebra
of operators being the von Neumann algebra M (H) in H .

In this context, the generalized coordinates q1, · · · , qr and p1, · · · , pr of the r material points become,
in the quantum language, operators q1, · · · , qr and p1 → ~
, respectively
according to the correspondence rule.

, . . . , pr → ~
i

∂
∂q1

∂
∂qr

i

If these r material points are immersed in a 3-dimensional space, the system has k = 3r degrees of
freedom. The operators have to obey the Heisenberg commutation relations [qj, pj] = i~ where the
Planck’s constant ~ is supposed to introduce the quantum aspect of the theory [Dir4], [Con].

Let H(q1, · · · , q3r, p1, · · · , p3r) be the Hamilton’s function of our system of r material points which
are interpreted as particles in the quantum perspective.

Quantum mechanics, following classical mechanics, tries to get from H the energy levels of the
system.

b) Matrix aspect

The procedure consists in ﬁnding a matricial representation to the operators q1, · · · , q3r, p1, · · · , p3r
in such a way that the matrix

can be reduced to a diagonal matrix.

W = H(Q1, · · · , Q3r, P1, · · · , P3r)

6

Q1, · · · , Q3r and P1, · · · , P3r are the matricial representations of q1, · · · , q3r and p1, · · · , p3r satisfying
the matrix commutation relations of Heisenberg: this is the philosophy of the theory of matrices
whose key papers can be found in [Vdw].

What is important to remark is that:

1) the rank(s) of these matrices Q1, · · · , Q3r and P1, · · · , P3r is (are) the number(s) of internal

degrees of freedom of the system(s).

2) the number of internal degrees of freedom of the system, given by H(q1, · · · , q3r, p1, · · · , p3r) ,

does generally not correspond to the dimension k = 3r of the conﬁguration space.

Given the elements hµν of the matrix H , the fundamental problem of the theory of matrices
consists in solving the eigenvalue equation [v.Neu], [B-N]:

hµν sν = Eµ sµ ,

1 ≤ µ, ν ≤ ∞ ,

Σ
µ

• the integers µ and ν label the internal degrees of freedom,

• Eµ and sµ are respectively the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors.

where:

c) Wave aspect

The other attempt of non relativistic quantum mechanics was initiated by L. de Broglie with the idea
that, since there exists for the light a corpuscular and a wave aspect related by the energy relation
E = hν , is was natural to suppose that the same duality occurred for the elementary particles to
which (periodical) waves had to be associated [Bro1].

This led him to associate to an elementary particle a wave ψ composed of a superposition of plane
waves

ψ = Σ
µ

c(pµ) ei~(Eµt−pµr)

where Eµ is the energy corresponding to the linear momentum pµ .

According to M. Born, the probability of observing an elementary particle with a linear momentum
p is given by |c(p)|2 (discrete case).

Following the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of optical geometry, L. de Broglie then proposes the evolution
equation:

H(x, y, z, px, py, pz) ψ =

~

i

∂ψ
∂t

for the propagation of the wave ψ associated with an elementary particle (in this instance, the
electron).

Schr¨odinger studied extensively the corresponding wave equation:

H(q1, · · · , q3r, p1, · · · , p3r) ψ(q1, · · · , q3r) = λψ(q1, · · · , q3r)

and showed that it was identical to the eigenvalue equation [Vdw]

introduced in b).

hµν sν = Eµ sµ

Σ
ν

7

However, the above mentioned wave equation is not separable for a system of r elementary particles
and, thus, the exact correspondence between the matrix aspect and the wave aspect of the theory
is only reached for one isolated elementary particle (or, for an elementary particle (an electron) in
the ﬁeld of a proton: the hydrogen atom studied by E. Schr¨odinger). In that case, the rank of the
matrix H(Q1, Q2, Q3, P1, P2, P3) to be diagonalized must correspond to the dimension of the basis
{ei~(Eµt−pµr)}µ in which ψ is developed.

d) Relativistic aspect

As it is well known, it is ﬁnally P.A.M. Dirac [Dir1] who succeeded in ﬁnding the well accepted
relativistic wave equation:

which was chosen to be linear in order to have a positive probability density.

2.3 Second quantization in quantum ﬁeld theory

Taking into account the diﬃculty of interpretation of the hole theory, especially in the case of charged
bosons (i.e. the mesons π± ) [Wei] and the impossibility of developing a relativistic quantum theory with
a ﬁxed number of elementary particles, it became necessary to enlarge the frame of relativistic quantum
mechanics in order to include a ﬁeld aspect into the theory [Wig].

a) Bosonic ﬁeld

1) the hamiltonian:

transformed into

This was ﬁrst realized for the radiation ﬁeld behaving like a sum of independent harmonic oscillators

coming from ¨q + w2

3) the commutation relations

[a0, a0] = [a+

4) the eigenvalue equations:

Hψµ = wµψµ

and Ha+

0 ψµ = (wµ + w0)a+

0 ψµ ,

can generate an inﬁnite set of states of higher energy (starting with a given ψµ corresponding to
the energy eigenvalue wµ ) by successive applications of the creation operator a+

0 ψµ = ψµ+1
and a set of states of lower energy by successive applications of the annihilation operator a0 :

number of quanta nµ by one unit.

This formalism, succinctly recalled for the radiation ﬁeld, refers to the Bose method which counts
the radiation states according to the number nµ of quanta in each normal mode.

More speciﬁcally, the canonical quantization procedure, applied to the free Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, yields
a many particle description in terms of numbers of quanta in such a way that an arbitrary state is
crudely given by the ﬁeld:

change of quanta in the diﬀerent normal modes according to the Bose-Einstein statistics [B-D].

b) Fermionic ﬁeld

On the other hand, the fermionic ﬁelds to be quantized were assumed to be relativistic quantum
mechanics wave functions in such a way that the informations contained in these do not tell us which
particles have which quantum numbers but how many of the indistinguishable particles are in the
various quantum modes. This results from the Pauli exclusion principle preventing the occupation
number nµ of electrons in any normal mode µ from taking values other than 0 or 1 . In this context,
the Dirac (electron) ﬁeld was written according to:

ψ(x) = Σ

is the vacuum energy operator to which corresponds the vacuum state

2.4 Gauge models of the interactions and string theory

a) The Gauge transformations are based on the observation that there corresponds a conservation
law to every continuous symmetry of the Lagrangian in such a way that a transformation on the ﬁelds
leaving the Lagrangian invariant can be constructed for every conserved quantum number [D-V].

In quantum electrodynamics, the symmetry operation is a local change of the phase of the electron
ﬁeld, a dephasage resulting from the emission or absorption of a photon.

In the non-abelian electroweak gauge theory of Weinberg-Salam-Glashow, the invariance of the in-
teractions with respect to local transformations of a leptonic equivalent of the isospin generates
four ﬁelds having null masses, which may become massive by the Higgs mechanism consisting in
introducing a new ﬁeld which doesn’t cancel in the vacuum.

So, the vacuum plays an important and complex role in the non-abelian gauge theories where the
vacuum state breaks the symmetries obeyed by the equations in order to generate non-vanishing
masses while, in quantum electrodynamics, the vacuum state is the zero-particle state.

The quantum chromodynamics is the non-abelian SU (3) gauge theory of colored quarks and gluons
which are conﬁned in color singled hadronic bound states: it describes the strong force but does not
give a simple qualitative and dynamical understanding of conﬁnement.

10

Finally, the achievement of the standard model was the elaboration of a uniﬁed description of the
strong, weak and electromagnetic forces in the context of quantum gauge ﬁeld theories [G-G-S].

Unfortunately, at very small distances (Planck length), the quantum ﬂuctuations of the space-time
become important breaking down the concept of a continuum space-time: this constitutes the limit
of validity of the gauge theories.

b) String theory

At the Planck energy ( ≃ 1019 Gev ), the standard model is thus falling. Furthermore, at this
energy scale, the gravitational interactions become strong and cannot be neglected. It was then the
challenge of string theory to combine the structure of quantum ﬁeld theory [Ati] and the standard
model with general relativity.

In string theories, point-like particles are replaced by one-dimensional extended strings as fundamen-
tal objects in such a way that the basic input parameter is the mass per unit length of the string,
its tension

where ℓs is the characteristic length scale of the string.

T = 1

2πα′ ≡ 1
2πℓs

In spite of a great activity in superstring theory [Del→Wit], [Pol] for several decades, it seems that
string theory is not yet a matter ﬁeld with a stable framework [Wit1]: the underlying conceptual
principles are not well understood and, furthermore, there is a lack of contact with experiment [S-S],
[Sch].

2.5 The main relevant concepts of quantum (ﬁeld) theories

Having quickly reviewed the main concepts of classical, quantum ﬁeld and string theories, we shall now
try to grasp the adequate concepts necessary to build up an algebraic quantum theory whose aim consists
in endowing the elementary particles with an internal quantum structure.

So, from the developments of the ﬁrst and second quantizations, of the gauge and string theories, the

following structural concepts may be taken out:

• the dynamics of a set of r particles, described by r material points having k = 3r external degrees
of freedom, is given by a Hamiltonian function of 3r coordinates and momenta operators obeying
(non-)commutation relations and acting on the particle states.

A von Neumann algebra of operators acting on the particle states of a linear Hilbert space
is then introduced [v.Neu], [Dir2].

• the matricial representation of the operators, leading to eigenvalue equations, implies:

a) the introduction of internal dimensions corresponding to the ranks of the matricial represen-

b) an underlying concept of bilinearity since the set of r × r matrices over a ring R forms a

tations of the operators.

R − R-bimodule under addition.

• the wave aspect of the ﬁrst quantization of elementary particles leads to develop the particle mass-
wave functions as linear superpositions of plane waves whose numbers are the above mentioned
internal dimensions.

11

• the relativistic aspect of the quantum theories, based on bilinear relativistic invariants of space-
time, involves that the solutions of the relativistic equations split into positive energy solutions
of particles and into symmetric negative energy solutions associated with the corresponding
antiparticles [Dir5].

• the notion of ﬁeld in quantum theories allowed to precise the structure of the quantum systems by

introducing:

a) the radiation ﬁeld as composed of a set of harmonic oscillators whose (in)ﬁnite number
corresponds to the quantum internal dimension, also called in QFT the number of normal
modes.

b) each normal mode µ of a harmonic oscillator as composed of (n)µ quanta created from a

vacuum state.

c) creation and annihilation operators respectively raising and lowering the numbers of
quanta on the harmonic oscillators, allowing to generate an (in)ﬁnite set of states of higher
energy.

2.6 Connecting general relativity to quantum ﬁeld theories

The new structure of the proposed algebraic quantum theory will thus be based on the main relevant
concepts of quantum ﬁeld theories, as developed in section 2.5. It must then be a theory of elementary
particles characterized by:

• a quantum nature where the quanta are explicitly described mathematically.

• a wave aspect.

• a ﬁeld and string structure.

• bilinear invariants of space-time (and of energy-momentum) as those of special relativity.

Furthermore, one of the objectives of AQT is the uniﬁcation of general relativity with quantum ﬁeld

theories at the elementary particle level as developed in [Pie2].

In this respect, the Einstein ﬁeld equations:

λgµν + Gµν = 8πTµν ,

where:

λ is the cosmological constant;

•

•

gµν is the metric tensor of space-time;

• Gµν = Rµν − 1

2 gµνR with Rµν the Ricci tensor;

•

Tµν is the stress-energy tensor of matter;

may receive the following interpretation [Pie7]:

• the vacuum, described by λgµν + Gµν = 0 , then corresponds to:

12

– an expanding space-time structure given by λgµν ;

– a variation of this internal space-time structure given by Gµν = −λgµν and which must thus

be of contracting nature;

• the matter, given by 8πTµν , would be generated from the vacuum by the transformation sending

λgµν + Gµν = 0

into

λgµν + Gµν = 8πTµν .

If we wish to connect general relativity with quantum ﬁeld theories [P-R], we have to split the space-
time vacuum structure of GR into elementary discrete pieces and consider that these elementary vacua of
GR constitute the vacuum ﬁelds of QFT from which matter ﬁelds can be created.

Thus, the fundamental vacuum ﬁelds of AQT, associated with elementary particles, will be of expanding

discrete space-time nature.

But, at the macroscopic level of GR, the set of these discrete vacuum ﬁelds of elementary particles
looks like having a Riemannian continuum space-time structure: this corresponds to a macroscopic limit
so that the curvature in the neighbourhood of a point P is equal to the density of matter in this point.

This will constitute the starting point of the developments of AQT whose equations will thus not be
derived from a Lagrangian density, as currently done in quantum ﬁeld theories. But, the equations of
AQT, “covering” in some way the equations of QFT, allow to go back to Lagrangian densities.

In this respect, as AQT is not directly connected to Lagrangians having fairly often an “ad hoc”

character, it will not be a (non abelian) gauge theory.

2.7 Physical tools of AQT

AQT is a quantum theory of space-time structure of elementary particles. Its main physical tools will now
be succinctly developed and justiﬁed.

a) Referring to section 2.5, it is assumed that the fundamental internal structure of an elementary

particle is its vacuum structure of space-time.

b) The relativistic invariants envisaged in AQT as invariants of the space-time structure of elemen-

tary particles will not be characterized by a Minkowsky metric as

0 = c2 dt2 − dr2 ,

where dr2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 ,

where

but by an euclidian metric, which gives:

c2 dt2 = dt2
E2 = m2

0 + dr2 ,
0c4 + p2c2 .

and

c) Indeed, each one of the three embedded structures, constituting the total structure of an elementary
particle as it will be seen, is composed of a structure of “space” type, labeled “ S ” and of an
orthogonal structure of “time” type, labeled “ T0 ”, in such a way that their “quadratic sum”
T 2 = T 2

is now an Euclidian invariant of structure.

0 + S2

This is the case since “ T 2

0 ” can be partially or totally transformed into “ S2 ” and vice versa:

13

• the case where “ T 2

0 ” is totally transformed into “ S2 ” corresponds to the annihilation of a

fermion pair into a photon (pair).

• the case where “ S2 ” is totally transformed into “ T 2

0 ” would correspond to a particle at rest.

d) On the other hand, the bilinearity of the relativistic invariants as well as the matricial representation
of the operators lead us to consider that the microscopic fundamental structures are twofold: this
also results from the solutions of the relativistic wave equations.

In this respect, a new interpretation of the relativistic invariants will consist in considering that every
elementary particle is in fact a bisemiparticle [Pie1], composed of a left semiparticle, localized in
the upper half space, and of a right (symmetric) (co)semiparticle, localized in the lower half space
in such a way that:

• the product, right by left, of the right semiparticle by the left semiparticle gives rise to a
“working interaction space” generating the electric charge and the magnetic moment of the
(bisemi)particle by taking into account an oﬀ-diagonal metric which, added to the Euclidian
metric, leads to a Riemann metric.

• the right semiparticle, “dual” of the left semiparticle, is thus projected on the latter and is un-
observable unless the bisemiparticle be split into a pair of “particle-antiparticle” when entering
into a strong ﬁeld.

e) With this in view, the space-time structure of the vacuum of a bisemiparticle will be composed
of an (internal) time ﬁeld, corresponding to its “time” structure, and of a space ﬁeld, corresponding
to its “space” structure (see c)), in such a way that these ﬁelds be of twofold nature and localized
in orthogonal spaces. Referring to the emission and absorption of photons by fermions, it seems
judicious to consider that these time and space ﬁelds of the vacua of bisemiparticles, essentially
bisemifermions, are of bosonic nature, i.e. composed of a sum of harmonic oscillators characterized
by increasing numbers of quanta according to section 2.3 a): this allows to interpret very naturally
the quantum jumps and the energy levels of fermions on the basis of their internal structures of
vacuum.

Taking into account that an harmonic oscillator can be represented by a pair of by a product of
two circles having the same radius and rotating in opposite senses (see section 4.2 of [Pie3]) and
considering the homotopy between a closed string and a circle, a vacuum time (or space) ﬁeld will
be given by the (sum of) packets of products, right by left, of closed strings in such a way that:

• these packets are characterized by increasing integers µ , 1 ≤ µ ≤ q ≤ ∞ , referring to the

normal modes of a bosonic ﬁeld.

• the µ-th packet contains mµ products of pairs of closed strings, characterized by µ quanta and

localized respectively in the upper and in the lower half spaces.

f) The quanta, being irreducible subsets of ﬁelds, are assumed to be irreducible algebraic closed
subsets [Car] characterized by a Galois extension degree equal to N . Compactiﬁed, these quanta
constitute “big points” of closed strings.

14

g) As we are concerned with biobjects, we have to consider biquanta (i.e. products of left quanta by
corresponding right quanta) on bistrings which are products of pairs of right strings localized in
the lower half space by the corresponding left strings localized in the upper half space.

h) Remark that the increasing integers µ , labeling the packets of bistrings and referring to the normal
modes of the ﬁeld, are the internal dimensions of algebraic nature of the considered system (or
ﬁeld) since they correspond to the numbers of algebraic quanta on the strings. These integers µ also
refer to the numbers of internal degrees of freedom of a ﬁrst quantized system according to section
2.2 b) and c).

i) A rotating closed bistring, noted sµR ×sµL , having µ quanta on sµR and on sµL and belonging to the
vacuum space ﬁeld of a bisemifermion, is interpreted as the vacuum (space) structure of a minimal
(bisemi-)photon at µ quanta. Another possibility for a (bisemi-)photon would be m(µ) closed
bistrings at µ quanta, where m(µ) denotes the multiplicity, since photons obey the Bose-Einstein
statistics.

j) What is especially surprising is the connection of the structure of a ﬁeld as described in this section

with the global program of Langlands on GL(2) [Gel], [Kna]

ML of C -valued
Indeed, as it will be seen in the next chapter, a ﬁeld is a (bisemi)sheaf
diﬀerentiable bifunctions on the bilinear algebraic semigroup GL2(Lv × Lv) where Lv (resp. Lv )
denotes (the sum of) the set of real completions corresponding to the left (resp. right) ramiﬁed alge-
braic extensions of a global number ﬁeld of characteristic 0 . Remark that ⊗D denotes a “diagonal”
tensor product characterized by a diagonal metric.

A Lv and A Lv are adele semirings over corresponding prime real places: this is the global bilinear
correspondence of Langlands on GL(2) .

f

k) The space and time ﬁelds of the vacuum considered until now are characterized by an Euclidian
metric. If we refer to a Riemann metric, it can then be proved that the oﬀ-diagonal components of
the metric tensor split into electric and magnetic oﬀ-diagonal components to which an electric ﬁeld,
responsible for the electric charge, and a magnetic ﬁeld correspond respectively.

l) The spatial extension of these space and time vacuum ﬁelds is of the order of the Planck length. At
this length scale, there are strong ﬂuctuations which generate singularities on the pairs of strings of

these ﬁelds, or, more exactly, on the pairs of diﬀerentiable functions on completions which describe
these strings mathematically.

Consequently, versal deformations of degenerate singularities of corank 1 and maximum codimension
3, as well as blowups of these versal deformations are produced in such a way that:

• two embedded ﬁelds, labeled by “ M G ” (for middle-ground) and by “ M ” (for mass), may
cover the time and space ﬁelds, labeled by “ ST ” (for space-time), of the most internal structure

m) The bisemifermions, considered in this paper, are the bilinear correspondents of the elementary

fermions, that is to say:

• the leptons e− , µ− , τ − and their neutrinos,

• the quarks u+ , d− , s− , c+ , b− , t+ .

The bisemihadrons, being the bilinear correspondents of the hadrons composed of baryons and
of mesons, are characterized by a central core bistructure of time type to which are tied up three
bisemiquarks in the case of bisemibaryons or a pair of (semi)quarks in the case of mesons as it was
developed in [Pie4].

The aim of the physical tools of AQT, reviewed in this section, consists in introducing a plausible
internal structure of elementary particles which is summarized in the next proposition.

2.8 Proposition

a) Every elementary fermion must be viewed as an elementary bisemifermion:

16

• composed of a left semifermion, localized in the upper half space, and of a right semifermion,

localized in the symmetric lower half space.

• centered on an emergence point.

• to which it can be associated a “working space” composed of (tensor) products between right and
left internal structures, respectively of the right and of the left semifermions, in such a way that
the oﬀ-diagonal components of these (tensor) products (after a suitable blow-up morphism) are
responsible for the generation of the electric charge and of the magnetic moment.

b) An elementary bisemifermion is composed of three central diagonal embedded bistructures whose
two internal, labeled “ ST ” and “ M G ”, are its internal vacuum from which the most external
bistructure, which is its mass (“ M ”) bistructure, is created.

The vacuum most internal structure “ ST ” could correspond to the dark energy at the Planck scale.

c) Each central diagonal bistructure is a (bilinear) ﬁeld, direct sum of a time (bilinear) ﬁeld and of a

space (bilinear) ﬁeld.

Each time or space ﬁeld decomposes into (the sum of ) a set of packets of pairs of closed strings in
the “ ST ” case or of open strings in the “ M G ” and “ M ” cases.

d) Each packet of pairs of strings:

• is such that the pairs of strings behave like harmonic oscillators.

• is characterized by an integer µ corresponding to a normal mode.

• is such that its strings have a structure composed of µ quanta which are irreducible algebraic

closed subsets of degree N .

e) Each pair of space ﬁeld strings, characterized by an integer µ , is interpreted as the central diagonal
bistructure (“ ST , “ M G ” or “ M ”) of a (bisemi)photon giving then a wave nature of radiation
type to the (space) ﬁeld.

Chapter 3

Algebraic representations of brane
and string ﬁelds

Referring to chapter 2 and, more particularly, to proposition 2.8, the mathematical deﬁnition of a time or
space (classical) ﬁeld of the vacuum of a bisemifermion is of central importance. This will constitute the
content of this chapter.

3.1 Archimedean symmetric completions

• Let K be a global number ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and let K[x] denote a polynomial ring composed

of a family of pairs of polynomials {P (x), P (−x)} , x being a time or space variable.

The splitting ﬁeld, generated from K[x] , is the algebraic extension L(c) of K , assumed to be
generally closed. This splitting ﬁeld was shown [Pie5] to be most generally a symmetric splitting
ﬁeld L(c) = L(c)
R and of a left extension semiﬁeld
L(c)
L in one-to-one correspondence. The notation L refers to a real splitting ﬁeld while Lc denotes a
complex splitting ﬁeld.

• The left and right equivalence classes of Archimedean completions of L(c)

R ) are the left
R ) which are such that the real left (resp. right) places cover

L (resp. L(c)

and right places of L(c)
the corresponding complex places: they are noted, in the real case:

L (resp. L(c)

v = {v1, · · · , vµ, · · · , vq}

(resp.

v = {v1, · · · , vµ, · · · , vq} )

and, in the complex case:

ω = {ω1, · · · , ωµ, · · · , ωq}

(resp. ω = {ω1, · · · , ωµ, · · · , ωq} ),

1 ≤ µ ≤ q ≤ ∞ .

• The real pseudo-ramiﬁed completions at the real inﬁnite places v (resp. v ) are assumed to be
generated from irreducible one-dimensional K-semimodules Lv1
) having ranks

one-dimensional complex K-semimodules Lω1

that the complex irreducible completions be covered by the real irreducible completions.

) having ranks [Lω1

µ

µ

So, the ranks (or degrees) of the real pseudo-ramiﬁed completions Lvµ (resp. Lvµ ) will be given by
integers modulo N while the ranks of the complex pseudo-ramiﬁed completions Lωµ (resp. Lωµ )
will also be given by integers modulo N according to:

[Lvµ : K] = ∗ + µ (cid:5) N

(resp.

[Lvµ : K] = ∗ + µ (cid:5) N

≃ µ N
[Lωµ : K] = ∗ + µ (cid:5) m(µ) N

or

≃ µ N )
[Lωµ : K] = ∗ + µ (cid:5) m(µ) N

(resp.

≃ µ m(µ) N

≃ µ m(µ) N )

where

– ∗ denotes an integer inferior to N ,

– µ is called a global residue degree.

• As a place is an equivalence class of completions, we have to consider, at each real place vµ
(resp. vµ ), a set of m(µ) real completions Lvµ,mµ (resp. Lvµ,mµ ), mµ ∈ N , m(µ) = sup(mµ) + 1 ,
equivalent to Lvµ (resp. Lvµ ), with mµ = 0 , and characterized by the same ranks as Lvµ (resp.
Lvµ ).

On the other hand, as the complex completions were assumed to be covered by the real completions,
the multiplicity m(µ) of the complex completions will be equal to 0 , ∀ µ , 1 ≤ µ ≤ q ≤ ∞ .

• Let Lv+ = ⊕

In this context, the pseudo-ramiﬁed adele semiring A Lv (resp. A Lv ) will be introduced in the
real case by:

A Lω = Π

(resp. A Lω = Π

where the product Π

runs over the Archimedean prime completions [J-L].

3.2 Algebraic bilinear semigroups over real completions

• Let T2(Lv) (resp. T t

2(Lv) ) denote the group of upper (resp. lower) triangular matrices of order 2 over
the set Lv = {Lv1, · · · , Lvµ, · · · , Lvµ,mµ , · · · , Lvq,mq } (resp. Lv = {Lv1 , · · · , Lvµ, · · · , Lvµ,mµ , · · · ,
Lvq,mq } ) of real completions.

19

• Then, an algebraic bilinear general semigroup GL2(Lv ×Lv) = T t

2(Lv)×T2(Lv) can be introduced

in such a way that:

a) the product (Lv × Lv) over the two sets Lv and Lv of completions must be taken over the set

{Lvµ,mµ × Lvµ,mµ }vµ,mµ of products of corresponding pairs of completions.

b) GL2(Lv × Lv) has the Gauss bilinear decomposition:

GL2(Lv × Lv) = [D2(Lv) × D2(Lv)][U T2(Lv) × U T t

2(Lv)]

where:

– D2((cid:5)) is a subgroup of diagonal matrices.
– U T2((cid:5)) (resp. U T t

2((cid:5)) ) is the subgroup of upper (resp. lower) unitriangular matrices.

c) GL2(Lv × Lv) has for modular representation space Repsp(GL2(Lv × Lv)) the tensor product
2(Lv)-semimodule MR(Lv) by a left T2(Lv)-semimodule ML(Lv) ,

MR(Lv)⊗ML(Lv) of a right T t
also noted MR ⊗ ML .

d) GL2(Lv × Lv) covers its linear equivalent GL2(Lv−v) [Bor], where Lv−v ≃ Lv ∪ Lv , having the

GL2(Lv−v) = D2(Lv−v) × [U T2(Lv−v) × U T t

2(Lv−v)]

linear Gauss decomposition:

if we take into account the maps:

– U T2(Lv−v) → U T2(Lv) .
2(Lv−v) → U T t
– U T t
2(Lv) .
– D2(Lv−v) → D2(Lv × Lv) .

e) its µ-th conjugacy class representative with respect to the product, right by left, Lv1

of irreducible real completions of rank N has for representation the GL2(Lvµ,mµ × Lvµ,mµ )-
subbisemimodule Mvµ,mµ ⊗Mvµ,mµ where Mvµ,mµ (resp. Mvµ,mµ ) constitutes the one-dimensional
modular representation of the (µ, mµ)-th conjugacy class representative of T2(Lv) (resp. T t
2(Lv) ).
In the context of QFT, Mvµ,mµ and Mvµ,mµ are strings at µ quanta.

be the set of complex completions covered by the set of real completions Lv (resp. Lv ).
Then, similarly as in section 3.2, an algebraic bilinear semigroup GL2(Lω × Lω) ≡ T t

way that:

a) GL2(Lω × Lω) has a Gauss bilinear decomposition.

b) GL2(Lω × Lω) has for modular representation space Repsp(GL2(Lω × Lω)) the tensor product

3.4 Toroidal compactiﬁcations

A toroidal compactiﬁcation of the real and complex completions must then be envisaged in such a
way that the real completions are transformed into one-dimensional (semi)tori or (semi)circles and the
complex completions are transformed into two-dimensional (semi)tori. This toroidal compactiﬁcation
was introduced in chapter 1 of [Pie4] and corresponds to a projective emergent toroidal isomorphism of
completions:

Inclusions of the “real” bilinear algebraic semigroups into
their “complex” equivalents

• Let MR(Lω) ⊗ ML(Lω)) be the representation space Repsp(GL2(Lω × Lω)) of the bilinear algebraic

semigroup GL2(Lω × Lω) over products of pairs of complex completions.

• And let MR(Lv) ⊗ ML(Lv) be the corresponding representation space Repsp(GL2(Lv × Lv)) of the

bilinear algebraic semigroup GL2(Lv × Lv) over products of pairs of real completions.

• The inclusion MR(Lv) ⊗ ML(Lv) ⊆ MR(Lω) ⊗ ML(Lω) of the real GL2(Lv × Lv)-bisemimodule
MR(Lv) ⊗ ML(Lv) into the complex GL2(Lω × Lω)-bisemimodule MR(Lω) ⊗ ML(Lω) implies that:

Proof.

a) The bisections φR(Mvµ,mµ ) ⊗ φL(Mvµ,mµ ) of the real bisemisheaf φR(MR(Lv)) ⊗ φL(ML(Lv)) are
C -valued diﬀerentiable bifunctions on the conjugacy class representatives Mvµ,mµ ⊗ Mvµ,mµ of the
bilinear algebraic semigroup GL2(Lv × Lv) . Now, Mvµ,mµ ⊗ Mvµ,mµ is the (tensor) product of two
symmetric (closed) strings at µ quanta in such a way that Mvµ,mµ ⊗ Mvµ,mµ (and also φR(Mvµ,mµ ) ⊗
φL(Mvµ,mµ ) ) behaves like a harmonic oscillator [Pie4]. So, the real bisemisheaf φR(MR(Lv)) ⊗
φL(ML(Lv)) , constituted of a set Γ(φR(MR(Lv)) ⊗ φL(ML(Lv))) of bisections, is a physical “string
ﬁeld” according to chapter 2, and, especially proposition 2.8.

This string ﬁeld has two spin internal degrees of freedom, corresponding to the two possible directions
of rotation of the strings, left and right symmetric strings rotating in opposite directions.

b) As the real bisemisheaf φR(MR(Lv)) ⊗ φL(ML(Lv)) is included into (and covers) the complex bisem-
isheaf φR(MR(Lω)) ⊗ φL(ML(Lω)) according to proposition 3.7 and as the complex conjugacy class
representatives Mωµ and Mωµ over which are deﬁned respectively the sections of the complex sem-
isheaves φR(MR(Lω)) and φL(ML(Lω)) are one-dimensional complex Lie semisubgroups, the complex
bisemisheaf is a physical brane ﬁeld.

of the products, right by left, of Hecke operators [Pie5].

3.11 Proposition

1. Let τh(ML(Lv)) (resp. τh(MR(Lv)) ) be a real compactiﬁed smooth general semivariety of which

regular functions:

Then, on this compactiﬁed semivariety τh(ML(Lv)) (resp. τh(MR(Lv)) ), the function fv(z) (resp.

2. Let τh(ML(Lω)) (resp. τh(MR(Lω)) ) denote the associated complex compactiﬁed smooth general
semivariety of which conjugacy class representatives Mωµ (resp. Mωµ ) are glued together on a
surface and on which the regular functions:

fωµ(yµ) : Mωµ −→ Fωµ

(resp.

fωµ (y∗µ) : Mωµ −→ Fωµ )

are deﬁned.

Then, on this compactiﬁed semivariety τh(ML(Lω)) (resp. τh(MR(Lω)) ), the function fω(y) (resp.
fω(y∗) ), deﬁned in a neighborhood of a point y0 (resp. y∗

• This proposition presents a way of constructing a holomorpic function from functions on compactiﬁed
conjugacy class representatives in such a way that each term of the power series development of the
holomorphic function corresponds to a conjugacy class representative.

• If the number of considered conjugacy class representatives tends to ∞ in the power series develop-
ment, then it is hoped that this one is converging to z (or to y ) in some neighborhood of z0 (resp.

3.13 Polynomial functions on 2D-semivarieties

• If, instead of gluing the complex conjugacy class representatives Mωµ (resp. Mωµ ) on a surface, we
stack them up in order to get a volume foliated by the two-dimensional conjugacy class representatives
Mωµ (resp. Mωµ ), we shall obtain a three-dimensional compactiﬁed smooth semivariety τc(ML(Lω))
(resp. τc(MR(Lω)) ).

• Similarly, as the set {Mvµ,mµ }mµ (resp. {Mvµ,mµ }µ,mµ ) of real conjugacy class representatives cov-
ers the surface Mωµ (resp. Mωµ ) if they are glued together as it was done in proposition 3.11,
the family {Mvµ,mµ }mµ (resp. {Mvµ,mµ }mµ ) of real conjugacy class representatives can be stacked
up into a three-dimensional compactiﬁed smooth semivariety τc(ML(Lv)) (resp. τc(MR(Lv)) ) foli-
ated by the set of two-dimensional compactiﬁed conjugacy class representatives {Mvµ,mµ }mµ (resp.
{Mvµ,mµ }mµ ).

• So, a polynomial function on the smooth semivariety τc(ML(Lω)) (resp. τc(MR(Lω)) ) will be given

3.17 Proposition

The brane ﬁeld φR(MR(Lω)) ⊗ φL(ML(Lω)) (as well as the string ﬁeld φR(MR(Lv)) ⊗ φL(ML(Lv)) ) is
of solvable nature in the sense that:

a) their bisections are embedded in the following sequence:

φR(Mω1) ⊗ φL(Mω1 ) ⊆ · · · ⊆ φR(Mωµ) ⊗ φL(Mωµ ) ⊆ · · · ⊆ φR(Mωq ) ⊗ φL(Mωq ) , µ ≤ q ≤ ∞ .

b) its representation given by the bisemimodule φR(M +

L (Lω+)) (and its toroidal equiv-
alent, see proposition 3.9) is such that it is generated in a solvable way by a tower of embedded
subbisemimodules:

Proof.

• The brane ﬁeld is of solvable nature because it is algebraic, that is to say, generated under the

(bi)action of the product, right by left, of appropriate Galois or Weil groups [Pie4].

• The holomorphic representation is said to be solvable if it is generated in a solvable way, i.e. that

we have a tower of holomorphic subrepresentations given by:

3.18 Space-time ﬁelds of the vacua of (bisemi)fermions

a) Assume that the string ﬁeld φR(MR(Lv)) ⊗ φL(ML(Lv)) , included into the corresponding brane
ﬁeld φR(MR(Lω)) ⊗ φL(ML(Lω)) , has a representation as described in section 3.13, i.e. that the
family {φR(Mvµ,mµ ) ⊗ φL(Mvµ,mµ )}µ,mµ of the sets {φR(Mvµ,mµ ) ⊗ φL(Mvµ,mµ )}mµ ( mµ varying)
of bisections, glued together into surfaces, is stacked up into a 3D-volume.

This string ﬁeld then corresponds to a space ﬁeld of the vacuum internal structure of an elementary

Let r = p + q be the number of algebraic dimensions of time and space.

Then, as a consequence of the solvability of the extended bilinear Hilbert space H +

a of space-time, a

tower of modular subbialgebras of von Neumann can be deﬁned.

4.1.3 Proposition

Proof.

• As the bisemisheaves

a are deﬁned over algebraic bilinear semigroups (see section
3.6), their bisections on the conjugacy classes of these algebraic bilinear semigroups correspond to
extended bilinear Hilbert subspaces which form the following sequence of embedded subspaces:

a (r) ,

1 ≤ σ ≤ r ,

where σ denotes a general algebraic dimension “covering” the running indices γ and µ respectively
of time and space.

So, H +

a will be said to be solvable by extending this concept from solvable groups.

• As a consequence, the bialgebra of von Neumann M a
a sequence of corresponding embedded subbialgebras:

R×L(H +

a ) on H +

a also decomposes according to

4.1.4 Tower of sums of extended bilinear Hilbert subspaces

Taking into account the representation of the string ﬁeld into the sum of its bisections according to section
3.8 and proposition 3.9, we can introduce a tower of embedded extended bilinear Hilbert subspaces:

H +

a {1} ⊂ · · · ⊂ H +

a {σ} ⊂ · · · ⊂ H +

a {r}

in such a way that:

• H +

a {σ} =

H +

a (τ+) , where H +

a (τ+) = ⊕
mτ

H +

a (τ, mτ )

• H +

• H +

H +

a (τ+) .

So, every extended bilinear Hilbert subspace H +

a {σ} , 1 ≤ σ ≤ r , is the sum of the extended bilinear
a (τ+) , the index τ running over the algebraic dimensions inferior to it, in such a way

Hilbert subspaces H +
that the Hilbert subspace H +

4.1.6 Projectors and space-time states of ﬁelds

equivalent H +

4.2 Creations and annihilations of mass string ﬁelds

4.2.1 Fusion at the Planck scale of GR with QFT

In chapter 3 and 4.1, it was seen how (brane and) string ﬁelds of the vacuum internal structure of
(bisemi)fermions as well as their states could be generated algebraically.

STLR

⊗D

M T S
STL

f

f

As indicated in section 2.7, strong ﬂuctuations occur on these vacuum string ﬁelds

because they have a spatial extension of the order of the Planck length.

These strong ﬂuctuations generate singularities on the sections (or strings) of these vacuum space-
time ﬁelds in such a way that, if these singularities are degenerate, they are able to produce, by versal
deformations and blowups of these, two new covering space-time ﬁelds of which the most external can be
interpreted as mass ﬁelds of these (bisemi)fermions.

By this way, general relativity can be connected at the microscopic level to quantum ﬁeld theory as
developed in section 2.6. And, the set of vacuum string ﬁelds
STL could correspond to the
dark energy which develops in this context a dynamical aspect [Pie2] since it is able to create mass ﬁelds
of elementary particles.

L(vµ,mµ ) (resp.
R(vµ,mµ ) ) is deﬁned over τi,µ quanta, τi,µ ∈ N , and is thus characterized by a rank or degree
ωi
equal to τi,µ (cid:5) N .

The versal unfolding of a singularity then consists in “pumping” external free quanta which are
projected in the neighborhood of the singularity in order to stabilize it.

4.2.3 Blowup of the versal deformation

• The blowup of the versal deformation of the semisheaf

M S

M S

spreading-out isomorphism:

SOTL = (τvωL

◦ πsL )

f
(resp. SOTR = (τvωR

f
◦ πsR ) )

where

–

πsL :

M S

M S

(resp. πsR :

is an endomorphism disconnecting the three base sheaves θSL (resp. θSR ) from

τvωR : TAN(θSR) −→ θSR )

of the vertical tangent bundle TvωL (resp. TvωR ) sending θSL (resp. θSR ) in the total tangent
space TAN(θSL ) (resp. TAN(θSR) ).

• The spreading-out isomorphism then projects the three functions ωi

• It must be noticed that the left and right middle ground and mass semisheaves are produced sym-

metrically since it is assumed that:

a) they are centered on the emergence point (local origin) of the elementary (bisemi)fermion.

b) the perturbations, generating singularities, are identical locally around the emergence point in

the upper and lower half spaces.

Interacting ﬁelds of interacting bisemifermions

4.3.1 The importance of the twofold nature of the microscopic reality

• Chapter 3 and 4 until now have dealt with the algebraic generation of the three embedded diagonal
ﬁelds “ ST ”, “ M G ” and “ M ” constituting the central internal structure of a bisemifermion,
without taking explicitly into account the electric (internal) ﬁeld (i.e. the electric charge) and the
internal magnetic ﬁeld (i.e. the magnetic moment) except at the end of chapter 3.

• It appears thus that the internal structure of a bisemifermion is very complex, especially if we
consider that oﬀ-diagonal ﬁelds of interaction exist between the three central diagonal ﬁelds “ ST ”,
“ M G ” and “ M ”, as developed at the beginning of chapter 3 in [Pie4].

• The fact of considering that the nature at the microscopic scale is twofold allowed us to introduce
the diagonal ﬁelds of elementary (bisemi)fermions and the oﬀ-diagonal magnetic and electric ﬁelds.

But, the twofold nature of reality is of crucial importance when the problem of interactions between
(bisemi)particles is envisaged, as it will be done succinctly in the following sections.

46

4.3.2 Non-orthogonal reducible modular representation space

• As developed at the beginning of chapter 5 of [Pie4], the time or space string ﬁeld(s) “ ST ”, “ M G ”
and “ M ” of a set of M interacting bisemifermions is given by the completely reducible modular
representation space Repsp(GL2M (Lv+ × Lv+ )) of the bilinear general semigroup GL2M (Lv+ × Lv+ )
(see section 3.2.e)).

• Given the partition 2M = 21 + 22 + · · · + 2i + · · · + 2M of 2M , the completely reducible modular
bilinear non orthogonal representation space Repsp(GL2M(i6=j) (Lv+ × Lv+ )) decomposes into
[Pie5]:

Repsp(GL2M(i6=j) (Lv+ × Lv+))

=

M
⊞
i=1

Repsp(GL2i (Lv+ × Lv+ ))

Repsp(T t

2i(Lv+ ) × T2j(Lv+ ))

M
⊞
i6=j=1

while the corresponding orthogonal representation space is given by:

Repsp(GL2M(i) (Lv+ × Lv+ ))

= ⊞M

i=1 Repsp(GL2i (Lv+ × Lv+ )) ⊂ Repsp(GL2Mi6=j (Lv+ × Lv+)) .

• So, the fact of considering bilinear algebraic semigroups allows to take into account oﬀ-diagonal
modular representation spaces which are responsible for the generation of interacting ﬁelds between
bisemiparticles as it will be seen in the next section.

4.3.3 Gravito-electro-magnetic ﬁelds of interaction

• Assume that Repsp(GL2i(Lv+ × Lv+ )) is the string mass ﬁeld of space

of the i-th
considered bisemifermion as envisaged previously. Then, for a set of M (interacting) bisemifermions,
the string mass ﬁelds of space will be given by:

⊗(D)

• If these M bisemifermions are free, then their string mass ﬁelds of space reduce to:

ﬁelds of interaction are generated between the “ ST ”, “ M G ” and “ M ” internal ﬁelds of these
f
bisemifermions as developed in chapter 5 in [Pie4].

4.3.4 Bosonic character of the ﬁelds of the bisemifermions

• In AQT, the state(s) of the ﬁeld(s) (for example, space ﬁeld of mass) of a set of M (free) bisemifermions
can be constructed as the direct sum(s) of the state(s) of the M individual space ﬁelds of mass ac-
cording to sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.

• This contrasts with the treatment envisaged in QFT for the state (of the ﬁeld) of a set of M free
fermions which is given as an antisymmetric superposition of the product of the individual states in
order to obey the Pauli exclusion principle.

• As a consequence, the ﬁeld of a set of M (free) bisemifermions does not behave in AQT like a
fermionic ﬁeld of QFT but as a bosonic ﬁeld, the fermionic character being given by the oﬀ-
diagonal electric ﬁelds of interaction, which corresponds to the electric charges at the individual
fermionic levels.

• Indeed, QFT only works with the linear mass ﬁeld (and, the not well deﬁned vacuum ﬁeld) of
fermions while AQT has introduced time and space ﬁelds of bilinear type, which allows to encircle
the fermionic character diﬀerently and more precisely as it was envisaged in QFT.

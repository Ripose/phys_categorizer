Discrete symmetry and quark, lepton and vector gauge boson

mass expressions.

G.R. Filewood.

School of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3052 Australia.

Some interesting mass expressions for all the quarks, leptons and gauge

bosons are presented based on simple discrete symmetry. Precise expressions

for the nucleon masses are presented as an example of the calculation tech-

niques employed. The structure of the Higgs sector is explored.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the standard model the masses of the fermions are generated by interaction with the

Higgs ﬁeld;

Lmass = g ¯ψLψRφ

(1)

where g is a (dimensionless) coupling constant and φ is the scalar Higgs ﬁeld of dimension

l−1. The Dirac mass so deﬁned is in fact speciﬁed by the parameter g and it is fair to say the

expression (1) tells us nothing at all about the masses of the fermions; the detail is hidden

in the arbitrary parameter g and the unspeciﬁed mass of φ. One might reasonably ask

whether the Lagrangian ﬁeld theory approach is even in principle capable of explaining the

masses of the fermions. Certainly the conventional perturbative approach to (electro-weak)

ﬁeld theory would seem to be inadequate for the purposes of deﬁning particle masses given

the requirement for mass renormalisation in such an approach and even non-perturbative

approaches to the strong interaction require the insertion ‘by-hand’ of the current quark

masses. These failings certainly suggest that an alternative approach to determining the

1

origin of the spectrum of particle masses might be required; provided always that consistency

with the standard model is maintained as the latter is certainly empirically valid over a wide

range of experimental parameters.

The data on particle masses is particularly impressive on two counts; ﬁrstly that so much

precision data is available now and secondly that the standard model fails so miserably to

account for it!

It is almost accepted wisdom in contemporary high energy physics that,

possibly with the exception of neutrino physics, experiment lags behind theory; yet this is

not true of the data that exists on particle masses! It therefore behoves us to look closely

at the data for clues that might alert us to underlying symmetry not apparent from the

standard model.

This paper presents such a approach; it does so by looking at possible discrete symmetries

which might underpin the observed spectrum of particle masses and relating these back to

the known continuous symmetries of the standard model. The link between the discrete and

continuous symmetry in the model presented is provided by local gauge invariance. Particle

rest masses then arise as a relic feature of an otherwise unobservable discrete symmetry

underpinning quark and lepton structure.

Thus the model presented here is essentially semi-empirical but there is a long history

of discovery in physics based on ﬁnding patterns in physical data. Some of the most famous

would include the discovery of the periodic table of elements and the Balmer series [1]

although one could argue that all basic science evolves ultimately from a study of the patterns

observed in nature.

In the framework of the symmetry used to derive fermion masses all interactions are

treated in an entirely non-perturbative manner. Radiative corrections to particle masses

are calculated using a reasonable non-perturbative ansatz. This gives quite precise mass

predictions which can be compared with experiment; including the masses of stable hadrons.

The paper is organised as follows;

Sections II-V Introduce the basic geometric ideas employed throughout. These sections

are long and quite ‘wordy’ but the concepts are unfamiliar and a little abstract so it was

2

thought, at the risk of losing the readers attention, probably worthwhile trying to get the

ideas across with as much explanation as possible.

Sections VI-X start on some more concrete analysis and puts the ideas presented in the

earlier sections on a footing capable of leading to systematic mass calculations concentrating

on ﬁrst generation hadrons. The material is quite diﬀerent to a standard QCD approach

although the reader will note some overall symmetry features in common with QCD. As men-

tioned, there is reason to believe that a standard QFT approach cannot (even in principle)

determine mass ratios from ﬁrst principles (i.e. without arbitrary parameters).

In section XI we look at the Higgs sector of the theory from the point of view of geometry

leading to the masses of second and third generation objects and massive vector gauge

bosons. This section is quite heuristic as only vague hints of the origin of the pattern of

Higgs couplings can be gleaned from the values of the couplings themselves - which have

been determined by comparison with experiment - although the symmetry of the system

leads to many constraints on the values the couplings can take; in particular they can only

take certain ﬁxed values which then allows comparison with precision measurements. Lastly

we look at the issue of neutrino masses and generalisations of postulate 1 to include more

complex models of the space-time continuum.

II. BACKGROUND IDEAS

Experiment has unequivocally established the reality of quarks, behaving as point-like

objects, as the constituents of hadrons and also shows no indication that leptons have any

sub-structure. Quarks and leptons come in three generations or families;

quarks; top bottom charm strange up down

leptons; ντ

τ

νµ

µ

νe

e

and the masses generally decrease from left to right; with the exception of the neutrinos

which have much smaller, or zero, mass in comparison with their partner charged lepton.

The other pattern evident is that, for each family, the quark masses are greater than the

3

corresponding charged lepton. Thus the bottom quark, for example, has a mass in the

vicinity of 5GeV whilst the tau lepton has a mass in the vicinity of 1.7Gev. In the standard

model the masses of the neutrinos are zero; these being left-handed particles only and not

possessing a Dirac mass. Current data suggests that neutrino masses are non-zero and we

will look at this issue towards the end of the paper. In what follows in the interim we will

treat the neutrinos as massless.

The standard model theory of interactions is based on the principle of local gauge in-

variance. In the case of electromagnetism this is simply a U(1) phase. A renormalisable

Lagrangian is generally taken to contain at most the ﬁeld and its ﬁrst derivative only. The

derivative of the spinor ﬁeld is not invariant under local phase transformations;

∂µ(eiθ(x)ψ) = ∂µθ(x) eiθ(x)ψ + eiθ(x)∂µψ 6= eiθ(x)∂µψ

but under a covariant derivative containing the electromagnetic ﬁeld the fermion ﬁeld trans-

forms as follows;

(2)

(3)

Dµ(eiθ(x)ψ) = i∂µθ(x) eiθ(x)ψ + eiθ(x)∂µψ + ieAµeiθ(x)ψ

Dµ ≡ ∂µ + ieAµ

Now, under the (commuting) U(1) symmetry we let the gauge ﬁeld transform as follows;

′

Aµ → A

µ ≡ Aµ −

∂µθ(x)

1
e

Finally, substituting this deﬁnition in eq.(3) gives;

Dµ(eiθ(x)ψ) = eiθ(x)∂µψ + ieAµeiθ(x)ψ = eiθ(x)(Dψ)

(4)

In the case of the weak interactions the local gauge invariance is more complex but the

basic idea is the same; the spinor ﬁeld is represented by a left-handed doublet and right

handed singlet. The corresponding phase factor for the doublet is an S.U.(2) symmetry and

local gauge invariance occurs under a covariant derivative involving a trio of gauge ﬁelds

derived from the adjoint representation of S.U.(2); rather than the single ﬁeld that arises

4

from the U(1) phase factor in electro-magnetism. Thus the right handed singlets do not

‘feel’ the force mediated by the weak vector gauge bosons.

Likewise, in the case of quantum chromodynamics, local gauge invariance under S.U.(3)

colour leads to a theory of the strong interaction with 8 gauge bosons reﬂecting the adjoint

representation.

There is now ample evidence to assert that the S.U.(3)×S.U.(2)L×U(1)Y standard model

is a (not necessarily the) correct description of fundamental structure yet nowhere do we

ﬁnd, apart from the subjective criterion of mathematical elegance, any reason why nature

has chosen local gauge invariance as the cornerstone of its foundation.

In the following

sections we explore a geometric model capable of accounting for nature’s predilection for

local gauge invariance.

Let us begin by considering the structure of the continuum.

In physics we routinely

assume that space-time is a real continuum. By this we mean that any interval in space

(time) may be represented by the real numbers as the ratio of the size of the interval in

question with some standard unit interval (such as a metre).

The structure of the continuum is quite interesting mathematically.

In terms of set

theory Georg Cantor showed that the continuum may be analysed in terms of cardinality, or

order, of sets. This idea will be crucial for our study of particle masses. We may analyse the

continuum in terms of a hierarchy of cardinality. The ﬁrst tier is simply that of a ﬁnite set;

for example the set of two integers {0,1} (which is also the basis of a number ﬁeld of ﬁnite

cardinality called the Galois ﬁeld). The next tier is of transﬁnite (i.e. completed inﬁnite)

cardinality and it is the ﬁeld of rational numbers (which of course has the same cardinality

as the counting numbers). This order of cardinality is represented by the symbol ℵ0. Cantor

proved that ℵ0 is not the cardinality of the real numbers and is in fact a smaller quantity

than c the cardinality of the real continuum; in spite of the fact that ℵ0 represents a (literal)

completed inﬁnity.

A subtlety arises with respect to the deﬁnition of the third tier of cardinality due to the

fact that it is not possible to prove whether there exists an order of cardinality ℵ1 such that

5

ℵ0 < ℵ1 < c

where c is the cardinality of the real numbers. One is at liberty to assume the continuum

hypothesis, which asserts that no such number ℵ1 exists, in which case we deﬁne the real

number continuum in terms of three tiers of cardinality (i.e. ﬁnite, transﬁnite order ℵ0

and transﬁnite order c). Alternatively one may consider models of space-time based on a

continuum built up from more than three orders of cardinality in which case one considers

that the number (or numbers) ℵ1 exists. We will consider both possibilities in this paper.

Initially, however, we will work with the continuum hypothesis as a postulate;

Postulate 1; That there exists an isomorphism between the structure of the real number

continuum and the structure of physical space-time which may be represented in terms of

three tiers of cardinality (the continuum hypothesis).

Hypothesis 1; That the fundamental structure of matter and energy in the universe is

related to a deconstruction of the the continuum of space-time.

Hypothesis 1 implies that mass/energy and space-time are made out of the same basic

‘stuﬀ’.

III. AFFINE SET GEOMETRY

We deﬁne aﬃne-set geometry as one in which distances and angles are not deﬁned but

only the shape is manifest. We deﬁne an aﬃne-set as a collection of points interconnected

by lines. A point is always a termination of a line. Multiple lines may terminate at a single

point. No points exist on any line except at the terminations of the line. There are thus

always two and only two points associated with any single line.

Aﬃne-set geometries can be used to model local gauge invariance but their signiﬁcance

in this paper is much broader.

Consider for a moment the common geometric idea of a two-dimensional sub-space of

our three-dimensional real space (time); that is, a two-dimensional plane. Conventionally

we would consider that the physical properties of the continuum (of 3-space) carry over to

6

any two-dimensional sub-space but in fact we don’t really know if this is true (assuming

always that the 3-space of space-time is in fact a real continuum!). The reason we don’t

know is simply because such a space is not empirically accessible. Let us consider this

statement. For a two-dimensional plane to be truely two-dimensional its’ ‘thickness’ must

literally be zero! We can only ever assess the properties of any space indirectly; that is, by

observing the behaviour of a test particle in that space where the continuum of an objects

motion, momentum etc. implies the existence of the continuum property of the underlying

space-time. In the case of a true two-dimensional space (+time) it would require an inﬁnite

amount of energy to conﬁne the wave-function of any massive object to the space so such

observations can never be made. (For example, to compress length contraction to zero we

would need v = c;

′

l

= l

(1 −

s

v2
c2 )

or that the velocity of the massive object reaches the speed of light which is impossible).

Thus we do not know whether such a two-dimensional space would have the continuum

property of the real numbers or not! we simply cannot conﬁne test particle to the space.

The situation with a truely one-dimensional sub-space is even worse for, in addition

to requiring an inﬁnite amount of energy to conﬁne the wave-function of a massive object

to a space of zero transverse dimension, the line would need to be of inﬁnite length to

accommodate it! (It is important here to realise that a quantum object with non-zero rest

mass cannot be squeezed into a point of zero dimension!).

These statements, however, are not necessarily true for massless objects such as photons

and gravitons (although, once again, if they have non-zero energy they cannot be squeezed

into a space of zero dimension; i.e. they cannot be squeezed to a true geometric ‘point’).

One of the central tenets of this work is that any one or two-dimensional sub-space

of our physical 3-space is not in fact a real continuum and that the continuum property

of space-time only exists at the level of three space dimensions. Put another way, such

sub-spaces do not exist! But there is a caveat to this assertion; such sub-spaces may exist

7

as the underpinning of the structure of fundamental particles themselves; not so much as

a kind of ‘internal’ space as a partial ‘deconstruction’ of continuum space. The role that

local gauge invariance will play is to adjust the cardinality of these one and two-dimensional

subspaces, that are postulated to underpin the structure of fundamental matter, to that of

the continuum. The non-observability of any local phase then becomes equivalent to the

unobservable nature of the subspaces ‘building’ the particle structure.

This is the use to which we wish to put aﬃne geometry. Consider the idea of embedding

aﬃne-set geometry into a continuum space; that is, we want to see what the geometrical

consequences are of trying to wed aﬃne-set geometry and continuous geometry.

For example, consider the following two (aﬃne-set) triangles embedded on a continuum

circle;

The two triangles represented by these diagrams are, in aﬃne-set geometry, equivalent.

This is because the side lengths (the three ‘lines’ of the triangle) and the angles subtended

by the lines where they form points are not measurable by deﬁnition for an aﬃne-set. They

do not represent a physical observable. The transformation which takes one into the other

is a local U(1) gauge transformation on the embedding (continuum) circle however as the

vertices shift around the margin of the circle by diﬀerent amounts (by contrast a global

transformation would preserve triangle angles and side lengths). Thus an aﬃne-set triangle

embedded in a circle deﬁnes a U(1) local gauge symmetry in the sense that such a triangle

is invariant under both global and local U(1) gauge transformations only if the geometry

deﬁning the triangle is an aﬃne-set.

In this sense we could in fact use local U(1) gauge

symmetry as an alternative deﬁnition of aﬃne-set geometry (we don’t have to use a triangle

e i θ

(x)

8

of course - we could use any kind of aﬃne-set geometry). For example, from the set (inﬁnite

but countable) ℵ0 of points on the circle we choose an inﬁnite set of sets of points each with

three elements ℵi

3 where the superscript i indicates the (countable) ith set of three points

(the cardinality of this set is of course also ℵ0). Now, assume that each ith set of points is

unique; that is

3 ∩ ℵj
ℵi

3 = 0;

∀ i, j

This deﬁnes an inﬁnite, but countable, set of geometric triangles inscribed within the circle.

Now the transformation which converts any given triangle into any other is always a local

U(1) transformation (global U(1) transformations are a subset of the set of local transfor-

mations). For the total geometry to be invariant with respect to such U(1) transformations

requires that the geometry be aﬃne-set and can be used as a formal deﬁnition.

The union of the sets ℵi

given aﬃne-set triangle. Deﬁne the transformation C i

3 deﬁnes the set of points in the bounding circle1. Let C i
3→C j

3 as C ij

3 then;

3 be a

Σi,j(C ij

3 ) = eiθ(x)

(5)

gives us a compact way of expressing the equivalence of a local gauge transformation and

an aﬃne-set transformation on the circle.

We could add a requirement of ‘smoothness’ to the aﬃne-set transformations to eliminate

singularities produced by vertices ‘crossing-over’ each other in the transformation process

(as two vertices pass each other they deﬁne a line not a triangle). Does equation (5) remain

valid with the elimination of such singularities? Indeed, it would seem that, if θ(x) is required

to be smoothly diﬀerentiable then such transformations must in fact be eliminated and it is

a hidden assumption of eq.(4) that the local phase transformation eiθ(x), like the global one,

is smoothly diﬀerentiable. It is not at all clear if local gauge invariance is maintained if the

transformation is not a smoothly diﬀerentiable manifold!

1treating the circle not as a true continuum of points since cardinality c 6= ℵ0

9

A way of thinking of this is in terms of an order of the points in the circle. Treating the

points in the circle as an ordered set (although inﬁnite) we know that we can still squeeze

or stretch any segment of the circle to an arbitrary degree without changing the order of

the points and thus preserving the diﬀerentiability of the manifold. This follows from the

work of Georg Cantor who proved that there is a one-to-one mapping of the points on any

two ﬁnite length line segments (and indeed onto an inﬁnite length line segment from a ﬁnite

one!). That a global rotation is a one-to-one order-preserving mapping is obvious. It is not

so obvious that this is the case for a local U(1) transformation however since singularities

can be introduced by such a transformation as mentioned.

Aﬃne-set geometries, because the ‘length’ of sides of the geometry can only ever be

deﬁned as ‘unity’, can be represented by discrete group symmetry. Discrete groups can

be ‘spinorial’ or ‘bosonic’ in the sense that they contain (res. do not contain) improper

rotations. An example of an improper rotation in two dimensional space would be;

a

b

c

a

b

c

where the vertices ‘c’ and ‘b’ have interchanged as well as shifted around the circle with

a local U(1) transformation. In this case it is not clear that the transformation could be

represented in the form eiθ(x) with continuously diﬀerentiable θ as the set of transformations

is not one-to-one and onto and not well deﬁned (we would not know, for example, how many

points in the circle are crossing over other points during such a transformations or indeed

if the continuum remained well deﬁned if a (?completed) inﬁnite number of cross-overs

occurred). This is obviously not the case however if the order of the points on the triangle

10

(a,b,c clockwise or anti-clockwise) is preserved since we may deﬁne the transformation in

that case as purely a stretching or compression of the continuum which preserves the order

of all points in the circle. Thus, if we take only the C3 generator of the triangle as being

manifest, and allow it to become a continuous rotation, we could use the aﬃne-set triangle

as a model of a quantum object of integral spin satisfying a local U(1) symmetry invariance.

IV. DECONSTRUCTING SPACE-TIME TO MAKE MATTER

We will do this geometrically by making geometric models of orders of cardinality which

we will then use simultaneously as models of the space-time continuum and as models of

particle structure.

We start with an object to represent the Galois Field of ﬁnite cardinality. This is the

discontinuous set of two digits {0,1} which we may represent as a discrete one-dimensional

interval. Its’ only deﬁnable ‘length’ is 1; in units of itself (i.e.; it is unmeasurable) and the

interval possesses an S2 discrete symmetry because the choice of labelling its’ ends with

the digits 0 and 1 is an arbitrary choice. Only two geometric points are associated with

the interval; those at the terminations of the interval. There are no ‘points’ along the line

itself; this is an aﬃne-set of ﬁnite cardinality (cardinality 2) and the ‘line’ is absolutely

discontinuous. If we embedded such an object in conventional space-time it would have a

true ‘gauge’ invariance in the more literal meaning of the word; that is, it would have the

property of scale invariance. (It is also interesting to note that the S2 generator, expressed

as a continuous geometric symmetry, would render the object as spin 2).

To make a geometric model of the next highest order of cardinality, that of ℵ0, we must

make some further assumptions. Intuitively we might look at the continuum as rather like a

complex structure built up from simpler ‘building blocks’; the simpler building blocks should

underpin the more complex structures. We are working under the assumption that these

‘building blocks’ are the tiers of cardinality implicit in the structure of the continuum. Thus

we want to use the Galois geometry to ‘generate’ a space with cardinality ℵ0. If we regard

11

the Galois geometry as a ‘separation’ of two points the obvious geometric option is to iterate

this process and separate two Galois intervals to create a two-dimensional space bounded

by Galois intervals. Such a process can deﬁne (at least) two types of objects; triangles and

squares each object bounded by discontinuous Galois intervals. We now assume that the

two-dimensional space contained within the bounding intervals has the cardinality ℵ0.

Finally to create a model of the continuum we iterate the process again. This allows

us to generate cubes, tetrahedrons etc. The contained space is assumed to be a geometric

representation of the real number continuum whilst the boundaries of the geometries remain

discontinuous. Of course, no time dimension is deﬁned by this procedure; only a three

dimensional continuous but ﬁnite space is deﬁned contained ‘within’ the boundary of the

deﬁning geometry. Let us call these three-dimensional geometries ‘Cantor’ geometries.

V. OVERVIEW OF PHENOMENOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE

GEOMETRY LINKED TO LOCAL GAUGE INVARIANCE

Hypothesis 2 That the Galois interval is the geometry of the graviton.

Hypothesis 3 That the Cantor triangle is the geometry of the photon.

Hypothesis 4 That the Cantor cube is the geometry of a quark.

Hypothesis 5 That the Cantor tetrahedron is the geometry of a lepton.

Hypothesis 6 The boundary of an object constitutes its’ associated gauge ﬁelds.

Hypothesis 7 Any geometry deﬁning a real-continuum of space has a mass speciﬁed by

the symmetry of the object.

Hypothesis 8 Objects which do not deﬁne an intrinsic continuum to be embedded in

space-time must elevate their cardinality to that of the continuum.

The are compelling empirical reasons for making these identiﬁcations as we shall see

but at this stage our chief motivation is to account for nature’s obsession with local gauge

invariance.

Hypothesis 7 is the basis of rest mass calculations. We will form matrix representations of

12

the symmetry groups implied by the aﬃne-set; which in general is a permutation symmetry

of a labelling of the points of the set. We will then sum over all matrix elements needed

to describe the geometry, and, in the case of the strong interaction, any matrix elements

describing the geometry of the interaction, and form ratios of particle masses by taking

ratios of sums of matrix elements.

In summary we have assumed that the continuum of space-time has a complex structure

in terms of tiers of cardinality and that material objects in the universe are a reﬂection of

that structure. Time must be assumed to exist outside the boundaries of the geometries

in question and may be added as an additional hypothesis if desired (which is reasonable

given that the existence of time is always assumed in any physical theory!). We could

alternatively deﬁne time in terms of a relationship between diﬀerent geometries embedded

in a larger three-dimensional space. The time dimension is of course assumed to satisfy the

continuum criteria. However, the cardinality of four-dimensional space-time is not assumed

to be diﬀerent from that of the three-dimensional space as deﬁned above (in section XI we

will look at alternative models of the continuum where this latter assumption does not hold).

More particularly the sequence of geometric construction must be viewed as the gener-

ation of space-time itself. Thus we do not view the Galois interval geometry as an object

embedded in space-time but rather, in combination with the two and three-dimensional ge-

ometries, as the generator of space-time itself. The time-propagating Galois interval will

‘sweep-out’ a sheet of two-dimensional space. Curvature of this ‘swept-out’ space would

then be suﬃcient to elevate the cardinality of the generated space to that of the continuum

under the continuum hypothesis (viz. postulate 1). However, the one-dimensional Galois

interval, which we have identiﬁed with the graviton, does not have a continuum structure

itself; nor does the ‘swept-out’ sheet of two-dimensional space produced by its’ propagation.

Only the ﬁnal three-dimensional generated space has the continuum property.

These hypotheses contain a lot of interesting implications. Firstly we note that, since

all geometries have Galois intervals in their boundaries, all geometries, including the photon

and the graviton itself (by hypothesis 6), have gravitons as an associated ﬁeld and ‘feel’,

13

and are the source of, gravitation.

An object such as a Cantor tetrahedron must be electro-magnetically charged since it has

a photon (gauge ﬁeld) in its boundary (i.e. cantor triangles in its’ boundary). Let us look at

this geometry from the perspective of local gauge invariance. The Galois intervals deﬁning

the Cantor tetrahedron are by deﬁnition unmeasurable by any observer. The terminations

of the intervals can be anywhere in space leading to a ﬁeld theory rather than a theory of a

point particle. However, there is an inbuilt paradox in the theory because the time dimension

cannot be deﬁned within the interior of the tetrahedron; which leads to the object behaving

like a geometric point in scattering experiments. In other words, the Cantor tetrahedron is

a three-dimensional space object embedded in a four-dimensional space-time. No observer

probe can penetrate the timeless interior space of the Cantor tetrahedron (all observations

occur in time!) which will always appear smaller than the wavelength of any probe.

Of particular interest is the boundary between the timeless three-dimensional space in the

interior of the Cantor tetrahedron and the four-dimensional space-time outside the boundary

of the tetrahedron.

In the case of the Cantor tetrahedron this boundary is composed of

Cantor triangles and Galois intervals deﬁning these triangles. These are the postulated

geometries of the photon and graviton respectively. Because of the unmeasurable nature of

the ‘lengths’ of these intervals their terminations can be anywhere in space and interaction

with them will be probabilistic; they will manifest as ﬁelds in space-time (by hypothesis

respectively the electro-magnetic and gravitational ﬁelds of the Cantor tetrahedron). By

virtue of the fact that these bounding geometries in turn deﬁne the Cantor tetrahedron so

too the Cantor tetrahedron will have the schizophrenic identity of both a non-local ﬁeld and

a geometric point under observation. This is a perfect candidate for a quantum ﬁeld.

One obtains the concept of local gauge invariance under the more demanding hypothesis

8. Hypothesis 8 is a very natural requirement. In essence it demands that only the continuum

is an observable. The space contained within the boundary of the Cantor triangle is NOT

a continuum by deﬁnition (it has cardinality ℵ0 not c) and thus is not an observable space.

Its lack of observability is satisﬁed physically if it propagates at the speed of light so that

14

the contained space of the Cantor triangle cannot be placed in the same inertial frame as

any observer. Thus the Cantor triangle will always generate a three-dimensional space with

respect to any observer by virtue of its relative motion suﬃcient to deﬁne a continuum space

as required for physical existence under hypothesis 8. The astute reader will have realised

that this requirement is equivalent to the principle of special relativity if one identiﬁes the

Cantor triangle with the photon.

A ﬂat two-dimensional square, the model for an electron neutrino in this schema, has no

triangle in it’s boundary and is thus not electro-magnetically charged. (It nevertheless has

a piece of phase information in its’ boundary which induces a weak interaction gauge ﬁeld

as we will later see - we will also look at the issue of diﬀerent generations of quarks and

leptons later).

The principle of special relativity emerges quite naturally from this schema viz. hy-

potheses 3 and 8. If a triangle is a photon then, to exist in space-time, postulate 8 tells

us that it must propagate in time to ‘sweep-out’ a three dimensional space to deﬁne a real

continuum. To be deﬁned geometrically in this schema it must sweep out a bounded space

- which means its’ velocity must be ﬁnite relative to cubes and tetrahedrons but never zero.

If one adds relative motion between diﬀerent cubes and or diﬀerent tetrahedrons in a larger

space-time embedding then it follows that the photon’s velocity relative to any given cube

or tetrahedron is always a ﬁnite constant. Of course the same must apply to the Galois

interval - the model of the graviton in this schema - it must propagate in time and sweep

out a volume to exist; but it does not have to propagate at the same velocity as the photon!

e i θ

(x)

15

It may of course do so but there is no prima facia reason in this geometry why a graviton

must propagate at the speed of light.

A cube in this schema satisﬁes hypothesis 7 and so should represent an object with a

non-zero rest mass. By postulate 3 it should not carry an EM charge but this is under

the assumption that the six 4-vertex faces of the cube are two dimensional squares rather

that three-dimensional tetrahedrons; allowing for the latter includes the possibility that the

cube can carry unit or fractional charge in addition to being uncharged. In the scheme that

follows all permutations allowed by the symmetry appear to manifest physically.

VI. SPINS AND OTHER THINGS

Hypothesis 9 Discrete symmetry groups speciﬁed by any given geometry manifest as an

analogous continuous symmetry when the time dimension is added to the space in which

the geometry is embedded by virtue of the generators of the discrete group being converted

into continuous rotation generators of the corresponding continuous group.

Thus the S2 symmetry of the Galois interval becomes a continuous spin 2 geometry with

the addition of a time dimension. (It can only be spin 2 because the symmetry generator

of the interval - a reﬂection - is invariant with a rotation by π). The triangle becomes a

spin 1 object because the discrete symmetry group of a triangle, C3, has a generator axis

orthogonal to the plane of the triangle whose sign changes with rotation by π and is unity

under a rotation by 2π. For the case of the tetrahedron we will take as its’ symmetry group,

rather than the 24 element group Td, the unique dihedral subgroup of SU(2) which has 24

elements and two generators. In the continuum limit this becomes SU(2). (The generators

of the dihedral group are only two in number but of the three generators of SU(2) only two

are linearly independent

[τi, τj] = −iǫ k

ij τk).

Hypothesis 10

The mass of a three-dimensional object is found by extracting the time dimension from

the embedding space and is the cardinality of the corresponding discrete symmetry group

16

that remains after the extraction (modulo any radiative corrections and adjustments for the

generators).

Thus, in the case of the tetrahedron, extracting the time dimension means removing

the dihedral generators and the associated group elements of SU(2) apart from a residual

discrete collection of 22 elements which represent the rest mass of the tetrahedron. (Of course

removing the time dimension can only deﬁne a rest mass and cannot deﬁne a dynamical mass

because the latter is meaningless in a timeless space! What we obtain is a deﬁnition of the

mass of an object at rest irrespective of the lifetime of the object; this may or may not be

a measurable quantity! Only in the situation where the lifetime of the object is inﬁnite will

it be precisely measurable!).

components of the ﬁelds;

For a Dirac mass term in standard theory we have coupling of the left and right handed

and in the limit of zero mass the left and right handed ﬁelds decouple;

Lmass = g ¯ψLψRφ

iγµ∂µψR = mψL

(6)

(7)

The geometric meaning of this in the schema being presented here can be understood by

considering the photon geometry (hypothesis 3) even though it is not a fermion. The triangu-

lar boundary of the geometry is constructed of three gravitons (in the limit of instantaneous

time) but the gravitational gauge ﬁeld ‘smoothes’ this out so that the local triangular phase

of the geometry is not an observable. The geometry is then best represented by a circular

two-dimensional disc with a ‘fuzzy’ margin and the geometry C3 generator as the continuous

U(1) generator of the circle. The left and right handed orientations of the generator (with

respect to the direction of motion of the object) are distinct and, because of hypothesis 8,

cannot be combined to form a three-dimensional volume for the photon at rest with respect

to an object such as a tetrahedron or cube. This means that the photon must be massless

(the photon may have ﬁnite radiative corrections from is gravitational gauge ﬁeld which in-

duce a non-zero minimum energy for the photon but its’ rest-mass must nevertheless always

17

be zero). Note that in this pictorial model the non-‘fuzzy’ part of the ‘disc’ is a quantised

space which will always appear smaller than any probe (in the case of a photon the only

‘probe’ would be a graviton); it is not a measurable space. The ‘fuzz’ is due the associated

gravitational ﬁeld of the photon and, in principle, extends transversely out to inﬁnity.

Thus the meaning of a term like g ¯ψLψRφ is that the left and right handed compo-

nents only combine in the context of a three-dimensional space geometry and that a two-

dimensional (or one-dimensional) object in this schema must always have zero rest mass.

Similarly, any spinor geometry whose contained space deﬁnes an intrinsic continuum, such

as a cube or a tetrahedron, will have a Dirac mass.

This is, however, not the complete picture since we will have to add radiative corrections

to any Dirac mass due to the fact that the boundary of the electron geometry (by hypothesis

that of the tetrahedron) contains photons and gravitons - which must propagate by hypoth-

esis 8 to be deﬁned properly and in so doing will generate additional components of particle

mass. In QFT these contributions are inﬁnite due to integration over momentum space but

in the present geometric picture they must be strictly ﬁnite because the analogue of the ‘bare’

mass in the geometric picture is the order of the underlying discrete group (not including

generators); which is strictly ﬁnite. (The analogue of an inﬁnite ‘bare’ mass would be the

order of the corresponding continuous group; but we can eliminate this by throwing away

all the elements other than those which represent the real underlying discrete symmetry).

Thus in the case of the three-dimensional tetrahedron in O(3,1) space-time the continuous

group is SU(2) of inﬁnite order but the real mass of the Dirac term is represented by the 24

discrete sub-group elements modulo the two generators of this discrete group left as massless

intrinsic spin generators.

The reader at this stage may be concerned that no mass units are speciﬁed! How can

you have a mass of 22? The answer is that all masses are a relative thing. So, for example, if

we deﬁne the rest mass of the proton as ‘1’ all other masses could be deﬁned in terms of this

unit. Ultimately a unit like a Kg can be expressed in terms of the summed mass of a certain

number of nucleons and electrons, modulo binding energies, at a certain temperature. This,

18

in turn, could be expressed solely in terms of proton masses (provided we know the binding

energies, Mp/Mn and Mp/Me mass ratios etc). The beauty of deﬁning mass in terms of

proton or electron rest mass is that, as far as we know, these are the only two (?absolutely)

stable massive colourless fermions. Using the ∆E∆t ≥ ¯h relation means that, at least in

principle, we can measure the mass of a stable object to any desired level of accuracy. In

the situation at hand what we are really interested in is calculating quantities such as the

rest-mass ratio of the proton to the electron which we shall do by performing a similar

calculation for the proton that we have performed for the tetrahedron (here a model of the

electron - we will deal with muons and taus later).

Notice that the approach to particle structure and groups being employed here is fun-

damentally diﬀerent to that of the standard model; the SM symmetry involves relations

between diﬀerent types particles by assuming the spectrum of particles is governed by some

symmetry group rather than the intrinsic structure of a given particle being governed by a

symmetry group; the latter is what we are doing here. Notice also that there is no conﬂict

between the model of a charged lepton (here a tetrahedron) being built up here and the

empirical ﬁnding that leptons appear to be point particles in deep inelastic scattering ex-

periments. The reason is that time exists only ‘outside’ the boundary of the tetrahedron -

there is no time in the ‘interior space’ of the tetrahedron and hence no dynamics can occur

in the interior space which is a three-space not a four-dimensional space-time. Observations

of the lepton involve interactions with its’ boundary only and the ‘interior space’ has no

measurable size. Experiment can only detect the presence of this 3-space in an on/oﬀ sense;

the lepton is either detected or it is not. Exactly the same applies to the 2-space deﬁned

by the photon; the photon can only be probed with regard to its’ boundary gravitational

ﬁeld and the interior space is unmeasurable apart from the sense that it’s existence can be

equilibrated with detection of the photon.

By the same token, because the boundaries of the (timeless) contained spaces are them-

selves gauge quanta, the boundaries of the geometries will represent propagating ﬁelds and

thus the whole geometry will represent a ﬁeld quanta rather than a static geometric point

19

in space-time. The boundaries of geometries such as aﬃne-set tetrahedrons are thus in this

sense non-local in this schema and represent the gauge quanta of the object. A spinorial

tetrahedron in this model represents an electron. The gauge quanta (in the case of the tetra-

hedron the triangular faces and individual lines of the boundary of the geometry) eliminate

any observable local phase associated with the boundary of the geometry (‘smoothing-out’

the triangles and intervals) by propagating in space time and by sweeping-out an associated

3-space elevate the cardinality of the boundary of the geometry to the continuum. The

aﬃne-set tetrahedron may be idealised as a three-dimensional timeless fuzz-ball embedded

in a four-dimensional space-time with the surface ‘fuzz’, extending out to inﬁnity, being

the propagating gauge quanta represented by the surface of the geometry propagating at

the speed of light. The ‘interior’ time-less space is impenetrable and will always appear

smaller that the wavelength of any probe which, by the very nature of a dynamical probe,

is constrained to lie within the boundaries of the time dimension and cannot enter the 3-

space which deﬁnes the underlying geometry. Thus the tetrahedron always appears as a

point particle in deep inelastic scattering experiments. This is the link to eqn.(4); the non-

observability of local phase arises because one and two-dimensional sub-spaces of continuum

3-space do not represent a real continuum and are not accessible to observation. Intrinsic

particle spin in the model is then a necessary prerequisite for the existence of a fundamental

quantum object in space-time which leads to trouble incorporating a scalar Higgs in the

theory (needed as a ‘free’ particle to preserve unitarity for radiative corrections in the SM

for example). We will look at this issue again towards the end of the paper but note at this

stage that, whilst it appears we cannot express the Higgs as a free-particle in space-time in

this model as so far developed, we can give it physical existence in one space; the interior

timeless 3-space of a geometry such as an aﬃne cantor tetrahedron. Indeed, we might seek

to identify the 3-space (minus the boundary of the tetrahedron) as the Higgs ﬁeld itself.

This is in fact the route we will take. The Higgs ﬁeld will be ‘buried outside time’.

VII. CUBES, QUARKS AND FRACTIONAL CHARGE

By hypothesis we identify the Cantor cube with a quark. We will be concerned here

with derivation of the proton and neutron masses so we will require a representation theory

that encompasses three quarks and the associated gluon ﬁeld. The following components

are calculated in sequence;

1; constituent quark mass

2; gluon energy associated with the constituent quarks

3; current quark masses

4; gluon energy associated speciﬁcally with the current quarks.

The constituent quark mass represents the energy associated with the momentum of

the quarks and in the nucleons we will ﬁnd that it represents about one-half of the total

mass of the nucleon. The gluon energy, 2 above, represents the energy associated with the

momentum of the gluons and again will be found to represent about one-half of the total

energy of the nucleon. The current quark mass is a diﬀerent component and represents the

intrinsic rest-mass energy of the individual quarks. Component 4 is something of a mystery

but appears to be rather like an instantaneous strong-force analogue of the instantaneous

Coulomb interaction. It might be viewed as a potential energy of separation of the current

quarks at the energy scale of the calculation.

To study the symmetry properties of the Cantor cube geometry we will need a represen-

tation theory which is given below. The details are somewhat more involved than in the case

of the Cantor tetrahedron but an essential summary of the ideas is as follows. Hypothesis

8 requires the propagation (at light speed) of all boundaries that do not deﬁne a rest mass

(which means any geometry that is one or two-dimensional) and hypothesis 9 means that the

cube boundary will have a complex structure. Hypothesis 8 will mean that a ﬂat square ge-

ometry must be massless; when conﬁned to a colour space (deﬁned below) this will manifest

as a massless spin-1 object (i.e. as a gluon) and the representation theory speciﬁes that the

cubes are fractionally charged but massive. (The fractional charge results from triangulation

21

of a fractional part of the boundary of the cube; geometrically this means that some of the

square surfaces of the cube become a 3-space rather than a 2-space so that the geometry

becomes a tetrahedron rather than a square - the charge of the cube is then represented by

the fraction of the topology that is triangulated. The group theory is such that opposite

square faces of the cube always triangulate in tandem so that the possible fractional charges

are ± 1

3 and ± 2

3 with the sign dependent on the orientation of the C3 generator).

Essentially all phase information with regard to the boundary of any geometry is elimi-

nated by the gauge ﬁelds; the position and direction in space of the vertices and edges of the

geometry are not an observable. In the case of a cube the overall ‘cube’ phase information

is its’colour and the three axes of the colour may be taken as the three (not necessarily

orthogonal in real space but orthogonal in aﬃne-set geometry!) lines running through the

centre of opposing ‘square’ faces of the cube. (Observation of the colour of a cube would be

analogous to removing the intrinsic spin of a quark or freeze-framing the object by removing

the time dimension).

We begin by forming a representation for a spinorial version of a tetrahedral geometry

which will form the basis for a representation theory of the cubic geometry. The tetrahedron

has special discrete symmetry; a symmetry related to the 24=4! elements of a permutation

of its vertices. For a spinorial version embedded in a 4-dimensional space-time we seek the

unique sub-group of SU(2) with 24 elements which is;

unity; square roots, fourth roots and sixth roots. These elements close to form a group with

24 elements which we shall designate Tr. The generators of the group may be taken as the

γ4 and δ4 matrices. Note that;

(γ4.δ4)2 = (δ4.γ4)2 = −I2

(9)

so that, since SU2 is a double covering of SO3 up to a sign, the square of the product of

the generators represents a rotation by 2π so that the Tr group is a kind of discrete spinor

23

group. It is analogous to the geometric group Td familiar to physical chemists which is the

group of the tetrahedron in three-dimensions with 24 elements and 2 generators. Td is a

point space group in three dimensions which is spinorial but is not isomorphic to Tr.

The Tr group will be used as the fundamental form of a discrete representation for spinor

particles in the theory.

The rest mass of Tr is deﬁned as R.(4! − 2) where (4!-2) is the number of non-generator

elements in the group and R incorporates any radiative corrections due to the elevation

of the cardinality of the boundary of the geometry to the continuum by the gauge ﬁelds.

In any continuous ﬁeld theory analogue the discrete pair of Tr generators must become

continuous rotations and by hypothesis manifest as the intrinsic spin of the geometry; this

is the reason for deﬁning them as massless. The hypothesis of massless group generators is

testable by comparing resulting mass calculations with experiment over a variety of particle

types. The best experimental evidence for the correctness of this assumption comes from the

massive charged leptons which all have identical Tr group elements with identical radiative

corrections in their mass expressions.

VIII. EMBEDDING TR IN SU(3)

To calculate mass expressions for cube geometries, which by hypothesis we equate with

quarks, requires a matrix representation of the symmetry group of the cube that parallels

that developed for the tetrahedron.

We can mirror the root structure of SU(3) by embedding three copies of SU(2) in SU(3).

We can embed three copies of the Tr group as follows;

r =

0 λ11 λ12

0 1 0

; b =

The three ‘colour’ matrices r, g and b plus the ‘colour-dual’ basis ¯r, ¯g and ¯b together form a

discrete version of the group of SU(3)c. Also notice that each set of colour matrices forms

a group with 24 elements. The ‘dual’ or ‘colour-bar’ matrices do not form a group since

the product of any two colour-bar matrices is a colour matrix. However, the combination of

ci + ¯ci (for colour index i) forms a group with 48 elements and two generators located in the

colour-bar set of elements. Let us call this group Tc. It is also a ‘discrete spinor’ since the

generators are analogous to the Tr group;

(iγ4.iδ4)2 = −I2

(12)

Note that the colour-dual is not the same as the Hermitian conjugate matrix.

We could consider Tc group as a model for a Skyrmion ﬁeld of charge 4 i.e. one with

cubic symmetry. We will see later how the geometric analogy works but to obtain a picture

think of the three colours as represented by the three pairs of opposite faces of the cube; one

pair of faces representing the Tc group with the four vertices of each square face representing

each tetrahedral sub-group. To represent the total geometry we form a ‘particle vector’

which is composed of three components. First form a matrix representation of Tc as follows;

R = 

and then form the three-component particle vector

→
P = (R, G, B). (Of course the order of

the components here is arbitrary).

Now deﬁne the following ‘current-quark’ operators;

Two things need mentioning at this stage; 1; the quark operators qi and Ii are assumed

conﬁned to their respective colour space i; that is, the qr operators only operate on the R

matrix etc, and 2; the order of the application of the operators does not change the result; so

long as each operator colour is represented only once (that is DgUrUb gives the same result

as UgDrUb etc).

IX. GLUE

The gluon geometry is represented by a four-vertex ﬂat (and hence massless) spin-one

geometry related to the boundary of the cube (the sign of the C4 generator of the ﬂat square

geometry changes sign with a rotation by π so that the continuous analogue must be a

spin-one generator). There are six colour states deﬁned directly from the cube geometry;

R, ¯R, B, ¯B, G and ¯G. (The remaining generators of SU(3) are linear combinations of these).

We can form a representation theory for the gluons and we ﬁnd that their energy equivalence

is constrained by the symmetry allowing their contribution to the rest mass of particles to

be estimated by summing over the possible matrix representations in the same way as was

done for the Tr and Tc groups. There will be an implicit assumption in such a summation

that αs = 1 because we will equate the energy equivalence of one matrix element of the glue

with that of the constituent quarks. In fact this choice is the only one possible since they

are calculated from the same basis groups and particle vector.

X. RADIATIVE CORRECTIONS

As was suggested earlier in the text bare mass is to be interpreted as the transformation

of a geometry over a timeless space or, equivalently, as a symmetry which represents such a

transformation. Actually, apart from the absence of the time dimension, this is remarkably

like the deﬁnition of energy associated with the momentum of a moving object for the motion

of an object is nothing other than its’ translation over a space in a deﬁnable time. Mass

and translational energy thus have a similar structure! For the Tr group, which represents

a discrete spinorial tetrahedron, there are 24 discrete elements or transformations over its

contained (timeless!) 3-space. We have made the assumption that the two generators of

the geometry generate its intrinsic spin (in the transition to a ﬁeld theory) and that these

generators are as a consequence massless. The Dirac mass of the tetrahedral group would

then be given as;

28

massTr = (4! − 2)

(22)

Eqn.(22) is a ﬁnite bare mass. It will be modiﬁed by the electro-magnetic properties of the

boundary of the geometry. In standard theory component (22) must be generated by the

Higgs ﬁeld.

That the radiative correction from electro-magnetism to the mass of an object such as

an electron must be ﬁnite and of order α was, I believe, pointed out by Dirac and has been

emphasised by authors such as Sakurai [2] . The reason is that, for the electro-magnetic

contribution δm to contribute most of the mass of the electron m, the energy of the virtual

photons ∆ must exceed the mass of the entire universe!

δm =

3αm
2π

log

∆
m (cid:27)

(cid:26)

If the E.M. contributions are of order α{Mbare} and ﬁnite then Mbare must also be ﬁnite!

Of course in the perturbative approach both Mbare and the radiative correction are inﬁnite

and the coupling, αem varies with the photon momentum which is integrated over. The

inﬁnities are present even if the momentum integrations are regularized with a cut-oﬀ.

By contrast in the current non-perturbative approach we have a ﬁnite ‘bare’ Dirac mass.

Now, because in the geometric picture presented the gauge ﬁelds are compressed onto the

boundary of the geometry, we expect on basic symmetry grounds that if the Dirac mass can

be calculated from the discrete geometry then so should the radiative corrections! (It might

be argued that this is a rather loose argument though!) The basic symmetry argument is as

follows. There are four triangles on the surface of the geometry and each has a permutation

symmetry of 3!=6 elements. Four times six equals twenty-four so the surface of the geometry,

in terms of photons as triangle aﬃne-sets, has a group order equal to that of the tetrahedron.

We assume however that any mass-equivalence is reduced from unity to the coupling strength

of the force and that the amount of energy that the surface triangles can express is exactly

equal to the bare mass of the tetrahedron because of the equivalence of the order of the two

sets (we assume that the bare mass is converted to the photon energy and that the coupling

strength αem is then set at this level).

29

The simplest and most natural possible ansat¨z is then given by;

massTr = (4! − 2)(1 + α(q2=m2))

(23)

where α is the ﬁne structure constant deﬁned at the (ﬁnite!) bare-mass energy m of the

particle in question. We do not integrate over photon momentum! We do not use a range

of values of αem but only that value set at the energy scale of the underlying (ﬁnite) bare

mass. The validity of this ansat¨z depends on experimental testing. We will see shortly that

it is accurate to within current experimental limits. Note that this radiative correction is

NOT perturbative.

We next generalise this ansat¨z to the weak interaction to accommodate weak radiative

corrections to the lepton mass deﬁned by eqn.(23) under similar assumptions by adding;

massTr = (4! − 2)(1 + α(q2=m2) + Gf )

(24)

where Gf is a weak interaction correction expressed as a dimensionless number in terms of

relative strength in comparison to the E.M. force i.e. Gf ≈ 10−5. We will symbolise the

radiative correction as;

R = (1 + αem + Gf )

But what is the value of the strong coupling for the quarks? Comparison with experiment

will show that, for the discrete non-perturbative geometric approach, it always takes the

value unity (in dimensionless ‘relative strength’ terms).

In conventional QCD only the

asymptotic ‘free’ region of phase space is accessible to perturbative calculations and the low-

energy region presents diﬃculties (lattice approaches etc). Actually there is no inconsistency

in ﬁnding that the coupling always takes the value unity for aﬃne-set calculations; if we are

not looking at a quark we really don’t know what it is doing! And if we are measuring the

rest mass of a proton (ultimately what we are trying to calculate here) then we deﬁnitely

don’t know what the quarks are up to for such a measurement at rest energy! There are

basic symmetry reasons why the coupling should be unity in the aﬃne-set regime (it has

30

been called the ‘leggo-block’ approach) based on the idea of ‘stacking’ cubes and taking the

interaction energy in terms of the energy equivalence of the contacting faces. Because this

energy is expressed as unaltered matrix elements the coupling is automatically unity! We

will not explore the issue further but assume that, for systems containing quarks only, the

identity in the factor R is an expression of αstrong.

Because the model of quarks developed in the previous section is based on units of the

Tr group we will make identical assumptions about the mass equivalence of respective Tc

mass units; that is, we will equate the mass with the sum of matrix elements. We can write

each 6 × 6 Tc matrix two ways;

Ci 0

0 ¯Cj













or 

¯Ci 0

0 Cj











(25)

These two possible forms of Tc represent opposite parity assignments and the two generators

of the Tc group occur only in the barred matrix. As before we assume that these generators,

in the continuum limit, generate the continuous intrinsic spin of the geometry and are

massless. The two matrices above will thus generate, for a single colour, 2.24.22 elements

of mass as a result. Now, summing over three colours gives a multiplier of 3 and there

are 3! possible permutations of colour order in the particle vector. Thus the total number

of possible diﬀerent matrix elements in an ordered particle vector (with E.M. and weak

radiative corrections) is;

3.3!.2.24.22(1 + αem + Gf ) = 6.4!.6.(4! − 2)(1 + αem + Gf )

(26)

Notice that in eq.(26) a gauge ﬁeld correction identical to that for the Tr group has been

added; the radiative corrections are based on the tetrahedral geometry and Tc is just a sum

of such tetrahedral geometries each of which has its boundary ‘smoothed’ by the appropriate

gauge ﬁeld with identical corrections to mass as for the Tr group. It is reasonable to take the

value αem in eq.(26) as the low energy value because the current quark masses are small for

the ﬁrst generation (N.B. Tc does not deﬁne the current quark masses - it deﬁnes constituent

31

quark energy-momentum). Notice also that Gf has been coupled to both the right and left-

hand parts of the particle vector (expression(25) describes opposite parity states) as was the

case for the coupling for the Tr group. If one wished one could couple a value 2Gf to half

the mass, as a means of representing the parity violating nature of the weak interaction, but

the result would be the same so we will stick with the current notation.

Notice also that in (26) the R.H.S. has an interpretation in terms of a cubic geometry

with six 4-point geometric surfaces. This analogy will be reinforced later. The double

counting implicit here (we have the square of the surface order of the cube; the surface order

being 6.4! - for six four-point subgeometries - or 6.(4!-2) depending on whether generators

are included) is a reﬂection of the dual nature of the Tc which is spinorial and results in a

double counting of the geometry surface. Mass (26) will represent the constituent mass of a

cubic baryon.

To calculate the corresponding gluon constituent mass we notice that each gluon operator

contains the product Ci.C †

j neither of which contains the Tc generator pair. The order of this

product is thus 242. For a given three-component particle vector there are three possible

couplings of colour exchange; ﬁrst component and second, second and third and ﬁrst and

third. This triples the gluon order quite independent of the particle vector. For the particle

vector there are three cyclic permutations which cannot be interconverted with the exchange

of a single gluon resulting in a further tripling of the gluon order. The gluon has two active

colour component in its particle vector analogue and there is a second doubling of the order

that arises from coupling to the two diﬀerent formats in eq.(25). Thus the net gluon matrix

order is;

gluons

2.2.3.3.242 = 6.4!.6.4!

(27)

which again has ready interpretation in terms of the surface of a cube.

We can now sum the Tr equivalent order for the basic cubic geometry;

cubic mass = {6.4!.6(4! − 2) + 6.4!.6.4!}.(1 + α + Gf )

(28)

32

Notice that a radiative correction R containing αem + Gf has been added to the gluon

energy in (28)! This seems completely out of place; an explanation is given later in the text.

XI. CURRENT QUARK MASSES

We ﬁrst examine the current quark content of the proton. The current quarks are built

up from the quark operators used previously to deﬁne the particle types. The current quark

masses are the corresponding masses of these operators plus an extra piece that represents

either (ﬁnite) gluon radiative corrections to the current quark masses or a potential energy

of separation of the current quarks - we really are not sure quite which!

The glue and quark masses calculated in the previous section are related to gluon and

quark energy-momentum due to the dynamical motion of these objects in the hadron. In

this section we calculate the self-mass of individual quarks; this is the current quark mass.

We ﬁrst study the operator component of mass of the current quarks. The glue cor-

rections are less well understood. Our aim here is to extract the Tr equivalent order (i.e.

number of Tr equivalent matrix representations) of the quark operators in the previous sec-

tions. We can split up the operators into two pieces; which is convenient for calculations.

Each current quark operator consists of a vector composed of 3 square 6 × 6 matrices. Each

6 × 6 block is composed of two 3×3 blocks on the diagonal. We separate out the upper 3×3

blocks as one set of matrices and the lower 3×3 set of blocks as another and represent them

as follows (the representation below is for the proton as the reader can conﬁrm by applying

the operators to the particle vector);

strong component =

q∗ I I

, E.M. component =

(29)











The rows of these matrices are the three colours (order red, green and blue in the notation

used in this paper from top down) and the columns are the type of quark; the left hand and

central column of each matrix above is an up-type quark and the right hand column is a

33

down-type quark. The up-type quarks have their colour deﬁned by the colour of the single

identity they carry. Thus for example the ﬁrst column of these matrices represents a red up

quark. The single q or q* in the down deﬁnes its colour so that the last column above is a

blue down quark.

The strong components couples to the C colour matrix of the particle vector which

does not contain any generators. The E.M. component couples to the ¯C matrix with two

generators. (This coupling is required to properly deﬁne the charge characteristic of the

particle in the given representation). The order of a C matrix is 24 elements. The order of a

¯C matrix is (4!-2) elements. The masses of the current quark operators are deﬁned in terms

of the matrices to which they couple. The exception to the rule applies to the identities

in the E.M. component which are spinless and of order 4! (i.e. the generators of ¯C are

massive under the identity components of the current quarks - the I or the I components).

The identities in the strong component act like ‘strong charges’ and carry a relative mass

sign. For example, in the left hand matrix of (29) the two identities cancel the two script

identities leaving only the net 5 q*’s to contribute to the strong component mass.

It is then a simple matter to calculate the basic current quark masses in a proton; these

can be read straight oﬀ expression (29). There are 5 components in the proton strong-

interaction current quark part and each couples to a C matrix of order 4! The 4 identities

in the E.M. component have mass 4.4! and, after the cancellation of a q and q* in the E.M.

component (these are considered to be opposite charges) we are left with 3.(4!-2) as the

order of the 3 q*’s in the E.M. component. There is a doubling of order due to the fact that

the particle vector has two parity permutations as indicated earlier in the text (C, ¯C) and

( ¯C, C);

Proton current quark Tr equivalent order = 2{9.4! + 3.(4! − 2)}(1 + αem + Gf )

(30)

where the same kind of radiative gauge ﬁeld correction as was done for the other components

is given. This radiative correction might seem appropriate for the charged components

(the q’s) but seems inappropriate for the scalar identities which are related to the strong

34

interaction not the electro-magnetic interaction. We will apply a (1 + αem) correction to

currrent quark mass generated by both the identity (no em charge) parts of (29) and (31)

and the q and q∗ parts just as an em radiative correction was applied to the constituent gluon

energy in (28) in relation to (27). Some justiﬁcation for this is found later in the text but it

is quite speculative. The best that can otherwise be said at this stage is that this approach

seems to work in all examples so far studied with this technique (which includes a variety of

mesons). Ultimately, however, this situation is quite unsatisfactory and an understanding of

the radiative corrections to this theory of masses is one of its’ most important outstanding

problems.

For the neutron the calculation is analogous. The appropriate matrices which deﬁne a

colourless electrically-neutral fermion are;

strong component =

q∗ q∗ I

where it is implicit that the strong component is coupling the the C matrices of the particle

vector and that the E.M. component is coupling to the ¯C components. From these one can

read-oﬀ the mass terms applying exactly the same rules as before;

Neutron current quark Tr equivalent order = 2.{12.4!}(1 + αem + Gf )

(32)

One can use eq’s (30) and (32) to estimate the up and down quark current masses but

the calculation is yet incomplete because there remains yet another component - the ω

component in the table at the beginning of section XII - whose origin is something of a

mystery. This is calculated precisely in the next section. When this is combined with the

above results very precise calculations of the up and down current quark masses can be made.

It must be born in mind, however, that these masses change somewhat according to context;

they are not exactly the same, for example, in a pion as a nucleon. We will not calculate the

pion mass in this paper although the calculation follows the same basic principles given here

and values within empirical limits are obtained; in fact the whole spectrum of ground state

35

spin-0 meson masses can be calculated but there is considerable complexity in calculations

involving higher-generation quarks which will not be discussed in this paper.

The above table lists the glue corrections for current quark masses for the three gen-

erations. (Why they have been called U(1) components will be discussed later). The glue

corrections for the up and down quarks in the nucleons can be calculated from the strong

components in expressions (29) for the proton and (31) for the neutron by ‘rotating’ the

strong component to couple to the generators and setting αs = 1. (This ‘rotation’ is an

induced phase change when they are moved from the left to right hand matrix in (29) and

A much easier way to consider the current-quark glue corrections is with the leggo ap-

proach. Take two Cantor cubes and stack them;

36

now, there are only 11 4-point sub-geometries in this structure rather than the 12 in two

separate cubes so one 4-point geometry has been lost in the stacking process. The energy

equivalence missing is equal to the group order minus the generators; here (4!-2) for an

object with spin. If we assume that the cubes only stack on the non-triangulated parts of

their surface this means that the down-type quark has twice the surface area for stacking

compared to the up-type (this is the source of the factor of two diﬀerence in the above

table). The strong coupling is strongly attractive in the region αs = 1 so energy has to be

put into the system to pull them further apart and there must be some potential energy of

separation at this energy scale. We will equate this with the ‘missing’ energy in the stacking

model. The odd thing we have here, however, is that the up and down quarks have a sign

associated with the non-triangulated parts of their topology; something quite unexpected

for the strong force! This sign diﬀerence on the identities is only found in the ‘strong’ matrix

in (29) and (31) but is essential if the algebra is to be consistent. Actually, the stacking

energy is always positive but the up and down-types enter the calculation viz. the ‘strong’

matrix identities in (29) and (31) with a diﬀerent sign. An example will illustrate the ideas

involved.

37

The calculation for the proton is found by summing over all possible pairings of stacked

quarks using the above table (gluons again expressed as Tr equivalent groups);

proton = |up + up| + 2|up + down| = | − 2(4! − 2)| + 2| + (4! − 2)| = 4(4! − 2)

neutron = |down + down| + 2|up + down| = | + 4(4! − 2)| + 2|(4! − 2)| = 6(4! − 2)

where the arbitrary sign choice on the gluon components has been eliminated in the calcu-

lation.

Why glue corrections do not originate from the identities in the second block matrix

(called the EM component) in expressions (29) for the proton and (31) for the neutron is

unclear but comparison with empirical data shows that they do not contribute. It is possible

this is because the two block matrix representation of the current quarks is fermionic and

the single block rep. is appropriate for the bosonic gluon corrections.

XIII. NUCLEON MASSES CONTINUED

It is reasonable to assert that quantum chromodynamics is well established empirically

as the correct theory of the strong interactions. The coupling between the gluons and the

quarks displays asymptotic freedom at high energy i.e. at high energy the quarks behave

like free partons and the coupling is weak. At low energy however the coupling is strong

and perturbative calculations are not possible. Of necessity, calculation of the rest mass of

any hadron will place the interaction in the non-perturbative strong coupling region.

In the previous sections a discrete model of QCD was developed employing discrete

rather than continuous colour and calculations summing the matrix order of the discrete

components of the model were made. The analogy with the tetrahedral group is now to

be extended to the deﬁnition of mass. From a continuous group (SU(2) in the case of the

tetrahedron) a discrete sub-group of elements is extracted which represents a ﬁnite bare mass

term where the actual ﬁnite group involved is dictated by the symmetry of the geometry.

38

For aﬃne-set geometries there is always a permutation symmetry of the points of the set. To

calculate radiative corrections to masses, as in the case of the calculation of the rest mass

of the electron (eq.23), we do not sum over boson momenta in the case of cubic quarks.

Instead we invoke the same ansat¨z of equilibrating boson energy to the Dirac mass of the

associated fermion multiplied by the coupling constant at that energy scale. In the case at

hand one would expect that the scale appropriate is q2≈m 2

q where mq is the current quark

mass but this may not be quite correct because the current quark masses contain both q/q∗

charged pieces and I/I electrically neutral pieces and the correct energy scale to set αem

may be more like half the current quark mass. In any case it makes little diﬀerence since

αem q2=m2

q is little diﬀerent from αem q2=0 for the up and down quarks.

The value of the strong coupling is speciﬁed by setting the gluon energy in matrix units

equal to constituent quark matrix units; this sets the strong coupling at 1 unambiguously

for the non-perturbative calculation.

We are now in a position to calculate our nucleon masses. Basically we have four types of

components. The ﬁrst two components are the constituent quark mass and the constituent

gluon mass equivalence and these are almost exactly the same (expressions 26 and 27).

These terms, in the transition to a ﬁeld theory, represent the energy associated with the

motion of the current quarks and the momentum of the gluons. They dominate the mass

expression and indicate that, to a good approximation, about 1/2 the nucleon momentum is

carried by the gluons. It is possible to produce an exact calculation. The constituent quark

energy is;

and the constituent gluon energy is

6.(4!).6(4! − 2).R

6.(4!).6(4!).R

where R = (αs + αem + Gf ) and αs = 1 precisely. (A variable αs coupling constant and

asymptotic freedom will only appear in the transition to a ﬁeld theory with all its attendant

complications).

39

To these components we must add the current quark masses which are in two pieces; the

electro-magnetically charged current quark masses calculated from the tables and the glue

corrections to the current quark masses calculated in the previous section. For the proton

we calculated the current quark mass as;

2{9.4! + 3.(4! − 2)}.R + 4.(4! − 2)

and for the neutron we calculated the total current quark mass as;

2.12.4!.R + 6.(4! − 2)

where in each case the glue corrections to the current quarks are the ones without

electro-magnetic or weak radiative corrections. The derived current quark masses are

up≈4.6120MeV and down≈5.9053MeV. One then obtains the following expressions for the

nucleon masses directly;

Proton Mass = R.(8! − 12) + 4.(4! − 2) ; Neutron Mass = R.8! + 6.(4! − 2)

(33)

Notice that the cubic geometry is implicit in the resulting expressions even though each

quark is represented by an individual cubic geometry; they sum to provide a single eﬀective

colourless cube as is represented by the appearance of the 8! which is the order of the S8

permutation symmetry group. (The permutation symmetry is characteristic of an aﬃne-set

geometry; in this case of 8 points).

This seems to be the reason why the nucleons are so special; they have the geometry

of quarks but they are not coloured. In this they appear to be unique and it is possible

this exceptional expression of symmetry is the reason why protons and neutrons are so

fundamental to physical structure.

The 12 massless generators in the proton mass expression are the 6 pairs of generators

associated with the surface of the cube (they can be seen explicitly in the current quark

masses expressions; they are associated with the three q∗’s in the E.M. matrix (right matrix)

of expression (29) - one q cancels one of the q∗’s and parity doubling doubles the number of

40

q∗’s to 6 - each of which is associated with two massless generators of an S4 symmetry; the

q’s in the right-hand matrix in (29) of course have no generators) and explicitly appear in

the charged object as would be expected. The neutral cube, although its structure contains

analogous generators, does not manifest these generators explicitly (the q’s cancel the q∗’s

in the current quark EM matrix (31)). The mass expressions can be converted into MeV

by using the electron mass=R(4! − 2). (This of course does not mean that the electron has

αs in its gauge ﬁeld correction; the ‘1’ in this case is the tetrahedral unit of mass which is

For simplicity we set αem; q2=0 in the R for both nucleons and electron. Setting Gf ≈

1.4 × 10−5 (a value extracted from study of the lepton masses - see later in the text) gives

R ≈ 1.0073115 and we obtain;

Both values are a little high, but given the uncertainties in the couplings αem and Gf ,

the results are very good.

XIV. WHY DOES THE GLUON MOMENTUM RELATED TO THE

CONSTITUENT QUARKS HAVE A αEM + GF RADIATIVE CORRECTION?

Good question! As might be expected the gluon correction to the current quark mass

only has a multiplier ‘1’ which can be interpreted as αs, but the ‘constituent’ glue energy,

(28) has an electro-weak radiative correction! This appears quite out of place; only an αs = 1

should appear with the glue momentum - but if we omit the electro-weak radiative correction

the result is well outside the experimental value. The calculation results at the end of the

last section clearly suggest that there should be an electro-weak radiative correction to the

constituent glue energy, but why?

41

If we are to have a theory free of any arbitrary parameters then the value of αem must

be based on the geometry also. This is dangerous territory (almost a taboo topic in physics)

but it must unfortunately be attacked.

There is only one (Dirac) massive geometric object - the tetrahedron - in two (fermionic)

incarnations; as lepton and quark (the cube geometry ultimately reduces to tetrahedral

units). The ﬁne structure constant appears to represents the ratio of the number of eﬀec-

tive tetrahedral groups generated by the Tc (cubic) generators compared with the single

tetrahedral geometry generated by the Tr generators (noting that in a unit charge cubic

proton there is an amalgam of six eﬀective pairs of Tc tetrahedral generators); the lepton

generators are about 137 times more potent at generating electro-magnetic charge than the

quark generators. The explicit E.M. component associated with the 6 pairs of Tc generators

on the surface of a unit charged cube such as a proton is 6.(4!-2) + radiative corrections.

If we strip this oﬀ the proton and then remove the constituent gluon energy with only the

αs = 1 coupling to the gluon energy - i.e. what we physically expect - (omitting the weak

interaction in both cases), divide by six to get the relative charge-generating power of one

of the six pairs of Tc generators and then divide out the tetrahedral units we ﬁnd ;

(34)

which gives a value α−1 ≈ 137.03596 which would be an appropriate value for αem at

the energy scale involved i.e. not at q2 = 0 but at the electron rest mass (Tr) scale of

≈ 0.5MeV . Equation (34) tells us that, as expected, the gluons don’t in fact have electro-

magnetic radiative corrections; the fact that the gluons carry no electro-magnetic charge is

absorbed into the value of the coupling constant in the nucleon mass expressions (33).

Let is try and interpret this expression. The proton as a cubic geometry has the same

geometry as a quark; stripped of its current quark interactions and gluon momentum it

is a large collection of S4 units with 4! matrix elements each. The surface charge 6.(4!-

2)(1+αem) may be considered an electro-magnetic interaction energy between the charged

current quarks. Eq.(34) tells us that, when this latter energy, and the gluon energy, is

42

eliminated, one pair of Tc generators generates exactly 137.0359... units of 4! matrix elements

while the lepton pair Tr generators only generate one S4 group of matrix elements (we are not

concerned with mass here but rather with matrix elements; that at least is the justiﬁcation

for using 4!

instead of (4!-2) in the divisor of eqn.(34) - mass and charge of course are

not the same thing!). So, in this sense, the lepton Tr generators are 137.0359..

times

more powerful than the quark generators and creating electro-magnetic charge. Geometry

generators generate intrinsic spin and so generate the local (gauge) phase on the geometry

which generates the gauge ﬁelds which generate space-time.....

Thus maybe αem represents a compensating mechanism which allows quarks and leptons

to occupy the same space-time with the same electro-magnetic gauge ﬁeld coupling to both;

they have the same electro-magnetic vacuum. All quite speculative to be sure but there

must be a reason for everything in nature yes? At least this speculation can give some

justiﬁcation for the radiative correction found in eqn.(28).

Once again the fact that the transition to a formal ﬁeld theory results in a variable αem

with energy scale does not invalidate this concept because the masses also will change with

energy in a ﬁeld theory. What we can assert is that the running coupling αem; (q2) will evolve

with energy in such a way the the quarks and leptons continue to ‘see’ the same space-time

as the energy scale evolves. A changing αem indicates that the quarks and lepton masses

will not evolve in exactly the same way with increasing energy.

Notice that there is an implicit assumption in eq.(34) it assumes that the electron and

proton have exactly the same absolute value of charge; i.e. charge quantisation.

XV. MASS FORMULAE WITH SOME GENERAL COMMENTS

proton mass

R.(8!-12)+4.ω

neutron mass

R.(8!)+6.ω

electron mass

R.(4!-2)

muon mass R.(4!-2)+6.6!+2.5!

tau mass R.(4!-2)+8!+7.7!+2.6!

The value R here is considered to be a non-perturbative radiative correction which is

assumed to have the following simple form R = 1 + α + Gf where α is the ﬁne structure

constant and Gf is the weak coupling constant converted to a dimensionless constant by use

of a selected energy scale (we will take a low energy scale whereby it is assumed that, in

comparison to the electro-magnetic coupling constant, Gf has a value ≈ 10−5). The extra

bits added on to the muon and tau are Higgs components and we will examine these more

closely later.

Of course α and Gf are scale dependent parameters whose value varies with energy scale

but we are not here necessarily implying radiative corrections found by summing over a range

of boson energies. Rather it is being assumed that, instead of a perturbation expansion, a

ﬁnite radiative correction can be applied to a ﬁnite ‘bare’ mass;

in the case of electro-

magnetism of order α at q2≈m 2

e (although one must always keep an open mind as it is

possible the perturbation expansion has a ﬁnite sum for some at present unknown reason;

that the electro-magnetic radiative correction to the electron mass, for example, is of order

α has been suggested before [2].) The term ω has the value;

There is one free parameter in the mass expressions; the energy scale used to render the

weak coupling to a dimensionless number but the weak vector gauge boson masses can be

calculated. Notice that R is probably the simplest possible conceivable non-perturbative

radiative correction one could propose.

ω = (4! − 2)

44

The best ﬁt is given by Gf = 1.4101 × 10−5 using α−1 = 137.035989. This then yields

the following masses (current empirical values in parentheses);

Mµ/Me = 206.7682621(206.7682657(63))

Mτ /Me = 3477.4006381(3477.60(57)).

Both ratios are within one σ of the empirical data and are predicted to higher accuracy

than current data and can thus be tested. Since the predicted masses are all within one σ

of the empirical value the χ2 value is less than one indicating a very good ﬁt with the data.

Can we discern any patterns in the other parts of the data formulas? The obvious thing

is the presence of factorial numbers is all the expressions. This suggests a discrete symmetry

under permutation. Evidently the charged leptons are built around a symmetry that involves

a permutation of four objects (not necessarily particles!), the nucleons a permutation of eight

objects and the pions seven with a speciﬁcally identiﬁable six-object subgroup (the pions

have not been included here).

Suppose the basic lepton unit mass, R(4! − 2), is related to tetrahedral symmetry; the

permutation group of the vertices of a tetrahedron is isomorphic to the discrete group Td

of the three-dimensional tetrahedron. This group has two generators and 4! elements. An

alternative more realistic choice may be Tr the unique 24 element sub group of SU(2) which

also has two generators; the -2 can then be considered to correspond to the generators of

the group (the masslessness of which we associated with intrinsic spin). This sub-group is

of the non-abelian type. The tetrahedral structure may represent a type of 3-dimensional

brane or orbifold. The idea of such a symmetry underlying physical structure is of some

current interest in ﬁeld theory and of course has long been a feature of physical chemistry

(tetrahedral symmetry is a feature of some crystal structures for example). Firstly it has

been pointed out that certain soliton models of the Skyrme type (albeit for baryon structure)

have symmetry patterns of a tetrahedral, cubic and icosahedral nature [4]. Secondly there

has been some discussion of tetrahedral symmetry in relation to orbifold gauge ﬁeld theory

(for example [5], [6], [7], [8] and [9]; for a discussion of permutation symmetry in relation to

orbifolds see [10] and [11]). Of interest for example might be the association of tetrahedral

45

symmetry with a discrete subgroup of SU(3) which encompasses gauge ﬁelds appropriate

for the standard model [7] ˆE6 ≈ T and ˆE7 ≈ O where O is the octahedral (cubic) discrete

symmetry. We could then try to associate the 8! elements in the nucleons with a cubic type

of symmetry. This interpretation works rather neatly for the neutron because the extra ω

term in the mass expression for the neutron - the 6(4!-2) - could be interpreted as related

to the six square faces of a cube each of which could be allocated a tetrahedral-equivalent

symmetry of total 4! elements with two generators (each square face of course has four

vertices). The appearance of electro-magnetic radiative corrections for the neutron might

also be taken to imply charged sub-structure.

Of course what is being studied in the above references such as [5], [6] and [7] is, chieﬂy,

the issue of symmetry (and in particular supersymmetry) groups connecting diﬀerent types of

particles not masses of individual particles. However, there may be a connection. We might,

for example, view the discrete symmetry as a kind of symmetry of the unobservable bare

particle; a particle devoid of its investing gauge ﬁelds. Of course the ‘bare’ particle structure

in ﬁeld theory is not only unobservable it is mathematically inaccessible being plagued by

inﬁnities (inﬁnite mass, inﬁnite charge etc.) but this might be an artifact of our ignorance

of some underlying discrete structure. The surface geometries of such a discrete structure

may form the gauge ﬁelds as a worldvolume brane type structure rendering the underlying

symmetry unobservable. For example, if the isolated tetrahedron is a ‘bare’ lepton then the

triangular surface geometries may be considered to be photons and the individual interval

‘edges’ of the geometry to be gravitons. (A quick review of the geometry of these objects

will reveal that the triangle symmetry is appropriate for a discrete spin-1 object and the

single interval or ‘edge’ of the geometry appropriate for a spin-2 object). Because of the

non-abelian nature of the double-cover tetrahedral group its overall discrete ‘SU(2)-phase’

might then be ‘gauged-away‘ by the weak vector gauge bosons so that all phase information

in relation to the discrete geometry - the phase of each individual edge, the U(1) phase

of each investing triangle and the global SU(2) phase of the total geometry, becomes ex-

perimentally unobservable when the gauge ﬁelds propagate and sweep-out world-volumes

46

that render the underlying discrete symmetry unobservable. Such a scenario intrinsically

demands local gauge invariance because of the discrete nature of the geometry (perhaps this

is why nature chooses local gauge invariance?). A ﬂat ‘square’ version of the tetrahedron

would be necessary to account for uncharged neutrinos of course; the absence of any trian-

gular sub-geometry would then correspond to the absence of electric charge - it would of

course retain an overall SU(2) weak ‘local’ phase and its gravitational investing gauge ﬁeld

associated with the individual investing intervals of the geometry. There are problems with

this interpretation however, because a ﬂat two-dimensional geometry is nominally spin 1

and massless. We will return to this issue later.

The only residue of discreteness would then be the rest mass of the object. The sym-

metries between particle types may then arise because of this shared underlying discrete

structure; we can see from the mass formulas for the hadrons that the tetrahedral symmetry

appears to be embedded in the cubic symmetry for example. There is in fact quark-lepton

uniﬁcation here.

XVI. VECTOR GAUGE BOSON MASSES AND ELECTRO-WEAK MIXING

Now, Tr (or the 3-geometry analogue Td), is spinorial in the double covering sense so that

this group would be appropriate for a spinor particle but not for a boson. The analogous

‘bosonic’ group for a tetrahedron is T which has 12 elements and two generators. Suppose

we were to choose this kind of geometry for our vector gauge bosons, since it matches the

geometry of the leptons in this model apparently and is triangulated; a requirement for

charged vector gauge bosons at least. How can we create a factorial expression out of the T

elements; assuming that this is the only way mass is expressible for an aﬃne-set geometry?

The easiest and simplest way is to take the non-generator elements of T and assemble them

into a permutation group viz;

and we can then arrange, viz some appropriate choice of decomposition, a model for the

(T − 2)! = 10!

47

vector boson masses. First, note that any permutation number has a unique decomposition

into a sum of permutations;

n! = (n − 1)(n − 1)! + (n − 2)(n − 2)! + ... + 1.1! + 0!

so if we take the 10! elements and strip-oﬀ a tetrahedral equivalent unit 4!=3.3!+2.2!+1!+0!

to couple to the underlying four-point geometry (and deﬁne it physically - a reasonable

pre-requisite) we end up with a unique and inevitable decomposition into six components if

we are working with aﬃne-set geometries;

10! = 9.9! + 8.8! + 7.7! + 6.6! + 5.5! + 4.4! + (4!)

and we throw away the last 4! Each ‘10!’ should correspond to the mass of one vector gauge

boson. At this stage comparison with the empirical data shows that maximal mixing of the

charged components on the 8! (cubic) and 4! (tetrahedral) geometry terms occurs. The

charge appears only in the W ± so the mass shifts only to the Z 0 in maximal mixing;

Boson 9.9! 8.8! 7.7! 6.6! 5.5! 4.4!

which sums to 3.10! as required.

In these mass expressions what has happened is that each W ± has ‘donated’ half its’

charged S8 component of mass to the Z 0; a 4.8!(1 + αq2=M 2

) from its mass to the Z 0 so that

W

the Z 0 has a term (8.8! + (1 + αq2=M 2

W

)8.8!) instead of just 8.8! as its second component of

mass; and similarly for the S4 terms. In this process we expect each ‘donated’ piece to keeps

its’ radiative correction. On the basis of the analysis of αem in section Taking α = 128−1

‘on-shell’ at q2 = m2

W instead of q2 ≈ 0 we obtain;

M 0

z = 91.1729(91.188(0.007))GeV and MW = 80.5794(80.49(0.14))GeV

48

which gives, using cosθ = MW
MZ

, sin2θ = 0.2188. This is the value with radiative corrections

to the masses included. If one omits these one easily obtains sin2θ = 0.2299. It is interesting

to note that the weak mixing is related to shifting of mass components from both the charged

bosons to the neutral vector gauge boson. For example, if this mixing did not occur the

weak mixing angle would be very small and due only to radiative corrections to the W mass.

Notice that charge neutrality of the Z 0 is maintained in spite of the radiative corrections to

its mass since it obtains two equal contributions from opposite charge consignments.

What is most interesting is that 1. the electro-weak mixing is taking place at the S8

symmetry level; exactly the level we used previously to extract a value for the ﬁne structure

constant (the proton mass is an S8 symmetry)and this is the reason for adding the S4 mixing

even though on the basis of the empirical data this is not so strongly implied, and 2. the

mixing is maximal! There is absolutely no arbitrariness at all in the value of the weak mixing

angle if one can account for the maximal mixing (which unfortunately we cannot).

XVII. THE HIGGS FIELD

Let us focus ﬁrst on the masses of the charged leptons. Notice that the component

with radiative corrections is identical in each of the three species of lepton. This suggests

that the component carrying the electro-magnetic charge is identical in each case and this

is consistent with charge quantisation. The formulas for the leptons imply that there is a

common component in the leptons which is responsible for generating the electro-magnetic

charge (and weak interaction properties) of the individual leptons as well as the intrinsic

spin (it is the only piece with generators set explicitly massless). Let us then attribute the

remaining mass components in the muon and tau to the Higgs scalar ﬁeld. This is a spinless

ﬁeld and the lack of a radiative correction for these mass components (at least to the level

of the current data) implies that, if these components are the result of the Higgs mechanism

alone, that the Higgs particle is not electro-magnetically charged because of the absence of

any associated radiative correction for the electro-magnetic ﬁeld. We might also postulate

49

that the -2 appearing with the charged component of lepton mass is related to intrinsic spin.

This makes some sense since, ﬁrstly, it implies identical intrinsic spin in all three massive

leptons and, secondly, its absence in the components in the lepton masses without radiative

corrections would then imply that they are spinless as required of the Higgs ﬁeld. Whether

the Higgs can also be considered responsible for the R(4! − 2) part of the lepton mass is an

open question. This piece of mass, identical to the electron rest mass, we might attribute

it to the 4! piece we ‘throw’ away when we decompose a large scalar factorial unit. Clearly

we need the Higgs for correct dimensions in the Lagrangian;

L = gψRψL

of any fermion.

This prompts a search for the pattern of Higgs components appropriate for the massive

quarks and leptons. For consistency we will use the same basic structure that we employed

for generating the Higgs components for the vector gauge bosons since the same Higgs

generates the masses for both sets of particles. From the known spectrum of masses clearly

the symmetry will be broken. Using the components already listed for the tau and the muon

the symmetry breaks up as follows (using a 2.S10 to couple to the fermions in comparison

to the 3.S10 we used to couple to the adjoint representation of the vector gauge bosons);

The known quark masses have been used as a guide to the decomposition. The ﬁrst

generation quarks and leptons have been left massless (and consequently an amount of mass

equal to 5.5!+8.4! unaccounted for!). The pion mass expressions however imply that, under

some circumstances, the up acquires a contribution of 5! and the down of 4!. Detailed study

of meson ground state masses (unpublished [13]) appears to indicate that these missing

components - the 5.5!+8.4! - do not appear in any of the second or third generation quarks.

It is possible they contribute to the ω terms that appear in the hadron mass expressions or

more likely they in fact manifest as the baseline tetrahedral units in both quarks and leptons

(for example the (4!-2) part of the electron mass). As mentioned, such a contribution from

the Higgs is needed to get the dimensions of the Lagrangian right for all Dirac particles.

From the table the Higgs contribution to the quark masses are; top ≈ 159.9GeV, bottom

≈ 4.65GeV, charm ≈ 863MeV and strange ≈ 24.9MeV. It is interesting to note that the

ﬁfth ﬂavour line appears to be breaking up in SU(5) multiplets and the third quark ﬂavour

line in SU(3) multiplets. The lepton terms are dominated by singlets.

51

With these postulates in mind can we make a guess at the Higgs mass? Obviously

it must be related to a factorial number if these mass expressions have any real physical

meaning. The minimum choice would, from the above discussion, be a multiple of 10! which

translates into an integral multiple of about 83GeV. However this is based on the (T-2)!

bosonic geometry not on a scalar geometry. Could we propose a scalar geometry such as T!

(which would be scalar under the assumption of no massless generators)? Unfortunately this

translates into a mass of the order of 11.05TeV which appears to be an order of magnitude

too high for a prospective Higgs scalar which is expected to be of the order of 1TeV or less.

XVIII. NEUTRINOS

The theory of neutrinos has been left to last in this paper because this is probably the

most diﬃcult area of the theory to analyse.

Let us ﬁrst consider what the geometry of a neutrino should be from ﬁrst principles and

see where the problem lies. The massive leptons in this theory are particles which deﬁne a

tetrahedral 3-space continuum. The diﬀerent masses of the e, µ and τ derive solely from the

diﬀerent Higgs components listed in the previous table (Section XV).

The Higgs components are considered to be ‘internalised’ in the tetrahedral geometry;

that is, they are located inside the boundary of the geometry in a time-less space. The

number of actual vertices in the geometry depends on the leading term of the Higgs mass

components. Thus, the tau lepton, which has components 8! + 7.7! +2.6!

is an 8-vertex

geometry with 4 vertices internalised inside the tetrahedron (the 8! mass component relates

to a S8 permutation symmetry of the vertices). The boundary of the geometry which embeds

in the surrounding space-time is identical to the electron and has a tetrahedral morphology.

The S6 and S7 symmetries are sub-groups of the 8-vertex geometry. Similarly we can see,

from the Higgs components, that the muon must be a 6-vertex geometry with two internalised

vertices.

Let us hypothesise that the corresponding neutrinos conserve vertex number; this is

52

geometrically the most intuitively obvious choice. This means that the ντ is an 8 vertex

(but two-dimensional) geometry, the νµ is a 6-vertex (two-dimensional) geometry and the

νe a 4-vertex geometry ﬂat ‘square’. The proposed geometric forms are all two-dimensional

and are as follows;

ν

e

ν

µ

ν

τ

The absence of any Higgs components for mass generation in the neutrinos means that

they cannot be Dirac particles in this theory. Let us see why.

It is instructive to consider ﬁrst the case of the electron neutrino. The electron has a

basic mass unit formed from the tetrahedral symmetry group because it forms a 3-volume in

space-time. This mass is given by a tetrahedral S4 symmetry. The corresponding neutrino

must be a 4-vertex geometry but morphologically distinct to the electron. Because in aﬃne-

set geometry all tetrahedrons are equal, the unique choice would appear to be a ﬂat 4-vertex

square. But this must be massless in this theory as has been previously explained. Worse

still, such a geometry represents a boson! (Unlike with the case of the tetrahedron, no spinor

group can be associated with a two-dimensional square symmetry as the geometry generator

There appears to be only one way around this impasse and that is to assume that the

structure of space-time is more complex than has been listed in the hypotheses so far. We

acts as a vector).

add the following;

Hypothesis 11; That the time dimension for spinors is retarded with respect to bosons.

53

This is analogous to admitting a violation of special relativity into the theory but with

special restrictions. What it means is that the neutrino can be a ﬂat square geometry with

respect to time as deﬁned for an electron but remains a tetrahedral geometry with respect to

a photon and time as deﬁned for a macroscopic observer; so it will be a spinor with respect

to any boson interacting with it. For this to be achieved we need two copies of the Lorentz

group; one for spinors and one for bosons (surprisingly CPT symmetry between particles and

anti-particles will be maintained in such a scheme because the symmetry is broken between

bosons and fermions; not between two fermions so that particles and anti-particles would

still have the same mass and lifetime etc).

In terms of cardinality this means admitting the existence of a cardinality ℵ1 such that

ℵ0 < ℵ1 < c

as permitted by the formal undecidability of the continuum hypothesis. This means that,

in the absence of the weak interaction, the continuum hypothesis applies to the structure

of the universe but the addition of the weak interaction, and speciﬁcally the Higgs ﬁeld, is

equivalent to adding an extra order of cardinality to space-time. The propagating neutrino

sweeps out a space of cardinality ℵ1 which is less than that of the continuum. Its’ weak

radiative corrections must then be responsible for the elevation of the cardinality of the

contained space to that of the continuum and in so doing generate a mass for the neutrino.

A good geometric way to think of this is as follows. In this theory gravitation is the gauge

ﬁeld of individual intervals in the boundaries of geometries - one dimensional ‘phase’- and

electro-magnetism is the gauge ﬁeld of triangles in the boundaries of geometries - a two-

dimensional gauge ﬁeld (a U(1) phase in this case). The weak interaction is like a ‘volume’

gauge ﬁeld; a three-dimensional phase of the geometry and, because this dimensionality is

associated with mass in this theory, the corresponding bosons must be massive.

In the case of the electron, the contained 3-volume within the tetrahedral boundary in the

absence of the weak interaction is a space of cardinality ℵ1 which weak radiative corrections

elevate to cardinality c. The weak interaction pushes up the cardinality of the contained

54

space within the tetrahedron. The mass gap generated for the electron is simply the weak

radiative correction to its’ mass which was previously calculated at about 7eV. We expect

a similar mass gap between the electron neutrino and the photon but this value seems to

be ruled out by experiment. Nevertheless, in the absence of any other physics modifying

things, this value is a deﬁnite prediction for the νe mass in this theory; a little under 7eV

(≈ 6.95eV).

In fact, looking at the lepton mass expressions given in Section XV it is easily seen

that the masses of the corresponding neutrinos are degenerate all with mass 6.95eV in

the absence of any physical properties associated with the ‘triangle’ ‘wings’ on the νµ and

ντ in the previous ﬁgure (these are expected to be scalar, not spin-1, and so should not

imply fractional EM charge - the only other possibility is that the triangles are paired with

opposite spins in which case both the νµ and the ντ , but not the νe, will have non-zero

magnetic moments).

A possible source of non-degeneracy of mass of the neutrinos may be derived from radia-

tive corrections to the Higgs components in this theory which have been assumed to be zero

(the only multiplier to the factors 6.6!+2.5! - the assumed ‘Higgs’ components of the muon

for example - is the number 1; no electro-magnetic or weak radiative correction appears).

Using the available data it is possible to put theoretical constraints on mass diﬀerences aris-

ing from radiative corrections to the Higgs ﬁeld (which would inply non-standard physics).

One readily obtains from the above table and the standard deviations of the empirical values;

Mass ντ − Mass νµ < 0.7MeV

Mass νµ − Mass νe < 9eV

to 95% CL. As the charged lepton masses become known more precisely these constraints

can be further restricted.

Can we have sterile neutrinos?

If the triangular ‘wings’ on the νµ and ντ are spin 0, and if there is a mass diﬀerence

55

between states to provide some phase space, then it should be possible to produce the

following weird geometries through decay mediated by a virtual Higgs particle;

ν

s

ν

s’

both of which have zero lepton number and in turn would decay to the electron neutrino.

If the triangular wings are pairs of spin-1 these states cannot exist but instead a variety of

anomalous non-standard interactions between neutrinos and matter must be possible causing

interconversions of one neutrino form to another; always complicated by the fact that, in

this model, special relativity will also break down in the neutrino sector.

XIX. CONCLUSION

In summary mass expressions for all the quarks, all the leptons and the gauge bosons

(under the assumption of massless gluons and photons) have been presented which are con-

cise and simple and all related to a permutation symmetry embedded in aﬃne-set geometry.

In particular, precise mass expressions have been presented for the leptons, the nucleons

and the vector gauge bosons all of which are testable in precision experiments. Theoretical

restrictions have been placed on the possible values the Higgs particle mass can be in this

schema; if it exists at all as a free particle (and in this theory there is reason to believe that

it may not!) it should appear as an integer multiple of about 83.67GeV. The most likely

candidate is a multiplier of 5 (to account for the ‘3’ of the vector gauge bosons and the ‘2’ of

the fermions). However, the most logical value for the Higgs is in fact the true tetrahedral

56

scalar boson 12! but this is more than 10 TeV and so appears to be ruled out.

The best precision test of the theory is the tau lepton mass which, in the absence of

radiative corrections to the Higgs ﬁeld, can be calculated precisely using the known values

of Me and Mµ. The current prediction is Mτ = 1776.95MeV.

Abstract

A comparison is given between the Newtonian and Einsteinian frames
of gravitation. From this it is shown that there exist a weak connection to
gravitation and electromagnetism. This connection is then studied more
thoroughly with the Weyl tensor and with the electromagnetic vacuum Λ.
Which dictates General Relativity should be reformulated to confer to a
‘Einstein-Cartan-Weyl’ geometry. Where it is seen that the Gravitational
Constant is the inverse of the Compton wavelength shown through a Weyl
gauge potential of form [Fαβ + Aα
aβ];β. The gauge potential along with
Einstein-Cartan geometry is argued to explain superluminal velocities ob-
served within General Relativity.

“The acceleration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed;
and is in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.”

Introduction

There are currently two viable models for the gravitational ﬁeld, being the
classical and the relativistic gravitational ﬁeld. Of course this refers to the law
of universal gravitation proposed by Newton and General Relativity (GR) by
Einstein. The two theories are certainly correlated and attempt to describe the
same phenomena, however mathematically they are treated quite diﬀerent from
one another. It thus becomes natural for the sake of coherence to give a uniﬁed
structure of the two theories, even if only ad hock. What is peculiar, or even

far more obvious is that both theories of gravitation are subtle variations of the
second law of motion.

The development of this work was made possible through studying the rela-
tionship between classical and relativistic gravitational ﬁelds where a weak con-
nection can be shown to electromagnetism. In previous works it has been shown
that the cosmological constant Λ can be represented by a covariant electromag-
netic ﬁeld [1], [2]. It has also been suggested that the cosmological constant
can be derived from the quantum vacuum [3], [4]. Using an analog of quantum
theory and electromagnetism an empirical uniﬁcation with gravitation is quickly
realized with the classical Kaluza-Klien (KK) theory [6]. From an empirical KK
geometry a connection with gravitation and Newton’s second law of motion can
be explained by means of the Weyl tensor within the GR formalism. The general
conclusion that can be arrived from this analysis is that GR is not a complete
theory of gravitation when only considering Ricci curvature of the Riemannian
manifold.

1.1 Newton-Einstein Gravity

It is obvious to start such a modeling with the widely known Newton-Einstein
action:

Here another generalization of the second law can be given with the equation

The gravitational ﬁeld is then deﬁned through ϕ = GM/R, thus a gravitational
ﬁeld is produced through poisson’s equation through
ϕ = 4πGρ. Where for
simplicity sake we receive the standard deviation for Newton’s gravitational
ﬁeld:

d~r2

It is quite clear that Newton’s formulation of gravitation is formed through the
his second law of motion. Which is explained as an external force mechanism
which causes masses to accelerate one another.

1.2 the absolute spacetime

Newton considered space and time as separate and ﬁnite invariant dimensions.
We can see this deﬁnition early on in Book I of Princpa by means of Scholium
I:

“absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own
nature ﬂows equably without regard to anything external, and by an-
other name is called duration: relative, apparent, and common time
is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequalable) mea-
sure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used
instead of true time; such as an hour, a day, a month, a year.”

A conclusion that is drawn from the roots of Euclidean geometry which can be
expressed in the form

ds =

dx2 + dy2 + dz2

(5)

where the following spatial identities arise by means of an inﬁnitesimal rotation:

p

F x = F xcosθ + F ysinθ, F y = F xsinθ + F ycosθ, F z

= F z

(6)

′

again we see how the spatial deﬁnition directly relates to the second law of
motion.

1.3 Special Relativity

With a suggestion from Minkowski Einstein transformed the cherished absolute
description of space and time to a relative space-time of the form:

ds2 = dct2

dx2

dy2

dz2

−

−

−

with the invention of a ‘spacetime’ continuum, one can notice subtle changes
with an inﬁnitesimal rotation:

ct′ = coshθct

sinhθx,

x′ = sinhθct + coshx,

y′ = y,

z′ = z

(8)

−

With Einstein’s fundamental postulate acceleration in such a frame would be
limited to the speed of light, lending the beta function:

working backwards now we can see that kinetic energy of a body in this frame
is given in the form

KE =

mγ3udu = mc2(γ

−

(10)

u

Z0

Thus at this point we see that these two diﬀerent formulations of space will
produce very diﬀerent forms of acceleration. In classical terms mass is deﬁned
as a focused point of force, while in relativistic terms it is deﬁned as ‘stress-
energy’ within an arbitrary manifold.

1.4 forces to ﬁelds

Taking a new look at Newton-Einstein gravity one may make a second order
generalization of the ﬁeld by:

Notice how this equation describes gravitation not as a force but as a manifold.
Furthermore mass is no longer an intrinsic property but a local ﬁeld in the
geometry, i.e. the change results in going from a point particle theory (mass)
to a ﬁeld theory (tensors). This force is taken equivalent to a manifold of the
form ∂f
∂xµ , assuming a Riemannian manifold and lines of calculations one
results in the Einstein-Field-Equation (EFE)

∂xµ = ∂

reality a consequence of the second law of motion, expressed diﬀerently only
in the terms of mathematical dimensions. Therefore one may wish to ex-
plain the gravitational force as a two dimensional acceleration of the form
F ′
g = a(E/c2)(E/c2)/dr2 = 4πaρ =
ϕ. Of course for a gravitational ﬁeld
a is replaced by Newton’s Gravitational constant G.

1.5 dimensional analysis of the gravitational constant

One can not deny the similarity between a classical gravitational ﬁeld and the
Coloumb Law Fcol = kQ1Q2/r2. Suggesting classically what Kaluza, Klein,
Weyl, and others have proposed, a uniﬁcation with the electromagnetic force.
In GR the ﬂat or massless gravitational ﬁeld is given with Ri
jR = 0. This is
not entirely correct because the kappa term does not entirely vanish leading to
Ri
jR = 8πke . . .. It is seen that the interpretation of a geometrical manifold
neglects gravitational acceleration. If it is a property of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
however, the second law of motion and the vacuum ﬁeld equations still hold true.
To elaborate more on the gravitational constant1 one must be familiar with
1Modern values given the gravitational constant as [5]: G = (6.74215 ± 0.000092) ×

In keeping with the relationship between the gravitation and the second law
of motion this must be rewritten in the form T 2 = kr3, which is analogous to
pendulum motion T 2 = 4π2 l/g where

Through dimensional analysis we can reduce this in a form which relates to the
Coloumb law:

relevently with Kepler’s Laws. Furthermore the gravitational constant G can

Thus it is seen that an observation will only occur in a quantum system if
two anti-symmetric η(5)
IJ tensors come in contact (which one might expect from
the Weyl tensor). This wave equation suggest KK-space expands into four-
dimensions, resulting in self interaction. Furthermore when one compares the
charge qn = n(k/R5) with the planck length, one sees the relation with the ﬁne
structure constant.

R5 =

From equation (38), from this it may be seen that the second law produces ﬁne
structure which in turn yields the planck length.

gauge backgrounds

The gravitational force is a collection of interacting forces connected in some
form by the second law (e.g. the ﬁne structure constant). When one separates
the properties of a given force from the Einstein equations, its fundamental
principle break resulting in only a weak equivalence principles (which can be
interpreted as a gravitational pressure). Thus lending a manifold whos proper-
ties depend on the pressures applied to it by external factors. By the methods
implied thus far it makes sense to make use of the semi-classical approach to

From this it is seen that the right of the equation is governed by the laws
of quantum mechanics giving a pseudo uniﬁcation through means of a complex
gauge ﬁeld. Meaning that the ﬁfth coordinate is false, however through complex
ﬁelds, torsion becomes an integral part of both sides of the gauge inequality. The
stress-energy tensor can have torsion along with electromagnetic ﬁeld through

From the above equation, it can be seen that at least empirically the vacuum
electrostatic potential (the true vacuum) is responsible for curvature of space-
time. If one were to block the vacuum energy as in the case of the Casimir eﬀect,
it will create an inequality within the pseudo geometry resulting in a gravita-
tional pressure. Therefore so to speak, a matter Lagrangian (false vacuum)
shields (true) vacuum (zero-point-ﬁeld) energy, thus resulting in negative en-
ergy, which may be interpreted through the Weyl tensor as torsion. Speciﬁcally
the interaction in time produced by the pseudo Kaluza-Klien space produces
the relationship between the vacuum states by [21]:

φout(k, η) = αφ+

k + βφ−

(67)

thus acting as the advanced and retarded Fouier series seen in section (2.1).
Therefore the Riemannian tensor Rµνρσ contracts via the Levi-Civita connection
to conserve the vacuum term, resulting in symmetric Ricci spacetime curvature,
along with an antisymmetric Weyl torsion.

6 EM vacuum and the Weyl tensor

If one takes the coeﬃcients of the Cosmological Constant and the Weyl tensor
one has the antisymetric ﬁeld C[ρσ][µν]Fµν F µν (note:
for simplicity the con-
trivariant term F µν , will be removed, it will be reinstated in (79))2. Which has

the following form:

C[ρσ]Fµν = Cµ

= CFµν = Cµ

[ρσ]µFµν = C[ρσ][µν]F µν Fµν
µFµν = Cµν F µν Fµν
= CρσF µν Fµν
Cρ[σµν] = 0

from this it may be seen that the Weyl tensor is an electromagnetic version of
GR.

One may now apply a jacobi identity in order to from a pseudo Bianchi

Identity of the form Cαβ[µν;λ] = 0. Which can be reduced to

From this we may conclude that a similar transformation will be made with the
anitsymmetric covariant term Cρσ. When we restore the ﬁeld with equation

Fµν + Aµ

C[ρσ] −

where the gauge term is assumed to be an Ansatz Aµ

this solution is parallel to the Einstein ﬁeld equation, when considering anti-

Thus it is seen that the cosmological constant is the source of torsion in
the antisymetric Weyl tensor. In essence the false electromagnetic vacuum is

through a weak superposition. However, we also note from section (4) a com-
plex solution is only empirical, thus (83) is only a pseudo action.

7 The vacuum and the meaning of G

An alternative interpretation of mass was assumed by de Broglie by the Einstein-
de Broglie equation:

¯hωC = m0c2.

(113)

This formalism has be restated recently by Haisch and Rueda [14] as a possible
explanation for the origin of inertial mass. Where C is given by the Compton
wavelength λC = h/mc, thereby asserting the origin of inertia through the
Compton wavelength. If we take the equivalence principle by heart then, one
must assume that gravitational inertial would arise through a similar action.
From Einstein-Cartan geometry we can assume that this ﬁeld would be given
through torsion. Speciﬁcally we will assume an equivalence of order ΛC =
2πG−1 (see A for details), this is validated by the quantization λC /2π. From
this we see that G is the inverse charge of an electron’s Compton wavelength.
In terms of EFE we have

(114)

in essence it appears that this is simply a post Einsteinian semi-classical cor-
rection to the ﬁeld equations (with teleparallel Weyl torsion acting as a gauge
background) .

From our supposed relation, one would have an identity of form λG = I.

Therefore the above relation transverses to

I = h/p. Thus:

GQi ≡

h/mc

=

λd
λC

(116)

(117)

where λd is the de Broglie wavelength given by λd = h/p. From Compton
scattering we may assume that gravitational waves can pass through particles
as though they were a wave. When we view the geodesic (66) one may rewrite
the identity in eq. (115), such that I = 1/√gkk. This results from a geodesic of
order [17]:

which is given by an electrons radius r = e2/m0c2 = 2.818
through the quantum correction one has 2πe2/hc = 1
137 . Further the inversion
by the Cosmological Constant3 yields the Gravitational Constant through the
identity 1/√gkk, or speciﬁcally through the geodesic coordinate uk = ∂S/∂xk.
Thus it is seen that the gravitational constant, ﬁne structure, and the second
law of motion appear to arrive from quantum charges!

×

7.1 standing waves and the ﬁfth coordinate

We note that a superposition of a sinusoidial wave yields a standing wave of
the form p = 2a sin(2πx/λ) cos(2πvt/λ). With this the standing wave of the
gravitational constant would be given through:

pG −

λ0 = 2a

cos(2πvt/λd)
sin(2πx/λC )

= cot 2a

vtλd
xλC

(119)

Thus G is the inverse ratio between the superposition of de Broglie and Compton
wavelengths4. This standing wave can be seen as potential barrier, which results
in the interaction of advanced and retarded potentials5. This action results in
the violation of the WEC, i.e. results in a false vacuum and Weyl gravitation.

3This prescription of the Cosmological Constant as the Compton wavelength λC , may have
bearing on modern cosmological theories. For example it has been proposed by recent obser-
vations from type IA supernova, there may be something causing the universe to accelerate
its expansion. Under this scenario, the Universe would be coasting from the initial ’big bang,’
however through a cosmological Compton scattering this eﬀect would appear to increase, thus
giving the allusion of an ‘accelerating’ universe.

4The idea of a quantum connection to the Gravitational Constant and the Cosmological

constant is not new idea, and neither is a superposition relation see Ref.[21].

5An alternative to this interpretaion arises through Quantum Mechanics, from SR an
electromagnetic ﬁeld at k reading locally as electric may read as a magnetic ﬁeld in the frame
k’. Through the action of the Weyl tensor the electric and magnetic terms may become
superimposed, thus initially one has a superposition of form ψ(x) = E(x) + H(x), which
doesn’t take on its SR form until the wave function has been canceled.

17

From this we understand that a gravitational constant is an inverse charge
of a particles Compton wavelength. Meaning that each particle has its own
local isotropic gravitational ﬁeld, which is induced by mass and acceleration.
This also leads to a startling corollary under relativistic velocities the charge of
spacetime Q would be altered. In such a situation the Compton charge would
be altered by

causing an inverse relation in the G (the consequences of such an eﬀect is brieﬂy
mentioned in B). Since the electromagnetic force has an inverse relationship
squared to inﬁnity, thus is the gravitational ﬁeld. Forces such as the Yang-Mills
ﬁeld are conﬁned within the Coloumb barrier, thus allowing the gravitational
ﬁeld at a ﬁrst approximation to adopt the Newton’s Gravitational constant GN .
ϕ = 4π[2a vtλd
]ρ.
When compared to classical gravitation one has the ﬁeld

From this a four-vector is required, thus gravitation is a charge in spacetime!

λC

Ψ(xµ, x5) = exp

(121)

(cid:20)
where it is interpreted that the gravitational force arises through torsion. While
electromagnetism is derived through the ﬁfth gauge-component of the torsion
tensor (which has been shown to be false in previous sections). This is a pseudo
complex interpretation produced by (119) and (67), thereby giving the allu-
sion to a ‘ﬁfth-coordinate,’ through a superposition mechanism.

(cid:21)

8 discussion

This analysis of a gravitational background space reveals the following sub-
tle quantum aspects of the gravitational ﬁeld. The dual interpretation of a
causal trajectory in the Feynman school, is responsible for the appearance of
a pseudo ‘ﬁfth coordinate.’ Thus causing true vacuum energy to translate into
false vacuum energy converting the potential virtual energy into kinetic energy.
This results in torsion within the background space, which acts to conserve the
negative energy created by the false vacuum. Torsion then acts to produce a
gravitational metric by means of a quantum charge, where by the equivalence
principle the second law becomes valid for a classical body. Secondarly torsion
alters the de Broglie wavelength which causes electrostatic potentials to lower,
acting as a relativistic gravitational ﬁeld.

This analysis showed the importance of the often neglected Weyl component
of Riemannian geometry. It is the antisymmetric Weyl tensor acting along with
an Einstein-Cartan geometry that is responsible for the gravitational constant.
Speciﬁcally pertaining to an electrons Compton wavelength for long range grav-
itation. However, for ﬁeld of varying charge one would expect the gravitational
constant and the cosmological constants to accept diﬀerent values, thus gravi-
tation in its true form would carry more than the background electromagnetic
vacuum, and gravitation would be expected to have ranges limited to there local
ﬁelds6.

6For example, nuclear ﬁelds do not correspond to the inverse square relationship 1/r2, thus

A The Compton wavelength and ‘superluminal’

shifts

length can be seen, when we except the value of G to be of order [5]:

G = (6.74215

0.000092)

±

×

10−11m3kg−1s−2.

(122)

We can now compare that to the Compton wavelength7 of an electron given by
10−12 m. However from ﬁeld density relationship shown
λC = h/mec = 2.426
in (80), we are left with the crude relation λC = 2πG−1, we must consider the
quantized wave form:

Thus the inverse of G is that of

2πG−1 = 0.02361 = λC ×

Such that it is seen that 2πG is the inverse of the Compton wavelength. Accel-
eration will altered the ‘charge’ or Compton wavelength such that gravitational
constant(s) would be altered upon relativistic velocities. This could very well
explain the propagation of observed superluminal jets emanating from Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN).

Since classically electromagnetic waves propagate via the relation C = λν,

we expect a gravitational shift from

force is one of a collective nature, all vacuum ﬁeld sources should be included within such a
potential formalism.

this is because (126), makes it appear that the wavelength λ is increasing while
it is really of function of C0 and ν0. This would appear to yield superluminal
travel, such a result is in accordance with [19]. This eﬀect does not seem to be
limited to AGN either, a superluminal source was also detected near SN1987A,
see [20].

B origin for inertia and mass increase?

From the previous section we have seen that the gravitational constant could be
considered as the inverse of the Compton wavelength. From (126), we now may
consider an inverse of the quantum energy E = hv and the classical wavelength
C = λν:

λd =

thus mass increase is governed by the action seen in (128). This is thus a
veriﬁcation of the equivalence principle, i.e.
inertial and gravitational masses
are equivalent! From (129) we can now consider a Lagrangian of form:

this interpretation runs parallel with [12]. However, this work diverges with
equation (126), thus it is λ which creates observable gravitational eﬀects and
not ν. With this in mind one can have an action of

therefore the appearance of inertia only appears for particles with a correspond-

C gravitation within the QED vacuum

It is known that particles such as the proton have a value of λc = h/mpc =
10−15 m, for the Compton wavelength. Meaning that Gravitation is

not a force directed by one term, but all terms of vacuum. Thus it maybe seen

that gravitation within an nucleus behaves quite diﬀerently than the Newtonian
prescription. We assume from elementary data that a ‘nuclear’ gravitational
ﬁeld would be conﬁned to the nucleus, not manifesting its eﬀects in the global
sense. However, for the early universe, one may have a spacetime with quite
diﬀerent cosmological constant(s) then the ones observed today, possibly giving
new justiﬁcation for inﬂation theory. Lastly in comparison to Appendix A, a
beam of protons being accelerated from an AGN source would result in another
prediction. The proton/electron ‘acceleration’ rates, and for any particle in
general is directly proportional to their Compton wavelengths.

D implications for the planck length

It is believed that the planck length lp = (Gh/c3)1/2, is the fundamental cut oﬀ
point for the gravitational ﬁeld. Two problems arise with this work 1) the planck
length is determined by the Compton wavelength of the mass in question. 2) the
gravitational constant and thus the planck length are altered upon acceleration.
The ﬁrst problem is not a problem it is simply a modiﬁcation required by the
theory, and for the large scale universe this result is negligible under a ﬁrst
approximation. The second problem is still a problem, however in an earlier
work [7], I modiﬁed the planck length with disconcern. However, with that
work in mind problem two is easily solved and is given by

Where GC is the gravitational constant given by the Compton wavelength, for
an electron this becomes Newton’s gravitational constant GN . And mp0 is the
rest momentum of the mass in question, which is given by

With this we see a gravitational uncertainty through ∆x∆p
after quantization of (136) we have a pure quantum charge, i.e GC h, thus grav-
itation carries the uncertainty of the Compton wavelength.

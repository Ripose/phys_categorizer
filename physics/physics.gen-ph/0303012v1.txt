On an Intriguing Signature-Reversal Exhibited by
Cremonian Spacetimes

Abstract

It is shown that a generic quadro-quartic Cremonian spacetime, which is endowed with one spatial and
three time dimensions, can continuously evolve into a signature-reversed conﬁguration, i.e. into the classical
spacetime featuring one temporal and three space dimensions. An interesting cosmological implication of
this ﬁnding is mentioned.

In a recent series of papers [1–4], we have introduced and examined in detail the concept of so-called
Cremonian spacetimes. A Cremonian spacetime is deﬁned as an algebraic geometrical conﬁguration
that lives in a three-dimensional projective space and consists of so-called fundamental elements
of a Cremona transformation generated by a homaloidal web of ruled quadrics. The fundamental
elements are found to be of two diﬀerent kinds, viz. lines and conics, and form distinct pencils, i.e.
linear, single parametrical aggregates. These pencils are taken to represent macroscopic dimensions
of the real physical world: those comprising lines – space, those consisting of conics – time. We have
further demonstrated that all generic Cremonian spacetimes which are associated with quadric-
generated Cremona transformations whose inverses are generated by cubic or quartic surfaces are
endowed with four dimensions. Yet, their signatures are not all the same. While the quadro-
cubic spacetimes [1,2] are endowed with three spatial and one time dimensions (and being thus
compatible with what Nature oﬀers to our senses), the quadro-quartic ones [3] feature just the
three temporal dimensions and a single spatial one. The aim of this note is to
opposite, i.e.
show that there exists a continuous deformation of a generic quadro-quartic spacetime resulting
in a signature-reversed manifold; the latter being a speciﬁc, ‘spatially anisotropic’ quadro-cubic
Cremonian spacetime [2].

With this end in view, we shall consider, following the symbols and notation of [1–3], a homa-

loidal web of quadrics

ϑ : ϑ1 ˘z3(˘z2 − ˘z3) + ϑ2 ˘z3(˘z1 − ˘z3) + ϑ3(˘z1 ˘z2 − ˘z2

with κ1, κ2 being real-valued parameters. The web generates the following Cremona transformation

where ̺ is a non-zero proportionality factor. Our task is to ﬁnd the structure of the conﬁguration of
fundamental elements associated with the above transformation. To furnish this task, we recall [1]
that a fundamental (also known, especially in older literature [5], as principal) element associated
with a given Cremona transformation is the totality of points, either a curve or a surface, in
the ﬁrst space whose counterpart (homologue) in the other space is just a single point. Upon
combining Eqs. (1) and (2) we ﬁnd that in the case under consideration the fundamental elements
are constituents of the following four pencils:

˘z2 − ˘z3 = 0 = ˘z3(˘z1 − ˘z3) + ϑ˘z4(κ1 ˘z1 − κ2 ˘z3), ϑ ≡ ϑ4/(ϑ2 + ϑ3),

ϑ : ˘z1 − ˘z3 = 0 = ˘z3(˘z2 − ˘z3) + ϑ˘z4(κ1 ˘z3 − κ2 ˘z2), ϑ ≡ ϑ4/(ϑ1 + ϑ3),

˘z3 = 0 = ˘z1˘z2 + ϑ˘z4(κ1 ˘z1 − κ2 ˘z2), ϑ ≡ ϑ4/ϑ3,

And now we arrive at a crucial observation: whereas the last pencil comprises one and the same
kind of geometrical objects, namely lines, irrespective of the value of the parameters κ1, κ2, this
is not the case with the other three pencils! Although, in general, each of these consists of proper
conics, there exist particular values of κ1 and κ2 when the conics of a given pencil become all
composite, featuring pairs of distinct real, coincident real, or conjugate complex lines. It represents
no diﬃculty to ﬁnd out when this happens. We shall ﬁrst consider the A-pencil. After introducing
a more convenient, ‘aﬃne’ parameter κ ≡ κ2/κ1, we see that this pencil consists of lines if and
only if κ = 1, viz.

where ϑ ≡ ϑ4/(ϑ1 + ϑ3). Finally, the C-pencil is found to comprise lines for κ = 0, viz.

where ϑ ≡ ϑ4/ϑ3. Our ﬁndings can succinctly be summarized as follows:

There are several important features readily discernible from this table. First, there exists
a (just recently discovered [1–3],) totally amazing three-to-one splitting in the character of the
pencils of fundamental elements regardless of the value of κ; that is, one of the pencils is always
of a qualitatively diﬀerent nature than the remaining three. Second, the far prevailing mode is
the 1+3 one, i.e. the conﬁguration (Cremonian spacetime) with one pencil of lines (one spatial
dimension) and three pencils of conics (three time dimensions); the three 3+1 conﬁgurations can
be seen as mere ‘islands’ in the ‘sea’ of 1+3’s. The third, and perhaps most intriguing, fact is
that we can freely move on the κ-axis in such a way that wherever we start we can always reach
one of the islands; in other words, a continuous variation of the parameter κ must always be
accompanied by gradual qualitative changes in the structure of the initial 1+3 conﬁguration so
that this conﬁguration will eventually be transformed into a 3+1 manifold.

In order to get a deeper insight into the nature of this ‘signature-reversal’ phenomenon, we
shall have a closer look at the base (i.e. shared by all the quadrics) elements of our homaloidal
web, Eq. (1). It is easy to verify that if κ diﬀers from 0, 1 and ∞ the only base elements are four
distinct, non-coplanar points, namely (̺ 6= 0)

B1 : ̺˘zα = (0, 1, 0, 0),

B2 : ̺˘zα = (1, 1, 1, 0),

(2), is of a so-called quadro-
this means that the corresponding Cremona transformation, Eq.
quartic type [3,5]. If, on the other hand, κ = 0, 1, and/or ∞ the web is endowed, in addition to
the four points, with a whole line of base points, namely the ˘z1 = 0 = ˘z3, ˘z1 − ˘z2 = 0 = ˘z2 − ˘z3,
and/or ˘z2 = 0 = ˘z3 one, respectively; in this case, the corresponding Cremona transformation is of a
qualitatively diﬀerent, so-called quadro-cubic type [1,2,5]. Moreover, this particular transformation
is not most general because the base line, which necessarily passes through the point B, contains
in each case also one of the remaining three base points, namely the point B1, B2 and/or B3,
respectively. Hence, the corresponding Cremonian spacetime, ﬁrst studied and described in detail
in [2], is found to be a little peculiar: it displays a sort of ‘spatial anisotropy’ in the sense that one
of its space dimensions has a slightly diﬀerent footing than the other two.

The ﬁndings of this paper may obviously turn out to be of some relevance to cosmology. There
is a growing suspicion among physicists [e.g. 6–10] that the Universe might have been born with a
diﬀerent (macro-)signature, and even a diﬀerent (macro-)dimensionality, than we currently observe.
It may well be that the ‘original’ signature was just the opposite, i.e. that the Universe was created
with a single space and three time dimensions, and the current signature could simply be a result
of the above-outlined Cremonian evolutionary ‘jump.’ If this scenario is correct then future more
sophisticated astrophysical observations are bound to reveal, as already stipulated in [2], that one
of the three macroscopic space dimensions is slightly at odds with the other two. This feature
would not only pose a serious challenge to some of the currently favoured physical paradigms (like,
e.g., CPT invariance), but would also raise a host of profound epistemological and ontological
questions.

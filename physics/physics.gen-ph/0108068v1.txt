Abstract
In this note we point to some problems related to the standard derivation of the radiation reaction 4-force, and we

propose a new expression for this 4-force, parallel to the 4-velocity.

The problem of whether a 4-force Fµ can be not orthogonal to the 4-velocity vµ has appeared long ago, when the
ponderomotive 4-force, in a system which dissipates energy by Joule heating, was considered [1]. Abraham [2] has
shown that, since an inertial mass must be ascribed to every kind of energy, the rest mass mo of the system has to
decrease, corresponding to the Joule heat dissipated. The ponderomotive 4-force must thus have a component parallel
to the 4-velocity, and the equation of motion is modiﬁed accordingly:

The rate of energy dissipation, reﬂected in the variation of the rest mass, is given by

Fµ =

(movµ) = mo

+ vµ

It is questionable why the same approach has not been applied to the case of radiation damping. The radiative
reaction force is introduced in order to satisfy an energy balance, for the nonrelativistic situation ﬁrst [3]. Thus the
work done by the radiative reaction force has to equal the energy dissipated through electromagnetic radiation:

The last part of (3) results from integrating by parts the Larmor power formula, if we assume that the motion is
either periodic, or ˙v · v = 0 at the moments t1 and t2. The radiation reaction force extracted this way is thus somehow
averaged, and does not reﬂect the instantaneous damping force.

In a ﬁrst questionable step, from (3) the radiation reaction force is extracted [3] as

q2
c3 ¨v.
We have to warn that, since in (3) F is in scalar product with v, the only meaningful information that can be
extracted is about the component of the force which is parallel to the velocity, (F·v)v/v2! Another problem related to
expression (4) is that it is not clear whether this force is indeed a damping force, pointing in the opposite direction than
the velocity. This problem is evident if we consider the ’runaway’ solution [3], in which the velocity, the acceleration
and the acceleration’s derivative are all parallel, pointing in the same direction, and increasing exponentially. This
solution can be eliminated, but with the price of introducing acausal eﬀects [4].

The force from (4) is generalized [1] to the relativistic case by introducing the derivative with respect to the proper

time τ .

In a second questionable step an extra term, speciﬁcally needed to ensure the orthogonality between the 4-force

and the 4-velocity, is added. The relativistic 4-force becomes:

Since the only reason for being of the radiation reaction force is to account for the dissipation of energy, and this
dissipation might be correlated to a decrease in the rest mass of the system, and furthermore only the component
of the force parallel to the velocity enters the energy balance equation, we can safely consider the radiation reaction

4-force as being parallel to the 4-velocity. In other words, we make the intuitive assumption that a force parallel to
the velocity will generalize to a 4-force parallel to the 4-velocity. We extract form (5) the component parallel to the
4-velocity, but pointing into the opposite direction, sought to describe the radiation reaction 4-force:

It is clear that this dissipative force (7) changes direction under time reversal, since the velocity changes direction.

From (2) and (7) we can calculate the rate of energy dissipation:

In the nonrelativistic limit we recover the exact (not averaged!) Larmor power formula:

The force (7) also satisﬁes Dirac’s [4] relativistic energy-momentum balance equation:

As Dirac pointed out, from this equation the radiation reaction force is not uniquely derived, but is determined up

to a perfect diﬀerential Bµ, subject only to the condition

The solution (5) is the result of choosing

and of assuming that the rest mass mo is constant. The solution (6) is obtained for

vµ = 0.

with a variable rest mass mo (but still with a constant charge q). The condition (11), using (2), reduces to (8).

While a few problems related to the 4-force (6) have been avoided with the solution (7), it is still unclear what is
the mechanism by which the charged particle acquires rest mass (energy) from the ﬁeld, such that it doesn’t vanish
through radiation. This problem, however, is also present in the classical solution, where it is supposed that ”changes
in the acceleration energy correspond to a reversible form of emission or absorption of ﬁeld energy, which never gets
very far from the electron” [4].

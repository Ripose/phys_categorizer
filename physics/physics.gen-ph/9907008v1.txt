Abstract

Starting from the knowledge of the four fundamental quantities
length L, mass M , time T , absolute temperature θ and accepting the
validity of Gauss’s law in all dimensions, we generalize, by the theory
of physical dimensions, the expressions of the Stephan-Boltzmann law
and of the Planck’s formula for the black-body radiation to a space-
time with one time and n space coordinates. In the particular case
n = 3 we shall recover the known results.

1 Introduction

in physics.

Applications of dimensional analysis to mechanical problems are well known

From a historical point of view, the ﬁrst seeds of that method can be

found in Newton’s “Principia” 1 and in Fourier’s “Th´eorie Analytique de

la Chaleur ” 2. Successively, important contributions to the modern treat-

ment of dimensional theory have been made by R.C.Tolman who deﬁned the

principle of dimensional homogeneity and stated the Π theorem 3.

It is worth noticing that dimensional analysis was employed by Albert

Einstein too in the calculus of the eigenfrequencies in solid bodies 4. He

set forth the pendulum example and, on obtaining T = C

as usual, said:

l
g

r

“One can, as is known, get a little more out from dimensional considerations,

but not with complete rigor. The dimensionless numerical factor (like C

here), whose magnitude is only given by a more or less detailed mathematical

theory, are usually of the order of unity. We cannot require this rigorously,

for why shouldn’t a numerical factor like (12π)3 appear in a mathemathical-

physical deduction? But without doubt such cases are rarities . . . ” 5.

For a more complete view of the subject, we refer the reader to the book

of Bridgman 6.

Our aim here is deducing the form of the Stephan-Boltzman law and

2

of the Planck’s formula in a space-time with one time and n space coordi-

nates, by employing the methods of dimensional analysis only. The minimum

knowledge of physics we need getting started is given by the deﬁnitions of

length L, mass M, time T and absolute temperature θ; we also accept the

validity of Gauss’s law in all dimensions and know the deﬁnitions of force

and energy. Finally, in the particular case n = 3 we shall recover the known

results on the basis of little physical information.

2 The universal constants and the Π theorem

Let us recall here some elements of physical dimensions theory. For instance,

if we aim at a physical theory of gravity, the three fundamental units L, M

and T are suﬃcient, but they must be associated as usual to some universal

constants. In the gravitational case two universal constants are needed: an

invariant velocity c with dimensions [c] = [LT − 1] and a gravitation constant

Gn, where the subscript n stands for the number of space coordinates, with

physical dimensions [Gn] = [LnM − 1T − 2]. The latter dimensional equality

follows immediately from Gauss’s law for the gravitational ﬁeld gn produced

by a n-dimensional distribution of mass ρn:

∇ · gn =

2πn/2
Γ(n/2)

−

Gnρn

(1)

and from the relation

F n = mgn

space:



as:

∇ · En =

2πn/2
Γ(n/2)

ρn

which gives the force F n (with dimensions [LMT − 2]) acting on a test mass

m located in the gravitational ﬁeld gn.

If the source is a point particle of mass M we have, in a n-dimensional

for n > 1

for n = 1

In dealing with electromagnetism, we need again c and another fundamen-

tal constant.We do not introduce any additional physical quantities besides

L, M and T ; so, Gauss’s law for the electrostatic ﬁeld En produced by a

n-dimensional distribution of charge ρn will be written, in Gaussian units,

Acting as in the gravitational case, the electrostatic ﬁeld En of a point charge

Qn (whose dimensions turn out to be [Ln/2M 1/2T − 1]) is :

Before going on, we notice that in the three dimensional space Coulomb’s

law for two point charges Z1e and Z2e

can be written, by introducing into it

the ﬁne structure constant

(7)

So the other fundamental constant we need can be either the electron charge

e or the Planck’s constant ¯h. Therefore when dealing within both gravity and

electromagnetism, we can associate (L, M, T ) with (c, G, e) or with (c, G, ¯h):

this agrees with the choices made, respectively by Stoney in 1874 7 and by

Planck in 1899 8. In our approach the appearance of the Planck’s constant

¯h is clearly related to the quantization of the electric charge, however.

Let us recall that, according to Planck, 8 the system of “natural units”

must include

(¯hc)/G as unit of mass,

(¯hG)/c3 as unit of length and

p

p

(¯hG)/c5 as unit of time; while according to Stoney 7 the “natural units”

p
for mass, length and time are e/√G, (√Ge)/c2 and (√Ge)/c3 respectively.

One sees immediately that Stoney’s units are given by Planck’s times the

square root of the ﬁne structure constant. By the way, one may notice that

Stoney’s conception of the electron is somewhat diﬀerent from that resulting

from the subsequent discovery by Thomson.

Going back to our task, it is suitable, in n spatial dimensions, to pass

from G to Gn and from α to αn = e2

n/(¯hnc); so, being αn dimensionless

by deﬁnition, the replacement of e with en and of ¯h with ¯hn makes their

respective dimensions to be [en] = [Ln/2M 1/2T − 1] and [¯hn] = [Ln− 1MT − 1].

Of course, the quantities labelled with n are deﬁned only formally and not

operationally, but this procedure will provide interesting results.

Let us ﬁx our attention at this point on ordinary thermodynamics. In

this case we need a fourth quantity, namely, the absolute temperature θ

which then must be associated with another universal constant. In a quite

natural way, we choose the Boltzmann constant k whose dimensions are

[L2MT − 2θ− 1].

appear.

Consequently in the dimensional equations which refer to the thermo-

dynamics of the electromagnetic radiation factors of the type cα¯hβ

nkγ must

Let us ﬁnally recall the so called Π theorem 6 which we state as fol-

lows: “Denote by P1, P2, . . . Pr the magnitudes of quantities which may be

physical magnitudes or experimental constants. Suppose that a functional

relation f (P1, P2, . . . Pr) = 0 holds, and furthermore that this is a complete

equation and is the only relation between the magnitudes. Then, if there

are s fundamental magnitudes the relation can be expressed in the form

F (Π1, Π2, . . . Πr− s) = 0 where the Π’s are the r

s independent products

−

6

of the arguments P1, P2, . . . Pr which are dimensionless in the fundamental

magnitudes”.

3 The Stefan-Boltzmann law

Now we are ready to establish the Stefan-Boltzmann law in a n-dimensional

space. Denoting by un(θ) the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation

enclosed in a cavity and in equilibrium at the temperature θ, the functional

relation quoted in the Π theorem is f (un, θ, c, ¯hn, k) = 0. In this case r

s =

4 = 1, so there is only one product Π which can be written in the form:

−

Π1 = u−1

n cα1¯hβ1

n kγ1θδ1

Remembering that [un] = [L2−nMT −2] and that consequently we shall have

to discard the values n = 1 and n = 2 by physical reasons, we obtain the

When n = 3 we recover the Stephan-Boltzmann law:

Obviously the numerical factor π2/15 which appears in that law cannot be

determined by dimensional analysis.

4 The Planck’s formula

Let us now obtain the Planck’s formula in a n-dimensional space.

Calling un,ω(ω, θ) the spectral energy density of the black-body radiation

in the frequency interval between ω and ω + dω, the functional relation is

now f (un,ω, ω, θ, c, ¯h, k) = 0. In this case r

s = 6

4 = 2, so there are two

products Π’s which will be written as

Π3 = θ−1cα3¯hβ3kγ3ωδ3

and satisfy a relation of the form F (Π2, Π3) = 0.

The two algebraic systems one obtains are:

1 = 0

α2 + β2 + 2γ2 + δ2 −

α3 + β3 + 2γ3 + δ3 = 0

with the respective solutions:

Therefore from the relation F (Π2, Π3) = 0 it follows that

un,ω =

¯hnω2n−3
c2n−3 ϕ

¯hnωn−2
cn−3kθ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

On the other hand it results, by deﬁnition, that

∞
0 un,ω(ω, θ) dω = un(θ);
R

so, by using the expressions already found for un,ω(ω, θ) and for un(θ), we

obtain the following equation to be satisﬁed by the unknown function ϕ:

Passing to the new variable εn = (¯hnωn−2)/cn−3, whose meaning as a photon

As to the function ϕ, some considerations are in order.

First of all ϕ cannot contain monomial terms in (¯hnωn−2)/(cn−3kθ), oth-

erwise it would modify the correct depedendence in Eq.(17) of un,ω on the

term ω2n− 3 which comes by multiplying the factor ωn− 2 contained in the

photon energy εn by the factor ωn− 1 due to the evaluation of the number of

photon states in the interval dω.

Second, when n = 3 we know the behavior of un,ω in the limits ω

(Rayleigh-Jeans’s law) and ω

(Wien’s law), so, when n = 3, one must

From a strictly mathematical point of view, the function ϕ which satisﬁes

Eq.(19) is not unique, but, taking into account our requirements, the choice

is very restricted and, discarding too involved expressions, one is left only

with the function

ϕ

εn
kθ (cid:17) ∝

kθ (cid:17) −
Once again, we notice that for n = 3 Eq.(17) becomes

and hence the Bose-Einstein statistics.

Had we ignored the behavior of the function ϕ as ω

0, the choice made

in Eq.(21) might have been changed to ϕ(εn/(kθ))

exp(

εn/(kθ)), which is

proper for the Boltzmann statistics, or even to ϕ(εn/(kθ))

5 Conclusions

We would like to focus attention on some interesting properties of dimensional

analysis we made use of in this paper.

First of all, in treating by the dimensional method a quite general prob-

lem of physics, it appeared of capital importance to associate the four fun-

damental quantities (L, M, T, θ) with as many universal constants, namely

(c, Gn, ¯hn, k). In less general situations, one needs only some of these costants;

for example, when restricting to the three-dimensional space, one can select

c and G for treating gravity, c and ¯h (or e) for treating electromagnetism or,

as in our case, c, ¯h and k for treating the electromagnetic radiation thermo-

dynamics.

On the other hand, such a prescription was alredy contained in the works

of Stoney 7 and of Planck 8. In Planck’s words natural units are such because

“ . . .

they are independent of particular bodies or substances, necessarily

11

retain their meanings in all times and in every culture even if extra-terrestrial

or extra-human.” 9

Secondly, let us comment on the power of the physical dimensions theory

to test the soundness of a physical law. To make an example let us consider

the Rayleigh-Jeans’s formula for black-body radiation. We can obtain it

if, contrary to what we just stated, we accept the widespread belief that

electromagnetism can be treated by employing as universal constant only

c, disregarding ¯h (or e). Acting as before, we would write, in three space

dimensions, the new functional relation among the quantities of interest as

f (u,ω, ω, θ, c, k) = 0. Now we have r

s = 5

4 = 1 so there is only the

The ﬁnal result

reproduces indeed, apart from numerical factors, the Rayleigh-Jeans’s for-

mula. As to the Stephan-Boltzmann law one easily realizes that, when re-

moving ¯h, Eq.(8) leads to r

s = 4

4 = 0 and hence no physical law

is obtainable, in accordance with the fact that now the energy density u(θ)

blows up to inﬁnity.

Lastly, we wish to remind the reader that a gravitational constant Gn

with dimensions LnM − 1T − 2 is currently used in higher dimensional theories

of gravity; so, it seems quite consistent that other universal constants such

as e or ¯h be extended to n dimensions! One must take however into account

the following. We have seen that the photon energy is εn = ¯hnωn−2/cn− 3

and hence its momentum is

pn|

|

= εn/c = ¯hn(ω/c)n−2 = ¯hn|

|

k

n−2; if now we

pass to matter waves and make use of the de Broglie’s relations, it happens

that only for n = 3 the connection is relativistically invariant.

13

Finally, we would like to add a brief comment about the so-called “black-

hole thermodynamics”, invented by authors so as Bekenstein 10 and Hawk-

ing 11 by generalizing the ordinary thermodynamics.

For instance, a black-body absorbs by deﬁnition every electromagnetic

radiation impinging on it, and was shown to emit a characteristic (Planck)

electromagnetic spectrum. By contrast, a black-hole is deﬁned as a body ab-

sorbing every kind of particle and radiation impinging on it, and is predicted

to emit a characteristic spectrum for each kind of particle or radiation. Such

spectra are expected to be Planck-like, except that in their denominator the

minus sign (valid in general for boson emissions) has to be replaced by a plus

sign in the case of fermion emissions.

These beautiful results have been reached by a clever, simultaneous re-

course to general relativity, quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. They

still lack, therefore, a deﬁnite theoretical foundation. From this point of view,

it may be interesting that they get some support by simple dimensional con-

siderations.

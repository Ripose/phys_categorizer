The Mean Field Theory of Nuclei
and The Bag Model of Baryon

1.1 Mean Field Theory of Nuclei (MFT)

Two model ﬁeld theories of the nuclear system were studied in detail by Serot and Walecka
[1]. The ﬁrst is based on baryons and neutral scalar and vector mesons (model QHD-I).
The quanta of the ﬁelds are the nucleons (n, p) and the sigma (σ) and omega (ω) mesons.
The neutral scalar meson couples to the scalar density of baryons through gsψψφ and the
neutral vector meson couples to the conserved baryon current through gvψγµψV µ.

The Lagrangian density for this model is

Eq. (1.2) is the Dirac equation with the scalar and vector ﬁelds. Eq. (1.3) is simply
the Klein-Gordon equation with a scalar source. And Eq. (1.4) looks like massive QED
with the conserved baryon current,

Lagrange’s equations ensure that this tensor is conserved and satisﬁes ∂µT µν = 0. It

follows that the energy-momentum P ν deﬁned by

P ν =

is a constant of motion.

We observe that at high baryon density, the scalar and vector ﬁeld operators can be
replaced by their expectation values, which then serve as classical, condensed ﬁelds in
which the baryons move,

The condensed, constant, classical ﬁelds φ0 and V0 are directly related to the baryon
sources. The source for V0 is simply the baryon density ρA = A/V . Since the baryon
current is conserved, the baryon number

is a constant of motion. For a uniform system of A baryons in a volume V , the baryon
density is also a constant of motion. In contrast, the source for φ0 involves the expectation
φ0. This quantity is dynamical that must be

calculated self-consistently using the thermodynamic argument that an isolated system
at ﬁxed A and V (and zero temperature) will minimize its energy,

The second nuclear model is more realistic. To discuss nuclei with Z

necessary to extend model QHD-I to include ρ mesons, which couple to the isovector
current, and the coulomb interaction.

Since we are also interested in comparing quantitative predictions with experiment, we
will extend the model to include the ρ meson and photon ﬁelds (QHD-II). The Lagrangian

For a given set of meson ﬁelds, the Dirac equations (1.27) and (1.28) may be solved
by integrating outward from the origin and inward from large r, matching the solutions
at some intermediate radius to determine the eigenvalues Ea. Analytic solutions in the
regions of large and small r allow the proper boundary conditions to be imposed.

1.2 Relativistic Nuclear Physics

Relativistic nuclear physics was ﬁrst pioneered and developed by Shakin and Celenza [2].
The systematic application of this theory is able to resolve some long-standing puzzles in
the theory of nuclear structure such as the binding energy and the saturation density of
nuclear matter, the eﬀective force in nuclei, and the nucleon self-energy for bound and

6

continuums. Its success is based upon the use of the Dirac equation for the description
of motion of a nucleon. The potentials appearing in the Dirac equation are assumed to
contain large (Lorentz) scalar and vector ﬁelds.

−

The scalar ﬁelds enter the Dirac equation in the same way as the nucleon mass. Since
these ﬁelds are quite large (
400 MeV), they have the eﬀect of including a major reduction
of the nucleon mass when the nucleon is in the nuclear matter. It is the description of this
change of mass of the nucleon that is an essential element in the success of the relativistic
approach. It is further necessary to understand that the vector ﬁeld seen by a nucleon
is large and repulsive, so that the energy of the nucleon in the nuclear matter does not
diﬀer very much from the energy of a nucleon moving in the weak ﬁelds which appear
in the standard Schrodinger description. More precisely, the description relation relating
the energy and momentum of a nuclear quasiparticle is similar to that of the Schrodinger
theory. Therefore, the system may be said to exhibit “hidden” relativity.

Indeed, for decades the Schrodinger approach to nuclear structure physics provided a
reasonably satisfactory model of nuclear dynamics. It is only in the last decade that the
true relativistic features of the system have become apparent.

We write the Dirac equation for a nucleon in the nuclear matter as

[~α.~p + γ0m + V (~p)]φ(~p, s) = ǫφ(~p, s),

where V (~p) is the potential. It will be useful to introduce the self-energy Σ(~p) = γ0V (~p)
and rewrite this equation as

[~γ.~p + m + Σ(~p)]φ(~p, s) = γ0ǫφ(~p, s).

Now let us assume that the self-energy is of the form

Σ(~p) = A + γ0B,

so that we have

[~γ.~p + (m + A)]φ(~p, s) = γ0(ǫ

B)φ(~p, s).

A positive-energy spinor solution of this equation is

Now, as we have mentioned, A is large and negative (

400 MeV) and B is large
and positive (300 MeV). Therefore A and B largely cancel and the dispersion relation
is essentially the same as that which one could ﬁnd in a nonrelativistic model. The
development of this simple relativistic nuclear model leads to two categories. The ﬁrst
we will call Dirac Phenomenology. This category is distinguished by having several free
parameters which are adjusted to ﬁt nuclear date. The second category will be called
Relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory and is characterized as having no
free parameters other than those introduced in ﬁtting free - space nucleon - nucleon
Interest in the development of the RBHF approximation grew out of
scattering data.
the successful application of Dirac phenomenology to the description of nucleon - nucleus
scattering data.

We have so far presented only the main idea and the materials necessary to our con-
sideration. For those who are interested to the detailed results of the relativistic nuclear
physics, please, see the monograph of Celenza and Shakin quoted above and the references
herein.

1.3 Bag Model of Baryons

It is well accepted QCD is the theory of strong interactions. However, in general, QCD is
never solvable: at low energies and small momenta transfer the running coupling constant
αs > 1. The bag model, outlined for the ﬁrst time by the group of M.I.T. theorists [3],
is a phenomenological approach, in which two basic features of QCD are incorporated:
asymptotic freedom and conﬁnement.

The main assumption of the M.I.T. bag model states that, baryon is considered to be
a bag of spherical shape, in which the constituent quarks move freely and are described
by the Dirac equation

with the Hamiltonian

Consider the case k =

Thus, the density certainly does not vanish at r = R. Clearly, although the lower
component is suppressed for small r, it does make a sizeable contribution near the surface
of the bag. Of course it is natural to ask whether this is not unusual in comparison with
nonrelativistic experience, where ψ(R) would be zero. However, such a solution would
not be consistent with the linear Dirac equation. What counts is that there should be no
current ﬂow through the surface of the conﬁning region. For example, in the MIT bag
model it is required that

at the surface - where nµ is a unit four vector normal to the surface of the conﬁning region.

In the MIT bag model this condition is imposed through a linear boundary condition

and hence

where

We consider the energy-momentum tensor for a model,

and T µν is the familiar energy-momentum tensor for a free Dirac ﬁeld

The condition for overall energy and momentum conservation is that the divergence
of the energy-momentum tensor should vanish, and this is certainly true for T µν, as is
easily proven from the free Dirac equation

However, the fact that these quarks move freely only inside the restricted region of

space V leads to problems. Indeed,

Bag Model of Nuclei (Z = N )

2.1 Main Assumption

We consider the simplest possible case of A baryons moving inside a spherical volume of
radius R, outside of which there is a pressure exerted on the nuclear surface.

Let us therefore begin with the Dirac equation for a baryon of mass M:

where Σ is the baryon self-energy having the form

(iγµ∂µ −

M

−

Σ)ψ(xµ) = 0,

Σ = φ + γµVµ.

Inserting (2.2) into (2.1) we obtain the equation

[γµ(i∂µ −

−

Vµ)

(M + φ)]ψ(xµ) = 0.

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

Eq.

(2.3) is nonlinear quantum ﬁeld equation and its exact solution is very com-
plicated. We have therefore made little progress by writing down this equation with a
suitable method for solving it.

In the MFT,

φ

For a static, uniform system the quantities φ0 and V0 are constants. Hence, the Dirac
equation is linear,

(2.4)
(2.5)

[iγµ∂µ −

(2.6)

and may be solved directly.

Our basic assumption is formulated: the nucleus A is considered to be a MIT bag,
inside of which the motion of nucleon is described by the Dirac equation (2.6). The
quantities φ0 and V0 can be determined only after we have ﬁtted to experimental data.

12

Let us next consider the energy-momentum conservation for nuclear bag. For stable
nuclei, there should be no current ﬂow through the surface of the conﬁning region. In the
MIT bag model it is required that

inµJ µ =

ψψ = ψψ = 0

−

(2.7)

at the surface, where nµ is a unit four vector normal to the surface of the conﬁning region.
Thus, ψψ which should vanish at the boundary in a relativistic theory. The matching
condition of the present model is exactly equivalent to the linear boundary condition for
the static spherical MIT bag.

introduction of a constant surface tension B involves no new parameters.

2.2 Wave Function for Baryon

The Dirac equation for the present model is linear and may be solved directly. We seek
normal-mode solutions of the form

ψ(xµ) = ψ(~r)e−iEtθV .

The Dirac equation then becomes

V0 shifts the frequency (or energy) of the baryon,

2.3 Radius and Binding Energy of Nuclei

We have seen that the only change in the calculation of the energy in the MIT bag model
for nuclei is the addition of a surface term, BS.
It is assumed that B is a universal
constant, chosen to ﬁt one piece of data. Once B is chosen, because of the nonlinear
boundary condition the radius of the bag is uniquely determined for each nuclei.

The meaning of this addition to energy-momentum tensor can be clariﬁed by consid-

ering the total energy of the bag state,

P 0

≡

E(A) =

d3x T 00

Bag =

Z

d3x (T 00θV + BθS),

(2.42)

which we shall label E(A) as a precursor to our discussion of binding energy later. Based
on (2.35) and (2.42) the nuclear energy E(A) is derived immediately

E(A) = AEa + 4πR2B

= A

(2.43)

The ﬁrst term is the kinetic energy, while the second is a surface term. Essentially it
implies that it cost an energy BS to make this tension at the bag surface within which

the baryons move. It should be intuitively clear that energy-momentum conservation is
related to pressure balance at the bag surface, so that a small change in radius should not
signiﬁcantly increase E(A). Nevertheless, the nonlinear boundary condition implies that

= 0.

We wish to stress that it is an assumption of the model that B should be constant for

Clearly, the remarkable result obtained for the binding energy per nucleon of the bag

model of nuclei was indeed a coincidence.

nucleon reads

a1 = 16.9177,

a2 = 19.120,

a3 = 101.777,

a4 = 0.7627.

Now let us indicate that (2.51) is possibly derived from our model if the parameters
φ0, V0 and B are ﬁtted adequately. Next confronting (2.50) with (2.51) we conclude that
the above mentioned parameters must fulﬁl equalities,

It is worth to notice that parameter V0 is explicitly deﬁned by (2.52). The equation

(2.53) constrains two unknown parameters of the theory, φ0 and V0.

The ﬁnal term in Eq. (2.50) represents the contribution to the surface energy from
the positive-frequency states, where the mass has been shifted by the constant, condensed
scalar ﬁeld φ0. φ0 (or the eﬀective mass M ∗ = M +φ0 depends explicitly on the scalar ﬁeld)
is a dynamical quantity that must be calculated self-consistently using the thermodynamic
argument that an isolated system at ﬁxed A and V (and zero temperature) will minimize
its energy:

However, φ0 is related to ωa by the relation (2.34). As a consequence, (2.54) is replaced

by conditions:

∂E(A, V ; φ0)

This model problem is exactly solvable. It retains the essential features of the bag
model for nuclei: A-dependence of nuclear radius and the formula for nuclear binding
energy. Furthermore, it yields a simple solution to the ﬁeld equation. This solution
and model problem thus provide a meaningful starting point for describing the nuclear
many-body system as well as a consistent basis for considering nuclei with N

relativistic nuclear physics, the bag model and standard many-body techniques.

parameters φ0, V0, b3, and A0 will be ﬁtted to experimental data.

Let us next consider the energy-momentum conservation for nuclear bag. Let T µν be
the energy-momentum tensor of nucleon, described by Eq. (3.4), inside the bag. Then
the total energy-momentum tensor T µν

Bag of the nucleus is clearly given by

Bag = T µνθV + BθS,

The above obtained formula (3.27) is well known in nuclear physics. It is one of the

main successes of our model.

3.3 Weizssacker Formula

As was known, the semi-empiric formula of Weizssacker [7, 10] for binding energy per
nucleon reads

(3.30)

in which a1, a2, a3, and a4 take the following values, in the energy unit equal to 0.9311
MeV,

a1 = 16.9177,

a2 = 19.120,

a3 = 101.777,

and

The charge distribution radius r0 for almost nuclei is ﬁtted to be

(3.30) agrees well with experimental data for most nuclei.

Now let us indicate that (3.30) is possibly derived from our model if the parameters
φ0, V0, b3, A0, and B are ﬁtted adequately. For this end, let us substitute (3.27) into
(3.25),

(3.34)

(3.36)

It is clear that (3.33) and (3.36) express directly the physical meaning of b3 and A0:

– The mean ﬁeld value b3 is proportional to the relative ratio of the numbers of protons

and neutrons, contained in nucleus A.

26

– The mean value of Coulomb potential created by Z protons equals to that created
by a sphere of charge Ze, embedded in a nuclear medium, the dielectric coeﬃcient
of which is 3r0/5rc.

It is worth to notice that three parameters V0, b3, and A0 are explicitly deﬁned by
(3.33), (3.35), and (3.36). The equation (3.34) contains two unknown parameters of the
theory, φ0 and B. As was shown in the Walecka theory [1], φ0 is a dynamical quality and
therefore it is deﬁned self-consistently. Namely, we use the thermodynamic argument that
an isolated system with ﬁxed baryon number A and volume V will minimize its energy,

However, φ0 is related to Ωp and Ωn by the relations (3.19) and (3.20). As a conse-

quence, (3.37) is replaced by the conditions:

Chapter 4

Conclusion and Discussion

In the previous sections the basic assumptions and the general results of our bag model
for nuclei are presented in detail. The model is built on a simple hypothesis: the nucleus
is considered to be a MIT bag, in which the motion of nucleons is described by the Dirac
equation and the mean ﬁeld values φ0, V0, b3, and A0 are supposed to be constants. In
addition to these mean ﬁelds, there exists the surface tension B of the bag that guarantees
the energy-momentum conservation.

Two major successes are: the formula (3.27) for the nuclear radius R and the Weizs-
sacker formula with the parameters veriﬁed in (3.33-36). All the parameters appearing in
the theory φ0, V0, b3, A0, and B are, in principle, determined by the equations (3.33-36),
(3.19, 20), and (3.41). Thus, our theory is a mathematically closed system. The devel-
opment of the formalism suggested here will be carried out for various concrete nuclei in
next papers.

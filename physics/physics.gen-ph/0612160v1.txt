spherosymmetric gravitational collapses with a time-dependent pressure
end in bodies with a small, but ﬁnite volume. Against a diﬀuse, wrong
conviction.

1. – The ﬁctitiousness of the notion of black hole (BH) has been demon-
strated with many arguments [1]. However, the majority of the astrophysi-
cists are still convinced of the real existence of the BH’s, in particular of the
supermassive BH’s: thus, “A quasar is thought to be powered by the infall
of matter onto a massive black hole at the centre of a massive galaxy” [2].
(See also [2bis]). In reality, all the claimed observational discoveries of BH’s
show only the existence of very large, or enormous, masses concentrated in
relatively small volumes (see, e.g., [3]). The discovery of the bright quasar
HE 0450-2958 (some 5 billion light-years away), which does not reside in the
centre of a massive host galaxy, has generated some interpretative diﬃculty.
According to an explanation of the authors of the paper quoted in [2], “the
black hole of HE 0450-2958 lies in a galaxy with not only a stellar content
much lower than average, but also with a dark halo . . .”.

In the present paper we give a new argument against the physical reality of
the BH’s: we show that a suﬃciently realistic computation of the relativistic
gravitational collapse of a massive (or supermassive) object yields as a ﬁnal
product a body with a small, but ﬁnite volume. We infer, in particular, that
the quasar phenomenon is a consequence of a permanent inward mass ﬂow
of a galactic origin, which accumulates onto a supermassive body restricted
within a ﬁnite, small volume.

An important by-product of our computation is the following: our internal
solution conﬁrms a general fact (see [4] and references therein), which con-
tradicts a widespread, naive opinion: the accelerated motions of the matter

particles of our collapsing body do not generate gravitational waves (GW’s);
these particles describe geodesic lines. [5].

A last remark, which concerns the concept of gravitational potential en-
ergy in general relativity (GR): this concept is extraneous to the spirit of
GR, for the simple reason that it cannot be formulated in a tensorial manner.
Here a (partial) analogy with Poynting theorem of Maxwell electrodynamics
is enlightening: the energy of a closed system of charged particles that are
in motion under the action of their e.m. ﬁelds is composed of two parts: the
total kinetic energy of the charges plus the energy of the global e.m. ﬁeld;
the consideration of the instantaneous Coulombian interactions between the
particles destroys the manifest Lorentzian covariance. Nevertheless, the
Newtonian concept of gravitational potential energy is practically useful –
and theoretically sensible – in several astrophysical instances: e.g., if we as-
sume, with a good approximation, that the potential energy of any spherical
mass M of radius R is GM 2/R (where G is the gravitational constant), we
have an energy of 1060 erg when M = 108 solar masses and R = 3.8 × 104
solar radii, with an average density of 2.57 × 10−6 g/cm3; the same potential
energy is obtained for M = 106 solar masses and R = 3.8 solar radii, with a
density of 2.57 × 104 g/cm3 (see further [6]).

2. – With standard notations, the (pre-relativistic) Euler equation of perfect
ﬂuids and the continuity equation are, as it is well known [µ = µ(r, t), p =
p(r, t)]:

a mere time dependence of pressure, p = p(t), is here of a scarce interest.
On the contrary, in the theory of relativity such time dependence can have
important physical consequences – as we shall see in the sequel. For the time
being, we limit ourselves to remember that in special relativity (SR) we have
the following Eulerian equations (j = 0, 1, 2, 3); uj is the four-velocity:

3. – An interesting essay on the gravitational collapses of massive celestial
bodies of a spherical shape has been written by McVittie in 1964 [6]. Subse-
quent authors have strangely ignored his results. It is here suﬃcient to cite
a paper by May and White (1966) [7] and a review article by Chandrasekhar

(1972) [8], because their erroneous conclusion that any relativistic gravita-
tional collapse of a spherical body ends always in a BH has become a caput
doctrinae sacrae for the astrophysical community.

In a previous paper [1] we have proved that an appropriate treatment of
relativistic gravitational collapses with zero pressure yields ﬁnally a point
mass, not a BH. By revisiting and completing a result by McVittie [6], we
shall show that relativistic gravitational collapses of spherical bodies with
pressure and density which are functions of the time alone end in objects of
a ﬁnite volume. It is evident that a computation with pressure and density
which are functions of time and of radial co-ordinate would strengthen this
result. It contradicts the statement of Chandrasekhar [8] that in GR the
allowance for pressure does not prevent the matter from collapsing to a BH.
We shall see in sect.6 the reason of this Chandrasekhar’s error, which is
really a double error.

4. – We adopt notations (with some inessential modiﬁcation), units of mea-
sure (CGS-system), and internal reference frame as in [6]. The problem: to
study a relativistic gravitational collapse with spherical symmetry under the
assumption that matter density and pressure are only time-dependent.

In a Gaussian-normal (or synchronous) and co-moving reference system,
we can write, assuming – for simplicity’s sake only – that the constant spatial
curvature κ is equal to zero (FRW metric with κ = 0):

where: τ := t/T , and T is a ﬁxed time interval, whose physical meaning
will be clear presently; the function S(τ ) will be determined as a solution
of Einstein ﬁeld equations. We assume that at the initial instant (t = 0) of
the collapse S(0) ≡ S0 = 1.

The celestial material is a perfect ﬂuid of density ̺(τ ) and pressure p(τ ).
The only components of mass tensor Tjk, (j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3), which are diﬀer-

It follows from eq.(4) that the volume of our spherical body is equal to
(4/3) π [S(τ ) rb]3, where rb is the radial co-ordinate of the boundary; since
this volume is contracting, the derivative Sτ (τ ) is negative. Accordingly,
from eq.(7) we obtain

consequently, at the ﬁnal stage of the collapse our body has a ﬁnite

i.e. a zero ﬁnal volume and a duration of collapse greater than T .
From a conceptual standpoint, we could stop here: the above (internal)
solution is completely exhaustive: if p = p(t) 6= 0 at the end of the collapse
the body has a ﬁnite volume.

However, it has become customary, in the investigations of gravitational
collapses, to study also the external solution of the problem, i.e. the gravi-
tational potential gjk outside of the collapsing object. But here McVittie’s
approach met with an unexpected diﬃculty: the continuity adjustment of
the two solutions (internal and external) at the boundary of the material
sphere succeeded only for the zero-pressure collapses. In the more interest-
ing case of a non-zero pressure p = p(t) it failed. Our author wrote [6]: “It
may, of course, be true that other forms of external solution exist [. . . that ]
might insure the continuity at the boundary [in all the considered instances].
If such form exists, I am not aware that they have been discovered.”

4bis. – Equation (11) is the equation of state of a given polytropic model
of the celestial material. For our problem it is, of course, a little schematic
model. However, polytropic equations are not infrequently adopted also for
material densities above those of nuclear matter, owing to the uncertainties
concerning the real equation of state in such cases.

We think that our ﬁnal result – i.e., the collapse to a ﬁnite volume – is

qualitatively independent of the precise structure of the equation of state.

5. – A physically interesting and general form of external solution has been
given by Eddington at p.94 of his treatise [10]:

here: m ≡ GM/c2; M is the mass of the spherical distribution of matter;

f (r) is any regular function of the radial co-ordinate r.

Strictly speaking, eq.(17) was derived by Eddington under the assumption
that the gravitational ﬁeld is generated by a point mass at rest. But it is
obvious that, with suitable choices for f (r), it holds also for the outside of
any spherical distribution at rest– or even in any spherosymmetrical motion,
by virtue of a well-known Birkhoﬀ’s theorem.

Examples. – For a material point: if f (r) ≡ r, we have the form of so-
lution by Hilbert, Droste, Weyl, the so-called standard form (improperly
denominated “by Schwarzschild”); for f (r) ≡ [r3 + (2m)3]1/3, we have the
original Schwarzschild form [11]; for f (r) ≡ r + 2m, we have a form which
was ﬁrst investigated by M. Brillouin; etc. etc. For a sphere of an incom-
pressible ﬂuid Schwarzschild [12] found an internal and an external solution;
the latter can be formally obtained from (17) by putting f (r) ≡ [r3 + δ3]1/3,
where the constant δ 6= 2m is given by his formula (33). N.B.: the constant δ
– denoted with ̺ by Schwarzschild – is diﬀerent from 2m as a consequence of

6

TIZIANA MARSICO AND ANGELO LOINGER

the fact that, in perfect analogy with Newton theory, He prescribed continu-
ity conditions on the boundary of the sphere both for gjk and for ∂gjk/∂xα,
(α = 1, 2, 3). –

Owing to the “ﬂexibility” of eq.(17), it is certain that there exist func-
tions f (r) which are apt to describe correctly the outside of any collapsing
spherical body for which eq.(4) is valid. However, eq.(17) is not written in a
Gaussian-normal and co-moving frame as eq.(4) is. Therefore, to verify the
existence (or non-existence) of continuity conditions on the periphery of the
sphere we should transform eq.(4) into the generic Eddington’s reference
system, or vice-versa eq.(17) into a Gaussian-normal form. To our aims,
we can avoid this tedious procedure, the following trivial argument being
suﬃcient to rule out the possibility of a collapse to a BH. Indeed, the values
S(τ ′), S(τ ′′), . . . of function S(τ ) at diﬀerent times t′, t′′ . . . of the Gaussian
frame of eq.(4) have corresponding values, say f (r[b′]), f (r[b′′]), . . . – where
r[b′], r[b′′], . . . are radial co-ordinates of the spherical boundary b – in the
reference system of eq.(17). In particular, Sf in has a corresponding value
f (r[bf in]) in Eddington’s frame. Now, any function f (r) in eq.(17), which
does not originate an event horizon, excludes ipso facto the ﬁctive notion of
BH.

Even if in the present problem GR did not allow a continuity adjustment,
the above reasoning would remain adequate to our purpose: to demonstrate
the unreality of the BH’s.

6. – We can see now the origin of the double error by Chandrasekhar [8],
i.e. of his assertion that a non-zero pressure does not hinder the spherical
body from collapsing into a BH.

1/3

First of all, we observe that the original form of solution given by Schwarz-
schild [11] for a point mass (and which can be formally obtained by putting
f (r) ≡ [r3 + (2m)3]
in eq.(17)) is everywhere regular, with the only ex-
ception of the origin r = 0: there is here no room for the fantastic notion of
BH. However, in the relativistic literature has prevailed the HDW-standard
form of solution, for which f (r) ≡ r. The Schwarzschildian form is diﬀeo-
morphic to standard form only if this form is considered for r > 2m. This
is no physical restriction – and only for r > 2m one can call (with admis-
sible impropriety) “by Schwarzschild” the standard form. Obviously, the
condition r > 2m is suﬃcient to exclude the BH, whose ﬁctitiousness can
be proved in several ways. The simplest one is as follows: the existence of
the BH’s would demand that, in the internal region of the singular surface
r = 2m, the radial co-ordinate r (which was chosen so that the area of the
surface r = const be 4π(const2) became a time co-ordinate; and vice-versa:
a mathematical and physical absurdity, as it was stressed by Nathan Rosen.
We remember ﬁnally that no physical result depends on the choice of the
function f (r) – provided that, of course, we exclude the ﬁctive singularities.
Chandrasekhar was a convinced believer in the real existence of the BH’s
(ﬁrst error), and this conviction had a momentous consequence for the pro-
blem of a collapsing sphere, since he wrote: “There is no alternative to
the matter collapsing to inﬁnite density at a singularity once a point of no
return [an event horizon, the surface r = 2m of the standard form of the

GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSES TO BODIES OF A FINITE VOLUME

7

In this way, the ﬁnal result of the collapse
external solution] is passed”.
would be the same as in a zero-pressure case (second error). The two errors
have a unique origin: the belief that the standard form has a mathematical
and physical meaning even for r ≤ 2m. It seems that Chandrasekhar and
the great majority of the astrophysicists have not read, in particular, the
fundamental memoirs by Schwarzschild ([11], [12]) and Eddington’s treatise
[10]. (A tentative psychological explanation: perhaps Chandrasekhar and
followers have been misled by an improper interpretation of the usual ver-
sion of Birkhoﬀ’s theorem, i.e. by the assertion that the time-independent
standard form is valid outside of any spherical distribution of matter. But
they have forgotten that for the Fathers of Relativity this form holds – and
for good reasons – only for r > 2m [13].

In conclusion: according to Chandrasekhar and followers, the ﬁnal re-
sult of all spherical gravitational collapses is always a BH, both for p = 0
and for p 6= 0. On the contrary, we have demonstrated (see [1] and previous
sect.4) that when p = 0 the ﬁnal stage of collapse is simply a material point,
not a BH; and when p = p(t) 6= 0 is a body of a small, but ﬁnite volume
(see sect.4).

APPENDIX

With regard to the last term at the right side of eqs.(3), Einstein empha-
sized that it is absent in pre-relativistic hydrodynamics [14]. However, its
contribution to gravitational collapses, although small, is not negligible, as
we have seen.

It seems a little queer that Chandrasekhar and followers have preferred
to direct their attention on the various kinds of singularities of Einsteinian
ﬁelds [15] rather than try to solve precise problems on the gravitational
collapses, as McVittie did.

On the other hand, it is obvious that accurate results proving that GR
does not represent an overturning of Newton theory, but a reﬁnement and a
completion of it, do not impress the public opinion and the politicians, who
decide the ﬁnancing of scientiﬁc researches. On the contrary, the belief in
ﬁctive notions (as the BH’s) and in physically unreal entities (as the GW’s)
favours fanciful divagations that stir up popular curiosity and ´epatent les
bourgeouis.

Immediately after the turning of tide, we shall assist at amusing theatrical

recriminations.

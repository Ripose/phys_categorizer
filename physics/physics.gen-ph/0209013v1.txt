Abstract

A new information-theoretic modelling of reality has given rise to a quantum-foam de-
scription of space, relative to which absolute motion is meaningful.
In a previous paper
(Cahill and Kitto) it was shown that in this new physics Michelson interferometers show
absolute motion eﬀects when operated in dielectric mode, as indeed such experiments had
indicated, and analysis of the experimental data showed that the measured speeds were all
consistent with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole-ﬁt speed of 369km/s. Here
the new physics is applied to the Michelson-Morley 1887 interferometer rotation curve data
to demonstrate that the interferometer data is in excellent agreement with the CMB direc-

by the in-ﬂow of the quantum foam past the Earth towards the Sun at 30

analysis of the Miller interferometer data of 1933 gives 49km/s, compared to the theoretical
value of 42km/s. This observed in-ﬂow is a signature of quantum gravity eﬀects in the new
physics.

1. Introduction

A new information-theoretic modelling of reality known as Process Physics [1, 2] and [14-17]
has given rise to a quantum-foam description of space, relative to which absolute motion is
meaningful and measurable. In Ref.[3] it was shown that in this new physics Michelson interfer-
ometers [4] reveal absolute motion when operated in dielectric mode, as indeed experiments had
indicated, and analysis [3] of the experimental data using the M´unera [5] review of that data
showed that the measured speeds were consistent with each other and together also consistent
with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole-ﬁt speed of 369km/s [6]. The new physics
is here further tested against experiment by analysing the Michelson-Morley interferometer ro-
tation data [7] of 1887 to demonstrate that the data is in excellent agreement with the CMB
cosmic velocity of the Solar System through space. As well as the orbital speed of the Earth
the analysis reveals a quantum-foam in-ﬂow towards the Sun associated with quantum-gravity
eﬀects in the new physics. So the CMB preferred frame is detectable in non-microwave labo-
ratory experiments. These results amount to a dramatic development in fundamental physics.
It is also shown that analysis of the extensive 1925-1926 dielectric-mode interferometer data by
Miller [8] resulted in an incorrect direction at 900 to the CMB direction.

Although the theory and experiment together indicate that absolute motion is an aspect
of reality one must hasten to note that this theory also implies that the Einstein Special and
General Theory of Relativity formalism remains essentially intact, although the ontology is
In [1] it was shown that this formalism arises from the quantum-foam

physics, but that the quantum-foam system leads to a physically real foliation of the spacetime
construct. Despite this there are some phenomena which are outside the Einstein formalism,
namely the detection of absolute motion. We see here the emergence of a new theoretical system
which subsumes the older theory and covers new phenomena, in particular it uniﬁes gravity and
the quantum phenomena.

The new physics provides a diﬀerent account of the Michelson interferometer. The main
outcome is the presence of the k2 factor in the expression for the time diﬀerence for light
travelling via the orthogonal arms

cos(2θ).

∆t = k2 L

vP
|
c3
Here vP is the projection of the absolute velocity v of the interferometer through the quantum-
foam onto the plane of the interferometer, and θ is the angle of one arm relative to vP . The k2
factor is k2 = n(n2
1) where n is the refractive index of the medium through which the light
passes, L is the length of each arm and c is the speed of light relative to the quantum foam. This
expression follows from both the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect and that the speed of light
through the dielectric is V = c/n, ignoring here for simplicity any drag eﬀects. This is one of
the aspects of the quantum foam physics that distinguishes it from the Einstein formalism. The
time diﬀerence ∆t is revealed by the fringe shifts on rotating the interferometer. In Newtonian
physics, that is with no Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction, k2 = n3, while in Einsteinian physics
k = 0 reﬂecting the fundamental assumption that absolute motion is not measurable and indeed
has no meaning. So the experimentally determined value of k is a key test of fundamental
physics.

Table 1 summarises the diﬀerences between the three fundamental theories in their mod-
elling of time, space, gravity and the quantum, together with their distinctive values for the
interferometer parameter k2. In particular the Process Physics uses a non-geometric iterative
modelling of time in a pre-geometric system from which a quantum foam description of space

2

is emergent. This quantum foam and quantum matter are together described by a Quantum
Homotopic Field Theory. Gravity in this modelling is caused by the inhomgeneous ﬂow of the
quantum foam. So Process Physics is a uniﬁcation of the quantum and gravity. Each theory
subsumes and accounts for the theory above it in the table. In particular the Einstein spacetime
modelling arises as an approximation to the Process Physics, but with a preferred frame of
reference or foliation.

Table 1: Comparisons of Newtonian, Einsteinian and Process Physics.

Here we derive (1) in the new physics and then analyse the Michelson-Morley and Miller
data. The results reported here are that the small eﬀects (fractional fringe shifts) actually seen
by Michelson and Morley [7] and by Miller [8] indicate speeds in agreement with the CMB speed.
This amounts to the observation of absolute motion. This non-null experimental signature then
clearly distinguishes between the three theories in Table 1.

In deriving (1) in the new physics it is essential to note that space is a quantum-foam system
[1, 2] which exhibits various subtle features.
In particular it exhibits real dynamical eﬀects
on clocks and rods. In this physics the speed of light is only c relative to the quantum-foam,
but to observers moving with respect to this quantum-foam the speed appears to be still c,
but only because their clocks and rods are aﬀected by the quantum-foam. As shown in [1] such
observers will ﬁnd that records of observations of distant events will be described by the Einstein
spacetime formalism, but only if they restrict measurements to those achieved by using clocks,
rods and light pulses. It is simplest in the new physics to work in the quantum-foam frame of
reference. If there is a dielectric present at rest in this frame, such as air, then the speed of light
in this frame is V = c/n. If the dielectric is moving with respect to the quantum foam, as in an
interferometer attached to the Earth, then the speed of light relative to the quantum-foam is
still V = c/n up to corrections due to drag eﬀects. Hence this new physics requires a diﬀerent
method of analysis from that of the Einstein physics. With these cautions we now describe the
operation of a Michelson interferometer in this new physics, and show that it makes predictions
diﬀerent to that of the Einstein physics. Of course experimental evidence is the ﬁnal arbiter in
this conﬂict of theories.

2. The Michelson Interferometer

As shown in Fig.1 the beamsplitter/mirror when at A sends a photon ψ(t) into a superposi-
tion ψ(t) = ψ1(t) + ψ2(t), with each component travelling in diﬀerent arms of the interferometer,
until they are recombined in the quantum detector which results in a localisation process, and
one spot in the detector is produced. Repeating with many photons reveals that the interference
between ψ1 and ψ2 at the detector results in fringes. To simplify the analysis here assume that
the two arms are constructed to have the same lengths L when they are physically parallel to
each other and perpendicular to v, so that the distance BB′ is L sin(θ). The Fitzgerald-Lorentz
eﬀect in the new physics is that the distance SB′ is γ−1L cos(θ) where γ = 1/
v2/c2. The
various other distances are AB = V tAB, BC = V tBC, AS = vtAB and SC = vtBC , where tAB

air = 0.00058 (i.e. kair = 0.0241) and for Helium k2

Of the early interferometer experiments Michelson and Morley [7] and Miller [8] operated in
air (n = 1.00029), while that of Illingworth [9] used Helium (n = 1.000035). We expect then
that for air interferometers k2
He = 0.00007,
which explains why these experiments reported very small but nevertheless non-null and so
signiﬁcant eﬀects. All non-vacuum experiments gave k > 0, that is, a non-null eﬀect. All
vacuum (n = 1) interferometer experiments, having k = 0, give null eﬀects as expected, but
such experiments cannot distinguish between the new physics and the Einstein physics, only
dielectric-mode interferometers can do that. The notion that the Michelson-Morley experiment
gave a null eﬀect is a common misunderstanding that has dominated physics for more than a
century. By “null eﬀect” they meant that the eﬀect was much smaller than expected, and the
cause for this is only now apparent from the above. When the air and Helium interferometer
data were re-analysed using the appropriate k values in [3] they gave consistent values which
were also consistent with the CMB speed. So these early interferometer experiments did indeed
reveal absolute motion, and demonstrated that k
= 0. Of the interferometer experimentalists
only Miller consistently argued that absolute motion had been detected, but failed to convince
the physics community.

The Michelson-Morley 1887 Experiment

Michelson and Morley reported [7] that their interferometer experiment in 1887 gave a “null-
result” which since then, with rare exceptions, has been claimed to support the Einstein as-
sumption that absolute motion has no meaning. However to the contrary the Michelson-Morley
published data [7] shows non-null eﬀects, but much smaller than they expected. They made ob-
servations of thirty-six 1800 turns using an L = 11 meter length air-interferometer in Cleveland
(Latitude 41030′N) with six turns at 12 :00 hrs (7:00 hrs ST) on each day of July 8, 9 and 11,
1887 and similarly at 18 :00 hrs (13:00 hrs ST) on July 8, 9 and 12, 1887. The fringe shifts
were extremely small but within their observational capabilities. The best 12 :00 and 18 :00 hr
rotation data are shown in Table 2. The dominant eﬀect was a uniform fringe drift caused by
temporal temperature eﬀects on the length of the arms. After correcting for this the best fringe
shifts for two 1800 turns are shown in Fig.2. The 18 :00 hr data on July 9 data is particularly
free of observational and vibrational errors, and was used here for detailed ﬁtting.

barely distinguishable from this best ﬁt so long as vin and vtangent are included. The dashed curves
shows analogous results using the Miller direction for vcosmic, which is in clear disagreement with the

in Fig.3(b) and in Table 3, and the ﬁt is graphed in Fig.2. The ﬁt is in excellent agreement with
the data and we conclude that vcosmic from the interferometer is the same as vCM B. Hence the
absolute motion detection capabilities of the Michelson interferometer are clearly evident when
used in conjunction with the new physics. In ﬁnding the best ﬁt we obtain that the magnitude
of vin is 30
15 km/s which is consistent with the theoretical value of 42 km/s. Fig.3b and
Fig.4 clearly show the determination of vin. This shows that the quantum-foam in-ﬂow eﬀect is

at 900 to the CMB/MM direction and is clearly inconsistent with the 12 :00 hr Michelson-Morley

from the intrinsic 900 directional ambiguity of the interferometer if continuity of the phase is

Nevertheless Miller’s extensive Mt.Wilson air-interferometer data with L = 64 m is capable
of conﬁrming some of the above results. Miller reported in [8] particular observations over four
days in 1925/26 recording the time variation of the projection vP of the velocity v onto the
interferometer throughout each of these days. Miller’s idea was that v should have only two
components: (i) a cosmic velocity of the Solar system through space, and (ii) the orbital velocity
of the Earth about the Sun. Over a year this vector sum would result in a changing v, as was in
fact observed. Further, since the orbital speed was known, Miller was able to extract from the

to incorrectly report their “null-result”.

2The Miller data was analysed in [10]. It now appears that Miller failed to carefully track the diurnal changes
in the azimuth ψ. Around 11:00 hrs sidereal time there is a rapid change in ψ, and this was not detected by
Miller.

led to the conclusion that for reasons unknown the interferometer did not indicate true values
of vP , and for this reason he introduced the parameter k (we shall denote his values by k).
Miller noted, in fact, that k
<< 1. Fitting his data Miller found k = 0.046 and v = 210km/s
and the direction shown in Table 3. However that k > kair now conﬁrms that another velocity
component has been overlooked. Miller only knew of the tangential orbital speed of the Earth,
whereas the new physics predicts that as-well there is a quantum-gravity radial in-ﬂow vin of the
quantum foam. We can re-analyse Miller’s data to extract the speed of this in-ﬂow component.

Using the above k value and the value of kair we obtain vin = 49 km/s, which is again in good
agreement with the theoretical value of 42 km/s. Since it is vR = √3vtangent and not vtangent
that sets the scale we must re-scale Miller’s value for v to be √3
210 = 364km/s, which now
compares favourably with the CMB speed. Hence Miller did indeed observe absolute motion as
he claimed but again, as for the Michelson-Morley data, the quantum gravity in-ﬂow eﬀect is
required in the analysis.

So the Michelson-Morley experiment actually amounted to the ﬁrst quantum gravity exper-
iment, and the ability of dielectric-mode interferometers to measure absolute motion made this
possible.

Conclusions

The various dielectric-mode interferometer experiments were never null and their data can
now be fully analysed within the new physics. This analysis reveals various aspects of the new
quantum-foam phenomena. The incorrect reporting by Michelson and Miller of a “null eﬀect”
was based on using the Newtonian value of k = 1 and on v being atleast 30km/s due to the
Earth’s orbital motion, and so predicting fringe shifts 10 times larger than actually seen (the true
value for v2 in (1) is some 102 larger but the dielectric eﬀect gives a reduction of approximately
1/1000). Of course that Michelson and Morley saw any eﬀect is solely due to the presence of the
air in their interferometer. Vacuum interferometer experiments of the same era by Joos [11] gave
vM < 1km/s, and are consistent with a null eﬀect as predicted by the quantum-foam physics. If
Michelson and Morley had more carefully reported their results the history of physics over the
last 100 years would have been totally diﬀerent.

The experimental results analysed herein and in [3] show that absolute motion is detectable.
This is motion with respect to a quantum-foam system that is space. As well quantum matter
eﬀectively acts as a sink for the quantum-foam, and the ﬂow of that quantum-foam towards
the Sun has been conﬁrmed by the data. These results are in conﬂict with the fundamental
assumption by Einstein that absolute motion has no meaning and so cannot be measured. Vac-
uum interferometer experiments do give null results, for example see [11, 12, 13, 14], but they
only check the Lorentz contraction eﬀect, and this is common to both theories. So they are
unable to distinguish the new physics from the Einstein physics. As well that the interferometer
experiments and their results fall into two classes, namely vacuum and dielectric has gone un-
noticed. The non-null results from dielectric-mode interferometers have always been rejected on
the grounds that they would be in conﬂict with the many successes of the Special and General
Theory of Relativity. However this is not strictly so, and it turns out that these successes survive
in the new physics, which actually subsumes the Einstein formalism, even though the absolute
motion eﬀect is not in the Einstein physics. Einstein essentially arrived at a valid formalism
from a wrong assumption. The new more encompassing process physics [1-3, 14-17] allows the
determination of a physically real foliation of the spacetime construct (the Panlev´e-Gullstrand
foliation) and so it actually breaks the diﬀeomorphism symmetry of General Relativity.

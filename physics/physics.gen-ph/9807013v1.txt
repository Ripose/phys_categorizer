I. ANSWERS

The neutrino theory of light has a long history [1]- [26]. Its crucial point was the Pryce
theorem [8] which brought a halt in the development of this branch of particle physics for a
long time. Namely, as showed Barbour et al. in the most elegant way, ref. [10], the Jordan’s
“ansatz”1

Aµ(k) =

1

0

Z

f (λ) ¯ψ((λ

1)k)γµψ(λk)dλ

−

was thought to be incompatible with the requirement of the transversality of a photon and/or
with the requirements of the correct statistics for a photon.

In the sixties some hopes on recreation emerged, the renaissance occurred. Berezinsky

writes [15]: “With a gauge transformation the amplitude of a photon state of the type:

m ¯ψ(τ k)γµψ(λk) =

ikµ

¯ψ(τ k)ψ(λk)

−
(λ and τ are numbers) can always be reduced to zero” and then he disagrees with I. M. Bar-
bour at al.: “In the four-component theory there is no diﬃculty in practically constructing
all transverse four-vectors from the wave functions of neutrinos with collinear momenta”.

Sen, ref. [11], writes: “ . . . the 2-component neutrino can also be completely described by
a self-dual antisymmetric tensor behaving very much like the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor.
What about the anti-self-dual case?. . . We have shown that the photon can be considered as
a combination of two neutrinos, one described by

and other by

(σk∂k + i∂4)φ = 0

(σ′k∂k + i∂4)χ = 0

(the set σ′k diﬀers from σk only by the interchange of the indices one and three) and that the
neutrinos described by (3) and (4) can be represented by a self-dual and an anti-self-dual
antisymmetric tensor, respectively. The two neutrinos will behave identically when they are
free but their interactions with other particles may be diﬀerent. The problem of how they
diﬀer in their interactions remains to be investigated.”

Bandyopadhyay, ref. [19], continues: “Perkins, ref. [13], considered the usual four-
component solutions with deﬁnite momentum and helicity of the Dirac equation with a
zero-mass term. He constructed in some special way the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor Fµν
of the two neutrino operators in the conﬁgurational space. In this formalism, the photon
appears as composed of the pair (ν1¯ν2) and (ν2¯ν1), where ν1 (ν2) denotes the neutrino with
spin parallel (antiparallel) to its momentum. However, the impossibility of constructing

Aµ(k) is the electromagnetic potential in the momentum space. Here k is the photon four-
4 matrices and ψ is the spin-1/2 ﬁeld operator. f (λ) is some suitable

momentum, γµ the usual 4
weight function. In the de Broglie theory one has f (λ) = δ(λ

a).

linearly polarized photons seems to be a very serious defect of this theory.. . . we can say
that the construction of the photon as a composite state of a neutrino-antineutrino pair has
remained a problem until now.”

Strazhev concludes [22]: “Neutrino and photon states realize the IR [irreducible repre-
sentations] of chiral group U(1) and all the relations that connect the neutrino and photon
operators must have deﬁnite transformation properties under chiral transformation. The
Aµ(k) are not dual invariants. At the same time the right side
electromagnetic potentials
of the expression (1) is an invariant of γ5 transformations. Of course, from the particular
solutions of the Dirac equation with mass m = 0 can be built the transversal four-vector
(Berezinsky, 1966, ref. [15]) . . . In this case, however, the condition of the relativistic invari-
ance will not be satisﬁed. So, we can formulate the Pryce theorem in the following way:
The requirements of the correct statistics and the correct transformation properties under
transformation of the group U(1) of the composite photons are incompatible in the neutrino
theory of light. In other words we can say that with the satisfaction of the requirement of
the relativistic and chiral invariance one can build from the neutrino only a photon with
unphysical longitudinal polarization.” .

A succeeding halt! . . .

II. THOUGHTS

I would still like to mention here: very unfortunately the paper of Sen [11] did not draw
almost any attention. I believe that it was in the needed direction. Furthermore, it is not
clear to me, why do peoples, speaking about the neutrino theory of light, used the Dirac ﬁeld
operator which describes charged particles? Finally, in the recent textbook on the quantum
ﬁeld theory [27] S. Weinberg indicated the possibility that the 4-vector potential can be used
to describe a scalar particle. . . So, it seems to me that some speculations about the problem,
which is overweighed by many confusions, would be desirable.

In ref. [15] the following assumptions have been made, under which one can have the

consistent neutrino theory of light.

“1. Let Uθ be an operator which in the space of neutrino state vectors describes a rotation

by angle θ around the direction of the momentum k as an axis. Then

Uθ ai(k) U −

θ = eiθ/2 ai(k)

, Uθ bi(k) U −

θ = e−

2. If the neutrinos are fermions, then the operators ai(k) and bi(k) obey the following

commutation relations:

All other anticommutators are equal to zero.2

3. There exist photons with right and left circular polarization, whose annihilation oper-

ators κ(p) and ω(p) have the following transformation properties:

the Majorana-McLennan-Case-like construct.

4. Simultaneously there exist photons with linear polarization, whose annihilation opera-
tors ξ(p) and η(p) are linear combinations of κ(p) and ω(p) and satisfy the transformation
relations

tions:

Equations (9) are the conditions for the photon to be genuinely neutral. No assumptions are
made about the equations for the photons or the neutrinos.”

i−

Strazhev, ref. [22], reformulated them in a following way: “ The operators of the massless
ﬁelds have the deﬁnite transformation rules under chiral (γ5) transformations; there exist
ﬁeld operators ~E, ~H that are transformed under dual transformations in accordance with

1

Uθ Φi U −
Uθ ˜Φi U −

θ = Φi cos θ + ˜Φi sin θ

θ =

,

−

(where i = 1, 2); a neutrino can be either a fermion or a parafermion particle; the com-
mutation relations of the operators of the photon ﬁelds are invariants under dual transfor-
mations. . . The last condition is an equivalent to the condition of the pure neutrality of the
photon by Berezinsky. . . We do not have a self-consistent neutrino theory of light if all these
conditions are satisﬁed. From our point of view, that means that the statistical properties
of the photon in the neutrino theory of light are inconsistent with the chiral (γ5) symmetry
of neutrino and electromagnetic ﬁelds.”

At this point I would like to remind recent results obtained in the framework of the
2(2j + 1) component theory [29]- [31], the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld description [32,33] and
in the Majorana theory of neutral particles [34,35].

where p1 =

“relativistic cockroach nest”, “as it appears inert so long as the particles are free, but
any interaction immediately brings levels at values E
= 0. The name [they] have given
to these levels comes from its analogy with a crack in a wall, which looks innocuous
under normal circumstances, but if food is put near it, i.e. in our case interaction, the
cockroaches start to come out... Analogy indicates that food near the crack will keep
the cockroaches there, and thus will not hamper our use of the rest of the wall.”

In ref. [40] an explicit construct of the Bargmann-Wightman-Wigner-type quantum
ﬁeld theory has been proposed in the (1, 0)
(0, 1) representation space of the Lorentz
⊕
group. The remarkable feature of this class of theories, envisaged in the sixties [42], is:
a boson and its antiboson can possess opposite relative intrinsic parities. The essential
ingredients of this model are: the choice of the spinorial basis (or, rather, of bivectors
in the zero-momentum frame) in the same manner like in the spin j = 1/2 case:4
φL( ◦pµ); and the use of the Wigner rules [44] for Lorentz transformations
φR( ◦pµ) =
of the right- (j, 0) and left- (0, j) handed spinors from the “rest”:

E. Chubykalo and R. Smirnov-Rueda [39] may also be connected with the problem at hand. The
situation is now similar to that which we encountered in the twenties. The explanation was required
in that time for negative-energy solutions in the famous equation for spin j = 1/2. In the opposite
case (if we would not ﬁnd a satisfactory interpretation for the E = 0 solution) we have to agree
with Weinberg [29b,p.B888]: “The fact that these ﬁeld equations are of ﬁrst order for any spin
seems to me to be of no great signiﬁcance...”

(0, 1) massless ﬁeld to be λ =

In the papers, refs. [49,52], the transversality (including a massless case) of the Wein-
berg (or antisymmetric tensor) ﬁelds has been proved. This statement opposes to the
conclusions of refs. [32,33,51] and of my previous paper [47b]. In those papers it was
claimed that the quantized massless antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld is longitudinal. What
are the origins of such a surprising result achieved in earlier articles? As a matter of
fact it contradicts with the classical formalism for antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld (i.e., with
the Correspondence Principle) and with the famous Weinberg theorem B
A = λ,
which allows the helicity of the (1, 0)
1. In the old
works several authors have applied the “generalized Lorentz condition” imposed on
the state vectors (see formulas (18) in ref. [32]). It is the “generalized Lorentz condi-
tion”, which coincides with the equations (12a,12b), that yields the puzzled dispersion
relation of the j = 1 massless ﬁeld (cf. with item # 1).The papers [49,52] reveal that
the use of the well-known equations (12a,12b) in the coordinate space may lead to
confusions such as equating the spin operator to zero. The result which is related
with our conclusion has been conﬁrmed by Evans [53] from diﬀerent standpoints. He
discussed origins of appearance of the B(3) longitudinal ﬁeld, which may be used to
obtain helicities
1. Unfortunately, formal calculations in Evans’ papers deserve care-
ful examination. In the paper [51] Avdeev and Chizhov analyzed this problem and
used the Lagrangian which is similar to our Lagrangian except for the total derivative.7
But, they concerned with the real part of the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld only and lost
the information about possible existence of the j = 1 antiparticle. Furthermore, in
the private communications Prof. L. Avdeev writes himself: “In perturbation theory
we systematically ignore any boundary eﬀects, although they may be of consequence
nonperturbatively.” Interesting discussion of the above-mentioned issues can be found
in ref. [54].

±

Thus, in the works [53,49,52] the contradiction between the “longitudinality” of the
antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld after quantization and the Weinberg theorem B
A = λ
has been partly clariﬁed.

have been introduced there. They are not eigenspinors of the helicity operator of the
(j, 0)
(0, j) representation; they describe the states which are not eigenstates of the
Parity operator; the self/anti-self charge conjugate states form a bi-orthonormal set
in a mathematical sense (see [28, Eqs.(41-45)] and my remark in the footnote # 2).
New fundamental wave equations have been proposed in the light-front formulation of
quantum ﬁeld theory [55] and in the instant form [28]. As a result of this consideration
it was found that they can describe fermions with the same intrinsic parities, ref. [56].
The example of such a kind of the theories has already been discussed in the old pa-
per [57], but with type-I (Dirac) spinors. Equations for self/anti-self charge conjugate
states recast into the covariant form (the “MAD” form of the Dirac equations, see

Their possible relevance to describing neutrino and photon states has been discussed.
Particularly, importance of the axial current has been stressed.

On the basis of these thoughts I am able to write the ansatzen substituting the de Broglie
(or Jordan) ansatz. By the direct examination one can prove on the classical level that the
4-vector potential of diﬀerent polarization states can be expressed (on using the second-type
spinors) as follows:8

Of course, one can repeat the derivation of the formulas of this paper on using the Dirac
4-spinors, thus arriving at the electron-positron theory of light. The room of choosing the
constants ai, bi, ci, di permits us to obtain various types of (anti)commutation relations for
the composite particles. Tensor currents have also been calculated. They are also composed
of the second-type 4-spinors. In my opinion, resulting expressions of the type F µν
σµν)νη′ (and its dual conjugates) also permit to construct the neutrino theory of light.

In a series of the works A. Barut et al. have shown that this formulation of quantum
electrodynamics (based on the iteration procedure, not on the perturbation theory) leads to
the same experimental predictions as the ordinary formalism.

Let me try to write the formula (24) in the momentum space (To my knowledge, there
1)t, λ

were no such attempts in the literature). I consider momenta as q = λt and p = (λ
is some function spanned from 0 to 1. In this case9

Surprisingly, you may see the well-known Jordan ansatz. Thus, referring to the remark of
the previous paragraph one can state the longitudinal de Broglie-Jordan-Barut potential can
describe quantumelectrodynamic processes suﬃciently good. In order to obtain transverse
components of the 4-vector potential one should set up the commutation relations for the
4-spinor ﬁeld, which are diﬀerent from those used in the Dirac theory.

III. QUESTIONS

This paper speculate about several versions of the construction of the composite parti-
cles from states of the (1/2, 0)
(0, 1/2) representation space. In fact, it is a continuation
of eﬀorts undertaken in old papers, refs. [11,13,17,22,29–31,34,35,62], and in the recent
ones [36,38,40,47–50,55,28,58,59,25]. I realize that not all the topics and not all the contra-
dictions have been considered here. A task of this paper was mainly to give a direction for
future researches and to present a basis for forthcoming publications.

⊕

Referring to phenomenological consequences of the theory, I would like to cite some para-
graphs from [17a]: “. . . in view of the neutrino theory of light, photons are likely to inter-
act weakly also, apart from the usual electromagnetic interactions. . . This assumed photon-
neutrino weak interaction, if it exists, will have important bearing on astrophysics. In fact,
this interaction can then be held responsible for the following neutrino-generating processes
in stars:

(1) γ + e−
e− + Z
(2)
e− + e+

(4) γ + γ
(5) γ + γ

.

Next, I would like to put the following problems forth:

•

•

•

In neutrino physics we have now most consistent indications for new physics [63,64].
What are the origins of negative mass-squared problem from a viewpoint of the pre-
sented model? Can the solar neutrino deﬁcit be caused by the processes mentioned
above (like ¯νν
2γ)? Perhaps, we should re-calculate the old of the Sun on the basis
of this model?

→

Can recently observed neutrino oscillations (for a reviews see ref. [65,58]) have some
relations with the presented model?

It is known that the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect, ref. [66], cannot be explained on the
basis of transversal electric and magnetic ﬁelds ~E and ~B. Other authors applied to
4-vector potential in order to explain it. Perhaps, the possibility of dual solutions Fµν

10

and ˜Fµν for the spin-1 ﬁeld and/or the existence of Majorana-like spinors have been
missed in previous attempts? Several recent publications indicate the possibility of
explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect on the basis of the longitudinal solutions of
electromagnetism [67] (cf. also ref. [68]).

We are sure there exist several other problems in the modern ﬁeld theory, which can be

related with the matters discussed in this paper.

Acknowledgements. I thank Prof. D. V. Ahluwalia whose papers helped me and who
gave an initial impulse to come back to these topics. I greatly appreciate communications
with A. F. Pashkov several years ago. His remarks have been deﬁnitely helpful to realise
new perspectives in the old theory. Perhaps, the presented results have been obtained (but,
unfortunately, not published) by him several years ago.

I am grateful to Zacatecas University for a professorship.

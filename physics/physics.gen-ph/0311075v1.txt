AGAIN ON THE NON-EXISTENCE
OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AND OF BLACK HOLES

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. Very straightforward arguments proving the physical non-
existence of GW’s and of BH’s. They are so simple that even the mem-
bers of the Wheelerian establishment will understand them.

An obvious premise: in (the exact, i.e. non-approximate [1]) general
relativity (GR) only the concepts and the results that are independent of
the choice of the system of general co-ordinates have a physical meaning.
i) Let us consider any solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations of GR which
has – in a given co-ordinate system – a deﬁnite undulatory character, i.e.
that represents a gravitational wave (GW). Now, through a ﬁnite sequence of
co-ordinate transformations, endowed with suitable undulating properties,
the primary wave character of our solution can be fully obliterated. Thus,
this character has no physical meaning, it is only a mathematical property
of the original co-ordinate system. Q.e.d. –

i’) A ﬁrst proof of the physical non-existence of the GW’s was given in
1917 by Tullio Levi-Civita [2]. Other proofs have been published in recent
years by the present writer [3].

ii) As it was remarked by Eddington [4], the solution of the problem of
the Einsteinian gravitational ﬁeld generated by a point mass M (at rest) is
given – if r, ϑ, ϕ are spherical polar co-ordinates – by the following spacetime
interval:

,

(cid:3)
where m ≡ GM/c2, and G is the gravitational constant; f (r) is any

(cid:2)

regular function of r.

Now, the invention of the black holes (BH’s) is due to a (mis)interpretation
of that form of solution (1) for which f (r) ≡ r:
it is the so-called stan-
dard solution, erroneously named “Schwarzschild solution”. In reality, Karl
Schwarzschild chose f (r) ≡ [r3 + (2m)3]1/3, see [5]; this original Schwarz-
schildean form is singular only at the spatial point r = 0. Thus, the notion
of BH does not have a physical meaning, it is only a (ﬁctive) by-product of
a very particular choice of the function f (r). Q.e.d. –

In course of publication on Spacetime & Substance.

Abstract

We discuss the applications of Gauge Theory Gravity (GTG) within
the language of geometric algebra to the Dirac equation in the de
Sitter and Rindler metrics as well as to the Unruh eﬀect. We rederive
the Hawking temperature for each case. The derivation of both the
correct Fermi-Dirac statistics as well as the Hawking temperature may
suggest that the method of calculations we employ here - geometric
algebra - is really powerful in dealing with the problems in various
gravitational backgrounds.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we will discuss the applications of gauge theory gravity (GTG)
[15] in the language of geometric algebra (as an introduction, see, e.g., [11,
6, 7]) on the Dirac equation on the de Sitter and Rindler backgrounds. The
approach which will be employed in this paper is actually semiclassical (see,
e.g., [12]), i.e., we use a quantum theory which is, in this case, represented by
the Dirac equation, with the classical backgrounds, which are the de Sitter
and Rindler spaces. Classical means, in this sense, continous, not quantal or
discrete.

In this paper we will concentrate our eﬀorts to do the calculations in the
spirit of geometric algebra. Here, the gravitational theory is formulated as
a gauge theory, i.e., gauge theory gravity (GTG) within the mathematical
language called geometric algebra. GTG provides a radically diﬀerent picture
of gravitational interactions from that of GR. But, the two theories agree in
their predictions over a wide range of phenomena. Important diﬀerences only
start to emerge upon global issues such as the role of topology and horizons,
and the interface with quantum theory. Geometric algebra which will be used
here is actually the optimal language to express GTG. The geometric algebra
of spacetime - or, the Space-Time Algebra (STA) [14] - not only simpliﬁes
much of the mathematics, but also brings the underlying physics to the fore.
We begin with a brief introduction to geometric algebra, STA, and GTG.

2 Geometric Algebra

This brief introduction to geometric algebra is intended to establish out no-
tation and conventions. More complete introduction may be found in [15]
and [14]. The basic idea is to extend the algebra of scalars to that of vectors.
We do this by introducing an associate (Cliﬀord) product over a graded lin-
ear space. We identify scalars with the grade 0 elements of this space, and
vectors with the grade 1 elements. Under this product scalars commute with
all elements, and vectors square to give scalars. If a and b are two vectors,
then we write the geometric (Cliﬀord) product as the juxtposition ab. This
product decomposes into a symmetric and an antisymmetric part, which de-
ﬁne the inner and outer products between vectors, denoted by a dot and a
wedge, respectively :

b is neither a scalar or a vector.
It is simple to show that a.b is a scalar, but a
It deﬁnes a new geometric element called a bivector (grade 2). This may be
regarded as a directed plane segment, which speciﬁes the plane containing a
ba for a
and b. Note that if a and b are parallel, then ab = ba, whilst ab =
and b perpendicular. This process may be repeated to generate higher grade
elements, and hence a basis for the linear space.

2.1 The Spacetime Algebra (STA)

The Spacetime Algebra is the geometric algebra of spacetime. This is familiar
to physicists as the algebra if the Dirac γ-matrices. The STA is generated
by four orthogonal vectors

generate the geometric algebra of Euclidean 3-space, and are isomorphic to
the Pauli matrices. They represent a frame of ’relative vectors’ (’relative’ to
the timelike vector γ0 used in their deﬁnition). The

four-dimensional spacetime, but 3-vectors in the relative 3-space orthogonal
to γ0.

An arbitrary real superposition of the basis elements (3) is called a ’mul-
tivector’, and these inherit the associative Cliﬀord product of the
gen-
erators. For a grade-r multivector Ar and a grade-s multivector Bs we deﬁne
the inner and outer products with

Physical equations, when written in the STA, always take the form

(11)

(12)

A(x) = B(x)

(10)

where A(x) and B(x) are multivector ﬁelds, and x is the four-dimensional
position vector in the (background) Minkowski spacetime. We demand that
the physical content of ﬁeld equations be invariant under arbitrary local
displacements of the ﬁelds in the background spacetime,

A(x)

A(x′), x′ = f (x),

7→

where f (x) a non-singular function of x. We further demand that the physical
content of the ﬁeld equations be invariant under an arbitrary local rotation

A(x)

RA(x) ˜R,

7→

with R a non-singular rotor-valued function of x. These demends are clearly
equivalent to requiring covariance (form-invariance under the above trans-
formation) of the ﬁeld equations. These requirements are automatically sat-
isﬁed for non-derivative relations, but to ensure covariance in the presence
of derivatives we must gauge the derivative in the background spacetime.
The gauge ﬁelds must transform suitably under (local) displacements and
rotations, to ensure covariance of the ﬁeld equations. This leads to the in-
troduction of two gauge ﬁelds : h(a) and Ω(a). The ﬁrst of these, h(a), is a
position-dependent linear function mapping the vector argument a to vectors.
The position dependence is usually left implicit. Its gauge-theoretic purpose
is to ensure covariance of the equations under arbitrary local displacements
of the matter ﬁelds in the background spacetime [15]. The second gauge
ﬁeld, Ω(a), is a position-dependent linear function which maps the vector a
to bivectors. Its introduction ensures covariance of the equation under local
rotations of vector and tensor ﬁelds, at a point, in the background spacetime.
Once this gauging has been carried out, and a suitable lagrangian for the
matter ﬁelds and gauge ﬁelds has been constructed, we ﬁnd that gravity has
been introduced. Despite this, we are still parameterising spacetime points
by vectors in a ﬂat background Minkowski spacetime. The covariance of the
ﬁeld equations ensures that the particular parameterisation we choose has
no physical signiﬁcance. The feature that is particularly relevant to this is
that we still have all the features of the ﬂat-space STA at our disposal. A

mations, the physical ﬁelds and the gauge ﬁelds will change, but this does not
alter physical predictions if we demand that such predictions be extracted
in a gauge-invariant manner. List of symmetry transformations which make
the action invariant is given in Table 1, while the conventions of GTG are

3 Dirac equation on the de Sitter metric

In this section we discuss the Dirac equation on the de Sitter background
[13, 9]. We employ the minimally coupled Dirac equation from [15, 5], which
is in this case

Next, we need to separate out the angular dependence. This can be done by
using the spherical monogenics [7]. Note that, from equation (24) to equation
(27) below, we temporarily employ Iσ3 instead of j; these after we use j for
Iσ3 again. The (unnormalized) monogenic is deﬁned by

Since s = 0 is always a solution of the indicial equation, solutions that are
analytic at the horizon always exist [15]. In [15] it is claimed that one can
calculate reﬂection coeﬃcients and scattering amplitudes by determining the
split between ingoing and outgoing states of these solutions. However, the
problem here is whether the second root can be physically signiﬁcant. We
now consider the ‘Hawking temperature’, which will be denoted by TH . In
these calculations we shall need the non-covariant conserved current (which
generates the streamlines whose curves are timelike) that can be expressed
as [15] :

J = h(ψγ0 ˜ψ) det(h)−1.

In the calculations above we used the inward ﬂux, not the outward ﬂux,

economically.

Consider now an observer outside the de Sitter universe. In this case we

take the ratio of the outward ﬂux to the total ﬂux,

This is a remarkable result. An observer inside the de Sitter horizon (i.e.,
in region I of Figure 2 in [9]) will detect a positive Hawking temperature,
while an observer outside it (i.e., in region II of Figure 2 in [9]) will detect a
negative Hawking temperature ! It seems that the Hawking temperature is
observer-dependent. In fact this is because our concept of particle is observer-
dependent, as explained below.

We know that the de Sitter universe is unstable and forever expanding
[4]. The inﬂationary era which is believed to have taken place very early in
the evolution of the universe has a similar nature to the de Sitter universe
(the diﬀerence is that inﬂationary era took place for a very short period
of time, not endlessly). The negative temperature above may reﬂect this
instability with respect to an observer outside the de Sitter universe.
If
negative temperature is really an indication that a thermodynamical system
is unstable, then the Cauchy horizons (i.e., inner horizons) in black holes
should be unstable and should not therefore exist (from the point of view of an
observer outside the black hole). Instead of expanding like the cosmological
horizon in the de Sitter case, we ﬁnd that the Cauchy horizons actually tend
to collapse [8].

We also know that inside a black hole there are particle states which
have negative energy with respect to an external stationary observer. As

11

discussed by Gibbons and Hawking [9], a cosmological event horizon has
many similarities with a black hole event horizon. Hence, if we abandon the
concept of particles as being observer-independent and apply this view to our
case, in which we are concerned with the observer inside the event horizon
of a de Sitter universe, then we get the positive ‘Hawking temperature’ as in
the calculations above. See also the discussion in [10] as a comparison.

4 The Unruh Eﬀect

Suppose a detector is being uniformly accelerated in Minkowski spacetime.
According to Unruh [18], this detector behaves as if it were placed in a
thermal bath of ‘real’ particles with temperature (i.e., Unruh temperature)
given by

TU =

a
2πkB

,

(51)

where a is the acceleration of the detector. The ordinary vacuum state in
Minkowski spacetime from the viewpoint of an accelerating observer has
thermal properties similar to those due to true particle creation by a black
hole as seen by a stationary observer at some constant distance from the
black hole. Hence, accelerated systems ﬁnd themselves in a thermal bath.
This is called the Unruh eﬀect. Both Hawking and Unruh temperatures can
be related to information loss, associated with real and accelerated observer
horizons respectively (see, for example, [16, 17, 19, 20]).

In an interesting paper [3], a connection was sought between surface grav-
ity and the Unruh temperature, with the aim of establishing the principle of
equivalence between constant acceleration and ‘true’ gravity eﬀects by glob-
ally embedding curved spaces in higher dimensional ﬂat spaces. The relevant
acceleration in the ﬂat spaces gives the correct Hawking temperature in the
curved ones.

Consider now a constant electric ﬁeld Ec produced by two oppositely
charged plates facing each other. If the electric ﬁeld is strong enough then
the vacuum located between the plates produces real charged particles, as
near to the event horizon of the black hole. Each particle (with mass M and
charge e) propagates with a uniform acceleration given by

a =

eEc
M

.

12

(52)

In the Unruh eﬀect, the propagation of the detector is fully described by a
given classical trajectory; only the internal transitions accompanied by the
emission or absorption of quanta of the radiation ﬁelds are treated quantum-
mechanically. The analysis is in some sense semiclassical, like Hawking’s
treatment of black hole evaporation [12]. However, Unruh used second-
quantised quantum ﬁeld theory. In this paper only ﬁrst-quantised quantum
theory is used.

Unruh found that an accelerated observer in Minkowski spacetime (in
the normal vacuum state) can detect and absorb particles. According to an
inertial observer this absorption appears to be emission from the accelerated
observer’s detector. Similarly, an observer at a constant distance from a
black hole detects a steady ﬂux of particles coming out from the black hole,
with a thermal spectrum, while an observer who falls freely into the black
hole does not see particles radiating. This is a consequence of the principle
of equivalence.

We now discuss the Dirac equation on the Rindler background to study
the Unruh eﬀect [20]. We still employ the minimally coupled Dirac equation
[15, 5], which is in this case

We use the Kerr-Schild gauge

As in the previous section, the fact that s = 0 is always a solution of the
indicial equation implies that analytic solutions always exist at zH , which in
this case acts as an event horizon. (An interesting account of this is given
in Chapter 4 of Birrell and Davies [2].) As before, we wish to investigate
whether the second root can be physically signiﬁcant. We again express ηs

as we found in the standard approach. Thus, the ordinary Minkowskian
vacuum state is seen by an accelerating observer to have thermal properties
very similar to the thermal eﬀects resulting from true particle creation by a
black hole. The temperature (in cgs units) is

TU ≈

×

10−23 a K,

so this eﬀect is too small to be perceived by an ordinary laboratory detector.
In regard to the alternative explanation at the end of the previous section,

if we naively take TU = TH as suggested in [3], then we have

with acceleration

From the discussion above we may conclude that an accelerating observer
Λ
3 in Minkowski spacetime perceives a thermal bath with
Λ
3 /(2πkB), while an inertial observer in the de Sitter universe
temperature
also detects the same temperature. In the former case the acceleration causes
the same eﬀect as that seen by an inertial observer immersed in a thermal
bath with corresponding temperature, while in the latter case the creation
of particles is described as a consequence of cosmic expansion.

5 Conclusion

The derivation of both the correct Fermi-Dirac statistics and the Hawking
temperature may suggest that the method of calculations we employ here -
geometric algebra - is really powerful in dealing with the problems in various
gravitational backgrounds.

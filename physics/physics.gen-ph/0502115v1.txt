Special relativity in terms of Lie groups

Valery P. Dmitriyev
Lomonosov University, P.O. Box 160, Moscow, 117574 Russia

The special theory of relativity is constructed demanding the rectilinear form of a trajectory and

the invariance of the wave equation under linear transformations of space and time coordinates.

1.

INTRODUCTION

The central instrument of the special relativity theory is a pulse of light. The light is usually treated in this theory
merely as a signal with no insight into its physical nature. The only property necessary to be speciﬁed is a peculiar
feature of the speed of delivery of the signal. In the current discourse we construct the theory of relativity taking into
account explicitly that the light is a wave1. The content of the theory becomes the demand that the wave equation
and dynamic equation of mechanics have one and the same symmetry2.

INERTIAL FRAMES OF REFERENCE: CLASSICAL DEFINITION

Axiom. There exists at least one frame of reference x, y, z, t where a free material point describes a rectilinear

trajectory. For simplicity we will consider only a one-dimensional case

where u and x0 are constants. We will ﬁnd other reference frames x′, t′ where this trajectory is rectilinear as well.
These are obviously all frames of reference which can be obtained by linear transformations of the original reference
frame. The translation

where δ and τ are variable parameters. The extension

The linear transform that intermixes the space and time coordinates

The particular type of (6), (7) is given by the Galileo transformation

All frames of reference obtained by such transforms are called inertial frames of reference in the classical sense.
Otherwise we may deﬁne inertial frames of reference as those which do not change the form of the equation

d2x
dt2 = 0
that speciﬁes the family of straight lines (1). The form (10) eliminates transformations (7) with β 6= 0 and restricts
(4), (5) by a dissimilar extension.

INERTIAL FRAMES OF REFERENCE: RELATIVISTIC DEFINITION

We introduce another restriction in the deﬁnition of inertial frames of reference. Consider reference frames obtained

by linear transformations that do not change the equation of the electromagnetic wave

where c is the speed of light. The extension (4), (5) complies this requirement when it is a similarity transformation
for variables x and ct. The transformation (6), (7) does not in general leave invariant Eq. (11). It works only provided
that β = α/c2

and α → 0. We may verify this substituting (12), (13) into Eq. (11) and neglecting α2 terms:

4. LIE GROUPS

We may try to construct a ﬁnite transform by a successive application of inﬁnitezimal steps (12), (13):

= x + αct + βc(t + αx/c) ≈ x + γct,

= t

/c = t + αx/c + β(x + αct)/c ≈ t + γx/c,

Relations (18), (19) and (20) say that this transformation forms a one-parameter Lie group.

In general, a transformation

forms a group with the parameter α if from (21) and

For example, the similarity transformation

t

= t + αt

γ = α + β + αβ.

What a transformation of coordinates belongs to a group speaks of that all reference frames deﬁned by it have

equal rights. In other words, there are no preferred frames of reference in the group.

The group parameter is said to be canonical if it is additive as in (20). When α → 0 the transformation (21) can

be expanded into a Taylor series with the linear part

x

= x + αζ(x, t),

= t + αη(x, t),

where functions ζ(x, t) and η(x, t) are referred to as the kernel of the group. It can be shown (the second Lie theorem)
that the kernel ζ, η of the group having been given we may restore the whole transformation Φ, Ψ resolving the

= x cosh(α + β) + ct sinh(α + β),

= (x cosh α + ct sinh α) sinh β + (x sinh α + ct cosh α) cosh β
= x(cosh α sinh β + sinh α cosh β) + ct(sinh α sinh β + cosh α cosh β)
= x sinh(α + β) + ct cosh(α + β).

6. AN EXTENSION TO DERIVATIVES

We may attach a physical sense to the parameter of the Lorentz group (30). To this end we will construct an

inﬁnitezimal group transformation for the velocity

From (42) we can ﬁnd the diﬀerential equation for the respective group transform

Equation (49) deﬁnes a rectilinear trajectory (1). Eqs. (49) and (11) are invariant under the Lorentz transformation
(30) or (39) extended according to Eqs. (36) and (43). Because of the diﬀerence in symmetries of equations (49) and
(11), extensions are excluded from the consideration. Thus, the class of inertial reference frames is deﬁned by the
Lorentz group, and the space and time translations.

Using (48) we may construct the relativistic form of the second law of classical mechanics

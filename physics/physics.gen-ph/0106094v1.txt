Non Commutativity, Fluctuations and
Uniﬁcation

Abstract

We point out that in the non commutativity and breakdown of
conventional spacetime at micro scales lies the seed to the uniﬁcation
of gravitation and electromagnetism.

1 Introduction

Feynman had speculated that gravitation may be a result of some type of a
ﬂuctuation, motivated by the fact that the attractive Van der Waal force can
be attributed to the dipole moments induced by the ﬂuctuation in molecular
distribution[1, 2]. On the other hand the author had pointed out that in a
ﬂuctuational scheme, not only do we get a key to electromagnetism, but also
we are able to deduce a consistent cosmology in which supposedly accidental
large number relations including the so called Weinberg relation between the
Hubble constant and the pion mass, arise naturally, as a consequence of the
theory[3, 4, 5, 6]. The question is, can gravitation also be included in such
a scheme, and if so can this point to the long sought after uniﬁcation of
gravitation and electromagnetism?
We will now argue that indeed this is so - it is an underlying non commu-
tativity of the spacetime that has kept apart gravitation which relies on a
smooth spacetime manifold on the one hand, and Quantum Theory on the
other hand, though the latter also uses a smooth manifold as an approxima-
tion.
Relatively recent work by scholars like Ord, Nottale, El Naschie, the au-
thor and others, particularly several papers in Chaos, Solitons and Fractals

have highlighted the non smooth and even fractal nature of spacetime[7,
8, 9, 10, 11]. This again can be the key to Einstein’s much sought after
uniﬁcation[12, 13, 14, 15].
An understanding of the underlying substructure of spacetime is required for
such a uniﬁcation program. Indeed Einstein himself had noted in the Journal
of the Franklin Institute,[16]”...it has ben pointed out that the introduction
of a space-time continuum may be considered as contrary to nature in view
of the molecular structure of everything which happens on a small scale. It
is maintained that perhaps the success of the Heisenberg method points to
a purely algebraic method of description of nature that is to the elimination
of continuous functions from physics. Then however, we must also give up,
by principle the space-time continuum. It is not unimaginable that human
ingenuity will some day ﬁnd methods which will make it possible to proceed
along such a path. At present however, such a program looks like an attempt
to breathe in empty space”. Wheeler[17] on the other hand notes, ”the most
evident shortcoming of the geometrodynamic model as is stands is this, that
it fails to supply any completely natural place for spin 1
2 in general and for
the neutrino in particular”, while ”it is impossible to accept any description
of elementary particles that does not have a place for spin half.” Indeed he
describes the four dimensional spacetime as a classical approximation.

2 Non Commutativity and Fluctuations

We are beginning to realize now, and as we will also see in the sequel, that
the problem is that of reconciling the usual classical spacetime with the
spacetime of Quantum Theory, or as Witten puts it[18] Bosonic spacetime
with Fermionic spacetime.
Our starting point is the eﬀect of an inﬁnitessimal parallel displacement on
a vector[19]:

Equation (1) represents the extra eﬀect in displacements, due to the curvature
of space. In terms of partial derivatives with respect to the µth coordinate,
(1) leads to,

δaσ =

∂aσ
∂xµ →

∂xµ −

µνaν

where the Γ’s are the Christoﬀel symbols. We consider the second term on
the right side of (2) as:

λaσ =
where we have utilized the linearity property that in the above formulation

ηµν being the Minkowski metric and hµν a small correction whose square is
neglected.
So from (2) we get,

From (3) we can deduce that

∂
∂xλ →

∂

λv

If we now impose the condition that the right hand side in (4) does not
vanish, then we have a non commutativity of the momentum components in
Quantum Theory. Indeed the left side of (4) can be written as

gµν = ηµν + hµν,

∂
∂xµ →

∂xµ −

l2

where l is the Compton wavelength and ¯h the reduced Planck length wherein
we have utilised the fact that at the extreme scale of the Compton wave-
length, the Planck scale being a special case, the momentum is mc.
We can, in view of (3) identify the right side of (4) as the electromagnetic
Field Tensor

What we have shown here is that once we consider the non commutativity
of the right or left side of (4), then it is meaningful to identify

(3)

(6)

with the electromagnetic four potential, thus leading to a uniﬁcation of elec-
tromagnetism with gravitation theory. This uniﬁcation is not possible in the
usual commutative spacetime, that is when the right or left side of (4) vanish.

Equation (6), as we shall see can be deduced alternatively.
Equation (5) is the manifestation of non commutative geometry: This has
been discussed in detail[15, 20]. The non commutative geometry is given by,
apart from (5), by relations like:

[x, y] = 0(l2)
[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2
x];
(a/¯hc)2p2
[t, pt] = ı¯h[1
t ];

−
[x, py] = [y, px] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpy;
[x, pt] = c2[px,t] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpt; etc.
Interestingly not only can the Dirac equation itself be deduced therefrom,
but as also the existence of the magnetic monopole at extreme Compton
scales can be deduced. Indeed this follows from (5) and the identiﬁcation of
the electromagnetic Field Tensor: We have infact

(7)

which is the celebrated monopole equation. It must be mentioned that such
strong magnetic ﬁelds can be shown to be associated with a non commutative
geometry from an alternative point of view[21].
The relations (5) and (7) are a manifestation of the non point like, spinorial
structure of spacetime. In Quantum SuperString Theory, Witten has called
it Fermionic spacetime, as against the usual commutative geometry of Clas-
sical or Bosonic spacetime[18, 22]. This non commutativity is at the root of
the emergence of electromagnetism and spin as can be seen from (5) or (6)
and subsequent remarks.
Another way of looking at the non commutative relations (5) or (7) is that,
as pointed out by Witten, they provide a correction to the Heisenberg Un-
certainity Principle[23] viz.,

3 Remarks

We observe that the identiﬁcation of (6) with the electromagnetic four poten-
tial,leads to a uniﬁcation of electromagnetism with gravitation theory. This
uniﬁcation is not possible in the usual commutative spacetime, that is when
the right or left side of (4) vanishes.
We now make a number of remarks which corroborate the above deductions.
The identiﬁcation of (6) with the electromagnetic vector potential was de-
duced and discussed at length though from a completely diﬀerent and infact
Quantum Mechanical point of view[14, 3, 25]. There the spinorial or pseudo
vector property of the Dirac four spinor was used, in a purely Quantum Me-
chanical derivation.
This has been discussed at length in the references cited. But brieﬂy, if the

Dirac bispinor is written as

, then at the Compton scale, it is the

 
spinor φ which predominates and moreover, under reﬂection,

This was shown to immediately lead to (3) or (6).
It was pointed out there that interestingly (6) was mathematically similar
to Weyl’s original formulation except that Weyl had introduced it ad hoc,
infact as an external element, without any internal derivation. This was why
Weyl’s formulation was rejected[26, 19]. However as can be seen from the
above, (6) is a consequence of the pseudo spinorial behaviour at the Compton
scale, which again is related to the non commutativity of equation (4) and
manifested in the non commutative geometry contained in equations (5) and
(7).
As string Theorist Greene puts it[27],”...wild electromagnetic ﬁeld oscilla-
tion, weak and strong free ﬁeld ﬂuctuations - quantum mechanical uncertain-
ity tells us the universe is a teeming, chaotic, frenzied arena on microscopic
scales...this frenzy is the obstacle to merging generaal relativity and quantum
mechanics.” Only when we take into account the breakdown of the smooth
spacetime manifold do we begin to make progress.

APPENDIX

In a recent paper El Naschie has introduced the concept of a ﬂuction [11],
a result of geometric ﬂuctuation which could lead towards a uniﬁcation of
fundamental forces. It is pointed out here that recent work by the author
does indeed emphasize the underpinning of ﬂuctuations for fundamental in-
teractions.
In this recent work[25, 3, 28, 15, 29, 30], it was pointed out ﬁrstly that the
ﬂuctuation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (or the Zero Point Field) leads to[17],

It was pointed out that if L

wavelength of a typical elementary particle then from (12) we recover the
mass and energy of this particle. In other words at the Compton wavelength
the elementary particle ”condenses” out of the background Zero Point Field.
Similarly a ﬂuctuation in the metric leads to (Cf.refs.[16, 25]),

10−5gms is a Schwarszchild black hole.

Equation (15) is usually interpreted as an adhoc or empirical relation com-
paring the strengths of gravitational and electromagnetic forces. But once
the ﬂuctuational underpinning has been taken into account, we have deduced
(15) and can now see the connection between electromagnetic and gravita-
tional interactions. Indeed from (15) one can deduce that[32] at the Planck
scale the electromagnetic and gravitational forces become equal, or alterna-
tively the Planck scale of mass
Indeed in the model referred to earlier, elementary particles like electrons
are Kerr-Newman type black holes giving at once both the electromagnetic
and gravitational ﬁelds including the Quantum Mechanical anomalous gyro
magnetic ratio g = 2[14].
From this point, it was shown that the strong interactions follow at the
Compton wavelength scale itself, where the dimensionality is low (Cf.ref.[29,
28, 15]). Infact within the same scheme, it was shown that the very puzzling
characteristics of quarks namely their fractional charge, handedness and con-
ﬁnement besides the order of their massses can be deduced.
It is by the same argument of the ﬂuctuation of the number of particles that
it was shown that the weak interactions can also be explained[30, 33]. In-
deed similar arguments in a diﬀerent context were put forward years ago by
Hayakawa[31].

wavlength L we get from the ﬂuctuation of particle number, this time

whence the weak interaction can be characterised.
The conclusion is that the spirit of ﬂuctions is vindicated (Cf.also ref.[34]).

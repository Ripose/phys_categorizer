Abstract

A thought experiment ﬁrst proposed by Sartori is analysed using the parallel velocity ad-
dition formula of special relativity. The distances and proper-time intervals between some
similarly deﬁned spatial coincidence events are found to be widely diﬀerent in diﬀerent inertial
frames. This relativity of space and time intervals is quite distinct from the well-known time-
dilatation and length contraction eﬀects of special relativity. Sartori’s claimed derivation of the
parallel velocity addition formula, assuming relativistic time dilatation, based on the thought
experiment, is shown to be fallacious.

PACS 03.30.+p

This paper analyses a thought experiment involving two trains T1 and T2, moving
at diﬀerent speeds v and u respectively relative to a ﬁxed platform P, that was orginally
proposed by Sartori [1]. It was claimed that the parallel velocity addition relation (PVAR)
could be derived from the experiment by assuming the existence of the relativistic time
dilatation eﬀect [2]. The derivation will be critically examined below; however, the main
purpose of the present paper is a diﬀerent one. Assuming the PVAR, space and time
intervals between spatial coincidences, in the direction of motion, of P, T1 and T2 are
calculated in their respective rest frames S, S’ and S” and compared.

.

In Fig.1 is shown the experiment as preceived by an observer in the rest frame of P.
At proper time τ 1 = 0 the train T1 is opposite the platform (Event1) and T2 is at a
distance L1 from it (Fig1a). At proper time τ 2, T2 is opposite the platform (Event2)
and T1 is at a distance L2 from it (Fig1b). Finally, since it is assumed that u > v, at
proper time τ 3, T1 and T2 are opposite each other, at a distance L3 from P (Event3).
Figs.2 and 3 show the same sequence of events as observed in the rest frames of T1 and
T2 respectively. The corresponding proper times and distances are τ 1′, τ 2′, τ 3′ L1′, L2′
L3′ in the rest frame of T1 and τ 1′′, τ 2′′, τ 3′′ L1′′, L2′′ L3′′ in the rest frame of T2. In
Fig.2, T2 and in Fig.3, T1 move at the speed w given by the PVAR [2]:

Eliminating w from (3) and (4) by use of (1), Eqns(2)-(4) yield for the proper times and

To ﬁnd the relation between L1, L1′ and L1′′ the reciprocity of measurements by
observers in the diﬀerent frames may be used. The Reciprocity Postulate, as stated by
Pauli, as applied to the present problem is [3]a:

The contraction of lengths at rest in S’’ and observed in S is equal to

that of lengths at rest in S and observed in S’’.

Referring to Fig1a and Fig3a, the ‘length at rest in S” ’is L1′′ while this length, as
observed from S, is L1. Similarly the ‘length at rest in S ’ is L1, and as observed from
S” is L1′′. In this case the length contraction factor, say α, must, from the symmetry
of Fig1a and Fig3a, be an even function of the velocity, u, of T2 relative to P. Pauli’s
postulate then gives the relations:

L1 = α(u)L1′′
L1′′ = α(u)L1

It follows from these equations that

L1 = α(u)L1′′ = α(u)2L1
(13)
so that α(u)2 = 1. Therefore, since both L1 and L1′′ are deﬁned as positive quantities,
L1 = L1′′. A similar comparison of Fig2a and Fig3a, and use of the Reciprocity Postulate
shows that L1′ = L1′′ so that

L1 = L1′ = L1′′

In the Galilean limit, c → ∞, Eqns(5)-(10) then reduce to:

τ 2 = τ 2′ = τ 2′′, L2 = L2′ = L2′′
τ 3 = τ 3′ = τ 3′′, L3 = L3′ = L3′′

In view of (14) the following relations may be derived from (5)-(10):

Also, as can be seen from the ﬁrst equations of (5)-(10), Event2 and Event3 become
simultaneous, in the u = c limit, in the frame S”, but not in S and S’. The relativistic
contraction of L2′ and L2′′ relative to L2, and L3′ and L3′′ relative to L3, is evident on
comparing Fig.1 with Figs.2 and 3, where u = 0.8c, v = 0.4c w = .588c. Note that the
relativity of lengths and times evident in (17) and (18) is quite distinct from the time
dilatation (TD) and length contraction (LC) eﬀects of conventional special relativity. All
times considered here are proper times, so that the Lorentz Transformation (LT) that
relates proper times recorded by stationary clocks to the apparent times of uniformly
moving ones, plays no role, except insofar as the PVAR is a necessary consequence of the
LT [2].

Sartori’s derivation of the PVAR [1], on the basis of the thought experiment just
discussed, is now considered. It is based on the relations, readily derived from Eqns(2)
and (3) above:

τ 3 =

τ 3′ =

u
u − v
w + v
w

τ 2

τ 2′

′

= γτ 2
τ 2
τ 3 = γτ 3′

In order to derive the PVAR from these equations Sartori assumes that the proper times
τ 2 and τ 2′ and τ 3 and τ 3′ are connected by the TD relations [2]:

where γ ≡ p1 − (v/c)2. These equations are clearly inconsistent with (17) and (18)
derived by assuming the PVAR (1) that Sartori is claiming to derive. The argument
given by Sartori to justify (23) is that: ‘Since Event1 and Event2 occur at the same place
in S the interval τ 2 − τ 1’ (in the notation of the present paper)‘is a proper time interval’.
For (24) the argument is: ‘Similarly since Event1 and Event3 occur at the same place in
S’, the interval τ 3′ − τ 1′ is a proper time interval’.

In fact all the times in Sartori’s Eqns(2) and (7) ((21) and (22) above) are proper times.
In fact, in the thought experiment,
This does not however imply Eqns(23) and (24).
nowhere are the apparent times of moving clocks considered, so the TD eﬀect can have
no possible relevance to the analysis of the experiment. The TD eﬀect actually connects
not two proper times as in (23) and(24) but proper times (of stationary clocks) to apparent
times (of uniformly moving clocks). Denoting the latter times by the symbol t, (23) and
(24) should be replaced by:

τ 2′ = γt2, τ 2 = γt2′
τ 3′ = γt3, τ 3 = γt3′

In these equations t is the apparent time of as clock at rest in S as observed from S’ and
t′ is the apparent time of a clock at rest in S’ as observed from S. These observations are
reciprocal in just the same way as the length observations considered in the quotation
from Pauli above. Eqns(25) and (26) express this reciprocity. The absurdity of using the
TD relation between two proper times, as in Sartori’s Eqns(23) and(24), is evident from
(25). Setting t2 = τ 2 in the ﬁrst equation in (25) and t2′ = τ 2 in the second gives:

τ 2′ = γτ 2, τ 2 = γτ 2′

so that

= γτ 2 = γ
(28)
It then follows that γ2 = 1, v = 0, contradicting the initial hypothesis v 6= 0 of the
thought experiment.

which, when solved for w in terms of u and v gives the PVAR (1). The same result is
given by substituting the ratios τ 3/τ 3′ and τ 2′/τ 2 from Sartori’s wrong ans¨atze (23) and
(24). Making the equally (in)valid substitution of proper times for apparent times in
the alternative TD relations of (25) and (26), instead of those chosen by Sartori, gives,
instead of (23) and (24)

Substituting these times in (29) gives, instead of (30) the relation:

which is derived by similar ans¨atze to that used to derive (30), but does not yield the
PVAR. In conclusion, Sartori’s ‘derivation’ of the correct PVAR (1) on the basis on the
incorrect ans¨atze (23) and (24) is fortuitous.

Tunnelling transit time for a frustrated total internal reﬂection (FTIR)

in a double–prism experiment was measured using microwave radiation.

We have found that the transit time is of the same order of magnitude as

the corresponding transit time measured either in an undersized wave-

guide (evanescent modes) or in a photonic lattice. Moreover we have

established that in all such experiments the tunnelling transit time is

approximately equal to the reciprocal (1/f ) of the corresponding fre-

quency of radiation.

Previous photonic tunnelling transit time experiments have been carried out using elec-

tromagnetic radiation both at microwave and optical frequencies. Such experiments were

stimulated by the formal analogy between the classical Helmholtz wave equation and the

quantum–mechanical Schr¨odinger equation. The corresponding tunnelling transit time

data for e.g. electrons are not yet available.

In our Letter we are considering the tunnelling transit time for opaque photonic barriers [1,

2, 3, 4]. We suggest that in general the transit or delay time is approximately equal to

the reciprocal frequency 1/f of the corresponding radiation and that it is independent of

the type or shape of the actual barrier. The transit time or group delay time is deﬁned

dω = x

dω/dk [5]. The tunnelling

transit time or just tunnelling time for short, is measured as the time interval between

2

the respective times of arrival of the signal’s envelope at the two ends of the tunnelling

length x. We are not suggesting here that this is equivalent to the measure of the signal

velocity within the barrier.

In order to justify this hypothesis of a universal tunnelling time we have carefully analyzed

our own experimental results and those of others. Three diﬀerent types of photonic barrier

have been used. Investigations carried out in such experiments as shown in Fig.1.

dielectric layers, c) an undersized waveguide

In Fig.1a the tunnelling eﬀect occurs between two prisms (frustrated total internal re-

ﬂection or FTIR) [6, 7, 8], in Fig.1b tunnelling is modelled by the forbidden band of an

one–dimensional photonic lattice [2, 3, 9], and in Fig.1c tunnelling occurs in the under-

sized section of the waveguide [1]. Since in one dimension the Helmholtz and Schr¨odinger

equations are similar, it is suggested that the three kinds of barrier can be used to model

the one–dimensional process of wave mechanical tunnelling [10, 11].

Let us start by presenting some new data on the double–prism experiment. For n1 > n2

and an angle of incidence θi > θc := arcsin n2/n1 the incoming beam penetrates into the

second medium and travels for some distance along the interface before being scattered

back into the ﬁrst medium (see Fig.2); here n1 and n2 are respectively the refractive

indices of the ﬁrst prism and of the air. If a second prism with n3 = n1 = n is used to

probe the “evanescent” component of the wave, the total reﬂection becomes “frustrated”

and photonic tunnelling across the air gap takes place.

It is indicated in Fig.2 that the barrier traversal time of the double-prism, or what we

call here the tunnelling time can be split into two components ttunnel = tk + t⊥, one along

the surface due to the Goos-H¨anchen shift D, and another part perpendicular to the

surface [12]. The measured tunnelling time represents the group or phase time delay as

explained earlier. The ﬁrst component is related to a non-evanescent wave characterized

by the real wavenumber kk := k0 n sin θi while the second one k⊥ := i k0 qn2 sin2 θi − 1

is related to the evanescent mode traversing the gap between the two prisms. (k0 = 2π/λ0,

λ0 is the corresponding vacuum wavelength, and n the refractive index of both prisms.)

The Goos-H¨anchen shift D is a sensitive function of the gap width d, the frequency of

radiation and its polarization, the beam width and the angle θi of the incoming beam [7,

13, 14]. With increasing air gap the shift reaches a constant asymptotic value D =

dϕ/dkk [7, 13], where ϕ is the phase shift of the reﬂected or transmitted beam.

We have performed a double-prism experiment with two prisms of perspex, obtained from

a 400 mm cube by a diagonal cut. The corresponding refractive index of n = 1.605 gives

a total reﬂection angle of θc = 38.68◦. Microwave radiation at f = 8.45GHz generated

by a 2K25 klystron was fed to a parabolic dish antenna which transmitted a near parallel

beam to the prisms. (Beam spread was less than 2◦).

In order to appoint the tunnelling time we measured the time for a signal travelling the

closed and the opened prism. The transmission time through the opened prism is faster

4

than through the closed prism. Considering the modiﬁcations of the path length the

tunnelling time was determinated from the diﬀerence of both times.

The signal was then picked up by a microwave horn antenna and fed ampliﬁed to an

oscilloscope (HP 54825A). Due to the Goos–H¨anchen shift (see Fig.2) the position of the

beam’s maximum had to be found by scanning the reﬂected and transmitted beams. It

was found that the signal had a Gaussian-like shape, its half-width being 8 ns [17].

Since the total propagation time (antenna–prism–antenna) is longer than the signal half–

width, it is safe to assume that the transmitter, the prism, and the detector are well

decoupled since there is no danger of the circuit components being coupled by a standing

wave building up. The experimental set–up permits asymptotic measurements.

The tunnelling time was measured at the frequency of 8.345 GHz (vacuum wavelength λ0

= 36 mm) using a TE-polarized beam. The beam diameter was 190 mm and the angle of

incidence was chosen to be θi = 45◦.

We tested whether all beam components were parallel and whether the angle of incidence

was within the regime of total reﬂection by measuring at two diﬀerent frequencies the

transmission as a function of the gap between the two prisms. The measured transmission

was 0.73 dB/mm at 8.345 GHz and 0.93 dB/mm for 9.72 GHz respectively compared to the

theoretical values of 0.76 dB/mm and 0.94 dB/mm (see Fig.3). This agreement between

the theoretical (as quoted for k⊥ in [11]) and experimental results indicates that our

method of measuring FTIR is very sensitive, provided the boundary conditions are well

deﬁned.

The tunnelling time was measured in the regime of constant asymptotic Goos–H¨anchen

shift D, where in our case (see experimental parameters given above) D = 31 mm. The

time tGH = tk for the Goos–H¨anchen shift can be obtained from [7] by writing:

tGH ≡ tk =

D n sin(θi)

(1)

For D = 31 mm, n = 1.605 and θi = 45◦ we obtain from (1) tGH = 117 ps. Actually

this value equals the measured Goos–H¨anchen time for the total reﬂected beam in the

absence of the second prism. (The measured time was obtained by properly taking into

consideration the beam’s path in the prism.) As mentioned before for a transmitted beam

the total tunnelling time is the sum of the two components tk and t⊥.

Surprisingly the measured total tunnelling time proved to be equal to tk alone. Since our

accuracy of time measurement was ± 10 ps, this means that t⊥ ≤ 10 ps or at least t⊥ = 0.

Thus it would appear that the measured total tunnelling time depends mostly on the Goos-

H¨anchen shift and hence is approximately equal to the Goos–H¨anchen time tGH. This

result is compatible with some theoretical investigations bearing in mind the imaginary

wavenumber k⊥ of the evanescent mode in the gap [15].

For large gaps where the transit time does not depend on d the theoretical value for the

FTIR-tunnelling time is 82 ps, using the model of Ghatak and Banerjee [16]. This value

is quite near to the measured value of 117 ± 10 ps. It is now quite interesting to note that

the reciprocal of the carrier frequency, 1/f = 120 ps, gives approximately the same value

for the time interval as the measured tunnelling time. This result is also in agreement

with the theoretical model of Ghatak and Banerjee, being valid over a wide range of

frequencies and at all angles of incidence, except in the vicinity of the critical angle θc

and for θi > 80◦ (grazing incidence) (see Fig.4).

This relationship we have obtained for FTIR seems to be a universal property of many

tunnelling processes.

Some previously obtained experimental results are collected in Table I; they all seems

to conﬁrm the suggested universal property that the tunnelling time is approximately

equal to the reciprocal of the carrier frequency. Some deviations may have arisen from

two experimental short comings: the studied barriers have not been suﬃciently opaque

or some tunnelling experiments were too diﬃcult to perform.

Our experimental data obtained from FTIR using microwave radiation show that the ﬁnite

tunnelling time is largely dependent on the interference eﬀects at the entrance boundary

of the barrier. In the case of FTIR it is the time equivalent to the Goos-H¨anchen shift as

was ﬁrst pointed out by Stahlhofen [15].

We have also checked using a waveguide at a microwave frequency of 8.85 GHz, whether

a similar behaviour applies in the case of a photonic lattice type shown in Fig.1b. The

measured group delay time τreﬂ = 75 ± 5 ps of the reﬂected beam was found to be the

same as the time measured for traversing the barrier, τtrans = 74 ± 5 ps, or what we have

called the tunnelling time. Once again there is no indication that the evanescent mode

spend any time inside the barrier, similary to FTIR [17].

Hartman [18] calculated the tunnelling time (phase time delay) of Gaussian wave packets

for one-dimensional barriers based on the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation.

It is

interesting to note that his theoretical wave-mechanical results are also in agreement with

the photonic experiments for diﬀerent barrier lengths [19].

All experimental measurements of the tunnelling time are in agreement with the theoret-

ical calculations and indicate a universal tunnelling time in the case of opaque barriers.

Both the measured ﬁnite total tunnelling time and the time delay of the reﬂected beam

are associated with the front of the barrier and closely correlate with the reciprocal of

frequency of the corresponding radiation.

Abstract

≡

The stongest theoretical support for Schwarzschild Black Holes (SBHs) is the
existence of vacuum Schwarzschild/Hilbert solution. The integration constant α0 in
this solution is interpreted as the mass of the BH. But by equating the 4-volumes (an
invariant) associated with the Schwarzschild metric and the Eddington-Finkelstein
metric[1,2] for a SBH, we directly obtain here the stunning result that SBHs have
0! Thus the Event Horizon (EH) of a SBH (Rg = 2M0 = 0,
the unique mass, M0
G = c = 1) gets merged with the central singularity at R = 0 and, after 90 years,
the mysterious EH indeed gets erased from the non-singular R > 0 region of a com-
pletely empty (R0 = 0) spherical spacetime in accordance with the intuition of the
founders of General Relativity (GR)[3]. Consequently the entropy of SBHs have
the unique value of zero, which instantly removes the quantum mechanical “infor-
mation paradox” and the apparent conﬂict between GR and Quantum Mechanics,
the two pillars of modern physics[4]. And it is time to wonder how this simple
result was missed earlier and how the incorrect idea of (ﬁnite mass) SBHs took over
General Relativity almost 65 years back and then went on misleading Astrophysics,
Theoretical Particle Physics and even Quantum Information Theory! This clean
result ﬁrmly establishes the fact, as far as isolated bodies are concerned, General
Relativity is a singularity free theory even at the classical level! The Black Hole
Candidates with mass M > 0 are thus not BHs and instead could be hot compact
objects whose possibility has so far been overlooked in favour of cold Neutron Stars
or BHs. This result is dedicated to the occurrence of 100 years of Relativity.

Within two years of formulation of General Relativity, Hilbert found the famous spher-
ically symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein equations for a “Massenpunkt”, i.e., a “mass
point”[3]:

where θ and φ are the polar angles and the integration constant α0 is interpreted as twice
the gravitational mass of the “Massenpunkt”: α0 = 2M0 (G = c = 1). Schwarzschild
had found a similar looking solution where the radial variable were r instead of R: R3 =

≥

≥

Schwarzschild and to avoid confusion we too would continue to refer this solution as the
“Schwarzschild” solution (SS). Because of Birchoﬀ’s theorem[2], this vacuum solution
also represents the exterior static spacetime of a spherical body. If M0 is the mass of this
spherical body, its value should depend on the value of R0; i.e, M = M(R0), α = α(R0)
and, for R0

2M, let us again write:

R0 = α0 = 2M0 (2)

Also there could be a case when R0 > α = 2M, and let in this case

ds2 =

R0 > α = 2M (3)

For such a case, the apparent singularity of the metric at R = Rg = 2M would be of
no concern because the vacuum metric would cease to be applicable in the region R < R0.
The original identiﬁcation of α = 2M is done by matching the vacuum solution in

Metric (3) with the corresponding Newtonian solution at large R.

Newtonian gravitation allows for the existence of a spherical “point mass”, i.e, R0 = 0,
and since in Newtonian gravitation, mass is essentially of baryonic or leptonic origin (bare
mass) with no negative “dressing” due to gravity or any self-energy, all masses including
that of a “point” is necessarily ﬁnite, M0 > 0. And, in GR too, it is has so far been
assumed that M0 would continue to be ﬁnite even when the spacetime is completely
empty, i.e, R0 = 0 (mass point). It is this expectation which gave rise to the concept
of Black Holes in the GR era. In the framework of this paradigm, there would be real
physical vacuum spacetime not only for R > 2M0 (metric 3) but also for R
2M0
(Metrics 1 and 2). And thus, in this paradigm, the singularity in metrics (1) and (2)

R (cid:19)

at R = α0 = 2M0 is considered to be a mere coordinate singularity. Two reasons are
often cited for the foregoing assertion [1,2]:

(a) GR requires that, in any truly non-singular region, the determinant g of the metric
coeﬃcients must be negative in any coordinate system in order that its sign matches with
the corresponding negative sign of gM in a free falling Minkowskian spacetime:

where J is the Jacobian of the relevant coordinate transformation. Since, in spherical
polar coordinates, gM =

R4 sin2 θ, we obtain

g = J 2gM

−

g =

J 2R4 sin2 θ

−

Thus, at an arbitrary θ, g can vanish only at R = 0 unless J = 0 at some ﬁnite R, a situ-
ation, highly unlikely, both, physically and mathematically. Nonetheless, our conclusion
will not be based on the probable vanishing of g at some region of spacetime.

For the diagonal metrics (1) and (2), one has

Thus J1 = 1 despite the “coordinate singularity” and at R = α0,

appears to be negative under the assumption α0 = 2M0 > 0.

and which does vanish at α0 = ρ/4, i.e, at R = α0 (see Eq.[11]). This vanishing of
g2 at R = α0 = 2M should immediately lead to an introspection about the true nature
of the “coordinate singularity”. To this eﬀect, recall the obvious fact that the variable R
has only two extrema; one at R =
and another at R = 0 and correspondingly we must
have dR = 0 only at R =

and R = 0. But from Eq.(11), it follows that

ρ = +α0/4, i.e, at R = α0. Hence R has a minimum at R = α0 where g2 = 0! Therefore,
R = α0 and R = 0 must correspond to same spacetime where R has its only minimum.
And this is possible only when α0 = 0.

Note that in case R0 > α0, Eqs.(11-14) will cease to be valid for R

α0 and we would
not obtain the result g2 = dR = 0 at R = α0. These results are obtained only when we
consider R0

α0. And for the BH, R0 = 0.

Now consider the shape of the metric for R = α0, i.e, at ρ = α0/4 (Eq.[11]):

Thus, in no case, the metric is timelike at R = α0 which deﬁnitely means that R = α0 is

manifold. In the passing, note that the dererminant g3 associated with the metric (16)

To ensure that all the readers are fully convinced about the resolution of this 90 year
old mystery, we ﬁnally recall the Eddington-Finkelstein metric[1,2] which was designed
exclusively for SCHs, i.e, for R0 = 0, M = M0, and α = α0:

Thus, in a most direct manner, we obtain the stunning result that the mass of the

Prosaically, this means that, the gravitational mass of a “mass point” (R0 = 0) is actually

0 which, however, following the Newtonian hangover has so far been assumed to be
≡
ﬁnite!

Then the EH merges with the central singularity at R = 0 and hence the metric (1)
has only one singularity, the singularity at R = α = α0 = 0. Note that even when
α = 2M = 0, K EH = K(R = 0) =
implying that this is a curvature singularity. It
may be also recalled that in GR, unlike in Newtonian gravitation, occurrence of M = 0
does not necessarily mean absence of matter. A zero total energy occurs whenever all
sources of positive energy like baryonic or leptonic mass energy and internal energy get
exactly balanced by negative self-gravitational or any other self energy. Now let us brieﬂy
recapitulate the series of wrong notions which led to the greatlt incorrect idea of ﬁnite
mass SBHs:

∞

1. The integration constant α0 appearing in the Hilbert (now known as Schwarzschild)
solution was erroneously considered to be positive deﬁnite (α0 > 0) when attempt should
have been made to ﬁx it with suitable physical condition(s), as is the norm for ﬁxing
integration constants.

2. Even assuming that α0 > 0, one could have attempted to ﬁnd out the 3-speed
1 in any
1 in all

(v) of a test particle at R = α0 and R < α0 and by realizing that once v
coordinate system, rule of relativistic addition of velocities must ensure that v
other coordinate system.

→

→

3. The fact that the acceleration and more importantly, physically measureable Ac-
celetation SCALAR, a, blows up at R = α0[3, 5] was always ignored. Attention was
focussed only on the geometrical scalars such as Kretschmann scalar without realizing
that at a mere coordinate singularity none of the Physical Scalars would vanish. On the
other hand, the value of α0, an integration constant, should have been ﬁxed by taking
help of physical quantities, such as a.

4. Chandrasekhar’s discovery of an upper mass limit for White Dwarfs only gave the
upper mass limit of cold static objects and all it meant is that collapse can proceed
beyond the cold White Dwarf stage. But this was interpreted as existence of SBHs as the
immediate next step.

5. Similarly in context of the existence of the Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ limit[6], which
4M⊙, it was ignored that this limit corresponds to
at present, is considered to be
cold and strictly static baryonic objects. The possibility of likely existence of Einstein
collapse solutions for hot (i.e, objects primarily supported by trapped radiation pressure)
and quasistatic objects (which would generate pressure gradient even without any nuclear
fuel) was never considered.

6. We recall that there is only one exact analytical solution of spherical gravitational

collapses to a SBH in a proper time[7]

Since the dust ball is at rest at t = 0, we can use the equation for hyrdo-static balance[6]

0, we have dp/dR

Since for a dust p
0, and then the foregoing Eq. yields ρi = 0.
From thermodynamical point of view too, whether at rest or not, a p = 0 equation of
state is physically obtained only if ρ = 0. Therefore, trivially, the mass of the dust ball is
zero for a ﬁnite Ri. Hence the mass of the resultant SBH is indeed M = 0. But this was
always ignored, it was pretended that eventhough, p = 0, we must have ρ = f inite and
M too would be ﬁnite in tune with the idea that the integration constant α0 > 0 (when
it was actually zero).

And when M = 0, from Eq.(29), it follows that, τc =

. Thus though the M = 0
SBHs are, mathematically, allowed by GR, they cannot be realized in an universe with
ﬁnite proper age.

∞

Since there is no EH in a ﬁnite proper time, there is no trapping or loss of quantum
information either and hence there is no question of any conﬂict between GR and quantum
mechanics[4].

→

In some diﬀerent papers, it was shown that even for the most general case of spherical
collapse (i.e, not necessarily for uniform dust), no trapped surface is ever formed[8,9,10].
Thus a collapsing ﬂuid must always radiate and if it would be assumed to undergo con-
tinued collapse M
0 asymptotically. This is the reason that the integration con-
stant α0 = 2M0 turned out be identically zero. Hence the observed BH candidates with
masses often much higher than the upper mass limit of cold baryonic bodies in hydro-
static equilibrium, cannot be SCBs. Detailed analysis of recent observational data indeed
suggests that the BH candidates have strong intrinsic magnetic moments rather than
any EH[11,12,13,14]. And it has been suggested that the BH candidates are Magnetized
Eternally Collapsing Objects (MECOs). These are extremely hot objects in quasistatic
equilibrium due to extremely strong radiation and magnetic pressure[10,11,12,13]. How-
ever, if Quantum Gravity would be invoked, the supposed Black Holes could be cold and
static conﬁgurations with hard surfaces[14].

Much investigations would be required to be certain about the precise nature of the
observed BH candidates. In any case, since the BH paradigm was built on the assumption
α0 > 0, and now that it is found that, actually, α0 = 0, this paradigm collapses immedi-
ately irrespective of the fact that, at this moment, most of the authors would close their
eyes to ignore this stunning result. With α0 = 0, the Schwarzschild, Hilbert and related
solutions become identical and the physical confusion arising from mathematical gauge
freedom vanishes for the vacuum case.

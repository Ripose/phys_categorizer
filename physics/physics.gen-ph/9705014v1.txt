ABSTRACT

Can the Past be restored? Poincar´e and Costa de Beauregard showed that the past
is not restored statistically. This follows from Bayes formula. It is mith that history
can make this and moreover that history is created for this. Historian is sure that he is
free for such work. In this mithological world one are living not only historians but all
people. The fear of death is a cause of such conﬁdence. In this note three Principles of
Time will be formulated which say that historians can not give us the truth text-book
of History of any society.

Can a reseacher restore the events of the past epoches without distortion? It
is mith that history can make this and moreover that history is created for this.
In this mithological world one
Historian is sure that he is free for such work.
are living not only historians but all people. The fear of death is a cause of such
conﬁdence. In this note three Principles of Time will be formulated which say
that historians can not give us the truth text-book of History of any society.

1 Bayes Principle

In the book [1], Costa de Beauregard formulates the following

Bayes Principle. Restortion of the Past can be made only in the case when
if some knowledge about the Past is

the a priori’s probabilities are known, i.e.
assumed the knowledge of the Present can only specify one.

In other words, although the Future is statistically predicted the Past is not
statistically restored. In [1], Costa de Beauregard gives very instructive example
which belongs to Poincar´e.

The a priori’s probabilities are determinated on the basis historical documents,
therefore there exists the hope that in future the document will be found which
will ascertain the truth. But this hope is vain as it follows from the third Principle
of time (see §3).

2 Principle of the uncertainty of description

This principle has the following form

∆D∆t ≥ c1

(1)

where ∆D is historical uncertainty, i.e. the number of contradictory details in
description of historical event which occured for time ∆t, and c1 > 0 is some
constant.

In other words, the less time of life of investigated historical event the more

contradictory details.

But it is known that many crimes are successfully investigated. Does it mean
that second Principle is false? No. There exists the concept ”time of prescrip-
tion”. It is required the Third Principle of Time (see §3).

3 Principle of the interaction of epoches

Principle of the uncertainty of historical description acts only under condition of
realization another Principle which is called the

Principle of the interaction of epoches and which asserts that historical uncer-
tainty ∆D is more when the investigated epoch lies farther from present epoch:

∆D ≤ c2∆τ,

(2)

2

where ∆τ is time interval between present and investigated epoches, c2 > 0
is some constant.
In other words, the more antique epoch the less chance to
ascertain the truth.

The formula (2) is similar to the Shenon Principle which asserts that precision
of information (from one system to diﬀerent one) which can be transfered and
received is proportional to the time that runs out

It follows from (1) and (2) that

∆I ≤ k∆τ.

∆τ ∆t ≥ c1c−1
2

or

∆t ≥ c1c−1
2

∆τ

→ 0 under ∆τ → ∞

(3)

It means that for restortion of the events which belong to time interval ∆t of
interesting for us epoch must not be too near to the present one. The constants c1
and c2 are determinated from (1)-(3). They must have such values to be possible
the investigations of crimes of the recent past. For example, it must exist the
possibility to restore uniquely all events, i.e. ∆D = 0 if a crime was done 1 hour
ago, ∆τ = 60 min. In other words, c1 ≤ 1 [min−1], and c2 ≤ 1/60 [min−1]. One
can take c1 = 1 [min−1], and c2 = 1/60 [min−1].

We see that the problem of determination of constants c1 and c2 is not easy.
One can suppose that interaction of epoches has more composite oscillating

character with increasing amplitude

∆D ≤ c2∆τ f (∆τ ) cos

2π∆τ

(cid:18)

T (cid:19)

,

(4)

where T is period and f (∆τ ) ≥ 0 is non-decreasing function. The negative value
of right side of (4) on segment ∆τ ∈ [T /4 + nT, 3T /4 + nT ] must be interpreted
as epoches for which one-valued restortion of events is possible.

Uncertainty of historical description insreases for epoches ∆τ = nT when we

deepen in the Past.

Principle (4) is held for the resilient space-time V 4, i.e. V 4 when is a resilient
leaf of some foliation F in ﬁve-dimensional space. The resilient space-time winds
round itself. A movement along 5-th coordinate gives the inﬁnite piercing of
space-time V 4 at the points of Past and Future [2, 3, 4, 5]. The past epoches winds
round present epoch and become nearer and nearer as this see the observer living
in ﬁve-dimensional world. The (almost) oscillation follows from this. Let that

3

the coming has value of the Plank’s length L ∼ 10−33cm for past epoches ∆τ =
nT, n > n0. Then natural ﬂuctuations of 5-metric (electro-gravity-scalar ﬁeld)
will make foam topology of four-dimensional space-time. Hence the present epoch
will connect with the past epoches ∆τ = nT, n > n0 by means of four-dimensional
wormholes. Hence the events of present and past are not diﬀered under quantum
point of view. The Past is mixed with the Present. Such intermixing of Past with
Present must have some projection on the events of macro-world. It follows from
[2, 3] where it is shown that four-dimensional macro-wormholes connecting Past
and Present can appear under perturbations of scalar ﬁelds.

Maybe oscillating character of intermixing of Past with Present was exposed

in the statistical investigations of historical events by A.T.Fomenko [?].

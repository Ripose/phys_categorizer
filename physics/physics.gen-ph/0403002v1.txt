General-Relativistic Equations of Motion in terms of
Energy and Angular Momentum

Yong Gwan Yi

February 2, 2008

Abstract

An attempt is made to describe the general-relativistic equations of motion for
the Schwarzschild geometry in terms of the classical concepts of energy and angular
momentum. Using the customary terms the geodesic equations can be viewed in
a way that is very helpful in providing the physical meaning of the mathematical
development.

The general theory of relativity has led to a completely new picture of gravitational
phenomena in geometrical terms. The gravitational ﬁeld is represented by metric ten-
sor, and the equations of free fall are geodesics. Although the geodesic equation gives
a constant of motion corresponding to energy, accordingly, most textbooks introduce
approaches that exclude serious use of energy concept [1]. However, it would seem de-
sirable to use the relativistic energy in describing the central force problem. For many
applications, the equation of motion containing the energy and angular momentum
is the natural one. In order to discuss the comparison with Newton’s theory or the
transition to quantum theory, it is important that the description of the motion be in
terms of its energy and angular momentum. In a certain sense, the use of relativistic
energy is considered necessary and important.

Let us see what can be learned from Einstein’s theory of gravitation. In this paper,
we deﬁne aµbµ as a0b0 − a · b. We begin by pointing out that the metric of our space-
time is ds2 = gµν dxµdxν. The Schwarzschild expression for the metric around a mass
M is

c2dτ 2 = c2g00dt2 − grrdr2 − r2dθ2 − r2 sin2 θdψ2
(1)
with g00 = 1/grr = 1 − 2GM/c2r. We consider the central force motion in the plane
ψ = π/2. The square of velocities will then be

c2 → c2g00

and v2 → grr(cid:18)

to a ﬁrst approximation. This form of equation reduces to the familiar equation leading
to the Lorentz time dilation in the limit as g00 approaches to unity. In this sense one
may see the relation in (3) as the Schwarzschild time dilation.

The equations of motion in the Schwarzschild ﬁeld yield two constants of motion.

One of them is given by

g00

= constant,

dt
dτ

which corresponds to the energy of the system. The other constant is obtained from
r2(dθ/dτ ) = constant, and is absorbed immediately into the deﬁnition of the angular
momentum l. It would seem at ﬁrst sight that the constant in (4) is of no importance
in the geometrical approach. However, the constant has an important physical signiﬁ-
cance, for it can lead to the formulation of the resulting relativistic mechanics in terms
of the energy of a particle as in the case of special relativity. The relativistic equations
of motion must be such that in the nonrelativistic limit they go over into the customary
forms given by Newton’s theory. Thus the task of identifying the constant is greatly
facilitated by seeking the form which it would have in the nonrelativistic limit. In the
nonrelativistic limit, Eq. (4) can be expanded as

g00

≃ 1

where m is the mass of a particle. By comparison with Newton’s theory, we can identify
the constant with

Consequently it yields the expression

g00

=

mc2 (mc2 + E).

E = mc2g00

− mc2

for the energy of a particle in the static isotropic gravitational ﬁeld.

The geodesic equations teach us a four-velocity of the form gµµdxµ/dτ .

In the
Schwarzschild metric the scalar product of two four-vectors is deﬁned as gµν aµbν or
gµν aµbν. With this deﬁnition the square of the magnitude of the velocity four-vector
is a constant, c2. From the covariant form of velocity we can write the relativistic
expression for momentum as

pr = mgrr

dr
dτ

and pθ = mr2 dθ
dτ

≡ l.

This is a deﬁnition of momentum which is deduced from the constants of motion in the
Schwarzschild metric ﬁeld. Equations (7) and (8) are the necessary relativistic gener-
alizations for the energy and momentum of a particle, consistent with the conservation
laws and the postulates of general relativity.

As in the special theory of relativity,

it is natural to attempt to identify the
four equations of energy and momentum conservation as relations among the energy-
momentum four-vectors. In special relativity, the connection between the kinetic energy

T and the momentum is expressed in the statement that the magnitude of the momen-
tum four-vector is constant:

pµpµ =

− p2 = m2c2.

T 2
c2

This must be generalized to provide an expression satisfying the general-relativity for-
mulation. We observe that the momentum in (8) is proportional to the space com-
ponents of the four-vector velocity. The time component of the four-vector velocity is
cg00dt/dτ . Comparison with (7) shows that the energy of a particle diﬀers from its
time component by the rest energy mc2. We are thus led to

as the covariant form of the total energy, for then pr, l, and E/c form a four-vector
momentum. The desired generalization of energy-momentum equation must be

E = mc2g00

dt
dτ

gµµpµpµ =

r2 = m2c2.

It should be noted that the gravitational potential lends itself to incorporation in the
metric of space-time geometrization, so the potential energy is absorbed automatically
into the path length of a particle and its motion therein. In general relativity, therefore,
kinetic energy and potential energy individually become meaningless; only the total
energy of a particle is signiﬁcant.

We can now proceed to the relativistic equation for the orbit of a planet. We can still
talk in terms of the system energy and the system angular momentum. For comparison
with Newton’s theory, it is preferable to deﬁne the energy E as in (7), which would
bring E in line with the nonrelativistic value. The Schwarzschild metric in (1) can now
be expressed in terms of two constants of motion E and l as

(mc2 + E)2
c2g00

− m2grr(cid:18)

r2 = m2c2.

This form of the equation of motion can also be obtained from a combination of the
diﬀerential equations of geodesics [2]. Most often we are more interested in the shape of
orbits, that is, in r as a function of θ, than in their time history. The angular momentum
relation can then be used directly to convert (12) into the diﬀerential equation for the
orbit; this gives

r2 =
The solution may thus be determined by a quadrature:

The expressions for the energy and angular momentum appear here in somewhat dif-
ferent forms involving the metric tensors g00(r±), but their equivalence in the limit as
g00 → 1 with the respective nonrelativistic Newtonian relations are shown by expanding
the equations to a ﬁrst approximation:

We can obtain the same result much more simply.

It is both easier and more
instructive to expand g00 in the formal solution (14). It preserves the advantage that
the orbit equation is evaluated in terms of the energy and the angular momentum of
the system. Note that we have to expand to second order in GM/c2r. The angle swept

that we need g00 to second order in GM/c2r to calculate △θ to ﬁrst order. To put
this another way, the high accuracy of the orbit precession serves as a touchstone for
the possible forms of g00 by requiring the degree of agreement to second order. The
procedure described here is particularly simple and is suﬃcient to enable one to conﬁrm
the fact.

and θ0 is a constant of integration.
In addition to the motion of a planet’s peri-
helion of 2π(3G2M 2m2/c2l2) per revolution, the relativity eﬀect produces the term
(GM/c2r2)(dr/dθ) in the angle swept out by the radius vector of the planet. This term
is not a new result but merely a result of rewriting the square root in the integrand
which the integration of (20) actually yields, using (14) to a ﬁrst approximation. It
is evident therefore that the relativity eﬀect in planetary motion obeying (19) or (20)
is to cause not only the precession of the perihelion of the orbit of a planet but also
the change in the angular displacement of the planet due to its radial velocity. The
additional change appearing in the angular displacement of the planet, which does not
appear in a circular orbit, might be an eﬀect due to the ﬁnite velocity of propagation
of the solar gravitational ﬁeld.

The formulation presented in this paper is mathematically equivalent to the familiar
formulations. There are therefore no fundamentally new results. However, the point
of view which has been taken here regarding the central force problem diﬀers from
the usual point of view. There is a certain lack of energy concept in the geometrical
approach to the subject. A prominent feature of the present formulation is that the
customary concepts of classical mechanics are emphasized throughout within the math-
ematical framework required by general relativity. This is very helpful for grasping the
physical meaning behind the mathematical development. The present point of view
oﬀers a distinct advantage.

In the article, on the basis of the author’s model of formation of the observable physical
space R3 in the process of dynamics of special discrete one-dimensional vectorial objects,
byuons, while minimizing their potential energy of interaction in the one-dimensional
space R1 formed by them, and based on the Weyl’s geometrical model of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld, the nature of this ﬁeld consisting in a suitable variation of byuon interaction
periods in the space R1 , is shown.

1. Introduction

A wealth of works, beginning from antiquity (Aristoteles1, ”The Principia” by
Euclides, Democritus) and ending with authors of 20th century, are dedicated to the
structure of space and time, to the physical sense of these fundamental concepts,
and their properties. For brevity sake, we will not give an extensive bibliography
on the subject but advise the reader to acquaint himself only with two monographs
2,3, in the ﬁrst of which a physical and philosophical comprehension of hundreds
of works on this problem is presented, and in the second, an ingenious work of a
known russian physicist D.I.Blokhintsev, diﬃculties encountered in describing the
world of elementary particles when creating a modern space theory, are shown. In
all existing works on quantum ﬁeld theory and physics of elementary particles, the
space in which elementary processes occur, as a rule, is given one way or another.
Further the action S1 is written in the given space in terms of the Lagrangian
function density for the ﬁelds and objects considered, and equations of motion
are obtained for the system considered in the given space from the least action
principle. Yet we will follow another way and try to build physical space and

major properties of elementary objects in this space from dynamics of a ﬁnite set of
special discrete objects (so called byuons) 4,5. Note that the development of physical
comprehension of elementary processes on the base of modern superstring models
6−9, unfortunately, also gives no evidences for how structured is the observed space
itself which is obtained, according to one of the models, by means of compactiﬁcation
of six dimensions in a ten-dimensional space. New theoretical approaches found in
construction of physical space have given the chance to look in a new way also at
the most studied object of the classic and quantum ﬁeld theory, the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. In the present paper we will not touch upon many problems widely covered in
the literature and concerned with the photon and electromagnetic ﬁeld: whether the
photon has a rest mass (Proc’s equation), whether or not it possesses a longitudinal
component of ﬁeld, being artiﬁcially removed by the Lorentz’s condition 10, etc.
We try only to explain the origin of the Maxwell’s equations as a peculiar change
in the structure of physical space due to dynamics of byuons. Chronologically, the
author has arrived to the theory of byuons when investigating a system of spinor
and boson ﬁelds interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld 11−15.As a generalized
coordinate in this system, the velocity of propagation of interactions c = c(x, t) was
taken where x is the coordinate of a certain one-dimensional compact space M1, t is
time, and the electric charge e of the ﬁelds is assumed to be some implicit function
of c(x, t), i.e. e = e[c(x, t)]. Thus the author anticipated the local violation of gauge
invariance and Lorentz’s group extended on translation (Poincaret’s group) in order
to gain an insight into the process of physical space formation.

2. Fundamental Theoretical Concepts of Physical Space Origin.

In Ref. 4,5, the conception of formation of the observed physical space R3 from
a ﬁnite set of byuons is given. The byuons Φ(i) are one-dimensional vectors and
have the form:

Φ(i) = Agx(i),

where x(i) is the ”length” of the byuon, a real (positive, or negative) value depending
on the index i = 0, 1, 2, ..., k..., a quantum number of Φ(i); under x(i) a certain
time charge of the byuon may be meant (with x(i) in centimeters). The vector
Ag represents the cosmological vectorial potential, a new basic vectorial constant
4,5,14,15. It takes only two values:

Ag =

Ag

1Ag (cid:27)

where Ag is the modulus of the cosmological vectorial potential (Ag ≈
×
CGSE units). According to the theory 4,5, the value Ag is the limiting one.

potential, i.e. the vectorial potential ﬁelds from the Sun (A⊙ ≈
1011 CGSE units), and the Metagalaxy (> 1011 CGSE units) are

superimposed on the constant Ag resulting probably in some turning of AΣ relative
to the vector Ag in the space R3 and in a decrease of it.

∼

Hence in the theory of physical space (vacuum) which the present article leans
upon, the ﬁeld of the vectorial potential introduced even by Maxwell gains a fun-
damental character. As is known, this ﬁeld was believed as an abstraction. All
the existing theories are usually gauge invariant. For example, in classical and
quantum electrodynamics, the vectorial potential is deﬁned with an accuracy of an
arbitrary function gradient, and the scalar one is with that of time derivative of the
same function, and one takes only the ﬁelds of derivatives of these potentials, i. e.
magnetic ﬂux density and electric ﬁeld strength, as real.

ln Refs.11−15,local violation of the gauge invariance and Poincaret’s group was
supposed, and the elementary particle charge and quantum number formation pro-
cesses were investigated in some set, therefore the potentials gained an unambiguous
physical meaning there. In the present paper, this is a ﬁnite set of byuons.

The works by D.Bohm and Ya.Aharonov 16 discussing the special meaning of
potentials in quantum mechanics are the most close to the approach under consid-
eration, they are conﬁrmed by numerous experiments 17.

For understanding the byuon dynamics, present an extract from the author’s

Let us assume that the velocity c in the space MI (x, t) is a function of x and t,

i.e. c = c(x, t). Then the metrics of such a manifold may be represented as

The function c(x, t) satisﬁes (5) and at a ﬁxed x0 has the form shown in Fig. 1. As
is seen, c(x, t) has discontinuities at t = t∗ and t = 0. Since a signal from point x1
to point x2 in MI cannot be transmitted instantaneously (with the inﬁnite speed),
c0 can be realized in nature. One

It is known from Ref. 18 that if restrictions are imposed on a variable function
minimizing a functional (in our case, c(x, t) may be thought of as imposed on by

viewpoint of minimum functional, only boundary values of the function being varied

In Refs. 4,5, the following hypothesis has been put forward:

It is suggested that the space R3 observed is built up as a result of minimizing the
potential energy of byuon interactions in the one-dimensional space R1 formed by
them. More precisely, the space R3 is ﬁxed by us as a result of dynamics arisen of
byuons. The dynamic processes and, as a consequence, wave properties of elemen-
tary particles appear therewith in the space R3 for objects with the residual positive
potential energy of byuon interaction (objects observed).

Let us brieﬂy list the results obtained earlier when investigating the present

model of physical vacuum (see Appendix):

1. The existence of a new long-range interaction in nature, arising when acting
on physical vacuum by the vectorial potential of high-current systems, has been
predicted 19,20.

2. All the existing interactions (strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational
ones) along with the new interaction predicted have been qualitatively explained in
the uniﬁed context of changing in three periods of byuon interactions with character-
1028cm,
10−13cm, and ˜x0kN P

determined from the minimum potential energy of byuon interaction 4,5.
3. Masses of leptons, basic barions and mesons have been found 14,15.
4. The constants of weak interaction (vectorial and axial ones) and of strong

interaction have been calculated 14,15.

5. The origin of the galactic and intergalactic magnetic ﬁelds has been explained

process of R3 from the one-dimensional space of byuons 4,5.

6. The matter density observed in the Universe (

7. The origin of the relic radiation has been explained on the basis of uniﬁed
mechanism of the space R3 formation from one-dimensional space R1 of byuons 4,5,
etc.

Let us explain item 1 brieﬂy. It is shown in Ref. 15 that masses of all elementary
particles are proportional to the modulus of Ag (see Appendix). If now we direct
the vectorial potential of a magnetic system in some space region towards the vector
Ag then any material body will be forced out of the region where

The new force is nonlocal, nonlinear, and represented by a complex series in ∆A,
a diﬀerence in changes of
due to the potential of a current at location points
of a sensor and a test body 5,20. This force is directed mainly by the direction of
the vector Ag, but as the latest experiments have shown, there is also an isotropic
component of the new force in natures, which component acts omnidirectionally

One of the important predictions of the theory is revealing a new information
channel in the Universe which is associated with the existence of a minimum object
with positive potential energy, so called object 4b, arising in the minimum four-
contact interaction of byuons in the vacuum states II +, I +, II −, I −. In four-contact
byuon interaction, a minimum action equal to h (Planck’s constant) occurs, and
the spin of the object appears. Hence the greater part of the potential energy of
byuon interaction is transformed into spin of the object 4b. The residual (after
33eV . It is identiﬁed
minimization) potential energy of the object 4b is equal to
with the rest mass of this object in the space R1. In agreement with Refs. 4,5, the
indicated minimum object 4b has, according to Heisenberg uncertainty relation, the
1028cm in R3. The total energy of these objects
uncertainty in coordinate ∆x
determines near 98% energy of the Universe as well as its matter density observed.
In Refs. 4,5 it is shown that the existence of the 4b-objects interpreted by the author

3. On The Nature Of The Electromagnetic Field.

Within the limits of an article it is diﬃcult to unravel the problem as a whole,
i.e. to develop a physical and mathematical model of the phenomenon. Therefore

we dwell basically on a new physical model of the electromagnetic ﬁeld resulting
from the above presented model of physical space. But, as is known, the new is
very often contained in the forgotten old if that is looked at in a new way.

Consider the Weyl’s geometrical model of the electromagnetic ﬁeld 21. His-
torically, the Weyl’s geometry was proposed for explaining by curvature of space
not only the long-range gravitational ﬁeld as in the theory of Einstein but another
long-range ﬁeld, the electromagnetic ﬁeld, too.

Gravity is well explained by the Einstein’s theory in terms of space curvature.
This suggests that the electromagnetic ﬁeld also can be attributed to a certain space
property instead of considering this ﬁeld as simply ”immersed” in space. Thus, some
more general space than the Riemannean space underlying the Einstein’s theory, had
to be proposed to describe the existence of either gravitational or electromagnetic
forces and to unify the long-range interactions.

The curvature of space required by the Einstein’s theory can be represented in
terms of parallel displacement of a vector moving along a closed contour, which leads
to the eﬀect that the ﬁnal direction of the vector will not be the same as the former.
The Weyl’s generalization was in assuming that the ﬁnal vector has not only a
diﬀerent direction but a diﬀerent length, too (and this is the most important thing).
In the Weyl’s geometry, there is no absolute procedure of comparing elements of
length at two diﬀerent points if these are not inﬁnitely close to each other.

The comparison may be made only relative to a line segment connecting the two
points, and diﬀerent ways will give diﬀerent results as to ratio of the two elements
of length.
In order to have mathematical theory of lengths one must arbitrarily
establish a length standard at each point and then relate any length at anyone
point to the local standard for this point. Then we will have a ﬁxed value of the
vector length at any point but this value varies with the local standard of length.
Let’s consider a vector of length l positioned at a point with coordinates xµ(µ =
1, 2, 3, 4). Assume that this vector is transferred to the point xµ + δxµ. The change
in its length δl will be proportional to l and δxµ so that δl = lkµδxµ where kµ
is additional parameters of the ﬁeld appearing in the theory together with the
Einsteinean gµν and being equally fundamental.

Assume that the length standards have been changed so that lengths are multi-

plied by a coeﬃcient λ(x). Then l goes into l′ = lλ(x) and l + δl does into

l′ + δl′ = (l + δl)λ(x + δx) = (l + δl)λ(x) + l

∂λ
∂xµ δxµ.

Hence

Thus, δl′ = l′k′

µδxµ where

δl′ = λδl + l

∂xµ δxµ = λl(kµ +

∂ lg λ
∂xµ )δxµ.

k′
µ = kµ +

(12)

8 Yu. Baurov

If our vector is transferred by parallel displacement along a closed contour, a change
in its length will be δl = lΩµνδSµν where

Ωµν =

∂kµ
∂xν −

∂kν
∂xν ,

and δSµν notes an element of area limited by a small contour.

Let us show that the new ﬁeld characteristic kµ appearing in the Weyl’s theory
have the meaning of electromagnetic potentials. As is known 10,22, the antisymmet-
∂νAµ where
ric tensor Fµν of the electromagnetic ﬁeld has the form Fµν = ∂µAν −
Aµ and Aν are components of the real covariant four-vectorial electromagnetic po-
tential Aα(α = 0, 1, 2, 3). Comparing the Ωµν and Fµν tensors we see that, indeed,
the additional parameters characterizing proportionality of change in length of the
vector l while going from the point xµ to the point xµ + δxµ, have the meaning
of electromagnetic potentials. They go through the transformations (12) corre-
sponding not to a change in geometry but only to a change in choosing artiﬁcial
length standards. The derivatives Ωµν have a geometrical meaning without regard
to standards of length and correspond to physically signiﬁcant parameters, electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. Thus, the geometry of Weyl assures just what is necessary for
describing the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds in terms of geometry.

Hence when assuming a mathematical algorithm of transition of events from
R1 to R3 as having been found, the electromagnetic and gravitational interaction
of objects can be assured by changing period of byuon interactions k, N and scale
lengths x0 and ct∗, respectively. The electromagnetic ﬁeld is caused therewith by
changing
due to some scalar A0, and magnetic ﬁeld is due to a vectorial
potential A but with the complete return of the vector A to the initial point of
the R3 - space while tracing some closed contour l (i.e.
in the absence of spacial
anisotropy). Note once more that the electromagnetic constant of interaction (ﬁne
structure constant) e2/hc0 will be constant in all reference systems (see Appendix).

AΣ

|

Let’s now answer the question ”At the cost of which VSs of byuons is the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld (i.e. variation of l at the cost of x0 and ct∗ variations) described
?” There can be two such variants of byuons VSs for describing the electromagnetic
ﬁeld (waves, photons). These are the pairs of byuons in VS II +I − and pairs in
VS II −I +. The later is explained by the fact that, for example, VSs II + and I −
have, ﬁrstly, the same c = c0, and secondly, they propagate in the same direction of
the R1-space (similarly for VS II −I +). Explain the former. If byuon VSs have the
same c, then, in accordance with the ideology of charge formation 13, the quantum
transitions (correlation) between them cannot lead to formation of electric charge
since to do this, the presence of VSs with opposite magnitudes of c is quite necessary
for locking information within some local region of the space R1 and hence R3.

Thus, it is qualitatively shown in the article that at the cost of varying periods
of byuon interaction, it is possible to describe the electromagnetic ﬁeld basing on
the Weyl’s geometrical theory of this ﬁeld.

4. Conclusion.

In 14,15 by using an unordinary varying the action for the system of spinor and
boson ﬁelds interacting with electromagnetic one, taking c(x, t) as a generalized

world is based on, since its fundamental properties, particularly electromagnetic
ones (the ﬁne structure constant e2/hc) determined by such constants as h, e, c,
remain unchanged on this set.

conclusions are very important as showing that the nature of gravitation may be
explained by way of developing physical views. With the use of a known fact of

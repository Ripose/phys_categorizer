We show that the locally constant force necessary to get a stable hyperbolic motion regime for
classical charged particles, actually, is a subtle combination of an applied external force and the
radiation reaction force. It suggests, as the Equivalence Principle is valid, that the gravitational
mass of charged particle should be slight greater than its inertial mass.

I. INTRODUCTION

Although it seems not to be worthwhile to spend
a lot of time studying an old problem as the ef-
fect of radiation reaction force on the charged par-
ticle dynamic [1]- [10], perhaps unsolvable without a
quantal point of view [15], [16], some aspects of such
problem, as the presence of radiation for charged
particle performing hyperbolic motion and its ab-
sence for one supported at rest in an uniform grav-
itational ﬁeld [12], [13], though both are equivalent
as the Equivalence Principle is valid, leads to a di-
chotomy between them that we can deal with just
while faced as a classical system. By the way,
we have to notice that some diﬀerent features are
emerging from radiation reaction force problem [17].
What we are going to do here is to show the condi-
tion we have to provide such that a charged particle
can reach a stable hyperbolic motion. It is neces-
sary to furnish a subtle balance between an applied
external force and the radiation reaction force to get
an hyperbolic motion regime. An important conse-
quence is that, taking account the Equivalence Prin-

2

ciple, it implies a gravitational mass that is slight
greater than the inertial mass. Perhaps because
the main experimental justiﬁcation that led Ein-
stein to formulate the Equivalence Principle, which
is one of the foundations of his General Theory of
Relativity [6], is the numerical equality between iner-
tial and gravitational mass, nowadays they are taken
quite as synonymous, so we have to be aware to
avoid misleading conclusions. Also, it is very im-
portant to emphasize the central role played by the
radiation reaction force, which seems to be missing
or may not be properly addressed in some discussion
about the subject [7], [8]. Actually, this slight upper
deviation of gravitational mass should be necessary
to validate the Equivalence Principle.
Hyperbolic motion is the natural generalization of
the concept of the Newtonian uniformly accelerated
motion due to a constant force applied to a parti-
cle, which might be due to an uniform gravitational
ﬁeld. At relativistic level, as the velocity is upper
limited by the light velocity, constant force don’t
imply constant acceleration; instead, it results the

3

above mentioned hyperbolic motion, which denom-
ination comes from the hyperbola that it is drawn
in the zt-plane by this kind of motion.
An one dimensional hyperbolic motion of a particle
of mass m occurs as a solution of the relativistic
equation of motion [9], [10]

including radiation reaction force, is given by the

is the Lorentz-Dirac relativistic radiation reaction

and it is responsible by the well known non physical
runaway solutions. The second is the Rohrlich term,
related to the power radiated

(10)

A well known condition for hyperbolic motion is

(11)

aµ − 1
.
c2aνaνvµ = 0 ,
which also implies f µ
rad(τ ) = 0, so it seems to be
easy to produce hyperbolic motion of charged parti-
cles imposing a locally constant external force, as in
the uncharged particle case, but it could be a mis-
take. To have a stable hyperbolic motion we have
to get a very sensible balance between external and
radiation reaction force, and before it the condition
(11) is not true. It means that what happen before
is very important to get a stable hyperbolic motion
regime and, although we have the same equation

6

(1) after that, the force f µ(τ ) is not just f µ
ext(τ )
anymore. To ﬁgure out why, let us consider the
Lorentz-Dirac equation written as [3]

(27)

From equations (24-27), it is easy to see that the
total force (23) satisﬁes (6) necessary to have an
hyperbolic motion.
It shows that the external force necessary to pro-
duce an hyperbolic motion of neutral particle,

fext(τ ) = f (τ ) = ma cosh λτ ,

(28)

is smaller than the external force (24) necessary to
give the same hyperbolic motion of charged particle.
All external force applied to neutral particle is used
to increase its kinetic energy,

dW
dt

= vF = mav = mac sinh λτ = mc2 dγ

.

On the other hand, for charged particle, external
force (24), that can be written as

fext(τ ) = f (τ ) − fRoh(τ ) ,

10

(29)

(30)

provides the increase of kinetic energy in the same
amount as given in (29) and supplies, through
fRoh(τ ), the energy lost carried by radiation.

III. CHARGED PARTICLES IN UNIFORM GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

We saw in the previous section that charged par-
ticle performing hyperbolic motion have to be sub-
mitted to an external force given by

Fext =

ma
2

(cid:18)

(1 + β)
(1 − λτ0)

+

(1 − β)
(1 + λτ0)

,

(cid:19)

(31)

where Fext(τ ) is the measurable force related to the
relativistic force by fext(τ ) = γFext(τ ).
The Equivalence Principle [5], [14] says that a par-
ticle at rest in the laboratory frame Rlab immersed
in an uniform gravitational ﬁeld g is seen by ob-
server in a free falling inertial frame R as performing
hyperbolic motion with local constant acceleration
a = g. The local constant force responsible by its
hyperbolic motion is the normal force Fn = −Fg
that supports the particle against the gravitational
force Fg, so, in absolute value it is equal to mg for
uncharged particle. But, for charged particle, the

11

normal force Fn must be equal to the external force
Fext of equation (31) for β = 0,
mg
Fext → Fn =
(1 − λ2τ 2
0 )

(32)

.

This result suggests that the observer in the labo-
ratory frame Rlab measures the gravitational force
acting on charged particle as

(1 − λ2τ 2

Fg =

(35)
such that there is no radiation lost of charged par-
ticle supported at rest in a gravitational ﬁeld, as
should be.
Although we are not dealing with non inertial ref-
erential, from results above we can guess that a
charged particle starting a free falling motion, when
β = 0, must be subjected to gravitational force,
equation (33), plus the Rohrlich radiation reaction
force, equation (25),

ma = m

g + FRohr .

(36)
After reaching stable free falling regime, when a →
g, the Rohrlich radiation reaction force, neglecting
the velocity, supposed to be close to zero, becomes

IV. CONCLUSION

Although the ﬁnal equation of motion of neutral
and charged particles in hyperbolic motion regime
seems to be identical, we realize that there is a fun-
damental diﬀerence between them. For charged par-
ticle, actually, the total locally constant force is the
sum of an applied and the radiation reaction forces
in a subtle combination in such a way that results
the same as for neutral particle. An extra force is
necessary to supply the same kinetic energy as for
uncharged particle plus the energy lost carried by
radiation.
An interesting implication, as the Equivalence
Principle is taken account, is that the gravitational
mass of charged particle must be greater than its

enough to not be detected by any experimental or
practical devices, but it helps us to ﬁgure out the
condition necessary to get an hyperbolic motion
regime and to understand the meaning of its equiv-
alence with a charged particle supported at rest in
an uniform gravitational ﬁeld.

14

Until now the equality between gravitational and
inertial mass was understood as the essence of the
Equivalence Principle, condition we realized not to
be true for charged particle, where, due to the pres-
ence of radiation reaction, a slight deviation of grav-
itational mass compared to inertial one is necessary
to hold the Equivalence Principle.

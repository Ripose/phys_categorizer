When considering possible time variations of fundamental physical constants
one has to keep ﬁrm well established principles. Following this approach we
keep ﬁrm the Action Principle, General Relativity (the Equivalence Principle),
and Mach’s Principle. Also we introduce a new principle under the name of
“TOTAL INTERACTION” and reconsider Weinberg’s relation with a new ap-
proach. Consistent with all these principles we ﬁnd that all masses increase
linearly with cosmological time (THE MASS BOOM) and that Planck’s con-
stant decreases also with this time.Then the whole quantum world shrinks with
time too. This is the cause of the red shift (it is an alternative to the expansion
of the Universe interpretation, and explains the BIG BANG model approach
as an apparent interpretation of the observers). The speed of light turns out to
be decreasing also with time. An “absolute” cosmological model arises, similar
to the one Einstein proposed, static, closed and ﬁnite, with the cosmological
constant included. The “relative” model, the Universe as seen from the Lab
observers, is an expanding one with a quadratic law in time for the cosmological
scale factor.

1 Introduction

The beginning of scientiﬁc cosmology can be placed with the advent of the cos-
mological equations of Einstein, as derived from his theory of general relativity. A
Universe with masses, and therefore gravitation, would be expected to contract, and
that was the case initially predicted. To avoid this, and have a static solution for
the Universe as a whole, Einstein included in his equations a cosmological constant,
the lambda term, that resulted in a push to balance gravitation. Then he obtained
a static model, with curved space giving a closed as well as ﬁnite Universe. Later
Hubble found the redshift from distant galaxies to increase with distance. One of
the possible explanations was to consider that the Universe was expanding as seen
from any observer. Of course, going backwards in time, with this interpretation the
Universe would be seen as contracting, therefore would be initially “born” from a

relatively small size and much hotter and denser than now. An expanding Universe,
found as a solution to the Einstein’s equations, was proposed by Friedman and there-
fore the scientiﬁc community had a theoretical frame to explain one interpretation of
Hubble’s discovery. The concept of an expanding Universe from an initial Big Bang
spread rapidly and has been considered the best model, and therefore the best frame,
to interpret all current observations. Nevertheless this model has many problems and
contains many paradoxes that have been in part solved with additional theoretical
inclusions (e.g. inﬂation).

In the present work we introduce the concept of a Mass Boom, already present
in the literature[1] two years ago at the IV International Congress in Hyderabad,
India, but now we present here important modiﬁcations and reﬁnements. Keeping
ﬁrst principles ﬁrm we prove that all masses grow (increase) linearly with cosmolog-
ical time. Conservation of momentum implies then that the speed of light decreases
linearly with time. It is seen that Mach’s principle, and its equivalent the princi-
ple of equivalence, give a unique solution for the Universe that excludes expansion.
We then reinterpret the redshift found by Hubble, and prove that at the labora-
tory system it is proportional to Planck’s “constant”, a result that comes from the
comparison of frequencies. The new interpretation that we present here depends
exclusively on Planck’s “constant”, that we ﬁnd decreasing with cosmological time.
The constancy of Planck’s units of time and mass completely deﬁnes the time varia-
tion of the Planck’s constant. The new model we propose for the Universe is a static,
closed and ﬁnite one, as Einstein initially proposed. On the other hand we ﬁnd a
quantum world contracting with cosmological time, in accordance with the decrease
of Planck’s constant, as interpreted from the redshift. It is clear that if we take the
quantum world as the reference, then the Universe would be apparently expanding.
It turns out that this apparent expansion is an accelerated one, something already
observed from the supernova type Ia measurements[2]. The apparent expansion we
ﬁnd is a(t) ∝ t2, for the cosmological scale factor a(t).

We then solve the cosmological equations, and ﬁnd the corresponding numerical
values for the dimensionless matter parameter Ωm = 1/3 and the lambda parameter
Ωλ = 1/3, which are very close to the values observed in many experiments. It turns
out that the apparent curvature term becomes rapidly negligible with age, so that
practically we live in a ﬂat Universe, as seen from our Lab, also a well known current
observation. The entropy of the Universe is found to be similar to the cosmological
time, as well as to the total matter of the Universe. Then, we can talk of a Mass
Boom as well as an Entropy Boom, equivalent to cosmological time.

The natural units that emerge from this model, the “true constants of nature” are
Planck’s mass and time, and of course the present size of the Universe ct ≈ 1028 cm,
which is the Planck’s length at the ﬁrst “tic” of the Universe (at the Planck’s time).
Finally, the Pioneer 10/11 anomalous acceleration [3] observed is explained by

our theory presented here.

2 The Mass Boom, Predicted by First Principles

There have been doubts whether general relativity included Mach’s principle or
not. Certainly it includes the equivalence principle, and now we will present an in-
terpretation of both principles that proves them to be equivalent. One interpretation
of Mach’s principle considers the mass (energy) of a particle m as due to its grav-
itational potential energy with respect to the mass Mu of the rest of the Universe

General relativity is based upon the equivalence principle. One way to express it in
mathematical terms is to preserve, under any sort of time-variations, the ratio of the
square of any speed due to gravitation, v2 = GM/r, to the square of the speed of
light c2, i.e.

The constancy of this ratio ensures the preservation of the principle of relativity
under cosmological time variations. If we substitute for the size r the size of the
seeable Universe, ct, and for M the mass of the Universe Mu, one gets

We see that the expressions (1) and (3) are equivalent. In the next section on the
action principle we prove that G and c3 have to be proportional to preserve the
standard form of the ﬁeld equations of general relativity. The result is that the mass
of the Universe has to be proportional to the cosmological time (the Mass Boom):

We present now what we call the total interaction principle. It is a mathematical
expression that follows the requirement that all the gravitational interactions in the
Universe must have a mean free path, under a Newtonian point of view, of the order
of the size of the Universe. Then,

Substituting the above into (5) one has

which is the same as (3), the equivalence principle, and the same as (1), the Mach’s

Finally, by using the mass of the quantum of gravity mg deﬁned elsewhere[5] as

is the time for light to travel a Compton size ~/mc one has:

so that we get by integration

and therefore we obtain again the Mass Boom eﬀect. Since Mu and m are propor-
tional to time, the number of particles of cosmological signiﬁcance in the Universe
is constant. The time dependence corresponds to the mass. The above presentation
has been submitted to Physics Essays [6].

3 The action principle

Einstein’s ﬁeld equations can be derived from an action integral following the
Least Action Principle. In standard general relativity one has for the action integral[7]:

A = IG + IM
A = −c3/(16πG)

R(g)1/2d4x + IM

where IM is the matter action and IG the gravitational term. Then one obtains the
ﬁeld equations

R

Gµν = 8π(G/c4) · T µν

We assume a space-time metric and use the Robertson-Walker model that satisﬁes
the Weyl postulate and the cosmological principle, i.e.

ds2 = c(t)2dt2 − R2(t)

MASS BOOM VERSUS BIG BANG : EINSTEIN WAS RIGHT

Einstein’s equations (13) follow from the Action (12) provided that the variation of
the coeﬃcient in the integral in equation (12) be zero. Then

c3/(16πG) = constant

We see that the assumption of a time varying G must include a time varying c to
preserve the form of the ﬁeld equations.

The equation (15) strongly suggests a speciﬁc link between mass and time. This

is

c

/G ≃ 4.04 × 10

38

grams/sec = constant

which is of the order of the ratio of the mass of the observable Universe to its age.

On the other hand, the action for a free material point is

A = −mc

ds

Z

mc = constant

To preserve standard mechanics we make the momentum mc constant, independent
from the cosmological time, then

With the constancies expressed in (15) and (18), general relativity is preserved and of
course the Newtonian mechanics too. Within these limits time variations of some of
the fundamental constants, G, c and masses, are allowed at the same time preserving
the laws of physics as we know them today. From (18) and the Mass Boom eﬀect,
the speed of light decreases linearly with time c ∝ 1/t . It is evident that, with such
a law for the speed of light, the size of the Universe (of the order of ct) is constant
and therefore there is no “absolute” expansion.

4 Reinterpretation of the Red Shift: Time Varia-

tion of Planck’s “Constant”

The ratio of frequencies observed at the laboratory system, photons from distant
galaxies as ν = c/λ and local atomic clocks as v0 ∝ mc2/~, with mc constant and λ
also constant (no expansion), gives a red shift proportional to ~. With no expansion
the red shift implies a decreasing Planck’s “constant”. Now, Planck’s units are
deﬁned as a combination of G, c and ~:

(~c/G)1/2 = 2 × 10−5 grams
Planck’s mass
(G~/c5)1/2 = 5.4 × 10−44 sec
Planck’s time
Planck’s length (G~/c3)1/2 = 1.6 × 10−33 cm

(19)

6

Antonio Alfonso-Faus

It is evident that if we choose a system of units such that G = c3, as required by the
Mass Boom eﬀect on the whole Universe, and such that ~ = c2, we get Planck’s units
of mass and time as the “natural” units of mass and time. This is very appealing
because the ratio of the mass and age of the Universe to the corresponding Planck’s
units is the same factor of about 1061. On the other hand the constant size of the
Universe, the model we present here, has a value of the order of ct = 1028 cm, which
is Planck’s length at the ﬁrst “tic” of time (at Planck’s time).

We see now that the Boom of an initial ﬂuctuation of time and mass
of the Planck’s units, by the same factor 1061, brings the ﬂuctuation up
to the state of the Universe as we observe it today in time and mass. On
the other hand the initial ﬂuctuation had a size of the order of Planck’s
length at that time, which is the constant size of the Universe.

Then, this factor of 1061 is representative of the evolution of the initial ﬂuctu-
ation, as characterized by the Planck’s units, followed then by the Mass Boom to
bring the Universe to the present conditions. The magic number of the Universe is
then 1061, as representative of its evolution from the initial ﬂuctuation up to now.
The cosmology to be studied now in this model is one that keeps G = c3, ~ = c2 and
ct = 1.

The solution for ~ = c2, as presented in the previous section, implies a redshift given
by an apparent value of a(t) ∝ t2. In the units we have selected, consistent with this
interpretation of the redshift as a decrease in ~, the curvature term in (20) decreases
as t−4 so that it is negligible, and we are observing essentially a ﬂat Universe. With
the present reasonable approximation of zero pressure (neglecting random speeds of
galaxies), and substituting a(t) ∝ t2 in (20) we ﬁnally get the cosmological equations:

These numbers are very close to the current values observed at present. The accel-
erated expansion of the Universe [2] is then an apparent eﬀect due to the quadratic
relation a(t) ∝ t2 as seen from the laboratory system.

6 Entropy of the Universe: Linear with Time

We have proved elswhere[4] that the entropy of the Universe varies linearly with
cosmological time, based upon a new approach. However, using the well known
Bekenstein [9] and Hawking [10] relations for entropy, as well as the classical deﬁni-
tion, the result is the same: there is no escape, the entropy varies linearly with time
and for the Universe the high entropy of today is due to the fact that the Universe
is very old. There is no entropy problem in our model.

Boltzmann constant k varies in our theory as c. To see this we have the photon

relation typical for blackbody radiation

kT ∝ ~c/λ

Taking the laboratory system ~ is constant and from the empirical law T λ = constant
we get k varying as c, inversely proportional to cosmological time. The apparent time
variation of T is T ∝ 1/λ ∝ 1/a(t). Hence the Bekenstein deﬁnition of entropy:

S/k ∝ Energy × size/~c ∝ M c2 × (ct)/~c ∝ t2

gives

S ∝ t

For the Hawking black hole entropy: S/k ∝ 1/~c · (GM 2) ∝ 1/~ = t2 i.e., the same
result. For the standard S = Energy/T ∝ M c2 × a(t) ∝ t we also get the same
result.

7 The Magic Numbers

The only magic number we found here is 1061 that brings the ﬁrst Planck ﬂuc-
tuation to the present state of the Universe. The Dirac magic number 1040, as the

7

(25)

(26)

8

ratio of the size of the Universe to the size of fundamental constants, and the ratio of
electric to gravitational forces, is a function of time in our approach here. Therefore
the similarity of these two values is a coincidence in our interpretation. Weinberg’s
relation [7], that can be derived by equating the gravitational cross section (6) of a
particle of mass m to the square of its Compton wavelength, is

~2

/ (Gct) ≃ m

3

(27)

The time dependence implied here for a typical mass m of a particle is m3 ∝ 1/t
which has no meaning in our approach. But at the Lab system we have ~ = constant
and then we get from (28) that m is proportional to time t, again the Mass Boom is
also present here.

8 Predictions

where [8] we get

Using the expression of the ﬁne structure constant found with no c in it else-

α ≃ e

2

2
/~ = (e/c)

(28)

There have been no cosmologically signiﬁcant time variations in α, by that meaning
variations of the order of the variation of the cosmological age considered. Then one
must have e/c = constant, and therefore the electronic charge e varies as c, inversely
proportional to t. However, in electromagnetic units (e/c) is a true constant, so that
the Zeemann displacement is a constant in this theory, contrary to the statement
made elsewhere [1]. The apparent Hubble “constant” in this theory is H = 2/t, due
to the cosmological scale factor varying as t2. Hence the Hubble age in this theory is
twice as much as the standard one. It is suggested that the age of the Universe may
be as much as twice what we have been thinking up to now. Finally the Pioneer [3]
10/11 anomalous acceleration observed can be explained here by the ratio of the
laboratory system reference frequency (~ = constant) ν1

and the frequency νp of the photon observed (~ = c2)

ν1 ∝ mc

/~ ∝ c = 1/t

2

νp ∝ mc2/~ ∝ m ∝ t

(29)

(30)

Hence we have νp/ν1 ∝ t2. This is a BLUE SHIFT, as observed, and of the
order of Hc ≃ 7 × 10−8 cm/sec2 to be compared with the observed value of about
8 × 10−8 cm/sec2.

9 Conclusions

The Mass Boom proposed, linear increase of all masses with time, implies here
a linear decrease of the speed of light. The resultant cosmological model, static,
almost ﬂat, closed and ﬁnite, has cosmological parameters in accordance with current
observations. Main problems of the standard model are solved: entropy, lambda
constant, horizon etc. In fact many of these problems are one and the same thing.
Solving one you solve them all. This is the case here.

Finally, the time reversibility of all the equations of physics poses a deep the-
oretical problem: nature has irreversible process, and this irreversibility is not now
explicit in the standard basic equations of physics (Newton’s mechanics, quantum
mechanics, general relativity, etc). With our approach the Mass Boom ensures that
irreversibility is present everywhere: in fact we have proved that it corresponds to
an Entropy Boom linear with time.

Abstract

Correlations of composites corresponding to baryons and mesons are composed
within the derivative expansion. The expansion in energy scales permits a quantita-
tive, algebraic description at various energy scales in QCD. The masses in QCD are
derived utilizing a proposed line interaction, with explicit checks of the masses up to
the baryonic decuplet.

1 Introduction

Correlator calculations in quantum chromodynamics are diﬃcult due to the com-
plicated nature of the diagrammatic expansion. The derivative expansion has been
recently developed to simplify these calculations, and in particular, to reduce the
complicated integrals to a set of almost free-ﬁeld ones. Expansions pertaining to col-
liders are naturally formulated in terms of energies, from lower to higher ones; the
derivative expansion is in this spirit. The expansion is equivalent to the usual inﬁnite
number of loop graphs, but with the small parameter being the dimensionless ratio
of energy scales as opposed to a coupling constant that could be of order unity.

One of the outstanding questions in quantum chromodynamics, and generally in
any gauge theory, is the origin of the masses of the gauge invariant states - in particular
without resorting to computationally intensive lattice gauge theory. In this work, in
addition to formulating the correlator expansions, we derive the set of masses of the
mesonic and baryonic tower of QCD masses, using the derivative expansion together
with the inclusion of Wilson-like line integrals. The latter operators are suited quite
naturally within the derivative expansion.

The masses of the composites containing the (s,d,u) multiplet, i.e. mesons and

baryons and etc, is summarized here for convenience. They follow via a formula,

At g
1, which is realistic for quantum chromodynamics, the ’propagator’ or 2-point
function for the composites has the usual spatial dependence. It is interesting that
the coupling dependence of g2 enters in this manner, which explains the diﬀerences in
the masses via its ﬂow in energies. The lowest order approximation to these masses
(containing the s,d, and u quarks) are found via the term in the exponential in (1.1).
It is calculated to contain two terms,

The terms are due to the Wilson-like interaction,

There are perturbative corrections to this formula via the power series Cj(x1, x2) in
(1.1), but the zeroth order formula in (1.2) agrees well with the known mesonic and
baryonic composites.

This work is contained in the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, and its placement
in the context of supergravity is straightforward. In previous work the mass gener-
ation of the fermion species content has been explained via gauge and gravitational
instantons [1], and when combined with the work here lends a fundamental expla-
nation of the generation of the masses of the physical QCD sector. Also, the gauge
theory work presented in the current text may be generalized to ﬁnite temperature
and supersymmetric ﬁeld theories, but is not included.

2 Brief review of QCD derivative expansion

Derivative expansions of quantum ﬁeld and string theories have recently been devel-
oped wth several goals, one of which is to determine analytically their nonperturbative
properties [1]-[9]. This expansion is identical to the usual diagrammatic expansion
in loops, but with an expansion in momentum scales as opposed to couplings. As a
result, this approach commutes with dualities in supersymmetric theories and is gen-
erally nonperturbative in couplings. One facet of this approach is that all integrals
may be performed, and theories treated in this expansion have amplitudes that may
be determined by a set of algebraic recursive equations, which are almost matrix-like.
Gauge theories have been examined brieﬂy in [1] and [2] in this context; we review
the description of microscopic correlations describing amplitudes and composite cor-
relations modeling nucleon interactions. (These correlators are quantitatively related,
however, for clarity we describe both.)

quantum chromodynamics; the non-perturbative properties via coherent state Wilson

is found from all possible combinations of gauge invariant operators

and hj(g, θ) contains the full coupling dependence. Example gauge invariant oper-
ators are TrF 2 1 F 2, and 1
ψ4. In the derivative expansion, self-consistency of the
m2
ψ
eﬀective action with unitarity, implemented via sewing, allows for a determination
of the functions hj. The action is next examined with respect to both logarithmic
modiﬁcations of the terms and regulator dependencies.

In addition to the hard dimension labeling the operator, logarithms also in general

modify the form of the generating function, through, for example,

TrF 2 [lnn1(

) lnn2(

) . . . lnnm(

)]

2F 2 ,

(2.3)

with covariantized boxes. The presence of logarithms is required by unitarity and
are generic in loop integrals; there are generically L multiplicative log terms at loop
order L in the loop expansion. These terms may be computed either in a direct sense
via their inclusion in the eﬀective theory, or may be determined by unitarity. The
mS = S†S and may be computed from the analytic
logarithms are required via
terms after their coeﬃcients are determined.

I

The form of the series expansion in terms of the operators depends on how the
gauge ﬁeld is regularized, in string theory with the string inspired regulator and
dimensional reduction. In the former there is a dimensional parameter (α′) acting
eﬀectively as a cutoﬀ; there may in general be other geometric scales depending on
the model that may serve in the same role as α′ in the following. As the generat-
ing function contains one-particle reducible graphs, there must be inverse powers of
derivatives, which are local in the sense that in momentum space these terms simply
model the propagator 1/(k2 + m2) = 1/m2

occurs, and in gauge theory their universal form, in the sense of independence of the
number of external particles in a correlator, is expected based on collinear and soft
factorizations. Last, on-shell gauge theory amplitudes have infrared singularities;
in the x-space expressions these singularities are absent as the lines are eﬀectively
oﬀ-shell.

The regulator dependence of an α′, or other dimensional parameter such as a mass
term not depending on α′ or a geometric parameter, follows in a straightforward sense
by allowing their powers to occur in the expansion, i.e. α′nm−p. This occurs in quan-
tum ﬁeld theory via the decoupling of massive states, and in low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld

theory as an expansion about an ultra-violet cutoﬀ. The general term in the eﬀective
action we consider is determined by including all gauge invariant terms discussed in
the previous paragraph together with the these dimensional paramaters. (In a dimen-
sionally regularized theory the eﬀective ultra-violet cutoﬀ is absent and only the mass
terms, with any other dimensionful parameters, occurs in the derivative expansion.)
Parameters such as Yukawa couplings in a spontaneously broken context occur in a
polynomial sense as dictated by perturbation theory.

The gauge coupling expansions of hj follow from the usual expansion of the gauge

theory amplitudes,

The coeﬃcients a(n)
are determined via the sewing relations. The instantons in the
background ﬁeld method generate ˜a; potentially these contributions are redundant
with the exponentiated gauge ﬁeld integrals.

For purposes of reviewing we formulate the four-point scattering of gauge bosons.
The eﬀective vertices to be inserted into the derivative diagrams are the interactions
(A, Amψk), (A2, Am−1ψk), and (A3, Am−2ψk). They are found by variation of the

in which the full derivative dependence has been implied in the vertices, and should
be expanded termwise. The integrals are easier to evaluate in x-space, as in [4]. The
indices of the ﬁelds have been suppressed for notational purposes. The propagators
are indexed by A and ψ. In order to generate the full amplitude at the four-point,
including the coeﬃcients at general order g2+L, we have to include the sewing relations
that generate all of the other vertices; the inﬁnite tower of unitarity relations are
coupled and together generate the complete eﬀective action corresponding to the
loop expansion.
In general this appears complicated; however, to a ﬁnite order in
coupling only a ﬁnite number of vertices are involved, which is small at low orders in
coupling. Furthermore, all of the integrals may be performed (including the massless
ones using analytic methods as outlined in [3] and [4]). If interested in computing
to high orders in gYM then the method is amenable via direct calculation or in a
computer implementation.

An explicit evaluation of the terms and integrals have been performed in massive
scalar ﬁeld theory, in an arbitrary dimension. The reader is refered to [4] to see the
simplest implementation.

Next we examine the composite operator correlations; the composite operators
Oj
model the bare nucleons in terms of free particle states. Flow of momentum amongst
the various free-particle states in the composite operator is general. A schematic is
illustrated in ﬁgure 2. In the correlations involving the composite operators, and in
order to make contact with the parton model in perturbation theory, the internal lines
of the operators (nucleons) are connected to a) full interaction vertices or b) from one
nucleon to another. In other words, the vertices (depicted in ﬁgure 4) are one particle
reducible so that the perturbative contributions to the interactions in the usual loop
expansion is obtained. The interactions are depicted in ﬁgure 3 for a sample collision
of three ψ3 hadrons. Figure 4 illustrates a usual interaction graph with that in the
derivative expansion.

3 Exponential insertions and Masses

In this section integrals along 1-cycles and 2-cycles are included in the expansion, via
the gauge ﬁeld A and the curvature F . In doing so the masses of the nucleons are
derived. Their inclusion in the correlations described in the previous section depart
from the parton model in that the realistic masses of the nucleons are obtained.

tions. The line integral we take to be oriented in accord with the action of the isospin
operator, the projection PG is an isospin operator acting on the composite operators,
with an explicit factor of a half inserted to agree with the orientation of the integral;

The dimensional parameter 1/µ2 is introduced as an eﬀective size of the Wilson loop;
its natural value at the QCD point is 150 MeV (µ = 12.23). As α scales to zero, e.g.
at high energy, these pseudo nonperturbative contributions vanish; as α approaches

in QCD is of order unity, and as a result these contributions naturally model the mass
of a nucleon.

A nucleon is not a fundamental particle, and as a result one does not expect
a propagator in the sense of ∂∂∆ =
δ to model its dynamics. The free particle
composite of n fermions, as in the parton model, has the form ∆n(x), containing
xnmψ). The mass of the nucleonic state is found by computing the correlation

One can check that the mass formula agrees quite well with the masses in the baryon
octet and decuplet, and the meson vector nonet (the bare masses of the fermions are
taken as approximately 150 MeV and 300 MeV for the (u,d) and s quarks at the
QCD scale.) This approximation is in the free-ﬁeld point of view, and resummations
of gauge interactions could modify the ’mass’ of the nucleon - in quotes because an
interacting nucleon is not really a particle. The meson octet does not nearly agree as
well as the rest; possibly this is due to the odd parity of these states and electroweak
interactions. If the quarks were massless, then a 2-quark state is diﬀerentiated from
n > 2 because of infra-red divergences, as can be seen by the ﬁrst order gluonic
correction to the two meson correlation. Furthermore, it would be interesting to
attempt to derive the subtle mass diﬀerence between the proton and neutron, or other
degenerate states; the perturbative corrections to the mass calculation are desired.

A primary aspect of the mass formula is that it exhibits approximate Reggeiza-

fermion number Nψ + NS, illustrated in ﬁgure 6.

The full 2-point correlator is obtained via inserting the vertex between the two free
nucleonic states, and also summing the exponentiated gauge interactions, depicted
in ﬁgure 7. The vertex contracts any number of sets of lines, and there may be
disconnected components connecting the lines between x1 and x2, as explained in

4 Nucleon interactions

The interactions follow via the interactions of the composite operators as described in
section 2; these reproduce on a microscopic setting the parton model. The additional
interactions to be included are those of the Wilson loops. Contrasted with the simplest
two operator correlations, these exponentiated paths may join points xj in a number
of ways for a given number of exponentials. As a nucleon is not a point particle, the
latter interactions model an eﬀective mass of the constituent composite nucleons.

5 Discussion of general gauge theory

Two primary diﬀerences between QCD and a general gauge theoy are: the ﬂow of the
coupling constant and the energy scale of the theory. These two properties change
the mass formula and the scattering of the composite states. For example, the mass
formula has a xg in the exponential and depending on the UV properties of the theory
(from the microscopic theory) the properties of the two-point correlator change; as
usual, the composites may break into free particle constituents with an eﬀective mass
containing only the bare fermions. The ﬂow equations of the coupling constant dictate
the ﬁxed points of the theory.

6 Conclusion

The correlations of nucleonic states are examined within the derivative expansion;
these correlations are identical to those of quantum chromodynamics. Additional ex-
ponential interactions, i.e. Wilson loops, are added to the interactions. Masses of the
nucleons are derived, and excellent agreement is found with the observed parameters.
They have a non-trivial dependence on the coupling constant, and in an asymptoti-
cally free limit, degenerate into the bare masses of the quark content without the gluon
contribution. Small diﬀerences in the masses at given strangeness number within the
multiplets are potentially found via perturbative corrections, for example, the mass
splittings between the neutron and proton as well as other sets. The fundamental
masses of the quarks have also been analyzed and derived in the context of M theory
via gravitational (and gauge) instantons.

Explicit calculations and diagrams are presented that explain the interactions
and methodology. In general, gauge theories may be examined in the same approach;

17

the running of the coupling constant is governed by the perturbative expansion. The
derivation of the masses and their role in the dynamics may be found in the usual
loop expansion. Generalization to gauge theory with matter at ﬁnite temperature
could be explained in the context presented in this work (with testable predictions
for example at the RHIC collider).

In the derivative expansion the calculations are much simpliﬁed over the usual
perturbative loop approach. The former is well suited to extend quantitative QCD
work well into the lower energy regimes and to have a variety of quantitative appli-
cations at various energies, with latitude.

Perturbative corrections are expected to modify the mass derivations presented
in this work. Furthermore, gauge instantons could play a role, and are possibly re-
dundant to the exponentiated line operators used in the derivation. Higher precision
calculations might be obtained with the use of further modiﬁcations to the QCD fun-
damental action, such as string (and holographic) and higher dimensional operators.

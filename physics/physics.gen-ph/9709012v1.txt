Abstract

An alternative method of generation of Cerenkev radiation is pro-
posed over here with the help of a rotating source and a reﬂector. The
principle is that, if we focus a narrow beam of light on to source of
light is rotated with certain angular velocity then the light spot on the
surface will move with very high velocity which may exceed the velocity
of light. As a consequence of this we shall observe an eﬀect very similar
to Cerknov radiation.

Introduction

It is an well established fact that a beam of light from a rotating source may

sweep out a distant path faster than the speed of light [1, 2]. This can also be

established in the following way. A narrow beam of light of monocharomatic

wavelength λ from a source O rotates in the anticlockwise direction with an

angular velocity ω and describes an angle ∆θ in time ∆t (Fig. 1). The radius

r of the circle is large (or ∆θ be very small) to consider the path of the light

spot BC stright line (Fig. 2 )

BC = l = r∆θ

∆θ = 1/r

1

ω = ∆θ/∆t

The time taken by the light ray to travel from O to B (Fig. 3) i.e. the distance

r is t. In time ∆t the light at O is rotated by an angle ∆θ and is in the direction

OC. Since, light takes a time t to travel a distance r, so it will reach the point

C after a time (t + ∆t). so, ∆t is the time taken by the light spot to travel a

distance BC = l. Therefore the velocity of the light spot is ν = 1/∆t

or, ν = r∆θ/∆t(Since, l = r∆θ)

or, ν = rω

So, the velocity of the light spot = angular velocity of the source × radius of

the circle on which the light spot moves

We can make the velocity of the light spot ν greater than the velocity of

light, either by increasing ω or by increasing r or both. As an example (Fig.

4) if a beam of laser is rotated at the surface of moon with one rotation per

second (i.e. T = 1 sec, and ω = 2π/T = 2π/1), then the velocity of the light

spot which touches the earth will move with a velocity

ν = rω = r · 2π/T

ν21.6 × 1010Con/sec.

[taking, r = 3.37 × 1010 cm, the distance between moon and earth and T = 1

sec. ]

Which is about seven times greater than the velocity of light.

The possiblity that a light-spot can move faster than light is discussed in

references 1 and 2. So, when a spot of light moves faster than the light itself

then we can expect an eﬀect very similar to Cerenkov radiation [3].

Thought Experiment

Light from the rotating source O after reﬂection from the points like B will

generate reﬂected or secondary waves (Fig. 2 and Fig. 5). Since the velocity

of this reﬂected wave is equal to the velocity of light c, which is less than of

the velocity of the light-spot, so Cerenkov radiation will be generated. This is

explained in the following paragraph.

Suppose at a given moment light from the rotating source O (Fig. 5) falls

at B1 and a reﬂected or secondary wave is generated at the point B1. Then

in the next moment as the light spot (whose velocity ν is greater than the

velocity of light c ) moves to B2, the reﬂected wave from B1 (whose velocity

is the velocity of light c) expands by a radius r1, smaller than the distance

the light-spot moves, then another wave starts from B2. When the light spot

moved still further to B3 and a wave is starting there, the wave from B2 has

now expanded to r2 and the one from B1 has expanded to r3. So, we have a

series of wave circles with a common tangent line which goes through the light

spot. The angle θ (angle between the common tangent and the line B1B3) can

be calculated easily. In a given amount of time the light-spot moves a distance

(B3 − B1), which is proportional to ν, the velocity of the light spot. In the

mean time the wavefront has moved a distance r3, proportional to the velocity

of light c, therefore, sin θ = c/ν.

Conclusion

The eﬀect is very similar to the Cerenkov radiation eﬀect where an object

moving through a medium faster than speed at which the medium carrier waves

will generate waves. When a fast moving charged particle passes through a

3

block of glass (say), and if the speed of moving particle is greater than the

speed of light in the medium then it will produce conical waves with its apex

at the source. Here, since the light-spot can move faster than the speed of light,

so it also give rise to the same eﬀect as Cerenkov radiation. The diﬀerence is

that the Cerenkov radiation emitted by the fast moving light-spot can be seen

even in vacuum. If the source O is replaced by a source of sound, then sock

waves will be generated. The source O may be replaced by a beam of electron,

proton etc. then also we will observe the similar type of eﬀect as discussed

above.

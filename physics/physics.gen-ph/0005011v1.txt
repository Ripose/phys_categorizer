About the Dependence of the Currency Exchange Rate at Time and National

Dividend, Investments Size, Diﬀerence Between Total Demand and Supply

The time dependence of the currency exchange rate K treated as a function of national dividend,
investments and diﬀerence between total demand for a goods and supply is considered. To do this
a proposed earlier general algorithm of economic processes describing on the basis of the equations
for K like the equations of statistical physics of open systems is used. A number of diﬀerential
equations (including nonlinear ones too) determining the time dependence of the exchange rate
(including oscillations) is obtained.

1. L.Ya.Kobelev et al. [1] in order to describe eco-
nomic phenomena oﬀered a system of nonlinear diﬀeren-
tial equations based on the mathematical methods of sta-
tistical physics of open systems ( [2]).(see also [3]- [11]).
The present paper is devoted to consideration of a model
example of calculation of time dependence of national
currency exchange rate treated as a function of national
dividend F , investments C and total diﬀerence between
demand and supply (with all the values being measured
in national currency units). The modality of the exam-
ple considered is in neglecting of dependencies of national
currency upon the others, not mentioned economic vari-
ables, so the main purpose of this paper is not so to
elucidate real economic laws and regularities (although
this also takes place) as to illustrate the possibilities of
the oﬀered in the named paper method if applied to a
concrete problem.

2. Thus, to show the advantages of the method used
consider the dependence of the currency exchange rate
upon investments C, diﬀerence between total demand
and supply P, and national dividend F . Let K be a vari-
ation of the currency exchange rate per time unit.
In
this case the equations describing the exchange rate as a
function of C, P and F takes the form of the simpliﬁed
equations (3), (4), (7) of the paper [1]

The equations describing time dependencies of C, P , F
and the dependence of the currency exchange rate upon
them write down as follows:

where i = 1, 2, 3 (x1 = C, x2 = P , x3 = F ), Fi and φ
are nonlinear functions of their own arguments. In eqs.
(2)-(3) the terms containing DC, DP and DF coeﬃcients
describe ”diﬀusion” in the space of the exchange rate al-
teration variables C, P , F , i.e., the distribution of K over
these variables, and the φ(K) terms describe the depen-
dence of dK
dt upon the processes regulating the velocity
of the exchange rate alteration (in particular, a currency
exchange rate relaxation, bistable states existence etc.).

Assume then that these values do not vary signiﬁcantly,
that is α = const and dC
In this case
we will have ∂K
∂t = K1 = ab and K = K1t + K2
(K2 = const.). So K will increase or decrease, depending
upon the sign of K1. In case of (7), diﬀerentiating (6) in
time and using (13) from paper [1] and (8) yield

dt = b = const.

∂2K
∂t2 + ω2

0K = 0

where ω0 = √aα. The solution of (9) has the form

K = K0 sin ω0t

where K0 is constant. So with the assumption made, the
currency exchange rate alteration K varies periodically
in time with the frequency of √aα. If the dependence
of K upon the investments made is weak, the frequency
of oscillations will be small and K will take the form
(ω0t ≪ 1)

K = K0√aαt + ...

√aαt ≪ 1

At times large enough, nevertheless, the periodicity of
the currency exchange rate varying with time will be ob-
served.

5.

Introduce now into the right-hand side of eq.(5)
a parameter characterizing the deviation of K from an
equilibrium: Ic = K−K0
τ (K) , where τ (K) is the relaxation
time for the currency exchange rate alteration if diverged
from a stationary state K0 (in general case τ is a function
of K,

liarities of nonlinear systems. Take into consideration in

8. Note, that wide opportunities to chose the equations
for ∂K
dt and IC are not ex-
hausted by the selection used in the example considered
and the concrete forms of the equations are determined
by the state of the economic processes and correlations
between them. For example, one may treat as xi vari-
ables in the case considered realized Ye and produced Yl
gross national products, the total sum of money in use,
the number of workable population N , absolute level of
unemployment δN , the part of gross national product
used by the state (these variables were used by Bystrai (
[3]) while deﬁning the economic entropy.

CONCLUSION

A general algorithm of describing economic processes
basing on the equations of statistical physics of open sys-
tems developed by Kobelev L.Ya. et al. [1] was used to
describe the time dependence of the national currency
exchange rate as a function of national dividend, invest-
ments size and diﬀerence between total demand for the
goods and its supply. A number of nonlinear diﬀerential
equations describing the time dependence of exchange
rate (in particular, oscillations in diﬀerent cases) were
obtained.

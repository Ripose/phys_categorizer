Question. Negative Group Delays and Action-at-a-Distance
(submitted to the section “Questions and Answers” of “Am. J. of Phys.”)

In the recent issue of American Journal of Physics M. W. Mitchell and
R. Y. Chiao1 discuss the causality and negative group delays in the series of
the experiments on the superluminal propagation of electromagnetic waves
(see references therein).

We have a question. On p. 14 the authors wrote “it is not the group
velocity, but rather the front velocity that must be no greater than c by
Einstein causality”; on the other hand on p. 17 the authors wrote “...the
front... reaches the input and the output of each ampliﬁer at the same time”.
We do not understand how one should reconcile these two expressions.

Even if one assumes that the time of ﬂight for light to cross from the
input to the output is completely negligible on the scale of the typical time
scales for the pulses and “the front reaches the input and the output of each
ampliﬁer at the [almost] same time”, it is also not comprehensible for us
(in the framework of the Einstein claim about the c as the limiting velocity)
the following expression [p.18, Eq. (12)]: “...the output depends only on the
present and past values of the input (and not on future values)”. Theoret-
ically we agree (we are theorists). But, in our opinion, this statement (in
comparison with the previous statements) also can cause misunderstandings:
if the output depends on the present values of the input (see the term Vin(t)
in Eq. (12), t is the same time, not retarded!), does the above statement sig-
nify that there is information in the output which comes with the “inﬁnite
velocity”, thus approving the action at a distance,2 does not it?

In this context we wonder if the formalism of the causal Green function
(Vout(t) = Vin(t) + retarded terms, Eq. (12)1) contradicts with what Einstein
and his successors told us? We wonder, if it is possible to construct some
device in order to check experimentally, whether the front comes at the same
time or at the almost same time.

We review the available evidence according to which physical media alter the
Minkowskian spacetime with consequential alteration of the speed of light; we
point out the apparent emergence of superluminal speeds within the hyperdense
hadrons; and we point out the lack of conclusive character of the available
related measure, those on the behaviour of the meanlives of unstable kaons
with energy.

Keywords: lifetime measurements, neutral kaon decays, speed of light in media,
isominkowskian

Data on local speeds of light. Strictly speaking, the speed of electromagnetic (elm) waves is not
a ”universal constant”, but rather a quantity c = co/n depending on local physical conditions repre-
sentable via the index of refraction n, where co is the speed in vacuum. When experimentally established,
deviations from co are then rather forceful evidence of deviations from the conventional Minkowskian
spacetime of the vacuum [1a].

Speeds c = co/n < co are known in our Newtonian environment. Lesser known is the fact that one of
the ﬁrst studies on the implications of speeds c < co were ﬁrst studied by Lorentz [1b] (see the related
mention in Pauli’s book [1c]).

Speeds c = co/n > co have been apparently measured by A. Enders and G. Nimtz [1d] in the tunneling
of photons between certain guides (see review [1e] for additional references and details). Apparent speeds
c = co/n > co have also been identiﬁed in certain astrophysical events [1f-1h] (see also the recent data
[1i]).

Note that the hopes of regaining the exact Minkowskian spacetime by reducing light to photons
scattering among molecules, even though valid as a ﬁrst approximation, is no longer viable because: 1)
the reduction to second quantization is questionable for elm waves in our atmosphere, say, with one
meter wavelength; 2) the reduction does not permit quantitative studies of superluminal speeds; and 3)
the reduction eliminates the representation of the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of physical media, which
have apparent, experimentally measurable eﬀects (see below).

Recall that hadrons are not ideal spheres with isolated points in them, but rather some of the densest
media measured in laboratory until now. If spacetime anomalies are established for media of relatively low
density, the hypothesis that the Minkowskian spacetime can be exact within hadrons in its conventional
realization has little scientiﬁc credibility (see below for the exact character of an axiom-preserving covering
spacetime). Also, deviations are expected from the complete mutual penetration of the wavepackets of
the constituents, thus resulting in the historical open legacy of the existence of nonlinear, nonlocal and
nonpotential eﬀects in the interior of hadronic.

1

One of the ﬁrst quantitative studies of the above legacy was done by D. L. Blokhintsev [2a] in 1964,
followed by L. B. Redei [2b], D. Y. Kim [2c] and others. Note that the exact validity of the Minkowskian
geometry for the center-of-mass behavior of a hadron in a particle accelerator is beyond scientiﬁc doubts.
[2a-2c] then argued that a possibility for internal anomalies due to nonlocal and
The authors of Refs.
other eﬀects to manifest themselves in the outside is via deviations from the conventional Minkowskian
behavior of the meanlives of unstable hadrons with the speed v (or energy E).
Note that the Minkowski metric can be written η = Diag.(1, 1, 1, −c2

o). Therefore, any deviation ˆη
from η necessarily implies a deviation from co, as one can see by altering any component of the metric
and then using Lorentz transforms.

Along these lines, R. M. Santilli [2d] submitted in 1982 the hypothesis that contact-nonpotential inter-
actions (thus including the strong interactions as per the above legacy) can accelerate ordinary (positive)
masses at speed bigger than the speed of light in vacuun much along the subsequent astrophysical mea-
sures [1f-1h]. The above hypothesis implies that photons travel inside the hyperdense hadrons at speeds
bigger than that in vacuum. V. de Sabbata and M. Gasperini [2e] conducted the ﬁrst phenomenological
veriﬁcation within the context of the conventional gauge theories supporting the hypothesis of Ref. [2d],
and actually reaching limit speeds up to 75co for superheavy hadrons.

The above hypothesis is also supported by the phenomenological calculations conducted by H. B.
Nielsen and I. Picek [2f] via the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Higgs sector of conventional
gauge theories, which have resulted in the anomalous Minkowskian metrics (here written in the notation
above)

As one can see, calculations [2f] conﬁrm speeds of photons c = co/n > co for the interior of kaons, as
conjectured in Ref. [2d]. Recall that: spacetime anomalies are expected to increase with the density; all
hadrons have approximately the same size; and hadrons have densities increasing with mass. Therefore,
results similar to (2) are expected for all hadrons heavier than kaons, as supported by phenomenological
studies [2e].

The ﬁrst direct experimental measures on the behavior of the meanlife of K o

S with energy, τ (E), were
[3a] at Fermilab and they suggested deviations from the Minkowskian
done by S. H. Aronson et al.
spacetime in the energy range of 30 to 100 GeV. Subsequent direct measures also for K o
S were done by S.
H. Aronson et al. [3b] also at Fermilab, suggesting instead no deviations of τ (E) from the Minkowskian
form in the diﬀerent energy range of 100 to 400 GeV.

More recently, a test of the decay law at short decay times was made by the OPAL group at LEP
[3c]. In the latter experiment the ratio of number of events Z 0 → τ +τ − with deviations of τ from the
conventional law to number of ”normal” events was (1.1 ± 1.4 ± 3.5)%.

Isominkowskian geometrization of physical media. A geometrization of all deviations from the
Minkowskian spacetime was submitted by Santilli [4a] in 1983 under the name of isominkowskian ge-
ometry (see [4b] for the latest account) and resulted to be: ”axiom-preserving” (in the sense that the
isominkowskian geometry is isomorphic to the conventional one, a property denoted with the preﬁx
”iso”); ”invariant” (in the sense of admitting a symmetry isomorphic to the Poincar´e symmetry [4a-4d];
and ”universal” (in the sense of admitting all inﬁnitely possible, well behaved, signature-preserving and
symmetric modiﬁcations of the Minkowski metric [4e]).

Moreover, the isominkowskian geometry has permitted the exact reconstruction of the special relativity
under arbitrary local speeds of light [4f]. Refs. [4] have therefore established that, contrary to a popular
belief (see, e.g., the ”Lorentz asymmetry” of Ref.
[2f]), the Minkowskian axioms, the Lorentz and
Poincar´e symmetry and the special relativity remain exact under all the above spacetime anomalies, of
course, when properly formulated.

The isominkowskian geometry is essentially characterized by the lifting of the Minkowskian metric
η → ˆη = ˆT × η, where ˆT (x, v, E, µ, τ, ω, ...) is a positive-deﬁnite 4 × 4 matrix with an arbitrary local
dependence on coordinates x, speeds v, energies E, ensities µ, temperatures τ , frequencies ω, and any
other needed variable. . Jointly, the basic unit of the Minkowski space, I = Diag. (1, 1, 1, 1), is lifted
by an amount which is the inverse of the deformation of the metric, I → ˆI = 1/ ˆT . The dual lifting

η → ˆη = ˆT × η and I → ˆI = 1/ ˆT then implies the preservation of all original spacetime axioms [4] (see
Ref. [41-4k] for mathematical studies and [4l] for physical proﬁles).

The isominkowskian geometry provides a geometrization of physical media at bopth the classical
and operator levels [4l]. Since ˆT is positive-deﬁnite, ˆη can always be diagonalized in the form ˆη =
Diag. (1/n2
4), thus providing a geometrization of: the local inhomogeneity (e.g., via
a dependence of the n’s from the density); the local anisotropy (e.g., via a diﬀerentiation between the
space and time n’s); as well as arbitrary local speeds of elm waves (via the expression c(x, µ, ω, ...) =
co/n4(x, µ, ω, ...) ﬁrst proposed in [4a]).

and includes all existing or otherwise possible laws [2] via diﬀerent power series expansions in terms of
diﬀerent parameters with diﬀerent truncations [4e]. This eliminates the ambiguity of individually testing
the several diﬀerent laws of Refs. [2].

Note that, when a hadron is studied from the outside, one evidently can only use the average of the
n-quantities to constants, called ”characteristic constants” of the medium considered. Note also that a
possible anysotropy of the medium implies a deviation from the conventional Doppler shift studied by
Mignani [5a] and others which will be studied elsewhere as a possible complement to measures [2,3]. Note
ﬁnally that the latter anomalies are eliminated by the reduction of of light to photons moving in vacuum
and scattering among molecules.

Isotopic law (3) was applied by F. Cardone, R. Mignani and R. M. Santilli [5b] to the experimental

data of Refs. [3a,3b] resulting in the single ﬁt of both experiments,

4 = 1.003 ± 0.002.

(4)

Therefore, even under the assumption of the correct character of measures [3b], they do not establish
the validity of the Minkowskian geometry inside hadrons because of the above isominkowskian ﬁt. Note
also that ﬁt (4) conﬁrms the superluminal character of the propagation of light within the hyperdense
hadronic media, a property that appears to be conﬁrmed by other studies (see the outline in [4b]). We
should ﬁnally mention that nonlinear and nonlocal eﬀects at short distances have been recently studied
in Refs. [5d,5e,4l].

An alternative data elaboration.
In this note we focus the attention on the range-energy selection
rule which can be applied to re-elaborate the initial data on KS decays from the experiment [3b]. By
taking into account the results as they were done, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of the main
features of experiment [3b] and made our own ﬁts for K o
S. Our conclusions and recommendations are the
following:

1) We agree that the parameters in the full formula dN/dt for the proper time evolution are strongly
correlated. This may cause a generally non-relevant regular dependence of the parameters on entities
which are not present in the formula, such as number of runs, energy, etc., apart from the systematic un-
certainties. Therefore, the above dependence may shadow the weak energy dependence we are interested
in, as can be seen from the large values of the correlation elements.

2) The authors of Ref. [3b] solved the problem of non-correlated ﬁt by selecting the K o

S momenta
greater than 100 GeV/c. By means of that energy cut, they obtained the data sample in which the CP
violating terms contribute up to 1.6%. However, it seems unrealistic to look for the deviations from the
Minkowskian decay law of the order of some percent. More realistic is to test the decay law on the level
of 10−3, as suggested by studies [2]. In fact, the assumption of 1.6% contribution from PC violation in
[3b] implies looking for the energy dependence of τs at the level k · 10−2,
the data elaboration of Ref.
thus rendering meaningless to look for more realistic deviations of the order of 10−3 and smaller.

3) we propose to suppress the CP violating terms signiﬁcantly using selection rule for the ratio R/E,
where R and E are K o
S range and energy. In the experiment, R/E ranges from 2.3 to 36.1 cm/GeV. The
R/E interval should be selected to make the contribution of the CP violating terms less than a desirable
value, say k · 10−3. An eﬀective (R, E) plot can then be calculated via Monte Carlo methods applied to
the real decay volume.

The price we pay for more accurate data han-
dling due to the range-energy selection rule will
be lower statistics. In fact, under the above new
assumptions, 60-70% events will be rejected, i.e.,
only 63K - 84K events of the total 220K will be
useful. Apart from the loss of a major part of
the data, 1/3 of the decay volume in the experi-
ment turns out to be also useless. The large ineﬃ-
ciency of the experiment occurred because it had
not been optimized for the problem. Basicly, the
experimental design and data selection rules fol-
lowed that of conventional KS, KL studies.

We illustrate the above arguments with two ﬁts
shown in Fig. 1. 220 000 KS decays at six energy
values (from 125 to 375 GeV) were generated in
the decay volume with the ranges from 9.3 m to
25.3 m. The energy dependence of the lifetime
was assumed in the form τ (E) = τS(1 + ǫE) with
τS = 0.8927, the world average of the mean life-
time, and ǫ = 4·10−5. After applying the range-
energy selection rule, a sample of 64K events was
chosen for which the contribution of the CP vio-
lating terms was less then 0.008. Namely we deal
with the following distribution for the proper life-
time:

1 - τ(E)=p1
2 - τ(E)=τ
o(1 + p1E)
3 - τ(E)=p2(1 + p1E)

where N is a normalization constant, x = t/τ (E) and CP violating terms are equal to

CPV = | η+− |2 exp(−xy) + 2D | η+− | cos(∆m t − φ+−)exp(−x(1 + y)/2)

where y stands for τS(E)/τL.

The values of other parameters are taken as the world average values. These are | η+− | = 2.284·10−3,
L → π+π− decay, φ+−=43.7o, and ∆m =

(N − ¯N )/(N + ¯N ) where N ( ¯N ) is the number of K o ( ¯K o) produced by the proton beam on the target.
We accepted the value D=0.75.

In Fig. 1 the sequence of the mean proper lifetimes is plotted versus E, K o

S laboratory energies. The
S decays in the experimental volume under the conditions

dependence was obtained by simulations of K o
described above. The ﬁgure presents also results of three ﬁtting procedures:
a) one-parameter ﬁt by a constant function τ (E) = c with c=0.90±0.01 and χ2/ndf = 0.7/5 (dashed line
1);
b) one-parameter ﬁt by the energy-dependent formula of the type τ (E) = 0.8927(1 + p1E) with the
obtained value of the parameter p1 = (4 ± 5)·10−5 and χ2/ndf = 0.38/5 (solid line 2);
c) two-parameter ﬁt to the formula of Ref. [3b], τ (E) = p2(1 + p1E).
In this case, the value of
the crucial parameter p1 is equal to (4 ± 23)·10−5 with χ2/ndf = 0.38/4 (dotted line 3 which coinsides
practically with solid line 2).

There is a diﬀerence in interpretation of parameters in the two ﬁtting formulae with the energy
dependence. The parameter p2 in the ﬁt from the cited paper was interpreted as the zero-energy mean
value of the proper lifetime. We think that it is diﬃcult to extrapolate the ﬁtting formulae from the
energy interval 100-400 GeV to zero. Instead, we try to ﬁnd the energy dependence in the limited energy
interval by ﬁt starting from a deﬁnite point. This diﬀerence in interpretation is important because, in
general, various approaches in ﬁtting procedures may lead to crucially diﬀerent numerical results.

4

Thus, in the selected amount of the events, both ﬁts dig up well the mean value of the hidden parameter
ǫ determining the energy dependence in the simulated K o
S decays, however the error bars diﬀer strongly.
Though both results for ﬁtting values of p1 are still insigniﬁcant statistically even in the selected sample
of events, the 100% error bar in our ﬁt being rather promising. It opens the door for new manipulations
with the selection procedure aiming to improve the result. So we encourage the re-elaboration of the
original data of ref. [3b] under the modiﬁed selection rules to obtain possible hopeful estimations of τ (E)
instead of previous hopeless ones.

We ﬁnally note that no ﬁrm spacetime anomalies can be established via the above re-elaboration for
PC violating contributions smaller than 1.6% because said anomalies are visually within the errorbars
(Fig. 1) due to insuﬃcient statistuics and other reasons. Corresponding deviations cannot be considered
for PC violating contribution larger than 1.6% because the latter are experimentally known to be excluded
for the energy range of measures [3b]. Despite that, the analysis of this note establishes the insuﬃciencies
of both measures [3a,3b] and the need for novel more accurate measures.

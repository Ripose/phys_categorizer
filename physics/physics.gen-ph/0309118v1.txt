Maximum force and minimum distance: physics in limit statements

Christoph Schiller, christoph.schiller@motionmountain.org

March 2003, revised September 2003

Abstract

Special relativity, quantum theory and general relativity are summarized in one fundamental
limit statement each. Each statement is a simple limit statement for a physical observable.
The three statements fully contain the three theories and are fully equivalent to their standard
formulations. In particular, the statement for general relativity afﬁrms the existence of a
maximum force in nature. Taken together, the three fundamental limit statements imply a
bound for every physical observable, from acceleration to size and power. The limit values
differ from the usual Planck values only by numerical factors of order unity.

The need for simple physics

At dinner parties physicists are often asked to summarise physics in a few sentences. This
paper presents and explores a simple set of statements to answer the request. In addition,
these statements provide an interesting way to deduce some less known extremal principles
of nature that are less commonly found in the literature or in the classroom.

Physics is the science that explores the properties of motion. The basic theories of physics
– special relativity, quantum theory, ﬁeld theory and general relativity – all make clear
statements on the properties of motion observed in nature. Each of the four theories can be
summarised in one sentence.

Ref. 1

Special relativity in one statement

We start with special relativity.
There is a maximum speed in nature.

It can be summarised by a single statement on motion:

For all systems:

v 6 c

.

(1)

The speed v is smaller than the speed of light for all physical systems; ∗ in particular, this
limit is valid both for composed systems as well as for elementary particles. The statement

A physical system is a region of space-time which contains energy, whose location can be followed over time
∗
and which interacts incoherently with its environment. Speed is deﬁned as the energy velocity relative to a
nearby observer.

1

is valid for all observers. ∗∗ No exception to the statement is known. Only a maximum
speed ensures that cause and effect can be distinguished in nature, i.e. that sequences of
observations can be deﬁned. The opposite statement, implying the existence of (long-lived)
tachyons, has been explored in great detail; it leads to numerous conﬂicts with observations.
The existence of a maximal speed in nature leads to observer-dependent time and space
coordinates, to length contraction, time dilation and all other effects that characterise special
relativity. Finally, only the existence of a maximum speed leads to the principle of maximum
aging and the principle of least action.

Quantum theory in one statement

In the same way, all of quantum theory can be summarised by a single statement on motion:
There is a minimum action in nature.

For all systems:

S >

.

¯h

(2)

R

−

U dt , and states that between two observations performed at times t and t + D

Also this statement is valid both for composite and elementary systems. This action limit
is used less frequently than the speed limit. It starts from the usual deﬁnition of the action,
t ,
S =
even if we do not know what the system has done in the meantime, the action is at least
¯h/2. In other words, there is always a minimum change between two observations of a sys-
tem. The statement expresses a fundamental fuzziness of nature. From this single statement
one can deduce the uncertainty relation, tunnelling, entanglement, permutation symmetry,
the appearance of probability, the minimum entropy value, the information theory aspect of
quantum theory and the existence of elementary particle reactions. Details of this discus-
sion can be found in various textbooks. Again, no exception to the statement is known. A
minimum action has been observed for fermions, bosons, laser beams, matter systems and
for any combination of them. The opposite statement, implying the existence of change
that is arbitrary small, has been explored in detail; Einstein’s long discussion with Bohr, for
example, can be seen as a repeated attempt by Einstein to ﬁnd experiments which allow to
measure arbitrary small changes in nature. In every case, Bohr found that this aim could not
be achieved.

The existence of a minimal or quantum of action in nature is not a new fact; it was known
right from the beginning of quantum theory. The quantum of action is at the basis of all
descriptions of quantum theory, including the many-path formulation and the information-
theoretic descriptions. The quantum of action does not add or take away anything from
quantum theory: it was and remains completely equivalent to all standard textbook devel-
opments.

Field theory in one statement

Also electrodynamics and the nuclear interactions can be summarised by a single statement
on motion: Any two systems interact in a different way than by gravity alone. Their relative

An observer is a physical system able to record observations.

acceleration differs from that due to gravity.

For any two systems:

= agrav

.

(3)

For example, many systems in nature interact through electromagnetism. Field theory states
that even neutral bodies with charged constituents interact electromagnetically. Effects such
as the Van der Waals force or the Casimir effect make the point.

The strength of the electromagnetic interaction is described by the ﬁne structure constant.
Together with the minimum action observed in nature, we can deduce that matter interacting
electromagnetically shows a minimum electrical charge. In other words, by combining the
results of quantum theory and the properties of interactions we get the well-known fact
that in nature, everything that moves is made of particles. A limit value for each coupling
constant can also be deduced. However, we will not study interactions in more detail in the
present discussion.

General relativity in one statement

Least known of all is the possibility to summarise general relativity in a single statement on
motion: There is a maximum force in nature.

For all systems: F 6

c4
4G

.

(4)

Let us explore the limit in some detail, as this formulation of general relativity is not com-
mon. The statement contains both the speed of light c and the constant of gravitation G; it
thus indeed qualiﬁes as a statement from general relativity. Like for the previous statements,
it is stated to be valid for all observers.

The maximum force is achieved in nature only in one case: it is the force on a test body
on the horizon of a black hole, as seen by an observer located at spatial inﬁnity. In all other
situations in nature the gravitational force on a test body is always smaller than the force
limit. Also the electromagnetic and nuclear interactions never achieve this limit, as is easily
checked.

The force limit also implies that even if point particles meet and interact, their paths must
be curved. More precisely, the limit implies that the path curvature is limited in value, so
that the paths of colliding particles cannot be zigzag lines. Indeed, such zig-zag lines have
never been observed. Even though zig zag paths are usually drawn in Dyson–Feynman
diagrams, gravity does not allow them. Furthermore, a maximum force implies that there
are no singularities in nature. And indeed, no singularities have been observed so far.

Force is the derivative of energy with respect to distance. The maximum force implies
that in nature there is a maximum energy gain per distance. Indeed, even a massless system
cannot gain more energy over a distance d than by turning itself into a black hole of that
same size d. But this is exactly what the force limit states. A force limit implies that black
holes are possible.

The maximum force is valid for all observers. Even for a moving observer, when the
force value is increased by the (cube of the) relativistic dilation factor, or for an accelerating
observer, when the observed acceleration is increased by the acceleration of the observer
itself, the force limit still holds. Indeed, black holes show this behaviour.

The force limit makes clear statement on system sizes. Take a planet circling a massive
star at distance R. For an observer located on the star, the star imparts an acceleration a
on the planet. For a moving and distant observer, the observed acceleration amov is limited
– from special relativity – by 2Ramov 6 c2. On the other hand, the moving observer can
observe the planetary system only if the system remains larger than a black hole, i.e. if
R > 2GM/c2. The last two limits combined yield the force limit. In other words, the force
limit tells us that systems bound by gravity turn into black holes when they reach small
enough dimensions.

We also know that black holes, or all other systems described by a combination of gravity
In short, a maximum force

and relativity, imply that space and space-time are curved.
implies that ﬂat space and ﬂat space-time are not compatible with gravitational attraction.

But the force limit also tells us something about the strength of gravity. We can combine
the force limit with our knowledge that at large distances, gravitation is the only interaction
between systems. We then take the limit for which speeds are much smaller than the speed
of light. This condition implies v
≪
≪
c2. For a satellite circling a central mass at distance R, there is only one characteristic
speed. Whenever this speed v is much smaller than c, v2 must be both equal to al = 2aR
and to √4Gma. Large distances and low speeds thus implies that a = Gm/R2 describes the
interaction between systems. In other words, the force limit of nature implies the universal
law of gravity for large distances and low velocities, as is expected.

c2. Now the force limit requires √4Gma

c and al

≪

We also note that only a ﬁnite maximum force gives sense to the principle of maximum
aging and to the principle of least action that govern all motion described by general rela-
tivity. If forces in nature could be inﬁnite in magnitude, time would stop for an observer
subject to such a force. In short, only a ﬁnite maximum force is compatible with observa-
tion.

In other words, we ﬁnd that the maximum force of nature is compatible with general
relativity and includes universal gravity. As a result, we can make three clear statements on
motion:

quantum theory:

special relativity:

S >

¯h
2
v 6 c

general relativity:

F 6

c4
4G

(5)

These limits, together with the statement about the fundamental interactions, namely a
=
agrav, can be taken as a summary of twentieth century physics. The limits (5) are valid for
all physical systems, whether composed or elementary, and are valid for all observers.

Equivalent limits for quantum theory

To continue with the discussion, we deduce some additional limits which will be useful in
the following. First of all, by using the action bound S 6 pd 6 mcd we ﬁnd that the quantum
of action implies a limit on the displacement d of a system between two observations:

from quantum theory:

d >

(6)

¯h
2mc

.

4

6
In other words, we recover (half) the (reduced) Compton wavelength of quantum theory as
lower limit to the displacement of a system. Since the quantum displacement limit applies
in particular to an elementary system, the limit is also valid for the size of a composite
system. However, the limit is not valid for the size of elementary particles.

The action limit of quantum theory also implies Heisenberg’s well-known indeterminacy

relation for the displacement and momentum of systems:

from quantum theory:

D d D p >

.

(7)

¯h
2

It is valid both for massless and for massive systems. All this is textbook knowledge, of
course.

Equivalent limits for special relativity

Like quantum theory, also special relativity limits the size of systems, independently of
whether they are composed or elementary. Indeed, the speed limit implies that acceleration
a and size l cannot be increased independently without bounds, as the two ends of a system
must not interpenetrate. We need to distinguish massive and massless systems:

from special relativity, for m > 0:

from special relativity, for m = 0:

(8)

l 6

l >

c2
a

,

c
2 fmax

.

We recall that an electromagnetic wave train is also a physical system. Since it has no
mass, the limit is written using its highest frequency. These size limits are also valid for
the displacement d of a system, if the acceleration or frequency measured by an external
observer is used.

Also these limits imply an indeterminacy relation. Again, they are best written separately

for massive and massless systems:

from special relativity, for m > 0:
from special relativity, for m = 0:

l D a 6 c2
l D

,
f > c/2 .

The massless case gives the usual relation for wave trains and the massive case applies to
extended matter systems. All this is textbook knowledge as well.
We note that by combining the limits (6) and (8) we obtain

(9)

(10)

for quantum systems:

a 6

2mc3
¯h

.

This maximum acceleration for systems in which gravity plays no role is discussed in many
publications. No experiment has ever reached the limit, despite numerous attempts.

Ref. 3

Equivalent limits for general relativity

General relativity provides a limit on the size of systems whenever a lot of matter is concen-
trated into a small volume. The limit appears because a maximum force implies a limit to

5

D
D
the depth of free fall, as seen from an observer located far away. Indeed, the speed of free
fall cannot reach the speed of light; the ever-increasing red-shift during fall, together with
spatial curvature, then gives an effective maximum depth of fall. A maximum depth of fall
gives a minimum size or diameter l of massive systems. To see this, we rewrite the force
limit in nature as

4Gm
c2

6

c2
a

.

The right side is the upper size limit of systems from special relativity. The left side is the
Schwarzschild length of a massive system. The effects of space-time curvature make this
length the lower size limit of a physical system:

(11)

(12)

from general relativity:

l >

4Gm
c2

.

The size limit is only achieved for black holes, those well-known systems which swallow
everything that is thrown into them. Whether elementary particles achieve this limit or not
remains one of the open issues of modern physics, as at present, neither experiment nor
theory allow clear statements on their size. In any case, all composite systems in nature
comply with the lower size limit.

Ref. 4

General relativity also implies an ‘indeterminacy relation’:

from general relativity:

(13)

D E
l

6

c4
4G

.

Since experimental data is available only for composite systems, we cannot say yet whether
this inequality also holds for elementary particles. The relation is not as popular as the
previous two, but common knowledge in general relativity.

We note that the limit quantities of special relativity, quantum theory and general relativ-
ity can also be seen as the right hand side of the respective indeterminacy relations. Indeed,
the set (7, 9, 13) of indeterminacy relations or the set (6, 8, 12) of length limits are fully
equivalent to the three limit statements (5) of relativity and quantum theory. Each set of
limits can be seen as a summary of twentieth century physics, if they are complemented by
the statement on the effects of interactions.

A short excursion on general relativity’s indeterminacy relation

Even though the indeterminacy relation of general relativity does not limit the product of
two errors, but only their quotient, it has interesting consequences. Despite its different
form, it still implies that there is always a minimum error, both for length and mass mea-
surements. This is valid even in general relativity. As a result, there are minimum errors also
for all time and energy measurements. Adding the indeterminacy relation of special relativ-
ity, we get that any error on either mass, time or space has inﬂuence on the other two, and
thus on any other physical observable. In summary, even in classical physics, measurement
errors cannot be avoided.

The experimental data supports the indeterminacy relation of general relativity. Before
we explore an example, we note that in the discussion it is important to include the mea-
surement time, if only implicitly. In general relativity, measurement errors decrease with

6

D
observation time, as we are used to assume and expect in any classical system. For example,
longer measurement times allow better averaging. The two measurement errors of general
relativity’s indeterminacy relation should be based on the same measurement time.

We take an example that concerns us directly: the solar system. We can take as a rough
estimate for the displacement error of the solar system the sun–earth distance error. Using
measurements made over a duration of about thirty years with help of satellites, radio waves
and radar systems, the measurement error on the sun–earth distance was narrowed down to
30 m. The present error in the mass–energy of the sun (with about the same measurement
1030 kg. The error value
period) can be taken from the literature mass value of 1.988 43(3)
1025 kg, multiplied with 4G/c2, leads to 8 cm, which is indeed smaller than the distance
3
error, as predicted. ∗∗∗

The study of the general relativity’s indeterminacy relation (13) raises numerous ques-
tions on nature’s limits. For example, does general relativity’s lower size limit also imply a
lower limit to the displacement of physical systems? On one hand, the analogy with special
relativity and with quantum theory is suggestive. On the other hand, we are used to think
that in relativity, positions can be varied in a continuous manner and that energy errors can
be made as small as desired.

In every measurements of a large system, and in particular for general relativistic or
classical gravitating systems, errors diminish with observation time.
If we perform two
measurements on a system, the (meaningful) observation time that determines the measure-
ment errors cannot be larger than this time interval. We thus claim that the indeterminacy
relation (12), which implies two measurements, also provides a limit on the displacement
of physical systems.

Einstein has discussed for years with Bohr on ways to overcome the indeterminacy re-
lation of quantum theory. An equally intense discussion on the indeterminacy relation of
general relativity is missing up to now. For example, no explicit experimental checks of the
relation have been published, to the author’s knowledge. In fact, no experiment so far came
even close to checking the relation. Such an experimental test would be an additional way
to check general relativity against competing theories. Millisecond pulsars could provide
such a test in the future.

Thermodynamics in one statement

For completeness, we mention that thermodynamics can also be summarized in a single
statement on motion: There is a smallest entropy in nature.

For any thermal system:

S > k

.

The result is almost 100 years old; it was stated most clearly by Leo Szilard. In the same
way as in the other ﬁelds of physics, also this result can be phrased as a indeterminacy
relation:

Ref. 5

(14)

(15)

from thermodynamics:

D U > k .

D 1
T

Such arguments raise a simple puzzle: what is the best estimate for the distance and mass of the sun if the

∗ ∗ ∗
measurement time is limited to one millisecond? Is it smaller or larger than that of the ancient Greeks?

Ref. 6

This relation has been already given by Bohr and was discussed by Heisenberg and many
others. We mention it here in order to complete the list of indeterminacy relations and fun-
damental constants.

Deducing additional limits of nature

If we combine the three fundamental limits (5) – or the other equivalent limit sets just
mentioned – we obtain a number of additional results for the motion and the size of physical
systems. We start with those limits which are valid generally, both for composite and for
elementary systems:

With the additional knowledge that in nature, space and time can mix, we get

Of course, speed, action and force are limited as already stated. Within a small numerical
factor, for every physical observable these limits correspond to the Planck value. (The limit
values are deduced from the commonly used Planck values simply by substituting G with
4G and ¯h with ¯h/2.) These values are the true natural units of nature. In fact, the most
aesthetically pleasing solution is to redeﬁne the usual Planck values for every observable to
these extremal values by absorbing the numerical factors into the respective deﬁnitions. In
the following, we call the redeﬁned limits the (corrected) Planck limits and assume that the

8

factors have been properly included. In other words, the natural unit or (corrected) Planck
unit is at the same time the limit value of the corresponding physical observable.

We note that the set of Planck limits is consistent. Products and ratios of Planck limits
again yield Planck limits, as is expected. We stress that the limits are valid for every ob-
server, every situation and every physical system. Whether we look at the stars, the origin
of the universe, the world of high energy physics or at black holes, the limits are always
valid. In fact, ﬁnding the physical system that approaches the limit as much as possible is
often a fascinating adventure.

Most of these limit statements are found scattered around the literature. The existence
of a smallest measurable distance and time interval of the order of the Planck values are
discussed in quantum gravity and string theory. A largest curvature has been discussed in
quantum gravity. The statement of a maximum power – or luminosity – is known from grav-
itational wave studies, where it is stated that no star, i.e. no physical system, can be brighter
than this limit value. In addition, the statement also limits the power of any conceivable
engine. It is easy to see the reason: any engine that works in free space uses some fuel and
emits exhausts. An engine that attempts to beat the power limit produces so exhausts which
are so massive that the gravity from these exhausts limits the acceleration of the system
itself. ∗∗∗∗

The maximal mass density appears in the discussions on the energy of the vacuum. The
minimal entropy is deduced from the smallest change in nature and was discussed above; it
corresponds to the entropy created when something impossible (probability zero) becomes
mandatory (probability one).

Ref. 7

Ref. 8

Ref. 9

Mass limit

Mass plays a special role in all these arguments. The set of limits (5) allows us to extract
only the following statement on the mass of physical systems:

m > 0 .

(28)

In other words, the mass of a system is never negative. This is not a real surprise, since
negative mass is not in accordance with observations. The main point is that for general
physical systems there is no non-trivial mass limit in nature. To ﬁnd one, we have to restrict
our aim.

Ref. 10

Elementary particles

All Planck limits mentioned so far apply for all physical systems, whether they are com-
posed or elementary. Additional limits can only be found if we concentrate on elementary
systems. We saw above that in quantum theory, the distance limit is a size limit only for

Engines that accelerate against a material substrate, such as electrical engines in trains, behave only
∗ ∗ ∗∗
slightly differently. They transfer energy to the material environment. This can only happen until the gravity
from the environment keeps the engine from additional acceleration.

plies that the system size l must be smaller than any conceivable dimension:

These single particle limits, corresponding to the corrected Planck mass, energy and mo-
mentum, were already discussed in 1968 by Andrei Sakharov. They are regularly cited in
elementary particle theory. Also the temperature limit is occasionally mentioned in the lit-
erature. It corresponds to that temperature where the energy of every elementary particle is
given by the (corrected) Planck energy. Obviously, all known measurements comply with
the limits.

1, 0 or +1, in contrast to length and time, which appear also in powers

The physical observables mass, energy and momentum thus show special behaviour; they
have different limits depending on whether the system is elementary or composite. This spe-
cial behaviour is the reason that, in all physical observables, mass appears only with power
3, +2, +3
−
and others. For higher mass powers, the distinction between elementary systems and com-
posite systems would be lost. The special role of mass is also reﬂected in the fundamental
distinction between intensive and extensive quantities, a distinction that pervades the whole
of physics.

Alternative sets of principles

Instead of the three statements (5) on relativity and quantum theory, we can take other sets
of three limits from the above list as starting point, provided we take care to choose them in
such a way that they form a basis that spans all possible measurement units. For example,
a minimum distance, a minimum time interval and a maximum power in nature form such
an alternative set of principles. Together, these limits allow to deduce the speed limit, the
action limit and the force limit of nature, as you might want to check.

An often mentioned candidate set is the one formed by the Planck time, the Planck length
and the Planck mass. However, in this particular case we need more effort to show the equiv-
alence. We can indeed follow that a maximum mass implies a maximum speed. Once we
are convinced that this limit is c itself, we can rapidly deduce the maximum acceleration,
the maximum force and the maximum power. By using a practical expression for the action,

10

namely S > Pmaxt2
min/2, we get the minimum action limit. However, deriving the action ex-
pression is not obvious. We have to take carefully into account that only a single elementary
particle is being studied. The ﬁnal step is to show that the derived limits, which were valid
for a single particle only, are also valid for large systems. In other words, the often cited
candidate set consisting of minimum time, minimum length and maximum mass is not op-
timised for a presentation of the whole of modern physics. It is tuned strongly to particle
physics and arrives at general relativity only through a long detour.

Electromagnetic Planck limits

The discussion of limits can be extended to include electromagnetism. Using the (low-
energy) electromagnetic coupling constant a

tems interacting electromagnetically:

of extreme stars and black holes. The maximal electric ﬁeld plays a role in the theory

of gamma ray bursters. Also the restriction of limit values for current, conductivity and
resistance to single channels is well known in the literature. Their values and effects have
been studied extensively in the 1980s and 90s.

The observation of collective excitations in semiconductors with charge e/3 of course
does not invalidate the charge limit for physical systems. It is even possible, but by far not
certain, that the quark charge e/3 has the same origin. However, in both cases there is no
physical system with charge e/3. In the remote case that such a system appears, we would
need to make use of a certain freedom in the deﬁnition for electrical quantities. In the table,
the deﬁnition has been chosen in such a way that the Planck charge is the positron charge.
Similar measurement limits can be deduced for the conserved charges and quantum num-
bers of the other interactions. In fact, all conserved charges are built up from smallest units
in the same way as electric charge.

Paradoxes and curiosities about Planck limits

The (corrected) Planck limits are statements about properties of nature. There is no way
to measure values exceeding these limits, whatever experiment is performed. As can be
expected, such a claim provokes the search for counter-examples and leads to many para-
doxes.

The minimal angular momentum might surprise at ﬁrst, especially when we think about
spin zero particles. However, the angular momentum of the statement is total angular mo-
mentum, including the orbital part found by the observer. The total angular momentum is
never smaller than ¯h/2.

If there is a minimum length in nature, what happens to Lorentz invariance? A moving
observer should see length contraction to still smaller values. It turns out that a relative
speed so high that an observer should observe a system with a length smaller than the
Planck length implies that the observer ceases to be an observer.

If any interaction is stronger than gravity, how can the maximum force be determined
by gravity alone, which is the weakest interaction? It turns out that in situations near the
maximum force, the other interactions are negligible. This is the reason that gravity must
be included in a uniﬁed description of nature.

Is there a indeterminacy relation for capacitors of the form

where e is the positron charge, C capacity and U potential difference? Or is the relation
between electric current I and time t

correct? Both are correct, and both relations are found in the literature.

On ﬁrst sight, it seems that electric charge can be used in such a way that the acceleration
of a charged body towards a charged black hole is increased to a value exceeding the force
limit. However, the changes in the horizon for charged black holes prevent this.

Some limits are of interest if applied to the universe as a whole, such as the luminosity
limit (which, together with the age and size of the universe, explains why the sky is dark

at night) and the curvature limit (which is of importance near the big bang). The angular
rotation limit also provides a limit on the rotation of the observed matter in the sky. We do
not pursue these topics here.

It seems that most uncertainty relations are related to a minimum quantity of some sort.

This seems to be a general connection.

Are action or distance quantized like electric charge, in the sense that measured values
are always integer multiples of the minimum value? For distance, area and volume, present
research gives a negative answer. For action, no publications are is known to the author; the
question leads to heated debates among physicists. Opinion range from ‘action is always a
multiple of ¯h/2’ to ‘all values are possible’ and ‘the question makes no sense’.

The minimum area is twice the uncorrected Planck area. This means that the correct
entropy relation for black holes should be S/Smin = A/2Amin. The factor 2 replaces the
factor 4 that appears when the standard, uncorrected Planck area is used.

Ref. 8

In summary, we showed that a simple description of physics in a few statements implies
that in nature every physical observable is limited by a value near the Planck value. These
bounds are direct consequences of relativity and quantum theory. The limits provoke many
interesting Gedanken experiments. None of them leads to violations of the limits. However,
none of the limits is within experimental reach.

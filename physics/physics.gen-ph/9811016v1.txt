Abstract

In this paper we apply the dimensional analysis (D.A.) to two
cosmological models, Einstein-de Sitter and a Friedmann-Robertson-
Walker (FRW) with radiation predominance. We believe that this
method is the simplest form to solve the diﬀerential equations that
present each model and would serve as base to solve more complicated
models.

1 Introduction

In this paper we apply the dimensional analysis (D.A.) to two cosmological
models, Einstein-de Sitter and a Friedman-Robertson-Walker model (FRW)
with radiation predominance. We go to explain step by step the dimensional
method, that is to say: in section two we outline the equations, we obtain the
multiplicity of the dimensional base of each model ([1],[2]), in section three
we study the fundamental quantities, the fundamental constants and the
characteristics constants of the models and ﬁnally we apply the Pi theorem

to obtain the solution to the equations of each model. We take into account
the Barenblatt‘s criterium ([3]) to arrive to obtain the complete solution of
the equations in the second model and we justify from a dimensional point
of view the utilization of the Planck‘s system of units.

We suppose that the reader is familiarized with the models and we address
him to the classic literature to clarify the doubts, in particular Narlikar‘s book
([4]) for cosmology and ([5],[6]) and for dimensional analysis ([1],[3],[7]).

2 Multiplicity of the dimensional base.

Our three ingredients of relativistic cosmology are as follows. We use the
standard notation.

1. The cosmological principle wich leads to the Robertson-Walker line

element,

ds2 = −c2dt2 + f 2(t)

2.1 Einstein-de Sitter

The model is constituted by a perfect ﬂuid with ρm, k = 0 and p = 0. where
ρm represents the matter density that produce the bulks (masses) of all the
galaxies. Under these circumstances the ﬁeld equations remain reduced to:

(

from the ﬁrst equation (4.1), we do not obtain dimensional information. We
proceed to calculate the multiplicity of the base of this model. The range
of the matrix of the exponents of each one of the monomials is 2 as we can
prove with facility from:

The multiplicity of the dimensional base is therefore m = (number of
quantities) − (range of the matrix), in this case it is m = 3. It can be taken
as base, the base of the classical mechanics B = {f, M, t} ≈ {L, M, T } . Ob-
servation. From the equations (4) we see that the constant c does not appear
in these, this justiﬁes the utilization of the Newton‘s mechanics to study the
model. For our interest this beneﬁts us since the solution of the equations
(4) will be given by an single π−monomial.

FRW with radiation predominance.

In the second case, a universe with radiation predominance, the equations of
Friedmann remain as follows: (k = 0) we insist in to maintain the constants

ﬁnding that the multiplicity of the base for this model is 4, a possible base is:
B = {f, ρR, t, θ} ≈ {L, M, T, θ} , where θ stand for dimension of temperature.

3 Solution of the equations through D.A.

We go to calculate through dimensional analysis, applying the Pi theorem,
the radius of the Universe f (t) , the expansion speed of the galaxies v(t)
and the matter density ρ(t) that contains the Universe with radius f (t). For
this, we should know (in each model) the set of fundamental quantities1,
the universal constants and the characteristics constant that appear in the
equations. In both models, we can say that the single magnitude is t, that
represents the cosmic time ([5]).

3.1 The Einstein-de Sitter:

The fundamental quantity is t and the physical constant and characteristic
constant are G and M respectively. The rest of the quantities of the model
depends of t and the set of constants that appear in the equations of the
model, in this case {G, M} . The dimensional base of the model is B =
{L, M, T } .

3. M The total bulk (mass) of the Universe (characteristic constant of the

3.2 FRW with radiation predominance

We consider the following set of quantities and constants in this model and
the dimensional base of the model B = {L, M, T, θ}

1. t, cosmic time (fundamental quantitie in the model) [t] = T

2. c, speed of light, universal constant: [c] = LT −1

3. G, gravitational constant, universal constant: [G] = L3M −1T −2

4. a, radiation constant, universal constant: [a] = L−1M 1T −2θ−4

5. A, Characteristic constant of the model [A] = L3M 1T −2

We would like to obtain expressions to calculate the temperature θ, energy
density ρR, and ﬁnally the radius of the universe f (t) (this last magnitude
is fundamental since determine the metric and therefore the geometry of our
space - time)

In this section we go to take into account the Barenblatt‘s criterium ([3])
that permits us to formalize (between quotation marks, since always we must
be wary) the solution of the type πi = (πj)n .

3.2.1 Calculation of the temperature.

The calculation we go it to carry out by two methods. One through dimen-
sional analysis i.e. writing the matrix of the exponents and applying the Pi
theorem and other also dimensional, using the Planck‘s system of units, in
both methods we have into account the Barenblatt‘s criterium to arrive
to the solution of the problem. The dimensional base that we go to use is:

If we take into account the Barenblatt‘s criterium ([3]), then we can sup-
pose that the solution is of the form π11 = (π12)n . For this, we need to know
the orders of magnitude (magnitude range) of each one of the π−monomials2:

If we use the Planck‘s system of units, and Barenblatt‘s criterium, as we
know that all the quantities depend only on t , then the temperature will be
equal to the Planck‘s temperature by a dimensionless quantity between the
Planck‘s time and the cosmic time i.e.

The equations (5) shows us that there is no variation of entropy in the Uni-

density. We denote by entropy s and by entropy density S.

For the calculation of the entropy we act as always but in this case we do

not consider t since we know that this quantity is constant ([4],[6])

4 Conclusions.

We have shown how to apply the dimensional method to solve the diﬀeren-
tial equations that present each model. We believe that this method can be
useful to obtain solutions to equations that are presented in models more
complex. We have been very rigorous formalizing all it steps, but if is known
well a model from the physical point of view, it is not necessary be so scrupu-
lous. Without the need of developing the equations can to arrive to obtain
relationships between the quantities that form part of the model, thinking
therefore that this method has pedagogic interest.

6 Appendix.

In this short appendix we want to clarify the method followed to calculate the
multiplicity of the dimensional base, to clarify the used terms to distinguish
the quantities and constant and ﬁnally to describe succinctly as obtaining
the π−monomials making use of the Pi-Theorem. We address to the reader
to the classic literature for more details.

6.1 Multiplicity of the dimensional base.

” Dimensional Analysis can be applied to these Physical Theories whose fun-
damental laws may be written:

f (π1, ....., πn) = 0

where πi the are dimensionless products ( π−monomia)”

1. It is possible to ﬁx the multiplicity of the dimensional base.

2. The π (Buckingham) theorem may be proved an enunciated without

ambiguity

The recipe to ﬁx the multiplicity of the base is:
” The number of quantities forming the dimensional base (its multiplicity)
is given by the diﬀerence m = n − h between the total number of quantities
(including unavoidable constant) and the rank of the matrix formed with the
exponent occurring in the monomia present in the fundamental equations of
the concerned theory ”

from the ﬁrst equation (4.1), we do not obtain dimensional information. We
proceed to calculate the multiplicity of the base of this model. The range
of the matrix of the exponents of each one of the monomials is 2 as we can
prove with facility from:

The multiplicity of the dimensional base is therefore m = (number of
quantities and constants) − (range of the matrix), in this case it is m = 3.
It can be taken as dimensional base, B = {f, M, t} ≈ {L, M, T } . Another
dimensional base would be B′ = {G, L, T } and thereford all the dimensional
formulaes change with respect this base that is to say:[ρm] = G−1T −2 with
respect to B′ and with respect to B [ρm] = ML−3

6.2 Terminology

We said that t is a fundamental quantity ([1]) since the rest of the quanti-
ties, as for example f , depend on this one. The quantities as f, p etc.. are
designated them as derivatives quantities since are obtained from the funda-
mentals and from the unavoidables constants that appear in the equations of
the model. We said that G, c,a are universal constants and that M and A
are characteristics constants of each model because only appear in the equa-
tions that describe these models (as the elasticity coeﬃcients, characteristic
of each material).

The dimensional method that we follow consist thereford in: to make
a previous study of the set of fundamentals quantities that appear in each
model (in these the only one fundamental quantity that appears is t, but
in models more complex appear more fundamentals quantities) and that of
unavoidables constants, that is to say, universal and characteristic. With
these distinctions we calculate the derived quantities (f, v, θ etc...) through
the Pi-theorem and taking into account solely this type of quantities, the
fundamentals, and the unavoidables constants.

6.3 Pi Theorem

The number of independent monomia (dimensionless products) is i = n −
h where h is the rank of the matrix of the dimensional exponent of the
quantities (and unavoidable constants) relative to a suitable base.

We put as example the calculation of ρR and we show why in this case

we have take as base B′ = {L, M, T } and not B = {L, M, T, θ} .([1],[3],[7])

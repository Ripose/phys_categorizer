Abstract

In this paper, we study the exact solution of the restricted iso-
chemical model of H2 molecule with ﬁxed nuclei recently proposed
by Santilli and Shillady in which the two electrons are assumed to
be bonded/correlated into a quasiparticle called the isoelectronium.
Under the conditions that: 1) the isoelectronium is stable; 2) the
eﬀective size of the isoelectronium is ignorable, in comparison to in-
ternuclear distance; and 3) the two nuclei are at rest, the Santilli-
Shillady model of the H2 molecule is reduced to a restricted three-
body system essentially similar to a neutral version of the H +
ion,
2
which, as such, admits exact solution. Our main result is that the
restricted three-body Santilli-Shillady approach to H2 is capable to ﬁt
the experimental binding energy, at the isoelectronium mass param-
eter M = 0.308381me, although under optimal internuclear distance
about 19.6% bigger than the conventional experimental value, indi-
cating an approximate character of the three-body model.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we study isochemical model of the H2 molecule recently in-
troduced by R. M. Santilli and D. D. Shillady [1], which is characterized
by the conventional H2 model set up plus a short-range attractive Hulten
potential interaction between the two electrons originating from the deep
overlapping of their wave functions at mutual distances of the order of 1 fm;
see also [2]. If one assumes that this attractive potential is strong enough
to overcome Coloumb repulsion between the two electrons, they can form
electron-electron system called isoelectronium. The isoelectronium is char-
acterized by ”bare” mass M = 2me, as a sum of masses of two constituent
electrons, charge −2e, radius about 10−11 cm, and null magnetic moment.
The used Hulten potential contains two real parameters, one of which is the
isoelectronium correlation length parameter rc, which can be treated as an
eﬀective radius of isoelectronium.

The main structural diﬀerence between the Santilli-Shillady isochemical
model and the conventional quantum chemical model of the H2 molecule, is
that the former admits additional nonlinear, nonlocal, and nonpotential, thus
nonunitary eﬀects due to the deep overlapping of the wavepackets of valence
electrons at short distances, which are responsible for the strong molecu-
lar bond. In a ﬁrst nonrelativistic approximation, Santilli and Shillady [1]
derived the following characteristics of the isoelectronium: total rest mass
M = 2me, charge −2e, magnetic moment zero, and radius 6.84323×10−11cm.
The value M = 2me of the rest mass was derived via the assumption of a
contact, nonpotential interactions due to the mutual wave-overlapping suﬃ-
ciently strong to overcome the repulsive Coulomb force. The nonpotential
character of the bond was then responsible for the essential lack of binding
energy in the isoelectronium, and the resulting value M = 2me. However, the
authors stressed in [1] that the isoelectronium is expected to have a non-null
binding energy, and, therefore, a rest mass smaller than 2me. One argument
presented in [1] is that, when coupled in singlet at very short distances, the
two electrons eventually experience very strong attractive forces of magnetic
type, due to the two pairs of opposing magnetic polarities, resulting in a
bond. The potential origin of the bond then implies the existence of a bind-
ing energy, resulting in a rest mass of the isoelectronium smaller than 2me.
Also, in the subsequent paper [3], Santilli pointed out that the isoelectronium
can at most admit a small instability.

1

As a result of a correlation/bonding between the two electrons, Santilli
and Shillady were able to reach, for the ﬁrst time, representations of the
binding energy and other characteristics of H2 molecule which are accurate to
the seventh digit, within the framework of numerical Hartree-Fock approach
to H2 molecule viewed as a four-body system with ﬁxed nuclei, and with the
use of Gaussian screened Coloumb potential taken as an approximation to
the Hulten potential [1].

On the other hand, the above mentioned strong short-range character of
the electron-electron interaction suggests the use of approximation of sta-
ble isoelectronium of ignorably small size, in comparison to the internuclear
distance [1]. Indeed, under these two assumptions one can reduce the con-
ventional four-body structure of the H2 molecule to a three-body system (the
two electrons are viewed as a single point-like particle). Furthermore, in the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation, i.e. at ﬁxed nuclei, we have a restricted
three-body system, the Shr¨odinger equation for which admits exact analytic
solution.

So, we have the original four-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2 molecule,
and the three-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2, which is an approximation
to it. The former is characterized by, in general, unstable isoelectronium and,
thus, sensitivity to details of the electron-electron interaction, while the latter
deals with a single point-like particle (stable isoelectronium of ignorable size)
moving around two ﬁxed nuclei.

Clearly, the three-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2 molecule can be
2 ion like system. For the sake of brevity and to avoid confusion
2 ion itself, we denote H2 molecule, viewed as the restricted three-

viewed as H +
with the H +
body system, as ˆH2. Note that ˆH2 is a neutral H +

2 ion like system.

The quantum mechanical problem of the restricted H +

2 ion like systems,
associated diﬀerential equation, and its exact analytic solution have been
studied in the literature by various authors [6]-[14].

In this paper we present the exact analytic solution of the above indi-
cated restricted three-body Santilli-Shillady isochemical model of the hydro-
gen molecule, study its asymptotic behavior, and analyze the ground state
energy, presenting numerical results in the form of tables and plots. Our
analysis is based on the analytical results obtained for thoroughly studied
H +

2 ion.

In Sec. 2, we review some features of the four-body Santilli-Shillady model
of H2 necessary for our study, and introduce our separation of variables in

2

the Schr¨odinger equation under the assumption that the isoelectronium is a
stable quasiparticle of ignorable size.

In Sec. 3, we review the exact analytic solution of the H +

2 ion like systems
(which includes the ˆH2 system), and study their asymptotic behavior at large
and small distances between the two nuclei.

In Sec. 4, we use the preceding solution to ﬁnd the binding energy of
ˆH2 system. We then develop a scaling method and use Ritz’s variational
approach to check the results. Both the cases of the isoelectronium ”bare”
mass M = 2me and of variable mass parameter, M = ηme have been studied.
All the data and basic results of this Section have been collected in Table 1.
In Sec. 5, we introduce a preliminary study on the application of Ritz’s
variational approach to the general four-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2,
where the isoelectronium is an unstable composite particle, in which case
the model re-acquires its four-body structure, yet preserves a strong bond-
ing/correlation between the electrons.

In the Appendix, we present the results of our numerical calculations of
ion and of ˆH2 system, for diﬀerent values
the ground state energy of H +
2
of the isoelectronium mass parameter M, based on their respective exact
solutions, in the form of tables and plots.

Our main result is that the restricted three-body Santilli-Shillady isochem-
ical model of the hydrogen molecule does admit exact analytic solution capable
of an essentially exact representation of the binding energy, although under
internuclear distance about 19.6% bigger than the conventional experimental
value. The mass parameter M of isoelectronium has been used here to ﬁt the
experimental value of the binding energy, with the result M = 0.308381me
(i.e. about 7 times less than the ”bare” mass M = 2me). In this paper, we
assume that some defect of mass eﬀect may have place leading to decrease
of the ”bare” mass M = 2me.

We also note that the value M = 0.308381me implies a binding energy of
about 1.7 MeV, which is admittedly rather large. Recent studies by Y. Rui
[4] on the correct force law among spinning charges have indicated the exis-
tence of a critical distance below which particles with the same charge attract
each others. If conﬁrmed, these studies imply that the repulsive Coulomb
force itself between two electrons in singlet coupling can be attractive at a
suﬃciently small distance, thus eliminating the need to postulate an attrac-
tive force suﬃciently strong to overcome the repulsive Coulomb force. As a
result, a binding energy in the isoelectronium structure of the order of 1.7

3

MeV cannot be excluded on grounds of our knowledge at this time.

Clearly, however, that due to the current lack of dynamical description
of the above mentioned defect of mass, and the obtained result that the
predicted internuclear distance is about 19.6% bigger than the experimental
value, our study is insuﬃcient to conclude that the isoelectronium is perma-
nently stable, and one needs for additional study on the four-body Santilli-
Shillady isochemical model of H2, which is conducted in a subsequent paper
by one of the authors [5].

2 Santilli-Shillady model of H2 molecule

2.1 General equation

The Santilli-Shillady iso-Shr¨odinger’s equation for H2 molecule with short-
range attractive Hulten potential between the two electrons can be reduced
to the following form [1]:

where V0 and rc are positive constants, and R is distance between nuclei a
and b. By using vectors of center-of-mass system of electrons 1 and 2, ~ra and
~rb, originated at nuclei a and b, respectively, we have

(for electrons we have m1 = m2 = me). The Lagrangian of the system can

V (r12) =

and W is the potential energy of interaction between electrons and nuclei,

Notice that ˙r1 = ˙r1a = ˙r1b, and ˙r2 = ˙r2a = ˙r2b, because ~r1a = ~r1b + ~R and
~r2a = ~r2b + ~R, where ~R is constant vector. Similarly,

~ra = ~rb + ~R,

~ra =

m1 + m2
Then, Lagrangian (2.4) can be rewritten as L = L(ra, rb, r12),

m1 + m2

Here, M = m1 + m2 is the total mass of the electrons, and m = m1m2/(m1 +

~pm =

(2.9)

The system reveals axial symmetry, with the axis connecting two nuclei.
Also, for identical nuclei we have reﬂection symmetry in respect to the plane
perpendicular to the above axis and lying on equal distances from the two
nuclei.

2.2 Separation of variables

Santilli and Shillady [1] then assume that, as a particular case under study
in this paper (not to be confused with the general four-body case), the two
valence electrons of the H2 molecule can form a stable quasi-particle of small
size due to short-range attractive Hulten potential, such that

r12 ≪ ra,

r12 ≪ rb.

5

(2.10)

Therefore, we can ignore r12 in Eqs.(2.2) and (2.3),

~r1a ≈ ~r2a ≈ ~ra,

~r1b ≈ ~r2b ≈ ~rb.

(2.11)

The Hamiltonian of the system then becomes

where

In this approximation, it is possible to separate the variables ra,b and r12.

In this way, under approximation (2.10), the original four-body problem is
reduced to a three-body problem characterized by two diﬀerential equations:
1) Equation (2.16), which describes the electron-electron system forming
the bound quasi-particle state called isoelectronium, with ”bare” total mass
M = 2me and charge −2e. This equation will not be studied in this paper,
since we assume that the isoelectronium is permanently stable.
2) Equation (2.17), which is the structural equation of the restricted three-
body Santilli-Shillady isochemical model ˆH2, in which the stable isoelectro-
nium with ”bare” mass M = 2me, charge −2e, null magnetic moment and

6

ignorable size orbits around the two nuclei, hereon assumed to have inﬁnite
mass (the Born-Oppenheimer approximation).

This paper is devoted to the study of the exact analytic solution of the
latter equation, and its capability to represent the experimental data on
the binding energy, bond length, and other characteristics of the hydrogen
molecule.

3 Exact solution for H +

2 ion like system

In this Section, we present analytical solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
for H +
ion-like systems in Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we analyze
2
the associated recurrence relations, and asymptotic behavior of the solutions
at large and small distances between the two nuclei. As it was indicated
[1], this problem arises when Santilli-Shillady model of H2 is reduced to the
restricted three-body problem characterized by Eq. (2.17), which possesses
exact solution under appropriate separation of variables.

3.1 Diﬀerential equations

In Born-Oppenheimer approximation, i.e., at ﬁxed nuclei, the equation for
H +

2 ion-like system for a particle of mass M and charge q is

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

where λ is a separation constant (cf.
solutions for f and g.

3.2 Recurrence relations

By introducing the re-formulations

f → (x2 − 1)m/2f,
g → (1 − y2)m/2g,

(3.12)
to handle singularities at x = ±1 and y = ±1 in Eqs.(3.9) and (3.10),
respectively, we reach the following ﬁnal form of the equations to be solved:

(x2 − 1)f ′′ + 2(m + 1)f ′ − (λ + m(m + 1) − ˜ax − c2x2)f = 0

(3.13)

and

(1 − y2)g′′ − 2(m + 1)g′ + (λ − m(m + 1) − c2y2)g = 0,

(3.14)

8

where we have denoted

c2 =

MER2

2

,

˜a = 2MqR.

(3.15)

We shall look for solutions in the form of power series. Substituting the
power series

into Eqs. (3.13) and (3.14), we obtain the recurrence relations,

f = X fkxk,
g = X gkyk,

c2fn−2 + ˜afn−1 − (λ − (m + n)(m + n + 1))fn

−(n + 1)(n + 2)fn+2 = 0

and

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

c2gn−2 − (λ − (m + n)(m + n + 1))gn − (n + 1)(n + 2)gn+2 = 0,

(3.19)

from which coeﬃcients fk and gk must be found. Here, f0 and g0 are ﬁxed by
normalization of the general solution. Note that the recurrence relation (3.18)
contains term 2MqRfn−1 raised from the linear term 2MqRx in Eq.(3.9).

In the next two Sections we consider some particular cases of interest
prior to going into details of the general solution. These particular solutions
are important for the study of the general case.

3.3 The particular case R = 0

In the particular case R = 0, the two nuclei are superimposed, so that the
system is reduced to a helium-like system,

(3.21)

From recurrence relations (3.18) and (3.19) we obtain the following particular
recurrence sequences,

(λ − (m + n)(m + n + 1))fn − (n + 1)(n + 2)fn+2 = 0

(3.22)

9

and

(λ − (m + n)(m + n + 1))gn − (n + 1)(n + 2)gn+2 = 0,

(3.23)

which are equivalent to each other, and can be stopped by putting the sepa-
ration constant

(3.24)
with m = −l, . . . , l. This gives us well known solution for g in terms of
Legendre polynomials,

λ = (m + n)(m + n + 1) = l(l + 1),

(3.25)

(3.26)

(3.27)

(3.28)

where m = |m|, and

g = (1 − y2)m/2 d

dym Pl(y),

Pl =

2ll!

dl
dyl (y2 − 1)l.

The solution is the well known spherical harmonic function

Ylm = NlmP m

l (y)eimϕ,

with normalization constant

Nlm = vuut

(l − m)!(2l + 1)

(l + m)!4π

.

This solution corresponds to the case of an ellipsoid degenerated into a sphere,
and we can put y = cos θ for identiﬁcation with the angular spherical coordi-
nates (θ, ϕ). Equation in x corresponds to the radial part of the well known
solution expressed in terms of Laguerre polynomials.

3.4 The particular case q = 0

In the particular case of zero charge, q = 0, we have from Eqs.(3.9) and
(3.10)

(3.29)

(3.30)

One can see that these equations originate straightforwardly also from the
standard wave equation ∇2ψ+k2ψ = 0, in the spheroidal coordinates (x, y, ϕ).
Recurrence relations (3.18) and (3.19) then become

c2fn−2 − (λ − (m + n)(m + n + 1))fn − (n + 1)(n + 2)fn+2 = 0

(3.31)

and

c2gn−2 − (λ − (m + n)(m + n + 1))gn − (n + 1)(n + 2)gn+2 = 0,

(3.32)

which are equivalent to each other.

3.5 The general case

In this Section, we consider the general solution of our basic equations (3.9)
and (3.10). To have more general set up, we consider the case of diﬀerent
charges of nuclei, Z1 and Z2. This leads to appearance of additional linear in
y term in Eq.(3.10), so that both the ordinary diﬀerential equations become
of similar structure. Also, we restrict consideration by analyzing discrete
spectrum, i.e. we assume that the energy E < 0.

Let us denote

p =

R
2

√−2E,

a = R(Z2 + Z1),

b = R(Z2 − Z1).

(3.50)

Then, Eqs.(3.9) and (3.10), for the general case of diﬀerent charges of nuclei,
can be written as

where we assume that the solutions obey

fmk(p, a; x) = 0,

|gmq(p, b;±1)| < ∞.

(3.53)

The eigenvalues λ in Eqs.(3.51) and (3.52) should be equal to each other,

λ(x)
mk(p, a) = λ(y)

mq(p, b).

(3.54)

The general solution ψ(x, y, ϕ) of Eq.(3.6) is represented in the following
factorized form:

ψkqm(x, y, ϕ; R) = Nkqm(p, a, b)fmk(p, a; x)gmq(p, b; y)

exp(±imϕ)

√2π

.

(3.55)

The normalization coeﬃcients Nkqm(p, a, b) in Eq.(3.55) are represented with
the help of derivatives of the eigenvalues, λ(x)

mq(p, b), namely,

N 2

kqm(p, a, b) =

For a given indices k, q, m, and ﬁxed values of Z1, Z2, and R, the discrete
energy spectrum E can be determined from Eq.(3.54). This equation has
unique solution, p = pkqm(a, b). Then, by solving the relation stemming from
(3.50)

pkqm(R(Z2 + Z1), R(Z2 − Z1)) =

R
2

√−2E

in respect to E, we can ﬁnd the discrete spectrum of energy,

Ej(R) = Ekqm(R, Z1, Z2).

(3.57)

(3.58)

Number of zeroes, k, q, and m, of the functions g(y), f (x), and exp ±imϕ are
the angular, radial and azimuthal quantum numbers, respectively. However,
instead of k, q, and m one can use their linear combinations, namely, N =
k + q + m + 1 is main quantum number and l = q + m is orbital quantum
number.

To construct the general solution u(z), which is called Coloumb spheroidal
function [8] (csf), in terms of angular csf g(y) and radial csf f (x), let us,
again, use the form which accounts for singularities at the points z = ±1 and
z = ∞,
(3.59)

u(z) = (1 − z2)m/2 exp[−p(1 ± z)]v(z).

Then, we represent v(z) as an expansion,

v(z) =

∞

Xs=0

as(p, b, λ)ws(z),

(3.60)

14

in some set of basis functions ws(z).

Now, the complexity of the recurrence relations depends on the basis. In
the preceding sections, where the particular cases, R = 0 and q = 0, have
been considered, we used a power series representation. One can try other
forms of the representation as well. For a good choice of the basis functions
ws(z), we can obtain three-term recurrence relation of the form

αsas+1 − βsas + γsas−1 = 0,

(3.61)

where αs, βs, and γs are some polynomials in p, b, and λ. Then, using the
tridiagonal matrix ˆA consisting of the coeﬃcients αs, βs, and γs entering
Eq.(3.61), we can write down the equation to ﬁnd out eigenvalues λ(x)
mk(p, a)
and λ(y)

mq(p, b). Namely,

det ˆA = F (p, b, λ) = 0.

(3.62)

The matrix ˆA has a tridiagonal form. This leads directly to one-to-one cor-
respondence between det ˆA and the inﬁnite chain fraction,

F (p, b, λ) = β0 −

(3.63)
In numerical computations, this relation allows one to ﬁnd out eigenvalues
λ in an easier way due to simpler algorithm provided by the chain fraction.
Consequently, one can compute the energy and coeﬃcients as of the expan-
sion of eigenfunctions g(y) and f (x) by using the chain fraction.

The result of this approach in constructing of the solutions depends on the
convergence of the chain fraction. Analysis of the convergence can be made
from a general point of view. Suﬃcient conditions of the convergence of the
chain (3.63), and of the expansion (3.60), are the following two relations:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Particularly, when as+1/as → 0 at s → ∞ the series (3.60) converges at any

(ii) For the choice of basis function vs(z) in the form of orthogonal poly-

nomials, the suﬃcient condition for convergence of Fourier series (3.60) is

(3.66)

Below, we consider separately angular and radial csf entering the general
solution.

3.5.1 The angular Coloumb spheroidal function

For the angular Coloumb spheroidal function (acsf), it is natural to choose
the basis functions vs(y) in the form of associated Legendre polynomials,
P m
s+m(y). Indeed, they form complete system in the region y ∈ [−1, 1], and
reproduce acsf at p = b = 0 (see Sec. 3.3). Inserting of the expansion

gmq(p, b; y) =

csP m

s+m(y)

∞

Xs=0

(3.67)

into Eq.(3.52) entails ﬁve-term recurrence relation. However, this relation,
which is sometimes used, is not so suitable as the three-term relation. This
is because the determinant of the corresponding pentadiagonal matrix can
not be represented as a chain fraction. Nevertheless, in the case b = 0, i.e.
for Z1 = Z2, this ﬁve-terms recurrence relation is reduced to two three-terms
recurrence relations, separately for even (c−2 = 0, c0 = 1) and odd (c−1 = 0,
c1 = 1) solutions of Eq.(3.52) presented in previous Section.

For the general case b 6= 0, the expansions of g(p, b; y), handling singular-
ities at the points y = ±1 and y = ∞, respectively, as considered by Baber
and Hasse [9], are

gmq(p, b; y) = exp[−p(1 + y)]

s+m(y),

(3.69)

These expansions yield three-terms recurrence relation,

ρscs+1 − κscs + δscs−1 = 0,

c−1 = 0,

(3.70)

where the coeﬃcients for the case of expansion (3.68) have the following form:

ρs =

(s + 2m + 1)[b − 2p(s + m + 1)]

2(s + m) + 3

,

κs = (s + m)(s + m + 1) − λ,

(3.71)

δs =

s[b + 2p(s + m)]
2(s + m) − 1

.

To estimate convergence of these expansions, one can use the above made
estimation of the convergence, with the following replacements: αs → ρs,
βs → κs, γs → δs, and as → cs. For the expansion (3.79) we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ρs−1δs

κs−1κs(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s→∞ ∼ (cid:18)p
s(cid:19)2

,

(3.72)

i.e., at p > 1, convergence takes place only at s > 2p. We should take into
account this condition when choosing minimal number of terms in the chain
fraction (3.73) which is suﬃcient to calculate λ, to a required accuracy.

The recurrence relation for the coeﬃcients c′

s of the expansion (3.69)
diﬀers from that of Eq.(3.70) by the replacement p → −p in formulas (3.71).
Clearly, this replacement does not change the form of the chain fraction,

F (y)(p, b, λ) = κ0 −

ρ0δ1
κ1−

ρ1δ2

κ2− · · ·

(3.73)

So, in both the cases, (3.68) and (3.69), the eigenvalues λ can be found from
one and the same equation,

F (y)(p, b, λ) = 0.

(3.74)

In practical calculations with the help of this algorithm, the inﬁnite chain
fraction (3.63) is, of course, replaced by the ﬁnite one, F (y)
N +1(p, b, λ), in which

17

one retains a suﬃciently big number N of terms. Typically, N > 10 provides
very good accuracy. So, the eigenvalues are computed as the roots of the
polynomial QN +1(p, b, λ) of degree N + 1, namely,

F (y)

N +1(p, b, λ) =

QN +1(p, b, λ)
PN +1(p, b, λ)

.

(3.75)

Such a representation allows one to exclude singularities, associated to zeroes
of the polynomial PN +1(p, b, λ), from Eq.(3.74). Further, from the deﬁnitions
(3.63) and (3.75) we obtain the following recurrence relation for the polyno-
mial Qk(p, b, λ):

Qk+1 = Qk ¯κN −k − Qk−1 ¯ρN −k ¯δN −k+1, Q−1 = 0, Q0 = 1,

(3.76)

with the use of which one can ﬁnd QN +1. Here, the coeﬃcients ¯κs, ¯ρs, and ¯δs
diﬀer from that of Eq.(3.71) by the factor (1 + κ2
s)−1/2. This factor does not
change the recurrence relation (3.70). However, it makes possible to avoid
accumulating of big numbers at intermediate computations.
Indeed, from
Eq.(3.71) for κs it follows that the leading coeﬃcients of the polynomials
Qk would behave as k4k, for example, for k = 4 we would have 416, if we
would not made the above mentioned renormalization of the coeﬃcients ρs,
κs, and δs. The eigenvalue is found as an appropriate root of the polynomial
QN +1(p, b, λ(y)). Clearly, for big N, there is no way to represent in general the
roots of QN +1 analytically so one is forced to use numerical computations.

In the numerical computations, to pick up the appropriate eigenvalue
λ(y)
mq(p, b) among N + 1 roots of the polynomial QN +1 it is necessary to choose
some starting value of λ. For example, one can put the starting value at the
point p = b = 0, where λ(y)
mq(0, 0) = (q + m)(q + m + 1). The ﬁrst step is to
increase discretely p → p + ∆p and b → b + ∆b beginning from the starting
point p = b = 0, at ﬁxed values of m and q, and the second step is to ﬁnd
λ(y)
mq(p + ∆p, b + ∆b) with the help of Eq.(3.74). Repeating these steps one
can ﬁnd λ(y)
mq numerically as a function of p and b in some interval of interest.
Also, asymptotics of λ which will be studied in Sec. 3.6 are of much help
here to choose the appropriate root. For example, for b = 0 and N = 5 we
obtain numerically from the determinant of the tridiagonal matrix consist-
ing of the coeﬃcients deﬁned by Eq.(3.71), with −κs on the main digonal,
and ρs and δs on the upper and lower adjacent diagonals respectively, the

18

polynomial,
det ˆA = 0.003λ6−0.2λ5+(0.2p2+5.5)λ4−(6.3p2+56)λ3+(1.5p4+66p2+231)λ2
(3.77)

−(19p4 + 226p2 + 277)λ + p6 + 44p4 + 186p2.

Only one of its six roots has asymptotics,

λ|p→0 = 0.667p2 − 0.0148p4 + O(p5),

(3.78)

which reproduces, to a good accuracy, the asymptotics (3.124). So, this is
the desired root to be used in subsequent calculations. Also, observe the
decrease of the numerical coeﬃcients at higher degrees of λ which control
the convergence.

Note that, at p ≫ 1, the acsf is concentrated around the points y = ±1
so that expansion (3.68) converges slowly. In this case one uses another, more
appropriate, expansions,

∞

gmq(p, b; y) = (1 − y2)m/2 exp[−p(1 + y)]

gmq(p, b; y) = (1 − y2)m/2 exp[−p(1 − y)]

cs(1 + y)s,

(3.79)

s(1 − y)s.

Evidently, expansion (3.79) converges faster in the region [−1, 0] while the
expansion (3.80) converges faster in the region [0, 1]. Here, the coeﬃcients cs
of the expansion (3.79) obey the three-term recurrence sequence (3.70), with

ρs = 2(s + 1)(s + m + 1),

κs = s(s + 1) + (2s + m + 1)(2p + m) + b − λ,

δs = b + 2p(s + m).

(3.81)

It is remarkable to note that expansions (3.79) and (3.80) converge at any y,
and the corresponding chain fractions (3.63) converge at any p since

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

In practical calculations, one can use a combination of expansions (3.68)
and (3.79). Namely, the procedure is: from expansion (3.68) one ﬁnds eigen-
values while the eigenfunctions are calculated from to Eq.(3.79). Of course,
both solutions (3.79) and (3.80) should be sewed, for example, at the point
y = 0, because the recurrence relations do not determine, in this case, a
general normalization of the coeﬃcients cs and c′
s. Particularly, the sewing
condition, which deﬁnes the normalization of cs and c′

s, has the form

Xs=0

cs = Xs=0

c′
s.

(3.83)

To derive the asymptotics of acsf and its eigenvalues we can use an

expansion in Laguerre polynomials,

3.5.2 The radial Coloumb spheroidal function

The radial Coloumb spheroidal function (rcsf) obviously should be written
in a form suitable to handle singularities at the points x = 1 and x = ∞,
namely,
(3.88)

fmk(p, a; x) = (1 − x2)m/2 exp[−p(x − 1)]f (x).

So, the equation for f (x) takes the form

(x2−1)f ′′(x)+[−2p(x2−1)+2(m+1)x]f ′(x)+[−λ+m(m+1)+2pσx]f (x) = 0,
(3.89)
where we have denoted σ = a
2p − (m + 1). In the case when the expansion
f (x) = Xs=0
(3.90)

asus(x)

implies a three-terms recurrence relation, the eigenvalues λ(x)
found from the chain fraction equation,

mk(p, a) can be

F (x)(p, a; λ) = 0.

(3.91)

Also, the expansion which is of practical use has been considered by Jaﬀe
[10]. In this case, the expansion series (3.90) becomes

f (x) = (x + 1)σXs=0

asχs,

(3.92)

where χ = (x − 1)/(x + 1) is Jaﬀe’s variable. By inserting (3.92) into the
equation for the function f (x), we get recurrence relation (3.61), where the
coeﬃcients are

αs = (s + 1)(s + m + 1),

βs = 2s2 + (2s + m + 1)(2p − σ) − a − m(m + 1) + λ =
= 2s(s + 2p − σ) − (m + σ)(m + 1) − 2pσ + λ,

γs = (s − 1 − σ)(s − m − 1 − σ).

Also, for Jaﬀe series expansion, we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

αs−1γs

βs−1βs(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s→∞

21

(3.93)

(3.94)

i.e., the chain fraction converges at p > 0. One can see also that the Jaﬀe
expansion converges at any x.

In addition, the function f (x) can be expanded in associated Laguerre

polynomials,

f (x) = (x + 1)σ

∞

Xs=0

asLm

s+m(¯x),

¯x = 2p(x − 1).

(3.95)

In this case,the recurrence relation is of three-terms form, and the coeﬃcients
are

αs = −(s + m + 1)" a

2p − (s + 1)# = (s + m + 1)(s − m − σ),

βs = −(2s + m + 1)" a
2p − (s + m + 1)# +
+2p(2s + m + 1) − (s + m)(m + 1) − a + λ,
2p − (s + m)# = s(s − 1 − σ).
γs = −s" a

(3.96)

As to numerical computation of the eigenvalues λ(x), expansions (3.92) and
(3.95) are equivalent because the chain fraction depends, in fact, only on βs
and αsγs+1. Indeed, by comparing Eq.(3.93) and Eq.(3.96), one can easily
see that in both cases βs and αsγs+1 are the same. Evidently, it then follows
that the associated chain fractions are equivalent to each other.

However, we should note that Jaﬀe’s recurrence sequence, in general, is
more stable, while Laguerre expansion (3.95) is more suitable to ﬁnd out the
asymptotics of fmk(p, a; x).

Also, we note that the associated ”radial” polynomials QN +1, the root
λ(x)(p, a) of which should be found, contain a much bigger number of terms, in
comparison to the ”angular” case. So, practically ﬁnding of radial eigenvalues
is much harder than that of angular eigenvalues.

At equal charges of nuclei, Z1 = Z2, the equation for g, and the recurrence
relation for gk, are the same as they are in the particular case q = 0 considered
in Sec. 3.4. A general solution for g is then given by acsf (3.38) and (3.39),
with coeﬃcients dmn

given by recurrence relation (3.40).

In the reminder of this Section we would like to note that, in general,
solving the recurrence relations can be made equivalent to solving associated

22

ordinary diﬀerential equations by making the z transform. In many cases
the z transform helps to solve recurrence relations. Namely, one deﬁnes the
function

Z(z) =

zn

∞

Xs=0

associated to the coeﬃcients as entering Eq.(3.61) viewed as a function of
discrete variable s. For αs, βs, and γs given by Eq.(3.93) we obtain from
Eq.(3.61)

where we have denoted

−m(m − τ + 1)c0z = 0,

τ =

If one has solved these diﬀerential equations for Z(z) and Y (z), then, by
making the inverse z transform, one can ﬁnd the expansion coeﬃcients as
and cs (and thus the general solution of the problem).

3.6 Asymptotics of csf and their eigenvalues

To analyze the exact solution, which is of rather complicated nonclosed form
(inﬁnite series) given in the previous Sections, it is much instructive to derive
its asymptotics, which can be represented in a closed form. In this Section,
we present the asymptotics at large (R → ∞) and small (R → 0) distances

Let us consider the asymptotic expansion of acsf. In this case, the equation

Here, the solution is constructed in two overlapping intervals, D− = [−1, y1]
and D+ = [y2, 1], with y2 < y1. Then, the asymptotics of acsf gmq(p, 2pβ; y)

Now, let us consider the asymptotic expansion of rcsf. The replacements
x → −y, p → −p, α → −β convert the radial equation around the point x =
1 to the angular equation around the point y = −1. Thus, the corresponding
asymptotics of rcsf are directly related to the above found asymptotics of
acsf.

The rcsf, normalized to the ﬁrst order in p, has the form

Since the ﬁrst index of Whittaker function in Eq.(3.108) is κ = k +(m+1)/2,
the function can be expressed in terms of Laguerre polynomials.

Energy at R → ∞.

In the limit R → ∞, the Coloumb two-center problem is evidently reduced to
two separate problems of Coloumb centers, with the charges Z1 and Z2. Each
of the atoms, eZ1 and eZ2, is characterized by a set of parabolic quantum
numbers, [n, n1, n2, m] and [n′, n′
2, m], which are related to each other by
the relations

1, n′

n = n1 + n2 + m + 1, n′ = n′

The number k of zeroes of rcsf coincides with the number n1, for the angular
functions of the left center, eZ1, and with the number n′
1, for the angular
functions of the right center, eZ2.

Eq.(3.110) gives the multipole expansion in the electrostatic energy of the
interaction between the atom eZ1 and the far-distant charge Z2 (so called
eZ1-terms).

Note that expansion (3.110) can be obtained by ordinary perturbation
techniques as well. Indeed, the degrees of Z1 display the orders of the mul-
tipole moment of the atom eZ1.

The series of terms corresponding to the other atom, eZ2, is obtained
from Eq.(3.110) with the use of self-evident replacements, Z1 ↔ Z2, n → n′,
∆ → ∆′, and n2 → n′
2.
Finally, the energy of the ground state 1sσg of the molecular ion, for which

Eq.(3.121) obtained by the second-order perturbation is of less accuracy. A
practically achieved accuracy of the ﬁrst-order perturbation (3.120) and of
Eq.(3.130) is the same; at ZR < 0.1, the discrepancy is not bigger than 1%,
and becomes sharply smaller with the increase of the parameter ZR.

up to O(l−2). Clearly, an accuracy of the quasiclassical Eqs.(3.131)-(3.135)
becomes higher for a greater number of zeroes of the solutions, k and q.
However, even for the ground state, k = q = m = 0, these equations give
a good approximation for the energy in both limiting cases, R → 0 and
R → ∞. Also, we note that corresponding numerical calculations showed
that for the intermediate values of R the terms Ej(R) can be determined
within the quasiclassical approach with accuracy of about 5%, or more [11].

The angular and radial eigenvalues λ are found as solutions of the equa-
tions containing inﬁnite chain fractions presented in previous Sections which
should be interrupted and then solved numerically, to a required accuracy.
Our primary interest is the study of Santilli-Shillady model ˆH2 system.
2 ion as well to check our calculations

However, we present the results for H +
and to use them in the scaling method described below.

Also, the reader should keep in mind that we are primarily interested in
ascertaining whether there exist a non-zero value of R for which a fully stable
and point-like isoelectronium permits an exact representation of the binding
energy of H2 molecule.

It should be noted that the ground state electronic energy is obtained
as a function of the parameter R due to Eq.(3.58). By adding to it the
internuclear potential energy 1/R, we obtain the total ground state energy of
the system, so that at some value R = Rmin, the total energy E necessarily
has a minimum, if the system is stable. This is the way to determine uniquely
the internuclear distance under an exact representation of the total energy
E.

To have an independent check of the result for the total ground state en-
ergy of ˆH2 (with the stable and point-like isoelectronium) obtaining from the
exact solution, we develop a scaling method based on the original Schr¨odinger
equation for H +
2 ion like system. Namely, it appears that one is able to cal-
culate the ground state energy as a function of R for any H +
2 ion like system
with equal charges of nuclei, Z1 = Z2, provided that one knows the ground
state energy as a function of R for the H +
2 ion itself. It should be pointed out
that the scaling method does not depend on the obtained solution because
it reﬂects, in fact, the scaling properties of the Schr¨odinger equation itself.

In addition, we use below Ritz’s variational approach to H +

2 like systems
to ﬁnd out the approximate value of the ground state energy of ˆH2, as well
as to check the result provided by the exact solution, and to demonstrate the
accuracy of the variational approximation.

Our general remark is that in both approaches, the exact solution and
Ritz’s variational solution, we use Born-Oppenheimer approximation (ﬁxed
nuclei). Clearly, taking into account the ﬁrst order correction, i.e., zero
harmonic oscillations of the nuclei in H2 around their equilibrium positions,
we achieve greater accuracy.

But we still have a signiﬁcant inaccuracy in the value of dissociation
energy due to the fact that H2 system has the lightest possible nuclei (two

31

single protons).

To estimate this inaccuracy, one can invoke Morse’s potential customarily
used for diatomic molecules. In particular, the analysis for H2 molecule shows
that the ground state energy of harmonic oscillations of the nuclei receives
1.4% correction due to the ﬁrst anharmonic term.

4.1 Exact representation of binding energies of H +

2 ion

and three-body ˆH2 system

The csf based computations for H +
ion were presented, for example, by
2
Teller [12], Bates et al. [13], and Wind [14], and we do not repeat this study
here for brevity, while we shall just describe the procedure and present our
ﬁnal numerical results in Appendix, Table 2.

In particular, Teller presented a plot of the resulting function E1sσ(R)
which provides a good accuracy, and Wind used the exact solution to present
a table of energy values in seven decimal places for distance values of R up to
20 a.u. in steps of 0.05 a.u. However, these results cannot be used directly in
our case since the repulsive potential between the nuclei, 1/R, has not been
accounted for, and, as the main reason, we have the isoelectronium instead
of one single electron.

In the Appendix, we present the results obtained from the csf based
recurrence relations by numerical calculations for ordinary H +
ion and for
2
ˆH2 system, at M = 2me. These results are presented in Tables 2 and 4.
Tables 3 and 5 have been derived from Tables 2 and 4, respectively, by
simple adding internuclear potential energy 1/R, to obtain the total energy
of the system.

In Table 2, we present the 1sσg electronic term of H +

2 . In Table 3, we
2 . In Table 4, we present the 1sσg term of ˆH2,
present the total energy of H +
at the mass M = 2me. In Table 5, we present the total energy of ˆH2, at the
mass M = 2me. Also, in Table 6, we present the total minimal energies of
ˆH2 and optimal distances R, for various values of the isoelectronium mass
parameter, M = ηme. All the data of these Tables are purely theoretical
and, additionally, we plot them in Figures 1–8, for the reader convenience.
Figures 6 and 8 give more detailed view on the interval 0.26 < η < 0.34.

The analysis of the data in Tables 2–5 is simple. Namely, one should iden-
tify the minimal value of the energy in each Table. One can use Figures 1–4

32

for visual identiﬁcation of the minima, and then turn to the corresponding
Tables 2–5, to reach a higher numerical accuracy.

Let us consider, as an example, Table 2. One can see that the energy

minimum for H +

2 is

E1sσ = −2.0 a.u. at R = 0 a.u.

(4.1)

Note that E1sσ is the electronic energy, i.e. the internuclear repulsion has
not been taken into account here. Our remark is that this energy value
corresponds to He+ ion due to the fact that two H +
2 nuclei are superimposed
and form He nucleous at R = 0.

Let us consider now Table 3. In this Table, one can ﬁnd the line |2.0 | −
0.602634| corresponding to visual minimal value of the energy. To identify a
more precise value of the minimal energy, one should use the interpolation of
the data. This gives us the minimum of the total energy of H +
2 ,

E = −0.6026346 a.u. at R = 1.9971579 a.u.

(4.2)

2 ] = −0.6017 a.u. [15] for H +

This theoretical value represents rather accurately the known experimental
value Eexper[H +
2 ion, thus establishing the valid-
ity of our csf based calculations. For completeness, we note that the experi-
mental dissociation energy of H +
2 ] ≃ 0.0974 a.u. = 2.65 eV,
and the internuclear distance Rexper[H +
Let us now consider Table 4. One can see that the energy minimum for

2 ion is Dexper[H +

2 ] ≃ 2.00 a.u. = 1.0584˚A.

ˆH2, at M = 2me, is

E1sσ = −16.0 a.u. at R = 0 a.u.

(4.3)

Note that E1sσ only yields the isoelectronium’s energy, i.e. the internuclear
repulsion has not been taken into account here. Our remark is that this
energy value corresponds to the He atom, where the two electrons form a
stable point-like isoelectronium of mass M = 2me.

Let us consider now Table 5 which is of striking interest for our study.
In this Table, one can ﬁnd the line |0.250 | − 7.61428940411169996| cor-
responding to the visual minimal value of the energy. To identify a more
precise value of the minimal energy, one should use the interpolation of the
data given in this Table. This gives us the minimum of the total energy of
ˆH2,

E = −7.617041 a.u. at R = 0.258399 a.u.

(4.4)

33

This theoretical value is in quite good agreement with the preceding the-
oretical result by Santilli and Shillady obtained via structurally diﬀerent
variational numerical method, Evar = −7.61509174 at Rvar = 0.2592 (see
third column of Table 1 in Ref.[1]). It is quite naturally to observe that this
variational energy is a bit higher (by 0.002 a.u.) than the above one obtained
from the exact solution (as it is expected to be for any variational solution).
However, this exact theoretical value (4.4) does not meet the experimental
value Eexper[H2] = −1.17 a.u. [15] known for H2 molecule. Indeed, adopted
approximation that the isoelectronium is point-like, stable, and has mass
M = 2me leads us to the theoretical value (4.4) while the known experimental
value, Eexper[H2] = −1.17 a.u., diﬀers much from it.
Essentially the same conclusion is due to numerical program SASLOBE
by Santilli and Shillady [1], where Gaussian screened Coloumb potential in-
teraction between the electrons, rather than the stable point-like isoelec-
tronium approximation, has been used to achieve ﬁnal precise ﬁt of E =
−1.174474 a.u., with the obtained bond length R = 1.4011 a.u., at the iso-
electronium correlation length rc = 0.01125 a.u. (see Table 1 in Ref.[1]). We
discuss on this issue in Sec. 5.

Our remark is that, due to Table 5, the experimental value E = −1.17 a.u.
is ﬁtted by the distance R = 0.072370 a.u. However, this energy value is
not minimal and thus can not be ascribed reasonable physical treatment in
Table 5.

Our conclusion from the above analysis is that we have two main possi-
bilities to overcome this sharp discrepancy between our theoretical and the
experimental binding energy values which has place at M = 2me:

1. Consider unstable isoelectronium, i.e. the four-body Santilli-Shillady

model of H2 molecule;

2. Treat the mass M of isoelectronium as a free parameter, instead of
ﬁxing it to M = 2me, assuming thus some defect of mass discussed in
Introduction,

in order to ﬁt the experimental data on H2 molecule.

The ﬁrst possibility will be considered in a subsequent paper because it
needs in application of diﬀerent technique, while the second possibility can
be studied within the three-body Santilli-Shillady model under consideration
to which we turn below.

34

In the next Section, we develop simple formalism allowing one to deal with
the mass and charge of isoelectronium viewed as free parameters, and arrive
at the conclusion (see Table 6) that the restricted three-body Santilli-Shillady
model of H2 molecule is capable to ﬁt the experimental binding energy, with
the total mass of isoelectronium equal to M = 0.308381me, although with
the internuclear distance about 19.6% bigger than the experimental value.

4.2 The scaling method

In order to relate the characteristics of H +
2 ion like system to that of thor-
oughly studied H +
2 ion, we develop scaling method based on the Schr¨odinger
equation. The neutral ˆH2 system with stable point-like isoelectronium is an
example of H +
2 ion like system in which we are particularly interested here.
Below, we develop scaling method for the case of arbitrary mass and charge
of the particle.

Let us write the Schr¨odinger equation for a particle of the rescaled charge

e → −ζe,

(4.5)

(we turn here from e = −1 to −e = 1 representation), and the rescaled mass
(4.6)

with equal charges of nuclei, +eZ1 = +eZ2 = +eZ,

where η and ζ are scaling parameters, and Rab is distance between the nuclei.
The condition Z1 = Z2 is an essential point to stress here because owing to
which we can successfully develop the scaling method. We introduce the unit
of length,

We introduce dimensionless entities ρ = r/r0, ρa = ra/r0, ρb = rb/r0, and
R = Rab/r0. Then, Laplacian in Eq.(4.9) becomes r2

which identically coincides with the original Eq.(4.13). The diﬀerence is that
Eq.(4.14) is treated in terms of the rescaled units, r0(η, ζ, Z) and E0(η, ζ, Z),
instead of the ordinary Bohr’s units, rB and EB. As the result, we have one
and the same form of Schr¨odinger equation for any H +
2 like system charac-
terized by equal charges of nuclei. This makes a general ground to calculate
some characteristic entity of any H +
2 like system when one knows its value
for H +

2 ion.

(4.15)

we can establish the following relationship between the distances correspond-
ing to arbitrary ZζZ system and H +

2 ion,

Rab =

.

(4.16)

It is remarkable to note that the dependence on Z disappeared in Eq.(4.16).
In the case of isoelectronium of mass M = 2me and charge −2e, we have
η = 2 and ζ = 2, so that

Rab =

(4.17)

Also, the energy E(R) of ZζZ system and energy ε(R) of H +
to each other according to the equation,

2 ion are related

E(R) = ηζ 2Z 2  mee4

¯h2 ! ε(R).

(4.18)

4.2.1 The case M = 2me
So, in the case of isoelectronium of mass M = 2me and charge −2e, we get
(4.19)

E(Rab) = 8ε(R).

Note however that the factor ζ/Z = 2 arised due to R = (ζ/Z)R is hidden
here so that in order to calculate the values of E(Rab) and Rab from ε(R)
and R respectively one should multiply ε by 8 and R by 1/4.

As the result, in accordance with the scaling method the points can be

calculated due to the following rule:

(R, E) → (R, E + 1/R) → (R/4, 8E) → (R/4, 8E + 4/R),

(4.20)

for Tables 2 → 3 → 4 → 5. One can easily check numerically that these prop-
erties indeed hold true for the presented Tables. Thus, the scaling method

37

can be used instead of the independent numerical calculations for ˆH2 system
if one has the data for H +

2 ion.

It is highly important to note here that the energy minimum in Table 3 is
not rescaled to the energy minimum in Table 5 due to the absence of energy
scaling between these Tables; see Eq.(4.20), from which one can observe that
(8E + 4/R) can not be expressed as n(E + 1/R), where n is a number. So
one needs to identify minimum in Table 5 independently (after calculating
all the points), rather than direct rescale the minimum from Table 3 to try
to get minimum for Table 5.

4.2.2 The case M = ηme
For a more general case of isoelectronium mass, M = ηme, and charge −2e,
we should keep the following sequence of calculations:

(R, E) → (R, E + 1/R) → (

R
2η

, 4ηE) → (

R
2η

, 4ηE +

2η
R

).

(4.21)

starting from Table 2 to obtain, at the last step, the table of values (similar to
Table 5) from which we should extract a minimal value of the energy and the
corresponding optimal distance, at each given value of mass η. The result of
the analysis of a big number of such tables is collected in Table 6, where the
interval 0.26 < η < 0.34 appears to be of interest; M = η, in atomic units.
Plots of the data of Table 6 are presented in Figures 5 and 7 (Figures 6 and
8 give more detailed view on the interval of interest) show that

Emin(M) ≃ −3.808M,

Ropt(M) ≃

0.517

M

,

(4.22)

to a good accuracy. Note that Emin(M) unboundedly decreases with the
increase of M (there is no local minimum), so we can use a ﬁt, instead of the
minimization in respect with M. From this Table, we obtain the following
ﬁnal ﬁt of the binding energy for the restricted three-body Santilli-Shillady
model of H2 molecule:

M = 0.308381me, E = −1.174475 a.u., R = 1.675828 a.u.,

(4.23)

where the mass parameter M of the isoelectronium has been varied in order to
meet the experimental energy Eexper[H2] = −1.174474 a.u. = −31.9598 eV.

38

Using this value of mass, M = 0.308381me, we computed the total energy
as a function of the internuclear distance R, and depicted it in Figure 9 to
illustrate that R = 1.675828 a.u. indeed corresponds to a minimal value of
the energy. Note that the predicted optimal distance R = 1.675828 a.u. =
0.886810˚A appears to be about 19.6% bigger than the conventional experi-
mental value Rexper[H2] = 1.4011 a.u. = 0.742˚A.

This rather big (19.6%) discrepancy can not be ascribed to the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation used in this paper since it gives relatively small
uncertainty in the energy value, even in the case of H2 molecule. We stress
here that in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the three-body problem
(the Schr¨odinger equation) can be given exact solution owing to separation
of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom while the full three-body
problem (accounting for the wave functions of the nuclei, etc.) can not be
solved exactly.

In a strict consideration, we should calculate the dissociation energy of H2
molecule, D = 2E0−E−Enucl, to make comparison to the experimental value,
Dexper[H2] ≃ 0.164 a.u. = 4.45 eV [15]. Here, E0 = −0.5 a.u. = −13.606 eV
is the ground state energy of separate H-atom and Enucl is the energy of
zero mode harmonic oscillations of the nuclei, with the experimental value
Enucl
exper[H2] ≃ 0.01 a.u. = 0.27 eV [15]. One can see that the zero mode
energy Enucl (which is taken to be Enucl = 0, in the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation) is estimated to be less than 1% of the predicted E. The
leading anharmonic correction to the harmonic oscillation energy is estimated
to be 1.4% of Enucl, i.e.
it is of the order of 0.00014 a.u. = 0.004 eV, in
the case of H2 molecule. So, in total the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
makes only up to 1% uncertainty, which is obviously insuﬃcient to treat the
predicted R = 1.675828 a.u. as an acceptable value, from the experimental
point of view.

Note that, at the given M, we can not ”ﬁx” R to be equal to the de-
sired experimental value Rexper = 1.4011 a.u. unless we shift E to some
nonminimal value, which is, as such, meaningless. Conversely, if we would ﬁt
experimental Rexper by varying M, we were obtain Emin between −1.52 a.u.
and −1.33 a.u. (see Table 6), which is much deviated from the experimen-
tal Eexper. In other words, the relation between E and R, governed by the
Schr¨odinger equation, is such that at some value of R there is a minimum of
E so that R is not some kind of free parameter here since the system tends
to minimize its own energy. In accordance to the exact solution of the model,

39

our single free parameter, M, can not provide us with the exact ﬁt of both
the experimental values, Eexper and Rexper.

Thus, we arrive at the conclusion that the three-body Santilli-Shillady
model of H2 molecule yields the result (4.23), which indicates that the as-
sumption of stable point-like isoelectronium builds a crude approximation
to the general (four-body) Santilli-Shillady model. This means that we are
forced to possess that the isoelectronium is not stable point-like quasi-particle,
to meet the experimental data on H2 molecule.

4.3 Variational solution

In studying H +
2 ion like systems, one can use Ritz variational approach to
obtain the value of the ground state energy as well. This approach assumes
analytical calculations, which are easier than that used in ﬁnding the above
exact solution but they give approximate value of the energy. It is helpful in
making simpliﬁed analysis of the system. This can be made for the general
case of isoelectronium total mass, which eventually undergoes some ”defect”
while its ”bare” total mass is assumed to be M = 2me. Ritz variational solu-
tion of the H +
2 like problem yields, of course, similar result for the energy of
ˆH2. Below, we present shortly results of our calculations. However, we stress
that the variational solution is given here just to make some support to the
exact solution, and to see the typical order of the variational approximation.
Using hydrogen ground state wave function and one-parameter Ritz vari-
2 like system:

ation, we obtain the following expression for the energy of H +

where ρ = R/a0 is variational parameter. For the general case of mass m
and charge q = ζe, Eq.(4.24) can be rewritten in the following form:

E(ρ, ζ) =

(4.26)

40

Numerically, the function F (ρ) reaches minimum at the value ρ = 2.5, which
should be used in the above expression for E(ρ, ζ). So, putting ζ = 1 we
obtain the variational value of H +
ion energy, E(ρ) = −0.565. Note, to
2
make a comparison, that we have the value Eexact = −0.6026 due to the
exact solution (4.2), and the value Eexper[H +
2 ] = −0.6017 as the experimental
value of the energy of H +
ion. Thus, the optimal distance between the
2
protons in H +
ion is Rm = a0ρ = 2.5 a.u., and the obtained variational
2
energy E is slightly higher than both the values Eexact and Eexper, as it is
normally expected to be in the variational approach. Now, we should replace
electron by isoelectronium to describe the associated ˆH2 model. Substituting
M = 2me and ζ = 2, we see that the r.h.s. of Eq.(4.25) contains overall factor
8, in comparison to the H +

2 ion case (M = me and ζ = 1),

˜E(ρ) = 8|2EB|(cid:18)−

+ F (ρ)(cid:19) ,

(4.27)

The function F (ρ) remains the same, and its minimum is reached again at ρ =
2.5. Then, energy of H2 molecule due to Eq.(4.27) is ˜E(ρ) = −8|2EB|0.565 =
−4.520 a.u. This value should be compared with the one given by Eq.(4.4).
Below, we collect the above mentioned data and results of this Section in

5 Concluding remarks

In this paper we have shown that the restricted three-body Santilli-Shillady
isochemical model of the hydrogen molecule admits an exact analytic solu-
tion capable of representing the molecular binding energy in a way accu-
rate to the sixth digit, E = −1.174475 a.u., and the internuclear distance
R = 1.675828 a.u., which is about 19.6% bigger than the conventional ex-
perimental value, Rexper[H2] = 1.4011 a.u.

We should emphasize that the presented exact analytical solution includes
inﬁnite chain fractions. They still need numerical computation to reach the
characteristic values of H +
2 ion like systems, such as the ground state energy,
with the understanding that these values can be reached with any needed
accuracy. For example, at the lengths of the chain fractions N = 100 and
N = 50 for the angular and radial eigenvalues, one achieves accuracy of the
ground state energy of about 10−12.

The general (four-body) Santilli-Shillady isochemical model of H2 cannot
be, apparently, solved exactly, even in Born-Oppenheimer approximation, so
that Ritz variational approach can be applied here to get the approximate
values of the ground state energy and corresponding internuclear distance.

Ritz variational approach is a good instrument to analyze few-body prob-
lems, and restricted H2 molecule is such a system. It is wellknown that the
variational solution of the ordinary model of H2 molecule includes rather com-
plicated analytical calculations of the molecular integrals, with the hardest
part of work being related to the exchange integral. Particularly, evaluated
exchange integral for H2 molecule is expressed in terms of a special func-
tion (Sugiura’s result, 1927). It is quite natural to expect that even more
complications will arise when dealing with the Hulten potential.

The reason to consider the general four-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2
molecule, after the made analysis of H +
2 like system approximate approach
to it, is that the stable point-like isoelectronium ˆH2 model-based theoreti-
cal prediction does not meet the experimental data on H2 molecule, for the
”bare” isoelectronium mass M = 2me, although we achieved essentially ex-
act representation of the binding energy taking M = 0.308381me. Also, this
stable point-like isoelectronium (three-body) model does not account for es-
sential eﬀect existing in the general (four-body) model. This eﬀect is related
to the potential barrier between the region associated to the attractive Hulten
potential, r12 < r0, and the region associated to repulsive Coloumb poten-

42

tial, r12 > r0, where r0 is the distance between the electrons at which Hulten
potential is equal to Coloumb potential, V (r12) = 0; see Eq.(2.5). Char-
acteristics of the barrier can be extracted from the function V (r12). The
barrier is ﬁnite for the used values of the parameters V0 and rc so that the
electrons penetrate it. The two 1s electrons are thus simultaneously in two
regimes, the ﬁrst is strongly correlated regime due to short-range attractive
Hulten potential (isoelectronium) and the second is weakly correlated regime
due to the ordinary Coloumb repulsion. Also, there exist a transient regime
corresponding to the region about the equilibrium point, r12 ≃ r0, i.e. inside
the barrier. Schematically, one could thought of that the electrons are, for
instance, 10% in the isoelectronium regime, 1% in the transient regime, and
89% in the Coloumb regime. We stress that in the three-body approach to
H2 molecule considered in this paper we have 100% for the isoelectronium
regime.

Numerical computation by Santilli and Shillady [1] based on Gaussian
transform techniques and SASLOBE computer program has shown excel-
lent agreement of the general four-body model with experimental data on
H2 molecule. They used Gaussian screened Coloumb potential as an ap-
proximation to the Hulten potential.
It would be instructive to use Ritz
variational approach, which deals with analytical calculations, in studying
the four-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2 molecule. One can try it ﬁrst for
the Gaussian screened Coloumb potential, or exponential screened Coloumb
potential in which case there is a hope to achieve exact analytical evalua-
tion of the Coloumb and exchange integrals. Being a diﬀerent approach, this
would give a strong support to the numerical results on the ground state
energy obtained by Santilli and Shillady. Also, having analytical set up one
can make qualitative analysis of the four-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2
molecule. However, we should to note that these potentials, being approxi-
mations to the Hulten potential, will yield some approximate models, with
corresponding approximate character of the results.

Appendix

N and Q(y)
We use N = 16 power degree approximation, the polynomials Q(x)
N ,
to ﬁnd both the radial, λ(x)(p, a), and angular, λ(y)(p, b), eigenvalues of the
csf. QN ’s are obtained by the use of recurrence relations (3.76) and deﬁni-
tions of the coeﬃcients αs, βs, γs, ρs, κs, and δs, where we put b = 0, i.e.
Z1 = Z2 = 1, and quantum number m = 0. Each of the two polynomials
has 16 roots for λ from which we select one root which is appropriate due
to its asymptotic behavior at R → 0. Numerical solution of the equation
λ(x)(p, a) = λ(y)(p, b) gives us the list of values of the electronic ground state
energy E(R) = E1sσ(R), which corresponds to 1sσg term of the H +
2 ion, as
a function of the distance R between the nuclei. Table 2 presents the result,
where no interpolation has been used. Numerical computation of each point
in Table 2 took about 88 sec on ordinary Pentium desktop computer.

Below, we present some useful numerical values enabling one to convert
atomic units, at which me = e = ¯h = 1, to the other units. Note also that
for the energy 1 a.u. ≡ 1 hartree, and for the length 1 a.u. ≡ 1 bohr.

Table 2: The electronic energy of H +

2 ion (see Fig. 1).

Minimum of the energy E1sσ(R) is E1sσ = −1.9999999976 a.u. at R = 0,
which reproduces the known value E1sσ = −2 a.u. to a very high accuracy.
Moreover, one can compare Table 2 and the table of Ref.[14] to see that each
energy value in Table 2 does reproduce Wind’s result up to seven decimal
places. This means that our numerical calculations are correct.

We remark that Wind used N = 50 approximation and presented seven
decimal places while we use N = 16 approximation and present seventeen
decimal places. Alas, there is no need to keep such a high accuracy, and also
Wind mentioned that even N = 10 approximation gives the same result, up
to seven digits.

By making 16th-order interpolation of the points in Table 2 and adding
to it the potential of interaction between the nuclei, 1/R, we obtain the list of
values of the total energy presented in Table 3. It reveals the only minimum
of the total energy, E(R) + R−1 = Emin = −0.6026346 a.u. at the distance

Table 3: The total energy of H +

2 ion (see Fig. 2).

The results collected in Table 4 have been obtained directly by numerical
calculations with the use of replacements p2 → 2p2 and a → 4a, where p
and a are deﬁned by Eq.(3.50), in the coeﬃcients αs, βs, γs, ρs, κs, and
δs of the recurrence relations. These replacements have been made due to
Eq.(3.15), with the mass parameter M = 2 and the charge parameter q = −2,
corresponding to the stable point-like isoelectronium of mass M = 2me and
charge −2e. In addition, it turns out that Table 4 can be derived directly from
Table 2 by the use of rescalements R → R/4 and E → 8E. This remarkable
property is conﬁrmed by the scaling method developed in Sec. 4.2, and proves
that the scaling method is correct. By adding 1/R to the isoelectronic energy
values of Table 4 we obtain Table 5 showing the total energy of the ˆH2
system, at the mass M = 2me. The minimum of the total energy is found
E(R) + R−1 = Emin = −7.617041 a.u. at R = Ropt = 0.258399 a.u.

Table 6: The minimal total energy Emin and the optimal internuclear distance
Ropt of the three-body ˆH2 system as functions of the mass M of the stable
point-like isoelectronium (see Figs. 5–8).

Table 6 presents result of calculations of the minimal total energies and
corresponding optimal distances, at various values of the isoelectronium mass
parameter M = ηme (M = η, in atomic units). We have derived some 27
tables (such as Table 5) from Table 2 by the scaling method according to
Eq.(4.21), and ﬁnd minimum of the total energy in each table, together
with the corresponding optimal distance. Then we collected all the obtained
energy minima and optimal distances in Table 6. With the fourth order in-
terpolation/extrapolation, the graphical representations of Table 6 show (see
Figures 5–8) that the minimal total energy behaves as Emin(M) ≃ −3.808M,

48

and the optimal distance behaves as Ropt(M) ≃ 0.517/M, to a good accu-
racy. One can see that at M = 2me we have Emin(M) = −7.617040 a.u.
and Ropt(M) = 0.258396 a.u., which recover the earlier obtained values
Emin = −7.617041 a.u. and Ropt = 0.258399 a.u. of Table 5, to a high ac-
curacy, thus showing once again correctness of the used scaling method. In
fact, the values of E and R for M = 1.50me, M = 1.75me, and M = 2.00me
in Table 6 have been obtained by extrapolation so they are not as much ac-
curate as they are in Table 5. However, this is not of much importance here
because we use them only to check the results of the scaling method.

The main conclusion following from Table 6 is that the mass parameter
value M = 0.308381me ﬁts the energy value Emin(M) = −1.174475 a.u.,
with the corresponding Ropt(M) = 1.675828 a.u., which appears to be about
19.6% bigger than the experimental value Rexper[H2] = 1.4011 a.u. The total
energy as a function of internuclear distance, for this value of mass, M =
0.308381me, is shown in Figure 9 to illustrate that the obtained optimal
distance Ropt = 1.675828 a.u. corresponds to a minimal value of the total
energy.

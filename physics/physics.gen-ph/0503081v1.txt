Abstract

A polynomial is presented that models a topological knot in a unique manner.
It distinguishes all types of knots including the orientation and has a group theory
interpretation. The topologies may be labeled via a number, which upon a base 2
expansion generate the polynomial; the equivalent numbers via Reidemeister moves
are grouped into a superset polynomial with coeﬃcients labeling the equivalent knots.

1 Introduction

The classiﬁcation of knots topologically has been of interest for many years, but
a unique invariant appears to be lacking in the literature.
In this paper a unique
invariant is given.

There are several forms of knot invariants written in polynomial form, and they
are of both mathematical and physical interest [1],[2]. An invariant that distinguishes
all topologies from each other is relevant for many reasons.

The invariant presented here relies on labeling all intersections of the curve in
three dimensions by two by two matrices. These two-by-two matrices are assembled
into a larger matrix which could serve as an invariant; however, both for notational
purposes and to make contact with previous forms this larger matrix is projected onto
Sp(2n) adjoint generators into a polynomial form.

The knot is ﬁrst labeled in the manner: (1) a starting point is chosen on the
contour, (2) the knot is given a direction by attaching arrows one way through the
contour, (3) a number is attached to every intersection along this direction post (or
prior) to every intersection, and (4) each intersection of the contour with itself takes on
only one of four forms and is labeled by two numbers generated in (3). Furthermore,
the four types of oriented intersections are illustrated in the ﬁgure 1(a).

These four types of oriented intersections are labeled with a two by two matrix.

These matrices are,

M1 =

1 0
0 0 !

 

M2 =

0
0

 

1
0 !

M3 =

0 0
1 0 !

 

M4 =

0 0
0 1 !

 

.

There are a total of n intersections in the knot conﬁguration, which through a single
closed contour are passed through twice each in traversing the loop. These matrices
are assembled into a 2n by 2n matrix M via block form by inserting at position (i,j)
the two by two matrix associated with the (i,j) node along the contour; this ﬁlls up all
but the diagonal elements. The diagonal entries along (i,i) are given an empty two by
two matrix. Also, via following the arrows, the lower triangular two by two matrices
are the transpose of the upper triangular ones and the matrix satisﬁes M = M T . (Up
and then under to the right, M1, is the transpose of passing through the intersection
along the path of the other arrow, which is up and then over to the right, M4).

This matrix is a member of Sp(2n) and allows a projection onto the adjoint
i aiT i. Note that all entries are unity, which means that the
representation, M =
knot matrix is associated with the homology of a (possibly degenerate) Riemann
surface Σn of genus n. Without loss of information, one could put minus signs in the
upper triangular portion so that the ﬁnal matrix satisﬁes M = −M T , i.e. a member
of SO(2n). The Sp(2n) (or SO(2n)) generators could be given the standard form,

P

The polynomial invariant is constructed from the topology of the knot, in M,
aiT i. The coeﬃcients ai from this explicit projection are

via the projection M =
assembled into the form P (z),

P (z) =

The invariant in (1.4) is unique and distinguishes all of the possible topologies, be-
cause the matrix uniquely reconstructs the knot and there is no loss of information
between M and P (z). There is an ambiguity in mapping the coeﬃcients in the matrix
aiT i to the polynomial invariant in (1.4). The ambiguity is
decomposition M =
removed via labeling one to one in order T i ↔ zi.

As an illustration of the procedure, one of the two trefoil knots in ﬁgure 1(b) is
analyzed. The trefoil knot has three intersections and so is dimension twelve. The
associated matrix Mt written in block form with the Mj matrices is,

The decomposition of this trefoil’s Mt is a8,1 = 1, a9,4 = 1, and a12,5 = 1 (with
symmetrization). The polynomial Pt(z) is, via the decomposition of the generators
through z(j−1)∗2n+i,

Pt(z) = z8 + z40 + z60 .

Note that this labeling of the generators has vanishing elements for diagonal elements
i = j. This simple example describes the procedure for ﬁnding M and P (z).
It
is not clear if this polynomial can be given further number theoretic or geometric
interpretation due to the appearance of the numbers 8 ∗ (1, 5, 12).

The Reidemeister moves may also be examined in this context. There are three
moves that are analyzed. The ﬁrst one involves an overlap with a twist, depicted in
ﬁgure 1, and amounts to an expansion of the matrix M in the i row and i + 1 column
with the matrix entry M1,

z2(i−1)n+2(i+1)+1 ,

(1.7)

while changing the rest of the matrix with zeros in the ith row and and i+1th column,
via a M1. The second Reidemeister move involves the inclusion of two additional
matrices M4 and M2, at the nodes i, j + 1 and i + 1, j. This involves enlarging the
matrix M by the terms

z2in+2(j+1) + z2in+2j ,

(1.8)

with zeros placed in the columns and rows of the entries at i, j + 1 and i + 1, j. The
third move involves the triple crossing, i.e. a slide of a bar, from the entries M4 at
(i, j), M2 at (j + 1, k + 1) and M4 and (i + 1, k); to the entries M3 at (j, k), M1 at
(k + 1, i), and M1 at (j + 1, k + 1). This involves the change of the entries from these
nodes from,

z2in+2j + z2jn+2(k+1) + z2(i+1)n+k

(1.9)

to

zjn+2(k−1)+1 + zkn+2(i−1)+1 + zjn+2k+1 .

(1.10)

These Reidemeister moves may be incorporated directly at the level of the polynomials
P (z) or in the matrices M.

The polynomial form of the invariant P (z) = aizi with the unit coeﬃcients ai

may be given a base 2 interpretation via the expansion of a number

4

N = aizi

(1.11)

with the expansion over the base 2 numbers z0 = 1, z1 = 2, z2 = 4, etc. Not all
numbers N may be reached via the expansion due to the expansion of the matrices M1,
M2, M3, and M4. However, another interpretation is given in base 4 via the expansion
of the matrix invariant with the labels 1 through 4. Considering the equivalence of
the knots via the Reidemeister moves, a family of equivalences may be deﬁned via a
new polynomial QN (z),

QN (z) =

biwi ,

(1.12)

X
with the ﬁrst coeﬃcient b0 deﬁning the fundamental (minimal) knot. The coeﬃcients
bi are numbers labeling further knots related to the minimal knot via Reidemeister
moves. These numbers are base two (or base four), spanning the knot topology via
the expansion,

bi =

jzi ,
ai

X

(1.13)

with the bi essentially P (z). The tower of numbers bi may be obtained by direct calcu-
lation or an iteration of the fundamental knot. There is potentially interesting group
theory characteristics, e.g. representation dimensions, associated with the numbers
bi. For example, the individual equivalence classes form separate ﬁelds, subsets of the
integers, which are closed under the Reidemeister moves.

The invariant P (z) is unique and completely characterizes the knot conﬁguration;
multiple disconnected but entangled contours are also described via the labeling of
the intersections. Due to the construction this invariant has a group theoretic sym-
plectic interpretation. The matrix forms M of the polynomials could be investigated
further for more information (e.g. invariants of matrices, embeddings of one knot into
another, quotients, . . .). Furthermore, the matrix form has an interpretation in terms
of the homology of a max genus n Riemann surface.

The polynomial form should have relations to other commonly used invariants
such as the HOMFLY, Jones, Kauﬀman, or Vassiliev ones. Although these latter
forms do not uniquely specify the knot conﬁguration, the relation is relevant to physics
models and mathematics.

Because the invariant P (z) is unique, the classiﬁcation and further development
of associated three-dimensional Seifert manifolds, such as cohomology directly from
P (z), may be found in a more direct fashion. The algebraic nature of the knot further
relates to geometry in d = 2 via the zero set P (z) = 0.

Last, the invariants P (z) presented here always have unit coeﬃcients. The in-
aizi. Other
formation is encoded in the exponents i in the expansion P (z) =
invariants are typically of lower degree, but with non-unity in the (seemingly less
sparse) coeﬃcients; the P (z) here contain more information in the exponents appar-
ently. The informaton content is the same however, apart from the uniqueness issue.
In comparison between the coeﬃcients and exponents, it is not obvious how many
bytes of information the diﬀerent forms require to label a knot.

P

The equivalence classes of the knot numbers via the Reidemeister moves is found
via the polynomial operations. These have an indirect number form fσ(i)(N) for the
actions σ(i) of the moves i on the knot number N.

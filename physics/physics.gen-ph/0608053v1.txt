Abstract

We review the energy contents formulae of Kerr-Newman black-holes, where gravitomagnetic

energy term comes to play(Berman, 2006; 2006a; 2004). Then, we obtain the angular momenta

formulae, which include the gravitomagnetic eﬀect. Three theorems can be enunciated:

(1) No black-hole has its energy conﬁned to its interior;

(2) Rotating black-holes do not have conﬁned angular momenta;

(3) The energy density of a black-hole is not conﬁned to its interior.

Keywords: Einstein; Black Holes; Gravitomagnetism; Angular Momentum; Energy; Astro-

physical Objects.

GRAVITOMAGNETISM AND ANGULAR
MOMENTA OF BLACK-HOLES

Marcelo Samuel Berman

The calculation of energy and angular momentum of black-holes, has, among others, an

important astrophysical rˆole, because such objects remain the ultimate source of energy in

the Universe, and the amount of angular momentum is related to the possible amount of

extraction of energy from the b.h.(Levinson, 2006).

In a series of excellent papers, Virbhadra(1990; 1990a; 1990b) and Aguirregabiria et

al.(1996) calculated the energy contents, as well as the angular momenta, for Kerr-Newman

black-holes. Notwhistanding the high quality of those papers, Berman(2004; 2006; 2006a)

has pointed out that their results for the energy do not reduce to the correct well known

result by Adler et al.(1975), when the electric charge and rotation parameters go to zero.

Furthermore, Berman objected the energy formula obtained by Virbhadra, and Aguirre-

gabiria et al., because the gravitomagnetic eﬀect on the energy contents of the Kerr-Newman

black-hole does not appear in their results. Soon afterwards, Ciufolini and Pavlis(2004) and

Ciufolini(2005) reported the experimental veriﬁcation of the Lens-Thirring eﬀect. This eﬀect

is a consequence of the concept of gravitomagnetism.

Therefore, it is now interesting to check whether the calculation of angular momenta

contents for a K.N. black hole given by Virbhadra, and Aguirregabiria et al., includes the

gravitomagnetic contribution. It will be seen that this does not occur. We recalculate here

the angular momenta formulae, in order that gravitomagnetism enters into the scenario. We

cite in our favor, the papers by Lynden-Bell and Katz(1985) and Katz and Ori(1990).

The metric for a K.N. black hole may be given in Cartesian coordinates by:

In the above, M , Q and ”a” stand respectivelly for the mass, electric charge, and

the rotational parameter, which has been shown to be given by:

a = JT OT
M

,

(5)

where JT OT stands for the total angular momentum of the system.

According to Virbhadra and Aguirregabiria et al., the energy-momentum pseudo tensor

is given by:

It must be remarked that when we calculate, in this paper, energy or angular momentum

contents, we suppose that the calculation is done over a closed surface with constant ρ ;

the total energy and the total angular momentum, should be calculated in the limit ρ

→ ∞

.

If we expand relation (6) in powers of ( a

ρ ) , and retain only the ﬁrst and second powers,

we obtain the approximate relation, valid for slow rotational motion:

(13)

Unfortunately, when Q = 0 in the above equations, we are left without gravitomagnetic

eﬀects. The corrections made by Berman, in the above cited papers, reside on the acknowl-

edgment that due to the same R−2 dependence of the gravitation and electric interactions,

as characterized by Newton’s law of gravitation, and Coulomb’s law for electric charges, we

would have on a par, the equal contributions of charge and mass in the above formulae, so

that, except for the inclusion of the inertial term, we should make the correction:

In corroboration of correction (14), we cite that, for the Reissner-Nordstr¨om metric, the

energy formula is given by:

ERN = M

Relation(15) reduces correctly to the energy formula published by Adler et al.(1975) for

the spherical mass distribution, when we make Q = 0 in (15). To the contrary, relations

(6) and (8) do not reduce to Adler et al.’s

formula when a = Q = 0 , neither to the

relation(15), when a = 0 in relation(8). This shows that correction (14)

is plausible. In

The last result ”validates” the coordinate system chosen for the present calculation: it

is tantamount to the choice of a center-of-mass coordinate system in Newtonian Physics, or

the use of comoving observers in Cosmology.

the ﬁrst of these eﬀects in the year 1990, but since then it seems that he failed to recognize

the existence of the gravitomagnetic energy due to M, on an equal footing.

where P0 would be given by the approximation (22), with P0 = E . (Berman, 2004;

We recollect now a series of statements that we have shown above to be incorrect, and

which appeared in the papers by Virbhadra and Aguirregabiria et al.:

A) no angular momentum is associated with the exterior in Kerr’s metric;

B) no energy is shared by the exterior of the Kerr black hole;

C) the energy density in the Kerr black hole equals zero;

D) the energy density in the Schwarzschild’s black hole equals zero;

E) the entire energy of Schwarzschild’s black hole is conﬁned to its interior.

Instead, three correct statements are issued by us:

(1) No black-hole has its energy conﬁned to its interior;

(2) Rotating black-holes do not have conﬁned angular momenta;

6

(3) The energy density of a black-hole is not conﬁned to its interior.

We further conclude that we may identify the gravitomagnetic contribution to the energy

and angular momentum of the K.N. black hole, for the slow rotating case, as:

∆E ∼=

M 2a2

and,
∆J ∼=

as can be checked from relations (8) and (28) above.

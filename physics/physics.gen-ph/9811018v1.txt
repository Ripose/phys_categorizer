Abstract

Conventional Planck system of absolute units (G, c, ¯h, kB) is en-
larged by the addition of the so-called, dynamical constant Γ , that
relates force to the rate of change of linear momentum. A further en-
largement allows its applications to electromagnetism by introducing
the permitivity of the vacuum ǫ0, as a new absolute unit. Conse-
quenly there are six reference dimension (M, L, T, F, Θ, I) where F
and I stand for dimensions of force and electric current respectively.
In such an ” enlarged Planck system ” ( E.P.S) we equalize its unit of
charge to the elementary one, e, with the result that Γ coincide with
the ﬁne-structure constant, α. In the proposed E.P.S. the constants
G, c, ¯h, kB, ǫ0, µ0, Γ, e, α acquire very simple numerical values, (most
of them are equal to the unity), although in our view they retain their
physical dimensions. A calculation of the main quantities in the E.P.S.
and some considerations that may concern homogeneity and isotropy
conditions in the very early universe are made.

1 Planck System.

Admitedly the Planck absolute system of units ( P.A.S.U.) rests on the gravi-
tational constant G , quantum of action ¯h, velocity of light c and Boltzmann‘s
constant kB . The units of length (Planck length lp), of time (tp), of mass
(mp) and the temperature can be expressed in terms of the selected universal
constants as:

lp =
tp =
mp =

The meaning of these quantities is not yet quite settled, but there is no doubt
about their importance. As Planck himself states:

” these quantities maintain their natural signiﬁcance as long as the laws
of gravitation, of propagations of light in vacuum and of both ﬁrst and second
laws of thermodynamics, remain valid. They must consequently always turn
up the same, even when measured by most diﬀerent inteligent beings with the
most diﬀerent methods ”

A more modern insight allows for lp two posible views: either that the
nature of physical phenomena changes radically for lenghs lower than lp , or
that lp is the lowest limit of lenght what amounts to state that we cannot
distinguish between points whose distance is lowest than lp. Planck‘s time, tp,
is supposed to replace the original singularity in the very early universe(see
[3]). Planck‘s mass, mp, seems to represent a maximon, i.e. the ﬁnal mass
of a mini black hole submitted to Hawking‘s radiation(see [M]). Planck‘s
temperature, Θp , can be interpreted as the temperature in the very early
universe (big-bang) with pressure predominance.

Currently Planck‘s charge is calculated as a relation among the constants
and the

G, c, ¯h what corresponds to a mutilated base (see [6])
expresion

L, M, T

qp = √¯hc

is unavoidably obtained. That result is in our view, untenable, since the
dimensions of electrical charge cannot be reducible to mechanical ones. This

2

is one of the reasons that we have considered to propose an enlargement of
Plack‘s system. A further enlargement derives from the fact that force and
rate of change of linear momentum are diﬀerent quantities. These features
justify, in our view, the enlargement of Planck System that follows.

Enlargement of the System.

Our ﬁrst step is adding to the constans sellected by Planck (G, c, ¯h, kB) the
dynamical constant Γ , already considered by Bridgman in another context
(see [1])

−→F = Γ

d(m−→v )
dt

(3)

(4)

Γ relates inertial force to the rate of change of linear moment, and parallels
the expresion for gravitational force F = G mm′
r2 , that justiﬁes the presence
of G.
In our opinion the main reason for the general acceptance of G as
a universal constant, derives from the fact that making use of conventional
units , its numerical value is very small. This is not ”a priori” the case with
Γ that has been, in our view improperly excluded. Its inclusion increases the
where F stands for dimensions of force. In

L, M, T
{
this base the proposed universal constant, Γ, acquire the dimensions

Since Γ has not yet been numerically deﬁned, we are free to make the best
selection for the value of qp .
In our view the most advantageous and
simple hypothesis is to assimilate Planck‘s charge to the electron charge
(e− = 10−18.795289C) . Then:

This completes the enlargement.

3.4 Homogeneity and isotropy.
Commonly Planck volumen τp is taken as τp = l3
p . At the begining of this
paper we considered lp as the lowest limit of length what amounts to state
that we cannot distinguish between points whose distance is lower than lp.
Consequently we ought to consider the volume of a sphere with diameter lp
as the lowest limit of Planck‘s volume. Then τp ≥
p and we can write
τ ′
p ≥

We deﬁne the Planck‘s energy density, in the E.P.S. as:

Admitedly (see[4]) in the very early universe the following expresion ought

In the case of thermal radiation, the particles will be only photons and then

4 Remark

In this paper we have proposed an approach to a fruitful enlargement of
Planck System. However we want to remark that most of the results may
be quantitativelly altered. We have selected the set of universal constant
most generally considered as constituting Planck System (G, c, ¯h, kB) . But it
k4
migth prove advisable to select h instead of ¯h, and/or a = π2
B
¯h3c3 (Boltzman
constant) instead of kB , to give only two examples among many possibles.
The best ﬁtting of the numerical results to their most probable values is
perhaps the most suitable guideline.

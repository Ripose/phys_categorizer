In this paper, a new theory, based on the principles of the general relativity is proposed. In this
framework, quantum wave equations for spin 0 and spin 1/2 particles, in the Schwarzschild metric,
are derived. As a test the hydrogen atom spectrum is calculated. The implications of the theory
considering the strong interactions are also discussed. Conﬁnement eﬀects arise from the theory.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The general theory of the relativity, proposed in 1916 by Einstein, was one of the major scientiﬁc discoveries of last
century. Besides providing very accurate theoretical results, it was a great advance in the understanding the Nature,
dealing with the structure of the space-time.

A question of interest is, how the quantum theory can be aﬀected by the space-time. Dirac, formulated his theory
[1], based in the ﬂat space-time of the special theory of the relativity, and with this formulation, the spin and the
antiparticles appeared naturally into the theory.

About curved spaces, many authors, as for example [2], [3], [4] proposed methods to quantize the gravity, where

still there are many diﬃculties and opened questions to be understood.

In this work, a new theory is proposed. Here, instead of trying to quantize the gravity, the eﬀects of the metric
in the subatomic world will be studied. For this purpose, the basic idea is to describe a particle in a region with a
potential that aﬀects the metric of the space-time. We are not interested in gravitational eﬀects, as in [5], where the
eﬀect of gravitational forces in the hydrogen atom spectrum has been included. So, the gravitational potential will
be turned oﬀ and only the other interactions (strong, electromagnetic) will be considered. Observing that the masses
of the particles are very small, and the small value of the gravitational coupling, when compared with the electric
or strong ones, one can say that it is an excellent approximation. Inside this space-time, curved by the interaction,
according to the general covariance, quantum wave equations will be proposed. Then some simple applications will
be made, in order to verify the predictions of the theory.

This paper will show the following contents: In Sec. II the operators in the Schwarzschild metric will be calculated,
in Sec III, a brief review of the dynamics will be made, in Secs.
IV and V the quantum wave equations will be
proposed. In Sec VI we will apply the theory to the hydrogen atom, calculating its energy spectrum and in Sec. VII,
the strong interactions will be considered. In Sec. VIII, the conclusions will be presented.

II. THE METRIC

In this section we will calculate the operators (E, ~p, p2) needed in order to write the wave equations, using the
general relativity principles. As a ﬁrst step, a system with spherical symmetry will be considered, but the basic ideas
can be generalized to systems with arbitrary metrics.

We will consider a particle inside a ﬁeld, that may be described by a potential function V . The source of the ﬁeld
(a mass for a gravitational ﬁeld or a charge for an electromagnetic ﬁeld) will have some distribution, described by a
tensor Tµν 6
Outside of the source distribution, on the empty space (where Tµν = 0) if we consider a system that presents
spherical symmetry, with a central potential V (r), the space-time may be described by the Schwarzschild metric
[6],[7],[8],

= 0, in a certain space region.

With the operators calculated in this section, one can obtain the relativistic quantum wave equations. If another
symmetry is important (as axial symmetry, for example ), the operators can be obtained in a similar way in the given
metric.

III. SCHWARZSCHILD DYNAMICS

In order to obtain the wave equations, two expressions are needed: the energy and ξ(r). Then, also with the
function of setting the notation, it is useful to make a brief review of the dynamics, in the Schwarzschild metric, and
to show how the quantities of interest can be expressed.

The expressions (36) and (37) will be used to construct the Hamiltonian operators.
The term ξ is a function of r only, and can be determined if we observe Eq. (37)

E(β = 0) = E0ξ1/2 = E0 + V ,

that means that in the rest frame of the particle, the energy is due to the sum of its rest mass with the potential.

and can be solved for a given interaction potential V (r), that determines ξ(r).

V. SPIN-1/2 PARTICLES WAVE EQUATIONS

With the knowledge of the energy (36) and ξ(r) (39), it is possible to formulate wave equations in the Schwarzschild
metric. The simplest case is to obtain the equation for spin-0 particles. For this purpose, the procedure to be followed
is the same one that is used to determine the Klein-Gordon equation, that is based in an operator for E2. Using the
relation (9)

The next step, is to obtain the analog of the Dirac equation, for spin-1/2 particles. That can be made in the same
way that it was made by Dirac [1], using an Hamiltonian with the ~α and β Dirac matrices, instead of an energy
operator with an square root, from Eq. (37). Then we have

and if we square the operators in both sides of the equation, we obtain Eq. (46), that proofs that the procedure used
by Dirac, is also valid in this case.

VI. THE HYDROGEN ATOM

that are equations very similar to the ones obtained from the Dirac theory. In the following sections, some physical
implications of this theory will be studied.

In this section we will study the behavior of the theory, in a very well known system, the hydrogen atom. In the

hydrogen atom, the electron is submitted to an electric central potential (obviously with Z = 1)

and the ξ function becomes (where ep means electron-proton)

where me is the electron mass. This function represents a space-time curved by the ep interaction, or how space-time
is seen by the electron. At this point we can see an interesting feature of the theory: when general relativity is used
to study the gravitation, the radius where the metric breaks (ξ = 0) , that is the Schwarzchild radius, rs, is always
negligible, as for example r =2.95 Km for the sun. But in the hydrogen atom (with the parameters of [14])

rs =

α
mec2 = 2.818 fm ,

that is the classic radius of the electron, which is obviously not negligible. The estimated radius of the proton is about
0.9-1.0 fm, so, it is located inside the horizon of events. Then, the electric charge will be conﬁned inside this region
by a trapping surface, as deﬁned in [16], and outside, only eﬀects of the total charge can be probed by the electron,
and no information about the inner structure can be obtained.

Inserting ξep from the expression (59) in the equations (57) we obtain the equations, but valid only for r > rs.
Inside the horizon of events, the metric is not the same, the energy-momentum tensor Tµν determined by the charge
and matter distributions must be considered. In this paper we shall study only the outside behavior. It is illustrative
to study the approximation

We must remark that in the approximation of Eq. (61), the metric divergence at r = rs (that is not a physical
singularity, it appears from the choice of the coordinate system) is removed, and the them the wave functions must be
controlled only at the physical singularity, at the origin. One must remark, that at the atomic level, an approximation
of the order of 2.8 fm is not so bad. From these expressions, it is possible to calculate the energy spectrum. Using
the standard methods [9], [11], [12] one obtains

the accuracy of the results, the recoiling proton eﬀect is also important [15], but it was not considered here. The most
important fact that must be observed is conceptual, the spectrum (67) is a result from general covariance, and (70),
obtained from special relativity, is not (even considering that the corrections are very small, but they actually exist).

An exact treatment of Eq. (57) requires the knowledge of the energy-momentum tensor Tµν in the interior region,

that determines the spatial distribution of the electric charge. This treatment shall not be done in this paper.

VII. STRONG INTERACTIONS

In this section, the implications of the theory, when strong interactions are taken into account will be studied. The
simplest system possible is the N N interaction. If, as a ﬁrst approximation, only the long range part of the potential
would be considered, it should be dominated by the one pion exchange contribution (Yukawa potential),

where g2 = 13.40 is the N N coupling constant and µ is the pion mass. As V (r) is a function only of r, if we locate
one nucleon at the origin, we would have

V (r) = g

However, as it is well known, the N N potential is not central, and there are other contributions, such as the tensor
part [17], [18], [19] that arises from more complex processes (two pion exchange [20] and others). In order to make
some estimates, some symmetrical cases of the Reid [18] potentials can be used, as they are phenomenological ones
and can give a ﬁrst idea of the Schwarzschild radius. The potentials are superpositions of Yukawa type terms,

Thus, the part of the source of the strong force that is inside the horizon of events will be submitted to the the
trapping eﬀect [16], that prevents the escape of any matter and radiation, what means radial collapse of the source
of the strong forces.

It must be noted that the potentials containing spin dependent terms and others were not considered, fact that
would break the spherical symmetry. However, in a ﬁrst approximation, these terms can be considered as corrections
to the central potential. But even if we consider these terms, with another metric, as for example an axial symmetric
metric, the trapping surface would still exists, conﬁrming the present conclusions, and, only giving a more accurate
estimate of the size of the conﬁning region. Collapse is not an exclusive feature of spherical symmetric systems, as it
was stated in [16], deviations from spherical symmetry cannot prevent space-time singularities from arising.

As we can see, when strong interactions are considered, the horizon of events is located in a radius that is not
negligible. The preceding example gives an estimate in the range of 0.3-0.5 fm. This fact suggests that the quark
conﬁnement may be understood from these results. To understand the mechanism, let us consider that the source
of the strong force obeys some matter distribution. Each element of this matter distribution, (that may be a quark,
but in general, this assumption is not necessary) with mass m0, suﬀers the action of an attractive strong force. Some
models [21], [22],[23], [24] consider central columbic potentials of the type (58) to describe the eﬀective interaction to
which the quarks are submitted inside an hadron. A good example is the Cornell model [25], that with a linear plus

If a s quark (with mass

100 MeV) is submitted to a potential (58) with α

0.5, that is the Cornell potential
1 fm, value very close to the size of a typical barion.
(79) for small values of r, the Schwarzschid radius will be rs ∼
Considering the light u and d quarks, it is also possible to obtain the same behavior, if the α constant is smaller. If
the whole quark content of the hadron is located inside rs (now, spherical symmetry is a good choice), the classical
description of such a system would predict the collapse of the whole matter in the singularity located at r = 0.
However, as we are dealing with a quantum system, the uncertainty principle will prevent this collapse. Consequently,
there are two opposite eﬀects acting on the elements of matter, and the resulting eﬀect will be radial oscillations.
This eﬀect, in a ﬂat Minkowski space-time may be described by eﬀective potentials of the form

There is no surprise why some authors [26], [27], explain the hadronic structure with models based on harmonic
oscillator quark models or with linear potentials of the type λr[28], [25]. Inside the horizon of events, V > E0, so Eq.
(57) can be expanded as

where terms similar to the eﬀective potential (80) appears. So, considering a columbic potential (fact that is not
strictly necessary, other kind of potentials may present similar proprieties) with the correct parameters, conﬁnement
eﬀects may occur, fact that is widely used, with the addition of conﬁning potentials in ﬂat space-times.

VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, quantum wave equations, based on a new theory, that considers the general relativity in the
Schwarzschild metric, have been obtained. Investigating the hydrogen atom spectrum, the approximate expression
resulting from the theory (69) is in accord with the experimental values, and shows the general relativistic corrections
(that are small), when compared with the standard relativistic spectrum (70).

An interesting feature of the theory, is that in the Schwarzschild metric, the horizon of events appears for r = rs,
with a value that is not negligible, as it happens when the gravitational interaction is considered. When considering
the strong interaction, rs shows a region inside the hadron, where conﬁnement arises. From this theory, conﬁnement
may be considered as an intrinsic propriety of the space-time, that when interactions with large coupling constants are
considered, generates trapping surfaces. On the other hand, no collapse for r = 0 is expected, the uncertain principle

forbids it. ξ as deﬁned in Eq. (39) is a function of α/m, so, in Nature, α and m are such that the conﬁnement
conditions are ﬁlled and in a region with the observed size.

Thinking matter as composed of small black holes may seem a weird idea, but no one has actually seen a quark, or
an element of strongly interacting matter, and in this sense, a black hole is quite reasonable. At astronomical level
also, it is possible to imagine systems that cannot be seen, due to the curvature caused by electromagnetic or strong
forces, and maybe giving an important contribution to the mass of the universe.

The most important feature of the theory, is the fact that the insertion of general relativistic aspects in the quantum

theory generates results that are in accord with the phenomenology of the considered systems.

THE SCALED UNIVERSE

Abstract

It is shown that the mysterious quantum prescription of micro-
physics has analogues at the scale of stars, galaxies and superclusters,
the common feature in all these cases being Brownian type fractal-
ity. These considerations are shown to lead to pleasingly meaningful
results in agreement with observed data.

1 Introduction

It has been argued by several authors[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] that it is a Brownian
process that underlies quantum behaviour and a fractal dimension of two for
quantum paths. On the other hand the fractal nature of the macro universe
has been noticed over the past several years [7, 8, 9, 10].
Indeed, this is
obvious– matter is concentrated in atoms, stars and planets, galaxies, clusters
and so on [11] and not spread uniformly. Indeed, uniformity is dependant on
the scale of observation or resolution. Not just that: the mysterious curiosity
of a ”cosmic” quantization has also been noticed[3, 12, 13, 14]. We will now
show that the underlying connection between quantum type phenomena at
there exists what may be
diﬀerent scales has a Brownian underpinning:
called, a ”Scaled Quantum Mechanics”.

We ﬁrst observe that in Brownian motion we have[15]

where, for example ∆x is the typical length of a step, n is the number of
steps and x is the distance covered.
We next observe that the following relations hold:

1080 is the

number of elementary particles, typically pions in the universe and l is the
pion Compton wavelength.
Equations (5) and (1) have been compared and it has been argued [5] that
this is symptomatic of quantum behaviour. Here, the Compton wavelength
is a length scale within which we can ﬁnd the corresponding mass. In this
same spirit and in the light of the comments in Section 1, we can expect that
equations (2) to (4) would also lead to a quantum type behaviour though,
not at the micro scale represented by the pion (as in equation (5)) but rather
at a suitable higher scale.
Infact as we will now show, this is indeed the case with a scaled Planck
constant given by

Let us start with equation (5). It is quite remarkable that (5), (and a cor-
responding equation with the radius of the universe replaced by its age and
the Compton wavelength replaced by its Compton time) can be deduced in a
cosmological scheme in which elementary particles, typically pions are ﬂuctu-
ationally produced out of a background Zero Point Field[16, 17, 18, 19]. This
scheme is consistent with astrophysical observations and also deduces from
theory the various large number relations which were hitherto considered to
be magical coincidences. Further, we have,

where M is the mass of the universe and m the pion mass and N is deﬁned
in (5). From (9) and (5) we can deduce,

From (10), we can easily deduce that there is the scaled Planck constant h1
given in (6), such that,

Equation (11) shows that with this scaled constant h1, the radius of the
universe turns out to be the counterpart of the Compton wavelength. Earlier
it was argued[20, 21] that an electron could be modelled as a Kerr-Newman
Black Hole with radius given by the Compton wavelength. It is interesting
to note that this is also true for the universe itself with the scaled Compton
wavelength: Infact in the case of the electron, the spin was given by

where the domain of integration was a sphere of radius given by the Compton
wavelength[20, 22]. If this is carried over to the case of the universe, with
radius given by (5) or (11) and mass as in (9) we get from (12)

where h1 is as in (6) and SU denotes the counterpart of electron spin.
Infact the origin of h1 is in (13): From this point of view, (6) is not myste-
rious. In this case h1 turns out to be the spin of the universe itself in broad
agreement with Godel’s spin value for Einstein’s equations [23]. Incidentally
this is also in agreement with the Kerr limit of the spin of the rotating Black
Hole of mass given by (9). Further as pointed out by Kogut and others, the
angular momentum of the universe given in (13) is compatible with a rota-
tion from the cosmic background radiation anisotropy[24]. Finally it is also
close to the observed rotation as deduced from anisotropy of cosmic electro-
magnetic radiation as reported by Nodland and Ralston and others[25].
We next use (3), and the well known fact that G mG
the relation,

v2 [26], along with

l2 ∼

mGvl2 = h2,
which is the analogue of quantized angular momenta. It immediately follows
that h2

follows that

which is consistent with the quantized large scale velocities that have been
observed [13].
Similarly taking the cue from (4), if in conjunction with the well known
Kepler type equation viz.,

mS
r ∼
where mS is the mass of the sun, we use the counterpart of equation (14) for
the sun, can get the relation (8), and then the planetary angular momentum,
nh3 gives correctly what may be called the BodeTitius type relation for
∼
the planetary distances. This was noted by Nottale, Agnese, Festa, Laskar,
Carneiro and others[3, 14, 12] and so will not be elaborated here. The above
considerations not only provide a rationale for this behaviour, but also show
how this ﬁts into a more generalized scaling principle.

3 Discussion

(i) We have given a rationale for quantum like behaviour at large scales, ex-
pressed by equations (6), (7) and (8). These express scales at the level of

4

superclusters (and the universe), galaxies and stars. It may be mentioned
that a hierarchical structure in the context of the now defunct strong gravity
was considered by Caldirola and coworkers[27].
(ii) We saw in Section 2 that the universe shows up as a black hole. Indeed
this has been argued from an alternative view point (cf.ref.[18]). Moreover,
this is symptomatic of a holistic or Machian behaviour (cf.ref.[3]). This in-
fact has been the purport of earlier considerations (cf.refs.[5] and [19], for
example).
Moreover, this universal black hole could just be a scale expressing the upper
limit of our capability to observe. In the spirit of reference [17], there could
be several such black holes or parallel universes.
In this context, we may refer to the fact that in earlier work (cf.
for ex-
ample refs.[17] and [5]), a background zero point ﬁeld (ZPF) or Prigogine’s
quantum vacuum was considered, our of which elementary particles, typically
pions were ﬂuctuationally created - the energy of the ZPF within the pion
Compton wavelength being the rest energy of the pion.
We could turn the perspective around and consider the creation of the univer-
sal black hole instead, at the scaled ”Compton” wavelength of the universe,
as given by equation (11). It would then appear that the structure forma-
tion of the universe would be due to, as Mandelbrot pointed out, a curdling
process (cf.ref.[11] and [28]).
Indeed, we are prisoners of perspective: the following analogy would clarify.
Let us consider the drawing on (two dimensional) paper of a (three dimen-
sional) match box or rectangular parallelopiped. There are two rectangles -
the outside rectangle and the inside one. Depending on which of these we
start with, the match box would be either going inwards or coming outwards,
two totally diﬀerent possibilities.
(iii) Given equations like (6), (11) and subsequent considerations of Section
2, it would be natural to expect the universe to be a ”wave packet”, though
not in the spirit of Hawking[29]. We can see that this is indeed so. Infact for
a Gaussian wave packet[30], we have,

where, now, R and T denote the radius and age of the universe (at a given
time), M its mass and σ

R is the spread of the wave packet.

Remembering that R

width of the wave packet is the ”Compton” length. Diﬀerentiation of (15)
gives,

Equation (16) resembles Hubble’s law. We can show that this is indeed so:
Using (9), and (13), it follows from (16) that,

where the last equality has been deduced previously (cf.refs.[16, 17]) and can
be easily veriﬁed. Not only does (17) give the correct value of the Hubble con-
stant, but it is also Weinberg’s ”mysterious” empirical relation (cf.ref.[26]),
giving the pion mass in terms of the Hubble constant or vice versa.
Interestingly, from (15), using again R

cT , we can deduce that

Equation (18) and (11) are the analogues of Heisenberg’s Uncertainity Prin-

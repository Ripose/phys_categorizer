Abstract

The new information-theoretic Process Physics has shown that space is a
quantum foam system with gravity being, in eﬀect, an inhomogeneous in-ﬂow
of the quantum foam into matter. The theory predicts that absolute motion
with respect to this system should be observable, and it is shown here that
absolute motion has been detected in at least seven experiments. As well this
experimental data also reveals the existence of a gravitational wave phenomena
associated with the in-ﬂow. It is shown that Galilean Relativity and Special
Relativity are in fact compatible, contrary to current beliefs: absolute motion
actually causes the special relativity eﬀects. The new theory of gravity passes
all the tests of the previous Newtonian and General Relativity theories, but
in addition resolves the numerous gravitational anomalies such as the spiral
galaxy ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, the absence of ‘dark matter’ in elliptical galaxies,
the inconsistencies in measuring G, the borehole g anomaly, and others. It is
shown that Newtonian gravity is deeply ﬂawed, because the solar system from
which it was developed has too high a spherical symmetry to have revealed key
aspects of the phenomena of gravity, and that General Relativity inherited these
ﬂaws. The data are revealing that space has structure, and so indicates for the
ﬁrst time evidence of quantum space and quantum gravity eﬀects.

Keywords: Quantum foam, in-ﬂow gravity, absolute motion, gravitational

The new information-theoretic Process Physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] provides
for the ﬁrst time an explanation of space as a quantum foam system in which
gravity is an inhomogeneous ﬂow of the quantum foam into matter. That work
has implied that absolute motion should be observable and that gravity is caused
by an eﬀective inhomogeneous in-ﬂow of quantum-foam/space into matter. It

2

is shown here that Newtonian gravity and General Relativity may be re-written
in a ‘ﬂuid in-ﬂow’ formalism, and that a simple generalisation of this formalism
leads to a new theory of gravity, at the classical level, that is in better agreement
with the experimental data. It passes all the standard tests of both the Newto-
nian and the General Relativity theories of gravity. Signiﬁcantly this new theory
of gravity is shown to resolve the many gravitational anomalies that have been
reported - the spiral galaxy ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, the absence of ‘dark matter’
in elliptical galaxies, the ongoing inconsistencies in measuring G, the borehole
g anomalies and many others. These anomalies, as it is now becoming clear,
were revealing deep ﬂaws in the Newtonian and General Relativity formalisms.
It turns out that Newtonian gravity is ﬂawed because in its initial formulation
the phenomena of the solar system were too special - the solar system has too
much spherical symmetry to have revealed all the aspects of gravity. General
Relativity, in turn, is seen to be also ﬂawed, because it ‘inherited’ these ﬂaws
from the Newtonian theory. As well the new theory of gravity predicts a new
kind a gravitational wave, essentially turbulence in the in-ﬂowing space, and
this phenomena is evident in the experimental data. As well it is shown that
Galilean Relativity and the Lorentzian Relativity are actually consistent, and
together describe real physical phenomena - until now they were regarded as
mutually exclusive. Overall we see that the quantum foam system that is space
is more complex and subtle than the models and paradigms of current physics.
These developments indicate that we are seeing for the ﬁrst time evidence of
quantum space and quantum gravity eﬀects - the experimental data is revealing
that space has ‘structure’.

An analysis herein of data from seven experiments reveals that absolute mo-
tion relative to space has been observed by Michelson and Morley (1887) [10],
Miller (1925/26) [11], Illingworth (1927) [12], Joos (1930) [13], Jaseja et al.
(1963) [14], Torr and Kolen (1981) [15], and by DeWitte (1991) [16], contrary
to common belief within physics that absolute motion has never been observed.
The ﬁrst ﬁve of these were Michelson interferometer experiments operating with
a gas, while the last two were coaxial cable RF travel-time experiments using
atomic clocks. Amazingly no-one had ever analysed the fringe shift data from
the interferometer experiments using two well-known but overlooked key eﬀects;
namely the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect and the refractive index eﬀect
which slows down the speed of light in the gas. The Dayton Miller data also
reveals the in-ﬂow of space into the sun which manifests as gravity. The exper-
imental data of Miller, DeWitte, and Torr and Kolen indicate that the in-ﬂow
manifests turbulence, which amounts to the observation of a gravitational wave
phenomena.

Absolute motion is consistent with special relativistic eﬀects, which are
caused by actual dynamical eﬀects of absolute motion through the quantum
foam. The Lorentzian interpretation of relativistic eﬀects is seen to be essen-
tially correct. Vacuum Michelson interferometer experiments or its equivalent
[18, 19, 20, 21] cannot detect absolute motion. The various gas-mode Michelson
interferometer data cannot be analysed unless the special relativistic eﬀects are
taken into account, and indeed these experiments demonstrate the validity and

3

reality of the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect.

2 A New Theory of Gravity

2.1 Classical Eﬀects of Quantum Foam In-Flow

We begin here the analysis that reveals the new theory and explanation of grav-
ity. In this theory gravitational eﬀects are caused solely by an inhomogeneous
‘ﬂow’ of the quantum foam. The new information-theoretic concepts underlying
this physics were discussed in [1, 2, 5]. Essentially matter eﬀectively acts as a
‘sink’ for that quantum foam. It is important to realise that this is not a ﬂow
of ‘something’ through space; rather it is ongoing structural changes in space
- a ﬂuctuating and classicalising quantum foam, but with those changes most
easily described as a ‘ﬂow’, though such a ﬂow is only evident from distributed
observers. The Newtonian theory of gravity was based on observations of plan-
etary motion within the solar system. It turns out that the solar system was
too special, as the planets acted as test objects in orbit about a spherically sym-
metric matter distribution - the sun. As soon as we depart from such spherical
symmetry, and even within a spherically symmetric matter distribution prob-
lems appear. Only the numerous, so-far unexplained, gravitational anomalies
are actually providing clues as the the real nature of gravity. The Newtonian
theory was originally formulated in terms of a force ﬁeld, the gravitational ac-
celeration g(r, t), but as will be shown here it is much closer to the truth if we
re-formulate it as a ‘ﬂuid-ﬂow’ system. The gravitational acceleration g in the
Newtonian theory is determined by the matter density ρ(r, t) according to

.g =

4πGρ.

This ‘ﬂuid ﬂow’ system has wave-like solutions, in general, but these waves do
not manifest as a force via g. But, as we shall see later, the ﬂow velocity ﬁeld
v is observable, and the experimental data reveals not only v but this wave
phenomenon. In the generalisation of (5), namely (47), the wave phenomenon
does aﬀect g. There is experimental evidence that this eﬀect has also been
observed, as discussed in sect.2.10. Of course within the ﬂuid ﬂow interpretation
(4) and (5) are together equivalent to the Universal Inverse Square Law for
Gravity. Indeed for a spherically symmetric distribution of matter of total mass
M the stationary velocity ﬁeld outside of the matter

satisﬁes (5) and reproduces the inverse square law form for g using (4):

As we shall see of the many new eﬀects predicted by the generalisation of
(5) one is that this ‘Inverse Square Law’ is only valid outside of spherically
symmetric matter systems. Then, for example, the ‘Inverse Square Law’ is
expected to be inapplicable to spiral galaxies. The incorrect assumption of
the universal validity of this law led to the notion of ‘dark matter’ in order to
reconcile the faster observed rotation velocities of matter within such galaxies
compared to that predicted by the above law.

To arrive at the new in-ﬂow theory of gravity we require that the velocity ﬁeld
v(r, t) be speciﬁed and measurable with respect to a suitable frame of reference.
We shall use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frame of reference for
that purpose [22]. Then a ‘test object’ has velocity v0(t) = dr0(t)/dt with
respect to that CMB frame, where r0(t) is the position of the object wrt that
frame. We then deﬁne

vR(t) = v0(t)

v(r0(t), t),

−

(8)

as the velocity of the test object relative to the quantum foam at the location
of the object.

Process Physics [1] leads to the Lorentzian interpretation of so called ‘rela-
tivistic eﬀects’. This means that the speed of light is only ‘c’ with respect to
the quantum-foam system, and that time dilation eﬀects for clocks and length
contraction eﬀects for rods are caused by the motion of clocks and rods relative

5

to the quantum foam. So these eﬀects are real dynamical eﬀects caused by the
quantum foam, and are not to be interpreted as spacetime eﬀects as suggested
by Einstein. To arrive at the dynamical description of the various eﬀects of
the quantum foam we shall introduce conjectures that essentially lead to a phe-
nomenological description of these eﬀects. In the future we expect to be able
to derive this dynamics directly from the Quantum Homotopic Field Theory
formalism [2] that emerges from the information-theoretic system.

First we shall conjecture that the path of an object through an inhomoge-
neous and time-varying quantum-foam is determined by a variational principle,
namely the path r0(t) minimises the travel time

which is the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν [23, 24] for GR. All of the
above is very suggestive that useful information for the ﬂow dynamics may be
obtained from GR by restricting the choice of metric to the Panlev´e-Gullstrand
form. We emphasize that the absolute velocity vR has been measured, and so
the foundations of GR as usually stated are invalid. As we shall now see the GR
formalism involves two phenomena, namely (i) the use of an unnecessarily re-
strictive Einstein measurement protocol and (ii) the Lorentzian quantum-foam
dynamical eﬀects. Later we shall remove this measurement protocol from GR
and discover that the GR formalism reduces to explicit ﬂuid ﬂow equations.
However to understand the GR formalism we need to explicitly introduce the
troublesome Einstein measurement protocol and the peculiar eﬀects that it in-
duces in the observers historical records.

7

2.2 The Einstein Measurement Protocol

The quantum foam, it is argued, induces actual dynamical time dilations and
length contractions in agreement with the Lorentz interpretation of special rel-
ativistic eﬀects. Then observers in uniform motion ‘through’ the foam will on
measurement of the speed of light obtain always the same numerical value c.
To see this explicitly consider how various observers P, P ′, .. moving with diﬀer-
ent speeds through the foam, measure the speed of light. They each acquire a
standard rod and an accompanying standardised clock. That means that these
standard rods would agree if they were brought together, and at rest with re-
spect to the quantum foam they would all have length ∆l0, and similarly for
the clocks. Observer P and accompanying rod are both moving at speed vR
relative to the quantum foam, with the rod longitudinal to that motion. P then
measures the time ∆tR, with the clock at end A of the rod, for a light pulse to
travel from end A to the other end B and back again to A. The light travels at
speed c relative to the quantum-foam. Let the time taken for the light pulse to
travel from A
A be tBA, as measured by a clock at
→
rest with respect to the quantum foam1. The length of the rod moving at speed
vR is contracted to

B be tAB and from B

→

In moving from A to B the light must travel an extra distance because the end
B travels a distance vRtAB in this time, thus the total distance that must be
traversed is

Similarly on returning from B to A the light must travel the distance

Then for the moving observer the speed of light is deﬁned as the distance the

to the accompanying clock (∆tR), namely 2∆l0/∆tR = c. So the speed vR of the

observer through the quantum foam is not revealed by this procedure, and the
observer is erroneously led to the conclusion that the speed of light is always c.
This follows from two or more observers in manifest relative motion all obtaining
the same speed c by this procedure. Despite this failure this special eﬀect is
actually the basis of the spacetime Einstein measurement protocol. That this
protocol is blind to the absolute motion has led to enormous confusion within
physics.

To be explicit the Einstein measurement protocol actually inadvertently uses
this special eﬀect by using the radar method for assigning historical spacetime
coordinates to an event: the observer records the time of emission and reception
of radar pulses (tr > te) travelling through the space of quantum foam, and then
retrospectively assigns the time and distance of a distant event B according to
(ignoring directional information for simplicity)

TB =

(tr + te), DB =

(24)

where each observer is now using the same numerical value of c. The event
B is then plotted as a point in an individual geometrical construct by each
observer, known as a spacetime record, with coordinates (DB, TB). This is no
diﬀerent to an historian recording events according to some agreed protocol.
Unlike historians, who don’t confuse history books with reality, physicists do
so. We now show that because of this protocol and the quantum foam dynamical
eﬀects, observers will discover on comparing their historical records of the same
events that the expression

protocol (24), so long as both are suﬃciently small compared with the scale of
inhomogeneities in the velocity ﬁeld.

To conﬁrm the invariant nature of the construct in (25) one must pay careful
attention to observational times as distinct from protocol times and distances,
and this must be done separately for each observer. This can be tedious. We
now demonstrate this for the situation illustrated in Fig.1.

and so the construction (25) is an invariant.

While so far we have only established the invariance of the construct (25)
when one of the observers is at rest wrt to the quantum foam, it follows that
for two observers P ′ and P ′′ both in motion wrt the quantum foam it follows
that they also agree on the invariance of (25). This is easily seen by using the
intermediate step of a stationary observer P :

Hence the protocol and Lorentzian eﬀects result in the construction in (25)
being indeed an invariant in general. This is a remarkable and subtle result. For
Einstein this invariance was a fundamental assumption, but here it is a derived
result, but one which is nevertheless deeply misleading. Explicitly indicating

2.3 The Origins of General Relativity

Above it was seen that the Lorentz symmetry of the spacetime construct would
arise if the quantum foam system that forms space aﬀects the rods and clocks
used by observers in the manner indicated. The eﬀects of absolute motion with
respect to this quantum foam are in fact easily observed, and so the velocity
vR of each observer is measurable. However if we work only with the space-
time construct then the eﬀects of the absolute motion are hidden. Einstein was
very much misled by the reporting of the experiment by Michelson and Mor-
ley of 1887, as now it is apparent that this experiment, and others since then,
revealed evidence of absolute motion. The misunderstanding of the Michelson-
Morley experiment had a major eﬀect on the subsequent development of physics.
One such development was the work of Hilbert and Einstein in ﬁnding an ap-
parent generalisation of Newtonian gravity to take into account the apparent
absence of absolute motion. Despite the deep error in this work the ﬁnal for-
mulation, known as General Relativity, has had a number of successes including
the perihelion precession of mercury, the bending of light and gravitational red
shift. Hence despite the incorrect treatment of absolute motion the formalism
of general relativity apparently has some validity. In the next section we shall
deconstruct this formalism to discover its underlying physics, but here we ﬁrst
brieﬂy outline the GR formalism.

The spacetime construct is a static geometrical non-processing historical
record, and is nothing more than a very reﬁned history book, with the shape of
the manifold encoded in a metric tensor gµν(x). However in a formal treatment
by Einstein the SR formalism and later the GR formalism is seen to arise from
three fundamental assumptions:

(1) The laws of physics have the same form in all

inertial reference frames.

(2) Light propagates through empty space with a

deﬁnite speed c independent of the speed of the

source or observer.

(3)

In the limit of low speeds the new formalism
should agree with Newtonian gravity.

(30)

There is strong experimental evidence that all three of these assumptions
are in fact wrong (except for the 2nd part of (2)). Nevertheless there is some-
thing that is partially correct within the formalism, and that part needs to

11

be extracted and saved, with the rest discarded. From the above assump-
tions Hilbert and Einstein guessed the equation which specifes the metric tensor

with the velocity ﬁeld given exactly by the Newtonian form in (6). In which
case the trajectory equation (34) of test objects in the Schwarzschild metric is
equivalent to solving (14). Thus the minimisation (35) is equivalent to that of
(9). This choice of coordinates corresponds to a particular frame of reference in
which the test object has velocity vR = v
v0 relative to the in-ﬂow ﬁeld v, as
seen in (9).

−

It is conventional wisdom for practitioners in General Relativity to regard
the choice of coordinates or frame of reference to be entirely arbitrary and having
no physical signiﬁcance: no observations should be possible that can detect and
measure vR. This ‘wisdom’ is based on two beliefs (i) that all attempts to
detect vR, namely the detection of absolute motion, have failed, and that (ii)
the existence of absolute motion is incompatible with the many successes of
both the Special Theory of Relativity and of the General Theory of Relativity.
Both of these beliefs are demonstrably false.

The results in this section suggest, just as for Newtonian gravity, that the
Einstein General Relativity is nothing more than the dynamical equations for a
velocity ﬂow ﬁeld v(r, t). Hence the spacetime construct appears to be merely
an unnecessary artifact of the Einstein measurement protocol, which in turn
was motivated by the mis-reporting of the results of the Michelson-Morley ex-
periment. The successes of General Relativity should thus be considered as an
insight into the ﬂuid ﬂow dynamics of the quantum foam system, rather than
any conﬁrmation of the validity of the spacetime formalism. In the next sec-
tion we shall deconstruct General Relativity to extract a possible form for this
dynamics.

2.4 Deconstruction of General Relativity

Here we deconstruct the formalism of General Relativity by removing the obscu-
riﬁcation produced by the unnecessarily restricted Einstein measurement proto-
col. To do this we adopt the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν as that
corresponding to the observable quantum foam system, namely to an observa-
tionally detected special frame of reference. This form for the metric involves a
general velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) where for precision we consider the coordinates r, t
as that of observers at rest with respect to the CMB frame. Note that in this
frame v(r, t) is not necessarily zero, for mass acts as a sink for the ﬂow. We
therefore merely substitute the metric

dτ 2 = gµν dxµdxν = dt2

v(r(t), t)dt)2,

(39)

into (31) using (33) and (32). This metric involves the arbitrary time-dependent
velocity ﬁeld v(r, t). This is a very tedious computation and the results below
were obtained by using the symbolic mathematics capabilities of Mathematica.

In vacuum, with Tµν = 0, we ﬁnd from (31) and (40) that Gµν = 0 implies that
Gµν = 0. It is then easy to check that the in-ﬂow velocity ﬁeld (6) satisﬁes these
equations. This simply expresses the previous observation that this ‘Newtonian
in-ﬂow’ is completely equivalent to the Schwarzschild metric. We note that the
Gµν = 0 do not involve the speed of light; it appears only
vacuum equations
in (40). It is therefore suggested that (40) amounts to the separation of the
Einstein measurement protocol, which involves c, from the supposed dynamics
of gravity within the GR formalism, and which does not involve c. However the
details of the vacuum dynamics in (41) have not actually been tested. All the
key tests of GR are now seen to amount to a test only of δτ [x]/δxµ = 0, which
is the minimisation of (9), when the in-ﬂow ﬁeld is given by (40), and which is
nothing more than Newtonian gravity. Of course Newtonian gravity was itself
merely based upon observations within the solar system, and this may have
been too special to have revealed key aspects of gravity. Hence, despite popular
opinion, the GR formalism is apparently based upon rather poor evidence.

2.5 The New Theory of Gravity

Despite the limited insight into gravity which GR is now seen to amount to,
here we look for possible generalisations of Newtonian gravity and its in-ﬂow

14

interpretation by examining some of the mathematical structures that have
arisen in (41). For the case of zero vorticity
v = 0 we have Ωij = 0 and also
u where u(r, t) is a scalar ﬁeld, and only one equation
that we may write v =
is required to determine u. To that end we consider the trace of
Gij. Note that
tr(D) =

with δ = 1. However GR via (41) also stipulates that 1
tr(D2)) = 0 in
vacuum, implying that overall δ = 0 in GR. So (47) with δ
= 0 is not equivalent
to GR. Nevertheless this is seen to be a possible generalisation of the Newtonian
equation (5) that includes the new term C(v) = δ
tr(D2)). It appears
that the existence and signiﬁcance of this new term has gone unnoticed for some
300 years. Its presence explains the many known gravitational anomalies, as we
shall see. Eqn.(47) describes the ﬂow of space and its self-interaction. The
value of δ should be determined from both the underlying theory and also by
analysis of experimental data; see Sects.2.9 and 2.11. We also note that because
of the C(v) term G does not necessarily have the same value as the value GN
determined by say Cavendish type experiments.

4 ((trD)2

−

−

The most signiﬁcant aspect of (47) is that the new term C(v) = 0 only for
the in-ﬂow velocity ﬁeld in (6), namely only outside of a spherically symmetric
matter distribution.

Hence (47) in the case of the solar system is indistinguishable from Newto-
nian gravity, or the Schwarzschild metric within the General Relativity formal-
ism so long as we use (9), in being able to determine trajectories of test objects.
Hence (47) is automatically in agreement with most of the so-called checks on
Newtonian gravity and later General Relativity. Note that (47) does not involve
the speed of light c. Nevertheless we have not derived (47)) from the underlying
Quantum Homotopic Field Theory, and indeed it is not a consequence of GR,
as the
G00 equation of (41) requires that C(v) = 0 in vacuum. Eqn.(47) at this
stage should be regarded as a conjecture which will permit the exploration of
possible quantum-ﬂow physics and also allow comparison with experiment.

However one key aspect of (47) should be noted here, namely that being a
non-linear ﬂuid-ﬂow dynamical system we would expect the ﬂow to be turbu-
lent, particularly when the matter is not spherically symmetric or inside even

15

6
a spherically symmetric distribution of matter, since then the C(v) term is
non-zero and it will drive that turbulence. We see that the experiments that
reveal absolute motion also reveal evidence of such turbulence - a new form of
gravitational wave predicted by the new theory of gravity.

2.6 The ‘Dark Matter’ Eﬀect

Because of the C(v) term (47) would predict that the Newtonian inverse square
law would not be applicable to systems such as spiral galaxies, because of their
highly non-spherical distribution of matter. Of course attempts to retain this
law, despite its manifest failure, has led to the spurious introduction of the
notion of dark matter within spiral galaxies, and also at larger scales. From

g =

which is (4) for irrotational ﬂow, we see that (47) gives

and writing the extra term as <C(v)>= 4πGρDM we see that ρDM would act
as an eﬀective matter density, and it is suggested that it is the consequences
of this term which have been misinterpreted as ‘dark matter’. Here we see
that this eﬀect is actually the consequence of quantum foam eﬀects within the
new proposed dynamics for gravity, and which becomes apparent particularly
in spiral galaxies. Because

v = 0 we can write (47) in the form

which allows the determination of the time evolution of v.

In practice it is easier to compute the vortex-free velocity ﬁeld from a velocity

Hence the Φ ﬁeld acts as the source term for the velocity potential. Note
that in the Newtonian theory of gravity one has the choice of using either the
acceleration ﬁeld g or the velocity ﬁeld v. However in the new theory of gravity
this choice is no longer available: the fundamental dynamical degree of freedom
is necessarily the v ﬁeld, again because of the presence of the C(v) term, which
obviously cannot be written in terms of g.

The new ﬂow dynamics encompassed in (47) thus accounts for most of the
known gravitational phenomena, but will lead to some very clear cut experi-
ments that will distinguish it from the two previous attempts to model gravita-
tion. It turns out that these two attempts were based on some key ‘accidents’ of
history. In the case of the Newtonian modelling of gravity the prime ‘accident’
was of course the solar system with its high degree of spherical symmetry. In
each case we had test objects, namely the planets, in orbit about the sun, or we
had test object in orbit about the earth. In the case of the General Relativity
modelling the prime ‘accident’ was the mis-reporting of the Michelson-Morley
experiment, and the ongoing belief that the so called ‘relativistic eﬀects’ are
incompatible with absolute motion, and of course that GR was constructed to
agree with Newtonian gravity in the ‘non-relativistic’ limit, and so ‘inherited’
the ﬂaws of that theory. We shall consider in detail later some further anoma-
lies that might be appropriately explained by this new modelling of gravity. Of
course that the in-ﬂow has been present in various experimental data is also a
signiﬁcant argument for something like (47) to model gravity.

2.7

In-Flow Superposition Approximation

We consider here why the existence of absolute motion and as well the conse-
quences and so the presence of the C(v) term appears to have escaped attention
in the case of gravitational experiments and observations near the earth, despite
the fact, in the case of the C(v) term, that the presence of the earth breaks the
spherical symmetry of the matter distribution of the sun.

First note that if we have a matter distribution ρ(r) at rest in the space of
quantum foam, and that (47) has solution v0(r, t), with g0(r, t) given by (48),
then when the same matter distribution is uniformly translating at velocity V,
that is ρ(r)

Vt), then a solution to (47) is

ρ(r

→

−

v(r, t) = v0(r

Vt, t) + V.

−

(54)

Note that this is a manifestly time-dependent process and the time derivative in
(4) or (14) and (47) plays an essential role. As well the result is nontrivial as (47)
is a non-linear equation. The solution (54) follows because (i) the expression
for the accelerationg(r, t) gives, and this expression occurs in (47),

as there is a key cancellation of two terms in (55), and (ii) clearly C(v0(r

Vt, t) + V) = C(v0(r
Hence apart from the translation eﬀect the acceleration is the same. Hence the
velocity vector addition rule in (54) is valid for generating the vector ﬂow ﬁeld
for the translating matter distribution. This is why the large absolute motion
velocity of some 400 km/s of the solar system does not interfere with the usual
computation and observation of gravitational forces.

−

→

For earth based gravitational phenomena the motion of the earth takes place
within the velocity in-ﬂow towards the sun, and the velocity sum rule (54) is only
V(r, t) and no longer corresponds to uniform
approximately valid as now V
translation, and manifests turbulence. To be a valid approximation the inhomo-
geneity of V(r, t) must be much smaller than that of v0(r
Vt, t), which it is, as
the earth’s centripetal acceleration about the sun is approximately 1/1000 that
of the earth’s gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth. Neverthe-
less turbulence associated with the C(v) term is apparent in experimental data.
The validity of this approximation demonstrates that the detection of a cosmic
absolute motion and the in-ﬂow theory of gravity are consistent with the older
methods of computing gravitational forces. This is why both the presence of the
C(v) term, the in-ﬂow and the absolute motion have gone almost unnoticed in
earth based gravitational experiments, except for various anomalies; see section
2.9.

−

2.8 Gravitational In-Flow and the GPS

It has been extensively argued that the very successful operation of the Global
Positioning System (GPS) [26] is proof of the validity of the General Relativity
formalism for gravity. However as is well known, and was most clearly stated
by Popper, in science agreement with observation does not amount to the proof
of the theory used to successfully describe the experimental data; in fact exper-
iment can only strictly be used to disprove a theory.

We show here that the new in-ﬂow theory of gravity together with the ob-
served absolute velocity of motion of the solar system through space are together
compatible with the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Given
the developments above this turns out to be an almost trivial exercise. As usual
in this system the eﬀects of the sun and moon are neglected. Various eﬀects
need to be included as the system relies upon extremely accurate atomic clocks
in the satellites forming the GPS constellation. Within both the new theory
and General Relativity these clocks are aﬀected by both their speed and the
gravitational eﬀects of the earth. As well the orbits of these satellites and the
critical time delays of radio signals from the satellites need to be computed.
For the moment we assume spherical symmetry for the earth. The eﬀects of
In General Relativity the orbits and
non-sphericity will be discussed below.

18

signalling time delays are determined by the use of the geodesic equation (34)
and the Schwarzschild metric (36). However these two equations are equivalent
to the orbital equation (16) and the velocity ﬁeld (54), with a velocity V of
absolute motion, and with the in-ﬂow given by (6), noting the result in section
2.7. For EM signalling the elapsed time in (9) requires careful treatment. Hence
the two systems are completely mathematically equivalent: the computations
within the new system may most easily be considered by relating them to the
mathematically equivalent General Relativity formalism. We can also see this
by explicitly changing from the CMB frame to a non-rotating frame co-moving
with the earth by means of the change of variables

which lead to the relationships of diﬀerentials

(57)

These expressions then lead to the demonstration of the invariance of (47). Then
in the earth co-moving frame the absolute velocity V does not appear in (47).
Then another change of variables, as in (37), permits (47) to be written in the
form of General Relativity with a Schwarzschild metric.

The consistency between the absolute motion velocity V and General Rela-
tivity may also be directly checked by showing explicitly, using say Mathematica,
that the metric

−

((v(r

Vt) + V)dt)2,

c2 (dr(t)
is a solution to (31) for Tµν = 0, ie outside matter, where v(r) is the in-ﬂow
velocity ﬁeld in (6). This metric is a generalisation of the Panlev´e-Gullstrand
metric to include the absolute motion eﬀect. This emphasises yet again that for
a spherically symmetric matter distribution the Schwarzschild metric, which is
equivalent to the Panlev´e-Gullstrand metric, is physically identical to Newtonian
gravity.

(58)

−

−

There are nevertheless two diﬀerences between the two theories. One is their
diﬀerent treatment of the non-sphericity of the earth via the C(v) term, and the
second diﬀerence is the eﬀects of the in-ﬂow turbulence. In the operation of the
GPS the density ρ(r) of the earth is not used. Rather the gravitational potential
Φ(r) is determined observationally. In the new gravity theory the determination
2 v2(r) would involve the
of such a gravitational potential via (47) and Φ(r) =
extra C(v) term. Hence because of this phenomenological treatment the eﬀects
of the C(v) term are not checkable. However the gravitational wave eﬀect is
expected to aﬀect the operation of the GPS, and the GPS constellation would

−

1

19

oﬀer a worldwide network which would enable the investigation of the spatial
and temporal correlations of these gravitational waves.

There is also a signiﬁcant interpretational diﬀerence between the two theo-
ries. For example in General Relativity the relativistic eﬀects involve both the
‘special relativity’ orbital speed eﬀect via time dilations of the satellite clocks
together with the General Relativity ‘gravitational potential energy’ eﬀect on
the satellite clocks. In the new theory there is only one eﬀect, namely the time
dilation eﬀect produced by the motion of the clocks through the quantum foam,
and the speeds of these clocks involve the vector sum of the orbital velocity and
the velocity caused by the in-ﬂow of the quantum foam into the earth.

The relations in (57) are those of Galilean Relativity. However together with
these go the real absolute motion eﬀects of time dilations and length contractions
for moving material systems. Then the data from observers in absolute motion
may be related by the Lorentz transformation, so long as their data is not
corrected for the eﬀects of absolute motion. So the new Process Physics brings
together transformations that were, in the past, regarded as mutually exclusive.

As noted in Sect.2.1 Newton’s Inverse Square Law of Gravitation is strictly valid
only in cases of spherical symmetry, and then only outside of such a matter dis-
tribution. The theory that gravitational eﬀects arise from inhomogeneities in
the quantum foam ﬂow implies that there is no ‘universal law of gravitation’
because the inhomogeneities are determined by non-linear ‘ﬂuid equations’ and
the solutions have no form which could be described by a ‘universal law’. Fun-
damentally there is no generic ﬂuid ﬂow behaviour. The Inverse Square Law is
then only an approximation, with large deviations expected in the case of spiral
galaxies. Nevertheless Newton’s gravitational constant G will have a deﬁnite
value as it quantiﬁes the eﬀective rate at which matter dissipates the informa-
tion content of space.

From these considerations it follows that the measurement of the value of G
will be diﬃcult as the measurement of the forces between two of more objects,
which is the usual method of measuring G, will depend on the geometry of
the spatial positioning of these objects in a way not previously accounted for
because the Newtonian Inverse Square Law has always been assumed, or in
some cases a speciﬁed change in the form of the law has been used. But in
all cases a ‘law’ has been assumed, and this may have been the ﬂaw in the
analysis of data from such experiments. This implies that the value of G from
such experiments will show some variability as a systematic eﬀect has been
neglected in analysing the experimental data, for in none of these experiments
is spherical symmetry present. So experimental measurements of G should show
an unexpected contextuality. As well the inﬂuence of surrounding matter has
also not been properly accounted for. Of course any eﬀects of turbulence in the
inhomogeneities of the ﬂow has presumably never even been contemplated.

The ﬁrst measurement of G was in 1798 by Cavendish using a torsional
balance. As the precision of experiments increased over the years and a variety
of techniques used the disparity between the values of G has actually increased,
as shown in Fig.2, and as reviewed in [51].
In 1998 CODATA increased the
uncertainty in G from 0.013% to 0.15%. One indication of the contextuality
is that measurements of G produce values that diﬀer by nearly 40 times their
individual error estimates . It is predicted that these G anomalies will only be
resolved when the new theory of gravity is used in analysing the data from these
experiments.

2.10 Gravitational Anomalies

In Sect.2.9 anomalies associated with the measurement of G were brieﬂy dis-
cussed and it was pointed out that these were probably explainable within the
new in-ﬂow theory of gravity. There are in-fact additional gravitational anoma-
lies that are not well-known in physics, presumably because their existence is
incompatible with the Newtonian or the Hilbert-Einstein gravity theories.

21

The most signiﬁcant of these anomalies is the Allais eﬀect [53].

In June
1954 Allais3 reported that a Foucault pendulum exhibited peculiar movements
at the time of a solar eclipse. Allais was recording the precession of a Foucault
pendulum in Paris. Coincidently during the 30 day observation period a partial
solar eclipse occurred at Paris on June 30. During the eclipse the precession of
the pendulum was seen to be disturbed. Similar results were obtained during
another solar eclipse on October 29 1959. There have been other repeats of the
Allais experiment with varying results.

Another anomaly was reported by Saxl and Allen [54] during the solar eclipse
of March 7 1970. Signiﬁcant variations in the period of a torsional pendulum
were observed both during the eclipse and as well in the hours just preceding
and just following the eclipse. The eﬀects seem to suggest that an “apparent
wavelike structure has been observed over the course of many years at our
Harvard laboratory”, where the wavelike structure is present and reproducible
even in the absence of an eclipse.

Again Zhou and Huang [55, 56, 57] report various time anomalies occurring
during the solar eclipses of September 23 1987, March 18 1988 and July 22 1990
observed using atomic clocks.

Another anomaly is associated with the rotational velocities of objects in spi-
ral galaxies, which are larger than could be maintained by the apparent amount
of matter in such galaxies. This anomaly led to the introduction of the ‘dark
matter’ concept - but with no such matter ever having been detected, despite
extensive searches. This anomaly was compounded when recently observations
of the rotational velocities of objects within elliptical galaxies was seen to re-
quire very little ‘dark matter’ [58]. Of course this is a simple consequence of
the new theory of gravity. The ‘dark matter’ eﬀect is nothing more than an
aspect of the self-interaction of space that is absent in both the Newtonian and
General Relativity theories. As a system becomes closer to being spherically
symmetric, such as in the transition from spiral to elliptical galaxies, the new
C(v) term becomes less eﬀective.

All these anomalies, including the g anomaly in sect.2.11, and others such
as the Pioneer 10/11 de-acceleration anomaly [59] and the solar neutrino ﬂux
deﬁciency problem, not discussed here, would suggest that gravity has aspects
to it that are not within the prevailing theories, but that the in-ﬂow theory
discussed above might well provide an explanation, and indeed these anomalies
may well provide further phenomena that could be used to test the new theory.
The eﬀects associated with the solar eclipses could presumably follow from the
alignment of the sun, moon and the earth causing enhanced turbulence. The
Saxl and Allen experiment of course suggests, like the other experiments, that
the turbulence is always present. To explore these anomalies detailed numerical
studies of (47) are required with particular emphasis on the eﬀect on the position
of the moon.

gInF low from solving (59) and (60) for a density ρ = 2760 kg/m3 appropriate to the
Hilton mine, a coeﬃcient δ = 1 and G = 0.99925GN .

Stacey and others [60, 61, 63] have found evidence for non-Newtonian grav-
itation from gravimetric measurements (Airy experiments) in mines and bore-
holes. The discovery was that the measured value of g down mines and boreholes
became greater than that predicted by the Newtonian theory, given the den-
sity proﬁle ρ(r) implied by sampling, and so implying a defect in Newtonian
gravity, as shown in Fig.3 for the Hilton mine. The results were interpreted
and analysed using either a value of G diﬀerent to but larger than that found in
laboratory experiments or by assuming a short range Yukawa type force in addi-
tion to the Newtonian ‘inverse-square law’. Numerous experiments were carried
out in which g was measured as a function of depth, and also as a function of
height above ground level using towers. The tower experiments [64, 65] did not
indicate any non-Newtonian eﬀect, and so implied that the extra Yukawa force
explanation was not viable. The combined results appeared to have resulted in
confusion and eventually the experimental eﬀect was dismissed as being caused
by erroneous density sampling [66]. However the new theory of gravity predicts
such an eﬀect, and in particular that the eﬀect should manifest within the earth
but not above it, as was in fact observed. Essentially this eﬀect is caused by the
new C(v) term in the in-ﬂow theory of gravity which, as we have noted earlier,
is active whenever there is a lack of complete spherical symmetry, or even within
matter when there is spherical symmetry - this being the case here.

It is important to note that the value of G is not necessarily the same as the
conventional value denoted as GN . Both of these equations may be integrated
in from the surface, assuming that the in-ﬂow velocity ﬁeld at or above the
surface is given by

so that it corresponds to the observed surface value of g.
In (59) M is the
total matter content of the earth, but in (60) M is the sum of the matter
content and the eﬀective total ‘dark matter’ content of the earth. Then above
the surface, where ρ = 0, both ﬂow equations have (61) as identical solutions,
since for this velocity ﬁeld the additional bracketed term in (60) is identically
zero. This explains why the tower experiments found no non-Newtonian eﬀects.
The in-ﬂow equations may be numerically integrated inward from the surface
using as boundary conditions the continuity of v(r) and v′(r) at the surface.
For each the g(r) is determined. Fig.3 shows the resulting diﬀerence ∆g(r) =

gobserved. Assuming δ = 1 the value of G was adjusted to agree with the data,
giving G = 0.99925GN, as shown in Fig.3. However this ﬁt does not uniquely
determine the values of δ and G.
It should be noted that the data in Fig.3
was adjusted for density irregularities using Newtonian gravity, and this is now
seen to be an invalid procedure. Nevertheless the results imply that a repeat of
the borehole measurements would be very useful in contributing to the testing
of the new theory of gravity, or perhaps even a re-analysis of existing data
could be possible. The key signature of the eﬀect, as shown in Fig.3, is the
discontinuity in d∆g(r)/dr at the surface, and which is a consequence of having
the C(v) term. Of course using a Yukawa force added to Newtonian gravity
cannot produce this key signature, as such a force results in d∆g(r)/dr being
continuous at the surface.

3 Detection of Absolute Motion and Gravita-

tional Waves

3.1 Space and Absolute Motion

Absolute motion is motion relative to space itself. It turns out that Michelson
and Morley in their historic experiment of 1887 did detect absolute motion,
but rejected their own ﬁndings because using their method of analysis of the
observed fringe shifts the determined speed of some 8 km/s was less than the 30
km/s orbital speed of the earth. The data was clearly indicating that the theory
for the operation of the Michelson interferometer was not adequate. Rather than
reaching this conclusion Michelson and Morley came to the incorrect conclusion
that their results amounted to the failure to detect absolute motion. This had
an enormous impact on the development of physics, for as is well known Ein-
stein adopted the absence of absolute motion eﬀects as one of his fundamental
assumptions. By the time Miller had ﬁnally ﬁgured out how to work around the
lack of a viable theory for the operation of the Michelson interferometer, and
properly analyse data from his own Michelson interferometer, absolute motion
had become a forbidden concept within physics, as it still is at present. The ex-
perimental observations by Miller and others of absolute motion has continued
to be scorned and rejected by the physics community. Fortunately as well as re-
vealing absolute motion the experimental data also reveals evidence in support
of a new theory of gravity.

3.2 Theory of the Michelson Interferometer

We now show for the ﬁrst time in over 100 years how three key eﬀects together
permit the Michelson interferometer [17] to reveal the phenomenon of absolute
motion when operating in the presence of a gas, with the third eﬀect only
discovered in 2002 [8]. The main outcome is the derivation of the origin of the
Miller k2 factor in the expression for the time diﬀerence for light travelling via
the orthogonal arms,

∆t = k2 L

(62)

Here vP is the projection of the absolute velocity v of the interferometer through
the quantum-foam onto the plane of the interferometer, where the projected ve-
locity vector vP has azimuth angle ψ relative to the local meridian, and θ is the
angle of one arm from that meridian. The k2 factor is k2 = n(n2
1) where n
is the refractive index of the gas through which the light passes, L is the length
of each arm and c is the speed of light relative to the quantum foam. This
expression follows from three key eﬀects: (i) the diﬀerence in geometrical length
of the two paths when the interferometer is in absolute motion, as ﬁrst realised

A. D is a quantum detector (not drawn in (b)) that causes localisation of the pho-
ton state by a collapse process. In (a) the interferometer is at rest in space. In (b)
the interferometer is moving with speed v relative to space in the direction indicated.
Interference fringes are observed at the quantum detector D. If the interferometer is
rotated in the plane through 90o, the roles of arms AC and AB are interchanged, and
during the rotation shifts of the fringes are seen in the case of absolute motion, but
only if the apparatus operates in a gas. By counting fringe changes the speed v may
be determined.

by Michelson, (ii) the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction of the arms along the di-
rection of motion, and (iii) that these two eﬀects precisely cancel in vacuum, but
leave a residual eﬀect if operated in a gas, because the speed of light through the
gas is reduced to V = c/n, ignoring here for simplicity any Fresnel-drag eﬀects.
This is one of the aspects of the quantum foam physics that distinguishes it
from the Einstein formalism. The time diﬀerence ∆t is revealed by the fringe
shifts on rotating the interferometer.
In Newtonian physics, that is with no
Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction, k2 = n3, while in Einsteinian physics k = 0
reﬂecting the fundamental assumption that absolute motion is not measurable
and indeed has no meaning. So the experimentally determined value of k is a
key test of fundamental physics. For air n = 1.00029, and so for process physics
k = 0.0241 and k2 = 0.00058, which is close to the Einsteinian value of k = 0,
particularly in comparison to the Newtonian value of k = 1.0. This small but
non-zero k value explains why the Michelson interferometer experiments gave
such small fringe shifts. Fortunately it is possible to check the n dependence of
k as two experiments [12, 13] were done in helium gas, and this has an n2
1
value signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of air.

−

In deriving (63) in the new physics it is essential to note that space is a
quantum-foam system which exhibits various subtle features. In particular it
exhibits real dynamical eﬀects on clocks and rods. In this physics the speed
of light is only c relative to the quantum-foam, but to observers moving with
respect to this quantum-foam the speed appears to be still c, but only because
their clocks and rods are aﬀected by the quantum-foam. As shown in above such
observers will ﬁnd that records of observations of distant events will be described
by the Einstein spacetime formalism, but only if they restrict measurements to

26

those achieved by using clocks, rods and light pulses, that is using the Einstein
measurement protocol. However if they use an absolute motion detector then
such observers can correct for these eﬀects.

It is simplest in the new physics to work in the quantum-foam frame of
reference. If there is a gas present at rest in this frame, such as air, then the
speed of light in this frame is V = c/n. If the interferometer and gas are moving
with respect to the quantum foam, as in the case of an interferometer attached
to the earth, then the speed of light relative to the quantum-foam is still V = c/n
up to corrections due to drag eﬀects. Hence this new physics requires a diﬀerent
method of analysis from that of the Einstein physics. With these cautions we
now describe the operation of a Michelson interferometer in this new physics,
and show that it makes predictions diﬀerent to that of the Einstein physics. Of
course experimental evidence is the ﬁnal arbiter in this conﬂict of theories.

As shown in Fig.5 the beamsplitter/mirror when at A sends a photon ψ(t)
into a superposition ψ(t) = ψ1(t) + ψ2(t), with each component travelling in
diﬀerent arms of the interferometer, until they are recombined in the quantum
detector which results in a localisation process, and one spot in the detector is
produced. Repeating with many photons reveals that the interference between
ψ1 and ψ2 at the detector results in fringes. These fringes actually only appear if
the mirrors are not quite orthogonal, otherwise the screen has a uniform intensity
and this intensity changes as the interferometer is rotated, as shown in the
analysis by Hicks [25]. To simplify the analysis here assume that the two arms
are constructed to have the same lengths L when they are physically parallel
to each other and perpendicular to v, so that the distance BB′ is L sin(θ).
The Fitzgerald-Lorentz eﬀect in the new physics is that the distance SB′ is
γ−1L cos(θ) where γ = 1/
v2/c2. The various other distances are AB =
V tAB, BC = V tBC , AS = vtAB and SC = vtBC , where tAB and tBC are the
travel times. Applying the Pythagoras theorem to triangle ABB′ we obtain

if v = 0, but also ∆t = 0 when v
= 0 but only if V = c. This then would result
in a null result on rotating the apparatus. Hence the null result of Michelson
interferometer experiments in the new physics is only for the special case of
photons travelling in vacuum for which V = c. However if the interferometer is
immersed in a gas then V < c and a non-null eﬀect is expected on rotating the

apparatus, since now ∆t
for this refractive index eﬀect. The above ∆t is the change in travel time when
one arm is moved through angle θ. The interferometer operates by comparing
the change in the diﬀerence of the travel times between the arms. Then for
V = c/n we ﬁnd for v << V that

that is k2 = n(n2
1), which gives k = 0 for vacuum experiments (n = 1).
So the Miller phenomenological parameter k is seen to accommodate both the
Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect and the dielectric eﬀect, at least for gases.
This is very fortunate since being a multiplicative parameter a re-scaling of old
analyses is all that is required. ∆t is non-zero when n
= 1 because the refractive
index eﬀect results in incomplete cancellation of the geometrical eﬀect and the
Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect. Of course it was this cancellation eﬀect
that Fitzgerald and Lorentz actually used to arrive at the length contraction
hypothesis, but they failed to take the next step and note that the cancellation

mode. That denies these experiments the opportunity to see absolute motion
eﬀects. Nevertheless the experimentalists continue to misinterpret their null
results as evidence against absolute motion. Of course these experiments are
therefore restricted to merely checking the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect,
and this is itself of some interest.

All data from gas-mode interferometer experiments, except for that of Miller,
has been incorrectly analysed using only the ﬁrst eﬀect as in Michelson’s initial
theoretical treatment, and so the consequences of the other two eﬀects have
been absent. Repeating the above analysis without these two eﬀects we arrive
at the Newtonian-physics time diﬀerence which, for v << V , is
∆t = Ln3 v2

(66)

that is k2 = n3. The value of ∆t, which is typically of order 10−17s in gas-
mode interferometers corresponding to a fractional fringe shift, is deduced from
analysing the fringe shifts, and then the speed vM has been extracted using (66),
instead of the correct form (65) or more generally (63). However it is very easy
to correct for this oversight. From (65) and (66) we obtain for the corrected
absolute (projected) speed vP through space, and for n

For air the correction factor in (67) is signiﬁcant, and even more so for helium.

3.3 The Michelson-Morley Experiment: 1887

Michelson and Morley reported that their interferometer experiment in 1887
gave a ‘null-result’ which since then, with rare exceptions, has been claimed to
support the Einstein assumption that absolute motion has no meaning. However
to the contrary the Michelson-Morley published data [10] shows non-null eﬀects,
but much smaller than they expected. They made observations of thirty-six 3600
turns using an L = 11 meter length interferometer, achieved using multiple
reﬂections, operating in air in Cleveland (Latitude 41030′N) with six turns near
12 :00 hrs (7:00 hrs ST) on each day of July 8, 9 and 11, 1887 and similarly near
18 :00 hrs (13:00 hrs ST) on July 8, 9 and 12, 1887. Each turn took approximately
6 minutes as the interferometer slowly rotated ﬂoating on a tank of mercury.
They published and analysed the average of each of the 6 data sets. The fringe
shifts were extremely small but within their observational capabilities.

Table 2 shows examples of the averaged fringe shift micrometer readings
every 22.50 of rotation of the Michelson-Morley interferometer [10] for July 11
12:00 hr local time and also for July 9 18:00 hr local time. The orientation
of the stone slab base is indicated by the marks 16, 1, 2, ... North is mark 16.
The dominant eﬀect was a uniform fringe drift caused by temporal temperature
eﬀects on the length of the arms, and imposed upon that are the fringe shifts
corresponding to the eﬀects of absolute motion, as shown in Fig.6.

This temperature eﬀect can be removed by subtracting from the data in each

case a best ﬁt to the data of a + bk,

part of each rotation data set. Then multiplying by 0.02 for the micrometer
thread calibration gives the fringe-shift data points in Fig.8. This factor of
0.02 converts the micrometer readings to fringe shifts expressed as fractions of
a wavelength. Similarly a linear ﬁt has been made to the data from the 1800 to
3600 part of each rotation data set. Separating the full 3600 rotation into two
1800 parts reduces the eﬀect of the temperature drift not being perfectly linear
in time.

In the new physics there are four main velocities that contribute to the total

velocity:

v = vcosmic + vtangent −

vin −

vE.

(68)

Here vcosmic is the velocity of the solar system relative to some cosmologically
deﬁned galactic quantum-foam system (discussed later) while the other three
are local eﬀects: (i) vtangent is the tangential orbital velocity of the earth about
the sun, (ii) vin is a quantum-gravity radial in-ﬂow of the quantum foam past
the earth towards the sun, and (iii) the corresponding quantum-foam in-ﬂow
into the earth is vE and makes no contribution to a horizontally operated in-
terferometer, assuming the velocity superposition approximation, and also that
the turbulence associated with that ﬂow is not signiﬁcant. The minus signs in

30

(68) arise because, for example, the in-ﬂow towards the sun requires the earth
to have an outward directed velocity against that in-ﬂow in order to maintain
a ﬁxed distance from the sun, as shown in Fig.7. For circular orbits and using
in-ﬂow form of Newtonian gravity the speeds vtangent and vin are given by

while the net speed vR of the earth from the vector sum vR = vtangent −

where M is the mass of the sun, R is the distance of the earth from the sun,
and G is Newton’s gravitational constant. G is essentially a measure of the rate
at which matter eﬀectively ‘dissipates’ the quantum-foam. The gravitational
acceleration arises from inhomogeneities in the ﬂow. These expressions give
vtangent = 30km/s, vin = 42.4km/s and vR = 52km/s.

The magnitude of the theoretical curves are in general in good agreement with
the magnitudes of the experimental data, excluding those cases where the data
does not have the sinusoidal form. However there are signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in
the azimuth angle. These ﬂuctuations are also present in the Miller data, and
together suggest that this is a real physical phenomenon, and not solely due to
diﬃculties with the operation of the interferometer.

×

The Michelson-Morley interferometer data clearly shows the characteristic
sinusoidal form with period 1800 together with a large speed. Ignoring the eﬀect
of the refractive index, namely using the Newtonian value of k = 1, gives speeds
reduced by the factor kair, namely kairvP = 0.0241
330km/s = 7.9 km/s.
Michelson and Morley reported speeds in the range 5km/s - 7.5km/s. These
slightly smaller speeds arise because they averaged all the 7:00 hr (ST) data,
and separately all the 13:00 hr (ST) data, whereas here some of the lower quality
data have not been used. Michelson was led to the false conclusion that because
this speed of some 8 km/s was considerably less than the orbital speed of 30
km/s the interferometer must have failed to have detected absolute motion, and
that the data was merely caused by experimental imperfections. This was the
ﬂawed analysis that led to the incorrect conclusion by Michelson and Morley
that the experiment had failed to detect absolute motion. The consequences for
physics were extremely damaging, and are only now being rectiﬁed after some
115 years.

3.4 The Miller Interferometer Experiment: 1925-1926

Dayton Miller developed and operated a Michelson interferometer for over twenty
years, with the main sequence of observations being on Mt.Wilson in the years
1925-1926, with the results reported in 1933 by Miller [11]. Accounts of the
Miller experiments are available in Swenson [52]. Miller developed his huge in-
terferometer over the years, from 1902 to 1906, in collaboration with Morley,
and later at Mt.Wilson where the most extensive interferometer observations
were carried out. Miller was meticulous in perfecting the operation of the in-
terferometer and performed many control experiments. The biggest problem to
be controlled was the eﬀect of temperature changes on the lengths of the arms.
It was essential that the temperature eﬀects were kept as small as possible, but
so long as each turn was performed suﬃciently quickly, any temperature eﬀect
could be assumed to have been linear with respect to the angle of rotation. Then
a uniform background fringe drift could be removed, as in the Michelson-Morley
data analysis (see Fig.6).

In all some 200,000 readings were taken during some 12,000 turns of the
interferometer4. Analysis of the data requires the extraction of the speed vM
4In a remarkable development in 2002 as a result of a visit by James DeMeo to Case
Western Reserve University the original Miller data was located, some 61 years after Miller’s
death in 1941. Until then it was thought that the data had been destroyed. Analysis of that

33

and the azimuth angle ψ by eﬀectively ﬁtting the observed time diﬀerences,
obtained from the observed fringe shifts, using (63), but with k = 1. Miller was
of course unaware of the full theory of the interferometer and so he assumed
the Newtonian theory, which neglected both the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction
and air eﬀects.

2

−

Miller performed his observations in April, August and September 1925 and
February 1926 and the data is shown in Figs.9 and 11. The speeds shown are
the Michelson speeds vM , and these are easily corrected for the two neglected
eﬀects by dividing these vM by kair = √(n2
1) = 0.0241, as in (67). Then
for example a speed of vM = 10km/s gives vP = vM /kair = 415km/s. However
this correction procedure was not available to Miller. He understood that the
theory of the Michelson interferometer was not complete, and so he introduced
the phenomenological parameter k in (63). We shall denote his values by k.
Miller noted, in fact, that k
<< 1, as we would now expect. Miller then
proceeded on the assumption that v should have only two components: (i) a
cosmic velocity of the solar system through space, and (ii) the orbital velocity of
the earth about the sun. Over a year this vector sum would result in a changing
v, as was in fact observed. Further, since the orbital speed was known, Miller
was able to extract from the data the magnitude and direction of v as the
orbital speed oﬀered an absolute scale. For example the dip in the vM plots for
16hr is a clear indication of the direction of v, as the dip
sidereal times τ
arises at those sidereal times when the projection vP of v onto the plane of the
interferometer is at a minimum. During a 24hr period the value of vP varies
due to the earth’s rotation. As well the vM plots vary throughout the year
because the vectorial sum of the earth’s orbital velocity vtangent and the cosmic
velocity vcosmic changes. There are two eﬀects here as the direction of vtangent
is determined by both the yearly progression of the earth in its orbit about the
sun, and also because the plane of the ecliptic is inclined at 23.50 to the celestial
plane. Figs.9 and 11 show the expected theoretical variation of both vP and the
azimuth ψ during one sidereal day in the months of April, August, September
and February. These plots show the clear signature of absolute motion eﬀects
as seen in the actual interferometer data.

≈

Note that the above corrected Miller projected absolute speed of approxi-
mately vP = 415km/s is completely consistent with the corrected projected ab-
solute speed of some 330km/s from the Michelson-Morley experiment, though
neither Michelson nor Miller were able to apply this correction. The diﬀerence
in magnitude is completely explained by Cleveland having a higher latitude
than Mt. Wilson, and also by the only two sidereal times of the Michelson-
Morley observations. So from his 1925-1926 observations Miller had completely
conﬁrmed the true validity of the Michelson-Morley observations and was able
to conclude, contrary to their published conclusions, that the 1887 experiment
had in fact detected absolute motion. But it was too late. By then the physi-
cists had incorrectly come to believe that absolute motion was inconsistent with

data by the author of this article has conﬁrmed the accuracy of Miller’s analysis. Using more
thorough computer based techniques the data is now being re-analysed.

various ‘relativistic eﬀects’ that had by then been observed. This was because
the Einstein formalism had been ‘derived’ from the assumption that absolute
motion was without meaning and so unobservable in principle. Of course the
earlier interpretation of relativistic eﬀects by Lorentz had by then lost out to
the Einstein interpretation.

3.5 Gravitational In-ﬂow from the Miller Data

As already noted Miller was led to the conclusion that for reasons unknown
the existing theory of the Michelson interferometer did not reveal true values
of vP , and for this reason he introduced the parameter k, with k indicating his
numerical values. Miller had reasoned that he could determine both vcosmic and
k by observing the interferometer determined vP and ψ over a year because the
known orbital velocity of the earth about the sunwould modulate both of these

36

vcosmic|
|

observables, and by a scaling argument he could determine the absolute velocity
of the solar system. In this manner he ﬁnally determined that
= 208
70033′). However now that the theory
km/s in the direction (α = 4hr54m, δ =
−
of the Michelson interferometer has been revealed an anomaly becomes appar-
ent. Table 3 shows v = vM /kair for each of the four epochs, giving speeds
consistent with the revised Michelson-Morley data. However Table 3 also shows
that k and the speeds v = vM /k determined by the scaling argument are consid-
erably diﬀerent. Here the vM values arise after taking account of the projection
eﬀect. That k is considerably larger than the value of kair indicates that an-
other velocity component has been overlooked. Miller of course only knew of
the tangential orbital speed of the earth, whereas the new physics predicts that
as-well there is a quantum-gravity radial in-ﬂow vin of the quantum foam. We
can re-analyse Miller’s data to extract a ﬁrst approximation to the speed of this
in-ﬂow component. Clearly it is vR =
tangent that sets the scale and
q
not vtangent, and because k = vM /vtangent and kair = vM /vR are the scaling
relations, then

Using the k values in Table 3 and the value5 of kair we obtain the vin speeds
shown in Table 3, which give an average speed of 54 km/s, compared to the
‘Newtonian’ in-ﬂow speed of 42 km/s. Note that the in-ﬂow interpretation of
the anomaly predicts that k = (vR/vtangent) kair = √3 kair = 0.042. Of course
this simple re-scaling of the Miller results is not completely valid because (i) the
direction of vR is of course diﬀerent to that of vtangent, and also not necessarily
orthogonal to vtangent because of turbulence, and (ii) also because of turbulence
we would expect some contribution from the in-ﬂow eﬀect of the earth itself,
namely that it is not always perpendicular to the earth’s surface, and so would
give a contribution to a horizontally operated interferometer.

An analysis that properly searches for the in-ﬂow velocity eﬀect clearly re-
quires a complete re-analysis of the Miller data, and this is now possible and
underway at Flinders University as the original data sheets have been found.
It should be noted that the direction approximately diametrically opposite

resolved by using the seasonal motion of the earth. However as Miller did not

might give this northerly direction as the direction of absolute motion of the
solar system.

Hence not only did Miller observe absolute motion, as he claimed, but the
quality and quantity of his data has also enabled the conﬁrmation of the exis-
tence of the gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect. This is a manifestation of a new theory
of gravity and one which relates to quantum gravitational eﬀects via the uniﬁ-
cation of matter and space. As well the persistent evidence that this in-ﬂow is
turbulent indicates that this theory of gravity involves self-interaction of space
itself.

3.6 The Illingworth Experiment: 1927

In 1927 Illingworth [12] performed a Michelson interferometer experiment in
which the light beams passed through the gas helium,

...as it has such a low index of refraction that variations due to
temperature changes are reduced to a negligible quantity.

For helium at STP n = 1.000036 and so k2
He = 0.00007, which results in an enor-

gives an excellent opportunity to check the n dependence in (67). Illingworth,
not surprisingly, reported no “ether drift to an accuracy of about one kilometer
per second”. M´unera [?] re-analysed the Illingworth data to obtain a speed

So the use by Illingworth of helium gas, and also by Joos, has turned out have
oﬀered a fortuitous opportunity to conﬁrm the validity of the refractive index
eﬀect, though because of the insensitivity of this experiment the resulting error
range is signiﬁcantly larger than those of the other interferometer observations.
So ﬁnally it is seen that the Illingworth experiment detected absolute motion
with a speed consistent with all other observations.

The results (1)-(3) are not corrected for the ±30km/s of the orbital motion of the

were made for (4) with the speeds from Table 3. The horizontal line at v = 369km/s
is to aid comparisons with the CMB frame speed data. The Miller direction is dif-
ferent to the CMB direction. Due to the angle between the velocity vector and the
plane of interferometer the results (1)-(3) are less than or equal to the true speed,
while the result for (4) is the true speed as this projection eﬀect was included in the
analysis. These results demonstrate the remarkable consistency between the three in-
terferometer experiments. The Miller speed agrees with the speed from the DeWitte
non-interferometer experiment, in Sect.3.9. The lower data, magniﬁed by a factor of
5, are the original speeds vM determined from fringe shifts using (62) with k = 1. This

3.7 The Joos Experiment: 1930

Joos set out to construct and operate a large vacuum Michelson interferometer
at the Zeiss Works in Jena, Germany 1930 [13]. This interferometer had an
eﬀective arm length of 10.5m achieved using multiple refections in each arm.
The vacuum sealing was ineﬀective and the penetration of air into the vacuum
vessel caused problematic vibrations. Subsequently Joos used helium, assuming
apparently that helium could be considered as a substitute for a true vacuum6.
The use of helium is not mentioned in the Joos paper [13], but is mentioned by
Swenson [52]. Joos recorded the fringe shifts photographically, and subsequently
analysed the images using a photometer. The data for 22 rotations throughout
the day of May 30, 1930 are shown in Fig.14, and are reproduced from Fig.11
of [13]. From that data Joos concluded, using an analysis that did not take
account of the special relativistic length contraction eﬀect, that the fringe shifts
corresponded to a speed of only 1.5 km/s. However as previously noted such
an analysis is completely ﬂawed. As well the data in Fig.14 shows that for all
but one of the rotations the fringe shifts were poorly recorded. Only in the one
rotation, at 11 2358, does the data actually look like the form expected. This
is probably not accidental as the maximum fringe shift was expected at that
time, based on the Miller direction of absolute motion, and the sensitivity of the
device was
1 thousandth of a fringe shift. In Fig.15 that one rotation data is
compared with the form expected for Jena on May 30 using the Miller speed and
direction together with the new refractive index eﬀect,and using the refractive
index of helium. The agreement is quite remarkable. So again contrary the
Joos paper and to subsequent commentators Joos did in fact detect a very large
velocity of absolute motion.

3.8 The New Bedford Experiment: 1963

In 1964 from an absolute motion detector experiment at New Bedford, latitude
420N, Jaseja et al [14] reported yet another ‘null result’. In this experiment two
He-Ne masers were mounted with axes perpendicular on a rotating table, see
Fig.16. Rotation of the table through 900 produced repeatable variations in the
frequency diﬀerence of about 275kHz, an eﬀect attributed to magnetorestriction
in the Invar spacers due to the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Observations over some
six consecutive hours on January 20, 1963 from 6:00 am to 12:00 noon local
time did produce a ‘dip’ in the frequency diﬀerence of some 3kHz superimposed
on the 275kHz eﬀect, as shown in Fig.17 in which the local times have been
converted to sidereal times. The most noticeable feature is that the dip occurs
10:00 hrs local time), which
at approximately 17
agrees with the direction of absolute motion observed by Miller and also by
DeWitte (see Sect.3.9). It was most fortunate that this particular time period
was chosen as at other times the eﬀect is much smaller, as shown for example
for the February data in Fig.9 which shows the minimum at 18:00hr sidereal
time. The local times were chosen by Jaseja et al such that if the only motion
was due to the earth’s orbital speed the maximum frequency diﬀerence, on
rotation, should have occurred at 12:00hr local time, and the minimum frequency
diﬀerence at 6:00 hr local time, whereas in fact the minimum frequency diﬀerence
occurred at 9:00 hr local time.

As for the Michelson-Morley experiment the analysis of the New Bedford
experiment was also bungled. Again this apparatus can only detect the ef-
fects of absolute motion if the cancellation between the geometrical eﬀects and
Fitzgerald-Lorentz length contraction eﬀects is incomplete as occurs only when
the radiation travels in a gas, here the He-Ne gas present in the maser.

This double maser apparatus is essentially equivalent to a Michelson inter-
ferometer. Then the resonant frequency ν of each maser is proportional to the

nian analysis of the Michelson interferometer itself. Of course the very small
magnitude of the absolute motion eﬀect, which was approximately 1/1000 that
expected assuming only an orbital speed of v = 30 km/s in the Newtonian anal-
ysis, occurs simply because the refractive index of the He-Ne gas is very close
to one7. Nevertheless given that it is small the sidereal time of the obvious ’dip’
coincides almost exactly with that of the other observations of absolute motion.
The New Bedford experiment was yet another missed opportunity to have
revealed the existence of absolute motion. Again the spurious argument was that

Figure 17: Frequency diﬀerence in kHz between the two masers in the 1963 New
Bedford experiment after a 900 rotation. The 275kHz diﬀerence is a systematic re-
peatable apparatus eﬀect, whereas the superimposed ‘dip’ at 17 − 18:00hr sidereal time
of approximately 3kHz is a real time dependent frequency diﬀerence. The full curve
shows the theoretical prediction for the time of the ‘dip’ for this experiment using the
Miller direction for ˆv (α = 5.2hr, δ = −670) with |v| = 433km/s and including the
earth’s orbital velocity and sun gravitational in-ﬂow velocity eﬀects for January 20,
1963. The absolute scale of this theoretical prediction was not possible to compute as
the refractive index of the He-Ne gas mixture was unknown.

because the Newtonian physics analysis gave the wrong prediction then Einstein
relativity must be correct. But the analysis simply failed to take account of the
Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction, which had been known since the end of the 19th
century, and the refractive index eﬀect which had an even longer history. As
well the authors failed to convert their local times to sidereal times and compare
the time for the ‘dip’ with Miller’s time8.

3.9 The DeWitte Experiment: 1991

The Michelson-Morley, Illingworth, Miller, Joos and New Bedford experiments
all used Michelson interferometers or its equivalent in gas mode, and all revealed
absolute motion. The Michelson interferometer is a 2nd-order device meaning
that the time diﬀerence between the ‘arms’ is proportional to (v/c)2. There is
also a factor of n2
1 and for gases like air and particularly helium or helium-
neon mixes this results in very small time diﬀerences and so these experiments
were always very diﬃcult. Of course without the gas the Michelson interferom-
eter is incapable of detecting absolute motion9, and so there are fundamental
limitations to the use of this interferometer in the study of absolute motion and
related eﬀects.

−

In a remarkable development in 1991 a research project within Belgacom, the
Belgium telecommunications company, stumbled across yet another detection of

travel 1.5 km through a coaxial cable between Rue du Marais and Rue de la Paille,
Brussels. An oﬀset has been used such that the average is zero. The deﬁnition of
the sign convention for ∆t used by DeWitte is unclear. The cable has a North-South
orientation, and the data is ± diﬀerence of the travel times for NS and SN propagation.
The sidereal time for maximum eﬀect of ∼17hr (or ∼5hr) (indicated by vertical lines)
agrees with the direction found by Miller and also by Jaseja et al, but because of the
ambiguity in the deﬁnition of ∆t the opposite direction would also be consistent with
this data. Plot shows data over 3 sidereal days and is plotted against sidereal time.

absolute motion, and one which turned out to be 1st-order in v/c. The study was
undertaken by Roland DeWitte [16]. This organisation had two sets of atomic
clocks in two buildings in Brussels separated by 1.5 km and the research project
was an investigation of the task of synchronising these two clusters of atomic
clocks. To that end 5MHz radiofrequency signals were sent in both directions
through two buried coaxial cables linking the two clusters. The atomic clocks
were caesium beam atomic clocks, and there were three in each cluster.
In
that way the stability of the clocks could be established and monitored. One
cluster was in a building on Rue du Marais and the second cluster was due
south in a building on Rue de la Paille. Digital phase comparators were used to
measure changes in times between clocks within the same cluster and also in the
propagation times of the RF signals. Time diﬀerences between clocks within the
same cluster showed a linear phase drift caused by the clocks not having exactly
the same frequency together with short term and long term noise. However the
long term drift was very linear and reproducible, and that drift could be allowed
for in analysing time diﬀerences in the propagation times between the clusters.
Changes in propagation times were observed and eventually observations
over 178 days were recorded. A sample of the data, plotted against sidereal time
for just three days, is shown in Fig.18. DeWitte recognised that the data was
evidence of absolute motion but he was unaware of the Miller experiment and
did not realise that the Right Ascension for maximum/minimum propagation
time agreed almost exactly with Miller’s direction (α, δ) = (5.2h,

fact DeWitte expected that the direction of absolute motion should have been
in the CMB direction, but that would have given the data a totally diﬀerent
sidereal time signature, namely the times for maximum/minimum would have
been shifted by 6 hrs. The declination of the velocity observed in this DeWitte
experiment cannot be determined from the data as only three days of data are
available. However assuming exactly the same declination as Miller the speed
observed by DeWitte appears to be also in excellent agreement with the Miller
speed, which in turn is in agreement with that from the Michelson-Morley and
Illingworth experiments, as shown in Fig.13.

Being 1st-order in v/c the Belgacom experiment is easily analysed to suﬃ-
cient accuracy by ignoring relativistic eﬀects, which are 2nd-order in v/c. Let
the projection of the absolute velocity vector v onto the direction of the coaxial
cable be vP as before. Then the phase comparators reveal the diﬀerence between
the propagation times in NS and SN directions. Consider the analysis with no

The actual days of the data in Fig.18 are not revealed in Ref.[16] so a detailed
analysis of the DeWitte data is not possible. Nevertheless theoretical predictions
for various days in a year are shown in Fig.19 using the Miller speed of vcosmic =
433 km/s and where the diurnal eﬀects of the earth’s orbital velocity and the
gravitational in-ﬂow cause the range of variation of ∆t and sidereal time of

data, giving an average slope of 3.92 minutes/day. The time diﬀerence between a
sidereal day and a solar day is 3.93 minutes/day. This demonstrates that the eﬀect is
related to sidereal time and not local solar time. The actual days of the year are not
identiﬁed in Ref.[16]. Adapted from DeWitte [16].

local solar time. A least squares best ﬁt of a linear relation to that data gives
that the cross-over time is retarded, on average, by 3.92 minutes per solar day.
This is to be compared with the fact that a sidereal day is 3.93 minutes shorter
than a solar day. So the eﬀect is certainly cosmological and not associated with
any daily thermal eﬀects, which in any case would be very small as the cable is
buried. Miller had also compared his data against sidereal time and established
the same property, namely that up to small diurnal eﬀects identiﬁable with the
earth’s orbital motion, features in the data tracked sidereal time and not solar
time; see Ref.[11] for a detailed analysis.

The DeWitte data is also capable of resolving the question of the absolute
670) or the
direction of motion found by Miller. Is the direction (α, δ) = (5.2h,
opposite direction? By doing a 2nd-order Michelson interferometer experiment
Miller had to rely on the earth’s diurnal eﬀects in order to resolve this ambiguity,
but his analysis of course did not take account of the gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect,
and so until a re-analysis of his data his preferred choice of direction must remain
to be conﬁrmed. The DeWitte experiment could easily resolve this ambiguity
by simply noting the sign of ∆t. Unfortunately it is unclear in Ref.[16] as to how
the sign in Fig.18 is actually deﬁned, and DeWitte does not report a direction
expecting, as he did, that the direction should have been the same as the CMB
direction.

−

The DeWitte observations were truly remarkable considering that initially
they were serendipitous. They demonstrated yet again that the Einstein pos-
tulates were in contradiction with experiment. To my knowledge no physics
journal has published a report of the DeWitte experiment.

That the DeWitte experiment is not a gas-mode Michelson interferometer
experiment is very signiﬁcant. The value of the speed of absolute motion re-

speeds revealed by the new analysis of various Michelson interferometer data,
which used the recently discovered refractive index eﬀect, see Fig.13. Not only
was this eﬀect conﬁrmed by comparing results for diﬀerent gases, but the re-
scaling of the older vM speeds to v = vM /√n2
1 speeds resulting from this
eﬀect are now conﬁrmed.

3.10 The Torr-Kolen Experiment: 1981

A coaxial cable experiment similar to but before the DeWitte experiment was
performed at the University of Utah in 1981 by Torr and Kolen [15]. This
involved two rubidium vapor clocks placed approximately 500m apart with a 5
MHz sinewave RF signal propagating between the clocks via a nitrogen ﬁlled
coaxial cable maintained at a constant pressure of
2 psi. This means that the
Fresnel drag eﬀect is not important in this experiment. Unfortunately the cable
was orientated in an East-West direction which is not a favourable orientation
for observing absolute motion in the Miller direction, unlike the Brussels North-
South cable orientation. There is no reference to Miller’s result in the Torr and
Kolen paper, otherwise they would presumably not have used this orientation.
Nevertheless there is a projection of the absolute motion velocity onto the East-
West cable and Torr and Kolen did observe an eﬀect in that, while the round
speed time remained constant within 0.0001%c, typical variations in the one-
way travel time were observed, as shown in Fig.21 by the data points. The
theoretical predictions for the Torr-Kolen experiment for a cosmic speed of 433

km/s in the direction (α, δ) = (5.2h,

velocities, are shown in Fig.21. As well the maximum eﬀect occurred, typically,
at the predicted times. So the results of this experiment are also in remarkable
agreement with the Miller direction, and the speed of 433 km/s which of course
only arises after re-scaling the Miller speeds for the eﬀects of the gravitational
in-ﬂow. As well Torr and Kolen reported ﬂuctuations in both the magnitude
and time of the maximum variations in travel time just as DeWitte observed
some 10 years later. Again we argue that these ﬂuctuations are evidence of
genuine turbulence in the in-ﬂow as discussed in Sect.3.12. So the Torr-Kolen
experiment again shows strong evidence for the new theory of gravity, and which
is over and above its conﬁrmation of the various observations of absolute motion.

3.11 Galactic In-ﬂow and the CMB Frame

−

−

Absolute motion (AM) of the solar system has been observed in the direction
670), up to an overall sign to be sorted out, with a speed of
(α, δ) = (5.2h,
433 km/s. This is the velocity after removing the contribution of the earth’s
orbital speed and the sun in-ﬂow eﬀect.
It is signiﬁcant that this velocity is
diﬀerent to that associated with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
relative to which the solar system has a speed of 369 km/s in the direction
7.220), see [22]. This CMB velocity is obtained by ﬁnding
(α, δ) = (11.20h,
the preferred frame in which this thermalised 30K radiation is isotropic, that
is by removing the dipole component. The CMB velocity is a measure of the
motion of the solar system relative to the universe as a whole, or at least a
shell of the universe some 15Gyrs away, and indeed the near uniformity of
that radiation in all directions demonstrates that we may meaningfully refer
to the spatial structure of the universe. The concept here is that at the time of
decoupling of this radiation from matter that matter was on the whole, apart
from small observable ﬂuctuations, at rest with respect to the quantum-foam
system that is space. So the CMB velocity is the motion of the solar system
with respect to space universally, but not necessarily with respect to the local
space. Contributions to this velocity would arise from the orbital motion of the
solar system within the Milky Way galaxy, which has a speed of some 250 km/s,
and contributions from the motion of the Milky Way within the local cluster,
and so on to perhaps larger clusters.

On the other hand the AM velocity is a vector sum of this universal CMB
velocity and the net velocity associated with the local gravitational in-ﬂows into
the Milky Way and the local cluster. If the CMB velocity had been identical
to the AM velocity then the in-ﬂow interpretation of gravity would have been
proven wrong. We therefore have three pieces of experimental evidence for this
interpretation (i) the refractive index anomaly discussed previously in connec-
tion with the Miller data, (ii) the turbulence seen in all detections of absolute
motion, and now (iii) that the AM velocity is diﬀerent in both magnitude and
direction from that of the CMB velocity, and that this CMB velocity does not
display the turbulence seen in the AM velocity.

49

That the AM and CMB velocities are diﬀerent amounts to the discovery of
the resolution to the ‘dark matter’ conjecture. Rather than the galactic velocity
anomalies being caused by such undiscovered ‘dark matter’ we see that the
in-ﬂow into non spherical galaxies, such as the spiral Milky Way, will be non
Newtonian. As well it will be interesting to determine, at least theoretically, the
scale of turbulence expected in galactic systems, particularly as the magnitude
of the turbulence seen in the AM velocity is somewhat larger than might be
expected from the sun in-ﬂow alone. Any theory for the turbulence eﬀect will
certainly be checkable within the solar system as the time scale of this is suitable
for detailed observation.

It is also clear that the time of observers at rest with respect to the CMB
frame is absolute or universal time. This interpretation of the CMB frame has
of course always been rejected by supporters of the SR/GR formalism. As for
space we note that it has a diﬀerential structure, in that diﬀerent regions are in
relative motion. This is caused by the gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect locally, and
as well by the growth of the universe.

Figure 22: Speed ﬂuctuations determined from Fig.18 by subtracting a least squares
best ﬁt of the forms shown in Fig.19b. A 1ns variation in travel time corresponds
approximately to a speed variation of 27km/s. The larger speed ﬂuctuations actually
arise from a ﬂuctuation in the cross-over time, that is, a ﬂuctuation in the direction
of the velocity. This plot implies that the velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld is turbulent. The scale
of this turbulence is comparable to that evident in the Miller data, as shown in Fig.9
and Fig.23a.

The velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld equation is expected to have solutions possessing tur-
bulence, that is, ﬂuctuations in both the magnitude and direction of the grav-
itational in-ﬂow component of the velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld. Indeed all the Michelson
interferometer experiments showed evidence of such turbulence. The ﬁrst clear
evidence was from the Miller experiment, as shown in Figs.9 and 11. Miller of-
fered no explanation for these ﬂuctuations but in his analysis of that data he did
running time averages. Miller may have in fact have simply interpreted these

ﬂuctuations as purely instrumental eﬀects. While some of these ﬂuctuations
may be partially caused by weather related temperature and pressure varia-
tions, the bulk of the ﬂuctuations appear to be larger than expected from that
cause alone. Even the original Michelson-Morley data in Fig.8 shows variations
in the velocity ﬁeld and supports this interpretation. However it is signiﬁcant
that the non-interferometer DeWitte data also shows evidence of turbulence in
both the magnitude and direction of the velocity ﬂow ﬁeld, as shown in Fig.22.
Just as the DeWitte data agrees with the Miller data for speeds and directions
the magnitude ﬂuctuations, shown in Fig.22, are very similar in absolute magni-
tude to, for example, the Miller speed turbulence shown in Fig.23a. As well the
orientation of the Torr-Kolen coaxial cable is very sensitive to the directional
changes associated with the turbulence. Being almost at 900 to the direction
of absolute motion, any variation in that direction produces signiﬁcant eﬀects,
as shown in Fig. 23b where the declination is varied by

It therefore becomes clear that there is strong evidence from these three
experiments for these ﬂuctuations being evidence of physical turbulence in the
ﬂow ﬁeld. The magnitude of this turbulence appears to be somewhat larger than
that which would be caused by the in-ﬂow of quantum foam towards the sun, and
indeed following on from Sect.3.11 some of this turbulence may be associated
with galactic in-ﬂow into the Milky Way. This in-ﬂow turbulence is a form
of gravitational wave and the ability of gas-mode Michelson interferometers
to detect absolute motion means that experimental evidence of such a wave
phenomena has been available for a considerable period of time, but suppressed
along with the detection of absolute motion itself. Of course ﬂow equations of
the form (47) do not exhibit those gravitational waves of the form that have

been predicted to exist based on the Einstein equations, and which are supposed
to propagate at the speed of light. All this means that gravitational wave
phenomena are very easy to detect and amount to new physics that can be
studied in much detail.

3.13 Vacuum Michelson Interferometers

Over the years vacuum-mode Michelson interferometer experiments have be-
come increasing popular, although the motivation for such experiments appears
to be increasingly unclear. The ﬁrst vacuum interferometer experiment was
planned by Joos [13] in 1930, but because of technical problems helium was
actually used, as discussed in section 3.7. The ﬁrst actual vacuum experiment
was by Kennedy and Thorndike [18]. The result was actually unclear but was
consistent with a null eﬀect as predicted by both the quantum-foam physics and
the Einstein physics. Only Newtonian physics is disproved by such experiments.
These vacuum interferometer experiments do give null results, with increasing
conﬁdence level, as for example in Refs.[18, 19, 20, 21], but they only check that
the Lorentz contraction eﬀect completely cancels the geometrical path-length
eﬀect in vacuum experiments, and this is common to both theories. So they are
unable to distinguish the new physics from the Einstein physics. Nevertheless
recent works [20, 21] continue to claim that the experiment had been motivated
by the desire to look for evidence of absolute motion, despite eﬀects of absolute
motion having been discovered as long ago as 1887. The ‘null results’ are al-
ways reported as proof of the Einstein formalism. Unfortunately the analysis of
the data from such experiments is always by means of the Robertson [67] and
Mansouri and Sexl formalism [68], which purports to be a generalisation of the
Lorentz transformation if there is a preferred frame. However we have seen that
absolute motion eﬀects, that is the existence of a preferred frame, are consistent
with the usual Lorentz transformation, based as it is on the restricted Einstein
measurement protocol. A preferred frame is revealed by gas-mode Michelson
interferometer experiments, and then the refractive index of the gas plays a
critical role in interpreting the data. The Robertson and Mansouri-Sexl formal-
ism contains no contextual aspects such as a refractive index eﬀect and is thus
totally inappropriate to the analysis of so called ‘preferred frame’ experiments.
It is a curious feature of the history of Michelson interferometer experiments
that it went unnoticed that the results fell into two distinct classes, namely
vacuum and gas-mode, with recurring non-null results from gas-mode interfer-
ometers.

3.14 Solid-State Michelson Interferometers

The gas-mode Michelson interferometer has its sensitivity to absolute motion
eﬀects greatly reduced by the refractive index eﬀect, namely the k2 = n2
1
factor in (62), and for gases with n only slightly greater than one this factor
has caused much confusion over the last 115 years. So it would be expected

1.5 rather
that passing the light beams through a transparent solid with n
than through a gas would greatly increase the sensitivity. Such an Michelson
interferometer experiment was performed by Shamir and Fox [69] in Haifa in
1969. This interferometer used light from a He-Ne laser and used perspex rods
with L = 0.26m. The experiment was interpreted in terms of the supposed
1/n2. The light
Fresnel drag eﬀect, which has a drag coeﬃcient given by b = 1
passing through the solid was supposed to be ‘dragged’ along in the direction of
motion of the solid with a velocity ∆V = bv additional to the usual c/n speed.
As well the Michelson geometrical path diﬀerence and the Lorentz contraction
eﬀects were incorporated into the analysis. The outcome was that no fringe
shifts were seen on rotation of the interferometer, and Shamir and Fox concluded
that this negative result “enhances the experimental basis of special relativity”.
The Shamir-Fox experiment was unknown to us11 at Flinders university
when in 2002 several meters of optical ﬁbre were used in a Michelson interfer-
ometer experiment which also used a He-Ne laser light source. Again because
of the n2
1 factor, and even ignoring the Fresnel drag eﬀect, one would have
expected large fringe shifts on rotation of the interferometer, but none were
observed. As well in a repeat of the experiment single-mode optical ﬁbres were
also used and again with no rotation eﬀect seen. So this experiment is consistent
with the Shamir-Fox experiment. Re-doing the analysis by including the sup-
posed Fresnel drag eﬀect, as Shamir and Fox did, makes no material diﬀerence
to the expected outcome. In combination with the non-null results from the
gas-mode interferometer experiments along with the non-interferometer exper-
iment of DeWitte it is clear that transparent solids behave diﬀerently to a gas
when undergoing absolute motion through the quantum foam. Indeed this in
itself is a discovery of a new phenomena.

−

The most likely explanation is that the physical Fitzgerald-Lorentz contrac-
tion eﬀect has a anisotropic eﬀect on the refractive index of the transparent
solid, and this is such as to cause a cancellation of any diﬀerences in travel
time between the two arms on rotation of the interferometer. In this sense a
transparent solid medium shares this outcome with the vacuum itself.

3.15 Absolute Motion and Quantum Gravity

Absolute rotational motion had been recognised as a meaningful and observable
phenomenon from the very beginning of physics. Newton had used his rotating
bucket experiment to illustrate the reality of absolute rotational motion, and
later Foucault and Sagnac provided further experimental proof. But for absolute
linear motion the history would turn out to be completely diﬀerent.
It was
generally thought that absolute linear motion was undetectable, at least until
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory appeared to require it. In perhaps the most
bizarre sequence of events in modern science it turns out that absolute linear
motion has been apparent within experimental data for over 100 years. It was

chemist with considerable laser experience.

missed in the ﬁrst experiment designed to detect it and from then on for a
variety of sociological reasons it became a concept rejected by physicists and
banned from their journals despite continuing new experimental evidence. Those
who pursued the scientiﬁc evidence were treated with scorn and ridicule. Even
worse was the impasse that this obstruction of the scientiﬁc process resulted
in, namely the halting of nearly all progress in furthering our understanding
of the phenomena of gravity. For it is clear from all the experiments that
were capable of detecting absolute motion that there is present in that data
evidence of turbulence within the velocity ﬁeld. Both the in-ﬂow itself and the
turbulence are manifestations at a classical level of what is essentially quantum
gravity processes, for these processes imply that space has structure.

Process Physics has given a uniﬁcation of explanation and description of
physical phenomena based upon the limitations of formal syntactical systems
which had nevertheless achieved a remarkable encapsulation of many phenom-
ena, albeit in a disjointed and confused manner, and with a dysfunctional on-
tology attached for good measure. As argued in [2] space is a quantum system
continually classicalised by on-going non-local collapse processes. The emergent
phenomenon is foundational to existence and experientialism. Gravity in this
system is caused by diﬀerences in the rate of processing of the cellular infor-
mation within the network which we experience as space, and consequentially
there is a diﬀerential ﬂow of information which can be aﬀected by the presence
of matter or even by space itself. Of course the motion of matter including
photons with respect to that spatial information content is detectable because
it aﬀects the geometrical and chronological attributes of that matter, and the
experimental evidence for this has been exhaustively discussed above. What
has become very clear is that the phenomenon of gravity is only understandable
once we have this uniﬁcation of the quantum phenomena of matter and the
quantum phenomenon of space itself. In Process Physics the diﬀerence between
matter and space is subtle. It comes down to the diﬀerence between informa-
tional patterns that are topologically preserved and those information patterns
that are not. One outcome of this uniﬁcation is that as a consequence of having
a quantum phenomenon of space itself we obtain an informational explanation
for gravity, and which at a suitable level has an emergent quantum description.
In this sense we have an emergent quantum theory of gravity. Of course no such
quantum description of gravity is derivable from quantising Einsteinian gravity
itself. This follows on two counts, one is that the Einstein gravity formalism
fails on several levels, as discussed previously, and second that quantisation has
no validity as a means of uncovering deeper physics. Most surprising of all is
that having uncovered the logical necessity for gravitational phenomena it also
appears that even the seemingly well-founded Newtonian account of gravity has
major failings. The denial of this possibility has resulted in an unproductive
search for dark matter. Indeed like dark matter and spacetime much of present
day physics has all the hallmarks of another episode of Ptolemy’s epicycles,
namely concepts that appear to be well founded but in the end turn out to be
illusions, and ones that have acquired the status of dogma.

If the Michelson-Morley experiment had been properly analysed and the

54

phenomena revealed by the data exposed, and this would have required in 1887
that Newtonian physics be altered, then as well as the subsequent path of physics
being very diﬀerent, physicists would almost certainly have discovered both the
gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect and associated gravitational waves.

It is clear then that observation and measurement of absolute motion leads
directly to a changed paradigm regarding the nature and manifestations of grav-
itational phenomena. There are two aspects of such an experimental program.
One is the characterisation of the turbulence and its linking to the new non-
linear term in the velocity ﬁeld theory. This is a top down program. The second
aspect is a bottom-up approach where the form of the velocity ﬁeld theory, or
its modiﬁcation, is derived from the deeper informational process physics. This
is essentially the quantum gravity route. The turbulence is of course essentially
a gravitational wave phenomena and networks of 1st-order interferometers will
permit spatial and time series analysis. There are a number of other gravita-
tional anomalies which may also now be studied using such an interferometer
network, and so much new physics can be expected to be uncovered.

4 Conclusions

We have shown here that seven experiments, so far, have clearly revealed ex-
perimental evidence of absolute motion. As well these are all consistent with
respect to the direction and speed of that motion. This clearly refutes the funda-
mental postulates of the Einstein reinterpretation of the relativistic eﬀects that
had been developed earlier by Lorentz and others. Indeed these experiments
are consistent with the Lorentzian interpretation of the special relativistic ef-
fects in which reality displays both absolute motion and relativistic eﬀects. It
is absolute motion that actually causes these relativistic eﬀects. Data from the
ﬁve Michelson interferometer fringe-shift experiments had never been properly
analysed until now. That analysis requires that the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contrac-
tion eﬀect be taken into account, as well as the eﬀect of the gas on the speed
of light in the interferometer. Only then does the fringe-shift data from air and
helium interferometer experiments become consistent, and then also consistent
with the two RF coaxial cable travel-time experiments. The seasonal changes
in the Miller fringe-shift data reveal the orbital motion of the earth about the
sun, as well as an in-ﬂow of space past the earth into the sun. These results
support the new theory of gravity. As well the large cosmic velocity of the solar
system is seen to be diﬀerent to the velocity associated with the Cosmic Mi-
crowave Background, which implies another gravitational in-ﬂow, this time into
the Milky Way and Local Cluster. The fringe-shift data has also indicated the
presence of turbulence in these gravitational in-ﬂows, and this amounts to the
detection of gravitational waves. These are waves predicted by the new theory
of gravity, and not those associated with the Hilbert-Einstein theory of gravity.
As noted the Newtonian theory of gravity is deeply ﬂawed, as revealed by its
inability to explain a growing number of gravitational anomalies, but which are

55

explained by the new theory. These ﬂaws arose because the solar system was
too special, because of its high spherical symmetry, to have revealed the full
range of phenomena that is gravity. General Relativity ‘inherited’ these ﬂaws,
and so is itself ﬂawed. As discussed the clear-cut checks of General Relativity
were actually done in systems also with high spherical symmetry.

Here a new theory of gravity has been proposed. It passes all the key exist-
ing tests, including the operation of the GPS, and also appears to be capable
of explaining numerous gravitational anomalies. The phenomena present in
these anomalies provide opportunities for further tests of the new gravitational
physics, as illustrated here by the mine/borehole g anomaly. This new the-
ory explains why elliptical galaxies display a very small ‘dark matter’ eﬀect,
in comparison with the large eﬀect for the spiral galaxies. This new theory is
supported by the Miller, Torr and Kolen, and DeWitte absolute motion experi-
ments in that they reveal the turbulent in-ﬂow of space associated with gravity,
namely the discovery of those gravitational waves predicted by the new theory,
as well as the existence of absolute motion itself.

The experiments are consistent with the Lorentzian interpretation of the
special relativistic eﬀects in that reality displays both absolute motion eﬀects
and relativistic eﬀects. It is absolute motion that causes the special relativistic
eﬀects. We saw that the Galilean transformation together with the absolute
motion eﬀects of time dilations and length contractions for moving matter sys-
tems leads to the data from observers in absolute motion being related by the
Lorentz transformation, so long as their data are not corrected for the eﬀects of
absolute motion. So the new Process Physics brings together transformations
that were, in the past, regarded as mutually exclusive. Essentially the quantum
foam system that is space generates phenomena that are more subtle than cur-
rently considered in physics. Discussed in [1, 2] was an explanation for the ‘dark
energy’ phenomena, previously known as the cosmological constant, associated
with the accelerating rate of expansion of the universe - that also is seen to be
a consequence of the information theoretic aspects of the quantum foam.

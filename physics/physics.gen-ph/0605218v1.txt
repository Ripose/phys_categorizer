The CP(N-1) Aﬃne Gauge Theory in the
Dynamical Space-time

Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel

P.Leifer1

Abstract

An attempt to build quantum theory of ﬁeld (extended) objects without a
priori space-time geometry has been represented. Space-time coordinates are
replaced by the intrinsic coordinates in the tangent ﬁbre bundle over complex
projective Hilbert state space CP (N
1). The fate of quantum system mod-
−
eled by the generalized coherent states is rooted in this manifold. Dynamical
(state-dependent) space-time arises only at the stage of the quantum “yes/no”
measurement. The quantum measurement of the gauge “ﬁeld shell” of the gen-
eralized coherent state is described in terms of the aﬃne parallel transport of
the local dynamical variables in CP (N

1).

1 Introduction

The deep disagreement between general relativity and quantum theory is well known
[1]. In this work I would like represent the model of quantum geometry, intended
to reach the desirable “peaceful coexistence” between these theories. The proposed
scheme is inherently based on the notion of the relative quantum amplitudes. For-
mally, I deal with “classical” non-linear ﬁeld theory developed over the complex pro-
jective Hilbert space CP (N
1). It is worth while to emphasize, that my approach

[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] quite diﬀers from number of works using CP (N
[7, 8, 9].

1); see for example

The sketch of the proposed scheme is as follows:
a). I use the realization of the G = SU(N) acting on the states

= C N
in terms of local dynamical variables (LDV’s) represented by the tangent vectors to
CP (N

1) (the operators of diﬀerentiation).

b). Quantum measurement realized as a perturbation of the generalized coherent

−

quantum state (GCS).

c). The self-identiﬁcation of quantum system is realized by the aﬃne parallel

transport of its local dynamical variables, agrees with Fubini-Study metric.

d). Variation principle applied to the local Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld leads to quasi-
linear PDE ﬁeld equations for the “ﬁeld shell” of the GCS. This “ﬁeld shell” represents
some “quantum potential” of the model extended “particle” corresponding GCS.

e). The “yes/no” measuring process formulated as a detection of this extended
particle serving for the establishment of the local state-dependent space-time struc-
ture.

This approach leads to some conclusion concerning so-called measurement prob-

lem. It is convenient to refer to the encyclopedic book of R. Penrose [1].

1. Projective postulate and null-measurement.
The so-called null-measurement (see paragraph 22.7, [1]) is in fact a non-relevant
ρ > even
construction, since the conclusion that “we know that photon is in state
|
τ >-P.L.)
though it has not interacted with the detector (in the transmission channel
|
at all”, is based on the explicit belief that the photon already has passed splitter.
But photon might be simply absorbed even before this splitter. Therefore, strictly
speaking, we do not have reliable information without a detection in the corresponding
channel. This example shows that if one has left some gap between two successive

quantum states, the application of the projective postulate (if no

In the framework of my model the projection acts continuously and locally along
CP (N
1) trajectory of GCS onto the corresponding tangent spaces, since it is
the covariant diﬀerentiation of vector ﬁelds representing local dynamical variables
(LDV’s) on CP (N

1).

−

2. Deformation of GCS during interaction used for measurement.
Let me discuss dynamics of Schr¨odinger’s lump during measurement (see para-
graph 30.10, [1]). This construction is a humane version of the Schr¨odinger’s cat.
In distinguish with so complicated system as poisoned cat, and indeﬁnite displaced
lump of matter, we would like discuss the deformation of GCS which is theoretically
analyzable.

−

First of all I should note that the assumption that “the energy in each case is
the same” may be correct only approximately, say, in the case of adiabatic “kicking”
of the lump. The ﬁnite time of transition unavoidably leads to the acceleration
of the lump of matter, to the deformation of its quantum state [10, 11], and to
the shift of mass-energy. Hence, the superposition state is not stationary (beating)
and, therefore, this is useless for our decision about real interaction process of the
photon and splitter (as well as in the original “comic example” of Schr¨odinger’s cat
demonstrating incompleteness of the wave function description of an nuclear decay
[12]).

In the framework of my model, the GCS of the lump is “kicked” in the ﬁrst ap-
proximation by the coset transformations of SU(N) group. The coeﬃcient functions
of the SU(N) generators obey some quasi-linear relativistic ﬁeld equations in the
local dynamical space-time [2, 3, 4].

3. The diﬀerence of the masses of the original and the displaced lumps leads to
diﬀerent time-like Killing vectors (if any) in the vicinities of two lumps. This is an
obstacle to write Schr¨odinger equations for superposed wave function. But, who does
need it? This is rather a privilege than a defect, since one has a natural decoherence
mechanism.

In the framework of my model one has state-dependent space-times arising as
speciﬁc cross-section of the tangent ﬁbre bundle over CP (N
1). Linear superposition
has a sense only in dynamical space-time in the quantum system (setup, lump) under
the condition of physical integrity. In general, the formulation of the physical integrity
is a diﬃcult problem; in my model the GCS expresses this property. This leads to
the dynamics in the tangent ﬁbre bundle over CP (N
1). All thought compounds of
free independent systems are trivial since they live in the tensor product of the state
spaces.

−

Below will be introduced some fundamental notions of my construction.

2 Action states with entire number N of ¯h

The masses of known “elementary” particles mJ are in the fundamental de Broglie
relation to corresponding internal frequencies ωJ:

If one treat the U = c2 as the cosmic potential, then arise the natural question
about the micro-selective mechanism capable produce very speciﬁc spectrum of fre-

quencies.
In the ordinary quantization scheme it is assumed that the oscillator is
really some fundamental entity. But the spectrum of oscillator is equidistant and
unbounded whereas the mass-spectrum of “elementary” particles does not. Further-
more, the classical soliton-like solution cannot be decomposed into harmonic waves,
hence quantum solitons are not a compound of quantum oscillators. I try to ﬁnd a
dispersion law Ω(P ) (initially in the form Ω(X)) as a solution of the non-linear ﬁeld
equations.

There are some additional reasons for the modiﬁcation of the “second quantiza-

tion” procedure.

First. In the second quantization method one has formally given particles whose
properties are deﬁned by some commutation relations between creation-annihilation
operators. Note, that the commutation relations are only the simplest consequence
of the curvature of the dynamical group manifold in the vicinity of the group’s unit
(in algebra). Dynamical processes require, however, ﬁnite group transformations and,
hence, the global group structure. The main technical idea is to use vector ﬁelds over
group manifold instead of indeﬁnite Dirac’s q-numbers. This scheme therefore look-
ing for the dynamical nature of the creation and annihilation processes of quantum
particles.

Second. The quantum particles (energy bundles) should gravitate. Hence, strictly
speaking, their behavior cannot be described as a linear superposition. Therefore the
ordinary second quantization method (creation-annihilation of free particles) is merely
a good approximate scheme due to the weakness of gravity. Thereby the creation and
annihilation of particles are time consuming dynamical non-linear processes. So,
linear operators of creation and annihilation (in Dirac sense) do exist as approximate
quantities.

Third. Nobody knows how arise a quant of energy (quantum particle). Deﬁnitely,
there is an energy quantization but the dynamical nature of this process is unknown.
Avoiding the vacuum stability problem, its self-energy, etc., we primary quantize,
however, the action, not energy. The relative (local) vacuum of some problem is not
the state with minimal energy, it is a state with an extremal of some action functional.

but their ﬁeld carriers - “ﬁeld shell” are smeared in dynamical space-time. There-
fore, quantum “particles”, and, hence, their numbers should arise as some countable
solutions of non-linear wave equations. In order to establish acceptable ﬁeld equa-

intensive interaction, we should build some universal ambient Hilbert state space

The CP (N

1) manifold takes the place of “classical phase space” [15], since
its points, corresponding to the GCS, are most close to classical states of motion.
Two interpretations may be given for the points of CP (N
1). One of them is
the “Schr¨odinger’s lump” [1] and the second one is the analog of the Stern-Gerlach
“ﬁlter’s orientations” discussed by Fivel [16]. The root content of their physical
interpretations is that one has a macroscopic (i.e. space-time) discriminator of two
quantum states. As such, they may be used as “yes/no” states of some two-level
detector. We will use the “Schr¨odinger’s lump” interpretation. Let us assume that
GCS described by local coordinates (π1, ..., πN −1) correspond to the original lump,
and the coordinates (π1 + δπ1, ..., πN −1 + δπN −1) correspond to the displaced lump.
Such hidden coordinates of the lump gives a ﬁrm geometric tool for the description
of quantum dynamics during interaction used for the measuring process.

−

Then the question that I now want to rise is as following: what “classical ﬁeld”,
i.e ﬁeld in space-time, correspond to the transition from the original to the displaced
lump? In other words we would like ﬁnd the “ﬁeld shell” of the lump, its space-
time shape and its dynamics. The lump’s perturbations will be represented by the
“geometric bosons” [17] whose frequencies are not a priori given, but which deﬁned
by some ﬁeld equations which should established due to a new variation problem.
Before its formulation, we ought to use in fact a sophisticated diﬀerential geometric
construction in order to avoid the clash between quantum mechanics and general
relativity [1].

−

I will assume that all “vacua” solutions belong to single separable projective Hilbert
space CP (N
1). The vacuum represented by GCS is merely the stationary point of
some action functional, not solution with the minimal energy. Energy will be associ-
ated with tangent vector ﬁeld to CP (N

in respect with the notion of the Newton-Stueckelberg-Horwitz-Piron (NSHP) time

space-time is functionally local (state-dependent) in CP (N
1) and the space-time
motion dictated by the ﬁeld equations connected with two inﬁnitesimally close GCS.
The connection between these local space-times may be physically established by the
measurement given in terms of geometry of the base manifold CP (N
1). It seems to
be like the Everett’s idea about “parallel words”, but has of course diﬀerent physical
I think
sense. Now we are evidences of the Multiverse (omnium) concept [1, 19].
there is only one Universe but there exists continuum of dynamical space-times each
of them related to one point of the quantum phase space CP (N
1). The standard
approach, identifying Universe with space-time, is too strong assumption from this
point of view.

of the ﬁeld conﬁgurations with ﬁnite action quanta is a stationary
construction. We introduce dynamics by the velocities of the GCS variation represent-

by the Hamiltonian, giving time variation velocities of the action quantum numbers
in diﬀerent directions of the tangent Hilbert space T(π1,...,πN−1)CP (N

5 Lorentz transformations and dynamical space-

time

The Einstein’s analysis of the Galileo-Newtonian kinematics in an inertial reference
frame, based on the classical Maxwell’s electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, led us to a new

8

relativistic kinematics [20]. Unfortunately, similar analysis based on the quantum
theory is in a very preliminary state [1, 21]. The continuation of such a work is
necessary.

It is clear that the coincidence of the “arrow” with some number on the “limb”
is in fact the coincidence of the two space-time points. But one has in the quantum
area literally neither “arrow” nor the “limb”; some “clouds” or “ ﬁeld shell” one has
instead. Thereby the uncertainty principe puts the limit for the exact coincidence
of two events. Therefore, in comparison with us, Einstein had two privileges: he
had intuitively clear classical measuring devises (clocks, scales, rods, etc.) and the
intuitively clear spatial coincidence of two “points”, say, the end of a rod and the
end of the scale. Without these ingredients it is diﬃcult to image the measurement
process and even the space-time notion itself. Generally, space-time coordinates lose
direct physical sense even in the framework of general relativity [22]. Quantum theory
poses a new problem concerning operational sense of the microscopic invariance of
the space-time scale. Indeed, all abstract (notional) tools of macroscopic laboratory
(clocks, scales, rods, etc.) one should change for the microscopic ones. Note, Bohr’s
proposal about “classical apparatus” is unacceptable since it is inconsistent. We
should construct now the space-time notion in the internal quantum terms.

The notion of physical space is based on the abstraction of separation between two
material points assuming that they may be as far as we need. This separation may
be measured by some hard scale. The “hard scale” in fact means the “the same” or
identical scale, i.e. the scale with invariant length relative some transformation group.
But in quantum theory it is inconsistent (or it is at least questionable) to use a priori
space-time symmetries. Similar arguments is applicable to time separation because
of the speciﬁc problem of the “time-of-arrival” [23]. Generally speaking, space-time
separation is state-dependent. In such situation, one should decide on what is the
criterion of identity is physically acceptable in our case. If, say, electrons used for the
measurement of separation between a source S1 and a detector D1, than the most
reasonable to use the criterion of the “same electron” (emitted from S1 and detected
in D1). All quantum electrons are of course identical but there are momentum and
spin which distinguish one electron from another. But in general this criterion is not
so good as we need since we cannot be sure that the electron detected in D2 is same
as in D1, or even that this has some causal connection with the previous stage of the
measurement. There is at least one reason for this verdict: the detection of some
accidental electron, e.g. due to a quantum ﬂuctuations, etc. Nevertheless, in the
bubble chamber one may be sure that whole visible trace belongs to “same electron”.
Therefore, if interaction is not so drastic or, if one takes into account all possible decay
channels of an unitary multiplete, we could formulate the criterion of identity. Let

9

me to formulate this criterion previously with promise to decode all components of
the statement: the local Hamiltonian should be parallel transported during a “smooth”
evolution. I introduce the concept of “dynamical space-time” as a new construction
capable to detect the coincidences of the qubit components in the formal two-level
“detector” which is a part of the full quantum conﬁguration (setup modeled by the
GCS). The “extraction” of this “detector” is of course more or less a free choice of an
observer. It is important only that the chosen LDV should be invariantly connected
with the qubit coherent state in respect with a one of the points of the LDV spectrum.
I will assume that the spectrum of the LDV is known even if it is really problematic
like, for example, in the PDE eigen-problem ~H

5.1 Embedding “Hilbert (quantum) dynamics” in space-time

space-time we should to formalize the quantum observation (or measurement of some
internal dynamical variable).

The last ones describing the interaction used for the measurement process. It is im-
portant to understand that the measurement i.e. comparison of the expected qubit
spinor (α0, β0) at and measured qubit spinor (α1, β1) pave the way to embedding
Hilbert space dynamics into the local dynamical space-time. This is the replacement
of the notorious “arrow” of the measuring device, namely: one has two-level system
(logical spin 1/2 [10]) created by the quantum question-unitary projector onto one
T >. Their coherent states are given by the qubit spinors
of the two states
(α, β) being connected with inﬁnitesimal SL(2, C) transformations give rise to the
variation of the space-time coordinates generated by local inﬁnitesimal Lorentz trans-
formations. Why we can do this conclusion?

N >,

|

|

Causal classical events lie (in good approximation) on a light cone which is in-
variant relative the Lorentz group. On the other hand the formal “Lorentz spin
transformations matrix” transform the spinor of the quantum question being applied
to measurement of some LDV helping us to detect some event. The classical detection
of an event is based on the coincidence of the two spinors one of which corresponds
to the expectation value and the second to detecting value of LDV. This is possible

10

only under the tuning of orientation by rotation and the tuning of velocity by accel-
eration. Therefore we should identify “Lorentz spin transformations matrix” of the
qubit spinors with Lorentz transformation of classical inertial frame.

The speciﬁc components of LDV’s (see below) take the place of these entities.
But now LDV is vector ﬁeld deﬁned over CP (N
1) and the comparison of LDV
at diﬀerent setups (initial and perturbed due to interaction used for measurement)
require some procedure of the self-identiﬁcation. It is impossible to compare expected
and measured LDV “directly” (decoherence due to CP (N
1) geometry [5]). The
aﬃne parallel transport is quite acceptable for this aim. The parallel transport forms
the condition for the coeﬃcient functions of the LDV leading to the nonlinear ﬁeld
equations in the local dynamical space-time.

5.2 Diﬀerential geometry of the measuring procedure

The measurement, i.e. attributing a number to some dynamical variable or observable
has in physics subjective as well as objective sense. Namely: the numeric value of some
observable depends as a rule on a setup (the character of motion of laboratory, type of
the measuring device, ﬁeld strength, etc.). However the relationships between numeric
values of dynamical variables and numeric characteristics of laboratory motion, ﬁeld
strength, etc., should be formulated as invariant, since they reﬂect the objective
character of the physical interaction used in the measurement process. The numbers
obtained due to the measurements carry information which does not exist a priori,
i.e. before the measurement process. But the information comprised of subjective as
well as objective invariant part reﬂects the physics of interaction. The last is one of
the main topics of QFT. Since each measurement reducible (even if it is unconscious)
to the answer of the question “yes” or “no”, it is possible to introduce formally a
quantum dynamical variable “logical spin 1/2” [10] whose coherent states represent
the quantum bit of information “qubit”.

POSTULATE 3
We assume that the invariant i.e. physically essential part of information rep-
resented by the coherent states of the “logical spin 1/2” is related to the space-time
structure.

Such assumption is based on the observation that on one side the space-time is the
manifold of points modeling diﬀerent physical systems (stars, atoms, electrons, etc.)
artiﬁcially depleted of all physical characteristics (material points without reference
to masses). In principle arbitrary local coordinates may be attributed to these points.
But as we know from general relativity the metric structure depends on the matter
distribution and the zero approximation of the metric tensor gµν = ηµν + ... gives the

11

Lorentz invariant interval [22]. On the other hand the spinor structure of the Lorentz
transformations represents the transformations of the coherent states of the “logical
spin 1/2” or “qubit”. Thereby we can assume the measurement of the quantum
dynamical variables expressed by the “qubit” spinor “creates” the local space-time
coordinates. We will formulate non-linear ﬁeld equations in this local space-time due
to a variational principle referring to the generator of the quantum state deformation.
The internal hidden dynamics of the quantum conﬁguration given by GCS should
be somehow reﬂected in physical space-time. Therefore we should solve the “inverse
representation problem”: to ﬁnd locally unitary representation of dynamical group
SU(N) in the dynamical space-time where acts the induced realization of the coher-
ence group SU(2) of the qubit spinor [2, 3]. Its components subjected to the “Lorentz
spin matrix transformations” [14]. We should build the local spinor basis invariantly
related to the ground states manifold CP (N
1). First of all we have to have the
local reference frame (LRF) as some analog of the “representation” of SU(N). Each
LRF and, hence, SU(N) “representation” may be marked by the local coordinates
(3.1) of the “vacuum landscape”. Now we should almost literally repeat diﬀerential
= C N . The
geometry of a smooth manifold embedded in ﬂat ambient Hilbert space
geometry of this smooth manifold is the projective Hilbert space equipped with the
Fubini-Study metric (4.1) and with the aﬃne connection (4.2).

Hence the inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformations deﬁne small “space-time” coordi-
nates variations. It is convenient to take Lorentz transformations in the following form
ct′ = ct+(~x~a)dτ,
~ω =
(ω1, ω2, ω3) [14] in order to have for τ the physical dimension of time. The coordi-
nates xµ of points in this space-time serve in fact merely for the parametrization of
deformations of the “ﬁeld shell” arising under its motion according to non-linear ﬁeld
equations [2, 3].

6 Field shell equations (FSE)

In order to ﬁnd the “ﬁeld shell” of the perturbed GCS one should establish some
wave equations in the dynamical space-time. All these notions require more precise
deﬁnitions. Namely, say, in the simplest case of CP (1), the “ﬁeld shells” being
represented in the spherical coordinates are the classical vector ﬁelds Ωα = xα
r (ω +
iγ),

a = 0, 1, ...N, ... now strongly connected with the tensor character of the GCS driving
ﬁeld Ωα. These ﬁelds are “classical” since they are not subjected to quantization
directly, i.e. by the attribution of the fermionic or bosonic commutation relations.
They obey to nonlinear ﬁeld equations. Their internal dynamical variables like spin,
charge, etc., will be a consequence of their dynamical structure.

“Particle” now associated with the “ﬁeld shell” in the dynamical space-time (see

the CP (N
But displaced GCS may by reached along of one of continuum pathes. Therefore the
comparison of two vector ﬁelds and their “expectation values” in neighborhood points
requires some natural rule. The “natural” in our case means that the comparison has
sense only for same “particle” or for its “ﬁeld shell”. For this reason one should
have a “self-identiﬁcation” procedure. The aﬃne parallel transport in CP (N
1) of
vector ﬁelds is a natural and the simplest rule for the comparison of corresponding
“ﬁeld shells”. Physically the self-identiﬁcation of “particle” literally means that its
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld is the Fubini-Study covariant constant.

−

But there are questions: what should coincide, and what is the “expected” and
what is “the detected particles”, because we have not particles at all? Since we have
only the unitary ﬁelds Ωα as parameters of GCS transformations we assume that in
accordance with the super-equivalence principle under the inﬁnitesimal shift of the
unitary ﬁeld δΩα in the dynamical space-time, the shifted Hamiltonian ﬁeld should
coincide with the inﬁnitesimal shift of tangent Hamiltonian ﬁeld generated by the
parallel transport in CP (N

If one wishes to ﬁnd the ﬁeld corresponding to a given trajectory, say, a geodesic
in CP (N

CP (1), one may put π1 = eiφ tan(στ ). Then V 1 = dπ1
dτ = σ sec2(στ )eiφ, and one has
a linear wave equations for the gauge unitary ﬁeld Ωα in the dynamical space-time
with complicated coeﬃcient functions of the local coordinates (π1, ..., πN −1). Under
the assumption τ = wt this equation has following solution

7 Quasi-Hamiltonian equations

The theory of the quasi-liner PDE ﬁeld equations (6.3) is well known [26, 27]. I wish
apply general approach looking on the quasi-linear PDE as a particular case of the

17

nonlinear PDE. Let me write such equation in the form

G(xµ, Pµ, Ω) = vµ ∂Ω

∂xµ + ΩΓm

mnV n = 0,

(7.1)

where I put Pµ = ∂Ω
∂xµ . Such PDE equations demonstrate a natural “wave-corpuscular
duality” in the following sense. Equation (7.1) itself is ﬁeld equation relative Ω. Then
“4-velocity” vµ = dxµ
dτ against the parameter of evolution τ may be treated as velocities
of “corpuscules” moving along trajectories in the dynamical space-time. We can see
it from the following calculations. The equation (7.1) deﬁne the hyper-surface E in
the 9-dimension space of 1-jets [27]. The phase curves lie as whole on E and obey
following quasi-Hamiltonian system.

Here one has generalized Hamiltonian equations describing a “corpuscular” point-wise
motion in the 4D dynamical space-time. The analysis of stability of their solutions and
the physical sense of their Schr¨odinger’s quantization require future investigations.

8 Conclusion

The main new points of my approach are following:

A. I use the notion of “elementary quantum motions” (EQM)

¯ha > with well
|
deﬁned quantized Planck’s action Sa = ¯ha instead of the notion of “elementary
particles”. Their GCS’s serve as an abstract formalization of the “quasi-classical”
description of a quantum setup or “Schr¨odinger’s lump” [1].

18

B. The quantum phase space CP (N

1) serves as the base of the tangent ﬁbre
−
bundle of the local dynamical variables. The special cross-section of this bundle and
aﬃne gauge ﬁeld are geometric tools for the quantum measurement in the state-
dependent dynamical space-time.

C. Integration over all pathes (alternatives) realizes the objective approach in

quantum theory. The dominate contribution will be given by the geodesic of CP (N
1) spanning two GCS’s [5].

−

The technical details are as follows:
1. The projective representation of pure N-dimension quantum states (one could
think of arbitrary large N), provides a natural non-linear realization of the G =
SU(N) group manifold and the coset sub-manifold G/H = SU(N)/S[U(1)
1)] = CP (N

−
1). I consider the generators of this group as LDV’s [5] of the model.
2. These quantum dynamical variables are represented by the tangent vector ﬁelds

H

3. Quantum measurement “creates” local dynamical space-time capable of detect-
ing the coincidence of expectation and measured values of these quantum dynamical
variables.

4. The aﬃne parallel transport, associated with the Fubini-Study metric, accom-
panied with “Lorentz spin transformation matrix” [14], establish this coincidence due
to the identiﬁcation of the parallel transported LDV at diﬀerent GCS’s.

5. The parametrization of the measurement results with the help of attributed local
space-time coordinates is in fact the embedding of quantum dynamics in Hilbert space
into 4D world. This procedure is well deﬁnite due to the existence of the inﬁnitesimal
SL(2, C) transformations of the qubit spinor treated as Lorentz transformations of
local space-time coordinates.

6. The quasi-linear PDE for non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld in dynamical space-time
naturally related to the ODE of their characteristics. The last ones are similar to the
Hamilton canonical equations. Their quantization leads to Schro¨odinger-like equa-
tions whose properties will be discussed elsewhere.

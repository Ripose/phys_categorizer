For a monopole, the analogue of the Lorentz equation in matter is shown to be f = g (H − v × D).
Dual-symmetric Maxwell equations, for matter containing hidden magnetic charges in addition to electric
ones, are given. They apply as well to ordinary matter if the particles possess T-violating electric dipole
moments. Two schemes of experiments for the detection of such moments in macroscopic pieces of matter
are proposed.

1. INTRODUCTION

The question of which classical macroscopic ﬁelds
exert a force on a magnetic monopole of charge g in
matter is still controversial [1]. For the static force,
the formula

f = g H ,

(1)

instead of f = g B, is generally accepted. However,
for the velocity dependent force, there is no consen-
sus between f = −g v × E and f = −g v × D (we
use rationalized equations with c = ε0 = µ0 = 1).
A more general problem is to generalize the macro-
scopic Maxwell equations to the dual-symmetric mat-
ter. The atoms or molecules of such a matter would
be made not only of electrically, but also of magnet-
ically charged particles. Thus they can possess

• electric dipole moments coming from decentered
electric charges as well as spinning magnetic
charges

• magnetic moments comming from spinning elec-
tric charges as well as decentered magnetic
charges.

After a rederivation and a discussion of Eq.(1),
we will present below a consistent solution for the

velocity-dependent force and the dual-symmetric
Maxwell equations in matter, using simple physical
arguments. We will consider only isotropic matter
and assume that its electric and magnetic polariza-
tions P and M are linear in D and B (or E and
H). It will appear that our equations can also take
into account the electric dipole moments (e.d.m.) of
the ordinary fermions generated by T-violating in-
teractions, and we will propose two kinds of possible
measurements of the e.d.m. in macroscopic matter.

2. STATIC FORCE ON A MONOPOLE IN
MATTER.

If the force acting on a monopole in matter were
f = g B, a monopole following a closed magnetic
line of a permanent magnet could gain energy at
each turn, providing a perpetual motion of the ﬁrst
species. This is an argument for chosing f = g H, the
curl of which is zero for a static system.

One might object that the monopole can gain en-
ergy at each turn at the expense of the magnetic
energy stored by the magnet and will eventually
erase the magnetization of the metal. This is in-
deed what happens when a monopole is circulating
through a superconducting loop : the varying ﬂux

Another argument

of the monopole ﬁeld through the loop produces a
counter-electromotive force which damps the super-
current. However, in the case of a ferroelectric annu-
lus, the magnetized state has the lowest energy and
the annulus cannot yield any energy to the monopole.
from the
for
(gedanken) following experiment : Let us measure the
force on a magnetic charge immersed in a ferroﬂuid.
The latter is a practical realization of a liquid magne-
tizable matter. No static frictional force can perturb
the measurement. We protect the monopole from the
ﬂuid by a waterproof box. This should not change the
result ; anyway the physical monopole is probably
dressed by a swarm of ordinary particles. In the ab-
sence of the monopole, we denote by B ≡ µH the ﬁeld
outside the box and by Bbox = Hbox the ﬁeld inside
the box. The ﬁelds coming from the monopole will
be denoted by a prime. Let us consider two shapes
of box (Fig.1) :
a) the box is elongated parallel to B. Then Bbox =
H and the measured force is f = g H.

2

b) the box is ﬂattened perpendicular to B. Then
Bbox = B. The force acting on the pole is f1 = g B,
which is diﬀerent from case a). On the other hand,
in front of the box the total ﬁeld Btot = B + B′
is larger than behind. The magnetic grains of the
ferroﬂuid are therefore attracted toward this region
and build a hydrostatic pressure which pushes the
box backwards. Quantitatively, the force acting on
one grain of magnetic moment ~m in the nonuniform
ﬁeld Btot is

fi = mj ∂jBtot

i = mj ∂iBtot

j

,

(2)

since ∇ × Btot = 0 for a static system. Repeated
indices are summed over. The resulting macroscopic
force by unit volume is

= M tot

j =

∂i (Btot · Btot)

where Mtot = M + M′ = χ(B + B′) is the magneti-
zation density and χ = µ−1
µ . This ﬁeld of force builds
the pressure

p =

Btot · Btot =

(B2 + B′2) + M · B′

The ﬁrst two terms are symmetrical about the box
and exert no net force on it. The last term gives

Here dS is the vector representation of a surface ele-
ment of the box and is directed outward. Permuting
dS and M was allowed because they are parallel in
the region where B′ is important. The last equal-
ity comes from Gauss theorem for magnetic charges.
Adding f1 and f2 one recovers the result (1) :

f = f1 + f2 = g (B − M) = g H .

(3)

Most probably, (1) can be generalized to any shape of
box. Thus, the relevant ﬁeld which drives a monopole
in matter is H.
It is the ﬁeld found in a parallel
elongated cavity, as for the force f = e E driving an
electric charge inside a dielectric. Mnemonic : this
kind of cavity allows the test charge to follow the
force without touching the matter.

b)

Eq.(1) allows trapping a (not too heavy) monopole
in the pole of a permanent magnet, where the lines
of gH converge from all directions. This would not
be true for gB.

Microscopic interpretation

Atomic magnetic dipoles are often pictured as mi-
croscopic loops of electrical current. Then B appears
as the average of the microscopic ﬁeld b over semi-
macroscopic volumes suﬃciently large compared to
the atomic scale. The work of b along a straight line
L is therefore

g

ZL

b · dl = g

B · dl .

ZL

In contrast, the work along a line L′ which avoids
passing through the loops is

Eq.(1) implies that the monopole avoids passing
through the microscopic current loops or more likely
that the loops move to ”dodge” the monopole. This
was of course the case with the ferroﬂuid, but in solid
matter the atoms cannot escape from the monopole
trajectory. Does it means that (1) is false if the
monopole goes through an atom ? Not necessarily.
At the approach of the pole, the electron wave func-
tions are deformed and, if the monopole is suﬃciently
slow, they return adiabatically to the ground states.
Thus no energy is exchanged between the monopole
and the atom, as if the loop ”dodges” the monopole.

3. VELOCITY-DEPENDENT FORCE

In vacuum, the analog of the Lorentz force for a
moving monopole is f = −g v × E. Accordingly,
a piece dl of wire carrying a current I ⋆ of mag-
netic charges is subject to the dual Laplace force
df = −I ⋆ dl × E. Following the ferroﬂuid example,
we consider a wire protected by a waterproof tube in
a liquid dielectric (Fig.2) :
a) the tube is ﬂattened perpendicular to D = εE.
Then Etube = D and the measured force is

df = −I ⋆ dl × D .

(4)

b) the tube is ﬂattened parallel to D = εE. Then
Etube = E. The force acting on the wire is df1 =

−I ⋆ dl × E. On the other hand, on the right of
the tube, the total ﬁeld D + D′ is larger than on
the left. The polar molecules are therefore attracted
toward this region, building an excess of pressure
which pushes the tube toward the left. Calculations
like those between Eqs. (2) and (3) give the thrust
df2 = −I ⋆ dl×P, where P is the macroscopic electric
polarization. In total,

df = df1 + df2 = −I ⋆ dl × (E + P)

is equivalent to (4). Thus the ﬁeld acting on a wire of
magnetic current is D. It is the ﬁeld found in a per-
pendicular ﬂattened cavity, as for the Laplace force
df = I dl × B on an ordinary current in a magnetized
matter. Mnemonic : this cavity allows the wire to
follow the force without touching the matter.

For a moving monopole, (4) becomes

f = −g v × D .

(4′)

Microscopic interpretation

In a dielectric, E is the average of the microscopic
ﬁeld e over volumes suﬃciently large compared to the
molecular scale. The work of e when the wire sweeps
a ﬂat surface S is

I ⋆

e · dS = I ⋆

E · dS .

Z ZS

Z ZS

In contrast, the work of e along a surface S′ which
avoids cutting the dipole molecules is

I ⋆

e · dS = I ⋆

D · dS .

Z ZS′

Z ZS′

Eq.(4) implies that a moving dual wire avoids cutting
the dipole molecules, or that the molecules ”dodge”
the wire. This has a well-deﬁned topological mean-
ing. Let us recall however that this wire was intro-
duced to make the problem time-independent. For a
moving monopole, there is no swept surface and the
topological interpretation is lost.

Gathering (1) and (4’), the total force on a mag-

netic charge is

f = g (H − v × D) .

(5)

This result does not take into account dissipation and
holds only for suﬃciently slow monopoles, such that
atoms and molecules evolve adiabatically under the
inﬂuence of the monopole ﬁeld.

4. MAXWELL EQUATIONS IN DYONIC
MATTER

We consider matter containing magnetic charges
±g bound in magnetically neutral molecules, in ad-
dition to ordinary particles. These molecules posses
magnetic dipoles of the form gr, building a macro-
scopic magnetic polarization p⋆ (r is the north-south
charge separation).
If they have spin, they also
posses electric dipoles of the form γ⋆S building a
macroscopic electric polarization m⋆ (γ⋆ is the ”giro-
electric” ratio). p⋆ and m⋆ are dual respectively to
the polarization p and the magnetization m built by
the ordinary particles. The dual-symmetric Maxwell
equations for the space average of the microscopic
ﬁelds are

∇ × ¯b − ∂t ¯e = j + δj

4

Here (ρ, j) is the external ordinary charge-current
density and (δρ, δj) the induced one, given by

∇·¯e = ρ + δρ
−∇ × ¯e − ∂t ¯b = j⋆ + δj⋆
∇·¯e = ρ⋆ + δρ⋆ .

δρ = −∇·p

δj = ∇ × m + ∂t p

δρ⋆ = −∇·p⋆

δj⋆ = −∇ × m⋆ + ∂t p⋆

Similarly, for the magnetic charge analogues,

From these equations, we can write the dual-
symmetric Maxwell equations in matter :

∇ × H − ∂t D = j

∇·D = ρ
−∇ × E − ∂t B = j⋆
∇·B = ρ⋆
(6)
where H = ¯b−m, D = ¯e+p as usual, but E = ¯e−m⋆
and B = b+p⋆. We see that E and B can no more be
interpreted as the spatial averages of the microscopic
ﬁelds. In that sense they are no more ”fundamental”
than D and H. In fact the dual of E is not B but H,
whereas the dual of B is −D. The usual relations

D = E + P , B = H + M

are recovered, deﬁning

P ≡ p + m⋆ , M ≡ m + p⋆ .

(7)

(8)

It means that the microscopic nature of the dipole
is forgotten at the level of the macroscopic Maxwell
equations. Only their long range ﬁelds in 1/r3 are rel-
evant. As in ordinary matter, E and H are the ﬁelds
found in elongated cavities parallel to the respective
ﬁelds, whereas D and B are found in perpendicular
ﬂat cavities.

(momentum ﬂow) one considers a sandwich made
of three slab-like regions of the z coordinate, R1 =
[−a, 0], R2 = [0, b] and R3 = [b, b + a]. R1 carries
uniform electric and magnetic charge-current densi-
ties, {ρ, j ; ρ⋆, j⋆} and R3 carries the opposite densi-
ties, such that the ﬁelds vanish outside the sandwich.
Solving (6) and (12) with appropriate ρ, j, ρ⋆, j⋆, any
kind of uniform ﬁeld conﬁguration {E, D ; H, B} can
be obtained in R2. These ﬁelds are linearly attenu-
ated in R1 and R3. In R3 a power

is exerted per unit of volume. The same quantities
per unit of area (integrated over z in R3) give Θz0
and Θzi in R2.

To get Θ00 (energy density) and Θ0i (momentum
density) one has to ”rotate” the sandwich in the 4-
dimensional space-time, replacing z by t and slabs
by time-slices or ”epoch” T1, T2, T3. During T1 the
(3-dimensional) space is ﬁlled with uniform current
densities j and j⋆, which progressively build uniform
ﬁelds according (6) and (12). The second epoch is
current-free and the uniform ﬁelds remain constant.
The last epoch destroys the ﬁelds with opposite cur-
rents. Integrating (14) and (15) over t in T3 give Θ00
and Θ0i in T2. This method is detailled in [2]. One
obtains

of [χ] violate P- and T- symmetries, since they con-
nect vector to pseudovectors. However PT is con-
served.

tum conservation in simple physical systems. Let
us suppose that the whole space is ﬁlled with dual-

where ˆn is the unit vector from the charge toward

obtained from the quantization rule J · ˆn = n¯h/2.
Note that if the momentum density were E × H, as
sometimes advocated (see the discussion in [3]), the
Dirac condition in medium would not be consistent
with that in vacuum.

7. APPLICATION TO THE SEARCH FOR
AN ELECTRIC DIPOLE MOMENT

The dual-symmetric formalism applies as well to
the case were the electron (or the nucleus) possesses
an electric dipole moment (e.d.m.) ~d = γ⋆S in addi-
tion to the usual magnetic moment ~m = γS. Then
we have m/γ = m⋆/γ⋆ and a nondiagonal [χ] ma-
trix element is generated, like with dyonic molecules
(Eqs.10-11) :

A nonzero χ12 may be generated in another way :
the e.d.m. tends to align the spin of an electron along

ples m to p. Here we consider only the ﬁrst mecha-
nism.

Eq.(18) suggests two possible measurements of r :
a) In Fig.3a, a cylinder of magnetizable, but insu-
lating material is immersed in a large magnetic ﬁeld
B0. The inside ﬁeld B induces a small electric po-
larization P = χmrB and an electric ﬁeld E. If the
cylinder is much broader than high, we have B = B0,
D ≃ 0 and E ≃ −P. More generally one has

hEi = −x χmrB0

(19)

where the coeﬃcient x < 1 depends on the container
geometry. Let us take a cubic container of size L.
Between the top and the bottom, we can measure

1 eV = 1.6 10−19 joule ≃ 104 kelvin = 5 106¯h/metre
and γe = e¯h/me = 4 10−11 e×cm].

Let us assume r = 10−16, which corresponds to an
electron e.d.m. of 2 10−27 e×cm, ε ∼ 1, χm ∼ 0.5 and
x ∼ 0.5. For a ﬁeld of 1 tesla, and a cube of 1 meter, a
potential diﬀerence of about 0.5 10−8 volt is obtained.
W ∼ 10−9 eV ∼ 10−5 kelvin. The voltmetre has to be
cooled at least to this temperature to prevent thermal
noise.

The dual-symmetric Maxwell equations in matter
are formally unchanged, but E and B can no more
be interpreted as the spatial averages of the micro-
scopic ﬁelds. The duality correspondance is E → H
and D → B. When dyons are present, or when ordi-
nary particles possess electric dipole moments, ε and
µ are replaced by a permittivity-permeability matrix
[1−χ] whose nondiagonal elements violate the P- and
T- symmetries (but not PT). The energy momentum
tensor is also unchanged. The usual Dirac condition
eg = 2nπ ¯h is obtained provided the momentum den-
sity is D×B. These results have been obtained under
the hypothesis that P and M are linear in the ﬁelds.
As an application of the dual-symmetric formal-
ism, two possible measurements of the electron e.d.m.
have been suggested. They are at the limit of the
present technological possibilities. However, mecha-
nisms like the m − p coupling in a polar molecule
mentioned in Sect.7 might enhance the signal.

must be much lower than in case a).

8. CONCLUSION

We have given arguments that the macroscopic
ﬁelds acting on magnetic charges and currents are
H and D. Comparing with electric charges and cur-
rents, one has a uniﬁed mnemonic principle : in each
case, the acting ﬁeld is the one found in a parallel-
elongated (resp. ﬂat-perpendicular) cavity in which a
charge (resp. current wire) can follow the force with-
out touching the medium. In a classical microscopic
picture, a monopole avoids passing through the mi-
croscopic current loops and a dual current wire avoids
cutting the dipole molecules. Quantum mechanically,
it means that the perturbation of the atoms and
molecules lying on the trajectory of the monopole is
adiabatic. This should be the case at low enough ve-
locity in a liquid. The monopole will be presumably
accompanied by a swarm of atoms magnetically (or
electrically, for a dyon) bound to it. In a solid, such
a swarm could forbid the monopole to move without
producing cracks.

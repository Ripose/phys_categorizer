Supermassive black holes have been discovered at the centers of galaxies,
and also in globular clusters. The data shows correlations between the
black hole mass and the elliptical galaxy mass or globular cluster mass.
It is shown that this correlation is accurately predicted by a theory of
gravity which includes the new dynamics of self-interacting space. In spi-
ral galaxies this dynamics is shown to explain the so-called ‘dark matter’
rotation-curve anomaly, and also explains the earth based bore-hole g
anomaly data. Together these eﬀects imply that the strength of the self-
interaction dynamics is determined by the ﬁne structure constant. This
has major implications for fundamental physics and cosmology.

Introduction

Our understanding of gravity is based on Newton’s modelling of Kepler’s phenomenological
laws for the motion of the planets within the solar system. In this model Newton took
the gravitational acceleration ﬁeld to be the fundamental dynamical degree of freedom,
and which is determined by the matter distribution; essentially via the ‘universal inverse
square law’. However the observed linear correlation between masses of black holes with
the masses of the ‘host’ elliptical galaxies or globular clusters suggests that either the
formation of these systems involves common evolutionary dynamical processes or that
perhaps some new aspect to gravity is being revealed. Here it is shown that if rather
than an acceleration ﬁeld a velocity ﬁeld is assumed to be fundamental to gravity, then we
immediately ﬁnd that these black hole eﬀects arise as a space self-interaction dynamical
eﬀect, and that the observed correlation is simply that MBH /M = α/2 for spherical
systems, where α is the ﬁne structure constant (α = e2/¯hc = 1/137.036), as shown in
Fig.1. This dynamics also manifests within the earth, as revealed by the bore hole g
anomaly data, as in Fig.2.
It also oﬀers an explanation of the ‘dark matter’ rotation-
velocity eﬀect, as illustrated in Fig.3. This common explanation for a range of seemingly
unrelated eﬀects has deep implications for fundamental physics and cosmology.

2 Modelling Gravity

Let us phenomenologically investigate the consequences of using a velocity ﬁeld v(r, t)
to be the fundamental dynamical degree of freedom to model gravity. The gravitational
acceleration ﬁeld is then deﬁned by the Euler form

v(r + v(r, t)∆t, t + ∆t)

This form is mandated by Galilean covariance under change of observer. A minimalist
non-relativistic modelling of the dynamics for this velocity ﬁeld gives a direct account
of the various phenomena noted above; basically the Newtonian formulation of gravity
missed a key dynamical eﬀect that did not manifest within the solar system.
In terms of the velocity ﬁeld Newtonian gravity dynamics involves using

. to construct
a rank-0 tensor that can be related to the matter density ρ. The coeﬃcient turns out to
be the Newtonian gravitational constant G.

Hence the modelling of gravity by (5) and (1) now involves two gravitational constants
G and α, with α being the strength of the self-interaction dynamics, but which was not
apparent in the solar system dynamics. We now show that all the various phenomena
1/137 up to experimental
discussed herein imply that α is the ﬁne structure constant
errors [1]. Hence non-relativistic gravity is a more complex phenomenon than currently
understood. The new key feature is that (5) has a one-parameter µ class of vacuum
(ρ = 0) ‘black hole’ solutions in which the velocity ﬁeld self-consistently maintains the
singular form

≈

−
This class of solutions will be seen to account for the ‘black holes’ observed in galaxies and
globular cluster. As well this velocity ﬁeld, from (1), gives rise to a non- ‘inverse square
law’ acceleration

Figure 1: The data shows Log10[MBH /M ] for the ‘black hole’ or ‘dark matter’ masses MBH
for a variety of spherical matter systems with masses M , shown by solid circles, plotted against
Log10[M/M0], where M0 is the solar mass, showing agreement with the ‘α/2-line’ (Log10[α/2] =
2.44) predicted by (17), and ranging over 15 orders of magnitude. The ‘black hole’ eﬀect is the
−
same phenomenon as the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect. The data ranges from the earth, as observed by the
bore hole g anomaly, to globular cluster M15 [5, 6] and G1 [7], and then to spherical ‘elliptical’
galaxies M32 (E2), NGC 4374 (E1) and M87 (E0). Best ﬁt to the data from these star systems
gives α = 1/134, while for the earth data in Fig.2 α = 1/139. A best ﬁt to all the spherical
systems in the plot gives α = 1/136. In these systems the ‘dark matter’ or ‘black hole’ spatial
self-interaction eﬀect is induced by the matter. For the spiral galaxies, shown by the ﬁlled boxes,
where here M is the bulge mass, the black hole masses do not correlate with the ‘α/2-line’. This
is because these systems form by matter in-falling to a primordial black hole, and so these systems
are more contingent. For spiral galaxies this dynamical eﬀect manifests most clearly via the non-
Keplerian rotation-velocity curve, which decrease asymptotically very slowly, as shown in Fig.3, as
determined by the small value of α

1/137. The galaxy data is from Table 1 of [8, updated].

≈

This turns out to be the cause of the so-called ‘dark-matter’ eﬀect observed in spiral
galaxies. For this reason we deﬁne

so that (5) and (1) can be written as

4 Minimal Black Hole Systems

There are two classes of solutions when matter is present. The simplest is when the black
hole forms as a consequence of the velocity ﬁeld generated by the matter, this generates
what can be termed an induced minimal black hole. This is in the main applicable to
systems such as planets, stars, globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. The second class
of solutions correspond to non-minimal black hole systems; these arise when the matter
congregates around a pre-existing ‘vacuum’ black hole. The minimal black holes are
simpler to deal with, particularly when the matter system is spherically symmetric. In
this case the non-Newtonian gravitational eﬀects are conﬁned to within the system. A
simple way to arrive at this property is to solve (14) perturbatively. When the matter
density is conﬁned to a sphere of radius R we ﬁnd on iterating (14) that the ‘dark matter’
density is conﬁned to that sphere, and that consequently g(r) has an inverse square law
behaviour outside of the sphere. Iterating (14) once we ﬁnd inside radius R that

ρDM (r) =

sρ(s)ds + O(α2).

(16)

and that the total ‘dark matter’

where M is the total amount of (actual) matter. Hence to O(α) MDM /M = α/2 inde-
pendently of the matter density proﬁle. This turns out to be a very useful property as

knowledge of the density proﬁle is then not required in order to analyse observational
data. Fig.1 shows the value of MBH /M for, in particular, globular clusters M 15 and G1
and highly spherical ‘elliptical’ galaxies M32, M87 and NGC 4374, showing that this ratio
1/137. However for
lies close to the ‘α/2-line’, where α is the ﬁne structure constant
the spiral galaxies their MDM /M values do not cluster close to the α/2-line. Hence it is
suggested that these spherical systems manifest the minimal black hole dynamics outlined
above. However this dynamics is universal, so that any spherical system must induce such
a minimal black hole mode, but for which outside of such a system only the Newtonian
inverse square law would be apparent. So this mode must also apply to the earth, which
is certainly a surprising prediction. However just such an eﬀect has manifested in mea-
surements of g in mine shafts and bore holes since the 1980’s. It will now be shown that
data from these geophysical measurements give us a very accurate determination of the
value of α in (5).

5 Bore Hole g Anomaly

To understand this bore hole anomaly we need to compute the expression for g(r) just
beneath and just above the surface of the earth. To lowest order in α the ‘dark-matter’
density in (16) is substituted into (14) ﬁnally gives via (1) the acceleration

This gives Newton’s ‘inverse square law’ for r > R, but in which we see that the eﬀective
Newtonian gravitational constant is GN = (1 + α
2 )G, which is diﬀerent to the fundamental
gravitational constant G in (2). This caused by the additional ‘dark matter mass’ in (17).
Inside the earth we see that (18) gives a g(r) diﬀerent from Newtonian gravity. This has
actually been observed in mine/borehole measurements of g(r) [2, 3, 4], though of course
there had been no explanation for the eﬀect, and indeed the reality of the eﬀect was
eventually doubted. The eﬀect is that g decreases more slowly with depth than predicted
by Newtonian gravity. Here the corresponding Newtonian form for g(r) is

which is the form actually observed [4], as shown in Fig.2.

Gravity residuals from a bore hole into the Greenland Ice Cap were determined down
to a depth of 1.5km. The ice had a measured density of ρ = 930 kg/m3, and from (21),
10−11 m3s−2kg−1, we obtain from a linear ﬁt to the slope of the data
using GN = 6.6742
points in Fig.2 that α−1 = 139
5, which equals the value of the ﬁne structure constant
α−1 = 137.036 to within the errors, and for this reason we identify the constant α in (5)
as being the ﬁne structure constant. Then we arrive at the conclusion that there is indeed
‘black hole’ or ‘dark matter’ dynamics within the earth, and that from (17) we have again
for the earth that MBH /M = α/2, as is also shown in Fig.1.

This ‘minimal black hole’ eﬀect must also occur within stars, although that could only
be conﬁrmed by indirect observations. This eﬀect results in g(r) becoming large at the
center, unlike Newtonian gravity, which would aﬀect nuclear reaction rates. This eﬀect
may already have manifested in the solar neutrino count problem [9, 10]. To study this
will require including the new gravity dynamics into solar models.

6 Spiral Galaxies

We now consider the situation in which matter in-falls around an existing primordial black
hole. Immediately we see some of the consequences of this time evolution: (i) because the
acceleration ﬁeld falls oﬀ much slower than the Newtonian inverse square law, as in (9),
this in-fall would happen very rapidly, and (ii) the resultant in-ﬂow would result in the
matter rotating much more rapidly than would be predicted by Newtonian gravity, (iii)
so forming a quasar which, after the in-fall of some of the matter into the black hole has
ceased, would (iv) result in a spiral galaxy exhibiting non-Keplerian rotation of stars and
gas clouds, viz the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect. The study of this time evolution will be
far from simple. Here we simply illustrate the eﬀectiveness of the new theory of gravity
in explaining this ‘dark matter’ or non-Keplerian rotation-velocity eﬀect.

Figure 3: Data shows the non-Keplerian rotation-speed curve vO for the spiral galaxy NGC 3198
in km/s plotted against radius in kpc/h. Lower curve is the rotation curve from the Newtonian
theory for an exponential disk, which decreases asymptotically like 1/√r. The upper curve shows
the asymptotic form from (24), with the decrease determined by the small value of α. This
asymptotic form is caused by the primordial black holes at the centres of spiral galaxies, and which
play a critical role in their formation. The spiral structure is caused by the rapid in-fall towards
these primordial black holes.

We can determine the star orbital speeds for highly non-spherical galaxies in the asymp-
totic region by solving (15), for asymptotically where ρ
0 the velocity ﬁeld will be
approximately spherically symmetric and radial; nearer in we would match such a solu-
tion to numerically determined solutions of (5). Then (15) has an exact non-perturbative
two-parameter (K and RS) analytic solution,

≈

This velocity ﬁeld then gives using (1) the non-Newtonian asymptotic acceleration

applicable to the outer regions of spiral galaxies. We then compute circular orbital speeds
using vO(r) =
rg(r) giving the predicted ‘universal rotation-speed curve’

Because of the α dependent part this rotation-speed curve falls oﬀ extremely slowly with
r, as is indeed observed for spiral galaxies. This is illustrated in Fig.3 for the spiral galaxy
NGC 3198.

7 Conclusion

The observational and experimental data conﬁrm that the massive black holes in globular
clusters and galaxies are necessary phenomena within a theory for gravity which uses a
velocity ﬁeld as the fundamental degree of freedom. This involves two constants G and α
and the data reveals that α is the ﬁne structure constant. This suggests that the spatial
self-interaction dynamics, which is missing in the Newtonian theory of gravity, may be a
manifestation at the classical level of the quantum behaviour of space. It also emerges that
the ‘black hole’ eﬀect and the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect are one phenomenon, namely the non-
Newtonian acceleration caused by singular solutions. This eﬀect must manifest in planets
and stars, and the bore hole g anomaly conﬁrms that for planets. For stars it follows that
the structure codes should be modiﬁed to include the new spatial self-interaction dynamics,
and to determine the eﬀect upon neutrino count rates. The data shows that spherical sys-
tems with masses varying over 15 orders of magnitude exhibit the α-dependent dynamical
eﬀect. The non-Newtonian gravitational acceleration of primordial black holes will cause
rapid formation of quasars and stars, explaining why recent observations have revealed
that these formed very early in the history of the universe. In this way the new theory
of gravity makes the big bang theory compatible with these recent observations. These
developments clearly have major implications for cosmology and fundamental physics.

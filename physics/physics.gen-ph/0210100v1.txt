Retarded Electromagnetic Interaction and Dynamic
Foundation of Classical Statistical Mechanics

Abstract

It is provided in the paper that the non-conservative dissipative force and asymmetry of time reversal
can be naturally introduced into classical statistical mechanics after retarded electromagnetic interaction
between charged micro-particles is considered. In this way, the rational dynamic foundation for classical
statistical physics can established and the revised Liouville’s equation is obtained. The micro-canonical
ensemble, the canonical ensemble, the distribution of near-independent subsystem, the distribution law of
the Maxwell-Boltzmann and the Maxwell distribution of velocities are achieved directly from the Liouville’s
equation without using the hypothesis of equal probability. The micro-canonical ensemble is considered
unsuitable as the foundation of equivalent state theory again, for most of equivalent states of isolated sys-
tems are not the states with equal probabilities actually. The reversibility paradoxes in the processes of
non-equivalent evolutions of macro-systems can be eliminated completely, and the united description of sta-
tistical mechanics of equivalent and non-equivalent states is reached. The revised BBKGY series equations
and hydromechanics equations are reduced, the non-equivalent entropy of general systems is deﬁned and the
principle of entropy increment of the non-equivalent entropy is proved at last.

1. The fundamental problems existing in classical statistical physics

Though classical statistical mechanics has been highly developed, its foundation has not yet been built
up well up to now (1). The ﬁrst problem is about the rationality of the equal probability hypothesis or
the micro-canonical ensemble hypothesiswhich is used as the foundation of equilibrium theory now. The
hypothesis had got much criticism since it was put forward. In order to provide the hypothesis a rational
base, Boltzmann raised the ergodic theory, proving that as long as a system was ergodic, the hypothesis
of equal probability would be tenable. However, the study shows that the evolutions of systems can’t be
ergodic generally (2). So the hypothesis of equal probability can only be regarded as a useful work principle
without strict proof. As for the non-equilibrium statistical systems, we have no united and perfect theory
at present. We do not know how a system to transform from a non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium
one at present and how to deﬁne the non-equivalent entropy of general systems. Besides, there still exists a
so-called reversibility paradox in the theory. Though lots of researches have been done, the really rational
solution still remains to be explored.

The reversibility paradox has been a long-standing problem. There exist two forms of the reversibility
paradox at present. The ﬁrst is the so-called Poincanre’s recurrence. It was put forward by Zermelo in 1896
based on a theorem provided by Poincanre in 1890 (3). According to this form, a conservative system in a
limited space would return to the inﬁnitely nearing neighbor reign of its initial state. The basic ideal of the
proof is described as follows. For a conservative system, the Liouville’s theorem is tenable, so the volume
of phase space is unchanged in the evolution process. Because the volume of phase space is limited, the
system should be recurrent after a long enough time’s evolution. That is to say, the process is reversible.
The second form was put forward by Loschmidt in 1876. Loschmidt thought that any micro-dynamic motion
equation did not change under time reversal, or the motion of any single micro-particle was reversible, so
after the velocities of all particles in a macro-system are reversed at the same time, the system would evolve
along the completely opposite direction. Therefore, the process would be reversible. However, in the evolu-
tion processes of isolated macro-systems, what can be observed is that the processes are always irreversible.
Therefore, there exists the so-called reversibility paradox. Though a large numbers of explanations have
been given up to now, none of them are satisfying.

2. The Lorents retarded force and the basic hypothesis of classical statistical physics

It is well-known that there exist two kinds of motion equations, one is for single particles, the other is
for a statistical systems composed of a larger numbers of particles. The so-called micro-equation of motion

that Loschmidt mentioned about in his time was actually the Newtonian equation md2~r/dt2 = ~F . In that
time quantum mechanics has not been found. Whether the Newtonian equation can keep unchanged under
time reversal depends on the form of force ~F . Only when ~F is conservative, it dose. In general situations
when ~F is relative to time t and momentum ~p, the Newtonian equation can’t keep unchanged under time
reversal in general. In the common statistical systems composed of charged micro-particles, the interaction
forces between micro-particles are electromagnetic forces. In the systems composed of neutral atoms and
molecules, atoms and molecules can be regarded as electromagnetic dipole moments and quadrupole moments
for their deformations caused by interactions and interaction between them can considered as one between
electromagnetic dipole moments and quadrupole moments. In the paper, we only discuss interaction between
charged particles, but the principle is the same for neutral atoms and molecules.

If the retarded interaction is not considered, the Lorentz force between two particles with charges q and

q′ as well as velocities ~v and ~v′ is

~F =

qq′~r
r3 +

qq′~v′ × (~v × ~r)
c2r2

In the current statistical physics, we use the formula to describe interactions between micro-particles. Because
the force is unchanged when ~v → −~v and ~v′ → −~v′ under time reversal, it is impossible for us to introduce the
irreversibility of time reversal into the theory to solve the problems in non-equivalent statistical mechanics.
However, it should be noted that according to special relativity, instantaneous interaction does not exist.
Electromagnetic interaction propagates in the speed of light. So retarded interaction should be considered
between micro-particles in statistical systems. It is proved below that after retarded interaction is considered,
the Lorentz forces can not keep unchanged under time reversal again and a rational dynamic foundation can
be established for classical statistical mechanics and the reversibility paradox can resolved well.

Let t′, ~r′, ~v′ and ~a′ represent retarded time, coordinate, velocity and acceleration, t, ~r, ~v and represent non-

We call the forces as the retarded Lorentz forces in which retarded interaction has been considered. Suppose
there are N particles in the system. Suppose the i particle with charge qi at space point ~ri(t) at time t

In the formula, vin = ~nij ·~vi, v′
j. In order to do rational approximate calculation, let’s
accumulate the magnitude order of acceleration. According to formula a = v2/r′, a/c2 has the magnitude
order of 1/r′. Suppose hydrogen atom can be regarded as a harmonic oscillator with amplitude b and
angle frequency ω, so the acceleration of oscillator is bω2. The magnitude order of energy of hydrogen
atom is E = hc/λ = mv2 = mb2ω2. Suppose the wavelength of photons emitted by hydrogen atom is
λ = 4 × 10−7M , it can be calculated that a/c2 = 1/r′ ≃ 60. But the magnitude order of distance between
atoms is r ≃ 10−8M , 1/r ≃ 108. According to Eq.(4), the ﬁrst item of the retarded Lorentz force directs ratio
to 1/r2. So for the neighbor interaction, we have a/c2r = 1/rr′ = 6 × 10−7/r2 << 1/r2, the item containing

acceleration can be omitted. For the distance interaction, a/c2 ≥ 1/r2, the items containing acceleration
can not be omitted On the other hand, according to the Maxwell distribution of velocity, the average speed
8kT /πm. Under common temperature T = 300K, we have ¯v = 6.3 × 106M ,
of hydrogen atoms is ¯v =
¯v/c = 2.1 × 10−2. So the item containing v/c is much bigger than the item containing acceleration, even
the items containing v2/c2 are bigger than that containing acceleration in near neighbor interaction. So we
should retain the items containing v/c, v2/c2 and va/c3, but omitted high order items, then write Eq.(4) as

On the other hand, according to classical electromagnetic theory, there exists the radiation damping
forces ~G acted on the accelerated particles. The radiation damping forces are relative to the acceleration of
acceleration. Suppose l is the dimension of the particles, particle’s speed v << c, acceleration a << c2/l, the
acceleration of acceleration ˙a << c3/l2, when the distribution of particle’s charge is with spherical symmetry,
we have ~G = κ ˙~a, κ = 2q2/3c3.

In classical electromagnetic theory, the Hamiltonian equations of motions can be described by using the
space coordinates and common momentums ~pi, or by using the spaces coordinates and canonical momentums
~pzi with relation ~pzi = ~pi + qi ~Ai/c. Both are equivalent. In statistical mechanics, it is more convenient to
use common momentums. The accelerations and the accelerations of accelerations of particles should be
regarded as the function of coordinate, momentum and time. On the other hand, the acceleration of the
-particle is caused by other particle’s interactions, and it is relative to the retarded speeds and distances, i,e.,
i = ~a′
~a′
j). So the total Hamiltonian of the non-conservative system composed
of N charged particles can be written as H = H0 + H ′, in which H0 is the conservative Hamiltonian

Because ~v → −~v, ~a → ~a,

˙~a → − ˙~a when t → −t, so the retarded Lorentz forces and the radiation
damping forces can not keep unchanged under time reversal, and irreversibility would be introduced into
theory. In this way we can provide a rational dynamic foundation for statistical physics and solve a series of
fundamental problems existing in the current theory.

The following two basic hypotheses can be regarded as the foundation of classical statistical physics.

(8)

1The interaction forces between charged micro-particles in the macro-systems are the retarded Lorentz
forces and the radiation damping forces showing in Eq.(9). For neutral atoms and molecular, the interac-
tions forces can be considered as the retarded Lorentz forces between electromagnetic dipole moments and
quadrupoles.

2A classical statistical system can be described by the normalized distribution function of ensemble

probability density ρ = ρ(xiσ, piσ, t). The average value of the physical quantity u in the ensemble is

Let’s establish the dynamic equations of classical statistical physics based on these two hypotheses, then

discuss the problems of equivalent and non-equivalent states below.

The Eq.(15) or (16) are just the motion equations the distribution function of ensemble probability

regarded as the basic equation of the classical statistical mechanics. When F ′
iσ = G′
iσ = 0, the equation
becomes the current Liuve equation. Because F ′

Eq.(15) and (16) also can’t be unchanged under time reversal.

4. The statistical distribution of equivalent states

Let’s ﬁrst discuss the deﬁnition of equilibrium states and the hypothesis of equal probability in statistical
physics. The equilibrium states in thermodynamics have strict deﬁnition. The equilibrium states are the
states that the system’s macro-natures do not change with time without external inﬂuence. But in classical

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

statistical theory, the equilibrium states have no independent and strict deﬁnition. For the equilibrium states
of isolated systems, the deﬁnition depends on the equal probability hypothesis. The hypothesis is that for
the equilibrium states of isolated systems, the ensemble probability density is a constant between the curved
surfaces of energies E and E + ∆E in phase space. So in current theory, the equilibrium states of isolated
systems are equivalent to the states of equal probability. For the equilibrium states of non-isolated systems,
there is no strict deﬁnition now. Some documents consider them as the states that the average values of
physical quantities do not change with time. But this kind of deﬁnition depends on what kinds of physical
quantities are used. So it is improper, for the equilibrium is only the nature of system itself, it has nothing
to do with other physical quantities. As for the hypothesis of equal probability, it is a priori hypothesis
and can’t be proved in theory. The reason for the hypothesis to exist may be based on so-called ” the law
of non-diﬀerence”. The hypothesis had got much criticism since it was put forward. In order to provide
the hypothesis a rational base, Boltzmann raised the ergodic theory, proving that as long as a system was
ergodic, the hypothesis of equal probability would be tenable. However, the study shows that the evolutions
of systems can’t be ergodic generally (2). So the ergodic hypothesis can’t be used as the foundation of
classical statistical physics and we have to look for other way out.

For this purpose, let’s discuss the deﬁnition of equilibrium states in statistical physics at ﬁrst. We
deﬁne the equilibrium states of isolated systems as the states that there are no external forces acting on
the systems and the ensemble probabilities do not change with time. This deﬁnition coincides with the
deﬁnition of thermodynamics of equilibrium states. According to the deﬁnition, for isolated systems we have
~Fei(~r, t) = 0. When the equilibrium states are reached, we have dρ/dt = 0 and ∂ρ/∂t = 0. So in the light of
Eq.(15) in equilibrium states, we have

(17)

They are just the equations that the ensemble probability density functions satisfy in the equilibrium states.
There are many kinds of equilibrium states of isolated systems as shown below.

1. The particles are free in the systems with ~F ′

0i = ~F ′
i = 0 and the ensemble probability density
satisﬁes ∂ρ/∂xiσ = 0 and ∂ρ/∂piσ = 0. In this case, the ensemble probability density function ρ = constant,
i.e., ρ has nothing to do with xiσ, piσ and t. This is just the state of equal probability or the so-called
micro-canonical ensemble in the current theory.

i = ~G′

2. Particles in systems are only acted by conservative forces, ~F ′
∂ρ/∂piσ 6= 0. The retarded eﬀect is not considered. In this case, we have

0i 6= 0, ~F ′

i = ~G′

i = 0, and ∂ρ/∂xiσ 6= 0

(20)

In this kinds of equilibrium states, the ensemble probability density functions do not change with time, but
the probabilities are diﬀerent in the diﬀerent points of phase space, or the equivalent states are with unequal
probabilities. It is easy to be veriﬁed that the solution of Eq.(18) is

ρ = Ae−βE = e−ψ−βE

Here A, β and ψ are constants. E = H0 is the total energy of the system. In fact, according to Eq.(19), we
have

∂ρ
∂xiσ

= −βρ

∂H0
∂xiσ

∂ρ
∂piσ

= −βρ

∂H0
∂piσ

Put it into Eq.(18), we can prove that it is the solution of Eq.(18). Eq.(19) is just the canonical ensemble in
the current statistical theory. It is known that this result has nothing to do with whether or not the retarded
Lorentz forces and the damping radiation forces are introduced. Based on the current Liouville’s equation
and the deﬁnition of equilibrium states of isolated systems, we can get it directly. But unfortunately, this
simple method is neglected by the current theory. Perhaps it is just this neglect, the hypothesis of equal
probability became necessary and possible to exist.

If the particles in the system are identical, and the force acted on each particle only relative to its
coordinate, or the particles are independent each other without interactions between them, we have E =

Ei, Ei = Ti + Ui. Here Ti is particle’s kinetic energy, Ui is potential energy, Eq.(19) becomes

P

ρ = Ae−β(E1+···Ei+···+EN ) = Ae−βE1 · · · e−βEi · · · e−βEN

(21)

The formula is just the distribution of near-independent subsystem. By the integral over while space and

This is just the distribution law of the Maxwell-Boltzmann. or the distribution law of most probable value.
If the particles are free without potential forces, we have Ui = 0 and Ei → mv2/2. So the formula above

becomes the Maxwell distribution law of velocities.

f dΩ = Be− mv

2KT dxdydzdvxdvydvz

(25)

Here KT = 1/β, B = e−α. In this case, the distribution function has nothing to do with space coordinates,
showing that the distribution of particles in space is uniform.

When all particles have the same speed in system, according to Eq.(25), we have f = constant and the
system becomes micro-canonical ensemble. So micro-canonical ensemble represents the systems composed
of free particles, in which particle’s speeds are the same and the space distribution is even. This kind of
systems, of course, has no signiﬁcance in practice.

On other hand, if there are two systems with the numbers of particles N1 and N2, energies E1 and E2

individually, we can also get the grand canonical ensemble as done in the current theory.

So it is obvious that we can get all kinds of equivalent distributions from canonical ensemble, including
micro-canonical ensemble. But we can’t obtain canonical ensemble from micro-canonical ensemble. The
situation is just opposite comparing with traditional theory. According to the current theory, canonical
ensemble is deduced from micro-canonical ensemble, representing the equilibrium states of small systems
to contact with big heat sources. So canonical ensemble describes the equilibrium states of non-isolated
systems according to traditional statistical theory. But according to the Liouville’s equation, canonical
ensemble describes the equilibrium states of isolated systems. So micro-canonical ensemble contradicts the
result of the Liouville’s equation. On the other hand, micro-canonical ensemble is only one of equilibrium
states. The other equilibrium states are not with equal probabilities. So it is improper to consider micro-
canonical ensemble as the foundation of equilibrium state theory. For the systems only acted by conservative
forces without considering retarded eﬀects, the canonical ensemble is more foundational. For the general
statistical systems, the revised Liouville’s equation is fundamental. It can be seen from discussions above
that it is more simple and rational to discuss the problems of equilibrium states from the Liouville’s equation
directly, no matter on physical concepts or mathematical calculation.

(F0iσ + Fiσ)] = 0

(26)

This is other equilibrium state. There are other equilibrium states.

For non-isolated systems, we can deﬁnite the equilibrium states as the states that the forces acted on
the systems and the ensemble probabilities functions do not change with time. For example, the equilibrium
state of a system located in the gravitational ﬁeld of earth. The distribution function can still be described by
Eq.(19), but in this case total energy E contains potential energy. In all theses equilibrium states, ensemble
probability densities change with the coordinates of phase space, but do not change with time.

Therefore, it is clear that we can deal with all the problems of statistical physics well from the revised
Liouville’s equation directly. It is unnecessary for us to introduce some extra hypotheses such as the equal
probability hypothesis. At present, chaos theory is also involved when we discuss the problems of foundation

of statistical mechanics. Based on conservative interaction, thought chaos theory may be relative to the ori-
gin of random nature of statistical system or the hypothesis of ensemble, it has no eﬀect on the foundational
form of motion equation of statistical mechanics and has nothing to do with the origin of irreversibility in
macro-systems. So it is impossible to us to solve the fundamental problems of statistical physics depending
on chaos theory. In fact, it is enough for us in principle to solve all problems in statistical physics based on
the revised Liouville’s equation. By the method provided in the paper, the united description of equilibrium
states and non-equilibrium states without using the concepts of ergoden, coarse graining and mixing currents

In order to let the integral is possible, the retarded quantities should be expressed by the non-retarded
quantities or opposite. It is known that the relation between retarted time and particle’s distance is

rij = c(t − t′) =

[xi(t) − x′

j(t′)]2 + [yi(t) − y′

j(t′)]2 + [zi(t) − z′

j(t′)]2

Suppose the function relations xi = xi(t) and x′
above

j = x′

j(t′) are known, it can be obtained from the formula

t = f [x′

j(t′), y′

j(t′), z′

j(t′), t′]

or

t′ = f ′[xi(t), yi(t), zi(t), t]

From the relations, we have

On the other hand, by using relations xi = xi(t), yi = yi(t), zi = zi(t) and Eq.(29), we have

When the particle’s speed v << c, the retarded distance r′

ij (t′) in the retarded time t′ can be replaced

ij (t, t′) =| ~ri(t) − ~r′

It is noted that r′
ij (t) is the approximate retarded distance, but rij (t) is not the retarded
distance. In this case, we can develop retarded quantities into series in light of small quantity rij /c. By
relation ~vj = d~rj/dt, we get (4)

The BBGKY series equations are discussed now. The volume element of phase space of the i-particle is
written as dΩi = Πσ=1dxiσdpiσ and the reduced distribution functions of ensemble probability densities are

It is obvious that after the retarded quantities are expressed by the non-retarded quantities, the conservative
forces would become the non-conservative forces. In the same way, ~G′
ij can also be expressed by the non-
retarded quantities. By using Eq.(46), Eq.(45) can be written as

The deﬁnition of ~Kij can be seen in Eq.(47). We will discuss the motion equations of hydromechanics me-
chanics by using them below.

6 The motion equations of hydromechanics mechanics

How to reduce the motion equations of hydromechanics from statistical mechanics is still a unsolved
problem now. Because the current statistical mechanics is based on the Liouville’s equation, it is only
suitable for the equivalent states of conservative systems or the ideal ﬂuids. The dissipative phenomena of
real ﬂuids just as heat conduction and viscosity and so on can only be explained rationally by introducing
non-conservative forces. Let’s discuss this problem now. By writing the right items of Eq.(50) into the
form of hydromechanics and adding them into the current results, we can get the results after the retarded
Lorentz forces and radiation damping forces are introduced. According to the current theory, we deﬁnite
the normalization of functions f1(~r1.~p1, t) and f2(~r1.~p1, ~r2, ~p2, t) as

V0 =

According to Eq.(14), we have ∇~p1 · ~F ′
12 = 0. Because ~K12 has nothing to do with ~p1, we also have
∇~p1 · ~K12 = 0. By using the boundary conditions of probability density functions, Eq.(50) is zero. So the
continuity equation of hydromechanics is the same as the current form with

In order to get the motion equation of hydromechanics, we product Eq.(50) by N ~p1/V0 and take the

We can call σk as the generation of dissipative kinetic energy.
In the current theory, we have no this
item. It appears only when the retarded Lorentz forces and damping radiation forces are introduced. Let
~Jk = ~Jk1 + ~Jk2 + ~Jk3, thus Eq (73) can be written as

Producing Eq.(51) by N 2U (r12)/V 2

0 and taking the integral about d3~p1d3~r2d3~p2, the equivalent equation

of potential energy can be obtained. Form the left side of the equation, we can get

As mentioned before, we have ∇~p1 · U (rij ) ~Kij = 0 and ∇~p1 · U (r12) ~K ′
ij = 0. By considering the boundary
condition, all integrals are zero. So the potential energy items have no reversion after retarded Lorentz forces
and the radiation damping forces are introduced.

We have to consider the contributions of non-conservative dissipative energies. It is known in electro-
magnetic theory that when the common coordinates and momentums are used to describe particle’s motion,

interaction energy does not contain magnetic ﬁeld’s action. The retarded interaction between the i -particle
and the j -particle is

7. The deﬁnition of non-equivalent entropy of general systems

As well known, though the thermodynamics of equilibrium states had matured since the last stage of
nineteenth century, the general theory of the non-equilibrium systems has not yet been established up to
now. The key to establish the general thermodynamic theory for the non-equilibrium systems is to deﬁne the
correct non-equilibrium entropy. But this is still an unsolved problem now. Though some special theories for
special non-equilibrium processes have deﬁned their non-equilibrium entropies, for example, the irreversible
thermodynamics based on the hypothesis of local equilibrium (7), the extended thermodynamics (8), the
rational thermodynamics (9), as well as the famous Boltzmann’s non-equilibrium entropy, none of them are
with general signiﬁcance.

In the equilibrium thermodynamic, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamic or the law of energy conservation is

In the formula, Q is total heat, E is total internal energy, P is pressure, V is volume and F is external force.
For a single component system, the entropy function S is deﬁned as

dQ = dE + P dV = dE − ~F · d~r

T dS = dE + P dV = dE − ~F · d~r = dQ

Because the concept of absolute temperature is based on equilibrium states, Eq.(132) is only suitable for
equilibrium states. According to irreversible thermodynamics based on the hypothesis of local equilibrium, a
system can be divided into many small cells, and each cell can be regarded as a small equilibrium system in

(129)

(130)

(131)

(132)

(133)

(134)

(135)

(136)

which local equilibrium temperature T (~r, t) can still be deﬁned. Let Sm(~r, t), Em(~r, t), Qm(~r, t) and Em(~r, t)
represent entropy density, internal energy density, heat density and external force density individually, the
total entropy S, total internal energy E, total heat Q and total external force F of a system can be written
as

S(t) =

Sm(~r, t)d3~r

E(t) =

Em(~r, t)d3~r

Q(t) =

Qm(~r, t)d3~r

~F (t) =

~Fm(~r, t)d3~r

Z

Z

Z

The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics and the deﬁnition of entropy can be written as

dQm = dEm − ~Fm · d~r

T dSm = dQm = dEm − ~Fm · d~r

As we known that if the interactions between micro-particles are known, the ensemble probability functions
can be obtained. If the ensemble probability function is known, the heat density or internal energy density
is also known. In this case, the local equilibrium entropy depends on the local equilibrium temperature. In
the current theory of local equilibrium thermodynamics, the function form of local equilibrium temperature
T (~r, t) can’t be determined by theory, but we can decide it through measurement point by point in principle
by means of a small enough thermometer. Then we can determine the function form non-equilibrium entropy
according to Eq.(136).

Because the concepts of temperature and entropy are deﬁned based on the concept of equilibrium, when
the hypothesis of local equilibrium can’t hold, there are argument about whether or not the non-equilibrium
temperature and non-equilibrium entropy can exit at present, thought the concepts of external energy, heat,
and force are meaningful.
It should be seen that the concept of entropy was put forward only for the
purports to describe irreversibility of macro-system’s evolution, so that the second law of thermodynamics
can be expressed in the clear form of mathematics. So it is necessary for us to deﬁne the non-equilibrium
entropy form this angle. The problem is how to deﬁne it, instead of whether or not it exists. For the
deﬁnition of non-equilibrium entropy, two conditions should be satisﬁed. The ﬁrst is that when a system
reaches equilibrium state, the non-equilibrium entropy should identify with the equilibrium entropy deﬁned
in the equilibrium thermodynamics. The second is that the deﬁnition should satisfy the principle of entropy
increment in the non-equilibrium processes. Conversely, if a function can satisfy these two conditions, it can
be regarded as non-equilibrium entropy.

On the other hand, entropy is not a physical quantity that can be measured directly. T the concept of
entropy depends on other quantities by means of them entropy is constructed. If the concepts to construct
entropy are meaningful, entropy is also meaningful. Entropy is also a extensive quantity with additivity. So
we can deﬁne non-equilibrium entropy density, just as we can deﬁne energy density, heat density and forces
density in equilibrium states without considering equilibrium concept.

As for non-equilibrium temperature, the situation is diﬀerent. Temperature is a quantity that can be
measured directly. The concept of temperature depends on equilibrium closely. If equilibrium does not exist,
there is no the concept of temperature, for we can not use thermometer to measure temperature in a non-
equilibrium system in which the hypothesis of local equilibrium loses its meaning. Meanwhile, temperature
is strength quantity. We can’t deﬁne temperature density. The concept of temperature always reﬂects the
whole nature of big enough system. So we can say that the concept of non-equilibrium temperature is
meaningless while the concept of local equilibrium does not hold.

In this way, we do not use the concept of non-equilibrium temperature in the general non-equilibrium
systems. In order to deﬁne non-equilibrium entropy, similar to the local equilibrium entropy and by the
simplest method, we introduce an unknown function R(x, t) and deﬁne non-equilibrium entropy by following
relation for a single component system

RdSm = dQm = dEm − ~Fm · d~r

(137)

Because R is not temperature, it can’t be determined by the point to point’s measurement in system. It is
proved blow that we can decide the form of R function by the method of statistical mechanics, and prove
the entropy increment principle of general non-equivalent systems by the connection of statistical mechanics
and thermodynamic. When systems reach equilibrium states, we have R = T = constant. So the function
Sm deﬁned in Eq.(137) satisﬁes two conditions mentioned above and can be used as the deﬁnition of non-
equilibrium entropy of general systems. It can also be proved at last that the forms of non-equilibrium entropy

and the function R are not unique, so this is also a reason why R can not be regarded as non-equilibrium
temperature. Therefore, according to Eq.(137), we have

Here W (~r, t) = ˙Qm(~r, t)/R(~r, t),
from the state C0 at moment t0, it reaches the state C1 at moment t1. By using Eq.(133), the non-equilibrium
entropy’s increase is

Now let’s discuss how to decide the form of function R. Let f1(x1, p1, t) = f (x, p, t), satisﬁes Eq.(50). In the
6-dimension phase space, the non-equilibrium statistical entropy density is written as SN (~r1 ···~rN , ~p1 ···~pN , t).
In the 6-dimension phase space, the non-equilibrium statistical entropy density is written as S1(x1, p1, t) =

~~Π can be regarded as known quantity. Therefore, as long as the
can also be calculated if f is known. So
probability function f is known by means of statistical physics, we can achieve the form of R function from
Eq.(155) in principle. Thus the forms of non-equilibrium statistical entropy in the 6-dimention phase space
can be determined by Eq.(153) and the form of non-equilibrium thermodynamic entropy can be determined
by Eq.(142). The form of non-equilibrium statistical entropy in the 6N -dimention phase space can also be
determined by Eq.(140) in principle.

The equilibrium states are discussed now. If we deﬁne the states with R =constant as the equilibrium
states, according to Eq.(155), the equilibrium condition is B = 0 . From Eq.(156), by considering the fact
that we have ~V =constant when a system reaches equilibrium states, the equilibrium condition becomes

This means σm = 0 comparing with Eq.(149) when R =constant.

On the other hand, if R has nothing to do with space coordinate ~r but relative to time t, we have
R = R(t) = T (t), T is absolute temperature. Suppose Qm also has nothing to do with space coordinate ~r
but relative to time t, i.e, Qm = Qm(t), because

This is just equilibrium entropy in equilibrium thermodynamics. Therefore, the temperature can be the
functions of time in the processes of equilibrium states, as long as the systems are uniform. The processes
are just the so-called quasi-stationary processes, but this point has not been noted clearly in the current
thermodynamics. It is useful for us to calculate entropy function by using this nature.

Now let we prove the principle of entropy increment in the adiabatic processes. That is to prove the

following relation for the non-equilibrium isolated systems

dS

Z

dQm

d3~r > 0

(160)

In principle, if the distribution function is known, we can prove it directly by the method of statistical
mechanics, but this is impossible at present because of diﬃculty in mathematics. So we prove it by the
method of connecting thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

Firstly, because Qm(t) and R(t) are the continuous functions of time, so S(t) is also a continuous function
of time. Next, suppose an isolated system is in an equilibrium state at time t0. At time t0 + dt a disturbing
force is acted on the system so that the system becomes a non-equilibrium states. Then the disturbing force
is removed immediately and the system would evolutes in the isolated state and reaches another equilibrium
state at time tn. It is impossible to have another equilibrium state between these two equilibrium states.
If there exists the third equilibrium state, it means that the system would become non-equilibrium from
equilibrium without disturbing force form outside. In this case, the second law of thermodynamics would be
violated. Thus, what we should prove is that the entropy would never decrease during the non-equilibrium
process between two equilibrium states. By using the method of reduction to absurdity, we will prove below
that ∆S should be a monotonously increasing function during the whole time t0 → tn.

According to the theory of equilibrium thermodynamics, because the system is in the equilibrium states
at initial and ﬁnal states, we have ∆S = S(tn) − S(t0) > 0. If ∆S does not increase monotonously, when ∆S
changes from dS > 0 to dS < 0 or from dS < 0 to dS > 0, it would appear a state with dS = 0 or dS/dt = 0
at a certain moment ti with t0 < ti<tn. According to equilibrium theory, it means that the system must be
in the equilibrium states at moment ti. However, this is impossible as mention above. On the other hand,
because ~Fm = 0 for an isolated system, we have ˙Qm = ˙Em and get according to Eq.(138)

There are two ways to make Eq.(161) possible. The ﬁrst is ˙Em = 0 or Em =constant. However, this is
impossible for f 6= constant, so Em 6= constant in the non-equilibrium processes. The second way is that
˙Em/R is not a single valued function so that for any boundary condition ~r = ~r1 and ~r = ~r2, we always have

dS

˙Qm

~r1

d3~r = W (~r2, t) − W (~r1, t) = 0

(161)

(162)

However, this condition can’t be satisﬁed generally, for the probability distribution function is a single
valued function in general. So Eq.(161)and (162) can not hold in the non-equilibrium processes in general.
Therefore, dS/dt 6= 0 in non-equilibrium processes and non-equilibrium entropy S must be a monotone
function. On other hand, because ∆S = S(tn) − S(t0) > 0, so during the process from time t0 to tn, S must
be a monotonously increasing function. Thus, the principle of non-equilibrium entropy increment is proved
for the non-equilibrium processes.

At last we discuss the uniqueness problem of the deﬁnition of non-equilibrium entropy. Because probabil-
ity distribution function f is unique, the form of function R is unique, so the form of non-equilibrium entropy
shown in (137) is also unique. On the other hand, if there exists other form’s non-equilibrium entropies S′
m,
we can always deﬁne them as

R′dS′

m = dQm + dYm

(163)

If Ym is an unknown function, the deﬁnition is meaningless for there are three unknown functions and we
can’t decide them by the method mentioned above. If Ym is the function of known functions, for example

energy density, heat density and force density and so on, we can also determinate the forms of S′
m and
R′ by the same method.
m would be the
same as equilibrium entropy in equilibrium state. If Ym and R′ are also the single valued functions and
˙Ym/R′ 6= 0 in non-equilibrium states, we can also prove the principle of non-equilibrium entropy increment.
If all conditions are satisﬁed, we can also consider S′
m as the non-equilibrium entropy density. On the other
hand, from Eq.(137) and (163) we have

If dYm = 0 and R′ = T in equilibrium states, the form of S′

RdS = R′d(S′

Sm(~r, t) =

In this way, both Sm and S′
m can be regarded as non-equilibrium entropy densities connecting by relation
above. So the deﬁnition of non-equilibrium entropy is not unique. This is just the reason why we can deﬁne
diﬀerent non-equilibrium entropies in the current non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Because R 6= R′, so R
can’t be regarded as non-equilibrium temperature, for non-equilibrium temperature as a measurable physical
quantity should be unique if it exists. Because non-equilibrium entropy is directly immeasurable, so it can
be non-unique. In this way, non-equilibrium entropy is not a state function and its increment can also be
non-unique, thought equilibrium entropy is a state function and its increment is unique.

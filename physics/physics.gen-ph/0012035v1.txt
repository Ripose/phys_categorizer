Time Reversal Symmetry Not Exist Actually
In the Theories of Particle Interactions

( Institute of Theoretical Physics in Fuzhou, No.303, Building 2, Yinghu Garden,

Abstract

It is pointed out that the judgment condition of time reversal symmetry in the processes of particle
interaction is that the Hamiltioians of systems satisfy the relation ˆH(t) = ˆH ∗(
t). But this condition
can not be satisﬁed actually in the current interaction theories, so the symmetry of time reversal does
not exist actually in the current theories of particle interactions. In the current proof of time reversal
symmetry, the relation ˆH(t) = ˆH ∗(
t) is supposed to exist in advance, then the translation relations
between the time reversal operator and the ﬁeld quantities are deduced. So the current proof about
the symmetry of time reversal is not a real one.

Here b is a constant. We can take b = 1 for simpliﬁcation. But ψ(x,

seems that the positive process is diﬀerent from the reversal process. However, because the wave
function can not be directly measured, what can be done is the possibility density ρ. Suppose
ρ(x, t) = ψ∗(x, t)ψ(x, t) is the possibility density of the positive process, the possibility density of
the time reversal process is ρ(x,
t)ψ(x,

chanics is unchanged under the time reversal, we have ψ∗(x,

There are two kinds of schemes about time reversal in the theory of particle physics at present
(1) One is to deﬁne the operator of time reversal as an antiunitary operator shown in Eq.(5). The
transformation relations of scalar ﬁeld, vector ﬁeld and spinor ﬁeld under time reversal are deﬁned as
follows individually.

Another scheme of time reversal is the so-called Wigner transformation. The antiunitary operator
is also involved. The transformation form is more complex. But it is unnecessary for us to discuss it
here any more.

It is commonly believed that the time reversal invariability in the current theories of particle
interactions has been proved. However, it can be seen that this kind of proof is not a real one.
Because in the current proof, the relation ˆH(t) = ˆH ∗(
t) is supposed to exist in advance without
providing the proof of the relation, then the translation relations of the ﬁelds are deduced. That is
to say, the theory has been supposed unchanged in advance under time reversal. However, what we
should do is to prove the relation ˆH(t) = ˆH ∗(
t) at ﬁrst if the theory is invariable under time reversal
considering the fact that in quantum theory of ﬁeld, the motion equation (9) is completely the same
as that in quantum mechanics shown in Eq.(1). As shown below, however, it can easy be proved that
this condition can not be satisﬁed actually in the current theories of particle interactions.

Besides, the current scheme of time reversal has other problems shown below.

deﬁnition of time reversal with T Hm(t)T −1 = Hm(

We have taken T iψ(x, t) = iT ψ(x, t) in the process. In this scheme, the operator of time reversal

expressed in Eq.5. Let ψ′(x, t) represent the wave function of time reversal with ψ′(x, t) = T ψ(x, t),

This transformation is unique to keep the motion equation unchanged under the time reversal for free
spinor ﬁeld. However, this transformation is obviously diﬀerent from Eq. 7.

As for the Wigner transformation considered as another scheme of time reversal, besides too big
diﬀerences between these two schemes so that we can not decide what kind of scheme represents
the real situation, the similar problems shown above are also exist. The discussion of time reversal
problem is very chaotic in the current particle physics. It lacks of identity or united standard. We have
to use the diﬀerent transforms in the diﬀerent situation. In fact, according to the Noether theorem
each kind of symmetry transformation of a system corresponding to a conservative quantity. But in
the quantum theory of ﬁeld, no conservative quantum can be found corresponding to time reversal
transformation. This fact actually has shown that the symmetry of time reversal does not exist in the
theory of particle physics.

1. According to this scheme, the operator of time reversal is anti-unitary. But it is considered
in general that only unitary operator can be observable, the anti-unitary operator is meaningless in
physics.

2.According to this scheme, after the transformation of time reversal is carried out, the producing
operators of particles are still the producing operators, the annihilating operators of particles are still
the annihilating operators (1,2) with T α†(p, s)T −1 = α†(
p, s). This result
does not represent the real situation. In the processes of time reversal, the production and annihilation
operators of particles should be exchanged each other.

In sum, the invariability of time reversal does not exist actually in the current theories of particle

physics, so the current theory of time reversal should be reestablished.

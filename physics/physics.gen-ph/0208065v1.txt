A dense gas of cesium atoms at the crossover to two-dimensionality is prepared in a highly
anisotropic surface trap that is realized with two evanescent light waves. Temperatures as low as
100 nK are reached with 20.000 atoms at a phase-space density close to 0.1. The lowest quantum
state in the tightly conﬁned direction is populated by more than 60%. The system oﬀers intriguing
prospects for future experiments on degenerate quantum gases in two dimensions.

Systems with reduced dimensionality have attracted
considerable attention in various areas of physics as they
exhibit strikingly diﬀerent properties in comparison to
the three-dimensional case. In the ﬁeld of atomic quan-
tum gases, there has been long-standing interest in two-
dimensional systems in view of the phase transition to a
quantum-degenerate gas [1], the onset of coherence [2],
and modiﬁcations of interaction properties [3]. Spin-
polarized hydrogen on a liquid-helium surface represents
a 2D quantum gas as the adsorbed atoms occupy a single
quantum state [4], and evidence of quantum degeneracy
has been obtained [5]. The required cryogenic set-up and
the lack of eﬃcient optical diagnostics, however, makes
detailed experimental studies on 2D gases of hydrogen
very diﬃcult, and thus there is great interest to realize
analogous systems by using more readily accessible laser-
manipulated atoms.

Few experiments with laser-cooled atoms have so far
approached 2D. In standing-wave traps conditions were
obtained with the predominant population of the low-
est quantum state in one dimension [6, 7, 8].
In such
traps, however, many individual traps are populated si-
multaneously so that phenomena related to individual
systems are hardly accessible. Another approach is an
anisotropic optical trap made of an elliptically focused
laser beam and loaded with a Bose-Einstein condensate
[9]; this trap however is diﬀraction-limited and thus pro-
vides relatively small level spacing. Optical surface traps
combine tight conﬁnement in one direction with a sin-
gle potential well. Recent surface trapping experiments
[10, 11] have approached 2D by populating a few bound
states, yet far away from quantum degeneracy.

In this Letter, we report on trapping and evaporative
cooling of a dense gas of Cs atoms in the combined ﬁeld
of two evanescent light waves. In this highly anisotropic
surface trap, evaporative cooling is performed by ramp-
ing down the trap potential, and temperatures as low as
100 nK are reached with 20.000 atoms at a phase-space
density close to 0.1. In the tightly conﬁned direction a
ground-state population of more than 60% is achieved,
and a gas at the crossover to two-dimensionality is real-
ized.

tials normal to the surface in the trap center. The attractive
van-der-Waals part at short distances (z <∼ 100 nm) is not
shown. The solid lines refer to diﬀerent values of the power Pr
of the laser beam generating the attractive EW. The dashed
line shows the potential for Pr = 0.

The double evanescent-wave trap (DEW trap, see illus-
tration in Fig. 1) was suggested by Ovchinnikov, Shul’ga,
and Balykin already in 1991 [12] and has been discussed
in various contexts, like 2D gases [13, 14], atom coupling
to microspheres [15], cavity-induced cooling [16], quan-
tum reﬂection [17], integrated optical waveguides [18],
and nano-traps [19]. Despite of this considerable inter-
est, the DEW trap has not been experimentally realized
until now, which may be explained by the diﬃculty of
loading a narrow potential well very close to a material
wall. We have accomplished eﬃcient loading by trans-
fer from a cold and dense reservoir of cesium atoms. In
our case, this is provided by the non-dissipative optical
surface trap introduced in Ref. [20]. The demonstrated
principle of loading from a dense reservoir is universal

and may be also implemented with other optical or mag-
netic trapping schemes.

The DEW trap relies on the optical dipole force in a
combination of a repulsive and an attractive EW ﬁeld,
produced on the surface of a dielectric prism by total in-
ternal reﬂection of two laser beams. The two ﬁelds with
wavelengths λi (i = r, b) are created by laser sources
tuned below and above the atomic transition (red and
blue detuning), respectively. Normal to the surface the
two ﬁelds decay exponentially with characteristic lengths
2
θi − 1)−1/2, determined by the
of Λi = λi/2π × (n2 sin
angle of incidence θi, the optical wavelength λi, and the
refractive index n. A narrow, wavelength-sized potential
well is created close to the surface when the decay length
Λb of the repulsive EW is short compared to Λr of the at-
tractive ﬁeld. This is reached by setting the red-detuned
laser beam near to the critical angle θc = arcsin(1/n) of
total internal reﬂection and the blue one much further
away. Typical angles are θr − θc of a few tens of a degree
and θb − θc of a few degrees. In addition to this tight
conﬁnement normal to the surface, lateral conﬁnement is
achieved when the extension of the attractive EW ﬁeld is
smaller than the one of the repulsive EW ﬁeld; this can
be obtained by an appropriate choice of the Gaussian
beam waists wi of the two applied laser beams.

In our experiment, the repulsive EW is generated with
the beam of a Titanium-Sapphire laser at a wavelength of
λb = 850.5 nm (1.6nm blue detuning with respect to the
Cs D2 line at 852.1 nm). The angle of incidence is set to
θb = 46.8◦, i.e. 3.2◦ above the critical angle of the fused-
silica prism (n = 1.45). The beam for the attractive EW
is derived from an Yb ﬁber laser with λr = 1064 nm and
set to 0.2◦ above θc. The resulting decay lengths are
Λb = 395 nm and Λr = 2.0 µm. The beams are focused
to waists of wb = 400µm and wr = 160µm.

The total trap potential can be written as

the optical potentials directly at the surface (z = 0).
For the maximum potentials in the center of the trap
we calculate ˆUb/kB = 325 µK and ˆUr/kB = 43 µK at
typical beam powers of Pb = 1.15 W and Pr = 1.2 W,
respectively; kB denotes Boltzmann’s constant. The
laser beams are linearly polarized in the plane of in-
cidence (TM polarization) to maximize the EW ﬁeld.
The third term in Eq. 1 describes the van der Waals
surface attraction [21, 22] with a coeﬃcient αvdW =
2.8 × 10−49 kg m5 s−2 and an eﬀective wavelength λeﬀ =
866 nm corresponding to the line center of the D-line
dublett; this surface attraction is found to play a mi-
nor role for our experimental conditions. The last term
in Eq. 1 represents the gravitational potential with m
denoting the mass of a Cs atom and g representing the
gravitational acceleration.

Fig. 1 shows the calculated potential in the center of
the trap (x, y = 0). For Pr = 1.2 W, the power that
we use for loading, a 13 µK deep well is realized with
its minimum located 0.9µm away from the surface. For
decreasing power of the attractive EW the well becomes
shallower and the minimum moves away from the sur-
face. Without attractive EW (dashed line) the vertical
motion is still conﬁned because of gravity, but without
any horizontal conﬁnement.

The multi-stage loading sequence proceeds as follows:
Atoms are released from a magneto-optical trap (MOT)
into the gravito-optical surface trap (GOST) of Ref. [23],
where an unpolarized sample in the lower hyperﬁne state
(F = 3) is produced by evanescent-wave Sisyphus cool-
ing. A part of the atoms is then transfered through elastic
collisions into a narrow, far-detuned intense laser beam
perpendicularly intersecting the evanescent-wave in the
center of the GOST [20]; this beam has a Gaussian beam
waist of 160µm and is derived with an initial power of
7.2 W from the same Yb-ﬁber laser that later on pro-
duces the attractive ﬁeld of the DEW trap. The repul-
sive evanescent wave applied at this stage is already the
one that is later used in the DEW trap. The sample is
then further cooled adiabatically and evaporatively by
exponentially ramping down the power of the horizon-
tally conﬁning beam to 2 W in 2 s. In this way, we obtain
our surface reservoir of 1.8 × 106 atoms at a temperature
of 3.0 µK, corresponding to a peak number density of
∼1013 cm−3. The peak phase-space density is ∼10−3 un-
der the assumption of a fully unpolarized sample equally
distributed among the seven magnetic sublevels.

Transfer into the DEW trap from the reservoir is then
accomplished in a time interval of 50 ms by ramping down
the power of the red-detuned beam from 2 W to zero
simultaneously with ramping up the power of the at-
tractive EW from zero to the optimum loading power
Pr = 1.2 W. The lateral conﬁnement of the reservoir
beam and the DEW trap are approximately matched,
so that the loading process is governed by the vertical
motion. Up to 105 atoms are observed in the DEW trap
after 150 ms when the unbound atoms remaining from
the reservoir have laterally escaped. Measurements of
the atom number are performed by recapture into the
MOT and detection of the integrated ﬂuorescence signal
by means of a calibrated CCD camera; the systematic
calibration error is below a factor of 1.5. The observed
transfer ratio of ∼5% roughly corresponds to the volume
ratio of the DEW trap and the reservoir.

A very important parameter is the vertical trap fre-
quency νz, corresponding to the vibrational energy quan-
tum hνz in the tightly conﬁned direction. We measure
the trap frequency as a function of the power Pr by para-
metric heating [24]. After loading the DEW trap under
ﬁxed conditions (Pr = 1.2 W), we ramp Pr to a vari-
able value in 50 ms and apply a sinusoidal power modu-
lation with a typical depth of 10% to the repulsive EW

3

The sample then undergoes a ballistic expansion in the
ﬁeld of gravity and atoms hitting the room-temperature
surface are immediately lost. After a short release time
the repulsive EW is turned on again to prevent further
atoms from hitting the surface, and the number of re-
maining atoms is measured in the standard way by re-
capture into the MOT. A theoretical model based on the
assumption of a thermal distribution in the known trap
potential is then used to ﬁt the data with a single param-
eter and thus to accurately determine the mean kinetic
energy of the released sample. At temperatures down
to a few 100 nK a classical approximation holds and the
model directly provides the temperature. At lower tem-
peratures the quantum nature of the vertical motion has
to be taken into account. We ﬁnd that, for all measure-
ments reported here, corrections to the classical approx-
imation due to the zero-point energy and the discrete
level spacing stay well below 20% and can be introduced
within a simple harmonic oscillator model. Fig. 3 shows
two examples of temperature measurements obtained for
a ‘hot’ (2.7 µK) and a ‘cold’ (100 nK) sample.

Forced evaporative cooling is implemented by ramping
down the power Pr of the attractive EW. In this way, a
two-dimensional evaporation scheme is realized in which
energetic atoms can escape horizontally from the trap. In
the vertical direction no evaporation can take place be-
cause of the gravitational potential. The scheme decom-
presses the sample and provides simultaneous adiabatic
and evaporative cooling; thus a drastic reduction of the
temperature is realized.
Immediately after loading we
apply an exponential ramp that reduces Pr to 3.5% of its
initial value in 400 ms. As it takes about 150 ms for the
untrapped reservoir atoms to disappear, we can perform
measurements on the number N and temperature T of
the trapped sample for evaporation times tev ≥ 150 ms.
Fig. 4 displays the forced evaporation results. For tev
between 150 ms (Pr reduced to 28%) and 300 ms (8%),
an exponential decay of the trapped atom number N is
observed. In this time interval, the temperature drops
from ∼1µK to ∼100 nK. For 150 ms ≤ tev ≤ 270 ms the
phase-space density D of the sample increases by two or-
ders of magnitude from ∼10−3 to ∼0.1 with a reduction
of N by only a factor of three. This indicates a highly ef-
ﬁcient evaporation process at this stage. At tev ≈ 270 ms
the temperature data level oﬀ at T ≈ 100 nK, and for
tev ≥ 300 ms an increased loss is observed and reliable
temperature measurements are no longer possible. The
highest attained phase-space densities are of the order of
0.1, when an equal distribution among the seven mag-
netic sublevels is assumed. This compares to the highest
phase-space densities so far obtained with cesium [25].

In view of a 2D gas, we discuss the results in terms
of a reduced temperature τ = kBT /hνz by relating the
thermal energy to the vibrational energy quantum of the
tightly conﬁned direction. For this purpose, we use the
calculated νz(Pr) as displayed in Fig. 2(b). The lower

for 150 ms. We then wait 100 ms to let unbound atoms
escape and measure the number of remaining atoms. A
typical trap-frequency measurement is shown in Fig. 2(a)
for Pr = 0.9 W, it exhibits clear minima at the trap fre-
quency and its second harmonics. Fig. 2(b) shows the
measured values for the trap frequency in comparison
with the results of a calculation according to Eq. 1; the
latter is based on a harmonic approximation to the mini-
mum of the trap potential U (r) which we calculate for our
experimental conditions without any adjustable parame-
ter. The measurements are aﬀected by the lateral ther-
mal spread of the sample and by anharmonicities of the
trap and therefore show an sample-averaged frequency
which is slightly below the frequencies in the trap cen-
ter.
If this minor deviation is taken into account the
measurements well conﬁrm the theoretical frequencies.
At Pr = 1.2 W, we calculate a vertical trap frequency of
10.2 kHz and horizontal frequencies of 59 Hz and 42 Hz.
The typical aspect ratio of the trap is thus of the order
of 200.

The temperature of the sample is measured with
a release-and-recapture method. Both EW ﬁelds are
turned oﬀ simultaneously by acousto-optical modulators.

full optical access and magnetically tunable interactions.
In conclusion, we have realized a cold and dense gas of
Cs atoms in a highly anisotropic optical trap with intrigu-
ing prospects for experiments on 2D quantum gases. By
evaporative cooling we have already reached conditions
at the crossover to two-dimensionality. With further im-
provements the system opens up a new road to study the
fascinating and widely unexplored properties of degener-
ate quantum gases in two dimensions.

FIG. 4: Results of evaporative cooling in the DEW trap. Up-
per graph, temperature T and atom number N versus evapo-
ration time. Lower graph, reduced temperature τ = kBT /hνz
and phase-space density D.

graph of Fig. 4 shows that we are presently able to reach
the condition τ = 1. This already corresponds to a
mean vibrational quantum number of ¯n = 0.58 and a
ground state population of 63%. Thus a situation at the
crossover to a 2D atom gas is reached.

Our experiment is presently limited by two main fac-
tors: First, the unpolarized Cs sample in the F = 3
ground state is not stable against inelastic two-body col-
lisions [26], which leads to heating and trap loss. Second,
the horizontal-vertical thermalization by elastic collisions
becomes ineﬃcient for τ <∼ 1 [8]. In our horizontal evap-
oration scheme this inhibits vertical cooling when two-
dimensionality is appoached and may thus explain our
present limitation to τ ≈ 1.

In future experiments, both limitations can be over-
come by polarizing the atoms into the lowest substate
(F = 3, m = 3). The polarized sample will be stable
against two-body decay and, moreover, oﬀers magnetic
tunability of s-wave scattering by low-ﬁeld Feshbach res-
onances [27]. Gravity can be compensated by using mag-
netic gradients so that atoms can be evaporated vertically
out of the trap. With these modiﬁcations, quantum de-
generacy of cesium may be reached in the DEW trap
under conditions where the trap supports just a single
vertical bound state. This would constitute a unique
system with strong analogies to H on liquid He, but with

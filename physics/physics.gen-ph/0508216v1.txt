The geometric phases in physics represent a large class
of phenomena having experimental manifestation in some
cases. The landmark papers that stimulated interest in
this subject are those of Aharonov and Bohm [1] and
Berry [2]. There has been an incessant debate on the ori-
gin of these phases: quantum or classical? Horsley and
Babiker [3] claim to have given a (semi-)classical deriva-
tion of what they term as ‘R¨ontgen phase’. This phase
could be viewed as dual to the Aharonov-Casher phase [4]
such that the motion of a neutral particle possessing an
electric dipole moment is considered in the ﬁeld of a mag-
netic line charge [5]. In a nice analysis Wilkens [5] shows
that Aharanov-Bohm like topological phase arises due to
the R¨ontgen interaction term when the dipole moves in
a force free region.
In this comment I argue that the
principal claim of [3] is misleading.

The main contribution of [3] is based on the following:
1) a cumulative impulse vector is introduced, 2) for the
radial force, Eq.(2) in [3], and the assumed circular mo-
tion of the dipole in the xy plane, the y-component of
the impulse vector is calculated, and 3) the diﬀerence in
the displacement along the y direction is identiﬁed with
It is obvious that appearance of sinθ
the phase shift.
in the integrand for the impulse is responsible for the
non-zero displacement along y direction. Since this func-
tion i.e. sinθ would arise in any problem that has radial
force, the electric dipole-magnetic line charge or magnetic
dipole-electric charge construction is irrelevant, and the
check on Aharonov-Casher phase is trivial. The authors
do not give any physical justiﬁcation or motivation for
introducing the key element: cumulative impulse vector.
Note that in the classical collision problems, for instance,
the instantaneous impulse forces are considered such that
the instant force acts conserving the linear momentum.
In the problem of dipole motion, if at all necessary, one
may invoke impulse assuming that the force is suddenly
switched on. But there would be no cumulative impulse
vector.

I think an important paper where the impulse approxi-
mation has been used on physical grounds is that of elec-
tric charge and monopole scattering problem by Gold-
haber [6]. I have realized after reading this paper that
the role of angular momentum in the geometric phases
might be of fundamental importance. Berry in his paper
[2] found a monopole of strength -1/2 located at the de-
generacy for a typical Hamiltonian depending on three
parameters.
In an extensive elaboration and beautiful
analysis Aitchison [7] discusses monopole-like structure

of strength - n/2, and interprets Dirac quantization con-
dition with the spin of the system. In [6] spinless charge
and spinless monopole scattering is considered, and the
scattering angle is calculated for large impact parame-
ter in the impulse approximation. A surprising result is
obtained, namely the azimuthal dependence of the scat-
tering amplitude. An intriguing remark is made by Gold-
haber:” This brings out an important distinction between
classical and quantum theory. In a classical theory with
an arbitrary force law there is no reason to expect a con-
served total angular momentum, even if energy and lin-
ear momentum are conserved. In quantum theory, gen-
eral invariance requirements, combined with the linear-
ity of the theory, guarantee the existence of a J which
commutes with the S matrix”. Now the azimuthal de-
pendence is compensated introducing an extra factor χ
,and this is related with spin as well as Dirac quantiza-
tion. The spin is not an intrinsic property of monopole
or electron, but depends on both.
Is this spin related
with the geometric phase as conjectured in [8] ? I think
the diﬀerence between classical and quantum description
arises as we begin with the force laws such that in the
force-free and torque-free states the constant momentum
and angular momentum states respectively are treated
as equivalent. We have argued that Aharonov-Bohm ef-
fect and Berry phase might be the manifestations of the
inequivalence of these states [9]. The tentative sugges-
tions may be of use to consider the scattering-oriented
approach to the problem discussed in [3]

A simple illustrative example where time dependent
angle occurs naturally is that of Foucault pendulum. A
geometric phase, Hannay angle, is found in this case, see
[10]. Holstein has rightly remarked that the classical ex-
planation given by Boyer [11] for the Aharonov-Casher
phase has been disputed by Aharonov et al [12], “assert-
ing that any change in momentum associated with this
‘classical lag’ eﬀect goes into the internal momentum of
the particle rather than into modifying its kinetic mo-
mentum”. The letter by Horsley and Babiker further ne-
glects dipole-dipole interaction without making a relative
estimate of all the forces that are to be included in prin-
ciple. Though introduction of the Planck constant ’by
hand’ does not necessarily imply quantum implication, I
do believe that a semi-classical explanation [3] could oﬀer
useful insights.

In conclusion, the main claim of the authors in [3],
namely the classical origin of the R¨ontgen phase, is ar-
gued to be unfounded.

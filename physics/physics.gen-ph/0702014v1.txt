SIMPLE DERIVATION OF SCHWARZSCHILD,
LENSE-THIRRING, REISSNER-NORDSTR ¨OM,
KERR AND KERR-NEWMAN METRICS

Marcelo Samuel Berman

I. Introduction

Shortly after the appearance of Einstein’s General Relativistic ﬁeld equations, the ﬁrst

static and spherically symmetric solution became available:

it was Schwarzschild’s metric

(Schwarzschild, 1916). It described the gravitational ﬁeld around a point like mass M .

Afterwards, the ﬁrst rotational metric was developed: Lense-Thirring solution (Thirring and

Lense, 1918). It described the ﬁeld around a rotating sphere at the origin. Nevertheless, it

was only an approximate solution, that only represented a weak ﬁeld, in the slow rotation

case. Reissner and Nordstr¨om’s metric, generalized Schwarzschild’s by charging the mass

source in the origin.

It was only in the sixties of last century, that a rigorous solution

representing the rotation of a central mass, was discovered by Roy Kerr, in what is now

called Kerr’s metric (Kerr, 1963). Immediately afterwards, the generalization to a charged

rotating central mass was supplied, which is now called Kerr-Newman’s metric (Newman et

al. 1965).

The literature on black holes is, by now, very extensive. In recent times, some elementary

books have appeared, which intend to teach beginners without using thoroughly, its natural

tool, i.e., tensor calculus. (For instance: Taylor and Wheeler, 2000; or, Raine and Thomas,

2005). Nevertheless,

it has been lacking a simple derivation of any of those metrics, without

the use of sophisticated mathematics. Taylor and Wheeler (2000) refer to an article about the

impossibility of a simple derivation of the Schwarzschild’s metric (Gruber et al., 1988). While

preparing a new textbook (Berman, to appear), I have made some elementary derivations,

now being presented here.

II. Simple Derivation of Schwarzschild’s metric

From Special Relativity, we know that in the absence of gravitation, the metric is given

by:

2

ds2 = c2dt2 − dσ2 = c2dt2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2 = c2dt2 − dr2 − r2dΩ

,

(II.1)

where,

dΩ = dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2

.

In the above, (x, y, z) and (r, θ, φ) are Cartesian and spherical coordinates, respectively.

When a gravitational ﬁeld appears, the metric is ”curved”, but in the static, spherically

symmetric case, we can write generally that:

ds2 = g00c2dt2 − grrdr2 − r2dΩ

,

where, g00 and

grr

should be functions depending on the mass M and the radial

coordinate r .

In order to estimate the ﬁrst function, we consider a ﬁxed event (dr = dθ = dφ = 0). In

this case, the proper time is given by ds2 ≡ dτ 2 :

dτ 2 = g00c2dt2

.

In the above,

dt

represents coordinate time, i.e., the time far from the central mass

distribution (call it, the time for a clock at inﬁnity). From the Principle of Equivalence, we

know that the relation between coordinate time, and the proper time, as measured close to

a mass distribution, is given by:

dτ ∼= dt
[1+ GM
c2R ]

On squaring the last expression, we ﬁnd:

dτ 2 ∼=

1 − 2GM
c2R (cid:3)
(cid:2)

c2dt2

.

.

(1 + ∆)n ∼= 1 + n∆

.

It is to be noticed, that the gravitational ﬁeld being weak, we could use the approximation:

The interested reader, can ﬁnd elementary accounts of the above, in Sexl and Sexl (1979).

In that reference, however, the reader will ﬁnd that it is not possible to derive the corre-

sponding change in coordinate length, from proper length, without delving into elaborated

mathematics. The reader can check, that we now have obtained g00 :

(II.2)

(II.3)

(II.4)

(II.5)

(II.6)

(II.7)

g00

∼=

1 − 2GM
c2R (cid:3)
(cid:2)

.

(II.8)

On remembering that a weak gravitational ﬁeld does not diﬀer much from its Minkowski

metric counterpart, as shown in (II.1), we make the hypothesis that the determinant of the

metric tensor, which in this case is diagonal, is approximately Minkowskian,

g = −1,

in Cartesian coordinates, or,

g = −R4 sin2 θ

,

in spherical coordinates.

In our case, this implies in that:

g = g00gRRgθθgφφ

∼= −R4 sin2 θ

,

in spherical coordinates.

As we have already found g00 , we now have at our disposal the result:

gRR = (g00)

−1 ∼=

−1

1 − 2GM
c2R (cid:3)

(cid:2)

,

and , unaltered,

(II.9)

(II.10)

dΩ = dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2

.

The last one, implies that ,

gθθ = R2

,

and,

gφφ = R2 sin2 θ .

Though we derived an approximation, our result is, in fact, exact; the Schwarzschild’s

metric is given, then, by:

ds2 =

1 − 2GM
c2R (cid:3)
(cid:2)

c2dt2 −

1 − 2GM
c2R (cid:3)

(cid:2)

−1 dr2 − r2dΩ

,

(II.11)

When the ﬁeld is indeed weak, we write the above in the following form:

4

ds2 ∼=

1 − 2GM
c2R (cid:3)

(cid:2)

c2dt2 −

1 + 2GM
c2R (cid:3)

(cid:2)

dr2 − r2dΩ

,

(II.12)

It is a pity that only about a century after its ﬁrst derivation, we could ﬁnd a solution

for it without tensor calculus.

III. Isotropic form of Schwarzschild’s metric

It is desirable that Schwarzschild’s metric be cast in the isotropic form, which is meant

by:

ds2 = g00c2dt2 − gσσ dσ2

.

In order to ﬁnd the correct isotropic form, we imagine that we make a change in coordi-

nates, from R to ρ , and that we wish to ﬁnd the relation between both, so that, when we

begin with the standard Schwarzschild’s metric (II.11), we ﬁnd the isotropic metric:

ds2 = h1 − 2GM

c2ρ i c2dt2 −h1 + 2GM

c2ρ i dσ2

,

with,

dσ2 = dρ2 + ρ2dΩ

.

We took the g00 = g00(ρ)

to be the same function as g00(R) ; it could work or not. In

fact, it works.

We go right to the solution of the problem:

R ∼= h1 + 2GM
c2ρ i

ρ ∼= h1 + GM

c2ρ i ρ ∼= ρ + GM

c2

.

1
2

With the above substitution, in the metric (III.2), we obtain,

ds2 = h1 − 2GM

c2ρ i c2dt2 − h1 + 2GM

c2ρ i [dρ2 + ρ2dΩ]

.

(III.1)

(III.2)

(III.3)

(III.4)

(III.5)

In the same level of approximation, the last form of the metric, is indistinguishable from

the following one, which is the exact isotropic form of Schwarzschild’s metric:

ds2 = h

2

1− GM

2c2ρ i
2c2ρ i

1+ GM
h

4
2 c2dt2 − h1 + GM
2c2ρi

[dρ2 + ρ2dΩ]

,

(III.6)

5

IV. Simple derivation of Lense-Thirring metric

For a rotating central mass, we start ﬁrst with the approximate isotropic metric of last

Section (relation III.5):

ds2 = h1 − 2GM

c2ρ i c2dt2 − h1 + 2GM

c2ρ i [dρ2 + ρ2dΩ]

.

(IV.1)

Consider now a transformation from the above spherical coordinates,

ρ , θ , φ , to a

rotating frame, deﬁned by the new coordinates R , θ , ˜φ , whereby:

R = ρ

,

˜φ = φ − ω t

,

d ˜φ = dφ − ω dt

.

(cid:2)

, (IV.3)

where,

U = GM
c2R

.

The new expression for the metric, will be:

ds2 =

1 − 2U − (1 + 2U) ω2R2 sin2 θ

c2dt2 − (1 + 2U) dσ2 + 2 (1 + 2U) ωR2 sin2 θ dφ dt

(cid:3)

Note that we have dropped the tilde from φ .

Consider now the greatest diﬀerence between the last metric and the non-rotating one,

i.e., the existence of a non-diagonal metric element,

2 (1 + 2U) ωR2 sin2 θ dφ dt

.

We can deﬁne a Newtonian angular momentum J , so that:

2 (1 + 2U) ωR2 sin2 θ dφ dt = 2 (1 + 2U) J

2M dφ dt

.

It is easy to check that we have employed a natural deﬁnition for J , in the above

equation. As U and J , are small, so that the rotating metric is very approximately

similar to the non-rotating one, we may also write:

6

(IV.2a)

(IV.2b)

(IV.2c)

(IV.4)

(IV.5)

(IV.6)

gφt dφ dt = 2 (1 + 2U) ωR2 sin2 θ dφ dt = (1 + 2U) J

M dφ dt ∼=

J

M + 2GJ
R (cid:3)

(cid:2)

dφ dt

.

(IV.7)

By the same token, the extra term in g00 , is given by the product of ω with the

non-diagonal metric coeﬃcient

gφt

, i.e.,

(IV.8)

ω

J

M + 2GJ
R (cid:3)

(cid:2)

,

which can be neglected.

The above results constitute the Lense-Thirring metric, which we now have shown to be

derived with simple mathematics.

V. Simple derivation of Reissner-Nordstr¨oms metric

Consider now a statical spherically symmetric metric, representing a charged mass M .

We keep the same requirement adopted in order to obtain Schwarzschild’s metric, because

it is still the same argument:

g = g00gRRgθθgφφ = −R4 sin2 θ

(as in Minkowski’s metric)

.

(V.1)

As the part in dΩ is to be kept intact, we are going to write down a standard metric
−1 ; because the given metric has to reduce to Schwarzschild’s one,

form, with g00 = (gRR)

in case Q = 0 , where Q is the electric charge, we may write:

g00

∼=

1 − 2GM
(cid:2)

c2R + kQnRmcsGp

(cid:3)

(V.2)

The third term in the r.h.s. above, was written with the understanding that only charge,

radial distance, and the constants c

and G , can have any inﬂuence in the sought

metric. There is a point that makes the electric case diﬀerent from the gravitational part:

the result should not change when a positive charge is substituted by a negative one. We

impose then, that n is even; it should also be positive, so that increasing the charge, will

increase the change in the metric , when compared with the Schwarzschild’s one, for k > 1 .

From simplicity arguments, we would like to choose the smallest positive and even number:

.

7

n = 2 . One more thing: the relative dependence of the constants, in the Q term, must

be similar to the ones in the M term: this makes us impose that:

(V.3)

(V.4)

(V.5)

(V.6)

m = −n

s = −2n

,

.

p = 1

.

If k is a pure number, and because the whole term is also, dimensionally speaking,

another pure number, we must impose altogether,

The Reissner-Nordstr¨om temporal metric coeﬃcient, is now in the form:

g00

∼=

1 − 2GM
(cid:2)

c2R + kQ2R−2c−4G

(cid:3)

.

We choose now k = 1 . The reason for that, is that there should be a balance between

the second and the third terms of the r.h.s. above: then, k could not be very large or very

small. Ultimately, this value for k is the one that would yield the correct formula for the

electric ﬁeld of the charge, in case we would reverse the calculation, by ﬁnding Einstein’s

tensor, from the given metric, and comparing with the energy momentum tensor for the

given electric ﬁeld. So, k = 1 . We now write our ﬁnal result:

ds2 = h1 − 2GM

c2R + GQ2

c4R2 i c2dt2 −h1 − 2GM

c2R + GQ2
c4R2 i

−1

dR2 −R2dΩ

.

(V.7)

VI. Simple ”derivation” of Kerr’s metric

We ”derive” here, from Lense-Thirring approximate metric, (referring to a rotating black

hole and in the slow rotating case), the general case of a rotating mass metric. The derivation

goes from the approximate case, towards the correct generalization; the ultimate recognition,

that our derivation is correct, lies in intricate mathematical calculations, which we will not

present here; we direct the reader to Adler et al. (1975), for the exact derivation.

From Section IV, we may write a rotating metric (Lense-Thirring), ﬁnding:

ds2 = (cid:16)1 − 2m

˜ρ (cid:17) dt2 − (cid:16)1 + 2m

˜ρ (cid:17) dσ2 − 4ma

˜ρ sin2 θ dφ dt

,

(VI.1)

where m = GM
c2

. Notice that in some places, we make c = 1 .

8

The reader can check, that, in the approximation m

˜ρ << 1 , which characterizes L.T.

metric, the above expression is equivalent also to:

ds2 =

2

2 ˜ρ )
(1− m
(1+ m
2 ˜ρ )

2 dt2 − (cid:16)1 + m

2˜ρ (cid:17) dσ2 − 4ma
˜ρ(1+ m
2 ˜ρ )

sin2 θ dφ dt

.

(VI.2)

This is essentially what we are looking for, in the isotropic form. We now go to standard

form. The reader can check that the desired form is:

ds2 = (cid:16)1 − 2m

ρ (cid:17) dt2−(cid:16)1 − 2m
ρ (cid:17)

dρ2 −ρ2(dθ2 +sin2 θ dφ2)− 4ma
ρ

sin2 θ dφ dt

.

(VI.3)

−1

The above relation being valid for

ρ2 >> a2

, it could be derived, by imposing this

approximation, from the exact relation:

ds2 = ∆

dt − a sin2 θdφ

where ∆ , ρ , and a are deﬁned by:

ρ2 ≡ r2 + a2 cos2 θ

.

M 2

,

.

(VI.5)

(VI.6)

(VI.7)

The Kerr metric above is given in Boyer-Lindquist form.

We note again that we have induced and not derived the correct generalization of L.T.

metric into (VI.4), which is valid for any value of the rotation parameter.

VII. Simple ”derivation” of Kerr-Newman metric

We recall the derivation of Lense-Thirring metric as above: the most general black hole is

characterized by the ”exact” rotating metric with mass M, electric charge Q and rotational

parameter ”a” and is given by Kerr-Newman’s metric, where in quasi-Cartesian form, is

given by (Newman et al., 1965):

ds2 = dt2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2 −

r2 ≡ x2 + y2 + z2

where,

∆ ≡ r2 − 2mr + a2

,

ρ2 ≡ r2 + a2 cos2 θ

.

The limiting cases of Kerr metric are:

(VII.2)

(VII.3)

(VII.4)

(VII.6)

(VII.7)

A) Schwarzschild’s metric:

we recover this metric in the limit a → 0 .

B) Minkowski’s metric:

we recover when m → 0 and

a → 0 .

C) Minkowski’s rotating Universe:

when m → 0 but

a 6= 0 .

D) Lense-Thirring metric:

when a2 << 1 .

In order to check the limiting case of a Minkowski’s rotating metric, we may proceed

afresh like it follows. We write:

ds2 = dt2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2

.

In cylindrical coordinates, the above metric would become:

d˜s2 = dt2 − hd˜r2 + ˜r2d ˜φ2 + d˜z2

i

.

r = ˜r

z = ˜z

,

,

10

We revert to a rotating metric by means of the transformation of coordinates below:

,

t = ˜t

and,

dφ = d ˜φ + ω .d ˜t

.

We ﬁnd now:

ds2 = − [dr2 + r2dφ2 + dz2] + 2r2ω dφ dt + [c2 − ω2r2] dt2

.

The existence of a crossed term gφt 6= 0 , is characteristic feature of this model, likewise

the Kerr metric (see Lense-Thirring metric in Section IV).

We now extend Kerr metric into K.N. metric by the addition of a term such

that:

a) when Q = 0 ,

we obtain Kerr metric;

b) if Q 6= 0 but a = 0 ,

we obtain Reissner-Nordstr¨om’s metric .

By the same token under which we showed how to obtain Reissner-Nordstr¨om’s metric,

from Schwarzschild’s, we redeﬁne here the ∆ , writing:

To preserve clarity, we remember that in the earlier case, we recovered R.N. metric from

Schwarzschild’s, by means of the transformation:

(VII.9)

∆ ≡ r2 − 2mr + a2 + GQ2

.

VIII. Conclusion

We have shown how to derive in a simple way, with a modest mathematical apparatus,

all known basic black hole metrics. The contents of this paper will be a subject in the book

by Berman (2007, to be published).

Imitation of 2d quantum ﬁeld theory by means of REM like
models.

Abstract

An imitation of 2d ﬁeld theory is formulated by means of a model
on the hierarchic tree (with branching number close to one) with the
same potential and the free correlators identical to those of 2d ones.
Such a model possesses some features of original models for certain
scale invariant theories. For the case of 2d conformal models it is
possible to derive exact results. The renormalization group equation
for the free energy is a reaction-diﬀusion equation, which is noise-
free KPZ equation with an additional linear term. For the case of
Liouville model and strings these models on trees may be naturally
expressed via the Random Energy Model. This correspondence is used
to identify the phase structure of strings for analytical continuation of
DDK expressions. A phase transition is found for spherical strings a
bit below three dimensions.

to 1.

One of the most fruitful ideas in physics is the idea of universality. In fact,
that the only hope due to which rather artiﬁcial models of the present the-
oretical physics can successfully capture the relevant aspects of the nature.
We believe, that at the critical point the statistical mechanical system omits
the secondary details. Usually this concerns the Hamiltonian in the d dimen-
sional Euclidean space.

It is proposed while keeping the Hamiltonian ﬁxed to simplify the space
geometry as much as possible retaining two point correlators and three point
(for isosceles triangles) correlators. If the action of initial theory consists of
the Laplacian and a potential, our model feels the space dimension through

where L and a are infrared and ultraviolet cutoﬀs, r(x, x′) is the distance.
The Euclidean geometry has too many constructions. One can rotate a point
around some center and circumscribe a close circle. Let us now consider some
metric space with properties:
A.For every pair of points there is a distance r(x,x’).
B.There is some measure at every point dµs(x) with the total measure

(2)

dµs = Rd.

C.One can construct a quadratic form with corresponding asymptotic (1) for

the Green function.
We start out to construct statistical mechanical models on the simplest space,
that supports points A-C. We hope, that due to the universality these models
will acquire some properties of models in d-dimensional space. To realize this
program we will use some ideas from the theory of Random Energy Model
[5] a relation of 2d quantum Liouville model to REM
(REM) [1-5]. In ref.
and to the Directed Polymer (DP) on Cayley tree was established.
Our present analysis shows, that the connection with REM is not a peculiar
property of Liouville model and works well also for other conformal mod-
els. Besides, using similar ideas we intend to construct general 2d quantum
models in the ultrametric space and thereby generalize the above-mentioned
connection between the quantum ﬁeld theoretical models and those deﬁned
on the hierarchical lattices. First, an ultrametric space (surface) with ﬁelds,
located on the surface will be constructed. We deﬁne the following three ge-
ometrical objects: the distance between surface points, the surface measure
and the volume measure for the ball, delimited by surface. These construc-
tions are enough to deﬁne free ﬁeld action with correlators that are identical
to those in the corresponding two-dimensional space. One can add also the
interaction term to the action. The practical merit of the proposed approach
is that under certain conditions (for example, Coulomb gas approach to con-
formal theories) the theories on the ultrametric space can be solved much
easier, as compared to the Euclidean 2d space.

Let us deﬁne the ultrametric (UM) space with some measure for the (spher-
ical) area dµs(V, X), volume (ball) measure dµv(V, X), total surface eV and
total volume eV
1. It is commonly known from the mean ﬁeld theory that
the surface is of the same order of magnitude as the volume. We can con-
struct this UM space as a limit of hierarchic lattices. Consider a tree with a
constant number of branching q in each node and number N for hierarchies.
The number of end points is qN , the number of branches - (qN
1).
We consider a set of end points as a surface of sphere, the set of branches
making a volume (of the ball). Each point on the surface is connected with
the origin (zero level of the hierarchy) via a single path, which consists of
links. We determine a measure dµs(V, X) = 1 for each end point, then
dµl(V, l) = (q
1) for each link. This is mathematically correct in the limit
N
V0. Now
dµs(V0, X) = eV0 and for the total volume
we have for the total area µs =
dµl(V0, l) = eV0
l dµl, where the sum is over the links
µv =
originated from the point X. Later we will manipulate only with dµl. We
P
choose q
1 to have an equation µl + 1 = µs. We determine UM distance
n
between two points x, y on this surface V0 −
N , where n is the
number of the hierarchic level, on which x and y had the last common node
on trajectories to their point from the origin. The maximum UM distance
between two points v on the surface is V0 (an ordinary distance as a function
of V will be deﬁned lately). Now a scalar ﬁeld φ(x) is deﬁned on our surface.
For determination of kinetic energy, which should be a quadratic form with
the Laplacian as the kernel in the conventional space, let us consider the
expansion

to construct a quantum ﬁeld theory in this case. Our constructions for the

volume measure inside the sphere V is eV

We are going to discretize (5), then derive the iteration equations for
imitations of 2d and 3d cases. For the case of spin models on hierarchic
trees it is well known that it is possible to write simple iteration equations
(similar to those in Ref.[6]) for any value of q. For the case (5) we formulated
iteration equations in Section 2 for 2-d imitation and in Section 3 for 3-d case.
The resulting equation are similar to the KPZ equation [7],but there is an
additional linear term. Instead of our abstract approach (q = 1 trees) it is
possible to consider a branching diﬀusion process like [4] and formulate 2-d
models imitation on its basis. This approach is constructed in Section 4.

It is possible to derive the majority of results of 2-d conformal theory by
means of Coulomb gas representation [8]. Here the free ﬁeld action is modiﬁed
by an imaginary linear term in the action. Correlators of ﬂuctuating ﬁeld
in a critical theories with interaction are equivalent to correlators (from the
exponential of a such free ﬁeld) in modiﬁed free ﬁeld picture. In Section 5
we derived the three point correlators in our approach and the results agree
with those in the 2-d case [8].

4

For the case of exponential function for U(x) potential (2d Liouville model
in the Euclidean space) there is a strict result [9]-[10] that the thermodynam-
ics of our model on hierarchic tree is independent of q and is similar to REM.
In Section 6 a qualitative derivation for a REM with complex replica numbers
(using the results of [11] for real number of replicas)is given and the solu-
tion of REM at complex temperatures [12]-[13] is obtained then those results
are used to identify phase structure of strings, using analytical continuation
of DDK formulas [14]-[16].
In Section 6 the main results of the work are
discussed.

2 Iteration equations for the 2-d case.

The advantage of representation (5) is that we are in a position to calculate
the partition function through iterations. This is well known for models on
hierarchical lattices [6]. Let us for some large number K, divide V into K
parts V /K and determine a hierarchical tree with K levels and branching

Only in this case the analytical solution proves possible. The point is, that
for the bulk structure of theory the value of q is irrelevant. For

In analogy to Eqs.
To calculate the correlator < exp(iαφ(x)
iαφ(y)) > , where the hierarchic
distance between points x, y is v0, one should distinguish during the iteration
between the links located on the paths that connect the origin with the points
x,y. Thus we also consider the equation

f0(v0, x) = f (v0, x, α)f (v0, x,

It is important to investigate the version of Generalized Random Energy
Model (GREM) corresponding to (27) , when our model is deﬁned on hier-
archic lattice with large branching number q. Here the physics at d = 2 and
d > 2 is quite diﬀerent and one cannot use the methods of [9] for the latter
case.

4 Branching diﬀusion

Instead of the structure of q = 1 trees it is possible to consider an ensemble of
hierarchic trees having again a small branching number after the averaging.
An analogous process has been introduced in [4], and here we give only a little
modiﬁcation to choose proper boundary conditions for a desired potential.
There is an origin and a branch from it. Branch appears from the original
branchs during the period of time dt with the length dt. Alternatively, with
the probability 1-dt the old branch is elongated by the length dt and a random
variable fl is introduced with the variance

< f 2

l >= dt/2

(28)

After some period of time t the number of endpoints is exp(t). Every branch
has one or more random variables. The ﬁelds at the endpoints of tree are
again deﬁned as a sum of random variables along the trajectory. The variable
w(t, x) is deﬁned as

w(t, x) =< exp(

U(y + x)) >

(29)

y
X

Here the summation y is along all endpoints of a tree after period of time
t. Let us deﬁne w(t + dt, x). One should keep in view at the determination
of w(t + dt, x) that during dt time either there appears a new branch (the
contribution of this process is equal to dtw(t, x)2), or , if stays the old branch
dt)w(t, x + fl). Combining

The derivation of this equation has been done in [9] where the case w(0, x) =

exp(
that the nonlinear term is replaced by w2
w. We believe that critical prop-
erties of both the approaches (13),(30) are the same. The point is that for
q = 1 tree approach there is no any averaging in an ensemble and thus it is
easier to deal with the perturbative expansion. Of course our equation (13)
is also a reaction diﬀusion-equation.
Another interesting problem is an imitation of d-d reaction diﬀusion equa-
tions on q = 1 space.

We can apply these ideas to conformal theories using the Coulomb-gas for-

6.2 Solution of REM at complex replica numbers

Let us consider Eq. (51) for positive integer values of µ, where the averaging
is made over the distribution (52) for each Ei.
There are only two competing terms in the sum and two corresponding
phases. The ﬁrst one is paramagnetic (PM) phase , originated from the
cross terms in zµ expansion

The second one, the correlated paramagnetic (CPM)[11] is originated from
the diagonal terms in (53) like e−

Let us consider the continuation of (54) at µ < 1. At critical βc its entropy
ln Z
dβ disappears. Let as assume for ln Z in this region an expression
proportional to β (it is natural for a system with zero entropy) and µ. The
continuity of ln Z gives for the spin-glass (SG) phase

If we pass to complex temperatures [14]-[15], then (51) transforms to (it is

In Eq. (55) one has to replace β by β1,then

For complex temperatures there is the fourth, Lee-Young-Fisher (LYF) phase
[12]. Its derivation is not direct. The point is that for noninteger values of µ

The imaginary parts of ln Z in (61)-(63) were ignored.
To ﬁnd the borders between four phases ﬁrst has to obtain the correct phase
at µ
with the corresponding
one for CPM phase. It is known that LYF phase exists at

0 limit, then compare its expression for

otherwise at LYF phase. What can we say about string physics base on the
REM picture?
The most interesting case is the spherical one. When the value of cis in-
creased to pass over the c = 1 barrier, nothing happens in REM picture, the
system is still in CPM phase, as for in the c < 1 case. The PM or CPM
phases are ordinary physical phases, so one could try to succeed here with

the same level of reliability, as for c < 1 strings outside of the minimal se-
ries. To reveal interesting (unitary) theories explicitly one should solve the
directed polymer at ﬁnite replica number including ﬁnite size corrections and
correlators.
For the high topologies we have omitted modular space dependence of par-
tition. It will be interesting to check our conclusion about diﬀerent physical
phases for diﬀerent topologies numerically. But at least for spherical case the
REM analysis seems quite reliable.

7 Conclusions

We generalized the results of [5], obtained for the 2d model with an exponen-
tial potential, for the case of other critical models, that may be formulated by
means of Laplasian (as a single diﬀerential operator)and a desired potential
of any dimensions d
2. The models can be formulated on hierarchic trees
with constant branching number q. Main observation of this work is that
for the special case of q
1 it is possible to construct a ﬁeld theory that is
similar to renormalized ﬁeld theories in continuous spaces.

We hope, that the bulk structure, the two and three point correlators
(for isosceles triangles) are the same, as those in d-d critical models. This
hypothesis is correct for the case of Liouville 2d model , as well as for the
(free) case of Coulomb gas representation [8].

We have also analyzed the phase structure of strings by consideration
of an analytical continuation of DDK formulas by analogy with REM and
solution of complex replica REM at complex temperatures.

It is possible to check our hypothesis about the equivalence of our models
on q = 1 trees with some segment of d-d ﬁeld theory by means of direct
numerical calculation of Eq. (14),(27), for example for, the ﬁeld version of
3d Ising model with proper choice of potential U.

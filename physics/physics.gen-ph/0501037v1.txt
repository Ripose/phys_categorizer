Abstract

−

We call as by our particle formation scheme an oscillatory charge
e (or
e) together with the electromagnetic waves generated by
it, of angular frequency ω, as a whole a basic particle. As a direct
Newtonian-Maxwellian solution, we obtain straightforwardly for
the particle’s component wavetrains, traveling at the velocity of
= mc2 and alternatively an
light c, a translational kinetic energy
amounts but to the par-
oscillatory mechanical energy
ticle’s total energy and m its inertial mass; 2π¯h∗
is expressed by
wave-medium parameters and identiﬁable as the Planck constant.
The solutions further yield a set of semi-empirical equations for
the particle’s de Broglie wave parameters. As to its origin, mc2
represents an energy required for the particle to counterbalance a
vacuum frictional force against the particle’s total motion.

Introduction

Inertial mass (m) is a notion originally introduced into being through I.
Newton’s three laws of motion (1687) and is one most profound property of
all matters. The inertial mass was in 1905 postulated by A. Einstein on phe-
nomenological ground to have a relationship with the particle’s total energy
= mc2; the relation has since been broadly demonstrated by experi-
(
∈
ments. Nevertheless, the origin and nature of inertial mass remain up to the

present as one of the longest-standing unsolved mysteries of physics. This
problem has in the past been the subject of persistent studies involving many
prominent physicists.

We have recently achieved a particle formation scheme1–5, by which a basic
material particle like an electron, proton, and positron, etc. brieﬂy, is formed
by an oscillatory massless elementary charge with either sign, together with
the electromagnetic waves generated by it in the vacuum. And the vacuum
is ﬁlled of entities called vacuuons, each consisting of a positive and negative
107 J, and will be induced
elementary charge bound with a binding energy
with a shear elasticity by an applied ﬁeld. The scheme has demonstrated the
viability of yielding the overall observed particle properties.

∼

For our present concern, this scheme has with it a built-in mechanism
for the acquisition of particle mass, as the direct results of the Newtonian-
Maxwellian solutions for the particle, out of a mass-energy relation, and for
yielding the equations, in semiempirical terms only for the introduction here,
for Planck constant and de Broglie wave parameters. In the present paper we
expose in a self-contained manner these solutions, as an except content from
the complete work Ref. 1 (early edition Ref. 4). In the end we comment on
the origin of mass, and also the perspective of this in connection with the
contemporary proposal of the Higgs mechanism.

Equation of motion. Solutions

Consider in the vacuum a charge q generally in sinusoidal oscillation, assum-
ing ﬁrstly being localized at R(X, Y, Z) = 0, of displacement uq = Aq sin(ΩqT )
and angular frequency Ωq, oriented in a given time say in Z-direction. The
charge generates owing to the oscillation electromagnetic waves, consisting
in Maxwellian ﬁeld representation of radiation electric and magnetic ﬁelds,
E(R, T ) and B(R, T ), propagated in radial R-direction in a three-dimensional
space; the wave intensity is a donut ring about the Z-axis and strongest in
X
Y plane. Alternatively we can represent only formally here the peri-
odic processes with a corresponding (say to the electric ﬁeld) mechanical dis-
placement, u(R, T ). In either of the representations, we can rather generally
describe the periodic process with a dimensionless displacement, ϕ(R, T ).

−

Consider a wave path in a radial R(R, θ, φ)-direction making an angle θ
at the Z-axis and an azimuthal angle φ at the X-axis. The waves propagated
Ω = sin θdθdφ about R have a constant
along a cone chain of a solid angle d
energy, and, in terms of ϕj(R, T ) here, are known to obey the classical wave

Ω = Kc,

and Λ = 2π/K = c2π/Ω for the wavelength. The electromagnetic wave mani-
fests as a passive response of the medium to the source perturbation and thus
adopts the frequency of the latter through a conversion relation Ω = ΩqKb
as can be readily worked out by the reader or see Ref. 1, and is accordingly
monochromatic.

Besides ϕj and the wave parameters, a complete speciﬁcation of a station-
ary wave, in respect to such as its total energy, necessarily requires also the
information of its spatial extension at any given time. Suppose the charge
at the given orientation generates continuously wave disturbances for a time
∆T ; ∆T has to do with the total oscillatory energy of the charge and needs
only be regarded here formally (see detailed representation in Ref. 1). The
stationary sequence of wave disturbances (as generated to both R and
R
directions) stretches then along the wave path a wavetrain of total length
Lϕ = 1
ϕ. Suppose the waves in
R-direction is bound within reﬂection walls separated L apart, the total wave-
train thus winds Nbϕ (> 1 or >> 1) loops about L at any time.

We now compute the wave energy in mechanical terms. We can think that
the cone chain of the vacuum about R consists of coupled oscillators of mass
dMϕ(R) = ρ0bR2d
Ω, separation distance b, and in transverse direction a cross
sectional area R2d
Ω, ρ0 being the volume mass density of the vacuum. Suppose
e
the mechanical displacement of the chain is u(R, T ) and is related to ϕ(R, T )
as u = Dϕ; D is a conversion factor of length unit and DCK = A gives the
corresponding displacement amplitude; A = Aq/2π as detailed treatment will
show1. The total wave energy, containing a potential and kinetic term for each
oscillator, multiplied then by the number of Nbϕ = Lϕ/b oscillators for the
total wavetrain of length Lϕ (sum of the lengths of all of two wavetrains), is
given by the standard result:

The total wavetrain, traveling at the velocity of light c which is ﬁnite as
opposed to inﬁnite, and having a translational energy E and linear momentum
P as given above, is inevitably an inertial system. The total wavetrain must
thereby have a corresponding inertial mass, M. M is related by Newton’s

IV Particle. Particle total dynamics.

Conforming to our particle formation scheme of Refs. 1- 3, we shall hereafter
call the (oscillatory) charge together with the wavetrains generated by it as
a whole a particle. The wavetrains are thus the internal components and
their motions the internal processes of a given particle. The foregoing E,
P, and M of a particle’s total wavetrain represent accordingly the total rest
energy, total rest momentum, and rest mass of a given particle. Notice that
the oscillatory energy of the charge and the wave energy of the medium are two
alternative representations of the same quantity and only one of these should
to be counted.

We shall now express the corresponding total quantities for a particle in
motion, say at the velocity v in X-direction; its component wave variables are
the Doppler displaced ones given in Sec. III. The wave processes with their
phases uncorrelated are statistical events. It is thus pertinent to express the
total energy, momentum and inertial mass and angular frequency in question
here with the geometric means of the respective conjugate Doppler quantities:

ing particle are dependant on the particle velocity only in second order, i.e.
(v/c)2. So at the classic-velocity limit the particle motion makes no contri-
∝
bution to the total quantities which thereby identify with the respective total
rest quantities.

VI Discussion

(a) The origin of mass: We have shown in the above that the total energy
of a particle amounts to the kinetic energy of the particle’s total motion.
∈
This energy can be apprehended as required for the particle to counterbalance
a certain frictional force opposed to the particle’s total motion. That such a
frictional force is indeed exerted by the vacuum, whence the vacuum frictional
force, will follow immediately once the vacuum is given a physical representa-
tion as a substantial medium and the wave as its mechanical process (this has
been systematically done in Ref. 1). The physics of the vacuum frictional force
(see further Ref. 1) will have no principle diﬀerence from that against a charge
motion in an material medium, which physics has been well established.

The frictional force of the vacuum which is known to us to ﬁll everywhere
in space, must be universally exerted on any objects moving (in terms of total
motion) in it. In Isaac Newton’s laws of motion this vacuum frictional force is
alternatively but equivalently assigned as an intrinsic property of the object,
the inertial mass, or the inertial force when expressed in force unit.

8

(b) The physics of mass-energy relation: The foregoing solution exposes
= mc2, takes the
that it is not an accident that the mass-energy equation,
particular form of the kinetic energy, as expected from Newtonian mechanics,
of a mass m traveling at the velocity of light c. We have seen that this is the
physical consequence that the mass executing this motion is nothing else but
an electromagnetic wave(train), and c is its wave velocity.

∈

(c) The origin of mass presented here is in conformity with the contem-
porary Higgs mechanism6 (see e.g. one of recent reviews in Ref. 7), in the
sense that mass results from some massless charge in a viscous vacuum (this
proposal), or alternatively from certain component moving in a certain ﬁeld
(Higgs mechanism). However apparently, the two proposals for the origin of
mass are associated with two distinct schemes for particle formation. The
schemes diﬀer, primarily perhaps, in that the present scheme works in real
space, whilst Higgs’ in momentum space as of the quantum ﬁeld theories.

As shown in this paper a particle simply formed by a single oscillatory
charge is an extensive wave by formation; and this formation is governed by
the established laws of classical mechanics and not by imposition. The parti-
cle’s de Broglie wave properties, and its relativistic mass and (as shown in Ref.
1) length contraction, are the natural results of Doppler eﬀect with a solid ex-
perimental grounding. Also as shown in our other resports1–3 the Newtonian-
Maxwellian description of such particle leads directly to the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, a universal gravitational interaction, and other overall observed proper-
ties of basic material particles. Such desirable features tend to have been more
readily endorsed by the real-space representation of the present scheme.

(d) Our discussion here is in respect of the center-of-mass motion of an
elementary charge with either sign, which forms accordingly the observed iso-
latable basic particles like the electron and proton. But apparently, the same
scheme for the formation of a basic particle here is viable also for the formation
of a ”particle” from any fraction of charge, like the net charge of a composite
particle, or at the ﬁner scale the (1/3)e or
(1/3)e of a quark. The only re-
quirement is that the center-of-mass motion of the given charge is considered
in respect of particle dynamics, and the total motion of all the charge involved
is considered in respect of the total energy and mass of that ”particle”.

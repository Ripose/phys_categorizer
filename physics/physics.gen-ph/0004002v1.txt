A BRIEF NOTE ON FLUCTUATIONS AND

INTERACTIONS

Abstract

In this brief note we re-emphasize the fact that an underpinning
of ﬂuctuations characterizes the fundamental interactions in the light
of El Naschie’s recent work.

In a recent paper El Naschie has introduced the concept of a ﬂuction [1],
a result of geometric ﬂuctuation which could lead towards a uniﬁcation of
fundamental forces. It is pointed out in this brief note that recent work by
the author does indeed emphasize the underpinning of ﬂuctuations for fun-
damental interactions.
In this recent work[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], it was pointed out ﬁrstly that the ﬂuctu-
ation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (or the Zero Point Field) leads to[8],

√¯hc/L2,

∆B ∼

(1)

where L is the spatial extent.
It was pointed out that if L ∼ Compton
wavelength of a typical elementary particle then from (1) we recover the
mass and energy of this particle. In other words at the Compton wavelength
the elementary particle ”condenses” out of the background Zero Point Field.
Similarly a ﬂuctuation in the metric leads to (Cf.refs.[1, 2]),

∆Γ ∼

L ∼ lP /L2

where lP ∼ 10−33cms ∼ Planck scale. Unlike in equation (1), if L in (2) is
taken to be ∼ lP then from (2) we get the gravitational interaction.
That ﬂuctuations tie up equations (1) and (2) can be seen explicitly as fol-
lows. As is known, given N ∼ 1080 elementary particles in the universe, the
√N which leads to a ﬂuctuational
ﬂuctuation in the particle number is ∼
electromagnetic energy which in the above scheme is the energy of the typical
elementary particle, so that we have (Cf. also[9])

e2√N

R

= mc2

Using in (3) the fact that[3, 10],

R =

GNm

c2

we get the well known relation

∼ Gm2

√N = Gm2

Equation (4) is usually interpreted as an adhoc or empirical relation compar-
ing the strengths of gravitational and electromagnetic forces. But once the
ﬂuctuational underpinning has been taken into account, we have deduced (4)
and can now see the connection between electromagnetic and gravitational
interactions. Indeed from (4) one can deduce that[11] at the Planck scale the
electromagnetic and gravitational forces become equal, or alternatively the
Planck scale of mass ∼ 10−5gms is a Schwarszchild black hole.
Indeed in the model referred to earlier, elementary particles like electrons
are Kerr-Newman type black holes giving at once both the electromagnetic
and gravitational ﬁelds including the Quantum Mechanical anomalous gyro
magnetic ratio g = 2[12].
From this point, it was shown that the strong interactions follow at the Comp-
ton wavelength scale itself, where the dimensionality is low (Cf.ref.[6, 4, 5]).
Infact within the same scheme, it was shown that the very puzzling character-
istics of quarks namely their fractional charge, handedness and conﬁnement
besides the order of their massses can be deduced.
It is by the same argument of the ﬂuctuation of the number of particles that
it was shown that the weak interactions can also be explained[7, 13].
In-
deed similar arguments in a diﬀerent context were put forward years ago by

Hayakawa[14].
Brieﬂy if the weak force is mediated by a particle of mass M and Compton
wavlength L we get from the ﬂuctuation of particle number, this time

g2√N L2

∼ 10−14,
whence the weak interaction can be characterised.
The conclusion is that the spirit of El Naschie’s ﬂuction is vindicated (Cf.also
ref.[15]).

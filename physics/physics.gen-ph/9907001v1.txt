Aiming at providing an objective motion picture for the microscopic object described by the wave
function, new analysis about motion is presented by use of the point set theory in mathematics,
through which we show that a new kind of motion named quantum discontinuous motion is the
general motion mode of the particle, while classical continuous motion is just one kind of extremely
peculiar motion, and the wave function in quantum mechanics proves to be the very mathemati-
cal complex describing the particle undergoing the quantum discontinuous motion. Furthermore,
Schr¨odinger equation of the wave function is shown to be the simplest nonrelativistic evolution
equation for the particle undergoing the new motion, and the consistent axiom system of quantum
mechanics is also deduced out. At last, we demonstrate that present quantum measurement theories
just conﬁrm the existence of the new motion of the microscopic particle described by the wave func-
tion, and the weird displays of the wave function in microscopic world are also physically explained
in terms of the new motion.

I. INTRODUCTION

Owing to the springing up of the new concepts about the wave function such as quantum cosmology and protective
measurement [6] [11] [12], the demand for the last objective interpretation of the wave function is skyrocketing in
recent years. On the other hand, the analyses about motion have never ceased since the old Greece times, but from
Zeno Paradox to Einstein’s relativity [1], only classical continuous motion is discussed. In fact, there exist some other
motion modes in nature, and the mysterious quantum motion in microscopic world may be one of these snubbed
motion modes. In this paper we present one kind of new motion, which is called quantum discontinuous motion, and
after a deep and reasonable analysis we ﬁnd that the last reality underlying the wave function is just the new motion
undergone by the microscopic particle.

From a historical point of view, interpreting the wave function in terms of new motion of particle inherits the
essence of thought accumulated since the foundation of quantum mechanics, the ﬁrst essential concept is the ontology
concept widely adopted in interpreting quantum mechanics, it aims at ﬁnding the last reality behind the mysterious
wave function, this concept can be traced back to Einstein, Schr¨odinger, and the followers Bohm [5], Bell [10] et al,
especially in recent years, the protective measurement [11] [12] presented by Aharonov et al has not only consolidated
this concept from the inside of quantum mechanics, but also provided the experiments to conﬁrm it, thus this advance
cries for an objective elucidation about the reality underlying the wave function more strongly than ever, and it may
be the time to disclose the whole quantum mystery now.

The second is the particle concept hold by Born’s generally-accepted probability interpretation [3] and nearly most
following interpretations of quantum mechanics, according to this particle concept the last reality described by the
wave function in quantum mechanics is essentially a particle, which is in only one position in space at any instant.
The most predominant character of this concept is that it can not only describe the particle picture in nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics, but also be extended to describe the ﬁeld picture in relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory when
uniting new motion with special relativity; on the other hand, it provides a precondition to further study the boring
collapse process as one kind of objective process.

The third is the renunciation of classical continuous motion, for example, it is widely demonstrated and accepted
by ontologists that the microscopic particle can not pass through only one slit without inﬂuenced by another slit in
two-slit experiment, and sometimes they even say that the microscopic particle ”passes through both slits” or ”in
two positions at the same time” [11] [12], although this kind of description is too vague to form a strict deﬁnition
or elucidation about the objective quantum motion undergone by the microscopic particle, which may be extremely

1

diﬀerent from classical continuous motion, needless to say, the renunciation of classical continuous motion sheds light
on the road to interpret the wave function in terms of new motion other than classical continuous motion, and the
vague description ”in two positions at the same time” indeed grasps something real and moves a peg along this road.
Certainly, there exist other deeper logical reasons leading to interpreting the wave function in terms of new motion

of particle, some of them are as follows:

(1). The linear superposition principle of wave function in quantum mechanics strongly implies that the real object
described by the wave function, if any, is not a ﬁeld, but a particle, since as to the ﬁeld its diﬀerent branches will
generally interact, and the linear superposition principle of the wave function describing the ﬁeld will be broken; while
as to the particle, it is in only one position in space at any instant, and in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics the
transfer of interaction is instantaneous, thus for the wave function describing the quantum discontinuous motion of
particle, its diﬀerent branches will not interact.

(2). Since the founding of science people have been studying the classical continuous motion of particle, and taking
it for granted that it is the only type of motion in Nature, but from the mathematical analyses it is shown that
there exists one kind of complementary motion mode of classical continuous motion, which can be called quantum
discontinuous motion, they form the complete set of motion modes of particle, and the former seems more natural
than the latter. In physics, as we will demonstrate, the macroscopic world is governed by the classical continuous
motion, while the microscopic world is governed by the quantum discontinuous motion.

(3). In order to unify particle and ﬁeld, we have been searching for the lost connection between them, now the new
motion—quantum discontinuous motion is just the lost golden bridge. On the one hand, the object undergoing the
new motion is a particle, this is the particle-like aspect of the new motion, owing to this particle-like property, the
new motion of particle provides a essential basis to account for the objective collapse process of the wave function
during quantum measurement, since the deﬁnite measurement result such as one spot on the photoplate, is produced
only in one local region, not in many diﬀerent local regions in space; On the other hand, the particle undergoing the
new motion moves throughout the whole space with a certain position measure density ρ(x, t) during inﬁnitesimal
time interval, this is the ﬁeld-like aspect of the new motion, owing to this ﬁeld-like property, the new motion of
particle can describe the objective evolution process of the wave function during normal evolution, which determines
the interference pattern of the particle, and will provide the objective origin of probability in quantum mechanics.

(4). When the new motion marries with special relativity, we will ﬁnd that it can be extended to describe the
quantum ﬁeld picture, and quantum mechanics will naturally be taken over by quantum ﬁeld theory, concretely
speaking, when in relativistic quantum ﬁeld the transfer velocity of interaction is ﬁnite, thus for the wave function
describing the quantum discontinuous motion of particle, its diﬀerent branches will interact through the transfer
particle of the interaction, for example, in quantum electrodynamics the diﬀerent branches of the electron wave
function will interact through the photon, which is characterized by the interaction term ¯ψγµAµψ.

(5). The new motion of particle will provide a broader framework for objectively studying the microscopic process,
in which the notorious collapse problem may be naturally solved, for example, there may exist many kinds of concrete
motion modes among the new motion, and the new motion may display diﬀerently in the nonrelativistic and relativistic
domains, especially when involving relativistic gravity the new motion of particle may naturally provide the origin of
randomness in the collapse process, and further result in the objective collapse process.

(6). It is generally accepted that the main accepted objective interpretations of quantum mechanics are Everett’s
relative state interpretation [8] and Bohm’s hidden variables interpretation [5], but besides other unsatisfactory char-
acters they all interpret neither the wave function, nor Schr¨odinger equation of the wave function, as to the former,
the wave function is directly taken as a physical entity with no a priori interpretation, while as to the latter, the
wave function is taken as a real ﬁeld in the conﬁguration space, which is assumed to satisfy Schr¨odinger equation
in quantum mechanics with no further interpretation, in fact, it does not interpret this objective ﬁeld in real space
either. Now, in this paper we will interpret both the wave function and its Schr¨odinger equation in terms of the new
motion of particle.

The plan of this paper is as follows: In Sect. 2 we ﬁrst give three general presuppositions, which relate physical
reality with abstract mathematics, and are the basis of the following analysis about motion. In Sect. 3 we give a
strict mathematical analysis about motion by use of point set theory, especially the discontinuous motion described
by regular dense point set is analyzed in detail. In Sect. 4 a strict physical deﬁnition of the new motion—quantum
discontinuous motion is given, the wave function in quantum mechanics is interpreted as a mathematical complex
describing the particle undergoing the quantum discontinuous motion, and the consistent axiom system of quantum
mechanics is deduced out, especially Schr¨odinger equation of the wave function is shown to be the simplest nonrel-
ativistic evolution equations for the particle undergoing the quantum discontinuous motion. Furthermore, in Sect.
5 we demonstrate that the quantum measurement theories just conﬁrm the existence of the quantum discontinuous
motion of the microscopic particle described by the wave function. At last, in Sect. 6 the notorious characters of wave
function is consistently interpreted, and two concrete examples are given to explain the weird displays of the wave
function in microscopic world in terms of the quantum discontinuous motion of particle.

II. THREE GENERAL PRESUPPOSITIONS

First, we will give three general presuppositions about the relation between physical reality and abstract mathe-
matics, which are basic conceptions and correspondence rules before we discuss the physical motion of particle, we
suppose they are the commonness for all kinds of physical motion of particle.

(1). Time and space in which the particle moves are both continuous point set.
(2). The moving particle is represented by one point in time and space.
(3). The motion of particle is represented by the point set in time and space.
For simplicity but lose no generality, in the following we will mainly analyze one-dimension motion, namely the

point set in two-dimension time and space.

III. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS ABOUT NEW MOTION

A. Point set and its law

As we know, the point set theory has been deeply studied since the beginning of this century, nowadays we can
grasp it more easily. According to this theory, we know that the general point set is dense point set, whose basic
property is the measure of the point set, while the continuous point set is one kind of particular dense point set, its
basic property is the length of the point set.

Naturally, as to the point set in two-dimension time and space, the general situation is the dense point set in this
two-dimension space, while the continuous curve is one kind of extremely particular dense point set, surely it is a
wonder that so many points bind together to form one continuous curve by order, in fact, the probability for its
formation is zero.

Now, we will generally analyze the law of the point set, as we know, the law about the points in point set, which
can be called point law, is the most familiar law, and it is widely taken as the only rational law, for example, as to
the continuous curve in two-dimension time and space there may exist a certain expressible analytical formula for
the points in this particular point set( people cherish this kind of point laws owing to their infrequent existence, but
perhaps Nature detests and rejects them, since the probability of creating them is zero), but as to the dense point set
in two-dimension time and space the point law does not exist, since the dense point set is discontinuous everywhere,
even if the diﬀerence of time is very small, or inﬁnitesimal, the diﬀerence of space can be very large, then inﬁnitesimal
error in time will result in ﬁnite error in space, thus even if it exists we can not formulate it in nature, and owing to
ﬁnite error in time measurement, we can not conﬁrm it either, let alone predict the evolution of the point set using
it, in one word, there does not exist point law for dense point set in mathematics and physics.

Because of nonexistence of the point law for general dense point set, people cherish only the particular dense
point set—continuous curve with point law, which corresponds to classical continuous motion, and detest the general
dense point set without point law, let alone regard it as another kind of real motion mode. But when we consider
the conﬁrmation of law, we will ﬁnd more truth about the law for point set, as we know, as to the point law of
continuous curve, we must conﬁrm it by means of the following process:∆t → dt → 0, among these processes the
process ∆t → dt is complete for conﬁrming the diﬀerential law for point set, and the process dt → 0 is only necessary
for the conﬁrmation of point law, but evidently this process can not be achieved in reality, in fact, only the process
∆t → dt can possess real physical meaning through testing the law more and more accurately, thus there does not
exist point law for both general dense point set and continuous curve, and the privilege of continuous curve and the
corresponding classical continuous motion is also lost.

On the other hand, in physical there exist only the dynamical quantities deﬁned during inﬁnitesimal time interval,
this fact can be seen from the familiar diﬀerential quantities such as dt and dx, whereas the point quantities come only
from mathematics, people always mix up these two kinds of quantities, this is a huge obstacle for the development of
physics. Thus we can only discuss the quantities deﬁned during inﬁnitesimal time interval, as well as their diﬀerential
laws if we study the point set corresponding to real physical motion.

B. Deep analysis about dense point set

Now, we will further study the diﬀerential description of point set in detail.
First, in order to ﬁnd the diﬀerential description of the peculiar dense point set—continuous curve, we may measure
the rise or fall size of the space ∆x corresponding to any ﬁnite time interval ∆t near each instant tj, then at any
instant tj we can get the approximate information about the continuous curve through the quantities ∆t and ∆x at

3

that instant, and when the time interval ∆t turns smaller, we will get more accurate information about the curve.
Theoretically we can get the complete information through this inﬁnite process, that is to say, in theory we can
build up the basic description quantities for the peculiar dense point set—continuous curve, which are the diﬀerential
quantities dt and dx, then given the initial condition the relation between dt and dx at all instants will completely
describe the continuous curve.

Then, we will deeply analyze the diﬀerential description of the general dense point set. As to this kind of point set,
we still need to study the concrete situation of the point set corresponding to ﬁnite time interval near every instant.
Now, when time is during the interval ∆t near instant tj, the points in space are no longer limited in the local space
interval ∆x, they distribute throughout the whole space instead, so we should study this new nonlocal point set,
which is also dense point set, for simplicity but lose no generality, we consider ﬁnite space such as x∈[0,1], ﬁrst, we
may divide the whole space in small equal interval ∆x, then calculate the measure of the local dense point set in the
space interval ∆x near each xi, which can be written as M∆x,∆t(xi,tj), since the measure sum of all local dense point
sets in time interval ∆t just equals to the length of the continuous time interval ∆t, we have:

M∆x,∆t(xi,tj)= ∆t

Xi

On the other hand, since the measure of the local dense point set in the space interval ∆x and time interval
∆t will also turn to be zero when the intervals ∆x and ∆t turn to be zero, it is not an useful quantity, and we
have to create a new quantity on the basis of this measure. Through further analysis, we ﬁnd that a new quantity
ρ∆x,∆t(xi, tj) = M∆x,∆t(xi, tj)/(∆x · ∆t), which can be called average measure density, will be an useful one, it
generally does not turn to be zero when ∆x and ∆t turn to be zero, especially if the limit lim∆x
0ρ∆x,∆t(xi, tj)
exists, it will no longer relate to the observation sizes ∆x and ∆t, so it can accurately describe the whole dense point
set, as well as all local dense point sets near every instant, now we let:

0,∆t

→

→

then we can get:

ρ(x, t) = lim∆x

0ρ∆x,∆t(x, t)

0,∆t

→

→

ρ(x, t)dx = 1

ZΩ

this is just the normalization formula, where ρ(x,t) is called position measure density, Ω denotes the whole integral
space, we call this kind of dense point set regular dense point set.

Now, we will analyze the new quantity ρ(x,t) in detail, ﬁrst, the position measure density ρ(x,t) is not a point
quantity, it is deﬁned during inﬁnitesimal interval, this fact is very important, since it means that if the measure
density ρ(x, t) exists, then it will be continuous relative to both t and x, that is to say, contrary to the position
function x(t), there does not exist the discontinuous situation for the measure density function ρ(x,t), furthermore,
this fact also results in that the continuous function ρ(x,t) is the last useful quantity for describing the regular dense
point set; Secondly, the essential meaning of the position measure density ρ(x,t) lies in that it represents the dense
degree of the points in the point set in two-dimension space and time, and the points are denser where the position
measure density ρ(x,t) is larger.

C. The evolution of regular dense point set

Now, we will further discuss the evolution law for regular dense point set.
Just like the continuous position function x(t), although the continuous position measure density function ρ(x,t)
completely describes the regular dense point set, it is one kind of static description about the point set, and it can not
be used for prediction itself, so in order to predict the evolution of the regular dense point set we must create some
kind of quantity describing its change, enlightened by the theory of ﬂuid mechanics we can deﬁne the ﬂuid density
for the position measure density ρ(x,t) as in the following:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

we call this new quantity j(x, t) position measure ﬂuid density, it is evident that this quantity just describes the
change of the measure density of the regular dense point set, thus the general evolution equations of the regular dense
point set can be written as in the following:

∂ρ(x, t)
∂t

+

∂j(x, t)
∂x

= 0

∂ρ(x, t)
∂t

+

∂j(x, t)
∂x

= 0

∂j(x, t)
∂t

+ f (ρ, j,

, ...) = 0

∂ρ
∂x

,

∂j
∂x

(5)

(6)

where f (ρ, j, ∂ρ

∂x , ∂j

∂x , ...) is a certain function containing ρ(x, t),j(x, t) and their partial derivatives relative to x.

IV. PHYSICAL ANALYSIS ABOUT NEW MOTION

In this part, we will return to the physical world and analyze the physical motion.

A. The deﬁnition of new motion

Through the presuppositions presented in the beginning of this paper, we will give a strict physical deﬁnition of
new motion in three-dimension space, the deﬁnition for other abstract spaces or many-particle situation can be easily
extended.

(1). The new motion of particle in space is described by regular dense point set in four-dimension space and time.
(2). The new motion state of a particle in space is described by the position measure density ρ(x, y, z, t) and
the position measure ﬂuid density j(x, y, z, t) of the corresponding regular dense point set, in the simplest sit-
uation they form an integrated abstract wave function ψ(x, y, z, t) = ρ1/2 · eiS(x,y,z,t)/¯h, where S(x, y, z, t) =
m

, m is the mass of the particle and ¯h is a constant quantities.

(3). The evolution of new motion corresponds to the evolution of regular dense point set, and one of its evolution
R

equations containing the wave function ψ(x, y, z, t) is Schr¨odinger equation in quantum mechanics.

We call the new motion quantum discontinuous motion, compared with classical continuous motion, the commonness
of these two kinds of motion is that the particle exists only in one position in space at one instant, their diﬀerence
lies in the behavior of the particle during inﬁnitesimal time interval [t,t+dt], for classical continuous motion, the
particle is limited in a certain local space interval [v,v+dv], while for quantum discontinuous motion, the particle
moves throughout the whole space with a certain position measure density ρ(x, y, z, t).

On the other hand, in order to analyze the physical evolution of the new motion, one point needs to be emphasized,
according to the above deﬁnition of new motion, the particle is in only one position at any instant, but this is not
a direct physical statement, but a simple metaphysical statement about the time-division existence of the reality
undergoing the new motion, which is logically deduced from the experiment fact that the wave function satisﬁes the
linear superposition principle, or there does not exist self-interaction for the wave function in quantum mechanics,
strictly speaking, the particle may be not in only one position at one instant( we can not conﬁrm it in physics either
), the only rational physical requirement is that the instants set, at any instant of which the particle is in only one
position, forms a dense point set, whose measure equals to the length of the time interval. In fact, the following
physical states of the new motion are all deﬁned during inﬁnitesimal time interval in the meaning of measure, not
iEt, especially even the position eigenstate
at one instant, for example, the momentum eigenstate ψp(x, t) = eipx
ψ(x, t) = δ(x − x0) are still deﬁned during inﬁnitesimal time interval.

B. The evolution of new motion

In the following, we will give the main clues for ﬁnding the possible evolution equations of the new motion, at the
same time, the axiom system of quantum mechanics will be deduced out by use of a logical analysis, and Schr¨odinger
equation will prove to be just the simplest nonrelativistic evolution equations of the new motion. For simplicity but
lose no generality, we mainly analyze one-dimension motion, but the results can be easily extended to three-dimension
situation.

1. Two kinds of description bases
As we know, contrary to classical continuous motion, the state of quantum discontinuous motion is generally
nonlocal, and the particle undergoing this new motion moves throughout the whole space with a certain position
measure density ρ(x, t) during inﬁnitesimal time interval, thus there exist two kinds of description bases for quantum
discontinuous motion in essence, one should be the position of particle, which is local description basis; the other will

5

be the corresponding nonlocal description basis, in the following we will demonstrate that it is just the momentum of
particle.

In fact, in order to ﬁnd the nonlocal description basis, we only need to analyze the simplest situation of the free
evolution of the new motion, where ρ(x,t) is constant during the evolution, for this situation we can easily ﬁnd that
j(x, t) is also constant, and we have:

∂ρ(x, t)
∂t

= 0

∂j(x, t)
∂x

= 0

∂j(x, t)
∂t

= 0

∂ρ(x, t)
∂x

= 0

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

but the mathematical and physical meaning of these four equations need to be analyzed, ﬁrstly, these equations can
also hold in classical ﬂuid mechanics, but as to describing the evolution of the new motion of a particle, their meaning
will be very diﬀerent, according to these four equations, the quantities position measure density ρ(x, t) and position
measure ﬂuid density j(x, t) will be constant irrelevant to both x and t, generally we can let ρ(x, t)=1, then we have
j(x, t)=ρ(x, t) · v0=v0=p0/m, where m is the mass of the particle, these two results mean that for the free particle
undergoing the new motion with one constant momentum, its position will spread throughout the whole space with
the same position measure density, thus we demonstrate that the momentum of particle is just the nonlocal description
basis, and the momentum state of new motion is completely nonlocal.

2. One-to-one relation
Now we have shown there are two kinds of description bases for quantum discontinuous motion, but it is evident that
there exists only one deﬁnite motion state at any instant, so the state description using these two kinds of description
bases should be equivalent, this means that there exists a one-to-one relation between these two descriptions, and this
relation is irrelevant to the concrete motion state, in the following we will mainly discuss how to ﬁnd this one-to-one
relation, and our analysis will also show that this relation essentially determines the distinct evolution for quantum
discontinuous motion, as well as the axiom framework of Hilbert space for quantum mechanics.

Like the measure density ρ(x, t) and measure ﬂuid density j(x, t) for local position x of the particle, we can also
deﬁne the measure density f (p, t) and measure ﬂuid density J(p, t) for the nonlocal momentum p of the particle, and
according to the above analysis there should exists a one-to-one relation between the local position description (ρ, j)
and nonlocal momentum description (f, J). First, it is evident that there exists no direct one-to-one relation between
the measure density functions ρ(x, t) and f (p, t), since even for the above simplest situation, we have ρ(x, t) = 1
and f (p, t) = δ2(p − p0)( this result can be directly obtained when considering the general normalization relation
Ω ρ(x, t)dx =
Then in order to obtain the one-to-one relation, we have to create new properties on the basis of the above position
R
description (ρ, j) and momentum description (f, J), this needs a little more mathematical trick, here we only give the
main clues and the detailed mathematical demonstrations are omitted, ﬁrst, we disregard the time variable t and let
t = 0, as to the above free evolution state with one momentum, we have (ρ, j) = (1, p0/m) and (f, J) = (δ2(p − p0), 0),
thus we need to create a new position state function ψ(x, 0) using 1 and p0/m, a new momentum state function ϕ(p, 0)
using δ2(p − p0) and 0, and ﬁnd the one-to-one relation between these two state functions, this means there exists an
one-to-one transformation between the state functions ψ(x, 0) and ϕ(p, 0), we generally write it as follows:

Ω f (p, t)dp), and there is no one-to-one relation between them.
R

ψ(x, 0) =

ϕ(p, 0)T (p, x)dp

(11)

where T (p, x) is called transformation function and generally continuous and ﬁnite for ﬁnite p and x, since the function
ϕ(p, 0) will contain some form of the basic element δ2(p−p0), normally we may expand it as ϕ(p, 0) =
∞i=1 aiδi(p−p0),
while the function ψ(x, 0) will contain the momentum p0, and be generally continuous and ﬁnite for ﬁnite x, then
it is evident that the function ϕ(p, 0) can only contain the term δ(p − p0), because the other terms will result in
inﬁniteness.

On the other hand, since the result ϕ(p, 0) = δ(p − p0) implies that there exists the relations f(p,0)=ϕ(p, 0)∗ϕ(p, 0)
and ρ(x, 0)=ψ(x, 0)∗ψ(x, 0), we may let ψ(x, 0) = eiG(p0,x) and have T (p, x) = eiG(p,x), then considering the symmetry
between the properties position and momentum( this symmetry essentially stems from the equivalence between these
two kinds of descriptions, the direct implication is for ρ(x, 0) = δ2(x − x0) we also have f (p, 0) = 1 ) we have
∞i=1 bi(px)i, but the symmetry between the properties position and momentum further
the extension G(p, x) =
1(p, x)
results in the symmetry between the transformation T (p, x) and its reverse transformation T −
1(p, x)dp, thus we can only have the term px in the function G(p, x),
ψ(x, 0)T −
satisﬁes the relation ϕ(p, 0) =
ipx, and
for this situation the symmetry relation between these two transformations is T −
we let b1 = 1/¯h, where ¯h is a constant quantity, for simplicity we let ¯h = 1 in the following discussions. Then
mainly owing to the essential symmetry involved in the new motion we work out the basic one-to-one relation, it is
ψ(x, 0) =

ϕ(p, 0)eipxdp, where ψ(x, 0) = e−

ip0x and ϕ(p, 0) = δ(p − p0).

1(p, x) = T ∗(p, x) = e−

1(p, x), where T −

In fact, there may exist other complex forms for the state functions ψ(x, 0) and ϕ(p, 0), for example, they are not the
above simple number functions but multidimensional vector functions such as ψ(x, 0) = (ψ1(x, 0), ψ2(x, 0), ..., ψn(x, 0))
and ϕ(p, 0) = (ϕ1(p, 0), ϕ2(p, 0), ..., ϕn(p, 0)), but the above one-to-one relation still exists for every component func-
n
tion, and these vector functions still satisfy the above modulo square relations, namely ρ(x, 0) =
i=1 ψi(x, 0)∗ψi(x, 0)
n
and f (p, 0) =
i=1 ϕi(p, 0)∗ϕi(p, 0), these complex forms will correspond to more complex theories, say, involving
more inner properties of the particle such as charge and spin etc.

P

Now, since the one-to-one relation between the position state description and momentum state description is
irrelevant to the concrete motion state of the new motion, the above one-to-one relation for the free motion state with
one momentum should apply for any motion state of the new motion, and the states which satisfy the one-to-one
relation will be the possible motion states of the new motion. Furthermore, it is evident that this one-to-one relation
will directly result in the famous uncertainty relation △x · △p ≥ ¯h/2, and as we will demonstrate, it will essentially
result in the consistent axiom system of quantum mechanics.

P

3. Axiom I of quantum mechanics
Now, the direct linear superposition of the above momentum state ψp(x, 0) = e−

ipx, which can be called momentum
eigenstate, will evidently satisfy the one-to-one relation, and should be the possible motion state of the new motion, at
the same time, Fourier analysis further shows that any normal motion state can be expanded as the linear superposition
of the momentum eigenstates, then all normal motion states of the new motion will form an abstract complex linear
space, which has been called Hilbert space, thus we have shown that any motion state of the system undergoing the
new motion will correspond to the state vector in Hilbert space, namely the Axiom I of quantum mechanics [7] [9],
for example, the free new motion state with two momenta corresponds to the state vector in Hilbert space, which is
a certain kind of linear superposition of two free new motion states with one momentum in this space.

4. Axiom II of quantum mechanics
From a mathematical point of view, the above one-to-one relation will also physically determine the linear operator
structure in Hilbert space, which may give a more abstract but deeper description of the new motion, thus the Axiom
II of quantum mechanics [7] [9] is further included, namely, every observable of the system corresponds to the self-
adjoint operator in the Hilbert state space, the self-adjoint requirement guarantees the real value of the corresponding
physical observable, which may be the position observable x, the momentum observable p and the energy observable
E etc, and in general the relations of these observables can be extended to the corresponding operators.

Furthermore, through deﬁning the linear operators ˆx and ˆp, the above one-to-one relation describing the new motion

will result in the famous noncommuting relation [ˆx, ˆp] = i¯h, which is taken as the basis for quantizing anything.

5. Axiom III of quantum mechanics
Now, we will demonstrate that the Axiom III of quantum mechanics [7] [9], as well as the irreducibility of probability
in quantum mechanics, results from the objective nature of the quantum discontinuous motion, ﬁrst, the proper
measurement in physics should reﬂect the property of the measured system as truly as possible, and it is also rational
to presuppose the existence of such proper measurement for the new motion, as well as for other realities; secondly,
if we assume that each measurement about the system undergoing the new motion will bring about only one deﬁnite
result, then the objective measure density ρ of the new motion will naturally result in the probability distribution of
the measurement results, which is P = |ψ|2 for discrete observable and P =
E1 |ψ|2dE for continuous observable,
where [E1, E2] is the result interval, this is just the Axiom III of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, there does not
R
exist one kind of point description for the quantum discontinuous motion in essence, so the probability for a single
deﬁnite measurement result is irreducible, it is essentially determined by the discontinuity and value-dispersion nature
of the quantum discontinuous motion.
6. Axiom IV of quantum mechanics
Now, we will work out the dynamical evolution law of the new motion, namely the Axiom IV of quantum mechanics.
First, in order to ﬁnd how the time variable t is included in the functions ψ(x, t) and ϕ(p, t), we may consider the

E2

(15)

linear superposition of two momentum eigenstates, namely ψ(x, t) = 1
ic2(t)], then the position
√2
measure density is ρ(x, t) = [1+cos(△c(t)−△px)]/2, where △c(t) = c2(t)−c1(t) and △p = p2−p1, now we let △p → 0,
then we have ρ(x, t) → 1 and △c(t) → 0, especially using the conservation relation we can get dc(t)/dt = dp · p/m,
namely dc(t) = d(p2/m) · t or dc(t) = dE · t, where E = p2/m, is the energy of the particle in the nonrelativistic
domain, thus as to any momentum eigenstate we have the time-included formula ψ(x, t) = eipx

ic1(t) + eip2x

[eip1x

iEt.

Now, as to the free motion state with one momentum, namely the momentum eigenstate ψ(x, t) = eipx

iEt, using
m and including the constant quantity ¯h we can easily ﬁnd its nonrelativistic evolution

the nonrelativistic relation E = p
law, which is

i¯h

∂ψ(x, t)
∂t

¯h2

·

∂2ψ(x, t)
∂x2

then owing to the linearity of this equation, this evolution equation also applies to the linear superposition of the
momentum eigenstates, namely all possible free notion states, or we can say, it is the free evolution law for the new
motion; Secondly, we will consider the evolution law for the new motion under outside potential, when the potential
U (x, t) is a constant U , the evolution equation will be

i¯h

∂ψ(x, t)
∂t

= −

¯h2
2m

·

∂2ψ(x, t)

∂x2 + U · ψ(x, t)

then when the potential U (x, t) is related to x and t, the above equation will also essentially determine the evolution
equation, it is

for three-dimension situation the equation will be

i¯h

∂ψ(x, t)
∂t

i¯h

∂ψ(x, t)
∂t

¯h2
2m

= −

· ∇2ψ(x, t) + U(x, t) · ψ(x, t)

this is just the Schr¨odinger equation in quantum mechanics, thus we have deduced the Axiom IV of quantum mechanics
[7] [9].

On the other hand, according to the Axiom II of quantum mechanics, every observable of the system corresponds to a
self-adjoint operator in the Hilbert state space, and in general the relations of these observables can be extended to the
corresponding operators, thus the above evolution equation of new motion can be reduced to the familiar nonrelativistic
energy equality E = p2/m + U , and the equation can be rewritten as ˆEψ(x, t) = ˆp2/mψ(x, t) + U(ˆx, t)ψ(x, t), where
ˆE = i¯h∂/∂t, and ˆp = −i¯h∇.

At last, the above analysis also shows that the state function ψ(x, t) provides a complete description of the quan-
tum discontinuous motion, since the new motion is completely described by the measure density ρ(x, t) and measure
ﬂuid density j(x, t), and according to the above evolution equation the state function ψ(x, t) can be formulated
by these two functions, namely ψ(x, t) = ρ1/2 · eiS(x,t)/¯h, where S(x, t) = m
( Note: when

=

in three-dimension space, the formula for S(x,y,z,t) will be S(x, y, z, t) = m
m
, since in general there exists the relation
∇ × {j(x, y, z, t)/ρ(x, y, z, t)} = 0 when ρ(x, y, z, t) 6= 0), and these two functions can also be expressed by the state
function, namely ρ(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|2 and j(x, t) = [ψ∗∂ψ/∂t − ψ∂ψ∗/∂t]/2i, thus there exists a one-to-one relation
between (ρ(x, t), j(x, t)) and ψ(x, t), and the state function ψ(x, t) also provides a complete description of the quantum
discontinuous motion.

On the other hand, we can see that the absolute phase of the wave function ψ(x, t), which may depends on time in
nonrelativistic domain, is useless for describing the new motion, since according to the above analysis it disappears in
the measure density ρ(x, t) and measure ﬂuid density j(x, t), which completely describe the quantum discontinuous
motion, thus from the point of view of the new motion it is natural that the absolute phase of the wave function
possesses no physical meaning.

7. Axiom V of quantum mechanics
As we know, quantum mechanics is self-consistent when deﬁned by the above four axioms, since the elucidation about
the corresponding relation between the physical reality and mathematical language is just a conditional statement,
namely if the measurement about the quantum system brings about only one deﬁnite result, then the probability
distribution of the measurement results will satisfy the formula, say for the discrete observable, P = |ψ|2; but if only

8

the above four axioms are included, quantum mechanics will be evidently incomplete, since it does not describe the
real measurement result, thus its founders resorted to the projection postulate or Axiom V [7] [9] in order to account
for the measurement process, whereas this postulate is still a direct description about the measurement result, it says
nothing about how the measurement can and does bring about one deﬁnite result, so it needs to be further explained in
physics, now the new motion of particle just provide such a broad framework for objectively studying the microscopic
world that it may solve the collapse problem, for example, there may exist many kinds of concrete motion modes
among the new motion, and the new motion may display diﬀerently in the nonrelativistic and relativistic domains,
especially when involving gravity the new motion of particle may naturally result in the objective collapse process,
but owing to the weird diﬃculty of this problem, we will tackle it in another paper.

8. The value of ¯h in quantum mechanics
Up to now, one problem is still left, it is how to determine the value of ¯h in quantum mechanics or our world,
according to the above analysis we only know that the constant ¯h possesses a ﬁnite nonzero value, certainly, just like
the other physical constants such as c and G, its value can be determined by the experience, but its existence need
to be explained, and the above analysis about the new motion can provide the answer, namely the existence of ¯h
essentially results from the irreducibility of the nonlocal momentum deﬁnition, or nonexistence of the velocity or local
momentum of the particle undergoing the new motion, this kind of irreducibility denotes that momentum is no longer
related to space-time or velocity as for classical continuous motion, it is also an essential property of the new motion
just like position, especially it provides an equivalent nonlocal description of the new motion, while position provides a
local description of the new motion, this equivalence further results in the one-to-one relation between these two kinds
of descriptions, then it is just this one-to-one relation which requires the existence of a certain constant ¯h to cancel
out the unit of the physical quantities px and Et in the relation, at the same time, the existence of ¯h also indicates
some kind of balance between the properties( concretely speaking, their value distribution dispersions ) limited by
the one-to-one relation ( there is no such limitation for classical continuous motion and ¯h = 0 ), or we can say, the
existence of ¯h essentially indicates some kind of balance between the nonlocality and locality of the new motion in
space-time.

Certainly, the new motion provides a broader motion framework for the particle in microscopic world, in which we
can understand the weird displays of the microscopic objects objectively and consistently, which can not be grasped
consistently in the old framework of classical continuous motion, but it can not give the concrete value of ¯h in our
world by itself, as special relativity can not determine the value of light velocity c, or general relativity can not
determine the value of gravity constant G, surely, there may exist some deeper reasons for the particular value of ¯h in
our universe, but the new motion can not determine this value alone, the solution may have to resort to other subtle
realities in this world, for example, gravity (G), space-time(c), or even the existence of mankind.

V. THE CONFIRMATION OF THE NEW MOTION

In the following, we will give two main methods to conﬁrm the new motion underlying the wave function in

microscopic world.

A. Protective measurement

The ﬁrst method is called protective measurement [11] [12], it aims at measure the new motion state of a single
particle through repeatedly measuring it without destroying its state, in real experiment a small ensemble of similar
particles may be required. By use of this kind of measurement, the new motion state or wave function of a particle
does not change appreciably when the measurement is being made on it, its clever way is to let the system undergo
a suitable interaction so that it is in a non-degenerate eigenstate of the whole Hamiltonian, then the measurement
is made adiabatically so that the new motion state described by the wave function neither changes appreciably nor
becomes entangled with the measurement device, this suitable interaction is called the protection.

In the following, we will demonstrate how to use the protective measurement to conﬁrm the new motion of a single
particle in microscopic world, which is described by the wave function and Schr¨odinger equation, for simplicity but
lose no generality, we only consider a particle in a discrete nondegenerate energy eigenstate ψ(x), the interaction
Hamiltonian for measuring the value of an observable An in this state is:H = g(t)P An, which couples the system to
a measuring device, with coordinate and momentum denoted respectively by Q and P , where An is the normalized
projection operator on small regions Vn having volume vn, namely:

9

An =

1
vn ,
0,

(cid:26)

if x ∈ Vn,
if x 6∈ Vn.

(3)

the time-dependent coupling g(t) is normalized to

T
0 g(t)dt = 1, we let g(t) = 1/T for most of the time T and
assume that g(t) goes to zero gradually before and after the period T to obtain an adiabatic process when T → ∞, the
R
initial state of the pointer is taken to be a Gaussian centered around zero, and the canonical conjugate P is bounded
and also a motion constant not only of the interaction Hamiltonian, but of the whole Hamiltonian.

Now using this kind of protective measurement, the measurement of An yields the result:

hAni =

|ψ|2dv = |ψn|2

1
vn ZVn

the result |ψn|2 is just the average of the measure density ρ(x) = |ψ(x)|2 over the small region Vn, so when vn → 0
and after performing measurements in suﬃciently many regions Vn we can ﬁnd the measure density ρ(x) of the new
motion state of the measured particle.

Then we will measure the measure current density j(x) of the new motion state, namely we need measure the value
of an observable Bn in this state, where Bn = 1
2i (An∇ + ∇An), the measurement result will be hBni, ant it is just
the average value of the measure ﬂuid density j(x) = 1
2i (ψ∗∇ψ − ψ∇ψ∗) in the region Vn, so when vn → 0 and after
performing measurements in suﬃciently many regions Vn, we can also ﬁnd the measure ﬂuid density j(x) of the new
motion state of the measured particle.

Thus we have demonstrated that the new motion of a single particle, which is described by the measure density ρ(x)
and measure ﬂuid density j(x), or the abstract wave function ψ(x), can be conﬁrmed through the above protective
measurement.

B. Standard impulse measurement

Certainly, the standard impulse measurement in quantum mechanics [7] can also conﬁrm the new motion of a single
particle described by the wave function in microscopic world, its wrinkle lies in that we ﬁrst prepare an ensemble
of a large number of particles in the same state of new motion, then using this kind of measurement measure every
particle in the ensemble only one time, and we need not repeatedly measure the same particle, thus even if the state
of the new motion or wave function of a single particle will be destroyed after each measurement so that the following
measurement will no longer reveal the real information about the original state of new motion, but according to
quantum mechanics, all the individual measurement results about the ensemble can reveal the state of the ensemble,
and also the state of the new motion of a single particle in the ensemble, since every particle in the ensemble is in the
same state of new motion.

C. Understanding the wave function in terms of new motion

As we know, many ontological interpretations of quantum mechanics still consider the wave function as one kind of
objective ﬁeld, as Bell said, ”No one can understand this theory until he is willing to think of ψ as a real objective ﬁeld
rather than a ’probability amplitude’” [10], but the diﬃculties involved in this kind of ontological interpretation had
been pointed out since the beginning of quantum mechanics, for example, the existence of complex wave function, the
multidimensionality of the wave function and the representation problem etc can not be solved in the framework of
objective ﬁeld, these diﬃculties greatly prevented physicists from accepting the objective view about the microscopic
object described by the wave function. Now, according to the new quantum discontinuous motion, we can easily
overcome these diﬃculties in the framework of objective particle:

(1). As to the problem of complex wave function, since the wave function is not one kind of objective ﬁeld at
all, it is just one kind of indirect abstract mathematical symbol, which is used to describe the objective quantum
discontinuous motion of the particles in microscopic world, concretely speaking, it is an abstract complex of the
measure density ρ(x, t) and measure ﬂuid density j(x, t), which directly describe the state of the new motion in
physics, and its appearance essentially results from the symmetry involved in the new motion and the resulting linear
evolution principle, thus whether the wave function is complex or not is not a problem for the new motion described
by the wave function.

10

(2). The multidimensionality of the wave function is very natural from the point of view of new motion of particle,
as we know, the measure density ρ(x, t), or wave function ψ(x, t) for a single particle depends on three space variables,
and as to two particles generally we can not deﬁne their respective measure densities ρ1(x, t) and ρ2(x, t), or wave
functions ψ1(x, t) and ψ2(x, t), whereas we should deﬁne their joint measure density ρ(x1, x2, t) according to point set
theory, which means the joint measure density of particle 1 in position x1 and particle 2 in position x2, this further
results in that the one-to-one relation is two-manifold Fourier transformation involving the wave function ψ(x1, x2, t),
which depends on six space variables, namely

ψ(x1, x2, t) =

ϕ(p1, p2, t)ei(x1

·

p1+x2

p2)dp1dp2

·

+

∞

+

∞

Z

and Schr¨odinger equation for this two-particle situation is

i¯h

∂ψ(x1, x2, t)
∂t

¯h2
2m

= −

[∇2

1 + ∇2

2]ψ(x1, x2, t) + U (x1, x2, t) · ψ(x1, x2, t)

(16)

(17)

Certainly, when these two particles are independent, the joint measure density ρ(x1, x2, t) can be reduced to
ρ1(x1, t)ρ2(x2, t), and the joint wave function ψ(x1, x2, t) can also be reduced to ψ1(x1, t)ψ2(x2, t).

Certainly, as Bohr had taught us, if one does not wander about quantum mechanics he surely has not understood
this theory yet.
Indeed, the quantum discontinuous motion in microscopic world is extremely diﬀerent from the
familiar classical continuous motion in macroscopic world, so it is natural that the experience from classical mechanics
contradicts the picture of new motion, especially the particle undergoing the new motion can move far away in a very
small time interval, or even inﬁnitesimal time interval, which appears to conﬂict with the local spreading of energy, but
in fact, this just provides the objective origin of quantum nonlocality, which has been conﬁrmed in experiments; on
the other hand, when conﬁrming this kind of weird display of new motion we have to consider the more weird quantum
measurement, which needs to be further studied in another paper, but here we should keep in mind something, namely
when we go into the new ﬁeld of quantum discontinuous motion, we should re-understand the meaning of everything
in principle, including energy and the accepted law that it moves locally or even the concept of particle, if we still use
them, in one word, our understanding about reality can only be determined by the reality itself, not our belief.

VI. EXPLAINING THE WEIRD DISPLAY OF THE WAVE FUNCTION IN TERMS OF NEW MOTION

At last, we will give two familiar examples, which have evidently manifested the existence of new motion in

microscopic world, to explain the weird displays of the wave function in terms of the new motion of particle.

The ﬁrst is the base state of Hydrogen atom, its position distribution density, which can be found through the

above measurements, is written in the following:

ρ(x) = |ψ(x)|2 =

· exp(−

4
a0

2r
a0

)

(18)

According to the new motion of the particle, at any instant the electron will be in only one position in space,
but during inﬁnitesimal time interval [t,t+dt], the electron will move throughout the whole space where the above
function does not equal to zero, and its position measure density will be the same as the above position distribution
density function obtained from the wave function, thus during inﬁnitesimal time interval [t,t+dt], according to Gauss
theorem the charge distribution of the whole system will be equivalent to the zero charge distribution for the outside
observer, and there exists no change of the whole charge distribution either, so it can be easily understood that no
energy is radiated during ﬁnite time interval, as well as during inﬁnitesimal time interval, this is just the objective
origin of the mysterious stability in atom world.

The second example is the double-slit experiment, people have been trying to understand the formation process of
the double-slit interference pattern objectively, but few people can give an ontological description for it up to now, the
essential reason, as we think, is that people all ignored the diﬀerence between instant and inﬁnitesimal time interval.
By means of the new quantum discontinuous motion of the particle, the mystery of this process can be disclosed,
the real process should be that the particle undergoing the new motion passes through both slits in the double-slit
experiment, this means that the particle is still in only one of the two slits at any instant, but during the time interval
∆t, which can approach to zero, the particle moves throughout both slits and passes through them, and the position
measure density of the particle always satisﬁes the function ρ(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|2, which is ﬁnite and the same in both
slits. Since the particle undergoing the new motion can pass through both slits in this objective way, we can more
easily understand the forming of double-slit interference pattern, which is not a simple superposition of two one-slit
interference patterns.

11

VII. CONCLUSIONS

On the whole, a new point of view about the motion of the particle is presented to interpret the weird display of the
wave function describing the microscopic object, in mathematics, the point set theory casts a new light on the study
of physical motion, especially through deeply analyzing the regular dense point set, we present a new kind of motion,
which is called quantum discontinuous motion contrary to classical continuous motion. Then the physical meaning
of this new motion is carefully examined, at the same time, we give a strict physical deﬁnition about the quantum
discontinuous motion, and show that the notorious wave function is just a mathematical complex describing the new
motion of the microscopic particle, and Schr¨odinger equation in quantum mechanics is just the simplest nonrelativistic
evolution equations for the new motion, especially the consistent axiom system of quantum mechanics is also deduced
out. At last, the protective measurement and standard impulse measurement are used to conﬁrm the existence of the
new motion of the microscopic particle described by the wave function, and two famous examples are also given to
explain the weird display of the wave function in terms of new motion.

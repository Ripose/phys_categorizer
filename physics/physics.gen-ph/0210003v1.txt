Abstract

One calls attention to the fact that the stochastic dynamic systems are not
random completely. They have both random and regular components of their
evolution. Determinitic dynamic system is considered to be a special case of
dynamic system with vanishing stochastic component of evolution. Mathe-
matical technique for description of regular evolution component of dynamic
systems (stochastic and deterministic) is costructed. The regular component
evolution is described explicitly by the statistical average

Existence of regular component in evolution of stochastic systems forces us to
work with stochastic systems as with dynamic systems whose evolution is spoiled
by presence of random component. We shall consider stochastic system
Sst as a
dynamic system and shall refer to it as nondeterministic (or stochastic) dynamic
system. Dynamic system
Sd, whose evolution does not contain random component,
will be referred to as deterministic dynamic system. The term ”dynamic system”

random component of evolution, and
At construction of dynamics (theory of dynamic systems evolution) only regular
component of evolution is important, because only it can be reproduced at repeated
experiments. Only regular component can be calculated and tested in experiment.
For this reason dynamics (of deterministic and nondeterministic dynamic systems)
is a conception, whose basic element must be an object connected directly with the
regular component of the dynamic system evolution. Such a simplest element is a
pure statistical ensemble of dynamic systems, but not a single dynamic system.

inside the volume dX of the phase space. Thus, for description of the stochastic
system evolution one needs essentially more information, than for description of the

For nonrelativistic stochastic system the state X is a point in the phase space,

In this case at the proper normalization the quantity n (X) can be interpreted as a
probability density. The quantity dN = d(X)dX may be regarded as the number of

Particle and antiparticle are two diﬀerent states of one physical object – world
line. The world line, considered to be a physical object (but not as a method of
description of the particle evolution) will be denoted by WL. It should keep in mind
that consideration of a particle and an antiparticle as two diﬀerent states of WL
is connected with the circumstance that consideration of evolution of the dynamic
system in the reverse direction is necessary, if we want, that the number of dynamic
systems conserves in the dynamic theory, and in the same time the theory could
describe such processes as production and annihilation of particle pairs. If a particle
and an antiparticle are considered to be two diﬀerent dynamic systems distinguishing
in value of some parameter, then in the process of particle – antiparticle annihilation
the number of dynamic systems decreases by two units. It is unclear, how one could
describe a change of number of dynamic systems in the classical theory.
If one
assumes that particle and antiparticle are two diﬀerent states of a dynamic system
(WL), then one WL corresponds to a particle and minus one WL corresponds to an
antiparticle. If for instance, there are a particle and an antiparticle, the total number
of dynamic systems (WLs) is equal to zero, and this number does not change in the
process of annihilation. Thus, to conserve the number of physical objects (dynamic

systems) in the dynamic theory, it is necessary to consider distributions d(X), where
d may be any real number.

In
particular, d(X) cannot be regarded as the probability density. For instance, the
state, where the number of physical objects is equal to 1, cannot be considered as the

or the state with three particles and two antiparticles, etc.. But such a description of

The role of this stochasticity is the more, the less is the particle mass. It means
that the deterministic motion of particles should be explained via stochastic one,
but not vice versa, as one attempted to do earlier, when the particle motion in the
space-time was considered to be primordially deterministic.

fact that the action (2.4) contain derivatives only in direction of the vector jk in
the form jk∂k
(∂kjk = 0). In this case the system of partial diﬀerential equations
reduces to the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. For the action (2.4) describe

For the action (2.4) describes a statistical ensemble of stochastic systems , it is
suﬃcient that the action contains derivatives in direction normal to the ﬂux vec-
tor jkand in the same time the action (2.4) transforms according to (2.11) at the
transformation (2.9) of the number of the ensemble elements.

Let us imagine now that the Lagrangian function in the action (2.4) depends
additionally on the arguments sk = h∂k log ρ = hk∂k log j0,
skl = hkl∂k∂l log ρ,
k, l = 0, 1, ...n, (there is no summation over k and l here), where hk, hkl are some
constants. Arguments sk and skl are invariant with respect to transformation (2.9).
If the Lagrangian function L in (2.4) depends on sk and skl it transforms under
transformation (2.9) in the same way as if it would not depend on sk and skl. It
means that it remains to be the action for some statistical ensemble of independent

dynamic systems. But now the action contains derivatives not only in the direc-
tion of the vector jk. Then the system of dynamic equations is essentially such a
system of partial diﬀerential equations, which cannot be reduced to a system of or-
dinary diﬀerential equations. Hence, the statistical ensemble cannot be considered
to be constituted of deterministic dynamic systems, because in this case dynamic
equations could be reduced to a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Such a
situation can be interpreted in the sense that elements of the statistical ensemble
are stochastic systems, and there exist no dynamic equations for them.

Of course, the same consideration is valid for other forms (2.12), (2.2), (2.16) of
the action. In particular, if the Hamilton function H (x, p) in (2.16) is taken in the

It is worth to note that the quantum mechanics makes predictions, concerning
only M-measurements. Any quantum mechanical prediction can be tested only
by means of M-measurement. There is no quantum mechanical predictions that
could be tested by means of one single measurement (S-measurement). Result of
individual measurement (S-measurement) of the quantity
can be predicted never.
Using quantum mechanical technique, one can predict only probability of the fact
the result R′ will be obtained. But a
that at the S-measurement of the quantity
prediction of the result probability does not mean a prediction of the result in itself.
To understand what means the prediction of the result probability from the
measurement viewpoint, let us consider the following situation. Let a calculation on
the basis of quantum mechanics technique gives, that the probability of obtaining
the result R′ at the measurement of the quantity
ψ
i
is equal to 1/2. How can one test that this probability is equal to 1/2, but not, for
instance, to 3/4 or 1/4? It is clear that it is impossible at one single measurement

individual measurements, and the part of measurements, where the value R′ of
the quantity
is obtained, gives the value of probability. It is valid even in the
case, when predicted probability is equal to unity. In this case for the test of the
prediction an individual experiment is also insuﬃcient. To test the prediction, one
needs to carry out a set of many individual measurements of the quantity
, and
the prediction will be valid, provided the value R′ is obtained in all cases.

At this point the quantum mechanics distinguishes from the classical mechanics,
where results of repeated measurements coincide. The classical mechanics accepts
that two diﬀerent individual measurements, produced on the system at the same
state give similar results. The classical mechanics supposes that it is possible one
not to test this circumstance, and it predicts the value R′ of the measured quantity
(probability of the value R′ is accepted to be equal to 1 and is not tested). The

R
deterministic foundation of classical mechanics is manifested in this assumption.

Describing stochastic systems, the quantum mechanics admits that two diﬀerent
individual measurements, produced on the systems prepared in the same way, may
give diﬀerent results, and quantum mechanics predicts only probability of the value
(but not the value R′ itself). At the test only value
R′ of the measured quantity
of the probability is veriﬁed (it is tested, even if this value is equal to 1 or to 0).

can be made only by classical mechanics, which deals only with deterministic dy-
namics systems. If some of dynamic systems are stochastic, then even deterministic
dynamic system are to be considered to be a special case dynamic systems, and
predictions of the second type are impossible. The quantum mechanics deals with
stochastic systems. It can make only prediction of the second type, even in the given
case, when the dynamic system evolves as a deterministic one. This fact is connected
with the above considered statement that in the theory of the stochastic systems

Let us consider now well known paradox of ”Schr¨odinger cat”. At ﬁrst, let us

While the atom is not decayed, the cat is alive. As soon as the atom decays, the
cat becomes dead. The state of the atom is a linear superposition of states of the
indecomposed atom and decomposed atom. Respectively the state of the cat is a
linear superposition of the alive cat and of the dead one. Paradox consists in the
simultaneous existence of the dead cat and of the alive cat. If one opens the chamber
and observes the cat, the cat passes instantly from the state, where the cat is neither
dead, nor alive, to the deﬁnite state, where the cat is either dead, or alive.

Finally, if we carry out a selective mass measurement (SM-measurement, i.e.

there are alive cats, then, on one hand, one obtains a deﬁnite result (alive cats), but
on the other hand, there is many alive cats and they form a statistical ensemble,
whose state is described by a certain deﬁnite wave function. But any paradox does
not appears, as far as the reason of a change of the wave function of statistical

The Schr¨odinger cat paradox is a special case of the paradox, which is discerned
sometimes in the wave function reduction, appearing as a result of a measurement.
To avoid this paradox, it is suﬃcient to follow a simple logic rule, which asserts:
” One may not use the same term for notation of diﬀerent objects.
(But it is
admissible to use several diﬀerent terms for notation of the same object.)”. Usually
this rule is violated. One uses the same term for the individual object and for the
statistical average object. As a corollary one uses the same term for two diﬀerent
measurement processes.

Note that the formal representation of M-measurement as a single act of inﬂuence
on the statistical average system
makes a large contribution into identiﬁcation of
S -measurement with M-measurement. This representation removes distinction be-
tween the S-measurement and the M-measurement and gives the impression that S-
measurement and the M-measurement are identical procedures. After such an iden-

hSi

hSi

tiﬁcation the measurement process would begin to take on contradictory properties.
On one hand, such a measurement leads to a deﬁnite result (S-measurement), on the
other hand, its result is a distribution of the measured quantity (M-measurement).
On one hand, the measurement (S-measurement) is a single act, produced on
,
S
and the measurement does not bear on the wave function, and on the statistical
. On the other hand, the measurement (M-measurement) leads
average system
to a reduction of the state of the system

hSi
In general, violation of the formal logic rule cited above is only a premise for
appearance of paradoxes and contradictions, but this violation does not lead to
paradoxes with a necessity. Unfortunately, only a few of investigators, using a rep-
resentation on M-measurement as a single act, succeeded to avoid identiﬁcation of
S-measurement and M-measurement and inconsistencies following from this identi-
ﬁcation. One of these few investigators was J. von Neumann. In his monograph [8]
he employed the same term for individual and statistical average objects. Neverthe-
less, he obtains never inconsistencies and paradoxes. However, ordinary investiga-
tors, who have not powerful intellect of von Neumann, are recommended to follow
the simple logic rule cited above.

.

As soon as one follows this simple rule, many exotic interpretation are removed
by themselves. For instance, the Everett – Weeler interpretation [12, 13], founded
on the erroneous conception, that a measurement with an individual system (S-
measurement) changes its wave function.

It should note that sometimes it is diﬃcult to determine whether some property
is a property of an individual object or that of a statistical average one. For in-
stance, whether the half-integer spin of an electron is a property of a single electron
or a property of statistical average electron (statistical ensemble). At the conven-
tional approach, when one does not distinguish between an individual electron and
a statistical average electron, such a problem does not exist. At a more careful
approach we are forced to state that properties of an individual electron have been
investigated very slightly. In most of cases we deal with measurements, produced
on many electrons, as far as only such experiments are reproducible. As a corollary
many conclusions on properties of a single electron are unreliable.

For instance, it is a common practice to consider the Stern – Gerlach experi-
ment (when the electron beam, passing the region with inhomogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld, splits into two beams) to be an evidence of the statement that each single
electron has a deﬁnite spin and corresponding projection of magnetic moment onto
the magnetic ﬁeld direction. In reality, the Stern – Gerlach experiment shows only
that the Hamiltonian, describing a motion of statistical average electron, has two
discrete eigenstates, labelled by the magnetic quantum number and distinguishing
by their energy. The question, whether discreteness of the magnetic quantum num-
ber is connected with a discreteness in properties of a single electron, remains open,
because a discreteness of energy levels is not connected directly with the discrete
character of interaction. For instance, the energy levels of a spinless charged particle
in the Coulomb electric ﬁeld are discrete, although there is no discreteness in the
properties of a single particle. It is doubtless that the beam split is connected with

17

”the electron magnetic moment”, because it is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld
gradient. But the question remains open, whether the ”electron magnetic moment’
is a property of the individual electron
or a collective property of the statistical
average electron
the problem does not appear.

(see for details [14]). Note that at identiﬁcation of

Sometimes one considers, that the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, em-
anated by an excited atom is a property of individual (but not statistical average)
atom. The argument is adduced that the modern technique admits one to conﬁne
a single atom in a trap. Then one can investigate its energy levels and spectrum
of radiation. But one overlooks that the spectrum of the atom radiation cannot be
measured as a result of a single measurement (S -measurement). The atom radia-
tion spectrum is obtained as a result of many measurements of radiation of the same
atom, whose state is prepared by the same way, i.e. that essentially one measures
radiation of a statistical average atom. To carry out such a M-measurement, it
is of no importance, whether one produces one measurement with many similarly
prepared atoms, or one produces many measurements with a single atom, preparing
its state many times by the same way. In both cases one deals with the statistical
average atom.

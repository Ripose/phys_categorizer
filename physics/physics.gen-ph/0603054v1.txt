Abstract

The properties of cyclic structures (toroidal oscillators) based on classi-
cal tripolar (colour) ﬁelds are discussed, in particular, of a cyclic structure
formed of three colour-singlets spinning around a ring-closed axis. It is
shown that the helicity and handedness of this structure can be related
to the quantum properties of the electron. The symmetry of this struc-
ture corresponds to the complete cycle of 2
3 π-rotations of its constituents,
which leads to the exact overlapping of the paths of its three comple-
mentary coloured constituents, making the system dynamically colour-
less. The gyromagnetic ratio of this system is estimated to be g≈ 2,
which agrees with the Land´e g-factor for the electron. PACS: 05.65.+b,

1 Introduction

It is widely accepted that quantum and classical mechanics, despite being con-
ceptually diﬀerent, are intimately related [1], which can be seen, for instance,
in the necessity to describe any quantum object in the context of a classical
system (measuring device). Practical applications of quantum mechanics, e.g.,
in quantum computing, also show that quantum information can only be trans-
mitted in conjunction with classical signalling [2]. There exist many similarities
between classical and quantum phenomena, although they occur in completely
diﬀerent contexts [3]. This leads to the possibility of describing deterministic
systems with the use of quantum-mechanical formalism and vice-versa, thus ar-
riving at a deeper understanding of irreversibility, causality and unpredictability
concepts, as was shown by I. Prigogine [4]. Nowadays, exploring the mechanisms
responsible for the appearance of a classical world through decoherence of quan-
tum systems is regarded as one of the main tasks of quantum mechanics [5].

1

For instance, it is conceivable that a regular pattern could emerge as a result
of interactions between purely chaotic systems [6]. A series of models show-
ing the possibility of mapping the quantum states of a system onto the states
of a completely deterministic model were discussed recently by G. t’Hooft [7],
O. V. Prezhdo [8], and others [9].

On the other hand, many physicists explore the opposite possibility that
quantum phenomena could arise as a result of information loss due to non-
reversible dissipative processes and self-organisation in nonlinear deterministic
systems [10]. From this point of view, it is conceivable that quantum ﬁeld theo-
ries could be underlied by classical mechanics [12], with quantum uncertainties
also having a deterministic origin [13]. Indeed, there exist models showing that
a classical system can manifest itself quantum-mechanically [11].

In this paper we shall follow this lead and examine two examples of classical
tripolar oscillators, whose properties may well be identiﬁed with the quantum
properties of the electron and its neutrino. Of course, today’s commonly-held
view is that these particles are point-like quantum objects whose classical de-
scription is impossible because the microscopic reality is controlled by non-
commuting operators, and the more so because quantum models are able to
account for most of the experimental data [14]. However, P. A. M. Dirac, the
creator of quantum theory of the electron, warned that his point-electron model
was actually a mathematical approximation, not conforming to current physical
ideas [15]. Indeed, the point model of a charged particle is physically unstable
and requires the density of the particle’s rest mass-energy to be inﬁnite. Ac-
cording to the laws of electrodynamics, a point charge would have to have a
zero spin and zero magnetic moment. Thus, the laws of magnetism dictate that
the electron must have some physical extent to have a magnetic moment. In
fact, modern quantum ﬁeld theories do smear the charge of the physical electron
over some extended region in order to renormalise the theory and produce ﬁnite
results [16].

Here we shall discuss a composite model of the electron based on classical
tripolar oscillators [17]. This approach reveals a broad spectrum of possible
structures:
it was found that, given an ensemble of colour-charged particles,
these particles would necessarily cohere in colour dipoles, tripoles, as well as
strings and molecule-like cyclic structures formed of these tripoles. The speciﬁc
conﬁguration of each structure and the number of its constituents were deter-
mined by the minimum of its eﬀective combined potential.
It was observed
that the properties of the emerging structures resemble those of the fundamen-
tal fermions. Based on this observation, in this paper we shall further explore
the properties of two simplest cyclic structures, which were identiﬁed with the
electron and its neutrino. We shall resume the proposed approach in the next
section. Afterwards, we shall show that this approach, although classical, nec-
essarily implies a probabilistic behaviour of systems. Then, in Sect. 4, we shall
discuss some properties of the cyclic structure identiﬁed with the electron. Fi-
nally, in Sect. 5, we shall estimate the gyromagnetic ratio of this system.

2 Two-component basic ﬁeld

As a starting point, we suggest that the electric and colour ﬁelds are uniﬁed
through their source – a kind of primitive particle, with no properties save its
mass and charge. That is, we assume that such a particle generates a dual
(split) equilibrium ﬁeld, F (ρ), with the following components:

ρ−1)

to each other by their common origin. Here the signature s =
1 indicates
the sense of the interaction; the derivative is taken with respect to the radial
coordinate, ρ. For the sake of simplicity, the amplitude and range coeﬃcients
in (1) are set to unity. We shall denote the energies corresponding to these
components of the ﬁeld (integrals over the entire range of ρ) as ˜m◦ and m◦,
respectively. Obviously, the second quantity, m◦, is unity, while ˜m◦ diverges,
implying that the above ﬁelds cannot exist in free states because of their in-
ﬁnite energies. The approximate antisymmetry between F⊖ and F⊕ in the
vicinity of their origin (see details in [17]) implies that, given a pair of primi-
tive particles with complementary colours/charges, these particles will combine
into an equilibrium conﬁguration (colour-dipole g0, g+ or g−), with the aver-
age distance ρ◦ between its components such that the ﬁelds balance each other:
F⊕(ρ◦). This breaks the initial spherical symmetry of the ﬁeld, as
F⊖(ρ◦) =
well as yet another fundamental symmetry – that of scale invariance – since
there exists a distance ρ◦ which can be used as the basic unit length for this
model. Moreover, it is seen that the potential V (ρ), Fig. 1a, corresponding to

this ﬁeld is characterised not only by its inherent length unit, ρ◦, but also by

where ˆm−1 = m−1
is the reduced mass (here ˆm = 1
2 because for the sake of
simplicity in this example we ignore the third colour; but this does not matter for
understanding the point). The energy E0 of the initial state can be set to zero (at
ρ = 0), which deﬁnes the speed scale for this system (unit speed v◦) through the
magnitude of the maximal speed, vmax = v(ρ◦)
0.937. This also establishes
the time scale – by deﬁning the unit time, t◦, such that v◦t◦ = ρ◦. Thus, we
can see that the ﬁeld (1) is fully self-calibrated. Of course, we have to take into
account the fact that the colour dipole, as with its constituents – colour charges
– cannot exist in free states because it has only two of three possible diverging
components of the ﬁeld F⊖ that cancel one another. The colour components
could be cancelled either in a large ensemble of colour dipoles g0 (statistically)
or if three primitive particles were combined together – all with complementary
In the latter case, the cancelled energies of three
colours and like charges.
colour-ﬁelds will be converted into the binding energy of the structure. That is,
three like-charged primitive particles will necessarily cohere in a colour-neutral
(tripole) with radius
but electrically charged singlet – a
oscillating near the value ρ△ = ρ◦/√3. It is noted that the tripole is colour-
neutral only at inﬁnity: nearby its ﬁeld is colour-polarised since the centres of its
components do not coincide. This implies that diﬀerent tripoles can be further
combined because of their residual chromaticism. Using the ﬁelds (1) one can
compute the pairwise forces between the colour-charges in a particular tripole
cluster and estimate the energy of this cluster in order to ﬁnd its equilibrium
conﬁguration with minimal energy. These calculations can easily be made for
some simple conﬁgurations but the computational diﬃculties grow dramatically
with the complexity of the structures.

3 Uncertainty of the ﬁeld

One can see that the ﬁeld (1) necessarily implies an uncertainty, precluding the
exact determination of particle trajectories. Indeed, let us consider the initial
state of the simplest system formed of two primitive charges – a colour-dipole
g+. For the sake of simplicity let us ignore for a moment the third colour
and analyse a two-body problem, which is known to have an exact analytical
solution. It follows from (2) that the dipole components are conﬁned within the
region ρ
1.894ρ◦, the particle speed vanishing
at the ends of this interval. As we have already seen, the individual sources of
the ﬁeld (1) cannot exist in free states because this would lead to their inﬁnite
energies. This means that we cannot choose ρ =
to be the initial state of
our system. Therefore, the only available natural initial states of the dipole
correspond to ρ = ρmax and ρ = 0 (a superposition of particles in the origin)

will be inﬁnite, which is what one would expect because of a stationary point
at the origin, F ′
⊕(0) = 0. This is the bifurcation point of a typical
double-well potential V (ρ), Fig. 1a, which is known to lead to chaotic oscilla-
tions. In order to evolve from this state the system requires an external (albeit
inﬁnitesimally small) action. Thus, we ought to conclude that this system can-
not, in principle, be treated as isolated. That is, we have to take into account
the fact that at the initial moment of time an external system (e.g., the rest of
the universe) adds to (or removes from) our system some inﬁnitesimally small
portions of energy (which corresponds to the noise with zero expectation value).
Under this external action, the radius of our system will grow from zero to some
value, say, δρ, whilst the particle speed will increase by the value δv.

Within an ε-neighbourhood of the origin the proper interactions between
the two particles will be small compared to the external action, so that for some
period of time the system will be evolving chaotically. After exiting the ε-region,
this evolution will become more regular, and the particles will acquire both
radial and tangential components of their velocities (that is, the initial energy
of the system will be shared between its angular momentum and oscillatory
motion). Outside the ε-region the inﬂuence of the external system will be almost
unnoticeable, unless the particles occasionally penetrate back into this region.
An example of the trajectory of a colour-dipole inﬂuenced by an external system
and evolving from its initial state with ρ = 0 is shown in Fig. 1b (for δv =
0.001vmax). The same reasoning is applicable to the tripolar oscillators whose
evolution will be more complicated, but with the same net result:
it will be
impossible to dispose of the inﬂuence of the external system. Thus, we have to
arrive at the conclusion that within our framework no isolated systems could
exist in principle. Due to this, even in the simplest case of a two-body system,
the equations of motion are not analytically solvable, let alone the multi-body
systems corresponding to more complex composite particles. However, given
the smallness of the perturbations caused by the external system, its inﬂuence
should be noticeable only under extreme conditions when all the particles are
squeezed into a very small volume.
In most of the other cases, the presence
of the external system will be perceivable only by small deviations from the
particles’ trajectories.

Thus, separated by distance ρ > 2ρ◦, two tripoles will tend to combine into a
doublet conﬁguration (d+ or d−) with ζ = π. The neutral doublet

can also be formed. The width of the potential well for ζ = π and ρ > 2ρ◦
allows a certain degree of rotational freedom for the paired tripoles, so that the
3 π < ζ < 4
position angle can oscillate within 2
3 π. We shall use the symbols ↾ and
⇂ to denote, respectively, the clockwise and anticlockwise directions of rotation.
Then, the rotational oscillations of the doublet can be represented as

↾ ⇄ d+

or

↾ ⇄ d◦

The ζ-dependence of both strength and sign of the bond force between the
tripoles implies that the distance ρ is covariant with the position angle ζ,
i.e., that the translational and rotational oscillations of the doublet d are syn-
chronous.

It follows that due to the 2π

3 -symmetry of the tripoles their rotations in a
chain of like-charged tripoles can cyclically repeat after each three links:

In a similar way, one can ﬁnd that, given a chain of unlike-charged pairs of

which we shall denote as X = 6

It is seen that the charges constituting a cyclic structure can spin around
its ring-closed axis. In the case of the triplet, Y, this will generate a toroidal
(ring-closed) magnetic ﬁeld which will force these charges to move along the
torus. This orbital motion will generate a secondary (poloidal) magnetic ﬁeld,
contributing to the spin of these charges around the ring-axis, and so forth, until

the charges reach their maximal speed, say, v◦. Such a dynamo mechanism for
generating a self-consistent magnetic ﬁeld is studied in detail in astrophysics [18]
and solar physics [19]. It is also used for stabilisation of toroidal plasma ﬂows
in the tokamak fusion reactors [20]. The only diﬀerence between the standard
dynamo models and our case is that the Y-structure here does not require any
external angular momentum to maintain its magnetic ﬁeld. The trajectories
of charges (currents) are clockwise, Y↾, or anticlockwise, Y⇂, helices (Smale-
Williams curves), which, by their closure, make a π-twist around the ring-closed
axis of the structure (Fig. 2b). Such a twisting dislocation of the phase is known
as the topological charge [21], also called the dislocation index, which has a sign
corresponding to the winding direction (clockwise or anticlockwise) and the
magnitude related to the winding number per 2π-orbit path. In these terms,
the π-phase shift of the currents in the structures X and Y corresponds to the
topological charge S =

It is worth noticing that, since the 2

3 π-symmetry of the tripole is reproduced
on a higher hierarchical level – in the structure Y – the path of each colour-
charge belonging to a particular tripole overlaps exactly with the paths of two
other colour charges that belong to two other tripoles and whose colours are
complementary to the colour of the ﬁrst charge. This means that the trajectories
of charges (currents) in the structure Y are dynamically colourless (Fig. 2c). That
is, averaged in time, the ﬁeld of the triplet Y would have only two (positive and
negative) polarities corresponding to the conventional electric ﬁeld. The same
symmetry is also observed in the hexaplet whose currents are shown in Fig. 3b.
There are twelve current loops in this structure, six negative and six positive,
compared to the three unipolar loops in the triplet Y.

The colourlessness of the time-averaged ﬁelds of Y and X does not necessar-
ily imply that these particles cannot colour-interact with each other. On the
contrary, if the motions of their constituents are synchronised, these structures
will induce an attractive or repulsive force towards each other, additional to the
conventional electrostatic force. Thus, given a pair of triplets Y (or hexaplets
X) with opposite helicities (Y↾Y⇂), the mutual orientation of the tripoles in the
pair corresponds to an attractive force between them [see the diagram (4)],
whereas like-helicities (Y↾Y↾ or Y⇂Y⇂) correspond to repulsion [diagram (5)]. By
contrast, one can ﬁnd [17] that the pattern of repulsion and attraction between

ture. The antitripoles are coded with lighter colours.

the constituents is reversed in a mixed pair (X with Y), in which like-topological
charges attract each other and unlike ones repel. As a result, the combination
X↾Y↾ (or X⇂Y⇂) has an integral topological charge (SXY =
1). The combination
X↾Y⇂ would have a zero topological charge, but this system is unlikely to exist,
since the topological charges of X↾ and Y⇂ in this system are repulsive to each
other. The clustering of Y-particles (in our interpretation – electrons) is, in fact,
observed experimentally: it is known that the electrons can form clusters, e.g, in
extended media where they may undergo crystallisation at low densities, as has
been predicted by E. Wigner [22] and then shown by diﬀerent research groups
[23].

It is interesting to note that the momentum and angular momentum of the
hexaplet X in the structure XY are coupled to each other through the mag-
netic ﬁeld (see [17] for details). Given also the possibility of polarisation of
the hexaplet X when it is combined with the triplet Y, the above coupling of
momenta would result in the conjugation of charge and parity of the particles
X and Y (at the moment when they leave the system XY). Such a conjugation,
known as CP-symmetry, is observed in the β-decay products, e− and νe. Since
we have already identiﬁed the structures Y and X with, respectively, e and νe,
we can see that our model provides a natural explanation of the CP-symmetry
and of the neutrino left-handedness.

It is also found that the repulsive (or attractive) force between two helical
structures is maximal when their topological charges have half-integer mag-
nitudes. This force diminishes when the magnitude of one (or both) of the
topological charges deviates from the half-integer value and eventually decays
to zero when the magnitude of any of the topological charges takes an integral
value. This pattern of attraction and repulsion adheres to the Pauli exclusion
principle, and here we have deliberately chosen the symbols ↾ and ⇂ to denote
the opposite helicities (topological charges), implying that the helicity of a cyclic
structure is equivalent to the quantum notion of spin. This conjecture is also
supported by the fact that quantum spin is measured in units of angular mo-
mentum (~), and so too – the topological charge in question, which is derived
around the ring-closed axis of the
from the rotational motion of the tripoles

5 Magnetic moment of the triplet

It is instructive to estimate the magnetic moment of the looped currents of
the triplet Y, together with the corresponding gyromagnetic ratio. As we have
already noted, the charges moving within this structure trace helical trajectories,
which, by the closure of their 2π-paths along the ring-axis of Y are additionally
π-twisted around this axis. This means that each of these currents is formed
of two loops (see Fig. 4). The magnetic moment created by these loops can be

Since ρ2
1, the gyromagnetic ratio above is approximately equal to the
Y
number of current loops, gY
2. To derive this quantity more accurately one
has to account for the detailed solenoidal geometry of the currents in the triplet,
as well as for the radial oscillations of its constituents and of the whole structure.
Of course, the proportionality of the magnetic moment to the loop number
of a solenoid is a commonplace.
In fact, what we have shown in Eq. (10) is
that the gyromagnetic ratio of the triplet is slightly larger than 2, which agrees
with the experimental value (
2.002319) of the Land´e g-factor for the electron.
The value ge = 2 was explained quantum-mechanically by P.A.M.Dirac [24],
and, hitherto, it was assumed that this value could not be explained in terms of
classical mechanics because the classically-derived g-factor should be equal to
unity. We can see now that this is not necessarily so. Thus, without invoking any
ad hoc assumptions and based solely on ﬁrst-principles, i.e., on our conjecture
about the symmetry of the basic ﬁeld (1), we have found that practically all the
properties of the emerging triplet structure Y, including its gyromagnetic ratio,
match those of the electron, which makes it natural to identify the triplet with
the electron. Likewise, the properties of the hexaplet X suggest identifying it
with the electron-neutrino. Incidentally, since the discovery of the electron many
physicists explored the idea of a spinning structure in the form of a disk or ring
[25] in order to explain the properties of the electron, which led to important
discoveries. For example, it was A.Compton’s intention to determine the size of
the ring-electron that inspired him to perform his famous scattering experiments
[26]. The early models of the ring-electron were created as straightforward
interpretations of the observed properties of this particle but they could not
explain the magnitude of its magnetic moment.

10

Some modern physicists have revisited the old ideas, encouraged by progress
in the theory of rotating Kerr-Newman black holes [27] or toroidal magnetic
ﬁelds in helical plasma ﬂows [28]. Here, looking at the problem from a com-
pletely diﬀerent point of view we have unravelled a similar solenoidal structure
whose properties match surprisingly well those of the electron. Since our model
is pretty much in line with both old and modern ideas about the electron’s
structure, our identiﬁcation of the triplet and hexaplet with, respectively, the
electron and its neutrino is entirely natural and logical.

6 Conclusions

We have seen that a classical model with non-linear ﬁelds (1) can reproduce
the quantum properties of the electron and other elementary particles. Using
solely the symmetry of these ﬁelds we have been able to uncover the structure
formation and symmetry-breaking mechanisms, which are probably responsible
for the formation of the observed diversity of elementary particles. By deriving
their quantum properties in a classical way our model supports the assertion that
quantum mechanics could, indeed, arise from classical (albeit non-deterministic)
processes. The impossibility within our framework to deal with isolated systems
(Sect. 3) coheres with the ideas of A. Land´e who maintained [29] that uncertainty
is a physical principle equally important for both classical and quantum physics.

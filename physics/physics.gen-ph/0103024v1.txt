Duality and Cosmology

Abstract

In some recent theories including Quantum SuperString theory we
encounter duality - it arises due to a non commutative geometry which
in eﬀect adds an extra term to the Heiserberg Uncertainity Principle.
The result is that the micro world and the macro universe seem to be
linked. We show why this is so in the context of a recent cosmological
model and a physical picture emerges in the context of the Feynman-
Wheeler formulation of interactions.

1 Introduction

Nearly a century ago several Physicists including Lorentz, Poincare and
Abraham amongst others tackled unsuccessfully the problem of the extended
electron[1, 2]. An extended electron appeared to contradict Special Relativ-
ity, while on the other hand, the limit of a point particle lead to inexplicable
inﬁnities. Dirac ﬁnally formulated an equation in which the physically rele-
vant or ”renormalized” mass was ﬁnite and consisted of the bare mass and
the electromagnetic mass which become inﬁnite in the limit of point parti-
cles, no doubt, but the inﬁnities cancel one another. This approach lead to
non-causal eﬀects, which were circumvented by a formalism of Feynam and
Wheeler, in which the interaction of a charge with the rest of the universe
was considered, and also not just the point charge, but its neighbourhood
had to be taken into account.
These inﬁnities persisted for many decades. Infact the Heisenberg Uncertain-
ity Principle straightaway leads to inﬁnities in the limit of spacetime points.
It was only through the artiﬁce of renormalization that ’t Hooft could ﬁnally

1

circumvent this vexing problem, in the 1970s.
Nevertheless it has been realized that the concept of spacetime points is only
approximate[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. We are beginning to realize that it may be more
meaningful to speak in terms of spacetime foam, strings, branes, non com-
mutative geometry, fuzzy spacetime and so on[8]. This is what we will now
discuss.

2 Duality

We consider the well known theory of Quantum SuperStrings and also an ap-
proach in which an electron is considered to be a Kerr-Newman Black Hole,
with the additional input of fuzzy spacetime.
As is well known, String Theory originated from phenomenological consider-
ations in the late sixties through the pioneering work of Veneziano, Nambu
and others to explain features like the s-t channel dual resonance scattering
and Regge trajectories[9]. Originally strings were conceived as one dimen-
sional objects with an extension of the order of the Compton wavelength,
which would fudge the point vertices of the s-t channel scattering graphs, so
that both would eﬀectively correspond to one another (Cf.ref.[9]).
The above strings are really Bosonic strings. Raimond[10], Scherk[11] and
others laid the foundation for the theory of Fermionic strings. Essentially
the relativistic Quantized String is given a rotation, when we get back the
equation for Regge trajectories,

(2πT )−1M 2 +a0¯h with a0 = +1(+2)for the open (closed) string (1)

J

≤

When a0 = 1 in (1) we have gauge Bosons while a0 = 2 describes the gravi-
tons. In the full theory of Quantum Super Strings, or QSS, we are essentially
dealing with extended objects rotating with the velocity of light, rather like
spinning black holes. The spatial extention is at the Planck scale while fea-
tures like extra space time dimensions which are curled up in the Kaluza
Klein sense and, as we will see, non commutative geometry appear[12, 13].
We next observe that it is well known that the Kerr Newman of charged
spinning Black Hole itself mimics the electron remarkably well including the
purely Quantum Mechanical anomalous g = 2 factor[14]. The problem is
that there would be a naked singularity, that is the radius would become

where a is the angular momentum per unit mass.
This problem has been studied in detail by the author in recent years[15, 16].
Indeed it is quite remarkable that the position coordinate of an electron in
the Dirac theory is non Hermitian and mimics equation (2), being given by
ı
2
where the imaginary parts of (2) and (3) are both of the order of the Comp-
ton wavelength.
The key to understanding the unacceptable imaginary part was given by
Dirac himself[17], in terms of zitterbewegung. The point is that according
to the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle, space time points themselves are
not meaningful- only space time intervals have meaning, and we are really
speaking of averages over such intervals, which are atleast of the order of the
Compton scale. Once this is kept in mind, the imaginary term disappears
on averaging over the Compton scale.
In this formulation, the mass and charge of the electron arises due to zitter-
bewegung eﬀects at the Compton scale[15, 16]. These masses and charges are
renormalized in the sense of the Dirac mass in the classical theory, alluded
to in section 1.
Indeed, from a classical point of view also, in the extreme relativistic case, as
is well known there is an extension of the order of the Compton wavelength,
within which we encounter meaningless negative energies[18]. With this pro-
viso, it has been shown that we could think of an electron as a spinning Kerr
Newman Black Hole. This has received independent support from the work
of Nottale[19].
We are thus lead to the picture where there is a cut oﬀ in space time inter-
vals.
In the above two scenarios, the cut oﬀ is at the Compton scale (l, τ ) the
Planck scale being a special case for the Planck mass. Such discrete space
time models compatible with Special Relativity have been studied for a long
time by Snyder and several other scholars[20, 21, 22]. In this case it is well
known that we have the following non commutative geometry

[x, y] = (ıa2/¯h)Lz,[t, x] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mx,

3

[y, z] = (ıa2/¯h)Lx,[t, y] = (ıa2/¯hc)My,
[z, x] = (ıa2/¯h)Ly,[t, z] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mz,
where a is the minimum natural unit and Lx, Mx etc. have their usual sig-
niﬁcance.
Moreover in this case there is also a correction to the usual Quantum Me-
chanical commutation relations, which are now given by

(4)

[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2
x];

[t, pt] = ı¯h[1

(a/¯hc)2p2
t ];

−
[x, py] = [y, px] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpy;
[x, pt] = c2[px,t] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpt; etc.

(5)

where pµ denotes the four momentum.
In the Kerr Newman model for the electron alluded to above (or generally
¯h and of radius l), Lx etc. reduce to the spin
for a spinning sphere of spin
¯h
2 of a Fermion and the commutation relations (4) and (5) reduce to

∼

[x, y]

0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h[1 + βl2], [t, E] = ı¯h[1 + τ 2]

(6)

≈

where β = (px/¯h)2 and similar equations.
Interestingly the non commutative geometry given in (6) can be shown to
lead to the representation of Dirac matrices and the Dirac equation[23]. From
here we can get the Klein Gordon equation, as is well known[24, 25], or al-
ternatively we deduce the massless string equation.
This is also the case with superstrings where Dirac spinors are introduced,
as indicated above.
Infact in QSS also we have equations mathematically
identical to the relations (6) containing momenta (Cf.ref.[13]). This, which
implies (4), can now be seen to be the origin of non-commutativity.
The non commutative geometry and fuzzyness is contained in (6).
Infact
fuzzy spaces have been investigated in detail by Madore and others[26, 27],
and we are lead back to the equation (6). The fuzzyness which is closely
tied up with the non commutative feature is symptomatic of the breakdown
of the concept of the spacetime points and point particles at small scales
or high energies. As has been noted by Snyder, Witten, and several other
scholars, the divergences encountered in Quantum Field Theory are symp-
tomatic of precisely such an extrapolation to spacetime points and which

4

necessitates devices like renormalization. As Witten points out[28], ”in de-
veloping relativity, Einstein assumed that the space time coordinates were
Bosonic; Fermions had not yet been discovered!... The structure of space
time is enriched by Fermionic as well as Bosonic coordinates.”
A related concept, which one encounters also in String Theory is Duality.
Infact the relation (6) leads to,

wondered about the basis of (7), but as we have seen, it is a consequence of
(6).
This is an expression of the duality relation,

This is symptomatic of the fact that we cannot go down to arbitrarily small
spacetime intervals, below the Planck scale.
There is an interesting meaning to the duality relation arising from (7) in
the context of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole formulation. While it appears
that the ultra small is a gateway to the macro cosmos, we could look at it in
the following manner. The ﬁrst term of the relation (7) which is the usual
Heisenberg Uncertainity relation is supplemented by the second term which
refers to the macro cosmos.
Let us consider the second term in (7). We write ∆p = ∆Nmc, where ∆N is
the Uncertainity in the number of particles, N, in the universe. Also ∆x = R,
the radius of the universe where

(8)

the famous Eddington relationship. It should be stressed that the otherwise
emperical Eddington formula, arises quite naturally in a Brownian charac-
terisation of the universe as has been pointed out earlier (Cf.
for example
ref.[5]). Put simply (8) in the Random Walk equation
We now get, using (2),

∆N = √N

5

Substituting this in the time analogue of the second term of (7), we immedi-
ately get, T being the age of the universe,

T = √N τ

(9)

In the above analysis, including the Eddington formula (8), l and τ are the
Compton wavelength and Compton time of a typical elementary particle,
namely the pion. The equation for the age of the universe is also correctly
given above. Infact in the closely related model of ﬂuctuational cosmology
(Cf. for example ref.[29]) all of the Dirac large number coincidences as also
the mysterious Weinberg formula relating the mass of the pion to the Hubble
constant, follow as a consequence, and are not emperical. In this formulation,
in a nutshell, √N particles are ﬂuctuationally created within the time τ , so
that,

which leads to (9) (and (8)).
Next use of the well known formula, (M = Nm, M being the mass of the
universe, and m the pion mass)

gives on diﬀerentiation and use of (10) the Hubble law, with

(11) gives the supposedly mysterious and empirical Weinberg formula con-
necting the pion mass to the Hubble constant.
Using (11) we can deduce that there can be a cosmological constant Λ such
that,

Recent observations conﬁrm this ever expanding and possibly accelerating
feature of the universe[30]. All these relations relating large scale parameters
to microphysical constants were shown to be symptomatic of what has been
called, stochastic holism (Cf. also ref.[31]), that is a micro-macro connection
with a Brownian or stochastic underpinning. Duality, or equivalently, rela-
tion (7) is really an expression of this micro-macro link.

3 The Dirac and Feynman - Wheeler Formu-

lations

To appreciate this concept of holism in a more physical sense, we return to
the classical description of the electron alluded to right at the beginning. We
will discuss very brieﬂy the contributions of Dirac, Feynman and Wheeler.
This was built upon the earlier work of Lorentz, Abraham, Fokker and others.
Our starting point is the so called Lorentz-Dirac equation[2]:

maµ = F µ

ext + Γµ

(13)

where

and Γµ is the Abraham radiation reaction four vector related to the self force

Γµ =

Equation (12) is the relativistic generalisation for a point electron of an
earlier equation proposed by Lorentz, while equation (13) is the relativisitic
generalisation of the original radiation reaction term due to energy loss by
radiation. It must be mentioned that the mass m in equation (12) consists of
a neutral mass and the original electromagnetic mass of Lorentz, which latter
does tend to inﬁnity as the electron shrinks to a point, but, this is absorbed
into the neutral mass. Thus we have the forerunner of renormalisation in
quantum theory.
There are three unsatisfactory features of the Lorentz-Dirac equation (12).
Firstly the third derivative of the position coordinate in (12) through Γµ gives
a whole family of solutions. Except one, the rest of the solutions are run away
- that is the velocity of the electron increases with time to the velocity of
light, even in the absence of any forces. This energy can be thought to come
from the inﬁnite self energy we get when the size of the electron shrinks to
zero. If we assume adhoc an asymptotically vanishing acceleration then we
get a physically meaningful solution, though this leads to a second diﬃculty,
that of violation of causality of even the physically meaningful solutions. Let
us see this brieﬂy.

For this, we notice that equation (12) can be written in the form[2],

where τ denotes the time and R is the total radiation rate.
It can be seen that equation (14) diﬀers from the usual equation of Newtonian
Mechanics, in that it is non local in time. That is, the acceleration aµ(τ )
depends on the force not only at time τ , but at subsequent times also. Let
us now try to characterise this non locality in time. We observe that τ0 given
10−23secs. So equation (14) can be
by equation (15) is the Compton time
approximated by

∼

maµ(τ ) = K µ(τ + ξτ0)

K µ(τ )

≈

Thus as can be seen from (16), the Lorentz-Dirac equation diﬀers from the
usual local theory by a term of the order of

2
3

e2
c3 ˙aµ

τ0, the Compton time ex-

the so called Schott term.
So, the non locality in time is within intervals
actly what we encountered in section 2.
It must also be reiterated that the Lorentz-Dirac equation must be supple-
mented by the asymptotic condition of vanishing acceleration in order to be
meaningful. That is, we have to invoke not just the point electron, but also
distant regions into the future as boundary conditions.
Finally it must be borne in mind that the four vector Γµ given in (13) can
also be written as

In (18) we can see the presence of the advanced or acausal ﬁeld which has
been considered unsatisfactory. Infact this term, as is well known directly
leads to the Schott term (17). Let us examine this non local feature. As
is known, considering the time component of the Schott term (17) we get

that is of the order of the Compton wavelength. This follows in any case in a
relativistic theory, given the above Compton time. This term represents the
eﬀects within the neighbourhood of the charge.
What we have done is that we have quantiﬁed the space-time interval of
non locality - it is of the order of the Compton wavelength and time. This
contains the renormalization eﬀect and gives the correct physical mass.
We now come to the Feynman-Wheeler action at a distance theory[32, 33].
They showed that the apparent acausality of the theory would disappear if
the interaction of a charge with all other charges in the universe, such that
the remaining charges would absorb all local electromagnetic inﬂuences was
considered. The rationale behind this was that in an action at a distance
context, the motion of a charge would instantaneously aﬀect other charges,
whose motion in turn would instantaneously aﬀect the original charge. Thus
considering a small interval in the neighbourhood of the point charge, they
deduced,

The left side of (19) is the usual causal ﬁeld, while the right side has two
terms. The ﬁrst of these is the time symmetric ﬁeld while the second can
easily be identiﬁed with the Dirac ﬁeld above and represents the sum of
the responses of the remaining charges calculated in the vicinity of the said
charge.
From this point of view, the self force or in the earlier Kerr-Newman for-
mulation, eﬀects within the Compton scale, turns out to be the combined

reaction of the rest of the charges, or in the earlier duality and cosmological
considerations, the holistic eﬀect.

4 Duality and Scale

In a previous communication[34] it was shown that we could consider a scaled
Planck constant

such that we would have

It is interesting to note that these relations are essentially the same as the
second or extra term in (7) viz.,

with ∆p = √Nm and ∆x = R as before. This can be easily veriﬁed.
In other words the two terms of the modiﬁed Heisenberg Uncertainity relation
(7) represents two scales. The ﬁrst term represents the micro scale with the
Planck constant, while the second term represents the macro scale with the
scaled Planck constant h1, both being linked, as noted earlier.

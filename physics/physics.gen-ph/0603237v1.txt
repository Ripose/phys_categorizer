Abstract

The formalism of dynamics in the space-time, where motion of free par-
ticles is primordially stochastic,
is considered. The conventional dynamic
formalism, obtained for the space-time, where the motion of free particles is
primordially deterministic, seems to be unsuitable. The statistical ensemble
of stochastic (or deterministic) systems is considered to be the main object of
dynamics. At such an approach one can describe deterministic, stochastic and
quantum particles by means of the uniform technique. The quantum particle
is described as a stochastic particle, i.e. without a reference to the quan-
tum principles. Besides, by means of this technique one can describe classical
inviscid ﬂuid. There are four diﬀerent versions of the formalism. One of ver-
sions uses equations, which describes evolution of the labelling (Lagrangian
coordinates ξ) at ﬁxed initial conditions for the density ρ and the momentum
density p. These ﬁxed initial conditions enter in the evolution equations. A
nonuniqueness of irrotational ﬂow and the mismatch w = v
p/m between
the velocity v and the momentum density p appear at this description. The
mismatch w is determined by the ﬂuid vorticity and by some arbitrary pa-
rameter. Appearance of mismatch may be associated with the turbulence.
The united formalism is purely dynamic. Even describing stochastic systems,
it does not refer to probability and probabilistic structures.

1 Introduction

The classical mechanics and the inﬁnitesimal calculus had been created by Isaac
Newton in the 17th century practically simultaneously. The ordinary diﬀerential
equations were the principal tool of the classical mechanics. In the 18th and 19th
centuries the development of the classical mechanics was carried out by means of

1

modiﬁcation of dynamic equations, when they were applied to new dynamic sys-
tems. All this time the conception of the event space (space-time) retained to be
unchanged. In the Newtonian conception of the event space there are two indepen-
dent invariants: space and time.

In the beginning of the 20th century Albert Einstein had discovered, that the
dynamics may be developed not only by means of a modiﬁcation of dynamic equa-
tions. The dynamics may be developed also by a modiﬁcation of the event space.
A. Einstein suggested and carried out the ﬁrst two modiﬁcations of the event space.
In the ﬁrst modiﬁcation, known as the special relativity, two Newtonian invariants
(space and time) were replaced by one invariant – the space-time interval. After such
a replacement one may speak about the space-time and the space-time geometry.
The second modiﬁcation of the event space was produced by A.Einstein ten years
later. This modiﬁcation is known as the general relativity. According to the general
relativity the space-time geometry may be inhomogeneous, and this nonhomogeneity
depends on the matter distribution in the space-time.

In the thirties of the 20th century it was discovered that the free particles of small
mass move stochastically. The motion of free particles depends only on the space-
time properties. It meant that for the explanation of the observed stochasticity one
needs the next modiﬁcation of the event space. The necessary third modiﬁcation of
the space-time geometry were to look rather exotic. As far as the stochasticity was
diﬀerent for the particles of diﬀerent mass, the free motion of a particle must depend
on the particle mass, i.e. the particle mass is to be geometrized. In the framework
of the Riemannian geometry it was impossible. Besides, in the framework of the
classical mechanics the particle motion is deterministic. If we want to explain the
particle motion stochasticity by the space-time properties, we are to use such a
space-time geometry, where the free particle motion be primordially stochastic. In
the framework of the Riemannian geometry it was impossible. We did not know a
geometry with such properties.

In the beginning of the 20th century we had the alternative: either space-time
geometry with unusual exotic properties, or a refusal from the classical mechanics.
We had no adequate space-time geometry. The alternative was resolved in favour
of the quantum mechanics, which substituted the classical mechanics of the small
mass particles. At such a substitution the principles of the classical mechanics were
replaced by the quantum principles. Such a replacement of the classical principles
by the quantum principles was a very complicated procedure, which was produced
only for nonrelativistic phenomena.

The modiﬁcation of the space-time geometry is more attractive from logical view-
point, than the quantum mechanics, because it changes only space-time properties,
but does not change classical principles of dynamics, whereas the quantum mechan-
ics revises these principles. Unfortunately, the third modiﬁcation of the space-time
geometry was impossible in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century.

The new conception of geometry, which made possible the third modiﬁcation
of the space-time [1], appeared only in the end of the 20th century . The new
conception of geometry (known as T-geometry [2, 3, 4]) is very simple. It supposes

2

that any space-time geometry is described completely by the world function [5], and
then any space-time geometry can be obtained from the proper Euclidean geometry
by means of a deformation (replacement of the Euclidean world function σE with
the world function σ of the geometry in question in all deﬁnitions and relations of
the proper Euclidean geometry).

In the new (nondegenerate) space-time geometry the particle mass is geometrized,
the free particle motion is primordially stochastic, and the parallelism of vectors is
absolute and intransitive, in general. Besides, parameters of the space-time de-
pend on the quantum constant, and the statistical description of stochastic particles
motion is equivalent to the quantum description. A use of the nondegenerate space-
time geometry admits one to return to the classical mechanics of stochastic particles,
eliminating quantum principles.

In general, the inﬁnitesimal calculus, created for the Newtonian event space with
the deterministic particle motion, disagrees with the space-time conception, where
the free particle motion is primordially stochastic. One needs a new mathematical
tool, which be in accordance with the nondegenerate space-time geometry. Con-
struction of such a tool is a very diﬃcult problem, and we shall not try to solve it.
Instead, we take from the new space-time geometry only the property of stochastic
motion of free particles and try to use it in the conventional Riemannian space-time.
In the Riemannian space-time the natural motion of free particles is deterministic.
We try to formulate the conventional classical mechanics in such a form, where the
stochastic particle motion be natural, whereas the deterministic particle motion be
a special case of the stochastic motion, when the stochasticity vanishes.

Note that the conventional classical mechanics considers only deterministic par-
ticles, whose motion is described by dynamic equations (ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions). One considers only some special cases of stochastic motion, referring to
the probability theory in this consideration. The main object of the conventional
classical mechanics is a single deterministic particle
Sd. From viewpoint of the
conventional classical mechanics the deterministic particle (dynamic system) and
the stochastic particle (stochastic system) are conceptually diﬀerent objects. The
conceptual diﬀerence consists in the fact that there are dynamic equations for the dy-
namic system and there are no dynamic equations for the stochastic system. There
is not even a collective concept with respect to concept of dynamic system and that
of stochastic system.

If information on the deterministic particle

Sd is incomplete (for instance, if
the initial conditions are known approximately), there are diﬀerent versions of the
Sd motion. The particle motion is multiple-path. In this case we consider
particle
all these possible versions. One uses the statistical ensemble

words, we obtain a dynamic system.

Mathematically it looks as follows. We add some terms to the action (1.2). These
terms are chosen in such a way, to describe the quantum stochasticity, generated
by the properties of the space-time geometry. The supposed method of taking into
account of this stochasticity leads to the quantum description, which has been well
invstigated. The action is written in the form

of the stochastic velocity component. The third term describes interaction between

the velocity distribution and other more detailed characteristics of the stochastic

mation on the stochastic particle properties (investigation of the statistical ensemble
Sst] is insuﬃcient for this goal). Nevertheless, the information, which is obtained
[
E
from investigation of the statistical ensemble, appears to be valuable in many cases.
For instance, one can show [6] that by a proper change of variables the action (1.6) is
reduced to the action for the Schr¨odinger particle, i.e. to the action for the dynamic
system, described by the Schr¨odinger equation.

Thus, there is a general approach to a description of stochastic particles, when
the deterministic particle is considered to be a special case of stochastic particle
(with vanishing stochasticity). To realize this approach, we are to consider the
statistical ensemble
] as the primary object (basic object) of dynamics, whereas
E
the single system
is considered to be a derivative object of dynamics. Realizing
this approach, it is useful to introduce a collective concept with respect to concept
of dynamic system and that of stochastic system. We shall use the term ”physical
system”. We shall speak about the statistical ensemble

and it is of no importance, whether
is the dynamic system, or the stochastic one.
To stress that the dynamic system and the stochastic system are special cases of
the physical system, we shall use the term ”deterministic physical system” instead
of the term ”dynamic system” and the term ”stochastic physical system” instead
of the term ”stochastic system”. The fact that we can obtain dynamic equations

a formal criterion, which admits one to determine, whether the physical systems

It means that the statistical ensemble of independent stochastic particles is imi-
tated by the set of interacting deterministic particles. In other words, the character
of stochasticity is described by the form of interaction UB. Any reference to the
stochastic velocity distribution or to some other probability distribution is absent.
Inﬂuence of this distribution on the mean motion of the particles is described by
the form of interaction (1.22). The situation reminds the case of the gas dynamics,

8

where the action of the Maxwell velocity distribution on the gas motion is described
by the internal gas energy. Of course, such a description is not comprehensive, how-
ever, it is suﬃcient for a description of the mean motion of the stochastic particle.
As a result we obtain a purely dynamic description of the stochastic particle motion.
Equations for the ideal ﬂuid may be described in terms of the wave function [6].
Irrotational ﬂow of the ﬂuid (1.15) is described by the Schr¨odinger equation for the
free quantum particle. It means:

1. The statistical ensemble of free quantum nonrelativistic particles may be con-
sidered to be a statistical ensemble of stochastic particles, which is described
by the action (1.8).

2. The wave function is simply a method of the ideal ﬂuid description, but not a
speciﬁc quantum object, deﬁned by means of enigmatic quantum principles.

3. The quantum particles are stochastic particles, which may be described in
terms of dynamics of physical systems, where the basic object is the statistical
ensemble.

Thus, the dynamics of physical systems admits one to describe quantum eﬀects
without a reference to quantum principles, because the quantum particles, as well
as stochastic ones are objects of classical dynamics of physical systems. Description
of stochastic and quantum particles is the problem of the classical dynamics, where
the basic object of dynamics is the statistical ensemble.

which is an analog of nonrelativistic dynamic equation (1.14).

The principal diﬀerence between the nonrelativistic description (1.14) and the
relativistic description (2.13) is as follows. The nonrelativistic equation (1.14) does
not contain temporal derivatives, and the ﬁeld u is determined uniquely by its
source (the particle density ρ). The relativistic equation (2.13) contains temporal
derivatives, and the κ-ﬁeld uk = ¯hκk/m can exist without its source. The relativistic
κ-ﬁeld uk = ¯hκk/m can escape from its source. Besides, the κ-ﬁeld changes the
eﬀective particle mass, as one can see from the relations (2.5) or (2.7), (2.8). If κ2
is large enough, or ∂kκk < 0 and
is large enough, the eﬀective particle mass
may be imaginary. In this case the mean world line may turn in the time direction,
and this turn may appear to be connected with the pair production, or with the
pair annihilation.

In the nonrelativistic case the mean stochastic velocity u may be eliminated and
replaced by its source (the particle density ρ). In the relativistic case the κ-ﬁeld has

11

in addition its own degrees of freedom, which cannot be eliminated, replacing the
κ-ﬁeld by its source. The κ-ﬁeld can travel from one space-time region to another.
The uniform formalism of dynamics (with the statistical ensemble as a basic
object of dynamics) admits one to describe such a physical phenomena, which cannot
be described in the framework of the conventional dynamic formalism, when the
basic object is a dynamic system. In particular, one can describe the pair production
eﬀect, which cannot been described in the framework of the conventional relativistic
mechanics, as well as in the framework of the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.

4 Methods of the statistical ensemble description

We shall consider four diﬀerent methods of the statistical ensemble description:
(1) description in Lagrangian coordinates, (2) description in Eulerian coordinates,
(3) Hamilton-Jacobi description, (4) description in terms of the wave function. We
demonstrate application of these methods in the example of nonrelativistic stochastic
particle, moving in the given external potential V (x). In this case the action (1.6)
takes the form

Thus, in the Lagrangian variables t, ξ the dynamic equations for the statistical
ensemble of stochastic (quantum) particles are rather bulky. However, if the par-
ticles are deterministic, and ¯h = 0, dynamic equations (4.7) turn to the ordinary
diﬀerential equations

m¨x =

∇V (x) ,

x = x (t, ξ)

−

If in the dynamic equations (4.9) the variable x does not depend on ξ, they are
dynamic equations for the single classical particle. In order to pass from the equation
(4.9) for the single particle, described by x = x (t), to the dynamic equations (4.7),
i.e. ”to quantize the classical particle”, one needs to consider statistical ensemble
(replace x = x (t) by x = x (t, ξ)) and to add two last terms, containing the quantum
constant. Thus, the conventional quantization may be considered as some dynamic
procedure, introducing additional terms in the action of the statistical ensemble.
One needs no quantum principles for such a quantization, because the concept of
the wave function does not used here, (the quantum principles are needed only for
explanation, what is the wave function)

If the relation (1.16) takes place, and relations x = x (t, ξ) can be resolved with
respect to variables ξ in the form ξ = x (t, x), dynamic equations (4.9) can be
rewritten in the Eulerian variables in the form (1.19), (1.20)

where ρ = ρ (t, x), v = v (t, x). In the Eulerian coordinates the dynamic equations
for the statistical ensemble are simpler, than those in the Lagrangian coordinates.
At the same time they are rather demonstrable. To obtain the mean trajectories of
stochastic particles, one needs to solve at ﬁrst the dynamic equations (4.10), (4.11).
When the variables ρ = ρ (t, x), v = v (t, x) become known, one needs to solve
ordinary diﬀerential equations

has to be compatible with dynamic equations, because Lagrangian coordinates ξ
label the mean world lines. The demand of this compatibility may lead to such a
deﬁnition of the velocity v, which does not coincide with v = p/m

namic equation (4.43) is compatible with the ﬁrst relation (4.38) and with the re-
lation v = p/m, provided ω = 0. Appearance of the indeﬁnite quantity in the
dynamic equations (4.43) means that the solutions of hydrodynamic equations cease
to be unique in the case of irrotational ﬂow. For description of nonunique solutions
we separate the problem into two parts. We consider the solution with ω = 0, when
the velocity v = p/m. This solution is unique, and we refer to it as the skeleton so-
lution. Other solutions of hydrodynamic equations with the same initial conditions
will be derived from the skeleton solution. The procedure of the additional solutions
derivation depends only on the skeleton solution, but not on the method of its deriva-
tion. Such an approach seems to be rather reasonable. In the additonal solutions
the direction of momentum density p does not coincide with the direction of the
velocity v.

The variable Φ is the variable of action, and the equation (4.60) is the Hamilton

scribes the irrotational ﬂow of the ﬂuid. The system of dynamic equations (4.54) -
(4.56) may be considered as some generalization of the Hamilton - Jacobi equation
to the case of the rotational ﬂow.

Using equation (4.54), we can eliminate ∂0ξ from the equation (4.56). After

Thus, we have ﬁve dynamic equations (4.54), (4.55), (4.62) for determination of
ﬁve dynamic variables ϕ, ξ, ρ. These equations contains ﬁve indeﬁnite functions

determined from the initial values for hydrodynamic variables ρ, p, whereas the in-
deﬁnite quantity ω (t, ξ) cannot be determined uniquely. There are only constraints
(4.50), imposed on ω.

If we set ω = 0 in dynamic equations (4.54), (4.62), the system of equations
(4.54), (4.55), (4.62) forms the system of dynamic equations for determination
of the unique skeleton solution, provided the indeﬁnite functions ρ0 (ξ), g (ξ) =

Let us choose the initial form of labelling in the form

ξ (0, x) = ξin (x) = x,

ϕ (0, x) = ϕin (x) = 0

Setting t = 0 in (4.33), (4.18) and taking into account (5.1) and (5.2), we obtain
respectively

p (0, x) = pin (x) = b0g (x)

ρ (0, x) = ρin (x) = ρ0 (x)

∂ (ξin1 (x) , ξin2 (x) , ξin3 (x))

Thus, arbitrary functions g (ξ) and the weight function ρ0 (ξ) may be uniquely
determined via initial values ρin (x), pin (x) of quantities ρ, p.

The initial values ξin (x), ϕin (x) of hydrodynamic potentials ξ, ϕ may be chosen

dynamics.

6 Description in terms of complex potential

One may form complex potential ψ from the Clebsch potentials ξ, ϕ and the density
ρ. This complex potential ψ is known as the wave function, or ψ-function. By
means of a change of variables the action (4.37) can be transformed to a description
in terms of a wave function [6]. Let us introduce the k-component complex function

Dynamic equations (6.13) do not contain explicitly the indeﬁnite quantity ω,
leading to the nonuniqueness of the solution. Simultaneously the wave function ψ
is constructed of Clebsch potentials ξ by means of the relations (6.1), (6.3). Solving
dynamic equation (6.13) at some initial condition ψ (0, x) = ψin (x), may we be sure,
that we obtain the skeleton solution? Yes, we may be sure, because the momentum
density p, deﬁned by the second relation (6.4), is the same for all values of the
indeﬁnite quantity ω, whereas the velocity v is connected with p by means of the
relations (4.44), (4.48). These expressions contain the indeﬁnite quantity ω. To

7 Expressions for mismatch between momentum

and velocity

Expression for the momentum p in terms of the wave function is determined by the
relation (6.4). If the mismatch w between the velocity v and the momentum p is
absent, then the velocity v is deﬁned by the relation (6.14). The mismatch w is
deﬁned by the relations (4.44) with the constraint (4.47) imposed on the quantity
ω. In this section we try to express the mismatch w in terms of the wave function
ψ.

First of all, we note that the Lagrangian coordinates ξ =

may be
considered to be the system ˜K of curvilinear coordinates in the space, whereas the
Cartesian coordinates x =
are considered to be the coordinate system
K in the same space. The quantity Ωαβ (ξ) may be considered to be the vorticity

Thus, description in terms of the wave function ψ =

obtain some ”dynamic skeleton” of the ﬂow, i.e. we obtain the density ρ (t, x) and
the momentum density p (t, x), deﬁned by the relations (6.4). The total picture
of ﬂow, determined by the density ρ, momentum density p and velocity v cannot
be derived uniquely, because determination of the velocity v by means of relation
(4.44) contains indeﬁnite mismatch w and ω.

Dynamic equations, describing ”dynamic skeleton” are the same for any value of
mismatch w. In particular, if w = 0, the dynamic equations (7.10) describe ”dy-
namic skeleton”. They describe the ”dynamic skeleton” also in the case, when
w = v

p/m

= 0.

At the conventional approach to the Euler hydrodynamic equations, one consider
the problem of determination of ﬂuid particle trajectory as some triviality. If we
have solved the Euler equations (7.9) and have determined v = v (t, x), the problem
of determination of the stream lines is reduced to a solution of the system of ordinary
diﬀerential equations

dx
dt

= v (t, x)

(7.11)

This problem seems to be much simpler, than the problem of solution of the Euler
equations (7.9), and one does not consider the solution of the equation (7.11) as a
problem concerning the ﬂuid ﬂow determination.

8 Mismatch and the turbulence problem

The turbulent ﬂuid ﬂow is an irregular vortical ﬂow of an inviscid ﬂuid. As far as
we know, an exact mathematical deﬁnition of the turbulence is absent. Turbulent
ﬂow appears as a spontaneous vortical ﬂow. Numerous attempts to understand the
turbulence phenomenon and to describe it in terms of an inviscid or slightly viscid
ﬂuid failed.

Properties of the mismatch between the velocity and momentum are connected
closely with the ﬂuid vorticity. The mismatch (4.44) is proportional to the ﬂow
vorticity. If the ﬂow is irrotational the mismatch vanishes. The mismatch appears
at the consideration of the labelling evolution which is described by the equation
(4.41) and generates nontrivial solutions, depending on an indeﬁnite factor ω.

The variational problem with the action functional (4.1) deals with the dependent
variables x = x (t, ξ), describing dynamics with ﬁxed labelling. The variational
problem with the action functional (4.19) deals with the dependent variables ξ =
ξ (t, x), describing the labelling with ﬁxed dynamics. The two variational problems
are equivalent, provided that the Jacobian ∂J/∂ξ0,0, deﬁned by (4.18), does not
vanish. If in some points

∂J
∂ξ0,0 ≡

∂ (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)
∂ (x1, x2, x3)

= 0

(8.2)

we cannot be sure that the problems (4.1) and (4.19) are equivalent. In the irrota-
tional ﬂow, where labelling is rather simple, we can be sure that the condition (4.21)
takes place, and the two variational problems are equivalent. In the strongly vortical
ﬂow the labelling is rather entangled, and the condition (8.2) may be satisﬁed in
some points. Then the variational problems (4.1) and (4.19) may be not equivalent.
But what of the two variational problems is more general and primary? Appar-
ently, the variational problem (4.19) is more general and primary, because it admits
solutions with an nonvanishing mismatch. It is not clear, whether the variational
problem (4.1) admits solutions with the nonvanishing mismatch, because in this case
dynamic equations (4.7) are too complicated for investigation of their uniqueness.

One may suggest, that the turbulence problem is in reality the problem of the
mismatch, or the two problems are connected . There are several arguments in favour
of this suggestion. First, both problems are connected with the ﬂow vorticity. Both
problems disappear for the irrotational ﬂows. Second, the problem of mismatch is the
problem of the labelling, but not that of dynamics. If we suppose that the turbulence
problem is also the problem of labelling, the failure of the turbulence investigation
becomes clear. One tried to investigate the turbulence, studying dynamic equations
(7.9), which describe only dynamics, but not the labelling.

The problem of labelling is a natural problem of the statistical description. Let
us consider a simple example. Two ﬂows of identical particles pass one through
another without interaction (See ﬁgure 1). Dashed lines show real trajectories of
particles. The solid lines show trajectories of the mean particle motion, i.e. lines of
constant labelling, by means of Lagrangian coordinates ξ. We see that the two sorts
of lines do not coincide in the region, where two diﬀerent ﬂows pass one through
If directions of two
another. We observe so-called reconnection of trajectories.
colliding beams are close, the reconnection will be slight, and it may be described
by such an eﬀect as mismatch. Thus, at the statistical description the mean world
lines of particles are labelled, and the mean world lines may not coincide, in general,
with the real world lines even in the case of deterministic particles.

As far as the statistical ensemble is the principal object of dynamics, where we
deal only with the mean motion, the problem of labelling and problem of mismatch
appear to be an important side of dynamics.

Let us consider a simple example, when the skeleton picture of irrotational ﬂow is
determined and described by the ﬁeld of the momentum p. Let the skeleton velocity
V = p/m, associated with the momentum density, be directed along the z-axis. In
the cylindrical coordinate system r, ϕ, z we have

Vr = 0,

9 Concluding remarks

In this paper we try to construct the uniform formalism for description of physical
(stochastic and deterministic) systems. We use the statistical ensemble as a ba-
sic object of dynamics, using the fact that the statistical ensemble is a continuous
dynamic system independently of whether its elements are stochastic or dynamic
systems. Such an approach admits one to describe quantum systems, consider-
ing them as stochastic system and using only principles of classical (not quantum)
physics at this description. Besides, the developed technique may be applied for
description of classical inviscid ﬂuids.

We considered four diﬀerent methods of the statistical ensemble description.
Three of them describe only ”dynamic skeleton” of the statistical ensemble ﬂow
and ignore the problem of mismatch between the velocity and momentum. The
method description in terms of hydrodynamic potentials ϕ, ξ is a method of the
labelling description, with the ﬁxed ”dynamic skeleton”. By means of this method
one succeeded to discover the mismatch between the velocity and momentum density
and to formulate constraints imposed on the mismatch w. The whole picture of the
ﬂow is obtained after determination of the mismatch and its imposition on the
”dynamic skeleton”. The ”dynamic skeleton” is a description of the density ρ and
the momentum density p as functions of the independent variables t, x. The total
picture of the ﬂow appears after additional determination of the mean velocity v
as a function of the independent variables t, x. Now there is no prescriptions for
determination of the mismatch between the velocity v and the momentum density
p. However, it is important, that the determination of mismatch is separated in
the special problem, which is not connected directly with the dynamic equations (at
any rate, this connection is not clear now). The nonvanishing mismatch does not
appear at irrotational ﬂow, and there are some indications to a connection of the
mismatch with the turbulence problem.

In the Minkowski space-time geometry the mismatch between the momentum p
and velocity v looks rather exotic and unusual. In the real space-time geometry,
where the motion of free particles is primordially stochastic, such a mismatch be-
tween two parallel vectors is a rule. The fact is that, there are many vectors −−→P0P1,
which have the common origin P0, and are parallel to the given vector −−→P0Q. Here
P0 and Q are respectively the space-time points, which describe the origin and the
of vectors −−→P0P1, which are parallel to the
end of the given vector −−→P0Q. The set
S
vector −−→P0Q, form a cone with the vertex at the point P0. The vectors of the set
S
are parallel to the vector −−→P0Q, but they are not parallel between themselves. (see
details in [4]). Existence of many parallel vectors, which are not parallel between
themselves (intransitivity of parallelism) is a reason of the quantum stochasticity.
Thus, existence of mismatch between the momentum p and velocity v, which must
be parallel in the real space-time (and not parallel in the Minkowski space-time) is
generated by concept of the parallelism in itself. Only one thing seems to be strange
and unclear. We consider dynamics in the Minkowski space-time, taking from the
real space-time only existence of stochasticity. Nevertheless, we obtain absence of

30

the conventional parallelism in addition to the assumed stochasticity.

ance of two connected objects: single physical system

A use of the statistical ensemble as a basic object of dynamics leads to appear-
and statistical ensemble
]. The mathematical formalism uses only statistical ensemble, or the statisti-
E
cal average system
. However, there are two kinds of measurements: (1) single
measurement (S-measurement), which is produced over a single physical system
, (2) the massive measurement (M-measurement), which is produced over many
S
systems of the statistical ensemble. The S-measurement and the M-measurement
have diﬀerent properties. They are not to be mixed, because it leads to the logical
contradictions and paradoxes. (see details in [8]).

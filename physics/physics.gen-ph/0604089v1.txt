A detailed study is made of the space-time transformation properties of inter-
charge forces and the associated electric and magnetic force ﬁelds, both in classical
electrodynamics and in a recently developed relativistic classical electrodynamical
theory. Important diﬀerences are found and serious errors are found in the tradi-
tional treatment of special-relativistic eﬀects in classical electromagnetism. Fields
associated with radiation processes are also considered and classical and quantum
mechanical predictions are compared. An important, though trivial, mathemati-
cal error in the derivation of the retarded Li´enard-Wiechert retarded potentials is
pointed out. It is also shown why electric and magnetic ﬁelds produced my moving
source charges or current distributions are not ‘classical ﬁelds’, and that they do not,
in general, constitute an antisymmetic second-rank tensor, as is usually assumed.

In a recent paper by the present author [1], the mechanical aspects of classical elec-
trodynamics, that is the description of the forces between electric charges with arbitary
relative motion, was developed from the three postulates:

Introduction

(i) Coulomb’s Law

(ii) Special relativistic invariance

(iii) Hamilton’s Principle

The forces between two charges of magnitude q1, q2 are derived from the manifestly
Lorentz invariant Lagrangian:

where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Here the space-time positions of the charges are
speciﬁed by the 4-vectors x1, x2. u1 and u2 are the 4-vector velocities of the charges and j1
and j2 their 4-vector electromagnetic currents, q1u1 and q2u2, respectively. In accordance
with quantum electrodynamics [1], the interaction between the charges is instantaneous1:

The non-retarded nature of electric [2] and magnetic [3] force ﬁelds and their consistency
with instantaneous action-at-a-distance has recently been experimentally demonstrated.
Inserting the Lagrangian (1.1) into the covariant Lagrange equations yields the ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential equations that describe the motion of the charges:

Equations (1.2) and (1.3) provide a complete description of the classical relativistic dy-
namics of two isolated charges undergoing mutual electromagnetic interaction. They
contain however no ‘ﬁelds’ and the force-ﬁeld concept was not used in their derivation. It
is evidently of interest, however, to compare the forces given by the right sides of (1.2)
and (1.3) with those generated by the force ﬁelds of conventional classical electromag-
netism, referred to in the following, for brevity, as CEM. The latter is described in detail

1A time-like metric is employed for 4-vector products

in many text books, for example, the well-known ones of Landau and Lifshitz [4] and
Jackson [5]. The ﬁrst four sections of the present paper are then mainly devoted to a
detailed comparison of the predictions of (1.2) and (1.3), referred to below as RCED, for
‘Relativistic Classical Electro-Dynamics’, with the conventional CEM predictions. It is
pointed out that, contrary to the usual assumption, neither the 4-vector potential, nor
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are ‘classical ﬁelds’ in the sense explained in Section 3. In
Section 4 it is demonstrated that that longitudinal ﬁelds of a uniformly moving charge are
not covariant, and that CEM ﬁelds do not obey the electric ﬁeld divergence equation or
the electrodynamic Maxwell equation (Amp`ere’s law). A corollary is that, as previously
pointed out, the electric ﬁeld of a moving charge does not obey Gauss’ law [6].

It has previously been remarked that, when terms of O(β2) and higher are taken
into account, the predictions of CEM and RCED are not the same.
In particular, it
has been shown that the electric ﬁeld of a uniformly moving charge given by the Heav-
iside formula [7], gives inconsistent results for Rutherford scattering in diﬀerent inertial
frames [6]. The ﬁelds of an accelerated charge derived from ‘retarded’ Li´enard Wiechert
(LW) potentials [9], as used in the derivation of the Heaviside formula, are found to be,
unlike the RCED forces, incompatible with the existence of stable, circular, Keplerian
orbits [6]. Jackson’s ‘Torque Paradox’ [10] where application of a Lorentz transforma-
tion apparently induces a torque on two equal, mutually interacting, electric charges, and
which is a consequence of the use of the Heaviside formula and the associated magnetic
ﬁeld, is resolved [6] by the use of (1.2) and (1.3). No torque is produced by the RCED
forces. More recently it has been demonstrated that use of the Heaviside formula predicts
the complete absence of electromagnetic induction in a frame where a magnet is in motion
and the test charge is at rest [11]. In contrast, consistent results are found in frames where
a magnet is in motion, or at rest, by use of (1.2) and (1.3).

In Section 5 radiation ﬁelds are considered. They are obtained, in the conventional
manner, as solutions of inhomogeneous d’Alembert equations derived by combining the
electrodynamic Maxwell Equation with the Lorenz condition2 for the 4-vector potential.
The retarded solutions proportional to 1/r2 are found to diﬀer from the conventional ones
derived from the LW potentials, but to agree, up to a common factor and a retarded time
argument, with the CEM force ﬁelds corresponding to (1.2) and (1.3). The diﬀerence is
shown to result from an incorrect inversion of the order of spatial and temporal integra-
tions in deriving the LW potentials. Thus the standard CEM force ﬁelds are incorrect,
ﬁrstly because they are assumed to be retarded rather than instantaneous and secondly
because there is a mathematical error in their derivation. The retarded solutions of the
d’Alembert equations, proportional to 1/r, describing radiative eﬀects (the creation and
propagation of real photons) are discusseed for the case of dipole radiation in the far zone
and shown to be equivalent, in the limit of low photon densities, with quantum mechani-
cal predictions, in the non-relativistic limit, for a static dipole source. However radiative
eﬀects in a boosted frame with β
1 are found to be not correctly described by the
Poynting vector of the transformed radiation ﬁelds in this frame.

Section 6 contains a summary and outlook. Because of the length of the paper, the
reader is encouraged to read this section ﬁrst, in order to obtain an overview of the
material presented, and to return later to the previous sections for further information

In the following, one charge of magnitude Q will be considered as the ‘source’ of the
force ~F that is exerted on the ’test charge’ of magnitude q. In this section the relation

3

between the values of ~F found in diﬀerent frames will be analysed. For this, it will be
convenient to introduce the three inertial frames shown in Fig.1. In the frame S∗ (Fig.1a)
the source charge is at rest and the test charge moves with speed w parallel to the +ve
x-axis. In the frame S (Fig.1b) both charges are in motion parallel to the +ve x-axis, Q
with speed u, q with speed v. Finally in S’(Fig.1c), the test charge is at rest while the
source charge moves with speed w along the -ve x-axis. With the deﬁnitions:

w, u and v are related by the parallel velocity addition formula:

Introducing unit vectors ˆı, ˆ, ˆk along the x-, y- and z-axis directions and the angle ψ
between the radius vector joining the source and test charges and the +ve x-axis, the
force ~F = d~p/dt on the test charge in the diﬀerent frames shown in Fig.1 is given by
Eqn(1.2) as3:

In these equations the Lorentz invariant character of the spatial separation of the charges,
mentioned above, which is also derived, from ﬁrst principles,4 from special relativity, in
Section 3 below, is taken into account. Thus r∗ = r = r′ and ψ∗ = ψ = ψ′. In all cases the
force vector lies in the x-y plane, but it is radial only in rest frame of the source charge. As
shown in Ref. [6], the non-radial behaviour of the force in S’ implies a similar behaviour
of the corresponding electric ﬁeld which therefore does not obey Gauss’ theorem.

Inspection of (2.5) resolves immediately Jackson’s ‘Torque Paradox’ [10]. In this case a
comparison is made of the conﬁguration in Fig.1a when w = 0 with that in Fig.1b when
v = u. Eqn(2.2) shows that the force is radial in S*. If w = 0 and v = u Eqn(2.5) gives

Note that in the case of the CEM formulae the possibility of diﬀerent spatial and angular
coordinates in the diﬀerent reference frames is left open even though, as will be shown in
the following section, the correct application of special relativity requires that r∗ = r = r′
and ψ∗ = ψ = ψ′, in Fig.1. This point will be returned to below when the conventional
text-book relativistic interpretation of (3.16)-(3.18) is discussed.

Comparison of (3.13)-(3.15) with (3.16)-(3.18) shows that some of the transformation
laws of the RCED and CEM ﬁelds are, apparently, quite diﬀerent. To investigate this
further it is instructive to rederive the transformation laws from the deﬁning equations
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in terms of the electromagnetic 4-vector potential

The transformation equations of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds will then be determined,
via Eqn(3.21), by those of the diﬀerential operators ∂α. These may be determined from
the inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformations:

by making some deﬁnite hypothesis about the functional space and time dependence of
the components of Aα [13]. Let F now denote any component of Aα. If it is assumed that
F is analogous to a classical ﬁeld, such as those describing the distribution of velocities
in a ﬂuid or the temperature at some point ~x in a solid body at time t, the functional
dependence on space and time is simply F = F (~x, t) where x, y z and t are considered
to be independent variables. In this case, the variation of F corresponding to changes in
these variables is given by the chain rule of diﬀerential calculus:

The relation between the diﬀerential operators ∂α and ∂′α, when operating on F , is readily
found by using the inverses of (3.29)-(3.31) to eliminate d~x and dt in the second member
of Eqn(3.32) in favour of d~x′ and dt′. Collecting terms, equating the coeﬃcients of the
components of d~x′ and of dt′ in the second and third members of (3.32), and noting

(3.32)

that the ﬁeld F is arbitary, gives the following transformation laws for the diﬀerential

where, again, the last equation in (3.13) or (3.16) has been used, in agreement with (3.43).

There is, however, a clear contradiction between the transformation law (3.41) of
Ex and that of the RCED ﬁeld in (3.15). Whether or not, and on the basis of what
assumptions, the CEM transformation equations (3.16)-(3.18) are consistent with (3.41)-
(3.43) will be discussed at the end of the present section after ﬁrst explaining the reasons
for the diﬀerence between (3.41) and the transformation law of the RCED Ex ﬁeld, in the
ﬁrst of equations (3.15).

The essential assumption, leading to the tensor character of F αβ, deﬁned in (3.36)-
(3.40), is that the components of A are ﬁelds, F , with space-time functional dependence
F = F (~x, t) where ~x is the spatial position at which the ﬁeld is speciﬁed and x, y, z and t
are independent variables. From this follows the correctness of the chain-rule (3.32), and
the consequent 4-vector transformation laws (3.33)-(3.35) of ∂α. Because these laws are

9

the same as those of Aα, F αβ has the transformation law (3.36), of which Eqn(3.41) is a
necessary consequence. The obvious question to ask is, whether the components of A are
indeed Classical Fields (CF) in the sense described above? The 4-vector potental, A, of a
charge in uniform motion in the frame S is given by the following formulae in RCED [1]
and CEM [16]:

The RCED and CEM force ﬁelds in (3.5)-(3.8) are derived from these potentials, and the
deﬁnitions (3.19) and (3.20), in Appendix A. The retarded Li´enard-Wiechert potentials [9]
of CEM are here expressed in their ‘present position’ form, so that r in all the equations
(3.49) to (3.52) is the instantaneous separation of the source and test charges at the
instant at which the potentials are evaluated. Two important remarks are now in order:

(i) the components of A are not classical ﬁelds in either RCED or CEM.

(ii) Unlike for RCED, the 4-vector character of the CEM potential is not evident from

inspection of Eqns(3.51) and (3.52).

In connection with point (i), all the components of A in both RCED and CEM have

a similar space-time and source-velocity dependence:

F = F (~xq, ~xQ(t), βu(t)) = F (

, βu(t))

(RCED)

= F (

~xq −

, sin ψ, βu(t))

|

~xQ(t)

(CEM)

which is evidently not that of a classical ﬁeld:

F CF = F (~xq, t).

It follows that the chain rule of (3.32), as well as the subsequently derived transformation
equations (3.33) and (3.34) are of general validity in neither RCED nor CEM. In fact the
time dependence is, in both cases, implicitly included, for the frames S and S’, in that of
~xQ. Since only uniform velocities are considered in the present section, βu is constant, so
all time dependence arises from that of ~xQ. Only in the frame S∗, where ~xQ is also constant
and ~A vanishes, does the 4-vector potential have the space time functional dependence,
(3.56), of a classical ﬁeld.

The space-time transformation properties of A, given the deﬁnitions (3.49)-(3.52), are
evidently determined by those of ~xq and ~xQ, from which those of the essential parameters

10

r in RCED, and r and sin ψ in CEM, may be determined. As shown in Ref [1] for RCED,
and as will be proved below for both RCED and CEM, r is a Lorentz invariant. This
follows in RCED directly from the instantaneous nature of the inter-charge force predicted
by QED. However, as will now be demonstrated, r must also be a Lorentz scalar in the
‘present position’ form (3.51) and (5.52) of the CEM potentials. Thus in Fig.1, the spatial
separation of the source and test charges as well as the angular position of the test charge
must be the same in all three reference frames. That this must be so, as a consquence
of special relativity alone, independently of whether the interaction is instantaneous or
retarded, will now be demonstrated.

For this it is convenient, as done in Ref [1], to locate the origin of all coordinate systems
specifying the positions of the test and source charges at the position of their centre of
energy (CE). Assuming, for simplicity, that the masses of the charges are equal, then
in the centre-of-mass (CM) system corresponding to the spatial conﬁgurations shown in
Fig.1, q has velocity ~vCM
(see Fig.2a). The motions
of the CE and the source and test charges in the frames S∗, S and S’ are shown in Fig.2b,
2c and 2d respectively. The following velocities are deﬁned: ~vCM
CE, ~vCE and
~v′
CE. These velocities have the generic form vF
i where F denotes a frame5 and i either a
charge or the centre of energy of the charges. A similar notation is used for the space and
time coordinates in Eqns(3.60) and (3.61). These velocities satisfy the relations:

The spatial separation of the source and test charges, in the diﬀerent frames, is given by
the moduli of the vectors:

The CE has, in each frame, spatial coordinates (0,0,0) and a time coordinate that, in
general, may be diﬀerent in the diﬀerent frames. Consider now arbitary events on the
world lines of the CE, the test charge, and the source charge respectively, in the frame
S : (tCE;0,0,0), (tq;~xq) and (tQ;~xQ). The corresponding events, in the other frames, are
related to those in S, and to each other, via the space-like Lorentz-invariant intervals sq,CE

Now it is clear by inspection of Fig.2 that since, in all cases, the charges and centre of

Because of the space-time functional dependence of each component of A in Eqns(3.54)

be used the derive the transformation (3.34) of the time derivative. Instead, it follows

It remains to discuss the consistency, or otherwise, of the transformation laws of
the CEM ﬁelds, in (3.16)-(3.18), with those of the RCED ﬁelds in (3.13)-(3.15) just
considered, and those of the second rank tensor F αβ in (3.41)-(3.43). The standard
text book treatment, which claims consistency between (3.16)-(3.18) and (3.41)-(3.43)
will ﬁrst be recalled, and then shown to be based on an incorrect application of special
relativity.
In the following, for deﬁnitness, the presentation in Jackson’s book [14] is
closely followed. Similar reasoning may be found in many other text books on classical
electromagnetism [15, 16, 17]. In the notation of the present paper, the ﬁeld point (or
the position of the test charge q) is at rest at the origin of S’ while the source charge is
at rest at the orgin of the S∗ frame. The space and time coordinates in both S’ and S∗
are considered. At t′ = t∗ = 0 the test and source charge have the same x-coordinate in
both frames: x′ = x∗ = 0. At the later times t′, t∗ they therefore have an x-separations
of ∆x′
Q = wt∗ in S∗. Three relativistic ans¨atze
x∗
x∗

are then introduced [14]. The ﬁrst step is to apply the Lorentz transformation of time
between S’ and S∗ to the space-time coordinates of the test charge:

Q = wt′ in S’, and ∆x∗

(3.90)

(3.91)

t∗ = γw(t′ +

t∗ = γwt′ A1

∆x′ = wt′ A2

Since x′

q = 0 at all times this gives the ﬁrst ansatz A1 6:

The second and third ans¨atze, A2, and A3 are the relations giving the separation of the
source and test charge in S’ and S∗ repectively:

∆x∗ = wt∗ A3
(3.92)
where it is assumed that t′ and t∗ are related by (3.90). Combining (3.90), (3.91) and
(3.92) leads to the relation:

∆x∗ = wt∗ = γwwt′ = γw∆x′

(3.93)

Thus the magnitude of the x-interval between the charges is found to be contracted by
the factor 1/γw in the S’ frame. This last equation is now used to relate r′ to r∗:

and (3.95) together with the second equation in (3.17) give:

in agreement both with the RCED transformation in Eqns(3.14) and the tensor transfor-
mation (3.42)7.

The three ans¨atze A1 (Eqn(3.90)) and A2 (Eqn(3.91)) and A3 (Eqn(3.92)), on which
the conventional analysis of the transformation properties of the CEM ﬁelds is based,
are now critically examined. Their combination leads to the relation (3.94) which is
in contradiction with the Lorentz scalar nature, r∗ = r′, of the intercharge separation
derived above. The crucial point is that no distinction is made between the ‘frame time’
(i.e.
that registered by all synchronised clocks at rest in the frame, at any instant),
with the apparent times of clocks when viewed by an observer in motion relative to the
proper frames of the clocks. Only the frame times t′ and t∗ are relevant for the relations
∆x′ = wt′ and ∆x∗ = wt∗. In fact, the transformation equation (3.89) (and its inverse)
relate not two frame times , but rather, in each case, a frame time to an apparent time.
To understand the actual physical meaning of Eqn(3.90) it is instructive to apply (3.89)
wt′ (see
to the source rather than the test charge. Making use of the relation x′
Fig.1c)) it is found that:

t′ = γw(t∗)app
(3.99)
where (t∗)app is the apparent time of a clock moving together with the source charge as
viewed by an observer at rest in S’. In a similar way, the inverse of (3.89):

Q =

−

t′ = γw(t∗

−

t∗ = γw(t′)app

can be used to calculate the apparent time of a clock moving together with the test charge
q = wt∗ (see Fig.1a) and (3.100)
as viewed by an observer at rest in S∗. In this case x∗
gives:

Both (3.99) and (3.101) are examples of the well-known time dilatation eﬀect. In (3.99) a
moving clock with S∗ as proper frame is viewed from S’ In (3.101) a moving clock with S’
as proper frame is viewed from S∗. Comparing now (3.101) with (3.90) it is clear that if
t∗ in (3.90) and (3.92) is the frame time in S∗ then t′ in (3.90) is not the frame time in S’

but rather the apparent time (t′)app of a clock at rest in S’ as viewed from S∗. Thus the
ansatz A1 is false, if the value of t′ in it is identiﬁed with the frame time in the correct
ansatz A2. Thus although A2 and A3 correctly deﬁne the relations between ∆x′, t′ and
∆x∗, t∗, respectively, A1 relates an apparent time to a frame time, not the two frame
times. This means that, although the ﬁrst member of Eqn(3.93) is correct, the last one,
derived by combining all three ans¨atze, is not.

Indeed, if instead of making the substitution (t′)app

t∗ is made in (3.99) the relation t′ = γwt∗ is obtained instead of
the substitution (t∗)app
(3.90). Combining with (3.92) then leads to the relation ∆x′ = γw∆x∗ instead of (3.93),
so that the x-interval is elongated rather than contracted in the frame S’. Because of the
evident spatial symmetry of the source and test charges this derivation is on exactly the
same logical footing (and equally false!) as the derivation of (3.93).

→

Since, in fact, no observations of moving clocks are performed in the problem presently
under discussion the time transformation equation (3.89) has, in any case, no relevance
to the discussion. What is important are the spatial separations of the charges at corre-
sponding instants in the two reference frames. This will now be considered.

In order to discuss the time dependence of the separation of the charges in the frames
S’ and S∗ it is convenient to consider the simpler case where ψ′ = ψ∗ = 0. In this case,
as shown in Fig.3a, the source and test charges coincide spatially when t′ = t∗ = 0. To
specify, in a rigorous manner, the spatial positions of the charges, rulers of length L are
laid along the x∗ and x’ axis so that the right end of the ruler at rest in S’ (the S’ ruler)
coincides with the position of the test charge at x′ = 0. The left end of the ruler at
rest in S∗ (the S∗ ruler) coincides with the position of the source charge at x∗ = 0. The
conﬁguration in S’ at t′ = t∗ = 0 is shown in Fig.3a. Observers at rest in S’ or S∗ ( S’,
S∗ observers) then use the corresponding rulers to specify the positions of the moving
charges: the source charge Q in S’ and the test charge q in S∗, respectively. Note that the
moving ruler in Fig.3a is of length L i.e. this is its measured length in S’ at all times. Such
a ruler may be constructed by deﬁning the marks as the positions of several small discrete
objects initially at rest with known separations. Each ‘mark object’ is then accelerated
in an identical manner to constitute the moving ruler of known ﬁxed length. Of course,
because of the identical natures of the acceleration programs of each mark object, the
length of such a ruler, in its own proper frame, whether this is accelerated or inertial, is
independent of time.

Suppose now that the ﬁelds are to be evaluated at the instant that Q is in spatial
concidence with the 5th mark on the S’ ruler (see Fig.3b). It is clear, in this case, that
∆x′ = L/2. Also, since the 5th mark of the moving S∗ ruler is distant L/2 from Q at all
times, it follows that q and the 5th mark of the S∗ ruler are in spatial coincidence at the
same instant as Q and the 5th mark of the S’ ruler. Inspection of Fig.3c shows that the
same spatial coincidences are simultaneous also in S∗.

With the choice w = (√3/2)c, γw = 2. According to Eqn(2.92) following from the
ansatz A1, t∗ = 2t′ so that when t′ = L/(2w) as in Fig.2b, it is claimed that the corre-
sponding conﬁguration in S∗ is that shown in Fig.3e, where ∆x∗ = L and q is in spatial
coincidence with the right end of the S∗ ruler. Now Eqn(3.93) states that the conﬁgura-
tions shown in Fig3b and 3e are corresponding ones, i.e. both correspond to the instant

the left hand end of the S’ ruler, ∆t′ = L/w and ∆x′ = L = ∆x∗.

In conclusion, the ans¨atze A1, A2 and A3 do not describe correctly the time evolution
of the intercharge separation, as shown in Fig.3, where only the reciprocity of the relative
velocities of S∗ and S’, together with the deﬁnition itself of uniform velocity, are assumed.
In fact, special relativity has no possible relevance to the time evolution of the intercharge
separation illustrated in Fig.3, in which the conﬁgurations are viewed only either in S∗ or
in S’.

In fact the connection between the frames S∗ and S in Fig.3 uses only the principle
of what may be termed the ‘universality of space-time contiguity’ (USTC) which states
that:

Two events which are in space-time contiguity in one inertial frame

are so in all such frames.

Suppose A and B are contiguous in the CM frame, i.e. ~xCM

A = tCM
B .
Choosing a coordinate system where xCM
A = 0 implies that the correspond-
ing coordinates in any other inertial frame are given as ˜xA and ˜tA by Eqns(3.62)-(3.65).
It is then found that

A = 0 when tCM

A = ~xCM

and tCM

B

˜xA = xCM

A = 0 = xCM

B = ˜xB,

˜tA = tCM

A = 0 = tCM

B = ˜tB

A

and ˜zA = zCM

while ˜yA = yCM
since these components are unchanged by Lorentz trans-
formation. Hence the events are contiguous in the arbitary inertial frame with coordinates
˜x, ˜y, ˜z and ˜t. A special case of this principle ‘Source-Signal Contiguity’ (SSC) states the
contiguity of a photon emission event with a point on the world line of its source [18].

A

It is clear, by inspection, that Fig.3b and Fig.3c respect USTC whereas Fig.3b and
Fig.3e, which are claimed in the derivation of (3.93) to be corresponding views of the
same events in the frames S’ and S∗ respectively, do not.
In Fig.3b q is aligned with
the 5th mark of the S∗ ruler. In Fig.3e it is aligned with the 10th mark. In the correct
corresponding S∗ conﬁguration, shown in Fig.3b, q is aligned (as in S’) with the 5th mark
of the S∗ ruler in agreement with USTC.

Substituting now the correct values of ˜r and ˜ψ from (3.77) into (3.17) leads to the

transformation laws of the CEM ﬁelds;

in contradiction to both the transformation laws of the RCED ﬁeld and those, Eqns(3.41)
and (3.42), of a classical ﬁeld transforming as a second rank tensor.

It may be remarked that the agreement between the transformation laws of Ey and
Bz ((3.42) and (3.43) for classical ﬁelds, (3.46) and (3.48) for RCED ﬁelds) is related to

19

the absence of x-derivatives in the calculations of Ey and Bz from A. The transformation
laws ∂ /∂y = ∂ /∂y′ and ∂ /∂z = ∂ /∂z′ are valid for classical, RCED and CEM ﬁelds.

Finally in this section the transformation laws the electromagnetic potential in RCED

and CEM are discussed. Since r = r∗ Eqns(3.49)-(3.52) may be written as:

In this case A(CEM) transforms as a 4-vector. However, as explained above, the anstatz

In conclusion the ‘present position’ retarded
Li´enard-Wiechert potentials (3.51) and (3.52), unlike the RCED ones (3.49) and (3.50),
do not constitute a 4-vector.

4 Breakdown of the electrodynamic Maxwell equa-
tions in free space for the force ﬁelds of RCED

Maxwell’s equations played a very important role in the development of the theory of
special relativity. The possibility of the non-absolute character of time was suggested by
the space and time transformations introduced by Voigt [22] 9 in order to leave invariant,
in diﬀerent inertial frames, the electromagnetic wave equation. The space-time Lorentz
transformation 10 was originally obtained from the requirement that Maxwell’s equations

8Since A is here deﬁned in the frame S, not S’, it is necessary to make the replacements w

u and

→
9The Voigt transformation diﬀers from the Lorentz transformation of Eqns(3.62)-(3.65) by an overall

multiplicative factor 1/˜γ on the right sides of the equations.

10The Lorentz transformation (3.62)-(3.65) was given and so-baptised by Poincar´e in 1905 [23], the same
year it was derived by Einstein [24] from the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light. Lorentz’s
last pre-relativity paper, published in 1904, [25], contained somewhat diﬀerent space-time transformation
equations, from which (3.62)-(3.65) are obtained by the substitution x
In this paper the
proposed electric and magnetic ﬁeld transformations are the same as in Eqns(3.41)-(3.43).

should remain invariant under this transformation. As will be recalled below, this also
requires that electric and magnetic ﬁelds transform according to Eqn(3.36), that is, as
classical ﬁelds that are components of a second rank tensor. The equation for ‘electro-
magnetic waves’ may be derived by combining three of the free space Maxwell equations.
The invariance of this wave equation for diﬀerent inertial frames shows that the speed, c,
of the ‘waves’ is the same in all inertial frames. This was the great triumph of Maxwell’s
electromagnetic ﬁeld theory. It was clearly the primary motivation for Einstein to promote
the constancy of the speed of light (which was identiﬁed with that of the ‘electromagnetic
waves’) to the status of a fundamental postulate on which the theory of relativity was
based. Indeed, since the relativity principle itself is equally valid in Newtonian physics, it
is this second postulate of Einstein which diﬀerentiates special from Galilean relativity.

The above account describes the historical development of the subject as recounted
in text books on classical electrodynamics and special relativity. However, there is a
very serious inconsistency in this line of argument. Although it has, until now, been
universally assumed that the force ﬁelds of classical electrodynamics discussed in the pre-
vious section do satisfy Maxwell’s equations, they are manifestly not classical ﬁelds with
space-time functional dependence F CF = F (~xq, t) where xq, yq, zq and t are indepen-
dent variables. In fact, the components of electric and magnetic ﬁelds have a space-time
functional dependence similar to a component the corresponding 4-vector potentials as
given in (3.54) for RCED and (3.55) for CEM. As will be shown below, a consequence of
this is that, although the Faraday-Lenz law and the magnetic ﬁeld divergence equations
are satisﬁed by all the force ﬁelds considered in the previous section, as consequence of
3-vector identities, this is not true for all components of the electrodynamic Amp`ere’s law,
and the electric ﬁeld divergence equation, for the case of the RCED ﬁelds. If these latter
equations are not obeyed by the ﬁelds, Maxwell’s derivation of ‘electromagnetic waves’
breaks down for them. The interesting question then is whether some other type of ﬁeld
(classical or otherwise) does satisfy a wave equation and so may be associated with the
propagation of light. This question will be addressed in the following section. However,
it may be already stated here that the answer is in the aﬃrmative.

In recalling Maxwell’s derivation of ‘electromagnetic waves’ it will be found convenient

The Lorentz covariance of (4.3) (The Faraday-Lenz law) and (4.4) (Amp`ere’s law) are
readily demonstrated using (3.33)-(3.36). Two examples containing ﬁelds similar to those

where, in the last line, the Maxwell equation (4.1) is assumed to hold in the S’ frame. As
will be shown below, (4.1), is valid for the RCED ﬁeld only in the frame S∗ where the
source charge is at rest, i.e.
for an electrostatic ﬁeld. The calculations just performed
show that the covariance of (4.7) requires also that of the Maxwell equation (4.1), whereas
no such requirement is needed to demonstrate the covariance of (4.5). Indeed, since the
Faraday-Lenz law is an identity following directly from the deﬁnitions, (3.19) and (3.20)
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, it must be valid in any frame and hence be covariant.
To show this it is only necessary to take the curl of (3.19):

The electric ﬁeld divergence equation is therefore covariant for the CEM ﬁeld but not for
the RCED one.

In order to discuss the validity of Amp`ere’s law, (4.4) for the RCED and CEM ﬁelds
it is convenient to perform a rotation by an angle φ around the x-axes of the coordinate
systems used in Eqns(3.2)-(3.12). This gives, for example, in the S system:

~E(RCED) =

The same relations hold for the CEM ﬁelds. Use of these equations and the equation,
(3.80) relating the x- and t-derivatives, also valid for both the RCED and CEM ﬁelds,
enables the x-component of Amp`ere’s law to be derived directly from the electric ﬁeld
divergence equation (4.1) with the replacement ~

So, comparing with Eqn(3.79) above, it can be seen that the y- and z-components of
Amp`ere’s law are just special cases of the general relation between x- and t-derivatives:

that is a necessary consequence of the space-time functional dependence of both the RCED
and CEM potentials and ﬁelds in the frame S. Thus the x- and y-components of Amp`ere’s
law are valid for both the RCED and CEM ﬁelds of a moving charge.

Because of Eqn(4.15) and the universal validity of the Faraday-Lenz law, the deriva-
tion of the electromagnetic wave equation for the electric CEM ﬁeld follows exactly the
algebra of Eqn(4.10)-(4.11) above. By the same token the wave equation for the magnetic
CEM ﬁeld is obtained by combining the curl of (4.4) with the time derivative of (4.3)
as for the classical ﬁelds ~
. However, this is no longer true for the RCED ﬁelds.
E
Straightforward calculation using Eqns(4.14) and (4.23) and the partial derivatives given
in Eqns(B4)-(B8) of Appendix B, shows that for the RCED ﬁelds the wave equations for

(4.3), in any reference frame, due to 3-vector identities. The equations are then
covariant for any ﬁelds deﬁned by the equations (3.19) and (3.20) for an arbitary
4-vector potential A, and are independent of the space-time functional dependence
of A or of the ﬁelds.

(b) The electric ﬁeld divergence equation (4.1) is satisﬁed, in any inertial frame, for
CEM but not for RCED. In the latter case the divergence is given by Eqns(4.14)
and (4.15) for the frames S and S’, and (4.1) is satisﬁed only in the frame S∗ where
the source charge is at rest.

(c) In both RCED and CEM the x-component of the left side of Amp`ere’s law may be
derived from the electric ﬁeld divergence equation by use of the relations (3.79) and
(4.20). The resulting equation reduces to (4.4) for the CEM ﬁelds, but not for the
RCED ones where, in the frame S, the non-covariant result Eqn(4.23) is obtained
instead.

(d) In both RCED and CEM, the y- and z-components of Amp`ere’s law for the ﬁelds of
a uniformly moving charge are veriﬁed and shown to be a direct consequence of the
universal relations (4.20) between transverse electric and magnetic ﬁeld components
and the general relation (3.79) between xq- and t-derivatives. The latter follows from
the space-time functional dependence of the RCED and CEM ﬁelds. This gives a
natural explanation, in this case, of Maxwell’s ‘displacement current’ in Amp`ere’s
law (4.4) that was originally ‘added by hand’.

(e) Derivation of the wave equations for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds proceeeds, for
the CEM ﬁelds, in a similar manner as for the classical ﬁelds shown in Eqns(4.10)-
(4.12), due to the validity of Eqn(4.1) in this case. This is no longer true for RCED
where ~
= 0 and where the wave equations are replaced by Eqns(4.30)-(4.35).
Only Bx (which vanishes for a uniformly moving source charge) satisﬁes a wave

What now is the impact of these results on the status of the discovery of the Lorentz
transformation by requiring covariance of the free-space Maxwell equations, and of Maxwell’s
derivation of ‘electromagnetic waves’ by combining three of his equations: (4.1), (4.3) and
(4.4) for waves in the electric ﬁeld, and (4.2), (4.3) and (4.4) for waves in the magnetic
ﬁeld?

Firstly, it is clear that the derivation of the Lorentz transformation has been carried
out under the hypothesis that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are classical, with the space-
time functional dependence of (3.56). This is true for neither to RCED or CEM force
ﬁelds discussed so far in the present paper. The actual functional dependence is similar to
that of Eqns(3.54) and (3.55). This implies that the space and time derivatives transform,
not according to Eqns(3.33)-(3.35), appropriate for a classical ﬁeld, but rather according
to:

with appropriate values of ˜β in the frame S ( ˜β = βu) or S’ ( ˜β =
βw). Indeed, as shown
in Appendix A, the relation (4.36) is essential for the derivation of the CEM ﬁelds from
the ‘present position’ potentials in (3.51) and(3.52).

So the Lorentz transformation has been derived by requiring covariance of hypothetical
classical electric and magnetic ﬁelds with space-time functional dependence markedly
diﬀerent from the actual RCED or CEM force ﬁelds of classical electrodynamics. Does
this mean that the Lorentz transformation is incorrect? The answer to this question is
deﬁnitely ‘no’, because the Lorentz transformation may be independently derived from
other simple axioms that are quite unrelated to classical electromagnetism as invoked by
Lorentz or Poincar´e –covariance of Maxwell’s equations, or, in the case of Einstein, by
the hypothesis of the constancy of the speed of light. This point will be further discussed
below.

Concerning the derivation of the wave equation for the electric ﬁeld, this does not nec-
essarily require the ﬁelds to have the classical space-time functionality of Eqn(2.56). Since
the CEM force ﬁelds do, as shown above, satisfy all four Maxwell equation the derivation
proceeds as in Eqns(4.10)-(4.12) for the classical ﬁelds. However the corresponding po-
tentials (3.106) and (3.107) do not transform as a 4-vector and the corresponding electric
and magnetic ﬁelds of (3.7) and (3.8) give rise to relativistic paradoxes [10], and are in
fact experimentally excluded by the observation of electromagnetic induction in the case
of a stationary coil and a uniformly moving magnet [11] as well as by the recent direct
experimental demonstration of the non-retarded character of force ﬁelds [2, 3]. It will be
demonstrated in the following section that, in any case, the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials
do not correctly represent solutions of the inhomogeneous d’Alembert equation from which
they were supposedly derived. That is, the CEM ﬁelds are the result of a mathematical
error and so actually have no physical relevance.

Actually, however, all predictions concerning intercharge forces in classical electrody-
namics are contained in the single equation (1.2) that gives directly the force on a test
charge for an arbitary position, velocity and acceleration of the source charge. These
include: Coulomb’s law, the Biot-Savart law, the Lorentz force equation and the ma-
chanical eﬀects of the Faraday-Lenz law (5.3). All of the equations (5.1)-(5.4) as well as
the deﬁnitions (3.19) and (3.20) of electric and magnetic ﬁelds are derived from simple
mathematical substitutions en route to derive (1.2) from the postulates described in the
Introduction. Thus Eqns(5.1)-(5.4) contain no information on inter-charge forces not al-
ready contained in Eqn(1.2). For example. (5.2) and (5.3), which are the same as the
corresponding Maxwell equations (4.2) and (4.3), follow immediately as 3-vector identities
from the deﬁnitions of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Note also that Eqn(5.4) contains
Maxwell’s famous and mysterious ‘displacement current’ term ∂ ~E/c∂t which is a direct
consequence of (5.1) given given (3.79) and (4.20). In fact (5.4) may be derived from (5.1)
–it is not an independent equation. This conclusion is equally valid for the CEM force
ﬁelds.

1 Eqn(5.1) reduces to the usual electric ﬁeld divergence equation
(4.1). Since Coulomb’s law is the basic physical postulate of RCED, there is no diﬀerence
between CEM and RCED as far as electrostatics is concerned. The same is true for
magnetostatics when only forces between neutral conductors carrying steady currents
are considered and corrections of O(β2) and higher are neglected. The new feature of
RCED is that nominally neutral conductors will, according to Eqn(3.3), have a small
β2
u for each conduction
transverse electric ﬁeld corresponding to an eﬀective charge
electron where e is the electron charge, and a longitudinal electric ﬁeld corresponding to
β2
an eﬀective charge
u for each conduction electron. This is because the magnitudes
of the eﬀective source charges for transverse (longitudinal) ﬁelds are greater (less) than
those of the positive ions (assumed to be essentially at rest) in the bulk matter of the
conductor. On averaging over the angle of the electric ﬁeld relative to that of the source

current there is a net charge of
β2
u in the neighbourhood of a supercondicting coil was already
for a tranverse ﬁeld
published some three decades ago [26]. At the time, no theoretical explanation for the
eﬀect observed was known.

It is important to stress that, since the force due to an electric ﬁeld on a test charge
does not depend on the velocity of the latter, these small residual electric ﬁelds in magne-
tostatics have no mechanical eﬀect on neutral systems. In particular, the very stringent
limits on the neutrality of atoms or molecules [27, 28], by detecting any force to which
they are subjected in strong electric ﬁelds, are not aﬀected by the existence of these ﬁelds.

In summary, all the purely mechanical eﬀects of classical electomagnetism –including
relativistic corrections to all orders in β, are given by the single equation (1.2) which
contains information solely on the relative spatial positions and velocities of the inter-
acting charges –no ﬁelds. As discussed at length in Reference [1], according to quantum
electrodynamics, these forces are produced by the exchange of space-like virtual photons
between the charges. The corresponding interaction is instantaeous –not retarded– in
the centre of mass frame of the charges. However these phenomena are, by far, not the
whole content of classical or quantum electrodynamics. It remains to describe radiative
processes in which, according to quantum electrodynamics, real photons are created, prop-

28

agated and destroyed. It is in this sector that both the utility of Maxwell’s equations and
the physical meaning of the ﬁelds or potentials that they contain will become evident as
well as any shortcomings in their application. Contrary to the description of mechanical
eﬀects, fully described by Eqn(1.2), for which the ﬁeld concept is inessential, the route
followed for the classical description of radiative processes will be the well-trodden one of
19th Century physics –identiﬁcation of a suitable partial diﬀerential equation to describe
a physical system, solution of the equation subject to certain boundary conditions and
the physical interpretation of the solutions found. For this programme, the concepts of
potentials and ﬁelds (although not necessarily classical ones in the sense of Eqn(3.56))
are of fundamental importance.

To distinguish the ﬁelds and potentials in the following discussion from the force ﬁelds
and associated potentials considered hitherto, roman characters will be used. The analysis
is based on the following deﬁnitions and diﬀerential equations, which are ﬁrst presented
in full, and subsequently discussed:

All ﬁelds, potentials and currents are deﬁned in the frame S where the source and test
charges are in motion, whereas the electric charge density in Eqn(5.7) is deﬁned in the
frame S∗ in which the source charges Qi are at rest. VR(~x∗
J ) is the volume of a small region,
R, at ~x∗
J containing the discrete charges Qi. Eqns(5.5) and (5.6) are the conventional
covariant deﬁnitions of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in terms of the 4-vector potential,
while (5.8) deﬁnes the 4-vector current density, J. The 4-vector potential, A, will be
obtained as a solution of the Maxwell equations with sources (5.10) and (5.11), and is
also assumed, initially, to satisfy the Lorenz condition (5.9). The latter is conventionally
presented as a particular choice of gauge (Lorenz gauge
[8]) for the deﬁnition of A.
However, as shown in [1], for the RCED force ﬁeld potentials in (3.49) and (3.50), this
formula is an identity following from the relation (4.36) connecting spatial and temporal
partial derivatives. It may be noted that the magnetic ﬁeld divergence equation and the
Faraday-Lenz law, that follow as 3-vector identities from (5.6) and (5.5) respectively, do
not appear in the following discussion. This may be contrasted with the discussion of
‘electromagnetic waves’ based on the free-space Maxwell equations in Section 4.

As is well known [29], after expressing (5.10) and (5.11) in terms of A with the aid of
(5.5) and (5.6), the Lorenz condition (5.9) may be used to eliminate ~A in (5.10) or A0 in

The reason for this diﬀerence will be discussed at the end of the present section.

As is well known, the second terms on the right sides of (5.20) and (5.21) with 1/r
dependence, each proportional to the acceleration of the source charge, give the classical
description of radiative procesess, that is the production and propagation of real photons.
Equation (5.18) predicts that these real photons propagate in free space at the speed c.
It will be shown below that the corresponding potential and ﬁelds Arad, Erad and Brad
are closely related (and, in fact, equivalent to) the quantum mechanical amplitude for the
production of one or more real photons by the accelerated source charge.

As pointed out Reference [1], QED predicts that the force ﬁelds, associated uniquely
with the exchange of space-like virtual photons, are instantaneous, so that the force
ﬁelds in (5.20) and (5.21), corresponding to photons propagating at the speed c, are not
consistent with this requirement of QED or the known kinematical properties of space-like
virtual photons. There are also inconsistent with experiment [2, 3].

For the further consideration of the radiation ﬁelds it will be assumed for deﬁnitness
that the source charge undergoes simple harmonic motion of frequency ω/(2π) parallel to
the x-axis, so that it constitutes a system of ﬁxed orientation with a harmonically varying
dipole moment:

(5.31)

This is the usual formula [35] for the energy ﬂux per unit solid angle in dipole radiation.
Note however that the electric radiation ﬁeld (5.28) diﬀers from the conventional one in
that it is not transverse to the direction ˆr but is instead parallel to the direction of the
oscillating dipole moment. The magnetic ﬁeld in (5.29) is however perpendicular to both
ˆr and ~p as in the conventional treatment.

At suﬃciently large distances from the dipole source only one or zero photons are
expected to be observed in a spatial volume dV = dSdr, where dS is an area element per-
pendicular to ~r. The probability to observe two or more photons, though non-vanishing,
is then much less than that to observe only one. As already pointed out in Ref. [36],
in these circumstances, ‘inverse correspondence’ gives a connection between the classical
and quantum mechanical descriptions of radiative processes involving real photons. In
particular, Eqn(5.31) may be directly related to the quantum mechanical description of
dipole radiation. Since dΩ = r2dS, Eqn(5.31) may be written as:

where ¯ργ(~r) is the time averaged number density of photons, each with energy Eγ. Thus

The equality of the ﬁrst and last members of (5.33) was previously noted, [36], for the case
of a plane electromagnetic wave. For suﬃciently large values of r, ¯ργ(~r)dV becomes, to a
very good approximation, the probability that a photon is observed in the volume element
dV at ~r at any instant for which the backward light cone of the ﬁeld point at the source
Ψ(~r)2
overlaps the latter during its phase of continuous oscillation. In this case ¯ργ(~r) =

where Ψ(~r) is the quantum probability amplitude (conventionally called a ‘wavefunction’)
for detection of a photon at ~r. Indeed, even the detailed time structure of the photon
detection events is already implicit in the classical calculation.

Taking the square root of (5.33) and inserting the harmonic time dependence of Brad

from Eqn(5.29), and using (5.18) gives, for the quantum probability amplitude:

The last line of Eqn(5.34) has the structure of a time-ordered Feynman path amplitude
[37]. The rightmost amplitude in (5.34) is the temporal propagator of the oscillating
source charge from the time t0, at which harmonic motion starts, to the time, tγ, at
Mγ is that for
which the detected photon is created. The time-independent amplitude
photon creation, while the ﬁrst amplitude on the right side of (5.34) is the space-time
propagator of the photon between its production and detection points. Note that since
tγ) = c = ω/k the argument of the exponential in the photon propagator vanishes, so
r/(t
that the latter is simply 1/r. It can be seen that the phase of the probability amplitude, of
no relevance for calculation of the photon ﬂux, but essential for the description of quantum
interference phenomena, is uniquely that associated with the source charge [38, 37].

Thus, the terms in the Lorenz condition associated with a constant source velocity verify
it as an identity in the same way as the instantaneous potentials (3.104), (3.105) cor-
responding to the RCED force ﬁelds of a uniformly moving charge. However, the terms
containing derivatives of the source velocity, and so associated with the radiative ﬁelds, do
not respect the condition. Thus, although (5.9) was assumed to be valid to derive (5.12)
and (5.13), the Lorenz condition holds only for the force ﬁelds, not the radiative ones. For
simple harmonic motion of the source according to (5.24), and taking the non-relativistic
limit βu →

In order to now discuss the space-time transformation properties of the radiation ﬁelds
it is convenient to associate the frame S∗ with the one in which the average velocity, due
to its simple harmonic motion, of the oscillating charge, vanishes.The frame S then moves
with constant velocity c~βu along the x-axis. Assuming the geometry of Fig.1, the radiation

the δ-function transformation (5.63) was employed to obtain the retarded potentials (5.22) and (5.23)

These potentals diﬀer from the LW ones in (5.22) and (5.23) by only an overall factor
γu. The derivation of the retarded potential just given is essentially the same as that of
Jackson [31]. Integrating ﬁrst over d3xJ and then over t′ as in (5.14) then apparently gives
a result quite diﬀerent to (5.62) where the order of integration is reversed. The problem
is complicated by the fact that the region of non-zero charge density is in motion, and
that for the case of a point charge, because of the relation (5.18) the integrals over time
~βJ ) resulting from the
and spatial position are not independent. The factor 1/(1
manipulation of the δ-function in the time integral of (5.62) has the eﬀect of multiplying
this integral by the ratio of the times for which the region of non-zero charge density lies
on the backward light cone of the test charge, when the latter is in motion, or at rest. To
see this, consider the simple case in which ~βJ is parallel to ˆrJ , so that the source charge is
moving directly towards the test charge, Suppose the the region of non-zero charge density
extends for the distance ℓ parallel to ˆrJ and that the source charge moves towards the
test charge with with velocity cβu. The distance over which the backward light cone of

however take into account the eﬀective charge density of the moving distribution. The
average charge density over the light cone overlap region of the charges in motion is less in
the ratio ℓ/L = (1
βu) than when the charges are at rest. This exactly cancels the eﬀect
of the increased overlap distance or time. That this is the right result, so that (5.19) is
correct and (5.22), (5.23) and (5.68) are wrong, becomes quite clear on examining closely
the derivation of the LW potentials given by Feynman in his ‘Lectures on Physics’ [43].
Because this is a very transparent derivation, the error which is made, once it is pointed
out, is also very transparent!

−

Feynman’s analysis of the problem of retarded potentials is illustrated in Fig.4. A
rectangular block of charge of uniform density moves towards the ﬁeld point, which is
suﬃciently far to the right that the variation of rJ may be neglected in evaluating the
integral that gives the potential. The light front, F , moves across the charge distribution,
sampling it. Each element of charge which is crossed by F gives a contribution to the
potential. The depth of the block of charge is ℓ and, as above, F moves over the distance
L while crossing the charge distribution. The passage of the front over the charge distri-
bution takes time T . Following Feynman, the distance L is divided into bins of width w
and the contribution to the potential of each bin is considered separately. In Fig.4 the
dimensions and velocity u are chosen so that:

ℓ =

2L
5

,

w =

L

It then follows that u = 3c/5. In this ﬁgure, the positions of the charge distribution and
the front F at times T /5, 2T /5 respectively are shown. In Figs.4b,4d the front has crossed
charge thicknesses of 0.4w,0.8w respectively. The region crossed during the time 0 < t <
T /5 is shown by SW-NE15diagonal cross-hatching, that crossed in T /5 < t < 2T /5 by
NW-SE diagonal cross-hatching. Thus the average charge density in each bin is reduced,
in comparison with the situation when the charges are at rest, by 60%. Integrating over
time, (5.15) then gives:

where S is the surface area of the charge distribution normal to its direction of motion
and ¯ρ∗ is the average charge density. From the geometry of Fig.4a, ¯ρ∗ = 2ρ∗/5 where ρ∗
is the rest frame charge density. Since L = 5ℓ/2 (5.70) gives:

light front with respect to the time of the ﬁeld point (5.71) agrees with Eqn(5.19) but not
with (5.68) or the LW potentials in (5.22) and (5.23).

The contributions to the integral given by the ﬁrst two bins, according to Feynman’s
original calculation [43] are shown by the SW-NE and NW-SE diagonal hatching in Figs.4c
and 4e respectively. The movement of the charge distribution is neglected, and with it

the change in the eﬀective charge density. Feynman’s result is given by replacing ¯ρ∗ in
(5.70) by ρ∗, the density of the charge distribution at rest. This gives a result consistent
with (5.68), (5.22) and (5.23), but is evidently wrong, since charge elements are multiply
counted during the passage of the light front. For example, a contribution to the integral
is assigned proportional to the area of the cross-hatched region to the left of F in Fig.4c
for t
T /5. However, inspection of Fig.4b, showing the actual geometrical conﬁguration
at t = T /5, shows that, because of the parallel motion of the charge distribution, F has
not yet crossed any corresponding region of the distribution. In fact, careful inspection of
Fig21-6(c) of Ref. [43] shows clearly that the contribution due to the passage of the light
front over the ﬁrst bin is overestimated. Only the region of the charge distribution to the
left of the light front as shown in this ﬁgure has been sampled at this time, not the ﬁlled
ﬁrst bin of Fig21-6(b).

≤

A graphic analogue of the sampling of the charge distribution by the moving light front
as shown in Fig.4 was given in Ref. [44]. The conclusion drawn, however, was just the
opposite of the correct one. The light front was compared to a group of census takers and
the charge distribution to the population of a region. If the census takers move at a certain
speed, counting the people they see every day then the relative populations of two regions
with the same population density are in the ratio of the times taken by the census takers
to cross the regions. If however, the populations are themselves migrating, this procedure
will over- (or under-estimate) the true population depending on whether the migration of
the population is with (or against) the direction of motion of the census takers. Instead
of identifying (as they should have) the correct sampling of a charge distribution with the
correct estimation of the population by the census takers, i.e. correcting for the eﬀects of
migration, the authors of Ref. [44] claimed instead that integral for the potential should
instead be associated with the biased population estimates produced by neglect of the
migration of the population!

A diﬀerent and somewhat arcane ‘derivation’ of the LW potentials is presented in
Ref. [32]. This employs the usually reliable method of expressing an equation valid in a
particular reference frame in terms of 4-vectors, in order to obtain a covariant or invariant
equation. Just this method was used to derive the Lagrangian (1.1) by the present author.
It was noted that (in the notation of the present paper) the retardation condition (5.18)
may be used to write the temporal component of A, in the frame S∗, as :

(5.72)

It was then noted that the 4-vector:

where

(5.74)
reduces to (5.72) in the rest frame, S∗, of the source charge. Eqn(5.73) gives exactly the
LW potentials of (5.22) and (5.23). The overall factor γu in u cancels from the numerator
and denominator of (5.73). This is certainly true. But it is equally true that the solution
(5.19) of the d’Alembert equations (5.12) and (5.13) also gives the relation (5.72) in S∗.

6 Summary and Outlook

Intercharge forces and electric and magnetic force ﬁelds have been considered in three
diﬀerent inertial frames: S∗, where the ‘source charge’ Q is at rest and the ‘test charge’
q is in uniform motion, S, where both source and test charges are in uniform, parallel,
motion, and S’, where the test charge is a rest and the source charge in uniform motion.

In Section 1, the equations of motion of two charges undergoing mutual electromag-
netic interaction, as derived in Ref. [1] are recalled. These equations are obtained from
only Coulomb’s law, special relativistic invariance and Hamilton’s Principle, without in-
voking any ‘force ﬁeld’ concept.
In accordance with the prediction of QED [1], the
interaction is assumed to be instantaneous. The equations (1.2) and (1.3) provide a com-
plete relativistic description of the motion in terms of the values of the charges, their
masses, their velocities, and their instantaneous spatial separation.

The space-time transformation properties, between the frames S∗, S and S’, of the
inter-charge forces given by (1.2) and (1.3), are discussed in Section 2 and presented in
Eqns(2.5)-(2.7).

In Section 3, the transformation properties of electric and magnetic ﬁelds derived by
use of the Lorentz force equation from (1.2) and (1.3), referred to as RCED (for Rel-
ativistic Classical Electro-Dynamics) ﬁelds, are compared to the corresponding ﬁelds of
conventional Classical Electro-Magnetism (CEM). The RCED and CEM force ﬁelds are
derived from the corresponding 4–vector potentials in Appendix A. Transformation laws
between the frames S∗, S and S’ are presented in (3.13)-(3.15) for the RCED ﬁelds and
in (3.16)-(3.18) for the CEM ﬁelds. Similar equations relating transverse (to the direc-
tion of motion of the source charge) electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and transformation laws
for magnetic ﬁelds, are found in the two cases. However, due to the relativistic treat-
ment of the inter-charge separation vector in CEM (in RCED it is Lorentz invariant) no
conclusions are possible, at this stage, concerning agreement between the transformation
equations of RCED and CEM electric ﬁelds. To help clarify this issue, the conventional
representation of electric and magnetic ﬁelds as elements of a second-rank antisymmetric
tensor, F αβ, is discussed. It is pointed out that the tensor space-time transformation law
of F αβ in (3.36)-(3.40) requires that each component of F αβ be a classical ﬁeld. That
is, it must be a function of the ﬁeld point coordinates xq, yq, zq and the time t, each
considered to be an independent variable. Direct calculation shows agreement between
the transformation equations of transverse electric ﬁelds and magnetic ﬁelds for F αβ (as-
sumed to be a ‘classical ﬁeld’ in the sense explained above), RCED and CEM. Diﬀerent
results, however, are obtained for the transformation law of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld
(Ex) in RCED ( E′
x = Ex ). The Ex transformation
law for CEM is considered later, after critical examination of the standard treatment of
relativistic eﬀects in CEM.

The diﬀerence between the the Ex transformation laws of RCED and F αβ is easily
understood as a consequence of the fact that neither the 4-vector potential, A, (of RCED
or CEM) nor the electric and magnetic ﬁelds obtained from the deﬁning equations (3.19)
and (3.20) are ‘classical ﬁelds’ as far as their dependence on xq and t is concerned. Due
to the dependence of A and the ﬁelds on the inter-charge separation: r =
, the
variables ~xq and t are not independent. In the case that the source charge moves parallel
to the x-axis, the partial derivatives with respect to xq and t are related according to
Eqn(3.79). Furthermore, a discussion of the deﬁnition, as a ∆t = 0 projection, of the
intercharge separation, in the frames S∗, S and S, reveals it to be a Lorentz-invariant
quantity: r∗ = r = r′. ψ∗ = ψ = ψ′. As a consequence, the x-coordinate partial
derivatives are also invariant, as shown in Eqn(3.78), rather than transforming in a way
that mixes spatial and temporal derivatives as in (3.33). Indeed the transformation law
of (3.33) is valid only when xq and t are independent variables. This is the case neither
for RCED nor CEM. Application of the correct partial derivative relations (3.78) and
(3.79) in the deﬁning equations (3.19) and (3.20) of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, using
the 4-vector transformation properities of A in (3.81)-(3.84) veriﬁes all the RCED force-
ﬁeld transformation laws. The agreement found for the transformation laws of transverse
electric ﬁelds and magnetic ﬁelds for F αβ, RCED and CEM is a consequence of the fact
that only yq partial derivatives occur in deriving them from A, and that yq is (unlike xq)
an independent (classical) variable in the functional dependence of A, in all cases, as well
as being invariant under the Lorentz transformation.

Finally, in Section 3, the claimed consistency of the Ex transformation law in (3.18)
of CEM with that (E′
x = Ex) of F αβ is examined. The relativistic analysis purporting
to demonstrate the ‘length contraction’ eﬀect (3.93) is shown to be ﬂawed because of
the misinterpretation of Eqn(3.90) which actually relates a proper time to an apparent
time, as in (3.99) or (3.101), as a relation connecting two proper times. Correcting the
relativistic analysis it is found that the CEM electric ﬁeld transformation laws (3.102)
and (3.103) diﬀer both from those of the classical ﬁelds F αβ and the RCED ﬁelds. The
correct relativistic analysis also shows that the retarded LW potentials of CEM (unlike
the instantaneous RCED ones) do not transform as a 4-vector.

and ~
B

In Section 4 the validity of the Maxwell Equations for the RCED and CEM force
ﬁelds is investigated by direct substitution of the formulae (3.5)-(3.8) for these ﬁelds, in
the frame S, in the Maxwell Equations. As an instructive preamble, hypothetical classical
electric and magnetric ﬁelds ~
that, by hypothesis, satisfy the homogeneous free-
E
space Maxwell Equations are ﬁrst considered. The Lorentz covariance of these Maxwell
Equations is demonstrated. For the electric ﬁeld divergence equation and the Amp`ere
law the covariance is demonstrated by direct Lorentz transformation of the ﬁelds from
the frame S to S’. For the magnetic ﬁeld divergence equation and the Faraday–Lenz law
the covariance follows from the deﬁnitions of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in terms of the 4-
vector potential in virtue of 3-vector identities, independently of the space-time functional
dependence of the potential or the ﬁelds. This result holds for both the RCED and CEM
force ﬁelds.

Maxwell’s derivation of wave equations for the classical ﬁelds ~
E

is also recalled.
The derivation of the wave equation for the electric ﬁeld assumes that Gauss’ law holds
for the electric ﬁeld. Gauss’ law for the magnetic ﬁeld, used to derive the wave equation

and ~
B

42

for the magnetic ﬁeld, is however, as pointed out above, a necessary consequence of the
deﬁnition, (3.20), of the magnetic ﬁeld and a 3-vector identity, and so does not need to
be introduced as a postulate in the derivation of the wave equation.

Direct calculation, presented in Appendix B, shows that while the CEM ﬁelds satisfy
the electric ﬁeld divergence equation and Amp`ere’s law, this is not the case for the RCED
ﬁelds. The covariance of the electric ﬁeld divergence equation is broken by terms of
O(β4) which, as previously pointed out [6], lead to a breakdown of Gauss’ law for these
ﬁelds. The covariance-breaking term in Amp`ere’s law for the RCED ﬁelds are of O(β5).
Although the covariance-breaking terms of the electric ﬁeld divergence equation contain

both the RCED and CEM ﬁelds that Amp`ere’s law may be derived from the electric
ﬁeld divergence equation, given the general relations, (4.20), between transverse electric
ﬁeld components and the magnetic ﬁeld, and the relation (3.79) connecting the xq- and
t-partial derivatives. Thus in both RCED and CEM Amp`ere’s law (including Maxwell’s
added-by-hand ‘displacement current’) is a necessary consequence of the electric ﬁeld
divergence equation, not an independent law.

Because the CEM ﬁelds verify all four Maxwell Equations the derivation of the wave
equations for electric and magnetic ﬁelds are the same as for the hypothetical classical
ﬁelds ~
(~x, t). Because of the non-covariant nature of the RCEM ﬁelds however,

they do not satisfy wave equations (see Eqns(4.29)-(4.34)).

In Section 5, the force ﬁelds discussed in the previous four sections (phenomenologi-
cal manifestatations of the exchange, in QED, of space-like virtual photons between the
‘source’ and ‘test’ charges [1]). are contrasted with radiation ﬁelds, that provide a clas-
sical description of the QED processes of production, propagation and absorption of real
photons.
It is suggested that though the ﬁeld concept may be avoided completely for
the description of intercharge forces, it must play an important role in the description
of radiation. The standard text-book derivation of scalar and vector retarded poten-
tials as solutions of inhomogeneous d’Alembert equations, obtained by eliminating either
the scalar of the vector potentials from the electric ﬁeld divergence equation (5.10) or
Amp`ere’s law (5.11) with sources, with the aid of the Lorenz condition (5.9), is recalled.
Specialising to a point-like source charge yields the retarded potentials of (5.19), diﬀering
notably from the retarded Li´enard-Wiechert potentials (5.22) and (5.23) to be found in all
test-books on CEM. The reason for this diﬀerence (and the incorrectness of the LW po-
tentials and the CEM ﬁelds derived from them) is explained at the end of Section 5. The
retarded potentials of (5.19) are used to derive the retarded electric and magnetic ﬁelds
of (5.20) and (5.21) respectively. These calculations are reported in Appendix C. The
terms proportional to 1/r2 are found to be identical, apart from an overall multiplicative
factor and a retarded time argument, to the RCEM force ﬁelds of Eqns(3.5) and (3.6),
and quite diﬀerent to the retarded CEM ﬁelds derived from LW potentials. As is usually
done, the terms proportional to 1/r in Eqns(5.20) and (5.21) are identiﬁed with ‘radiation
ﬁelds’. Specialising to a source charge undergoing simple harmonic motion, taking the
non-relativistic limit, and using the Poynting vector to calculate the time-averaged ﬂux
of radiated energy, enables the standard text book formula, (5.31), for the energy ﬂux of
dipole radiation per unit of solid angle to be derived. The close correspondence of this

formula in the limit of large distances and low photon density to the quantum mechanical
path amplitude description [37] or photon production by an atomic dipole transition [39]
is pointed out.

The validity of the Lorenz condition is tested by direct substitution of the retarded
potentials (5.19) in the terms on the left side of (5.9). This calculation is also reported
1/r2 containing the

on the acceleration of the source charge, which correspond to the radiation ﬁelds. In the
non-relativistic limit the temporal component of A vanishes so that this limit is equivalent
to a gauge where A0 = 0 (Hamiltonian, or temporal gauge [8]). However this does not
imply (as is usually assumed) that ~
In fact, as shown in
(5.45),~
~A = ikA where k is the photon wave-number. An immediate consequence is
that ~A (if interpreted as a polarisation vector) is not transverse to the direction of the
photon momentum vector. Indeed it is clear from inspection of (5.10) that ~A is, instead,
parallel to the axis of the oscillating dipole source. .

~A = 0 (Coulomb gauge).

The calculation of the ﬂux of radiated energy using the Poynting vector is repeated
in a frame where the dipole source has a relativistic average velocity. The distribution is
found to be markedly diﬀerent from that obtained by direct relativistic transformation of
the distribution from the frame where the mean velocity of the oscillating source charge
vanishes. The radiation ﬁelds and the Poynting vector therefore only give a correct de-
scription of the radiation pattern in the non-relativistic approximation, and in this latter
frame.

At the end of Section 5 the discrepancy between the retarded 4-vector potential (5.19)
and the LW potentials (5.22),(5.23) is investigated. It is shown that inverting the order of
the space and time integrations as in Eqn(5.62) has the eﬀect of weighting the contribution
of a given spatial point to the retarded potential by a factor proportional to the time of
overlap of the point in question with the region of non-vanishing charge density (assumed
to be uniform). The change in the average charge density at the point, due to the
motion of the charge, must then be taken into account. This has not been done in the
calculation of the LW potentials, thus overestimating the value of the retarded potential
for a charge distribution moving towards the ﬁeld point at which the potential is to be
determined, and underestimating it for a charge distribution moving away from the ﬁeld
point. The error is clearly evident on a careful examination of Feynman’s derivation of the
LW potentials [43] (see Fig.4). Another ‘derivation’ of the incorrect LW potentials [32]
is based on an unsupported relativistic ansatz (5.73) that reduces to the usual Coulomb
law (5.72) in the rest frame of the source charge.

The RCEM formulae derived in Ref. [1] and Section 5 of the present paper diﬀer in
many respects from the standard text-book CEM formulae that were proposed or derived
in the 19th Century before the advent of special relativity theory or quantum mechanics.
The sources of these diﬀerences are ﬁve-fold:

(i) In accordance with the predictions of QED, as discussed in detail in Ref. [1], the
potential associated with the RCED force ﬁelds is assumed to be instantanaeous,
not retarded according to the speed of light in free space, as in CEM.

44

(ii) In the standard text-book treatment of the CEM formulae, all originating from
before the advent of special relativity, relativistic eﬀects, based on the space-time
Lorentz transformation are misinterpreted. In particular a non-existent ‘length con-
traction’ eﬀect (3.93) is invoked in the discussion of the ﬁeld transformation laws.
As shown in previous papers written by the present author [18, 19, 20, 21], such a
misinterpretation of the space-time eﬀects of special relativity is quite general. All
text books on special relativity need to be re-written, as well as the chapters in text
books on classical electromagnetism dealing with relativity.

(iii) The usual assumption that electric and magnetic ﬁelds are ‘classical’ ones in the
sense that each Cartesian coordinate and the time may be considered to be inde-
pendent variables is manifestly incorrect unless all source charges are at rest. The
CEM transformation law for the longitudinal electric ﬁeld: E′
x = Ex is therefore
incorrect.

(iv) There is a simple calculational error (double-counting or under-counting) in the

derivation of the retarded LW potentials of CEM.

(v) In RCEM, unlike CEM, a clear distinction is made between the deﬁnitions and phys-
ical meanings of instantaneous force ﬁelds (virtual photon exchange) and retarded
radiation ﬁelds (real photon eﬀects).

It is possible that a correct equation is ‘derived’ in a spurious manner, if, for example,
the eﬀects of two false hypotheses happen to cancel or if properties are assigned to to
some hypothetical (and non-existent) physical system that results in the derivation of an
equation that correctly describes some aspect of another, actually existing, but diﬀerent,
physical system. Indeed, as discussed later, just the second scenario occured in the case
of Maxwell’s ‘electromagnetic waves’. Because of this it is important to note that the
CEM electric force ﬁeld of (3.7) is wrong, not only because of calculational error in
its derivation but because it is experimentally excluded. As pointed out elsewhere [11]
the crucial experiment was performed by Michael Faraday in 1831 when he moved a bar
magnet inside a stationary solenoidal coil and observed an induced e.m.f. This requires an
electric ﬁeld at the conduction electrons in the coil that is perpendicular to the direction
of motion of the magnet. No such ﬁeld can be generated by the atomic electrons in
the magnet if the associated electric ﬁelds are radial as in (3.7), whereas the observed
electromagnetic induction eﬀect is correctly described [11] by the non-radial electric ﬁeld
of (3.5).

In connection with (i) above, the non-retarded nature of electric and magnetic force

ﬁelds has recently been experimentally demonstrated in a conclusive manner [2, 3].

The existence of a transverse ‘electric ﬁeld in magnetostatics’ proportional to I 2 as
predicted by (3.5) was experimentally demonstrated three decades ago [26] although the
eﬀect, at variance with the predictions of CEM, was not understood at the time.

Concerning (iii), experimental tests are now possible of the ‘relativity of simultaneity’
of special relativity, which implies the existence of a ‘length contraction’ eﬀect similar
to that invoked in the standard relativistic interpretation of CEM. Two such tests have
recently been proposed [45]. At the time of writing there is no experimental evidence

45

for either relativity of simultaneity, as proposed by Einstein, nor the associated length
contraction eﬀect. The work presented in Refs [18, 19, 20, 21] concludes that both these
eﬀects are spurious, and do not occur in nature, in contrast to the well-experimentally-
veriﬁed time dilatation eﬀect.

What then is the outlook on the CEM of the late 19th Century, as viewed from the
beginning of the 21st? Two of the greatest achievements of physics in the 20th Century
were special relativity theory and quantum mechanics. At mid-century, these two dis-
ciplines were combined to create Quantum Electro-Dynamics (QED), the most powerful
and successful physical theory, within its domain of applicabilty, ever invented by man. In
particular, QED provides the constructive basis for both Einstein’s formulation of special
relativity and CEM. Electric and magnetic forces result, according to QED, from the ex-
change of space-like virtual photons. ‘Electromagnetic waves’ are, in QED, beams of real
photons. From this viewpoint, it was Maxwell, not Einstein who discovered the photon.
Indeed many essential features of quantum mechanics are are already implicit in ‘electro-
magnetic waves’ interpreted as beams of monochromatic photons [36]. Furthermore, the
existence of the photon is crucial for a simple understanding of Einstein’s development of
special relativity. According to special relativistic kinematics, the velocity v of a particle
of rest mass m and momentum p is given by the relation:

v =

pc2
(m2c4 + p2c2)

1
2

(6.1)

It follows from this that the velocity of any massless particle, in any inertial frame, is
the constant c. Thus the identiﬁcation of light with massless particle –photons, renders
redundant Einstein’s counter-intuitive second postulate of special relativity [36, 46].

However, from a modern viewpoint it can be seen that, fundamentally, special relativ-
ity is quite independent of CEM or any other speciﬁc dynamical theory, in any domain
of physics. This, though apparently not generally known, was realised as early as 1910
by Ignatowsky [48]. As shown in Refs [46, 47], apart from some weak postulates such as
linearity or single-valuedness of the space-time transformation equations, either one of the
following two postulates is suﬃcient to derive the Lorentz transformation and therefore
all the physical consequences of special relativity:

(I) [46] Reciprocal space-time measurements of similar measuring rods and
clocks in two different inertial frames by observers at rest in these frames
give identical results.

(II) [47] The equations describing the laws of physics are invariant with
respect to the exchange of space and time coordinates, or, more generally to
the exchance of spatial and temporal components of four-vectors.

In the derivation of the Lorentz transformation based on I [46] a parameter, V , ap-
pears naturally in the proof, as the maximum possible relative velocity of two inertial
frames. Relativistic kinematics, which yields Eqn(6.1), with c
V , then shows that V

So, although the Lorentz transformation was discovered as that one which rendered
invariant the Maxwell Equations in diﬀerent inertial frames, at the most fundamental
level it has no necessary connection with CEM or any other dynamical theory. The role
of the Maxwell Equations in the development of special relativity is therefore of an essen-
tially heuristic nature. In the same way, from a modern viewpoint (i.e. knowing QED),
Maxwell’s ‘electromagnetic waves’ were a heuristic device pointing towards the existence
of real photons –massless particles with constant velocity. Actually, as shown above, the
‘electrical’ Maxwell Equations (the electric ﬁeld divergence law and the electrodynamic
Amp`ere law), associated with the RCED force ﬁelds, are not covariant and there is no
associated wave equation. However, as previously pointed out [49, 1] a clear distinction
must be made between ‘bound’ electric and magnetic ﬁelds, responsible for intercharge
forces, corresponding to an instantaneous interaction, and constituting a classical, phe-
nomenological, description of the exchange, in QED, of space-like virtual photons, and
retarded ‘radiation ﬁelds’ constituting a classical phenomenological description of the cre-
ation, propagation and absorption of real photons in QED. Thus, even if the RCED force
ﬁelds were covariant, it makes no sense to associate real photons with the corresponding
‘electromagnetic waves’. The subjacent physical process (exchange of space-like virtual
photons) occurs instantaneously. Such photons cannot be associated with a wave equation
predicting propagation at the speed c.

In a similar way, ‘electric ﬁeld energy’ and directed momentum is associated only
with the radiation ﬁelds where it is identical with that transported by real photons. The
relativistic kinematics of space-like virtual photons shows that they exchange momentum
but not energy between interacting charges in their overall centre-of-mass frame. However
the direction of momentum ﬂow, unlike for that of real photons, is ambiguous [1]. There is
therefore no divergent ‘self energy’ associated with such ‘bound’ electric ﬁelds. The former
arises from the attempt to describe an essentially quantum phenomenon (the exchange
of virtual photons), at microscopic distance scales, in terms of a classical concept (the
electric ﬁeld) appropriate only as a phenomenological description of the eﬀect of a very
large number of elementary quantum processes at macroscopic distance scales.

The non-covariance of the electrical Maxwell Equations for the RCED force ﬁelds in
(5.1) and (5.4) implies the existence of a preferred frame, and therefore a breakdown of
the special relativity principle for electromagnetic forces. This lack of covariance applies
only to the longitudinal component of electrical forces. The ‘preferred frame’ is that in
which the source charge is at rest, and as is clear from Eqn(5.4), the ‘covariance-breaking’
4-vector is just the 4-vector velocity of the source charge.

As demonstrated in Section 5, there is a close connection between the description of real
photon eﬀects provided by the radiation ﬁelds and the quantum mechanical description
of radiative processes. This becomes manifest in the ‘inverse correspondence’ [36] limit of
low photon density. However, the Poynting vector derived from the radiation ﬁelds gives
a result consistent with the quantum mechanical calculation only in the non-relativistic
limit and in a frame where the average velocity of the oscillating source charge is much
less than the speed of light.

47

In conclusion, what are the global diﬀerences between 21st Century RCED and 19th
Century CEM? When source charges or current distributions are at rest (i.e. in electro-
statics and magnetostatics) the two theories are almost indentical. Electric and static
magnetic force ﬁelds are classical so that the usual mathematical treatment (solution of
the Laplace Equation) is correct and unchanged. Similarly, the magnetic forces between
neutral current-carrying conductors are the same, to the lowest order in β, in RCED
and CEM. However, in RCED, a neutral current-carrying conductor is a source of trans-
I 2, as has been experimentally demonstrated [26].
verse or longitudinal electric ﬁelds
The magnetic ﬁeld divergence equation and the Faraday-Lenz law (both resulting from
3-vector identities) are equally valid in RCED and CEM, as is also the Lorentz force
equation. However, the electric ﬁeld divergence equation and the electrodynamic Amp`ere
law are not obeyed by the RCED force ﬁelds, the covariance-breaking terms being of
O(β4) and O(β5) respectively. In both RCED and CEM the electrodynamic Amp`ere law
may be derived from the electric ﬁeld divergence equation and so does not represent an
independent physical law. In practical (engineering) applications of Maxwell’s Equations,
where all relativistic corrections may be safely neglected, RCED and CEM are completely
equivalent.

∝

The radiation ﬁelds of RCED and CEM provide a pheonomenological description of
quantum processes involving real photons in the limit of very high photon densities, In
the non-relativistic limit, appropriate to dipole radiation, RCEM and CEM give identical
predictions for the radiation pattern. All physical eﬀects described by the radiation ﬁelds
must, however, be ultimately derivable from quantum mechanics. As often strongly em-
phasised by Feynman, the only fundamental description of the world is that provided by
quantum mechanics. Classical physics always corresponds to a deﬁnite limit of quantum
mechanics. Two examples are h
0 where classical mechanics is recovered from quan-
tum mechanics, and the Decoherence limit when the number of interacting elementary
quantum systems becomes large and quantum interference eﬀects are strongly damped,
giving classical statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The inverse limit, in which
it is attempted describe microscopic quantum systems in terms of the macroscopic con-
cepts of classical physics is generally not a useful one to consider. The properties of large
systems can be derived from those of their elementary constituents, together with their
mutual interactions of the latter, but the macroscopic classical dynamical variables appro-
priate for the large system are not applicable to the quantum dynamics of a constituent
microsystem.

→

In the usual interpretation of CEM, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are assumed
to be the fundamental physical entities which ‘exist’ and are observed, whereas the 4–
vector potential is only a ’non-observable’ mathematical construction that may be used to
parametrise, in non-unique manner, the ‘physical’ ﬁelds. This non-uniqueness is encapsu-
lated in the concept of ‘Gauge Invariance’[8]. On the contrary, in RCED the fundamental
physical entities are electric charges and (as in QED) real and virtual photons. The phys-
ical observables are not ﬁelds but the intercharge forces themselves. Only static classical
electric and magnetic force ﬁelds may be deﬁned, but they are not the fundamental en-
tities of the theory, but rather second-level mathematical abstractions, useful to write
equations for inter-charge or inter-current forces in a more compact manner. The ﬁrst
level mathematical abstraction is the 4–vector potential. But even this is not needed to
provide a description of all mechanical aspects of classical electrodynamics. This is given

48

by Eqns(1.2) and (1.3) which contain neither ﬁelds nor potentials. The situation is such
that the most fundamental objects of the theoretical description (electric charges in mo-
tion) are the furthest removed from the observed physical phenomena (the inter-charge
forces) that are predicted by the theory. The 4–vector potential is an abstract quantity
completely deﬁned by the kinematial and spatial conﬁguration of the interacting charges.
The force ﬁelds are further mathematical abstractions completely deﬁned by the 4–vector
potential and Eqns(3.19) and (3.20). The observed physical eﬀects, the forces acting on
the charges, are ﬁnally given by the Lorentz force formula in terms of the ﬁelds. The force
ﬁelds are therefore, in their deﬁnition, very close the the observed physical phenomenon
but very far removed from the objects of the fundamental theoretical description. The
mistake of the creators and present proponents of CEM (as viewed, with hindsight and
knowledge of QED, from the beginning of the 21st Century) was, following Faraday and
Maxwell, to assign, in the theory, a fundamental theoretical status to the ﬁelds and not
to charges and their mutual interaction.

Of course, the inter-charge interaction is completely symmetric between ‘source’ and
‘test’ charges. Either one of them can be considered as the ‘source’ of the 4–vector
potential and the ﬁelds. This alone shows that the 4–vector potential and ﬁelds do not
‘exist’ in same way that the charges do, but are only useful mathematical abstractions.

The physical meaning of the radiation ﬁelds is quite diﬀerent to that of the force ﬁelds.
The square of these ﬁelds is proportional to the spatial energy density of real photons.
These ﬁelds do not give the force on a test charge. The physical reason for the quadratic
dependence of the energy density on the ﬁeld strength is understood by considering the
low photon density limit at large distances from the source. In this region the radiation
ﬁelds may be identiﬁed with the wave function of a real photon [36]. In can be seen in
this way that Born’s interpretation of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics is already
implicit in RCED or CEM in the limit of very high photon densities where the square of
the radiation ﬁeld measures not the probability to ﬁnd a photon in the region of a ﬁeld
point, but the energy density of photons there.

The work leading to the results presented in the present paper provided many surprises
(not to say shocks!) for the author. Chief among these was ﬁnding the mathematical error
in the derivation of the LW potentials. Why has it taken more than a century to notice
this simple mistake? The message of this paper has been that we should use the many
advances in our understanding of physics made during the 20th Century (special relativity,
particle physics and QED) to illuminate and comprehend at a deeper level the classical
physics of the 19th Century. Hopefully, in the future, such an approach will permeate
both yet-to-be-written text books and the way that physics is taught to new generations.

Appendix A

The RCED and CEM electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the frame S are here derived from
the deﬁning equations (3.19) and (3.20) and the 4-vector potentials: (3.49),(3.50) for the
RCED ﬁelds, and (3.51),(3.52) for the CEM ﬁelds. The RCED potentials may be obtained,
as shown below, from the electrostatic Coulomb potential, whereas the ’present time’ CEM
potentials are derived from the retarded Li´enard-Wiechert ones, as described, for example,
in Ref‘[44]. In the frame S∗ the 4-vector potential has the form A∗ = (Q/r∗; 0, 0, 0). Since
the intercharge separation is a Lorentz scalar (see Section 3 above), r∗ = r, the potentials
in the frame S (3.49) and (3.50), are directly obtained by Lorentz transformation of A∗
into the frame S, yielding A = (γuQ/r; γuβu/r, 0, 0). Substituting this potential into (3.19)

Appendix B

Here the validity of the free-space Maxwell equation (4.1) is tested, for the case of
RCED and CEM force ﬁelds generated by a uniformly moving charge, by direct sub-
stitution of the ﬁelds in the frame S, given by Eqns(3.5)-(3.8), into Eqn(4.1). Since the
Maxwell equations involve derivatives of the ﬁelds, and because the derivative of a vanish-
ing quantity does not necessarily vanish, full account must be taken of the 3-dimensional
geometry of the ﬁelds. This is done by rotating the coordinate systems in (3.2)-(3.12) by
an angle φ about the x-axes as in Eqns(4.18) and (4.19). The angle φ is that between the
y-axis and the projection of the radius vector connecting the source and test charges onto
the y-z plane. The following deﬁnitions are used:

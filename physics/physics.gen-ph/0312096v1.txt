A comparison between the forces which resist the acceleration of an electron inmersed
in zero-point radiation and the force required to overcome the inertia inherent to me

R. Alvargonz´alez and L. S. Soto

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

In this paper it is shown that the forces which resist the acceleration of me, arising from the
Compton eﬀect, the Klein-Nishima-Kann formula for its diﬀerential cross section and the transversal
Doppler eﬀect when the electron moves in a straight line at any constant acceleration, are equal to
the force required to propel me with the same acceleration, if the radius of the electron is equal to
its classical radius and if the forces which rise from the interaction of the electron and zero-point
radiation are equal to those deriving from the electrostatic repulsion of the charge or the electron
against itself (Poincar´e’s tensions). If both this conclusion and the ﬁnal one on paper [3] (References)
are true, there cannot exist any diﬀerence between inertial mass and gravitational mass, because
both of them are consequences of the Compton eﬀect and the Klein-Nishima-Kann formula.

INTRODUCTION

• The minimum wavelengh in zero-point radiation is

Sparnaay’s experiments in 1958 [4] showed the exis-
tence of zero-point radiation which Nernst had consid-
ered as a possibility in 1916. This radiation is inherent
to space, and for that to be the case its spectral density
function must be inversely proportional to the cubes of
its wavelengths. In other words, the number of photons
of wavelength λ which strike a given area during a given
period must be inversely proportional to λ3.
In 1969,
Timothy H. Boyer [4] deduced that the spectral density
function of zero-point radiation is:

where λ∗ is the number which measures the wavelength
λ.

To this function there corresponds the energy function

fϕ(λ) =

1
2π2

1
(λ∗)3

Eϕ(λ) =

1
2π2

hc
λ

1
(λ∗)3

For λ = 0, Eϕ(λ) = ∞. There must therefore exist a

threshold for λ which will henceforth be written as qλ.

In order to simpify the following arguments, it is con-
venient to use the (e, me, c) system of measurements in
which the basic magnitudes are the quantum of electrical
charge, the mass of the electron and the speed of light. In
this system the units of length and time are, respectively,
le = e2/mec2 and te = e2/mec3. Moreover, the following
results and formulae obtained in titles [2] and [3] of the
references are basic.

• The ﬂow of the zero-point photons of wavelength
nqλ through an area (qλ)2 is one photon in a lapse
3

of time n3qτ where qτ = qλ/c. Therefore

(cid:19)
photons of wavelength nqλ will ﬂow through an
area (le)2 during any lapse of time te, where kλ =
le/qλ = te/qτ . See the ﬁnal result of [2].

• The electron is conﬁgured as a spherical surface,
as a result of the equilibrium between centrifu-
gal forces of electrostatic repulsion, and centripetal
forces derived from interaction with zero-point ra-
diation which plays the role of Poincare’s tensions.
Interaction with any photon of this radiation oc-
curs ﬁrst in an area (qλ)2 situated on the surface of
the electron and entering it, and afterwards in an
area (qλ)2 situated on the surface of the electron
and emerging from it (Fig. 3). Therefore if the en-
ergy ﬂow transferred ﬁrstly is kWx, the energy ﬂow

2

transferred when emerging from it is k(Wx − kWx),
whence:

WTx = Wx(2k − k2). See [3], p. 10

These values have been obtained in [3], p. 14 from
equations (2), (3), (4) and (5). The value of kλ
means that the highest energy of a photon, that
of a photon of wavelength 1qλ, is 1.595 × 1019eV ,
which agrees with the most recent measurements of
ultra high energy cosmic rays.

II. ON ZERO-POINT RADIATION WITHIN A
REFERENCE SYSTEM S′ MOVING IN A
STRAIGHT LINE AND WITH UNIFORM
ACCELERATION, AND ON ITS INTERACTION
WITH AN ELECTRON AT REST IN S′

Let us consider a reference system S′ which coincides
with the inertial system S0, until at t = 0 it begins to
move along the axis OX at a uniform acceleration “a”,
and which after the lapse t1 coincides with the inertial
system S1 which is moving at a velocity v1 = at1 relative
to S0. It is obvious that the zero-point radiation at S1 has
the same spectral composition as at S0, but this does not
happen with S′, which continues to move at a uniform
acceleration “a”.

After a minimal lapse of time qτ , the zero-point radia-
tion photons of wavelength λ in S1, which at t = t1 arrive

∆v = aq

le
(te)2 te,

kλqλ
(kλqτ )2 kλqτ = a
which reveals that the increase in velocity per qτ given
qλ
by an acceleration of aq
(qτ )2 is the same as the increase
le
(te)2 ; this

of velocity per te given by an acceleration of aq

allows us to write:

∆v = ate = q

le
(te)2 te = ac

We should point out here the enormous size of the unit
of acceleration in the (e, me, c) system, compared with
the unit of the same magnitude in the (c.g.s.) system.
The relation between them is given by:

le
(te)2 =

=

c
te

2.997925 × 1010 cm/s
−24 s
9.399639 × 10
= 3.189404 × 1033 cm
(s)2 .

One result of this that the acceleration required to
move in one second from rest to the speed of light;
which in the (c.g.s.) system is 2.997925 × 1010 cm/(s)2, is
9.399639 × 10−24 le/(te)2 when expressed in the (e, me, c)
system. This shows that the values of “a” are minuscule
for the accelerations which can be produced in physical
reality, excepting those which could be produced in the
process of the Big-Bang. It is therefore reasonable to con-
clude that “a” is an extremely small number, certainly
less than 10−23.

Figure 1 shows the zero-point radiation which, at t =
t1, arrives at P so as to make an angle θ with O′X ′ and
that, as aforesaid, are perceived in S′ as if proceeding
from a light-source Fϕ, situated on a line which passes
ale
through P and moving at a velocity ∆v =
(te)2 te = ac
relative to O′, along a line parallel to O′X ′. As a result
of the Doppler lateral relativistic eﬀect (OLRE), their
wavelength in S′ is:

′
0 = λ
λ

1 − β cos θ
(1 − β2)1/2 ;

where λ is the wavelength of emission in Fϕ, β = v/c and
−v the velocity of the source Fϕ relative to O′.

We have already established that the ﬂow of zero-point
radiation photons of wavelength nqλ through a frame of
area (le)2 is one of (kλ/n)3 photons for each lapse te.
Viewed from the system of reference S′, moving at veloc-
ity ate relative to the inertial system S1, and along the
axis OX, this number of photons appears to pass through
a frame of area:

The fact that the intensity of the ﬂow N ′

tons of wavelength λ which arrive at O′ following a tra-

frame of area (l′
e, does not dif-
fer signiﬁcantly from the intensity of the analogous ﬂow
Nnθ, enables us to establish the value of N ′
N θ without
diﬃculty. From Fig. 2 we can see that if Nn is the num-
ber of photons of wavelength nqλ which arrive from all
directions of space at a frame of area (le)2 within a lapse
te, and if that number corresponds to the area 4π(Nn)2
of a spherical surface of radius Nn, the number, Nnθ,
of those which arrive at the said frame within the same

Figure 3 shows the equatorial section of an electron at
rest at O′, in system S′. Because of the Doppler lateral
relativistic eﬀect, the photons of wavelength λ emitted
by Fϕ, moving at velocity −a∆v = −ate relative to O′
along a straight line parallel to O′X ′, and which on ar-
rival at points P1 and P2 make an angle θ with O′X ′ are
perceived at those points as having a wavelength:

nqλ which arrive at all the points P of intersection be-
tween the surface of the electron and the cone having
its apex at Q and making an angle 2θ at that apex, is

are correct.

The number of zero-point radiation photons of wave-
length nqλ, striking an area (qλ)2 every n3qτ was deduced
in [2] from Sparnaay’s measurements; this number turned
out to be 1, perhaps 2 would also ﬁt. Larger numbers
would produce values ρ > 1, for the reﬂectance. Finally
it was conjectured that the true radius of the electron, rx,

and Fig. 4 show sections along the plane Z ′O′X ′, and
to every point P ′ in the surface of the electron there
corresponds a direction cone with apex O′ and apex angle

Fig. 5 also shows that the directions coming from

those which arrive
at the electron’s surface “from outside”, are such that

vary with respect to P0 are the limits of integration, and

is equal to its classical radius, because mele = e2/c2 is a
quantum threshold for the magnitude EL, and me = 1.
This looks as a very bold conjecture, since the same ar-
gument would give, for the electron, a diameter equal
to le, in which case its radius would be equal to re/2.
Notwithstanding the value rx = re/2 is not possible, be-
cause Feynman showed that for rx = (2/3)re the whole
mass of the electron would be present as electromagnetic
mass. For rx < (2/3)re the electromagnetic mass would
be greater than its whole mass, which is inadmissible.
Keeping this considerations in mind and recalling the
fact that charges (e/3) and (2e/3) do exist, the following
conjectures have been tested, with the respective results

implied that the models were plausible. We have now
introduced a further equation derived from considering
something very diﬀerent from what we studied before –
the Doppler lateral eﬀect of the zero-point radiation pho-
tons which strike an electron moving in a straight line
with uniform acceleration. The fact that this equation
leads to an acceptable result implies that it and the two
earlier equations are related to each other through their
relations with physical reality, because they compose a
system of three equations with two variables, kλ and x,
which otherwise would have no solution. This implica-
tion leads, therefore to accept:

III. CONCLUSIONS

qλ per le).

If the result of this paper is considered admissible, it
would convincingly show that the earlier papers [2] and
[3] represent something more than mere “technical mod-
els”. The agreement of the value they found for the
energy of a photon of wavelength 1qλ, with the latest
measurements obtained by observations of cosmic rays

• That the wavelengths of photons are multiples of

qλ, i.e. that they are quantiﬁed.

• That zero-point radiation explains Poincar´e’s ten-

sions, gravitation and inertia.

• The conjecture that the electron is conﬁgured as a
spherical surface of radius equal to its classic radius.

• A value of 3, 6240926 × 1010 for kλ (the number of

• A value of 3, 9862136 × 1014 for x (the number of qλ
per the wavelength of the photon of greatest energy
in present zero-point radiation).

• A value of 1, 595 × 1019eV for the photon of wave-
length (qλ); i.e. the highest energy of a photon.

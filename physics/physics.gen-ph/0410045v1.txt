Abstract

Classical model

SD is constructed.

SD is the
SDcl of the Dirac particle
dynamic system described by the Dirac equation. For investigation of
SD
SDcl one uses a new dynamic method: dynamic disquan-
and construction of
tization. This relativistic purely dynamic procedure does not use principles
of quantum mechanics. The obtained classical analog
SDcl is described by a
system of ordinary diﬀerential equations, containing the quantum constant
¯h as a parameter. Dynamic equations for
SDcl are determined by the Dirac
equation uniquely. The dynamic system
SDcl has ten degrees of freedom and
cannot be a pointlike particle, because it has an internal structure. There are
SDcl: (1) dynamical inter-
two ways of interpretation of the dynamic system
pretation and (2) geometrical interpretation. In the dynamical interpretation
SDcl is a two-particle structure (special case of a
the classical Dirac particle
relativistic rotator). It explains freely such properties of
SD as spin and mag-
netic moment, which are strange for pointlike structure. In the geometrical
interpretation the world tube of
SDcl is a ”two-dimensional broken band”, con-
sisting of similar segments. These segments are parallelograms (or triangles),
but not the straight line segments as in the case of a structureless particle.

1 Introduction

SD, described by the Dirac equation.
The Dirac particle is the dynamic system
This is one of wide-spread dynamic systems used in theory of quantum phenomena.
Mathematical analysis of properties of the dynamic system
SD is of undoubted
SD was investigated by many researchers. There
interest. The Dirac dynamic system
is no possibility to list all them, and we mention only some of them. First, this is
transformation of the Dirac equation on the base of quantum mechanics [1, 2].
The complicated structure of Dirac particle was discovered by Schr¨odinger [3], who
interpreted it as some complicated quantum motion (zitterbewegung). Investigation
of this quantum motion and diﬀerent models of Dirac particle can be found in
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and references therein. Our investigation diﬀers in absence of any
suppositions on the Dirac particle model and in absence of referring to the quantum
principles. We use of only dynamic methods and investigate the Dirac particle simply
as a dynamic system.

SD and its dynamic equations
is carried out by a use of the quantum mechanics principles. In particular, it means
that the quantum constant ¯h is not simply a parameter of the dynamic system
SD.
The quantum constant ¯h is provided by some additional physical meaning.
It is
supposed that, if ¯h

turns into classical dynamic system
SDcl is a pointlike relativistic particle of mass m,
Usually it is supposed that
having a spin (angular momentum) SD = ¯h/2 and magnetic momentum µD =
e¯h/mc. Procedure of transition from
SDcl is called the transition to classical

description. However, the transition to the limit ¯h
0 is not carried out in such
quantities as spin SD = ¯h/2 and magnetic momentum µD = e¯h/mc, which remain
to be quantum in the sense that they contain the unvanishing quantum constant ¯h.
One states that spin and magnetic moment are quantities, which have no classical
analog.

1. The intermediate dynamic system (1.9) is not quantum, because the dynamic
equation for the wave function Ψ is nonlinear (but this disagrees with the quantum
mechanics principles). Nonlinearity of dynamic equation for Ψ is connected with the
fact that transformation (1.8), connecting the wave function ψ and Ψ is nonlinear.
Of course, the accordance with the quantum principles must be violated at some
moment, as far as the ﬁnal dynamic system
SScl is not quantum. But it is curious
that the accordance is violated not in the time, when we set ¯h = 0, but at the
earlier stage, when the action (1.5) transforms to the action (1.9), describing the
same dynamic system

SScl.

2. The transformation (1.8), connecting wave functions Ψ and ψ contains the
quantum constant ¯h. It becomes to be singular at ¯h
0. It means essentially, that
the quantum constant ¯h is introduced in dynamic variables Ψ and Ψ∗. Hereinafter,
when ¯h
0, the quantum constant, contained in Ψ is not changed. In a similar
manner we act at disquantization of the dynamic system
SD, when we introduce the
quantum constant in deﬁnition of spin SD = ¯h/2 and magnetic moment µD = e¯h/mc.
These quantities are not changed, when we go to the limit ¯h

SD?

Finally, why do we choose the transformation (1.8) for disquantization of the
SS, but not some other? What motives are used at the choice of
dynamic system
the transformation (1.8)? What transformation should be chosen for disquantization
of the dynamic system

We know that the dynamic system (1.9) is a result of quantization of the dynamic
system (1.13). The disquantization is the operation reciprocal to the quantization.
So we choose the manner of introduction of the quantum constant ¯h into the dynamic
variable (wave function) in such a way, to obtain (1.13) as a result of disquantization
of dynamic system

SS, described by the action (1.5).

In the case of the Dirac equation the situation is another one. The dynamic
system
SD was postulated by Dirac. It was not obtained as a result of quantization
of some classical dynamic system. The fact that the result of disquantization of
SD is a relativistic particle with a spin (i.e. the relativistic generalization of the
4

→

nonrelativistic particle with a spin, described by the Pauli equation) was considered
to be evident. One needs only to invent the proper disquantization procedure.

At the disquantization of the dynamic system

SD diﬀerent authors use diﬀerent
methods [14, 15, 16, 17]. All this forces one to think that there is no general principle
of the dynamic system disquantization. The classical dynamic system (a result of
disquantization of quantum system) is obtained from some a priori consideration,
and corresponding methods of disquantization are ﬁtted to the a priori result. The
common feature of all methods of disquantization is the fact, that the dynamic
equations for the disquantized dynamic system do not contain quantum constant
¯h, although physical quantities (spin, magnetic moment) may contain unvanishing
quantum constant. It is common practice to think that the dynamic system
SDcl,
SD is a pointlike relativistic particle with
obtained as a result of disquantization of
the spin SD = ¯h/2 and magnetic moment µD = e¯h/mc. This belief has historical
origin, and one cannot substantiate it mathematically, because the result depends
on the applied methods.

Do there exist the principle of disquantization, which satisﬁes the following con-

ditions?

For the system of partial diﬀerential equations to be equivalent to a system of

Let us compare the dynamic disquantization (1.14) and the conventional method
of disquantization (when ¯h
0). The conventional method is not formalized, and
only given enough ingenuity, researchers can apply it to new quantum systems,
provided the result of disquantization is known a priori. Besides, it refers to the
quantum principles. On the contrary, the dynamic disquantization is well deﬁned
and formalized. Any literate student can apply this method for disquantization
of any new quantum system. He obtains an unique result without any a priori
information and without any reference to the quantum principles and quantum
constant.

→

If we want to have a well deﬁned disquantization procedure, we should deﬁne
it in the form of dynamic disquantization (1.14), but not by means of the limit
¯h
0. The dynamic disquantization is not a supposition, which should be founded,
or tested. It is simply a method of investigation of a continuous dynamic system
Scl. Application of this method to

SS (1.5) gives the result

We are forced to explain such evident things in details, because the ﬁrst ver-
sion [11] of this paper was rejected by several journals on physics and mathematical
physics and was not published. Referees of these journals stated that the dynamic
disquantization procedure is not substantiated properly and results of this disquan-
tization application to the Dirac particle
SD are not tested experimentally. Opinion
of the referees reﬂects the viewpoint of the scientiﬁc community, and we are forced
to explain situation despite absurdity of these objections. Note that the formula
(7.17) in [11] contains a mathematical mistake (now this mistake is corrected), but
none of referees did not recognized this real mistake, because their attention was
concentrated on critique of the dynamical disquantization procedure (1.14).

Experimental test is necessary, if one makes some suppositions, and then the
experimental test shows, whether or not these suppositions are valid. We make no
suppositions. We obtain results by means of logical reasonings and mathematical
calculations. Experimental test of our results is the same as an experimental test of
the Newtonian binomial (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2.

The dynamic disquantization (1.14) is not a supposition.

It is a deﬁnition of
the procedure. One may test consistency of this procedure. One may apply this
procedure, or not apply it, but one may not demand substantiation of the deﬁnition.
One may consider motives of such a deﬁnition, and a bit later we consider these
motives, but these motives are not a substantiation of the deﬁnition (1.14), and the
deﬁnition does not need any substantiation.

Before considerations of these motives, we try to answer the very important
question. Why the disquantization procedure has not been formalized? The dis-
quantization is a very important procedure. The dynamic disquantization (1.14)
is very simple and evident procedure, but it has not been discovered during eighty
years of the quantum mechanics existence. Why? What obstacles did prevent the
disquantization from formalization?

The general answer is as follows. Researchers believed in quantum principles and
in quantum nature of the microcosm. They cannot imagine, that quantum systems
can be investigated without a use of quantum principles. Now details. According to
dominating Copenhagen interpretation the wave function ψ of a quantum particle
is a speciﬁc quantum object, which has not a classical analog. The wave function
is supposed to describe the state of individual quantum particle. On the other
hand, the wave function of an individual quantum particle describes the state of
a continuous dynamic system, having inﬁnite number of the freedom degrees. The
classical particle is described by a discrete dynamic system, having a ﬁnite number
of the freedom degrees. To formalize the disquantization procedure, one needs to
formalize the transition from the continuous dynamic system to the discrete one.
How can one formalize the jump from inﬁnite number of the freedom degrees to the
ﬁnite one?

The problem is solved as follows. At ﬁrst, one shows that the wave function is
not a speciﬁc quantum object. The wave function is a method of description of any
ﬂuidlike continuous dynamic system [12]. Quantum systems are dynamic systems
Scl are
of such a kind. But the pure statistical ensembles
Scl] of classical systems
[
also dynamic systems of such a kind. The state of such an ensemble
Scl] may
[
E
be also described by the wave function. The classical system

semble of particles (classical, or quantum), but not an individual particle. It means
that the Copenhagen interpretation is false at the point, when it states that the
wave function describes the state of an individual particle. This statement of the
Copenhagen interpretation is incompatible with the quantum mechanics formalism
[13].

and the statistical ensemble

Note that our explanation of the situation with the formalization of the dis-
quantization procedure is purely dynamical. The diﬀerence between the quantum
system
Scl] lies in the form of dynamic equations,
[
but not in enigmatic quantum principles. Hence, the problem of the disquantization
formalization is a dynamical problem, which should be solved by dynamic methods.
Thus, there are three reasons, why the problem of the disquantization formal-
ization has not been solved: (1) belief that the wave function is a speciﬁc quantum
object, (2) belief that the wave function describes the state of individual quantum
particle, (3) belief in principles of quantum mechanics, and attempts to solve the
problem on their basis.

E

Now about physical reasons of the dynamic disquantization (1.14). Conventional
approach to disquantization is an attempt of cutting oﬀ the quantum stochasticity,
setting ¯h = 0 in the proper representation (1.9) of the action for
SS. Dynamic
disquantization does not try to cut oﬀ the quantum stochasticity. It uses existence of
such states of the statistical ensemble of stochastic systems
Sst, where the stochastic
component of the particle motion does not inﬂuence upon the regular component.
Stochasticity inﬂuences upon the regular component only in nonuniform states. This
statement is valid for all stochastic systems (but not only for quantum ones). For
instance, the mean velocity of Brownian particles is determined by the relation

vB =

D∇lnρ

−
where ρ is the Brownian particle density, and D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. If the
ensemble of Brownian particles is uniform, ρ =const, the mean velocity vanishes,
although the random motion of Brownian particles remains. Analogously, if in the
Sst] ∇u = 0 for all physical quantities u, the inﬂuence of

explanation of the dynamic disquantization, but not its substantiation.

Further we transform the action (1.1) for the Dirac particle

SD to hydrodynamical
variables, where the current components jk = ¯ψγkψ, k = 0, 1, 2, 3 are dependent
variables. We produce dynamic disquantization (1.14) and obtain classical dynamic

If our statement on the composite structure of the Dirac particle appears to be
incompatible with experimental data, this result is an argument against application
of the Dirac equation, but not against our investigation of the Dirac equation.

Investigating the Dirac particle

SD, we transform the action (1.1) to hydrody-
namic variables by means of a change of variables. In terms of the new variables
the variables jk, deﬁned by (1.4) are four dependent variables. Form of other four
dependent variables is chosen in such a way, to eliminate γ-matrices from the action.
After such a change of variables we can produce the dynamic disquantization in the
action, making the change (1.14). Thereafter the action for
SD turns into the action
SDcl, having ten degrees of freedom.

Investigating properties of classical dynamic system

2 Transformation of variables

The state of dynamic system
SD is described by eight real dependent variables (eight
real components of four-component complex wave function ψ). Transforming the
action (1.1), we use the mathematical technique [9, 10], where the wave function ψ
is considered to be a function of hypercomplex numbers γ and coordinates x. In this
case the dynamical quantities are obtained by means of a convolution of expressions
ψ∗Oψ with zero divisors. This technique allows one to work without ﬁxing the
γ-matrices representation.

The ﬁrst term in the action (4.17) is relativistic. It describes a motion of classical
Dirac particle as a whole. The last two terms in the action (4.17) are nonrelativistic.
They describe some internal degrees of freedom of the classical Dirac particle. This
internal motion (classical zitterbewegung) means that the classical Dirac particle has
some internal structure which is described by a method incompatible with relativity
principles. Maybe, the classical Dirac particle is composite. It should be considered
to be consisting of several pointlike particles. At any rate the classical Dirac particle
is not a pointlike particle. It has a more complicated structure which is described
by the variable ξ and by the second order derivative ¨x.

It is easy to see that the action (4.17) is invariant with respect to transformation
τ 0 →
˜τ 0 = F (τ 0), where F is an arbitrary monotone function. This transformation
admits one to choose the variable t = x0 as a parameter τ 0, or to choose the param-
˙x2 = 1. In the last case the parameter τ 0 is
eter τ 0 in such a way that ˙xl ˙xl = ˙x2
the proper time along the world line of classical Dirac particle. Besides, invariance
˜τ 0 = F (τ 0) leads to a connection between the

5 Solution of dynamic equations for

SDcl

We shall not consider here problems connected with relativistic non-invariance of
terms, describing internal degrees of freedom, referring to [11], where these problems
are discussed. We obtain dynamic equations generated by the action (4.17), solve
them and try to interpret the obtained solution.

SD contain oscillating component, whereas momentum of
not contain oscillating component [1] (sec.69). This oscillating motion with the

of the zitterbewegung and this classical description contains the quantum constant

Classical dynamic system

SDcl contains four rotational degrees of freedom in ad-
dition to six conventional translation degrees of freedom. It means that the classical
SDcl is not a pointlike particle, because it has internal degrees of
dynamic system
freedom. How does one interpret these additional degrees of freedom? It seems that
the dynamic system
SDcl consists of several constituents, rotating around its center
of inertia. This idea is found in accordance with the contemporary ideas, that such
Dirac particles as the proton and the neutron consist of quarks.

The simplest model of the classical dynamic system

SDcl is a rotator, i.e. two
pointlike particles connected with an elastic string. The particles rotate around their
center of mass with ﬁxed distance between them, i.e. radial motion is forbidden.
Let particles of the rotator have masses m1, m2, (m1 + m2 = m). Rotator has four
degrees of freedom. Calculations show that the rotator and the dynamic system
SDcl may have the similar parameters (similar total mass M and similar rigidity
functions), provided m1 = m2. The rotator with m1 = m2 is known as a symmetric
rotator.

We consider the case of symmetric rotator. In this case the world lines of particles

have the form

xk

(2) =

}

}

(6.1)

(6.2)

where the time x0
(2) = t is a parameter along the world lines, and a1, a2 are
distances between the particles and their center of inertia. Rotation is produced with
the angular velocity ω0. Azimuth velocity v0 = a1ω0 = a2ω0 is the same for both
particles. The length a0 = a1 + a2 of the string depends on the angular frequency
ω0 of rotation. We suppose that

As far as two masses m and M are distinguished in 25%, the question appears,
which of the two masses is observable. To solve this question, one needs to consider
the Dirac dynamic system in the given electromagnetic ﬁeld.

We shall not discuss this question here. Instead, we discuss another important
problem. What force ﬁeld does connect constituents of the Dirac particle? Is it
possible to separate these constituents as single particles? The direct interaction
between the remote constituents seems to be incompatible with the relativity prin-
ciples. It means that we are to introduce gluons or some other bearers of interaction
between the constituents. But even in this case it is rather diﬃcult to understand,
why the distance between the constituents is ﬁxed at any state of the dynamic
system.

We shall see that the only solution of this problem is the geometrical interpre-

tation instead of the dynamical one.

7 Geometrical model of the classical Dirac

particle

We explain what is the geometrical interpretation in the example of a classical
pointlike particle. Its motion is described by its world line

L
i = 0, 1, 2, 3

(7.1)

:

L

xi = xi (τ ) ,

25

where τ is a real parameter along the world line. According to the principles of
relativity the world line (WL) is a physical object, whereas the particle (pointlike
object in 3-space) is an attribute of WL. We shall use abbreviation WL (instead of
world line), when we want to stress that the world line is a physical object, but not
an attribute of a particle (its history). WL is not a completely geometrical object,
because it contains a non-geometric parameter: mass m. To make WL to be a
geometrical object we are to geometrize the mass. We make this as follows.

Instead of WL (7.1) we consider the broken line

one to use coordinateless description, when all geometric objects and all relations
between them are expressed in terms of the world function σ. This method of
description is referred to as the σ-immanent description.
It is convenient in the
sense, that a transition from one geoemetry to another one is carried out by means
of a change of the world function σ.

The condition (7.10) is slighter, than the condition (7.9), but it is interesting in the
sense, that lhs of (7.10) describes ”discrete derivative” of the cosine of the angle
between the adjacent links. According to (7.10) this cosine is constant, besides,
according to (7.9) this cosine is equal to 1.

Another form of the conditions (7.9) can be obtained, if we use the deﬁnition of

We can conclude from (7.11) as well as from (7.9), that for the free particle the
broken line (7.2) is a timelike straight line.

The pure geometrical description is useful in the sense that quantum eﬀects can
be taken into account by means of a simple change of the space-time geometry.
We declare that the real space-time geometry is the Minkowskian geometry only
approximately. The real space-time geometry is determined by the world function

geometry.

27

The geometry of the distorted space-time Vd is nondegenerate in the sense, that
any link
T[PiPi+1], determined by the relation (7.3) is a 3-dimensional surface (hollow
tube) with the characteristic width √d. (See fugure 1). If d
0 the tube degener-
ates to a segment of the one-dimensional straight line. Such a situation is connected
with the fact that the deﬁnition (7.9) of parallelism is one equation. This equation
determines the set of vectors PiPi+1, which are parallel to the ﬁxed vector Pi−1Pi,
as a set of points Pi+1, which satisfy the equation (7.9). In general, this set is a
three-dimensional surface, which degenerates into a one-dimensional line in the case
of the Minkowski geometry and timelike vector Pi−1Pi. As a result position of the
Gd appears to be indeﬁnite, even if the position of points Pi−1 and Pi
point Pi+1 in
is ﬁxed. The shape of world tube
Tbr appears to be stochastic. The stochasticity
intensity depends on the length µ of the link. The shorter the length, the larger is
stochasticity, because the characteristic wobble angle is of the order √d/µ. If we set

(7.13)

where ¯h is the quantum constant, c is the speed of the light, and b is the universal
constant, deﬁned by the relation (7.6), the statistical description of stochastic WLs
leads to the quantum description (in terms of the Schr¨odinger, or Klein-Gordon
equation) [18, 21].

Note that the statistical description of stochastic WLs leads to a more general
description, than the quantum description. The quantum description is only the
simpler part of the statistical description, which can be reduced to linear diﬀerential
equations for the wave function. The remaining part of the statistical description,
which is not reduced to linear diﬀerential equations, has not been investigated, in
general.

Thus, the world line of a particle without structure is the geometrical object,
T[PiPi+1]. But, maybe, there

At the geometrical description it is useless to ask, why world lines

T2 of
constituents interact at a distance and why there are no bearers of the ”geometri-
cal interaction”. In general, it is useless to explain geometrical facts by means of
dynamics, because the geometry is more primary and fundamental, than any dy-
namics. At the geometrical description any discussion of the dynamical conﬁnement
problems becomes to be useless. We cannot say deﬁnitely, whether the broken tube
(7.14) describes a geometrical coupling of two constituents, describing by (7.15), or
it describes a chain of more complicated geometrical objects (triangles). See the left
diagram ”dragon” in ﬁgure 2. Two versions ”dragon” and ”ladder’ distinguish only
in their internal geometric couplings, although the characteristic points Pi, Qi are
the same in both diagrams.

The ”ladder” is a two-dimensional band in the space-time, which may be re-
garded as a world tube of a one-dimensional open-ended rotating string. We see
that the geometrical model of the Dirac particle opens the door for such notions of
the elementary particle theory as string, conﬁnement, quark.

Note that the line segment

T[PiPi+1] is the simplest geometrical object, determined
by two points, the triangle
T[PiPi+1Qi] is the simplest geometrical object, determined
by three points, and the tetrahedron
T[PiPi+1QiRi] is the simplest geometrical object,
described by four points. If the chain of the line segments
T[PiPi+1] is associated with
the spinless particle, the chain of triangles
T[PiPi+1Qi] is associated with the Dirac

particle, we should expect that there exist the chain of tetrahedrons
Such a chain would be associated with the particles, constructed of three quarks,
because such a chain is associated with the composite particle, consisting of three
constituents. Compare diagrams ”dragon” and ”ladder” in ﬁgure 3.

Now we formulate mathematically constraints on links of the broken tube (7.14).
For simplicity, we consider the case of three-dimensional space-time. In this case
mathematical constraints are more simple and demonstrative. Note that the helix
axis is directed along the vector PiQi.

Thus, relations (7.16), (7.17), (7.21) and (7.23) are conditions of the geometrical
description of the classical Dirac particle. We can return from them to dynamic
description. If we replace the Minkowski world function in relations (7.16), (7.17),
(7.21) and (7.23) by the world function (7.12), (7.13), we obtain stochastic world
tubes (7.14). Introducing statistical description of the stochastic world tubes, we
obtain some version of the quantum description. Does this description coincide with
the description in terms of the Dirac equation? Maybe, but it is not necessarily.
There are some reasons for such a hesitation. In the case of the spinless particle,
described by the world tube (7.2), the statistical description leads to a more general
description, than the conventional quantum description in terms of the Schr¨odinger
equation. The quantum description is only a special part of the general statistical
description. Second, we cannot be sure, that helices (5.33) can be obtained only at
the conditions (7.16), (7.21) and (7.23). Maybe, there are another conditions, which
lead to the helices (5.33).

Nevertheless, the approach, founded on the a choice of the proper space-time
geometry and proper geometrical objects as candidates for descriptions of elementary
particles seems to be rather promising. In this case we do not use enigmatic quantum

32

principles, we do not invent exotic properties of particles and of space-time. We do
not invent new hypotheses, we simply look for the proper space-time geometry,
and the proper geometrical objects in the set of known geometries and in the set
of geometrical objects with known properties. Unfortunately, we cannot restrict
ourselves by consideration of the space-time geometry, because now we are able to
construct a statistical description only in the framework of dynamics (but not in the
framework of geometry). Nevertheless, such a dynamical problem as conﬁnement
does not arise, if we start from geometry.

The long-range action is another problem of the relativistic rotator. This is also

a dynamical problem, which is absent in the geometrical model.

The relations (7.17), and conditions (7.21), describing that all links (triangles)

must be similar seem to be rather reasonable.

In this paper we have investigated well-known dynamic system

SD. We used
methods of the model conception of quantum phenomena (MCQP) [23]. We did not
used any additional suppositions. Furthermore, we have removed all quantum prin-
ciples and have not use them in our investigations. Results of investigation of the
well-known dynamic system
SD appeared to be unexpected and encouraging. We
have came to the approach, containing a series of notions of the contemporary ele-
mentary particles such as string, quark, conﬁnement. Appearance of these concepts
is not connected with any additional hypotheses. It is rather reasonable, because
their appearance is connected with such a fundamental structure as the space-time
geometry.

Why have we obtain these results, which could not be obtained on the basis of
the quantum principles? The answer is rather unexpected. Conventional theory
of physical phenomena in microcosm contains mistakes, which are compensated
by means of the quantum principles. MCQP these mistakes are corrected, and
there is no necessity to compensate them. The quantum principles became to be
unnecessary. As a result the theory of the microcosm phenomena and its methods
become simple and reasonable.

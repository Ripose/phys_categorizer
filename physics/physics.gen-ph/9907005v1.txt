We show that the quantum superluminal communication based on the quantum nonlocal inﬂuence
must exist if a basic principle of science is still valid, which states that if we have demonstrated the
existence of something real, we can conﬁrm its existence.

After having shown quantum superluminal communication, if exists, does not result in the causal loop [1], we will
further demonstrate that quantum superluminal communication must exist due to the validity of a basic principle of
science, which states that if we have demonstrated the existence of something real, we can conﬁrm its existence.

At ﬁrst, as we have demonstrated [1], the existence of quantum nonlocal inﬂuence requires that there must exist a
preferred Lorentz frame for consistently describing the quantum nonlocal process, or we will meet logical contradiction
in our explanation about the experimental results about such process, this conclusion is independent of the existence
of the reality behind the process.

Then, according to a basic principle of science, which states that if we have demonstrated the existence of something
real, we can conﬁrm its existence, since we have demonstrated the existence of the preferred Lorentz frame we can
ﬁnd it. This principle is the only assumption in our demonstrations, and one impressive example of its validity is the
existence of atom.

At last, we will demonstrate that in order to conﬁrm the existence of the preferred Lorentz frame quantum superlu-
minal signalling or communication must exist, ﬁrst, as we have analyzed [1], in order to respect special relativity, the
existence of the preferred Lorentz frame, which is only required by the quantum nonlocal process, will only inﬂuence
the time orders of the correlating quantum nonlocal events as in one Bell experiment, namely in such a preferred
Lorentz frame the above correlating quantum nonlocal events are simultaneous, while in other inertial frames they
are not simultaneous, thus in order to conﬁrm or ﬁnd the existence of the preferred Lorentz frame, we need to identify
the time orders of the correlating quantum nonlocal events in diﬀerent inertial frames, as to one Bell experiment
this requires that we can distinguish the change of the measured single state due to the quantum nonlocal inﬂuence
in quantum measurement in order to identify the time order of the change, then this further means that we can
distinguish the nonorthogonal single state, such as ψ1 + ψ2 and ψ1, which can be easily used to achieve the quantum
superluminal communication, thus we demonstrate that in order to conﬁrm the existence of the preferred Lorentz
frame quantum superluminal communication must exist.

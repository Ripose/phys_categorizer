ON THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE
OF A MASSIVE STAR

ANGELO LOINGER AND TIZIANA MARSICO

Abstract. The celebrated treatment of continued gravitational col-
lapse by Oppenheimer and Snyder is revisited and emended from some
inherent ﬂaws. The star contracts itself into a material point, not into
a black hole.

1.– The gravitational spherically-symmetric collapse of a massive (i.e., of
mass greater than a few solar masses) star, simply described as “dust” clus-
ter of a spherical shape (with negligible pressure), has been ﬁrstly investi-
gated in 1939 by Oppenheimer and Snyder [1], whose approach is now a
standard reference [2]. However, treatments [1] and [2] are not exempt from
conceptual ﬂaws, and therefore the problem deserves a re-examination.

2.– The above mentioned collapse is described with the same mathematical
formalism of one of Friedmann’s cosmological models, and precisely the os-
cillating model in its contraction phase. Friedmann’s universe – as it is well
known – consists of a spherical “dust” cluster of “point” galaxies interact-
ing only gravitationally, and it is based on the principle of homogeneity and
isotropy of the three-dimensional space, according to which at any instant
of time it is seen similarly by all galactic observers [3].

First of all, we remember that for a dust cluster of particles, which interact

only gravitationally, the world lines of the particles are geodesic lines.

Quite generally, in a Gaussian-normal (or synchronous) frame of reference

– for which

(1)

g00 = 1 ;

g0α = 0

;

(α = 1, 2, 3) −,

the time lines are geodesic lines. Quite generally, in a co-moving frame of

reference the world lines coincide with the the time lines.

Accordingly, if we choose for our dust cluster (our star) a Gaussian-normal
frame S, the time lines of the particles are both geodesic and world lines –
and the frame S is also a co-moving one. We have:

Their solution describes a periodic oscillation between F = 0 and a given

tational ﬁeld is singular. Starting from Fmax our star contracts itself, in a
ﬁnite time, into a material point corresponding to F = 0.

κρ = 0 .

3.– In the Newtonian model analogous to the relativistic model of sect.2.,
a particle on the spherical surface of radius ℜ(t) of the star is attracted by
the mass M within the sphere according to Newton’s law:

They give a periodic oscillation between ℜ = 0 and a given ℜmax. Starting
from ℜmax the star contracts itself into a material point (for which ρ = ∞)
corresponding to ℜ = 0.

Remark, in conclusion, that: i) in both cases – Einsteinian Friedmann’s
model and Newtonian model – we have employed only one co-ordinate frame;
ii) the gravitational ﬁeld outside the star has caused no problem, and it has
been ignored.

4.– The approach by Oppenheimer and Snyder ([1], [2]) can be criticized for
the following reasons: i) the consideration of the Einsteinian ﬁeld outside
the star is a useless superfetation, because the Gaussian-normal frame of
FRW-metric characterizes exhaustively the phenomenon of collapse; ii) in
[1], [2] the external gravitational ﬁeld is described by the standard form of
solution of the Schwarzschild problem – erroneously called “Schwarzschild
solution” [4] –, which is properly valid only for the values of radial co-ordinate
r greater than κM/(4π).

At any rate, if one wishes to take into consideration also the outside ﬁeld,

it is suitable to proceed as follows.

As it is well known, the necessary and suﬃcient condition that a Riemann-
Einstein manifold admit the group of spatial rotations is that its ds2 be
reducible to the following form, which holds both internally and externally
to the matter distribution:

ANGELO LOINGER AND TIZIANA MARSICO

By virtue of a famous Birkhoﬀ ’s theorem, the outside ﬁeld is time-
independent, and consequently the general form of external metric is given
by the following formula, as it was emphasized by Eddington [5]:

here: m ≡ κM/(8π), and f (r) is any regular function of r. No physical

result depends on the choice of f (r).

If we put

(18)

(19)

(20)

we obtain the form of solution ﬁrst investigated by M. Brillouin [6], which

holds for r > 0. Putting

f (r) ≡

+ (2m)

,

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

f (r) ≡ r

,

we obtain the original form of solution given by Schwarzschild [7], which
is valid for r > 0; thus, Schwarzschild’s and Brillouin’s forms are maximally
extended. If we put simply

we obtain the standard, or Hilbert-Droste-Weyl, form of solution, which
holds only for r > 2m. Remark that Brillouin’s form and Schwarzschild’s
original form are diﬀeomorphic to the exterior part r > 2m of HDW-form.
Within the singular locus r = 2m of this last form the time co-ordinate
t takes the role of the radial co-ordinate r, and vice-versa. The solution
loses its physical Eigentlichkeit (“appropriateness”, according to Hilbertian
terminology), and becomes further non-static. Consequently, the notion of
black hole – the “globe” r = 2m – is destitute of any meaning. As all the
Fathers of Relativity perfectly knew!
Conclusion. Take ideally an instantaneous photograph of the contracting
sphere at any time t, and call r its co-ordinate radius at this time. If we
choose the regular function f (r) of Eddington’s formula (17) so that the
corresponding form of solution be valid for r > 0, we can say: since t is just
any time and r tends to zero, at the ﬁnal stage of its contraction our star will
become a point mass. Thus, also with this schematic, model-independent,
consideration we see that no celestial body can convert itself into a black
hole.

APPENDIX A

From the experimental standpoint we can aﬃrm that no black hole (BH)
has ever been detected. Indeed, an accurate scrutiny of the papers in which
observational discoveries of stellar-mass, or of supermassive, BH’s are cried
up, shows that in reality the authors have discovered only celestial bodies of
large, or enormously large, masses concentrated in very small volumes [8].

It is interesting to read the comments of Wolfgang Kundt, a renowned
astrophysicist, concerning the BH’s [9]. He does not criticize the current the-
oretical viewpoint on the question, but limits himself to signiﬁcant remarks
of the following kind.

α) Page 37 of [9]: “The critical mass [...] which determines whether a star
eventually turns into a white dwarf or something more compact – if such
a mass is well deﬁned – is [...] controversial. It should be consistent with
(i) the birthrate of white dwarfs, (ii) the birthrate of neutron stars, (iii) the
PN [planetary nebula] rate, (iv) the SN [supernova] rate, (v) the supernova
remnant (SNR) rate, and (vi) the initial mass function (IMF) which counts
the number of stars as a function of their mass at birth. In view of the many
neutron stars in the Galaxy – detected as pulsars, binary X-ray sources, or
even invisible (when screened, without accreting) – I favour a critical mass of
some 5 solar masses (over larger values, like 8 solar masses). The bias would
become even more severe if a large number of massive stars would end up as
black holes (BHs); in my own judgment, none of the BH candidates (BHCs)
do involve BHs, rather they are neutron stars surrounded by massive disks
[...]: The proposed BHCs have too much spectral and variability structure,
reminiscent of a rotating inclined magnet at their center [...].”

β) Page 81 of [9]: “Another disk peculiarity is expected at the centers of
galaxies [...] The galaxy feeds an active, nuclear-burning nucleus, a burning
disk [Kundt, 2000]. – Instead, most of my colleagues prefer to think of a
supermassive black hole as the central engine of all the active galactic nuclei
(AGN). They have not convinced me, after more than 20 years. AGN activ-
ity requires a reﬁlling engine, with nuclear burning, magnetic reconnections,
and explosive ejections of the ashes [...]. Black-hole formation would require
distinctly higher mass concentrations than are even reached in galactic nu-
clei, by a factor of 102. The quasar phenomenon is a simple consequence of
a permanent inward galactic mass ﬂow, at an average of < 1 (or ∼ 1) solar
mass per year, which piles up at the center.”

γ) Page 101 and 102 of [9]: “How about stellar-mass holes? [...] Over 45
black-hole candidates have been proposed during the past 30 years from the
class of binary X-ray sources, both high-mass and low-mass – among them
Cyg X-1 and A0620-00 – on account of their large mass function, absence
of strict periodicities, and absence of type-I bursts (understood as nuclear
detonations at neutron-star surfaces). To me, all of them look like neutron
stars surrounded by massive ( ≈5 solar masses) accretion disks, because of
their often hard spectra (up into the γ-ray range), highly structured, [...]
and because of their indistinguishable further properties, as a class, from all
the established neutron-star binaries [...]. They just ﬁll the gap between the
high-mass and low-mass compact binary systems. – And the postulated su-
permassive black holes at the centers of (all the active) galaxies? They were
once believed to be required for energy reasons. The nuclear burning (of H
to Fe) is almost as eﬃcient a lamp as black-hole accretion, yielding a garan-
teed < 1% (or ∼ 1%) of the rest energy [...]. Besides,[...] the universality
of the jet phenomenon suggests a universal engine which we know is a fast
rotating magnet in the cases of newly forming stars, binary neutron stars,
I share the
and forming binary white dwarfs [Kundt, 1996, 2000]. – [...]

doubts of a few other people, among them (the late) Viktor Ambartsumyan
and Hoyle et al.
[...].
Active galactic nuclei may owe their extreme properties to those of their
central disks.”

[2000], in the widely accepted black-hole paradigm.

δ) Pages 131 and 132 of [9]: “As already mentioned [...], [see supra in γ)],
the list of stellar-mass black-hole candidates contains presently over 45 en-
tries, ﬁve of them with high-mass companions (> 6 (or ∼ 6) solar masses),
the rest with low-mass ones (< 2 (or ∼ 2) solar masses). Their deﬁning
property is a mass in excess of 3 solar masses of their compact component.
All the high-mass BHCs are persistent sources whereas most of the low-
mass ones are transient, with recurrence times of decades. Every year, two
or more X-ray novae joint the list. [...]. – My suspicion of the BH interpre-
tation comes from (i) a number of spectral and lightcurve properties which
require a hard surface, an oblique magnetic dipole, and two dense, interact-
ing windzones; (ii) the indistinguishability, as a class, of the BHCs from the
neutron-star binaries in all properties other than their inferred mass; and
(iii) the missing intermediate-mass systems which should naturally evolve
into neutron-star binaries with massive disks. [...]. – Among the long list of
remarkable properties in which the BHCs are indistinguishable, as a class,
from neutron-star binaries are (j) the presence of a third (precessional) pe-
riod of several months, 294 d in the case of Cyg X-1; (jj) a hard-soft state
spectral bimodality, pivoting around 6 keV, and extending up to MeV; (jjj)
their ﬂickering, expressed by their X-ray power spectra which range from
mHz to > kHz (or ∼ kHz) and show various quasi-periods, in particular of
several 102Hz, up to 1.2 kHz, reminiscent of innermost Kepler periods, of
a spin period, and/or of beat frequencies thereof; (jv) their jet-formation
capability [...].” –

APPENDIX B

Perhaps the belief of most of the theoretical astrophysicists in the physical
existence of BH’s begins now to get cracked. We report below the abstract
of a recent paper by Frønsdal [10], an author who anticipated in 1959 [11]
the celebrated result by Kruskal [12] and Szekeres [13], which contributed
so much to the conviction of the real existence of the BH’s.

Here is the mentioned abstract [10]: “This paper studies the interpretation
of physics near a Schwarzschild black hole. A scenario for creation and
growth is proposed that avoids the conundrum of information loss. In this
picture the horizon recedes as it is approached and has no physical reality.
Radiation is likely to occur, but it cannot be predicted.”

(Of course, with the phrase “Schwarzschild black hole” the author de-
notes the ﬁctive object derived from the current unphysical interpretation
of the part r ≤ 2m of the standard HDW-form of solution of Schwarzschild
problem – as we have previously emphasized; and “horizon” denotes in this
interpretation the singular locus r = 2m.)

Accordingly, the observational astrophysicists are warned: the existence
of the black holes cannot be detected – exactly as the existence of cosmic
ether.

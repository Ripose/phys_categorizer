Abstract

It is considered the procedure of deﬁnition of the elements of length and time by
means of photon. In order to deﬁne the element of length one needs an a priori given
element of time. In order to deﬁne the element of time one needs an a priori given
element of length. It is taken the laboratory time and length as a priori given time
and length respectively. It is deﬁned the elements of length and time for the reference
frame moving with the velocity v and for the reference frame with the gravitational
potential Φ.

The elements of length and time can be deﬁned by means of photon. Given the element

of time t, one can deﬁne the element of length as a path covered by photon for the time t

l = ct.

(1)

Given the element of length l, one can deﬁne the element of time as a duration required for
photon to cover the distance l

t =

From this it follows that in order to deﬁne the element of length by means of photon one
needs an a priori given element of time. It is natural to take the laboratory time as an a
priori given time. In order to deﬁne the element of time by means of photon one needs an a
priori given element of length. It is natural to take the laboratory element of length as an a
priori given element of length.

Take two reference frames and deﬁne the elements of length and time by means of photon
moving from the second frame to the ﬁrst frame. Let the ﬁrst frame be the laboratory one.
Take the time of the ﬁrst frame as an a priori given time. Consider the case when the
velocities and gravity in the second frame are negligible v ≪ c, Φ ≪ c2. Photon moving
from the second frame to the ﬁrst frame deﬁnes an euclidean element of length

l = ct.

(3)

Consider the case when the second frame moves with the velocity v in the direction
perpendicular to the direction towards the ﬁrst frame. Photon emitted by the second frame
possesses the component of velocity v in the direction of the motion of the second frame. In
the direction towards the ﬁrst frame, photon possesses the component of velocity

Formulas (5), (6) resemble the Lorentz reduction of length and retardation of time as
in the special theory of relativity [1]. However in the approach under consideration these
formulas have another interpretation. In the special theory of relativity t and l are the proper
elements of time and length in the moving frame, t′ and l′ are the laboratory elements of time
and length in the rest frame. In the approach under consideration t and l are the laboratory
elements of time and length in the rest frame, t′ and l′ are the elements of time and length
in the moving frame from the point of view of the rest frame. Here the notions of the proper
elements of time and length are absent. The time and length from the point of view of the
laboratory frame have the physical meaning.

The reduction of length (5) and the retardation of time (6) is a consequence of that the
velocity of photon in the moving frame decreases from the point of view of the rest frame.
From this it follows that one cannot simultaneously deﬁne the elements t′ and l′. While
using the laboratory time t, one can deﬁne the length l′, and vice versa while using the
laboratory length l, one can deﬁne the time t′. In the special theory of relativity it is used
either the laboratory time in the rest frame and the proper length in the moving frame or the
laboratory length in the rest frame and the proper time in the moving frame. Therefore in
spite of the diﬀerent interpretation the approach under consideration yields the same results
as the special theory of relativity.

Let the second reference frame possess the gravitational potential Φ. This case is equiva-
lent to that when the second frame moves with the velocity v in the direction perpendicular
to the direction towards the ﬁrst frame. Photon emitted by the second frame possesses the
component of eﬀective velocity v in the direction perpendicular to the direction towards the
ﬁrst frame

v = √2Φ.

The reduction of length (9) and the retardation of time (10) correspond to those in the
general theory of relativity [1] given by the Schwarzschild metric for the spherical symmetry
gravitational ﬁeld where l corresponds to the radial coordinate r, the gravitational potential
is given by Φ = GM/r. However in the approach under consideration these formulas have
another interpretation. In the general theory of relativity t and l are the proper elements
of time and length in the frame with potential Φ, t′ and l′ are the laboratory elements of
time and length in the remote frame. In the approach under consideration t and l are the
laboratory elements of time and length in the remote frame, t′ and l′ are the elements of
time and length in the frame with potential Φ from the point of view of the remote frame.
Similar to the case with the moving frame the notions of the proper elements of time and
length are absent.

The reduction of length (9) and the retardation of time (10) is a consequence of that
the velocity of photon in the frame with potential Φ decreases from the point of view of the
remote frame. From this it follows that one cannot simultaneously deﬁne the elements t′ and
l′. While using the laboratory time t, one can deﬁne the length l′, and vice versa while using
the laboratory length l, one can deﬁne the time t′. In the linear general theory of relativity
it is used either the laboratory time in the remote frame and the proper length in the frame
with potential Φ or the laboratory length in the remote frame and the proper time in the
frame with potential Φ. Therefore in spite of the diﬀerent interpretation the approach under
consideration yields the same results as the linear general theory of relativity.

The results yielded in the approach under consideration are diﬀerent from those in the
non-linear general theory of relativity. In particular in the non-linear general theory of rela-
tivity the physical velocity of photon in the radial direction is deﬁned by the proper elements
of length and time and is equal to the constant c. In the approach under consideration the
physical velocity of photon in the radial direction is deﬁned from the point of view of the
laboratory frame (remote frame) via the laboratory time t and the reduced length r′ or via
the laboratory length r and the retarded time t′

c′ =

When the radial coordinate reachs the Schwarzschild radius r → rg = 2GM/c2, the veloc-
ity of photon in the radial direction tends to zero c′ → 0. From this it follows that the
Schwarzschild radius is the limiting one.

Abstrat

We show in this note how many eletron irreduible representations

of the Lorentz group L an be expressed in terms of Slater determinants.

In this way the full on(cid:28)guration wave funtion of Quantum Chemistry

is derived without any appeal to the Shrodinger equation and Born-

Oppenheimer approximation.

In partiular the number nof exhange-

orrelations between the orbiting eletrons and those in the neutrons may

be alulated and therefore the ground state eletron exhange-orrelation

energy E readily obtained by dividing the atomi energies by n. Com-
parison with measured atomi energies yields values of E very lose to
-1 hartrees for the 3 neutral atoms Be, B and C . This tallies within a
few perent with the best available E estimates. Although alulations

were performed for 3 atoms the method is perfetly general and an be

applied to any atom. However beause E is estimated for metals only,

gases are not onsidered in this paper. The intimate relationship with

density funtion theory is disussed in the onlusion.

1 Introdution

Many years ago the many eletron problem was modelled by irreduible repre-

sentations of the Pauli ring found by onstruting the minimal left ideals [1℄.

Then when a (cid:28)eld was introdued by (cid:28)bration the well known spin angular

momentum matries appeared. The minimal left ideals are the bra vetors of a

density operator ψ [2℄, so the method is in fat a density funtion formulation as
well as a representation of the two-dimensional unitary group U2 and therefore
of a subgroup of the proper orthohronous homogeneous Lorentz group Lp . In

this paper the many eletron ase will be extended to the nuleus by onsidering

the neutron to be a proton plus an eletron so a neutral atom is envisaged as

1

an ensemble of A protons and A eletrons distributed between N neutrons and

A-N orbiting eletrons. Under these onditions the omplex angular momentum

matrix is [3℄.

γ = EN ⊗ γP + γN ⊗ EP

(1)

Where γP , γN are (P +1)−and (N +1)−dimensional Lie operators of SO (3) and
EP , EN are (P + 1) and (N + 1) unit matries. However the nett eletron spins

must also be mathed with the spin of the nulear ground state even though the

spins may be orthogonal and therefore not additive.

Aording to this senario the exhange energy of interation responsible for

atomi energies will be between the P outer eletrons and the P eletrons within
the nuleus and thus the number of interations will be of the order of P 2

unless

they our simultaneously.

It will be seen that this is indeed supported by

experimental evidene. Furhermore a preferred spin orbital ψe will be found for

the olletive motions of the orbiting eletrons.

In order to atually alulate the number of exhange-orrelations assoiated

with ψe it is neessary to integrate, by exponentiation, the representation of
the Lie algebra u2 haraterising the eletroni spin state mathing the nulear

ground state. When this is done, by means of a matrix exponential theorem,

the Slater determinants inorporating exhange orrelations emerge naturally.

To illustrate the method, whih is quite general, we will begin with

9Be and then
12C whih belong to another spae beause A is
even. Spei(cid:28)ally the bosons (even A) are haraterised by Eulidean struture

10B and

in Setion 3 go on to

while the fermions belong to omplex manifolds.

2 BERYLLIUM-9

Aording to de Wet [1℄ the many eletron on(cid:28)guration deomposes into the

sum

CλPλ of pro jetion operators Pλ haraterising the spin state [A − λ, λ]
and oe(cid:30)ients Cλ whih are polynomials in γ of equation (1) and may be

P

determined by the reurrene formula:

(n + 1) Cn+1 = γCn + (A − (n − 1)) Cn−1 , n ≥ 1, A > (n − 1)

where

γ = C1 = En ⊗ γP + γN ⊗ EP , C0 = 1

is related to the usual spin matries by γ = 2is. Thus we (cid:28)nd

n = 1, C2 = 1

P + (γ3

N + 25γN ) ⊗ E4

(2b)

when A=9. Here C3 de(cid:28)nes the spin state

3
2 orresponding to 6 eletrons with

positive spin and 3 with negative spin, thus mathing the spin of the ground

state of

9Be nuleus where P=4, N=5. In this way the eletroni and nuleon

spins are linked even though their spins may be orthogonal and therefore not

additive.

If we use the diagonal representations

iγP = {4; 2; 0; −2; −4}, iγN = {5; 3; 1; −1; −3; −5}

(3)

then C3 an easily be obtained from (2b). Half the values appear in Table I;

the remainder are repeated with a hange of sign.

After symmetrization, by interhanging rows and olumns, X is found to have

the eigenvalues of Table I whih label its 15 rows, and we will assume from

symmetry onsiderations that X77 orresponds to the eigenvalues

whih is the

same as the lowest non-zero olletive eigenvalue due to 4 spinning protons and

5 spinning neutrons obtained by the method outlined in [4]. This orresponds to

identifying the 3 lowest non-zero eigenvalues of

C3

and the high eigenvalue 10.5i with the olletive motion of the 4 orbital eletrons.

Equation (7n ) is a Slater determinant of the possible orbits, exluding the state

funtion (6) are the matrix powers [µr]ik whih depend on the state [k℄ and the

spins and rotations assoiated with k.

Returning to (6) the sin term is haraterised by odd powers of µ and belongs

Comparing (9) with the full on(cid:28)guration interation wave funtion proposed

by Szabo and Ostlund ([5℄, Ch. 2) the oe(cid:30)ients of the sine terms are integral

exhange orrelations up to a normalization onstant (whih at least ensures

that one eigenvalue of the set assumes the value of unity as required by the

theorem).

In partiular the spin orbital sin( 21

2 θ) assoiated with the 4 orbiting eletrons

would have 15 exhange orrelations whih would be approximately the ase if all

exhanges between these eletrons and 4 in the nuleus oured independently

implying 16 exhanges. Johnson et al.[6℄ list -14.6674 hartrees for the measured

exhange-orrelation energy of Be whih yields an exhange-orrelation energy

per eletron of -14.6674/15=-0.9778 hartrees. In the next setion (Table II) this

value will be ompared with the best available estimate given by the formula of

Gell-Mann and Bruekner [7℄.

orresponding to a spin state 1, with the degenerate eigenvalue

λ = {210; 42; 10; 2; −14}

whih in terms of the theorem have to be normalised so that 1 eigenvalue is

unity and all eigenvalues are positive. To do this we add λt = 14 and divide by
λf = 16 to (cid:28)nd the positive anonial form

µ = (C4 + 14)/16 = {14; 3.5; 1.5; 1; 0}

The onstant λt will translate the spetrum beause if AX = λX , then

(A − λt)X = (λ − λt)X

And after exponentiation will multiply the wave funtion by a fator eiλtθ
On the other hand λf may be absorbed in θ and simply lead to a irrelevant
hange in frequeny that will not a(cid:27)et the oe(cid:30)ients Fk(µ)/Fk(λk) of the

.

wave funtion (10) whih are independant of whih eigenvalue is normalised.

Also the zero in (12a) ontributes nothing to the wave funtion and the theorem

ounts degenerate eigenvalues only one.

The 36×36 matrix µ deomposes into two bisymmetri diagonal 18×18 matries

of whih only one gives the required eigenvalues (12a). By symmetry we hoose

µ99 = 41

16 as the matrix element orresponding to the ground state and then

using (10) (cid:28)nd a unitary wave funtion

256ψ99 = exp( 14

16 θ){74 sin θ + 38 sin 3

2 θ + 50 sin 7

2 θ + 25 sin 14θ},

(13)

Again there is a high frequeny spin orbital sin 14θ assoiated with the 5 orbiting

eletrons with 25 exhange orrelations yielding an exhange orrelation energy

per eletron of −24.6539/25 = −0.9862 hartrees using the results of [6℄.

Finally the oherent eletron oe(cid:30)ient orresponding to a zero spin state of C

720C6 = γ6 + 140γ4 + 4144λ2 + 14400

and µ = 1 − C6/84, has the degenerate eigenvalues

dψ99/dθ|θ=0 = 41

is

{12; 4

3 ; 1; 16

21 ; 0}

belonging to a 24 × 24 bisymmetri matrix with µ12,12 = 211/84 labelling the

ground state in whih (10) yields a wave funtion

256ψ12,12 = sin θ{39 sin 16

In this example whih is not a metal, it would seem that there is an ele-

tron exhange shared by the adjaent state sin 4

3 θ suh that the total number

of exhange orrelations assoiated with the outer orbitals remains onstant at

26.5 + 37.5 = 64. If we assume that the largest negative exhange orrelation

energy is favoured then the exhange orrelation energy per eletron will be

−37.8450/38 = −0.9959 hartrees.

We will onlude this setion with a omparison of the exat ground state or-

relation exhange energies with those derived by Gell-Mann and Bruekner for

4 Conlusion

Aording to Biedenharn and Louk [2℄, Setion 7.7 this work is, in fat, a

density funtional formalism beause the wave funtion

by a left ideal and (10) has the form of a general density matrix beause if

λkFk(µ)/µFk(λk) is idempotent then so is Fk(µ)/Fk(λk) sine Fk(µ) vanishes
unless µ = k . The use of density matries to desribe anonial ensembles

has been detailed by Prigogine [8℄. In fat the idempotent matries are Slater

CλPλ is generated

P

determinants and prinipal minors whih desribe pure or oherent states, so

one is looking at nett many partile behaviour instead of attempting to build

this up from the interation of individual partiles. Spei(cid:28)ally we have the

partition

7

into the two states of a anonial ensemble namely; (A − λ) eletrons with pos-
itive spin and λ eletrons with negative spin as it is possible that very light

elements suh as Li may only be approximated. The intimate onnetion be-

tween statistis and idempoteny was atually reognised long ago by Eddington

(A − λ) + λ = A

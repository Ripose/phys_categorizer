Nonlinear Theory of Fields

Abstract

−

Suggested modiﬁcation of the Einstein-Maxwell system, such that Maxwell
equations become non-gauge and nonlinear. The theory is based on assump-
l2AaAb,
tion that observable (i.e., felt by particles) metric is ˜gab = gab
where gab is metric (found from Einstein equations), Aa is electromagnetic
potential, and l is fundamental constant of the theory. The idea, that mass
and charge densities of elementary particles could be functions of electromag-
netic potential and background metric only is accepted, and speciﬁc model of
the densities is considered. As a result, one obtains solutions corresponding
to quantized electrical charge with spectrum qn = 2n
e,
where n = 0, 1, 2, ... Theory predicts Coulomb interaction between electrical
charges and masses. Namely, if (m, e) and (m′, e′) describe masses and elec-
trical charges of two particles respectively, then energy of interaction (in non-
κ(em′+e′m)]/r. It follows, then, that
kmm′−
relativistic limit) is V (r) = [ee′−
the Earth’s mass, ME, contributes negative electrical charge, QE =
κME,
which explains why primary cosmic rays consist mainly of positively charged
particles. Attributing the fairweather electric ﬁeld at the Earth’s surface to
the charge QE, one obtains an estimate κ > 10−

I. FIELD EQUATIONS

It’s a widely known fact, that development of fundamental theories goes in direction: lin-

ear theory

nonlinear theory. General Relativity is one example of the statement; after its

→

creation Einstein and others tried to unify both gravity and electrodynamics on geometrical

basis, and their eﬀorts resulted in nonlinear equations describing electromagnetism. Born-

Infeld theories, originating from [1], and later reconsidered in frames of the string theory [7],

are nonlinear, too [2–6,12,13]. This paper, based on [14,15], suggests yet another approach

to nonlinear theory of ﬁelds.

Consider ﬁelds (gab, ˜Aa) in four-dimensional spacetime, where gab is metric, and ˜Aa = lAa

is (dimensionless) electromagnetic potential. Here Aa is the potential in standard units,

and l is a fundamental constant of the theory. One may consider nonlinear and non-gauge

modiﬁcation of the electromagnetic theory, such that Einstein-Hilbert action term for metric

gab remains valid, and linearized part of electromagnetic theory is gauge invariant. The

generalized Einstein-Maxwell equations,

II. NON-RELATIVISTIC LIMIT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY

In non-relativistic limit one may neglect terms of order v

c , where v denotes characteristic

speed of matter. Take background metric, gab = diag(1,

Then equations (1.2) are equivalent to

here ∆ denotes the Laplacian. One may write down a class of solutions, corresponding to

the charge distributions, J 0,

Here phase, ϕ(xa), corresponds to Coulomb potential of the linear theory, generated by

charges j0 = cos [lϕ(xa) + ψ] J 0, and ψ is a constant of integration. Since the observable

˜A0(xa) = sin [lϕ(xa) + ψ] .

Consider solution for a point-like charge, e, in spherical coordinates, xa = (cτ, r, θ, φ),

According to (3.2), one may ascribe to the charge e its contribution to gravitational mass,

which creates corresponding Newtonian potential, found from ˜g00. Here k is Newtonian

constant. From (2.7) follows, that the mass, m, contributes to observable electrical charge,

IV. QUANTIZING THE CHARGE

Quantization of electrical charge takes place in many physical theories, describing elec-

tromagnetic phenomena (see e.g., [8,9]). In this theory quantizing of the charge will be done

as follows. To begin with, accept a model of a particle with density which is a continuous

function depending on ﬁeld variables only (i.e., on gab and ˜Aa):

µ2 + iµ1 =

(cid:17)

.

Here q, ν, and ψ are real constants; ˜g = det(˜gab) and g = det(gab). Assume that if densities

µ1,2(S) = 0 on a closed spatial surface S, then one may consider µ1,2 = 0 on exterior to S.

Consider ﬂat spacetime with spherically-symmetric electromagnetic potential, ˜Aa =

[sin Ψ(r), 0, 0, 0], generated by a particle at rest. The densities,

µ2 + iµ1 = 0 ; (r > R)

Substituting densities into equation (2.2), one obtains two equations for ˜Ψ = Ψ

ψ. (1)

R: ∆ ˜Ψ

= 0; (2) r > R: ∆ ˜Ψ+ = 0. Both solutions, ˜Ψ

and ˜Ψ+, should be sewn

The solutions, corresponding to ﬁnite densities at r = 0, are Ψ

three equations: (a) b =

(c) follow two cases: (i) a =

both cases n = 0, 1, 2... For the potential outside the particle, after substitution of the found

parameters, one obtains,

Here ˜A+1 and ˜A+2 correspond to two branches of exterior solutions. Assume, that the

asymptotic for both branches, (4.4) and (4.5), should be the same. Considering l−

1 tan ψ as

asymptotic of A+1 and A+2 on spatial inﬁnity, one may take C =

2π. Hence, one obtains

V. CONCLUSION

Due to the structure of solutions, the potential of a point-like charge behaves as tradi-

tional Coulomb on large distances, but changes its behavior while approaching the singular-

ity. Namely, for two charges, e1 and e2, (e1e2 < 0) there may exist an equilibrium (non-zero)

distance. To prove this, one ought to ﬁnd a two-point potential energy for both charges

(similar to asymptotics V (r1 −
from the stress-energy tensor, tb

r2) = e1e2/

r1 −
|
a, by integration of t0

r2|

in linear case), which could be calculated

0 over spatial volume. Doing so, one

would obtain the energy of ﬁelds as a function of distance between the charges. Putting this

problem aside, consider a simpliﬁed problem, when e1 =

e2 = e and ψ = 0. Then, the

Obtained solutions (4.6), (4.7) may suggest an explanation for the structure of nucleons.

Consider, for example, proton consisting of two quarks with charges 2

3 and one with charge

1
3 . One may imagine a linear structure, in which positively charged quarks are at ends,

−
and the negative one is in the middle. Suppose, for a moment, that interaction between

the charges is described with standard linear theory. Then, attraction between 2

stronger than repulsion between both 2

3, in which case both 2

3 would fall on

3 . Due to the

change of attraction into repulsion at r

charge, QE =

to observable negative charge explains, why primary cosmic rays consist mainly from posi-

tively charged particles [10]. The lower boundary of parameter κ may be estimated, if the

fairweather electric ﬁeld (100 Volts per metre at surface of the Earth) [11] is attributed to

charge QE. The estimate is κ > 10−

Harmonizing General Relativity with Quantum
Mechanics

Antonio Alfonso-Faus1

Abstract. Gravitation is the common underlying texture between General Relativity and Quantum
Mechanics. We take gravitation as the link that can make possible the marriage between these two
sciences. We use here the duality of Nature for gravitation: A continuous warped space, wave-like,
and a discrete quantum gas, particle-like, both coexistent and producing an equilibrium state in the
Universe. The result is a static, non expanding, spherical, unlimited and ﬁnite Universe, with no
cosmological constant and no dark energy. Macht’s Principle is reproduced here by the convergence
of the two cosmological equations of Einstein. From this a Mass Boom concept is born given by M
= t, M the mass of the Universe and t its age. Also a decreasing speed of light is the consequence of
the Mass Boom, c = 1/t, which explains the Supernovae Type Ia observations without the need of
expansion (nor, of course, accelerated expansion). Our Mass Boom model completely wipes out the
problems and paradoxes built in the Big Bang model, like the horizon, monopole, entropy, ﬂatness,
ﬁne tuning, etc. It also eliminates the need for inﬂation.

INTRODUCTION

Einstein’s effort to extend the validity of classical mechanics to velocities close to the
speed of light was very successful. He created Special Relativity and doing this he
liberated the limits imposed on Newtonian Mechanics: it was not applicable to the case
of bodies moving at a speed close to the speed of light. Later on he continued his effort
to include Gravitation in his ideas on relativity and created General Relativity, a very
successful effort too. By then mechanics was on its foot, valid for small as well as high
velocities, as compared with the speed of light. It was also valid for normal sizes, the
see and touch world around us, as well as very large sizes, as compared with the size
of the see able Universe. But a dilemma was still puzzling the scientiﬁc community.
Nature appeared to answer questions about its essence in accordance with the type of
experiment set up for these questions: Wave nature? Particle nature? Both answers were
afﬁrmative if the questions were put in the proper way. Then a dual nature was clear
for everybody: waves and particles were at the base of all Nature, both at the same
time. The theory that connected these two aspects of nature was Quantum Mechanics, a
wave theory and a particle theory (because Heisenberg uncertainty principle is built in
this wave theory) that extended the validity of mechanics to the small world of atoms

and fundamental particles, the Quantum world. Again, a big puzzle was still plaguing
science: General Relativity, a theory of continuous variables, had produced the two
cosmological equations to deal with the Universe as a whole. And Quantum Mechanics,
the wave and particle theory of Nature, appeared to explain the world satisfactorily. But,
what about Gravitation? Only a theory of the wave-type, General Relativity, dared to
treat it. No quantum treatment exists today that has a well developed theory to deal
with the problem of quantum gravity. One way to introduce a new approach to this
problem is to look at the cosmological equations and try to include the wave and particle
nature into them. General Relativity is clear; it is a geometrical view of gravitation where
curvature plays a central role. A curved space mechanically implies a centripetal force,
which is just the force of gravitation that gives an inward "push". And a gas of gravity
quanta implies an outward force, the gas pressure that in fact balances the inward push.
Hence we have here the picture of gravitation with a dual nature: Wave-like inward force
because of the curvature of space, and particle-like, outward force due to the gas pressure
of the gravity quanta.

EINSTEIN COSMOLOGICAL EQUATIONS

The Mass-Boom concept presented elsewhere [1] implies a decreasing speed of light c,
inversely proportional to cosmological time t. Then the product ct is a constant, and
this can be taken as the size of the Universe, constant, with no expansion [2]. The
cosmological scale factor R being constant drastically reduces the number of terms in
the cosmological equations (R′ = R′′ = 0). Also the Hubble "constant" H is zero in this
case, the same as the Lambda cosmological constant that equals (or is proportional to)
H. Then we are left with only two terms in each of the Einstein cosmological equations,
the pressure (density) term and the curvature term:

Both equations are reduced to just one if, and only if, the gravity quanta gas pressure

And using R = ct as the size of the Universe we arrive at

We can interpret this equation as a form of Mach’s principle if we enunciate it as
follows: The relativistic energy mc2 of any mass m is of the order of its gravitational
potential energy with respect to the mass M of the rest of the Universe:

The conclusion is that the two cosmological equations, which are at the base of the
General Relativity approach to any model of the Universe, are just Mach’s Principle.
This Principle is built in the Einstein’s ﬁeld equations,

THE MASS-BOOM

Presented elsewhere [1] is the idea that the Action Principle may be used to derive
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations if the factors in front of the integrals are constant:

The second equation is just a manifestation of the constancy of momentum. Then

from Mach Principle in the form in equation (6) we get:

in a certain system of units. This is the Mass-Boom: the equivalence of mass and time.
Hence one has

and one can take the size of the Universe R = ct as unity. The relation

explains [2] the Supernovae type Ia ﬁndings without the need of postulating any accel-
erating expansion of the Universe, nor the existence of dark energy (in fact the cosmo-
logical constant is also zero [3], and we are left with the initial static model of Einstein
that we now know is stable). In our model there is no horizon problem nor any of the
numerous problems built in the Big Bang theory which motivated the construction of
inﬂation theories.

A NEW COSMOLOGIAL MODEL WITH TIME-VARYING
"CONSTANTS"

The Hubble red shift was interpreted as an expansion of the Universe. Here we have a
Mass-Boom non-expanding model [4] and therefore we can interpret the red shift as an
effect of a shrinking Quantum world [5], atoms and fundamental particles, immersed in a
static, constant size Universe. This can be achieved by showing that Planck’s "constant"
h is proportional to the speed of light c.

If we impose the constancy of nuclear forces we get:

Also by imposing the constancy of electrical forces we have:

Abstract

It is argued that electron can be treated as an anyon which carries a charge (-

e) and a magnetic ﬂux

Φ0

±

magnetic ﬁeld. This ﬂux is shown to arise due to the spin of the electron.

The ﬂux associated with the electron spin is calculated using a semi-classical

model which is based on the magnetic top model. In accordance with spherical

top model it is assumed that the spin angular momentum of the electron is

produced by the ﬁctitious point charge (-e) rotating in a circular orbit. It is

shown that the ﬂux through the circular orbit is independent of the radius

I. INTRODUCTION

In two dimensional space, quantum particle, can exhibit a continuous range of statistics

interpolating between bosons and fermions [1–3]. Such exotic particles are called anyons and

they are believed to play a role in the Fractional Quantum Hall Eﬀect and, perhaps, even in

high-temperature superconductors [4]. Wilczek [2,3] showed that, each anyon is taken to be

a boson carrying a unit statistical magnetic ﬂux, Φ, concentrated at its location. When one

anyon circles once around another in an anti-clockwise sense; the wavefunction picks up a

Aharanov-Bohm phase: exp

exp(2iθ). The cases θ = 0, π

the particles being bosons, semions and fermions respectively [5]. Alternatively, we can take

the anyons to be fermions carrying a statistical ﬂux 2θ. Then θ = 0, π/2 and π correspond

to fermions, semions and bosons. The purpose of this note is to present that electron itself

may be considered as an anyon. Namely it carries a charge and a magnetic ﬂux associated

with its spin. We calculate the magnetic ﬂux associated with the electron’s spin using by

a semi-classical model which is based on the magnetic top model [6–8] that can be made

equivalent to a circular motion of a point charge in two dimensions. We show that the

magnetic ﬂux associated with electron spin is hc

2e for spin down electron and - hc

2e for spin up

one.

where J is the gauge invariant kinetic angular momentum. This conserved canonical angular

momentum Jc has a conventional spectrum [9,10]: its eigenvalues are always integers in units

of ~. The diﬀerence between Jc and J is due to presence of the magnetic ﬂux, and hence

the magnetic ﬁeld B. Both in the absence and in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld B, the

canonical angular momentum is always represented by the quantum mechanical operator:

Jc =

where ϕ is the polar angle on x-y plane.

which states that the spectrum of J consists of integers shifted by eΦ

for m=0. We believe that this non-zero contributions to the kinetic angular momentum

comes from spinning motion of the electron. In the following part we calculate the magnetic

ﬂux associated with the electron’s spin using by a semi-classical model which is based on

the magnetic top model [6–8] that can be made equivalent to a circular current loop. Our

calculations gives that magnetic ﬂux associated with electron spin is hc

2e for a spin down

electron and - hc

2e for spin up one.

As clearly stated by Barut et al [8] the magnetic top is an adequate model of quantum

spin, because the magnetic moment performs a simple precession around the magnetic ﬁeld

4

(10)

(11)

(12)

although the top itself performs a complicated motion. it was also shown that by canonical

and Schr¨odinger quantization, Pauli theory of spin was obtained. In the magnetic top model

the electron is assumed to be a small sphere with the radius re and the spin of the electron

is assumed to be produced by the electron’s rotation about itself with an angular frequency

ωs. Our model [11] is based on the magnetic top model which can be made equivalent to

a circular current loop with the radius R in x-y plane. It will be shown that as far as the

ﬂux is concerned the radius R of this loop is a phenomenal concept and it gets eliminated in

the end. In this model the electron motion is considered in two parts namely an ”external”

motion which can be interpreted as the motion of the center of mass (and hence the central

of charge) and an ”internal” one whose average disappears in the calssical limit. The latter

is caused by the spin of the electron. The important thing is that although the average of

the internal motion disappears the average of the ﬂux associated with the internal motion

does not.

In accordance with the magnetic top model, we assume that the spin angular

momentum of the electron is produced by the ﬁctitious point charge (-e) rotating in a

circular orbit with radius R and with the same angular frequency ωs. It can be shown that

the present calculations can be generalized to any kind of spherical charge distribution for

electron. The details of the charge distribution determines the relation between the radius

re of the electron and the radius R of the current loop. Further it is important to note that

electron’s spinning frequency ωs is very high compared to the cyclotron frequency ωc (for
B=5x103 Gauss, ωs ≈
the cyclotron period Tc = 2π

1015ωc ). As was shown in Eq.(6) for calculation of the magnetic ﬂux

ωc is the important time interval. During the cyclotron period Tc,

electron completes only one turn around its cyclotron orbit, but it spins ( ωs

ωc >> 1) times

about itself. Although the radius of the electron ( and hence the radius of the loop) is very

small, because of the rapid spinning, the total ﬂux during the cyclotron period, Tc will be

comperable with the ﬂux quantum, Φ = hc

e . We will see that the total ﬂux associated with

the spin is exactly

Eq.(26) states that the ﬂux associated with the electron spin is independent of the radius

of circular loop ( ∝ the radius of the electron) and the mass of the electron. The (+) sign

stands for spin down electron and (-) sign for spin up one.

Next we want to calculate the ﬁrst terms of Eq.(20) and (21) in terms of the ﬂux

quantum. To do so we look at the Schr¨odinger equation for an electron in the presence of

the uniform magnetic ﬁeld −→B = B

It is tempting to think that this proportionality is valid even in the presence of spin (ie. in

the presence of Zeeman term in the energy). So in the presence of spin the additional Zeeman

So far we have considered only the ﬂux associated with the external magnetic ﬁeld.

However even in the absence of the external ﬁeld, because of its spin, electron will create

and carry a magnetic ﬂux with itself. In accordance with the magnetic top model, we can

take the spin vector in z direction then the magnetic ﬁeld lines associated with the spin

magnetic moment, −→µ e will be as in Fig.1a.

Outside the current loop the magnetic vector potantial −→A e of the spin magnetic moment

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have calculated the magnetic ﬂux associated with the electron spin to show that

electron itself can be treated as an anyon. Our model is based on the magnetic top model

which can be made equivalent to a circular current loop with radius R. As far as the ﬂux

is concerned the radius R of this loop is a phenomenal concept and is eliminated in the

end. We distinguish the spin angular frequency, ωs from the cyclotron angular frequency

ωc = eB

mc (ωs >> ωc). It is shown that the calculation of the ﬂux is led to a time integral. The

crucial point is that, the limits of time is taken from zero to cyclotron period, Tc. During

the cyclotron period Tc, electron completes one turn around the cyclotron orbit, but it spins

(ωs/ωc) times about itself. Although the radius of the electron is very small, because of the

12

rapid spinning, the total ﬂux associated with the electron spin is comparable with the ﬂux

quantum. As far as the ﬂux is concerned the mass of the electron is a parameter which

is eliminated in the end. Therefore whether we take the relativistic mass or not the result

does not change (to go from Eq.(22) to (26) we do not put any restriction on the electronic

mass). Namely the ﬂux is

hc
2e . It can be shown that the present calculations can

Φ0

be generalize to any spherical charge distribution for electron. The details of the charge

distribution determines the relation between the radius of the electron re and the radius R

of the equivalent current loop. For a uniform charge distribution the magnetic moment of
the spinning electron is found to be µ = eωsr2
5c

if we compare this with Eq.(24), the relation

e

between R and re becomes: R =

2
5 re. We believe that the present study will bring a

q

new insight to understand the area of physics which concerns the magnetic ﬂux. A more

complete report will be given in future.

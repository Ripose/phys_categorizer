K-calculus in 4-dimensional optics

Jos´e B. Almeida∗

Abstract

4-dimensional optics is based on the use 4-dimensional movement space,
resulting from the consideration of the usual 3-dimensional coordinates com-
plemented by proper time. The paper uses the established K-calculus to make
a parallel derivation of special relativity and 4-dimensional optics, allowing
a real possibility of comparison between the two theories. The signiﬁcance
of proper time coordinate is given special attention and its deﬁnition is made
very clear in terms of just send and receive instants of radar pulses. The
4-dimensional optics equivalent to relativistic Lorentz transformations is re-
viewed.

Special relativity and 4-dimensional optics are also compared in terms
of Lagrangian deﬁnition of worldlines and movement Hamiltonian. The ﬁ-
nal section of the paper discusses simultaneity through the solution of a two
particle head-on collision problem. It is shown that a very simple graphical
construction automatically solves energy and momentum conservation when
the observer is located at the collision position. A further discussion of the
representation for a distant observer further clariﬁes how simultaneity is ac-
commodated by 4DO.

Keywords: K-calculus; alternative theories; 4-dimensional optics; special
relativity.

Introduction

In recent times the author has written several papers on the subject of his proposed
alternative to general relativity, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] all of them rejected by the journals
to which they were submitted; refs. [1] and [2] were accepted as posters in confer-
ences. The main reason for rejection can be found in the words of one referee:

The foundation of the author’s model is inconsistent with SR (spe-
cial relativity). In particular, he gives no compelling reason why we
should abandon SR which is a highly successful theory. Just to turn
to an alternative speculation since, according to the author, SR is too
complicated, is no sufﬁcient reason. Therefore I have no option but to
suggest to the editor of the . . . to reject this paper.

One should therefore ask why any effort should be made to set up an alternative
to an existing theory that has proven so successful. There are at least two reasons
to do so: In the ﬁrst place any theory is just as good as the predictions it allows for
observable phenomena and if two competing theories allow the same predictions
they are equally good until some phenomenon is better predicted by one of them.
Until one is proven better than the other, the coexistence of the two theories allows
different perspectives which can only enhance our understanding of the underlying
physics. Secondly general relativity has failed to explain properly a number of
phenomena, see for instance [6], while people keep trying to merge it with the
other main physical theory, the standard model. This suggests that there may be
some other theory that uniﬁes everything, the most successful so far being string
theory [7].

The ﬁeld is wide open for new ideas that combine the best of general relativity
and the standard model, proving capable of predictions as accurate as those pro-
vided by these two theories but somehow having an entirely different approach.
One must always keep in mind that any model or theory is just a representation of
reality and not reality itself, the latter being rather difﬁcult to deﬁne without re-
sorting to the observer’s own perception. In the present paper the author adopts an
approach to his theory based on the K-calculus by Herman Bondi [8], which has
been so successful in introducing relativity to undergraduates all over the world.
In his previous works the author used a different approach and he hopes that this
effort may render the theory more acceptable to those that have difﬁculty accept-
ing that there may be alternatives to relativity. Furthermore there issues related to
simultaneity which have not been addressed so far and are clariﬁed in the present
work.

The coordinate system used in 4-dimensional optics, henceforth referred to
as 4DO, differs from the relativistic space-time in complementing the 3 spatial
coordinates (x1 = x, x2 = y, x3 = z) with a 0th coordinate (x0 = τ ) such that
time becomes a measure of geodesic arc length in Euclidean space. Using the usual
simpliﬁcation of making c = 1,

This equation is valid on tangent space only; for the more general situation of
curved space the deﬁnition is extended as

2
(dt)

= gαβdxαdxβ,

with gαβ the movement metric, rather than the space metric as in general relativity
[4, 5].

Understanding the meaning of coordinate τ is crucial for proper handling of
the theory in the most general situations, so it was felt necessary to develop the
basic theory in a way similar to what is usually used to introduce relativity in
undergraduate courses, thereby giving the reader a good means for assessing the
similarities and differences between the two theories. The author chooses to follow
an introductory path closely similar to what was introduced by Bondi [8] and later
used by other authors, namely Martin [9] and D’Inverno [10]. For an observer
traveling at speed v, Bondi introduced the K factor

K =

c + v
v

which has since been used to identify this approach as K-calculus.

It is useful to remember that in 4DO the speed as we see it, what will be desig-
nated by 3-speed, is actually the 3-dimensional component of a 4-vector with the
magnitude of the speed of light. This was ﬁrst explained in an introductory work
by the author [1] and later developed in the works cited previously. This approach
ensures that 3-speed is bound by the speed of light without resorting to hyperbolic
space, as is the case in relativity. Besides, it has been shown that 4DO holds the
potential for explaining physical processes which relativity has failed to account
for satisfactorily.

2 Coordinate deﬁnition

Bondi resorts to imaginary radar pulses bouncing on a distant observer and a clock
for the deﬁnition of space and time coordinates. The idea is that the observer ﬁxed
on the laboratory frame investigates the space around him with the help of radar
pulses and a clock. When a radar pulse is sent the observer records the send instant
τ1 and when the echo is received from some location in space the observer records
the receive instant τ3 and the direction angles θ and φ; the reﬂection instant τ2
is inaccessible to the observer. The direction angles provide two of the position
coordinates; remembering that the speed of light is set to unity, the third position
coordinate is the distance to the reﬂecting object

r =

τ3

τ1

(4)

K-calculus in4-dimensional optics

The time coordinate is naturally given by

t =

τ3 + τ1
2

.

τ = τ2.

Conversely 4DO replaces the time coordinate with a coordinate deﬁned by the

reﬂection instant

The locus of an observer’s points in either space is said to deﬁne the observer’s
worldline in that particular space. The graphical representation of 4-dimensional
spaces is difﬁcult, so it is usual to suppress two spatial dimensions in order to repre-
sent a 2-dimensional section of the space or to suppress one spatial dimension and
project the resulting 3-dimensional section on the plane as a perspective diagram;
this paper uses mainly the 2-dimensional section representation.

Suppose now an observer moving with uniform velocity v in the laboratory
frame. This observer’s worldline is a straight line on both systems and for conve-
nience it can be assumed that it passes through the coordinate origin. In 2 dimen-
sions the observer’s worldline has an equation x = vt; using Eqs. (4, 5) one can
write

which leads to the relation

Two inertial observers A and B are now considered, the latter moving with ve-
locity v relative to A. Fig. 1 shows the Minkowski space-time worldlines of the two
observers as two straight lines diverging from the origin. The origin placement at
the point of intersection of the two worldlines does not represent any limitation on
the problem conditions. At instant τ0 observer A launches a radar pulse which is
bounced back and forth successively between the two observers. The radar pulse
moves at the speed of light with respect to both observers so, in observer A’s frame
1, respec-
its worldline is a broken line with alternating segments of slope +1 and
−
tively. The radar pulses worldlines follow the general equation t =
x + τ2m−2,
with m integer.

Observe that the K-factor is the same for both observers and so it is possible

to write Eq. (8) generally as

τn−1 = τn−1K 2.

relative velocity v with respect to observer A. Observer A launches a radar pulse at
instant τ0, which bounces back and forth between the two observers.

The last equation deﬁnes recursively a succession of general term

τn = τ0K n.

τn = √τn+1τn−1.

It is now possible to use Eq. (11) as an alternative to Eq. (6) for the deﬁnition

of the τ coordinate

Comparing with Eq. (5) it becomes clear that while Minkowski space-time deﬁnes
time as the arithmetic mean between the send and receive instants, 4DO uses a
coordinate deﬁned as the geometric mean between the same instants for τ . This
coordinate will be designated proper time in view of its relationship with the simi-
larly designated quantity in relativistic theory [4].

Eq. (5) can be used to relate tn and τn eliminating τn+1 and τn−1 from the

following three equations:

τn = Kτn−1, τn+1 = Kτn, tn =

τn+1 + τn−1

Figure 2: In optical space the observers move with velocity c across 4-dimensional
space and time is measured along the worldline.

Eqs. (12 or 13) allow the construction of a graphic representation for the two
observers’ 4DO worldlines using coordinates x, τ . Observer A’s worldline is drawn
as the τ axis, because this observer does not move in his own frame. For observer
B it is sufﬁcient to plot the successive pairs (xn, τn) and join them by a straight
line; B worldline’s slope is τn/xn and considering Eq. (13) it is easily seen that
this slope is given by γ/v. Obviously light and radar pulses have v = 1 and must
be represented by horizontal lines of zero slope.

The ﬁnal graph is shown in Fig. 2 but the interaction between radar pulses and
observers needs some explanation. When the two observers leave the origin they
have synchronous clocks; time, however, is then evaluated separately over each
observer’s worldline. When A launches the ﬁrst radar pulse, at instant τ0, the pulse
is synchronous with A’s clock and evaluates time over it’s own worldline. The
pulse’s time is compared with B’s own time at every point along the way; only
when they coincide can interaction occur and this happens beyond the crossing
point of the two worldlines on the graph. On B’s frame the interaction instant t1
is translated into the proper time τ1; this is represented by a dashed vertical line
joining the pulse’s and B’s worldlines.

The reﬂected pulse must suffer a similar process, only the roles of observers
A and B are now interchanged. The dashed lines representing the reﬂected pulses
at τ1 and τ3 must not be mistaken by these pulses worldlines, because they are the
representation of worldlines on B’s frame. On A’s frame the instants τ1 and τ3 are

K-calculus in4-dimensional optics

inaccessible and the pulses actually return at τ2 and τ4, respectively.

From Eqs. (13 and 14) it is clear that τn, vtn and tn are the sides of a rectangular

triangle. Remembering that xn = vtn, it is possible to write

t2 = τ 2 + x2.

The subscripts have been suppressed because the relation most hold for pulses sent
out irrespective of the particular initial instant τ0.

A simple geometrical construction can be used to plot the points of the moving
observer’s worldline, Fig. 3. If a radar pulse is sent at τo and its reﬂection is re-

ceived at τ2, a circle is drawn with diameter τ2
τ0 and, according to Eq. (4), the
moving observer is at a distance x1 equal to the circle radius. Considering Eq. (5)
the time t1 for the moving observer is equal to the distance from the origin to the
center of the circle. A new circle is now drawn with center at the origin and radius
equal to the value of t1, in order to transport this value to the moving observer’s
position. The value of coordinate τ1 is automatically found by the intersection of
the second circle with the vertical line at position x1. The same process can then
be repeated for all the pairs of sent, received pulses.

by direct replacement of τ1 and τ3 from Eqs. (16) it is possible to conclude that
τA = τB = τ2, i. e. the proper time coordinate is independent of the inertial
observer’s own speed, as long as its worldline passes through the origin. This
conclusion can be seen as equivalent to interval invariance in Minkowski space-
time [9] .

The representation of Fig. 4 b) shows how the situation discussed above ap-
pears in 4DO space. The outgoing pulse at τ0 is detected by observer B at τ1 and

Eqs. (18) mean that the quantity t2 can be evaluated as τ 2 + x2 by any observer
whose worldline passes by the origin. If the problem is given a more general for-
mulation, in 4 dimensions and without the restriction of the worldlines having to
cross at the origin, it can be said that

2

= δαβdxαdxβ,

which is equivalent to saying that time is a measure of geodesic arc length in Eu-
clidean 4DO space.

The important results are then: 4DO space is Euclidean, with time intervals
being measured over the worldline of the observer.
In a change of coordinates
from one observer to a different one, which is in motion relative to the former, time
intervals are not preserved but rather proper time intervals.

In Minkowski space-time it is well known that the interval is preserved in co-

ordinate transformations and is given by [9, 10]

Eqs (18 and 20) provide the rules for elementary displacement transforma-
tion when changing from one space to the other. Assume that the vector dx ¯α is
expressed in Minkowski space-time and must be transformed to 4DO space; the
transformation rule is

It is possible to deﬁne the 4-velocity for an observer in the two spaces as
˙xα = dxα/dt and ˙x ¯α = dx ¯α/dt, respectively, with the t derivatives taken over
the worldline. The 4-velocity transformation between the two spaces follows rules
similar to those expressed by Eqs. (23, 24) with dx ¯α and dxα replaced by ˙x ¯α and
xα.

4 Lorentz equivalent transformations

The subject of this paragraph has already been considered in [4] but needs to be re-
viewed here for completeness. Our approach to coordinate transformation between
observers moving relative to each other is different from special relativity; while
in the latter case the interval is given by Eq. (20), thus ensuring that a coordinate
transformation preserves the interval and affects both spatial and time coordinates,
our option of making time intervals measure geodesic arc length gives time a mean-
ing independent of any coordinate transformation. We thus propose that Lorentz
equivalent transformations between a ”ﬁxed” or ”laboratory” frame and a moving
frame are a combination of two simultaneous processes. The ﬁrst process is a ten-
sorial coordinate transformation, which changes the coordinates keeping the origin
ﬁxed, with no inﬂuence in the way time is measured, while the second process
corresponds to a ”jump” into the moving frame, changing the metric but not the
coordinates.

It has been established in page 6 that photons follow worldlines of dτ = 0
and carry the value of the τ coordinate across the Universe, which was conﬁrmed
in page 8 by the veriﬁcation that proper time intervals were independent of the
observer. On the other hand the time interval must also evaluate to the same value
on all coordinate systems of the same frame, due to its deﬁnition as interval of 4DO
space.

One can consider observers O and ¯O, the latter moving along one geodesic
of O’s coordinate system, as depicted in Fig. 5. Let the geodesic equation have a
parametric equation xα′
(t). The aim is to to ﬁnd a coordinate transformation tensor
α = ∂x¯µ/∂xα; it has already

The metric given by the previous equation will evaluate time in ¯O’s coordinates
in a frame which is ﬁxed relative to O, that is, this is still time as measured by
observer O. Observer ¯O will measure time intervals d¯t in his own frame and so,
although the coordinates are the same as they were in O’s frame, time is evaluated
with the Kronecker metric δ¯µ¯ν instead of metric given by Eq. (28). Mathematically
the metric replacement corresponds to the identity

δ¯α ¯β = (g¯µ¯ν)

−1 g¯µ¯ν.

(29)

It was said in page 10 that the transition from the laboratory frame to a mov-
ing observer’s frame was the result of two separate processes, one of which was
responsible for the change of coordinates and the other one for the time change.
The ﬁrst process can now be identiﬁed with a coordinate change governed by the
α, while the second one involves multiplication of the metric by g ¯µ¯ν. The
tensor Λ¯µ
second process is intrinsically separate from the ﬁrst one and was used in [4, 5] to
derive the Lorentz force due to a moving charge and the center of mass equivalent
of an orbiting mass.

4.1 Time contraction for a moving observer

Eq. (18) established that time intervals should be measured by the arc length of
an observer’s worldline. Recalling Fig. 5, the time measured for observer ¯O’s
trajectory in the laboratory frame of observer O is given by dt = γdτ , according
to Eq. (13). Observer ¯O is at rest in his own frame and sees his frame axes normal
to each other, i.e. he uses the Kronecker metric, and so he measures for himself a
time interval d¯t = dτ . Obviously d¯t < dt and so we say that the time measured
by a moving observer runs slower than the time measured on the laboratory frame.
At this point it is useful to give physical meaning to the coordinate τ , so that
4DO is understood as a space with physical signiﬁcance. This space is designed to
represent the movement of observers through 3-dimensional space. Accordingly it
uses the standard coordinates to identify the observers’ positions, eventually scaled
by the observers’ masses as described in Refs. [4, 5]. The 0th coordinate τ does

K-calculus in4-dimensional optics

13

not have a Universal meaning, as was shown in the previous paragraph; it is just
the time indicated by the observers’ own clocks and so it does deserve to be called
proper time. The fact that coordinate τ can be identiﬁed with each observer’s own
time is of no consequence for the representation of his own worldline but becomes
important when two observers interact, for then time must evaluate to the same
value when both observers’ worldlines are represented in a common frame. The
problems of interaction between observers and the concept of simultaneity will be
dealt with in paragraph 7.

4.2 The twin paradox in optical space

It is customary to discuss the case of two twins A and B, of which A stays at
home, remaining inertial at all times, while B goes on an extended space ﬂight at
high speed before he eventually joins A back home. The reasoning is that as B’s
time is constantly running slower than A’s, B must come back younger than A.

In 4DO the argument is inconsistent because one must distinguish between the
time measurements on the frames of the two twins. In fact B’s time measured on
his own frame is shorter than his time measured by A on the ﬁxed frame. On the
other hand B’s time measured by himself is exactly the same as A’s time mea-
sured on the ﬁxed frame and the two twins actually grow old together. A proper
discussion of this problem should not ignore the fact that B’s frame is necessarily
accelerated and this has also an inﬂuence on the way clocks run.

It can be shown that the geodesic equations are equivalent in Minkowski and
optical spaces. For this one chooses arc length as parameter in both spaces and
derives the geodesic equations starting from the Lagrangean.

Eqs. (34, 35) were both derived from the Lagrangeans and state the basic rela-
tionship between time and proper time that had been established before. It is then
clear that both spaces are equally adequate for derivation of the geodesic equations.
Although the geodesic equations are the same in both spaces the Lagrangeans
are not equivalent; when t is used as parameter in Eq. (30) the Minkowski La-

6 Hamiltonian and particle energy

The Hamiltonian of a system is a function of coordinates, conjugate momenta and
a parameter, that describes the system evolution in phase space. Phase space as-
sociated with 4-dimensional coordinate space should then be 9-dimensional.
In
classical mechanics one is usually led to use time as parameter, thus eliminating
two dimensions in phase space. What follows compares phase spaces associated
with 2-dimensional sections of Minkowski and 4DO spaces.

It has been established that the Lagrangean must be unity when expressed in

terms of the arc length so the action in Minkowski space-time is

ds = δ

(dt)2

(dx)2 = δ

and the Hamiltonian

Eq. (41) justiﬁes the statement that a unit mass body’s energy is given by
1/γ
and quite naturally, if the body has mass m one says that the energy increases
proportionally.

Looking at 4DO space one can perform a similar derivation; the action is now

It is tempting to see the fact that HM = HO as a conﬁrmation that both spaces
are equivalent for the study of a body’s movement. This is actually not quite true!

The difference between Eqs. (46) and (47) exists only when γ is time depen-
dent; this happens if the velocity is varying not only in direction but also in magni-
tude. In fact the problem only arises because a potential was considered but it has
been stated already [4] that 4DO precludes potentials and considers all interactions
to be dealt with through space curvature and associated metric modiﬁcation. The
problem is then ill-posed; nevertheless the predictions of general relativity will not
be coincident with 4DO’s whenever the former theory appeals to potentials.

7 Conservation law and simultaneity

Understanding the physical meaning of proper time is important if one wishes to
acquire the feeling of the physical phenomena that are expressed in optical space.
One is used to the concept of simultaneity and the discussion in section 3 has
already shown that this concept is not easily translated into the new space; the
following lines discuss a typical problem involving simultaneity, which hopefully
will clarify this point. A collision situation is as good as one can get to discuss
simultaneity, with the bonus that it will bring conservation into the picture.

First of all it will be admitted that for some fortunate reason the coordinate
origin coincides exactly with the collision point, so that the simultaneity problem
is solved automatically. Two particles are to be considered, a and b, with position
vectors in 2D optical space given by

ra = (τa, xa) , rb = (τb, xb) .

with ma, mb the masses of particles a and b, respectively. Notice that coordinate
scaling of the particles’ coordinates by their respective masses cannot be used in
graphical representations, although it is useful for mathematical calculations, as
explained in Refs. [4, 5].

Momentum conservation implies that at any position along x the sum of the
two momenta must be preserved; in particular at x = 0 one can write the two
equations

The length of the particles momenta stay unaltered by the collision; only their
directions are changed. Fig. (6) exempliﬁes a collision situation. The addition of
the momenta pa + pb gives the total momentum that must stay unaltered by the
collision. The length of individual momenta must also be preserved because the
particles’ masses don’t change. The construction shows the only other way that

The problem was analyzed from the point of view of an observer standing at the
collision position. When represented on a distant observer’s frame, the particles’
worldlines no longer intersect at the collision position, as shown in Fig. 7 where
x0 and x1 are the collision and observer’s positions, respectively. The collision
instant τ is the time measured along each of the four different worldlines. The
geometrical construction on the ﬁgure is such that circles 1, 2 and 3 have centers
on the intersection of the observer’s worldline, at x1 with the worldlines b, a and b′,

respectively. The circle associated with a′ worldline is not shown. All the circles
cross x1 at a common point τ , ensuring that each circle’s radius is exactly the time
that mediates between the instant of the associated worldline passing at x1 and the
collision instant. The point of intersection of each circle with the vertical line at x0
marks the point of passage of the associated worldline by this position. The dotted
lines meeting at x0 represent the situation depicted on Fig. 6 and clearly highlight
the difﬁculty in representing simultaneous events on distant observers’ frames.

8 Conclusions

4DO has been shown in previous work to be a viable alternative to general rel-
ativity, being able to produce identical predictions in most observable situations
but offering reasonable explanations for phenomena that Einstein’s theory has not
been able to accommodate comfortably. Furthermore, 4DO shows prospects of
being compatible with standard theory, paving the ground for a uniﬁed theory of
Physics, which has so far been the realm of string theory.

4DO is based on the use 4-dimensional movement space, resulting from the
consideration of the usual 3-dimensional coordinates complemented by proper
time. The physical meaning of this space is not intuitive and the present paper

uses the established K-calculus to make a parallel derivation of special relativity
and 4DO, allowing a real possibility of comparison between the two theories. The
signiﬁcance of the proper time coordinate is given special attention and its deﬁni-
tion is made very clear in terms of just send and receive instants of radar pulses.

Special relativity and 4DO are also compared in terms of Lagrangian deﬁnition
of worldlines and movement Hamiltonian. The ﬁnal section of the paper discusses
simultaneity through the solution of a two particle head-on collision problem. It is
shown that a very simple graphical construction automatically solves energy and
momentum conservation when the observer is located at the collision position. A
further discussion of the representation for a distant observer further clariﬁes how
simultaneity is accommodated by 4DO.

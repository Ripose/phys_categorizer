The Holistic Universe and the Variation of the
Fine Structure Constant

Abstract

Inaba recently used a simple model to suggest that Quantum The-
ory can result from a ﬂuctuation in the cosmos. In this note we conﬁrm
this conclusion from a diﬀerent and more general point of view. We
then argue that this provides an explanation for the recently observed
variation of the ﬁne structure constant.

1 Introduction

Recently Inaba [1] has argued that a ﬂuctuation in the Robertson-Walker
geometry yields a random motion for a particle in the universe, which latter
is equivalent to the usual Quantum Theory. He argues that this may be
suggestive of a manifestation of Mach’s principle. Inaba’s simple model is
based on the work of Santamoto [2, 3, 4, 5], who tried to give a geometrical
interpretation for Quantum Theory. The object of the present note is to
conﬁrm this result, from a diﬀerent and more general viewpoint, namely, in
terms of ﬂuctuations in the universe.

2 Fluctuations

We ﬁrst observe that it is not surprising that Quantum Theory should be the
eﬀect of ﬂuctuations in the universe as a whole. In fact as pointed out [6, 7, 8],
the ﬂuctuation in the mass of a typical elementary particle, for example the
1080 is given
pion, due to the ﬂuctuation

where T is the age of the universe and R its radius, which equals cT .
Not only is the right side of equation (1) the reduced Planck constant ¯h, in
the order of magnitude sense, but also equation (1) itself is an expression of
the Uncertainity relation

Equation (1) again suggests the origin of Quantum Theory in cosmic ﬂuctu-
ations.
Before proceeding it is worth mentioning that the above line of reasoning
leads to a cosmology which deduces from theory all the supposedly mirac-
ulously coincidental large number relations of Dirac as also the empirical
inexplicable Weinberg formula which relates the mass of the elementary par-
ticle, the pion to large scale parameters like the Hubble Constant [9, 10],

The cosmological scheme is also consistent with the subsequent discovery
that not only is the universe not decelerating but is actually accelerating and
will expand for ever [11, 12, 7, 8].
Inaba deduces for a nearly ﬂat Robertson-Walker universe from a minimum
average curvature principle, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a single parti-
cle,

Schrodinger equation

Inaba then argues that (3) is indeed the Quantum Mechanical equation in
the classical Robertson-Walker geometry - it is the perturbation R′ in the
Robertson-Walker geometry that lead to (3).
We can justify the above conclusion as follows: We ﬁrst observe that in the
random motion of N particles, l the ﬂuctuation in the length is given by

tion given by x(t) subject to random corrections is given by the well known
equation

son’s derivation, arrive at the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (2) and thence the

rationale to the otherwise adhoc identiﬁcation in Nelsonian theory viz.,

ν = ¯h/m

Thus using the equations of Brownian Motion in the context of all the par-
ticles in the universe, we arrive at the same equations (2) and (3) of Inaba
based on a minimum curvature principle and Santamoto’s geometric Quan-
tum Mechanics.
Infact one can look upon the above results in terms of the ﬂuctuation of the
metric itself. In Santamoto’s original formulation [2, 3, 4, 5], the geometry
is Weyl’s guage invariant geometry, where there is no invariant length and
infact we have

δl2

It must be stressed that (6) is valid for arbitrary vectors Aı, in which case l
would be their length.
Using the usual geometrodynamic formula for the ﬂuctuation of the metric[16],
we have

where lP is the Planck length.
Whence we get

l2δgık ≈

∆gık ≈

δgık ∼

if l is of the order 10−11cm or the electron Compton wavelength.
Similarly using (4) in (6), we recover (8), as in the Weyl geometry.
This establishes the equivalence of the two approaches and reconﬁrms the
Machian feature, from a more general viewpoint.

3 The Fine Structure Constant

In the Weyl geometry considered above, or in a more general scheme of a
non commutative geometry[17, 18] we have equations like (6), (7) and (8).
What they show is that at the Compton wavelength l, the variation of length
δl is the Planck length, the absolute minimum length; in this sense l is the
minimum physical length (Cf.refs.[7, 8]and [10]).
We now observe that, in the above spirit if we consider the gravitational
potential energy of the particle as its inertial energy, we get

In (9) if N = 1 and r
the Planck length, then we get the Planck mass.

If N
of the radius of the universe, we get the mass of an
elementary particle like the electron. Thus it is the presence of N particles
that leads to electromagnetism. If N = 1, then we would be at the Planck
mass and Planck length. Indeed as can be seen from (1), in this case the
Compton wavelength of such a Planck particle would equal its schwarzschild
radius and electromagnetism and gravitation would become one (Cf.refs.[7]
and [19]): electromagnetism would disappear.
Let us now examine the above situation in the light of the ﬂuctuational cos-
mology model (Cf.ref.[7, 18] and [12]). In this model √N particles are ﬂuc-
tuationally created within the minimum Compton scale time, and as noted
in Section 2 this leads to a consistent explanation of several otherwise adhoc
features as also the recently observed acceleration of the universe. It then

On the other hand the Compton wavelength leads to a correction in the elec-
trostatic potential experienced by an orbiting electron in an atom, similar to
the Darwin term[20]. Brieﬂy we have

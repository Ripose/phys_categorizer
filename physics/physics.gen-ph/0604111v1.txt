Abstract

It is proved the mathematical theorem, that the wave function describes
the statistical ensemble of particles, but not a single particle. Supposition,
that the wave function describes a single particle appears to be incompatible
with formalism of quantum mechanics. One discusses the reasons, why this
very simple statement has not been proved mathematically for many years.
The reason lies in application of the trial and error methods for construction
of the quantum mechanics. Application of this method as the main tool of
investigation during eighty years generated ”ﬁtting mentality” of all microwold
researchers.

In this paper we prove a very important theorem, which claims that the wave

statistical ensemble of quantum particles. We shall show, that the action AS for the
Schr¨odinger particle SS (the dynamic system described by the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion) turns into the action AE[Scl] for the statistical ensemble E [Scl] of free classical
particles Scl, when the quantum constant ~ → 0. Such a transition is possible only
in the case, when the wave function ψ describes a statistical ensemble of quantum
particles, but not a single particle.

For the free Schr¨odinger particle SS the action has the form

It is supposed that in the
classical limit ~ → 0 the description of the dynamic system SS becomes to be a
classical description of a free particle Scl.

However, there are two diﬀerent classical descriptions of the free classical particle

Scl. The individual classical particle Scl is described by the action

where x = {x1 (t) , x2 (t) , x3 (t)}.

(particles) of the statistical ensemble E [Scl]. Both dynamic systems Scl and E [Scl]
are classical. However, Scl has six degrees of freedom (the order of the system
of the ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerential equations), whereas the statistical ensemble
E [Scl] has inﬁnite number of the freedom degrees, because it consists of the inﬁnite
number of the particles Scl. To what classical dynamic system (Scl or E [Scl]) turns
the dynamic system SS in the limit ~ → 0?

The quantum constant ~ is a parameter of the dynamic system (1). As a rule,
a change of a parameter of a dynamic system does not change the number and
the character of dynamic equations. The number of the freedom degrees does not
changes also. The dynamic system SS has inﬁnite number of the freedom degrees,
and we should expect that at ~ → 0 the dynamic system SS turns into E [Scl], which
also has inﬁnite number of the freedom degrees, but not into Scl, which has six
degrees of freedom.

However, at ~ = 0 the description by means of the action (1) degenerates, and
one should consider the limit ~ → 0 of the description by means of the action (1).
To obtain this limit, we make a change of variables

ψ → Ψb = |ψ| exp

The transformation (4) is analytical for any values of parameters b and ~, except
for the case, when ℏ = 0 or b = 0. The constant b is arbitrary, and it always can
be chosen b 6= 0. The value ~ = 0 is not considered, because in this case the action
(1) is degenerate. For all values of ~ 6= 0 the dynamic systems (1) and (5) are

which is a partial case of the dynamic system (3). This statement will be proved.

But independently of, whether or not dynamic systems E ′ [Scl] and E [Scl] coin-
cide, the dynamic system (6) cannot coincide with the dynamic system (2), because
the dynamic system (2) has six degrees of freedom, whereas the dynamic system
(6) has inﬁnite number of the freedom degrees. It means that the wave function
may not describe a single particle, and the Copenhagen interpretation and other
QM interpretations, founded on the statement, that the wave function describes a
single particle, may not be used. In particular, such phenomena as superluminal
interaction in the EPR experiment and many-worlds interpretation [1, 2] appear
to be impossible as founded on the statement, that the wave function describes an
individual particle.

Discussion of paradoxes, connected with the quantum measurements began, as
soon as the quantum mechanics had appeared, and it lasts up to now.
Is it so
diﬃcult to ﬁnd a mistake in the transition from the quantum description to the
classical one and realize that the wave function describe the statistical ensemble,
but not a single particle? Does one need eighty years, to ﬁnd a simple mathematical
mistake?

We shall try to understand reasons of such a situation, because understanding
of these reasons may be useful for further development of the quantum mechanics.
We are interested in logical (but not in historical) reason of this mistake.

The connection between the dynamic systems (6) and (3) follows directly from
the conventional consideration of transition from the quantum description to the
classical one. It may be found in any textbook on quantum mechanics. It is amazing,
that nobody concluded from this consideration that the wave function describes the
statistical ensemble. As an example, we consider presentation of this problem in the
book by L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz [3]. There one uses the representation of
the wave function in the form

ψ = a exp(iS/h)

(7)

which is close to the result, which is obtained from the transformation (4). The
expression (7) is substituted in the Schr¨odinger equation

One pays attention that the ﬁrst equation (9) is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation,
whereas the second equation (9) describes displacement of the probability density
a2 according to the laws of the classical mechanics with the classical velocity ∇S/m
at any point. However, one does not make the evident conclusion that the equations
(9) are dynamic equations for some continuous dynamic system. One pays attention
only to the fact that equations (9) are equations of classical mechanics, but it remains
unclear, how many degrees of freedom (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) the classical dynamic system
has, although the result is quite clear from (9). It is supposed tacitly that the ﬁrst
equation (9) describes a single particle, having ﬁnite number of the freedom degrees.
But why? Is this a result of earlier papers, where the limit transition ~ → 0 was
realized directly in the equation (8)? Result of such a limit is the ﬁrst equation (9),
whereas the second equation disappears, because of the vanishing factor i~. If so, it
was a mistake.

To show that dynamic equations (9) are a partial case of dynamic equations
generated by the action (3), we introduce the density ρ and the velocity v by means
of designations

ρ = a2,

v =

∇S

m

Taking gradient of the ﬁrst equation (9), we obtain four hydrodynamic equations
instead of two dynamic equations (9)

∂0v + (v∇) v = 0,

∂0ρ + ∇ (ρv) = 0

Equations (11) is the Eulerian form of hydrodynamic equations for a ﬂuid without
a pressure. Variation of the action (3) with respect to x gives the Lagrangian form
of hydrodynamic equations for the same ﬂuid without a pressure

Thus, the dynamic system (6) is a partial (irrotational) case of the action (3).
It means that the wave function Ψb describes the statistical ensemble of free clas-
sical particles and, hence, the wave function ψ describes statistical ensemble of free
quantum particles, but not a single quantum particle.

The statement that the wave function describes always a statistical ensemble
E [Sst] has very important corollaries: All predictions of quantum mechanics are
statistical. They may be tested only by a massive measurement (M-measurement),
consisting of many single measurements (S-measurements). S-measurement and M-
measurement have diﬀerent properties. The S-measurement of the quantity R leads
to a deﬁnite value R′ of the quantity R (see details in [4]). The S-measurement is

4

irreproducible, in general, in other S-measurements in the same state ψ, whereas
the M-measurement of the quantity R leads to a distribution d (R′) of values R′ of
the quantity R, which is reproducible at other M-measurements at the same state
ψ. Besides, any S-measurement does not inﬂuence on the state ψ of the statistical
ensemble E [Sst], whereas the M-measurement may lead to a change of the state ψ
(so-called reduction).

Let at the M-measurement of the quantity R, we obtain some value R′. It is
impossible at the M-measurement, because it gives a distribution d (R′), but not
some value R′ of the measured quantity R. To obtain a deﬁnite value R′ at the M-
measurement, we need to redeﬁne the M-measurement. We must to introduce the se-
lective massive measurement (SM-measurement). It is the M-measurement accom-
panied by the selection of those S-measurements, constituting the M-measurement,
which give at the measurement the value R′ of the measured quantity R. Collecting
all these S-measurements, giving the value R′, we may constitute a new statistical
ensemble, whose state is described by the wave function ψR′. Transformation of the
previous state ψ into the state ψR′ is the reduction of the wave function ψ. There
is nothing enigmatic or paradoxical in this reduction. The reduction is a result of
the statistical procedure (selection). Reduction becomes enigmatic or paradoxical, if
we use one name (measurement) for three diﬀerent measurements (S-measurement,
M-measurement, SM-measurement). A use of one term for all diﬀerent measure-
ment and a confusion of them become unavoidable, if we suppose that the wave
function describes the state of an individual particle. Note that all paradoxes are
connected only with consideration of quantum measurements. They are absent at
consideration of the quantum mechanics formalism, because the quantum formalism
deals only with the wave function, and in this context it is of no importance, what
does the wave function describe (a single particle, or a statistical ensemble).

From the beginning of the quantum mechanics construction, it was known that
the Schr¨odinger equation may be considered as describing an irrotational ﬂow of
some ﬂuid [5], which has inﬁnite degrees of freedom. In the hydrodynamic represen-
tation it was easy to go to the limit ~ → 0 and to obtain that in the classical limit
the wave function describes a dynamic system with inﬁnite number of the freedom
degrees. Such a dynamic system cannot be a classical particle, which has only six
degrees of freedom. It means that the wave function cannot describe an individual
particle.

Interest to interpretation of quantum mechanics was very large from the very
beginning of the quantum mechanics creation up to now. Some scientiﬁc journals
(Physics Today (1999), Uspechi Fizicheskich Nauk (2002)) organized discussions de-
voted to problems of quantum measurements. There are scientists [6, 7, 8], which
believe that the wave function describes a statistical ensemble. There are scien-
tists [9, 10, 11, 12], which believe that the wave function describes a single particle.
There are scientists [13, 14, 15], whose position is intermediate. There is a lot of
papers devoted to interpretation of quantum mechanics. Now discussion of diﬀer-
ent viewpoints is only of historical interest, because all discussions were produced
on the verbal level. None of researchers had not set the problem mathematically:

5

Which of interpretation does follow from the quantum mechanics formalism? or in
negative form: Which of interpretation is incompatible with the quantum mechanics
formalism? Such a statement of the problem seems to be very reasonable. However,
the question in such a form was not set. After mathematical solution of this prob-
lem any discussion on the verbal level seems to be useless. One may analyze and
discuss initial statements of a mathematical theorem, but a verbal commentary to
a proof of a mathematical theorem has no convincing force, it may be used only for
clariﬁcation.

Beginning from the Heisenberg papers most scientists consider that the wave
function describes an individual particle, and none of them sets the question on
compatibility of such an interpretation with the quantum formalism. None of their
opponents sets this question also, although such a statement of the problem is very
reasonable.

We believe that such a situation is corollary of the general strategy of the quan-
tum mechanics construction. The quantum mechanics was constructed by means of
the trial and error method. This method is eﬀective for description and explanation
of concrete physical phenomena, but it is not adequate for construction of a funda-
mental theory, which tries to describe and to explain all physical phenomena from
the united viewpoint. Using the trial and error method, one suggests some hypothe-
ses, whose trueness is tested by an experiment. As a result of application of the trial
and error method the quantum mechanics is a list of prescriptions (quantum prin-
ciples), which stated what is the wave function and how this wave function should
be used for description of physical phenomena. Agreement between the diﬀerent
prescriptions is not so important, as a possibility of the experimental data explana-
tion. The conception, constructed by the trial and error method is not sensitive the
trueness and logical agreement between diﬀerent statements (prescriptions) of the
conception. Some statements may be incorrect, or one statement my be incompati-
ble with another. Nevertheless, the conception as a whole may explain some circle
of experimental data. Incompatibility between some prescriptions may hinder from
the expansion of the conception onto a wider circle of physical phenomena. It is
the main defect of the compensating theory, i.e. a theory constructed by the trial
and error method. In the framework of a compensating theory some mistakes in the
foundation of the theory are not discovered and corrected. They are simply ignored,
and their inﬂuence is compensated by newly invented hypotheses.

Quantum principles are the list of prescription, which admits one to describe and
explain nonrelativistic quantum phenomena. Quantum principles are nonrelativistic,
and this fact is an obstacle for construction of the relativistic quantum theory.
Why do we fail to discover the evident fact, that the wave function describes the
statistical ensemble of particles, but not an individual particle? Because the trial
and error method does not provide for a test of compatibility of diﬀerent points of
the prescription list. All the more so, the given point concerns only interpretation
but not the formalism of the quantum mechanics. Systematic use of the trial and
error method as a main tool of theoretical research in quantum theory had led to
appearance of a speciﬁc ”ﬁtting mentality”.

Unfortunately, an inﬂuence of the ﬁtting mentality appears not only in the inter-
pretation of quantum mechanics. Let us consider another example of this mentality.
The Pauli particle SP is the dynamic system, described by the dynamic equation

where ψP is the two-component complex wave function, Aµ is the electromagnetic
potential and σα are 2 × 2 Pauli matrices.

The Dirac particle SD is the dynamic system, described by the Dirac equation

ψD + mcψD = 0

(cid:17)
where ψD is the four-component complex function, the quantities γi, i = 0, 1, 2, 3
are 4 × 4 complex constant matrices, satisfying the relation

γlγk + γkγl = 2gklI,

k, l = 0, 1, 2, 3.

Here I is the 4 × 4 identity matrix, and gkl =diag(c−2, −1, −1, −1) is the metric
tensor. The quantity Ak, k = 0, 1, 2, 3 is the electromagnetic potential.

Conventionally the Pauli particle is considered to be a nonrelativistic approxi-
mation of the Dirac particle [16]. However, the Pauli equation (13) contains two
complex ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations for description of evolution of the two-
component complex wave function ψP, whereas the Dirac equation (14) contains
four complex ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations for description of evolution of the
four-component complex wave function ψD. How is it possible, that nonrelativis-
tic approximation of the four-component wave function is a two-component wave
function? Are another two components small? They are not small, in general. The
additional two components have very high temporal frequencies. The energy of
these high frequency components is radiated in the form of electromagnetic waves
very rapidly. These components becomes small and unessential from experimental
viewpoint, because they are unobservable at low frequencies.

Such a result is obtained, because one omits the temporal derivatives with small
parameter c−2 before them and reduces the order of the system of diﬀerential equa-
tions. From mathematical viewpoint such a procedure is incorrect, because it leads
to a loss of high frequency solutions (see details in [17]). Why this mathematical
mistake was not discovered during eighty years of the quantum mechanics exis-
tence? Because of the ﬁtting mentality of researchers, which are interested only in
explanation of experimental data and ignore the logical consistency in the problems,
which do not concerns experimental data directly. This example of application of
the ﬁtting mentality concerns already not only the QM interpretation. It concerns
already the relativistic quantum eﬀects, which are not observed now, but which may
be observed in future.

Finally, we point out an application of the ﬁtting mentality, which concerns con-
ceptual problems of the relativistic quantum theory construction. From viewpoint

7

of the conventional quantum theory the nonrelativistic character of quantum prin-
ciples is the main problem of the relativistic quantum theory construction. Most
researchers, working in the quantum ﬁeld theory, believe that applying the conven-
tional second quantization procedure to the classical ﬁelds, written in the relativisti-
cally covariant form, one can overcome the problem of the nonrelativistic character
of quantum principles. Unfortunately, they are not right, because besides, one needs
to use relativistic concept of the object of quantization. Particles and antiparticles
are not an adequate object of quantization (P A-quantization). Relativistic object
of the second quantization is the world line (W L-quantization). Practically nobody
objects that the relativistic state of the particle is its world line, but in practice all
researchers use a particle and an antiparticle as objects of the second quantization.
It leads to an incompatibility of dynamic equations with the commutation relations
(see details in [18]). Unfortunately, nobody tests compatibility of dynamic equation
with the commutation relations, assuming that the commutation relations are some-
thing like initial conditions for solution of dynamic equations. The initial conditions
may be given arbitrarily, and there is no necessity to test a their compatibility with
the dynamic equations. However, there are no complete analogy between the ini-
tial condition and the commutation relations, one needs to test the compatibility of
dynamic equations with the computation relations.

Such an approach, founded on the P A-scheme of the second quantization, is very
complicated. It generates a use of the perturbation theory, the vacuum nonstation-
arity and other problems. But on the other hand, because of inconsistency such an
approach admits one to obtain the particle production in such a situation, where
the particle production is really absent. Practically the particle production appears
at any nonlinear interaction, although the classical investigation shows, that the
particle production is possible only for a very special form of interaction [19].

The W L-scheme of quantization, where dynamic equations are compatible with
the commutation relations was applied [18] for the second quantization of the non-
linear complex scalar ﬁeld ϕ, described by the dynamic equation

~2∂k∂kϕ + m2c2ϕ = λϕ+ϕϕ

(16)

where λ is the self-action constant and ϕ+ is the Hermitian conjugate to ϕ. Ap-
plication of the consistent W L-scheme of quantization admits one to eliminate the
perturbational methods and use the exact methods of calculation, which contain,
in particular, the stationary vacuum. One shows that the nonlinear interaction of
the form λϕ+ϕϕ cannot produce particles. Besides, the simultaneous commutation
relations appear to depend on the constant λ, which shows that the commutation re-
lation may not be given arbitrarily. The corresponding paper [18] was not published,
because the reviewer of the paper said: ”The paper cannot be published, because
the method, suggested by the author, does not permit to obtain the particle produc-
tion”. The ﬁtting mentality has worked in the regular time, choosing inconsistent
approach, which gives desirable results and removing the consistent approach which
gives undesirable ones.

It is true, that the relativistic quantum theory, which cannot obtain the particle

8

production, is not a satisfactory theory. However, it is true also that the inconsistent
relativistic quantum theory, which explain the particle production, is not also a
satisfactory theory, because it cannot predict new physical phenomena. It can only
to explain them, using additional hypotheses. The author of the paper [18] knew in
advance that a consistent use of quantum principles in the second quantization of
the equation (16) cannot lead to a success. He hoped that the consistent method
and negative result of its application to (16) may lead to hesitations in the validity
of quantum principles and to a search of alternative approach (According to the
logical Newtonian method, if one uses the consistent investigation methods and
obtains incorrect result, one should look for a mistake in the foundation of the
theory). But the author made an error, he did not take into account the ﬁtting
mentality of the microworld researchers.

Note, that in classical physics of 19th century the ﬁtting mentality and a ﬁtting
in theoretical researches was absent. It was considered as something undigniﬁed in
the investigation of a good researcher. However, the Newtonian logical method of
investigation, which was used in 19th century is very sensitive to mistakes in the
foundations of the theory. It cannot work eﬀectively, if there is a mistake in the
fundamental statements of a theory. On the contrary, the trail and error methods
is insensitive to mistakes in the theory foundation. It uses additional hypotheses,
and can work without any foundation, creating new foundation in the process of
working.

The reasonable idea of describing quantum eﬀects as a result of a statistical
description of stochastically moving particle could not be realized mathematically,
because of a simple mistake in the understanding of the statistical description. One
believed that the statistical description and the probabilistic description is the same,
and any statistical description is carried out in terms of the probability and probabil-
ity density. In reality, the statistical description is a description of many independent
identical objects, whereas the probabilistic description is a description, which uses
the probability theory. Statistical description of pointlike objects may be produced
in terms of the probability theory, whereas the statistical description of lengthy
objects (for instance, world lines) in terms of probability is impossible. Statistical
ensemble of stochastic world lines is described simply as a dynamic system, without
a reference to the probability or to the probability density. This approach generates
the dynamic conception of the statistical description (DCSD).

In particular, the statistical ensemble of nonrelativistic classical particles can be
described either in the form (6) or in the form (3). In the same way, the action (1)
for the Schr¨odinger particle can be written in the form of the statistical ensemble
E [Sst] of stochastic particles Sst. We have [20]

where u = u (t, x) is a vector function of arguments t, x (not of t, ξ), and x = x (t, ξ)
is a vector function of independent variables t, ξ. The 3-vector u describes the

mean value of the stochastic component of the particle velocity, which is a function
of the variables t, x. The ﬁrst term m
describes the energy of the regular

component of the particle motion. The second term mu2/2 describes the energy of
(cid:0)
the random component of velocity. The components dx
dt and u of the total velocity
are connected with diﬀerent degrees of freedom, and their energies should be added
in the expression for the Lagrangian density. The last term −~∇u/2 describes
interaction between the regular component dx

dimensional vicinity of the point x, but not in the one-dimensional vicinity of the
point x on the one-dimensional curve. Variation of (17) with respect to dependent
variables x and u generates dynamic equations which contain the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion as a partial case. Statistical description in the form of the action (17) does not
contain any reference to a probability density.

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

Statistical description of stochastic world lines in terms of probability was im-
possible, the dynamic conception of statistical description was unknown. As a result
the trial and error method of investigation appeared to be the only possible method
of the quantum phenomena investigation. Application of this method admits one
to construct the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics on the basis of quantum princi-
ples, which are perceived simply as a list of prescriptions for working with such an
enigmatic object as the wave function. Three generations of scientists used the trial
and error method as the only possible method of research. The old logical Newto-
nian method was forgotten. It did not work under such condition, when there are
mistakes in the primary principles of the fundamental theory. The ﬁtting mentality
is a result of the long application of the trial and error method. Application of the
trial and error method for construction of the relativistic quantum theory is very
diﬃcult, because the relativistic quantum theory is constructed on the basis of non-
relativistic quantum principles, which prevent the created theory from introducing
relativistic concepts in it.

Now when one has succeeded to correct some mistakes in the foundation of the
microcosm phenomena theory and to construct DCSD, one needs only to apply
correctly the fundamental principles to the relativistic phenomena. At this stage of
investigation the ﬁtting mentality is the main obstacle on the way of the fundamental
theory development. The fact is that, the criteria of a true theory are diﬀerent in
the compensating theory (created by means of the trial and error method) and in
the fundamental theory (created on the basis of primary principles). For instance,
at the presentation of new theory the typical question looks as follows. What new

10

phenomena does your theory explain? This question is crucial at the presentation of
a new compensating theory, because the new compensating theory suggested some
new hypotheses. The suggested question tests, to what extent the new hypotheses
are satisfactory. At the same time this question is useless at the presentation of the
fundamental theory, because there are no new hypotheses in the fundamental theory.
The fundamental principles are not tested by a single experiments. They are veriﬁed
by the totality of all experimental data. If the fundamental principles are true, any
test of predictions of the theory in a single experiment veriﬁes only correctness of
application of fundamental principles in the given case, but not the trueness of
the fundamental principles themselves. Correctness of application is determined
by the qualiﬁcation of the researcher, but not by the trueness of the fundamental
principles. It is a reason, why predictions of the true fundamental theory for new
physical phenomena appear to be more exact, than those of the compensating theory.
In many cases the compensating theory cannot make prediction at all. It can only
explain, using new hypotheses.

Finally, we shall point out, how one should construct relativistic quantum theory,
using fundamental principles. These fundamental principles are the conventional
classical principles. For instance, we want to quantize the free relativistic particle of
the mass m. The quantization operation is a usual dynamic procedure. We construct
statistical ensemble of classical relativistic particles described by the action

A [x] = −

mc

gik ˙xi ˙xkd4ξ,

d4ξ = dξ0dξ,

(19)

Z

p

where x = {xi (ξ0, ξ)} ,
i = 0, 1, 2, 3 are dependent variables.
{ξk} , k = 0, 1, 2, 3 are independent variables, and ˙xi ≡ dxi/dξ0.

To quantize the relativistic particle, we should make the change
~

m → mK,

K =

1 + λ2 (κlκl + ∂lκl),

ξ = {ξ0, ξ} =

λ =

mc

(20)

q
where the quantities κl =
, l = 0, 1, 2, 3 are additional dependent variables,
describing stochastic component of the particle motion. Then the action for the
(cid:9)
statistical ensemble of stochastic (quantum) particles takes the form

which does not contain neither wave function, nor operators. The action (21) does
not contain any reference to the quantum principles, and interpretation of descrip-
tion is realized in terms of the particle position xk. Nevertheless, using a proper
change of variables one can introduce the wave function [19] and show, that in
terms of the wave function the dynamic equation, generated by the action (21), is

turns into the action (17)

To explain the pair production eﬀect, it is necessary to apply DCSD to the
relativistic dynamic systems, consisting of several particles. There is no necessity to
invent new hypotheses for this purpose.

Abstract. Gravitational anomalies such as the mine/borehole g

anomaly, the near-ﬂatness of the spiral galaxy rotation-velocity curves,

currently interpreted as a ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, the absence of that ef-

fect in ordinary elliptical galaxies, and the ongoing problems in accu-

rately determining Newton’s gravitational constant GN are explained by

a generalisation of the Newtonian theory of gravity to a ﬂuid-ﬂow for-

malism with one new dimensionless constant. By analysing the borehole

and spiral galaxy data this constant is shown to be the ﬁne structure
constant α = e2/¯hc

1/137. This formalism then also explains the

≈

cause of the long-standing uncertainties in GN and leads to the intro-

duction of a fundamental gravitational constant G

= GN with value
10−11 m2s−2kg−1. The occurrence of α implies

G = (6.6526

that space has a quantum structure, and we have the ﬁrst evidence of

Introduction. There are numerous gravitational phenomena which are inexplicable

within the Newtonian theory of gravity, including the mine/borehole g anomaly [1, 2, 3],

the almost ﬂat rotation-velocity curves of spiral galaxies [4], the absence of that eﬀect in

ordinary elliptical galaxies [5], and an ongoing lack of convergence in measurements of

the Newtonian Gravitational constant GN over the last 60 years [6], and other anoma-

lies not discussed here. The spiral galaxy eﬀect has been interpreted as being caused by

an unknown form of ‘dark matter’ [7]. Historically the Newtonian theory was based on

observations within the solar system, in which small test ‘objects’, planets, are in orbit

about a large central mass - the sun. A unique extension of the Newtonian theory, made

possible by recognising that this theory has a natural ‘ﬂuid-ﬂow’ formulation, and which

introduces one new dimensionless gravitational constant, shows that when the mass dis-

tribution is not spherical, or even within a spherical mass distribution, then and only

then does the extended theory show deviations from Newtonian gravity, and indeed ac-

counts for the various gravitational anomalies. Basically the solar system had too high

a spherical system to have revealed a fundamental feature of gravity. By analysing the

borehole and spiral galaxy data this constant is shown to be the ﬁne structure constant
α = e2/¯hc = 1/137.036.

Gravity and the ‘Dark Matter’ Eﬀect. The extended theory [8, 9, 10] has the ﬂuid-

ﬂow form, assuming no vorticity

where ρ(r, t) is the matter density, α is a new dimensionless constant, G is the Newtonian

gravitational constant, and D is the symmetric part of the ﬂuid mechanics rate-of-strain

For speciﬁcity consider the velocity ﬂow ﬁeld v(r, t) as deﬁned with respect to the Cosmic

Microwave Background frame of reference. The ﬂow is interpreted as an ongoing repro-

cessing of a substratum structure of space; not as a ﬂow through space. Together with (1)

deﬁnes an eﬀective ‘dark matter’ (DM) density, but which is associated solely with the

self-interaction of the ﬂuid-ﬂow system. When α = 0 (4) reduces to the Newtonian theory

In terms of the early work by Kepler and Newton the key insight is that for this velocity

ﬁeld ρDM = 0, and for this reason in the solar system, with M the mass of the sun, the

need for both a ﬂuid-ﬂow formalism and this ‘dark matter’ term went unnoticed for over

300 years.

The discovery announced here is that (1) together with (3) explain the gravitational

anomalies noted above, and that remarkably the data indicate that the value of α is
identical to the value of the ﬁne structure constant, α = e2/¯hc

1/137 (hence the

≈

notation) which means that this is the discovery of a quantum-foam substratum of space:

a quantum gravity eﬀect. Despite the demonstration herein that the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect

is not a form of matter, the structure in (4) implies that the terminology is nevertheless

useful, keeping in mind that ρDM can be negative.

and we see that the eﬀective Newtonian gravitational constant in (13) is GN = (1 + α

2 )G

which is diﬀerent to the fundamental gravitational constant G in (1). The result in (13),

which is diﬀerent from that of the Newtonian theory (α = 0) has actually been observed

in mine/borehole measurements [1, 2, 3] of g(r), though of course there had been no

explanation for the eﬀect, and indeed the reality of the eﬀect was eventually doubted.

The gravity residual [1, 2, 3] is deﬁned as

which is the form actually observed [1, 2, 3]. So outside of the spherical earth the New-

tonian theory and the in-ﬂow theory are indistinguishable, as indicated by the horizontal

line, for r > R, in Fig.1. However inside the earth the two theories give a diﬀerent

dependence on r, due to the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect within the earth.

Gravity residuals from a borehole into the Greenland Ice Cap were determined down
to a depth of 1.5km [3]. The ice had a density of ρ(R) = 930 kg/m3, and from (17), using
10−11 m2s−2kg−1, we obtain from a linear ﬁt to the slope of the data

GN = 6.6742

points in Fig.1 that α−1 = 139
5, which equals the value of the ﬁne structure constant
α−1 = 137.036 to within the errors, and for this reason we identify the α constant in (1) as

±

being the ﬁne structure constant. To conﬁrm that this is not a coincidence we now extract

another determination of the value of α from data from a totally diﬀerent phenomenon.

Spiral Galaxies. Consider the solution of (1) for a galaxy with a non-spherical matter

distribution. Then numerical techniques are necessary, but beyond a suﬃciently large

distance the in-ﬂow will have spherical symmetry, and in that region we may use (8) and

(9) with ρ(r) = 0. Remarkably then the in-ﬂow equation has an exact non-perturbative

analytic solution,

spiral galaxy RS is ﬁnite: basically such a matter system triggers a highly non-perturbative

. However for a highly non-spherical matter system, such as a

in-ﬂow, and the self-interaction of the ‘quantum-foam’ substratum is manifestly diﬀerent

from the Newtonian prediction. The galactic circular orbital velocities of stars etc may

be used to observe this process in a spiral galaxy and from (3) and (18) we obtain a

replacement for the Newtonian ‘inverse square law’ (6),

and hence (6) is only vaild outside a spherically symmetric matter distribution, for then

Because of the α dependent part this rotation-velocity curve falls oﬀ extremely slowly

with r, as is indeed observed for spiral galaxies. Of course it was the inability of the

Newtonian gravity theory to explain these observations that led to the notion of ‘dark

matter’. In a remarkable development it is possible to ﬁnd the value of the constant α

from the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. Persic, Salucci and Stel [4] analysed some 1100

optical and radio rotation curves, and discovered empirically that they were described to

within 4% by a universal rotation curve, where asymptotically

Here Ropt is the optical radius, or matter limit. By doing a least squares ﬁt of (20) to (21)

on the interval 1.0 < x < 1.05, which is the region just outside where the matter density has

fallen almost to zero exponentially, but where there are still suﬃcient objects to observe the
rotation velocity, we obtain α−1 = 137.1

in Fig.2, which gives again the value of the ﬁne structure constant to within even smaller

errors. Hence the very diﬀerent borehole and spiral galaxy data conﬁrm the validity of

the gravity theory in (1) and (3). RS in (18) is related to the matter size by a relationship
R/e2, where e is the eccentricity of the matter distribution and R is a scale size
like RS ∼

7

for that distribution, and so for an elliptical galaxy e

0 and RS >> Ropt, and so there is

≈

essentially no external ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, that is, the rotation curves decrease like 1/√r.

This explains the recent discovery [5] that planetary nebulae in ordinary elliptical galaxies

do have such Keplerian or Newtonian rotation curves.

At the center of matter distributions the new theory of gravity also displays a novel

phenomenon, namely the occurrence of ‘in-ﬂow singularities’ which act as black holes.

Such black holes are mandated by the in-ﬂow and are not contingent phenomena: at the

center of elliptical galaxies, spiral galaxies and globular clusters ρ(r) = 0 so again (18) is

the relevant exact solution, in the case of spherical symmetry in the core region. Recently

globular clusters have been discovered [12] to have central black holes, as is predicted by

(1). Again the spatial structure of these black hole in-ﬂow singularities is determined by α

- they are intrinsically quantum processes, and their eﬀective ‘mass’ is computable within

the new theory. Such novel ‘black hole eﬀects’ may also be occurring in other systems.

Eqn.(1) also has novel gravitational wave phenomena [8, 9, 10].

Measuring G. Finally it is now possible to explain the cause of the longstanding varia-

tions [6] in the measurements of the value of GN , shown in Fig.3. Note that the relative
spread ∆GN /GN ≈
laboratory experiments used diﬀerent matter geometries, and as we have seen, the ge-

α, as we would now expect. Essentially the diﬀerent Cavendish-type

ometry of the masses has a major eﬀect on the in-ﬂow, and so on the measured force

between the masses. Only for the borehole-type experiments do we have a complete ana-
10−11
lytic analysis, and an ocean measurement [11] of g gives a GN = (6.677
m2s−2kg−1, shown by the upper horizontal line in Fig.3. From that value we may extract

Conclusion. The new theory of gravity is able to explain the numerous gravitational

anomalies, only a few of which have been discussed here. In doing so comparisons with

the observations show that the theory describes gravity as an inhomogeneous in-ﬂow into

matter, and essentially reveals space to be a quantum-foam process, with the strength of

the self-interactions in this process set by the ﬁne structure constant, while G speciﬁes the

interaction strength between space and matter. Hence quantum gravity eﬀects are much

larger than expected and observable.

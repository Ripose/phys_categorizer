Imprints of Discrete Space Time - A Brief Note

Abstract

We point out that the observed decay mode of the pion and the

Kaon decay puzzle are really imprints of discrete micro space-time.

In recent years ideas of discrete space time have been revived through the
work of several scholars and by the author within the context of Kerr-
Newman Black Hole type formulation of the electron[1]-[5]. Further, even
more recently this has been considered in the context of a stochastic underpinning[6,
7]. Let us now consider two of the imprints that such discrete space time
would have.
First we consider the case of the neutral pion. Within the framework of the
Kerr-Newman metric type formulation referred to above, it is possible to
recover the usual picture of a pion as a quark-anti quark bound state [8, 9],
though equally well we could think of it as an electron-positron bound state
also[4, 10]. In this case we have,

r

=

e2
r2

(1)

Consistently with the above formulation, if we take v = c from (1) we get
the correct Compton wavelength lπ = r of the pion.
However this appears to go against the fact that there would be pair annihi-
lation with the release of two photons. However if we consider discrete space
time, the situation would be diﬀerent. In this case the Schrodinger equation

Hψ = Eψ

(2)

where H contains the above Coulumb interaction could be written, in terms
of the space and time separated wave function components as (Cf. also
ref.[2]),

Hψ = EφT = φı¯h[

T (t − τ ) − T

τ

]

(3)

where τ is the minimum time cut oﬀ which in the above work has been taken
to be the Compton time (Cf.refs.[4] and [5]). If, as usual we let T = exp(irt)
we get

(4) shows that if,

E = −

τ

|E| <

(5)

holds then there are stable bound states. Indeed inequality (5) holds good
when τ is the Compton time and E is the total energy mc2. Even if inequality
(5) is reversed, there are decaying states which are relatively stable around
the cut oﬀ energy 2¯h
τ .
This is the explanation for treating the pion as a bound state of an electron
and a positron, as indeed is borne out by its decay mode. The situation is
similar to the case of Bohr orbits– there also the electrons would according
to classical ideas have collapsed into the nucleus and the atoms would have
disappeared. In this case it is the discrete nature of space time which enables
the pion to be a bound state as described by (1).
Another imprint of discrete space time can be found in the Kaon decay
puzzle, as pointed out by the author[11]. There also we have equations like
(2) and (3) above, with the energy term being given by E(1 + i), due to the
fact that space time is quantized. Not only is the fact that the imaginary and
real parts of the energy are of the same order is borne out but as pointed out
in[11] this also explains the recently observed[12] decay and violation of the
time reversal symmetry which in the words of Penrose[13], ”the tiny fact of
an almost completely hidden time-asymmetry seems genuinely to be present
in the K 0-decay. It is hard to believe that nature is not, so to speak, trying to
tell something through the results of this delicate and beautiful experiment.”
From an intuitive point of view, the above should not be surprising because
time reversal symmetry is based on a space time continuum and is no longer
obvious if space time were discrete.

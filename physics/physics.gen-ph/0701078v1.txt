Abstract

We present simple classical dynamical models to illustrate the idea
of introducing a stochasticity with non-locality into the time variable.
For stochasticity in time, these models include noise in the time vari-
able but not in the “space” variable, which is opposite to the normal
description of stochastic dynamics. Similarly with respect to non-
locality, we discuss delayed and predictive dynamics which involve
two points separated on the time axis. With certain combinations of
ﬂuctuations and non-locality in time, we observe a “resonance” eﬀect.
This is an eﬀect similar to stochastic resonance, which has been dis-
cussed within the normal context of stochastic dynamics, but with
diﬀerent mechanisms. We discuss how these models may be devel-
oped to ﬁt a broader context of generalized dynamical systems where
ﬂuctuations and non-locality are present in both space and time.

1 Introduction

“Time” is a concept that has drawn a lot of attention from thinkers in virtu-
ally all disciplines [1]. In particular, our ordinary perception is that space and
time are not the same, and this diﬀerence appears in various contemplations
of nature. It appears to be the main reason for the theory of relativity, which
has conceptually brought space and time closer to receiving equal treatment,
and it continues to fascinate and attract thinkers from diverse ﬁelds. More-
over, issues such as the “direction” or the “arrow” of time [2] and complex
time [3] are current research interests.

It seems that there are other manifestations of this diﬀerence. One is the
treatment of noise or ﬂuctuations in dynamical systems. Time in dynamical
systems, whether they are classical, quantum, or relativistic, is commonly
viewed as not having stochastic characteristics. In stochastic dynamical the-
ories, we associate noise and ﬂuctuations with only “space” variables, such
as the position of a particle, and not with the time variable. In quantum
mechanics, the concept of time ﬂuctuation is embodied in the time-energy
uncertainty principle. However, time is not treated as a dynamical quantum
observable, and clear understanding of the time-energy uncertainty has yet
to be found [4].

Another diﬀerence seems to show up in our cognition of non-locality in
space and time. Non-local eﬀects in space are incorporated in physical the-
ories describing wave propagation, ﬁelds, and so on. In quantum mechanics,
the issue of spatial non-locality is more intricate, constituting the backbone
of such quantum eﬀects as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox [5]. With
respect to time, there have been investigations of memory eﬀects in dynami-
cal equations. However, less attention has been paid to non-locality in time,
and behaviors associated with non-locality in time, such as delay diﬀerential
equations, are not yet fully understood [6, 7, 8, 9].

Against this background, the main topic of this paper is to consider
stochasticity and non-locality of time in classical dynamics through a pre-
sentation of simple models. We discuss delayed and predictive dynamics as
examples of non-locality in time. For stochastitiy, we present a delayed dy-
namical model with ﬂuctuating time, or stochastic time. We shall see that
this combination of stochasticity and non-locality in time can exhibit be-
haviors which are similar to stochastic resonance [10, 11, 12], which arises
through a combination of oscillating behavior and “spatial” noise and has
been studied in variety of ﬁelds [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

2 Delayed and Predictive Dynamics

We start with a consideration of non-locality of time in classical dynamical
models. The general diﬀerential equation of the class of dynamics we discuss
here is as follows.

dx(t)
dt

= f (¯x(¯t), x(t)).

Here, x is a dynamical variable of time t, and f is the “dynamical func-
tion” governing the dynamics.
Its diﬀerence from the normal dynamical
equation appears in ¯t, which can be either in the past or the future, and
= ¯t in general. In other words, the change in x(t) is governed by f , not
t
its “current” state x(t), but its state ¯x at ¯t. We can deﬁne ¯t and ¯x, as well
as the function f , in a variety of ways. In the following, we will present two
cases: delayed and predictive dynamics.

Delayed dynamics can be obtained from the general deﬁnition by

¯t = t

τ,

−

¯x(¯t) = x(t

τ ).

−

Here, τ > 0 is the delay, and the dynamics depend on two points on the
time axis separated by τ . Delayed dynamical equations have been studied
for various applications [6, 7, 8, 9].

Predictive dynamics, on the other hand, have recently been proposed
[18, 19] and, they take ¯t in the future, i.e., ¯t = t + η. We call η > 0 an
“advance”. We also need to deﬁne the state of the dynamical variable x at
this future point in time. Here, we estimate x such that

(1)

(2)

(3)

¯x(¯t = t + η) = η

+ x(t).

dx(t)
dt

This prediction is termed “ﬁxed rate prediction”. Namely, we estimate x as
the value that would be obtained if the current rate of change extends for
a duration from the present point to the future point. Qualitatively, this is
one of the most commonly used methods for estimating population, national
debt, and so on.

We also note that there are studies of equations called “functional diﬀer-
ential equations of the advanced type”, or “advanced functional diﬀerential
equations” [20, 21, 22]. They also are diﬀerential equations with advanced
arguments, and we can obtain equations of this class from our general deﬁ-
nition by setting,

¯x(¯t = t + η) = x(t + η),

(4)

with suitably chosen boundary conditions. The predictive dynamical equa-
tions diﬀer from this class of equations, as we allow ﬂexibility in deﬁning ¯x
based on a prediction scheme.

We shall investigate the properties of these delayed and predictive dy-
namical models through computer simulations. To avoid ambiguity and for
simplicity, we will study time-discretized map dynamical models, which incor-
porate the above–mentioned general properties of the delayed and predictive
dynamical equations.

Here, α is a parameter controlling the rate of change. For a delayed map
with a delay τ , we deﬁne

while for the predictive map with an advance η, we have

We choose the Mackey-Glass function as the dynamical function (Fig. 1),

i.e.,

where β and s are parameters. This function was ﬁrst proposed for modeling
the cell reproduction process and is known to induce chaotic behavior with
a large delay [6].

Figure 2 shows examples of computer simulations of the delayed and
predictive cases. The parameters are set so that without a delay or advance,
τ = η = 0, the model monotonically approaches the stable ﬁxed point. The
stability of the ﬁxed point is lost as τ , or η, increases, giving rise to complex
dynamics. Thus, non-locality in time can induce a complex behavior in
otherwise simple dynamical systems.

Now, we would like to make a few remarks. First, in the case of delayed
dynamics, we need to decide on the initial function and delay. Analogously, in
predictive dynamics, the prediction scheme and advance need to be speciﬁed.
Common to delayed and predictive dynamical systems, both factors aﬀect the
nature of the dynamics.

In addition, we can use linear stability analysis on both the delayed and
predictive cases. This analysis can give an estimate of the critical delay or
advance at which the stability of the ﬁxed point is lost. However, the nature
of the dynamics beyond these critical points is not yet clearly understood.

For the case of delayed dynamics, with the addition of a suitable “strength”
of noise, a behavior similar to stochastic resonance has been obtained [23].
This phenomenon, called “delayed stochastic resonance,” has a diﬀerent
mechanism in the sense that it does not require external oscillatory signals or
forces, but instead it uses a delay as the source of the oscillation to be com-
bined with noise. An analogous resonance phenomenon has been observed in
predictive dynamics with added noise, which is termed “predictive stochastic
resonance”[19].

3 Stochastic Time

We now turn our attention to the ﬂuctuation of time, which we term “stochas-
tic time” in the context of classical dynamical systems. As in non-locality,
there are various ways to bring in stochasticity. We have found that stochas-
tic time combined with delayed dynamics leads to phenomena similar to
stochastic resonance.

The general diﬀerential equation of the class of delayed dynamics with

stochastic time is given as

dx(¯t)
d¯t

= f (x(¯t), x(¯t

τ )).

−

(9)

Here, as in the previous section, x is the dynamical variable of time t,
and f is the “dynamical function” governing the dynamics. τ is the delay.

The diﬀerence from the normal delayed dynamical equation appears in ¯t,
which now contains stochastic characteristics, and these can be introduced
in various ways. We will again focus on the following dynamical map system
incorporating the basic ideas of the general deﬁnition given above.

xnk+1 = f (xnk, xnk−τ ),
nk+1 = nk + ξk

(10)

Here, ξk is the stochastic variable which can take either +1 or
1 with certain
probabilities. We associate “time” with an integral variable n. The dynamics
progress by incrementing integer k, and n occasionally “goes back” a unit
1 be p for
with the occurrence of ξ =
all k, and we set n0 = 0. Then, with p = 0, this map naturally reduces to
a normal delayed map with nk = k. We update the variable xn with the
larger k. Hence, xn in the “past” could be “re-written” as n decreases with
probability p.

1. Let the probability of ξk =

−

We can make an analogy of this model with a tele–typewriter or a tape–
recorder, which occasionally moves back on a tape. Figure 3 gives a schematic
view. Based on the values of xn and xn−τ , the recording device writes on
the tape the values of x at a step, and “time” is associated with positions on
the tape. When there is no ﬂuctuation (p = 0), the head moves only in one
direction on the tape and it records values of x for a normal delayed dynamics.
With probability 0 < p, it moves back a unit of “time” to overwrite the value
of x. The question is how the recorded patterns of x on the tape are aﬀected
as we change p.

Figure 3: Schematic view of the model.

We will keep the Mackey-Glass function as the dynamical function, and

the map model becomes

xnk+1 = (1
nk+1 = nk + ξk,

−

α)xnk + f (xnk−τ ),

(12)

where α, β, and s are parameters. With both α < β positive, and no
stochasticity in time, this map has a stable ﬁxed point with no delay. Linear
stability analysis around the ﬁxed point gives the critical delay τc, at which
the stability of the ﬁxed point is lost.

A larger delay gives an oscillatory dynamical path. We have found,
through computer simulations, that an interesting behavior arises when the
delay is smaller than this critical delay. The tuned noise in the time ﬂow gives
the system a tendency for oscillatory behavior. In other words, by adjusting
the value of p controlling ξ, one induces oscillatory dynamical paths. Some
22.5 with the set
examples are shown in Figure 4. (The critical delay is τc ∼
of parameters.) With increasing probability for a time ﬂow to reverse, i.e.,
with increasing p, we observe oscillatory behavior in the sample dynamical
path as well as in the corresponding power spectrum. However, as p increases
further, the oscillatory behavior begins to deteriorate. In order to see this,
we compute the “signal–to–noise” (S/N) ratio by using the ratio of the peak
height to the background in the spectrum. Figure 5 illustrates this change
in S/N, which reaches a maximum at an appropriately “tuned” value of p.
Again, we see a phenomenon which resembles stochastic resonance. A

theoretical analysis of the mechanism of our model is yet to be done.
particular, we note that the model has an intricate mixture of time scales
of delay, the oscillation period of xn, and stochastic time. These factors are
likely to be involved in the time scale analysis [24], but we leave consideration
of them for the future. On the other hand, this resonance with stochastic
time is clearly of a diﬀerent type and new. We discussed only the Mackey–
Glass function for consistency, but the same behavior is also observed in other
delayed dynamical systems, such as ones with a negative feedback function
[25].

We have also studied predictive dynamics with stochastic time, but so far,
have not found behaviors similar to this resonance with delayed dynamics.
Yet, the example above with delayed dynamics indicates that a combination
of stochasticity and non-locality in time may lead to entirely new phenomena.

4 Discussion

We could extend our model so that we have a picture of dynamical systems
with stochasticity and non-locality on the time and space axes. The analyt-
ical framework and tools for such descriptions need to be developed, along
with a search for appropriate applications.

An example of an appropriate application of temporal non-locality is mod-
eling a stick balancing on a human ﬁngertip. Recent experiments have found
that most of the observed corrective motions occur on shorter time scales
than that of the human reaction time [26, 27, 28]. This may be the result
of intricate mixtures of physiological delays, predictions, and physical ﬂuc-
tuations. Models incorporating special ﬂuctuations and delays have been
considered, but none have tried to include the eﬀect of prediction.

Another direction of development might be to extend the path integral
formalism to allow stochastic time paths. The question of whether this ex-
tension bridges to quantum mechanics and/or leads to an alternative under-
standing of such properties as the time-energy uncertainty relations requires
further investigation.

Finally, if these models can capture some aspects of reality, particularly
with respect to temporal stochasticity, this resonance may be used as an

10

experimental indication for probing ﬂuctuations or stochasticity in time. We
have previously proposed “delayed stochastic resonance”[23], a resonance
that occurs through the interplay of noise and a delay. It was theoretically
extended [29], and recently, it was experimentally observed in a solid-sate
laser system with a feedback loop [30]. We leave it for the future to see if an
analogous experimental test could be developed with respect to stochasticity
and non-locality of time.

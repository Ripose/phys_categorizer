This paper is a sequence of the work presented in [1], where, the principles of the general rela-
tivity have been used to formulate quantum wave equations taking into account the eﬀect of the
electromagnetic and strong interactions in the space-time metric of quantum systems. Now, the role
of the energy-momentum tensor in this theory is studied, and it is consistent with the formulation of
the general quantum mechanics shown in [1]. With this procedure, a dynamical cut-oﬀ is generated
and the constant A of the ﬁeld equation is calculated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A major question in the formulation of physics is if the concepts used to study large scale systems, as galaxies and
even in the cosmology, may be applied to very small systems, such as atoms and elementary particles. Should the
basic principles of physics depend on the size of the object?

In practical terms, one aspect of this question is if the microscopic world interactions, the weak, electromagnetic
and the strong, may aﬀect signiﬁcantly the space-time metric and if this proposition may have any observable eﬀect.
In this description, the gravitational forces may be neglected, and it is a good approximation, due to the small masses
of the considered particles. In [1], these ideas have been formulated considering a particle in a region with a potential,
that aﬀects the metric, and the wave equations for spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles, based on the general relativity
principles, have been proposed, generating very interesting results.

The simplest systems where this theory could be tested are the one electron atoms, and the calculation of the
deuterium spectrum has shown a clear numerical improvement when compared with the usual Dirac spectrum [2],
[3] (also proposed by Sommerfeld [4]), with a percentual deviation from the experimental results approximately ﬁve
times smaller, near one additional digit of precision.

An interesting fact that appeared from this theory, is the existence of black holes inside these quantum systems,
with sizes that are not negligible. This propriety, that is related with the existence of a trapping surface at r0, as it was
deﬁned by Penrose [6], in [5] have been successfully used in order to describe quark conﬁnement. Solving the quantum
wave equations [5], quark conﬁnement has been obtained, without the need of introducing conﬁning potentials, as it
is currently done [7]- [10]. The conﬁnement obtained in this way is a strong conﬁnement, as the quark wave functions
are not continuos at r0.

In order to compliment this theory, proposed in [1] and [5], the energy-momentum tensor must be included in this
formulation, and this study is the main purpose of this paper. We look for consistence with the previous results in
an approach based on the energy-momentum tensor T µν.

II. FIELD EQUATIONS AND METRIC

In this section, the ﬁeld equations for particles subjected to electromagnetic and strong interactions, neglecting the
eﬀect of the gravitational ﬁeld, will be obtained. For this purpose we will make a brief review of the results of [1],
and then, relate them with a formulation based on the energy-momentum tensor.

As a ﬁrst step, a system with spherical symmetry will be considered, but the basic ideas can be generalized to
If the spherical symmetry is considered, the space-time may be described by a

to the sum of its rest mass E0 with the potential, and then,

Applying these ideas in the study of one electron atoms, one must consider a Coulomb interaction

and ξ is given by

These expressions determine the horizon of events at r0, that appears from the metric singularity ξ(r0)=0, and using
the values of [13], one ﬁnds

that is not a negligible value at the atomic scale.

Now, let us turn our attention to a description based on the energy-momentum tensor.

determined by the energy-momentum tensor and the ﬁeld equations, with (7), determined by the energy relation (3).

Identifying the terms r−1 and r−2 we have

The ﬁeld equation is then

So, in this system, due to the interaction, the electron energy decrease with r, until it reaches the value E(r0) = 0

Considering that the strong interactions may be approximated by a strong coulomb ﬁeld [5], with α

may use the ﬁeld equation (21) in order to study strongly interacting systems. But if one wants to describe the
strong interactions by the Yang-Mills ﬁeld, (21) is determined by the correct coupling constant α, and an Yang-Mills
energy-momentum tensor.

III. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

4

In this paper the study of quantum systems in curved spaces has been continued. The metric is determined
by the interaction of quantum objects, such as electrons and quarks. The eﬀect of the energy-momentum tensor
of electromagnetic and strong interactions in the space-time has been considered, and with this procedure the the
constant of the ﬁeld equations has been calculated. The results obtained are consistent with the ones of [1].

One can observe the presence of the mass in the constant A, what does not happen in the general relativity, fact
g/m2, one concludes that the eﬀect of the curvature of
that is due to the equivalence principle. Observing that A
space-time decreases for large masses and increases for small masses and for large coupling constants. It is interesting
to note that a dynamical cut-oﬀ is determined by this theory, as it was used in eq. (16), providing correct results.

Another observation that must be made is that initially, spherical symmetry has been supposed, but eq. (21) is
general, independent of the symmetry of the system. This equation may also be used with the inclusion of other
interactions, as the Yang-Mills one, for example, considering the Yang-Mills ﬁeld tensor F a
µν in the construction of
the energy-momentum tensor, and quark conﬁnement, from the results of this theory, is expected to occur.

One must remark that with the development of the general quantum mechanics, we are being able to explain many
characteristics of the studied physical systems, using the new proprieties that appears from the understanding of the
geometry of the space-time.

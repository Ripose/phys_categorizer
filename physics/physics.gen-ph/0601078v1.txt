Monogenic functions in 5-dimensional spacetime used as ﬁrst principle: gravitational
dynamics, electromagnetism and quantum mechanics

Jos´e B. Almeida∗
Universidade do Minho, Physics Department, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal†

Monogenic functions are functions of null vector derivative and are here analysed in the geometric
algebra of 5-dimensional spacetime, G4,1, in order to derive several laws of fundamental physics. The
paper introduces the working algebra and the deﬁnition of monogenic functions, showing that these
generate two 4-dimensional spaces, one with Euclidean signature and the other one with Minkowski
signature. The equivalence conditions between the two spaces are studied and relativistic dynamics,
not entirely coincident with Einstein’s general theory of relativity, is demonstrated. The monogenic
condition is then shown to produce Maxwell’s equations and electrodynamics both classical and
quantized.

INTRODUCTION

D’Inverno [3, section 14.7]):

Our goal is to show how the important equations of
physics, such as relativity equations and equations of
quantum mechanics, can be put under the umbrella of
a common mathematical approach[1, 2]. We use geomet-
ric algebra as the framework but introduce monogenic
functions with their null derivatives in order to advance
the concept. Furthermore, we clarify some previous work
in this direction and identify the steps to take in order
to complete this ambitious project.

Since A. Einstein formulated dynamics

in 4-
dimensional spacetime, this space is recognized by the
vast majority of physicists as being the best for formu-
lating the laws of physics. However, mathematical con-
siderations lead to several alternative 4-D spaces. For ex-
ample, the 4-dimensional space called 4-D optics (4DO)
is equivalent to the 4-D spacetime of the general theory
of relativity (GTR) when the metric is static, and there-
fore the geodesics of one space can be mapped one-to-one
with those of the other. Then one can choose to work in
the space that is more suitable.

In the case of a central mass, we can examine how the
Schwarzschild metric in GTR can be transposed to 4DO.

We devote the ﬁrst part of this paper to deriving
them from a geometric algebra approach in a special
5D space with null geodesics, thereby establishing that
there is a 4DO Euclidean metric space equivalent to
the Schwarzschild metric space. We build upon previ-
ous work by ourselves and by other authors about null
geodesics, regarding the condition that all material par-
ticles must follow null geodesics of 5D space:

The implication of this for particles is
clear: they should travel on null 5D geodesics.
This idea has recently been taken up in the
literature, and has a considerable future. It
means that what we perceive as massive par-
ticles in 4D are akin to photons in 5D.[4]

Accordingly, particles moving on null
paths in 5D (dS2 = 0) will appear as mas-
sive particles moving on timelike paths in 4D
(ds2 > 0) . . . [5]

We actually improve on these null displacement ideas
by introducing the more fundamental monogenic condi-
tion, deriving the former from the latter and establishing
a common ﬁrst principle.

II. SOME GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

Geometric algebra is not usually taught in university
courses and its presence in the literature is scarce; good
reference works are [6, 7, 8]. We will concentrate on
the algebra of 5-dimensional spacetime because this will
be our main working space; this algebra incorporates as
subalgebras those of the usual 3-dimensional Euclidean
space, Euclidean 4-space and Minkowski spacetime. We
begin with the simpler 5D ﬂat space and progress to a
5D spacetime of general curvature (see Appendix C for
more details.)

The geometric algebra G4,1 of the hyperbolic 5-
dimensional space we consider is generated by the co-
ordinate frame of orthonormal basis vectors σα such that

follow the conventions set forth in Appendix A. We will
also assume this spacetime to be a metric space whose
metric tensor is given by

gβ;

gαβ = gα·
the double index is used with g to denote the inner prod-
uct of frame vectors and not their geometric product.
The space signature is (
+ + + +), which amounts to
saying that g00 < 0 and gii > 0. A reciprocal frame is
deﬁned by the condition

(8)

−

gα

gβ = δα

β.

·

Deﬁning gαβ as the inverse of gαβ, the matrix product
of the two must be the identity matrix; using Einstein’s
summation convention this is

1,

(σ0)2 =
−
(σi)2 = 1,
σα ·

σβ = 0, α

= β.

(5)

gαγgβγ = δα

β.

Using the deﬁnition (8) we have

Note that the English characters i, j, k range from 1 to
4 while the Greek characters α, β, γ range from 0 to 4.
See the Appendix A for the complete notation convention
used.

Any two basis vectors can be multiplied, producing
the new entity called a bivector. This bivector is the ge-
ometric product or, quite simply, the product, and it is
distributive. Similarly to the product of two basis vec-
tors, the product of three diﬀerent basis vectors produces
a trivector and so forth up to the ﬁvevector, because ﬁve
is the dimension of space.

We will simplify the notation for basis vector products
σαβ . The algebra is

using multiple indices, i.e. σασβ ≡
32-dimensional and is spanned by the basis

The remaining basis elements square to

(σ0)2 = (σij )2 = (σijk)2 = (iσi)2 = i2 =

(7)

Note that the pseudoscalar i commutes with all the other
basis elements while being a square root of
1; this makes
it a very special element which can play the role of the
scalar imaginary in complex algebra.

In 5-dimensional

spacetime of general curvature,
spanned by 5 coordinate frame vectors gα, the indices

comparing with Eq. (9) we determine gαwith

(gαγgγ)

gβ = δα

·

gα = gαγgγ.

gα = nβ

ασβ,

If the coordinate frame vectors can be expressed as a

linear combination of the orthonormed ones, we have

where nβ
α is called the refractive index tensor or simply
the refractive index ; its 25 elements can vary from point
to point as a function of the coordinates.[2] When the
refractive index is the identity, we have gα = σα for the
main or direct frame and g0 =
σ0, gi = σi for the
reciprocal frame, so that Eq. (9) is veriﬁed. In this work
we will not consider spaces of general curvature but only
those satisfying condition (13).

−

The ﬁrst use we will make of the reciprocal frame is for
the deﬁnition of two derivative operators. In ﬂat space
we deﬁne the vector derivative

= σα∂α.

∇

(14)

It will be convenient, sometimes, to use vector derivatives
in subspaces of 5D space; these will be denoted by an
upper index before the
and the particular index used
determines the subspace to which the derivative applies;
= σm∂m = σ1∂1 + σ2∂2 + σ3∂3. In
For instance m
5-dimensional space it will be useful to split the vector
derivative into its time and 4-dimensional parts

∇

∇

=

∇

−

σ0∂t + σi∂i =

σ0∂t + i

(15)

−

.
∇

The second derivative operator is the covariant deriva-
tive, sometimes called the Dirac operator, and it is de-
ﬁned in the reciprocal frame gα

D = gα∂α.

(16)

6
Taking into account the deﬁnition of the reciprocal frame
(9), we see that the covariant derivative is also a vector.
In cases such as those we consider in this work, where
there is a refractive index, it will be possible to deﬁne
both derivatives in the same space.

We deﬁne also second order diﬀerential operators, des-
ignated Laplacian and covariant Laplacian respectively,
resulting from the inner product of one derivative opera-
tor by itself. The square of a vector is always a scalar and
the vector derivative is no exception, so the Laplacian is
a scalar operator, which consequently acts separately in
each component of a multivector. For 4 + 1 ﬂat space it
is

2 =

This procedure was used in Ref. [1] for the derivation
of special relativity and will be extended here to general
curved spaces.

III. THE MONOGENIC CONDITION

There is a class of functions of great importance, called
monogenic functions[6], characterized by having null vec-
tor derivative; a function ψ is monogenic in ﬂat space if
and only if

ψ = 0.

∇

(19)

A monogenic function is not usually a scalar and has by
necessity null Laplacian, as can be seen by dotting Eq.
(19) with
on the left. We are then led to Eq. (18),
which can also be written as

∇

3

with the covariant derivative D. A generalized mono-
∇
genic function is then a function that veriﬁes the equation

Dψ = 0.

(23)

Similarly to what happens in ﬂat space, the covariant
Laplacian is a scalar and a monogenic function must ver-
ify the second order diﬀerential equation

D2ψ = 0.

(24)

It is possible to write a general expression for the covari-
ant Laplacian in terms of the metric tensor components
(see [9, Section 2.11]) but we will consider only situations
where that complete general expression is not needed.

When Eq. (23) is multiplied on the left by D, we are
applying second derivatives to the function, but we are
simultaneously applying ﬁrst order derivatives to the re-
ciprocal frame vectors present in the deﬁnition of D itself.
We can simplify the calculations if the variations of the
frame vectors are taken to be much slower than those of
function ψ so that frame vector derivatives can be ne-
glected. With this approximation, the covariant Lapla-
cian becomes D2 = gαβ∂αβ and Eq. (24) can be written

gαβ∂αβψ = 0.

(25)

This equation can have a solution of the type given by
Eq. (21) if again the derivatives of pα are neglected. This
approximation is usually of the same order as the former
one and should not be seen as a second restriction. In-
serting Eq. (21) one sees that it is a solution if

gαβpαpβ = 0.

(26)

This equation means that the square of vector p = gαpα
is zero, that is, p is a vector of zero length and is called a
null vector or nilpotent. Vector p is the momentum vector
and should not be confused with 4-dimensional conjugate
momentum vectors deﬁned below.

This relation can be recognized as a wave equation in the
4-dimensional space spanned by the σi which will accept
plane wave type solutions of the general form

∂iiψ = ∂00ψ.

When working in curved spaces the monogenic condi-
tion is naturally modiﬁed, replacing the vector derivative

(20)

IV. EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN 4DO AND GTR
SPACES

(21)

(22)

By setting the argument of ψ constant in Eq. (21) and

diﬀerentiating we can get the diﬀerential equation

pαdxα = 0.

(27)

·

The lhs can equivalently be written as the inner product
dx = 0, where dx = gβdxβ is a
of the two vectors p
general 5D elementary displacement. In 5D hyperbolic
space the inner product of two vectors can be null when
the vectors are perpendicular but also when the two vec-
tors are null. Since we have established that p is a null
vector, Eq. (27) can be satisﬁed either by dx normal to
p or by (dx)2 = 0. In the former case the condition de-
scribes a 3-volume called wavefront and in the latter case
it describes the wave motion. Notice that the wavefronts

4

are not surfaces but volumes, because we are working
with 4-dimensional waves.

The condition describing 4D wave motion can be ex-

panded as

We have now projected onto 4-dimensional space with
signature (+
), known as Minkowski signature. In
order to check this consider again the special case with
g0 = σ0 and the equation becomes

− −−

gαβdxαdxβ = 0.

(28)

This condition eﬀectively reduces the spatial dimension
to four but the resulting space is non-metric because all
displacements have zero length. We will remove this dif-
ﬁculty by considering two special cases. First let us as-
sume that vector g0 is normal to the other frame vectors
so that all g0i factors are zeroed; condition (28) becomes

g00(dx0)2 + gijdxidxj = 0.

(29)

All the terms in this equation are scalars and we are
allowed to rewrite it with (dx0)2 in the lhs

(dx0)2 =

dxidxj.

(30)

gij
g00

−

We could have arrived at the same result by deﬁning a
4-dimensional displacement vector

dx0v = −

gidxi;

1
√g00

and then squaring it to evaluate its length; v is a unit
vector called velocity because its deﬁnition is similar to
the usual deﬁnition of 3-dimensional velocity; its compo-
nents are

vi =

dxi
dx0 .

v = ˜Rσ4R.

Being unitary, the velocity can be obtained by a rotation
of the σ4 frame vector

The rotation angle is a measure of the 3-dimensional ve-
locity component. A null angle corresponds to v directed
along σ4 and null 3D component, while a π/2 angle cor-
responds to the maximum possible 3D component. The
idea that physical velocity can be seen as the 3D compo-
nent of a unitary 4D vector has been explored in several
papers but see [10].

Equation (31) projects the original 5-dimensional space
into a space with 4 dimensions, with Euclidean signature,
where an elementary displacement is given by the varia-
tion of coordinate x0. In the particular case where g0 =
σ0 the displacement vector simpliﬁes to dx0v = gidxi
and we can see clearly that the signature is Euclidean
because the four gi have positive norm. Although it has
not been mentioned, we have assumed that none of the
frame vectors is a function of coordinate x0.

Returning to Eq. (28) we can now impose the condition
that g4 is normal to the other frame vectors in order to
isolate (dx4)2 instead of (dx0)2, as we did before;

(dx4)2 =

dxµdxν .

(35)

the diagonal elements gii are necessarily positive, which
allows a veriﬁcation of Minkowski signature. Contrary
to what happened in the previous case, we cannot now
obtain (dx4)2 by squaring a vector but we can do it by
consideration of the bivector

dx4ν =

gµg4dxµ.

(36)

1
g44g44

p

All the products gµg4 are bivectors because we imposed
g4 to be normal to the other frame vectors. When (dx4)2
is evaluated by an inner product we notice that g0g4
has positive square while the three gmg4 have negative
square, ensuring that a Minkowski signature is obtained.
Naturally we have to impose the condition that none of
the frame vectors depends on x4. Bivector ν is such that
ν2 = νν = 1 and it can be obtained by a Lorentz trans-
formation of bivector σ04.

ν = ˜T σ04T,

(37)

where T is of the form T = exp(B) and B is a bivector
whose plane is normal to σ4. Note that T is a pure ro-
tation when the bivector plane is normal to both σ0 and
σ4.

In special relativity it is usual to work in a space
spanned by an orthonormed frame of vectors γµ such
that (γ0)2 = 1 and (γm)2 =
1, producing the desired
Minkowski signature [6]. The geometric algebra of this
space is isomorphic to the even sub-algebra of G4,1 and
so the area element dx4ν (36) can be reformulated as a
vector called relativistic 4-velocity.

Equations (30) and (34) deﬁne two alternative 4-
dimensional spaces, those of 4-dimensional optics (4DO),
with metric tensor
gij/g00 and general theory of rela-
gµν/g44, respectively;
tivity (GTR) with metric tensor
in the former x0 is an aﬃne parameter while in the lat-
ter it is x4 that takes such role. In fact Eq. (34) only
covers the spacelike part of GTR space, because (dx4)2
is necessarily non-negative. Naturally there is the limi-
tation that the frame vectors are independent of both x0
and x4, equivalent to imposing a static metric, and also
that g0i = gµ4 = 0. Provided the metric is static, the
geodesics of 4DO can be mapped one-to-one with space-
like geodesics of GTR and we can choose to work on the
space that best suits us for free fall dynamics. For a phys-
ical interpretation of geometric relations it will frequently
be convenient to assign new designations to the 5D co-
ordinates that acquire the role of aﬃne parameter in the
null subspace. We will then make the assignments x0
t
and x4
τ . Total derivatives with respect to these co-
ordinates will also receive a special notation: df /dt = ˙f

≡

≡

and df /dτ = ˇf . Special units conventions used in this
paper are detailed in appendix B.

Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we will assume that the
frame vector associated with coordinate x0 is unitary and
normal to all the others, that is g0 = σ0 and g0i = 0.
Recalling from Eq. (30), these conditions allow the def-
inition of 4DO space with metric tensor gij. Although
we could try a more general approach, we would loose
the possibility of interpreting time as a line element and
this, as we shall see, provides very interesting and novel
interpretations of physics equations.
In many cases it
is also true that g4 is normal to the other frame vec-
tors and we have seen that in those cases we can make
metric conversions between GTR and 4DO; it will be in-
teresting, however, to examine one or two situations with
non-normal g4 and so we leave this possibility open.

For the moment we will concentrate on isotropic space,
characterized by orthogonal refractive index vectors gi
whose norm can change with coordinates but is the same
for all vectors. Normally we relax this condition by ac-
cepting that the three gm must have equal norm but g4
can be diﬀerent. The reason for this relaxed isotropy is
found in the parallel we make with physics by assign-
ing dimensions 1 to 3 to physical space.
Isotropy in a
physical sense need only be concerned with these dimen-
sions and ignores what happens with dimension 4. We
will therefore characterize an isotropic space by the re-
fractive index frame g0 = σ0, gm = nrσm, g4 = n4σ4.
Indeed we could also accept a non-orthogonal g4 within
the relaxed isotropy concept but we will not do so for the
moment.

Equation (30) can now be written in terms of the

isotropic refractive indices as

dt2 = (nr)2

(dxm)2 + (n4dτ )2.

(38)

m
X

Spherically symmetric static metrics play a special role;
this means that the refractive index can be expressed as
functions of r if we adopt spherical coordinates. The
previous equation then becomes

As we stated in the introduction, the usual form of
Schwarzschild’s metric is given by Eq. (1) but a more
interesting, isotropic form is the one in Eq. (3). The
latter can be compared to Eq. (40) allowing the deriva-
tion of the refractive indices in Eqs. (4). These refrac-
tive indices provide a 4DO Euclidean space equivalent

(cid:18)

to Schwarzschild metric, allowing 4DO to be used as an
alternative to GTR. Recalling that we derived trajecto-
ries from solutions (21) of a 4-dimensional wave equation
(28), it becomes clear that orbits can also be seen as 4-
dimensional guided waves by what could be described as
a 4-dimensional optical ﬁbre. Modes are to be expected
in these waveguides and we shall say something about
them later on.

V. FERMAT’S PRINCIPLE IN 4 DIMENSIONS

Fermat’s principle applies to optics and states that
the path followed by a light ray is the one that makes
the travel time an extremum; usually it is the path that
minimizes the time but in some cases a ray can follow a
path of maximum or stationary time. These solutions are
usually unstable, so one takes the view that light must
follow the quickest path. In Eq. (30) we have deﬁned a
time interval associated with a 4-dimensional elementary
displacement, which allows us to determine, by integra-
tion, a travel time associated with displacements of any
size along a given 4-dimensional path. We can then ex-
tend Fermat’s principle to 4D and impose an extremum
requirement in order to select a privileged path between
any two 4D points. Taking the square root to Eq. (30)

Time has to remain stationary against any small
change of path; therefore we envisage a slightly distorted
path deﬁned by functions xi(t) + εχi(t), where ε is arbi-
trarily small and χi(t) are functions that specify distor-
tion. Since the distortion must not aﬀect the end points,
the distortion functions must vanish at those points. The
time integral will now be a function of ε and we require
that

these are called the Euler-Lagrange equations.

Consideration of Eqs. (31) and (34) allows us to con-
clude that the Lagrangian deﬁned by (43) can also be
written as L = v2/2 and must always equal 1/2. From
the Lagrangian one deﬁnes immediately the conjugate

by virtue of Eq. (22) it is also

The Euler-Lagrange equations (51) can now be given

˙vi = ∂iL.

This set of four equations deﬁnes trajectories of minimum
time in 4DO space as long as the frame vectors gα are
known everywhere, independently of the fact that they
may or may not be referred to the orthonormed frame
via a refractive index. By deﬁnition these trajectories
are the geodesics of 4DO space, spanned by frame vectors
gi/√

g00, with metric tensor

gij/g00.

Following an exactly similar procedure we can ﬁnd tra-
jectories which extremize proper time, deﬁned by taking
the positive square root of Eq. (34). The Lagrangian is

a method for one-to-one geodesic mapping between 4DO
and spacelike GTR. Recalling the conditions for this
mapping to be valid, all the frame vectors must be in-
dependent of both t and τ and g0 and g4 must be normal
to the other 3 frame vectors. In tensor terms, all the gαβ
must be independent from t and τ and g0i = gµ4 = 0.”

VI. THE SOURCES OF REFRACTIVE INDEX

The set of 4 equations (56) deﬁnes the geodesics of 4DO
space; particularly in cases where there is a refractive
index, it deﬁnes trajectories of minimum time but does
not tell us anything about what produces the refractive
index in the ﬁrst place. Similarly the set of equations
(59) deﬁnes the geodesics of GTR space without telling
us what shapes space. In order to analyse this question

(53)

we must return to the general case of a refractive frame
gα without other impositions besides the existence of a
refractive index.

Considering the momentum vector

p = pαgα = pαnβ

ασβ,

γnβ

with nα
Using Eq. (D4)

γ = δβ

α, we will now take its time derivative.

˙p = ˙x

(Dp) = ˙x

G.

·

·

By a suitable choice of coordinates we can always have
g0 = σ0. We can then invoke the fact that for an elemen-
tary particle in ﬂat space the momentum vector com-
ponents can be associated with the concepts of energy,
3D momentum and rest mass as p = Eσ0 + p + mσ4
(see [1, 11] and Sec. VIII.)
If this consequence is ex-
tended to curved space and to mass distributions, we
write p = Eσ0 + p + mg4, where now E is energy den-
sity, p = pmgm is 3D momentum density and m is mass
density. The previous equation then becomes

˙Eσ0 + ˙p + m ˙g4 = ˙x

G.

·

When the Laplacian is applied to the momentum vec-

tor the result is still necessarily a vector

(60)

(61)

(62)

(63)

D2p = S.

Vector S is called the sources vector and can be expanded
into 25 terms as

S = (D2nβ

α)σβpα = Sβ

ασβpα;

(64)

where pα = gαβpβ. Tensor Sα
β contains the coeﬃcients
of the sources vector and we call it the sources tensor.
The sources tensor inﬂuences the shape of geodesics as
we shall see in one particularly important situation. One
important consequence that we don’t pursue here is that
by zeroing the sources vector one obtains the wave equa-
tion D2p = 0, which accepts gravitational wave solutions.
If σ0 is normal to the other frame vectors we can write
p = E(σ0 + v) in the reciprocal frame, with v a unit
vector or p = E(
σ0 + v) in the direct frame. Equation
(61) can then be given the form

−

˙E(σ0 + v) + E ˙v = σ0 + v

G.

(65)

·

Since G can have scalar and bivector components, the
scalar part must be responsible for the energy change,
while the bivector part rotates the velocity v. The bivec-
p, which allows a sim-
tor part of G is generated by D
pliﬁcation of the previous equation to

∧

˙v = v

(D

v),

(66)

if the frame vectors are independent of t. This equation is
exactly equivalent to the set of Euler-Lagrange equations
(56) but it was derived in a way which tells us when to
expect geodesic movement or free fall.

(68)

(69)

We will now investigate spherically symmetric solu-
tions in isotropic conditions deﬁned by Eq. (39); this
means that the refractive index can be expressed as func-
tions of r. The vector derivative in spherical coordinates
is of course

The search for solutions of Eq. (63) must necessarily
start with vanishing second member, a zero sources situ-
ation, which one would implicitly assign to vacuum; this
is a wrong assumption as we will show. Zeroing the sec-
ond member implies that the Laplacian of both nr and
n4 must be zero; considering that they are functions of r
we get the following equation for nr

which produces the solution n4 = nr. So space must
be truly isotropic and not relaxed isotropic as we had
allowed. The solution we have found for the refractive
index components in isotropic space can correctly model
Newton dynamics, which led the author to adhere to it
for some time [10]. However if inserted into Eq. (34)
this solution produces a GTR metric which is veriﬁably
in disagreement with observations; consequently it has
purely geometric signiﬁcance.

The inadequacy of the isotropic solution found above
for relativistic predictions deserves some thought, so that

we can search for solutions guided by the results that are
expected to have physical signiﬁcance.
In the physical
world we are never in a situation of zero sources because
the shape of space or the existence of a refractive index
must always be tested with a test particle. A test particle
is an abstraction corresponding to a point mass consid-
ered so small as to have no inﬂuence on the shape of
space; in reality a point particle is a black hole in GTR,
although this fact is always overlooked. A test particle
must be seen as source of refractive index itself and its
inﬂuence on the shape of space should not be neglected
in any circumstances. If this is the case the solutions for
vanishing sources vector may have only geometric mean-
ing, with no connection to physical reality.

The question is then what should go into the second
member of Eq. (63) in order to ﬁnd physically meaning-
ful solutions. If we are testing gravity we must assume
some mass density to suﬀer gravitational inﬂuence; this is
what is usually designated as non-interacting dust, mean-
ing that some continuous distribution of non-interacting
particles follows the geodesics of space. Mass density is
expected to be associated with S4
4; on the other hand
we are assuming that this mass density is very small and
so we use ﬂat space Laplacian to evaluate it. We conse-
quently make an ad hoc proposal for the sources vector
in the second member of Eq. (63)

S =

2n4σ4.

−∇

Equation (63) becomes

D2 ˙x =

2n4σ4;

as a result the equation for nr remains unchanged but
the equation for n4 becomes

When nr is given the exponential form found above,
the solution is n4 = √nr. This can now be entered into
Eq. (34) and the coeﬃcients can be expanded in series
and compared to Schwarzschild’s for the determination
of parameter a. The ﬁnal solution, for a stationary mass
M is

nr = e2M/r,

n4 = eM/r.

(75)

The equivalent GTR space is characterized by the
quadratic form

(72)

(73)

(74)

Equation (73) can be interpreted in physical terms as
containing the essence of gravitation. When solved for
spherically symmetric solutions, as we have done, the ﬁrst
member provides the deﬁnition of a stationary gravita-
tional mass as the factor M appearing in the exponent
2n4.
and the second member deﬁnes inertial mass as
Gravitational mass is deﬁned with recourse to some par-
ticle which undergoes gravitational inﬂuence and is ani-
mated with velocity v and inertial mass cannot be deﬁned
without some ﬁeld n4 acting upon it. Complete investi-
gation of the sources tensor elements and their relation
to physical quantities is not yet done; it is believed that
16 terms of this tensor have strong links with homolo-
gous elements of stress tensor in GTR, while the others
are related to electromagnetic ﬁeld.

VII. ELECTROMAGNETISM IN 5D
SPACETIME

Maxwell’s equations can easily be written in the form
of Eq. (63) if we don’t impose the condition that g4 should
remain normal the other frame vectors; as we have seen
in section IV this has the consequence that there will be
no GTR equivalent to the equations formulated in 4DO.
We will consider the non-orthonormed reciprocal frame

deﬁned by

gµ = σµ,

g4 =

Aµσµ + σ4;

(77)

q
m

where q and m are charge and mass densities, respec-
tively, and A = Aµσµ is the electromagnetic vector po-
tential, assumed to be a function of coordinates t and xm
but independent of τ . The associated direct frame has
vectors

gµ = σµ −

q
m

Aµσ4,

g4 = σ4;

(78)

and one can easily verify that Eq. (9) is obeyed. The
momentum vector in the reciprocal frame is p = Eσ0 +
pmσm +qAµσµ +mσ4 and G in the second member of Eq.
(61) is G = qDA. We will assume D
A to be zero, as one
·
usually does in electromagnetism; also D can be replaced
by µ
because the vector potential does not depend on
τ . It is convenient to deﬁne the Faraday bivector F =
µ
A, similarly to what is done in Ref. [6]; the dynamics

Expanding in series of M/r the coeﬃcients of this metric
one would ﬁnd that the lower order terms are exactly
the same as for Schwarzschild’s and so the predictions of
the metrics are indistinguishable for small values of the
expansion variable. Montanus [12] arrives at the same
solutions with a diﬀerent reasoning; the same metric is
also due to Yilmaz [13, 14, 15].

VIII. MONOGENIC FUNCTIONS AND
QUANTUM MECHANICS

Dirac

equation has been derived from the 5-
dimensional monogenic condition in previous works [1,
11]; the motivation for returning to the subject here is
the correction of the electro-dynamics equation, which is
incorrect in the earlier paper [11] and absent in the later
one [1]. Because we are working in geometric algebra, our
quantum mechanics equations will inherit that character
but the isomorphism between the geometric algebra of
5D spacetime, G4,1, and complex algebra of 4
4 matri-
ces, M (4, C), ensures that they can be translated into
the more usual Dirac matrix formalism. The equivalence
between the two formulations has been amply demon-
strated in the two references above.

∗

Recalling the monogenic condition (19), we will now

expand it into 3 terms

(σ0∂0 + σm∂m + σ4∂4)ψ = 0.

(87)

We have already established that this equation accepts
solutions in the form of Eq. (21) and we use that to eval-
uate the derivative with respect to x4

(σ0∂0 + σm∂m −

iσ4p4)ψ = 0.

(88)

If the equation is multiplied by σ4 on the left, the ﬁrst 4
terms on the ﬁrst member acquire bivector factors of the
form σ4µ, the ﬁrst of which, σ40 squares to unity, while

9

the other 3 square to minus unity. Those bivectors be-
long to the even sub-algebra of G4,1, which is isomorphic
the the algebra of Minkowski spacetime, as we have al-
ready stated. It is perfectly legitimate to replace the said
bivector factors by Dirac matrices, as was demonstrated
in the above cited references. We can then rewrite the
monogenic condition as

(γµ∂µ + ip4)ψ = 0,

(89)

which can be immediately recognized as Dirac’s equation
if p4 is assigned to the particle’s rest mass. The mono-
genic function given by Eq. (19) can then be given the
usual physical interpretation of a Dirac spinor

ψ = ψ0ei(Et+p·x+mτ );

(90)

where E is energy, p is 3-dimensional momentum and m
is rest mass.

In order to separate left and right spinor components
we use a technique adapted from Ref. 6. We choose
an arbitrary base element which squares to identity, for
instance σ4, with which we form the two idempotents
(1 + σ4)/2 and (1
σ4)/2. The name idempotents
means that they reproduce themselves when squared.
These idempotents absorb any σ4 factor; as can be easily
checked (1 + σ4)σ4 = (1 + σ4) and (1
σ4).
−
Obviously we can decompose the wavefunction ψ as

σ4)σ4 =

(1

−

−

−

ψ = ψ

1 + σ4
2

+ ψ

1

σ4

−
2

= ψ+ + ψ−.

(91)

This apparently trivial decomposition produces some sur-
prising results due to the following relations

eiθ(1 + σ4) = (cos θ + i sin θ)(1 + σ4)

= (1 cos θ + iσ4 sin θ)(1 + σ4)
= eiσ4θ(1 + σ4).

(92)

and similarly

eiθ(1

σ4) = e−iσ4θ(1

σ4).

(93)

−

−

We could have chosen other idempotents, which would
produce similar results. The available idempotents gen-
erate an SU (4) group and it has been argued that they
may be related to diﬀerent elementary particles.[11]

Electrodynamics can now be implemented in the the
same way used in Sec. VII to implement classical elec-
tromagnetism. The monogenic condition must now be
established with the covariant derivative given by Eq.
(84)

σµ∂µψ +

Aµσµ

∂4ψ = 0.

m

Multiplying on the left by σ4 and taking ∂4ψ = imψ

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

[γµ(∂µ + iqAµ) + im] ψ = 0.

(95)

This equation can be compared to what is found in any
quantum mechanics textbook..

It is now adequate to say a few words about quantiza-
tion, which is inherent to 5D monogenic functions. We
have already seen that these functions are 4-dimensional
waves, that is, they have 3-dimensional wavefronts nor-
mal to the direction of propagation. Whenever the re-
fractive index distribution traps one of these waves a 4-
dimensional waveguide is produced, which has its own
allowed propagating modes. In the particular case of a
central potential, be it an atom’s or a galaxy’s nucleus,
we expect spherical harmonic modes, which produce the
well known electron orbitals in the atom and have un-
known manifestations in a galaxy.

IX. CONCLUSION

Every physicist dreams of ﬁnding a uniﬁed formula-
tion for the fundamental laws of physics.
It is usually
accepted that in order to achieve such objective a new
paradigm is needed, meaning that one must surely step
back from accepted physics principles and start afresh
from new simpler ones. Ideally one should have a small
set of principles, valid for all areas of physics, and all the
important relations should ﬂow naturally from mathe-
matical reasoning.

In this paper we extend a proposal previously made
in that direction, that one should accept 5-dimensional
spacetime as the adequate space to formulate the laws
of physics and introduce in this space the condition of
monogeneity. We had shown in another work that this
condition is suﬃcient to arrive simultaneously at special
relativity and the free particle Dirac equation; here we
show that by generalizing the monogenic condition to
bent spaces one is able to obtain relativistic dynamics not
entirely coincident with GTR but also electrodynamics,
both classical and quantized.

Maxwell’s equations were also derived from the mono-
genic condition and were uniﬁed to the equations respon-
sible for gravitational dynamics. The procedure is not yet
entirely satisfactory, in the sense that an ad hoc proposal
had to be made in respect to inertial mass; in future work
we hope to ﬁnd a suitable formulation for the derivation
of curvature from ﬁrst principles.

range {1, 4} we will use Latin letters i, j, k and ﬁnally for in-
dices in the range {1, 3} we will use also Latin letters chosen
from m, n, o.

APPENDIX B: NON-DIMENSIONAL UNITS

The interpretation of t and τ as time coordinates im-
plies the use of a scale parameter which is naturally cho-
sen as the vacuum speed of light c. We don’t need to
include this constant in our equations because we can
always recover time intervals, if needed, introducing the
speed of light at a later stage. We can even go a step fur-
ther and eliminate all units from our equations so that
they become pure number equations; in this way we will
avoid cumbersome constants whenever coordinates have
to appear as arguments of exponentials or trigonomet-
ric functions. We note that, at least for the macroscopic
world, physical units can all be reduced to four funda-
mental ones; we can, for instance, choose length, time,
mass and electric charge as fundamental, as we could
just as well have chosen others. Measurements are then
made by comparison with standards; of course we need
four standards, one for each fundamental unit. But now
note that there are four fundamental constants: Planck
constant (¯h), gravitational constant (G), speed of light
in vacuum (c) and proton electric charge (e), with which
we can build four standards for the fundamental units.
Table I lists the standards of this units’ system, fre-

APPENDIX A: INDEXING CONVENTIONS

In this section we establish the indexing conventions
used in the paper. We deal with 5-dimensional space
but we are also interested in two of its 4-dimensional
subspaces and one 3-dimensional subspace; ideally our
choice of indices should clearly identify their ranges in
order to avoid the need to specify the latter in every
equation. The diagram in Fig. 1 shows the index naming
convention used in this paper; Einstein’s summation con-
vention will be adopted as well as the compact notation
for partial derivatives ∂α = ∂/∂xα.

quently called Planck units, which the authors prefer to
designate by non-dimensional units.
In this system all
the fundamental constants, ¯h, G, c, e, become unity, a
particle’s Compton frequency, deﬁned by ν = mc2/¯h, be-
comes equal to the particle’s mass and the frequent term
GM /(c2r) is simpliﬁed to M/r. We can, in fact, take
all measures to be non-dimensional, since the standards
are deﬁned with recourse to universal constants; this will
be our posture. Geometry and physics become relations
between pure numbers, vectors, bivectors, etc. and the
geometric concept of distance is needed only for graphical
representation.

APPENDIX C: SOME COMPLEMENTS OF
GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

In this section we expand the concepts given in Sec. II,
introducing some useful relations and deﬁnitions. Start-
ing with the basis elements that square to unity Eq. (6),
repeated here,

(σi)2 = (σ0i)2 = (σ0ij )2 = (iσ0)2 = 1,

(C1)

it is easy to verify any of the above equations; sup-
pose we want to check that (σ0ij )2 = 1. Start by ex-
panding the square and remove the compact notation
(σ0ij )2 = σ0σiσjσ0σiσj , then swap the last σj twice to
bring it next to its homonymous; each swap changes the
sign, so an even number of swaps preserves the sign:
(σ0ij )2 = σ0σi(σj)2σ0σi. From the third equation (5)
we know that the squared vector is unity and we get suc-
cessively (σ0ij )2 = σ0σiσ0σi =
(σ0)2;
using the ﬁrst equation (5) we get ﬁnally (σ0ij )2 = 1 as
desired.

(σ0)2(σi)2 =

The remaining basis elements square to

1 as can be

veriﬁed in a similar manner, Eq. (7):

Note that the pseudoscalar i commutes with all the other
basis elements while being a square root of
1; this makes
it a very special element which can play the role of the
scalar imaginary in complex algebra.

The inner product is the same as the usual ”dot prod-

the a0b0 term; this is to be expected and is similar to
what one ﬁnds in special relativity. The outer prod-
uct represents an oriented area;
in Euclidean 3-space
it can be linked to the ”cross product” by the relation
cross(a, b) =

acters for 3-dimensional vectors and avoided deﬁning a
symbol for the cross product because we will not use it

When a vector is operated with a multivector the inner
product reduces the grade of each element by one unit
and the outer product increases the grade by one. We
will generalize the deﬁnition of inner and outer products
below; under this generalized deﬁnition the inner product
between a vector and a scalar produces a vector. Given
a multivector a we refer to its grade-r part by writing
< a >r; the scalar or grade zero part is simply designated
as < a >. By operating a vector with itself we obtain a
scalar equal to the square of the vector’s length

In mixed product expressions we will use the convention
that inner and outer products take precedence over geo-
metric products.

We will encounter exponentials with multivector expo-
nents; two particular cases of exponentiation are specially
important. If u is such that u2 =

The exponential of bivectors is useful for deﬁning rota-
tions; a rotation of vector a by angle θ on the σ12 plane
is performed by

a′ = eσ21θ/2aeσ12θ/2 = ˜RaR;

Similarly, if we had made a = σ2, the result would have

The rotation angle is
and the rotation plane is deﬁned
by B. A rotor is deﬁned as a unitary even multivector
(a multivector with even grade components only) which
squares to unity; we are particularly interested in rotors
with bivector components. It is more general to deﬁne
a rotation by a plane (bivector) then by an axis (vector)
because the latter only works in 3D while the former is
applicable in any dimension. When the plane of bivector
B contains σ0, a similar operation does not produce a
rotation but produces a boost instead. Take for instance
B = σ01θ/2 and deﬁne the transformation operator T =
exp(B); a transformation of the basis vector σ0 produces

a′ = ˜T σ0T = e−σ01θ/2σ0eσ01θ/2

If there is a refractive index the wave displacement

vector can be written as

dx = gαdxα = nβ

ασβdxα.

(D1)

Because this vector is nilpotent, by virtue of Eq. (29), the
ﬁve coordinates are not independent and we can divide
both members by dx0 = dt deﬁning the nilpotent vector

˙x = g0 + gi ˙xi = nα

0σα + nβ

iσβ ˙xi.

(D2)

Suppose we have a 5D vector a = σαaα and we want
to ﬁnd its time derivative along a path parameterized by
t, that is all the xi are functions of t. We can write

˙a = ∂βaα ˙xβ σα;
(D3)
where naturally ˙x0 = 1. Remembering the deﬁnition of
covariant derivative (16) and Eq. (D2) we can modify this
equation to

˙a = ˙xβgβ ·

gβ∂βaασα = ˙x

(Da).

(D4)

·

We have expressed vector a in terms of the orthonormed
frame in order to avoid vector derivatives but the result
must be independent of the chosen frame.

This procedure has an obvious dual, which we arrive

at by deﬁning

The proper time derivative of vector a is then

ˇx = gµ ˇxµ + g4.

ˇa = ˇx

(Da).

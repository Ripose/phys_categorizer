In [1] Anandan has presented a covariant treatment of the interaction of the electric and magnetic dipole moments
of a particle with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Our aim is to make some important changes of the results from [1].
Instead of dealing with component form of tensors Eµ, ..
[1], we shall deal with tensors as four-dimensional (4D)
geometric quantities, Ea, .. . For simplicity, only the standard basis {eµ; 0, 1, 2, 3} of orthonormal 4-vectors, with e0
in the forward light cone, will be used.

Anandan states: “In any frame D0i and Dij that couple, respectively, to the electric ﬁeld components F0i and the
magnetic ﬁeld components Fij are called the components of the electric and magnetic dipole moments.” Then he
deﬁnes that dµ and mµ are the components of Dµν , Eq. (2), and similarly that Eµ and Bµ are the components of
F µν , Eq. (4). Several objections can be raised to such treatment.

It is proved in [2] that the primary quantity for the whole electromagnetism is F ab (i.e., in [2] the bivector F ). F ab
can be decomposed as F ab = (1/c)(Eavb − Ebva) + εabcdBcvd, whence Ea = (1/c)F abvb and Ba = (1/2c2)εabcdFbcvd,
with Eava = Bava = 0; only three components of Ea and Ba in any basis are independent. The 4-velocity va is
interpreted as the velocity of a family of observers who measures Ea and Ba ﬁelds. Ea and Ba depend not only on
F ab but on va as well. In the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, in which the observers who measure Ea, Ba are at rest,
va = ce0. That frame with the {eµ} basis will be called the e0-frame. In the e0-frame E0 = B0 = 0 and Ei = F i0,
Bi = (1/2c)εijk0Fjk. In any other inertial frame the “ﬁducial” observers are moving and va = ce0 = v′µe′
µ; under the
passive Lorentz transformations (LT) vµeµ transforms as any other 4-vector transforms. The same holds for Ea and
Ba, e.g., Ea = Eµeµ = ((1/c)F i0v0)ei = E′µe′
µ. Eµ transform by the LT again to the components
E′µ of the same electric ﬁeld. There is no mixing with the components of the magnetic ﬁeld. E′µ are not determined
only by F ′µν than also by v′µ.

µ = ((1/c)F ′µνv′

Only in the e0-frame, and thus not in any frame, F i0 and F jk are the electric and magnetic ﬁeld components
respectively. The assertion that, e.g., in any inertial frame it holds that, E0 = E′0 = 0, Ei = F i0 and E′i = F ′i0,
leads to the usual transformations of the 3-vector E, see, e.g., [3], Eq. (11.149). In [4] the fundamental results are
achieved that these usual transformations of the 3-vectors E and B are not relativistically correct and have to be
replaced by the LT of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds as 4D geometric quantities.

ν )e′

The electric and magnetic dipole moment 4-vectors da and ma respectively can be determined from dipole moment
tensor Dab in the same way as Ea and Ba are obtained from F ab; Dab = (1/c)(uadb −ubda)+(1/c2)εabcducmd, whence
da = (1/c)Dbaub, and ma = (1/2)εabcdDbcud, with daua = maua = 0. ua = dxa/ds is the 4-velocity of the particle.

The whole discussion about Ea, Ba and F ab can be repeated for da, ma and Dab. Now, only in the rest frame of

the particle and the {eµ} basis, ua = ce0 and d0 = m0 = 0, di = D0i, mi = (c/2)εijk0Djk.

It is also stated in [1]: “The electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the rest frame ...

.” But, there is no rest frame
for ﬁelds. The whole discussion in [1] has to be changed using diﬀerent 4-velocities va and ua. Thus Eqs.
(7)
and (6) become (1/2)FabDba = (1/c)Daua + (1/c2)Maua, and Da = dbFba, Ma = mbF ∗
ba. Instead of Eq. (5) we
have that (1/2)FabDba is the sum of two terms (1/c2)[((Eada) − (Bama))(vbub) − (Eaua)(vbdb) + (Baua)(vbmb)] and
(1/c3)[εabcd(vaEbucmd + c2daubBcvd)]; the second term contains the interaction of Ea with ma, and Ba with da. This
last result signiﬁcantly inﬂuences Eq. (17) and it will give new interpretations for, e.g., the Aharonov-Casher and the
R¨ontgen phase shifts.

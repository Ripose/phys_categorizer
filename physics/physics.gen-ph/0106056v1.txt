A Longshot Technique for Resurrecting the Dead by Reversing the
Flow of Time

Reversing the ﬂow of time between Casimir plates raises the question of whether or
not a recently deceased, intact organism could be brought back to life. The odds are
not good.

According to special relativity, a “stationary” observer would determine the energy

content of a mass moving with constant relative velocity to be

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

That same observer would also ﬁnd

E = mc2 =

mo
1 − v2
c2

c2 .







q

∆t = ∆to

1 − v2
c2 ,

s

where ∆t represents the number of seconds that goes by on the moving mass, and
∆to is the number of seconds that goes by in the stationary frame.

Multiplying equation (2) by equation (1) results in

E∆t =

moc2

∆to = Eo∆to .

(cid:17)
Evidently the energy time-ﬂow product is invariant under special relativity such that

(cid:16)

from frame to frame.

E1∆t1 = E2∆t2

Equation (4) also applies to a photon leaving a Schwarzschild metric, and two
possibilities come to mind. Either equation (4) is universally applicable (i.e.- beyond
the conﬁnes of special relativity), or there must be two diﬀerent kinds of energy; the
kind that is accompanied by time dilation, and the kind that is not accompanied by
time dilation.

If equation (4) does apply everywhere, and if the energy density between Casimir
plates is truly negative, then it may be possible to reverse the ﬂow of time between
Casimir plates in accordance with1

E1∆t1 = (−E2) (−∆t2) .

(5)

That possibility brings to mind an interesting question. Suppose some tiny bio-
logical organism - small enough to ﬁt between the two plates - was allowed to expire
from “old age”. Could that organism then be brought back to life by immediately
placing it in the region of negative time ﬂow between the plates ?.

Several considerations argue against this happening. For one thing, the energy
density of the dead organism would still be positive, even though the organism was
immersed in a region of negative energy density. So time might still ﬂow forwards
inside the organism. On the other hand, the time direction probably cannot contain
jump discontinuities. There would have to be some sort of smooth transition at the
surface of the organism between the region of forward time ﬂow inside the organism,
and the region of backward time ﬂow outside the organism. So the overall efect is not
clear. Further, even if time did ﬂow backwards throughout the entire organism, there
is no guarantee that an “instant replay” eﬀect would occur. The components of the
dead organism might just get younger without “rewinding the tape” and rekindling
the spark of life.

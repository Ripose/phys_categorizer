It is shown how initial conditions can be appropriately deﬁned for the integration

of Lorentz-Dirac equations of motion. The integration is performed forward in time.

The theory is applied to the case of the motion of an electron in an intense laser pulse,

relevant to nonlinear Compton scattering.

The advent of a new generation of extremely high power lasers that uses chirped pulse ampliﬁcation

has put into focus the classical description of the dynamics of relativistic electrons. Under the action of

high intensity electromagnetic ﬁeld, a major ingredient of the dynamics is the electron self-interaction

which implies in the damping of the movement caused by the interaction of the charge with its own

ﬁeld. The derivation of the damping force has been reviewed recently [1] revealing its relativistic origin

asociated to the asymmetry introduced by the Doppler eﬀect in the forward and backward emission

of radiation. The inclusion of this force in the equation of motion leads to the nonlinear covariant

Lorentz-Dirac(LD) equation [2] for a point charge.

Nonlinear eﬀects have been observed in recent experiments with intense-laser relativistic-electron

scattering at laser frequencies and ﬁeld strengths where radiation reaction forces begin to become

signiﬁcant [3,4]. Relativistic nonlinear Thompson scattering has also been observed [5]. These ex-

periments justify the recent attention the classical electrodynamics theory(CED) has received. A

self-consistent classical theoretical treatment of the radiative reaction force would also be useful in

simulating future electron accelerators [6]. Further, the kind of study reported upon in this paper

may be useful in the quantal treatment [7].

A certain number of problems, conceptual and practical, is known to be associated with LD equation.

These diﬃculties may be traced to the fact that it contains a dependence on the derivative of the

acceleration which implies in the necessity of imposing, in order to solve it, an extra condition besides

the usual initial conditions on position and velocity of classical mechanics. It has been estabilished

by Rohrlich that this condition is given by the asymptotic constraint that at the far future, when

the ﬁelds vanish, the acceleration should also vanish. The solution which is obtained however, when

extrapolated to the instant when the external force is applied violates causality. On the other hand,

from the practical point of view, a condition put in the far future is awkward to be implemented

specially in a scattering situation.

A recent book [8] has been devoted to this question of causality violation. A clear explanation to

its origin was given and it has been shown how it can be solved in the context of the CED. On the

other side, attempts has been done in order to replace Rohrlich condition by an equivalent initial

condition [9,10]. The purpose of this letter is to apply these modern advances, to the case of the

classical description based in LD equation, of the movement of an electron interacting with a short,

strong laser pulse. This problem has been recently discussed in the literature Ref. [3], which provided

numerical solutions of the Lorentz-Dirac equation. The integration was performed backwards in time

so that the unphysical, exponentially growing homogeneous solutions of LD would damp out, resulting

in a numerical stable solution.

We are going to show that Lorentz-Dirac equation of motion can be integrated forward in time with

conditions speciﬁed at t = 0. The idea is to construct the series solution of LD equation. The initial

acceleration is then provided by replacing in the series the velocity by their initial value at the instant

when the external force is applied. It is easy to show that the solution obtained with this procedure,

when extrapolated to the distant future, satisﬁes Rohrlich condition. However, we still have to cope

with the existence of the unphysical runaway solutions which although formally eliminated troubles

2

the process of numerical integration. Then, by combining the recursive use of the series solution with

implicit methods of numerical integration we show that the process of integration forward in time can

be performed.

We write Lorentz-Dirac (LD) equation of motion as

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where vµ,aµ and F ext

10−23s is the Compton time scale.

×

We are assuming that the external force applies at τ = 0 and the second term in the right hand side

of the equation represents the damping force arising as the charge starts to radiate [11].

By contracting the Lorentz-Dirac equation with aµ, it is found that (aµaµ) (τ ) = C exp(2τ /ǫ) is a

solution of the resulting homogeneous equation (no external force) for times greater than τ0. These are

the so-called runaway solutions. They are eliminated by imposing the Dirac-Rohrlich (DR) condition

In contrast to the usual initial value problem encountered in classical physics, where all quantities,

position, velocity, are ﬁxed at t = 0, the above asymptotic condition, Eq. (5) recast the problem

into a boundary value one where the x, v are known at τ = 0 and a is forced to be zero at τ =

, in accordance with the condition on the force, Eq. (6). A particular situation is that of Ref.

∞

[3], in which the problem was solved in the rest frame of the particle at some future time with

three ﬁnal homogeneous conditions. In both situations however, the numerical integration has to be

performed backwards in time. Although this procedure eliminates the unphysical runway solutions, it

is uncomfortable, from the point of view of applications, to have a condition given at some ﬁnal time.

It is therefore desirable to have an equivalent condition on the acceleration deﬁned at the initial time.

For an electron moving in an electromagnetic ﬁeld the external force is given by

F ext

µ =

(∂νAµ −

−

∂µAν )vν

where the quantity Aµ is the vector potential given in units of m0c/e. For a linearly polarized laser

pulse,

Aµ ≡

(Φ/c, A), A = ˆxAx(φ), Φ = 0

which is a function of the invariant phase of the traveling wave,

φ = kµxµ(τ ) = x0 −

z ,

where kµ = (1, 0, 0, 1) is the dimensionless laser wave number.

Following Ref. [3] we use φ as the independent variable to recast the Dirac Lorentz equation as

In Ref. [3], by specifying ﬁnal homogeneous conditions on the acceleration and the velocity and

then integrating backward in time, the solution to these equations were obtained at all times. We now

want to show that this problem can also be solved by specifying initial conditions on the motion and

integrating forward in time.

For the “initial” velocity of our method, we use the ﬁnal velocity of the backward integration method

of [3]. As for the initial acceleration we employ the ﬁrst terms of the series generated by expanding

the equations of motion, in terms of the small quantity ε = ω0τ0. To obtain this series we write the

two components of the equations of motion (16) and (17) as

From the above equations we derive the zeroth order for the derivatives of the components of the

expressions inserted in equations (21) and (22) , we obtain the next order approximation for the

acceleration. This process can be repeated to generate higher order corrections as desired.

The forward integration using this above procedure for the initial acceleration was performed using

the subroutine Stiﬀs taken from the Numerical Recipes. The eﬃciency of the procedure is highly

6

improved when this perturbative expression of the acceleration is recurrently used at each step of the

integration process. The results of the numerical calculations are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively,

for the transversal and longitudinal components of the momentum. The parameters are A = 1,

ǫ = 0.05 and ∆φ = 10. These results are identical to those obtained in Ref. [3] using the backward

integration method.

In conclusion, it has been shown that LD equation can be integrated forward in time with an

appropriate acceleration initial condition. This acceleration is provided by the equation of motion

itself, treating the radiation damping term as a perturbation. This peculiar behaviour of LD equation

stems from the fact that although the self-interaction term turns it into a third-order diﬀerential

equation, only its particular solution is physically meaningful: all homogeneous solutions have to

be excluded. This constraint makes the solution unique. We have discussed the forward numerical

integration procedure in the important case of the nonlinear Compton scattering. The essential feature

of the calculations is the crucial role played by the recurrent use of the perturbative series expansion of

the acceleration in order to achieve stable and accurate results. We may conclude that the ﬁnal Dirac-

Rohrlich constraint can indeed be replaced by an equivalent initial condition as long as the radiation

damping term can be treated as a local perturbation in the iterative solution of the equation of motion.

This does not mean that nonlinear eﬀects have been neglected. Indeed, by perturbatively iterating the

equation of motion, a local expression for the acceleration is generated, in which the radiation aﬀects

the motion as much as it is aﬀected by it. The results presented here clearly show that nonlinear

LD equations can still be integrated forward in time if the appropriate, albeit unconventional, initial

conditions were utilized.

Teleparallel structures and background metric in
monocosm cosmology

Abstract

The monocosm model shows that Boolean observer will always see his
spacetime as a certain four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold of
signature 2. In this note we study the geometry of this manifold in some
detail. In particular, we compute its natural teleparallel connection, tor-
sion and background metric induced by the teleparallel communications.

(1) Introduction. The monocosm model [1] links operational logic of ratio-
nal observer with the dimensionality, possible types of metric and topology of
the spacetime he perceives. Here is the basic technical setup. Let F be a par-
tially ordered ﬁeld. An F-observer is the category A[F] of linear algebras over
F. Paradigms of an F-observer are A[F]-objects, his eﬀectors are A[F]-arrows.
For a paradigm A: (a) states of knowledge are elements of the algebra A; (b)
a sensory metric is the algebra-A structure constant tensor C(˜ω; a, b) together
with a one-form ˜t on the additive linear space SA of the algebra A, provided
C(˜t; a, b) is symmetric in vector arguments a and b; ˜t is then the sensory time;
(c) the sensory space is SA together with all the sensory metrics of the paradigm
A; elements of SA are reﬂexors; (d) the motor space is the multiplicative sub-
groupoid MA of the algebra A, generated by the set of all non-zero elements of
A. A paradigm A is (ir)rational if MA is (not) a monoid. If A is a rational
paradigm and the topos of MA realizations, MA –Set, is (not) Boolean, the
paradigm A is (non-)classical, the topos MA–Set is the proper world of A .
A classical paradigm of maximal ﬁnite dimensionality, if it exists, is a classic
paradigm.

Intuitively, we are to understand reﬂexors as elementary experiences (obser-
vations) of an individual, and, as emphasized in [1], the former are the basic
construction material for everything that follows. In the absence of restrictions
on logic, this axiomatic setup constitute a rather weak system in the sense that
there is a lot of room for pathological behavior (presence of xenomorphs), which
justiﬁes the somewhat extravagant terminology of [1]. In our case, however, i.
e. for individuals with R type psychology (F∼=R, where R is the naturally or-
dered ﬁeld of reals) and Boolean logic, a dramatic reduction of the specter of

1

possible structures takes place. For decoherent paradigms (i. e. rational ﬁnite-
dimensional paradigms of R-observer), it becomes possible to deﬁne spacetime,
as the (multiplicative) Lie group of all invertible elements of A. The main result
of [1] is that in R case the classic paradigm exists, is unique and isomorphic
to the quaternion algebra H, spacetime Ω is isomorphic ∼= R+ ⊗ SU (2), where
R+ is the multiplicative group of positive reals, and there is a unique Lorentz
sensory metric on SH, generated by a unique (up to real factor) sensory time ˜t
with components (1, 0, 0, 0) in the basis dual to the basis of the unit quaternions
1, i, j, k. Thus in the monocosm model the eﬀective four-dimensionality of, and
existence of a signature 2 metric are not axioms, as in the standard approach,
but can be deduced from a speciﬁcation of the operational logic of the observer.
n(x) and ∗en(x) on Ω in-
duced by translations of the basis 1, i, j, k, in the tangent space SH at 1∈ Ω,
along the left and right-invariant vector ﬁelds, respectively, and by its subse-
quent normalization, in the sense of quaternion norm. Since the computations
are similar, in this paper we deal only with the left-invariant ﬁelds. The frame
ﬁeld e∗
n(x) generates a natural teleparallel [2] connection on, and provides con-
tinuations, ˜t(x) and C(x), of the sensory time and structure constant tensor to
Ω. Speciﬁcally, ˜t(x) and C(x) are declared constant in this frame ﬁeld. Since
the sensory metric is contraction of ˜t and C, this guaranties that the metric is
canonical in e∗

There are two natural orthonormal frame ﬁelds e∗

n(x).

(2) Left-invariant vector ﬁelds and their integral curves in Ω. The quater-
nionic equation of the integral curves of the left-invariant vector ﬁelds over Ω
is

dx(µ)
dµ

= p0∗x(µ),

(1)

where µ is real parameter, ∗ is quaternion multiplication, x(µ) ∈ Ω, p0 ∈ SH is
the initial tangent vector to the curve (at x(0)). The basis 1, i, j, k generates
a global system of normal coordinates (xn) in Ω, in which a quaternion a1 +
bi + cj + dk has coordinates x0 = a, x1 = b, x2 = c, x3 = d. Note that xn are
not all zero, since 0 /∈ Ω. Letting the components of p0 be pn
0 in the coordinate
∂
∂xn at 1, we can present p0 in the left matrix [3] form
basis

Then (1) becomes a fourth-order linear system of ordinary diﬀerential equations:

(4) Telegravity in Ω. To compute the Christoﬀel symbols, torsion tensor and
the background metric explicitly, we make the standard teleparallel transport
declaration: a vector at x ∈ Ω is parallel (equal) to a vector at y ∈ Ω if
their components are proportional (equal) in the orthonormal frame e∗
n at those
points. In the coordinate basis

Thus obtained information about natural geometry of Ω is actually quite re-
markable: all three basic features of this simple structure connected in a unique
and unexpected way to Boolean logic - the eﬀective dimensionality, signature
and global properties of the metric - conform to the corresponding properties of
the world we currently observe.

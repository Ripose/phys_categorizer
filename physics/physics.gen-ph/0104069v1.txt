ABSTRACT: We show that for an observer in translational, rotational or gravitational

motion, a linearly polarized plane wave has two modes of propagation in a stationary,

homogeneous and isotropic medium according to Hertz’s version of Maxwell’s theory. The
ﬁrst mode is characterized by polarization at right angles to the direction of propagation

and has a phase velocity that is controlled by the material constants of the medium.
The second mode is characterized by polarization along the propagation direction and

has a phase velocity that is controlled by the motion of the observer. We outline some

applications of the second mode in emerging technologies.

Introduction

We have shown previously that in Hertz’s version of Maxwell’s theory, an electric ﬁeld D(r, t) is
described by the equations

while a magnetic ﬁeld B(r, t) is described by the equations

D = σ

H = ∂D/∂t + j

where u = dr/dt is the velocity of point r where one is observing the ﬁelds at time t and may be
loosely described as the velocity of an observer, detector or probe at this point [1]. Our purpose
in this paper is to use these equations to study the propagation of light relative to accelerated
observers (or more precisely, accelerated points of observation) in a stationary, homogeneous and
isotropic medium with constitutive equations

where ǫ and µ are independent of both time t and position r.

We are motivated to study this problem for theoretical and practical reasons. On the theo-
retical side, we need to ﬁnd experimentally testable consequences of (1c) and (2c) because these
equations represent the point of departure of Hertz’s theory from Maxwell-Einstein electrodynam-
ics of moving bodies. Also, a rigorous classical treatment of the problem has until now seemed
to be elusive, leaving many classical physicists to conjecture the validity of the galilean law of
velocity composition for translating, rotating and gravitating observers (see, for example, [2]).
This conjecture can clearly not be assumed to have unlimited validity since an electromagnetic
wave is governed by the laws of electrodynamics while a point particle for which the galilean law
is manifestly valid is not governed by such laws. It turns out that when the limits of validity
of this conjecture are properly studied, one ﬁnds that, unusual as it may seem, it is possible for
light to propagate with a velocity that depends only on the motion of the observer and not on the
permittivity or the permeability of a medium. This peculiar mode of propagation has a number
of potential applications, some of which will be highlighted in this paper.

Even without these novel applications, we have a practical motivation in the fact that light
propagation relative to accelerated observers can be used to detect acceleration in devices such as
accelerometers (for translation), ﬁberoptic gyroscopes (for rotation), gravimeters and gradiometers

(for gravitation). These devices are used in many major industries. For examples, accelerometers
are used extensively in the automotive industry, ﬁberoptic gyroscopes are essential components
of navigational systems while gravimeters and gradiometers are indispensible tools for mineral
exploration. Hence an important goal of this work is to suggest new ways of signiﬁcantly improving
the stability and sensitivity of these devices. This goal is desirable particularly for accelerometers
because the current technologies (capacitive, piezoelectric, piezoresistive, etc) used in these devices
are semi-mechanical in the sense that they require the use of a proofmass whose response to
acceleration is transduced according to Newton’s second law. Although the more recent thermal
technologies do not require a proofmass, they require a temperature-sensitive material substrate
and therefore have many of the drawbacks of the semi-mechanical methods. By providing a useable
closed-form solution to the problem of light propagation relative to accelerated observers, this work
aims to provide a basis for sensing all kinds of acceleration and acceleration gradients by ﬁberoptic
methods.

We substitute (3) into (1b) and (2b) to get, respectively,

Solutions of this equation will be sought as plane waves of the form

D = D0ei(ωt+κ·r)

where D0, ω and κ are independent of time t and position r. For waves of this form it is easy to

and from both (8b) and (6) that

D = D1ei(ω1t−κ·r), D1(t) = D0e−ω2t.

We shall characterize this plane wave by its phase velocity υp, its group velocity υg, and the time
ts required by its amplitude to decay by a factor of 1/e (called the skin time). These quantities
are deﬁned by

υp = (ω1/κ)~κ

(10a)

υg =

∇κ ω1
(10c)
ts = 1/ω2
where ~κ is a unit vector in the direction of κ. We shall not consider the situation when ω is
real and κ is complex in this paper, but the reader is encouraged to analyze this situation as an
exercise.

2 Translating Observers

We consider an observer in translational motion so that u is a function of time only, i.e.,

Using (11) and (1c), we have

u = u(t),

a(t) = ∂u/∂t.

Substituting (45) into (44) leads to the dispersion equation

3.2 Coplanar Waves (β = 0)

If ξ = 0 by (48a), then ζ = 0 by (48b) and since β = 0 for coplanar waves, the dispersion equation
is trivially satisﬁed. To obtain a nontrivial solution, we shall require that ξ
= 0. With this
condition we have from (48) that

Equation (56a) shows that a wave propagating in the positive direction (i.e., corresponding to the
0 will grow when αβ < cκdξ, attenuate when αβ > cκdξ
positive signs) with α
and neither attenuate nor grow when αβ = cκdξ. Moreover, if

then γ = 0 and d = 0 by (54b). It follows from (56a) that under this condition, the phase velocity
of the wave will become independent of c and will depend only on the projection of u on κ. By
(46b) and (57), this peculiar situation arises for an observer rotating with a time independent
angular velocity when ξ = cκβ. For waves polarized at right angles to the wave vector (κ
D = 0),
this condition can be written as

·

ωo = 2f Ω, ωo = cκ,

f = cos θ1 cos θ2 sec θ3

(58)

where θ1, θ2, θ3 are respectively the direction angles of Ω in a righthanded cartesian coordinate
system formed by D, κ and κ
D. It should be noted that if d = 0 holds with exactitude, then
ts = 0 holds exactly by (56a), which means that the wave will attenuate completely before it has
a chance to travel a sensible distance. It follows that, in practice, one should expect d = 0 to hold
only approximately.

4 Gravitating Observers

We consider an observer in gravitational motion with acceleration

equations ([3], pg 152)

g =

u

h = p + qr/r

r

u = h

×

where p and h are independent of time and position. By taking the vector product of (60a) with
h and noticing that u

h = 0 by (60b), we get

from which we easily obtain

u = (p

h)/h2 + (qr

5 Applications

We have shown that for an observer in translational, rotational or gravitational motion, a linearly
polarized plane wave has two modes of propagation as summarized in Table 1. In the regular mode,
the phase and group velocities of the wave depend not only on wavelength and the observer’s
acceleration but also (via c as deﬁned by (5)) on the permittivity and the permeability of a
medium.
In the irregular or heretic mode, the phase and group velocities of the wave depend
only on wavelength and the observer’s motion but not on the permittivity or permeability of
the medium. A direct consequence of this circumstance is that phenomena (such as the Sagnac
eﬀect) which result in small measurable quantities due to the largeness of c can be made much
more accurate by using heretic waves instead of regular waves. Another consequence is that heretic
waves radiated with a given speed are observable only by an observer moving with the same speed,
hence they are well suited for selective broadcasting. They can be used, for example, to control
speed on a highway if a transmitter is installed on the highway and a receiver is installed in a car
because when (and only when) the car reaches the speed limit, the receiver will pick up the heretic
wave from the transmitter and take appropriate action. Inasmuch as for an observer moving with
a given velocity there exists not one heretic wave with a deﬁnite frequency and wavelength but
a complete spectrum of heretic waves with diﬀerent frequencies and wavelengths, all propagating
with the same speed as the observer, other uses of heretic waves based on their frequency and
wavelength are conceivable.

It is easy to see that a plane wave that is linearly polarized in its direction of propagation will
show hereticity relative to an observer in translational, rotational or gravitational motion. For if
D and κ are collinear, we have κ
= 0 in (17) for a translating observer, β = 0 in (46) for a

rotating observer, and ξ = κ in (76) for a gravitating observer. In the same way, it is easy to see
that if the wave is linearly polarized at right angles to its direction of propagation, it will behave
in a regular way. This implies that if the angle between the polarization and the propagation
direction is varied from π/2 to 0, the wave speed will vary from a value controlled by the material
constants of the medium to a value controlled by the motion of the observer. Hence if the observer
is at rest, the wave will eﬀectively be stopped from propagating. Propagation can be of course be
resumed by varying the polarization angle in the opposite direction; that is, from 0 to π/2.

×

We have shown that waves polarized at right angles to the wave vector can be heretic relative
a rotating observer if (58) is satisﬁed. This result provides an interesting explanation of the
apparently spurious signals observed in the experiment of Brillet and Hall [4]. To see this, suppose
that D and κ are on the horizontal plane so that κ
D is vertical. Equation (58) shows that
when the table used in the experiment is very nearly horizontal so that θ3 is close to 0, both
θ1 and θ2 approach π/2. Hence ωo approaches zero and no spurious signal should be observed.
As the rotation axis of the table deviates from the vertical in such a way that θ1 6
= π/2 and
= π/2, θ3 approaches π/2. Hence sec θ3 and ωo become increasingly large. This explains why
θ2 6
the experimenters were able to reduce the frequency of the spurious signal from 1KHZ to 17HZ by
increasingly aligning the rotation axis of the table vertically. Equation (58) also shows that for a
2Ω. This means that
given alignment of the rotation axis, the signal should have an amplitude
the signal should peak twice for each rotation of the table, as was observed in the experiment.
The larger observed signal of
200HZ may be attributed to interaction of the 17HZ signal with
the nonrotating beam used in the experiment. Thus, it appears that Brillet and Hall may have
unknowingly detected heretic waves. But the evidence is not as conclusive as one would like, and
the spurious signals may very well be due to other causes [5, 6].

≈

≈

Except for the situation described by (58), heretic modes of propagation arise mainly because
we have assumed a nonzero charge density in the region of interest (σ
= 0). As a result, they may
be less convenient than regular waves for some applications. One area where regular waves have
found common use in industry is in the detection of acceleration. Our analysis of regular waves
can be used to measure acceleration in three ways. First, one can use the equations for the phase
velocity to calculate the number N of fringes obtainable from the interference of regular waves.
Since this number depends on d which in turn depends on the component of the acceleration in
the direction of propagation via ϑ, this component of the acceleration can be calculated from
a measurement of N . Second, one can use the equations for the group velocity of a regular
wave to calculate the aberration ϕ of the wave. The aberration will be found to depend on d
so that the component of the acceleration in the propagation direction can be calculated from a
measurement of ϕ. Finally, one can measure the skin time ts directly and calculate the relevant
acceleration component from the dependence of ts on the component. To illustrate the ts method
for translation, we observe that to a second order approximation in ϑ, (22) gives

d2

1 = ϑ2/4

−

while from (24a), we have

and from (22), to all orders of accuracy,

d2

1 = (cκts)−2

−

ϑ = ak/(c2κ)
where ak is the component of the acceleration a parallel to κ. It follows from these equations that

ak =

2c
ts

which allows ak to be calculated from a measurement of ts. As is usually done in practice with
other methods, the components of a along three orthogonal directions can be measured by using
a system of three waves propagating in these directions.

For an observer in uniform translational motion, it appears that one should be able to use the
phase velocity in (24c) to calculate the number N of fringes involved in the interference of two
regular waves, and that, by measuring N and using its dependence on the observer’s speed, the
speed can be estimated. This is indeed correct. Unfortunately, as is well known, attempts to use
this technique with the Michelson-Morley interferometer have failed to date. This circumstance
is interpreted in special relativity as indicating the incorrectness of the phase velocity in (24c).
We are compelled to interprete the situation diﬀerently, however, because the phase velocity in
question follows unavoidably from our ﬁeld equations, and our ﬁeld equations have been shown to
be deductive consequences of conventions [1, 7], which means that they cannot be falsiﬁed by any
experiment consistent with those conventions ([8], pg 214). This problem will be treated in detail
elsewhere. We conclude with the remark that the results obtained in this paper have been shown
to be valid for linearly polarized plane waves and may not be applied to nonplane, unpolarized
or nonlinearly polarized waves without further analysis. They may also not be applied without
further analysis in a medium that is moving, anisotropic or inhomogeneous, or in a region of space
where the divergence theorem does not hold or charge conservation is violated. For a comparative
study of our treatment with others, we refer the reader to the works of Phipps [9], Klauber [10], Goy
and Selleri [11], Rizzi and Tartaglia [12], L¨ammerzahl and Haugan [13], Kopeikin and Sch¨afer [14],
and the references contained in these works.

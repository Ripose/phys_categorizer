On the Twin Non-paradox

A. F. Kraklauer and P. T. Kraklauer

It is shown that the (cid:16)twin paradox(cid:17) arises from omparing unlike entities, namely pereived

intervals with eigen intervals. When this launa is losed, it is seen that there is no twin paradox

and that eigen time an serve as the independent variable for mehanis in Speial Relativity.

Abstrat

1 Introdution

Informal remarks by editors of physis journals have it that by far the largest number of submissions

ritial of ontemporary physis attak Speial Relativity. Generally, these attaks all on the

impliit absurdity of the relativity of time and length spans; i.e., time-dilation and Fitzgerald

ontration. Among professional physiists, however, these onerns are most frequently written

o(cid:27) as the onservative stubbornness of amateurs unable to aommodate or omprehend the fore

of `modern' mathematial reasoning.

Nevertheless, there are fully serious and absolutely rigorous arguments supporting the amateur's

heretial tendenies in this matter. Consider the twin paradox, the ore of whih was atually (cid:28)rst

reognized by Einstein himself in the very (cid:28)rst artile ever written on speial relativity when

he pointed out that Lorentz transformations yield asymmetrial aging between various inertial

frames.[1℄ This feature was thereafter anthropomorphized by Longevin, who applied the priniple

of asymmetri aging to the now fabled example involving twins, one of whom makes a round trip

while the other stays put.[2℄ As is very well known, onventional analysis involving the Lorentz

transformations seems to show that the the traveling twin returns home to meet his sibling, now

muh older than himself.

In so far, however, as kinematially seen, both twins experiened a

symmetri relationship, the time di(cid:27)erene is paradoxial. Langevin resolved this paradox by

alling on the fat that the kinematial symmetry is broken by the dynamial fat that only the

traveler experiened aeleration. Almost immediately, however, von Laue observed that the e(cid:27)et

was independent of the aeleration, as the ageing e(cid:27)et ould be extended simply by extending the

length of the trip without altering the aelerations involved; that is, the dynamial aspets of the

trip must be irrelevant![3℄ It an not be both ways, however(cid:22)suh a on(cid:29)it an not be asribed to

an unsophistiate's failure to appreiate rigor. Ninety years, hundreds of books and thousands of

artiles later, despite exursions prompted by all manner of onsiderations, this matter still stands

at exatly at the point von Laue left it.

Of ourse, speial relativity has been veri(cid:28)ed by thousands of experiments; its fundamental

verity is unassailable. It is the purpose herein to propose a potential resolution for this on(cid:29)it

therefore, whih entails the minimum anillary modi(cid:28)ation to speial relativity.

2 Proper-length

Previous analysis of the twin paradox has not arefully onsidered the issue of the distane to the

turn-around point (herein for brevity alled the pylon ) of the traveling twin. This distane is not

a vetor on a Minkowski diagram, but in fat the spae-like separation of two entire whole world

lines, namely those of the terminus and of the pylon. The pylon, that is, its `plae' in the world,

is not an event but a loation. The turn-around itself is, of ourse, an event in the usual meaning

of that word for speial relativity. For the traveling twin, however, the turn-around event is a

seondary matter as far as his navigational needs are onerned. His primary onern is that he

1

should travel to the orret point in spae, regardless of the time, before reversing ourse. How

an he do this? In the most natural way, he and his stay-at-home sibling hart a ourse before

the beginning of the trip; they selet an ob jet in the world, a star say, and designate it as the

turn-around pylon. From standard referenes they know that this star is loated in a partiular

diretion at a determined distane D. This distane is not the length of a Lorentz vetor but the

proper-length of the displaement from the home loation of the twins. With this in hand, the

traveling twin then determines the speed apabilites of his raft and alulates the antiipated

arrival time at the pylon. This information is interesting but not vital, the traveler intends to

proeed to the pylon regardless of the time needed to arrive there.

The distane to the pylon star is not an apparent distane, the length of a moving rod, for

example, but the proper-length to the whole world line of the seleted star. Suh a length is a

salar and is not to be tranformed by a Lorentz transformation. The loation of the world line

of the pylon on a Minkowski diagram depends on the axis to whih it refers. That is, this world

line with respet to the stationary twin passes through the spae oordinate at `D' on the absissa.

Likewise, this world line must pass through the traveler's absissa also; but, beause of the di(cid:27)erene

in the sale of the traveler's axis, this same world line, although still parallel to the stay-at-home's

world line, will not be ongruent to the pylon's world line referred to the stay-at-home's axis, but is

displaed by the sale fator. (It is this displaement that has been overlooked in previous analysis

and whih distinguishes the approah taken herein.) The onsequene of this displaement is that,

the intersetion of the traveler's world line with the world line of the pylon is found to be further

out on the traveler's world line than usually thought; i.e., the proper time taken to reah the turn-

around is seen to be greater than heretofore alulated. In fat, it is equal to the proper time of the

stay-at-home as he himself omputes it for the time taken by the traveler to reah the turn-around

point. Thus, when the whole trip is ompleted, both twins agree that they have experiened equal

portions of proper time sine the start of the trip. Their reports to eah other via light signals on

the passage of time, in the usual way do not agree, however. But they are suh that the (cid:28)nal totals

at the end do agree.

These ideas are depited graphially in Figure 1.

3 Experimental on(cid:29)it

All standard works on Speial Relativity ite experiments attesting to the (cid:16)reality(cid:17) of time dilation

and the e(cid:27)et yielding the twin aging disrepany. How are they to be understood in view of the

above results? First, note that to date no experiment meets the onditions leading to the twin-

paradox. Certain experiments, those involving muon deays, for example, are desribed by linear

transformations but are not round trips. (cid:16)Cloks-around-the-world(cid:17) experiments did involve round

trips, but not linear (aeleration free) motion. Further, note that time dilation is `real' in the

sense that it atually ours with respet to signals. It is an e(cid:27)et attendant to `perspetive' in

spae-time. Thus, all physial e(cid:27)ets resulting from the `appearane' (i.e., the way in whih light

signals transmit information) will be modi(cid:28)ed by the the perspetive. So any test of time dilation

whih involves a report from or the interation between ob jets, will exhibit phenomena resulting

from relative positions of emitter and reeiver; i.e., perspetive.

Some experiments seem exempt from the e(cid:27)ets of perspetive. The two ustomary examples

are the muon deay urve in the atmosphere, and the transport of atomi `loks-around-the-world.'

Here the situation is less lear. Eah of these experiments, however, is a(cid:31)ited with features that

allow ontest.[4℄

Muon deay, for example, largely seems to ignore possible ross-setion dependene on the

veloity of the pro jetile and seondary prodution. The loks-around-the-world experiment has

been strongly ritiized for its data redution tehniques. Even the existene of time delay e(cid:27)ets

for transported loks has been questioned.[5℄ Without aess to the details of these experiments

and their subsequent data analysis, one is not in position to do deep ritial analysis; nevertheless,

there is su(cid:30)ient information in the literature to reasonably justify onsidering onlusions drawn

on their basis as disputable.

Figure 1: This (cid:28)gure is omprised of two Minkowski harts superimposed on eah other. The world

line of the Pylon in the (cid:28)xed frame passes through the point `D' on the x-axis. The orresponding

point on the x'-axis is found by sliding up the eigen length isoline to the intersetion with the

x'-axis. The world line of the pylon passes through this point on the prime hart. The intersetion

of the Pylon's world line with the t'-axis is the point on the traveler's hart representing the `turn-

around' event. The eigen time of the turn-around event in the (cid:28)xed frame is found by sliding

down that eigen time isoline whih passes through the turn-around event to its intersetion with

the t-axis. It is lear that this value is idential with the time assigned by the (cid:28)xed twin to the

turn-around event as it may be pro jeted horizontally over to the intersetion of the Pylon's world

line in the (cid:28)xed frame with the time axis of the traveler. The paradox arises by using, inorretly,

that eigen time isoline whih passes through the intersetion of the traveler's and the pylon's (cid:28)xed

frame worldlines.

On the other hand, there are also experimental results ompletely in aord with this result. An

attempt by Phipps to observe the so alled Ehrenfest e(cid:27)et(cid:22)Fitzgerald ontration of the irum-

ferene of a disk as a onsequene of high tangential veloity due to rotation(cid:22)gave unambiguous

null results, for example. [6℄

4 Conlusions

This note is not derived from an e(cid:27)ort to overthrow Speial Relativity, rather from an attempt to

use it. Its fundamental point is that omparisons must be made between like ob jets. Paradox

results from the omparison of pereived intervals as modi(cid:28)ed by spae-time perspetive with

Eigen intervals. Filling this launa in the understanding of Speial Relativity enables the resolution

of a large number of onundrums similar to the (cid:16)twin paradox.(cid:17)

The onlusions herein do not diminish the theory but atually extend its utility. The argu-

ments presented above obviously remain true when redued to in(cid:28)nitesimals, thereby enabling the

piee-wise omposition of an arbitrary (time-like) tra jetory in Minkowski spae. They provide a

substantiation of a resolution, proposed by one of us in the past, of a deep problem in (speial)

relativisti mehanis derived from the heretofore surmised lak of oordination among individual

eigen times for interating partiles.[7℄ The onsiderations in this note onstitute a didatial elab-

oration of that argument in whih it was observed that the di(cid:27)erential of ar length in Minkowski

spae is an invariant under Lorentz transformation. That is, the di(cid:27)erential of ar-length expressed

in the instantaneous rest frame along the orbit of the k-th partile at point p, is related to the

di(cid:27)erential of ar-length expressed in the instantaneous rest frame of the di(cid:27)erential of ar-length

at any loation p′

on that or any other ar j by a Lorentz transformation: L(p, p′, k, j):

dxk|p = L(p, p′, k, j)dxj|p′

It follows, that the ar-length is an invariant as:

(dxk|p · dxk|p)

1/2

= (dxj|p′ LT (p, p′, k, j) · L(p, p′, k, j)dxj |p)

1/2

= (dxj |p′ · dxj|p′ )

1/2.

(2)

This permits setting all suh di(cid:27)erential ar-lengths equal to a ommon expression:

whih an be rewritten as:

where γ has is ustomary meaning.

c dτ = (dxj · dxj )

1/2,

dτ = γ−1

j dtj ∀j,

The arguments in this note give a more intuitively understandable rendition of this fat by

showing that whenever two world lines reross, eigen intervals starting from the previous rerossing,

are equal, whih is a restatement of Eq. (4). The utility of this fat for a theory of mehanis in

Speial Relativity is exploited in Ref. ([7℄).

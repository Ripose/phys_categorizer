A charged space as the origin of sources, ﬁelds and
potentials

Abstract

The wave function ψ is interpreted as charge den-
sity, or charge distribution, at each point in space.
This is a physical interpretation of ψ. The notion of
speed can be associated with ψ, which leads to the
concept of conduction currents and (displacement)
convection currents. The charge distribution is the
origin of electrical and mechanical sources, poten-
tials and ﬁelds. The notion of self potential is es-
sential for deﬁning electrical or mechanical sources.
Maxwell’s equations are derived from the condi-
tion of charge conservation and mass conservation.
There are two methods of modelling the mass of a
charge:

1. The mass of a charge is its electrostatic energy.

2. The mass of a charge is the energy of the Zero
Point Field (ZPF) that interacts with the point
charge.

It is shown that the two models are related by a
simple energy equation for a particle at rest.

Introduction

An alternative study of microphysics [1], called Ma-
terial Wave Theory (MTW), shows that the inter-
pretation of ψ as a physical wave is more realis-
tic and more simple than the non-physical Copen-
hagen interpretation of ψ representing only statis-
tical qualities. The central conjecture of MTW is
the notion of intrinsic potential energy of a parti-
cle. This intrinsic potential energy turns out to be
electromagnetic ﬁeld energy. Therefore, the wave

nature of matter is closely related to electromag-
netic energy. There are several other theories that
attribute even more importance to electromagnetic
phenomena.

Stochastic Electro-dynamics (SED) [2]

[3] ex-
plains the statistical nature of micro-physics by a
physical mechanism: quantum-like ﬂuctuations of
a random perturbing Zero Point Field. The inertia
of a particle is described as a reaction force that is
a consequence of the anisotropy of the ZPF in an
accelerating frame of reference. This means that
inertia and also gravity are secondary electromag-
netic phenomena. The ZPF energy is described for
the ﬁrst time as an extra term in the Planck (or
blackbody) function.

In [4] the mass of a charge is considered equal
to the electrostatic energy of the charge. An ac-
celerating charge gives rise to a self force (New-
ton’s reaction force), because the speed of light is
anisotropic [5] around the accelerating charge. A
local anisotropy of light speed is exactly a ﬁeld of
gravity.

In [6] the linear momentum of a charged parti-
cle is described as a self induced magnetic potential
that acts on the charge, and also rest-mass is con-
sidered here as the electrostatic energy.

Although these views have much in common
(electrodynamics is essential in order to explain the
wave nature of matter, or to explain inertia and
gravity), it is not obvious how to integrate these
theories into one consistent theory. First, the elec-
trodynamics of electrons within MWT is further
explored.

2 Classical Electrodynamics

in MWT

Hofers central conjecture within MWT [1] is: the
intrinsic energy of a particle consists of kinetic and
potential energy. Quantum Physics states that the
intrinsic energy of a particle is solely kinetic. This is
not based on experiment, and the reasoning about
the intrinsic nature of particles within the frame-
work of Quantum Physics boils down to a logical
circle [1] :

If a particles intrinsic energy is solely kinetic,
the phase velocity of a de Broglie wave is not equal
to the mechanical velocity of a particle.
If phase
velocity does not equal mechanical velocity, a free
particle can not exist of a single wave of speciﬁc
frequency and it must be formalized as a Fourier
integral over inﬁnitely many partial waves. In this
case any partial wave can not be interpreted as a
physical wave. Then the wave features of a partial

internal processes remain unconsidered,

ψ. In this paper, C=1, and ψ has the dimension
of square root of mass-density. These deﬁnitions
deﬁne mechanical properties of ψ.

It is assumed that speed, ~u, can be associated
with ψ en ̺ :
~p = ̺~u is the impulse density and
wkin = 1
2 ̺u2
is the kinetic energy density (u =
~u
). A material wave is a periodic transformation

|
of intrinsic kinetic energy and intrinsic potential
energy, such that the sum of both intrinsic energy
densities is constant:

(2.3)

2.2 Electric and Magnetic Potentials

In Material Wave theory it is shown that the intrin-
sic potential is electromagnetic in nature. The def-
initions of the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld,
in terms of the intrinsic moment and intrinsic po-
tential, are as follows:

~E =

¯ρ

~B =

2 ¯ρ ∇ ×

~p

−

Hofers conjecture is more simple and forces to de-
scribe the wave nature of particles in terms of phys-
ical qualities, in stead of adopting the non-physical
Hilbert space.

where ¯ρ is a constant with the dimension of charge
density to guarantee compatibility with electro-

magnetic units. By substituting φ = φ0
and ~p = ̺~u, the equations 2.4 and 2.5 become:

First, the wave function ψ is treated as a real func-
tion, in stead of a complex function, and with phys-
ical meaning:

deﬁned as follows:

·
The function ̺ is the de Brogly wavefunction with
dimension of mass-density. A de Brogly wave is a
mass oscillation. The periodic change of kinetic en-
ergy requires the existence of an intrinsic potential
energy with a density of φ. The particle velocity
equals the phase velocity. By using an undeﬁned
constant C, it is avoided to deﬁne the dimension of

Equation 2.22 is Pointing’s Theorem in Material
Wave Theory. Notice that if ~g
~u = 0 then the ﬁeld
energies are zero, and also the energy ﬂow is zero.
The mass gradient of the matter wave must have
a non-zero component that is perpendicular to the
direction of motion. Otherwise there is no intrin-
sic potential energy. Therefore the monochromatic
plane particle wave (see equation 2.2) cannot be
an adequate description of a matter wave with in-
trinsic kinetic energy and intrinsic electro-magnetic

3 Self induced potentials

At this point it is worthwhile to make a compar-
ison with the notion of the self-induced magnetic
potential of a charge [6]:

This equation is the result of combining Newton’s
laws with Maxwell’s equations, as follows: an ap-
plied force causes an elementary particle, with mass
m and charge q, to accelerate.

meaning the total energy of a charge is electrostatic.
In equation 2.8, ¯ρ is a constant, which is not the
case in equation 3.1, where ρ is a scalar function. It
is not clear why ¯ρ is deﬁned a constant, except for
compatibility between units for mechanical quanti-
ties and variables for electromagnetical quantities.
The simplest view is to consider the self-induced
potentials and the intrinsic potentials of MWT as
equal, and to be called self potentials. This means
that we have to replace the constant ¯ρ for the scalar

3.1 The electromagnetic self poten-

Since ψ has real physical interpretation, the follow-
ing question comes to mind: is ρ a function of ψ?
If, for instance, ρ = ψ, then space is ﬁlled with
”charge”, or even consists of ”charge”. This model
is in agreement with notions like displacements cur-
rents or convection displacement currents [7]. Such
a current has to exist beside conduction currents
in order to solve a paradox in the Faraday-Maxwell
theory. The deﬁnitions of the electric and magnetic
potentials (in case

If ψ satisﬁes equations 3.11 and 3.12 at some point
in space, then ψ is a source at that particular point.
Equations 3.11 and 3.12 are called the self-potential
equations. They can be reformulated in terms of
the potentials:

w and ~p are the potential energy density and po-
tential momentum density. The vector ﬁelds ~f and
~s are the force density ﬁeld and angular momen-
tum density ﬁeld. An intrinsic angular momentum
is also called spin, and therefore the symbol s is
used. The constants ǫm and µm are the mechanical
analogies of ǫ and µ. The force density is zero if
energy-momentum is conserved.

In case ǫmµm = 1

u2 = constant then also for the

mechanical ﬁelds the Maxwell’s equations apply:

Equation 3.22 expresses that the spin increases or
decreases in case the rotation of force density is
not zero. Equation 3.23 is the law of gravity in
diﬀerential form. Equation 3.24 is the mechanical
equivalent of Amp`ere’s law.

Next, it is unnatural to distinguish between ̺s
and ̺ = ψ2 and therefore we can speak also of the
mechanical self potentials:

Its total energy density is ̺c2 = ρΦ. This can only
be understood by the notion of (intrinsic) self po-
tentials, as introduced in this paper. If the closed
and ﬁnite volume that conﬁnes the parton’s trajec-
tory is motionless, then one speaks of rest-energy
or rest-mass. This combines the diﬀerent models,
as described in the introduction, such that it yields
one theory.

The charged ﬁeld ψ does not show Coulomb in-
teraction or gravity interaction between every two
points. In other words: not all points in space are
sources. Only those points in space that satisfy the
self potential equations can show Coulomb interac-
tion or gravity interaction. Thus, the charged space
ψ is the origin of sources and (self) potentials.

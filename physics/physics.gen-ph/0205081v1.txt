Abstract—A theoretical analysis of the excitation of an inﬁnitely long
solenoid by oscillating current has revealed the existence of speciﬁc poten-
tials in the space outside the solenoid, which can aﬀect electron diﬀraction
in an experiment similar to the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect. Thus, these time-
dependent potentials are physical ﬁelds possessing a number of speciﬁc fea-
tures, which set them oﬀ from the ﬁelds known heretofore.

PACS 03.50D, 12.20, 41.20, 72.15R.
The peculiar phenomenon, predicted in 1939 and 1949 [1, 2] and rediscov-
ered and studied theoretically in considerable detail in 1959 [3], was subse-
quently called the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) eﬀect. It consists essentially in that
in propagating through a region with no magnetic or electric ﬁeld present,
but where the vector or scalar potential is nonzero, the de Broglie wave cor-
responding to a quantum charged particle is acted upon by the latter. These
conditions are best realized in a static regime, which was exactly the case
studied before the 1990s. While a long discussion has certainly contributed
to a proper understanding of the AB eﬀect (see, e.g., reviews [4]), heated
debates on this issue are still continuing in the literature. Most clear and
sequentially theory of eﬀect AB enunciated in paper of prof. D. H. Kobe [5].
Based on the totality of the experiments performed, one has to admit that
the AB eﬀect can exist only if there are potentials, which do not generate
ﬁelds and cannot be removed by gauge transformation. We have termed them
“zero-ﬁeld potentials”. Note that zero-ﬁeld potentials, which transform only

1

the phase of a wave function, are responsible for the AB eﬀect in all the
papers published heretofore and dealing with the static case. In a general
case, such potentials satisfy the relations

− c−1∂A0/∂t − grad ϕ0 = 0 and rot A0 = 0, (1)

where the upper indices of the potentials refer to the zero-ﬁeld potentials.
Because such potentials should obviously have the form

A0 = grad χ ϕ0 = −

1
c

,

(1)

the χ function was erroneously identiﬁed in practically all publications with
the gradient potential transformation function, and this is what gives rise
frequently to misunderstanding.

After the convincing experiments of Tonomura et al.

[6], the possibili-
ties of studying the static AB eﬀect at the present level of technology were
apparently exhausted, and the researchers turned their attention to the in-
vestigation of the time-dependent, or quasi-AB eﬀect [7]. However, in this
work, which has certainly produced fruitful results, the potentials responsi-
ble for the quasi-AB eﬀect were introduced artiﬁcially, without discussing in
any way their nature. Nevertheless, the origin of these potentials (ﬁelds) is
a major issue in the separation of the AB eﬀect from the general variation
of the de Broglie wave-interference pattern due to Lorenz force.

We maintain that in the regions of space with no currents present the

total potentials can be presented, generally speaking, in the form

A = Af + A0 and ϕ = ϕf + ϕ0, (3)

where index f refers to “ﬁeld” potentials corresponding to nonzero electro-
magnetic ﬁelds:

E = − c−1∂Af /∂t − grad ϕf , B = rot Af .

(2)

Index 0 in Eq.

(3) identiﬁes zero-ﬁeld or excess potentials deﬁned by
relations (1). Note that the “excess” potentials have been long in use in
mathematical physics [8]; they are necessary when solving Maxwell’s equa-
tions with boundary conditions.

We are going to demonstrate the above in a speciﬁc example. Consider
circular currents ﬂowing in a region of space to form an inﬁnitely long cylinder
of radius R (a solenoid with circular currents). Choose a cylindrical reference
frame (ρ, α, z) with the axis z coinciding with the solenoid axis.
In the
magnetostatic case, the solution within the inﬁnite solenoid ( 0 ≤ ρ < R)

2

1 = A 1α, A0

can be chosen in the form A 1α = c1 ρ ( Af
1 = 0). In the outer
region ( ρ > R), the solution has the form A 2α = c2 / ρ + c3 ρ. The system
being inﬁnite, one cannot require the potential to vanish at large distances.
As is clear from purely physical considerations, the magnetic ﬁeld outside the
solenoid is zero, i.e., Af
2 = 0. Therefore, the only potential that can exist in
the outer region is A0, which satisﬁes the additional condition rot A0 = 0,
and it is this condition that identiﬁes the correct solution A 2α = c2 / ρ .
The potential in the outer region is essentially the zero-ﬁeld potential, so that
A2 = grad χ, but because this region is doubly connected, the χ function
6= 0, despite the fact that in this region (R <
is multivalued, and
L
ρ < ∞) rot A2 ≡ 0.

The above separation of the potentials into the ﬁeld and zero-ﬁeld ones
permits one to ﬁnd the zero-ﬁeld potentials for a time-dependent current as
well. As before, we assume that circular currents ﬂow in a region of space to
form an inﬁnitely long cylinder. The reference frame will be left unchanged.
The current can be described by the following relations

jα (ρ, α, z) = I0 δ (ρ − R) exp i ωt , jρ = jz = 0, (5)

where R is the solenoid radius, ω is the cyclic frequency of the current, and
I0 = J / 2πR; here J is the current in the cylinder wall per unit length of
the solenoid.

The nonzero vector-potential components Aρ and Aαcan be written [9]

Aρ =

jα (ρ′) sin (α − α′) G (ρ, ρ′) dV ′,

Aα =

jα (ρ′) cos (α − α′) G (ρ, ρ′) dV ′,

In the static case (ω → 0), one obtains from these relations the well-

known expressions

As seen from Eq. (9), the curl of the ﬁrst term in braces is zero. One
can readily verify that the curls of the other terms in the braces are nonzero.
Thus, in this case the total potential can be separated into the ﬁeld and the

Consider now the geometry of the Aharonov-Bohm experiment, in which
electrons move around a solenoid along a circle of a given radius. We shall
limit ourselves to the case where the electrons meet on their way nonzero
zero-ﬁeld potentials, while ﬁeld potentials are not present. This situation
can be realized by enclosing the solenoid in cylindrical screens, or, as follows
from Eq.
(11a), by choosing the trajectory radii of the electrons and by
mathching properly their transit with the current variation in the solenoid.
Substituting now the zero-ﬁeld potentials in the Schrodinger equation and

4

using the procedure of the solution proposed in (Appendices B and D in [7])
but, in contrast to [7], performing time averaging, we come to the following
expression for the intensity of the interference pattern [11]

P = 0.5 P0 {1 + J0 (S) · cos [ωe τ ]},

(6)
where S = 16 π3 I0 R µ−1
0 ω−1 J1 (k R), µ 0 = ch/|e| and J0 and J1 are the
Bessel functions. For I0 = 158 mA/cm ; R = 5 µm ; ω/2π < 1010Hz,
we obtain S = 2.45. This means that the interference pattern should vanish
for these parameters. To verify experimentally this conclusion, one should
use preferably electrons in metallic mesoscopic rings or cylinders [4]

Thus, we believe that the Aharonov-Bohm experiment in both the static
and the time-dependent case is actually an experiment on detection of a
ﬁeld of a new type in classical electrodynamics. This ﬁeld has none of the
characteristics inherent in the classical electromagnetic ﬁelds, namely, the
energy, the momentum, and the angular momentum. Therefore, these ﬁelds
have a high penetration capacity and can be used for information transfer,
with its detection by the AB eﬀect.

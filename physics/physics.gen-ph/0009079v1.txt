Relativistic Quantum Physics with Hyperbolic Numbers

S. Ulrych

Bombachsteig 16, CH-8049 Z¨urich, Switzerland

Summary. — The hyperbolic number system is rarely used though it is a helpful
tool for the description of relativistic physics. It allows a rewriting of the quadratic
Dirac equation in terms of a 2 × 2-matrix equation.
In addition, the relativistic
description of spin and orbital angular momentum is simpliﬁed with the hyperbolic
number system. Beside of other applications this new developed formalism can be
used for the solution of relativistic single particle equations with non-static poten-
tials.

PACS 12.20.-m – 03.65.Pm, 11.15.-q, 32.30.-r.

1. – Introduction

The present work wants to show basic concepts for the application of hyperbolic
numbers in relativistic quantum physics. The hyperbolic number system has a long
history [1, 2], but is rarely used in physics.

In analogy to the complex numbers, which provide a relationship between the sine, the
cosine and the exponential function, the hyperbolic numbers give a relationship between
the hyperbolic sine, the hyperbolic cosine and the exponential function. Therefore they
are a good tool for the representation of relativistic coordinate transformations and
considerations of the spin and the orbital angular momentum within the Lorentz group.
The quadratic Dirac equation can be rewritten, using the hyperbolic numbers, in terms
of a 2 × 2-matrix equation, which has the consequence that also relativistic spinors for
massive particles are represented as two component spinors. The quadratic Dirac equa-
tion, understood as a single particle particle equation, is the starting point of calculations
with non-static potentials.

2. – Hyperbolic numbers

In the present investigation hyperbolic numbers are used for the mathematical for-
mulation of the electron wave equation. Since these numbers are rarely used in physical
applications a brief introduction of the number system is given.

The hyperbolic numbers x ∈ H are deﬁned as

x = x0 + jx1 ,

x0, x1 ∈ R ,

S. ULRYCH

where the hyperbolic unit j has the property

(2)

j2 = 1 .

This leads to the following rules for the multiplication and addition of two hyperbolic
numbers x = x0 + jx1 and y = y0 + jy1

(3)

x + y = (x0 + y0) + j(x1 + y1) ,

xy = (x0y0 + x1y1) + j(x0y1 + x1y0) .

Since there are non-zero elements which have no inverse element these numbers form a
commutative ring. The hyperbolic unit j provides a relation between the hyperbolic sine,
cosine and the exponential function

(4)

cosh φ + j sinh φ = ejφ ,

which can be derived in the same way as the corresponding relation for the complex
numbers.

In addition to the complex conjugation, a hyperbolic conjugation will be used in the

following which changes only the sign of the hyperbolic unit

(5)

x− = x0 − jx1 .

3. – Relativistic vectors and the spin group

3

.
1. Relativistic vectors. – With respect to the investigation of the spin angular mo-
mentum in one of the following chapters a new relativistic algebra is introduced, which
can not be expressed in terms of the Dirac or the quaternion algebra. A contravariant
Lorentz vector with the coordinates xµ = (x0, xi) is represented as

(6)

X = xµσµ .

In contrast to the quaternion formalism, the basis vectors σµ are made up of the unity
and the elements of the Pauli algebra multiplicated by the hyperbolic unit j

(7)

σµ = (1, jσi) .

Separating time and space coordinates one therefore ﬁnds

(8)

X = x0 + jx · σ .

The Pauli algebra is characterized by its multiplication rules, which can be written as

(9)

σiσj = δij1 + iǫijkσk .

RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM PHYSICS WITH HYPERBOLIC NUMBERS

Using the Pauli matrices as the explicit representation of σi, the vector X can be ex-
pressed in terms of a 2 × 2 matrix according to

(10)

X = (cid:18) x0 + jx3

jx1 + ijx2

jx1 − ijx2

x0 − jx3 (cid:19) .

A scalar product between two vectors can be deﬁned using the trace of the matrix

¯XY

(11)

h X | Y i =

1
2

T r ( ¯XY ) .

The symbol ¯X = X † − denotes transposition, complex and hyperbolic conjugation of the
matrix. ¯XY corresponds to a matrix multiplication of the two 2 × 2 matrices ¯X and
Y . As stated above, the Pauli matrices can be considered as the basis vectors of the
relativistic vector space σµ ≡ eµ. These basis vectors form a non-cartesian orthogonal
basis with respect to the scalar product deﬁned in Eq. (11)

(12)

h eµ | eν i = gµν ,

where the metric tensor gµν is the diagonal 4 × 4 matrix with the matrix elements

(13)

gµν =

As an example the energy-momentum vector of a free classical pointlike particle,
moving with the velocity v relative to the observer, is expressed in terms of the matrix
algebra. The relativistic momentum vector for this particle can be written as

(14)

P =

E
c

+ jp · σ = mc exp (jξ · σ) ,

with c denoting the velocity of light, ξ the rapidity, E the energy and p the momentum
of the particle. The rapidity is deﬁned as

(15)

tanhξ =

v
c

=

pc
E

,

where ξ = |ξ| and p = |p|. Rapidity and momentum point into the same direction
n = v/|v| as the velocity.

In quantum mechanics energy and momentum are substituted by diﬀerential opera-

tors. With ∇ = ∂µσµ the momentum operator is then given by

(16)

P = i¯h∇ .

This operator forms the basis of the wave equation with spin, which will be introduced
in Section 4. In the following c and ¯h will be set equal to one.

2. Lorentz Transformations. – In analogy to the relation between SU (2) and SO(3)
the transformation properties of the vectors deﬁned in the last subsection give a relation
between SO(3, 1) and a spin group deﬁned as an extension of the unitary group SU (2).
In the following rotations and boosts will be investigated. The rotation of a vector has
the form

(17)

X =⇒ X ′ = RX R† ,
R = exp (−iθ · σ/2) ,

where X = xµσµ. In addition, a vector can be boosted to a diﬀerent system. The boost
parameters ξ are chosen to make the considered vector describe an object moving into
the positive direction for positive values of ξ.
In many investigations a diﬀerent sign
convention is used. For the boosts one ﬁnds the transformation rule

(18)

X =⇒ X ′ = BXB† ,
B = exp (jξ · σ/2) .

The dagger in the above equations includes only a hermitian conjugation and not a
hyperbolic conjugation. For the boost transformation one ﬁnds the relation B† = B,
whereas the inverse of the boost operator corresponds to B−1 = ¯B. The explicit matrix
representations of the boost matrices B are

(19)

B1 = (cid:18) cosh ξ1/2

j sinh ξ1/2

j sinh ξ1/2

cosh ξ1/2 (cid:19)

for a boost in the direction of the x-axis and

(20)

B2 = (cid:18) cosh ξ2/2

ij sinh ξ2/2

−ij sinh ξ2/2

cosh ξ2/2

(cid:19) ,

B3 = (cid:18) ejξ3/2

0

0

e−jξ3/2 (cid:19)

for boosts along the y- and the z-axis.

To proof that these transformation matrices are a representation of the Lorentz group

the corresponding Lie algebra has to be investigated.

If boosts and rotations are combined as follows

(21)

X =⇒ X ′ = LXL† ,
L = exp (−i(J · θ + K · ξ)) ,

the inﬁnitesimal generators of these transformations can be identiﬁed with

(22)

Ji =

σi
2

,

Ki = ij

σi
2

.

With the commutation relations of the Pauli matrices one can derive that the generators
satisfy the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group SO(3, 1)

(23)

[ Ji , Jj ] = iεijkJ k ,
[Ki, Jj ] = iεijkK k ,
[Ki, Kj] = −iεijkJ k .

RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM PHYSICS WITH HYPERBOLIC NUMBERS

5

Therefore, the matrices R and B given in Eqs. (17) and (18) can be identiﬁed as the
transformation matrices of the spin group of SO(3, 1).

Alternatively, the Lorentz transformations can be expressed with relativistic second
2 representation given in Eq. (22) the

rank tensors. Using the generators of the spin s = 1
relativistic tensor of the spin angular momentum operator is

(24)

Sij = ǫijkJ k ,

S0i = −Si0 = Ki

and the Lorentz transformations given in Eq. (21) can be formulated according to

(25)

L = exp (−

i
2

Sµνωµν ) .

The boost parameters ωµν are ωij = ǫijkθk and ωi0 = ξi.

4. – The fermion wave equation

In the present work a relativistic wave equation is used, which is closely related to the
classical wave equation. The diﬀerential operator of this wave equation is formed by the
momentum operator P multiplied by the dual operator ¯P .

(26)

P ¯P ψ(x) = m2ψ(x) ,

where P = i∇. The diﬀerential operator P ¯P can be replaced by P P − since the mo-
mentum operator is hermitian. In the following investigations there are no diﬀerences
between these two choices even if interactions are introduced. The wave function ψ(x)
has the general structure

(27)

ψ(x) = ϕ(x) + jχ(x) ,

where ϕ(x) and χ(x) are two-component spinor functions. They depend on the four
space-time coordinates xµ. The transformation properties of the operator ¯P can be
deduced by a hermitian and hyperbolic conjugation of the corresponding equations given
in the last section.

In order to clarify the structure of the equation above, some explicit details are given.

The Pauli matrices in Eq. (26) can be seen if one inserts Def. (6)

(28)

σµ ¯σνP µP νψ(x) = m2ψ(x) .

The tensor σµ ¯σν represents the spin structure which is acting on the spinor function.
The explicit form is obtained by a matrix multiplication of the 2 × 2 basis matrices. The
tensor can be separated into a symmetric and an antisymmetric contribution

(29)

σµ ¯σν = gµν − iσµν ,

where gµν corresponds to the metric tensor and the antisymmetric part is given by

(30)

σµν =




−ijσ1

−σ1

−ijσ3
−σ2
σ1

.




6

S. ULRYCH

The antisymmetric contribution σµν is directly related to the relativistic generalisation
of the spin angular momentum operator. Using the generators of the spin s = 1
2 repre-
sentation given in Eq. (24) one ﬁnds

(31)

Sµν =

σµν
2

.

Since P µP ν is symmetric and σµν = −σνµ the operator P ¯P is equivalent to P ¯P = PµP µ.
At this point the particular form of the diﬀerential operator seems to be without
any eﬀect. However, the spin information which is included in the diﬀerential operator
becomes essential if the momentum operators are replaced by covariant derivates. The
inﬂuence of this spin structure can be illustrated by the following example.

Coordinate and momentum vector satisfy the relation

(32)

X ¯P = XµP µ − iSµνLµν ,

where Lµν = X µP ν − X νP µ corresponds to the relativistic orbital angular momentum.

5. – Plane wave states

In this section the solutions of the wave equation will be studied in the free non-
interacting case. Due to the simpliﬁcation of the diﬀerential operator P ¯P = PµP µ, which
is identical with the mass operator of the Poincar´e group, the solutions will be expressed
in terms of the corresponding plane wave representations. The section is separated into
two parts. The ﬁrst part describes how the plane wave states are generated with the
induced representation method. The second section investigates the connection between
spin and Pauli-Lubanski vector.

5

.
1. Induced representation method . – The irreducible representations of the Poin-
In the present work these
car´e group are labelled by the mass m and the spin s [3].
states will be generated with the induced representation method, where a state vector
is deﬁned within the little group of the Poincar´e group, i.e. the subgroup that leaves
a particular standard vector invariant. An arbitrary state is then generated with the
.
remaining transformations. In the following the transformation rules of Section 3
2 will
be applied.

For massive fermions one can choose the standard vector pµ

t = (m, 0, 0, 0). The little
group of this standard vector is SO(3). The explicit representation of the spin s = 1
2
states is given by the Pauli spinor, which will be denoted by | σt i = χσ. The polarisation
is chosen along the z-axis. For the description of the mass quantum number m the ket
| pµ

t i is introduced.
One therefore starts with the following state

(33)

| pµ

t i ⊗ | σt i = | pµ

t σt i .

Now, the boosts are acting on this state according to

(34)

D(B)| pµ

t σt i = | pµ i Bχσ ,

where B has been deﬁned in Eq. (18) and pµ = (B)µ
ν can be derived from
Eq. (63). Since the boost transforms from the rest frame to a particular frame, in which

t . (B)µ

νpν

RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM PHYSICS WITH HYPERBOLIC NUMBERS

the state is described by the momentum pµ, the boost parameters can be identiﬁed with
the rapidity. With this information it is possible to calculate the explicit form of the
relativistic spinor. In analogy to the Dirac formalism one can introduce the notation

(35)

u(p, σ) = Bχσ .

Explicitly the boost matrix can be written as

(36)

B = exp (jξ · σ/2) = cosh ξ/2 + j n · σ sinh ξ/2 ,

where the rapidity ξ satisﬁes the following relations

(37)

cosh ξ/2 = (cid:18) p0 + m

2m (cid:19)1/2

,

sinh ξ/2 = (cid:18) p0 − m

2m (cid:19)1/2

.

Inserting these results into Eq. (35) the spinor is given by

(38)

u(p, σ) = r p0 + m

2m (cid:18)1 +

jp · σ

p0 + m(cid:19) χσ .

The antiparticle spinor is constructed in analogy to the Dirac theory, where upper and
lower components are interchanged compared to the particle spinor. In the formalism
presented here, this can be achieved by multiplying the particle spinor by the hyperbolic
unit j, i.e. v(p, σ) = ju(p, σ). Therefore, one can write

(39)

v(p, σ) = r p0 + m

2m (cid:18) p · σ

p0 + m

+ j(cid:19) χσ .

.
2. The Pauli-Lubanski vector and spin operators. – To show that the plane wave
states, derived in the last part of this section, correspond to an irreducible representation
of the Poincar´e group, the connection of these states with the second Casimir operator,
the Pauli-Lubanski vector, will be investigated. Since the spin s = 1
2 representation
is considered, the spin angular momentum operators of Eq. (24) will be used for the
deﬁnition of the Pauli-Lubanski vector

(40)

W µ =

1
2

ǫµρσν SρσPν = ˜Sµν Pν ,

where ˜Sµν is the dual tensor of the relativistic angular momentum tensor. Explicitly the
Pauli-Lubanski vector has the form

(41)

W 0 = −J · P ,

W = −J P 0 − K × P

With the Pauli-Lubanski vector the relativistic spin operators can be deﬁned, where
the investigation follows the methods given in [4, 5]. One chooses a set of four orthogonal
vectors n(ν) satisfying the relation

(42)

n(µ)
ρ nρ(ν) = gµν .

8

S. ULRYCH

Using these vectors the spin operators are deﬁned according to

(43)

S =

1
m

Wµ nµ ,

where nµ = nµ(i).
If the plane wave states derived in the ﬁrst part of this section
shall be eigenstates of the spin operators, a particular set of orthogonal vectors nµ(ν) =
(n0(ν), nk(ν)) has to be introduced

(44)

nµ(0) = (cid:18) P 0

m

,

P k

m (cid:19) ,

nµ(i) = (cid:18) P i

m

, δki +

P kP i

m(P 0 + m) (cid:19) .

Using these vectors the three spin operators can be written explicitly as

(45)

S =

1

m (cid:18)J P 0 + K × P − (J · P )

P

P 0 + m(cid:19) .

For the spin operators one ﬁnds S2 = s(s + 1) = −WµW µ/m2. The operators satisfy
the commutation relations of the little group SO(3). The third component of the spin
vector can be used to characterize the polarisation.

The spin operators were constructed in that way, that they coincide with a vector of

boosted generators J , where the boost matrices are acting on the coordinates

(46)

S = BJ ¯B .

In other words, S refers to the same operator as J . As well as in the derivation of
the plane wave states, the boost parameters in B have to be identiﬁed with the rapid-
ity of the state vector. From the above equation follows that under arbitrary Lorentz
transformations the spin operators have to transform according to

(47)

S =⇒ S′ = LS ¯L ,

where L corresponds to the Lorentz tranformation matrix given in Eq. (21). From
Eq. (46) one can deduce that it is suﬃcient to deﬁne the spin in the rest frame of the
state, according to the non-relativistic description with the non-relativistic spin operators
Ji = σi/2, whereas the boost operators Ki = ijJi are not used to characterize the single-
particle state for positive energies.

Vector products of the form A ¯B, with two arbitrary vectors A and B, transform in

the same way as the spin operators

(48)

(A ¯B) =⇒ (A ¯B)′ = L(A ¯B) ¯L .

Therefore, P ¯P was chosen as the diﬀerential operator of the wave equation with spin.
This guarantees that the operator shows the correct transformation property.

Now, the properties of the positive energy states can be summarized. The plane wave

states for positive energies are eigenstates of the four operators

RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM PHYSICS WITH HYPERBOLIC NUMBERS

{PµP µ, P µ, WµW µ, S3} and satisfy the relations

PµP µ | pµ σ i = m2 | pµ σ i ,
P µ | pµ σ i = pµ | pµ σ i ,

(49)

WµW µ | pµ σ i = −m2s(s + 1) | pµ σ i ,

S3 | pµ σ i = σ | pµ σ i .

With these states and the contributions from the negative energies the solution of the
wave equation ψ(x) can be expressed as the following plane wave expansion

(50)

ψ(x) = Xσ Z

d3p

(2π)32p0 (cid:16)u(p, σ)e−ipµxµ

b(p, σ) + v(p, σ)eipµxµ ¯d(p, σ)(cid:17) .

6. – Wave equation and Dirac equation

The fermion wave equation should be invariant under local gauge transformations.
This has the consequence that a gauge ﬁeld has to be introduced by a substitution of
the momentum operators.

In the following only electromagnetic interactions are considered. The gauge ﬁeld is

then introduced with the minimal substitution of the momentum operators

(51)

P µ =⇒ P µ − eAµ(x) ,

where the charge e < 0 corresponds to the negative charge of the electron. Using the
above substitution the electron wave equation transforms into

(52)

(P − eA(x))( ¯P − e ¯A(x)) ψ(x) = m2 ψ(x) .

Remember that A(x) = A0(x) + jA(x) · σ and ¯A(x) = A0(x) − jA(x) · σ.

The Dirac equation is able to explain experimental data with highest accuracy. The
electron wave equation should therefore be in agreement with the Dirac equation. One
can show that the wave equation is equivalent to the quadratic form of the Dirac equation
from which one knows that the energy spectrum of hydrogen like systems is exactly the
same as for the Dirac equation.

To show this relationship, the wave equation (52) will be considered in detail. A short

calculation is leading to

(53)

(cid:0)(P 0 − eA0)2 − ((P − eA) · σ)2 − j[P 0 − eA0, P − eA] · σ − m2(cid:1) ψ(x) = 0 .

One can evaluate the second term of the equation according to

(54)

((P − eA) · σ)2 = (P − eA) · (P − eA) − e B · σ ,

where B corresponds to the magnetic ﬁeld. The commutator can be calculated according
to

(55)

[P 0 − eA0, P − eA] = ieE ,

10

S. ULRYCH

with the electric ﬁeld E. Inserting these results into Eq. (53) gives

(56)

(cid:0)(P − eA)µ(P − eA)µ − e ijE · σ + eB · σ − m2(cid:1) ψ(x) = 0 .

It is possible to express Eq. (56) completely in the relativistic tensor formalism if Pauli
matrices and electromagnetic ﬁelds are expressed with the antisymmetric tensor σµν
given in Eq. (30) and F µν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ

(57)

(cid:16)(P − eA)µ(P − eA)µ −

e
2

σµν F µν − m2(cid:17) ψ(x) = 0 .

This equation is formal identical to the quadratic form of the Dirac equation, which

can be derived from the Dirac formalism. The Dirac equation is given by

(58)

(γµP µ − eγµAµ(x) − m)ψ(x) = 0

with the Dirac matrices γµ. The quadratic form can be found if one multiplies the Dirac
equation by the operator γµP µ − eγµAµ(x) + m. This yields

(cid:0)(γµP µ− eγµAµ)2 − m2(cid:1) ψ(x)

= (cid:18)(P − eA)µ(P − eA)µ −
= (cid:16)(P − eA)µ(P − eA)µ −

e
2

σµν [P µ − eAµ, P ν − eAν ] − m2(cid:19) ψ(x)
σµν F µν − m2(cid:17) ψ(x) = 0 .

The two wave equations (57) and (59) have the same form. However, there are two
diﬀerences: The ﬁrst diﬀerence is given in the structure of the spinors ψ(x). In the case
of the wave equation ψ(x) has a two-component structure, whereas in the Dirac equation
ψ(x) corresponds to a four-component spinor

Wave equation :

ψ(x) = ϕ(x) + jχ(x) ,

(60)

Dirac equation :

ψ(x) = (cid:18) ϕ(x)

χ(x) (cid:19) .

The other diﬀerence is the spin tensor σµν .
In the Dirac theory this term is deﬁned
according to σµν = i/2 [γµ, γν ]. With this tensor one is able to express Eq. (59) according
to

(61)

(cid:0)(P − eA)µ(P − eA)µ − e iE · α + eB · σ − m2(cid:1) ψ(x) = 0 .

Comparing this equation with Eq. (56) one observes that in both cases the term
including the electric ﬁeld is the only term which couples the upper and the lower com-
ponent of the spinor. In the wave equation the coupling term is proportional to jσ, in
the quadratic Dirac equation the term corresponds to α = γ0γ = γ5σ. One can show,
using the Dirac representation of γ5, that j and γ5 have the same eﬀect on the spinor,
an interchange between upper and lower components

Wave equation :

j ψ(x ) = χ(x) + jϕ(x) ,

(62)

Dirac equation :

γ5ψ(x) = (cid:18) 0

χ(x) (cid:19) = (cid:18) χ(x)

One therefore ﬁnds in both cases the same two coupled diﬀerential equations. In the
wave equation the terms proportional to the hyperbolic unit belong to one diﬀerential
equation, the other terms to the second equation. In the quadratic Dirac equation the
diﬀerential equations are separated by the component structure.

7. – Orbital angular momentum and single particle potentials

As well as in the description of the relativistic spin, the hyperbolic numbers provide
a simpliﬁed description of the orbital angular momentum. The transformation of the
vector components xµ can be performed with 4 × 4 transformation matrices

(63)

xµ =⇒ xµ′ = (L)µ

In the following Eq. (56) will be considered, where Aµ(x) is interpretated as a single
particle potential. The relative coordinates xµ can be restricted to spacelike coordinates,
i.e. xµxµ = −ρ2 < 0. The parametrisation of the free space coordinates suitable for the
description of a single particle moving in a relativistic potential is then




The relative time between the particles is parametrized as ρ sinh ξ, where ρ > 0. In the
limit of ξ → 0 the vector reduces to a non-relativistic vector in spherical coordinates.

Using the representation of the Lorentz transformations given in Eq. (63) the above
t = (0, 0, 0, 1) with the following trans-

vector can be obtained from a standard vector xµ
formation

(66)

L(θ, φ, ξ) = exp (−iJ3 φ ) exp (−iJ2 θ ) exp (−iK3 ξ ) .

Now, one can adopt the results of the considerations of the spin angular momentum.
Changing from the matrix representation given above to the irreducible group represen-
tation one can write

(67)

K = ijJ

and the transformation of Eq. (66) can be written as

(68)

L(θ, φ, ξ) = exp (−iJ3 φ ) exp (−iJ2 θ ) exp (jJ3 ξ ) .

As stated in Section 5

following relations for the irreducible states

L2 | l m i = l(l + 1) | l m i ,
L3 | l m i = m | l m i .

Now the transformation given above can be represented explicitly in matrix form accord-
ing to

with

mr = h l ml | e−iL2 θ | l mr i .

The only diﬀerence of the relativistic rotation matrices compared to the nonrelativistic
rotation matrices is absorbed in the phase ejmr ξ . Since these rotation matrices are
related to the spherical harmonics, it is possible to deﬁne relativistic spherical harmonics
according to

(72)

Ylmlmr (Ω) = (cid:18) 2l + 1

4πf (Λ)(cid:19)1/2

[Dl(θ, φ, ξ)ml

mr ]∗− ,

where Ω ≡ (θ, φ, ξ). The normalisation is a function of the cut-oﬀ parameter Λ. To deﬁne
a compact group the parameter space of ξ ∈ [−Λ, Λ] is restricted. The limit Λ → ∞ can
be taken at the end of explicit calculations, if this is needed. The additional magnetic
quantum number mr reﬂects the fact that, compared to non-relativistic physics, there is
the additional free parameter ξ. The above description implies a range of mr between l
and −l with integer steps.

With the relativistic spherical harmonics the dependence of the PµP µ = −∂µ∂µ term
in Eq. (56) on the rotation and boost parameters θ, φ, and ξ can be eliminated and
absorbed in the dependence on the angular momentum l and the seperation constants
ml and mr.

It is non-trivial task to derive relativistic single particle potentials from ﬁrst principles.
However, one can perform calculations with appropriate model potentials. One possibility
would be a relativistic generalisation of the 1/|x| central potential describing an electron
moving in the potential of a nucleus.

RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM PHYSICS WITH HYPERBOLIC NUMBERS

In the static limit ξ → 0 this potential reduces to the 1/|x| potential.

Equation (56) has not been solved yet with the above potential. Therefore, only some
general remarks on the solution procedure are given here. The σ-terms in Eq. (56) imply
a coupling of the orbital angular momentum with the spin Jc = L+ S. In addition, there
is a term proportional to the hyperbolic unit j which has a diﬀerent parity. To obtain a
solution the general ansatz for the wave function ψ(x) must be

(75)

with

ψ(x) = φl(x) + jχl′ (x) ,

l′ = (cid:26) l − 1

l + 1

for

l = jc + 1/2
l = jc − 1/2

.

A relativistic single particle potential depends on the relative time. Therefore, one
can not ask for the energy spectrum. The spectrum to be considered here is the mass
spectrum. One can introduce a mass operator

(77)

M 2 = (P − eA(x))µ(P − eA(x))µ −

where the solutions of Eq. (56), ψ(x) ≡ ψλ(x) are eigenstates of this mass operator

(78)

M 2 ψλ(x) = m2

λ ψλ(x) ,

with a suitable set of quantum numbers λ. Solving Eq. (56) with the model potential
of Eq. (73) should lead to results close to the spectrum of the Dirac equation. For the
ground state it is expected to ﬁnd approximately

GS ≈ 1 − Z 2α2 .

8. – Summary and Conclusions

The preceding investigations have shown that the hyperbolic numbers are a helpful
tool for the investigation of relativistic quantum physics. In particular, they oﬀer sim-
pliﬁcations in the description of the relativistic angular momentum. Boost generators
are constructed with a multiplication of the original SO(3) generators by the complex
and the hyperbolic unit. Adding them to the SO(3) generators the Lorentz algebra is
satisﬁed.

The quadratic Dirac equation can be expressed in terms of a 2 × 2-matrix equation
using the hyperbolic numbers. This equation is the starting point for calculations with
non-static single particle potentials. The eigenvalue of the relativistic single particle
equation is the (squared) mass.

In addition, a new quantum number arises compared to the non-relativistic description
or the quasi-relativistic Dirac approximations often used. This quantum number is due to
the consideration of the relative time. The additional quantum number does not indicate
new physics. The three quantum numbers of the orbital angular momentum correspond
to the three quantum numbers of the momentum in the plane wave representation and
are therefore needed for a consistent description of the single particle states.

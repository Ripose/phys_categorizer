Abstract

We show that the Dirac theory of the electron, corresponds to

recent approaches based on a Non commutative spacetime.

1 Introduction

As is well known, in Quantum Theory, as we go down to arbitrarily small
spacetime intervals, we begin to encounter arbitrarily large momenta and
energy. This in Quantum Field Theory manifests itself in the form of diver-
gences. Indeed in the Dirac Theory of the electron [1] the position operator
takes on complex eigen values and it is only after an averaging over intervals
at the Compton scale that we recover usual physics. This non Hermiticity of
the position operator has been recognised for a long time [2, 3], and mean-
ingful position operators have been constructed. The crux of the matter, in
this latter approach, as also in the Foldy-Wolthysen transformation, which
achieves the same purpose [3, 4], is that operators are constructed in such
a way that the so called positive energy spinor and negative energy spinor
of the Dirac bi-spinor wave function, do not mix. This is quite meaningful
because the negative energy spinors are negligible outside the Compton wave-
length region. Indeed, Dirac’s averaging over the Compton scale, referred to,
achieves the same purpose– it eliminates zitterbewegung eﬀects.
The spirit of Dirac’s average spacetime intervals rather than spacetime points
has continued to receive attention over the years in the form of minimum

1

spacetime intervals– from the work of Snyder and Schild to Quantum Super-
string theory [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In modern language, it is symptomatic of
a Non commutative spacetime geometry [12, 13, 14]. We will now highlight
the intimate connection between spin, non commutativity and extension in
the above context.

2 The Non commutative Structure

Indeed Newton and Wigner showed that the correct physical coordinate op-
erator is given by

xk = (1 + γ0)

3/2
p
0
(p0 + µ)1/2

ı∂
∂pk !

−

 

0

p−1/2
(p0 + µ)1/2 E

where E is a projection operator given by

E =

p0(Eγkpk + µ)γ0

1

and the gammas denote the usual Dirac matrices.
To appreciate the signiﬁcance of (1), we ﬁrst consider the case of spin zero.
Then (1) goes over to

xk = ı

∂
∂pk

+

1
8π Z

exp(−µ|(x − y|)
|x − y|

∂
∂y

dy

The ﬁrst term on the right side of (2) denotes the usual position operator,
but the second term represents an imaginary part, which has an extension
∼ 1/µ, the Compton wavelength, exactly as in the case of the Dirac electron.
Returning to Dirac’s treatment [1], the position coordinate is given by

~x =

c2pt
H

ıc¯h(~α − c~pH −1)H −1 ≡

t + ˆx

H being the Hamiltonian operator and α’s the non-commuting Dirac matri-
ces, given by

(1)

(2)

~α =

~σ 0
0 ~σ #

"

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side is the usual (Hermitian) position. The
second term of ~x is the small oscillatory term of the order of the Compton
wavelength, arising out of zitterbewegung eﬀects which averages out to zero.
On the other hand, if we were to work with the (non Hermitian) position
operator in (3), then we can easily verify that the following Non-commutative
geometry holds,

[xı, xj] = αıjl2

where αıj ∼ 0(1).
The relation (4) shows on comparison with the position-momentum commu-
tator that the coordinate ~x also behaves like a ”momentum”. This can be
seen directly from the Dirac theory itself where we have

(4)

(5)

c~α =

−

ˆxH

c2~p
H

2ı
¯h

In (5), the ﬁrst term is the usual momentum. The second term is the extra
”momentum” ~ˆp due to the relations (4).
Infact we can easily verify from (5) that
H 2
¯hc2 ˆx

~ˆp =

(6)

where ˆx has been deﬁned in (3).
We ﬁnally investigate what the angular momentum ∼ ~x × ~p gives - that is,
the angular momentum at the Compton scale. Using (3), we can easily show
that

(~x × ~p)z =

(~α × ~p)z =

(p2α1 − p1α2)

(7)

c
E

c

where E is the eigen value of the Hamiltonian operator H. (7) shows that the
angular momentum leads to the ”mysterious” Quantum Mechanical spin.
In the above considerations, we started with the Dirac equation and de-
duced the underlying Noncommutative geometry of spacetime. Interestingly,
starting with Snyder’s Non commutative geometry, based solely on Lorentz
invariance and a minimum spacetime length, at the Compton scale,

that is, in eﬀect starting with (4), it is possible to deduce the relations (7),(6)
and the Dirac equation itself [10, 15, 16, 17].

[x, y] =

We have thus established the correspondence between considerations start-
ing from the Dirac theory of the electron and Snyder’s (and subsequent)
approaches based on a minimum spacetime interval and Lorentz covariance.

3 Concluding Remarks

We remark that in the usual Quantum Field Theory we encounter diver-
gences which require renormalization. The motivation for the extension of
particles, or the Non commutative structure (4) has been to circumvent these
divergences. In this sense the Non commutative geometry represents ”renor-
malised” coordinates.
We consider in a little more detail[17] the implications of Dirac’s averaging
over the Compton scale.
We consider for simplicity, the free particle Dirac equation. The solutions
are of the type,

ψ = ψA + ψS

where

ψA = e

(10)

Equations (9) and (10) show that the negative energy and positive energy
solutions form a coherent Hilbert space and so the possibility of transition
to negative energy states exists. This diﬃculty however can be overcome by

(8)

the well known Hole theory which uses the Pauli exclusion principle, and is
described in many standard books on Quantum Mechanics.
However the last or interference term on the right side of (10) is like the
zitterbewegung term. When we remember that we really have to consider
averages over space time intervals of the order of ¯h/mc and ¯h/mc2, this term
disappears and eﬀectively the negative energy solutions and positive energy
solutions stand decoupled in what is now the physical universe.
A more precise way of looking at this is[3] that as is well known, for the ho-
mogeneous Lorentz group, p0
|p0| commutes with all operators and yet it is not
a multiple of the identity as one would expect according to Schur’s lemma:
The operator has the eigen values ±1 corresponding to positive and negative
energy solutions. This is a super selection principle [18] pointing to the two
incoherent Hilbert spaces or universes now represented by states ψA and ψS
which have been decoupled owing to the averaging over the Compton scale
spacetime intervals. But the energies we usually consider are such that our
length scale is much greater than the Compton wavelength– as if we were in
the usual poiint spacetime manifold.
Thus once again we see that outside the Compton scale region we recover
the usual physics.
It may be mentioned that in Quantum Superstring theory also we encounter
Non commutative relations like (3)[19].
It may also be mentioned that Zakruzewski has shown from a classical view-
point that spin implies Non commutative spacetime[20].
We ﬁnally make the following comment:
It can easily be veriﬁed that if we specialise to the one dimensional case, then
the Dirac coordinate (3) becomes identical to the Newton-Wigner coordinate,
which latter however deﬁnes a commutative spacetime in three dimensions
(Cf.ref.[3]). Further the Nelson-Nottale approach which uses a double Weiner
stochastic process leads to a complex coordinate on the one hand, and the
Schrodinger equation on the other (Cf.ref.[17] and [21]). Such a complex coor-
dinate also appears in the de Broglie-Bohm approach (Cf.ref.[17] for details).
On the other hand in the Dirac coordinate (3), this additional coordinate
is directly related to zitterbewegung eﬀects. We can see that the double
Weiner process alluded is also connected with such an eﬀect: The negative
time derivative, which does not equal the positive time derivative in this case,
represents negative energy states.
However if we analyse the stochastic Schrodinger equation question further,

5

and generalise the one dimensional case we consider to three dimensions,
then as is well known[22],

ı → ~σ,

where ~σ are the Pauli matrices. In other words, we not only cross over to
special relativity, but also recover the non commutative geometry (4) or Sny-
der’s relations alluded to, at the Compton scale. Thence it is possible to
derive the Dirac equation itself (Cf.ref.[17]).
In other words non commutative spacetime and spin can be shown to origi-
nate from stochastic double Weiner processes at the micro level.

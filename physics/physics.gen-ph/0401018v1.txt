Abstract

The physics of a row of toppling dominoes is discussed.

In particular the
forces between the falling dominoes are analyzed and with this knowledge, the
eﬀect of friction has been incorporated. A set of limiting situations is discussed
in detail, such as the limit of thin dominoes, which allows a full and explicit
analytical solution. The propagation speed of the domino eﬀect is calculated
for various spatial separations. Also a formula is given, which gives explicitly
the main dependence of the speed as function of the domino width, height and
interspacing.

1 Introduction

Patterns formed by toppling dominoes are not only a spectacular view, but their dy-
namics is also a nice illustration of the mechanics of solid bodies. One can study the
problem on diﬀerent levels. Walker [1] gives a qualitative discussion. Banks [2] con-
siders the row of toppling dominoes as a sequence of independent events: one domino
undergoes a free fall, till it hits the next one, which then falls independently of the
others, and so on. He assumes that in the collision the linear momentum along the sup-
porting table is transmitted. This is a naive viewpoint, but it has the advantage that
the calculation can be carried out analytically. A much more thorough treatment has
been given by D. E. Shaw [3]. His aim is to show that the problem is a nice illustration
of computer aided instruction in mechanics. He introduces the basic feature that the
domino, after having struck the next one, keeps pushing on it. So the collision is com-
pletely inelastic. In this way a train develops of dominoes leaning on each other and
pushing the head of the train. One may see this as an elementary demonstration of a
propagating soliton, separating the fallen dominoes from the still upright ones. Indeed
Shaw’s treatment is a simple example how to handle holonomous constraints in a com-
puter program describing the soliton. As collision law he takes conservation of angular
momentum. We will demonstrate, by analyzing the forces between the dominoes, that
this is not accurate. The correction has a substantial inﬂuence on the solition speed,
even more important than the inclusion of friction, which becomes possible when the
forces between the dominoes are known.

The setting is a long row of identical and perfect dominoes of height h, thickness
d and interspacing s.
In order to make the problem tractable we assume that the
dominoes only rotate (and e.g. do not slip on the supporting table). Their fall is due to

1

the gravitational force, with acceleration g. The combination √gh provides a velocity
scale and it comes as a multiplicative factor in the soliton speed. Typical parameters of
the problem are the aspect ratio d/h, which is determined by the type of dominoes used,
and the ratio s/h, which can be easily varied in an experiment. Another characteristic
of the dominoes is their mutual friction coeﬃcient µ which is a small number (
0.2).
The ﬁrst domino gets a gentle push, such that it topples and makes a “free rotation”
till it strikes the second. After the collision the two fall together till they struck the
third and so forth. So we get a succession of rotations and collisions, the two processes
being governed by diﬀerent dynamical laws. Without friction the rotation conserves
energy, while the constraints exclude the energy to be conserved in the collision. In
fact this is the main dissipative element, more than the inclusion of friction.

∼

The goal is to ﬁnd the dependence of the soliton speed on the interdistance s/h.
In the beginning this speed depends on the initial push, but after a while a stationary
pattern develops: a propagating soliton with upright dominoes in front and toppled
dominoes behind. The determination of the forces between the dominoes requires that
we ﬁrst brieﬂy outline the analysis of Shaw. Then we analyze the forces between the
dominoes. Knowing these we make the collision law more precise. With the proper
rotation and collision laws we give the equations for the fully developed solitons. The
next point is the introduction of friction and the calculation of its eﬀect on the soliton
speed. As illustration we discuss the limit of thin dominoes d
0, with permits for
small interseparations a complete analytical solution. Finally we present our results
for the asymptotic soliton speed for various values of the friction and compare them
with some experiments. We also give an explicit formula, which displays the main
dependence of the soliton speed on the parameters of the problem. The paper closes
with a discussion of the results and the assumptions that we have made.

2 Constraints on the Motion

The basic observation is that domino i pushes over domino i+1 and remains in contact
afterwards. So after the contact of i with i + 1 the motion of i is constrained by the
motion of i + 1. Therefore we can take the tilt angle θn of the foremost falling domino,
as the only independent mechanical variable (see Fig. 1). Simple goniometry tells that

h sin(θi −

θi+1) = (s + d) cos θi+1

d.

−

To see this relation it helps to displace domino i+ 1 parallel to itself, till its bottom line
points at the rotation axis of domino i (see Fig. 1). By this relation one can express
the tilt angle θi in terms of the next θi+1 and so on, such that all preceding tilt angles
are expressed in terms of θn. The recursion deﬁnes θi as a function of θn of the form

i.e. the functional dependence on the angle of the head of the train depends only on
the distance n

i. The functions pj(θ) satisfy

with the starting function p0(θ) = θ. They are deﬁned on the interval 0 < θ < θc,

We will call θc the angular distance. From the picture it is clear that the functions
are bounded by the value θ∞, which is the angle for which the right hand side of (1)
vanishes

θ∞ is the angle at which the dominoes are stacked against each other at the end of the
train. We call θ∞ the stacking angle.

In the rectangular traingle ABC the top angle is α = θi −
the length h and the base BC the length (s + d) cos θi+1

−
the hypotenuse and the top angle yields relation (1). In the picture the tilt angle of
the head of chain θn has reached its ﬁnal value θc = arcsin(s/h). The ﬁrst domino has
almost reached the stacking angle θ∞. The normal force fi and the friction force µfi
that domino i exerts on i + 1 are also indicated.

The picture shows that the functions pj(θ) are monotonically increasing functions.
They become ﬂatter and ﬂatter with the index j and converge to the value θ∞ (at
least not too close to the maximum separation s = h, see Section 10). The functions
are strongly interrelated, not only by the deﬁning recursion (3). The angle θi can be
calculated from the head of the train θn by pn−i but also from an arbitrary intermediate
θk by pk−i. This implies

pn−i(θ) = pk−i(pn−k(θ)),

e.g.

pj(θ) = pj−1(p1(θ)).

One easily sees that p1(0) = θc. Therefore one has

pj(0) = pj−1(p1(0)) = pj−1(θc),

a property that will be used later on several times.

An inmediate consequence of (1) is the expression for the angular velocities ωi =

dθ/dt in terms of ωn. From the chain rule of diﬀerentiation we ﬁnd

since p1(0) = θc and w1(0) = 1.

3 Rotation Equations

Without friction, the motion between two collisions is governed by conservation of
energy, which consists out of a potential and a kinetic part. The potential part derives
from the combined height of the center of mass of the falling dominoes, for which we
take the dimensionless quantity

Hn(θn) =

[cos θi + (d/h) sin θi].

(12)

The kinetic part is given by the rotational energy, for which holds

Kn(θn, ωn) = (I/2)

I = (1/3)m(h2 + d2),

(13)

where I is the angular moment of inertia with respect to the rotation axis and m is
the mass of the dominoes. We write the total energy as

En =

We have factored out mgh/2 in (14) as it is an irrelevant energy scale. This has the
advantage that the expression between brackets is dimensionless. The factor I/mgh

provides a time scale that can be incorporated in ωn. From now on we put this factor
equal to unity in the formulae and remember its value when we convert dimensionless
velocities to real velocities.

As mentioned en is a constant during interval n. So we can solve the temporal behavior
of θn from the equation

The initial value for θn is 0 and the ﬁnal value equals the rotational distance θc. The
duration of the time interval where n is the head of the chain, follows by integration

In this time interval the soliton has advanced a distance s + d. The ratio (s + d)/tn
gives the soliton speed, when the head of the train is at n.
In order to integrate
the equations of motion (18) we must have a value for en which basically amounts to
ﬁnding an initial value ωn(0) as one sees from (14). In the next section we outline how
to calculate successively the ωn(0).

Putting all ingredients together we obtain the asymptotic soliton speed vas as

In this formula the time tn is computed from the dimensionless equations (setting
I/mgh equal to 1).

4 The Collision Law, ﬁrst version

We now investigate what happens when domino n hits n + 1. In a very short time
domino n + 1 accumulates an angular velocity ωn+1(0). The change in ωn+1 takes place
while the tilt angles of the falling dominoes hardly change. Shaw [3] postulates that
the total angular momentum of the system is unchanged during the collision. This is
not self-evident and we comment on it in Section 6. Before the collision we have the
angular momentum

After the collision we have

Ln =

wj(θc) ωn(θc).

Ln+1 =

wj(0) ωn+1(0).

Equating these two expressions yields the relation

ωn+1(0) = ωn(θc)

wj(θc)/

wj(0).

With the aid of this value we compute the total energy en+1 and the next integration
can be started. For the ﬁrst time interval holds e0 = 1 + ω2
0(0) since only the zeroth
domino is involved and it starts in upright position with angular velocity ω0(0). The
value of ω0(0) has no inﬂuence on the asymptotic behavior. After a suﬃcient number
of time intervals, a stationary soliton develops.

5 Forces between the Dominoes

Conservation of energy requires the dominoes to slide frictionless over each other.
Before we can introduce friction we have to take a closer look at the forces between the
falling dominoes. Without friction the force which i exerts on i + 1 is perpendicular to
the surface of i + 1 with a magnitude fi (see Fig. 1). Consider to begin with the head
of the train n. Domino n feels the gravitational pull with a torque Tn

Tn = (sin θn −

(d/h) cos θn)/2,

(24)

and a torque from domino n
respect to the rotation point of n. The equation of motion for n becomes

1 equal to the force fn−1 times the moment arm with

bi = h cos(θi −

θi+1).

Note that the ﬁrst equation (25) is just a special case with fn = 0. Another interesting
features is that ai < bi. So i gains less from i
1 looses to i. Therefore
dominoes, falling concertedly, gain less angular momentum than if they would fall
independently. This will have a consequence on the application of conservation of
angular momentum in the collision process. We come back on this issue in the next
section.

We can eliminate the forces from the equation by multiplying (25) with r0 = 1 and

the general equation with rn−i and chosing the values of rj such that

rj = rj−1

rn−i =

Now observe that the recursion for the rj is identical to that of the wj as given in (10).
With r0 = 1 we may identify rj = wj. It means that if we multiply (29) with ωn and
replace rn−iωn by ωi, we recover the conservation of energy in the form

(30)

It is not diﬃcult to write the sum of the torques as the derivative with respect to time
of the potential energy, thereby casting the conservation of energy in the standard
form. So if conservation of energy holds, the elimination of the forces is superﬂuous.
However, equation (29) is more general and we use it in the treatment of friction.

6 The Collision, second version

We have assumed that in the collision of the head of chain n with the next domino n+1
conserves angular momentum. Having a more detailed picture of forces between the
sliding dominoes we reconsider this assumption. In this section without friction and
in Section 8 with friction. The idea is that in the collision domino n, exerts a impulse
on n + 1 and vice versa with opposite sign. In other words: one has to integrate the
equations of motion of the previous section over such a short time that the positions
do not change, but that the velocities accumulate a ﬁnite diﬀerence. However, not
only the jump in velocity propagates downwards, also the impulses have to propagate
downwards in order to realize these jumps. Denoting the impulses by capital F ’s,
domino i receives Fi from i + 1 and Fi−1 from i
1. So we get for the jumps in the
rotational velocity

The functions ai and bi are the same as those deﬁned in (27). If we would have ai = bi
we could add all equations and indeed ﬁnd that the angular total angular momentum
is conserved in the collision. But only an = bn since θn+1 = 0. The impulse Fi can be
eliminated in the same way as before by multiplying the ith equation with rn+1−i and
adding them up. For the coeﬃcient of ωn+1(0) we get

In our frictionless case rj = wj and therefore Jn+1 = In+1(0). So the desired relation
reads

In+1(0) ωn+1(0) = (In+1(0)

1) ωn(θc) = In(θc) ωn(θc).

−
We have added the last equality since it smells as a conservation of angular momentum
using the eﬀective angular moment of inertia I(θ). This inertia moment is however
linked to the energy and not to the angular momentum. The true angular momentum
conservation is given in Section 4. It is also not conservation of kinetic energy. Then
the squares of the angular velocities would have to enter. The diﬀerence with the
earlier relation (23) is that the sum involves the squares of the w’s. This has a notable
inﬂuence on the asymptotic velocity.

7 Fully Developed Solitons

After a suﬃcient number of rotations and collisions a stationary state sets in. Then
we may identify in the collision law the entry ωn+1(0) with ωn(0). This allows to solve
for the stationary ωn(0). We use (11) to relate the eﬀective moments of inertia

8 Friction

After all this groundwork it is relatively simple to introduce friction. Let us start with
the equation of motion (26). Friction adds a force parallel to the surface of i + 1. For
the strength of the friction force we assume the law of Amonton-Coulomb [4]

ffriction = µf,

where f is the corresponding perpendicular force. Inclusion of friction means that the
coeﬃcients ai and bi pick up a frictional component. The associated torques follow
from the geometry of Fig. 1. So the values of the ai and bi change to

ai = h cos(θi −
bi = h cos(θi −

Then we may eliminate the forces as before, which again leads to (29). But we cannot
identify any longer ri with wi. In order to use (29) we must express the accelerations
dωi/dt in the head of chain dωn/dt. This follows from diﬀerentiating (8)

The vj can be calculated from the recursion relation, that follows from diﬀerentiating

Next we insert (47) into (26) and obtain

9 Thin Dominoes

Sometimes limits help to understand the general behaviour. One of the parameters,
which has played sofar a modest role, is the aspect ratio d/h. In our formulae it is
perfectly possible to take this ratio 0. In practice inﬁnitely thin dominoes are a bit
weird, because with paperthin dominoes one has e.g. to worry about friction with the
air. In this limit we can vary s/h over the full range from 0 to 1. In Fig. 2 we have
plotted the asymptotic velocity as function of the separation s/h. The curve is rather
ﬂat with a gradual drop–oﬀ towards the large separtions. We discuss here the two
limits where the separation goes to 0 and where it approaches its maximum s = h.
Both oﬀer some insight in the overall behavior.

Inﬁnitesimal Separation

If the dominoes are narrowly separated, the head of chain rotates only over a small
s/h and the collisions will rapidly succeed each other. The
angle θc = arcsin(s/h)
number of dominoes with a tilt angle θi between 0 and π/2 becomes very large and
slowly varying with the index i. So a continuum description is appropriate. We ﬁrst
focus on the dependence of θi(θn) on the index i and later comment on the dependence
on the weak variation with θn (which is conﬁned to the small interval 0 < θn < θc).
We take as coordinate x the distance of domino i.

x = i s/h

and use ν = ns/h for the position of the head of the train. Then

θi = θ(x),

θi+1 = θ(x + dx),

with dx = s/h. So for d = 0 and s/h

0 the constraint (1) becomes

sin[ θ(x)

θ(x + dx) ] = dx cos θ(x + dx),

Here we have used the boundary condition that θ(ν) = 0. Not surprisingly we ﬁnd
that the shape of the tilt angles is a function of the diﬀerence with respect to the head
of the train. The above expression gives the shape of the soliton.

Next we comment on the dependence of this proﬁle on the angle θn. As mentioned
it can be only weak as the interval for θn is narrow. Thus it suﬃces to know a few
derivatives and for that, the interpretation (10) is useful. The behavior of wj in the
continuum limit, follows from the diﬀerential form of the recursion relation

What still is needed is the propagation velocity of the soliton, or in the present
language: how fast n or ν moves with time. As the foremost domino rotates over
s/h, the head of train covers the distance s/h with the rotation
a small angle θc ≃
velocity ωn. So the propagation speed equals ωn. As before, ωn has to be distilled
from the laws of rotation and collision. Since this section is mainly for illustration, we
restrict ourselves to the frictionless case.

h, also a simpliﬁcation occurs. Here
On the other side, near maximal separation s
the number of dominoes involved in the train is restricted to a few. The head of the
train rotates over almost π/2 before it strikes the next domino. So one comes close
to the picture of Banks [2] in which the toppling of the dominoes is a succession of
independent events. There is however a diﬀerence resulting from the constraint (1).
Inmediate after the collision, the dominoes n and n + 1 rotate with equal velocity
ωn(θc) = ωn+1(0). This is a consequence of the fact that after the collision, one still
has θn+1 = 0. Thus we ﬁnd for the energy after the collision

en+1 = 1 + 2ω2

n+1(0).

All other dominoes have fallen down and domino n + 1 is still upright (the 1 in (67)).
Once n+1 starts rotating, the value of ωn rapidly drops down to 0. Inspecting recursion
(10), with p0(θn+1) = θn+1 and p1(θn+1) = θn, one sees that the factor cos(θn −
cos(θc) is very close to 0. The ratio approaches

This has an eﬀect on the moment of inertia I(θn+1) deﬁned in (15). Inmediately after
the collision the value of I(θn+1) equals 2, being the sum of w2
n = 1. A
small angle further it has dropped to 1, since wn drops to 0. As the energy is conserved
the kinetic energy of domino n is transferred to domino n + 1. So ωn+1 rises by a factor
√2 in a short interval. Therefore we start the integration of the time after this sudden
increase, using the conservation law for the energy

n+1 = 1 and w2

The collision law for this degenerate case becomes

ωn+1(0) = ωn(θc)/2.

Note that since the wj are either 1 or 0, there is no diﬀerence between the proposal by
Shaw (see (23)) and ours (see (35)).

The stationary state is obtained by the identiﬁcation ωn(θc) = ωn+1(θc). Combining
(70) and (71) then yields ωn+1(0) = 1/√2. Thus the time integral for the interval

The reciprocal yields the asymptotic soliton speed vas = 0.73

The story of thin dominoes gives a warning on the numerical integration scheme.
For small separations we need many intervals before the asymptotic behaviour has set
in. On the other hand we do not need many points in the integration for the time of
a rotation. For wide separations it is the opposite: only a few intervals are needed for
the asymptotic behavior, but we have to perform the time integration with care. The
factor I(θ) in the energy law is rapidly varying for small θ. So we need many points
for small θ to be accurate.

In Fig. 2 we have also plotted the curve due to Banks [2] in the limit of thin

dominoes. The diﬀerence is due to the collision law, for which Banks takes

ωn+1(0) = cos θc ωn(θc).

(73)

The factor cos θc accounts for the horizontal component of the linear momentum. For
large separations this gives quite a diﬀerent value, since the transmission of linear
momentum becomes ineﬃcient. For small separations the transmission is nearly perfect
(as becomes our collision law). The conservation of energy of a single rotating domino
reads

ω2(θ) + cos θ = ω2(0) + 1.

For the stationary state we insert (73) into (74) and get

ω2(θc) =

cos θc
cos2 θc

For small θc, the value ω(θc) approaches 1/√2, which is again substantially smaller
than our limiting value 1. The reason is that the dominoes, which keep leaning onto
each other and onto the head of the train, speed up the soliton.

10 Calculations and Limitations

For the frictionless case we can use the formulae of Section 7, i.e. ﬁrst calculate the
asymptotic value of ω(0) and then integrate the rotation equation to ﬁnd the time
between two collisions and thus the asymptotic soliton speed. With friction we must

Table 1: The asymptotic soliton speed (d/h = 0.179) for the collision law of Shaw and
for various degrees of friction with the collision law (34).

iteratively ﬁnd ω(0), by trying a value of ω(0), then solve equation (50) for ω(θc) and
ﬁnally apply the collision law in order to see whether we come back to our trial ω(0).
A form of iteration is to start the train with one domino and an arbitrary initial ω0(0)
and let the train grow longer such that an asymptotic pattern develops.

In Table 1 we have summarized the results. The thickness to height ratio is set at
d/h = 0.179 since this is the only value on which experiments [6] are reported. The ﬁrst
column gives the separation s/h, the second the soliton speed using Shaw’s collision law
and the third gives the results for ours (35). In the subsequent columns the inﬂuence
of the friction is indicated. Note that the reduction of the speed due to the change of
the collision law is larger than that of modest friction. The curves corresponding to
these values are shown in Fig. 3, which also contains the experiments of Maclachlan
et al. They suggest that the soliton speed diverges for short distances, while we ﬁnd a
maximum. Their values seem to correspond best with the friction coeﬃcient µ = 0.3.
We found empirically the value µ = 0.2, by estimating the angle of the supporting
table at which dominoes start to slide over each other.

In order to make the behavior of fully developed solitons more transparant, we may

with ω(θ) the solution of (39). This average is a number close to 1/√P (with P deﬁned

slightly less than 1/√P . Then we get for the asymptotic soliton speed the formula

Figure 3: The inﬂuence of friction on the asymptotic soliton speed for the aspect ratio
d/h = 0.179. The dots are the experimental values of Maclachlan et al. [6].

Here we have reinstalled the factor I/mgh in order to include in this formula, all
the factors that contribute to the velocity. The factor Q is shown as function of s/h
for various d/h in Fig. 4. One may consider Q as the main factor determining the
dependence of the soliton speed on the parameters of the problem. The fraction in
(77) is a reﬁnement which requires a detailed calculation. We found that this fraction
is virtually independent of the aspect ratio d/h. It stays close to 1 for the the major
part of the range of practical separations. Only around the already “unworkable”
separation s/h = 0.9 the value has increased some 10%. A good indicator for the
behavior is the curve for the frictionless thin dominoes which is the product of the
fraction and Q = √3 s/(h arcsin(s/h).

We mentioned in Section 7 that the function P as given by (42) has to be positive
for the existence of the domino eﬀect. This gives a bound on the minimal distance s/h,
which can be cast in the form

−
Separations smaller than the value of (79) do not show the domino eﬀect and slightly
above that limit the train has diﬃculty to develop. The reason is that after a while,
too many dominoes of the train get tilt angles, which have a higher potential energy
than an upright domino. Ultimately the fraction of these dominoes in the train looses
out against the dominoes at the end of the train, which are tilted at the stacking angle
(with a potential energy lower than an upright domino). One can overcome this barrier
by starting with an unreasonble high initial ω0(0). So (79) is the true theoretical limit,
but in practice the domino eﬀect will not start for slightly larger values of s/h.

Another limitation of the theory is at the other side. The dominoes at the end of
the train are tilted at the stacking angle θ∞ provided the height h is suﬃciently large.

Beyond this value the train is actually shorter than blind application of the formulae
would suggest. It is not so interesting to sort out what precisely happens if (81) is
violated, since then the no-slip condition for the dominoes is highly questionable. For
such wide separations the force on the struck domino has hardly a torque to rotate
it. It rather induces the rotation axis to slide along the table. In fact, as a practical
limitation, we look to the height of impact. If it is above the center of mass of the
struck domino, it will start to rotate and below that value, it may slip if the friction
with the supporting table is not large enough. This criterion yields the limit to the
distance

s/h < √3 /2 = 0.87,

(82)

which is already a large separation, not far from the limit set by (81) for d/h = 0.179.
For very thin dominoes (79) is hardly a limitation. However, (79) and (82) form
a window of separations for the existence of the domino eﬀect, which depends on the
thickness d/h. This window narrows down to zero and the domino eﬀect disappears
for

h3 < hd2 + 4d3/√3 ,

or

d/h < 0.3787

(83)

This estimate comes close to the one given by Freericks [5]. Friction also makes the
excluded interval larger. For µ = 0.2 we have not found a domino eﬀect for s/h < 0.07,

16

which is, for d/h = 0.179, about 7 times the theoretical limit. So our estimate (83) for
the upper thickness is still too optimistic.

11 Discussion

We have studied the toppling of a row of equally spaced dominoes under the assump-
tions that the dominoes only rotate and that they keep leaning onto each other after a
collision with the next one. By and large we follow the treatment of Shaw [3], who intro-
duced the constraint (1), which synchronizes the motion of train of toppling dominoes.
By analyzing the mutual forces between the dominoes, we have corrected his collision
law and we could also account for the eﬀect of friction between the dominoes. The
correction of the collision law is more important than the inﬂuence of friction, given the
small friction coeﬃcient between dominoes. The limit of thin dominoes d/h
0 leads
to a completely tractable model. For large separations we encounter a situation which
resembles the viewpoint of Banks [2], seeing the toppling as a succession of independent
events. However his collision law diﬀers substantially from ours and cannot be recon-
ciled with the force picture that we develop. We give a formula (77), which displays
explicitly the main dependence of the soliton speed on the parameters of the problem.
The maximum speed which can be reached, appears close to the closest separation for
which the domino eﬀect exists.

→

The assumptions, on which our calculation are based, are the no-slip condition and
the constraint (1). One can help the no-slip condition by increasing the friction with
the supporting table (putting them on sandpaper as Walker [1] does). If the no-slip
condition is violated, it is the end of the domino eﬀect as the dominoes are kicked over
with the wrong rotation. We argue that this will happen when the falling domino hits
the next one below its center of mass.

The constraint (1) is implied by the assumption that the collision is fully inelastic.
This assumption is supported by slow motion pictures of the eﬀect, which show that
the dominoes indeed lean onto each other while falling. It is an interesting question
what happens, if the collision would be less inelastic. The extreme opposite, fully
elastic collisions, yields an ever increasing soliton speed. A falling domino increases its
rotation velocity as soon as its center of mass goes down. If this is fully transmitted
to the next domino, the rotation velocity keeps increasing. In that case friction can
not play a role since the dominoes do not touch each other. In the less extreme case of
partially inelastic collisions, the dominoes also rotate without contact, but friction can
play a role during the collision. As Fig. 1 indicates, friction always rotates the mutual
impulse such, that the torque on the next one decreases and that the reaction torque
increases. This will slow down the train and a stationary state can develop. Therefore
it would be interesting to experiment with dominoes of diﬀerent making (e.g. steel) to
see the increase in the soliton speed.

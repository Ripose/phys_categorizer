I. INTRODUCTION

loses energies and there is a discussion: may humankind
be provided with part of these energies.

The fractal model of space and time [1]- [16] treats
the time and the space with fractional dimensions as real
ﬁelds. Universe is formed only by these ﬁelds , i.e. our
Universe is fractional material time and fractional mate-
rial space and include not any more. As the time and
the space are material ﬁelds with fractional dimensions
and multifractal structure (multifractal sets) they deﬁned
In each time (or
on sets of their carriers of measure.
space) point ( ”points” are approach for very small in-
tervals of time or space and ”intervals” are multifractal
sets with global dimensions for its sets playing role of lo-
cal dimensions for Universe in whole ) the dimensions of
time (or space) determine densities of Lagrangians energy
for all physical ﬁelds ( or new physical ﬁelds for space)
in these points. Time and space are binding by relation
dr2 −c2dt2 = 0 (this relation is only good approach, more
precise relations see at [2]). As real ﬁelds time and space
own huge supply of energy ( the question about its energy
was considered partly at [16]) and these energies may be
evaluated. The purpose of this paper is more detailed
consideration ( in the mathematical formalism of multi-
fractal model of time and space presented in [1]- [16]) of
problem existence huge supply of energy owned by each
element of time and space. The reason having energy lay
in multifractal nature of time and space, i.e. multifractal
nature of our Universe. Time and space formed Uni-
verse and by means of their multifractal dimensions con-
struct picture of all physical ﬁelds and got huge amount
of energy when Universe was born.
In the [16] where
evaluated these energies for case if current time must be
turned back. In this paper we consider continually loses
of these energies by time and space, evaluate values of

II. WHAT ARE ENERGY DENSITIES OF TIME
AND SPACE REAL FIELDS IN MULTIFRACTAL
UNIVERSE?

For answer on these questions it is necessary to con-
struct and investigate equations describing behavior of
very small ”intervals” of space and time ( in considered
theory each minimal interval space or time ( i.e. multi-
fractal sets) treats as a ”point” [1]- [16]). It is well known
that behavior of objects with very small sizes describes
by quantum laws. Equations for moving such objects
are equations describing diﬀusion with imaginary coeﬃ-
cient of diﬀusion. Then equations for space point xp and
time point tp may be written in the frame of multifrac-
tal theory of time and space as quantum equations with
generalized fractional derivatives (GFD) [1] - [16].

[16]). Following these works we consider both time and
space as the initial real material ﬁelds existing in the
world and generating all other physical ﬁelds by means
of their fractal dimensions. Assume that every of them
consists of a continuous, but not diﬀerentiable bounded

set of small intervals (these intervals further treated as
”points”). Consider the set of small time intervals St
(their sizes may be evaluated in rude approach as Planck
sizes). Let time be deﬁned on multifractal subsets of such
intervals, deﬁned on certain measure carrier RN . Each
interval of these subsets (or ”points”) is characterized by
the fractional (fractal) dimension (FD) dt(r(t), t) and for
diﬀerent intervals FD are diﬀerent. In this case the clas-
sical mathematical calculus or fractional (say, Riemann -
Liouville) calculus [19] can not be applied to describe a
small changes of a continuous function of physical values
f (t), deﬁned on time subsets St, because the fractional
exponent depends on the coordinates and time. There-
fore, we have to introduce integral functionals (both left-
sided and right-sided) which are suitable to describe the
dynamics of functions deﬁned on multifractal sets (see
[1]- [3]). Actually, these functionals are simple and nat-
ural generalization of the Riemann-Liouville fractional
derivatives and integrals:

where Γ(x) is Euler’s gamma function, and a and b are
some constants from [0, ∞). In these deﬁnitions, as usu-
ally, n = {d} + 1 , where {d} is the integer part of d if
d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤ d < n) and n = 0 for d < 0.
If
d = const, the generalized fractional derivatives (GFD)
(1)-(2) coincide with the Riemann - Liouville fractional
derivatives (d ≥ 0) or fractional integrals (d < 0). When
d = n+ε(t), ε(t) → 0, GFD can be represented by means
of integer derivatives and integrals. For n = 1, that is,
d = 1 + ε, |ε| << 1 it is possible to obtain:

where a is a constant and determined by choice of the
rules of regularization of integrals ( [1]- [2], [7]) (for more
detailed see [7]) and the last addendum in the right hand
side of (5) is very small. The selection of the rule of reg-
ularization that gives a real additives for usual deriva-
tive in (3) yield a = 0.5 for d < 1 [1]. The functions
under integral sign in (3)-(4) we consider as the gener-
alized functions deﬁned on the set of the ﬁnite functions
[20]. The notions of GFD, similar to (3)-(4), can also
be deﬁned and for the space variables r. The deﬁnitions
of GFD (3)-(4) needs in connections between fractal di-
mensions of time dt(r(t), t) and characteristics of physical
ﬁelds (say, potentials Φi(r(t), t), i = 1, 2, ..) or densities
of Lagrangians Li) and it was deﬁned in cited works. Fol-
lowing [1]- [15], we deﬁne this connection by the relation

sake of independence from regularization constant). The
deﬁnition of time as the system of subsets and deﬁnition
of the FD for dt (see (6)) connects the value of fractional
(fractal) dimension dt(r(t), t) with each time instant t.
The latter depends both on time t and coordinates r. If
dt = 1 (an absence of physical ﬁelds) the set of time has
topological dimension equal to unity. The multifractal
model of time allows ( as was be shown [5]) to consider
the divergence of energy of masses moving with speed of
light in the SR theory as the result of the requirement of
rigorous validity of the laws pointed out in the beginning
of this paper in the presence of physical ﬁelds (in the
multifractal theory there are only approximate fulﬁllment
of these laws). We bound consideration only the case
when relation dt = 1 − ε(r(t), t)), |ε| ≪ 1 are fulﬁlled. In
that case the GFD (as was shown) may be represented
(as a good approach) by ordinary derivatives and relation
(1, (5)) are valid. So the equations (1) -(2) reeds ( we
used for GFD approach of (5)( [16]))

IV. WHERE THE LOSEES ENERGY GO TO?
WHY WE DID NOT DISCOVERED IT TILL NOW

This energy belongs to ”point” with coordinate xp. In
the considered model multifractal time and space each
points is multifractal set with global dimensions dt or
dr. Let us characterize the volumes of these points by
Planck sizes: tp ∼ 10−44sec, xp ∼ 10−33cm. The density
of energy in the one cm3 is equal

E ∼ 1060ev

(12)

So each cubic centimeter of space has such huge en-
ergy. This gigantic energy is determined by fractional
dimensions of time in the domain of space where we live.
The energy determined by fractional dimensions of space
(ε(t(r), r)) may be evaluated if ﬁnd value of the fractional
additives in this case. What is nature of these energies?
It originates by all physical ﬁelds born by fractional di-
mensions of time ( fractional dimensions gravitational,
weak-electro-magnetic, strong interaction and so on and
their vacuum ). We took into account only gravitational
ﬁeld as example. There are vacuum states of all phys-
ical ﬁelds in any point of our Universe, they give con-
stant additives at fractional dimensions (stress diﬀerence
of vacuum physical ﬁelds from vacuum (carrier of mea-
sure) that born our Universe). Thus huge energies of
space and time are constructed by the multifractal struc-
ture of our world and are consequences of multifractal
nature Universe.

III. HOW MUCH ENERGIES TIME AND SPACE
CONTINUALLY LOSE?

The huge supply of energy are constructed by the frac-
tional nature of time and space . The relation (10) (or
analogies relation for time volume) demonstrated dimin-
ishing of fractal structure with increasing time ﬂow and
with space expending. Both time and space tends to the
state where their fractal structures tends to zero and it
will the end of Universe. How much energy time lose
each second? The relation (10) allows to evaluate its
value. We use (10) and write

where τ = t − t0 is a current time. So the losees space
energy by one cm3sec are

△E ∼ −

¯hετ
t2
0

△E ∼ 1043evsec

This is the huge ﬂow of energy (in our case the ﬂow of
gravitation ﬁeld energy, because we do not consider ﬂows
of other ﬁelds). Where this energy going to?

(13)

(14)

It seems only one the answer at the question put above
exist: the ﬂow of energy are born by diminishing of frac-
tal structure of space and time goes directly to the carrier
of measure that created our Universe. The fractal the-
ory of time and space now are in study of construction
thou main principle of it formulated and main predic-
tion are made ( see [1]- [16]). Our Universe connected
(bind) with vacuum (measure carrier) and continually re-
turns it the energy that got when ”big bang” happened.
So Universe must be ﬁlled of ”radiation” (gravitational,
electro-magnetic and so on energy ﬂows ) that it con-
tinually losing. We mention once yet that in the form
of these energy ﬂows the time and the space (Universe)
directly return the energy (it is the energy they had got
from the carrier of measure (physical vacuum) that born
them when ”big bang” had happened) back to the car-
rier of measure (vacuum). Universe behaves himself as a
big reserver of energy strong connected with vacuum and
directly return vacuum her energy. Stress that carrier of
measure in considered model of fractal world not belongs
our Universe ( as forest not belongs Earth till it died).
The Universe (Universe consists of the real ﬁelds of time
and the space) only deﬁned on the carrier of measure
as part of it and may be many such Universes deﬁned
on the same carrier of measure. So time an space con-
stantly return energy to carrier of measure in the form
of energy ﬂows diminishing the fractal structure and de-
creases gigantic energy of all physical ﬁelds. We can not
see or sense these energies as we can not sense for exam-
ple very low frequency of electro-magnetic ﬁeld. For ex-
perimental discovers of these ﬂows (time ﬂows and space
ﬂows) it seems necessary some a new devices based on a
new theory of vacuum that born our Universe and more
deep penetration in the nature of time and space ﬁelds.
Physics needs more knowledge about the nature of carrier
of measure, characteristics of interactions between time
and space ﬁelds and measure carrier. These problems
may be solved in future.

V. IS IT POSSIBLE TO EXTRACT THE ENERGY
FROM FIELDS OF TIME OR SPACE?

As was shown in the above paragraph the multifractal
theory of time and space the real ﬁelds of time and space
are ﬁlled by energy. The one cm3 only space ﬁeld is a
container of the huge amount of energy because only lose
of energy during one second of time consists ∼ 1043ev.
The energy of rest mass is almost nothing as compared
with this energy. This energy transfers directly in the
measure carrier (see above paragraphs). Is it possible ex-
tract it and use for practical purpose? It is very diﬃcult
to answer on this question now because there are many
non researched problems in the theory of real fractal time

and space ﬁelds. This problem is one of the main prob-
lems of the theory . If somebody asks the Neanderthal
man about possibility to use for needs of his tribe the
energy of water ﬂow of near river what he will answer?
He could not even understand what he was asked about.
Now the method of transferring of the energy of physi-
cal ﬁelds ﬂows directly at the energy ﬁelds of carrier of
measure unknown for mankind. What new devises must
be invented for discover and using these ﬂows of energy?
What new physics needs for it? Nobody can answer on
these question now exactly. Nevertheless for any ener-
getical ﬂow must exist some of stopping ﬂow devices that
may take some of ﬂow energies. I think early or later such
devices will be invented. For it the new theory of vacuum
is necessary . Now such the theory of vacuum is absent.
It is necessary ﬁnd out how correctly describe interac-
tions between time and space ﬂows, physical ﬁelds plows
and measure carrier (vacuum). If it will be done (nobody
knows how much time it needs) the stopping (bar) ﬂows
devices will be invented. We suppose that these prob-
lems will be solved in future then the two problem are
decided:
a)the problem of sources of any amount of energy;
b) the problem of governing by time, because the taking
energy from time ﬁeld ﬂow partly stopped or partly in-
verse the time ﬂow.

In the beginning of the last century had appeared the
known relation E = mc2.
It was not simple under-
stand its inﬂuence on human life. It relation allowed hu-
mankind to develop new technology of atomic era. May
be huge amount of energy condensed in the time and
the space ﬁelds allow mankind in future era use it too.
How to do it nobody knows now. May be very intensive
beams of electro-magnetic ﬁeld energy received by means
of beams of particles moving with speed of light ( see [4])
allow to do ”the opening” in the time ﬁeld and to re-
ceive from it energy? Is it is possible to use the energy of
long wave” vibrations” that ﬁlled Universe? Optimistic
point of view allows to have hope that in future these new
sources of energy when energy may be got directly from
time and space ﬁelds ﬂows (in case that the fractal the-
ory of time and space will ﬁnd experimental veriﬁcation)
may be used.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

1.The multifractal theory of time and space forecast
existence of gigantic supply of energy in the real time
and space ﬁelds (the order of these losees is 1060evsec);
2. The multifractal theory of time and space forecast
existence of gigantic losees of energy by each volumes of
space and time (the order of these losees is 1043evsec);
3. Discussion of possibilities to use the huge supply of
time ﬁeld and space ﬁeld energies by humankind gives
more optimistic then pessimistic perspective for future

of mankind.

The mass of the bubble in the ﬂuid can be taken as the mass of the vapor in it. The self-energy of
the bubble is deﬁned as the work performed against the pressure of the ﬂuid in order to create the
bubble. Taking the vapor to be an ideal gas the relationship between the self-energy, mass of the
bubble and the speed of the perturbation wave in a turbulent incompressible ﬂuid can be obtained.

Keywords: ﬂuid, Reynolds turbulence, perturbation wave, vapor bubble, mass, energy

We consider perturbations of the averaged turbulence in an incompressible ﬂuid. The speed c of the turbulence

perturbation wave was shown1 to be related with the background level of Reynolds stresses as
1u′

2i(0) = hu′

1i(0) = hu′

c2 = hu′

3i(0)

2u′

3u′

where u′

i are turbulent ﬂuctuations of the ﬂuid velocity u = hui + u′ and h..i the averaging over a short time interval.
Let a bubble be included into the ﬂuid, and V ∗ the volume of the turbulent ﬂuid evaporated into the bubble.
The kinetic energy K ∗ transferred with the ﬂuid into the gas phase can be found knowing the volume density of the
turbulence energy of the ﬂuid

where ̺ is the density of the ﬂuid. Calculating K ∗ for the unperturbed medium we ﬁnd from (2) with the account of

The vapor will be assumed to behave as an ideal gas. The equation of state of the ideal gas can be written in the
form

In the mechanical equilibrium the gas pressure p must be equal to the ﬂuid pressure hpi. If V is the volume of the
bubble then using (3) in (4) we get for a bubble in the unperturbed medium with the background pressure p0:

The mass of the bubble can be determined from the mass of the gas contained in it

The self-energy of a bubble can be deﬁned as the work needed in order to create the bubble in the unperturbed
medium

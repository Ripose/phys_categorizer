Abstract

A novel data compression scheme is presented. The method is very suitable for
black and white images, and it can generate a compression factor of eight; in general
the bitmap is optimized for an arbitary number of colors and not only for unused
information contained in a conventional bitmap with 2j bits per pixel. This compres-
sion method can be incorporated with other compression methods; it is suitable for
other image types and audio. The potential high compression factor is cost eﬀective
for both memory and bandwidth requirements.

Data compression is increasingly important due to the size and type of infor-
mation required to be manipulated. There are many ways of compressing data. An
often overlooked aspect is to eliminate the redundancy of disk space within the actual
byte. Each byte consists of eight digits, and an image sometimes only requires one
entry, which is a redundancy of an order of magnitude; in a colored grayscale, an
optimistic factor of two in compression is beneﬁcial. Eliminating this redundancy is
quite simple.

Examine a black and white image with 768x768 pixels when each pixel is associ-
ated with a byte. The bit can take values 1 or 0 when the image is monotone, but can
range in more values when associated with color or a gray scale. In the color example,
there are 256 values contained in the byte, with a fraction of the values unused. This
algorithm eliminates the wasteful unused fraction.

The entire image could be associated with a single number using a polytopic
deﬁnition of the image [1]. As an example, consider one row of the image, and specify
the image by a base expansion,

The base reduction of the number speciﬁes the line’s image as entries of ai, either one
or zero. In a colored context with Nc colors, the number could be expanded as

N =

ai2i .

with the the numbers bi ranging from 0 to Nc − 1. Subsequently, the number is stored
in the usual fashion in the computer’s memory, using the required number of bytes.

Each individiual number speciﬁes the line’s image, but in grouping the image as
a number, and in a colored base, the redundancy of the byte is eliminated. In a black
and white format, the eight entries of the byte are now associated with eight pixels.
This compression factor is non-trivial, but quite simple to implement.

The number 2769 requred to store the line’s information seems large, as it has 231
digits in base ten. However, the data storage required in the actual memory requires
only 769 entries, and is only 96 bytes in total. The compression of a factor eight also
has no loss of information. In the case of the colored context, the compression ratio
is still non-trivial, but not quite an order of magnitude; the number of colors versus
the bytes per pixel is the limiting factor.

The data compression is also suitable to implement with other compression schemes,

such as the simple RLE approach. Count the consecutive 1’s or 0’s and insterpace
a number with a marker to label the continuity. The marked number could be an
8-bit number immediately adjacent to the occurance of the 0 and placed within the
number N. The redundancy of the bytes is still eliminated with the 1 or 0 specifying
the pixel reduced to a single bit, and not a byte, or a fraction of a byte in the ’colored’
example.

This compression scheme is quite simple to implement, but it appears not be
in the literature. A compression factor of eight is surely not to be overlooked, as
hardware associated with memory allocation is quite costly when large amounts of
data are required. Also, the simplest image examples, which are black and white
images, can have an impact on data communication; a reduction of almost an order
of magnitude in bandwidth can be quite appealing.
In the colored example, the
unused values of the pixel memory are eliminated; for example, using an 8-bit per
pixel memory allocation for only an odd number such as 50 ’colors’ would lead to a
further double in the compression.

The compression scheme described here is very conservative, and has no loss of
information. It is suitable in a wide range of contexts. Also, the polytopic deﬁnition
of the image as a number can possibly examined in further compression schemes [2]
involving only information as a pure number.

Abstract

The galactic ‘dark matter’ eﬀect is regarded as one of the major problems in
fundamental physics. Here it is explained as a self-interaction dynamical eﬀect
of space itself, and so is not caused by an unknown form of matter. Because it
was based on Kepler’s Laws for the motion of the planets in the solar system the
Newtonian theory of gravity was too restricted. A reformulation and generalisation
of the Newtonian theory of gravity in terms of a velocity in-ﬂow ﬁeld, representing
at a classical level the relative motion of a quantum-foam substructure to space,
reveals a key dynamical feature of the phenomenon of gravity, namely the so called
‘dark matter’ eﬀect, which manifests not only in spiral galaxy rotation curves, but
also in the borehole g anomaly, globular and galactic black holes, and in ongoing
problems in improving the accuracy with which Newton’s gravitational constant G
is measured. The new theory of gravity involves an additional new dimensionless
gravitational constant, and experimental data reveals this to be the ﬁne structure
constant. The new theory correctly predicts the globular cluster black hole masses,
that the so-called ‘dark matter’ networks revealed via weak gravitational lensing are
caused by quantum-foam vortex ﬁlaments, and that the ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect is
caused by vorticity in the in-ﬂow. The relationship of the new theory of gravity to
General Relativity which, like Newtonian gravity, does not have the ‘dark matter’
dynamics, is explained.

Introduction

The ‘dark matter’ eﬀect ﬁrst came to notice some 60 years ago from observations
of a mass paradox in galaxies and galactic clusters by Oort (1932) [1]; the dynam-
ical estimates of the local matter density diﬀered from that determined from the
luminosity. Zwicky (1933) [2] measured the radial velocities of galaxies in the Coma
cluster and also found that there was a mass discrepancy, with the required mass,
based on the Newtonian theory of gravity, being ten-fold greater than that deduced
from the luminosities. This supposedly extra ‘mass’ was called ‘dark matter’ because
it produced no luminosity. In 1959 Kahn and Woltjer [3] noticed that the relative
motion of the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way galaxy suggested again a ten-
fold mass discrepancy. Then Einasto [4], Sizikov [5] and Freeman [6] realised that
the rotation velocities in the outer regions of spiral galaxies were again much greater
than expected from the luminosity. So it began to be realised that this ‘dark matter’
eﬀect was a general property of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Possible ‘matter’
interpretations for this eﬀect have been numerous. Here we argue that it is simply
a failure of Newtonian gravity, a failure ‘inherited’ by General Relativity.

Newtonian gravity was based on Kepler’s Laws of motion for planets in the solar
system, which were abstracted from observational data; the most famous being that
for circular orbits the orbital speed of a planet is inversely proportional to the inverse
1/√r. This led Newton to introduce the
of the square root of the orbit radius; vO ∝
‘universal’ inverse square law of gravity, namely that the gravitational force between
two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the separation,

F =

Gm1m2
r2

,

(1)

which together with the acceleration equation F = ma, where here a = v2
O/r is the
centripetal acceleration, explained Kepler’s Laws. This led to the introduction of
the gravitational acceleration vector ﬁeld g(r) as the fundamental dynamical vari-
able for the phenomenon of gravity, and which is determined by (2), which relates
g(r) to the matter density ρ(r). Here G is Newton’s gravitational constant, the
only constant, until recent discoveries in [7] and herein, that is involved in the phe-
nomenon of gravity. Much later Hilbert and Einstein introduced a more general
theory of gravity, but which was constrained to agree with this Newtonian theory
in the appropriate limits. However while (2) for g is uniquely determined by Ke-
pler’s Laws, if we rewrite (2) in terms of a velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) then the equation for
this vector ﬁeld is not uniquely determined by Kepler’s laws: a new unique ‘space’
self-interaction dynamical term may be incorporated that does not manifest itself
in the planetary motions of the solar system. Numerous major developments then
unfold from using this in-ﬂow vector ﬁeld as the fundamental degree of freedom for
the phenomenon of gravity, foremost being that the new term has a strength deter-
mined by a dimensionless constant, a second gravitational constant. Experimental
data reveals [7] that this constant is, to within experimental error, non other than

3

≈

the ﬁne structure constant α = e2¯h/c
1/137. Then the most immediate result is
the explanation of the so called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies, though various
other gravitational anomalies, as they are known, are also now explainable. So it
turns out that the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect is not caused by a new so-far unidentiﬁed
form of matter, but is an eﬀect associated with a new feature of the phenomenon of
gravity; basically gravity is a much richer and more complex phenomenon than cur-
rently appreciated. As discussed in more detail elsewhere [8, 9] the velocity v(r, t)
ﬁeld is associated with a restructuring and eﬀective relative ‘ﬂow’ of a quantum
foam which is space; this is not a ﬂow of something through space but is a mani-
festation of a non-geometrical structure to space, with matter eﬀectively acting as
a ‘sink’ for this quantum foam. These deeper insights, which are based upon an
information-theoretic modeling of reality, are discussed at length in [8, 9]; here we
mainly concentrate on various experimentally observable and observed gravitational
phenomena emerging from this new theory of gravity. As well we show that this
theory is in agreement with various phenomena of gravity, such as precessing or-
bits, gravitational lensing etc, which were believed to have suggested that General
Relativity was a viable theory of gravity. We show here, of course, that the new dy-
namics involving the ﬁne structure constant is not contained in General Relativity.
It is asserted here that the failure of both the Newtonian theory and General Rel-
ativity to account for the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, and other gravitational phenomena
discussed herein, represents a fatal ﬂaw for both these theories; and that Newton’s
‘universal’ inverse square law (1) is not at all ‘universal’; it is in fact very restricted
in its applicability.

Herein the connection of the new theory of gravity to both the Newtonian theory
and to General Relativity is analysed, but the most signiﬁcant results relate to an
analysis of the various phenomena that only this new theory now explains, including
the borehole g anomaly eﬀect, the diﬃculties over the last 60 years in ongoing at-
tempts to increase the accuracy with which G could be measured in Cavendish-type
experiments, which are all manifestations of the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, but which is,
as explained here, most evident in the rotation velocity curves of spiral galaxies [7].
This new theory introduces a new form of quantum-foam black hole, the properties
of which are determined by the ﬁne structure constant, and which have either ‘mini-
mal’ of ‘non-minimal’ forms. The ‘minimal’ black holes are mandated by the in-ﬂow
into matter, and occur in all forms of matter. In the case of the globular clusters
the eﬀective mass of the ‘minimal’ central black holes are computable and found to
be in agreement with recent observations. The ‘non-minimal’ black holes are not
caused by matter and appear to be primordial, namely residual eﬀects of the big
bang. They have a non-inverse square law acceleration ﬁeld, and are the cause of
both the rapid formation of galaxies and of the non-Keplerian rotation dynamics of
spiral galaxies. They have an eﬀective ‘dark matter’ density that falls oﬀ as almost
the inverse of the square of the distance form the black hole, as is indeed observed.
The presence of the minimal black holes in stars aﬀects their internal central dy-

4

namics, but the eﬀect of this upon the solar neutrino ﬂux problem has yet to be
studied.

As already discussed elsewhere [10, 11, 12] the quantum-foam ‘in-ﬂow’ past the
earth towards the sun has already been shown to be present in the data from the
Miller interferometer experiment of 1925/1926. That experiment and others have
also revealed the existence of gravitational waves, essentially a ﬂow turbulence,
predicted by the new theory of gravity, but which are very unlike those predicted,
but so far unobserved, by General Relativity.

The new theory also has a ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect which is being tested by the
Gravity B Probe. This eﬀect is caused by vorticity in the in-ﬂow. As well the
new theory has quantum-foam vortex ﬁlaments linking, in particular, galactic black
holes, and these manifest, via weak gravitational lensing, as the recently observed
‘dark matter’ networks.

To avoid possible confusion it is important to understand that the special rel-
ativity eﬀects, such as length contractions, time dilations and mass increases, are
very much a part of the new gravity theory, but that it is the Lorentz interpretation
of these eﬀects, namely that these eﬀects are real dynamical eﬀects, that is being in-
dicated by experiment and observation to be the correct interpretation, and not the
usual non-dynamical spacetime interpretation of these eﬀects. In the same vein it
is the failure of the Newtonian theory of gravity that is fatal for General Relativity,
and not its connection to these so-called special relativity eﬀects. Finally, while the
‘ﬂow equations’ are classical equations, the occurrence of α strongly suggests, and
as predicted in [8, 9], that this is a manifestation of a quantum-foam substructure
to space, and that we have the ﬁrst experimental evidence of a quantum theory of
gravity. As discussed here this leads to relatively easy Cavendish-type laboratory
experiments that can explore the α-dependent aspects of gravity - essentially lab-
oratory quantum-gravity experiments. This quantum-foam substructure to space
also indicates an explanation of a diﬀerent eﬀect to that of ‘dark matter’, namely
the so-called ‘dark energy’ eﬀect, as discussed in [8].

2 Gravity as Inhomogeneous Quantum Foam In-Flow

Here we show that the Newtonian theory of gravity may be exactly re-written as
a ‘ﬂuid ﬂow’ system, as can General Relativity for a class of metrics. This ‘ﬂuid’
system is interpreted [8, 9] as a classical description of a quantum foam substructure
to space, and the ‘ﬂow’ describes the relative motion of this quantum foam with,
as we now show, gravity arising from inhomogeneities in that ﬂow. These inho-
mogeneities can be caused by an in-ﬂow into matter, or even as inhomogeneities
produced purely by the self-interaction of space itself, as happens for instance for
the black holes. The Newtonian theory was originally formulated in terms of a
force ﬁeld, the gravitational acceleration g(r, t), which is determined by the matter

For zero-vorticity (irrotational) ﬂow ω =

which has given rise to the total derivative of v familiar from ﬂuid mechanics. This
equation is then to be accompanied by the ‘Newtonian equation’ for the ﬂow ﬁeld

This exhibits the ﬂuid ﬂow form of Newtonian gravity in the case of zero vorticity
v = 0. For zero vorticity (8) determines both the magnitude and direction of
∇ ×
the velocity ﬁeld, for in this case we can write v =
u, where u(r, t) is a scalar
velocity potential, and in terms of u(r, t) (8) speciﬁes uniquely the time evolution
of u(r, t). Note that (6) and (8) are exactly equivalent to (2) for the acceleration
ﬁeld g, and so within the ﬂuid ﬂow formalism (6) and (8) are together equivalent
to the Universal Inverse Square Law for g, and so both are equally valid as regards
the numerous experimental and observational checks of the acceleration ﬁeld g for-
malism, particularly the Keplerian rotation velocity law. So we appear to have two
equivalent formalisms for the same phenomenon. Indeed for a stationary spherically

satisﬁes (8) and reproduces the inverse square law form for g using (6):

So the immediate questions that arise are (i) can the two formalisms be dis-
tinguished experimentally, and (ii) can the velocity ﬁeld formalism be generalised,
leading to new gravitational phenomena? To answer these questions we note that

(10)

1. The velocity ﬂow ﬁeld of some 430km/s in the direction (Right Ascension
= 5.2hr, Declination=
670) has been detected in several experiments, as
described in considerable detail in [8, 11, 12]. The major component of that
ﬂow is related to a galactic ﬂow, presumably within the Milky Way and the
local galactic cluster, but a smaller component of some 50km/s being the ﬂow
past the earth towards the sun has also recently been revealed in the data.

−

2. In terms of the velocity ﬁeld formalism (8) a unique term may be added
that does not aﬀect observations within the solar system, such as encoded
in Kepler’s laws, but outside of that special case the new term causes eﬀects
which vary from small to extremely large. This term will be shown herein to
cause those eﬀects that have been mistakenly called the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect.

3. Eqn.(8) and its generalisations have time-dependent solutions even when the
matter density is not time-dependent. These are a form of ﬂow turbulence,
a gravitational wave eﬀect, and they have also been detected, as discussed in
[8, 11, 12].

4. The need for a further generalisation of the ﬂow equations will be argued for,
and this in particular includes ﬂow vorticity that leads to a non-spacetime
explanation of the ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect, and of the ‘dark matter’ network
observed using the weak gravitational lensing technique.

First let us consider the arguments that lead to a generalisation of (8). The

simplest generalisation is

where

(13)

is the symmetric part of the rate of strain tensor ∂vi/∂xj , and α is a dimensionless
constant - a new gravitational constant in addition to G.
It is possible to check
that for the in-ﬂow in (9) C(v) = 0. This is a feature that uniquely determines the
form of C(v). This means that eﬀects caused by this new term are not manifest
in the planetary motions that formed the basis of Kepler’s phenomenological laws
and that then lead to Newton’s theory of gravity. As we shall see the value of
α determined from experimental data is found to be the ﬁne structure constant,
to within experimental error. As well, as discussed in Sect.5 and extensively after
that, (11) predicts precisely the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, with the eﬀective
‘dark matter’ density deﬁned by

ρDM (r) =

α
32πG

((trD)2

tr(D2)).

−

(14)

So the explanation of the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect becomes apparent once we use the
velocity ﬁeld formulation of gravity. However (11) must be further generalised to
include (i) the velocity of absolute motion of the matter components with respect
to the local quantum foam system, and (ii) vorticity eﬀects.

For these further generalisations we need to be precise by what is meant by
the velocity ﬁeld v(r, t). To be speciﬁc and also to deﬁne a possible measurement
procedure we can choose to use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frame of
reference for that purpose, as this is itself easy to establish. However that does not
imply that the CMB frame is the local ‘quantum-foam’ rest frame. Relative to the
CMB frame and using the local absolute motion detection techniques described in
[8, 11, 12], or more modern techniques that are under development, v(r, t) may be
measured in the neighbourhood of the observer. Then an ‘object’ at location r0(t)
in the CMB frame has velocity v0(t) = dr0(t)/dt with respect to that frame. We
then deﬁne

vR(r0(t), t) = v0(t)

v(r0(t), t),

−

(15)

as the velocity of the object relative to the quantum foam at the location of the
object. However this absolute velocity of matter vR(t) does not appear in (11),
and so not only is that equation lacking vorticity eﬀects, it presumably is only
an approximation for when the matter has a negligible speed of absolute motion
with respect to the local quantum foam. To introduce the vector vR(t) we need to
construct a 2nd-rank tensor generalisation of (11), and the simplest form is

structure we can now include the direction of absolute motion of the matter density
with respect to the quantum foam, with the scale of that given by c, which is
the speed of light relative to the quantum foam. The superscript notation for the
components of vR(t) is for convenience only, and has no other signiﬁcance. The

which is the Biot-Savart form for the vorticity, with the additional term being the
homogeneous solution. Then (19) becomes an integro-diﬀerential equation for the
velocity ﬁeld, with ψ determined by self-consistency. As we shall see in Sect.7 (25)
explains the so-called ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect in terms of this vorticity in the in-ﬂow.
Of course (19) and (25) only make sense if vR(r, t) for the matter at location r is
speciﬁed. We now consider the special case where the matter is subject only to the
eﬀects of motion with respect to the quantum-foam velocity-ﬁeld inhomogeneities
and variations in time, which causes a ‘gravitational’ acceleration.

We also not that (19) and (20) need to be further generalised to take account
of the cosmological-scale eﬀects, namely that the spatial system is compact and

3 Geodesics

Process Physics [8] leads to the Lorentzian interpretation of so called ‘relativistic
eﬀects’. This means that the speed of light is only ‘c’ with respect to the quantum-
foam system, and that time dilation eﬀects for clocks and length contraction eﬀects
for rods are caused by the motion of clocks and rods relative to the quantum foam. So
these eﬀects are real dynamical eﬀects caused by motion through the quantum foam,
and are not to be interpreted as non-dynamical spacetime eﬀects as suggested by
Einstein. To arrive at the dynamical description of the various eﬀects of the quantum
foam we shall introduce conjectures that essentially lead to a phenomenological
description of these eﬀects. In the future we expect to be able to derive this dynamics
directly from the Quantum Homotopic Field Theory (QHFT) that describes the
quantum foam system [8]. Here we shall conjecture that the path of an object
through an inhomogeneous and time-varying quantum-foam is determined, at a
classical level, by a variational principle, namely that the travel time is extremised
for the physical path r0(t). The travel time is deﬁned by

which agrees with the ﬂuid ﬂow form suggested in (6) for zero vorticity (

(25) and the gravitational dynamics for the matter in (29) now form a closed system.
This system of equations is a considerable generalisation from that of Newtonian
gravity, and would appear to be very diﬀerent from the curved spacetime formalism
of General Relativity. However we now show that General Relativity leads to a very
similar system of equations, but with one important exception, namely that the
‘dark matter’ ‘quantum-foam’ dynamics is missing from the Hilbert-Einstein theory
of gravity.

The above may be modiﬁed when the ‘object’ is a massless photon, and the
corresponding result leads to the gravitational lensing eﬀect. But not only will
ordinary matter produce such lensing, but the eﬀective ‘dark matter’ density will also
do so, and that is relevant to the recent observation by the weak lensing technique
of the so-called ‘dark matter’ networks, in Sect.19.

4 General Relativity and the In-Flow Process

Eqn.(26) involves various absolute quantities such as the absolute velocity of an
object relative to the quantum foam and the absolute speed c also relative to the
foam, and of course absolute velocities are excluded from the General Relativity
(GR) formalism. However (26) gives (with t = x0

which is the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν [13, 14] for GR. We emphasize
that the absolute velocity vR has been measured, and so the foundations of GR as
usually stated are invalid. Here we look closely at the GR formalism when the
metric has the form in (35), appropriate to a velocity ﬁeld formulation of gravity.
In GR the metric tensor gµν (x), specifying the geometry of the spacetime construct,
is determined by

where Gµν is the Einstein tensor, Tµν is the energy-momentum tensor, Rµν = Rα
and R = gµν Rµν and gµν is the matrix inverse of gµν . The curvature tensor is

This solution is the basis of various experimental checks of General Relativity in
which the spherically symmetric mass is either the sun or the earth. The four tests
are: the gravitational redshift, the bending of light, the precession of the perihelion
of Mercury, and the time delay of radar signals.

However the solution (41) is in fact completely equivalent to the in-ﬂow interpre-

which is exactly the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν [13, 14] in (35) with
the velocity ﬁeld given exactly by the Newtonian form in (9). In which case the
geodesic equation (39) of test objects in the Schwarzschild metric is equivalent to
solving (31). This choice of coordinates corresponds to a particular frame of reference
in which the test object has velocity vR = v
v0 relative to the in-ﬂow ﬁeld v, as
seen in (26). This results shows that the Schwarzschild metric in GR is completely
equivalent to Newton’s inverse square law: GR in this case is nothing more than
Newtonian gravity in disguise. So the so-called ‘tests’ of GR were nothing more
than a test of the geodesic equation, where most simply this is seen to determine
the motion of an object relative to an absolute local frame of reference - the quantum
foam frame.

−

It is conventional wisdom for practitioners in General Relativity to regard the
choice of coordinates or frame of reference to be entirely arbitrary and having no
physical signiﬁcance: no observations should be possible that can detect and mea-
sure vR. This ‘wisdom’ is based on two beliefs (i) that all attempts to detect vR,
namely the detection of absolute motion, have failed, and that (ii) the existence of
absolute motion is incompatible with the many successes of both the Special The-
ory of Relativity and of the General Theory of Relativity. Both of these beliefs are
demonstrably false, see [8, 10].

The results in this section suggest, just as for Newtonian gravity, that the Ein-
stein General Relativity is nothing more than the dynamical equations for a velocity
ﬂow ﬁeld v(r, t). Hence the non-ﬂat spacetime construct appears to be merely an
unnecessary artifact of the Einstein measurement protocol, which in turn was moti-
vated by the mis-reporting of the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment [8, 12].
The putative successes of General Relativity should thus be considered as an insight
into the ﬂuid ﬂow dynamics of the quantum foam system, rather than any conﬁrma-
tion of the validity of the spacetime formalism, and it was this insight that in [8, 10]
led, in part, to the ﬂow dynamics in (19) and (20). Let us therefore substitute the
metric

dτ 2 = gµν dxµdxν = dt2

v(r(t), t)dt)2,

(44)

−
into (36) using (38) and (37). This metric involves the arbitrary time-dependent
velocity ﬁeld v(r, t). The various components of the Einstein tensor are then found

(46)

In vacuum, with Tµν = 0, we ﬁnd from (36) and (45) that Gµν = 0 implies that
Gµν = 0. This system of equations is thus very similar to the in-ﬂow dynamics
in (19) and (20), except that in vacuum GR, for the Panlev´e-Gullstrand metric,
demands that

((trD)2

tr(D2)) = 0.

−

(47)

This simply corresponds to the fact that GR does not permit the ‘dark matter’
eﬀect, namely that ρDM = 0, according to (14), and this happens because GR was
forced to agree with Newtonian gravity, in the appropriate limits, and that theory
also has no such eﬀect. As well in GR the energy-momentum tensor Tµν is not
permitted to make any reference to absolute linear motion of the matter; only the
relative motion of matter or absolute rotational motion is permitted.

It is very signiﬁcant to note that the above exposition of the GR formalism for
the Panlev´e-Gullstrand metric is exact. Then taking the trace of the
Gij equation
in (46) we obtain, also exactly, and again using the identity in (17), and in the case
of zero vorticity, and outside of matter so that Tµν = 0,

which is the Newtonian ‘velocity ﬁeld’ formulation of Newtonian gravity outside of
matter. This should have been expected as it corresponds to the previous obser-
vation that ‘Newtonian in-ﬂow’ velocity ﬁeld is exactly equivalent to the external
Schwarzschild metric. So again we see the extreme paucity of new physics in the
GR formalism: all the key tests of GR are now seen to amount to a test only of
δτ [x]/δxµ = 0, when the in-ﬂow ﬁeld is given by (46), and which is nothing more
than Newtonian gravity. Of course Newtonian gravity was itself merely based upon
observations within the solar system, and this was too special to have revealed key
aspects of gravity. Hence, despite popular opinion, the GR formalism is based upon
very poor evidence. Indeed there is only one deﬁnitive conﬁrmation of the GR for-
malism apart from the misleading external-Schwarzschild metric cases, namely the
observed decay of the binary pulsar orbital motion, for only in this case is the met-
ric non-Schwarzschild, and therefore non-Newtonian. However the new theory of

15

gravity also leads to the decay of orbits, and on the grounds of dimensional analysis
we would expect comparable predictions. So GR is not unique in predicting orbital
decay.

5 The ‘Dark Matter’ Eﬀect

We now make more explicit the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect in a form that will be extensively
analysed in the following sections. Restricting the ﬂow dynamics to that of a matter
system approximately at rest with respect to the quantum foam system, and also
neglecting vorticity eﬀects, (19) and (20) simplify to (11), with the key C(v) term
deﬁned in (12). In this case we have

∂v

g =

+ (v.

and then (11) gives

after writing the new term as C(v) = 4πGρDM , with

C(v) =

ρDM (r) =

So we see that ρDM would act as an eﬀective matter density, and it is demonstrated
later that it is the consequences of this term which have been misinterpreted as ‘dark
matter’. Note however ρDM is not positive deﬁnite. We see that this eﬀect is actually
the consequence of quantum foam eﬀects within the new proposed dynamics for
v = 0
gravity, and which becomes apparent particularly in spiral galaxies. With
we can write v =

u, and (11) has the form

Hence the Φ ﬁeld acts as the source term for the velocity potential. Note that in

This non-linear equation clearly cannot be solved for v(r) as its direction is not
speciﬁed. This form makes it clear that we should expect gravitational waves, but
certainly not waves travelling at the speed of light as c does not appear in (53).
Note that (53) involves ‘action-at-a-distance’ eﬀects, as there is no time-delay in
the denominators. This was a feature of Newton’s original theory of gravity. Here
it is understood to be caused by the underlying quantum-foam dynamics (QHFT)
which reaches this classical ‘ﬂow’ description by ongoing non-local and instantaneous
wavefunctional collapses, as discussed in [8]. Contrary to popular belief even GR
has this ‘action-at-a-distance’ feature, as the reformulation of GR via the Panlev´e-
Gullstrand metric leads also to an equation of the form in (52), but with the C(v)
term absent.

6 Gravitational Waves

Newtonian gravity in its original ‘force’ formalism (2) does not admit any wave phe-
nomena. However the completely equivalent ‘in-ﬂow’ formalism in (6) and (8) does
admit wave phenomena. For the simpler case of zero vorticity, and so permitting
the velocity potential description, and also neglecting the ‘dark matter’ term C(v),
then (53) becomes

which together reproduce (3), even when the ﬂow is time-dependent. Suppose that
(56) has for a static matter density a static solution u0(r) with corresponding ve-
locity ﬁeld v0(r), and with corresponding acceleration g0(r). Then we look for time
dependent perturbative solutions of (56) with u = u0 + u. To ﬁrst order in u we
then have

∂u(r, t)
∂t

u0(r).

This equation then has wave solutions of the form u(r, t) = A cos(k.r
ωt) where
ω(k, r) = v0(r).k, for wavelengths short compared to the scale of changes in v0(r).
The phase velocity of these waves is then vφ = v0, and the group velocity is vg =
∇kω = v0. Then the velocity ﬁeld is
v(r, t) = v0(r)

Ak sin(k.r

w(k, r)t).

(59)

(56)

(57)

(58)

But are these wave solutions physical, or are they a mere artifact of the in-
ﬂow formalism? First note that the wave phenomena do not cause any gravitational
eﬀects, because the acceleration ﬁeld is independent of their existence; whether they
are present or not does not aﬀect g(r). This question is equivalent to asking which of
the ﬁelds v or g is the fundamental quantity. As we have already noted the velocity
ﬁeld v and these wave phenomena have already been observed [8, 11, 12]. Indeed it
is even possible that the eﬀects of such waves are present in the Michelson-Morley
1887 fringe shift data. This would imply that the real gravitational waves have
actually been observed for over 100 years.

Within the new theory of gravity these waves do aﬀect the acceleration ﬁeld g,
via the new C(v) term. Numerical studies have shown these wave eﬀects, and that
even when the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect is retained this wave phenomena persists. The
observational evidence is that these gravitational waves are apparently present in
the Milky Way and local galactic cluster, as revealed in the analysis of data from at
least three distinct observations of absolute motion eﬀects [12].

7 Frame-Dragging Eﬀect as an In-Flow Vorticity Eﬀect

Here we brieﬂy note that (25) and the vorticity dependent term in (32) together
explain the frame-dragging eﬀect. For the case where vR is determined solely by
the rotation of the earth (25) gives, outside of the earth, the dipole form

ω(r) =

where L is the angular momentum of the earth, and r is the distance from the centre
of the earth. Here spherical symmetry of the earth is assumed. When used in (32)
vR term where here vR is used
the precession of a spinning sphere, caused by the ω
to describe the rotation of the sphere, may be used to detect the vorticity in (60), as
in the Gravity B Probe. This eﬀect has always caused interpretational problems in
General Relativity: what system is it that acts as a frame of reference in deﬁning the
rotation of the earth? Answers usually invoked some Machian explanation, namely
that the rotation was deﬁned relative to the universe as a whole. In the velocity-ﬁeld
formalism for gravity the rotation is relative to the local quantum-foam substratum,
and the rotation of the earth is aﬀecting the in-ﬂow component to the extent that
it slightly drags the in-ﬂow, that is, it imparts some of its rotation to the in-ﬂow,
In GR the vorticity ﬁeld ω is known as the
as described by the above vorticity.
‘gravitomagnetic’ ﬁeld, because of its role in the Lorentz-like velocity-dependent
acceleration in (32). The expression for the vorticity in (25) would also appear to
have contributions from the absolute linear motion of the earth. Such an eﬀect can
be tested by the Gravity B Probe as the test-sphere spin-precession would then be
diﬀerent in both magnitude and direction.

8 Gravitational Anomalies

There are numerous gravitational anomalies, including not only the spiral-galaxy
‘dark matter’ eﬀect and problems in measuring G, but as well there are others that
are not well-known in physics, presumably because their existence is incompatible
with the Newtonian or the Hilbert-Einstein gravity theories.

The most signiﬁcant of these anomalies is the Allais eﬀect [15]. In the 1950’s
Allais conducted a long series of experiments using a paraconical pendulum, which
can be thought of as a Foucault pendulum with a short arm length and a special
pivot mechanism. These observations revealed pendulum precession eﬀects that are
distinct from the Foucault pendulum precession, which mainly manifests in the case
of a very long pendulum, associated with the position of the moon, but with a
magnitude very much larger than the well-known tidal eﬀects. However in June
1954 Allais reported that the paraconical pendulum exhibited peculiar movements
at the time of a solar eclipse. Allais was recording the precession of the pendulum
in Paris. Coincidentally during the 30 day observation period a partial solar eclipse
occurred at Paris on June 30. During the eclipse the precession of the pendulum
was seen to be disturbed. Similar results were obtained during another solar eclipse
on October 29 1959. There have been other repeats of the Allais experiment with
varying results.

Another anomaly was reported by Saxl and Allen [16] during the solar eclipse
of March 7 1970. Signiﬁcant variations in the period of a torsional pendulum were
observed both during the eclipse and as well in the hours just preceding and just
following the eclipse. The eﬀects seem to suggest that an “apparent wavelike struc-
ture has been observed over the course of many years at our Harvard laboratory”,
where the wavelike structure is present and reproducible even in the absence of an
eclipse.

Again Zhou and Huang [17] report various clock anomalies occurring during the
solar eclipses of September 23 1987, March 18 1988 and July 22 1990 observed using
atomic clocks.

Another anomaly is of course the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect associated with the rota-
tional velocities of objects in spiral galaxies. This anomaly led to the introduction
of the ‘dark matter’ concept - but with no such matter ever having been detected,
despite extensive searches. This anomaly was compounded when recently obser-
vations of the rotational velocities of objects within elliptical galaxies was seen to
require very little ‘dark matter’. Of course this is a simple consequence of the new
theory of gravity, as we shall see.

All these anomalies, including the g anomaly in Sect.9 and others such as the
the solar neutrino ﬂux deﬁciency problem were clearly indicating that gravity has
aspects to it that are not within the prevailing theories.

±

Stacey and others [18, 19, 20, 21] have found evidence for non-Newtonian grav-
itation from gravimetric measurements (Airy experiments) in mines and boreholes.
The discovery was that the measured value of g down mines and boreholes became
greater than that predicted by the Newtonian theory, given the density proﬁle ρ(r)
implied by sampling, and so implying a defect in Newtonian gravity, as shown in
Fig.1 for the Greenland Ice shelf borehole measurements. The results were inter-
preted and analysed using either a value of G diﬀerent to but larger than that found
in laboratory experiments or by assuming a short range Yukawa type force in addi-
tion to the Newtonian ‘inverse-square law’. Numerous experiments were carried out
in which g was measured as a function of depth, and also as a function of height
above ground level using towers. The tower experiments [23, 24] did not indicate
any non-Newtonian eﬀect, and so implied that the extra Yukawa force explanation
was not viable. The combined results appeared to have resulted in confusion and
eventually the experimental eﬀect was dismissed as being caused by erroneous den-
sity sampling. However the new theory of gravity predicts such an eﬀect, and in
particular that the eﬀect should manifest within the earth but not above it, as was
in fact observed. The eﬀect predicted is that d∆g(r)/dr should be discontinuous at

20

the boundary, as shown in Fig.1. Essentially this eﬀect is caused by the new C(v)
term in the in-ﬂow theory of gravity.

and we see that the eﬀective Newtonian gravitational constant in (67) is GN =

The result in (67), which is diﬀerent from that of the Newtonian theory (α = 0) has

which is the form actually observed [18, 19, 22]. So outside of the spherical earth
the Newtonian theory and the in-ﬂow theory are indistinguishable, as indicated by
the horizontal line, for r > R, in Fig.1. However inside the earth the two theories
give a diﬀerent dependence on r, due to the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect within the earth.

Gravity residuals from a borehole into the Greenland Ice Cap were determined
down to a depth of 1.5km [22]. The ice had a density of ρ(R) = 930 kg/m3, and
10−11 m3s−2kg−1, we obtain from a linear ﬁt to the
from (71), using GN = 6.6742
slope of the data points in Fig.1 that α−1 = 139
5, which equals the value of the
ﬁne structure constant α−1 = 137.036 to within the errors, and for this reason we
identify the α constant in (11) as being the ﬁne structure constant.

The so called ﬁne structure constant α was introduced into physics by Sommer-
feld in 1916. Sommerfeld extended the Bohr theory of atoms to include elliptical
orbits and the relativistic dependence of mass on speed. The result for a typical
energy diﬀerence is

We see that the leading term contains α2, as well as the second term which introduces
another α2. It is because of its presence in this second order term that α is called
the ﬁne structure constant, though that is really a misnomer, for α determines also
the Bohr energies, as is seen once we compare the atomic energy levels with the rest
mass energy of the electron, as in (72). The occurence of α in the self-interaction
dynamics of space implies that the stochastic processing in the information-theoretic
process physics, see [8], involves a probability measure that not only manifests in

22

this spatial dynamics but also manifests in Quantum Electrodynamics, where there
α is a measure of the probablity for a charged particle to emit or absorb a photon.
Clearly we are seeing evidence of a deep uniﬁcation of fundamental physics.

10 Measurements of G and the Fine Structure

Constant

As already noted Newton’s Inverse Square Law of Gravitation may only be strictly
valid in special cases. The theory that gravitational eﬀects arise from inhomo-
geneities in the quantum foam ﬂow implies that there is no ‘universal law of grav-
itation’ because the inhomogeneities are determined by non-linear ‘ﬂuid equations’
and the solutions have no form which could be described by a ‘universal law’. Fun-
damentally there is no generic ﬂuid ﬂow behaviour. The Inverse Square Law is then
only an approximation, with large deviations seen in the case of spiral galaxies. Nev-
ertheless Newton’s gravitational constant G will have a deﬁnite value as it quantiﬁes
the eﬀective rate at which matter dissipates the information content of space.

From these considerations it follows that the measurement of the value of G
will be diﬃcult as the measurement of the forces between two of more objects,
which is the usual method of measuring G, will depend on the geometry of the
spatial positioning of these objects in a way not previously accounted for because
the Newtonian Inverse Square Law has always been assumed, or in some case a
speciﬁed change in the form of the law has been used. But in all cases a ‘law’ has
been assumed, and this may have been the ﬂaw in the analysis of data from such
experiments. This implies that the value of G from such experiments will show some
variability as a systematic eﬀect has been neglected in analysing the experimental
data. So experimental measurements of G should show an unexpected contextuality.
As well the inﬂuence of surrounding matter has also not been properly accounted
for. Of course any eﬀects of turbulence in the inhomogeneities of the ﬂow has
presumably also never even been contemplated. The ﬁrst measurement of G was
in 1798 by Cavendish using a torsional balance. As the precision of experiments
increased over the years and a variety of techniques used the disparity between
the values of G has actually increased [49]. Fig.2 shows the results from precision
measurements of G over the last 60 years. As can be seen one indication of the
contextuality is that measurements of G produce values that diﬀer by nearly 40
times their individual error estimates. In 1998 CODATA increased the uncertainty
in G, shown by the dotted line in 2, from 0.013% to 0.15%.

Note that the relative spread ∆GN /GN ≈

O(α), as we would now expect. Es-
sentially the diﬀerent Cavendish-type laboratory experiments used diﬀerent matter
geometries and, as we have seen, the geometry of the masses has an eﬀect on the in-
ﬂow, and so on the measured force between the masses. Only for the borehole-type
experiments do we have a complete analytic analysis, in Sect.9, and an ocean mea-
10−11
surement is of that type, and experiment [25] gives a GN = (6.677

ometry of the masses. A re-analysis of the data in Fig.2 using the in-ﬂow theory is
predicted to resolve these apparent discrepancies. Examples of how the quantum-
foam ﬂuid-ﬂow theory of gravity alters the analysis of data from Cavendish-type
experiments are given in Sect.21, and in general the ‘dark matter’ eﬀects are of

11 Gravitational Attractors - New Black Holes

Here we consider a new phenomena which is not in either the Newtonian or Ein-
steinian theories of gravity, namely the existence of gravitational attractors. Such
an attractor may exist by itself or it may be accompanied by matter, as in the case
of planets, stars, globular clusters and galaxies, both elliptical and spiral. As we
have seen in Sect.9 the existence of such an attractor at the centre of the earth
is suggested by the borehole g anomaly data. Here we develop the general theory
of these attractors. Indeed they are apparently a common occurrence. Up to now
the eﬀects of these ‘attractors’ in globular clusters, quasistellar objects (QSO) and
galaxies have been interpreted by astronomers as general relativity ‘black holes’,
but only by default as no other phenomenon was until now known which could ac-
count for the strong gravitational eﬀects observed at the centres of these systems.
These attractors are self-sustaining quantum foam in-ﬂows, and their behaviour is
determined solely by the ﬁne structure constant: they are quantum foam in-ﬂow
singularities where the quantum-foam is destroyed, together with any matter that
happnes to in-fall. So to that extent they are classical manifestations of quantum
gravity. These attractors have an event horizon where the in-ﬂow speed reaches
the speed of light, and within this horizon the speed increases without limit to an
inﬁnite speed at a singular point. In-falling matter can produce radiation from the
heating eﬀects associated with this in-fall.

However the existence of these in-ﬂow singularities does not require that they be
formed by the collapse of matter, and they need not have matter at their centres,
so in many respects they diﬀer from the ‘black holes’ of general relativity. They
also diﬀer from these ‘black holes’ in that their gravitational acceleration g(r) is
not given by Newton’s inverse square law.
It is suggested here that along with
matter and radiation, that they formed the third component of the universe, apart
from space itself. And that they played a key role in the formation of certain
gravitationally collapsed systems, such as spiral galaxies, and that the long range

25

nature of their acceleration ﬁeld g(r) explains the apparent relatively rapid formation
of such structures in the early universe.

Here we ﬁrst consider the special case of a one-parameter class of matter-free
spherical attractors, and then the case when the attractor is associated with matter.
In this case the attractor may be minimal or non-minimal, with the distinction de-
termined by whether or not the attractor produces a long-range acceleration ﬁeld, as
for the non-minimal attractors. We also consider a class of non-spherical attractors,
but the non-sphericity produce only short range eﬀects. For the case of spherical
attractors we determine the size of the event horizon. For globular clusters we can
then predict the minimum mass of the central attractor and compare that with the
total mass of the cluster. This ratio is shown to be equal to α/2, and this prediction
is in agreement with the observations of the M15 and G1 globular clusters. Hence
the globular clusters supply a striking conﬁrmation of the new theory of gravity
and its attractors. In Sect.21 we show that these attractors may be experimentally
studied in Cavendish-style laboratory gravitational experiments, and so provide the
opportunity for the ﬁrst laboratory quantum gravity experiments and indeed labo-
ratory black hole experiments.

There will be at least a minimal attractor within the sun which can also be
detected by analysing the neutrino ﬂux and its energy spectrum, as these attractors
produce central gravitational forces very diﬀerent from the Newtonian theory, which
is an essential input into current stellar dynamics.

Spherical Gravitational Attractors

Here we reveal the one-parameter class of spherical attractors in the absence of
matter. For a spherically symmetric in-ﬂow v(r, t) the basic in-ﬂow equation (11)

later. Note that the K term does not contribute to ρDM . However the K term is
not a solution of (11) for a stationary ﬂow. The reason for this is somewhat subtle.
By direct computation we would appear to obtain that

which decreases slowly with distance, compared to Newton’s inverse square law.
Because these attractors can be independent of matter they would have arisen in
the early universe during the formation of space itself. Once matter had cooled to
the recombination temperature of about 3000oK, these attractors would have played
a key role in the formation of the ﬁrst stars and the galaxies. This attractor has a
spatial in-ﬂow with a speed singularity at r = 0. There is a spherical event horizon,
where v = c, at rH = ( β
c2 )2/α. Hence the attractor acts as a ‘black hole’, but very
much unlike the ‘black hole’ in general relativity. The universe would have had these
attractors as primordial black holes from the very beginning.

13 Minimal Attractor for a Uniform Density

Sphere

Now consider the gravitational attractors that are formed by the presence of matter.
Here the quantum foam in-ﬂow associated with the matter appears to trigger a non-
Newtonian in-ﬂow at the centre of the matter distribution. Now for a spherically
symmetric matter density and a spherically symmetric in-ﬂow v(r, t) the basic in-
ﬂow equation (11) has the form

ρ(r) = ρ, 0 < r < R; ρ(r) = 0, r > R.

where in general β and β have diﬀerent values. As well the K term is permitted in

the asymptotic or the ‘matter dependent’ solution fm(r). The complete solution is
obtained by ensuring that f (r) and f ′(r) are continuous at r = R, which is required
of the 2nd order diﬀerential equation. Let us ﬁrst consider the critical case where

(85)

(86)

Sect.9 gave rise to a minimal attractor. For such a uniform density sphere the in-
ﬂow speed v(r), matter density ρ(r) and ‘dark matter’ density ρDM (r), and the
acceleration
g(r) are plotted in the left column of Fig.3, including the special case
α = 0 which gives the Newtonian gravity results. Shown in the right hand column
of Fig.3 are the corresponding results for a spherical shell with the same total mass
M , as the sphere. In general the new theory predicts a gravitational attractor at
the centre of all matter distributions. For the case of a spherical system the eﬀective
mass of the attractor is MDM = αM/2, as measured by the external gravitational
acceleration in (92). Note that for the minimal attractor the in-ﬂow is uniquely
determined by the matter density, apart of course from time-dependent behaviour.
The minimal attractor is caused by the matter induced in-ﬂow, and as such is not
the result of a primordial attractor.

14 Non-Minimal Attractor for a Uniform Density

Sphere

Now consider the more general case of a non-minimal attractor for which the non-
Newtonian acceleration ﬁeld (82) extends beyond the matter density. These attrac-
tors have a primordial origin, and would have played a critical role in the formation
of the matter system from a gas cloud. In the non-minimal case with β > 0, we

which asymptotically is dominated by the non-Newtonian second term, which essen-

In this non-minimal attractor case we have a superposition of a minimal attractor,
with its strength given by the results in Sect.13, and an independent vacuum at-
tractor with strength β. This happens because in the case of a static spherically
symmetric system the ﬂow equation is linear. Of course in a physical situation these
two components would interact because the matter density would respond to the
total gravitational acceleration. Here we have ignored this dynamical eﬀect.

One important consequence of this form for g(r) is that asymptotically Kepler’s

Fractal Attractors

In the early universe there would have been primordial gravitational attractors of
various strengths, as deﬁned by their β values. It is unknown what spectrum of β
values would have occurred. These would initially have all been devoid of matter
agglomerations, that is they would be ‘bare’ attractors, because of the high temper-
atures. Each such attractor represents an in-ﬂow of space which would have been
in competition with the overall growth of space, as described previously. Each such
attractor would have a region of inﬂuence, beyond which its ﬂow ﬁeld and conse-
quently its gravitational ﬁeld would be cancelled by that of other attractors. That
is, the in-ﬂow would be conﬁned to that region. Clearly attractors with larger β
values would have larger regions of inﬂuence. Hence space would be demarcated into
a cellular form. However within each such cellular region there would be smaller at-
tractors, and within their regions, further smaller attractors. We would then expect
a fractal cellular structure: cells within cells and so on. This form is predicted by the
emergent geometry of the gebit structure, as discussed in [8, 9], and so we appear
to be seeing the linking of the bottom-up approach, from the information-theoretic
ideas, with the top-down phenomenological description of space and gravity, that
has arisen from generalising the ﬂow formalism of both Newtonian gravity and Gen-
eral Relativity. This fractal cellular structure is consistent with the in-ﬂow equation.
Each cell would respond gravitationally to the gravitational ﬁeld of the cell in which
it is eﬀectively embedded. Presumably attractors can merge, though this has not
been analysed so far. Over time one would then expect that extremely strong and
spatially extended attractors would arise. As the universe cooled and the plasma
recombined to form a neutral gas, that gas would have been rapidly attracted by
the long range gravitational ﬁelds. Detailed studies of the dynamics of this system
of fractal attractors is required, as it is this system that determined the matter dis-
tribution of the universe, though as well we need to take account of possible vortex
systems, as discussed later.

17 Globular Cluster Black Holes

Figure 4: Globular cluster M15 in the constellation Pegasus, about 40,000 light years away,
contains some 30,000 stars. M15 is one of some 150 known globular clusters that form a
halo surrounding the Milky Way. The core is tightly packed. The new theory of gravity
implies that this and other clusters have a minimal attractor, a black hole, at the centre of
mass MDM = α

2 M .

Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope announced [50, 51] that they
had discovered evidence for intermediate mass black holes (IMBH), with masses
from 100 to tens of thousands of solar masses. They believed that they had already
established the existence of stellar black holes with masses from a few to ten solar
masses. Stellar black holes were believed to be formed by the collapse of the cores of
giant stars. But two of the Milky Way globular clusters, M15 and G1, suggested the
existence of medium sized black holes. M15, shown in Fig.4, is in the constellation
Pegasus, while G1 is near the Andromeda Galaxy. These clusters are some of the
nearly 150 known globular clusters that form a halo surrounding the Milky Way.
It is believed that the rising density of stars towards the centre had resulted in a
collapse of the core, leaving an IMBH. Using the motion of stars within the clusters
the mass of the cluster and of the ‘black hole’ were determined. In General Relativity
the mass of such a black hole would depend on how many stars had been drawn into

Figure 5: Assuming a matter density proﬁle falling oﬀ like 1/(r2 + b2)2, appropriate for a

in the plot. The diﬀerence becomes very large for small r, but this is not shown in the
plot. The matter density and the eﬀective ‘dark matter’ density are shown in the middle
plot. The lower plot shows the gravitational acceleration, with the strong peak at r = 0

MDM = αM/2 to good accuracy. A non-minimal attractor would give even larger eﬀects
near r = 0.

the black hole, and that is not predictable without generating some scenario for the
dynamical history of the globular cluster. However in the new theory of gravity we
must have at least a minimal gravitational attractor, whose mass is computable, and
is given to suﬃcient accuracy by the perturbative result. So the globular clusters
M15 and G1 give an excellent opportunity to test the presence of the attractor and
its eﬀective mass.

Numerical solutions of (61) for a typical cluster density proﬁle are shown in Fig.5
and revealed that indeed the central ‘dark matter’ attractor has a mass accurately
given by the perturbative result MDM /M = α/2 = 0.00365. For M15 the mass of
the central ‘black hole’ was found to be [50] MDM = 1.7+2.7
103M⊙, and the total
105M⊙. Then these results together give
mass of M15 was determined [52] to be 4.9
MDM /M = 0.0035+0.011
−0.0035 which is in excellent agreement with the above prediction.
For G1 we have [51] MDM = 2.0+1.4
106M⊙. These
104M⊙, and M = (7

values give MM D/M = 0.0006
0.0049, which is also consistent with the above α/2
prediction.

However there is one complication in this analysis. The determination of the
‘black hole’ mass followed from stochastic modelling of the motion of the inner
stars, which was compared with the motion of those stars as revealed by the HST. In
that modelling the gravitational acceleration caused by the ‘black hole’ would have
1/r2. However the
been described by Newton’s inverse square law form: g(r)
∼
1/r1+α/2. Hence
attractor produces a gravitational acceleration of the form: g(r)
to test the attractor explanation it is necessary for the stochastic modelling to be
repeated using this modiﬁed force law. Nevertheless that the attractor explanation
gives masses consistent with the observations and modelling is very encouraging.
The attractor explanation is independent of the dynamical history of the globular
cluster. Observations of other clusters should conﬁrm that they all have the same
mass ratio MDM /M = α/2. Of course there is an event horizon associated with the
attractor, and to that extent we can continue to describe the attractor as a ‘black
hole’, though one very diﬀerent from that of General Relativity.

18 Galactic Rotation Curves and Gravitational

Attractors

Consider the case of a spiral galaxy with a non-spherical rotating matter distribu-
tion. For spiral galaxies the new theory of gravity implies that their central black
holes are large non-minimal primordial attractors. Then the non-inverse square law
acceleration of such an attractor, in (97), would have caused a vary large in-fall
speed for the surrounding matter, unlike the Newtonian-like gravitational in-fall
which would result from the matter alone without a primordial attractor. Such a
large in-fall speed would almost certainly result in a large angular momentum for the
matter, resulting in the rotating ﬂat disk so charactersitic of spiral galaxies. Then
by the same argument we see that non-rotating elliptical galaxies are formed by a

35

gravitational in-fall mechanism that does not have a central primordial black hole,
or at least only a very small one. Hence elliptical galaxies should not display the
extreme ‘dark matter’ eﬀect that follows from the presence of a central non-minimal
attractor, as is apparent now from a recent analysis of elliptical galaxies [53]. As well
the region of inﬂuence of a primordial attractor will determine the total amount of
matter that it can attract to form a spiral galaxy, and so there will be a relationship
between the total ‘dark matter’ content of a spiral galaxy and its luminosity. On the
other hand for elliptical galaxies the central attractors are simply a consequence of
the matter induced in-ﬂow, resulting in a minimal attractor, so their central black
hole mass should be related to their total matter content by the same relationship
as for the globular clusters, with some correction for their non-sphericity, which in
general also permits more than one such black hole.

For the case of spiral galaxies we need to use numerical techniques, but beyond
a suﬃciently large distance the in-ﬂow, due then mainly to the primordial attractor,
will have spherical symmetry, and in that region we may use (61) and (62) with
ρ(r) = 0. Then as already analysed the in-ﬂow has the form, on re-parametrising
(96),

v(r) = K 

where K and RS are arbitrary constants in the ρ = 0 region, but where the value
of K is determined by matching to the solution in the matter region. Here RS
characterises the length scale of the non-perturbative non-minimal attractor part of
this expression, and K depends on α and G and details of the matter distribution.
The galactic circular orbital velocities of stars etc may be used to observe this
process in a spiral galaxy and from (49) and (101) we obtain a replacement for the
Newtonian ‘inverse square law’,

in the asymptotic limit. From (102) the centripetal acceleration relation vO(r) =

rg(r) gives a ‘universal rotation curve’

Because of the α dependent part this rotation-velocity curve falls oﬀ extremely
slowly with r, as is indeed observed for spiral galaxies. Of course it was the inability
of the Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity theories to explain these observations that

the in-ﬂow theory, as follows from (55). The form in (103) with α = 1/137 ﬁts,
for example, the high luminosity URC, for a suitable value of RS, which depends
on the luminosity, as shown by one example in Fig.7. For low luminosity data the
observations do not appear to extend far enough to reveal the asymptotic form of
the rotation curve, predicted by (103).

As already noted in (95) the eﬀective ‘dark matter’ density for these non-minimal
attractors falls oﬀ, essentially, like 1/r2, as astronomers had deduced from observa-
tions of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. This leads to the following expression

vations that the total amount of ‘dark matter’ exceeds the real amount of matter,
as revealed by its luminosity, by often an order of magnitude.

Although no analytic solutions are known, numerical studies reveal that this

singularity, and so these vortices provide a possible explanation for the so-called
‘dark matter’ networks which have been detected using weak gravitational lensing
[57, 58], for the ‘dark-matter’ density associated with these vortices lenses light, via
the geodesic equation, as if there were real matter present. At the galactic scale
these vortex ﬁlaments then link the black holes which are necessarily present in
galaxies. As well they provide a possible explanation for the Allais solar eclipse
eﬀect, in that the anomalous precession of the paraconical pendulum during a solar
eclipse appears to indicated the presence of at least a vortex ﬁlament linking the
minimal black hole within the sun with the corresponding minimal black hole within
the earth, with the moon and its black hole disturbing the earth-sun vortex ﬁlament
during a solar eclipse. More complicated scenarios could have an earth-moon vortex
as well as a sun-moon vortex.

20

Stellar Structure

The structure of stars is very much based on the assumption that the Newtonian
theory of gravity is suﬃciently accurate. This leads to the Solar Standard Model
(SSM) in the case of the sun. However the new theory of gravity predicts at least
a minimal gravitational attractor at the centres of stars, with an associated event
horizon. This quantum-foam in-ﬂow singularity causes the gravitational acceleration
to be very diﬀerent to that from the Newtonian theory, as already illustrated by a
number of cases. Bahcall and Davis started an exploration of the sun by means of
neutrinos [55, 56], with that work resulting in the solar neutrino anomaly, namely
that all experiments, exploring diﬀerent portions of the solar neutrino spectrum,
reported a ﬂux less than that predicted. The solar neutrino ﬂux is determined
by the physical and chemical properties of the sun, such as density, temperature,
composition and so on. The current interpretation of the solar neutrino anomaly is
in terms of the neutrino masses and mixing leading to oscillations of νe into active
(νµ and/or ντ ) or sterile neutrino, νs.

which reveals a logarithmic pressure singularity at the centre. In a more realistic
modelling this eﬀect would probably be even more pronounced, as the density would
increase there as a consequence of such a pressure increase. Existing stellar structure
codes need modiﬁcation in order for this eﬀect to be explored, and for any signature
of the eﬀect on the neutrino ﬂux revealed. Because there is an event horizon at the
centre of stars, essentially a black hole eﬀect, though one very diﬀerent from that
of general relativity, an additional source of energy, and hence heating is available,
namely the radiation from matter falling into this black hole. This would, even by
itself, increase the temperature of the central region of stars.

we would expect an anomalous acceleration directed towards the sun, but decreasing
like 1/r. However the Pioneer 10/11 data does not indicate any such decrease, and
so we conclude that (i) there is no evidence yet for such a non-minimal attractor, and
(ii) that the new theory of gravity does not oﬀer an explanation for this anomalous
acceleration.

Laboratory Quantum Gravity Experiments

Quantum gravity eﬀects are really just quantum-foam in-ﬂow eﬀects. As discussed
in Sect.10 such eﬀects have been manifest in ongoing attempts to measure G over

40

the last 60 years. There they showed up as O(α) unexplained systematic eﬀects.
The new theory of gravity has two fundamental constants α and G, and clearly one
cannot measure one of these alone. These G measurement experiments basically
measure the force between two test masses as a function of separation distance.
Using the linearity of the Newtonian theory of gravity the computation of these
forces involves a vector sum of the forces between the individual mass points in
the diﬀerent test masses. However in the new theory there is a non-linearity whose
magnitude is determined by α.

Assuming a stationary in-ﬂow the velocity ﬁeld is given by

with the ansatz that the direction of v(r) is the same as the direction of g(r), where
this gravitational acceleration is given by

It is easier to see the eﬀects of the non-linearity of the ‘dark matter’ term by
computing and displaying this matter density in those cases relevant to a Cavendish-
type laboratory experiment in which both α and G are measured together. In Fig.8
is shown the ‘dark matter’ density for two spheres for the cases of two separation
distances. Here we have ignored the inhomogeneity of the in-ﬂow of the earth. When
the spheres are well separated the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect occurs at the centre of each
sphere, but as they are brought together the non-linearity of the eﬀect causes the
‘dark matter’ density to become essentially polarised, this ‘dark matter’ polarisation
is evident in Fig.8, that is, in each mass it moves away from the centre, and there is
also a small region of ‘dark matter’ that forms outside and between the two spheres.
Because of this non-linear polarisation eﬀect the net force between the two spheres
is not describable by the Newtonian theory. However the leading eﬀect is that the
‘dark matter’ mass depends on the geometry of the masses used. The deviations
from the Newtonian theory then permit the experimental determination of α from
such an experiments. This eﬀect is a key prediction and provides a critical test of
the new theory. An analysis of the data requires numerical solutions of the ﬂow
ﬁelds for each conﬁguration of the masses in such an experiment. The magnitude
of the ‘dark matter’ mass is
α/2, i.e. 0.3%, but the main observable eﬀect is the
dependence of this mass on the geometry of the objects, which experiment suggests
is at the 0.1 % level.

22 Conclusions

We have seen that the solar system was too special to have revealed key aspects
of gravity. These only become evident when Newtonian gravity is re-formulated in
terms of a velocity in-ﬂow ﬁeld. A generalisation of that formalism leads to an expla-
nation of the so-called ‘Dark Matter’ eﬀect. The most signiﬁcant aspect of this work
is the discovery that the magnitude of the ‘dark matter’ spatial self-interaction dy-
namics is determined by the ﬁne structure constant α, while Newton’s gravitational
constant G only determines the interaction of space with matter. It has been shown
how the values of α and G together may be determined in Cavendish-type laboratory
experiments. Also signiﬁcant is the discovery that this new theory of gravity leads to
gravitational attractors - a new form of black hole, and whose properties are deter-
mined by the value of α and not G. As a consequence we saw how these attractors
explain the observed globular cluster black hole masses, and similarly the necessity
for black holes in galaxies. We also saw that primordial non-minimal black holes
explain both the origin and nature of spiral galaxies, particularly their rotational
behaviour. This new theory of gravity has its origins in the information-theoretic
Process Physics, which oﬀers as well an explanation and uniﬁcation of the quantum
nature of space and matter, and their classicalisation [8]. That work implies that
the occurrence of α in the new classical description of gravity is indicative of the un-
derlying quantum processes of space, that space is a complex quantum-information
theoretic system, and at that level it is not geometric. The results herein imply that
we have the ﬁrst evidence of quantum aspects of gravity.

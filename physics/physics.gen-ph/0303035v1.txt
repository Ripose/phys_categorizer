ON EINSTEINIAN ORBITS OF CELESTIAL BODIES

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. It can be demonstrated that no motion of masses can gener-
ate gravitational waves. Accordingly: i) the time decrease of the orbital
period of the famous binary PSR1913+16 cannot yield an experimen-
tal proof of the emission of gravitational waves; ii) measurements of the
propagation of the quasar J0842+1835 radio-signals past Jupiter cannot
reveal the propagation of gravitational waves sent forth by the planet
in its motion around the Sun:
indeed, this motion does not generate
any gravitational radiation; iii) the binary RX J0806.3+1527 has the
shortest known revolution period (only 321 s): however, it cannot be
a candidate for the detection of gravitational waves because no kind of
motion of a mass can give origin to a gravitational wave.

Introduction

Innumerable papers have been written on the Einsteinian orbits of the
celestial bodies. For clear reasons, the overwhelming majority of them are
of a perturbative character. In the present Note I consider the above orbits
only so far as the hypothesized emission of gravitational waves is concerned.
Now, we shall see that from this standpoint it is possible to develop some
very simple and general considerations from which one can conclude that no
motion of the celestial bodies gives origin to a gravitational radiation.

1.– Theory

Several arguments prove that no motion of masses can generate gravita-
tional waves [1]. An essential demonstration may be resumed in the following
way.

Consider a continuous medium characterized by whatever mass tensor
Tjk(x), (j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3), and let gjk(x) be the solution of the Einstein ﬁeld
equations corresponding to a generic motion with respect to a given reference
system x ≡ (x0, x1, x2, x3). Suppose to follow ideally the motion of a given
mass element describing a world line L, and suppose that at a given time
this element begins to emit a gravitational wave. Now, if we refer its motion
to some Riemann-Fermi coordinates z ≡ (z0, z1, z2, z3) [2], the components
hjk(z) of the metric tensor will be equal to some constants for all points of L.
This means that the gravitational ﬁeld onL can be obliterated: consequently,
no gravitational wave can be actually sent forth by the considered mass
element. But line L is quite generic, and therefore no motion of the medium
gives origin to a gravitational radiation.

It is implicit in the above reasoning that no gravitational damping force

has inﬂuenced the motion of our mass element.

2.– On the binary PSR1913+16

According to many authors, an indirect experimental proof of the physi-
cal existence of the gravitational waves is given by the time decrease of the
orbital period Pb of the binary radiopulsar PSR1913+16 [3]. The measured
value of dPb/dt is −(2.30 ± 0.22) · 10−12, while the quadrupole formula of the
linearized relativity gives a dPt/dt due to a hypothesized emission of gra-
vitational radiation equal to −2.4 · 10−12. An excellent agreement with the
observational data has been also obtained by computations at third order of
the gravitational constant and ﬁfth order in v/c. However, this agreement is
rather suspect owing to the unreliability of the adopted perturbative treat-
ments (cf.[4]).

As a matter of fact, we know from the theoretical proof of sect.1 that no
motion of the stars of the above binary system can generate gravitational
waves. Accordingly, it would be necessary to re-examine carefully the in-
ﬂuence on dPb/dt of those realistic eﬀects that Damour and Taylor have
discarded as scarcely signiﬁcant [5].

On the other hand, the computations of Taylor et alii are based on the
assumption that the two stars of the system PSR1913+16 can be treated as
point masses so far as their motions are concerned: now, point masses inter-
acting only gravitationally describe geodesic lines (cf. the ﬁrst paper cited
in [1]), i.e. their motions are ”free”, ”inertial” motions with no radiation
damping.

The conclusion is obvious: the binary PSR1913+16 gives no experimental

proof of the real existence of the gravity waves.

3.– On the motion of Jupiter

As is well known, as a consequence of the quadrupole formula of the
linearized relativity, the power of the gravitational radiation sent out by
Jupiter in its motion around the Sun is ≈ 450 watt. (The power of the solar
electromagnetic radiation is about 1024 times greater). From the standpoint
of the exact theory, this result is a pure nonsense because – cf. sect.1 – no
motion of a body generates gravitational waves. However, the present as-
trophysical community gives an excessive credit to the linearized version of
general relativity and to perturbative computations starting from it. Thus,
in recent times we have seen a proclamation according to which an indirect
experimental detection of the gravitational waves emitted by Jupiter in its
motion would be quite possible, see Kopeikin and Fomalont [6]. These au-
thors declare that, owing to a rare alignment of Jupiter’s motion against the
quasar J0842+1835, measurements of the propagation of the quasar radio-
signals past Jupiter must be sensitive to the propagation of the gravitational
radiation emitted by the planet. However, Asada [7] and subsequently Will
[8], by means of more reasonable perturbative treatments, have proved the
non-existence of the Kopeikin-Fomalont eﬀect.

Of course, this result is obvious from the rigorous point of view of the

exact formulation of general relativity.

4.- On the binary RX J0806.3+1527

This binary system is composed of two white dwarfs revolving around
each other at a distance of only 8 · 104 km. The speed of the orbital mo-
tion is over 103km/s, the orbital period amounts to 321 s: it is the shortest
known revolution period, see Israel et alii [9]. These authors believe that
the above binary is an excellent candidate for the detection of the gravita-
tional waves, owing to the shortness of its period. According to them, the
space experiment LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), that will be
launched within 2020, will be able to reveal the gravitational waves emitted
by RX J0806.3+1527. Of course, this is a pure wishful thinking, see sect.1.
In conclusion, I desire also to emphasize that the astrophysical commu-
nity ”ignores” that the so-called gravitational waves are mere mathematical
undulations devoid of a real energy and a real momentum [10].

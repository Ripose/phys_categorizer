Abstract

An orbiting ‘photon clock’ is proposed to test directly the relativity of simultaneity of special
relativity. This is done by comparison of the arrival times at a ground station of three microwave
signals transmitted by two satellites following the same low Earth orbit.

PACS 03.30.+p

Einstein’s original paper on special relativity (SR) [1] discussed three physical eﬀects
which changed completely our conceptual understanding of space and time. These are:
relativity of simultaneity (RS), length contraction (LC) and time dilatation (TD). RS
and LC are closely related. In the space-time Lorentz transformation (LT) a:

′
= γ(x − vt)
x
t′ = γ(t − βx
c

)

(1)

(2)

both eﬀects result from the spatial dependence (the term −γβx/c) of the time trans-
formation equation (2). LC is given by a ∆t = 0 projection of the LT [2]. Because of
RS, events which are simultaneous in S (i.e. have ∆t = 0) are not so in S’, resulting in
LC [2, 3]. One hundred years after the publication of Einstein’s paper only the TD eﬀect
has been experimentally conﬁrmed. For a concise review of experimental tests of SR see
Reference [4]. Unlike LC, the TD eﬀect (a ∆x′ = 0 projection of the LT [2]) does not
involve RS since the space-time events concerned occur always at a ﬁxed position in S’
–the spatial coordinate of the clock under consideration.

The purpose of this letter is to propose a direct experimental test of RS. The enor-
mous improvement, in recent decades, of the precision of time measurements due to the
widespread application of atomic clocks much facilitates the test. A test of the related LC
eﬀect seems, in contrast, to be much more diﬃcult [4]. The proposed experiment is an ac-
tual realisation, in space, of the light-signal clock synchronisation procedure proposed by
Einstein in [1]. However, no actual experimental clock synchronisation is needed. At the
practical level the experiment can be considered as a sequel to the Spacelab experiment

aThe frame S’ (space-time coordinates x′,t′) moves along the positive x-axis of S (space-time coordinates x,t) with
velocity v. Ox′ is parallel to Ox. Clocks in S and S’ are synchronised so that t = t′ = 0 when the origins of S and S’
coincide. β ≡ v/c, γ ≡ 1/p1 − β2.

NAVEX [5] in which special and general relativity (TD and the gravitational red-shift)
were tested by comparing a caesium clock in a space shuttle in a low, almost-circular,
orbit around the Earth with a similar, synchronised, clock at a ground station. The
experiment requires two satellites, one of which could conveniently be the International
Space Station (ISS) which has orbit parameters similar to those of the NAVEX shuttle,
the other a shuttle, or other satellite, following the same orbit as the ISS but separated
from it by a few hundred kilometers.

A scheme of the proposed experiment is shown in Fig.1. Two satellites, A and B, in
low Earth orbit, separated by the distance L, pass near to a ground station C. Cartesian
coordinate systems are deﬁned in the co-moving inertial frame of the satellites (S’) and
the ground station (S). The origin of S’ is chosen midway between A and B with x′-axis
parallel to the direction of motion of the satellites and y′ axis outwardly directed in the
plane of the orbit. Ox and Oy are parallel to O’x and O’y at the position of closest
approach (culmination) of O’ to C. Clocks in S and S’ are synchronised at t = t′ = 0
at culmination, where the coordinates of O’ in S are: (x,y,z) = (0,H,D) and the relative
velocity of S and S’ is v. It is assumed in the following that for space time events at the
satellites the LT equations (1) and (2) are valid between the frames S and S’, not only at
t = t′ = 0, but for neighbouring times.

A microwave signal is sent from B towards A so as to arrive there at the time t′ = −L/c
(Fig.1a). The signal is detected and reﬂected promptly back towards B. After a delay
tD(A) the signal S(1)
A is sent from A to C. The reﬂected signal from A arrives back at
B at time t′ = 0 (Fig.1b). It is detected and reﬂected promptly back towards A. After
a delay tD(B) the signal SB is sent from B to C. At time t′ = L/c the inter-satellite
signal arrives for a second time at A and after the delay tD(A) sends the signal S(2)
A to
C (Fig1c). The space-time coordinates of the emission events of the signals S(1)
A , SB and
S(2)
A , as calculated using the LT (1) and (2) are presented in Table 1. Taking into account
the propagation times of the signals from A and B to C the following diﬀerences of arrival
times of the signals at C are found:

δtBA ≡ t(SB) − t(S(1)

It is interesting to note that RS, as manifested in the non-vanishing value of ∆t in (5)
when tD(A) = tD(B) = 0, is an O(β) eﬀect, not an O(β2) one as for LC and TD. The term
2βL/c in (5) originates from the second (spatially-dependent) term in the LT of time,(2),
responsible for RS. The orbital velocity of the ISS is 7.674 km/s (β = 2.56 × 10−5) [6].
Since the ground station velocity in much less than thisb, this is essentially the same as
the relative velocity in (5). Choosing L = 400km (for the ISS H ≃ 350km [6]) and setting

satellites A and B. The origin of S is at C.

tD(A) = tD(B) = 0 in (5) gives ∆t = 2βL/c = 68.3ns. Such a time diﬀerence is easily
measurable with modern techniques. Signal arrival times in the NAVEX experiment were
quoted with 1ns precision. The uncertainities in the clock rates for the relativity tests
in NAVEX corresponded to an experimental time resolution of ≃ 0.1ns over one rotation
period (1.6h) of the shuttle. The contribution of the last term on the right side of (5) is
negligible. For L/R = 1 and delays as long as 1µs it contributes only 0.05ns to ∆t for
β = 2.56 × 10−5. Thus ∆t is essentially independent of the distance between the satellites
and the ground station at culmination. During the total transit time of the microwave
signals in the ‘photon clock’ constituted by the satellites, they move in S only a distance
≃ 2Lβ = 10.2m. Diﬀerent times of emission of the signal sequence are easily taken into
account by a suitable choice of the delay times tD(A, B).

Although a particular coordinate system and clock synchronisation are used to cal-
culate the entries of Table 1 and the time diﬀerences δtBA and δtAB in (5), the quantity
∆t is independent of this choice, so no clock synchronisation is required to measure ∆t.
If, however, pre-synchronised clocks are availabe in the satellites they may be used to
generate the signal sequence: S(1)
A , without the necessity of ‘photon clock’ sig-
nals between the satellites. The latter in fact may be considered to eﬀect a real-time
synchronisation of hypothetical clocks in A and B. In this case, a simpler direct measure-
ment of RS is possible. Sending signals SA and SB at the same time in S’, when O’ is
at culmination, the LT (1) and (2) predict that the signals will be observed at C with a
time diﬀerence of γβL/c, half the value of ∆t in the photon clock experiment.

A , SB, S(2)

The ease of measurement of the O(β) RS eﬀect may be contrasted with the diﬃculty of
measuring, in a similar experiment, the O(β2) LC eﬀect. Using the value β = 2.56 × 10−5
appropriate for the ISS, the apparent contraction of the distance between the satellites
A and B, as viewed at some instant in S, of (1 − 1/γ)L, amounts to only 131µm for
L = 400km. It is hard to concieve any experiment using currently known techniques with
suﬃciently good spatial resolution to measure such a tiny eﬀect.

In a recent paper by the present author [4] it has been suggested, in order to avoid
certain casual paradoxes of SR, and to ensure translational invariance, that the origin
of the frame S’ in the LT (1) and (2) should be chosen to coincide with the position
of the transformed event (a ‘local’ LT). In this case it is predicted that ∆t = 0 for
tD(A) = tD(B) = 0 in (5) and that signals emitted simultaneously in S’ from A and B at
culmination will be received at the same time in S at C.

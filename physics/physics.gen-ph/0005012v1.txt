Time symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamics

and the structure of SpaceTime

Physics Department, Clark University, Worcester, MA, 01610, USA

C˘alin Galeriu

This paper begins with a critical analysis of the concept of ’material point particle’. We argue
that this concept is incompatible with the force laws of action-at-a-distance electrodynamics, and we
suggest that the trajectory of a particle (the world-line) should be looked upon as a string in static
equilibrium. By complementing our model with a time symmetric interaction law, we are led to a
straightforward derivation of the principles underlying the electromagnetic interaction between two
uniformly moving charged particles. An extension of our theory to the case of particles in arbitrary
motion shows that we have to modify Maxwell’s equations of the microscopic electromagnetic ﬁeld, in
order to accommodate a ﬁeld-strength tensor which is no longer antisymmetric. It is further argued
that the radiation reaction force gives another example of a 4-force which is not orthogonal to the
4-velocity, thus leading to a variable rest mass. The variation of the rest mass is then discussed from
the point of view of the equivalence principle of general relativity, and we end up with a theoretical
derivation of the homogenous Maxwell’s equations.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that the general solution of Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld is a sum of two
contributions, one due to the retarded potential and another due to the advanced potential [1]. Since the advanced
solution does not seem to be observed in nature, several approaches have been developed to deal with this problem.
Ritz [2] assumes that the retarded solution of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is of a more fundamental nature than Maxwell’s
equations from whom it initially originated. Dirac [3] instead stresses the importance of ingoing (advanced) and
outgoing (retarded) radiation ﬁelds as boundary conditions for Maxwell’s diﬀerential equations. The main result of
Dirac’s work is a derivation of the radiative reaction force acting on an accelerated electron, with no reference to the
internal structure of the electron. The theory however raises further questions, due to the introduction of acausal
eﬀects, and due to the ad hoc elimination of the divergence resulting from the interaction of the electron with its own
generated ﬁeld. Tetrode [4] has proposed to interpret the electromagnetic radiation as a consequence of an interaction
between a source and an observer. The elimination of the electromagnetic ﬁeld as a stand alone entity was not a new
idea. Ritz [2] has argued that the ﬁeld is a mathematical artifact, since one can observe only the Lorentz force acting
on charged particles. Relativistic action-at-a-distance electrodynamics considers the null cone of special relativity as
the surface of interparticle action [1]. By eliminating the electromagnetic ﬁeld one also eliminates the problem of the
self-interaction divergence, and this is one of the main advantages of action-at-a-distance electrodynamics [5]. Wheeler
and Feynman [6], using time symmetric action-at-a-distance and ﬁeld theory as equivalent and complementary tools,
have shown that, if we suppose a completely absorbing Universe, then all the advanced eﬀects are canceled out except
those which are comprised in the force of radiative reaction. They further describe how, in spite of the time symmetric
interaction used, the irreversibility of the emission process appears as a phenomenon of statistical mechanics connected
with the asymmetry of the initial conditions with respect to time. The elaborations in this present paper, although
not emerging directly from the work of the previously cited authors, are a further development of time symmetric
action-at-a-distance electrodynamics.

II. THE WORLD-LINE OF A PARTICLE IS A STRING IN STATIC EQUILIBRIUM

Consider the following paradoxical situation: a force along the x-axis can modify the y-component of the velocity
of a particle. An example of such a situation is the motion of a relativistic charged particle (with a non-zero initial
y-component of the velocity) in a uniform electric ﬁeld parallel to the x-axis [7]. The origin of this situation lies in
the fact that the magnitude of the 4-momentum is constant. The projection of the 4-momentum onto a 3D real space
introduces into the expressions of the x, y and z components of the relativistic momentum a dependence on the vx, vy
and vz components of the velocity. Thus, while vx is aﬀected more directly by the applied force, the vy component
needs also to change (when vx changes), such that the y-component of the relativistic momentum remains constant.
Since there is no a priori reason for the magnitude of the 4-momentum to be constant, one can at least ask whether
there is a physical interpretation for this remarkable fact. The answer to the question is: yes, there is a perfect
analogy between a string under constant tension and a world-line in 4D Minkowski space, between the tension in the

1

string (constant in magnitude and always tangent to the string) and the 4-momentum (constant in magnitude and
always tangent to the world-line). The analogy goes even further, since we can show that the equations of motion for
a material point particle are equivalent with the static equilibrium condition for a 4D string. Indeed, consider two
events, A and B, along the world-line of a particle, separated by an inﬁnitesimal interval ds = i c dτ , as shown in
Figure 1. Then the equation of motion of the particle

P B − P A

dτ

= F

can be rewritten as the static equilibrium condition

T B + (−T A) + f ds = 0

(1)

(2)

for a string under a tension T = icP/so = P/τo and acted upon by a linear force density f = −F /so (notice the
change of sign, related to the change in direction of the force, as pictured in Figure 1 - we thus have to consistently
swap attraction and repulsion when switching between the two models). For dimensional reasons we have introduced
the constant so = icτo, heuristically called ’the length of a particle’, measured along its world-line.

Although at this moment the advantage of writing (2) instead of (1) is not evident, we will recall that the static
description is closer to the mathematical structure of SpaceTime: ”The objective world simply is; it does not happen.
Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the life line [world-line] of my body, does a section of
this world come to life as a ﬂeeting image in space which continuously changes in time.” [8]

III. MATERIAL POINT PARTICLES ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ACTION-AT-A-DISTANCE

ELECTRODYNAMICS

Two fundamental postulates are required to describe the electromagnetic interaction between two uniformly moving
charged particles [9]. The ﬁrst postulate is that in a reference frame where all the source charges producing a
Coulombian electric ﬁeld E are at rest, the force on a charge q is given by F = qE independent of the velocity of the
charge in that frame [10]. The second postulate is the orthogonality of the 4-force to the 4-velocity, required in order
to have the constant magnitude of the 4-momentum preserved. From this two postulates one can calculate the 4-force
(in Gaussian units) with which a source charge Q, at rest at the origin, is acting on a test charge q, at a distance R
and moving with velocity v:

F real = ˆR

Qq
R2 γ(v)

F imag = ˆi

Qq
R2 γ(v)

vrad

c

(3)

(4)

where the radial component of the velocity is vrad = ˆR · v .
Although generally accepted, the above two postulates raise some questions. We usually think of a particle as being
a point in Minkowski space: ”We ﬁx our attention on the substantial point which is at the world-point x, y, z, t, and
imagine that we are able to recognize this substantial point at any other time.” [11]

But, from the local point of view, a point in Minkowski space is just a ﬁxed point, it does not have a velocity! The
velocity comes from the tangent to the world-line of the particle. Consequently we have to consider more that one
point (one instance of the material point particle) on the world-line in order to observe the velocity. We are thus lead
to the conclusion that the 4-force from (3)-(4), the relevant Minkowski vector of the problem, is incompatible with
the material point particle model, since we have in the 4-force (3)-(4) an explicit dependence on the velocity of the
test particle. Another argument in favor of our conclusion is that one cannot deﬁne, in SpaceTime, a relativistically
invariant distance between two interacting material point particles. This is because, due to the speed of light at which
the interaction propagates, the SpaceTime interval between the two points is null. There is no privileged reference
frame such that the two events be at the same place or happen at the same time (which would have allowed us to
deﬁne a relativistically invariant scalar - the distance between the particles in the same-time frame, or the delay
between the events in the same-place frame). The radius R entering (3)-(4) is the direct result of the selection of the
reference frame in which the source charge is at rest, but this, once again, requires us to consider the velocity of this
particle.

IV. AN IMAGINATIVE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF TIME SYMMETRIC ELECTRODYNAMICS

A strange thing happens when we introduce the ﬁnite velocity of propagation of the electromagnetic interaction.
While in the old instantaneous action model there is a strong electrostatic component directed along the line connecting
the two interacting particles, this is no longer the case when we introduce the retardation time.
It is no longer
intuitively clear why two attracting particles (in a system having no angular momentum) will end up in the same
SpaceTime point. However, we might imagine the actual electromagnetic 4-force as being the sum of two 4-forces (the
retarded and the advanced one, as shown in Figure 2) which are directed along the lines connecting the interacting
particles. In the stationary case the imaginary components of these 4-forces just cancel, and the real components
produce the Coulombian force. As we will see in the next section, this picture is correct, up to a change of sign for
the imaginary 4-force components.

V. AN ALL-GEOMETRICAL DERIVATION FOR THE ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERACTION

BETWEEN TWO UNIFORMLY MOVING PARTICLES

We will introduce now a physical model which is consistent with all the previous considerations.

Instead of a
material point particle with mass mo and charge q, we will consider a 4D string (the world-line) with linear mass
density µo = mo/so and linear charge density ρ = q/so. If particles are regarded as points, then each particle (one
point) interacts with all other particles (points) which lie in the past (or future) part of its light cone. On the other
hand, a particle of length so (an inﬁnitesimal length element along the world-line) interacts with all of the segments
of the world-lines of other particles which are included between the light cones of the starting point of the segment
so and of the ending point of the same segment. Accordingly, the electrostatic force law F = Qq/R2 between a point
source charge Q and a point test charge q will be replaced by a 4-force F = (ρQSo)(ρqso)/R2 = (Qq/R2)(So/so),
acting on a ’particle’ of length so, and corresponding to an electrostatic linear 4-force density law −f = F /so. Of
course, since the linear force density is meant to act on an inﬁnitesimal length element, the segment so has to be very
small (probably less than 10−15 cm), but still not zero, since it appears in the denominator of the linear mass, charge
and 4-force densities. It is obvious that, if the two particles are at rest, or move with the same velocity, then So = so,
and we recover the Coulombian electrostatic interaction. We will next show that, if there is a relative velocity between
the two particles, then the So/so length ratio is responsible for the dependence on the velocity of the 4-force given in
(3)-(4). We will thus analyze the situation of a source particle at rest, and of a test particle at a position R relative
to the ﬁrst one, moving with velocity v.

A. Length ratios for radial velocity

Consider ﬁrst the simpler case of only radial motion. We will use the same geometrical technique developed in [9].
If the test particle (AB) has only a radial velocity v, it will ’see’ a segment (FG) in the past of the source particle,
and a segment (HI) in the future, as shown in Figure 3.

DC = CE = i CB = i AB sin(−α)

AC = AB cos(−α)

F G = AD = AC − DC = AB [cos(−α) − i sin(−α)] = AB γ(v)(1 − v/c)

HI = AE = AC + CE = AB [cos(−α) + i sin(−α)] = AB γ(v)(1 + v/c)

Thus the length ratio for the retarded part is γ(v)(1 − v/c), and for the advanced part is γ(v)(1 + v/c).

B. Length ratios for arbitrary velocity

(7)

(8)

What happens if the test particle has a velocity, but not only in the radial direction? We will rotate our 3D reference
frame in such a way that the radial direction gives the Ox direction, and that the velocity of the test particle lies
in the (xOy) plane. The radial component of the velocity is therefore vy. Consider a point A on the world-line of

3

the second particle, as shown in Figure 4. We have to ﬁnd the points H and J at which the world-line of the source
particle intersects the light cones of the point A. For this we draw, from the point A, a parallel to Oy, which intersects
the (xOict) plane at B. From B, a parallel to Ox intersects the Oict axis at C, and the world-line of the source particle
at F.

OC = EF = ict

xt2 + (R + vyt)2

For the segment IJ from the future:

IJ = EJ − EI = EF + F J − EI = ict + iqv2

xt2 + (R + vyt)2 − iR

Assuming an inﬁnitesimal length OA of the test particle, and using l’Hˆopital rule, it follows that:

Thus the length ratio for the retarded part is γ(v)(1 − vrad/c), and for the advanced part is γ(v)(1 + vrad/c).

C. The postulates of the new time symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamics

Corresponding to the length ratios just derived, if we have a source particle of charge Q (a world-line of linear
charge density Q/so) at rest at the origin, a test particle of charge q (a segment of length so along a world-line of
linear density q/so) will ’see’ a charge Qγ(v)(1 − vrad/c) in the past, and a charge Qγ(v)(1 + vrad/c) in the future.
We postulate that, in the reference frame in which the source particle is at rest, the 4-force acting on the test particle
will have a real radial component proportional to the (-2) power of the distance R on the real axis, and an imaginary
component proportional to the (-2) power of the distance iR on the imaginary axis. Consequently, attraction on the
real axis is associated with repulsion on the imaginary axis, and vice versa. Both components of the 4-force will be

4

proportional to the product of charges. We also postulate that we have interaction with both the future and the past.
Because the two contributions will add, the proportionality constant in the Coulombian 4-force will be multiplied
by 1/2. This corresponds to adding one half of the retarded potential to one half of the advanced one, in a time
symmetric electrodynamics [1].

The 4-forces acting on the test particle, as shown in Figure 5, will be:

in agreement with (3) and (4).

We believe that the geometrical derivation of the Coulombian interaction between two charged particles that we
in my opinion physical laws might ﬁnd their most perfect

have given brings us closer to Minkowski’s vision: ”[...]
expression as reciprocal relations between these world-lines.” [11]

Our theory of time symmetric action-at-a-distance electromagnetic interaction applies well to the case of uniformly
moving charged particles. It is worth remembering that, although initially emerging from experiments with electro-
static charge distributions and stationary currents, ”Maxwell’s equations are often used in a wider context, such as
for accelerating charges, than the experimental evidence, on the basis of which they are normally developed.” [12]
Maxwell’s equations for accelerated charges are thus checked only a posteriori. In a recently developed action-at-a-
distance Gaussian electrodynamics [13] new tangential force components are also predicted for accelerated charges.

VI. THE RADIATIVE REACTION 4-FORCE IS PARALLEL TO THE 4-VELOCITY

It is not hard to see that, if we apply our interaction model to accelerated charges, then the total 4-force, in general,
will no longer be orthogonal to the 4-velocity of the test particle. It can be shown that, in general, our relativistic
Lorentz 4-force is still given by Fα = (q/c)TαβVβ, with the only diﬀerence that the ﬁeld-strength tensor Tαβ is no
longer antisymmetric. We will try ﬁrst to answer the fundamental question of whether a 4-force can be not orthogonal
to the 4-velocity.

This problem has appeared long ago, when the ponderomotive 4-force, in a system which dissipates energy by
Joule heating, was considered [14]. Abraham [15] has shown that, since an inertial mass must be ascribed to every
kind of energy (E = moc2), the rest mass of the system has to decrease, corresponding to the Joule heat dissipated.
The ponderomotive 4-force must thus have a component parallel to the 4-velocity, and the equations of motion are
modiﬁed accordingly:

F =

d
dτ

(moV) = mo

dV

+ V

dmo
dτ

(27)

It is worth mentioning that equation (27) can still be interpreted as the static equilibrium conditions for a 4D string,
however this time under a variable tension (the tension is proportional to the rest mass). From (27), the rate of energy
dissipation is given by the 4-force component parallel to the 4-velocity:

5

(F · V) = −c2 dmo

dτ

= −γ(v)

dE
dt

(28)

It is questionable why the same approach has not been applied to the case of radiation damping. The radiative
reaction force is introduced in order to satisfy an energy balance, for the nonrelativistic situation ﬁrst [10]. Thus the
work done by the radiative reaction force has to equal the energy dissipated through electromagnetic radiation:

c3 Z t2

c3 Z t2

(¨v · v)dt

(29)

The last part of (29) results from the Larmor power formula (34), if we integrate by parts, and assume that the motion
is either periodic, or ( ˙v · v) = 0 at the moments t1 and t2. The radiation reaction force extracted this way is thus
somehow averaged, and it does not reﬂect the instantaneous damping force.

In a ﬁrst questionable step, from (29) the radiative reaction force is extracted as:

F rad =

2
3

q2
c3

¨v

(30)

We have to warn that, since in (29) F rad is in scalar product with v, the only meaningful information that can be
extracted is about the component of the force which is parallel to the velocity, (F rad · v)v/v2! Another problem
related to the expression (30) is that it is not clear whether the force is indeed a damping force, pointing in the
opposite direction than the velocity. This problem is evident if we consider the ’runaway’ solution [10], in which
the velocity, the acceleration and the acceleration’s derivative are all parallel, pointing in the same direction, and
increasing exponentially.

In a second questionable step, the force from (30) is generalized [1,7,14] to the relativistic case by introducing the
derivative with respect to the proper time, and by adding an extra term, speciﬁcally needed to ensure the orthogonality
between the 4-force and the 4-velocity. The relativistic 4-force obtained this way is:

F rad =

]

(31)

Since the only reason for being of the radiation reaction force is to account for the dissipation of energy, and this
dissipation is accompanied by a decrease in the rest mass of the system, and furthermore only the component of the
force parallel to the velocity enters the equation, we can safely consider the radiation reaction 4-force as being parallel
to the 4-velocity. Therefore, there is no need for the last term in (31).

By extracting, from the ﬁrst term in (31), the component parallel to the 4-velocity, and by requiring that this force

point in the opposite direction than the 4-velocity, we obtain:

1
−c2
From (28) and (32) we can calculate the rate of energy dissipation:

VII. ON A MACROSCOPIC SCALE, THE 4-FORCE COMPONENT PARALLEL TO THE 4-VELOCITY

CANCELS

We now make the following conjecture: that the averaged electromagnetic 4-force (Lorentz force + radiative reaction)
is still orthogonal to the 4-velocity. Our conjecture is based on the detailed analysis of a simple situation, shown in
Figure 6. A source particle moves with uniform radial velocity up to a point A, where its velocity is changed, and the

6

uniform radial motion continues afterwards. During this time a test particle is held at rest by other external forces
that exactly cancel the 4-force due to the source particle. It is evident that, before the point B or after the point
D, the test particles ’sees’ a uniformly moving source, with no apparent change of velocity between the retarded and
advanced positions. Therefore, only on the segment BD can the electromagnetic 4-force have a component parallel to
the 4-velocity of the test particle. We will calculate the total change of the rest mass (of the tension), on the segment
BD, and we will show that there is no net change. For this, consider the interaction with the advanced source, as
shown in Figure 7. A particle at point P will be subject to a real 4-force and to an imaginary 4-force, given in the
proper reference frame of the source particle. Thus the total component parallel to the 4-velocity of the test particle
will be:

√c2 − v2 − F
The magnitude of the 4-force F will depend on the radial distance:

Fk = iF cos(−α) − F sin(α) = iF

Remarkably, this expression has no dependence on the velocity v of the source. A similar expression, but of a diﬀerent
sign, is obtained for the interaction with the retarded source. The overall change of the rest mass (of the tension in
the string) is zero! Thus only on a time scale of R/c, where R is the distance between accelerated interacting charges,
could someone hope to experimentally detect the variation of the rest mass.

An essential part of our treatment was the separation of charges into test and source particles. Since even the
problem of two particles interacting one with the other through retarded potentials is not tractable, it is hard to
believe that our conjecture will ever become a theorem.

VIII. THE VARIATION OF THE REST MASS IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE EQUIVALENCE

PRINCIPLE

Consider an inﬁnitesimal SpaceTime volume element, surrounding an inﬁnitesimal length element of a particle’s
world-line. What happens if we bring a massive body, generating gravitation, in the proximity of our initial particle?
The Riemann metric tensor of the space will change, modifying the volume, phenomenologically producing a change
in the mass density of the volume element. In the above description we have implicitly considered that the rest mass
of the test particle remains constant. But it has to be realized that we have no control over the mass of the particle!
This mass cancels from the equations of motion, as a result of the equivalence principle [16]: ”[...] the law of the
equality of the inert and the gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a
body by a gravitational ﬁeld is independent of the nature of the body.” We can alternatively imagine the result of
the process of bringing the massive body closer to our test particle as being a change in the rest mass of the particle,
while preserving the Minkowski metric, such that we end up with the same change of the mass density.

We have also implicitly assumed that the linear charge density is not changed during the variation of the linear rest
mass density. This is because the electric charge is not correlated with inertia, in contrast to mass and energy. Our
assumption is also in qualitative agreement with experimental results from Particle Physics which indicate that the
charge of a particle can take only a quantized value, while the rest mass is not subject to such a restraint.

IX. A THEORETICAL DERIVATION OF THE HOMOGENOUS MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS USING THE

RIEMANNIAN STRUCTURE OF SPACETIME

We now generalize the relativistic Lorentz 4-force, such that the radiation reaction be included into the ﬁeld-strength
tensor. We exploit the fact that any 4-force parallel to the 4-velocity can be written as the contraction between a
symmetric tensor and the 4-velocity.

Consider next two spacetime events, A and B, and a charged particle moving from A to B on any possible smooth
path Γ, restricted only to the conditions that the initial and ﬁnal velocities be given. Since the direction of the ﬁnal
4-momentum is given ab initio, and its magnitude is given by the rest mass (which is uniquely determined by the
Riemann metric tensor at point B, following our analogy, and does not depend on the history of the test particle),
we can conclude that the variation of the 4-momentum between A and B is the same regardless of the path followed.
For two diﬀerent paths, Γ1 and Γ2, we can write

P B − P A =ZΓ1

dP =ZΓ2

This is the most general condition that the ﬁeld-strength tensor must satisfy. From (44) we can separate the symmetric

From (46) we obtain two more equations by cyclic permutations of the indices (α → β, β → γ, γ → α). By summing up
the three equations thus obtained, the symmetric components cancel, and we end up with the homogenous Maxwell’s
equations:

X. LOOSE ENDS

The theory we have developed stresses the importance of the world-line of a particle, seen as a string in static
equilibrium. How can this picture be reconciled with the Quantum Mechanics elimination of the concept of trajectory?
An intuitive answer would be: by considering a vibrating string. This would of course require the introduction of a
ﬁfth dimension, which could be considered as ’the hidden parameter’. Time and Space would no longer be treated
on a diﬀerent footing [18] (time as a parameter and position as an operator), in complete agreement with Special
Relativity.

What is more, irreversibility could be introduced as an eﬀect of the ’collapsing of the wave-function’ resulted from
performing a measurement. The human observer, the human conscience, would thus be inherently recognized as
extending into the ﬁfth dimension. The speed ic, at which the human conscience is ’traveling’ in time, is to be
correlated with the velocity of a transverse wave in a string of linear mass density µo = mo/so and under a tension
T = icP/so = i2c2mo/so:

vtransverse wave =s T

µo

= ic

XI. CONCLUSIONS

(48)

We have presented a series of intuitive arguments which suggest that the world-line of a particle be considered
as a string in static equilibrium. We have proposed a model of time symmetric action-at-a-distance electromagnetic
interaction, which reduces to the classical theory in the case of uniformly moving particles. We have argued that
the radiation reaction 4-force should be parallel to the 4-velocity, and that the electromagnetic ﬁeld-strength tensor
should have a symmetric part, which cancels upon averaging. The equivalence principle has allowed us to draw a
parallel between our model and General Relativity, and we have derived the homogenous Maxwell’s equations as a
consequence of the Riemannian structure of SpaceTime.

4D string (b).

FIG. 2. While in the instantaneous action model (a) the force is directed along the line connecting the interacting particles,
this is no longer the case when we introduce the retardation time (b). However, a time symmetric interaction model (c) could
restore the initial intuitive situation.

FIG. 3. Length ratios for a source particle (world-line FI) at rest and a test particle (world-line AB) moving with radial

velocity.

FIG. 4. Length ratios for a source particle (world-line GJ) at rest and a test particle (world-line OA) moving with arbitrary

velocity.

FIG. 5. Calculated in the proper reference frame of the source particle, the real and imaginary components of the advanced

and retarded 4-forces add up to the relativistic Lorentz 4-force.

FIG. 6. The variation of the rest mass takes place only on a time scale of R/c, where R is the distance between accelerated

interacting charges.

FIG. 7. The test particle is held at rest, at the origin, and the source particle has a radial uniform motion, interrupted only

at point A. The total variation of the rest mass of the test particle, along the segment BD, is zero.

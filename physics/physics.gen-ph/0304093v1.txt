We have found an empirical law for the variation of the length of the day with geologic time. The predication of

law has been found to be in agreement with the hitherto known data. This law requires the age of the Universe
to be 11 × 109 year old. The day increases at a present rate of 0.002 sec/century. The length of the day is found

to be 6 hours when the earth formed.

Introduction

According to Mach’s principle the inertia of an object is not a mere property of the object but depends

on how much matter around the object. This means that the distant universe would aﬀect this property.

Owing to this, we would expect a slight change in the strength of gravity with time. This change should

aﬀect the Earth-Moon-Sun motion. It is found that the length of the day and the number of days in

the year do not remain constant. From coral fossil data approximately 400 million years (m.y.) ago,

it has been estimated that there were little over 400 days in a year at that time. It is also observed

that the Moon shows an anomalous acceleration (Dickey, 1994). As the universe expands more and

more matter appears in the horizon. The expansion of the universe may thus have an impact on the

Earth-Moon-Sun motion. Very recently, the universe is found to be accelerating at the present time

(Peebles, 1999, Bahcall et al., 1999). To account for this scientists suggested several models. One way

to circumvent this is to allow the strength of gravity to vary slightly with time. For a ﬂat universe,

where the expansion force is balanced by gravitational attraction force, this would require the universe

to accelerate in order to avoid a future collapse. This is made by allowing the Newton’s constant to vary

(increase) with time very slowing. A secure way to do this is to deﬁne an eﬀective Newton’s constant,

which embodies this variation while keeping the ‘bare’ Newton’s constant unchanged. The idea of having

an eﬀective constant, which shows up when a system is interacting with the outside world, is not new.

For instance, an electron in a solid moves not with its ‘bare’ mass but rather with an eﬀective mass. This

eﬀective mass exhibits the nature of interaction in question. With the same token, one would expect a

celestial object to interact (couple) with its eﬀective constant rather than the normal Newton’s constant,

which describes the strength of gravity in a universe with constant mass. This idea is more genuine than

having summed all perturbations (due to gravity) aﬀecting the system. With this minimal change of

the ordinary Newton’s constant to an eﬀective one, one ﬁnds that Kepler’s laws can give the present

lengthening of the day, without altering Kepler’s laws or invoking any other phenomena. Thus one gets

a rather modiﬁed Newton’s law of gravitational and Kepler’s laws deﬁned with this eﬀective constant.

The entire history of the Earth has not been discovered so far. Very minute data are available owing

to diﬃculties in deriving it. Geologists derived some information about the length of the day in the pats

from the biological growth rhythm preserved in the fossil records (e.g., bi-valves, corals, stromatolites,

etc). The ﬁrst study of this type was made by the American scientist John Wells (1963), who investigated

the variation of the number of days in the year from the study of fossil corals. He inferred, from the

sedimentation layers of calcite made by the coral, the number of days in the year up to the Cambridge era.

Due to the lack of a well-preserved records, the information about the entire past is severely hindered.

The other way to discover the past rotation is to extrapolate the presently observed one. This method,

however, could be very misleading.

2- THE MODEL

Recently, we proposed a cosmological model for an eﬀective Newton’s constant (Arbab, 1997) of the form

Geﬀ. = G0

β

t
t0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

(1)

where the subscript ‘0’ denotes the present value of the quantity: G0 is the normal (bare) Newton’s

constant and t0 is the present age of the Universe. Here Geﬀ. includes all perturbative eﬀects arising

from all gravitational sources. We remark here that G0 does not vary with time, but other perturbations

induce an eﬀect parameterized in Geﬀ. in the equation of motion. We remark here that β is not well

determined (β > 0) by the cosmological model.

The Kepler’s 2nd law of motion for the Earth-Sun system, neglecting the orbit eccentricity, can be

written as

G2

eﬀ.[(M + m)2m3] Teﬀ. = 2πL3 ,

where m, M are the mass of the Earth and the Sun respectively; L is the orbital angular momentum of

the Earth and T is the period (year) of the Earth around the Sun. Thus one can still use Kepler’s law

as in eq.(2) instead of adding other perturbations from the near bye bodies to the equation of motion of

the Earth. It also deﬁnes an eﬀective value for the length of the year (Teﬀ.).

The orbital angular momentum of the Earth (around the Sun) is nearly constant. From equation (2),

one can write

where T0 = 365 days and G0 = 6.67 × 10−11 Nm2kg−2.

To reproduce the data obtained by Wells for the number of days in a year, one would require the

eﬀective Newton’s constant to vary as (β = 1.3)

and the present age of the universe to be 11 × 109 year. Thus, this law could open a new channel for
providing valuable information about the expansion of the Universe. Astronomers usually search into

the space to collect their data about the Universe. This well determined value of β is crucial to the

predictions of our cosmological model.

From eqs. (3) and (4) one ﬁnds the eﬀective number of days in the year (Teﬀ.) to be

and since the length of the year is constant, the eﬀective length of the day (Deﬀ.) is given by

so that

We see that the variation of the length of day and month is a manifestation of the changing conditions

(perturbation) of the Earth which are parameterized as a function of time (t) only.

3- RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The Wells’s fossil data is shown in Table 1 and our corresponding values are shown in Table 2. In fact, the

length of the year does not change, but the length of the day was shorter than now in the past. So, when

the year is measured in terms of days it seems as if the length of the year varies. Sonett et al. (1996)

have shown that the length of the day 900 m.y ago was 19.2 hours, and the year contained 456 days.

Our law gives the same result (see Table 2). Using coral as a clock, Poropudas (1991, 1996) obtained an

approximate ancient time formula based on fossil data. His formula shows that the number of days in the

year is 1009.77 some 3.556 b.y. ago. Our law shows that this value corresponds rather to a time 3.56 b.y.

ago, and that the day was 8.7 hours. He suggested that the day to be 5 - 7 hours at approximately 4.5

b.y. ago. Ksanfomality (1997) has shown that according to the principle of isochronism all planets had

an initial period of rotation between 6 - 8 hours. However, our model gives a value of 6 hours (see Table

2). Berry and Baker (1968) have suggested that laminae, ridges and troughs, and bands on present day

and Cretaceous bivalve shells are growth increments of the day and month, respectively. By counting the

number of ridges and troughs they therefore ﬁnd that the year contains 370.3 days in the late Cretaceous.

Recently, McNamara and Awramik (1992) have concluded, from the study of Stromatolites, that at

about 700 m.y. ago the number of days in a year was 435 days and the length of the day was 20.1

hours. In fact, our model shows that this value corresponds more accurately to 715 m.y. ago. Vanyo

and Awramik (1985) has investigated Stromatolites, that is 850 m.y. old, obtained a value between 409

and 485 days in that year. Our law gives 450 days in that year and 19.5 hours in that day. This is a big

success for our law. Here we have gone over all data up to the time when the Earth formed. We should

remark that this is the ﬁrst model that gives the value of the length of the day for the entire geologic

past time.

The present rate of increase in the length of the day is 0.002 ms/century. Extrapolating this astro-

nomically determined lengthening of the day since the seventeenth century leads to 371 days in the late

Cretaceous (65 m.y. ago). The slowing down in the rotation is not uniform; a number of irregularities

have been found. This conversion of Earth’s rotational energy into heat by tidal friction will continue

indeﬁnitely making the length of the day longer. In the remote past the Earth must have been rotating

very fast. As the Earth rotational velocity changes, the Earth will adjust its self to maintain an equilib-

rium (shape) compatible with the new situation. In doing so, the Earth should have experienced several

geologic activities. Accordingly, one would expect that the tectonic movements (plate’s motion) to be

attributed to this continued adjustment.

We plot the length of day (in hours) against time (million years back) in Fig.(1). We observe that the

plot deviates very much from straight line. The plot curves at two points which I attribute the ﬁrst one

to emergence of water in huge volume resulting in slowing down the rotation of the Earth’s spin. The

second point is when water becomes abundant and its rate of increase becomes steady. These two points

correspond to 951 m.a. and 3460 m.a., and their corresponding lengths of day are 18.8 and 8.9 hours,

respectively.

4- CONCLUSION

We have constructed a model for the variation of length of the day with time. It is based on the idea

of an eﬀective Newton’s constant as an eﬀective coupling representing all gravitational eﬀects on a body.

This variation can be traced back over the whole history of the Earth. We obtained an empirical law for

the variation of the length of the day and the number of days in a year valid for the entire past Earth’s

rotation. We have found that the day was 6 hours when the Earth formed.

The change in the strength of gravity is manifested in the way it inﬂuences the growth of biological

systems. Some biological systems (rythmites, tidalites, etc) adjust their rhythms with the lunar motion

(or the tide). Thus any change in the latter system will show up in the former. These data can be

inverted and used as a geological calendar. The data we have obtained for the length of the day and

the number of days in the year should be tested against any possible data pertaining to the past’s Earth

rotation. Our empirical law has been tested over an interval as far back as 4500 m.y. and is found to be

in consistency with the experimental data so far known.

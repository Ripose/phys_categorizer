Lagrangian Approaches of Dirac and Feynman to

Quantum Mechanics

Yong-Gwan Yi∗

February 21, 2014

Abstract

Lagrangian method in quantum mechanics is discussed in a pedagogical
context. It is pointed out that introduction of the action principle into the
quantum theory is much in the way of a formal correspondence. A general
formulation of the action principle is outlined, embodying the main features
of Dirac’s and Feynman’s approaches to quantum mechanics. This review is
carried to a point further than that reached by these authors, in the discussion
of the action principle and correspondence. Judged by a criterion of corre-
spondence arguments energy levels of harmonic oscillator must be En = n¯hω
instead of being En = (n + 1/2)¯hω.

Introduction

Quantum mechanics, as usually understood, was built up on a foundation of analogy
with the Hamiltonian theory of classical mechanics. The Lagrangian method in
quantum mechanics was introduced by Dirac [1] on the mathematical foundation of
the analogy between canonical transformation and unitary transformation, which
was developed to bring out the quantum analogue of the principle of least action
in classical mechanics. The Lagrangian approach of Dirac was further studied by
Feynman [2], who has ultimately developed it into the integral equation formulation
of quantum mechanics.

In this review I shall try to pick out the essential logical points of the devel-
opments. We ﬁrst review the essential changes in physical idea required by the
Lagrangian method in quantum mechanics. We then show how a general action
function method in quantum mechanics can be outlined, embodying the main fea-
tures of Dirac’s and Feynman’s formalisms. This review is carried to a point further
than that reached by those authors, in Lagrangian approach to quantum mechanics.
In the continuation of reasoning the correspondence of the Schr¨odinger equation to
the classical Hamiltonian is reviewed and the resulting question that has opened to
us is discussed.

2 Action Function Methods

In 1933, Dirac took up the question of what corresponds in the quantum theory
to the principle of least action in classical mechanics. The equation of motion of
the classical theory causes the dynamical variables to vary in such a way that their
values at any time t′ are connected with their values at any other time t by a
contact transformation. In the quantum theory the wave function at any time t′
is related through a transformation function < x|x′ > to the wave function at any
other time t. On the mathematical foundation of the analogy between the classical
and quantum equations of motion he shows that

< x|x′ > corresponds to

eiS(x,x′)/¯h,

(1)

where the action S(x, x′) is the time integral from t′ to t of the Lagrangian L
taken along the path. In such a way the phases of the quantum-theoretical wave
function have just as great a physical signiﬁcance as their classical analogues. This
is the natural extension of the well-known result that the phase of wave function
corresponds to the action function in classical theory. By introducing a sequence of
intermediate times into the time interval, one may write S(x, x′) as

S(x, x′) = S(x, xn) + S(xn, xn−1) + · · · + S(x2, x1) + S(x1, x′).

(2)

The corresponding quantum equation is written

< x|x′ >= Z · · ·Z < x|xn > dxn < xn|xn−1 > · · · < x2|x1 > dx1 < x1|x′ > .

(3)
Equation (3) is valid only when we substitute for the intermediate coordinates in
its right-hand side their values for the real trajectory, small variations in which
values leave S stationary.
It is the process of substituting these values for the
intermediate coordinates which corresponds to the integrations over all values for
the intermediate coordinates in (3). The quantum analogue of the action principle
is thus absorbed in the composition law (3).

In 1948, Feynman showed how the physical idea of Dirac could be extended
to deﬁne a probability amplitude (wave function) for a speciﬁed path in space-
time. His formulation contained as its essential idea the concept of a probability
amplitude associated with a speciﬁed motion as a function of time. There a wave
function ψ(x′, t′) depends only upon the region previous to time t′, and is completely
deﬁned if that region is known. It does not depend, in any way, upon what will be
done to the system after time t′. The transformation theory of Dirac allows us to
consider ψ(x′, t′) as representing a state in a representation in which x′ is diagonal,
while ψ(x, t) represents the same state in a representation in which x is diagonal.
They are therefore related through the transformation function that relates the
representations:

ψ(x, t) = R < x|x′ > ψ(x′, t′) dx′,
ψ(x′, t′) = R < x′|x′′ > ψ(x′′, t′′) dx′′,

· · · .

(4)

Equation (4) was interpreted physically as the expression of Huygens’ principle
If the amplitude of the wave is known on a given surface, in
for matter waves.

2

particular the surface consisting of all x′ at time t′, its value at a particular nearby
point at time t is a sum of contributions from all points of the surface at t′. Each
contribution is delayed in phase by an amount proportional to the action it would
require to get from the surface to the point along the path of least action of classical
mechanics.

The foregoing review is only a sketch, but it may be suﬃcient to characterize the
development in formulation of the action principle in quantum mechanics. Looking
at the formalism equation (4) inspires an idea for the generalization of present the-
ories of matter waves, a generalization necessary to encompass present formalisms.
Equation (4) is a typical representation of the wave nature of matter, which dis-
plays close analogies with classical mechanics, but at the same time preserves the
characteristic features of the law of propagation of waves. Applying directly to
simple examples, Feynman had shown that the wave function so deﬁned actually
satisﬁed the Schr¨odinger equation. Although the proof was detailed, the method
deviated from a general way. Intuitively it seems more desirable to carry through
to a generalized theory of integral equation formulation. With this very reason I
now strive to clarify the mathematically formal content of his approach and present
its general method in quantum mechanics.

First of all we should mention the principle of least action in quantum mechanics.
As is well known there was little diﬃculty in setting up a Lagrangian for which the
Euler-Lagrangian equation, as obtained from the variational principle, agrees with
the Schr¨odinger equation. But the variational approach must be more than just a
matter of academic curiosity. This is because the formal analogy with the classical
mechanics is actually realized in such a Lagrangian rather than Hamiltonian:

(∇S)2

2m

− V ←→ Z (cid:20) ¯h2

2m

(∇ψ∗) · (∇ψ) − ψ ∗ V ψ(cid:21) dr.

(5)

From the form to which it corresponds, we infer the principle of least action to be
satisﬁed in quantum mechanics:

δZ L dt = 0 ←→ δZ Z (cid:20) ¯h2

2m

(∇ψ∗) · (∇ψ) − ψ ∗ V ψ(cid:21) drdt = 0.

(6)

Indeed it is more accurate to consider the Schr¨odinger equation as induced by the
Euler-Lagrange equation for a variational problem which has been formulated as
above. Although the Schr¨odinger equation was deduced on a foundation of analogy
with the Hamiltonian of the corresponding classical system, the same relation does
not always hold between operators as between the corresponding classical physical
In the Schr¨odinger equation ∇2ψ does not rigorously correspond to
quantities.
(∇S)2 in classical mechanics. As can be seen in the next section, it involves an
additional term corresponding to ∇2S. Only in the action principle can we ﬁnd the
quantum analogue of the classical equation of motion as closely as possible.

The close analogy between < x|x′ > and the quantity eiS(x,x′)/¯h was pointed out
by Dirac on the mathematical treatment inherent in the quantum theory. Therein
the transformation function < x|x′ > corresponding to eiS(x,x′)/¯h was regarded as
connecting the two representations in which x and x′ are diagonal respectively.
Physically the square of the modulus of < x|x′ > was interpreted as giving the rela-
tive a priori probability of any state yielding the results x and x′ when observations

3

are made of the coordinates at time t and at time t′. Accordingly we could consider
< x|x′ > as the amplitude for arrival at x, t starting from x′, t′. It seems therefore
that the simplest and most natural interpretation would be to regard < x|x′ >
as a quantum-theoretical expression of Green’s function for matter waves. Such
an interpretation leads us consequently to identify (3) with a quantum-theoretical
expression of Huygens’ principle for matter waves, by viewing the transformation
functions in (3) in terms of the Green’s functions. In this way equation (4) appears
in a new light.

Let < r|r′ > represent the generalization of < x|x′ > to three dimensions. Just
as the Green’s function is associated with the Helmholtz wave equation, so we may
associate with the Schr¨odinger wave equation a corresponding function < r|r′ >,
deﬁned by

from

(cid:0)∇2 + k2(cid:1) < r|r′ > = −δ(r − r′)
(cid:0)∇2 + k2(cid:1)ψ(r, t) = (cid:0)∇2 + k2(cid:1)Z < r|r′ > ψ(r′, t′) dr′.

(7)

We can illustrate the relation of (7) to the Sch¨odinger wave equation by introducing
the de Broglie wave-length for a moving particle. For bound states in which the
particle is restrained by the external force to a particular region, equation (7) would
result in the homogeneous diﬀerential equation for which analytic solutions are
possible. However, for unbound states in which the particle can approach from
and recede to inﬁnite distance, it leads to the inhomogeneous integral equation of
scattering theory,

ψ(r) = φ(r) −Z < r|r′ > V (r′)ψ(r′) dr′,

(8)

where φ is a solution of the homogeneous equation. Equation (7) deﬁnes the retarded
Green’s function or free-particle propagator appropriate for (8). We may consider
its Fourier transform, in terms of which the transformation function is written

1

k′2 − k2 + iǫ

,

ǫ −→ 0.

(9)

By making use of this Fourier transform of < r|r′ >, we can see in (8) the formal
expression for Born’s integral equation formulation. We now approach the integral
equation formulation of scattering theory by way of the action principle.

It is assumed that the eﬀect of scattering center on the particles can be repre-
sented by a potential energy V (r′, t′) which is appreciably diﬀerent from zero only
within a ﬁnite region and time. We may expect to approach it by noting that al-
terations of the wave states on r and r′ arise from a change in action. We can thus
specify the eﬀect of scattering by dividing S(r, r′) into two parts. Let

S(r, r′) = S0(r, r′) −Z V (r′, t′) dt′,

(10)

where S0(r, r′) is the action of the free particle and V (r′, t′) is the external disturbing
potential. For the electromagnetic interaction, the S−matrix expansion turns out to

4

converge rapidly so that we obtain results that agree extremely well with observation
just by considering the ﬁrst order approximation. Thus we may write

eiS(r,r

′)/¯h = eiS0(r,r
≈ eiS0(r,r

′,t′) dt′

′)/¯h−(i/¯h)R V (r
′)/¯hh1 − (i/¯h)Z V (r′, t′) dt′i,

from which we infer that

ψ(r, t) = φ(r, t) −Z eiS0(r,r

′)/¯hh(i/¯h)Z V (r′, t′) dt′iψ(r′, t′) dr′.

This may also be written symbolically as

ψ(r, t) = φ(r, t) −Z < r|r′ > h(i/¯h)Z V (r′, t′) dt′iψ(r′, t′) dr′.

(11)

(12)

(13)

Equation (13) can be iterated to give the wave function ψ in terms of V and φ and
hence to construct the exact propagator if the perturbing potential V is weak. The
formulation ﬁts in with treatment of the problem of a system that makes transition
from one state to others under the action of perturbation. In particular, by (11),
the connection with the radiation theory of quantum electrodynamics in which the
radiation interaction is treated as a small perturbation is naturally established [3].
One may compare this with Schwinger’s treatment in which the eﬀect of a small
perturbation has been described by the variation of the transformation δ(eiS/¯h) =
(iδS/¯h)eiS/¯h [4].

If we turn on another potential V (r′′, t′′) for an interval △t′′ at time t′′ > t′, the

additional contribution to the wave function for t > t′′ is, in analogy to (11),

eiS0(r,r

′′)/¯hh1 − (i/¯h)Z V (r′′, t′′) dt′′iψ(r′′, t′′).

(14)

The total wave arriving at (r, t) is then built up by summing over all possible places
and times for (r′′, t′′):

RR eiS0(r,r

×eiS0(r

′′,r

′′)/¯hh1 − (i/¯h)R V (r′′, t′′) dt′′i dr′′
′)/¯hh1 − (i/¯h)R V (r′, t′) dt′iψ(r′, t′) dr′,

which may thus be written out in the form

(15)

(16)

RR < r|r′′ > dr′′ < r′′|r′ > ψ(r′, t′) dr′
−(i/¯h)RRR < r|r′′ > dr′′ < r′′|r′ > V (r′, t′)ψ(r′, t′) dt′dr′
−(i/¯h)RRR < r|r′′ > V (r′′, t′′) dt′′dr′′ < r′′|r′ > ψ(r′, t′) dt′dr′
+(i/¯h)2RRRR < r|r′′ > V (r′′, t′′) dt′′dr′′ < r′′|r′ > V (r′, t′)ψ(r′, t′) dt′dr′.

The argument can be extended to the case that ψ is a state with four indices

corresponding function to be associated with the Dirac wave equation:

(γµpµ − mc) < r|r′ >= −δ(r − r′),

(17)

where we have used covariant relativistic notations, four matrices γµ and four-
momentum pµ. The covariant transformation < r|r′ > as the free-particle propa-
gator is given by Fourier transforming to momentum space, by

1

γµpµ − mc + iǫ

or

γµpµ + mc

p2 − m2c2 + iǫ

.

(18)

This is known as Feynman’s free propagator. In parallel with the previous argu-
ments we may apply the propagator formalism now to scattering problems of quan-
tum electrodynamics. Note that the formalism thus developed ﬁts into Feynman’s
version of quantum electrodynamics [5].

Given the wave function deﬁned in (4), all of the machinery of operator equation
can be developed. In the development Feynman denominated the integral equation
of (4) as essentially a third formulation of non-relativistic quantum theory, following
the matrix algebra of Heisenberg and the diﬀerential equation of Schr¨odinger. The
formulation contains as its essential idea the concept of a superposition of matter
waves the phases of which correspond to the action. However, it is not a fundamen-
tally new approach; it is the integral form of the Schr¨odinger equation in which the
transformation function has become a link relating the two equations, diﬀerential
and integral.

With the Green’s function G(r, r′) in place of < r|r′ > equation (4) was the
starting point of his approach in the next year to quantum electrodynamics. There
was no remark concerning the relation of < r|r′ > to G. Only shortly later did
Feynman state that they were identical for small time interval [6]. However, the
perfect parallelism in the formulation between < r|r′ > and G makes it obvious that
they are entirely identical. The reconciliation of < r|r′ > with G certainly uniﬁes
the mathematically formal contents of his approaches to quantum mechanics and
quantum electrodynamics.

3 Wave Equation-Function Relationship

A very brief and simple derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation is given by substi-
tuting the de Broglie wave-length into the well-known equation for the propagation
of elastic wave [7]. The Schr¨odinger equation is in a sense the quantum-mechanical
translation of the relation connecting energy and momentum for a particle, the
energy and momentum being represented in this quantum language by diﬀerential
operators acting on the wave function according to the correspondence rule. When
we look back at the Schr¨odinger equation from such a point of view, we realize
that in this wave equation has been assumed the constancy of the momentum of a
particle. This is because in general ∇2ψ = i∇ · (kψ) = (i∇ · k − k2)ψ, and hence
the correspondence operation enables one to deduce the equation

Eψ = −

¯h2
2m

∇2ψ −

¯h

2mi

(∇ · p)ψ + V ψ,

(19)

from the classical Hamiltonian relation E = p2/2m + V . On the assumption that
∇ · p = 0, the translation of Hamiltonian into the operator equation results in the
Schr¨odinger equation. But when ∇ · p 6= 0, the translation leads to the Schr¨odinger

6

ψ(x) ≈

k(x) dxi,

(20)

exph±iZ x

pk(x)

equation with an additional term. The Schr¨odinger equation is therefore a special
case of ∇ · p = 0.

If the potential energy does not have a very simple form, the solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation even in one dimension is usually a complicated problem which
requires the use of approximation methods. But if the potential energy does not
vary appreciably in a distance comparable with the wave-length, one might try
a solution of the plane-wave form except that the phase now is not simply pro-
portional to coordinates. This method is called Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB)
approximation, although the general mathematical technique had been used earlier
by Liouville, Rayleigh, and Jeﬀrey [8].
It is useful in solving a one-dimensional
Schr¨odinger equation for highly excited states. It leads to the approximate wave
function

where k(x) = [2m(E − V (x))]1/2/¯h.

While the Schr¨odinger wave equation is given by using the de Broglie wave-
length in the wave equation of elastic waves, it can also be considered as originating
from the wave function of matter waves. We may thus start with the wave function
deﬁned in (4). However, starting with the wave function

ψ(x) ≈ exph±iZ x

k(x) dxi,

(21)

the wave equation is contrary modiﬁed here so that the formal analogy with classical
mechanics is actually realized. The precise translation of classical Hamiltonian into
the operator equation leads to adopt (19) as wave equation of a particle in such a
potential, and in this case the WKB approximation method itself loses its evident
physical foundation. Hence we arrive at diﬀerent results for the correlation of the
wave equation and the wave function depending upon whether we start with the
wave equation or with the wave function.

It does not seem to be a problem of choice between the two alternatives. The
lack of the correspondence of the Schr¨odinger equation to classical Hamiltonian is
in itself a defect of the formalism. Although the WKB approximation has been used
absolutely, the contrary change of wave equation itself appears to us of considerable
physical reasoning when we consider the equation of propagation of elastic waves
being altered in form in an inhomogeneous medium. In this alternative approach
the advantage is that we treat plane-wave solutions which are covariant and are
continuous at turning points.

We now consider how the probability of tunneling through a barrier can be
calculated from the present point of view. We assume that E < V (x) in the
interval between a and b. If the potential barrier is continuous at turning points,
the transmission coeﬃcient is automatically contained in the development of the
wave function and is identiﬁed itself with the action function inside the barrier.
The eﬀect of barrier penetration therefore appears as

|ψ(b)|2 ≈ e−2R b

a

κ(x) dx|ψ(a)|2

from ψ(b) ≈ eiR b

a

k(x) dxψ(a),

(22)

7

where κ(x) = [2m(V (x) − E)]1/2/¯h. Although starting points are diﬀerent, the
results of calculation are in eﬀect equivalent. The development of the wave function
with position coordinate gives rather a simple way of describing the transmission
coeﬃcient.

4 Energy Eigenvalues of Harmonic Oscillator

In the preceding section we have considered the problem presented by diﬀerential
operators that act on the wave function.
If the momentum eigenvalue is not a
constant, the second diﬀerentiation with respect to coordinate of wave function
becomes the general eﬀect of multiplication of the function by i∇ · k − k2, not
simply by −k2. This is actually so for the harmonic oscillator because its momentum
depends linearly upon the position coordinate. It is therefore necessary to review
the harmonic oscillator equation.

The linear harmonic oscillator is the one-dimensional motion of a point mass m
attracted to an equilibrium position x = 0 by a force that is proportional to the
displacement x from it. The restoring force can be represented by the potential
energy V (x) = mω2x2/2. Insertion of this in the Schr¨odinger equation for a one-
dimensional system gives the equation

−

¯h2
2m

d2ψ
dx2 +

1
2

mω2x2ψ = Eψ.

(23)

Introducing for convenience the dimensionless independent variable ξ = (mω/¯h)1/2x
and the dimensionless eigenvalue λ = 2E/¯hω, we can put the equation in the form

d2ψ
dξ2 + (λ − ξ2)ψ = 0.

(24)

The solution of this equation is facilitated by ﬁrst examining the dominant behavior
of ψ in the asymptotic region ξ → ∞. For suﬃciently large ξ it is apparent that
ψ(ξ) = e−ξ2/2 satisﬁes (24), so far as the leading terms which are of order ξ2ψ
are concerned. This enables one to ﬁnd an exact solution of (24) of the form
ψ(ξ) = H(ξ)e−ξ2/2. Substitution of this into (24) gives as the equation for H(ξ)

H ′′ − 2ξH ′ + (λ − 1)H = 0,

(25)

where primes denote diﬀerentiation with respect to ξ. The polynomial of order
n that is a solution of this equation with λ − 1 = 2n is called the nth Hermite
polynomial Hn(ξ).

We have seen the method employed in solving the Schr¨odinger equation for the
one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The procedure consists of the determination
of the form of ψ in the region of large value of ξ, and the subsequent discussion of
the behavior of ψ for ξ small. The procedure starts with the asymptotic solution
of the equation. The derivatives of the asymptotic solution give ξ2ψ − ψ, but the
second term has been neglected in the region considered. But when substituted the
resulting form of exact solution back into the Schr¨odinger equation, the derivatives
again produce an additional term that corresponds to the term neglected, the last

8

term on the left of (25). This term is a result of the asymptotic solution not ﬁtting
to the wave equation.
In principle it corresponds to an additional term which
appears in the Schr¨odinger equation as a result of ∇ · p 6= 0. Basically it is due to
the lack of the correspondence inherent in the Schr¨odinger equation to the classical
Hamiltonian relation.

As has already been remarked, the modiﬁcation is to include the term in the

Schr¨odinger equation. The Schr¨odinger equation is then put into the form

d2ψ
dξ2 + (λ + 1 − ξ2)ψ = 0.

In consequence of this equation the equation for H(ξ) becomes

H ′′ − 2ξH ′ + λH = 0.

(26)

(27)

As characteristic for the diﬀerence between (25) and (27) one can write down the
change in the energy eigenvalues

En = (n + 1/2)¯hω −→ En = n¯hω.

(28)

Written in this way, the only appeal to the oscillator problem is to accept the
energy eigenvalues of integer multiples of ¯hω in place of their half-integer multiples
involving the ﬁnite values of the ground-state energy level. We are thus led to
reconsider physical reality of the zero-point energy. Before we relate the zero-point
energy with the uncertainty principle, indeed, we need to consider whether it is
actually possible to associate any energy with the ground-state of zero photon by
means of observable quantities.

This result of the modiﬁcation may be regarded as retrogressing to the result of
the old quantum theory in a more or less artiﬁcial and intentional manner rather
then retrieving its justiﬁcation. However, the physical reasoning which leads to (19)
is so clear that the result can be justiﬁed from an ingenious consideration of corre-
spondence arguments. As support for the validity of the result one might mention
that the polynomial method proceeds here on consistent formulation. In those re-
formulation the principle of correspondence that had been lost have automatically
been restored.

The problem of the ground-state energy eigenvalue can also be discussed in
the algebraic treatment of the harmonic oscillator equation. To distinguish the
momentum operator from its eigenvalue we denote the operator by boldface type.
Let |n > be an eigenstate of H with the eigenvalue En speciﬁed by the number
of particles present in the state. A lowest energy eigenstate |0 > is deﬁned by the
energy-lowering operator p − imωx, such that

The lowest energy eigenvalue has thus been found by operating on it with its her-
mitian adjoint opeartor:

(cid:0)p − imωx(cid:1)|0 >= 0.

(29)

(cid:0)p + imωx(cid:1)(cid:0)p − imωx(cid:1)|0 >=
(cid:0)p2 + m2ω2x2 − m¯hω(cid:1)|0 >= 2m(cid:0)E − ¯hω/2(cid:1)|0 >= 0.

(30)

9

From (29) one may say that the operator p yields the same eigenvalue as the
operator imωx does. Since the operator p acts on everything that stands to the
right, repeated application of p to the energy eigenstate yields the value m¯hω
in addition to the eigenvalue p2. Taking into account the momentum operator-
eigenvalue relationship, equation (30) should be modiﬁed to

(cid:0)p + imωx(cid:1)(cid:0)p − imωx(cid:1)|0 >=
(cid:0)p2 + m2ω2x2(cid:1)|0 >= 2mE|0 >= 0.

In this regard |0 > must be an eigenstate of H with the eigenvalue zero.

(31)

In the hydrogen atom angular momentum is represented by quantum numbers
characterizing energy eigenstates. Correspondence of the Schr¨odinger equation to
Hamiltonian is therefore exact and its polynomial method is self-consistent there.

5 Conclusion

Schr¨odinger, pursuing and generalizing the notion of matter waves of de Broglie,
discovered the equation of propagation of the wave function representing a given
quantum system. But one may say that the physical representation of the wave
function itself was not until, from the Lagrangian approach of Dirac, Feynman de-
veloped the expression of Huygens’ principle for matter waves. The fundamental
point reviewed here is that the correspondence is based upon the action principle
that stays as close to the classical equation of motion as possible. From this point
of view we have reviewed the correspondence of Hamiltonian operator to its eigen-
value. Judged by a criterion of correspondence arguments energy levels of harmonic
oscillator must be En = n¯hω instead of being En = (n + 1/2)¯hω.

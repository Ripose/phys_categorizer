ABSTRACT 

We  present  the  brief  review  of  some  central  problems,  anomalies,  paradoxes  of  Astrophysics, 
Cosmology  and  new  approaches  to  its  decisions,  proposed  by  the  Wave  Universe  Concept  (WU

All these, anyhow, - Hot Points of modern science of Universe, about which Standard Model have 
not  authentic  answers.  The  represented  set  of  brief  (justified)  Novels  reflects  very  perspective 
directions of search.

All  answers,  proposed  by  the  Wave  Universe  Concept,  in  contrast  with  speculative  schemes  of 
Standard  Model,  are  effectively  verified  by  experience,  including,  -  and  by  justified  in  observations 
prognoses. 

It  will  be  waited,  that  namely  here  it  is  possible  the  real  break  in  the  understanding  of  these 

principal problems and enigmas, which Nature, infinite Universe offers (to us). 

MODERN COSMOLOGY: HOT POINTS – CHALLENGE WITHOUT ANSWER. 

The manifold, unexpected, astonishing information about the structure of the Universe, represented 
by  observations  from  Earth  and  Space,  now  is  the  real  challenge  to  human  Mind,  to  ability  of  the 
modern  theory  (in  particular,  of  the  Standard  Model  of  Cosmology)  adequately  to  understand  the 
surrounding us World. 

That  challenge  of  observations  and  experiments,  in  many  cases,  remains  without  satisfactory 

Answer. 

For  the  noneffective  theory,  which  can  not  make  the  justified  predictions  (evidently,  namely these 
are  very  essential  attributes  of  the  true  science),  every  new  significant  phenomenon  of  observations 
and  experiments  is  a  suddenness,  surprise,  reason  for  astonishment.  But  obstinantly  noninterpreting 
phenomena  usually  manifests  a  natural  tendency  to  convert  in  anomalies,  paradoxes,  becomes  Hot 
Points of science.

NEW PHENOMENON – MEGAQUANTIZATION: 
Observed Megaquantum Effects in Astronimical Systems. 
Wave Universe. Wave Astrodynamics. 

The  principle  possibility  of  dynamical  synthesis  of  the  classical  celestial  mechanics  and 
astrophysics  continual  aspects,  follows  from  the  Wave  Universe  concept  and  wave  concept  of  the 
astrodynamics - the Megaquantum wave astrodynamics (Chechelnitsky, 1980 -1997) (see Fig.1). 

Megawaves.  One  of  the  basic  ideas  of  the  Wave  Universe  concept  is  the  assertion  of  the 
existence of some waves in any megasystem (astronomical system) of Universe, in particular, in the 
Solar system. These waves actual realise short-range interactions in the scale, compared with scale of 
the system. 

The  Suggestion.  Let  us  study  the  Solar  system,  -  as  the  wave  dynamic  system  (WDS)of 
megaworld.  There  are  megawaves  (large  astronomical  scale  waves  with  large  lengths  and  periods), 
which induce, propagate, and absorbe due to the cosmic medium. These megawaves are responsible 
for  the  dynamic  structure  (and  geometry)  of  the  Solar  system  (the  co  -  dimension  principle 
(Chechelnitsky, 1980)). 
 
Micro-Mega Analogy. 

When quantum mechanics was developing, the main role in the comprehension of the microobject 

dynamic structure belonged to the analogy of the structure between the atom and planetary system. 

Apparently,  the  time  has  come  to  return  debts.  And  at  present  this  dynamic  analogy  works  vise 
versa: now astronomical (in particular, planetary) systems are studied in analogy - with atom systems 
(Fig. 1). 

Besides  the  investigation  of  Fundamental  wave  equations  (Chechelnitsky,  1980,  1986),  some 
quantitive  representations  on  megawaves  properties (if these waves are considered as some analog 

 

 

ai, aj 

of the De Broglie waves for megaworld astronomical systems) can be received, in particular, from the 
following relations of the Megaquantum wave astrodynamics:     

Here   k  - wave number, v   - velocities, W

v = d-  (cid:215) k    e  = d-  (cid:215)

    D x(cid:215)
  - circular frequency,  

D v ‡  (1/2)(cid:215) d-  

e  - normalized (divided by m -mass) energy of megawaves (e  =

dimension [cm2(cid:215) s-1]. 

The  quantization  constant  d

  =  d/2p     in  the  microworld  for  the  atom  is  determined  by  Planck's 

constant 

=h/2p  and electron mass me 
(cid:132)
d

 ~ 

/me = 1.158 cm2(cid:215) s-1 
(cid:132)
The mentioned relations above represent the megaquantum analogs of the Bohr, Planck-Einstein, 
Heisenberg  relations  well-known  in  the  microworld  quantum  mechanics,  accordingly.  It  should  be 
emphasized that, at least, in the frame of the Wave astrodynamics, the formal analog of Heisenberg 
incertainty  relation  (D x(cid:215)
  -  difractional  incertainty  relation)  does  not  have  such  a  wide 
prohibitive sense, as in the Copenhagen interpretation of microworld quantum mechanics (Born, 1963, 
Jammer, 1985).

Megaquantum World of the Solar System Distance Quantization. 

Radial Quantization. The high-precision information on the geometry (in particular, on semi-major 
axes)  of  planetary  orbits,  gives  the  possibility  to  receive  some  single-valued,  intriguing  facts.  They 
were  found  in  the  70-ies  using  the  quantum  of  (linear  size)  distance  a*  =  a*
  - radius of 
Sun)  and  caused  the  astonishment  surprise  showing  a  great  set  of  integer  numbers,  which 
characterized the dynamical structure and geometry of the Solar system (Fig. 2).

as and the                                          a(cid:217)
has a deep physical basis. Such a nonaccidental abundance of integer (semi-integer) numbers (in the 
absence of anything ad hoc fitting parameters) shows the conceal, early unknown, but really existing 
phenomenon of the Solar system wegawave structure (Chechelnitsky, 1984; 1992 b, c, Table 1) (see 
Fig. 3). 

Azimuthal  Quantization.  The  effects  of  megaquantization  (quantization  "in  the  Large")  -  the 
megaquantum  effects,  are  not  less  interesting.  They  were  discovered  for  pi  =  2p ai  perimeters  of 
planetary orbits, normalized by a*  quantum, i.e. for 

p(cid:217)

i = pi / a*  = 2p ai / a*  = 2p a(cid:217)

Azimuthal Quantization                          p(cid:217)
is  a  very  characteristic  pattern  of  the  physically  distinguished  orbits  and  it  occurs  rather  often 
(Chechelnitsky, 1992 b,c, Table 1) (see Fig.3A). 

Sectorial  Velocity  Quantization.    In  this  case  we  speak  about  the  observed  effect  of  the 

discreteness - the quantization of the dynamical value  

of the sectorial velocity, normalized by  

LN = (K(cid:215) a)1/2 = LN=1=1(cid:215) N 

LN=1 = L* /(2p )1/2, where L*

 = (K(cid:215) a*

 )1/2.

Taking  into  account  the  interpretation  of  N  quantum  number,  as  N  =  LN/LN=1,  we  can  talk  about 

integer (semiinteger) ability of the N quantum number. 

For  planetary  orbits  of  Mercury  (ME),  Venus  (V),  Earch  (E),  Mars  (MA),  we  have,  in  particular, 

N=(2p a/a* )1/2 

N = 7.911; 11.050; 12.99; 15.969,      close to integer 
N = 8;        11;        13;      16,             accordingly  (Fig. 2) (see also Fig. 3). 

At  the  definite  conceptual  supposition  this  effect  may  be  connected  with  the  well-known 

quantization effect of kinetical momentum (K(m) = mva, where m - mass) or action. 

In this aspect it has been known since the times Planck, Einstein, Bohr, De Broglie. Although, we 
should stress, that in the quantum mechanics (of microworld) the quantization namely of the kinetical 
momentum  K(m)  =  mva  was  always  discussed,  but  not  of  the  sectorial  velocity  (or  circulation)  L  = 
K(m)/m= va. 

Since Kepler's times (his second law) the notion and dynamical value of the sectorial velocity has 

taken the importance place in the astrodynamics, in space sciences. 
 
INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF CELESTIAL BODIES AND SUN. 
Where is disposes the Convective Zone? 

Results  from  Helioseismology,  periodicities  spectrum  of  the  Sun  and  stars  -  can  be  adequately 
understand  and  effectively  interpreted  only  in  the  context  of  unified  theoretical  representations.  That 
possibility is permitted the Wave Universe concept (see monograph - Chechelnitsky A.M. Extremum, 
Stability,  Resonance  in  Astrodynamics  ...,  etc.  and  consequent  publications),  which  comprehand  the  
Solar  and    any  astronomical  systems  as  the  principle  Wave  dynamic  systems  (WDS).  Investigations 
with  using  of  the  theoretically  calculated  Fundamental  Wave  spectrum  of  (periods)  those  objects,  its 
Megaspectroscopy  (Fig.  4)  (including  the  Helioseismology  -  for  the  Sun,  and  Asteroseismology  -  for 
the stars) lead to reconstruction of dynamics, physics, geometry of the Sun and stars (its internal and 
external structure) (Fig. 5).

Of course, such a problem is specially attracting and interesting, when spacecrafts Pioneer 10, 11 
and  Voyager  1,2  still  did't  achieve  the  intriguing,  significant  barrier  of  the  Solar  system  -  Heliopause 
[Abstracts COSPAR, 1994; Belcher et al., 1993; Masek, 1996]. 

Some  astrophysicists  are  strive  to  consider  the  Heliopause  as  objectively  detectable  external 
boundary  of  the  Solar  system.  But  astronomers  -  observers  will  hardly  agree  with      this  conclusion. 
Resulting  from  these  and  other,  more  fundamental  ideas,  it  will  be  reasonable  to  suppose,  that  the 

 

region beyond Heliopause also has very nontrivial properties. Just from the fact that for a long time it 
has been considered as inexhaustable reservoure of comet bodies.

Heliosphere Boundaries. Heliopause 

According to the ideas of modern astrophysics, the interaction of the Sun with interstellar medium, 
surrounding  it,  results  in  formation  of  the  Solar  system  Heliosphere  (that  in  some  sence  reminds  the 
well  investigated  Earth  magnetosphere).  Depending  on  the  chosed  parameters,  it  is  believed  that the 
bow shock, after which the Heliosphere begins, can be located at the distance 30 - 50 AU or 75 - 200 
AU. 

There are reasons to expect, that the bow shock (and inside it - the Heliopause) may be discovered 

at the heliocentric distance [Chechelnitsky, 1992 a,b,c]

The  experience  of  space  researches  of  the  Solar  system  and  satellite  systems  of  planets  (not 
depending on the succeses in far celestial bodies continuating search) show, that dominant orbits are 
physically  distinguished  states  in  many  other,  fixed  by  observations,  aspects  (for  instance,  -  in 
measurements of energetic proton count intensity, etc.) [Chechelnitsky, 1992 a]. 
 
MYSTERY OF THE FINE STRUCTURE CONSTANT (FSC). 
Microworld: Quantum Wave Mechanics and Fine Structure Constant 

From  all  modern  theories  of  microworld  -  quantum  electrodynamics  (QED)  describes  the  dynamic 

structure and the interaction of elementary particles (photons, electrons, muons) most exactly. 

There is the fundamental parameter (coupling constant, interaction parameter), that lies in the basis 

of that advanced and consistent theory - the Fine Structure Constant (FSC), [Born, 1963]. 

The theoretical representation of this constant is unknown up till now. "The Mysterious Number 137" 

- so titled Max Born the famous paper of 1936 [Born, 1936]. 

The  Fine  Structure  Constant  (FSC)  a

-1  » 137  (where  e  - 
electron charge, h - Planck constant, c - speed of the light) was introduced in the theoretical physics by 
Arnold  Sommerfeld  in  1915  [Sommerfeld,  1973].  That  is  the  fundamental  parameter  of the all atomic 
spectroscopy. At present, only its experimental value is known (a

Answer of the WU Concept: 
Theoretical Representation of the Fine Structure Constant. 

In  the  framework  of  Wave  Universe  concept  may  be  naturally  obtained  the  following  surpriselly 
simple analytical and numerical (closed) representation for the Fine Structure Constnt that is proved to 
be correct by the logics of the consistent theory [Chechelnitsky, (1986) 1996] 

-1 = 239/4/2p  = 137.0448088 

FSC – As Micro and Mega Parameter of the Universe. 
FSC, Orbits, Heliopause. 

Fine  Structure  Constant  is  fundamental  constant  not  only  of  microworld  (atoms),  but  also  –  of 

megaworld (astronomical systems) – one of the general nondimensional parameter of Universe. 
 
Megaworld: Megaquantum Wave Astrodynamics and Astrophysics; 
Earth Orbit and Heliopause 

We shall cite only one fragment of the new knowledge [Chechelnitsky, 1996], that is spontaneously 

connected with discussed theme - with wave structure, geometry and dynamics of Solar system. 

The Assertion  
*   There is regular connection between planetary orbits arrangement and special critical surface of 

Solar system - Heliopause location. 

megaparameter of astronomical systems. 

*  This connection may be presented by using the Fine - Structure Constant, that is considered as 

*  In particular, when using the Earth orbit, the following most simple relation between the Keplerian 

periods of Earth orbit TE  =1

a  and of Heliopause T* is valid: 

T* »  Sa TE »  861

a
,   Sa  = 2p /a

 »  2p

(cid:215) 137 »  861 

The  appearing  from  the  above  relation  between  semi-major  axis  of  Earth  orbit  aE  =  1  AU  and  of 

Heliopause a* is like this: 

a* »  Sa

2/3 (cid:215) aE = 90.5 AU 
These  relations  reflect  the  presence  of  spontaneous  and  close  connection  between  Wave 
astrodynamics (celestial mechanics) - geometry and dynamics of regular set of elite (dominante) Solar 
system planetary orbits - and geometry and dynamics of Heliopause (of Solar system magnetosphere, 
or of standing shock wave of Heliosphere), that is traditionally regarded as an object of astrophysics. 
 
WHAT QUASARS WITH RECORD REDSHIFTS WILL BE DISCOVERED IN FUTURE? 
Megaquantization in the Universe. 

It  is  clear,  Megaquantization  (quantization “in the Large”), observed megaquantum effects are not 

monopolic privelege of only Solar system. 

Let  us  point  the  brief  resume  of  research  (prognosis),  connected  with  problem  of  redshift 

quantization of far objects of Universe – quasars (QSO) [Chechelnitsky, (1986) 1977]: 

“Abstract: In the framework of the Wave Universe concept it is shown that the genesis of redshifts 
can  be  connected  with  the  intra-system  (endogenous)  processes  which  take  place  in  astronomical 
systems. The existence of extremal redshift objects (quasars – QSO) with most probable  

z = 3.513 (3.847); 4.677; 6.947 (7.4); 10.524; 14.7; 27.79; … 

is predicted.” 

Prognosis already had justified successively for extremal values of z redshifts  

ztheory = 3.513,      zobs = 3.53 (quasar OQ172) 
ztheory = (3.847),   zobs = 3.78 (quasar PKS2000-330) 
ztheory = 4.677,      zobs = 4.71 (Schmidt, Gunn, Schnaider, 1989) 
                            zobs = 4.694 (4.672) (quasar BR1202-0725, Wampler et al., 1996) 

At  the  present  time,  apparently,  also  the  object  Q2203+29  G73  with  record  value  z  of  redshift 

z=6.97 is discovered in special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO, Russia) 

ztheory = 6.947, zobs = 6.97 

a
 

 (Q2203+29 G73, Dodonov et al., 2000). 

The Quene – for objects with even more high redshifts z = 10.524; 14.7; … 
Consequences of such successfully realizable prognosis, imperatives of observations not only are 
unexpected  for  the  Standard  cosmology,  but  also,  probably,  its  can  stimulated  the  radical 
reconsideration of many habitual representations, having become as freezen dogmas.

MONOTONIC HOMOGENEITY AND ANISOTROPY OR PRINCIPAL HIERARCHY? 
Is the (Large – Scale) Limit of Universe exist? 

Invariablly  justified  representations  of  the  Wave  Universe  Concept  -  WU  Concept  indicate  a 
principle  incorrectness  of  expectations  of  Standard  (Model)  cosmology  about    homogeneity  and 
isotropy of the Universe. 

It also is connected with observational data about apparent hierarchy of giant astronomical systems 
(stellar  systems,  galaxies,  clusters  of  galaxies,  superclusters  of  galaxies,  etc.),  their  megawave 
structure, Megaquantization (quantization "in the Large"), non-homogeneity of microwave background 
Space radiation, adequately interpreted (in frameworks of WU Concept) effects redshifts quantization 
of quasars, etc.  

The principle absence of a Limit of Hierarchy of Matter Levels asserts: "The Staircase of a Matter" - 

is endless. 

For orientation of the explorers, working with the observational data, in frameworks of WU Concept 
the  concrete  characteristics  of  following  (behind  superclusters  of  galaxies)  potentially  possible 
extremely  large  astronomical  systems  are  calculated  with  using  the  Fundamental  parameter  of 
Hierarchy – Chechelnitsky Number c  = 3.66(6). 

The  astronomical  systems,  belonging  to  the  nearest  hierarchy  Levels  of  Solar-Like  systems,  are 

characterized by external radiuses [a(k) = c k a(0), a(0) = 39.373 AU] 

a(20) = 36.83, a(21) = 135, a(22) = 495, a(23) = 1815 Mpc. 
It may be expected that in the Universe also exist and should show itself in observations (the Solar-

Like objects) – extremely large astronomical systems (ELAS), characterized by the external radiuses 
(of peripherals) 

a(26) = 89503, a(27) = 328177, a(28) = 1203318 Mpc. 

 
FROM PARADOXES AND ANOMALIES – TO THE GREAT SYNTHESIS. 
Foreseeing Future. 

Many factors, - including megaquantum effects, manifestation of the FSC as megaparameter in the 
science of giant astronomical systems – (Mega) Wave astrodynamics, in our opinion, are symptoms, 
that  in  front  of  sciences  about  Universe  new,  (for  many,  possibly)  surprisely  representatives  are 
opening:  

Sciences about Universe are found at the Way to the Great Synthesis [Chechelnitsky, 1996-1997], 

in particular, of Substance and Medium.

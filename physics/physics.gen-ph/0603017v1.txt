Absoluteness of Velocity Caused by Accelerating Process
and Absolute Space-time Theory with Variable Scales
—–The third logically consistent and really rational space-time theory

Abstracts It is proved by means of the dynamical eﬀects of special relativity that the velocity caused by
accelerating process is not a relative concept. It is an absolute physical quantity that can be determined by
experiments. Therefore, the inﬂuence of accelerating process must be considered in space-time theory. Be-
sides the Newtonian absolute theory with invariable space-time scales and the Einsteins relative theory with
variable space-time scales, there exists the third space-time theory, i.e., the absolute space-time theory with
variable space-time scales. At present, special relativity is divided into two parts, kinematics and dynamics.
In kinematics force and acceleration are not considered so that space and time becomes relative concepts.
This division is completely artiﬁcial and irrational. The space-time theory should be established on the
foundation of dynamics consistently. As the three most fundamental physical quantities, the changing rules
of space, time and mass with speed are dependent of accelerating processes and absolute. The real meaning
of the invariability principle of high speed should be that we can not make the speed of an object with rest
mass reach and exceed the sped of light in vacuum by the method of accelerating it. But if velocity is not
caused by accelerating process, it is allowed to exceed lights speed in vacuum. For example, apparent tangent
velocities of all ﬁxed stars in sky are over lights speed. It is proved from the angle of symmetry that the
absolutely resting reference frame exists. In order to eliminate multifarious space-time paradoxes in special
relativity, and coincide with Big-bang cosmology, the absolutely resting frame is necessary. A method is put
forward to look for absolutely resting reference frame. The isotropy reference frame of cosmic microwave
background radiation can be regarded as the absolutely resting reference frame actually at present. This
absolute space-time theory with variable space-time scales is logically consistent without contradicting any
physical experiment and astronomical observation, so it can be considered as a really rational space-time
theory to describe real physics world.

1. Possibility and necessity of the third space-time theory

As we known that according to the Newtonian theory, the scales of space-time are absolute and invari-
ableindependent of the selection of reference frames. The absolutely resting reference frame was considered
to exist, though Newton did not know how to determine it. According the Einsteins theory, reversely, the
scales of space-time are relative and variable, dependent of the selection of reference frames. The absolutely
resting reference frame was considered not to exist. But velocity was always considered as a relative concept
whether in Newtonian or in Einsteins theories. However, from the angle of logical possibility, the third space-
time theory is allowed to exist besides the Newtonian and Einsteins theories. That is the absolute space-time
theory with variable space-time scales. In this theory, the scales of pace-time are variable but with absolute
signiﬁcance, independent of the selection of reference frames. Besides, velocity caused by acceleration process
can be proved to be an absolute concept by means of the dynamic eﬀect of special relativity. This result is
completely diﬀerent from the Newtonian and Einsteins theory, and leads to the existence of the absolutely
resting reference frame.

Lots of experiments show that the scales of space-time are variable, so the Newtonian space-time theory is
considered incorrect at present. Though the Einsteins theory has obtained great success, multifarious space-
time paradoxes can be deduced from it. For example, the Ehrenfests paradox, the Polevaulters paradox,
the apparent shape rapidly moving object of paradox, the stress eﬀect paradox due to length contraction,
the upper limit paradox on the proper length , the thread paradox, the right-angled lever paradox, the
superluminal velocity paradox, the Oppenheimer paradox and other recently raised paradoxes and so on
(1). But many persons denied the existence of space-time paradoxes at present. They persists on that those
paradoxes were caused only by incorrect understanding of relativity, and put forward many methods to
explain the paradoxes, most of them are ambiguous and even completely wrong. For example, in order to

explain the paradox of slide falling, the shape of slide was considered diﬀerent in diﬀerent inertial reference
frames.
In the resting frame, the shape of slide is considered to be ﬂat, but when transformed into the
moving frame, the shape of slide is thought becoming parabolas shape (2). This explanation is completely
wrong and unacceptable. An object with ﬂat shape in an inertial frame would still be the same shape in
another inertial frame. Otherwise the principle of relativity would be violated. As for the most famous twin
paradox with the existence of accelerating processes, the general theory of relativity or equivalent principle
has to be used to explain it. This paradox is considered to be solved completely at present (3). However,
the problem is not so simple. If we take more symmetrical form, this paradox is impossible to solve. For
example, we send two twins into space by two rockets at opposite directions simultaneously, and then let
them return to the earth at the same time after arbitrary period of times travel. Because the situations are
completely symmetrical for two twins, each twin would think that his brother is younger than himself if time
contraction is relative. In this completely symmetrical case, general theory of relativity is also incapable.
In fact, as we known, general theory of relativity itself also demands a certain extent of absoluteness. The
situation hints us actually that Einsteins completely relative space-time theory can not be a ﬁnal one. It is
unsuitable for us to use such a theory with so many paradoxes to describe the real world.

It is commonly thought that Einsteins space-time theory has nothing to do with acceleration. The theory
only considers the measurement relation of space-time between two inertial reference frames.
In special
relativity, two reference frames are hypothesized to be at rest each other at beginning so that same space-time
units (ruler and clock) can be deﬁned. Then by introducing a relative speed between two inertial frames, we
can deduce the Lorentz transformation formula based on the principles of relativity and invariability of lights
speed. From the Lorentz transformation, we can reach a result that space-times contractions are completely
relative. However, we meet an inevitable problem here, that is, when a relative speed is introduced into two
frames that are at rest at beginning, acceleration process is needed. At rest one of two frames has to be
accelerated. Thus, would accelerating process aﬀect space-time characteristics? According to the current
understanding at present, it is thought that the eﬀect of accelerating process can be neglected in special
relativity. The Lorentz transformation is only relative to speed and speed is considered only a relative
concept.

However, in order to eliminate time paradox in special relativity, we have to consider the eﬀect of
accelerating or non-inertial process on space-times nature. According to equivalent principle, inertial force is
equivalent to gravitation, or non-inertial reference frame is locally equivalent to gravitational ﬁeld. Because
space-time scale would change in gravitational ﬁeld, acceleration process would aﬀect space-times nature
if equivalent principle holds. In this waywe meet a logical absurdity. On the one hand, in order to keep
space-time relativity, we have to suppose that accelerating process does not aﬀect space-times nature. On
the other hand, in order to reach a proper gravitational theory, we have to suppose that accelerating process
is equivalent to gravitation and gravitation ﬁeld would aﬀect space-times nature. This kind of space-time
theory is deviant. It tells us actually that a rational space-time theory can not avoid non-inertial motions
eﬀects. Space-times scales would be connected with accelerating process (speaking strictly, both acceleration
and accelerating time).

Einsteins special relativity is divided into two parts. One is kinematics independent of force and accel-
eration. Another is dynamics relative to force and acceleration. In kinematics, various paradoxes appear
owing to velocitys relativity. In dynamics, there is no paradox because force and accelerating process are
not relative. Because the eﬀect of accelerating process is neglected, so many paradoxes appear in kinemat-
ics. It is factitious and irrational to divided special relativity into two parts. Non-inertial processs eﬀect
should be considered in rational space-time theory. We should establish space-time theory consolidate on
the foundation of dynamics. Only when the dynamic theory to describer space-times nature is established
independently, we can consider the relation between non-inertial motion and gravitation. Otherwise the
problems would entangle each other before non-inertial motions inﬂuence on space-times nature has been
known.

Therefore, we have to consider the third space-time theory with absoluteness and variable scales. Veloc-
ity caused by accelerating process is proved to be an absolute concept and the absolutely resting frame is
demanded to exist. This result coincides with modern cosmology. In fact, we can take the reference frame
which was at rest together with the original point of Big-bang universe as the absolutely resting reference
frame. All other reference frames in universe are considered to move relative to it. It seems absurd to say
that velocity is absolute for it seems to contradict with common knowledge and basic idea of physics. But
we can prove it by the eﬀect of special relativity, though it is impossible in Newtonian theory. Only when
the eﬀect of special relativity is taken into account, can we say velocity caused by accelerating process to be
absolute. We now do it by means of an idea experiment below.

2. Absoluteness and anisotropy of velocity caused by accelerating process

As shown in Fig.1, suppose there are three resting reference frames represented by K0, K1 and K2 in
vacuum in beginning. K1 and K2 are closed chambers. There are two objects A1 and A2 with same masses
in both chambers individually. Each object is connected into the left and right sides of chamber by two
elastic ropes. The nature and length of elastic ropes are the same. Then we accelerate K2 in a constant
acceleration a toward to right side, while K0 and K1 still keep at rest. After a long enough time, the speed
of K2 reaches V2 = V . According to the dynamical theory of special relativity, inertial mass of object A2
and inertial force acting on elastic rope caused by A2 are individually

m2 =

m0
1 − V 2/c2

> m0

p

F2 =

m0a
(1 − V 2/c2)3/2

(1)

Therefore, the elastic rope on the right side of object A2 would be pulled longer and longer in accelerating
process. Suppose the biggest force that the elastic rope can bear is F2, if V2 > V the elastic rope would be
pulled apart. Suppose the accelerating process is stopped when the speed of K2 just reaches V2 = V , so the
elastic rope has not yet pulled apart in this case. After that, frame K2 moves in a uniform speed V towards
right side, and elastic rope resumes to original length for it is not acted by the force (Lorentz contraction
has not been drawn out for it is unimportant in this discussion.).

Because K2 is in inertial state again, according to space-time relativity, observers in K2 would think
that their reference frame is at rest, while K0 and K1reference frames move in uniform speed V towards
left side. So according to observers in K2, the mass of object A2 is m0 and the moving mass of object A1
1 − V 2/c2 > m0. This opinion is just opposite to that of observers in K0 and K1. In the
is m1 = m0/
viewpoint of observers in K0 and K1, K1 is at rest in all time and K2 moves towards right side in uniform
speed V . So the mass of object A1 is m0 and the moving mass of object A2 is m2 > m0. Therefore, mass
becomes a relative concept for observers in two reference frames with a relative speed between them.

p

However, it can be proved that this relativity idea is actually impossible. When we want to know an
objects mass, we need to accelerate it. Then we can decide objects mass by the relation of force and acceler-
ation. As shown in Fig.2, we accelerate both K1 and K2 in a constant acceleration a towards right side for
a short simultaneously. After K1 reaches a small speed V1(0 < V1 << V ), accelerating process is stopped
and K1 and K2 resume to the states of uniform motions again. After that, relative to observers in resting
frame K0, the speed of K2 becomes V1 + V2 > V , so that the elastic rope connected to the right side of
object A2 would be pulled apart immediately, for the inertial force acted on the rope is bigger than F2. On
the other hand, because K1 is only accelerated for a short time and its speed is far small than V , the elastic
rope connected to the right side of object A1 would not be pulled apart. Because whether elastic ropes are
pulled apart or not are absolute events, observers in K1 and K2 would observe the same phenomena and
admit these facts.

Fig. 1

Fig. 2

Thus, we immediately see that the things happen in two inertial reference frames with a relative uniform
speed between them are completely diﬀerent. We can let observers in K1 and K2 are in the state of dormancy
from beginning to that K2 reaches uniform speed V , then awake them. In this case, the observers in two
reference frames do not known which one has been accelerated. After that, we accelerate K1 and K2 for
a while again. By means of the facts that the rope connected to object A2 is pulled apart, but the rope
connected to object A1 is not pulled apart, observers in both reference frames can obtain the same viewpoint
that K2 is accelerated even and obtains a speed V . Meanwhile, K1 is at rest before the second accelerating
process is carried out. There is no relativity in this case. Velocity caused by accelerating process becomes an
absolute eﬀect. It is obvious that this result violates the principle of space-time relativity in special relativity.
As we know that in Newtonian theory, objects mass does not change with speed, so rope would not be
pulled apart in the process above. It means that we can not decide which reference frame moves and which
is at rest by the same experiment according to the Newtonian theory. So in the Newtonian theory, velocity is
still a relative concept. It is just by means of the dynamical eﬀect of special relativity, the velocity produced
by accelerating process becomes an absolute physical quantity.

Thereforemoving mass of a object should be also an absolute physical quantity. When there exists a
relative speed between K1 and K2, observers in both reference frames would have the same viewpoint about
the masses of objects A1 and A2. Because K2 is accelerated, the mass of object A2 increase. Because K1
is at rest, the mass of object A1 is unchanged. There is no relativity here. The accelerating process has an
eﬀect on an objects mass. This is easy to understanding from the angle of energy conservation. Energy is
needed when a force is acted on an object and work is done. The result is that objects energy or motion mass
increases. Therefore, it is diﬀerent from traditional idea that the motion of an object has reason. The reason
comes from force and acceleration. Some observable and measurable results would be caused when the object
obtain a velocity through accelerating process. Unfortunately in the Newtonian and Einsteins space-time
theories, this point is neglected so that velocity becomes something that can be designated arbitrary without
origin.

Now let us to show that velocity caused by accelerating process is anisotropic in general. For this purpose,
lets discuss the process of decelerating K2. As shown in Fig.3, when K2 moves in a uniform speed V without
rope being pulled apart, we accelerate K2 towards left side in same acceleration a (actually decrease K2).
At beginning, the velocity of K2 is still towards to right side. After a period of time, the speed of K2 is
decreased to zero, so that three reference frames become at rest each other again. Because in whole process
the speed of K2 is always with V2 < V , the rope connected to the left side of object A2 would not be pulled
apart. Because whether the rope is pulled apart or not is an absolute event, observers in K2 would also
observer the same result and hold the same viewpoint.

Fig.3

Thus we can see immediately that the results are completely diﬀerent in both cases that K2 is accel-
erated towards right side and towards left side. When it is accelerated towards right side, the rope would
be pulled apart. But when it is accelerated towards left side, the rope would not be pulled apart. All
of observers in three frames agree with this result. So observers in reference frame K2 would think that
space is with anisotropy for him, because the results are diﬀerent when his reference frame is accelerated
towards diﬀerent directions. This result also violates the principle of space-time relativity in special relativity.

3. Nonequivalent inertial frames and absoluteness of Lorentz contractions

So we have to consider the eﬀect of accelerating process on space-times characteristics. Based on the
consideration of accelerating process, we can establish a more rational space-time theory. At ﬁrst, lets
introduce the concept of nonequivalent inertial reference frames. We call such two reference frames as

nonequivalent inertial reference frames. At beginning, these two reference frames are at rest each other and
deﬁne the same unit scales of space and time (ruler and clock). Then by accelerating one of them at least,
a motion velocity is introduced between them. After accelerating process is stopped, they become inertial
reference frames again with a relative velocity between them. That is to say, the relative velocity between
two nonequivalent inertial frames is produced by accelerating process.

In fact, all of humans common activities and scientiﬁc experiments are carried out on nonequivalent
reference frames. Most of measurements about the relation of space and time are done in nonequivalent
reference frames. For example, Michelson interferometers two arms are just nonequivalent reference frames
when we use the interferometer to verify the invariability principle of lights speed. When one of arms moves
along with the earths moving direction, another arm can be considered at rest. When the interferometer
rotates, the motion states of two arms exchange each other throuth non-inertial rotating. In fact, the earth
is just a big non-inertial system, all scientiﬁc experiments done on it involves the eﬀects of non-internal
motion. Only based on nonequivalent reference frames, the theory is meaningful. Once theory is established
on nonequivalent reference frames, absoluteness and asymmetry would be introduced.

Therefore, two foundational hypothesis of Einsteins special relativity should be revised as follows
1 Non-inertial motions would aﬀect the space-times natures of non-inertial reference frames. But the

description forms of physics laws are the same in non-inertial reference frames.

2 The speed of light in vacuum is invariable among arbitrary non-inertial reference frames.

By means of these two hypotheses, the same Lorentz transformation can also be deduced, but the
transformation is with absolute signiﬁcance now. In order to obtain the transformations, we suppose that
there are two reference frames K1 and K2 in vacuum. In the beginning they are at rest each other and the
same rulers and clocks are deﬁned. Then let K1 is still at rest and K2 is accelerated towards right side.
When the speed of K2 reaches V , accelerating process is stopped. After that, K2 moves in a uniform speed
relative to K1. Suppose at a certain moment, point x1 at K1 meets point x2 at K2. At this time, the clock
at point x1 indicates t1, and the clock at point x2 indicates t2. Meanwhile, a bind of light is send out along
the X axes of two frames. This light reaches the point x1 at time t1 relative to K1, reaches the point x2 at
time t2 relative to K2. In light of the invariability principle of lights speed between non-inertial reference
frames, we have

(x1 − x1)2 − c2(t1 − t1)2 = 0

(x2 − x2)2 − c2(t2 − t2)2 = 0

From these two equations, we can deduced the Lorentz formulas

x2 − x2 =

x1 − x1 − V (t1 − t1)
1 − V 2/c2

t2 − t2 =

t1 − t1 − V (x1 − x1)/c2
1 − V 2/c2

Suppose space and time intervals for two reference frames are △l1 = x1 − x1, △l2 = x2 − x2, △t1 = t1 − t1

and △t2 = t2 − t2 individuallywe can obtain the same Lorentz contraction formulas

p

p

△l1 = △l2r1 −

V 2

△t1 =

△t2

It shows that length becomes short and time becomes slow for reference frame K2 moving in uniform
speed V . Because the motion speed of K2 is caused by accelerating process, we should think that the real
change of space-times scales of K2 reference frame takes place owing to the eﬀect of non-inertial process.
Though the formulas of space-time contractions are relative to speed, it is only a superﬁcies. The eﬀects of
accelerating process are hided. When accelerating process stops, space-times scales are ﬁxed.

On the other hand, we let K2 at rest and accelerate K1 towards left side in the beginning. When speed

of K2 reaches −V , stop accelerating process, we obtain the conversed Lorentz transformation

x1 − x1 =

x2 − x2 + V (t2 − t2)
1 − V 2/c2

t1 − t1 =

t2 − t2 + V (x2 − x2)/c2
1 − V 2/c2

It means that the ruler become short and clock becomes slow for frame K1 moving in velocity −V .
Similarly, the changes of space-times scales caused by accelerating process are also real and absolute. Which
reference frame is accelerated, of which space-time scales are changed. So it can be seen that the premises of
Lorentz transformation formulas (3) and (5) are diﬀerent. In fact, before of Einsteins relativity explanation,
Lorentz thought that space-times contraction was absolute eﬀect owing to the motions of objects relative
to resting aether. We are used to regard reference frames as some things which are abstract and arbitrary
velocity can be endowed to. However, any practical reference frame is always composed of material with
mass. Force or interaction is always needed to accelerate a practical reference frame. But this fact is always
omitted in space-time theory.

In order to explain the relativity of length contraction, Einstein put forwarded the concept of relativity of
simultaneity. The concept claims that if two events at two diﬀerent sites of an inertial reference frame take
place simultaneously, they would not take place simultaneously for another inertial reference frame with a
relative speed. In this way, the relativity of length contraction is turned over to the relativity of simultaneity.
However, for nonequivalent inertial reference frames, there is no the relativity of simultaneity. Though the
readings of clocks located at the diﬀerent places of an accelerated reference frames are diﬀerent, the concept
of simultaneity is still absolute. For nonequivalent inertial frames, if two events take place simultaneously for
a reference frame, they also take place simultaneously for another reference frame, though the times readings
on the diﬀerent clocks of two reference frames may be diﬀerent.

On the other hand, according to this absolute and variable space-time theory, the real signiﬁcance of the
invariability principle of lights speed is that we can not let the speed of an object with rest mass reach and
exceed lights speed in vacuum by the method of accelerating it. Only in this meaning, we can consider lights
speed as a limit speed.

4. Necessity and possibility of absolute resting reference frame

As shown in Fig.4, let K0 represent absolute resting reference frame. K1, K2 and K0 are at rest in
beginning and same rulers and clocks are deﬁned for them. Then we accelerate K1 and K2 towards right
sides in accelerations a1 and a2 with a2 > a1 individually and simultaneously. When the speed of K1 reaches
V1 and the speed of K2 reaches V2, stopping accelerating processes. After that, K1 and K2 move relative
to K0 in uniform in uniform speeds V1 and V2 with V2 > V1 individually. Suppose at a certain moment,
the original points of three reference frames coordinates just meet together. The readings of clocks at three
frames original points are adjusted to t0 = t1 = t2 = 0 at this time. Meanwhile, a bind of light is send out
along the X axes. In light of the invariability principle of light speed of non-equivalent inertial frames, the
Lorentz transformations can be written as

The relative speed between K1 and K2 is

The invariability principle of lights speed between K1 and K2 still holds, but their relative speed should
be deﬁned by Eq.(9). Because of a2 > a1, V2 > V1 in this case, we should think that K2 is accelerated
relative to K1, so that the ruler and clock of K2 contract absolutely relative to K1.

Fig. 4

On the other hand, as shown in Eq.(7), when accelerated K1 moves in uniform speed V1, the clocks
located at diﬀerent places dedicate diﬀerent times. The observers in K1 can regulate these clocks so that
their time becomes the same. After that, the observers in K1 would ﬁnd that lights speed is diﬀerent from
K0. There is no lights speed invariability again between K0 and K1 in this case. If the observers in K1
accelerate another reference frame K 1 with same ruler and clock. Then stop accelerating when K 1 reaches
a certain speed. After that, there exists the invariability of lights speed and the Lorentz transformation
between K1 and K 1, but there exists no the invariability of lights speed and the Lorentz transformation
between K 1 and K0 (as well as K 1 and K2). In fact, all nonequivalent inertial reference frames on the earth
are established in this way.

The discussion above would lead to a result, that is, the absolutely resting reference frame exists. In fact
as shown in Fig.4, if we accelerate K1 towards right side so that its speed becomes faster after it obtain a
uniform speed V1, the rulers in K1 would become shorter further, the clocks would become slower further
and the mass of object would becomes greater further. Oppositely, if we accelerate K1 towards left side so
that its speed becomes slower after it obtains a uniform speed V1, the rulers in K1 would become longer
and the clocks would become quicker and the masses of objects would become smaller. When the speed of
K1 becomes zero relative to the absolutely resting reference frame K0, the rulers are longest, the clocks are
quickest and the masses of objects are smallest. If we continue to accelerate K1 towards left side, the rulers
in K1 would become short and the clocks would become slow and the masses of objects would become great
again.

It is obvious that only the space-time of absolutely resting reference frame is isotropy. The rulers are
longest, the clocks are quickest and masses are smallest in the absolutely resting reference frame. No other
frames have such characteristics. So from the angle of symmetry, we can always ﬁnd out such a reference
frame, in which space-time is completely isotropy. We can do it by accelerating a reference frame in diﬀerent
directions in space, and observer the changes of ruler, clock and objects mass in the frame. If experimental
results are isotropy at a certain state, the reference frame in this case can be regarded as the absolutely
resting reference frame.

A simple method is provided here to determine the absolutely resting reference frame. Because objects
moving mass is the smallest in the absolutely resting reference frame (equal to its rest mass), as long as we
ﬁnd out a reference frame in which a objects mass is smallest, we can think that this reference frame is just
the absolutely resting one. The concrete method is below. A chamber such as shown in Fig. 1.1 is ﬁxed in a
rocket. An object is connected to a sensitive spring. Then we accelerate the rocket in a constant acceleration
in diﬀerent directions in space. The spring would be pulled long by the inertial force caused by the object.
Measure the lengths change of spring accurately by optical method. If we ﬁnd that the length of spring is
the shortest at a certain moment, stopping accelerating rocket. Then the rocket would move in a uniform
speed in space. In this case, all inertial reference frames which are at rest with the rockets can be regarded
as the absolutely resting reference frames.

The existence of absolutely resting reference frame coincides with the demand of modern cosmology and
practical observations of astronomy. In the 1960s, astronomers found the special anisotropy of microwave
background radiation (4). If the isotropic reference frame of microwave background radiation is taken as the
absolutely resting one, astronomic observations shown that earth frame was moving in a speed of V ≤ 300
Meters/s towards to the direction of right ascension 0 ∼ 13h. This velocity could be regarded as the velocity
that the earth moves relative to the absolutely resting reference frame. In 1999, the anisotropy detector
of microwave background radiation (WMAP) found anisotropy at higher precision. In 2002, two physicists
in Oxford University found the anisotropy of radio waves eradiated by radio galaxy in the earths motion
direction by using array radio telescopes (VLA) (5). This kind of anisotropy is considered to be caused by
the Doppler eﬀect of the earths motion. Any more, the Big-bang cosmology demands the existence of the
absolutely resting reference frame. We can take the reference frame which is at rest with the original point
of Big-bang universe as the absolutely resting reference frame. The other reference frames produced by
accelerating in the Big-bang processes would be considered to move relative it. It seems at present that the
isotropic reference frame of microwave background radiation may be taken as the absolute resting one.

5. Equivalent inertial reference frames and possibility of over light speeds motion

We deﬁne reference frames as equivalent inertial reference frames that relative velocities between them
exist primordially, not be caused by accelerating processes. That is to say, there exist no relative resting
states between equivalent inertial frames from beginning to end, so that they can not deﬁne same rulers and
clocks at resting states. The deﬁnitions of rulers and clocks in equivalent inertial frames can be independent.
These kinds of inertial reference frames, of cause, are completely equivalent. Because such equivalent inertial
frames may have no any causality, they are not restricted by the invariability principle of lights speed in
vacuum.
In fact, all moving reference frames produced by the Big-bang processes can not be equivalent
inertial frames, and relative moving velocities between them can not pass over lights speed in vacuum. But
if there are some celestial bodies which were not produced through the Big Bang processes of our universe,
relative velocities between our universal celestial bodies and these celestial bodies can be allowed to pass
over lights velocity in vacuum.

On the other hand, for non-inertial reference frames, some apparent relative velocities may be allowed
to pass over lights velocity when these velocities are not caused by accelerating processes. For example, the
tangent velocities of all ﬁxed stars in space exceed lights speed observed by observers on the rotating earth.
But no observers on the earth ﬁnd that the ﬁxed stars diameters become zero even imaginary number. If we
build a uniformly rotating disc on the earth, as long as the angle speed of disc reaches ω ≥ 1/480, the tangent
speed of the sum would reach and pass over lights speed. But the diameter of the sum is almost unchanged
for the observers on the disc. All these facts can not be explained by Einsteins special relativity. But it can
be explained well by this papers theory. This is because that the sum and ﬁxed stars have not ever been
accelerated, so their diameters do not contract. It is that the rotating disc is accelerated ever, so it is that
tangent length of disc contracts. So we only can say that the rotating earth and disc are moving, instead of
the sun and ﬁxed stars. By using the ruler in the rotating disc to measure, the diameters of the sum and
ﬁxed stars would become longer, instead of shorter, for the ruler becomes shorter. Though the change is
very small when the tangent speed of disc is very small with V = rω << c. Meanwhile, all observers on
the earth, sun or ﬁxed stars have the same viewpoint on motion and velocity, there is no relativity. In fact,
energy needed to accelerate a ﬁxed star is completely diﬀerent from that to accelerate a disc. This kind of
asymmetry would cause some measurable eﬀects.

It should be emphasized again that the invariability principle of lights speed only means that the speed
of an object with rest mass can not reach and exceed lights speed in vacuum by means of the method
of accelerating it. The reason to cause lights speed invariable is that the space-time scales of non-inertial
reference frame change really in accelerating process, so that the observers in the non-inertial frame ﬁnd that
lights speed is still unchanged. In fact, so-called lights speed invariability is conditional. For example, in
medium, lights speed is variable. It depends on mediums refractive index. When refractive index is big than
1, the speed of light in medium is smaller than its speed in vacuum. This is a well-known fact in physics.
If some day we ﬁnd that a certain mediums refractive index is small than 1, it needs not to surprise that
lights speed in this medium would pass over its speed in vacuum. In fact, some authors declaimed in 2000
that they had found the phenomena of over-lights speed in atom Cs gas (6).

In sum, because velocity caused by accelerating process can not be relative, we have to abandon the
principle of relativity, while the invariability principle of lights speeds between non-inertial reference frames
are hold. We should establish space-time transformation theory based on the non-inertial reference frames.
In this way, we can reach an absolute space-time theory with variable space-time scales. This kind of theory
has no any logical contradiction and confusion. It does not contradict with any present physical experiments
and astronomic observations, and also coincides with modern cosmology. So it can be considered as a really
rational space-time theory to describe this real physics world.

Abstract

Starting with the premise that the electric charge associated with fun-
damental fermions (quarks and leptons) can, under certain circum-
stances, be appropriately represented as a real internal 2-vector, the
mathematical “machinery” implicit in the associated internal 2-space
is shown to apply to all fundamental fermions.
In particular, it is
shown that ﬂavor eigenstates, ﬂavor doublets and families of funda-
mental fermions can all be represented in the 2-space, and that such
things as internal colors, family replication, and the observed number
(three) of families, are more-or-less implicit in the new 2-space de-
scription. Moreover, the model predicts that, unlike the case in the
standard model, particles such as the u, c and t quarks are character-
ized by signiﬁcant internal (topological and other) diﬀerences. Similar
diﬀerences may help explain recent observations of (nearly) maximal
νµ − ντ mixing.

1 Introduction

If quantum eﬀects are ignored it is completely appropriate to treat elec-
tric charge in external spacetime as a scalar quantity. In particular, in 4-
dimensional spacetime, the electric charge carried by an isolated particle is
appropriately treated as a Lorentz invariant 4-scalar [1]. However, when

1

quantum eﬀects are taken into account it is not at all clear that the internal
description of electric charge should be limited to scalar quantities. The pur-
pose of this paper will be to argue that in the case of fundamental fermions
(quarks and leptons) there are good reasons for treating electric charge as a
vector quantity associated with a new (abstract) internal 2-space [2]. The
motivation for taking such an unusual step is that it will be shown to lead
to an extension of the standard model description of quarks and leptons.

Before embarking on this exploration, it is appropriate to brieﬂy review
the conventional description of ﬂavor doublets of fundamental fermions. Cer-
tain aspects of the conventional description via the SU(2) isospin formalism
will suggest the new description.

1.1 The conventional description of ﬂavor doublets

According to the standard model of particle physics, all left-handed quarks
and leptons (right-handed antiquarks and antileptons) are members of SU(2)
weak isospin doublets [3]. To be speciﬁc let us limit the present discussion
to the ﬁrst-family quark states |ui and |di, which constitute an SU(2) weak
isospin doublet (also called a ﬂavor doublet). These states are properly to be
thought of as being two diﬀerent (isospin) states of a single quark ﬁeld [4].
Using the conventional isospin language, there exists an isospin (vector)
operator τ = 1
σ, where σ = (σ1, σ2, σ3) is a vector form whose components
2
are the familiar Pauli matrices σ1, σ2 and σ3. All physically observable states
carrying (weak) isospin (e.g., |ui and |di) must be simultaneous eigenstates
of the square of the total isospin vector τ 2 = τ 2
3, and the third-
component of isospin τ3, i.e., they take the form |τ 2, τ3i. The states |ui and
|di are said to span a two-dimensional Hilbert space, and to constitute a
2-dimensional representation D(1/2) of SU(2). In particular, given that the
states |ui and |di are eigenstates of

2 + τ 2

1 + τ 2

where

(cid:18)
we have the eigenvalue equations (use τ 3|τ 2, τ3i = τ3|τ 2, τ3i or τ 3| 3

2 i and/or the column-vector forms |ui = {1, 0} and |di = {0, 1})

Now the electric charge of the quark ﬁeld in either of the states |ui or |di
is given by operating on these states with the operator for electric charge,
which may be expressed in this particular case as

Then we have for the electric charges of these two possible states of the quark
ﬁeld

are the speciﬁc electric charges in question.

While the foregoing description is certainly correct as far as it goes it
is, nevertheless, unnecessarily restrictive. In particular, we will show in the
next section that the foregoing properties of ﬂavor doublets are suggestive of
a (complementary) extension of this conventional description, which treats
electric charge as a real vector quantity in a new internal 2-dimensional linear
vector space.

1.2 Electric charge as a vector quantity

It is implicit in the description of SU(2) isospin doublets that if one knows
the state |ui one can (must) infer the existence of a second state |di, and
vice versa. The 2 × 2 matrix form of the charge operator QQQ, and the isospin
operator τ 3 makes this abundantly clear.

3

If one has a state with τ3 = + 1

2, and one knows that one is dealing with
an SU(2) isospin doublet ﬁeld, then one must also have a state with τ3 = − 1
2 .
As a consequence of these simple facts, one can have simultaneous knowledge
of the two electric charges q1 and q2 associated with the two states |ui and
|di, respectively, given either one of the states |ui or |di.

In a certain sense then, there could be a physical meaning to a geomet-
ric object deﬁned by the ordered pair of observable (real numbers) electric
charges associated with the states |ui and |di, namely, a real 2-vector or
“charge vector”

Q = {q1, q2}.

(8)

However, it should be stressed that if the 2-vector Q were to be “carried” by,
or “associated” with, each of the states |ui and |di there would be deﬁnite
nontrivial physical consequences.

Clearly, the assignment of Q to |ui and |di would mean that these states
carry additional information (besides isospin) in the quantum sense [5]. In
particular, because the 2-vector Q has to “live” in some abstract internal
2-space, all of the mathematical “machinery” associated with this 2-space
would have to be taken into account (e.g., the 2-space metric and various in-
ternal transformations in the 2-space) when describing fundamental fermions.
In short, this new description would promise a far richer internal structure
than that implied by the description of ﬂavor doublets using SU(2) alone.
This implied richness constitutes nothing less than a possible extension of
the standard model [3, 6], and encourages us to seriously consider the idea
of representing electric charge (of fundamental fermions) by an internal 2-
vector.

In the next section we will show how this idea leads naturally to, among
other things, an explanation for ﬂavor doublets in other families, i.e., to an
explanation for family replication.

2 Consequences of Treating Electric Charge

as a 2-Vector

In this section we derive a number of consequences of applying the 2-space
mathematical machinery to fundamental fermions. Many of the results pre-
sented here were arrived at in earlier works by a somewhat diﬀerent route.

4

In particular, in [7] we began by generalizing the scalar fermion number f to
a 2 × 2 real, generally non-Hermitian matrix F (i.e., f → F), and in [8] we
arrived at this same matrix F by analytically continuing the fermion number
operator F(op) → F.

In the present paper, by contrast, we begin by generalizing electric charge
(call it e) from a scalar to a 2-vector Q (i.e., e → Q) or “charge vector.”
Only later do we arrive at the matrix F described above. The interested
reader is encouraged to consult the indicated references for further details
regarding these earlier works.

2.1 The 2-space metric

If the 2-vector Q = {q1, q2} is assigned to each of the matter states |ui and
|di, then there must exist a vector (call it Qc) that is assigned to each of the
corresponding anti-matter states |ui and |di, respectively.

Recalling the deﬁnition of the charge vector Q given in Sec. 1.2 (see
Eq. 8), the (anti) charge vector Qc must be formed in some way from the
ordered pair of real numbers −q1 and −q2 corresponding, respectively, to
the electric charges of the |ui and |di antimatter states. Now, assuming
that the scalar product of Q and Qc, namely, Q · Qc should vanish (Q
and Qc should be orthogonal) so as to insure that matter and antimatter
states can be distinguished in the 2-space, it follows that no matter what
the metric is, as long as it is real and ﬂat, Q and Qc must also be linearly
independent. To see this, notice ﬁrst that if Q and Qc are not linearly
independent, then they are, by deﬁnition, necessarily, linearly dependent, in
which case Qc = −Q = {−q1, −q2}.

Assuming that the 2-space metric g is real and ﬂat, g can be represented

by the 2 × 2 matrix g = (g11 = 1, g22 = s, g12 = g21 = 0) or

g =

1 0
0 s

,

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(9)

where |s| = 1. Then, given A · B =

gijaibj, where A = (a1, a2) is a row-

i,j=1
vector and B = {b1, b2} is a (conformable) column-vector, the scalar product
P
of Q and Qc = −Q (Note that q1 is never equal to q2 because these charges
correspond to diﬀerent eigenstates of the electric charge operator QQQ; see Eqs.

5–7) is, from (8) and (9),

Q · Qc = (q1, q2)

= −q2

1 − sq2
2,

(10)

−q1
−q2 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

which is generally nonzero for any |s| = 1, i.e., s = ±1 (also see Footnote 9).
Therefore, if Q and Qc are to be orthogonal (Q · Qc = 0), the fact that (10)
is generally nonzero ensures that Q and Qc must be linearly independent. In
this case, given Q = {q1, q2}, it must be true that

Qc = {−q2, −q1},

(11)

which is not proportional to Q, as required to ensure linear independence.

Finally, given the general form for the metric (9), and the linear indepen-

dence (and orthogonality) of Q and Qc, one has the following result for s

Q · Qc = (q1, q2)

= −q1q2 − sq1q2 = 0,

(12)

(cid:18)
if, and only if, s = −1. Therefore, the 2-space metric is given by

−q2
−q1 (cid:19)

g =

(cid:18)

1
0
0 −1

,

(cid:19)

and we see that the requisite 2-space is, necessarily, “Lorentzian” or non-
Euclidean [10].

2.1.1 Scalar products of 2-vectors

Using the metric given in (13), and the general formula for A·B given in Sec.
2.1, we immediately have the scalar product of two diﬀerent real 2-vectors

Similarly, the square of a real 2-vector is given by

(a, b){e, f } = ae − bf.

(a, b){a, b} = a2 − b2.

For example, using (8), (11) and (15) we immediately have the square of

the 2-vectors Q and Qc, namely,

and

Therefore,

Q2 = Q · Q = q2

(Qc)2 = Qc · Qc = q2

1.

Q2 = −(Qc)2,

(16)

(17)

(18)

which means that Q2 and (Qc)2 each transform like C-reversing 2-scalar
charges [9].

It happens that these particular charges can be identiﬁed with the baryon-
or lepton-number carried by quarks or leptons, respectively (see Ref. 7, p.
72). We will see in a later section that when charge vectors such as Q (or Qc)
are resolved in the 2-space into pairs of linearly independent vectors (e.g.,
Q = U + V), not only are the components of Q, U and V, C-reversing
charges, but also given

Q2 = U2 + 2U · V + V2,

(19)

U2, 2U·V and V2 are, like Q2, C-reversing charges. The foregoing collection
of 2-scalar charges will be used to deﬁne and describe ﬂavor eigenstates, ﬂavor
doublets, and eventually families of fundamental fermions.

2.1.2 A conjectured “duality”

Given the number of ﬂavors of quarks and leptons, and an appropriate
(renormalizable) Lagrangian, the so-called “accidental symmetries” of the
Lagrangian [11] are known to “explain” the separate conservation of vari-
ous (global) ﬂavor-deﬁning (Lorentz 4-scalar) “charges” [e.g., lepton num-
ber, baryon number, strangeness, charm, the third-component of (strong or
global) isospin, truth, beauty, electron-, muon-, and tau-numbers]. Now, as
demonstrated in detail in Ref. 7, pp. 67–71, given certain real C-reversing
scalars—components of various vectors and matrices deﬁned on the inter-
nal non-Euclidean 2-space, and various scalar products of 2-vectors—it is
possible to describe the ﬂavor eigenstates of fundamental fermions [12].

7

In principle, what one does is to identify the mutually-commuting C-
reversing 2-space “charges” (call them Ci) or charge-like quantum numbers
associated with a particular ﬂavor, and then write the corresponding simul-
taneous ﬂavor-eigenstate as

|C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cni.

(20)

Here C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cn, are said to be the “good” charge-like quantum num-
bers (charges) associated with a particular ﬂavor [13]. Now it also happens
that these observable real numbers can be identiﬁed with quantum numbers
such as electric charge, lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, charm,
the third-component of (strong or global) isospin, truth and beauty (see Ref.
7, p. 72). In short, these 2-space charges look very much like those associated
with the aforementioned “accidental symmetries” of the Lagrangian! The
foregoing properties of the non-Euclidean charge-like scalars, leads naturally
to the following “duality” conjecture:

The global (ﬂavor-deﬁning) charges associated with the “accidental sym-
metries” of the Lagrangian describing strong and electroweak interactions,
and the global (ﬂavor-deﬁning) charges associated with the non-Euclidean
2-space, are (essentially) one and the same charges.

2.2 Charge conjugation in the 2-space

Given that there are numerous C-reversing scalars in the 2-space (see Sec.
2.1.1), there must exist a 2 × 2 matrix, call it X, that serves to transform
these scalars, various 2-vectors such as Q or Qc, and various 2 × 2 matrices,
to their corresponding C-reversed (2-space) counterparts.
In particular, a
matrix X should exist such that (use Eqs. 8 and 11)

and

From (21) and (22) it follows that X must equal its multiplicative inverse
(X = X−1), and thus

(21)

(22)

(23)

XQ = Qc

XQc = Q.

X2 = I2,

8

where I2 is the 2 × 2 identity matrix.

Write X in the general form (X is real)

X =

a b
c d

,

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

and consider the situation where one of the two charges (say q2) associated
with Q = {q1, q2} is zero, and the other charge (q1) is nonzero (this is actually
the case for leptons).

In this particular case, we have (use Eqs. 8, 11, 21 and 24)

which means that

And therefore, since q1 6= 0, it must be true from (26) and (27) that a = 0

and c = −1.

Since XQc = Q it must also be true that

d = 0.

Collecting the foregoing matrix elements, we have

X = −σX,

(32)

where σX or σ1 is one of the familiar Pauli matrices. In general, the matrix
X = −σX should apply (in the 2-space) to 2-scalars, 2-vectors, 2×2 matrices,
and to both quarks and leptons.

2.2.1 Transformation of the metric and other matrices under X

Any 2 × 2 matrix M, appropriate to the 2-space description of fundamental
fermions, should transform under X = −σX to its C-reversed counterpart
Mc according to the similarity transformation

or because X = X−1 = −σX, equivalently as

For example, the metric g (see Eq. 13) is found to be C-reversing since

A matrix that is C-invariant (e.g., the matrix X) would, necessarily, have

the form

where it is clear that

Now let us apply the foregoing similarity transformation to the matrix F,
which represents the generalized fermion number in this 2-space [see Ref. 7,
pp. 4–12].

X M X−1 = Mc,

(−σX)M(−σX) = Mc.

(37)

2.3 The generalized fermion number F(v)

There are other 2 × 2 matrices besides X that act on the 2-vectors Q and
Qc. Let us deﬁne a matrix F whose eigenvalues f are the fermion numbers
fm = +1 for matter, and fa = −1 for antimatter, and whose eigenvectors are
the electric-charge vectors Q and Qc, respectively. Then

FQ = fmQ

FQc = faQc.

and

and

Clearly, (38) and (39) require F to be equal to its multiplicative inverse, i.e.,
F = F−1 or F2 = I2.

Given that the eigenvalues of F are fm and fa, the diagonal form for F

is simply (see Ref. 7, p. 4)

And, from (31) and (33) the C-reversed counterpart of Fdiag is, necessarily,
given by the similarity transformation

Fdiag =

fm 0
0

.

fa (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(−σX)Fdiag(−σX) = −Fdiag.

From the minus sign on the right hand side of (41) we see that the scalar
fermion numbers fm and fa properly change signs (are C-reversing “charges”)
under −σX.

Consider next a more general (nondiagonal) matrix F. Because the trace,

determinant and square of F are invariants, one has

And, because F is traceless it must have the general form

trF = trFdiag = fm + fa = 0
detF = detFdiag = fm · fa = −1

F2 = F2

diag = I2.

F =

11

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)
(43)

(44)

(45)

Finally, because F should transform in the same way as Fdiag under X =

−σX we have the similarity transform

(−σX)F(−σX) = −F.

Using F as expressed by (45) and employing (46), one ﬁnds that c = −b.
Hence, the most general form of F is, necessarily,

F =

b
a
−b −a

,

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
where a2 − b2 = 1 since detF = −1.

Making the following substitutions in (47), namely,

and

a = cosh v

b = ± sinh v,

where −∞ ≤ v ≤ +∞ is a real (dimensionless) parameter in the range
indicated, F or F(v) ﬁnally assumes the general form

F(v) =

(cid:18)

cosh v, ± sinh v
∓ sinh v, − cosh v

.

(cid:19)

Here, F2(v) = I2 for any v, F(v) satisﬁes the boundary condition F(0) =
Fdiag, and the non-Euclidean 2-scalars Q2 and (Qc)2 are left invariant by
the transformation F(v).

2.4 Distinguishing quarks and leptons

Choosing the upper signs in (50), the matrix F(v) becomes

F(v) =

(cid:18)

cosh v
− sinh v − cosh v

sinh v

,

(cid:19)

where v is also chosen to be a positive real number (see Ref. 7, p. 50 and 54).
As described in Ref. 7, pp. 52–55, the parameter v distinguishes between
quarks and leptons. In particular, the parameter v is found to be quantized
and obeys the “quantum condition”:

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

v = ln Mc,

12

where Mc counts both the number of fundamental fermions in a strongly-
bound composite fermion, and the strong-color multiplicity. That is, Mc =
3 for quarks (strong-color triplets) and Mc = 1 for leptons (strong-color
singlets). Thus we have found that a connection exists between the 2-space
description of quarks and leptons, and their associated strong colors!

2.4.1 Quark and lepton electric charges and B and L

It has been shown (see Sec. 2.3, Eqs. 38 and 39; Ref. 7, pp. 52–55, and Ref.
8) that the quark and lepton electric charges are the “up”-“down” compo-
nents of the eigenvectors of the matrix F(v) speciﬁed by (51) and (52). In
particular, the quark charges are given by (Mc = 3)

q1(f ) =

In summary, the new 2-space description, and F(v), is found to provide an
explanation for the quark-lepton “dichotomy” of fundamental fermions in ad-
dition to the matter-antimatter, and “up”-“ down” type ﬂavor-dichotomies.

2.5 Representing ﬂavor doublets in the 2-space

Consider again the eigenvectors Q of F(v) for fundamental fermions. Since
the space on which F(v) “acts” is two-dimensional, an observable vector Q
can be “resolved” into two (no more or less) observable, linearly-independent
vectors, call them U and V, as Q = U + V [14]. Now, because these three
vectors (Q, U, and V) are simultaneous observables, it makes sense to speak
of this “triad” of vectors as being a well deﬁned geometric object, namely, a
“vector triad.”

(54)

(56)

13

Recognizing that the components of Q, U and V are C-reversing charge-

like observables [13] we can write these observable “charge” vectors as

(57)
(58)
(59)

(60)
(61)
(62)
(63)

(64)

where q1, q2, u1, u2, v1 and v2 are the various observable “charges” (e.g.,
q1 and q2 are the electric charges). Given Q = U + V, the non-Euclidean
metric (13), and Eqs. (57) through (59), we ﬁnd the associated observable
quadratic-“charges” [13]

Q = {q1, q2}
U = {u1, u2}
V = {v1, v2},

Q2 = U2 + 2U • V + V2

2U • V = 2(u1v1 − u2v2)

U2 = u2
V2 = v2

1 − u2
2
1 − v2
2.

Finally, using the foregoing collection of (global) ﬂavor-deﬁning charges, we
can express the two quantum states (simultaneous ﬂavor-eigenstates) associ-
ated with a single vector-triad in the form of “ket” vectors as follows (Ref.
7, pp. 16–18)

|q1, u1, v1, Q2, U2, 2U • V, V2i
|q2, u2, v2, Q2, U2, 2U • V, V2i ) .

Here, the state |q1, u1, v1, Q2, U2, 2U•V, V2i represents the “up”-type ﬂavor-
eigenstate, and |q2, u2, v2, Q2, U2, 2U • V, V2i represents the corresponding
“down”- type ﬂavor-eigenstate in a ﬂavor doublet of fundamental fermions
[12, 15].

2.6 Family replication and the number of families

In Ref. 7, pp. 39–49 and pp. 59–65, it is shown that ﬂavor doublets (hence
families) are replicated and that there are only three families of quarks and
leptons. We refer the reader to [7] for a full and detailed account. Here we
simply outline how this situation comes about.

Once again, by the deﬁnition of a linear-vector 2-space, a 2-vector such as
Q can always be resolved into a pair (no more, or less) of linearly-independent

14

vectors U and V as Q = U + V (see Sec. 2.5). And, since Q represents a
ﬂavor doublet, so should U and V represent this same ﬂavor doublet. But,
if this is so, diﬀerent vector-resolutions of Q (i.e., diﬀerent vector-triads)
should correspond to diﬀerent ﬂavor-doublets having the same Q. In other
words, ﬂavor doublets should be replicated.

Since Q can be resolved (mathematically) in an inﬁnite number of ways,
we might suppose that there are an inﬁnite number of ﬂavor doublets, and
hence, families. But, because of various “quantum constraints,” it is possible
to show that Q can be resolved in only three physically acceptable ways for
Q-vectors associated with either quarks or leptons. In other words, there can
be only six quark ﬂavors and six lepton ﬂavors, which leads to the (ex post
facto)“prediction” of three quark-lepton families.

2.7 New internal diﬀerences and neutrino mixing

It is important to understand that the new 2-space description of fundamen-
tal fermions (quarks and leptons) provides a distinction between these par-
ticles that goes beyond diﬀerences that can be explained by mass diﬀerences
alone. For example, in the standard model the only diﬀerence between the u,
c and t quarks is that they have diﬀerent masses. Otherwise, these particles
experience identical strong and electroweak interactions. Moreover, as de-
scribed in Section 2.1.2, the separate conservation of quantum numbers such
as “charm” and “truth” can be attributed to certain unavoidable “accidental
symmetries” associated with the (renormalizable) Lagrangian describing the
(strong) interactions of these particles [11].

Taken at face value, these accidental symmetries would seem to imply
that there are no internal “wheels and gears” that would distinguish a u
quark from a c quark, for example. But, if the string theories are correct,
these particles would be associated with diﬀerent “handles” on the compact-
iﬁed space (see Ref. 16, Vol. 2, p. 408), and so would be diﬀerent in this
additional sense. Likewise, in the present non-Euclidean 2-space description,
topological diﬀerences in addition to a variety of (global) 2-scalars, which are
only indirectly related to the accidental symmetries of the Lagrangian, serve
to provide further distinctions between matter particles.

A possible experimental signal of such “internal” diﬀerences is to be found
in the recent observations at the Super Kamiokande of bi-maximal neutrino
mixing [17]. Models which begin by positing a neutrino mass-matrix and
associated mixing-parameters, such as the three-generation model proposed

15

by Georgi and Glashow [18], do an acceptable job of describing the observa-
tions. However, bi-maximal mixing may have a deeper explanation in terms
of internal topological diﬀerences (in the non-Euclidean 2-space) between νe,
and νµ or ντ neutrinos.

With respect to the internal transformation F(v), the topology of the
non-Euclidean “vector triad” (see Sec. 2.6, Ref. 7, p. 57, Ref. 20, and the
qualifying remarks in Footnote 19) representing the νe (νµ or ντ ), is found
to be that of a cylinder (M¨obius strip). And, assuming that a change in
topology during neutrino mixing is suppressed by energy “barriers,” or other
topological “barriers” (e.g., one cannot continuously deform a doughnut into
a sphere), while neutrino mixing without topology-change is (relatively) en-
hanced, one can readily explain the experimental observation of (nearly)
maximal νµ − ντ neutrino mixing—at least maximal νµ − ντ mixing over
long distances, where the proposed topological inﬂuences are expected to be
cumulative [19, 20]. If this qualitative explanation is basically correct, then
it follows that the neutrino mass-matrix and associated mixing-parameters
needed to explain bi-maximal neutrino mixing, would be the result, at least
in part, of these deeper (internal) topological diﬀerences between neutrinos,
and not their cause.

3 Summary and Conclusions

By insisting that the electric charge associated with SU(2) ﬂavor doublets,
(i.e., weak isospin doublets) of fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons)
can be treated as a real, internal 2-vector, considerations of self consistency
dictate that all of the mathematical “machinery” associated with the lin-
ear vector 2-space (e.g., the metric, and various transformations) must be
brought to bear when describing fundamental fermions. While this math-
ematical machinery is very simple, its application to fundamental fermions
immediately leads to a (modest) extension of the standard model description
of quarks and leptons, and to a number of predictions.

The model predicts, among other things, that unlike the situation in the
standard model [3, 6], particles such as the u, c and t quarks are charac-
terized by signiﬁcant internal (topological and other) diﬀerences. Similar
diﬀerences may help explain recent observations of (nearly) maximal νµ − ντ
mixing [17–20]. Moreover, while we began this paper with the introduction
of an SU(2) ﬂavor doublet of “quarks” |ui, |di and their antiparticle coun-

16

terparts (see Sec. 1.0), very little else was assumed about quarks, leptons,
internal (strong) colors or family replication. And yet, the subsequent 2-
space description correctly predicts that all of these things, and more, are
properties of fundamental fermions. For example, to maintain compatibil-
ity with the standard model, we were forced to (tentatively) conclude that
certain global “charges” associated with the “accidental symmetries” of the
Lagrangian describing strong and electroweak interactions, and various 2-
space charges, are (essentially) one and the same charges (see the “duality”
conjecture in Sec. 2.1.2). Finally, family replication emerged here as little
more than the number of diﬀerent physically acceptable ways (three physi-
cally acceptable ways are predicted) the vector Q for quarks and leptons can
be resolved in the 2-space (see Sec. 2.6 and Ref. 7, pp. 39–49) into pairs of
linearly independent “basis” vectors U and V (i.e., Q = U + V).

In closing it should be pointed out that popular extensions of the standard
model such as the so-called realistic (free fermionic) three-generation string
models [21, 22], also provide an “explanation” for family replication and the
number of families. Does this mean that in spite of very signiﬁcant and
obvious diﬀerences there are, nevertheless, “deep” connections between the
proposed 2-space description and string theories?

I thank R. Zannelli for pointing out a problem with the existing 2-space
description of muons (see Tables II and IV, and p. 57 in Ref. 7). This problem,
together with my proposed “remedy,” are brieﬂy described in [19].

If the 2-vector Q = {q1, q2} characterizes the SU(2)-doublet of states |ui
and |di, this same 2-vector must also characterize the states |ui and |di,
individually. That is, each of the states |ui and |di may be said to “carry”
the vector Q. It is important to understand that while the assignment
of an electric-charge vector Q to each of the two quark states |ui and |di
adds information in the quantum sense, it does so in a way that does not
violate quantum mechanics or special relativity. An analogous situation
involves the isospin vector τ (see Sec. 1.1 in the main text). Note that
the vector Q is analogous to the vector τ in the sense that a single
vector τ , like Q, may be assigned to each of the quark states |ui and
|di. Moreover, τ 2 and τ3 are Lorentz 4-scalars that serve to (partially)
deﬁne the states |ui and |di via the states |τ 2, τ3 = 1
2 i,
respectively. Similarly, the states |ui and |di are (partially) deﬁned by
the Lorentz 4-scalars Q2, q1 and q2 via the states |Q2, q1i and |Q2, q2i,
respectively. Here, it happens that Q2 provides additional information
(i.e., the baryon number B = Q2) on the states |ui and |di.

description of SU(2) ﬂavor-doublet states such as |ui and |di by incor-

that the added “richness” associated with the new 2-space description,
not only incorporates many features of the standard model, but also
leads to features that lie outside the domain of the standard model, i.e.,
to features that eﬀectively extend the standard model.

the many successes of the standard model of particle physics, the ob-
served proliferation of matter-ﬁelds, in the form of “replicated” gen-
erations or families, is a major unsolved problem. This book proposes
a new organizing principle for fundamental fermions, i.e., a minimalis-
tic “extension” of the standard model based, in part, on the Cayley-
Hamilton theorem for matrices. In particular, to introduce (internal)
global degrees of freedom that are capable of distinguishing all observed
ﬂavors, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is used to generalize the familiar
standard-model concept of scalar fermion-numbers f (i.e., fm = +1 for
all fermions and fa = −1 for all antifermions). This theorem states that
every (square) matrix satisﬁes its characteristic equation. Hence, if fm
and fa are taken to be the eigenvalues of some real matrix F(v)—a “gen-
eralized fermion number”—it follows from this theorem that both f and
F(v) are square-roots of unity. Assuming further that the components
of both F(v) and its eigenvectors are global charge-like quantum observ-
ables, and that F(v) “acts” on a (real) vector 2-space, both the form
of F(v) and the 2-space metric are determined. The 2-space is found
to have a “Lorentzian” or non-Euclidean metric, and various associated
2-scalars are found to serve as global ﬂavor-deﬁning “charges,” which
can be identiﬁed with charges such as strangeness, charm, baryon and
lepton numbers etc.. Hence, these global charges can be used to describe
individual ﬂavors (i.e., ﬂavor eigenstates), ﬂavor doublets and families.
Moreover, because of the aforementioned non-Euclidean constraints, and
certain standard-model constraints, these global charges are eﬀectively-
“quantized” in such a way that families are replicated. Finally, because
these same constraints dictate that there are only a limited number of
values these charges can assume, it is found that families always come
in “threes.”

[9] Note that if Qc = −Q, then (Qc)2 = (−Q)2 no matter what the metric
is (i.e., s = ±1). That is, if Qc = −Q, (Qc)2 and Q2 are the same
for matter and antimatter, so they do not transform like charges, and
consequently do not distinguish between matter and antimatter.

[10] The term “non-Euclidean geometry” is usually reserved for the geometry
of curved spaces. However, to avoid confusing the ﬂat “Lorentzian” 2-D
geometry (and discrete transformations therein) with the ﬂat Lorentzian
4-D geometry of spacetime (and continuous transformations therein), we
prefer to use a term other than “Lorentzian” to describe the 2-space.
In particular, because this 2-space is not Euclidean, we choose to break
with tradition, and refer to this ﬂat space as being “not-Euclidean,” or
more correctly, non-Euclidean.

[12] When weak interactions are “turned oﬀ” ﬂavor eigenstates and mass
eigenstates are one and the same. For the most part, when we speak
here of ﬂavor eigenstates, we are referring to the situation where ﬂavor
eigenstates and mass eigenstates are the same.

[13] It is important to point out that the various C-reversing 2-scalars as-
sociated with the internal 2-space description are taken to be Lorentz
4-scalars in an external spacetime setting. That is, because q1 and q2 are
Lorentz 4-scalars in 4-D spacetime, the components of the 2-vectors U
and V, and the scalar products Q2, U2, V2, U · V are also Lorentz 4-
scalars. This connection strengthens the idea that these numbers deﬁne
ﬂavors.

[14] When we say that the vectors Q, U and V are observables, we mean
that their associated component-“charges” are mutually-commuting si-
multaneous observables. Hence, all of these charge-like components can
be known in principle, at the same time, meaning that the vectors Q, U
and V can be known simultaneously. Thus the vector “triad” (Q, U, V)
is a well deﬁned geometric object.

[15] In Section 2.4 in the main text, it is shown that strong colors are more-or-
less implicit in the 2-space description of quarks and leptons. However,
the detailed connections between the 2-space and SU(3) color, have yet
to be worked out. And, because each ﬂavor doublet of quarks or lep-
tons is also a weak isospin doublet, there are other weak colors (i.e.,

20

weak isospin and weak hypercharge) that must be taken into account.
Strictly speaking, then, besides the speciﬁcation of global charges, the
overall quantum state of a fundamental fermion would, necessarily, in-
volve a speciﬁcation of the spin state, the energy-momentum state and
so on, together with a speciﬁcation of the particular mix of local color
(gauge)-charges R, W , B, G and Y carried by each fundamental fermion.
This color-mix would be determined, in turn, by something like a com-
plementary, local SU(5) color-dependent gauge description.

[19] With the possible exception of one family, all quarks and leptons within
a given family are found to exhibit the same topology with respect to F.
This is certainly the case for the ﬁrst and third families. And, because
of these facts, together with the requirement of quark-lepton “univer-
sality,” at least within any given family, we naturally expect this to be
the case for the second family as well. It happens that the second-family
c and s quarks exhibit M¨obius topology with respect to F. However,
strictly speaking, the second-family leptons, namely, the muon and its
associated neutrino (and associated antiparticles) exhibit the requisite
M¨obius topology only if the components of the associated V-vectors are
not exactly zero (see p. 57, and Tables II and IV in Ref. 7). Or, to
put it another way, the associated U-vectors must fall slightly inside
the physical lepton quadrant (quadrant II) of the 2-space (see Ref. 7,
Chapter 3 and Sec. 4.2.2). Therefore, if we wish to maintain a kind of
quark-lepton “universality” within families, we must assume that some
physical mechanism exists, which ensures that the V-vector components
associated with muons, though predicted to be very small, rarely if ever
actually equal zero. This assumption might be justiﬁed in a more fun-
damental treatment where (hypothetical) quantum ﬂuctuations (of the
V-vector components) are taken into account. Such a proposal is en-
couraged by the fact that (small ) ﬂuctuations of this kind would have

21

no eﬀect on the topology of other quarks and leptons, simply because
their associated V-vector components are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
zero to begin with (see Tables II and IV in Ref. 7).

Equation (11) in this paper describes a hypothetical situation in which
topology-maintaining (topology-changing) inﬂuences in three-ﬂavor neu-
trino mixtures are dominant (nonexistent). Because the matrix element
a[b = (1 − a)/2] in equation (11) assumes its largest [smallest] possible
value, namely unity [zero], the matrix element a[b = (1 − a)/2] is taken
to be a pure measure of topology-maintaining [topology-changing] inﬂu-
ences in general. Hence, the product f (a) = ab = a(1 − a)/2 is taken
to be a pure measure of the balance between topology-maintaining and
topology-changing inﬂuences. This balance should occur at the maxi-
mum of f (a), namely, when a = 1
2. Given this “equilibrium” value of
the matrix element a, one easily establishes that the (predicted) matrix
describing long-distance three-ﬂavor neutrino (equilibrium) mixtures is
given by

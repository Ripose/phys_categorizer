Abstract

We consider the recent description of elementary particles in terms
of Quantum Mechanical Kerr-Newman Black Holes, a description which
provides a rationale for and at the same time reconciles the Bohm-
hydrodynamical formulation on the one hand and the Nelsonian stochastiic
formulation on the other. The Boson-Fermion divide is discussed, and
it is pointed out that in special situations, anomalous statistics, rather
than Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac states, can be encountered.

1 Introduction

In a recent model[1, 2] Fermions, in particular the electrons have been treated
as, what may be called Quantum Mechanical Kerr-Newman Black Holes
(QMKMBH), a treatment that leads to a successful interpretation of several
hitherto inexplicable features, both in Particle Physics and Cosmology[3, 4,
5, 6]. In the hydrodynamical formulation these QMKNBH can be considered
to be vortices bounded by the Compton wavelength in a description that
leads to a harmonious convergence with Nelson’s stochastic theory also[7]
(Cf.Discussion). In this picture, Bosons would be, not vortices, but rather
streamlines[8].
In what follows, we shall show that within this framework it is possible to
explain the divide between Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, as also
examine special situations where there would be fractal statistics, that is
Bosonisation of Fermions and Fermionisation of Bosons.

2 Usual Statistics

We ﬁrst observe that the above vortex and streamline description provides
an explanation for the Fermionic and Bosonic statistics. Indeed, let nK be
the occupation number for the energy or momentum state deﬁned by K.
For Fermions nK = 0 or 1, where as nK can be arbitrary for Bosons. The
reason is that Fermions are bounded by the Compton wavelength. That is,
they are localised, a description which requires both negative and positive
energy solutions[9], which infact is expressed by zitterbewegung eﬀects. The
localisation in space automatically implies an indeterminacy of energy or
momentum K. Thus, though an energy or momentum state, in practical
terms implies a small spread ∆K, it is not possible to cram Fermions which
also have a momentum energy interdeterminacy spread, arbitrarily into this
state.
On the other hand Bosons are not bound by the Compton wavelength vor-
tices, and so have sharper momentum states, so that any number of them
can be crammed into the state K (which really is blurred by the Uncertainity
Principle indeterminacy of ∆K). Another way of expressing these facts are
by saying that the Fermionic wave function in space is weak, but not the
Bosonic wave function[10], the latter fact being symptomatic of a ﬁeld or an
interaction.
The above considerations immediately follow from a recent description in
terms of quantized fractal space time[11]. In this case we have a non com-
mutative geometry given by

[x, y] = 0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h[1 + l2]

(1)

It is precisely the space quantiza-
where l is the Compton wavelength.
tion at the Compton scale that leads to the Dirac matrices and their anti-
commutation relations.
Bosons on the other hand would be bound states of the Fermions (Cf.[12] and
other references), or alternatively they would be a super position of vortices
leading to a streamline like description[8].

3 Fractal Statistics

However there could be certain special situations in which the above space
localised and momentum space localised description of Fermions and Bosons
gets blurred, in which case anomalous or fractal statistics would come into
play. This could happen, for example when the Compton wavelength l of the
Fermion becomes very small, that is the particle is very massive. In this case
the non commutativity of the geometry referred to above in (1) disappears
and we return to the usual commutation relations of non relativistic Quan-
tum Mechanics, that is a description in terms of the spinless Schrodinger
equation. Indeed in this case, v being the velocity of the particle v/c would
be small and the Dirac equation tends to the Schrodinger equation[9].
There would thus be a Bosonisation eﬀect. This would also be expected at
very low temperatures, for example below the Fermi temperature, when the
energy spread of the Fermions would itself be small, rather as in the case of
Bosons and anomalous behaviour, for example on the lines of the superﬂuid-
ity of He3[13] can be expected.
For very light Fermions, for example Neutrinos, the Compton wavelength be
very large, but in this case the double connectivity of the QMKNBH dis-
appears and the observed anomalous features of the Neutrino show up, as
discussed elsewhere[1, 14].
Indeed with recent developments in nano technology and thin ﬁlms, we are
able to consider one dimensional and two dimensional Fermions, in which
case, Bosonisation eﬀects show up as discussed elsewhere[13]. In any case
in the one dimensional and two dimensional cases, the Dirac equation be-
comes a two component equation, without an invariant mass[15], while at
the same time, handedness shows up[16]. It is worth mentioning here that
the Dirac matrices can have only even dimensionality, corresponding to the
above anomalous two component Dirac spinors, and the usual Dirac bispinors
of the three dimensional theory.
We now consider in greater detail two illustrative situations where anomalous
behaviour shows up.
1. Nearly Mono Energetic Fermions (Cf.[17]):
Our starting point is the well known formula for the occupation number of
a Fermion gas[18]

(2)

¯np =

1

z−1ebEp + 1

3

where, z′ ≡ λ3

v ≡ µz ≈ z because, here, µ ≈ 1 (Cf. Appendix);

v =

V
N

b ≡ (cid:18) 1

KT(cid:19) ,

2π¯h2
m/b

, λ = vuut
and X ¯np = N

(3)

Let us consider particular a collection of Fermions which is somehow made
nearly mono-energetic, that is, given by the distribution,

n′
p = δ(p − p0)¯np

(4)

where ¯np is given by (2).
This is not possible in general - here we consider a special hypothetical sit-
uation of a collection of mono-energetic particles in equilibrium which is the
idealization of a contrived experimental set up. For example, the following
is a mono energetic equilibrium distribution function:

f αexp[−ρ(|~v| − |~v0|)2], ρ ≡ m/2KT >> 1,

Infact one can show that the above function is consistent with the Bolitzmann
equation for a collection of particles under a uniform magnetic ﬁeld ~B: Infact

∂f
∂t

= 0,

while one can easily show that

~∆f = 0, ~∆~v[exp[−ρ(|~V | − |~V0|)2]α[(|~V | − |~V0|)f ~V ]

Further the force is given by

~F α~V × ~B

so that the force term in the Boltzmann equation viz.,

~F
m

· ~∆~vf α~V × ~B · ~V = 0

Finally
∂f
∂t = 0 means dH

dt = 0 that is ( ∂f

∂t )coll = 0

4

Thus the above distribution function which becomes mono energetic for λ >>
1 satisﬁes the Boltzmann equation (Cf.ref.[18]); when ρ → ∞ we get the
above n′
By the usual formulation we have,

p in this case.

N =

V

¯h3 Z d~pn′

p =

¯h3 Z δ(p − p0)4πp2¯npdp =

4πV
¯h3 p2

0

1

z−1eθ + 1

(5)

where θ ≡ bEp0.
It must be noted that in (5) there is a loss of dimension in momentum space,
due to the δ function in (4) - infact such a fractal two dimensional situation
would in the relativistic case lead us back to the anomalous behaviour already
alluded to[19]. In the non relativistic case two dimensions would imply that
the coordinate ψ of the spherical polar coordinates (r, ψ, φ) would become
constant, π/2 infact. In this case the usual Quantum numbers l and m of
the spherical harmonics[20] no longer play a role in the usual radial wave
equation

d2u

dr2 +( 2m

¯h2 [E − V (r)] −

l(l + 1)

r2 ) u = 0,

(6)

The coeﬃcient of the centrifugal term l(l + 1) in (6) is replaced by m2 as in
Classical Theory[21].
To proceed, in this case, KT =< Ep >≈ Ep), so that, θ ≈ 1. But we can
continue without giving θ any speciﬁc value.
Using the expressions for v and z given in (3) in (4), we get

(z−1eθ + 1) = (4π)5/2 z ′−1
p0

; whence

′−1A ≡ z

z

′−1  (4π)5/2

p0

− eθ! = 1,

where we use the fact that in (3), µ ≈ 1 (Cf.Appendix).
A number of conclusions can be drawn from (7). For example, if,

A ≈ 1, i.e.,

p0 ≈

(4π)5/2
1 + e

5

(7)

(8)

where A is given in (7), then z′ ≈ 1. Remembering that in (3), λ is of the
order of the de Broglie wave length and v is the average volume occupied
per particle, this means that the gas gets very densely packed for momenta
given by (8). Infact for a Bose gas, as is well known, this is the condition for
Bose-Einstein condensation at the level p = 0 (cf.ref.[18]).
On the other hand, if,

A ≈ 0(that

is

(4π)5/2

e

≈ p0)

then z′ ≈ 0. That is, the gas becomes dilute, or V increases.
More generally, Equation (7) also puts a restriction on the energy (or mo-
mentum), because z′ > 0, viz.,

A > 0(i.e.p0 <

(4π)5/2

e

)

But

ifA < 0, (i.e.p0 >

(4π)5/2

e

)

then there is an apparent contradiction.
The contradiction disappears if we realize that A ≈ 0, or

p0 =

(4π)5/2

e

(9)

(corresponding to a temperature given by KT = p2
2m ) is a threshold momen-
tum (phase transition). For momenta greater than the threshold given by (9),
the collection of Fermions behaves like Bosons. In this case, the occupation
number is given by

0

¯np =

1

z−1ebEp − 1

,

instead of (2), and the right side equation of (7) would be given by ′ − 1′
instead of +1, so that there would be no contradiction. Thus in this case
there is an anomalous behaviour of the Fermions.
The Bosonic behaviour of Fermions can be understood in a simple way from
a diﬀerent standpoint. Let us consider the case described before equation
(5), of a collection of Fermions with m >> 1, and consequently all having
nearly the same momentum ~p. In this case, it is possible to choose a Lorentz

6

frame in which all the particles are nearly at rest, i.e.,v/c ≈ 0. As mentioned,
it is known that the Dirac equation describing spin 1/2 particles goes over
into the Schrodinger equation describing spinless particles[9]. Eﬀectively, we
have a collection of Bosons.

2. Degenerate Bosons:
We could consider a similar situation for Bosons also (Cf.[22] where an equa-
tion like (4) holds. In this case we have equations like (8) and (9):

p0 ≈

(4π)5/2
1.4e − 1

p0 ≈

(4π)5/2

e

(10)

(11)

((11) is the same as (9), quite expectedly). At the momentum given by (10)
we have a densely packed Boson gas rather as in the case of Bose Einstein
condensation. On the other hand at the momentum given by (11) we have
inﬁnite dilution, while at lower momenta than in (11) there is an anomalous
Fermionisation.
Finally it may be pointed out that at very high temperatures, once again the
energy - momentum spread of a Bosonic gas becomes large, and Fermioni-
sation can be expected, as in indeed has been shown elsewhere[23]. In any
case at these very high temperatures, we approach the Classical Maxwell
Boltzmann situation.

4 Discussion

1. It was mentioned in Section 1 that in the QMKNBH description there is a
reconciliation between Nelson’s stochastic theory and the Bohm-Hydrodynamical
approach, once it is realized that the diﬀusion constant of Nelson’s theory
is related to the Compton wavelength, and that the non local Bohm po-
tential gives the energy of the particle (Cf.[1, 7] for details). Infact in the
Nelsonian theory, space time is a non diﬀerenciable manifold, there being a
Double Weiner process which leads to the usual solinoidal velocity given by
~v = ~∇S
~∇R
R where the Quan-
tum Mechanical wave function ψ = Re
¯h S. We get identical expressions in

m as also an osmotic velocity given by ~u = ¯h

ı

2m

7

the Bohm-hydrodynamical approach also.
Indeed if there were no double
Weiner process, then in the Nelsonian theory ~u would vanish and so would
∇2R and Q, that is the Compton wavelength vortex and the mass and the
energy of the particle would both disappear.
2. Interestingly in the QMKNBH-Hydrodynamical vortex picture as in the
usual Quantum Theory of addition of angular momentum, we can recover the
fact that the sum or bound state of two such vortices or spin half particles
would indeed give Bosons.
This can be seen as follows, from the theory of vortices[24]. The velocity
distribution is given by

v = Γ/2πr

(12)

In the case of the QMKNBH vortex we have to use in (12) v = c
¯h/2mc, the Compton wavelength of the particle. So we have Γ = h
also the diﬀusion constant of Nelsonian Theory.
If we consider two parallel spinning vortices separated by a distance d, then
the angular velocity is given by

and r =
m which is

ω =

Γ
πd2

whence the spin of the system turns out to be h, that is in usual units the
spin is (1), wth states ±1.
There is also the case where the two above vortices are anti parallel. In this
case there is no spin, but rather there is the linear velocity given by

v = Γ/2πd

This corresponds to the spin 1 case with state 0.
Together, the two above cases give the 3, −1, 0, +1 states of spin 1 as in the
Quantum Mechanical Theory.
It must be noteed that the distance d between vortices could be much greater
than the Compton wavelength scale, so that the wave function of the Boson
in the above description would be extended in space in comparison to the
Fermionic wave function, as pointed out in the text.

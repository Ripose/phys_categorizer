Abstract

We research the natural causality of the Universe. We ﬁnd that the equation of
causality provides very good results on physics. That is our ﬁrst endeavour and success in
describing a quantitative expression of the law of causality. Hence, our theoretical point
suggests ideas to build other laws including the law of the Universe’s evolution.

1 Introduction

The motivation for our theoretical study of problem of causality comes from three sources.
The ﬁrst is due to physical interest: what is the cause of all? The second is from a story
happened about non-Euclidean geometry. And the last one is our review of the four basic
concepts: time, space, matter and motion.

1.0.1 Cause of all

If the World is in uniﬁcation, then it must be uniﬁed by connections of causality, and the
uniﬁcation is to be indicated only in that sense.

According to that spirit, contingency, if there is really something by chance, is only

product of indispensably.

Since the World is united in connections of causality, nothing of the World exists
outside them, we can divide the World into two systems: A comprises all of what are
called causes, and B all of what are called eﬀects.

Eliminating from two systems all alike elements, we thus have the following possibili-

ties:

1. Both A and B are empty, i.e. there are not pure cause and pure eﬀect. In other

words, the World have no beginning and no end.

2. A is not empty, but B is. Thus, there is an existence of a pure cause. The World

have a beginning but no end.

have no beginning but an end.

3. A is empty, but B is not. There are no pure cause but a pure eﬀect. The World

4. Both A and B are not empty. The World have both a beginning and an end.

And only one of the four above possibilities corresponds with the reality. Which

possibility is it and what is the fact dependent on?

If the World is assumed as a unity system comprising causes and eﬀects, any eﬀect
must be a direct result of causes which have generated it, and these causes also had been
eﬀects, direct results of other causes before, etc. – there is no eﬀect without cause.

A mystery motivation always hurries man to search for causes of every phenomenon
and everything. Idealistic ideology believes that an absolute ideation, a supreme spirit, or
a Creator, a God,... is the supreme cause, the cause of all. Materialistic ideology thinks
that matter is the origin of all, the ﬁrst one of all. That actuality is in contradiction.

If it is honesty to exist a supreme cause, then one must be the diﬀerence!

Indeed, if there were no existence of diﬀerence, there would not be any existence of
anything, including idealistic ideology with its ideation, spirit and materialistic ideology
with its material facilities. Brieﬂy, If there were no diﬀerence, this World did not exist.

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

3

But, if the diﬀerence is the supreme cause, namely the cause of all causes, then it must

be the cause of itself, or in other words, it also must be the eﬀect of itself.

We have recognized the existence of diﬀerence, it means that we have tacitly recognized
indeed, you could not be idealist if you now are materialist;

its relative conservation:
anything, as long as it still is itself, then cannot be anything else!

1.1 A story happened in geometry

Let us return an old story: a matter of argument about the axiomatics of Euclid’s geom-
etry.

Still by the only mystery motivation people always thirst for searching out “the
supreme cause”. The goal here is humbler, it is restrained in geometry, and the ﬁrst
to realize that was Euclid.

Euclid showed in his Elements how geometry could be deduced from a few deﬁni-
tions, axioms, and postulates. These assumptions for the most part dealt with the most
fundamental properties of points, lines, and ﬁgures. His ﬁrst four assumptions has been
easily to be accepted since they seem seft-evident, but the ﬁfth, the so-called Euclidean
postulate, incited everybody to suspect its essence: “this postulate is complicated and
less evident”.

For twenty centuries geometers tried to purify Euclid’s system by proving that the
ﬁfth postulate is a logical consequence of his other assumptions. Today we know that this
is impossible. Euclid was right, there is no logical inconsistency in a geometry without
the ﬁfth postulate, and if we want it we will have to put it in at the beginning rather than
prove it at the end. And the struggle to prove the ﬁfth postulate as a theorem ultimately
gave birth to a new geometry – non-Euclidean geometry.

Without exception, their eﬀorts only succeeded in replacing the ﬁfth postulate with
some other equivalent postulate, which might or might not seem more self-evident, but
which in any case could not be proved from Euclid’s other postulates either.

By that way they aﬃrmed that this problem had solved, Euclid’s postulate was just an
axiom, because the opposite supposition led to non-Euclidean geometry without immanent
contradiction.

But... whether such a conclusion was accommodating?

While everybody was joyful because it seemed that everything was arranged all right
and the proposed goal had been carried out: minimized quantity of geometric axioms
and puriﬁed them, whimsically, a new axiom was intruded underhand into: Lobachevski’s
axiom – this axiom and Euclid’s ﬁfth excluded mutually!

Nobody got to know clearly and profoundly how this contradiction meant. But contra-
diction is still contradiction, it brought about many arguments and violent opponencies,
even grudges.

Afterwards, since Beltrami had proved correctness of Lobachevski’s geometry on pseu-

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

4

dosphere – an inﬁnite two-space of constant negative curvature in which all of Euclid’s
assumptions are satisﬁed except the ﬁfth postulate, the situation was made less tense.

If non-Euclidean geometers, from the outset, since setting to build their geometry, de-
clared to readers that objects of new geometry were not Euclidean plane surface but pseu-
dosphere, not Euclidean straight line but line of pseudosphere, maybe nobody doubted
and opposed at all!

What a pity ! or it was not a pity that nothing happened such a thing?

But an actual regret was: the whole of problem was not what was brought out and

solved on stage but what - its consequence - happened on backstage.

Because, even if non-Euclidean geometry was right absolutely anywhere, it meant:
with the same objects of geometry – Euclidean plane surface and straight line – among
them, nevertheless, there might be coexistence of two forms of mutually excludible rela-
tionships which were conveyed in Euclid’s axioms and Lobachevski’s axioms.

It was possible to allege something and other as a reason for forcing everybody to
accept this disagreeableness, but that fact was not faithful. Here, causal single-valuedness
was broken; here, relative conservation of diﬀerence was confused white and black; there
was a danger that one thing was other and vice versa.

The usual way to “prove” that a system of mathematical postulates is self-consistent
is to construct a model that satisﬁes the postulates out of some other system whose
consistency is unquestioned.

Axiomatic method used broadly in mathematics is clear to bring much conveniences,
but this method is only good when causal single-valuedness is ensured, when you always
pay attention on order not to take real and physical sense away from considered subjects.
Brought out forms of relationships of objects as axioms and deﬁed objects - real owners
of relationships, it is quite possible that at a most unexpected causal single-valuedness is
broken and contradiction develops.

Because what we unify together is: objects are former ones, their relationships are

corollaries formed by their coexistence, but is not on the contrary.

If we have a system of objects and we desire to search for all possible relationships
among them by logically arguing method, perhaps at ﬁrst and at least we have to know
intrinsic relationships of objects.

Intrinsic relationships control nature of objects, in turn nature of objects directs pos-
sible relationships among them and, assuredly, among them there may not be coexistence
of mutually excludable relationships.

Intrinsic relationship, according to the way of philosopher’s speaking, is spontaneous-
ness of things. Science today is in search of spontaneity of things in two directions: more
extensive and more elementary.

Now return the story, as we already stated, the same objects themselve of Euclid’s

geometry had two forms of mutually excludable relationships, how is this understood?

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

5

It is only possible that Euclid’s axiomatics is not completed yet with the meaning
that: comprehension of geometrical objects is not perfected yet. Euclid himself had ever
put in deﬁnitions of his geometrical objects, but modern mathematicians have criticized
that they are “puzzled” and “heavily intuitive”. According to them, primary objects of
geometry are indeﬁnable and are merely called points, lines, and sufaces, etc. only for
historic reason.

But, geometrical objects have other names: “zero”-, “one”-, “two”-, and “three”-
dimensional spaces (“zero”-dimesional space, thai is point, added by the author to com-
plete a set).

We can ask that, could the objects self-exist independently? If could, why would they

relate together?

Following logical course of fact, we realize that conceptions of objects are developed
from experience which is gained by practical activities of mankind in nature, but which
is not innate and available by itself in our head. (Therefore, we should not consider them
apart from intuition, should not dispossess of ability to imagine them, how reasonless that
is!).

Acknowledging at deeper level, we can perceive that no all of geometrical objects may
exist independently, but any n-dimensional space is intersection of two other spaces with
dimension higher one (n + 1).

Thus, it seems that we have deﬁnitions: point is intersection of two lines;

line is
intersection of two surfaces; surface is intersection of two volumes, and volume... of what
is it intersection?

However, in a geometry, by human imaginable capability, they are evident to be inde-

pendent objects, and for convenience, we call them spatial entities.

Simplest geometrical objects are homogeneous entities. They are elements, speaking
simply, in which as transferring with respect to all their possible degrees of freedom, it is
quite impossible to ﬁnd out any inner diﬀerence.

Objects of Euclid’s geometry are a part of a system of homogeneous entities. If we
build an axiomatics only for this part, it is clear that this axiomatics is not generalized.
An axiomatics used for homogeneous spaces is just one for spherical surface2. Euclid’s

geometry is only a limited case of this generalized geometry.

For spherical surface, that is homogeneous surface in general, there exists a following
postulate: any two non-coincident “straight” lines (“straight” line is homogeneous line
dividing the surface that contains it into two equal halves) always intersect mutualy at
two points and these two points divide into two halves of each line.

It is possible to express further: any two points on a homogeneous surface belong to
only a sole “straight” line also on that surface if they do not divide this line into two
equal halves.

2The surface of a sphere is a two-dimensional space of constant positive curvature.

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

6

Applying this postulate for Euclidean plane surface as a limited case, we realize imme-
diately that it is just the purport of the ﬁrst Euclidean axiom: through two given points
it is possible to draw only a sole straight line. Indeed, any two points in an investigated
scope of Euclidean plane surface belong to only a sole “straight” line since they do not
divide this line that contains it into two equal halves.

So we can say that the mode of stating the ﬁfth Euclidean postulate was inaccurate
from the outset, because any two “straight” lines on a given homogeneous surface al-
ways intersect mutually at two points and divide into two halves of each other. In any
suﬃciently small region of the surface it would be possible to ﬁnd either only one their
intersectional point and the other at inﬁnity or no point - they are at inﬁnities. In this
case these two “straight” line are regarded to be parallel apparently with each other.

Equivalent stating the ﬁfth postulate, after correcting in the sense of above comment,

is quite possible to be proved as a theorem.

There is a very important property of spatial entities that: any spatial entity is pos-
sible to be contained only in other spatial entity with the same dimension and the same
curvature, or with higher dimension but no higher curvature.

This seems to be awfully evident: two circles with diﬀerent curvatures are impossible
to be contained in each other; a spherical surface with any curvature is impossible to
contain a circle with lower curvature...

Similarly, two spaces with diﬀerent curvatures are impossible to contain in each other.
Curvature, here, is correspondent to any quantity characterized by inner relationship of
investigated object.

1.2 Contradiction generated based on diﬀerence is dynamic power

of all

In essence, the Nature is a system of positive actions and negative actions.

What has the Nature thus positive actions on and negative actions on?

Those secrets are explored and discovered by science more and more and in searching,

if not counting its dynamic source, logical argument plays a great role.

But what we call logic is true not a string of positive actions and negative actions with

all orders?

Because thought is only a phenomenon of the Nature, the law of positive actions and
negative actions of thought is also the law of positive actions and negative actions of the
Nature. In other words, the law of actions of the Nature is reﬂected and presented in the
law of actions of thought.

This law is that: what without immanent contradiction is in positive action by itself,

what with immanent contadiction is in negative action by itself.

Positive action (if looking after the process) and negative action (if looking back upon

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

7

the process) both have an ultimate target which is coming to and closing with a new
action.

Let us take a class of similarly meaning concepts such as: having, existence, con-
servation, and positive action. In opposition to them, another class includes: nothing,
non-existence, non-conservation, and negative action.

They belong among the most general and basic concepts, because in any phenomenon
of the Nature: sensation, thinking, motion, and variation, etc. there are always their
presences.

But it turned out to be that the powers of two classes of concepts are not equivalent

to each other (and that is really a lucky thing!).

Let us now establish a following action, called A action:

“Having all, existing all, conserving all, and acting positively on all.”

And an another, called B action, has opposite purport:

“Nothing at all, non-existing all, non-conserving all, and acting negatively on all.”

Acting positively A action is acting negatively B action, and vice versa.

B action says that:

– ‘Nothing at all’, i.e. not having B action itself.

– ‘Non-existing all’, i.e. not existing B action itself.

– ‘Non-conserving all’, thus B action itself is not conserved.

– ‘Acting negatively on all’, this is acting negatively on B action itself.

Brieﬂy, B action contains an immanent contradiction.

It acts negatively on itself.
Self-acting negatively on, B action auto-acts positively on A action. It means that: there
is not existence of absolute nihility or absolute emptiness, and therefore, the World was
born!

And A action acts on all, including itself and B action, but B action self-acts negatively

on itself, so A action has not immanent contradiction.

Thus, in the sphere of A action all what do not self-act negatively on then self-act

positively on.

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

1.3 What is the most elementary?

There are four very important concepts of knowledge that:
motion.

time, space, matter, and

They are diﬀerent from each other, but is it true that they are equal to each other

and they can co-exist independently?

Let us start from time. Is it an entity? Could it exist independently apart from space,
matter, and motion? Evidently not! Just isolated time out of motion, the conception of
it would be no longer here, time would be dead. And the conception of motion has higher
independence than time’s.

So time is not the ﬁrst. It could not self-exist, it is only consequence of remainders.

Motion is not the ﬁrst either. It could not self-exist apart from matter and space. In

fact, motion is only a manifestation of relationship between matter and space.

Thus, one of two remainders, matter and space, which is the most elementary? which
is the former? or they are equal to each other and were born by one more elementary
other? Perhaps setting such a question is unnecessary, because just as time and motion,
matter could not exist apart from space. For instance, a concrete manifestation of matter,
it exists not only because of itself but also because of simultaneous existence of space
which surrounds it (and contains it) so that it is still itself.

Clearly, matter is also in spatial category and it is anything else if not the space with

inner relationships diﬀerent from those of usual space that we know?!

But now, according to the property of spatial entities raised in the previous subsection,
this fact is contradiction: two same dimensional spaces of diﬀerent curvatures (inner
relationships) are impossible to contain in each other!

Thus, either we are wrong: it is evident to place coincidentally two circles of diﬀerent
radii in each other or the Nature is wrong: diﬀerent spaces can place in each other, defying
contradiction.

And contradiction generated by this reason is power of motion, motion to escape from

contradiction.

Thus, we may to say that matter is spatial entity of some curvature.

But, where were spatial entities born from? and how can they exist? or are they

products of higher dimensional spaces?, so what is about higher dimensional spaces?

Let us imagine that all vanish, including matter, space, ... and as a whole all possible

diﬀerences.

Then, what is left?

Nothing at all!

But that is a unique remainder!

Clearly, this unique remainder is limitless and homogeneous “everywhere”. Otherwise,

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

9

it will violate our requirement.

then?

We now require the next: even the unique remainder vanishes, too. What will remain,

Not hardly, we indentify immedeately that substitute which replace it is just itself!

Therefore, we call it absolute space.

The absolute space can vanish in itself, in other words, acting negatively it leads to
acting positively itself. That means, the absolute space can self-exist not depending on
any other. It is the former element.

It is the “supreme cause”, too. Because, contrary to anyone’s will, it still contains a

diﬀerence.

Indeed, in the unique there is not anything, but still is the Nothing! Nothing is

contained in Having, Nothing creates Having. Having, but Nothing at all!

Here, negative action is also positive action, Nothing is also Having, and vice versa.

Immanent contradiction of this state is inﬁnitely great.

Express mathematically, the absolute space has zero curvature. In this space there
exist points of inﬁnite curvatures. This diﬀerence is inﬁnitely great and, therefore, con-
tradiction generated is inﬁnitely great, too.

The Nature did not want to exist in such a contradiction state. It had self-looked for

a way to solve, and the consequence was that the Nature was born.

Thus, anew the familiar vague truth is that: “matter is not born naturally (from
nihility), not vanished naturally (in nihility), it always is in motion and transformation
from one form to other. Nowadays, it is necessary to be aﬃrmed again that: “matter is
just created from nothing, but this is not motiveless. The force that makes it generate is
also the power makes it exist, move, and transform.

2 Representation of contradiction under quantitative

formula: Equation of causality

Any contradiction is originated by coexistence of two mutually rejectable actions.

That is represented as follows:

M =

A 6= A
A = A

(cid:26)

− Action K1
− Action K2

.

Clearly, the more severe contradiction M will be if the higher power of mutual rejection
between two actions K1and K2 is. And power of mutual rejection of two actions is
estimated only from the degree of diﬀerence of those two actions.

A contradiction which is solved means that diﬀerence of two actions diminishes to

zero. Herein, two actions K1and K2 all vary to reach and to end at a new action K3.

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

10

Thus, what are the diﬀerences [K1 − K3] and [K2 − K3] dependent on? Obviously,
these diﬀerences are dependent on conservation capacities of actions K1 and K2. The
higher conservation capacity of any action is, the lower diﬀerence between it and the last
action is.

And then, in turn what is conservation capacity of any action dependent on?

There are two elements:

It is dependent on immanent contradiction of action, the greater its immanent con-

tradiction is the lower its conservation capacity is.

It is dependent on new contradiction generated by variation of action. The greater
this contradiction is the more variation of action is resisted and, therefore, the higher its
contradiction capacity is.

Variation, and one kind of which - motion, is generated by contradiction. More exactly,
motion is a manifestation of solution to contradiction. The more severe contradiction
becomes the more urgent need of solution to contradiction will be, and hence the more
violent motion, variation of state, i.e. of contradiction will become. Call the violence,
or the quickness of variation of contradiction Q, the contradiction state is M, the above
principle can be represented as follows:

Q = K(M )M.

We call it equation of causality, where K(M ) is means of solution to contradiction. On
simplest level, K(M ) can be a function of contradiction state. Actually, it represents
easiness of escape from contradiction of state.

If contradiction is characterized by quantities x, y, z, ..., these quantities themselves
will be facilities of transport of contradiction, degrees of freedom over which contradiction
is solved. Hence, easiness is valued as the derivative of contradiction with respect to its
degree of freedom.

The greater derivative value of contradiction with respect to any degree of freedom
is, the higher way-out “scenting” capability in this direction of state becomes, the more
“amount of contradiction” escaped with respect to this degree of freedom is.

Thus,

And we have

K(M ) ∼ |M ′(x, y, z, ...)| .

Q = a |M ′(x, y, z, ...)| M(x, y, z, ...),

where the coeﬃcient a is generated only by choosing system of units of quantities.

We said that diﬀerence is the origin of all, but diﬀerence itself has no meaning. The
so-called meaning is generated in direct relationship, in direct comparison. The Nature
cannot feel diﬀerence through “distance”.

A some state which has any immanent contradiction must vary to reach a new one

having no intrinsic contradiction, or exactly, having inﬁnitesimal contradiction.

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

11

That process is one-way, going continuously through all values of contradiction, from

the beginning value to closing one.

We thus have endeavored to convince that motion (variation) is imperative to have
its cause and property of motion obeys the equation of causality. Then, must invariation,
i.e. conservation be evident without any cause? It is possible to say that: any state has
only two probabilities – either conservable or variable, and more exactly, all are conserved
but if that conservation causes a contradiction, then it must let variation have place to
escape contradiction and this variation obeys the equation of causality.

If this theoretical point is true, our work is only that: learning manner of comprehen-
sion, estimating exactly and completely contradiction of state, and describing it in the
equation of causality, at that time we will have any law of variation.

But is such enough for our terminal perception about the Nature, about people them-
selves with own thought power, to explain wonders, which always surprise generations:
why can the Nature self-perceive itself, through its product - people?!

3 Using the causal principle in some concrete and

simplest phenomena

Advance a quantity T , inverse of Q, to be stagnancy of solution to contradiction. Thus,

T =

1
aM ′M

The sum of stagnancy in the process of solution to contradiction from M0 to M0 −∆M

called the time is generated by this variation (∆t).

Figure 1: Variation of contradiction

From the above deﬁnition and Figure 1, we identify that

∆t ≈ −

T + (T + ∆T )

∆M.

Thus,

We have

= −a |M ′| M.

Therefrom, we obtain a new form of the equation of causality,

dM
dt

= −a |M ′(x, y, z, ...)| M(x, y, z, ...).

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

12

Thus, if we consent to the time as an independent quantity and contradiction as
a time-dependent one, speed of escape from contradiction with respect to the time is
proportional to magnitude of contradiction and means of solution.

In the case that contradiction is characterized by itself, namely M = M(M ), we have

M = M0e−a(t−t0),

where M0 is the contradiction at the time t = t0.

3.1 Thermotransfer principle

Supposing that inn a some distance of an one-dimensional space we have a distribution
of a some quantity L.

If the distribution has immanent diﬀerence, i.e. immanent contradiction, it will self-
vary to reach a new state with lowest immanent contradiction. That variation obeys the
equation of causality,

dM
dt

= −a |M ′| M.

For convenience, we spread this distribution out on the x axis and take a some point

to be an origin of coordinates.

Because the distribution is one of a some quantity L, all its values at points in the space
of distribution must have equidimension (homogeneity). And the immanent diﬀerence of
distribution is just the diﬀerence of degree.

At two points x1 and x2, the quantity L obtains two values L1 and L2, respectively.
Due to the diﬀerence of degree, there is only a way of estimation: taking the diﬀerence
(L2 − L1).

But two points x1 and x2 only ‘feel’ the diﬀerence from each other in direct connection,
contradiction may appear or may not only in that direct connection: at a boundary of two
neighbouring points x1 and x2, L quantity obtains simultaneously two values L1 and L2;
two these actions act negatively on each other and magnitude of contradiction depends
on the diﬀerence (L1 − L2). Therefore, in order for the diﬀerence (L1 − L2) to be the
yield of direct connection between two points x1 and x2, we must let, for example, x2 tend
inﬁnitely to x1 (but not coincide with it).

Whereat, the immanent contradiction at inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of x1 will be

valued as the limit of the ratio:

L1 − L2
x1 − x2
as x2 → x1, i.e. the derivative value of L over the space of distribution at x1. From the
presented problems, we have

The immanent contradiction at each point is solved as Eq.

distribution vary.

We will seek for the law of this variation.

The immanent contradiction at neighbourhood of x is

Thus, it seems that this variation has compressed a some amount of values of L from
higher valued points to lower ones, making ‘a ﬂowing current’ of values of L through x
(Figure 2).

Clearly, the magnitude of ‘the ﬂowing current’, i.e. the amount of values of L ﬂows

through x in the time interval ∆t, is

Similarly, at the point x + ∆x we have

In this example, the current ℑx makes values of L at points in the interval ∆x increase,
and ℑx+∆x makes them decrease. The consequence is that the increment ∆L the interval

Thus

(2)

The time-variational speed of L at neighbourhood of any point of the distribution is
proportional to the second derivative over the space of distribution of this quantity right
at that point.

And as was known, Eq. (2) is just diﬀusion equation (heat-transfer equation) that

had been sought on experimental basis.

On the other hand, the corollary of the above reasoning manner has announced to us
the conservation of values of the quantity L in the whole distribution, although values of
this quantity at each separate point may vary, whenever value at any point decreases a
some amount, then value at its some neighbouring point increases right the same amount.
If the space of distribution is limitless, then along with increase of time the mean value
of distribution will decrease gradually to zero.

3.2 Gyroscope

The conservation of angular momentum vectors may be regarded as the conservation of
two components: direction and magnitude. If in a system the directive conservation is
not violated but the magnitude conservation of vectors is violated, this system must vary
by some way so that the whole system will have a sole angular momentum vector. And
in the case where the conservation not only of magnitude but also of direction are both
violated, solution to contradiction of state depends on the form of articulation.

We now consider the case, in which the gravitational and centrifugal components may

be negligible (Figure 3).

For simplicity, we admit that there is a motor to maintain a constant angular velocity ω
of system. Thus, we are only interested in the contradiction generated by violation of the
directive conservation kω0. The action K1 – the conservation of k−→ω 0, say that: variational
speed of the vector direction k−→ω 0 equals zero. But the action K2 – the conservation of
−→ω , say that: the direction k−→ω 0 must be varied with the angular velocity ω cos α.

Thus, in macroscope, the diﬀerence [K1 − K2] = ω cos α is the origin of that contra-

diction, and the contradiction is proportional to this diﬀerence.

M ∼ ω cos α,
M = |k−→ω 0 × −→ω | = kω0ω cos α.

The taken proportionality factor kω0 (still in macroanalysis) is based on an argument:
if ω0 equals zero, the vector direction k−→ω 0 will not exist certainly, and therefore the
problem of contradiction generated by its directive conservation will not be invented.

Taking the value of M into the equation of causality, we obtain

∂M
∂t
Here, we have calcuted M ′ = M ′
escaping speed of contradiction state will equal zero.

The derivative of contradiction with respect to the time is

α. From the equation we identify that if α = 0, then the

= akω0ω cos α, α 6= 0.

(3)

The variation of α causes a new contradiction, this contradiction is proportional to
value of ∂α/∂t, therefore there is not motional conservation over the component α. And
thus the escaping speed in Eq. (3) is also just the instantaneous velocity of the axis of
rotation plane surface over α.

The time, so that the angle between the axis of rotation plane surface (i.e. the direction

of the vector k−→ω 0) and the horizonal direction varies from the value +0 to α, will be

3.3 Buﬀer zone of ﬁnite space

Supposing that there is a ﬁnite space [A] with intrinsic structure satisfying the invariance
for the principle of causality.

This space is in the absolute space [O]. At the boundary of these two space there

exists a contradiction caused by diﬀerence between them.

The Equation of Causality – D. M. Chi

16

Because both of the spaces conserve themselves, contradiction is only possible to be
solved by forming a buﬀer zone (i.e. ﬁeld), owing to which diﬀerence becomes lesser and
more harmonic. The structure of the buﬀer zone must have a some form so that the level
of harmonicity reaches to a greatest value, i.e. immanent contradiction at each point in
the ﬁeld has lowest possible value.

It is clear that the farther from the center of the space [A] it is the more the property
of [A] diminishes.
In other words, the [A]-surrounding buﬀer zone (ﬁeld) has also the
property of [A] and this property is a function of r – i.e. the distance from the center of
the space [A] to considered point in the ﬁeld (Figure 4).

Figure 4: The structure of the buﬀer ﬁeld of a ﬁnite space

From the problems presented and if the notation of the buﬀer zone is T , we will have

T[A] = g(r)

[A]
r

,

where g(r) is an unknown function of r alone, characterized for the intrinsic harmonicity
of the ﬁeld.

If in the ﬁeld zone T[A] there is a space [B] and this space does not disturb considerably
the ﬁeld T[A], whereat the diﬀerence between [B] and T[A] forces [B] to move in the ﬁeld
T[A] to approach to position where the diﬀerence between [B] and T[A] has lowest value
(here, we have admitted that the space [B] has also self-conservation capability). This
contradiction of state is proportional to the diﬀerence ([B] − T[A]).

If we detect a factor c to use for ‘translating language’ from the property of [B] into

the property of [A], then the contradiction may be expressed as follows

M = f.

c[B] − g(r)

(cid:18)

[A]
r (cid:19)

where f is proportionality factor. And the law of motion of the space [B] in the ﬁeld T[A]
is sought by the equation of causality,

Here, the transfer quantity (degree of freedom) of contradiction is r.

Because the motion of the space [B] must happen simultaneously over all directions
which have centripetal components, therefore the resultant escaping velocity of the state

– i.e. the resultant velocity of the space [B] in the ﬁeld T[A] must be estimated as the
integral of the escaping speed over all directions which have centripetal components.

If proving that the variation of r as well as the conservation of ∂r/∂t causes a new
contradiction proportional to right ∂r/∂t, then the escaping speed obtained is just the
instantaneous velocity of [B] in the ﬁeld T[A].

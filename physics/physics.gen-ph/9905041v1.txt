Quiet Violin, Comment on ”The dead
zone for string players”

I read with interest your recent article about how a vi-
olin generates sound, which reported that Johan Broom-
ﬁeld and Michael Leask had found it becomes impossible
to produce a sound from a string that is bowed at its
midpoint (January p5). However, this ﬁnding is trivial if
one knows the mechanism of bowing

When a horse-tail bow is drawn across a string, tiny
microscopic ”nails” on the surface of the bow constantly
pluck the string as the bow moves over the string (see, for
example, E G Gray, Splitting Hairs, Strad vol.82 p107-
108 (1989)). This is diﬀerent from what happens when
you pluck a string with your ﬁnger. The string can then
vibrate freely once your ﬁnger has left the string. But
with a bow, the nails continuously intervene in the vibra-
tion, producing a sort of ”forced” or ”kicked” vibration.
Once one nail has passed over the string, the string can
only vibrate freely for a short period before the next nail
arrives. Indeed, the nails are so closely spaced that it is

perhaps better to describe them as ”brushes” or ”combs.
It is therefore better for the amplitude of vibration at
the bowing point to be about the same as the spacing
of the nails so that the intervention of the nails is mini-
mized. If the amplitude is larger than the spacing of the
nails, the string does not manage to vibrate much before
the next nail arrives. (Actually, the presence of the next
nail does not stop the vibration completely; it only ”con-
strains” the vibration to the position of the next nail.)
This mechanism applies to every part of the string, but
the inﬂuence of the next nail becomes most signiﬁcant as
you bow at the midpoint –***because the amplitude of
vibration is then at its largest***.

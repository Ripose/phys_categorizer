Can physics laws be derived from
monogenic functions?

José B. Almeida
Universidade do Minho, Physics Department
Braga, Portugal, email: josebda@gmail.com

This is a paper about geometry and how one can derive several
fundamental laws of physics from a simple postulate of geometrical
nature. The method uses monogenic functions analysed in the alge-
bra of 5-dimensional spacetime, exploring the 4-dimensional waves
that they generate. With this method one is able to arrive at equations
of relativistic dynamics, quantum mechanics and electromagnetism.
Fields as disparate as cosmology and particle physics will be inﬂu-
enced by this approach in a way that the paper only suggests. The pa-
per provides an introduction to a formalism which shows prospects
of one day leading to a theory of everything and suggests several
areas of future development.

1 Introduction

The editor’s invitation to write a chapter for this book about ether and the Uni-
verse led me to think how my recent work had anything to do with ether, because
the word was never used previously in my writings. It will become clear in the
following sections that the concept of a privileged frame or absolute motion un-
derlies all the argument. When one accepts the existence of a preferred frame,

1

the question of attaching that frame to some observable feature of the Universe is
immediate. This question is addressed in Sec. 8 but we can anticipate that galaxy
clusters are ﬁxed and can be seen as the anchors for the preferred frame. This
statement seems inconsistent with the observation that clusters of galaxies move
relative to each other but it is resolved invoking an hyperspherical symmetry in
the Universe that is revealed by the choice of appropriate coordinates.

The relationship between geometry and physics is probably stronger in the
General Theory of Relativity (GTR) than in any other physics ﬁeld. It is the
author’s belief that a perfect theory will eventually be formulated, where geom-
etry and physics become indistinguishable, so that the complete understanding
of space properties, together with proper assignments between geometric and
physical entities, will provide all necessary predictions, not only in relativistic
dynamics but in physics as a whole.

We don’t have such perfect theory yet, however the author intends to show that
GTR and Quantum Mechanics (QM) can be seen as originating from monogenic
functions in the algebra of the 5-dimensional spacetime G4,1. These functions
can generate a null displacement condition, thus reducing the dimensionality by
one to the number of dimensions we are all used to. Besides generating GTR
and QM, the same space generates also 4-dimensional Euclidean space where
dynamics can be formulated and is quite often equivalent to the relativistic coun-
terpart; Euclidean relativistic dynamics resembles Fermat’s principle extended
to 4 dimensions and is thus designated as 4-Dimensional Optics (4DO).

Our goal is to show how the important equations of physics, such as relativity
equations and equations of quantum mechanics, can be put under the umbrella
of a common mathematical approach[1, 2]. We use geometric algebra as the
framework but introduce monogenic functions with their null derivatives in order
to advance the concept. Furthermore, we clarify some previous work in this
direction and identify the steps to take in order to complete this ambitious project.
Since A. Einstein formulated dynamics in 4-dimensional spacetime, this space
is recognized by the vast majority of physicists as being the best for formulating
the laws of physics. However, mathematical considerations lead to several alter-
native 4D spaces. For example, the Euclidean 4-dimensional space of 4DO is
equivalent to the 4D spacetime of GTR when the metric is static, and therefore
the geodesics of one space can be mapped one-to-one with those of the other.
Then one can choose to work in the space that is more suitable. We build upon
previous work by ourselves and by other authors about null geodesics, regarding
the condition that all material particles must follow null geodesics of 5D space:

The implication of this for particles is clear: they should travel on
null 5D geodesics. This idea has recently been taken up in the liter-
ature, and has a considerable future. It means that what we perceive
as massive particles in 4D are akin to photons in 5D.[3]

2

Accordingly, particles moving on null paths in 5D (dS2 = 0) will
appear as massive particles moving on timelike paths in 4D (ds2 > 0)
. . . [4]

We actually improve on these null displacement ideas by introducing the more
fundamental monogenic condition, deriving the former from the latter and estab-
lishing a common ﬁrst principle.

−

The only postulates in this paper are of a geometrical nature and can be sum-
marized in the deﬁnition of the space we are going to work with; this is the 4-
dimensional null subspace of the 5-dimensional space with signature (
+ + +
+). The choice of this geometric space does not imply any assumption for physi-
cal space up to the point where geometric entities like coordinates and geodesics
start being assigned to physical quantities like distances and trajectories. Some
of those assignments will be made very soon in the exposition and will be kept
consistently until the end in order to allow the reader some assessment of the
proposed geometric model as a tool for the prediction of physical phenomena.
Mapping between geometry and physics is facilitated if one chooses to work
always with non-dimensional quantities; this is done with a suitable choice for
standards of the fundamental units. From this point onwards all problems of
dimensional homogeneity are avoided through the use of normalizing factors
listed below for all units, deﬁned with recourse to the fundamental constants:

This normalization deﬁnes a system of non-dimensional units (Planck units)
with important consequences, namely: 1) All the fundamental constants, ¯h, G,
c, e, become unity; 2) a particle’s Compton frequency, deﬁned by n = mc2/¯h,
becomes equal to the particle’s mass; 3) the frequent term GM/(c2r) is simpliﬁed
to M/r.

5-dimensional space can have amazing structure, providing countless parallels
to the physical world; this paper is just a limited introductory look at such struc-
ture and parallels. The exposition makes full use of an extraordinary and little
known mathematical tool called geometric algebra (GA), a.k.a. Clifford algebra,
which received an important thrust with the works of David Hestenes [5]. A
good introduction to GA can be found in Gull et al. [6] and the following para-
graphs use basically the notation and conventions therein. A complete course on
physical applications of GA can be downloaded from the internet [7]; the same
authors published a more comprehensive version in book form [8]. An accessible

3

presentation of mechanics in GA formalism is provided by Hestenes [9]. This is
the subject of ﬁrst section, where some essential GA concepts and notation are
introduced.

Section two deals with monogenic function in ﬂat 5D spacetime, deriving spe-
cial relativity and the free particle Dirac equation from this simple concept. 4DO
appears here as a perfect equivalent to special relativity, where trajectories can
be understood as normals to 4-dimensional plane-like waves. The following sec-
tion improves on this by allowing for curved space, introducing the notion of
refractive index tensor. Section ﬁve examines the variational principle applied
in both 4DO and GTR spaces to justify the equivalence of geodesics between
the two spaces for static metrics. Refractive index is then related to its sources
and the sources tensor is deﬁned. The case of a central mass is examined and the
links to Schwarzschild’s metric are thoroughly discussed. Electromagnetism and
electrodynamics are formulated as particular cases of refractive index in section
seven and the sources tensor is here related to a current vector. The next sec-
tion introduces the hypothesis of an hyperspherical symmetry in the Universe,
which would call for the use of hyperspherical coordinates; the consequences
for cosmology would include a complete dismissal of dark matter for a ﬂat rate
Hubble expansion. Before the conclusion, section nine shows how the mono-
genic condition is effective in generating an SU (4) symmetry group and makes
some advances towards a relation with the standard model of particle physics.

2 Introduction to geometric algebra

Geometric algebra is not usually taught in university courses and its presence in
the literature is scarce; good reference works are [5, 7, 8]. We will concentrate
on the algebra of 5-dimensional spacetime because this will be our main working
space; this algebra incorporates as subalgebras those of the usual 3-dimensional
Euclidean space, Euclidean 4-space and Minkowski spacetime. We begin with
the simpler 5D ﬂat space and progress to a 5D spacetime of general curvature.

The geometric algebra G4,1 of the hyperbolic 5-dimensional space we consider
a such that

is generated by the coordinate frame of orthonormal basis vectors s

Note that the English characters i, j, k range from 1 to 4 while the Greek char-
acters a , b , g range from 0 to 4. See the Appendix A for the complete notation
convention used.

Any two basis vectors can be multiplied, producing the new entity called a
bivector. This bivector is the geometric product or, quite simply, the product;

4

6
this product is distributive. Similarly to the product of two basis vectors, the
product of three different basis vectors produces a trivector and so forth up to the
ﬁvevector, because ﬁve is the dimension of space.

We will simplify the notation for basis vector products using multiple indices,

. The algebra is 32-dimensional and is spanned by the basis

It is easy to verify the equations above; suppose we want to check that (s 0i j)2 =
1. Start by expanding the square and remove the compact notation (s 0i j)2 =
s 0s
j twice to bring it next to its homonymous;
each swap changes the sign, so an even number of swaps preserves the sign:
(s 0i j)2 = s 0s
i. From the third equation (2.1) we know that the squared
vector is unity and we get successively (s 0i j)2 = s 0s
i)2 =

(s 0)2(s
(s 0)2; using the ﬁrst equation (2.1) we get ﬁnally (s 0i j)2 = 1 as desired.
The remaining basis elements square to

Note that the pseudoscalar i commutes with all the other basis elements while
being a square root of
1; this makes it a very special element which can play
the role of the scalar imaginary in complex algebra.

The inner product is the same as the usual ”dot product,” the only difference
being in the negative sign of the a0b0 term; this is to be expected and is similar
to what one ﬁnds in special relativity. The outer product represents an oriented
area; in Euclidean 3-space it can be linked to the "cross product" by the relation
b; here we introduced bold characters for 3-dimensional
cross(a, b) =
vectors and avoided deﬁning a symbol for the cross product because we will not
use it again. We also used the convention that interior and exterior products take
precedence over geometric product in an expression.

When a vector is operated with a multivector the inner product reduces the
grade of each element by one unit and the outer product increases the grade
by one. We will generalize the deﬁnition of inner and outer products below;
under this generalized deﬁnition the inner product between a vector and a scalar
produces a vector. Given a multivector a we refer to its grade-r part by writing
< a >r; the scalar or grade zero part is simply designated as < a >. By operating
a vector with itself we obtain a scalar equal to the square of the vector’s length

In mixed product expressions we will always use the convention that inner and

an axis (vector) because the latter only works in 3D while the former is applicable
in any dimension. When the plane of bivector B contains s 0, a similar operation
does not produce a simple rotation but produces a boost, eventually combined
with a rotation. Take for instance B = s 01q /2 and deﬁne the transformation

In 5-dimensional spacetime of general curvature, we introduce 5 coordinate

those satisfying condition (2.22).

The ﬁrst use we will make of the reciprocal frame is for the deﬁnition of two

derivative operators. In ﬂat space we deﬁne the vector derivative

¶ a .

(2.23)

It will be convenient, sometimes, to use vector derivatives in subspaces of 5D
space; these will be denoted by an upper index before the (cid:209)
and the particular
index used determines the subspace to which the derivative applies; For instance
m(cid:209) = s m¶ m = s 1¶ 1 + s 2¶ 2 + s 3¶ 3. In 5-dimensional space it will be useful to
split the vector derivative into its time and 4-dimensional parts

(cid:209) =

The second derivative operator is the covariant derivative, sometimes called

the Dirac operator, and it is deﬁned in the reciprocal frame ga

D = g

¶ a .

Taking into account the deﬁnition of the reciprocal frame (2.18), we see that
the covariant derivative is also a vector. In cases such as those we consider in
this work, where there is a refractive index, it will be possible to deﬁne both
derivatives in the same space.

We deﬁne also second order differential operators, designated Laplacian and
covariant Laplacian respectively, resulting from the inner product of one deriva-
tive operator by itself. The square of a vector is always a scalar and the vector
derivative is no exception, so the Laplacian is a scalar operator, which conse-
quently acts separately in each component of a multivector. For 4 + 1 ﬂat space
it is

One sees immediately that a 4-dimensional wave equation is obtained by zeroing
the Laplacian of some function

3 Monogenic functions and waves in ﬂat space

It turns out that there is a class of functions of great importance, called mono-
genic functions,[8] characterized by having null vector derivative; a function y
is monogenic if and only if

A monogenic function has by necessity null Laplacian, as can be seen by dotting
Eq. (3.1) with (cid:209) on the left. We are then allowed to write

y = 0.

¶ iiy = ¶ 00y

.

This can be recognized as a wave equation in the 4-dimensional space spanned
by s

i which will accept plane wave type solutions of the general form
y = y 0ei(pa xa
where y 0 is an amplitude whose characteristics we shall not discuss for now, d
is a phase angle and pa are constants such that

By setting the argument of y constant in Eq. (3.3) and differentiating we can

get the differential equation

a
pa dx

= 0.

·

dx = 0, where p = s

The ﬁrst member can equivalently be written as the inner product of the two
a pa . In 5D hyperbolic space the inner product
vectors p
of two vectors can be null when the vectors are perpendicular but also when
the two vectors are null; since we have established that p is a null vector, Eq.
(3.5) can be satisﬁed either by dx normal to p or by (dx)2 = 0. In the former
case the condition describes a 3-volume called wavefront and in the latter case
it describes the wave motion. Notice that the wavefronts are not surfaces but
volumes, because we are working with 4-dimensional waves.
The condition describing wave motion can be expanded as

(dx0)2 +(cid:229)

(dxi)2 = 0.

−

(3.6)

This is a purely scalar equation and can be manipulated as such, which means
we are allowed to rewrite it with any chosen terms in the second member; some
of those manipulations are particularly signiﬁcant. Suppose we decide to isolate
(dx4)2 in the ﬁrst member: (dx4)2 = (dx0)2
(cid:229) (dxm)2. We can then rename
coordinate x4 as t , to get the interval squared of special relativity for space-like
displacements

(dxm)2.

(cid:209)
(cid:229)
(cid:229)
(cid:229)
We have thus derived the space-like part of special relativity as a consequence
of monogeneity in 5D hyperbolic space and simultaneously justiﬁed the physical
interpretation for coordinates x0 and x4 as time and proper time, respectively.

A different manipulation of Eq. (3.6) has great signiﬁcance because it leads to
the 4DO concept.[11, 12] If we isolate (dx0)2 and replace x0 by the letter t, we
see that time becomes the interval in Euclidean 4D space

dt2 = (cid:229)

(dxi)2.

(3.8)

From this we conclude that the monogenic condition produces plane waves whose
wavefronts are 3D volumes but can be represented by wavefront normals, just as
it happens in standard optics with electromagnetic waves.

Several readers may be worried with the fact that proper time is a line integral
and not a coordinate in special relativity and so dt should not be allowed to ap-
pear on the rhs of the equation. To this we will argue that the manipulations we
have done, collapsing 5D spacetime into 4 dimensions through a null displace-
ment condition and then promoting one of the coordinates into interval, is exactly
equivalent to the process of deﬁning a light cone in Minkowski spacetime and
then applying Fermat’s principle to deﬁne an Euclidean 3D metric on the light
cone; we have just upgraded the procedure by including one extra dimension.

The Dirac equation can also be derived from the monogenic condition but
since it appears formulated in terms of matrices in all textbooks we will have
to rewrite Eq. (3.1) also in terms of matrices, so that our GA manipulations can
also be understood as matrix operations. This is easily achieved if we assign our
frame vectors to Dirac matrices that square to the the identity matrix or minus
the identity matrix as appropriate; the following list of assignments can be used
but others would be equally effective1

It will then be possible to verify that the inner product of any two different s -

an orthonormal basis expressed in matrix form. A more formal approach to
this subject would lead us to invoke the isomorphism between the complex al-

(3.12)

The only thing this equation needs to be recognized as Dirac’s is the replacement
of p4 by the particle’s mass m; simultaneously we assign the energy E to p0 and
3D momentum p to s m pm.

We turn now our attention to the amplitude y 0 in Eq. (3.3) because we know
that the Dirac equation accepts solutions which are spinors and we want to ﬁnd
out their equivalents in our formulation. Applying the monogenic condition to
Eq. (3.3) we see that the following equation must be veriﬁed

a

y 0(s

pa ) = 0.

(3.13)

If the s s are interpreted as matrices, remembering that p is null, the only way the
equation can be veriﬁed is by y 0 being some constant multiplied by the matrix
in parenthesis, which is a matrix representation of p. We can set the multiplying
constant to unity and y 0 becomes equal to p; the wavefunction y
can then be
interpreted as a Dirac spinor. The wave function in Eq. (3.3) can now be given a
different form, taking in consideration the previous assignments

In order to separate left and right spinor components we use a technique
adapted from Ref. [8]. We choose an arbitrary 4
4 matrix which squares
to identity, for instance s 4, with which we form the two idempotent matrices
(I + s 4)/2 and (I
s 4)/2.1 These matrices are called idempotents because they
reproduce themselves when squared. These idempotents absorb any s 4 factor;
as can be easily checked (I + s 4)s 4 = (I + s 4) and (I

4 Relativistic dynamics

When working in curved spaces the monogenic condition is naturally modiﬁed,
replacing the vector derivative (cid:209) with the covariant derivative D. A generalized
monogenic function is then a function that veriﬁes the equation

Similarly to what happens in ﬂat space, the covariant Laplacian is a scalar and a
monogenic function must verify the second order differential equation

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

(4.1)

(4.2)

It is possible to write a general expression for the covariant Laplacian in terms of
the metric tensor components (see [16, Section 2.11]) but we will consider only
situations where that complete general expression is not needed.

1Matrix s 4 is the same as matrix g 5 = ig 0g 1g 2g 3.

Dy = 0.

D2y = 0.

13

When Eq. (4.1) is multiplied on the left by D, we are applying second deriva-
tives to the function, but we are simultaneously applying ﬁrst order derivatives to
the reciprocal frame vectors present in the deﬁnition of D itself. We can simplify
the calculations if the variations of the frame vectors are taken to be much slower
than those of function y
so that frame vector derivatives can be neglected. With
this approximation, the covariant Laplacian becomes D2 = gab
and Eq. (4.2)
can be written

¶ ab

g

¶ ab

y = 0.

This equation can have a solution of the type given by Eq. (3.3) if again the
derivatives of pa are neglected. This approximation is usually of the same order
as the former one and should not be seen as a second restriction. Inserting Eq.
(3.3) one sees that it is a solution if

(4.3)

(4.4)

ab

g

pa pb = 0.

This equation is the curved space equivalent to Eq. (3.4) and it means that the
square of vector p = ga pa
is zero, that is, p is a vector of zero length; for this
reason it is called a null vector or nilpotent. Vector p is the momentum vector
and should not be confused with 4-dimensional conjugate momentum vectors
deﬁned below.

We arrive again at Eq. (3.5) and the condition describing 4D wave motion can

be expanded as

a
gab dx

b
dx

= 0.

(4.5)

This condition effectively reduces the spatial dimension to four but the resulting
space is non-metric because all displacements have zero length. We will remove
this difﬁculty by considering two special cases. First let us assume that vector g0
is normal to the other frame vectors so that all g0i factors are zeroed; condition
(4.5) becomes

g00(dx0)2 + gi jdxidx j = 0.
All the terms in this equation are scalars and we are allowed to rewrite it with
(dx0)2 in the lhs

(4.6)

(dx0)2 =

dxidx j.

gi j

−
We could have arrived at the same result by deﬁning a 4-dimensional displace-
ment vector

1
dx0v = −
√g00
and then squaring it to evaluate its length; v is a unit vector called velocity be-
cause its deﬁnition is similar to the usual deﬁnition of 3-dimensional velocity;
its components are

gidxi;

(4.8)

(4.7)

(4.9)

vi =

dxi
dx0 .

14

Being unitary, the velocity can be obtained by a rotation of the s 4 frame vector

v = ˜Rs 4R.

(4.10)

The rotation angle is a measure of the 3-dimensional velocity component. A
null angle corresponds to v directed along s 4 and null 3D component, while a
p /2 angle corresponds to the maximum possible 3D component. The idea that
physical velocity can be seen as the 3D component of a unitary 4D vector has
been explored in several papers but see [17].

Equation (4.8) projects the original 5-dimensional space into an Euclidean
signature 4 dimensional space, where an elementary displacement is given by the
variation of coordinate x0. In the particular case where g0 = s 0 the displacement
vector simpliﬁes to dx0v = gidxi and we can see clearly that the signature is
Euclidean because the four gi have positive norm. Although it has not been
mentioned, we have assumed that none of the frame vectors is a function of
coordinate x0.

Returning to Eq. (4.6) we can now impose the condition that g4 is normal to
the other frame vectors in order to isolate (dx4)2 instead of (dx0)2, as we did
before;

(dx4)2 =

We have now projected onto 4-dimensional space with signature (+

the diagonal elements gii are necessarily positive, which allows a veriﬁcation
of Minkowski signature. Contrary to what happened in the previous case, we
cannot now obtain (dx4)2 by squaring a vector but we can do it by consideration
of the bivector

1
g44g44
All the products gm g4 are bivectors because we imposed g4 to be normal to the
other frame vectors. When (dx4)2 is evaluated by an inner product we notice that
g0g4 has positive square while the three gmg4 have negative square, ensuring that
a Minkowski signature is obtained. Naturally we have to impose the condition
is such that n 2 = nn = 1
that none of the frame vectors depends on x4. Bivector n

where T is of the form T = exp(B) and B is a bivector whose plane is normal to
s 4. Note that T is a pure rotation when the bivector plane is normal to both s 0
and s 4.

In special relativity it is usual to work in a space spanned by an orthonormed
frame of vectors g m such that (g 0)2 = 1 and (g m)2 =
1, producing the desired
Minkowski signature [8]. The geometric algebra of this space is isomorphic to
the even sub-algebra of G4,1 and so the area element dx4n (4.13) can be reformu-
lated as a vector called relativistic 4-velocity. The four g bivectors are deﬁned in
a similar way to the g matrices used in Eq. (3.12), which is to be expected from
the isomorphism between geometric and matrix algebras already mentioned.

Equations (4.7) and (4.11) deﬁne two alternative 4-dimensional spaces, those
gi j/g00 and general theory
of 4-dimensional optics (4DO), with metric tensor
gmn /g44, respectively; in the former x0
of relativity (GTR) with metric tensor
−
is an afﬁne parameter while in the latter it is x4 that takes such role.
In fact
Eq. (4.11) only covers the spacelike part of GTR space, because (dx4)2 is nec-
essarily non-negative. Naturally there is the limitation that the frame vectors
are independent of both x0 and x4, equivalent to imposing a static metric, and
also that g0i = gm 4 = 0. Provided the metric is static, the geodesics of 4DO can
be mapped one-to-one with spacelike geodesics of GTR and we can choose to
work on the space that best suits us for free fall dynamics. For a physical in-
terpretation of geometric relations it will frequently be convenient to assign new
designations to the 5D coordinates that acquire the role of afﬁne parameter in
t ; total derivatives
the null subspace. We recall the assignments x0
with respect to these coordinates will receive a special notation: d f /dt = ˙f and
d f /dt = ˇf .

t and x4

≡

≡

Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we will assume that the frame vector associated
with coordinate x0 is unitary and normal to all the others, that is g0 = s 0 and
g0i = 0. Recalling from Eq. (4.7), these conditions allow the deﬁnition of 4DO
space with metric tensor gi j. Although we could try a more general approach,
we would loose the possibility of interpreting time as a line element and this,
as we shall see, provides very interesting and novel interpretations of physics’
equations. In many cases it is also true that g4 is normal to the other frame vectors
and we have seen that in those cases we can make metric conversions between
GTR and 4DO; as we shall see, electromagnetism requires a non-normal g4 and
so we leave this possibility open.

For the moment we will concentrate on isotropic space, characterized by or-
thogonal refractive index vectors gi whose norm can change with coordinates
but is the same for all vectors. Normally we relax this condition by accepting
that the three gm must have equal norm but g4 can be different. The reason for
this relaxed isotropy is found in the parallel we make with physics by assigning
dimensions 1 to 3 to physical space. Isotropy in a physical sense need only be
concerned with these dimensions and ignores what happens with dimension 4.

16

We will therefore characterize an isotropic space by the refractive index frame
g0 = s 0, gm = nrs m, g4 = n4s 4. Indeed we could also accept a non-orthogonal
g4 within the relaxed isotropy concept but we will not do so for the moment.

Equation (4.7) can now be written in terms of the isotropic refractive indices

as

dt2 = (nr)2 (cid:229)

(dxm)2 + (n4dt )2.

m

(4.15)

Spherically symmetric static metrics play a special role; this means that the re-
fractive index can be expressed as functions of r if we adopt spherical coordi-
nates. The previous equation then becomes

dt2 = (nr)2

dr2 + r2(dq 2 + sin2 q dj 2)

+ (n4dt )2.

Since we have g4 normal to the other vectors we can apply metric conversion
and write the equivalent quadratic form for GTR

These refractive indices provide a 4DO Euclidean space equivalent to Schwarzschild
metric, allowing 4DO to be used as an alternative to GTR. Recalling that we de-
rived trajectories from solutions (3.3) of a 4-dimensional wave equation (4.3),
it becomes clear that orbits can also be seen as 4-dimensional guided waves by
what could be described as a 4-dimensional optical ﬁbre. Modes are to be ex-
pected in these waveguides and we shall say something about them later on.

5 Fermat’s principle in 4 dimensions

Fermat’s principle applies to optics and states that the path followed by a light
ray is the one that makes the travel time an extremum; usually it is the path that
minimizes the time but in some cases a ray can follow a path of maximum or
stationary time. These solutions are usually unstable, so one takes the view that
light must follow the quickest path. In Eq. (4.7) we have deﬁned a time interval
associated with a 4-dimensional elementary displacement, which allows us to
determine, by integration, a travel time associated with displacements of any
size along a given 4-dimensional path. We can then extend Fermat’s principle
to 4D and impose an extremum requirement in order to select a privileged path
between any two 4D points. Taking the square root to Eq. (4.7)

In order to evaluate the previous integral one must know the particular path link-
ing the points by deﬁning functions xi(t), allowing the replacement dxi = ˙xidt.
At this stage it is useful to deﬁne a Lagrangian

The time integral can then be written

Time has to remain stationary against any small change of path; therefore

i(t) are functions that specify distortion. Since the

6 The sources of refractive index

The set of 4 equations (5.16) deﬁnes the geodesics of 4DO space; particularly in
cases where there is a refractive index, it deﬁnes trajectories of minimum time
but does not tell us anything about what produces the refractive index in the
ﬁrst place. Similarly the set of equations (5.19) deﬁnes the geodesics of GTR
space without telling us what shapes space. In order to analyse this question we
must return to the general case of a refractive frame ga without other impositions
besides the existence of a refractive index.

By a suitable choice of coordinates we can always have g0 = s 0. We can then
invoke the fact that for an elementary particle in ﬂat space the momentum vector
components can be associated with the concepts of energy, 3D momentum and
rest mass as p = Es 0 + p + ms 4 (see Sec. 3.) If this consequence is extended to
curved space and to mass distributions, we write p = Es 0 + p + mg4, where now
E is energy density, p = pmgm is 3D momentum density and m is mass density.
The previous equation then becomes

˙Es 0 + ˙p + m ˙g4 = ˙x

G.

When the Laplacian is applied to the momentum vector the result is still nec-

b contains the coefﬁcients of the sources vector

geodesics as we shall see in one particularly important situation. One important
consequence that we don’t pursue here is that by zeroing the sources vector one
obtains the wave equation D2 p = 0, which accepts gravitational wave solutions.
If s 0 is normal to the other frame vectors we can write p = E(s 0 + v) in the

Since G can have scalar and bivector components, the scalar part must be re-

tions deﬁned by Eq. (4.16); this means that the refractive index can be expressed

The search for solutions of Eq. (6.4) must necessarily start with vanishing
second member, a zero sources situation, which one would implicitly assign to
vacuum; this is a wrong assumption as we will show. Zeroing the second member
implies that the Laplacian of both nr and n4 must be zero; considering that they

which produces the solution n4 = nr. So space must be truly isotropic and not
relaxed isotropic as we had allowed. The solution we have found for the refrac-
tive index components in isotropic space can correctly model Newton dynamics,
which led the author to adhere to it for some time [17]. However if inserted into
Eq. (4.11) this solution produces a GTR metric which is veriﬁably in disagree-
ment with observations; consequently it has purely geometric signiﬁcance.

The inadequacy of the isotropic solution found above for relativistic predic-
tions deserves some thought, so that we can search for solutions guided by the
results that are expected to have physical signiﬁcance. In the physical world we
are never in a situation of zero sources because the shape of space or the ex-
istence of a refractive index must always be tested with a test particle. A test
particle is an abstraction corresponding to a point mass considered so small as
to have no inﬂuence on the shape of space; in reality a point particle is a black
hole in GTR, although this fact is always overlooked; one wonders how a black
hole is postulated not to inﬂuence space geometry. A test particle must be seen
as source of refractive index itself and its inﬂuence on the shape of space should
not be neglected in any circumstances. If this is the case the solutions for van-
ishing sources vector may have only geometric meaning, with no connection to
physical reality.

The question is then what should go into the second member of Eq. (6.4)
in order to ﬁnd physically meaningful solutions. If we are testing gravity we
must assume some mass density to suffer gravitational inﬂuence; this is what is
usually designated as non-interacting dust, meaning that some continuous distri-
bution of non-interacting particles follows the geodesics of space. Mass density
is expected to be associated with S4
4; on the other hand we are assuming that
this mass density is very small and so we use ﬂat space Laplacian to evaluate it.
We consequently make an ad hoc proposal for the sources vector in the second
member of Eq. (6.4)

Equation (6.4) becomes

S =

(cid:209) 2n4s 4.

When nr is given the exponential form found above, the solution is n4 = √nr.
This can now be entered into Eq. (4.11) and the coefﬁcients can be expanded
in series and compared to Schwarzschild’s for the determination of parameter a.
The ﬁnal solution, for a stationary mass M is

nr = e2M/r,

n4 = eM/r.

Expanding in series of M/r the coefﬁcients of this metric one would ﬁnd that
the lower order terms are exactly the same as for Schwarzschild’s and so the
predictions of the metrics are indistinguishable for small values of the expansion
variable. Montanus [19] arrives at the same solutions with a different reasoning;
Yilmaz was probably the ﬁrst author to propose this metric [20, 21, 22].

Equation (6.14) can be interpreted in physical terms as containing the essence
of gravitation. When solved for spherically symmetric solutions, as we have
done, the ﬁrst member provides the deﬁnition of a stationary gravitational mass
as the factor M appearing in the exponent and the second member deﬁnes iner-
tial mass as (cid:209) 2n4. Gravitational mass is deﬁned with recourse to some particle
which undergoes gravitational inﬂuence and is animated with velocity v and in-
ertial mass cannot be deﬁned without some ﬁeld n4 acting upon it. Complete
investigation of the sources tensor elements and their relation to physical quan-
tities is not yet done; it is believed that 16 terms of this tensor have strong links
with homologous elements of stress tensor in GTR, while the others are related
to electromagnetic ﬁeld.

7 Electromagnetism in 5D spacetime

Maxwell’s equations can easily be written in the form of Eq. (6.4) if we don’t
impose the condition that g4 should remain normal the other frame vectors; as
we have seen in section 3 this has the consequence that there will be no GTR
equivalent to the equations formulated in 4DO.

We will consider the non-orthonormed reciprocal frame deﬁned by

Please refer to [8, Chap. 7] or to [7, Part 2] to see how these equations generate
classical electromagnetism.

In free space we make J = 0 and Eq. (7.9) accepts plane wave solutions for
F which are of course electromagnetic waves. Notice that these solutions prop-
agate in directions normal to proper time, which is perfectly consistent with the
classical relativistic formulation.

The Dirac equation for a free particle has been derived from the 5-dimensional
monogenic condition in Sec. 3 but we are now in position to include the effects
of an EM ﬁeld. Because we are working in geometric algebra, our quantum
mechanics equations will inherit that character but the isomorphism between the
geometric algebra of 5D spacetime, G4,1, and complex algebra of 4
4 matrices,
M(4,C), ensures that they can be translated into the more usual Dirac matrix

in Sec. 7 to implement classical electromagnetism. The monogenic condition

This equation can be compared to what is found in any quantum mechanics text-

It is now adequate to say a few words about quantization, which is inherent
to 5D monogenic functions. We have already seen that these functions are 4-
dimensional waves, that is, they have 3-dimensional wavefronts normal to the
direction of propagation. Whenever the refractive index distribution traps one of
these waves a 4-dimensional waveguide is produced, which has its own allowed
propagating modes. In the particular case of a central potential, be it an atom’s
or a galaxy’s nucleus, we expect spherical harmonic modes, which produce the
well known electron orbitals in the atom and have unknown manifestations in a
galaxy.

8 Hyperspherical coordinates

Deriving physical equations and predictions from purely geometrical equations

to physical entities; the same space will produce different predictions if differ-
In the previous sections we

assumed that empty space could be modelled by an assignment of time, three
spatial directions and proper time to ﬁve orthogonal directions in 5D spacetime.
We are now going to experiment with a different assignment of ﬂat space coor-
dinates, which will explore the possibility that physics and the Universe have an
inbuilt hyperspherical symmetry. The exercise consists on assigning coordinate
x4 = t
to the radius of an hypersphere and the three xm coordinates to distances
measured on the hypersphere surface; time, x0, will still be measured along a
direction normal to all others. If the hypersphere radius is very large we will
not be able to notice the curvature on everyday phenomena, in the same way as
everyday displacements on Earth don’t seem curved to us. The Universe as a
whole will manifest the consequences of its hyperspherical symmetry; using the
Earth as a 3-dimensional analogue of an hyperspherical Universe, although our
everyday life is greatly unaffected by Earth’s curvature the atmosphere senses
this curvature and shows manifestations of it in winds and climate. What we

26

propose here is an exercise consisting of an arbitrary assignment between coor-
dinates and physical entities; the validity of such exercise can only be judged by
the predictions it allows and how well they conform with observations.

Hyperspherical coordinates are characterized by one distance coordinate, t
and three angles r , q , j ; following the usual procedure we will associate with
t , s
s
these coordinates the frame vectors
. The position vector for
one point in 5D space is quite simply

In order to write an elementary displacement dx we must consider the rotation
of frame vectors, but we don’t need to think hard about it because we can extend
what is known from ordinary spherical coordinates.

dx = s 0dt + s 4dt + ts

r dr + t sin rs

Geodesics of ﬂat space are naturally straight lines, no matter which coordi-
nate system we use, however it is useful to derive geodesic equations from a
Lagrangian of the form (5.3); in hyperspherical coordinates the Lagrangian be-
comes

˙r 2 + sin2 r

(8.6)

It may seem strange that any physically meaningful relation can be derived
from the simple coordinate assignment that we have made, that is, proper time
is associated with hypersphere radius and the three usual space coordinates are
assigned to distances on the hypersphere radius. This unexpected fact results
from the possibility offered by hyperspherical coordinates to explore a symmetry
in the Universe that becomes hidden when we use Cartesian coordinates. In the
real world we measure distances between objects, namely cosmological objects,
rather than angles; we have therefore to deﬁne a distance coordinate, which is
obviously r = tr
. It does not matter where in the Universe we place the origin
for r and we ﬁnd it convenient to place ourselves on the origin.

27

Radial velocities ˙r measure movement in a radial direction from our observa-
tion point; we are particularly interested in this type of movement in order to ﬁnd
a link to the Hubble relation. Applying the chain rule and then replacing r

We expect objects that have not suffered any interaction to move along s
t ; from
(8.4) we see that this implies ˙r = ˙q = ˙j = 0 and then ˙t becomes unity. Replacing
in the equation above and rearranging

˙r = r ˙t + ˙rt =

˙t
t r + ˙rt

.

˙r
r

=

t .

(8.7)

(8.8)

What this equation tells us is exactly what is expressed by the Hubble relation.
The value of t can be taken as constant for any given observation because the
distance information is carried by photons and these preserve proper time, as
we have seen in our discussion about electromagnetic waves.1 The ﬁrst member
of the equation is the deﬁnition of the Hubble parameter and we can then write
H = 1/t . In this way we ﬁnd the physical meaning of coordinate t as being the
Universe’s age.

Underlying the present discussion there is an assumption a preferred frame
where stillness means moving along s
t ; there is no question of equivalent in-
ertial frames here. This preferred frame is obviously attached to the observable
still objects in the Universe which are galaxy clusters, as much as we can tell.
This is far from the orthodox point of view, because galaxy clusters are seen as
moving relative to each other and so cannot possible deﬁne a ﬁxed frame. But
in our formulation still objects move in straight lines along the proper time di-
rection and keep their angular separations constant; this is naturally perceived
as increasing mutual distances. If there is any relation between our formulation
and an ether it must be found in the fact that movement has an absolute meaning,
so it is deﬁned relative to something that is ﬁxed; we call the ﬁxed reference a
preferred frame while other authors call it ether.

How does the use of hyperspherical coordinates affect dynamics in our labo-
ratory experiments? We would like to know if these coordinates need only be
considered in problems of cosmological scale or, on the contrary, there are im-
plications for everyday experiments. The answer implies rewriting (8.2) with
distance rather than angle coordinates; replacing r ,

in the second member. The coefﬁcient r/t

This would be a version of (3.8) in spherical coordinates, were it not for the extra
terms with powers of r/t
implies a
comparison between the distance from the object to the observer and the size
of the Universe; remember that t
is both time and distance in non-dimensional
units. We can say that ordinary special relativity will apply for objects which
are near us, but distant objects will show in their movement an effect of the
Universe’s hyperspherical nature.

With Eqs. (6.16) we have established the refractive indices nr and n4 to account
for the dynamics near a massive sphere using Cartesian coordinates; since this is
frequently applied on a cosmological scale, we must ﬁnd out how the dynamics
is modiﬁed by the use of hyperspherical coordinates. Using the refractive indices
and hyperspherical coordinates, noting that nr = n2

If we want to apply these equations to cosmology it is easiest to follow the
approach of Newtonian cosmology, which produces basically the same results
as the relativistic approach but presumes that the observer is at the centre of the
Universe [18, 23]. In order to adopt a relativistic approach we need equations
that replace Einstein’s in 4DO. A set of such was proposed above Eq. (6.4) but
their application in cosmology has not yet been tested, so we will have to defer
this more correct approach to future work. The strategy we will follow here is to
consider a general object at distance r from the observer, moving away from the
latter under the gravitational inﬂuence of the mass included in a sphere of radius
r. If we designate by m
the average mass density in the Universe, then mass M
in (8.15) is 4pm

r3/3; this will have to be considered further down.
Friedman equation governs standard cosmology and can be derived both from
Newtonian and relativistic dynamics, with different consequences in terms of
the overall size of the Universe and the observer’s privileged position. From the
cited references we write Friedman equation as

3 −

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(8.18)

with L
a cosmological constant and k the curvature constant; the gravitational
constant was not included because it is unity in non-dimensional units and the
equation is written in real, not comoving, coordinates. In order to compare (8.15)
with Friedman equation there is a problem with the last term because the Hubble
parameter ˙r/r does not appear isolated in the ﬁrst member; we will ﬁnd a way
to circumvent the problem later on but ﬁrst let us look at what (8.15) tells us
when the mass density is zeroed. In this case n4 = 1 and we ﬁnd from (8.12) that
˙t
is non-zero, for which we can ﬁnd no reasonable explana-
tion. Replacing n4 and ˙t with unity in (8.15) we ﬁnd that ˙r/r = 1/t , conﬁrming
what had already been found in (8.8). Comparing with Friedman equation, this
corresponds to a ﬂat Universe with a critical mass density m = m c; it is imme-
diately obvious that m c = 3/(8pt
2). Let us not overlook the importance of this
conclusion because it completely removes the need for a critical density if the
Universe is ﬂat; remember this is one of the main reasons to invoke dark matter
in standard cosmology. Notice also that this conclusion does not depend on a

of dynamics.

≈

Let us now see what happens when we consider a small mass density; here
we are talking about matter that is observed or measured in some way but not
postulated matter. The matter density that we will consider is of the order of
1% of the presently accepted value. It is therefore just a perturbation of the ﬂat
solution that we described above and the fact that we are presuming a privileged
observer has to be taken just for this perturbation. The ﬁrst thing we note when
we consider matter density is that ˙t < 1, because there is now a component of the
velocity vector along s
r . Ideally we should solve the Euler-Lagrange equations
resulting from (8.12) in order to ﬁnd ˙t and ˙r but this is a difﬁcult process and
we shall carry on with just a qualitative discussion. Considering that we are dis-
˙t /t and the two last terms
cussing a perturbation it is legitimate to make ˙r/r
in the second member of (8.15) can be combined into one single term ( ˙t /t )2,
the same as we encountered for the ﬂat solution, albeit with a numerator slightly
smaller than unity. The ﬁrst term has now become slightly positive and we can
see from Friedman equation that this corresponds to a negative curvature con-
stant, k, and to an open Universe. Lastly the second term includes the mass M
of a sphere with radius r and can be simpliﬁed to 8pm
2)/3; this has the
effect of a negative cosmological constant; the combined effect of the two terms
is expected to close the Universe [23, 24]. The previous discussion was done
in qualitative terms, making use of several approximations, for which reason we
must question some of the ﬁndings and expect that after more detailed examina-
tion they may not be quite as anticipated; in particular there is concern about the
refractive indices used, which were derived in Cartesian coordinates both by the
author and those that preceded him in using an exponential metric; it may happen
that the transposition to hyperspherical coordinates has not been properly made,
with consequences in the perturbative analysis that was superimposed on the ﬂat
solution. The latter, however, is totally independent of such concerns and al-
lows us to state that the assumption of hyperspherical symmetry for the Universe
dispenses with dark matter in accounting for the gross of observed expansion.

( ˙t 2

Dark matter is also called in cosmology to account for the extremely high
rotation velocities found in spiral galaxies [25, 26] and we will now take a brief
look at how hyperspherical symmetry can help explain this phenomenon. Galaxy
dynamics is an extremely complex subject, which we do not intend to explore
here due to lack of space but most of all due to lack of author’s competence to
approach it with any rigour; we will just have a very brief outlook at the equation
for ﬂat orbits, to notice that an effect similar to the familiar Coriollis effect on
Earth can arise in an expanding hyperspherical Universe and this could explain
most of the observed velocities on the periphery of galaxies. Let us recall (8.9),

Suppose now that something in the galaxy is pushing outwards slightly, so that
the parenthesis is zero; this happens if ˙r/r = ˙t /t and can be caused by a pres-
sure gradient, for instance. The result is that (8.20) now accepts solutions with
constant r ˙j
, which is exactly what is observed in many cases; swirls will be
maintained by a radial expansion rate which exactly matches the quotient ˙t /t .
In any practical situation ˙t will be very near unity and the quotient will be virtu-
ally equal to the Hubble parameter; thus the expansion rate for sustained rotation
H. If applied to our neighbour galaxy Andromeda, with a radial extent
is ˙r/r
1/Mpc, the expansion
of 30 kpc, using the Hubble parameter value of 81 km s−
1; this is to be compared with the orbital velocity
velocity is about 2.43 km s−
1 and probably within the error margins. An expansion of this
of near 300 km s−
sort could be present in many galaxies and go undetected because it needs only
be of the order of 1% the orbital velocity.

In this algebra it is possible to ﬁnd a maximum of four mutually annihilating
idempotents, which generate with 0 an additive group of order 16; for a demon-
stration see Lounesto [14, section 17.5]. Those idempotents can be generated by
a choice of two commuting basis elements which square to unity; for the moment
we will use s 023 and s 014. The set of 4 idempotents is then given by

f1 =

f3 =

(1 + s 023)(1 + s 014)

Using the matrices of Sec. 3 to make matrix replacements of s 023 and s 014 one
can ﬁnd matrix equivalents to these idempotents; those are matrices which have
only one non-zero element, located on the diagonal and with unit value.

SU (3) symmetry can now be demonstrated by construction of the 8 generators

ﬁnd higher order symmetries; Greiner and Müller [27] show how one can add 7

The standard model involves the consideration of two independent SU (3)
groups, one for colour and the other one for isospin and strangeness; if gen-
erators l 1 to l 8 apply to one of the SU (3) groups we can produce the generators
of the second group by resorting to the basis elements s 3 and s 04. The new set
of 4 idempotents is then given by

This new SU (3) group is necessarily independent from the ﬁrst one because its
matrix representation involves matrices with all non-zero rows/columns, while
the group generated by l 1 to l 8 uses matrices with zero fourth row/column. In
the following section we will discuss which of the two groups should be associ-
ated with colour.

At the end of Sec. 3 we used one particular idempotent to split the wavefunc-
tion into left and right spinors and here we discuss how the different idempotents
are related to the symmetries discussed above, suggesting a relation between
idempotents and the different elementary particles. We have already established
that each set of 4 idempotents is generated by a pair of commuting unitary basis
elements. Let any two such basis elements be denoted as h1 and h2; then the
product h3 = h1h2 is itself a third commuting basis element. For consistence we
choose, as before,

to get

s 023,

h1

≡

s 014;

h2

s 1234,

h3

which commutes with the other two as can be easily veriﬁed. The result of this
exercise is the existence of triads of commuting unitary basis elements but no
tetrads of such elements. We are led to state that a general unitary element is a
linear combination of unity and the three elements of one triad

h = a0 + a1h1 + a2h2 + a3h3.

(9.10)

35

Since h is unitary and the three hm commute we can write

h2 =

(a0)2 + (a1)2 + (a2)2 + (a3)2

1 and all the others zero, 6 solutions with two of the am equal to

The only form this equation can be veriﬁed is if the term in square brackets is
unity while all the others are zero. We then get a set of four simultaneous equa-
tions with a total of sixteen solutions, as follows: 8 solutions with one of the am
equal to
1/2
and the other two equal to 1/2 and 2 solutions with all the am simultaneously
1/2. The am coefﬁcients play the role of quantum numbers which determine
±
the particular idempotent that goes into Eq. (3.17); these unusual quantum num-
bers are expressed in terms of the SU (4) generators l 3, l 8 and l 15 in Table 1 in
order to highlight the symmetries. We don’t propose here any direct relationship

the fact that the standard model gauge symmetry group is found as direct conse-
quence of the monogenic condition which itself generates the Dirac equation is
rather intriguing.

10 Conclusion and future work

Monogenic functions applied in the algebra of 5-dimensional spacetime have
been shown to originate laws of fundamental physics in such diverse areas as
relativistic dynamics, quantum mechanics and electromagnetism, with possible,
still unclear, consequences for cosmology and particle physics. To say that those
functions provide us with a theory of everything is certainly unwarranted at this
stage but it is clear that there is a case for much greater effort being invested in
their study.

There are unanswered questions in the present work. For instance, how can
we avoid an ad hoc deﬁnition of inertial mass or what is the true relation between
the symmetries generated by monogenic functions and elementary particles? In
spite of its various loose ends, the formalism is perfectly capable of unifying
relativistic dynamics, quantum mechanics and electromagnetism, which in itself
is no small achievement. Certain developments seem relatively straightforward
but they must be made, even if no knew predictions are expected. Applying
monogenic functions to the Hydrogen atom should not be difﬁcult because the
form of the Dirac equation we arrived at is perfectly equivalent to the standard
one; one should then ﬁnd the same solutions but in a GA formalism.
In the
same line one could try to solve the equation for a central gravitational potential,
being certain to ﬁnd quantum states. It is not clear how important these could be
in planetary mechanics or galaxy dynamics.

Gravitational waves are predicted by the monogenic function formalism as we
pointed out but did not investigate. How important are they and what chance is
there of them being detected by experiment? We don’t know the answer and we
don’t know what difﬁculties lie on the path of those who try to solve the equa-
tions; this is an open area. The sources tensor must be clearly understood and
directly related to geometry; at the moment all densities, mass, electromagnetic
energy, etc. must be inserted in the equations but one would expect that a per-
fect theory would produce such densities out of nothing. In previous papers we
suggested that a recursive, non-linear, equation could be the answer to the prob-
lem but the concept has not yet been formalized and there are no clear ideas for
achieving such goal.

In conclusion, the present work opens the gate of a path that will possibly lead
to an entirely new formulation and understanding of physics but this path is very
likely to have many hurdles to jump and several dead ends to avoid.

A Indexing conventions

In this section we establish the indexing conventions used in the paper. We deal
with 5-dimensional space but we are also interested in two of its 4-dimensional

37

subspaces and one 3-dimensional subspace; ideally our choice of indices should
clearly identify their ranges in order to avoid the need to specify the latter in
every equation. The diagram in Fig. 1 shows the index naming convention used
in this paper; Einstein’s summation convention will be adopted as well as the

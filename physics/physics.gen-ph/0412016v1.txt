Than Light Transition

Abstract

In this work a new mechanics will be studied which is based on
the hypothesis that the change of linear momentum of a particle hap-
pens as a discrete pulses. By using this hypothesis and by considering
Newton’s relation between energy and momentum, and the law of
mass and energy conservation as a priori, the Einstein dispersion re-
lation can be derived as a zero approximation without using Lorentz
transformations. Other terms will be derived as a corrections to this
It will be shown that the eﬀect of the corrections will be

oﬀer an explanation of why the velocity of light seems to be constant
regardless of the velocity of the source, and under which condition
this will be changed. Also a prediction is made that faster than light
transition could happen theoretically under certain conditions, and a
nonzero mass photon can exist in nature. The work is purely classical
in the sense that it doesn’t involve any uncertainty relations.

1 Introduction

One of the unanswered questions in modern physics is whether the photon
has a tiny rest mass or not. From a classical point of view and without the
notion of the theory of relativity it is totaly unacceptable to assume that a
particle like the photon has a zero rest mass. Such a suggestion would be
rejected for the following reasons:

1

1. How come a particle that is carrying energy like any other particles does
not have something which the rest of the particles have in common, that
is a rest mass.

2. From the Newtonian Mechanical point of view, zero mass means that
a particle will be accelerated to inﬁnite velocity by any force no matter
how small it is.

3. If a particle reaches a certain velocity it must be accelerated from rest
to this velocity ; it meaningless to say that a particle has no mass at
rest, or, in other words has no existence at rest, and then when this
nonexisting entity gain momentum it came to creation. Again this may
be acceptable from a quantum a mechanical point of view, but not from
classical point of view.

Even after Special Relativity there are scientists who thought that the photon
may have a very small rest mass. To shed light on this point I will quote from
a conversation between Feynman and a French professor [1]. The professor
asked “Tell me Professor Feynman, how sure are you that the photon has no
rest mass,?”. Feynman answered“Well, it depends on the mass; evidently if
the mass is inﬁnitesimally small, so that it would have no eﬀect whatsoever, I
could not disprove its existence, but I would be glad to discuss the possibility
that the mass is not certain deﬁnite size. The condition is that after I give
you arguments against such mass” The professor then chose a mass of 10−6
electron mass, Feynman answered“if we agreed that the mass of the photon
was related to the frequency as ω = √k2 + m2 , photons of diﬀerent wave
lengths would travel with diﬀerent velocities. Then in observing the eclipsing
double star ,which is suﬃciently far away, we would observe the eclipse in
blue light and red light at diﬀerent times. Since nothing like this is observed
we can put an upper limit on the mass, which, if we do the numbers, turns
out to be of the order of 10−9 electron mass”. The professor asked if it is
possible that the photon has a mass of 10−12. Feynman answered“If the
photon has a small mass equal for all photons, larger fractional diﬀerences
from the massless behavior are expected as the wave length gets longer.
So that from the sharpness of the known reﬂection of radar pulses, we can
put an upper limit to the photon mass which is somewhat better than the

electron mass”. After this the professor asked what if the mass 10−18 electron
mass. Feynman answered “From ﬁeld theory argument the potential should
go as exp(
mr)/r. Then the earth has a static magnetic ﬁeld, which is
known to extend out into space for some distance, from the behavior of the
cosmic ray of the order of few earth radii. But this means that the photon

−

mass must be of a size smaller than that corresponding to a decay length of
the order of 8000 miles, or some, 10−20 mass”.

But what if the mass of the photon is much smaller than that. In fact
L. de Broglie noted that a rest mass a photon of order 10−65 g would be
impossible to detect.

Here it must be noted that, if there is really a photon with a rest mass
no matter how small it is, then this will impose a change on the basic as-
sumptions of the theory of special relativity because the second postulate
stated that the velocity of light is always constant and it is equal to c no
matter what is the velocity of the source [2] . Clearly that is not the case for
a photon with a rest mass, because the velocity of light will depend on the
velocity of the source as well as the light’s wave length. The second postulate
only applied to photons with inﬁnity energy since only then the velocity of
light will be independent of the velocity of the source and it will be exactly
c , and practically there is no such photons.

1.1 The Purpose and Outline of this Work

The purpose of this work is to introduce a new scheme under which the
relativistic energy momentum relation (Einstein Dispersion Relation) can
be derived without using Lorentz transformations and without putting any
limit on the maximum velocity with which particles can propagate, and to
investigate the possibility of rest mass photons.

The treatment is based on the assumption that the exchange of momen-
tum between particles is not a continuous process, but it happens in the
form of discrete pulses. The derived dispersion relation is an approximation
to Einstein dispersion relation (EDR) ; an approximation that is becoming
It will be shown that under such

an assumption it is possible for particles with nonzero mass to travel at the
velocity c and faster, which means that it is possible for the photon to have
a nonzero rest mass. It will also be shown that the new understanding will
explain the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment. The constancy of
the velocity of light will be a result and not a postulate like in the case of SR.
However it will be shown that the principal of the constancy of the velocity
of light can be violated for low energy photons.

The second section will discuss the basic postulates of the work, the third
and fourth will show the steps to ﬁnd the total energy of a particle and the
correction terms to EDR as a power series. Section four will show a way
to ﬁnd the correction as functions of momentum. Section ﬁve will examine
the convergence of the solution, section six will discuss the relation between
velocity and momentum and between velocity and energy, and faster than

light transition, the last section will be for conclusions.

2 The Basic Postulates

In this work there are two postulates and one preposition.

2.1 First Assumption

Particles in nature are interacting through exchanging momentum. We are
use to deal with momentum in classical mechanics and in most of the cases of
quantum mechanics as a continuous quantity. The core idea of this work is to
deal with linear momentum as a sum of vectors of small values each of which
has a universal magnitude denoted by ps, this make linear momentum in some
sense a discrete vector entity. The ﬁrst postulate stated that: I- The change
of the linear momentum of a body or a particle with time has a minimal vector
quantity of −→p s , with ps as a universal constant. To understand what exactly
this postulate means let us consider the change of momentum, say from zero
value to a value −→p during a time ∆t. The interval ∆t can be divided in to
smallest possible subintervals ∆t1, ∆t2, ..., ∆ti such that in each of them the
momentum is changing by the smallest possible value. Since according to
the ﬁrst postulate, the smallest possible change is −→p s, the momentum of a
particle can be written as

i

−→p =

−→p sl

(1)

Xl=1
, where −→ps1 is the change of momentum during ∆t1. −→ps2 is the change of
momentum during ∆t2 ,...and so forth, and

=

|−→ps1|

= ... = ps

|−→ps2|
It is assumed here that the particle was initially at rest. Since the discrete na-
ture of linear momentum is so far undetectable experimentally, this suggests
that the value of ps is extremely small. It is so small that the momentum of
the particles seems to be continuous.

(2)

2.2

Second Postulate

The equivalence between energy and mass can be reached without using
In fact, a work by Poincar´e [3] had led to such a relation by
relativity.
studying the momentum of radiation. Another work by Hasen¨ohrl [4],[5] can
lead to the relation by studying the pressure inside a system composed of a

Munir H. K. Al-Hashimi

hollow enclosure ﬁlled with radiation. Braunbeck [6] had shown in 1937 that
the veriﬁcation of the mass energy equivalence relation by experiment must
not be regarded as a theorem that can be derived from other principles of
less direct and less empirical evidence, but should be taken as a fundamental
principle. This point of view will be adopted here. The mass energy relation
in this work is a postulate (or a principle), but I stress here that in the mass
energy relation.

E = mc2

, the constant c will not be deﬁned as the velocity of light, it will be considered
only as a constant that has the units of velocity. It will be one of the results of
this work that particles with p
moc will travel with a velocity approaching
c. The second postulate is: mass and energy are equivalent.

≫

2.3 Phenomenological preposition

The third postulate is supposed to specify the relation between the energy
change of a particle due to a vector change of one momentum pulse −→ps and the
momentum vector −→p . By knowing this relation, the dispersion relation can
be found after summing the values of energies due to a change of momentum
by i-pulses.

∆E =

To show how this phenomenological relation has been suggested, consider
a particle that has a change of linear momentum equal to −→p s. According to
Newton’s mechanics the change of energy due to this change of momentum
will be

1
mo  −→p bf · −→p s +
where −→p bf is the initial momentum vector of the particle, or it is the mo-
mentum vector before the change of momentum by −→p s , and mo is the rest
mass of the particle. In this work it will be purposed that Newton relation
is applicable but with a diﬀerence, according to the second postulate mass
and energy are equivalent therefore the kinetic mass must be used instead of
the rest mass. More about the preposition will be discussed in another work
under preparation [7]. Accordingly the change of the energy of a particle due
to a change of its momentum −→pbf by one momentum pulse is

where E(t) is the total energy of the particle. Relation (5) will be used for
calculating the energy that is gained by the particle due to the ith momentum
pulse.

According to the previous discussion the state of the proposition will be:
if a particle with momentum pbf changed its momentum by one momentum
pulse then the change of energy due to that will be according to relation(5).
In this work only an accelerated particle from rest will be studied, it will
be assumed that the acceleration process will not cause any change in the
inner state of particle, and therefore the rest mass will not change. If a force
acting on a particle has ﬁxed direction, then it would be reasonable to believe
that all the momentum pulses will be pointing in the same direction of the
accelerating force. Accordingly, for all momentum pulses, θ = 0 in relation
(5). The total linear momentum of the particle after the end of the action of
the accelerating force will be:

p = ips
, and therefore the energy change due to the ith momentum pulse can be
written in the following form

Here it must be noted that quantities like ps, mo, E(t) ...etc. are measured
relative to one ﬁxed observer.

3 Calculating The Total Kinetic Energy

The total kinetic energy K of a particle can be calculated by adding the
kinetic energy gained from the ﬁrst pulse plus the energy gained from the
second pulse ... and so forth. Therefore K can be expressed as

K(i) =

Ek

k=i

Xk=1

, where the delta was dropped from ∆Ek for short hand.

(10)

Expressing Ek will become more problematic with the increasing of k.
This can be shown by calculating E1 and E2 for a particle with rest mass mo

The negative energy change solution will lead to a jump of the total energy to
negative value due to a small change in momentum equal to ps. The aspect
of such solution will not be discussed in this work.

(cid:19)

Here it is important to note that the positive solution of (11) is deviating
clearly from the SR solution, but this will not contradict the experiment since
there is no measurement to energies of particles with low value of momentum
such as one or a few ps. On the other hand, it will be shown that E(t) will
approach the one of SR as the momentum increases.

The expression of E2 will be found by using the expression of E1, because

E(t) = mo c2 + E1 + E2. Therefore (8) and (11) give

It is clear that calculating K in this way will be unpractical. The fact that
ps is very small will help in ﬁnding a series solution so that the expression of
E1 , E2,...,Ei can be written as a power series in ps. For example, E1 can be
expanded as

For large i this will also be an unpractical way of calculation. A rule must
be found for the coeﬃcients of the power series for K for arbitrary values of
i . To reach to this rule K will be written as

sion of K for arbitrary i . To do that, (8) and (9) will be used to write the

To see what these calculation may lead to, a digression would be useful
at this point. Let us consider a suﬃciently high value of i such that in all
the equations from (28) to (35) only the terms with higher power of i will
be dominating and the other terms can be neglected, then from (16) and
knowing that p = ips , the expression of K(p) will be

4 The Series Solution

The generating function must be found in order to explore the dispersion
relation corrected to the j order, that is because one of the aims of this work
is to calculate corrections to EDR and ﬁnd the eﬀect of these corrections on
the velocity. Finding the form of the power series of fj will lead to guess
only f0 which represents the kinetic energy term in EDR , and f1 , which is
the ﬁrst order correction. They have the following expressions

The other series of f2, f3, ... are too complicated to give any clue about their
generating functions. Therefore it is important to ﬁnd another technique
that can express the functions fj directly. The following section will discuss
such a technique that involves solving ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations. The
equations will become increasingly long and complicated with the increase
of the order of correction. According to my experience the series solution is
vital for checking the results.

5 The Generating Function Solution

The change of energy of a particle due to (i + 1)ps pulse can be written in
terms of the total energy of the particle when p = ips . This can be done by
using (8), and (9) that give

E(t)(p) +

(E(t)(p))2 + 2p2

tion moc > ps/2, but this wouldn’t be safe. Adopting such a result demands
the knowledge of at least f5 and f6 in order to conform that (60) will be
satisﬁed. Finding these functions demand doing a very long and tedious
calculations. To calculate the dispersion relation for moc < ps, the mathe-
matical approach must be modiﬁed, that will not be discussed in this work,
only for special case when the momentum is few ps’s, that is when the velocity
of the particle will be studied next section.

7 The Velocity of Particles

The relation between the velocity and momentum is important, it will be
used to explain why the velocity of light seems to be independent on the
velocity of the source, and under what conditions this will be changed.

The relation between the velocity and total energy of a particle will allow
us to check whether the present treatment will lead to the same Einstein
relation between kinetic mass, rest mass and velocity. It will be shown that
this relation will be expressed as a zeroth approximation.

that coincides with experiment.

To prove that the velocity of light is independent of the velocity of the
source a simple fact will be used. If the source moved away or approached
the observer, the momentum of the photon will change, that is decrease in
the ﬁrst case and increase in the second case. This fact is applied not only to
the emission of photons but to the emission of any particle. Performing any
experiment to measure the eﬀect of the velocity of the source on the velocity
of light will not give any indication that the velocity of light is changing as
long as the condition p
moc does not change. To see why, the derivative
of v with respect to p will be found, it is

Munir H. K. Al-Hashimi

From (78) and by induction it can be proved that

lim

dFjr(x)

= 0

which means that there will be no change in the velocity as a result of a
change in momentum as long as p
moc. More precisely the change will be
so small that it is beyond detection. This is a result and not a postulate as
in the case of SR.

≫

In this work the diﬀerence is that, in principle, there could be an exper-
iment that measures a change in velocity of photons, but this experiment
must involve a source moving away from the observer with extremely high
velocity to produce a high Doppler shift for photons that have originally a
very long wave length, such that x will not be big enough to make the right
hand side of (80) approaching zero. Then the change of the velocity can be
detected. No further speciﬁcations can be given about such an experiment
since the rest mass of the photon is still unknown.

7.4 Faster Than Light Transition

One of the important result of this work is the possibility of having particles
that can travel faster than light, but as will be shown later, these particles
must have a small mass in order to reach such velocities. Moreover the
momentum of these particles must be very low, so that the particle can
exceed the velocity of light in a measurable value. The calculations in this
section will be done by using exact relations and not approximate relations
as it was done in the previous sections, that is because the energy can be
calculated exactly by using (8) and (9) when the calculation involves only
momenta with few ps’s. It will be shown next how the velocity changes with
the change of mass for a certain value of the momentum.

This gives

It is easy to prove that the above relation will give v = c for δ = 2 which
means that a particle with momentum ps and mass mo = ps/2c will have a
velocity equal to c. The velocity will increase with the mass decrease further
until it reaches v = √2c, which represent the upper bound of the velocity for
any mass with momentum ps no matter how small it is.

It is obvious that the value limδ→∞ v decreases with the increase of p , and it
will be equal to c for ps/m0c
, which means that the value that a particle
can exceed the velocity of light is getting smaller and smaller with the increase
of p. Therefore the faster than light transition will be discernable only at
very low values of p, and when the particles involved have very small masses.
For the ﬁrst case the mass must be smaller than ps/2c for the second case
it must be smaller than ps/(1.22)c and for the third case it must be smaller
than ps/(0.89)c.

, and limx→∞f1(x) = 1/2 while limx→∞ fk(x) = 0 for
k = 2, 3.... This means that the EDR will be more and more accurate with
the increase of momentum. The derived dispersion relation agrees with the
one of SR for high energies. But for low energies and masses this will not
be the case because these terms may have a considerable value. One of the
diﬃculties here is the unknown value of the universal constant ps. Because
of that it is not possible to predict at what low energies the corrections are
needed.

The ﬁrst assumption of SR that the velocity of light is independent of

the velocity of the source is a result here that could be concluded. This
new understanding lead to an experimental conditions in which the ﬁrst
assumption of SR can be violated. The violation can occur when the wave
length of the photons is very long and the source is moving away from the
observer with very high velocity.

Another important result is it that is permissible for nonzero mass par-
ticles to travel with a velocity of c and faster. This will solve the conceptual
diﬃculty of zero mass photon since it is permitted to all particles to have a
rest mass here including photons.

The faster than light transition is permitted here only under a condition
that the masses of the particles must have a certain degree of smallness
compared to ps/c. If there are no such particles in nature (including photons)
then there will be no FTL. On the other hand, if FTL is detected then it is
the proof of an existence of such particles with such small rest masses. The
results of the previous section show that the there will be no hope of detecting
such transition for photons with short wave length (high momentum) because
from (77) such a photon will travel with velocity very close to c, the FTL
could be detected if the experiment is designed to measure the velocity of
photons with extremely long wave length. It has been shown that the largest
possible velocity of a particle is √2c that is when p = ps and the mass
approaches zero.

Here I must admit that there is no usefulness of the new approach in
applied physics unless faster than light transition is detected and measured
experimentally, it would be hard to justify the replacement of one postulate
of SR with three postulate if FLT will not be detected.

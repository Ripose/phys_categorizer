Symmetry Violation of Time Reversal in Light’s
High Order Nonlinear Stimulated Radiation
and Absorption Processes

Abstract

The stimulated stimulated radiation and absorption theory of light based on low order linear in-
teraction is considered symmetrical in time reversal processes at present. It is provided in the paper
that after high order nonlinear interaction between radiation ﬁelds and charged particles is considered,
time reversal symmetry in the stimulated radiation and absorption processes would be violated. Two
reasons lead to symmetry violations of time reversal. One is the diﬀerence of initial states before
and after time reversals. Another is the asymmetry of interaction Hamiltonian under time reversal.
For single photon’s stimulated radiation and absorption in unite time, symmetry violation caused
by initial state’s diﬀerences takes place in the second order processes. Symmetry violation caused
by the asymmetry of interaction Hamiltonian takes place in the third order processes. The results
means that even though the interaction Hamiltonian is unchanged under time reversal, the diﬀer-
ence of initial states would also violate time reversal symmetry and the diﬀerence of initial states
plays a more important role than asymmetry of interaction Hamiltonian in light’ stimulated radiation
and absorptiom processes. In this way, the parameters of stimulated radiation and absorption are
diﬀerent with Bik 6= Bki. Based on revised theory, the non-equilibrium and nonlinear phenomena
just as generation of laser, ampliﬁcation of non-population inversion, self-induced transparency and
self-induced absorption can be explained more rationally. Other nonlinear processes such as light’s
multiple frequency, sum frequency and diﬀerence frequency, double stationary state, self-focusing and
self-defocusing, double and multi-photon absorption, stimulated Raman and Brillouim scatterings,
photon echo and so on are also enumerated and analyzed in the paper. The results show that most
processes of nonlinear optics are violated time reversal symmetry obviously.

In order to provider a theoretical explanation for the Planck blackbody radiation formula, Einstein
put forward stimulated radiation and absorption theory of light in 1917. According to the theory,
there are three kinds of transitions, i.e., spontaneous radiation, stimulated radiation and stimulated
absorption. Suppose the system have N = N1 +N2 particles in unite volume and two energy levers, E1
is low energy lever and E2 is higher energy lever with E2 > E1. N1 particles are in low energy lever and
N2 are in high energy lever. Let ρ(v) represents the energy density of rediation ﬁelds, A21 represent
spontaneous radiation probability of a particle in unite time, B12 represent stimulated absorption
probability of a particle in unite time by unite radiation density and B21 represent stimulated radiation
probability of a particle in unite time caused by unite radiation density. There exist so-called detailed
balance when the system is in a stationary state with

If the system is in thermal equilibrium, the particle’s population in diﬀerent energy levers satisﬁes the
Boltzmann distribution. Then suppose

B12N1ρ(ν) = A21N2 + B21N2ρ(ν)

(1)

(2)

B12 = B21

A21 =

¯hω3
c3π2 B21

the blackbody radiation formula can be obtained from Eq.(1) and (2). So according to the Einstein’s
theory, the probabilities of stimulated radiation and stimulated absorption are the same. Meanwhile,
in the current theory, a half-classical method is used, that is, classical electromagnetic theory is used to
describe light and quantum mechanics is used to describe charged particles. The dipole approximations
of stimulated radiation and absorption parameters are obtained at last with

B21 = B12 =

~r21 =

(3)

The same results can also be obtained by using pure quantum theory in dipole approximations, so
Eq.(3) is considered to be generally correct. As shown below that the processes of light’s stimulated
radiation can be regarded as the time reversal processes of light’s stimulated absorption processes,
so B12 = B21 means that the light’s stimulated radiation and absorption processes are symmetrical
under time reversal.

However, it should be pointed out that the most processes of laser’s generation and nonlinear
optics are none-equilibrium processes, and in none-equilibrium processes time reversal symmetry is
violated generally. It will be proved below that after high order nonlinear interaction between radiation
ﬁelds and charged particles is considered, we have B21 6= B12 in general, means that time reversal
symmetry in the stimulated radiation and absorption processes is violated.
In this way, the non-
equilibrium and nonlinear phenomena just as generation of laser, ampliﬁcation of non-population
inversion, self-induced transparency and self-induced absorption and so on can be explained well and
a more rational foundation can be provide for laser physics and nonlinear optics.

For simpliﬁcation, we consider an atomic system with an electron in external layer. Electron’s
mass is µ, charge is q. When there is no external interaction, the Hamiltonian and wave function of
the electron are individually

After external radiation ﬁelds are introduced, the interaction Hamiltonian between electron and ﬁeld

Here the order of ˆH ′

generally, but ˆH ′

2 is remained in
the paper. Suppose electromagnetic wave is monochromatic plane polarized wave propagating along
z axis, the direction of electric ﬁeld is in the direction of x axis with Ex = E0 sin(ωt − kz). Taking
gauge conditions ∇ · ~A = 0 and ϕ = 0, we can get

For general situations, suppose electromagnetic wave propagates along ~k direction and ~E = ~E0 sin(ωt−

we have

Under time reversal t → −t, the directions of particle’s velocities and the electromagnetic propagation
would change with ˆp → −~p , ~k → −~k. Let ˆH ′
1, from Eq.(9) and
1T = − ˆH ′
(10), we have ˆH ′
1 is asymmetrical under time reversal. As shown below,
it reads to the result that transition probability amplitude changes a sign, but transition probability
would keep unchanged. For the second order interaction, we have

It is obvious that ˆH ′
2 is invariable under time reversal. The time reversal transformation of total
interaction Hamiltonian is ˆH ′
1 | l > + <
m | ˆH ′
T | l >|26=|< m | ˆH ′ | l >|2. The results may lead to the observable
symmetry violation of time reversal. Besides, it will be seen below that the diﬀerences of initial states
is also one reason to cause the symmetry violation of time reverses, and is more important then the
Hamiltonian’s asymmetry.

T | l >→ − < m | ˆH ′

The perturbation method of quantum mechanics is used in the paper. According to the stander
method of quantum mechanics, regarding ˆH ′ as perturbation, we write the motion equation and wave

from the low energy state | l > into the higher energy state | m >. At present, it is thought that it
is enough for us only to consider the ﬁrst item when ω = −ωml, and only consider the second item
when ω = ωml. Because there exists interference between two items while transition probability is
calculated, we discuss it without simpliﬁcation below. Therefore, the transition probability of the ﬁrst

For general visible light, wavelength λ ∼ 10−7M , atomic size is about R ∼ 10−10M , so we have
~k · ~R ∼ 10−3 << 1. In the current calculation, we take exp ~k · ~R ∼ 1 for dipolar approximation, but
it should be noted in nonlinear optics that the radio of the ﬁrst order linear eﬀect and the second
order nonlinear eﬀect is just about 10−3. Meanwhile, ~R is the distance from light source to atom,
~k · ~R represents the retarded eﬀect of electromagnetic interaction. If the photon comes from another
atom nearby the atom, we may have ~k · ~R << 1. But for the interaction processes between external
electromagnetic ﬁelds and medium, R ∼ 0.1 ∼ 1M with macro-order of magnitude and can’t be
neglected. So the factor should be remained in the non-equilibrium and nonlinear problems of high
order processes. It will be seen that this factor plays an important role in the symmetry violation of
time reversal. Therefore, let ~r0 represent the distance from external light source to the mass center
of an atom or a molecular, ~r represent the distance from the mass center of an atom or a molecular
to the electron, we have ~R = ~R0 + ~r, ~k · ~r << 1, but ~k · ~R0 >> 1 in general. So we can take
e−i~k· ~R = e−i~k· ~R0(1 − i~k · ~r). We have

< m | [ˆr, ˆH0] | l >= iµωml < m | ˆr | l >

On the other hand, we calculate the transition probability of unite time under the limit t → ∞ in the
current theory. By the formula

By the deﬁnition of δ function, we have xδ(x) = 0. Under the limit t → ∞, when ω 6= ±ωml, the
formula above is equal to 0 × ∞. The result is limited. When ω = ωml, Eq.(27) is equal to

Because of δ(2ωml) = δ(ωml)/2, the ﬁrst and second items in the formula oﬀset each other. The result
is still limited to be equal to ∞ × 0. When ω = −ωmk, by relation xδ(x) = 0, Eq.(27) can be written
as

By relation xδ(x) = 0, when ω 6= ±ωml we have δ(ω ± ωml) = 0. So the formula becomes zero.
When ω = ωml, the ﬁrst and second items on the right side of the formula oﬀset each other. When
ω = −ωml, the ﬁrst and third items in the formula oﬀset each other. The last result is

In the discuss above, we suppose that the electron is in low energy lever | l > at beginning, then
transforms to high energy lever | m >, stimulated by radiation ﬁeld and absorbing a photon with
frequency ωml > 0 and wave vector ~k (moving along the ~k direction). The reversal of this process
is that the electron returns to low energy from high energy lever, stimulated by radiation ﬁeld and
giving out a photon with frequency ωml > 0 (or absorbing a photon with frequency ωlm < 0) and
with wave vector −~k (or moving along the −~k direction). Generally, we regard the time reversal of a
process as its reversal process of the process, so under time reversal, initial state becomes | m >, i.e.,
a(0)
k (−t) = δkm. Putting it into the right formula of Eq. (38), we have

On the other hand, according to the deﬁnition of time reversal, we have wave vector ~k → −~k, particle’s
momentum ˆp = −i¯h∇ → −ˆp = ˆp∗ under time reversal, i.e., the directions of light’s propagation and
particle’s motion are reversal under time reversal. From Eq.(22), we have

Because we always have ~k ⊥ ~E0 = 0 for electromagnetic wave, so we get

So ~k · ~r and ~E0 · ˆp commutate to each other with < m | ~k · ~r0 ~E0 · ˆp | l >=< m | ~E0 · ˆp~k · ~r | l >. From

The formula contains the transition processes of single photon’s absorption with ω = ±ωml and double
photon’s absorption with 2ω = ±ωml. The absorption process of single photon is discussed at ﬁrst.
As shown above, for the calculation of transition probability in unite time and under limit t → ∞, it
is enough for us only to remain the items containing the factor {e−i(ω−ωml)t − 1}/(ω − ωml). The other
items can be omitted comparing with it. Let n = l in the seventh and eight items of the formula, we
get

In general situations, the wave function can be developed into series with | l >∼

P
< l | ~τ · ~r∇ | l >∼ <l || l >∼ 1. In this way, we get aml ∼ 0.4 × 10−26E2
0 . Under the condition
of weak ﬁelds with E0 << 1013V /M , aml can be neglected. When the ﬁelds are strong enough with
E0 ≃ 1012 ∼ 1013V /M , the revised values of the second order are big enough to be observed. On
the other hand, if the retarded eﬀect of electromagnetic ﬁelds is neglected with ~k · ~r = 0, we have
< l | ~τ · ~r∇ | l >6= 0, bl = dl = 0, aml = 0, the reversions of the second order processes are zero.

When the transition probability of unite time is calculated, for the second order process with ω = ωml,
it is enough for us to take k = m in the fourth and sixth items of the formula. The eﬀective probability
amplitude is

The time reversal of total eﬀective probability amplitude is

It is obvious that we have amT (t)ω=ωml

other hand, if let ˆF1ml → − ˆF1ml, ˆF1ll → − ˆF1mm , ˆF1mm → − ˆF1ll, we can get Eq.(63) from Eq.(48).
The result shows that another reason of symmetry violation of time reversal comes from the diﬀerence
of initial states, besides asymmetry of the interaction Hamiltonian ˆH ′

we get

When < m | ~τ · ~r∇ | m >6= <l | ~τ · ~r∇ | l > or Bm 6= Bl, we have W (2)
ω=ωml, time reversal
symmetry is violated. It is obvious that the violation is only caused by the diﬀerence of initial states
before and after time reversal, having nothing to do with the asymmetry of interaction Hamiltonian,
for the interference between the ﬁrst and second order processes do not exist in the formula. Deﬁne
the parameter of symmetry violation of time reversal as

Because Bm and Bl have the same magnitude order, as shown in Eq.(48), under the condition of
weak ﬁelds with E0 << 1013V /M , aml can be neglected. When the ﬁelds are strong enough with
E0 ≃ 1012 ∼ 1013V /M , the revised values of the second order are big enough to be observed.
If
the retarded eﬀect of electromagnetic ﬁelds is neglected with ~k · ~r = 0, we have bl = dl = 0 and
bm = dm = 0, aml = a′

ml = 0, without symmetry violation.

The process of double photon absorption with 2ω = ωml is discussed below. Let n = l, m in the
second and last items in Eq.(46), when transition probability of unite time is calculated, the eﬀective
probability amplitude for the process of 2ω = ωml is

We still have a(2)
m (t)2ω=ωml , means that eﬀective probability amplitude change a
sign, but transition probability is unchanged under time reversal. The situation is similar to the ﬁrst
order process of single photon absorption with ω = ωml. Similarly, if let ˆF1ml → − ˆF1ml, ˆF2ml →
− ˆF2ml, ˆF1ll → − ˆF1mm, ˆF1mm → − ˆF1ll in Eq.(70), we can also get Eq.(71). So we have to consider the

the symmetry of time reversal is violated with the magnitude order of | ˆF1ii | /¯hωml. Similarly,
let ˆF1ml → − ˆF1ml, ˆF1ll → − ˆF1mm, ˆF1mm → − ˆF1ll in Eq.(73), we can also get Eq.(75). So the

So it is necessary for us to consider the eﬀect of initial phases. As mentioned above, even interaction
Hamiltonian is unchanged under time reversal, the diﬀerences of initial states would violate time
reversal symmetry. If initial phases are considered, Eq.(9) and (11) should be rewritten as

We still have W (2)
ω=ωml in general. The result is the same for double photon absorption
processes with W (2)
2ω=ωml when initial phases are considered. The signiﬁcance of this
result is that even though interaction Hamiltonian is unchanged under time reversal, the diﬀerences of
initial states would also violate time reversal symmetry. The transition probabilities that an electron
transits from low energy state into higher energy state would be diﬀerent from that the electron

transits from higher energy state into low energy state, no matter whether interaction Hamiltonian
changes or not under time reversal. On the other hand, the time reversal asymmetry of Hamiltonian
ˆH ′
1 reds to the asymmetry of interaction items between high and low order processes.
In the second order processes of single photon absorption and the third process of double photon
absorption, transition probabilities in unit time have nothing to do with interaction items. In these
cases, symmetry violations of time reversal are caused by the diﬀerences of initial states. Only in
the third processes of single photon absorption and the fourth processes of double photon absorption,
as well as in higher order processes, transition probabilities in unit time and symmetry violation are
relative to the asymmetry of Hamiltonian. So the diﬀerence of initial states is more important for
time reversal symmetry violation in the processes of light’s stimulated radiation and absorption.

In the discussion above, we suppose that the stimulated absorption of ω → ωml is that an electron
transits from low energy lever | l > to higher energy | m > by absorbing a photon with frequency ωml
and wave director ~k. The situation is just opposite for of stimulated radiation that an electron transits
from higher energy | m > to low energy lever | l > by absorbing a photon with frequency ωml (or
absorbing a photon with frequency ωlm = −ωml ) and wave director −~k. So simulated radiation can
be regarded as time reversal of stimulated absorption. Therefore, we let Bml represent the stimulated
absorption probability of an electron acted by unite radiation density in unite time transiting from
| l > state to | m >, we have

Bml =

Blm = (Bml)T =

Because of χml 6= χ′

processes is considered, the stimulated absorption probability and stimulated radiation probability are

not equal to each other. Only when when < l | ~τ ·~r∇ | l >= 0, we have χml = 0, q2(b2
the formulas becomes the current results.

The high order revision of spontaneous radiation probability should be calculated by whole quan-
tum mechanics. The problem is not discussed it here, but we can still writ it as Aml = κmlBml with
ml/(c3π2) in principle. Now let’s discuss the eﬀect of high order reversion on raiser theory.
κml = ¯hω3
According to revised theory, B12 6= B21, when N2 < N1, we can still have B21N2 > B12N1, as long
as B21 is big enough than B12. That is to say raise can be produced without population reversion.
At present, a large numbers of experiments (1) have veriﬁed the possibility to product raiser without
population reversion, thought the reasons are varied. But according to the paper, it is a common
result. In fact, particle’s number in diﬀerent energy lavers can’t be measured directly. What can be
done is only the number of photons and we account photon’s number by quantities ρB21N2, ρB12N1
and A21N2. So according to the revised theory, the condition of stimulated ampliﬁcation of light
should become B21N2 > B12N1, instead of N2 > N1 according to revised theory.

Secondly, according to the current theory, for stationary states, we have from Eq.(1)

The result N2 < N1 means that population reversion can’t be achieved in two energy systems, so
three or more energy levers are needed for the production of raiser. However, according to the revised
result, for stationary states, we have

It is possible for us to have N2 > N1 if the condition ρB12 > (ρ + κ21)B21 can be satisﬁed, thought
the eﬃciency to produce raiser may be low for two energy lever systems.

The stander radiation and absorption process for three energy systems to produce raiser is shown
inFig.1. The practical process is shown in Fig.2. The signiﬁcance of revised theory can be seen
through analyzing the diﬀerence of two ﬁgures. In Fig.2, particles in ground state E1 are pumped
into E3 energy lever, then the particles transit into E2 energy lever through nonradiative transitions.
Population reversion is formed between E1 and E2 energy levers and raise with frequency ω21 is
produced. Comparing with Fig.1, the stimulated and spontaneous radiation transitions between E1
and E3, as well as the stimulated absorption transition between E2 and E3 energy levers are neglected
in Fig.2. The results means actually that B31 << B13,so that (ρ13+κ31)B31N1, as well as B23 << B32,
so that ρ23B23N2 << (ρ23+κ32)B32N3. So for a highly eﬀective raiser system with three energy levers,
the conditions B21 << B12 B31 << B13 B23 << B32 should be satisﬁed. So we can describe the
production processes of raiser more simply and rationally by accepting Bml 6= Blm.

Nonlinear optical problems are discussed below. Self-reduced transparence and self-reduced ab-
sorption phenomena (2) are discussed ﬁrstly. Experiments show that under the condition of strong
ﬁelds some medium would become transparent or saturation absorption but some become nontrans-
parent or super absorption. At present, the explanation for self-reduced transparence is that particle’s
number in low energy lever becomes small so that the absorption of light becomes small. Meanwhile
particle’s number in higher energy lever increases so that light’s stimulated radiation or transparent
light increases. The problem of this kind of explanation is that if particle’s number in higher energy
levers increases, spontaneous radiation also increases. Because spontaneous radiation takes place on
each direction of space, it is diﬃcult for mediums become real transparent. According to Eq.(95) with
α12 ∼ E2
0 , if α12 is a negative number with α12 ∼ −1 for some medium in strong ﬁelds, we have
B12 ∼ 0, the Self-reduced transparence or saturation absorption takes place naturally. But according
to the current theory, B12 ∼ E2
0 , B12 would becomes bigger in strong ﬁelds, no saturation absorption
takes place. Oppositely, if αml is a positive number, in strong ﬁelds, B12 would become bigger, that
is self-reduced absorption. In current nonlinear optics, self-reduced absorption is explained by double
photon or multi-photon absorption. According to revised theory, self-reduced absorption can also
be caused by single photon absorption. So revised theory can explain self-reduced transparence and
self-reduced absorption well.

In nonlinear optics, there exist a great number of evidences to violate time reversal symmetry.
Some examples are provided and analyzed below. As we know that the processes of linear optics are
reversible, for example, the processes of light’s propagations, reﬂection, refraction, polarization and
so on in uniform mediums. For example, the focusing processes caused by a common convex mirror
at point A shown in Fig.5. When a beam of common light is projected into a convex mirror, it would
be focused at focus O. If we put a same convex mirror at point B, and O is also the focus of convex
mirror B , the light sent out from O would become a beam of parallel light when it transit out convex
mirror B. The process the light from O → B is just the time reversal process of the light from
A → O. It is obvious that the process is reversible. A beam of white sunlight can be resolved into a
spectrum with diﬀerent colors by a prism. When these lights with diﬀerence colors are reﬂected back
into prism along same paths, white sunlight would be formed again. A beam of light can become two
diﬀerent polarization lights with diﬀerent propagation directions when the light is projected into a
double refraction crystal. If these two polarization lights are reﬂected back into the crystal gain along
same path, the original light is formed. All of these processes are reversible. But in the processes of
non-linear optics, reversibility does not exist. Some examples are shown below.

1.Light’s multiple frequency, sum frequency and diﬀerence frequency and parameter ampliﬁcation.
A beam of laser with frequency ω is projected into a proper medium and proper phase matching
technology is used, the lights with multiple frequencies 2ω would be found in penetrating light besides
original light with frequency ω as shown in Fig.3. If the lights with frequencies ω and 2ω are reﬂected
back into the same medium, as shown in Fig.4, they can’t be completely synthesized into the original
light with a single frequency ω. Some light with frequency ω would become multiple frequency light

15

again by multiple frequency process. Some light with frequency ω would become the light with
frequency ω by diﬀerence frequency process. Meanwhile, some light with frequencies ω and 2ω would
penetrate medium. By the restriction of phase matching condition, other processes would not appear.
Because there are lights with frequency 2ω in penetrating lights in general as shown in Fig 10, the
process can’ be recovered and time reversal symmetry is violated. The situations are the same for
sum frequency and diﬀerence frequency processes as well as parameter ampliﬁcation and so on.

Fig 3. Process of light’s multiple frequency Fig 4. Reversal process of Light’s multiple frequency
Fig 5. Focusing process of light
Fig 6. Self-focusing process of light
2.Double stationary state of optics
The processes of double stationary state of optics are just as the processes of polarization and
magnetization processes of ferroelectrics and ferromagnetic. In the processes the hysteretic loops are
formed between incident and outgoing electrical ﬁeld strengths. In the polarization and magnetization
processes of ferroelectrics and ferromagnetics, electromagnetic ﬁelds change along positive directions
are just the opposite processes that the ﬁelds change along negative directions. There exist electric
and magnetic phase hysteresis. The forms of hysteretic loops are similar to the forms of heat engine
cycling loops. After a cycling, heat dissipation products, so the processes are irreversible and time
reversal symmetry is violated. So the processes of double stationary states of optics are irreversible
or violate time reversal symmetry.

3Self-focusing and self-defocusing of light (4)
The medium’s refractive index would be changed nonlinearly when a beam of laser with uneven
distribution in its section just as the Gauss distribution is projected into a proper medium. The
result is that the medium is similar to become a convex or concave mirror and the parallel light
would be focused or defocused. This is just self-focusing and self-defocusing of light. The stationary
self-focusing process is shown in Fig.6. The parallel light is focused at point O, and then becomes a
thin beam of light projecting out the medium. In order to show that the process is irreversible, let’s
comparing the process with the focusing processes caused by a common convex mirror and a beam
of common light shown in Fig.5. In Fig.6, the A → O part of medium can be regarded as convex
mirror A and the part O → B can be regarded as convex mirror B. If the process is reversible, the
light focused at O would become parallel light again when it projecting out the medium as shown in
dotted lines in Fig 6. But it dose not actually. So the self-focusing processes are irreversible, and so
do for self-defocusing of light.

4Double and multi-photon absorption (5)
In the double absorption process of photons, by laser’s action, an electron on low energy lever
would absorb two photons with frequencies ω1 and ω2 and transits to higher energy lever. But if the
electron at higher energy lever transits back to low energy lever, it either gives out only a photon with
frequency ω3 = ω1 + ω2, or two photons with frequencies ω′
2 6= ω2. In general it would not
give out two photons with original frequencies ω1 and ω2. So the double photon absorption processes
are irreversible. And so do for multi-photon absorption.

1 6= ω1, ω′

5Stimulated Raman and Brillouim scatterings
A beam of laser with frequency ω is projected into some mediums with resonance frequency ω1,
there are two outgoing lights with frequency ω2 = ω ± ω1 besides transmission light with frequency
ω. But if the transmission lights with frequencies ω and ω2 are reﬂected back into same mediums,
the light with frequency ω2 can not be transformed into the light with frequency ω, though the light
with frequency ω can still product the light with frequency with frequency ω2. Therefore, when the
transmission lights with frequencies ω and ω2 are reﬂected back into same mediums again, the light
with frequency ω2 can’t be eliminated, the processes are irreversible. In fact, all of processes in which
light’s frequencies are changed would be irreversible. And so do for Brillouim scatterings and Rayleigh
scatterings, no matter they are spontaneous or stimulated scatterings.

6. Photon echo phenomena (6)
Under a certain conditions of temperature and magnetic ﬁeld, a beam of laser is resolved into
two lights with a time diﬀerence by using a time regulator of optics, then two lights are emitted

16

into a proper crystal. At last three light signs can be observed, the last sign is photon echo. This
is a kind of instant coherent phenomena of light. If these three lights signs are imported into same
medium again, they can’t return into origin two lights. Either three signs are observed (no now echo
is caused) or more signs than three are observed (there are new signs are caused). In fact, besides
photon echo, there are electron spin echo, ferromagnetics echo and plasma echo and so on. All of
them are irreversible.

7. In fact, all light’s radiation and absorption processes are irreversible. We have light’s spon-
taneous and stimulated radiations, but we only have stimulated absorption without spontaneous
absorption. It is a spontaneous process for an electron to transit from high energy lever to low energy
lever by emitting a photon, but it is not a spontaneous process for an electron to transit from low
energy lever to low energy lever by absorb a photon. The processes of light’s radiation and absorption
are irreversible under time reversal.

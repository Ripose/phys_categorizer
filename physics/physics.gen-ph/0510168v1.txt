Abstract

The new model [7] was applied to the femtometer toroidal structures found for
the deuteron in [10]. It was possible to relate the magnetic moment and the energy
of the particle to the torus geometric parameters. Excellent agreement between the
magnetic moment of the deuteron and the theory developed for a time consuming
intersecting 3D torus in a 2D space was found. It was possible to discriminate between
which structures present a magnetic moment and which one would produce an anapole
moment. This supports the concept that there are orientations of the torus that make
it lose its magnetic moment, which is the key to understanding the EPR paradox. The
mass energy of the particle changed with each structure, but the mass density was
constant, which is consistent with the tension exerted on the space as the source of the
particle’s ”mass” or more appropriately said the particle’s density.

1 Introduction

Due to the lack of a better model or explanation, the assumption that the quantum particle is
just a wave, described by the wave equation, has prevailed for decades. Since the electron has
shown a point particle behavior [1], it has been assumed that what is waving is a charged point
particle in a mysterious potential well. This dancing in its ”orbit” (the mysterious potential
well) produces an orbital angular momentum and a orbital dipolar magnetic moment, the
ratio of which is related to the particle magnetic moment [2]. Therefore, the orbital angular
momentum is as real as the point particle. Using this ”charged point particle dancing in
a potential well” to describe the static quantum particle has proven to be unsuccessful in
explaining rather ”simple properties” like the particle density or its magnetic moment. This
has gone so far that the magnetic moment of the proton, 2.79 e~
(mp being the proton mass)

. It
is called ”anomalous”, because it is shifted 2.79 times from the expected value, i.e.
is now known that the nucleon is not a point charge [3] but its description is still attempted
via a wave equation [10]. With all the respect that the wave equation certainly has, this
is but half of the explanation of the quantum particle’s existence and behavior. Therefore,
it is a fundamental error to use the wave equation to describe all the quantum particle’s
properties, particularly if the quantum particle is not moving. This error has produced
enormous controversy because the moving charged point particle should not radiate when
it is in the ”orbit” [5] and should not produce an induced alternate current in a ﬁne wire
approached to the nucleon or electron [6]. These points highlight the need for a better model,
one which describes the non-moving particle as well as the wave behavior described by the
wave equation.
A special quantum particle, the nucleon, will not only have a constant magnetic moment, but
will also have a toroidal dipole moment or anapole moment, as well as charge, volume, mass
and density. The wave equation is simply unable to explain the origins of these properties.
Due to the particle-wave duality [4], quantum mechanics has claimed that it is impossible to
visualize the particle, which is very understandable if the particle is a four dimensional entity
which prints a wave in our universe as it travels trough it. As it has been reported [7] a new
model that explains quantum properties of the non-moving particle and includes its waving
behavior, has expressly stated that the quantum entity must be a hypertorus (a 4-dimensional
torus), the time intersection of which with a lower dimensional world (a 3-dimensional space)
produces said quantum properties. One of the intersections of a hypertorus would be a 3-
dimensional torus. As has been well reported [10], femtometer toroidal structures have been
detected for the deuteron. In this paper, it is shown why these femtometer toroidal structures
occur. What is the magnetic moment of the deuteron? Why do diﬀerent structures produce
the same magnetic moment? What structure will produce an anapole moment instead of a
magnetic moment? How does the energy of the particle depend on its geometry? And how
do these diﬀerent structures produce the same mass density?

2 Geometry and Intersection

As it has been explained [7], the key hypothesis of this work is that the quantum particle’s
properties are the consequence of the intersection of a higher dimensional torus (4D) in
a lower dimensional world (3D), where the measurement is performed. The technique for
grasping how a 4D object would be is to envision the intersection of its 3D version with a
2D space (a plane) and then revolve the resultant through a given edge [8]. For example,
the intersection of a 4D sphere through a 3D space will begin as a tiny sphere that increases
in size up to a certain limit (the radius of the 4D sphere) and then reduces its size until it
disappears. The equivalent operation between a 3D sphere and a 2D plane will be a tiny
circle that increases up to a maximum size (the radius of the sphere) and then reduces its size
until it disappears. Therefore, it is easy to visualize that the revolution of this circle will give
the equivalent sphere of the previous ”impossible to imagine” operation. This is true for the
sphere which is highly symmetrical, as any given rotation edge will give the same result. In

the case of a 4D torus intersecting the 3D space, however, there is a wide number of possible
intersections with the 3D space. One is only concerned with the possible intersections that
gives the femtometer toroidal structures found for the deuteron in reference [10].
In Fig. 1 the cross section of the intersection of a torus with a plane and its orthogonal
projection are depicted. Also shown are the geometric parameters that deﬁne a torus and
the arcs that are going to be used in this paper.
In Fig. 2 the result of the operation
described in the previous paragraph, for a torus that is intersecting the plane through its θ
circles can be appreciated, just as shown in Fig. 1. It is clearly observed that some of the
structures reported in Fig. 6 of ref.[10] are reproduced.

3 Magnetic Moment and Charge

As has been explained [7], the origin of the magnetic dipole moment of the quantum particle
is the consequence of the time consuming intersection of the particle’s toroidal dipole moment
(anapole moment) with the plane (2D space or 2D vacuum). The toroidal dipole moment is

through a plane will produce circle sectors (see Fig. 1 and 3). The area of a circle sector is,

4 Energy and Mass density

In the process of intersecting the plane, the θ perimeter moves a distance θrθ, which will
correspond to a movement in the ϕ perimeter equal to ϕrϕ (see Fig. 1). In the case of an
electron in an electric ﬁeld forming a hydrogen atom, the speed at which its ϕ perimeter is
moving is c and the speed at which its θ perimeter is moving is

energy of the particle is,

Even though the energy equation deduced would be related to a particle under an electric
ﬁeld, it also reproduces the particle mass energy, depending on the torus geometric param-
eters, as if it were a state function.

Once the equation for the energy is obtained, its mass can be easily calculated simply by
dividing by c2,

5 Discussion

The strong resemblance found between the revolution of the intersection left in the plane
shown in Fig. 2 and the reported femtometer toroidal structures A, B and D [10] is more than
a mere coincidence. This intersection is the only way that a time-dependent anapole moment
(a magnetic moment) can be left by the torus in the plane, just as it has been described [7].
In addition it is required that, regardless of their shapes, all these structures must produce
the same magnetic moment. The spindle torus reported as Fig. 6 D, as well as the two
[10], are clearly reproduced
disconnected semi-spheres reported as Fig. 6 A, both in ref.
(top and bottom respectively). The central core observed in both structures is due to the
intersection of two ”separated” sectors of the intersecting torus as shown and therefore, no

8

(cid:215)
(cid:215)
tensor force [10] is needed to explain it. As is seen in Fig. 3, the same mechanism that
produces the magnetic moment of the particle also produces the electric ﬁeld vectors in the
plane and the waving behavior of the particle, when the particle travels through it, as it has
been explained in ref. [7]. Therefore, if one assumes that the particle is a wave, as it is the
current belief, the Dirac and/or the Shr¨odinger equation will describe the wave but will not
explain how a static particle’s magnetic moment is produced. In this regard, the current
belief not only falls short but is also incapable of describing such behavior. The present
model on the contrary oﬀers the possibility of obtaining the static particle’s properties while
its waving behavior remains secondary.
The deduction of the magnetic moment is relatively simple given the guidance reported [7],
where a circular sector is clearly proposed but, at that time, was not elaborated further.
The charge of the whole θ circle and another intersection time was used instead. Excellent
agreement between equations (11) and the experimental value for the magnetic moment for
the deuteron shapes reported as Fig. A, B and D of ref. [10] were found, not only in the order
of magnitude but also in the absolute value. Using all the values obtained in Table 2, it was
− 0.005 10−27 A m2, in perfect agreement with the experimental
possible to measure 4.331 +
value [11]. Therefore, it appears that the mechanism to produce this magnetic moment has
been unveiled. This result, has not been achieved by the current models, which give no
indication on how the magnetic moment of the deuteron is produced.
The θ and ϕ values found are arbitrary, but in the case of θ those values can not be larger
than 1 radian (57◦), as larger values will not produce a wave when the particle travels through
the plane as it has been described [7]. Given that all the θ values were below or equal to
1 radian, they can be used in conﬁdence. The same happens with ϕ values; the fact that
they are not bigger than 1 radian makes them reliable. This is true in the sense that the
intersecting torus is not doing a complete round in the ϕrϕ arc (2π radians) to produce the
magnetic moment vectors, but rather a fraction of it, which corresponds to a fraction of the
arc θrθ.
The equation for the energy of the free particle (15) was found as a new interpretation of the
hyperﬁne structure constant, expressed as the ratio of two speeds (equation 13). However, the
fact that this equation also reproduces the mass energy of the particle, when the geometric
parameters of structure D (see Table 1 and 2) were used, is telling us that equation (15) is
a function of state, i.e. it does not matter if the particle is under an electric ﬁeld or free, its
energy just depends on the kind of particle and how much space it covers. This was clearly
suggested intuitively in [7]: the energy of the particle depends on the tension that the particle
exerts on the space. This tension is directly proportional to the magnitude of the electric
ﬁeld vectors left in the plane, which happens each θrθ
c , hence this direct proportionality. And
it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance rϕ, which is logical as more area
means less tension. This is why the lower energy structures A and B have larger rϕ than
structure D (see Table 1).
As it can be appreciated in Table 2, just the structure D produced the mass energy of the
deuteron [12], therefore, this structure could be regarded as the static state of the deuteron
as Forest et al. suggested, based on other reasons [10]. The other two structures presented
a lower energy but the particle density was kept constant. By using all the density values
obtained, it was possible to measure a density of 1.5 +
− 0.3 10+18 Kg/ m3. This value is more
precise than the same density value obtained by using the observed geometries reported in

∼
of the energy obtained through equation (15) is needed to keep the mass density constant.
The Yukawa potential [13], was used also, instead of equation (15), but the average density
values obtained for the structures A, B and D is 4 +
− 1 10+18 Kg/ m3, which is less precise and
quite unreliable. These values were obtained after using r′ = ~
1.5f m. where mπ is the
meson mass. Only after setting the r′ in the Yukawa potential to the rϕ for each structure,
the average nuclear density (structures A, B and D) is 2.0 +
− 0.5 10+18 Kg/ m3, which is as
good as the density reported above, but happens because the Yukawa potential converges to
equation (15) when r′ = rϕ.
If one uses a sphere as a model, the nuclear mass density of the deuteron would be 2.8 10+17
Kg/ m3 (using 1.42 fm as the sphere radius, two times D’s rθ). This value is very close to
the accepted average value of nuclear mass density, 2.3 10+17 Kg/ m3 [14]. It is obtained,
evidently, because a wrong model is in use. The ratio between the volume of a sphere with
a diameter equivalent to the external diameter of the torus and the volume of said torus in
the case of the structure D is 6. Hence, the nuclear mass density is lower than that reported
above for the deuteron.

It has been suggested [10] that the deuteron structure A is the result of a rotating torus.
However, if that is so, its density would be unreliable (the density of A would be around
4 10+18 Kg/ m3 producing a mean value of 5 +
− 3 10+18 Kg/ m3 ). All this leads to the

10

realization that the intersecting torus is what is important and not its projections in the
space. As it is clearly expressed, mass (a form of energy) has lost its absoluteness; it is the
mass density that is absolute.
According to equation (12), the deuteron yields a charge equal to e, after all the spires of the
intersecting torus contribute to the charge, i.e. the existence of the particle is not complete
until the time te has passed. Since this time is 7-12 times higher than the time needed to
produce the magnetic moment, just partial existence of the particle is needed to produce
it. This result is not surprising, because it is produced when the charge e is uniformly
distributed over all of the intersecting torus surface. However, the charge involved in the
production of the magnetic moment was the charge of the circle sector and since the current
for both processes is the same, there should be a diﬀerence between both times.
In other to avoid having two diﬀerent intersection times, the circle sector must posses all the
charge e. Therefore, equation (7) becomes,

rendering equation (10) again. The fact that now there is a charge diﬀerent from e evenly
distributed on the surface of the intersecting torus is not a problem since it would be a hyper-
charge, i.e. this charge will not be in the plane, and e will only occur during the intersection
event. The number of spires η is now a fraction of a circle, which is actually what is pro-
posed to happens and it is clearly observed on Fig. 3: ”a current is intersecting in the
plane during a given time, producing the charge of the particle and the electric
ﬁeld vectors of its wave. The same current is toroidal in shape producing the
anapole moment of the particle, which is independent of time. When the inter-
section occurs with a given orientation (which is the same needed to produce
the particle’s wave), that anapole moment becomes time dependent and, there-
fore, the particle magnetic moment appears. The electric ﬁeld vectors tense
the space producing the particle mass or energy, the mass energy and volume
of the torus change to keep its density constant”
One may think that all that has been described is a 3D torus, with an intermittent toroidal
current. However, such a device will never produce a magnetic moment, will not have a net
charge and will not change its mass energy if it is deformed, etc. Ergo, all those properties
happen as a consequence of a time consuming interaction of the particle with the space,
which is very diﬀerent and strongly fundamental.
As observed, the anapole moment of the particle is the source of its magnetic moment. Since
the deuteron exhibits both momenta, its anapole moment will be produced when the torus
is intersecting the plane across its equator, as observed in Fig. 4, which clearly reproduces

11

(18)

(19)

(20)

[10]. Hence, that structure will not produce
the structure observed as Fig. 6 C in ref.
a magnetic moment, whereas the other three will. It would not matter that the anapole
moment is projected out side the plane, as its eﬀect will be felt but no magnetic moment will
be measured in this way of intersection. Using this interpretation, structure C’s rθ is 0.45
fm and rϕ is 0.18 fm, which produces an anapole moment of 3 10−47 C cm2. This loss of the
magnetic moment as a consequence of a change in the way the particle is intersecting the
plane is the key to understanding EPR paradox, because this way of intersection produces
the loss of separation by class of spin of particles achieved with magnetic ﬁltering, as has
been fully discussed [7].
The theory for the existence of the anapole moment was developed for atoms, using the
state. If that spin is directed along the z axis, then
shell model. It uses the spin of a s 1
with increasing distance from the origin in the xy plane, the spin acquires a projection on
this plane along the tangent to the circle. The resulting conﬁguration is just a spin helix
[15], which will have a handedness and therefore, will explain the parity nonconservation of
the nucleus. In the present model handedness is intrinsic to the particle and happens as a
consequence of the 360◦ twist made in the θ axis as has been fully described [7].

induced by a toroidal winding. It is clear that the anapole moment must be proportional
[16]. This is in direct
to the magnetic ﬂux, i.e., to the cross-section area of the torus!
agreement with the model presented here. The existence of the anapole moment implies a
toroidal winding current, therefore there should be a timing mechanism to stop such current
at some time in order to produce a constant charge, the intersection time comes to fulﬁll
this requirement.
Finally, this model implies that a homogeneous torus, i.e. the neutron and proton spires, are
interwoven in the deuteron torus, i.e., no separation of particles in the nucleus is needed.

6 Conclusions

Assuming that the quantum particle is not a plane wave, a better description of a quantum
particle is provided, where the particle wave behavior is also included. This is consistent
with the particle-wave duality, where the wave interpretation has prevailed over the particle
interpretation. Evidence that supports the more fundamental idea that the quantum particle
properties are the consequence of the intersection of a higher dimensional object in a lower
dimensional world is provided. Mass is not an absolute quantity and what could be related
to the absoluteness of mass is better described by the particle mass density, which was found
to be constant regardless of the changes in the mass energy of the particle. Evidence that
the way of intersection with the space will produce either an anapole moment or a magnetic
moment, but not both, is provided, supporting the explanation of EPR paradox discussed in
ref. [7], where the loss of the magnetic moment on a given orientation of the particle is the
key to explaining it. More research like that published by Forest et al. [10] for the deuteron
is needed to corroborate these ﬁndings with other quantum particles.

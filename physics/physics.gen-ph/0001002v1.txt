We show that we can know more than the orthodox view does, as one example, we make a new
analysis about double-slit experiment, and demonstrate that we can measure the objective state
of the particles passing through the two slits while not destroying the interference pattern, the
measurement method is to use protective measurement.

Double-slit experiment has been widely discussed, and nearly all textbooks about quantum mechanics demonstrated
the weirdness of quantum world using it as one example, as Feynman said, it contains all mysteries of quantum
mechanics, but have we disclosed these mysteries and understood the weirdness in double-slit experiment? as we
think, the answer is deﬁnitely No.

When discussing double-slit experiment, the most notorious question is which slit the particle passes through in
each experiment, it is just this problem that touches our sore spots in understanding quantum mechanics, according
to the widely-accepted orthodox view, this question is actually meaningless, let’s see how it gets this bizarre answer, it
assumes that only an measurement can give an answer to the above question, then detectors need to be put near both
slits to measure which slit the particle passes through, but when this is done the interference pattern will disappear,
thus the orthodox view asserts that the above question is meaningless since we can not measure which slit the particle
passes through while not destroying the interference pattern.

In fact, the above question is indeed meaningless, and at it happens the orthodox answer is right, but its reason
is by no means right, the genuine reason is that if the particle passes through only one slit in each experiment, the
interference pattern will not be formed at all∗, thus it is obviously wrong to ask which slit the particle passes through
in each experiment, it does not pass through a single slit at all!

On the other hand, we can still ask the following meaningful question, namely how the particle passes through the
two slits to form the interference pattern? now as to this question, the deadly ﬂaw of the orthodox view is clearly
unveiled, what is its answer? as we know, its answer will be there does not exist any objective motion picture of the
particle, the question is still meaningless, but how can it get this conclusion? it can’t! and no one can.

Since we have known that the particle does not pass through a single slit in each experiment, the direct position
measurement near both slits is obviously useless for ﬁnding the objective motion state of the particle passing through
the two slits, and it will also destroy the objective motion state of the particle, then the operational basis of the
orthodox view disappears, it also ruins, thus the orthodox demonstrations can’t compel us to reject the objective
motion picture of the particle†, it only requires that the motion picture of classical continuous motion should be
rejected, this is undoubtedly right, since the motion of microscopic particle will be not classical continuous motion at
all, it will be one kind of completely diﬀerent motion.

Once the objective motion picture of the particle can’t be essentially rejected, we can ﬁrst have a look at it using
the logical microscope, since the particle does not pass through a single slit in each experiment, it must pass through
both slits during passing through the two slits, it has no other choices! this kind of bizarre motion is not impossible
since it will take a period of time for the particle to pass through the slits, no matter how short this time interval is,
so far as it is not zero, the particle can pass through both slits during this ﬁnite time interval, what it must do is just
discontinuously move, nobody can prevent it from moving in such a way! in fact, as we have demonstrated [4], this
is just the natural motion of particle.

∗Here we assume the only existence of particle, thus Bohm’s hidden-variable theory [3] is not considered.
†Why we can’t detect which slit the particle passes through when not destroying the interference pattern is not because there
does not exist any objective motion picture of the particle, but because the particle does not pass through a single slit at all.

On the other hand, in order to ﬁnd and conﬁrm the objective motion picture of the particle passing through the
two slits, which will be very diﬀerent from classical continuous motion, we still need a new kind of measurement,
which will be very diﬀerent from the position measurement, fortunately it has been found several year ago [1,2], its
name is protective measurement, since we know the state of the particle beforehand in double-slit experiment, we
can protectively measure the objective motion state of the particle when it passes through the two slits, while the
state of the particle will not be destroyed after such protective measurement, and the interference pattern will not
be destroyed either, thus by use of this kind of measurement we can ﬁnd the objective motion picture of the particle
passing through the two slits while not destroying the interference pattern, and the measurement results will reveal
that the particle indeed passes through both slits as we see using the logical microscope.

Now, the above analysis has strictly demonstrated that we can know more than the orthodox view does in double-
slit experiment, namely we know that the particle passes through both slits to form the interference pattern, while
the orthodox view never knows this.

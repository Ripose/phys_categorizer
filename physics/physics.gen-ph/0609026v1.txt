Abstract

We determine the numerical value of a constant which appears in the Machian inertial force

expression devised by Graneau and Graneau[2]. We point out that this formula may be not

restricted to Newtonian physics.

PACS: 01.55.+b; 04.20.-q.

Keywords: Einstein; Brans-Dicke; Newton; Gravitation; Graneau and Graneau; Mach.

On the Machian Origin of Inertia

Marcelo Samuel Berman

The advancement of scientiﬁc knowledge has produced, in the aftermath of Newtonian

theory, the surge of General Relativity and alternative versions of it. On a diﬀerent line of

thought, Sciama[1] has put forward a gravity theory based on an electrodynamical frame-

Graneau and Graneau[2], discuss a version of inertia theory, that would be originated in

a Machian Newtonian theory. The consequence of such theory, is the ”new” force law for

work.

(1)

where, ∆Fi

is the inertial force between two particles with masses m0

and mx ,

separated by a radial distance r

, while B is a universal constant, relating ∆Fi with a

universal relative acceleration a between the two objects.

Berman[3] has shown elsewhere that Mach’s principle can be thought of, as the mathe-

matical representation of the zero-total-energy of the Machian Universe. In another paper,

Berman[4] calculated the existence of an anomalous universal acceleration which acts rela-

tive to each pair of ”observer” and ”observed” objects, due to the same Machian principle.

The numerical value of the expected relative acceleration, acting in a radial direction from
the ”observed” to the ”observer”, is about 7.0 × 10−8cm/ sec2 . This result was shown by

Berman to agree and explain the so-called Pioneers’ anomalous acceleration relative to the

Earth, which is aﬀecting both spaceships that travel in the outskirts of the Solar system, in

two opposite directions relative to the Earth or approximately towards the Sun.

Graneau and Graneau[2], have failed to determine the numerical value of their constant

B . By comparing with Newtonian law of gravitation, we may write:

a = π2BG

,

where, G stands for Newton’s gravitational constant.

When the numerical values above are plugged, we ﬁnd:

Though we have found the otherwise undetermined numerical value for B , we point out

that we do not agree with Graneau and Graneau, when they discard General Relativity in

favor of Newtonian gravitation. In fact, it has been shown earlier, that cosmological models

obeying Brans-Dicke-Whittrow-Randall-Sciama relation,

,

which is derived from the Machian zero-total-energy hypothesis, and which models are

based on General Relativity theory or alternative generalizations of such theory, should be

regarded as fulﬁlling the Machian property.

In conclusion, we have found the constant B numerical value, but, nevertheless, we

guess that we need not exclude other theories in favor of Newton’s one.

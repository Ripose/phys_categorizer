The Central Error of MYRON W. EVANS’ ECE Theory - a Type
Mismatch

By Gerhard W. Bruhn, Darmstadt University of Technology, D 64289 Darmstadt

Abstract.
In Sect.1 we give a sketch of the basics of spacetime manifolds. Namely the tetrad
coeﬃcients qµ
a , are introduced which M.W.Evans believes to be an essential tool of argumentation
leading far beyond the limitations of General Relativity because of giving the opportunity of modelling

several other force ﬁelds of modern physics in addition to gravitation. However, as we shall see in
Sect.2, the main errors of that “theory” are invalid ﬁeld deﬁnitions: They are simply invalid and
therefore useless due to type mismatch. This is caused by M.W.Evans’ bad habit of suppressing
seemingly unimportant indices. There is no possibility of removing the tetrad indices a,b
from M.W.EVANS’ ﬁeld theory, i.e.
In Sect.3
M.W.Evans’ concept of a non-Minkowskian spacetime manifold [1; Sect.2],[2; Chap.3.2], is shown to
be erroneous. In Section 4 another erroneous claim of [1; Sect.3], [2; Chap.3.3] is discussed.

the ECE Theory cannot be repaired.

The following review of M. W. Evans’ Einstein Cartan Evans ﬁeld theory refers to
M. W. Evans’ FoPL article [1]. About one year later he took the article over into his
book [2] without essential changes. The labels below of type (3.·)/(·) refer to [2]/[1]
respectively.

1. What M. W. EVANS should have given ﬁrst: A clear descrip-

tion of his basic assumptions

M.W.Evans constructs his spacetime by a dubious alternative method to be dis-
cussed in Sect.3 . Here we sketch the usual method of constructing the 4-dimensional
spacetime manifold M. The tangent spaces TP at the points P of M are spanned
by the tangential basis vectors eµ = ∂µ (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3) at the respective points P of M.

There is a pseudo-metric deﬁned at the points P of M as a bilinear function g :
TP × TP → R. Therefore we can deﬁne the matrix (gµν ) by

(1.1)

gµν := g(eµ, eν),

there exist vectors ea (a =
which is assumed to be of Lorentzian signature, i.e.
0, 1, 2, 3) in each TP such that we have g(ea, eb) = ηab where the matrix (ηab) is the
Minkowskian diagonal matrix diag(−1, +1, +1, +1). We say also the signature of the

metric (gµν ) is supposed to be Lorentzian, i.e. (−, +, +, +).

A linear transform L : TP → TP that fulﬁls g(Lea, Leb) = g(ea, eb) is called a (local)
Lorentz transform. The Lorentz transforms of TP constitute the well-known (local)
Lorentz group. All Lorentz-transforms have the property g(LV, LW) = g(V, W) for
arbitrary vectors V, W in TP .

Each set of orthonormalized vectors ea (a = 0, 1, 2, 3), in TP is called a tetrad at the
point P . We assume that a certain tetrad being chosen at each TP of the manifold
M. Then we have linear representations of the coordinate basis vectors eµ = ∂µ (µ =
0, 1, 2, 3) by the tetrad vectors at P :

From (1.1) and (1.2) we obtain due to the bilinearity of g(·, ·)

gµν = g(eµ, eν) = q

(1.3)
The matrix (gµν ) is symmetric therefore. And more generally also g(V, W) = g(W, V)
for arbitrary vectors V, W of TP . In addition, the multiplication theorem for deter-
minants yields the matrix (gµν) to be nonsingular.

Remark
The wedge product used by M.W. Evans here is the wedge product of vectors A =
Aµeµ:

written in short hand as

A ∧ B =

(AµBν − Aν Bµ) eµ ∧ eν

2

Aµ ∧ Bν :=

(AµBν − AνBµ).

M.W. Evans remarks the term Rµ ∧ qν being antisymmetric like the electromagnetic
stress tensor Gµν . Hence he feels encouraged to try the following ansatz

(3.29)/(27)

Gµν = G(0)(Rµν(A)−

R qµν(A))

Quote from [2]/[1]:

where

(3.26−27)/(24−25)

Rµν(A) = Rµ∧qν ,

qµν(A) = qµ∧qν .

Thus, M.W. Evans’ ansatz (3.29)/(27) with written tetrad indices is

(2.4)

Gµν = G(0)(Rµ

a ∧ qν

b −

R qµ

a ∧ qν

b).

However, by comparing the left hand side and the right hand side it is evident that
the ansatz cannot be correct due to type mismatch: The tetrad indices a and b are
not available at the left hand side.

M.W. EVANS’ ﬁeld ansatz (3.29)/(27) is unjustiﬁed due to type
mismatch.

The tetrad indices a, b must be removed legally. The only way to do so is to sum over
a, b with some weight factors χab, i.e. to insert a factor χab on the right hand side
of (3.29)/(27), at (2.4) in our detailed representation. Our ﬁrst choice for χab is the
Minkowskian ηab. However, then the right hand side of (3.29)/(27) vanishes since we
have

One could try to ﬁnd a matrix (χab) diﬀerent from the Minkowskian to remove the
indices a, b from equations (3.25-29)/(23-27). That matrix should not depend on the
special tetrad under consideration i.e. be invariant under arbitrary Lorentz transforms
L:

(2.7)
However, due to the deﬁnition of the Lorentz transforms the matrices λ (ηab) with
some factor λ are the only matrices with that property.

Therefore we may conclude that only a trivial zero em-ﬁeld Gµν can fulﬁl the cor-
rected M.W. Evans ﬁeld ansatz.

The correction of M.W. EVANS’ antisymmetric ﬁeld ansatz (3.29)/(27)
yields the trivial zero case merely and is irreparably therefore.

3. Further Remarks

The following remarks concern M.W. Evans’ idea of the spacetime manifold as rep-
resented in his [2; Chap.3.2]/[1; Sec.2].

He starts with a curvilinear parameter representation r = r(u1, u2, u3) in a space the
property of which is not explicitely described but turns out to be an Euclidean R3
due to the Eqns.(3.10)/(8) below.

Quote from [2]/[1]:

Restrict attention initially to three non-Euclidean space dimensions. The set of curvi-
linear coordinates is deﬁned as (u1, u2, u3), where the functions are single valued and
continuously diﬀerentiable, and where there is a one to one relation between (u1, u2, u3)
and the Cartesian coordinates. The position vector is r(u1, u2, u3), and the arc length
is the modulus of the inﬁnitesimal displacement vector:

and form the O(3) symmetry cyclic relations:

(3.10)/(8)

e1 × e2 = e3,

e2 × e3 = e1,

e3 × e1 = e2,

where O(3) is the rotation group of three dimensional space [3-8]. The curvilinear
coordinates are orthogonal if:

(3.11)/(9)

e1 · e2 = 0,

e2 · e3 = 0,

e3 · e1 = 0.

The symmetric metric tensor is then deﬁned through the line element, a one form of
diﬀerential geometry

NO! A symmetric TWO-form :

(3.12)/(10)

ω1 = ds2 = qij(S)duiduj,

and the anti-symmetric metric tensor through the area element, a two form of diﬀer-
ential geometry:

(3.13)/(11)

ω2 = dA = −

qij(A)dui∧duj.

These results generalize as follows to the four dimensions of any non-Euclidean space-
time:

(3.14)/(12)

ω1 = ds2 = qµν(S)duµduν,

(3.15)/(13)

ω2 = ⋆ω1 = dA = −

qµν(A)duµ∧duν . WRONG!

In diﬀerential geometry the element duσ is dual to the wedge product duµ ∧ duν.

WRONG! NOT in 4-D .

(End of quote)

The symmetric metric (3.16)/(14) cannot be correct since having a vanishing deter-
minant: All line vectors are parallel. The reason is that the author M.W. Evans has
forgotten to insert the scalar products of his basis vectors. A similiar argument holds
for Equ.(3.17) being dubious.

However, even if one avoids all possibilities mentioned above of going astray M.W.
Evans’ method has one crucial shortcoming: The metric deﬁnable by that method.
As follows from (3.7)/(5) we have ds2 ≥ 0, i.e. the metric is positive deﬁnite. That
is a heritage of M.W. Evans’ construction of spacetime as an embedding into a real
Euclidian space (deﬁning the metric by (3.7)/(5)) that one cannot get rid oﬀ.

M.W. EVANS’ construction cannot yield a spacetime with local
Minkowskian i.e. indeﬁnite metric.

That was the reason why we sketched a correct method of constructing the spacetime
manifold of General Relativity at the beginning of this article in Sect.1. M.W. Evans’
alternative method of [2; Chap.3.2]/[1; Chap.2] is useless.

Abstract

In this paper we discuss in detail the interface between Classical
Electrodynamics and Quantum Theory, which shows up as well known
unphysical phenomena at the Compton scale in both the theories and
argue that the photon of the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be considered
to be a composite of a massless Dirac particle and its anti particle.

1 Introduction

A long time ago, Darwin showed that the massless, force free Dirac theory
was formally identical to source free electrodynamics in a vaccuum [1] In the
absence of a suitable physical interpretation this mathematical identity has
for long been considered to be a mere mathematical coincidence (Cf.ref.[1]).
After all, photons are spin one particles, while the Dirac equation represents
spin half particles. At the same time, it has also been recognized for a long
time - Einstein and Meyer were one of the ﬁrst to point this out - that the
spinorial representation of the Lorentz group is more fundamental than the
vectorial representation [2].

In the light of the above observations we would now like to point out that
the above circumstance is not a mere coincidence, but has a deﬁnite physical
interpretation.

We ﬁrstly make some preliminary remarks: Both in electromagnetic the-

ory and in the Dirac theory, the D’Alembertian equation

1

Dψµ = 0

(1)

where D is the D’Alembertian operator, is satisﬁed by the respective
components. This is merely an expression of Lorentz invariance. At this
point the two theories diverge. This is because an equation like (1) requires
the value of ψ at say t = 0 and so also the value of ∂ψ
for specifying the
∂t
solution. This does not pose any problem in electromagnetic theory, but is
not acceptable in Quantum theory, because the Quantum Mechanical wave
function ψ contains as complete a description of the state as is possible and
there is no room for derivatives as initial conditions. This is also the reason
why (1), or the Quantum Mechanical Klein Gordon equation gives negative
probability densities. So the order of (1) needs to be depressed to make it
a ﬁrst order equation, which infact is the starting point of the Dirac theory
and leads to the Dirac equation, [3],

It may be mentioned that two component spinors belonging to the rep-

resentation

of the Lorentz group are solutions of the Dirac equation (2). But these are
no longer invariant under reﬂections [4]. It is to preserve this invariance that
we have to consider the 4

4 representation

⊕
Under reﬂections, the two spinors transform into each other thus maintaining
the overall invariance [5]. We also note that, as is known [6], the Maxwell
equations can also be written in the form of neutrino equations. Deﬁning a
four vector such that

χj = Ej + ıBj, χ0 = 0

we can rewrite the Maxwell equations in the form

the σ’s being the Pauli matrices and wherein for our source free vaccuum
case, the current four vector on the right hand side of equation (4) vanishes.
It is easy to show that the four component equation (4) breaks down into two
two component neutrino like equations, except that both these equations are
coupled owing to the additional condition χ0 = 0 in (3). This has been the
problem in identifying (4) with the Dirac theory.

2 Photons

In the above context let us now approach the above considerations from the
opposite point of view, that of the Dirac equation. It is well known that the
four linearly independent four spinor Dirac wave functions are given by [7],
apart from multiplicative factors,

It should be noticed that in (6) surprisingly ψ1 = ψ3, so that eﬀectively,
one of the spinors vanishes exactly as in the case of the solutions χ of (4).(The
mass zero four component Dirac spinor does not represent a neutrino unless
an auxiliary condition, which eﬀectively destroys the lower two or upper two
components is imposed [5]). On the other hand, without such an auxiliary
condition, it can now be seen from the above considerations that the source
free vaccuum electromagnetic ﬁeld can be considered to be a composite of
a neutrino and an anti neutrino. It may be mentioned that the possibility
of Bosons being bound states of Fermions, rather than primary has been
discussed by the author and other scholars [8].
We now push the above considerations further and try to understand the
connection of electrodynamics with spinorial representations, from a diﬀerent
point of view.

Let us start with the Lorentz Dirac equation of Classical Electrodynamics

[9]

where

maµ = F µ

in + F µ

ext + Γµ

(7)

F µ

in =

F µν

and Γµ is the well known Abraham radiation reaction four vector.

It must be mentioned that this is the relativistic version of Lorentz’s
earlier equation. The Abraham radiation reaction four vector represents the
energy loss by radiation. It is interesting that the mass m in (7) consists
of the original electromagnetic mass of Lorentz which tends to inﬁnity as
the size of the electron tends to a point, but this inﬁnity is absorbed into a
neutral mass which is also present in this term. As in later renormalization
theory, this is the case where we preserve the particle as a point concept by
absorbing inﬁnities suitably.

Unfortunately (7) displays a number of diﬃculties: Runaway solutions,
which are intimately connected to the point electron concept and the break-
down in causality. However it has been shown in detail that these diﬃculties,
including the non locality are phenomena which can be meaningfully inter-
preted within the context of the Feynman-Wheeler Action at a Distance
Theory (Cf.refs.[9,10,11,12,13] for details).

It is at this stage that Classical Electrodynamics forms an interface with
Quantum Theory: In Quantum Theory there is exactly this non locality or
breakdown of causality at the Compton scale [14,15]. As discussed in detail

4

(Cf.ref.[15]) this is indicative of the limits of our observation at the Compton
scale, and once there is such a limiting scale of measurement, as is well known
(Cf.[16,17], we are lead to a Lorentz invariant non commutative geometry

[x, y] = 0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (l/¯h)2p2
x|

etc.,

(8)

where l is the Compton wavelength.

Infact the original motivation for
investigating (8) was the elimination of the inﬁnities which we saw above.
Incidentally the noncommutativity (8), whlich is otherwise classical, already
leads to the Quantum theory, even in the limit l

0.

It is very interesting that given (8), we can directly deduce the Dirac
equation [18,15]. In other words (8), which we can view upon as a junction
equation between Classical Electrodynamics and Quantum Theory, leads to
the bi-spinorial formulation discussed earlier. Starting from the Dirac equa-
tion (2), we can infact recover electromagnetism. This has been discussed in

→

detail [19,20], but to sum up, the Dirac bi-spinor

has the so called

positive energy components Θ and negative energy components χ. It is also
known that while the Θ components dominate well outside the Compton
scale, it is the χ components that predominate at and near Compton scales.
Moreover under reﬂections, it is known that [21]

which is identical to the electromagnetic potential of the Weyl theory

[22,23].

At this point it may be mentioned that the original Weyl Theory, though
formally correct was not accepted because it appeared ad hoc. Moreover this
theory was set in the usual classical space time. We on the other hand have
a diﬀerent starting point, namely the Compton scale non commutativity,

5

(8) which is also tied up with the interpretation of the Lorentz-Dirac equa-
tion of classical electrodynamics. Let us put this in perspective (Cf.ref.[24]
for details): Given (8), an inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation of the wave
function, (8) leads to

On the one hand, at the Compton scale l, (11) leads to the Dirac equa-
tion as already mentioned. On the other hand, we could view (11) as a
transformation of coordinates

xµ

γ(µ)x(µ)

where the brackets with the superscripts have been shown to indicate the
fact taht there is no summation over repeated indices. The equation (12)
was studied a long time ago by Bade and Jehle [25]. This infact leads to the
familiar Cliﬀord Algebra with a representation for the γs being

the σs being the Pauli matrices. As discussed by Bade and Jehle we could
take the σs or γs in (13) as the components of a contravariant world vector,
or equivalently we could consider them to be ﬁxed matrices and for covari-
ance attribute new transformation properties to the wave function, which
thereby becomes the usual Dirac bi-spinor. The latter point of view has
been considered traditionally, with, space time coordinates retaining their
classical character. On the other hand, if equivalently, we consider the for-
mer alternative, then we return to the non commutative geometry (8). So,
either we have the usual picture in which the Dirac spinor conceals the non
commutative character (8) leading to equations like (9) or (10) reminiscent
of the Weyl geometry, or equivalently we consider the non commutativity
(8), which as seen above can also arise from the classical Lorentz theory of
electrodynamics.

Interestingly (10) can also be deduced directly from (8) without having

to go via the Dirac theory (Cf.[19]).

Finally we can get an insight into the spinorial feature from a diﬀerent
angle. Zakrzewski [26] has shown that for a classical spinning particle we
have the Poisson bracket relation

where Rjk is the spin. The usual passage from Poisson brackets to Quan-

tum commutators leads us back to (8)([11,27]).

In summary, we have shown the interface between Classical Electrody-
namics and Quantum Theory on the one hand and have argued that the
photon of the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be considered to be a composite of a
massless Dirac particle and its anti particle. For a justiﬁcation including the
decay mode, Cf.refs. [28,29].

Addendum: An equation like (8) expressing non-commutativity of coor-
dinates or diﬀerentials can be viewed in the following manner. The metric
tensor breaks up into two parts, gµν and g′
µν is of the conventional
kind, gµν can be written as hδσǫδσµν , where hδσ is an antisymmetric tensor
and ǫ is the Levi-Civita tensor denslity. This is immediately recognized as
Weyl’s guage geometry formulation.

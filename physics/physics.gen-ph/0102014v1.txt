In this paper the physial systems onsisting of relatively moving subsystems are onsidered

in the (cid:17)true transformations relativity(cid:17). It is found in a manifestly ovariant way that there is a

seond-order eletri (cid:28)eld outside stationary urrent-arrying ondutor. It is also found that there

are opposite harges on opposite sides of a square loop with urrent and these harges are invariant

harges.

Key words: ovariant length, urrent, eletri (cid:28)eld and harge.

Heneforth spae by itself, and time by itself, are doomed

to fade away into mere shadows and only a kind of union of

the two wil l preserve an independent reality. H. Minkowski

1. INTRODUCTION

In the reent paper [1℄ I have shown that due to the fundamental di(cid:27)erene between the true

transformations (TT) and the apparent transformations (AT) (see [1℄ and [2℄) one an speak about

two forms of relativity: the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) The (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) whih is

a ovariant formulation of relativity, is based on the TT of physial quantities as 4-dimensional

(4D) spaetime tensors, i.e., on the ovariant de(cid:28)nition of the spaetime length, and the ovariant

eletrodynamis with 4-vetors Eα
and Bα, see [1℄ and [3℄. This formulation of eletrodynamis
is equivalent to the usual ovariant eletrodynamis with the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld tensor F αβ

,

as shown in [1℄. The TT are the transformations of 4D spaetime tensors referring to the same

quantity (in 4D spaetime) onsidered in di(cid:27)erent inertial frames of referene (IFRs), or in di(cid:27)erent

oordinatizations of some IFR. The TT do onform with the speial relativity as the theory of 4D

spaetime with pseudo-Eulidean geometry, i.e., they leave the interval ds and thus the geometry

of spaetime unhanged. An example of the TT are the Lorentz transformations (LT) of 4D tensor

quantities. The (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) is the onventional speial relativity based on Einstein's relativity

of simultaneity and on the synhronous de(cid:28)nition of the spatial length, i.e., on the AT of the

spatial length (the Lorentz ontration, see [1, 2, 3, 4℄) and the time distane (the onventional

dilatation of time), and, as shown in [1℄ (see also [3℄), on the AT of the eletri and magneti

three-vetors (3-vetors) E and B (the onventional transformations of E and B). The AT are

not the transformations of 4D spaetime tensors and they do not refer to the same quantity (in 4D

spaetime), but, e.g., they refer to the same measurement in di(cid:27)erent IFRs.

In this paper we investigate physial systems onsisting of relatively moving subsystems, as it

is a urrent-arrying ondutor (CCC), using a ovariant formulation of physial quantities and

physial phenomena, i.e., the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17). First we examine the ovariant de(cid:28)nition of length

when de(cid:28)ned in geometrial terms and in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of an IFR. We also report an

expression for the Lorentz transformations, whih is independent of the hosen synhronization,

i.e., oordinatization of an IFR. Further, the AT of the spatial length - the Lorentz ontration - is

examined in detail. Then the ovariant de(cid:28)nition of length in Einstein's oordinatization is applied

to the onsideration of the well-known (cid:17)relativisti(cid:17) paradox (cid:17)Car and garage paradox.(cid:17) It is found

that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and, if one wants to retain the onnetion with the prerelativisti physis

in whih one deals with the (cid:17)spatial length(cid:17) , then only the rest length (volume) of the ob jet is well

de(cid:28)ned quantity.

>From this result and the ovariant de(cid:28)nition of harge we also (cid:28)nd that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

the harge density as the three-dimensional (3D) quantity has de(cid:28)nite physial meaning only for

1

harges at rest. In order to avoid from the beginning the misunderstanding of the (cid:17)TT relativ-

ity(cid:17) and of our hoie of the rest frame of the ob jet, as the starting frame for the de(cid:28)nitions of

4D quantities, we emphasize that the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) is ovariant in the usual sense. In the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) one an de(cid:28)ne 4D physial quantities and investigate physial laws onneting suh 4D

quantities in any IFR, not only in the rest frame of the objet. The LT wil l orretly onnet the

results of measurements of the same 4D quantity in two, arbitrary, relatively moving IFRs. Thus,

the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) does not use a preferred referene frame. Our hoie of the rest frame of the

ob jet does not mean in any way that this frame is a preferred IFR. The rest frame is, in fat,

the most onvenient for the purpose of omparison with the prerelativisti physis, in whih one

does not deal with 4D quantities but with (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) quantities (the quantities de(cid:28)ned in (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) spae

and time), and with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17), in whih one works in 4D spaetime but with quantities,

e.g., the spatial length, the time distane, the 3-vetors E and B, et., that are not 4D tensor

quantities. Taking this into aount we show that the urrent density 4-vetor jµ
an arbitrary IFR is determined as the sum jµ
+ + jµ
jµ
− for positive and negative harges, respetively, have to be found in their own rest frames, and

− , where the urrent density 4-vetors jµ

+ and

for a CCC in

then transformed by the Lorentz transformation to the onsidered IFR. Then in Se.3.2 we quote

the ovariant Maxwell equations when written by the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld tensor F αβ
4-vetors Eα
ovariant Ma jorana form of Maxwell's equations. Then the 4-vetors Eα
for a CCC (instead of the usual 3-vetors E and B) and it is obtained in suh a ovariant way,

and Bα, (both forms were already found in [1℄), and also we report a new form - the

and Bα

are determined

and by the

i.e., in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17), that, for the observers at rest in the rest frame of that CCC, there is a

seond-order eletri (cid:28)eld outside stationary ondutor with steady urrent. Suh (cid:28)elds are already

theoretially predited on di(cid:27)erent grounds in [5℄, see also [6℄. In ontrast to previous works we

also (cid:28)nd in suh a ovariant manner that there are opposite harges on opposite sides of a square

loop with urrent and these harges are Lorentz invariant harges. In the usual approah, i.e., in

the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17), it is found that there is an eletri moment P for a moving loop with a urrent.

However we (cid:28)nd that suh loop, regarding the eletri e(cid:27)ets, always behaves at long distanes as

an eletri quadrupole.

2. COVARIANT AND SYNCHRONOUS DEFINITIONS OF

LENGTH

As disussed in [1℄, (and [3℄) aording to the (cid:17)modern(cid:17) point of view the speial relativity is

the theory of 4D spaetime with pseudo-Eulidean geometry. Quantities of physial interest, both

loal and nonloal, are represented in the speial relativity by spaetime tensors, i.e., as ovariant

quantities, and the laws of physis are written in a manifestly ovariant way as tensorial equations.

The geometry of the spaetime is generally de(cid:28)ned by the invariant in(cid:28)nitesimal spaetime distane

ds of two neighboring points, ds2 = dxagabdxb. I adopt the following onvention with regard to
indies. Repeated indies imply summation. Latin indies a, b, c, d, ... are to be read aording to

the abstrat index notation, see [7℄, Se.2.4.. They designate geometri ob jets and they run from

0 to 3. Thus dxa,b
e.g., gab is a seond-rank ovariant tensor (whose Riemann urvature tensor Ra

and gab, and of ourse ds, are de(cid:28)ned independently of any oordinate system,

bcd is everywhere

vanishing; the spaetime of speial relativity is a (cid:29)at spaetime, and this de(cid:28)nition inludes not

only the IFRs but also the aelerated frames of referene). Greek indies run from 0 to 3, while

latin indies i, j, k, l, ... run from 1 to 3, and they both designate the omponents of some geometri
ob jet in some oordinate hart, e.g., xµ(x0, xi) and x′µ(x′0, x′i) are two oordinate representations
in two di(cid:27)erent inertial oordinate systems S and S′, and gµν is the
of the position 4-vetor xa
4 × 4 matrix of omponents of gab in some oordinate hart.

2.1. The spaetime or the TT length

In general, in 4D spaetime of speial relativity it is not possible to separate the spatial and

2

temporal parts of ds, or aording to Minkowski's words, quoted here as a motto, the spatial

and temporal parts taken separately loose their physial meaning. Therefore, only the invariant

spaetime length (the Lorentz salar) between two points (events) in 4D spaetime does have

de(cid:28)nite physial meaning in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and it is de(cid:28)ned as

where la(lb) is the distane 4-vetor between two events A and B , la = xa
position 4-vetors, and gab is the metri tensor.

(1)

B − xa

A , xa

A,B are the

l = (lagablb)1/2,

Using di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of a given referene frame, whih an be realized, for example,

by means of di(cid:27)erent synhronizations, we (cid:28)nd di(cid:27)erent expressions, i.e., di(cid:27)erent representations

of the spaetime length l, Eq.(1). Obviously the oordinates xµ

of an event, when written in

some oordinatization of an IFR, do not have an intrinsi meaning in 4D spaetime. However the

spaetime length l (1) does have the same value for all relatively moving inertial oordinate systems

and it represents an intrinsi feature of the spaetime.

Di(cid:27)erent synhronizations are determined by the parameter ε in the relation t2 = t1 + ε(t3 − t1),
where t1 and t3 are the times of departure and arrival, respetively, of the light signal, read by the
lok at A, and t2 is the time of re(cid:29)etion at B , read by the lok at B , that has to be synhronized
with the lok at A. Usually physiists prefer Einstein's synhronization onvention with ε = 1/2

in whih the measured oordinate veloity of light (the one-way speed of light) is onstant and

isotropi. A nie example of a non-standard synhronization is (cid:17)everyday(cid:17) lok synhronization

[8℄ in whih ε = 0 and there is an absolute simultaneity; see also [9℄ for an absolute simultaneity

in the speial relativity, and for the review on synhronisation and test theories see the reent

artile [10℄. As explained in [8℄: (cid:17)For if we turn on the radio and set our lok by the standard

announement (cid:17)...at the sound of the last tone, it will be 12 o'lok(cid:17), then we have synhronized

our lok with the studio lok in a manner that orresponds to taking ε = 0 in t2 = t1 + ε(t3 − t1).”

When Einstein's synhronization of distant loks and artesian spae oordinates xi

e are used
in an IFR S (this oordinatization will be named Einstein's or (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) then, e.g., the
geometri ob jet gab is represented by the 4 × 4 matrix of omponents of gab in that oordinate
hart, i.e., it is the Minkowski metri tensor gµνe = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1), where (cid:17)e(cid:17) stands for Einstein's
oordinatization. With suh gµνe the spae xi

As explained in [11℄, when suh usual representations of pure Lorentz transformations are ap-

plied to ovariant expressions they destroy the ovariant form :

(cid:17)beause they employ three-

vetor notation, beause they treat the spatial and temporal omponents separately, and be-

Suh form (2) of the LT an be applied to an arbitrary inertial oordinate system in whih the

metri tensor an be di(cid:27)erent than the Minkowski metri tensor, and thus the form of the ovariant

4D Lorentz transformations (2) is independent of the hosen synhronization, i.e., oordinatization

of referene frames. But we have to note that na

in (2) is a spei(cid:28) quantity. Namely it always

has to be taken as the unit vetor along the temporal axis in the hosen IFR and the hosen

oordinatization. Nevertheless La

Let us examine the relations (2) and (3) in two di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations. First in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

e = (γec, γevi

in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, that v0
ν,e
e of the proper veloity 4-vetor vµ
is parametrized essentially by the three spatial omponents vi
e .
Then, using the above expressions for nµ
e , and γe one (cid:28)nds from (2) and (3) the usual expressions
for pure LT, as in [11℄, i.e., the above mentioned Lµ
e replaing the omponents
of the ordinary veloity 3-vetor V. Also, we (cid:28)nd the above mentioned usual expressions in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

In the similar way we use the relations (2) and (3) to write the orresponding expressions in

another oordinatization, (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, of an IFR, whih is found in [8℄, where (cid:17)everyday(cid:17)

or (cid:17)radio(cid:17) synhronization of distant loks is used. For simpliity we onsider 2D spaetime as

in [8℄. Then the metri tensor gab beomes gµνr =

, where (cid:17)r(cid:17) stands for (cid:17)radio(cid:17)

(it di(cid:27)ers from that one in [8℄ sine the Minkowski tensors are di(cid:27)erent). The LT Lµ
(cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization an be easily found from (2), from the known gµνr, with nµ
γr = −nµ
whih is given below. Thus the pure Lorentz transformation matrix La

The whole preeding disussion about the geometri quantities xa, la, ds, l, .. and their di(cid:27)erent

representations an be illustrated in a way whih better lari(cid:28)es the di(cid:27)erene between two sorts of

quantities. Again we onsider the TT length (1) (we use the words - the TT length, the spaetime

length, and the ovariantly de(cid:28)ned length as synonyms) in two relatively moving IFRs S and S′

and in two oordinatizations (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17) in these IFRs. Now, let the spaetime be endowed with

base vetors, the temporal and the spatial base vetors. The bases {eµ}, with the base vetors
{e0, e1}, and {rµ} , with the base vetors {r0, r1} , are assoiated with (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatizations,
respetively, of a given IFR. The temporal base vetor e0 is the unit vetor direted along the world

line of the lok at the origin. The spatial base vetor by de(cid:28)nition onnets simultaneous events,

the event (cid:17)lok at rest at the origin reads 0 time(cid:17) with the event (cid:17)lok at rest at unit distane

from the origin reads 0 time(cid:17), and thus it is synhronization-dependent. The spatial base vetor

e1 onnets two above mentioned simultaneous events when Einstein's synhronization (ε = 1/2)
of distant loks is used. The temporal base vetor r0 is the same as e0. The spatial base vetor r1
onnets two above mentioned simultaneous events when (cid:17)everyday(cid:17) lok synhronization (ε = 0)
of distant loks is used. All the spatial base vetors r1, r′
1, .. are parallel and direted along an
(observer-independent) light line. Hene, two events that are everyday ((cid:17)r(cid:17)) simultaneous in S
are also (cid:17)r(cid:17) simultaneous for all other IFRs. The onnetion between the bases {eµ} and {rµ}
r0 = e0, r1 = e0 + e1, see [8℄. Then the geometrial quantity, e.g., the distane 4-vetor
la
AB between two events A and B, will be represented by the vetor in 2D spaetime, whih have
di(cid:27)erent deompositions, representations, with respet to {eµ} ,
that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the same distane 4-vetor la

and {rµ} ,

In order to retain the onnetion with the prerelativisti physis and to failitate the omparison

e, x′1

with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) we onsider a partiular hoie for the 4-vetor la
AB (in the usual (cid:17)3+1(cid:17)
piture it orresponds to an ob jet, a rod, that is at rest in an IFR S and situated along the
ommon x1
A, and
B, xa
Aee1 = 0e0 + 0e1, and
B = x0
xa
A is deomposed as

e − axes). In the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization the position 4-vetors of the events A, xa

B, in S are deomposed with respet to {eµ} base as xa
Bee1 = 0e0 + l0e1, and the distane 4-vetor la

B − xa

A = x0
AB = xa

ee1 = 0e0 + l0e1.

Thus in S the position 4-vetors xa
temporal part of la

A,B are determined simultaneously, x0

Be − x0

Ae = l0

e = 0, i.e., the

AB is zero. The spaetime length l is written in the {eµ} base as

l = le = (lµ

e lµe)1/2 = (li

elie)1/2 = l0,

as in the prerelativisti physis; it is in that ase a measure of the spatial distane, i.e., of the

rest spatial length of the rod. The observers in all other IFRs will look at the same events but

assoiating with them di(cid:27)erent oordinates; it is the essene of the ovariant desription. They

all obtain the same value l for the spaetime length. It has to be pointed out that in the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) it is not neessary to start in this example with the rest frame of the objet and to hoose

the events A and B to be simultaneous in that frame. The whole onsideration an be done in the
same ovariant manner for other hoies of IFRs and of the events A and B in the hosen IFR. For

any starting hoie the ovariant LT (2) will orretly onnet the results of measurements of the

same 4D quantity in two relatively moving IFRs. The rest frame of the ob jet and the simultaneity

of the events A and B in it are hosen only to have the onnetion with the prerelativisti physis,

whih deals with (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) quantities and not with 4D quantities.

from the above disussion that if one wants in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) to ompare in a physially

We see that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the geometrial quantities, e.g., the 4-vetors xa, la,..., have

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

di(cid:27)erent representations depending on the hosen IFR and the hosen oordinatization in that

IFR, e.g., xµ

e,r, l′µ

e,r, ... Although the Einstein oordinatization is preferred by physiists due to its

simpliity and symmetry it is nothing more (cid:17)physial(cid:17) than others, e.g., the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization.

The oordinate dependent quantities have not an intrinsi physial meaning. The spaetime length

l is an example of a well de(cid:28)ned quantity that is independent of the hosen IFR and also of the

oordinatization taken in that IFR; it is an intrinsi property of the spaetime. From this onsider-

ation an important onlusion emerges; the usual 3D length of a moving ob jet annot be de(cid:28)ned

in the 4D spaetime of the TT relativity in an adequate way, sine it is only the spatial length and

not a 4D tensor quantity.

2.2. The AT of length

In ontrast to the ovariant de(cid:28)nition of the spaetime length and the TT of the spaetime

tensors onsidered in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the synhronous de(cid:28)nition of spatial length, introdued

by Einstein [12℄ de(cid:28)nes length as the spatial distane between two spatial points on the (moving)

objet measured by simultaneity in the rest frame of the observer. To see the di(cid:27)erene with

respet to the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) we determine the spatial length of the rod onsidered in the previous

setion. As shown above in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) in ontrast to the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) one annot

6

speak about the spatial distane, e.g., the rest spatial length of a rod, as a orretly de(cid:28)ned

physial quantity,.but only about 4D tensor quantities, the geometrial quantities - the position 4-

A,B , the distane 4-vetor la

AB , the spaetime length l, et., and their 4D representations,

vetors xa
A,B,..e,r,.., lµ

Instead of to work with geometrial quantities xa

First the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, whih is almost always used in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) is onsidered.

Aording to Einstein's de(cid:28)nition [12℄ of the spatial length the spatial ends of the rod must be

taken simultaneously in the hosen oordinatization. In 4D (at us 2D) spaetime and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

oordinatization the simultaneous events A and B (whose spatial parts orrespond to the spatial
ends of the rod) are the intersetions of x1
e axis (that is along the spatial base vetor e1 ) and the
world lines of the spatial ends of the rod that is at rest in S and situated along the x1
e axis.The
position 4-vetors (in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) base) xµ
Ae and xµ
Be of the simultaneous (at te = a = 0) events A
and B in S are xµ
Be = (0, l0), and the distane
4-vetor (in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) base) lµ
Ae = (0, l0). We emphasize that it is neessary in the (cid:17)AT

Ae = 0e0 + 0e1, or, in short, xµ

Ae = (0, 0), and xµ

ABe = xµ

Be − xµ

relativity(cid:17) to take the end points of the spatial length of the rod to be simultaneous, whereas in

the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the events A and B an be, in priniple, taken at arbitrary x0
S , the rest frame of the ob jet, the spatial part l1

A,Be = ctA,Be = γe(ct′

ABe = l0 of lµ

Be. Then in
ABe is onsidered to de(cid:28)ne the rest

ABe is taken to be zero). Further one uses the inverse Lorentz

Now omes the main di(cid:27)erene between the two forms of relativity. Instead of to work with 4D

tensor quantities and their LT (as in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)) in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) one forgets about

Be and x′1

ABe, Eq.(5). Further, in that relation for l1

the transformation of the temporal part l0
spatial part l1
i.e., that x′1
(at us 2D) spaetime suh an assumption means that in S′
events A and B as in S but some other two events C and D, whene t′
with t′
with arbitrary b) parallel to the spatial axis x′1

Ae are simultaneously determined at some arbitrary t′

De = t′

ABe, Eq.(4), and onsiders only the transformation of the
e = b,
e = b in S′. However, in 4D

ABe one assumes that t′

Be = t′

Ae = t′

Ce = b. The events C and D are the intersetions of the line (the hypersurfae t′

Ae has to be replaed
e = b
1 ) and of the

e (whih is along the spatial base vetor e′

Be = t′

one atually does not onsider the same

above mentioned world lines of the spatial end points of the rod. Then in the above transformation

De − x′1

Ce = l′1

ABe (5) one has to write x′1
CDe instead of x′1
ABe
CDe are the spatial distanes between the events A, B and C , D, respetively. The spatial
Ae de(cid:28)nes in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) base, the spatial length of

for l1
and l′1
distane l1
ABe = x1
the rod at rest in S, while l′1
Ce is onsidered in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)
base, to de(cid:28)ne the spatial length of the moving rod in S′. With these de(cid:28)nitions we (cid:28)nd from the
e = l′1
equation for l1
ABe = l0 as the famous formulae

(6)

e refer not to the same 4D tensor quantity, as in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) but

Ce = t′

with t′
the spatial lengths l0 and l′1

to two di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime. These quantities are obtained by the same measure-

ments in S and S′; the spatial ends of the rod are measured simultaneously at some te = a in S and
also at some t′

e = b in S′, and a in S and b in S′

are not related by the LT or any other oordinate

transformation. While in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) one deals with events as orretly de(cid:28)ned quantities

in 4D spaetime in Einstein's approah [12℄ the spatial and temporal parts of events are treated

separately, and moreover the time omponent is not transformed in the Lorentz ontration.

The LT (2) is the transformation in 4D spaetime and it transforms some 4D tensor quantity

Qa..

b.. (xc, xd, ..) from S to Q′a..

b.. (x′c, x′d, ..) in S′, (all parts of the quantity are transformed), whih

(4)

(5)

7

means that in 4D spaetime is not possible to neglet the transformation of l0

as a part of lµ,

as done in the derivation of the Lorentz ontration (6). However, if one does not forget the

transformation of the temporal part l0
the derivation of the Lorentz ontration), then one (cid:28)nds from (4) that x′1

ABe, Eq.(4), and takes in it that t′

Be = t′
Be = x′1

Ae, tBe = tAe (as in
Ae, whih is in the

obvious ontrast with the formulae for the Lorentz ontration.

Let us also see does the Lorentz ontration, as the oordinate transformation, hange the

e)2/γ2

Let us now onsider the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization. Aording to Ein-

stein's de(cid:28)nition [12℄ of the spatial length the spatial ends of the rod must be taken simultaneously

in the hosen oordinatization. In 4D (at us 2D) spaetime and in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) base the spatial ends of

the onsidered rod, that is at rest in S, must lie on the light line, i.e., on the x1
r axis (that is along
the spatial base vetor r1 ). Hene the simultaneous events E and F (whose spatial parts orrespond
to the spatial ends of the rod) are the intersetions of x1
r axis and the world lines of the spatial
ends of the rod. Note that in our 2D spaetime the events E and F are not the same events as the
events A and B, onsidered in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) base for the same rod at rest in S, sine the simultaneity of
the events is de(cid:28)ned in di(cid:27)erent ways. The {rµ} representations of the position 4-vetors xa

Er = (0, 0) and xµ

orretly de(cid:28)ned transformation.

We see from the preeding disussion that - the Lorentz ontration is the transformation on-

neting di(cid:27)erent quantities (in 4D spaetime) in di(cid:27)erent IFRs and di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations,

and also it hanges the in(cid:28)nitesimal spaetime distane ds and onsequently the pseudo-Eulidean

geometry of the 4D spaetime. Suh harateristis of the Lorentz ontration as the oordinate

transformation learly show that the Lorentz ontration belongs to - the AT. In the same way

8

one an show that the usual (cid:17)time dilatation(cid:17) does have the same harateristis as the Lorentz

ontration, i.e., that it is also - an AT, but this will not be done here.

Although the Lorentz ontration is an AT it is still widely used in numerous textbooks and

papers as an (cid:17)important relativisti e(cid:27)et.(cid:17) Thus, for example, it is almost generally aepted

in ultra-relativisti nulear ollisions, see, e.g., [13℄: (cid:17)that in the enter-of-mass frame two highly

Lorentz ontrated nulei pass through eah other .... .(cid:17) In the reent paper [14℄ it is supposed that:

(cid:17)... ƒerenkov radiation of the harged two-partile system involves the Lorentz ontration of their

rest distane.(cid:17) An experiment, based on this idea, is suggested in [14℄ for the veri(cid:28)ation of the

Lorentz ontration. Moreover it is argued in [15℄ that the authors have experimentally sueeded to

observe the Lorentz ontration of magneti (cid:29)ux quanta (vorties) in Josephson tunnel juntion. In

all these examples it is understood that a Lorentz boost transforms the rest length to the ontrated

length. But, as it is already explained above, a Lorentz boost is a TT transforming from an IFR

S to another IFR S′
S and S′
tensor, e.g., Q(x) in S , to Q′(x′) in S′

. Also, a Lorentz boost transforms a physial quantity represented by a 4D spaetime

, thus again onsidering the same quantity in S and S′

. On

, e.g., all four oordinates as a 4-vetor; the same events are onsidered in

the ontrary, as already said, in the Lorentz ontration, Eqs.(6) and (9), the time omponent is

not transformed and the Lorentz ontration is an AT from the relativity viewpoint, whih has

nothing in ommon with a Lorentz boost as a TT. In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) one annot say that the

nuleus must ontrat (as argued in literature on ultra-relativisti nulear ollisions), or that the

rest distane between two harged partiles undergoes the Lorentz ontration (as onsidered in

[14℄), or that the vorties ontrat when moving (as argued to be proved in experiments [15℄), sine

the Lorentz ontration is ertainly not a relativisti relation, i.e., the relation belonging to the

(cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) and annot be used either to illustrate or to test any part of the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17)

The above disussion reveals the main di(cid:27)erenes between the spaetime length onsidered in

the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and the spatial length onsidered in the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) The same example

(a rod at rest in S ) is investigated in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) Se.2.1, and in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) this

setion. The (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) deals with 4D quantities in 4D spaetime. We assoiate with the

(in whih the rod is moving) and in two oordinatizations, (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17). Four di(cid:27)erent

mentioned rod a 4D quantity - a distane 4-vetor la
S and S′
deompositions, representations, are found for the same la
and S′
are onneted by the TT - the LT. In terms of la
and it does have the same value for al l four representations of la

AB. Di(cid:27)erent representations of la

AB in S
AB the spaetime length l (1) is onstruted
AB. An essentially di(cid:27)erent treat-

AB, and onsider this quantity la

AB in two IFRs

ment of that rod is performed in the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) This form of relativity does not deal with 4D

quantities in 4D spaetime. In the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) we assoiate with that rod four di(cid:27)erent spatial

lengths, i.e., four di(cid:27)erent 3D quantities in 4D spaetime ; in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) base they are l1
CDe in S′, and in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) base they are l1
l′1
but in di(cid:27)erent IFRs are onneted by the AT - the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17); l1
(6), and l1

ABe in S and
GHr in S′. The quantities in the same base

GHr with (9). None of these quantities is well de(cid:28)ned in 4D spaetime. We

ABe and l′1

EF r and l′1

onlude from the whole previous onsideration that when the 4D struture of our spaetime is

orretly taken into aount then there is no plae for the Lorentz ontration formulae, and only

the spaetime length and the spaetime quantities are wel l de(cid:28)ned quantities.

2.3. (cid:17)Car and garage paradox(cid:17)

In the previous setions we have examined the main harateristis of both forms of relativity.

Now we want to show the di(cid:27)erene between the treatments of relatively moving systems in the

(cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) Usually suh systems are treated in a nonovariant manner,

i.e., in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) but here we shall present the treatment of suh systems in a manifestly

ovariant manner, i.e., in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) In order to see the di(cid:27)erenes between both treat-

ments we do not need to work ompletely in geometrial terms, but we an hoose some spei(cid:28)

oordinatization, e.g., the simplest one, the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. Therefore, in the following, we

restrit ourselves to the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and, for simpliity in notation, we omit the subsript

-e- in all quantities. However, we shall often write the important relations in geometrial terms, and

also we shall explain whih results and onlusions are independent of the hosen oordinatization.

. Suh an arbitrariness in l, although not forbidden by any physial law, would ompliate both

theory and experiment. Furhermore, one wants to retain the onnetion with the prerelativisti

onept of the spatial length. Therefore, the most onvenient hoie for the frame in whih the time

omponent l′0
AB of l

A,B are determined
AB = 0, and the spaetime length l beomes in S, the rest frame of
ABlABi)1/2 = l0 , as in the prerelativisti physis.

A = l0

The observers in all other IFRs will look at the same events but assoiating with them di(cid:27)erent

oordinates; they all (cid:28)nd (measure) the same value l = l0 for the spaetime length. Note, as we have
mentioned, that if l0

will ontain the time omponent l′0

AB = 0 then l

We one again emphasize that the hoie of the rest frame of the ob jet as the starting frame for

the onsideration is not ditated by physial requirements. This hoie is, in fat, determined only

by our desire to have a quantity that orresponds in the 4D spaetime to the prerelativisti spatial

length. As already said at the end of Se.2.1 the usual 3D length of a moving ob jet annot be

de(cid:28)ned in the 4D spaetime, i.e., in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17), in an adequate way. Only the spaetime

length l does have a de(cid:28)nite theoretial and experimental meaning and it is an invariant quantity.

This holds for all possible synhronizations. With our hoie of the rest frame of the ob jet as the

starting frame, i.e., with l = l0, the spatial rest length determined simultaneously in S obtains the
properties of the spaetime length l. Then, the oordinate measurements of x

′µ
A,B in an IFR S′

in

whih an ob jet is moving are not of interest in their own right but they have to enable one to

(cid:28)nd the rest spatial length l0 . In the prerelativisti (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) piture, and in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) one

an ompare the spatial lengths of two relatively moving ob jets. But in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the

spaetime lengths (that ontain both spatial and temporal parts) are well de(cid:28)ned quantities in 4D

spaetime and they, or the rest spatial lengths, an be ompared in a physially meaningful way.

Let us illustrate the preeding disussion onsidering the well-known (cid:17)Car and garage paradox(cid:17)

(see, e.g., [7℄, p.9). The ommon assertion about this (cid:17)paradox(cid:17) is that it omes out due to, [7℄:

(cid:17)The lak of a notion of absolute simultaneity in speial relativity ....,(cid:17) and onsequently due to

the relativity of the Lorentz ontration. However, as disussed above, the relativity of simultane-

ity is a oordinate dependent e(cid:27)et and, for example, for ε = 0, [8℄, the absolute simultaneity is

preserved. Also, the Lorentz ontration is an AT and it has nothing to do with the 4D pseudo-

Eulidean geometry of the speial relativity. Therefore, we disuss this (cid:17)paradox(cid:17) using ovariant

4D quantities, i.e., in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17). But for our purposes, as it is already explained, there

is no need to disuss the (cid:17)paradox(cid:17) in geometrial terms, than it an be onsidered in the inertial

oordinate systems with the Minkowski metri tensors, that is in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. The

frame in whih a garage is at rest is denoted by S while that one in whih a ar is at rest by S′
The unprimed quantities are in S and the primed ones in S′
here with 2D spaetime. The garage and the ar are along the ommon x1, x′1− axes, and they
are of equal proper lengths lg = l′
c = l. First we onsider the (cid:17)paradox(cid:17) in the S frame. The
distane 4-vetor lµ
g for the garage is determined diretly in S . However the distane 4-vetor lµ
c
for the moving ar in S has to be determined in suh a way that one (cid:28)rst (cid:28)nds it in the ar own
rest frame S′
, and then transforms it by the LT to the rest frame of the garage S . This proedure

. Instead of 4D spaetime we work

.

follows from the preeding general disussion where it is shown that only the rest length, i.e., the

invariant spaetime length, of a moving ob jet is well de(cid:28)ned quantity in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17). The

Bg = (0, l), and the distane 4-vetor is lµ

position 4-vetors of the spatial end points A and B of the garage in S are taken to be xµ
Ag = (0, 0)
and xµ
Ag = (0, l). (In the remaining part of
this paper we shall use A, B, C, D, ... and A′, B′, ... to denote the spatial points on the (moving)
ob jet.) The invariant spaetime length of the garage is lg = (lµ
with the ar, moves relative to S with 4-veloity vµ = (γc, γV ), γ = (1 − β2)1/2, β = V /c. Let the
origin of S′

left end of the garage A attahed to it) at the moment t = t′ = 0. The position 4-vetors of the

(with the left end of the ar A′

in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) nothing ould be said whether the moving ar (cid:28)t into the garage or not,

as the omparison of the spatial parts of the distane 4-vetors for the garage and the ar has no

physial meaning. (Note that there is a dilatation of the spatial part of the moving ar, and not

the Lorentz ontration as in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17).) Only if both ob jets are relatively at rest their

spatial parts an be ompared in physially meaningful sense. The same onlusions hold from the

point of view of the observer in S′

, or any other IFR. These onlusions hold not only for Einstein's

oordinatization (whih is used here) but for any other possible oordinatization of IFRs.

3. CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR AND EXTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELDS

IN THE (cid:17)TT RELATIVITY(cid:17)

Let us now apply these ideas to the onsideration of a CCC in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17). An in(cid:28)nite

straight wire with a steady urrent is situated along the x1
diretion and aordingly eletrons move in +x1

axis. A urrent is (cid:29)owing in −x1

diretion. We suppose that positive and negative

harge densities are of equal magnitude when both subsystems are relatively at rest, i.e., before a

urrent is established in the wire. In a CCC the wire (i.e., the ions) is supposed to be at rest in S ,
while the eletrons are at rest in S′

.

Before determining the urrent density 4-vetors jµ

in S and S′

we give the manifestly ovariant

de(cid:28)nition of a harge within a boundary δH of an arbitrary hypersurfae H (see, e.g., [16℄, [17℄),

QδH =

jµdσµ,

ZH

(10)

where dσµ
is the 4-vetor of an element of the hypersurfae H . (This expression an be written
in a more general form, i.e., in geometrial terms, replaing Greek index µ by the abstrat index
a.) The invariane of harge de(cid:28)ned by (10) is proved in [16℄ for a linear CCC, and also for the
general ase of 4D spaetime in [17℄. If the hypersurfae H is hosen in the rest frame of harges
in suh a way that it is the spae-like plane t = const., then the harge dQ is given as in the
has only the time omponent j0 = cρ, sine we
prerelativisti physis dQ = ρdV ; the 4-vetor jµ
are in the rest frame of harges, and dσµ also has only time omponent whih is the synhronously
de(cid:28)ned rest volume dV . Consequently, the harge density ρ is de(cid:28)ned as the ratio of dQ given

by (10), but taken simultaneously in the rest frame of the harges, and the synhronously de(cid:28)ned

rest volume dV, ρ = dQ/dV, and it is well de(cid:28)ned quantity from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint.

Obviously the harge density has the ommon prerelativisti meaning only in the rest frame of the

harges. The harge density of moving harges is not a well de(cid:28)ned quantity from the (cid:17)TT relativ-

ity(cid:17) point of view in the same way as the spatial length or the volume of a moving ob jet are not

orretly de(cid:28)ned quantities in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17). This is in ontrast with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and

the Lorentz ontration, where the harge density of the moving harges is de(cid:28)ned; it is enhaned

by γ = (1 − β2)1/2
moving volume. Thereby, when determining the urrent density 4-vetor jµ

relative to the proper harge density due to the Lorentz ontration of the

in some IFR in whih

the harges are moving one (cid:28)rst has to (cid:28)nd that vetor in the rest frame of the harges, where

the spae omponent j = 0 and γ = 1, and then to transform by the LT so determined jµ

to the

onsidered IFR. Aording to this onsideration the simplest and the orret way, from the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) viewpoint, to determine the urrent density 4-vetor jµ
following: The urrent density 4-vetors jµ

+ and jµ

− for positive and negative harges, respetively,

in some IFR for a CCC is the

have to be determined in their rest frames and then transformed by the LT to the given IFR.

It has to be noted that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) it is not neessary to determine jµ

for a CCC, in

an arbitrary IFR, in the mentioned way. In that frame we ould start in (10) with an arbitrary

spae-like hypersurfae H and determine ja

and dσa

in some oordinatization that is di(cid:27)erent than

the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. But then we loose the onnetion with the prerelativisti notions, the

harge density ρ, the urrent density j (3-vetor), the spatial length and volume, et., and with the

11

prerelativisti relation dQ = ρdV.

3.1. The urrent density jµ

in the ions' rest frame S

Hene, the urrent density 4-vetor in S , for the onsidered wire with urrent, is jµ = jµ

+ + jµ

Eqs. (11) and (12) are in ontrast to all previous works from the time of Clausius, Clausius hy-

pothesis, see [18℄, until today. In the Clausius hypothesis it is simply supposed that in the ions' rest

frame S the harge density of the moving eletrons ρ− = −ρ0. However the same equations were

already obtained in [5℄, where the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) with the Lorentz ontration is used. This may

seem surprising that the same equations exist in [5℄ (with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)) and here, where the

(cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) is onsidered and thus only the ovariant quantities are used. But, we must note

that the results obtained in [5℄ are not atually based on the AT, i.e., on the Lorentz ontration,

than on the assumption that in the eletrons' rest frame S′
− is
= −ρ0. In a ovariant approah, i.e., in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) Eq. (11) is neither hypothesis (as in

the eletrons' harge density ρ′

the traditional approah) nor the assumption (as in [5℄), but it is a onsequene of the ovariant

de(cid:28)nition of an invariant harge (10) and of the invariane of the rest length, i.e., it resulted from

the use of orretly de(cid:28)ned ovariant quantities.

3.2. The F αβ

and the Eα, Bα

formulations of eletrodynamis

Having determined the soures jµ

with urrent. One way is to start with the ovariant Maxwell equations with F αβ
∗F αβ

and its dual

we (cid:28)nd the eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds for that in(cid:28)nite wire

∂αF aβ = −jβ/ε0c,

∂α

∗

F αβ = 0

where

is the totally skew-symmetri Levi-Civita pseudotensor.

In suh a ovariant formulation F

is the primary quantity; it is the solution of (13), or the

∗F αβ = −(1/2)εαβγδFγδ and εαβγδ

αβ

orresponding wave equation

∂σ∂σFαβ − (1/ε0c)(∂β jα − ∂αjβ) = 0,

and it onveys all the information about the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld. There is no need to introdue

either the intermediate eletromagneti 4-potential Aµ
or the onnetion of the omponents of F αβ
with the usual 3-vetors E and B. The general solution in the retarded representation of (14) or

(13) is

F αβ(xµ) = (2k/iπc)

(15)

12

primed quantities replaing the unprimed ones, sine the transformations of all quantities in (13)

are (cid:21) the TT.

Instead of to work with F αβ

- formulation one an equivalently use the Eα, Bα

- formulation,

whih is presented in [1℄ and [3℄.

It is shown there that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) one has to use

the 4-vetors Eα
instead of the usual 3-vetors E and B. The usual transformations of E
and B, obtained by the identi(cid:28)ation of the omponents of E and B with the omponents of F αβ
(Ei = F 0i

and Bi =∗ F 0i

and Bα

), are shown to be the AT referring to the same measurements in di(cid:27)erent

IFRs and not to the same quantity, see [1℄ and [3℄. In that way it is found in [1℄ (and [3℄) that

ontrary to the ommon belief the usual nonovariant formulation with the 3-vetors E and B is
not equivalent to the ovariant formulations. Eα

and Bα

are determined by the ovariant Maxwell

equations derived in [1℄ (and [3℄),

µν vµEν) + c∂α(εαβµνBµvν) = −jβ/ε0,

We note that it is possible to write the equations (16) in a somewhat simpler form, the ovariant

Ma jorana form, introduing Ψα = Eα − icBα. Then the ovariant Ma jorana form of Maxwell's

We shall not further disuss the ovariant Ma jorana formulation sine it will be reported elsewhere.

3.3. Eα

for a CCC in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

Instead of to solve (16) or (17) to (cid:28)nd Eα

and Bα

for a CCC we (cid:28)rst (cid:28)nd F αβ

from (15)

inserting into it jµ
[1℄ (and [3℄), whih onnet F αβ

and Eα, Bα

- ovariant formulations,

from (12) and performing the integration. Then we use the relations given in

∗
Eα = (1/c)F αβvβ, Bα = (1/c2)

F αβvβ.

(20)

The inverse relations onneting the Eα, Bα

and F αβ

- ovariant formulations are also given in [1℄

(and [3℄) and they are

F αβ = (1/c)δαβ

µν vµEν + εαβµνBµvν,

F αβ = δαβ

µν vµBν + (1/c)εαβµνvµEν.

∗

(21)

Taking that the family of observers who measures Eα
one (cid:28)nds from (20) that E0 = 0, Ei = F 0i

whene

is at rest in the S frame, i.e., that vµ = (−c, 0)

E1 = 0, E2 = 2k(1 − γ)ρ0y(y2 + z2)

−1, E3 = 2k(1 − γ)ρ0z(y2 + z2)

−1.

(22)

The equation (22) shows that the observer who is at rest relative to a wire with steady urrent wil l

see, i.e., measure, the seond order eletri (cid:28)eld outside suh a CCC. Thus the result whih is

for suh (cid:28)elds predited on di(cid:27)erent grounds in [5℄ is proved to be orret in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

too, i.e., when all quantities are treated in a ovariant manner, see the disussion at the end of

Se.3.1. We thus (cid:28)nd that these eletri (cid:28)elds naturally ome out in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) treatment

of physial systems onsisting of relatively moving subsystems. Suh (cid:28)elds were not searhed for

and, it seems, were not observed earlier due to their extreme smallness. (To be more preise, the

13

similar seond-order eletri (cid:28)elds (∝ v2/c2

) have been deteted in [18℄ and [19℄, but it is not sure

that they are aused by the e(cid:27)et predited in [5℄ and here.) However, I suppose that suh (cid:28)elds

must play an important role in many physial phenomena with steady urrents, partiularly in

tokamaks and astrophysis, where high urrents exist, and in superondutors, where the eletri

(cid:28)elds of zeroth order outside CCCs are absent, (see [20℄).

Similarly, the magneti (cid:28)eld 4-vetor Bµ

F αβ

(15). For the observers with vµ = (−c, 0) one (cid:28)nds B0 = 0 and Bi = (−1/c)∗F i0. In terms

an be also obtained from (20) and the expression for

∗F i0

we (cid:28)nd for Bi

wire with urrent, (only the urrent density is γ times bigger).

the usual expression for the magneti (cid:28)eld of an in(cid:28)nite straight

4. CHARGES ON A CURRENT LOOP IN THE (cid:17)TT RELATIVITY(cid:17)

In this setion we disuss the marosopi harge of a square loop with a steady urrent in the

(cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17). This is already disussed in numerous previous works but from the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)

viewpoint by using the synhronous de(cid:28)nition of length and the Lorentz ontration. Let a square

loop is at rest in the x, y−plane in an IFR S . The spatial x, y−oordinates of the orners are:
A(0, 0), B(1, 0), E(1, 1), F (0, 1). The eletrons move from A to B in the AB side. We (cid:28)rst onsider
the harge in the AB side in two frames; in S , the ions' rest frame, and S′
frame. The evaluation of the harge in the AB side in S and S′
AB using (10) is already orretly
performed in [16℄. However there is an important di(cid:27)erene between the alulation of QAB in [16℄
and in this paper. In [16℄ the harge density of the eletrons in S′
AB is not spei(cid:28)ed but simply
taken to have some undetermined value −λ and its value in S is found by means of the LT. The
ovariane of the de(cid:28)nition (10) (the Lorentz salar) will yield that QAB in S is equal to Q′
S′
AB for any hoie of −λ. Our disussion of an in(cid:28)nite wire with a urrent reveals that ρ′
′µ
− in S′
j

AB in
− and
− in S is obtained by the LT, and it is given by (12).

AB are determined by (11). Then jµ

AB , the eletrons' rest

Hene, we (cid:28)nd from (10) that

QAB = (1/c)

(j0

+ + j0

−)dx = (1 − γ)ρ0l

(23)

This result is already found in [5℄. Similarly, to (cid:28)nd Q′
jµ
+ = (cρ0, 0), and then by the LT one obtains j
AB , for the moving
loop in S′
AB , is found from (10) in the same way as in [16℄ and it is, of ourse, equal to QAB . The
evaluation of QEF in the EF side, whih is parallel to the AB side, proeeds in the same way as
for QAB . However the relative veloity of the S′
EF side, and the S frame is now vµ = (γc, −γv). Hene, jµ

AB in S′
′µ
+ = (cγρ0, −cγβρ0) in S′

AB one (cid:28)rst determines jµ

EF frame, the rest frame for the eletrons in the

− = (−cγρ0, cγβρ0) and

− is now jµ

AB . Q′

+ in S,

QEF = (1/c)

(j0

+ + j0

−)dx = −QAB.

Thus we (cid:28)nd that there are harges QAB and −QAB on the sides AB and EF , respetively, in
the S frame in whih the loop is at rest. Aording to (10) QEF is an invariant harge, hene
Q′
EF for the moving loop is = QEF = −QAB . Moreover, it an be immediately onluded that
the harge QBE , in S , in the vertial side BEmust be the same as QAB ; it is the simple hange
of the spatial axes x and y. Thus QBE = QAB . Similarly the harge QF A , in S , in the vertial
side F A is QF A = −QAB . The total harge in S , the rest frame of the loop with urrent, is zero
Q = QAB + QBE + QEF + QF A = 0, as it must be. It remains zero in every IFR sine the harges

in all sides are invariant harges aording to (10). Thus, we (cid:28)nd the same behaviour for a moving

loop with urrent and for the same loop but at rest in a given IFR.

In the traditional (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) approah with the synhronous de(cid:28)nition of length and the

Lorentz ontration (see, e.g., [21℄) the harges on all sides are supposed to be zero in the rest

frame of a loop with urrent. In the IFR in whih the loop with urrent is moving it is found

that Q′
AB 6= QAB, due to the Lorentz ontration, and that the harge on the EF side is (cid:17)-(cid:17) of
that one on the AB side. Furthermore, it is obtained that the harges on the vertial sides of

a loop with urrent are zero for both the loop at rest and moving loop, sine for vertial sides

14

there is no Lorentz ontration. Suh results obtained in the ommon approah led the physis

ommunity (I am not aware of any exeption) to onlude that there is an eletri moment P for

a moving loop with urrent, (see [21℄, Eq.(18-58)). The appearane of this (cid:17)relativisti(cid:17) e(cid:27)et and

its onsequenes are disussed in numerous papers and books. Contrary to all these works we (cid:28)nd

in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) that at long distanes a loop with urrent always (in any IFR) behaves as a

quadrupole. The existene of a quadrupole eletri moment instead of dipole eletri moment will

in(cid:29)uene many previous results from the lassial eletrodynamis up to the intepretation of an

eletri moment for a moving neutron.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) is onsistently applied to the investigation of relatively moving

systems. We presented the expressions for the ovariantly de(cid:28)ned spaetime length (1) and for o-

variant 4D Lorentz transformations (2) when both are written in geometrial terms, and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

and (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatizations. It is also shown that it is not the spatial length but the spaetime length

(1) whih is well de(cid:28)ned quantity from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint; in the rest frame of the ob jet

and when the temporal part of la

AB is zero the spaetime length l beomes the rest spatial length of

the ob jet. Using this result and the ovariant de(cid:28)nition of harge (10) the expressions (12) for the

urrent density 4-vetors of a CCC were found in the ions' rest frame. Then the 4-vetors Eα
Bα
whih onnet the F αb

for a CCC are determined by means of the known F αβ

and Eα, Bα

formulations of eletrodynamis. This yields Eq. (22), whih

(15) and the relations (20) and (21),

and

is one of the main results found in this paper. It shows that for the obsevers at rest in the ions'

rest frame the spatial omponents Ei

of Eα

are di(cid:27)erent from zero outside a CCC. The seond

important result, whih is also found in a ompletely ovariant manner, i.e., in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

treatment, is the existene of invariant harges on a loop with urrent. There are opposite harges

on opposite sides of a square loop with urrent, but the total harge of that loop is zero. These

results are di(cid:27)erent from those found in all previous works in whih mainly the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) is

used.

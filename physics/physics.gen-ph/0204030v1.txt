Abstract

Heretofore unrecognized (i.e., “hidden”) Lorentz-invariant vector observables in the
fermion sector (i.e., ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion “coordinates”) are shown to indirectly ex-
plain most, if not all, of the so-called “accidental” (internal) symmetries associated with
fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons), by explaining quark and lepton ﬂavors,
ﬂavor doublets and families. Moreover, these new fermion coordinates lead to quanti-
tative constraints on neutrino mixtures that are found to be in good agreement with
current experimental observations. The new fermion coordinates arise in the context of
a quantized, internal 2-space possessing a non-Euclidean metric. “Quantization” here
means that all scalars, vectors and matrices relevant to a description of fundamental
fermions in the 2-space, are both discrete and ﬁnite in number. In a certain limited
sense, the new 2-space description of fundamental fermions is more fundamental, and
more general, than that provided by the standard model of particle physics. In partic-
ular, it points to a “layer” of new physics—located somewhere between the uniﬁcation
scale, and the region of applicability of the standard model—that is responsible for the
2-space, its quantization, and its associated “selection rules.”

1.0 Introduction

Most physicists would probably agree that the standard model of particle physics [1–3], based
U(1)Y , is only a low-energy or “macroscopic” ap-
on the gauge group SU(3)color ×
proximation to a deeper, more fundamental, uniﬁed theory, possibly involving either Planck
level physics at an energy scale of 1019GeV [4, 5], or a much lower TeV energy scale should
the anticipated extra dimensions turn out to be large [6]. Consider for example, the case of
the standard-model Lagrangian.

SU(2)L ×

Given the number of ﬂavors of quarks and leptons, and an appropriate (renormalizable)
strong-electroweak Lagrangian, the so-called “accidental symmetries” of the Lagrangian [7]
are known to “explain” both the existence, and separate (exact or approximate) conservation,
of various (global) “charges” associated with quarks and leptons (e.g., lepton number, baryon
number, strangeness, charm, truth, beauty, electron-, muon- and tau-numbers). However,
there is nothing in such Lagrangians, or their associated accidental symmetries, that would
explain quarks and leptons, or tell us how many ﬂavors of quarks and leptons to include in
the Lagrangian. Rather, it seems that the Lagrangian is not an explanation for these things,
but instead is a result of physics at some deeper, more fundamental, level, possibly involving
uniﬁcation. However, if uniﬁcation really does occur, we are immediately faced with the

1

important unanswered question of exactly how the standard model of particle physics, and its
associated Lagrangian, arises or emerges from this deeper, more fundamental, “substratum.”
In this paper these questions are addressed in a new way by identifying what may turn
out to be an intermediate “layer” of new physics located somewhere between the uniﬁcation
scale (wherever it happens to be), and the region of applicability of the standard model of
particle physics. The strategy pursued here is similar to that of S. Goudsmit and G. Ulenbeck
[8], who ﬁrst realized that a description of the observed ﬁne structure in atomic spectra was
not possible unless electrons possessed, in addition to their mass and electric charge, a
previously hidden spin “coordinate.” In particular, the principal purpose of this paper is
to argue that the proposed intermediate “layer” of new physics is described by heretofore
unrecognized (i.e., “hidden”) 2-vector observables in the fermion sector (i.e., ﬂavor-deﬁning
fermion “coordinates” U, V and Q), which serve to explain, among many other things,
the proliferation of matter ﬁelds (ﬂavors) in comparison to the relative paucity of force-
mediating particles. And, because we will also argue here that the new ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion
coordinates (i.e., the 2-vectors Q, U, V where Q = U + V) are Lorentz-invariant, we will
be free to perform a variety of physically meaningful algebraic, geometric, and topological
manipulations on any one (or more) of these coordinates—without undue concern for how
these manipulations “appear” to observers located in arbitrary (inertial ) coordinate systems.
From the foregoing, it is clear that once new coordinates of this kind are introduced in
the fermion sector, an entirely new description of fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons)
must result. Moreover, the proposed description appears to be both more fundamental, and
more general (in certain limited respects), than the standard model description of funda-
mental fermions. For example, by employing these new fermion coordinates, the question
of why fundamental fermion families are replicated, and the question of why there are just
three families, can both be answered, whereas this is not possible in the standard model de-
scription [1–3]. Thus the new ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates serve both to complement,
and to (modestly) extend, the standard model of particle physics.

This work is based, in part, on previous works by the author wherein diﬀerent aspects of
this approach to ﬂavors, families, and the problem of family replication, were discussed [9–
13]. These works provide a diﬀerent emphasis, and in some cases, a more detailed description
of many features of this general idea that are only touched upon in the present work, which
essentially reviews, clariﬁes, and consolidates these earlier works.

2.0 The Electric Charge Coordinates Q

It is well known that in quantum mechanics the wave function or state vector Ψn describ-
ing an individual (“isolated”) particle, provides all of the information that is available, in
principle, about that particle. Here, the subscript on Ψn refers to various kinds of simul-
taneously observable quantum numbers associated with the particle. Hence, it is possible
to eﬀectively deﬁne such a quantum state by specifying the speciﬁc values of these simul-
taneous observables [14]. In a similar way, there are known to exist certain simultaneously
observable ﬂavor-deﬁning quantum numbers (e.g., strangeness and baryon number) that

2

serve to deﬁne individual ﬂavor or antiﬂavor eigenstates of quarks and leptons [15, 16]. It is
proposed here that these ﬂavor-deﬁning quantum numbers are to be identiﬁed with certain
global charge-conjugation-reversing (C-reversing) scalars, which are derived, in turn, from
the ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates, Q, U and V.

If ever there was a signal for new coordinates in particle physics, surely it comes from
the known fundamental-fermion sector. Unlike the known “force-mediating” fundamental-
boson sector (i.e., the photon, gluons, the graviton, and weak intermediate vector bosons),
matter-particles or fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons), exhibit a relative plethora
of ﬂavors falling into three families. Counting only color-ﬂavor states, there are 48 known
fundamental fermions and antifermions [17], compared with only 13 force-mediating bosons
[18]. What could be more natural than to assume that this “embarrassment of riches” in
the fermion sector, is due to new ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates, which are not carried
by the force-mediating bosons [18, 19]?

In a recent paper [10], it was shown that the fermion-number operator F(op) itself may be
the key to a preliminary understanding of how new ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates such
as the electric-charge coordinate Q arise. In particular, let us review the salient points in
[10] to see how these coordinates arise from an analytic continuation of the fermion-number
operator F(op).

2.1 Analytic continuation of F(op) and a new internal non-Euclid-

ean 2-space

We have found that an analytic-continuation of a Hermitian matrix F(op) representing the
conventional fermion-number operator, from an external spacetime and Hilbert-space setting,
to a new internal (real) non-Euclidean space—F(op) is continued to a real, generally non-
diagonal matrix F(v) involving a single real parameter v—“automatically” leads to a new
description of fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) in which families are replicated and
there are just three families. The fact that this happens, suggests that there is some deep
connection between the result of the aforementioned analytic-continuation, namely F(v),
and some more fundamental underlying physics (e.g., Planck-level physics) where ﬂavor
degrees-of-freedom, and family-replication, presumably originate.

2.1.1 The fermion-number operator F(op)

Consider the situation, presumably at some high energy, where we are dealing with “free”
(isolated) leptons or “analytically free” quarks. Suppose we want to describe the scalar
fermion-number carried by these particles. And, suppose further, that the energies involved
are not so high that quantum ﬁeld-theory (QFT) breaks down. Under these conditions the
fermion-number can be represented by a U(1)-type scalar “charge” [20, 21], namely, a charge
associated with the (continuous) group of unitary matrices U of order 1 known as U(1).

The fermion-number operator, which can be represented by a Hermitian matrix F(op),
is said to generate these so-called “gauge” (or phase) transformations, which in turn act on

as can be veriﬁed by diﬀerentiating UHU † with respect to α. Hence, the total fermion-

motion.

signiﬁcance and v

In Ref. 9, pp. 50 and 54 it is argued that only the upper signs in (10) have physical
0. And, just what is the physical signiﬁcance of F(v)?
Because the continuation “connects” F(op) and F(v), it is natural to assume that both
F(op) and F(v) describe, or represent, aspects of the fermion number (i.e., the matter-
antimatter “degree-of-freedom” or matter-antimatter “dichotomy”). However, unlike F(op)
or f , F(v) is a kind of “generalized fermion-number,” which will be shown to describe
additional degrees-of-freedom such as the “up”-“down” and quark-lepton degrees-of-freedom.
Moreover, it is abundantly clear from (10) that the generally non-Hermitian (when v
= 0)
matrix F(v)—unlike the Hermitian matrix F(op) in (8), which acts on Hilbert space—does
not act on a Hilbert space in an external spacetime setting [22].

2.1.4 A new internal non-Euclidean 2-space

Because of the matter-antimatter dichotomy exhibited by fundamental fermions, the fermion-
number operator F(op) is necessarily a 2 by 2 matrix, and so the continuation of F(op),
namely F(v), is also a 2 by 2 matrix. Therefore, the matrix F(v) must “act” on some new
internal 2-dimensional space. What is the nature of this space? In particular, assuming that
it is a metric space, what is the metric?

2.2 Quantization of the imaginary angle θ and the electric-charge

coordinates Q

It is very important to understand that the imaginary angle θ in (9) must be quantized. That
is, when we do the continuation to an imaginary angle, the only allowed values seem to be

or

θ = iv = i ln Mc,

e−iθ = Mc,

where Mc = 1 or 3 only (see Refs. 24, 25, and Ref 9, p. 79).

This quantization of θ and/or v comes about in the following way. Because the eigen-
values of F(v) are C-reversing quantized charges, the components of both the diagonal and
oﬀ-diagonal forms of the matrix F(v) are, necessarily, quantized charges. Since the compo-
nents of F(v) involve hyperbolic functions of v, it follows that ev, e−v and v are, necessarily
quantized. In particular, as we show elsewhere f e−v = f /Mc is a quantized charge identiﬁed
with the baryon or lepton number (Ref. 9, pp. 52, 53), depending on the value of the quan-
tum number Mc. And, from the spin-statistics theorem, we know that an odd number of
fundamental fermions must bind together (“strongly”) to form a baryon or lepton. Hence,
the quantum number Mc must be an odd integer Mc = 1, 3, 5, . . . . (see Refs. 24, 25, and
Ref. 9, p. 79).

These identiﬁcations are remarkable for at least two reasons. First, we discover that
the eigenvectors of F(v), and related functions evaluated at Mc = 1 and Mc = 3, yield the
quantized electric charges of both leptons and quarks, and their associated quantized lepton
or baryon numbers, respectively [26]. In particular, choose the upper signs in (10),

Then identify (see Ref. 9, pp. 52–55) the quark and lepton electric charges with the “up”-

Second, it is abundantly clear that the quantum number Mc can be identiﬁed with the
strong-color “multiplicity.” In particular, leptons being strong-color singlets (Mc = 1) do
not bind strongly to form a composite particle, whereas quarks being strong-color triplets
(Mc = 3), do bind strongly to form a composite baryon. That is, Mc is both a measure of
the strong-color multiplicity and the number of quarks or leptons that bind (strongly) to
form composite particles.

}

It is remarkable that the 2-space description of fundamental fermions has “automatically’
yielded, not only the electric, baric and leptic charges of quarks and leptons, but also an
unanticipated connection with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and SU(3)color. In partic-
ular, the 2-space and the associated quantized parameter v = ln Mc, implies that something
very similar to SU(3)color must be a symmetry of nature. We take this circumstance to be
a strong indication that the 2-space and/or whatever underlying physics is responsible for it,
is more primitive (i.e., more fundamental ) than the standard model of particle physics.

As demonstrated in Section 2.2.1, the charge-like scalar components of 2-vector coordinates
such as Qq or Ql change signs under X. However, owing to the 2-space metric given by (11),
scalar products of 2-vectors whose components transform like charges, will also be charge

a later section that when charge vectors such as Q (or Qc) are resolved in the 2-space into
pairs of linearly independent vectors (e.g., Q = U + V), not only are the components of Q,

3.0 What Dynamics Governs the Evolution of Flavor-
Deﬁning Fermion Coordinates Q, U and V?

As a ﬁrst approximation, it is safe to say that the dynamics of a system consisting of an
“isolated” or individual elementary particle, is governed by the evolution of the system wave
function or state vector. The state vector in turn evolves according to quantum mechan-
ical equations of motion that can be said to arise from an appropriate strong-electroweak
Lagrangian (when the standard model applies) or a more fundamental Lagrangian in case
deeper physics applies [29]. The question that naturally arises in the present situation is how
such a dynamical description is altered or constrained, if at all, by the new ﬂavor-deﬁning
fermion coordinates Q, U and V? Even a partial answer to this question may suggest ways
that the new 2-space description of fundamental fermions can be experimentally tested. Let
us begin the discussion by describing how quantum mechanical state vectors can be partially
represented using the new 2-vector fermion coordinates Q, U and V.

3.1 Representing ﬂavor eigenstates and ﬂavor doublets in the 2-

space

The continuation from the 2-D Hilbert space to the 2-D non-Euclidean “charge” space (see
Sec. 2.1.3) turns out to mean that individual ﬂavors of fundamental fermions can be partially
represented in an unconventional way by geometric objects (in the non-Euclidean 2-space)
which diﬀer from a quantum state, but from which the quantum states can be inferred
or eﬀectively constructed. In particular, in the non-Euclidean 2-space, an object we call a
“vector triad” (i.e., the “triad” of ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates Q, U and V) represents
“up”-“ down” type ﬂavor doublets of fundamental fermions and antifermions—the “up”-
“down” type ﬂavor dichotomy. That is, the components of the vectors associated with a
given vector-triad are observable Lorentz-invariant (Lorentz 4-scalar) “charges,” which can
be used to deﬁne the two ﬂavor-eigenstates in a ﬂavor doublet [15, 27, 28, 16, 30].

3.1.1 Flavor eigenstates

As demonstrated in detail in Ref. 9, pp. 16–18, given the charge-like (C-reversing) observ-
ables associated with the description involving F(v), namely, the real C-reversing scalar-

11

components of various matrices and vectors deﬁned on the internal non-Euclidean 2-space,
it is possible to write down ﬂavor eigenstates [16, 30].

In principle, what one does is to identify the mutually-commuting C-reversing “charges”
(call them Ci) or charge-like quantum numbers associated with a particular ﬂavor, and then
write the corresponding simultaneous ﬂavor-eigenstate as

.

|

(42)

C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cni
Here C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cn, are the “good” charge-like ﬂavor-deﬁning quantum numbers (charges)
associated with a particular ﬂavor. It happens that these observable real-numbers can be
identiﬁed with quantum numbers such as electric charge, strangeness, charm, the third-
component of (global) isospin, truth and beauty (see Ref. 9, p. 72). To discover what charges
describe a particular ﬂavor we must ﬁrst identify the vector-triad associated with that ﬂavor.
Now, each vector-triad represents a ﬂavor doublet, not just an individual ﬂavor. That is,
vector-triads provide information on two quantum states (two simultaneous ﬂavor-eigenstates)
associated with ﬂavor doublets. Therefore, vector-triads are associated with both individual
ﬂavors and ﬂavor doublets. Here we simply summarize how it is the that non-Euclidean
vector-triads can be associated with both individual ﬂavors and “up”-“down” type ﬂavor-
doublets.

3.1.2 Flavor doublets

Consider the eigenvector (call it Q) of F(v) for fundamental fermions (see Footnote 26, and
Sec. 2.2). Since the space on which F(v) “acts” is two-dimensional, the observable vector
Q can be “resolved” into two (no more or less) observable, linearly-independent vectors, call
them U and V, as Q = U + V [31, 32]. Now, because these three vectors (Q, U, and V)
are simultaneous observables, it makes sense to speak of this “triad” of vectors as being a
well deﬁned geometric object, namely, a “vector triad.”

Recognizing that the components of Q, U and V are C-reversing charge-like observables

we can write these observable “charge” vectors as

{
{
{
where q1, q2, u1, u2, v1 and v2 are the various observable “charges” (e.g., q1 and q2 were
found to be electric charges). Given Q = U + V, the non-Euclidean metric (11), and Eqs.
(43) through (45), we ﬁnd the associated observable quadratic “charges”

Finally, using the foregoing ﬂavor-deﬁning charges, we can express the two quantum states
(simultaneous ﬂavor-eigenstates) associated with a single vector-triad in the form of “ket”
vectors as follows (see Ref. 14, and Ref. 9, pp. 16–18)

In this section we have demonstrated, among other things, that there are essentially two
ways the new ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates (Q, U, V) can be combined. In particular,
when (Q, U, V) apply to the same fundamental fermion, these vectors can either be added,
as in Q = U + V, or they can be multiplied, as in the non-Euclidean scalar products (i.e.,
“projections”) expressed by Equations 46–49. However, as described in the next section, the
linear superposition principle of quantum mechanics severely limits the ways (Q, U, V) can
be combined when two or more fundamental fermion ﬂavors are involved.

3.2 When the new internal coordinates cannot be superimposed

According to the linear superposition principle of quantum mechanics (QM), wave functions
or state vectors for two or more particles, and certain of their associated simultaneously
observable charge-like quantum numbers or “charges,” can be superimposed. And, because
the overarching linear superposition principle of QM must be retained, it turns out that like
ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates associated with (“carried by”) two or more fundamental
fermions cannot be superimposed or added (Q with Q, U with U and V with V). For, if
they could be superimposed, the linear superposition principle of QM could not be retained,
nor could ﬂavors be deﬁned in a self-consistent way using the fermion coordinates (Q, U, V).
In particular, one obvious reason that like coordinates (Q, U or V) for two or more
fundamental fermions cannot be superimposed, is that such superpositions inevitably lead
to nonsensical charge-like quantum numbers (“charges”), which could not be “carried” by a
sensible state vector, or used to deﬁne the corresponding wave function or state vector for
the collection of particles in question. Let us demonstrate the validity of this assertion by
giving a few simple examples, which serve to demonstrate some of the rules governing the
superposition (or lack thereof) of the 2-vector coordinates Q, U and V.

3.2.1 Rules for combining Q, U and V

Consider the case of three quarks bound together by strong forces to form a baryon with
baryon number B = 1. Since the baryon number of each quark is given by Q2 = 1/3, the
baryon number for three bound quarks is simply 3Q2 = B = 1. Now this result makes it
clear that we cannot simply add the three vectors Q together ﬁrst, and then “square” them
to get the baryon number for such a composite particle. In particular, it is clear that the
baryon number of a composite consisting of three quarks is not given by (3Q)2 = B = 3.

13

}

1, 0

= +2√3/3 and (3Q/√3)
{

Now it might be supposed that this algorithmic failure can be attributed to the absence
of an appropriate “normalization” factor when adding such vectors. For example, suppose
that we were to make the rule that when N of these Q-vectors are added, we must divide the
vector sum by √N . Then for the case of three quarks we would have a baryon number given
by (3Q/√3)2 = B = 1, which is certainly correct. However, the maximum, and minimum,
electric charges of such a composite would then be given, respectively, by the scalar products
(3Q/√3)
1/3). Clearly,

this is incorrect since three quarks with electric charges +2/3 obviously form a composite
baryon with an electric charge of +2 not +2√3/3. Similarly, three quarks with electric

Considerations of the foregoing kind lead to the conclusion that like vector coordinates
for two or more fundamental fermions cannot be added or superimposed (Q with Q, U with
U, V with V), the way quantum states or state vectors can be superimposed. Only the
ﬂavor-deﬁning scalar charges associated with the ﬂavor-deﬁning coordinates Q, U and V
for two or more fundamental fermions, can be combined or superimposed. That is, because
ﬂavor eigenstates are to be described in terms of various simultaneously-observable, global,
ﬂavor-deﬁning (scalar) charge-like quantum numbers (associated with Q, U or V), it is
simply not physically meaningful to superimpose like coordinates Q, U or V for two or
more particles [8].

The foregoing discussion clearly demonstrates that the dynamical signiﬁcance of the new
ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates Q, U and V is quite diﬀerent than say, the intrinsic
angular momentum or spin coordinates for two diﬀerent fermions. Angular momentum
vectors for two diﬀerent particles can be combined, but the corresponding (like) Q-, U-, and
V-vector coordinates cannot. Nevertheless, the triad of 2-vector coordinates (Q, U and V)
used to represent a ﬂavor eigenstate, is expected to change or evolve during certain kinds of
transitions or interactions, simply because the wave function or state vector, which depends,
in part, on ﬂavor-deﬁning global scalars associated with Q, U and V, necessarily, evolves.

Clearly, the expectation that the vector triad evolves could have experimental conse-
quences. As we will demonstrate in a later section, the evolution of vector triads, as con-
strained by new underlying physics, could lead to an explanation for, among other things,
recent observations of solar neutrino mixing.

3.3 Quantization of the coordinates U and V

Because the fermion-number operator F(op) is a 2 by 2 matrix, its continuation (see Sec.
2.1.3), namely F(v), must likewise be a 2 by 2 matrix. Thus we have a natural explanation
for why there must be two new linearly-independent ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates U
and V associated with quarks and leptons, and their hypothetical superpartners [19]. Note
that we have just two new (2-vector) coordinates U and V because the resultant 2-space
can maintain at most two linearly independent 2-vector resolutions of Q at a time [31]. The
question now arises as to how it is that these fermion coordinates can be quantized.

Since we do not have a ﬁrst-principles understanding of the proposed quantization in
terms of underlying dynamics, we will appeal to simple heuristic arguments that serve not
only to place the question in perspective, but also yield deﬁnite rules for quantizing these
coordinates.

the origin for purposes of illustration. It is assumed to pass through the origin.

Write the 2-vectors U and V in terms of component charges, which we would like to quantize

so as to quantize the coordinates U and V. That is, write them as row (

{
respectively. Now argue that it should take only one charge type (i.e., u or v) to distinguish
“up” and “down” type ﬂavors within any and all “up”-“down” type ﬂavor doublets. If this
is so, we can assume, without loss of generality, that this is the charge u (i.e., u1 or u2).
Then, since the charge v does not distinguish “up” and “down” type ﬂavors, it must be true
that v1 = v2 for every ﬂavor doublet of fundamental fermions. And, therefore, given the
metric in (11), the quantized charge V2 has but one value, namely, V2 = (v1, v2)
=
(v2
v2
2) = 0 for all fundamental fermions. That is, all fundamental fermions are “neutral,”
i.e., they are singlets with respect to the global charge V2.

Then, since Q = U + V, we can write Q in column vector form in terms of U and V

electric charges for all fundamental fermions deﬁnes the fundamental (quantum) unit of

Now consider the nature of the charges u (i.e., u1 and/or u2), which are the components
. Because the charge u distinguishes “up” ﬂavors from “down” ﬂavors,
of U =
and because it is a charge, it must be possible for this charge, like all known charges, to
assume the value zero. Then, given that u-charge can be zero in certain cases, and given the
, we see immediately that the quantized values of a must include the
form U =
values a = 0 or 1. This means that there are at least four U-vectors, namely, the vectors
U =

3.3.2 Family replication and the number of families

Clearly, if we limit the discussion to matter particles—the same arguments apply to anti-
matter particles and the vectors Qc
l —we note that because the vector Qq applies
to quarks and Ql applies to leptons, some of the U- and V-vectors (and associated global
charges) will apply to quarks, but not to leptons, and vice versa. So, it is appropriate to
ask which of the six possible U-vectors go with the vector Qq, and which of the six possible
U-vectors go with the vector Ql. Once this question is answered, one can easily determine
In
which V-vectors go with the vector Qq, and which V-vectors go with the vector Ql.

q and Qc

16

other words, we will be able to determine which U-vectors go with which V-vectors to form
a vector triad (Q, U, V) that serves to describe ﬂavor doublets of quarks or leptons. This
information will tell us, in turn, how many generations of quarks and leptons there are, and
hence how many families of fundamental fermions there are.

By inspection of Figure 2 we see that the requisite form for V-vectors, namely, V =

}
cannot be maintained if U-vectors in quadrant II (IV ) are associated with the vector Qq (Ql)
in quadrant IV (II ). Therefore, we discover that the single vector Qq (Ql) in quadrant IV
(II), can only be associated with the three U-vectors located in the same quadrant. This
simple result immediately tells us that, because there are only six U-vectors to choose from—
three of which fall in quadrant IV, and three of which fall in quadrant II—there are only
three generations of quark ﬂavor doublets and three generations of lepton ﬂavor doublets.

{

This is a remarkable result, for it means that a most unexpected explanation for why
there are three families “automatically” emerges from the 2-space description. Of course, the
underlying dynamics responsible for the 2-space, its quantization, and its associated selection
rules would, if available, presumably provide a much more detailed explanation [29].

3.3.3 Quantization of the V-vector

Given the four Q-vectors (see Fig. 1), the six U-vectors from Section 3.3.1 and Figure 2, the
associations between vectors such as Qq, Ql and the six U-vectors (see Sec. 3.3.2), and the
relation Q = U+V, we have the following sequence of eleven quantized V-vectors, consistent

3.3.4 A natural basis for family membership of ﬂavor doublets

The discussion in Section 3.3.2 makes it clear that there are only three quark-lepton families.
But, what determines which quark ﬂavor doublet goes with which lepton ﬂavor doublet to
make a particular quark-lepton family? In other words, how does one decide which quark
U-vector goes with which lepton U-vector?

The question of family membership of ﬂavor doublets is not answered in the standard
model of particle physics where these family assignments are made, more-or-less, on the
basis of the mass hierarchy of the average family member. However, in the 2-space, there are

17

other, more “natural,” ways of assigning ﬂavor doublets to families (see Ref. 9 for a detailed
discussion). We note ﬁrst the fact that two of the three quark ﬂavor doublets associated

It turns out (see Ref. 9, pp. 56–58) that the vector triads (Q, U, V) associated with both
quarks and leptons have the highest possible degree of symmetry with respect to the matrix
transformation F(v), only when the associated U-vectors are
. And, because
the “ground state” is typically the most probable state, with the highest degree of symmetry
into which other less symmetrical states tend to evolve [36], it is natural to assume that the
are associated with the ﬁrst or “ground state” family. Recall that
U-vectors
the members of the ﬁrst family have the lowest average mass of any family members, and so
the ﬁrst family naturally resembles a kind of “ground state.”

The foregoing associations and identiﬁcations, together with the speciﬁc family assign-
ments of the experimentally observed quarks and leptons, are elaborated elsewhere (see Ref.
9). However, it should be clear—as we have repeatedly emphasized throughout this paper—
that the foregoing heuristic 2-space relations and associations must be a consequence of
some “deeper,” more fundamental, “layer” of physics that is responsible for the 2-space, its
quantization, and its associated selection rules.

3.4 The nature of transitions of vector triads

Because strong and electromagnetic interactions have no eﬀect on ﬂavor indices, they can
have no eﬀect on the ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates. Hence, vector triads (Q, U, V) will
be unaﬀected by strong and electromagnetic interactions. However, in general, this is not
the case for weak interactions.

Because the quantum state of an “isolated” fundamental fermion such as a quark (even-
tually) evolves via weak interactions, so must the associated vector triad, consisting of the
three 2-vectors (Q, U and V) evolve, and vice versa. And, if we knew the dynamics [29]
underlying the 2-space, presumably we would be in a position to calculate, from ﬁrst prin-
ciples, such things as Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements. However, as
this dynamics is currently unknown, we will have to satisfy ourselves here with a less ambi-
tious description based on mathematical properties of the 2-space, and certain experimental
facts about transitions of fundamental fermions. Consider ﬁrst the so-called “diagonal” weak
transitions of quarks.

Diagonal weak transitions of quarks are “up”-“down” or “down”-“up” type transitions
involving the two quark ﬂavors (ﬂavor eigenstates) “located” within the same ﬂavor doublet.
From experimental data on CKM matrix elements, these diagonal transitions are known
to be far more probable than the so-called “oﬀ-diagonal” transitions, which are relatively
suppressed. What do these experimental facts teach us about the evolution of vector triads?
In the case of diagonal transitions, it is clear that the vector triad associated with the
initial quark state, and the vector triad associated with the ﬁnal quark state, are identical,
i.e., they are congruent. By comparison, the initial and ﬁnal state triads associated with
all “oﬀ-diagonal” weak transitions of quarks are diﬀerent. These observations suggest that

19

the underlying dynamics tends to “prefer” transitions in which the associated vector triad
is unchanged. Clearly, such transitions would be characterized by the “selection rules” (use
Q = U + V)

(56)

(57)

V, are

Moreover, since Q, U and V don’t change in such transitions, we also have the selection
rules

∆Q = ∆U = ∆V = 0.

∆Q2 = ∆U2 = ∆U

V = 0,

•

which means that the baryon number B = Q2, the charge U2, and the charge U
separately maintained or conserved in such transitions [37].

•

While quark masses play a signiﬁcant role in determining the magnitudes of CKM matrix
elements, there appears to be a trend here, namely, this: “Easy” transitions (i.e., diagonal
transitions within a quark generation) are those for which the associated vector triad does
not change, and “hard” transitions (i.e., oﬀ-diagonal transitions between diﬀerent quark
generations) are those for which it does change.

To be more speciﬁc, while there are some 24 ﬂavor and antiﬂavor eigenstates of quarks and
leptons [17], there are just 12 distinct vector triads. That is, the vector triad associated with
each ﬂavor doublet is associated with each of two ﬂavor or antiﬂavor eigenstates. This means
that all diagonal transitions involve the same vector triad, and all oﬀ-diagonal transitions
involve diﬀerent (distinguishable) vector triads.

What is it that diﬀers from vector triad to vector triad? Of course, charge-like quantum

numbers such as

Q2, U2, and U

can sometimes diﬀer. But there are other, more subtle, things that can diﬀer as well. It
happens that diﬀerent vector triads, and certain of their associated 2-vector coordinates, are
“isolated” from one another in a topological sense. Take for example the four 2-vectors Qq,
Qc

q, Ql, and Qc
Because there are no continuous transformations (associated with the metric in Eq. 11)
available to convert the 2-vectors Qq, Qc
q, Ql and Qc
l one into the other, these four Q-vectors
are, necessarily, topologically distinct. It is certainly conceivable that this fact could be an
important underlying reason for the separate conservation of baryon number B and lepton
number L in most physical processes. In particular, because the Q-vectors are topologically
distinct, underlying dynamics could conceivably dictate that there are topological energy
“barriers” that maintain these topological distinctions, leading to the 2-vector selection rule
[39]

and consequently to the selection rule (Note that Q2 = B or L)

which should then apply to all fundamental fermions [39].

Of course, the discussion in the previous paragraph involves only one of the three 2-vector
coordinates (i.e., Q) associated with a vector triad (Q, U, V). There are other topological
distinctions that can be drawn, which involve all three 2-vectors associated with a particular
vector triad. For example, as shown elsewhere (see Ref. 9, pp. 56, 57, and Appendix A in Ref.
13), and as elaborated in the following section, there are also topological distinctions based on
how an entire vector triad (Q, U, V) transforms under the matrix F(v). It happens that some
vector triads transform like M¨obius strips, and some transform like cylinders under F(v).
Clearly, if there were underlying topological energy “barriers” that act to inhibit changes
in the topology of entire vector triads, this situation could have experimental consequences
[38]. And, if experiments were to eventually conﬁrm that such topological energy “barriers”
exist, a new level of dynamics “below” or “beyond” the standard model of particle physics
would seem to be required to explain them.

3.5 Does the dynamics underlying the 2-space impose topological

constraints on 3-ﬂavor neutrino mixtures?

As alluded to in the previous section, it is important to understand that the new 2-space de-
scription of fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) provides a distinction between these
particles that goes beyond diﬀerences that can be explained by mass diﬀerences alone. For
example, in the standard model of particle physics the only diﬀerence between the u, c and
t quarks is that they have diﬀerent masses. Otherwise, these particles experience identical
strong and electroweak interactions. Moreover, the separate conservation (in strong and
electromagnetic interactions) of quantum numbers such as “charm” and “truth” can be at-
tributed to certain unavoidable “accidental symmetries” associated with the (renormalizable)
Lagrangian describing the interactions of these particles [7].

Taken at face value, these accidental symmetries would seem to imply that there are no
internal “wheels and gears” that would distinguish a u quark from a c quark, for example.
But, if the string theories are correct, these particles would be associated with diﬀerent
“handles” on the compactiﬁed space (see Ref. 4, Vol. 2, p. 408), and so would be diﬀerent in
this additional sense. Likewise, in the present non-Euclidean 2-space description, topological
diﬀerences in addition to a variety of (global) 2-scalars, which are indirectly related to the
accidental symmetries of the Lagrangian, serve to provide further distinctions between matter
particles.

A possible experimental signal of such internal diﬀerences is to be found in the recent
ντ neutrino
observations at the Super Kamiokande and SNO of (nearly) bi-maximal νµ −
mixing [43]. Models which begin by positing a neutrino mass-matrix, and associated mixing-
parameters, such as the three-generation model proposed by Georgi and Glashow [40], do
ντ
an acceptable job of describing the observations. However, (nearly) bi-maximal νµ −
mixing may have a deeper explanation in terms of internal topological diﬀerences (in the
non-Euclidean 2-space) between νe, and νµ or ντ neutrinos.

With respect to the internal transformation F(v), the topology of the non-Euclidean

21

“vector triad” (see Ref. 9, p. 57, and the qualifying remarks in Appendix A of Ref. 13)
associated with the νe (νµ or ντ ), is found to be that of a cylinder (M¨obius strip). And,
assuming that a change in topology (of vector triads) during neutrino mixing is suppressed by
energy “barriers,” or other topological “barriers” described by physics “beyond” the standard
model, while neutrino mixing without topology-change is (relatively) enhanced [38, 41, 42],
ντ neutrino
one can readily explain the experimental observation of (nearly) bi-maximal νµ −
ντ mixing over long distances, where the proposed
mixing—at least (nearly) bi-maximal νµ −
topological inﬂuences are expected to be cumulative.
If this qualitative explanation (see
detailed calculations below) is basically correct, then it follows that the neutrino mass-
ντ
matrix, and associated mixing-parameters needed to explain (nearly) bi-maximal νµ −
neutrino mixing, would be the result of new physics (i.e., dynamics) associated with these
deeper (internal) topological diﬀerences between neutrinos, and not their cause.

3.5.1 Conventional description of 3-ﬂavor neutrino mixing

Except where explicitly prevented by some “absolute” conservation law (e.g., the conserva-
tion of electric charge or spin angular momentum), quantum mechanics generally permits
transitions between states having diﬀerent topologies [41]. While a change in topology may
be energetically (or otherwise) inhibited by underlying dynamics, unavoidable quantum ﬂuc-
tuations are expected to catalyze such processes. Hence, there is always the possibility of
mixing between otherwise similar quantum states (e.g., νe, νµ and ντ ) associated with vector
triads having distinct topologies [42].

As described previously—with respect to the matrix transformation F(v)—the topology
associated with both the νµ and ντ is found to be that of a M¨obius strip (Ref. 47, p.
143). By contrast, the topology associated with the νe [with respect to F(v)] is that of a
cylinder. And because it is reasonable to assume that a change in topology during transitions
tends to be suppressed [38], the foregoing topological distinctions between neutrinos may
help explain recent observations of (nearly) bi-maximal νµ-ντ mixing [43]. However, it is
important to stress at the outset that there are good reasons for believing that similar
topological distinctions (alone) among quarks, while also present, do not play an important
role in d, s, b quark mixing [44].

At “birth” via weak decays, or upon detection via weak capture interactions, neutrinos
have a deﬁnite ﬂavor and associated topology [45]. However, between birth and detection
they are in a mixed state having no deﬁnite ﬂavor or associated topology. In this intermediate
region the probability of ﬂavor (or topology) maintenance and/or change oscillates. Only at
great distances from the neutrino source do these oscillations ﬁnally “damp out.”

In the conventional description of three-ﬂavor neutrino mixing ﬂavor eigenstates are re-
lated to neutrino mass eigenstates (states of deﬁnite mass) via a unitary CKM-like “mixing”
matrix Uαi, as follows (Ref. 3, p. 365 and Ref. 46)

3.5.2 Proposed topological constraints on 3-ﬂavor neutrino mixing

Given that the νe (νµ or ντ ) neutrino ﬂavor has the associated topology of a cylinder (M¨obius
strip) with respect to the internal transformation F(v), and assuming that topological con-
straints are the primary determinants of the matrix M describing long-distance neutrino
mixtures, the matrix M is easily determined. To accomplish this we need only apply the
following very general principle to neutrino-neutrino transitions:

All other things being equal, any neutrino ﬂavor να (i.e., νe, νµ or ντ ), which under-
goes neutrino-neutrino transitions that change the associated neutrino topology, will tend
to be suppressed, while neutrino-neutrino transitions that maintain the associated neutrino
topology will tend to be (relatively) enhanced [38].

To this principle we add the following corollary,

All other things being equal, because the νµ and ντ neutrinos have the same associated
topology, they will act the same way in all neutrino-neutrino transitions (involving long-
distance neutrino mixtures).

Given these principles, and assuming as stated previously that topological constraints are
the primary determinants of the matrix M, we immediately have the following topological
constraints on long-distance neutrino mixtures:

A. No matter what neutrino ﬂavor (να) and associated topology one starts with at some
distant source (say the sun or a supernova), by the time the neutrino mixture reaches its
“equilibrium” state (where all time-dependent oscillations have “damped out”), it should
contain equal fractions of νµ and ντ , because these neutrinos have the same associated
topology.

B. Because the νµ and ντ neutrinos have the same associated topology, if one starts out
with either a pure νµ or a pure ντ source, one should end up with the same long-distance
equilibrium mixture of νe, νµ and ντ .

C. If topology is the controlling factor in describing long-distance neutrino mixtures,
then there should be absolutely no (eﬀective) diﬀerence between the two functions (of U-
, because the νµ and ντ
matrix mixing parameters), which describe

and

neutrinos are associated with the same topology. Very loosely speaking we are assuming
that these mathematical functions are eﬀectively “topological invariants” with respect to
the exchange of ﬂavor indices µ and τ (see Ref. 47, pp. 20 and 21). That is, not only are
required to be equal, but they are also required to

3.5.3 Determination of the matrix M

When the proposed topological constraints of Section 3.5.2 are applied to the conventional
description of neutrino mixing (62), the matrix M in (66), (67) and (69), is uniquely de-
termined. To see how this happens consider the following time-average probabilities (see
Appendix B in Ref. 13 for details)

namely, (s2

which result, in turn, in a unique quantitative determination of the matrix M (see Eq. 84).

3.5.4 Topology-maintaining and topology-changing inﬂuences in equilibrium?

Not only is the matrix M in (84) a unique solution to the proposed topological constraints
of Section 3.5.2 with sin2 δ
= 0, but it also has some very special properties
that may eventually help reveal the deeper dynamical signiﬁcance of this matrix. Note that
(66), (69), and (84) have the very special property

Now this equality looks very much like an “equilibrium” condition between those un-
derlying physical inﬂuences that would act to change the associated νe topology (quantum
ﬂuctuations), and those underlying physical inﬂuences that would act to maintain the asso-
ciated νe topology (e.g., topological energy “barriers”).

We will now provide further support for this proposal. In particular, consider the “joint”

probability [48]

Therefore, when PC = PN C, (91) and (92) tell us that the joint probability P = PC ·
is a maximum, namely, it characterizes some most probable condition or “state.” And,
this of course is the very essence of an “equilibrium” condition [12]. However, it must be
understood that this hypothetical (long-distance) “equilibrium” between topology-changing,
and topology-maintaining physical inﬂuences, is only a (cumulative) result of deeper, and
largely unknown (short-distance), dynamical processes in the vacuum, which ﬁrst begin to
act on neutrinos at their source—thereby, eventually establishing the equilibrium condition
PC = PN C—on time scales very much shorter than the time it takes for the time-dependent
oscillations in neutrino mixtures to “damp out.” This is an essential requirement if these
hypothetical short-distance processes are to be responsible for “selecting” the (constant)
U-matrix mixing parameters prior to neutrino mixing.

3.5.5 The current experimental situation in regard to 3-ﬂavor neutrino mixtures

The most recent analysis [49] of Super Kamiokande and SNO data on solar neutrinos [43] is
in good agreement with the prediction given by (84). If this prediction is eventually veriﬁed
by further detailed observations of neutrinos from distant astronomical sources (e.g., the sun
or a supernova), and/or in long-baseline terrestrial experiments (e.g., see a description of
proposed Kamland experiments in Ref. 50), this will provide qualitative support for the new
description of fundamental fermions, which requires, among other things, that the νe and
(νµ or ντ ) neutrino ﬂavors start, and end, “life” as topologically distinct quantum objects
(see Appendix A in Ref. 13, and Refs. 9, 38, 47). However, while it is conceivable that
experiments could still falsify (84), together with the assumption [40] that CP violation is
not maximal (i.e., sin2 δ
= 0), experimental veriﬁcation of these things would
not conﬁrm the new description or the proposed topological constraints of Section 3.5.2 [51].
A much better theoretical understanding of the dynamical signiﬁcance of the new 2-space
description of quarks and leptons, in terms of the new internal 2-vector coordinates, will
be required before one can be conﬁdent that, if ﬁnally veriﬁed, (84) really is a reﬂection
of new physics, e.g., underlying topological constraints [51]. Clearly, additional (crucial)
experimental consequences of the 2-space must be found if it is to be considered a serious
candidate for a description of nature.

3.6 Does the 2-space imply the Standard Model?

Perhaps the best evidence we have for a “layer” of new physics—located somewhere be-
tween the uniﬁcation scale, and the region of applicability of the standard model of particle
physics—is simply that by constraining the possibilities, the 2-space description seems to
imply something very similar to the standard model. Consider the following facts in support
of this hypothesis.

First, and foremost, we have found that owing to the 2-space parameter v = ln Mc,
where Mc is a measure of the strong-color “multiplicity,” a symmetry associated with strong
interactions such as SU(3)color seems to be more-or-less implicit in the 2-space description.
Second, because the 2-space determines that there are some 48 fundamental fermions and
antifermions [17], together with their associated global charges—identiﬁed with the global
charges associated with the accidental symmetries of the strong-electroweak Lagrangian—
the form of the Lagrangian is severely restricted. Third, it is clear that the 2-space dictates
that we are dealing here with ﬂavor doublets of quarks or leptons. And, this ﬂavor doublet
structure imposed by the 2-space, necessarily, severely restricts the possible interactions of
fundamental fermions [52]. For example, we know from the 2-space description that the
magnitude of the diﬀerence in electric charges between the “up” and “down” ﬂavors within
a ﬂavor doublet is the fundamental unit of electric charge. And, if there are transitions that
change an “up” ﬂavor to a “down” ﬂavor or vice versa, there must exist a weak intermediate
boson (with unit electric charge) to accomplish this. Thinking along these lines soon leads
to the notion of weak isospin, and SU(2)L ﬂavor doublets carrying weak isospin. Fourth and
ﬁnally, because the electric charge of ﬂavor-doublet members is “explained” by the 2-space
description, compatibility with electromagnetism, i.e., there is only one photon associated
with ﬂavor-doublet members (see Ref. 3, pp. 342–343), inevitably leads to the concept of
weak hypercharge and U(1)Y . So, while the 2-space certainly does not rigidly determine
these things, it does seem to severely limit the possibilities.

In this very general way, it seems that the 2-space, and especially whatever underlying
physics is responsible for it, ultimately determines the current form assumed by the standard
U(1)Y . However, until the under-
model of particle physics based on SU(3)color ×
lying dynamics responsible for the 2-space is fully understood, the foregoing connections will
remain speculative in nature.

4.0 Summary and Conclusions

It is widely believed that the explanation for fundamental-fermion (quark and lepton) ﬂa-
vors, ﬂavor doublets, and family replication is to be found in theories of quantum gravity
(e.g., superstrings). And, yet, as demonstrated in this paper and elsewhere [10], an analytic
continuation of a Hermitian matrix used to represent the fermion-number operator, leads to
a new internal description of quarks and leptons—a “layer” of new physics located some-
where between the uniﬁcation scale, and the region of applicability of the standard model of
particle physics—that also explains such things as family replication. The new description

29

[9–13] involves an (internal) 2-space, and two new associated 2-vector fermion observables
U and V (linearly-independent ﬂavor-deﬁning “coordinates”) that are somewhat analogous
to the spin coordinate. And, just as the spin coordinate explains certain subtleties of atomic
spectra (e.g., the ﬁne structure) these new 2-vector coordinates explain certain subtleties
of fundamental-fermion “spectra.” In particular, using the two new ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion
coordinates U and V, we have discovered, among other lesser things, that:

1) The so-called “accidental” symmetries of the Lagrangian describing strong and electroweak
interactions (of fundamental fermions) are not accidental, but instead seem to be imposed
on these Lagrangians by an underlying non-Euclidean 2-space—or whatever underlying dy-
namics is responsible for the 2-space, its quantization, and its associated selection rules. In
particular, a central conclusion of this work is this:

The global (ﬂavor-deﬁning) charges associated with the “accidental symmetries” of the La-
grangian describing strong and electroweak interactions of fundamental fermions, and the
global (ﬂavor-deﬁning) charges associated with the non-Euclidean 2-space, are (essentially)
one and the same charges.

2) Family replication is apparently little more than the number of diﬀerent physically ac-
ceptable ways—just three ways are predicted—that the “electric-charge” vector coordinate
Q, for both quark and lepton ﬂavor doublets, can be resolved in the 2-space into pairs of
linearly independent 2-vector coordinates U and V (i.e., Q = U + V). However, while this
description is reasonable, the underlying reasons for this “quantization” remain essentially
unknown.

3) Unlike the situation in the standard model, particles such as the u, c and t quarks are
characterized by certain associated internal topological diﬀerences. Similar topological dif-
ferences between diﬀerent neutrino ﬂavors may help explain recent observations of (nearly)
ντ mixing. And, this in turn, may be yet another indirect experimental indi-
bi-maximal νµ −
cation of new dynamics (related, in part, to topology) underlying the new 2-space description
of quarks and leptons.

Finally, because the (global) accidental symmetries of the Lagrangian are at least partly
determined by the 2-space, and because local symmetries such as SU(3)color, SU(2)L and
U(1)Y are also more-or-less implicit in the 2-space description, this description tends to imply
U(1)Y . However, while
the standard model of particle physics based on SU(3)color ×
progress has been made in making these connections, and in understanding the bewildering
number of fermion ﬂavors, two of the most important questions remain unanswered. First,
what is the detailed nature of the “layer” of new physics, which is supposed to be responsible
for the 2-space, its quantization, and its associated selection rules? Second, how does this
“layer” of new physics arise or emerge from physics at the uniﬁcation scale?

ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates (Q, U, V) are somewhat analogous to spin angular
momentum vectors or spin “coordinates” (i.e., the total angular momentum vector J),
there is one very important diﬀerence. All spin 1
2 ﬂavors or antiﬂavors carry the same
J and J2 = 1/2(1/2 + 1)¯h2. That is, neither J nor J2 distinguish between ﬂavors or
antiﬂavors whereas, as the term “ﬂavor-deﬁning” implies, every ﬂavor or antiﬂavor is
generally (but not always) associated with a diﬀerent set of ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion
coordinates (Q, U, V). These diﬀerences, between J and (Q, U, V), insure that while
J vectors for any number of ﬂavors and antiﬂavors can be superimposed (added), one
cannot superimpose ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates for two or more ﬂavors and
antiﬂavors (see Sec. 3.2 in the main text for further discussion). For, if one could do
this, these coordinates could not be self-consistently used to deﬁne individual “isolated”

31

ﬂavors. In other words, ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates deﬁne (isolated) ﬂavors or
antiﬂavors, not collections of arbitrary numbers of ﬂavors and antiﬂavors.

[15] We should remind the reader how ﬂavors are distinguished from one another in the stan-
dard model of particle physics. Except for mass diﬀerences, the strong and electroweak
interactions of quarks are identical. Hence, from the point of view of their interactions
alone, all quarks (leptons) are eﬀectively identical. Of course, these particles are not
identical, ﬁrst because the diﬀerent ﬂavors of quarks and leptons (in principle including
neutrinos) can, in fact, be distinguished by their masses. They can also be distinguished
by certain Lorentz 4-scalar “charges,” i.e., certain global charge-conjugation-reversing
(C-reversing) quantum numbers. These charges, being global in nature, do not in general
couple to ﬁelds of force like color charges do. They include charges such as baryon and
lepton number, strangeness, the third component of global isospin, muon and electron
numbers, and other similar global ﬂavor-deﬁning charges. While it is certainly true that
these ﬂavor-deﬁning charges can be associated with the so-called accidental symmetries
of the Lagrangian describing strong and electroweak interactions, [e.g., SU(3)ﬂavor], we
argue in this paper that these charges can also be thought of as arising at a more prim-
itive (more fundamental ) level, “below” or “beyond” the conventional standard model
structure.

[16] When weak interactions are “turned oﬀ,” ﬂavor eigenstates and mass eigenstates are
one and the same. For the most part, when we speak here of ﬂavor eigenstates, we are
referring to the situation where ﬂavor eigenstates and mass eigenstates are the same.

[17] Not counting spin states, we have 3 quark ﬂavor doublets in three colors each, which
3 = 18 states, while 3 lepton ﬂavor doublets in one “color” each (i.e., the
yields 3
1 = 6 states for a total of 24 matter
strong-color “multiplicity” is one), yields 3
particles. Combining these 24 matter particles with their 24 (distinguishable) antimatter
counterparts, yields a total of 48 fundamental fermions and antifermions. Not counting
spin or color states, we have a total of 12 ﬂavor eigenstates and 12 antiﬂavor eigenstates,
for a total of 24 ﬂavor and antiﬂavor eigenstates of fundamental fermions.

[18] We assume that, because there are only 13 known force-mediating fundamental bosons
(i.e., not counting spin states, we have the photon, the graviton, 8 gluons and 3 weak
intermediate vector bosons—none of which carry a ﬂavor index, and some of which are
their own antiparticles) in comparison with the 48 known fundamental fermions and
antifermions, the force-mediating bosons do not carry the new 2-vector ﬂavor-deﬁning
coordinates. For if they did, we would naturally expect to see many more force-mediating
bosons than we do. While there are, no doubt, much deeper reasons for this state of
aﬀairs, this “experimental” evidence is a reasonable indication that such ﬂavor-deﬁning
coordinates are at least a possibility in the fermion, but not in the boson sector.

[19] If there are supersymmetries, it is natural to assume that the ﬂavor-carrying boson
superpartners (squarks and sleptons) to the existing ﬂavor-carrying fundamental fermion
matter-particles (i.e., quarks and leptons), will also carry the new 2-vector coordinates
Q, U and V, but the ﬂavorless fermion superpartners (e.g., photinos, gluinos) to the
existing ﬂavorless force-mediating bosons (e.g., photons and gluons) will not.

[22] Even though F(v)diag = F(op) = σz, these two matrices act on entirely diﬀerent spaces,
since F(op) is associated with the constant cos θ = 1, and the variable phase-factor

[23] The term “non-Euclidean” is usually reserved for the geometry of curved spaces. How-
ever, to avoid confusing the ﬂat “Lorentzian” 2-D geometry (and discrete transfor-
mations therein) with the ﬂat Lorentzian 4-D geometry of spacetime (and continuous
transformations therein), we prefer to use a term other than “Lorentzian” to describe
the 2-space. In particular, because this 2-space is not Euclidean, we choose to break
with tradition, and refer to this ﬂat space as being “not-Euclidean,” or more correctly,
non-Euclidean.

[24] O. B¨ar and U. J. Wiese, “Can One See the Number of Colors?”, arXiv:hep-ph/0105258
v1, 24 May 2001. These authors show that in low-energy experiments involving only

33

pions and photons, it is impossible to “see” the number of quark colors Mc. In partic-
ular, they show that the decay width of the π0
γγ is not, as is commonly claimed,
proportional to M 2
c . They further show that in such low-energy situations other values
of Mc including Mc = 5, 7, 9, . . . , are just as reasonable as Mc = 3. However, when all
available experimental data is properly taken into account, the number of quark colors
is found to be the widely accepted number Mc = 3.

±

[25] While it seems certain that Mc = 1(3) characterizes ordinary leptons (quarks) it is
not at all certain that other extraordinary or “exotic” values of Mc, namely, Mc =
5, 7, 9, . . . , are physically excluded. While we may object to such values on the grounds
2/5), and
that they lead to as yet unseen “quarks” with unusual electric charges (e.g.,
to corresponding strong interactions based on SU(5)color, SU(7)color, SU(9)color, and so
on, with their associated color-neutral composites (e.g., when Mc = 5, 5 “quarks” would
bind “strongly” to form a color-neutral “baryon”) we have found no stronger reasons
than these for excluding such states. Moreover, even if all of these states “lived” together
in the world at the same time, it is still possible, in principle, that triangle anomalies
could be canceled using ordinary leptons (Mc = 1) and an inﬁnite “tower” of “quarks”
with Mc = 3, 5, 7, 9, . . . , in the same way that triangle anomalies associated with Mc = 1
and Mc = 3 alone are canceled. It is also possible that something similar to the known
three-family structure could be retained. This might be accomplished by arranging for
ordinary leptons (Mc = 1) to be placed in a particular family along with an inﬁnite tower
of “quarks,” starting with ordinary quarks (Mc = 3), but also including extraordinary
or exotic “quarks” with Mc = 5, 7, 9, . . . . Admittedly, this speculative picture leads to
a rather “messy” world, but since the absence of evidence for such unusual “quark”
states is not the same thing as evidence of their absence, we cannot simply exclude this
possibility out of hand. Moreover, there is potential theoretical justiﬁcation in string
theories for such exotic fractionally-charged particles. However, it is currently unknown
if the proposed exotic fractionally-charged “quark” states with Mc = 5, 7, 9, . . . , could be
consistent with any existing string theory, since string theories tend to predict a relative
plethora of particles having arbitrary fractional charges. Accordingly, until much more
is known about the 2-space description, and exactly how it relates to more fundamental
treatments such as string theory, it currently seems unlikely that exotic “quarks” with
Mc = 5, 7, 9, . . . , exist in nature.

[26] Any acceptable 2

2 matrix F(v) possesses just two, real linearly-independent eigen-
vectors, call them Q and Qc, corresponding to the two real eigenvalues fm and fa,
respectively. Therefore, the matrix F(v) can be thought of as “producing” the conven-
tional single-particle fermion numbers fm and fa via the 2-space eigenvalue equations

respectively.

The 2-vector Q (and its scalar components—the electric charges of quarks and
leptons) describes matter, while the linearly-independent 2-vector Qc describes its anti-
matter counterpart. The superscript c on Qc is merely a label signifying antimatter. It
is not an exponent or a symbol for complex conjugation. As such, it signiﬁes only that
the 2-vectors Q and Qc are real vectors associated with (“carried by,” “representing,”
etc.) individual fundamental-fermions or antifermions, respectively, not state vectors in
some Hilbert space.

[27] It is important to point out that the various C-reversing 2-scalars associated with the
internal 2-space description are taken to be Lorentz 4-scalars in an external spacetime
setting. That is, because q1 and q2 are Lorentz 4-scalars in 4-D spacetime, the com-
ponents of the 2-vectors U and V, and the scalar products Q2, U2, V2, U
V are
also Lorentz 4-scalars. This connection strengthens the idea that these numbers deﬁne
ﬂavors in a Lorentz-invariant way.

Vol. 159, No. 5, 1967; S. Weinberg, The Quantum Theory of Fields, Vol. III Supersym-
metry, Cambridge University Press, New York, 2000, pp. 2, 12–21. According to the
Coleman-Mandula theorem, the possible symmetries of the S-matrix include ordinary
internal symmetries whose generators Bk are independent of energy-momentum and
spin. In other words, these group generators are Lorentz 4-“scalars.” In the present
paper our internal 2-scalars—these are components, or scalar products, of the new
ﬂavor-deﬁning fermion coordinates Q, U and V—are also assumed to be Lorentz 4-
scalars. These 2-scalars are identiﬁed with certain ﬂavor-deﬁning “charges” such as
baryon number, lepton number, strangeness, charm and so on. In this way, the new de-
scription honors the spirit of the Coleman-Mandula theorem, even though the internal
algebraic and geometric structure we propose is, in most cases, quite diﬀerent from the
internal symmetries referred to in the Coleman-Mandula theorem. Our description is,
if you will, a kind of “evasion” of the Coleman-Mandula theorem without violating this
theorem.

[29] The term “underlying dynamics” or “dynamics” as employed in this paper, refers to
quantum dynamics supplemented by whatever “layer” of new physics (e.g., topolog-
ical “energy barriers”) that may lie between the uniﬁcation scale, and the region of
applicability of the standard model of particle physics.

[30] Strictly speaking, besides the speciﬁcation of global ﬂavor-deﬁning charges, the overall
quantum state of a fundamental fermion would, necessarily, involve a speciﬁcation of
the spin state, the energy-momentum state and so on, together with a speciﬁcation of
the particular mix of local color (gauge)-charges R, W , B, G and Y carried by each
fundamental fermion. This color-mix would be determined, in turn, by something like
a complementary, local SU(5) color-dependent gauge description.

[31] S. Perlis, Theory of Matrices, Dover Publications Inc., New York, 1991, p. 31. By
deﬁnition, in any linear vector 2-space, a 2-vector such as Q can always be resolved into
a pair (no more, or less) of linearly independent vectors U and V as Q = U + V.

[32] When we say that the vectors Q, U and V are observables, we mean that their associated
component “charges” are mutually-commuting simultaneous observables. Hence, all of
these charge-like components can be known in principle, at the same time, meaning
that the vectors Q, U and V can be known simultaneously. Thus the vector “triad”
(Q, U, V) is a well deﬁned geometric object. Moreover, since Q, U, V are each Lorentz-
invariant, vector triads “appear” the same to all observers located in arbitrary inertial
coordinate systems.

[33] Given the row vector Qq = (q1, q2), and the column vectors

we
see that the component quark charges associated with Qq are just the non-Euclidean

In a similar way, and for reasons of internal consistency, a hypothetical vector such as
3Qq would have to be projected upon the same axes
to obtain the

this case. Other charges such as q = (2q1 + q2) cannot be obtained by means of such

[35] It is shown elsewhere (see Ref. 9, pp. 63–65 in the current reference list) that the matri-
ces R and R−1 are charge-conjugation-reversing (C-reversing). In particular, the com-
ponents of R and R−1 transform like C-reversing, Lorentz-invariant (4-scalar) charges.
And, this in turn means that R and R−1 are Lorentz-invariant.

law of thermodynamics, states: For an isolated physical system the degree of symmetry
cannot decrease as the system evolves, but either remains constant or increases.

[37] Note that the change described in ∆U = U2 −

U1 involves the “addition” of the
U1. However, this addition does not take place at the same spacetime

vectors U2 and

−

36

U1 describes a transition in which the initial U-vector
coordinate. That is, ∆U = U2 −
describing a particle is U1, and the ﬁnal U-vector describing the particle (possibly
a diﬀerent particle) is U2. That is, this transition involves only one current. So, the
U1 does not violate our rule that like
“addition” expressed by the change ∆U = U2 −
2-vectors (i.e., Q, U or V) for two or more fundamental fermions cannot be added or
superimposed. The same arguments obviously apply to changes described by ∆Q and
∆V.

[38] D. J. Thouless, Topological Quantum Numbers in Nonrelativistic Physics, World Sci-
entiﬁc, Singapore, 1998. Numerous examples from physics and mathematics could be
cited to establish the following very general principle:

In physical systems characterized by a well deﬁned topology, topology-change tends to be
suppressed, relative to the condition of topology-maintenance.

The basis for this principle is that topology change involves either an energy “expense”
(an energy “barrier” must be overcome) or a violation of some “topological charge”
conservation law, or both. In general, we expect this principle to apply to any dis-
continuous operation such as the abstract equivalent of “tearing,” and subsequently
“glueing,” surfaces back together to form states with new topologies. For example, one
cannot continuously deform a doughnut into a sphere. It must ﬁrst be “cut” and then
“glued” back together in a new way to achieve such a transformation.

Now, given the “facts” regarding the associated topology of neutrinos with respect
to the (abstract) internal transformation F(v), and assuming that there are no “energy
barriers” associated with transitions between neutrinos having the same associated topol-
ogy, the foregoing principle suggests that these facts could have the following dynamical
signiﬁcance:
νβ) is suppressed by
Associated topology change in neutrino-neutrino transitions (να →
topological energy and/or topological charge “barriers,” while associated topology main-
tenance in neutrino-neutrino transitions is relatively enhanced.

It should be emphasized that even though the νµ and ντ neutrinos have the same
associated topology with respect to F(v), they are quite distinct in other respects.
For example, in conventional weak decays or weak capture reactions involving these
particles, mu- and tau- numbers are separately conserved.

[39] The baryon (lepton) asymmetry of the universe insures that B (L) are not absolutely
conserved. However, violation of these conservation laws is very strongly suppressed as
evidenced by the long life of the proton.

[40] H. Georgi and S. L. Glashow, “Neutrinos on Earth and in the Heavens,” arXiv:hep-
ph/9808293, and hep-ph/9808293 v2, page 5, Eq. (20). It is interesting, and probably
signiﬁcant that Georgi and Glashow independently arrived at Eq. (84) in the main text
of the present paper (see Eq. 20 in their paper) starting from six experimental neutrino

37

“facts,” some of which are completely diﬀerent than the facts and assumptions employed
in the present paper. In particular, these authors began by assuming

1. There are just three chiral neutrino states having Majorana masses.

2. Atmospheric neutrinos rarely oscillate into electron neutrinos.

3. Atmospheric muon neutrinos suﬀer maximal, or nearly maximal, two ﬂavor oscil-

lations into tau neutrinos.

4. & 5. Two experimentally (and theoretically) motivated assumptions regarding the order
of magnitude of individual neutrino masses, and various mass squared diﬀerences.

and

6. Neutrinoless double beta decay either does not occur or is highly suppressed.

Given these six “facts” these authors derived both the neutrino mass matrix, and
partially determined the associated CKM-like unitary matrix U, which describes neu-
trino mixtures. From U they then derived Eq. (84) in the present paper. In closing, these
authors also noted that CP-violation in this situation could be “superweak.” Clearly,
this would be consistent with the assumption in the present paper that CP-violation is
not maximal, i.e., sin2 δ

= 1 or cos2 δ

= 0.

While the present approach, and that of Georgi and Glashow in deriving Eq. (20)
in their paper, are quite diﬀerent they are, nevertheless, expected to be compatible. In
particular, we anticipate that such things as neutrino masses and mixing parameters,
ultimately owe their existence to physics at a deeper level, where topological consider-
ations, of the kind proposed in the present paper, are expected to play an important
role.

topological “defects” due to thermal ﬂuctuations at phase transitions) abounds. For ex-
ample, otherwise persistent (“conserved”) topological defects in crystals can be destroyed
by raising the temperature suﬃciently (i.e., by melting the crystal). Similarly, other-
wise persistent (“conserved”) magnetic ﬂux-tubes in Type II superconductors and/or
vortices in a superﬂuid, can both be destroyed by raising the temperature above the
critical temperature Tc. And, conversely, topological defects are always created when
such macroscopic systems ﬁrst condense (or crystallize) as the temperature is lowered.
We imagine that something roughly similar can happen when quantum-ﬂuctuations
(vacuum ﬂuctuations) act on otherwise very similar quantum objects (i.e., quantum ob-
jects such as neutrinos having the same electric charge, spin, lepton number, and nearly

identical mass) that also happen to start “life” as topologically-distinct quantum ob-
jects. That is, we are assuming that, if not prevented by some absolute conservation law,
transitions between such states (e.g., νe and ντ neutrinos) will be catalyzed by quantum
ﬂuctuations.

Fourth Family of Quarks and Leptons, First International Symposium, edited by D. B.
Cline and Amarjit Soni, Annals of The New York Academy of Sciences, New York,
Volume 518, 1987, p. 190. According to the scheme described in the present paper,
the fundamental fermions d, νe(s, b, νµ, ντ ) have the topology associated with a cylinder
(M¨obius strip) with respect to the internal transformation F(v). Hence, we imagine that
if, in some imaginary world, quark couplings to hypothetical Higgs mass-producing ﬁelds
were nearly “switched oﬀ,” the resulting “low” mass d, s and b quark mixtures (located
inside strongly-bound quark composites) could conceivably look very much like unbound
or “free” νe, νµ and ντ low mass neutrino mixtures—owing to topological inﬂuences of
exactly the kind proposed in the present paper. In particular, in this imaginary world,
we would expect the s and b quarks (like the νµ and ντ neutrinos, respectively) to exhibit
(nearly) bi-maximal mixing. However, because of uncertainty-principle considerations,
and because the b quark mass is, in the “real” world, very much larger than the d and
s quark masses, very little mixing with the b quark occurs in d, s, b quark mixtures
in spite of topological inﬂuences that would tend to encourage this. Thus, in the case
of strongly-interacting quarks, it seems very likely that topological constraints of the
kind considered in the present paper can, at most, play a minor role in determining
such things as CKM-type matrix elements. For example, in the case of d and s quarks,
Gronau shows that the mixing angle θc depends on quark masses since the matrix
element V12, and the d, s quark masses md and ms, respectively, are known to be
empirically related via V12 = sin θc =
= 0. This is nothing like
the corresponding matrix element for νe and νµ neutrinos found in the present paper.
Thus, although a detailed understanding of these matters is far from being achieved, it
appears that topological inﬂuences are allowed to play a major role in neutrino, but not
in quark mixing, because of the small value, and near degeneracy of neutrino masses in
comparison to the large diﬀerences between d, s and b quark masses.

[45] Although conventional treatments of neutrino mixing do not involve topological consid-
erations, they do describe mixing among neutrinos that initially have a deﬁnite ﬂavor.
And, because we argue that a neutrino with a deﬁnite ﬂavor is also associated with a
deﬁnite topology, hereinafter we will often use these terms together as in “ . . . neutrinos
have a deﬁnite ﬂavor and associated topology.”

[51] Even if the matrix M in Eq. (84) in the main text is veriﬁed by experiment, we could not
be certain that the constraints expressed by items A), B) and C) in Section 3.5.2, are
topological constraints related to the 2-space description of quarks and leptons. There
are three basic reasons for this assertion.

First, we do not know why the topology of vector triads [with respect to the internal
transformation F(v)] should be relevant to neutrino mixing. Second, we do not have
any detailed understanding of the hypothetical mechanism that supplies the “energy
barriers” or “topological charge conservation laws” that serve to inhibit topology change
in neutrino mixing. Third, as indicated in Ref. 13, Appendix A (Sec. A.4) in this list,
we cannot be absolutely certain that the νµ neutrino is associated with the requisite
second-family M¨obius topology with respect to F(v). What we do know with certainty
is that, regardless of their physical origins, the constraints of Section 3.5.2, together

[52] However, all of the ﬂavor-deﬁning charges associated with these 2-space ﬂavor doublets
are global in nature, so this tells us nothing directly about the interactions of ﬂavor
doublet members. Nevertheless, the “up”–“down” ﬂavor doublet structure imposed by
the 2-space, necessarily, severely restricts the possible interactions.
